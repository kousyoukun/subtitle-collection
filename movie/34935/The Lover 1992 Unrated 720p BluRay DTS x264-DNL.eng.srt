1
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,417
Very early in my life
it was too late.

2
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:51,543
At 18,
it was already too late.

3
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:53,793
At 18, I aged.

4
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:56,335
This aging was brutal.

5
00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:59,794
This aging, I saw it
spread over my features...

6
00:02:59,837 --> 00:03:02,045
one by one.

7
00:03:02,088 --> 00:03:04,504
Instead of being
frightened by it...

8
00:03:04,546 --> 00:03:06,963
I saw this aging of my face...

9
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:09,047
with the same sort
of interest...

10
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,631
I might have taken,
for example...

11
00:03:11,673 --> 00:03:13,881
in the reading of a book.

12
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:16,549
That new face, I kept it.

13
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:18,715
It's kept
the same contours...

14
00:03:18,757 --> 00:03:21,299
but its matter
is destroyed.

15
00:03:21,342 --> 00:03:24,342
I have a destroyed face.

16
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:27,843
Let me tell you again.

17
00:03:27,885 --> 00:03:29,760
I'm 15 1/2.

18
00:03:29,803 --> 00:03:33,053
It's the crossing
of a ferry on the Mekong.

19
00:04:31,775 --> 00:04:33,443
Look at me.

20
00:04:33,485 --> 00:04:35,443
I'm 15 1/2.

21
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,699
It's the crossing
of the river.

22
00:05:00,742 --> 00:05:03,450
When I go back to Saigon...

23
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:05,742
it's as though
I'm on a journey...

24
00:05:05,784 --> 00:05:08,284
especially
when I take the bus.

25
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:11,744
That day, it's the end
of the school holidays.

26
00:05:11,786 --> 00:05:14,411
I don't remember which one.

27
00:05:14,454 --> 00:05:17,287
I went to spend it in Sa-Dec
with my two brothers...

28
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:19,911
in my mother's tight house...

29
00:05:19,954 --> 00:05:22,288
behind the bush school...

30
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:25,455
in the horror
of the Sa-Dec house.

31
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:04,048
The big pieces are mine.

32
00:06:10,842 --> 00:06:13,925
Why yours?

33
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:16,426
Because that's the way it is.

34
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:17,801
I wish you'd die.

35
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:34,654
Paul?

36
00:07:39,113 --> 00:07:40,405
Paulo?

37
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:48,782
Paul, come to bed.

38
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:53,491
You mustn't be afraid
anymore:

39
00:07:53,492 --> 00:07:56,033
Not of Pierre,
not of anything.

40
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,076
Never again, you know.

41
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,661
Never again.

42
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:23,957
He came back?

43
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:25,791
I see him on the balcony...

44
00:08:25,832 --> 00:08:28,333
sleeping
in the night outside...

45
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:29,833
doesn't want to go
to his room.

46
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,417
He's too scared of Pierre.

47
00:08:33,877 --> 00:08:36,794
Me, it's when he's outside
that I'm afraid.

48
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,336
I'm afraid
he'll leave like that.

49
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,879
He'll get lost.

50
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,295
It can happen
with that kind of child.

51
00:08:44,338 --> 00:08:46,588
That's not true.

52
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,129
You're not afraid for Paul.

53
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:50,464
You're only afraid for Pierre.

54
00:08:50,506 --> 00:08:52,005
Why is it
that you love him so much...

55
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:55,257
and not us...never?

56
00:08:57,007 --> 00:08:59,507
I love all three
of my children the same.

57
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:01,967
That's not true.
It's not true!

58
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,843
Answer! Why is it
that you love him so much...

59
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,176
and not us?

60
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:12,261
I don't know why.

61
00:09:21,346 --> 00:09:22,513
Yesterday...

62
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:26,180
I wrote to Saigon...

63
00:09:26,181 --> 00:09:28,557
to ask for Pierre's
repatriation.

64
00:09:28,598 --> 00:09:29,765
What?

65
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:31,766
I'm sending him back
to France.

66
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:33,474
You're happy?

67
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:36,600
He stole at
the opium den again.

68
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:40,642
I can't pay any longer.

69
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:42,977
It's over.

70
00:09:46,103 --> 00:09:47,936
It's not possible anymore.

71
00:09:56,647 --> 00:09:59,397
Mom, hurry up,
or I'll miss the bus.

72
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,540
Bye, Paulo.

73
00:11:33,004 --> 00:11:35,171
Take care.

74
00:11:35,213 --> 00:11:36,880
Yes, Mom.

75
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,671
When are you coming back?

76
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:41,173
For Mardi Gras.
I already told you.

77
00:11:41,173 --> 00:11:43,006
Oh. I forgot.

78
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,178
So that day...

79
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,427
I'm going back to Saigon.

80
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:08,180
I'm wearing my cabaret shoes
and my man's hat.

81
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,679
No woman, no young girl
wears a man's fedora...

82
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,680
in that colony in those days.

83
00:12:14,723 --> 00:12:17,014
No native woman, either.

84
00:12:17,098 --> 00:12:19,848
That hat, I never leave it.

85
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:22,848
I have that, this hat.

86
00:12:22,891 --> 00:12:25,849
That all by itself
makes me whole.

87
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,975
I'm never without it.

88
00:13:35,326 --> 00:13:36,825
So it's the crossing...

89
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:39,076
of one of the branches
of the Mekong...

90
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,869
on the ferry that's between
Vinh Long and Sa-Dec...

91
00:13:42,869 --> 00:13:46,285
in the great plains
of mud and rice...

92
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:48,370
of southern Indochina...

93
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:50,371
the plain of the birds.

94
00:15:32,062 --> 00:15:35,187
Excuse me, mademoiselle.
Do you smoke?

95
00:15:38,064 --> 00:15:39,397
No, thank you.

96
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,611
I'm sorry.

97
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,361
It's so surprising...

98
00:16:04,362 --> 00:16:07,947
a young white girl
on a native bus.

99
00:16:21,242 --> 00:16:24,700
I like your hat.
It's original...

100
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,700
a man's hat
on a young girl.

101
00:16:32,202 --> 00:16:33,703
And you're pretty.

102
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:36,202
You can do
anything you like.

103
00:16:41,704 --> 00:16:43,079
You're who?

104
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:50,372
-I live in Vinh Long.
-Where in Vinh Long?

105
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:54,749
On the river just outside.
The big house with the terraces.

106
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:56,875
The blue stone one?

107
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:58,333
Yes.

108
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,417
It's a Chinese house.

109
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:02,876
I am Chinese.

110
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,918
Chinese.

111
00:17:06,002 --> 00:17:08,877
He's from
that financial minority...

112
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:11,586
that owns all the popular
housing of the colony.

113
00:17:11,628 --> 00:17:13,378
He's back from Paris...

114
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,420
where he undertook
some business studies.

115
00:17:16,504 --> 00:17:17,713
He's the one...

116
00:17:17,755 --> 00:17:20,755
who was crossing
the Mekong that day...

117
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,548
towards Saigon.

118
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:27,591
If you want, I can
drive you to Saigon.

119
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:06,558
Do you know her?

120
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:08,559
She's the administrator's
wife...

121
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:10,892
Mrs. Stretter,
Anne-Marie.

122
00:18:13,603 --> 00:18:15,060
Do you want one?

123
00:18:15,102 --> 00:18:16,894
Yes, thank you.

124
00:18:29,272 --> 00:18:31,689
Is it true, that story
about the young man...

125
00:18:31,732 --> 00:18:34,565
who killed himself
for her?

126
00:18:34,566 --> 00:18:35,566
Don't know.

127
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,901
Yes, it's true.

128
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:49,027
On the marketplace
at Louang Prabang...

129
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,819
the day she left.

130
00:18:50,903 --> 00:18:52,569
He was her lover.

131
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,038
The smoke
doesn't bother you?

132
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,538
I mean, in here?

133
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:38,039
No, not at all.

134
00:19:55,835 --> 00:19:57,960
You're at
Saigon High School?

135
00:19:58,003 --> 00:20:00,087
Yes, but
I sleep elsewhere...

136
00:20:00,128 --> 00:20:03,544
at the Lyautey
Boardinghouse.

137
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:04,921
Do you like studying?

138
00:20:04,963 --> 00:20:07,046
Yes. I find it interesting.

139
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:12,755
What grade are you in?

140
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:14,756
11th.

141
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,798
And you're...

142
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,882
uh...17.

143
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:20,092
And you?

144
00:20:21,383 --> 00:20:23,133
32...

145
00:20:23,217 --> 00:20:25,051
and jobless.

146
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:27,133
And Chinese, what's more.

147
00:20:29,968 --> 00:20:33,302
What's more...yes.

148
00:20:35,886 --> 00:20:38,886
You look so beautiful
when you say that.

149
00:20:57,892 --> 00:21:00,601
Since my mother's death,
my father has lived on his cot.

150
00:21:00,643 --> 00:21:02,435
He never leaves
his opium pipe...

151
00:21:02,477 --> 00:21:05,268
and he nearly
doesn't eat anymore.

152
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:07,936
I never guessed
the depth of their fondness.

153
00:21:07,979 --> 00:21:09,770
There it's been 10 years...

154
00:21:09,812 --> 00:21:12,436
that's he's taken care
of his business like that...

155
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,479
from his bed.

156
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:17,479
He stares
at the river, you see.

157
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
I see.

158
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:24,147
Yes, I miss Paris--

159
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:25,399
the parties,

160
00:21:25,441 --> 00:21:27,899
the evenings
in Montparnasse...

161
00:21:27,941 --> 00:21:29,316
the coupole.

162
00:21:30,775 --> 00:21:32,733
Do you know the coupole?

163
00:21:32,776 --> 00:21:34,401
I went to France once.

164
00:21:34,442 --> 00:21:37,234
It was in the north,
near the Belgian border.

165
00:21:37,277 --> 00:21:39,943
I only know here--
the Mekong, Saigon.

166
00:21:39,986 --> 00:21:41,069
You like Saigon?

167
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:43,486
Yes, I like Saigon.

168
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:46,903
I like Saigon, too.
Cholon above all.

169
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:49,488
Cholon, it's like China.

170
00:24:57,117 --> 00:24:59,784
That's it. It's here.

171
00:25:43,378 --> 00:25:44,628
Good-bye.

172
00:26:34,016 --> 00:26:36,974
You got here
earlier than usual.

173
00:26:37,017 --> 00:26:40,559
I met someone on the ferry.
He drove me here.

174
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:42,434
A Chinaman.

175
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:49,852
Helene is the only other
white girl...

176
00:26:49,895 --> 00:26:52,479
in the boardinghouse.

177
00:26:52,521 --> 00:26:54,396
Helene, she is immodest.

178
00:26:54,397 --> 00:26:56,896
She doesn't realize.

179
00:26:56,897 --> 00:26:59,980
She walks naked
in the dormitory.

180
00:27:00,022 --> 00:27:02,897
She doesn't know
that she's very beautiful.

181
00:27:02,898 --> 00:27:04,023
She's innocent...

182
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:06,565
lingering on in youth.

183
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:12,858
Hey, I forgot
to tell you something.

184
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,942
There's a girl...

185
00:27:13,983 --> 00:27:15,858
the assistant mistresses
found her...

186
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,776
she was a prostitute
every evening...

187
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:19,361
behind the wall.

188
00:27:19,403 --> 00:27:20,860
Nobody noticed anything.

189
00:27:20,902 --> 00:27:22,860
-Who?
-Alice.

190
00:27:22,903 --> 00:27:25,153
Alice? Who's she going with
like that?

191
00:27:25,196 --> 00:27:27,821
Anybody,
people walking by.

192
00:27:30,113 --> 00:27:32,363
It's always appealed to me.

193
00:27:32,406 --> 00:27:33,614
What?

194
00:27:34,698 --> 00:27:37,114
To go with men
you don't know.

195
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:40,115
You don't even see them.
Nothing.

196
00:27:40,157 --> 00:27:42,074
You'll never know
their face.

197
00:27:43,658 --> 00:27:45,616
Do you think
we're all like that?

198
00:27:45,658 --> 00:27:49,117
Yes. The assistant
mistresses, too.

199
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:51,909
Every woman.

200
00:27:51,952 --> 00:27:53,535
Actually, I'd rather
be a prostitute...

201
00:27:53,577 --> 00:27:55,536
than take care of lepers.

202
00:27:57,328 --> 00:27:59,995
What are you
talking about again?

203
00:28:00,037 --> 00:28:01,496
That's what everybody
says here.

204
00:28:01,538 --> 00:28:02,912
They say they want us
to study...

205
00:28:02,912 --> 00:28:04,204
but it's not true.

206
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:05,372
They take us into boarding...

207
00:28:05,414 --> 00:28:07,372
so they can send us
to the lazarets...

208
00:28:07,415 --> 00:28:08,664
with the lepers,
the plague-stricken...

209
00:28:08,706 --> 00:28:10,622
the cholera-ridden.

210
00:28:10,665 --> 00:28:12,665
I'd rather be a prostitute.

211
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:23,417
They'd be lucky, those men.

212
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,600
I'm the matador.
You are the bull.

213
00:32:17,642 --> 00:32:20,433
Eyes on one level.
Shoulders straight.

214
00:32:20,476 --> 00:32:22,809
1...

215
00:32:22,893 --> 00:32:24,102
2...

216
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:25,810
3...4...

217
00:32:25,894 --> 00:32:27,644
5...6.

218
00:32:36,271 --> 00:32:37,939
Look over my left shoulder...

219
00:32:37,939 --> 00:32:41,439
back out, arms locked,
bottom in.

220
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:43,564
And 1 and 2
and 3 and 4...

221
00:32:43,607 --> 00:32:45,440
and 5 and 6
and 7 and 8.

222
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,398
And 1 and 2
and 3 and 4.

223
00:32:47,441 --> 00:32:49,941
5, 6, 7, 8.

224
00:32:49,942 --> 00:32:53,399
It happened very quickly
that day, a holiday...

225
00:32:53,442 --> 00:32:54,776
a Thursday.

226
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:58,442
He came
that Thursday afternoon...

227
00:32:58,443 --> 00:32:59,944
to the boardinghouse.

228
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:02,777
He came to wait for her
with the big black car.

229
00:34:23,547 --> 00:34:25,588
It's early
in the afternoon...

230
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:27,798
the time of the siesta.

231
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,799
It's in Cholon...

232
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:32,298
in the alleyways of Cholon...

233
00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:34,967
in the smell of soup,
roast meat...

234
00:34:34,968 --> 00:34:38,300
jasmine, dust,
charcoal fire...

235
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:41,802
in the smell
of the Chinese town.

236
00:34:52,805 --> 00:34:53,930
Please.

237
00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:19,311
I...l didn't choose
the furniture.

238
00:35:19,311 --> 00:35:22,311
It's--it's my father,
bought me this.

239
00:35:24,771 --> 00:35:27,730
Young, rich Chinese
have mistresses...

240
00:35:27,772 --> 00:35:30,771
and they call this
the bachelor's room.

241
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,647
Do you have
many mistresses?

242
00:35:37,275 --> 00:35:41,734
Do you like the idea
of me having mistresses?

243
00:35:41,775 --> 00:35:43,483
Yes, I do.

244
00:35:50,694 --> 00:35:52,527
So you followed me here...

245
00:35:52,612 --> 00:35:54,694
as you would have
followed anyone.

246
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,862
I wouldn't know.

247
00:35:56,945 --> 00:35:59,945
I've never followed
anyone into a room yet.

248
00:36:05,781 --> 00:36:09,490
I'm...I'm afraid...

249
00:36:12,283 --> 00:36:14,617
I'm afraid of loving you.

250
00:36:17,825 --> 00:36:20,451
Listen, we'll leave.
We'll come back some other time.

251
00:36:20,493 --> 00:36:23,035
Well, I'd rather
you didn't love me.

252
00:36:26,828 --> 00:36:29,995
I want you to do as you
usually do with other women.

253
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,330
Is that what you want?

254
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,624
Yes.

255
00:37:13,505 --> 00:37:15,672
I know
you'll never love me.

256
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,049
I...

257
00:37:21,174 --> 00:37:23,299
I don't know.

258
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:26,300
I don't want you to talk.

259
00:37:26,343 --> 00:37:28,134
Just do as usual.

260
00:38:09,144 --> 00:38:12,311
He tore the dress off.

261
00:38:12,354 --> 00:38:15,979
He tore the little white
underpants off...

262
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:18,522
and he carried her like that...

263
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:21,480
naked, to the bed.

264
00:38:59,532 --> 00:39:02,073
Once on the bed...

265
00:39:02,157 --> 00:39:04,324
fear overcomes him.

266
00:39:04,325 --> 00:39:05,658
I can't.

267
00:39:05,658 --> 00:39:07,325
He says it's not true...

268
00:39:07,368 --> 00:39:09,118
that she's too little...

269
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:11,826
that he can't do
such a thing.

270
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:13,493
So...

271
00:39:31,665 --> 00:39:35,166
So she's the one who does it.

272
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:37,499
Her eyes closed...

273
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,999
she undresses him...

274
00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:43,166
button by button...

275
00:39:43,209 --> 00:39:44,709
sleeve by sleeve.

276
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,835
The skin.

277
00:39:53,212 --> 00:39:55,003
The skin.

278
00:40:06,715 --> 00:40:10,508
The skin is
of a sumptuous softness.

279
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:14,007
The body is hairless...

280
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,509
without
any virility at all...

281
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:20,218
other than that of the sex.

282
00:40:20,302 --> 00:40:22,468
She doesn't look him
in the face.

283
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,677
She touches him.

284
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:29,512
She touches
the softness of the sex...

285
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:31,512
of the skin.

286
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:35,222
She caresses the golden hue...

287
00:40:35,264 --> 00:40:37,180
the unknown novelty.

288
00:42:27,416 --> 00:42:29,875
I still see
the place of distress...

289
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:31,792
shipwrecked...

290
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:33,292
the distempered walls...

291
00:42:33,335 --> 00:42:37,044
the slatted shutters
giving up to the furnace.

292
00:42:37,085 --> 00:42:38,210
The soiling of the blood.

293
00:42:57,715 --> 00:42:59,632
I remember well.

294
00:42:59,673 --> 00:43:01,882
The room is dark.

295
00:43:01,924 --> 00:43:03,258
It's surrounded by...

296
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,591
the never-ending clamor
of the town...

297
00:43:06,634 --> 00:43:08,383
carried away by the town...

298
00:43:08,426 --> 00:43:10,718
by the flow of the town.

299
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,551
My body was in
that public noise...

300
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:16,177
this passing by
from the outside...

301
00:43:16,178 --> 00:43:18,219
exposed.

302
00:43:19,262 --> 00:43:24,096
The sea, I thought...

303
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,347
the immensity.

304
00:43:38,391 --> 00:43:40,933
What are you
thinking about?

305
00:43:44,768 --> 00:43:45,935
They're dead.

306
00:43:58,605 --> 00:44:00,521
Did it hurt you?

307
00:44:02,189 --> 00:44:03,439
No.

308
00:44:10,274 --> 00:44:11,399
Are you sad?

309
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,193
Yes, I guess.

310
00:44:16,235 --> 00:44:18,068
A little.

311
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:19,693
I don't know.

312
00:44:24,444 --> 00:44:28,237
It's because we've made love
during the daytime...

313
00:44:28,279 --> 00:44:30,404
in the dead
of the heat.

314
00:44:31,446 --> 00:44:33,238
No.

315
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,738
It's me.

316
00:44:36,114 --> 00:44:38,323
I'm always
a little sad.

317
00:44:40,615 --> 00:44:42,074
I'm like my mother.

318
00:44:43,866 --> 00:44:45,282
When I told her
I'd be a writer...

319
00:44:45,324 --> 00:44:47,324
she shrugged.

320
00:44:47,367 --> 00:44:49,367
She said it's not work...

321
00:44:49,368 --> 00:44:51,243
it's a childish idea.

322
00:44:51,284 --> 00:44:54,701
She wants me to do maths,
my mother does...

323
00:44:54,785 --> 00:44:56,202
to earn money.

324
00:44:57,744 --> 00:44:59,702
What do you want to write?

325
00:44:59,787 --> 00:45:00,912
Books.

326
00:45:00,954 --> 00:45:02,246
Novels...

327
00:45:02,287 --> 00:45:04,246
about my elder brother...

328
00:45:04,288 --> 00:45:05,746
to kill him...

329
00:45:05,788 --> 00:45:07,746
to see him in pain...

330
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:09,497
to make him die.

331
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:14,206
About my younger brother
to save him.

332
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:16,249
And about that--

333
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:19,582
about my mother's sadness.

334
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:21,749
About the lack of money,
about shame.

335
00:45:23,209 --> 00:45:25,084
I know the bad luck
with your mother...

336
00:45:25,126 --> 00:45:27,043
and the tragedies she's lived.

337
00:45:27,085 --> 00:45:29,709
How do you know?

338
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,794
Through the servants.

339
00:45:31,878 --> 00:45:33,087
Through my driver.

340
00:45:34,211 --> 00:45:36,711
You know everything
through the servants.

341
00:45:40,088 --> 00:45:42,672
I know about
your elder brother, too.

342
00:45:42,713 --> 00:45:47,173
I met him in the opium dens
along the riverside.

343
00:45:47,215 --> 00:45:49,006
He smokes too much.

344
00:45:50,216 --> 00:45:52,715
Much too much.

345
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,716
The whites don't know
how to smoke.

346
00:45:55,926 --> 00:45:57,384
He's an animal.

347
00:45:57,384 --> 00:45:59,217
He scares me.

348
00:46:00,718 --> 00:46:03,718
He steals from my mother
to go smoke.

349
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,094
He steals
from the servants.

350
00:46:06,137 --> 00:46:08,303
My mother never
says anything.

351
00:46:08,345 --> 00:46:09,553
He's her favorite.

352
00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:15,138
Since my father died,
there's no money in the house.

353
00:46:16,973 --> 00:46:18,889
My mother
lost everything here.

354
00:46:20,723 --> 00:46:22,598
She made all
the wrong choices.

355
00:46:24,808 --> 00:46:26,558
So how do you manage?

356
00:46:28,642 --> 00:46:31,517
We do the best we can.

357
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,101
We're shameless.

358
00:46:34,643 --> 00:46:37,144
We do the best we can.

359
00:46:47,479 --> 00:46:51,439
Did you come here
because I've got money?

360
00:46:51,481 --> 00:46:52,981
I don't know.

361
00:46:56,149 --> 00:46:58,648
I came because I liked you.

362
00:47:01,066 --> 00:47:03,774
Would you like me
if I were poor?

363
00:47:05,693 --> 00:47:08,151
I like you the way you are...

364
00:47:08,151 --> 00:47:09,651
with your money.

365
00:47:45,493 --> 00:47:46,994
I want to...

366
00:47:46,994 --> 00:47:49,161
take you away.

367
00:47:49,203 --> 00:47:50,327
I'd like
to take you away...

368
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:52,453
leave with you.

369
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:54,328
I can't leave
without my mother yet.

370
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,955
I'm too little.

371
00:47:56,996 --> 00:47:59,329
I can't leave my mother
nor my little brother.

372
00:47:59,372 --> 00:48:00,622
Not yet.

373
00:48:15,001 --> 00:48:18,001
I had asked him to do it
again and again.

374
00:48:18,044 --> 00:48:20,793
To do it to me.

375
00:48:20,836 --> 00:48:23,085
He had done it.

376
00:48:23,128 --> 00:48:28,254
He had done it
in the unctuousness of blood.

377
00:48:28,296 --> 00:48:31,504
I think he's used to it.

378
00:48:31,546 --> 00:48:33,504
This is what he does
in life--

379
00:48:33,547 --> 00:48:36,131
Love. Nothing else.

380
00:48:36,174 --> 00:48:37,798
I'm very lucky.

381
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:42,966
Obviously, it's as if it were
a profession he'd have.

382
00:48:43,009 --> 00:48:45,425
He's on me...

383
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:48,425
he engulfs himself again.

384
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:51,925
We stay like that, nailed...

385
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:55,260
moaning in the clamor
of the town.

386
00:49:11,015 --> 00:49:13,474
You see...

387
00:49:13,515 --> 00:49:16,765
you'll remember this afternoon
all your life...

388
00:49:17,975 --> 00:49:20,767
even if you've
forgotten my face...

389
00:49:20,808 --> 00:49:22,267
my name:

390
00:49:26,393 --> 00:49:28,894
Do you think
I'll remember the room?

391
00:49:30,853 --> 00:49:32,895
Take a good look at it.

392
00:49:41,397 --> 00:49:42,938
It's like anywhere.

393
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:46,564
That's it.

394
00:49:46,607 --> 00:49:49,066
It's like always.

395
00:50:23,782 --> 00:50:25,907
I wonder
how I found the strength...

396
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:30,201
to go against the forbidden
with this calm...

397
00:50:30,242 --> 00:50:32,201
this determination...

398
00:50:32,243 --> 00:50:35,160
how I succeeded
in going all the way...

399
00:50:35,203 --> 00:50:37,369
to the end of the idea.

400
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,410
How could I have taken
so much pleasure...

401
00:50:40,453 --> 00:50:43,787
for me alone
with this unknown man?

402
00:51:32,049 --> 00:51:33,466
My mother...

403
00:51:33,508 --> 00:51:36,466
she'll kill me
if she finds out the truth.

404
00:51:36,509 --> 00:51:38,467
My brother, he'd kill you.

405
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:40,468
Imagine...

406
00:51:40,509 --> 00:51:42,260
with a Chinaman.

407
00:51:47,386 --> 00:51:49,053
Since I've been little...

408
00:51:49,136 --> 00:51:52,053
she tells me that
here in the colonies...

409
00:51:52,137 --> 00:51:54,555
a girl that isn't
a virgin anymore...

410
00:51:54,638 --> 00:51:56,555
can no longer
find a husband.

411
00:51:56,639 --> 00:51:58,514
Do you think that's true?

412
00:51:58,557 --> 00:52:01,681
Yes. Your mother's right.

413
00:52:01,722 --> 00:52:03,889
It's no longer possible
after that--

414
00:52:03,932 --> 00:52:06,974
that dishonor.

415
00:52:07,016 --> 00:52:08,474
For instance...

416
00:52:08,516 --> 00:52:10,975
if I wanted to marry you...

417
00:52:11,017 --> 00:52:13,851
well, it would
not be allowed.

418
00:52:13,893 --> 00:52:16,852
We can't tolerate
the idea of that.

419
00:52:16,894 --> 00:52:18,018
I'm Chinese.

420
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:19,394
I'm sorry.

421
00:52:19,394 --> 00:52:22,352
Now that you've
done that with me...

422
00:52:22,395 --> 00:52:24,894
marriage between us
would be impossible.

423
00:52:26,646 --> 00:52:29,397
Well, then,
it's for the best, then.

424
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:32,396
Chinese--I don't like
Chinese very much.

425
00:53:12,782 --> 00:53:13,949
Hey.

426
00:53:15,908 --> 00:53:17,033
Hey.

427
00:53:18,408 --> 00:53:19,825
Can I come into your bed?

428
00:53:19,868 --> 00:53:22,242
No, not now.

429
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,743
I'll tell you
about it tomorrow.

430
00:53:39,663 --> 00:53:41,872
What's wrong?
What's the matter?

431
00:54:08,254 --> 00:54:10,588
What's she doing
in that new car there?

432
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:22,673
Hello.

433
00:54:55,849 --> 00:54:57,849
Wait. Wait.

434
00:58:09,397 --> 00:58:12,397
Don't be bashful.
It's a wonderful report.

435
00:58:20,774 --> 00:58:24,733
She's the sole heiress,
and I'm the sole heir.

436
00:58:24,775 --> 00:58:26,733
The date
has been set for years.

437
00:58:26,776 --> 00:58:28,943
That's another reason
I came back from France.

438
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:36,944
-You love her?
-No.

439
00:58:37,945 --> 00:58:40,404
I don't know her.

440
00:58:40,446 --> 00:58:41,572
For us...

441
00:58:41,613 --> 00:58:44,280
marriages are arranged
by the families.

442
00:58:44,322 --> 00:58:47,948
We know that a future
together is unthinkable...

443
00:58:47,948 --> 00:58:49,781
so we speak of the future...

444
00:58:49,864 --> 00:58:51,614
in a casual manner...

445
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:54,949
without any involvement,
detached.

446
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:56,783
And the two families
got together...

447
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,283
to hide their wealth away.

448
00:58:59,617 --> 00:59:02,866
It's so much the customs
of ancient...

449
00:59:02,909 --> 00:59:04,326
or modern China.

450
00:59:05,952 --> 00:59:09,452
We don't think we could do
anything any other way.

451
00:59:12,787 --> 00:59:14,245
He's never had a job.

452
00:59:14,287 --> 00:59:16,745
He says that if he was poor...

453
00:59:16,788 --> 00:59:18,454
it would be terrible.

454
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:20,538
He'd be much
too lazy to work.

455
00:59:20,581 --> 00:59:23,581
It's opium that
takes away the strength.

456
00:59:23,623 --> 00:59:24,748
No.

457
00:59:24,789 --> 00:59:27,747
It's wealth that takes
his strength away.

458
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:29,416
He does nothing.

459
00:59:29,458 --> 00:59:30,583
Nothing.

460
00:59:30,624 --> 00:59:32,125
Only love.

461
00:59:33,959 --> 00:59:35,417
But it's funny...

462
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:38,126
because that's the way
I desire him.

463
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,588
Do you still love me?

464
01:00:38,183 --> 01:00:39,932
We are lovers.

465
01:00:39,975 --> 01:00:43,601
Every day we go back
to the bachelor's room.

466
01:00:43,642 --> 01:00:45,434
We can't stop loving.

467
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:48,102
This takes place...

468
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:52,102
in the sleazy district
of Cholon every evening.

469
01:00:52,144 --> 01:00:53,728
Every evening...

470
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:56,729
the little one comes
to receive the pleasure...

471
01:00:56,771 --> 01:01:00,564
that makes one scream
from this dark man...

472
01:01:00,606 --> 01:01:02,606
this man from Cholon...

473
01:01:02,646 --> 01:01:04,439
from China.

474
01:04:01,024 --> 01:04:02,190
Hi, Mom.

475
01:04:12,944 --> 01:04:14,111
Hi, Paul.

476
01:04:39,449 --> 01:04:43,867
Now and then I go back
to the house in Sa-Dec...

477
01:04:43,952 --> 01:04:46,910
to the horror
of the house in Sa-Dec.

478
01:04:47,911 --> 01:04:49,369
It's an unbearable place.

479
01:04:49,411 --> 01:04:51,452
It's close to death...

480
01:04:51,495 --> 01:04:52,995
a place of violence...

481
01:04:53,036 --> 01:04:56,370
of pain, of despair,
of dishonor.

482
01:04:57,955 --> 01:04:59,913
I forbid you
to slam doors!

483
01:04:59,955 --> 01:05:01,455
Do you hear me?

484
01:05:03,664 --> 01:05:05,455
Who drove you back
from Saigon?

485
01:05:05,498 --> 01:05:07,873
I told you. A friend.
He lives in Vinh Long.

486
01:05:07,958 --> 01:05:09,541
He offered to drop me off
on his way through.

487
01:05:09,624 --> 01:05:11,041
He's a friend! That's all.

488
01:05:11,124 --> 01:05:12,541
Who in Vinh Long?

489
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:14,625
You wouldn't know him.

490
01:05:14,709 --> 01:05:16,834
He just got back from Paris.

491
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:18,834
A friend.
A rich friend.

492
01:05:18,876 --> 01:05:22,002
Not everybody's lucky
enough to be poor.

493
01:05:22,044 --> 01:05:24,336
And this...

494
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:25,752
what's this?

495
01:05:25,795 --> 01:05:28,087
A piece of blue paper.

496
01:05:28,129 --> 01:05:30,212
It's a telegram
from the boardinghouse.

497
01:05:30,255 --> 01:05:32,421
Where did you sleep
Tuesday and Wednesday?

498
01:05:32,463 --> 01:05:33,964
Where did I sleep
Tuesday and Wednesday?

499
01:05:34,047 --> 01:05:35,297
Not at
the boardinghouse.

500
01:05:35,338 --> 01:05:37,380
The fans were out of order.

501
01:05:37,464 --> 01:05:39,381
I slept with my friend
from Vinh Long.

502
01:05:39,465 --> 01:05:41,382
Is that what
you want me to say?

503
01:05:41,465 --> 01:05:43,340
Hit her, Mom.

504
01:05:43,383 --> 01:05:44,882
Don't let her
get away with it.

505
01:05:44,966 --> 01:05:46,632
But it's in
this family's dryness...

506
01:05:46,633 --> 01:05:49,092
in its incredible
harshness...

507
01:05:49,134 --> 01:05:52,592
that I am the most deeply
assured of myself...

508
01:05:52,634 --> 01:05:56,010
in the deepest of
my essential certainties.

509
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:58,552
Our common history
of ruin and shame...

510
01:05:58,595 --> 01:06:01,761
of love and hate,
is in my flesh.

511
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,845
Your daughter
looks like a whore.

512
01:06:05,888 --> 01:06:07,804
Hey, dummy,
stop that shooting!

513
01:06:07,847 --> 01:06:10,306
I am still in this family.

514
01:06:10,347 --> 01:06:12,306
This is, barring
all other places...

515
01:06:12,348 --> 01:06:13,723
where I live.

516
01:06:13,806 --> 01:06:15,223
That was your dress, Mom.

517
01:06:15,308 --> 01:06:16,807
The shoes, you
bought them for me.

518
01:06:16,891 --> 01:06:18,849
I've been wearing
them for months.

519
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:22,349
They were on sale, remember?
Final reductions.

520
01:06:22,392 --> 01:06:24,642
You do it on purpose.

521
01:06:24,685 --> 01:06:27,059
See what a state I'm in
because of you?

522
01:06:27,101 --> 01:06:29,351
It's as though
it makes you happy.

523
01:06:33,603 --> 01:06:35,353
If you don't
trust me anymore...

524
01:06:35,396 --> 01:06:37,812
just take me out
of the boardinghouse.

525
01:06:39,813 --> 01:06:42,813
Besides, I'm not the one
who asked to be all alone...

526
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:45,522
all year long in Saigon.

527
01:06:45,564 --> 01:06:48,355
The mother can be very,
very happy sometimes...

528
01:06:48,398 --> 01:06:49,857
the time to forget.

529
01:06:49,899 --> 01:06:51,857
That of washing the house...

530
01:06:51,899 --> 01:06:54,857
may suffice
for my mother's happiness.

531
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:57,774
She plays the piano,
she cleans, she laughs...

532
01:06:57,817 --> 01:06:59,901
and everyone thinks...

533
01:06:59,943 --> 01:07:03,110
that one can be happy
in this gutted house...

534
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:05,111
that suddenly
becomes a swamp...

535
01:07:05,153 --> 01:07:06,861
a field alongside a river...

536
01:07:06,904 --> 01:07:09,820
a ford, a beach.

537
01:08:40,009 --> 01:08:42,175
My respects, madame.

538
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:43,885
My mother...

539
01:08:45,219 --> 01:08:46,886
my brother Pierre...

540
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:50,512
and my brother Paul.

541
01:08:57,554 --> 01:08:59,638
On Saturday night
they are busy.

542
01:09:01,806 --> 01:09:03,972
Will you be having
a cocktail, sir?

543
01:09:04,015 --> 01:09:07,015
Yes. Three Martel-Perriers
and a bottle of rice wine.

544
01:09:20,811 --> 01:09:23,269
We left China when Sun Yat-sen
decreed the republic...

545
01:09:23,312 --> 01:09:26,311
and my father just sold
all his lands...

546
01:09:26,354 --> 01:09:27,813
to the Japanese...

547
01:09:27,854 --> 01:09:29,813
who had already
taken over Manchuria--

548
01:09:29,855 --> 01:09:32,563
all the houses, jewels,
and everything...

549
01:09:32,605 --> 01:09:36,106
to go down
towards the south.

550
01:09:37,399 --> 01:09:38,856
And my mother...

551
01:09:38,898 --> 01:09:40,856
she'd just lie in the road...

552
01:09:40,899 --> 01:09:43,690
and she can't
go on anymore:

553
01:09:43,733 --> 01:09:46,858
The mother and the brothers
mustn't know a thing.

554
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:48,858
It is set by principle...

555
01:09:48,901 --> 01:09:50,359
that he's at my feet...

556
01:09:50,401 --> 01:09:52,859
that I'm with him
for the money...

557
01:09:52,902 --> 01:09:54,860
that I can't love him.

558
01:09:54,903 --> 01:09:57,611
This because he's Chinese,
because he's not white.

559
01:09:57,653 --> 01:10:01,111
My brothers devour and
don't speak a word to him.

560
01:10:01,153 --> 01:10:04,487
I don't speak a word
to him, either.

561
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:07,987
In my family's presence,
he ceases to be my lover.

562
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:09,488
He doesn't cease to exist...

563
01:10:09,531 --> 01:10:11,489
but he's nothing
to me anymore.

564
01:10:11,531 --> 01:10:13,989
He becomes
a burned-out place...

565
01:10:14,032 --> 01:10:15,490
an unacceptable scandal...

566
01:10:15,533 --> 01:10:20,158
a reason to be ashamed of,
that has to be hidden.

567
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:35,619
So, what are we
waiting for?

568
01:10:35,662 --> 01:10:38,412
I'd like to have a drink
at La Cascade.

569
01:10:38,454 --> 01:10:40,121
Your bill, sir.

570
01:10:40,163 --> 01:10:41,706
We'd like to go
to La Cascade...

571
01:10:41,747 --> 01:10:43,205
to drink and dance.

572
01:11:41,137 --> 01:11:42,594
What makes you laugh...

573
01:11:42,637 --> 01:11:45,096
that I'm dancing
with your sister?

574
01:11:45,138 --> 01:11:46,096
I'm sorry.

575
01:11:46,139 --> 01:11:47,596
You're so badly paired.

576
01:11:47,638 --> 01:11:49,097
Don't pay attention, sir.

577
01:11:49,139 --> 01:11:51,097
He's drunk, that's all.

578
01:11:51,139 --> 01:11:52,097
What?

579
01:11:52,139 --> 01:11:54,180
Can't I laugh or what?

580
01:11:56,558 --> 01:11:59,349
Do you want to fight?

581
01:11:59,391 --> 01:12:01,182
Take care, little buddy.

582
01:12:01,225 --> 01:12:04,309
It'd take two of you
to do the job.

583
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,892
Oh, no.

584
01:12:05,934 --> 01:12:08,517
A lot more than that.

585
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,518
Four of me, you mean.

586
01:12:11,561 --> 01:12:15,062
You have no idea
how weak I am.

587
01:13:03,490 --> 01:13:05,824
We should leave.

588
01:13:05,866 --> 01:13:07,907
Forgive him, sir.

589
01:13:07,949 --> 01:13:09,824
Forgive us.

590
01:13:09,867 --> 01:13:13,242
I've not brought
my children up well.

591
01:13:13,285 --> 01:13:15,951
I'm paying for it.

592
01:13:18,744 --> 01:13:21,952
I'm the one who's
punished the most.

593
01:16:02,368 --> 01:16:05,325
How much
is what we did worth?

594
01:16:11,703 --> 01:16:14,328
In a brothel,
how much does it cost...

595
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:17,328
to do what you just did
to me?

596
01:16:19,372 --> 01:16:22,372
How much do you need?

597
01:16:22,373 --> 01:16:25,039
My mother needs
500 piasters.

598
01:17:02,549 --> 01:17:05,257
I've got your money.

599
01:17:05,299 --> 01:17:06,508
Here.

600
01:17:08,384 --> 01:17:10,550
Where's her office?

601
01:17:10,591 --> 01:17:12,092
It's over there.

602
01:17:15,052 --> 01:17:17,719
You see, we have to let her...

603
01:17:17,803 --> 01:17:19,720
go free in the evening...

604
01:17:19,803 --> 01:17:22,177
not tell her what time
to be in.

605
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:23,721
We mustn't force her...

606
01:17:23,804 --> 01:17:26,220
to go on trips
with the boarders, either.

607
01:17:26,304 --> 01:17:29,722
She's always been a free child.
Otherwise, she'd run away.

608
01:17:30,805 --> 01:17:34,222
Even I can't do
a thing about that.

609
01:17:34,306 --> 01:17:37,223
She's always worked
very well in school...

610
01:17:37,307 --> 01:17:38,890
even being so free.

611
01:17:38,975 --> 01:17:42,684
The headmistress accepted
because I'm white...

612
01:17:42,726 --> 01:17:45,267
and that for the
boardinghouse's reputation...

613
01:17:45,308 --> 01:17:48,308
amongst all the half-castes
there must be a few whites.

614
01:17:48,351 --> 01:17:50,851
She let me live
in the boardinghouse...

615
01:17:50,852 --> 01:17:52,436
as if it were a hotel.

616
01:17:53,811 --> 01:17:55,769
Other than
my French teacher...

617
01:17:55,811 --> 01:17:58,186
nobody speaks to me
at school.

618
01:17:58,187 --> 01:18:01,271
It's because of you.

619
01:18:01,313 --> 01:18:02,688
That's your imagination.

620
01:18:02,771 --> 01:18:04,188
No.

621
01:18:04,189 --> 01:18:06,689
There have been some
complaints from families.

622
01:18:06,690 --> 01:18:08,690
They say I'm a slut...

623
01:18:08,732 --> 01:18:11,189
and goes
to the shady part of town...

624
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:13,691
to have her body fondled
by a Chinaman.

625
01:18:13,692 --> 01:18:14,816
It's nothing.

626
01:18:18,692 --> 01:18:20,692
That's true. It's nothing.

627
01:18:37,155 --> 01:18:39,196
Ooh! It touched her.
It's nasty.

628
01:18:40,197 --> 01:18:43,531
Ooh! She sleeps
with a Chinaman.

629
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:15,165
One day you're going
to go back to France.

630
01:19:15,206 --> 01:19:16,873
I can't take that.

631
01:19:24,584 --> 01:19:27,417
When are you going
back to France?

632
01:19:27,501 --> 01:19:29,751
At the end
of the school year...

633
01:19:29,834 --> 01:19:31,209
but it's not sure.

634
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:33,918
My mother has a lot of
difficulty in leaving here.

635
01:19:51,048 --> 01:19:53,506
The stone belonged
to my mother.

636
01:19:53,549 --> 01:19:55,715
Take it.

637
01:23:01,886 --> 01:23:04,387
And I said to him
that it's too new...

638
01:23:04,429 --> 01:23:06,388
it's too strong...

639
01:23:06,429 --> 01:23:10,013
and I said
to him that...

640
01:23:10,055 --> 01:23:14,514
it is horrid to take you
away from my body.

641
01:23:14,557 --> 01:23:18,014
I--I said to him
that he--my father--

642
01:23:18,057 --> 01:23:22,016
he--he should know
what it is...

643
01:23:22,058 --> 01:23:26,226
a love like this--
so strong...

644
01:23:26,268 --> 01:23:29,475
that it never happens
again in a lifetime--

645
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:30,726
never:

646
01:23:40,563 --> 01:23:43,479
He wants
this marriage with...

647
01:23:43,564 --> 01:23:46,063
this young girl
I've never seen.

648
01:23:50,232 --> 01:23:53,983
He shows no mercy for me.

649
01:23:54,066 --> 01:23:56,399
He shows none for anyone.

650
01:23:58,442 --> 01:23:59,900
And you?

651
01:23:59,943 --> 01:24:02,068
Do you want this marriage?

652
01:24:05,444 --> 01:24:07,569
The question
is not of wanting...

653
01:24:07,570 --> 01:24:09,570
or not wanting.

654
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:24,698
I'm nothing without
my father's wealth.

655
01:24:27,450 --> 01:24:29,742
He told me...

656
01:24:31,950 --> 01:24:34,576
"I'd rather see you dead...

657
01:24:34,577 --> 01:24:37,659
than know you were
with that white girl."

658
01:24:37,743 --> 01:24:39,410
But he's right.

659
01:24:39,453 --> 01:24:41,910
He's right because
anyhow I'll leave...

660
01:24:41,953 --> 01:24:44,578
and I have no love for you.

661
01:25:03,125 --> 01:25:04,458
You see.

662
01:25:04,541 --> 01:25:05,750
It's here.

663
01:25:07,209 --> 01:25:09,917
My mother,
when I was little...

664
01:25:09,918 --> 01:25:12,085
wanted to erect a dam...

665
01:25:12,085 --> 01:25:14,918
to protect
her good-growing land.

666
01:25:14,919 --> 01:25:17,586
She wanted
to become rich for us.

667
01:25:20,254 --> 01:25:21,421
She put all the savings...

668
01:25:21,463 --> 01:25:23,754
left after my
father's death into it.

669
01:25:26,922 --> 01:25:29,422
People lied to her.

670
01:25:29,422 --> 01:25:32,422
The land registrar agents
sold her flood lands...

671
01:25:32,423 --> 01:25:34,923
just to earn their premiums.

672
01:25:34,924 --> 01:25:37,424
Saltwater
covered everything.

673
01:25:37,425 --> 01:25:40,592
She lost everything
here--everything.

674
01:25:40,592 --> 01:25:42,425
It took her years...

675
01:25:42,426 --> 01:25:43,925
to believe
that it was possible...

676
01:25:43,925 --> 01:25:46,426
for people to steal
all her savings...

677
01:25:46,427 --> 01:25:48,634
and then never
acknowledge her again...

678
01:25:48,677 --> 01:25:49,927
to throw her out.

679
01:25:49,927 --> 01:25:52,927
She would scream.
She had fits.

680
01:25:52,928 --> 01:25:54,595
People started to say
that she was crazy...

681
01:25:54,637 --> 01:25:56,138
to not believe
what she said...

682
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:58,304
about her money anymore...

683
01:25:58,347 --> 01:26:00,847
to say
that she was lying.

684
01:26:02,264 --> 01:26:05,807
We never saw another
white person for years.

685
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:09,307
The whites
were ashamed of us.

686
01:26:09,391 --> 01:26:11,807
She had to give
everything up.

687
01:26:11,891 --> 01:26:13,308
The upper rice paddy--

688
01:26:13,392 --> 01:26:15,309
she gave it
to the servants...

689
01:26:15,392 --> 01:26:18,475
along with the bungalow
and all the furniture.

690
01:26:24,394 --> 01:26:25,811
We used to sit here...

691
01:26:25,895 --> 01:26:28,311
with my mother
and my little brother...

692
01:26:28,395 --> 01:26:31,312
and we'd watch
the sky of Siam...

693
01:26:31,396 --> 01:26:33,729
over there
behind the mountains.

694
01:26:45,358 --> 01:26:47,524
You feel cold?

695
01:26:47,609 --> 01:26:49,025
A little.

696
01:27:20,617 --> 01:27:22,783
That evening I know it.

697
01:27:22,784 --> 01:27:25,784
I know only that...

698
01:27:25,785 --> 01:27:30,244
later I will write
my mother's life--

699
01:27:30,285 --> 01:27:35,245
how she was killed
by the land registrar agents...

700
01:27:35,286 --> 01:27:37,787
robbed by
the government officials.

701
01:27:39,664 --> 01:27:41,746
To write--

702
01:27:41,788 --> 01:27:44,788
that's what I see
beyond the moment...

703
01:27:44,789 --> 01:27:46,289
in that great desert...

704
01:27:46,289 --> 01:27:48,789
under the features of which...

705
01:27:48,790 --> 01:27:51,915
I see the extent of my life.

706
01:28:11,129 --> 01:28:13,255
Is she beautiful?

707
01:28:13,255 --> 01:28:14,420
She's rich.

708
01:28:18,464 --> 01:28:21,756
The family chose her
also because of that.

709
01:28:23,757 --> 01:28:26,839
She's covered with gold...

710
01:28:26,924 --> 01:28:28,757
jade...

711
01:28:28,758 --> 01:28:30,758
and diamonds.

712
01:28:36,261 --> 01:28:39,803
Did you ever sleep
with a white girl before me?

713
01:28:45,303 --> 01:28:47,554
In Paris, of course.

714
01:28:49,764 --> 01:28:52,722
Here, no.

715
01:28:52,764 --> 01:28:54,139
Why?

716
01:28:56,765 --> 01:28:58,890
Here...

717
01:28:58,932 --> 01:29:01,640
other than
French prostitutes...

718
01:29:01,683 --> 01:29:04,641
it's impossible
to have white women.

719
01:29:06,685 --> 01:29:08,852
Totally impossible.

720
01:29:41,192 --> 01:29:44,484
I want you to say it
to me once.

721
01:29:47,443 --> 01:29:51,862
You came here so that
I'd give you money.

722
01:29:53,696 --> 01:29:57,196
I came here so that
you'd give me money.

723
01:30:02,823 --> 01:30:04,698
Repeat after me.

724
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:10,158
I was thinking about money...

725
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,992
and only about money...

726
01:30:13,034 --> 01:30:16,660
from the moment
I saw you on the ferry.

727
01:30:16,702 --> 01:30:18,660
I was thinking about money...

728
01:30:18,702 --> 01:30:20,160
and only about money...

729
01:30:20,202 --> 01:30:23,704
since the moment
I saw you on the ferry.

730
01:30:27,704 --> 01:30:29,620
You're a whore.

731
01:30:30,872 --> 01:30:32,788
You're a whore.

732
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:40,039
I don't find that disgusting.

733
01:30:40,124 --> 01:30:42,290
On the contrary...

734
01:31:05,171 --> 01:31:06,629
You know...

735
01:31:09,673 --> 01:31:11,339
before you...

736
01:31:12,923 --> 01:31:15,549
I knew nothing
about suffering.

737
01:31:20,176 --> 01:31:21,967
I would love to...

738
01:31:24,177 --> 01:31:27,634
I would love to take you...

739
01:31:27,677 --> 01:31:30,135
but I'm without strength.

740
01:31:35,637 --> 01:31:38,345
I'm without
any strength at all.

741
01:31:43,555 --> 01:31:45,056
I'm dead.

742
01:31:48,682 --> 01:31:51,141
I have no desire for you.

743
01:32:01,311 --> 01:32:04,519
My body no longer wants
the one who doesn't love.

744
01:33:17,620 --> 01:33:20,162
Do you know
what that's worth?

745
01:33:20,205 --> 01:33:22,080
You want
to have us believe...

746
01:33:22,122 --> 01:33:24,622
he just gave it to you
for your pretty face?

747
01:33:27,998 --> 01:33:29,831
Why did he give you
such a diamond?

748
01:33:29,874 --> 01:33:32,582
Why? Because he's rich.

749
01:33:32,625 --> 01:33:34,916
Your daughter's whoring.

750
01:33:38,875 --> 01:33:40,334
Take it! Sell it!

751
01:33:40,377 --> 01:33:42,335
See if I care
about that ring!

752
01:33:42,377 --> 01:33:44,335
You slept with him.
I'm sure of it.

753
01:33:44,377 --> 01:33:45,585
Just take a look at her.

754
01:33:45,627 --> 01:33:47,169
She's a disgrace.

755
01:33:47,212 --> 01:33:48,170
What?

756
01:33:48,211 --> 01:33:49,670
You've got
to do something, Mum.

757
01:33:49,712 --> 01:33:53,087
What are you saying?
Me with a Chinaman?

758
01:33:53,129 --> 01:33:55,088
Nothing happened--
nothing--

759
01:33:55,129 --> 01:33:56,837
not even a kiss.

760
01:34:03,465 --> 01:34:06,215
It smells of Chinese.

761
01:34:09,050 --> 01:34:11,050
You slept with him.

762
01:34:13,217 --> 01:34:14,550
Say it.

763
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:18,718
Say it.

764
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:20,552
Say it!

765
01:34:20,552 --> 01:34:22,802
You're going to say it,
you bitch!

766
01:34:22,844 --> 01:34:24,345
You filthy bitch!

767
01:34:24,387 --> 01:34:27,512
You slept with a Chink.
Did you like it? Huh?

768
01:34:27,553 --> 01:34:29,512
Pierre, stop!

769
01:34:29,554 --> 01:34:33,181
Stop it, I say! Stop it!
You're going to kill her!

770
01:34:33,223 --> 01:34:35,973
Stop it! Stop it,
for god's sake!

771
01:34:36,015 --> 01:34:37,473
You're killing her, Pierre!

772
01:34:37,515 --> 01:34:38,765
Stop it!

773
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:03,301
I thought my child
wouldn't come anymore.

774
01:37:03,301 --> 01:37:05,384
I took a rickshaw.

775
01:37:09,428 --> 01:37:11,094
Did you smoke a lot?

776
01:37:12,803 --> 01:37:14,304
That's all I do.

777
01:37:16,596 --> 01:37:18,554
I have no desire left.

778
01:37:19,805 --> 01:37:21,805
I have no love left.

779
01:37:23,806 --> 01:37:25,473
It's wonderful.

780
01:37:25,473 --> 01:37:29,806
It's as though
we'd never met...

781
01:37:29,849 --> 01:37:33,601
or as though
you left months ago.

782
01:37:49,854 --> 01:37:51,895
When are you
getting married?

783
01:37:56,522 --> 01:37:58,688
Next Friday...

784
01:37:58,731 --> 01:38:01,481
and leaving...

785
01:38:01,565 --> 01:38:05,566
on the Alexandre Dumas
the 12th.

786
01:38:08,233 --> 01:38:10,400
Look at me.

787
01:38:10,442 --> 01:38:15,901
I'm going to die
of love for you.

788
01:38:20,986 --> 01:38:22,445
After your marriage...

789
01:38:22,488 --> 01:38:24,446
we'll meet here one time--

790
01:38:24,487 --> 01:38:25,445
just once.

791
01:38:25,488 --> 01:38:27,780
You remember?

792
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:29,488
You promised me.

793
01:40:48,272 --> 01:40:51,647
You're also selling
the rosewood table?

794
01:40:51,648 --> 01:40:53,314
Yes.

795
01:40:53,399 --> 01:40:55,816
I'm leaving everything.

796
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:58,400
It's all finished here.

797
01:41:04,110 --> 01:41:07,944
The only thing I'll miss
are the metal beds.

798
01:41:07,986 --> 01:41:11,027
In France,
the beds are too soft.

799
01:41:16,154 --> 01:41:19,112
What's that hat?

800
01:41:19,154 --> 01:41:22,656
Mom, I've been
wearing it for months.

801
01:41:24,156 --> 01:41:27,323
-Did I buy that for you?
-Who else?

802
01:41:27,366 --> 01:41:29,824
Some days we can make you
buy anything we want.

803
01:41:29,824 --> 01:41:32,324
I forgot.

804
01:41:36,159 --> 01:41:38,159
You know...

805
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:40,159
I wasn't like you.

806
01:41:42,953 --> 01:41:46,829
I didn't study
as easily as you do...

807
01:41:46,829 --> 01:41:48,995
and l...

808
01:41:53,663 --> 01:41:55,955
I was very serious...

809
01:41:58,248 --> 01:42:01,455
for so long--too long.

810
01:42:05,165 --> 01:42:07,000
That's how
I lost the feeling...

811
01:42:07,083 --> 01:42:09,125
of my own pleasure.

812
01:42:13,835 --> 01:42:16,626
He did a really
good thing, truly.

813
01:42:16,669 --> 01:42:18,627
Who did a good thing?

814
01:42:18,669 --> 01:42:20,169
Your friend--

815
01:42:20,212 --> 01:42:22,378
your Chinese friend.

816
01:42:22,461 --> 01:42:24,170
He paid off
your brother's debts...

817
01:42:24,171 --> 01:42:26,671
at the opium den.

818
01:42:26,672 --> 01:42:28,630
He also paid for the trip.

819
01:42:28,672 --> 01:42:30,338
He was wonderful--

820
01:42:30,381 --> 01:42:32,506
very discreet, too.

821
01:42:32,548 --> 01:42:35,131
I had underestimated him.

822
01:42:35,173 --> 01:42:37,674
I'm sorry about that.

823
01:42:42,175 --> 01:42:45,134
Do you only see him
for the money?

824
01:42:48,177 --> 01:42:49,635
Yes.

825
01:46:55,363 --> 01:46:58,863
It was when the boat
uttered its first farewell...

826
01:46:58,863 --> 01:47:01,863
and the gangway
had been hauled up...

827
01:47:01,863 --> 01:47:04,863
and the tugs
had started to tow it...

828
01:47:04,864 --> 01:47:07,864
to draw it away
from the land...

829
01:47:07,865 --> 01:47:09,365
that she had wept.

830
01:47:10,866 --> 01:47:13,866
She'd done it
without showing her tears...

831
01:47:13,867 --> 01:47:17,368
without showing her mother
or her little brother...

832
01:47:17,368 --> 01:47:19,368
that she was sad...

833
01:47:19,368 --> 01:47:20,867
without showing anything...

834
01:47:20,868 --> 01:47:24,244
as was the custom
between them.

835
01:48:13,215 --> 01:48:16,257
He was there.

836
01:48:16,340 --> 01:48:19,215
That was him
in the back--

837
01:48:19,258 --> 01:48:22,258
that scarcely visible shape...

838
01:48:22,341 --> 01:48:26,967
that made no movement,
crushed.

839
01:48:33,470 --> 01:48:35,470
She was leaning
on the railing...

840
01:48:35,553 --> 01:48:38,469
like the first time
on the ferry.

841
01:48:38,554 --> 01:48:40,762
She knew
he was watching her.

842
01:48:40,805 --> 01:48:43,221
She was watching him, too.

843
01:49:05,228 --> 01:49:08,352
She couldn't see him anymore,
but she still looked...

844
01:49:08,395 --> 01:49:11,353
towards the shape
of the black car.

845
01:49:21,398 --> 01:49:24,356
In the end,
she didn't see it anymore.

846
01:49:24,399 --> 01:49:26,732
The harbor had faded away...

847
01:49:26,733 --> 01:49:28,733
and then the land.

848
01:49:46,905 --> 01:49:48,071
One night...

849
01:49:48,113 --> 01:49:51,071
during the crossing
of the Indian Ocean...

850
01:49:51,114 --> 01:49:53,739
in the main room
on the big deck...

851
01:49:53,740 --> 01:49:56,239
there had been
a sudden burst...

852
01:49:56,239 --> 01:49:58,239
of a waltz by Chopin.

853
01:50:02,742 --> 01:50:04,741
There wasn't
a breath of wind...

854
01:50:04,742 --> 01:50:06,367
and that night...

855
01:50:06,409 --> 01:50:10,243
the music had spread
all over the black liner...

856
01:50:10,243 --> 01:50:12,243
Like an injunction
from heaven...

857
01:50:12,244 --> 01:50:13,744
related to something unknown...

858
01:50:13,744 --> 01:50:15,744
Like an order from God...

859
01:50:15,745 --> 01:50:18,244
whose meaning
was inscrutable.

860
01:50:40,417 --> 01:50:41,918
She had wept...

861
01:50:41,918 --> 01:50:45,752
because she had thought
of that man from Cholon--

862
01:50:45,752 --> 01:50:47,210
her lover--

863
01:50:47,252 --> 01:50:49,211
and suddenly
she wasn't sure...

864
01:50:49,252 --> 01:50:50,711
of not having loved him...

865
01:50:50,754 --> 01:50:52,753
with a love
she hadn't seen...

866
01:50:52,753 --> 01:50:55,378
because it had lost itself
in the story...

867
01:50:55,421 --> 01:50:57,379
Like water in the sand...

868
01:50:57,422 --> 01:51:00,379
and that she was
rediscovering it now...

869
01:51:00,422 --> 01:51:04,882
in this moment of music
flung across the sea.

870
01:51:28,387 --> 01:51:30,262
Years after the war...

871
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:32,596
after the marriages,
the children...

872
01:51:32,597 --> 01:51:34,680
the divorces, the books...

873
01:51:34,722 --> 01:51:37,680
he had come to Paris
with his wife.

874
01:51:37,723 --> 01:51:39,389
He had phoned her.

875
01:51:41,724 --> 01:51:43,183
He was intimidated.

876
01:51:43,225 --> 01:51:45,225
His voice trembled...

877
01:51:45,267 --> 01:51:46,725
and with the trembling...

878
01:51:46,767 --> 01:51:50,267
it had found
the accent of China again.

879
01:51:50,309 --> 01:51:52,684
He knew she'd
begun writing books.

880
01:51:52,727 --> 01:51:56,101
He had also heard about
the younger brother's death.

881
01:51:56,144 --> 01:51:58,603
He had been sad for her...

882
01:51:58,645 --> 01:52:02,604
and then he hadn't known
what to tell her...

883
01:52:02,646 --> 01:52:05,103
and then he'd told her--

884
01:52:05,146 --> 01:52:07,938
he had told her
that it was as before...

885
01:52:07,980 --> 01:52:10,605
that he still loved her...

886
01:52:10,648 --> 01:52:13,107
that he would never
stop loving her...

887
01:52:13,149 --> 01:52:16,149
that he would love her
until his death.
