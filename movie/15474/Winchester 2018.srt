1
00:03:01,914 --> 00:03:03,049
Henry?

2
00:03:09,788 --> 00:03:10,958
Henry.

3
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:15,928
Henry.

4
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:26,874
Henry?

5
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,914
Darling, what is it?

6
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:38,918
What are you doing?

7
00:04:10,215 --> 00:04:13,019
He's coming for us.

8
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:50,021
I couldn't move.

9
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:53,626
I started shaking.
I was getting dizzy.

10
00:04:56,662 --> 00:04:59,131
I was sure everyone
in the room wanted to kill me.

11
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,176
I've never been so scared.

12
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,958
Pointless in the end though,
fear, isn't it?

13
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:32,633
That's your best advice, doc?

14
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:35,636
All right.

15
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,044
What do you think
controls you?

16
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:48,310
Your body or your mind?

17
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:50,315
Your money controls me, sugar.

18
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:54,351
Ah, there you go.

19
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,920
- Fine.
- Okay, okay.

20
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:59,090
I think my body and mind
control each other.

21
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,161
Well, let's find out.

22
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:03,093
Is this real?

23
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:04,294
Yes.

24
00:06:04,296 --> 00:06:05,898
- Yes?
- Yes.

25
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,100
The mind

26
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,269
is incredibly creative.

27
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:14,272
It can make us see situations

28
00:06:15,272 --> 00:06:18,612
that appear completely real,

29
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:21,879
but are in fact

30
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,115
nothing more than illusions,

31
00:06:25,117 --> 00:06:28,886
perceptions of truth.

32
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,090
How did you do that?

33
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:36,860
Sometimes we all need
a little help

34
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:40,166
to see the difference
between reality and illusion.

35
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,869
And that's
about taking control,

36
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:49,973
about not letting fear
control you.

37
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:54,379
Because fear in the end
only exists in your mind.

38
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,720
All right.
Sorry to say good night.

39
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:06,023
I'm looking for Dr. Price.

40
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:10,795
- Good night.
- I'm Arthur Gates,

41
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:14,165
Chief Legal Officer of the
Winchester Repeating Arms Company.

42
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,231
Really?

43
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:17,001
See you
next week, sugar.

44
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,639
You're a hard man to reach,
Dr. Price.

45
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:22,105
Good night, Nancy.

46
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:23,375
- Good night.
- Good night.

47
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,378
I'm on sabbatical.

48
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,049
Good night.

49
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:32,382
What do you want?
A prescription?

50
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:34,721
I've come to offer
you employment.

51
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:38,723
- Whiskey?
- No, thank you.

52
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:41,958
Are you familiar with Sarah
Winchester, Dr. Price?

53
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,460
Mrs. Winchester's
husband William

54
00:07:44,462 --> 00:07:45,996
was the majority shareholder

55
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:49,399
of the Winchester
Repeating Arms Company.

56
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:51,234
Twenty-five years ago,
William passed,

57
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:54,207
leaving Mrs. Winchester
a rather large inheritance,

58
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,775
and 51% of the company.

59
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:01,413
Mrs. Winchester also lost
her only child, Annie.

60
00:08:03,414 --> 00:08:04,982
It's said in her grief,

61
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:09,351
she turned to a medium...
Spiritualist of some sort.

62
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:13,189
The medium may have taken
advantage of her mental state.

63
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:15,826
That's not uncommon
after a tragedy.

64
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:16,994
I can assure you,

65
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,734
Sarah Winchester
is anything but common.

66
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,399
Aye, after her spiritual
encounter,

67
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:26,035
she moved across the country
to San Jose,

68
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:27,804
- where she purchased what...
- Where's my...

69
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:30,206
Was then
an eight-room house.

70
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,174
Maybe it's in
the garden room.

71
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:33,944
She spent the last 20 years
expanding it.

72
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:37,547
What stands now is

73
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:40,184
a gargantuan seven
storied structure,

74
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,251
with no apparent
rhyme or reason,

75
00:08:42,253 --> 00:08:43,319
no master plan,

76
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:48,423
each maze of halls
more confusing than the next.

77
00:08:48,425 --> 00:08:51,094
A house under
never-ending construction,

78
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:53,798
built on the orders
of a grieving widow

79
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,433
whose mind is as chaotic
as the house itself.

80
00:08:57,435 --> 00:09:00,905
Over the years, she's become
more and more reclusive.

81
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,174
Last month,
the Board of Directors

82
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,573
enacted its right to assess

83
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:06,944
Mrs. Winchester's
state of mind,

84
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:10,981
to determine if she's fit
to control the company.

85
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:14,384
You want to take it
away from her?

86
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:16,522
We're worried about
her sanity, Dr. Price.

87
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:21,093
We need a professional.

88
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,928
Any kind of diagnosis

89
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,563
from such a long distance
would be impossible.

90
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:28,463
Well, Mrs. Winchester's agreed

91
00:09:28,465 --> 00:09:30,366
to let you stay
at the residence.

92
00:09:30,368 --> 00:09:33,139
An offer
that is exceedingly rare.

93
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:37,472
An unwilling patient,
the long distance.

94
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:39,576
This is not
something ordinarily I...

95
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:40,844
Name the amount.

96
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:41,978
Doesn't really work like that.

97
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,082
How much do you owe?

98
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,150
Mortgage?

99
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,888
Hospital expenses?

100
00:09:49,353 --> 00:09:50,455
Medicine?

101
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,890
Three hundred.

102
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,226
We'll pay six.

103
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:56,929
For the appropriate assessment.

104
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:49,146
Mrs. Winchester
requests the bay window frame

105
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,981
be installed by sundown.

106
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,118
Move with haste.

107
00:11:02,526 --> 00:11:03,528
Let me get that, sir.

108
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:05,999
Thank you.

109
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,069
Busy day
of construction here, sir.

110
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:14,137
- Yes.
- Days and nights

111
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:15,371
are always busy here.

112
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:17,439
Really? Nights, too?

113
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:19,409
Right round
the clock, sir.

114
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:20,279
This way.

115
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:25,616
Most of the rooms
don't stay up very long,

116
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,550
like Mrs. Winchester's
garden room there.

117
00:11:28,552 --> 00:11:30,954
That might not
last the season.

118
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,122
Really?

119
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,657
Check the measurements
here have been done.

120
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:37,026
Please wait
in the library, sir.

121
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:39,565
I'll call for Mrs. Marriott.

122
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:38,054
- Jesus!
- My apologies, sir.

123
00:12:38,056 --> 00:12:40,189
The door was making
a terrible racket.

124
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:41,356
No, no, no, no, no.

125
00:12:41,358 --> 00:12:43,326
That's quite all right.

126
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:44,530
Gave me a fright.

127
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,236
Dr. Price?

128
00:12:54,238 --> 00:12:55,538
- Yes.
- Welcome.

129
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,808
Marion Marriott,
Mrs. Winchester's niece.

130
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,543
Oh. Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

131
00:13:00,545 --> 00:13:05,181
I must say, I have never
quite seen a house like this.

132
00:13:05,183 --> 00:13:08,351
My aunt advised me
of the nature of your visit.

133
00:13:08,353 --> 00:13:10,154
As you are aware,
it is unfortunate timing,

134
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,486
so I would ask you
to behave in a manner

135
00:13:11,488 --> 00:13:13,255
befitting the circumstance.

136
00:13:13,257 --> 00:13:14,791
Unfortunate, how?

137
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,095
A tragedy occurred.

138
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:17,660
Oh.

139
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:19,163
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

140
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,767
Are you carrying firearms?

141
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,099
Should I be?

142
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:24,399
Aunt Sarah forbids them.

143
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:26,401
Well.

144
00:13:26,403 --> 00:13:28,671
I'm completely unarmed.

145
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:31,441
Good. You, like I,
like everyone,

146
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:32,809
are guests
in Aunt Sarah's home.

147
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,611
You will abide
by her rules.

148
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:35,878
Understood.

149
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,115
You are to stay in this section
of the house, the east wing.

150
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,217
Aunt Sarah's private domains
are off limits.

151
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,220
Understood.

152
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:43,654
So...

153
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,588
Are you close to your aunt?

154
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,623
Is this already part of
your evaluation, Dr. Price?

155
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,527
No, ma'am,
it is not.

156
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,394
Yes.

157
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:52,862
Aunt Sarah
is an exceptional woman.

158
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:54,230
She does not deserve
to be treated

159
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:56,235
with anything less
than complete respect.

160
00:13:57,267 --> 00:13:58,638
Yes, ma'am. Quite right.

161
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,411
May I?

162
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:12,181
This is the grand ballroom,

163
00:14:12,183 --> 00:14:14,218
built almost entirely
without nails.

164
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,788
The walls and parquet floor are
made of six separate hard woods.

165
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,359
The silver chandelier
was imported from Germany.

166
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,396
Follow me, Doctor.

167
00:14:28,398 --> 00:14:30,332
There are almost one hundred
rooms in the house.

168
00:14:30,334 --> 00:14:31,837
It's easy to get lost.

169
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:06,803
How unusual.

170
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,604
Aunt Sarah
suffers from arthritis.

171
00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:11,540
This makes climbing stairs
manageable for her.

172
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:13,846
The house can be overwhelming.
Do keep up.

173
00:15:20,384 --> 00:15:21,887
What is this?

174
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:24,691
It's a communication device.

175
00:15:25,355 --> 00:15:26,924
Really?

176
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,958
You speak into the holes,
and a series of pipes

177
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,897
travel the sound
to the desired room.

178
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:39,369
- Ingenious.
- Yes.

179
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:42,237
You'll find many of my aunt's
inventions are state of the art.

180
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:44,841
I trust you'll find everything
you need with the room.

181
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,678
Aunt Sarah will be
joining us for dinner.

182
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,478
Perhaps you would like
to freshen up beforehand.

183
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,483
I very much look forward
to meeting your aunt.

184
00:15:53,483 --> 00:15:54,751
Aunt Sarah
would not approve of you

185
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:55,754
drinking before dinner hour.

186
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,725
Her sense of smell
is still as acute as mine.

187
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:02,628
Respect her wishes.

188
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,275
You were right about me, Ruby.

189
00:16:20,377 --> 00:16:21,681
I am

190
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:25,817
a fraud.

191
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,903
You're a phony, hmm?

192
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:49,942
That feels good.

193
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:58,347
Well, you don't know
what you're doing.

194
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,688
You don't know
what you're doing.

195
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,927
Oh, yeah. You prove nothing.

196
00:17:15,365 --> 00:17:17,636
For Christ's sake.

197
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:22,306
Jesus Christ!

198
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,476
Ah!

199
00:18:07,618 --> 00:18:09,119
Who are you?
What do you want?

200
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:12,388
Dinner will be served
in 10 minutes.

201
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,057
- You're alone, yes?
- Yes, sir.

202
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,959
- Nobody else with you?
- No, sir.

203
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:19,495
No? You didn't see anyone
just come out of here?

204
00:18:19,497 --> 00:18:20,633
Are you all right, sir?

205
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:25,467
I'm fine. I just thought
someone else was...

206
00:18:25,469 --> 00:18:27,405
Well, I thought I saw
someone else in my room.

207
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,505
Interesting.

208
00:18:30,507 --> 00:18:32,007
Look, I'm fine, yes.

209
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:33,677
Dinner in 10 minutes, yes?

210
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,715
- Sir.
- Good, thank you.

211
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:44,691
Take it nice and easy.

212
00:18:47,058 --> 00:18:48,094
There.

213
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:06,678
Henry.

214
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:08,614
Stop it.

215
00:19:18,022 --> 00:19:19,091
Henry, stop that!

216
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:24,764
Henry. Henry! Just...

217
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,166
Henry, you must be
very excited

218
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,738
to spend some time
in your great aunt's house.

219
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,473
We're here
because Father died.

220
00:19:38,743 --> 00:19:41,710
Well, I am very sorry
for your loss, young man.

221
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:43,913
- I'm not.
- Henry!

222
00:19:43,915 --> 00:19:47,515
It's my fault.
I didn't mean to pry.

223
00:19:47,517 --> 00:19:49,756
Of course, you did.
That's why you're here.

224
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:54,457
Yes. Suppose so.

225
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,593
I recently lost
someone myself.

226
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,594
So if you feel like
discussing anything,

227
00:19:58,596 --> 00:20:00,831
I might be able
to provide some assistance

228
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,401
to yourself
or young Henry here.

229
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,236
I imagine you must be
very good at your job

230
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:09,909
if Aunt Sarah chose you
to be her assessor.

231
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,579
I had no idea
she chose me herself.

232
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,581
I'm just hoping I can help.

233
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,082
If you want to help, Doctor,

234
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,683
you can give my aunt
a clean bill of health

235
00:20:20,685 --> 00:20:22,785
and be on your way.

236
00:20:22,787 --> 00:20:24,621
Well, I have a duty
to my profession

237
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,758
and an obligation
to my employers.

238
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:30,129
Aunt Sarah is your employer.

239
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,099
It is still half her company.

240
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,916
- Madam.
- Good evening, Madam.

241
00:20:54,518 --> 00:20:56,087
Good evening, Madam.

242
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,188
Dr. Price.

243
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,958
Mrs. Winchester, it's a
pleasure to finally meet you.

244
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,324
The pleasure is due
to the lawyers

245
00:21:36,326 --> 00:21:39,097
of the Winchester
Repeating Arms Company.

246
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,198
Yes.

247
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,900
I suppose you're right.

248
00:21:44,902 --> 00:21:47,770
I hope everything has been
to your satisfaction so far?

249
00:21:47,772 --> 00:21:49,906
I cannot fault
the hospitality.

250
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:53,079
It's quite a special house,
is it not?

251
00:21:54,344 --> 00:21:56,582
Now that, ma'am,
is a fact beyond dispute.

252
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,152
Thank you.

253
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,254
I understand the Winchester
is still considered

254
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:07,923
the superior rifle
on the market, ma'am.

255
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:09,194
Superior?

256
00:22:10,761 --> 00:22:12,296
Superior at what?

257
00:22:13,664 --> 00:22:16,600
Accuracy, range,
stopping power.

258
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:18,034
Killing.

259
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,939
Indiscriminate killing.

260
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,939
Very superior.

261
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:27,043
You feel responsible for
the misuse of your product?

262
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,844
If a weapon works
as intended,

263
00:22:28,846 --> 00:22:31,046
one can hardly
call it a misuse.

264
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:33,216
Well, it can
be used for good or bad,

265
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,121
depending on the person
wielding it.

266
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:40,288
Yes.

267
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:44,293
Then again, perhaps roller skates
are a less dangerous endeavor.

268
00:22:44,295 --> 00:22:45,829
The company is expanding,

269
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,897
looking for other
opportunities.

270
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:50,232
I understand that was at
your behest, Mrs. Winchester?

271
00:22:50,234 --> 00:22:51,300
It was.

272
00:22:51,302 --> 00:22:53,267
To the displeasure
of the board.

273
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:55,872
It appears that strapping
wheels to one's feet

274
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,178
can also be a
perilous endeavor.

275
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:02,848
Hear, hear.

276
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:25,669
<i>Tell me the story
about the farmer</i>

277
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:27,836
- <i>who owned the old mule.</i>
- <i>No.</i>

278
00:23:27,838 --> 00:23:30,108
<i>I always liked that story.</i>

279
00:23:31,108 --> 00:23:33,709
<i>A delusional disorder.</i>

280
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:35,178
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>That's what you called it.</i>

281
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,445
<i>Yes.</i>

282
00:23:36,447 --> 00:23:37,980
<i>I don't want to talk anymore.</i>

283
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:40,115
<i>I need you to believe me.</i>

284
00:23:40,117 --> 00:23:44,219
<i>I want to be with you, Ruby.
Together forever.</i>

285
00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:15,153
Hello?

286
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:30,068
Hello?

287
00:27:05,288 --> 00:27:06,922
Christ!

288
00:27:12,528 --> 00:27:14,329
You've poisoned
your mind, Eric.

289
00:27:14,331 --> 00:27:16,430
You've poisoned your mind.

290
00:27:16,432 --> 00:27:18,266
I need some air.

291
00:28:40,484 --> 00:28:41,587
Deja vu.

292
00:30:13,644 --> 00:30:14,712
Hey!

293
00:30:16,713 --> 00:30:18,348
Hey!

294
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,652
Move, hey! Move! Move!

295
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,763
I see you.

296
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:38,670
Oh, Henry! Darling!

297
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:43,474
What's happening
to you, sweetheart?

298
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:50,048
Thank you.

299
00:30:54,818 --> 00:30:56,754
Darling,
what's happening to you?

300
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,325
Mrs. Winchester,

301
00:31:04,327 --> 00:31:06,261
I really must have
your full attention.

302
00:31:06,263 --> 00:31:07,763
Oh, you have it, Dr. Price.

303
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,766
Yes, but perhaps you would
be more comfortable if...

304
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:13,534
Last night was quite
a traumatic event.

305
00:31:13,536 --> 00:31:15,837
I'm grateful for your actions.

306
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:17,873
I fear you may
have me at a...

307
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:20,374
An emotional
disadvantage today.

308
00:31:20,376 --> 00:31:22,178
Yes, I understand.

309
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,379
I don't mean to pry,
but has Master Henry

310
00:31:24,381 --> 00:31:26,284
been prone to sleepwalking
in the past?

311
00:31:27,316 --> 00:31:29,316
No.

312
00:31:29,318 --> 00:31:30,753
But you may know,
he did witness

313
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:32,224
the death of his father.

314
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,691
Yes.

315
00:31:36,426 --> 00:31:37,391
Well, this is the first

316
00:31:37,393 --> 00:31:39,527
in a series of sessions
I wish to conduct.

317
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:42,330
And I can assure you that
today will be quite benign.

318
00:31:42,332 --> 00:31:44,600
No, no, no. Let's just
get straight to it, Doctor.

319
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:47,235
You are here to assess
my erratic behavior,

320
00:31:47,237 --> 00:31:48,170
are you not?

321
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:49,906
Well, erratic behavior
is not the phrase

322
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,406
that I would've
chosen, but...

323
00:31:51,408 --> 00:31:53,676
- Now, I'll speak with you truthfully.
- Please.

324
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:55,844
But you will do me
the same courtesy.

325
00:31:55,846 --> 00:31:57,312
Of course.

326
00:31:57,314 --> 00:31:59,316
Do you suffer
from soldier's syndrome?

327
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:01,183
I'm sorry?

328
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:04,518
Are you an abuser
of medication?

329
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,756
Mrs. Winchester, I think it's
best if I ask the questions.

330
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,891
Your wife, did she believe
you are a good therapist?

331
00:32:09,893 --> 00:32:11,493
We're not here
to discuss my wife.

332
00:32:11,495 --> 00:32:13,198
Your wife Ruby?

333
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:17,332
No, we are not.

334
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:19,434
And I would appreciate
your honesty.

335
00:32:19,436 --> 00:32:20,803
Are you an abuser
of medication?

336
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,305
No, I'm not.

337
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:30,813
- So...
- I will share a fact with you,

338
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,413
which you may
find questionable.

339
00:32:32,415 --> 00:32:34,683
But I assure you,
it is a fact.

340
00:32:34,685 --> 00:32:35,686
Please.

341
00:32:36,486 --> 00:32:37,823
I am cursed.

342
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:39,956
Cursed, how?

343
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,556
Have you read my papers?

344
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:43,324
- Of course, I have.
- And what did they say?

345
00:32:43,326 --> 00:32:44,459
Well, among many things,

346
00:32:44,461 --> 00:32:46,829
they say that this is
the house that spirits built.

347
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:50,334
See, profiting from such
a thing as violence and death,

348
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,671
that is a wickedness that
follows you like a shadow.

349
00:32:56,673 --> 00:32:59,842
Yes, we might also call
those shadows "guilt."

350
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:02,544
But tell me, how do these
shadows follow you?

351
00:33:02,546 --> 00:33:03,912
I may be getting old,
Dr. Price,

352
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:06,313
but I assure you,
I have not lost my senses.

353
00:33:06,315 --> 00:33:10,221
I know the difference
between illusion and reality.

354
00:33:10,887 --> 00:33:12,289
I see.

355
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:18,493
Your mind rules your body.

356
00:33:18,495 --> 00:33:20,662
The mind
can be incredibly creative.

357
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:24,667
But it can also,
at times, fail us.

358
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,901
My mind has never failed me.

359
00:33:26,903 --> 00:33:30,605
What we see, taste, and touch

360
00:33:30,607 --> 00:33:33,642
are interpreted and processed
to give us our truth.

361
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:36,711
And that truth can in turn
be an illusion,

362
00:33:36,713 --> 00:33:41,686
created, distorted, by grief.

363
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,925
Do you believe in ghosts,
Dr. Price?

364
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:50,457
No, ma'am. Why would I?

365
00:33:50,459 --> 00:33:53,595
Offering my staff that bill
would be greatly appreciated.

366
00:33:53,597 --> 00:33:55,362
Even the nickel
inside the bill

367
00:33:55,364 --> 00:33:57,568
would be a respectable start.

368
00:33:59,002 --> 00:34:01,704
Really! Silly illusions?

369
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,338
Do you take me for a fool?

370
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,640
No, ma'am. I do not.

371
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:06,074
No more diversions
from reality.

372
00:34:06,076 --> 00:34:07,810
No more parlor tricks.

373
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,912
And your medication
will have to be confiscated.

374
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:12,615
Mrs. Winchester, I'm sorry, but I
must insist, I'm not a child...

375
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,684
- This is my home, Dr. Price.
- And I will not be...

376
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:16,588
You will obey my rules.

377
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,988
If you want me to open up
this house for you,

378
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,626
you need clarity.

379
00:34:25,428 --> 00:34:27,297
Do you have another
question for me?

380
00:34:29,466 --> 00:34:30,468
Yes, ma'am.

381
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,074
Is it really necessary
to confine me to quarters?

382
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,677
That is Madam's wish, sir.

383
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,811
Hmm.

384
00:34:42,813 --> 00:34:44,613
And the condition
of Master Henry?

385
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:47,415
He too is confined
to quarters.

386
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:49,854
And Mrs. Marriott
has not left his side.

387
00:35:19,382 --> 00:35:20,686
Damn it!

388
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:36,898
"Sir, the members of the board
eagerly await your evaluation.

389
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,934
"I trust you will make
an accurate assessment.

390
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:41,439
"Regards, Arthur C. Gates,
Chief Legal Officer."

391
00:35:53,617 --> 00:35:55,818
<i>Sarah Winchester's
psychological assessment</i>

392
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,119
<i>and mental status
examination.</i>

393
00:35:58,121 --> 00:36:01,559
<i>Dr. Eric A. Price,
April 16, 1906.</i>

394
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,959
<i>Appearance, normal.</i>

395
00:36:04,961 --> 00:36:07,996
<i>Hygiene, physical
characteristics, all normal.</i>

396
00:36:07,998 --> 00:36:11,466
<i>Patient struggles with the
loss of her husband and child.</i>

397
00:36:11,468 --> 00:36:13,869
<i>Her behavior is at times
slightly aggressive.</i>

398
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:16,538
<i>Perception,
visual hallucinations</i>

399
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,978
<i>that patient often refers to
as shadows or ghosts.</i>

400
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:24,915
I feel them, their presence.

401
00:36:32,856 --> 00:36:33,858
Go on.

402
00:36:38,628 --> 00:36:42,496
I feel their presence,
their energy.

403
00:36:42,498 --> 00:36:46,500
<i>Their unfinished business
has brought them here.</i>

404
00:36:46,502 --> 00:36:48,469
Do you perhaps
in any way blame them

405
00:36:48,471 --> 00:36:51,005
for the death
of your husband and child?

406
00:36:51,007 --> 00:36:55,542
I will mourn William
and dear Annie always.

407
00:36:55,544 --> 00:36:58,180
I love all my family
very much, Dr. Price.

408
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:00,983
They are the true
riches of my life,

409
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:04,552
and I will do whatever
it takes to protect them.

410
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:19,869
Can you tell me why the...

411
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,840
Why those bells
chime at midnight?

412
00:37:22,538 --> 00:37:23,909
It's midnight, sir.

413
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,209
Well, yes.

414
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:28,780
But is there
any significance to it?

415
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,550
It's midnight, sir.

416
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:35,954
Thank you.

417
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:02,090
I swear, the laudanum
is still in my system.

418
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:06,393
Let's just hope
it's withdrawals.

419
00:41:06,395 --> 00:41:10,201
It always was withdrawals.
It had to be. Had to be.

420
00:41:14,871 --> 00:41:17,005
<i>I have a question
for you, Dr. Price.</i>

421
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:18,773
Again, Mrs. Winchester,
it's best if I ask...

422
00:41:18,775 --> 00:41:20,373
What is it like to die?

423
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:21,341
Talking about your...

424
00:41:21,343 --> 00:41:24,014
Deceased for three minutes,
were you not?

425
00:41:28,317 --> 00:41:32,054
You know, I keep records

426
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:35,255
of all the lives
a Winchester has taken.

427
00:41:35,257 --> 00:41:38,996
Hundreds have been reported.
Probably thousands haven't.

428
00:41:40,296 --> 00:41:42,798
The guilty, the innocent...

429
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,932
The rifle doesn't discriminate.

430
00:41:44,934 --> 00:41:48,301
And many of the souls
make their way to this house.

431
00:41:48,303 --> 00:41:50,437
That's impressive.

432
00:41:50,439 --> 00:41:52,206
As you can clearly see,
I am still here.

433
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:54,375
So perhaps you could do me

434
00:41:54,377 --> 00:41:56,815
the kindness of taking me
off that shelf.

435
00:41:57,513 --> 00:41:58,849
You were shot.

436
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,151
I was.

437
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,325
This.

438
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:11,795
And it did kill me.

439
00:42:16,566 --> 00:42:19,771
You kept it and refurbished it.

440
00:42:20,402 --> 00:42:22,905
- I did.
- Why?

441
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:25,941
Well, because
it's a reminder of my past.

442
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:28,177
Because it's my
connection to death

443
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,847
and to all that I've lost.

444
00:42:32,048 --> 00:42:33,281
Instruments of death

445
00:42:33,283 --> 00:42:35,818
have a powerful connection
to the afterlife.

446
00:42:39,889 --> 00:42:42,224
We hold on to mementos
to help us heal.

447
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,095
But sometimes,
they do more harm than good.

448
00:42:45,595 --> 00:42:46,862
Precisely.

449
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:50,334
So tell me, what do you think
it is you're holding on to?

450
00:42:54,236 --> 00:42:56,073
Have you ever been
to a spiritualist?

451
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,874
But I understand you have.

452
00:42:59,876 --> 00:43:01,043
You know, it is believed

453
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:02,945
that once we've departed
this world,

454
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:04,847
we can see others

455
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:07,281
who have left
their physical selves behind.

456
00:43:07,283 --> 00:43:08,217
Is that right?

457
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:10,989
Have you ever
experienced such a thing?

458
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,925
I can't say that I have, no.

459
00:43:14,457 --> 00:43:16,557
Is it painful to die?

460
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:17,592
Mrs. Winchester,

461
00:43:17,594 --> 00:43:19,595
we really must continue
with this evaluation.

462
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,164
Please, Doctor. Please.

463
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,534
Yes.

464
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,972
And then nothing.

465
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:31,307
Just a calmness.

466
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:36,047
And when I came back,
it was painful again.

467
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,349
If that makes sense.

468
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:40,885
Yes.

469
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:48,422
Yes, because you too
have experienced great pain.

470
00:43:48,424 --> 00:43:52,259
Grief can be far
more crippling

471
00:43:52,261 --> 00:43:53,898
than arthritis, Doctor.

472
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:56,664
Mrs. Winchester,
do you blame the shadows

473
00:43:56,666 --> 00:43:59,203
for the loss of your
husband and child?

474
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:03,439
Were you out of your room
last night?

475
00:44:08,243 --> 00:44:09,880
Yes, I was.

476
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:12,113
Thank you.

477
00:44:12,115 --> 00:44:14,517
Thank you
for telling me the truth.

478
00:44:25,561 --> 00:44:29,429
So, why all the noise?
Why all this construction?

479
00:44:29,431 --> 00:44:32,099
They want me
to build, Doctor.

480
00:44:32,101 --> 00:44:35,970
The spirits killed
by the rifle,

481
00:44:35,972 --> 00:44:37,939
they guide me.

482
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:40,440
Guide you in drawing
building plans?

483
00:44:40,442 --> 00:44:41,579
Yes.

484
00:44:43,279 --> 00:44:44,680
For what? Why?

485
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,715
For the rooms, of course.

486
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:49,050
You see, once their rooms
are completed,

487
00:44:49,052 --> 00:44:51,054
their presence grows stronger.

488
00:44:52,455 --> 00:44:54,324
Hence, the house
that spirits built?

489
00:44:54,624 --> 00:44:55,659
Yes.

490
00:44:56,491 --> 00:44:58,559
The shadows that follow me,

491
00:44:58,561 --> 00:45:01,095
they have unfinished business.

492
00:45:01,097 --> 00:45:03,934
You saw what I did last night,
didn't you?

493
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,502
I did.

494
00:45:07,536 --> 00:45:09,473
At the chime of midnight,
they clamor.

495
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:13,642
<i>The bells summon them.</i>

496
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:18,613
They communicate
through plans, drawings.

497
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:22,482
<i>They want me to reconstruct
the rooms that they died in,</i>

498
00:45:22,484 --> 00:45:26,054
then they can enter our world.

499
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,487
And the trouble is,
I don't always know

500
00:45:27,489 --> 00:45:29,124
who it is I'm speaking with.

501
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:31,662
It could be some
innocent bystander

502
00:45:32,695 --> 00:45:35,666
<i>or a victim of a crime,</i>

503
00:45:38,334 --> 00:45:40,202
or someone else.

504
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:41,706
Who else, Mrs. Winchester?

505
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:46,373
<i>Last night,
a spirit more powerful</i>

506
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:50,581
<i>than any I've encountered
endangered my family.</i>

507
00:45:52,482 --> 00:45:54,085
Who are you?

508
00:45:55,753 --> 00:46:00,524
Doctor, who do you see
in this room at this moment?

509
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,626
Just you.

510
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,495
Only me?

511
00:46:14,504 --> 00:46:15,573
Just you.

512
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,775
It will take time.

513
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,679
You still need to clear
your head.

514
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:43,496
Oh, sir!

515
00:46:43,498 --> 00:46:44,498
I would like to check in

516
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,101
on Mrs. Marriott
and Master Henry, if I may.

517
00:46:47,103 --> 00:46:49,070
I will inquire, sir.

518
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:51,208
Perhaps, may I
ask you a question?

519
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:53,440
A question, sir?

520
00:46:53,442 --> 00:46:56,312
Yes. I mean, tell me,
have you ever seen any...

521
00:46:57,146 --> 00:46:58,515
Any ghosts?

522
00:46:59,115 --> 00:47:00,383
No, sir.

523
00:47:01,684 --> 00:47:04,686
But you have heard
the rumors, the stories?

524
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:08,222
I have heard tall tales.

525
00:47:08,224 --> 00:47:11,225
Some taller than others.

526
00:47:11,227 --> 00:47:13,764
Have you ever witnessed
anything out of the ordinary?

527
00:47:21,771 --> 00:47:24,572
So display cabinets
along the walls,

528
00:47:24,574 --> 00:47:26,710
and then a line of them
down the middle of the room.

529
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:28,943
Yes, ma'am.

530
00:47:28,945 --> 00:47:32,448
And what type of Winchester
would you like delivered?

531
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:37,319
Every type, every model.

532
00:47:39,321 --> 00:47:41,822
<i>Okay, let's go back.</i>

533
00:47:41,824 --> 00:47:45,159
Tell me please what happens
once these rooms are finished?

534
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:47,228
Well, the spirit's
presence grows

535
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,230
more powerful and more...

536
00:47:49,232 --> 00:47:50,865
<i>More focused.</i>

537
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:52,566
<i>Their voices get stronger.</i>

538
00:47:52,568 --> 00:47:53,869
And we converse.

539
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,738
Converse how?
About what?

540
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,709
I show them my deep remorse.

541
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:04,377
I want to help them let go of
their grief and their anger.

542
00:48:04,379 --> 00:48:05,680
And how do they react?

543
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:09,184
Favorably. Yes, mostly.

544
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:11,484
Once they are at peace,
then they can move on.

545
00:48:11,486 --> 00:48:15,222
We can tear down their room,
and then we start again.

546
00:48:15,224 --> 00:48:18,161
And are there those that
don't react so favorably?

547
00:48:19,595 --> 00:48:21,395
Yes.

548
00:48:21,397 --> 00:48:23,798
Yes, we lock them away.

549
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,834
How does one lock
a spirit away?

550
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:28,670
Thirteen nails seals them in.

551
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:30,905
<i>Once they find peace,
we can release them,</i>

552
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:32,807
<i>and they can leave this house.</i>

553
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,375
<i>So 13 is</i>

554
00:48:34,377 --> 00:48:36,377
a devilish number to
protect you from devils?

555
00:48:36,379 --> 00:48:39,245
No, no, no.
That is a divine number,

556
00:48:39,247 --> 00:48:41,816
to protect the cycle
of life and death.

557
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:43,684
And does this divine number
always work?

558
00:48:43,686 --> 00:48:48,125
I mean, what if a spirit simply
doesn't want to be locked away?

559
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:51,726
The unmendable souls

560
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:55,328
prey upon the innocent
and the pure.

561
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:58,135
And by the innocent and pure,
you mean Master Henry?

562
00:49:01,303 --> 00:49:02,906
We can stand between them.

563
00:49:03,773 --> 00:49:05,542
I and you.

564
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,275
With your assistance,

565
00:49:08,277 --> 00:49:11,182
I can help this spirit
find peace.

566
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:18,887
You don't believe any of this.
I understand.

567
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,621
Ma'am, I do not.

568
00:49:20,623 --> 00:49:25,726
I do not believe in anything
I cannot see or study.

569
00:49:25,728 --> 00:49:27,963
Mrs. Winchester,
you have built this house,

570
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,930
this place, this reality.

571
00:49:29,932 --> 00:49:32,334
Therefore, you can control it,
can you not?

572
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,936
Yes, perhaps.

573
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:36,402
We all have the ability

574
00:49:36,404 --> 00:49:38,572
to create and control
our own reality.

575
00:49:38,574 --> 00:49:41,976
But for some, for you,
Mrs. Winchester, for you,

576
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:43,813
that will mean letting go
of the past.

577
00:49:45,448 --> 00:49:47,552
Make your assessment, Doctor.

578
00:49:49,552 --> 00:49:53,755
Say what you feel is the truth
about Sarah Winchester.

579
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:56,226
And if that means you lose
control of your company?

580
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,397
There are worse things in this
world to lose than that, Doctor.

581
00:50:08,704 --> 00:50:09,973
I see you've finished
the new room.

582
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:13,041
Of course.

583
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:14,778
Must be very profitable for you,

584
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:18,579
all this working
round the clock.

585
00:50:18,581 --> 00:50:20,313
We all appreciate

586
00:50:20,315 --> 00:50:23,317
Mrs. Winchester's
ongoing employment

587
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:24,922
and her creativity.

588
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,321
I must say, that creativity

589
00:50:27,323 --> 00:50:30,825
certainly leads to some
rather odd designs.

590
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:33,326
Do you think it possible
a woman of advancing years

591
00:50:33,328 --> 00:50:35,996
may be susceptible
to flights of fancy?

592
00:50:35,998 --> 00:50:38,668
No, sir. I do not.

593
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,838
Could I see inside
the garden room, please?

594
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,675
I had one similar, and I would
be much obliged if...

595
00:50:46,677 --> 00:50:48,879
No, sir. That room is sealed.

596
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,016
Therefore, it's off limits.

597
00:50:52,715 --> 00:50:54,719
Good day, Doctor.

598
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:02,590
Well, Eric,
that's going really well.

599
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:17,775
How is he?

600
00:51:18,941 --> 00:51:20,974
Fine. Resting.

601
00:51:20,976 --> 00:51:23,913
Has he ever been prone to
behavior like that in the past?

602
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,813
No.

603
00:51:25,815 --> 00:51:26,883
Never?

604
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:33,624
She told you, didn't she,
about the Winchester curse?

605
00:51:33,923 --> 00:51:35,622
Yes.

606
00:51:35,624 --> 00:51:38,391
Do you believe her,
or do you think she's crazy?

607
00:51:38,393 --> 00:51:41,729
I think crazy
is a dangerous word.

608
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:43,898
People have certain
medical conditions

609
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,534
and with the right
diagnosis and treatment,

610
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:47,938
they can be helped.

611
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:54,811
<i>I do not believe
in curses, Doctor.</i>

612
00:51:55,644 --> 00:51:57,878
<i>Good. Nor do I.</i>

613
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,813
<i>I think perhaps
your son's behavior</i>

614
00:51:59,815 --> 00:52:02,484
<i>has been triggered by the
sudden death of his father.</i>

615
00:52:02,985 --> 00:52:04,818
<i>Yes.</i>

616
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:07,356
<i>Could you tell me
how your husband died?</i>

617
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,090
He had demons,

618
00:52:10,092 --> 00:52:14,065
but not the kind that my aunt
believes haunt her.

619
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,800
<i>Go on.</i>

620
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:22,836
<i>Aunt Sarah's husband
died suddenly of tuberculosis.</i>

621
00:52:22,838 --> 00:52:25,041
<i>And then she lost poor Annie.</i>

622
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:29,079
<i>She believes our family curse
is spreading.</i>

623
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:42,023
<i>My husband loved the drink</i>

624
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:44,525
more than his wife and child.

625
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,463
I believe that was his curse.

626
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:52,666
Now he is gone, and I'm alone,

627
00:52:52,668 --> 00:52:54,739
better off in so many ways
without him.

628
00:52:56,504 --> 00:52:58,005
But it terrifies me.

629
00:52:58,007 --> 00:53:00,476
Don't let that fear
control you.

630
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:03,880
Fear only exists in your mind.

631
00:53:04,947 --> 00:53:07,014
When we fear the most,

632
00:53:07,016 --> 00:53:09,950
we must take control.

633
00:53:09,952 --> 00:53:12,686
You can be a fighter.
You can be a protector.

634
00:53:12,688 --> 00:53:14,758
I do not feel like a protector.

635
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:17,595
Aunt Sarah is the fighter.

636
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:21,097
- Yes.
- She would die to save us.

637
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,530
Perhaps.

638
00:53:23,532 --> 00:53:26,468
Have you ever loved someone so
much you would die to save them?

639
00:53:28,504 --> 00:53:30,671
I have.

640
00:53:30,673 --> 00:53:36,577
I also knew someone who was
haunted by demons, voices.

641
00:53:36,579 --> 00:53:39,549
And did the time ever come
when you had to protect them?

642
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,719
It did.

643
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:44,888
What did you do?

644
00:53:46,755 --> 00:53:47,958
I died.

645
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:14,818
Henry!

646
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:16,887
Ahh!

647
00:54:20,923 --> 00:54:21,925
Henry.

648
00:54:22,524 --> 00:54:23,590
Henry!

649
00:54:38,807 --> 00:54:40,041
Henry.

650
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:41,811
Henry! It's me!

651
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:10,907
No.

652
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:13,210
Ah!

653
00:55:18,914 --> 00:55:20,884
Henry! Henry!

654
00:55:22,184 --> 00:55:25,588
- Henry! Henry!
- Stop it! Stop!

655
00:55:26,121 --> 00:55:27,286
Stop, Henry, stop!

656
00:55:27,288 --> 00:55:29,292
- Who are you?
- Die!

657
00:55:40,936 --> 00:55:42,005
Mother?

658
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,974
Oh, Henry.

659
00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:47,744
Henry. Henry.

660
00:55:55,784 --> 00:55:57,084
I'm so sorry, Aunt Sarah.

661
00:55:57,086 --> 00:55:58,753
I've let you down,
and I've let Henry down.

662
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:01,121
No, no.

663
00:56:01,123 --> 00:56:04,290
This spirit has a power
we've not seen before.

664
00:56:04,292 --> 00:56:05,996
Oh, my God.

665
00:56:06,862 --> 00:56:08,731
It can take over a mind.

666
00:56:11,265 --> 00:56:13,366
John, send everyone home.

667
00:56:13,368 --> 00:56:15,335
Only we in this room
must remain.

668
00:56:15,337 --> 00:56:16,435
Yes, ma'am.

669
00:56:16,437 --> 00:56:19,139
This child must be taken
to a hospital immediately.

670
00:56:19,141 --> 00:56:20,807
No, no.
We must watch over him.

671
00:56:20,809 --> 00:56:21,943
To a hospital immediately.

672
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:23,677
No. No one else
will understand.

673
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:25,079
- He must stay here.
- This is insanity.

674
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:26,213
We will watch over him.

675
00:56:26,215 --> 00:56:28,018
Dr. Price may be right.

676
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:30,851
No. No. We will protect him.

677
00:56:30,853 --> 00:56:32,351
We will protect him
at all costs.

678
00:56:32,353 --> 00:56:33,655
John, come with me.

679
00:56:33,657 --> 00:56:34,858
Aunt Sarah!

680
00:56:36,992 --> 00:56:39,726
Ma'am, I insist that
you receive medical treatment.

681
00:56:39,728 --> 00:56:42,796
Seal that door.
Thirteen nails.

682
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:43,900
Now.

683
00:56:44,668 --> 00:56:45,669
Now!

684
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:47,838
Yes, ma'am.

685
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,845
You leave my family alone.

686
00:56:57,245 --> 00:56:59,413
You speak with me.

687
00:57:06,388 --> 00:57:08,321
Let's just think this through.

688
00:57:08,323 --> 00:57:10,257
Please, Mrs. Marriott,
be rational.

689
00:57:10,259 --> 00:57:12,927
Henry clearly has a trauma
and needs help.

690
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,326
Your aunt is caught
in a superstition.

691
00:57:14,328 --> 00:57:15,863
We need...

692
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:06,079
Thirteen hooks.

693
00:58:06,081 --> 00:58:07,981
You must listen to me.

694
00:58:07,983 --> 00:58:09,516
Is the rifle room finished?

695
00:58:09,518 --> 00:58:10,885
Yes, ma'am.

696
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:13,521
My God.
This presence is so strong.

697
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:15,088
Oh, I feel its hatred...

698
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:16,224
Oh, enough with the games!

699
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:18,159
We're taking this boy
to a hospital.

700
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,961
- We should listen to him.
- Yes!

701
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:21,228
The boy tried to kill you.

702
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:23,764
No. The shadows
will follow us.

703
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:25,066
Wherever we go.

704
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:27,466
No, Henry will not suffer
the same fate

705
00:58:27,468 --> 00:58:29,003
- as my darling Annie...
- Henry's condition

706
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,237
cannot be cured by witchcraft.

707
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:31,404
The boy needs a doctor.

708
00:58:31,406 --> 00:58:34,008
Conditions can be cured, Doctor.

709
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,408
Curses cannot.

710
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:37,211
Mrs. Marriott,
will you please listen to me?

711
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:38,377
- Marion...
- I'm...

712
00:58:38,379 --> 00:58:39,947
I'm going with Dr. Price.

713
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:41,883
- No. Henry must stay.
- I'll make the arrangements.

714
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:43,315
- Gentlemen, you'll excuse me.
- No! No!

715
00:58:43,317 --> 00:58:45,317
Marion, please!
Henry must stay.

716
00:58:45,319 --> 00:58:46,820
He must stay with us.

717
00:58:46,822 --> 00:58:48,254
Aunt Sarah, I must think
of Henry.

718
00:58:48,256 --> 00:58:50,124
I should go with him.

719
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:51,460
I will prove it to you.

720
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:55,297
Yes, I... I will.

721
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:57,299
This way.

722
00:59:14,184 --> 00:59:15,348
<i>Operator.</i>

723
00:59:18,352 --> 00:59:20,021
Winchester Repeating Arms
Company.

724
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:21,388
This is Arthur Gates.

725
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:24,858
<i>Mr. Gates,
it's Dr. Eric Price here.</i>

726
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,528
I trust the assessment
is going well, Doctor.

727
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,831
<i>I understand you received
our letter.</i>

728
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:31,232
It's fine, Mr. Gates.

729
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,568
But I require immediate transportation
to the nearest hospital.

730
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:35,936
Is everything all right?

731
00:59:35,938 --> 00:59:38,872
Everything is fine. Just please,
a driver, as soon as possible.

732
00:59:38,874 --> 00:59:41,209
- Of course, right away.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

733
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:43,077
And the assessment, Doctor?

734
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,413
You'll get what you wanted.

735
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,085
Christ!

736
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,188
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to be rude.

737
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:57,992
Sir, we're all deeply concerned
for Master Henry's well-being.

738
00:59:57,994 --> 01:00:00,259
If the anything
I can do to assist you, I...

739
01:00:00,261 --> 01:00:01,363
Well...

740
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:04,064
Actually, you can.

741
01:00:04,066 --> 01:00:06,133
I need to get my bags, please.

742
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:08,168
- Of course.
- Thank you.

743
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:09,471
Happy to help.

744
01:00:14,475 --> 01:00:17,644
<i>Mrs. Winchester is truly
a remarkable woman.</i>

745
01:00:17,646 --> 01:00:19,511
<i>She knows what she's doing.</i>

746
01:00:19,513 --> 01:00:21,081
She has created a vessel

747
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:22,650
for the deceased
to communicate with her.

748
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:24,584
She's certainly created
some architectural oddities.

749
01:00:24,586 --> 01:00:27,891
This house, I've seen things.

750
01:00:30,424 --> 01:00:32,128
I know this room.

751
01:00:33,395 --> 01:00:34,397
Things?

752
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,034
The dead.

753
01:00:38,332 --> 01:00:40,266
Criminals.

754
01:00:40,268 --> 01:00:42,337
Lost souls who met
a violent end.

755
01:00:46,308 --> 01:00:49,378
You've seen them,
haven't you?

756
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:59,653
Dr. Price, many staff
have reported hearing noises.

757
01:00:59,655 --> 01:01:02,523
They come from inside rooms
that have been nailed shut.

758
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:04,457
Strange occurrences
in those rooms...

759
01:01:04,459 --> 01:01:06,126
That is why the doors have
been sealed,

760
01:01:06,128 --> 01:01:08,460
to keep the unruly in.

761
01:01:08,462 --> 01:01:10,997
But the staff
have only heard noises.

762
01:01:10,999 --> 01:01:13,466
To see them, well,

763
01:01:13,468 --> 01:01:15,370
I believe you and I
are unique.

764
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:18,204
Really?

765
01:01:18,206 --> 01:01:20,006
Yes, perhaps it's all
just a symptom

766
01:01:20,008 --> 01:01:22,610
of Mrs. Winchester's
persuasive influence.

767
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:25,511
Sir, locking Mrs. Marriott
and her child away

768
01:01:25,513 --> 01:01:28,215
is only delaying
the inevitable.

769
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:30,184
And what is the inevitable?

770
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,584
They're all Winchester.

771
01:01:31,586 --> 01:01:33,288
They will all die.

772
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:03,283
Mr. Hansen. Is she in there?

773
01:02:03,285 --> 01:02:05,484
- Yes, Doctor.
- Good. You need to hear this.

774
01:02:05,486 --> 01:02:07,588
Mrs. Winchester,
there is a man in your employ

775
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,559
who has clearly lost his mind.
He just...

776
01:02:11,426 --> 01:02:12,693
That's him.

777
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:15,228
You saw him?
You spoke with him?

778
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:16,731
Well, yes,
I spoke with him just now.

779
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,164
The man threatened you.

780
01:02:18,166 --> 01:02:20,103
Read it. Read the paper.

781
01:02:23,305 --> 01:02:26,239
"Corporal Benjamin Joseph Block
was killed during a siege

782
01:02:26,241 --> 01:02:28,142
"at the Winchester Repeating
Arms general office."

783
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:29,308
That's impossible.

784
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:31,714
This newspaper
is 20 years old.

785
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:35,615
Cruelty, grief, and loss

786
01:02:35,617 --> 01:02:38,386
can make people do
unimaginable things.

787
01:02:42,157 --> 01:02:45,126
Ben lost two brothers
on the battlefield.

788
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:48,128
The youngest was
only 14 years old.

789
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:50,496
Their Confederate muskets
were no match

790
01:02:50,498 --> 01:02:53,301
for the Winchester rifles
of the Union Army.

791
01:02:54,202 --> 01:02:55,404
They were cut down.

792
01:03:02,243 --> 01:03:05,046
<i>Ben swore revenge.</i>

793
01:03:05,048 --> 01:03:07,148
<i>To him, the people
who created the weapon</i>

794
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,784
<i>that killed his brothers
were as guilty</i>

795
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,621
<i>as those who pulled
the trigger.</i>

796
01:03:21,395 --> 01:03:24,534
He killed 15 innocent people
that day.

797
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,568
He locked himself
in the display room.

798

<i>We used to call it
the show-off room.</i>

of the room he was killed in.

817
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,406
Yes.

818
01:05:13,408 --> 01:05:16,813
And now that it is complete,
he is in this world.

819
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:20,116
Do you see anyone, Doctor?

820
01:05:21,248 --> 01:05:22,550
It's impossible.

821
01:05:22,552 --> 01:05:24,653
Doctor, you must believe.

822
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:26,623
It's illogical.

823
01:05:37,364 --> 01:05:38,634
Corporal Block,

824
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:40,871
please,

825
01:05:42,938 --> 01:05:45,939
please feel my deep remorse

826
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:47,308
for the death of your brothers,

827
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:52,277
of James and young Harry

828
01:05:52,279 --> 01:05:54,581
by the Winchester rifle.

829
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:57,887
I know all three of you feel
pain and torment.

830
01:05:59,286 --> 01:06:01,858
But violence cannot bring
justice.

831
01:06:02,624 --> 01:06:04,324
Only more suffering,

832
01:06:04,326 --> 01:06:08,198
and I will not allow my family
to suffer anymore.

833
01:06:10,464 --> 01:06:12,900
Leave this house
with your brothers.

834
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:15,739
I hope together
you can find peace.

The farmer's old mule
fell into his well.

Go on, Eric.

What?

873
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:37,186
He heard the mule crying.

874
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:40,786
And it broke his heart.

875
01:12:40,788 --> 01:12:43,254
He chose to bury
the animal in the well

876
01:12:43,256 --> 01:12:45,227
- and put it out of its...
- Its hardship.

877
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:49,729
He started shoveling.

878
01:12:49,731 --> 01:12:53,967
The mule realized that every
time dirt fell on his back,

879
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:57,204
he could shake it off
and step up.

880
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,972
Shovel after shovel.

881
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:00,107
He could shake it off

882
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:02,108
- and he could step up...
- Shake it off.

883
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:05,111
It wasn't long
before the old mule,

884
01:13:05,113 --> 01:13:07,848
battered and exhausted,

885
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:11,117

- Saved him.
- And he overcame...

888
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:18,423
This is not real.

The voices are

892
01:13:24,297 --> 01:13:25,699

They were just inside

for you to believe me. But...

01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:32,271

01:13:32,273 --> 01:13:33,839
I should have put you in care.

Yes. Put the gun down,
Ruby, please.

904

01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:45,932
There. Done.

984
01:21:45,934 --> 01:21:47,534
Now he's locked in.

985
01:21:47,536 --> 01:21:48,671
And so are we.

986
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,684
Ben, show yourself.

987
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:05,353
Show yourself!

988
01:22:39,887 --> 01:22:43,626
Your anger will
never defeat us.

989
01:23:03,944 --> 01:23:06,648
You took everything from me!

990
01:23:14,722 --> 01:23:16,522
They're going right
through him.

991
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:18,459
- You saw him?
- Yes.

992
01:23:32,606 --> 01:23:33,708
Who's there?

993
01:23:35,408 --> 01:23:36,776
You're there.

994
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:39,279
You are there amongst
the dead.

995
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:41,914
It's not the gun.

996
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:44,552
He's afraid of something else.

997
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:55,861
You kept it
and refurbished it.

998
01:23:55,863 --> 01:23:57,599
All because it's a reminder
of my past.

999
01:23:58,533 --> 01:23:59,866
<i>Instruments of death</i>

1000
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:02,538
<i>have a powerful connection
to the afterlife.</i>

1001
01:24:04,038 --> 01:24:07,609
What should have killed him,
saved him.

1002
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:21,523
Ben, we can help you be free
of your torment.

1003
01:24:27,895 --> 01:24:29,296
I'm a mother...

1004
01:24:35,069 --> 01:24:36,103
A fighter.

1005
01:24:39,974 --> 01:24:41,043
Show yourself.

1006
01:24:44,078 --> 01:24:45,446
A protector.

1007
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:50,350
And I am not afraid.

1008
01:25:45,506 --> 01:25:46,808
<i>See the truth.</i>

1009
01:26:11,765 --> 01:26:12,900
Yes.

1010
01:26:21,474 --> 01:26:22,844
He's at peace.

1011
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:25,748
He has joined his brothers.

1012
01:26:26,713 --> 01:26:29,450
You've done it. They're gone.

1013
01:26:34,855 --> 01:26:38,059
Everybody else,
go back to your rooms.

1014
01:26:40,627 --> 01:26:41,863
All of you.

1015
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:09,057
Henry.

1016
01:27:10,591 --> 01:27:11,991
Henry!

1017
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:14,496
Henry! Oh, Henry!

1018
01:27:19,868 --> 01:27:21,901
<i>Dear Mr. Gates,</i>

1019
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:24,202

my psychological assessment</i>

1020
01:27:24,204 --> 01:27:26,138
<i>and mental status examination</i>

1021
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:29,174
<i>of Mrs. Sarah Lockwood
Winchester.</i>

1022
01:27:29,176 --> 01:27:32,244
<i>It was conducted at her home

1023
01:27:32,246 --> 01:27:35,180
<i>to April 19, 1906,</i>

1024
01:27:35,182 --> 01:27:36,715

1025

Arms Company.</i>

1026
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:41,053
<i>In my professional opinion,</i>

1027
01:27:41,055 --> 01:27:43,022
<i>after having observed
Mrs. Winchester</i>

1028
01:27:43,024 --> 01:27:44,189
<i>for the past week,</i>

1029
01:27:44,191 --> 01:27:47,994
<i>it is my conclusion that

1030
01:27:47,996 --> 01:27:49,995
<i>and is fit to continue
in her role</i>

1031
01:27:49,997 --> 01:27:52,764
<i>with the Winchester
Repeating Arms Company</i>

1032
01:27:52,766 --> 01:27:55,236
<i>for as long as

1033
01:28:00,273 --> 01:28:03,177
<i>Yours truly,
Dr. Eric A. Price.</i>

1034
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:23,599
It's time for us both
to leave this house.

1035
01:28:26,667 --> 01:28:28,036
I'll always miss you.

1036
01:28:44,085 --> 01:28:47,652
Thank you, Dr. Price,
for your help.

1037
01:28:47,654 --> 01:28:48,990
Young man.

1038
01:28:52,326 --> 01:28:53,662
Thank you.

1039
01:29:07,774 --> 01:29:08,976
Time for me to say goodbye.

1040
01:29:18,619 --> 01:29:20,087
Ruby loves you.

1041
01:29:21,655 --> 01:29:23,859
That did not stop
after her death.

1042
01:29:24,691 --> 01:29:26,595
You know that, don't you?

1043
01:29:27,996 --> 01:29:29,096
I do.

1044
01:29:34,969 --> 01:29:36,904
You know,
in spite of everything,

1045
01:29:38,773 --> 01:29:41,271
you really do have
a beautiful home.

1046
01:29:41,273 --> 01:29:42,877
What are you going to do next?

1047
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:45,981
Rebuild, of course.

1048
01:29:48,048 --> 01:29:49,250
Of course.
