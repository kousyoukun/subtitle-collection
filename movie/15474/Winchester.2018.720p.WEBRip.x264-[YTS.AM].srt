2
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:02,266
Henry?

3
00:03:08,998 --> 00:03:10,167
Henry.

4
00:03:13,831 --> 00:03:15,132
Henry.

5
00:03:24,432 --> 00:03:26,067
Henry?

6
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:34,099
Darling, what is it?

7
00:03:36,232 --> 00:03:38,099
What are you doing?

8
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:12,166
He's coming for us.

9
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:49,131
I couldn't move.

10
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:52,732
I started shaking.
I was getting dizzy.

11
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:58,232
I was sure everyone
in the room wanted to kill me.

12
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:09,266
I've never been so scared.

13
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:27,030
Pointless in the end though,
fear, isn't it?

14
00:05:29,298 --> 00:05:31,700
That's your best advice, doc?

15
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,700
All right.

16
00:05:40,698 --> 00:05:43,100
What do you think
controls you?

17
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:47,362
Your body or your mind?

18
00:05:47,364 --> 00:05:49,365
Your money controls me, sugar.

19
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:53,397
Ah, there you go.

20
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,964
- Fine.
- Okay, okay.

21
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:58,131
I think my body and mind
control each other.

22
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:00,200
Well, let's find out.

23
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,130
Is this real?

24
00:06:02,132 --> 00:06:03,330
Yes.

25
00:06:03,332 --> 00:06:04,932
- Yes?
- Yes.

26
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,131
The mind

27
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:10,298
is incredibly creative.

28
00:06:11,365 --> 00:06:13,298
It can make us see situations

29
00:06:14,297 --> 00:06:17,633
that appear completely real,

30
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:20,897
but are in fact

31
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:24,130
nothing more than illusions,

32
00:06:24,132 --> 00:06:27,897
perceptions of truth.

33
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:30,099
How did you do that?

34
00:06:32,432 --> 00:06:35,863
Sometimes we all need
a little help

35
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:39,166
to see the difference
between reality and illusion.

36
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:43,864
And that's
about taking control,

37
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:48,963
about not letting fear
control you.

38
00:06:48,965 --> 00:06:53,365
Because fear in the end
only exists in your mind.

39
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:58,700
All right.
Sorry to say good night.

40
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:04,997
I'm looking for Dr. Price.

41
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:09,764
- Good night.
- I'm Arthur Gates,

42
00:07:09,766 --> 00:07:13,131
Chief Legal Officer of the
Winchester Repeating Arms Company.

43
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,196
Really?

44
00:07:14,198 --> 00:07:15,964
See you
next week, sugar.

45
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:17,600
You're a hard man to reach,
Dr. Price.

46
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:21,063
Good night, Nancy.

47
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,332
- Good night.
- Good night.

48
00:07:24,165 --> 00:07:25,332
I'm on sabbatical.

49
00:07:26,232 --> 00:07:28,000
Good night.

50
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:31,330
What do you want?
A prescription?

51
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:33,666
I've come to offer
you employment.

52
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:37,664
- Whiskey?
- No, thank you.

53
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,896
Are you familiar with Sarah
Winchester, Dr. Price?

54
00:07:40,898 --> 00:07:43,396
Mrs. Winchester's
husband William

55
00:07:43,398 --> 00:07:44,930
was the majority shareholder

56
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:48,330
of the Winchester
Repeating Arms Company.

57
00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:50,163
Twenty-five years ago,
William passed,

58
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:53,133
leaving Mrs. Winchester
a rather large inheritance,

59
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:56,697
and 51% of the company.

60
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,332
Mrs. Winchester also lost
her only child, Annie.

61
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:03,897
It's said in her grief,

62
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:08,262
she turned to a medium...
Spiritualist of some sort.

63
00:08:08,264 --> 00:08:12,096
The medium may have taken
advantage of her mental state.

64
00:08:12,098 --> 00:08:14,730
That's not uncommon
after a tragedy.

65
00:08:14,732 --> 00:08:15,897
I can assure you,

66
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:19,633
Sarah Winchester
is anything but common.

67
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,296
Aye, after her spiritual
encounter,

68
00:08:22,298 --> 00:08:24,929
she moved across the country
to San Jose,

69
00:08:24,931 --> 00:08:26,696
- where she purchased what...
- Where's my...

70
00:08:26,698 --> 00:08:29,096
Was then
an eight-room house.

71
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:30,063
Maybe it's in
the garden room.

72
00:08:30,065 --> 00:08:32,830
She spent the last 20 years
expanding it.

73
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:36,430
What stands now is

74
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,064
a gargantuan seven
storied structure,

75
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:41,129
with no apparent
rhyme or reason,

76
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:42,196
no master plan,

77
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:47,295
each maze of halls
more confusing than the next.

78
00:08:47,297 --> 00:08:49,963
A house under
never-ending construction,

79
00:08:49,965 --> 00:08:52,664
built on the orders
of a grieving widow

80
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:56,296
whose mind is as chaotic
as the house itself.

81
00:08:56,298 --> 00:08:59,764
Over the years, she's become
more and more reclusive.

82
00:08:59,766 --> 00:09:02,031
Last month,
the Board of Directors

83
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:03,429
enacted its right to assess

84
00:09:03,431 --> 00:09:05,797
Mrs. Winchester's
state of mind,

85
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:09,830
to determine if she's fit
to control the company.

86
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:13,230
You want to take it
away from her?

87
00:09:13,232 --> 00:09:15,366
We're worried about
her sanity, Dr. Price.

88
00:09:17,898 --> 00:09:19,932
We need a professional.

89
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:22,764
Any kind of diagnosis

90
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:25,397
from such a long distance
would be impossible.

91
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,295
Well, Mrs. Winchester's agreed

92
00:09:27,297 --> 00:09:29,196
to let you stay
at the residence.

93
00:09:29,198 --> 00:09:31,966
An offer
that is exceedingly rare.

94
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,295
An unwilling patient,
the long distance.

95
00:09:36,297 --> 00:09:38,397
This is not
something ordinarily I...

96
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,663
Name the amount.

97
00:09:39,665 --> 00:09:40,796
Doesn't really work like that.

98
00:09:40,798 --> 00:09:41,899
How much do you owe?

99
00:09:43,432 --> 00:09:44,964
Mortgage?

100
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:46,700
Hospital expenses?

101
00:09:48,164 --> 00:09:49,265
Medicine?

102
00:09:50,398 --> 00:09:51,697
Three hundred.

103
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:53,032
We'll pay six.

104
00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:55,732
For the appropriate assessment.

105
00:10:45,198 --> 00:10:47,897
Mrs. Winchester
requests the bay window frame

106
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:49,730
be installed by sundown.

107
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,866
Move with haste.

108
00:11:01,264 --> 00:11:02,265
Let me get that, sir.

109
00:11:03,264 --> 00:11:04,733
Thank you.

110
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:11,796
Busy day
of construction here, sir.

111
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:12,863
- Yes.
- Days and nights

112
00:11:12,865 --> 00:11:14,096
are always busy here.

113
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:16,162
Really? Nights, too?

114
00:11:16,164 --> 00:11:18,130
Right round
the clock, sir.

115
00:11:18,132 --> 00:11:18,999
This way.

116
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:24,330
Most of the rooms
don't stay up very long,

117
00:11:24,332 --> 00:11:27,262
like Mrs. Winchester's
garden room there.

118
00:11:27,264 --> 00:11:29,663
That might not
last the season.

119
00:11:29,665 --> 00:11:30,830
Really?

120
00:11:30,832 --> 00:11:33,362
Check the measurements
here have been done.

121
00:11:33,364 --> 00:11:35,729
Please wait
in the library, sir.

122
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:38,266
I'll call for Mrs. Marriott.

123
00:12:34,831 --> 00:12:36,696
- Jesus!
- My apologies, sir.

124
00:12:36,698 --> 00:12:38,829
The door was making
a terrible racket.

125
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:39,995
No, no, no, no, no.

126
00:12:39,997 --> 00:12:41,963
That's quite all right.

127
00:12:41,965 --> 00:12:43,166
Gave me a fright.

128
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,862
Dr. Price?

129
00:12:52,864 --> 00:12:54,163
- Yes.
- Welcome.

130
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:56,430
Marion Marriott,
Mrs. Winchester's niece.

131
00:12:56,432 --> 00:12:59,163
Oh. Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

132
00:12:59,165 --> 00:13:03,796
I must say, I have never
quite seen a house like this.

133
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:06,963
My aunt advised me
of the nature of your visit.

134
00:13:06,965 --> 00:13:08,764
As you are aware,
it is unfortunate timing,

135
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:10,095
so I would ask you
to behave in a manner

136
00:13:10,097 --> 00:13:11,862
befitting the circumstance.

137
00:13:11,864 --> 00:13:13,396
Unfortunate, how?

138
00:13:13,398 --> 00:13:14,699
A tragedy occurred.

139
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:16,262
Oh.

140
00:13:16,264 --> 00:13:17,764
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

141
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:19,366
Are you carrying firearms?

142
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,696
Should I be?

143
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:22,995
Aunt Sarah forbids them.

144
00:13:22,997 --> 00:13:24,995
Well.

145
00:13:24,997 --> 00:13:27,262
I'm completely unarmed.

146
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:30,030
Good. You, like I,
like everyone,

147
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:31,396
are guests
in Aunt Sarah's home.

148
00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:33,196
You will abide
by her rules.

149
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:34,462
Understood.

150
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:36,697
You are to stay in this section
of the house, the east wing.

151
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:38,797
Aunt Sarah's private domains
are off limits.

152
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:39,799
Understood.

153
00:13:40,731 --> 00:13:42,230
So...

154
00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:44,162
Are you close to your aunt?

155
00:13:44,164 --> 00:13:46,195
Is this already part of
your evaluation, Dr. Price?

156
00:13:46,197 --> 00:13:48,098
No, ma'am,
it is not.

157
00:13:48,732 --> 00:13:49,963
Yes.

158
00:13:49,965 --> 00:13:51,429
Aunt Sarah
is an exceptional woman.

159
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:52,796
She does not deserve
to be treated

160
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,799
with anything less
than complete respect.

161
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,199
Yes, ma'am. Quite right.

162
00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:04,965
May I?

163
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:10,729
This is the grand ballroom,

164
00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:12,764
built almost entirely
without nails.

165
00:14:12,766 --> 00:14:16,330
The walls and parquet floor are
made of six separate hard woods.

166
00:14:16,332 --> 00:14:18,899
The silver chandelier
was imported from Germany.

167
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,928
Follow me, Doctor.

168
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,862
There are almost one hundred
rooms in the house.

169
00:14:28,864 --> 00:14:30,365
It's easy to get lost.

170
00:15:02,164 --> 00:15:05,296
How unusual.

171
00:15:05,298 --> 00:15:07,095
Aunt Sarah
suffers from arthritis.

172
00:15:07,097 --> 00:15:10,029
This makes climbing stairs
manageable for her.

173
00:15:10,031 --> 00:15:12,332
The house can be overwhelming.
Do keep up.

174
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:20,365
What is this?

175
00:15:21,898 --> 00:15:23,166
It's a communication device.

176
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,397
Really?

177
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,429
You speak into the holes,
and a series of pipes

178
00:15:27,431 --> 00:15:29,366
travel the sound
to the desired room.

179
00:15:36,398 --> 00:15:37,830
- Ingenious.
- Yes.

180
00:15:37,832 --> 00:15:40,695
You'll find many of my aunt's
inventions are state of the art.

181
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:43,296
I trust you'll find everything
you need with the room.

182
00:15:43,298 --> 00:15:46,130
Aunt Sarah will be
joining us for dinner.

183
00:15:46,132 --> 00:15:48,928
Perhaps you would like
to freshen up beforehand.

184
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,931
I very much look forward
to meeting your aunt.

185
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,196
Aunt Sarah
would not approve of you

186
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:54,198
drinking before dinner hour.

187
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:58,165
Her sense of smell
is still as acute as mine.

188
00:15:59,797 --> 00:16:01,065
Respect her wishes.

189
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,699
You were right about me, Ruby.

190
00:16:18,797 --> 00:16:20,099
I am

191
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,231
a fraud.

192
00:16:40,698 --> 00:16:43,298
You're a phony, hmm?

193
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:48,332
That feels good.

194
00:16:53,432 --> 00:16:56,729
Well, you don't know
what you're doing.

195
00:17:01,097 --> 00:17:03,063
You don't know
what you're doing.

196
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:06,299
Oh, yeah. You prove nothing.

197
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,998
For Christ's sake.

198
00:17:18,697 --> 00:17:20,664
Jesus Christ!

199
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,799
Ah!

200
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,430
Who are you?
What do you want?

201
00:18:07,432 --> 00:18:10,696
Dinner will be served
in 10 minutes.

202
00:18:10,698 --> 00:18:13,362
- You're alone, yes?
- Yes, sir.

203
00:18:13,364 --> 00:18:15,262
- Nobody else with you?
- No, sir.

204
00:18:15,264 --> 00:18:17,796
No? You didn't see anyone
just come out of here?

205
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:18,932
Are you all right, sir?

206
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:23,762
I'm fine. I just thought
someone else was...

207
00:18:23,764 --> 00:18:25,698
Well, I thought I saw
someone else in my room.

208
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:28,795
Interesting.

209
00:18:28,797 --> 00:18:30,295
Look, I'm fine, yes.

210
00:18:30,297 --> 00:18:31,963
Dinner in 10 minutes, yes?

211
00:18:31,965 --> 00:18:33,999
- Sir.
- Good, thank you.

212
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:42,966
Take it nice and easy.

213
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:46,366
There.

214
00:19:03,697 --> 00:19:04,931
Henry.

215
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:06,865
Stop it.

216
00:19:16,264 --> 00:19:17,332
Henry, stop that!

217
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:22,999
Henry. Henry! Just...

218
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:27,397
Henry, you must be
very excited

219
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,966
to spend some time
in your great aunt's house.

220
00:19:31,297 --> 00:19:33,698
We're here
because Father died.

221
00:19:36,964 --> 00:19:39,928
Well, I am very sorry
for your loss, young man.

222
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,129
- I'm not.
- Henry!

223
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:45,728
It's my fault.
I didn't mean to pry.

224
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,966
Of course, you did.
That's why you're here.

225
00:19:49,297 --> 00:19:52,663
Yes. Suppose so.

226
00:19:52,665 --> 00:19:54,796
I recently lost
someone myself.

227
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:56,795
So if you feel like
discussing anything,

228
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:59,030
I might be able
to provide some assistance

229
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,598
to yourself
or young Henry here.

230
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:05,429
I imagine you must be
very good at your job

231
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:08,099
if Aunt Sarah chose you
to be her assessor.

232
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:13,763
I had no idea
she chose me herself.

233
00:20:13,765 --> 00:20:15,763
I'm just hoping I can help.

234
00:20:15,765 --> 00:20:17,263
If you want to help, Doctor,

235
00:20:17,265 --> 00:20:18,862
you can give my aunt
a clean bill of health

236
00:20:18,864 --> 00:20:20,962
and be on your way.

237
00:20:20,964 --> 00:20:22,796
Well, I have a duty
to my profession

238
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:24,931
and an obligation
to my employers.

239
00:20:26,698 --> 00:20:28,299
Aunt Sarah is your employer.

240
00:20:29,665 --> 00:20:31,266
It is still half her company.

241
00:20:47,198 --> 00:20:49,065
- Madam.
- Good evening, Madam.

242
00:20:52,664 --> 00:20:54,231
Good evening, Madam.

243
00:21:29,098 --> 00:21:30,296
Dr. Price.

244
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:33,063
Mrs. Winchester, it's a
pleasure to finally meet you.

245
00:21:33,065 --> 00:21:34,428
The pleasure is due
to the lawyers

246
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,198
of the Winchester
Repeating Arms Company.

247
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:40,296
Yes.

248
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:42,995
I suppose you're right.

249
00:21:42,997 --> 00:21:45,862
I hope everything has been
to your satisfaction so far?

250
00:21:45,864 --> 00:21:47,996
I cannot fault
the hospitality.

251
00:21:47,998 --> 00:21:51,166
It's quite a special house,
is it not?

252
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,665
Now that, ma'am,
is a fact beyond dispute.

253
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,232
Thank you.

254
00:22:01,097 --> 00:22:03,329
I understand the Winchester
is still considered

255
00:22:03,331 --> 00:22:05,995
the superior rifle
on the market, ma'am.

256
00:22:05,997 --> 00:22:07,265
Superior?

257
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,364
Superior at what?

258
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,663
Accuracy, range,
stopping power.

259
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:16,096
Killing.

260
00:22:16,098 --> 00:22:17,999
Indiscriminate killing.

261
00:22:19,132 --> 00:22:20,996
Very superior.

262
00:22:20,998 --> 00:22:25,096
You feel responsible for
the misuse of your product?

263
00:22:25,098 --> 00:22:26,895
If a weapon works
as intended,

264
00:22:26,897 --> 00:22:29,095
one can hardly
call it a misuse.

265
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,263
Well, it can
be used for good or bad,

266
00:22:31,265 --> 00:22:33,166
depending on the person
wielding it.

267
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:38,328
Yes.

268
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:42,329
Then again, perhaps roller skates
are a less dangerous endeavor.

269
00:22:42,331 --> 00:22:43,863
The company is expanding,

270
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:45,929
looking for other
opportunities.

271
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,262
I understand that was at
your behest, Mrs. Winchester?

272
00:22:48,264 --> 00:22:49,329
It was.

273
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:51,294
To the displeasure
of the board.

274
00:22:51,296 --> 00:22:53,896
It appears that strapping
wheels to one's feet

275
00:22:53,898 --> 00:22:57,199
can also be a
perilous endeavor.

276
00:22:59,765 --> 00:23:00,865
Hear, hear.

277
00:23:20,864 --> 00:23:23,663
<i>Tell me the story
about the farmer</i>

278
00:23:23,665 --> 00:23:25,828
- <i>who owned the old mule.</i>
- <i>No.</i>

279
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,098
<i>I always liked that story.</i>

280
00:23:29,097 --> 00:23:31,695
<i>A delusional disorder.</i>

281
00:23:31,697 --> 00:23:33,163
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>That's what you called it.</i>

282
00:23:33,165 --> 00:23:34,429
<i>Yes.</i>

283
00:23:34,431 --> 00:23:35,962
<i>I don't want to talk anymore.</i>

284
00:23:35,964 --> 00:23:38,095
<i>I need you to believe me.</i>

285
00:23:38,097 --> 00:23:42,195
<i>I want to be with you, Ruby.
Together forever.</i>

286
00:24:11,697 --> 00:24:13,098
Hello?

287
00:24:26,864 --> 00:24:27,998
Hello?

288
00:27:03,063 --> 00:27:04,695
Christ!

289
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:12,095
You've poisoned
your mind, Eric.

290
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:14,194
You've poisoned your mind.

291
00:27:14,196 --> 00:27:16,028
I need some air.

292
00:28:38,164 --> 00:28:39,265
Deja vu.

293
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,297
Hey!

294
00:30:14,296 --> 00:30:15,930
Hey!

295
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,231
Move, hey! Move! Move!

296
00:30:26,731 --> 00:30:28,332
I see you.

297
00:30:33,897 --> 00:30:36,231
Oh, Henry! Darling!

298
00:30:39,264 --> 00:30:41,031
What's happening
to you, sweetheart?

299
00:30:46,397 --> 00:30:47,598
Thank you.

300
00:30:52,363 --> 00:30:54,297
Darling,
what's happening to you?

301
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,861
Mrs. Winchester,

302
00:31:01,863 --> 00:31:03,795
I really must have
your full attention.

303
00:31:03,797 --> 00:31:05,295
Oh, you have it, Dr. Price.

304
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:08,295
Yes, but perhaps you would
be more comfortable if...

305
00:31:08,297 --> 00:31:11,061
Last night was quite
a traumatic event.

306
00:31:11,063 --> 00:31:13,361
I'm grateful for your actions.

307
00:31:13,363 --> 00:31:15,395
I fear you may
have me at a...

308
00:31:15,397 --> 00:31:17,894
An emotional
disadvantage today.

309
00:31:17,896 --> 00:31:19,696
Yes, I understand.

310
00:31:19,698 --> 00:31:21,895
I don't mean to pry,
but has Master Henry

311
00:31:21,897 --> 00:31:23,798
been prone to sleepwalking
in the past?

312
00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:26,827
No.

313
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:28,262
But you may know,
he did witness

314
00:31:28,264 --> 00:31:29,732
the death of his father.

315
00:31:30,197 --> 00:31:31,197
Yes.

316
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:34,894
Well, this is the first

317
00:31:34,896 --> 00:31:37,028
in a series of sessions
I wish to conduct.

318
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,828
And I can assure you that
today will be quite benign.

319
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:42,095
No, no, no. Let's just
get straight to it, Doctor.

320
00:31:42,097 --> 00:31:44,728
You are here to assess
my erratic behavior,

321
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:45,662
are you not?

322
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,396
Well, erratic behavior
is not the phrase

323
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:48,895
that I would've
chosen, but...

324
00:31:48,897 --> 00:31:51,162
- Now, I'll speak with you truthfully.
- Please.

325
00:31:51,164 --> 00:31:53,328
But you will do me
the same courtesy.

326
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,795
Of course.

327
00:31:54,797 --> 00:31:56,797
Do you suffer
from soldier's syndrome?

328
00:31:57,264 --> 00:31:58,662
I'm sorry?

329
00:31:58,664 --> 00:32:01,994
Are you an abuser
of medication?

330
00:32:01,996 --> 00:32:04,229
Mrs. Winchester, I think it's
best if I ask the questions.

331
00:32:04,231 --> 00:32:07,361
Your wife, did she believe
you are a good therapist?

332
00:32:07,363 --> 00:32:08,962
We're not here
to discuss my wife.

333
00:32:08,964 --> 00:32:10,665
Your wife Ruby?

334
00:32:13,397 --> 00:32:14,795
No, we are not.

335
00:32:14,797 --> 00:32:16,895
And I would appreciate
your honesty.

336
00:32:16,897 --> 00:32:18,262
Are you an abuser
of medication?

337
00:32:18,264 --> 00:32:19,763
No, I'm not.

338
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,262
- So...
- I will share a fact with you,

339
00:32:28,264 --> 00:32:29,861
which you may
find questionable.

340
00:32:29,863 --> 00:32:32,128
But I assure you,
it is a fact.

341
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,130
Please.

342
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,265
I am cursed.

343
00:32:35,963 --> 00:32:37,396
Cursed, how?

344
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:38,994
Have you read my papers?

345
00:32:38,996 --> 00:32:40,761
- Of course, I have.
- And what did they say?

346
00:32:40,763 --> 00:32:41,895
Well, among many things,

347
00:32:41,897 --> 00:32:44,262
they say that this is
the house that spirits built.

348
00:32:44,264 --> 00:32:47,764
See, profiting from such
a thing as violence and death,

349
00:32:50,297 --> 00:32:54,094
that is a wickedness that
follows you like a shadow.

350
00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:57,262
Yes, we might also call
those shadows "guilt."

351
00:32:57,264 --> 00:32:59,962
But tell me, how do these
shadows follow you?

352
00:32:59,964 --> 00:33:01,328
I may be getting old,
Dr. Price,

353
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,727
but I assure you,
I have not lost my senses.

354
00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:07,631
I know the difference
between illusion and reality.

355
00:33:08,296 --> 00:33:09,697
I see.

356
00:33:12,397 --> 00:33:15,895
Your mind rules your body.

357
00:33:15,897 --> 00:33:18,061
The mind
can be incredibly creative.

358
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:22,062
But it can also,
at times, fail us.

359
00:33:22,064 --> 00:33:24,294
My mind has never failed me.

360
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:27,994
What we see, taste, and touch

361
00:33:27,996 --> 00:33:31,028
are interpreted and processed
to give us our truth.

362
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:34,094
And that truth can in turn
be an illusion,

363
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:39,064
created, distorted, by grief.

364
00:33:42,131 --> 00:33:44,298
Do you believe in ghosts,
Dr. Price?

365
00:33:45,264 --> 00:33:47,827
No, ma'am. Why would I?

366
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:50,961
Offering my staff that bill
would be greatly appreciated.

367
00:33:50,963 --> 00:33:52,727
Even the nickel
inside the bill

368
00:33:52,729 --> 00:33:54,930
would be a respectable start.

369
00:33:56,363 --> 00:33:59,062
Really! Silly illusions?

370
00:33:59,064 --> 00:34:00,695
Do you take me for a fool?

371
00:34:00,697 --> 00:34:01,995
No, ma'am. I do not.

372
00:34:01,997 --> 00:34:03,428
No more diversions
from reality.

373
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,162
No more parlor tricks.

374
00:34:05,164 --> 00:34:07,262
And your medication
will have to be confiscated.

375
00:34:07,264 --> 00:34:09,962
Mrs. Winchester, I'm sorry, but I
must insist, I'm not a child...

376
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,029
- This is my home, Dr. Price.
- And I will not be...

377
00:34:12,031 --> 00:34:13,931
You will obey my rules.

378
00:34:15,164 --> 00:34:17,328
If you want me to open up
this house for you,

379
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,964
you need clarity.

380
00:34:22,763 --> 00:34:24,630
Do you have another
question for me?

381
00:34:26,797 --> 00:34:27,798
Yes, ma'am.

382
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:35,396
Is it really necessary
to confine me to quarters?

383
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:36,997
That is Madam's wish, sir.

384
00:34:38,331 --> 00:34:40,128
Hmm.

385
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,928
And the condition
of Master Henry?

386
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:44,728
He too is confined
to quarters.

387
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,164
And Mrs. Marriott
has not left his side.

388
00:35:16,663 --> 00:35:17,965
Damn it!

389
00:35:30,997 --> 00:35:34,161
"Sir, the members of the board
eagerly await your evaluation.

390
00:35:34,163 --> 00:35:36,195
"I trust you will make
an accurate assessment.

391
00:35:36,197 --> 00:35:38,698
"Regards, Arthur C. Gates,
Chief Legal Officer."

392
00:35:50,863 --> 00:35:53,062
<i>Sarah Winchester's
psychological assessment</i>

393
00:35:53,064 --> 00:35:55,361
<i>and mental status
examination.</i>

394
00:35:55,363 --> 00:35:58,797
<i>Dr. Eric A. Price,
April 16, 1906.</i>

395
00:36:00,264 --> 00:36:02,194
<i>Appearance, normal.</i>

396
00:36:02,196 --> 00:36:05,228
<i>Hygiene, physical
characteristics, all normal.</i>

397
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,695
<i>Patient struggles with the
loss of her husband and child.</i>

398
00:36:08,697 --> 00:36:11,095
<i>Her behavior is at times
slightly aggressive.</i>

399
00:36:11,097 --> 00:36:13,762
<i>Perception,
visual hallucinations</i>

400
00:36:13,764 --> 00:36:17,198
<i>that patient often refers to
as shadows or ghosts.</i>

401
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:22,130
I feel them, their presence.

402
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,064
Go on.

403
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:39,694
I feel their presence,
their energy.

404
00:36:39,696 --> 00:36:43,694
<i>Their unfinished business
has brought them here.</i>

405
00:36:43,696 --> 00:36:45,661
Do you perhaps
in any way blame them

406
00:36:45,663 --> 00:36:48,194
for the death
of your husband and child?

407
00:36:48,196 --> 00:36:52,727
I will mourn William
and dear Annie always.

408
00:36:52,729 --> 00:36:55,362
I love all my family
very much, Dr. Price.

409
00:36:55,364 --> 00:36:58,162
They are the true
riches of my life,

410
00:36:58,164 --> 00:37:01,727
and I will do whatever
it takes to protect them.

411
00:37:15,697 --> 00:37:17,029
Can you tell me why the...

412
00:37:17,031 --> 00:37:18,998
Why those bells
chime at midnight?

413
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,065
It's midnight, sir.

414
00:37:21,897 --> 00:37:24,362
Well, yes.

415
00:37:24,364 --> 00:37:25,931
But is there
any significance to it?

416
00:37:27,231 --> 00:37:28,698
It's midnight, sir.

417
00:37:32,097 --> 00:37:33,098
Thank you.

418
00:40:55,897 --> 00:40:59,028
I swear, the laudanum
is still in my system.

419
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:03,327
Let's just hope
it's withdrawals.

420
00:41:03,329 --> 00:41:07,131
It always was withdrawals.
It had to be. Had to be.

421
00:41:11,796 --> 00:41:13,928
<i>I have a question
for you, Dr. Price.</i>

422
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,694
Again, Mrs. Winchester,
it's best if I ask...

423
00:41:15,696 --> 00:41:17,293
What is it like to die?

424
00:41:17,295 --> 00:41:18,260
Talking about your...

425
00:41:18,262 --> 00:41:20,930
Deceased for three minutes,
were you not?

426
00:41:25,229 --> 00:41:28,962
You know, I keep records

427
00:41:28,964 --> 00:41:32,160
of all the lives
a Winchester has taken.

428
00:41:32,162 --> 00:41:35,897
Hundreds have been reported.
Probably thousands haven't.

429
00:41:37,196 --> 00:41:39,695
The guilty, the innocent...

430
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:41,827
The rifle doesn't discriminate.

431
00:41:41,829 --> 00:41:45,193
And many of the souls
make their way to this house.

432
00:41:45,195 --> 00:41:47,327
That's impressive.

433
00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:49,094
As you can clearly see,
I am still here.

434
00:41:49,096 --> 00:41:51,261
So perhaps you could do me

435
00:41:51,263 --> 00:41:53,698
the kindness of taking me
off that shelf.

436
00:41:54,396 --> 00:41:55,730
You were shot.

437
00:41:56,031 --> 00:41:57,031
I was.

438
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,197
This.

439
00:42:06,397 --> 00:42:08,663
And it did kill me.

440
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:16,631
You kept it and refurbished it.

441
00:42:17,262 --> 00:42:19,762
- I did.
- Why?

442
00:42:19,764 --> 00:42:22,795
Well, because
it's a reminder of my past.

443
00:42:22,797 --> 00:42:25,029
Because it's my
connection to death

444
00:42:25,031 --> 00:42:26,697
and to all that I've lost.

445
00:42:28,896 --> 00:42:30,128
Instruments of death

446
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,662
have a powerful connection
to the afterlife.

447
00:42:36,729 --> 00:42:39,062
We hold on to mementos
to help us heal.

448
00:42:39,064 --> 00:42:41,930
But sometimes,
they do more harm than good.

449
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:43,695
Precisely.

450
00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:47,164
So tell me, what do you think
it is you're holding on to?

451
00:42:51,062 --> 00:42:52,897
Have you ever been
to a spiritualist?

452
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,694
But I understand you have.

453
00:42:56,696 --> 00:42:57,862
You know, it is believed

454
00:42:57,864 --> 00:42:59,762
that once we've departed
this world,

455
00:42:59,764 --> 00:43:01,662
we can see others

456
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:04,094
who have left
their physical selves behind.

457
00:43:04,096 --> 00:43:05,029
Is that right?

458
00:43:05,031 --> 00:43:07,798
Have you ever
experienced such a thing?

459
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:10,731
I can't say that I have, no.

460
00:43:11,263 --> 00:43:13,360
Is it painful to die?

461
00:43:13,362 --> 00:43:14,394
Mrs. Winchester,

462
00:43:14,396 --> 00:43:16,395
we really must continue
with this evaluation.

463
00:43:16,397 --> 00:43:18,962
Please, Doctor. Please.

464
00:43:18,964 --> 00:43:20,331
Yes.

465
00:43:23,129 --> 00:43:24,764
And then nothing.

466
00:43:26,429 --> 00:43:28,096
Just a calmness.

467
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:32,831
And when I came back,
it was painful again.

468
00:43:34,897 --> 00:43:36,130
If that makes sense.

469
00:43:36,663 --> 00:43:37,664
Yes.

470
00:43:41,664 --> 00:43:45,194
Yes, because you too
have experienced great pain.

471
00:43:45,196 --> 00:43:49,027
Grief can be far
more crippling

472
00:43:49,029 --> 00:43:50,664
than arthritis, Doctor.

473
00:43:51,697 --> 00:43:53,427
Mrs. Winchester,
do you blame the shadows

474
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:55,964
for the loss of your
husband and child?

475
00:43:57,929 --> 00:44:00,196
Were you out of your room
last night?

476
00:44:04,995 --> 00:44:06,630
Yes, I was.

477
00:44:07,296 --> 00:44:08,861
Thank you.

478
00:44:08,863 --> 00:44:11,263
Thank you
for telling me the truth.

479
00:44:22,295 --> 00:44:26,160
So, why all the noise?
Why all this construction?

480
00:44:26,162 --> 00:44:28,827
They want me
to build, Doctor.

481
00:44:28,829 --> 00:44:32,694
The spirits killed
by the rifle,

482
00:44:32,696 --> 00:44:34,661
they guide me.

483
00:44:34,663 --> 00:44:37,160
Guide you in drawing
building plans?

484
00:44:37,162 --> 00:44:38,297
Yes.

485
00:44:39,996 --> 00:44:41,395
For what? Why?

486
00:44:41,397 --> 00:44:43,428
For the rooms, of course.

487
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,761
You see, once their rooms
are completed,

488
00:44:45,763 --> 00:44:47,763
their presence grows stronger.

489
00:44:49,163 --> 00:44:51,030
Hence, the house
that spirits built?

490
00:44:51,329 --> 00:44:52,363
Yes.

491
00:44:53,195 --> 00:44:55,260
The shadows that follow me,

492
00:44:55,262 --> 00:44:57,794
they have unfinished business.

493
00:44:57,796 --> 00:45:00,630
You saw what I did last night,
didn't you?

494
00:45:01,196 --> 00:45:02,197
I did.

495
00:45:04,229 --> 00:45:06,164
At the chime of midnight,
they clamor.

496
00:45:07,263 --> 00:45:10,328
<i>The bells summon them.</i>

497
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:15,294
They communicate
through plans, drawings.

498
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:19,160
<i>They want me to reconstruct
the rooms that they died in,</i>

499
00:45:19,162 --> 00:45:22,728
then they can enter our world.

500
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:24,160
And the trouble is,
I don't always know

501
00:45:24,162 --> 00:45:25,795
who it is I'm speaking with.

502
00:45:25,797 --> 00:45:28,330
It could be some
innocent bystander

503
00:45:29,362 --> 00:45:32,330
<i>or a victim of a crime,</i>

504
00:45:34,996 --> 00:45:36,862
or someone else.

505
00:45:36,864 --> 00:45:38,364
Who else, Mrs. Winchester?

506
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:43,027
<i>Last night,
a spirit more powerful</i>

507
00:45:43,029 --> 00:45:47,230
<i>than any I've encountered
endangered my family.</i>

508
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:50,731
Who are you?

509
00:45:52,397 --> 00:45:57,164
Doctor, who do you see
in this room at this moment?

510
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,263
Just you.

511
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:02,130
Only me?

512
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:12,197
Just you.

513
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,395
It will take time.

514
00:46:16,397 --> 00:46:18,297
You still need to clear
your head.

515
00:46:38,663 --> 00:46:40,093
Oh, sir!

516
00:46:40,095 --> 00:46:41,094
I would like to check in

517
00:46:41,096 --> 00:46:43,694
on Mrs. Marriott
and Master Henry, if I may.

518
00:46:43,696 --> 00:46:45,661
I will inquire, sir.

519
00:46:45,663 --> 00:46:47,797
Perhaps, may I
ask you a question?

520
00:46:48,963 --> 00:46:50,027
A question, sir?

521
00:46:50,029 --> 00:46:52,896
Yes. I mean, tell me,
have you ever seen any...

522
00:46:53,729 --> 00:46:55,097
Any ghosts?

523
00:46:55,696 --> 00:46:56,963
No, sir.

524
00:46:58,262 --> 00:47:01,261
But you have heard
the rumors, the stories?

525
00:47:01,263 --> 00:47:04,794
I have heard tall tales.

526
00:47:04,796 --> 00:47:07,794
Some taller than others.

527
00:47:07,796 --> 00:47:10,330
Have you ever witnessed
anything out of the ordinary?

528
00:47:18,329 --> 00:47:21,127
So display cabinets
along the walls,

529
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,263
and then a line of them
down the middle of the room.

530
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:25,494
Yes, ma'am.

531
00:47:25,496 --> 00:47:28,996
And what type of Winchester
would you like delivered?

532
00:47:31,095 --> 00:47:33,862
Every type, every model.

533
00:47:35,862 --> 00:47:38,360
<i>Okay, let's go back.</i>

534
00:47:38,362 --> 00:47:41,694
Tell me please what happens
once these rooms are finished?

535
00:47:41,696 --> 00:47:43,761
Well, the spirit's
presence grows

536
00:47:43,763 --> 00:47:45,761
more powerful and more...

537
00:47:45,763 --> 00:47:47,394
<i>More focused.</i>

538
00:47:47,396 --> 00:47:49,093
<i>Their voices get stronger.</i>

539
00:47:49,095 --> 00:47:50,395
And we converse.

540
00:47:50,397 --> 00:47:53,261
Converse how?
About what?

541
00:47:53,263 --> 00:47:57,228
I show them my deep remorse.

542
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:00,893
I want to help them let go of
their grief and their anger.

543
00:48:00,895 --> 00:48:02,194
And how do they react?

544
00:48:02,196 --> 00:48:05,695
Favorably. Yes, mostly.

545
00:48:05,697 --> 00:48:07,993
Once they are at peace,
then they can move on.

546
00:48:07,995 --> 00:48:11,727
We can tear down their room,
and then we start again.

547
00:48:11,729 --> 00:48:14,663
And are there those that
don't react so favorably?

548
00:48:16,095 --> 00:48:17,894
Yes.

549
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:20,294
Yes, we lock them away.

550
00:48:20,296 --> 00:48:22,328
How does one lock
a spirit away?

551
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:25,161
Thirteen nails seals them in.

552
00:48:25,163 --> 00:48:27,394
<i>Once they find peace,
we can release them,</i>

553
00:48:27,396 --> 00:48:29,294
<i>and they can leave this house.</i>

554
00:48:29,296 --> 00:48:30,861
<i>So 13 is</i>

555
00:48:30,863 --> 00:48:32,861
a devilish number to
protect you from devils?

556
00:48:32,863 --> 00:48:35,726
No, no, no.
That is a divine number,

557
00:48:35,728 --> 00:48:38,294
to protect the cycle
of life and death.

558
00:48:38,296 --> 00:48:40,160
And does this divine number
always work?

559
00:48:40,162 --> 00:48:44,597
I mean, what if a spirit simply
doesn't want to be locked away?

560
00:48:46,096 --> 00:48:48,194
The unmendable souls

561
00:48:48,196 --> 00:48:51,793
prey upon the innocent
and the pure.

562
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:54,597
And by the innocent and pure,
you mean Master Henry?

563
00:48:57,762 --> 00:48:59,363
We can stand between them.

564
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:01,996
I and you.

565
00:49:02,996 --> 00:49:04,727
With your assistance,

566
00:49:04,729 --> 00:49:07,631
I can help this spirit
find peace.

567
00:49:13,062 --> 00:49:15,328
You don't believe any of this.
I understand.

568
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,060
Ma'am, I do not.

569
00:49:17,062 --> 00:49:22,160
I do not believe in anything
I cannot see or study.

570
00:49:22,162 --> 00:49:24,395
Mrs. Winchester,
you have built this house,

571
00:49:24,397 --> 00:49:26,360
this place, this reality.

572
00:49:26,362 --> 00:49:28,762
Therefore, you can control it,
can you not?

573
00:49:29,663 --> 00:49:31,361
Yes, perhaps.

574
00:49:31,363 --> 00:49:32,826
We all have the ability

575
00:49:32,828 --> 00:49:34,993
to create and control
our own reality.

576
00:49:34,995 --> 00:49:38,394
But for some, for you,
Mrs. Winchester, for you,

577
00:49:38,396 --> 00:49:40,229
that will mean letting go
of the past.

578
00:49:41,863 --> 00:49:43,964
Make your assessment, Doctor.

579
00:49:45,962 --> 00:49:50,161
Say what you feel is the truth
about Sarah Winchester.

580
00:49:50,163 --> 00:49:52,630
And if that means you lose
control of your company?

581
00:49:54,162 --> 00:49:57,796
There are worse things in this
world to lose than that, Doctor.

582
00:50:05,095 --> 00:50:06,363
I see you've finished
the new room.

583
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:09,428
Of course.

584
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:11,163
Must be very profitable for you,

585
00:50:12,295 --> 00:50:14,960
all this working
round the clock.

586
00:50:14,962 --> 00:50:16,693
We all appreciate

587
00:50:16,695 --> 00:50:19,694
Mrs. Winchester's
ongoing employment

588
00:50:19,696 --> 00:50:21,297
and her creativity.

589
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:23,694
I must say, that creativity

590
00:50:23,696 --> 00:50:27,194
certainly leads to some
rather odd designs.

591
00:50:27,196 --> 00:50:29,693
Do you think it possible
a woman of advancing years

592
00:50:29,695 --> 00:50:32,360
may be susceptible
to flights of fancy?

593
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:35,029
No, sir. I do not.

594
00:50:38,397 --> 00:50:41,193
Could I see inside
the garden room, please?

595
00:50:41,195 --> 00:50:43,028
I had one similar, and I would
be much obliged if...

596
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:45,230
No, sir. That room is sealed.

597
00:50:46,397 --> 00:50:48,364
Therefore, it's off limits.

598
00:50:49,062 --> 00:50:51,064
Good day, Doctor.

599
00:50:56,263 --> 00:50:58,927
Well, Eric,
that's going really well.

600
00:51:12,996 --> 00:51:14,097
How is he?

601
00:51:15,262 --> 00:51:17,293
Fine. Resting.

602
00:51:17,295 --> 00:51:20,229
Has he ever been prone to
behavior like that in the past?

603
00:51:20,896 --> 00:51:22,127
No.

604
00:51:22,129 --> 00:51:23,196
Never?

605
00:51:26,096 --> 00:51:29,930
She told you, didn't she,
about the Winchester curse?

606
00:51:30,229 --> 00:51:31,926
Yes.

607
00:51:31,928 --> 00:51:34,693
Do you believe her,
or do you think she's crazy?

608
00:51:34,695 --> 00:51:38,027
I think crazy
is a dangerous word.

609
00:51:38,029 --> 00:51:40,194
People have certain
medical conditions

610
00:51:40,196 --> 00:51:42,827
and with the right
diagnosis and treatment,

611
00:51:42,829 --> 00:51:44,230
they can be helped.

612
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:51,096
<i>I do not believe
in curses, Doctor.</i>

613
00:51:51,928 --> 00:51:54,160
<i>Good. Nor do I.</i>

614
00:51:54,162 --> 00:51:56,093
<i>I think perhaps
your son's behavior</i>

615
00:51:56,095 --> 00:51:58,762
<i>has been triggered by the
sudden death of his father.</i>

616
00:51:59,262 --> 00:52:01,093
<i>Yes.</i>

617
00:52:01,095 --> 00:52:03,629
<i>Could you tell me
how your husband died?</i>

618
00:52:04,063 --> 00:52:06,360
He had demons,

619
00:52:06,362 --> 00:52:10,331
but not the kind that my aunt
believes haunt her.

620
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:15,061
<i>Go on.</i>

621
00:52:15,063 --> 00:52:19,093
<i>Aunt Sarah's husband
died suddenly of tuberculosis.</i>

622
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:21,296
<i>And then she lost poor Annie.</i>

623
00:52:22,863 --> 00:52:25,330
<i>She believes our family curse
is spreading.</i>

624
00:52:35,796 --> 00:52:38,261
<i>My husband loved the drink</i>

625
00:52:38,263 --> 00:52:40,761
more than his wife and child.

626
00:52:40,763 --> 00:52:42,697
I believe that was his curse.

627
00:52:44,663 --> 00:52:48,893
Now he is gone, and I'm alone,

628
00:52:48,895 --> 00:52:50,964
better off in so many ways
without him.

629
00:52:52,728 --> 00:52:54,227
But it terrifies me.

630
00:52:54,229 --> 00:52:56,696
Don't let that fear
control you.

631
00:52:57,828 --> 00:53:00,096
Fear only exists in your mind.

632
00:53:01,162 --> 00:53:03,227
When we fear the most,

633
00:53:03,229 --> 00:53:06,160
we must take control.

634
00:53:06,162 --> 00:53:08,893
You can be a fighter.
You can be a protector.

635
00:53:08,895 --> 00:53:10,963
I do not feel like a protector.

636
00:53:12,196 --> 00:53:13,797
Aunt Sarah is the fighter.

637
00:53:15,396 --> 00:53:17,296
- Yes.
- She would die to save us.

638
00:53:18,063 --> 00:53:19,726
Perhaps.

639
00:53:19,728 --> 00:53:22,662
Have you ever loved someone so
much you would die to save them?

640
00:53:24,696 --> 00:53:26,860
I have.

641
00:53:26,862 --> 00:53:32,760
I also knew someone who was
haunted by demons, voices.

642
00:53:32,762 --> 00:53:35,729
And did the time ever come
when you had to protect them?

643
00:53:36,397 --> 00:53:37,897
It did.

644
00:53:39,795 --> 00:53:41,063
What did you do?

645
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,130
I died.

646
00:54:09,863 --> 00:54:10,963
Henry!

647
00:54:12,029 --> 00:54:13,030
Ahh!

648
00:54:17,062 --> 00:54:18,063
Henry.

649
00:54:18,662 --> 00:54:19,726
Henry!

650
00:54:34,928 --> 00:54:36,161
Henry.

651
00:54:36,163 --> 00:54:37,929
Henry! It's me!

652
00:55:05,963 --> 00:55:06,996
No.

653
00:55:07,696 --> 00:55:09,297
Ah!

654
00:55:14,995 --> 00:55:16,963
Henry! Henry!

655
00:55:18,262 --> 00:55:21,662
- Henry! Henry!
- Stop it! Stop!

656
00:55:22,195 --> 00:55:23,359
Stop, Henry, stop!

657
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:25,363
- Who are you?
- Die!

658
00:55:36,995 --> 00:55:38,063
Mother?

659
00:55:39,996 --> 00:55:42,028
Oh, Henry.

660
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:43,796
Henry. Henry.

661
00:55:51,828 --> 00:55:53,127
I'm so sorry, Aunt Sarah.

662
00:55:53,129 --> 00:55:54,794
I've let you down,
and I've let Henry down.

663
00:55:54,796 --> 00:55:57,160
No, no.

664
00:55:57,162 --> 00:56:00,326
This spirit has a power
we've not seen before.

665
00:56:00,328 --> 00:56:02,030
Oh, my God.

666
00:56:02,895 --> 00:56:04,762
It can take over a mind.

667
00:56:07,294 --> 00:56:09,393
John, send everyone home.

668
00:56:09,395 --> 00:56:11,360
Only we in this room
must remain.

669
00:56:11,362 --> 00:56:12,459
Yes, ma'am.

670
00:56:12,461 --> 00:56:15,160
This child must be taken
to a hospital immediately.

671
00:56:15,162 --> 00:56:16,826
No, no.
We must watch over him.

672
00:56:16,828 --> 00:56:17,961
To a hospital immediately.

673
00:56:17,963 --> 00:56:19,693
No. No one else
will understand.

674
00:56:19,695 --> 00:56:21,094
- He must stay here.
- This is insanity.

675
00:56:21,096 --> 00:56:22,227
We will watch over him.

676
00:56:22,229 --> 00:56:24,030
Dr. Price may be right.

677
00:56:24,963 --> 00:56:26,860
No. No. We will protect him.

678
00:56:26,862 --> 00:56:28,359
We will protect him
at all costs.

679
00:56:28,361 --> 00:56:29,661
John, come with me.

680
00:56:29,663 --> 00:56:30,863
Aunt Sarah!

681
00:56:32,995 --> 00:56:35,726
Ma'am, I insist that
you receive medical treatment.

682
00:56:35,728 --> 00:56:38,793
Seal that door.
Thirteen nails.

683
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:39,896
Now.

684
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:41,663
Now!

685
00:56:42,663 --> 00:56:43,830
Yes, ma'am.

686
00:56:48,896 --> 00:56:50,830
You leave my family alone.

687
00:56:53,228 --> 00:56:55,394
You speak with me.

688
00:57:02,362 --> 00:57:04,293
Let's just think this through.

689
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:06,227
Please, Mrs. Marriott,
be rational.

690
00:57:06,229 --> 00:57:08,894
Henry clearly has a trauma
and needs help.

691
00:57:08,896 --> 00:57:10,292
Your aunt is caught
in a superstition.

692
00:57:10,294 --> 00:57:11,827
We need...

693
00:57:59,863 --> 00:58:01,993
Thirteen hooks.

694
00:58:01,995 --> 00:58:03,893
You must listen to me.

695
00:58:03,895 --> 00:58:05,427
Is the rifle room finished?

696
00:58:05,429 --> 00:58:06,794
Yes, ma'am.

697
00:58:06,796 --> 00:58:09,427
My God.
This presence is so strong.

698
00:58:09,429 --> 00:58:10,993
Oh, I feel its hatred...

699
00:58:10,995 --> 00:58:12,128
Oh, enough with the games!

700
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:14,061
We're taking this boy
to a hospital.

701
00:58:14,063 --> 00:58:15,861
- We should listen to him.
- Yes!

702
00:58:15,863 --> 00:58:17,127
The boy tried to kill you.

703
00:58:17,129 --> 00:58:19,660
No. The shadows
will follow us.

704
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:20,961
Wherever we go.

705
00:58:20,963 --> 00:58:23,359
No, Henry will not suffer
the same fate

706
00:58:23,361 --> 00:58:24,894
- as my darling Annie...
- Henry's condition

707
00:58:24,896 --> 00:58:26,127
cannot be cured by witchcraft.

708
00:58:26,129 --> 00:58:27,293
The boy needs a doctor.

709
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:29,894
Conditions can be cured, Doctor.

710
00:58:29,896 --> 00:58:31,293
Curses cannot.

711
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,094
Mrs. Marriott,
will you please listen to me?

712
00:58:33,096 --> 00:58:34,259
- Marion...
- I'm...

713
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:35,827
I'm going with Dr. Price.

714
00:58:35,829 --> 00:58:37,761
- No. Henry must stay.
- I'll make the arrangements.

715
00:58:37,763 --> 00:58:39,192
- Gentlemen, you'll excuse me.
- No! No!

716
00:58:39,194 --> 00:58:41,192
Marion, please!
Henry must stay.

717
00:58:41,194 --> 00:58:42,693
He must stay with us.

718
00:58:42,695 --> 00:58:44,126
Aunt Sarah, I must think
of Henry.

719
00:58:44,128 --> 00:58:45,994
I should go with him.

720
00:58:45,996 --> 00:58:47,329
I will prove it to you.

721
00:58:49,429 --> 00:58:51,162
Yes, I... I will.

722
00:58:51,996 --> 00:58:53,162
This way.

723
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:11,193
<i>Operator.</i>

724
00:59:14,194 --> 00:59:15,861
Winchester Repeating Arms
Company.

725
00:59:15,863 --> 00:59:17,227
This is Arthur Gates.

726
00:59:17,229 --> 00:59:20,693
<i>Mr. Gates,
it's Dr. Eric Price here.</i>

727
00:59:20,695 --> 00:59:23,360
I trust the assessment
is going well, Doctor.

728
00:59:23,362 --> 00:59:25,661
<i>I understand you received
our letter.</i>

729
00:59:25,663 --> 00:59:27,061
It's fine, Mr. Gates.

730
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:30,393
But I require immediate transportation
to the nearest hospital.

731
00:59:30,395 --> 00:59:31,760
Is everything all right?

732
00:59:31,762 --> 00:59:34,693
Everything is fine. Just please,
a driver, as soon as possible.

733
00:59:34,695 --> 00:59:37,028
- Of course, right away.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

734
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:38,894
And the assessment, Doctor?

735
00:59:38,896 --> 00:59:40,229
You'll get what you wanted.

736
00:59:42,396 --> 00:59:43,897
Christ!

737
00:59:47,728 --> 00:59:49,994
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to be rude.

738
00:59:49,996 --> 00:59:53,794
Sir, we're all deeply concerned
for Master Henry's well-being.

739
00:59:53,796 --> 00:59:56,059
If the anything
I can do to assist you, I...

740
00:59:56,061 --> 00:59:57,162
Well...

741
00:59:58,329 --> 00:59:59,860
Actually, you can.

742
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:01,927
I need to get my bags, please.

743
01:00:01,929 --> 01:00:03,960
- Of course.
- Thank you.

744
01:00:03,962 --> 01:00:05,262
Happy to help.

745
01:00:10,261 --> 01:00:13,426
<i>Mrs. Winchester is truly
a remarkable woman.</i>

746
01:00:13,428 --> 01:00:15,292
<i>She knows what she's doing.</i>

747
01:00:15,294 --> 01:00:16,860
She has created a vessel

748
01:00:16,862 --> 01:00:18,427
for the deceased
to communicate with her.

749
01:00:18,429 --> 01:00:20,359
She's certainly created
some architectural oddities.

750
01:00:20,361 --> 01:00:23,663
This house, I've seen things.

751
01:00:26,194 --> 01:00:27,896
I know this room.

752
01:00:29,162 --> 01:00:30,163
Things?

753
01:00:31,396 --> 01:00:32,797
The dead.

754
01:00:34,094 --> 01:00:36,026
Criminals.

755
01:00:36,028 --> 01:00:38,095
Lost souls who met
a violent end.

756
01:00:42,062 --> 01:00:45,129
You've seen them,
haven't you?

757
01:00:52,094 --> 01:00:55,393
Dr. Price, many staff
have reported hearing noises.

758
01:00:55,395 --> 01:00:58,260
They come from inside rooms
that have been nailed shut.

759
01:00:58,262 --> 01:01:00,193
Strange occurrences
in those rooms...

760
01:01:00,195 --> 01:01:01,860
That is why the doors have
been sealed,

761
01:01:01,862 --> 01:01:04,192
to keep the unruly in.

762
01:01:04,194 --> 01:01:06,726
But the staff
have only heard noises.

763
01:01:06,728 --> 01:01:09,193
To see them, well,

764
01:01:09,195 --> 01:01:11,095
I believe you and I
are unique.

765
01:01:11,796 --> 01:01:13,926
Really?

766
01:01:13,928 --> 01:01:15,726
Yes, perhaps it's all
just a symptom

767
01:01:15,728 --> 01:01:18,327
of Mrs. Winchester's
persuasive influence.

768
01:01:18,329 --> 01:01:21,226
Sir, locking Mrs. Marriott
and her child away

769
01:01:21,228 --> 01:01:23,927
is only delaying
the inevitable.

770
01:01:23,929 --> 01:01:25,894
And what is the inevitable?

771
01:01:25,896 --> 01:01:27,292
They're all Winchester.

772
01:01:27,294 --> 01:01:28,995
They will all die.

773
01:01:56,662 --> 01:01:58,960
Mr. Hansen. Is she in there?

774
01:01:58,962 --> 01:02:01,159
- Yes, Doctor.
- Good. You need to hear this.

775
01:02:01,161 --> 01:02:03,260
Mrs. Winchester,
there is a man in your employ

776
01:02:03,262 --> 01:02:05,229
who has clearly lost his mind.
He just...

777
01:02:07,095 --> 01:02:08,360
That's him.

778
01:02:08,362 --> 01:02:10,893
You saw him?
You spoke with him?

779
01:02:10,895 --> 01:02:12,394
Well, yes,
I spoke with him just now.

780
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:13,826
The man threatened you.

781
01:02:13,828 --> 01:02:15,763
Read it. Read the paper.

782
01:02:18,962 --> 01:02:21,893
"Corporal Benjamin Joseph Block
was killed during a siege

783
01:02:21,895 --> 01:02:23,794
"at the Winchester Repeating
Arms general office."

784
01:02:23,796 --> 01:02:24,959
That's impossible.

785
01:02:24,961 --> 01:02:27,362
This newspaper
is 20 years old.

786
01:02:29,863 --> 01:02:31,259
Cruelty, grief, and loss

787
01:02:31,261 --> 01:02:34,028
can make people do
unimaginable things.

788
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:40,761
Ben lost two brothers
on the battlefield.

789
01:02:40,763 --> 01:02:43,760
The youngest was
only 14 years old.

790
01:02:43,762 --> 01:02:46,126
Their Confederate muskets
were no match

791
01:02:46,128 --> 01:02:48,928
for the Winchester rifles
of the Union Army.

792
01:02:49,828 --> 01:02:51,029
They were cut down.

793
01:02:57,861 --> 01:03:00,661
<i>Ben swore revenge.</i>

794
01:03:00,663 --> 01:03:02,761

who created the weapon</i>

795
01:03:02,763 --> 01:03:05,394
<i>that killed his brothers

796
01:03:05,396 --> 01:03:07,229
<i>as those who pulled
the trigger.</i>

797
01:03:16,994 --> 01:03:20,129
He killed 15 innocent people
that day.

798
01:03:21,396 --> 01:03:23,160
He locked himself
in the display room.

<i>We used to call it
the show-off room.</i>

817
01:05:03,662 --> 01:05:06,761
This is an exact replica
of the room he was killed in.

818
01:05:07,328 --> 01:05:08,893
Yes.

819
01:05:08,895 --> 01:05:12,296
And now that it is complete,
he is in this world.

820
01:05:13,161 --> 01:05:15,596
Do you see anyone, Doctor?

821
01:05:16,727 --> 01:05:18,027
It's impossible.

822
01:05:18,029 --> 01:05:20,128
Doctor, you must believe.

823
01:05:20,995 --> 01:05:22,096
It's illogical.

824
01:05:32,827 --> 01:05:34,095
Corporal Block,

825
01:05:35,028 --> 01:05:36,330
please,

826
01:05:38,395 --> 01:05:41,393
please feel my deep remorse

827
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:42,761
for the death of your brothers,

828
01:05:44,195 --> 01:05:47,725
of James and young Harry

829
01:05:47,727 --> 01:05:50,026
by the Winchester rifle.

830
01:05:50,028 --> 01:05:53,329
I know all three of you feel
pain and torment.

831
01:05:54,727 --> 01:05:57,296
But violence cannot bring
justice.

832
01:05:58,061 --> 01:05:59,760
Only more suffering,

833
01:05:59,762 --> 01:06:03,630
and I will not allow my family
to suffer anymore.

834
01:06:05,894 --> 01:06:08,327
Leave this house
with your brothers.

835
01:06:08,329 --> 01:06:11,163
I hope together
you can find peace.

fell into his well.

Go on, Eric.

What?

874
01:12:30,862 --> 01:12:32,229
He heard the mule crying.

875
01:12:33,695 --> 01:12:35,825
And it broke his heart.

876
01:12:35,827 --> 01:12:38,291
He chose to bury
the animal in the well

877
01:12:38,293 --> 01:12:40,262
- and put it out of its...
- Its hardship.

878
01:12:41,828 --> 01:12:44,759
He started shoveling.

879
01:12:44,761 --> 01:12:48,993
The mule realized that every
time dirt fell on his back,

880
01:12:48,995 --> 01:12:52,227
he could shake it off
and step up.

881
01:12:52,229 --> 01:12:53,993
Shovel after shovel.

882
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:55,127
He could shake it off

883
01:12:55,129 --> 01:12:57,126
- and he could step up...
- Shake it off.

884
01:12:57,128 --> 01:13:00,126
It wasn't long
before the old mule,

885
01:13:00,128 --> 01:13:02,860
battered and exhausted,

886
01:13:02,862 --> 01:13:06,126
stepped over the wall

- Saved him.
- And he overcame...

889

The voices are

893
01:13:19,293 --> 01:13:20,693
They were never real.

894

They were just inside

for you to believe me. But...

896
01:13:25,028 --> 01:13:27,259

I should have put you in care.

Yes. Put the gun down,
Ruby, please.

905

01:21:34,993 --> 01:21:36,761
- Do you see him?
- No.

984
01:21:38,926 --> 01:21:40,426
There. Done.

985
01:21:40,428 --> 01:21:42,026
Now he's locked in.

986
01:21:42,028 --> 01:21:43,162
And so are we.

987
01:21:53,361 --> 01:21:56,162
Ben, show yourself.

988
01:21:58,361 --> 01:21:59,828
Show yourself!

989
01:22:34,327 --> 01:22:38,062
Your anger will
never defeat us.

990
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:01,061
You took everything from me!

991
01:23:09,127 --> 01:23:10,925
They're going right
through him.

992
01:23:10,927 --> 01:23:12,861
- You saw him?
- Yes.

993
01:23:26,993 --> 01:23:28,094
Who's there?

994
01:23:29,793 --> 01:23:31,159
You're there.

995
01:23:31,161 --> 01:23:33,660
You are there amongst
the dead.

996
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,292
It's not the gun.

997
01:23:36,294 --> 01:23:38,927
He's afraid of something else.

998
01:23:47,395 --> 01:23:50,225
You kept it
and refurbished it.

999
01:23:50,227 --> 01:23:51,961
All because it's a reminder
of my past.

1000
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:54,226
<i>Instruments of death</i>

1001
01:23:54,228 --> 01:23:56,895
<i>have a powerful connection
to the afterlife.</i>

1002
01:23:58,394 --> 01:24:01,961
What should have killed him,
saved him.

1003
01:24:11,994 --> 01:24:15,861
Ben, we can help you be free
of your torment.

1004
01:24:22,227 --> 01:24:23,627
I'm a mother...

1005
01:24:29,394 --> 01:24:30,427
A fighter.

1006
01:24:34,294 --> 01:24:35,362
Show yourself.

1007
01:24:38,394 --> 01:24:39,761
A protector.

1008
01:24:41,793 --> 01:24:44,660
And I am not afraid.

1009
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,061
<i>See the truth.</i>

1010
01:26:05,993 --> 01:26:07,127
Yes.

1011
01:26:15,693 --> 01:26:17,061
He's at peace.

1012
01:26:18,061 --> 01:26:19,962
He has joined his brothers.

1013
01:26:20,926 --> 01:26:23,661
You've done it. They're gone.

1014
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:32,261
Everybody else,
go back to your rooms.

1015
01:26:34,826 --> 01:26:36,061
All of you.

1016
01:27:01,861 --> 01:27:03,228
Henry.

1017
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:06,159
Henry!

1018
01:27:06,161 --> 01:27:08,661
Henry! Oh, Henry!

1019
01:27:14,028 --> 01:27:16,059
<i>Dear Mr. Gates,</i>

1020
01:27:16,061 --> 01:27:18,358
<i>below you will find
my psychological assessment</i>

1021
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:20,292
<i>and mental status examination</i>

1022
01:27:20,294 --> 01:27:23,325
<i>of Mrs. Sarah Lockwood
Winchester.</i>

1023
01:27:23,327 --> 01:27:26,392
<i>It was conducted at her home
between the dates of April 12</i>

1024
01:27:26,394 --> 01:27:29,325
<i>to April 19, 1906,</i>

1025
01:27:29,327 --> 01:27:30,858
<i>and prepared at the request</i>

1026
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:33,226
<i>of the Winchester Repeating
Arms Company.</i>

1027
01:27:33,228 --> 01:27:35,192
<i>In my professional opinion,</i>

1028
01:27:35,194 --> 01:27:37,159
<i>after having observed
Mrs. Winchester</i>

1029
01:27:37,161 --> 01:27:38,325
<i>for the past week,</i>

1030
01:27:38,327 --> 01:27:42,126
<i>it is my conclusion that
she is of sound mind and body,</i>

1031
01:27:42,128 --> 01:27:44,125
<i>and is fit to continue
in her role</i>

1032
01:27:44,127 --> 01:27:46,891
<i>with the Winchester
Repeating Arms Company</i>

1033
01:27:46,893 --> 01:27:49,361
<i>for as long as
she desires such a burden.</i>

1034
01:27:54,393 --> 01:27:57,294
<i>Yours truly,
Dr. Eric A. Price.</i>

1035
01:28:14,961 --> 01:28:17,695
It's time for us both
to leave this house.

1036
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:22,128
I'll always miss you.

1037
01:28:38,161 --> 01:28:41,724
Thank you, Dr. Price,
for your help.

1038
01:28:41,726 --> 01:28:43,061
Young man.

1039
01:28:46,394 --> 01:28:47,728
Thank you.

1040
01:29:01,826 --> 01:29:03,027
Time for me to say goodbye.

1041
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:14,127
Ruby loves you.

1042
01:29:15,693 --> 01:29:17,895
That did not stop
after her death.

1043
01:29:18,726 --> 01:29:20,628
You know that, don't you?

1044
01:29:22,028 --> 01:29:23,127
I do.

1045
01:29:28,994 --> 01:29:30,927
You know,
in spite of everything,

1046
01:29:32,794 --> 01:29:35,290
you really do have
a beautiful home.

1047
01:29:35,292 --> 01:29:36,894
What are you going to do next?

1048
01:29:38,228 --> 01:29:39,995
Rebuild, of course.

1049
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:43,261
Of course.

1050
