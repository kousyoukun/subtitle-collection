1
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,266
Henry?

2
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,024
Henry.

3
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,987
Henry.

4
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,873
Henry?

5
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,923
Darling, what is it?

6
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,927
What are you doing?

7
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,086
He's coming for us.

8
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,290
Nancy: I couldn't move.

9
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,627
I started shaking.
I was getting dizzy.

10
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,508
I was sure everyone
in the room wanted to kill me.

11
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,352
I've never been so scared.

12
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,911
Pointless in the end though,
fear, isn't it?

13
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,457
That's your best advice, doc?

14
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,460
All right.

15
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,052
What do you think
controls you?

16
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,514
Your body or your mind?

17
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,308
Your money controls me, sugar.

18
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,479
Ah, there you go.

19
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:55,939
- Fine.
- Okay, okay.

20
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,483
I think my body and mind
control each other.

21
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,319
Well, let's find out.

22
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,154
Is this real?

23
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,406
Yes.

24
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,824
- Yes?
- Yes.

25
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,119
The mind

26
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,329
is incredibly creative.

27
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,457
It can make us see situations

28
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,378
that appear completely real,

29
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,007
but are in fact

30
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,384
nothing more than illusions,

31
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:29,014
perceptions of truth.

32
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,099
How did you do that?

33
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,980
Sometimes we all need
a little help

34
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,317
to see the difference
between reality and illusion.

35
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,988
And that's
about taking control,

36
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:50,160
about not letting fear
control you.

37
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:54,581
Because fear in the end
only exists in your mind.

38
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,961
Eric: All right.
Sorry to say good night.

39
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,051
L'm looking for Dr. Price.

40
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,222
Good night.
I'm Arthur Gates,

41
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:14,225
Chief Legal Officer of the Winchester
Repeating Arms Company.

42
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,518
Really?

43
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,187
Nancy: See you
next week, sugar.

44
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,855
You're a hard man to reach,
Dr. Price.

45
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,317
Good night, Nancy.

46
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,568
- Good night.
- Good night.

47
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,571
L'm on sabbatical.

48
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,032
Good night.

49
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,494
What do you want?
A prescription?

50
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,496
I've come to offer
you employment.

51
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,959
- Whiskey?
- No, thank you.

52
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,087
Are you familiar with
Sarah Winchester, Dr. Price?

53
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,631
Mrs. Winchester's
husband William

54
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,007
was the majority shareholder

55
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,468
of the Winchester
Repeating Arms Company.

56
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,513
Twenty-five years ago,
William passed,

57
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,265
leaving Mrs. Winchester
a rather large inheritance,

58
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,769
and 51% of the company.

59
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:01,439
Mrs. Winchester also lost
her only child, Annie.

60
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,110
It's said in her grief,

61
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:09,698
she turned to a medium...
Spiritualist of some sort.

62
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:13,451
The medium may have taken
advantage of her mental state.

63
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,286
That's not uncommon
after a tragedy.

64
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,122
I can assure you,

65
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,500
Sarah Winchester
is anything but common.

66
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,503
Aye, after her spiritual
encounter,

67
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,047
she moved across the country
to San Jose,

68
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,799
- where she purchased what...
- Where's <i>my...</i>

69
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,260
Was then
an eight-room house.

70
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,594
Maybe it's in
the garden room.

71
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,055
She spent the last 20 years
expanding it.

72
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,726
What stands now is

73
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,395
a gargantuan seven
storied structure,

74
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,272
with no apparent
rhyme or reason,

75
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,732
no master plan,

76
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:48,778
each maze of halls
more confusing than the next.

77
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,114
A house under
never-ending construction,

78
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,742
built on the orders
of a grieving widow

79
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:57,787
whose mind is as chaotic
as the house itself.

80
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,957
Over the years, she's become
more and more reclusive.

81
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,376
Last month,
the Board of Directors

82
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,753
enacted its right to assess

83
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,005
Mrs. Winchester's
state of mind,

84
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,883
to determine if she's fit
to control the company.

85
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,470
You want to take it
away from her?

86
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,514
We're worried about
her sanity, Dr. Price.

87
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,019
We need a professional.

88
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,980
Any kind of diagnosis

89
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,524
from such a long distance
would be impossible.

90
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,568
Well, Mrs. Winchester's agreed

91
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,653
to let you stay
at the residence.

92
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,114
An offer
that is exceedingly rare.

93
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,577
An unwilling patient,
the long distance.

94
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,746
This is not
something ordinarily I...

95
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,956
- Name the amount.
- Doesn't really work like that.

96
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,166
How much do you owe?

97
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,086
Mortgage?

98
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,670
Hospital expenses?

99
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,632
Medicine?

100
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,842
Three hundred.

101
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,344
We'll pay six.

102
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,763
For the appropriate assessment.

103
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,052
Uaughs)

104
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,274
Foreman: Mrs. Winchester
requests the bay window frame

105
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,025
be installed by sundown.

106
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,235
Move with haste.

107
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:03,705
Frank: Let me get that, sir.

108
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:05,832
Thank you.

109
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,047
Frank: Busy day
of construction here, sir.

110
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,257
- Yes.
- Days and nights

111
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,425
are always busy here.

112
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,719
Eric: Really? Nights, too?

113
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,470
Frank: Right round
the clock, sir.

114
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:20,638
This way.

115
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,977
Most of the rooms
don't stay up very long,

116
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,313
like Mrs. Winchester's
garden room there.

117
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,732
That might not
last the season.

118
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,983
Eric: Really?

119
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,777
Worker: Check the measurements
here have been done.

120
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,071
Frank: Please wait
in the library, sir.

121
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,657
<i>L'll</i> call for Mrs. Marriott.

122
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,007
- Jesus!
- My apologies, sir.

123
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,260
The door was making
a terrible racket.

124
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:41,386
Eric: No, no, no, no, no.

125
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,263
That's quite all right.

126
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,681
Gave me a fright.

127
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,232
Marion: Dr. Price?

128
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,608
- Yes.
- Welcome.

129
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,944
Marion Marriott,
Mrs. Winchester's niece.

130
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,822
Oh. Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

131
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:05,243
I must say, I have never
quite seen a house like this.

132
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,496
My aunt advised me
of the nature of your visit.

133
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,206
As you are aware,
it is unfortunate timing,

134
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,499
so I would ask you
to behave in a manner

135
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,001
befitting the circumstance.

136
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,585
Unfortunate, how?

137
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,129
A tragedy occurred.

138
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,755
Oh.

139
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,132
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

140
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,758
Are you carrying firearms?

141
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,052
Should I be?

142
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,262
Aunt Sarah forbids them.

143
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,597
Well.

144
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,766
I'm completely unarmed.

145
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,644
Good. You, like I,
like everyone,

146
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:32,979
are guests
in Aunt Sarah's home.

147
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,230
You will abide
by her rules.

148
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,232
Understood.

149
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,067
You are to stay in this section
of the house, the east wing.

150
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,069
Aunt Sarah's private domains
are off limits.

151
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,279
Understood.

152
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,740
Eric: So...

153
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,867
Are you close to your aunt?

154
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,660
Is this already part of your evaluation,
Dr. Price?

155
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,579
No, ma'am,
it is not.

156
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,414
Yes.

157
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,041
Aunt Sarah
is an exceptional woman.

158
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,292
She does not deserve
to be treated

159
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,210
with anything less
than complete respect.

160
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,796
Yes, ma'am. Quite right.

161
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,512
May I?

162
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,226
Marion:
This is the grand ballroom,

163
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,187
built almost entirely
without nails.

164
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,774
The walls and parquet floor
are made of six separate hard woods.

165
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,443
The silver chandelier
was imported from Germany.

166
00:14:26,528 --> 00:14:28,530
Follow me, Doctor.

167
00:14:28,613 --> 00:14:30,448
There are almost one hundred
rooms in the house.

168
00:14:30,532 --> 00:14:31,825
It's easy to get lost.

169
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:06,914
How unusual.

170
00:15:06,998 --> 00:15:08,874
Aunt Sarah
suffers from arthritis.

171
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,585
This makes climbing stairs
manageable for her.

172
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:13,879
The house can be overwhelming.
Do keep up.

173
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,113
Eric: What is this?

174
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:24,866
It's a communication device.

175
00:15:25,534 --> 00:15:27,369
Really?

176
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:29,162
You speak into the holes,
and a series of pipes

177
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:30,914
travel the sound
to the desired room.

178
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:39,673
- Ingenious.
- Yes.

179
00:15:39,756 --> 00:15:42,509
You'll find many of my aunt's
inventions are state of the art.

180
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:45,011
I trust you'll find everything
you need with the room.

181
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:47,973
Aunt Sarah will be
joining us for dinner.

182
00:15:48,056 --> 00:15:50,642
Perhaps you would like
to freshen up beforehand.

183
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:52,644
I very much look forward
to meeting your aunt.

184
00:15:53,728 --> 00:15:54,813
Aunt Sarah
would not approve of you

185
00:15:54,896 --> 00:15:55,981
drinking before dinner hour.

186
00:15:57,232 --> 00:15:59,818
Her sense of smell
is still as acute as mine.

187
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:02,654
Respect her wishes.

188
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:16,126
You were right about me, Ruby.

189
00:16:20,297 --> 00:16:21,882
lam

190
00:16:24,468 --> 00:16:25,969
a fraud.

191
00:16:42,444 --> 00:16:44,988
You're a phony, hmm?

192
00:16:48,492 --> 00:16:49,993
That feels good.

193
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:58,418
Well, you don't know
what you're doing.

194
00:17:03,048 --> 00:17:04,925
You don't know
what you're doing.

195
00:17:05,008 --> 00:17:08,011
Oh, yeah. You prove nothing.

196
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,646
For Christ's sake.

197
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:22,108
Jesus Christ!

198
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:57,352
Ah!

199
00:18:07,863 --> 00:18:09,322
Who are you?
What do you want?

200
00:18:09,406 --> 00:18:12,450
Dinner will be served
in 10 minutes.

201
00:18:12,534 --> 00:18:14,870
- You're alone, yes?
- Yes, sir.

202
00:18:14,953 --> 00:18:17,330
- Nobody else with you?
- No, sir.

203
00:18:17,414 --> 00:18:19,583
No? You didn't see anyone
just come out of here?

204
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,792
Are you all right, sir?

205
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:25,547
L'm fine. I just thought
someone else was...

206
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,257
Well, I thought I saw
someone else in my room.

207
00:18:29,384 --> 00:18:30,552
Interesting.

208
00:18:30,635 --> 00:18:32,137
Look, I'm fine, yes.

209
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,722
Dinner in 10 minutes, yes?

210
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:35,724
- Sir.
- Good, thank you.

211
00:18:42,981 --> 00:18:44,649
Take it nice and easy.

212
00:18:47,277 --> 00:18:48,320
There.

213
00:19:05,503 --> 00:19:06,630
Henry.

214
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:08,715
Stop it.

215
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:19,309
Marion: Henry, stop that!

216
00:19:21,853 --> 00:19:24,773
Henry. Henry! Just...

217
00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:29,319
Henry, you must be
very excited

218
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:31,863
to spend some time
in your great aunt's house.

219
00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:35,533
We're here
because Father died.

220
00:19:38,995 --> 00:19:41,164
Well, I am very sorry
for your loss, young man.

221
00:19:41,957 --> 00:19:44,209
- L'm not.
- Henry!

222
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:46,378
It's my fault.
I didn't mean to pry.

223
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:49,714
Of course, you did.
That's why you're here.

224
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:54,469
Yes. Suppose so.

225
00:19:54,552 --> 00:19:56,680
I recently lost
someone myself.

226
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:58,682
So if you feel like
discussing anything,

227
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:00,892
I might be able
to provide some assistance

228
00:20:00,976 --> 00:20:03,186
to yourself
or young Henry here.

229
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,440
I imagine you must be
very good at your job

230
00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:10,068
if Aunt Sarah chose you
to be her assessor.

231
00:20:13,321 --> 00:20:15,573
I had no idea
she chose me herself.

232
00:20:15,657 --> 00:20:17,659
L'm just hoping I can help.

233
00:20:17,742 --> 00:20:19,452
If you want to help, Doctor,

234
00:20:19,536 --> 00:20:20,829
you can give my aunt
a clean bill of health

235
00:20:20,912 --> 00:20:22,956
and be on your way.

236
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,708
Well, I have a duty
to my profession

237
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,710
and an obligation
to my employers.

238
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,213
Aunt Sarah is your employer.

239
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:33,216
It is still half her company.

240
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,942
- Madam.
- Good evening, Madam.

241
00:20:54,571 --> 00:20:56,197
Good evening, Madam.

242
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:32,317
Dr. Price.

243
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,195
Mrs. Winchester, it's a
pleasure to finally meet you.

244
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:36,529
The pleasure is due
to the lawyers

245
00:21:36,613 --> 00:21:39,282
of the Winchester
Repeating Arms Company.

246
00:21:40,742 --> 00:21:42,327
Yes.

247
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,121
I suppose you're right.

248
00:21:45,205 --> 00:21:47,791
I hope everything has been
to your satisfaction so far?

249
00:21:47,874 --> 00:21:50,126
I cannot fault
the hospitality.

250
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:53,254
It's quite a special house,
is it not?

251
00:21:54,631 --> 00:21:56,382
Now that, ma'am,
is a fact beyond dispute.

252
00:21:59,302 --> 00:22:00,345
Thank you.

253
00:22:03,348 --> 00:22:05,642
I understand the Winchester
is still considered

254
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:07,519
the superior rifle
on the market, ma'am.

255
00:22:07,977 --> 00:22:09,312
Superior?

256
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,315
Superior at what?

257
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:16,569
Accuracy, range,
stopping power.

258
00:22:16,653 --> 00:22:18,029
Killing.

259
00:22:18,113 --> 00:22:19,948
Indiscriminate killing.

260
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:22,867
Very superior.

261
00:22:22,951 --> 00:22:27,122
You feel responsible for
the misuse of your product?

262
00:22:27,205 --> 00:22:28,998
If a weapon works
as intended,

263
00:22:29,082 --> 00:22:30,917
one can hardly
call it a misuse.

264
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,336
Marion: Well, it can
be used for good or bad,

265
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,380
depending on the person
wielding it.

266
00:22:38,675 --> 00:22:40,677
Yes.

267
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,180
Then again, perhaps roller skates
are a less dangerous endeavor.

268
00:22:44,264 --> 00:22:45,849
Marion:
The company is expanding,

269
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:47,934
looking for other
opportunities.

270
00:22:48,017 --> 00:22:50,145
I understand that was at
your behest, Mrs. Winchester?

271
00:22:50,228 --> 00:22:51,437
Marion: It was.

272
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:53,648
To the displeasure
of the board.

273
00:22:53,731 --> 00:22:56,025
It appears that strapping
wheels to one's feet

274
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:59,362
can also be a
perilous endeavor.

275
00:23:01,906 --> 00:23:02,907
Hear, hear.

276
00:23:23,094 --> 00:23:25,638
Ruby: <i>Tell me the story
about the farmer</i>

277
00:23:25,722 --> 00:23:27,974
- who owned the old mule.
- Eric: No.

278
00:23:28,057 --> 00:23:30,351
<i>Ruby".
I always liked that story.</i>

279
00:23:31,186 --> 00:23:34,022
<i>A delusional disorder.</i>

280
00:23:34,105 --> 00:23:35,231
- Eric: <i>Yes.</i>
- Ruby: <i>That's what you called it.</i>

281
00:23:35,315 --> 00:23:36,649
Eric: Yes.

282
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:38,026
<i>Ruby".
I don't want to talk anymore.</i>

283
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:40,361
<i>I</i> need you to believe me.

284
00:23:40,445 --> 00:23:44,282
<i>Eric". I want to be with you, Ruby.
Together forever.</i>

285
00:23:44,365 --> 00:23:45,408
(gunshon

286
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:15,230
Hello?

287
00:24:28,923 --> 00:24:30,091
Hello?

288
00:27:05,394 --> 00:27:06,603
Christ!

289
00:27:10,357 --> 00:27:12,693
uaughs)

290
00:27:12,776 --> 00:27:14,403
You've poisoned
your mind, Eric.

291
00:27:14,486 --> 00:27:16,530
You've poisoned your mind.

292
00:27:16,613 --> 00:27:18,281
I need some air.

293
00:28:40,655 --> 00:28:41,740
Deja vu.

294
00:30:13,874 --> 00:30:14,958
Hey!

295
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,336
Hey!

296
00:30:19,337 --> 00:30:20,881
Move, hey! Move! Move!

297
00:30:29,347 --> 00:30:30,849
I see you.

298
00:30:36,313 --> 00:30:38,857
Oh, Henry! Darling!

299
00:30:42,193 --> 00:30:43,653
What's happening
to you, sweetheart?

300
00:30:48,825 --> 00:30:50,118
Thank you.

301
00:30:55,081 --> 00:30:57,083
Mario: Darling,
what's happening to you?

302
00:31:02,714 --> 00:31:04,507
Eric: Mrs. Winchester,

303
00:31:04,591 --> 00:31:06,384
I really must have
your full attention.

304
00:31:06,468 --> 00:31:08,178
Oh, you have it, Dr. Price.

305
00:31:08,261 --> 00:31:10,931
Yes, but perhaps you would
be more comfortable if...

306
00:31:11,014 --> 00:31:13,808
Last night was quite
a traumatic event.

307
00:31:13,892 --> 00:31:16,061
L'm grateful for your actions.

308
00:31:16,144 --> 00:31:18,104
I fear you may
have me at a...

309
00:31:18,188 --> 00:31:20,440
An emotional
disadvantage today.

310
00:31:20,523 --> 00:31:22,233
Yes, I understand.

311
00:31:22,317 --> 00:31:24,569
I don't mean to pry,
but has Master Henry

312
00:31:24,653 --> 00:31:26,404
been prone to sleepwalking
in the past?

313
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,449
No.

314
00:31:29,532 --> 00:31:30,909
But you may know,
he did witness

315
00:31:30,992 --> 00:31:32,327
the death of his father.

316
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:33,870
Yes.

317
00:31:36,706 --> 00:31:37,832
Well, this is the first

318
00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:39,793
in a series of sessions
I wish to conduct.

319
00:31:39,876 --> 00:31:42,379
And I can assure you that
today will be quite benign.

320
00:31:42,462 --> 00:31:44,923
No, no, no. Let's just
get straight to it, Doctor.

321
00:31:45,006 --> 00:31:47,342
You are here to assess
my erratic behavior,

322
00:31:47,425 --> 00:31:48,426
are you not?

323
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,136
Well, erratic behavior
is not the phrase

324
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,471
that I would've
chosen,but"

325
00:31:51,554 --> 00:31:54,015
Now, I'll speak
with you truthfully. Please.

326
00:31:54,099 --> 00:31:56,017
But you will do me
the same courtesy.

327
00:31:56,101 --> 00:31:57,435
Of course.

328
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,229
Do you suffer
from soldier's syndrome?

329
00:32:00,021 --> 00:32:01,022
<i>I'm sorry'?</i>

330
00:32:01,106 --> 00:32:04,776
Are you an abuser
of medication?

331
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:06,903
Mrs. Winchester, I think it's
best if I ask the questions.

332
00:32:06,987 --> 00:32:10,115
Your wife, did she believe
you are a good therapist?

333
00:32:10,198 --> 00:32:11,449
We're not here
to discuss my wife.

334
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:13,034
Your wife Ruby?

335
00:32:16,246 --> 00:32:17,372
No, we are not.

336
00:32:17,455 --> 00:32:19,499
And I would appreciate
your honesty.

337
00:32:19,582 --> 00:32:20,959
Are you an abuser
of medication?

338
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:22,210
No, I'm not.

339
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:30,969
- So...
- I will share a fact with you,

340
00:32:31,052 --> 00:32:32,470
which you may
find questionable.

341
00:32:32,554 --> 00:32:34,848
But I assure you,
it is a fact.

342
00:32:34,931 --> 00:32:36,433
Please.

343
00:32:36,516 --> 00:32:38,143
I am cursed.

344
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,811
Cursed, how?

345
00:32:39,894 --> 00:32:41,813
Have you read my papers?

346
00:32:41,896 --> 00:32:43,189
- Of course, I have.
- And what did they say?

347
00:32:43,273 --> 00:32:44,649
Well, among many things,

348
00:32:44,733 --> 00:32:47,110
they say that this is
the house that spirits built.

349
00:32:47,193 --> 00:32:50,238
See, profiting from such
a thing as violence and death,

350
00:32:53,366 --> 00:32:56,661
that is a wickedness that
follows you like a shadow.

351
00:32:56,745 --> 00:33:00,248
Yes, we might also call
those shadows "guilt."

352
00:33:00,331 --> 00:33:02,375
But tell me, how do
these shadows follow you?

353
00:33:02,459 --> 00:33:04,335
I may be getting old,
Dr. Price,

354
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:06,337
but I assure you,
I have not lost my senses.

355
00:33:06,421 --> 00:33:10,050
I know the difference
between illusion and reality.

356
00:33:11,134 --> 00:33:12,177
I see.

357
00:33:15,305 --> 00:33:17,557
Your mind rules your body.

358
00:33:18,767 --> 00:33:20,769
The mind
can be incredibly creative.

359
00:33:20,852 --> 00:33:24,773
But it can also, at times, fail us.

360
00:33:24,856 --> 00:33:26,900
My mind has never failed me.

361
00:33:26,983 --> 00:33:30,862
What we see, taste, and touch

362
00:33:30,945 --> 00:33:33,907
are interpreted and processed
to give us our truth.

363
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:36,910
And that truth can in turn
be an illusion,

364
00:33:36,993 --> 00:33:41,748
created, distorted, by grief.

365
00:33:45,168 --> 00:33:47,045
Do you believe in ghosts,
Dr. Price?

366
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:50,590
No, ma'am. Why would I?

367
00:33:50,673 --> 00:33:53,802
Offering my staff that bill
would be greatly appreciated.

368
00:33:53,885 --> 00:33:55,470
Even the nickel
inside the bill

369
00:33:55,553 --> 00:33:57,555
would be a respectable start.

370
00:33:59,307 --> 00:34:01,976
Oh, really! Silly illusions?

371
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,436
Do you take me for a fool?

372
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,813
No, ma'am. I do not.

373
00:34:04,896 --> 00:34:06,314
No more diversions
from reality.

374
00:34:06,397 --> 00:34:08,149
No more parlor tricks.

375
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:10,151
And your medication
will have to be confiscated.

376
00:34:10,235 --> 00:34:12,779
Mrs. Winchester, I'm sorry,
but I must insist, I'm not a child...

377
00:34:12,862 --> 00:34:14,948
- This is my home, Dr. Price.
- And I will not be...

378
00:34:15,031 --> 00:34:16,574
You will obey my rules.

379
00:34:18,034 --> 00:34:20,161
If you want me to open up
this house for you,

380
00:34:20,245 --> 00:34:21,621
you need clarity.

381
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:27,127
Do you have another
question for me?

382
00:34:29,671 --> 00:34:30,672
Yes, ma'am.

383
00:34:34,926 --> 00:34:38,304
Is it really necessary
to confine me to quarters?

384
00:34:38,388 --> 00:34:39,848
That is Madam's wish, sir.

385
00:34:41,266 --> 00:34:43,143
Hmm.

386
00:34:43,226 --> 00:34:44,811
And the condition
of Master Henry?

387
00:34:44,894 --> 00:34:47,522
He too is confined
to quarters.

388
00:34:47,605 --> 00:34:49,983
And Mrs. Marriott
has not left his side.

389
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,680
Damn it!

390
00:35:34,068 --> 00:35:37,030
"Sir, the members of the board
eagerly await your evaluation.

391
00:35:37,113 --> 00:35:39,282
"L trust you will make
an accurate assessment.

392
00:35:39,365 --> 00:35:41,534
"Regards, Arthur C. Gates,
Chief Legal Officer."

393
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,090
Eric: Sarah <i>Winchester's
psychological assessment</i>

394
00:35:56,174 --> 00:35:58,343
<i>and mental status
examination.</i>

395
00:35:58,426 --> 00:36:01,679
<i>Dr. Eric A. Price,
April 16, 1906.</i>

396
00:36:03,264 --> 00:36:05,308
<i>Appearance, normal.</i>

397
00:36:05,391 --> 00:36:08,144
<i>Hygiene,
physical characteristics, all normal.</i>

398
00:36:08,228 --> 00:36:11,564
<i>Patient struggles with the
loss of her husband and child.</i>

399
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:14,150
<i>Her behavior is at times
slightly aggressive.</i>

400
00:36:14,234 --> 00:36:16,653
<i>Perception,
visual hallucinations</i>

401
00:36:16,736 --> 00:36:20,114
<i>that patient often refers to
as shadows or ghosts.</i>

402
00:36:22,283 --> 00:36:25,119
I feel them, their presence.

403
00:36:32,961 --> 00:36:34,045
Go on.

404
00:36:38,883 --> 00:36:42,345
I feel their presence,
their energy.

405
00:36:42,428 --> 00:36:46,516
<i>Their unfinished business
has brought them here.</i>

406
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:48,518
Do you perhaps
in any way blame them

407
00:36:48,601 --> 00:36:51,354
for the death
of your husband and child?

408
00:36:51,437 --> 00:36:55,650
I will mourn William
and dear Annie always.

409
00:36:55,733 --> 00:36:58,403
I love all my family
very much, Dr. Price.

410
00:36:58,486 --> 00:37:01,322
They are the true
riches of my life,

411
00:37:01,406 --> 00:37:04,325
and I will do whatever
it takes to protect them.

412
00:37:18,631 --> 00:37:20,133
Can you tell me why the...

413
00:37:20,216 --> 00:37:22,051
Why those bells
chime at midnight?

414
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:23,970
It's midnight, sir.

415
00:37:24,762 --> 00:37:27,432
Well, yes.

416
00:37:27,515 --> 00:37:28,766
But is there
any significance to it?

417
00:37:30,268 --> 00:37:31,436
It's midnight, sir.

418
00:37:35,064 --> 00:37:36,149
Thank you.

419
00:40:59,227 --> 00:41:01,103
I swear, the laudanum
is still in my system.

420
00:41:02,438 --> 00:41:06,817
Let's just hope
it's withdrawals.

421
00:41:06,901 --> 00:41:10,404
It always was withdrawals.
It had to be. Had to be.

422
00:41:15,076 --> 00:41:17,078
Sarah: <i>I have</i> a <i>question
for you, Dr. Price.</i>

423
00:41:17,161 --> 00:41:18,788
Again, Mrs. Winchester,
it's best if I ask...

424
00:41:18,871 --> 00:41:20,248
What is it like to die?

425
00:41:20,331 --> 00:41:21,624
Talking about your...

426
00:41:21,707 --> 00:41:24,168
Deceased for three minutes,
were you not?

427
00:41:28,506 --> 00:41:32,301
You know, I keep records

428
00:41:32,385 --> 00:41:35,388
of all the lives
a Winchester has taken.

429
00:41:35,471 --> 00:41:39,141
Hundreds have been reported.
Probably thousands haven't.

430
00:41:40,476 --> 00:41:42,853
The guilty, the innocent...

431
00:41:42,937 --> 00:41:45,106
The rifle doesn't discriminate.

432
00:41:45,189 --> 00:41:48,401
And many of the souls
make their way to this house.

433
00:41:48,484 --> 00:41:50,611
That's impressive.

434
00:41:50,695 --> 00:41:52,280
As you can clearly see,
I am still here.

435
00:41:52,363 --> 00:41:54,782
So perhaps you could do me

436
00:41:54,865 --> 00:41:56,659
the kindness of taking me
off that shelf.

437
00:41:57,827 --> 00:41:58,953
You were shot.

438
00:41:59,036 --> 00:42:00,329
I was.

439
00:42:07,296 --> 00:42:08,589
This.

440
00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:11,634
And it did kill me.

441
00:42:16,889 --> 00:42:19,600
You kept it and refurbished it.

442
00:42:20,434 --> 00:42:23,020
- I did.
- Why?

443
00:42:23,104 --> 00:42:25,189
Well, because
it's a reminder of my past.

444
00:42:26,149 --> 00:42:28,442
Because it's my
connection to death

445
00:42:28,526 --> 00:42:29,694
and to all that I've lost.

446
00:42:32,115 --> 00:42:33,616
Instruments of death

447
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,160
have a powerful connection
to the afterlife.

448
00:42:40,081 --> 00:42:42,500
We hold on to mementos
to help us heal.

449
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:45,086
But sometimes,
they do more harm than good.

450
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,296
Precisely.

451
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,550
So tell me, what do you think
it is you're holding on to?

452
00:42:54,593 --> 00:42:56,219
Have you ever been
to a spiritualist?

453
00:42:58,555 --> 00:42:59,890
But I understand you have.

454
00:42:59,973 --> 00:43:01,224
You know, it is believed

455
00:43:01,308 --> 00:43:03,060
that once we've departed
this world,

456
00:43:03,143 --> 00:43:04,895
we can see others

457
00:43:04,978 --> 00:43:07,397
who have left
their physical selves behind.

458
00:43:07,481 --> 00:43:08,690
Is that right?

459
00:43:08,774 --> 00:43:10,901
Have you ever
experienced such a thing?

460
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:14,029
I can't say that I have, no.

461
00:43:14,696 --> 00:43:16,656
Is it painful to die?

462
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,033
Mrs. Winchester,

463
00:43:18,116 --> 00:43:19,785
we really must continue
with this evaluation.

464
00:43:19,868 --> 00:43:22,245
Please, Doctor. Please.

465
00:43:22,329 --> 00:43:23,789
Yes.

466
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,896
And then nothing.

467
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,441
Just a calmness.

468
00:43:33,026 --> 00:43:36,029
And when I came back,
it was painful again.

469
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,491
If that makes sense.

470
00:43:40,033 --> 00:43:41,034
Yes.

471
00:43:45,038 --> 00:43:47,749
Yes, because you too
have experienced great pain.

472
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:52,546
Grief can be far
more crippling

473
00:43:52,629 --> 00:43:53,755
than arthritis, Doctor.

474
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,925
Mrs. Winchester,
do you blame the shadows

475
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,261
for the loss of your
husband and child?

476
00:44:01,471 --> 00:44:03,598
Were you out of your room
last night?

477
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,737
Yes, I was.

478
00:44:10,821 --> 00:44:12,323
Thank you.

479
00:44:12,406 --> 00:44:14,825
Thank you
for telling me the truth.

480
00:44:26,086 --> 00:44:29,798
So, why all the noise?
Why all this construction?

481
00:44:29,882 --> 00:44:32,259
Sarah: They want me
to build, Doctor.

482
00:44:32,343 --> 00:44:36,013
The spirits killed
by the rifle,

483
00:44:36,096 --> 00:44:38,015
they guide me.

484
00:44:38,098 --> 00:44:40,559
Guide you in drawing
building plans?

485
00:44:40,643 --> 00:44:41,727
Yes.

486
00:44:43,395 --> 00:44:44,563
For what? Why?

487
00:44:44,647 --> 00:44:46,982
For the rooms, of course.

488
00:44:47,066 --> 00:44:49,109
You see, once their rooms
are completed,

489
00:44:49,193 --> 00:44:51,195
their presence grows stronger.

490
00:44:52,905 --> 00:44:54,615
Hence, the house
that spirits built?

491
00:44:54,698 --> 00:44:55,908
Yes.

492
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,744
The shadows that follow me,

493
00:44:58,827 --> 00:45:01,246
they have unfinished business.

494
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:03,791
You saw what I did last night,
didn't you?

495
00:45:04,708 --> 00:45:05,709
I did.

496
00:45:08,045 --> 00:45:09,713
At the chime of midnight,
they clamor.

497
00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:12,758
<i>The bells summon them.</i>

498
00:45:13,676 --> 00:45:19,056
They communicate
through plans, drawings.

499
00:45:19,139 --> 00:45:22,643
<i>They want me to reconstruct
the rooms that they died in,</i>

500
00:45:22,726 --> 00:45:26,188
then they can enter our world.

501
00:45:26,271 --> 00:45:27,606
And the trouble is,
I don't always know

502
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,274
who it is I'm speaking with.

503
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:31,777
It could be some
innocent bystander

504
00:45:32,987 --> 00:45:35,781
<i>or a victim of a crime,</i>

505
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:40,411
or someone else.

506
00:45:40,494 --> 00:45:41,787
Who else, Mrs. Winchester?

507
00:45:43,414 --> 00:45:46,667
Sarah: <i>Last night,</i>
a <i>spirit more powerful</i>

508
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:50,796
than any I've encountered
endangered my family.

509
00:45:52,673 --> 00:45:54,008
Who are you?

510
00:45:56,093 --> 00:46:00,681
Doctor, who do you see
in this room at this moment?

511
00:46:01,849 --> 00:46:02,850
Just you.

512
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:05,728
Onâ€? me?

513
00:46:14,695 --> 00:46:15,821
Just you.

514
00:46:18,323 --> 00:46:20,034
It will take time.

515
00:46:20,117 --> 00:46:21,952
You still need to clear
your head.

516
00:46:42,222 --> 00:46:43,307
Oh, sir!

517
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:45,059
I would like to check in

518
00:46:45,142 --> 00:46:47,186
on Mrs. Marriott
and Master Henry, if I may.

519
00:46:47,269 --> 00:46:49,146
Augustine:
I will inquire, sir.

520
00:46:49,229 --> 00:46:51,148
Eric: Perhaps, may I ask you
a question?

521
00:46:52,441 --> 00:46:53,734
A question, sir?

522
00:46:53,817 --> 00:46:56,320
Yes. I mean, tell me,
have you ever seen any...

523
00:46:57,362 --> 00:46:58,655
Any ghosts?

524
00:46:59,281 --> 00:47:00,407
No, sir.

525
00:47:02,201 --> 00:47:04,536
But you have heard
the rumors, the stories?

526
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:08,373
I have heard tall tales.

527
00:47:08,457 --> 00:47:11,376
Some taller than others.

528
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,046
Have you ever witnessed
anything out of the ordinary?

529
00:47:22,304 --> 00:47:24,765
Sarah: So display cabinets
along the walls,

530
00:47:24,848 --> 00:47:26,975
and then a line of them
down the middle of the room.

531
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:29,394
Yes, ma'am.

532
00:47:29,478 --> 00:47:32,648
And what type of Winchester
would you like delivered?

533
00:47:34,733 --> 00:47:37,319
Every type, every model.

534
00:47:39,613 --> 00:47:42,324
<i>Eric". Okay, let's go back.</i>

535
00:47:42,407 --> 00:47:45,244
Tell me please what happens
once these rooms are finished?

536
00:47:45,327 --> 00:47:47,371
Well, the spirit's
presence grows

537
00:47:47,454 --> 00:47:49,373
more powerful and more...

538
00:47:49,456 --> 00:47:51,125
<i>More focused.</i>

539
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:52,709
<i>Their voices get stronger.</i>

540
00:47:52,793 --> 00:47:54,086
And we converse.

541
00:47:54,169 --> 00:47:56,922
Converse how?
About what?

542
00:47:57,005 --> 00:47:59,424
I show them my deep remorse.

543
00:48:01,218 --> 00:48:04,221
I want to help them let go of
their grief and their anger.

544
00:48:04,304 --> 00:48:05,556
And how do they react?

545
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:09,059
Favorably. Yes, mostly.

546
00:48:09,143 --> 00:48:11,770
Once they are at peace,
then they can move on.

547
00:48:11,854 --> 00:48:15,357
We can tear down their room,
and then we start again.

548
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,026
And are there those that
don't react so favorably?

549
00:48:19,778 --> 00:48:21,613
Yes.

550
00:48:21,697 --> 00:48:23,991
Yes, we lock them away.

551
00:48:24,074 --> 00:48:25,742
How does one lock
a spirit away?

552
00:48:25,826 --> 00:48:29,037
Thirteen nails seals them in.

553
00:48:29,121 --> 00:48:31,165
<i>Once they find peace,
we can release them,</i>

554
00:48:31,248 --> 00:48:33,000
and they can leave this house.

555
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:34,459
Eric: So 13 is

556
00:48:34,543 --> 00:48:36,295
a devilish number to
protect you from devils?

557
00:48:36,378 --> 00:48:39,381
No, no, no.
That is a divine number,

558
00:48:39,464 --> 00:48:42,259
to protect the cycle
of life and death.

559
00:48:42,342 --> 00:48:43,844
And does this divine number
always work?

560
00:48:43,927 --> 00:48:47,973
I mean, what if a spirit simply
doesn't want to be locked away?

561
00:48:49,808 --> 00:48:52,102
The unmendable souls

562
00:48:52,186 --> 00:48:55,439
prey upon the innocent
and the pure.

563
00:48:55,522 --> 00:48:57,983
And by the innocent and pure,
you mean Master Henry?

564
00:49:01,528 --> 00:49:02,988
We can stand between them.

565
00:49:04,031 --> 00:49:05,616
I and you.

566
00:49:06,909 --> 00:49:08,410
With your assistance,

567
00:49:08,493 --> 00:49:11,038
I can help this spirit
find peace.

568
00:49:17,002 --> 00:49:19,087
You don't believe any of this.
I understand.

569
00:49:19,171 --> 00:49:20,923
Ma'am, I do not.

570
00:49:21,006 --> 00:49:26,094
I do not believe in anything
I cannot see or study.

571
00:49:26,178 --> 00:49:28,222
Mrs. Winchester,
you have built this house,

572
00:49:28,305 --> 00:49:30,182
this place, this reality.

573
00:49:30,265 --> 00:49:32,476
Therefore, you can control it,
can you not?

574
00:49:33,393 --> 00:49:35,145
Yes, perhaps.

575
00:49:35,229 --> 00:49:36,563
We all have the ability

576
00:49:36,647 --> 00:49:38,857
to create and control
our own reality.

577
00:49:38,941 --> 00:49:42,236
But for some, for you,
Mrs. Winchester, for you,

578
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,071
that will mean letting go
of the past.

579
00:49:45,739 --> 00:49:47,574
Make your assessment, Doctor.

580
00:49:49,868 --> 00:49:53,914
Say what you feel is the truth
about Sarah Winchester.

581
00:49:53,997 --> 00:49:56,083
And if that means you lose
control of your company?

582
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:01,338
There are worse things in this world
to lose than that, Doctor.

583
00:50:09,096 --> 00:50:10,264
I see you've finished
the new room.

584
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:13,267
John: Of course.

585
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:14,935
Must be very profitable for you,

586
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:18,814
all this working
round the clock.

587
00:50:18,897 --> 00:50:20,357
We all appreciate

588
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:23,443
Mrs. Winchester's
ongoing employment

589
00:50:23,527 --> 00:50:25,070
and her creativity.

590
00:50:26,113 --> 00:50:27,447
I must say, that creativity

591
00:50:27,531 --> 00:50:31,201
certainly leads to some
rather odd designs.

592
00:50:31,285 --> 00:50:33,453
Do you think it possible
a woman of advancing years

593
00:50:33,537 --> 00:50:35,914
may be susceptible
to flights of fancy?

594
00:50:35,998 --> 00:50:38,917
No, sir. I do not.

595
00:50:42,379 --> 00:50:45,215
Could I see inside
the garden room, please?

596
00:50:45,299 --> 00:50:46,967
I had one similar, and I would
be much obliged if...

597
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:49,094
No, sir. That room is sealed.

598
00:50:50,387 --> 00:50:52,097
Therefore, it's off limits.

599
00:50:52,848 --> 00:50:54,808
Good day, Doctor.

600
00:51:00,439 --> 00:51:02,107
Well, Eric,
that's going really well.

601
00:51:16,788 --> 00:51:17,873
How is he?

602
00:51:19,207 --> 00:51:21,418
Fine. Resting.

603
00:51:21,501 --> 00:51:24,129
Has he ever been prone to
behavior like that in the past?

604
00:51:24,629 --> 00:51:26,048
No.

605
00:51:26,131 --> 00:51:27,174
Never?

606
00:51:30,177 --> 00:51:33,847
She told you, didn't she,
about the Winchester curse?

607
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:35,849
Yes.

608
00:51:35,932 --> 00:51:38,310
Do you believe her,
or do you think she's crazy?

609
00:51:38,393 --> 00:51:42,022
I think crazy
is a dangerous word.

610
00:51:42,105 --> 00:51:44,274
People have certain
medical conditions

611
00:51:44,358 --> 00:51:46,693
and with the right
diagnosis and treatment,

612
00:51:46,777 --> 00:51:48,153
they can be helped.

613
00:51:52,866 --> 00:51:54,910
<i>Marion: I do not believe
in curses, Doctor.</i>

614
00:51:55,952 --> 00:51:58,246
Eric: Good. Nor do I.

615
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:00,123
<i>I think perhaps
your son's behavior</i>

616
00:52:00,207 --> 00:52:02,042
<i>has been triggered by the sudden death
of his father.</i>

617
00:52:03,251 --> 00:52:05,128
Marion: Yes.

618
00:52:05,212 --> 00:52:07,214
Eric: <i>Could you tell me
how your husband died?</i>

619
00:52:07,798 --> 00:52:10,592
He had demons,

620
00:52:10,675 --> 00:52:14,179
but not the kind that my aunt
believes haunt her.

621
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:19,101
Eric: Go on.

622
00:52:19,184 --> 00:52:23,313
<i>Marion: Aunt Sarah's husband
died suddenly of tuberculosis.</i>

623
00:52:23,397 --> 00:52:25,190
<i>And then she lost poor Annie.</i>

624
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,361
<i>She believes our family curse
is spreading.</i>

625
00:52:39,788 --> 00:52:42,207
<i>My husband loved the drink</i>

626
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:43,708
more than his wife and child.

627
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:46,378
I believe that was his curse.

628
00:52:48,588 --> 00:52:52,884
Now he is gone, and I'm alone,

629
00:52:52,968 --> 00:52:54,761
better off in so many ways
without him.

630
00:52:56,721 --> 00:52:58,056
But it terrifies me.

631
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,392
Don't let that fear
control you.

632
00:53:01,893 --> 00:53:03,979
Fear only exists in your mind.

633
00:53:04,855 --> 00:53:07,149
When we fear the most,

634
00:53:07,232 --> 00:53:08,942
we must take control.

635
00:53:10,402 --> 00:53:12,737
You can be a fighter.
You can be a protector.

636
00:53:12,821 --> 00:53:14,781
I do not feel like a protector.

637
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:17,534
Aunt Sarah is the fighter.

638
00:53:19,536 --> 00:53:21,371
- Yes.
- She would die to save us.

639
00:53:21,997 --> 00:53:23,915
Perhaps.

640
00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:26,334
Have you ever loved someone so
much you would die to save them?

641
00:53:28,712 --> 00:53:30,881
I have.

642
00:53:30,964 --> 00:53:36,720
I also knew someone who was
haunted by demons, voices.

643
00:53:36,803 --> 00:53:39,473
And did the time ever come
when you had to protect them?

644
00:53:40,557 --> 00:53:41,725
It did.

645
00:53:43,852 --> 00:53:44,978
What did you do?

646
00:53:46,813 --> 00:53:48,106
I died.

647
00:54:13,757 --> 00:54:14,966
Henry!

648
00:54:16,092 --> 00:54:17,177
Ahh!

649
00:54:21,056 --> 00:54:22,057
Henry.

650
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:23,600
Henry!

651
00:54:38,907 --> 00:54:40,116
Henry.

652
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,826
Henry! lt's me!

653
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,064
No.

654
00:55:11,815 --> 00:55:13,400
- Ah!

655
00:55:19,114 --> 00:55:21,032
Henry! Henry!

656
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:25,453
- Henry! Henry!
- Stop it! Stop!

657
00:55:26,329 --> 00:55:27,455
Stop, Henry, stop!

658
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:29,541
- Who are you?
- Die!

659
00:55:41,052 --> 00:55:42,178
Mother?

660
00:55:44,055 --> 00:55:46,016
Oh, Henry.

661
00:55:46,099 --> 00:55:47,851
Henry. Henry.

662
00:55:56,067 --> 00:55:57,277
I'm so sorry, Aunt Sarah.

663
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,903
L've let you down,
and I've let Henry down.

664
00:55:58,987 --> 00:56:01,489
No, no.

665
00:56:01,573 --> 00:56:04,492
This spirit has a power
we've not seen before.

666
00:56:04,576 --> 00:56:06,077
Oh, my God.

667
00:56:07,162 --> 00:56:08,663
It can take over a mind.

668
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:13,627
John, send everyone home.

669
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:15,545
Only we in this room
must remain.

670
00:56:15,629 --> 00:56:16,671
Yes, ma'am.

671
00:56:16,755 --> 00:56:19,257
This child must be taken
to a hospital immediately.

672
00:56:19,341 --> 00:56:21,009
No, no.
We must watch over him.

673
00:56:21,092 --> 00:56:22,218
To a hospital immediately.

674
00:56:22,302 --> 00:56:24,054
No. No one else
will understand.

675
00:56:24,137 --> 00:56:25,180
- He must stay here.
- Eric: This is insanity.

676
00:56:25,263 --> 00:56:26,348
Sarah:
We will watch over him.

677
00:56:26,431 --> 00:56:28,099
Dr. Price may be right.

678
00:56:29,309 --> 00:56:31,061
No. No. We will protect him.

679
00:56:31,144 --> 00:56:32,562
We will protect him
at all costs.

680
00:56:32,646 --> 00:56:33,647
John, come with me.

681
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:34,981
Aunt Sarah!

682
00:56:37,192 --> 00:56:39,778
Ma'am, I insist that
you receive medical treatment.

683
00:56:39,861 --> 00:56:42,697
Seal that door.
Thirteen nails.

684
00:56:42,781 --> 00:56:43,907
Now.

685
00:56:44,824 --> 00:56:45,825
Now!

686
00:56:46,826 --> 00:56:47,827
Yes, ma'am.

687
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:54,834
You leave my family alone.

688
00:56:57,462 --> 00:56:59,339
You speak with me.

689
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,515
Let's just think this through.

690
00:57:08,598 --> 00:57:10,433
Please, Mrs. Marriott,
be rational.

691
00:57:10,517 --> 00:57:13,144
Henry clearly has a trauma
and needs help.

692
00:57:13,228 --> 00:57:14,521
Your aunt is caught
in a superstition.

693
00:57:14,604 --> 00:57:15,855
We need...

694
00:58:04,237 --> 00:58:06,364
Thirteen hooks.

695
00:58:06,448 --> 00:58:08,199
John:
You must listen to me.

696
00:58:08,283 --> 00:58:09,784
Sarah:
ls the rifle room finished?

697
00:58:09,868 --> 00:58:10,952
John: Yes, ma'am.

698
00:58:11,035 --> 00:58:13,121
My God.
This presence is so strong.

699
00:58:13,872 --> 00:58:15,248
Oh, I feel its hatred...

700
00:58:15,331 --> 00:58:16,416
Oh, enough with the games!

701
00:58:16,499 --> 00:58:18,334
We're taking this boy
to a hospital.

702
00:58:18,418 --> 00:58:21,379
- We should listen to him.
- Yes! The boy tried to kill you.

703
00:58:21,463 --> 00:58:23,840
No. The shadows
will follow us.

704
00:58:23,923 --> 00:58:25,341
Wherever we go.

705
00:58:25,425 --> 00:58:27,761
No, Henry will not suffer
the same fate

706
00:58:27,844 --> 00:58:29,095
- as my darling Annie...
- Henry's condition

707
00:58:29,179 --> 00:58:30,346
cannot be cured by witchcraft.

708
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:31,598
The boy needs a doctor.

709
00:58:31,681 --> 00:58:34,100
Conditions can be cured, Doctor.

710
00:58:34,184 --> 00:58:35,894
Curses cannot.

711
00:58:35,977 --> 00:58:37,312
Eric: Mrs. Marriott,
will you please listen to me?

712
00:58:37,395 --> 00:58:38,563
- Marion...
- I'm...

713
00:58:38,646 --> 00:58:39,856
I'm going with Dr. Price.

714
00:58:39,939 --> 00:58:42,150
- No. Henry must stay.
- <i>l'll</i> make the arrangements.

715
00:58:42,233 --> 00:58:43,485
- Gentlemen, you'll excuse me.
- No! No!

716
00:58:43,568 --> 00:58:45,445
Marion, please!
Henry must stay.

717
00:58:45,528 --> 00:58:46,863
He must stay with us.

718
00:58:46,946 --> 00:58:48,406
Aunt Sarah,
I must think of Henry.

719
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:50,116
I should go with him.

720
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,576
I will prove it to you.

721
00:58:53,912 --> 00:58:55,455
Yes, I... I will.

722
00:58:55,997 --> 00:58:57,457
Just wait.

723
00:59:14,349 --> 00:59:15,558
Woman:
Operator.

724
00:59:18,561 --> 00:59:20,230
Winchester Repeating Arms Company.

725
00:59:20,313 --> 00:59:21,773
This is Arthur Gates.

726
00:59:21,856 --> 00:59:24,943
<i>Mr. Gates,
it's Dr. Eric Price here.</i>

727
00:59:25,026 --> 00:59:27,737
I trust the assessment
is going well, Doctor.

728
00:59:27,821 --> 00:59:29,906
<i>I understand you received
our letter.</i>

729
00:59:29,989 --> 00:59:31,616
lt's fine, Mr. Gates.

730
00:59:31,699 --> 00:59:34,828
But I require immediate
transportation to the nearest hospital.

731
00:59:34,911 --> 00:59:36,246
Is everything all right?

732
00:59:36,329 --> 00:59:38,915
Everything is fine. Just please,
a driver, as soon as possible.

733
00:59:38,998 --> 00:59:41,501
- Of course, right away.
- Thank you.

734
00:59:41,584 --> 00:59:43,169
And the assessment, Doctor?

735
00:59:43,253 --> 00:59:44,587
You'll get what you wanted.

736
00:59:46,923 --> 00:59:48,091
Christ!

737
00:59:52,136 --> 00:59:54,472
L'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be rude.

738
00:59:54,556 --> 00:59:58,101
Sir, we're all deeply concerned
for Master Henry's well-being.

739
00:59:58,184 --> 01:00:00,311
If there is anything
I can do to assist you, I...

740
01:00:00,395 --> 01:00:01,521
Well...

741
01:00:02,814 --> 01:00:04,190
Actually, you can.

742
01:00:04,274 --> 01:00:06,359
I need to get my bags, please.

743
01:00:06,442 --> 01:00:08,278
- Of course.
- Thank you.

744
01:00:08,361 --> 01:00:09,654
Happy to help.

745
01:00:14,826 --> 01:00:17,871
<i>Ben: Mrs. Winchester is truly
a remarkable woman.</i>

746
01:00:17,954 --> 01:00:19,706
<i>She knows what she's doing.</i>

747
01:00:19,789 --> 01:00:21,291
She has created a vessel

748
01:00:21,374 --> 01:00:23,167
for the deceased
to communicate with her.

749
01:00:23,251 --> 01:00:24,794
She's certainly created
some architectural oddities.

750
01:00:24,878 --> 01:00:28,047
This house, I've seen things.

751
01:00:30,425 --> 01:00:32,135
Sarah: I know this room.

752
01:00:33,595 --> 01:00:34,596
Things?

753
01:00:35,972 --> 01:00:36,973
The dead.

754
01:00:38,516 --> 01:00:39,601
Criminals.

755
01:00:40,643 --> 01:00:42,520
Lost souls who met
a violent end.

756
01:00:46,691 --> 01:00:49,652
You've seen them,
haven't you?

757
01:00:56,784 --> 01:01:00,163
Dr. Price, many staff
have reported hearing noises.

758
01:01:00,246 --> 01:01:02,957
They come from inside rooms
that have been nailed shut.

759
01:01:03,041 --> 01:01:04,834
Strange occurrences
in those rooms...

760
01:01:04,918 --> 01:01:06,336
That is why the doors have
been sealed,

761
01:01:06,419 --> 01:01:08,838
to keep the unruly in.

762
01:01:08,922 --> 01:01:11,090
But the staff
have only heard noises.

763
01:01:11,174 --> 01:01:13,927
To see them, well,

764
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:15,511
I believe you and I
are unique.

765
01:01:16,304 --> 01:01:17,347
Really?

766
01:01:18,514 --> 01:01:20,141
Yes, perhaps it's all
just a symptom

767
01:01:20,224 --> 01:01:23,061
of Mrs. Winchester's
persuasive influence.

768
01:01:23,144 --> 01:01:25,688
Sir, locking Mrs. Marriott
and her child away

769
01:01:25,772 --> 01:01:27,607
is only delaying
the inevitable.

770
01:01:28,399 --> 01:01:30,401
And what is the inevitable?

771
01:01:30,485 --> 01:01:31,778
They're all Winchester.

772
01:01:31,861 --> 01:01:33,529
They will all die.

773
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:03,559
Mr. Hansen. ls she in there?

774
01:02:03,643 --> 01:02:05,853
- Yes, Doctor.
- Good. You need to hear this.

775
01:02:05,937 --> 01:02:08,022
Mrs. Winchester,
there is a man in your employ

776
01:02:08,106 --> 01:02:09,857
who has clearly lost his mind.
He just...

777
01:02:11,609 --> 01:02:12,902
That's him.

778
01:02:12,986 --> 01:02:15,321
You saw him?
You spoke with him?

779
01:02:15,405 --> 01:02:16,990
Well, yes,
I spoke with him just now.

780
01:02:17,073 --> 01:02:18,324
The man threatened you.

781
01:02:18,408 --> 01:02:20,034
Read it. Read the paper.

782
01:02:23,663 --> 01:02:26,457
"Corporal Benjamin Joseph Block
was killed during a siege

783
01:02:26,541 --> 01:02:28,292
at the Winchester Repeating
Arms general office."

784
01:02:28,376 --> 01:02:29,585
That's impossible.

785
01:02:29,669 --> 01:02:31,921
This newspaper
is 20 years old.

786
01:02:34,507 --> 01:02:36,050
Cruelty, grief, and loss

787
01:02:36,134 --> 01:02:38,469
can make people do
unimaginable things.

788
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:45,268
Ben lost two brothers
on the battlefield.

789
01:02:45,351 --> 01:02:48,271
The youngest was
only 14 years old.

790
01:02:48,354 --> 01:02:50,857
Their Confederate muskets
were no match

791
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,526
for the Winchester rifles
of the Union Army.

792
01:02:54,444 --> 01:02:55,486
They were cut down.

793
01:03:02,535 --> 01:03:04,037
<i>Ben swore revenge.</i>

794
01:03:05,204 --> 01:03:07,415

who created the weapon</i>

795
01:03:07,498 --> 01:03:10,043
<i>that killed his brothers
were as guilty</i>

796
01:03:10,126 --> 01:03:11,836
<i>as those who pulled
the trigger.</i>

797
01:03:21,763 --> 01:03:24,807
He killed 15 innocent people
that day.

798
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,727
He locked himself
in the display room.

799
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:29,854
<i>We used to call it
the show-off room.</i>

No.

814
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:31,541
The one you invite
into your own home.

815
01:04:43,344 --> 01:04:44,428
This is it.

816
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,933
This is the room.

817
01:05:08,578 --> 01:05:11,205
This is an exact replica
of the room he was killed in.

818
01:05:12,123 --> 01:05:13,624
Yes.

819
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:16,961
And now that it is complete,
he is in this world.

820
01:05:17,795 --> 01:05:19,964
Do you see anyone, Doctor?

821
01:05:21,465 --> 01:05:22,842
It's impossible.

822
01:05:22,925 --> 01:05:24,844
Doctor, you must believe.

823
01:05:25,636 --> 01:05:26,846
It's illogical.

824
01:05:37,607 --> 01:05:38,774
Corporal Block,

825
01:05:39,692 --> 01:05:40,985
please,

826
01:05:43,279 --> 01:05:46,199
please feel my deep remorse

827
01:05:46,282 --> 01:05:47,450
for the death of your brothers,

828
01:05:48,993 --> 01:05:52,330
both James and young Harry

829
01:05:52,413 --> 01:05:54,707
by the Winchester rifle.

830
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:58,002
I know all three of you feel
pain and torment.

831
01:05:59,503 --> 01:06:02,173
But violence cannot bring
justice.

832
01:06:02,757 --> 01:06:04,467
Only more suffering,

833
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:08,054
and I will not allow my family
to suffer anymore.

834
01:06:10,765 --> 01:06:13,100
Leave this house
with your brothers.

835
01:06:13,184 --> 01:06:15,895
I hope together
you can find peace.

The farmer's old mule
fell into his well.

Go on, Eric.

873
01:12:31,854 --> 01:12:33,147
The farmer heard...

874
01:12:34,732 --> 01:12:36,025
What?

875
01:12:36,108 --> 01:12:37,359
He heard the mule crying.

876
01:12:38,861 --> 01:12:40,863
And it broke his heart.

877
01:12:40,946 --> 01:12:43,365
Ruby: He chose to bury
the animal in the well

878
01:12:43,449 --> 01:12:45,409
- and put it out of its...
- Its hardship.

879
01:12:47,077 --> 01:12:48,621
He started shoveling.

880
01:12:49,955 --> 01:12:54,251
The mule realized that every
time dirt fell on his back,

881
01:12:54,335 --> 01:12:57,087
he could shake it off
and step up.

882
01:12:57,171 --> 01:12:59,256
Shovel after shovel.

883
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:00,466
He could shake it off

884
01:13:00,549 --> 01:13:02,092
- and he could step up...
- Shake it off.

885
01:13:02,176 --> 01:13:05,220
It wasn't long
before the old mule,

886
01:13:05,304 --> 01:13:08,057
battered and exhausted,

887
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:10,392
stepped over the wall
of that well.

888
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,062
What should have
buried him...

889
01:13:14,563 --> 01:13:17,066
- Saved him.
- And he overcame...

890
01:13:17,149 --> 01:13:18,692
This is not real.

891
01:13:18,776 --> 01:13:20,527
This is not happening.
You are not real.

892
01:13:20,611 --> 01:13:22,404
L've tried to be a good wife.

893
01:13:22,488 --> 01:13:24,490
The voices are
not real, Ruby.

894
01:13:24,573 --> 01:13:25,824
They were never real.

895
01:13:25,908 --> 01:13:27,284
They were just inside
your head.

896
01:13:27,368 --> 01:13:30,329
All these years, all I wanted
was for you to believe me. But...

897
01:13:30,412 --> 01:13:32,414
- I should have put you in care.
- You never did.

898
01:13:32,498 --> 01:13:33,874
I should have put you in care.

899
01:13:33,957 --> 01:13:36,418
Just something that can be
diagnosed and treated,

903
01:13:44,134 --> 01:13:46,178
- Yes.
- That's what you called it.

01:13:46,261 --> 01:13:48,097
Yes. Put the gun down,
Ruby, please.

905

We can talk about this.

906
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,934
I don't want to talk anymore.

907
01:13:52,017 --> 01:13:53,686
I need you to believe me.

908
01:13:53,769 --> 01:13:55,979
I don't know
what I believe anymore.

909

01:21:16,795 --> 01:21:18,588
He's afraid of something.

980
01:21:18,672 --> 01:21:19,881
I felt it.

981
01:21:22,592 --> 01:21:23,927
His gun.

982
01:21:25,846 --> 01:21:27,222
That's 12.

983
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:29,141
This is the gun

984
01:21:33,186 --> 01:21:34,437
he used to kill.

985
01:21:40,861 --> 01:21:42,195
- Do you see him?
- No.

986
01:21:44,614 --> 01:21:46,199
There. Done.

987
01:21:46,283 --> 01:21:47,325
Now he's locked in.

988
01:21:47,409 --> 01:21:48,869
And so are we.

989
01:21:59,212 --> 01:22:01,840
Sarah:
Ben, show yourself.

990
01:22:04,217 --> 01:22:05,302
Show yourself!

991
01:22:39,878 --> 01:22:43,715
Your anger will
never defeat us.

992
01:23:04,277 --> 01:23:06,363
You took everything from me!

993
01:23:14,955 --> 01:23:16,748
They're going right
through him.

994
01:23:16,831 --> 01:23:18,583
- You saw him?
- Yes.

995
01:23:32,973 --> 01:23:33,974
Marion: Who's there?

996
01:23:35,642 --> 01:23:37,143
You're there.

997
01:23:37,227 --> 01:23:39,354
You are there amongst
the dead.

998
01:23:40,605 --> 01:23:41,898
It's not the gun.

999
01:23:41,982 --> 01:23:44,567
He's afraid of something else.

1000
01:23:53,368 --> 01:23:55,996
You kept it
and refurbished it.

1001
01:23:56,079 --> 01:23:57,747
All because it's a reminder
of my past.

1002
01:23:58,832 --> 01:24:00,542
Sarah: Instruments of death

1003
01:24:00,625 --> 01:24:02,544
<i>have a powerful connection
to the afterlife.</i>

1004
01:24:04,379 --> 01:24:07,632
What should have killed him,
saved him.

1005
01:24:17,767 --> 01:24:21,521
Ben, we can help you be free
of your torment.

1006
01:24:28,153 --> 01:24:29,362
L'm a mother...

1007
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:36,411
A fighter.

1008
01:24:40,123 --> 01:24:41,333
Show yourself.

1009
01:24:44,377 --> 01:24:45,545
A protector.

1010
01:24:47,464 --> 01:24:50,216
And I am not afraid.

1011
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:46,898
<i>Ruby: See the truth.</i>

1012
01:26:11,881 --> 01:26:13,049
Yes.

1013
01:26:21,683 --> 01:26:22,934
He's at peace.

1014
01:26:23,977 --> 01:26:25,770
He has joined his brothers.

1015
01:26:27,021 --> 01:26:29,315
You've done it. They're gone.

1016
01:26:35,238 --> 01:26:38,241
Everybody else,
go back to your rooms.

1017
01:26:40,910 --> 01:26:41,953
All of you.

1018
01:27:07,729 --> 01:27:09,272
Henry.

1019
01:27:10,815 --> 01:27:12,192
Henry!

1020
01:27:12,275 --> 01:27:14,360
Henry! Oh, Henry!

1021
01:27:20,241 --> 01:27:22,202
Eric:
Dear Mr. Gates,

1022
01:27:22,285 --> 01:27:24,454
<i>below you will find
my psychological assessment</i>

1023
01:27:24,537 --> 01:27:26,331
<i>and mental status examination</i>

1024
01:27:26,414 --> 01:27:29,626
<i>of Mrs. Sarah Lockwood
Winchester.</i>

1025
01:27:29,709 --> 01:27:32,504
It <i>was</i> conducted at her home
between the dates of April 12

1026
01:27:32,587 --> 01:27:35,381
<i>to April 19, 1906,</i>

1027
01:27:35,465 --> 01:27:36,925
<i>and prepared at the request</i>

1028
01:27:37,008 --> 01:27:39,219
<i>of the Winchester Repeating
Arms Company.</i>

1029
01:27:39,302 --> 01:27:41,429
<i>In my professional opinion,</i>

1030
01:27:41,513 --> 01:27:43,139
<i>after having observed
Mrs. Winchester</i>

1031
01:27:43,223 --> 01:27:44,432
<i>for the past week,</i>

1032
01:27:44,516 --> 01:27:48,102
<i>it is my conclusion that
she is of sound mind and body,</i>

1033
01:27:48,186 --> 01:27:50,355
<i>and is fit to continue
in her role</i>

1034
01:27:50,438 --> 01:27:52,982
<i>with the Winchester
Repeating Arms Company</i>

1035
01:27:53,066 --> 01:27:55,318
<i>for as long as
she desires such a burden.</i>

1036
01:28:00,615 --> 01:28:03,409
<i>Yours truly,
Dr. Eric A. Price.</i>

1037
01:28:21,219 --> 01:28:23,680
It's time for us both
to leave this house.

1038
01:28:26,891 --> 01:28:28,184
<i>L'll</i> always miss you.

1039
01:28:44,534 --> 01:28:47,662
Thank you, Dr. Price,
for your help.

1040
01:28:47,745 --> 01:28:49,080
Young man.

1041
01:28:52,584 --> 01:28:53,668
Thank you.

1042
01:29:08,057 --> 01:29:09,183
Time for me to say goodbye.

1043
01:29:18,776 --> 01:29:20,236
Ruby loves you.

1044
01:29:21,863 --> 01:29:23,865
That did not stop
after her death.

1045
01:29:24,907 --> 01:29:26,451
You know that, don't you?

1046
01:29:28,119 --> 01:29:29,454
I do.

1047
01:29:35,335 --> 01:29:36,919
You know,
in spite of everything,

1048
01:29:39,005 --> 01:29:41,466
you really do have
a beautiful home.

1049
01:29:41,549 --> 01:29:42,884
What are you going to do next?

1050
01:29:44,427 --> 01:29:46,054
Rebuild, of course.

1051
01:29:48,181 --> 01:29:49,432
Of course.
