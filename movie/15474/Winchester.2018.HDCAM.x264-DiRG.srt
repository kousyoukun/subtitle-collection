Henry!

8
00:03:13,546 --> 00:03:14,613
Henry?

00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,246
Henry?

10
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,413
Honey,
What's going on?

11
00:03:35,913 --> 00:03:37,446
What are you doing?

12
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,213
He's coming for us.

<i> SAN FRANCISCO,

I started trembling. <i> OPIUM </ i>

15
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,313
I started to spin.

16
00:04:55,413 --> 00:04:58,213
I was sure everyone
wanted me to kill in the room.

17
00:05:07,113 --> 00:05:08,746
I've never been so scared.

18
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,280
Senseless in the end.
Your fear, is not it?

19
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,880
This is your best
advice, Doctor?

20
00:05:32,946 --> 00:05:34,280
Okay.

21
00:05:40,413 --> 00:05:42,280
What do you think to manage you?

22
00:05:44,013 --> 00:05:46,180
Your body or mind?

23
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,213
= Your money.

24
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:57,080
There you go. - All right, I think
my mind and body work together.

25
00:05:58,013 --> 00:05:59,680
Let's find out.

26
00:06:00,613 --> 00:06:03,746
= Is this really? -Yes. -Yes.

27
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,246
Um...

28
00:06:07,846 --> 00:06:09,546
... is very creative.

29
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:13,446
It can make things

30
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:16,913
the facts are real

31
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:19,880
when they are not really

32
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,113
nothing is the illusion.

33
00:06:24,146 --> 00:06:25,713
Perception...

34
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,280
... truth. -How do you do that?

35
00:06:32,346 --> 00:06:34,413
Sometimes, everyone needs help

36
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,180
to distinguish
reality from illusion.

37
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:42,413
This means take control

38
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:47,380
and do not let
fear manipulate you.

39
00:06:48,713 --> 00:06:51,213
Because the fear in the final
exists only

40
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,113
in your mind.

41
00:06:56,813 --> 00:06:58,580
All right, I'm sorry.

42
00:07:02,513 --> 00:07:04,113
I'm looking for dr. Price.

43
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:06,280
See you.

44
00:07:08,113 --> 00:07:11,913
I am Arthur Gates, Chief Legal Officer
Winchester Wrangler Producer.

45
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:18,446
= Really? -I'm glad. It's hard
it's coming to you, dr. Price. Good night, Nancy. - Good night.
-No.

46
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,746
= Enjoy your vacation.

47
00:07:23,913 --> 00:07:25,580
= Good night.

48
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,346
What do you want? Recipe?
-I've got you a job.

49
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:32,346
Whiskey? -No thanks.

50
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:36,413
Do you know Sarah Winchester,
dr. Price? -Yes.

51
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,546
Her husband, William, was
the main shareholder of Winchester.

52
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:46,813
= Before 25 g. has passed away leaving
her inherent succession

53
00:07:48,013 --> 00:07:52,646
and 51% of the company's ownership.

54
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,446
Ms. Winchester has lost
her daughter's unit, Annie.

55
00:07:56,346 --> 00:07:59,580
In the sadness turned to
media-spiritualists.

56
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,913
It is easy to
use it.

57
00:08:08,046 --> 00:08:11,013
It's not unusual
after the tragedy.

58
00:08:11,746 --> 00:08:13,780


59
00:08:14,513 --> 00:08:18,480
I assure you that Sarah
Winchester is all just unusual.

60
00:08:20,446 --> 00:08:24,080
After meeting with the media
moved to San Jose.

61
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,946
She bought... - Where is she...?......... home with eight rooms.

62
00:08:28,813 --> 00:08:32,213
= Where did they see me? -Something 20 yrs.
has been implemented by upgrading it.

63
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:40,446
Now it's a giant 8-story
building without head and tail.

64
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:45,846
Without any meaningful plan.
Labyrinth of the corridor, all the more nonsense.

65
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,380
A house with no end.

66
00:08:50,146 --> 00:08:52,080
= Built by
mournful widow.

67
00:08:52,613 --> 00:08:55,646
Her mind is
chaotic as well as home.

68
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,680
Over the years, all
more pulls in.

69
00:08:59,346 --> 00:09:02,233
Last month, the management of the company
made the decision

70
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:04,970
to evaluate
its mental state.

71
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,946
To determine whether
is able to manage the company.

72
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,513
Do you want to take her away?

73
00:09:12,946 --> 00:09:15,080
We are concerned about her
mental health, dr. Price.

74
00:09:17,746 --> 00:09:19,213
= We need a professional.

75
00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:24,746
Any diagnosis
would be impossible from here.

76
00:09:25,613 --> 00:09:28,446
Ms. Winchester agreed to
stay on her property.

77
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,146
Such a bid is
extremely rare.

78
00:09:34,213 --> 00:09:39,146
An unwanted patient, on a remote
property,... That's not... -Recort the amount.

79
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,446
I do not do that. - How much do you owe?

80
00:09:43,346 --> 00:09:46,246
For a mortgage,
medical expenses?

81
00:09:47,946 --> 00:09:49,280
Medications?

82
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:52,313
300. -We will pay you 600.

83
00:09:53,713 --> 00:09:55,746
For a quality estimate.

84
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:02,246
= Allow me.

85
00:11:03,313 --> 00:11:04,413
Thanks.

86
00:11:10,146 --> 00:11:13,613
= Today is a business day here. -Yes.
-There is day and night work.

87
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:17,013
Really, and at night? -Constantly.

88
00:11:17,913 --> 00:11:19,013
This way.

89
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,180
Most
rooms do not last long.

90
00:11:24,146 --> 00:11:26,613
= Like the garden.

91
00:11:27,113 --> 00:11:28,913
It may take a season.

92
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,013
= Really?

93
00:11:33,013 --> 00:11:37,146
Wait in the lobby, sir.
I'll call Mrs. Mrs. Marriott.

94
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:40,213
Jesus! - I'm sorry. Doors
produce noise. -It's fine.

95
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:43,580
You scared me.

96
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:55,713
Dr. Price? -Yes. -Welcome. Marion
Marriott, the nephew of Mrs. Winchester.

97
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:02,246
I'm glad. I have not seen
this house yet.

98
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,646
My aunt met me with the
purpose of your visit.

99
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,746
As you know, this is an inconvenient moment.
Please behave accordingly.

100
00:13:11,513 --> 00:13:14,480
Uncomfortable, how?
- Tragedy has occurred.

101
00:13:16,313 --> 00:13:18,613
I'm sorry. Are you armed?

102
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:22,513
Do I need to? -Tet
forbids it.

103
00:13:24,746 --> 00:13:27,613
I am unarmed. -Okay.

104
00:13:28,113 --> 00:13:32,280
You, as well as me, and everyone, we are guests in her
house. You'll respect her rules.

105
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:35,363
Understand. -You will go to
this part of the house, east

106
00:13:35,388 --> 00:13:39,513
wing.

107
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:42,046
Well...

108
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:47,180
You're close to the aunt? - Is this part of your
your estimate? - No, ma'am, it's not.

109
00:13:48,546 --> 00:13:54,046
Yes, Aunt Sarah is an exceptional woman.
She deserves maximum respect.

110
00:13:55,446 --> 00:13:57,880
I understand, ma'am, of course.

111
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,646
= Can I...

112
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:11,946
This is a dance hall. Built almost
completely without the use of a souvenir.

113
00:14:12,546 --> 00:14:15,180
The walls and floor are made of
six different types of wood.

114
00:14:15,946 --> 00:14:18,280
Crystal chandelier is
imported from Germany.

115
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,580
= Follow me the doctor. The house has
almost 100 rooms, it's easy to get lost.

116
00:15:02,213 --> 00:15:04,513
How... unusual?

117
00:15:05,213 --> 00:15:09,246
= Aunt Sarah suffers from arthritis. This
makes it easy to climb stairs.

118
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,746
The house can be quite
demanding, keep up the pace.

119
00:15:19,346 --> 00:15:20,413
What is this?

120
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,146
Communication device.
-Of course?

121
00:15:25,213 --> 00:15:28,746
Speak in the holes, and the sound travels
through the pipes to the desired room.

122
00:15:36,246 --> 00:15:39,480
Ingeniozno. -Yes, I think you'll see
that Aunt has the latest inventions.

123
00:15:40,246 --> 00:15:42,346
I believe that in the room you have
everything you need.

124
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,213
= Aunt Sarah will join us
on dinner.

125
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:47,980
Maybe you want to
refresh before dinner.

126
00:15:48,613 --> 00:15:50,246
I look forward to meeting her.

127
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:54,646
= Aunt Sarah would not look at you
your drinking alcohol before dinner.

128
00:15:55,346 --> 00:15:57,513
The odor of her scent is still
always fragrant as mine.

129
00:15:59,446 --> 00:16:00,846
You respect her wishes.

130
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:14,380
You were right in
about me, Ruby.

131
00:16:18,546 --> 00:16:20,513
I am...

132
00:16:22,713 --> 00:16:23,880
... a file.

133
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:42,246
You are a folirant.

134
00:16:46,946 --> 00:16:48,613
= Good feeling.

135
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,546
Well, you do not know what you're doing.

136
00:17:00,913 --> 00:17:05,646
You do not know what you're doing. Yes. You will not prove anything.

137
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:15,213
= Fine.

138
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,213
Who are you? What do you want? -The daughter
will be served in 10 minutes.

139
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,846
You're here alone. - Yes, sir.
- Nobody but you? -Yes.

140
00:18:15,346 --> 00:18:18,246
Did not you see someone out?
-Are you okay, sir?

141
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,313
I'm fine. It seemed to me
I was someone in the room.

142
00:18:27,513 --> 00:18:31,113
Interesting. - Good,
Dinner in 10 minutes, yes?

143
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:33,613
Yes, sir. -Thank you.

144
00:18:37,013 --> 00:18:40,080
Damn it.

145
00:18:41,046 --> 00:18:42,946
= Only slowly.

146
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:46,480
Yes.

147
00:19:03,513 --> 00:19:04,546
Henry!

148
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,513
Stop it.

149
00:19:16,246 --> 00:19:17,513
Henry, stop it!

150
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,146
Henry! Henry!

151
00:19:25,213 --> 00:19:29,413
Henry! Are you sure you're thrilled
what are you in the dark house?

152
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:33,346
We are here because his father died.

153
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,713
I'm sorry, young man.

154
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:43,813
= I know. -Henry! - My mistake,
I should not have questioned.

155
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,680
Of course it is,
that's why you are here.

156
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,313
Yes. I hope.

157
00:19:52,413 --> 00:19:55,744
= And I recently lost someone.
If you want

158
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:59,704
Talk about it, maybe
you can be helpful.

159
00:20:00,346 --> 00:20:01,946
Or Henry.

160
00:20:03,446 --> 00:20:07,546
You must be good at your job if
your aunt has chosen you to estimate.

161
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,713
I did not know that I personally chose.
I just hope that it can be helpful.

162
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:19,213
If you want to help her, give her aunt a
positive assessment and move on.

163
00:20:20,646 --> 00:20:24,180
I have an obligation to the
profession and to the employer.

164
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,280
Aunt Sarah is your employer.
The company still belongs to her.

165
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:48,546
Veer, ma'am.

166
00:20:52,913 --> 00:20:53,980
Veer, ma'am.

167
00:21:29,113 --> 00:21:32,080
Dr. Price. - Mrs. Winchester,
I'm pleased.

168
00:21:32,746 --> 00:21:36,280
Thanks to
lawyers of Winchester.

169
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,980
Yes. You're right.

170
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:47,346
I hope you are satisfied with the service?
-Full.

171
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,380
= Pretty special house, no?

172
00:21:52,146 --> 00:21:54,646
No further, ma'am.

173
00:21:57,946 --> 00:21:59,346
Thanks.

174
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,246
As far as I understand, the Winchester rifle is still
always superior to others on the market, ma'am.

175
00:22:05,546 --> 00:22:06,880
Superior?

176
00:22:08,413 --> 00:22:09,980
In what way?

177
00:22:11,346 --> 00:22:17,113
Precision, Range, Suspended Power.
-In killing, non-selective.

178
00:22:18,813 --> 00:22:20,480
No offense.

179
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,627
Do you feel responsible for the abusive
your product? -I would not

180
00:22:24,652 --> 00:22:28,137
call it abnormal if
does what it's intended for.

181
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,813
Can be used for good or evil.
Depends on the person who uses it.

182
00:22:36,246 --> 00:22:41,280
Yes, maybe the
wheels are less dangerous.

183
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,346
The company is expanding, searching
other occasions.

184
00:22:45,846 --> 00:22:48,113
As far as I understand, was this your idea, Mrs. Winchester?

185
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,948
Yes, despite the disagreement of the administration.
-It is that

186
00:22:51,973 --> 00:22:56,237
tying the wheels to the legs
is also a risky venture.

187
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:00,913
= Cheers.

188
00:23:20,913 --> 00:23:25,180
Tell me about the old farmer
who has an old mug.

189
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,913
I always liked this story.

190
00:23:29,013 --> 00:23:33,213
Disturbance in understanding reality.
-Yes. - That's what you called it. -Yes.

191
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:39,180
I do not want to talk anymore,
you have to believe me.

192
00:23:40,346 --> 00:23:42,346
<i> Forever expensive. </ i>

193
00:24:11,546 --> 00:24:12,846
Hello?

194

Hello?

195
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,146
What ?!

196
00:27:10,113 --> 00:27:12,880
= You're trying your mind, you're bothering the mind.

197
00:27:13,746 --> 00:27:15,280
Missing.

198
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,346
<i> GARDEN ROOM </ i>

199
00:28:38,213 --> 00:28:39,780
Already seen.

200

I know...

201
00:30:11,213 --> 00:30:12,213
Hey?

202
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:15,580
Hey!

Hey! Get out!

204
00:30:26,813 --> 00:30:28,846
I see you.

205
00:30:33,713 --> 00:30:35,246
Henry!

206
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,980
What's happening to you, honey?

207
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:47,646
Thanks.

208
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,213
Honey, what's going on?

209
00:30:59,913 --> 00:31:04,913
Ms. Winchester, I really need your
full attention. - You have, dr. Price.

210
00:31:05,246 --> 00:31:10,080
Yes, but maybe it would suit you more...
-Town last night was traumatic.

211
00:31:10,713 --> 00:31:17,146
I am grateful to you. I'm afraid
I'm emotionally unprepared today.

212
00:31:17,813 --> 00:31:20,681
Understand. I do not want to ask
whether the young

213
00:31:20,706 --> 00:31:23,104
Henry was inclined
to the moonlight in the past?

214
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
No.

215
00:31:26,513 --> 00:31:29,180
You may know
attended your father's death.

216
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,080
Yes.

217
00:31:33,713 --> 00:31:36,640
This will be the first in a series of
sessions that I want to implement.

218
00:31:36,665 --> 00:31:39,704
I assure you that today's
will be pretty harmless.

219
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:45,080
= Let's go straight to the point, Doctor. Here
to re-examine my humble behavior, right?

220
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:50,046
I would not call it that way.
-I'll be honest with you.

221
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,513
= Please. -You will return
with the same measure. -Of course.

222
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:56,780
Do you suffer from a military syndrome?

223
00:31:57,346 --> 00:32:00,446
= Excuse me? - Are you
drug dependent?

224
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:04,646
Ms. Winchester, maybe it's best
I'm asking questions. -Your wife,

225
00:32:05,246 --> 00:32:08,413
Did she think you are a good psychiatrist?
- I'm not here to discuss it.

226
00:32:08,746 --> 00:32:10,813
Your wife, Ruby?

227
00:32:13,246 --> 00:32:16,513
No, you are not. I will be
grateful for your sincerity.

228
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,946
Are you addicted to drugs?
-No, I'm not.

229
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:28,558
Well... -I'll share
something with you what

230
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:31,437
will be questionable, but
I assure you that's the case.

231
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,813
= Please. -I'm damned.

232
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,246
How are you cursing? - Did
read the papers?

233
00:32:38,713 --> 00:32:43,580
= Of course. - What's in them? -Immediately
that this house is built by the ghosts.

234
00:32:43,913 --> 00:32:47,746
See, earn
on violence and death,

235
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,847
it's a dread that
follows you like a shadow.

236
00:32:52,872 --> 00:32:55,737
It says in the notes that you are suffering
from guilt to shadows.

237
00:32:56,946 --> 00:33:00,134
Tell me how those shadows follow you?
-I may have grown old,

238
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,237
but I assure you that I did not
lose touch with reality.

239
00:33:03,613 --> 00:33:06,846
I know the difference between
illusion and reality.

240
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,280
So then.

241
00:33:12,146 --> 00:33:14,946
= Your mind manages the body.

242
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:21,580
The mind can be very creative. But with
time on time it can let us down.

243
00:33:22,213 --> 00:33:26,980
It was never me. -What we see, taste and touch

244
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,517
has been processed and interpreted
to shape

245
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:33,604
reality. And this reality
can become an illusion.

246
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,413
Created and distorted by sorrow.

247
00:33:41,946 --> 00:33:44,213
Do you believe in ghosts,
dr. Price?

248
00:33:45,146 --> 00:33:46,913
No, why?

249
00:33:47,646 --> 00:33:50,831
My staff would be
grateful to that wallet. Even

250
00:33:50,856 --> 00:33:53,870
and the coin you hid in
it would be a good start.

251
00:33:57,213 --> 00:33:58,713
Funny illusions?

252
00:33:59,113 --> 00:34:02,133
You think I'm a fool? -No, Ms.
-Stop

253
00:34:02,158 --> 00:34:04,304
with games and salon tricks.

254
00:34:04,913 --> 00:34:09,102
We will have to take your medication. -Where
Winchester, I'm sorry, but I insist,

255
00:34:09,127 --> 00:34:13,204
= I'm not a child... -This is my house, Dr.
Price, you will respect my rules!

256
00:34:14,713 --> 00:34:18,113
If you want to open this
home you have to be a clear mind.

257
00:34:22,746 --> 00:34:24,213
Do you have any further questions?

258
00:34:26,646 --> 00:34:27,980
= Yes, ma'am.

259
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,813
Is it really necessary
to be closed in the room?

260
00:34:35,246 --> 00:34:36,813
= So it wants to be, sir.

261
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,246
How's Henry? And he
is locked in the room.

262
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,680
Mrs. Marriott does not
let her out of sight.

263
00:35:31,313 --> 00:35:34,992

I feel their presence.
Their energy.

274
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,380
This is because of
unfinished jobs.

275
00:36:43,713 --> 00:36:46,880
Maybe you blame them for the
death of a husband and a child?

276
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,113
I'll be banging for William and
Annie for the rest of my life.

277
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:57,213
I very much love my family, dr. Price.
It is the true riches of my life.

278
00:36:58,013 --> 00:37:00,680
I will do everything
to protect it.

279
00:37:15,413 --> 00:37:18,346
Why are the bells ringing at midnight?

280
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,846
It's midnight, sir.

281
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,480
Yes, but...

282
00:37:24,246 --> 00:37:25,913
... is there any reason?

283
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,413
It's midnight, sir.

284
00:37:32,513 --> 00:37:33,680
Thanks.

285
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,646
I'm still influenced by opium.

286
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:05,046
I just need to clean it.
It's safe.

287
00:41:11,613 --> 00:41:13,313
I have a question for you, dr. Price.

288
00:41:13,813 --> 00:41:16,646
Maybe it's best to ask me questions.
-What's it like to die?

289
00:41:17,413 --> 00:41:20,480
Let's talk about... - Were you
dead three minutes?

290
00:41:25,246 --> 00:41:27,646
You know, I keep records

291
00:41:28,646 --> 00:41:31,213
about all life-seized
Winchester rifle.

292
00:41:32,146 --> 00:41:35,413
Hundreds are reported.
Thousands are probably not.

293
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,080
Blame or innocent, the rifle does not choose.

294
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,213
Many souls came to this house.

295
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,346
Impressive.

296
00:41:47,313 --> 00:41:52,980
But as you can see, I'm still alive
and you can remove me from this shelf.

297
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,413
= Have you been hacked? -I did.

298
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,346
= With this bullet.

299
00:42:06,413 --> 00:42:08,480
He killed me.

300
00:42:13,346 --> 00:42:16,113
You held it. And restored?

301
00:42:17,146 --> 00:42:18,713
= I did. -Why?

302
00:42:19,646 --> 00:42:21,913
That's my memory.

303
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:26,080
My connection with death and
all that I lost.

304
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:32,880
Death instruments have a strong
connection with a life-threatening life.

305
00:42:36,446 --> 00:42:41,413
We keep in mind that it is easier to recover,
but sometimes we are more damaging than using it.

306
00:42:42,213 --> 00:42:46,580
= That's right. Tell me
what are you holding for?

307
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,813
Have you ever been a spiritualist?

308
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:00,613
As far as I understand, you are. -We believe
when we leave this world we can see

309
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:06,913
die. - Really? Did you ever experience something like that?

310
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,580
I can not say that I am.

311
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:15,461
= Is it painful to die? - Right
Winchester, you really should

312
00:43:15,486 --> 00:43:19,604
= need... - Please,
Doctor, please! -Yes.

313
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,480
And then nothing.

314
00:43:26,413 --> 00:43:27,813
Just calm.

315
00:43:29,613 --> 00:43:32,313
When I regained
it was again painful.

316
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:37,113
If that makes sense to you. -Yes.

317
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:46,080
Yes, because you too felt great pain?
-Tuga...

318
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,946
... can be much more painful
from arthritis, Doctor.

319
00:43:51,313 --> 00:43:54,613


320
00:43:57,613 --> 00:43:59,580
Miss Winchester, do you blame the shadows
for the death of your husband and child?

321
00:44:04,813 --> 00:44:06,480
= Did you leave the room last night?

322
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:10,546
= Yes, I did.

323
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:27,680
Thanks. Thank you for
telling me the truth.

324
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,613
Well, what's all this noise and construction?
-They want to build, Doctor.

325
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,480
Ghosts killed with a rifle.
They lead me.

326
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,580
Does it lead you to draw
building plans? -Yes.

327
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,046
Why? - For the room, of course.

328
00:44:49,013 --> 00:44:51,580
When rooms build
their presence stronger.

329
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,693
Therefore the name "The house
was built by ghosts."

330
00:44:56,718 --> 00:44:59,804
Shadows that follow me. They have
unfinished jobs.

331
00:45:01,113 --> 00:45:02,380
You saw that I
worked last night, did not I?

332
00:45:04,213 --> 00:45:06,413
= I did.

333
00:45:07,146 --> 00:45:09,313
The bell calls them.

334
00:45:10,213 --> 00:45:14,313
They announce my plans and drafts.

335
00:45:15,146 --> 00:45:21,280
They want to reconstruct the rooms where
they died. That I can enter our world.

336
00:45:22,313 --> 00:45:28,280
The problem is I do not know who I'm talking to.
Maybe it's an innocent observer

337
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:32,680
or a victim of a crime, or...

338
00:45:34,946 --> 00:45:37,546
... somebody else.

339
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,480
Last night, the spirit of the more powerful
than all the previous ones,

340
00:45:44,946 --> 00:45:47,080
= jeopardized my family.

341
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,613
Who are you?

342
00:45:52,213 --> 00:45:56,713
Doctor, who do you see
in this room, now?

343
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,113
Just you.

344
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,813
= Just me?

345
00:46:11,546 --> 00:46:12,680
Just you.

346
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:18,246
= It'll take a long time. While
does not clear up.

347
00:46:38,646 --> 00:46:43,013
Sir, I want to check
how are Mrs. Marriott and Henry.

348
00:46:43,413 --> 00:46:47,480
I'll ask, sir.
-May I ask you something?

349
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,880
Question, sir? -Yes,
did you see...

350
00:46:53,446 --> 00:46:56,446
... ghosts? - No, sir.

351
00:46:58,046 --> 00:47:00,413
But you heard rumors and stories?

352
00:47:01,113 --> 00:47:03,313
I heard the story of the bogeyman.

353
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:06,480
= Some more incredible than others.

354
00:47:07,513 --> 00:47:10,080
= Did you testify?

355
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:23,546
Display cabinets next to the wall,
and then the middle of the room.

356
00:47:24,113 --> 00:47:28,713
= Yes, ma'am. What kind of
gun you want?

357
00:47:30,913 --> 00:47:33,546
All types, all models.

358
00:47:35,846 --> 00:47:37,546
All right, repeat.

359
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,613
Tell me what's happening
when you finish the rooms?

360
00:47:41,246 --> 00:47:46,080
Presence of Strength, becoming
more focused.

361
00:47:47,213 --> 00:47:50,013
The voice becomes louder.
We are talking.

362
00:47:50,613 --> 00:47:52,880
How? About what?

363
00:47:53,313 --> 00:47:55,646
I'm telling my conscience.

364
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:00,113
I want to help them
get rid of sorrows and anger.

365
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,846
How do they react? -Positive,

366
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,041
most of them. Once they find peace,
I can go on.

367
00:48:07,066 --> 00:48:09,904
Then we can drop the
room and build a new one.

368
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,980
Are there any who do not
react positively?

369
00:48:15,813 --> 00:48:16,913
Yes.

370
00:48:17,646 --> 00:48:21,413
Yes, we are locking them.
-How to close the ghost?

371
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:28,213
13 Squares closes them. Once
settled down, we release them and leave the house.

372
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,213
So 13 is the hell of
that keeps you from hell.

373
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,780
No, that's God's number.

374
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:39,646
Protects the circle of life and death.
-Does it always turn on?

375
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:43,446
What if a ghost does not want to be closed?

376
00:48:45,813 --> 00:48:51,013
Incomplete souls are lurking
innocent and clean.

377
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,846
Under this, do you mean Henry?

378
00:48:57,513 --> 00:48:59,013
We can confront him.

379
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,380
= Me and you.

380
00:49:02,846 --> 00:49:06,546
With your help, you can
help him find peace.

381
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:16,046
You do not believe in anything, I understand.
-No, ma'am.

382
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,980
I do not believe in anything that I do not
see and can not study.

383
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,202
Ms. Winchester, you
built this place.

384
00:49:25,227 --> 00:49:28,070
It gives you the ability to
manage it, no?

385
00:49:29,346 --> 00:49:33,134
Yes, somewhat. - We can
somehow build our own

386
00:49:33,159 --> 00:49:37,237
reality. But for some, for you...
For you, Mrs. Winchester,

387
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:40,146
this means that you will have to
free up the past.

388
00:49:41,546 --> 00:49:44,080
= Estimate, Doctor.

389
00:49:45,646 --> 00:49:49,246
Say what you think
that is true about me.

390
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:53,513
If this means you will lose
the management of the company?

391
00:49:54,046 --> 00:49:56,780
There are even worse things
from that, Doctor.

392
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,913
I see you finished a new room?
- Sure.

393
00:50:09,413 --> 00:50:11,013
You must be worth it?

394
00:50:12,213 --> 00:50:13,813
= Continuous construction?

395
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:18,080
We are grateful to Mrs.
Winchester is at work.

396
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,046
And on her creativity.

397
00:50:22,113 --> 00:50:25,646
I have to admit that its creativity
leads to pretty strange solutions.

398
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:31,246
Do you think the woman of her
years is prone to fantasies?

399
00:50:32,346 --> 00:50:34,346
= No, sir. I do not think.

400
00:50:38,313 --> 00:50:41,749
Can I look at the garden room?
I had a similar...

401
00:50:41,774 --> 00:50:44,437
- No, sir, this
room is sealed.

402
00:50:46,446 --> 00:50:47,913
It is inaccessible.

403
00:50:49,013 --> 00:50:50,546
= I wish you a nice day, Doctor.

404
00:50:56,346 --> 00:50:58,613
Well, that's a good thing.

405
00:51:12,913 --> 00:51:14,380
How is it?

406
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:19,446
Good, rest. Did he
show such behavior earlier?

407
00:51:20,713 --> 00:51:21,780
No.

408
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,346
Never.

409
00:51:26,013 --> 00:51:29,580
She told you? For the curse?

410
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:31,246
Yes.

411
00:51:31,846 --> 00:51:33,780
Believe it or
think it's crazy?

412
00:51:34,413 --> 00:51:37,046
= I think it's a crazy word.

413
00:51:37,946 --> 00:51:40,580
People suffer from
certain disorders.

414
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,280
With correct diagnosis and
treatment can be helpful.

415
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,946
I do not believe in
curses, Doctor.

416
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,580
Good. Me neither.

417
00:51:54,113 --> 00:51:58,213
Maybe your son's behavior
is triggered by the sudden death of a father?

418
00:51:59,446 --> 00:52:00,780
Yes.

419
00:52:01,513 --> 00:52:03,113
Can you tell me how he died?

420
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:05,680
He had demons.

421
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:10,013
But not the kind of
my aunt believes.

422
00:52:13,146 --> 00:52:14,213
Continue.

423
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,913
Tetin's husband was suddenly
dying of tuberculosis.

424
00:52:18,946 --> 00:52:21,280
And then poor Annie.

425
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,680
She believes
our curse is spreading.

426
00:52:35,646 --> 00:52:39,246
My husband loved
a drink from wife and son.

427
00:52:40,546 --> 00:52:41,913
It was his curse.

428
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:48,213
Now that it's gone and I'm alone,

429
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,613
I look a lot better,

430
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:55,646
but I'm scared. Do not
allow fear to govern you.

431
00:52:57,513 --> 00:52:59,746
It exists only in your mind.

432
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:04,246
When we are afraid of the most
we have to take control.

433
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:10,313
You can be a fighter and a patron.
-I do not feel like a patron.

434
00:53:11,946 --> 00:53:14,013
= Aunt Sarah is a fighter.

435
00:53:15,513 --> 00:53:17,346
She would give life to us.

436
00:53:18,013 --> 00:53:21,613
Maybe. Have you ever loved someone
enough to give life to him?

437
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,780
= I did.

438
00:53:26,713 --> 00:53:29,846
I also knew someone
who were persecuted by demons.

439
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:35,080
Voices. - Did the moment
come in when you had to protect them?

440
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,780
= I did.

441
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,913
What did you do?

442
00:53:42,746 --> 00:53:44,080
I died.

443
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,841
Henry?
Do not!

444
00:54:17,313 --> 00:54:18,313
Henry?

445
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:19,780
Henry?

446
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,446
Henry, that's me.

447
00:55:06,046 --> 00:55:07,380
Do not.

448
00:55:15,246 --> 00:55:17,680
Henry! Henry!

449
00:55:21,446 --> 00:55:24,280
= Speak your son! - Who are you?

450
00:55:25,246 --> 00:55:27,346
= Die! Die!

451
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,113
Mother?

452
00:55:40,013 --> 00:55:41,680
Oh, Henry.

453
00:55:52,213 --> 00:55:54,980
I'm sorry, Auntie. I've lost
myself and Henry.

454
00:55:55,546 --> 00:55:59,180
No. This spirit has the power
uninvited so far. Can.

455
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,613
God!

456
00:56:02,713 --> 00:56:04,546
Can master the mind.

457
00:56:07,213 --> 00:56:12,080
John, send it home. We will remain
only we, from this room. - Yes, ma'am.

458
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,426
The child should be taken to the hospital immediately.
-No, no,

459
00:56:15,451 --> 00:56:17,784
we will monitor him.
-In the hospital, now!

460
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:20,368
No, nobody else will understand.
Must stay here

461
00:56:20,393 --> 00:56:22,894
here. -Sarah! -Dr. Price
may be right!

462
00:56:24,913 --> 00:56:27,980
No, we will protect it.
At all costs.

463
00:56:28,446 --> 00:56:30,080
John, come.
- Dad Sarah?

464
00:56:33,013 --> 00:56:36,080
Ma'am, I insist you get a doctor's
treatment. -Turn this door.

465
00:56:36,913 --> 00:56:38,446
13 souvenirs, now.

466
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:41,246
Immediately. Immediately!

467
00:56:42,513 --> 00:56:43,646
= Yes, ma'am.

468
00:56:49,046 --> 00:56:50,613
Leave my family alone!

469
00:56:53,013 --> 00:56:54,880
= Talk to me!

470
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:03,813
Consider this.

471
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,580
Mrs. Marriott, please,
be reasonable. Henry...

472
00:57:07,113 --> 00:57:10,546
... is obviously investigated and need
help. Your aunt is a victim of superstition.

473
00:58:00,213 --> 00:58:03,013
13 oaks. - Listen to me!

474
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,913
Is the rifle room finished?
-Yes, ma'am.

475
00:58:06,613 --> 00:58:08,646
God, the presence is so strong.

476
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,580
= I feel hatred. -Good games!

477
00:58:12,213 --> 00:58:14,546
Take the boy to the hospital!
-Hear him!

478
00:58:15,046 --> 00:58:18,680
Yes, the boy tried to kill you!
-No, the shadows will follow us,

479
00:58:19,513 --> 00:58:23,046
wherever they went. No, Henry
will not experience the same fate...

480
00:58:23,113 --> 00:58:24,960
... like my dear Annie.
- His illness can not be cured!
He needs medical help!

481
00:58:24,985 --> 00:58:27,037
Illness can be cured
, Doctor!

482
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,280
= Not a curse! -My Marriott,
Please, listen to me!

483
00:58:29,746 --> 00:58:32,580
Marion... - I'm coming with dr. Price.
-You have to stay!

484
00:58:32,846 --> 00:58:35,913
I will do everything. -No!
-Man, excuse me.

485
00:58:36,413 --> 00:58:39,946
Henry must stay. She has to stay with us!
- Dad, I have to think of him. I have to go.

486
00:58:39,946 --> 00:58:44,613
I'll prove it to you.

487
00:58:45,846 --> 00:58:47,480
The letter I wrote.

488
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,480
= Just wait.

489
00:58:52,013 --> 00:58:53,080
<i> The central station? </ i>

490
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:11,213
Winchester weapons,
Arthur Gates here.

491
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,313
<i> Mr. Gates, Dr.
Eric Price here. </ i>

492
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,946


493
00:59:20,513 --> 00:59:25,113
I believe that the assessment goes according to the plan,
Doctor? <i> You received our letter? </ i>

494
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:29,946
It's okay, Mr. Gates. I need
urgent transportation to the nearest hospital.

495
00:59:30,413 --> 00:59:33,980
= Is everything okay? -Yes. Just
send the driver as soon as possible.

496
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:38,213
Of course, now. <i> Thank you. </ i>
-An assessment?

497
00:59:38,713 --> 00:59:40,180
You will get what you want.

498
00:59:42,546 --> 00:59:43,646
Kriste!

499
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:50,213
= Excuse me, I did not want...
- Sir,

500
00:59:50,646 --> 00:59:53,180
= = We are all concerned about Henry.

501
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,813
If I can help you anyway?

502
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:00,946
Actually you can. I need
my bags, please.

503
01:00:01,846 --> 01:00:04,480
Resolved. Thank you. -Good
I can help.

504
01:00:10,113 --> 01:00:12,680
Mrs Winchester is an exceptional woman.

505
01:00:13,213 --> 01:00:14,513
He knows what he's doing.

506
01:00:15,313 --> 01:00:17,805
Has created a pass through which
deceased can communicate with

507
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:20,213
us. She's surely made
architectural strangeness.

508
01:00:20,213 --> 01:00:21,746
This house...

509
01:00:22,446 --> 01:00:23,780
I saw things.

510
01:00:26,213 --> 01:00:27,713
I know this room.

511
01:00:29,013 --> 01:00:30,113
Things?

512
01:00:31,313 --> 01:00:33,146
Dead.

513
01:00:33,946 --> 01:00:35,046
= Utvare.

514
01:00:35,746 --> 01:00:37,646
The lost souls that
were violently ending.

515
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,213
You saw them.

516
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,313
Is not it?

517
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:54,780
Dr. Price, the servants heard the noise.

518
01:00:55,246 --> 01:00:57,513
Comes from the dormant rooms.

519
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:03,113
The strange events in these rooms are the reason
that they are stuck, to keep the restless souls.

520
01:01:04,013 --> 01:01:07,213
But the service only heard noise.
To see them...

521
01:01:07,713 --> 01:01:10,880
I believe that you and I are special.

522
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,046
= Really?

523
01:01:13,746 --> 01:01:17,280
= Yes, maybe it is just a symptom of Mrs. Winchester's conviction?

524
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:22,413
Sir, the lockdown of Mrs. Mary
and her son just postpone inevitably.

525
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,313
What is inevitable?

526
01:01:25,913 --> 01:01:28,413
They are all Winchesters.
Everyone will die!

527
01:01:56,913 --> 01:02:00,613
Hansen, is she in? - Yes, Doctor.
- Okay, this should be heard.

528
01:02:01,113 --> 01:02:05,213
Ms. Winchester, in your service is a
man who apparently crazy. It's just...

529
01:02:06,913 --> 01:02:09,080
It's him!

530
01:02:09,713 --> 01:02:13,046
You spoke ?! - Sure, just a little bit.
He was sorry for you.

531
01:02:13,546 --> 01:02:15,480
= Read. Read the newspaper.

532
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,437
<i> Descendant Benjamin Joseph
Block was killed during </ i>

533
01:02:21,462 --> 01:02:24,070
<i> siege of Winchester's seat. </ i>
It's impossible.

534
01:02:24,646 --> 01:02:27,046
These newspapers are 20 years old.

535
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:33,713
Cruelty, grief, and loss can
push people to invisible things.

536
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:42,346
Ben lost two brothers on the battlefield.
Young was only 14 years old.

537
01:02:43,713 --> 01:02:48,513
Their confederate muscles could not
be measured with the Winchester guns of the Union Army.

538
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:51,080
They were scratched.

539
01:02:57,713 --> 01:02:59,746
Ben decided on revenge.

540
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,013
He is the creator of the weapon that
killed his brothers

541
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,746
They were just as guilty as those
who pulled the trigger.

542
01:03:16,913 --> 01:03:20,080
He killed 15 innocent
people of that day.

543
01:03:21,313 --> 01:03:24,813
He locked himself in the exhibition room which
we called a bouncy room.

544
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:30,113
<i> We know you're in! </ I>

545
01:03:30,613 --> 01:03:34,913
<i> Beautiful dream come to me </ i>

<i> Nothing can miss my
/> people and their Winchester. </ i>

549
01:03:46,752 --> 01:03:49,704
= Cover me!

550
01:03:49,713 --> 01:03:51,680
This way, when the bell rings at midnight,
will be at the peak of its power.

551
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:16,080
Do you know which monster is
the most terrible, Doctor?

552
01:04:17,146 --> 01:04:20,680
No.

553
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:22,813
The one you invite to your home.

554
01:04:23,846 --> 01:04:26,780
That's it.

555
01:04:39,046 --> 01:04:40,913
This is the room.

556
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:43,980


557
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:06,346
Exact copy of the

558
01:05:07,246 --> 01:05:11,946
Yes. And now that it is finished,
it is in our world.

559
01:05:12,946 --> 01:05:14,980
Do you see anyone, Doctor?

560
01:05:16,513 --> 01:05:19,413
= Not possible.

561
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,113
The contrary is reasonable.

562
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:34,013
Ten Block,

563
01:05:34,846 --> 01:05:35,980
Please,

564
01:05:38,446 --> 01:05:40,680
Please, receive my
deepest sympathy

565
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:43,080
because of your brothers' death.

566
01:05:44,146 --> 01:05:46,713
James and young Harry,

567
01:05:47,546 --> 01:05:49,313
killed by Winchester rifle.

568
01:05:50,013 --> 01:05:52,980
I know that all three
feel pain and suffering.

569
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,946
But violence is not the way to justice.

570
01:05:58,046 --> 01:06:02,980
= Only causes additional suffering. I will not
allow my family to suffer because of that.

571
01:06:05,646 --> 01:06:10,913
Leave home, along with brothers.
I hope you will find peace together.

No. - I always
loved this story.

= They built our garden room.

598
01:12:19,013 --> 01:12:21,579
Farmer's old mazga
infiltrated into the well.

599
01:12:23,246 --> 01:12:25,146
= Come on, Eric.

600
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:28,979
Farmer heard...

=...... how the mula recalls.

602
01:12:33,613 --> 01:12:39,679
That broke his heart. - He decided
to fill the well to give her... -Shut up trouble.

603
01:12:41,579 --> 01:12:43,713
He started to bury the shovel.

604
01:12:44,679 --> 01:12:48,013
Mazga realized that every time
her land purchases on her back

605
01:12:48,913 --> 01:12:51,546
could shake and climb onto her.

606

The shovel shovel,
would shake it off.

607
01:12:56,979 --> 01:13:04,613
It was not long gone until the old mazga, exhausted
and exhausted, did not come out of the well

608
01:13:06,079 --> 01:13:08,113
in which it should
be buried.

609
01:13:09,146 --> 01:13:14,913

real. It's not helping. You are not real!

610
01:13:15,313 --> 01:13:18,609
= I tried to be a good woman.
-Glasses are not real,

Ruby. They've never been.
Just in your head.

All these years, only
I wanted to

give it to the institution. -... you never did.

614
01:13:26,946 --> 01:13:30,066
I should have put you in the institution.
-What can something

01:13:30,091 --> 01:13:33,037
be found and treated as
any other form of madness?

616
01:13:33,313 --> 01:13:35,813
= Yes, yes, I should. I made a mistake.
I'm sorry.

617
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:40,146
Disturbance in understanding reality.
-Yes. - That's what you called it. -Yes.

talk more. I want you to trust me.

01:13:48,579 --> 01:13:50,479
I do not know what else I believe.

621
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:55,646
Someone like you will never do it.
-Please, Ruby.

You can continue.

625

Mrs. Winchester, are you okay? -This
spirit destroys the balance in the house.

630
01:16:55,779 --> 01:16:57,446
We have to stop it.

631
01:17:04,146 --> 01:17:06,213
We have to find Marion and Henry.

632
01:17:07,513 --> 01:17:09,446
= Close this door.

633
01:17:10,746 --> 01:17:12,779
Ben can not leave.

634
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:19,979
<i> Beautiful dream come to me </ i> -Henry?

635
01:17:22,146 --> 01:17:25,779
<i> Starlight
that clouds the clouds </ i>

636
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:06,113
Sit down.

637
01:18:10,946 --> 01:18:14,113
Sarah, I can see them.
I see them all!

638
01:18:14,813 --> 01:18:16,546
You are the only one who can.

639
01:18:17,613 --> 01:18:21,346
Do you believe?

640
01:18:22,179 --> 01:18:26,279
You were dead for three minutes.
Winchester shot dead.

641
01:18:27,513 --> 01:18:29,646
You are connected to the house.

642
01:18:31,179 --> 01:18:32,613
Yes.

643
01:18:40,179 --> 01:18:41,346
Henry?

644
01:18:44,013 --> 01:18:45,346
= Where are you?

645
01:18:51,546 --> 01:18:52,879
= Where are you?

646
01:18:54,913 --> 01:18:57,946
I will not... I will not allow
that fear will manage me.

647
01:19:08,613 --> 01:19:09,813
Henry!

648
01:19:10,613 --> 01:19:11,746
Henry!

649
01:19:14,913 --> 01:19:17,646
Oh, please! Please
you, come back to me.

650
01:19:26,446 --> 01:19:30,679
Marion and Henry are in great danger.
The only way to save them is

651
01:19:31,313 --> 01:19:34,046
Let's stop it here and now.

652
01:19:36,813 --> 01:19:38,979
Ben, leave my
family alone!

653
01:19:42,346 --> 01:19:44,613
Talk to me.

654
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:47,379
Speak to me!

655
01:19:50,813 --> 01:19:51,979
Now.

656
01:20:02,346 --> 01:20:03,413
Sarah?

657
01:20:04,846 --> 01:20:07,213
The Ten Commandment Block is in this room.

658
01:20:12,679 --> 01:20:18,113
Winchester took away everything at war!
The house must die! -Sarah, fight!

659
01:20:19,179 --> 01:20:22,818
My brothers were killed by a rifle.
They died by the instrument of death!

660
01:20:22,843 --> 01:20:25,970
Fight! - Who
killed your wife!

661
01:20:30,946 --> 01:20:32,813
= Check it out!

662
01:20:33,813 --> 01:20:35,233
Presence! -I want to suffer!

663
01:20:37,379 --> 01:20:42,413
Marion is mine! Henry is mine!
Eye for an eye!

664
01:20:43,179 --> 01:20:46,813
Get off! -This company
will not make money on death!

665
01:20:47,579 --> 01:20:49,646
Sarah, fight! -Never again!

666
01:20:56,446 --> 01:21:00,079
= Zakucite pod, doktore!
13 cavala, hurry!

667
01:21:01,646 --> 01:21:03,679
His anger is endless.

668
01:21:05,179 --> 01:21:07,113
But we can stop it. -How?

669
01:21:07,513 --> 01:21:08,846
Nothing...

670
01:21:09,713 --> 01:21:12,279
= Nothing in this room.
It's scared of something.

671
01:21:13,046 --> 01:21:14,446
I felt it.

672
01:21:17,213 --> 01:21:18,779
His rifle.

673
01:21:20,279 --> 01:21:21,613
Twelve.

674
01:21:22,579 --> 01:21:24,113
The rifle...

675
01:21:27,613 --> 01:21:29,579
... that he killed.

676
01:21:34,946 --> 01:21:36,946
Do you see it? -Not.

677
01:21:38,879 --> 01:21:41,179
Completed. - It's locked.

678
01:21:41,979 --> 01:21:44,113
And we are.

679
01:21:53,446 --> 01:21:56,079
Ben, show up.

680
01:21:58,246 --> 01:21:59,879
Show me!

681
01:22:34,579 --> 01:22:37,713
Your anger will never
win us.

682
01:22:58,446 --> 01:23:00,946
You took everything!

683
01:23:09,179 --> 01:23:12,546
Pass through it.
- You saw him? -Yes.

684
01:23:26,913 --> 01:23:27,946
Who's there?

685
01:23:29,779 --> 01:23:33,179
You were there. There
you, among the deceased.

686
01:23:34,513 --> 01:23:38,446
= Not afraid of the rifle. Something else.

687
01:23:47,446 --> 01:23:52,213
You held it. And restored?
-That's my memory.

688
01:23:52,713 --> 01:23:56,413
Death instruments have a strong
connection with a life-threatening life.

689
01:23:58,279 --> 01:24:00,213
What he was supposed to kill

690
01:24:00,846 --> 01:24:02,479
saved him.

691
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:15,213
Ben, help you
get rid of suffering.

692
01:24:22,246 --> 01:24:23,813
I am the mother.

693
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:30,879
Borac.

694
01:24:34,379 --> 01:24:35,813
Show me!

695
01:24:38,446 --> 01:24:40,013
Protector.

696
01:24:41,779 --> 01:24:44,279
I'm not scared.

697
01:25:39,779 --> 01:25:41,713
See the truth.

698
01:26:05,913 --> 01:26:07,213
Yes.

699
01:26:15,579 --> 01:26:17,413
Now he found peace.

700
01:26:18,179 --> 01:26:19,679
Joined the brothers.

701
01:26:20,979 --> 01:26:23,513
You did it. They went.

702
01:26:28,946 --> 01:26:32,013
Everyone else, go back to the rooms.

703
01:26:34,679 --> 01:26:36,046
= All of you.

704
01:27:02,313 --> 01:27:03,579
= Look!

705
01:27:04,646 --> 01:27:08,446

Ruby loves you. It did not

You know that, do not you?

Re-build, of course.
