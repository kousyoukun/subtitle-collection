1
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,040
Henry?

2
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,950
Henry.

3
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,920
Henry.

4
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,870
Henry?

5
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,910
Darling, what is it?

6
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,910
What are you doing?

7
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,010
He's coming for us.

8
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,020
I couldn't move.

9
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,620
I started shaking. I was getting dizzy.

10
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,130
I was sure everyone in the room wanted to kill me.

11
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,170
I've never been so scared.

12
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,950
Pointless in the end though, fear, isn't it?

13
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,630
That's your best advice, doc?

14
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,630
All right.

15
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,040
What do you think controls you?

16
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,310
Your body or your mind?

17
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,310
Your money controls me, sugar.

18
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,350
Ah, there you go.

19
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,920
-Fine. -Okay, okay.

20
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,090
I think my body and mind control each other.

21
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,160
Well, let's find out.

22
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,090
Is this real?

23
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,290
Yes.

24
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,890
-Yes? -Yes.

25
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,100
The mind

26
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,260
is incredibly creative.

27
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,270
It can make us see situations

28
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,610
that appear completely real,

29
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,870
but are in fact

30
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,110
nothing more than illusions,

31
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,880
perceptions of truth.

32
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,090
How did you do that?

33
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,860
Sometimes we all need a little help

34
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,160
to see the difference between reality and illusion.

35
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,860
And that's about taking control,

36
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,970
about not letting fear control you.

37
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:54,370
Because fear in the end only exists in your mind.

38
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,720
All right. Sorry to say good night.

39
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,020
I'm looking for Dr. Price.

40
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,790
-Good night. -I'm Arthur Gates,

41
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,160
Chief Legal Officer of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company.

42
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,230
Really?

43
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,000
See you next week, sugar.

44
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,630
You're a hard man to reach, Dr. Price.

45
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,100
Good night, Nancy.

46
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,370
-Good night. -Good night.

47
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,370
I'm on sabbatical.

48
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,040
Good night.

49
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,380
What do you want? A prescription?

50
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,720
I've come to offer you employment.

51
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,720
-Whiskey? -No, thank you.

52
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,950
Are you familiar with Sarah Winchester, Dr. Price?

53
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,460
Mrs. Winchester's husband William

54
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,990
was the majority shareholder

55
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,390
of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company.

56
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,230
Twenty-five years ago, William passed,

57
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,200
leaving Mrs. Winchester a rather large inheritance,

58
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,770
and 51% of the company.

59
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:01,410
Mrs. Winchester also lost her only child, Annie.

60
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,980
It's said in her grief,

61
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,350
she turned to a medium... Spiritualist of some sort.

62
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,180
The medium may have taken advantage of her mental state.

63
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,820
That's not uncommon after a tragedy.

64
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,990
I can assure you,

65
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,730
Sarah Winchester is anything but common.

66
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,390
Aye, after her spiritual encounter,

67
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,030
she moved across the country to San Jose,

68
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,800
-where she purchased what... -Where's my...

69
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,200
Was then an eight-room house.

70
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,170
Maybe it's in the garden room.

71
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,940
She spent the last 20 years expanding it.

72
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,540
What stands now is

73
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,180
a gargantuan seven storied structure,

74
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,250
with no apparent rhyme or reason,

75
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,310
no master plan,

76
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,420
each maze of halls more confusing than the next.

77
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,090
A house under never-ending construction,

78
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,790
built on the orders of a grieving widow

79
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,430
whose mind is as chaotic as the house itself.

80
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,900
Over the years, she's become more and more reclusive.

81
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,170
Last month, the Board of Directors

82
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,570
enacted its right to assess

83
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,940
Mrs. Winchester's state of mind,

84
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,980
to determine if she's fit to control the company.

85
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,380
You want to take it away from her?

86
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,520
We're worried about her sanity, Dr. Price.

87
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,090
We need a professional.

88
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,920
Any kind of diagnosis

89
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,560
from such a long distance would be impossible.

90
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,460
Well, Mrs. Winchester's agreed

91
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,360
to let you stay at the residence.

92
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,130
An offer that is exceedingly rare.

93
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,470
An unwilling patient, the long distance.

94
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,570
This is not something ordinarily I...

95
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,840
Name the amount.

96
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,970
Doesn't really work like that.

97
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,080
How much do you owe?

98
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,150
Mortgage?

99
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,880
Hospital expenses?

100
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,450
Medicine?

101
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,890
Three hundred.

102
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,220
We'll pay six.

103
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,920
For the appropriate assessment.

104
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,140
Mrs. Winchester requests the bay window frame

105
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,980
be installed by sundown.

106
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,110
Move with haste.

107
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,520
Let me get that, sir.

108
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,990
Thank you.

109
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,060
Busy day of construction here, sir.

110
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,130
-Yes. -Days and nights

111
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,370
are always busy here.

112
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,430
Really? Nights, too?

113
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,400
Right round the clock, sir.

114
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,270
This way.

115
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,610
Most of the rooms don't stay up very long,

116
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,550
like Mrs. Winchester's garden room there.

117
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,950
That might not last the season.

118
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,120
Really?

119
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,650
Check the measurements here have been done.

120
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,020
Please wait in the library, sir.

121
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,560
I'll call for Mrs. Marriott.

122
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,050
-Jesus! -My apologies, sir.

123
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,180
The door was making a terrible racket.

124
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,350
No, no, no, no, no.

125
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,320
That's quite all right.

126
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,530
Gave me a fright.

127
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,230
Dr. Price?

128
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,530
-Yes. -Welcome.

129
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,800
Marion Marriott, Mrs. Winchester's niece.

130
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,540
Oh. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

131
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,180
I must say, I have never quite seen a house like this.

132
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,350
My aunt advised me of the nature of your visit.

133
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,150
As you are aware, it is unfortunate timing,

134
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,480
so I would ask you to behave in a manner

135
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,250
befitting the circumstance.

136
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,790
Unfortunate, how?

137
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,090
A tragedy occurred.

138
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,660
Oh.

139
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,160
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

140
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,760
Are you carrying firearms?

141
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,090
Should I be?

142
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,390
Aunt Sarah forbids them.

143
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Well.

144
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,670
I'm completely unarmed.

145
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,440
Good. You, like I, like everyone,

146
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,800
are guests in Aunt Sarah's home.

147
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,610
You will abide by her rules.

148
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,870
Understood.

149
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,110
You are to stay in this section of the house, the east wing.

150
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,210
Aunt Sarah's private domains are off limits.

151
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,220
Understood.

152
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,650
So...

153
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,580
Are you close to your aunt?

154
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,620
Is this already part of your evaluation, Dr. Price?

155
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,520
No, ma'am, it is not.

156
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,390
Yes.

157
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,860
Aunt Sarah is an exceptional woman.

158
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,230
She does not deserve to be treated

159
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,230
with anything less than complete respect.

160
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,630
Yes, ma'am. Quite right.

161
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,410
May I?

162
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,180
This is the grand ballroom,

163
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,210
built almost entirely without nails.

164
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,780
The walls and parquet floor are made of six separate hard woods.

165
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,350
The silver chandelier was imported from Germany.

166
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,390
Follow me, Doctor.

167
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,330
There are almost one hundred rooms in the house.

168
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,830
It's easy to get lost.

169
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,800
How unusual.

170
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,600
Aunt Sarah suffers from arthritis.

171
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,540
This makes climbing stairs manageable for her.

172
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,840
The house can be overwhelming. Do keep up.

173
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,880
What is this?

174
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,690
It's a communication device.

175
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,920
Really?

176
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,950
You speak into the holes, and a series of pipes

177
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,890
travel the sound to the desired room.

178
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,360
-Ingenious. -Yes.

179
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,230
You'll find many of my aunt's inventions are state of the art.

180
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,840
I trust you'll find everything you need with the room.

181
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,670
Aunt Sarah will be joining us for dinner.

182
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,470
Perhaps you would like to freshen up beforehand.

183
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,480
I very much look forward to meeting your aunt.

184
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,750
Aunt Sarah would not approve of you

185
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,750
drinking before dinner hour.

186
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,720
Her sense of smell is still as acute as mine.

187
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,620
Respect her wishes.

188
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,270
You were right about me, Ruby.

189
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,680
I am

190
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,810
a fraud.

191
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,900
You're a phony, hmm?

192
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,940
That feels good.

193
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,340
Well, you don't know what you're doing.

194
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,680
You don't know what you're doing.

195
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,920
Oh, yeah. You prove nothing.

196
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,630
For Christ's sake.

197
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,300
Jesus Christ!

198
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,470
Ah!

199
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,110
Who are you? What do you want?

200
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,380
Dinner will be served in 10 minutes.

201
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,050
-You're alone, yes? -Yes, sir.

202
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,950
-Nobody else with you? -No, sir.

203
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,490
No? You didn't see anyone just come out of here?

204
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,630
Are you all right, sir?

205
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,460
I'm fine. I just thought someone else was...

206
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,400
Well, I thought I saw someone else in my room.

207
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,500
Interesting.

208
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,000
Look, I'm fine, yes.

209
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,670
Dinner in 10 minutes, yes?

210
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,710
-Sir. -Good, thank you.

211
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,690
Take it nice and easy.

212
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,090
There.

213
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,670
Henry.

214
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,610
Stop it.

215
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,090
Henry, stop that!

216
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,760
Henry. Henry! Just...

217
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,160
Henry, you must be very excited

218
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,730
to spend some time in your great aunt's house.

219
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,470
We're here because Father died.

220
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,710
Well, I am very sorry for your loss, young man.

221
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,910
-I'm not. -Henry!

222
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:47,510
It's my fault. I didn't mean to pry.

223
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,750
Of course, you did. That's why you're here.

224
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,450
Yes. Suppose so.

225
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,590
I recently lost someone myself.

226
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,590
So if you feel like discussing anything,

227
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,830
I might be able to provide some assistance

228
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,400
to yourself or young Henry here.

229
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,230
I imagine you must be very good at your job

230
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,900
if Aunt Sarah chose you to be her assessor.

231
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,570
I had no idea she chose me herself.

232
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,580
I'm just hoping I can help.

233
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,080
If you want to help, Doctor,

234
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,680
you can give my aunt a clean bill of health

235
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,780
and be on your way.

236
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,620
Well, I have a duty to my profession

237
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,750
and an obligation to my employers.

238
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,120
Aunt Sarah is your employer.

239
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,090
It is still half her company.

240
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,910
-Madam. -Good evening, Madam.

241
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,080
Good evening, Madam.

242
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,180
Dr. Price.

243
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,950
Mrs. Winchester, it's a pleasure to finally meet you.

244
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,320
The pleasure is due to the lawyers

245
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,090
of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company.

246
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,190
Yes.

247
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,900
I suppose you're right.

248
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,770
I hope everything has been to your satisfaction so far?

249
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,900
I cannot fault the hospitality.

250
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,070
It's quite a special house, is it not?

251
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,580
Now that, ma'am, is a fact beyond dispute.

252
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,150
Thank you.

253
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,250
I understand the Winchester is still considered

254
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,920
the superior rifle on the market, ma'am.

255
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,190
Superior?

256
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,290
Superior at what?

257
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,600
Accuracy, range, stopping power.

258
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,030
Killing.

259
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,930
Indiscriminate killing.

260
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,930
Very superior.

261
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:27,040
You feel responsible for the misuse of your product?

262
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,840
If a weapon works as intended,

263
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,040
one can hardly call it a misuse.

264
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,210
Well, it can be used for good or bad,

265
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,120
depending on the person wielding it.

266
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,280
Yes.

267
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:44,290
Then again, perhaps roller skates are a less dangerous endeavor.

268
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,820
The company is expanding,

269
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,890
looking for other opportunities.

270
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,230
I understand that was at your behest, Mrs. Winchester?

271
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,300
It was.

272
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,260
To the displeasure of the board.

273
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,870
It appears that strapping wheels to one's feet

274
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,170
can also be a perilous endeavor.

275
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,840
Hear, hear.

276
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,660
Tell me the story about the farmer

277
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,830
-who owned the old mule. -No.

278
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,100
I always liked that story.

279
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,700
A delusional disorder.

280
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,170
-Yes. -That's what you called it.

281
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,440
Yes.

282
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,980
I don't want to talk anymore.

283
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,110
I need you to believe me.

284
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:44,210
I want to be with you, Ruby. Together forever.

285
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,150
Hello?

286
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,060
Hello?

287
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,920
Christ!

288
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,320
You've poisoned your mind, Eric.

289
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,430
You've poisoned your mind.

290
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,260
I need some air.

291
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,580
Deja vu.

292
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,710
Hey!

293
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,340
Hey!

294
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,650
Move, hey! Move! Move!

295
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,760
I see you.

296
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,670
Oh, Henry! Darling!

297
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,470
What's happening to you, sweetheart?

298
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,040
Thank you.

299
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,750
Darling, what's happening to you?

300
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,320
Mrs. Winchester,

301
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,260
I really must have your full attention.

302
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,760
Oh, you have it, Dr. Price.

303
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,760
Yes, but perhaps you would be more comfortable if...

304
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,530
Last night was quite a traumatic event.

305
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,830
I'm grateful for your actions.

306
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,870
I fear you may have me at a...

307
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,370
An emotional disadvantage today.

308
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,170
Yes, I understand.

309
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,370
I don't mean to pry, but has Master Henry

310
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,280
been prone to sleepwalking in the past?

311
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,310
No.

312
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,750
But you may know, he did witness

313
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,220
the death of his father.

314
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,690
Yes.

315
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,390
Well, this is the first

316
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,520
in a series of sessions I wish to conduct.

317
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,330
And I can assure you that today will be quite benign.

318
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,600
No, no, no. Let's just get straight to it, Doctor.

319
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,230
You are here to assess my erratic behavior,

320
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,170
are you not?

321
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,900
Well, erratic behavior is not the phrase

322
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,400
that I would've chosen, but...

323
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,670
-Now, I'll speak with you truthfully. -Please.

324
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,840
But you will do me the same courtesy.

325
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,310
Of course.

326
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,310
Do you suffer from soldier's syndrome?

327
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,180
I'm sorry?

328
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:04,510
Are you an abuser of medication?

329
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,750
Mrs. Winchester, I think it's best if I ask the questions.

330
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,890
Your wife, did she believe you are a good therapist?

331
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,490
We're not here to discuss my wife.

332
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,190
Your wife Ruby?

333
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,330
No, we are not.

334
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,430
And I would appreciate your honesty.

335
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,800
Are you an abuser of medication?

336
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,300
No, I'm not.

337
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,810
-So... -I will share a fact with you,

338
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,410
which you may find questionable.

339
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,680
But I assure you, it is a fact.

340
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,680
Please.

341
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,820
I am cursed.

342
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,950
Cursed, how?

343
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,550
Have you read my papers?

344
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,320
-Of course, I have. -And what did they say?

345
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,450
Well, among many things,

346
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,820
they say that this is the house that spirits built.

347
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:50,330
See, profiting from such a thing as violence and death,

348
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,670
that is a wickedness that follows you like a shadow.

349
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,840
Yes, we might also call those shadows "guilt."

350
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,540
But tell me, how do these shadows follow you?

351
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,910
I may be getting old, Dr. Price,

352
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:06,310
but I assure you, I have not lost my senses.

353
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:10,220
I know the difference between illusion and reality.

354
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,280
I see.

355
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:18,490
Your mind rules your body.

356
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,660
The mind can be incredibly creative.

357
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,660
But it can also, at times, fail us.

358
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,900
My mind has never failed me.

359
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,600
What we see, taste, and touch

360
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,640
are interpreted and processed to give us our truth.

361
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,710
And that truth can in turn be an illusion,

362
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:41,680
created, distorted, by grief.

363
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,920
Do you believe in ghosts, Dr. Price?

364
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:50,450
No, ma'am. Why would I?

365
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:53,590
Offering my staff that bill would be greatly appreciated.

366
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,360
Even the nickel inside the bill

367
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,560
would be a respectable start.

368
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,700
Really! Silly illusions?

369
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,330
Do you take me for a fool?

370
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,640
No, ma'am. I do not.

371
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,070
No more diversions from reality.

372
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,810
No more parlor tricks.

373
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:09,910
And your medication will have to be confiscated.

374
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,610
Mrs. Winchester, I'm sorry, but I must insist, I'm not a child...

375
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,680
-This is my home, Dr. Price. -And I will not be...

376
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,580
You will obey my rules.

377
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,980
If you want me to open up this house for you,

378
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,620
you need clarity.

379
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,290
Do you have another question for me?

380
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,460
Yes, ma'am.

381
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:38,070
Is it really necessary to confine me to quarters?

382
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,670
That is Madam's wish, sir.

383
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,810
Hmm.

384
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,610
And the condition of Master Henry?

385
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:47,410
He too is confined to quarters.

386
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,850
And Mrs. Marriott has not left his side.

387
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,680
Damn it!

388
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,890
"Sir, the members of the board eagerly await your evaluation.

389
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,930
"I trust you will make an accurate assessment.

390
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,430
"Regards, Arthur C. Gates, Chief Legal Officer."

391
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,810
Sarah Winchester's psychological assessment

392
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,110
and mental status examination.

393
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,550
Dr. Eric A. Price, April 16, 1906.

394
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,950
Appearance, normal.

395
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,990
Hygiene, physical characteristics, all normal.

396
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:11,460
Patient struggles with the loss of her husband and child.

397
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,860
Her behavior is at times slightly aggressive.

398
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,530
Perception, visual hallucinations

399
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,970
that patient often refers to as shadows or ghosts.

400
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,910
I feel them, their presence.

401
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:33,850
Go on.

402
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,490
I feel their presence, their energy.

403
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:46,500
Their unfinished business has brought them here.

404
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,460
Do you perhaps in any way blame them

405
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:51,000
for the death of your husband and child?

406
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,540
I will mourn William and dear Annie always.

407
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,180
I love all my family very much, Dr. Price.

408
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,980
They are the true riches of my life,

409
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,550
and I will do whatever it takes to protect them.

410
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,860
Can you tell me why the...

411
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,840
Why those bells chime at midnight?

412
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,900
It's midnight, sir.

413
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,200
Well, yes.

414
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,780
But is there any significance to it?

415
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,550
It's midnight, sir.

416
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:35,950
Thank you.

417
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:02,090
I swear, the laudanum is still in my system.

418
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:06,390
Let's just hope it's withdrawals.

419
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:10,200
It always was withdrawals. It had to be. Had to be.

420
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:17,000
I have a question for you, Dr. Price.

421
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,770
Again, Mrs. Winchester, it's best if I ask...

422
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,370
What is it like to die?

423
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:21,340
Talking about your...

424
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:24,010
Deceased for three minutes, were you not?

425
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:32,050
You know, I keep records

426
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:35,250
of all the lives a Winchester has taken.

427
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,990
Hundreds have been reported. Probably thousands haven't.

428
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,790
The guilty, the innocent...

429
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,930
The rifle doesn't discriminate.

430
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:48,300
And many of the souls make their way to this house.

431
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,430
That's impressive.

432
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,200
As you can clearly see, I am still here.

433
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,370
So perhaps you could do me

434
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:56,810
the kindness of taking me off that shelf.

435
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,840
You were shot.

436
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,150
I was.

437
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,320
This.

438
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,790
And it did kill me.

439
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,770
You kept it and refurbished it.

440
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,900
-I did. -Why?

441
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,940
Well, because it's a reminder of my past.

442
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,170
Because it's my connection to death

443
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,840
and to all that I've lost.

444
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,280
Instruments of death

445
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,810
have a powerful connection to the afterlife.

446
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,220
We hold on to mementos to help us heal.

447
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,090
But sometimes, they do more harm than good.

448
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,860
Precisely.

449
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,330
So tell me, what do you think it is you're holding on to?

450
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:56,070
Have you ever been to a spiritualist?

451
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,870
But I understand you have.

452
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:01,040
You know, it is believed

453
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,940
that once we've departed this world,

454
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,840
we can see others

455
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,280
who have left their physical selves behind.

456
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,210
Is that right?

457
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,980
Have you ever experienced such a thing?

458
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,920
I can't say that I have, no.

459
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:16,550
Is it painful to die?

460
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:17,590
Mrs. Winchester,

461
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:19,590
we really must continue with this evaluation.

462
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:22,160
Please, Doctor. Please.

463
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,530
Yes.

464
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:27,970
And then nothing.

465
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:31,300
Just a calmness.

466
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:36,040
And when I came back, it was painful again.

467
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:39,340
If that makes sense.

468
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,880
Yes.

469
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,420
Yes, because you too have experienced great pain.

470
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:52,250
Grief can be far more crippling

471
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,890
than arthritis, Doctor.

472
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:56,660
Mrs. Winchester, do you blame the shadows

473
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,200
for the loss of your husband and child?

474
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:03,430
Were you out of your room last night?

475
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,880
Yes, I was.

476
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,110
Thank you.

477
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:14,510
Thank you for telling me the truth.

478
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,420
So, why all the noise? Why all this construction?

479
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:32,090
They want me to build, Doctor.

480
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,970
The spirits killed by the rifle,

481
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:37,930
they guide me.

482
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,440
Guide you in drawing building plans?

483
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,570
Yes.

484
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:44,680
For what? Why?

485
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,710
For the rooms, of course.

486
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:49,050
You see, once their rooms are completed,

487
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:51,050
their presence grows stronger.

488
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:54,320
Hence, the house that spirits built?

489
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:55,650
Yes.

490
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:58,550
The shadows that follow me,

491
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,090
they have unfinished business.

492
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:03,930
You saw what I did last night, didn't you?

493
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,500
I did.

494
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,470
At the chime of midnight, they clamor.

495
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:13,640
The bells summon them.

496
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:18,610
They communicate through plans, drawings.

497
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:22,480
They want me to reconstruct the rooms that they died in,

498
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,050
then they can enter our world.

499
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:27,480
And the trouble is, I don't always know

500
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,120
who it is I'm speaking with.

501
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,660
It could be some innocent bystander

502
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:35,660
or a victim of a crime,

503
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:40,200
or someone else.

504
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,700
Who else, Mrs. Winchester?

505
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:46,370
Last night, a spirit more powerful

506
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:50,580
than any I've encountered endangered my family.

507
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,080
Who are you?

508
00:45:55,750 --> 00:46:00,520
Doctor, who do you see in this room at this moment?

509
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:02,620
Just you.

510
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,490
Only me?

511
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,570
Just you.

512
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,770
It will take time.

513
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:21,670
You still need to clear your head.

514
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,490
Oh, sir!

515
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:44,490
I would like to check in

516
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,100
on Mrs. Marriott and Master Henry, if I may.

517
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,070
I will inquire, sir.

518
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:51,200
Perhaps, may I ask you a question?

519
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:53,440
A question, sir?

520
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,310
Yes. I mean, tell me, have you ever seen any...

521
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,510
Any ghosts?

522
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:00,380
No, sir.

523
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,680
But you have heard the rumors, the stories?

524
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,220
I have heard tall tales.

525
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:11,220
Some taller than others.

526
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,760
Have you ever witnessed anything out of the ordinary?

527
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:24,570
So display cabinets along the walls,

528
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:26,710
and then a line of them down the middle of the room.

529
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:28,940
Yes, ma'am.

530
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:32,440
And what type of Winchester would you like delivered?

531
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:37,310
Every type, every model.

532
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,820
Okay, let's go back.

533
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:45,150
Tell me please what happens once these rooms are finished?

534
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,220
Well, the spirit's presence grows

535
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,230
more powerful and more...

536
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:50,860
More focused.

537
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,560
Their voices get stronger.

538
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,860
And we converse.

539
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,730
Converse how? About what?

540
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,700
I show them my deep remorse.

541
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:04,370
I want to help them let go of their grief and their anger.

542
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:05,680
And how do they react?

543
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,180
Favorably. Yes, mostly.

544
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,480
Once they are at peace, then they can move on.

545
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,220
We can tear down their room, and then we start again.

546
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:18,160
And are there those that don't react so favorably?

547
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:21,390
Yes.

548
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:23,790
Yes, we lock them away.

549
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,830
How does one lock a spirit away?

550
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:28,670
Thirteen nails seals them in.

551
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:30,900
Once they find peace, we can release them,

552
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,800
and they can leave this house.

553
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,370
So 13 is

554
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,370
a devilish number to protect you from devils?

555
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:39,240
No, no, no. That is a divine number,

556
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,810
to protect the cycle of life and death.

557
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:43,680
And does this divine number always work?

558
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,120
I mean, what if a spirit simply doesn't want to be locked away?

559
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,720
The unmendable souls

560
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,320
prey upon the innocent and the pure.

561
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:58,130
And by the innocent and pure, you mean Master Henry?

562
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,900
We can stand between them.

563
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:05,540
I and you.

564
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,270
With your assistance,

565
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:11,180
I can help this spirit find peace.

566
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:18,880
You don't believe any of this. I understand.

567
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,620
Ma'am, I do not.

568
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:25,720
I do not believe in anything I cannot see or study.

569
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,960
Mrs. Winchester, you have built this house,

570
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,930
this place, this reality.

571
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:32,330
Therefore, you can control it, can you not?

572
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:34,930
Yes, perhaps.

573
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,400
We all have the ability

574
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,570
to create and control our own reality.

575
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:41,970
But for some, for you, Mrs. Winchester, for you,

576
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:43,810
that will mean letting go of the past.

577
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,550
Make your assessment, Doctor.

578
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:53,750
Say what you feel is the truth about Sarah Winchester.

579
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:56,220
And if that means you lose control of your company?

580
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,390
There are worse things in this world to lose than that, Doctor.

581
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:09,970
I see you've finished the new room.

582
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,040
Of course.

583
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,770
Must be very profitable for you,

584
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:18,570
all this working round the clock.

585
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,310
We all appreciate

586
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:23,310
Mrs. Winchester's ongoing employment

587
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:24,920
and her creativity.

588
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:27,320
I must say, that creativity

589
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,820
certainly leads to some rather odd designs.

590
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:33,320
Do you think it possible a woman of advancing years

591
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,990
may be susceptible to flights of fancy?

592
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:38,660
No, sir. I do not.

593
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:44,830
Could I see inside the garden room, please?

594
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,670
I had one similar, and I would be much obliged if...

595
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:48,870
No, sir. That room is sealed.

596
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,010
Therefore, it's off limits.

597
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:54,710
Good day, Doctor.

598
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,590
Well, Eric, that's going really well.

599
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:17,770
How is he?

600
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:20,970
Fine. Resting.

601
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:23,910
Has he ever been prone to behavior like that in the past?

602
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:25,810
No.

603
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:26,880
Never?

604
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:33,620
She told you, didn't she, about the Winchester curse?

605
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,620
Yes.

606
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:38,390
Do you believe her, or do you think she's crazy?

607
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:41,720
I think crazy is a dangerous word.

608
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:43,890
People have certain medical conditions

609
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,530
and with the right diagnosis and treatment,

610
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:47,930
they can be helped.

611
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:54,810
I do not believe in curses, Doctor.

612
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,870
Good. Nor do I.

613
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,810
I think perhaps your son's behavior

614
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:02,480
has been triggered by the sudden death of his father.

615
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,810
Yes.

616
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:07,350
Could you tell me how your husband died?

617
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:10,090
He had demons,

618
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:14,060
but not the kind that my aunt believes haunt her.

619
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,800
Go on.

620
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,830
Aunt Sarah's husband died suddenly of tuberculosis.

621
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:25,040
And then she lost poor Annie.

622
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:29,070
She believes our family curse is spreading.

623
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:42,020
My husband loved the drink

624
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,520
more than his wife and child.

625
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,460
I believe that was his curse.

626
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:52,660
Now he is gone, and I'm alone,

627
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,730
better off in so many ways without him.

628
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,000
But it terrifies me.

629
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,470
Don't let that fear control you.

630
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:03,880
Fear only exists in your mind.

631
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:07,010
When we fear the most,

632
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:09,950
we must take control.

633
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:12,680
You can be a fighter. You can be a protector.

634
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,750
I do not feel like a protector.

635
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:17,590
Aunt Sarah is the fighter.

636
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,090
-Yes. -She would die to save us.

637
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,530
Perhaps.

638
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:26,460
Have you ever loved someone so much you would die to save them?

639
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,670
I have.

640
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:36,570
I also knew someone who was haunted by demons, voices.

641
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:39,540
And did the time ever come when you had to protect them?

642
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:41,710
It did.

643
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:44,880
What did you do?

644
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:47,950
I died.

645
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:14,810
Henry!

646
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,880
Ahh!

647
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:21,920
Henry.

648
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,590
Henry!

649
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,040
Henry.

650
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,810
Henry! It's me!

651
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:10,900
No.

652
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,210
Ah!

653
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:20,880
Henry! Henry!

654
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:25,580
-Henry! Henry! -Stop it! Stop!

655
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,280
Stop, Henry, stop!

656
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,290
-Who are you? -Die!

657
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:42,000
Mother?

658
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,970
Oh, Henry.

659
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:47,740
Henry. Henry.

660
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,080
I'm so sorry, Aunt Sarah.

661
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,750
I've let you down, and I've let Henry down.

662
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:01,120
No, no.

663
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:04,290
This spirit has a power we've not seen before.

664
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:05,990
Oh, my God.

665
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,730
It can take over a mind.

666
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,360
John, send everyone home.

667
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,330
Only we in this room must remain.

668
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,430
Yes, ma'am.

669
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:19,130
This child must be taken to a hospital immediately.

670
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,800
No, no. We must watch over him.

671
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,940
To a hospital immediately.

672
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:23,670
No. No one else will understand.

673
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:25,070
-He must stay here. -This is insanity.

674
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,210
We will watch over him.

675
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:28,010
Dr. Price may be right.

676
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,850
No. No. We will protect him.

677
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:32,350
We will protect him at all costs.

678
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:33,650
John, come with me.

679
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:34,850
Aunt Sarah!

680
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:39,720
Ma'am, I insist that you receive medical treatment.

681
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,790
Seal that door. Thirteen nails.

682
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:43,900
Now.

683
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:45,660
Now!

684
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:47,830
Yes, ma'am.

685
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,840
You leave my family alone.

686
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,410
You speak with me.

687
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:08,320
Let's just think this through.

688
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,250
Please, Mrs. Marriott, be rational.

689
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:12,920
Henry clearly has a trauma and needs help.

690
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,320
Your aunt is caught in a superstition.

691
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,860
We need...

692
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:06,070
Thirteen hooks.

693
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,980
You must listen to me.

694
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,510
Is the rifle room finished?

695
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:10,880
Yes, ma'am.

696
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,520
My God. This presence is so strong.

697
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,080
Oh, I feel its hatred...

698
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:16,220
Oh, enough with the games!

699
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:18,150
We're taking this boy to a hospital.

700
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,960
-We should listen to him. -Yes!

701
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,220
The boy tried to kill you.

702
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:23,760
No. The shadows will follow us.

703
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,060
Wherever we go.

704
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:27,460
No, Henry will not suffer the same fate

705
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:29,000
-as my darling Annie... -Henry's condition

706
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,230
cannot be cured by witchcraft.

707
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:31,400
The boy needs a doctor.

708
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,000
Conditions can be cured, Doctor.

709
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,400
Curses cannot.

710
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:37,210
Mrs. Marriott, will you please listen to me?

711
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:38,370
-Marion... -I'm...

712
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:39,940
I'm going with Dr. Price.

713
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:41,880
-No. Henry must stay. -I'll make the arrangements.

714
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,310
-Gentlemen, you'll excuse me. -No! No!

715
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:45,310
Marion, please! Henry must stay.

716
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:46,820
He must stay with us.

717
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,250
Aunt Sarah, I must think of Henry.

718
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:50,120
I should go with him.

719
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,460
I will prove it to you.

720
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,290
Yes, I... I will.

721
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:57,290
This way.

722
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,340
Operator.

723
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:20,020
Winchester Repeating Arms Company.

724
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:21,380
This is Arthur Gates.

725
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:24,850
Mr. Gates, it's Dr. Eric Price here.

726
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,520
I trust the assessment is going well, Doctor.

727
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,830
I understand you received our letter.

728
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:31,230
It's fine, Mr. Gates.

729
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:34,560
But I require immediate transportation to the nearest hospital.

730
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:35,930
Is everything all right?

731
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:38,870
Everything is fine. Just please, a driver, as soon as possible.

732
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:41,200
-Of course, right away. -Thank you.

733
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,070
And the assessment, Doctor?

734
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:44,410
You'll get what you wanted.

735
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,080
Christ!

736
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,180
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.

737
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:57,990
Sir, we're all deeply concerned for Master Henry's well-being.

738
00:59:57,990 --> 01:00:00,250
If the anything I can do to assist you, I...

739
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,360
Well...

740
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:04,060
Actually, you can.

741
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:06,130
I need to get my bags, please.

742
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:08,160
-Of course. -Thank you.

743
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:09,470
Happy to help.

744
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:17,640
Mrs. Winchester is truly a remarkable woman.

745
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,510
She knows what she's doing.

746
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:21,080
She has created a vessel

747
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,650
for the deceased to communicate with her.

748
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:24,580
She's certainly created some architectural oddities.

749
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:27,890
This house, I've seen things.

750
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,120
I know this room.

751
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:34,390
Things?

752
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:37,030
The dead.

753
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:40,260
Criminals.

754
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:42,330
Lost souls who met a violent end.

755
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:49,370
You've seen them, haven't you?

756
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:59,650
Dr. Price, many staff have reported hearing noises.

757
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:02,520
They come from inside rooms that have been nailed shut.

758
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,450
Strange occurrences in those rooms...

759
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:06,120
That is why the doors have been sealed,

760
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,460
to keep the unruly in.

761
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,990
But the staff have only heard noises.

762
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:13,460
To see them, well,

763
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:15,370
I believe you and I are unique.

764
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:18,200
Really?

765
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,000
Yes, perhaps it's all just a symptom

766
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,610
of Mrs. Winchester's persuasive influence.

767
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:25,510
Sir, locking Mrs. Marriott and her child away

768
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:28,210
is only delaying the inevitable.

769
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:30,180
And what is the inevitable?

770
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:31,580
They're all Winchester.

771
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:33,280
They will all die.

772
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:03,280
Mr. Hansen. Is she in there?

773
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,480
-Yes, Doctor. -Good. You need to hear this.

774
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,580
Mrs. Winchester, there is a man in your employ

775
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,550
who has clearly lost his mind. He just...

776
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:12,690
That's him.

777
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:15,220
You saw him? You spoke with him?

778
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:16,730
Well, yes, I spoke with him just now.

779
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:18,160
The man threatened you.

780
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,100
Read it. Read the paper.

781
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:26,230
"Corporal Benjamin Joseph Block was killed during a siege

782
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,140
"at the Winchester Repeating Arms general office."

783
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,300
That's impossible.

784
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:31,710
This newspaper is 20 years old.

785
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:35,610
Cruelty, grief, and loss

786
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:38,380
can make people do unimaginable things.

787
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:45,120
Ben lost two brothers on the battlefield.

788
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,120
The youngest was only 14 years old.

789
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:50,490
Their Confederate muskets were no match

790
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:53,300
for the Winchester rifles of the Union Army.

791
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,400
They were cut down.

792
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,040
Ben swore revenge.

793
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,140
To him, the people who created the weapon

794
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,780
that killed his brothers were as guilty

795
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:11,620
as those who pulled the trigger.

796
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:24,530
He killed 15 innocent people that day.

797
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,560
He locked himself in the display room.

798
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,770
We used to call it the show-off room.

799
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,170
We know you're in there.

800
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:34,800
We have the building surrounded.

801
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:37,540
# Beautiful dreamer

802
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:39,610
# Wake unto me

803
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:47,550
# Starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee

804
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:49,550
"Officer John Mandel told the press,

805
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:50,750
"'I'm extremely proud of my team,

806
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,290
"'and that scum like Block

807
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:54,090
"'can't escape my men and their Winchesters.'"

808
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:55,290
Weapons ready!

809
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:18,810
This way. When the bell chimes at midnight,

810
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:21,680
he'll be at his most powerful.

811
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:25,620
Do you know who the most terrifying monster is, Doctor?

812
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:26,720
No.

813
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:31,460
The one you invite into your own home.

814
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:44,410
This is it.

815
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,750
This is the room.

816
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:11,270
This is an exact replica of the room he was killed in.

817
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,400
Yes.

818
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,810
And now that it is complete, he is in this world.

819
01:05:17,670 --> 01:05:20,110
Do you see anyone, Doctor?

820
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,550
It's impossible.

821
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:24,650
Doctor, you must believe.

822
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,620
It's illogical.

823
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,630
Corporal Block,

824
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,870
please,

825
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:45,930
please feel my deep remorse

826
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:47,300
for the death of your brothers,

827
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:52,270
of James and young Harry

828
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:54,580
by the Winchester rifle.

829
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:57,880
I know all three of you feel pain and torment.

830
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,850
But violence cannot bring justice.

831
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,320
Only more suffering,

832
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:08,190
and I will not allow my family to suffer anymore.

833
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:12,900
Leave this house with your brothers.

834
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:15,730
I hope together you can find peace.

835
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:28,310
# Beautiful dreamer

836
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:30,950
# Wake unto me

837
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:33,480
# Starlight and dewdrops

838
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,490
# Are waiting for thee

839
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:39,550
# Sounds of the rude world

840
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,820
# Heard in the day

841
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:46,430
# Led by the moonlight have all passed away

842
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:14,230
It's Ben.

843
01:08:07,110 --> 01:08:09,380
Stop them! Ah!

844
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:15,390
No!

845
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:27,760
Ah!

846
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:47,620
Mrs. Winchester?

847
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,690
I'll find another way to get to you!

848
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,670
Henry, sweetheart, where are you?

849
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,710
Henry? Henry?

850
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:22,950
Henry?

851
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,820
# Beautiful dreamer

852
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:26,090
Henry! Henry!

853
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:27,560
# Wake unto me

854
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:39,700
Eric, this is just in your mind.

855
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:41,000
Fear is just in your mind.

856
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,640
It is only in your mind.

857
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,450
Henry?

858
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:37,030
Henry, where are you?

859
01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:45,070
Henry, sweetheart?

860
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:48,100
Where are you?

861
01:11:10,890 --> 01:11:13,630
Be free, my brothers.

862
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:06,180
I always loved our garden room, sweetheart.

863
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:10,020
-Ruby. -But you let it die.

864
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:12,750
Oh, no.

865
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:15,120
Tell me the story about the farmer

866
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:16,830
who owned the old mule.

867
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:19,800
-No. -I always liked that story.

868
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,630
They built our garden room.

869
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:27,010
The farmer's old mule fell into his well.

870
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,710
Go on, Eric.

871
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:33,040
The farmer heard...

872
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:35,810
What?

873
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:37,180
He heard the mule crying.

874
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:40,780
And it broke his heart.

875
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:43,250
He chose to bury the animal in the well

876
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:45,220
-and put it out of its... -Its hardship.

877
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:49,720
He started shoveling.

878
01:12:49,730 --> 01:12:53,960
The mule realized that every time dirt fell on his back,

879
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:57,200
he could shake it off and step up.

880
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,970
Shovel after shovel.

881
01:12:58,970 --> 01:13:00,100
He could shake it off

882
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:02,100
-and he could step up... -Shake it off.

883
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:05,110
It wasn't long before the old mule,

884
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:07,840
battered and exhausted,

885
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:11,110
stepped over the wall of that well.

886
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:12,980
What should have buried him...

887
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:16,990
-Saved him. -And he overcame...

888
01:13:16,990 --> 01:13:18,420
This is not real.

889
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:20,320
This is not happening. You are not real.

890
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,260
I've tried to be a good wife.

891
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:24,290
The voices are not real, Ruby.

892
01:13:24,290 --> 01:13:25,690
They were never real.

893
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:27,060
They were just inside your head.

894
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:30,030
All these years, all I wanted was for you to believe me. But...

895
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:32,270
-I should have put you in care. -You never did.

896
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:33,830
I should have put you in care.

897
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,270
Just something that can be diagnosed and treated,

898
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:38,340
like any other crazy person.

899
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:41,370
Yes. Yes. I did. I made a mistake. I'm sorry.

900
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:43,980
A delusional disorder.

901
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:45,950
-Yes. -That's what you called it.

902
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:48,020
Yes. Put the gun down, Ruby, please.

903
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:49,350
We can talk about this.

904
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:51,790
I don't want to talk anymore.

905
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:53,820
I need you to believe me.

906
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:55,830
I don't know what I believe anymore.

907
01:13:57,330 --> 01:13:59,460
Someone like you never will.

908
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:01,130
Please, Ruby, don't.

909
01:14:01,130 --> 01:14:03,460
Please, I'm lost without you, Ruby.

910
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:05,770
I'm lost without you.

911
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:06,940
Don't do it. No!

912
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:39,300
You can go on.

913
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,910
You need to let go of your guilt,

914
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:45,880
so that I can let go of mine

915
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:49,280
and see the truth.

916
01:14:55,150 --> 01:14:57,120
I'm so sorry.

917
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:54,900
Mrs. Winchester, are you all right?

918
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:58,470
This spirit is destroying the balance of this house.

919
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:02,580
It has to be stopped.

920
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:11,890
Master Henry and Marion, we need to find them.

921
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:14,460
Seal that door.

922
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:18,030
Ben must not leave.

923
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,460
# Beautiful dreamer

924
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:25,500
Henry?

925
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:30,370
# Starlight and dewdrops

926
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:41,380
# Sounds of the rude world heard in the day

927
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:45,160
# Led by the moonlight have all passed away

928
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:10,440
Thirteen.

929
01:18:10,450 --> 01:18:11,520
Sit.

930
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,650
Sarah, I can see them.

931
01:18:18,450 --> 01:18:20,050
I can see all of them.

932
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:21,990
You're the only one who can.

933
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:24,290
You believe?

934
01:18:24,290 --> 01:18:27,200
I do. I do.

935
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:30,070
Dead for three minutes,

936
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:31,940
killed by the Winchester rifle.

937
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:35,040
You are connected to this house.

938
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:37,340
Yes.

939
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,650
Henry.

940
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:50,150
I'm not afraid.

941
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:58,530
I'm not afraid.

942
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:03,400
I won't let fear control me.

943
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:14,210
Henry!

944
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:16,580
Henry!

945
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:23,490
Oh, please, please come back to me!

946
01:19:31,530 --> 01:19:34,430
Marion and Henry are in grave danger.

947
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:39,970
The only way to save them is to stop Ben here and now.

948
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:43,810
Ben, leave my family alone.

949
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:49,410
You speak to me.

950
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:52,650
Talk to me.

951
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,220
Now.

952
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:08,500
Sarah.

953
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,540
Corporal Block is in this room.

954
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:20,270
The Winchesters are a vile plague!

955
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:22,580
This whore bitch has to die!

956
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:24,510
Sarah, fight him!

957
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:26,710
My brothers were killed by the rifle,

958
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,780
murdered by this instrument of death...

959
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:31,490
-Fight him! -That killed your wife.

960
01:20:36,490 --> 01:20:39,330
Sarah, control him!

961
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:40,560
Be present, Sarah. Be present.

962
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,630
I want you to suffer.

963
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:44,570
Marion is mine.

964
01:20:44,570 --> 01:20:46,230
Henry is mine!

965
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:47,470
No, no, no! Fight him!

966
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:50,210
And eye for an eye! Get off me!

967
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:52,670
These vermin profit from death.

968
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,710
-Sarah, fight him. -No more!

969
01:20:54,710 --> 01:20:56,180
No!

970
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:03,750
Seal the floor, Doctor.

971
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:05,690
Thirteen nails. Hurry!

972
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:09,290
His rage is endless.

973
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:12,190
But he can be stopped.

974
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:14,060
-How? -By something...

975
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:16,600
Something in this room.

976
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,500
He's afraid of something.

977
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,640
I felt it.

978
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:23,710
His gun.

979
01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:26,780
That's 12.

980
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,080
This is the gun

981
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:34,420
he used to kill.

982
01:21:40,490 --> 01:21:42,260
-Do you see him? -No.

983
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:45,930
There. Done.

984
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:47,530
Now he's locked in.

985
01:21:47,530 --> 01:21:48,670
And so are we.

986
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,680
Ben, show yourself.

987
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:05,350
Show yourself!

988
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:43,620
Your anger will never defeat us.

989
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:06,640
You took everything from me!

990
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:16,520
They're going right through him.

991
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,450
-You saw him? -Yes.

992
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:33,700
Who's there?

993
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:36,770
You're there.

994
01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:39,270
You are there amongst the dead.

995
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:41,910
It's not the gun.

996
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:44,550
He's afraid of something else.

997
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:55,860
You kept it and refurbished it.

998
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:57,590
All because it's a reminder of my past.

999
01:23:58,530 --> 01:23:59,860
Instruments of death

1000
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:02,530
have a powerful connection to the afterlife.

1001
01:24:04,030 --> 01:24:07,600
What should have killed him, saved him.

1002
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:21,520
Ben, we can help you be free of your torment.

1003
01:24:27,890 --> 01:24:29,290
I'm a mother...

1004
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:36,100
A fighter.

1005
01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:41,040
Show yourself.

1006
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:45,440
A protector.

1007
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:50,350
And I am not afraid.

1008
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,800
See the truth.

1009
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:12,900
Yes.

1010
01:26:21,470 --> 01:26:22,840
He's at peace.

1011
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,740
He has joined his brothers.

1012
01:26:26,710 --> 01:26:29,450
You've done it. They're gone.

1013
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:38,050
Everybody else, go back to your rooms.

1014
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:41,860
All of you.

1015
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:09,050
Henry.

1016
01:27:10,590 --> 01:27:11,990
Henry!

1017
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:14,490
Henry! Oh, Henry!

1018
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,900
Dear Mr. Gates,

1019
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:24,200
below you will find my psychological assessment

1020
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:26,130
and mental status examination

1021
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:29,170
of Mrs. Sarah Lockwood Winchester.

1022
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:32,240
It was conducted at her home between the dates of April 12

1023
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:35,180
to April 19, 1906,

1024
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:36,710
and prepared at the request

1025
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:39,080
of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company.

1026
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,050
In my professional opinion,

1027
01:27:41,050 --> 01:27:43,020
after having observed Mrs. Winchester

1028
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:44,180
for the past week,

1029
01:27:44,190 --> 01:27:47,990
it is my conclusion that she is of sound mind and body,

1030
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:49,990
and is fit to continue in her role

1031
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:52,760
with the Winchester Repeating Arms Company

1032
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:55,230
for as long as she desires such a burden.

1033
01:28:00,270 --> 01:28:03,170
Yours truly, Dr. Eric A. Price.

1034
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:23,590
It's time for us both to leave this house.

1035
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:28,030
I'll always miss you.

1036
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:47,650
Thank you, Dr. Price, for your help.

1037
01:28:47,650 --> 01:28:48,990
Young man.

1038
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,660
Thank you.

1039
01:29:07,770 --> 01:29:08,970
Time for me to say goodbye.

1040
01:29:18,610 --> 01:29:20,080
Ruby loves you.

1041
01:29:21,650 --> 01:29:23,850
That did not stop after her death.

1042
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:26,590
You know that, don't you?

1043
01:29:27,990 --> 01:29:29,090
I do.

1044
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,900
You know, in spite of everything,

1045
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:41,270
you really do have a beautiful home.

1046
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:42,870
What are you going to do next?

1047
01:29:44,210 --> 01:29:45,980
Rebuild, of course.

1048
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:49,250
Of course.
