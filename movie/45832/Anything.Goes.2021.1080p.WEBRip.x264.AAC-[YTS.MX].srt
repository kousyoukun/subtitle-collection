00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,640
You sure Crocker hasn't called?

4
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,600
He was supposed to meet me here
a half-hour ago.

5
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,720
Another drink while you're waiting,
Mr Whitney?

6
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,080
Please! Seven's my limit.

7
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,320
Hear you're off to England,
Mr Whitney.

8
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,080
Big stuff, Fred, the biggest.

9
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,120
Business, huh?
Henley Regatta.

10
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,080
Boot the Yale boat home.

11
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,680

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,760
Crocker! Where the hell have you
been? You're a half hour late.

15
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,080
Relax, bass, I have been
taking care of business.

16
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,840
I've got your steamer ticket,
English money, train ticket

17
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,760
up to Henley, and I picked
Little Eli up at Brooks Brothers.

18
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,960
New letter sweater looks terrific!

19
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,160
Oh!

20
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,240
What about my passport?

21
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,080
Nuts! Oh, I'm sorry, boss.

22
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,840
I'll pick it up first thing
in the morning,

23
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,320
and bring it to you
down on the boat.

24
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,800
Damn it, Crocker, I want you down on
Wall Street first thing

25
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,440
in the morning to sell
all my shares...

26
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,560
..to sell all my shares
of Amalgamated Prestoleum.

27
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,560
But boss, the firm's entire assets
are tied up in Amalgamated.

28
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,520
I got a hot tip
from Charlie Blodgett.

29
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,320
Amalgamated's going to sink
like the Titanic.

30
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,120
You always told me Charlie Blodgett
was a liar and a drunk.

31
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,480
He is.

32
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,080
But he's a Yale man.

33
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,520
One for the road, sir?

34
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,760
Yeah, make it a double.

35
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,160
Goodnight, gentlemen.

36
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,000
Anybody call for me, Fred?

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,560
Yeah, Harriet, Nancy, Lorraine...

38
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,960
Two Lorraines.

39
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,120
How about a Hope? Hope Harcourt?

40
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,600
No, but there was a lady came in
asking for you.

41
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,640
He's wrong, Billy. It was only me.

42
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,240
Reno!

43
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,360
Oh, my God. We had a date.

44
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,400
That's OK. I'd say forget it,
but you already did.

45
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,720
Reno, I am so sorry.

46
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,320
My boss is going to London
first thing in the morning,

47
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,520
I had a thousand things to do
for him.

48
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,960
I'M going to London in the morning,

49
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,760
and all you had to do for me
was buy me a drink.

50
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,040
What'll it be, ma'am?

51
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,600
A martini, only make it with rye and
put a cherry in it

52
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,760
instead of an olive.
Yeah, two Manhattans, Fred.

53
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,440
You know, I'm getting worried
about you, Billy.

54
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,520
I don't think this Wall Street job
is good for you.

55
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,080
Hey, I'm making $35 a week!

56
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,800
Yeah, but look at you.
Look at your coat.

57
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,440
What's the matter with my coat?
It's got a fried egg on the pocket.

58
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,720
That's an old school crest.

59
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,320
From where? PS 88?

60
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,760
You're in trouble, kid.

61
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,680
If you keep acting like
a stuffed shirt stockbroker,

62
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,120
you're going to turn into one.
Why do I put up with this, Fred?

63
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,920
You're nuts about me.

64
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,560
In fact, I've got a great idea.

65
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,760
Why don't you come to London
with me?

66
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,120
Reno, be serious.

67
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,040
I am serious.

153
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,320

154
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,480

Aye, aye, sir.

155
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,160
Would you just calm down?

156
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,800
How can I calm down?
We're about to spend six days

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,600
pretending to be something that
we're not, and why? Why?!

158
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,640
So we can hitch a free ride on the
world's classiest ocean liner,

159
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,000
that's why. And you think you're the
only person on this barge

160
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,720

not? Half the passengers...

where's the celebrities?

162
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,680

Are you serious, Captain?
Cut the bushwah.

169
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,320
As you no doubt have heard,

170
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,520
I'm on the way to the Westminster
conference where I shall present

171
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,920
my two newest converts,
Luke and John.

172
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,240
Luke here was a compulsive gambler,
who, as a reminder of his former

173
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,480
shame, still carries with him
a deck of cards.

174
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,640
And poor John
was a compulsive drinker...

175
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,160
Reno Sweeney! All right,
now getting somewhere!

176
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,720
I'll say. Hey, Reno, what are you
doing on board this tub?

177
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,640
Same thing I do at my nightclub,
boys.

178
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,240
I'll be saving sinners twice a night
in the ship's lounge.

179
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,440
I see you brought
the sinners with you.

180
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,960
Meet my angels.

181
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,000
Purity.
Hi.

182
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,120
Chastity.
Hi.

183
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,440
Charity.
Hi.

184
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,440
And I'm Virtue.

185
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,920
Hi.

186
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,640
The easy kind, no doubt.

187
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,440
Say, brother, was that a pass?

188
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,080
Miss Sweeney, I have no interest
in either you or your fallen angels.

189
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,400
I'm ashamed to be seen in public
with you.

190
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,160
How about a picture, boys?
Yes, please.

191
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
If you could just hold there.

192
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,040
Make sure to send a couple
to the Archbishop.

193
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,600
Luke! John!

194
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,840
Bye!
I tell you, boys,

195
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,400
it ain't easy being New York's
most notorious evangelist.

196
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,160
Come, who will lead this sinner
beside distilled waters?

197
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,040
What?

198
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,520
Which way to the bar?

199
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,280
Oh, just through there.
Thank you.

200
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,880
Oh, hey, girls,
give us the hallelujah.

201
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,480
Hallelujah!

202
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,800
Ooh!

203
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,840
Hey, look! Hope Harcourt!

204
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,960
Hey, Miss Harcourt, are you
presiding at the gold and silver

205
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,400
ball this year? How about the
Newport cotillion?

206
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,200
Gentlemen, my daughter's
debutante days are over.

207
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,320
She's about to be married.

208
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,800
Married?!
Yes, it's true.

209
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
I'm marrying Lord Evelyn Oakleigh.

210
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,880
We're getting married
at St Paul's Cathedral,

211
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,920
and I'm very, very happy.

212
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,360
Hey, Edith, how about a smooch?

213
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,840
I beg your pardon?

214
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,480
That's a kiss, your Highness.

215
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,680
No! How marvellous!

216
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,480
You know, I'm making a collection
of expressions you Americans use.

217
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,680
"A smooch is a kiss."

218
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,280
I say, darling, how about a smooch?

219
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,520
Egad! Evangeline Harcourt!

220
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,560
Elisha Whitney!

221
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,080
Down, boy, down.

222
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,160
Eli, you haven't changed
in 40 years.

223
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,520
Me?! Look at you!

224
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,080
You always did know
how to fill a girdle.

225
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,560
Eli, really!

226
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,440
Have some respect for the memory
of my late husband.

227
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,240
Of course, forgive me.

228
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,040
You know, if it's any consolation,
I was just coming out of

229
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,280
the stock exchange when he took off
from that ledge.

230
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,920
He jumped like a Yale man.

231
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,680
Thank you, Eli.

232
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,240
Boss, your passport.

233
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,400
Oh, my gosh!
Eli, you know my daughter Hope.

234
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,400
And this is her fiance,
Lord Evelyn Oakleigh.

235
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,720
Her fiance?

236
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,920
German word, Crocker.
It means they're getting married.

237
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,760
I don't believe it!
I still don't either.

238
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,160
And yet a week from now,
my little Hope will be a Lady.

239
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,640
This calls for a drink!
Come along, everybody.

240
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,320
Isn't Mr Crocker going to join us?

241
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,760
No, no. He's got a date
down on Wall Street.

242
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,720
Get going, Crocker,
and sell those shares.

243
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,320
Yes, sir.
This way, my dear.

244
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,600
Hope, wait...

245
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:24,840
All ashore that's going ashore.
All ashore that's going ashore.

246
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,120
Who is God?
The creator of all things.

247
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,120
Where is God?
God is everywhere.

248
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,680
And what does God know?

249
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,680
Who's going to win
the Kentucky derby.

250
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,000
You, have you seen a minister?

251
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,240
A what?

252
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,000
FBI. We're looking for a gangster
dressed up like a minister.

253
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,320
You seen him?
Yeah, he went that way.

254
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,240
Show us.
I've got to see somebody in the bar.

255
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,680
Show us.

256
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,560
Look, guys, I really don't have time
for this.

257
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,840
Was it this way?
This is ridiculous. Come on.

258
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,560
Psst! Moonie!

259
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,400
The coast is clear.
Erma!

260
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,160
Erma! Hey!

261
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,120
Are we in England yet?

262
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,240
Where's Snake Eyes?
He hasn't showed.

263
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,600
To hell with Snake Eyes!

264
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,280
Come on, he's public enemy number
one, he can take care of himself.

265
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,560
Oh, my God, you don't suppose
the cops nabbed him?

266
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,800
I've got to find him! Snake Eyes!

267
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,040
Snake Eyes!
Quiet! Quiet!

268
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,400
We're trying to make a getaway here,
OK? Mm-hm.

269
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,800
Erma, just...

270
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,720
Now look what you made me do.

271
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,360
That's my "straddle various."

272
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,160
Ah! A fellow cleric.

273
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,920
No, I'm out of here.

274
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,520
Allow me to introduce myself,
Doctor.

275
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,320
The Reverend Henry T Dobson.
Yeah.

276
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,640
Are you on your way
to the conference?

277
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,360
No, I was thinking of
going to bed early tonight, OK?

278
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,080
Oh, I mean the Westminster
conference.

279
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,440
No, you see,
I'm not a west minister.

280
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm more in the east.

281
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,040
What is your field, Doctor?

282
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,640
Me, I'm a missionary.

283
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,760
A missionary! Where?
Way out in China.

284
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,520
Oh, I served in China for years!

285
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,760
Oh, wow, that's amazing.

286
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,200
Well, I wasn't actually in China,
I was more...

287
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,560
Oh, I see, you were in Indochina.

288
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,800
That's right, I was,
it was Indoor China, yeah, yeah.

289
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,280
And you were...

290
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,120
Outdoor China!

291
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,240
That's so funny.

292
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,960
Yes. We'll have lots to talk about.

293
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,320
Sure.

294
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,280
I'm sorry?

295
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,280
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

296
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,640
Hey, there he is!

297
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,440
FBI! Gotcha, Moon.

298
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,240
Unhand me this instant!

299
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,120
I am the Reverend Henry T Dobson!

300
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,840
Save it for the judge, buddy.

301
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,320
Oh, my God, they're taking him away!

302
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,560
He's gone! He's gone!
What are we going to do?

303
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,120
Excuse me, captain,
is there a casino on the ship?

304
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,120
Why, no.

305
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,480
There is now.

306
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,920
Luke, stop! What are you doing?

307
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,920
We're going to end up in the brig!

308
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,720
I just wanted to say
bon voyage to the lady, boss.

309
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,760
You'll be saying bon voyage
to your job, Crocker,

310
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,960
unless you get the hell off
this boat!

311
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,200
I can find Snake Eyes anywhere!

312
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,640
What will I do? He's my man!
He's my life!

313
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,760
Erma, Erma, forget Snake Eyes!

314
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,720
Final call!

315
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,480
All ashore that's going ashore.

316
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,120
You blew it, Snake Eyes!

317
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,200
Now what'll I do with his passport
and ticket?

318
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,480
Could you let me have them?
Who are you?

319
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,440
Give him the goods, come on,
he saved my ass.

320
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,160
Thanks a lot.

321
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,000
"Murray Hill Cleaners."

322
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,720
Murray Hill Cleaners?
Where'd he get a name like that?

323
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,080
The Yellow Pages.

324
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,120

Oh, what am I doing?

328
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,640

525
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,080
Billy! You know, you're beautiful
when you're about to faint.

526
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,720
Billy, I didn't know
you were sailing!

527
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,760
I didn't either.
Then what are you doing here?

528
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,240
I'm selling life preservers.

529
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,760
No, Hope, I stowed away
to be with you.

530
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,880
I couldn't let you go.

531
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,360
Oh, Billy.

532
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,200
Oh, Billy, this is my fiance,
Evelyn Oakleigh.

533
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,760
Ah, Billy Crocker,
pleased to meet you!

534
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,160
Forgive me, I'm afraid I rather
overdid it in the dining room.

535
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,480
Me too. Did you have the
sweetbreads?

536
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,240
Best brains I ever ate.

537
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,760
Billy! Although I've never seen them
serve that way before,

538
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,600
with jellied eels and headcheese.

539
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,280
Billy, stop it!
Night, all!

540
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,160
Billy, was that fair?

541
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,640
Fair? I find you standing here
in the moonlight with him.

542
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,880
I didn't shoot him,
I didn't push him overboard,

543
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,360
I thought I was more than fair.

544
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,120
You're being terribly bad, Billy.

545
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,520
Why, we hardly know each other.

546
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,920
"Hardly know each other"?

547
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,480
We met one night at a party, we
danced, had a little too much wine,

548
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,680
we took a little spin
round the park.

549
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,720
You call five hours in the back
of a taxi "a little spin"?

550
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,200
Four hours. Five, remember you
fell asleep after we...?

551
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,760
I remember.

552
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,560
And then I took you down
to that little cafe by the docks.

553
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,960
We ate breakfast
as the sun came up.

554
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,040
Yeah, we talked about going
to California

555
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,800
and getting a little bungalow,
raising orange trees.

556
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,120
Raising kids.

557
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,360
Billy, that was a fantasy.

558
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,280
Things like that just aren't done.

559
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,840
Yeah!

560
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,120
Yeah, I guess you're right.

561
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,040
Me and you, huh?

562
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,080

Where do you think you're going?

is going to show me

Oh, I've got to lay low for a while.

643

I don't think the Purser believes
I'm Murray Hill Cleaners.

Well, maybe I can assist you
in some way.

645
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,080
I don't think a minister
can help me, Doc.

646

The girl I'm in love with
is going to marry another guy.

647
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,240

you belong to, Doc,

Watch me go.

654
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,840

Yeah, I think I need a shave myself.

659
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,920
What?!

660
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,160
What the hell?

661
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,680
Padre! What are you doing here?

662
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,160
I've come to take up the collection.

663
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,880
I thought you did that
in the chapel.

664
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,640
Why, are you planning
to attend chapel?

665
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,080
Yeah, well, no.

666
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,160
Then pony up, or I'll come back
in the morning

667
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,760
when you're nursing your hangover.

668
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,920
Look at that, that's funny, I seem

Can you read the initials in there?

670
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,160
Achoo!

671
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,920
Bless you.
No, bless you.

672
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,600
Where are my glasses?

673
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,680
Are you sure you had them on
when you barged in here?

674
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,000
What? This is my stateroom!

675
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,400
Then what am I doing in here?

676
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,360
I've never been so insulted
in all my life!

677
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,200
Yeah, so I stole his glasses.

678
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,600
Now we're going to be OK as long as
the captain doesn't show up.

679
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,400
Who is it?
The captain.

680
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,720
Oh! One moment, please.

681
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,200
Quick, hide him, hide him.

682
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,080
One moment, thank you.

683
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,720
Yeah, come in.

684
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,640
And that, my dear, is how Goliath
slayed Moses and the whale.

685
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,720
Amen. Sorry to disturb you, Doctor,
but does a Mr Murray Hill Cleaners

686
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,120
occupy this cabin?

687
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,920
No, not very often.
Why? Is something wrong?

688
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,560
We've had a radiogram
from Washington.

689
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,720
The man you're travelling with
is not Murray Hill Cleaners.

690
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,200

Wow, Santa Claus-a.

Don't worry, Doctor,
my men can handle him.

694
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,520
If he does turn up,
just give a shout.

695
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,880
Just practising.

696
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
Get him out. Get him out.

697
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,040
Stop me if I'm out of line, Doc,

698
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,600
but I don't think
you're really a minister.

699
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,240
OK, kid, I'm going
to level with you. All right?

700
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,360
I'm not really a minister.

701
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,520
I'm Moonface Martin.

702
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,760
The famous gangster.

703
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,960
Yeah, public enemy number 13.

704
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,240
Help. Police.

705
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,480
Shut it, Erma.

706
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,200
Hey, hey, hey! You're not going
to turn me in, are you?

707
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,440
Doc, relax, we're pals.
Then where you going?

708
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,160
Well, I've got a wedding to bust up.
No, you can't go out there.

709
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,720
The captain thinks
you're Snake Eyes Johnson.

710
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,720
Hey, what I need is a disguise.

711
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,200
Oh, yeah, what? Like a gorilla suit
or a suit of armour or something?

712
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,960
Or a sailor suit. Yeah.
You want a sailor suit?

713
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,600
No problem.

714
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,320

Sailor? Yes, sir. Keep this quiet.
He is public enemy number one.

746
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,280
We don't want to set off a panic
amongst the passengers.

747
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,760
You check the foredeck and report
to me on the bridge. Aye, aye, sir.

748
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,720
And remember,
he is a master of disguise.

749
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,880
This is ridiculous. These pants
must be six inches too short.

750
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,680
Yeah, I don't think Erma picked
the guy for the length of his pants.

751
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,840
Pull!

752
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,400
Don't shoot! I'm...
Hallelujah the Lord.

753
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,520
Excuse me, sir, what was that noise?

754
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,280
That was the trapshooting contest.
Crapshooting contest?

755
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,640
Skeet shooting, Doctor. Yeah.
First prize is $100.

756
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,240
Whoa! Hey, can you use your own gun?

757
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,160
Of course. Yeah, see you later.
Hey, wait a minute!

758
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,320
Ahem! Wait!

759
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,600
Pull!

760
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,760
Miss!

761
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,240
{\an8}Really, mother, we didn't lose
all our money in the crash.

762
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,720
Why, if I changed my mind right now

763
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,560
and decided not to marry Evelyn,
we'd be fine.

764
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,840
We would not be fine!

765
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,000
You too haven't quarrelled,
have you?

766
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,560
Oh, dear!

767
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,880
I'm going to marry him, mother.

768
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,160
Everything will be all right.
Oh, good.

769
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,440
Pull!

770
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,640
Miss!

771
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,480
Pull!

772
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,640
Miss! Pull!

773
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,640
Hey, hey, yeah!

774
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,280
Excuse me, ma'am,
are you Mrs Evangeline Harcourt?

775
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,720
Why, yes. Oh, no. The captain has
asked me to find you.

776
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,080
The ship has hit an iceberg.

777
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,400
Ssh!

778
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,240
All the lifeboats are leaking
except one,

779
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,560
the captain is saving the last two
places for you and your daughter.

780
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,080
Billy, this isn't fair.
Who cares if it's fair?

781
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,680
The ship is sinking. I'm going to...

782
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,920
Oh, do I have time to go back
for my jewellery?

783
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,920
Hurry, and remember,
not a word to anyone.

784
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,480
I hope you're proud of yourself,
Billy.

785
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,160
Now that you mention it, I am.

786
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,720
12 hours after you tell me
to leave you alone forever,

787
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,920
I've got you all to myself.

788
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,800
Oops, sorry, madam.

789
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,720
Not quite all to yourself.
Good morning, Mr Whitney.

790
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,840
Oh, hello, my dear.
Yeah, I'm looking for a sailor.

791
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,440
Take a look at this one.
Ah, now, I want to send a wire.

792
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,120
This goes to William Crocker,
Whitney Building, New York City.

793
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,200
"Crocker, wire confirmation
of amalgamated sale at once."

794
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,520
Got that? Mm-hm.
Better have him read it back.

795
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,960
"Crocker, wire confirmation

796
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,200
"of amalgamated sale at once."

797
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,040
You know, you remind me of somebody.
Look out!

798
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,360
What was that?
The biggest seagull I ever saw!

799
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,840
What?

800
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,920
Oh! Got to run! I'll see you later!

801
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,920
They've gone!

802
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,120
Oh, captain, thank God!

803
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,240
Where do I go?

804
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,360
Where would you like to go?

805
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:16,680
The lifeboat. Oh, the lifeboat drill
is tomorrow morning, madam.

806
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,080
But the sailor told us...
Told you what?

807
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,600
That the ship is sinking.

808
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:24,360
What?! A joke, ladies and gentlemen.

809
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,320
She's only joshing.

810
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,600
I suggest you have a little talk
with the ship's doctor, madam.

811
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,760
And in the meantime,
stay out of the bar.

812
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,200
Go on, go on, just do what
I told you. But what if it's...?

813
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:50,080
Excuse me, Father. Yeah? Can I
assist you in some way, my son?

814
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,920
Brother Luke has been
playing cards... Mm-hm.

815
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,200
Look. Yeah, that's the wages of sin.

816
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,000
For shame,
go hail a few Marys, will you?

817
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,600
So, you've been playing cards, yeah?

818
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,800
Can you shoot craps?

819
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,520
No. Kneel, Christian. Watch closely.

820
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,360
Right, put up your money.
I've put up my money.

821
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,640
I throw a number.

822
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,240
If I throw the same number
before I throw a seven, I win.

823
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,040
If not, you win.

824
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,520
Bah!

825
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,080
Craps! I win.

826
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,800
There's something wrong here.

827
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,040
{\an8}Hey, thanks a lot. Yeah,
don't mention it. What did I do?

828
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,280
{\an8}You walked out on me.

829
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,880
I nearly got nailed by my boss,

830
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,040
and everyone's pointing at me
in this stupid disguise.

831
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,400
Don't knock the disguise! Come on,
it's practically as good as mine.

832
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,120
Hey, Billy, how you doing? Uh-huh...

833
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,280
Moonface Martin, long time, no see!

834
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,080
Reno, quiet! OK, quiet!

835
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,160
You don't know me. I'm a hunted man.

836
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,120
Oh, there he is! Don't shoot!

837
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,200
I'm flying fish,
there go the flying fish. My God.

838
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,280
Dr, have you seen Mr Cleaners? Yeah.

839
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,440
As a matter of fact, I think I saw
him going into the mizzen mast.

840
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,560
We don't have a mizzen mast.
Yeah, must have been someone else.

841
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,040
Sailor, come with me. I want you
to help me find someone.

842
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,200
Aye, aye, sir.

843
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,640
Who's he looking for?
He's looking for Billy.

844
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,960
Billy ought to be a big help to him.

845
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:23,440
What-ho! It's Reno Sweeney.
I say, Lord Evelyn Oakleigh.

846
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,120
Might I have your autograph?

847
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:29,120
Why not? Do you know, I spent the
most smashing night in your club.

848
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,040
Lawdy lawdy! Saints preserve us!

849
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,400
Your singing stirred me
into a frenzy.

850
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,760
Had me dancing about like Bojingles.

851
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,480
Thank you.

852
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,160
"Are you drunk or crazy?
Good luck, Reno Sweeney."

853
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,800
Oh, I say, why don't we all have tea
in my cabin?

854
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,160
I know that my fiance, Ms Harcourt,
would love to meet you.

855
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,120
That's very sweet of you,
but I'm afraid that...

856
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:56,440
Yeah, she'd love to. Oh, marvellous!
Shall we say four o'clock?

857
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,440
Four o'clock? Four o'clock?

858
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,640
See you later...elevator.

859
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,840
Mooney, that's the tommy that's been
making time with Billy's girl.

860
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,880
This is going to be like consorting
with the enemy. Exactly.

861
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,320
Here's the plan, right,
you get to his cabin

862
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,640
nice and early wearing something
that slips off easy.

863
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,280
I bust in, I catch him
tearing your clothes off,

864
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,120
and then we blackmail him
into breaking off the engagement.

00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,440
I've got hot pants for you!

1036
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,040
You come any closer and I'll shoot!

1037
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,360
I'm so sorry!

1038
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,360
{\an8}Evening, folks! I trust
you're enjoying the crossing.

1039
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,440
This is the dullest passenger list
I've ever seen.

1040
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:12,280
There's nobody on board
but nobodies. No celebrities.

1041
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:17,120
I want celebrities!
Oh, well, um, how about...

1042
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:20,360
..Gertrude Ederle?
The Channel swimmer?

1043
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,920
Is she onboard?
Not exactly, but there she goes.

1044
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,560
Well, I never!
What does he take us for?

1045
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,560
It's like crossing on a tug boat.

1046
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,720
Next time, I'm booking with Cunard.

1047
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,520
What does Hope see in that guy?

1048
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,240
Hey, it must be her mother.

1049
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,680
Yeah. She's the one behind all this.
Hey, I could shoot the mother.

1050
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,800
Moon! No, OK, I got another plan.

1051
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,120
Yeah, well, I hope it's better
than the last one.

1052
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,840
Any sign of that criminal yet, men?
Not yet, sir.

1053
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,400
Apprehend that man immediately.
Aye, aye, sir.

1054
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:56,360
And if you see any celebrities,
apprehend them too. Yes, sir.

1055
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,640
Hey, did you hear that?

1056
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,000
I gotta do something about
this disguise. Whoa!

1057
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,760
Stay out of the kitchen

1058
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,840
or I'll put you on the menu.

1059
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:07,240
Sailor, find out who this
belongs to.

1060
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,680
Aye-aye, sir.

1061
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:11,680
Now, if only I had a beard
or a phoney moustache.

1062
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,560
Whoo!

1063
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:30,160
Cheeky! Oh...

1064
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,000
Where is that dog?

1065
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,960
Now, now. They always find their way
home.

1066
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,720
His home is in Oyster Bay,
Long Island.

1067
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,680
Be calm, my dear.

1068
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,080
Oh, you're a trembling fawn.

1069
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,840
Here, have a snort.

1070
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:48,720
I told you, Eli, liquor has never
touched my lips.

1071
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,720
You know a shortcut?

1072
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:57,520
Cheeky! Come here, doggie.

1073
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,160
Cheeky! Oh, Evangeline.

1074
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,400
Just look at the moon, huh?

1075
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,960
This night was made for romance,
my sweet.

1076
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,080
Will you marry me?

1077
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,120
I'm afraid I can't, sir.
I'm already married. What?

1078
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:23,560
But there is a lady round the corner
looking for a dog...

1079
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:26,200
Why don't you try her? Yeah. Um...
Thank you.

1080
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,880
You're welcome.

1081
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,640
How does it feel...? Cheeky!

1082
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,720
Quick, get rid of him! What do you
do with a dog?

1083
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,600
Just get rid of him.
I know, I'll put him down here.

1084
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,520
Stop. Stop, stop.

1085
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,760
Oh, where is that dog?

1086
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,040
Cheeky!

1087
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,480
Agh!

1088
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,760
Dear me. Are you all right?

1089
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,120
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine now.

1090
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,800
Oh, Captain! Captain, thank God!

1091
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,960
I need your help.

1092
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,240
What is it this time, madam?

1093
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:16,760
I can't find my little Cheeky.

1094
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,840
Why, it's right beside
your little nosy!

1095
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,520
Ohh!

1096
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,440
How could you do that?

1097
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,600
Oh, relax. Dogs are good swimmers.

1098
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,280
This way, men!

1099
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,360
We'll check the library, then
the ballroom.

1100
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:39,080
He's got to be on board somewhere.

1101
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,280
Ka-ta! Ka-ta!

1102
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,280
Are you sure this is going to work?

1103
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,720
Look, come on. Do you want me to
take care of the mother or not?

1104
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,120
Here she is.

1105
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,600
Excuse me, miss.

1106
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,200
We're from old London town.

1107
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:10,120
And we're looking for Lord Evelyn
Oakleigh. Do you know him?

1108
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,880
I should say so.
He's going to marry my daughter.

1109
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,280
Oh, no!

1110
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,720
Is something wrong?

1111
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,440
Allow me to introduce myself.

1112
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,480
I am Lord Evelyn Oakleigh.

1113
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:22,400
The man you think you know as
Lord Evelyn Oakleigh

1114
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,520
is, in reality, my brother.

1115
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,440
Edna. Edna.

1116
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:29,400
Your brother Edna? That's right.

1117
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,640
His real name's Mona, but he
changed it, you see,

1118
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,040
cos he's a bit deranged, you know?

1119
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:38,440
Several months ago, he escaped from
the family suite at Bedlam.

1120
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,000
You have a family suite at Bedlam?
That's right.

1121
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,200
I was driving him down to Savile
Row for his new straitjacket

1122
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,880
and suddenly, blinky-blonky, didn't
half give me the slip, he did.

1123
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,440
Who is this man?

1124
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,600
Oh! My brother's keeper.
Oh, dear me.

1125
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,800
Oh, this is most upsetting.

1126
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,720
It's all right. Don't worry.
We know how to handle him.

1127
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,320
Oh, yes. We have been through this
a million times.

1128
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,080
You mean this has happened before?

1129
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,640
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1130
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:07,160
He marries 'em, murders 'em,
marries 'em and murders 'em. Ohh!

1131
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,120
Murders their mothers.

1132
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,680
Ohh!

1133
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,480
But he seemed so normal. No... They
all say that!

1134
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,160
She doesn't know the signs.
The telltale signs.

1135
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,880
The fatal signs. The fatal signs.
What signs?

1136
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,480
There's a certain phrase he uses.
Just before he snaps.

1137
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,480
Have you ever heard him say...?
- What-ho!
- That's it!

1138
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:28,960
Edna... Ssh! I mean, Evelyn!

1139
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,040
I've been looking everywhere for
you, Mums.

1140
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,000
I say, how do you like it?

1141
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,840
Agh! Jesus Christ!

1142
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,800
Dear me, is she all right? She's all
right. She's just playing dead.

1143
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:41,280
Oh, my God, Mother!
Mother! Billy, what have you done?

1144
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,880
Hope, I can explain everything.

1145
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,360
You just don't know when to stop,
do you, Billy?

1146
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,720
His name isn't Billy, dear.
It's Evelyn.

1147
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,440
And Evelyn isn't Evelyn.

1148
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,000
He's Edna.

1149
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:55,720
And Edna's really Mona. I'll show
you who he is!

1150
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,920
It's him!
Hey, he's getting away!

1151
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,240
Come on, after him!

1152
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,200
Evelyn, will you please take
Mrs Harcourt back to her cabin?

1153
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,600
Right-ho. Oh, dear me. What else
can go wrong?

1154
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,320
There, there, Mums. Cheer up.

1155
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,400
Woof! Woof! Oh...

1156
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,200
Cheeky!

1157
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,280
How long are you going to keep up
this ridiculous act?

1158
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,760
I beg your pardon? You're in love
with him.

1159
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,480
Why don't you just admit it? I
really don't think that this is...

1160
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,320
He may want you now, but he's not
going to stick around for ever.

1161
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,400
Half the women in New York are crazy
about him.

1162
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,160
Why, just the other night, one of
the best-looking dames I know

1163
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:32,000
practically proposed to him.
She did? Well, who was she?

1164
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,360
Me.

1165
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,680
Oh, I'm sorry. Forgive me.

1166
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,080
I just can't help it.

1167
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,640
Eh?

1168
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,920
I said,
I just can't help it!

1169
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,640
Oh, if only I'd have told him how
I really feel...

1170
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,080
How's that?

1171
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,640
I'm crazy about him.

1172
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,000
Eh?

1173
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,320
I said, I'm crazy about him!

1174
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,560
This is tragic.

1175
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:18,000
I've ruined my life!
I've ruined his life!

1176
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,040
I've ruined everything.

1177
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:23,800
Oh, things don't look that bad
to me.

Listen, kid, I just saw Hope.
She's all broken up. Aw!

1377
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,560
Oh, tough guy, huh? Suppose I told
you she wants to marry you.

1378
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:25,440
You're kidding me. She said that?
No.

1379
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,800
Come on, Billy, you know she's
nuts about you.

1380
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,840
She wants to marry you. She just
hasn't got the guts to say so.

1381
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,200
Ladies and gentlemen,

1382
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,560
Miss Sweeney's service is about
to begin.

1383
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:41,280
Last call for drinks before
the service.

1384
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:42,680
Hey, showtime, toots!

1385
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:46,520
I would appreciate if you would
cease addressing me as "toots",

1386
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:49,360
and henceforth call me by
my right name -

1387
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:52,080
Mrs Moonface Martin!

1388
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,480
Yeah.

1389
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:55,400
M-M-Mwah!

1390
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,320
R-R-Rargh! R-R-Rargh!

1391
01:26:57,320 --> 01:27:00,440
R-R-R... Rargh!

1392
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:01,640
Rargh.

1393
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:04,600
Let me guess - you performed the
ceremony yourself?

1394
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,600
Oh, God, it's not legal, is it?

1395
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:12,320
Miss Sweeney's service will
do you good, Eli.

1396
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:15,400
You need to reform your ways.

1397
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,680
What's the matter with my ways?

1398
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:20,400
You proposed to a sailor!

1399
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:23,600
I'm a lonely man, Evangeline.

1400
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,840
Hey, Dudley, get a load of this.

1401
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:28,920
My dear,

1402
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:32,400
may I say you look like
a million bucks!

1403
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,560
Thanks, fellas. I'm touched.

1404
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,040
Wah!

1405
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:37,880
That's an expression.

1406
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:41,040
Evelyn, I really don't feel
up to this.

1407
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,600
I want to go back to my cabin.

1408
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:44,120
Don't be silly, darling.

1409
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,800
Look, it's Snake Ears!

1410
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,360
Evelyn, no! I say!

1411
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,120
Mr Johnson! Mr Johnson.

1412
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,960
Who am I?

1413
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:53,520
You dirty rat!

1414
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,960
You dirty rat.

1415
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:58,720
Noel Coward.

1416
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,960
Oh, damn. Evelyn, stop it.

1417
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,040
Hey, you want to make her happy,
pal?

1418
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,720
Do an imitation of me.

1419
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,520
You can be very cruel.

1420
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,400
That's how he got to be Number One.

1421
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,040
Hope, wait. Come on.

1422
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:13,560
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

1423
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:17,160
the SS American is pleased
to present

1424
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:20,080
the world's most sensuous
sermoniser,

1425
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:22,520
Her High—Stepping Holiness,

1426
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,800
Miss Reno Sweeney!

1427
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,240
Hush!

1428
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:38,760
Brothers and sisters, we are here
tonight to fight the Devil.

1429
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:42,520
There's only one way to fight
the Devil,

1430
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,280
and that's in the open.

1431
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:47,280
I want each of you to turn to his
neighbour and say,

1432
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,640
"Bless you, brother.
Bless you, sister."

1433
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:51,880
Bless you, brother.
Bless you, sister.

1434
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:54,280
There's only one way to send the
Devil packing

1435
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:55,920
and that's to confess your sins.

1436
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:59,440
Who will be the first to speak out
and say, "I'm a sinner"?

1437
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,040
I'm a sinner!

1438
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:03,960
Hallelujah! Thank you, sister.
Who's next?

1439
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:05,640
I'm a sinner.

1440
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,760
Hallelujah! Who's next?

1441
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,960
Go ahead, Eli.

1442
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:14,920
Ahem. Well...

1443
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,920
..there was a time when I drank.

1444
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:19,760
Yeah? What time was that?
Half an hour ago?

1445
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,400
Hallelujah!

1446
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:23,600
I'm cursed with sex appeal!

1447
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,520
It's been my downfall.

1448
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:29,040
She's not confessing.
She is advertising.

1449
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:30,840
Hallelujah!

1450
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:34,040
Come on, get busy. Who will give us
a real confession?

1451
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:35,720
Um... I say,

1452
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:37,160
may I have a go?

1453
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:40,400
Speak up, brother,
I want to hear this.

1454
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,960
Um...

1455
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:45,000
While I was visiting Singapore
some time ago,

1456
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,120
there was a girl named Plum Blossom

1457
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:49,000
of whom I became extremely fond.

1458
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,480
Eventually, we made a bit of
unpremeditated whoopee

1459
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:53,080
in the willows...

1460
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,200
..and I enjoyed it very much.

1461
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:06,840
I was worried about you, brother,
but I feel much better now!

1462
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:08,600
Hallelujah!

1463
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,960
Do you hear that playing?

1464
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:13,760
Yes, I hear that playing.

1465
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:16,080

1466
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,040

Three weeks ago, I met a girl
and I...

1550
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,640
Well, I fell in love with her.

1551
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:14,560
How did I show it?

1552
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,480
I hounded her.

1553
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,560
I embarrassed her.

1554
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:21,320
I made her cry.

1555
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:24,640
I'm sorry... Hope.

1556
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:28,040
I just want you to be happy.

1557
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:29,720
I'll never bother you again.

1558
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:33,320
What's going on? He doesn't sound
like Snake Eyes Johnson. I'm not.

1559
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:37,040
I'm not a gangster. I'm just a
broken-down broker.

1560
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:40,040
Then he's a phoney!
I want my money back.

1561
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:41,920
They ought to give him the chair.

1562
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:44,200
Purser, clap that man in irons!
Yeah!

1563
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:46,600
Get behind me, kid.
We'll shoot our way out.

1564
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:57,480
There's something
definitely wrong here.

1565
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,480
Captain?

1566
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,000
Yes, madam?

1567
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,720
Captain, is it true that you have
the authority

1568
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:10,080
to perform weddings on board
this vessel?

1569
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:14,880
It is, madam. Then I would like you
to schedule one for 10am tomorrow.

1570
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:18,440
These young people are eager
to get married,

1571
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:21,120
and they would like to do so

1572
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:24,160

1573
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:25,680
Mother...

1574
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:28,040

1575
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:29,840

Now, don't tell me what it is.

1603
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:36,440
I don't want to play cards.
What do you want to do, shoot craps?

1604
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:39,760
Yeah. I was thinking of shooting

I'm never going to see her again.
You know your problem, kid?

1614
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:05,960
You got no philosophy. You know,
life has taught me

A song that always cheered me
when I was blue.

1621
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:33,200
Even Melba said this bush song

1622
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:36,040
was a helluva song to sing.

01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:05,960
Make that, here's to the groom.

1724
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:12,080
Miss Sweeney, you see before you
a man staggered by a revelation.

1725
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:15,480
It hit me like a stone hammer in the
middle of your service.

1726
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:19,160
The woman I am destined to marry
tomorrow

1727
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:21,000
is not one and the same

1728
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,800
with the woman I love.

1729
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:25,280
You mean you're not in love
with Hope?

1730
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:26,560
That's great!

1731
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:28,880
I mean, gee, it's a good thing you
found out.

1732
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:30,760
I mean, just in time,
and everything.

1733
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:33,000
Ah, there's the rub.

1734
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:37,480
You know the Oakleigh family moto?

1735
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:43,720
Nostrum fuglium sentorum.
What does that mean?

1736
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:45,520
No-one really knows.

1737
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:53,120
But we're not supposed to go around
backing out of engagements.

1738
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:56,320
Ah, well...

1739
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:01,040
Adieu, Miss Sweeney.

1740
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:08,360
You know, there's just one thing I
can't figure.

1741
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:11,520
That whoopee in the willows
business

1742
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:13,520
with Plum Blossom.

1743
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:17,320
How does that fit in with
nostrum fuglium whatever?

1744
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:20,120
Goodness, this is most embarrassing.

1745
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:22,000
Must I explain?

1746
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,600
It's your motto.

1747
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:28,200
Miss Sweeney, I've never told this
to anyone before.

1748
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:31,920
It's the Oakleigh family secret.

1749
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:36,120
There's something wild
and passionate in our souls.

1750
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:38,280

They cleaned out third class
playing craps.

1792

Some folks are pretty hot about it.

1793
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:43,680
What about us? When are we getting

hand.

get out of here.

the greatest thing that can happen
to a person just happened to me!

1803
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:11,400
You got parole? No, she's in love!

1804
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:14,960
And what's more, Evelyn is in love
with me.

1805
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:16,440
What? That's great.

1806
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:19,880
In fact, it's perfect. Yeah. That's
right, cos Reno gets to marry

1807
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:22,200
Evelyn, and Billy gets to marry
Hope!

1808
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:24,600
That only leaves one little problem.
What's that?

1809
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:26,360
How do I put this? Let me out!

1810
02:01:26,360 --> 02:01:28,800
Reno, we've got to think of
something.

1811
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:32,400
Yeah, if only we were them. Them?
Yeah, they get out in an hour.

you're wearing there.

1882
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:03,480
My colleague and I are barristers

1883
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:05,840

Treacle, Treacle & Custard,

Distinguished clients?

1887
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:15,960
Permit me to explain.

1888
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:19,960
My clients have just come completed
an extensive peregrination

1889
02:08:19,960 --> 02:08:21,960
in order to confirm most urgently

1890
02:08:21,960 --> 02:08:23,760
with this English gentleman.

1891
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:27,840

were, the nick of time!

1892
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:30,920
I'm afraid if you've come in
reference to my Hong Kong interests,

1893
02:08:30,920 --> 02:08:33,440
you've chosen a bad moment. I'm
about to be married.

1894
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:35,800
The marriage is impossible.
Impossible?

1895
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:37,600
What on earth do you mean?

1896
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:42,920
Allow me to introduce the mortified
father of little Plum Blossom.

1897
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:48,600
And who is little Plum Blossom?

1898
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:50,680
Yes, who is little Plum Blossom?

1899
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:52,960
This is little Plum Blossom.

1900
02:09:04,440 --> 02:09:06,920
I'm not sure I follow this.

1901
02:09:06,920 --> 02:09:10,520
Lord Evelyn took Plum Blossom to a
willow grove

1902
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:13,040
and returned with a Plum tart.

1903
02:09:14,640 --> 02:09:17,760
Dear me! Is this really true?

1904
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:24,480
I'm afraid so. Evelyn, is this woman
really... Plum tart Blossom?

1905
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:26,960
I can't really say.

1906
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:28,880
It all happened so long ago.

1907
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:30,560
Oh, good Lord!

1908
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:35,280
Apologies to one and all.
But under the circumstances,

1909
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:38,240
I don't see how I can possibly marry
Miss Harcourt.

1910
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:41,560
Don't be ridiculous. All these
people want is money.

1911
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:43,720
I'll give you $1,000 to clear out.

1912
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:45,920
We'll take it. Do not insult our
clients

1913
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:47,600
with an offer of filthy money!

1914
02:09:47,600 --> 02:09:50,480
I'll make it $2,000! You cannot buy
the honour.

1915
02:09:50,480 --> 02:09:52,400
I'll make it $5,000!

1916
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:54,240
Yeah, yeah, honour sold.

1917
02:09:54,240 --> 02:09:55,960
No, Mr Whitney, don't pay him.

1918
02:09:55,960 --> 02:09:58,720
No amount of money can undo this
great wrong.

1919
02:09:58,720 --> 02:10:02,600
You, sir, you are related to little
Plum Blossom?

1920
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:05,000
Like an O'Neill drama to
Whistler's mom.

1921
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,840
Then the only way to repay this
debt of honour, Evelyn,

1922
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:10,120
is for you to offer him...me!

1923
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:11,680
No!

1924
02:10:11,680 --> 02:10:14,200
Oh, I say! What a marvellous idea!

1925
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:17,320
Offer accepted! Congratulations,
old boy.

1926
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:20,160
You're getting quite a girl.
What about the five grand?

1927
02:10:20,160 --> 02:10:22,800
Say, why does the English gentleman
not join the club

1928
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:25,200
and right the wrong done to poor
Plum Blossom?

1929
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:27,720
Right the wrong done to poor
Plum...? Oh, I say.

1930
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:31,800
Well, confound it, why not?

1931
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:33,600
Now, look here,

1932
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:35,560
Plum Blossom.

1933
02:10:37,960 --> 02:10:39,640
Will you marry me?

1934
02:10:39,640 --> 02:10:42,760
Oh, sweetie, I thought you'd
never ask!

1935
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:44,560
Why, Mother, what's the matter?

1936
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:46,240
What's the matter?

1937
02:10:46,240 --> 02:10:48,160
We're poor again!

1938
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:51,880
I shall have to spend
the rest of my life

1939
02:10:51,880 --> 02:10:55,120
living in hotels...

1940
02:10:56,040 --> 02:10:58,120
Like hell you will!

1941
02:10:58,120 --> 02:11:00,400
Marry me, Evangeline!

1942
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:03,760
Say yes, and spend the rest of your
life in the lap of luxury.

1943
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:05,520
Why, after that amalgamated deal,

1944
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:08,640
I'm so damn rich I could buy
this tub

1945
02:11:08,640 --> 02:11:10,760
and turn it into a private yacht
for you.

1946
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:13,760
Eli! My saviour!

1947
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:16,880
My knight in shining armour!

1948
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:20,080
Ah, Mr Whitney... Uh?

1949
02:11:20,080 --> 02:11:22,080
Oh, thank you, Crocker.

1950
02:11:22,080 --> 02:11:24,160
Yes, sir. Crocker!

1951
02:11:24,160 --> 02:11:25,920
How the hell did you get on board?

1952
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:27,680
I have a confession to make.

1953
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:30,000
I never made it to the Stock
Exchange.

1954
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
I stowed away aboard this ship.

1955
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:35,160
I never sold those amalgamated
shares.

1956
02:11:35,160 --> 02:11:38,160
You never sold the shares?
You never sold the shares?!

1957
02:11:38,160 --> 02:11:40,480
That means I'm ruined!

1958
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:41,840
Ruined!

1959
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:44,600
Oh, I'm sorry, boss.

1960
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:49,560
Oh, well, at least I have someone to
comfort me

1961
02:11:49,560 --> 02:11:51,480
in my misfortune.

1962
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:57,360
Well... Mr Whitney! Mr Whitney,
urgent cable from New York, sir.

1963
02:11:57,360 --> 02:12:00,440
Amalgamated just went through
the roof.
