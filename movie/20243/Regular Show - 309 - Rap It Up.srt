1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,500
好 下一个是谁
Alright, so who's next?

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,810
谁觉得自己可以打败传说中的帮派帮
Who thinks they can take on the legendary CrewCrew?

3
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:14,810
帮派帮
CrewCrew!

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,440
看起来大麻烦还想要更多
Looks like Big Trouble's back for more.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,370
老兄 另一场对战要开始了
Dude, another battle's about to start!

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,850
天 这个人每个星期都过来
Man, this dude is back every week.

7
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,570
不 我这次要打败你们所有笨蛋 放beat
Nah, I got y'all fools this time, hit it!

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,210
你们最好都看好
You all better watch out,

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,670
因为大麻烦现在拿着mic
cause Big Trouble's on the mic now,

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,550
我要把你们都击倒
I'll knock all o' your lights out,

11
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,290
你们都被我的句子诅咒 爆炸像个烟花
with my verse, y'all be cursed, blowing up like fireworks.

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,560
就这样? 闪彗星 给这个笨蛋看看我们的水平
That's it? Blitz Comet, show this fool how we do.

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,200
闪彗星在台上
Blitz Comet on the scene.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,330
你走进我只能拿到奶油玉米
You step to me and you gonna get creamed-corn!

15
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,560
你的嘴超臭 你这个疯子只能做酷的反义词
All up in your teeth, you reek, you're the opposite of chic, ya freak!

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,730
你的段子都太旧
Your ryhmes are all antiques.

17
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,080
没人想听都扔到一边
Nobody wants em, they throw em all away.

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,460
一开始你的脑子就像在卡壳
Right from the get go like your brain is on delay.

19
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,970
我看你应该去做做检查
Matter of fact yo, you better get a check up.

20
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,730
问问你得医生 为什么你脖子上面那么丑
Go ask your doctor, why you be so ugly from the neck UP?

21
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,890
不好意思
Excuse me.

22
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,120
帕布在干嘛
What is Pops doing?

23
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,780
拥抱多美妙
A hug can be a wonderful thing.

24
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,680
两臂围绕如母亲的翅膀
Two arms wrapped around you like a mother's wing.

25
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,130
但我们忧郁又自私
But we're so selfish when we are blue.

26
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,480
一个拥抱难道不值得另一个拥抱
Doesn't a hug deserve a hug too?

27
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,660
谢谢
Thank you.

28
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,230
哟 他在说什么 等等等 等一下
Yo, whatcha say? Nah, nah, nah, nah, hold on man.

29
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,720
你要加入我们
You trying to step to us?

30
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,200
我只是因为有同好诗人感到激动
I'm just so excited to hear some fellow poets.

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,280
我认为我可以加入你们歌颂韵律之美
I thought I come join you in the celebration of rhymes.

32
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,910
不不不不不 你没有在歌颂什么
Nah, nah, nah, nah, you're not celebrating nothin'!

33
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,340
嘿 机器人V 放Beat
Yo V-Tron, turn it up.

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,830
吔 帮派帮锁定你 说两次 别忘记
Yeah, CrewCrew's coming at you. Say it twice, don't forget it.

35
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,900
你最好看看我们在干嘛
Y'all better catch up to where we're at.

36
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,640
你太过时 比不上我们酷毙的压韵
You're behind the times. Can't compete with our dope rhymes.

37
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,790
所以你最好离开
So you better say your goodbyes.

38
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,850
我们有佛朗科 闪彗星 机器人V 泽西仔在说唱
We got Francois, Blitz Comet, V-Tron, the Jersey kid,

39
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,850
你知道我们超屌 然后我们有毁灭女
on the beats. You know we rock. Then Demel-Ishun,

40
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,350
说唱界最牛的妞
the dopest girl on the mic.

41
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,190
还有狗A我 我吠叫事实 我的段子既严密又优质
And Alpha-Dog, I bark the truth, my verses be all nice and tight.

42
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,360
所以你知道我们是谁了
So now you know who were are.

43
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,920
帮派帮是比星星还闪亮的帮派
CrewCrew is the crew shining brighter than a quazar.

44
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,940
但是你这个灾难
But your bizarre.

45
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,470
是 就是你 就是个废物
Yes, you sir, are a loser.

46
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,500
所以盖好你的疯圆头带着诗滚回家
So cover up that freakish dome and head back home and take your poems.

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,370
嘿 你们 别这样
Oh, dude, come on!

48
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,980
帕布 你还好吗
Pops, are you ok?

49
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,860
尽管我很欣赏他们作诗技巧 但是我不是废物
While I appreciate their poetic skills, I am not a loser.

50
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,250
你对我来说就是个衰人
You look like a loser to me.

51
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,350
是啊 
Yeah, why don't you take gramps back home before he starts crying some more?

52
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,050
Loser.

53
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,940
- C'mon, Pops, let's go. - No!

54
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,820
I'll have you know my verses won many a competition!

55
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,150
You don't believe me?

56
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,480
I challenge you to a competition tonight!

57
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,560
You mean a rap battle?

58
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,260
If that's what you're calling it, then yes.

59
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,830
Alright, grandpops.

60
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,160
Crew-Crew never backs down! So it's on.

61
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,030
- You're going down! - You're gonna get yours, buddy!

62
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,240
Alright Pops, we can't let you do this by yourself.

63
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,160
Yeah, those guys are gonna walk all over you!

64
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,810
Plus, we know way more stuff about this than you do.

65
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,120
So Rigby and I will rap with you in the battle.

66
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,260
Really!? Our own crew, good show!

67
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,120
Alright Pops, here's how you battle.

68
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,540
Rigby, show him.

69
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,760
Hey Mordecry, oh I mean Mordecai,

70
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,760
didn't mean to diss you please don't run away and hide,

71
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,040
saw you sobbing at that movie 'A Very Happy Bride',

72
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,680
here I'll pass you a tissue, try to have some male pride!

73
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,080
See Pops, it's easy!

74
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,390
'coz the ladies don't like your sensitive side,

75
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,970
like Margaret for example but I guess it's just implied!

76
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:33,960
Okay, dude.

77
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,130
She won't get with you, she just won't get with you,

78
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,560
not gonna get with you, never gonna get with you-

79
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,880
- Okay, we get it! - I'm just keeping it real.

80
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,410
Now you try Pops.

81
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,480
But he's just making fun of you!

82
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,580
Exactly! That's what you gotta do!

83
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,740
Now give it a shot.

84
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,270
No, I won't do it!

85
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,360
What!? C'mon, you said you wanted to win!

86
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,890
Being negative and hurting someone's feelings

87
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,160
is no way to win a competition!

88
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,360
The power of poetry lies in expressing the beauty of everything around you!

89
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,030
- What? - You're not making any sense.

90
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,520
Come, I'll show you!

91
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,220
What is this place, this magical field,

92
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,940
it's wide and it's open, nothing's concealed.

93
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,820
It's sceneic and peaceful for us to enjoy,

94
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,920
why this is the park, good show old boy!

95
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,920
Hmhm, not bad!

96
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,780
Yeah!

97
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,480
A place of great beauty for plenty to use,

98
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,470
it inspires us all so go spread the news,

99
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,400
to man woman and child or begging cowboy,

100
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,900
this is the park, good show old boy!

101
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,570
Where's this stuff coming from?

102
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,100
Man, he's getting into it!

103
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,400
The key to this place puts a smile on your face,

104
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,980
it is the people it does employ!

105
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,710
Why this is the park, good show old boy!

106
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,080
Yo, is he for real with that?

107
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,880
Good show old boy?

108
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,310
You're gonna have to do better than that if you wanna beat us tonight.

109
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,660
You big headed loser.

110
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,230
Hmph, go ahead and make snide remarks.

111
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,730
Me and my crew are taping into the power of poetry,

112
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:12,680
and the beauty of our verses will be sure to knock your socks off.

113
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,770
See you fools tonight,

114
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,520
unless you too afraid to show up.

115
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,950
We'll be there.

116
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,760
Lo-ser.

117
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,260
Their rhymes are clever,

118
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,590
but they don't come from the heart.

119
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,220
As long as we're true to ourselves we can't lose.

120
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,640
Oh look, ice-cream truck!

121
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,890
Dude, this is not good!

122
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,540
We gotta find a way to back out of the battle.

123
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,590
Yeah man, I'm totally with you, those guys are gonna destroy us!

124
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,460
Mordecai and Rigby, look! I have a surprise for you.

125
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,540
Tah-dah! I made matching uniforms for tonight!

126
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,840
Pops, we can't do this.

127
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,060
What do you mean?

128
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,830
Look, we're gonna lose!

129
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,940
No, the power of poetry will d-

130
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,300
Pops, the power of poetry isn't even a thing!

131
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,180
C'mon, Pops, this is dumb.

132
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,470
We should just back out.

133
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,450
Well I don't have that option.

134
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,100
Those gentleman called me a loser and I must set them straight.

135
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,440
Yeah, but what if they're right? Uh, I mean-

136
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,120
Fine, I'll do it your way.

137
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,910
I'll do it your way!

138
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,320
Wait, Pops, that's not what we meant!

139
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,030
Shoot.

140
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,220
Man, I feel kinda bad.

141
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,460
I know, but Pops just doesn't get it!

142
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,780
I mean Skips, you're not all into classical poetry, right?

143
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,590
Eh, haikus, mostly.

144
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,730
Seriously?

145
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,770
Okay, but what're we supposed to do?

146
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,010
If we dess up like idiots and go down to recite poetry against that crew,

147
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,250
we'll be humiliated!

148
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,930
Yeah, losers for life!

149
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,840
I've lost my appetite.

150
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,490
Mordecai, Rigby.

151
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,810
Friends don't let down other friends.

152
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,570
You guys are losers.

153
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,400
He's right.

154
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
Man, poetry's powerful stuff.

155
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,980
Your attitude is unappealing,

156
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,120
some would say quite rude.

157
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,090
Your shoes are colorful-

158
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,840
no!

159
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,920
C'mon tough guy, why are you tongue tied?

160
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,260
Watch out everybody looks like grandpa's about to cry!

161
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,440
Whether in righteous storms or the rainiest of days-

162
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,320
Poetry!?

163
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,450
-friends stick with friends through thick and thin always.

164
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,000
Mordecai, Rigby, you came!

165
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,530
We're sorry, Pops, we were acting like fools-

166
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,290
-we hope you can forgive us for being complete tools-

167
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,780
-your poems aren't lame, they're really works of art-

168
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,350
-if we gotta win this battle we gotta do it from the heart!

169
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,790
Oh, thank goodness!

170
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,270
Your way wasn't working at all!

171
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,030
So what up?

172
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,970
Are will battlin' or have y'all smartened up?

173
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,490
Let's do this!

174
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,660
Beauty's in the center of all that you see,

175
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,570
simple yet complex and fully textured.

176
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,450
And beauty be apart of all that you be,

177
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,640
because you are the best rhymers that I've ever heard!

178
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,400
That's pretty cool!

179
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,620
Aww yeah, they're into it!

180
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,690
Aw what!? Uh uh, this is real now.

181
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,310
Why you talking 'bout beauty, man,

182
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,320
don't understand what's that got to do with you, you fool.

183
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,160
You guys are like spoiled hams in a can-super bland,

184
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,910
expiration date's overdue!

185
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,110
The canning of meat is quite a sweet treat,

186
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,030
so thanks for comparing us so.

187
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,390
Your words are inspiring, my dear so concrete,

188
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,660
you really put on quite a show!

189
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,220
Okay, hold up,

190
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,790
you wanna talk words and verse,

191
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,300
but your face is distracting, so ugly it bugs me,

192
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,790
take care of that mess and sweep it under the rug please,

193
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,360
so trust me, you're only taking matters from bad to worse,

194
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,020
so the only solution is to turn around in reverse.

195
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,160
A gift to us, a new perspective on things,

196
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,830
life looking different from where you stand true?

197
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,280
So much to discover so spread your wings

198
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,400
and take flight for a birds eye view!

199
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,990
Okay, things be getting serious,

200
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,760
you guys are delirious, are you hearing this?

201
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,410
Talkin' 'bout positive things, but you ain't got no game,

202
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,470
and it's plain to see, you're strange to me

203
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,420
'coz we be shining like diamonds,

204
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,420
y'all be petty cash, nice mustache-

205
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,200
-conquistador's been wanting it back,

206
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,060
in fact what are you, a rat-a squirrel-

207
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,100
-some kinda fat meerkat who thinks he's rad-

208
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,010
-and look at that-

209
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,110
-your bird friend's dropping words absurd again,

210
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,550
you spit a rhyme that exposes the nerd in him,

211
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,930
if you think Alpha Dog is gonna lie down and let you win,

212
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,500
your head be all inflated I guess just like a giant blimp.

213
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,810
Okay Pops, you got this!

214
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,610
Yeah, you can finish him off!

215
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,940
It's been some time since I've felt this way,

216
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,130
challenged by such worthy opponents.

217
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,640
Your rhyme scheme is good but you're missing a few components.

218
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,020
You may say things that are hurt or some things that will sting,

219
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,810
but for you it's all just posturing.

220
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,660
Look inside and be true to some real feelings

221
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,100
and the world will be yours I'm assuring you.

222
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,240
So I thank you good sirs for this great contest-

223
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,290
-it's certainly been lots of fun,

224
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,130
但是你们说什么都不能打败我
but there's nothing you can say to put me to rest,

225
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,260
所以真的 我已经赢了
so really, I've already won.

226
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,290
我们做到了 我们赢了
We did it, we won!

227
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,900
我们不是废物
We're not losers!

228
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,470
这真是令人兴奋
My, that was exhilarating!

229
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,350
谢谢你们支持我
Thank you for standing by me,

230
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,450
诗歌的力量在友谊面前不算什么
the power of poetry is nothing compared to the power of friendship!

231
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,720
没问题帕布
No problem Pops.

232
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,010
我只是很高兴没有人再叫我们废物了
I'm just glad no-one can call us losers now.

233
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,300
废物们 你们哪里拿的戏服
Hey losers, where'd you get those outfits?

234
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,010
我妈的衣柜
My mom's closet?

235
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,120
我们最好去换一下衣服
We should probably go change clothes.

236
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,120
