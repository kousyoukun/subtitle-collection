00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,251
Enjoy the sweet
taste of my lazor beam!

3
00:00:46,253 --> 00:00:50,297
No, not the lazor beam.
Engage force field!

4
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:51,214
PJ.

5
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:52,884
Put your seat
belt on, young lady.

6
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,010
No. It's uncomfortable.

7
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:57,095
Samantha Pepper
I will not ask you again.

8
00:00:57,097 --> 00:00:59,056
Sam, now.

9
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:02,561
Okay, fine.

10
00:01:07,983 --> 00:01:09,317
Mom!

11
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,965
Open your textbook, please.

12
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,299
Hopefully, we can do better
on the next test.

13
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:19,429
Electricity was considered
nothing but a dangerous idea

14
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,431
or fad when Edison
was born in...

15
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,560
Anyone?

16
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,351
Ms. Pepper?

17
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,768
1847.

18
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,603
We can't hear you, Smalls.

19
00:02:28,605 --> 00:02:30,231
1847.

20
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,275
But, by 1931,

21
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:34,943
the time of Edison's death,

22
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:37,032
cities were powered
by electricity.

23
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:44,370
PJ... no gum, please.

24
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,705
However, still today,
many do not understand

25
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:48,916
not only the basics
of electricity,

26
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,251
- but the potential of its power.
- Pathetic.

27
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:54,088
Electricity can
be made from water, wind,

28
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,465
the sun,
and even animal poop.

29
00:02:57,634 --> 00:02:59,427
Okay. The homework assignment

30
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,970
is written at the end
of the chapter

31
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,596
in your textbook.

32
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:04,306
Trish, that sounds
like so much fun.

33
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:06,017
We'll invite everyone.

34
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,393
Well, at least those
who've hit puberty.

35
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,066
Great.

36
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:49,268
Hey.

37
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,560
Hey. Uh, where's Dad?

38
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:52,354
Oh, he's busy
with the sink again.

39
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:54,941
How was school?

40
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,069
Fine.

41
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,614
You sure?

42
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:03,699
Yeah.

43
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,440
Hey, Dad.

44
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,899
Hey! Can you give me a hand?

45
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,067
Sure.

46
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,651
- Hi, babe.
- Hey.

47
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:41,945
Can I talk to you
for a second?

48
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:44,240
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

49
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,824
- You got this?
- Already on it.

50
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:47,286
- All right.
- Okay.

51
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,250
Hey, sweetie.
What's goin' on?

52
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,584
I don't think you
had a chance to notice,

53
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:59,421
but she has gum in her hair...
again.

54
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:01,258
I think she's being bullied
at school.

55
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,385
I think you need
to talk to her.

56
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:07,262
Okay, okay.
I'm on it.

57
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:08,389
- Okay.
- All right.

58
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,598
All right.

59
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,724
I gotta go back.

60
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:11,851
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

61
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:12,685
- Bye.
- Bye.

62
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,519
See you.

63
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,562
- Bye, Sam!
- Bye!

64
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:17,106
All right.

65
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,401
How we doin' here?

66
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,112
Hey, um...

67
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:24,529
How was, um...
How was school today?

68
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:25,572
Fine.

69
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:26,949
Channellock.

70
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,286
Gotcha.

71
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,204
Channellock.

72
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:33,498
Just, um...
Just fine?

73
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,625
Yep.

74
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,461
Okay.

75
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,003
Hey, what are you feelin'
for dinner tonight?

76
00:05:46,887 --> 00:05:49,389
Whoa! Whoa there!

77
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,432
I'm gonna have to give you
the Heimlich.

78
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,933
What's the matter
with you?

79
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,478
That was pretty great of Sydney
to pick you up today.

80
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,147
- Right? I mean...
- Yeah.

81
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,983
That, uh-that sink took me
a lot longer than I expected.

82
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,651
Oh.

83
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,610
I helped. Right?

84
00:06:03,612 --> 00:06:04,654
Mm-hmm.

85
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,120
You like her.
Don't you?

86
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,248
Sydney?

87
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,832
Yes, Dad.

88
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,548
She's practically
part of the family.

89
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,759
What are you doing?

90
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,263
Nothing. What do you mean
what am I doing?

91
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,432
You always do this.

92
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,685
Do what?

93
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,939
Eat your veggies.

94
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,110
Well, you eat yours first.

95
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,529
On three.

96
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,865
One...

97
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,117
- Two...
- Three.

98
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:52,534
Mmh!

99
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:54,579
So good.
Back to spaghetti.

100
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,999
- That was a bad piece.

101
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,957
That was for water.

102
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,459
I was thinking we could all
go out to-

103
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,752
to eat, tomorrow night.

104
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,839
You know, the three of us.

105
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,466
Okay.

106
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,802
To our spot.

107
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,682
Our spot?

108
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,561
But we haven't been there
since Mom.

109
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,728
Well...

110
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,688
We haven't been to
a lot of places since Mom,

111
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,649
Sam, but...

112
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,276
...you can't avoid every
little place in this town

113
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,654
that reminds us of her.
You know?

114
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:32,574
We-we have to allow ourselves
to go out and...

115
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:34,368
...make new memories.

116
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,454
You're always trying to do that.

117
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,164
Excuse me?

118
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:42,584
You're always trying
to make new memories.

119
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:43,586
Samantha.

120
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:44,631
I'm full.

121
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:52,553
Sam.

122
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,596
Sam, sit down.

123
00:08:07,903 --> 00:08:09,486
Hey, sweetie.

124
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:10,697
Hey.

125
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:11,533
It's bed time.

126
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,923
You're my little girl.

127
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,798
Dad...

128
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,093
But you are.

129
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,679
I can't wait
for dinner tomorrow.

130
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,472
It's gonna be great.
It's gonna be...

131
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,681
...really good for you.

132
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,851
We're gonna have fun.

133
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:43,188
I love you.

134
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,730
Love you, too.

135
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,648
Well, you know, I...

136
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,733
...have to eat your face.

137
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,028
Okay.

138
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,448
Okay, good night.

139
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,449
- Good night.
- See you tomorrow.

140
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,033
See ya.

141
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,068
It could be anything.
It could be anything at...

142
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,611
Hey, Sam.

143
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:35,238
Hey.

144
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,657
Again?

145
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:38,825
It looks like
you have too many

146
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:40,454
different screw types
going on.

147
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,580
Hmm, I dunno.

148
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:44,623
It looks to me like
it might be

149
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,624
how I mounted my sensor.

150
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,167
Everyone!

151
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,837
Can I have your attention,
please?

152
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,921
Thank you.

153
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,839
Okay, so Trish's birthday
is this weekend

154
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:55,509
and we're having
a girls only birthday party.

155
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,511
Sorry, boys.

156
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,054
We haves stacks
of invitations here

157
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,682
for those we're inviting.

158
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,724
Aw, Smalls, don't leave.

159
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:04,352
You might miss your name.

160
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:19,088
My mother
gave this to me when I was your age.

161
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,464
She gave it to me
as a reminder

162
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,050
that no matter what,

163
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:26,387
she will always be here
to protect and guide me.

164
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,263
I'm always here.

165
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,442
Hey, Sammy, let's go!
We're gonna be late!

166
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:07,469
Thank you.

167
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,014
Thanks.

168
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,932
Hey, now.

169
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,017
Ew.

170
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,227
Hey, now.

171
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:15,978
- Hey, now.
- Hey, now.

172
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:18,982
So, what do you think?

173
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,233
I like it, you guys.

174
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,484
I really do.

175
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,113
And I thought you only like
it because of the name.

176
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,238
- Well...
- Still...

177
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,116
- Yep.
- Still kind of a big part of it.

178
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,157
Oh, yeah?

179
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,160
- Yeah.
- Yes.

180
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:31,618
Yeah.

181
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,954
I think I like hers
the most.

182
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,122
Yeah, um...

183
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,289
- Let me just...
- Hey!

184
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,331
[Aw...

185
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,959
So, I got you something.

186
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,129
Just a little something.

187
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:40,879
A random thing.

188
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,131
There you go.

189
00:14:58,023 --> 00:14:59,479
If you don't like it,
we can take it back.

190
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,857
No big deal.

191
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,776
It's just that Jim said
it was one of the rarest ones.

192
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,611
No, no...

193
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,532
I really like this.

194
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,825
You do?

195
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,075
Yeah.

196
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,078
Nice.

197
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,541
Not now.
Can't read it now.

198
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:19,959
After dinner.
Come on.

199
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:20,877
Eat.

200
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,504
Food just got here.
Eat.

201
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,466
Fine.

202
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,300
Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey!

203
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,472
Slow your roll!
You forgetting something?

204
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:33,975
- Good night.
- Good night.

205
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,184
Good night, good night,
good night!

206
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,060
Mm!

207
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,686
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

208
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:40,897
And?

209
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,232
Thanks, Sydney! Night!

210
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,650
Good night.

211
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:07,714
"Get your very
own Mail-Order Monster.

212
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,593
Don't be the schmuck
who's pushed around.

213
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,805
Don't be the wallflower
in the crowd.

214
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,723
Frighten your enemies

215
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,432
and amuse your friends.

216
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,142
Send this ad with $20

217
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:23,605
to Merlin's Emporium
of Monsters and Magic."

218
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,739
Okay, so...
Oh, Samantha!

219
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,368
Just in time. Come on in.
Take your seat.

220
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,036
Mommy forget to drive you?

221
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,787
Oh, wait...

222
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,083
That's... No.
All right. All right.

223
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,834
We are
collecting homework today.

224
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,421
Tommy, would you please collect
the homework assignments?

225
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,756
The rest of you,
please turn

226
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,090
to page 34 in your books.

227
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,844
We're on a new chapter today.

228
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,642
Samantha!

229
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,101
Samantha!

230
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,729
Hi, Mr. Thomas.

231
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,148
Hello, Samantha.

232
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,565
How are you?

233
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,650
Fine.

234
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,235
Good, good.

235
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,444
Um...

236
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,780
How do I put this?

237
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,949
A few of the teachers were...

238
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,867
...in the lunch room yesterday,

239
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,952
and saw what happened
with the whole...

240
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,205
...PJ thing.

241
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:24,292
Now, we know it
should've never happened,

242
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,626
and PJ knows that now.

243
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,299
So, I just want you to know

244
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,844
that we spoke
to Trish's parents, and...

245
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,013
Here you go.

246
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:38,892
You're welcome to go.

247
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,437
Okay, good.

248
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,981
Little shrimp got
Mr. Thomas to feel bad for her.

249
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,485
Didn't she?

250
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:50,985
If I were you,

251
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,944
and I'm really glad I'm not,

252
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:53,946
I wouldn't come.

253
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:54,908
There's a height requirement.

254
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,159
Well, at least from down here,
I can see how stuck up

255
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:01,247
you and your...
fake friends really are.

256
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,043
You think you're so
much better and smarter

257
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,210
than everyone else,
don't you?

258
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,380
Well, news flash,
you're not.

259
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:12,297
Just go back to your
stupid little comic books

260
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,175
and superheroes.

261
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,303
Wasn't that long ago
you used to dress up like them.

262
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,930
In fact, I still have
your Superman costume.

263
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,771
Wasn't that long ago

264
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,315
you killed your mom.

265
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,482
Hey.

266
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,816
I'm gonna go get ready
for bed.

267
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,362
- Oh.
- You sure you don't wanna come play?

268
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:58,488
Sydney could use your help.

269
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,405
She said she's good at cards
and she's horrible.

270
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,866
I'm horrible!

271
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,451
No. I'm okay.

272
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,454
Okay. Hey!

273
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:07,330
How's the comic?

274
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,124
It's... one of a kind.

275
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,418
Good. All right.

276
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,670
I'll, uh-
I'll ask Jim

277
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:15,882
to give me a call the next
time he gets a new one in.

278
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,049
Baby steps.

279
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,427
I think I did good.

280
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,515
You ready?
You're going down.

281
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:26,391
Not at cards.

282
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,043
Hey.

283
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:56,421
What are you doing?

284
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,755
Well, Sam,
you know what I'm doing.

285
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,423
We've talked about this.

286
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,717
I mean, there's so
many pictures.

287
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:03,135
It's... There's...
We can't have all of these up.

288
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,594
You know?

289
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,973
It's not fair.

290
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,018
To who?

291
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,810
Sydney?

292
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,769
I'm sorry my mom
makes her uncomfortable.

293
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:16,025
Sam! Sam, you know
that's not true.

294
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,133
Hey.

295
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,510
Have you seen a package
or something like that?

296
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,346
No. Why?
You expecting something?

297
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:49,391
Could you just tell me
if you do?

298
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,476
Yes, ma'am.

299
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:52,559
Thanks.

300
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,519
Hey, do you wanna, uh,
go to the movies

301
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,229
tonight with Sydney
and me?

302
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,565
Um... I can't.

303
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,567
I have...

304
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,111
...Science Club.

305
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,948
I found this.

306
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,163
School's been fine.

307
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:57,210
Well... not that fine.

308
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,381
My grades are still good.

309
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:05,634
It's-it's just, well...

310
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,221
You know.

311
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:18,603
I don't know if
Dad's told you yet, but...

312
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,400
...he met someone.

313
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:26,740
I guess it's...
been a while now.

314
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,993
She's nice. I just...

315
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,994
I don't know...

316
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:35,915
...why he's trying to...
move on.

317
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:45,424
We don't need anyone else.

318
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:47,885
We have you.

319
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,554
We'll always have you.

320
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:58,018
Hey, babe.

321
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,978
How was court?

322
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,479
Well, it's finally over.

323
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,523
That went significantly
longer than I expected.

324
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,566
Well, are we still on
for a movie tonight?

325
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,068
Yes, yes, I would love to.

326
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,902
Is Sam gonna make it?

327
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:07,944
Yeah, not tonight.

328
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,282
She's being held hostage
by Science Club.

329
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:13,325
Oh...

330
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,661
I don't remember her being
in Science Club.

331
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:09,800
Simple enough.

332
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:50,317
I can see why this
never took off.

333
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:52,735
Just add water.

334
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:54,778
All right. That's it.

335
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,407
I'm callin' it a night.

336
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,574
Okay.

337
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:00,826
Dress shirts come
out neat and professional.

338
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:01,744
Pants and slacks...

339
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:02,828
Good night.

340
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,330
Good night, sweetie.
I love you.

341
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:05,748
I'm just gonna...

342
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,917
...be here a little longer.

343
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,584
That's fine. Okay.

344
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,585
I'll see you
in the morning.

345
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,837
Okay.

346
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,632
...wrinkles inside
your dryer than Mister Steamy!

347
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,633
Forgot about that load
for hours?

348
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,177
That's a wrinkled mess!

349
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,805
No problem!
Simple toss in Mister Steamy,

350
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:22,849
and, in minutes, your clothes
are ready to wear!

351
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,545
Bye-bye, Bigfoot.

352
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:13,042
Ew!

353
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:18,672
- Wah wah!
- ...everywhere!

354
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:27,267
Sammy!

355
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:30,769
Dad?

356
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:33,478
What are-what are you
doing here?

357
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,023
I'm pickin' you up.

358
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:36,274
I rode my bike.

359
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:38,234
Well, no biggy.
We'll throw it in the back.

360
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:39,861
C'mon. I got something
really special planned

361
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:43,030
for you and Sydney tonight,
so we gotta go get ready.

362
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:44,407
What are you talking about?

363
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:46,745
Dad, I can't. I...

364
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,661
What do you mean?
What do you mean you can't?

365
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:50,997
We'll throw your bike
in the back.

366
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:52,748
Come on. I obviously have to shower.
Let's go.

367
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,752
Dad, I-I can't go.
I have...

368
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,128
...detention.

369
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,130
Since when do you
have detention?

370
00:29:59,132 --> 00:29:59,963
Since now.

371
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,007
So I can't go tonight.
Sorry.

372
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,051
Well, hey.
We will, uh...

373
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:04,259
We'll pick you up
after detention.

374
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:05,886
Dad, I don't wanna go.

375
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,028
When was the last
time that Sam got detention?

376
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,198
Something's going on with her.

377
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,867
I feel it.
You know?

378
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:30,121
And I think you do too.

379
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,126
You know, that's one of the
things I love about you the most.

380
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:39,128
What's that?

381
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:42,509
You're not afraid
to call me out.

382
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:46,302
Sydney, you are the...

383
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:47,761
...most intelligent,

384
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:50,432
intuitive, caring woman...

385
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:57,063
We don't really fit in here.
We're... different.

386
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:59,065
I like that,
and I wouldn't anyone

387
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:00,732
to come into our life
and change that.

388
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,526
You're exactly what she needs,

389
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:04,364
and exactly what I need.

390
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:08,410
When Wendy died...

391
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,827
I never imagined
that I would...

392
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:14,415
...share my life
with anyone else.

393
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,792
Especially with Sam.

394
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:20,585
When I see you with Sam,

395
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,171
it gives me hope.

396
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:24,467
And I thought
all hope was lost.

397
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:32,974
Would you marry me?

398
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:36,268
Yes.

399
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:41,982
Wow, detention
runs late these days.

400
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:44,570
Yeah, sorry!
Be right there!

401
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:51,825
Hey.

402
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,494
You make dinner?

403
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:55,496
No, you-you missed it.
Remember?

404
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:57,498
Sydney and I
went to Salt & Pepper.

405
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,208
Wow.

406
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,084
There again?

407
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:19,646
You know, I'm really disappointed
that you couldn't be there.

408
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,230
Well...

409
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,940
Okay...

410
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,526
I mean, we were just there
the other night.

411
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,287
What was that for?

412
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:37,539
Samantha...

413
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,165
Okay, Dad, I'm sorry

414
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,292
I was...

415
00:32:41,294 --> 00:32:43,544
...rude to you earlier today,
and I...

416
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:45,298
...promise it won't
happen again.

417
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:50,301
Keep watching.

418
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:00,061
Okay...

419
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,478
Now I'm confused.

420
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,023
Sam, I need to talk to you.

421
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:05,525
Okay.

422
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:13,783
I, um...

423
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:16,369
I know it's been hard,
you know,

424
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:18,578
really hard,

425
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,498
these past few years,
just having me.

426
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,709
I-I like just having you.

427
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:24,919
Okay, yeah.

428
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:26,336
But as you get older,
you know,

429
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:29,215
you're gonna wanna have,
um...

430
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:31,133
...another female,
a woman,

431
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:32,301
in-in your life.

432
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:33,928
You know, someone that you
can talk to,

433
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,680
and trust and rely on.

434
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:38,684
But, I have-
I have you.

435
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:43,148
Sam...

436
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,732
Okay. What are you saying?

437
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,902
I proposed.

438
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:54,157
To...?

439
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,575
I asked Sydney to marry me.

440
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:10,548
Sam...

441
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,718
Sam...

442
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,427
Sammy.

443
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:25,188
No, no, no, no.
This isn't real.

444
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,438
Hey, what are you doing?

445
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,648
Come on, now.
Don't be like that.

446
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,150
How could you do this
to me?

447
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,360
Because I'm your father,

448
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:33,362
and, Sammy, I know
you're a really smart girl,

449
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:34,738
but believe it or not,

450
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,074
I know what's best for you.

451
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:37,200
You know what'd be best
for me?!

452
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:38,242
Having my mom back!

453
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:40,119
Well, she is gone!

454
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:46,333
No! Get out!

455
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:47,293
Get out!

456
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:50,338
Get out! I hate you!

457
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:17,532
I asked Sydney to marry me.

458
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:52,459
Hello?

459
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:56,298
Hello.

460
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,927
Wow.

461
00:37:00,512 --> 00:37:02,263
Wow.

462
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:16,400
Wake up! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

463
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:27,494
I'm Sam.

464
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:29,415
Sam...

465
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:32,083
What's your name?

466
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:43,552
MOM.

467
00:37:43,554 --> 00:37:45,762
MOM.

468
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:46,974
MOM.

469
00:37:57,443 --> 00:37:59,276
That's a hammer.

470
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:03,155
You use it to smash things.

471
00:38:03,157 --> 00:38:05,950
Hammer.

472
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:09,162
A lot of things.

473
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:21,382
Ha!

474
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:23,219
Interesting.

475
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,314
Whoa! No, no, no, no, no!

476
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:38,398
You can't go out there.

477
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,485
At least, not yet.

478
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:41,526
It's not safe.

479
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:08,431
Crap.

480
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:14,017
Did you sleep in there
last night?

481
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:17,938
I did.

482
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,315
Well, what are you...

483
00:39:19,317 --> 00:39:20,650
You can't go in there.

484
00:39:20,652 --> 00:39:21,985
What are you doing in there?

485
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:25,320
Science project.

486
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:26,947
I made a big mess in there,
so...

487
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:28,115
...I'm gonna clean it up.

488
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:29,534
Okay. I'll help you.

489
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,744
No, no, no, no, no.

490
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:36,331
It's okay.
Got it.

491
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:37,918
Okay, well, look, Sam...

492
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,380
We need to talk.

493
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:43,550
I don't think we do.

494
00:39:46,844 --> 00:39:48,012
Okay.

495
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:50,640
Okay, well...

496
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,434
I will see you after school.

497
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:07,697
Okay, so, here's the thing.

498
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:08,905
I need to go to school,

499
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,700
so you need to stay here.

500
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:12,367
School.

501
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:13,744
I need to go to school.

502
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:17,706
MOM go school.

503
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:20,377
No, no, MOM.
You can't go to school.

504
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:41,688
Come on.

505
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,648
Come on. This way.

506
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:58,500
Okay.

507
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:02,211
Do not... leave this room.

508
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,213
Okay.

509
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:07,715
Now, if someone come in here,

510
00:41:07,717 --> 00:41:09,135
what are you going to do?

511
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,858
Yes. Good.

512
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:27,526
Okay.

513
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:30,320
So...

514
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:36,119
These usually
keep me pretty occupied.

515
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:38,579
Feel free to look through them.

516
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:40,248
I'll be back later.

517
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:54,931
Thanks.

518
00:42:06,192 --> 00:42:07,316
What have I done?

519
00:42:45,356 --> 00:42:47,900
So, was it you?

520
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:52,737
What are you talking about?

521
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:54,655
The monster in PJ's locker.

522
00:42:54,657 --> 00:43:01,579
I still can't believe
Gigantor peed herself.

523
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:02,957
No, it wasn't me.

524
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:26,439
Sorry!

525
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:49,753
It's okay.
It's just me.

526
00:43:50,672 --> 00:43:52,173
Sam!

527
00:43:53,007 --> 00:43:54,923
We gotta get out of here.

528
00:43:54,925 --> 00:43:56,135
That was a close one.

529
00:44:02,224 --> 00:44:04,518
You're creating a
little whirlpool there.

530
00:44:05,728 --> 00:44:06,978
Hmm. Yeah.

531
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,938
Sorry.

532
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,356
You okay?

533
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:11,566
Yeah, yeah.

534
00:44:11,568 --> 00:44:12,900
It's, uh...

535
00:44:12,902 --> 00:44:13,820
Everything's great.

536
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:17,490
What aren't you telling me?

537
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:21,992
Uh, well...

538
00:44:21,994 --> 00:44:25,829
Sam didn't take to the proposal
as well as I'd hoped.

539
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:27,041
She isn't ready.

540
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:29,208
It's too soon for her?

541
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:30,376
No, no, no, no, no, no.

542
00:44:30,378 --> 00:44:32,586
She's fine.
It's just, uh...

543
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:33,838
...she doesn't understand, yet.

544
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:39,135
You know,

545
00:44:39,137 --> 00:44:41,262
we've never really had
any one-on-one time,

546
00:44:41,264 --> 00:44:42,682
just the two of us.

547
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:45,932
What if we just had,
like, a girls' day?

548
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:47,436
Think she'd be open to that?

549
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:49,936
Yeah, yeah.

550
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:50,940
Yeah?

551
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:52,856
I mean...

552
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:54,652
- It's worth a try.
- Yeah.

553
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:27,101
Mmh!

554
00:45:38,028 --> 00:45:38,862
MOM?

555
00:45:45,036 --> 00:45:46,579
Who?

556
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:48,580
Where'd you find that?

557
00:45:54,336 --> 00:46:07,097
Wendy.

558
00:46:25,242 --> 00:46:29,537
Hey, MOM...

559
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:49,932
This is awesome.

560
00:46:49,934 --> 00:46:51,851
All right.
We're almost done.

561
00:46:51,853 --> 00:46:53,101
We just have
one more room left.

562
00:46:53,103 --> 00:46:54,644
Come with me.

563
00:47:06,034 --> 00:47:08,159
I have a feeling you're gonna
have some fun in here.

564
00:47:18,045 --> 00:47:19,755
These are my action figures.

565
00:47:21,007 --> 00:47:23,092
They're similar to the ones
you saw in the comic book.

566
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:31,476
Let's just...

567
00:47:32,601 --> 00:47:35,394
And here is a...

568
00:47:35,396 --> 00:47:37,315
...robot prototype
I've been working on.

569
00:47:38,233 --> 00:47:40,191
It's not finished yet.

570
00:47:40,193 --> 00:47:41,650
It still has
a few holes in it.

571
00:47:41,652 --> 00:47:43,362
Hey, no! Hey!

572
00:47:44,197 --> 00:47:45,362
Don't touch that.

573
00:47:48,034 --> 00:47:49,577
Okay.

574
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:52,619
Oh, actually...

575
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:02,588
It was that
out of place, huh?

576
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:04,134
Yes.

577
00:48:06,177 --> 00:48:09,302
What... is...?

578
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:10,847
Just a stupid invitation

579
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:12,892
from a couple of mean girls.

580
00:48:14,018 --> 00:48:16,019
Bad?

581
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:16,978
Yes.

582
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,688
These girls...

583
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:21,275
...well, one in particular,
PJ is bad.

584
00:48:24,195 --> 00:48:27,988
Pee Jay bad?

585
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:29,824
Yeah.

586
00:48:29,826 --> 00:48:31,244
Which I always think is weird.

587
00:48:33,538 --> 00:48:34,831
We used to be friends.

588
00:48:35,539 --> 00:48:37,831
Friends.

589
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:38,917
Yeah.

590
00:48:40,336 --> 00:48:42,003
Like me and you.

591
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:43,173
We're friends.

592
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:50,137
You want to go outside again?

593
00:48:56,353 --> 00:48:58,394
We can't. I'm sorry.

594
00:48:58,396 --> 00:49:00,106
It's too risky.

595
00:49:02,275 --> 00:49:03,608
We gotta get you
out of here.

596
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:05,278
Dad's gonna be home
any second.

597
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,905
Sam, you home?

598
00:49:08,907 --> 00:49:10,492
Yeah, Dad.
Be right there!

599
00:49:21,795 --> 00:49:23,251
Step on there.

600
00:49:23,253 --> 00:49:24,336
Come up here.

601
00:49:26,257 --> 00:49:29,050
Gotcha. Come on.

602
00:49:29,052 --> 00:49:30,804
Stay here.

603
00:49:33,514 --> 00:49:36,475
Oh, and don't leave
or make too much noise.

604
00:49:38,644 --> 00:49:40,269
- Hey.
- Dad!

605
00:49:40,271 --> 00:49:43,271
You talking to someone?

606
00:49:43,273 --> 00:49:45,108
Yes... Well...

607
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,983
Myself.
I was talking to myself.

608
00:49:46,985 --> 00:49:48,318
What are you doing?

609
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,780
Well, I was looking for you.

610
00:49:50,197 --> 00:49:51,238
Why?

611
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,951
Why-why is that?
What do you need?

612
00:49:53,952 --> 00:49:55,284
Okay. Because...

613
00:49:55,286 --> 00:49:56,744
Listen.

614
00:49:56,746 --> 00:49:58,996
Sydney wants
to take you out tomorrow.

615
00:49:58,998 --> 00:50:01,001
Sydney.

616
00:50:02,376 --> 00:50:04,043
- I'm okay.
- No, listen. Sam, Sam...

617
00:50:04,045 --> 00:50:05,168
Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam...

618
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:07,838
Please. Please, just listen.
Okay?

619
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,673
It would mean so much to her.

620
00:50:09,675 --> 00:50:11,217
And to me, too.

621
00:50:11,219 --> 00:50:12,427
And, I mean,

622
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:13,677
I dunno,
maybe you'll surprise yourself

623
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:15,512
and end up having
a good time.

624
00:50:15,514 --> 00:50:17,639
You know what's best, right?

625
00:50:17,641 --> 00:50:18,893
Hey, Sam!

626
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:21,269
Come back over here, please.

627
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:25,442
Listen to me.

628
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,191
I'm really sorry

629
00:50:28,193 --> 00:50:32,612
about what I said last night.

630
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:33,866
I'm sorry, too.

631
00:50:35,117 --> 00:50:36,744
Come here.

632
00:50:39,998 --> 00:50:41,583
So, uh...

633
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:44,376
That means you'll go tomorrow?

634
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:48,170
Fine.

635
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,342
- Okay, okay.
- That's my girl!

636
00:50:52,344 --> 00:50:54,010
Thank you, thank you.

637
00:50:54,012 --> 00:50:55,427
- Okay.
- Thank you. I love you.

638
00:51:18,161 --> 00:51:22,329
Sam...

639
00:51:22,331 --> 00:51:24,917
Wendy...

640
00:51:27,753 --> 00:51:29,170
Dad...

641
00:52:07,293 --> 00:52:09,334
Sydney?

642
00:52:09,336 --> 00:52:10,713
Who?

643
00:52:11,965 --> 00:52:13,550
It's complicated.

644
00:52:14,675 --> 00:52:17,469
Sydney bad?

645
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:20,972
Well, I mean...

646
00:52:20,974 --> 00:52:23,057
She's not a bad person.

647
00:52:23,059 --> 00:52:24,269
It's just that...

648
00:52:25,394 --> 00:52:27,230
...she's really
changed my dad.

649
00:52:29,065 --> 00:52:30,983
He can't see it,
obviously.

650
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,943
He keeps saying that...

651
00:52:34,945 --> 00:52:36,487
...we should make new memories

652
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:40,407
and that she's gonna
be so good for me...

653
00:52:40,409 --> 00:52:41,786
...but she's not.

654
00:52:43,996 --> 00:52:45,704
I don't need new memories,

655
00:52:45,706 --> 00:52:49,374
or a new mom.

656
00:52:49,376 --> 00:52:50,668
MOM?

657
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,336
No, not you.

658
00:52:52,338 --> 00:52:53,882
My mother, Wendy.

659
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:07,644
This way.

660
00:53:19,282 --> 00:53:21,365
Wendy.

661
00:53:21,367 --> 00:53:23,536
Yes. This is Wendy.

662
00:53:26,498 --> 00:53:27,706
Wendy is...

663
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:30,751
...well, was my mother.

664
00:53:32,295 --> 00:53:34,503
All I have left of her now
are those pictures

665
00:53:34,505 --> 00:53:36,421
and memories.

666
00:53:36,423 --> 00:53:38,509
My dad just wants
to throw them all away.

667
00:53:41,346 --> 00:53:44,429
When I see those pictures of us

668
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:45,808
I feel like...

669
00:53:46,809 --> 00:53:49,519
...she's still here...

670
00:53:49,521 --> 00:53:50,647
...with us...

671
00:53:52,856 --> 00:53:54,067
...with me...

672
00:53:55,443 --> 00:53:58,028
...and I didn't cause her
to go away.

673
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,489
I just...

674
00:54:00,322 --> 00:54:02,155
...I don't know what
I'm going to do.

675
00:54:15,713 --> 00:54:18,880
Always here.

676
00:54:44,742 --> 00:54:46,034
Come on.

677
00:54:46,036 --> 00:54:47,744
We should be heading back now.

678
00:55:10,476 --> 00:55:11,560
This way.

679
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:35,043
PJ...

680
00:55:39,255 --> 00:55:41,088
PJ bad.

681
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:42,632
MOM, stop!

682
00:55:42,634 --> 00:55:44,592
What are you doing?
Stop!

683
00:55:44,594 --> 00:55:47,387
Come on! Come on!

684
00:55:47,389 --> 00:55:55,228
No.

685
00:56:10,286 --> 00:56:11,494
Now, MOM,

686
00:56:11,496 --> 00:56:14,664
you can't just
go running around like that.

687
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:16,126
You might get caught.

688
00:56:17,043 --> 00:56:19,671
PJ bad.

689
00:56:21,338 --> 00:56:24,673
Protect Sam.

690
00:56:26,677 --> 00:56:28,096
Thanks.

691
00:56:29,222 --> 00:56:30,807
I got your back, too.

692
00:56:32,516 --> 00:56:34,226
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

693
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:19,103
Roy, she's getting
too smart for her own good.

694
00:57:19,105 --> 00:57:21,188
That's my girl.

695
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:23,066
That's our girl.

696
00:57:52,012 --> 00:57:54,014
Hey, Sam, Sydney's here!

697
00:57:58,603 --> 00:57:59,854
Not today.

698
00:58:05,318 --> 00:58:06,400
Hey.

699
00:58:06,402 --> 00:58:07,485
Good morning.

700
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,485
Morning.

701
00:58:08,487 --> 00:58:10,570
Doughnut or fritter?

702
00:58:10,572 --> 00:58:11,738
But, we have an appointment
in 15 minutes,

703
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:13,451
so we gotta hurry.

704
00:58:15,744 --> 00:58:17,077
Appointment?

705
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:18,123
Yeah.

706
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,929
Hey! Try these on.

707
00:59:29,402 --> 00:59:32,155
Yep. You were in need
of some new clothes.

708
00:59:35,824 --> 00:59:36,784
Let's see.

709
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:42,704
Oh, my gosh.
You look amazing.

710
00:59:42,706 --> 00:59:44,331
Do you like it?

711
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:45,458
You look great.

712
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:46,333
Can I use the bathroom?

713
00:59:46,335 --> 00:59:47,461
Yeah!

714
01:00:35,969 --> 01:00:38,304
You know,
I'll be right back.

715
01:00:44,561 --> 01:00:45,854
Sam?

716
01:01:01,786 --> 01:01:02,996
Sam?!

717
01:01:26,561 --> 01:01:27,769
Hey.

718
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:31,104
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

719
01:01:31,106 --> 01:01:33,316
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

720
01:01:33,318 --> 01:01:34,858
I don't
know where she went.

721
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:36,445
We're gonna find her.

722
01:01:37,989 --> 01:01:39,237
We'll find her.

723
01:01:50,626 --> 01:01:53,378
She said she had
to go to the bathroom.

724
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:54,547
I don't know what happened.

725
01:02:03,972 --> 01:02:04,889
MOM, hurry up.

726
01:02:04,891 --> 01:02:06,766
Sam!

727
01:02:06,768 --> 01:02:08,851
Back to school?

728
01:02:08,853 --> 01:02:11,271
No, not school.
Come on. Follow me.

729
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:18,612
Come on.

730
01:02:25,911 --> 01:02:28,412
I pushed her too hard
with the clothes.

731
01:02:28,414 --> 01:02:29,748
This isn't your fault.

732
01:02:32,668 --> 01:02:35,753
Does she have any friends
whose parents we can call?

733
01:02:35,755 --> 01:02:36,878
I don't know.

734
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:44,929
Okay.

735
01:02:44,931 --> 01:02:46,849
I think it's time
to call the police.

736
01:02:56,608 --> 01:02:58,860
Where Sam go?

737
01:02:58,862 --> 01:03:14,458
Don't worry.
We're almost there.

738
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,586
We're here.

739
01:03:24,971 --> 01:03:26,972
- Roy.
- Sheriff, come on in.

740
01:03:34,105 --> 01:03:37,940
Go back home?

741
01:03:37,942 --> 01:03:39,566
No, we can't.

742
01:03:39,568 --> 01:03:41,818
That's a life I want
no part in.

743
01:03:43,114 --> 01:03:45,655
Sydney?

744
01:03:45,657 --> 01:03:48,992
Kind of.

745
01:03:48,994 --> 01:03:50,454
A stepmom...

746
01:03:51,246 --> 01:03:52,996
...bullies...

747
01:03:52,998 --> 01:03:54,416
...no friends...

748
01:03:55,751 --> 01:03:59,628
...a new life.

749
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:01,215
I don't want any more
part of that.

750
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,173
I don't need that

751
01:04:03,175 --> 01:04:06,552
now that I have you.

752
01:04:06,554 --> 01:04:08,095
We got each other's back.

753
01:04:08,097 --> 01:04:12,143
MOM protect Sam.

754
01:04:13,478 --> 01:04:14,646
Thanks.

755
01:04:15,688 --> 01:04:17,022
I'll protect you, too.

756
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,945
I bet my dad's freaking out
right now.

757
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:26,449
Dad bad?

758
01:04:28,034 --> 01:04:29,575
No.

759
01:04:29,577 --> 01:04:32,205
Well, I mean, yeah,
right now.

760
01:04:34,039 --> 01:04:35,958
I dunno.
It's complicated.

761
01:04:42,882 --> 01:04:43,965
Good night, MOM.

762
01:04:48,096 --> 01:04:51,181
Good... night.

763
01:05:19,753 --> 01:05:22,711
Sam?

764
01:05:22,713 --> 01:05:24,046
PJ?

765
01:05:28,094 --> 01:05:29,552
Hey, whoa, MOM!

766
01:05:29,554 --> 01:05:30,887
Stop, no, MOM!

767
01:05:30,889 --> 01:05:33,057
No, stop, stop!
Calm down!

768
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:40,604
PJ...

769
01:05:40,606 --> 01:05:42,398
...meet MOM.

770
01:05:52,202 --> 01:05:53,909
Shh. There's nothing
to be afraid of.

771
01:05:53,911 --> 01:05:55,244
MOM is friendly.

772
01:05:55,246 --> 01:05:56,831
She won't hurt you.

773
01:06:00,543 --> 01:06:01,544
Right?

774
01:06:06,215 --> 01:06:08,509
Hello.

775
01:06:09,885 --> 01:06:11,719
See? It's nice.

776
01:06:20,896 --> 01:06:22,188
Everything okay, Roy?

777
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:24,648
No, Sheriff,
everything is not okay.

778
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:27,275
I'm going crazy
over here. Okay?

779
01:06:27,277 --> 01:06:28,653
I can't just
sit here anymore.

780
01:06:28,655 --> 01:06:30,445
I need to be out there
looking for my daughter.

781
01:06:30,447 --> 01:06:31,405
I know it's hard.

782
01:06:31,407 --> 01:06:32,407
Roy, listen to me.

783
01:06:32,409 --> 01:06:35,075
You have to stay home.

784
01:06:35,077 --> 01:06:35,952
If it were my kid,

785
01:06:35,954 --> 01:06:37,286
I'd be wanting
to get out there, too.

786
01:06:37,288 --> 01:06:39,204
But Sam's most likely

787
01:06:39,206 --> 01:06:40,414
to call or come home

788
01:06:40,416 --> 01:06:42,583
in the next 48 hours,

789
01:06:42,585 --> 01:06:44,501
so someone needs to be there.

790
01:06:44,503 --> 01:06:46,086
I promise...

791
01:06:46,088 --> 01:06:47,630
...we'll find her.

792
01:06:47,632 --> 01:06:48,465
Okay.

793
01:06:49,092 --> 01:06:51,467
I... thank you.

794
01:06:53,972 --> 01:06:56,266
Sir, we got
another report about a 10-31.

795
01:06:58,268 --> 01:07:00,478
Roger. 10-31.
We're on our way.

796
01:07:01,646 --> 01:07:04,063
Another missing kid.

797
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:47,398
You're gonna look so good.

798
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,275
Ow!

799
01:07:50,402 --> 01:07:52,154
Looks like someone
made a new friend.

800
01:07:53,405 --> 01:07:56,159
PJ friend.

801
01:07:57,202 --> 01:07:59,746
Glad we could set aside
our differences, MOM.

802
01:08:02,164 --> 01:08:03,956
Did you name it that
because of...

803
01:08:03,958 --> 01:08:05,583
No.

804
01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:08,086
It was the name
that was on the box.

805
01:08:08,088 --> 01:08:09,586
It's a Mail-Order Monster.

806
01:08:09,588 --> 01:08:12,548
Pretty lucky you found
that comic book, huh?

807
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:13,465
Stop!

808
01:08:14,802 --> 01:08:18,053
Hey. We should collect
some supplies for a fire.

809
01:08:18,055 --> 01:08:19,264
It's gonna be
another cold night.

810
01:08:20,432 --> 01:08:21,891
MOM,

811
01:08:21,893 --> 01:08:23,643
can you go collect some sticks?

812
01:08:27,064 --> 01:08:28,273
Thanks.

813
01:08:33,654 --> 01:08:35,028
Oh!

814
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:37,701
And don't get too close to the
road where you might be seen.

815
01:08:38,243 --> 01:08:39,619
Stay close.

816
01:08:52,297 --> 01:08:55,299
Good idea for packing these.

817
01:08:55,301 --> 01:08:57,468
Sorry if I ate too much.

818
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:59,428
It's okay.

819
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:09,856
I guess I came a little
more prepared than you.

820
01:09:14,779 --> 01:09:16,072
So, why are you here?

821
01:09:17,323 --> 01:09:18,575
I could ask you
the same thing.

822
01:09:19,451 --> 01:09:21,534
Well, my dad
is getting remarried,

823
01:09:21,536 --> 01:09:23,788
and I'm hiding
a robot-like monster.

824
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:27,292
I just left.

825
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:30,250
Come on, PJ.

826
01:09:30,252 --> 01:09:33,295
Look. My life hasn't been
all happy-go-lucky either

827
01:09:33,297 --> 01:09:35,090
since...

828
01:09:35,884 --> 01:09:37,133
...since we were...

829
01:09:37,135 --> 01:09:39,427
Friends?

830
01:09:39,429 --> 01:09:41,970
You're not gonna lose
whatever popularity you have

831
01:09:41,972 --> 01:09:44,059
because you admit
we were friends.

832
01:09:45,268 --> 01:09:46,560
It's already gone.

833
01:09:47,979 --> 01:09:49,396
They weren't really
my friends, anyway.

834
01:09:51,106 --> 01:09:53,275
Didn't take too long
for them to abandon me, too.

835
01:09:55,028 --> 01:09:56,818
I didn't abandon you.

836
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:59,321
Sam, you completely shut me out
after the accident.

837
01:09:59,323 --> 01:10:01,156
Well, my mother did die.

838
01:10:01,158 --> 01:10:02,991
I'm sorry I didn't
give enough attention to you.

839
01:10:02,993 --> 01:10:04,661
Whatever.
You always do this.

840
01:10:05,497 --> 01:10:07,120
Do what?

841
01:10:07,122 --> 01:10:08,373
Shut people out.

842
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:11,375
You completely shut me out
and left me with no one.

843
01:10:11,377 --> 01:10:14,586
You know how my family is.
I had no one to turn to.

844
01:10:14,588 --> 01:10:15,671
You were my only friend.

845
01:10:15,673 --> 01:10:17,255
I had to make new friends.

846
01:10:17,257 --> 01:10:20,595
Well, you didn't have to turn into
someone else and become a huge jerk.

847
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:27,349
I was angry.

848
01:10:27,351 --> 01:10:29,184
So was I.

849
01:10:29,186 --> 01:10:31,314
I'm sorry I embarrassed you
in front of everyone.

850
01:10:32,981 --> 01:10:34,648
It's okay.

851
01:10:34,650 --> 01:10:46,076
We both know
I deserved it.

852
01:10:46,078 --> 01:10:50,706
Giant.

853
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:51,540
Dwarf.

854
01:10:51,542 --> 01:10:52,666
- Giraffe.
- Mouse.

855
01:10:52,668 --> 01:10:53,960
- Bigfoot.
- Hobbit.

856
01:10:53,962 --> 01:10:55,505
- Stretch.
- Smalls.

857
01:11:14,858 --> 01:11:16,150
Roy?

858
01:11:19,194 --> 01:11:20,195
Babe?

859
01:11:28,954 --> 01:11:30,289
Hi.

860
01:11:32,792 --> 01:11:34,127
I did this.

861
01:11:35,211 --> 01:11:39,088
No, you did not.

862
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:40,507
No, you did not.

863
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:44,346
You are the best dad.

864
01:11:53,604 --> 01:11:55,397
Your daughter does
need you right now...

865
01:11:58,525 --> 01:11:59,610
...and...

866
01:12:01,738 --> 01:12:03,196
...I think she's made it
pretty clear

867
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:05,408
that she's not ready
for a stepmom yet.

868
01:12:07,034 --> 01:12:08,241
Yeah, but she will be.

869
01:12:08,243 --> 01:12:09,996
I mean, she just needs
some more time.

870
01:12:12,623 --> 01:12:13,625
No...

871
01:12:18,128 --> 01:12:19,419
You can't force her

872
01:12:19,421 --> 01:12:23,340
into something
she's not ready for.

873
01:12:23,342 --> 01:12:24,510
It's not fair.

874
01:12:27,721 --> 01:12:34,643
She's been through so much.
You know?

875
01:12:34,645 --> 01:12:35,727
No, don't do that.

876
01:12:35,729 --> 01:12:37,064
Don't do that.

877
01:12:39,567 --> 01:12:40,819
Syd, don't.

878
01:12:42,945 --> 01:12:44,363
She's not ready.

879
01:12:48,909 --> 01:12:52,079
And I wanted nothing more than
to be a part of this family.

880
01:12:54,623 --> 01:13:13,182
I'm so sorry.

881
01:15:03,461 --> 01:15:04,794
Roy, pick up.

882
01:15:04,796 --> 01:15:07,213
I think I know where Sam went.
She's at the lake.

883
01:16:44,186 --> 01:16:45,561
We should get water.

884
01:16:45,563 --> 01:16:47,065
Yeah. Something to drink.

885
01:16:47,774 --> 01:16:48,983
Sam!

886
01:16:49,818 --> 01:16:53,861
PJ?

887
01:16:53,863 --> 01:16:54,903
Sydney?

888
01:16:54,905 --> 01:16:56,822
Oh, my God.
I can't believe I found you.

889
01:16:56,824 --> 01:16:58,534
You need to-
you need to go!

890
01:16:59,243 --> 01:17:01,576
I need to go?

891
01:17:01,578 --> 01:17:04,789
Protect Sam.

892
01:17:07,918 --> 01:17:09,085
You don't need
to worry about me.

893
01:17:09,087 --> 01:17:10,460
You're not my mom.

894
01:17:10,462 --> 01:17:12,379
Hey!

895
01:17:12,381 --> 01:17:13,465
Sam!

896
01:17:14,134 --> 01:17:15,342
Hey.

897
01:17:16,051 --> 01:17:17,720
I know I'm not your mom.

898
01:17:18,805 --> 01:17:20,056
I could never be Wendy.

899
01:17:21,306 --> 01:17:24,726
And I know you weren't born
to me, but I choose you.

900
01:17:24,728 --> 01:17:27,394
I choose you
and your father.

901
01:17:27,396 --> 01:17:28,729
So, forgive me.

902
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:31,275
I'm always gonna worry
about you.

903
01:17:32,735 --> 01:17:34,943
And I need to make sure
the both of you

904
01:17:34,945 --> 01:17:37,821
get home
where you belong.

905
01:17:37,823 --> 01:17:39,074
Understand?

906
01:17:43,662 --> 01:17:44,705
Sam!

907
01:17:45,707 --> 01:17:47,623
Protect!

908
01:17:47,625 --> 01:17:48,583
Sam!

909
01:17:48,585 --> 01:17:50,002
Stop!
What are you doing?!

910
01:17:52,671 --> 01:17:53,963
Sam!

911
01:17:53,965 --> 01:17:56,007
Get off her!

912
01:17:56,009 --> 01:17:57,967
What's happening?
Has it done this before?

913
01:17:57,969 --> 01:18:00,218
No. This isn't right.

914
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:01,803
We need to turn it off.

915
01:18:01,805 --> 01:18:03,723
The off switch
on the back of the arm.

916
01:18:03,725 --> 01:18:05,308
MOM, stop!

917
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:06,561
It's not working!

918
01:18:07,395 --> 01:18:08,268
PJ!

919
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:10,937
Sydney bad.

920
01:18:10,939 --> 01:18:12,065
MOM, stop!
You need to calm down!

921
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:13,357
She is not bad!

922
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:16,653
Sydney bad.

923
01:18:23,453 --> 01:18:24,410
Sam?!

924
01:18:24,412 --> 01:18:25,786
That's Sydney's car.

925
01:18:25,788 --> 01:18:26,829
Wait, Roy.

926
01:18:26,831 --> 01:18:28,289
There's supposed to be
a storm coming.

927
01:18:28,291 --> 01:18:29,165
I'll drive us down.

928
01:18:29,167 --> 01:18:30,583
Okay, all right.

929
01:18:43,765 --> 01:18:44,972
Sam!

930
01:18:47,185 --> 01:18:48,726
Baby, baby, baby!

931
01:18:48,728 --> 01:18:49,936
Hey, hey!

932
01:18:49,938 --> 01:18:51,187
Hey, sweetie!

933
01:18:51,189 --> 01:18:54,898
Put her down!

934
01:19:18,882 --> 01:19:20,633
My God.

935
01:19:20,635 --> 01:19:21,761
Put her down!

936
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:24,219
We need to stop this.

937
01:19:24,221 --> 01:19:25,556
Come with me.

938
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:37,900
You sure about this?

939
01:19:40,572 --> 01:19:42,487
No! Stay back!

940
01:19:43,323 --> 01:19:44,699
MOM!

941
01:20:00,216 --> 01:20:02,008
It's time.

942
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:04,012
Sam...

943
01:20:05,305 --> 01:20:06,931
I'm always here.

944
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:14,102
Sam, no!

945
01:20:14,104 --> 01:20:16,147
Sam!

946
01:20:57,524 --> 01:20:58,981
Sam?

947
01:20:58,983 --> 01:21:00,566
Hey, she's awake!

948
01:21:00,568 --> 01:21:02,110
Hey, Sam!

949
01:21:02,112 --> 01:21:03,238
Hey, baby!

950
01:21:05,073 --> 01:21:06,533
How are you? Huh?

951
01:21:08,076 --> 01:21:09,828
- Dad?
- Yeah, baby!

952
01:21:10,453 --> 01:21:13,329
I'm so sorry.

953
01:21:13,331 --> 01:21:15,039
I'm sorry...

954
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:16,040
...for what I said.

955
01:21:16,042 --> 01:21:17,959
- No, shh. Look at me.
- For what I did.

956
01:21:17,961 --> 01:21:19,671
None of that matters.

957
01:21:22,047 --> 01:21:24,341
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you, too.

958
01:21:27,302 --> 01:21:29,639
Sam, how you feelin', honey?

959
01:21:30,681 --> 01:21:31,680
I'm okay.

960
01:21:31,682 --> 01:21:32,889
You?

961
01:21:32,891 --> 01:21:34,267
I'm okay.

962
01:21:34,269 --> 01:21:36,309
I'm just really glad
you're back.

963
01:21:40,065 --> 01:21:41,398
Thank you...

964
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:51,241
...for finding me.

965
01:21:51,243 --> 01:21:52,826
Where's your ring?

966
01:21:52,828 --> 01:21:54,454
Oh...

967
01:21:54,456 --> 01:21:55,746
...Actually, um...

968
01:21:55,748 --> 01:21:57,165
Uh, actually, uh...

969
01:21:57,167 --> 01:21:58,583
...I have it.

970
01:22:03,006 --> 01:22:04,046
Sweetie...

971
01:22:04,048 --> 01:22:05,591
...we've decided to...

972
01:22:07,801 --> 01:22:09,011
It's okay.

973
01:22:17,770 --> 01:22:24,858
Sydney...

974
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:26,486
Will you be my stepmom?

975
01:22:34,953 --> 01:22:36,997
You don't have to do this.

976
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:40,126
I choose you, too.

977
01:23:40,478 --> 01:23:42,769
When you turn
your pages to chapter six,

978
01:23:42,771 --> 01:23:46,065
you will see we will now
be covering life science.

979
01:23:46,067 --> 01:23:49,652
Yes, we are finally
going to do some dissections.

980
01:24:00,998 --> 01:24:02,331
Dude, check it out!

981
01:24:02,333 --> 01:24:03,585
Hey, guys.

982
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:11,174
What is it about?

983
01:24:16,305 --> 01:24:17,722
Hey!

984
01:24:17,724 --> 01:24:19,223
Do you need a ride?

985
01:24:19,225 --> 01:24:21,183
I rode my bike.

986
01:24:21,185 --> 01:24:22,518
I'll race you home.

987
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,644
Already there, slow-poke.

988
01:24:24,646 --> 01:24:25,854
Ha ha ha.

989
01:24:39,453 --> 01:24:43,205
Okay, I think we
can call that one a tie.

990
01:24:43,207 --> 01:24:45,165
Ooh!
Don't be a sore loser, now.

991
01:24:45,167 --> 01:24:46,709
What?

992
01:24:46,711 --> 01:24:48,503
Well, you look out
for me next time, little miss.

993
01:24:48,505 --> 01:24:50,754
Next time, I'll give you
a head start.

994
01:24:50,756 --> 01:24:51,673
With my training wheels.

995
01:24:51,675 --> 01:24:53,883
With your training wheels?

996
01:24:53,885 --> 01:24:55,343
Wow!

997
01:25:10,819 --> 01:25:12,693
Looking good.

998
01:25:12,695 --> 01:25:14,863
Thanks.

999
01:25:15,657 --> 01:25:17,322
Is it ready?

1000
01:25:17,324 --> 01:25:19,325
Well, let's give it a go.

1001
01:25:19,327 --> 01:25:21,035
You can do the honors.

1002
01:25:38,721 --> 01:25:41,013
Hey, hey, no big deal.

1003
01:25:41,015 --> 01:25:42,889
We'll just come out and...

1004
01:25:42,891 --> 01:25:44,142
...give it a try tomorrow.

1005
01:25:44,144 --> 01:25:54,067
Let's go in.

1006
01:26:06,597 --> 01:26:11,597
