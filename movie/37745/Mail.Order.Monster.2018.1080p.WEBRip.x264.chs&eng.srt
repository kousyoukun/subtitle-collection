00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,251
尝尝我激光的厉害 
Enjoy the sweet taste of my lazor beam!

2
00:00:46,253 --> 00:00:50,297
不 别激光我 启动保护屏障
No, not the lazor beam. Engage force field!

3
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:51,214
皮杰

4
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:52,884
小姐 请系好安全带 
Put your seat belt on, young lady.

00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:57,095
萨曼塔·佩珀 不要让我说第二遍 
Samantha Pepper I will not ask you again.

00:00:57,097 --> 00:00:59,056
小萨 现在就系

8
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:02,561
好吧 
Okay, fine.

00:01:07,983 --> 00:01:09,317
妈妈 
Mom!

9
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:17,317
{\an8}三年后

10
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,965
请同学们打开课本 
Open your textbook, please.

11
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,299
希望下次考试大家能考得好一点 
Hopefully, we can do better on the next test.

12
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:19,429
电在之前被认为是一个危险而异怪的东西
Electricity was considered nothing but a dangerous idea

13
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,431
而爱迪生正出生于这个时代...
or fad when Edison was born in...

14
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,560
有人知道是哪年吗？
Anyone?

15
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,351
佩珀小姐？
Ms. Pepper?

16
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,768
1847年 
1847.

17
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,603
我们听不见你的声音 小不点
We can't hear you, Smalls.

18
00:02:28,605 --> 00:02:30,231
1847年 
1847.

19
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,275
而到了1931年
But, by 1931,

20
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:34,943
也就是爱迪生逝世的年份 
the time of Edison's death,

21
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:37,032
各个城市里都通上了电
cities were powered by electricity.

22
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:44,370
皮杰…请不要嚼口香糖 
PJ... no gum, please.

23
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,705
然而 今天仍有许多人不了解它
However, still today,many do not understand

24
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:48,916
人们不仅不了解电本身知识
not only the basics of electricity,

25
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,251
- 而且对其的产生机制也知之甚微   - 真可怜 
- but the potential of its power. - Pathetic.

26
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:54,088
电能可以从水 风 
Electricity can be made from water, wind,

27
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,465
太阳 甚至动物粪便中产生 
the sun,and even animal poop.

28
00:02:57,634 --> 00:02:59,427
好吧 今天的家庭作业
Okay. The homework assignment

29
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,970
在课本里
is written at the end of the chapter

30
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,596
本章的最后写着

31
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:04,306
崔西 这听起来很有趣 
Trish, that sounds like so much fun.

32
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:06,017
我们会邀请所有人 
We'll invite everyone.

33
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,393
嗯 至少是那些已经进入青春期的人 
Well, at least those who've hit puberty.

34
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,066
好吧 
Great.

35
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:49,268

37
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:52,354
哦 他又忙着修水槽了 
Oh, he's busy with the sink again.

38
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:54,941
在学校过得怎么样？
How was school?

39
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,069
挺好的 
Fine.

40
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,614

41
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:03,699

42
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,440

44
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,067

47
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:44,240
好啊 当然可以 
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

48
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,824
- 你能搞定吗？ - 交给我吧

49
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:47,286
- 那好吧  - 好 
- All right. - Okay.

50
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,250
嘿 亲爱的 怎么了？
Hey, sweetie. What's goin' on?

51
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,584
我不知道你有没有注意到
I don't think you had a chance to notice,

52
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:59,421
她的头发粘上了口香糖…这已经不是第一次了 
but she has gum in her hair...again.

53
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:01,258
我想她在学校被人欺负了 
I think she's being bullied at school.

54
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,385
我觉得你需要和她谈谈 
I think you need to talk to her.

55
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:07,262

76
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,432
我都要给你做急救了 
I'm gonna have to give you the Heimlich.

77
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,933
你怎么了？
What's the matter with you?

78
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,478
今天西德尼来接你真是帮了大忙 
That was pretty great of Sydney to pick you up today.

79
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,147
- 是吧？我的意思是… - 是的 
- Right? I mean...- Yeah.

80
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,983
呃 修水管比我预想的花的时间要多 
That, uh-that sink took me a lot longer than I expected.

81
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,651
哦 
Oh.

82
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,610
我帮上忙了吧

83
00:06:03,612 --> 00:06:04,654

00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,120
你喜欢她吗？
You like her.Don't you?

85
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,248

Yes, Dad.

87
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,548
其实她已经算是家里的一部分了 
She's practically part of the family.

88
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,759
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

89
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,263
没干什么 你这话是什么意思？
Nothing. What do you mean what am I doing?

90
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,432
你总是这样做 
You always do this.

91
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,685
做什么？
Do what?

92
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,939
吃你的蔬菜 
Eat your veggies.

93
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,110
好吧 你先吃你的 
Well, you eat yours first.

94
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,529
数三个数 
On three.

95
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,865

00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:54,579
还不错 可以继续吃意面了
So good. Back to spaghetti.

99
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,999
- 吃蔬菜真是糟糕的一环
- That was a bad piece.

100
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,957
那是为了替代水 
That was for water.

101
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,459
我想明天晚上
I was thinking we could all go out to-

102
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,752
我们应该一起出去吃个饭 
to eat, tomorrow night.

103
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,839
你懂的 我们三个人 
You know, the three of us.

104
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,466
没问题 
Okay.

105
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,802
我们去那个地方吃 
To our spot.

106
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,682
那个地方？
Our spot?

107
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,561
自从妈妈去世以后我们就没去过那儿 
But we haven't been there since Mom.

108
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,728
是的...
Well...

109
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,688
自从你妈走了以后 我们出去得少了 
We haven't been to a lot of places since Mom,

110
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,649
但是 小萨…

111
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,276
……你不能回避这个小镇上
...you can't avoid every little place in this town

112
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,654
每一个让我们想起她的地方 你明白吗？
that reminds us of her. You know?

113
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:32,574
我们必须让自己走出去…
We-we have to allow ourselves to go out and...

114
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:34,368
…创造新的记忆 
...make new memories.

115
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,454
你总是尝试这么做 
You're always trying to do that.

116
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,164
你刚说了什么？
Excuse me?

117
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:42,584
你总是想要创造新的记忆 
You're always trying to make new memories.

118
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:43,586
萨曼莎

00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,923
你永远是我的小公主 
You're my little girl.

126
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,798
爸爸...

我等不及明天去吃晚饭了 
I can't wait for dinner tomorrow.

129
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,472
我们会度过一段愉快的时光 而且这…

132
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:43,188
我爱你 
I love you.

133
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,730
我也爱你 
Love you, too.

134
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,648
嗯 你知道 我...
Well, you know, I...

135
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,733
…必须亲亲你的脸蛋 
...have to eat your face.

136
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,028
好了 
Okay.

137
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,448

139
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,033
再见 
See ya.

140
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,068
它可以是任何东西 它可以是任何…
It could be anything. It could be anything at...

141
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,611
嘿 小萨 
Hey, Sam.

142
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:35,238
嘿 
Hey.

143
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,657
又不行？
Again?

144
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:38,825
看起来你装了太多
It looks like you have too many

145
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:40,454
不同类型的螺丝 
different screw types going on.

146
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,580
嗯 我不清楚 
Hmm, I dunno.

147
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:44,623
我觉得它可能是由于
It looks to me like it might be

148
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,624
我安装我的传感器方式不对

174
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,113
我以为你只是因为名字而喜欢它

183
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,331
哦...
Aw...

184
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,959

A random thing.

没什么大不了的 
No big deal.

190
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,776
只是因为吉姆说这是限量版的
It's just that Jim said it was one of the rarest ones.

191
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,611

Wasn't that long ago you used to dress up like them.

261

- Oh. - You sure you don't wanna come play?

267
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:58,488
西德尼可能要你教教她
Sydney could use your help.

268
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,405
她自己说自己很会玩纸牌 结果发现玩得很烂
She said she's good at cards and she's horrible.

269
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,866
很烂吗？
I'm horrible!

270
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,451
没事 我不玩 
No. I'm okay.

271

273
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,124
它是…独一无二的 
It's... one of a kind.

274
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,418

to give me a call the next time he gets a new one in.

277
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,049
心机蛮重
Baby steps.

278
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,427
我认为我做得挺好的 
I think I did good.

279
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,515
你考虑好了吗？你快输了 
You ready? You're going down.

280
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:26,391
手气真是差 
Not at cards.

281
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,043

282

它…我们...我们不能把所有的都展示出来 
It's... There's...We can't have all of these up.

287
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,594
你明白吗？
You know?

288
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,973
这不公平 
It's not fair.

289
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,018
对谁不公平？
To who?

290
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,810
西德尼？
Sydney?

291
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,769
真是抱歉 我妈妈让她感到不适 
I'm sorry my mom makes her uncomfortable.

292
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:16,025
小萨 小萨 你知道那不是那样的 
Sam! Sam, you know that's not true.

293
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,133
嘿 
Hey.

294
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,510
你见过包裹之类的东西吗？
Have you seen a package or something like that?

295
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,346
没有 为什么这么问？你在等什么东西到吗？
No. Why? You expecting something?

296
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:49,391
如果收到能告诉我一声吗？
Could you just tell me if you do?

297
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,476
没问题 夫人 
Yes, ma'am.

298
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:52,559
谢啦 
Thanks.

299
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,519
嘿 你想要 嗯 和西德尼和我
Hey, do you wanna, uh,go to the movies

300
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,229
一起去看电影吗？
tonight with Sydney and me?

301
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,565
嗯...我不能去看电影了 
Um... I can't.

302
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,567
我要参加...
I have...

303
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,111
…科学俱乐部 
...Science Club.

304
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,948
我找到了这个 
I found this.

305
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,163
我在学校过得很好 
School's been fine.

306
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:57,210
好吧...其实不太好 
Well... not that fine.

307
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,381
我的成绩依然不错 
My grades are still good.

308
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:05,634
只是 嗯…
It's-it's just, well...

309
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,221
你懂的
You know.

310
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:18,603
我不知道爸爸是否告诉过你 但是……
I don't know if Dad's told you yet, but...

311
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,400
……他又找了别人 
...he met someone.

312
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:26,740
我猜……已经有一段时间了 
I guess it's...been a while now.

313
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,993
她人很好 只是我…
She's nice. I just...

314
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,994
我不知道…
I don't know...

315
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:35,915
……他为什么要打破现状 
...why he's trying to...move on.

316
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:45,424
我们不需要任何其他人 
We don't need anyone else.

317
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:47,885
我们有你 
We have you.

318
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,554
你一直在我们身边 
We'll always have you.

319
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:58,018
嘿 宝贝 
Hey, babe.

320
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,978
官司打得怎么样？
How was court?

321
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,479
嗯 终于结束了 
Well, it's finally over.

322
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,523
比我预料的久得多 
That went significantly longer than I expected.

323
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,566
好吧 今晚我们还看电影吗？
Well, are we still on for a movie tonight?

324
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,068
是的 当然 我很乐意 
Yes, yes, I would love to.

325
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,902
你说服小萨去看了吗？
Is Sam gonna make it?

326
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:07,944
是的 但不是今晚 
Yeah, not tonight.

327
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,282
她被学校的科学俱乐部绑走了 
She's being held hostage by Science Club.

328
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:13,325
哦...
Oh...

329
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,661
我不记得她参加了什么科学俱乐部啊
I don't remember her being in Science Club.

330
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:09,800
挺简单的 
Simple enough.

331
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:50,317
看着就不像是能飞起来的样子 
I can see why this never took off.

332
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:52,735
只需加水即可 
Just add water.

333
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:54,778
好的 就这样 
All right. That's it.

334
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,407
今晚就这样吧
I'm callin' it a night.

335
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,574
好的 
Okay.

336
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:00,826
（电视广告：）穿着衬衫会显得整洁而专业 
Dress shirts come out neat and professional.

337
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:01,744
西裤和宽松裤…
Pants and slacks...

338
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:02,828
晚安 
Good night.

339
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,330
晚安 亲爱的 我爱你 
Good night, sweetie. I love you.

340
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:05,748
我只是想…
I'm just gonna...

341
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,917
…再呆一会儿 
...be here a little longer.

342
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,584
也行 好吧 
That's fine. Okay.

343
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,585
早上见 
I'll see you in the morning.

344
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,837
好的 
Okay.

345
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,632
...对比蒸汽先生（一个牌子）普通烘干机里产生的褶皱明显更多 
...wrinkles inside your dryer than Mister Steamy!

346
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,633
别忘了你还得等它运转几小时 
Forgot about that load for hours?

347
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,177
真是一团皱巴巴的乱七八糟的东西 
That's a wrinkled mess!

348
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,805
没问题 简单地扔在蒸汽先生里 
No problem! Simple toss in Mister Steamy,

349
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:22,849
几分钟后 你的衣服就可以穿了 
and, in minutes, your clothes are ready to wear!

350
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,545
再-见 大脚怪 
Bye-bye, Bigfoot.

351
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:13,042
哇呜  
Ew!

352
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:18,672
- 哇哇  - ...到处都是 
- Wah wah! - ...everywhere!

353
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:27,267
小萨 
Sammy!

354
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:30,769
爸爸？
Dad?

355
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:33,478
你在 你来这里干什么？
What are-what are you doing here?

356
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,023
我来接你 
I'm pickin' you up.

357
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:36,274
我自行车咋办
I rode my bike.

358
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:38,234
没事 我们可以把它扔到后备箱里 
Well, no biggy. We'll throw it in the back.

359
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:39,861
拜托 今晚我为你和西德尼制定了
C'mon. I got something really special planned

360
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:43,030
一些特别环节 所以我们必须准备好 
for you and Sydney tonight,so we gotta go get ready.

361
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:44,407
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

362
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:46,745
爸爸 我不能 我...
Dad, I can't. I...

363
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,661
什么意思？不能是什么意思？
What do you mean? What do you mean you can't?

364
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:50,997
我们把你的自行车扔在我的后备箱里 
We'll throw your bike in the back.

365
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:52,748
快点 我明显要去洗个澡了 走吧 
Come on. I obviously have to shower. Let's go.

366
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,752
爸爸 我 我不能去 我要...
Dad, I-I can't go. I have...

367
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,128
…留堂
...detention.

368
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,130
你从什么时候要被留堂的？
Since when do you have detention?

369
00:29:59,132 --> 00:29:59,963
从现在开始的 
Since now.

370
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,007
所以今晚我不能去 对不起 
So I can't go tonight. Sorry.

371
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,051
嗯 嘿 我们会 呃…
Well, hey. We will, uh...

372
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:04,259
等你留堂完再来接你 
We'll pick you up after detention.

373
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:05,886
爸爸 我不想去 
Dad, I don't wanna go.

374
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,028
小萨上一次被留堂是什么时候的事了？
When was the last time that Sam got detention?

375
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,198
她好像有点状况 
Something's going on with her.

376
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,867
我感觉到了 你知道的 
I feel it. You know?

377
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:30,121
我想你也感觉到了 
And I think you do too.

378
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,126
你知道吗 我最爱你这一点 
You know, that's one of the things I love about you the most.

379
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:39,128
哪一点？
What's that?

380
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:42,509
你很直率
You're not afraid to call me out.

381
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:46,302
西德尼 你是……
Sydney, you are the...

382
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:47,761
...最聪明 
...most intelligent,

383
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:50,432
有敏锐直觉 体贴关心的女人…
intuitive, caring woman...

384
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:57,063
在这一点上我们很不一样 我们很不同 
We don't really fit in here. We're... different.

385
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:59,065
我很喜欢这一点 我原本不想让任何人
I like that,and I wouldn't want anyone

386
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:00,732
走进我们的生活来改变它一丝一毫
to come into our life and change that.

387
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,526
你正是她所需要的 
You're exactly what she needs,

388
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:04,364
更是我不可或缺的 
and exactly what I need.

389
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:08,410
当温迪死了…
When Wendy died...

390
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,827
我从未想过我会…
I never imagined that I would...

391
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:14,415
……和其他人共享我的生活 
...share my life with anyone else.

392
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,792
尤其小萨也不会让别人来插足我们的生活 
Especially with Sam.

393
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:20,585
直到我看到你和小萨在一起时 
When I see you with Sam,

394
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,171
我看到了希望 
it gives me hope.

395
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:24,467
曾经我以为所有希望都消失了 
And I thought all hope was lost.

396
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:32,974
你愿意嫁给我吗？
Would you marry me?

397
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:36,268
我愿意 
Yes.

398
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:41,982
哇 这些日子都留得很晚啊 
Wow, detention runs late these days.

399
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:44,570
是啊 抱歉 马上来 
Yeah, sorry! Be right there!

400
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:51,825
嘿 
Hey.

401
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,494
你做晚饭了吗？
You make dinner?

402
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:55,496
不 你 你错过了 不记得了吗？
No, you-you missed it. Remember?

403
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:57,498
西德尼和我去了盐和胡椒店
Sydney and I went to Salt & Pepper.

404
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,208
哇 
Wow.

405
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,084
又去了吗？
There again?

406
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:19,646
你没有去那里 我真的很遗憾 
You know, I'm really disappointed that you couldn't be there.

407
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,230
是吗...
Well...

408
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,940
好吧...
Okay...

409
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,526
不久前我们才在那里一起吃了晚饭 
I mean, we were just there the other night.

410
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,287
你为什么关电视？
What was that for?

411
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:37,539
萨曼莎…
Samantha...

412
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,165
好的 爸爸 对不起 
Okay, Dad, I'm sorry.

413
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,292
我...
I was...

414
00:32:41,294 --> 00:32:43,544
……今天早些时候对你有些粗鲁 我…
...rude to you earlier today,and I...

415
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:45,298
……保证不会再发生了 
...promise it won't happen again.

416
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:50,301
我继续看电视了 
Keep watching.

417
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:00,061
好吧...
Okay...

418
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,478
现在我不懂为什么了 
Now I'm confused.

419
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,023
小萨 我需要和你谈谈 
Sam, I need to talk to you.

420
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:05,525
好的 
Okay.

421
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:13,783
我 嗯…
I, um...

422
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:16,369
我知道对你来说这一切都很难 你懂的
I know it's been hard,you know,

423
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:18,578
真的很难 
really hard,

424
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,498
这几年 只有我陪在你身边 
these past few years,just having me.

425
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,709
我 我喜欢只有你陪在我身边 
I-I like just having you.

426
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:24,919
好吧 是这样 
Okay, yeah.

427
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:26,336
但随着年龄的增长
But as you get older,you know,

428
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:29,215
你会想要 嗯…
you're gonna wanna have,um...

429
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:31,133
……另一个女性 一个女人
...another female,a woman,

430
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:32,301
出 出现在你的生活中 
in-in your life.

431
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:33,928
那个人听你倾诉 
You know, someone that you can talk to,

432
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,680

拜托 不要那样 
Come on, now. Don't be like that.

445

你怎么能这样对我？
How could you do this to me?

446
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,360
因为我是你的父亲 
Because I'm your father,

447

你知道什么对我最好吗？

451
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:38,242
让妈妈回来 
Having my mom back!

452
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:40,119
但是她已经走了

00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:21,382

这样不安全 
It's not safe.

478
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:08,431
该死
Crap.

479

你昨晚是在里面睡觉的吗？
Did you sleep in there last night?

480
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:17,938
是啊 
I did.

481
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,315
好吧 你在做...
Well, what are you...

482
00:39:19,317 --> 00:39:20,650
你不能进去 
You can't go in there.

483
00:39:20,652 --> 00:39:21,985
你在里面干了什么？
What are you doing in there?

484
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:25,320
一项科学计划 
Science project.

485
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:26,947
我在里面搞得一团糟 所以…
I made a big mess in there, so...

486
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:28,115
…我要打扫干净 
...I'm gonna clean it up.

487
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:29,534
好吧 我会帮你的 
Okay. I'll help you.

488
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,744
不 不 不 不 不 
No, no, no, no, no.

489
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:36,331
没事 我搞得定
It's okay. Got it.

490
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:37,918
好吧 是这样的 小萨...
Okay, well, look, Sam...

491
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,380
我们需要谈谈 
We need to talk.

492
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:43,550
我觉得我们没有必要谈 
I don't think we do.

493
00:39:46,844 --> 00:39:48,012
好吧 
Okay.

494
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:50,640
好吧 嗯…
Okay, well...

495
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,434
放学后我再来看看你 
I will see you after school.

496
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:07,697
好吧 你仔细听好
Okay, so, here's the thing.

497
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:08,905
我需要去上学 
I need to go to school,

498
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,700
所以你得留在这里 
so you need to stay here.

499
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:12,367
学校 
School.

500
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:13,744
我需要去上学 
I need to go to school.

00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:17,706
妈妈要去上学 
MOM go school.

502
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:20,377
不 不 妈妈 你不能去学校
No, no, MOM. You can't go to school.

503
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:41,688

快来 走这边 
Come on. This way.

00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:02,211
不要…离开这个房间 
Do not... leave this room.

507
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,213
好的
Okay.

508
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:07,715
如果有人进来 
Now, if someone come in here,

509
00:41:07,717 --> 00:41:09,135
你打算怎么办？
what are you going to do?

510
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,858
没错 很好 
Yes. Good.

511
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:27,526
好了 
Okay.

512
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:30,320
你看
So...

513
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:36,119
我平时没事做就看这些
These usually keep me pretty occupied.

514
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:38,579
随便翻翻 
Feel free to look through them.

515
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:40,248
我待会儿再来 
I'll be back later.

516

谢谢 
Thanks.

517
00:42:06,192 --> 00:42:07,316
我做了什么？
What have I done?

518
00:42:45,356 --> 00:42:47,900
那么 是你做的吗？
So, was it you?

519
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:52,737
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

520
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:54,655
皮杰储物柜里的怪物 
The monster in PJ's locker.

521
00:42:54,657 --> 00:43:01,579
真不敢相信小巨人吓到尿裤子了
I still can't believe Gigantor peed herself.

522
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:02,957
不 不是我干的 
No, it wasn't me.

523
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:26,439
对不起 
Sorry!

524
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:49,753
没事 是我 
It's okay. It's just me.

525
00:43:50,672 --> 00:43:52,173
小萨 
Sam!

526
00:43:53,007 --> 00:43:54,923
我们必须离开这里 
We gotta get out of here.

527
00:43:54,925 --> 00:43:56,135
刚刚真险
That was a close one.

528
00:44:02,224 --> 00:44:04,518
你在你的咖啡杯里都快搅出一个漩涡了 
You're creating a little whirlpool there.

529
00:44:05,728 --> 00:44:06,978
嗯 好吧 
Hmm. Yeah.

530
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,938
对不起 
Sorry.

531
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,356
还好吗？
You okay?

532
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:11,566
是啊 没事 
Yeah, yeah.

533
00:44:11,568 --> 00:44:12,900
嗯 呃…
It's, uh...

534
00:44:12,902 --> 00:44:13,820
一切都很好 
Everything's great.

535
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:17,490
你向我瞒了什么？
What aren't you telling me?

536
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:21,992
嗯 嗯…
Uh, well...

537
00:44:21,994 --> 00:44:25,829
小萨没有像我希望的那样接受我向你求婚这件事 
Sam didn't take to the proposal as well as I'd hoped.

538
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:27,041
她还没有准备好 
She isn't ready.

539
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:29,208
对她来说可能太快了 
It's too soon for her?

540
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:30,376
不 不 不 不 不 不 
No, no, no, no, no, no.

541
00:44:30,378 --> 00:44:32,586
她很好 只是 嗯…
She's fine. It's just, uh...

542
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:33,838
……她还不明白 
...she doesn't understand, yet.

543
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:39,135
你知道吗
You know,

544
00:44:39,137 --> 00:44:41,262
我和她从来没有过只有我们两个人的
we've never really had any one-on-one time,

545
00:44:41,264 --> 00:44:42,682
独处的时间 
just the two of us.

546
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:45,932
如果我们过一天类似于女生日那样的日子 怎么样？
What if we just had,like, a girls' day?

547
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:47,436
你认为她会接受吗？
Think she'd be open to that?

548
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:49,936
是啊 当然
Yeah, yeah.

549
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:50,940
是吧？
Yeah?

550
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:52,856
我的意思是…
I mean...

551
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:54,652
- 值得一试  - 嗯
- It's worth a try. - Yeah.

552
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:27,101
嗯 
Mmh!

553
00:45:38,028 --> 00:45:38,862
妈妈？
MOM?

554
00:45:45,036 --> 00:45:46,579
谁？
Who?

555
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:48,580
你在哪里找到的？
Where'd you find that?

556
00:45:54,336 --> 00:46:07,097
温迪 
Wendy.

557
00:46:25,242 --> 00:46:29,537
嘿 妈妈…
Hey, MOM...

558
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:49,932
这真是太棒了 
This is awesome.

559
00:46:49,934 --> 00:46:51,851
好的 我们快做完家务了 
All right. We're almost done.

560
00:46:51,853 --> 00:46:53,101
我们只剩下一个房间没打扫了 
We just have one more room left.

561
00:46:53,103 --> 00:46:54,644
跟我来 
Come with me.

562
00:47:06,034 --> 00:47:08,159
我有种预感你会在这里玩得很开心 
I have a feeling you're gonna have some fun in here.

563
00:47:18,045 --> 00:47:19,755
这些是我的玩具人 
These are my action figures.

564
00:47:21,007 --> 00:47:23,092
它们与你在漫画书中看到的差不多 
They're similar to the ones you saw in the comic book.

565
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:31,476
别弄这些…
Let's just...

566
00:47:32,601 --> 00:47:35,394
这个是…
And here is a...

567
00:47:35,396 --> 00:47:37,315
我一直在研究的机器人原型 
...robot prototype I've been working on.

568
00:47:38,233 --> 00:47:40,191
现在还没有做完 
It's not finished yet.

569
00:47:40,193 --> 00:47:41,650
它仍然存在一些漏洞 
It still has a few holes in it.

570
00:47:41,652 --> 00:47:43,362
嘿 不要 嘿 
Hey, no! Hey!

571
00:47:44,197 --> 00:47:45,362
别碰那个 
Don't touch that.

572
00:47:48,034 --> 00:47:49,577
好的 
Okay.

573
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:52,619
哦 实际上…
Oh, actually...

574
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:02,588
你也看这个东西这么不顺眼？
It was that out of place, huh?

575
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:04,134
是的 
Yes.

576
00:48:06,177 --> 00:48:09,302
什么...是...?
What... is...?

577
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:10,847
只是一封愚蠢的邀请函 
Just a stupid invitation

578
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:12,892
是几个坏女孩送的 
from a couple of mean girls.

579
00:48:14,018 --> 00:48:16,019
坏？
Bad?

580
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:16,978
没错 
Yes.

581
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,688
这些女孩…
These girls...

00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:21,275
...嗯 皮杰是其中最坏的 
...well, one in particular,PJ is bad.

583
00:48:24,195 --> 00:48:27,988
皮杰很坏？
Pee Jay bad?

584
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:29,824

585
00:48:29,826 --> 00:48:31,244

Friends.

你又想出去了吗？
You want to go outside again?

592
00:48:56,353 --> 00:48:58,394
我们不能出去 抱歉 
We can't. I'm sorry.

593
00:48:58,396 --> 00:49:00,106
这太冒险了 
It's too risky.

594
00:49:02,275 --> 00:49:03,608
你得离开房子了
We gotta get you out of here.

595
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:05,278
爸爸马上就要回家了

- 嘿  - 爸爸

610
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,951
为什么 为什么要找我？你想要什么？
Why-why is that? What do you need?

611
00:49:53,952 --> 00:49:55,284
因为…
Okay. Because...

637
00:51:18,161 --> 00:51:22,329
小萨...

638
00:51:22,331 --> 00:51:24,917
温迪...

640
00:52:07,293 --> 00:52:09,334

643
00:52:14,675 --> 00:52:17,469
西德尼很坏吗？

644
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:20,972

她不是一个坏人 
She's not a bad person.

646
00:52:23,059 --> 00:52:24,269
只是…
It's just that...

647
00:52:25,394 --> 00:52:27,230
…她真的改变了我的爸爸 
...she's really changed my dad.

648
00:52:29,065 --> 00:52:30,983
显然他没有意识到这点 
He can't see it,obviously.

649
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,943
他一直说…
He keeps saying that...

650
00:52:34,945 --> 00:52:36,487
…我们应该创造新的忆忆 
...we should make new memories

651
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:40,407
对于我来说她进入我的生活是件好事

652
00:52:40,409 --> 00:52:41,786
…但对我来说不是这样的

653
00:52:43,996 --> 00:52:45,704
我不需要新的记忆 
I don't need new memories,

654
00:52:45,706 --> 00:52:49,374
也不需要一个新妈妈 
or a new mom.

655
00:52:49,376 --> 00:52:50,668
妈妈？
MOM?

656
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,336
不 我不是说你 
No, not you.

657
00:52:52,338 --> 00:52:53,882
我的母亲 温迪 
My mother, Wendy.

658
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:07,644
走这边 
This way.

659
00:53:19,282 --> 00:53:21,365
温迪 
Wendy.

660
00:53:21,367 --> 00:53:23,536
没错 这就是温迪 
Yes. This is Wendy.

661
00:53:26,498 --> 00:53:27,706
温迪是…
Wendy is...

662
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:30,751
是我妈妈 
...well, was my mother.

663
00:53:32,295 --> 00:53:34,503
她只留给我那些照片
All I have left of her now are those pictures

664
00:53:34,505 --> 00:53:36,421
还有回忆了 
and memories.

665
00:53:36,423 --> 00:53:38,509
但是我爸爸只想把它们都扔掉 
My dad just wants to throw them all away.

666
00:53:41,346 --> 00:53:44,429
当我看到我们三个人的合照时
When I see those pictures of us

667
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:45,808
我总觉得…
I feel like...

668
00:53:46,809 --> 00:53:49,519
…她还在这里…
...she's still here...

669
00:53:49,521 --> 00:53:50,647
…在我们身边…
...with us...

670
00:53:52,856 --> 00:53:54,067
…在我身边…
...with me...

671
00:53:55,443 --> 00:53:58,028
…我也不曾让她离开过我身边
...and I didn't cause her to go away.

672
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,489
我只是…
I just...

673
00:54:00,322 --> 00:54:02,155
我不知道我要做什么 
...I don't know what I'm going to do.

674
00:54:15,713 --> 00:54:18,880
永远在你身边 
Always here.

675
00:54:44,742 --> 00:54:46,034

Come on.

676
00:54:46,036 --> 00:54:47,744
现在我们该回去了 
We should be heading back now.

677
00:55:10,476 --> 00:55:11,560
走这边 
This way.

678
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:35,043
皮杰…
PJ...

679
00:55:39,255 --> 00:55:41,088
皮杰很坏 
PJ bad.

680
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:42,632
妈妈 住手 
MOM, stop!

681
00:55:42,634 --> 00:55:44,592
你在干什么？住手 
What are you doing? Stop!

682
00:55:44,594 --> 00:55:47,387
拜托 拜托 
Come on! Come on!

683
00:55:47,389 --> 00:55:55,228
不要 
No.

684
00:56:10,286 --> 00:56:11,494
妈妈 听我说
Now, MOM,

685
00:56:11,496 --> 00:56:14,664
你不能像刚才那样到处乱跑 
you can't just go running around like that.

686
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:16,126
你可能会被抓住 
You might get caught.

687
00:56:17,043 --> 00:56:19,671
皮杰很坏 
PJ bad.

688
00:56:21,338 --> 00:56:24,673
保护小萨 
Protect Sam.

689
00:56:26,677 --> 00:56:28,096
谢谢你 
Thanks.

690
00:56:29,222 --> 00:56:30,807

00:56:32,516 --> 00:56:34,226

Roy, she's getting too smart for her own good.

693
00:57:19,105 --> 00:57:21,188
这才是我的好女儿 
That's my girl.

694
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:23,066

01:02:28,414 --> 01:02:29,748
这不是你的错 
This isn't your fault.

731
01:02:32,668 --> 01:02:35,753
她有没有什么朋友 我们可以打给他们的家长 
Does she have any friends whose parents we can call?

732
01:02:35,755 --> 01:02:36,878
我不知道 
I don't know.

733
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:44,929
好吧 
Okay.

734
01:02:44,931 --> 01:02:46,849
我想是时候报警了 
I think it's time to call the police.

735
01:02:56,608 --> 01:02:58,860
小萨要去哪？
Where Sam go?

736
01:02:58,862 --> 01:03:14,458
别担心 我们快到了 
Don't worry. We're almost there.

737
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,586
到了 
We're here.

738
01:03:24,971 --> 01:03:26,972
-罗伊  - 警长 进来吧 
- Roy. - Sheriff, come on in.

739
01:03:34,105 --> 01:03:37,940
回家吗？
Go back home?

740
01:03:37,942 --> 01:03:39,566
不要 我才不回去 
No, we can't.

741
01:03:39,568 --> 01:03:41,818
那不是我想要的生活 
That's a life I want no part in.

742
01:03:43,114 --> 01:03:45,655
西德尼吗？
Sydney?

743
01:03:45,657 --> 01:03:48,992
可能吧
Kind of.

744
01:03:48,994 --> 01:03:50,454
继母…
A stepmom...

745
01:03:51,246 --> 01:03:52,996
…校园欺凌…
...bullies...

746
01:03:52,998 --> 01:03:54,416
没有朋友…
...no friends...

747
01:03:55,751 --> 01:03:59,628
…一个崭新的生活 
...a new life.

748
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:01,215
这些我一点都不想要
I don't want any more part of that.

749
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,173
我不需要那个 
I don't need that

750
01:04:03,175 --> 01:04:06,552
现在我有了你 
now that I have you.

751
01:04:06,554 --> 01:04:08,095
我们互相照顾彼此
We got each other's back.

752
01:04:08,097 --> 01:04:12,143
妈妈保护小萨 
MOM protect Sam.

753
01:04:13,478 --> 01:04:14,646
谢谢 
Thanks.

754
01:04:15,688 --> 01:04:17,022
我也会保护你的 
I'll protect you, too.

755
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,945
我敢打赌我爸爸现在一定吓坏了 
I bet my dad's freaking out right now.

756
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:26,449
爸爸坏？
Dad bad?

757
01:04:28,034 --> 01:04:29,575
不 
No.

758
01:04:29,577 --> 01:04:32,205
好吧 他现在是很坏 
Well, I mean, yeah,right now.

759
01:04:34,039 --> 01:04:35,958
我不知道 解释起来很复杂 
I dunno. It's complicated.

760
01:04:42,882 --> 01:04:43,965
晚安 妈妈 
Good night, MOM.

761
01:04:48,096 --> 01:04:51,181
晚…安 
Good... night.

762
01:05:19,753 --> 01:05:22,711
小萨？
Sam?

763
01:05:22,713 --> 01:05:24,046
皮杰？
PJ？

764
01:05:28,094 --> 01:05:29,552
嘿 哇 妈妈 
Hey, whoa, MOM!

765
01:05:29,554 --> 01:05:30,887
住手 不要 妈妈 
Stop, no, MOM!

766
01:05:30,889 --> 01:05:33,057
不 停 停 冷静 
No, stop, stop! Calm down!

767
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:40,604
皮杰…
PJ...

768
01:05:40,606 --> 01:05:42,398
…这是妈妈 
...meet MOM.

769
01:05:52,202 --> 01:05:53,909
嘘 没有什么可害怕的 
Shh. There's nothing to be afraid of.

770
01:05:53,911 --> 01:05:55,244
妈妈很友好 
MOM is friendly.

771
01:05:55,246 --> 01:05:56,831
她不会伤害你的 
She won't hurt you.

772
01:06:00,543 --> 01:06:01,544
我说的对吗？
Right?

773
01:06:06,215 --> 01:06:08,509
你好 
Hello.

774
01:06:09,885 --> 01:06:11,719
看到了吗？它很善良 
See? It's nice.

775
01:06:20,896 --> 01:06:22,188
一切都好吗 罗伊？
Everything okay, Roy?

776
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:24,648
不 警长 一点都不好 
No, Sheriff,everything is not okay.

777
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:27,275
我要疯了
I'm going crazy over here. Okay?

778
01:06:27,277 --> 01:06:28,653
我不能再呆坐在这里了 
I can't just sit here anymore.

779
01:06:28,655 --> 01:06:30,445
我需要去外面找我的女儿 
I need to be out there looking for my daughter.

780
01:06:30,447 --> 01:06:31,405
我知道这很难 
I know it's hard.

781
01:06:31,407 --> 01:06:32,407
但是罗伊 听我说 
Roy, listen to me.

782
01:06:32,409 --> 01:06:35,075
你必须呆在家里 
You have to stay home.

783
01:06:35,077 --> 01:06:35,952
如果是我的孩子 
If it were my kid,

784
01:06:35,954 --> 01:06:37,286
我也想出去找 
I'd be wanting to get out there, too.

785
01:06:37,288 --> 01:06:39,204
但小萨最有可能
But Sam's most likely

786
01:06:39,206 --> 01:06:40,414
在接下来的48小时里
to call or come home

787
01:06:40,416 --> 01:06:42,583
打电话给家里或是回家 
in the next 48 hours,

788
01:06:42,585 --> 01:06:44,501
所以必须有人守在家里 
so someone needs to be there.

789
01:06:44,503 --> 01:06:46,086
我保证…
I promise...

790
01:06:46,088 --> 01:06:47,630
...我们会找到她的 
...we'll find her.

791
01:06:47,632 --> 01:06:48,465
好吧 
Okay.

792
01:06:49,092 --> 01:06:51,467
我...谢谢 
I... thank you.

793
01:06:53,972 --> 01:06:56,266
长官 我们收到了一个新的失踪儿童报案
Sir, we got another report about a 10-31.

794
01:06:58,268 --> 01:07:00,478
收到 我们正在路上 
Roger. 10-31. We're on our way.

795
01:07:01,646 --> 01:07:04,063
又一个失踪的孩子 
Another missing kid.

796
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:47,398
你会变得很漂亮的
You're gonna look so good.

797
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,275
哎哟 
Ow!

798
01:07:50,402 --> 01:07:52,154
看起来好像某人又交了一个新朋友 
Looks like someone made a new friend.

799
01:07:53,405 --> 01:07:56,159
朋友皮杰 
PJ friend.

800
01:07:57,202 --> 01:07:59,746
妈妈 很高兴我们能解除误会 
Glad we could set aside our differences, MOM.

801
01:08:02,164 --> 01:08:03,956
你给它取这个名字是因为…
Did you name it that because of...

802
01:08:03,958 --> 01:08:05,583
不 
No.

803
01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:08,086
这是盒子上的名字 
It was the name that was on the box.

804
01:08:08,088 --> 01:08:09,586
它是一个邮购怪兽 
It's a Mail-Order Monster.

805
01:08:09,588 --> 01:08:12,548
真幸运 你找到那本漫画书了 是吧？
Pretty lucky you found that comic book, huh?

806
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:13,465
别玩 
Stop!

807
01:08:14,802 --> 01:08:18,053
嘿 我们应该收集一些烧火木柴
Hey. We should collect some supplies for a fire.

808
01:08:18,055 --> 01:08:19,264
今晚估计也会很冷
It's gonna be another cold night.

809
01:08:20,432 --> 01:08:21,891
妈妈 
MOM,

810
01:08:21,893 --> 01:08:23,643
你能去收集一些木柴吗？
can you go collect some sticks?

811
01:08:27,064 --> 01:08:28,273
谢谢 
Thanks.

812
01:08:33,654 --> 01:08:35,028
对了
Oh!

813
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:37,701
不要太靠近人多的路边
And don't get too close to the road where you might be seen.

814
01:08:38,243 --> 01:08:39,619
别离我们太远 
Stay close.

815
01:08:52,297 --> 01:08:55,299
装上这些再离家出走真是个好点子 
Good idea for packing these.

816
01:08:55,301 --> 01:08:57,468
对不起 我吃得太多了 
Sorry if I ate too much.

817
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:59,428
没关系 
It's okay.

818
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:09,856
我猜我比你准备得稍微充分一些 
I guess I came a little more prepared than you.

819
01:09:14,779 --> 01:09:16,072
你为什么要离家出走？
So, why are you here?

820
01:09:17,323 --> 01:09:18,575
我也想问你同样的问题 
I could ask you the same thing.

821
01:09:19,451 --> 01:09:21,534
好吧 我爸爸要再婚了 
Well, my dad is getting remarried,

822
01:09:21,536 --> 01:09:23,788
而且我还藏着一个像机器人一样的怪兽 
and I'm hiding a robot-like monster.

823
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:27,292
我只是想离家出走 
I just left.

824
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:30,250
拜托 皮杰 
Come on, PJ.

825
01:09:30,252 --> 01:09:33,295
我的生活也不是全然无忧无虑的 
Look. My life hasn't been all happy-go-lucky either

826
01:09:33,297 --> 01:09:35,090
因为…
since...

827
01:09:35,884 --> 01:09:37,133
…因为我们曾是…
...since we were...

828
01:09:37,135 --> 01:09:39,427
朋友？
Friends?

829
01:09:39,429 --> 01:09:41,970
只是因为你承认我们是朋友 
You're not gonna lose whatever popularity you have

830
01:09:41,972 --> 01:09:44,059
不会让你失去人气的
because you admit we were friends.

831
01:09:45,268 --> 01:09:46,560
事实上 我已经没有人气了 
It's already gone.

832
01:09:47,979 --> 01:09:49,396
反正他们也不是我真正的朋友 
They weren't really my friends, anyway.

833
01:09:51,106 --> 01:09:53,275
他们离开我也没花太多时间 
Didn't take too long for them to abandon me, too.

834
01:09:55,028 --> 01:09:56,818
我没有离开你 
I didn't abandon you.

835
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:59,321
小萨 车祸之后你对我拒之门外
Sam, you completely shut me out after the accident.

836
01:09:59,323 --> 01:10:01,156
因为我妈妈去世了啊
Well, my mother did die.

837
01:10:01,158 --> 01:10:02,991
对不起 我没有给你足够的关注 
I'm sorry I didn't give enough attention to you.

838
01:10:02,993 --> 01:10:04,661
随便吧 你总是这样做 
Whatever. You always do this.

839
01:10:05,497 --> 01:10:07,120
我做什么了？
Do what?

840
01:10:07,122 --> 01:10:08,373
把人拒之门外 
Shut people out.

841
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:11,375
你完全把我拒之门外 让我孤独一人 
You completely shut me out and left me with no one.

842
01:10:11,377 --> 01:10:14,586
你知道我的家庭是怎样的 我没有地方可以求助 
You know how my family is. I had no one to turn to.

843
01:10:14,588 --> 01:10:15,671
那时你是我唯一的朋友 
You were my only friend.

844
01:10:15,673 --> 01:10:17,255
我必须要交新朋友 
I had to make new friends.

845
01:10:17,257 --> 01:10:20,595
可是你也用不着性情大变 变成一个大混蛋 
Well, you didn't have to turn into someone else and become a huge jerk.

846
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:27,349
那时我很生气 
I was angry.

847
01:10:27,351 --> 01:10:29,184
我也是 
So was I.

848
01:10:29,186 --> 01:10:31,314
对不起 我在大家面前让你难堪 
I'm sorry I embarrassed you in front of everyone.

849
01:10:32,981 --> 01:10:34,648
没关系 
It's okay.

850
01:10:34,650 --> 01:10:46,076
我们都知道这是我罪有应得 
We both know I deserved it.

851
01:10:46,078 --> 01:10:50,706
大高个 
Giant.

852
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:51,540
小矮子 
Dwarf.

853
01:10:51,542 --> 01:10:52,666
- 长颈鹿  - 小老鼠 
- Giraffe. - Mouse.

854
01:10:52,668 --> 01:10:53,960
- 大脚怪  - 霍比特 
- Bigfoot. - Hobbit.

855
01:10:53,962 --> 01:10:55,505
- 大个子  - 小个子 
- Stretch. - Smalls.

856
01:11:14,858 --> 01:11:16,150
罗伊？
Roy?

857
01:11:19,194 --> 01:11:20,195
亲爱的？
Babe?

858
01:11:28,954 --> 01:11:30,289
嗨 
Hi.

859
01:11:32,792 --> 01:11:34,127
这都是我造成的 
I did this.

860
01:11:35,211 --> 01:11:39,088
不 这和你没有关系 
No, you did not.

861
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:40,507
和你没有关系 
No, you did not.

862
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:44,346
你是最好的爸爸 
You are the best dad.

863
01:11:53,604 --> 01:11:55,397
你女儿现在真的很需要你…
Your daughter does need you right now...

864
01:11:58,525 --> 01:11:59,610
…而且…
...and...

865
01:12:01,738 --> 01:12:03,196
...我想她表达得很清楚了
...I think she's made it pretty clear

866
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:05,408
她还没有准备好接受一个继母 
that she's not ready for a stepmom yet.

867
01:12:07,034 --> 01:12:08,241
是的 但她迟早会接受的 
Yeah, but she will be.

868
01:12:08,243 --> 01:12:09,996
她只是需要多点时间 
I mean, she just needs some more time.

869
01:12:12,623 --> 01:12:13,625
不...
No...

870
01:12:18,128 --> 01:12:19,419
你不能强迫她
You can't force her

871
01:12:19,421 --> 01:12:23,340
接受她没有准备好的东西 
into something she's not ready for.

872
01:12:23,342 --> 01:12:24,510
这不公平 
It's not fair.

873
01:12:27,721 --> 01:12:34,643
她经历了这么多
She's been through so much. You know?

874
01:12:34,645 --> 01:12:35,727
不 不要那样做 
No, don't do that.

875
01:12:35,729 --> 01:12:37,064
不要那样 
Don't do that.

876
01:12:39,567 --> 01:12:40,819
西德 不要 
Syd, don't.

877
01:12:42,945 --> 01:12:44,363
她还没有准备好 
She's not ready.

878
01:12:48,909 --> 01:12:52,079
我希望能够真真正正成为这个家庭的一份子
And I wanted nothing more than to be a part of this family.

879
01:12:54,623 --> 01:13:13,182
对不起
I'm so sorry.

880
01:15:03,461 --> 01:15:04,794
罗伊 接电话
Roy, pick up.

881
01:15:04,796 --> 01:15:07,213
我想我知道小萨去哪儿了 她在湖边 
I think I know where Sam went. She's at the lake.

882
01:16:44,186 --> 01:16:45,561
我们应该找点水 
We should get water.

883
01:16:45,563 --> 01:16:47,065
是啊 一些喝的东西 
Yeah. Something to drink.

884
01:16:47,774 --> 01:16:48,983
小萨 
Sam!

885
01:16:49,818 --> 01:16:53,861
皮杰？
PJ？

886
01:16:53,863 --> 01:16:54,903
西德尼？
Sydney?

887
01:16:54,905 --> 01:16:56,822
哦 我的天啊 不敢相信我终于找到了你 
Oh, my God. I can't believe I found you.

888
01:16:56,824 --> 01:16:58,534
你必须 必须得走 
You need to- you need to go!

889
01:16:59,243 --> 01:17:01,576
我为什么要走？
I need to go?

890
01:17:01,578 --> 01:17:04,789
保护小萨 
Protect Sam.

891
01:17:07,918 --> 01:17:09,085
你不必为我担心 
You don't need to worry about me.

892
01:17:09,087 --> 01:17:10,460
你不是我妈妈 
You're not my mom.

893
01:17:10,462 --> 01:17:12,379
嘿 
Hey!

894
01:17:12,381 --> 01:17:13,465
小萨 
Sam!

895
01:17:14,134 --> 01:17:15,342
嘿 
Hey.

896
01:17:16,051 --> 01:17:17,720
我知道我不是你妈妈 
I know I'm not your mom.

897
01:17:18,805 --> 01:17:20,056
我永远不可能是温迪 
I could never be Wendy.

898
01:17:21,306 --> 01:17:24,726
我知道你不是我生的 但我选择了你 
And I know you weren't born to me, but I choose you.

899
01:17:24,728 --> 01:17:27,394
我选择了你和你的父亲 
I choose you and your father.

900
01:17:27,396 --> 01:17:28,729
所以 原谅我 
So, forgive me.

901
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:31,275
我需要担心你 
I'm always gonna worry about you.

902
01:17:32,735 --> 01:17:34,943
我需要确保你们两个
And I need to make sure the both of you

903
01:17:34,945 --> 01:17:37,821
回到你们的家里 
get home where you belong.

904
01:17:37,823 --> 01:17:39,074
明白了吗？
Understand?

905
01:17:43,662 --> 01:17:44,705
小萨 
Sam!

906
01:17:45,707 --> 01:17:47,623
保护

住手 你在做什么？
Stop! What are you doing?!

小萨 
Sam!

910
01:17:53,965 --> 01:17:56,007
别靠近她 
Get off her!

911
01:17:56,009 --> 01:17:57,967
发生了什么事？以前有发生过这种情况吗？
What's happening? Has it done this before?

912
01:17:57,969 --> 01:18:00,218
不 这不对劲 
No. This isn't right.

913
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:01,803
我们需要关掉它 
We need to turn it off.

914
01:18:01,805 --> 01:18:03,723
关闭的开关在手臂的后面 
The off switch on the back of the arm.

915
01:18:03,725 --> 01:18:05,308
妈妈 住手 
MOM, stop!

916
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:06,561
这不管用 
It's not working!

917
01:18:07,395 --> 01:18:08,268
皮杰!
PJ 

918
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:10,937
西德尼很坏 
Sydney bad.

919
01:18:10,939 --> 01:18:12,065
妈妈 住手 你需要冷静下来 
MOM, stop! You need to calm down!

920
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:13,357
她不是坏人 
She is not bad!

921
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:16,653
西德尼是坏人 
Sydney bad.

922
01:18:23,453 --> 01:18:24,410
小萨？ 
Sam?!

923
01:18:24,412 --> 01:18:25,786
那是西德尼的车 
That's Sydney's car.

924
01:18:25,788 --> 01:18:26,829
等等 罗伊 
Wait, Roy.

10925
01:18:26,831 --> 01:18:28,289
马上就要下暴雨了
There's supposed to be a storm coming.

926
01:18:28,291 --> 01:18:29,165
我开车到底下看看 
I'll drive us down.

927
01:18:29,167 --> 01:18:30,583
好的 没问题 
Okay, all right.

928
01:18:43,765 --> 01:18:44,972

Come with me.

你确定这管用吗？
You sure about this?

938
01:19:40,572 --> 01:19:42,487
不 往后退 
No! Stay back!

939
01:19:43,323 --> 01:19:44,699

你愿意做我的继母吗？
Will you be my stepmom?

974

994
01:24:51,675 --> 01:24:53,883
用你的辅助轮？
