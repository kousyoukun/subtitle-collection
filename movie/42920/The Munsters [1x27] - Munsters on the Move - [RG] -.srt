[Clanging]

3
00:00:11,124 --> 00:00:14,389
Lily, either hang those things
so they don't fall down...

4
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:17,396
or have them tuned.

5
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:19,955
Lily? Lily!

6
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:23,400
I have some wonderful news for you,
and I can't keep it in any longer.

7
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,495
I'm busting at the seams.

8
00:00:25,572 --> 00:00:28,507
Well, don't do it in here, dear.
I'm getting supper.

9
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:31,066
I have to tell you
what happened today.

10
00:00:31,144 --> 00:00:34,375
Mr. Gateman down at the parlor
asked me into his private office,

11
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:36,541
and he gave me
a great compliment.

12
00:00:36,616 --> 00:00:39,551
He said I'm one of the few people there
who never lies down on the job.

13
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:43,851
Oh, Herman, you've really stuck
to the job down there.

14
00:00:43,924 --> 00:00:46,688
You've seen a lot of people
come and go.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,856
Well, don't keep us in midair.
What did your boss say?

16
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:52,865
He gave me a promotion.

17
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:56,494
He's making me manager
of one of our branch offices.

18
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,232
Oh, manager!

19
00:00:59,306 --> 00:01:03,140
Oh, wait till Grandpa's relatives
in the Old Country hear about this!

20
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,373
They'll really sit up on
their hind legs and take notice.

21
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:10,140
There's only one thing.

22
00:01:10,217 --> 00:01:14,085
For me to take the job, we have
to sell the house and move to Buffalo.

23
00:01:14,154 --> 00:01:16,645
- Sell the house?
- Sell the house?

24
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:18,657
That's right.

25
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:22,217
And then all we Munsters
will just shuffle off to Buffalo.

26
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:27,561
? Oh, I'll go and get my shoesies
and we'll pack up all our bluesies?

27
00:01:27,634 --> 00:01:29,727
? And away we'll go?

28
00:01:29,803 --> 00:01:31,737
? Ooh, ooh, ooh?

29
00:01:31,805 --> 00:01:35,707
? Off we're gonna shuffle
shuffle off to Buffalo??

30
00:01:35,776 --> 00:01:38,210
[Crashing]

31
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:45,178
Uh, Spot? Spot! Go fetch!
[Growling]

32
00:01:45,252 --> 00:01:47,618
Bring back Daddy.
[Growling]

33
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,524
And,

34
00:02:58,592 --> 00:03:02,756
uh, inasmuch as this new job
touches all our futures,

35
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:05,821
I thought it very important
to convene the entire family.

36
00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:08,163
Big deal.
We were all sitting here, anyway.

37
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:11,170
All you had to do
was start talking.

38
00:03:11,238 --> 00:03:13,331
By the way, where's Eddie?

39
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:16,466
He's spending the weekend with
one of his little friends from school.

40
00:03:16,543 --> 00:03:18,477
Oh, yes.

41
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:21,309
Well, uh, now,

42
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:23,315
on the pro side of this thing,

43
00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:27,342
this promotion will mean
a sizable increase in salary, plus...

44
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,912
a lot of other benefits,
which will accrue.

45
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:33,391
But, on the other hand,

46
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,520
it is also gonna mean that we...

47
00:03:37,597 --> 00:03:41,363
Lily? Grandpa?

48
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:43,664
Oh, where did everyone go?

49
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:45,500
Herman, we're all here.

50
00:03:46,706 --> 00:03:49,402
Oh. Oh, yes.

51
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:52,343
Uh, of course.
As I was saying, now...

52
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:55,643
Uh, but, on the other hand,

53
00:03:55,715 --> 00:03:58,479
it will also mean selling
this beautiful home,

54
00:03:58,552 --> 00:04:02,579
with all its charm and graciousness
and exquisite furniture.

55
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:08,618
And I thought that,
in a matter so vital to all of us,

56
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:11,858
we should put it to a family vote.

57
00:04:11,932 --> 00:04:14,730
Uh, Lily?
Herman,

58
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:17,497
a wife's place is with her husband.

59
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:20,062
Whither thou goest, I shall go.

60
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,108
Good.

61
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:25,611
Lily has decided to "whither"
with me. Marilyn?

62
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,772
Oh, I'd be happy to move to Buffalo.

63
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:30,247
Maybe I'll meet some boys
who won't think I'm so plain.

64
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:33,115
Good. Grandpa?

65
00:04:33,186 --> 00:04:36,121
It's all right with me.
I'm as free as a bat.

66
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:38,123
I can pull up stakes anytime.

67
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:40,819
Fine. Then it's all settled.

68
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:43,954
I'll call Mr. Gateman,
tell him I'll take the new job,

69
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:47,591
and we'll put an ad in the newspaper
and sell this house.

70
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:50,898
There's one person we haven't
consulted yet... little Eddie.

71
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:53,872
Oh, well, I'm sure he'll go for it.

72
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:59,378
Children always adjust very easily
to any new environment.
[Chuckling]

73
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:02,142
It was neat, Eddie,
the way Coach
made you catcher...

74
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:04,479
and picked you for the captain
of the baseball team.

75
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:06,485
There's a lot of guys
better than me.

76
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:11,081
What I think sold the coach
was the way you snagged up
those foul tips with your teeth.

77
00:05:11,157 --> 00:05:13,523
You know, Eddie,
now that you're on our team,

78
00:05:13,593 --> 00:05:15,686
we'll probably win
the city championship.

79
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:19,698
I hope so.
I sure like going to this school
and all the guys I met.

80
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:24,135
You know, I'd rather live here than
any other place in the whole world.

81
00:05:24,204 --> 00:05:28,573
Last year, our best shortstop's family
moved him to another school district,

82
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:30,610
and we lost the finals.

83
00:05:30,677 --> 00:05:33,441
So all us guys took an oath
never to speak to him again.

84
00:05:33,513 --> 00:05:35,947
You don't have to worry about that.

85
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:38,450
Once, my mother told me we
were gonna live where we are...

86
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:41,078
for the rest of our lives,
and maybe even longer.

87
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:52,124
Oh, boy, somebody's stopping.

88
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:54,132
Naturally.
[Chuckles]

89
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,761
This is the kind of house that would
stand out in any neighborhood.

00:05:57,837 --> 00:05:59,828
This must be it, Mother.

00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:02,739
"1313 Mockingbird Lane."

92
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,778
Oh, my! That's the kind of a house
in those Alfred Hitchcock pictures...

93
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:09,781
that always gets hit by lightning.

94

00:06:21,928 --> 00:06:24,260
Look at the way they took off.

99
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,891
Well, we wouldn't want to sell it
to any hot-rodders, anyway.

My, what a setup, eh, Momma?

101
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:06,662
First, we run the séances.

102
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,074
Then we make with the phony ghosts.
Then we rake in the dough.

103
00:07:11,144 --> 00:07:13,635
Yeah, Poppa.

104
00:07:13,713 --> 00:07:17,479
Eh, it's a little clean, but it'll do.

105
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:22,817
Now listen, kids. Don't steal
nothing till we make the deal, eh?

[Thunderous Knocking]

107
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:37,098
Yes?

108
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:40,931
Poppa, what do you think?

109
00:07:41,007 --> 00:07:45,307
I think the gypsies got here first
and spook the place already.

110
00:07:45,378 --> 00:07:49,041
Uh, excuse the intrude.
Uh, good luck, brother.

111
00:07:50,183 --> 00:07:53,016

112
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:59,885
Herman, what's the matter?
You look as black as a sheet.
Those were gypsies.

113
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:03,656
They cast spells, practice sorcery
and give people the evil eye.

114
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,494
Oh, I'm glad they
didn't buy our house.
Me too.

115
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:08,898
I can't stand competition.

116
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:15,171
Oh, Herman, we've had
open house all day.

117
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:18,540
And the few people who did
show up didn't even come in.

118
00:08:18,611 --> 00:08:20,579
I just can't understand it.

119

This house offers everything
a family could want.

120
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:28,119
And we're close-in,
and we have a beautiful yard
with a kidney-shaped swamp.

Oh! Susie, if this place is for sale,

122
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:39,354
there must be some
wonderful old relics inside.

123
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:42,799
Perhaps we can
pick them up for a song.

124
00:08:42,869 --> 00:08:44,962
Oh!

Oh. D-Do you think
we should knock?

I think we should go right in.

129

And just look at this antique hat rack.

I bet they don't realize its value.

We'll tell 'em it's a lot of junk

He's had indigestion all morning.

Oh. I guess he got out again and got
ahold of some bad telephone poles.

to sit on the house for a while.

gonna have to pack a lot of things.

00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:08,909
Come on. Wake up!
Let me sleep
another hundred years.

156
00:11:08,982 --> 00:11:11,780
Pops.
Oh.

157
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:15,150
I'm sorry.
Yeah, tell me something.
This your ad in the paper?

158
00:11:15,221 --> 00:11:16,779
Yes.
This the price?

159
00:11:16,856 --> 00:11:18,790
That's right.
I'll take it.

160
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:21,156
You'll take it?
But you haven't seen it yet.

161
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:23,422
Do you wanna argue
or sell the house?

162
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:26,260
Yeah, but...
Here's a check
for the down payment.

163
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:29,927
Just sign this contract
for the temporary bill of sale.
Ooh!

164
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:32,938
Well, thank you. Thank you.

165
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:35,474
Yeah, thank you.
Forget it.

166
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,475
Oh, and, uh, Pops,

167
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:40,444
if I were you,
I'd get back in the house.

168
00:11:40,513 --> 00:11:42,981
You look like you've been out
in the sun too long.

169
00:12:03,836 --> 00:12:06,999
Grandpa, that's wonderful.
You sold the house.

170
00:12:07,073 --> 00:12:10,634
Well, it did take all my charm
and powers of salesmanship,

171
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,873
but I really put on the pressure
and closed that deal.

172
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:17,109
Now we can move to Buffalo,
and Uncle Herman can take his new job.

173
00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:20,118
Oh, boy, old Hermie's got it made.
[Laughing]

174
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:23,952
? I'll go up and get my shoesies
and we'll pack up all our bluesies?

175
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:26,457
? And away we'll go?

176
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:28,619
[Together]
? Ooh, ooh, ooh?

177
00:12:28,694 --> 00:12:33,393
? Off we're gonna shuffle
shuffle off to Buffalo??

178
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:36,128
[Laughing]

179
00:12:36,202 --> 00:12:39,899
Hey, what's all the excitement?
Did Grandpa win
the Transylvanian sweepstakes?

180
00:12:39,972 --> 00:12:44,136
No, Eddie, but we have some
wonderful, wonderful news for you.

181
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,304
Yeah? Well, I've got some good news too.
It's about the school baseball team.

182
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,814
Eddie, uh, just a minute.

183
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:53,079
Your father has a new job.
We just sold the house.

184
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:55,347
And we're all moving to Buffalo.

185
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:58,083
- Isn't that wonderful, Eddie?
- I won't go!

186
00:12:58,157 --> 00:13:01,149
I won't! I won't! I won't!

187
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:04,196
You can't make me!
You can't! You can't!

188
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:10,030
I'm not gonna leave my friends!
I'm not! I'm not! I'm not!

189
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:14,096
You can kill me a million,
million times, and I still won't go.!

190
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:19,607
[Door Creaking, Closing]
You know, Lily, I don't think
he exactly cares for the idea.

191
00:13:25,618 --> 00:13:29,213
Grandpa, I wonder how Herman's
making out with Eddie.

192
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:31,552
He's upstairs now,
trying to calm him down.

193
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:35,560
I had no idea he'd be so upset
about moving and leaving his friends.

194
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:37,562
I know how it is.

195
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,724
In the Old Country,
I was always getting attached
to my friends and neighbors,

196
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,234
especially at night.

197
00:13:43,302 --> 00:13:47,534
Well, one thing about Herman...
he has a way of getting
to the heart of a matter.

198
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:51,509
And so the little rabbit
said to the prairie dog,

199
00:13:51,577 --> 00:13:54,011
"Listen, prairie dog,
why do you take your family...

200
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,016
and move out of a perfectly good
burrow to someplace far away?"

201
00:13:58,084 --> 00:14:00,575
What's a burrow?
Burrow?

202
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:03,417
Well, it's sort of like
a home, sort of.

203
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:06,424
But what the little rabbit was trying
to tell the prairie dog was...

204
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:09,984
that he shouldn't move
just because he thought the food
was better somewhere else.

205
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:14,624
I think it's dumb for a rabbit
to tell a prairie dog what to do.
Exactly.

206
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,032
And you know what happened?
What?

207
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:20,197
The prairie dog did move
with his whole family,

208
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:24,175
and he found out the food was better
and the new burrow was better,

209
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:28,009
and he made lots of new friends
and everything was... neato!

210
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,049
And the stupid rabbit stayed
where he was and ate the dumb food...

211
00:14:31,117 --> 00:14:33,711
and stayed with his dumb friends.
Right.

212
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:37,688
And somebody probably caught
the rabbit and painted him pink
for Easter or something.

213
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:40,123
Exactly.
That's what the rabbit got...

214
00:14:40,193 --> 00:14:43,788
for not grasping at an opportunity
and moving to a new place.

215
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:48,197
So, you see what a good idea it
would be for us all to move to Buffalo?

216
00:14:49,602 --> 00:14:53,129
And the prairie dog probably
got eaten by a kangaroo,

217
00:14:53,206 --> 00:14:58,075
'cause he never saw kangaroos before,
and because they didn't have kangaroos
where he used to live.

218
00:14:58,144 --> 00:15:01,307
Right. Uh, uh, no.

219
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,213
No. No, wrong. Wrong, wrong.

220
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:07,582
Uh, Eddie, kangaroos
don't eat prairie dogs.

221
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:10,087
Uh, they're allergic to them.

222
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:12,818
And the stupid rabbit
stayed where he was...

223
00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:16,328
and got fat and had pink kids!

224
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:18,329
Wait a minute.

225
00:15:18,397 --> 00:15:21,764
The prairie dog is the hero
of this story, not the rabbit.

226
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:25,930
And the rabbit sent letters to the prairie
dog, but they came back unanswered.

227
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:28,667
So the rabbit knew it was smarter
to stay in his own burrow...

228
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:31,505
than moving away and getting
eaten up by a kangaroo.

229
00:15:31,577 --> 00:15:34,876
Wait a minute...
Boy, Dad, thanks for
telling me the neat story.

230
00:15:34,947 --> 00:15:37,939
Now I can sleep tonight without
worrying about moving to Buffalo.

231
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:41,180
Gee, Dad, I'm glad you came up here
and explained it to me.

232
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:45,390
Yeah.

233
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,551
Sure, Eddie. So am I.

234
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:57,897
Bye, Mom.

235
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,904
Bye, Dad.
Bye, son.

236
00:15:59,972 --> 00:16:03,135
Now I can go to school and tell
all the guys that I don't have to move...

237
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:06,303
and that I can be the captain
of the school baseball team.

238
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:10,406
Boy, this is the neatest thing
that's happened since
Grandpa dug up Spot for me.

239
00:16:15,221 --> 00:16:17,712
Bye, Spot.
[Growling]

240
00:16:18,758 --> 00:16:21,522
That happy little skip
in that happy little boy...

241
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:25,291
is worth a fortune
to his dear, old dad.
[Chuckling]

242
00:16:25,364 --> 00:16:27,594
Herman, what happened?

243
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:31,569
Last night, you went up to explain
to Eddie why we had to move to Buffalo.

244
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:33,798
Suddenly, this morning,
it's all off.

245
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:37,434
Well, I tried to explain it to him,
but it just didn't work out.

246
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,104
I guess I should've used
the Three Little Pigs.

247
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:42,670
You know, I've always been
rotten with prairie dogs.

248
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:44,841
Well, I'm glad it happened.

249
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:48,148
It just proves to all of us
how much we love this place.

250
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,154
I agree, Marilyn.

251
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:54,158
Grandpa, you go call that
gentleman and tell him we
want out of the house deal.

252
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:56,854
I'm gonna go down to the parlor
and tell Mr. Gateman...

253
00:16:56,929 --> 00:16:59,261
that I just can't take the new job.

254
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:02,961
Herman, he'll be disappointed,
so let him down gently.

255
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:04,969
Lily, have no fear.

256
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:08,268
In my business, we always
let people down gently.

257
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:16,437
But, Mr. Dennison,
we changed our minds.

258
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:20,679
What do you mean we can't?
A sales contract?

259
00:17:20,753 --> 00:17:24,154
Bulldozers, wreckers
on their way over now?

260
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,783
[Chuckling]
Uh, Mr. Dennison, just a minute.

261
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:30,454
You can't talk to me that way.
[Line Disconnects]

262
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:32,690
I guess he can.

263
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:35,427
- Can we get our house back, Grandpa?
- I guess not, Eddie.

264
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:38,402
They're on their way over now
with bulldozers to tear it down.

265
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:40,462
Grandpa, what'll we do?

266
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:43,406
Herman's down at the parlor,
and those men will be here any minute.

267
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:46,707
What'll we do? We'll do
what men have done for centuries.

268
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:49,213
We'll stand firm and defend our homes.

269
00:17:49,281 --> 00:17:53,377
We'll man the battlements, flood the moat
and pull in the drawbridge.

270
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:56,819
But, Grandpa, we don't have
any battlements or any moat.

271
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:59,824
Marilyn, will you please...
Don't be so technical.

272
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:04,124
I haven't had so much fun since
I started the French Revolution.
[Laughing]

273
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:07,565
The chains, Eddie!

274
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:10,067
Right, Grandpa.

275
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:15,740
[Sinister Laughter]

276
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:17,776
?? [Humming]

277
00:18:20,813 --> 00:18:22,747
Here's Grandma's best silver.

278
00:18:22,815 --> 00:18:26,046
Grandma's best silver.

279
00:18:26,118 --> 00:18:28,746
Twenty pounds of bobby pins.

280
00:18:28,821 --> 00:18:31,051
That oughta curl their hair.

281
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:34,954
Uh, here's one of Eddie's skates.

282
00:18:35,027 --> 00:18:37,359
Oh, Eddie's skates.

283
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:42,560
?? [Humming]

284
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:46,997
[Laughs]

285
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:55,743
Wait till they get a taste
of this cast-iron fruit salad.
Here they come!

286
00:19:02,855 --> 00:19:05,483
Oh, I won't fire unless I have to.

287
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,891
I sure hope I have to.

288
00:19:31,684 --> 00:19:35,120
They think they can scare us off.

289
00:19:35,187 --> 00:19:39,317
Listen, you people, I bought this house
to wreck it, and I'm gonna wreck it.

290
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,552
Hold off, sir!

291
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:46,759
Our home is our castle,
and we shall defend it,

292
00:19:46,832 --> 00:19:49,266
down to the last man,
woman and child.

293
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:51,303
How do you like them apples, mister?

294
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,338
What is this?

295
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:55,839
We've run into trouble
like this before.

296
00:19:55,908 --> 00:19:58,342
When we built those freeways,
the little old ladies...

297
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,004
tried to throw themselves down
in front of the bulldozers.

298
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,105
How come those weird getups?

299
00:20:03,182 --> 00:20:06,447
You know these radicals.
They'll do anything to get
their picture in the paper.

300
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:08,453
All right, fellas. Get movin'.

301
00:20:08,521 --> 00:20:12,116
Okay, stand back, people.
We're comin' through.

302
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:14,785
Okay, they're asking for it.

303
00:20:23,469 --> 00:20:26,961
C'est la vie. That's the way
I goofed at Waterloo.

304
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,566
All right, folks.
You had your little joke.
Come on now. Break it up.

305
00:20:30,643 --> 00:20:32,907
Yeah, Pops, knock it off.

306
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,814
What's going on here?

307
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:38,850
Are they kidding with him?

308
00:20:38,918 --> 00:20:43,082
It's just another one
of those Halloween makeups
to try to get us off their backs.

309
00:20:43,155 --> 00:20:46,716
Oh, Herman!
It's been a nightmare.

310
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:50,489
These men are gonna tear down
our house, and Mr. Dennison
won't listen to reason.

311
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:52,827
So we've been
protecting ourselves.

312
00:20:52,898 --> 00:20:57,198
Lily, please. We'll have
to think this thing over.

313
00:20:57,269 --> 00:20:59,669
After all, we did
sign that paper.

314
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:03,640
I knew it! I knew it!
Little Goody Two-shoes
had to show up.

315
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:06,303
Grandpa, right is right.

316
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:10,212
If they bought the house,
they have a right to tear it down.

317
00:21:10,282 --> 00:21:14,946
And you can't just go around
aiming a cannon at everybody
without having anarchy.

318
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,454
And anarchy is violence.

319
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:20,515
And violence is... very naughty.

320
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:23,790
What are you going to do, Uncle Herman,
just let them take the house from us?

321
00:21:23,862 --> 00:21:26,797
Marilyn, we shouldn't have signed
that piece of paper without reading it.

322
00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:30,266
No, I'm going to ask them
if they'll allow us a few weeks
to find a place to live.

323
00:21:30,336 --> 00:21:33,396
Aw, Pop, let's smash 'em now
and talk later.

324
00:21:33,472 --> 00:21:35,906
Eddie, please!

325
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:43,305
Uh, good afternoon, gentlemen.

326
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:47,148
[Laughing]
Uh, I think there's something
we should discuss.

327
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:52,213
Listen, jack. I bought this house
to tear it down and put in a parking lot.

328
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,225
So why don't you just get out.

329
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:57,126
But, sir, uh, uh...

330
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,761
Uh, we... Uh...

331
00:22:07,906 --> 00:22:12,138
Gentlemen, gentlemen, I think
we should talk this thing over.

332
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:14,202
Uh, now, look.

333
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,511
You seem to be reasonable types.
[Chuckling]

334
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:21,815
Uh, if you look
at the thing my... Oh.

335
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:26,381
If you look at the thing my way,
you'll just go back to your office...

336
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,621
and tear up that contract.

337
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:31,629
[Laughing]
[Loud Crash]

338
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:40,228
You see, Lily?
If you reason with people,
they'll see the light.

339
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:45,709
They were in such a hurry to get
back and tear up the contract,
they left their machinery behind.

340
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:48,542
Herman, you saved our home.

341
00:22:48,614 --> 00:22:50,479
Pop, you're a hero.

342
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:53,677
Oh, shucks, it... it was nothing.
[Laughing]

343
00:23:01,126 --> 00:23:05,756
Herman. Herman, we don't
want the neighbors to think
we keep an untidy place.

344
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:08,265
Go out and pick up the street.

345
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,358
Yes, dear.

346
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:21,841
[Grunts]

347
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:30,784
[Sighs]
[Crashing]

348
00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:39,857
"And the property, therefore, reverts
to the original owner, Herman Munster."

349
00:23:39,932 --> 00:23:43,629
That's wonderful!
That's great!
We have our house back.

350
00:23:43,702 --> 00:23:46,227
Signed R. Dennison.

351
00:23:46,305 --> 00:23:49,365
Hmm. Poor man writes
with a shaky hand.

352
00:23:49,441 --> 00:23:52,376
What did they say
down at the parlor, dear?

353
00:23:52,444 --> 00:23:56,608
Oh, well, Mr. Gateman decided
not to open the branch office in Buffalo.

354
00:23:56,682 --> 00:23:59,242
He says he can't afford it.
Can't afford it?

355
00:23:59,318 --> 00:24:02,185
No. He just went over the books
for the last two months...

356
00:24:02,254 --> 00:24:05,087
and found out we've
been going in the hole.

357
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:13,229
Oh, hi, Eddie.
Eddie, you home
from school so soon?

358
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:20,070
[Pans Chime]
Lily, you had them tuned!

359
00:24:21,306 --> 00:24:23,934
Eddie, how was
baseball practice today?

360
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:25,772
[Muffled Chatter]

361
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:29,939
Eddie, uh, turn around, son.

362
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:35,713
Come here. Come here.

363
00:24:38,457 --> 00:24:40,391
[Pops]

364
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:43,360
Herman, there's
no two ways about it.

365
00:24:43,428 --> 00:24:46,920
We're simply going to have
to buy Eddie a catcher's mitt.
