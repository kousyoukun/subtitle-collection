1
00:00:05,585 --> 00:00:08,577
[Announcer]
And our fourth-prize winner here
in our local contest is...

2
00:00:08,655 --> 00:00:12,455
BessieJune Rassmussen
of Apple Valley.

3
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:15,689
Hmph. I knew it wouldn't be me.
?? [Fanfare]

4
00:00:15,762 --> 00:00:18,526
The only thing I ever won
were those free facials
down at Antoine's.

5
00:00:18,598 --> 00:00:21,795
Our third-prize winner is...

6
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:26,567
HarryJerome of 16 Maple Drive.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,476
HarryJerome. Why don't you tell
everybody he's the sponsor's nephew!
?? [Fanfare]

8
00:00:32,546 --> 00:00:36,505
And for our second prize,
our second-prize winner...

9
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:42,249
is Wilma Winninger
of 477 Hesby Avenue.

10
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:46,156
Hesby Avenue?
T-That's clear across town.

11
00:00:46,226 --> 00:00:48,660
Politics! Politics!

12
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:51,129
?? [Fanfare]

13
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,361
And our first-prize winner...

14
00:00:54,434 --> 00:00:58,029
goes to a lucky person right here
in Mockingbird Heights.

15
00:00:58,105 --> 00:01:00,699
It's worth $5,000.

16
00:01:00,774 --> 00:01:06,371
And the first-prize winner is
Mr. Herman...

17
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:10,678
Go ahead and say it.
Mr. Herman Overholtzer.

18
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:13,652
Mr. Herman Flork.

19
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,656
- Mr. Herman Munster.
- Graft! Graft!

20
00:01:17,724 --> 00:01:21,216
Graft! You hear me? G...

21
00:01:21,294 --> 00:01:23,762
Wait a minute. It's me! It's me!

22
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,822
[Yelling]
It's me! I'm Herman Munster!

23
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,893
I'm... Hi! I'm Herman Munster!

24
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:34,134
I won a prize worth $5,000!

25
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:38,200
Lily, Grandpa!
Everybody come in quick!
What's the matter?

26
00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:42,544
What's up, Herman?
What is it?
The contest on TV! I won!

27
00:01:42,616 --> 00:01:46,552
I won! I won! I won! I won!

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,454
I won! I won! I won!

29
00:01:50,524 --> 00:01:53,891
Where are you going, Grandpa?
Where am I going?
Down in the dungeon.

30
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,293
I wanna find out
what Herman's talking about.
He'll be there any minute.

31
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:08,993
Uncle Herman, you can't
keep us in suspense any longer.

32
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:12,004
Come on, Pop.
Tell us about
the neat prize you won.

33
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:14,563
All right. All right. All right.

34
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:18,634
The Munsters... mind you,
the entire family...

35
00:03:18,712 --> 00:03:22,273
has won a membership to
the Mockingbird Heights Country Club.

36
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:25,512
Whoopee!
[Excited Chatter]

37
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:27,712
Oh, that club is so exclusive.

38
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:31,279
Why, you know you have to wait
for one of the members to pass away...

39
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:34,122
before you can even be
considered for membership.

40
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:36,128
I know. That's what's so wonderful.

41
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:38,630
Once we're in, we can stay forever.

42
00:03:38,698 --> 00:03:43,726
As far as I can recall,
no member of my family
ever passed away for good.

43
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:49,469
You know something,
I think I'm gonna
take up golf. [Laughs]

44
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:54,207
Only I'm not sure about
being out in the sun too much.
I'd hate to lose my parlor pallor.

45
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:57,773
You know, Lily,
I'm going to love it.
[Chuckles]

46
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:01,685
It's gonna give me a chance
to mingle with some real blue bloods.

47
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:05,919
Well, Grandpa, if you do,
just don't put the bite
on them right off the bat.

48
00:04:10,263 --> 00:04:13,096
I have a letter here from
the local television station.

49
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,691
They have a winner for
that club membership we donated.

50
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:18,431
I was against that
from the beginning.

51
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:23,909
This is an exclusive club
and awarding a membership
through a contest is very undignified.

52
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:27,811
I'm sorry, Petrie, but I'm inclined
to agree with Reggie.

53
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:30,714
A thing like this can give us
a more popular image
with the community.

54
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:34,083
I'll go along with it
because I seem to be outnumbered.

55
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:36,520
But who are these contest winners?

56
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,356
It's a Mr. And Mrs. Herman Munster
and family of Mockingbird Lane.

57
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:44,921
Well, we have a luncheon
and fashion show
coming up this week.

58
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:50,595
We can invite Mrs. Munster to that
and send Munster a guest card
to play golf.

59
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:55,039
That way, we can get
a close look at them... see if
they measure up to our standards.

60
00:05:00,046 --> 00:05:04,540
You know, Grandpa? I bet it would
even shake up Arnold Palmer
to see me on the putting green.

61
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:08,281
[Both Laugh]
You're good all right, Herman.

62
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:12,689
You know the last time
I saw a swing like that was when
they hung my Uncle George.

63
00:05:13,693 --> 00:05:18,687
Herman! Grandpa!
Uh, Lily. Lily, dear.
Please. I'm shooting.

64
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:32,735
Herman, guess what
the mailman just dropped and ran?

65
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:35,679
My new Bugs Bunny cartoon book?

66
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:39,412
It's a letter from
the Mockingbird Heights Country Club.

67
00:05:39,486 --> 00:05:43,513
They're inviting me to a luncheon,
and they sent you a guest card
to play golf.

68
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,253
Oh. You know, Lily,
that's a very good idea.

69
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:51,457
It'll give us a chance to look over
the club and see if the people
measure up to our standards.

70
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:54,762
We'll have to dress to the occasion.

71
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:58,668
Um, I think I'll wear
my new Transylvanian original.

72
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:02,265
You know, the one with
the-the lovely shroud.

73
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:05,675
Old Hermie, the pro.
[Laughs]

74
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:10,949
Fore!

75
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:24,119
Grandpa, where did
the ball go?

76
00:06:30,036 --> 00:06:33,199
What do you know about that?
A hole in one.

77
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:47,649
From the turnout today,
I think this is going to be
our most successful luncheon.

78
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:50,451
Two of the Munsters
have accepted our invitation,

79
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:52,650
so this will give us a good chance
to look them over.

80
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:57,720
I'm still not sold on this idea
of awarding a membership
through a contest.

81
00:06:57,797 --> 00:07:02,825
It's the duty of this committee
to see to it that only the right sort
of people are admitted to the club.

82
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:07,033
Excuse me,
where are they having the luncheon?

83
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:09,940
- It's in the main grill.
- Thank you.

84
00:07:13,947 --> 00:07:17,314
And that's another area
this committee should take up.

85
00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:20,875
Every time Charley Hinshaw
gets a snootful,

86
00:07:20,954 --> 00:07:23,388
he dresses up
in those ridiculous outfits.

87
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:26,516
That was
the wildest one yet.

88
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:33,522
Lily, the man said that
the luncheon is in the grill room.

89
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,592
Grandpa, this place
is depressingly cheerful.

90
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:39,502
But I suppose this modern decor
is what they go in for.

91
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:51,673
79.95, Sally's Togs Shop.

92
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:57,785
My the people are friendly here.

93
00:07:57,857 --> 00:08:01,850
She told a perfect stranger
where she got her dress
and how much it cost.

94
00:08:01,928 --> 00:08:05,091
Yes, b-but I don't care
for that style.

95
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:07,998
I wouldn't want you
to be seen dead
in a dress like that.

96
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:11,298
You're right, Grandpa.
I'll make a point not to.

97
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:15,364
Never mind, Lily.
Shall we, uh,
have a libation?

98
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:21,878
Hi, folks. A little early
for a masquerade party, isn't it?

99
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:24,439
Sure is.
[All Laugh]

100
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:29,185
Oh, you club people
are so jolly.

101
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:40,025
This is simple chiffon from
the Paris Collection, 129.95.

102
00:08:44,704 --> 00:08:49,539
Now that dress is more like it.
When I used to fly around
in the Old Country,

103
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:52,772
I always found
a high neckline a challenge.

104
00:08:52,846 --> 00:08:57,010
I think it's sweet the way
the women around here
confide in each other.

105
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,075
I think I'll float around a bit
and get acquainted.

106
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:19,061
This is simple chiffon from
the Paris Collection, 129.95.

107
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:29,981
This ensemble has a cape
made of tufted coffin lining...

108
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:34,952
in a lovely shade
of cemetery green.

109
00:09:35,955 --> 00:09:40,119
This little number
was very inexpensive.

110
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:46,689
The fabric is made of
black widow's webs.

111
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:50,827
And the underslip,
pure, unborn centipede.

112
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:10,445
Now, my friend,
this is all very simple.
I'll show it to you again.

113
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:16,155
Now all you have to do
is guess under which nut
the spider is hiding.

114
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:18,993
Of course, if you don't guess
the first time...

115
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:21,727
Grandpa, I showed the ladies
my dress and...

116
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:24,964
Oh, good, you're showing
the bartender the shell game.

117
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:28,235
Don't win too much, Grandpa.
[Both Laugh]

118
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,573
Hey, that's not Charley Hinshaw.
Who are those people?

119
00:10:34,647 --> 00:10:38,515
Those are the Munsters.
Good heavens!

120
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:40,916
He's gambling with the bartender.

121
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:44,821
She's gotten herself so stoned,
she's joining the fashion show.

122
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:48,054
You still want those contest winners
in our club?

123
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:50,322
Petrie, I'm afraid
I'll have to agree with you.

124
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:54,560
But I'll tell you something,
when that Mr. Munster
shows up to play golf,

125
00:10:54,634 --> 00:11:00,300
if he doesn't turn out to be
our idea of a human being,
I'll throw them out personally.

126
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:07,811
Aunt Lily, do you mean the people
were actually rude to you
at the country club?

127
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,873
Yes. When we first went in,
everything was fine.

128
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:16,285
But, suddenly,
I had a feeling we weren't wanted.
That's right, Marilyn.

129
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:20,349
There I was playing my shell game with
the bartender, when all of a sudden,

130
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:25,591
some guy in a dark suit came by,
scooped up my shells
and led me outside.

131
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:28,327
He said they-they
didn't allow nuts in the club.

132
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:31,427
It must be some kind of a rule
of the department of agriculture.

133
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:36,403
I was going around showing off
my dress, when one woman
came up to me and said,

134
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:39,570
"Why don't you go home
and sleep it off, dearie."

135
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:42,978
I tell you, Marilyn.
We might just as well face it.

136
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:46,507
Those people at the country club
are just not our kind of people.

137
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:51,216
Oh, what a shame.
If Uncle Herman went down there
and got insulted...

138
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,589
why, he's so sensitive,
he'd go all to pieces inside.

139
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,824
Oh, that would never do.
The last time that happened,
he rattled for a week.

140
00:11:59,932 --> 00:12:05,097
I guess we'll just have to tell Herman
that it won't work out. That we don't
want to join a club like that.

141
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:09,335
We're home from the golf store.
Yoo-hoo! We're home.

142
00:12:12,745 --> 00:12:15,612
Well, how do you like it?

143
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:20,118
The man at the store said
this is what Ken Venturi wore
when he won the National Open.

144
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:22,518
We're going to play tomorrow,
and I'm going to caddy.

145
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:25,113
I bet everybody will follow us
all over the course.

146
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:30,288
Oh boy, now I know how
the Prince of Wales used to feel.

147
00:12:30,363 --> 00:12:33,025
[Electricity Crackling]

148
00:12:33,099 --> 00:12:37,263
That's fine, Prince.
You better start
feeling like a peasant again.

149
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:39,304
Hmm?
Grandpa.

150
00:12:39,372 --> 00:12:43,809
What's he talking about?
Uh, well, Herman, um,

151
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:46,868
what would you say if we, uh...

152
00:12:46,946 --> 00:12:50,848
well, if we decided
not to join the country club?

153
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:53,249
Not join?

154
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,211
What do you mean "not join"?

155
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:02,956
Lily, I won that membership fair
and square, and if I didn't join
the club, it would crush my spirit.

156
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:06,521
And I don't want my spirit crushed.

157
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:08,362
Oh.

158
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:10,994
But I was thinking that
I'd probably scare the boys away...

159
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,664
just as much at the country club
as I do here.

160
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:16,833
- So I don't care if we join or not.
- You don't?

161
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:20,401
- No.
- And I'd probably get to like...

162
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,473
the luncheons and the teas
and the cocktail parties,

163
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,509
and I'd start coming home late
and serving you TV dinners...

164
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:30,579
and neglecting my family.

165
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:35,423
You know, all those little niceties
that are part of country club living.

166
00:13:35,495 --> 00:13:40,592
A-And Herman, I don't wanna
join the club because
there's no one there of my class.

167
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:44,761
After all, Herman,
you know I'm a full-blooded count.

168
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:49,638
And the closest thing
they have to royalty there
is the bartender, "Duke" Fineberg.

169
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:57,446
You know,
I've suddenly realized something.

170
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:01,479
[All]
You do?

171
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:03,488
Yes.

172
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:07,752
You know what
you've made me realize?
What?

173
00:14:09,762 --> 00:14:13,459
That you don't
give a hoot what I want.

174
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:16,127
What does a man work for
all his life?

175
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:19,035
A little feeling of respectability
and-and success.

176
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:21,437
Well, that's what
joining the club would give me.

177
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:23,771
And that's what I want
and I'm gonna have it.
You hear me?

178
00:14:23,843 --> 00:14:27,108
That's what I want
and I'm gonna have it!
I'm gonna have it!

179
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:31,082
[Loud Thud]
I'm gonna have it! I'm gonna have it!
I'm gonna have it!

180
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:35,143
Excuse me, Lily, while I continue
this conversation with Herman
in the dungeon.

181
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,223
"Dear Lily,
Eddie and I have gone
to the country club.

182
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:50,202
Will play a round of golf
before work.
Signed, Arnie Munster."

183
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:52,863
Look at the time.

184
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:55,430
It's 5:30 a.m.
Half the day is gone.

185
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:57,999
That course
will probably be jammed.

186
00:14:58,077 --> 00:15:03,743
Oh, dear. I just hate the thought
of all those rude people staring
at Uncle Herman when he tees off.

187
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:13,352
"Par five, 580 yards."

188
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:15,417
Hmm. Short one.

189
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,126
Pop?
Hmm?

190
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:30,039
Do you wanna pick a club?
Oh. Good idea, son.

191
00:15:33,512 --> 00:15:38,848
Uh, eenie-meenie-minie-mo.
What am I doing?

192
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:43,252
Eight's my lucky number.
Eight iron, caddy.
[Chuckles]

193
00:15:43,322 --> 00:15:45,483
There you are.
Thank you.

194
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,594
Oh. Now isn't that nice of'em.
They left us two practice balls.

195
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:57,362
Now, the first thing you do, Eddie,
is to address the ball.

196
00:15:58,471 --> 00:16:02,373
Hello, ball.
[Laughs]

197
00:16:03,743 --> 00:16:06,371
[Stammers]
That's a joke, Eddie.

198
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:09,710
Oh. Sorry.
[Imitates Herman's Laugh]

199
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:12,774
Now, Eddie,
the hole's right down there.

200
00:16:12,852 --> 00:16:15,514
Keep your eye on the ball
like a good caddy.

201
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:28,894
Hmm. You know,
those practice balls are nice and big,
but they're made very badly.

202
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:32,237
Give me one of our small ones.

203
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:38,733
Thank you, son. Now.

204
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:40,301
- Ready?
- Ready.

205
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:57,319
Hey, Dad?
Hmm?

206
00:16:57,396 --> 00:16:59,455
It's in the rough.
Darn!

207
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:02,467
On the third hole,
1, 500 yards away.

208
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:05,026
[Grumbling]

209
00:17:05,104 --> 00:17:09,598
I think you overclubbed yourself.
I think you're right.

210
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:13,668
But, as they say in golf, Eddie,

211
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:16,977
you gotta play 'em
where you hit 'em.
Yeah.

212
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:19,882
Come on.
We'll ride down to the ball.
Okay.

213
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:29,517
[Loud Bang]

214
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,791
Why do they call it
the rough, Pop?

215
00:17:41,374 --> 00:17:46,334
[Groans]
That's one of the reasons.

216
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:54,619
[Blows]

217
00:18:02,862 --> 00:18:05,524
[Loud Bang]

218
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:11,563
I think I made the trap.
[Laughs]
Come on, Eddie.

219
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:22,207
Hit it, Pop.!
Hit it.!

220
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:27,446
Now, Eddie,
this is a very important shot.
Getting out of the sand.

221
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,511
Now watch closely.

222
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:40,429
Watch the sand.
Watch the sand, Pop.

223
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:50,773
Eddie! Eddie!

224
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:53,835
[Stammering]
I made it! I made it!
I made it! I made it!

225
00:18:53,913 --> 00:18:56,074
I'm out and I'm pin high.

226
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,916
Eddie? Eddie.

227
00:19:00,986 --> 00:19:04,183
Eddie, where are you, son?
Eddie?

228
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,990
Pop, you made the green!
How about that?
How about that?

229
00:19:13,065 --> 00:19:17,559
You know, Eddie?
I never knew golf
was such a fun game.

230
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:19,797
Come on, son.

231
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,662
Oh. Oopsy-daisy.

232
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:54,906
Oopsy-daisy.

233
00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:00,071
Well, that's what you get
when you putt against the wind.

234
00:20:10,756 --> 00:20:14,157
[Clicks Tongue]
Just as I thought.
I've been putting against the grain.

235
00:20:21,534 --> 00:20:24,367
[Excited Laughter]

236
00:20:24,436 --> 00:20:27,997
I made it! I made it!
I made it! I made it!
I made it! I made it!

237
00:20:28,073 --> 00:20:30,303
I made it! I made it!
I made it! I made it!

238
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:34,312
I made it! I made it! I made it!
[Laughs]

239
00:20:36,815 --> 00:20:38,646
Come on, Pop.
Let's go to the next tee.

240
00:20:38,717 --> 00:20:41,379
Be right with you, Eddie.

241
00:20:59,238 --> 00:21:01,729
[Grunting]

242
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,677
Come on, Pop.
I got your ball.

243
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:15,083
I'm coming, Eddie.

244
00:21:18,257 --> 00:21:20,748
What a great game!

245
00:21:20,826 --> 00:21:24,159
And to think, when I'm a member,
I'll be doing this every day.

246
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:42,837
I just hope those rude people
didn't embarrass Herman when
he tried to play golf this morning.

247
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:47,579
Lily, there's no two ways about it.
That country club is just not for us.

248
00:21:47,653 --> 00:21:52,818
When Herman gets home
from work, I'm sure he'll tell us
he's decided the same thing.

249
00:21:52,891 --> 00:21:56,224
And we all thought
it was so great
when he won that contest.

250
00:21:56,295 --> 00:21:58,320
[Door Creaks Open and Closes]

251
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:04,158
Hi, everybody.
Hello, dear.

252
00:22:05,437 --> 00:22:07,371
Sweetie,
about the country club...

253
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:11,102
Lily, please don't mention
that country club.

254
00:22:11,176 --> 00:22:13,406
It's just too sad to think about.

255
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:15,470
You're right, Herman.
Grandpa!

256
00:22:17,282 --> 00:22:19,944
Read the afternoon paper.

257
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,683
"Fiend desecrates golf course
in early morning.

258
00:22:25,924 --> 00:22:31,055
"Inhuman footprints were found
this morning on putting greens
at the Mockingbird Heights Country Club.

259
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,931
"Enormous gouges taken from turf
and course flooded.

260
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:38,799
Greenskeeper is in a state of shock."

261
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:42,363
- Herman, what does this mean?
- What does it mean?

262
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:46,275
It means that we are not
gonna join the country club.

263
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:49,212
I will not jeopardize
the safety of my family...

264
00:22:49,281 --> 00:22:52,739
at a country club where
some madman is allowed to run loose.

265
00:22:52,818 --> 00:22:57,380
That's right.
That club is just no good all-around.

266
00:22:57,456 --> 00:23:00,789
My letter of disapproval
is already in the mail.

267
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:03,054
I've turned down
that membership I won.

268
00:23:03,128 --> 00:23:07,758
It's a shame we have to forfeit
a $5,000 prize.

269
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:10,233
Well, as far as the money's concerned,
I told the club...

270
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:15,535
that they could use that money
to repair the damage to the course
caused by that madman.

271
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:20,010
It's just lucky you didn't
run into that fiend this morning
when you were playing there.

272
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:22,741
[Gasps]
Lily, don't say
such a thing, dear.

273
00:23:22,815 --> 00:23:26,114
If I ever came face-to-face with
a frightening, horrible creature like that,

274
00:23:26,185 --> 00:23:28,517
it'd scare me out of
a hundred years' growth.

275
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:31,946
Now, Herman...
[Gasps]

276
00:23:38,597 --> 00:23:42,761
Really, Herman.
After all the trouble we've had
with that country club,

277
00:23:42,835 --> 00:23:45,326
haven't you had
enough of golf?

278
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:52,037
[Loud Crash]
Someday, I may find
a golf club worth joining.

279
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:55,603
And it won't hurt
if I keep up with my chip shots.

280
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:10,288
Grandpa? Uh, did you see
where-where the ball...

281
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:15,198
Oh, I'm... Grandpa...

282
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:17,201
Herman,

283
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:20,938
would you do me a favor?

284
00:24:21,006 --> 00:24:25,170
Certainly, Grandpa.
Don't ever
take up bowling!

285
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:29,743
Oh.
