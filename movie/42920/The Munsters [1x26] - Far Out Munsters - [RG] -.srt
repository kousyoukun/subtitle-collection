"1313 Mockingbird Lane."

It's owned by some people
named, uh, "Munster."

But it would be just right
for these, uh, friends of mine.

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,501
And I'm prepared to make
a very attractive offer.

51
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:52,977
Oh, but my aunt and uncle
are out right now,
and Grandfather's up in the attic.

Oh, uh, working?

00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:56,974
Oh, no. He just likes
to hang around up there.

54

I only want to
rent the place for my clients
for the weekend.

And we're prepared
to pay $500.

Well, I really don't believe
they'd consider renting it.

Are you sure
you heard me right, miss?

Oh, well, that's very generous,

60

about having strangers
in the house.

than eight or nine people
ever getting past the front door.

Yes. Well, uh, you folks
think it over.

or uncle call me, huh?

just for the weekend?

He called back three times.

73

put us all up at a hotel
if we'd rent the place.

your shots when I told you to,

saved us $400.

if we do rent the place,

00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:26,298
could I use some of the money
to buy Spot a new toy?

84
00:05:26,373 --> 00:05:30,036
Oh, Eddie, we gave him
a foreign sports car for Christmas.

85
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,203
He played with it
a couple of times,

86
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:34,212
and then he threw it
over the back fence.

what should I tell the man
if he calls back again?

I've thought the thing over
from all angles,

to a conclusion.
