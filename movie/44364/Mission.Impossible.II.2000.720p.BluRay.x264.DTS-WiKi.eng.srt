As far as the media and all

Captain Macintosh
died on the flight.

00:27:46,271 --> 00:27:48,432
But, in fact, he missed it.

Only Ambrose knows that.

and report to you.

Every search for a hero...

that every hero requires--

a villain.

Therefore, in the search
for our hero, Bellerophon,

Bellerophon was a prince
who killed the Chimera.

as a research scientist at Biocyte.

[Hunt] Whatever McCloy's
looking at, he's not happy about it.

492
00:49:24,742 --> 00:49:26,334
Ambrose just pulled...

493
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:28,401
the camera's memory card
and put it into an envelope.
