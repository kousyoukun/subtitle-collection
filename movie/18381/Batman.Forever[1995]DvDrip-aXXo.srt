1
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,239
Can I persuade you to take a sandwich?

2
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,312
I'll get drive-through.

3
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,270
You're counting on the Winged Avenger
to deliver you from evil...

4
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,032
...aren't you, my friend?

5
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,118
Are you going to kill me?

6
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,710
Maybe, maybe not.
We're of two minds on the subject.

7
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,752
Are you a gambling man?

8
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,711
Let's say we flip for it?

9
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,718
One man is born a hero,
his brother a coward.

10
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,599
Babies starve, politicians grow fat...

11
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,677
...holy men are martyred,
and junkies grow legion.

12
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,549
Why?

13
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,196
Why, why, why, why, why?

14
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,435
Luck!

15
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,349
Blind, stupid, simple, doo-dah...

16
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,278
...clueless luck!

17
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,032
The random toss...

18
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,071
...is the only true justice.

19
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,799
Let's see what justice has in store...

20
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,194
...for you.

21
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,151
It's like the touch of God.

22
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,998
Wait, wait, wait.

23
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,269
Fortune smiles.
Another day of wine and roses.

24
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,237
In your case, beer and pizza.

25
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,233
Out of here, guys!

26
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,233
- But you said you'd let me live!
- Too true!

27
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,075
And so you shall! Nothing's better
than live bait to trap a bat.

28
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,153
Hot entrance.

29
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,835
Two-Face?

30
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,035
Two guards are dead.

31
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,429
He's holding a third hostage.
Didn't see this one coming.

32
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,873
We should have.

33
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,632
The Second Bank of Gotham...

34
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,870
Second anniversary
of the day I captured him.

35
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,393
How could he resist?

36
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,833
I'm Chase Meridian.

37
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,198
I asked her to come here to consult
on the case. She specializes in...

38
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,597
Abnormal psychology,
multiple personalities. I read your work.

39
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,749
Insightful.

40
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,398
Naive, but insightful.

41
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,155
I'm flattered. Not every girl
makes a superhero's night table.

42
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,673
Can we reason with him?

43
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,558
- He's got innocent people up there.
- It won't do any good.

44
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,200
- He'll slaughter them without a thought.
- Agreed.

45
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,750
A trauma powerful enough to create
an alternate personality leaves one...

46
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,673
In a world where normal rules
of right and wrong no longer apply.

47
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,715
Exactly.

48
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,915
Like you.

49
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,952
I could write a hell of a paper on a man
who dresses like a flying rodent.

50
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,596
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.

51
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,270
Really? I didn't know that.

52
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,319
You are interesting.

53
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,352
And call me Chase.

54
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,796
By the way, do you have a first name,
or do I call you Bats?

55
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,710
Let's start this party with a bang!

56
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,240
Very punctual, even for his own funeral.
Boys!

57
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,273
Kill the Bat!

58
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,509
Blast him!

59
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,199
Open sesame.

60
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,959
It's a trap!

61
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,194
<i>Attention citizens of fair Gotham!</i>

62
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,796
<i>When we open that safe,</i>
<i>we'll have everything we ever wanted:</i>

63
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,192
<i>Enough cash to rain down upon</i>
<i>fair Gotham, a glorious flood of chaos.</i>

64
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,238
<i>And, of course...</i>

65
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,033
<i>... you, my boy, dead!</i>

66
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,472
It's boiling acid!

67
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,356
<i>For your dying pleasure, we are serving</i>
<i>the acid that made us the men we are!</i>

68
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,350
No!

69
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,308
- Hold on.
- Yes!

70
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,394
Haul away!

71
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,512
Yes! Haul away!

72
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,075
- Give me your hand.
- Don't let go!

73
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,152
I must borrow this.

74
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,237
That's my hearing aid!

75
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,515
Thanks.

76
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,550
Wow! My shoes are melting!

77
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,548
No more!

78
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,635
Hang on.

79
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,915
Hang on?

80
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,154
Get him down.

81
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,548
Get him down.

82
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,391
Take it easy with him.

83
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,870
You'll be all right. Just stay calm.

84
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,118
This'll fix him!

85
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,788
Hang on, Batty!

86
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,115
Let's see.

87
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,789
Yes!

88
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,038
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
Oh, happy day!

89
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,838
Farewell forever to that...

90
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,956
...pointy-eared night rat!

91
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,515
Face!

92
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,911
You need help. Give it up.

93
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,110
Have the good taste to die!

94
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,788
See you!

95
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,479
<i>Despite a valiant effort</i>
<i>last night by Batman...</i>

96
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,348
<i>... Harvey Two-Face is still at large</i>
<i>and extremely dangerous.</i>

97
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,794
<i>In other news today...</i>

98
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,997
<i>... billionaire Bruce Wayne extended</i>
<i>his profit-sharing program...</i>

99
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,790
<i>... to the employees of the successful</i>
<i>electronics branch of Wayne Enterprises.</i>

100
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,348
Mr. Wayne.

101
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,560
Your inspections are
a departmental highlight.

102
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,997
Oh, my God, it's him.

103
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,431
I am a winner. I am a winner.

104
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,999
I am a winner.

105
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,839
I am a winner.

106
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,314
Bioremediation. Alternative fuel.

107
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,478
Mr. Wayne, look at that time.

108
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,836
Perhaps we should get to R & D
as soon as possible.

109
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,268
Mister...?

110
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,712
Oh, Bruce Wayne.

111
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,229
No, that's my name. And you are?

112
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,795
Nygma.

113
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,915
Edward.

114
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,474
Edward Nygma. You hired me personally.

115
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,836
Just like I tell everyone.

116
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,631
We've never actually met, but your name
was on the hiring slip. I have it.

117
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,353
I need that hand back.

118
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,958
Oh, yes, of course.

119
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,559
I'm sorry.

120
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,319
It's just that...

121
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,993
...you're my idol.

122
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,070
Back to work.

123
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,993
And some people have been trying
to keep us apart.

124
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,153
Back to work.

125
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,469
It's okay.

126
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,512
What's on your mind?

127
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,954
Precisely.

128
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,952
What's on all our minds?

129
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,873
Brain waves.

130
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,553
The future...

131
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,716
...of Wayne Enterprises...

132
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,318
...is brain waves.

133
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,711
I must apologize, Mr. Wayne.

134
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,758
- I terminated his project today.
- It's okay.

135
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,115
I have it!

136
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,833
My invention...

137
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,356
...beams any TV signal directly
into the human brain.

138
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,357
By stimulating neurons,
manipulating brain waves...

139
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,072
...this device makes the audience
feel like they're inside the show.

140
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,988
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world?

141
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,833
Did you say "manipulating brain waves"?

142
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,115
Yes.

143
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,069
But...

144
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,193
...someone like you would never need it.

145
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,313
Someone so...

146
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,711
...intelligent, witty and...

147
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,188
...charming.

148
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,116
I need a bit of additional funding
for human trials. Let me show you, please!

149
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,355
Now, listen...

150
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,398
...I want a full set of technical schematics
on this, okay?

151
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,869
We'll be full partners in this, Bruce.

152
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,110
Look at us! Two of a kind!

153
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,071
You call my assistant, Margaret.
She'll set something up.

154
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,195
That's not...

155
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,350
...going to be good for me.

156
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,832
I need an answer now.

157
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,392
I think I deserve it.

158
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,190
I'm sorry, then the answer is no.

159
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,550
Tampering with people's brain waves...

160
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,232
...mind manipulation...

161
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,428
...it just raises too many questions.

162
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,035
Sorry.

163
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,432
Thanks, keep up the good work.
The factory looks great.

164
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,839
All right, everyone!

165
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,194
Back to work!

166
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,311
We'll discuss this later!

167
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,909
You were supposed to understand.

168
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,071
I'll make you understand.

169
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,915
Lock.

170
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,235
Chair.

171
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,033
<i>I saw the signal.</i>

172
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,314
<i>All is ready.</i>

173
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,429
Commissioner?

174
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,714
He's at home.

175
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,912
I sent the signal.

176
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,234
What's wrong?

177
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,157
Last night at the bank I noticed
something about Two-Face:

178
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,275
His coin.

179
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,432
It's his Achilles' heel.

180
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,033
It can be exploited.

181
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,269
I know.

182
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,312
You called me for this?

183
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,311
The Batsignal is not a beeper.

184
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,758
I wish I could say that my interest
in you was...

185
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,598
...purely professional.

186
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,910
Are you trying to get under my cape?

187
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,834
A girl can't live by psychoses alone.

188
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,549
It's the car, right? Chicks love it.

189
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,269
What is it about the wrong kind of man?

190
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,070
In grade school: guys with earrings.

191
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,874
College: motorcycles, leather jackets.

192
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,955
Now...

193
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,952
...black rubber.

194
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,870
Try a fireman. Less to take off.

195
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,516
I don't mind the work.
Pity I can't see behind the mask.

196
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,313
We all wear masks.

197
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,914
My life's an open book. You read?

198
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,314
I don't blend in at a family picnic.

199
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,272
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine...

200
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,510
...you bring your scarred psyche.

201
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,153
Direct, aren't you?

202
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,593
You like strong women.

203
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,398
I've done my homework.

204
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,353
Or do I need skintight vinyl and a whip?

205
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,710
I haven't had much luck with women.

206
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,713
Maybe you just haven't met
the right woman.

207
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,829
I saw the signal.

208
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,717
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

209
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,035
False alarm.

210
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,159
Are you sure?

211
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,315
Women.

212
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,592
Now I've got it!

213
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,433
"Too many questions.
There's too many questions.

214
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,999
"Too many..."

215
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,912
I'll show you it works!

216
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,355
What the hell is going on here?

217
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,474
I told you this project is terminated!
I'm calling Security!

218
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,391
Caffeine will kill you!

219
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,115
Rise and shine, little guinea pig.

220
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,713
What are you doing?

221
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,915
Untie me!

222
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,399
This won't hurt.

223
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,751
At least, I don't think it will.

224
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,433
What are you doing?

225
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,192
You touch that switch and...

226
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,190
This?

227
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,759
Losing resolution.

228
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,474
More power!

229
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,599
Edward Nygma...

230
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,795
...come on down!

231
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,871
You're the next contestant on...

232
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,473
...<i>Brain Drain</i>!

233
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,832
I'll take what's inside
thick skull number one!

234
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,951
What have we got for him?

235
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,273
Oh, Stickley, I'm having a breakthrough!

236
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,872
And a breakdown? Maybe!

237
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,793
Nevertheless, I'm smarter. I'm a genius.

238
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,877
No, several geniuses.

239
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,992
A gaggle, a swarm...

240
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,630
...a flock of freaking Freuds!

241
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,797
Riddle me this, Fred.

242
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,392
What is everything to someone...

243
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,550
...and nothing to everyone else?

244
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,632
Your mind, baby!

245
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,553
Now mine pumps with the power of yours!

246
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,831
"I'm sucking up your IQ

247
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,912
"Vacuuming your cortex

248
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,798
"Feeding off your brain"

249
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,199
What a rush!

250
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,911
What the hell just happened?

251
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,510
A very surprising side effect.

252
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,113
While you were mesmerized
by my 3-D TV...

253
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,913
...I utilized your neural energy
to grow smarter.

254
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,871
Bruce Wayne was right!

255
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,279
You demented, bizarre, unethical toad!

256
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,877
It is brain manipulation!

257
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,276
I'm reporting you to the FCC!

258
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,954
The human experimentation board!
The AMI!

259
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,354
And the police!

260
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,351
You are going up on charges...

261
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,112
...to court, to jail...

262
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,278
...and then to a mental institution
for the rest of your life!

263
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,238
But, first and foremost,
Nygma, you are fired!

264
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,311
Do you hear me? Fired!

265
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,518
I don't think so.

266
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,915
Help!

267
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,308
Hang on!

268
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,955
Babe!

269
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,879
You are fired!

270
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,959
Or should I say...

271
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,034
...terminated?

272
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,991
Surf's up, Big Kahuna!

273
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,430
Nice form, but rough on the landing.

274
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,194
He may have to settle for the Bronze.

275
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,637
"Questions," Mr. Wayne?

276
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,314
My work raises too many questions?

277
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,157
<i>Why hasn't anybody...</i>

278
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,871
<i>... put you in your place?</i>

279
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,114
<i>Harvey Dent,</i>
<i>once Gotham's District Attorney...</i>

280
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,670
<i>... was horribly scarred</i>
<i>by underworld kingpin, Boss Moroni.</i>

281
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,035
<i>Although Batman tried to save him...</i>

282
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,153
<i>... Dent's left-brain damage</i>
<i>turned him into a violent criminal...</i>

283
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,517
<i>... who blamed Batman</i>
<i>and who has vowed to destroy him.</i>

284
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,156
<i>Harvey Two-Face is extremely dangerous,</i>
<i>repeat, extremely dangerous.</i>

285
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,992
That was the Commissioner.

286
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,152
There's been an accident
at Wayne Enterprises.

287
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,158
Horrible way to die.

288
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,470
The surveillance cameras are down here.

289
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,599
We'll dredge the river, but with
that current, I doubt we'll find the body.

290
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,069
Why?

291
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,548
Oh, why?

292
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,197
I just can't believe it.

293
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,074
Two years working in the same office.

294
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,711
He was like my father...

295
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,159
...my brother...

296
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,630
...or a cousin that visits a lot.

297
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,718
Get a grip, Edward.

298
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,518
I found this in my cubicle.

299
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,878
You'll find the handwriting matches his,
as does the sentence structure.

300
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,114
I couldn't possibly continue on here.

301
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,952
The memories...

302
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,309
This is last night's security log.

303
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,233
There's Stickley.

304
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,632
Pretty cut and dry.

305
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,356
Yes, definitely suicide.

306
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,751
Thanks very much for your help, Bruce.
We'll be in touch.

307
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,636
Stickley's suicide doesn't make sense.
I want full benefits for his family.

308
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,394
Suicide's not covered
by our corporate insurance policy.

309
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,072
I know. Full benefits.

310
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,074
Gossip Gerty called 32 times.
Who are you taking to the Charity Circus?

311
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,231
I'll let you know. What's this?

312
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,154
I don't know.

313
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,992
I didn't see anyone.

314
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,679
"If you look at the numbers on my face...

315
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,075
"...you won't find 13 anyplace."

316
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,788
That's hideous.

317
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,479
What does it mean?

318
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,949
It's a riddle.

319
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,076
"Numbers on my face... 13."

320
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,393
One through twelve.

321
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,112
The answer is a clock.

322
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,356
Who would send you a riddle?

323
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,108
That, Maggie...

324
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,753
...is the riddle.

325
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,878
Guess what I did today?

326
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,399
Wayne Manor.

327
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,393
See you soon.

328
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,549
Dr. Meridian, please. Thank you.

329
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,039
I... guess I'm early.

330
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,592
I have an appointment.

331
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,153
I'm Bruce Wayne.

332
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,835
Good.

333
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,514
Then you can afford to buy me a new door.

334
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,354
I'm sorry.

335
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,589
You... sounded like you were in...

336
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,152
...you know, trouble.

337
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,949
I prefer healthy expressions of violence
as opposed to breaking in.

338
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,275
So...

339
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,471
...how can I help you?

340
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,913
Someone's been sending me love letters.

341
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,754
One at my office and one at my home.

342
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,996
Commissioner Gordon thought
you might give me your opinion.

343
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,194
A clock.

344
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,315
Clock.

345
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,914
"Tear one off and scratch my head.

346
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,954
"What once was red is black instead."

347
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,428
A match.

348
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,828
My opinion: this letter writer is a wacko.

349
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,395
"Wacko?"

350
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,632
Is that a technical term?

351
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,634
Patient may suffer from obsession...

352
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,674
...with potential homicidal tendencies.
Is that better for you?

353
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,672
So, what you're saying is...

354
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,591
...this guy's a total wacko.

355
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,908
Exactly.

356
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,232
He's obsessed with you.

357
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,198
His only escape may be
to purge the fixation.

358
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,914
To kill me.

359
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,632
I think you understand obsession
better than you let on.

360
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,234
You like bats?

361
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,197
That's a Rorschach, Mr. Wayne.

362
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,673
An inkblot.

363
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,472
People see what they want.

364
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,949
The question is: do you like bats?

365
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,351
Still playing with dolls?

366
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,830
She's a Malaysian dream warden.

367
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,197
Some cultures believe she protects you
from bad dreams.

368
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,991
It's silly to you, I'm sure.

369
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,113
You look so sad.

370
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,874
Do you need one?

371
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,471
Me? No. Why would I?

372
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,598
You're not exactly what you seem,
are you?

373
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,070
What is it you really came here for?

374
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,918
Yikes, time's up.

375
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,632
That's usually my line.

376
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,791
I'd love to stay here chatting...

377
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,199
Would you?

378
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,314
I'm not so sure.

379
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,434
I must get you out of those clothes.

380
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,674
Excuse me?

381
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,677
And into a black dress.

382
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,434
Tell me, Doctor, do you like the circus?

383
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,191
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

384
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,470
<i>... boys and girls of all ages...</i>

385
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,194
<i>... welcome to the greatest show on earth!</i>

386
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,079
Who is this beautiful young woman
you're with?

387
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,593
Dr. Chase Meridian.

388
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,715
A doctor?

389
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,472
What kind of doctor?

390
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,710
<i>... for Gotham Children's Hospital.</i>

391
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,394
<i>Let's thank our largest single donor:</i>

392
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,679
<i>Bruce Wayne!</i>

393
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,712
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

394
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,390
<i>... 70 feet above the ground...</i>

395
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,836
<i>... performing feats</i>
<i>of unimaginable aerial skill...</i>

396
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,351
<i>... the Flying Graysons!</i>

397
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,515
Listen...

398
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,229
...I'm going rock climbing this weekend.
Would you like to join me?

399
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,639
I'd like to.

400
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,548
I love climbing. I really love it.

401
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,790
But?

402
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,913
I've met someone.

403
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,475
That's fast work. You just moved here.

404
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,272
You could say he just...

405
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,709
...dropped out of the sky and...

406
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,195
...bang!

407
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,358
I think he felt it too.

408
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,629
He sure did.

409
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,716
What?

410
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,674
Who wouldn't?

411
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,995
<i>Now...</i>

412
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,669
<i>... Richard...</i>

413
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,149
<i>... the youngest Flying Grayson...</i>

414
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,070
<i>... will perform the awe-inspiring...</i>

415
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,479
<i>... death drop...</i>

416
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,759
<i>... without the safety...</i>

417
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,989
<i>... of a net!</i>

418
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,554
Let's go.

419
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,108
You'll be okay.

420
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,954
<i>Ladies...</i>

421
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,719
<i>... and gentlemen!</i>

422
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,355
<i>Now, the new management</i>
<i>of the circus invites you to forget...</i>

423
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,750
<i>... this good, wholesome fun...</i>

424
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,520
<i>... and join us in a celebration</i>
<i>of absolute chaos...</i>

425
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,352
<i>... and true jesters!</i>

426
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,639
<i>Bring it on!</i>

427
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,115
<i>Now!</i>

428
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,470
<i>Tonight, a new act for your...</i>

429
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,388
<i>... personal amazement.</i>
<i>We call it, "Massacre under the Big Top."</i>

430
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,514
<i>Let us direct your attention to the ring.</i>

431
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,513
<i>Inside this harmless-looking orb are two...</i>

432
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,674
<i>... that's two hundred sticks of TNT.</i>

433
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,870
<i>And in our innocent hand...</i>

434
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,877
<i>... a radio detonator.</i>

435
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,238
What do you want?

436
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,958
<i>Want, Mr. Mayor?</i>

437
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,957
<i>One simple thing: Batman.</i>

438
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,991
<i>Bruised, broken, bleeding...</i>

439
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,798
<i>... in a word: dead!</i>

440
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,314
Batman.

441
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,431
<i>Who do we have before us?</i>

442
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,113
<i>Gotham's finest...</i>

443
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,555
<i>... well-to-do...</i>

444
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,709
<i>... influential.</i>

445
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,075
<i>Surely one of you knows who Batman is.</i>

446
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,596
<i>Hell, odds are one of you pasty-faced twits</i>
<i>is Batman!</i>

447
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,397
<i>You have two minutes.</i>

448
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,914
Harvey!

449
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,993
I'm Batman!

450
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,549
We can stop them.

451
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,868
Go out on the rigging.

452
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,676
Be careful.

453
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,909
Don't worry.

454
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,758
Go to work, boys!

455
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,432
Our kind of day.

456
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,918
Reach for it! Stop it!

457
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,829
Oh, my God.

458
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,397
It's good you took him in.
He hasn't anyone now.

459
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,030
He's filled out papers all day.
He hasn't slept or eaten.

460
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,072
Welcome, Master Grayson.

461
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,275
I'm Alfred.

462
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,233
How're you doing, Al?

463
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,832
There's a room prepared for you.
But perhaps you'd like to eat first.

464
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,911
Okay, I'm out of here.

465
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,795
Excuse me?

466
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,030
Telling that cop I'd stay here...

467
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,277
...saved me a lot
of social-service interviews.

468
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,029
So, no offense, but no thanks. See you.

469
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,719
Take it easy.

470
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,509
Where will you go? The circus
must be halfway to Metropolis.

471
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,238
Get a fix on Two-Face.

472
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,839
Then I'll kill him.

473
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,874
Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away.

474
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,559
It'll make it worse.

475
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,596
Spare me the sermons, all right?

476
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,794
I don't need your advice or your charity.

477
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,628
Nice bike.

478
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,149
Hang out at a lot of biker bars?

479
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,511
You're almost on empty.

480
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,911
Fill it up in the garage.
There's no gas station for miles.

481
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,953
The pump's over here.

482
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,554
Is this a garage or a car museum, Bruce?

483
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,873
That's a 1917 Harley.

484
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,790
Yep.

485
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,555
Indian Classic, fully restored.

486
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,276
This is a Vincent Black Knight.

487
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,398
They only made a hundred.

488
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,153
A hundred and one, actually.
She's my favorite.

489
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,953
You've got two.

490
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,633
That one doesn't run.

491
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,351
The throttle sticks on this one.

492
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,836
Alfred's a good mechanic, but...

493
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,157
...these need a lot of work.

494
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,398
If someone were to fix them up...

495
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,118
...they could keep one.

496
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,075
Anyway...

497
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,719
...have a nice trip.

498
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,032
You'll land on your feet.

499
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,470
Is the young master leaving?

500
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,835
Pity.

501
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,675
I'll just toss this away then.
Perhaps the dogs are hungry.

502
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,758
Hey, Al, wait up.

503
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,153
Master Bruce?

504
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,037
Just like my parents.

505
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,432
It's happening again.

506
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,756
A monster comes out of the night,
a scream, two shots.

507
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,953
I killed them.

508
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,952
What did you say?

509
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,395
He killed them.

510
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,629
Two-Face.

511
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,070
He slaughtered that boy's parents.

512
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,434
No, no.

513
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,916
You said, "I killed them."

514
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,438
Take care of the kid.

515
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,039
Certainly, sir.

516
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,593
Can I help you settle in, Master Grayson?

517
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:05,956
No.

518
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,431
Thanks, I won't be staying long.

519
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,072
Is this a robin?

520
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,669
My brother's wire broke once
and I swung out and grabbed him.

521
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,071
My father said I was his hero.

522
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,391
I flew in like a robin.

523
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,910
Some hero I turned out to be.

524
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,836
But your father was right.

525
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,190
You are a hero. I can tell.

526
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,277
Throw this away, will you?
I won't need it anymore.

527
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,189
I think I'll just put it in here.

528
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,436
Broken wings mend in time.

529
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,155
One day Robin will fly again.

530
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,789
I promise.

531
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,274
We'll drive.

532
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,189
The Puzzler?

533
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,914
The Gamester?

534
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,153
Captain Kill?

535
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,798
Question Mark Man?

536
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,510
Thank you. Thank you so much.

537
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,553
The Bat's stubborn refusal to expire...

538
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,996
...is driving us insane!

539
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,832
Don't worry, baby.

540
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,157
You'll kill him soon.

541
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,079
Besides...

542
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,271
...I made your favorite:

543
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,311
Sparkling champagne and...

544
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,196
...yummy poached salmon
with little quail eggs and...

545
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,479
...a creamy...

546
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,754
...dreamy...

547
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,718
...lemon soufflé.

548
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,271
No, I made your favorite:

549
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,749
A charred heart of black boar...

550
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,435
...a side of raw donkey meat...

551
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,116
...and a Sterno and grain alcohol,
straight up, baby!

552
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,668
Perfect!

553
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,593
Ladies, you spoil us!

554
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,593
We're of two minds about what to eat first.

555
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,516
What?

556
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,158
I hope you made extra.

557
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,078
Who the hell are you?

558
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,559
Just a friend.

559
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,432
But you can call me...

560
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,593
...The Riddler.

561
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,589
I'll call you dead, is more like it!
How did you find us? Talk!

562
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:05,072
But then if I talked, what would keep you
from slaying me, O Segregated One?

563
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,596
That's never going to heal
if you don't stop picking.

564
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,235
Let's see if you bleed green.

565
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,636
It's not me you want to kill.

566
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:20,189
That's just too easy for someone
as powerful as you and...

567
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,709
...you.

568
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,714
But Batman...

569
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,151
...there's a challenge.

570
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,869
Kill the Bat! Sounds like a good idea.

571
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,156
But have you thought it through? A few
bullets, a splash of blood, then what?

572
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,399
Wet hands.

573
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,396
Post-homicidal depression.

574
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,317
Why not humiliate him first?

575
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,190
Yeah.

576
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,670
Expose his frailties. Then, when he is
at his weakest...

577
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,393
...crush him!

578
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,113
I see that...

579
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,590
...sparkle in your left eye.

580
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,796
I can help you get Batman.

581
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,359
That is, if you'II...

582
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,194
...spare my life for just a few moments.

583
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,514
Thank you.

584
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,512
I love what you've done with this place.
Heavy Metal meets <i>House and Garden</i>.

585
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,514
Beautiful.

586
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,790
It's so dark and Gothic and...

587
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,271
...disgustingly decadent.

588
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,269
Yet so bright and chipper and...

589
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,559
...conservative.

590
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,799
It's so you!

591
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,352
And yet, so you!

592
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,236
Very few people are both a summer
and a winter, but...

593
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,317
...but you pull it off nicely.

594
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,198
What's the point?

595
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:07,392
Has anyone ever told you, you have
a serious impulse-control problem?

596
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,752
This is the point.

597
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,916
This is how I found you.

598
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,992
Let me demonstrate.

599
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,955
This is your brain on The Box.

600
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,991
This is my brain on The Box.

601
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,389
Does anyone else feel like a fried egg?

602
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,674
I'll have more.

603
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,358
There's more. But only the first one's free.

604
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,958
Here's the bargain:

605
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,680
You'll help me steal production capital...

606
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,559
...so I can put a Box on every TV in town...

607
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,235
...and become Gotham's cleverest,
carbon-based life form!

608
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,152
And in return...

609
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,270
Is everybody paying attention?

610
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,233
I will help you solve the greatest riddle
of all.

611
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,356
The mother of all riddles:

612
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,114
Who is...

613
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,919
...Batman?

614
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,910
You broke into our hideout.

615
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,594
You violated the sanctity of our lair.

616
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,320
We should crush your bones into powder.

617
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,675
But you pose an interesting proposition.

618
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,878
Therefore, heads: we accept,
and tails: we blow your damn head off.

619
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,159
Here's a good one.

620
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,593
No, no, no!

621
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,192
There is a good one.

622
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,519
- Leave that. I'll attend to it.
- I'm not used to being waited on.

623
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,119
Don't shoot me!

624
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,589
Don't eyeball me! Give me that!

625
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,235
Two-Face, show me how to punch a guy!

626
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,557
It's dead simple, my boy.
Ball up your fist, reach back...

627
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,278
...and assert yourself.

628
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,990
That looks fun. Let me try.

629
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,870
Ball up the fist, reach way back...
assert yourself.

630
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,638
One hundred thousand,
two hundred and twenty.

631
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,473
One hundred and...

632
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,073
I lost count!

633
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:58,112
<i>Last night another robbery,</i>
<i>perpetrated by the Green-Suited Menace...</i>

634
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,756
<i>... resulting in millions in diamonds stolen,</i>
<i>with no sign of Batman.</i>

635
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,559
<i>Teamed with Two-Face,</i>
<i>this new criminal's pattern...</i>

<i>... of marking his crimes with puzzles</i>
<i>has Gothamites calling him The Riddler.</i>

637
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,437
Apparently, you and Batman
have a common enemy.

638
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,991
That was with the morning mail.

639
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,877
"The eight of us go forth, not back.

640

Clock.

643
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:25,711
Matches.

644
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,552
All physical, man-made objects.

645
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,676
Small in size, light in weight.

646
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,279
What's the connection?

647
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,909
With all due respect,
that's why they call him The Riddler.

648
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,993
May I help you?

649
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,550
Why is this the only locked door?

650
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,712
What's back there?

651
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,916
Master Wayne's dead wives.

652
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,151
The silver closet. On your way.

653
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,068
<i>Now, you can be part of the action!</i>

654

656
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,953

00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,438
<i>Critics claim The Box turns Gothamites</i>
<i>into zombies.</i>

664
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,278
<i>But Edward Nygma just shrugs.</i>

665
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,238
<i>"That's what they said</i>
<i>when TV was invented. "</i>

666
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,834
Master Dick!

667
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,395
Up here.

668
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,351
Just checking, young sir.

669
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,589
<i>Intruder alert. Intruder alert.</i>

670
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,478
I have something for you. It's on the table.

671
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,513
I hope you like it.

672
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,950
Call it clinical intuition.

673
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,155
I thought your dreams needed changing.

674
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,475
My parents were murdered before me...

675
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,272
...when I was a kid.

676
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,434
I don't...

677
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,758
...remember a lot of what happened, but...

678
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,277
...what I do comes to me in my dreams.
Flashes.

679
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,710
There's a new element now, though,
I haven't seen before.

680
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,996
It's a red leather book.

681
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,112
Something else...

682
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,033
My dreams come to me
when I'm awake now.

683
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,198
Bruce, you're describing
repressed memories.

684
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,270
Images of a forgotten pain
that's trying to surface.

685
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,958
I'll be right back.

686
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:48,313
Is it possible there's an aspect
of your parents' death you haven't faced?

687
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,710
You were so young when it happened.

688
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,196
Maybe I should leave you two alone.

689
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,956
This goes way beyond taking
your work home, doesn't it?

690
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,149
All right.

691
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,951
I think he's fascinating.

692
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,794
Clinically.

693
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,918
Why does a man do this?

694
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,469
It's as if he's cursed to pay a penance.

695
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:18,599
What crime could he have committed
to deserve a life of nightly torture?

696
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,352
It's more than just...

697
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,913
...professional interest, isn't it, Chase?

698
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,478
Bruce, are you jealous?

699
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,235
No.

700
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,395
I can't be jealous of Batman.

701
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,598
I want to be close,
but you won't let me near.

702
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,351
What are you protecting me from?

703
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,318
Do you want to know me?

704
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,997
Do you want to know who I am?

705
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,034
I guess...

706
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,677
...we're all two people.

707
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,958
The one in daylight,
and the one we keep in shadow.

708
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,394
Rage...

709
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,959
...violence...

710
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,235
...passion.

711
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,469
Excuse me.

712
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,195
I'm busy.

713
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:14,353
<i>I'm sorry to bother you.</i>
<i>I have some distressing news about Dick.</i>

714
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,835
Is he okay?

715
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,718
<i>I'm afraid Master Dick has gone traveling.</i>

716
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,914
He ran away?

717
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,236
<i>Actually, he took the car.</i>

718
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,873
He boosted the Jag?

719
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,434
<i>Not the Jaguar.</i>

720
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,919
<i>The other car.</i>

721
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,075
The Bentley?

722
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,275
<i>No, sir.</i>

723
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,919
<i>The other car.</i>

724
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:06,038
Come for a little ride
in my love machine, babies?

725
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,753
It's Batman!

726
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,472
Open up, Batman.

727
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,036
Wait!

728
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,599
That's not Batman!

729
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:19,999
What do you mean?

730
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,559
That's Batboy!

731
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,793
It ain't the Bat!

732
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,473
Let her go!

733
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,512
Who the hell are you?

734
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,149
I'm Batman.

735
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,470
I forgot my suit, all right?

736
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,473
Come on, run!

737
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,955
Doesn't Batman ever kiss the girl?

738
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:47,996
Go!

739
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,752
Thanks, you saved my life!

740
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,878
I could definitely get
into this superhero gig.

741
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,234
Batman!

742
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,668
Bastard!

743
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,678
It should've been you!

744
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:37,317
If you had told Two-Face who you were
at the circus...

745
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,431
...they'd still be alive!

746
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:46,319
If Bruce Wayne could've given his life
for your family, he would have.

747
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:55,031
All I can think about every day
is getting Two-Face.

748
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,992
He took my whole life.

749
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,031
When I was out there tonight...

750
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,270
...I imagined it was him I was fighting...

751
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,430
...even when I was fighting you...

752
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,238
...and the pain went away.

753
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,073
Do you understand?

754
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,468
Yes, I do.

755
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:14,835
Good.

756
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,157
You must help me find him.

757
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,194
When we do...

758
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,317
...I'm the one who kills him.

759
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,029
So, you're willing to take a life?

760
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,632
As long as it's Two-Face.

761
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,675
Then it will happen this way:

762
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,319
You make the kill.

763
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,712
But your pain doesn't die with Harvey,
it grows.

764
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:43,555
So you run into the night
to find another face, and another...

765
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,433
...and another...

766
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,476
...until one terrible morning
you wake up and realize...

767
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:52,200
...that revenge has become
your whole life...

768
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,352
...and you won't know why.

769
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,312
You can't understand.

770
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,075
Your family wasn't killed by a maniac.

771
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,793
Yes, they were.

772
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,393
We're the same.

773
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:09,588
If we're the same, help me.
Train me, let me be your partner.

774
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,275
No.

775
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:14,948
I can't.

776
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,631
You still have a choice.

777
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,509
Look, Bruce...

778
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:22,518
...I'm a part of this, whether you like it
or not.

779
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,513
<i>Tonight all of Gotham society</i>

780

What's it like to have your face
on the cover of every magazine?

786
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:15,357
Edward, how does it feel to be
the city's newest, most-eligible bachelor?

787
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,678
Gotham must know!

788
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,352
There's Bruce Wayne!

789
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,275
Brucie!

790
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,756
Oh, Eddie, he is too cute!

791
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,475
How come you don't look so good
in that suit?

792
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,790
Shut up. You're here to work!

793
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,595
How's my mole?

794
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:34,795
Fine.

795
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:38,118
What about rumors of a Nygma Tech
takeover of Wayne Enterprises?

796
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:41,397
Nygma Tech stock is outselling
Wayne Enterprises two to one.

797
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:43,789
Are you yesterday's news, Bruce?

798
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,713
Bruce, old man.

799
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:51,916
The press wonders what it's like
to be outsold, outclassed, out-coifed and...

800
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,710
...generally outdone in every way.

801
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,511
Hello, Edward. Congratulations.

802
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,916
Great party. Nice suit.

803
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:01,873
Wit. Good.

804
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,429
And you are?

805
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,396
Chase.

806
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,674
And what a grand pursuit you must be.

807
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,192
I'm Bruce Wayne, Miss...?

808
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:18,074
You can call me anything you want.

809
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,518
Ladies and gentlemen...

810
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,319
...the future!

811
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:27,878
My New Improved Box offers
fully-interactive holographic fantasies.

812
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,874
Edward, you're dashing and a genius.

813
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,474
How do you create these images, hon?

814
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,468
That, my dear, is my little secret.

815
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,597
Fully-interactive holographs.

816
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,036
Only a high-frequency carrier wave,
beamed into the brain...

817
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,792
...could create such images.

818
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,836
And you wish you thought of it.

819
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,111
Don't be a sore loser.

820
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,351
Step inside. Give it a try.

821
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:23,195
If you can introduce images into the mind,
what stops you from...

822
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,669
...extracting images out of the mind?

823
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,988
Too timid to try my machine? Just say so.

824
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,634
Shall we dance?

825
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,598
Naughty, naughty.

826
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,953
Looking for something?

827
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,873
I was just wondering how you turn it off.

828
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,395
Clever.

829
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,315
Thanks.

830
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:09,754
My pleasure.

831
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,511
<i>Good evening, Mr. Wayne.</i>

832
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,029
<i>Relax.</i>

833
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,833
<i>Tell me your...</i>

834
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,914
<i>... dreams.</i>

835
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,794
<i>Tell me...</i>

836
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,632
<i>... your fantasies.</i>

837
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,037
<i>Tell me your secrets.</i>

838
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,834
<i>Tell me...</i>

839
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,632
<i>... your deepest...</i>

840
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,154
<i>... darkest...</i>

841
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,754
<i>... fears.</i>

842
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,474
Relax, folks!

843
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,678
It's only an old-fashioned, low-tech stickup!

844
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,911
We're interested in the basics:

845
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,508
Cash, jewelry, cellular telephones.

846
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:48,955
Hand them over nice and quietly,
and no one will be hurt!

847
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,432
Emergency, Alfred.

848
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,388
Yes, sir.

849
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:00,958
Be calm, everybody!

850
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,473
Just stay calm!

851
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:03,959
Excuse me!

852
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:10,078
You're ruining my big party!
Are you insane?

853
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:13,434
We're sick of waiting for you
to deliver Batman.

854
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,511
Patience, O Bifurcated One.

855
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,676
Patience, hell! We want him dead!

856
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,309
And nothing brings out the Batman
like a little murder and mayhem!

857
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,834
You could have let me in on the caper.

858
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,993
We could have organized it, planned it,
pre-sold the movie rights!

859
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,349
Your entrance was good, his was better.

860
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,554
The difference?

861
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,039
Showmanship!

862
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,633
Emergency, Alfred.

863
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,113
Oh, sir...

864
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,471
I could be fired for this.

865
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:10,278
Perhaps they'll have me back
at Buckingham Palace.

866
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:23,830
All right, boys! Phase Two!

867
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:29,638
My place, midnight.

868
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,990
Nothing like a bad case of gas!

869
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:14,158
Why can't you just die?

870
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,075
Hi.

871
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:14,278
What were you doing?

872
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:17,113
You got a real gratitude problem,
you know that?

873
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,668
I need a name. Batboy? Knight Wing?

874
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,270
What's a good sidekick name?

875
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,471
"Dick Grayson, college student."

876
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,629
Screw you!

877
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,756
I saved your life. You owe me.

878
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,070
You're going to get yourself killed.

879
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,474
I'm your new partner.

880
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:32,549
No!

881
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:37,517
Whenever you go out at night, I'll be
watching. Where Batman goes, I'll go.

882
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:39,477
How will you stop me?

883
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,599
I can stop you.

884
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,956
Hang this next to the Batsuit...

885
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:49,519
...where it belongs.

886
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,751
You're encouraging him.

887
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,395
Young men with a mind for revenge
need little encouragement.

888
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,318
They need guidance.

889
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:07,872
You, above all, should know
the consequences of the life you choose.

890
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,839
Even Chase calls being Batman a curse.

891
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:21,319
Perhaps the lady is just
what the doctor ordered.

892
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:23,516
She seems lovely and wise.

893
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,316
I've never been in love before.

894
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:28,479
Go to her.

895
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:31,552
Tell her how you feel.

896
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,194
She wants Batman, not Bruce Wayne.

897
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,234
Let her decide.

898
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,354
I'm sorry.

899
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,152
I can't believe this.

900
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,992
I've imagined this moment
since I first saw you.

901
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:38,719
Your eyes...

902
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,033
...your lips...

903
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:43,799
...your body.

904
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,677
Now I have you and...

905
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,880
...I'm wishing you were somebody else.

906
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,720
I guess a girl has to grow up sometime.

907
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,398
I've met someone.

908
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:10,239
He's not you.

909
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,551
I hope you can understand.

910
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,113
I understand.

911
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,149
Well...

912
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,311
That's just what I said.

913
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,554
Then I taught my doggie a new trick:

914
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,231
How to map the human mind.

915
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:59,950
Would you like to see
what Bruce Wayne has in his head?

916
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,753
Riddle me this:

917
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,272
What kind of man...

918
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,431
...has bats on the brain?

919
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,600
- Go ahead. You can say it.
- You're a genius.

920
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,034
Oh, stop.

921
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,431
So, from this day on...

922
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,712
...Batman is no more.

923
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,473
You can't just quit.

924
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:41,837
There's monsters out there.
Batman has to protect the innocent.

925
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:45,356
I've dedicated my life to helping strangers
I've never met.

926
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,711
Faces I've never seen.

927
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,195
Well...

928
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:52,109
...the innocent aren't faceless anymore.

929
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,758
You can't tell me what to do
with the rest of my life.

930
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,798
My dad told me that every man goes
his own way.

931
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:00,876
My way goes to Two-Face.

932
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,872
You must help me.

933
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:05,351
And if you do find Harvey...

934
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,033
...and then you kill him...

935
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,314
...what next?

936
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,035
Exactly.

937
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,955
Then you'd be alone, like me.

938
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,552
No, you must let this go.

939
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,718
Listen to me, I'm your friend.

940
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,268
I don't need a friend, I need a partner.

941
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,352
Two-Face has got to pay.

942
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:29,835
Please.

943
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,310
Chase is coming for dinner.
I'm going to tell her...

944
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,434
...everything.

945
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,437
Come upstairs. We'll talk.

946
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:57,791
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

947
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,994
Happy Halloween.

948
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:01,832
Happy Halloween to you.

949
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:39,111
I asked you here tonight because
there's something I wanted to tell you.

950
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:42,150
I wanted to tell you something too.

951
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,828
What I wanted...

952
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:46,558
Go ahead, you first.

953
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:52,753
Trick or treat!

954
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,676
All my life I have been...

955
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,749
...attracted to a certain kind of man.

956
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:01,108
The wrong kind.

957
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,875
Look at what I do for a living.

958
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,319
And since...

959
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,476
...since I met you, I...

960
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,108
Oh, God.

961
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,312
Why am I so nervous?

962
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:27,509
Don't eat too much tonight
or you'll be sick in your beds.

963
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,272
Happy Halloween!

964
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,073
What's wrong?

965
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:16,513
It's happening again.

966
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:17,828
Flashes.

967
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,078
My parents' death.

968
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,589
Your memories are trying
to break through.

969
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:25,557
I want to tell you something.

970
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:27,511
Something I've never told anyone.

971
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,828
It's all right.

972
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,758
It's all right. I'm here.

973
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:38,034
<i>I'm here.</i>

974
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,436
<i>The night of my parents' wake...</i>

975
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,509
<i>... the priest's words gave no comfort.</i>

976
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,559
<i>Of course.</i>

977
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,831
<i>There, on my father's desk...</i>

978
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,592
<i>... the red book.</i>

979
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,239
<i>His journal.</i>

980
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,591
<i>He'd written in it every day.</i>

981
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,675
<i>But now he'd never write in it again.</i>

982
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,273
<i>At that moment I knew...</i>

983
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,430
<i>... my life would never be the same.</i>

984
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,195
<i>I raced out into the storm...</i>

985
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,711
<i>... trying to outrun the rage.</i>

986
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:19,995
<i>The pain.</i>

987
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:22,319
<i>Then I fell.</i>

988
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:25,673
<i>I fell forever.</i>

989
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:29,551
<i>The cave was monstrous.</i>

990
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,075
<i>It must have been there for centuries.</i>

991
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,269
<i>And there...</i>

992
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,712
<i>... deep in the shadows...</i>

993
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:41,348
<i>... I saw...</i>

994
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,636
<i>It was coming toward me.</i>

995
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:49,119
<i>I was scared at first, but only at first.</i>

996
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:53,200
<i>The figure in the dark was my destiny.</i>

997
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,516
<i>It would change my life forever.</i>

998
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:03,031
<i>I would use its image to strike terror</i>
<i>into the hearts of those who did evil.</i>

999
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:07,392
<i>I would ensure what happened to me</i>
<i>would never happen to anyone else.</i>

1000
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,232
<i>I would have my revenge.</i>

1001
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,070
What are you trying to tell me?

1002
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,435
I'm...

1003
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,393
Twick or tweet!

1004
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,429
Trick.

1005
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:10,713
Remember the plan?

1006
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,552
Seize and capture.

1007
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:14,309
No killing.

1008
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,391
That goes double for you.

1009
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,911
If I was a superhero...

1010
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,591
...where would I hide?

1011
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:29,634
Spank me.

1012
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:44,429
<i>Intruder alert! Intruder alert!</i>

1013
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:49,436
Intruder alert! Intruder alert!

1014
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:50,868
Shut up!

1015
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:03,071
Now, that's impressive!

1016
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:21,956
It's always risky introducing
a tamed animal into the wild.

1017
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:39,195
They may have trouble adapting
to their new environment.

1018
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,790
Somebody tell the fat lady...

1019
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:19,678
...she's on in five.

1020
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:38,468
"Joygasm!"

1021
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:01,873
Get the girl!

1022
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,313
Don't kill him.

1023
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,758
If you kill him...

1024
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:27,958
...he won't learn nothing.

1025
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,353
Master Bruce!

1026
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,632
How are you, young man?

1027
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:16,793
You haven't called me that for a long time.

1028
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:18,832
Old habits die hard.

1029
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:21,079
Are you all right?

1030
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:23,028
Where's Chase?

1031
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:25,270
I'm afraid they've taken her.

1032
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,556
Master Dick has run away.

1033
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:30,031
The cave has been destroyed.

1034
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:32,951
And there's another riddle.

1035
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:44,953
I'm coming, my sweet.

1036
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:50,919
Like the jacket?

1037
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:53,151
It keeps me safe when I'm...

1038
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:55,038
...jogging at night.

1039
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:57,558
Batman will come for me.

1040
01:32:58,800 --> 01:32:59,994
Batman?

1041
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,712
Batman, you say?

1042
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:05,393
Coming for you?

1043
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:09,829
I'm...

1044
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:11,839
...counting on it.

1045
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:19,200
What is that? Where's it coming from?

1046
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:21,270
There!

1047
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,238
Who's doing that?

1048
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:24,959
The Riddler!

1049
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:28,998
"We're five little items of an everyday sort.

1050
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:33,068
"You'll find us all in a tennis court."

1051
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:34,595
In...

1052
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:36,159
A-E-l-O-U.

1053
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:38,275
Vowels.

1054
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:40,032
Not entirely unclever, sir.

1055
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:42,759
But what do a clock, a match,
chess pawns...

1056
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:46,116
...and vowels have in common?
What do these riddles mean?

1057
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:49,317
Every riddle contains a number
and they arrived in this order:

1058
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:50,753
13, 1, 8...

1059
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:52,836
...and 5.

1060
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,433
13, 1, 8 and 5.

1061
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:56,675
Meaning?

1062
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,478
Letters of the alphabet?

1063
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:00,478
Of course, 13 is M.

1064
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:03,638
1 would be A, 8 would be H
and 5 would be E.

1065
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:05,508
M-A-H-E.

1066
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,911
Perhaps 1 and 8 are 18.

1067
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,428
18 is R.

1068
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:13,669
M-R-E.

1069
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:17,235
How about...

1070
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:18,673
..."Mr. E"?

1071
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:20,990
- Mystery?
- Another name for mystery?

1072
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:22,035
Enigma.

1073
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:23,953
Mr. E. Nygma.

1074
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:25,954
Edward Nygma.

1075
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:30,194
Stickley's suicide was obviously
a computer-generated forgery.

1076
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:33,676
You really are quite bright,
despite what people say.

1077
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:36,316
Are all the Batsuits destroyed?

1078
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:41,116
All except the prototype with the sonar
modifications. But it's not tested.

1079
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:43,598
Tonight's a good night.

1080
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:57,355
What do you suggest? By sea...

1081
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:00,319
...or by air?

1082
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:06,269
Why not both?

1083
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:16,273
Who's your tailor?

1084
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:18,316
I took the liberty, sir.

1085
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:22,069
"R?"

1086
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:23,952
What's that stand for?

1087
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:26,755
Robin.

1088
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:30,913
Riddler and Two-Face can make
a pretty lethal combination.

1089
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,513
You could use a hand.

1090
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:34,751
Two against two are better odds.

1091
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:37,550
I can't promise I won't kill Harvey.

1092
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:40,355
"A man's got to go his own way."

1093
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:42,278
A friend taught me that.

1094
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:44,593
Not just a friend.

1095
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,319
A partner.

1096
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:21,792
He's not coming.

1097
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:23,793
Shut it down.

1098
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:35,870
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1099
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:42,948
Hey, go!

1100
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:14,315
A-14.

1101
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:20,516
Hit!

1102
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:21,510
Sweet!

1103
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:23,230
B-12.

1104
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:28,069
Hit!

1105
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,039
My favorite vitamin.

1106
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,397
That sinking feeling.

1107
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:42,874
I like this game.

1108
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:44,029
C-9.

1109
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:56,431
You sunk my battleship!

1110
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:58,468
Who, me?

1111
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:23,678
This is your captain speaking.

1112
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:27,673
Please return to your seats.
We will be experiencing turbulence.

1113
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:36,479
I got him!

1114
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:45,634
I hope they can find the little black box.

1115
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:30,069
Now...

1116
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,956
...the real game begins.

1117
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:43,118
Holy rusted metal, Batman!

1118
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:46,752
The ground, it's all metal.

1119
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:48,831
It's full of holes: holey.

1120
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:55,075
Wait!

1121
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:59,151
The whole island's moving!

1122
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:44,913
Looking for us?

1123
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:51,198
That was for my mother!

1124
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:52,669
My father!

1125
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:56,589
My brother!

1126
01:40:57,720 --> 01:40:59,278
And this is for me!

1127
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,670
Finally, justice is served!

1128
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:34,473
Let us die!

1129
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:45,434
You're a man after our own heart, son!

1130
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:47,472
I'll see you in hell!

1131
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:55,152
I'd rather see you in jail!

1132
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:01,276
Oh, good boy. Good boy.

1133
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:03,518
The Bat's taught you well.

1134
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:04,635
Noble.

1135
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,074
Stupid...

1136
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:07,999
...but noble.

1137
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:52,233
Riddle me this.

1138
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:54,273
Riddle me that.

1139
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:56,994
Who's afraid of the big black bat?

1140
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:59,718
No more tricks, Edward.

1141
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:01,633
Very well, then.

1142
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:07,679
Let's get real.

1143
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:10,429
Release Chase. This is between you
and me.

1144
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:11,555
And me...

1145
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:12,999
...and me!

1146
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:20,590
You've sucked Gotham's brain waves and
now you've devised a way to read minds.

1147
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:23,988
You betcha!

1148
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:28,199
Soon my little Box will be
on countless TV's around the world...

1149
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:31,388
...feeding me credit-card numbers...

1150
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:33,112
...bank codes...

1151
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:35,038
...sexual fantasies...

1152
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:37,231
...and little white lies.

1153
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:39,836
Into my head they'll go.

1154
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:41,991
Victory is inevitable.

1155
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:44,831
For if knowledge is power...

1156
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:47,472
...then a god...

1157
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:48,595
...am...

1158
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:50,709
...I!

1159
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:59,753
Was that over the top? I can never tell.

1160
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,719
By the way, I've seen your mind. Freak!

1161
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,357
Yours is the greatest riddle of all!

1162
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:11,432
Can Bruce Wayne and Batman
ever truly coexist?

1163
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:14,352
We'll find out today!

1164
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:18,199
But first, let's meet our contestants.

1165
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,838
Behind curtain...

1166
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:23,312
...number one...

1167
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:29,392
...the absolutely fabulous
Dr. Chase Meridian!

1168
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:32,238
She enjoys hiking, manicures...

1169
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:35,756
...and foolishly hopes to be the love
of Bruce's life.

1170
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:43,311
Behind curtain number two...

1171
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:48,630
..."Fatman's" one and only partner.

1172
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:50,957
This acrobat turned orphan...

1173
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:54,595
...likes Saturday-morning cartoons
and dreams of one day being...

1174
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:56,756
...bare-naked with a girl.

1175
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,396
And below these contestants...

1176
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:04,511
...my personal favorite:

1177
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:06,273
A watery grave.

1178
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,438
Just one little touch...

1179
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:13,877
...and five seconds later
these two players are...

1180
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:16,111
...gull feed on the rocks below.

1181
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:20,990
Not enough time to save them both.

1182
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:26,995
Which one will it be, Batman?

1183
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:28,434
Bruce's love?

1184
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:31,274
Or the Dark Knight's junior partner?

1185
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:37,072
There is no way for me to save them
or myself.

1186
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:39,910
It's all one giant death-trap.

1187
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:41,435
Judges?

1188
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:45,319
I'm sorry. Your answer must be
in the form of a question.

1189
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:47,072
But thank you for playing.

1190
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:48,036
Wait!

1191
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:50,793
I have a riddle for you.

1192
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:51,995
For me?

1193
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:54,954
Really?

1194
01:45:58,040 --> 01:45:59,268
Tell me.

1195
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:04,353
I see without seeing.

1196
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:07,873
To me, darkness is as clear as daylight.

1197
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:10,629
What am I?

1198
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,194
Please!

1199
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:15,871
You're as blind as a bat!

1200
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:17,629
Exactly.

1201
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:54,474
Bummer!

1202
01:47:56,360 --> 01:47:57,429
Thanks.

1203
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,791
All those heroics for nothing.

1204
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:15,553
No more riddles, no more curtains one
and two.

1205
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:17,478
Just plain curtains!

1206
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:21,431
Aren't you forgetting something?

1207
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:22,715
Your coin.

1208
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:26,312
You're always of two minds.

1209
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:29,551
Yes, of course. You're right.

1210
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:32,628
Emotion's always the enemy
of true justice.

1211
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:34,790
You've always been a good friend.

1212
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:20,669
Why?

1213
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:23,119
Why can't I...

1214
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:24,639
...kill you?

1215
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,718
Too many questions.

1216
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:31,753
Too many questions.

1217
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:33,788
Poor Edward.

1218
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:36,391
I had to save them both.

1219
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:39,519
You see, I'm both Bruce Wayne
and Batman.

1220
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:42,071
Not because I have to be.

1221
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:43,355
Now...

1222
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:45,791
...because I choose to be.

1223
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:12,393
Thank you for responding to my request
for a consultation, Dr. Meridian.

1224
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:13,954
Edward Nygma...

1225
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:17,795
...has been screaming for hours
that he knows the true identity...

1226
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:19,393
...of Batman.

1227
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:33,715
Edward?

1228
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:35,635
Who...

1229
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:37,434
...is it?

1230
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:42,156
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase.

1231
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:45,193
Do you remember me?

1232
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:48,718
How could I forget?

1233
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:52,271
Dr. Burton tells me...

1234
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:55,231
...you know who Batman is.

1235
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:59,078
I can't tell you if you don't say, "please."

1236
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:01,953
Edward, please.

1237
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:03,639
Who is Batman?

1238
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:07,429
I'm...

1239
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:09,119
...Batman.

1240
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:36,112
Your secret is safe.

1241
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:38,271
He is definitely a wacko.

1242
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:40,549
"Wacko?"

1243
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:42,432
Is that a technical term?

1244
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:44,115
Listen...

1245
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:49,630
...I won't need this anymore.

1246
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,514
Thank you for giving me a new dream.

1247
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:13,312
Don't work too late.

1248
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:43,750
