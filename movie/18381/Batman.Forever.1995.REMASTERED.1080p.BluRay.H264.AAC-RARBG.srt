1
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,180
永远的蝙蝠侠

2
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,180
要带个三明治吗?
Can I persuade you to take a sandwich?

3
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,510
我会买"外带"在车上吃
I'll get drive-through.

4
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,440
你想靠那正义使者来救你?
You're counting on the winged avenger to deliver you from evil...

5
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,620
是吧? 老兄!
...aren't you, my friend?

6
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,510
你要杀我吗?
Are you going to kill me?

7
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,440
那倒不一定  我们还没决定好
Maybe, maybe not. We're of two minds on the subject.

8
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,230
赌一把怎么样?
You a gambling man?

9
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,630
来丢铜板决定如何?
What say we flip for it?

10
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,060
有人生来是英雄  有人是狗熊
One man is born a hero, his brother a coward.

11
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,770
朱门酒肉臭  路有冻死骨
Babies starve, politicians grow fat...

12
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,900
黄钟毁弃  瓦斧雷鸣
...holy men are martyred, and junkies grow legion.

13
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,370
为什么?
Why?

14
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,000
为什么? 为什么? 为什么?
Why, why, why, why, why?

15
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,480
狗屎运!
Luck!

16
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,930
盲目愚蠢! 毫无理由的狗屎运
Blind, stupid, simple, doo-dah... clueless luck!

17
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,260
只有丢铜板才有公平可言
The random toss... is the only true justice.

18
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:35,000
看看你老兄这回运气如何?
Let's see what justice has in store... for you.

19
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,210
一切交给上帝吧!
It's like the touch of God.

20
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,790
等一下!
Wait, wait, wait.

21
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,550
你狗运不赖嘛!
Fortune smiles. Another day of wine and roses.

22
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,980
该喝啤酒吃披萨庆祝
In your case, beer and pizza.

23
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,780
喂! 我们该出发了
Out of here, guys!

24
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,520
-你说你会让我活命  -没错
-But you said you'd let me live! -Too true!

25
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,260
留你当活饵  引诱那只大蝙蝠  太酷了!
And so you shall! Nothing's better than live bait to trap a bat.

26
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,690
真精彩的出场
Hot entrance.

27
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,380
双面人吗?
Two-Face?

28
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,710
两名警卫丧生
2 guards are dead.

29
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,150
警方没料到他会挟持人质
He's holding a third hostage. Didn't see this one coming.

30
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,650
我们早该想到
We should have.

31
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,380
高谭市第二银行
The 2nd Bank of Gotham.

32
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,620
我逮捕他的两周年纪念
2nd anniversary of the day I captured him.

33
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,390
难怪他要再犯案
How could he resist?

34
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,820
我是梅慈丝
I'm Chase Meridian.

35
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,060
我请她担任本案顾问  她是...
I asked her to come to here to consuIt on the case. She specializes in--

36
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,800
心理学  多重人格理论专家  我早已拜读大作
Psychology, multiple personalities. I read your work.

37
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,100
见解独到!
Insightful.

38
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,900
很天真  不过见解独特!
Naive, but insightful.

39
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,500
真令我受宠若惊
I'm flattered.

40
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,010
不是每个女人都能有此殊荣的
Not every girl makes a superhero's night table.

41
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,170
能跟他讲道理吗?
Can we reason with him?

42
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,140
-他手里有人质  -和他谈判有用
-He's got innocent people up there. -It won't do any good.

43
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,220
-这家伙杀人不眨眼  -我同意
-He'll slaughter them without a thought. -Agreed.

44
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,550
心灵的重创令他人格产生分裂
A trauma powerful enough to create an alternate personality leaves one--

45
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,790
社会的规则秩序完全置之不理
In a world where normal rules of right and wrong no longer apply.

46
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,820
完全正确
Exactly.

47
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,960
就像你一样
Like you.

48
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,490
我可以好好写一本书来探讨
I could write a hell of a paper

49
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,930
一个男人为何穿得像啮齿动物
on a grown man dressing like a flying rodent.

50
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,230
蝙蝠不是啮齿动物  梅医生
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.

51
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,500
真的? 这我倒不知道
Really? I didn't know that.

52
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,970
你真有意思
You are interesting.

53
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,690
叫我慈丝
And call me Chase.

54
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,850
对了  你贵姓?
By the way, do you have a first name,

55
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,440
或者我可以称你蝙蝠吗?
or do I call you Bats?

56
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,160
让我们玩个痛快吧?
Start the party with a bang!

57
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,140
连送死都这么准时
Very punctual, even for his own funeral. Boys!

58
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,840
兄弟们  宰了他!
Kill the Bat!

59
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,840
开枪!
Blast him!

60
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,080
芝麻开门!
Open sesame.

61
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,960
这是陷阱!
It's a trap!

62
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,740
各位亲爱的高谭市民请注意
Attention citizens of fair Gotham!

63
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,050
等我们开了保险箱
When we open that safe,

64
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,820
什么就都有了
we'll have everything we ever wanted...

65
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,300
足够让高谭市天下大乱
...enough cash to rain down upon fair Gotham a glorious flood of chaos.

66
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:17,110
当然  你这龟儿子是死定了
And, of course... you, my boy, dead!

67
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,800
那是强酸液体
It's boiling acid!

68
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,720
为了让你死得愉快
For your dying pleasure,

69
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,310
请享用美味大补汤
we are serving the acid that made us the men we are!

70
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,740
抓牢了
Hold on.

71
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,530
吊走
Haul away!

72
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,750
快吊走
Yes! Haul away!

73
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,010
手给我
Give me your hand.

74
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,480
别放手哇!
Don't let go!

75
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,930
这东西给我
I must borrow this.

76
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,330
那是我的助听器
That's my hearing aid!

77
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,550
谢谢
Thanks.

78
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,340
天啊  我的鞋子要溶化了
Wow! My shoes are melting!

79
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,420
救命!
No more!

80
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,510
抓紧了
Hang on.

81
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,860
抓紧?
Hang on?

82
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,270
快让他下来
Get him down. Get him down.

83
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,970
快  小心点
Take it easy with him.

84
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,550
你没事的
You'll be all right.

85
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,640
放轻松
Just stay calm.

86
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,630
小心! 让他慢慢下来

87
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,760
这下他没救了!
This'll fix him!

88
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,750
抓牢啊!
Hang on!

89
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,560
我来仔细瞧瞧
Let's see.

90
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,020
太棒了!
Yes!

91
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,740
是...多么快乐的一天
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Oh, happy day!

92
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:02,850
向那只尖耳的夜行鼠辈永别了
Farewell forever to that... pointy-eared night rat!

93
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,020
双面人
Face!

94
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,530
你需要心理治疗  投降吧!
You need help. Give it up.

95
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,060
这次让你死得有点品味
Have the good taste to die!

96
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,340
再见了
See you!

97
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,840
尽管昨晚蝙蝠侠奋不顾身追捕
Despite a valiant effort last night by Batman...

98
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,840
危险人物双面人仍侥幸逃脱
...Harvey Two-Face is still at large and extremely dangerous.

99
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,310
其他新闻方面
And another news today...

100
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,320
富豪布鲁斯韦恩将利润分红
...billionaire Bruce Wayne extended his profit-sharing program...

101
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,590
奖励企业内电子部门员工
...to the employees of the successful electronics branch of Wayne Enterprises.

102
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,090
韦恩先生
Mr. Wayne.

103
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,170
大驾光临  本部门无上光荣
Your inspections are a departmental highlight.

104
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,670
天啊  是他
Oh, my God, it's him.

105
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,340
勇敢一点  勇敢一点
I am a winner. I am a winner.

106
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,250
不要紧张
I am a winner.

107
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,840
勇敢一点
I am a winner.

108
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,390
这是最新科技生化治疗器
Bioremediation. Alternative fuel.

109
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,320
韦恩先生  时候不早了
Mr. Wayne, look at that time.

110
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,550
请到研发部参观吧
Perhaps we should get to R & D as soon as possible.

111
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,980
你是...
Mister...?

112
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,500
奥! 布鲁斯韦恩
Oh, Bruce Wayne.

113
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,440
那是我  阁下是?
No, that's my name. And you are?

114
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,740
尼格玛
Nygma.

115
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,040
艾德华
Edward.

116
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,970
是您亲自雇用我的
Edward Nygma. You hired me personally.

117
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,210
我都这么告诉别人
Just like I tell everyone.

118
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,110
事实上我们倒没见过面
We've never actually met,

119
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,240
不过你的名字在我雇用合约上
but your name was on the hiring slip. I have it.

120
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,480
请把手还我
I need that hand.

121
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,490
奥  是的
Oh, yes, of course.

122
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,020
抱歉
I'm sorry.

123
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,900
因为您是
It's just that...

124
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,960
您是我的偶像...
...you're my idol.

125
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,230
去工作
Get to work.

126
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,770
有人一直不肯让我们见面
And some people have been trying to keep us apart.

127
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,430
回去工作
Back to work.

128
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,870
没关系
It's okay.

129
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,940
你在想什么?
What's on your mind?

130
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,410
完全正确
Precisely.

131
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,740
我们都在想些什么?
What's on all our minds?

132
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,760
脑波...
Brain waves.

133
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:34,320
韦恩企业集团未来希望之所系
The future... of Wayne Enterprises... is brain waves.

134
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,960
真抱歉  韦恩先生
I must apologize, Mr. Wayne.

135
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,630
我今天终止了他的研究计划
I terminated his project today.

136
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,030
没关系
It's okay.

137
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,800
我这边有
I have it!

138
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,270
我的发明
My invention...

139
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:57,750
将电视讯号发射入人脑中
...beams any TV signal directly into the human brain.

140
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,550
借刺激中子以操控脑波
By stimulating neurons, manipulating brain waves...

141
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,220
这机器可让他电视观众
...this device makes the audience

142
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,860
仿佛成为剧中人物身历其境
feel like they're inside the show.

143
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,530
完全忘却俗世纷扰
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world?

144
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:14,520
你刚刚说"操控脑波"吗?
Did you say "manipulating brain waves?"

145
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,220
是的
Yes.

146
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,140
不过...
But...

147
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,240
像您这种大人物不会需要的
...someone like you would never need it.

148
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:31,010
如此聪明  机智  迷人的名人
Someone so... intelligent, witty and... charming.

149
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,920
我需要资金来作人体实验
I need a bit of additional funding for human trials.

150
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,020
来  我来示范
Let me show you, please!

151
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,960
我要看详细的设计计划
Now, listen... I want a full set of schematics on this, okay?

152
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,830
布鲁斯  我们会成为合作伙伴
We'll be full partners in this, Bruce.

153
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,330
你看  我们是天生最佳拍挡
Look at us! Two of a kind!

154
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,840
打电话给我助理  她会安排
You call my assistant, Margaret. She'll set something up.

155
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,590
很明显  你在敷衍我
That's not... going to be good for me.

156
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,940
给我一个肯定的答案
I need an answer now.

157
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,310
这是我该得的
I think I deserve it.

158
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:02,750
抱歉  你的要求恕难同意
I'm sorry, then the answer is no.

159
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,180
干扰人类脑波
Tampering with people's brain waves...

160
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,620
思想操控机器
...mind manipulation...

161
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,790
恐怕会引起轩然大波
...it just raises too many questions.

162
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,070
抱歉
Sorry.

163
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,420
多谢大家  谢谢你们的努力
Thanks, keep up the good work. Looks great.

164
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,730
好了  各位
All right, everyone!

165
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,330
继续工作
Back to work!

166
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,000
等一下再跟你算帐
We'll discuss this later!

167
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,650
你怎么可以让我失望
You were supposed to understand.

168
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:35,220
我会让你认识清楚
I'll make you understand.

169
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,040
锁上
Lock.

170
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,650
启动
Chair.

171
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,970
讯号收到
I saw the signal.

172
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,880
一切准备就绪
All is ready.

173
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,390
局长  他人呢?
Commissioner?

174
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,880
他回家了
He's home.

175
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,620
是我发的讯号
I sent the signal.

176
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,680
怎么回事?
What's wrong?

177
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,070
昨晚我注意到双面人一件事
Last night I noticed something about Two-Face:

178
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,690
他的铜板
his coin.

179
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,440
那是他的弱点
It's his Achilles' heel.

180
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,140
可以好好研究一下
It can be exploited.

181
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,970
我知道了
I know.

182
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,910
你叫我来就为了这个?
You called me for this?

183
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,580
我的呼叫器可不是BB机
The Batsignal is not a beeper.

184
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:11,300
你对我的吸引力不只在公事上
I wish I could say that my interest in you was... purely professional.

185
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,820
你在挑逗我吗?
You trying to get under my cape?

186
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,420
女人整天研究精神病很寂寞的
A girl can't live by psychoses alone.

187
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,860
是那部车吧? 马子喜欢搔包车
It's the car, right? Chicks love it.

188
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,030
为什么坏男人总是吸引着我
What is it about the wrong kind of man?

189
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,230
高中时是戴耳环的痞子
In grade school: guys with earrings.

190
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,470
大学是骑机车  穿皮夹克的
College: motorcycles, leather jackets.

191
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,720
现在嘛...
Now...

192
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,740
黑色橡皮衣的男子
...black rubber.

193
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,930
试试救火员  脱衣服比较方便
Try a fireman. Less to take off.

194
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,670
这我不在乎
I don't mind the work.

195
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,850
只可惜看不到你的真面目
Pity I can't see behind the mask.

196
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,650
每个人都戴着面具过日子
We all wear masks.

197
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,590
我的生命是本打开的书
My life's an open book.

198
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,090
想看看吗
You read?

199
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,630
我不想在人家家里野餐
I don't blend in at a family picnic.

200
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:58,990
我们可以试试  我会准备酒
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine...

201
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,360
你带着你受创的灵魂前来
...you bring your scarred psyche.

202
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,440
你很主动  是吧?
Direct, aren't you?

203
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,040
你喜欢主动的女人
You like strong women.

204
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,780
我对你研究过
I've done my homework.

205
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,710
还是要我穿紧身衣带皮鞭?
Or do I need skintight vinyl and a whip?

206
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,450
我对女人向来不在行
I haven't had much luck with women.

207
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:18,400
也许是对象不适合
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman.

208
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,460
我收到了讯号
I saw the signal.

209
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,460
怎么呢?
What's going on?

210
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,160
没事
Nothing.

211
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,500
真的没事
False alarm.

212
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,030
是吗?
Are you sure?

213
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,260
女人啊!
Women.

214
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,950
成功了!
Now I've got it!

215
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,150
轩然大波  引起轩然大波
Too many questions. There's too many questions.

216
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,610
轩然大波...
Too many....

217
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,380
我就证明给你看
I'll show you it works!

218
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,780
你到底在胡搞什么
What the hell is going on here?!

219
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,820
这个计划已经被终止
I told you this project is terminated!

220
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,070
我要叫警卫来
I'm calling security!

221
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,870
咖啡因有碍你健康
Caffeine will kill you!

222
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,900
天鼠先生  醒来吧
Rise and shine, little guinea pig.

223
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,500
你在干嘛!
What are you doing?

224
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,840
快放了我
Untie me!

225
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,610
反正又不会痛
This won't hurt.

226
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,280
至少我是这样认为
Least, I don't think it will.

227
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,610
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

228
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:49,680
你敢碰那开关...
You touch that switch and--

229
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,180
这个吗?
This?

230
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,230
画面不见了
Losing resolution.

231
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,790
能量加强
More power!

232
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,000
艾德华尼格玛
Edward Nygma!

233
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,830
请准备上场
You're the next contestant on...

234
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:40,470
脑力激荡超级秀
...Brain Drain!

235
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:45,430
我选看起来笨头笨脑的1号
I'll take what's inside thick skull number one!

236
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,110
他能得到什么大奖
What have we got for him?

237
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:52,310
史帝雷  这是我研究的大突破
Oh, Stickley, I'm having a breakthrough!

238
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,950
你准备抓狂吧
And a breakdown!

239
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,380
反正我是个大天才
Nevertheless, I'm smarter. I'm a genius.

240
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,490
不对  是超级天才
No, several geniuses.

241
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:05,460
比弗洛依德还厉害的旷世奇才
A gaggle, a swarm... a flock of freaking Freuds!

242
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,930
猜猜看
Riddle me this, Fred.

243
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,330
什么东西对一个人很重要
What is everything to someone...

244
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,770
对别人却微不足道?
...and nothing to everyone else?

245
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,970
是您老兄的智力
Your mind, baby!

246
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,510
现在我俩智力将彼此共享
Now mine pumps with the power of yours!

247
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,340
你的智慧归我所有
I'm sucking up your lQ

248
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,230
我会把你的大脑皮质
Vacuuming your cortex

249
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,740
吸得一干二净
Feeding off your brain

250
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,420
太刺激了!
What a rush!

251
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,400
发生什么事?
What just happened?

252
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,850
一点小小的副作用
A very surprising side effect.

253
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,790
当您沉醉在我的立体电视之时
While you were mesmerized by my 3-D TV...

254
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,090
我用你中枢能量让我更聪明了
...l used your neural energy to grow smarter.

255
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,830
大老板说得没错
Bruce Wayne was right!

256
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,130
你这个疯子  怪胎
You demented, bizarre, unethical toad!

257
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,500
这是非法脑波干扰
It is brain manipulation!

258
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,900
我要检举你
I'm reporting you to the FCC!

259
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,740
非法从事人体实验!
The human experimentation board! The AMl!

260
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,840
我会向警方报告
And the police!

261
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,080
你准备坐牢吧!
You are going up on charges...

262
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,110
我看你也得进疯人院
...to court, to jail... and then to a mental institution forever!

263
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,350
你现在就被开除了! 滚吧!
But, first and foremost, Nygma, you are fired!

264
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,640
听到吗? 快滚吧!
Do you hear me? Fired!

265
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,520
那可不一定
I don't think so.

266
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,100
救命啊!
Help!

267
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,130
抓紧啊!
Hang on!

268
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,160
老兄!
Babe!

269
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,560
你被开除了!
You are fired!

270
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,530
或者该说是...
Or should I say...

271
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,480
被"终结"了?
...terminated?

272
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,600
再见了  蠢才
Surf's up, Big Kahuna!

273
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,310
姿势不错  可惜落水不佳
Nice form, but rough on the landing.

274
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,910
大概只能得铜牌
He may have to settle for the Bronze.

275
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,260
猜个谜语  韦恩先生
Questions, Mr. Wayne?

276
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:45,300
我的实验会造成轩然大波
My work raises too many questions.

277
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:51,110
怎么没人给你好好上一课呢?
Why hasn't anybody... put you in your place?

278
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,670
前任高谭市首席检察官丹特
Harvey Dent, once Gotham's District Attorney...

279
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:59,110
在法庭上遭黑社会以毒液毁容
...was horribly scarred by underworld kingpin, Boss Moroni.

280
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,210
蝙蝠侠曾企图阻止不及
Although Batman tried to save him...

281
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,510
丹特左半脸严重毁损
...Dent's left-brain damage

282
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:06,450
心理失衡导致他成为知名罪犯
turned him into a violent criminal...

283
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,520
并归咎蝙蝠侠誓言报复
...who blamed Batman and who has vowed to destroy him.

284
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,850
双面人现为超级要犯
Harvey Two-Face is extremely dangerous,

285
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:13,260
请大家提高警觉
repeat, extremely dangerous.

286
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,030
局长来电
That was the Commissioner.

287
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,850
公司里出意外了
There's been an accident at Wayne Enterprises.

288
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,520
死得真惨
Horrible way to die.

289
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,700
电眼监视器在那边
The surveillance cameras are down here.

290
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,400
我们会尽量努力搜索
We'll dredge the river, but with that current,

291
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,800
不过可能找不到尸体了
I doubt we'll find the body.

292
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,180
为什么?
Why?

293
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,400
天啊! 为什么
Oh, why?

294
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,690
我不敢相信!
I just can't believe it.

295
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,360
同事这么多年了
Two years working in the same office.

296
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:47,050
他和我情同父子  有如手足
He was like my father... my brother...

297
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:49,960
我俩简直就是哥儿们
...or a cousin that visits a lot.

298
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,320
艾德华  你要节哀
Get a grip, Edward.

299
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,470
我在他房间发现这个
I found this in my cubicle.

300
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,500
就是他亲笔写的
You'll find the handwriting matches his,

301
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,350
连遣词用字都一样
as does the sentence structure.

302
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,410
我无法再待在这里了
I couldn't possibly continue on here.

303
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:10,680
这么多痛苦的回忆
The memories....

304
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:14,590
这是昨晚的监视器记录
This is last night's security log.

305
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,980
那是史帝雷
There's Stickley.

306
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,770
事实很清楚了
Pretty cut and dry.

307
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,560
别矣! 这个残酷的世界!

308
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,250
确实是自杀无疑
Yes, definitely suicide.

309
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:36,070
谢谢您合作  我们会保持联络
Thanks very much for your help, Bruce. We'll be in touch.

310
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,750
史帝雷自杀毫无道理
Stickley's suicide doesn't make sense.

311
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,850
全额保险给付给他家庭
I want full benefits for his family.

312
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,260
可是自杀死亡保险不理赔
Suicide's not covered by our policy.

313
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,920
我知道  全额给付
I know. Full benefits.

314
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,160
记者一直打电话来询问
Gossip Gerty called 32 times.

315
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,090
你准备带谁参加慈善马戏表演
Who are you taking to the Charity Circus?

316
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,970
我决定了会告诉你  这是什么
I'll let you know. What's this?

317
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,420
不知道
I don't know.

318
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,370
不知是谁送来的
I didn't see anyone.

319
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,150
看着我脸上的数字
"If you look at the numbers on my face...

320
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,960
你永远找不到13
"...you won't find 13 anyplace."

321
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,910
真恶心
That's hideous.

322
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,510
这什么意思
What does it mean?

323
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,320
这个是谜语
It's a riddle.

324
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,160
脸上的数字...13
"Numbers on my face...13."

325
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,560
一到十二
1 through 12.

326
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,610
答案是时钟
The answer is a clock.

327
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:28,330
谁会没事送个谜语给你?
Who would send you a riddle?

328
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:31,440
这个嘛...倒也是个谜
That, Maggie... is the riddle.

329
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,980
猜猜我今天干了什么好事
Guess what I did today?

330
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,070
韦恩大老板
Wayne Manor.

331
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,710
走着瞧
See you soon.

332
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,570
我约了梅博士  谢谢
Dr. Meridian, please. Thank you.

333
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,460
我...大概来早了
I... guess I'm early.

334
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:08,310
我和你约了时间
I have an appointment.

335
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,300
我是布鲁斯韦恩
I'm Bruce Wayne.

336
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,470
太好了  那你可以赔我一扇门
Good. You can afford a door.

337
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,790
抱歉
I'm sorry.

338
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:23,950
我在外面听到声音...
You...sounded like you were in...

339
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:29,160
以为你有什么麻烦
...you know, trouble.

340
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,290
这是我宣泄暴力的方式
I prefer healthy expressions of violence

341
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,170
以免我把门给拆了
as opposed to breaking in.

342
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,570
好吧
So...

343
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,880
有什么可效劳的吗?
...how can I help you?

344
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,270
有人不断寄情书给我
Someone's been sending me love letters.

345
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:49,480
一封寄到办公室  一封寄到家
One at my office and one at my home.

346
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,710
戈登局长说可以听听您的高见
Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your opinion.

347
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:58,640
时钟
A clock.

348
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,250
时钟
Clock.

349
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,060
把我折断  摩擦我的头
"Tear one off and scratch my head...

350
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:11,320
红头随后成黑头
"...what once was red is black instead."

351
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,270
火柴
A match.

352
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,470
我看这家伙是个狂人
My opinion: this letter writer is a wacko.

353
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,820
狂人?
Wacko?

354
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,150
心理学名词吗?
That a technical term?

355
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:32,020
典型患者具有沉迷杀人之倾向
Patient may suffer from obsession... with potential homicidal tendencies.

356
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,930
够专业吗?
Is that better for you?

357
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,530
所以基本上你认为...
So, what you're saying is...

358
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,460
这家伙是个疯子
...this guy's a total wacko.

359
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,330
完全正确
Exactly.

360
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,430
他疯狂地对你着迷
He's obsessed with you.

361
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:45,770
只有摧毁偏执对象能自我救赎
His only escape may be to purge the fixation.

362
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,500
就是把我宰了
To kill me.

363
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:51,300
看不出来你还蛮有概念的
I think you understand obsession better than you let on.

364
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,380
喜欢蝙蝠吗?
You like bats?

365
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,810
那是一种心理测验
That's a Rorschach, Mr. Wayne.

366
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,490
又称墨迹测验
An inkblot.

367
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,250
人们只被想看的墨点所吸引
People see what they want.

368
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,310
问题在于  你喜欢蝙蝠吗?
The question is, do you like bats?

369
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,850
你还在玩这个?
Still playing with dolls?

370
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,600
她是马来人的守护神
She's a Malaysian dream warden.

371
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,240
他们相信她能让你不做恶梦
Some cultures believe she protects you from bad dreams.

372
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,620
你一定觉得有点可笑
It's silly to you, I'm sure.

373
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,780
你看起来不太好
You look so sad.

374
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,910
需要一个娃娃吗?
Do you need one?

375
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,720
我? 谢了  有此必要吗?
Me? No. Why would I?

376
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:40,130
你看起来十分心神不宁
You're not exactly what you seem, are you?

377
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,840
你到底为什么来此找我?
What is it you really came here for?

378
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,200
呃  时间到了
Yikes, time's up.

379
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,100
通常这句话该由我来说
That's usually my line.

380
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,740
我真希望能再多聊会儿
I'd love to stay here chatting.

381
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,270
真的吗?
Would you?

382
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,110
我可不太相信
I'm not so sure.

383
00:32:56,110 --> 00:33:00,750
我希望你把这身衣服脱掉
I must get you out of those clothes.

384
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,050
什么?
Excuse me?

385
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:04,350
换上黑色晚礼服
And into a black dress.

386
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,950
医生  你喜欢马戏表演吗?
Tell me, doctor, do you like the circus?

387
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:11,860
巨蛋体育馆   高谭市马戏慈善表演

388
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,860
各位先生  各位先生
Ladies and gentlemen...

389
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,500
各位小朋友
...boys and girIs of all ages...

390
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,120
欢迎观赏全世界最伟大的表演
...welcome to the greatest show on earth!

391
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,020
这位高贵的女士是谁?
Who is this beautiful young woman you're with?

392
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,550
梅慈丝医师
Dr. Chase Meridian.

393
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,820
医师?
A doctor?

394
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,350
那一种医生?
What kind of doctor?

395
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,720
门票收入将捐给市立儿童医院
...for Gotham Children's Hospital.

396
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,230
让我们感谢最高金额捐款人
Let's thank our largest single donor:

397
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,520
布鲁斯韦恩
Bruce Wayne!

398
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,840
各位女士先生
Ladies and gentlemen...

399
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,610
将在离地七十尺高空中
...70 feet above the ground...

400
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:00,140
表演令您叹为观止的特技
...performing feats of unimaginable aerial skill...

401
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,720
空中飞人葛瑞森家族!
...the Flying Graysons!

402
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,450
我周末要去攀岩
Listen.... I'm going rock climbing this weekend. Would you join me?

403
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,680
呃! 我很想去
I'd like to.

404
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,150
我喜欢攀岩  真的
I love climbing. I really love it.

405
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,760
但是?
But?

406
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,670
我有对象了
I've met someone.

407
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:14,290
那可真快  你才刚搬来不久
That's fast work. You just moved here.

408
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:18,660
就像一时天雷勾动地火...
You could say he... dropped out of the sky and...

409
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,390
一发不可收拾
...bang!

410
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,760
我觉得对方也同样来电
I think he feIt it too.

411
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,100
他的确如此
He sure did.

412
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,830
什么?
What?

413
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,290
谁抗拒得了呢?
Who wouldn't?

414
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:37,010
接下来由飞人家族最年轻成员
Now... Richard... the youngest flying Grayson...

415
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:41,660
李查表演惊心动魄的死亡翻滚
...will perform the awe-inspiring... death drop...

416
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,710
安全网将全部撤走
...without the safety... of a net!

417
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,310
上场了
Let's go.

418
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,660
别紧张
You'll be okay.

419
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:47,130
各位女士先生
Ladies... and gentlemen!

420
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,850
新任马戏班主任现在请大家
Now, the new management of the circus invites you to forget...

421
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:53,720
暂时忘记这些有趣的表演
...this good, wholesome fun...

422
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,360
一起加入我们的混乱之夜
...and join us in a celebration of chaos...

423
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,610
拿上来
...and true jesters!

424
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:02,150
快点
Bring it on! Now!

425
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,980
今晚我们准备了新点子
Tonight, a new act for your...

426
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,040
叫做巨蛋大屠杀
...personal amazement. We call it Massacre under the Big Top.

427
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:25,660
请注意场中可爱的大圆球
Let us direct your attention to the ring.

428
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:31,430
其中装了两百管TNT炸药
Inside this harmless-looking orb are two... that's two hundred sticks of TNT.

429
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:37,920
遥控引爆信管就在我手中
And in our innocent hand... a radio detonator.

430
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,940
你到底要怎样?
What do you want?

431
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,610
要怎样? 市长先生?
Want, Mr. Mayor?

432
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,610
我只要一个人-蝙蝠侠
One simple thing: Batman.

433
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,280
我要他肝脑涂地  血流五步
Bruised, broken, bleeding...

434
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,570
简而言之  要他死!
...in a word: dead!

435
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,280
蝙蝠侠
Batman.

436
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,250
今晚在场的
Who do we have before us?

437
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,860
都是高谭市有头有脸的大人物
Gotham's finest... well-to-do...

438
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,330
一定有人知道蝙蝠侠是谁
...influential. Surely one of you knows who Batman is.

439
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:06,220
搞不好蝙蝠侠就在你们之中
Hell, odds are one of you pasty-faced twits is Batman!

440
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,830
给你们两分钟
You have two minutes.

441
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,420
双面人! 我就是蝙蝠侠
Harvey! I'm Batman!

442
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,540
我们来阻止他们
We can stop them.

443
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,870
快上去
Go out on the rigging.

444
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,900
小心
Be careful.

445
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,950
放心!
Don't worry.

446
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,060
上工了  小朋友们!
Go to work, boys!

447
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,060
今天真是个黄道吉日
Our kind of day.

448
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,810
快阻止它爆炸
Reach for it! Stop it!

449
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,770
天啊!
Oh, my God.

450
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,910
谢谢您收容他
It's good you took him in.

451
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,450
这孩子没有任何亲人了
He hasn't anyone now.

452
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,780
他整天都在写调查报告
He filled out papers all day.

453
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,620
不吃不喝
He hasn't slept or eaten.

454
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,930
欢迎您  葛瑞森主人
Welcome, Master Grayson.

455
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,480
我叫阿福
I'm Alfred.

456
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,030
你好  阿福
How you doing, Al?

457
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:52,540
您的房间准备好了
There's a room prepared for you.

458
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,310
或者您想先吃点东西
But perhaps you'd like to eat first.

459
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,870
好了  我要闪人了
Okay, I'm out of here.

460
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,400
什么?
Excuse me?

461
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:04,780
我骗条子我要住在这里
Telling that cop I'd stay here...

462
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,700
免得社工人员找我罗嗦
...saved me a lot of social service interviews.

463
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,540
谢了  我闪了  再见
So, no offense, but no thanks. See you.

464
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,330
保重了
Take it easy.

465
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,990
你上哪儿? 马戏团已经离开了
Where will you go? The circus must be halfway to Metropolis.

466
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,700
我要找到双面人
Get a fix on Two-Face.

467
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,530
亲手杀了他
Then I'll kill him.

468
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,950
杀了双面人不会让你远离痛苦
Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away.

469
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,520
只会越来越糟
It'll make it worse.

470
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,110
少跟我打屁  拜托!
Spare me the sermons, all right?

471
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,230
我不用你来说教或同情
I don't need your advice or your charity.

472
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,030
好酷的机车
Nice bike.

473
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:48,320
你也喜欢重型古董机车吗?
Hang out at a lot of biker bars?

474
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,350
你的油快没了
You're almost on empty.

475
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,170
到车库加满油再走吧
Fill it up in the garage.

476
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,390
方园十哩内可没有加油站
There's no gas station for miles.

477
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,910
加油枪在那儿
Pump's over here.

478
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,380
大哥  这是车库或汽车博物馆
Is this a garage or a car museum, Bruce?

479
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,560
一九一七年的哈雷
A 1917 Harley.

480
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,770
是的
Yep.

481
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,930
古典印地安型  完美如新
lndian Classic, fully restored.

482
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:25,600
这是文森黑骑士型
This is a Vincent Black Knight.

483
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,440
只生产了一百部
They only made 100.

484
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,770
其实是一百零一部  我的最爱
A hundred and one, actually. She's my favorite.

485
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:32,510
你竟然有两部
You've got two.

486
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,530
那一部故障了
That one doesn't run.

487
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:37,050
这一部的节流阀堵住了
Throttle sticks on this one.

488
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:39,150
阿福修车有一套
Alfred's a good mechanic, but...

489
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,820
不过这个工程浩大
...these need a lot of work.

490
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,590
谁能帮我修好它们
Someone were to fix them up...

491
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:45,350
我就送他一部
...they could keep one.

492
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,230
好了  祝旅程愉快
Anyway... have a nice trip.

493
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,440
我想你会一切如意的
You'll land on your feet.

494
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:00,000
小主人要走了吗? 真可惜
Is the young master leaving? Pity.

495
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,900
那我把食物倒掉喂狗了
I'll just toss this away then. Perhaps the dogs are hungry.

496
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,150
嘿  阿福  等等
Hey, Al, wait up.

497
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:09,630
嘿  阿福  等等
Hey, Al, wait up.

498
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:04,460
主人?
Master Bruce?

499
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,540
和我父母一样
Just like my parents.

500
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:13,520
悲剧又再重演
It's happening again.

501
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:16,570
怪物从黑暗中出现
A monster comes out of the night,

502
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:19,430
我听到尖叫  两声枪响
a scream, two shots.

503
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:21,910
我杀了他们
I killed them.

504
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,290
你说什么?
What did you say?

505
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:25,660
他杀了他们
He killed them.

506
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:26,960
双面人
Two-Face.

507
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,630
他杀了那孩子的父母
He slaughtered that boy's parents.

508
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:31,130
不! 不!
No, no.

509
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:34,980
你刚刚说"我杀了他们"
You said, "I killed them."

510
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:47,640
好好照顾那孩子
Take care of the kid.

511
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:49,060
知道了  主人
Certainly, sir.

512
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:00,460
要我帮您拿行李吗? 小主人
Can I help you settle in, Master Grayson?

513
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:04,310
不用  我一会儿自己来
No. Thanks, I won't be staying long.

514
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,910
这是知更鸟吗?
Is this a robin?

515
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,680
有一回我哥哥绳子断了
My brother's wire broke once

516
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,540
我荡出去及时抓住了他
and I swung out and grabbed him.

517
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,830
我老爸说我是大英雄
My father said I was his hero.

518
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:24,280
说我飞得活像只知更鸟
I flew in like a robin.

519
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,820
结果这英雄现在毫无用武之地
Some hero I turned out to be.

520
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:30,890
你父亲说得对
But your father was right.

521
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:34,080
你是个英雄  我感觉得到
You are a hero. I can tell.

522
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,840
请把这个丢了  我不需要它了
Throw this away, will you? I won't need it anymore.

523
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:49,300
我把它放在这里
I think I'll just put it in here.

524
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,480
折翼即将复原
Broken wings mend in time.

525
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,960
总有一天你会再度展翅高飞
One day Robin will fly again.

526
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:02,890
我保证
I promise.

527
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:26,690
我来开
We'll drive.

528
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,190
叫"谜语大师"如何?
The Puzzler?

529
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,600
叫"大老千"呢?
The Gamester?

530
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:16,370
"魔鬼杀手"呢?
Captain Kill?

531
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,030
"谜天大圣"呢?
Question Mark Man?

532
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:42,430
谢了  太感激了
Thank you. Thank you so much.

533
00:51:56,670 --> 00:52:00,910
怎样都动不了那蝙蝠一根汗毛
The Bat's stubborn refusal to expire...

534
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,090
简直令我抓狂
...is driving us insane!

535
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,770
别烦心了  宝贝
Don't worry, baby.

536
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,770
你马上可以宰了他
You'll kill him soon.

537
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:20,050
我替你准备了大餐
Besides... I made your favorite.

538
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:24,070
香槟  鲑鱼
Sparkling champagne and... yummy poached salmon with little quail eggs and a...

539
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:28,810
鹌鹑蛋
...creamy...

540
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:30,090
幻想
...dreamy...

541
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,950
还有香喷喷的柠檬蛋酥
...lemon souffle.

542
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:35,680
我这边的才叫做大餐
No, I made your favorite.

543
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,850
炭烤野猪心
A charred heart of black boar...

544
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:40,320
野驴肉
...a side of raw donkey meat...

545
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:45,490
还有不加冰的超级够劲烈酒
...and a Sterno and grain alcohol, straight up, baby!

546
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:47,920
太完美了
Perfect!

547
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,760
女士们  你们把我们宠坏了
Ladies, you spoil us!

548
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,200
我们还没决定先吃那一边
We're of two minds about what to eat first.

549
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,530
什么声音?
What?!

550
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:56,800
希望你有替我多留一份
I hope you made extra.

551
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,640
你到底是谁?
Who the hell are you?

552
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,860
只是一个朋友
Just a friend.

553
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,490
不过你可以叫我"谜天大圣"
But you can call me......The Riddler.

554
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,580
听起来像是死人名字
I'll call you dead, is more like it!

555
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,920
说  你怎么找到我们?
How did you find us? Talk!

556
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,050
我说了你会放了我吗?
But then if I talked what would keep you from slaying me, O Segregated One?

557
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:20,220
心眼小难怪脸永远好不了
That's never going to heal if you don't stop picking.

558
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:24,810
我倒要看看你的血是绿色的吗
Let's see if you bleed green.

559
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:27,770
你想杀的人可不是我
It's not me you want to kill.

560
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:33,480
取我小命对你们而言太容易了
That's just too easy for someone as powerful as you and... you.

561
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:39,380
杀了蝙蝠侠  那才够气派
But Batman... there's a challenge.

562
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:42,710
宰了那只蝙蝠  听起来不赖
Kill the Bat! Sounds like a good idea.

563
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:44,080
但你想过吗?
But have you thought it through?

564
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:48,350
几发子弹  血溅五步  然后呢
A few bullets, a splash of blood, then what?

565
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:51,290
只是弄脏你的手
Wet hands.

566
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:54,840
还会染上杀人后的忧郁症
Post-homicidal depression.

567
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,860
何不先侮辱他一番
Why not humiliate him first? Yeah.

568
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:03,900
找出他的弱点  在他最脆弱时
Expose his frailties. Then, when he is at his weakest...

569
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,500
给他致命一击
...crush him!

570
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:11,970
你的左眼正在闪闪发光
I see that... sparkle in your left eye.

571
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,350
我可以帮你逮到蝙蝠侠
I can help you get Batman.

572
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:23,940
不过你得饶了我这条小命
That is, if you'll... spare my life for just a few moments.

573
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:35,480
谢了
Thank you.

574
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,660
我喜欢你的装潢
I love what you've done here.

575
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:41,060
有后现代主义的风格
Heavy Metal meets House and Garden.

576
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:43,910
太美了
Beautiful.

577
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:49,270
一边是黑暗  野蛮  颓废
It's so dark and Gothic and... disgustingly decadent.

578
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,910
一边却如此明亮  活泼
Yet so bright and chipper and...

579
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,500
优雅保守
...conservative.

580
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,370
正是你的个性
It's so you!

581
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,690
完完全全的你
And yet, so you!

582
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,840
很少人能像你一样完美地
Very few people are both a summer and a winter, but...

583
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:14,550
融合了两种极端的品味
...but you pull it off nicely.

584
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:18,100
讲重点
What's the point?

585
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,620
有没有人告诉你
Has anyone ever told you

586
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:24,020
你有严重的乱抓狂毛病
you have a serious impulse-control problem?!

587
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:28,280
这就是重点
This is the point.

588
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:44,240
我来示范我是如何找到你的
This is how I found you. Let me demonstrate.

589
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:51,740
这是你的脑
This is your brain on the Box.

590
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,530
这是小弟我的脑
This is my brain.

591
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:57,050
有没有人还要玩吗?
Does anyone else feel like a fried egg?

592
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:58,680
我还要再玩
I'll have more.

593
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,010
没问题  不过要收费
There's more. But only the first one's free.

594
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:04,930
我们来谈条件
Here's the bargain:

595
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:07,670
你帮我找资金来生产这机器
You'll help me steal production capital...

596
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:10,800
我让城市每部电视都装上它
...so I can put a Box on every TV in town...

597
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:16,010
我就成了高谭市最聪明的生物
...and become Gotham's cleverest carbon-based life form!

598
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:19,270
为了报答你们...
And in return....

599
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:22,210
你们有听好吗?
Is everybody paying attention?

600
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:25,120
我会帮你解出世纪之谜
I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all.

601
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,230
有史以来最大的谜
The mother of all riddles:

602
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:32,070
蝙蝠侠是何方神圣
Who is... Batman?

603
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:36,200
你擅闯我秘密基地
You broke into our hideout.

604
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,870
破坏这块净土的圣洁
You violated the sanctity of our lair.

605
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:41,700
本该把你碎尸万段
We should crush your bones into powder.

606
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,970
不过看在你点子不错的份上
But you pose an interesting proposition.

607
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:46,310
丢铜板决定  大头朝上放了你
Therefore, heads, we accept,

608
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:48,130
字朝上你就认命受死吧
and tails, we blow your damn head off.

609
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,860
这一颗不错
Here's a good one.

610
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,620
不对不对
No, no, no!

611
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:09,770
这一颗更好
There is a good one.

612
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,730
放着就好  我来晾
Leave that. I'll attend to it.

613
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,990
我可不习惯被人伺候
I'm not used to being waited on.

614
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:42,130
不要开枪
Don't shoot me!

615
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:44,940
发什么楞  拿来
Don't eyeball me! Give me that!

616
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:50,870
双面人  教我怎么揍人
Two-Face, show me how to punch a guy!

617
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:54,040
简单得很  握拳  往后拉
It's dead simple, my boy. Ball up your fist, reach back...

618
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,600
再用力打出去
...and assert yourself.

619
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:59,460
有意思  我试试
That looks fun. Let me try.

620
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:03,930
握拳  往后拉  用力打出去
Ball up the fist, reach way back ...assert yourself.

621
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:11,300
十万零两百二十
One hundred thousand, two hundred and twenty.

622
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:13,980
十万零...
One hundred and....

623
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:15,380
又数乱了
I lost count!

624
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:21,640
昨夜绿衣抢匪再度犯案
Last night another robbery, perpetrated by the green-suited menace...

625
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,740
数百万元钻石遭窃
...resulting in millions in diamonds stolen,

626
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:25,580
蝙蝠侠并未出现
with no sign of Batman.

627

匪徒作案习惯在现场留下谜语
This new criminal's pattern of marking his crimes with puzzles...

628
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:33,490
市井间以"谜天大圣"称呼之
...has Gothamites calling him The Riddler.

629
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:37,120
显然他是你和蝙蝠侠的公敌
Apparently, you and Batman have a common enemy.

630
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,700
这是一早送来的新谜语
That was with the morning mail.

631
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:43,800
八条好汉勇往直前
"The eight of us go forth, not back,

632
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,100
不回头
to protect our king...

633
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,040
一心护主公
"...from attack."

体积小  重量轻

639
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,460
之间有何关联?
What's the connection?

640
00:58:56,610 --> 00:59:00,320
这就是他外号谜天大圣的原因
With all due respect, that's why they call him The Riddler.

641
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:04,850
有事要我效劳吗?
May I help you?

642
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:07,490
为什么只有这门上了锁?
Why is this the only locked door?

643
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:09,320
门后是什么?

00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:12,380
主人韦恩死去的太太
Master Wayne's dead wives.

645
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:15,400
那是放银器的柜子
The silver closet. On your way.

646
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:22,070
现在各位可以体验伟大的科技

649
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:32,520
各位  我们的理想

这魔幻宝盒享誉全美
The Box in every home in America...

651
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:39,110
即将风行全世界
...and one day, the world!

652
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:42,290
本地消息  艾德华的魔幻宝盒
In local news, Edward Nygma's 3-D Box...

653
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,960
已在本市掀起购买热潮

655
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:53,110
几乎全市每户皆有安装
There is hardly a home without the Nygma Tech Box.

656
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:57,010
评论家认为这是机械化的沉沦
Critics claim the Box turns Gothamites into zombies.

657
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,010
但艾德华本人有不同看法
But Edward Nygma just shrugs.

658
00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:01,820
电视发明时  他们也是这么说
"That's what they said when TV was invented."

659
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,390
小主人
Master Dick!

660
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:49,380
在这儿
Up here.

661
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:52,910
没什么事  小主人
Just checking, young sir.

662
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:26,400
遭非法闯入  注意!
Intruder alert. Intruder alert.

663
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:55,260
我有东西给你  在桌上
I have something for you. It's on the table.

664
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:57,480
希望你会喜欢
I hope you like it.

665
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,950
这是出于专业上的直觉
Call it clinical intuition.

666
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:14,140
你的梦境需要改变一下
l thought your dreams needed changing.

667
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:19,360
我父母在我眼前遭人杀害
My parents were murdered before me...

668
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,930
当时我只是个孩子
...when I was a kid.

669
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:28,670
详细经过我记不太清楚
I don't... remember a lot of what happened, but...

670
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:33,900
但在梦境中却历历在目
...what I do comes to me in my dreams. Flashes.

671
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:38,280
最近梦中却出现一些新的内容
There's a new element now though, I haven't seen before.

672
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:41,500
是一本红皮册子
It's a red leather book.

673
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:44,140
新的梦境
Something else....

674
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,120
甚至连我醒时都常会作这些梦
My dreams come to me when I'm awake now.

675
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,590
布鲁斯  这是你压抑下的记忆
Bruce, you're describing repressed memories.

676
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:57,750
记忆深处的痛苦会试着被释放
lmages of a forgotten pain that's trying to surface.

677
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,210
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

678
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:16,950
蝙蝠侠法外锄奸令人争议

679
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:22,220
精神分裂诊断书
Is there an aspect of your

680
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:23,880
关于你父母之死
parents' death you haven't faced?

681
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:25,860
是否有什么你不敢面对的
You were so young

682
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:28,010
当时你还很小
when it happened.

683
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:31,940
也许我该让你专心研究蝙蝠侠
Maybe I should leave you two alone.

684
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:36,520
这该不会只是把公事带回家吧
This goes way beyond taking your work home, doesn't it?

685
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:39,960
好吧
All right.

686
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,990
我承认他够刺激
I think he's fascinating.

687
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:46,080
心理学角度上的
Clinically.

688
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,440
为什么一个男人会这么做?
Why does a man do this?

689
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,190
仿佛受到诅咒般在赎罪
It's as if he's cursed to pay penance.

690
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:53,250
他到底犯了什么错
What crime could he have committed to

691
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:57,160
注定要在夜间出没受惩罚
deserve a life of nightly torture?

692
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:02,510
只是专业上的好奇吗? 慈丝?
It's more than just... professional interest, isn't it, Chase?

693
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:05,380
你在吃醋吗?
Bruce, are you jealous?

694
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:11,700
不  我无法吃蝙蝠侠的醋
No. I can't be jealous of Batman.

695
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:16,320
我想亲近你  你却拒人千里
I want to be close, but you won't let me near.

696
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:20,020
有什么不想让我知道的吗?
What are you protecting me from?

697
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:22,450
想知道原因吗?
Do you want to know me?

698
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:24,880
你知道我是谁吗?
Do you want to know who I am?

699
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:30,980
我想我们都有两种面貌
I guess... we're all two people.

700
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:36,700
外表所呈现的  和内心真实的自我
One daylight, and the one we keep in shadow.

701
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:41,200
愤怒  暴力  激情
Rage... violence... passion.

702
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:46,750
对不起
Excuse me.

703
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:49,680
我正在忙
I'm busy.

704
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:54,380
抱歉打扰你  小主人惹麻烦了
I'm sorry to bother you. I have some distressing news about Dick.

705
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:55,990
他还好吧?
Is he okay?

706
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:58,690
他出门了
I'm afraid Master Dick has gone traveling.

707
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:01,160
离家出走吗?
He ran away?

708
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:04,460
事实上  他把车开走了
Actually, he took the car.

709
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:06,460
把积架开走吗?
He boosted the Jag?

710
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:08,070
不是那部积架
Not the Jaguar.

711
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,570
另一部车
The other car.

712
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:10,900
班特利吗?
Bentley? No, sir.

713
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:14,970
不  主人  是"另外"一部车
The other car.

714
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,790
小妞们  要去兜兜风吗?
Go for a little ride in my love machine, babies?

715
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:55,050
是蝙蝠侠
It's Batman!

716
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:57,520
快开门  蝙蝠侠
Open up, Batman.

717
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:00,820
等等  他不是蝙蝠侠
Wait! That's not Batman!

718
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:02,390
你说什么?
What do you mean?

719
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:04,780
他是蝙蝠弟弟
That's Batboy!

720
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:07,080
不是蝙蝠侠本人嘛
It ain't the Bat!

721
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:31,140
放了她
Let her go!

722
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:41,130
你是什么东西?
Who the hell are you?

723
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,380
在下蝙蝠侠
I'm Batman.

724
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:48,100
我忘了穿蝙蝠装  不行吗?
I forgot my suit, all right?

725
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:28,440
快走
Come on, run!

726
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:31,660
蝙蝠侠不和女士吻别吗?
Doesn't Batman ever kiss the girl?

727
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:34,480
走!
Go!

728
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:36,650
谢了  你救了我
Thanks, you saved my life!

729
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:40,720
看来我天生是当超级英雄的料
I could definitely get into this superhero gig.

730
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:05,010
蝙蝠侠来了!
Batman!

731
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,900
你可恶!
Bastard!

732
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:21,900
我家人成了你的替死鬼
It should've been you!

733
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:25,170
当时你向双面人承认是你
If you had told Two-Face who you were at the circus...

734
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:28,200
他们就都不会死了
...they'd still be alive!

735
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:33,810
若能以布鲁斯韦恩的命来交换
If Bruce Wayne could've given his life for your family

736
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:35,200
他会乐意的
he would have.

737
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:44,570
我现在一心只想杀双面人
All I can think about every day is getting Two-Face.

738
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:47,860
他毁了我的一生
He took my whole life.

739
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,600
今晚我在干架时
When I was out there tonight...

740
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,240
都把对手当成是他
...I imagined it was him I was fighting...

741
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:57,230
连我在捶你时也一样
...even when I was fighting you...

742
01:08:57,270 --> 01:09:00,230
浑然忘了肉体的痛苦
...and the pain went away.

743
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,970
你了解吗?
Do you understand?

744
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:03,640
我了解
Yes, I do.

745
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:07,750
很好  你一定得帮我找到他
Good. You must help me find him.

746
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:08,940
那以后
When we do...

747
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:11,820
我要亲手宰了他
...I'm the one who kills him.

748
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:16,530
这是你一生的目标吗?
So, you're willing to take a life?

749
01:09:16,530 --> 01:09:19,790
是的  亲手杀了双面人
As long as it's Two-Face.

750
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:24,740
然后事情就像这样
Then it will happen this way:

751
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:30,970
你杀了双面人  痛苦却未远离
you make the kill. And your pain doesn't die with Harvey, it grows.

752
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:33,550
反而与日俱增
So you run into the night to find another face, and another...

753
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:37,880
夜复一夜  你不断借杀伐解脱
...and another...

754
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,250
直到有一天你醒来
...until one terrible morning you wake up and realize...

755
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:44,390
你将发现复仇成了生命的全部
...that revenge has become your whole life...

756
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:47,490
而你却无法自拔
...and you won't know why.

757
01:09:47,490 --> 01:09:49,530
你不了解
You can't understand.

758
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:53,400
你家人又没有被疯子杀掉
Your family wasn't killed by a maniac.

759
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:56,230
他们就是这么死的
Yes, they were.

760
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:58,100
我们同痛相怜
We're the same.

761
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:00,340
既然如此  请帮助我  训练我
If we're the same, help me. Train me,

762
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:02,390
我来做你的最佳拍档
let me be your partner.

763
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:05,710
不行
No.

764
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:10,250
你仍有选择余地
I can't. You still have a choice.

765
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:15,190
不管怎样  反正我跟定你了!
Look, Bruce... I'm a part of this, like it or not.

766
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:36,940
今晚本市社交界的盛会
Tonight all of Gotham society has turned out for Edward Nygma's...

767
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:40,660
艾德华将发表魔幻宝盒第二代
...gala unveiling of his New lmproved Box.

768
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:43,150
谢了  阿福
Thanks, Al.

769
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:44,250
不客气
My pleasure, sir.

770
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,090
名人们将畅饮狂舞
They'll be dining and dancing the night away...

771
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:50,120
享受高谭亚都饭店的顶楼夜色
...on the glamorous roof of the Ritz Gotham.

772
01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:04,670
成了杂志的封面人物有何感想
What's it like to have your face on the cover of every magazine?

773
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:09,810
身为本市最有身价的单身汉
Edward, how does it feel to be the city's newest,

774
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:11,910
你感觉如何?
most eligible bachelor?

775
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:14,420
想必十分新鲜
Gotham must know!

776
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:16,890
布鲁斯韦恩来了
There's Bruce Wayne!

777
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:18,650
老布!
Brucie!

778
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:21,890
天啊! 他太帅了
Oh, Eddie, he is too cute!

779
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:25,300
你怎么没他那么帅
How come you don't look so good in that suit?

780
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:28,260
闭嘴  你有任务在身
Shut up. You're here to work!

781
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:29,430
我的痣怎么样
How's my mole?

782
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:30,330
很好
Fine.

783
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:34,100
谣传艾德华有意收购韦恩集团
What about rumors of a Nygma Tech takeover of Wayne Enterprises?

784
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:37,370
尼格玛股票是韦恩集团的两倍
Nygma Tech stock is outselling Wayne Enterprises 2 to 1 .

785
01:11:37,370 --> 01:11:40,080
布鲁斯  你的公司过气了吗?
Are you yesterday's news, Bruce?

786
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:43,510
布鲁斯老公公
Bruce, old man.

787
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:46,750
新闻界想知道被形容成
The press wonders what it's like to be outsold, outclassed, out-coiffed and...

788
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:51,830
落伍  过气  明日黄花的感觉
...generally outdone in every way.

789
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:54,990
艾德华  恭喜了
Hello, Edward. Congratulations.

790
01:11:54,990 --> 01:11:58,230
派对真热闹  好看的西装
Great party. Nice suit.

791
01:11:58,230 --> 01:11:59,760
会讲话
Wit. Good.

792
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,630
阁下是?
And you are?

793
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:03,510
梅慈丝
Chase.

794
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,760
你一定很难追求
And what a grand pursuit you must be.

795
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,480
我是布鲁斯韦恩  小姐是?
I'm Bruce Wayne, Miss...?

796
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:16,150
叫我什么都可以
You can call me anything you want.

797
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:21,520
各位  这是我们的大未来
Ladies and gentlemen... the future!

798
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:22,890
第二代魔幻宝盒
My New lmproved Box offers

799
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:26,740
让各位量身打造你们的幻想
fully-interactive holographic fantasies.

800
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:50,220
艾德华  你真是个天才
Edward, you're dashing and a genius.

801
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:53,060
你怎么做到的?
How do you create these images, hon?

802
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:56,760
这是我的小秘密  不告诉你
That, my dear, is my little secret.

803
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:05,630
量身打造幻想
Fully-interactive holographs.

804
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:09,070
用高频率载波发射入大脑
Only a high-frequency carrier wave, beamed into the brain...

805
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:11,140
如此而已
...could create such images.

806
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:15,440
你后悔了吧  输了就要服气
And you wish you thought of it. Don't be a sore loser.

807
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:18,220
进去呀  试试嘛
Step inside. Give it a try.

808
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:23,380
若你能制造出脑中幻象
If you can introduce images into the mind, what stops you from...

809
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:28,120
那探知他人思想也是轻而易举
...extracting images out of the mind?

810
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:31,870
不敢去试  就直说吧!
Too timid to try my machine? Just say so.

811
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,100
可以请你跳支舞吗?
Shall we dance?

812
01:13:57,150 --> 01:14:00,980
小坏蛋  你在找什么
Naughty, naughty. Looking for something?

813
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:05,290
我很好奇怎么把机器关掉
I was just wondering how you turn it off.

814
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:08,770
好
Clever.

815
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:10,830
谢谢
Thanks.

816
01:14:10,830 --> 01:14:12,220
不客气
My pleasure.

817
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:44,240
晚安  韦恩先生
Good evening, Mr. Wayne.

818
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:52,100
放轻松  告诉我你的梦境
Relax. Tell me your... dreams.

819
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:58,010
告诉我你的幻想
Tell me... your fantasies.

820
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:03,310
告诉我你心底的秘密
Tell me your secrets.

821
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:09,160
告诉我你内心深藏的
Tell me... your deepest... darkest...

822
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:10,990
恐惧
...fears.

823
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:43,560
大家不要紧张
Relax, folks!

824
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:46,470
这是很简单落后的抢劫
It's only an old-fashioned low-tech stick-up!

825
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:49,140
我们对太复杂的东西没兴趣
We're interested in the basics!

826
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:52,240
现金  珠宝  大哥大都交出来
Cash, jewelry, cellular telephones.

827
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:55,500
乖乖交出来  大家都会没事
Hand them over nice and quietly, and no one will be hurt!

828
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:02,720
出事了  阿福
Emergency, Alfred.

829
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:04,610
知道了  主人
Yes, sir.

830
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:09,780
大家冷静  别慌
Be calm, everybody! Just stay calm!

831
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:11,440
很抱歉!
Excuse me!

832
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:18,600
你把我派对弄砸了  你有病吗
You're ruining my big party! Are you insane?!

833
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:21,340
我们等你抓蝙蝠侠快不耐烦了
We're sick of waiting for you to deliver Batman.

834
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:23,340
要有耐心  大哥
Patience, O Bifurcated One.

835
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:25,440
去他的耐心  我们要他死
Patience, hell, we want him dead!

836
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,040
要蝙蝠侠出现最简单的方法
And nothing brings out the Batman

837
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,750
就是杀几个人
like a little murder and mayhem!

838
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:31,620
你该问问我的意见
You could have let me in on the caper.

839
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:34,320
我们可以好好计划一下
We could have organized it,

840
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:37,200
搞不好还可以卖个电影版权
planned it pre-sold the movie rights!

841
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:51,470
你的出场方式还不赖
Your entrance was good,

842
01:16:51,470 --> 01:16:52,750
不过他的更好
his was better.

843
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:02,210
差别何在?
The difference?

844
01:17:02,210 --> 01:17:04,270
他秀酷  你秀斗
Showmanship!

845
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:12,480
有麻烦了  阿福
Emergency, Alfred.

846
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:14,350
是的  先生
Oh, sir....

847
01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:17,580
我看我大概会被炒鱿鱼
I could be fired for this.

848
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,750
准备回家吃老米饭了
I'll go back to Buckingham Palace.

849
01:17:32,410 --> 01:17:34,700
好了  进行第二阶段
All right, boys! Phase Two!

850
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,990
午夜  我家见
My place, midnight.

851
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:45,900
瓦斯危险

852
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:54,920
完美的杀人工具
Nothing like a bad case of gas!

853
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:30,360
你为什么老是死不了
Why can't you just die?!

854
01:20:24,490 --> 01:20:25,770
老兄

855
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,530
你在干嘛?
What were you doing?!

856
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:35,440
你怎么这么不知好歹?
You got a real gratitude problem, you know that?

857
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,770
给我个名字
I need a name.

858
01:20:36,770 --> 01:20:38,870
蝙蝠男孩? 夜间游侠?
Batboy? Knight Wing?

859
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:40,980
有没有酷一点的名号?
What's a good sidekick name?

860
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:43,480
大学生  狄克葛瑞森
"Dick Grayson, college student."

861
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:46,380
去你的  我救你一命  你欠我
Screw you! I saved your life. You owe me.

862
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:49,120
你这样下去总有一天会送命
You're going to get yourself killed.

863
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,790
我是你的新拍档
I'm your new partner.

864
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:51,750
不行
No!

865
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:53,720
你去哪儿我都盯着你
Whenever you go out at night, I'll be watching.

866
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:56,630
蝙蝠侠去哪儿  我也跟着去
Where Batman goes, I'll go.

867
01:20:56,630 --> 01:20:59,300
你如何阻止我
How will you stop me?

868
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,060
我会阻止你的
I can stop you.

869
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:09,140
把这个挂在蝙蝠装旁边
Hang this next to the Batsuit... where it belongs.

870
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:16,280
你在暗中鼓励他
You're encouraging him.

871
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:19,050
充满复仇怒火的年轻人
Young men with a mind for revenge

872
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:20,780
需要一点鼓励
need little encouragement.

873
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:22,690
他们需要的是引导
They need guidance.

874
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:28,920
你该清楚这一路你怎么走过来
You, above all, should know the consequences of the life you choose.

875
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:39,740
连慈丝都说蝙蝠侠是受了诅咒
Even Chase calIs being Batman a curse.

876
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:42,310
也许她和你会来电
Perhaps the lady's just what the doctor ordered.

877
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:44,390
她才貌兼备
She seems lovely and wise.

878
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:47,830
我从未恋爱过
I've never been in love before.

879
01:21:48,410 --> 01:21:53,060
去找她  向她表白
Go to her. Tell her how you feel.

880
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:56,260
她喜欢蝙蝠侠  不是我布鲁斯
She wants Batman, not Bruce Wayne.

881
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:58,850
何不让她来决定
Let her decide.

882
01:22:52,010 --> 01:22:57,270
抱歉  真令人难以相信
I'm sorry. I can't believe this.

883
01:22:58,150 --> 01:23:01,790
从我第一次见你就期待此刻
I've imagined this moment since I first saw you.

884
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:09,050
你的眼  你的唇  你的身体
Your eyes... your lips. Your body.

885
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:14,170
现在你近在眼前
And now I have you and...

886
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:18,550
而我却想着另一个人
...I'm wishing you were somebody else.

887
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:25,020
我想我该长大了
I guess a girl has to grow up sometime.

888
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:35,920
我爱上了一个人  不是你
I've met someone. He's not you.

889
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:41,660
希望你能谅解
I hope you can understand.

890
01:23:45,740 --> 01:23:47,950
我完全了解
I understand.

891
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:53,530
好吧
Well....

892
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:09,290
蝙蝠侠地道死里逃生

893
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,910
我跟你一样难过
That's just what I said.

894
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:20,960
有个点子让我们乐一乐
Then I taught my doggie a new trick:

895
01:24:21,810 --> 01:24:23,270
如何透视人心
how to map the human mind.

896
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:26,080
想瞧瞧布鲁斯韦恩在想什么吗
Would you like to see what Bruce Wayne has in his head?

897
01:24:41,530 --> 01:24:42,770
猜猜看
Riddle me this:

898
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:48,370
什么样的人脑中想着蝙蝠?
What kind of man... has bats on the brain?

899
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:53,870
说吧  你来说
Go ahead. You can say it.

900
01:24:53,870 --> 01:24:55,430
你是个天才
You're a genius.

901
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:56,930
奥  我受不了
Oh, stop.

902
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:04,180
从今天起  蝙蝠侠永远消失了
So, from this day on... Batman is no more.

903
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:07,820
你不能撒手不管
You can't just quit.

904
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:09,070
邪恶份子仍在猖狂
There's monsters out there.

905
01:25:09,090 --> 01:25:11,110
蝙蝠侠有责任济弱扶倾
Batman has to protect the innocent.

906
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:13,530
我已花了一辈子的时间
I've dedicated my life to helping strangers I've never met.

907
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:17,610
去帮助素昧平生的人
Faces I've never seen.

908
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:19,040
好
Well...

909
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:21,370
我做得太多了
...the innocent aren't faceless anymore.

910
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:25,680
你无权要我照你意思过生活
You can't tell me what to do with the rest of my life.

911
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:29,240
我老爸说人有权决定生活目标
My dad told me that every man goes his own way.

912
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:31,710
我的生活目标就是双面人
My way goes to Two-Face.

913
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,930
你一定要帮我
You must help me.

914
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:37,490
你就算找到双面人杀了他
And if you do find Harvey... and then kill him...

915
01:25:37,490 --> 01:25:39,220
然后呢?
...what next?

916
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:44,390
完全正确
Exactly.

917
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:48,400
然后就像我一样孤独
Then you'd be alone, like me.

918
01:25:50,030 --> 01:25:52,740
忘了这些无谓的仇恨吧
No, you must let this go.

919
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:54,570
听我的话  我是你朋友
Listen to me, I'm your friend.

920
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:57,240
我不需要朋友  我要一个拍档
I don't need a friend, I need a partner.

921
01:25:57,240 --> 01:26:00,280
双面人要付出代价
Two-Face has got to pay.

922
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:01,940
求求你
Please.

923
01:26:03,550 --> 01:26:05,920
慈丝来吃晚饭
Chase is coming for dinner. I'm going to tell her...

924
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:09,190
我会把一切都告诉她
...everything.

925
01:26:11,490 --> 01:26:13,360
上去吧  我们再谈
Come upstairs. We'll talk.

926
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:30,080
晚安
Good evening.

927
01:26:30,210 --> 01:26:31,380
晚安
Good evening.

928
01:26:31,610 --> 01:26:33,160
万圣节快乐
Happy Halloween.

929
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:34,570
万圣节快乐
Happy Halloween to you.

930
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:11,420
我今晚请你来
I asked you here tonight because

931
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:14,720
是有些事想告诉你
there's something I wanted to tell you.

932
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:17,490
我也有些话想跟你讲
I wanted to tell you something too.

933
01:27:17,490 --> 01:27:19,440
是这样的...
What I wanted--

934
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:22,270
没关系  你先讲
Go ahead, you first.

935
01:27:26,230 --> 01:27:28,940
给我糖  否则就捣蛋
Trick or treat!

936
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:35,510
我以前一直迷某种类型的男人
All my life I have been... attracted to a certain kind of man.

937
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:37,070
那种痞子型的
The wrong kind.

938
01:27:37,070 --> 01:27:42,270
甚至还靠研究这种人为生
And look what I do for a living.

939
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:48,260
自从...自从我认识你以后...我
And since... since I met you, I...

940
01:27:49,290 --> 01:27:52,870
天啊  我怎么语无伦次
Oh, God. Why am I so nervous?

941
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:03,710
别吃太多糖  小心吃坏肚子
Don't eat too much tonight or you'll be sick in your beds.

942
01:28:03,710 --> 01:28:05,720
万圣节快乐
Happy Halloween!

943
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:52,640
怎么了?
What's wrong?

944
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:56,710
又来了  那些影像
It's happening again. Flashes.

945
01:28:57,630 --> 01:28:59,400
我父母的死
My parents' death.

946
01:29:00,070 --> 01:29:02,180
你的记忆又再度浮现
Your memories are trying to surface.

947
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:04,610
我要告诉你一件事
I want to tell you something.

948
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,940
我没有和任何人说过
Something I've never told anyone.

949
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:09,860
没关系  我在你身边
It's all right. It's all right. I'm here.

950
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:18,450
我就在这儿
I'm here.

951
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:24,770
就在替我父母守灵之夜
The night of my parents' wake...

952
01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:28,050
牧师安慰我的话完全没有作用
...the priest's words gave no comfort.

953
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:34,130
就在父亲书桌上
Of course. There, on my father's desk...

954
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,030
有本红色的书
...the red book.

955
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:37,890
那是他的日记
His journal.

956
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:39,660
他每天都写
He wrote in it every day.

957
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:44,650
但从那天起却永远无法继续了
But now he'd never write in it again.

958
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:47,050
在那一刻  我知道
At that moment I knew...

959
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:50,560
我的生命有重大转变
...my life would never be the same.

960
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:57,830
我冲出去  外面狂风暴雨
I raced out into the storm...

961
01:29:57,830 --> 01:30:02,370
我想将一切愤怒痛苦抛诸脑后
...trying to outrun the rage. The pain.

962
01:30:02,370 --> 01:30:05,030
然后我跌了进去
Then I fell.

963
01:30:06,030 --> 01:30:08,090
那是一个很大的洞穴
I fell forever.

964
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:15,020
那个洞仿佛存在了好几百年
The cave was monstrous. It must have been there for centuries.

965
01:30:17,450 --> 01:30:23,720
在深远的暗处我看到了...
And there... deep in the shadows... I saw....

966
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:29,030
它朝我飞过来
It was coming toward me.

967
01:30:29,230 --> 01:30:33,670
起初我很害怕  但只有一下子
I was scared at first, but only at first.

968
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:37,630
那黑暗中的影像让我立定目标
The figure in the dark was my destiny.

969
01:30:37,630 --> 01:30:41,220
它改变了我的一生
It would change my life forever.

970
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:43,440
我要用这个影像
I would use its image to strike terror

971
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:46,380
作为打击邪恶的正义化身
into the hearts of those who did evil.

972
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:48,080
我发誓绝不让我的悲剧
I would ensure what happened to me

973
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:50,260
在他人身上重演
would never happen to anyone else.

974
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,850
我要报仇
I would have my revenge.

975
01:30:57,790 --> 01:31:00,360
你想告诉我什么?
What are you trying to tell me?

976
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:03,480
我就是...
I'm....

977
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:41,500
给我糖  否则就捣蛋
Twick or tweet!

978
01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:48,900
你上当了!
Trick.

979
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:57,350
记得计划吧?
Remember the plan?

980
01:31:57,350 --> 01:31:59,500
抓了人就跑
Seize and capture.

981
01:31:59,550 --> 01:32:01,140
留下活口
No killing.

982
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:02,710
千万别忘了
That goes double for you.

983
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:08,460
若我是超级大英雄
If I was a superhero...

984
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:11,270
该躲在哪儿呢?
...where would I hide?

985
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:18,250
上帝惩罚我吧!
Spank me.

986
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:32,530
非法闯入  注意  非法闯入
Intruder alert! Intruder alert! Intruder alert!

987
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:37,530
非法闯入! 注意
Intruder alert! Intruder alert!

988
01:32:37,530 --> 01:32:38,950
安静!
Shut up!

989
01:32:49,570 --> 01:32:52,000
好戏上场了
Now, that's impressive!

990
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:12,070
把驯养的动物放回丛林很危险
It's always risky introducing a tamed animal into the wild.

991
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:28,630
它们会很难适应新环境
They may have trouble adapting to their new environment.

992

前空中飞人  现为孤儿
This acrobat turned orphan...

1136
01:49:20,510 --> 01:49:22,750
他喜欢看卡通  做白日梦

1137

常幻想和裸体女郎共处

海上坟场
...a watery grave.

1140

只要轻轻碰一下
Just one little touch...

1141
01:49:40,900 --> 01:49:46,070
五秒后他们就成了海鸥佳肴

1142
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:51,890
你无法同时救两个

还是你的菜鸟拍档?
Or the Dark Knight's junior partner?

1146
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:08,660
我可能连我自己都救不了
There is no way for me to save them or myself.

1147
01:50:08,660 --> 01:50:11,090
这是个死亡陷阱

1148

等等  我有个谜语
Wait! I have a riddle.

1152
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:27,130
让我猜吗? 真的?
For me? Really?

1153
01:50:29,850 --> 01:50:31,270
快告诉我
Tell me.

1154
01:50:34,860 --> 01:50:37,290
有眼睛却看不到

1155

黑夜如同白昼般清晰
To me, darkness is as clear as daylight.

1156
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:43,730
我是谁?
What am l?

1157
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:46,340
拜托!
Please!

1158
01:50:46,470 --> 01:50:49,600
你跟蝙蝠一样瞎了眼
You're as blind as a bat!

1159

完全正确
Exactly.

1160
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:29,140
完了
Bummer!

1161

谢了
Thanks.

1162
01:52:48,930 --> 01:52:51,630
逞英雄到头来还是一事无成
All those heroics for nothing.

1163
01:52:51,630 --> 01:52:53,530
不猜谜语  不跟你玩了
No more riddles, no more curtains one and two.

1164
01:52:53,530 --> 01:52:56,590
你准备死吧
Just plain curtains!

1165
01:52:57,370 --> 01:52:59,610
你忘了一件事
Aren't you forgetting something?

1166
01:52:59,610 --> 01:53:01,480
你的铜板
Your coin.

1167
01:53:02,610 --> 01:53:05,350
你老是下不了决定
You're always of two minds.

1168
01:53:06,050 --> 01:53:08,370
没错  你说得对
Yes, of course. You're right.

1169
01:53:08,550 --> 01:53:11,550
人常为情绪左右而无法自制
Emotion's always the enemy of justice.

1170
01:53:11,550 --> 01:53:13,660
你真是我的哥儿们
You've always been a good friend.

1171
01:54:00,270 --> 01:54:02,040
为什么?
Why?

1172
01:54:02,440 --> 01:54:06,670
为什么永远杀不了你
Why can't I... kill you?

1173
01:54:09,050 --> 01:54:11,190
轩然大波
Too many questions.

1174
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:13,490
轩然大波
Too many questions.

1175
01:54:13,780 --> 01:54:15,520
可怜的家伙
Poor Edward.

1176
01:54:15,650 --> 01:54:17,980
我一定得救两个
I had to save them both.

1177

布鲁斯韦恩就是蝙蝠侠
You see, I'm both Bruce Wayne and Batman.

1178
01:54:21,590 --> 01:54:23,590
这不只是我的义务
Not because I have to be.

1179
01:54:23,590 --> 01:54:28,010
也是我选择的生活方式
Now... because I choose to be.

1180

Thank you for responding to my request for a consultation, Dr. Meridian.

1182
01:54:55,590 --> 01:54:56,840
艾德华尼格玛一直鬼叫鬼喊
Edward Nygma...

1183
01:54:56,840 --> 01:55:02,430
宣称他知道蝙蝠侠的真实身份
...has been screaming for hours that he knows the true identity... of Batman.

1184
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:17,780

记得我吗?
Do you remember me?

1188
01:55:31,770 --> 01:55:34,160
怎么忘得了呢?
How could I forget?

1189
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:37,470
波顿医生告诉我...
Dr. Burton tells me...

1190
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:40,790
你知道谁是蝙蝠侠
...you know who Batman is.

1191
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:45,140
你不说"请"我就不告诉你
I can't tell you if you don't say, "please."

1192
01:55:45,210 --> 01:55:47,540
艾德华  请问你
Edward, please.

1193

谁是蝙蝠侠
Who is Batman?

1194
01:55:51,590 --> 01:55:54,480
就...是...我
I'm... Batman.

1195

他百分之百是个狂人

1197
01:56:25,890 --> 01:56:27,420
狂人
Wacko.

1198
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:31,140
这是心理学专有名词吗?
Is that a technical term? Listen...

1199
01:56:34,430 --> 01:56:37,690
我想我不需要这个了
...I won't need this anymore.

1200

感谢你让我有了新的美梦
