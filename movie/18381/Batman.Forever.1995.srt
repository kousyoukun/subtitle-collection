1
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:54,188
要带个三明治吗？

2
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:54,188
Can l persuade you to take a sandwich?

3
00:01:54,263 --> 00:01:56,516
我会买“外带”在车上吃

4
00:01:54,263 --> 00:01:56,516
l'll get drive-through.

5
00:02:37,142 --> 00:02:40,446
你想靠那正义使者来救你？

6
00:02:37,142 --> 00:02:40,446
You're counting on the winged avenger to deliver you from evil...

7
00:02:40,446 --> 00:02:42,628
是吧？老兄！

8
00:02:40,446 --> 00:02:42,628
...aren't you, my friend?

9
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:45,517
你要杀我吗？

10
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:45,517
Are you going to kill me?

11
00:02:45,517 --> 00:02:49,444
那倒不一定，我们还没决定好

12
00:02:45,517 --> 00:02:49,444
Maybe, maybe not. We're of two minds on the subject.

13
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,237
赌一把怎么样？

14
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,237
You a gambling man?

15
00:02:54,927 --> 00:02:57,631
来丢铜板决定如何？

16
00:02:54,927 --> 00:02:57,631
What say we flip for it?

17
00:02:57,831 --> 00:03:01,066
有人生来是英雄，有人是狗熊

18
00:02:57,831 --> 00:03:01,066
One man is born a hero, his brother a coward.

19
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:04,771
朱门酒肉臭，路有冻死骨

20
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:04,771
Babies starve, politicians grow fat...

21
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:08,908
黄钟毁弃，瓦斧雷鸣

22
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:08,908
...holy men are martyred, and junkies grow legion.

23
00:03:08,908 --> 00:03:10,376
为什么？

24
00:03:08,908 --> 00:03:10,376
Why?

25
00:03:10,376 --> 00:03:13,009
为什么？为什么？为什么？

26
00:03:10,376 --> 00:03:13,009
Why, why, why, why, why?

27
00:03:14,314 --> 00:03:15,482
狗屎运！

28
00:03:14,314 --> 00:03:15,482
Luck!

29
00:03:15,482 --> 00:03:21,931
盲目愚蠢！毫无理由的狗屎运

30
00:03:15,482 --> 00:03:21,931
Blind, stupid, simple, doo-dah... ...clueless luck!

31
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:29,263
只有丢铜板才有公平可言

32
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:29,263
The random toss... ...is the only true justice.

33
00:03:29,263 --> 00:03:35,009
看看你老兄这回运气如何？

34
00:03:29,263 --> 00:03:35,009
Let's see what justice has in store... ...for you.

35
00:03:40,142 --> 00:03:42,210
一切交给上帝吧！

36
00:03:40,142 --> 00:03:42,210
lt's like the touch of God.

37
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,799
等一下！

38
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,799
Wait, wait, wait.

39
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:48,550
你狗运不赖嘛！

40
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:48,550
Fortune smiles. Another day of wine and roses.

41
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,987
该喝啤酒吃披萨庆祝

42
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,987
ln your case, beer and pizza.

43
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:53,789
喂！我们该出发了

44
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:53,789
Out of here, guys!

45
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:56,525
你说你会让我活命 没错

46
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:56,525
-But you said you'd let me live! -Too true!

47
00:03:56,525 --> 00:04:00,269
留你当活饵，引诱那只大蝙蝠 太酷了！

48
00:03:56,525 --> 00:04:00,269
And so you shall! Nothing's better than live bait to trap a bat.

49
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:17,699
真精彩的出场

50
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:17,699
Hot entrance.

51
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:19,382
双面人吗？

52
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:19,382
Two-Face?

53
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:20,718
两名警卫丧生

54
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:20,718
2 guards are dead.

55
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,152
警方没料到他会挟持人质

56
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,152
He's holding a third hostage. Didn't see this one coming.

57
00:04:23,152 --> 00:04:24,654
我们早该想到

58
00:04:23,152 --> 00:04:24,654
We should have.

59
00:04:24,654 --> 00:04:26,386
高谭市第二银行

60
00:04:24,654 --> 00:04:26,386
The 2nd Bank of Gotham.

61
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:28,626
我逮捕他的两周年纪念

62
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:28,626
2nd anniversary of the day l captured him.

63
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:30,393
难怪他要再犯案

64
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:30,393
How could he resist?

65
00:04:30,394 --> 00:04:31,829
我是梅慈丝

66
00:04:30,394 --> 00:04:31,829
l'm Chase Meridian.

67
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:35,065
我请她担任本案顾问，她是...

68
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:35,065
l asked her to come to here to consult on the case. She specializes in--

69
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:39,803
心理学，多重人格理论专家 我早已拜读大作

70
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:39,803
Psychology, multiple personalities. l read your work.

71
00:04:39,803 --> 00:04:41,105
见解独到！

72
00:04:39,803 --> 00:04:41,105
lnsightful.

73
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:42,907
很天真，不过见解独特！

74
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:42,907
Naive, but insightful.

75
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,508
真令我受宠若惊

76
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,508
l'm flattered.

77
00:04:44,508 --> 00:04:47,012
不是每个女人都能有此殊荣的

78
00:04:44,508 --> 00:04:47,012
Not every girl makes a superhero's night table.

79
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:48,178
能跟他讲道理吗？

80
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:48,178
Can we reason with him?

81
00:04:48,178 --> 00:04:51,149
他手里有人质 和他谈判有用

82
00:04:48,178 --> 00:04:51,149
-He's got innocent people up there. -lt won't do any good.

83
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:54,221
这家伙杀人不眨眼 我同意

84
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:54,221
-He'll slaughter them without a thought. -Agreed.

85
00:04:54,286 --> 00:04:57,555
心灵的重创令他人格产生分裂

86
00:04:54,286 --> 00:04:57,555
A trauma powerful enough to create an alternate personality leaves one--

87
00:04:57,555 --> 00:05:00,792
社会的规则秩序完全置之不理

88
00:04:57,555 --> 00:05:00,792
ln a world where normal rules of right and wrong no longer apply.

89
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:01,823
完全正确

90
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:01,823
Exactly.

91
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,962
就像你一样

92
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,962
Like you.

93
00:05:03,962 --> 00:05:06,499
我可以好好写一本书来探讨

94
00:05:03,962 --> 00:05:06,499
l could write a hell of a paper

95
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:09,935
一个男人为何穿得像啮齿动物

96
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:09,935
on a grown man dressing like a flying rodent.

97
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:13,239
蝙蝠不是啮齿动物，梅医生

98
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:13,239
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.

99
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:15,508
真的？这我倒不知道

100
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:15,508
Really? l didn't know that.

101
00:05:15,508 --> 00:05:17,975
你真有意思

102
00:05:15,508 --> 00:05:17,975
You are interesting.

103
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:21,695
叫我慈丝

104
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:21,695
And call me Chase.

105
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:24,851
对了，你贵姓？

106
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:24,851
By the way, do you have a first name,

107
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:27,448
或者我可以称你蝙蝠吗？

108
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:27,448
or do l call you Bats?

109
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:35,169
让我们玩个痛快吧？

110
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:35,169
Start the party with a bang!

111
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:47,141
连送死都这么准时

112
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:47,141
Very punctual, even for his own funeral. Boys!

113
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:49,845
兄弟们，宰了他！

114
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:49,845
Kill the Bat!

115
00:06:01,222 --> 00:06:02,847
开枪！

116
00:06:01,222 --> 00:06:02,847
Blast him!

117
00:06:15,037 --> 00:06:17,089
芝麻开门！

118
00:06:15,037 --> 00:06:17,089
Open sesame.

119
00:07:21,572 --> 00:07:22,960
这是陷阱！

120
00:07:21,572 --> 00:07:22,960
lt's a trap!

121
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:00,746
各位亲爱的高谭市民请注意

122
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:00,746
Attention citizens of fair Gotham!

123
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,052
等我们开了保险箱

124
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,052
When we open that safe,

125
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,820
什么就都有了

126
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,820
we'll have everything we ever wanted...

127
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,303
足够让高谭市天下大乱

128
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,303
...enough cash to rain down upon fair Gotham a glorious flood of chaos.

129
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:17,113
当然，你这龟儿子是死定了

130
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:17,113
And, of course... ...you, my boy, dead!

131
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:21,805
那是强酸液体

132
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:21,805
lt's boiling acid!

133
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,729
为了让你死得愉快

134
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,729
For your dying pleasure,

135
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:26,311
请享用美味大补汤

136
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:26,311
we are serving the acid that made us the men we are!

137
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:31,749
抓牢了

138
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:31,749
Hold on.

139
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,531
吊走

140
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,531
Haul away!

141
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:38,759
快吊走

142
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:38,759
Yes! Haul away!

143
00:08:44,326 --> 00:08:45,013
手给我

144
00:08:44,326 --> 00:08:45,013
-Give me your hand.

145
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:46,486
别放手哇！

146
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:46,486
-Don't let go!

147
00:08:52,402 --> 00:08:53,932
这东西给我

148
00:08:52,402 --> 00:08:53,932
l must borrow this.

149
00:08:57,006 --> 00:08:59,332
那是我的助听器

150
00:08:57,006 --> 00:08:59,332
That's my hearing aid!

151
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:00,555
谢谢

152
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:00,555
Thanks.

153
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:08,348
天啊，我的鞋子要溶化了

154
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:08,348
Wow! My shoes are melting!

155
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:18,426
救命！

156
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:18,426
No more!

157
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:35,514
抓紧了

158
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:35,514
Hang on.

159
00:09:35,514 --> 00:09:36,866
抓紧？

160
00:09:35,514 --> 00:09:36,866
Hang on?

161
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:01,274
快让他下来

162
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:01,274
Get him down. Get him down.

163
00:10:01,274 --> 00:10:03,971
快 小心点

164
00:10:01,274 --> 00:10:03,971
Take it easy with him.

165
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,555
你没事的

166
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,555
You'll be all right.

167
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:06,646
放轻松

168
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:06,646
Just stay calm.

169
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:09,633
小心！让他慢慢下来

170
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:20,765
这下他没救了！

171
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:20,765
This'll fix him!

172
00:10:27,368 --> 00:10:28,755
抓牢啊！

173
00:10:27,368 --> 00:10:28,755
Hang on!

174
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,560
我来仔细瞧瞧

175
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,560
Let's see.

176
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,028
太棒了！

177
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,028
Yes!

178
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:56,741
是...多么快乐的一天

179
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:56,741
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Oh, happy day!

180
00:10:58,134 --> 00:11:02,855
向那只尖耳的夜行鼠辈永别了

181
00:10:58,134 --> 00:11:02,855
Farewell forever to that... ...pointy-eared night rat!

182
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:06,020
双面人

183
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:06,020
Face!

184
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,534
你需要心理治疗，投降吧！

185
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,534
You need help. Give it up.

186
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,064
这次让你死得有点品味

187
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,064
Have the good taste to die!

188
00:11:59,064 --> 00:12:00,344
再见了

189
00:11:59,064 --> 00:12:00,344
See you!

190
00:12:40,974 --> 00:12:43,844
尽管昨晚蝙蝠侠奋不顾身追捕

191
00:12:40,974 --> 00:12:43,844
Despite a valiant effort last night by Batman...

192
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:47,848
危险人物双面人仍侥幸逃脱

193
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:47,848
...Harvey Two-Face is still at large and extremely dangerous.

194
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:49,316
其他新闻方面

195
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:49,316
And another news today...

196
00:12:49,316 --> 00:12:53,320
富豪布鲁斯韦恩将利润分红

197
00:12:49,316 --> 00:12:53,320
...billionaire Bruce Wayne extended his profit-sharing program...

198
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,591
奖励企业内电子部门员工

199
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,591
...to the employees of the successful electronics branch of Wayne Enterprises.

200
00:13:08,503 --> 00:13:10,092
韦恩先生

201
00:13:08,503 --> 00:13:10,092
Mr. Wayne.

202
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:14,176
大驾光临，本部门无上光荣

203
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:14,176
Your inspections are a departmental highlight.

204
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:16,679
天啊，是他

205
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:16,679
Oh, my God, it's him.

206
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,348
勇敢一点，勇敢一点

207
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,348
l am a winner. l am a winner.

208
00:13:20,348 --> 00:13:22,251
不要紧张

209
00:13:20,348 --> 00:13:22,251
l am a winner.

210
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:23,840
勇敢一点

211
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:23,840
l am a winner.

212
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:29,391
这是最新科技生化治疗器

213
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:29,391
Bioremediation. Alternative fuel.

214
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,327
韦恩先生，时候不早了

215
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,327
Mr. Wayne, look at that time.

216
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:34,553
请到研发部参观吧

217
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:34,553
Perhaps we should get to R & D as soon as possible.

218
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:36,984
你是...

219
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:36,984
Mister...?

220
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:40,503
奥！布鲁斯韦恩

221
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:40,503
Oh, Bruce Wayne.

222
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:43,440
那是我，阁下是？

223
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:43,440
No, that's my name. And you are?

224
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,740
尼格玛

225
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,740
Nygma.

226
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,042
艾德华

227
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,042
Edward.

228
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:48,979
是您亲自雇用我的

229
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:48,979
Edward Nygma. You hired me personally.

230
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:51,215
我都这么告诉别人

231
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:51,215
Just like l tell everyone.

232
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:53,116
事实上我们倒没见过面

233
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:53,116
We've never actually met,

234
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:57,244
不过你的名字在我雇用合约上

235
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:57,244
but your name was on the hiring slip. l have it.

236
00:13:57,321 --> 00:13:59,489
请把手还我

237
00:13:57,321 --> 00:13:59,489
l need that hand.

238
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:01,491
奥，是的

239
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:01,491
Oh, yes, of course.

240
00:14:01,491 --> 00:14:03,021
抱歉

241
00:14:01,491 --> 00:14:03,021
l'm sorry.

242
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:04,909
因为您是

243
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:04,909
lt's just that...

244
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,965
您是我的偶像...

245
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,965
...you're my idol.

246
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:09,233
去工作

247
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:09,233
Get to work.

248
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:12,770
有人一直不肯让我们见面

249
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:12,770
And some people have been trying to keep us apart.

250
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,438
回去工作

251
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,438
Back to work.

252
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:15,874
没关系

253
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:15,874
lt's okay.

254
00:14:15,874 --> 00:14:17,942
你在想什么？

255
00:14:15,874 --> 00:14:17,942
What's on your mind?

256
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:19,410
完全正确

257
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:19,410
Precisely.

258
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,747
我们都在想些什么？

259
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,747
What's on all our minds?

260
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:23,763
脑波...

261
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:23,763
Brain waves.

262
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:34,326
韦恩企业集团未来希望之所系

263
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:34,326
The future... ...of Wayne Enterprises... ...is brain waves.

264
00:14:35,661 --> 00:14:36,962
真抱歉，韦恩先生

265
00:14:35,661 --> 00:14:36,962
l must apologize, Mr. Wayne.

266
00:14:36,962 --> 00:14:39,632
我今天终止了他的研究计划

267
00:14:36,962 --> 00:14:39,632
-l terminated his project today.

268
00:14:39,632 --> 00:14:41,033
没关系

269
00:14:39,632 --> 00:14:41,033
-lt's okay.

270
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:42,800
我这边有

271
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:42,800
l have it!

272
00:14:51,945 --> 00:14:53,279
我的发明

273
00:14:51,945 --> 00:14:53,279
My invention...

274
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,751
将电视讯号发射入人脑中

275
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,751
...beams any TV signal directly into the human brain.

276
00:14:57,751 --> 00:15:01,554
借刺激中子以操控脑波

277
00:14:57,751 --> 00:15:01,554
By stimulating neurons, manipulating brain waves...

278
00:15:01,554 --> 00:15:04,225
这机器可让他电视观众

279
00:15:01,554 --> 00:15:04,225
...this device makes the audience

280
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:07,862
仿佛成为剧中人物身历其境

281
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:07,862
feel like they're inside the show.

282
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:10,531
完全忘却俗世纷扰

283
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:10,531
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world?

284
00:15:10,531 --> 00:15:14,529
你刚刚说“操控脑波”吗？

285
00:15:10,531 --> 00:15:14,529
Did you say ''manipulating brain waves?''

286
00:15:16,637 --> 00:15:18,226
是的

287
00:15:16,637 --> 00:15:18,226
Yes.

288
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,141
不过...

289
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,141
But...

290
00:15:20,141 --> 00:15:24,246
像您这种大人物不会需要的

291
00:15:20,141 --> 00:15:24,246
...someone like you would never need it.

292
00:15:24,246 --> 00:15:31,018
如此聪明、机智、迷人的名人

293
00:15:24,246 --> 00:15:31,018
Someone so... ...intelligent, witty and... ...charming.

294
00:15:31,018 --> 00:15:33,922
我需要资金来作人体实验

295
00:15:31,018 --> 00:15:33,922
l need a bit of additional funding for human trials.

296
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:36,024
来，我来示范

297
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:36,024
Let me show you, please!

298
00:15:36,024 --> 00:15:39,963
我要看详细的设计计划

299
00:15:36,024 --> 00:15:39,963
Now, listen... ...l want a full set of schematics on this, okay?

300
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:42,831
布鲁斯，我们会成为合作伙伴

301
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:42,831
We'll be full partners in this, Bruce.

302
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:46,336
你看，我们是天生最佳拍挡

303
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:46,336
Look at us! Two of a kind!

304
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:49,846
打电话给我助理，她会安排

305
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:49,846
You call my assistant, Margaret. She'll set something up.

306
00:15:49,973 --> 00:15:53,590
很明显，你在敷衍我

307
00:15:49,973 --> 00:15:53,590
That's not... ...going to be good for me.

308
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,946
给我一个肯定的答案

309
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,946
l need an answer now.

310
00:15:56,946 --> 00:15:59,315
这是我该得的

311
00:15:56,946 --> 00:15:59,315
l think l deserve it.

312
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:02,752
抱歉，你的要求恕难同意

313
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:02,752
l'm sorry, then the answer is no.

314
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:05,189
干扰人类脑波

315
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:05,189
Tampering with people's brain waves...

316
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:07,624
思想操控机器

317
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:07,624
...mind manipulation...

318
00:16:07,624 --> 00:16:10,793
恐怕会引起轩然大波

319
00:16:07,624 --> 00:16:10,793
...it just raises too many questions.

320
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:12,074
抱歉

321
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:12,074
Sorry.

322
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,429
多谢大家，谢谢你们的努力

323
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,429
Thanks, keep up the good work. Looks great.

324
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:16,734
好了，各位

325
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:16,734
All right, everyone!

326
00:16:16,734 --> 00:16:18,335
继续工作

327
00:16:16,734 --> 00:16:18,335
Back to work!

328
00:16:18,335 --> 00:16:21,005
等一下再跟你算帐

329
00:16:18,335 --> 00:16:21,005
We'll discuss this later!

330
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,651
你怎么可以让我失望

331
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,651
You were supposed to understand.

332
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:35,220
我会让你认识清楚

333
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:35,220
l'll make you understand.

334
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,047
锁上

335
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,047
Lock.

336
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,650
启动

337
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,650
Chair.

338
00:16:56,374 --> 00:16:58,978
讯号收到

339
00:16:56,374 --> 00:16:58,978
l saw the signal.

340
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:00,887
一切准备就绪

341
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:00,887
All is ready.

342
00:17:40,788 --> 00:17:42,390
局长，他人呢？

343
00:17:40,788 --> 00:17:42,390
Commissioner?

344
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,884
他回家了

345
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,884
He's home.

346
00:17:44,793 --> 00:17:47,629
是我发的讯号

347
00:17:44,793 --> 00:17:47,629
l sent the signal.

348
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:49,681
怎么回事？

349
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:49,681
What's wrong?

350
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:55,070
昨晚我注意到双面人一件事

351
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:55,070
Last night l noticed something about Two-Face:

352
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,694
他的铜板

353
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,694
his coin.

354
00:17:56,704 --> 00:17:58,440
那是他的弱点

355
00:17:56,704 --> 00:17:58,440
lt's his Achilles' heel.

356
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,142
可以好好研究一下

357
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,142
lt can be exploited.

358
00:18:00,142 --> 00:18:01,977
我知道了

359
00:18:00,142 --> 00:18:01,977
l know.

360
00:18:01,977 --> 00:18:03,912
你叫我来就为了这个？

361
00:18:01,977 --> 00:18:03,912
You called me for this?

362
00:18:03,912 --> 00:18:06,582
我的呼叫器可不是BB机

363
00:18:03,912 --> 00:18:06,582
The Batsignal is not a beeper.

364
00:18:06,582 --> 00:18:11,303
你对我的吸引力不只在公事上

365
00:18:06,582 --> 00:18:11,303
l wish l could say that my interest in you was... ...purely professional.

366
00:18:11,454 --> 00:18:13,823
你在挑逗我吗？

367
00:18:11,454 --> 00:18:13,823
You trying to get under my cape?

368
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:17,426
女人整天研究精神病很寂寞的

369
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:17,426
A girl can't live by psychoses alone.

370
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:20,864
是那部车吧？马子喜欢搔包车

371
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:20,864
lt's the car, right? Chicks love it.

372
00:18:20,864 --> 00:18:24,033
为什么坏男人总是吸引着我

373
00:18:20,864 --> 00:18:24,033
What is it about the wrong kind of man?

374
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:27,237
高中时是戴耳环的痞子

375
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:27,237
ln grade school: guys with earrings.

376
00:18:27,237 --> 00:18:30,474
大学是骑机车，穿皮夹克的

377
00:18:27,237 --> 00:18:30,474
College: motorcycles, leather jackets.

378
00:18:30,474 --> 00:18:32,727
现在嘛...

379
00:18:30,474 --> 00:18:32,727
Now...

380
00:18:34,878 --> 00:18:37,748
黑色橡皮衣的男子

381
00:18:34,878 --> 00:18:37,748
...black rubber.

382
00:18:37,748 --> 00:18:40,938
试试救火员，脱衣服比较方便

383
00:18:37,748 --> 00:18:40,938
Try a fireman. Less to take off.

384
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,671
这我不在乎

385
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,671
l don't mind the work.

386
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:45,856
只可惜看不到你的真面目

387
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:45,856
Pity l can't see behind the mask.

388
00:18:45,856 --> 00:18:47,659
每个人都戴着面具过日子

389
00:18:45,856 --> 00:18:47,659
We all wear masks.

390
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,593
我的生命是本打开的书

391
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,593
My life's an open book.

392
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:51,095
想看看吗

393
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:51,095
You read?

394
00:18:51,095 --> 00:18:53,633
我不想在人家家里野餐

395
00:18:51,095 --> 00:18:53,633
l don't blend in at a family picnic.

396
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,998
我们可以试试，我会准备酒

397
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,998
We could give it a try. l'll bring the wine...

398
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:02,365
你带着你受创的灵魂前来

399
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:02,365
...you bring your scarred psyche.

400
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,443
你很主动，是吧？

401
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,443
Direct, aren't you?

402
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:07,045
你喜欢主动的女人

403
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:07,045
You like strong women.

404
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,781
我对你研究过

405
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,781
l've done my homework.

406
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:12,717
还是要我穿紧身衣带皮鞭？

407
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:12,717
Or do l need skintight vinyl and a whip?

408
00:19:12,717 --> 00:19:15,453
我对女人向来不在行

409
00:19:12,717 --> 00:19:15,453
l haven't had much luck with women.

410
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:18,407
也许是对象不适合

411
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:18,407
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman.

412
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,464
我收到了讯号

413
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,464
l saw the signal.

414
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,465
怎么呢？

415
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,465
-What's going on?

416
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,162
没事

417
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,162
-Nothing.

418
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:30,503
真的没事

419
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:30,503
False alarm.

420
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,033
是吗？

421
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,033
Are you sure?

422
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:52,268
女人啊！

423
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:52,268
Women.

424
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,959
成功了！

425
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,959
Now l've got it!

426
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:10,154
轩然大波，引起轩然大波

427
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:10,154
Too many questions. There's too many questions.

428
00:20:10,154 --> 00:20:13,615
轩然大波...

429
00:20:10,154 --> 00:20:13,615
Too many....

430
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:15,384
我就证明给你看

431
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:15,384
l'll show you it works!

432
00:20:15,384 --> 00:20:17,785
你到底在胡搞什么

433
00:20:15,384 --> 00:20:17,785
What the hell is going on here?!

434
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:19,822
这个计划已经被终止

435
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:19,822
l told you this project is terminated!

436
00:20:19,822 --> 00:20:22,075
我要叫警卫来

437
00:20:19,822 --> 00:20:22,075
l'm calling security!

438
00:20:27,696 --> 00:20:29,878
咖啡因有碍你健康

439
00:20:27,696 --> 00:20:29,878
Caffeine will kill you!

440
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,905
天鼠先生，醒来吧

441
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,905
Rise and shine, little guinea pig.

442
00:20:36,905 --> 00:20:38,508
你在干嘛！

443
00:20:36,905 --> 00:20:38,508
What are you doing?

444
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:39,843
快放了我

445
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:39,843
Untie me!

446
00:20:39,843 --> 00:20:41,611
反正又不会痛

447
00:20:39,843 --> 00:20:41,611
This won't hurt.

448
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:44,280
至少我是这样认为

449
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:44,280
Least, l don't think it will.

450
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:46,616
你在干嘛？

451
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:46,616
What are you doing?

452
00:20:46,616 --> 00:20:49,686
你敢碰那开关...

453
00:20:46,616 --> 00:20:49,686
You touch that switch and--

454
00:20:49,686 --> 00:20:51,180
这个吗？

455
00:20:49,686 --> 00:20:51,180
This?

456
00:21:06,404 --> 00:21:08,239
画面不见了

457
00:21:06,404 --> 00:21:08,239
Losing resolution.

458
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:09,792
能量加强

459
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:09,792
More power!

460
00:21:33,231 --> 00:21:35,000
艾德华尼格玛

461
00:21:33,231 --> 00:21:35,000
Edward Nygma!

462
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,835
请准备上场

463
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,835
You're the next contestant on...

464
00:21:36,835 --> 00:21:40,476
脑力激荡超级秀

465
00:21:36,835 --> 00:21:40,476
...Brain Drain!

466
00:21:40,973 --> 00:21:45,437
我选看起来笨头笨脑的1号

467
00:21:40,973 --> 00:21:45,437
l'll take what's inside thick skull number one!

468
00:21:45,445 --> 00:21:48,114
他能得到什么大奖

469
00:21:45,445 --> 00:21:48,114
What have we got for him?

470
00:21:48,114 --> 00:21:52,318
史帝雷，这是我研究的大突破

471
00:21:48,114 --> 00:21:52,318
Oh, Stickley, l'm having a breakthrough!

472
00:21:52,318 --> 00:21:53,953
你准备抓狂吧

473
00:21:52,318 --> 00:21:53,953
And a breakdown!

474
00:21:53,953 --> 00:21:56,385
反正我是个大天才

475
00:21:53,953 --> 00:21:56,385
Nevertheless, l'm smarter. l'm a genius.

476
00:21:56,756 --> 00:21:59,492
不对，是超级天才

477
00:21:56,756 --> 00:21:59,492
No, several geniuses.

478
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:05,466
比弗洛依德还厉害的旷世奇才

479
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:05,466
A gaggle, a swarm... ...a flock of freaking Freuds!

480
00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:07,935
猜猜看

481
00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:07,935
Riddle me this, Fred.

482
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:10,337
什么东西对一个人很重要

483
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:10,337
What is everything to someone...

484
00:22:10,337 --> 00:22:12,773
对别人却微不足道？

485
00:22:10,337 --> 00:22:12,773
...and nothing to everyone else?

486
00:22:12,773 --> 00:22:14,975
是您老兄的智力

487
00:22:12,773 --> 00:22:14,975
Your mind, baby!

488
00:22:14,975 --> 00:22:17,511
现在我俩智力将彼此共享

489
00:22:14,975 --> 00:22:17,511
Now mine pumps with the power of yours!

490
00:22:17,511 --> 00:22:21,348
你的智慧归我所有

491
00:22:17,511 --> 00:22:21,348
l'm sucking up your lQ

492
00:22:21,348 --> 00:22:25,239
我会把你的大脑皮质

493
00:22:21,348 --> 00:22:25,239
Vacuuming your cortex

494
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:31,743
吸得一干二净

495
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:31,743
Feeding off your brain

496
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:53,428
太刺激了！

497
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:53,428
What a rush!

498
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,402
发生什么事？

499
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,402
What just happened?

500
00:22:58,955 --> 00:23:01,858
一点小小的副作用

501
00:22:58,955 --> 00:23:01,858
A very surprising side effect.

502
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:05,796
当您沉醉在我的立体电视之时

503
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:05,796
While you were mesmerized by my 3-D TV...

504
00:23:05,796 --> 00:23:09,099
我用你中枢能量让我更聪明了

505
00:23:05,796 --> 00:23:09,099
...l used your neural energy to grow smarter.

506
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:11,835
大老板说得没错

507
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:11,835
Bruce Wayne was right!

508
00:23:11,835 --> 00:23:15,133
你这个疯子、怪胎

509
00:23:11,835 --> 00:23:15,133
You demented, bizarre, unethical toad!

510
00:23:15,172 --> 00:23:17,508
这是非法脑波干扰

511
00:23:15,172 --> 00:23:17,508
lt is brain manipulation!

512
00:23:17,508 --> 00:23:18,909
我要检举你

513
00:23:17,508 --> 00:23:18,909
l'm reporting you to the FCC!

514
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:21,745
非法从事人体实验！

515
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:21,745
The human experimentation board! The AMl!

516
00:23:21,745 --> 00:23:23,847
我会向警方报告

517
00:23:21,745 --> 00:23:23,847
And the police!

518
00:23:23,847 --> 00:23:26,083
你准备坐牢吧！

519
00:23:23,847 --> 00:23:26,083
You are going up on charges...

520
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:31,113
我看你也得进疯人院

521
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:31,113
...to court, to jail... ...and then to a mental institution forever!

522
00:23:31,122 --> 00:23:35,359
你现在就被开除了！滚吧！

523
00:23:31,122 --> 00:23:35,359
But, first and foremost, Nygma, you are fired!

524
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,648
听到吗？快滚吧！

525
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,648
Do you hear me? Fired!

526
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:44,527
那可不一定

527
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:44,527
l don't think so.

528
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,103
救命啊！

529
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,103
Help!

530
00:24:02,922 --> 00:24:04,131
抓紧啊！

531
00:24:02,922 --> 00:24:04,131
Hang on!

532
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:09,161
老兄！

533
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:09,161
Babe!

534
00:24:09,161 --> 00:24:12,560
你被开除了！

535
00:24:09,161 --> 00:24:12,560
You are fired!

536
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:15,535
或者该说是...

537
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:15,535
Or should l say...

538
00:24:15,535 --> 00:24:17,480
被“终结”了？

539
00:24:15,535 --> 00:24:17,480
...terminated?

540
00:24:21,975 --> 00:24:24,608
再见了，蠢才

541
00:24:21,975 --> 00:24:24,608
Surf's up, Big Kahuna!

542
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:31,318
姿势不错，可惜落水不佳

543
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:31,318
Nice form, but rough on the landing.

544
00:24:31,318 --> 00:24:33,915
大概只能得铜牌

545
00:24:31,318 --> 00:24:33,915
He may have to settle for the Bronze.

546
00:24:38,425 --> 00:24:41,262
猜个谜语，韦恩先生

547
00:24:38,425 --> 00:24:41,262
Questions, Mr. Wayne?

548
00:24:41,262 --> 00:24:45,300
我的实验会造成轩然大波

549
00:24:41,262 --> 00:24:45,300
My work raises too many questions.

550
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:51,117
怎么没人给你好好上一课呢？

551
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:51,117
Why hasn't anybody... ...put you in your place?

552
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:55,677
前任高谭市首席检察官丹特

553
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:55,677
Harvey Dent, once Gotham's District Attorney...

554
00:24:55,677 --> 00:24:59,114
在法庭上遭黑社会以毒液毁容

555
00:24:55,677 --> 00:24:59,114
...was horribly scarred by underworld kingpin, Boss Moroni.

556
00:24:59,114 --> 00:25:01,216
蝙蝠侠曾企图阻止不及

557
00:24:59,114 --> 00:25:01,216
Although Batman tried to save him...

558
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:03,519
丹特左半脸严重毁损

559
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:03,519
...Dent's left-brain damage

560
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:06,454
心理失衡导致他成为知名罪犯

561
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:06,454
turned him into a violent criminal...

562
00:25:06,454 --> 00:25:08,524
并归咎蝙蝠侠誓言报复

563
00:25:06,454 --> 00:25:08,524
...who blamed Batman and who has vowed to destroy him.

564
00:25:08,524 --> 00:25:10,859
双面人现为超级要犯

565
00:25:08,524 --> 00:25:10,859
Harvey Two-Face is extremely dangerous,

566
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:13,262
请大家提高警觉

567
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:13,262
repeat, extremely dangerous.

568
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,031
局长来电

569
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,031
That was the Commissioner.

570
00:25:15,031 --> 00:25:17,852
公司里出意外了

571
00:25:15,031 --> 00:25:17,852
There's been an accident at Wayne Enterprises.

572
00:25:19,828 --> 00:25:21,524
死得真惨

573
00:25:19,828 --> 00:25:21,524
Horrible way to die.

574
00:25:21,537 --> 00:25:23,707
电眼监视器在那边

575
00:25:21,537 --> 00:25:23,707
The surveillance cameras are down here.

576
00:25:23,707 --> 00:25:25,408
我们会尽量努力搜索

577
00:25:23,707 --> 00:25:25,408
We'll dredge the river, but with that current,

578
00:25:25,408 --> 00:25:27,805
不过可能找不到尸体了

579
00:25:25,408 --> 00:25:27,805
l doubt we'll find the body.

580
00:25:31,582 --> 00:25:33,183
为什么？

581
00:25:31,582 --> 00:25:33,183
Why?

582
00:25:33,183 --> 00:25:36,409
天啊！为什么

583
00:25:33,183 --> 00:25:36,409
Oh, why?

584
00:25:37,354 --> 00:25:39,690
我不敢相信！

585
00:25:37,354 --> 00:25:39,690
l just can't believe it.

586
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,360
同事这么多年了

587
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,360
Two years working in the same office.

588
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:47,058
他和我情同父子，有如手足

589
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:47,058
He was like my father... ...my brother...

590
00:25:47,198 --> 00:25:49,967
我俩简直就是哥儿们

591
00:25:47,198 --> 00:25:49,967
...or a cousin that visits a lot.

592
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:52,328
艾德华，你要节哀

593
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:52,328
Get a grip, Edward.

594
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:55,473
我在他房间发现这个

595
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:55,473
l found this in my cubicle.

596
00:25:55,473 --> 00:25:57,508
就是他亲笔写的

597
00:25:55,473 --> 00:25:57,508
You'll find the handwriting matches his,

598
00:25:57,508 --> 00:26:00,355
连遣词用字都一样

599
00:25:57,508 --> 00:26:00,355
as does the sentence structure.

600
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:06,417
我无法再待在这里了

601
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:06,417
l couldn't possibly continue on here.

602
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:10,688
这么多痛苦的回忆

603
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:10,688
The memories....

604
00:26:11,457 --> 00:26:14,593
这是昨晚的监视器记录

605
00:26:11,457 --> 00:26:14,593
This is last night's security log.

606
00:26:14,593 --> 00:26:16,989
那是史帝雷

607
00:26:14,593 --> 00:26:16,989
There's Stickley.

608
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,774
事实很清楚了

609
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,774
Pretty cut and dry.

610
00:26:24,136 --> 00:26:26,567
别矣！这个残酷的世界！

611
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:32,255
确实是自杀无疑

612
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:32,255
Yes, definitely suicide.

613
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:36,077
谢谢您合作，我们会保持联络

614
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:36,077
Thanks very much for your help, Bruce. We'll be in touch.

615
00:26:39,486 --> 00:26:42,757
史帝雷自杀毫无道理

616
00:26:39,486 --> 00:26:42,757
Stickley's suicide doesn't make sense.

617
00:26:42,757 --> 00:26:44,859
全额保险给付给他家庭

618
00:26:42,757 --> 00:26:44,859
l want full benefits for his family.

619
00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:47,260
可是自杀死亡保险不理赔

620
00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:47,260
Suicide's not covered by our policy.

621
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,920
我知道，全额给付

622
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,920
l know. Full benefits.

623
00:26:48,928 --> 00:26:51,165
记者一直打电话来询问

624
00:26:48,928 --> 00:26:51,165
Gossip Gerty called 32 times.

625
00:26:51,165 --> 00:26:53,099
你准备带谁参加慈善马戏表演

626
00:26:51,165 --> 00:26:53,099
Who are you taking to the Charity Circus?

627
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:55,970
我决定了会告诉你，这是什么

628
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:55,970
l'll let you know. What's this?

629
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,429
不知道

630
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,429
l don't know.

631
00:26:57,605 --> 00:26:59,372
不知是谁送来的

632
00:26:57,605 --> 00:26:59,372
l didn't see anyone.

633
00:27:08,617 --> 00:27:11,153
看着我脸上的数字

634
00:27:08,617 --> 00:27:11,153
''lf you look at the numbers on my face...

635
00:27:11,153 --> 00:27:13,964
你永远找不到13

636
00:27:11,153 --> 00:27:13,964
''...you won't find 13 anyplace.''

637
00:27:14,423 --> 00:27:15,917
真恶心

638
00:27:14,423 --> 00:27:15,917
That's hideous.

639
00:27:15,924 --> 00:27:17,513
这什么意思

640
00:27:15,924 --> 00:27:17,513
What does it mean?

641
00:27:17,526 --> 00:27:19,326
这个是谜语

642
00:27:17,526 --> 00:27:19,326
lt's a riddle.

643
00:27:19,326 --> 00:27:22,164
脸上的数字...13

644
00:27:19,326 --> 00:27:22,164
''Numbers on my face...13.''

645
00:27:22,164 --> 00:27:23,565
一到十二

646
00:27:22,164 --> 00:27:23,565
1 through 12.

647
00:27:23,565 --> 00:27:25,617
答案是时钟

648
00:27:23,565 --> 00:27:25,617
The answer is a clock.

649
00:27:25,634 --> 00:27:28,337
谁会没事送个谜语给你？

650
00:27:25,634 --> 00:27:28,337
Who would send you a riddle?

651
00:27:28,337 --> 00:27:31,444
这个嘛...倒也是个谜

652
00:27:28,337 --> 00:27:31,444
That, Maggie... ...is the riddle.

653
00:28:15,587 --> 00:28:17,983
猜猜我今天干了什么好事

654
00:28:15,587 --> 00:28:17,983
Guess what l did today?

655
00:28:44,717 --> 00:28:47,078
韦恩大老板

656
00:28:44,717 --> 00:28:47,078
Wayne Manor.

657
00:28:56,128 --> 00:28:57,718
走着瞧

658
00:28:56,128 --> 00:28:57,718
See you soon.

659
00:29:28,763 --> 00:29:31,574
我约了梅博士，谢谢

660
00:29:28,763 --> 00:29:31,574
Dr. Meridian, please. Thank you.

661
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:05,460
我...大概来早了

662
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:05,460
l... ...guess l'm early.

663
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:08,317
我和你约了时间

664
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:08,317
l have an appointment.

665
00:30:08,338 --> 00:30:10,306
我是布鲁斯韦恩

666
00:30:08,338 --> 00:30:10,306
l'm Bruce Wayne.

667
00:30:10,306 --> 00:30:14,478
太好了，那你可以赔我一扇门

668
00:30:10,306 --> 00:30:14,478
Good. You can afford a door.

669
00:30:14,478 --> 00:30:15,794
抱歉

670
00:30:14,478 --> 00:30:15,794
l'm sorry.

671
00:30:17,748 --> 00:30:23,954
我在外面听到声音...

672
00:30:17,748 --> 00:30:23,954
You...sounded like you were in...

673
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:29,169
以为你有什么麻烦

674
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:29,169
...you know, trouble.

675
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,297
这是我宣泄暴力的方式

676
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,297
l prefer healthy expressions of violence

677
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:35,179
以免我把门给拆了

678
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:35,179
as opposed to breaking in.

679
00:30:35,475 --> 00:30:36,578
好吧

680
00:30:35,475 --> 00:30:36,578
So...

681
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,889
有什么可效劳的吗？

682
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,889
...how can l help you?

683
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,277
有人不断寄情书给我

684
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,277
Someone's been sending me love letters.

685
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:49,481
一封寄到办公室，一封寄到家

686
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:49,481
One at my office and one at my home.

687
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:53,716
戈登局长说可以听听您的高见

688
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:53,716
Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your opinion.

689
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:58,640
时钟

690
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:58,640
A clock.

691
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:00,251
时钟

692
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:00,251
Clock.

693
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:08,067
把我折断，摩擦我的头

694
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:08,067
''Tear one off and scratch my head...

695
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:11,328
红头随后成黑头

696
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:11,328
''...what once was red is black instead.''

697
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:14,278
火柴

698
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:14,278
A match.

699
00:31:19,412 --> 00:31:22,473
我看这家伙是个狂人

700
00:31:19,412 --> 00:31:22,473
My opinion: this letter writer is a wacko.

701
00:31:22,616 --> 00:31:23,825
狂人？

702
00:31:22,616 --> 00:31:23,825
Wacko?

703
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:26,151
心理学名词吗？

704
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:26,151
That a technical term?

705
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:32,025
典型患者具有沉迷杀人之倾向

706
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:32,025
Patient may suffer from obsession... ...with potential homicidal tendencies.

707
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:33,934
够专业吗？

708
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:33,934
ls that better for you?

709
00:31:34,095 --> 00:31:35,530
所以基本上你认为...

710
00:31:34,095 --> 00:31:35,530
So, what you're saying is...

711
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,465
这家伙是个疯子

712
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,465
...this guy's a total wacko.

713
00:31:37,465 --> 00:31:39,339
完全正确

714
00:31:37,465 --> 00:31:39,339
Exactly.

715
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:42,436
他疯狂地对你着迷

716
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:42,436
He's obsessed with you.

717
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:45,770
只有摧毁偏执对象能自我救赎

718
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:45,770
His only escape may be to purge the fixation.

719
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:48,500
就是把我宰了

720
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:48,500
To kill me.

721
00:31:48,977 --> 00:31:51,303
看不出来你还蛮有概念的

722
00:31:48,977 --> 00:31:51,303
l think you understand obsession better than you let on.

723
00:31:55,616 --> 00:31:57,384
喜欢蝙蝠吗？

724
00:31:55,616 --> 00:31:57,384
You like bats?

725
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,816
那是一种心理测验

726
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,816
That's a Rorschach, Mr. Wayne.

727
00:31:59,822 --> 00:32:01,490
又称墨迹测验

728
00:31:59,822 --> 00:32:01,490
An inkblot.

729
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,258
人们只被想看的墨点所吸引

730
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,258
People see what they want.

731
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:07,319
问题在于，你喜欢蝙蝠吗？

732
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:07,319
The question is, do you like bats?

733
00:32:09,598 --> 00:32:11,851
你还在玩这个？

734
00:32:09,598 --> 00:32:11,851
Still playing with dolls?

735
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:15,604
她是马来人的守护神

736
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:15,604
She's a Malaysian dream warden.

737
00:32:15,604 --> 00:32:19,245
他们相信她能让你不做恶梦

738
00:32:15,604 --> 00:32:19,245
Some cultures believe she protects you from bad dreams.

739
00:32:19,743 --> 00:32:22,625
你一定觉得有点可笑

740
00:32:19,743 --> 00:32:22,625
lt's silly to you, l'm sure.

741
00:32:26,316 --> 00:32:28,783
你看起来不太好

742
00:32:26,316 --> 00:32:28,783
You look so sad.

743
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,915
需要一个娃娃吗？

744
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,915
Do you need one?

745
00:32:32,023 --> 00:32:34,727
我？谢了，有此必要吗？

746
00:32:32,023 --> 00:32:34,727
Me? No. Why would l?

747
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,131
你看起来十分心神不宁

748
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,131
You're not exactly what you seem, are you?

749
00:32:40,131 --> 00:32:43,844
你到底为什么来此找我？

750
00:32:40,131 --> 00:32:43,844
What is it you really came here for?

751
00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:47,200
呃，时间到了

752
00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:47,200
Yikes, time's up.

753
00:32:48,572 --> 00:32:51,108
通常这句话该由我来说

754
00:32:48,572 --> 00:32:51,108
That's usually my line.

755
00:32:51,108 --> 00:32:52,745
我真希望能再多聊会儿

756
00:32:51,108 --> 00:32:52,745
l'd love to stay here chatting.

757
00:32:52,745 --> 00:32:55,279
真的吗？

758
00:32:52,745 --> 00:32:55,279
Would you?

759
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,113
我可不太相信

760
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,113
l'm not so sure.

761
00:32:56,113 --> 00:33:00,751
我希望你把这身衣服脱掉

762
00:32:56,113 --> 00:33:00,751
l must get you out of those clothes.

763
00:33:00,751 --> 00:33:02,054
什么？

764
00:33:00,751 --> 00:33:02,054
Excuse me?

765
00:33:02,054 --> 00:33:04,356
换上黑色晚礼服

766
00:33:02,054 --> 00:33:04,356
And into a black dress.

767
00:33:04,356 --> 00:33:06,953
医生，你喜欢马戏表演吗？

768
00:33:04,356 --> 00:33:06,953
Tell me, doctor, do you like the circus?

769
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:09,194
巨蛋体育馆

770
00:33:09,194 --> 00:33:11,863
高谭市马戏慈善表演

771
00:33:25,877 --> 00:33:28,867
各位先生，各位先生

772
00:33:25,877 --> 00:33:28,867
Ladies and gentlemen...

773
00:33:28,915 --> 00:33:30,504
各位小朋友

774
00:33:28,915 --> 00:33:30,504
...boys and girls of all ages...

775
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,120
欢迎观赏全世界最伟大的表演

776
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,120
...welcome to the greatest show on earth!

777
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,023
这位高贵的女士是谁？

778
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,023
Who is this beautiful young woman you're with?

779
00:33:37,023 --> 00:33:38,559
梅慈丝医师

780
00:33:37,023 --> 00:33:38,559
Dr. Chase Meridian.

781
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,827
医师？

782
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,827
A doctor?

783
00:33:39,827 --> 00:33:41,356
那一种医生？

784
00:33:39,827 --> 00:33:41,356
What kind of doctor?

785
00:33:41,527 --> 00:33:43,729
门票收入将捐给市立儿童医院

786
00:33:41,527 --> 00:33:43,729
...for Gotham Children's Hospital.

787
00:33:43,729 --> 00:33:48,235
让我们感谢最高金额捐款人

788
00:33:43,729 --> 00:33:48,235
Let's thank our largest single donor:

789
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,524
布鲁斯韦恩

790
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,524
Bruce Wayne!

791
00:33:51,538 --> 00:33:53,841
各位女士先生

792
00:33:51,538 --> 00:33:53,841
Ladies and gentlemen...

793
00:33:53,841 --> 00:33:56,610
将在离地七十尺高空中

794
00:33:53,841 --> 00:33:56,610
...70 feet above the ground...

795
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:00,147
表演令您叹为观止的特技

796
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:00,147
...performing feats of unimaginable aerial skill...

797
00:34:00,147 --> 00:34:02,721
空中飞人葛瑞森家族！

798
00:34:00,147 --> 00:34:02,721
...the Flying Graysons!

799
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,451
我周末要去攀岩

800
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,451
Listen.... l'm going rock climbing this weekend. Would you join me?

801
00:35:00,844 --> 00:35:03,680
呃！我很想去

802
00:35:00,844 --> 00:35:03,680
l'd like to.

803
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,156
我喜欢攀岩，真的

804
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,156
l love climbing. l really love it.

805
00:35:07,484 --> 00:35:08,765
但是？

806
00:35:07,484 --> 00:35:08,765
But?

807
00:35:09,086 --> 00:35:10,675
我有对象了

808
00:35:09,086 --> 00:35:10,675
l've met someone.

809
00:35:11,656 --> 00:35:14,292
那可真快，你才刚搬来不久

810
00:35:11,656 --> 00:35:14,292
That's fast work. You just moved here.

811
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:18,663
就像一时天雷勾动地火...

812
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:18,663
You could say he... ...dropped out of the sky and...

813
00:35:18,663 --> 00:35:20,395
一发不可收拾

814
00:35:18,663 --> 00:35:20,395
...bang!

815
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:23,768
我觉得对方也同样来电

816
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:23,768
l think he felt it too.

817
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:25,103
他的确如此

818
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:25,103
He sure did.

819
00:35:25,103 --> 00:35:26,835
什么？

820
00:35:25,103 --> 00:35:26,835
What?

821
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,298
谁抗拒得了呢？

822
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,298
Who wouldn't?

823
00:35:30,209 --> 00:35:37,015
接下来由飞人家族最年轻成员

824
00:35:30,209 --> 00:35:37,015
Now... ...Richard... ...the youngest flying Grayson...

825
00:35:37,015 --> 00:35:41,665
李查表演惊心动魄的死亡翻滚

826
00:35:37,015 --> 00:35:41,665
...will perform the awe-inspiring... ...death drop...

827
00:35:42,688 --> 00:35:45,713
安全网将全部撤走

828
00:35:42,688 --> 00:35:45,713
...without the safety... ...of a net!

829
00:36:05,012 --> 00:36:06,313
上场了

830
00:36:05,012 --> 00:36:06,313
Let's go.

831
00:36:06,313 --> 00:36:07,665
别紧张

832
00:36:06,313 --> 00:36:07,665
You'll be okay.

833
00:36:43,419 --> 00:36:47,132
各位女士先生

834
00:36:43,419 --> 00:36:47,132
Ladies... ...and gentlemen!

835
00:36:47,756 --> 00:36:50,859
新任马戏班主任现在请大家

836
00:36:47,756 --> 00:36:50,859
Now, the new management of the circus invites you to forget...

837
00:36:50,859 --> 00:36:53,729
暂时忘记这些有趣的表演

838
00:36:50,859 --> 00:36:53,729
...this good, wholesome fun...

839
00:36:53,729 --> 00:36:56,365
一起加入我们的混乱之夜

840
00:36:53,729 --> 00:36:56,365
...and join us in a celebration of chaos...

841
00:36:56,365 --> 00:36:58,618
拿上来

842
00:36:56,365 --> 00:36:58,618
...and true jesters!

843
00:36:59,335 --> 00:37:02,156
快点

844
00:36:59,335 --> 00:37:02,156
Bring it on! Now!

845
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:16,987
今晚我们准备了新点子

846
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:16,987
Tonight, a new act for your...

847
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:20,047
叫做巨蛋大屠杀

848
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:20,047
...personal amazement. We call it Massacre under the Big Top.

849
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:25,662
请注意场中可爱的大圆球

850
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:25,662
Let us direct your attention to the ring.

851
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:31,435
其中装了两百管TNT炸药

852
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:31,435
lnside this harmless-looking orb are two... ...that's two hundred sticks of TNT.

853
00:37:31,435 --> 00:37:37,924
遥控引爆信管就在我手中

854
00:37:31,435 --> 00:37:37,924
And in our innocent hand... ...a radio detonator.

855
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,944
你到底要怎样？

856
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,944
What do you want?

857
00:37:39,944 --> 00:37:41,612
要怎样？市长先生？

858
00:37:39,944 --> 00:37:41,612
Want, Mr. Mayor?

859
00:37:41,612 --> 00:37:43,614
我只要一个人-蝙蝠侠

860
00:37:41,612 --> 00:37:43,614
One simple thing: Batman.

861
00:37:43,614 --> 00:37:45,284
我要他肝脑涂地，血流五步

862
00:37:43,614 --> 00:37:45,284
Bruised, broken, bleeding...

863
00:37:45,284 --> 00:37:47,572
简而言之，要他死！

864
00:37:45,284 --> 00:37:47,572
...in a word: dead!

865
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,288
蝙蝠侠

866
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,288
Batman.

867
00:37:53,592 --> 00:37:55,252
今晚在场的

868
00:37:53,592 --> 00:37:55,252
Who do we have before us?

869
00:37:56,028 --> 00:37:58,864
都是高谭市有头有脸的大人物

870
00:37:56,028 --> 00:37:58,864
Gotham's finest... ...well-to-do...

871
00:37:58,864 --> 00:38:02,334
一定有人知道蝙蝠侠是谁

872
00:37:58,864 --> 00:38:02,334
...influential. Surely one of you knows who Batman is.

873
00:38:02,334 --> 00:38:06,224
搞不好蝙蝠侠就在你们之中

874
00:38:02,334 --> 00:38:06,224
Hell, odds are one of you pasty-faced twits is Batman!

875
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:09,835
给你们两分钟

876
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:09,835
You have two minutes.

877
00:38:15,715 --> 00:38:19,428
双面人！我就是蝙蝠侠

878
00:38:15,715 --> 00:38:19,428
Harvey! l'm Batman!

879
00:38:38,472 --> 00:38:39,540
我们来阻止他们

880
00:38:38,472 --> 00:38:39,540
We can stop them.

881
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,875
快上去

882
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,875
Go out on the rigging.

883
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:41,906
小心

884
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:41,906
Be careful.

885
00:38:41,942 --> 00:38:42,951
放心！

886
00:38:41,942 --> 00:38:42,951
Don't worry.

887
00:39:01,229 --> 00:39:03,068
上工了，小朋友们！

888
00:39:01,229 --> 00:39:03,068
Go to work, boys!

889
00:39:24,954 --> 00:39:27,066
今天真是个黄道吉日

890
00:39:24,954 --> 00:39:27,066
Our kind of day.

891
00:39:35,866 --> 00:39:37,811
快阻止它爆炸

892
00:39:35,866 --> 00:39:37,811
Reach for it! Stop it!

893
00:39:43,807 --> 00:39:44,779
天啊！

894
00:39:43,807 --> 00:39:44,779
Oh, my God.

895
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,915
谢谢您收容他

896
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,915
lt's good you took him in.

897
00:41:26,915 --> 00:41:28,451
这孩子没有任何亲人了

898
00:41:26,915 --> 00:41:28,451
He hasn't anyone now.

899
00:41:28,451 --> 00:41:30,786
他整天都在写调查报告

900
00:41:28,451 --> 00:41:30,786
He filled out papers all day.

901
00:41:30,786 --> 00:41:32,625
不吃不喝

902
00:41:30,786 --> 00:41:32,625
He hasn't slept or eaten.

903
00:41:44,033 --> 00:41:45,935
欢迎您，葛瑞森主人

904
00:41:44,033 --> 00:41:45,935
Welcome, Master Grayson.

905
00:41:45,935 --> 00:41:47,488
我叫阿福

906
00:41:45,935 --> 00:41:47,488
l'm Alfred.

907
00:41:47,503 --> 00:41:49,033
你好，阿福

908
00:41:47,503 --> 00:41:49,033
How you doing, Al?

909
00:41:50,573 --> 00:41:52,542
您的房间准备好了

910
00:41:50,573 --> 00:41:52,542
There's a room prepared for you.

911
00:41:52,542 --> 00:41:55,318
或者您想先吃点东西

912
00:41:52,542 --> 00:41:55,318
But perhaps you'd like to eat first.

913
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,878
好了，我要闪人了

914
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,878
Okay, l'm out of here.

915
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:02,403
什么？

916
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:02,403
Excuse me?

917
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:04,788
我骗条子我要住在这里

918
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:04,788
Telling that cop l'd stay here...

919
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:07,705
免得社工人员找我嗦

920
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:07,705
...saved me a lot of social service interviews.

921
00:42:08,258 --> 00:42:10,547
谢了，我闪了，再见

922
00:42:08,258 --> 00:42:10,547
So, no offense, but no thanks. See you.

923
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,334
保重了

924
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,334
Take it easy.

925
00:42:24,009 --> 00:42:26,999
你上哪儿？马戏团已经离开了

926
00:42:24,009 --> 00:42:26,999
Where will you go? The circus must be halfway to Metropolis.

927
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:29,702
我要找到双面人

928
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:29,702
Get a fix on Two-Face.

929
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:31,539
亲手杀了他

930
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:31,539
Then l'll kill him.

931
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:34,954
杀了双面人不会让你远离痛苦

932
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:34,954
Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away.

933
00:42:34,954 --> 00:42:36,522
只会越来越糟

934
00:42:34,954 --> 00:42:36,522
lt'll make it worse.

935
00:42:36,522 --> 00:42:39,119
少跟我打屁，拜！

936
00:42:36,522 --> 00:42:39,119
Spare me the sermons, all right?

937
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:42,237
我不用你来说教或同情

938
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:42,237
l don't need your advice or your charity.

939
00:42:43,596 --> 00:42:45,031
好酷的机车

940
00:42:43,596 --> 00:42:45,031
Nice bike.

941
00:42:45,031 --> 00:42:48,329
你也喜欢重型古董机车吗？

942
00:42:45,031 --> 00:42:48,329
Hang out at a lot of biker bars?

943
00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:51,356
你的油快没了

944
00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:51,356
You're almost on empty.

945
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,172
到车库加满油再走吧

946
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,172
Fill it up in the garage.

947
00:42:53,172 --> 00:42:55,390
方园十哩内可没有加油站

948
00:42:53,172 --> 00:42:55,390
There's no gas station for miles.

949
00:43:03,383 --> 00:43:04,913
加油枪在那儿

950
00:43:03,383 --> 00:43:04,913
Pump's over here.

951
00:43:05,085 --> 00:43:08,383
大哥，这是车库或汽车博物馆

952
00:43:05,085 --> 00:43:08,383
ls this a garage or a car museum, Bruce?

953
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:18,566
一九一七年的哈雷

954
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:18,566
A 1917 Harley.

955
00:43:18,566 --> 00:43:19,775
是的

956
00:43:18,566 --> 00:43:19,775
Yep.

957
00:43:19,966 --> 00:43:22,937
古典印地安型，完美如新

958
00:43:19,966 --> 00:43:22,937
lndian Classic, fully restored.

959
00:43:22,937 --> 00:43:25,606
这是文森黑骑士型

960
00:43:22,937 --> 00:43:25,606
This is a Vincent Black Knight.

961
00:43:25,606 --> 00:43:27,441
只生产了一百部

962
00:43:25,606 --> 00:43:27,441
They only made 100.

963
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:30,778
其实是一百零一部，我的最爱

964
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:30,778
A hundred and one, actually. She's my favorite.

965
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:32,513
你竟然有两部

966
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:32,513
You've got two.

967
00:43:32,513 --> 00:43:34,530
那一部故障了

968
00:43:32,513 --> 00:43:34,530
That one doesn't run.

969
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:37,051
这一部的节流阀堵住了

970
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:37,051
Throttle sticks on this one.

971
00:43:37,051 --> 00:43:39,153
阿福修车有一套

972
00:43:37,051 --> 00:43:39,153
Alfred's a good mechanic, but...

973
00:43:39,153 --> 00:43:40,823
不过这个工程浩大

974
00:43:39,153 --> 00:43:40,823
...these need a lot of work.

975
00:43:40,823 --> 00:43:43,592
谁能帮我修好它们

976
00:43:40,823 --> 00:43:43,592
Someone were to fix them up...

977
00:43:43,592 --> 00:43:45,359
我就送他一部

978
00:43:43,592 --> 00:43:45,359
...they could keep one.

979
00:43:47,763 --> 00:43:50,230
好了，祝旅程愉快

980
00:43:47,763 --> 00:43:50,230
Anyway... ...have a nice trip.

981
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,447
我想你会一切如意的

982
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,447
You'll land on your feet.

983
00:43:56,505 --> 00:44:00,008
小主人要走了吗？真可惜

984
00:43:56,505 --> 00:44:00,008
ls the young master leaving? Pity.

985
00:44:00,008 --> 00:44:04,908
那我把食物倒掉喂狗了

986
00:44:00,008 --> 00:44:04,908
l'll just toss this away then. Perhaps the dogs are hungry.

987
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,152
嘿，阿福，等等

988
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,152
Hey, Al, wait up.

989
00:44:09,152 --> 00:44:09,638
嘿，阿福，等等

990
00:44:09,152 --> 00:44:09,638
Hey, Al, wait up.

991
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:04,465
主人？

992
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:04,465
Master Bruce?

993
00:46:09,845 --> 00:46:11,541
和我父母一样

994
00:46:09,845 --> 00:46:11,541
Just like my parents.

995
00:46:12,214 --> 00:46:13,529
悲剧又再重演

996
00:46:12,214 --> 00:46:13,529
lt's happening again.

997
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:16,574
怪物从黑暗中出现

998
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:16,574
A monster comes out of the night,

999
00:46:16,586 --> 00:46:19,432
我听到尖叫，两声枪响

1000
00:46:16,586 --> 00:46:19,432
a scream, two shots.

1001
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:21,913
我杀了他们

1002
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:21,913
l killed them.

1003
00:46:22,258 --> 00:46:24,293
你说什么？

1004
00:46:22,258 --> 00:46:24,293
What did you say?

1005
00:46:24,293 --> 00:46:25,661
他杀了他们

1006
00:46:24,293 --> 00:46:25,661
He killed them.

1007
00:46:25,661 --> 00:46:26,963
双面人

1008
00:46:25,661 --> 00:46:26,963
Two-Face.

1009
00:46:26,963 --> 00:46:29,633
他杀了那孩子的父母

1010
00:46:26,963 --> 00:46:29,633
He slaughtered that boy's parents.

1011
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:31,133
不！不！

1012
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:31,133
No, no.

1013
00:46:31,133 --> 00:46:34,988
你刚刚说“我杀了他们”

1014
00:46:31,133 --> 00:46:34,988
You said, ''l killed them.''

1015
00:46:45,949 --> 00:46:47,646
好好照顾那孩子

1016
00:46:45,949 --> 00:46:47,646
Take care of the kid.

1017
00:46:47,818 --> 00:46:49,063
知道了，主人

1018
00:46:47,818 --> 00:46:49,063
Certainly, sir.

1019
00:46:57,194 --> 00:47:00,464
要我帮您拿行李吗？小主人

1020
00:46:57,194 --> 00:47:00,464
Can l help you settle in, Master Grayson?

1021
00:47:00,464 --> 00:47:04,319
不用，我一会儿自己来

1022
00:47:00,464 --> 00:47:04,319
No. Thanks, l won't be staying long.

1023
00:47:07,205 --> 00:47:09,910
这是知更鸟吗？

1024
00:47:07,205 --> 00:47:09,910
ls this a robin?

1025
00:47:12,144 --> 00:47:14,680
有一回我哥哥绳子断了

1026
00:47:12,144 --> 00:47:14,680
My brother's wire broke once

1027
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,549
我荡出去及时抓住了他

1028
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,549
and l swung out and grabbed him.

1029
00:47:17,549 --> 00:47:19,837
我老爸说我是大英雄

1030
00:47:17,549 --> 00:47:19,837
My father said l was his hero.

1031
00:47:20,953 --> 00:47:24,287
说我飞得活像只知更鸟

1032
00:47:20,953 --> 00:47:24,287
l flew in like a robin.

1033
00:47:25,524 --> 00:47:28,828
结果这英雄现在毫无用武之地

1034
00:47:25,524 --> 00:47:28,828
Some hero l turned out to be.

1035
00:47:28,828 --> 00:47:30,896
你父亲说得对

1036
00:47:28,828 --> 00:47:30,896
But your father was right.

1037
00:47:30,896 --> 00:47:34,087
你是个英雄，我感觉得到

1038
00:47:30,896 --> 00:47:34,087
You are a hero. l can tell.

1039
00:47:39,906 --> 00:47:44,842
请把这个丢了，我不需要它了

1040
00:47:39,906 --> 00:47:44,842
Throw this away, will you? l won't need it anymore.

1041
00:47:46,279 --> 00:47:49,304
我把它放在这里

1042
00:47:46,279 --> 00:47:49,304
l think l'll just put it in here.

1043
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:57,485
折翼即将复原

1044
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:57,485
Broken wings mend in time.

1045
00:47:58,759 --> 00:48:01,962
总有一天你会再度展翅高飞

1046
00:47:58,759 --> 00:48:01,962
One day Robin will fly again.

1047
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:02,898
我保证

1048
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:02,898
l promise.

1049
00:49:25,516 --> 00:49:26,690
我来开

1050
00:49:25,516 --> 00:49:26,690
We'll drive.

1051
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:02,199
叫“谜语大师”如何？

1052
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:02,199
The Puzzler?

1053
00:51:06,489 --> 00:51:08,601
叫“大老千”呢？

1054
00:51:06,489 --> 00:51:08,601
The Gamester?

1055
00:51:14,398 --> 00:51:16,379
“魔鬼杀手”呢？

1056
00:51:14,398 --> 00:51:16,379
Captain Kill?

1057
00:51:20,704 --> 00:51:23,030
“谜天大圣”呢？

1058
00:51:20,704 --> 00:51:23,030
Question Mark Man?

1059
00:51:40,457 --> 00:51:42,439
谢了，太感激了

1060
00:51:40,457 --> 00:51:42,439
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1061
00:51:56,675 --> 00:52:00,913
怎样都动不了那蝙蝠一根汗毛

1062
00:51:56,675 --> 00:52:00,913
The Bat's stubborn refusal to expire...

1063
00:52:00,913 --> 00:52:03,096
简直令我抓狂

1064
00:52:00,913 --> 00:52:03,096
...is driving us insane!

1065
00:52:06,185 --> 00:52:07,774
别烦心了，宝贝

1066
00:52:06,185 --> 00:52:07,774
Don't worry, baby.

1067
00:52:09,521 --> 00:52:11,774
你马上可以宰了他

1068
00:52:09,521 --> 00:52:11,774
You'll kill him soon.

1069
00:52:16,295 --> 00:52:20,053
我替你准备了大餐

1070
00:52:16,295 --> 00:52:20,053
Besides... ...l made your favorite.

1071
00:52:20,267 --> 00:52:24,070
香槟、鲑鱼

1072
00:52:20,267 --> 00:52:24,070
Sparkling champagne and... ...yummy poached salmon with little quail eggs and a...

1073
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:28,814
鹌鹑蛋

1074
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:28,814
...creamy...

1075
00:52:28,814 --> 00:52:30,095
幻想

1076
00:52:28,814 --> 00:52:30,095
...dreamy...

1077
00:52:30,182 --> 00:52:31,950
还有香喷喷的柠檬蛋酥

1078
00:52:30,182 --> 00:52:31,950
...lemon souffle.

1079
00:52:32,812 --> 00:52:35,682
我这边的才叫做大餐

1080
00:52:32,812 --> 00:52:35,682
No, l made your favorite.

1081
00:52:35,682 --> 00:52:37,851
炭烤野猪心

1082
00:52:35,682 --> 00:52:37,851
A charred heart of black boar...

1083
00:52:37,851 --> 00:52:40,320
野驴肉

1084
00:52:37,851 --> 00:52:40,320
...a side of raw donkey meat...

1085
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:45,492
还有不加冰的超级够劲烈酒

1086
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:45,492
...and a Sterno and grain alcohol, straight up, baby!

1087
00:52:46,594 --> 00:52:47,928
太完美了

1088
00:52:46,594 --> 00:52:47,928
Perfect!

1089
00:52:47,928 --> 00:52:49,764
女士们，你们把我们宠坏了

1090
00:52:47,928 --> 00:52:49,764
Ladies, you spoil us!

1091
00:52:49,764 --> 00:52:53,200
我们还没决定先吃那一边

1092
00:52:49,764 --> 00:52:53,200
We're of two minds about what to eat first.

1093
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,536
什么声音？

1094
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,536
What?!

1095
00:52:54,536 --> 00:52:56,805
希望你有替我多留一份

1096
00:52:54,536 --> 00:52:56,805
l hope you made extra.

1097
00:52:56,805 --> 00:52:58,643
你到底是谁？

1098
00:52:56,805 --> 00:52:58,643
Who the hell are you?

1099
00:52:59,407 --> 00:53:00,866
只是一个朋友

1100
00:52:59,407 --> 00:53:00,866
Just a friend.

1101
00:53:01,043 --> 00:53:05,491
不过你可以叫我“谜天大圣”

1102
00:53:01,043 --> 00:53:05,491
But you can call me......The Riddler.

1103
00:53:07,749 --> 00:53:09,584
听起来像是死人名字

1104
00:53:07,749 --> 00:53:09,584
l'll call you dead, is more like it!

1105
00:53:09,584 --> 00:53:11,921
说，你怎么找到我们？

1106
00:53:09,584 --> 00:53:11,921
How did you find us? Talk!

1107
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:15,057
我说了你会放了我吗？

1108
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:15,057
But then if l talked what would keep you from slaying me, O Segregated One?

1109
00:53:15,057 --> 00:53:20,227
心眼小难怪脸永远好不了

1110
00:53:15,057 --> 00:53:20,227
That's never going to heal if you don't stop picking.

1111
00:53:21,263 --> 00:53:24,810
我倒要看看你的血是绿色的吗

1112
00:53:21,263 --> 00:53:24,810
Let's see if you bleed green.

1113
00:53:25,034 --> 00:53:27,774
你想杀的人可不是我

1114
00:53:25,034 --> 00:53:27,774
lt's not me you want to kill.

1115
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:33,480
取我小命对你们而言太容易了

1116
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:33,480
That's just too easy for someone as powerful as you and... ...you.

1117
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:39,385
杀了蝙蝠侠，那才够气派

1118
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:39,385
But Batman... ...there's a challenge.

1119
00:53:39,615 --> 00:53:42,719
宰了那只蝙蝠，听起来不赖

1120
00:53:39,615 --> 00:53:42,719
Kill the Bat! Sounds like a good idea.

1121
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,087
但你想过吗？

1122
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,087
But have you thought it through?

1123
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:48,359
几发子弹，血溅五步，然后呢

1124
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:48,359
A few bullets, a splash of blood, then what?

1125
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:51,296
只是弄脏你的手

1126
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:51,296
Wet hands.

1127
00:53:51,296 --> 00:53:54,842
还会染上杀人后的忧郁症

1128
00:53:51,296 --> 00:53:54,842
Post-homicidal depression.

1129
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:59,865
何不先侮辱他一番

1130
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:59,865
Why not humiliate him first? Yeah.

1131
00:53:59,971 --> 00:54:03,908
找出他的弱点，在他最脆弱时

1132
00:53:59,971 --> 00:54:03,908
Expose his frailties. Then, when he is at his weakest...

1133
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:06,506
给他致命一击

1134
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:06,506
...crush him!

1135
00:54:07,812 --> 00:54:11,975
你的左眼正在闪闪发光

1136
00:54:07,812 --> 00:54:11,975
l see that... ...sparkle in your left eye.

1137
00:54:12,884 --> 00:54:16,359
我可以帮你逮到蝙蝠侠

1138
00:54:12,884 --> 00:54:16,359
l can help you get Batman.

1139
00:54:18,591 --> 00:54:23,941
不过你得饶了我这条小命

1140
00:54:18,591 --> 00:54:23,941
That is, if you'll... ...spare my life for just a few moments.

1141
00:54:34,473 --> 00:54:35,481
谢了

1142
00:54:34,473 --> 00:54:35,481
Thank you.

1143
00:54:36,443 --> 00:54:38,661
我喜欢你的装潢

1144
00:54:36,443 --> 00:54:38,661
l love what you've done here.

1145
00:54:38,778 --> 00:54:41,067
有后现代主义的风格

1146
00:54:38,778 --> 00:54:41,067
Heavy Metal meets House and Garden.

1147
00:54:42,848 --> 00:54:43,916
太美了

1148
00:54:42,848 --> 00:54:43,916
Beautiful.

1149
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:49,271
一边是黑暗、野蛮、颓废

1150
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:49,271
lt's so dark and Gothic and... ...disgustingly decadent.

1151
00:54:50,924 --> 00:54:53,913
一边却如此明亮、活泼

1152
00:54:50,924 --> 00:54:53,913
Yet so bright and chipper and...

1153
00:54:55,228 --> 00:54:56,509
优雅保守

1154
00:54:55,228 --> 00:54:56,509
...conservative.

1155
00:55:00,767 --> 00:55:03,371
正是你的个性

1156
00:55:00,767 --> 00:55:03,371
lt's so you!

1157
00:55:03,371 --> 00:55:05,696
完完全全的你

1158
00:55:03,371 --> 00:55:05,696
And yet, so you!

1159
00:55:07,408 --> 00:55:10,845
很少人能像你一样完美地

1160
00:55:07,408 --> 00:55:10,845
Very few people are both a summer and a winter, but...

1161
00:55:10,845 --> 00:55:14,558
融合了两种极端的品味

1162
00:55:10,845 --> 00:55:14,558
...but you pull it off nicely.

1163
00:55:16,552 --> 00:55:18,105
讲重点

1164
00:55:16,552 --> 00:55:18,105
What's the point?

1165
00:55:19,121 --> 00:55:20,621
有没有人告诉你

1166
00:55:19,121 --> 00:55:20,621
Has anyone ever told you

1167
00:55:20,621 --> 00:55:24,026
你有严重的乱抓狂毛病

1168
00:55:20,621 --> 00:55:24,026
you have a serious impulse-control problem?!

1169
00:55:25,294 --> 00:55:28,283
这就是重点

1170
00:55:25,294 --> 00:55:28,283
This is the point.

1171
00:55:40,143 --> 00:55:44,247
我来示范我是如何找到你的

1172
00:55:40,143 --> 00:55:44,247
This is how l found you. Let me demonstrate.

1173
00:55:50,153 --> 00:55:51,742
这是你的脑

1174
00:55:50,153 --> 00:55:51,742
This is your brain on the Box.

1175
00:55:52,589 --> 00:55:54,533
这是小弟我的脑

1176
00:55:52,589 --> 00:55:54,533
This is my brain.

1177
00:55:54,624 --> 00:55:57,056
有没有人还要玩吗？

1178
00:55:54,624 --> 00:55:57,056
Does anyone else feel like a fried egg?

1179
00:55:57,193 --> 00:55:58,688
我还要再玩

1180
00:55:57,193 --> 00:55:58,688
l'll have more.

1181
00:55:59,129 --> 00:56:02,011
没问题，不过要收费

1182
00:55:59,129 --> 00:56:02,011
There's more. But only the first one's free.

1183
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:04,934
我们来谈条件

1184
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:04,934
Here's the bargain:

1185
00:56:04,934 --> 00:56:07,670
你帮我找资金来生产这机器

1186
00:56:04,934 --> 00:56:07,670
You'll help me steal production capital...

1187
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:10,808
我让城市每部电视都装上它

1188
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:10,808
...so l can put a Box on every TV in town...

1189
00:56:10,808 --> 00:56:16,013
我就成了高谭市最聪明的生物

1190
00:56:10,808 --> 00:56:16,013
...and become Gotham's cleverest carbon-based life form!

1191
00:56:16,013 --> 00:56:19,275
为了报答你们...

1192
00:56:16,013 --> 00:56:19,275
And in return....

1193
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:22,219
你们有听好吗？

1194
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:22,219
ls everybody paying attention?

1195
00:56:22,219 --> 00:56:25,122
我会帮你解出世纪之谜

1196
00:56:22,219 --> 00:56:25,122
l will help you solve the greatest riddle of all.

1197
00:56:25,122 --> 00:56:27,234
有史以来最大的谜

1198
00:56:25,122 --> 00:56:27,234
The mother of all riddles:

1199
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:32,075
蝙蝠侠是何方神圣

1200
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:32,075
Who is... ...Batman?

1201
00:56:33,865 --> 00:56:36,201
你擅闯我秘密基地

1202
00:56:33,865 --> 00:56:36,201
You broke into our hideout.

1203
00:56:36,201 --> 00:56:38,870
破坏这块净土的圣洁

1204
00:56:36,201 --> 00:56:38,870
You violated the sanctity of our lair.

1205
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:41,707
本该把你碎尸万段

1206
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:41,707
We should crush your bones into powder.

1207
00:56:41,707 --> 00:56:43,976
不过看在你点子不错的份上

1208
00:56:41,707 --> 00:56:43,976
But you pose an interesting proposition.

1209
00:56:43,976 --> 00:56:46,311
丢铜板决定，大头朝上放了你

1210
00:56:43,976 --> 00:56:46,311
Therefore, heads, we accept,

1211
00:56:46,311 --> 00:56:48,130
字朝上你就认命受死吧

1212
00:56:46,311 --> 00:56:48,130
and tails, we blow your damn head off.

1213
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,862
这一颗不错

1214
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,862
Here's a good one.

1215
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:07,625
不对不对

1216
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:07,625
No, no, no!

1217
00:57:07,834 --> 00:57:09,778
这一颗更好

1218
00:57:07,834 --> 00:57:09,778
There is a good one.

1219
00:57:11,405 --> 00:57:13,730
放着就好，我来晾

1220
00:57:11,405 --> 00:57:13,730
-Leave that. l'll attend to it.

1221
00:57:13,807 --> 00:57:15,990
我可不习惯被人伺候

1222
00:57:13,807 --> 00:57:15,990
-l'm not used to being waited on.

1223
00:57:40,936 --> 00:57:42,137
不要开枪

1224
00:57:40,936 --> 00:57:42,137
Don't shoot me!

1225
00:57:42,137 --> 00:57:44,948
发什么楞，拿来

1226
00:57:42,137 --> 00:57:44,948
Don't eyeball me! Give me that!

1227
00:57:48,143 --> 00:57:50,879
双面人，教我怎么揍人

1228
00:57:48,143 --> 00:57:50,879
Two-Face, show me how to punch a guy!

1229
00:57:50,879 --> 00:57:54,049
简单得很，握拳、往后拉

1230
00:57:50,879 --> 00:57:54,049
lt's dead simple, my boy. Ball up your fist, reach back...

1231
00:57:54,049 --> 00:57:55,602
再用力打出去

1232
00:57:54,049 --> 00:57:55,602
...and assert yourself.

1233
00:57:57,353 --> 00:57:59,465
有意思，我试试

1234
00:57:57,353 --> 00:57:59,465
That looks fun. Let me try.

1235
00:58:00,356 --> 00:58:03,939
握拳、往后拉，用力打出去

1236
00:58:00,356 --> 00:58:03,939
Ball up the fist, reach way back ...assert yourself.

1237
00:58:08,531 --> 00:58:11,307
十万零两百二十

1238
00:58:08,531 --> 00:58:11,307
One hundred thousand, two hundred and twenty.

1239
00:58:11,934 --> 00:58:13,986
十万零...

1240
00:58:11,934 --> 00:58:13,986
One hundred and....

1241
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:15,386
又数乱了

1242
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:15,386
l lost count!

1243
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:21,645
昨夜绿衣抢匪再度犯案

1244
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:21,645
Last night another robbery, perpetrated by the green-suited menace...

1245
00:58:21,645 --> 00:58:23,747
数百万元钻石遭窃

1246
00:58:21,645 --> 00:58:23,747
...resulting in millions in diamonds stolen,

1247
00:58:23,747 --> 00:58:25,582
蝙蝠侠并未出现

1248
00:58:23,747 --> 00:58:25,582
with no sign of Batman.

1249
00:58:25,582 --> 00:58:30,220
匪徒作案习惯在现场留下谜语

1250
00:58:25,582 --> 00:58:30,220
This new criminal's pattern of marking his crimes with puzzles...

1251
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:33,491
市井间以“谜天大圣”称呼之

1252
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:33,491
...has Gothamites calling him The Riddler.

1253
00:58:33,491 --> 00:58:37,128
显然他是你和蝙蝠侠的公敌

1254
00:58:33,491 --> 00:58:37,128
Apparently, you and Batman have a common enemy.

1255
00:58:37,128 --> 00:58:39,702
这是一早送来的新谜语

1256
00:58:37,128 --> 00:58:39,702
That was with the morning mail.

1257
00:58:41,433 --> 00:58:43,802
八条好汉勇往直前

1258
00:58:41,433 --> 00:58:43,802
''The eight of us go forth, not back,

1259
00:58:43,802 --> 00:58:45,103
不回头

1260
00:58:43,802 --> 00:58:45,103
to protect our king...

1261
00:58:45,103 --> 00:58:47,048
一心护主公

1262
00:58:45,103 --> 00:58:47,048
''...from attack.''

1263
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:48,260
西洋棋的卒子

1264
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:48,260
Chess pawns.

1265
00:58:48,373 --> 00:58:49,541
时钟

1266
00:58:48,373 --> 00:58:49,541
Clock.

1267
00:58:49,541 --> 00:58:50,475
火柴

1268
00:58:49,541 --> 00:58:50,475
Matches.

1269
00:58:50,475 --> 00:58:52,278
都是人造的物件

1270
00:58:50,475 --> 00:58:52,278
All man-made objects.

1271
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:54,728
体积小，重量轻

1272
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:54,728
Small in size, light in weight.

1273
00:58:54,913 --> 00:58:56,466
之间有何关联？

1274
00:58:54,913 --> 00:58:56,466
What's the connection?

1275
00:58:56,615 --> 00:59:00,329
这就是他外号谜天大圣的原因

1276
00:58:56,615 --> 00:59:00,329
With all due respect, that's why they call him The Riddler.

1277
00:59:03,021 --> 00:59:04,856
有事要我效劳吗？

1278
00:59:03,021 --> 00:59:04,856
May l help you?

1279
00:59:04,856 --> 00:59:07,492
为什么只有这门上了锁？

1280
00:59:04,856 --> 00:59:07,492
Why is this the only locked door?

1281
00:59:07,492 --> 00:59:09,327
门后是什么？

1282
00:59:07,492 --> 00:59:09,327
What's back there?

1283
00:59:09,327 --> 00:59:12,387
主人韦恩死去的太太

1284
00:59:09,327 --> 00:59:12,387
Master Wayne's dead wives.

1285
00:59:12,665 --> 00:59:15,405
那是放银器的柜子

1286
00:59:12,665 --> 00:59:15,405
The silver closet. On your way.

1287
00:59:18,504 --> 00:59:22,075
现在各位可以体验伟大的科技

1288
00:59:18,504 --> 00:59:22,075
Now, you can be part of the action!

1289
00:59:22,075 --> 00:59:24,478
尼格玛科技集团让您在家中

1290
00:59:22,075 --> 00:59:24,478
Nygma Tech brings the joy of 3-D

1291
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,731
享受3D立体声光娱乐

1292
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,731
entertainment into your home!

1293
00:59:27,447 --> 00:59:32,527
各位，我们的理想

1294
00:59:27,447 --> 00:59:32,527
Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you... ...my vision.

1295
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,790
这魔幻宝盒享誉全美

1296
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,790
The Box in every home in America...

1297
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:39,115
即将风行全世界

1298
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:39,115
...and one day, the world!

1299
00:59:39,259 --> 00:59:42,297
本地消息，艾德华的魔幻宝盒

1300
00:59:39,259 --> 00:59:42,297
ln local news, Edward Nygma's 3-D Box...

1301
00:59:42,297 --> 00:59:44,965
已在本市掀起购买热潮

1302
00:59:42,297 --> 00:59:44,965
...has become the rage of Gotham.

1303
00:59:44,965 --> 00:59:49,636
昨晚所有家电行被抢购一空

1304
00:59:44,965 --> 00:59:49,636
Rioting occurred last night at electronic stores that were sold out.

1305
00:59:49,636 --> 00:59:53,112
几乎全市每户皆有安装

1306
00:59:49,636 --> 00:59:53,112
There is hardly a home without the Nygma Tech Box.

1307
00:59:53,541 --> 00:59:57,011
评论家认为这是机械化的沉沦

1308
00:59:53,541 --> 00:59:57,011
Critics claim the Box turns Gothamites into zombies.

1309
00:59:57,011 --> 00:59:59,013
但艾德华本人有不同看法

1310
00:59:57,011 --> 00:59:59,013
But Edward Nygma just shrugs.

1311
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:01,824
电视发明时，他们也是这么说

1312
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:01,824
''That's what they said when TV was invented.''

1313
01:00:44,661 --> 01:00:46,393
小主人

1314
01:00:44,661 --> 01:00:46,393
Master Dick!

1315
01:00:47,831 --> 01:00:49,384
在这儿

1316
01:00:47,831 --> 01:00:49,384
Up here.

1317
01:00:50,033 --> 01:00:52,915
没什么事，小主人

1318
01:00:50,033 --> 01:00:52,915
Just checking, young sir.

1319
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:26,408
遭非法闯入，注意！

1320
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:26,408
lntruder alert. lntruder alert.

1321
01:01:51,898 --> 01:01:55,269
我有东西给你，在桌上

1322
01:01:51,898 --> 01:01:55,269
l have something for you. lt's on the table.

1323
01:01:55,269 --> 01:01:57,487
希望你会喜欢

1324
01:01:55,269 --> 01:01:57,487
l hope you like it.

1325
01:02:07,848 --> 01:02:10,951
这是出于专业上的直觉

1326
01:02:07,848 --> 01:02:10,951
Call it clinical intuition.

1327
01:02:10,951 --> 01:02:14,142
你的梦境需要改变一下

1328
01:02:10,951 --> 01:02:14,142
l thought your dreams needed changing.

1329
01:02:16,258 --> 01:02:19,361
我父母在我眼前遭人杀害

1330
01:02:16,258 --> 01:02:19,361
My parents were murdered before me...

1331
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:21,934
当时我只是个孩子

1332
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:21,934
...when l was a kid.

1333
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:28,670
详细经过我记不太清楚

1334
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:28,670
l don't... ...remember a lot of what happened, but...

1335
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:33,908
但在梦境中却历历在目

1336
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:33,908
...what l do comes to me in my dreams. Flashes.

1337
01:02:34,277 --> 01:02:38,281
最近梦中却出现一些新的内容

1338
01:02:34,277 --> 01:02:38,281
There's a new element now though, l haven't seen before.

1339
01:02:38,281 --> 01:02:41,507
是一本红皮册子

1340
01:02:38,281 --> 01:02:41,507
lt's a red leather book.

1341
01:02:41,784 --> 01:02:44,145
新的梦境

1342
01:02:41,784 --> 01:02:44,145
Something else....

1343
01:02:44,487 --> 01:02:48,124
甚至连我醒时都常会作这些梦

1344
01:02:44,487 --> 01:02:48,124
My dreams come to me when l'm awake now.

1345
01:02:48,124 --> 01:02:51,594
布鲁斯，这是你压抑下的记忆

1346
01:02:48,124 --> 01:02:51,594
Bruce, you're describing repressed memories.

1347
01:02:51,594 --> 01:02:57,751
记忆深处的痛苦会试着被释放

1348
01:02:51,594 --> 01:02:57,751
lmages of a forgotten pain that's trying to surface.

1349
01:02:58,968 --> 01:03:00,213
我马上回来

1350
01:02:58,968 --> 01:03:00,213
l'll be right back.

1351
01:03:13,484 --> 01:03:16,959
蝙蝠侠法外锄奸令人争议

1352
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:22,226
精神分裂诊断书

1353
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:22,226
ls there an aspect of your

1354
01:03:22,226 --> 01:03:23,886
关于你父母之死

1355
01:03:22,226 --> 01:03:23,886
parents' death you haven't faced?

1356
01:03:23,895 --> 01:03:25,863
是否有什么你不敢面对的

1357
01:03:23,895 --> 01:03:25,863
You were so young

1358
01:03:25,863 --> 01:03:28,010
当时你还很小

1359
01:03:25,863 --> 01:03:28,010
when it happened.

1360
01:03:28,299 --> 01:03:31,940
也许我该让你专心研究蝙蝠侠

1361
01:03:28,299 --> 01:03:31,940
Maybe l should leave you two alone.

1362
01:03:32,037 --> 01:03:36,520
这该不会只是把公事带回家吧

1363
01:03:32,037 --> 01:03:36,520
This goes way beyond taking your work home, doesn't it?

1364
01:03:38,577 --> 01:03:39,964
好吧

1365
01:03:38,577 --> 01:03:39,964
All right.

1366
01:03:41,947 --> 01:03:43,999
我承认他够刺激

1367
01:03:41,947 --> 01:03:43,999
l think he's fascinating.

1368
01:03:44,316 --> 01:03:46,085
心理学角度上的

1369
01:03:44,316 --> 01:03:46,085
Clinically.

1370
01:03:46,085 --> 01:03:48,446
为什么一个男人会这么做？

1371
01:03:46,085 --> 01:03:48,446
Why does a man do this?

1372
01:03:48,921 --> 01:03:51,190
仿佛受到诅咒般在赎罪

1373
01:03:48,921 --> 01:03:51,190
lt's as if he's cursed to pay penance.

1374
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:53,258
他到底犯了什么错

1375
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:53,258
What crime could he have committed to

1376
01:03:53,258 --> 01:03:57,163
注定要在夜间出没受惩罚

1377
01:03:53,258 --> 01:03:57,163
deserve a life of nightly torture?

1378
01:03:57,163 --> 01:04:02,516
只是专业上的好奇吗？慈丝？

1379
01:03:57,163 --> 01:04:02,516
lt's more than just... ...professional interest, isn't it, Chase?

1380
01:04:03,336 --> 01:04:05,388
你在吃醋吗？

1381
01:04:03,336 --> 01:04:05,388
Bruce, are you jealous?

1382
01:04:05,939 --> 01:04:11,704
不，我无法吃蝙蝠侠的醋

1383
01:04:05,939 --> 01:04:11,704
No. l can't be jealous of Batman.

1384
01:04:11,845 --> 01:04:16,329
我想亲近你，你却拒人千里

1385
01:04:11,845 --> 01:04:16,329
l want to be close, but you won't let me near.

1386
01:04:16,517 --> 01:04:20,020
有什么不想让我知道的吗？

1387
01:04:16,517 --> 01:04:20,020
What are you protecting me from?

1388
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:22,456
想知道原因吗？

1389
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:22,456
Do you want to know me?

1390
01:04:22,456 --> 01:04:24,887
你知道我是谁吗？

1391
01:04:22,456 --> 01:04:24,887
Do you want to know who l am?

1392
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:30,986
我想我们都有两种面貌

1393
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:30,986
l guess... ...we're all two people.

1394
01:04:32,133 --> 01:04:36,704
外表所呈现的 和内心真实的自我

1395
01:04:32,133 --> 01:04:36,704
One daylight, and the one we keep in shadow.

1396
01:04:36,704 --> 01:04:41,206
愤怒、暴力、激情

1397
01:04:36,704 --> 01:04:41,206
Rage... ...violence... ...passion.

1398
01:04:45,647 --> 01:04:46,750
对不起

1399
01:04:45,647 --> 01:04:46,750
Excuse me.

1400
01:04:48,716 --> 01:04:49,684
我正在忙

1401
01:04:48,716 --> 01:04:49,684
l'm busy.

1402
01:04:49,684 --> 01:04:54,389
抱歉打扰你，小主人惹麻烦了

1403
01:04:49,684 --> 01:04:54,389
l'm sorry to bother you. l have some distressing news about Dick.

1404
01:04:54,389 --> 01:04:55,991
他还好吧？

1405
01:04:54,389 --> 01:04:55,991
ls he okay?

1406
01:04:55,991 --> 01:04:58,696
他出门了

1407
01:04:55,991 --> 01:04:58,696
l'm afraid Master Dick has gone traveling.

1408
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:01,163
离家出走吗？

1409
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:01,163
He ran away?

1410
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:04,467
事实上，他把车开走了

1411
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:04,467
Actually, he took the car.

1412
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:06,469
把积架开走吗？

1413
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:06,469
He boosted the Jag?

1414
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:08,071
不是那部积架

1415
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:08,071
Not the Jaguar.

1416
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:09,572
另一部车

1417
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:09,572
The other car.

1418
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:10,907
班特利吗？

1419
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:10,907
Bentley? No, sir.

1420
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:14,976
不，主人，是“另外”一部车

1421
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:14,976
The other car.

1422
01:05:45,043 --> 01:05:48,791
小妞们，要去兜兜风吗？

1423
01:05:45,043 --> 01:05:48,791
Go for a little ride in my love machine, babies?

1424
01:05:53,551 --> 01:05:55,054
是蝙蝠侠

1425
01:05:53,551 --> 01:05:55,054
lt's Batman!

1426
01:05:55,054 --> 01:05:57,521
快开门，蝙蝠侠

1427
01:05:55,054 --> 01:05:57,521
Open up, Batman.

1428
01:05:58,756 --> 01:06:00,825
等等，他不是蝙蝠侠

1429
01:05:58,756 --> 01:06:00,825
Wait! That's not Batman!

1430
01:06:00,825 --> 01:06:02,393
你说什么？

1431
01:06:00,825 --> 01:06:02,393
What do you mean?

1432
01:06:02,393 --> 01:06:04,789
他是蝙蝠弟弟

1433
01:06:02,393 --> 01:06:04,789
That's Batboy!

1434
01:06:05,064 --> 01:06:07,080
不是蝙蝠侠本人嘛

1435
01:06:05,064 --> 01:06:07,080
lt ain't the Bat!

1436
01:06:29,756 --> 01:06:31,144
放了她

1437
01:06:29,756 --> 01:06:31,144
Let her go!

1438
01:06:38,865 --> 01:06:41,134
你是什么东西？

1439
01:06:38,865 --> 01:06:41,134
Who the hell are you?

1440
01:06:41,134 --> 01:06:43,387
在下蝙蝠侠

1441
01:06:41,134 --> 01:06:43,387
l'm Batman.

1442
01:06:44,772 --> 01:06:48,106
我忘了穿蝙蝠装，不行吗？

1443
01:06:44,772 --> 01:06:48,106
l forgot my suit, all right?

1444
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:28,444
快走

1445
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:28,444
Come on, run!

1446
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:31,668
蝙蝠侠不和女士吻别吗？

1447
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:31,668
Doesn't Batman ever kiss the girl?

1448
01:07:33,456 --> 01:07:34,487
走！

1449
01:07:33,456 --> 01:07:34,487
Go!

1450
01:07:34,657 --> 01:07:36,659
谢了，你救了我

1451
01:07:34,657 --> 01:07:36,659
Thanks, you saved my life!

1452
01:07:36,659 --> 01:07:40,728
看来我天生是当超级英雄的料

1453
01:07:36,659 --> 01:07:40,728
l could definitely get into this superhero gig.

1454
01:08:03,355 --> 01:08:05,015
蝙蝠侠来了！

1455
01:08:03,355 --> 01:08:05,015
Batman!

1456
01:08:18,403 --> 01:08:19,904
你可恶！

1457
01:08:18,403 --> 01:08:19,904
Bastard!

1458
01:08:19,904 --> 01:08:21,907
我家人成了你的替死鬼

1459
01:08:19,904 --> 01:08:21,907
lt should've been you!

1460
01:08:21,907 --> 01:08:25,177
当时你向双面人承认是你

1461
01:08:21,907 --> 01:08:25,177
lf you had told Two-Face who you were at the circus...

1462
01:08:25,177 --> 01:08:28,202
他们就都不会死了

1463
01:08:25,177 --> 01:08:28,202
...they'd still be alive!

1464
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:33,819
若能以布鲁斯韦恩的命来交换

1465
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:33,819
lf Bruce Wayne could've given his life for your family

1466
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:35,207
他会乐意的

1467
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:35,207
he would have.

1468
01:08:40,893 --> 01:08:44,571
我现在一心只想杀双面人

1469
01:08:40,893 --> 01:08:44,571
All l can think about every day is getting Two-Face.

1470
01:08:45,465 --> 01:08:47,861
他毁了我的一生

1471
01:08:45,465 --> 01:08:47,861
He took my whole life.

1472
01:08:49,503 --> 01:08:51,605
今晚我在干架时

1473
01:08:49,503 --> 01:08:51,605
When l was out there tonight...

1474
01:08:51,605 --> 01:08:54,241
都把对手当成是他

1475
01:08:51,605 --> 01:08:54,241
...l imagined it was him l was fighting...

1476
01:08:54,241 --> 01:08:57,231
连我在捶你时也一样

1477
01:08:54,241 --> 01:08:57,231
...even when l was fighting you...

1478
01:08:57,278 --> 01:09:00,232
浑然忘了肉体的痛苦

1479
01:08:57,278 --> 01:09:00,232
...and the pain went away.

1480
01:09:00,281 --> 01:09:01,977
你了解吗？

1481
01:09:00,281 --> 01:09:01,977
Do you understand?

1482
01:09:01,982 --> 01:09:03,642
我了解

1483
01:09:01,982 --> 01:09:03,642
Yes, l do.

1484
01:09:03,651 --> 01:09:07,755
很好，你一定得帮我找到他

1485
01:09:03,651 --> 01:09:07,755
Good. You must help me find him.

1486
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:08,949
那以后

1487
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:08,949
When we do...

1488
01:09:09,424 --> 01:09:11,820
我要亲手宰了他

1489
01:09:09,424 --> 01:09:11,820
...l'm the one who kills him.

1490
01:09:13,261 --> 01:09:16,531
这是你一生的目标吗？

1491
01:09:13,261 --> 01:09:16,531
So, you're willing to take a life?

1492
01:09:16,531 --> 01:09:19,793
是的，亲手杀了双面人

1493
01:09:16,531 --> 01:09:19,793
As long as it's Two-Face.

1494
01:09:21,069 --> 01:09:24,747
然后事情就像这样

1495
01:09:21,069 --> 01:09:24,747
Then it will happen this way:

1496
01:09:24,773 --> 01:09:30,979
你杀了双面人，痛苦却未远离

1497
01:09:24,773 --> 01:09:30,979
you make the kill. And your pain doesn't die with Harvey, it grows.

1498
01:09:30,979 --> 01:09:33,552
反而与日俱增

1499
01:09:30,979 --> 01:09:33,552
So you run into the night to find another face, and another...

1500
01:09:34,015 --> 01:09:37,886
夜复一夜，你不断借杀伐解脱

1501
01:09:34,015 --> 01:09:37,886
...and another...

1502
01:09:37,886 --> 01:09:40,255
直到有一天你醒来

1503
01:09:37,886 --> 01:09:40,255
...until one terrible morning you wake up and realize...

1504
01:09:40,255 --> 01:09:44,393
你将发现复仇成了生命的全部

1505
01:09:40,255 --> 01:09:44,393
...that revenge has become your whole life...

1506
01:09:44,393 --> 01:09:47,497
而你却无法自拔

1507
01:09:44,393 --> 01:09:47,497
...and you won't know why.

1508
01:09:47,497 --> 01:09:49,532
你不了解

1509
01:09:47,497 --> 01:09:49,532
You can't understand.

1510
01:09:49,532 --> 01:09:53,402
你家人又没有被疯子杀掉

1511
01:09:49,532 --> 01:09:53,402
Your family wasn't killed by a maniac.

1512
01:09:53,402 --> 01:09:56,239
他们就是这么死的

1513
01:09:53,402 --> 01:09:56,239
Yes, they were.

1514
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:58,108
我们同痛相怜

1515
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:58,108
We're the same.

1516
01:09:58,108 --> 01:10:00,343
既然如此，请帮助我，训练我

1517
01:09:58,108 --> 01:10:00,343
lf we're the same, help me. Train me,

1518
01:10:00,343 --> 01:10:02,395
我来做你的最佳拍档

1519
01:10:00,343 --> 01:10:02,395
let me be your partner.

1520
01:10:04,615 --> 01:10:05,718
不行

1521
01:10:04,615 --> 01:10:05,718
No.

1522
01:10:06,483 --> 01:10:10,253
你仍有选择余地

1523
01:10:06,483 --> 01:10:10,253
l can't. You still have a choice.

1524
01:10:11,121 --> 01:10:15,190
不管怎样，反正我跟定你了！

1525
01:10:11,121 --> 01:10:15,190
Look, Bruce... ...l'm a part of this, like it or not.

1526
01:10:33,111 --> 01:10:36,948
今晚本市社交界的盛会

1527
01:10:33,111 --> 01:10:36,948
Tonight all of Gotham society has turned out for Edward Nygma's...

1528
01:10:36,948 --> 01:10:40,661
艾德华将发表魔幻宝盒第二代

1529
01:10:36,948 --> 01:10:40,661
...gala unveiling of his New lmproved Box.

1530
01:10:41,853 --> 01:10:43,155
谢了，阿福

1531
01:10:41,853 --> 01:10:43,155
Thanks, Al.

1532
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:44,258
不客气

1533
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:44,258
My pleasure, sir.

1534
01:10:44,289 --> 01:10:46,092
名人们将畅饮狂舞

1535
01:10:44,289 --> 01:10:46,092
They'll be dining and dancing the night away...

1536
01:10:46,092 --> 01:10:50,125
享受高谭亚都饭店的顶楼夜色

1537
01:10:46,092 --> 01:10:50,125
...on the glamorous roof of the Ritz Gotham.

1538
01:11:00,573 --> 01:11:04,677
成了杂志的封面人物有何感想

1539
01:11:00,573 --> 01:11:04,677
What's it like to have your face on the cover of every magazine?

1540
01:11:06,013 --> 01:11:09,816
身为本市最有身价的单身汉

1541
01:11:06,013 --> 01:11:09,816
Edward, how does it feel to be the city's newest,

1542
01:11:09,816 --> 01:11:11,918
你感觉如何？

1543
01:11:09,816 --> 01:11:11,918
most eligible bachelor?

1544
01:11:11,918 --> 01:11:14,421
想必十分新鲜

1545
01:11:11,918 --> 01:11:14,421
Gotham must know!

1546
01:11:14,421 --> 01:11:16,890
布鲁斯韦恩来了

1547
01:11:14,421 --> 01:11:16,890
There's Bruce Wayne!

1548
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:18,657
老布！

1549
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:18,657
Brucie!

1550
01:11:19,159 --> 01:11:21,899
天啊！他太帅了

1551
01:11:19,159 --> 01:11:21,899
Oh, Eddie, he is too cute!

1552
01:11:22,896 --> 01:11:25,300
你怎么没他那么帅

1553
01:11:22,896 --> 01:11:25,300
How come you don't look so good in that suit?

1554
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:28,268
闭嘴，你有任务在身

1555
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:28,268
Shut up. You're here to work!

1556
01:11:28,268 --> 01:11:29,436
我的痣怎么样

1557
01:11:28,268 --> 01:11:29,436
How's my mole?

1558
01:11:29,436 --> 01:11:30,337
很好

1559
01:11:29,436 --> 01:11:30,337
Fine.

1560
01:11:30,338 --> 01:11:34,107
谣传艾德华有意收购韦恩集团

1561
01:11:30,338 --> 01:11:34,107
What about rumors of a Nygma Tech takeover of Wayne Enterprises?

1562
01:11:34,107 --> 01:11:37,378
尼格玛股票是韦恩集团的两倍

1563
01:11:34,107 --> 01:11:37,378
Nygma Tech stock is outselling Wayne Enterprises 2 to 1 .

1564
01:11:37,378 --> 01:11:40,083
布鲁斯，你的公司过气了吗？

1565
01:11:37,378 --> 01:11:40,083
Are you yesterday's news, Bruce?

1566
01:11:41,549 --> 01:11:43,518
布鲁斯老公公

1567
01:11:41,549 --> 01:11:43,518
Bruce, old man.

1568
01:11:43,518 --> 01:11:46,754
新闻界想知道被形容成

1569
01:11:43,518 --> 01:11:46,754
The press wonders what it's like to be outsold, outclassed, out-coiffed and...

1570
01:11:46,754 --> 01:11:51,831
落伍、过气、明日黄花的感觉

1571
01:11:46,754 --> 01:11:51,831
...generally outdone in every way.

1572
01:11:52,595 --> 01:11:54,997
艾德华，恭喜了

1573
01:11:52,595 --> 01:11:54,997
Hello, Edward. Congratulations.

1574
01:11:54,997 --> 01:11:58,234
派对真热闹，好看的西装

1575
01:11:54,997 --> 01:11:58,234
Great party. Nice suit.

1576
01:11:58,234 --> 01:11:59,763
会讲话

1577
01:11:58,234 --> 01:11:59,763
Wit. Good.

1578
01:12:00,169 --> 01:12:01,637
阁下是？

1579
01:12:00,169 --> 01:12:01,637
And you are?

1580
01:12:01,637 --> 01:12:03,511
梅慈丝

1581
01:12:01,637 --> 01:12:03,511
Chase.

1582
01:12:04,406 --> 01:12:06,767
你一定很难追求

1583
01:12:04,406 --> 01:12:06,767
And what a grand pursuit you must be.

1584
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,482
我是布鲁斯韦恩，小姐是？

1585
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,482
l'm Bruce Wayne, Miss...?

1586
01:12:13,482 --> 01:12:16,151
叫我什么都可以

1587
01:12:13,482 --> 01:12:16,151
You can call me anything you want.

1588
01:12:17,754 --> 01:12:21,525
各位，这是我们的大未来

1589
01:12:17,754 --> 01:12:21,525
Ladies and gentlemen... ...the future!

1590
01:12:21,525 --> 01:12:22,893
第二代魔幻宝盒

1591
01:12:21,525 --> 01:12:22,893
My New lmproved Box offers

1592
01:12:22,893 --> 01:12:26,747
让各位量身打造你们的幻想

1593
01:12:22,893 --> 01:12:26,747
fully-interactive holographic fantasies.

1594
01:12:46,484 --> 01:12:50,221
艾德华，你真是个天才

1595
01:12:46,484 --> 01:12:50,221
Edward, you're dashing and a genius.

1596
01:12:50,221 --> 01:12:53,068
你怎么做到的？

1597
01:12:50,221 --> 01:12:53,068
How do you create these images, hon?

1598
01:12:53,257 --> 01:12:56,768
这是我的小秘密，不告诉你

1599
01:12:53,257 --> 01:12:56,768
That, my dear, is my little secret.

1600
01:13:03,435 --> 01:13:05,637
量身打造幻想

1601
01:13:03,435 --> 01:13:05,637
Fully-interactive holographs.

1602
01:13:05,637 --> 01:13:09,074
用高频率载波发射入大脑

1603
01:13:05,637 --> 01:13:09,074
Only a high-frequency carrier wave, beamed into the brain...

1604
01:13:09,074 --> 01:13:11,143
如此而已

1605
01:13:09,074 --> 01:13:11,143
...could create such images.

1606
01:13:11,143 --> 01:13:15,447
你后悔了吧，输了就要服气

1607
01:13:11,143 --> 01:13:15,447
And you wish you thought of it. Don't be a sore loser.

1608
01:13:15,447 --> 01:13:18,223
进去呀，试试嘛

1609
01:13:15,447 --> 01:13:18,223
Step inside. Give it a try.

1610
01:13:20,086 --> 01:13:23,388
若你能制造出脑中幻象

1611
01:13:20,086 --> 01:13:23,388
lf you can introduce images into the mind, what stops you from...

1612
01:13:23,388 --> 01:13:28,128
那探知他人思想也是轻而易举

1613
01:13:23,388 --> 01:13:28,128
...extracting images out of the mind?

1614
01:13:28,128 --> 01:13:31,876
不敢去试，就直说吧！

1615
01:13:28,128 --> 01:13:31,876
Too timid to try my machine? Just say so.

1616
01:13:34,401 --> 01:13:37,105
可以请你跳支舞吗？

1617
01:13:34,401 --> 01:13:37,105
Shall we dance?

1618
01:13:57,158 --> 01:14:00,983
小坏蛋，你在找什么

1619
01:13:57,158 --> 01:14:00,983
Naughty, naughty. Looking for something?

1620
01:14:01,328 --> 01:14:05,291
我很好奇怎么把机器关掉

1621
01:14:01,328 --> 01:14:05,291
l was just wondering how you turn it off.

1622
01:14:07,639 --> 01:14:08,778
好

1623
01:14:07,639 --> 01:14:08,778
Clever.

1624
01:14:09,805 --> 01:14:10,836
谢谢

1625
01:14:09,805 --> 01:14:10,836
Thanks.

1626
01:14:10,839 --> 01:14:12,227
不客气

1627
01:14:10,839 --> 01:14:12,227
My pleasure.

1628
01:14:41,704 --> 01:14:44,242
晚安，韦恩先生

1629
01:14:41,704 --> 01:14:44,242
Good evening, Mr. Wayne.

1630
01:14:45,242 --> 01:14:52,103
放轻松，告诉我你的梦境

1631
01:14:45,242 --> 01:14:52,103
Relax. Tell me your... ...dreams.

1632
01:14:54,051 --> 01:14:58,013
告诉我你的幻想

1633
01:14:54,051 --> 01:14:58,013
Tell me... ...your fantasies.

1634
01:14:58,756 --> 01:15:03,311
告诉我你心底的秘密

1635
01:14:58,756 --> 01:15:03,311
Tell me your secrets.

1636
01:15:03,327 --> 01:15:09,163
告诉我你内心深藏的

1637
01:15:03,327 --> 01:15:09,163
Tell me... ...your deepest... ...darkest...

1638
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:10,996
恐惧

1639
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:10,996
...fears.

1640
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:43,569
大家不要紧张

1641
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:43,569
Relax, folks!

1642
01:15:43,569 --> 01:15:46,473
这是很简单落后的抢劫

1643
01:15:43,569 --> 01:15:46,473
lt's only an old-fashioned low-tech stick-up!

1644
01:15:46,473 --> 01:15:49,142
我们对太复杂的东西没兴趣

1645
01:15:46,473 --> 01:15:49,142
We're interested in the basics!

1646
01:15:49,142 --> 01:15:52,246
现金、珠宝、大哥大都交出来

1647
01:15:49,142 --> 01:15:52,246
Cash, jewelry, cellular telephones.

1648
01:15:52,246 --> 01:15:55,507
乖乖交出来，大家都会没事

1649
01:15:52,246 --> 01:15:55,507
Hand them over nice and quietly, and no one will be hurt!

1650
01:16:00,854 --> 01:16:02,728
出事了，阿福

1651
01:16:00,854 --> 01:16:02,728
Emergency, Alfred.

1652
01:16:03,157 --> 01:16:04,615
知道了，主人

1653
01:16:03,157 --> 01:16:04,615
Yes, sir.

1654
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:09,784
大家冷静，别慌

1655
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:09,784
Be calm, everybody! Just stay calm!

1656
01:16:09,894 --> 01:16:11,447
很抱歉!

1657
01:16:09,894 --> 01:16:11,447
Excuse me!

1658
01:16:14,702 --> 01:16:18,606
你把我派对弄砸了，你有病吗

1659
01:16:14,702 --> 01:16:18,606
You're ruining my big party! Are you insane?!

1660
01:16:18,606 --> 01:16:21,342
我们等你抓蝙蝠侠快不耐烦了

1661
01:16:18,606 --> 01:16:21,342
We're sick of waiting for you to deliver Batman.

1662
01:16:21,342 --> 01:16:23,344
要有耐心，大哥

1663
01:16:21,342 --> 01:16:23,344
Patience, O Bifurcated One.

1664
01:16:23,344 --> 01:16:25,447
去他的耐心，我们要他死

1665
01:16:23,344 --> 01:16:25,447
Patience, hell, we want him dead!

1666
01:16:25,447 --> 01:16:28,049
要蝙蝠侠出现最简单的方法

1667
01:16:25,447 --> 01:16:28,049
And nothing brings out the Batman

1668
01:16:28,049 --> 01:16:29,751
就是杀几个人

1669
01:16:28,049 --> 01:16:29,751
like a little murder and mayhem!

1670
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:31,620
你该问问我的意见

1671
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:31,620
You could have let me in on the caper.

1672
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:34,322
我们可以好好计划一下

1673
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:34,322
We could have organized it,

1674
01:16:34,322 --> 01:16:37,204
搞不好还可以卖个电影版权

1675
01:16:34,322 --> 01:16:37,204
planned it pre-sold the movie rights!

1676
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:51,474
你的出场方式还不赖

1677
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:51,474
Your entrance was good,

1678
01:16:51,474 --> 01:16:52,754
不过他的更好

1679
01:16:51,474 --> 01:16:52,754
his was better.

1680
01:17:00,851 --> 01:17:02,219
差别何在？

1681
01:17:00,851 --> 01:17:02,219
The difference?

1682
01:17:02,219 --> 01:17:04,271
他秀酷，你秀斗

1683
01:17:02,219 --> 01:17:04,271
Showmanship!

1684
01:17:10,994 --> 01:17:12,488
有麻烦了，阿福

1685
01:17:10,994 --> 01:17:12,488
Emergency, Alfred.

1686
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:14,357
是的 先生

1687
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:14,357
Oh, sir....

1688
01:17:14,598 --> 01:17:17,587
我看我大概会被炒鱿鱼

1689
01:17:14,598 --> 01:17:17,587
l could be fired for this.

1690
01:17:17,769 --> 01:17:19,750
准备回家吃老米饭了

1691
01:17:17,769 --> 01:17:19,750
l'll go back to Buckingham Palace.

1692
01:17:32,417 --> 01:17:34,705
好了，进行第二阶段

1693
01:17:32,417 --> 01:17:34,705
All right, boys! Phase Two!

1694
01:17:38,923 --> 01:17:40,999
午夜，我家见

1695
01:17:38,923 --> 01:17:40,999
My place, midnight.

1696
01:18:44,725 --> 01:18:45,900
瓦斯危险

1697
01:18:52,868 --> 01:18:54,920
完美的杀人工具

1698
01:18:52,868 --> 01:18:54,920
Nothing like a bad case of gas!

1699
01:19:27,937 --> 01:19:30,369
你为什么老是死不了

1700
01:19:27,937 --> 01:19:30,369
Why can't you just die?!

1701
01:20:22,745 --> 01:20:23,919
Hi.

1702
01:20:24,497 --> 01:20:25,778
老兄

1703
01:20:30,803 --> 01:20:32,535
你在干嘛？

1704
01:20:30,803 --> 01:20:32,535
What were you doing?!

1705
01:20:32,538 --> 01:20:35,442
你怎么这么不知好歹？

1706
01:20:32,538 --> 01:20:35,442
You got a real gratitude problem, you know that?

1707
01:20:35,442 --> 01:20:36,777
给我个名字

1708
01:20:35,442 --> 01:20:36,777
l need a name.

1709
01:20:36,777 --> 01:20:38,879
蝙蝠男孩？夜间游侠？

1710
01:20:36,777 --> 01:20:38,879
Batboy? Knight Wing?

1711
01:20:38,879 --> 01:20:40,981
有没有酷一点的名号？

1712
01:20:38,879 --> 01:20:40,981
What's a good sidekick name?

1713
01:20:40,981 --> 01:20:43,484
大学生，狄克葛瑞森

1714
01:20:40,981 --> 01:20:43,484
''Dick Grayson, college student.''

1715
01:20:43,484 --> 01:20:46,387
去你的，我救你一命，你欠我

1716
01:20:43,484 --> 01:20:46,387
Screw you! l saved your life. You owe me.

1717
01:20:46,387 --> 01:20:49,123
你这样下去总有一天会送命

1718
01:20:46,387 --> 01:20:49,123
You're going to get yourself killed.

1719
01:20:49,123 --> 01:20:50,792
我是你的新拍档

1720
01:20:49,123 --> 01:20:50,792
l'm your new partner.

1721
01:20:50,792 --> 01:20:51,759
不行

1722
01:20:50,792 --> 01:20:51,759
No!

1723
01:20:51,759 --> 01:20:53,727
你去哪儿我都盯着你

1724
01:20:51,759 --> 01:20:53,727
Whenever you go out at night, l'll be watching.

1725
01:20:53,727 --> 01:20:56,631
蝙蝠侠去哪儿，我也跟着去

1726
01:20:53,727 --> 01:20:56,631
Where Batman goes, l'll go.

1727
01:20:56,631 --> 01:20:59,300
你如何阻止我

1728
01:20:56,631 --> 01:20:59,300
How will you stop me?

1729
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,067
我会阻止你的

1730
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,067
l can stop you.

1731
01:21:05,574 --> 01:21:09,148
把这个挂在蝙蝠装旁边

1732
01:21:05,574 --> 01:21:09,148
Hang this next to the Batsuit... ...where it belongs.

1733
01:21:13,648 --> 01:21:16,281
你在暗中鼓励他

1734
01:21:13,648 --> 01:21:16,281
You're encouraging him.

1735
01:21:16,952 --> 01:21:19,054
充满复仇怒火的年轻人

1736
01:21:16,952 --> 01:21:19,054
Young men with a mind for revenge

1737
01:21:19,054 --> 01:21:20,789
需要一点鼓励

1738
01:21:19,054 --> 01:21:20,789
need little encouragement.

1739
01:21:20,789 --> 01:21:22,698
他们需要的是引导

1740
01:21:20,789 --> 01:21:22,698
They need guidance.

1741
01:21:24,093 --> 01:21:28,921
你该清楚这一路你怎么走过来

1742
01:21:24,093 --> 01:21:28,921
You, above all, should know the consequences of the life you choose.

1743
01:21:36,106 --> 01:21:39,742
连慈丝都说蝙蝠侠是受了诅咒

1744
01:21:36,106 --> 01:21:39,742
Even Chase calls being Batman a curse.

1745
01:21:39,742 --> 01:21:42,316
也许她和你会来电

1746
01:21:39,742 --> 01:21:42,316
Perhaps the lady's just what the doctor ordered.

1747
01:21:42,378 --> 01:21:44,395
她才貌兼备

1748
01:21:42,378 --> 01:21:44,395
She seems lovely and wise.

1749
01:21:45,548 --> 01:21:47,837
我从未恋爱过

1750
01:21:45,548 --> 01:21:47,837
l've never been in love before.

1751
01:21:48,418 --> 01:21:53,067
去找她，向她表白

1752
01:21:48,418 --> 01:21:53,067
Go to her. Tell her how you feel.

1753
01:21:53,357 --> 01:21:56,260
她喜欢蝙蝠侠，不是我布鲁斯

1754
01:21:53,357 --> 01:21:56,260
She wants Batman, not Bruce Wayne.

1755
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:58,857
何不让她来决定

1756
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:58,857
Let her decide.

1757
01:22:52,019 --> 01:22:57,273
抱歉，真令人难以相信

1758
01:22:52,019 --> 01:22:57,273
l'm sorry. l can't believe this.

1759
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:01,795
从我第一次见你就期待此刻

1760
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:01,795
l've imagined this moment since l first saw you.

1761
01:23:01,795 --> 01:23:09,055
你的眼，你的唇，你的身体

1762
01:23:01,795 --> 01:23:09,055
Your eyes... ...your lips. Your body.

1763
01:23:10,605 --> 01:23:14,175
现在你近在眼前

1764
01:23:10,605 --> 01:23:14,175
And now l have you and...

1765
01:23:14,175 --> 01:23:18,552
而我却想着另一个人

1766
01:23:14,175 --> 01:23:18,552
...l'm wishing you were somebody else.

1767
01:23:22,216 --> 01:23:25,028
我想我该长大了

1768
01:23:22,216 --> 01:23:25,028
l guess a girl has to grow up sometime.

1769
01:23:27,021 --> 01:23:35,928
我爱上了一个人，不是你

1770
01:23:27,021 --> 01:23:35,928
l've met someone. He's not you.

1771
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:41,661
希望你能谅解

1772
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:41,661
l hope you can understand.

1773
01:23:45,741 --> 01:23:47,959
我完全了解

1774
01:23:45,741 --> 01:23:47,959
l understand.

1775
01:23:52,286 --> 01:23:53,531
好吧

1776
01:23:52,286 --> 01:23:53,531
Well....

1777
01:24:06,796 --> 01:24:09,299
蝙蝠侠地道死里逃生

1778
01:24:15,805 --> 01:24:17,917
我跟你一样难过

1779
01:24:15,805 --> 01:24:17,917
That's just what l said.

1780
01:24:18,708 --> 01:24:20,962
有个点子让我们乐一乐

1781
01:24:18,708 --> 01:24:20,962
Then l taught my doggie a new trick:

1782
01:24:21,811 --> 01:24:23,270
如何透视人心

1783
01:24:21,811 --> 01:24:23,270
how to map the human mind.

1784
01:24:23,948 --> 01:24:26,083
想瞧瞧布鲁斯韦恩在想什么吗

1785
01:24:23,948 --> 01:24:26,083
Would you like to see what Bruce Wayne has in his head?

1786
01:24:26,083 --> 01:24:28,895
尼氏科技档案，扫瞄韦恩档案

1787
01:24:41,533 --> 01:24:42,778
猜猜看

1788
01:24:41,533 --> 01:24:42,778
Riddle me this:

1789
01:24:43,969 --> 01:24:48,371
什么样的人脑中想着蝙蝠？

1790
01:24:43,969 --> 01:24:48,371
What kind of man... ...has bats on the brain?

1791
01:24:51,877 --> 01:24:53,879
说吧，你来说

1792
01:24:51,877 --> 01:24:53,879
-Go ahead. You can say it.

1793
01:24:53,879 --> 01:24:55,433
你是个天才

1794
01:24:53,879 --> 01:24:55,433
-You're a genius.

1795
01:24:55,481 --> 01:24:56,939
奥，我受不了

1796
01:24:55,481 --> 01:24:56,939
Oh, stop.

1797
01:25:00,219 --> 01:25:04,181
从今天起，蝙蝠侠永远消失了

1798
01:25:00,219 --> 01:25:04,181
So, from this day on... ...Batman is no more.

1799
01:25:06,526 --> 01:25:07,827
你不能撒手不管

1800
01:25:06,526 --> 01:25:07,827
You can't just quit.

1801
01:25:07,827 --> 01:25:09,072
邪恶份子仍在猖狂

1802
01:25:07,827 --> 01:25:09,072
There's monsters out there.

1803
01:25:09,095 --> 01:25:11,112
蝙蝠侠有责任济弱扶倾

1804
01:25:09,095 --> 01:25:11,112
Batman has to protect the innocent.

1805
01:25:11,564 --> 01:25:13,533
我已花了一辈子的时间

1806
01:25:11,564 --> 01:25:13,533
l've dedicated my life to helping strangers l've never met.

1807
01:25:13,533 --> 01:25:17,612
去帮助素昧平生的人

1808
01:25:13,533 --> 01:25:17,612
Faces l've never seen.

1809
01:25:17,838 --> 01:25:19,048
好

1810
01:25:17,838 --> 01:25:19,048
Well...

1811
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:21,378
我做得太多了

1812
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:21,378
...the innocent aren't faceless anymore.

1813
01:25:22,942 --> 01:25:25,683
你无权要我照你意思过生活

1814
01:25:22,942 --> 01:25:25,683
You can't tell me what to do with the rest of my life.

1815
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:29,249
我老爸说人有权决定生活目标

1816
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:29,249
My dad told me that every man goes his own way.

1817
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:31,719
我的生活目标就是双面人

1818
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:31,719
My way goes to Two-Face.

1819
01:25:31,719 --> 01:25:33,937
你一定要帮我

1820
01:25:31,719 --> 01:25:33,937
You must help me.

1821
01:25:34,188 --> 01:25:37,491
你就算找到双面人杀了他

1822
01:25:34,188 --> 01:25:37,491
And if you do find Harvey... ...and then kill him...

1823
01:25:37,491 --> 01:25:39,223
然后呢？

1824
01:25:37,491 --> 01:25:39,223
...what next?

1825
01:25:42,863 --> 01:25:44,393
完全正确

1826
01:25:42,863 --> 01:25:44,393
Exactly.

1827
01:25:44,933 --> 01:25:48,408
然后就像我一样孤独

1828
01:25:44,933 --> 01:25:48,408
Then you'd be alone, like me.

1829
01:25:50,038 --> 01:25:52,743
忘了这些无谓的仇恨吧

1830
01:25:50,038 --> 01:25:52,743
No, you must let this go.

1831
01:25:52,774 --> 01:25:54,576
听我的话，我是你朋友

1832
01:25:52,774 --> 01:25:54,576
Listen to me, l'm your friend.

1833
01:25:54,576 --> 01:25:57,245
我不需要朋友，我要一个拍档

1834
01:25:54,576 --> 01:25:57,245
l don't need a friend, l need a partner.

1835
01:25:57,245 --> 01:26:00,282
双面人要付出代价

1836
01:25:57,245 --> 01:26:00,282
Two-Face has got to pay.

1837
01:26:00,282 --> 01:26:01,942
求求你

1838
01:26:00,282 --> 01:26:01,942
Please.

1839
01:26:03,552 --> 01:26:05,921
慈丝来吃晚饭

1840
01:26:03,552 --> 01:26:05,921
Chase is coming for dinner. l'm going to tell her...

1841
01:26:05,921 --> 01:26:09,196
我会把一切都告诉她

1842
01:26:05,921 --> 01:26:09,196
...everything.

1843
01:26:11,494 --> 01:26:13,368
上去吧，我们再谈

1844
01:26:11,494 --> 01:26:13,368
Come upstairs. We'll talk.

1845
01:26:28,879 --> 01:26:30,089
晚安

1846
01:26:28,879 --> 01:26:30,089
-Good evening.

1847
01:26:30,213 --> 01:26:31,387
晚安

1848
01:26:30,213 --> 01:26:31,387
-Good evening.

1849
01:26:31,615 --> 01:26:33,169
万圣节快乐

1850
01:26:31,615 --> 01:26:33,169
Happy Halloween.

1851
01:26:33,183 --> 01:26:34,571
万圣节快乐

1852
01:26:33,183 --> 01:26:34,571
Happy Halloween to you.

1853
01:27:09,788 --> 01:27:11,423
我今晚请你来

1854
01:27:09,788 --> 01:27:11,423
l asked you here tonight because

1855
01:27:11,423 --> 01:27:14,726
是有些事想告诉你

1856
01:27:11,423 --> 01:27:14,726
there's something l wanted to tell you.

1857
01:27:14,726 --> 01:27:17,497
我也有些话想跟你讲

1858
01:27:14,726 --> 01:27:17,497
l wanted to tell you something too.

1859
01:27:17,497 --> 01:27:19,441
是这样的...

1860
01:27:17,497 --> 01:27:19,441
What l wanted--

1861
01:27:20,166 --> 01:27:22,277
没关系，你先讲

1862
01:27:20,166 --> 01:27:22,277
Go ahead, you first.

1863
01:27:26,239 --> 01:27:28,943
给我糖，否则就捣蛋

1864
01:27:26,239 --> 01:27:28,943
Trick or treat!

1865
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:35,516
我以前一直迷某种类型的男人

1866
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:35,516
All my life l have been... ...attracted to a certain kind of man.

1867
01:27:35,516 --> 01:27:37,078
那种痞子型的

1868
01:27:35,516 --> 01:27:37,078
The wrong kind.

1869
01:27:37,078 --> 01:27:42,279
甚至还靠研究这种人为生

1870
01:27:37,078 --> 01:27:42,279
And look what l do for a living.

1871
01:27:43,056 --> 01:27:48,264
自从...自从我认识你以后...我

1872
01:27:43,056 --> 01:27:48,264
And since... ...since l met you, l...

1873
01:27:49,296 --> 01:27:52,879
天啊，我怎么语无伦次

1874
01:27:49,296 --> 01:27:52,879
Oh, God. Why am l so nervous?

1875
01:28:00,508 --> 01:28:03,711
别吃太多糖，小心吃坏肚子

1876
01:28:00,508 --> 01:28:03,711
Don't eat too much tonight or you'll be sick in your beds.

1877
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:05,728
万圣节快乐

1878
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:05,728
Happy Halloween!

1879
01:28:51,328 --> 01:28:52,644
怎么了？

1880
01:28:51,328 --> 01:28:52,644
What's wrong?

1881
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:56,711
又来了，那些影像

1882
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:56,711
lt's happening again. Flashes.

1883
01:28:57,634 --> 01:28:59,402
我父母的死

1884
01:28:57,634 --> 01:28:59,402
My parents' death.

1885
01:29:00,070 --> 01:29:02,181
你的记忆又再度浮现

1886
01:29:00,070 --> 01:29:02,181
Your memories are trying to surface.

1887
01:29:02,674 --> 01:29:04,618
我要告诉你一件事

1888
01:29:02,674 --> 01:29:04,618
l want to tell you something.

1889
01:29:04,809 --> 01:29:06,945
我没有和任何人说过

1890
01:29:04,809 --> 01:29:06,945
Something l've never told anyone.

1891
01:29:06,945 --> 01:29:09,861
没关系，我在你身边

1892
01:29:06,945 --> 01:29:09,861
lt's all right. lt's all right. l'm here.

1893
01:29:16,689 --> 01:29:18,456
我就在这儿

1894
01:29:16,689 --> 01:29:18,456
l'm here.

1895
01:29:22,628 --> 01:29:24,775
就在替我父母守灵之夜

1896
01:29:22,628 --> 01:29:24,775
The night of my parents' wake...

1897
01:29:25,097 --> 01:29:28,051
牧师安慰我的话完全没有作用

1898
01:29:25,097 --> 01:29:28,051
...the priest's words gave no comfort.

1899
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:34,136
就在父亲书桌上

1900
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:34,136
Of course. There, on my father's desk...

1901
01:29:34,406 --> 01:29:36,031
有本红色的书

1902
01:29:34,406 --> 01:29:36,031
...the red book.

1903
01:29:36,342 --> 01:29:37,895
那是他的日记

1904
01:29:36,342 --> 01:29:37,895
His journal.

1905
01:29:38,077 --> 01:29:39,666
他每天都写

1906
01:29:38,077 --> 01:29:39,666
He wrote in it every day.

1907
01:29:40,946 --> 01:29:44,659
但从那天起却永远无法继续了

1908
01:29:40,946 --> 01:29:44,659
But now he'd never write in it again.

1909
01:29:44,718 --> 01:29:47,052
在那一刻，我知道

1910
01:29:44,718 --> 01:29:47,052
At that moment l knew...

1911
01:29:47,052 --> 01:29:50,563
我的生命有重大转变

1912
01:29:47,052 --> 01:29:50,563
...my life would never be the same.

1913
01:29:55,161 --> 01:29:57,831
我冲出去，外面狂风暴雨

1914
01:29:55,161 --> 01:29:57,831
l raced out into the storm...

1915
01:29:57,831 --> 01:30:02,370
我想将一切愤怒痛苦抛诸脑后

1916
01:29:57,831 --> 01:30:02,370
...trying to outrun the rage. The pain.

1917
01:30:02,370 --> 01:30:05,039
然后我跌了进去

1918
01:30:02,370 --> 01:30:05,039
Then l fell.

1919
01:30:06,039 --> 01:30:08,091
那是一个很大的洞穴

1920
01:30:06,039 --> 01:30:08,091
l fell forever.

1921
01:30:09,944 --> 01:30:15,025
那个洞仿佛存在了好几百年

1922
01:30:09,944 --> 01:30:15,025
The cave was monstrous. lt must have been there for centuries.

1923
01:30:17,451 --> 01:30:23,723
在深远的暗处我看到了...

1924
01:30:17,451 --> 01:30:23,723
And there... ...deep in the shadows... ...l saw....

1925
01:30:26,294 --> 01:30:29,034
它朝我飞过来

1926
01:30:26,294 --> 01:30:29,034
lt was coming toward me.

1927
01:30:29,231 --> 01:30:33,679
起初我很害怕，但只有一下子

1928
01:30:29,231 --> 01:30:33,679
l was scared at first, but only at first.

1929
01:30:33,702 --> 01:30:37,639
那黑暗中的影像让我立定目标

1930
01:30:33,702 --> 01:30:37,639
The figure in the dark was my destiny.

1931
01:30:37,639 --> 01:30:41,222
它改变了我的一生

1932
01:30:37,639 --> 01:30:41,222
lt would change my life forever.

1933
01:30:41,743 --> 01:30:43,440
我要用这个影像

1934
01:30:41,743 --> 01:30:43,440
l would use its image to strike terror

1935
01:30:43,445 --> 01:30:46,381
作为打击邪恶的正义化身

1936
01:30:43,445 --> 01:30:46,381
into the hearts of those who did evil.

1937
01:30:46,381 --> 01:30:48,083
我发誓绝不让我的悲剧

1938
01:30:46,381 --> 01:30:48,083
l would ensure what happened to me

1939
01:30:48,083 --> 01:30:50,266
在他人身上重演

1940
01:30:48,083 --> 01:30:50,266
would never happen to anyone else.

1941
01:30:52,088 --> 01:30:53,856
我要报仇

1942
01:30:52,088 --> 01:30:53,856
l would have my revenge.

1943
01:30:57,794 --> 01:31:00,367
你想告诉我什么？

1944
01:30:57,794 --> 01:31:00,367
What are you trying to tell me?

1945
01:31:01,297 --> 01:31:03,480
我就是...

1946
01:31:01,297 --> 01:31:03,480
l'm....

1947
01:31:38,169 --> 01:31:41,502
给我糖，否则就捣蛋

1948
01:31:38,169 --> 01:31:41,502
Twick or tweet!

1949
01:31:47,379 --> 01:31:48,909
你上当了！

1950
01:31:47,379 --> 01:31:48,909
Trick.

1951
01:31:55,488 --> 01:31:57,356
记得计划吧？

1952
01:31:55,488 --> 01:31:57,356
Remember the plan?

1953
01:31:57,356 --> 01:31:59,502
抓了人就跑

1954
01:31:57,356 --> 01:31:59,502
Seize and capture.

1955
01:31:59,558 --> 01:32:01,147
留下活口

1956
01:31:59,558 --> 01:32:01,147
No killing.

1957
01:32:01,327 --> 01:32:02,715
千万别忘了

1958
01:32:01,327 --> 01:32:02,715
That goes double for you.

1959
01:32:05,632 --> 01:32:08,468
若我是超级大英雄

1960
01:32:05,632 --> 01:32:08,468
lf l was a superhero...

1961
01:32:08,468 --> 01:32:11,279
该躲在哪儿呢？

1962
01:32:08,468 --> 01:32:11,279
...where would l hide?

1963
01:32:16,075 --> 01:32:18,258
上帝惩罚我吧！

1964
01:32:16,075 --> 01:32:18,258
Spank me.

1965
01:32:29,657 --> 01:32:32,539
非法闯入，注意，非法闯入

1966
01:32:29,657 --> 01:32:32,539
lntruder alert! lntruder alert! lntruder alert!

1967
01:32:35,163 --> 01:32:37,532
非法闯入！注意

1968
01:32:35,163 --> 01:32:37,532
lntruder alert! lntruder alert!

1969
01:32:37,532 --> 01:32:38,955
安静！

1970
01:32:37,532 --> 01:32:38,955
Shut up!

1971
01:32:49,578 --> 01:32:52,009
好戏上场了

1972
01:32:49,578 --> 01:32:52,009
Now, that's impressive!

1973
01:33:07,763 --> 01:33:12,070
把驯养的动物放回丛林很危险

1974
01:33:07,763 --> 01:33:12,070
lt's always risky introducing a tamed animal into the wild.

1975
01:33:25,448 --> 01:33:28,639
它们会很难适应新环境

1976
01:33:25,448 --> 01:33:28,639
They may have trouble adapting to their new environment.

1977
01:34:07,492 --> 01:34:11,372
我这就速战速决

1978
01:34:07,492 --> 01:34:11,372
Somebody tell the fat lady... ...she's on in five.

1979
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:31,796
太痛快了！

1980
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:31,796
Joygasm!

1981
01:34:53,508 --> 01:34:54,753
去抓那女的

1982
01:34:53,508 --> 01:34:54,753
Get the girl!

1983
01:35:06,821 --> 01:35:08,730
别杀他

1984
01:35:06,821 --> 01:35:08,730
Don't kill him.

1985
01:35:10,358 --> 01:35:12,410
若杀他的话...

1986
01:35:10,358 --> 01:35:12,410
lf you kill him...

1987
01:35:17,733 --> 01:35:20,366
我们是哥儿们好，五个宝

1988
01:35:21,170 --> 01:35:23,008
他解不出来的

1989
01:35:21,170 --> 01:35:23,008
...he won't learn nothing.

1990
01:35:57,942 --> 01:35:59,567
布鲁斯先生!

1991
01:35:57,942 --> 01:35:59,567
Master Bruce!

1992
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:09,127
主人，你没事吧，小伙子

1993
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:09,127
How are you, young man?

1994
01:36:10,688 --> 01:36:13,991
你很久没这么叫我了

1995
01:36:10,688 --> 01:36:13,991
You haven't called me that for a long time.

1996
01:36:13,991 --> 01:36:16,495
坏习惯难改

1997
01:36:13,991 --> 01:36:16,495
Old habits die hard.

1998
01:36:16,495 --> 01:36:18,476
你还好吧？

1999
01:36:16,495 --> 01:36:18,476
Are you okay?

2000
01:36:18,764 --> 01:36:20,097
慈丝呢？

2001
01:36:18,764 --> 01:36:20,097
Where's Chase?

2002
01:36:20,097 --> 01:36:22,529
他们把她绑走了

2003
01:36:20,097 --> 01:36:22,529
l'm afraid they've taken her.

2004
01:36:22,667 --> 01:36:25,240
小主人逃跑了

2005
01:36:22,667 --> 01:36:25,240
Master Dick has run away.

2006
01:36:25,303 --> 01:36:28,114
蝙蝠洞被毁了

2007
01:36:25,303 --> 01:36:28,114
The cave has been destroyed.

2008
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:31,316
这是另一个谜语

2009
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:31,316
And there's another riddle.

2010
01:36:41,521 --> 01:36:44,475
我来了，小美人

2011
01:36:41,521 --> 01:36:44,475
l'm coming, my sweet.

2012
01:36:47,627 --> 01:36:49,729
喜欢我的外套吗？

2013
01:36:47,627 --> 01:36:49,729
Like the jacket?

2014
01:36:49,729 --> 01:36:54,177
这让我夜间慢跑也很安全

2015
01:36:49,729 --> 01:36:54,177
lt keeps me safe when l'm... ...jogging at night.

2016
01:36:54,467 --> 01:36:57,270
蝙蝠侠会来救我

2017
01:36:54,467 --> 01:36:57,270
Batman will come for me.

2018
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:59,215
蝙蝠侠？

2019
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:59,215
Batman?

2020
01:36:59,706 --> 01:37:01,782
你是说蝙蝠侠？

2021
01:36:59,706 --> 01:37:01,782
Batman, you say?

2022
01:37:02,609 --> 01:37:04,661
会来救你？

2023
01:37:02,609 --> 01:37:04,661
Coming for you?

2024
01:37:07,714 --> 01:37:11,676
我会恭迎他大驾光临

2025
01:37:07,714 --> 01:37:11,676
l'm... ...counting on it.

2026
01:37:16,223 --> 01:37:19,521
那是什么？从哪儿来的？

2027
01:37:16,223 --> 01:37:19,521
What is that? Where's it coming from?

2028
01:37:19,894 --> 01:37:21,139
那边

2029
01:37:19,894 --> 01:37:21,139
There!

2030
01:37:21,429 --> 01:37:23,597
是谁在搞鬼

2031
01:37:21,429 --> 01:37:23,597
Who's doing that?

2032
01:37:23,597 --> 01:37:25,966
谜天大圣

2033
01:37:23,597 --> 01:37:25,966
The Riddler!

2034
01:37:25,966 --> 01:37:29,193
我们是哥儿们好，五个宝

2035
01:37:25,966 --> 01:37:29,193
''We're five little items of an everyday sort.

2036
01:37:30,538 --> 01:37:34,606
可在a  tennis court中找到

2037
01:37:30,538 --> 01:37:34,606
''You'll find us all in a tennis court.'' ln....

2038
01:37:34,876 --> 01:37:37,579
A，E，I，O，U

2039
01:37:34,876 --> 01:37:37,579
A-E-l-O-U.

2040
01:37:37,579 --> 01:37:38,580
五个母音

2041
01:37:37,579 --> 01:37:38,580
Vowels.

2042
01:37:38,580 --> 01:37:40,525
有点眉目了

2043
01:37:38,580 --> 01:37:40,525
Not entirely unclever, sir.

2044
01:37:41,283 --> 01:37:45,187
时钟、火柴、卒子、母音

2045
01:37:41,283 --> 01:37:45,187
But what do a clock, a match, chess pawns...

2046
01:37:45,187 --> 01:37:47,423
到底有何关联？代表些什么

2047
01:37:45,187 --> 01:37:47,423
...and vowels have in common? What do these riddles mean?

2048
01:37:47,423 --> 01:37:50,059
每个谜语都有数字

2049
01:37:47,423 --> 01:37:50,059
Every riddle contains a number and they arrived in this order:

2050
01:37:50,059 --> 01:37:53,700
13，1，8和5

2051
01:37:50,059 --> 01:37:53,700
...13, 1, 8... ...and 5.

2052
01:37:53,829 --> 01:37:56,899
13，1，8和5

2053
01:37:53,829 --> 01:37:56,899
13, 1, 8 and 5.

2054
01:37:56,899 --> 01:37:57,900
代表什么？

2055
01:37:56,899 --> 01:37:57,900
Meaning?

2056
01:37:57,900 --> 01:37:59,902
字母顺序吗？

2057
01:37:57,900 --> 01:37:59,902
Letters of the alphabet?

2058
01:37:59,902 --> 01:38:02,500
13就是M

2059
01:37:59,902 --> 01:38:02,500
Of course, 13 is M.

2060
01:38:02,605 --> 01:38:05,575
1是A，8是H，5是E

2061
01:38:02,605 --> 01:38:05,575
1 would be A, 8 would be H and 5 would be E.

2062
01:38:05,575 --> 01:38:08,578
MAHE

2063
01:38:05,575 --> 01:38:08,578
MAHE M-A-H-E.

2064
01:38:08,578 --> 01:38:11,948
也许1和8该看成18

2065
01:38:08,578 --> 01:38:11,948
Perhaps 1 and 8 are 18.

2066
01:38:11,948 --> 01:38:14,184
18就是R

2067
01:38:11,948 --> 01:38:14,184
18 is ''R.''

2068
01:38:14,184 --> 01:38:16,473
MRE

2069
01:38:14,184 --> 01:38:16,473
MRE M-R-E.

2070
01:38:18,155 --> 01:38:20,457
是不是Mr.E？

2071
01:38:18,155 --> 01:38:20,457
How about... ...''Mr. E?''

2072
01:38:20,457 --> 01:38:21,458
Mystry？  （谜）

2073
01:38:20,457 --> 01:38:21,458
-Mystery?

2074
01:38:21,458 --> 01:38:22,927
它的同义字是？

2075
01:38:21,458 --> 01:38:22,927
-Another name for mystery?

2076
01:38:22,927 --> 01:38:24,562
Enigma

2077
01:38:22,927 --> 01:38:24,562
Enigma.

2078
01:38:24,562 --> 01:38:26,797
E.尼格玛先生

2079
01:38:24,562 --> 01:38:26,797
Mr. E. Nygma.

2080
01:38:26,797 --> 01:38:28,766
就是艾德华尼格玛

2081
01:38:26,797 --> 01:38:28,766
Edward Nygma.

2082
01:38:28,766 --> 01:38:32,770
史帝雷的自杀显然是电脑合成

2083
01:38:28,766 --> 01:38:32,770
Stickley's suicide was obviously a computer-generated forgery.

2084
01:38:32,770 --> 01:38:35,166
你脑筋还不赖嘛

2085
01:38:32,770 --> 01:38:35,166
You really are quite bright, despite what people say.

2086
01:38:37,108 --> 01:38:39,377
所有蝙蝠装都毁了吗？

2087
01:38:37,108 --> 01:38:39,377
Are all the Batsuits destroyed?

2088
01:38:39,377 --> 01:38:43,576
只剩一件原型，你还未试穿过

2089
01:38:39,377 --> 01:38:43,576
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications. But it's not tested.

2090
01:38:44,749 --> 01:38:46,517
那就拿来试试吧

2091
01:38:44,749 --> 01:38:46,517
Tonight's a good night.

2092
01:38:58,564 --> 01:39:02,170
你看我该由海上突击

2093
01:38:58,564 --> 01:39:02,170
What do you suggest? By sea...

2094
01:39:02,502 --> 01:39:04,162
还是空中轰炸

2095
01:39:02,502 --> 01:39:04,162
...or by air?

2096
01:39:09,308 --> 01:39:11,491
何不同时进行

2097
01:39:09,308 --> 01:39:11,491
Why not both.

2098
01:39:19,185 --> 01:39:21,155
你的造型是谁弄的？

2099
01:39:19,185 --> 01:39:21,155
Who's your tailor?

2100
01:39:21,155 --> 01:39:22,779
是我

2101
01:39:21,155 --> 01:39:22,779
l took the liberty, sir.

2102
01:39:25,858 --> 01:39:28,705
R？代表什么

2103
01:39:25,858 --> 01:39:28,705
R? What's that stand for?

2104
01:39:30,497 --> 01:39:31,921
罗宾

2105
01:39:30,497 --> 01:39:31,921
Robin.

2106
01:39:33,133 --> 01:39:34,722
双面人和谜天大圣联手

2107
01:39:33,133 --> 01:39:34,722
Riddler and Two-Face can make

2108
01:39:34,735 --> 01:39:36,670
是可怕的组合

2109
01:39:34,735 --> 01:39:36,670
a pretty lethal combination.

2110
01:39:36,670 --> 01:39:38,105
你需要帮手

2111
01:39:36,670 --> 01:39:38,105
You can use a hand.

2112
01:39:38,105 --> 01:39:40,474
二对二，胜算会大一点

2113
01:39:38,105 --> 01:39:40,474
Two against two are better odds.

2114
01:39:40,474 --> 01:39:43,179
我不保证我不会杀双面人

2115
01:39:40,474 --> 01:39:43,179
l can't promise l won't kill Harvey.

2116
01:39:43,545 --> 01:39:46,214
人有权决定他的生活目标

2117
01:39:43,545 --> 01:39:46,214
A man's got to go his own way.

2118
01:39:46,214 --> 01:39:48,467
有个朋友是这么告诉我

2119
01:39:46,214 --> 01:39:48,467
A friend taught me that.

2120
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:54,065
不止是朋友，是最佳拍档

2121
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:54,065
Not just a friend. A partner.

2122
01:40:27,491 --> 01:40:31,277
他不会来了，关掉吧

2123
01:40:27,491 --> 01:40:31,277
He's not coming. Shut it down.

2124
01:40:41,271 --> 01:40:42,825
等一下

2125
01:40:41,271 --> 01:40:42,825
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

2126
01:40:55,753 --> 01:40:56,963
加油！

2127
01:40:55,753 --> 01:40:56,963
Hey, go!

2128
01:41:22,548 --> 01:41:24,280

01:41:29,289 --> 01:41:30,190
Hit!

2132
01:41:30,190 --> 01:41:31,391
漂亮！

2133
01:41:30,190 --> 01:41:31,391

2137
01:41:37,097 --> 01:41:38,064
Hit!

2138
01:41:38,064 --> 01:41:40,176
B12是我最爱的维他命

2139
01:41:38,064 --> 01:41:40,176
My favorite vitamin.

2140
01:41:50,176 --> 01:41:52,213
我有胜利的预感

2141
01:41:50,176 --> 01:41:52,213
That sinking feeling.

2142
01:41:52,213 --> 01:41:53,565
太好玩了

2143
01:41:52,213 --> 01:41:53,565
l like this game.

2144
01:41:53,781 --> 01:41:55,097
座标C-9

01:41:53,781 --> 01:41:55,097
C-9!

2146
01:42:05,693 --> 01:42:08,764
你把我战舰炸沉了

2147
01:42:05,693 --> 01:42:08,764
You sunk my battleship!

2148
01:42:08,764 --> 01:42:10,293
谁？我吗？

2149
01:42:08,764 --> 01:42:10,293
Who, me?

2150
01:42:34,524 --> 01:42:37,460
舰长报告，请大家回座坐好

2151
01:42:34,524 --> 01:42:37,460
This is your captain speaking.Please return to your seats.

2152
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:40,580
即将面临乱流

2153
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:40,580
We will be experiencing turbulence.

2154
01:42:48,204 --> 01:42:49,592
打中了！

2155
01:42:48,204 --> 01:42:49,592
l got him!

2156
01:42:56,346 --> 01:42:58,706
希望还找得到黑盒子

2157
01:42:56,346 --> 01:42:58,706
l hope they can find the little black box.

2158
01:43:44,072 --> 01:43:50,744
接下来，好戏正式上场

2159
01:43:44,072 --> 01:43:50,744
Now... ...the real game begins.

2160
01:43:57,477 --> 01:44:00,431
蝙蝠侠，这都是生锈的金属

2161
01:43:57,477 --> 01:44:00,431
Holy rusted metal, Batman!

2162
01:44:01,081 --> 01:44:02,778
地面全是金属

2163
01:44:01,081 --> 01:44:02,778
The ground, it's all metal.

2164
01:44:03,083 --> 01:44:05,681
到处都是坑洞，天啊

2165
01:44:03,083 --> 01:44:05,681
lt's full of holes. Holy.

2166
01:44:10,457 --> 01:44:15,644
等等，整个岛都在移动

2167
01:44:10,457 --> 01:44:15,644
Wait! The whole island's moving!

2168
01:45:02,679 --> 01:45:04,269
在找我们吗？

2169
01:45:02,679 --> 01:45:04,269
Looking for us?

2170
01:45:08,184 --> 01:45:10,260
这一脚是为我老妈踢的

2171
01:45:08,184 --> 01:45:10,260
For my mother!

2172
01:45:10,587 --> 01:45:11,726
我老爸的

2173
01:45:10,587 --> 01:45:11,726
My father!

2174
01:45:14,324 --> 01:45:15,569
我老哥的

2175
01:45:14,324 --> 01:45:15,569
My brother!

2176
01:45:16,927 --> 01:45:18,730
这一下是为我自己

2177
01:45:16,927 --> 01:45:18,730
And this is for me!

2178
01:45:50,363 --> 01:45:53,103
正义终究得以伸张

2179
01:45:50,363 --> 01:45:53,103
Finally, justice is served!

2180
01:45:53,766 --> 01:45:55,604
让我们死吧

2181
01:45:53,766 --> 01:45:55,604
Let us die!

2182
01:46:03,743 --> 01:46:06,589
你比我们也好不到哪儿去

2183
01:46:03,743 --> 01:46:06,589
You're a man after our own heart, son!

2184
01:46:07,046 --> 01:46:08,635
地狱见了

2185
01:46:07,046 --> 01:46:08,635
l'll see you in hell!

2186
01:46:14,688 --> 01:46:17,155
算了，你去坐牢吧

2187
01:46:14,688 --> 01:46:17,155
l'd rather see you in jail!

2188
01:46:21,395 --> 01:46:25,298
好孩子，蝙蝠侠教得好

2189
01:46:21,395 --> 01:46:25,298
Oh, good boy. Good boy. The Bat's taught you well.

2190
01:46:25,298 --> 01:46:26,633
伟大

2191
01:46:25,298 --> 01:46:26,633
Noble.

2192
01:46:26,633 --> 01:46:29,994
愚蠢，不过很伟大

2193
01:46:26,633 --> 01:46:29,994
Stupid... ...but noble.

2194
01:47:14,650 --> 01:47:18,353
大家一起猜一猜

2195
01:47:14,650 --> 01:47:18,353
Riddle me this. Riddle me that.

2196
01:47:18,722 --> 01:47:21,189
谁怕那只大蝙蝠

2197
01:47:18,722 --> 01:47:21,189
Who's afraid of the big black bat?

2198
01:47:22,258 --> 01:47:24,627
别玩花样了，艾德华

2199
01:47:22,258 --> 01:47:24,627
No more tricks, Edward.

2200
01:47:24,627 --> 01:47:26,500
很好，既然如此

2201
01:47:24,627 --> 01:47:26,500
Very well, then.

2202
01:47:30,667 --> 01:47:32,399
我们来办正事

2203
01:47:30,667 --> 01:47:32,399
Let's get real.

2204
01:47:32,869 --> 01:47:35,505
放了她，这是你我的私人恩怨

2205
01:47:32,869 --> 01:47:35,505
Release Chase. This is between us.

2206
01:47:35,505 --> 01:47:38,983
还有我 还有我

2207
01:47:35,505 --> 01:47:38,983
And me... ...and me!

2208
01:47:40,877 --> 01:47:42,646
你已吸收全市脑波

2209
01:47:40,877 --> 01:47:42,646
You've sucked Gotham's brain waves and

2210
01:47:42,646 --> 01:47:45,907
现在又能知道别人的思想

2211
01:47:42,646 --> 01:47:45,907
now you've devised a way to read minds.

2212
01:47:48,018 --> 01:47:49,642
完全正确

2213
01:47:48,018 --> 01:47:49,642
You betcha!

2214
01:47:49,954 --> 01:47:54,325
我的魔盆即将征服全世界

2215
01:47:49,954 --> 01:47:54,325
Soon my little Box will be on countless TV's around the world...

2216
01:47:54,325 --> 01:47:57,496
我可获得任何人的信用卡号码

2217
01:47:54,325 --> 01:47:57,496
...feeding me credit card numbers...

2218
01:47:57,496 --> 01:47:59,263
银行密码

2219
01:47:57,496 --> 01:47:59,263
...bank codes...

2220
01:47:59,263 --> 01:48:00,898
性幻想

2221
01:47:59,263 --> 01:48:00,898
...sexual fantasies...

2222
01:48:00,898 --> 01:48:03,702
还有所有的小谎言

2223
01:48:00,898 --> 01:48:03,702
...and little white lies.

2224
01:48:03,702 --> 01:48:06,037
这些都在我脑中

2225
01:48:03,702 --> 01:48:06,037
lnto my head they'll go.

2226
01:48:06,037 --> 01:48:08,607
成功指日可待

2227
01:48:06,037 --> 01:48:08,607
Victory is inevitable.

2228
01:48:08,607 --> 01:48:11,561
若知识即力量

2229
01:48:08,607 --> 01:48:11,561
For if knowledge is power...

2230
01:48:12,111 --> 01:48:13,771
那我

2231
01:48:12,111 --> 01:48:13,771
...then a god...

2232
01:48:13,774 --> 01:48:14,805
就是

2233
01:48:13,774 --> 01:48:14,805
...am...

2234
01:48:15,876 --> 01:48:17,050
上帝

2235
01:48:15,876 --> 01:48:17,050
...l!

2236
01:48:23,856 --> 01:48:26,429
这样会不会太夸张了？

2237
01:48:23,856 --> 01:48:26,429
Was that over the top? l can never tell.

2238
01:48:29,796 --> 01:48:33,633
对了，我知道你想什么，畸型

2239
01:48:29,796 --> 01:48:33,633
By the way, l've seen your mind. Freak!

2240
01:48:33,633 --> 01:48:35,702
你脑中存在着世纪之谜

2241
01:48:33,633 --> 01:48:35,702
Yours is the greatest riddle of all!

2242
01:48:35,702 --> 01:48:37,537
布鲁斯韦恩和蝙蝠侠

2243
01:48:35,702 --> 01:48:37,537
Can Bruce Wayne and Batman

2244
01:48:37,537 --> 01:48:40,306
能同时出现吗？

2245
01:48:37,537 --> 01:48:40,306
ever truly coexist?

2246
01:48:40,306 --> 01:48:42,575
今天谜底就会揭晓

2247
01:48:40,306 --> 01:48:42,575
We'll find out today!

2248
01:48:42,575 --> 01:48:48,047
首先欢迎今天的参赛来宾

2249
01:48:42,575 --> 01:48:48,047
But first, let's meet our contestants. Behind curtain...

2250
01:48:48,047 --> 01:48:52,733
布幕后的是一号

2251
01:48:48,047 --> 01:48:52,733
...number one...

2252
01:48:54,488 --> 01:48:58,687
超级美女梅慈丝医生

2253
01:48:54,488 --> 01:48:58,687
...the absolutely fabulous Dr. Chase Meridian!

2254
01:48:58,859 --> 01:49:01,195
她喜欢登山、修指甲...

2255
01:48:58,859 --> 01:49:01,195
She enjoys hiking, manicures...

2256
01:49:01,195 --> 01:49:04,778
以及幻想她是布鲁斯的最爱

2257
01:49:01,195 --> 01:49:04,778
...and foolishly hopes to be the love of Bruce's life.

2258
01:49:09,237 --> 01:49:12,393
二号参赛者

2259
01:49:09,237 --> 01:49:12,393
Number two:

2260
01:49:15,310 --> 01:49:18,213
号称唯一的最佳拍档

2261
01:49:15,310 --> 01:49:18,213
Fatman's one and only partner.

2262
01:49:18,213 --> 01:49:20,515
前空中飞人，现为孤儿

2263
01:49:18,213 --> 01:49:20,515
This acrobat turned orphan...

2264
01:49:20,515 --> 01:49:22,751
他喜欢看卡通，做白日梦

2265
01:49:20,515 --> 01:49:22,751
...likes Saturday morning cartoons and dreams of one day being...

2266
01:49:22,751 --> 01:49:26,985
常幻想和裸体女郎共处

2267
01:49:22,751 --> 01:49:26,985
...bare-naked with a girl.

2268
01:49:29,925 --> 01:49:34,551
在参赛下方是我的杰作

2269
01:49:29,925 --> 01:49:34,551
And below these contestants... ...my personal favorite:

2270
01:49:34,964 --> 01:49:37,775
海上坟场

2271
01:49:34,964 --> 01:49:37,775
...a watery grave.

2272
01:49:38,701 --> 01:49:40,903
只要轻轻碰一下

2273
01:49:38,701 --> 01:49:40,903
Just one little touch...

2274
01:49:40,903 --> 01:49:46,072
五秒后他们就成了海鸥佳肴

2275
01:49:40,903 --> 01:49:46,072
...and five seconds later these two players are... ...gull feed on the rocks below.

2276
01:49:48,945 --> 01:49:51,899
你无法同时救两个

2277
01:49:48,945 --> 01:49:51,899
Not enough time to save them both.

2278
01:49:55,218 --> 01:49:58,188
蝙蝠侠，你要救哪一个？

2279
01:49:55,218 --> 01:49:58,188
Which one will it be, Batman?

2280
01:49:58,188 --> 01:49:59,723
布鲁斯的最爱？

2281
01:49:58,188 --> 01:49:59,723
Bruce's love?

2282
01:49:59,723 --> 01:50:03,057
还是你的菜鸟拍档？

2283
01:49:59,723 --> 01:50:03,057
Or the Dark Knight's junior partner?

2284
01:50:05,162 --> 01:50:08,666
我可能连我自己都救不了

2285
01:50:05,162 --> 01:50:08,666
There is no way for me to save them or myself.

2286
01:50:08,666 --> 01:50:11,097
这是个死亡陷阱

2287
01:50:08,666 --> 01:50:11,097
lt's all one giant death-trap.

2288
01:50:11,435 --> 01:50:13,060
裁判先生？

2289
01:50:11,435 --> 01:50:13,060
Judges?

2290
01:50:13,638 --> 01:50:16,829
抱歉，你的答案不合理

2291
01:50:13,638 --> 01:50:16,829
l'm sorry. Your answer must be in the form of a question.

2292
01:50:16,841 --> 01:50:18,466
感谢您的光临

2293
01:50:16,841 --> 01:50:18,466
But thanks for playing.

2294
01:50:19,044 --> 01:50:22,305
等等，我有个谜语

2295
01:50:19,044 --> 01:50:22,305
Wait! l have a riddle.

2296
01:50:22,446 --> 01:50:27,138
让我猜吗？真的？

2297
01:50:22,446 --> 01:50:27,138
For me? Really?

2298
01:50:29,855 --> 01:50:31,278
快告诉我

2299
01:50:29,855 --> 01:50:31,278
Tell me.

2300
01:50:34,861 --> 01:50:37,296
有眼睛却看不到

2301
01:50:34,861 --> 01:50:37,296
l see without seeing.

2302
01:50:37,296 --> 01:50:41,151
黑夜如同白昼般清晰

2303
01:50:37,296 --> 01:50:41,151
To me, darkness is as clear as daylight.

2304
01:50:41,968 --> 01:50:43,735
我是谁？

2305
01:50:41,968 --> 01:50:43,735
What am l?

2306
01:50:44,469 --> 01:50:46,343
拜！

2307
01:50:44,469 --> 01:50:46,343
Please!

2308
01:50:46,471 --> 01:50:49,609
你跟蝙蝠一样瞎了眼

2309
01:50:46,471 --> 01:50:49,609
You're as blind as a bat!

2310
01:50:49,609 --> 01:50:51,103
完全正确

2311
01:50:49,609 --> 01:50:51,103
Exactly.

2312
01:51:27,649 --> 01:51:29,143
完了

2313
01:51:27,649 --> 01:51:29,143
Bummer!

2314
01:52:33,184 --> 01:52:34,465
谢了

2315
01:52:33,184 --> 01:52:34,465
Thanks.

2316
01:52:48,933 --> 01:52:51,637
逞英雄到头来还是一事无成

2317
01:52:48,933 --> 01:52:51,637
All those heroics for nothing.

2318
01:52:51,637 --> 01:52:53,539
不猜谜语，不跟你玩了

2319
01:52:51,637 --> 01:52:53,539
No more riddles, no more curtains one and two.

2320
01:52:53,539 --> 01:52:56,599
你准备死吧

2321
01:52:53,539 --> 01:52:56,599
Just plain curtains!

2322
01:52:57,376 --> 01:52:59,612
你忘了一件事

2323
01:52:57,376 --> 01:52:59,612
Aren't you forgetting something?

2324
01:52:59,612 --> 01:53:01,485
你的铜板

2325
01:52:59,612 --> 01:53:01,485
Your coin.

2326
01:53:02,615 --> 01:53:05,355
你老是下不了决定

2327
01:53:02,615 --> 01:53:05,355
You're always of two minds.

2328
01:53:06,051 --> 01:53:08,377
没错，你说得对

2329
01:53:06,051 --> 01:53:08,377
Yes, of course. You're right.

2330
01:53:08,555 --> 01:53:11,558
人常为情绪左右而无法自制

2331
01:53:08,555 --> 01:53:11,558
Emotion's always the enemy of justice.

2332
01:53:11,558 --> 01:53:13,669
你真是我的哥儿们

2333
01:53:11,558 --> 01:53:13,669
You've always been a good friend.

2334
01:54:00,275 --> 01:54:02,043
为什么？

2335
01:54:00,275 --> 01:54:02,043
Why?

2336
01:54:02,444 --> 01:54:06,679
为什么永远杀不了你

2337
01:54:02,444 --> 01:54:06,679
Why can't l... ...kill you?

2338
01:54:09,051 --> 01:54:11,198
轩然大波

2339
01:54:09,051 --> 01:54:11,198
Too many questions.

2340
01:54:11,687 --> 01:54:13,490
轩然大波

2341
01:54:11,687 --> 01:54:13,490
Too many questions.

2342
01:54:13,789 --> 01:54:15,521
可怜的家伙

2343
01:54:13,789 --> 01:54:15,521
Poor Edward.

2344
01:54:15,657 --> 01:54:17,983
我一定得救两个

2345
01:54:15,657 --> 01:54:17,983
l had to save them both.

2346
01:54:18,194 --> 01:54:21,597
布鲁斯韦恩就是蝙蝠侠

2347
01:54:18,194 --> 01:54:21,597
You see, l'm both Bruce Wayne and Batman.

2348
01:54:21,597 --> 01:54:23,599
这不只是我的义务

2349
01:54:21,597 --> 01:54:23,599
Not because l have to be.

2350
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:28,011
也是我选择的生活方式

2351
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:28,011
Now... ...because l choose to be.

2352
01:54:46,524 --> 01:54:49,062
阿甘精神病院

2353
01:54:51,028 --> 01:54:54,397
梅医生，谢谢您前来会诊

2354
01:54:51,028 --> 01:54:54,397
Thank you for responding to my request for a consultation, Dr. Meridian.

2355
01:54:55,599 --> 01:54:56,840
艾德华尼格玛一直鬼叫鬼喊

2356
01:54:55,599 --> 01:54:56,840
Edward Nygma...

2357
01:54:56,840 --> 01:55:02,438
宣称他知道蝙蝠侠的真实身份

2358
01:54:56,840 --> 01:55:02,438
...has been screaming for hours that he knows the true identity... ...of Batman.

2359
01:55:16,288 --> 01:55:17,782
艾德华

2360
01:55:16,288 --> 01:55:17,782
Edward?

2361
01:55:18,424 --> 01:55:21,184
是谁呀？

2362
01:55:18,424 --> 01:55:21,184
Who... ...is it?

2363
01:55:23,963 --> 01:55:27,118
我是梅慈丝医生

2364
01:55:23,963 --> 01:55:27,118
lt's Dr. Meridian. Chase.

2365
01:55:27,634 --> 01:55:29,710
记得我吗？

2366
01:55:27,634 --> 01:55:29,710
Do you remember me?

2367
01:55:31,770 --> 01:55:34,166
怎么忘得了呢？

2368
01:55:31,770 --> 01:55:34,166
How could l forget?

2369
01:55:34,807 --> 01:55:37,477
波顿医生告诉我...

2370
01:55:34,807 --> 01:55:37,477
Dr. Burton tells me...

2371
01:55:37,844 --> 01:55:40,798
你知道谁是蝙蝠侠

2372
01:55:37,844 --> 01:55:40,798
...you know who Batman is.

2373
01:55:40,981 --> 01:55:45,145
你不说“请”我就不告诉你

2374
01:55:40,981 --> 01:55:45,145
l can't tell you if you don't say, ''please.''

2375
01:55:45,218 --> 01:55:47,543
艾德华，请问你

2376
01:55:45,218 --> 01:55:47,543
Edward, please.

2377
01:55:47,621 --> 01:55:50,468
谁是蝙蝠侠

2378
01:55:47,621 --> 01:55:50,468
Who is Batman?

2379
01:55:51,592 --> 01:55:54,489
就...是...我

2380
01:55:51,592 --> 01:55:54,489
l'm... ...Batman.

2381
01:56:20,488 --> 01:56:22,924
你的秘密安全得很

2382
01:56:20,488 --> 01:56:22,924
Your secret is safe.

2383
01:56:22,924 --> 01:56:25,894
他百分之百是个狂人

2384
01:56:22,924 --> 01:56:25,894
He is definitely a wacko.

2385
01:56:25,894 --> 01:56:27,429
狂人

2386
01:56:25,894 --> 01:56:27,429
Wacko.

2387
01:56:27,429 --> 01:56:31,142
这是心理学专有名词吗？

2388
01:56:27,429 --> 01:56:31,142
ls that a technical term? Listen...

2389
01:56:34,437 --> 01:56:37,698
我想我不需要这个了

2390
01:56:34,437 --> 01:56:37,698
...l won't need this anymore.

2391
01:56:39,909 --> 01:56:44,072
感谢你让我有了新的美梦

2392
01:56:39,909 --> 01:56:44,072
Thank you for giving me a new dream.

2393
01:56:59,496 --> 01:57:01,821
别工作得太晚了

2394
01:56:59,496 --> 01:57:01,821
Don't work too late.

2395
01:57:28,993 --> 01:57:31,282
剧终
