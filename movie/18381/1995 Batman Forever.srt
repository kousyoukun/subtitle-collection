-1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
永远的蝙蝠侠

1
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:54,188
要带个三明治吗？
Can l persuade you to take a sandwich?

2
00:01:54,263 --> 00:01:56,516
我会买“外带”在车上吃
l'll get drive-through.

3
00:02:37,142 --> 00:02:40,446
你想靠那正义使者来救你？
You're counting on the winged avenger to deliver you from evil...

4
00:02:40,446 --> 00:02:42,628
是吧？老兄！
...aren't you, my friend?

5
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:45,517
你要杀我吗？
Are you going to kill me?

6
00:02:45,517 --> 00:02:49,444
那倒不一定，我们还没决定好
Maybe, maybe not. We're of two minds on the subject.

7
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,237
赌一把怎么样？
You a gambling man?

8
00:02:54,927 --> 00:02:57,631
来丢铜板决定如何？
What say we flip for it?

9
00:02:57,831 --> 00:03:01,066
有人生来是英雄，有人是狗熊
One man is born a hero, his brother a coward.

10
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:04,771
朱门酒肉臭，路有冻死骨
Babies starve, politicians grow fat...

11
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:08,908
黄钟毁弃，瓦斧雷鸣
...holy men are martyred, and junkies grow legion.

12
00:03:08,908 --> 00:03:10,376
为什么？
Why?

13
00:03:10,376 --> 00:03:13,009
为什么？为什么？为什么？
Why, why, why, why, why?

14
00:03:14,314 --> 00:03:15,482
狗屎运！
Luck!

15
00:03:15,482 --> 00:03:21,931
盲目愚蠢！毫无理由的狗屎运
Blind, stupid, simple, doo-dah... ...clueless luck!

16
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:29,263
只有丢铜板才有公平可言
The random toss... ...is the only true justice.

17
00:03:29,263 --> 00:03:35,009
看看你老兄这回运气如何？
Let's see what justice has in store... ...for you.

18
00:03:40,142 --> 00:03:42,210
一切交给上帝吧！
lt's like the touch of God.

19
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,799
等一下！
Wait, wait, wait.

20
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:48,550
你狗运不赖嘛！
Fortune smiles. Another day of wine and roses.

21
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,987
该喝啤酒吃披萨庆祝
ln your case, beer and pizza.

22
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:53,789
喂！我们该出发了
Out of here, guys!

23
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:56,525
你说你会让我活命 没错
-But you said you'd let me live! -Too true!

24
00:03:56,525 --> 00:04:00,269
留你当活饵，引诱那只大蝙蝠 太酷了！
And so you shall! Nothing's better than live bait to trap a bat.

25
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:17,699
真精彩的出场
Hot entrance.

26
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:19,382
双面人吗？
Two-Face?

27
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:20,718
两名警卫丧生
2 guards are dead.

28
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,152
警方没料到他会挟持人质
He's holding a third hostage. Didn't see this one coming.

29
00:04:23,152 --> 00:04:24,654
我们早该想到
We should have.

30
00:04:24,654 --> 00:04:26,386
高谭市第二银行
The 2nd Bank of Gotham.

31
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:28,626
我逮捕他的两周年纪念
2nd anniversary of the day l captured him.

32
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:30,393
难怪他要再犯案
How could he resist?

33
00:04:30,394 --> 00:04:31,829
我是梅慈丝
l'm Chase Meridian.

34
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:35,065
我请她担任本案顾问，她是...
l asked her to come to here to consult on the case. She specializes in--

35
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:39,803
心理学，多重人格理论专家 我早已拜读大作
Psychology, multiple personalities. l read your work.

36
00:04:39,803 --> 00:04:41,105
见解独到！
lnsightful.

37
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:42,907
很天真，不过见解独特！
Naive, but insightful.

38
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,508
真令我受宠若惊
l'm flattered.

39
00:04:44,508 --> 00:04:47,012
不是每个女人都能有此殊荣的
Not every girl makes a superhero's night table.

40
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:48,178
能跟他讲道理吗？
Can we reason with him?

41
00:04:48,178 --> 00:04:51,149
他手里有人质 和他谈判有用
-He's got innocent people up there. -lt won't do any good.

42
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:54,221
这家伙杀人不眨眼 我同意
-He'll slaughter them without a thought. -Agreed.

43
00:04:54,286 --> 00:04:57,555
心灵的重创令他人格产生分裂
A trauma powerful enough to create an alternate personality leaves one--

44
00:04:57,555 --> 00:05:00,792
社会的规则秩序完全置之不理
ln a world where normal rules of right and wrong no longer apply.

45
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:01,823
完全正确
Exactly.

46
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,962
就像你一样
Like you.

47
00:05:03,962 --> 00:05:06,499
我可以好好写一本书来探讨
l could write a hell of a paper

48
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:09,935
一个男人为何穿得像啮齿动物
on a grown man dressing like a flying rodent.

49
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:13,239
蝙蝠不是啮齿动物，梅医生
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.

50
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:15,508
真的？这我倒不知道
Really? l didn't know that.

51
00:05:15,508 --> 00:05:17,975
你真有意思
You are interesting.

52
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:21,695
叫我慈丝
And call me Chase.

53
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:24,851
对了，你贵姓？
By the way, do you have a first name,

54
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:27,448
或者我可以称你蝙蝠吗？
or do l call you Bats?

55
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:35,169
让我们玩个痛快吧？
Start the party with a bang!

56
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:47,141
连送死都这么准时
Very punctual, even for his own funeral. Boys!

57
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:49,845
兄弟们，宰了他！
Kill the Bat!

58
00:06:01,222 --> 00:06:02,847
开枪！
Blast him!

59
00:06:15,037 --> 00:06:17,089
芝麻开门！
Open sesame.

60
00:07:21,572 --> 00:07:22,960
这是陷阱！
lt's a trap!

61
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:00,746
各位亲爱的高谭市民请注意
Attention citizens of fair Gotham!

62
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,052
等我们开了保险箱
When we open that safe,

63
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,820
什么就都有了
we'll have everything we ever wanted...

64
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,303
足够让高谭市天下大乱
...enough cash to rain down upon fair Gotham a glorious flood of chaos.

65
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:17,113
当然，你这龟儿子是死定了
And, of course... ...you, my boy, dead!

66
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:21,805
那是强酸液体
lt's boiling acid!

67
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,729
为了让你死得愉快
For your dying pleasure,

68
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:26,311
请享用美味大补汤
we are serving the acid that made us the men we are!

69
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:31,749
抓牢了
Hold on.

70
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,531

Haul away!

71

快吊走
Yes! Haul away!

72
00:08:44,326 --> 00:08:45,013
手给我
-Give me your hand.

73
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:46,486
别放手哇！
-Don't let go!

74
00:08:52,402 --> 00:08:53,932
这东西给我
l must borrow this.

75
00:08:57,006 --> 00:08:59,332
那是我的助听器
That's my hearing aid!

76
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:00,555
谢谢
Thanks.

77
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:08,348
天啊，我的鞋子要溶化了
Wow! My shoes are melting!

78
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:18,426
救命！
No more!

79
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:31,368



80
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:35,514
抓紧了
Hang on.

81
00:09:35,514 --> 00:09:36,866
抓紧？
Hang on?

82

快让他下来
Get him down. Get him down.

83
00:10:01,274 --> 00:10:03,971
快 小心点
Take it easy with him.

84
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,555
你没事的
You'll be all right.

85
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:06,646
放轻松
Just stay calm.

86
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:09,633
小心！让他慢慢下来


87
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:20,765
这下他没救了！
This'll fix him!

88
00:10:27,368 --> 00:10:28,755
抓牢啊！
Hang on!

89
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,560
我来仔细瞧瞧
Let's see.

90
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,028
太棒了！
Yes!

91
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:56,741
是...多么快乐的一天
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Oh, happy day!

92
00:10:58,134 --> 00:11:02,855
向那只尖耳的夜行鼠辈永别了
Farewell forever to that... ...pointy-eared night rat!

93
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:06,020
双面人
Face!

94
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,534
你需要心理治疗，投降吧！
You need help. Give it up.

95
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,064
这次让你死得有点品味
Have the good taste to die!

96
00:11:59,064 --> 00:12:00,344
再见了
See you!

97
00:12:40,974 --> 00:12:43,844
尽管昨晚蝙蝠侠奋不顾身追捕
Despite a valiant effort last night by Batman...

98
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:47,848
危险人物双面人仍侥幸逃脱
...Harvey Two-Face is still at large and extremely dangerous.

99
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:49,316

请到研发部参观吧

111
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:36,984
你是...
Mister...?

112
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:40,503
奥！布鲁斯韦恩
Oh, Bruce Wayne.

113
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:43,440
那是我，阁下是？
No, that's my name. And you are?

114
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,740
尼格玛

艾德华
Edward.

116

是您亲自雇用我的
Edward Nygma. You hired me personally.

117
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:51,215
我都这么告诉别人
Just like l tell everyone.

118
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:53,116
事实上我们倒没见过面
We've never actually met,

119
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:57,244
不过你的名字在我雇用合约上
but your name was on the hiring slip. l have it.

有人一直不肯让我们见面

我们都在想些什么？
What's on all our minds?

132
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:23,763
脑波...
Brain waves.

133
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:34,326
韦恩企业集团未来希望之所系
The future... ...of Wayne Enterprises... ...is brain waves.

134
00:14:35,661 --> 00:14:36,962
真抱歉，韦恩先生

将电视讯号发射入人脑中
...beams any TV signal directly into the human brain.

140
00:14:57,751 --> 00:15:01,554
借刺激中子以操控脑波
By stimulating neurons, manipulating brain waves...

141
00:15:01,554 --> 00:15:04,225
这机器可让他电视观众

142
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:07,862
仿佛成为剧中人物身历其境
feel like they're inside the show.

143
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:10,531
完全忘却俗世纷扰
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world?

144
00:15:10,531 --> 00:15:14,529
你刚刚说“操控脑波”吗？
Did you say ''manipulating brain waves?''

145
00:15:16,637 --> 00:15:18,226
是的
Yes.

146
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,141
不过...
But...

147
00:15:20,141 --> 00:15:24,246
像您这种大人物不会需要的
...someone like you would never need it.

148
00:15:24,246 --> 00:15:31,018
如此聪明、机智、迷人的名人
Someone so... ...intelligent, witty and... ...charming.

149
00:15:31,018 --> 00:15:33,922
我需要资金来作人体实验
l need a bit of additional funding for human trials.

150
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:36,024
来，我来示范
Let me show you, please!

151
00:15:36,024 --> 00:15:39,963
我要看详细的设计计划
Now, listen... ...l want a full set of schematics on this, okay?

152
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:42,831
布鲁斯，我们会成为合作伙伴
We'll be full partners in this, Bruce.

153
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:46,336
你看，我们是天生最佳拍挡
Look at us! Two of a kind!

154
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:49,846
打电话给我助理，她会安排
You call my assistant, Margaret. She'll set something up.

155
00:15:49,973 --> 00:15:53,590
很明显，你在敷衍我
That's not... ...going to be good for me.

156
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,946
给我一个肯定的答案
l need an answer now.

157
00:15:56,946 --> 00:15:59,315
这是我该得的
l think l deserve it.

158
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:02,752
抱歉，你的要求恕难同意
l'm sorry, then the answer is no.

159
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:05,189
干扰人类脑波
Tampering with people's brain waves...

160
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:07,624
思想操控机器
...mind manipulation...

161
00:16:07,624 --> 00:16:10,793
恐怕会引起轩然大波
...it just raises too many questions.

162
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:12,074
抱歉
Sorry.

163
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,429
多谢大家，谢谢你们的努力
Thanks, keep up the good work. Looks great.

164
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:16,734
好了，各位
All right, everyone!

165
00:16:16,734 --> 00:16:18,335
继续工作
Back to work!

166
00:16:18,335 --> 00:16:21,005
等一下再跟你算帐
We'll discuss this later!

167
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,651
你怎么可以让我失望
You were supposed to understand.

168
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:35,220
我会让你认识清楚
l'll make you understand.

169
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,047
锁上
Lock.

170
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,650
启动
Chair.

171
00:16:56,374 --> 00:16:58,978
讯号收到
l saw the signal.

172
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:00,887
一切准备就绪
All is ready.

173
00:17:40,788 --> 00:17:42,390
局长，他人呢？
Commissioner?

174
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,884
他回家了
He's home.

175
00:17:44,793 --> 00:17:47,629
是我发的讯号
l sent the signal.

176
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:49,681
怎么回事？
What's wrong?

177
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:55,070
昨晚我注意到双面人一件事
Last night l noticed something about Two-Face:

178
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,694
他的铜板
his coin.

179
00:17:56,704 --> 00:17:58,440
那是他的弱点
lt's his Achilles' heel.

180
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,142
可以好好研究一下
lt can be exploited.

181
00:18:00,142 --> 00:18:01,977
我知道了
l know.

182
00:18:01,977 --> 00:18:03,912
你叫我来就为了这个？
You called me for this?

183
00:18:03,912 --> 00:18:06,582
我的呼叫器可不是BB机
The Batsignal is not a beeper.

184
00:18:06,582 --> 00:18:11,303
你对我的吸引力不只在公事上
l wish l could say that my interest in you was... ...purely professional.

185
00:18:11,454 --> 00:18:13,823
你在挑逗我吗？
You trying to get under my cape?

186
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:17,426
女人整天研究精神病很寂寞的
A girl can't live by psychoses alone.

187
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:20,864
是那部车吧？马子喜欢搔包车
lt's the car, right? Chicks love it.

188
00:18:20,864 --> 00:18:24,033
为什么坏男人总是吸引着我
What is it about the wrong kind of man?

189
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:27,237
高中时是戴耳环的痞子
ln grade school: guys with earrings.

190
00:18:27,237 --> 00:18:30,474
大学是骑机车，穿皮夹克的
College: motorcycles, leather jackets.

191
00:18:30,474 --> 00:18:32,727
现在嘛...
Now...

192
00:18:34,878 --> 00:18:37,748
黑色橡皮衣的男子
...black rubber.

193
00:18:37,748 --> 00:18:40,938
试试救火员，脱衣服比较方便
Try a fireman. Less to take off.

194
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,671
这我不在乎
l don't mind the work.

195
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:45,856
只可惜看不到你的真面目
Pity l can't see behind the mask.

196
00:18:45,856 --> 00:18:47,659
每个人都戴着面具过日子
We all wear masks.

197
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,593
我的生命是本打开的书
My life's an open book.

198
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:51,095
想看看吗
You read?

199
00:18:51,095 --> 00:18:53,633
我不想在人家家里野餐
l don't blend in at a family picnic.

200
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,998
我们可以试试，我会准备酒
We could give it a try. l'll bring the wine...

201
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:02,365
你带着你受创的灵魂前来
...you bring your scarred psyche.

202
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,443
你很主动，是吧？
Direct, aren't you?

203
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:07,045
你喜欢主动的女人
You like strong women.

204
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,781
我对你研究过
l've done my homework.

205
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:12,717
还是要我穿紧身衣带皮鞭？
Or do l need skintight vinyl and a whip?

206
00:19:12,717 --> 00:19:15,453
我对女人向来不在行
l haven't had much luck with women.

207
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:18,407
也许是对象不适合
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman.

208
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,464
我收到了讯号
l saw the signal.

209
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,465
怎么呢？
-What's going on?

210
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,162
没事
-Nothing.

211
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:30,503
真的没事
False alarm.

212
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,033
是吗？
Are you sure?

213
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:52,268
女人啊！
Women.

214
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,959
成功了！
Now l've got it!

215
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:10,154
轩然大波，引起轩然大波
Too many questions. There's too many questions.

216
00:20:10,154 --> 00:20:13,615
轩然大波...
Too many....

217
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:15,384
我就证明给你看
l'll show you it works!

218
00:20:15,384 --> 00:20:17,785
你到底在胡搞什么
What the hell is going on here?!

219
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:19,822
这个计划已经被终止
l told you this project is terminated!

220
00:20:19,822 --> 00:20:22,075
我要叫警卫来
l'm calling security!

221
00:20:27,696 --> 00:20:29,878
咖啡因有碍你健康
Caffeine will kill you!

222
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,905
天鼠先生，醒来吧
Rise and shine, little guinea pig.

223
00:20:36,905 --> 00:20:38,508
你在干嘛！
What are you doing?

224
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:39,843
快放了我
Untie me!

225
00:20:39,843 --> 00:20:41,611
反正又不会痛
This won't hurt.

226
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:44,280
至少我是这样认为
Least, l don't think it will.

227
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:46,616
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

228
00:20:46,616 --> 00:20:49,686
你敢碰那开关...
You touch that switch and--

229
00:20:49,686 --> 00:20:51,180
这个吗？
This?

230
00:21:06,404 --> 00:21:08,239
画面不见了
Losing resolution.

231
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:09,792
能量加强
More power!

232
00:21:33,231 --> 00:21:35,000
艾德华尼格玛
Edward Nygma!

233
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,835
请准备上场
You're the next contestant on...

234
00:21:36,835 --> 00:21:40,476
脑力激荡超级秀
...Brain Drain!

235
00:21:40,973 --> 00:21:45,437
我选看起来笨头笨脑的1号
l'll take what's inside thick skull number one!

236
00:21:45,445 --> 00:21:48,114
他能得到什么大奖
What have we got for him?

237
00:21:48,114 --> 00:21:52,318
史帝雷，这是我研究的大突破
Oh, Stickley, l'm having a breakthrough!

238
00:21:52,318 --> 00:21:53,953
你准备抓狂吧
And a breakdown!

239
00:21:53,953 --> 00:21:56,385
反正我是个大天才
Nevertheless, l'm smarter. l'm a genius.

240
00:21:56,756 --> 00:21:59,492
不对，是超级天才
No, several geniuses.

241
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:05,466
比弗洛依德还厉害的旷世奇才
A gaggle, a swarm... ...a flock of freaking Freuds!

242
00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:07,935
猜猜看
Riddle me this, Fred.

243
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:10,337
什么东西对一个人很重要
What is everything to someone...

244
00:22:10,337 --> 00:22:12,773
对别人却微不足道？
...and nothing to everyone else?

245
00:22:12,773 --> 00:22:14,975
是您老兄的智力
Your mind, baby!

246
00:22:14,975 --> 00:22:17,511
现在我俩智力将彼此共享
Now mine pumps with the power of yours!

247
00:22:17,511 --> 00:22:21,348
你的智慧归我所有
l'm sucking up your lQ

248
00:22:21,348 --> 00:22:25,239
我会把你的大脑皮质
Vacuuming your cortex

249
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:31,743
吸得一干二净
Feeding off your brain

250
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:53,428
太刺激了！
What a rush!

251
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,402
发生什么事？
What just happened?

252
00:22:58,955 --> 00:23:01,858
一点小小的副作用
A very surprising side effect.

253
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:05,796
当您沉醉在我的立体电视之时
While you were mesmerized by my 3-D TV...

254
00:23:05,796 --> 00:23:09,099
我用你中枢能量让我更聪明了
...l used your neural energy to grow smarter.

255
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:11,835
大老板说得没错
Bruce Wayne was right!

256
00:23:11,835 --> 00:23:15,133
你这个疯子、怪胎
You demented, bizarre, unethical toad!

257
00:23:15,172 --> 00:23:17,508
这是非法脑波干扰
lt is brain manipulation!

258
00:23:17,508 --> 00:23:18,909
我要检举你
l'm reporting you to the FCC!

259
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:21,745
非法从事人体实验！
The human experimentation board! The AMl!

260
00:23:21,745 --> 00:23:23,847
我会向警方报告
And the police!

261
00:23:23,847 --> 00:23:26,083
你准备坐牢吧！
You are going up on charges...

262
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:31,113
我看你也得进疯人院
...to court, to jail... ...and then to a mental institution forever!

263
00:23:31,122 --> 00:23:35,359
你现在就被开除了！滚吧！
But, first and foremost, Nygma, you are fired!

264
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,648
听到吗？快滚吧！
Do you hear me? Fired!

265
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:44,527
那可不一定
l don't think so.

266
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,103
救命啊！
Help!

267
00:24:02,922 --> 00:24:04,131
抓紧啊！
Hang on!

268
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:09,161
老兄！
Babe!

269
00:24:09,161 --> 00:24:12,560
你被开除了！
You are fired!

270
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:15,535
或者该说是...
Or should l say...

271
00:24:15,535 --> 00:24:17,480
被“终结”了？
...terminated?

272
00:24:21,975 --> 00:24:24,608
再见了，蠢才
Surf's up, Big Kahuna!

273
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:31,318
姿势不错，可惜落水不佳
Nice form, but rough on the landing.

274
00:24:31,318 --> 00:24:33,915
大概只能得铜牌
He may have to settle for the Bronze.

275
00:24:38,425 --> 00:24:41,262
猜个谜语，韦恩先生
Questions, Mr. Wayne?

276
00:24:41,262 --> 00:24:45,300
我的实验会造成轩然大波
My work raises too many questions.

277
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:51,117
怎么没人给你好好上一课呢？
Why hasn't anybody... ...put you in your place?

278
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:55,677
前任高谭市首席检察官丹特
Harvey Dent, once Gotham's District Attorney...

279
00:24:55,677 --> 00:24:59,114
在法庭上遭黑社会以毒液毁容
...was horribly scarred by underworld kingpin, Boss Moroni.

280
00:24:59,114 --> 00:25:01,216
蝙蝠侠曾企图阻止不及
Although Batman tried to save him...

281
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:03,519
丹特左半脸严重毁损
...Dent's left-brain damage

282
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:06,454
心理失衡导致他成为知名罪犯
turned him into a violent criminal...

283
00:25:06,454 --> 00:25:08,524
并归咎蝙蝠侠誓言报复
...who blamed Batman and who has vowed to destroy him.

284
00:25:08,524 --> 00:25:10,859
双面人现为超级要犯
Harvey Two-Face is extremely dangerous,

285
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:13,262
请大家提高警觉

286
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,031
局长来电
That was the Commissioner.

287
00:25:15,031 --> 00:25:17,852
公司里出意外了
There's been an accident at Wayne Enterprises.

288
00:25:19,828 --> 00:25:21,524
死得真惨
Horrible way to die.

289
00:25:21,537 --> 00:25:23,707
电眼监视器在那边
The surveillance cameras are down here.

290
00:25:23,707 --> 00:25:25,408
我们会尽量努力搜索
We'll dredge the river, but with that current,

291
00:25:25,408 --> 00:25:27,805
不过可能找不到尸体了
l doubt we'll find the body.

292
00:25:31,582 --> 00:25:33,183
为什么？
Why?

293
00:25:33,183 --> 00:25:36,409
天啊！为什么
Oh, why?

294
00:25:37,354 --> 00:25:39,690
我不敢相信！
l just can't believe it.

295
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,360
同事这么多年了
Two years working in the same office.

296
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:47,058
他和我情同父子，有如手足
He was like my father... ...my brother...

297
00:25:47,198 --> 00:25:49,967
我俩简直就是哥儿们
...or a cousin that visits a lot.

298
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:52,328
艾德华，你要节哀
Get a grip, Edward.

299
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:55,473
我在他房间发现这个
l found this in my cubicle.

300
00:25:55,473 --> 00:25:57,508
就是他亲笔写的
You'll find the handwriting matches his,

301
00:25:57,508 --> 00:26:00,355
连遣词用字都一样
as does the sentence structure.

302
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:06,417
我无法再待在这里了
l couldn't possibly continue on here.

303
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:10,688
这么多痛苦的回忆
The memories....

304
00:26:11,457 --> 00:26:14,593
这是昨晚的监视器记录
This is last night's security log.

305
00:26:14,593 --> 00:26:16,989
那是史帝雷
There's Stickley.

306
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,774
事实很清楚了
Pretty cut and dry.

307
00:26:24,136 --> 00:26:26,567
别矣！这个残酷的世界！


308
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:32,255
确实是自杀无疑
Yes, definitely suicide.

309
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:36,077
谢谢您合作，我们会保持联络
Thanks very much for your help, Bruce. We'll be in touch.

310
00:26:39,486 --> 00:26:42,757
史帝雷自杀毫无道理
Stickley's suicide doesn't make sense.

311
00:26:42,757 --> 00:26:44,859
全额保险给付给他家庭
l want full benefits for his family.

312
00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:47,260
可是自杀死亡保险不理赔
Suicide's not covered by our policy.

313
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,920
我知道，全额给付
l know. Full benefits.

314
00:26:48,928 --> 00:26:51,165
记者一直打电话来询问
Gossip Gerty called 32 times.

315
00:26:51,165 --> 00:26:53,099
你准备带谁参加慈善马戏表演
Who are you taking to the Charity Circus?

316
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:55,970
我决定了会告诉你，这是什么
l'll let you know. What's this?

317
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,429
不知道
l don't know.

318
00:26:57,605 --> 00:26:59,372
不知是谁送来的
l didn't see anyone.

319
00:27:08,617 --> 00:27:11,153
看着我脸上的数字
''lf you look at the numbers on my face...

320
00:27:11,153 --> 00:27:13,964
你永远找不到13
''...you won't find 13 anyplace.''

321
00:27:14,423 --> 00:27:15,917
真恶心
That's hideous.

322
00:27:15,924 --> 00:27:17,513
这什么意思
What does it mean?

323
00:27:17,526 --> 00:27:19,326
这个是谜语
lt's a riddle.

324
00:27:19,326 --> 00:27:22,164
脸上的数字...13
''Numbers on my face...13.''

325
00:27:22,164 --> 00:27:23,565
一到十二
1 through 12.

326
00:27:23,565 --> 00:27:25,617
答案是时钟
The answer is a clock.

327
00:27:25,634 --> 00:27:28,337
谁会没事送个谜语给你？
Who would send you a riddle?

328
00:27:28,337 --> 00:27:31,444
这个嘛...倒也是个谜
That, Maggie... ...is the riddle.

329
00:28:15,587 --> 00:28:17,983
猜猜我今天干了什么好事
Guess what l did today?

330
00:28:44,717 --> 00:28:47,078
韦恩大老板
Wayne Manor.

331
00:28:56,128 --> 00:28:57,718
走着瞧
See you soon.

332
00:29:28,763 --> 00:29:31,574
我约了梅博士，谢谢
Dr. Meridian, please. Thank you.

333
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:05,460
我...大概来早了
l... ...guess l'm early.

334
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:08,317
我和你约了时间
l have an appointment.

335
00:30:08,338 --> 00:30:10,306
我是布鲁斯韦恩
l'm Bruce Wayne.

336
00:30:10,306 --> 00:30:14,478
太好了，那你可以赔我一扇门
Good. You can afford a door.

337
00:30:14,478 --> 00:30:15,794
抱歉
l'm sorry.

338
00:30:17,748 --> 00:30:23,954
我在外面听到声音...
You...sounded like you were in...

339
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:29,169
以为你有什么麻烦
...you know, trouble.

340
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,297
这是我宣泄暴力的方式
l prefer healthy expressions of violence

341
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:35,179
以免我把门给拆了
as opposed to breaking in.

342
00:30:35,475 --> 00:30:36,578
好吧
So...

343
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,889
有什么可效劳的吗？
...how can l help you?

344
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,277
有人不断寄情书给我
Someone's been sending me love letters.

345
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:49,481
一封寄到办公室，一封寄到家
One at my office and one at my home.

346
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:53,716
戈登局长说可以听听您的高见
Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your opinion.

347
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:58,640
时钟
A clock.

348
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:00,251
时钟
Clock.

349
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:08,067
把我折断，摩擦我的头
''Tear one off and scratch my head...

350
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:11,328
红头随后成黑头
''...what once was red is black instead.''

351
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:14,278
火柴
A match.

352
00:31:19,412 --> 00:31:22,473
我看这家伙是个狂人
My opinion: this letter writer is a wacko.

353
00:31:22,616 --> 00:31:23,825
狂人？
Wacko?

354
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:26,151
心理学名词吗？
That a technical term?

355
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:32,025
典型患者具有沉迷杀人之倾向
Patient may suffer from obsession... ...with potential homicidal tendencies.

356
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:33,934
够专业吗？
ls that better for you?

357
00:31:34,095 --> 00:31:35,530
所以基本上你认为...
So, what you're saying is...

358
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,465
这家伙是个疯子
...this guy's a total wacko.

359
00:31:37,465 --> 00:31:39,339
完全正确
Exactly.

360
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:42,436
他疯狂地对你着迷
He's obsessed with you.

361
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:45,770
只有摧毁偏执对象能自我救赎
His only escape may be to purge the fixation.

362
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:48,500
就是把我宰了
To kill me.

363
00:31:48,977 --> 00:31:51,303
看不出来你还蛮有概念的
l think you understand obsession better than you let on.

364
00:31:55,616 --> 00:31:57,384
喜欢蝙蝠吗？
You like bats?

365
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,816
那是一种心理测验
That's a Rorschach, Mr. Wayne.

366
00:31:59,822 --> 00:32:01,490
又称墨迹测验
An inkblot.

367
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,258
人们只被想看的墨点所吸引
People see what they want.

368
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:07,319
问题在于，你喜欢蝙蝠吗？
The question is, do you like bats?

369
00:32:09,598 --> 00:32:11,851
你还在玩这个？
Still playing with dolls?

370
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:15,604
她是马来人的守护神
She's a Malaysian dream warden.

371
00:32:15,604 --> 00:32:19,245
他们相信她能让你不做恶梦
Some cultures believe she protects you from bad dreams.

372
00:32:19,743 --> 00:32:22,625
你一定觉得有点可笑
lt's silly to you, l'm sure.

373
00:32:26,316 --> 00:32:28,783
你看起来不太好
You look so sad.

374
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,915
需要一个娃娃吗？
Do you need one?

375
00:32:32,023 --> 00:32:34,727
我？谢了，有此必要吗？
Me? No. Why would l?

376
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,131
你看起来十分心神不宁
You're not exactly what you seem, are you?

377
00:32:40,131 --> 00:32:43,844
你到底为什么来此找我？
What is it you really came here for?

378
00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:47,200
呃，时间到了
Yikes, time's up.

379
00:32:48,572 --> 00:32:51,108
通常这句话该由我来说
That's usually my line.

380
00:32:51,108 --> 00:32:52,745
我真希望能再多聊会儿
l'd love to stay here chatting.

381
00:32:52,745 --> 00:32:55,279
真的吗？
Would you?

382
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,113
我可不太相信
l'm not so sure.

383
00:32:56,113 --> 00:33:00,751
我希望你把这身衣服脱掉
l must get you out of those clothes.

384
00:33:00,751 --> 00:33:02,054
什么？
Excuse me?

385
00:33:02,054 --> 00:33:04,356
换上黑色晚礼服
And into a black dress.

386
00:33:04,356 --> 00:33:06,953
医生，你喜欢马戏表演吗？
Tell me, doctor, do you like the circus?

387
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:09,194
巨蛋体育馆


388
00:33:09,194 --> 00:33:11,863
高谭市马戏慈善表演


389
00:33:25,877 --> 00:33:28,867
各位先生，各位先生
Ladies and gentlemen...

390
00:33:28,915 --> 00:33:30,504
各位小朋友
...boys and girls of all ages...

391
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,120
欢迎观赏全世界最伟大的表演
...welcome to the greatest show on earth!

392
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,023
这位高贵的女士是谁？
Who is this beautiful young woman you're with?

393
00:33:37,023 --> 00:33:38,559
梅慈丝医师
Dr. Chase Meridian.

394
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,827
医师？
A doctor?

395
00:33:39,827 --> 00:33:41,356
那一种医生？
What kind of doctor?

396
00:33:41,527 --> 00:33:43,729
门票收入将捐给市立儿童医院
...for Gotham Children's Hospital.

397
00:33:43,729 --> 00:33:48,235
让我们感谢最高金额捐款人
Let's thank our largest single donor:

398
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,524
布鲁斯韦恩
Bruce Wayne!

399
00:33:51,538 --> 00:33:53,841
各位女士先生
Ladies and gentlemen...

400
00:33:53,841 --> 00:33:56,610
将在离地七十尺高空中
...70 feet above the ground...

401
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:00,147
表演令您叹为观止的特技
...performing feats of unimaginable aerial skill...

402
00:34:00,147 --> 00:34:02,721
空中飞人葛瑞森家族！
...the Flying Graysons!

403
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,451
我周末要去攀岩
Listen.... l'm going rock climbing this weekend. Would you join me?

404
00:35:00,844 --> 00:35:03,680
呃！我很想去
l'd like to.

405
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,156
我喜欢攀岩，真的
l love climbing. l really love it.

406
00:35:07,484 --> 00:35:08,765
但是？
But?

407
00:35:09,086 --> 00:35:10,675
我有对象了
l've met someone.

408
00:35:11,656 --> 00:35:14,292
那可真快，你才刚搬来不久
That's fast work. You just moved here.

409
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:18,663
就像一时天雷勾动地火...
You could say he... ...dropped out of the sky and...

410
00:35:18,663 --> 00:35:20,395
一发不可收拾
...bang!

411
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:23,768
我觉得对方也同样来电
l think he felt it too.

412
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:25,103
他的确如此
He sure did.

413
00:35:25,103 --> 00:35:26,835
什么？
What?

414
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,298
谁抗拒得了呢？
Who wouldn't?

415
00:35:30,209 --> 00:35:37,015
接下来由飞人家族最年轻成员
Now... ...Richard... ...the youngest flying Grayson...

416
00:35:37,015 --> 00:35:41,665
李查表演惊心动魄的死亡翻滚
...will perform the awe-inspiring... ...death drop...

417
00:35:42,688 --> 00:35:45,713
安全网将全部撤走
...without the safety... ...of a net!

418
00:36:05,012 --> 00:36:06,313
上场了
Let's go.

419
00:36:06,313 --> 00:36:07,665
别紧张
You'll be okay.

420
00:36:43,419 --> 00:36:47,132
各位女士先生
Ladies... ...and gentlemen!

421
00:36:47,756 --> 00:36:50,859
新任马戏班主任现在请大家
Now, the new management of the circus invites you to forget...

422
00:36:50,859 --> 00:36:53,729
暂时忘记这些有趣的表演
...this good, wholesome fun...

423
00:36:53,729 --> 00:36:56,365
一起加入我们的混乱之夜
...and join us in a celebration of chaos...

424
00:36:56,365 --> 00:36:58,618
拿上来
...and true jesters!

425
00:36:59,335 --> 00:37:02,156
快点
Bring it on! Now!

426
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:16,987
今晚我们准备了新点子
Tonight, a new act for your...

427
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:20,047
叫做巨蛋大屠杀
...personal amazement. We call it Massacre under the Big Top.

428
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:25,662
请注意场中可爱的大圆球
Let us direct your attention to the ring.

429
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:31,435
其中装了两百管TNT炸药
lnside this harmless-looking orb are two... ...that's two hundred sticks of TNT.

430
00:37:31,435 --> 00:37:37,924
遥控引爆信管就在我手中
And in our innocent hand... ...a radio detonator.

431
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,944
你到底要怎样？
What do you want?

432
00:37:39,944 --> 00:37:41,612
要怎样？市长先生？
Want, Mr. Mayor?

433
00:37:41,612 --> 00:37:43,614
我只要一个人-蝙蝠侠
One simple thing: Batman.

434
00:37:43,614 --> 00:37:45,284
我要他肝脑涂地，血流五步
Bruised, broken, bleeding...

435
00:37:45,284 --> 00:37:47,572
简而言之，要他死！
...in a word: dead!

436
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,288
蝙蝠侠
Batman.

437
00:37:53,592 --> 00:37:55,252
今晚在场的
Who do we have before us?

438
00:37:56,028 --> 00:37:58,864
都是高谭市有头有脸的大人物
Gotham's finest... ...well-to-do...

439
00:37:58,864 --> 00:38:02,334
一定有人知道蝙蝠侠是谁
...influential. Surely one of you knows who Batman is.

440
00:38:02,334 --> 00:38:06,224
搞不好蝙蝠侠就在你们之中
Hell, odds are one of you pasty-faced twits is Batman!

441
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:09,835
给你们两分钟
You have two minutes.

442
00:38:15,715 --> 00:38:19,428
双面人！我就是蝙蝠侠
Harvey! l'm Batman!

443
00:38:38,472 --> 00:38:39,540
我们来阻止他们
We can stop them.

444
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,875
快上去
Go out on the rigging.

445
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:41,906
小心
Be careful.

446
00:38:41,942 --> 00:38:42,951
放心！
Don't worry.

447
00:39:01,229 --> 00:39:03,068
上工了，小朋友们！
Go to work, boys!

448
00:39:24,954 --> 00:39:27,066
今天真是个黄道吉日
Our kind of day.

449
00:39:35,866 --> 00:39:37,811
快阻止它爆炸
Reach for it! Stop it!

450
00:39:43,807 --> 00:39:44,779
天啊！
Oh, my God.

451
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,915
谢谢您收容他
lt's good you took him in.

452
00:41:26,915 --> 00:41:28,451
这孩子没有任何亲人了
He hasn't anyone now.

453
00:41:28,451 --> 00:41:30,786
他整天都在写调查报告
He filled out papers all day.

454
00:41:30,786 --> 00:41:32,625
不吃不喝
He hasn't slept or eaten.

455
00:41:44,033 --> 00:41:45,935
欢迎您，葛瑞森主人
Welcome, Master Grayson.

456
00:41:45,935 --> 00:41:47,488
我叫阿福
l'm Alfred.

457
00:41:47,503 --> 00:41:49,033
你好，阿福
How you doing, Al?

458
00:41:50,573 --> 00:41:52,542
您的房间准备好了
There's a room prepared for you.

459
00:41:52,542 --> 00:41:55,318
或者您想先吃点东西
But perhaps you'd like to eat first.

460
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,878
好了，我要闪人了
Okay, l'm out of here.

461
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:02,403
什么？
Excuse me?

462
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:04,788
我骗条子我要住在这里
Telling that cop l'd stay here...

463
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:07,705
免得社工人员找我嗦
...saved me a lot of social service interviews.

464
00:42:08,258 --> 00:42:10,547
谢了，我闪了，再见
So, no offense, but no thanks. See you.

465
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,334
保重了
Take it easy.

466
00:42:24,009 --> 00:42:26,999
你上哪儿？马戏团已经离开了
Where will you go? The circus must be halfway to Metropolis.

467
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:29,702
我要找到双面人
Get a fix on Two-Face.

468
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:31,539
亲手杀了他
Then l'll kill him.

469
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:34,954
杀了双面人不会让你远离痛苦
Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away.

470
00:42:34,954 --> 00:42:36,522
只会越来越糟
lt'll make it worse.

471
00:42:36,522 --> 00:42:39,119
少跟我打屁，拜！
Spare me the sermons, all right?

472
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:42,237
我不用你来说教或同情
l don't need your advice or your charity.

473
00:42:43,596 --> 00:42:45,031
好酷的机车
Nice bike.

474
00:42:45,031 --> 00:42:48,329
你也喜欢重型古董机车吗？
Hang out at a lot of biker bars?

475
00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:51,356
你的油快没了
You're almost on empty.

476
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,172
到车库加满油再走吧
Fill it up in the garage.

477
00:42:53,172 --> 00:42:55,390
方园十哩内可没有加油站
There's no gas station for miles.

478
00:43:03,383 --> 00:43:04,913
加油枪在那儿
Pump's over here.

479
00:43:05,085 --> 00:43:08,383
大哥，这是车库或汽车博物馆
ls this a garage or a car museum, Bruce?

480
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:18,566
一九一七年的哈雷
A 1917 Harley.

481
00:43:18,566 --> 00:43:19,775
是的
Yep.

482
00:43:19,966 --> 00:43:22,937
古典印地安型，完美如新
lndian Classic, fully restored.

483
00:43:22,937 --> 00:43:25,606
这是文森黑骑士型
This is a Vincent Black Knight.

484
00:43:25,606 --> 00:43:27,441
只生产了一百部
They only made 100.

485
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:30,778
其实是一百零一部，我的最爱
A hundred and one, actually. She's my favorite.

486
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:32,513
你竟然有两部
You've got two.

487
00:43:32,513 --> 00:43:34,530
那一部故障了
That one doesn't run.

488
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:37,051
这一部的节流阀堵住了
Throttle sticks on this one.

489
00:43:37,051 --> 00:43:39,153
阿福修车有一套
Alfred's a good mechanic, but...

490
00:43:39,153 --> 00:43:40,823
不过这个工程浩大
...these need a lot of work.

491
00:43:40,823 --> 00:43:43,592
谁能帮我修好它们
Someone were to fix them up...

492
00:43:43,592 --> 00:43:45,359
我就送他一部
...they could keep one.

493
00:43:47,763 --> 00:43:50,230
好了，祝旅程愉快
Anyway... ...have a nice trip.

494
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,447
我想你会一切如意的
You'll land on your feet.

495
00:43:56,505 --> 00:44:00,008
小主人要走了吗？真可惜
ls the young master leaving? Pity.

496
00:44:00,008 --> 00:44:04,908
那我把食物倒掉喂狗了
l'll just toss this away then. Perhaps the dogs are hungry.

497
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,152
嘿，阿福，等等
Hey, Al, wait up.

498
00:44:09,152 --> 00:44:09,638
嘿，阿福，等等
Hey, Al, wait up.

499
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:04,465
主人？
Master Bruce?

500
00:46:09,845 --> 00:46:11,541
和我父母一样
Just like my parents.

501
00:46:12,214 --> 00:46:13,529
悲剧又再重演
lt's happening again.

502
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:16,574
怪物从黑暗中出现
A monster comes out of the night,

503
00:46:16,586 --> 00:46:19,432
我听到尖叫，两声枪响
a scream, two shots.

504
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:21,913
我杀了他们
l killed them.

505
00:46:22,258 --> 00:46:24,293
你说什么？
What did you say?

506
00:46:24,293 --> 00:46:25,661
他杀了他们
He killed them.

507
00:46:25,661 --> 00:46:26,963
双面人
Two-Face.

508
00:46:26,963 --> 00:46:29,633
他杀了那孩子的父母
He slaughtered that boy's parents.

509
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:31,133
不！不！
No, no.

510
00:46:31,133 --> 00:46:34,988
你刚刚说“我杀了他们”
You said, ''l killed them.''

511
00:46:45,949 --> 00:46:47,646
好好照顾那孩子
Take care of the kid.

512
00:46:47,818 --> 00:46:49,063
知道了，主人
Certainly, sir.

513
00:46:57,194 --> 00:47:00,464
要我帮您拿行李吗？小主人
Can l help you settle in, Master Grayson?

514
00:47:00,464 --> 00:47:04,319
不用，我一会儿自己来
No. Thanks, l won't be staying long.

515
00:47:07,205 --> 00:47:09,910
这是知更鸟吗？
ls this a robin?

516
00:47:12,144 --> 00:47:14,680
有一回我哥哥绳子断了
My brother's wire broke once

517
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,549
我荡出去及时抓住了他
and l swung out and grabbed him.

518
00:47:17,549 --> 00:47:19,837
我老爸说我是大英雄
My father said l was his hero.

519
00:47:20,953 --> 00:47:24,287
说我飞得活像只知更鸟
l flew in like a robin.

520
00:47:25,524 --> 00:47:28,828
结果这英雄现在毫无用武之地
Some hero l turned out to be.

521
00:47:28,828 --> 00:47:30,896
你父亲说得对
But your father was right.

522
00:47:30,896 --> 00:47:34,087
你是个英雄，我感觉得到
You are a hero. l can tell.

523
00:47:39,906 --> 00:47:44,842
请把这个丢了，我不需要它了
Throw this away, will you? l won't need it anymore.

524
00:47:46,279 --> 00:47:49,304
我把它放在这里
l think l'll just put it in here.

525
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:57,485
折翼即将复原
Broken wings mend in time.

526
00:47:58,759 --> 00:48:01,962
总有一天你会再度展翅高飞
One day Robin will fly again.

527
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:02,898
我保证
l promise.

528
00:49:25,516 --> 00:49:26,690
我来开
We'll drive.

529
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:02,199
叫“谜语大师”如何？
The Puzzler?

530
00:51:06,489 --> 00:51:08,601
叫“大老千”呢？
The Gamester?

531
00:51:14,398 --> 00:51:16,379
“魔鬼杀手”呢？
Captain Kill?

532
00:51:20,704 --> 00:51:23,030
“谜天大圣”呢？
Question Mark Man?

533
00:51:40,457 --> 00:51:42,439
谢了，太感激了
Thank you. Thank you so much.

534
00:51:56,675 --> 00:52:00,913
怎样都动不了那蝙蝠一根汗毛
The Bat's stubborn refusal to expire...

535
00:52:00,913 --> 00:52:03,096
简直令我抓狂
...is driving us insane!

536
00:52:06,185 --> 00:52:07,774
别烦心了，宝贝
Don't worry, baby.

537
00:52:09,521 --> 00:52:11,774
你马上可以宰了他
You'll kill him soon.

538
00:52:16,295 --> 00:52:20,053
我替你准备了大餐
Besides... ...l made your favorite.

539
00:52:20,267 --> 00:52:24,070
香槟、鲑鱼
Sparkling champagne and... ...yummy poached salmon with little quail eggs and a...

540
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:28,814
鹌鹑蛋
...creamy...

541
00:52:28,814 --> 00:52:30,095
幻想
...dreamy...

542
00:52:30,182 --> 00:52:31,950
还有香喷喷的柠檬蛋酥
...lemon souffle.

543
00:52:32,812 --> 00:52:35,682
我这边的才叫做大餐
No, l made your favorite.

544
00:52:35,682 --> 00:52:37,851
炭烤野猪心
A charred heart of black boar...

545
00:52:37,851 --> 00:52:40,320
野驴肉
...a side of raw donkey meat...

546
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:45,492
还有不加冰的超级够劲烈酒
...and a Sterno and grain alcohol, straight up, baby!

547
00:52:46,594 --> 00:52:47,928
太完美了
Perfect!

548
00:52:47,928 --> 00:52:49,764
女士们，你们把我们宠坏了
Ladies, you spoil us!

549
00:52:49,764 --> 00:52:53,200
我们还没决定先吃那一边
We're of two minds about what to eat first.

550
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,536
什么声音？
What?!

551
00:52:54,536 --> 00:52:56,805
希望你有替我多留一份
l hope you made extra.

552
00:52:56,805 --> 00:52:58,643
你到底是谁？
Who the hell are you?

553
00:52:59,407 --> 00:53:00,866
只是一个朋友
Just a friend.

554
00:53:01,043 --> 00:53:05,491
不过你可以叫我“谜天大圣”
But you can call me......The Riddler.

555
00:53:07,749 --> 00:53:09,584
听起来像是死人名字
l'll call you dead, is more like it!

556
00:53:09,584 --> 00:53:11,921
说，你怎么找到我们？
How did you find us? Talk!

557
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:15,057
我说了你会放了我吗？
But then if l talked what would keep you from slaying me, O Segregated One?

558
00:53:15,057 --> 00:53:20,227
心眼小难怪脸永远好不了
That's never going to heal if you don't stop picking.

559
00:53:21,263 --> 00:53:24,810
我倒要看看你的血是绿色的吗
Let's see if you bleed green.

560
00:53:25,034 --> 00:53:27,774
你想杀的人可不是我
lt's not me you want to kill.

561
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:33,480
取我小命对你们而言太容易了
That's just too easy for someone as powerful as you and... ...you.

562
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:39,385
杀了蝙蝠侠，那才够气派
But Batman... ...there's a challenge.

563
00:53:39,615 --> 00:53:42,719
宰了那只蝙蝠，听起来不赖
Kill the Bat! Sounds like a good idea.

564
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,087
但你想过吗？
But have you thought it through?

565
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:48,359
几发子弹，血溅五步，然后呢
A few bullets, a splash of blood, then what?

566
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:51,296
只是弄脏你的手
Wet hands.

567
00:53:51,296 --> 00:53:54,842
还会染上杀人后的忧郁症
Post-homicidal depression.

568
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:59,865
何不先侮辱他一番
Why not humiliate him first? Yeah.

569
00:53:59,971 --> 00:54:03,908
找出他的弱点，在他最脆弱时
Expose his frailties. Then, when he is at his weakest...

570
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:06,506
给他致命一击
...crush him!

571
00:54:07,812 --> 00:54:11,975
你的左眼正在闪闪发光
l see that... ...sparkle in your left eye.

572
00:54:12,884 --> 00:54:16,359
我可以帮你逮到蝙蝠侠
l can help you get Batman.

573
00:54:18,591 --> 00:54:23,941
不过你得饶了我这条小命
That is, if you'll... ...spare my life for just a few moments.

574
00:54:34,473 --> 00:54:35,481
谢了
Thank you.

575
00:54:36,443 --> 00:54:38,661
我喜欢你的装潢
l love what you've done here.

576
00:54:38,778 --> 00:54:41,067
有后现代主义的风格
Heavy Metal meets House and Garden.

577
00:54:42,848 --> 00:54:43,916
太美了
Beautiful.

578
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:49,271
一边是黑暗、野蛮、颓废
lt's so dark and Gothic and... ...disgustingly decadent.

579
00:54:50,924 --> 00:54:53,913
一边却如此明亮、活泼
Yet so bright and chipper and...

580
00:54:55,228 --> 00:54:56,509
优雅保守
...conservative.

581
00:55:00,767 --> 00:55:03,371
正是你的个性
lt's so you!

582
00:55:03,371 --> 00:55:05,696
完完全全的你
And yet, so you!

583
00:55:07,408 --> 00:55:10,845
很少人能像你一样完美地
Very few people are both a summer and a winter, but...

584
00:55:10,845 --> 00:55:14,558
融合了两种极端的品味
...but you pull it off nicely.

585
00:55:16,552 --> 00:55:18,105
讲重点
What's the point?

586
00:55:19,121 --> 00:55:20,621
有没有人告诉你
Has anyone ever told you

587
00:55:20,621 --> 00:55:24,026
你有严重的乱抓狂毛病
you have a serious impulse-control problem?!

588
00:55:25,294 --> 00:55:28,283
这就是重点
This is the point.

589
00:55:40,143 --> 00:55:44,247
我来示范我是如何找到你的
This is how l found you. Let me demonstrate.

590
00:55:50,153 --> 00:55:51,742
这是你的脑
This is your brain on the Box.

591
00:55:52,589 --> 00:55:54,533
这是小弟我的脑
This is my brain.

592
00:55:54,624 --> 00:55:57,056
有没有人还要玩吗？
Does anyone else feel like a fried egg?

593
00:55:57,193 --> 00:55:58,688
我还要再玩
l'll have more.

594
00:55:59,129 --> 00:56:02,011
没问题，不过要收费
There's more. But only the first one's free.

595
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:04,934
我们来谈条件
Here's the bargain:

596
00:56:04,934 --> 00:56:07,670
你帮我找资金来生产这机器
You'll help me steal production capital...

597
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:10,808
我让城市每部电视都装上它
...so l can put a Box on every TV in town...

598
00:56:10,808 --> 00:56:16,013
我就成了高谭市最聪明的生物
...and become Gotham's cleverest carbon-based life form!

599
00:56:16,013 --> 00:56:19,275
为了报答你们...
And in return....

600
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:22,219
你们有听好吗？
ls everybody paying attention?

601
00:56:22,219 --> 00:56:25,122
我会帮你解出世纪之谜
l will help you solve the greatest riddle of all.

602
00:56:25,122 --> 00:56:27,234
有史以来最大的谜
The mother of all riddles:

603
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:32,075
蝙蝠侠是何方神圣
Who is... ...Batman?

604
00:56:33,865 --> 00:56:36,201
你擅闯我秘密基地
You broke into our hideout.

605
00:56:36,201 --> 00:56:38,870
破坏这块净土的圣洁
You violated the sanctity of our lair.

606
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:41,707
本该把你碎尸万段
We should crush your bones into powder.

607
00:56:41,707 --> 00:56:43,976
不过看在你点子不错的份上
But you pose an interesting proposition.

608
00:56:43,976 --> 00:56:46,311
丢铜板决定，大头朝上放了你
Therefore, heads, we accept,

609
00:56:46,311 --> 00:56:48,130
字朝上你就认命受死吧
and tails, we blow your damn head off.

610
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,862
这一颗不错
Here's a good one.

611
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:07,625
不对不对
No, no, no!

612
00:57:07,834 --> 00:57:09,778
这一颗更好
There is a good one.

613
00:57:11,405 --> 00:57:13,730
放着就好，我来晾
-Leave that. l'll attend to it.

614
00:57:13,807 --> 00:57:15,990
我可不习惯被人伺候
-l'm not used to being waited on.

615
00:57:40,936 --> 00:57:42,137
不要开枪
Don't shoot me!

616
00:57:42,137 --> 00:57:44,948
发什么楞，拿来
Don't eyeball me! Give me that!

617
00:57:48,143 --> 00:57:50,879
双面人，教我怎么揍人
Two-Face, show me how to punch a guy!

618
00:57:50,879 --> 00:57:54,049
简单得很，握拳、往后拉
lt's dead simple, my boy. Ball up your fist, reach back...

619
00:57:54,049 --> 00:57:55,602
再用力打出去
...and assert yourself.

620
00:57:57,353 --> 00:57:59,465
有意思，我试试
That looks fun. Let me try.

621
00:58:00,356 --> 00:58:03,939
握拳、往后拉，用力打出去
Ball up the fist, reach way back ...assert yourself.

622
00:58:08,531 --> 00:58:11,307
十万零两百二十
One hundred thousand, two hundred and twenty.

623
00:58:11,934 --> 00:58:13,986
十万零...
One hundred and....

624
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:15,386
又数乱了
l lost count!

625
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:21,645
昨夜绿衣抢匪再度犯案
Last night another robbery, perpetrated by the green-suited menace...

626
00:58:21,645 --> 00:58:23,747
数百万元钻石遭窃
...resulting in millions in diamonds stolen,

627
00:58:23,747 --> 00:58:25,582
蝙蝠侠并未出现
with no sign of Batman.

628
00:58:25,582 --> 00:58:30,220
匪徒作案习惯在现场留下谜语
This new criminal's pattern of marking his crimes with puzzles...

629
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:33,491
市井间以“谜天大圣”称呼之
...has Gothamites calling him The Riddler.

630
00:58:33,491 --> 00:58:37,128
显然他是你和蝙蝠侠的公敌
Apparently, you and Batman have a common enemy.

631
00:58:37,128 --> 00:58:39,702
这是一早送来的新谜语
That was with the morning mail.

632
00:58:41,433 --> 00:58:43,802
八条好汉勇往直前
''The eight of us go forth, not back,

633
00:58:43,802 --> 00:58:45,103
不回头
to protect our king...

634
00:58:45,103 --> 00:58:47,048
一心护主公
''...from attack.''

635
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:48,260
西洋棋的卒子
Chess pawns.

636
00:58:48,373 --> 00:58:49,541
时钟

都是人造的物件
All man-made objects.

639
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:54,728
体积小，重量轻
Small in size, light in weight.

640
00:58:54,913 --> 00:58:56,466
之间有何关联？
What's the connection?

641
00:58:56,615 --> 00:59:00,329
这就是他外号谜天大圣的原因
With all due respect, that's why they call him The Riddler.

642
00:59:03,021 --> 00:59:04,856
有事要我效劳吗？
May l help you?

643
00:59:04,856 --> 00:59:07,492
为什么只有这门上了锁？
Why is this the only locked door?

644
00:59:07,492 --> 00:59:09,327
门后是什么？
What's back there?

645
00:59:09,327 --> 00:59:12,387
主人韦恩死去的太太
Master Wayne's dead wives.

646
00:59:12,665 --> 00:59:15,405
那是放银器的柜子
The silver closet. On your way.

647
00:59:18,504 --> 00:59:22,075
现在各位可以体验伟大的科技
Now, you can be part of the action!

648
00:59:22,075 --> 00:59:24,478
尼格玛科技集团让您在家中
Nygma Tech brings the joy of 3-D

649
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,731
享受3D立体声光娱乐
entertainment into your home!

650
00:59:27,447 --> 00:59:32,527
各位，我们的理想
Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you... ...my vision.

651
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,790
这魔幻宝盒享誉全美
The Box in every home in America...

652
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:39,115
即将风行全世界
...and one day, the world!

653
00:59:39,259 --> 00:59:42,297
本地消息，艾德华的魔幻宝盒
ln local news, Edward Nygma's 3-D Box...

654
00:59:42,297 --> 00:59:44,965
已在本市掀起购买热潮

655
00:59:44,965 --> 00:59:49,636
昨晚所有家电行被抢购一空
Rioting occurred last night at electronic stores that were sold out.

656
00:59:49,636 --> 00:59:53,112
几乎全市每户皆有安装
There is hardly a home without the Nygma Tech Box.

657
00:59:53,541 --> 00:59:57,011
评论家认为这是机械化的沉沦
Critics claim the Box turns Gothamites into zombies.

658
00:59:57,011 --> 00:59:59,013
但艾德华本人有不同看法
But Edward Nygma just shrugs.

659
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:01,824
电视发明时，他们也是这么说
''That's what they said when TV was invented.''

660
01:00:44,661 --> 01:00:46,393
小主人
Master Dick!

661
01:00:47,831 --> 01:00:49,384
在这儿
Up here.

662
01:00:50,033 --> 01:00:52,915
没什么事，小主人
Just checking, young sir.

663
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:26,408
遭非法闯入，注意！
lntruder alert. lntruder alert.

664
01:01:51,898 --> 01:01:55,269
我有东西给你，在桌上
l have something for you. lt's on the table.

665
01:01:55,269 --> 01:01:57,487
希望你会喜欢
l hope you like it.

666
01:02:07,848 --> 01:02:10,951
这是出于专业上的直觉
Call it clinical intuition.

667
01:02:10,951 --> 01:02:14,142
你的梦境需要改变一下
l thought your dreams needed changing.

668
01:02:16,258 --> 01:02:19,361
我父母在我眼前遭人杀害
My parents were murdered before me...

669
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:21,934
当时我只是个孩子
...when l was a kid.

670
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:28,670
详细经过我记不太清楚
l don't... ...remember a lot of what happened, but...

671
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:33,908
但在梦境中却历历在目
...what l do comes to me in my dreams. Flashes.

672
01:02:34,277 --> 01:02:38,281
最近梦中却出现一些新的内容
There's a new element now though, l haven't seen before.

673
01:02:38,281 --> 01:02:41,507
是一本红皮册子
lt's a red leather book.

674
01:02:41,784 --> 01:02:44,145
新的梦境
Something else....

675
01:02:44,487 --> 01:02:48,124
甚至连我醒时都常会作这些梦
My dreams come to me when l'm awake now.

676
01:02:48,124 --> 01:02:51,594
布鲁斯，这是你压抑下的记忆
Bruce, you're describing repressed memories.

677
01:02:51,594 --> 01:02:57,751
记忆深处的痛苦会试着被释放
lmages of a forgotten pain that's trying to surface.

678
01:02:58,968 --> 01:03:00,213
我马上回来
l'll be right back.

679
01:03:13,484 --> 01:03:16,959
蝙蝠侠法外锄奸令人争议


680
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:22,226
精神分裂诊断书
ls there an aspect of your

681
01:03:22,226 --> 01:03:23,886
关于你父母之死
parents' death you haven't faced?

682
01:03:23,895 --> 01:03:25,863
是否有什么你不敢面对的
You were so young

683
01:03:25,863 --> 01:03:28,010
当时你还很小
when it happened.

684
01:03:28,299 --> 01:03:31,940
也许我该让你专心研究蝙蝠侠
Maybe l should leave you two alone.

685
01:03:32,037 --> 01:03:36,520
这该不会只是把公事带回家吧
This goes way beyond taking your work home, doesn't it?

686
01:03:38,577 --> 01:03:39,964
好吧
All right.

687
01:03:41,947 --> 01:03:43,999
我承认他够刺激
l think he's fascinating.

688
01:03:44,316 --> 01:03:46,085
心理学角度上的
Clinically.

689
01:03:46,085 --> 01:03:48,446
为什么一个男人会这么做？
Why does a man do this?

690
01:03:48,921 --> 01:03:51,190
仿佛受到诅咒般在赎罪
lt's as if he's cursed to pay penance.

691
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:53,258
他到底犯了什么错
What crime could he have committed to

692
01:03:53,258 --> 01:03:57,163
注定要在夜间出没受惩罚
deserve a life of nightly torture?

693
01:03:57,163 --> 01:04:02,516
只是专业上的好奇吗？慈丝？
lt's more than just... ...professional interest, isn't it, Chase?

694
01:04:03,336 --> 01:04:05,388
你在吃醋吗？
Bruce, are you jealous?

695
01:04:05,939 --> 01:04:11,704
不，我无法吃蝙蝠侠的醋
No. l can't be jealous of Batman.

696
01:04:11,845 --> 01:04:16,329
我想亲近你，你却拒人千里
l want to be close, but you won't let me near.

697
01:04:16,517 --> 01:04:20,020
有什么不想让我知道的吗？
What are you protecting me from?

698
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:22,456
想知道原因吗？
Do you want to know me?

699
01:04:22,456 --> 01:04:24,887
你知道我是谁吗？
Do you want to know who l am?

700
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:30,986
我想我们都有两种面貌
l guess... ...we're all two people.

701
01:04:32,133 --> 01:04:36,704
外表所呈现的 和内心真实的自我
One daylight, and the one we keep in shadow.

702
01:04:36,704 --> 01:04:41,206
愤怒、暴力、激情
Rage... ...violence... ...passion.

703
01:04:45,647 --> 01:04:46,750
对不起
Excuse me.

704
01:04:48,716 --> 01:04:49,684
我正在忙
l'm busy.

705
01:04:49,684 --> 01:04:54,389
抱歉打扰你，小主人惹麻烦了
l'm sorry to bother you. l have some distressing news about Dick.

706
01:04:54,389 --> 01:04:55,991
他还好吧？
ls he okay?

707
01:04:55,991 --> 01:04:58,696
他出门了
l'm afraid Master Dick has gone traveling.

708
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:01,163
离家出走吗？
He ran away?

709
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:04,467
事实上，他把车开走了
Actually, he took the car.

710
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:06,469
把积架开走吗？
He boosted the Jag?

711
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:08,071
不是那部积架
Not the Jaguar.

712
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:09,572
另一部车
The other car.

713
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:10,907
班特利吗？
Bentley? No, sir.

714
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:14,976
不，主人，是“另外”一部车
The other car.

715
01:05:45,043 --> 01:05:48,791
小妞们，要去兜兜风吗？
Go for a little ride in my love machine, babies?

716
01:05:53,551 --> 01:05:55,054
是蝙蝠侠
lt's Batman!

717
01:05:55,054 --> 01:05:57,521
快开门，蝙蝠侠
Open up, Batman.

718
01:05:58,756 --> 01:06:00,825
等等，他不是蝙蝠侠
Wait! That's not Batman!

719
01:06:00,825 --> 01:06:02,393
你说什么？
What do you mean?

720
01:06:02,393 --> 01:06:04,789
他是蝙蝠弟弟
That's Batboy!

721
01:06:05,064 --> 01:06:07,080
不是蝙蝠侠本人嘛
lt ain't the Bat!

722
01:06:29,756 --> 01:06:31,144
放了她
Let her go!

723
01:06:38,865 --> 01:06:41,134
你是什么东西？
Who the hell are you?

724
01:06:41,134 --> 01:06:43,387
在下蝙蝠侠
l'm Batman.

725
01:06:44,772 --> 01:06:48,106
我忘了穿蝙蝠装，不行吗？
l forgot my suit, all right?

726
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:28,444
快走
Come on, run!

727
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:31,668
蝙蝠侠不和女士吻别吗？
Doesn't Batman ever kiss the girl?

728
01:07:33,456 --> 01:07:34,487
走！
Go!

729
01:07:34,657 --> 01:07:36,659
谢了，你救了我
Thanks, you saved my life!

730
01:07:36,659 --> 01:07:40,728
看来我天生是当超级英雄的料
l could definitely get into this superhero gig.

731
01:08:03,355 --> 01:08:05,015
蝙蝠侠来了！
Batman!

732
01:08:18,403 --> 01:08:19,904
你可恶！
Bastard!

733
01:08:19,904 --> 01:08:21,907
我家人成了你的替死鬼
lt should've been you!

734
01:08:21,907 --> 01:08:25,177
当时你向双面人承认是你
lf you had told Two-Face who you were at the circus...

735
01:08:25,177 --> 01:08:28,202
他们就都不会死了
...they'd still be alive!

736
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:33,819
若能以布鲁斯韦恩的命来交换
lf Bruce Wayne could've given his life for your family

737
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:35,207
他会乐意的
he would have.

738
01:08:40,893 --> 01:08:44,571
我现在一心只想杀双面人
All l can think about every day is getting Two-Face.

739
01:08:45,465 --> 01:08:47,861
他毁了我的一生
He took my whole life.

740
01:08:49,503 --> 01:08:51,605
今晚我在干架时
When l was out there tonight...

741
01:08:51,605 --> 01:08:54,241
都把对手当成是他
...l imagined it was him l was fighting...

742
01:08:54,241 --> 01:08:57,231
连我在捶你时也一样
...even when l was fighting you...

743
01:08:57,278 --> 01:09:00,232
浑然忘了肉体的痛苦
...and the pain went away.

744
01:09:00,281 --> 01:09:01,977
你了解吗？
Do you understand?

745
01:09:01,982 --> 01:09:03,642
我了解
Yes, l do.

746
01:09:03,651 --> 01:09:07,755
很好，你一定得帮我找到他
Good. You must help me find him.

747
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:08,949
那以后
When we do...

748
01:09:09,424 --> 01:09:11,820
我要亲手宰了他
...l'm the one who kills him.

749
01:09:13,261 --> 01:09:16,531
这是你一生的目标吗？
So, you're willing to take a life?

750
01:09:16,531 --> 01:09:19,793
是的，亲手杀了双面人
As long as it's Two-Face.

751
01:09:21,069 --> 01:09:24,747
然后事情就像这样
Then it will happen this way:

752
01:09:24,773 --> 01:09:30,979
你杀了双面人，痛苦却未远离
you make the kill. And your pain doesn't die with Harvey, it grows.

753
01:09:30,979 --> 01:09:33,552
反而与日俱增
So you run into the night to find another face, and another...

754
01:09:34,015 --> 01:09:37,886
夜复一夜，你不断借杀伐解脱
...and another...

755
01:09:37,886 --> 01:09:40,255
直到有一天你醒来
...until one terrible morning you wake up and realize...

756
01:09:40,255 --> 01:09:44,393
你将发现复仇成了生命的全部
...that revenge has become your whole life...

757
01:09:44,393 --> 01:09:47,497
而你却无法自拔
...and you won't know why.

758
01:09:47,497 --> 01:09:49,532
你不了解
You can't understand.

759
01:09:49,532 --> 01:09:53,402
你家人又没有被疯子杀掉
Your family wasn't killed by a maniac.

760
01:09:53,402 --> 01:09:56,239
他们就是这么死的
Yes, they were.

761
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:58,108
我们同痛相怜
We're the same.

762
01:09:58,108 --> 01:10:00,343
既然如此，请帮助我，训练我
lf we're the same, help me. Train me,

763
01:10:00,343 --> 01:10:02,395
我来做你的最佳拍档
let me be your partner.

764
01:10:04,615 --> 01:10:05,718
不行
No.

765
01:10:06,483 --> 01:10:10,253
你仍有选择余地
l can't. You still have a choice.

766
01:10:11,121 --> 01:10:15,190
不管怎样，反正我跟定你了！
Look, Bruce... ...l'm a part of this, like it or not.

767
01:10:33,111 --> 01:10:36,948
今晚本市社交界的盛会
Tonight all of Gotham society has turned out for Edward Nygma's...

768
01:10:36,948 --> 01:10:40,661
艾德华将发表魔幻宝盒第二代
...gala unveiling of his New lmproved Box.

769
01:10:41,853 --> 01:10:43,155
谢了，阿福
Thanks, Al.

770
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:44,258
不客气
My pleasure, sir.

771
01:10:44,289 --> 01:10:46,092
名人们将畅饮狂舞
They'll be dining and dancing the night away...

772
01:10:46,092 --> 01:10:50,125
享受高谭亚都饭店的顶楼夜色
...on the glamorous roof of the Ritz Gotham.

773
01:11:00,573 --> 01:11:04,677
成了杂志的封面人物有何感想
What's it like to have your face on the cover of every magazine?

774
01:11:06,013 --> 01:11:09,816
身为本市最有身价的单身汉
Edward, how does it feel to be the city's newest,

775
01:11:09,816 --> 01:11:11,918
你感觉如何？
most eligible bachelor?

776
01:11:11,918 --> 01:11:14,421
想必十分新鲜
Gotham must know!

777
01:11:14,421 --> 01:11:16,890
布鲁斯韦恩来了
There's Bruce Wayne!

778
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:18,657
老布！
Brucie!

779
01:11:19,159 --> 01:11:21,899
天啊！他太帅了
Oh, Eddie, he is too cute!

780
01:11:22,896 --> 01:11:25,300
你怎么没他那么帅
How come you don't look so good in that suit?

781
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:28,268
闭嘴，你有任务在身
Shut up. You're here to work!

782
01:11:28,268 --> 01:11:29,436
我的痣怎么样
How's my mole?

783
01:11:29,436 --> 01:11:30,337
很好
Fine.

784
01:11:30,338 --> 01:11:34,107
谣传艾德华有意收购韦恩集团
What about rumors of a Nygma Tech takeover of Wayne Enterprises?

785
01:11:34,107 --> 01:11:37,378
尼格玛股票是韦恩集团的两倍
Nygma Tech stock is outselling Wayne Enterprises 2 to 1 .

786
01:11:37,378 --> 01:11:40,083
布鲁斯，你的公司过气了吗？
Are you yesterday's news, Bruce?

787
01:11:41,549 --> 01:11:43,518
布鲁斯老公公
Bruce, old man.

788
01:11:43,518 --> 01:11:46,754
新闻界想知道被形容成
The press wonders what it's like to be outsold, outclassed, out-coiffed and...

789
01:11:46,754 --> 01:11:51,831
落伍、过气、明日黄花的感觉
...generally outdone in every way.

790
01:11:52,595 --> 01:11:54,997
艾德华，恭喜了
Hello, Edward. Congratulations.

791
01:11:54,997 --> 01:11:58,234
派对真热闹，好看的西装
Great party. Nice suit.

792
01:11:58,234 --> 01:11:59,763
会讲话
Wit. Good.

793
01:12:00,169 --> 01:12:01,637
阁下是？
And you are?

794
01:12:01,637 --> 01:12:03,511
梅慈丝
Chase.

795
01:12:04,406 --> 01:12:06,767
你一定很难追求
And what a grand pursuit you must be.

796
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,482
我是布鲁斯韦恩，小姐是？
l'm Bruce Wayne, Miss...?

797
01:12:13,482 --> 01:12:16,151
叫我什么都可以
You can call me anything you want.

798
01:12:17,754 --> 01:12:21,525
各位，这是我们的大未来
Ladies and gentlemen... ...the future!

799
01:12:21,525 --> 01:12:22,893
第二代魔幻宝盒
My New lmproved Box offers

800
01:12:22,893 --> 01:12:26,747
让各位量身打造你们的幻想
fully-interactive holographic fantasies.

801
01:12:46,484 --> 01:12:50,221
艾德华，你真是个天才
Edward, you're dashing and a genius.

802
01:12:50,221 --> 01:12:53,068
你怎么做到的？
How do you create these images, hon?

803
01:12:53,257 --> 01:12:56,768
这是我的小秘密，不告诉你
That, my dear, is my little secret.

804
01:13:03,435 --> 01:13:05,637
量身打造幻想
Fully-interactive holographs.

805
01:13:05,637 --> 01:13:09,074
用高频率载波发射入大脑
Only a high-frequency carrier wave, beamed into the brain...

806
01:13:09,074 --> 01:13:11,143
如此而已
...could create such images.

807
01:13:11,143 --> 01:13:15,447
你后悔了吧，输了就要服气
And you wish you thought of it. Don't be a sore loser.

808
01:13:15,447 --> 01:13:18,223
进去呀，试试嘛
Step inside. Give it a try.

809
01:13:20,086 --> 01:13:23,388
若你能制造出脑中幻象
lf you can introduce images into the mind, what stops you from...

810
01:13:23,388 --> 01:13:28,128
那探知他人思想也是轻而易举
...extracting images out of the mind?

811
01:13:28,128 --> 01:13:31,876
不敢去试，就直说吧！
Too timid to try my machine? Just say so.

812
01:13:34,401 --> 01:13:37,105
可以请你跳支舞吗？
Shall we dance?

813
01:13:57,158 --> 01:14:00,983
小坏蛋，你在找什么
Naughty, naughty. Looking for something?

814
01:14:01,328 --> 01:14:05,291
我很好奇怎么把机器关掉
l was just wondering how you turn it off.

815
01:14:07,639 --> 01:14:08,778
好
Clever.

816
01:14:09,805 --> 01:14:10,836
谢谢
Thanks.

817
01:14:10,839 --> 01:14:12,227
不客气
My pleasure.

818
01:14:41,704 --> 01:14:44,242
晚安，韦恩先生
Good evening, Mr. Wayne.

819
01:14:45,242 --> 01:14:52,103
放轻松，告诉我你的梦境
Relax. Tell me your... ...dreams.

820
01:14:54,051 --> 01:14:58,013
告诉我你的幻想
Tell me... ...your fantasies.

821
01:14:58,756 --> 01:15:03,311
告诉我你心底的秘密
Tell me your secrets.

822
01:15:03,327 --> 01:15:09,163
告诉我你内心深藏的
Tell me... ...your deepest... ...darkest...

823
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:10,996
恐惧
...fears.

824
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:43,569
大家不要紧张
Relax, folks!

825
01:15:43,569 --> 01:15:46,473
这是很简单落后的抢劫
lt's only an old-fashioned low-tech stick-up!

826
01:15:46,473 --> 01:15:49,142
我们对太复杂的东西没兴趣
We're interested in the basics!

827
01:15:49,142 --> 01:15:52,246
现金、珠宝、大哥大都交出来
Cash, jewelry, cellular telephones.

828
01:15:52,246 --> 01:15:55,507
乖乖交出来，大家都会没事
Hand them over nice and quietly, and no one will be hurt!

829
01:16:00,854 --> 01:16:02,728
出事了，阿福
Emergency, Alfred.

830
01:16:03,157 --> 01:16:04,615
知道了，主人
Yes, sir.

831
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:09,784
大家冷静，别慌
Be calm, everybody! Just stay calm!

832
01:16:09,894 --> 01:16:11,447
很抱歉!
Excuse me!

833
01:16:14,702 --> 01:16:18,606
你把我派对弄砸了，你有病吗
You're ruining my big party! Are you insane?!

834
01:16:18,606 --> 01:16:21,342
我们等你抓蝙蝠侠快不耐烦了
We're sick of waiting for you to deliver Batman.

835
01:16:21,342 --> 01:16:23,344
要有耐心，大哥
Patience, O Bifurcated One.

836
01:16:23,344 --> 01:16:25,447
去他的耐心，我们要他死
Patience, hell, we want him dead!

837
01:16:25,447 --> 01:16:28,049
要蝙蝠侠出现最简单的方法
And nothing brings out the Batman

838
01:16:28,049 --> 01:16:29,751
就是杀几个人
like a little murder and mayhem!

839
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:31,620
你该问问我的意见
You could have let me in on the caper.

840
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:34,322
我们可以好好计划一下
We could have organized it,

841
01:16:34,322 --> 01:16:37,204
搞不好还可以卖个电影版权
planned it pre-sold the movie rights!

842
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:51,474
你的出场方式还不赖
Your entrance was good,

843
01:16:51,474 --> 01:16:52,754
不过他的更好
his was better.

844
01:17:00,851 --> 01:17:02,219
差别何在？
The difference?

845
01:17:02,219 --> 01:17:04,271
他秀酷，你秀斗
Showmanship!

846
01:17:10,994 --> 01:17:12,488
有麻烦了，阿福
Emergency, Alfred.

847
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:14,357
是的 先生 
Oh, sir....

848
01:17:14,598 --> 01:17:17,587
我看我大概会被炒鱿鱼
l could be fired for this.

849
01:17:17,769 --> 01:17:19,750
准备回家吃老米饭了
l'll go back to Buckingham Palace.

850
01:17:32,417 --> 01:17:34,705
好了，进行第二阶段
All right, boys! Phase Two!

851
01:17:38,923 --> 01:17:40,999
午夜，我家见
My place, midnight.

852
01:18:44,725 --> 01:18:45,900
瓦斯危险


853
01:18:52,868 --> 01:18:54,920
完美的杀人工具
Nothing like a bad case of gas!

854
01:19:27,937 --> 01:19:30,369
你为什么老是死不了
Why can't you just die?!

855
01:20:22,745 --> 01:20:23,919

Hi.

856
01:20:24,497 --> 01:20:25,778
老兄


857
01:20:30,803 --> 01:20:32,535
你在干嘛？
What were you doing?!

858
01:20:32,538 --> 01:20:35,442
你怎么这么不知好歹？
You got a real gratitude problem, you know that?

859
01:20:35,442 --> 01:20:36,777
给我个名字
l need a name.

860
01:20:36,777 --> 01:20:38,879
蝙蝠男孩？夜间游侠？
Batboy? Knight Wing?

861
01:20:38,879 --> 01:20:40,981
有没有酷一点的名号？
What's a good sidekick name?

862
01:20:40,981 --> 01:20:43,484
大学生，狄克葛瑞森
''Dick Grayson, college student.''

863
01:20:43,484 --> 01:20:46,387
去你的，我救你一命，你欠我
Screw you! l saved your life. You owe me.

864
01:20:46,387 --> 01:20:49,123
你这样下去总有一天会送命
You're going to get yourself killed.

865
01:20:49,123 --> 01:20:50,792
我是你的新拍档
l'm your new partner.

866
01:20:50,792 --> 01:20:51,759
不行
No!

867
01:20:51,759 --> 01:20:53,727
你去哪儿我都盯着你
Whenever you go out at night, l'll be watching.

868
01:20:53,727 --> 01:20:56,631
蝙蝠侠去哪儿，我也跟着去
Where Batman goes, l'll go.

869
01:20:56,631 --> 01:20:59,300
你如何阻止我
How will you stop me?

870
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,067
我会阻止你的
l can stop you.

871
01:21:05,574 --> 01:21:09,148
把这个挂在蝙蝠装旁边
Hang this next to the Batsuit... ...where it belongs.

872
01:21:13,648 --> 01:21:16,281
你在暗中鼓励他
You're encouraging him.

873
01:21:16,952 --> 01:21:19,054
充满复仇怒火的年轻人
Young men with a mind for revenge

874
01:21:19,054 --> 01:21:20,789
需要一点鼓励
need little encouragement.

875
01:21:20,789 --> 01:21:22,698
他们需要的是引导
They need guidance.

876
01:21:24,093 --> 01:21:28,921
你该清楚这一路你怎么走过来
You, above all, should know the consequences of the life you choose.

877
01:21:36,106 --> 01:21:39,742
连慈丝都说蝙蝠侠是受了诅咒
Even Chase calls being Batman a curse.

878
01:21:39,742 --> 01:21:42,316
也许她和你会来电
Perhaps the lady's just what the doctor ordered.

879
01:21:42,378 --> 01:21:44,395
她才貌兼备
She seems lovely and wise.

880
01:21:45,548 --> 01:21:47,837
我从未恋爱过
l've never been in love before.

881
01:21:48,418 --> 01:21:53,067
去找她，向她表白
Go to her. Tell her how you feel.

882
01:21:53,357 --> 01:21:56,260
她喜欢蝙蝠侠，不是我布鲁斯
She wants Batman, not Bruce Wayne.

883
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:58,857
何不让她来决定
Let her decide.

884
01:22:52,019 --> 01:22:57,273
抱歉，真令人难以相信
l'm sorry. l can't believe this.

885
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:01,795
从我第一次见你就期待此刻
l've imagined this moment since l first saw you.

886
01:23:01,795 --> 01:23:09,055
你的眼，你的唇，你的身体
Your eyes... ...your lips. Your body.

887
01:23:10,605 --> 01:23:14,175
现在你近在眼前
And now l have you and...

888
01:23:14,175 --> 01:23:18,552
而我却想着另一个人
...l'm wishing you were somebody else.

889
01:23:22,216 --> 01:23:25,028
我想我该长大了
l guess a girl has to grow up sometime.

890
01:23:27,021 --> 01:23:35,928
我爱上了一个人，不是你
l've met someone. He's not you.

891
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:41,661
希望你能谅解
l hope you can understand.

892
01:23:45,741 --> 01:23:47,959
我完全了解
l understand.

893
01:23:52,286 --> 01:23:53,531
好吧 
Well....

894
01:24:06,796 --> 01:24:09,299
蝙蝠侠地道死里逃生


895
01:24:15,805 --> 01:24:17,917
我跟你一样难过
That's just what l said.

896
01:24:18,708 --> 01:24:20,962
有个点子让我们乐一乐
Then l taught my doggie a new trick:

897
01:24:21,811 --> 01:24:23,270
如何透视人心
how to map the human mind.

898
01:24:23,948 --> 01:24:26,083
想瞧瞧布鲁斯韦恩在想什么吗
Would you like to see what Bruce Wayne has in his head?

899
01:24:26,083 --> 01:24:28,895
尼氏科技档案，扫瞄韦恩档案


900
01:24:41,533 --> 01:24:42,778
猜猜看
Riddle me this:

901
01:24:43,969 --> 01:24:48,371
什么样的人脑中想着蝙蝠？
What kind of man... ...has bats on the brain?

902
01:24:51,877 --> 01:24:53,879
说吧，你来说
-Go ahead. You can say it.

903
01:24:53,879 --> 01:24:55,433
你是个天才
-You're a genius.

904
01:24:55,481 --> 01:24:56,939
奥，我受不了
Oh, stop.

905
01:25:00,219 --> 01:25:04,181
从今天起，蝙蝠侠永远消失了
So, from this day on... ...Batman is no more.

906
01:25:06,526 --> 01:25:07,827
你不能撒手不管
You can't just quit.

907
01:25:07,827 --> 01:25:09,072
邪恶份子仍在猖狂
There's monsters out there.

908
01:25:09,095 --> 01:25:11,112
蝙蝠侠有责任济弱扶倾
Batman has to protect the innocent.

909
01:25:11,564 --> 01:25:13,533
我已花了一辈子的时间
l've dedicated my life to helping strangers l've never met.

910
01:25:13,533 --> 01:25:17,612
去帮助素昧平生的人
Faces l've never seen.

911
01:25:17,838 --> 01:25:19,048
好
Well...

912
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:21,378
我做得太多了
...the innocent aren't faceless anymore.

913
01:25:22,942 --> 01:25:25,683
你无权要我照你意思过生活
You can't tell me what to do with the rest of my life.

914
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:29,249
我老爸说人有权决定生活目标
My dad told me that every man goes his own way.

915
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:31,719
我的生活目标就是双面人
My way goes to Two-Face.

916
01:25:31,719 --> 01:25:33,937
你一定要帮我
You must help me.

917
01:25:34,188 --> 01:25:37,491
你就算找到双面人杀了他
And if you do find Harvey... ...and then kill him...

918
01:25:37,491 --> 01:25:39,223
然后呢？
...what next?

919
01:25:42,863 --> 01:25:44,393
完全正确
Exactly.

920
01:25:44,933 --> 01:25:48,408
然后就像我一样孤独
Then you'd be alone, like me.

921
01:25:50,038 --> 01:25:52,743
忘了这些无谓的仇恨吧
No, you must let this go.

922
01:25:52,774 --> 01:25:54,576
听我的话，我是你朋友
Listen to me, l'm your friend.

923
01:25:54,576 --> 01:25:57,245
我不需要朋友，我要一个拍档
l don't need a friend, l need a partner.

924
01:25:57,245 --> 01:26:00,282
双面人要付出代价
Two-Face has got to pay.

925
01:26:00,282 --> 01:26:01,942
求求你
Please.

926
01:26:03,552 --> 01:26:05,921
慈丝来吃晚饭
Chase is coming for dinner. l'm going to tell her...

927
01:26:05,921 --> 01:26:09,196
我会把一切都告诉她
...everything.

928
01:26:11,494 --> 01:26:13,368
上去吧，我们再谈
Come upstairs. We'll talk.

929
01:26:28,879 --> 01:26:30,089
晚安
-Good evening.

930
01:26:30,213 --> 01:26:31,387
晚安
-Good evening.

931
01:26:31,615 --> 01:26:33,169
万圣节快乐
Happy Halloween.

932
01:26:33,183 --> 01:26:34,571
万圣节快乐
Happy Halloween to you.

933
01:27:09,788 --> 01:27:11,423
我今晚请你来
l asked you here tonight because

934
01:27:11,423 --> 01:27:14,726
是有些事想告诉你
there's something l wanted to tell you.

935
01:27:14,726 --> 01:27:17,497
我也有些话想跟你讲
l wanted to tell you something too.

936
01:27:17,497 --> 01:27:19,441
是这样的...
What l wanted--

937
01:27:20,166 --> 01:27:22,277
没关系，你先讲
Go ahead, you first.

938
01:27:26,239 --> 01:27:28,943
给我糖，否则就捣蛋
Trick or treat!

939
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:35,516
我以前一直迷某种类型的男人
All my life l have been... ...attracted to a certain kind of man.

940
01:27:35,516 --> 01:27:37,078
那种痞子型的
The wrong kind.

941
01:27:37,078 --> 01:27:42,279
甚至还靠研究这种人为生
And look what l do for a living.

942
01:27:43,056 --> 01:27:48,264
自从...自从我认识你以后...我
And since... ...since l met you, l...

943
01:27:49,296 --> 01:27:52,879
天啊，我怎么语无伦次
Oh, God. Why am l so nervous?

944
01:28:00,508 --> 01:28:03,711
别吃太多糖，小心吃坏肚子
Don't eat too much tonight or you'll be sick in your beds.

945
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:05,728
万圣节快乐
Happy Halloween!

946
01:28:51,328 --> 01:28:52,644
怎么了？
What's wrong?

947
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:56,711
又来了，那些影像
lt's happening again. Flashes.

948
01:28:57,634 --> 01:28:59,402
我父母的死
My parents' death.

949
01:29:00,070 --> 01:29:02,181
你的记忆又再度浮现
Your memories are trying to surface.

950
01:29:02,674 --> 01:29:04,618
我要告诉你一件事
l want to tell you something.

951
01:29:04,809 --> 01:29:06,945
我没有和任何人说过
Something l've never told anyone.

952
01:29:06,945 --> 01:29:09,861
没关系，我在你身边
lt's all right. lt's all right. l'm here.

953
01:29:16,689 --> 01:29:18,456
我就在这儿
l'm here.

954
01:29:22,628 --> 01:29:24,775
就在替我父母守灵之夜
The night of my parents' wake...

955
01:29:25,097 --> 01:29:28,051
牧师安慰我的话完全没有作用
...the priest's words gave no comfort.

956
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:34,136
就在父亲书桌上
Of course. There, on my father's desk...

957
01:29:34,406 --> 01:29:36,031
有本红色的书
...the red book.

958
01:29:36,342 --> 01:29:37,895
那是他的日记
His journal.

959
01:29:38,077 --> 01:29:39,666
他每天都写
He wrote in it every day.

960
01:29:40,946 --> 01:29:44,659
但从那天起却永远无法继续了
But now he'd never write in it again.

961
01:29:44,718 --> 01:29:47,052
在那一刻，我知道
At that moment l knew...

962
01:29:47,052 --> 01:29:50,563
我的生命有重大转变
...my life would never be the same.

963
01:29:55,161 --> 01:29:57,831
我冲出去，外面狂风暴雨
l raced out into the storm...

964
01:29:57,831 --> 01:30:02,370
我想将一切愤怒痛苦抛诸脑后
...trying to outrun the rage. The pain.

965
01:30:02,370 --> 01:30:05,039
然后我跌了进去
Then l fell.

966
01:30:06,039 --> 01:30:08,091
那是一个很大的洞穴
l fell forever.

967
01:30:09,944 --> 01:30:15,025
那个洞仿佛存在了好几百年
The cave was monstrous. lt must have been there for centuries.

968
01:30:17,451 --> 01:30:23,723
在深远的暗处我看到了...
And there... ...deep in the shadows... ...l saw....

969
01:30:26,294 --> 01:30:29,034
它朝我飞过来
lt was coming toward me.

970
01:30:29,231 --> 01:30:33,679
起初我很害怕，但只有一下子
l was scared at first, but only at first.

971
01:30:33,702 --> 01:30:37,639
那黑暗中的影像让我立定目标
The figure in the dark was my destiny.

972
01:30:37,639 --> 01:30:41,222
它改变了我的一生
lt would change my life forever.

973
01:30:41,743 --> 01:30:43,440
我要用这个影像
l would use its image to strike terror

974
01:30:43,445 --> 01:30:46,381
作为打击邪恶的正义化身
into the hearts of those who did evil.

975
01:30:46,381 --> 01:30:48,083
我发誓绝不让我的悲剧
l would ensure what happened to me

976
01:30:48,083 --> 01:30:50,266
在他人身上重演
would never happen to anyone else.

977
01:30:52,088 --> 01:30:53,856
我要报仇
l would have my revenge.

978
01:30:57,794 --> 01:31:00,367
你想告诉我什么？
What are you trying to tell me?

979
01:31:01,297 --> 01:31:03,480
我就是...
l'm....

980
01:31:38,169 --> 01:31:41,502
给我糖，否则就捣蛋
Twick or tweet!

981
01:31:47,379 --> 01:31:48,909
你上当了！
Trick.

982
01:31:55,488 --> 01:31:57,356
记得计划吧？
Remember the plan?

983
01:31:57,356 --> 01:31:59,502
抓了人就跑
Seize and capture.

984
01:31:59,558 --> 01:32:01,147
留下活口
No killing.

985
01:32:01,327 --> 01:32:02,715
千万别忘了
That goes double for you.

986
01:32:05,632 --> 01:32:08,468
若我是超级大英雄
lf l was a superhero...

987
01:32:08,468 --> 01:32:11,279
该躲在哪儿呢？
...where would l hide?

988
01:32:16,075 --> 01:32:18,258
上帝惩罚我吧！
Spank me.

989
01:32:29,657 --> 01:32:32,539
非法闯入，注意，非法闯入

我会恭迎他大驾光临

那是什么？从哪儿来的？

01:48:40,306 --> 01:48:42,575
今天谜底就会揭晓

1132
01:48:42,575 --> 01:48:48,047
首先欢迎今天的参赛来宾
But first, let's meet our contestants. Behind curtain...

1133
01:48:48,047 --> 01:48:52,733
布幕后的是一号
...number one...

1134
01:48:54,488 --> 01:48:58,687
超级美女梅慈丝医生
...the absolutely fabulous Dr. Chase Meridian!

1135
01:48:58,859 --> 01:49:01,195
她喜欢登山、修指甲...
She enjoys hiking, manicures...

1136
01:49:01,195 --> 01:49:04,778
以及幻想她是布鲁斯的最爱
...and foolishly hopes to be the love of Bruce's life.

1137
01:49:09,237 --> 01:49:12,393
二号参赛者
Number two:

1138
01:49:15,310 --> 01:49:18,213
号称唯一的最佳拍档
Fatman's one and only partner.

1139
01:49:18,213 --> 01:49:20,515
前空中飞人，现为孤儿
This acrobat turned orphan...

1140
01:49:20,515 --> 01:49:22,751
他喜欢看卡通，做白日梦
...likes Saturday morning cartoons and dreams of one day being...

1141
01:49:22,751 --> 01:49:26,985
常幻想和裸体女郎共处
...bare-naked with a girl.

1142
01:49:29,925 --> 01:49:34,551
在参赛下方是我的杰作
And below these contestants... ...my personal favorite:

1143
01:49:34,964 --> 01:49:37,775
海上坟场
...a watery grave.

1144
01:49:38,701 --> 01:49:40,903
只要轻轻碰一下
Just one little touch...

1145
01:49:40,903 --> 01:49:46,072
五秒后他们就成了海鸥佳肴
...and five seconds later these two players are... ...gull feed on the rocks below.

1146
01:49:48,945 --> 01:49:51,899
你无法同时救两个
Not enough time to save them both.

1147
01:49:55,218 --> 01:49:58,188
蝙蝠侠，你要救哪一个？
Which one will it be, Batman?

1148
01:49:58,188 --> 01:49:59,723
布鲁斯的最爱？
Bruce's love?

1149
01:49:59,723 --> 01:50:03,057
还是你的菜鸟拍档？
Or the Dark Knight's junior partner?

1150
01:50:05,162 --> 01:50:08,666
我可能连我自己都救不了
There is no way for me to save them or myself.

1151
01:50:08,666 --> 01:50:11,097
这是个死亡陷阱
lt's all one giant death-trap.

1152
01:50:11,435 --> 01:50:13,060
裁判先生？
Judges?

1153
01:50:13,638 --> 01:50:16,829
抱歉，你的答案不合理
l'm sorry. Your answer must be in the form of a question.

1154
01:50:16,841 --> 01:50:18,466
感谢您的光临
But thanks for playing.

1155
01:50:19,044 --> 01:50:22,305
等等，我有个谜语
Wait! l have a riddle.

1156
01:50:22,446 --> 01:50:27,138
让我猜吗？真的？
For me? Really?

1157
01:50:29,855 --> 01:50:31,278
快告诉我
Tell me.

1158
01:50:34,861 --> 01:50:37,296
有眼睛却看不到
l see without seeing.

1159
01:50:37,296 --> 01:50:41,151
黑夜如同白昼般清晰
To me, darkness is as clear as daylight.

1160
01:50:41,968 --> 01:50:43,735
我是谁？
What am l?

1161
01:50:44,469 --> 01:50:46,343
拜！
Please!

1162
01:50:46,471 --> 01:50:49,609
你跟蝙蝠一样瞎了眼
You're as blind as a bat!

1163
01:50:49,609 --> 01:50:51,103
完全正确
Exactly.

1164
01:51:27,649 --> 01:51:29,143
完了
Bummer!

1165
01:52:33,184 --> 01:52:34,465
谢了
Thanks.

1166
01:52:48,933 --> 01:52:51,637
逞英雄到头来还是一事无成
All those heroics for nothing.

1167
01:52:51,637 --> 01:52:53,539
不猜谜语，不跟你玩了
No more riddles, no more curtains one and two.

1168
01:52:53,539 --> 01:52:56,599
你准备死吧
Just plain curtains!

1169
01:52:57,376 --> 01:52:59,612
你忘了一件事
Aren't you forgetting something?

1170
01:52:59,612 --> 01:53:01,485
你的铜板
Your coin.

1171
01:53:02,615 --> 01:53:05,355
你老是下不了决定
You're always of two minds.

1172
01:53:06,051 --> 01:53:08,377
没错，你说得对
Yes, of course. You're right.

1173
01:53:08,555 --> 01:53:11,558
人常为情绪左右而无法自制
Emotion's always the enemy of justice.

1174
01:53:11,558 --> 01:53:13,669
你真是我的哥儿们
You've always been a good friend.

1175
01:54:00,275 --> 01:54:02,043
为什么？
Why?

1176
01:54:02,444 --> 01:54:06,679
为什么永远杀不了你
Why can't l... ...kill you?

1177
01:54:09,051 --> 01:54:11,198
轩然大波
Too many questions.

1178
01:54:11,687 --> 01:54:13,490
轩然大波
Too many questions.

1179
01:54:13,789 --> 01:54:15,521
可怜的家伙
Poor Edward.

1180
01:54:15,657 --> 01:54:17,983
我一定得救两个
l had to save them both.

1181
01:54:18,194 --> 01:54:21,597
布鲁斯韦恩就是蝙蝠侠
You see, l'm both Bruce Wayne and Batman.

1182
01:54:21,597 --> 01:54:23,599
这不只是我的义务
Not because l have to be.

1183
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:28,011
也是我选择的生活方式
Now... ...because l choose to be.

1184
01:54:46,524 --> 01:54:49,062
阿甘精神病院


1185
01:54:51,028 --> 01:54:54,397
梅医生，谢谢您前来会诊
Thank you for responding to my request for a consultation, Dr. Meridian.

1186
01:54:55,599 --> 01:54:56,840
艾德华尼格玛一直鬼叫鬼喊
Edward Nygma...

1187
01:54:56,840 --> 01:55:02,438
宣称他知道蝙蝠侠的真实身份
...has been screaming for hours that he knows the true identity... ...of Batman.

1188
01:55:16,288 --> 01:55:17,782
艾德华
Edward?

1189
01:55:18,424 --> 01:55:21,184
是谁呀？
Who... ...is it?

我是梅慈丝医生

1191
01:55:27,634 --> 01:55:29,710
记得我吗？
Do you remember me?

1192
01:55:31,770 --> 01:55:34,166
怎么忘得了呢？
How could l forget?

1193
01:55:34,807 --> 01:55:37,477
波顿医生告诉我...
Dr. Burton tells me...

1194
01:55:37,844 --> 01:55:40,798
你知道谁是蝙蝠侠
...you know who Batman is.

1195
01:55:40,981 --> 01:55:45,145
你不说“请”我就不告诉你
l can't tell you if you don't say, ''please.''

1196
01:55:45,218 --> 01:55:47,543
艾德华，请问你
Edward, please.

1197
01:55:47,621 --> 01:55:50,468
谁是蝙蝠侠
Who is Batman?

1198
01:55:51,592 --> 01:55:54,489
就...是...我
l'm... ...Batman.

1199
01:56:20,488 --> 01:56:22,924
你的秘密安全得很
Your secret is safe.

1200
01:56:22,924 --> 01:56:25,894
他百分之百是个狂人
He is definitely a wacko.

1201
01:56:25,894 --> 01:56:27,429
狂人
Wacko.

1202
01:56:27,429 --> 01:56:31,142
这是心理学专有名词吗？
ls that a technical term? Listen...

1203
01:56:34,437 --> 01:56:37,698
我想我不需要这个了
...l won't need this anymore.

1204
01:56:39,909 --> 01:56:44,072
感谢你让我有了新的美梦

1205
01:56:59,496 --> 01:57:01,821
别工作得太晚了

1206
01:57:28,993 --> 01:57:31,282
剧终
The end
