...likes Saturday-morning cartoons
and dreams of one day being...

RIDDLER: A watery grave.

1671
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,238
Just one little touch...

1672
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:12,837
RIDDLER: and five seconds later
these two players are...

Not enough time to save them both.

Oooh!

1677
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:25,795
Which one will it be, Batman?

1678

to save them or myself.

Your coin.

You're always of two minds.

Yes, of course. You're right.
