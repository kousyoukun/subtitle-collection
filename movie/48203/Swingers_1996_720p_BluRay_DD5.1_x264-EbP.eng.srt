1
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:13,764
No way.

2
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:40,515
You're nobody
'til somebody loves you

3
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,721
You're nobody
'til somebody cares

4
00:00:47,897 --> 00:00:53,358
You may be king
You may possess the world

5
00:00:53,436 --> 00:00:55,996
And its gold

6
00:00:56,072 --> 00:00:59,337
But gold won't bring you
happiness

7
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:03,675
When you're growin' old

8
00:01:03,746 --> 00:01:06,078
The world still is the same

9
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,913
You never change it

10
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,319
As sure as the stars

11
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,848
Shine above

12
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:25,663
You're nobody
'til somebody loves you

13
00:01:25,735 --> 00:01:30,934
So find yourself
somebody to love

14
00:02:03,673 --> 00:02:06,107
The world
still is the same

15
00:02:06,175 --> 00:02:10,475
You never change it

16
00:02:10,546 --> 00:02:14,380
As sure as the stars

17
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,318
Shine above

18
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:25,817
But you're nobody
'til somebody loves you

19
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:33,109
So find yourself
somebody to love

20
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:41,553
- Okay, so what if I don't want to give up on her?
- You don't call.

21
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:44,620
- You said I don't call if I wanted to give up on her.
- Right.

22
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,758
- So I don't call either way.
- Right.

23
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,463
- So what's the difference?
- There is no difference right now.

24
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,598
See, Mike, the only difference
between giving up and not giving up...

25
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,302
is if you take her back
when she wants to come back.

26
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,971
But you can't do anything
to make her want to come back.

27
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:03,106
In fact, you can only do stuff
to make her not want to come back.

28
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:07,017
So the only difference is if I forget about
her or just pretend to forget about her.

29
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:09,954
- Right.
- Well, that sucks.

30
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,685
Yeah, it sucks.

31
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:17,059
So it's like a retroactive decision then?
I mean, I could, like, forget about her.

32
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,463
And then when she comes back, make like
I just pretended to forget about her?

33
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:25,100
Right, although probably
more likely the opposite.

34
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,106
What do you mean?

35
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:30,109
I mean, at first you're gonna pretend
to forget about her.

36
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,611
Not call her,
I don't know, whatever.

37
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,943
But then, eventually,
you really will forget about her.

38
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:38,416
- Well, unless she comes back first.
- Mm, see, that's the thing.

39
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:41,386
Somehow they know not to come back
until you really forget.

40
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,717
- There's the rub.
- There's the rub.

41
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:56,133
Look, man, uh, I-I'm sorry we always
talk about the same thing all the time.

42
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:59,536
- Ah, no, it's all right.
- It's just that, you know... It's just you been there, man.

43
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,904
- Don't sweat it.
- Your advice really helps. And I just, I don't know...

44
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,741
You know, Rob, you're the only one
I can talk to about her.

45
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,838
Thanks. Thanks, man.

46
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:15,485
Hello, you have four messages.

47
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,251
Message one.

48
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,418
Hey, gorgeous,
it's, uh, Trent calling.

49
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,690
Look, you gotta get that girl
out of your head. Uh, I hope my...

50
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,527
Message two.

51
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,592
Hey, Mike, uh, if you want
to talk about Michelle, give me...

52
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,035
Message three.

53
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,938
Did she call yet? I'm sure she...
- Message four.

54
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:38,409
Michael, this is Grandma.

55
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,878
We all miss you
back here in New York.

56
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,882
You still haven't told me if you got
that part on the television pro...

57
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:48,284
That was your last message.

58
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:53,459
You have to put things in perspective.

59
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:56,962
- I know, I know.
- She doesn't deserve you.

60
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,964
Thanks. I appreciate that.

61
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,466
There are plenty of fish
in the sea.

62
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,900
Okay, that's great advice.
Thanks a lot. Okay? Bye.

63
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,803
- Life, after all...
- Please, I'm trying to make a phone call.

64
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:10,036
- Are you calling her?
- No. Will you stop? I'm try... Please.

65
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,416
- Hello?
- What's up, Trent?

66
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,578
Hey, we got two parties
tonight. One's for a modeling agency.

67
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,589
- I don't know.
- Listen to me, baby. There's gonna be beautiful babies there.

68
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,421
I... Look, Trent, uh,
I got shit to do tomorrow.

69
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,428
Listen to you. I've got a final callback on
a pilot at 9:00, and I'm going to this thing.

70
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,930
Come on, Mike, you got to get out
with the beautiful babies.

71
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,762
- You can't sit at home thinking about it.
- Not tonight.

72
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,428
Not tonight? Listen to you!
We're gonna have fun tonight.

73
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,938
- We gotta get you out
of that stuffy apartment.

74
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,100
We're gonna spend half the night driving
around the hills looking for this one party,

75
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,610
and you're gonna say it sucks,
and we're all gonna leave,

76
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,613
and then we're gonna go look
for this other party.

77
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,945
But all the parties
and all the bars, they all suck.

78
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,951
I spend half the night talkin' to some
girl who's lookin' around the room...

79
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,113
to see if there's somebody else who's
more important she should be talking to.

80
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,023
And it's like I'm supposed to be all
happy, uh, 'cause she's wearing a backpack.

81
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,891
I... You know, and half of them
are just nasty skanks...

82
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:06,693
who wouldn't be nothing, except they're
surrounded by a bunch of drunken, horny assholes.

83
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,064
I'm gonna tell you something, T.
Are you listening?

84
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:13,162
- Yeah, I'm listening.
- I'm not gonna be one of those assholes, all right?

85
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,173
It just makes me sick.

86
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,903
It's like, uh, some nasty skank who
isn't half the woman my girlfriend is...

87
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,911
is gonna front me?

88
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,913
- It makes me want to fuckin' puke.
- Jesus Christ!

89
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,916
Will you shut up for a minute? We gotta
get you the fuck out of Dodge, man.

90
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:28,317
- We're goin' to Vegas tonight.
- What are you talkin' about?

91
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,915
- Vegas, baby. Vegas!
- What do you mean, Vegas?

92
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,425
- Vegas. Las Vegas.
- I'm not going to no Vegas.

93
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,691
Yeah. I think... You know what, man?
We're gonna go to Vegas and, uh...

94
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,698
- When are we going to Vegas?
- We're going tonight.

95
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,927
- No, we're not going tonight. I'm not going to Vegas!
- I'm gonna pick you up.

96
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,731
- Listen to me.
- No, you listen to me. I'm not going, okay?

97
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:48,604
- None of this shit anymore.
- Listen, I just listened to you; now hear me out.

98
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:51,439
You bring something nice to wear.

99
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,570
- I'm not going to Vegas.
- Mike, we're going.

100
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,580
I'm not going to Vegas.

101
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:59,948
All right, listen. I took out $300,
but I'm only betting with 100.

102
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:03,182
I can't afford any more
than that, all right?

103
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,486
And I figure if we buy a lot of chips,
though, the pit boss will see us,

104
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,890
he'll comp us all sorts of free shit;
that's how it works over there.

105
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,895
- But you gotta be cool.
- I'm cool, baby, I'm cool.

106
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,989
They're gonna give Daddy a room,
some breakfast, maybe Bennett singing.

107
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,591
- I know just the place.
- What the hell are you wearin'?

108
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,602
I thought you said
we're gonna wear suits.

109
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,468
Oh, Mike, you gotta stop worrying
about this. We're goin' to Vegas, man.

110
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,067
If you're wearing a suit, and you look like
you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.

111
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,374
It's in the back.
I'll put it on when we get there.

112
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,641
Uh-uh. No way. No, turn around.
I'm goin' home.

113
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:31,115
You gotta show up wearing that suit,
or otherwise I'm not going.

114
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:35,120
All right already, okay? I'll put my
suit on. Grab the wheel. Hold it steady.

115
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,588
- I'm tellin' you, this is how you do it.
- I know!

116
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,353
- They're watching you when you drive up. That's how it works.
- Fine, fine.

117
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,292
It could work.
I'm serious.

118
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,830
They're gonna give Daddy
the Rain Man suite. You dig that?

119
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,923
- We're going to Vegas, Mike. Vegas!
- Vegas!

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,934
You think we can
get there by midnight?

121
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,936
- We're gonna be up five "hundy" by midnight!
- Yeah!

122
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,633
- Vegas! Vegas!
- Vegas, baby. Vegas!

123
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,876
Vegas, baby. Vegas.

124
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:07,818
'Cause I'm not the happy guy
I used to be

125
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,381
She thinks I

126
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:17,192
Still care

127
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:21,199
But if she's happy thinking

128
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,895
I still need her

129
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,568
Vegas, baby. Vegas.

130
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,748
Vegas.

131
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,376
It's the root of all evil
Of strife and upheaval

132
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:08,278
But I'm certain, honey

133
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,879
That life would be sunny

134
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:16,786
With plenty of money

135
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:20,883
And you

136
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,572
I always thought, uh,
Caesar's was more the dope spot.

137
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,076
Back in their day, this place was a real
contender, but now they'll appreciate the business.

138
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,238
They'll probably fall all over themselves for
a couple of high-class guys like me and you.

139
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,748
- Now, we're not...
- You want to be fresh on the scene, right?

140
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:46,512
The new places down on the strip,
now, those places are supposed to be it.

141
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,851
Oh, Mike, you don't want all that
fuckin' Pirate of the Caribbean horseshit.

142
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,856
Or the rock and roll
grunge tip.

143
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,586
You know, guys like me and
you gotta kick it here. Old school.

144
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,924
Yeah, this is...
This is truly old school.

145
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:00,989
- Definitely old school.
- This place is fuckin' dead.

146
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,592
You know, I'm gonna find me two waitresses
here and I'm gonna pull me a Fredo.

147
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,864
- Yeah, well, they're all skanks.
- What are you talkin' about?

148
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,872
Look at all the
beautiful babies here.

149
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,932
The beautiful babies don't work
midnights to 6:00 on a... on a Wednesday.

150
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,979
- This is the skank shift.
- Look at all the beautiful honeys here.

151
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:17,880
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me, darling. I want you to remember this face here.

152
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,818
This is the guy behind the guy
behind the guy.

153
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,417
Okay.

154
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:29,120
Will you cut that shit out?

155
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,857
- What? She smiled.
- That's not cool, man.

156
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,627
- Did she or did she not smile?
- It doesn't matter.

157
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,760
- Mike, I'm telling you, girls love that stuff.
- You're gonna screw up our plan.

158
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:41,466
- Baby, we're gonna get laid.
- Could we first see what happens when we play it cool?

159
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,840
What do you think, Mike? Do you think she's
gonna leave us and go tell her pit boss on us?

160
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,845
Will you stop makin' fun,
all right?

161
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:51,314
The trick is we gotta look like we don't need
the shit, then they give us shit for free.

162
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,978
Right, right, right.
Well, I think you look great, man.

163
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,079
I think I'm looking like the money,
like the bomb, right?

164
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,819
All right, stop. See that? That, uh,
table? That's where we make our scene.

165
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,884
You think
they'll notice me and you?

166
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,487
Oh, they're gonna notice me and you,
'cause they're watching.

167
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,725
- Nicely done, sir. You're on a streak now.
- It's about time.

168
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:13,261
One of the best streaks
I've ever had. I wanna get even.

169
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:21,112
Uh, start with, uh,
I don't know, 300?

170
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:39,355
I can count that
for you.

171
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,366
- On the table.
- Excuse me?

172
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:45,530
- You have to lay it on the table.
- I don't want to bet it all.

173
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,538
You're not allowed
to hand me money, sir.

174
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,803
You have to lay it on the table
if you want me to change it.

175
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:02,119
- Changing 300.
- Three hundred.

176
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:13,424
- Do you have anything smaller?
- Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.

177
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,764
But this happens to be
a $100 minimum bet table.

178
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,430
Perhaps you'd be more comfortable
at one of our lower stakes tables.

179
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:24,866
Okay, just tuck 'em under,
just like this.

180
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,878
There you go.

181
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,140
Cocktails?

182
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,343
Guy behind the guy.

183
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,784
I'll have a scotch
on the rocks, please.

184
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,516
Any scotch will do, as long
as it's not a blend, of course.

185
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,525
Uh, single malt.
Glenlivet, Glenfiddich perhaps.

186
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,618
Maybe a Glengow... Any Glen.

187
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,129
Scotch on the rocks.

188
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,575
- Double down.
- What?

189
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,848
You got an 11.
You always double down on an 11.

190
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,981
I know, but it's $200.
It's blood money.

191
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,082
- Mike, you gotta double down.
- I can't double down.

192
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,185
- Mike, if you don't look like you know what you're doing...
- Will you stop for a second?

193
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,526
- Just shut up, okay? I can't.
- If you don't look like you know what you're doing...

194
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,497
Just stop for a second!

195
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,932
Double down.

196
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,806
That's nice.

197
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,809
Eighteen. Good. Eighteen's good.

198
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:40,410
Twelve. Sixteen.

199
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,149
Twenty-one.

200
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,125
I'm telling you, baby,
you always double down on an 11.

201
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,289
- Well, obviously not always.
- Always, baby.

202
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,628
I'm just saying not
in this particular case.

203
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,635
- You always double...
- I lost, okay? How could you say "always"?

204
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:01,969
- Lady has 11. What would you like to do?
- Um, I hit.

205
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,738
- Fifteen.
- I don't know what to do here.

206
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,177
I'll hit again.

207
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,181
Seventeen.

208
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,744
Okay. I'll hit there. Okay.

209
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,584
- Twenty-one.
- Oh, my gosh! Twenty-one!

210
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,454
I got it!
Oh, my heavens. Thank you!

211
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,517
Whee!

212
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,393
Would you like to have some breakfast
this morning, ma'am?

213
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:29,025
Oh, I really shouldn't. But then again,
it's a good idea. I'd love it.

214
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,262
- Thank you so much!
- Why not? By all means.

215
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,271
- Take this ticket in with you when you go in.
- Oh, thank you!

216
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,273
- They'll fix you up.
- You'll fix me up.

217
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:42,010
That went plenty nice, baby.
You're up 20 bucks.

218
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,606
You know, I mean not counting
what happened on the first table.

219
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,878
- Thanks for clarifying that.
- I'm down too, Mike.

220
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:50,353
- Yeah? What'd you lose?
- I don't know what I dropped.

221
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,788
Let's see, I dropped
probably 35 or...

222
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:56,123
Don't give me that shit. You know
exactly what you lost. What'd you drop?

223
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:59,790
Twenty, all right? But I was down at least
fifty. I'm sorry. I got lucky on the craps table.

224
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:02,561
You shouldn't be sorry.
You're a winner. I'm the fuckin' loser.

225
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,899
- I'm the one who should be sorry.
- Baby, don't talk that way.

226
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,063
Could we just go, please?
Could we go?

227
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,073
Baby, look at me. Look at me.

228
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:12,076
You're money. And you know what else?
You're a big winner tonight.

229
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,078
- I want to leave.
- You're a big winner.

230
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,910
I'm gonna ask you a simple question,
and I want you to listen to me.

231
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:21,248
Who's the big winner
here tonight at the casino? Huh?

232
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,811
- Mikey, that's who. Mikey's the big winner.
- Okay.

233
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,823
- Mikey wins.
- What a fuckin' asshole.

234
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,758
Fine, I'm an asshole. But you know what?
You're the big winner tonight, Mikey.

235
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,954
- You're the big winner in more ways than one.
- There you two are.

236
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,431
I walked around for an hour
with that stupid scotch on my tray.

237
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,968
We got knocked out pretty fast.

238
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,266
- Ah, a couple of high rollers like yourself?
- Can you believe it?

239
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,670
- I'm gonna get you that scotch.
- You know, forget about it.

240
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,334
- I didn't even want it. I just wanted to order it.
- Can I get you something else?

241
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,538
I mean, you really shouldn't leave
without getting something for free.

242
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,547
Why ruin a perfect night?

243
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,607
Listen, um, bring a single-malted,
uh, Glengarry for me...

244
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,619
and one
for my boy Mikey here.

245
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,747
And if you tell the bartender
to go easy on the water,

246
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:02,226
then this 50-cent piece has your
name written all over it, okay?

247
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,558
I want you to run along,
'cause I'll be timing you.

248
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:09,158
I'm gonna keep time.
One, two, three, four.

249
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:12,567
- What an asshole.
- Baby, that was money. Tell me that wasn't money.

250
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,902
- That was so demeaning.
- She smiled, baby.

251
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,909
- I can't believe what an asshole you are.
- No, baby, she smiled.

252
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,912
- She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
- No, no, no, no, no.

253
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,574
- She was smiling at how money I was, what I did with her.
- Could we get out of here?

254
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,584
- I'm not gonna pay for a room.
- Mike, what the hell do you want to get out of here for?

255
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,086
- The honey baby's bringing us a cocktail.
- What, are you nuts?

256
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,520
- You think she's coming back here?
- I know she's coming back.

257
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,525
Did you hear what she said? "You shouldn't
leave without getting something for free."

258
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:37,494
Baby, she wants to party.
She wants to.

259
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,497
I'm tired. We should just go.

260
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:42,693
Baby, this is what we came for. Now, we
met a beautiful baby, and she likes you.

261
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,760
- She likes you.
- Whatever. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend.

262
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,001
Now, I don't care if I end up with her
or one of her beautiful baby friends.

263
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,910
It's just I been... I been out
of the game for so long, man.

264
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,939
- It's been like six years.
- Listen, it's hard, I know. I been there myself.

265
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,551
Not for six years or anything,
but I've been there.

266
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,085
Not for six years or anything,
but I've been there.

267
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,748
The best thing you can do
is just get back out there.

268
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:08,884
It's just I... I'm not attracted to them.
I keep thinking of my girlfriend.

269
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,895
Then I'm trying to, like,
maintain a conversation with them.

270
00:17:11,963 --> 00:17:15,729
Mike, do you even think I know what the
hell they're saying to me half the time?

271
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,234
I don't know if they're talking
about how hard it is to be adopted...

272
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,737
or how their dad
can't show 'em affection.

273
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:24,263
All I do, man, is stare at their mouth
and wrinkle my eyebrows,

274
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:26,970
and somehow I turn out
to be a big sweetie, okay?

275
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:30,572
Take this girl here.
She's a waitress in Las Vegas.

276
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:34,585
But I bet somewhere inside of her
there is a very, very special dream.

277
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,087
And no matter how hard I try, I won't...

278
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:39,988
Hey, there she is, the most
special lady in town, right?

279
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:42,424
- Yup.
- What time do you get off, uh, Christy?

280
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,428
- 6:00.
- 6:00, great.

281
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,863
- Two Glengarrys down, easy on the water.
- Fantastic.

282
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,925
Uh, listen. Why don't you call a friend
and have her meet the three of us...

283
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:53,527
- at the Bamboo Lounge at 6:01?
- You got it.

284
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,665
- All right?
- Sure. Hey.

285
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:02,507
That was so fuckin' money.
That was like the Jedi mind shit.

286
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,379
See, that's what I'm trying to tell you,
baby. Girls love that kind of stuff.

287
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,418
They don't go
for the sensitive shit.

288
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:10,886
You start talking to 'em about, uh,
you know, puppy dogs and ice cream.

289
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:14,392
They know what you want to do. What do you
think? You really think they don't know?

290
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:17,223
- No. I know.
- They know what you want, baby. Believe me.

291
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:19,729
When you pretend it's just
like a waste of their time.

292
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:23,131
You're gonna take 'em that way
eventually, right? Don't apologize for it.

293
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:27,103
It's just that I get this thing where I want
to be a gentleman and I wanna show respect.

294
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,697
Oh, Mike.
Respect, my ass.

295
00:18:29,774 --> 00:18:31,799
What they respect is honesty.

296
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:35,744
Look, you see how they dress when they go
out, right? They want you to notice 'em.

297
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:39,011
All you're doin' is letting them know that
it's working. Get off this respect kick.

298
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:42,053
There's nothing wrong with letting
the girls know that you're money...

299
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,521
- and that you wanna party.
- You ready to order?

300
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,616
Yeah. I'll have a coffee...
Two, uh, two coffees.

301
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:51,321
And it says, uh, here,
"Breakfast anytime."

302
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,762
That's right.

303
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:57,632
I'll have the, uh, pancakes and the,
uh, age of enlightenment, please.

304
00:18:57,702 --> 00:19:00,296
And for you?

305
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:04,832
Oh, um, let's see,
I'll have the, um, the Toucan.

306
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:07,434
- Over easy.
- I'll be back with the coffee.

307
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:09,707
All right, great.
Nice, baby.

308
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,045
Renaissance.
It went over her head.

309
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:14,711
I should have said renaissance.
Age of enlightenment. I...

310
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:19,052
Oh, God! Like a Las Vegas waitress is gonna
get an obscure French philosophical reference?

311
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,422
It's like I'm trying
to show off to her.

312
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,360
I may as well have just said,
"Let me jump your ignorant bones."

313
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,897
Don't even sweat her.
We're gonna meet our honeys soon.

314
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,661
- You know Christy's friend is gonna be money.
- It's 20 to.

315
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:33,067
- We gotta get out of here.
- Baby, will you relax just for a minute here?

316
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:36,198
Excuse me. We have...
We're in a little bit of a hurry.

317
00:19:36,274 --> 00:19:38,208
Hang on, Voltaire.

318
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:54,715
- I get paid for loving
- Hmm

319
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,091
Loving all the time

320
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,298
- How're you doin', guys?
- Hey, boys.

321
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,926
- We almost gave up on you.
- I'm sorry we're late.

322
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:07,096
- There's, uh, no clocks in this town anywhere.
- No harm done.

323
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,106
- This is Lisa.
- Hi.

324
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,608
- I'm sorry. I never got your name.
- I'm Mike.

325
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:14,110
- Mike.
- This is Trent. We call him Double Down.

326
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,113
- Trent.
- Stop right there.

327
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,945
- Ladies, don't you always double down on an 11?
- Always.

328
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,951
- No matter what. Like splitting aces.
- Whatever.

329
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,647
- Hi, Lisa. I'm Trent. It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

330
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,656
Lovely, uh, make-up job
you have there.

331
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,420
- Oh. Uh, Lisa works at the MGM Grand.
- I'm a Dorothy.

332
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:31,291
Oh, Lisa's a Dorothy.
That's great. That's great.

333
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:36,833
Well, we're not
in Kansas anymore.

334
00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:44,141
So, uh, what do
you guys do?

335
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,769
Well, I'm a comedian.

336
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:55,076
Um, do you ever play out here?
I'd love to see you sometime.

337
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,087
- No.
- Why not?

338
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:00,647
Well, there are, uh... You know,
it's just different circuits.

339
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:03,660
- It's hard to explain. You wouldn't understand.
- Who's your booking agent?

340
00:21:03,728 --> 00:21:06,561
She... She knows...

341
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:09,930
Actually, I don't have
West Coast representation as of yet.

342
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:12,697
Oh, who's your representation
back East?

343
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:16,935
I didn't... I sort of freelanced on
my own, kind of found my own things.

344
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:19,306
- 'Cause I...
- So what do you do, Trent?

345
00:21:19,377 --> 00:21:22,346
- I'm a producer.
- Oh! Cool!

346
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,348
That's great.

347
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,680
I'm really
not supposed to drink here.

348
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:31,313
We should go someplace else.
How's my place?

349
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:33,619
- Yeah, that's great.
- Yeah?

350
00:21:33,691 --> 00:21:36,626
- All right?
- Yeah, we... Yeah, sure.

351
00:21:36,694 --> 00:21:39,458
- Right.
- Because if you can't drink here...

352
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,465
- Then you can't drink.
- Why not?

353
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,468
- That'll be great.
- Okay, great. Let's go.

354
00:21:44,602 --> 00:21:47,594
You were in Acapulco Beach?

355
00:21:47,672 --> 00:21:50,163
We watch that all the time.

356
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:53,404
- No, no, no, no, wait.
- Yeah, yeah.

357
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:57,244
The worst was when I went in for
this Afterschool Special, right?

358
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:59,545
So I'm sitting
in the waiting room,

359
00:21:59,617 --> 00:22:02,711
and there's all these little kids, uh,
sitting in the waiting room with me.

360
00:22:02,787 --> 00:22:05,688
And I see that all the kids are signed
in for the exact same role as me.

361
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:08,658
- They're auditioning for the same role as you?
- Right.

362
00:22:08,726 --> 00:22:12,924
So, uh, I check the time and the place.
I'm where I'm supposed to be.

363
00:22:12,997 --> 00:22:16,831
I call my agent up. She says, "Trent,
they asked for you specifically."

364
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:19,631
- What was the thing?
- I don't know what it was. It was "Drugs are Bad."

365
00:22:19,704 --> 00:22:22,434
"Jenny Eats Something." Whatever.
It's Afterschool Special bullshit.

366
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,441
- Right.
- "Jenny Eats Something."

367
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:28,275
The role I'm reading for is "brother."
I'm reading for the part of "brother."

368
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:30,871
Big brother
or little brother?

369
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:34,112
- Just brother, man. Just brother.
- No.

370
00:22:34,185 --> 00:22:36,949
Just brother, right? Finally I get
to go in and meet everyone, right?

371
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:39,216
Mikey, I'm telling you,
I was money.

372
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,485
It's a starring role.
I practiced for a week.

373
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:45,290
So I'm reading with the casting director
and, girls, I literally start crying.

374
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,297
- No.
- I swear to God.

375
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,629
The casting director who's reading with
me kinda gets caught up in the vibe.

376
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,635
- She starts crying.
- Oh!

377
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,467
- Yeah, I swear to God. Swear to God.
- Wow.

378
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,565
So now she's crying.
I'm crying.

379
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:01,476
We're both kinda crying, but not
the kind of crying that's like...

380
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,071
But the kind of crying that's
like we're trying not to cry.

381
00:23:04,148 --> 00:23:07,413
Do you know what I mean? Like we're not
trying to... Whatever. It was very cool.

382
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:10,215
So I finished reading with her.

383
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:13,086
I finally hold up my finger,
like give me a minute here.

384
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:15,091
- Right.
- Like give me a minute.

385
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:18,595
More than that, 'cause I'm in it.
But like I'm broke.

386
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:22,759
Give me a second here.
May I have a minute?

387
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:26,930
So I put down my head,
and the whole room sits in silence...

388
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,939
for at least five minutes.

389
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,941
- Swear to God, five minutes.
- Whoa!

390
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,307
I look up, everyone
rips up in applause.

391
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:37,109
The whole room is rip-roaring clapping
it up for me, for big T, right?

392
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:41,811
Everyone in the room is sitting there tearing
their face. They're crying their eyes out.

393
00:23:41,886 --> 00:23:45,117
The guy working the camera, you know,
just filming it? Got tears in his eyes.

394
00:23:45,189 --> 00:23:48,124
- Not the camera guy.
- I swear to God, the camera guy.

395
00:23:48,192 --> 00:23:51,286
Not so much from my reading,
although it had a lot to do with it,

396
00:23:51,362 --> 00:23:53,489
but, really, he had
his own things going on.

397
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:56,033
So the producer
starts to talk to me.

398
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,898
He says, "Trent, when you
walked in this room,

399
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,734
I didn't see Trent Walker
come in here."

400
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:05,037
He said, "I saw big brother
come in here." Fuckin' great, right?

401
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:07,703
He says, "You walked in with the role,
you nailed it, you're great."

402
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,612
- So give me the fuckin' part.
- Exactly. Right?

403
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:15,585
Then he says to me... He says,
"Trent, I gotta be honest with you.

404
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:19,749
I think that it might be that
you may be just a little bit old...

405
00:24:19,824 --> 00:24:22,315
for the role of brother."

406
00:24:22,393 --> 00:24:24,918
So I felt confident,
'cause I gave a good read.

407
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,931
I say to him, "Well, how old exactly
is the role of brother?"

408
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,933
- Here it comes.
- 'Cause I'm tall.

409
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,435
- Here it comes.
- But I look young, Mike. Do I look young, girls?

410
00:24:32,503 --> 00:24:34,528
Yeah, you do.

411
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:37,598
So he says to me... I swear to God he
says this to me with a straight face.

412
00:24:37,675 --> 00:24:41,812
This fucking guy.
"Eleven years old."

413
00:24:41,945 --> 00:24:43,879
- And you said "double down."
- Double down.

414
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,246
Because you know why? Because you
make it happen on the bets.

415
00:24:46,316 --> 00:24:48,250
He's great, isn't he?

416
00:24:48,318 --> 00:24:51,776
But the truth of the matter was,
you saw my picture, you saw my tape.

417
00:24:51,855 --> 00:24:54,653
You know I'm 24 years old.
Why did you call me in?

418
00:24:54,724 --> 00:24:57,420
- Wow.
- That's your great bit.

419
00:24:57,494 --> 00:25:01,260
Well, we all have stories.

420
00:25:01,331 --> 00:25:03,265
- Wow.
- Yup.

421
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:16,143
Uh, how rude of me. I never...
I never gave you the... the tour.

422
00:25:37,734 --> 00:25:42,330
Come on home, girl
He said with a smile

423
00:25:42,405 --> 00:25:46,739
You don't have to love me
and let's get high a while

424
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:51,611
But try to understand
Try to understand

425
00:25:51,681 --> 00:25:54,707
- Ohh
- I'm gonna check on my boy.

426
00:25:54,784 --> 00:25:58,117
Ohh, try

427
00:25:58,188 --> 00:26:00,281
Try to understand

428
00:26:00,357 --> 00:26:04,487
Try, try
Try to understand

429
00:26:04,561 --> 00:26:07,257
He's a magic man

430
00:26:13,236 --> 00:26:15,261
I'm sure she'll call.

431
00:26:15,338 --> 00:26:17,568
I mean, six years
is a long time.

432
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:20,735
- You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
- But she did.

433
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,745
- And she's with somebody else now.
- Already?

434
00:26:23,813 --> 00:26:26,976
- Yeah.
- Oh, you poor thing.

435
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,746
- You know what? It won't last.
- Why not?

436
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:33,755
- It's a rebound.
- We were a rebound and we lasted for six years.

437
00:26:33,823 --> 00:26:39,056
Well, yeah, but how long was the
relationship she was rebounding from?

438
00:26:39,129 --> 00:26:41,757
Six years.

439
00:26:41,831 --> 00:26:44,265
Uh, can I check
my messages real quick?

440
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:47,269
- I have a calling card. It won't cost anything.
- Yeah.

441
00:26:47,337 --> 00:26:49,601
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, sure. The phone's in the back.

442
00:26:49,673 --> 00:26:52,107
- I'm not ruining tonight, am I?
- No, it's okay.

443
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:54,268
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Oh, I understand.

444
00:26:54,344 --> 00:26:56,278
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

445
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,854
T.

446
00:27:06,923 --> 00:27:08,857
Trent.

447
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,461
Trent.

448
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,226
I need to, uh, u...

449
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:21,498
No. I gotta... I gotta use...
I gotta use the phone.

450
00:27:21,571 --> 00:27:25,667
- You can check 'em tomorrow.
- I need to use the phone.

451
00:27:25,742 --> 00:27:28,575
Okay? I'm sorry.

452
00:27:28,645 --> 00:27:30,579
Hold on.

453
00:27:33,216 --> 00:27:36,413
I'm sure I... They weren't
in there that long.

454
00:27:36,486 --> 00:27:39,580
I don't think we're
interrupting anything.

455
00:27:46,496 --> 00:27:48,430
I have a calling card.

456
00:27:48,498 --> 00:27:52,229
So it's a 800...
it's a 800 number.

457
00:28:05,915 --> 00:28:09,874
- Six years? Oh, poor thing.
- I know.

458
00:28:09,953 --> 00:28:11,887
- And you know what he said?
- What? What?

459
00:28:11,955 --> 00:28:13,889
- And I believe him.
- What?

460
00:28:13,957 --> 00:28:17,893
- He said, "I just want her to be happy."
- He said that?

461
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:20,794
- It's so sweet. So sweet.
- That is so sweet.

462
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,230
- Oh.
- I know.

463
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:26,291
I'll make some coffee.

464
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:29,065
Mmm.

465
00:28:49,793 --> 00:28:51,556
Did she call?

466
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:57,056
- Oh!
- Oh, Mike, I'm so...

467
00:28:57,133 --> 00:28:59,829
Oh, God.

468
00:28:59,903 --> 00:29:03,532
That's so bad. I'm sorry.

469
00:29:04,741 --> 00:29:07,835
It's gonna be okay.

470
00:29:07,911 --> 00:29:12,041
She asked me what I was thinking about.
Did you want me to lie?

471
00:29:12,115 --> 00:29:15,209
You didn't have to
get into it, baby.

472
00:29:15,285 --> 00:29:17,378
I'm sorry about
interrupting you guys.

473
00:29:17,454 --> 00:29:20,981
Oh, don't worry about it. I just wanted
you to have a good time, that's all.

474
00:29:21,057 --> 00:29:24,959
- Christy was nice.
- Yeah, I really didn't like her that much, to be honest.

475
00:29:25,028 --> 00:29:28,987
- Why not?
- I don't know, man. She just... She didn't really do it for me.

476
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:34,002
What'd you think of that,
uh, Dorothy girl?

477
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:37,062
The whole Judy Garland thing
kinda turned me on.

478
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,735
- Does that make me some kind of a fag?
- No, baby, you're money.

479
00:29:44,314 --> 00:29:47,750
- I don't think she liked me anyway.
- Mike, I'm tellin' you, man.

480
00:29:47,817 --> 00:29:50,911
- She thought you were money.
- I don't think so.

481
00:29:50,987 --> 00:29:54,081
I heard 'em both talking.
Both those girls thought you were money.

482
00:29:54,157 --> 00:29:56,751
You're a good friend.

483
00:29:58,128 --> 00:30:01,097
Look, you take yourself
outta the game.

484
00:30:01,164 --> 00:30:03,758
You start talkin' to 'em
about puppy dogs and ice cream,

485
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:07,030
of course it's going to end up
on the friendship tip.

486
00:30:07,103 --> 00:30:09,037
I just don't think
she liked me in that way.

487
00:30:09,105 --> 00:30:11,869
Baby, you are so money,
and you don't even know it.

488
00:30:11,941 --> 00:30:16,435
Look, T, the girls don't go for me
the way they go for you, okay?

489
00:30:16,513 --> 00:30:18,913
- Michelle went for you, right?
- That's different.

490
00:30:18,982 --> 00:30:21,951
- Why? How is that different?
- We were younger. It was college.

491
00:30:22,018 --> 00:30:24,953
You didn't go to college. You don't know
how it is. The girls are young, they drink.

492
00:30:25,021 --> 00:30:28,957
- They don't know any better.
- Do you know how stupid that sounds?

493
00:30:29,025 --> 00:30:33,962
Listen to me. Your self-esteem is low
right now because she's with somebody else.

494
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:37,796
But talkin' about it and thinkin' about
it all the time, it's depressing.

495
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:41,359
It's no good, man.

496
00:30:41,437 --> 00:30:43,371
I just need
a little more time.

497
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:46,567
Why, so you can sit around your stuffy
apartment beating yourself up over it?

498
00:30:46,643 --> 00:30:50,409
- Remember the first week after she told you?
- Don't remind me.

499
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,541
Huh? Couldn't even
leave your place.

500
00:30:54,617 --> 00:30:57,745
You know, you just sat around
your stuffy apartment,

501
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:01,654
sitting there, drinking orange juice,
feeling sorry for yourself.

502
00:31:01,724 --> 00:31:05,091
Now look at you, man. Right?
I mean, you got a part in a movie.

503
00:31:05,161 --> 00:31:07,755
- A day.
- Whatever, Mike. It's work. You understand?

504
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:12,199
You're doing what you love to do.
What the hell is she doing now?

505
00:31:12,268 --> 00:31:15,260
Selling scrap metal.

506
00:31:15,338 --> 00:31:18,671
Okay. And this guy she's seeing,
what the hell does he do?

507
00:31:18,741 --> 00:31:21,232
- He drives a carriage.
- What?

508
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:24,872
I heard he drives a carriage
around Central Park or something.

509
00:31:24,948 --> 00:31:28,884
Oh, Mike, please! You're
the fun-lovin', outgoing party guy,

510
00:31:28,952 --> 00:31:31,881
and you're sweatin'
some lawn jockey.

511
00:31:31,954 --> 00:31:34,923
Jesus Christ!
I'm tellin' you, man.

512
00:31:34,991 --> 00:31:38,722
You're better off without this girl.
You gotta trust me on this, Mike.

513
00:31:38,795 --> 00:31:42,287
- All right, buddy?
- Stop talking. Shut up.

514
00:31:42,365 --> 00:31:46,529
Okay, I'm gonna try. I promise you I
will shut up if you shut the hell up.

515
00:31:46,602 --> 00:31:49,537
- We're gonna make this work.
- You're damn right you're gonna try.

516
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:52,472
Let's get home.

517
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:56,740
- I'm a man of means by no means
- Los Angeles.

518
00:31:56,813 --> 00:31:59,111
King of the road

519
00:31:59,182 --> 00:32:03,846
I know every engineer
of every train

520
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,219
All their children
and all of their names

521
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:11,317
And every handout
in every town

522
00:32:11,394 --> 00:32:15,057
Every lock that ain't locked
when no one's around

523
00:32:15,231 --> 00:32:18,166
I seen trailers
for sale or rent

524
00:32:18,234 --> 00:32:20,600
- I don't think I'm gonna take it.
- Look, it's a gig.

525
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,604
This is definitely
a step back for me.

526
00:32:22,672 --> 00:32:25,106
There's not much of a call
for Shakespeare in this town.

527
00:32:25,174 --> 00:32:27,608
There's just something
about being Goofy, all right?

528
00:32:27,677 --> 00:32:31,511
Any other Disney character would
be fine. Mickey? Mickey's an icon.

529
00:32:31,581 --> 00:32:34,948
- Why does it have to be Goofy?
- What do you want? You're tall.

530
00:32:35,017 --> 00:32:37,611
How am I gonna
tell my parents?

531
00:32:37,687 --> 00:32:40,383
I still haven't told them
I didn't get the series.

532
00:32:40,456 --> 00:32:42,947
You tested over a month ago.
I'm sure they figured it out.

533
00:32:43,025 --> 00:32:46,620
It's like, "Mom, hi.
I didn't get that pilot.

534
00:32:46,696 --> 00:32:50,325
By the way, I'm Goofy.
Send more money."

535
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,853
Hey, Rob.

536
00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:16,315
You notice I didn't
mention her once today.

537
00:33:16,392 --> 00:33:20,021
- I didn't want to say anything.
- Oh, yeah? Why?

538
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:23,827
Ah, it's kind of like not talking to
your pitcher in the middle of a no-hitter.

539
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,392
- What do you mean? Like you didn't want to jinx it?
- Kinda.

540
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,938
I don't talk about her that much.

541
00:33:30,006 --> 00:33:32,440
- I didn't mention her once today.
- Tend the pin.

542
00:33:32,508 --> 00:33:35,602
The only reason I mentioned her at all was to
tell you I'm not gonna talk about her anymore.

543
00:33:35,678 --> 00:33:38,374
- I thought you'd appreciate that.
- I do. Good for you, Mikey.

544
00:33:41,684 --> 00:33:44,118
- Get there.
- Play it out.

545
00:33:44,187 --> 00:33:47,850
- I decided to get back out there.
- Good. Glad to hear it.

546
00:33:47,924 --> 00:33:51,451
- Can't make any more excuses for myself.
- Excellent.

547
00:33:53,296 --> 00:33:56,129
Do you wanna hit the town tonight?

548
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:59,362
Uh, I shouldn't.
It's a weeknight.

549
00:33:59,435 --> 00:34:04,134
- You got a Pluto callback?
- Yeah, kick me when I'm down.

550
00:34:04,207 --> 00:34:07,176
- All right. Count 'em up.
- How many strokes?

551
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:09,575
One, two, three...

552
00:34:13,983 --> 00:34:15,917
- Eight, nine.
- What'd you get?

553
00:34:15,985 --> 00:34:18,419
- Eight or a nine.
- I'll give you an eight.

554
00:34:18,487 --> 00:34:20,819
- What did you get?
- I got an eight.

555
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:24,257
Dead heat after one hole.
It's turning into quite a rivalry.

556
00:34:24,327 --> 00:34:27,854
You better replace the pin, Chi Chi.
The natives look restless.

557
00:34:29,565 --> 00:34:31,760
You bitch! You bitch!

558
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:34,428
Chelios steals to Roenick.

559
00:34:34,503 --> 00:34:36,767
- Money!
- Bitch!

560
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:38,932
Sue, why is
Gretzky on his ass again?

561
00:34:39,008 --> 00:34:42,603
- Gretzky's a little bitch.
- God, this is such bullshit, man. This is bullshit!

562
00:34:42,678 --> 00:34:45,476
The Kings suck in this game.
You should play another team.

563
00:34:45,548 --> 00:34:48,949
- I took the Kings to the Cup.
- Yeah, against the computer with the offsides off.

564
00:34:49,018 --> 00:34:52,112
- They're a finesse team, bro.
- They're a fuckin' bitch team. Score... Oh!

565
00:34:52,188 --> 00:34:54,782
You bitch!
What a fuckin' bitch!

566
00:34:54,857 --> 00:34:56,916
- Watch out, motherfucker.
- No, you do not fuckin' hit my elbow.

567
00:34:56,993 --> 00:34:59,484
It's not even so much me
as it's Roenick. He's good.

568
00:34:59,562 --> 00:35:01,427
Oh, is that right?

569
00:35:01,497 --> 00:35:03,965
- Chelios steals to Roenick.
- You bitch!

570
00:35:04,033 --> 00:35:06,433
Score Chicago! Ohh!

571
00:35:06,502 --> 00:35:08,436
- That was pretty.
- Such fuckin' bullshit!

572
00:35:08,504 --> 00:35:11,064
But that was pretty, Sue.
Check this out on the instant replay.

573
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,506
- Dude, do not...
- You said it was fuckin' bullshit. Check it out.

574
00:35:13,576 --> 00:35:16,374
Look at it!

575
00:35:16,445 --> 00:35:18,379
- Look at it!
- I don't want to!

576
00:35:18,447 --> 00:35:21,507
Why do you think they put
the instant replay in the fucking game?

577
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:23,984
- God, you're unbelievable.
- So you can see if it's bullshit.

578
00:35:24,053 --> 00:35:27,853
- I am unbelievable. Look at it.
- Every goal you're gonna watch the instant replay?

579
00:35:27,924 --> 00:35:29,858
- Come on, man, I want to fuckin' play.
- I want him to learn it.

580
00:35:29,926 --> 00:35:31,917
- I never get to play.
- You should practice this when I'm not here.

581
00:35:31,994 --> 00:35:34,428
- Just fuckin' move it.
- When I'm not here, will you practice this?

582
00:35:34,497 --> 00:35:36,590
- Wa, wa, wa, wa.
- We'll play some more. He likes to get scored on.

583
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:38,759
- Set the game up.
- Great times.

584
00:35:42,338 --> 00:35:44,431
- Yeah?
- Better play defense.

585
00:35:44,507 --> 00:35:47,601
Okay. Yeah, it's on the fourth floor.
The elevator's broken, okay?

586
00:35:47,677 --> 00:35:50,111
Dude, it's Pink Dot.
Would you buzz him in? Hit nine.

587
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:52,943
I wish they still had fights in
this game so I could bitch-slap Wayne.

588
00:35:53,015 --> 00:35:55,347
- They don't have fighting anymore?
- Doesn't that suck?

589
00:35:55,418 --> 00:35:57,750
Why'd they get rid of the fighting?
It's the best part of the old version.

590
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,845
Kids were hitting each other
or something, man.

591
00:35:59,922 --> 00:36:02,186
But you know what, Mike? You can
make their heads bleed on this one.

592
00:36:02,258 --> 00:36:04,419
- Make somebody's head bleed.
- No, we're in play-offs.

593
00:36:04,493 --> 00:36:07,724
I'm gonna make Wayne Gretzky's head
bleed for super fan number 99 here.

594
00:36:07,797 --> 00:36:10,493
Mikey, get the door?

595
00:36:10,566 --> 00:36:12,761
- Yeah, give me some money.
- Why do I have to give you money?

596
00:36:12,835 --> 00:36:15,599
Give me some fuckin' money.
I'm not paying again.

597
00:36:15,671 --> 00:36:18,367
Jesus Christ.
Pause the game.

598
00:36:18,441 --> 00:36:21,239
- Dude, I'm about to do my thing with the thing.
- Pause the game!

599
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:23,244
- I got fuckin' Wayne.
- Pause it!

600
00:36:23,312 --> 00:36:26,748
All right, I'll pause it.
Jesus Christ. Like you scored all day.

601
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,411
- How much do you want?
- Just give me some money.

602
00:36:30,486 --> 00:36:34,320
Okay, fine. Take my last 20.
Here. Jesus fucking Christ.

603
00:36:36,092 --> 00:36:38,720
There it is, Mikey! Check it out.
His head's bleeding.

604
00:36:38,794 --> 00:36:41,888
Mikey, check it out. His legs... Little
Wayne's legs are shaking all over.

605
00:36:41,964 --> 00:36:45,331
- Fucking bitch! What did you do that for?
- You're the fucking bitch!

606
00:36:45,401 --> 00:36:48,598
- What the fuck are you... Why did
you un-pause it? - Come on, man.

607
00:36:48,671 --> 00:36:51,265
- C'mon, peaches.
- Get the fuck off me.

608
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,934
- I'm not kidding.
- You know what? Look at you. Look at you.

609
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:56,069
- You wanna kiss me. Look at you.
- Get the fuck off.

610
00:36:56,145 --> 00:36:58,079
- Get off!
- Look at you right now.

611
00:36:58,147 --> 00:37:00,809
- Get the fuck off me!
- You're fuckin' makin' me sick! You want to kiss me!

612
00:37:00,883 --> 00:37:05,149
Hey, hold still. Hold on. It's
the fuckin' Pink Dot guy. Hold on.

613
00:37:05,221 --> 00:37:08,657
Hey, Mikey! Mikey, is he cute?

614
00:37:08,724 --> 00:37:11,750
- Is he brown?
- Maybe he'd like to come in and join us for a cocktail.

615
00:37:11,827 --> 00:37:13,761
- Is he polite?
- Is he a brown man?

616
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:16,730
If he's polite, have him come in. If
he's polite, let him in. Is he clean?

617
00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:19,893
Have him come look.
Have him take off his shoes.

618
00:37:19,969 --> 00:37:22,233
Michael, is he clean?
I want to see him!

619
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:26,138
Michael, I want to see him.
Don't let him go! Don't let him go.

620
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:28,733
Get off. I'm serious.
Don't fuckin' do that shit.

621
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:32,076
Oh, he got away from us.
I'm sorry, Michael. Was he nice?

622
00:37:32,148 --> 00:37:37,245
You guys are assholes.
Eat, eat, you fuckin' jackals.

623
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:39,480
- Oh, yeah.
- Nice.

624
00:37:39,555 --> 00:37:41,921
- What time is the party tonight?
- It starts at 8:00.

625
00:37:41,991 --> 00:37:44,585
- Everybody'll get there around 10:00.
- So, what, 11:00?

626
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,855
- Midnight.
- Midnight.

627
00:37:46,929 --> 00:37:50,626
I'm gonna bring an old friend
from back home. He just moved out here.

628
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:52,633
- Who, Rob?
- Yeah, you know him.

629
00:37:52,701 --> 00:37:55,135
Yeah, he's cool.
You'll like him. He's a rounder, Rob.

630
00:37:55,204 --> 00:37:57,434
- What does he do?
- Uh, he's trying to be an actor.

631
00:37:57,506 --> 00:37:59,770
- What a surprise.
- How novel.

632
00:37:59,842 --> 00:38:03,369
So the party started at 8:00.

633
00:38:03,446 --> 00:38:05,880
Why are we going
to a bar at 10:00?

634
00:38:05,948 --> 00:38:09,475
To grab a drink before we meet
the guys for a bite at 11:00.

635
00:38:09,552 --> 00:38:11,486
Where is this place?

636
00:38:11,554 --> 00:38:15,354
For some reason the cool bars in Hollywood
have to be hard to find and have no sign.

637
00:38:15,424 --> 00:38:18,052
It's kind of like a speakeasy
kind of thing. It's kinda cool.

638
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:20,960
It's like you're in on some
kind of secret, you know?

639
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:25,023
You tell a chick you been someplace, it's
like braggin' that you know how to find it.

640
00:38:39,815 --> 00:38:48,118
Excuse me.

641
00:38:51,994 --> 00:38:54,929
I'll get a Dewars on the rocks.
What are you getting?

642
00:38:54,997 --> 00:38:57,932
- Uh, Budweiser.
- A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud.

643
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,527
God, I can't believe
the women in this city.

644
00:39:01,603 --> 00:39:05,403
It's like the hottest one percent
from... from all over the world...

645
00:39:05,474 --> 00:39:07,408
come to our gene pool.

646
00:39:07,476 --> 00:39:09,410
Darwinism at its best.

647
00:39:09,478 --> 00:39:12,447
- Yo, Mikey, what's up?
- Charles! How you doin', man?

648
00:39:12,514 --> 00:39:15,005
- Ah, you know, man. You know.
- You get that pilot?

649
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:18,280
Nah, man. I know you didn't. Otherwise
you wouldn't be askin' me, right?

650
00:39:18,353 --> 00:39:21,720
- That shit wasn't funny anyway.
- Piece of shit.

651
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:25,157
Charles, this is my friend Rob
from back East. He just moved out here.

652
00:39:25,227 --> 00:39:27,161
- My pleasure.
- How you doin', man?

653
00:39:27,229 --> 00:39:29,561
This is Charles.
We went to network on a pilot.

654
00:39:29,631 --> 00:39:31,895
- Oh, yeah, I tested for one.
- A month ago.

655
00:39:31,967 --> 00:39:35,459
- How'd your folks take it?
- Actually, I haven't heard an official "no" yet.

656
00:39:35,537 --> 00:39:38,028
Oh, so you haven't
told them yet.

657
00:39:38,106 --> 00:39:41,234
That's all right, man. I still haven't
told my folks I didn't get Deep Space Nine.

658
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,244
You figure they'd figure
it out by now, right?

659
00:39:43,312 --> 00:39:45,644
- But Moms keeps asking me.
- Boy, does it hurt when they ask.

660
00:39:45,714 --> 00:39:47,944
I don't even tell them about
anything I'm close on anymore.

661
00:39:48,016 --> 00:39:50,246
Not 'til you book it.
You know, you might get cut out.

662
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:53,982
I'm considering taking
a part as Goofy.

663
00:39:54,056 --> 00:39:56,991
- Well, at least it's Disney, right?
- Yeah.

664
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:00,085
Look, we're going to, uh,
we're going to this party in the hills.

665
00:40:00,162 --> 00:40:03,222
Some modeling agency. Beautiful babies.
You want to come with?

666
00:40:03,298 --> 00:40:05,960
Yeah, why not?
This place is dead anyway.

667
00:40:06,034 --> 00:40:08,229
Let's go.

668
00:40:11,807 --> 00:40:14,105
No, no, no, no, no.
Now, you got to admit...

669
00:40:14,176 --> 00:40:16,667
that the Steadicam shot
in GoodFellas was the money.

670
00:40:16,745 --> 00:40:20,112
The basement of the... the restaurant,
the Copa in New York.

671
00:40:20,182 --> 00:40:23,117
- Through the kitchen, Mike.
- I heard it took them four days to light that shot.

672
00:40:23,185 --> 00:40:25,119
Four days?
I don't know about four days.

673
00:40:25,187 --> 00:40:27,280
- Well, that's what I heard.
- They have to hide all the lights.

674
00:40:27,356 --> 00:40:29,290
Jesus, that must've
cost a fortune.

675
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:32,293
That's nothing. You know how much
money my man spent on that Vegas movie?

676
00:40:32,361 --> 00:40:34,295
Wait. You gotta be nuts
to shoot in a casino.

677
00:40:34,363 --> 00:40:36,456
All right, ready. Mean Streets?

678
00:40:36,531 --> 00:40:39,694
- That's the dope.
- Dude, dude. Reservoir Dogs.

679
00:40:39,768 --> 00:40:41,793
- Oh, stop with that fucking Reservoir Dogs.
- Which one?

680
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,430
The one right in the beginning where
they're walking in slow motion, man.

681
00:40:44,506 --> 00:40:46,633
How can you even
compare the two, man?

682
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:49,302
Tarantino completely bites
everything from Scorsese.

683
00:40:49,378 --> 00:40:51,312
- It's true.
- He's derivative.

684
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,644
You know what?
You gotta admit that did look money.

685
00:40:53,715 --> 00:40:56,775
I heard they did
that whole thing for under ten grand.

686
00:40:56,852 --> 00:40:58,979
I don't know what the big deal is. Everybody
steals from everybody. That's movies.

687
00:40:59,054 --> 00:41:01,147
Let's get the hell out
of here if we wanna make this party.

688
00:41:41,496 --> 00:41:43,794
Pick up the pieces
Uh-huh

689
00:41:43,865 --> 00:41:45,890
Pick up the pieces
All right

690
00:41:45,968 --> 00:41:50,431
Pick up the pieces

691
00:42:15,831 --> 00:42:17,765
Whoo

692
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:45,949
Pick up the pieces

693
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:55,497
Pick up the pieces

694
00:43:03,578 --> 00:43:06,638
Uhh
Oh, suki, suki

695
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:12,581
Hey
Uhh, come on

696
00:43:12,654 --> 00:43:16,920
- How you been? Good to see you.
- Hey, good to see you.

697
00:43:16,992 --> 00:43:19,426
- So who threw this party anyway?
- Damned if I know.

698
00:43:19,494 --> 00:43:22,088
- Beats me.
- Hey, I came with you.

699
00:43:22,164 --> 00:43:24,223
Nice.

700
00:43:24,299 --> 00:43:27,427
- Sue!
- What's that guy's name again? Sue?

701
00:43:27,502 --> 00:43:30,903
Sue. Yeah. His dad was a big Johnny Cash
fan from what I understand.

702
00:43:30,972 --> 00:43:33,566
- Oh, right, right, right. The song.
- Yeah, "A Boy Named Sue."

703
00:43:33,642 --> 00:43:36,509
So I think that's why
he's such a mean cat.

704
00:43:36,578 --> 00:43:38,512
- That guy?
- Oh, he's a bad guy.

705
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,276
He don't look it. He's... No, he's mean.
I seen him in a fight once.

706
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:44,944
He had a guy and was fuckin' smackin'
his head into the curb, like his mouth.

707
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:48,456
Just fuckin' smash. His teeth came out.
Just fucking, wha, wha, wha.

708
00:43:48,523 --> 00:43:51,287
Fuckin' blood came out of
his fuckin' mouth. It was nasty, man.

709
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,987
- Nice guy, though. That guy's cool.
- Hey, big Mike.

710
00:43:54,062 --> 00:43:56,997
Hey, how're you doing?
What are you doing here?

711
00:43:57,065 --> 00:43:59,397
- Marty invited me here.
- Oh, yeah? Cool, cool.

712
00:43:59,468 --> 00:44:02,494
Thrill me, baby
I need you

713
00:44:02,571 --> 00:44:06,098
- She looking at me now?
- No.

714
00:44:07,742 --> 00:44:11,178
- How 'bout now? Is she looking over here now?
- No.

715
00:44:15,984 --> 00:44:19,249
What about now?
Is she looking now?

716
00:44:19,321 --> 00:44:22,085
No, she's not looking at you, dude. Will
you quit asking me if she's looking at you?

717
00:44:22,157 --> 00:44:26,423
- She hasn't looked at you... Wait, she just looked.
- See what I'm sayin', man?

718
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:29,487
You understand?

719
00:44:29,564 --> 00:44:31,930
I got some friends I wanna go meet.
I'll talk to you later.

720
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,093
- Nice to see you. I'll give you a call.
- All right. Take care.

721
00:44:34,169 --> 00:44:36,103
- All right, man.
- Who's that?

722
00:44:36,171 --> 00:44:38,366
I don't know, man.

723
00:44:43,011 --> 00:44:45,946
- You know, there's so many beautiful women.
- Unbelievable, dude.

724
00:44:46,014 --> 00:44:49,108
- Unbelievable.
- Okay, I gotta try once.

725
00:44:49,184 --> 00:44:51,277
- You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
- I have to.

726
00:44:51,353 --> 00:44:53,287
- I made a promise to myself.
- Go. Go for it.

727
00:44:53,355 --> 00:44:55,949
I have to get out there sooner
or later, right? So I gotta go now.

728
00:44:56,024 --> 00:44:59,118
- Okay, you're gonna be my wing man?
- I'll be your winger.

729
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:16,241
Hi. Uh, how are you ladies
doing this evening?

730
00:45:17,946 --> 00:45:20,437
What do you drive?

731
00:45:20,515 --> 00:45:22,745
E- Excuse me?

732
00:45:22,817 --> 00:45:26,082
What kind of a car
do you drive?

733
00:45:26,154 --> 00:45:28,588
Uh, Cavalier.

734
00:45:28,657 --> 00:45:31,990
See what I mean?
It's the same old shit all the time.

735
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:35,325
It's... It's red. I have...
It's a red Cavalier.

736
00:45:35,397 --> 00:45:38,093
That's nice.

737
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:41,927
- How are you guys doing?
- It's on, Mike. It's on.

738
00:45:42,003 --> 00:45:44,267
- Yeah? Which one?
- Uh, Groucho.

739
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:46,273
With the cigar?

740
00:45:47,642 --> 00:45:49,940
- She's cute, man.
- Jesus Christ.

741
00:45:50,011 --> 00:45:51,945
What's wrong?

742
00:45:52,013 --> 00:45:55,278
- Mike, you just looked right at her.
- Come on, she didn't notice.

743
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:58,114
- Yeah, she did.
- I better go in early now.

744
00:45:58,186 --> 00:46:01,121
- I'm sorry, man. I didn't know.
- Don't sweat it, Mike.

745
00:46:01,189 --> 00:46:03,384
It's gonna be a lay-up.

746
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:05,790
36-24-36
What a winnin' hand

747
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,385
- Uh...
- How're you guys doing?

748
00:46:08,463 --> 00:46:10,727
- Not well.
- What, rejected?

749
00:46:10,799 --> 00:46:12,733
"Shaqued."

750
00:46:12,801 --> 00:46:15,565
Just watch old T-bone
there and learn.

751
00:46:15,637 --> 00:46:20,109
She's a brick house

752
00:46:20,242 --> 00:46:24,313
My whole life people have told me
I have this star quality.

753
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:26,747
- Have they?
- Well, I don't know if it's true.

754
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:29,409
But, well, this one time...
this is really stupid...

755
00:46:29,485 --> 00:46:31,817
- But in kindergarten, you know...
- It's all right.

756
00:46:31,887 --> 00:46:35,254
You know how you have those little
crushes? I had this crush on this guy Lee.

757
00:46:35,324 --> 00:46:39,055
He was really cute, and he
wore Lee Jeans. They said "Lee."

758
00:46:39,128 --> 00:46:42,063
Anyway, I really liked him.
And then one day he told me I was ugly.

759
00:46:42,131 --> 00:46:45,589
I started crying,
and my teacher was, like,

760
00:46:45,667 --> 00:46:48,761
"Deidre, you are so emotional.
You are so dramatic.

761
00:46:48,837 --> 00:46:51,067
You should be an actress!"

762
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:54,234
- It was, like, that's it!
I should be an actress.

763
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:56,937
And you know what?
I can cry on cue.

764
00:46:57,012 --> 00:46:58,946
- Yeah! Well, totally.
- Uh-huh.

765
00:46:59,014 --> 00:47:02,006
Well, that's really been sort of my
thing, you know. It got me into Juilliard.

766
00:47:02,084 --> 00:47:04,348
And the agent said to me
afterwards that he thought...

767
00:47:04,419 --> 00:47:06,353
he really was reminded by me...

768
00:47:06,421 --> 00:47:08,582
of Tina Yothers,
you know, from Family Ties.

769
00:47:08,657 --> 00:47:11,023
And he said
I looked just like her.

770
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:22,760
She's the one, the only one
Built like an Amazon, Yeah

771
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:25,238
Was that money or what?

772
00:47:25,307 --> 00:47:27,901
Kind of a dick move,
if you ask me.

773
00:47:27,976 --> 00:47:30,137
Why, baby?
What'd I do wrong?

774
00:47:30,212 --> 00:47:33,079
- You asked a girl for her number and you tore it up.
- She didn't see that.

775
00:47:33,148 --> 00:47:35,639
- It doesn't matter.
- That was pretty cold, dude.

776
00:47:35,717 --> 00:47:38,242
What was so cold about it?

777
00:47:40,722 --> 00:47:42,656
Right.

778
00:47:42,724 --> 00:47:45,818
See, man, you can't roll with that.
She's business class.

779
00:47:45,894 --> 00:47:49,421
- Business class?
- Big butt. You know, can't fly coach?

780
00:47:49,498 --> 00:47:51,432
You guys are terrible.

781
00:47:52,834 --> 00:47:56,600
Gentlemen,
out of Glenfiddich.

782
00:47:56,672 --> 00:47:59,266
- What else is going on?
- Could hit the Dresden.

783
00:47:59,341 --> 00:48:01,275
Perfect.

784
00:48:01,343 --> 00:48:05,370
Well, this place
is dead anyway, man. Let's do it.

785
00:49:12,014 --> 00:49:14,949
What do you say, man?

786
00:49:15,017 --> 00:49:17,349
You can tell by the way
I use my walk

787
00:49:17,419 --> 00:49:19,887
I'm a woman's man
No time to talk

788
00:49:19,955 --> 00:49:21,889
- Hi, friends.
- The music's loud and women warm

789
00:49:21,957 --> 00:49:25,051
I've been kicked around
since I was born

790
00:49:25,127 --> 00:49:28,722
Now it's all right, it's okay
You may look the other way

791
00:49:28,797 --> 00:49:33,200
- You can try to understand
- New York Times' effect on man

792
00:49:33,268 --> 00:49:35,236
Whether you're a brother
or whether you're a mother

793
00:49:35,304 --> 00:49:37,738
We're staying alive
Staying alive

794
00:49:37,806 --> 00:49:40,001
Feel the city shaking
and everybody's breaking

795
00:49:40,075 --> 00:49:42,407
I'm staying alive
Staying alive

796
00:49:42,477 --> 00:49:49,849
Ah, ha, ha, ha
Staying ali-ive

797
00:49:49,918 --> 00:49:53,649
Ahh, ahh

798
00:49:59,294 --> 00:50:02,422
Yeah, I know what you're saying, man.
I just don't know what to tell you.

799
00:50:02,497 --> 00:50:04,761
I mean, does it
have to be Goofy?

800
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:08,269
You know, I was Hamlet two months
ago Off-Broadway, and I was good.

801
00:50:08,337 --> 00:50:10,567
- Yeah.
- Wow!

802
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:14,939
- Someone got out of school early today.
- They like our vibe.

803
00:50:19,414 --> 00:50:22,178
- Oh, it's on.
- It's definitely on.

804
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,184
Feel the city shaking
and everybody's breaking

805
00:50:24,252 --> 00:50:26,584
We're staying alive
Staying alive

806
00:50:26,655 --> 00:50:30,955
- Ah, ha, ha, ha, staying alive Staying alive
- God bless you guys.

807
00:50:31,026 --> 00:50:39,058
Ah, ha, ha, ha
Staying ali-ive

808
00:50:39,134 --> 00:50:41,694
Ahh, ahh

809
00:50:44,873 --> 00:50:49,776
Hi, can I get a Dewars on the, uh,
Dewars on the rocks?

810
00:50:51,213 --> 00:50:55,149
- I-I can't even get
this guy to notice me.

811
00:50:55,217 --> 00:50:58,152
You're laughing at me?
That's funny to you, huh?

812
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,984
Great. Good. Great day.

813
00:51:01,056 --> 00:51:03,320
I- I'm sorry. I shouldn't.

814
00:51:03,392 --> 00:51:07,158
- Let me make it up to you.
- Hang on, Nick.

815
00:51:07,229 --> 00:51:10,255
That's pretty...
They know you around here, huh?

816
00:51:10,332 --> 00:51:12,994
Uh, hi. I'll have a Dewars
on the rocks, please.

817
00:51:13,068 --> 00:51:17,835
And some more olives for...
for our little friend here.

818
00:51:17,906 --> 00:51:21,103
Do I know you?
I mean, where do I know you from?

819
00:51:21,176 --> 00:51:25,340
Um, you ever been
to the Ha-Ha Hole on Pico?

820
00:51:25,414 --> 00:51:28,406
- Hmm, no.
- No? You're sure? Monday nights, open mike?

821
00:51:28,483 --> 00:51:31,316
- I host an open mike there.
- Hmm, no.

822
00:51:31,386 --> 00:51:33,786
Oh, you're...
you're a comedian.

823
00:51:33,855 --> 00:51:36,483
Yeah.

824
00:51:36,558 --> 00:51:40,426
Yeah, it's a dream, you know. It's a lot
of hard work and travel and, uh, hotels.

825
00:51:40,495 --> 00:51:43,828
I have a new booking agent, though, so
I'm part of the whole Vegas circuits.

826
00:51:43,899 --> 00:51:48,131
The money's pretty good. I might buy
a car, I think. You know, a foreign car.

827
00:51:48,203 --> 00:51:50,637
Treat myself. I figure
I worked for it. Why not?

828
00:51:50,705 --> 00:51:53,731
I know where it is.
Starbucks.

829
00:51:53,809 --> 00:51:56,801
I served you an espresso
at Starbucks.

830
00:51:56,878 --> 00:52:00,279
Espresso. An espresso. Yes, that's
my drink. That's probably it.

831
00:52:00,348 --> 00:52:02,282
That's great.
Isn't that funny?

832
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:04,511
You came in and asked me
for an application.

833
00:52:04,586 --> 00:52:07,680
And then I took you and
introduced you to my manager.

834
00:52:10,325 --> 00:52:13,192
Must've been a while ago, 'cause
right now I have a booking agent.

835
00:52:13,261 --> 00:52:16,253
'Cause I've been... I have
a booking agent now that I've got.

836
00:52:16,331 --> 00:52:18,265
- No.
- Yeah.

837
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:20,927
- It was about two weeks ago.
- It was probably more.

838
00:52:21,002 --> 00:52:23,766
Probably longer, 'cause things
have been going very well lately.

839
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:25,773
I haven't been looking
for a job in a while.

840
00:52:25,841 --> 00:52:28,605
It could have been someone who looks like me,
'cause there's a lot of people who look kinda...

841
00:52:28,677 --> 00:52:32,340
- See, I have a face that's similar...
- You better pay the man.

842
00:52:32,414 --> 00:52:36,544
Here's the, uh...
Here's... Just take this.

843
00:52:36,618 --> 00:52:39,712
I've been doing very well.
Thank you. Uh, thank you...

844
00:52:39,788 --> 00:52:42,120
- Nikki.
- Nikki. Thank you, Nikki.

845
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:44,124
Mm-hmm.

846
00:52:46,962 --> 00:52:49,897
- We got digits, baby.
- Yeah, what a surprise.

847
00:52:49,965 --> 00:52:52,456
What's wrong with you? I saw you
talkin' to a beautiful brunette baby.

848
00:52:52,534 --> 00:52:54,968
She didn't like me, okay?
I made a fool of myself.

849
00:52:55,036 --> 00:52:58,472
- Baby, don't talk that way.
- You're so money, and you don't even know it.

850
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:02,067
- That's what I keep tryin' to tell him.
- Could you not mess with me?

851
00:53:02,143 --> 00:53:05,010
- Baby, we're not messing with you.
- We're not.

852
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,413
You know what you are? You're like
a big bear with claws and fangs, man.

853
00:53:08,483 --> 00:53:11,077
- Big fuckin' teeth, man.
- Yeah, big fuckin' teeth on ya.

854
00:53:11,152 --> 00:53:14,417
She's just like this little bunny who's
just kinda cowering in the corner.

855
00:53:14,489 --> 00:53:17,424
- Shivering.
- Yeah, man, just kinda...

856
00:53:17,492 --> 00:53:20,427
You got these claws and you're staring at
these claws, and you're thinkin' to yourself,

857
00:53:20,495 --> 00:53:23,191
with these claws, you're thinkin', "How
am I supposed to kill this bunny?"

858
00:53:23,265 --> 00:53:25,199
You're pokin' at it, man.

859
00:53:25,267 --> 00:53:27,869
You're not hurtin' it. You're just
kinda gently battin' the bunny around.

860
00:53:28,002 --> 00:53:30,454
You know what I mean?
And the bunny's scared of you.

861
00:53:30,455 --> 00:53:32,906
- And it's shivering.
- You got the fucking claws!

862
00:53:32,974 --> 00:53:36,432
These claws and these fangs! You're
looking at your claws and your fangs.

863
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:39,104
You're thinking to yourself,
"I don't know what to do, man.

864
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:42,946
I don't know how to kill the bunny." With
this, you don't know how to kill the bunny!

865
00:53:43,017 --> 00:53:45,611
You're like
a big bear, man.

866
00:53:45,686 --> 00:53:48,450
- So you're not just fuckin' with me?
- No, I'm not fucking with you!

867
00:53:48,522 --> 00:53:50,456
- Honestly!
- Mike, I'm telling you, you're money.

868
00:53:50,524 --> 00:53:52,458
You're so fucking money.

869
00:53:52,526 --> 00:53:54,790
I want you to go over to that girl
and I want you to get those digits.

870
00:53:54,862 --> 00:53:56,796
- You're money.
- Come here a second. Listen to me.

871
00:53:56,864 --> 00:53:59,458
Look it, when you go up
to talk to her, man,

872
00:53:59,533 --> 00:54:04,630
I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13
movie everyone's really hoping makes it happen.

873
00:54:04,705 --> 00:54:07,799
I want you to be like the guy
in the rated R movie, you know?

874
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:10,241
The guy you're not sure
whether or not you like yet.

875
00:54:10,311 --> 00:54:12,745
You're not sure where he's coming
from, okay? You're a bad man.

876
00:54:12,813 --> 00:54:15,077
You're a bad man.
You're a bad man.

877
00:54:15,149 --> 00:54:17,344
Bad man.

878
00:54:55,957 --> 00:54:58,391
All right, all right.

879
00:55:00,027 --> 00:55:02,587
See, baby,
it's not that hard.

880
00:55:02,663 --> 00:55:04,961
- 818?
- 310.

881
00:55:05,032 --> 00:55:07,125
Nice.

882
00:55:07,201 --> 00:55:09,692
- So how long do I wait to call?
- A day.

883
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:12,170
- Tomorrow.
- Mm-mmm.

884
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:14,173
- Tomorrow, then a day.
- Yeah.

885
00:55:14,241 --> 00:55:17,233
- So two days.
- Yeah, I guess you could call it that... two days.

886
00:55:17,311 --> 00:55:19,745
Definitely. Two days
is like industry standard.

887
00:55:19,814 --> 00:55:24,478
I used to wait two days to call anybody, but
now it's like everyone in town waits two days.

888
00:55:24,552 --> 00:55:26,543
So I think three days is kinda money.
What do you think?

889
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:29,418
- Two's enough not to look anxious.
- Two's enough not to look anxious.

890
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:31,685
But I think three days
is kinda money.

891
00:55:31,759 --> 00:55:33,693
Maybe I'll wait three weeks.
How's that?

892
00:55:33,761 --> 00:55:36,093
And tell her I was cleaning out my wallet
and I just happened to run into her number.

893
00:55:36,163 --> 00:55:38,097
- Then ask her where you met her.
- Yeah.

894
00:55:38,165 --> 00:55:40,929
I don't remember. What does she look
like? Then I'll ask if we fucked.

895
00:55:41,002 --> 00:55:43,266
Would that...
T, would that be the money?

896
00:55:43,337 --> 00:55:45,430
You know what? Ha, ha, ha, Mike.
Laugh all you want.

897
00:55:45,506 --> 00:55:50,842
But if you call too soon, you might scare
off a nice baby who's ready to party.

898
00:55:50,911 --> 00:55:55,245
- How long are you guys gonna wait to call your babies?
- Six days.

899
00:55:55,316 --> 00:55:59,946
Different, I don't know, schools of
philosophy, they all can fight each other.

900
00:56:02,023 --> 00:56:05,459
- I think I like this town.
- No, no, gotta go to New Orleans.

901
00:56:05,526 --> 00:56:07,460
Hey, how're you doin'?

902
00:56:08,729 --> 00:56:11,095
Watch where you're going, asshole.

903
00:56:11,165 --> 00:56:13,099
What'd you say, bitch?

904
00:56:15,636 --> 00:56:18,434
I said watch where
you're going, bitch.

905
00:56:18,506 --> 00:56:22,272
- Oh, so you want something.
- Hey, fucker. Hey.

906
00:56:22,343 --> 00:56:24,607
- Fuck him up.
- Smack that fuckin' bitch.

907
00:56:24,678 --> 00:56:27,374
- Yeah, motherfucker.
- You got a fucking problem with me, bitch?

908
00:56:27,448 --> 00:56:30,349
Come on! Yeah, I got
a fuckin' problem, motherfucker!

909
00:56:30,418 --> 00:56:33,182
- Yeah, come on!
- You're the fuckin' bitch, baby!

910
00:56:33,254 --> 00:56:36,621
- Come on, bitch. You little fuckin' pussy!
- Come on, punk, do it.

911
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:38,681
- Slap that bitch.
- Roll up, bitch.

912
00:56:38,759 --> 00:56:42,718
- Hey, you're a fuckin' bitch! You're a fuckin' bitch!
- You wanna go?

913
00:56:42,797 --> 00:56:45,630
I'll show you who
the fucking bitch is!

914
00:56:45,699 --> 00:56:47,894
Huh?

915
00:56:47,968 --> 00:56:51,096
You're the fucking bitch!

916
00:56:51,172 --> 00:56:53,663
Motherfucker!

917
00:57:00,214 --> 00:57:03,650
- What the fuck?
- You asshole! Didn't you see Boyz N the Hood?

918
00:57:03,717 --> 00:57:06,777
- Now one of us is gonna get shot.
- He ain't gonna do anything.

919
00:57:06,854 --> 00:57:09,220
- You fuckin' asshole.
- What a fuckin' dick.

920
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:12,225
What the fuck did you want me to do,
back down? He called me a bitch.

921
00:57:12,293 --> 00:57:15,888
- We kept our rep, bro.
- Fuck rep, man. I got a callback tomorrow.

922
00:57:15,963 --> 00:57:18,295
Yeah, I gotta get up
early tomorrow.

923
00:57:20,468 --> 00:57:25,167
What the fuck are you carrying a gun for?
In case somebody steps to you, Snoop Dogg?

924
00:57:25,239 --> 00:57:27,298
Hey, man, you're not from here.
You don't know how it is.

925
00:57:27,374 --> 00:57:29,433
- I grew up in L.A.
- Anaheim.

926
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:33,105
Whatever, man. It's different out here.
It's not like New York, Mikey.

927
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:36,809
Fuckin' A right, it's not like New York.
Out here you can avoid trouble.

928
00:57:36,884 --> 00:57:40,581
It's not like you live in Compton, Sue,
with bullets whizzing by your head.

929
00:57:40,654 --> 00:57:43,851
You live in a good neighborhood, man.
In New York trouble finds you.

930
00:57:43,924 --> 00:57:47,655
- People get carjacked.
- Oh, man, who would ever carjack your fuckin' K car?

931
00:57:47,728 --> 00:57:49,992
He's right, Sue.
You don't need to carry a gat.

932
00:57:50,064 --> 00:57:52,498
Just 'cause I had the balls
to stand up to these guys...

933
00:57:52,566 --> 00:57:55,000
Like fuckin' House of Pain
was gonna do anything?

934
00:57:55,069 --> 00:57:58,732
- You like in this fucking fantasy world.
- Wha...

935
00:57:58,806 --> 00:58:01,832
What about you, Mikey?
At least I fuckin' have balls, man.

936
00:58:01,909 --> 00:58:05,868
You're always whining about some bitch
that left you a year ago!

937
00:58:05,946 --> 00:58:08,471
It was six months ago,
and she didn't leave me.

938
00:58:08,549 --> 00:58:11,643
Whatever, man! You're like
a fuckin' little whiny bitch, man.

939
00:58:11,719 --> 00:58:14,654
Oh, whoopee, you got a number tonight?
You're gonna fuck it up.

940
00:58:14,722 --> 00:58:19,125
- Hey, Sue.
- No. Have you gotten laid once since you moved out here?

941
00:58:19,193 --> 00:58:22,287
- Have you fucked once?
- Why don't you shut the fuck up for a little bit?

942
00:58:22,363 --> 00:58:24,797
I know for a fact that you haven't.
You know how I know?

943
00:58:24,865 --> 00:58:27,959
- 'Cause you never shut up about it!
- Shut the fuck up, Sue!

944
00:58:28,035 --> 00:58:30,833
- Ah, he's fuckin' right.
- Shut up! Hey, Mike, come here.

945
00:58:30,905 --> 00:58:34,068
Mike, come back here!
Mike, come back here!

946
00:58:34,141 --> 00:58:36,974
- He was fuckin' pissing me off!
- Just shut the fuck up.

947
00:58:37,044 --> 00:58:40,639
Just shut the fuck up. I don't even
want to fuckin' talk to you right now.

948
00:58:40,714 --> 00:58:43,512
- I do...
- Shut the fuck up!

949
00:58:59,066 --> 00:59:01,660
You have no messages.

950
00:59:55,923 --> 00:59:59,552
Hi, this is Nikki. Leave a message.

951
00:59:59,627 --> 01:00:01,959
Hi. Uh, Nikki, this is Mike.

952
01:00:02,029 --> 01:00:05,726
I met you at the, um,
at the Dresden, uh, tonight.

953
01:00:05,799 --> 01:00:09,667
Uh, I just called t-to say
that I had a great time...

954
01:00:09,737 --> 01:00:13,138
and you should call me tomorrow,
or in, uh, t-two days, uh, whatever.

955
01:00:13,207 --> 01:00:15,198
Anyway, uh, my number...

956
01:00:15,276 --> 01:00:20,213
is 213-555-4679...

957
01:00:34,795 --> 01:00:37,730
Hi, this is Nikki. Leave a message.

958
01:00:37,798 --> 01:00:39,732
Hi, uh, Nikki,
this is Mike again.

959
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,735
I just called 'cause it sounded like
your machine might've cut me off...

960
01:00:42,803 --> 01:00:45,738
when, uh, when I... before I finished
leaving my number.

961
01:00:45,806 --> 01:00:49,071
Anyway, uh... And also, uh,
sorry to call so late,

962
01:00:49,143 --> 01:00:53,079
but you were still at the Dresden when
I left, so I knew I'd get your machine.

963
01:00:53,147 --> 01:00:55,615
Anyhow, uh, uh,
my number's 2-1...

964
01:01:03,624 --> 01:01:06,354
Hi, this is Nikki. Leave a message.

965
01:01:06,427 --> 01:01:10,363
213-555-4679. That's it.
Just wanna leave my number.

966
01:01:10,431 --> 01:01:13,889
I didn't want you to think
I was weird or desperate or...

967
01:01:15,035 --> 01:01:16,969
We should just,
uh, hang out...

968
01:01:17,037 --> 01:01:18,971
and, uh, see where it goes.

969
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:21,974
'Cause it's nice and, uh,
you know, no expectations.

970
01:01:22,042 --> 01:01:24,977
So, okay?
Thanks a lot. Bye-bye.

971
01:01:39,693 --> 01:01:42,127
Hi, this is Nikki. Leave a message.

972
01:01:42,196 --> 01:01:44,630
I just got out of a six-year
relationship, okay?

973
01:01:44,698 --> 01:01:48,634
That should help explain why I'm acting
so weird. I just wanted you to know that.

974
01:01:48,702 --> 01:01:51,637
It's not you, it's me.
I'm sorry.

975
01:01:54,008 --> 01:01:55,737
This is Mike.

976
01:02:04,752 --> 01:02:07,186
Hi, this is Nikki. Leave a message.

977
01:02:07,254 --> 01:02:10,189
Hi, Nikki, this is Mike. Could you just,
uh, call me when you get in?

978
01:02:10,257 --> 01:02:13,192
I'm gonna be up for a while and
I'd rather speak to you in person...

979
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:15,524
instead of trying to fit it all into...

980
01:02:15,596 --> 01:02:17,757
Fuck!

981
01:02:25,372 --> 01:02:28,535
Hi, this is Nikki. Leave a message.

982
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:32,103
Uh, Nikki? M-Mike.

983
01:02:33,614 --> 01:02:35,673
It's, uh, uh...
It's just, uh...

984
01:02:35,749 --> 01:02:37,683
This just isn't working out.

985
01:02:37,751 --> 01:02:41,118
I- I think you're great,
but, uh, I-I...

986
01:02:41,188 --> 01:02:44,316
Maybe we should just take
some time off from each other.

987
01:02:44,391 --> 01:02:48,327
It's not you, it's me.
It's what I'm going through.

988
01:02:48,395 --> 01:02:50,829
All right? Uh, i-i-it's, it...

989
01:02:50,898 --> 01:02:53,833
It's only been six months...

990
01:02:53,901 --> 01:02:56,563
- Mike?
- Nikki! Great!

991
01:02:56,637 --> 01:03:00,471
D- Did you just walk in,
or were you listening all along?

992
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:03,203
Don't ever call me again.

993
01:03:03,277 --> 01:03:06,212
Wow. I-I guess you're home.

994
01:03:27,668 --> 01:03:30,296
Hey, this is Mike.
Leave a message after the beep.

995
01:03:32,373 --> 01:03:37,106
Hey, Mikey, it's Trent.
You home? You there?

996
01:03:37,177 --> 01:03:39,611
All right, man,
I guess you're not home.

997
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,706
Why don't you come out tonight, Mikey?
I haven't seen you for two days.

998
01:03:42,783 --> 01:03:45,308
We're gonna play hockey
at Sue's house until 10:30,

999
01:03:45,386 --> 01:03:48,321
and then we're either going to
the Lava Lounge for Sinatra Night...

1000
01:03:48,389 --> 01:03:51,324
or we'll be at the Derby
for Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.

1001
01:03:51,392 --> 01:03:54,327
We might also check out
Swing Night at the El Rey.

1002
01:03:54,395 --> 01:03:57,330
And if we're not there we'll be
at the Three of Clubs, all right?

1003
01:03:57,398 --> 01:04:01,391
Otherwise we'll be at the Dresden Room,
so come on out and meet up with us.

1004
01:04:01,468 --> 01:04:03,993
See you soon, gorgeous.

1005
01:04:57,191 --> 01:05:00,627
Hey, this is Mike. Leave a message
after the beep.

1006
01:05:00,694 --> 01:05:02,628
Mikey, it's Rob.
I'm downstairs.

1007
01:05:02,696 --> 01:05:05,722
Come on, pick it up
and buzz me in, buddy.

1008
01:05:05,799 --> 01:05:07,733
Come on, open up.

1009
01:05:34,928 --> 01:05:36,862
Thanks, man.

1010
01:05:41,668 --> 01:05:43,602
You eat anything today?

1011
01:05:50,477 --> 01:05:52,411
Yesterday?

1012
01:05:52,479 --> 01:05:54,640
You haven't been drinking,
have you?

1013
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:14,226
- Sorry about what happened at the Dresden, man.
- Oh, don't worry about it, man.

1014
01:06:14,301 --> 01:06:17,236
It's like, now I have my L.A. gun story.

1015
01:06:17,304 --> 01:06:21,832
You should hear the way I tell it
to the guys back home... it's an Uzi.

1016
01:06:27,147 --> 01:06:30,674
- You wanna talk about it?
- What's the point?

1017
01:06:37,291 --> 01:06:40,226
Hey, it's been two days.
You should call that Nikki girl.

1018
01:06:43,931 --> 01:06:45,626
Not your type.

1019
01:06:49,136 --> 01:06:52,071
I'm thinking of
moving back East.

1020
01:06:54,141 --> 01:06:57,076
- Well, that's dumb.
- What's so dumb about it?

1021
01:06:57,144 --> 01:07:00,079
You're doing really well
out here, Mike.

1022
01:07:00,147 --> 01:07:02,081
How well am I doin'?

1023
01:07:02,149 --> 01:07:05,585
I host an open mike;
I play a fuckin' bus driver in a movie.

1024
01:07:05,652 --> 01:07:07,586
Big fuckin' deal.

1025
01:07:07,654 --> 01:07:10,088
I got an agent
that specializes in magicians.

1026
01:07:10,157 --> 01:07:12,091
How good am I doin'?

1027
01:07:12,159 --> 01:07:14,855
Did you get turned down
for Goofy?

1028
01:07:14,928 --> 01:07:16,862
They turned you down?

1029
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:21,367
Yeah, they went with somebody who had
some more theme park experience.

1030
01:07:21,435 --> 01:07:23,596
I killed for that job.

1031
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:27,936
The point is, Mike, it all depends
on how you look at it. All right?

1032
01:07:28,008 --> 01:07:32,240
You're telling me that your life sucks.
That means mine is god-awful.

1033
01:07:32,312 --> 01:07:35,839
Part of the reason I moved out here
is I saw how well you were doing,

1034
01:07:35,916 --> 01:07:38,851
and I figured if you could
make it, I could too.

1035
01:07:38,919 --> 01:07:42,855
- I didn't make it.
- You got an agent. You got in the unions.

1036
01:07:42,923 --> 01:07:45,721
You know, that's your problem,
is that you...

1037
01:07:46,894 --> 01:07:49,829
You don't look at
the things that you have.

1038
01:07:49,897 --> 01:07:52,832
You only look at the stuff
you don't have.

1039
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,391
Those guys are right about you.
You're money.

1040
01:07:56,537 --> 01:07:59,301
Then why won't she call?

1041
01:08:01,642 --> 01:08:03,667
She won't call
because you left.

1042
01:08:05,245 --> 01:08:08,544
She's got her own life to deal with,
man, and that's in New York.

1043
01:08:08,615 --> 01:08:11,550
She's a sweet girl
and I love her to pieces,

1044
01:08:11,618 --> 01:08:14,553
but fuck her, man...
you gotta get on with your life.

1045
01:08:14,621 --> 01:08:19,888
You gotta let go of the past, and Mikey,
when you do the future is beautiful.

1046
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:22,155
All right?
Look out the window.

1047
01:08:22,229 --> 01:08:26,222
It's sunny every day here.
It's like manifest destiny.

1048
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:31,237
Don't tell me we didn't make it.
We made it. We are here.

1049
01:08:31,305 --> 01:08:34,240
Everything that is past
is prologue to this.

1050
01:08:34,308 --> 01:08:37,277
All of the shit that
didn't kill us is only...

1051
01:08:37,344 --> 01:08:39,539
Ah, you know.
All that shit.

1052
01:08:40,814 --> 01:08:42,907
You're gonna get over it.

1053
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:49,556
How did you get over it?
How long did it take?

1054
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:54,082
I don't know.
Sometimes it still hurts.

1055
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,424
You know how it is, man.
It's like...

1056
01:08:56,496 --> 01:08:59,431
You wake up every day,
it hurts a little bit less,

1057
01:08:59,499 --> 01:09:02,627
then you wake up one day
and it doesn't hurt at all.

1058
01:09:02,702 --> 01:09:04,602
And the funny thing is...

1059
01:09:04,671 --> 01:09:07,606
This is kinda weird,
but it's like...

1060
01:09:08,675 --> 01:09:10,609
you almost miss that pain.

1061
01:09:16,549 --> 01:09:18,642
You miss the pain?

1062
01:09:20,119 --> 01:09:23,384
Yeah, for the same reason
that you miss her.

1063
01:09:23,456 --> 01:09:26,391
Because you... you lived
with it for so long.

1064
01:09:32,231 --> 01:09:34,597
Let's go get
something to eat.

1065
01:09:34,667 --> 01:09:36,828
All right. Sure.

1066
01:09:36,903 --> 01:09:38,837
You look like shit.

1067
01:09:44,577 --> 01:09:46,943
Mikey! What's up, man?

1068
01:09:47,013 --> 01:09:48,947
You wanna play again, motherfucker?

1069
01:09:49,015 --> 01:09:51,449
I'm glad you came out tonight.
It's good to see you.

1070
01:09:51,517 --> 01:09:53,849
- You're my problem, you bitch motherfucker!
- Come on in.

1071
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,854
- Come on, bitch!
- You want some?

1072
01:09:55,922 --> 01:09:58,083
- Hey, guys! Mikey's here!
- What's up, Mikey?

1073
01:09:58,157 --> 01:10:01,092
What's up, baby?

1074
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:04,493
- Oh, so you want some? You want some?
- You ain't shit!

1075
01:10:04,564 --> 01:10:07,965
Roll up, bitch! Roll up!
Roll. That's right.

1076
01:10:08,034 --> 01:10:10,502
You run. You run, baby.

1077
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:13,130
Blast him!
Come on, hit him!

1078
01:10:13,206 --> 01:10:15,140
- All right.
- Okay, bitch.

1079
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:17,176
- You ready, hip hop?
- Uh-huh.

1080
01:10:17,243 --> 01:10:19,837
- Come on, man! Let's move it up!
- Hey, man.

1081
01:10:19,912 --> 01:10:22,039
What are they doing here?

1082
01:10:22,115 --> 01:10:24,049
Oh, no, no,
it's totally cool, man.

1083
01:10:24,117 --> 01:10:26,745
We saw 'em that night at Roscoe's.
Trent cleared it up.

1084
01:10:26,819 --> 01:10:29,788
I apologized, bought 'em some
chicken and waffles. It's totally fine.

1085
01:10:29,856 --> 01:10:33,292
They fuckin' love T, man.
That boy can talk.

1086
01:10:36,696 --> 01:10:38,391
More important, man,

1087
01:10:38,464 --> 01:10:40,398
I'm sorry about what I said.

1088
01:10:40,466 --> 01:10:43,924
I was out of line. I was drunk,
my adrenalin was goin'.

1089
01:10:44,003 --> 01:10:46,870
Yeah, you know, whatever.
I needed a good kick in the ass.

1090
01:10:46,939 --> 01:10:51,239
It was a... I don't know. We're better
friends for it. All right?

1091
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:53,904
All right, man.

1092
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:56,073
- Roll up, bitch! Roll!
- Come on, let's see it!

1093
01:10:56,149 --> 01:10:58,242
- Thanks, man.
- Get off me!

1094
01:10:58,317 --> 01:11:01,309
I been hatin' myself
for the last few days.

1095
01:11:01,387 --> 01:11:05,414
- That's all right. I keep it in the zone.
- Look, I know what that's like.

1096
01:11:05,491 --> 01:11:08,426
- Come on, Superman.
- You watchin', New Kids On The Block?

1097
01:11:08,494 --> 01:11:11,429
- Yo, Double Down, what time we leaving?
- Five minutes, baby.

1098
01:11:11,497 --> 01:11:14,933
Hey, Mikey, you should call that
girl Nikki. It's been two days.

1099
01:11:15,001 --> 01:11:17,936
See if she wants to
meet you there.

1100
01:11:34,187 --> 01:11:36,121
Hey, Curt.

1101
01:11:38,691 --> 01:11:42,127
Aw, we got a line.
We got a line.

1102
01:11:42,195 --> 01:11:44,129
Hey, what's up, Lisa?

1103
01:11:45,932 --> 01:11:48,867
- Let's just take the front.
- We don't gotta wait in line.

1104
01:11:48,935 --> 01:11:51,369
Come on, Mike.

1105
01:11:56,109 --> 01:11:58,043
Hey, hey, Tony.
Whadda ya say, man?

1106
01:11:58,111 --> 01:12:00,045
- How you doin' tonight?
- Hey, Gary.

1107
01:12:00,113 --> 01:12:03,048
- What's goin' on?
- Hey, Tony, man, how'd the audition go?

1108
01:12:03,116 --> 01:12:06,051
- Not happening, man.
- Yeah? You look like you been workin' out though.

1109
01:12:06,119 --> 01:12:08,053
- All right.
- How you doin', man?

1110
01:12:08,121 --> 01:12:10,055
Watch the steps.
They're greasy.

1111
01:12:25,872 --> 01:12:29,364
And it's you and me and the
bottle makes three tonight

1112
01:12:35,181 --> 01:12:37,615
Hey, whadda ya say, man?

1113
01:12:37,683 --> 01:12:40,345
Hey, how's it goin'?
What's up?

1114
01:12:40,419 --> 01:12:42,478
- Hey.
- Que paso?

1115
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:47,425
How you doin', Annie?
Good to see you. I'll see you soon.

1116
01:12:47,493 --> 01:12:49,427
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hola. Como esta?

1117
01:12:49,495 --> 01:12:51,929
- Raoul, what's up, man?
How's it goin'?

1118
01:12:51,998 --> 01:12:53,932
Keep the waters comin'.

1119
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,798
My favorite watering hole

1120
01:12:56,869 --> 01:12:59,394
I said, hey, Moe
How you doin'

1121
01:12:59,472 --> 01:13:01,303
Where have you been

1122
01:13:01,374 --> 01:13:05,868
He said, I been found
buyin' whiskey wine and gin

1123
01:13:05,945 --> 01:13:08,140
Man, I know we gotta go

1124
01:13:08,214 --> 01:13:10,409
It's the same thing
every night

1125
01:13:10,483 --> 01:13:14,579
But I don't think another drink
is gonna make me lose my mind

1126
01:13:14,654 --> 01:13:17,282
So I'll think about
my next drink

1127
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:21,787
And it's you and me and the bottle
makes three tonight

1128
01:13:21,861 --> 01:13:23,556
Come on, Daddy,
let's get us a drink.

1129
01:13:40,613 --> 01:13:42,774
Swing it, kid!

1130
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,315
Yo! Bartender!

1131
01:13:50,389 --> 01:13:54,416
And Jack, oh, I know
what you're thinkin'

1132
01:13:54,493 --> 01:13:59,123
That now's as good as any
to start drinkin'

1133
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:01,826
- Hey, Scotty. - Yeah?
- What's it gonna be

1134
01:14:03,369 --> 01:14:06,998
A gin and tonic sounds
mighty, mighty good to me

1135
01:14:08,174 --> 01:14:10,233
Well, man, I know
we gotta go

1136
01:14:10,309 --> 01:14:13,142
It's the same thing
every night

1137
01:14:13,212 --> 01:14:16,739
But I don't think another drink
is gonna make me lose my mind

1138
01:14:16,816 --> 01:14:19,979
So I'll think about
my next drink

1139
01:14:21,821 --> 01:14:24,119
And it's you and me and the bottle
makes three tonight

1140
01:14:25,958 --> 01:14:33,662
And it's you and me and the bottle
makes three tonight

1141
01:14:33,733 --> 01:14:35,428
Okay!

1142
01:14:35,501 --> 01:14:37,435
- To ladies?
- To ladies.

1143
01:14:38,738 --> 01:14:40,672
Gin time.

1144
01:14:41,741 --> 01:14:43,675
I don't know.
I called you Monday.

1145
01:14:43,743 --> 01:14:47,975
You called me? Well, who
did you talk to? I was home Monday.

1146
01:14:48,047 --> 01:14:51,414
It surprises me that you've never mentioned
her before, all the times we've hung out.

1147
01:14:51,484 --> 01:14:53,918
- You never even mentioned me?
- Very pretty girl.

1148
01:14:53,986 --> 01:14:57,319
- I totally mentioned her... I totally mentioned you.
- I'm sorry. Maybe I don't know.

1149
01:14:57,390 --> 01:15:00,325
- Hi, Mike. How are you?
- You know what's funny?

1150
01:15:00,393 --> 01:15:04,056
- When we... When we played football that day,
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

1151
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:07,327
I don't remember you ever leaving long
enough to make a phone call to anybody.

1152
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,834
This is what happened.
She's a nice girl.

1153
01:16:13,632 --> 01:16:15,566
Excuse me.

1154
01:16:32,484 --> 01:16:34,418
- Hi.
- Hi.

1155
01:16:35,554 --> 01:16:38,284
- I'm, uh, I'm Mike.
- Hi, Mike.

1156
01:16:38,357 --> 01:16:40,848
- I'm Lorraine.
- Like the quiche.

1157
01:16:40,926 --> 01:16:44,225
Yeah, yeah, the quiche.
That's a really original joke.

1158
01:16:45,631 --> 01:16:47,565
I like quiche. How's that?

1159
01:16:47,633 --> 01:16:51,069
Yeah? Well, I thought real men
didn't like quiche.

1160
01:16:51,136 --> 01:16:54,936
Yeah, well, uh, my reputation seems
to have preceded me here.

1161
01:16:55,007 --> 01:16:56,941
You're not a real man?

1162
01:16:58,010 --> 01:16:59,944
Not lately, no.

1163
01:17:01,013 --> 01:17:02,947
Not funny, okay?

1164
01:17:03,015 --> 01:17:05,677
- You're fuckin' hurting feelings here.
- Hey, it's on. It's on.

1165
01:17:05,751 --> 01:17:08,948
- Oh. It's on.
- It is so on.

1166
01:17:13,926 --> 01:17:17,953
I figured, they make movies in L.A.,
not in Wisconsin, so I moved here.

1167
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:19,964
Just like that.

1168
01:17:20,032 --> 01:17:23,559
- Well, yeah. It wasn't that simple, but...
- How was it hard?

1169
01:17:25,638 --> 01:17:27,629
I left someone
really special behind.

1170
01:17:27,706 --> 01:17:29,640
Tell me about it.

1171
01:17:29,708 --> 01:17:32,438
- You too?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1172
01:17:32,511 --> 01:17:34,445
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

1173
01:17:34,513 --> 01:17:37,175
- Oh. I thought I was gonna die.
- Oh, God.

1174
01:17:37,249 --> 01:17:41,049
It's been six months and I'm just
starting to get over it now.

1175
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,486
Wow, that's two more
than me.

1176
01:17:43,555 --> 01:17:47,514
- Tell me it gets better.
- Oh, it does, yeah. It does.

1177
01:17:47,593 --> 01:17:49,652
God bless him.

1178
01:17:51,597 --> 01:17:53,690
God bless that kid.

1179
01:17:53,766 --> 01:17:55,996
That's great, man.

1180
01:17:56,068 --> 01:17:58,002
What advantages, you mean?

1181
01:17:58,070 --> 01:18:01,471
Yeah. You said there are
advantages to being single.

1182
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:04,168
I just wanna know
what the advantages are.

1183
01:18:04,243 --> 01:18:07,644
Well, exactly, it's like,
you know, you, uh, have com...

1184
01:18:07,713 --> 01:18:12,741
If you meet a girl in a bar and talk to her, you
don't have to worry if anybody's watching you.

1185
01:18:12,818 --> 01:18:14,718
What else?

1186
01:18:14,787 --> 01:18:17,221
What? You can do
whatever you want, you know.

1187
01:18:17,289 --> 01:18:20,383
You grow, go out, anything.

1188
01:18:20,459 --> 01:18:23,690
Like, if I met a handsome
young man at a bar,

1189
01:18:23,762 --> 01:18:26,060
I could just ask him to dance?

1190
01:18:26,131 --> 01:18:29,225
If the guy wanted to, yeah.

1191
01:18:29,301 --> 01:18:31,269
You don't think
he would want to?

1192
01:18:31,337 --> 01:18:36,274
Oh, yeah... No, I mean, he would
want to with you. Sure. I mean, if he...

1193
01:18:36,342 --> 01:18:39,869
Sure. M-M-Maybe it's just that
he doesn't feel like dancing.

1194
01:18:40,979 --> 01:18:42,913
Would you dance with me?

1195
01:18:43,982 --> 01:18:45,916
Okay.

1196
01:18:49,788 --> 01:18:52,723
Dude, check it out, dude.
I swear to God, it's fuckin' on.

1197
01:18:52,791 --> 01:18:55,225
- Dude, it's so fuckin' on, dude.
- I know. It's on.

1198
01:18:55,294 --> 01:18:57,228
- Give it up for Mike.
- Look, I...

1199
01:18:57,296 --> 01:19:00,231
- Dude, it's fucking on, dude!
- Okay, okay. It's on, dude.

1200
01:19:00,299 --> 01:19:03,029
- It's on. To you.
- Jesus Christ. I'm sorry.

1201
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:46,106
Thanks.

1202
01:19:51,016 --> 01:19:52,347
Go, daddy-o

1203
01:19:55,654 --> 01:19:56,643
Go, daddy-o

1204
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:02,150
Go, daddy-o

1205
01:20:40,999 --> 01:20:42,933
Go!

1206
01:21:13,532 --> 01:21:14,521
Go, daddy-o

1207
01:21:18,036 --> 01:21:19,970
Go, daddy-o

1208
01:21:22,741 --> 01:21:24,106
Go, daddy-o

1209
01:22:20,665 --> 01:22:22,599
All right.

1210
01:22:29,173 --> 01:22:31,107
This is it.

1211
01:22:33,511 --> 01:22:35,445
Yeah.

1212
01:22:35,513 --> 01:22:38,448
- I had a... I had a great time tonight.
- Me too.

1213
01:22:40,184 --> 01:22:42,277
We should do it again
some time.

1214
01:22:42,353 --> 01:22:44,218
I'll be around.

1215
01:22:44,289 --> 01:22:46,223
That's not gonna be
good enough.

1216
01:22:46,291 --> 01:22:49,226
I wanna make plans
to see you again.

1217
01:22:51,462 --> 01:22:53,396
I got a pen in my car.

1218
01:22:53,464 --> 01:22:56,399
- Uh, I mean, yeah.
Do you have something to write on?

1219
01:22:56,467 --> 01:22:58,958
Yeah. Yeah.

1220
01:23:04,609 --> 01:23:07,442
Ahh. Oh, you're a comedian.

1221
01:23:07,512 --> 01:23:09,946
- Yeah, and an actor. Kind of.
- Oh.

1222
01:23:10,014 --> 01:23:11,948
Can I come see you
some time?

1223
01:23:12,016 --> 01:23:14,951
If and when I get a real gig,
I'll give you a call.

1224
01:23:15,019 --> 01:23:17,954
- How's that?
- It's not going too well?

1225
01:23:18,022 --> 01:23:21,287
No, when I, uh, I lived in
New York they made it sound...

1226
01:23:21,359 --> 01:23:26,126
like, uh, they were giving sitcoms
out to stand-ups at the airport here.

1227
01:23:26,197 --> 01:23:29,132
I been here six months,
all I got to show for it is black lung.

1228
01:23:35,807 --> 01:23:39,243
Didn't you tell me that
I should be patient with my career?

1229
01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:43,246
Yeah, but entertainment law
isn't something you just jump into.

1230
01:23:43,314 --> 01:23:46,340
Well, neither is acting,
not if you're serious about it.

1231
01:23:48,019 --> 01:23:50,954
- Yeah.
- Can I have one of these cards?

1232
01:23:51,022 --> 01:23:53,718
- Why? You like the duck with the cigar?
- Yeah.

1233
01:23:53,791 --> 01:23:56,521
Yeah, it's the logo
from You Bet Your Life.

1234
01:23:56,594 --> 01:23:59,529
- Nice touch.
- I can't believe you got that.

1235
01:23:59,597 --> 01:24:02,532
You know, not one
club owner got that.

1236
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:06,036
- They all asked me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
- They're idiots.

1237
01:24:06,104 --> 01:24:08,038
At least it's not Goofy.

1238
01:24:10,341 --> 01:24:14,004
Well, I guess I should be getting home.
It's really getting late.

1239
01:24:14,078 --> 01:24:17,275
Yeah, sure. It's gettin'
kinda late, so you probably...

1240
01:24:17,348 --> 01:24:21,284
Do you want me to drive you
to your car?

1241
01:24:21,352 --> 01:24:23,479
- That's my hog right th...
- Oh.

1242
01:24:23,554 --> 01:24:25,988
No, I'm across the street. Yeah.

1243
01:24:26,057 --> 01:24:28,992
- Yeah? Which one?
- The red piece of shit over there.

1244
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:31,722
- Yeah? Well, it suits you.
- Get the hell outta here.

1245
01:24:31,796 --> 01:24:33,730
Okay.

1246
01:25:03,628 --> 01:25:06,392
Party, buddy! Yeah! Dig that!

1247
01:25:09,233 --> 01:25:12,100
- Will you shut up?
- You were great tonight!

1248
01:25:12,170 --> 01:25:15,435
There she is!

1249
01:25:15,506 --> 01:25:20,500
The wonderful lady. Right? Personality
plus, every time I come in here.

1250
01:25:20,578 --> 01:25:23,775
Nothin' but smiles for me.
Whatever. Here it is.

1251
01:25:23,848 --> 01:25:26,476
Dinner at the Apollo.
Me and you.

1252
01:25:26,551 --> 01:25:28,815
- See that? He's being funny.
- Whatever.

1253
01:25:28,886 --> 01:25:32,014
I don't have to be liked by everyone. Some
don't like me. I don't like certain people.

1254
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:35,526
- Darlin', I think everything looks absolutely wonderful.
- Thank you.

1255
01:25:35,593 --> 01:25:38,323
- Oww! What the hell are you kickin' me for?
- Shh!

1256
01:25:38,396 --> 01:25:43,095
Fine, I'll ask her. Ma'am! Where do the
high school girls hang out around here?

1257
01:25:43,167 --> 01:25:45,761
You were fuckin'
off your ass tonight.

1258
01:25:45,837 --> 01:25:47,862
- Shh.
- Where'd you learn your stuff, man?

1259
01:25:47,939 --> 01:25:50,965
- The twirly-whirly...
- Shh, just be... Shh. Jackknife, shut up.

1260
01:25:51,042 --> 01:25:53,476
I took a ballroom class
with Michelle.

1261
01:25:53,544 --> 01:25:56,980
She's the only one I danced with
'til tonight. That Lorraine is good.

1262
01:25:57,048 --> 01:25:59,983
You are definitely good. Did you even
see how she was vibing you tonight?

1263
01:26:00,051 --> 01:26:03,748
- Sorry, man.
- You coulda hit that if you didn't have to take us home.

1264
01:26:03,821 --> 01:26:05,755
- Definitely.
- It's not like that.

1265
01:26:05,823 --> 01:26:08,758
- Don't give me that shit. I think she likes you.
- I know she does.

1266
01:26:08,826 --> 01:26:11,260
- I really do!
- Shh! Shut up, okay? I know she likes me.

1267
01:26:11,329 --> 01:26:14,264
- I just didn't wanna do anything tonight.
- You know what, Mike?

1268
01:26:14,332 --> 01:26:16,266
- Wait three days before you call her.
- You don't have to wait.

1269
01:26:16,334 --> 01:26:18,268
- He should wait two days.
- If he's smart about it...

1270
01:26:18,336 --> 01:26:21,271
Shh! You know what?
I have it under control. Okay?

1271
01:26:21,339 --> 01:26:23,273
He has it under control.

1272
01:26:23,341 --> 01:26:25,775
Well, I guess we don't have to
worry about him anymore.

1273
01:26:25,843 --> 01:26:27,777
Our little baby's
all "growns" up.

1274
01:26:27,845 --> 01:26:30,177
- You know what?
- Shh! Shut up. Come on.

1275
01:26:30,248 --> 01:26:33,183
- Our little baby's all "growns" up.
- Why do you have to...

1276
01:26:33,251 --> 01:26:36,186
- I'm not even hungry.
I couldn't touch it.

1277
01:26:36,254 --> 01:26:41,191
Why do you have to make a major production
every time we go out and embarrass me?

1278
01:26:41,259 --> 01:26:44,126
You know what... Oh, Jesus Christ.
That's all I need.

1279
01:26:44,195 --> 01:26:47,494
Our little boy's
all "growns" up tonight!

1280
01:26:47,565 --> 01:26:51,001
You know what, big boy?
You're grown up! You're grown up!

1281
01:26:51,068 --> 01:26:53,263
Yeah! Dig that!

1282
01:26:53,337 --> 01:26:55,271
Is this a fuckin'
production for ya?

1283
01:26:55,339 --> 01:26:58,672
'Cause you're "growns" up and you're
"growns" up and you're "growns" up.

1284
01:26:58,743 --> 01:27:02,406
- Jesus.
- I'm the asshole in the place. Right? I'm the asshole?

1285
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,414
- Oh, God.
- I'm outta here, honey.

1286
01:27:04,482 --> 01:27:07,849
- I wouldn't eat here...
I would never eat here anyway.

1287
01:27:23,501 --> 01:27:25,469
I like cake

1288
01:27:25,536 --> 01:27:27,697
And no mistake

1289
01:27:27,772 --> 01:27:31,435
But baby, if you insist

1290
01:27:31,509 --> 01:27:33,977
I'll cut out cake

1291
01:27:34,045 --> 01:27:35,774
Just for your sake

1292
01:27:35,847 --> 01:27:39,977
Baby, come on
and knock me a kiss

1293
01:27:53,364 --> 01:27:55,298
Knock me a kiss

1294
01:28:55,159 --> 01:28:57,252
- Hello?
- Hi, Michael.

1295
01:28:58,629 --> 01:29:03,123
- Michelle?
- Hi. How's it goin'? It's been a while.

1296
01:29:05,703 --> 01:29:08,433
- S-Six months.
- How are you doin'?

1297
01:29:09,674 --> 01:29:12,666
Uh, fine, I guess.

1298
01:29:12,743 --> 01:29:14,768
- H-How are you?
- Good.

1299
01:29:17,548 --> 01:29:19,914
I, um, I think about things.

1300
01:29:20,985 --> 01:29:23,613
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1301
01:29:25,189 --> 01:29:27,123
What kind of things?

1302
01:29:27,191 --> 01:29:30,456
You know, us.

1303
01:29:30,528 --> 01:29:33,292
- I thought you met someone else.
- It doesn't matter.

1304
01:29:33,364 --> 01:29:37,425
- I think about you every day.
- Really?

1305
01:29:37,501 --> 01:29:40,902
I miss you, Mike.

1306
01:29:40,972 --> 01:29:43,133
Why didn't you call?

1307
01:29:43,207 --> 01:29:46,574
I don't know.
I mean, I couldn't.

1308
01:29:46,644 --> 01:29:49,078
Do you know how hard it is
to not call you?

1309
01:29:49,146 --> 01:29:52,582
I mean, I pick up the phone every night,
whenever that commercial comes on.

1310
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:56,484
- The Michelin commercial?
- Yeah, you know, the one with the baby in the tire.

1311
01:29:56,554 --> 01:29:59,751
- One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre.
- Pierre?

1312
01:29:59,824 --> 01:30:02,088
Th-That's his name, Pierre?
What, is he French?

1313
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:06,255
No, he's not. Listen, it's a whole other
headache and I don't want to talk about him.

1314
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:08,615
I, um, I called 'cause I heard you
might be moving back to Queens.

1315
01:30:08,616 --> 01:30:10,900
I, um, I called 'cause I heard you
might be moving back to Queens.

1316
01:30:10,968 --> 01:30:16,031
- Yeah. Hang on a second.
Let me get rid of this.

1317
01:30:16,107 --> 01:30:18,200
- Hello?
- Hi, Mike?

1318
01:30:18,275 --> 01:30:20,607
- Lorraine!
- Are you on the other line?

1319
01:30:20,678 --> 01:30:22,942
- Yeah. Oh, hang on a second...
- I could call back.

1320
01:30:23,014 --> 01:30:26,040
No, no. You hang on, okay?
I want to talk to you.

1321
01:30:26,117 --> 01:30:28,108
Just hold on. Hello?

1322
01:30:28,185 --> 01:30:31,279
So I heard you might be
moving back to New York.

1323
01:30:31,355 --> 01:30:35,485
Yeah, I don't think that's going to be happening
just yet. Um, can I call you right back?

1324
01:30:35,559 --> 01:30:39,962
Um, well, I'm going out of town
for a week and the cab's on its way.

1325
01:30:40,031 --> 01:30:42,261
Can't you just talk to me
for five minutes?

1326
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:44,733
Look, there's somebody holding on the
other line. I have to take this call.

1327
01:30:44,802 --> 01:30:48,067
I really want to catch up with you,
but, um, I have to take the call.

1328
01:30:48,139 --> 01:30:50,903
So just... Uh, I'm gonna call you back
when you get back into town.

1329
01:30:50,975 --> 01:30:52,909
- Okay?
- Okay.

1330
01:30:52,977 --> 01:30:54,911
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

1331
01:30:54,979 --> 01:30:57,072
- Really? You sure?
- It's all right. All right.

1332
01:30:57,148 --> 01:30:59,275
- All right, bye-bye.
- Good-bye. I love y...

1333
01:30:59,350 --> 01:31:02,581
- Hello?
- Hi. Oh, you didn't have to get off of the other line.

1334
01:31:02,653 --> 01:31:05,816
- I would've called you back.
- No, that's okay. I wanted to talk to you.

1335
01:31:05,890 --> 01:31:08,324
You know, I really could...
could've called you back, but...

1336
01:31:08,392 --> 01:31:11,759
Anyway, I probably should have waited
two days. That's what my friends said.

1337
01:31:11,829 --> 01:31:14,593
But... God, I sound like such a schoolgirl.
It's just, they have this thing, okay?

1338
01:31:14,665 --> 01:31:16,599
It's at The Room.
It's Sinatra's birthday.

1339
01:31:16,667 --> 01:31:20,159
And it's one of these Hollywood clubs
and there's no sign.

1340
01:31:20,237 --> 01:31:23,104
Uh, I don't understand why...
why they don't have any signs.

1341
01:31:23,174 --> 01:31:25,608
It's just
I'm really bad at this.

1342
01:31:25,676 --> 01:31:30,113
I just want to know
if you might want to go with me.

1343
01:31:32,349 --> 01:31:35,614
- So, uh, you hung up on which one?
- Michelle.

1344
01:31:35,686 --> 01:31:38,177
- You hung up with your girlfriend.
- Ex.

1345
01:31:38,255 --> 01:31:40,553
- Oh, now she's your ex.
- She was always my ex.

1346
01:31:40,624 --> 01:31:42,558
Yeah, right.

1347
01:31:44,395 --> 01:31:48,991
- You hung up with her?
- I wanted to take the other call.

1348
01:31:49,066 --> 01:31:51,534
- What'd she say when you called her back?
- I didn't.

1349
01:31:54,305 --> 01:31:57,968
- You didn't call her back?
- No.

1350
01:31:58,042 --> 01:32:02,206
- Why not, Mike?
- It didn't occur to me.

1351
01:32:04,048 --> 01:32:05,982
Didn't occur to you.

1352
01:32:06,050 --> 01:32:08,678
It didn't.

1353
01:32:08,752 --> 01:32:13,519
You been, uh, tearing yourself
up about this girl for six months.

1354
01:32:14,592 --> 01:32:16,526
Didn't occur to you?

1355
01:32:18,295 --> 01:32:20,695
No.

1356
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,833
Well, Michael, I'll bite.

1357
01:32:28,439 --> 01:32:33,206
You know, man, I didn't understand
it either. It's all so hard.

1358
01:32:33,277 --> 01:32:36,610
Then it hit me on the way over here,
you know, like a ton of bricks.

1359
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:38,614
It's just so simple.

1360
01:32:38,682 --> 01:32:41,276
- When you...
- Dude, dude, wait a second.

1361
01:32:45,456 --> 01:32:48,448
I'm getting vibe like
in a really weird way here.

1362
01:32:50,294 --> 01:32:53,422
This girl's looking at me
like she knows me a little bit.

1363
01:32:53,497 --> 01:32:55,522
- You don't recognize her?
- Mike, I don't know.

1364
01:32:55,599 --> 01:32:58,625
I could've been out with Sue one night
drinking and told her I was a race car driver.

1365
01:32:58,702 --> 01:33:02,331
No, I think I would
remember this girl.

1366
01:33:02,406 --> 01:33:06,809
I don't think I've ever met her before.
I would definitely remember this one.

1367
01:33:06,877 --> 01:33:10,711
She got a lot of confidence, man.
She's doing like...

1368
01:33:10,781 --> 01:33:14,239
- Wow.
- What's going...

1369
01:33:14,318 --> 01:33:16,616
Mike, stop, stop.
Stop, all right? Just stop.

1370
01:33:16,687 --> 01:33:19,087
She's playing a little game,
like a fun thing with me.

1371
01:33:19,156 --> 01:33:22,922
Come on, you little party girl.
That's it. Come on. Fun little games?

1372
01:33:22,993 --> 01:33:26,656
You want to play fun little games? Come
on, you nasty little, cute little baby.

1373
01:33:26,730 --> 01:33:30,598
- What are you doing?
- Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike. Stop. Don't. Don't, don't.

1374
01:33:30,668 --> 01:33:33,432
She's smiling at me.
She's playing fun little baby games.

1375
01:33:33,504 --> 01:33:36,598
She don't know me. She doesn't
know my address. You know my address?

1376
01:33:36,674 --> 01:33:39,609
You little...
Oh, you... Hold on.

1377
01:33:39,677 --> 01:33:42,612
She's coming over, dude.
Play it cool. She's coming over.

1378
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:46,309
She's like the wild loony. But I threw,
like, the great vibe at her, the funny vibe.

1379
01:33:46,383 --> 01:33:48,510
You'll see.

1380
01:33:48,586 --> 01:33:51,612
- Shit.
- Mommy's big boy.

1381
01:33:51,689 --> 01:33:54,556
We're going bye-bye now.
Yes, we're going bye-bye.

1382
01:33:54,625 --> 01:33:58,288
We're gonna go home,
gonna play with Daddy.

1383
01:34:06,470 --> 01:34:10,236
So, um, so you
called her up, right?

1384
01:34:10,307 --> 01:34:13,242
Or you didn't call her. Why didn't you
call her? You said you didn't call her.

1385
01:34:13,310 --> 01:34:15,696
Why didn't you call her? Mike?

1386
01:34:15,829 --> 01:34:17,463
Mike?

1387
01:34:17,464 --> 01:34:20,490
I never cared much
for moonlit skies

1388
01:34:20,567 --> 01:34:23,934
Never winked back
at fireflies

1389
01:34:24,003 --> 01:34:27,200
But now that the stars
are in your eyes

1390
01:34:27,273 --> 01:34:30,572
I'm beginnin'
to see the light

1391
01:34:30,643 --> 01:34:34,807
And I never went in
for afterglow

1392
01:34:34,881 --> 01:34:38,248
Or candlelight
on the mistletoe

1393
01:34:38,318 --> 01:34:41,378
But now when you turn
the lamp down low

1394
01:34:41,454 --> 01:34:45,220
I'm beginnin'
to see the light

1395
01:34:45,291 --> 01:34:49,284
I used to ramble
through the park

1396
01:34:49,362 --> 01:34:52,798
Shadowboxin' in the dark

1397
01:34:52,866 --> 01:34:55,733
Then you came
and caused the spark

1398
01:34:55,802 --> 01:34:59,829
That's a four-alarm fire now

1399
01:34:59,906 --> 01:35:02,807
I never made love
by lantern shine

1400
01:35:02,876 --> 01:35:06,573
I never saw rainbows
in my wine

1401
01:35:06,646 --> 01:35:09,979
But now that your lips
are burnin' mine

1402
01:35:10,049 --> 01:35:13,541
I'm beginnin'
to see the light

1403
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:17,249
I never cared much
for moonlit skies

1404
01:35:17,323 --> 01:35:20,451
I never winked back
at fireflies

1405
01:35:20,527 --> 01:35:23,985
But now that the stars
are in your eyes

1406
01:35:24,063 --> 01:35:27,430
I'm beginnin'
to see the light

1407
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:31,095
And I never went in
for afterglow

1408
01:35:31,170 --> 01:35:34,901
Or candlelight
on the mistletoe

1409
01:35:34,974 --> 01:35:38,034
But now when you turn
the lamp down low

1410
01:35:38,111 --> 01:35:41,512
I'm beginnin'
to see the light

1411
01:35:41,581 --> 01:35:45,847
You know, I used to ramble
through the park

1412
01:35:45,919 --> 01:35:49,480
Shadowboxin' in the dark

1413
01:35:49,556 --> 01:35:52,582
Then you came
and lit that spark

1414
01:35:52,659 --> 01:35:55,685
That's a four-alarm fire now

1415
01:35:55,762 --> 01:35:59,755
And I never made love
by lantern shine

1416
01:35:59,832 --> 01:36:03,461
Never saw rainbows
in my wine

1417
01:36:03,536 --> 01:36:06,562
But now that your lips
are burnin' mine

1418
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:09,267
I'm beginnin'

1419
01:36:09,342 --> 01:36:12,641
Mm, to see the light
