- Okay, so what if l don't
want to give up on her?
- You don't call.

27
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:44,792
- You said l don't call if
l wanted to give up on her.
- Right.

28
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,930
- So l don't call either way.
- Right.

29
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:51,635
- So what's the difference?
- There is no difference right now.

30
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,770
See, Mike, the only difference
between giving up and not giving up...

31
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:57,474
is if you take her back
when she wants to come back.

32
00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:00,144
But you can't do anything
to make her want to come back.

33
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:03,279
ln fact, you can only do stuff
to make her not want to come back.

34
00:03:03,356 --> 00:03:07,190
So the only difference is
if l forget about her or just
pretend to forget about her.

35
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,127
- Right.
- Well, that sucks.

36
00:03:10,196 --> 00:03:12,859
Yeah, it sucks.

37
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:17,233
So it's like a retroactive
decision then? l mean, l
could, like, forget about her.

38
00:03:17,304 --> 00:03:20,637
And then when she comes back, make like
l just pretended to forget about her?

39
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:25,274
Right, although probably
more likely the opposite.

40
00:03:25,346 --> 00:03:27,281
What do you mean?

41
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:30,284
l mean, at first you're gonna pretend
to forget about her.

42
00:03:30,352 --> 00:03:32,786
Not call her,
l don't know, whatever.

43
00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:35,118
But then, eventually,
you really will forget about her.

44
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,591
- Well, unless she comes back first.
- Mm, see, that's the thing.

45
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,562
Somehow they know not to come back
until you really forget.

46
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:47,893
- There's the rub.
- There's the rub.

147
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,276
Back in their day, this place
was a real contender, but now
they'll appreciate the business.

148
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,438
They'll probably fall all over
themselves for a couple of
high-class guys like me and you.

149
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,948
- Now, we're not...
- You want to be fresh
on the scene, right?

150
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,713
The new places down on the strip,
now, those places are supposed to be it.

151
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:50,052
Oh, Mike, you don't want
all that fuckin' Pirate
of the Caribbean horseshit.

152
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,057
Or the rock and roll
grunge tip.

153
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,787
You know, guys like me and
you gotta kick it here. Old school.

154
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,125
Yeah, this is...
This is truly old school.

155
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:01,191
- [Trent] Definitely old school.
- This place is fuckin' dead.

156
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:03,794
You know, l'm gonna find me
two waitresses here
and l'm gonna pull me a Fredo.

157
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:06,066
- Yeah, well, they're all skanks.
- What are you talkin' about?

158
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,074
Look at all the
beautiful babies here.

159
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:11,134
The beautiful babies don't work
midnights to 6:00 on a... on a Wednesday.

160
00:10:11,212 --> 00:10:14,182
- This is the skank shift.
- Look at all the beautiful honeys here.

161
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:18,083
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me, darling. l want you
to remember this face here.

162
00:10:18,153 --> 00:10:22,021
This is the guy behind the guy
behind the guy.

163
00:10:24,026 --> 00:10:26,620
Okay.

164
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:29,324
Will you cut that shit out?

165
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,061
- What? She smiled.
- That's not cool, man.

166
00:10:32,135 --> 00:10:34,831
- Did she or did she not smile?
- lt doesn't matter.

167
00:10:34,904 --> 00:10:37,964
- Mike, l'm telling you,
girls love that stuff.
- You're gonna screw up our plan.

168
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:41,670
- Baby, we're gonna get laid.
- Could we first see what happens
when we play it cool?

169
00:10:41,744 --> 00:10:46,045
What do you think, Mike?
Do you think she's gonna leave us
and go tell her pit boss on us?

170
00:10:46,116 --> 00:10:48,050
Will you stop makin' fun,
all right?

171
00:10:48,118 --> 00:10:51,519
The trick is we gotta look
like we don't need the shit,
then they give us shit for free.

172
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:54,183
Right, right, right.
Well, l think you look great, man.

173
00:10:54,258 --> 00:10:57,285
l think l'm looking like the money,
like the bomb, right?

174
00:10:57,362 --> 00:11:01,025
All right, stop. See that? That, uh,
table? That's where we make our scene.

175
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:03,090
[Trent] You think
they'll notice me and you?

176
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:05,693
Oh, they're gonna notice me and you,
'cause they're watching.

177
00:11:05,837 --> 00:11:08,931
- Nicely done, sir.
You're on a streak now.
- lt's about time.

178
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:13,468
One of the best streaks
l've ever had. l wanna get even.

179
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:21,319
Uh, start with, uh,
l don't know, 300?

180
00:11:36,503 --> 00:11:39,563
l can count that
for you.

181
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,575
- On the table.
- Excuse me?

182
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:45,739
- You have to lay it on the table.
- l don't want to bet it all.

183
00:11:45,813 --> 00:11:47,747
You're not allowed
to hand me money, sir.

184
00:11:47,815 --> 00:11:51,012
You have to lay it on the table
if you want me to change it.

185
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:02,329
- Changing 300.
- [Man] Three hundred.

186
00:12:10,006 --> 00:12:13,635
- Do you have anything smaller?
- Yes, as a matter of fact, l do.

187
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,975
But this happens to be
a $100 minimum bet table.

188
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:19,641
Perhaps you'd be more comfortable
at one of our lower stakes tables.

189
00:12:21,585 --> 00:12:25,078
Okay, just tuck 'em under,
just like this.

190
00:12:25,156 --> 00:12:27,090
There you go.

191
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:30,352
[Woman]
Cocktails?

192
00:12:30,428 --> 00:12:32,555
Guy behind the guy.

193
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,996
l'll have a scotch
on the rocks, please.

194
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:37,728
Any scotch will do, as long
as it's not a blend, of course.

195
00:12:37,802 --> 00:12:40,738
Uh, single malt.
Glenlivet, Glenfiddich perhaps.

196
00:12:40,806 --> 00:12:42,831
Maybe a Glengow... Any Glen.

197
00:12:42,908 --> 00:12:45,342
Scotch on the rocks.

198
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:07,790
- Double down.
- What?

199
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:10,063
You got an 11.
You always double down on an 11.

200
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:12,196
l know, but it's $200.
lt's blood money.

201
00:13:12,272 --> 00:13:14,297
- Mike, you gotta double down.
- l can't double down.

202
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,400
- Mike, if you don't look like
you know what you're doing...
- Will you stop for a second?

203
00:13:16,477 --> 00:13:18,741
- Just shut up, okay? l can't.
- lf you don't look like you
know what you're doing...

204
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:20,712
Just stop for a second!

205
00:13:20,781 --> 00:13:23,273
[Arguing Continues]

206
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:25,148
Double down.

207
00:13:27,656 --> 00:13:30,022
That's nice.

208
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:32,025
[Trent]
Eighteen. Good. Eighteen's good.

209
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,627
[Dealer]
Twelve. Sixteen.

210
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:46,366
Twenty-one.

211
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:50,342
l'm telling you, baby,
you always double down on an 11.

212
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,507
- Well, obviously not always.
- Always, baby.

213
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,846
l'm just saying not
in this particular case.

214
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,853
- You always double...
- l lost, okay?
How could you say "always"?

215
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:02,187
- [Dealer] Lady has 11.
What would you like to do?
- Um, l hit.

216
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,957
- Fifteen.
- l don't know what to do here.

217
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,396
l'll hit again.

218
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:10,400
Seventeen.

219
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:14,963
Okay. l'll hit there. Okay.

220
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,803
- Twenty-one.
- Oh, my gosh! Twenty-one!

221
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,674
l got it!
Oh, my heavens. Thank you!

222
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:22,737
Whee!

223
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:25,613
Would you like to have some breakfast
this morning, ma'am?

224
00:14:25,684 --> 00:14:29,245
Oh, l really shouldn't. But then again,
it's a good idea. l'd love it.

225
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:31,482
- Thank you so much!
- Why not? By all means.

226
00:14:31,557 --> 00:14:33,491
- Take this ticket in with you
when you go in.
- Oh, thank you!

227
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:35,494
- They'll fix you up.
- You'll fix me up.

228
00:14:38,898 --> 00:14:42,231
That went plenty nice, baby.
You're up 20 bucks.

229
00:14:42,302 --> 00:14:44,827
You know, l mean not counting
what happened on the first table.

230
00:14:44,904 --> 00:14:47,099
- Thanks for clarifying that.
- l'm down too, Mike.

231
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:50,575
- Yeah? What'd you lose?
- l don't know what l dropped.

232
00:14:50,644 --> 00:14:53,010
Let's see, l dropped
probably 35 or...

233
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,345
Don't give me that shit. You know
exactly what you lost. What'd you drop?

234
00:14:56,417 --> 00:15:00,012
Twenty, all right? But l was
down at least fifty. l'm sorry.
l got lucky on the craps table.

235
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:02,783
You shouldn't be sorry.
You're a winner. l'm the fuckin' loser.

236
00:15:02,857 --> 00:15:05,122
- l'm the one who should be sorry.
- Baby, don't talk that way.

237
00:15:05,193 --> 00:15:07,286
Could we just go, please?
Could we go?

238
00:15:07,362 --> 00:15:09,296
Baby, look at me. Look at me.

239
00:15:09,364 --> 00:15:12,299
You're money. And you know what else?
You're a big winner tonight.

240
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:14,301
- l want to leave.
- You're a big winner.

241
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:17,133
l'm gonna ask you a simple question,
and l want you to listen to me.

242
00:15:17,205 --> 00:15:21,472
Who's the big winner
here tonight at the casino? Huh?

243
00:15:21,544 --> 00:15:24,035
- Mikey, that's who.
Mikey's the big winner.
- Okay.

244
00:15:24,113 --> 00:15:26,047
- Mikey wins.
- What a fuckin' asshole.

245
00:15:26,115 --> 00:15:28,982
Fine, l'm an asshole.
But you know what?
You're the big winner tonight, Mikey.

246
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:31,178
- You're the big winner
in more ways than one.
- There you two are.

247
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:34,656
l walked around for an hour
with that stupid scotch on my tray.

248
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,193
We got knocked out pretty fast.

249
00:15:37,261 --> 00:15:39,491
- Ah, a couple of
high rollers like yourself?
- Can you believe it?

250
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,895
- l'm gonna get you that scotch.
- You know, forget about it.

251
00:15:41,965 --> 00:15:44,559
- l didn't even want it.
l just wanted to order it.
- Can l get you something else?

252
00:15:44,635 --> 00:15:47,764
l mean, you really shouldn't leave
without getting something for free.

253
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,773
Why ruin a perfect night?

254
00:15:49,841 --> 00:15:52,833
Listen, um, bring a single-malted,
uh, Glengarry for me...

255
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:54,845
and one
for my boy Mikey here.

256
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:57,973
And if you tell the bartender
to go easy on the water,

257
00:15:58,049 --> 00:16:02,453
then this 50-cent piece has your
name written all over it, okay?

258
00:16:02,521 --> 00:16:04,785
l want you to run along,
'cause l'll be timing you.

259
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:09,385
l'm gonna keep time.
One, two, three, four.

260
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:12,794
- What an asshole.
- Baby, that was money.
Tell me that wasn't money.

261
00:16:12,865 --> 00:16:15,129
- That was so demeaning.
- She smiled, baby.

262
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:18,137
- l can't believe
what an asshole you are.
- No, baby, she smiled.

263
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:21,140
- She was smiling at
what an asshole you are.
- No, no, no, no, no.

264
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,802
- She was smiling at how money
l was, what l did with her.
- Could we get out of here?

265
00:16:23,877 --> 00:16:26,812
- l'm not gonna pay for a room.
- Mike, what the hell do you
want to get out of here for?

266
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,314
- The honey baby's
bringing us a cocktail.
- What, are you nuts?

267
00:16:29,382 --> 00:16:31,749
- You think she's coming back here?
- l know she's coming back.

268
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:34,754
Did you hear what she said?
"You shouldn't leave without
getting something for free."

269
00:16:34,822 --> 00:16:37,723
Baby, she wants to party.
She wants to.

270
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:39,726
l'm tired. We should just go.

271
00:16:39,794 --> 00:16:42,922
Baby, this is what we came for. Now, we
met a beautiful baby, and she likes you.

272
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:45,990
- She likes you.
- Whatever. Daddy's gonna
get her to bring a friend.

273
00:16:46,068 --> 00:16:49,231
Now, l don't care if l end up with her
or one of her beautiful baby friends.

274
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:55,140
lt's just l been... l been out
of the game for so long, man.

275
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:59,169
- lt's been like six years.
- Listen, it's hard, l know.
l been there myself.

276
00:16:59,248 --> 00:17:01,384
Not for six years or anything,
but l've been there.

277
00:17:01,384 --> 00:17:02,316
Not for six years or anything,
but l've been there.

278
00:17:02,385 --> 00:17:04,979
The best thing you can do
is just get back out there.

279
00:17:05,054 --> 00:17:09,115
lt's just l... l'm not attracted to them.
l keep thinking of my girlfriend.

280
00:17:09,191 --> 00:17:12,126
Then l'm trying to, like,
maintain a conversation with them.

281
00:17:12,194 --> 00:17:15,961
Mike, do you even think l know
what the hell they're saying
to me half the time?

282
00:17:16,032 --> 00:17:18,466
l don't know if they're talking
about how hard it is to be adopted...

283
00:17:18,535 --> 00:17:20,969
or how their dad
can't show 'em affection.

284
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:24,495
All l do, man, is stare at their mouth
and wrinkle my eyebrows,

285
00:17:24,574 --> 00:17:27,202
and somehow l turn out
to be a big sweetie, okay?

286
00:17:27,277 --> 00:17:30,805
Take this girl here.
She's a waitress in Las Vegas.

287
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:34,818
But l bet somewhere inside of her
there is a very, very special dream.

288
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:37,320
- And no matter how hard l try, l won't...
- [Waitress Clears Throat]

289
00:17:37,388 --> 00:17:40,221
Hey, there she is, the most
special lady in town, right?

290
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,657
- Yup.
- What time do you get off, uh, Christy?

291
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:44,662
- 6:00.
- 6:00, great.

292
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,097
- Two Glengarrys down,
easy on the water.
- Fantastic.

293
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,159
Uh, listen. Why don't you call a friend
and have her meet the three of us...

294
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,761
- at the Bamboo Lounge at 6:01?
- You got it.

295
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,899
- All right?
- Sure. Hey.

296
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,742
That was so fuckin' money.
That was like the Jedi mind shit.

297
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:05,614
See, that's what l'm trying to tell you,
baby. Girls love that kind of stuff.

298
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,653
They don't go
for the sensitive shit.

299
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,121
You start talking to 'em about, uh,
you know, puppy dogs and ice cream.

300
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:14,628
They know what you want to do.
What do you think?
You really think they don't know?

301
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:17,459
- No. l know.
- They know what you want,
baby. Believe me.

302
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:19,965
When you pretend it's just
like a waste of their time.

303
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:23,367
You're gonna take 'em
that way eventually, right?
Don't apologize for it.

304
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:27,340
lt's just that l get this thing
where l want to be a gentleman
and l wanna show respect.

305
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:29,934
Oh, Mike.
Respect, my ass.

306
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:32,036
What they respect is honesty.

307
00:18:32,113 --> 00:18:35,981
Look, you see how they dress
when they go out, right?
They want you to notice 'em.

308
00:18:36,051 --> 00:18:39,248
All you're doin' is letting
them know that it's working.
Get off this respect kick.

309
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:42,291
There's nothing wrong with letting
the girls know that you're money...

310
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:45,759
- and that you wanna party.
- You ready to order?

311
00:18:45,828 --> 00:18:48,854
Yeah. l'll have a coffee...
Two, uh, two coffees.

312
00:18:48,931 --> 00:18:51,559
And it says, uh, here,
"Breakfast anytime."

313
00:18:51,634 --> 00:18:54,000
That's right.

314
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:57,871
l'll have the, uh, pancakes and the,
uh, age of enlightenment, please.

315
00:18:57,941 --> 00:19:00,535
And for you?

316
00:19:00,611 --> 00:19:05,071
Oh, um, let's see,
l'll have the, um, the Toucan.

317
00:19:05,148 --> 00:19:07,673
- Over easy.
- l'll be back with the coffee.

318
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:09,946
All right, great.
Nice, baby.

319
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,285
Renaissance.
lt went over her head.

320
00:19:12,357 --> 00:19:14,951
l should have said renaissance.
Age of enlightenment. l...

321
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:19,292
Oh, God! Like a Las Vegas
waitress is gonna get an obscure
French philosophical reference?

322
00:19:19,364 --> 00:19:21,662
lt's like l'm trying
to show off to her.

323
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:24,600
l may as well have just said,
"Let me jump your ignorant bones."

324
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:27,138
Don't even sweat her.
We're gonna meet our honeys soon.

325
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:29,902
- You know Christy's friend
is gonna be money.
- lt's 20 to.

326
00:19:29,975 --> 00:19:33,308
- We gotta get out of here.
- Baby, will you relax
just for a minute here?

327
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:36,439
Excuse me. We have...
We're in a little bit of a hurry.

328
00:19:36,515 --> 00:19:38,449
Hang on, Voltaire.

329
00:19:50,497 --> 00:19:54,958
- l get paid for loving
- Hmm

330
00:19:55,036 --> 00:19:57,334
Loving all the time

331
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,532
[Chattering]

332
00:19:59,607 --> 00:20:01,541
- How're you doin', guys?
- Hey, boys.

333
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:04,169
- We almost gave up on you.
- l'm sorry we're late.

334
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,339
- There's, uh, no clocks
in this town anywhere.
- No harm done.

335
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,350
- This is Lisa.
- Hi.

336
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:11,852
- l'm sorry. l never got your name.
- l'm Mike.

337
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,354
- Mike.
- This is Trent. We call him Double Down.

338
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:16,357
- Trent.
- Stop right there.

339
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:19,189
- Ladies, don't you always
double down on an 11?
- Always.

340
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:21,195
- No matter what. Like splitting aces.
- Whatever.

341
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,892
- Hi, Lisa. l'm Trent.
lt's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

342
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:25,901
Lovely, uh, make-up job
you have there.

343
00:20:25,969 --> 00:20:28,665
- Oh. Uh, Lisa works at the MGM Grand.
- l'm a Dorothy.

344
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:31,536
Oh, Lisa's a Dorothy.
That's great. That's great.

345
00:20:33,142 --> 00:20:37,078
Well, we're not
in Kansas anymore.

346
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:44,387
So, uh, what do
you guys do?

347
00:20:44,455 --> 00:20:47,015
Well, l'm a comedian.

348
00:20:47,091 --> 00:20:49,525
[Laughs]

349
00:20:51,795 --> 00:20:55,323
Um, do you ever play out here?
l'd love to see you sometime.

350
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,334
- No.
- Why not?

351
00:20:57,402 --> 00:21:00,894
Well, there are, uh... You know,
it's just different circuits.

352
00:21:00,972 --> 00:21:03,907
- lt's hard to explain.
You wouldn't understand.
- Who's your booking agent?

353
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:06,809
[Panting]
She... She knows...

354
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:10,178
Actually, l don't have
West Coast representation as of yet.

355
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:12,945
Oh, who's your representation
back East?

356
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:17,183
l didn't... l sort of freelanced on
my own, kind of found my own things.

357
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:19,554
- 'Cause l...
- So what do you do, Trent?

358
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,595
- l'm a producer.
- Oh! Cool!

359
00:21:22,663 --> 00:21:24,597
[Whispers]
That's great.

360
00:21:24,665 --> 00:21:26,929
[Christy] l'm really
not supposed to drink here.

361
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,562
We should go someplace else.
How's my place?

362
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:33,868
- Yeah, that's great.
- Yeah?

363
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,876
- All right?
- Yeah, we... Yeah, sure.

364
00:21:36,944 --> 00:21:39,708
- Right.
- Because if you can't drink here...

365
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:41,715
- Then you can't drink.
- Why not?

366
00:21:41,783 --> 00:21:44,718
- That'll be great.
- Okay, great. Let's go.

367
00:21:44,852 --> 00:21:47,844
[Christy]
You were in Acapulco Beach?

368
00:21:47,922 --> 00:21:50,414
[Lisa]
We watch that all the time.

369
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:53,655
- No, no, no, no, wait.
- [Trent] Yeah, yeah.

370
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:57,495
The worst was when l went in for
this Afterschool Special, right?

371
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,796
So l'm sitting
in the waiting room,

372
00:21:59,868 --> 00:22:02,962
and there's all these little kids, uh,
sitting in the waiting room with me.

373
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:05,940
And l see that all the kids are signed
in for the exact same role as me.

374
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:08,910
- They're auditioning for
the same role as you?
- Right.

375
00:22:08,978 --> 00:22:13,176
So, uh, l check the time and the place.
l'm where l'm supposed to be.

376
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:17,083
l call my agent up. She says, "Trent,
they asked for you specifically."

377
00:22:17,153 --> 00:22:19,884
- What was the thing?
- l don't know what it was.
lt was "Drugs are Bad."

378
00:22:19,957 --> 00:22:22,687
"Jenny Eats Something." Whatever.
lt's Afterschool Special bullshit.

379
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,694
- Right. [Giggles]
- "Jenny Eats Something."

380
00:22:24,762 --> 00:22:28,528
The role l'm reading for is "brother."
l'm reading for the part of "brother."

381
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,124
Big brother
or little brother?

382
00:22:31,202 --> 00:22:34,366
- Just brother, man. Just brother.
- No.

383
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:37,203
Just brother, right? Finally l get
to go in and meet everyone, right?

384
00:22:37,275 --> 00:22:39,470
Mikey, l'm telling you,
l was money.

385
00:22:39,544 --> 00:22:41,739
lt's a starring role.
l practiced for a week.

386
00:22:41,813 --> 00:22:45,544
So l'm reading with the casting director
and, girls, l literally start crying.

387
00:22:45,617 --> 00:22:47,551
- No.
- l swear to God.

388
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:49,884
The casting director who's reading with
me kinda gets caught up in the vibe.

389
00:22:49,956 --> 00:22:51,890
- She starts crying.
- Oh!

390
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:54,722
- Yeah, l swear to God. Swear to God.
- Wow.

391
00:22:54,794 --> 00:22:57,820
So now she's crying.
l'm crying.

392
00:22:57,897 --> 00:23:01,731
We're both kinda crying, but not
the kind of crying that's like...

393
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:04,327
But the kind of crying that's
like we're trying not to cry.

394
00:23:04,404 --> 00:23:07,669
Do you know what l mean? Like we're not
trying to... Whatever. lt was very cool.

395
00:23:07,741 --> 00:23:10,471
So l finished reading with her.

396
00:23:10,544 --> 00:23:13,342
l finally hold up my finger,
like give me a minute here.

397
00:23:13,413 --> 00:23:15,347
- Right.
- [Choking Up] Like give me a minute.

398
00:23:15,415 --> 00:23:18,852
More than that, 'cause l'm in it.
But like l'm broke.

399
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,016
[Sobbing] Give me a second here.
May l have a minute?

400
00:23:23,091 --> 00:23:27,187
So l put down my head,
and the whole room sits in silence...

401
00:23:27,262 --> 00:23:29,196
for at least five minutes.

402
00:23:29,264 --> 00:23:31,198
- Swear to God, five minutes.
- Whoa!

403
00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:33,565
l look up, everyone
rips up in applause.

404
00:23:33,636 --> 00:23:37,367
The whole room is rip-roaring clapping
it up for me, for big T, right?

405
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:42,069
Everyone in the room is sitting
there tearing their face.
They're crying their eyes out.

406
00:23:42,144 --> 00:23:45,375
The guy working the camera, you know,
just filming it? Got tears in his eyes.

407
00:23:45,447 --> 00:23:48,383
- Not the camera guy.
- l swear to God, the camera guy.

408
00:23:48,451 --> 00:23:51,545
Not so much from my reading,
although it had a lot to do with it,

409
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:53,748
but, really, he had
his own things going on.

410
00:23:53,824 --> 00:23:56,292
So the producer
starts to talk to me.

411
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:59,157
He says, "Trent, when you
walked in this room,

412
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,994
l didn't see Trent Walker
come in here."

413
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:05,297
He said, "l saw big brother
come in here." Fuckin' great, right?

414
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:07,963
He says, "You walked in with the role,
you nailed it, you're great."

415
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,872
- So give me the fuckin' part.
- Exactly. Right?

416
00:24:10,942 --> 00:24:15,846
Then he says to me... He says,
"Trent, l gotta be honest with you.

417
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:20,010
l think that it might be that
you may be just a little bit old...

418
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:22,576
for the role of brother."

419
00:24:22,654 --> 00:24:25,179
So l felt confident,
'cause l gave a good read.

420
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:28,192
l say to him, "Well, how old exactly
is the role of brother?"

421
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,195
- [Mike] Here it comes.
- 'Cause l'm tall.

422
00:24:30,263 --> 00:24:32,697
- Here it comes.
- But l look young, Mike.
Do l look young, girls?

423
00:24:32,765 --> 00:24:34,790
Yeah, you do.

424
00:24:34,868 --> 00:24:37,860
So he says to me... l swear to God he
says this to me with a straight face.

425
00:24:37,937 --> 00:24:42,074
This fucking guy.

and we lasted for six years.

Well, yeah, but how long was the

her that much, to be honest.

She didn't really do it for me.

The whole Judy Garland thing

- All right. Count 'em up.
- How many strokes?

572
00:34:07,544 --> 00:34:09,876
One, two, three...

573
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:16,219
- Eight, nine.
- What'd you get?

574
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:18,721
- Eight or a nine.
- l'll give you an eight.

575
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:21,121
- What did you get?
- l got an eight.

576
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:24,560
Dead heat after one hole.
lt's turning into quite a rivalry.

577
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:28,157
You better replace the pin, Chi Chi.
The natives look restless.

578
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:32,063
- [Computer Game]
- [Man] You bitch! You bitch!

579
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:34,731
- [Trent] Chelios steals to Roenick.
- [All Groaning]

580
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,070
- [Trent] Money!
- Bitch!

581
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:39,236
[Mike] Sue, why is
Gretzky on his ass again?

582
00:34:39,312 --> 00:34:42,907
- Gretzky's a little bitch.
- God, this is such bullshit, man.
This is bullshit!

583
00:34:42,982 --> 00:34:45,780
[Mike] The Kings suck in this game.
You should play another team.

584
00:34:45,852 --> 00:34:49,253
- l took the Kings to the Cup.
- Yeah, against the computer
with the offsides off.

585
00:34:49,322 --> 00:34:52,416
- They're a finesse team, bro.
- They're a fuckin' bitch team.
Score... Oh!

586
00:34:52,492 --> 00:34:55,087
You bitch!
What a fuckin' bitch!

587
00:34:55,162 --> 00:34:57,221
- Watch out, motherfucker.
- No, you do not fuckin' hit my elbow.

588
00:34:57,298 --> 00:34:59,789
[Trent] lt's not even so much me
as it's Roenick. He's good.

589
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:01,732
[Sue]
Oh, is that right?

590
00:35:01,802 --> 00:35:04,270
- Chelios steals to Roenick.
- [Sue] You bitch!

591
00:35:04,338 --> 00:35:06,738
Score Chicago! Ohh!

592
00:35:06,807 --> 00:35:08,742
- That was pretty.
- Such fuckin' bullshit!

593
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:11,370
But that was pretty, Sue.
Check this out on the instant replay.

594
00:35:11,446 --> 00:35:13,812
- Dude, do not...
- You said it was fuckin' bullshit.
Check it out.

595
00:35:13,882 --> 00:35:16,680
- Look at it!
- [Both Arguing]

596
00:35:16,751 --> 00:35:18,685
- Look at it!
- l don't want to!

597
00:35:18,753 --> 00:35:21,813
Why do you think they put
the instant replay in the fucking game?

598
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,291
- God, you're unbelievable.
- So you can see if it's bullshit.

599
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,160
- l am unbelievable. Look at it.
- Every goal you're gonna watch
the instant replay?

600
00:35:28,231 --> 00:35:30,165
- Come on, man, l want to fuckin' play.
- l want him to learn it.

601
00:35:30,233 --> 00:35:32,224
- l never get to play.
- You should practice this
when l'm not here.

602
00:35:32,301 --> 00:35:34,735
- Just fuckin' move it.
- When l'm not here,
will you practice this?

603
00:35:34,804 --> 00:35:36,897
- Wa, wa, wa, wa.
- We'll play some more.
He likes to get scored on.

604
00:35:36,973 --> 00:35:39,067
- Set the game up.
- Great times.

605
00:35:39,142 --> 00:35:42,578
[Phone Ringing]

606
00:35:42,646 --> 00:35:44,739
- Yeah?
- Better play defense.

607
00:35:44,815 --> 00:35:47,909
Okay. Yeah, it's on the fourth floor.
The elevator's broken, okay?

608
00:35:47,985 --> 00:35:50,419
Dude, it's Pink Dot.
Would you buzz him in? Hit nine.

609
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:53,252
l wish they still had fights in
this game so l could bitch-slap Wayne.

610
00:35:53,324 --> 00:35:55,656
- They don't have fighting anymore?
- Doesn't that suck?

611
00:35:55,727 --> 00:35:58,059
Why'd they get rid of the fighting?
lt's the best part of the old version.

612
00:35:58,129 --> 00:36:00,154
Kids were hitting each other
or something, man.

613
00:36:00,231 --> 00:36:02,495
But you know what, Mike? You can
make their heads bleed on this one.

614
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:04,728
- Make somebody's head bleed.
- No, we're in play-offs.

615
00:36:04,802 --> 00:36:08,034
l'm gonna make Wayne Gretzky's head
bleed for super fan number 99 here.

616
00:36:08,107 --> 00:36:10,803
- [Doorbell Rings]
- Mikey, get the door?

617
00:36:10,876 --> 00:36:13,071
- Yeah, give me some money.
- Why do l have to give you money?

618
00:36:13,145 --> 00:36:15,909
Give me some fuckin' money.
l'm not paying again.

619
00:36:15,981 --> 00:36:18,677
Jesus Christ.
Pause the game.

620
00:36:18,751 --> 00:36:21,550
- Dude, l'm about to do
my thing with the thing.
- Pause the game!

621
00:36:21,621 --> 00:36:23,555
- l got fuckin' Wayne.
- Pause it!

622
00:36:23,623 --> 00:36:27,059
All right, l'll pause it.
Jesus Christ. Like you scored all day.

623
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,722
- How much do you want?
- Just give me some money.

624
00:36:30,797 --> 00:36:34,631
Okay, fine. Take my last 20.
Here. Jesus fucking Christ.

625
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:39,032
There it is, Mikey! Check it out.
His head's bleeding.

626
00:36:39,106 --> 00:36:42,200
Mikey, check it out. His legs... Little
Wayne's legs are shaking all over.

627
00:36:42,276 --> 00:36:45,643
- Fucking bitch!
What did you do that for?
- You're the fucking bitch!

628
00:36:45,713 --> 00:36:48,910
- What the fuck are you...
Why did you un-pause it?
- Come on, man.

629
00:36:48,983 --> 00:36:51,578
- C'mon, peaches.
- Get the fuck off me.

- You know what?
Look at you. Look at you.

631
00:36:54,323 --> 00:36:56,382
- You wanna kiss me. Look at you.
- Get the fuck off.

632
00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:58,392
- Get off!
- Look at you right now.

633
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,122
- Get the fuck off me!
- You're fuckin' makin' me sick!
You want to kiss me!

634
00:37:01,196 --> 00:37:05,463
Hey, hold still. Hold on. lt's
the fuckin' Pink Dot guy. Hold on.

635
00:37:05,535 --> 00:37:08,971
[Trent]
Hey, Mikey! Mikey, is he cute?

636
00:37:09,038 --> 00:37:12,064
- [Sue] ls he brown?
- Maybe he'd like to come in
and join us for a cocktail.

637
00:37:12,141 --> 00:37:14,075
- ls he polite?
- ls he a brown man?

638
00:37:14,143 --> 00:37:17,044
lf he's polite, have him come in. lf
he's polite, let him in. ls he clean?

639
00:37:17,113 --> 00:37:20,208
Have him come look.
Have him take off his shoes.

640
00:37:20,284 --> 00:37:22,548
Michael, is he clean?
l want to see him!

641
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:26,453
Michael, l want to see him.
Don't let him go! Don't let him go.

642
00:37:26,523 --> 00:37:29,048
Get off. l'm serious.
Don't fuckin' do that shit.

643
00:37:29,126 --> 00:37:32,391
Oh, he got away from us.
l'm sorry, Michael. Was he nice?

644
00:37:32,463 --> 00:37:37,561
You guys are assholes.
Eat, eat, you fuckin' jackals.

645
00:37:37,635 --> 00:37:39,796
- Oh, yeah.
- Nice.

646
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:42,237
- What time is the party tonight?
- lt starts at 8:00.

647
00:37:42,307 --> 00:37:44,901
- Everybody'll get there around 10:00.
- So, what, 11:00?

648
00:37:44,976 --> 00:37:47,171
- Midnight.
- Midnight.

649
00:37:47,245 --> 00:37:50,943
l'm gonna bring an old friend
from back home. He just moved out here.

650
00:37:51,016 --> 00:37:52,950
- Who, Rob?
- Yeah, you know him.

651
00:37:53,018 --> 00:37:55,452
Yeah, he's cool.
You'll like him. He's a rounder, Rob.

652
00:37:55,521 --> 00:37:57,751
- What does he do?
- Uh, he's trying to be an actor.

653
00:37:57,823 --> 00:38:00,087
- What a surprise.
- How novel.

654
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:03,687
[Rob]
So the party started at 8:00.

655
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:06,198
Why are we going
to a bar at 10:00?

656
00:38:06,266 --> 00:38:09,793
[Mike] To grab a drink before we meet
the guys for a bite at 11:00.

657
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,804
Where is this place?

658
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:15,672
For some reason the cool bars
in Hollywood have to be hard
to find and have no sign.

659
00:38:15,742 --> 00:38:18,371
lt's kind of like a speakeasy
kind of thing. lt's kinda cool.

660
00:38:18,446 --> 00:38:21,279
lt's like you're in on some
kind of secret, you know?

661
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:25,342
You tell a chick you been
someplace, it's like braggin'
that you know how to find it.

662
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,980
[Jazz]

663
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:31,149
[Continues]

664
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:40,135
- [Chattering]
- [Woman Laughing]

665
00:38:40,135 --> 00:38:42,729
Excuse me.

666
00:38:42,804 --> 00:38:45,602
Excuse me.

667
00:38:45,674 --> 00:38:48,439
Excuse me.

668
00:38:52,315 --> 00:38:55,250
l'll get a Dewars on the rocks.
What are you getting?

669
00:38:55,318 --> 00:38:58,253
- Uh, Budweiser.
- A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud.

670
00:38:58,321 --> 00:39:01,849
God, l can't believe
the women in this city.

671
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:05,725
lt's like the hottest one percent
from... from all over the world...

672
00:39:05,796 --> 00:39:07,730
come to our gene pool.

673
00:39:07,798 --> 00:39:09,732
Darwinism at its best.

674
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,769
- Yo, Mikey, what's up?
- Charles! How you doin', man?

675
00:39:12,836 --> 00:39:15,328
- Ah, you know, man. You know.
- You get that pilot?

676
00:39:15,406 --> 00:39:18,603
Nah, man. l know you didn't. Otherwise
you wouldn't be askin' me, right?

677
00:39:18,676 --> 00:39:22,043
- That shit wasn't funny anyway.
- Piece of shit.

678
00:39:22,113 --> 00:39:25,480
Charles, this is my friend Rob
from back East. He just moved out here.

679
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,484
- My pleasure.
- How you doin', man?

680
00:39:27,552 --> 00:39:29,885
This is Charles.
We went to network on a pilot.

681
00:39:29,955 --> 00:39:32,219
- Oh, yeah, l tested for one.
- A month ago.

682
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:35,783
- How'd your folks take it?
- Actually, l haven't heard
an official "no" yet.

683
00:39:35,861 --> 00:39:38,352
Oh, so you haven't
told them yet.

684
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:41,558
That's all right, man.
l still haven't told my folks
l didn't get Deep Space Nine.

685
00:39:41,634 --> 00:39:43,568
You figure they'd figure
it out by now, right?

686
00:39:43,636 --> 00:39:45,969
- But Moms keeps asking me.
- Boy, does it hurt when they ask.

687
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:48,269
l don't even tell them about
anything l'm close on anymore.

688
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:50,571
Not 'til you book it.
You know, you might get cut out.

689
00:39:50,644 --> 00:39:54,307
l'm considering taking
a part as Goofy.

690
00:39:54,381 --> 00:39:57,316
- Well, at least it's Disney, right?
- Yeah.

691
00:39:57,384 --> 00:40:00,411
Look, we're going to, uh,
we're going to this party in the hills.

692
00:40:00,488 --> 00:40:03,548
Some modeling agency. Beautiful babies.
You want to come with?

693
00:40:03,624 --> 00:40:06,286
Yeah, why not?
This place is dead anyway.

694
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,555
Let's go.

695
00:40:12,133 --> 00:40:14,432
No, no, no, no, no.
Now, you got to admit...

696
00:40:14,503 --> 00:40:16,994
that the Steadicam shot
in GoodFellas was the money.

697
00:40:17,072 --> 00:40:20,439
The basement of the... the restaurant,
the Copa in New York.

698
00:40:20,509 --> 00:40:23,444
- Through the kitchen, Mike.
- l heard it took them four days
to light that shot.

699
00:40:23,512 --> 00:40:25,446
[Rob] Four days?
l don't know about four days.

700
00:40:25,514 --> 00:40:27,608
- Well, that's what l heard.
- [Trent] They have
to hide all the lights.

701
00:40:27,684 --> 00:40:29,618
Jesus, that must've
cost a fortune.

702
00:40:29,686 --> 00:40:32,621
[Charles] That's nothing.
You know how much money my man
spent on that Vegas movie?

703
00:40:32,689 --> 00:40:34,623
[Mike] Wait. You gotta be nuts
to shoot in a casino.

704
00:40:34,691 --> 00:40:36,784
[Trent]
All right, ready. Mean Streets?

705
00:40:36,859 --> 00:40:40,022
- That's the dope.
- Dude, dude. Reservoir Dogs.

706
00:40:40,096 --> 00:40:42,122
- Oh, stop with that
fucking Reservoir Dogs.
- Which one?

707
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:44,759
The one right in the beginning where
they're walking in slow motion, man.

708
00:40:44,835 --> 00:40:46,962
How can you even
compare the two, man?

709
00:40:47,037 --> 00:40:49,631
Tarantino completely bites
everything from Scorsese.

710

is l saw how well you were doing,

and l figured if you could
make it, l could too.

She won't call
because you left.

Sometimes it still hurts.

You know how it is, man.
lt's like...

1117
01:08:56,941 --> 01:08:59,877
You wake up every day,
it hurts a little bit less,

1118
01:08:59,945 --> 01:09:03,073
then you wake up one day
and it doesn't hurt at all.

1119

And the funny thing is...

This is kinda weird,
but it's like...

1121

you almost miss that pain.

1122

You miss the pain?

1123
01:09:20,566 --> 01:09:23,831
Yeah, for the same reason
that you miss her.

1124

New York they made it sound...

1301
01:23:21,864 --> 01:23:26,631

1305
01:23:39,816 --> 01:23:43,752
Yeah, but entertainment law

- She was always my ex.

1429
01:31:41,163 --> 01:31:43,097
Yeah, right.

1430
01:31:44,935 --> 01:31:49,531
- You hung up with her?
- l wanted to take the other call.

1431
01:31:49,606 --> 01:31:52,074
- What'd she say when
you called her back?
- l didn't.

1432
01:31:54,845 --> 01:31:58,508
- You didn't call her back?
- No.

1433
01:31:58,583 --> 01:32:02,747
- Why not, Mike?
- lt didn't occur to me.

1434
01:32:04,589 --> 01:32:06,523
Didn't occur to you.

1435
01:32:06,591 --> 01:32:09,219
lt didn't.

1436
01:32:09,293 --> 01:32:14,061
You been, uh, tearing yourself
up about this girl for six months.

1437
01:32:15,134 --> 01:32:17,068
Didn't occur to you?

1438
01:32:18,837 --> 01:32:21,237
No.

1439
01:32:23,542 --> 01:32:26,375
Well, Michael, l'll bite.

1440
01:32:28,982 --> 01:32:33,749
You know, man, l didn't understand
it either. lt's all so hard.

1441
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:37,153
Then it hit me on the way over here,
you know, like a ton of bricks.

1442
01:32:37,223 --> 01:32:39,157
lt's just so simple.

1443
01:32:39,225 --> 01:32:41,819
- When you...
- Dude, dude, wait a second.

1444
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,992
l'm getting vibe like
in a really weird way here.

1445
01:32:50,838 --> 01:32:53,966
This girl's looking at me
like she knows me a little bit.

1446
01:32:54,041 --> 01:32:56,066
- You don't recognize her?
- Mike, l don't know.

1447
01:32:56,143 --> 01:32:59,170
l could've been out with Sue
one night drinking and told her
l was a race car driver.

1448
01:32:59,247 --> 01:33:02,876
No, l think l would
remember this girl.

1449
01:33:02,951 --> 01:33:07,354
l don't think l've ever met her before.
l would definitely remember this one.

1450
01:33:07,422 --> 01:33:11,257
She got a lot of confidence, man.
She's doing like...

1451
01:33:11,327 --> 01:33:14,785
- Wow. [Laughs]
- What's going...

1452
01:33:14,864 --> 01:33:17,162
Mike, stop, stop.
Stop, all right? Just stop.

1453
01:33:17,233 --> 01:33:19,633
She's playing a little game,
like a fun thing with me.

1454
01:33:19,702 --> 01:33:23,468
Come on, you little party girl.
That's it. Come on. Fun little games?

1455
01:33:23,539 --> 01:33:27,203
You want to play fun little games? Come
on, you nasty little, cute little baby.

1456
01:33:27,277 --> 01:33:31,145
- What are you doing?
- Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike.
Stop. Don't. Don't, don't.

1457
01:33:31,215 --> 01:33:33,979
She's smiling at me.
She's playing fun little baby games.

1458
01:33:34,051 --> 01:33:37,145
She don't know me. She doesn't
know my address. You know my address?

1459
01:33:37,221 --> 01:33:40,157
You little...
Oh, you... Hold on.

1460
01:33:40,225 --> 01:33:43,160
She's coming over, dude.
Play it cool. She's coming over.

1461
01:33:43,228 --> 01:33:46,857
She's like the wild loony.
But l threw, like, the great
vibe at her, the funny vibe.

1462
01:33:46,931 --> 01:33:49,058
- You'll see.
- [Babbling]

1463
01:33:49,134 --> 01:33:52,160
- Shit.
- Mommy's big boy.

1464
01:33:52,237 --> 01:33:55,105
We're going bye-bye now.
Yes, we're going bye-bye.

1465
01:33:55,174 --> 01:33:58,837
We're gonna go home,
gonna play with Daddy.

1466
01:34:07,019 --> 01:34:10,786
So, um, so you
called her up, right?

1467
01:34:10,857 --> 01:34:13,792
Or you didn't call her. Why didn't you
call her? You said you didn't call her.

1468
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:16,246
Why didn't you call her? Mike?

1469
01:34:16,379 --> 01:34:18,014
Mike?

1470
01:34:18,014 --> 01:34:21,040
l never cared much
for moonlit skies

1471
01:34:21,117 --> 01:34:24,485
Never winked back
at fireflies

1472
01:34:24,554 --> 01:34:27,751
But now that the stars
are in your eyes

1473
01:34:27,824 --> 01:34:31,123
l'm beginnin'
to see the light

1474
01:34:31,194 --> 01:34:35,358
And l never went in
for afterglow

1475
01:34:35,432 --> 01:34:38,800
Or candlelight
on the mistletoe

1476
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:41,930
But now when you turn
the lamp down low

1477
01:34:42,006 --> 01:34:45,772
l'm beginnin'
to see the light

1478
01:34:45,843 --> 01:34:49,836
l used to ramble
through the park

1479
01:34:49,914 --> 01:34:53,351
Shadowboxin' in the dark

1480
01:34:53,419 --> 01:34:56,286
Then you came
and caused the spark

1481
01:34:56,355 --> 01:35:00,382
That's a four-alarm fire now

1482
01:35:00,459 --> 01:35:03,360
l never made love
by lantern shine

1483
01:35:03,429 --> 01:35:07,126
l never saw rainbows
in my wine

1484
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:10,533
But now that your lips
are burnin' mine

1485
01:35:10,603 --> 01:35:14,095
l'm beginnin'
to see the light

1486
01:35:14,174 --> 01:35:17,803
l never cared much
for moonlit skies

1487
01:35:17,877 --> 01:35:21,005
l never winked back
at fireflies

1488
01:35:21,081 --> 01:35:24,540
But now that the stars
are in your eyes

1489
01:35:24,618 --> 01:35:27,985
l'm beginnin'
to see the light

1490
01:35:28,055 --> 01:35:31,650
And l never went in
for afterglow

1491
01:35:31,725 --> 01:35:35,456
Or candlelight
on the mistletoe

1492
01:35:35,529 --> 01:35:38,590
But now when you turn
the lamp down low

1493
01:35:38,667 --> 01:35:42,068
l'm beginnin'
to see the light

1494
01:35:42,137 --> 01:35:46,403
You know, l used to ramble
through the park

1495
01:35:46,475 --> 01:35:50,036
Shadowboxin' in the dark

1496
01:35:50,112 --> 01:35:53,139
Then you came
and lit that spark

1497
01:35:53,216 --> 01:35:56,242
That's a four-alarm fire now

1498
01:35:56,319 --> 01:36:00,312
And l never made love
by lantern shine

1499
01:36:00,389 --> 01:36:04,018
Never saw rainbows
in my wine

1500
01:36:04,093 --> 01:36:07,120
But now that your lips
are burnin' mine

1501
01:36:07,197 --> 01:36:09,825
l'm beginnin'

1502
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:13,199
Mm, to see the light
