1
00:01:38,593 --> 00:01:39,423
I will help you rightaway.

2
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:40,309
Okay ...

3
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,710
Curtains: open!

4
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,830
Air conditioning:!

5
00:02:19,193 --> 00:02:20,785
Dear, did you bring the wine?

6
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:23,063
Hm

7
00:02:25,193 --> 00:02:27,070
We still have so much to do.

8
00:02:27,753 --> 00:02:28,788
Like what?

9
00:02:28,953 --> 00:02:29,942
Come, help me dear.

10
00:02:30,353 --> 00:02:32,150
Shading device: open!

11
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:38,663
Actually, I wanted to go 
to the hairdresser.

12
00:02:44,673 --> 00:02:46,584
I'll go shower first.

13
00:02:49,673 --> 00:02:50,788
Everything okay?

14
00:02:51,913 --> 00:02:52,789
Yes.

15
00:03:20,753 --> 00:03:21,708
Which?

16
00:03:23,193 --> 00:03:24,103
That one!

17
00:03:25,753 --> 00:03:26,503
Oh...

18
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,949
Then don't ask me.

19
00:03:32,553 --> 00:03:34,703
Have you have packed my suit, ha?

20
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:35,982
Your blue suit.

21
00:03:36,073 --> 00:03:36,869
Mm.

22
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:39,266
You had said the dark suit.

23
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:41,150
I thought you meant the dark blue suit.

24
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,346
Yes, good.

25
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:45,348
You meant that, right?

26
00:03:45,753 --> 00:03:46,469
Yes.

27
00:03:54,913 --> 00:03:57,871
Hey, you relax, yes.

28
00:04:01,193 --> 00:04:02,672
You're wet.

29
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:09,311
Mom asked me to call her at noon today.

30
00:04:10,153 --> 00:04:10,869
Hm ..

31
00:04:14,673 --> 00:04:15,389
What then?

32
00:04:17,353 --> 00:04:18,422
You should ...

33
00:04:19,873 --> 00:04:22,023
But before Alexandra and uh ...

34
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:23,343
Timo!

35
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:26,113
Yes. Before Alexandra and Timo are here.

36
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,471
They probably won't come.

37
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:40,552
Of course they come.

38
00:05:45,353 --> 00:05:48,789
They took another look at our picture 
and forget to cancel.

39
00:05:48,993 --> 00:05:51,553
Stop it. They're just a little late.

40
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:11,142
Hello, Julian.

41
00:06:11,753 --> 00:06:12,868
Hey, hello.

42
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:17,821
Yes. Uh no, after the riding school
to the right.

43
00:06:18,793 --> 00:06:20,192
Yes, to the right.

44
00:06:21,073 --> 00:06:23,906
Okay, see you soon, yes.

45
00:06:31,793 --> 00:06:33,545
Hopefully, they look familiar,

46
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,824
the photos might be ten years old.

47
00:06:53,193 --> 00:06:54,069
Hello.

48
00:06:54,193 --> 00:06:54,943
Hello.

49
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:56,951
Julian? I'm Alex.

50
00:06:57,193 --> 00:06:57,953
Ah, hello.

51
00:06:57,953 --> 00:06:59,227
-- Diana.
- Alex.

52
00:06:59,873 --> 00:07:00,988
Beautiful house, folks!

53
00:07:01,113 --> 00:07:01,863
Yes, nice.

54
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:03,392
Have you found it right?

55
00:07:03,513 --> 00:07:04,832
Were the directions okay?

56
00:07:04,993 --> 00:07:07,302
Oh yes, great! Was good.

57
00:07:08,353 --> 00:07:09,672
Because you went wrong.

58
00:07:10,393 --> 00:07:12,304
Alex said, it was my fault.

59
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,513
Yes, I said your right hand.

60
00:07:13,513 --> 00:07:15,231
Where your thumb is on the left.

61
00:07:15,473 --> 00:07:17,191
Then I got confused.

62
00:07:17,913 --> 00:07:18,550
Yes.

63
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:20,589
Let me take the luggage.

64
00:07:22,353 --> 00:07:23,832
Can I help?

65
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:27,142
Nice house!

66
00:07:27,273 --> 00:07:29,946
Yes, belongs to my parents.

67
00:07:30,513 --> 00:07:33,186
They are on holiday for a couple 
of weeks, was it was no problem.

68
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:34,952
Such parents, I would like.

69
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:42,152
So, what do you want to eat tonight,
Meat or fish?

70
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:44,743
-- Fish of course.
-- Meat, of course!

71
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,188
Then eh, we'll start tonight with fish.

72
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:49,785
Meat ...

73
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:53,826
And tomorrow, there is meat.

74
00:07:53,953 --> 00:07:55,227
-- Very good.
-- Yes.

75
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,542
I start already.

76
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:02,263
Well, so ...

77
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:06,985
And what are you doing again 
professionally, Julian?

78
00:08:08,313 --> 00:08:10,508
Uh, I'm in the financial sector.

79
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,512
I'm investment adviser.

80
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,265
There you have much responsibility.

81
00:08:14,753 --> 00:08:16,550
Yes! That's true. I eh ..

82
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:18,385
Is it not frustrating?

83
00:08:18,473 --> 00:08:20,429
To work with other people's money?

84
00:08:21,993 --> 00:08:24,507
Hm, not really ...

85
00:08:25,753 --> 00:08:27,072
Timo is internist.

86
00:08:28,433 --> 00:08:29,866
In the Radbout clinic.

87
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:38,786
You probably make long hours.

88
00:08:44,113 --> 00:08:44,829
Julian!

89
00:08:44,913 --> 00:08:46,824
Yes! I come!

90
00:08:49,313 --> 00:08:50,268
What is it?

91
00:08:51,513 --> 00:08:52,389
Arrange the snacks

92
00:08:52,473 --> 00:08:54,270
and see whether 
they have enough to drink.

93
00:08:54,353 --> 00:08:55,149
Yes.

94
00:09:05,193 --> 00:09:06,148
How is it going?

95
00:09:07,753 --> 00:09:10,392
Good! Cozy.

96
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:15,667
Diana, I recognized her from the photo,
but not you.

97
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:18,831
Oh. How come?

98
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:21,625
You look just different.

99
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,503
You both look just like in the picture.

100
00:09:26,313 --> 00:09:28,144
And this is really 
the first time for you?

101
00:09:28,673 --> 00:09:29,310
Yes.

102
00:09:29,553 --> 00:09:30,702
-- Yes.

103
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,705
I´m pretty nervous about it.

104
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,710
So then: Welcome to the club!

105
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,228
I can hardly remember our first time.

106
00:09:38,753 --> 00:09:40,232
It's so long ago.

107
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:44,272
I completely forgot the pretzels! 
Sorry.

108
00:10:03,273 --> 00:10:05,025
Nice skirt you´re wearing.

109
00:10:05,753 --> 00:10:07,106
It's nothing special.

110
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:09,112
Suits you well.

111
00:10:09,753 --> 00:10:10,629
Thank you.

112
00:10:11,753 --> 00:10:13,186
You have a good figure.

113
00:10:31,153 --> 00:10:33,064
I don't make you nervous, I hope!

114
00:10:37,673 --> 00:10:38,822
Where is the toilet?

115
00:10:43,713 --> 00:10:44,987
Uh, down the hall.

116
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:46,743
Thank you.

117
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:25,187
Very cozy here.

118
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:26,263
Yes, is it not?

119
00:11:27,073 --> 00:11:29,143
The best parties 
always end up in the kitchen.

120
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,831
Yes, but now you're in the way.

121
00:11:31,313 --> 00:11:34,225
Just leave that. We'll do it later.

122
00:11:34,873 --> 00:11:36,226
May I read your hand?

123
00:11:36,713 --> 00:11:38,749
Don´t tell me you believe that.

124
00:11:38,873 --> 00:11:39,669
I do.

125
00:11:41,513 --> 00:11:43,629
Hands tell a lot about the people.

126
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,869
That sounds great, 
but I don't believe it.

127
00:11:45,953 --> 00:11:46,913
Come on...

128
00:11:46,913 --> 00:11:50,952
Well ... People are how they're 
educated and shaped by their genes.

129
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:54,106
Hand lines, stars, 
tea leaves, whatever,

130
00:11:54,193 --> 00:11:55,592
have nothing to do with it.

131
00:11:56,953 --> 00:12:00,787
Life is only about two things.
Power and love.

132
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,588
How do you see that?

133
00:12:05,673 --> 00:12:07,868
I recognize quite clearly
you're caring.

134
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:10,261
A quiet person.

135
00:12:10,393 --> 00:12:13,465
A suppressed desire.

136
00:12:16,273 --> 00:12:17,422
Cancer, it certainly is.

137
00:12:17,513 --> 00:12:18,343
Yes!

138
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:23,662
You judge yourself according to 
the standards of others.

139
00:12:24,113 --> 00:12:25,865
And struggle with something.

140
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,664
Alex, please let us eat.

141
00:12:32,193 --> 00:12:33,672
What could it be?

142
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,311
Alexandra!

143
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:44,382
Bon appetit.

144
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:45,784
Yes.

145
00:12:48,193 --> 00:12:50,991
Uh, music? Suggestions?

146
00:12:52,153 --> 00:12:53,711
I just guessed.

147
00:12:54,313 --> 00:12:55,462
l hope it tastes good.

148
00:12:58,273 --> 00:12:59,991
And now I would only say,

149
00:13:00,073 --> 00:13:01,745
that I find it very cozy here.

150
00:13:02,113 --> 00:13:03,751
Well done.

151
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:06,151
Diana, the fish looks great.

152
00:13:09,993 --> 00:13:13,110
Hm, so Julian made the decision?

153
00:13:14,113 --> 00:13:15,751
Yes, more or less.

154
00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:18,509
We already contrived about it.

155
00:13:18,953 --> 00:13:20,944
Yes, it usually starts that way.

156
00:13:21,073 --> 00:13:22,506
What usually begins so?

157
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,061
Usually it's the man 
who proposes such thing.

158
00:13:26,353 --> 00:13:29,550
Women show their sexual fantasies
less easy than men.

159
00:13:29,673 --> 00:13:30,662
-- Yes, true.
-- Yes.

160
00:13:30,753 --> 00:13:31,708
No, this is nonsense.

161
00:13:31,793 --> 00:13:32,509
Ah, yes?

162
00:13:32,673 --> 00:13:34,948
Yes. l was recently in a bookstore,

163
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:37,708
looking at women's magazines.

164
00:13:37,793 --> 00:13:39,909
Like the "Cosmo" and "Viva",

165
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:41,028
you name it.

166
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:44,822
And all the front pages scream 
SEX, SEX, SEX!

167
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,945
So, I think that you women
are keeping up with us men now.

168
00:13:48,353 --> 00:13:50,867
l really know a lot of people,
the so-educated.

169
00:13:50,953 --> 00:13:53,113
Most of my friends, for example,

170
00:13:53,113 --> 00:13:54,944
need a lot of attention 
on their erogenous spots,

171
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:56,785
before they dare one step further.

172
00:13:56,873 --> 00:13:58,545
You're a whole erogene zone.

173
00:13:58,633 --> 00:13:59,509
Yes, exactly!

174
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,504
l listen to my body,

175
00:14:01,593 --> 00:14:03,948
and if I get the respond from the other,

176
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:05,671
that could make me moist,

177
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:07,792
I go for it.

178
00:14:08,073 --> 00:14:10,268
Timo of course feels the same.

179
00:14:10,513 --> 00:14:12,981
Because we make everything
by common consent!

180
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:18,341
You see, its about trust,
communication and reflection!

181
00:14:18,793 --> 00:14:20,351
And you know what?

182
00:14:21,753 --> 00:14:24,506
l have never been so faithful.

183
00:14:25,353 --> 00:14:27,548
ln this context,
adultery isn't cheating!

184
00:14:37,513 --> 00:14:39,151
And while a fantastic making out

185
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:40,871
I made him hot,

186
00:14:40,953 --> 00:14:42,545
with a fictitious second wife.

187
00:14:43,193 --> 00:14:46,902
It caused right the physical 
reaction that I wanted to have.

188
00:14:49,953 --> 00:14:52,626
Finally I introduced him to 
a very good friend of mine,

189
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:54,905
with whom I've made love already.

190
00:14:56,593 --> 00:14:58,504
On his birthday!

191
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,791
This is a great gift!

192
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:06,662
It is a freedom 
that I do not want to give up.

193
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:14,703
Do you find that exiting?

194
00:15:15,953 --> 00:15:18,911
Two women who spoil you 
at the same time?

195
00:15:23,793 --> 00:15:25,067
Then let's do it.

196
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,225
No, I have nothing against children.

197
00:15:30,873 --> 00:15:32,386
I working with children.

198
00:15:32,913 --> 00:15:35,302
l often see that it goes wrong.

199
00:15:35,673 --> 00:15:37,231
The responsibility I do not want to have.

200
00:15:37,593 --> 00:15:39,231
And why should it go wrong with you?

201
00:15:40,913 --> 00:15:44,622
Maybe it's genetic,
whether you're a good mother.

202
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,222
We tell my parents,
we simply had no luck.

203
00:15:53,393 --> 00:15:55,065
This is the end of the discussion!

204
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,545
Your parents have given nothing to say.

205
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:59,544
You decide for yourself.

206
00:16:01,353 --> 00:16:03,913
Julian and Alexandra 
probably have more fun.

207
00:16:05,193 --> 00:16:07,707
I don't tell you whether 
you should take children ...

208
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:12,268
Get! You don't take children.

209
00:16:12,553 --> 00:16:13,702
Yes, sorry.

210
00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:15,432
That's what I meant.

211
00:16:17,113 --> 00:16:19,581
Listen, of course 
I don't know you so well,

212
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:22,062
but I see that you're patient,

213
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,063
sweet, caring.

214
00:16:25,993 --> 00:16:28,063
Well, those are the best conditions.

215
00:16:29,153 --> 00:16:30,905
Oh, that's sweetly said,

216
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:34,104
but no, you don't know me.

217
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:38,381
In addition, I would have
less time for Julian.

218
00:16:39,113 --> 00:16:41,104
Our relationship is going great,

219
00:16:41,953 --> 00:16:43,864
I don't want to gage that.

220
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,267
What makes you think you don't 
gage with this date?

221
00:16:52,873 --> 00:16:53,513
Yes ...

222
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,423
Or do you?

223
00:16:54,753 --> 00:16:55,629
Sometimes.

224
00:16:55,713 --> 00:16:56,304
Yes?

225
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:56,990
Hmhm.

226
00:16:57,073 --> 00:16:58,825
Dear, can you give me a hand?

227
00:16:58,913 --> 00:16:59,584
Hm?

228
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,581
Can you give me a hand?

229
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:03,582
Now?

230
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:15,903
What's up?

231
00:17:16,793 --> 00:17:17,782
I'm in the mood.

232
00:17:19,593 --> 00:17:21,106
It is not the time yet.

233
00:17:21,793 --> 00:17:23,146
At least not for Diana.

234
00:17:23,713 --> 00:17:24,782
Do you think so?

235
00:17:26,073 --> 00:17:27,062
Yes, something is with her.

236
00:17:27,153 --> 00:17:28,063
l do not know exactly what,

237
00:17:28,153 --> 00:17:29,745
but I believe she is not yet ready.

238
00:17:33,313 --> 00:17:34,541
l'll talk with her.

239
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:38,582
Please pour me something again.

240
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,433
You know they don't like smoking.

241
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:42,786
Dear, we sit at the fireplace.

242
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:44,792
The smoke moves directly.

243
00:17:48,273 --> 00:17:49,945
A wine for Madame.

244
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:57,910
Gosh, we do not have enough wine here.

245
00:17:58,873 --> 00:18:00,022
Dear.

246
00:18:05,353 --> 00:18:07,389
Try to enjoy a little more.

247
00:18:09,753 --> 00:18:10,868
You're right.

248
00:18:13,753 --> 00:18:15,232
She is pretty, isn't she?

249
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:21,544
Yes. And you too.

250
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:25,427
How shall we do this?

251
00:18:27,793 --> 00:18:29,146
l do not know.

252
00:18:29,353 --> 00:18:30,422
Do not know.

253
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:34,064
We will see, okay?

254
00:18:34,353 --> 00:18:35,308
Sure.

255
00:18:36,353 --> 00:18:37,786
No obligations! Hm?

256
00:18:46,273 --> 00:18:47,342
Diana?

257
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,106
Hi.

258
00:18:51,353 --> 00:18:52,229
Yes, fine.

259
00:18:52,513 --> 00:18:54,231
Everything is under control.

260
00:18:55,793 --> 00:18:56,987
Yes, I know that.

261
00:18:57,433 --> 00:18:58,991
I am sorry that I did not...

262
00:18:59,113 --> 00:19:00,307
l have not forgotten you,

263
00:19:00,393 --> 00:19:02,349
We just had a lot to do today.

264
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,748
No, no one else here.

265
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,507
I have to hang.

266
00:19:12,593 --> 00:19:13,787
Julian is waiting for me.

267
00:19:19,513 --> 00:19:25,861
Timo. Beautiful here, isn't it?

268
00:19:31,513 --> 00:19:32,628
Am I no one else?

269
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:35,582
That was my mother.

270
00:19:35,873 --> 00:19:37,989
Sometimes she thinks I am still 16.

271
00:19:40,673 --> 00:19:42,026
For too long at home.

272
00:19:42,153 --> 00:19:43,791
Never rented a room?

273
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:47,830
My parents are very conservative.

274
00:19:48,673 --> 00:19:49,947
Single child, right?

275
00:19:52,113 --> 00:19:54,866
No, I have a sister.

276
00:19:55,673 --> 00:19:57,186
I haven't seen her in years.

277
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:58,383
Oh?

278
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:02,065
Karin, she ran away from home.

279
00:20:02,393 --> 00:20:03,792
Rented a room?

280
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,466
To Canada.

281
00:20:05,553 --> 00:20:07,066
Wow!

282
00:20:08,193 --> 00:20:09,546
She takes decisions!

283
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:12,549
Yes.

284
00:20:26,313 --> 00:20:28,383
No pressure on you both.

285
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,108
Only when you're ready for it.

286
00:20:32,993 --> 00:20:34,949
Playing cards can be cozy too.

287
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:39,341
Do you know the rules?

288
00:20:41,953 --> 00:20:43,591
Can't we play another game?

289
00:20:44,793 --> 00:20:45,828
Strip poker, or something?

290
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:49,106
Or without Strip Poker ...

291
00:20:50,513 --> 00:20:52,273
I don't know this game at all!

292
00:20:52,273 --> 00:20:53,786
Oh, no problem. It is easy!

293
00:20:55,873 --> 00:20:57,545
Does anyone like something to drink?

294
00:20:58,753 --> 00:20:59,629
Cola.

295
00:20:59,713 --> 00:21:00,589
Wine.

296
00:21:02,913 --> 00:21:04,505
Let me help.

297
00:21:11,793 --> 00:21:13,226
What are we doing wrong?

298
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:14,582
I do not know.

299
00:21:15,353 --> 00:21:16,786
They don't find us attractive.

300
00:21:16,873 --> 00:21:17,908
At least not me.

301
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:20,064
Ah, what makes you think so?

302
00:21:21,353 --> 00:21:22,991
Timo proposes to play cards!

303
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,711
And he is not bisexual, okay?

304
00:21:27,193 --> 00:21:29,070
They think simply that we do not want.

305
00:21:29,153 --> 00:21:30,984
Maybe you should relax a little more.

306
00:21:32,873 --> 00:21:34,625
Now, that's not fair.

307
00:21:35,113 --> 00:21:36,626
I feel fine.

308
00:21:37,313 --> 00:21:38,746
Just that phone call, so what!

309
00:21:41,113 --> 00:21:42,387
There's nothing wrong with them, you know.

310
00:21:45,913 --> 00:21:48,552
For them it's new, and you were 
nervous too at your first time.

311
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:49,509
I just don't want any emotional outbursts

312
00:21:49,593 --> 00:21:51,788
while we're playing poker.

313
00:21:52,793 --> 00:21:53,862
We will see, okay?

314
00:21:54,593 --> 00:21:55,992
Always such hustle with beginners.

315
00:21:57,673 --> 00:21:58,389
What?

316
00:21:58,473 --> 00:21:59,144
Nothing!

317
00:22:01,513 --> 00:22:04,425
The last bottle. We miscalculated.

318
00:22:05,593 --> 00:22:06,992
Uh, maybe something stronger?

319
00:22:07,273 --> 00:22:08,991
I really wished for wine.

320
00:22:09,713 --> 00:22:11,465
We still have juice, lemonade.

321
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,344
Is there a shop nearby?

322
00:22:16,393 --> 00:22:18,145
Yes, I could go to Evers.

323
00:22:18,233 --> 00:22:19,746
No, you've drunk.

324
00:22:20,753 --> 00:22:21,742
Timo has not.

325
00:22:24,193 --> 00:22:25,387
Then we can chat.

326
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,309
Let me go.

327
00:22:33,873 --> 00:22:38,071
Well okay, we'll be back 
in half hour, I guess.

328
00:22:38,553 --> 00:22:39,463
Ehm, requests?

329
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:40,863
Wine!

330
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,024
You could show that pool to Alex!

331
00:22:51,873 --> 00:22:52,988
Swimming pool?

332
00:22:56,273 --> 00:22:57,991
Jesus!

333
00:22:58,433 --> 00:23:01,152
Damn.

334
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:05,786
We also have a sauna.

335
00:23:06,513 --> 00:23:09,152
This house keeps surprising me.

336
00:23:09,673 --> 00:23:12,513
l would like to relax.

337
00:23:12,513 --> 00:23:13,787
You should as well.

338
00:23:14,673 --> 00:23:16,026
How do you switch it on?

339
00:23:20,873 --> 00:23:22,625
Let's see.

340
00:23:23,593 --> 00:23:25,709
There is also background noise.

341
00:23:25,793 --> 00:23:31,345
Ehm, forest, rain forest, ocean?

342
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,391
Sauna.

343
00:23:42,353 --> 00:23:43,468
Sorry.

344
00:23:45,113 --> 00:23:47,149
You do not need to apologize!

345
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:48,428
Undress yourself!

346
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:52,146
It takes a while.

347
00:24:01,513 --> 00:24:02,502
By the way ...

348
00:24:03,353 --> 00:24:04,502
at such a first time ..

349
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:06,348
Should it be great

350
00:24:06,433 --> 00:24:09,500
or does sometimes happens nothing 
on the first evening?

351
00:24:09,873 --> 00:24:12,671
Why? Doubts?

352
00:24:12,913 --> 00:24:14,187
No, but I can imagine

353
00:24:14,273 --> 00:24:15,501
that the tension is so big, that ..

354
00:24:16,273 --> 00:24:19,265
Yes, that you do not, you know.

355
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:22,673
It happend to me.
Do not worry.

356
00:24:22,673 --> 00:24:24,391
It's about the game, not the result.

357
00:24:26,273 --> 00:24:28,309
I immediately come to rest in the sauna.

358
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:32,987
And after that the cold dip.

359
00:24:33,753 --> 00:24:34,981
I always skip that.

360
00:24:37,633 --> 00:24:39,385
Say, what do your parents do?

361
00:24:39,473 --> 00:24:41,111
Or is your family rich?

362
00:24:48,673 --> 00:24:51,107
Did you never have trouble with swinging?

363
00:24:53,193 --> 00:24:55,070
No. Never.

364
00:25:02,873 --> 00:25:06,343
My father works at a 
multinational corporation.

365
00:25:07,513 --> 00:25:09,231
Commissioner-ships, such things.

366
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:13,266
This is his hobby.

367
00:25:14,753 --> 00:25:18,302
Architecture, garden architecture,

368
00:25:18,793 --> 00:25:23,309
interior design, architecture as a whole.

369
00:25:27,473 --> 00:25:29,464
So you are never jealous?

370
00:25:29,993 --> 00:25:30,903
No.

371
00:25:35,713 --> 00:25:37,305
We'll first see how that works.

372
00:25:38,593 --> 00:25:40,151
And how it goes.

373
00:25:41,353 --> 00:25:42,866
You're really doing great.

374
00:25:43,913 --> 00:25:45,505
For a moment I had the impression

375
00:25:45,593 --> 00:25:47,504
that you two didn't feel like it.

376
00:25:47,753 --> 00:25:51,462
Oh we do. We just don't want to push.

377
00:25:56,273 --> 00:25:57,342
What?

378
00:25:58,593 --> 00:26:00,185
Do you sometimes wear your hair loose?

379
00:26:03,193 --> 00:26:04,706
Never. No.

380
00:26:05,113 --> 00:26:06,228
Why not?

381
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,269
Do not know. It doesn't stay in shape.

382
00:26:12,073 --> 00:26:13,665
Timo fancies you.

383
00:26:16,473 --> 00:26:17,223
Oh?

384
00:26:20,673 --> 00:26:22,345
Me too, really.

385
00:26:25,513 --> 00:26:26,912
It is too hot for me here!

386
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,747
Your turn!

387
00:26:44,913 --> 00:26:45,868
Oh no!

388
00:26:45,953 --> 00:26:47,147
No, definitely not!

389
00:26:52,113 --> 00:26:53,341
Bitch!

390
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:57,631
Oh, you can't plunge here.

391
00:27:11,593 --> 00:27:12,867
Do you have your mobile phone here?

392
00:27:13,353 --> 00:27:15,230
No, it's in your hallway.

393
00:27:15,673 --> 00:27:17,186
Shit! The battery is empty.

394
00:27:17,273 --> 00:27:20,026
Do not worry. The girls are
amusing themselves.

395
00:27:22,513 --> 00:27:26,142
You know, I think it is not so bad.

396
00:27:26,433 --> 00:27:28,151
It's never sure, is it?

397
00:27:28,353 --> 00:27:29,388
Can you give me some light here?

398
00:27:35,793 --> 00:27:37,067
At such meetings,

399
00:27:37,153 --> 00:27:39,347
one might get into a fight.

400
00:27:40,433 --> 00:27:41,185


401
00:27:44,193 --> 00:27:45,706
How long have you been doing this?

402
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:49,025
About four years.

403
00:27:49,913 --> 00:27:51,266
Stimulating, isn't it?

404
00:27:51,993 --> 00:27:53,267
Stimulating?

405
00:27:53,553 --> 00:27:55,464
Well, it surely keeps 
your relationship stunning.

406
00:27:55,553 --> 00:27:56,986
You should not attempt this to stimulate

407
00:27:57,073 --> 00:27:59,303
your relationship, leave alone to save it.

408
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:04,351
Will you two really want this?

409
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:06,429
Sorry?

410
00:28:06,513 --> 00:28:08,743
Obviously I don't know you 
so well yet, but ...

411
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:11,028
Diana seems uncertain to me.

412
00:28:12,873 --> 00:28:14,591
Diana loves to

413
00:28:14,673 --> 00:28:16,311
and also finds it exciting.

414
00:28:16,593 --> 00:28:17,628
Just like me.

415
00:28:19,713 --> 00:28:21,863
And you? Do you two have 
a good feeling about this?

416
00:28:22,393 --> 00:28:24,384
You have to know what you're doing.

417
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:26,869
It would be a shame
if one joins in,

418
00:28:26,953 --> 00:28:28,705
because the other wants it so bad.

419
00:28:29,433 --> 00:28:31,071
We both really want it.

420
00:28:31,873 --> 00:28:32,783


421
00:28:37,913 --> 00:28:41,303
May I ask, if you're together,

422
00:28:42,793 --> 00:28:44,067
is it still exciting?

423
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:45,988
Yeah!

424
00:28:51,153 --> 00:28:53,144
Aha. Diana and I know
each other for over ten years

425
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:55,144
and I just got to know her desires.

426
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:59,306
So, you see how important it
is to talk and reflect.

427
00:29:00,513 --> 00:29:03,585
We always say:
keep reflecting.

428
00:29:05,873 --> 00:29:06,988
-- Reflect?
-- Yes.

429
00:29:08,993 --> 00:29:11,223
l suppose, it is an exciting idea for you,

430
00:29:11,313 --> 00:29:13,224
to fuck my Alex later on.

431
00:29:16,753 --> 00:29:18,266
Well, then you need to also ask how it is

432
00:29:18,353 --> 00:29:20,469
when I lay on your wife.

433
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:24,347
Everything has two sides!

434
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:30,669
And how many people visit such a club?

435
00:29:30,753 --> 00:29:33,142
At the weekend,
1000 people at least.

436
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:36,905
No. You're kidding! That many?

437
00:29:36,993 --> 00:29:37,869
Yes!

438
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:41,151
And what kind of people are they?

439
00:29:41,953 --> 00:29:44,183
Quite normal people like you and me.

440
00:29:44,353 --> 00:29:47,390
They are really not the blonde celebs.

441
00:29:47,873 --> 00:29:50,387
Most are between 25 and 35,

442
00:29:51,153 --> 00:29:52,950
often good looking.

443
00:29:53,033 --> 00:29:54,785
And you have to be dressed in lingerie?

444
00:29:54,913 --> 00:29:56,346
There is a dress code, yes ...

445
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,863
But actually it is about 
as the nudist beach.

446
00:30:00,193 --> 00:30:02,707
At first you look at it
and then forget it.

447
00:30:04,233 --> 00:30:06,033
You can have great sex,

448
00:30:06,033 --> 00:30:07,148
if you can put your mind to it.

449
00:30:09,113 --> 00:30:10,387
We will take you there one day.

450
00:30:13,193 --> 00:30:14,626
Diana is in many ways uncertain.

451
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:18,186
About her appearance,
well, about all, actually.

452
00:30:18,713 --> 00:30:19,941
But not about this.

453
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:21,227
This is something else.

454
00:30:22,753 --> 00:30:24,869
She is a very attractive woman.

455
00:30:27,753 --> 00:30:29,106
Different from Alex.

456
00:30:29,193 --> 00:30:30,546
Yes, very different.

457
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,226
Alex is wonderful.

458
00:30:37,473 --> 00:30:38,872
To the right, in a moment.

459
00:30:40,513 --> 00:30:42,344
Maybe that makes Diana uncertain.

460
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:44,423
What?

461
00:30:45,273 --> 00:30:46,069
Alex.

462
00:30:48,153 --> 00:30:50,621
Well. Women!

463
00:32:05,113 --> 00:32:06,671
Hello!

464
00:32:07,673 --> 00:32:09,743
That is just what I needed!

465
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:22,507
Welcome.

466
00:32:40,433 --> 00:32:45,029
Where is, no, no!

467
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:47,461
Yes!

468
00:33:02,393 --> 00:33:06,181
Just to enjoy for a moment.

469
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:23,786
You must have been doing something wrong. 
What a fantastic house is this.

470
00:33:24,313 --> 00:33:27,703
Yes, but I doubt if Diana's parents
are so happy.

471
00:33:27,793 --> 00:33:29,067
But you are.

472
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:30,342
Yes, that is true.

473
00:33:31,993 --> 00:33:33,221
As is so often the old cliché:

474
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:35,269
Money does not make happy.

475
00:33:36,993 --> 00:33:39,268
But a beautiful woman 
and a glass of good wine...

476
00:33:39,433 --> 00:33:42,072
Well, the wine. 4 euro?

477
00:33:42,393 --> 00:33:44,031
I fear the category "headache".

478
00:33:44,113 --> 00:33:46,069
Well, we will tomorrow morning.

479
00:33:56,073 --> 00:33:57,631
Are you really sure about this?

480
00:33:59,633 --> 00:34:00,509
Yes.

481
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,027
Are you coming with me?

482
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:15,232
Hello.

483
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:22,261
Hey.

484
00:34:33,033 --> 00:34:34,148
Well?

485
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:35,783
Will you come out?

486
00:34:36,233 --> 00:34:36,949
No!

487
00:34:37,113 --> 00:34:38,068
Come on!

488
00:34:40,553 --> 00:34:42,145
Will you come in?

489
00:35:26,873 --> 00:35:28,989
l wish I could stop the time,

490
00:35:30,793 --> 00:35:33,227
and I could hold this moment.

491
00:35:34,193 --> 00:35:36,000
That would not be good.

492
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:39,028
You would you miss everything 
that will happen.

493
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:46,145
Have you made up your mind?

494
00:35:47,433 --> 00:35:48,468
About what?

495
00:35:50,113 --> 00:35:51,228
About tonight?

496
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:54,785
Where do you want it?

497
00:35:55,233 --> 00:35:56,791
With Timo and with me?

498
00:35:57,393 --> 00:35:58,951
Did you talk about it?

499
00:36:02,513 --> 00:36:03,992
Well, not really but ...

500
00:36:04,113 --> 00:36:06,786
its's okay, right?

501
00:36:08,113 --> 00:36:13,631
Ah, yes, as far as I'm concerned.

502
00:36:15,753 --> 00:36:17,948
Timo! Still awake?

503
00:36:19,513 --> 00:36:20,628
Clearly awake.

504
00:36:21,273 --> 00:36:22,228
Wine?

505
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:24,632
I prefer something else.

506
00:40:02,353 --> 00:40:03,388
I have to go to the toilet. Right back.

507
00:40:03,473 --> 00:40:04,462


508
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:55,391
Isn't he hot?

509
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:05,948
Jesus!

510
00:45:10,633 --> 00:45:11,907
Jesus Christ!

511
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:13,902
What happened?

512
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:17,546
Have you fallen?

513
00:45:19,433 --> 00:45:20,866
I'm sorry.

514
00:45:25,913 --> 00:45:27,744
Sweety, what is wrong with you?

515
00:45:37,793 --> 00:45:39,146
He slipped.

516
00:45:40,633 --> 00:45:41,827
Are you okay?

517
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,301
I'm sorry.

518
00:45:43,553 --> 00:45:44,952
Do you have bandage?

519
00:45:45,593 --> 00:45:47,345
Uh, yes, I'll ask Diana.

520
00:46:02,433 --> 00:46:04,071
We leave tomorrow morning!

521
00:46:37,913 --> 00:46:41,906
Hey. I could not sleep.

522
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:43,502
Me neither.

523
00:46:47,073 --> 00:46:48,870
Still it's a beautiful evening.

524
00:46:50,353 --> 00:46:52,230
Do you still wish to hold the moment?

525
00:46:57,833 --> 00:46:59,266
Do you want to talk about it?

526
00:47:02,513 --> 00:47:04,629
Are you going to analyze me?

527
00:47:05,353 --> 00:47:06,183
You know, there's nothing.

528
00:47:06,273 --> 00:47:07,911
He wasn't feeling fine this morning.

529
00:47:13,113 --> 00:47:14,466
May I have some?

530
00:47:28,113 --> 00:47:28,863
What?

531
00:47:29,113 --> 00:47:30,990
I suddenly think about my parents.

532
00:47:34,353 --> 00:47:36,264
They would laugh so hard.

533
00:47:40,913 --> 00:47:43,666
Sometimes I'm so tired 
to be the decent girl.

534
00:47:44,113 --> 00:47:46,069
No, you're not decent any longer.

535
00:47:46,153 --> 00:47:49,828
No. I was not allowed anything 
in my childhood.

536
00:47:50,633 --> 00:47:52,351
What anything?

537
00:47:53,193 --> 00:47:54,342
No parties?

538
00:47:55,233 --> 00:47:56,348
No Make Up?

539
00:47:58,113 --> 00:47:59,671
No wine while eating?

540
00:48:00,473 --> 00:48:04,182
No. No nail polish, no pocket money,

541
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,471
no dance lessons, no friends,

542
00:48:08,033 --> 00:48:11,548
No movies, no jeans.

543
00:48:11,673 --> 00:48:15,905
Oh dear. Then you have to
catch up a lot.

544
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:19,190
Smoking weed, party, drinking, sex!

545
00:48:20,633 --> 00:48:22,589
Yes, now who analyzes who?

546
00:48:23,073 --> 00:48:24,142
What?

547
00:48:24,953 --> 00:48:26,147
Nothing.

548
00:48:30,473 --> 00:48:32,543
Do you think you know me already?

549
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:35,027
A bit of hand reading,

550
00:48:35,793 --> 00:48:38,227
some loose analyses and finished?

551
00:48:44,513 --> 00:48:46,151
Timo didn't fall.

552
00:48:55,273 --> 00:48:56,547
Hey ...

553
00:48:59,433 --> 00:49:01,788
I had a nice time tonight.

554
00:49:03,953 --> 00:49:05,147
I thank you.

555
00:49:18,753 --> 00:49:20,630
I hope you both will agree on it.

556
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:37,462
Dimwit.

557
00:49:52,553 --> 00:49:53,542
What's up?

558
00:50:14,393 --> 00:50:15,462
Hey.

559
00:50:16,953 --> 00:50:17,908
Hey!

560
00:50:20,353 --> 00:50:21,627
Let us sleep.

561
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:26,349
Tomorrow is a long day. Hm?

562
00:50:29,073 --> 00:50:29,983
Good night.

563
00:50:30,473 --> 00:50:31,622
Good night.

564
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:48,788
- Is this house bought?
- Yes.

565
00:50:49,153 --> 00:50:50,188
Okay.

566
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:44,583
Hey.

567
00:53:44,673 --> 00:53:45,662
You are but early on.

568
00:53:45,753 --> 00:53:46,583
You too!

569
00:53:47,233 --> 00:53:48,143
Would you like tea?

570
00:53:48,273 --> 00:53:49,626
No. Coffee.

571
00:53:51,073 --> 00:53:52,631
I wanted to serve you breakfast on bed.

572
00:53:52,713 --> 00:53:53,702
Oh?

573
00:53:55,753 --> 00:53:57,744
Should I bring Timo a cup of tea?

574
00:53:58,793 --> 00:54:00,146
No, for him coffee too.

575
00:54:00,473 --> 00:54:01,622
With a lot of sugar.

576
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:08,982
Oh, ah.

577
00:54:09,753 --> 00:54:11,983
He is in the small 
room opposite the stairs.

578
00:54:16,593 --> 00:54:18,231
We go after breakfast.

579
00:55:10,953 --> 00:55:12,227
Good morning.

580
00:55:12,553 --> 00:55:14,066
Hey, good morning.

581
00:55:14,913 --> 00:55:16,062
Do you come in?

582
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:18,061
No.

583
00:55:27,153 --> 00:55:28,586
Have you slept well?

584
00:55:28,953 --> 00:55:29,783
Yes!

585
00:55:31,233 --> 00:55:33,513
You took the small room,
I've seen.

586
00:55:33,513 --> 00:55:34,628
Yes, if I was not doing well,

587
00:55:34,713 --> 00:55:35,782
I wish be alone.

588
00:55:37,713 --> 00:55:39,305
It was formerly your room, right?

589
00:55:39,553 --> 00:55:40,463
Yes.

590
00:55:40,913 --> 00:55:43,302
My parents like to keep it that way.

591
00:55:44,713 --> 00:55:46,465
Are you doing a bit better again?

592
00:55:47,073 --> 00:55:49,029
Yes, I do not know what happened 
yesterday evening.

593
00:55:49,113 --> 00:55:52,150
I suddenly felt bad and I
didn't want to disturb you.

594
00:55:53,313 --> 00:55:54,462
Was it still cozy?

595
00:55:56,793 --> 00:55:58,146
Yes.

596
00:56:01,593 --> 00:56:02,593
Coffee?

597
00:56:02,593 --> 00:56:03,548
Yes.

598
00:56:03,913 --> 00:56:05,141
How is your hand?

599
00:56:05,313 --> 00:56:07,349
Ah, a little stiff, but it will be fine.

600
00:56:15,273 --> 00:56:18,982
Ah, that has done well.

601
00:56:19,073 --> 00:56:21,143
You did not have to wait 
too long for me, right?

602
00:56:21,593 --> 00:56:22,946
I get changed.

603
00:56:23,033 --> 00:56:23,863
Hey!

604
00:56:25,273 --> 00:56:26,626
Are you coming?

605
00:56:27,353 --> 00:56:28,342
I'm hungry.

606
00:56:37,633 --> 00:56:38,907
What is today on the program?

607
00:56:39,193 --> 00:56:40,421
A forest walk?

608
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:43,063
Kröller-Müller has a 
new museum exhibition.

609
00:56:43,153 --> 00:56:44,347
I'd like that too.

610
00:56:44,913 --> 00:56:46,187
Or walk on the beach.

611
00:56:46,273 --> 00:56:48,548
Yes, if we need to drive for two hours, 
I'll get some coffee again.

612
00:56:54,193 --> 00:56:56,000
How is your hand?

613
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:56,999
Oh...

614
00:56:57,113 --> 00:56:59,069
You should get a look at it.

615
00:56:59,233 --> 00:57:00,507
He is a doctor!

616
00:57:00,593 --> 00:57:01,469
Timo!

617
00:57:02,233 --> 00:57:03,063
Yes?

618
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:04,627
Could you come here?

619
00:57:14,113 --> 00:57:15,512
Well, nothing will happen.

620
00:57:16,513 --> 00:57:17,628
Why?

621
00:57:18,713 --> 00:57:20,544
Oh please, don't act so dumb.

622
00:57:20,913 --> 00:57:22,551
Can't you see what's between them?

623
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:24,542
What?

624
00:57:27,113 --> 00:57:28,466


625
00:57:28,913 --> 00:57:30,471
Yes, what?

626
00:57:32,433 --> 00:57:34,230
Do you want to stay another night here?

627
00:57:38,673 --> 00:57:40,026
We must talk to each other.

628
00:57:40,113 --> 00:57:41,068
But not here!

629
00:57:41,433 --> 00:57:42,752
Why not here?

630
00:57:46,113 --> 00:57:48,308
If it is not with you on sex, you're out!

631
00:57:52,113 --> 00:57:55,662
Oh, so you want build 
a real friendship here?

632
00:57:56,273 --> 00:57:58,104
That is what all our ads say,

633
00:57:59,353 --> 00:58:01,503
FRIENDSHIP, in which sex
can be an enrichment?

634
00:58:01,593 --> 00:58:02,230
Nonsense!

635
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:03,541
If I say white, you say black!

636
00:58:03,633 --> 00:58:05,305
If I say black, you say white!

637
00:58:05,473 --> 00:58:06,701
What a crap!

638
00:58:06,793 --> 00:58:07,953
You do not take me seriously.

639
00:58:07,953 --> 00:58:09,864
You wonder why I don't 
take you seriously?

640
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:10,953
Then speak out for once!

641
00:58:10,953 --> 00:58:12,545
-- They can hear us
-- So what if.

642
00:58:24,233 --> 00:58:25,302


643
00:58:27,153 --> 00:58:28,586


644
00:58:28,673 --> 00:58:29,867
Do you see?

645
00:58:30,593 --> 00:58:32,345
I told you so.

646
00:58:33,873 --> 00:58:36,387
Shit. Should we do something?

647
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:38,631


648
00:58:39,753 --> 00:58:41,152
Call me when it is over.

649
00:58:41,433 --> 00:58:42,548
I'm gonna hit the shower.

650
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:44,550
Diana. Behave!

651
00:58:49,593 --> 00:58:50,628
Diana, Diana.

652
00:58:50,833 --> 00:58:51,902
Diana.

653
00:58:53,873 --> 00:58:55,465
Sorry for that.

654
00:58:56,593 --> 00:58:58,390
Yes, Timo and I, we ...

655
00:58:59,153 --> 00:59:01,428
Sometimes I just don't understand him...

656
00:59:02,673 --> 00:59:06,268
yes, then he can't go any good way

657
00:59:06,553 --> 00:59:08,669
and then I do not react very right.

658
00:59:10,033 --> 00:59:11,182
Sorry.

659
00:59:13,353 --> 00:59:14,627
Women, eh?

660
00:59:17,633 --> 00:59:20,147
Alex and I didn't have a great night.

661
00:59:22,673 --> 00:59:24,265
What happened yesterday?

662
00:59:25,313 --> 00:59:26,462
Nothing really.

663
00:59:27,753 --> 00:59:28,708
Nothing?

664
00:59:28,913 --> 00:59:30,141
Nothing what?

665
00:59:31,313 --> 00:59:33,383
I don't think this is the right moment.

666
00:59:33,673 --> 00:59:35,391
Since it was just between Alex and me.

667
00:59:36,953 --> 00:59:38,989
This agrument had nothing to do with you.

668
00:59:40,193 --> 00:59:42,229
I would have found it uncomfortable, 
if you'd think so.

669
00:59:42,673 --> 00:59:43,822
I mean ...

670
00:59:45,313 --> 00:59:46,712
I find you both great.

671
00:59:48,313 --> 00:59:49,666
I find you great.

672
00:59:52,753 --> 00:59:54,266
Yes, and ...

673
00:59:55,113 --> 00:59:59,664
The tension was too great yesterday ...

674
01:00:00,593 --> 01:00:01,787
and eh ..

675
01:00:03,673 --> 01:00:07,143
And then he's not, uh, you know.

676
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:11,630
He's bothered by it, sometimes.

677
01:00:15,433 --> 01:00:17,230
That's okay...

678
01:00:23,113 --> 01:00:24,307
I take the shower.

679
01:00:37,393 --> 01:00:38,508
It is because you can not change

680
01:00:39,433 --> 01:00:40,866
this is so.

681
01:00:42,193 --> 01:00:44,149
We can not change just ...

682
01:00:44,513 --> 01:00:46,071
so it no further.

683
01:00:46,153 --> 01:00:47,222
Do you understand?

684
01:00:48,873 --> 01:00:50,465
l have so often tries to
with you to talk about it.

685
01:00:54,793 --> 01:00:55,987
Why?

686
01:00:59,513 --> 01:01:00,866
Well!

687
01:01:05,673 --> 01:01:07,789
What shall we do today?

688
01:01:10,913 --> 01:01:13,950
Yes, I am curious!

689
01:01:15,513 --> 01:01:17,822
Forest, beach?

690
01:01:19,833 --> 01:01:21,471
We can also go swimming ..

691
01:01:21,593 --> 01:01:23,470
I don't think Diana will like that.

692
01:01:25,153 --> 01:01:26,871
Perhaps someone was here to invade,

693
01:01:26,953 --> 01:01:28,864
in order to avoid further damage?

694
01:01:29,273 --> 01:01:30,752
Julian, stay here.

695
01:01:30,913 --> 01:01:32,904
Let me go. It's my fault after all.

696
01:01:35,273 --> 01:01:36,422
He's good at it.

697
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:08,391
Leave me alone, sweety.

698
01:02:10,353 --> 01:02:11,547
May I come in?

699
01:02:13,753 --> 01:02:16,711
Sorry. l thought it would be Julian.

700
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:25,193
A real girls room.

701
01:02:25,193 --> 01:02:26,706
But I already saw that last night.

702
01:02:27,553 --> 01:02:29,225
Just like from the catalog.

703
01:02:33,433 --> 01:02:37,062
Diana, perhaps it wasn't a good idea

704
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:38,472
to come here.

705
01:02:40,753 --> 01:02:43,711
Yes, is a bit risky,

706
01:02:44,313 --> 01:02:46,269
if you have never met before.

707
01:02:48,673 --> 01:02:50,470
Such a blind date ...

708
01:02:51,273 --> 01:02:53,150
Oh no, it was not for you.

709
01:03:01,793 --> 01:03:03,306
It is this game.

710
01:03:10,033 --> 01:03:12,752
The first time we did this, Alex and me.

711
01:03:13,353 --> 01:03:14,752
That was her idea.

712
01:03:16,673 --> 01:03:18,033
She can be mandatory.

713
01:03:18,033 --> 01:03:19,261
Yes, quite.

714
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:23,186
But I fell for it.

715
01:03:23,273 --> 01:03:26,071
I fell for her determination 
and her reckless will.

716
01:03:29,713 --> 01:03:31,787
And if eh, if we had sex
with other people

717
01:03:31,873 --> 01:03:34,753
it was nice to still 
feel some connection.

718
01:03:34,753 --> 01:03:37,506
We had eye contact,
or hold hands,

719
01:03:37,593 --> 01:03:40,266
and had the feeling that 
we could conquer the world.

720
01:03:46,913 --> 01:03:48,631
How did you feel yesterday?

721
01:03:49,513 --> 01:03:56,146
Fine. Julian looked at me, 
and I felt good.

722
01:03:59,273 --> 01:04:00,388
That's nice.

723
01:04:03,393 --> 01:04:04,382
This is beautiful.

724
01:04:09,593 --> 01:04:10,946
You are beautiful.

725
01:04:16,713 --> 01:04:17,748
Delicate.

726
01:04:22,593 --> 01:04:23,992
You are so warm,

727
01:04:27,033 --> 01:04:28,307
so sweet,

728
01:04:34,273 --> 01:04:35,786
honest,

729
01:04:42,513 --> 01:04:43,866
so beautiful.

730
01:04:50,513 --> 01:04:52,151
Jesus, Alex!

731
01:04:55,033 --> 01:04:57,263
I just can't imagine it.

732
01:05:15,193 --> 01:05:16,751
You'll be fine.

733
01:05:20,953 --> 01:05:22,022
Do you think so?

734
01:05:31,473 --> 01:05:32,872
Maybe I should change.

735
01:05:35,353 --> 01:05:36,627
Is that possible?

736
01:05:36,713 --> 01:05:37,907
To change?

737
01:05:41,113 --> 01:05:44,628
Yes. It is!

738
01:05:49,633 --> 01:05:51,863
Well, do you have plans for tonight?

739
01:05:53,593 --> 01:05:54,582
Are you sure?

740
01:05:54,713 --> 01:05:55,702
Oh yes.

741
01:05:55,793 --> 01:05:57,112
Timo gets itself again.

742
01:05:57,193 --> 01:05:58,421
Today is simply not his day.

743
01:06:02,113 --> 01:06:04,752
l found it very exciting 
yesterday evening.

744
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:10,103
Well, it was very special.

745
01:06:14,953 --> 01:06:16,784
We sometimes let each other free.

746
01:06:23,833 --> 01:06:24,948
Hm?

747
01:06:26,113 --> 01:06:27,546
I'll talk to him.

748
01:06:41,513 --> 01:06:42,468
Cute.

749
01:06:43,353 --> 01:06:44,468
Cute?

750
01:06:45,193 --> 01:06:48,265
Sweet. A sweet girl.

751
01:06:51,513 --> 01:06:52,741
And the glasses!

752
01:06:55,833 --> 01:06:57,232
It touches me.

753
01:07:02,353 --> 01:07:07,586
I kook at myself and I'm afraid.

754
01:07:10,713 --> 01:07:11,907
What?

755
01:07:14,153 --> 01:07:17,270
I'm no good, I'm ugly.

756
01:07:18,073 --> 01:07:19,267
Diana, this is nonsense.

757
01:07:20,433 --> 01:07:21,866
Of course it's nonsense.

758
01:07:24,153 --> 01:07:26,064
But I was a child!

759
01:07:29,033 --> 01:07:30,102
Karin.

760
01:07:32,633 --> 01:07:34,749
She looks angry.

761
01:07:36,193 --> 01:07:40,311
Angry is still better than sad.

762
01:07:42,313 --> 01:07:43,302
Yes.

763
01:07:47,513 --> 01:07:53,073
I think they didn't love me very much.

764
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:59,389
Can you imagine that if you see this?

765
01:08:02,433 --> 01:08:04,867
How can't you love this one?

766
01:08:24,993 --> 01:08:26,904
It's okay.

767
01:09:12,473 --> 01:09:16,148
Yes? No, Alex, a friend of the house.

768
01:09:18,753 --> 01:09:20,869
Shading device closes!

769
01:09:21,193 --> 01:09:22,945
Okay, I'll pass the message.

770
01:09:29,993 --> 01:09:32,507
Hey, will you come with me?

771
01:09:32,993 --> 01:09:33,709
Sorry?

772
01:09:33,793 --> 01:09:35,624
Make a ride, walk along the forest

773
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:37,192
Let everything. Come!

774
01:09:38,713 --> 01:09:40,305
And what about Diana and Timo?

775
01:09:40,393 --> 01:09:41,189
They don't feel like it.

776
01:09:41,273 --> 01:09:43,741
Diana takes a bath and
Timo reads a book on Kama Sutra.

777
01:10:00,953 --> 01:10:02,432
Mother Fuckers!

778
01:10:03,593 --> 01:10:05,106
Hey, hey, be careful ...

779
01:10:09,833 --> 01:10:11,232
Better this way?

780
01:10:12,953 --> 01:10:14,671
How did you become like this?

781
01:10:15,953 --> 01:10:17,306
Engendered at full moon?

782
01:10:17,393 --> 01:10:18,587
Scorpio, baby!

783
01:10:22,033 --> 01:10:23,352
Here we go!

784
01:10:26,433 --> 01:10:27,832
Oh God, no.

785
01:10:29,033 --> 01:10:30,307
No!

786
01:10:30,553 --> 01:10:31,702
But. Later you see that and say:

787
01:10:31,793 --> 01:10:33,067
"It wasn't half as bad."

788
01:10:36,113 --> 01:10:37,831
l do not want it!

789
01:10:40,633 --> 01:10:41,543
Moment.

790
01:10:42,313 --> 01:10:43,541
Look.

791
01:10:43,953 --> 01:10:44,908
Look.

792
01:10:47,233 --> 01:10:48,461
This is a beautiful picture.

793
01:10:50,113 --> 01:10:50,989
Well.

794
01:10:52,273 --> 01:10:53,308
Okay.

795
01:11:00,273 --> 01:11:03,310
Yes, fine.

796
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:17,710
Yes. That was beautiful.

797
01:12:55,033 --> 01:12:56,261
Calm.

798
01:13:27,073 --> 01:13:28,472
Do you trust Diana?

799
01:13:31,953 --> 01:13:33,147
Well...

800
01:13:33,633 --> 01:13:36,705
I saw Diana with Timo upstairs.

801
01:15:01,833 --> 01:15:02,629
Hey!

802
01:15:03,313 --> 01:15:04,109
Well!

803
01:15:04,193 --> 01:15:05,387
You stayed away for a long time.

804
01:15:05,753 --> 01:15:07,709
This is a beautiful area here.

805
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:09,471
Ja.Alex wanted to see the area,

806
01:15:09,553 --> 01:15:11,145
So I thought, I show it to her.

807
01:15:11,753 --> 01:15:13,152
We were in the forest.

808
01:15:13,553 --> 01:15:15,669
Yes, I hoped to see wild animals,

809
01:15:15,753 --> 01:15:16,663
but unfortunately.

810
01:15:16,753 --> 01:15:19,108
Maybe we should go back 
in the mating season.

811
01:15:23,433 --> 01:15:24,627
Something to drink, anyone?

812
01:15:25,113 --> 01:15:26,626
Give me something strong.

813
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:27,868
Bitter Lemon?

814
01:15:28,153 --> 01:15:29,029
Whisky.

815
01:15:29,753 --> 01:15:30,788
I still have tea.

816
01:15:31,033 --> 01:15:32,307
I drink the same as Timo.

817
01:15:36,513 --> 01:15:37,866
Was it nice?

818
01:15:40,353 --> 01:15:42,787
Diana and I amused ourselves anyway.

819
01:15:42,873 --> 01:15:44,272
-- Not true, Diana?
-- Yes.

820
01:15:44,833 --> 01:15:45,982
Yes.

821
01:15:47,953 --> 01:15:49,989
It shows how things can change.

822
01:15:51,033 --> 01:15:52,830
This morning we almost wanted to leave.

823
01:15:52,913 --> 01:15:54,824
Ah, because I had only bad mood.

824
01:15:57,473 --> 01:15:59,145
I beg your pardon, Diana,

825
01:15:59,233 --> 01:16:00,905
I was a little abrupt.

826
01:16:01,553 --> 01:16:03,350
I blame you for nothing.

827
01:16:04,273 --> 01:16:06,070
I think it's nice that you are still there.

828
01:16:07,273 --> 01:16:08,945
I feel heavenly!

829
01:16:25,593 --> 01:16:26,912
Can I help you?

830
01:16:27,073 --> 01:16:28,142
What?

831
01:16:28,753 --> 01:16:29,981
Are you okay?

832
01:16:30,673 --> 01:16:31,628
Yes.

833
01:16:37,833 --> 01:16:39,152
Will something happen after all?

834
01:16:39,753 --> 01:16:41,152
Tonight?

835
01:17:26,913 --> 01:17:28,471
You amuse yourself, don't you?

836
01:17:38,433 --> 01:17:41,186
Since we are comfortably at this table,

837
01:17:41,273 --> 01:17:43,992
I think this is the right moment 
to toast.

838
01:17:44,313 --> 01:17:45,985
On a fantastic weekend,

839
01:17:47,313 --> 01:17:49,543
and on the end of my Swinger-lifesyle.

840
01:17:53,113 --> 01:17:54,705
l made a decision.

841
01:17:55,673 --> 01:17:56,867
I quit it.

842
01:17:59,313 --> 01:18:00,268
What is this?

843
01:18:00,433 --> 01:18:02,583
l have now joined many years,

844
01:18:02,833 --> 01:18:06,303
your quest for passion and 
your insatiable desire for others,

845
01:18:07,273 --> 01:18:08,865
but I can't share you no more.

846
01:18:10,473 --> 01:18:11,701
Sorry, but I think,

847
01:18:11,793 --> 01:18:12,987
we shouldn't be a part in this?

848
01:18:13,273 --> 01:18:15,548
Because you are here 
I want to talk about it.

849
01:18:16,833 --> 01:18:17,948
I don't know what you're up to,

850
01:18:18,033 --> 01:18:19,432
but you go too far!

851
01:18:20,833 --> 01:18:22,186
I try to clarify,

852
01:18:22,273 --> 01:18:23,626
that I can't take it no longer.

853
01:18:25,273 --> 01:18:27,309
So you lied to me?

854
01:18:29,073 --> 01:18:32,270
And all the talks we had...

855
01:18:32,353 --> 01:18:36,028
with others? About what else did you lie?

856
01:18:36,713 --> 01:18:38,510
If you played a game for all these years,

857
01:18:38,593 --> 01:18:40,424
what else do you play?

858
01:18:40,513 --> 01:18:42,310
-- That is nonsense. You ...
-- Nonsense?

859
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:43,743
You misled me.

860
01:18:43,833 --> 01:18:46,063
Maybe you do that 
with other things as well.

861
01:18:47,113 --> 01:18:47,943
No, dear.

862
01:18:48,033 --> 01:18:49,751
Don't call me dear!

863
01:18:50,793 --> 01:18:51,669
I am sorry

864
01:18:51,753 --> 01:18:52,868
I don't wish to interfere,

865
01:18:52,953 --> 01:18:54,671
but I find it very unpleasant,
if you...

866
01:18:54,753 --> 01:18:56,664
Oh, Madame feels unpleasant!

867
01:18:56,913 --> 01:18:58,904
The whole weekend,
we listen to your hassle.

868
01:18:58,993 --> 01:19:00,506
Hey! Stop that!

869
01:19:01,033 --> 01:19:02,512
Jesus, Alex.

870
01:19:11,753 --> 01:19:13,630
Remain seated!

871
01:19:16,713 --> 01:19:19,352
No one leaves the table,
before I say so!

872
01:19:35,193 --> 01:19:37,104
Timo doesn't want it anymore.

873
01:19:38,513 --> 01:19:41,186
What do you want to do about it, Alex?
Force him?

874
01:19:42,873 --> 01:19:44,625
Maybe you should talk it out!

875
01:19:46,113 --> 01:19:47,592
You were so good at that.

876
01:19:57,873 --> 01:19:59,784
I don't like this anymore.

877
01:19:59,873 --> 01:20:01,465
What should I have said:

878
01:20:01,553 --> 01:20:03,145
"Dear, I do not want it anymore?"

879
01:20:03,233 --> 01:20:04,825
You would have continued anyway.

880
01:20:05,753 --> 01:20:07,186
We all see waht it means to you.

881
01:20:07,793 --> 01:20:09,385
What does it mean to me?

882
01:20:10,513 --> 01:20:12,902
That you need more than I can give you.

883
01:20:14,113 --> 01:20:15,626
You are an asshole.

884
01:20:17,113 --> 01:20:19,024
Now you act like it was my fault.

885
01:20:19,433 --> 01:20:21,389
This is not about fault.

886
01:20:24,993 --> 01:20:29,623
Alexandra, so you have no idea
you how much I loved you.

887
01:20:39,113 --> 01:20:41,149
When did this all start?

888
01:20:42,553 --> 01:20:43,952
A while ago.

889
01:20:45,033 --> 01:20:47,991
This weekend, especially this 
afternoon, the cup is full.

890
01:20:48,953 --> 01:20:51,342
You made a big effort 
to make something clear to me.

891
01:20:52,513 --> 01:20:55,550
But this afternoon, 
when you both were not there,

892
01:20:57,233 --> 01:21:00,270
I have discovered in Diana,
what vulnerability means.

893
01:21:01,873 --> 01:21:03,272
And that was very beautiful.

894
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:14,948
Shut up, you!

895
01:21:30,673 --> 01:21:32,186
Well...

896
01:22:14,993 --> 01:22:16,187
Alex?

897
01:22:20,753 --> 01:22:22,152
Alex?

898
01:22:31,393 --> 01:22:32,746
What kind of game is this?

899
01:22:33,113 --> 01:22:35,786
Will you sit in the car afterwards 
and laughing your butt off?

900
01:22:41,833 --> 01:22:43,107
Damn again!

901
01:22:49,153 --> 01:22:52,623
Your elucidation yesterday 
was more convincing, Timo.

902
01:22:54,833 --> 01:22:57,506
Your big mouth, and how it should be.

903
01:22:57,673 --> 01:23:03,987
Talk, reflect. Bunglers.

904
01:23:06,753 --> 01:23:08,709
Alex locked herself in.

905
01:23:08,793 --> 01:23:10,704
Oh, leave her there!

906
01:23:17,353 --> 01:23:18,786
Alexandra!

907
01:23:23,953 --> 01:23:25,705
Pack your things. We're going.

908
01:23:35,593 --> 01:23:39,825
Alex? l am alone.

909
01:23:40,553 --> 01:23:42,145
Can I come in?

910
01:24:22,513 --> 01:24:24,344
He will heave to.

911
01:24:26,753 --> 01:24:27,868
He always act this way.

912
01:24:29,313 --> 01:24:30,712
He will heave to.

913
01:24:34,913 --> 01:24:39,384
Well, if not, 
then I will just find someone else.

914
01:24:42,633 --> 01:24:44,544
What is he thinking?

915
01:24:50,193 --> 01:24:53,902
Really, in my notebook are a lot of

916
01:24:56,233 --> 01:24:59,748
names of men who like to substitute him.

917
01:25:15,673 --> 01:25:17,629
What should I do?

918
01:25:19,793 --> 01:25:21,670
I don't know anymore.

919
01:25:47,753 --> 01:25:49,425
I fear.

920
01:26:12,273 --> 01:26:13,911
Thank you.

921
01:26:18,433 --> 01:26:19,866
Thank you.

922
01:28:02,753 --> 01:28:04,311
I, uh.

923
01:28:14,513 --> 01:28:18,188
Today at noon, I have done something,

924
01:28:20,953 --> 01:28:23,467
against our agreement.

925
01:28:26,513 --> 01:28:30,825
This afternoon I went outside with Alex,

926
01:28:31,513 --> 01:28:36,985
and things didn't go as I wanted.

927
01:28:39,673 --> 01:28:41,629
No big deal.

928
01:28:46,593 --> 01:28:48,584
I love you so much!

929
01:28:49,553 --> 01:28:51,384
I don't mind.

930
01:28:56,433 --> 01:29:01,143
Hey.

931
01:29:43,633 --> 01:29:44,952
Diana?

932
01:29:46,393 --> 01:29:47,872
Hello, Mam.

933
01:29:49,833 --> 01:29:52,631
Yes, fine, we are about to go.

934
01:29:55,353 --> 01:30:01,064
That was Alex. A friend
and Timo, her husband.

935
01:30:17,833 --> 01:30:19,232
Done, yes?

936
01:30:22,353 --> 01:30:24,071
I don't care, Mum.

937
01:30:31,393 --> 01:30:32,382
So...

938
01:30:46,033 --> 01:30:47,352
Did they have a nice weekend?

939
01:30:47,673 --> 01:30:49,664
They can't all have these problems.

940
01:30:51,513 --> 01:30:52,262
Impossible!
