{1172}{1303}You may be king|You may possess the world
{1305}{1366}And its gold
{1368}{1446}But gold won't bring you|happiness
{1448}{1550}When you're growin' old
{1552}{1608}The world still is the same
{1609}{1676}You never change it
{1726}{1805}As sure as the stars
{1807}{1890}Shine above
{1892}{2077}You're nobody|'til somebody loves you
{2079}{2204}So find yourself|somebody to love

{3599}{3694}So find yourself|somebody to love
{3810}{3897}- Okay, so what if l don't|want to give up on her?|- You don't call.
{3899}{3970}- You said l don't call if|l wanted to give up on her.|- Right.
{3972}{4046}- So l don't call either way.|- Right.
{4047}{4134}- So what's the difference?|- There is no difference right now.
{4136}{4210}See, Mike, the only difference|between giving up and not giving up...
{4211}{4274}is if you take her back|when she wants to come back.
{4276}{4338}But you can't do anything|to make her want to come back.
{4340}{4414}ln fact, you can only do stuff|to make her not want to come back.
{4415}{4507}So the only difference is|if l forget about her or just|pretend to forget about her.
{4509}{4578}- Right.|- Well, that sucks.
{4579}{4643}Yeah, it sucks.
{4645}{4748}So it's like a retroactive|decision then? l mean, l|could, like, forget about her.
{4750}{4830}And then when she comes back, make like|l just pretended to forget about her?
{4863}{4941}Right, although probably|more likely the opposite.
{4943}{4989}What do you mean?
{4991}{5061}l mean, at first you're gonna pretend|to forget about her.
{5063}{5121}Not call her,|l don't know, whatever.
{5123}{5177}But then, eventually,|you really will forget about her.
{5179}{5260}- Well, unless she comes back first.|- Mm, see, that's the thing.
{5262}{5331}Somehow they know not to come back|until you really forget.
{5423}{5483}- There's the rub.|- There's the rub.
{5557}{5685}Look, man, uh, l-l'm sorry we always|talk about the same thing all the time.
{5687}{5767}- Ah, no, it's all right.|- lt's just that, you know...|lt's just you been there, man.
{5768}{5823}- Don't sweat it.|- Your advice really helps.|And l just, l don't know...
{5825}{5915}You know, Rob, you're the only one|l can talk to about her.

{24858}{24916}l don't know if they're talking|about how hard it is to be adopted...

{26048}{26095}They don't go|for the sensitive shit.
{26097}{26179}You start talking to 'em about, uh,|you know, puppy dogs and ice cream.
{26180}{26263}They know what you want to do.|What do you think?|You really think they don't know?
{26264}{26330}- No. l know.|- They know what you want,|baby. Believe me.

{26474}{26567}lt's just that l get this thing|where l want to be a gentleman|and l wanna show respect.
{26569}{26630}Oh, Mike.|Respect, my ass.
{26631}{26680}What they respect is honesty.
{26682}{26775}Look, you see how they dress|when they go out, right?|They want you to notice 'em.
{26776}{26853}All you're doin' is letting|them know that it's working.|Get off this respect kick.
{26855}{26926}There's nothing wrong with letting|the girls know that you're money...
{26927}{27009}- and that you wanna party.|- You ready to order?
{27011}{27083}Yeah. l'll have a coffee...|Two, uh, two coffees.

{30031}{30115}Um, do you ever play out here?|l'd love to see you sometime.
{30117}{30163}- No.|- Why not?
{30165}{30249}Well, there are, uh... You know,|it's just different circuits.
{30251}{30321}- lt's hard to explain.|You wouldn't understand.|- Who's your booking agent?

{30698}{30769}- l'm a producer.|- Oh! Cool!
{30771}{30817}[Whispers]|That's great.
{30819}{30873}[Christy] l'm really|not supposed to drink here.
{30875}{30984}We should go someplace else.|How's my place?
{30986}{31039}- Yeah, that's great.|- Yeah?
{31041}{31111}- All right?|- Yeah, we... Yeah, sure.
{31113}{31179}- Right.|- Because if you can't drink here...
{31181}{31227}- Then you can't drink.|- Why not?
{31229}{31299}- That'll be great.|- Okay, great. Let's go.
{31303}{31374}[Christy]|You were in Acapulco Beach?
{31376}{31436}[Lisa]|We watch that all the time.
{31438}{31514}- No, no, no, no, wait.|- [Trent] Yeah, yeah.
{31515}{31606}The worst was when l went in for|this Afterschool Special, right?
{31607}{31661}So l'm sitting|in the waiting room,
{31663}{31737}and there's all these little kids, uh,|sitting in the waiting room with me.
{31739}{31808}And l see that all the kids are signed|in for the exact same role as me.
{31810}{31879}- They're auditioning for|the same role as you?|- Right.
{31881}{31982}So, uh, l check the time and the place.|l'm where l'm supposed to be.
{31983}{32075}l call my agent up. She says, "Trent,|they asked for you specifically."
{32077}{32142}- What was the thing?|- l don't know what it was.|lt was "Drugs are Bad."
{32144}{32210}"Jenny Eats Something." Whatever.|lt's Afterschool Special bullshit.
{32211}{32258}- Right. [Giggles]|- "Jenny Eats Something."
{32259}{32350}The role l'm reading for is "brother."|l'm reading for the part of "brother."
{32351}{32412}Big brother|or little brother?
{32414}{32490}- Just brother, man. Just brother.|- No.
{32491}{32558}Just brother, right? Finally l get|to go in and meet everyone, right?
{32559}{32612}Mikey, l'm telling you,|l was money.
{32614}{32666}lt's a starring role.|l practiced for a week.
{32668}{32758}So l'm reading with the casting director|and, girls, l literally start crying.
{32759}{32806}- No.|- l swear to God.
{32807}{32862}The casting director who's reading with|me kinda gets caught up in the vibe.
{32863}{32910}- She starts crying.|- Oh!
{32911}{32978}- Yeah, l swear to God. Swear to God.|- Wow.
{32979}{33052}So now she's crying.|l'm crying.
{33054}{33146}We're both kinda crying, but not|the kind of crying that's like...
{33147}{33208}But the kind of crying that's|like we're trying not to cry.
{33210}{33288}Do you know what l mean? Like we're not|trying to... Whatever. lt was very cool.
{33290}{33355}So l finished reading with her.
{33357}{33424}l finally hold up my finger,|like give me a minute here.
{33426}{33472}- Right.|- [Choking Up] Like give me a minute.
{33474}{33556}More than that, 'cause l'm in it.|But like l'm broke.
{33558}{33656}[Sobbing] Give me a second here.|May l have a minute?
{33658}{33756}So l put down my head,|and the whole room sits in silence...
{33758}{33804}for at least five minutes.
{33806}{33852}- Swear to God, five minutes.|- Whoa!
{33854}{33909}l look up, everyone|rips up in applause.
{33911}{34000}The whole room is rip-roaring clapping|it up for me, for big T, right?
{34002}{34113}Everyone in the room is sitting|there tearing their face.|They're crying their eyes out.
{34115}{34192}The guy working the camera, you know,|just filming it? Got tears in his eyes.
{34194}{34264}- Not the camera guy.|- l swear to God, the camera guy.
{34266}{34340}Not so much from my reading,|although it had a lot to do with it,
{34342}{34393}but, really, he had|his own things going on.
{34395}{34454}So the producer|starts to talk to me.
{34455}{34522}He says, "Trent, when you|walked in this room,
{34524}{34590}l didn't see Trent Walker|come in here."
{34592}{34670}He said, "l saw big brother|come in here." Fuckin' great, right?
{34671}{34734}He says, "You walked in with the role,|you nailed it, you're great."
{34735}{34803}- So give me the fuckin' part.|- Exactly. Right?
{34805}{34923}Then he says to me... He says,|"Trent, l gotta be honest with you.
{34924}{35022}l think that it might be that|you may be just a little bit old...
{35024}{35084}for the role of brother."
{35086}{35146}So l felt confident,|'cause l gave a good read.
{35148}{35219}l say to him, "Well, how old exactly|is the role of brother?"
{35220}{35267}- [Mike] Here it comes.|- 'Cause l'm tall.
{35268}{35327}- Here it comes.|- But l look young, Mike.|Do l look young, girls?
{35328}{35377}Yeah, you do.
{35379}{35450}So he says to me... l swear to God he|says this to me with a straight face.
{35452}{35551}This fucking guy.|"Eleven years old."
{35555}{35601}- And you said "double down."|- Double down.
{35601}{35658}Because you know why? Because you|make it happen on the bets.
{35659}{35706}He's great, isn't he?
{35707}{35790}But the truth of the matter was,|you saw my picture, you saw my tape.
{35792}{35859}You know l'm 24 years old.|Why did you call me in?
{35861}{35926}- Wow.|- That's your great bit.
{35927}{36018}Well, we all have stories.
{36019}{36066}- Wow.|- Yup.
{36247}{36375}Uh, how rude of me. l never...|l never gave you the... the tour.
