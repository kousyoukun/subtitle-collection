1
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
What do you want?

2
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm from downstairs.

3
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,120
That's nice.
So?

4
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,680
I would like you to stop shouting.

5
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,120
We are sorry.

6
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,560
- Are you OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.

7
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,920
Did you hit her?

8
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,120
What's it to you?

9
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,960
Look, it's ok.

10
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,560
It's fine. I'll calm down.
Don't worry.

11
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,840
Go back to bed.

12
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,400
Look here, gran.
Don't you piss me off today.

13
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,160
Buzz off or I'll clock you.

14
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,720
- Leave her alone.
- Shut your fucking mouth!

15
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,800
Don't you get it?
What do I do now?

16
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,560
Let her go!

17
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,520
MY HEROES

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,680
She bit me, the cow!

19
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,880
Yes, mum?

20
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,640
Who are you?

21
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,720
Yep. But where is she?

22
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,560
What happened?

23
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,240
Let me talk to her.

24
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,400
What about the bills?

25
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,800
Stop moving and answer me.

26
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,560
Listen, I'll think about it.

27
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,160
Remember Moutier?
He called thrice.

28
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,520
I'll give it to him, if you like.

29
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,160
I'll deal with it.

30
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,120
- Did you get me a car?
- The Volkswagen.

31
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,240
Yours for the weekend.
I want answers on Monday.

32
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,360
Thanks.

33
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,360
You are the boss!

34
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,360
Still in your coat?

35
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,400
I'm going back out.

36
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,800
Where are you going?

37
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,440
To fetch grannie in Bordeaux.

38
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,840
What the heck is she doing there?

39
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,240
Eat up.

40
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,120
She has been arrested.

41
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,240
I want an ice-cream.

42
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,880
Eat your beans first.

43
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,560
Gran always gives it to me.

44
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,160
Not talking to me anymore?

45
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
To say what?

46
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,280
We've said everything,
haven't we?

47
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,320
Unless there's something else
you forgot to say.

48
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,680
So, go on. I'm listening.

49
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,680
What do we do now?

50
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,240
I don't know...

51
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,520
- Not now.
- When?

52
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,320
I don't know.
When I get back.

53
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,160
Mum, he's making a mess!

54
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,960
You can go.

55
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,520
How about giving me your bag?

56
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,440
Drive me to the station.

57
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,400
Don't be foolish.
You can come with me.

58
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,840
And hear your lectures?

59
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,880
Why give them my number then?

60
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,320
You'd prefer that I rot in jail?

61
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,600
- You could have called dad.
- Definitely not him.

62
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,880
Wait! You don't know
where the car is.

63
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,280
Mum, wait up. Wait.

64
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,560
Wait!

65
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,680
Why did you wrestle the cop?

66
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,000
How could I know he was a cop.
He was half-naked!

67
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,880
Hit your wife, be a cop!

68
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,760
Oh. But why go to an hotel?

69
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,320
I'm on a break.
A break from your dad.

70
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,840
Calm down!

71
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,040
Mum, get back here.

72
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,880
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

73
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,760
Can I get you anything?

74
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,680
- Any Pain-Aux-Raisins?
- No, just sandwiches.

75
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,120
Rillette sandwich,
glass of Cote.

76
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,880
Two.

77
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,120
Two what?

78
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,480
Sandwich and Cote, please.

79
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,160
Two Cotes, please.

80
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,200
The cops never even fed me.
Nothing!

81
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,480
In my view, you are lucky.

82
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,480
Why?

83
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,280
Because the arsehole didn't
have the balls to book me.

84
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,880
He didn't dare.

85
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,160
Hi, dad.

86
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,160
Yes, it's me.
I know, I'm with her now.

87
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,040
In Bordeaux.

88
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,120
No, no, everything's fine.

89
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,200
I'll bring her back.

90
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,000
She wants to talk to you.
Hold on.

91
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,120
Please, mum.

92
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,040
Please!

93
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,880
Excuse me.

94
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,480
She can't talk now, she's busy.

95
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,880
We'll call you when we get a chance.

96
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,400
Eh? Yes, dad.

97
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,720
See you soon.

98
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,880
Bon appetit.

99
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,000
You are really hungry?

100
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,200
Rillettes remind me of my
grandma. Our 11am bite!

101
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,480
It's not 8 yet.

102
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,840
I'd go with you, if I'm driving.

103
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,200
No way.
Out of the question.

104
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,440
You can't.
It's not allowed.

105
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,000
You can't drive an ambulance.

106
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,440
That, or it's the station.

107
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,600
Is it yes or no?

108
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,600
If, and I do mean "if",

109
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,760
I cede to your demand,

110
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,040
do you promise to make up with dad?

111
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,760
I didn't hear you.

112
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,480
I promise.

113
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,160
Keep your eyes on the road.

114
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,400
Don't be like your father.

115
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,320
- How is he?
- An old man.

116
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,600
Be warned.
He's getting worse.

117
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,480
Aren't you a bit harsh?

118
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,880
If only you knew!

119
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,600
Your discs?

120
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,880
- No.
- Good.

121
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,320
They are not for patients.

122
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,320
Although, they would only hear
the sirens.

123
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,200
Mum, stop playing with this.

124
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,320
If we're caught,
I'll have to close shop.

125
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,920
Where are we? Why didn't
you take the motorway?

126
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,760
I must meet someone.

127
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,560
I was scared you'd get lost.

128
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,280
Tiemoko's mum is a cleaner
at the local sports centre.

129
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,440
Last Friday, the police did an
identity check on the staff.

130
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,160
Apparently, her papers were invalid.

131
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,840
In any case, they kept her.

132
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
Thanks.

133
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,000
Are you hungry now?

134
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,320
She had time to tell
her colleague to ask us

135
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,320
to hide the children.

136
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,480
That way, they can't expel her.

137
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,560
Well, we hope so.

138
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,280
- My number, just in case.
- Thanks.

139
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,640
The police raided the school,
but the children

140
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,640
were with their hosts.
But it's a small area,

141
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,760
so he can't stay here for long.

142
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,760
Any brothers or sisters?

143
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
A sister.

144
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,920
Exfiltrated.
She's in Strasbourg.

145
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,840
"Exfiltrated"?

146
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,480
It's the word we use in the field.

147
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,480
"The field"...I see!

148
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,360
Anyway,
Tiemoko must leave the area.

149
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,040
I'll get the rest of his things.

150
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,440
What? Why are you staring
at me like that?

151
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,200
We are just a support group.

152
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,200
I'm not going to sit back

153
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,360
and watch my country
expel so many people?

154
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,760
Hello, Tiemoko.

155
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,440
I'm Olga.

156
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,160
Want to come with us?

157
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,640
Can I talk to you?

158
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,640
- Let go, you're hurting me.
- Please!

159
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,480
What are you doing?

160
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,000
How's that?
I'm sure you understand.

161
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,760
You are no age to adopt!

162
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,200
Adopt? I'm just hiding him
for her mother.

163
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,640
Yeah? And if they send her
back home?

164
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,080
Her "home" is here.

165
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,600
Okay. If they throw her
on a plane, what do you do?

166
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,920
What about dad in all this?

167
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,680
Aha! That's why you argued.

168
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,560
Yes, that's why too.

169
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,280
Doesn't his health count?

170
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,680
If you're here to annoy me, go!
We'll take the train.

171
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,520
Now, wait a minute.
Shit!

172
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,920
Mr Moutier...

173
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,000
That's a nice bag.

174
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,480
And you...

175
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,080
What do you mean?

176
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,880
Oh! Yes...
No, don't you worry.

177
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,800
I just had a small hiccup.

178
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,360
But I've got the money.

179
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,640
How about we go on a holiday
together?

180
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,640
I'm away right now.
It's not very...

181
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,920
I've got you my son's pyjamas.

182
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,320
Tiemoko hates them,
but they are warm.

183
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,600
Thank you.

184
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,120
It's just a hiccup...

185
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,000
- It's good of you to come.
- You'll get your envelope!

186
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,680
That's it. Right.

187
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,800
Right then...shall we go?

188
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,200
The ambulance is great.

189
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,640
We'll get through the checkpoints.

190
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,640
Take off your hood.

191
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,800
As you wish.

192
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,200
You were the hood type too.
You wear a beanie or a hoodie.

193
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,640
Yours was the hoodie.

194
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,000
Thanks for telling me.

195
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,640
Why don't we have lunch by the sea.

196
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,040
It's not on our way.

197
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,360
We are very close. We must
use the small roads anyway.

198
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,360
You can be really tiring, you know?

199
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,600
I know, but you still must use
the small roads.

200
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,760
Aren't he cold, the boy?

201
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,840
I'm lost. First you want to
dump him, suddenly you care.

202
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,360
Aha, there you go!
This I like.

203
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,680
That's her!

204
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,800
You like crabs?

205
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,200
And waffles?
You like those?

206
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,040
We might as well
take some fresh air.

207
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,360
Where's he going?

208
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,360
To La Rochelle.

209
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,960
Yes, she was in Bordeaux.
It's not simple. I'll explain soon.

210
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,920
Well, if we don't stop
every 10 minutes,

211
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,280
we should be there late afternoon.

212
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,640
What?

213
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,400
Oh no, not that, please.
We'll discuss it later.

214
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,240
No, not now.

215
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,640
I don't know.

216
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,280
Nice, isn't it?

217
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,800
Okay, okay.

218
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,360
Okay, then.
Give the children a hug. Yes. Bye.

219
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,560
Did you say hello for me?

220
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,560
- Yes or no?
- Yes, mum.

221
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,040
How are my princes?

222
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,800
- Very well.
- Good.

223
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,680
I'm not sticking my nose in,

224
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,280
but...
- I'd be shocked. Not you!

225
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,240
Marry her.

226
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,960
It's been a long time.

227
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
May I go and play?

228
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,920
Of course, but stay close.

229
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,680
I'd be on my third wife
listening to you.

230
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,480
I mean it now. In my garden,
my princes as page boys.

231
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,800
Must I get married to have
a party in your garden?

232
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,080
I'm sure she'll be overjoyed.

233
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,400
She needs reassurance.

234
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,520
We have 2 children together.

235
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,360
This looks like a commitment
to me, not so?

236
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,840
You don't get it.
You're not a woman.

237
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,680
Meanwhile, you should change jobs.

238
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,920
No good in being a boss,
if you are always away.

239
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,200
I get a salary,
which keeps me alive.

240
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,000
But you're never home.

241
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,800
In my view,

242
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,680
you'd be a good lawyer.

243
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,640
You do know you must study?

244
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,360
Come on, now.
I'm not completely gaga.

245
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,560
But if I needed a lawyer,
I'd choose you.

246
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,280
If dad's health worsens,
what will you do with the boy?

247
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,400
You'll take him.

248
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,240
Oh, of course!

249
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,520
Shouldn't I be asking Stephanie?

250
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,680
If she refuses, divorce her.

251
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,280
Jacques!

252
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,560
Jacques!

253
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,680
Quiet.
You'll wake up the boy.

254
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,560
- Where is he now?
- Having a nap.

255
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,120
Jacques!

256
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,920
Jacques!

257
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,080
Jacques!

258
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,560
Don't worry.

259
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,280
Jacques!

260
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,960
He's not here!

261
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,120
We didn't warn him.
He may have gone out.

262
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,400
Something's wrong.

263
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,960
Mum...

264
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,080
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have left him alone.

265
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,080
They are probably thinking
I'm dying.

266
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,240
Then her shouting all the time...

267
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,280
What a nice idea!

268
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,280
- But it's not for now.
- Hi, dad.

269
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,280
Hi, son.

270
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,280
- Where were you?
- With a hooker.

271
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,680
Okay. I was picking mushrooms
with Jean.

272
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,280
I could hear your shouts.

273
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,840
- Why didn't you answer?
- I wasn't here! Really you!...

274
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,880
She goes days without a word

275
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,520
and when she returns,
she yells at me.

276
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,400
I told you where I was going.

277
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,120
This is Tiemoko.

278
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,240
Hiya.

279
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,720
Hello, sir.

280
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,240
That's Jacques, my husband.
What did you eat?

281
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,560
I've invited Jean for snacks.

282
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,240
The doctor said, "5 fruits
and vegetables a day."

283
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,120
And what's this?

284
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,120
Call him "pépé",
that will teach him.

285
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,000
Let go of my hand.

286
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,960
Why are you grinning?

287
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,440
I didn't say anything.

288
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,080
Take off your shoes
and wear slippers.

289
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,720
We have all the sizes,
many toys too.

290
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,120
Come see the toys.

291
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,640
We've got good music too.

292
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,840
Tell me about him...

293
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,040
When you've finished,
bring the castle and soldiers?

294
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,520
They are in the trunk
under the stairs.

295
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,560
All right.

296
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,240
I made those pompoms.
You like them?

297
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,880
What do you want to eat?

298
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,320
Is there something you like?

299
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,720
Don't you want
to remove your hood?

300
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,440
It doesn't work.

301
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,280
Must be the batteries.
Pépé will change them.

302
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,720
Jacques!

303
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,440
- Where's your father?
- Don't know.

304
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,000
Nice slippers!

305
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,840
Jacques!

306
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,520
Don't worry.

307
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,560
What are you doing?

308
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,720
Having a shave.

309
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,720
And your hat?

310
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,240
How many times must I tell you.
You want to annoy me?

311
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,160
I can't hear. Come down,
if you want to talk.

312
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,400
The little boy want batteries!

313
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,400
Anybody there?

314
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,280
It's Jean.

315
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,960
But you do hear your pal!

316
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
I'm sure he smokes on the quiet.

317
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,400
Honestly, how do you find him?

318
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,000
He seems well.

319
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,320
The doctors did warn me
about possible side effects.

320
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,560
Losing his keys, making lamps.

321
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,960
He puts a shade on everything.

322
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,840
Too big?

323
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,240
You'll see. Now,
he keeps smiling to himself.

324
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,840
- He's just happy to be home.
- He is surely happy!

325
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,000
Before, he just couldn't
stay still. Now, he just

326
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,040
goes out to pick mushrooms.

327
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,120
You blame him for being calmer?

328
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,960
He's into Nicole Croisille.

329
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,000
Ooh! I see!

330
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,840
Well, you always take his side.

331
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,840
It's good when you need a nap.

332
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,440
Simple. Just 5 minutes
and I'm asleep.

333
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,120
And when I wake up,
the pain is gone.

334
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,280
The last time, even my bum
was prickling like mad.

335
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,760
Everywhere.
A real hedgehog!

336
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,760
The worse bit...

337
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,400
was my toes. Soon as you feel
the prickling coming,

338
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,160
you want to move your toes.

339
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,960
Anyway, it works.

340
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,160
I must be on my 5th session
and I feel younger.

341
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,400
Last month, remember?
I couldn't get out of bed.

342
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,160
- My rheumatism is gone.
- Bring your pal.

343
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,920
- I don't have rheumatism.
- You keep farting.

344
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,920
Very nice!

345
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,000
At the table too!
What manners!

346
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,480
Jean, does he fart or not?

347
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,680
Eh?

348
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,440
With mushrooms, it's fine.

349
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,040
No. But we are famous
at the butcher.

350
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,120
Enough of my flatulence tonight.

351
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,560
Your mother...

352
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,120
Look and follow!

353
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,560
You always bump us
out of your kitchen.

354
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,160
And where are you now?

355
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,160
Put it here.

356
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,400
Super. Thank you, Tiemoko.

357
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,440
How's your son?

358
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,000
Runs the shop strictly,
no fun to his wife,

359
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,160
church every Sunday, a real dickhead!

360
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,280
No church for you?

361
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,000
Can't with my rheumatism.

362
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,280
- And you, job okay?
- I'm thinking...

363
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,280
...maybe of changing.

364
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,280
Maybe I'll be a lawyer.

365
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,560
It's a joke.

366
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,720
Bugger! I believed you.

367
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,120
If you know one, I can use him.
Still no fuel.

368
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,120
I knew it.

369
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,440
The girl there,
I gave her an earful!

370
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,920
Why yell at a girl on minimum pay?

371
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,280
- It's not her fault.
- What do I do?

372
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,000
Hello? Yes, I'm here.

373
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,000
Right. It's bedtime for us.

374
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,640
And I forbid you to piss on my lawn.

375
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,880
How about some Calva?

376
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,120
Better! A bottle of plum!

377
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,160
I might not be back
tomorrow morning.

378
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,280
I'll spend the day here.

379
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,440
I see.

380
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,360
What about the children?

381
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,440
Are we there already?

382
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,280
They'd be better with you, anyway.

383
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,280
It's not right.

384
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,280
Why throw it all away?

385
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,200
I'm not the one
who threw it all away.

386
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,360
I told you I was stupid.
What more do you want?

387
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,000
I'd like to turn back the time.
But I can't.

388
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,880
We have to ask ourselves
why it happened.

389
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,440
What's happening?

390
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,000
I'm off.
Still here tomorrow?

391
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,880
I'm on the phone.

392
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,720
Come pick mushrooms with us.

393
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,440
They are great this year!

394
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,280
Go on home, you're mumbling.
I'll walk with you.

395
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,000
Are you listening?

396
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,080
Yes. I...

397
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,440
I'll call you later.

398
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,560
- Maxime...
- Yes.

399
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,920
I want us to work.

400
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,440
Good night.

401
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,280
Mummy!

402
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,640
Coming.

403
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,160
What are you doing?

404
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,440
Shutting up.

405
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,000
Why did you hang up?

406
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,440
Really mum?

407
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,160
Prying as ever, I see!

408
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,160
Eh? Prying as ever!

409
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,280
Did I ask your opinion?
No!

410
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,000
All day bearing you and I ask
for 2 minutes, just 2 minutes!

411
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,880
But it's too much for you!

412
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,280
You are tiresome, mum.
You hear?

413
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,440
Tiresome!

414
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,880
Cold?

415
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,280
Do I get a kiss?

416
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,800
Can I kiss you, then?

417
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,000
Please?

418
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
Thank you.

419
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,720
Let's play 'I like', ok?

420
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,360
You say aloud things you like.

421
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,360
You'll see, it's easy and fun.
Want to try?

422
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,000
I'll go first.

423
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,160
Chocolate éclair...

424
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,880
Tarte Tatin with fresh cream...

425
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,720
Salted-butter

426
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,440
macaron...

427
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,720
Millefeuille...

428
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,160
Only cakes?

429
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,720
No. Anything you like.
But I like cakes.

430
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,520
You don't say "Jacques"?

431
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,160
Yes, I say "Jacques".

432
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,880
And I say "mummy".

433
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,280
I say "Christmas".
I like Christmas a lot.

434
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,440
Can you read a story?

435
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,000
Yes.

436
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,720
So...

437
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,440
"It was Christmas night."

438
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,600
Were you the one shouting?

439
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,720
What happened?

440
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,160
Nothing.

441
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,600
Stop sulking,
you look just like her.

442
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,440
It's time I bring out the glasses.

443
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,440
- Here.
- Thanks.

444
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,720
You've moved the trunk?

445
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,240
Moving furniture,
old people do that.

446
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,440
With your mum, I'm safe.

447
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,600
You've got even more lamps here.

448
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,720
Her fault. She hates to sell any.
They pile up.

449
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,720
We pile everything, in fact.

450
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,600
Even children.

451
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,720
Well, he's cute.

452
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,800
He could bite!

453
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,000
I prefer to see her
bringing work home.

454
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,720
Else she's always out.

455
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,440
Homeless people,
transfusion, strikes...

456
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,240
She's never here!

457
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,600
With the boy, she has to stay home.

458
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,000
She never looks after you.

459
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,720
Who's complaining?

460
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,880
But she does behave like a trucker.

461
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,720
Still, how's the health?

462
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,720
Good.

463
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,240
Your mother thinks
I'm a bit gaga, but I'm fine.

464
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,280
She's not used to see you around,
she'll come round.

465
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,280
I do annoy her!

466
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,880
But it's not only that.
She's worried.

467
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,440
She's worried
that I go belly up on her.

468
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,680
It was just a stroke.

469
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,880
Like a warning.

470
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,400
It may never recur.

471
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,000
For someone healthy,
I've got a lot of pills to swallow.

472
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,920
You must start readying
for my departure.

473
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,560
But it won't be soon.

474
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,560
That's my problem.
I do things too soon.

475
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,320
Look at you.

476
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,880
Eh? You're blaming me again.

477
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,280
Yes!

478
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,720
I've always felt
I had you too young,

479
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,280
when I wasn't ready.

480
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,200
On the other hand,
had we waited for a child,

481
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,000
it wouldn't have been you.

482
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,400
You wouldn't exist.

483
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,880
So you see...

484
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,440
I don't regret it.

485
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,920
The first time I heard this,
I met your mother.

486
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,160
The next year, you were born.

487
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,440
Are you removing your hat,
or do you sleep with it?

488
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,320
Your mother fears draughts
and I'm now frail.

489
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,440
You should try a hoodie.

490
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,000
- Anyway, I'm going back out.
- Where to?

491
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,280
I had to be at death's door
to love these moments.

492
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,600
What a fool!

493
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,880
Got a cigarette?

494
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,640
What?

495
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm not going to burst an
artery by taking a puff.

496
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,320
I stopped smoking 2 years ago.
As if you forgot.

497
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,080
These are the times
I miss your wife.

498
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,640
What do you mean?
When you piss outside?

499
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,160
No. When I need some empathy.

500
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,440
She'll let me light her cigarette.

501
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,440
It wouldn't be a good deed.

502
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,600
She's a remarkable woman.

503
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,080
Didn't you think she was a pest?

504
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,320
I never said it was a flaw.

505
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,880
Jacques!

506
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,080
The main thing is not to get bored.

507
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,080
I didn't hear you reply.

508
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,640
What were you doing?

509
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,720
Just us men talking.

510
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,440
With your fly undone?

511
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,360
Where are my Xmas decorations?

512
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,160
"Christmas decorations"?

513
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,000
Yes. The balls, tinsel...

514
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,720
I know, I'm tiresome.

515
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,880
It's not that.
We're in September.

516
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,160
What if I want it to be Christmas?

517
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,280
Your hat!

518
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,280
Okay.

519
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,800
That's fine, get back in!

520
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,600
Quickly, you'll catch a cold!

521
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,040
Okay.

522
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,600
Morning, honeybunch.

523
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,040
What are the lights for?

524
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,880
So Father Christmas comes.

525
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,160
It's not Christmas.

526
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,880
But this is a special place.
He comes often.

527
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,160
Come and sit down.

528
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,880
What do you want, chocolate?

529
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,040
Morning.

530
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,160
Hiya.

531
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,600
My bread!

532
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,240
Why give him my bread?
Get him another one.

533
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,160
How old are you?
You've got your kiwi.

534
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,720
In my view, he'll come for lunch.

535
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,040
Who?

536
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,320
Father Christmas.

537
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,600
With a bit of luck, we'll see him.

538
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,040
Eh, pépé?

539
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,160
Why do pépé wear a robe?

540
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,040
Because he's an old git.

541
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,880
Remove your head cover,
then you can talk.

542
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,440
- I want to pee.
- Don't see the link.

543
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,600
- Want me to go with you?
- No, I'll go on my own.

544
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,000
- What?
- Took your blood pressure?

545
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:22,920
Morning.

546
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,400
Finally! Hi, son.

547
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,840
He goes out butt naked,
so he gets sick.

548
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,120
- You told me to go.
- With your hat.

549
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,400
- Great mood!
- Hang on to your bread.

550
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,560
Let me tell you that I won't
be your Father Christmas.

551
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,200
- Nobody asked you.
- I know you.

552
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,120
I'm off shopping after this.

553
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,120
I'm buying Christmas presents,
so I can't take the boy.

554
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,280
I can watch him.

555
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,000
Oh no, not you.
I don't want to tire you out.

556
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,400
Please, mum. I'm sorry for
getting cross yesterday.

557
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,200
Forgive me. Will this do?

558
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,480
In any case, I need you.
Your father can watch the boy.

559
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,200
Can't, got my mushrooms.

560
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,200
Take him along.

561
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,560
- Mushroom picking?
- Yes!

562
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,120
For his present,
why not wrap any old toy?

563
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,120
You say this
because he's black?

564
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,360
Dammit! I spent the night
hanging up your balls and all,

565
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,840
what more do you want from me?
Buy him reindeers?

566
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,120
Sorry to bother you.

567
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,280
Sorry, but the bell didn't work.

568
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,560
Oh yes, I must repair it...

569
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,280
Please, do sit down.
Some coffee?

570
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,440
No, thanks.

571
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,280
Weren't you going to have a poo?

572
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,400
Then hurry up.

573
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,840
Forgive him. Old age.

574
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,400
Her husband said
she's in a support group...

575
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,080
- And you have the boy.
- You believe him?

576
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,560
The neighbour saw him go in an
ambulance. He took the number.

577
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,840
That of your vehicle
parked in the garden.

578
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,280
The child must be repatriated
with his mother.

579
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,360
Yes, we did take the boy.

580
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,000
We dropped him off
with friends in Paris.

581
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,440
And the address?

582
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,280
I still have some Jews too,
interested?

583
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,280
- Don't take it this way.
- How must I take it?

584
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,000
Like this?

585
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,280
Don't worry.

586
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,840
Everything's fine.

587
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,640
I'm here, don't be scared.

588
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,000
Don't worry.

589
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,280
Aiming at me?

590
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,440
If I were, boy, you'd have had
it in the face.

591
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,840
- Don't talk to me like that.
- Get lost! This is my home.

592
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,840
Look ma'am,
answer us or we'll arrest you.

593
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,720
Follow us.

594
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,560
- Try and I'll ram your balls!
- Enough!

595
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,800
I said, "Enough!"

596
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,280
We'll go make your statement,
if you want.

597
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,160
Now leave her alone.

598
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,000
I said don't touch her!

599
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,640
What's wrong with you?

600
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,440
Beating an old lady
for helping a child!

601
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,880
Is that what your job is?

602
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,440
If that is what police do,
you should change jobs.

603
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,440
Next time, you won't even ring,

604
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,160
you'll bash the door in.

605
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,520
No longer public servants.

606
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,880
How could you look at your
kids, what would you say?

607
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,800
You were mistaken, you were wrong?

608
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,840
You never helped anyone?

609
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,000
You should have done another job?
Yes, but what?

610
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,000
Lawyer?

611
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,880
It wouldn't have changed much.

612
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,280
Are you happy?

613
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,160
I'm having it bad.

614
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,160
I do deals with hospices

615
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,280
to send old people to do physio.

616
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,080
I'm not sure they need it,
but it rakes in cash.

617
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,000
I work day and night,
become a dick, and get cheated on.

618
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,080
If you want to arrest someone,
arrest me.

619
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,560
Her, she'll beat the crap out of you.

620
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,600
I don't hear anything.

621
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,720
I think they're gone.

622
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,720
It's in the genes.
They are both nuts.

623
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,680
Good. Mushrooms await,
we must go get change.

624
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,440
Coming!

625
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,880
I've got it.

626
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,880
Drink your orange juice.

627
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,240
Are you poor?

628
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,440
Why do you say that?

629
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,760
You haven't got enough
to buy a real car?

630
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,040
Hey, no phone calls in a car!

631
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,600
You forget that it's not
"a real car".

632
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,240
Yeah, it's me.

633
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,160
I'm on my way, but I'm not alone.

634
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,160
No. The boy.

635
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,520
You're not taking him with us?

636
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,520
Oh no, we can't cancel.
I've got the picnic.

637
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,720
All right.
See you by the shop.

638
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:29,320
If your son finds out where
you are, he won't be happy.

639
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,000
But you won't tell him.

640
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,880
You must rest,
says your doctor, I hear.

641
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,400
Isabelle, the more I see you,

642
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,120
the more I think
I made a big mistake.

643
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,720
Why did I ever
give the shop to my son

644
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,320
and not swap for his wife.

645
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,760
A girl so pretty,
mustn't hide among the nails,

646
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:49,840
pliers.

647
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,440
You go out and enjoy yourself.

648
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,760
My son must take you
to the sea or in the woods.

649
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,840
It's belling season.
So nice, a belling deer!

650
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,160
Stop your silliness.
Go before he gets here.

651
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,760
I'd love to go fishing.

652
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,440
Off we go!

653
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,120
You have it?

654
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,880
Good morning, Mrs Bernard.

655
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,480
- No Yule log.
- Now, that's a surprise.

656
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,480
Who cares, I'll do it myself.

657
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,960
You don't like Yule logs...

658
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,600
Quite right, too,
it's horrible.

659
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,000
I'll do a Pithivier
or a Tarte Tatin with cream.

660
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,720
Right now, I don't really care.

661
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,960
I'm proud of you.
Ata boy!

662
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,760
For not liking logs?

663
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,400
You must fight.
Don't give up.

664
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,280
Tell your children that.

665
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,600
Fight when they don't agree.
The rest is nothing.

666
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,560
Do you think we were clever?

667
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,440
Did we pretend we knew much?

668
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,880
No. We did what we could,
like you.

669
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,880
Now, we need a costume
for your father.

670
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,480
Give me the bags.

671
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,000
Wait!

672
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:04,040
I'm sorry. We get
Father Christmas end of November.

673
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,920
Now, we are just about
preparing Halloween.

674
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,920
It's not the same.

675
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:13,680
No. I've still got a clown,
Ironman and a Noddy.

676
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,200
Just like the cakes, I must
do it myself. Any fake beards?

677
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,920
Yes. I think so.

678
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,840
I'm off, I've got something to do.

679
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,400
- Where are off to?
- Mum!

680
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,120
All right, I understand.

681
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,840
In an hour, by the church, okay?

682
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,760
I should have brought my
knitting! Still, if I'm bored,

683
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,040
I'll jog round the church.

684
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,640
Need anything?

685
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,600
Buy me some stamps.
They are always useful.

686
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,120
Bring me a lotto ticket, too.

687
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,040
You play lotto, now?

688
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,320
I've got my little secrets
as well.

689
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,560
Hi, Maxime.
How's your mother?

690
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,160
- Good.
- Say hello for me.

691
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,480
Will do.

692
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,880
I'm sorry.

693
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,920
I was getting worried.

694
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,920
Well, I just escaped jail.

695
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,760
Sitting down?

696
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,480
Yes.

697
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,360
- Want to drink something?
- Coffee.

698
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,640
One coffee, please.
Thank you.

699
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,200
- The children?
- At my sister's until 3pm.

700
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,200
Good. You're okay?

701
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,720
Yes, I'm okay.

702
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,920
I think I'm going to stay here
a few days.

703
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,480
Hiding at your mum's?

704
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,200
I'm glad you called.

705
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,600
I don't think I can forgive you.

706
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,920
I'm not asking you to forgive me,

707
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,360
just for you to wake up.

708
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,640
I'm been living with a ghost
for months.

709
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,840
You closed up.
I can't get through.

710
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,360
- There you are.
- Thanks.

711
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,640
You must talk to me.

712
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,080
We can't get over it
if we don't talk.

713
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,200
I can't anymore.

714
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:10,000
I pay people to gain business.
It's been 6 months now.

715
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:14,320
You see, you start making
some compromise

716
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,760
to stay competitive,
then one day, you realise

717
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,920
that you are just losing it.

718
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,760
Why didn't you tell me before?

719
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,440
You've made mistakes
but you shouldn't let go.

720
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,200
I feel like I'm in the wrong era.

721
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,920
You're not looking
in the right place...

722
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,280
I'm your era.

723
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,560
Where are you?

724
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,080
Basket! Basket!

725
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,320
Basket.

726
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,040
- It's best in an omelette.
- With chips?

727
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,080
Yes. Not the McDo types,
but big, soft, white

728
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,080
and not overcooked.
- Yuck!

729
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,040
"Yuck"! There's no "yuck".

730
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,280
That said, even better than chips,

731
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,640
is Olga's potatoes.

732
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,160
Oh yes!

733
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,480
We'll ask her to make some.

734
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,080
Look.

735
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,360
It's why you must bring Jean

736
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,280
when going mushroom hunting.

737
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,440
No flair, but mosquitoes love him.

738
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,280
You see mosquitoes, you see girolles.

739
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,080
Are there wolves here?

740
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,920
Not that I know of.

741
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:47,480
There are only old fossils
like us here. That's no feast!

742
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,920
But now with fresh meat,
things can change!

743
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:54,000
That's a bit tender.
Too tender!

744
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,520
Are you okay, Pépé?

745
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,000
I didn't eat my kiwi this morning.

746
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,640
Let one thing be clear,

747
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,520
the next time you call me
"pépé", I will disinherit you.

748
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,920
Now, if you want a funny story,

749
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,320
I'll tell you when uncle Jean
jumped in the nettles

750
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,480
to escape a wild boar.

751
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,360
- What are you laughing about?
- You.

752
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,920
Here.

753
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,760
The best thing in mushroom hunting,

754
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,360
is the picnic.

755
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,720
I say this, but never underestimate

756
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,360
your picnic spot.
Where you choose

757
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,720
your picnic spot,
is what makes a pro.

758
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,880
Not false that.

759
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,480
Some softies
don't remove the brambles.

760
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,920
Some tiny ants scare them away.

761
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,080
Don't stay on the path.

762
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,160
You'll never see the right spot.

763
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,200
But us, we do know a good spot.

764
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,920
Nature is so beautiful.

765
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,080
Go on, grandma, move those legs!

766
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:58,960
Oh no!

767
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,080
Bugger.

768
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,040
Problems?

769
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,640
No.

770
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,520
You don't think
you'll get away with it?

771
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,520
Still public servants.

772
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,080
We'll drive you.

773
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,360
Open the door.

774
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,480
- Want to drive?
- Yes!

775
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,800
You got the stamps at least?

776
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,200
What?

777
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,680
Nothing.

778
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,400
See? I'm not asking
you any questions.

779
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,680
I'm just wondering for how long.

780
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,960
Ah! Father Christmas.

781
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,000
- Ridiculous!
- Just try it.

782
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,400
I've got my own beard.

783
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,520
But they won't know you
this way.

784
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:18,520
- Why don't you be the bozo?
- I don't have the looks.

785
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,960
What's this? Where did they
get it? Just look at me!

786
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,080
Stop moaning!

787
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,440
We mustn't lie to him.
There's no Father Christmas.

788
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,560
- He should know it now.
- Shush!

789
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,240
What did you buy him?

790
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,800
I bet you've spoilt him stupid.

791
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,440
Why buy him toys?
He's got no home!

792
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,360
What he needs is a suitcase.

793
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:42,680
Or a new hoodie.

794
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,440
Here. Try this.

795
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:53,640
Oh yes...

796
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:57,240
It's clear now
that you haven't been well.

797
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,920
Did you eat blackberries?

798
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,680
How do you know?

799
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,400
I guessed.

800
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,720
We must remove this. Can I?

801
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,360
Other than that,
what else did you do?

802
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,680
- I drove the car.
- Oh really!

803
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,080
Uncle Jacques said
I'm a good driver.

804
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:30,440
It's true that it is tough
to be worse than him.

805
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,840
Eh? "Uncle Jacques"!

806
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,240
Out you come.

807
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,520
- Ready?
- Yes.

808
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,120
And heave!

809
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,840
And what did you do else?

810
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:51,360
- I enjoyed picking mushrooms.
- Good.

811
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,960
- And the naked lady.
- "The naked lady"?

812
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,440
I see.

813
01:03:58,600 --> 01:03:59,880
Is she coming or not?

814
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,560
Your man's calling you.

815
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,880
If you don't come, I'm going.

816
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,120
Dry him.

817
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:07,240
Coming!

818
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,720
I should be fishing with Jean!

819
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:15,560
Jacques!

820
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:19,560
Do you know the 'I like' game?

821
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,720
Father Christmas, fine.
But not this.

822
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,280
If you're having a laugh, tell me.

823
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,640
Honestly, it's not too bad.

824
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,800
I'm happy you're happy.

825
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,960
Go on, snigger all you like!

826
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:46,400
Be a good man, dance with me.

827
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,600
I want him to see you
from the kitchen.

828
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,400
When I tap the pane, you disappear.

829
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,280
I disappear?

830
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,400
- How's that, I disappear?
- You run, scram.

831
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,720
- What if he follows me?
- I'll take photos.

832
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,000
I'll be in my studio.

833
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,880
Filling my sack.

834
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,000
Yes?

835
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,080
I'm sorry. I rang the bell
but it doesn't work.

836
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,520
I must repair it.

837
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,120
Is Tiemoko here?

838
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,960
Do you think Father Christmas
is here?

839
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,720
Maybe we'll surprise him
by the tree.

840
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,240
We must call uncle Jacques.

841
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,120
That's right.
Where's uncle Jacques?

842
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,280
- He'll miss it again.
- Jacques!

843
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,720
Mum!

844
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:37,520
Careful now, we're almost there.

845
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,320
Can I look?

846
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:41,840
Yes.

847
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,320
- Do I put this one here?
- Yes.

848
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,840
I'll carry them.

849
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,120
Mummy!

850
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,120
Hello.

851
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,000
I'm Sally.
Tiemoko's mother.

852
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,600
Hello.

853
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,240
Who are your friends?

854
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,120
He is Maxime.

855
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:52,960
She is his mummy.

856
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,560
And he is uncle Jacques.

857
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,280
We made a cake.
Want some?

858
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,280
Some tea?

859
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,160
Thank you.

860
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,160
You can stay here, if you want.

861
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,840
You're kind, but my girl
is in Strasbourg.

862
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,840
Do you need anything?

863
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,240
You've done so much.

864
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,160
Oh, it's nothing.

865
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,760
Tiemoko is a sweet boy.

866
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,760
He's the one
who had to bear us,

867
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:42,440
my husband and I.
It's not always easy with pépé.

868
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,680
Where will you live?

869
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,680
I have a sister in Marseille.

870
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:52,880
I can take you.

871
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:56,560
- Where? To Marseille?
- To Strasbourg.

872
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,320
To get your daughter.

873
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,720
Out of the question.
I'll go by train.

874
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,960
Tiemoko, go and play in the garden.

875
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:06,880
Can I?

876
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,160
Of course.

877
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,160
He's been very brave.

878
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,280
We weren't sure you'd be freed.

879
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:29,680
They didn't release me.

880
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,120
9 years working in France.

881
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:42,480
I clean their schools.

882
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,720
But they handcuffed me
in front of everyone,

883
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,600
took me away in a police car.

884
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,600
They locked me up like a criminal.

885
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,960
So I escaped, like a criminal.

886
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,320
I haven't even said thank you.

887
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,680
Let us help you, please.

888
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:19,480
Jacques.

889
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:20,720
What?

890
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,880
- Do something.
- What can I do?

891
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:27,600
Move your butt.
That's what you can do!

892
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,600
We can't just do nothing.

893
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:34,040
What's this country
where fear rules. Each for himself?

894
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,720
Nobody does anything.
Nothing!

895
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:39,320
Do nothing.
We can never do nothing!

896
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:42,320
I've had enough
of doing nothing. Enough!

897
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,440
I'm driving them to Paris.

898
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:14,200
I've got the train times
to Strasbourg.

899
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:18,000
If we hurry, they'll be
on the train tonight.

900
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:19,400
Thank you.

901
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:30,040
I won't let him go away alone.

902
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,920
He's not, he has his mother.

903
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,200
I'm talking about your father.

904
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,840
If he has another stroke,
I won't let him go alone.

905
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,880
- We are not there yet.
- No. But now you know.

906
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,600
This world disgusts me ever more.

907
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:53,440
Some mornings I wake up,
I just want to cry.

908
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:56,120
I'm ashamed, so ashamed.

909
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,200
I wake up to look after
your father. It's hard otherwise....

910
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,160
He needs someone
to prepare his orange juice.

911
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:16,160
I shouldn't have shouted
at him just now.

912
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,440
Mum, he's used to it.

913
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,600
That's true.

914
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:24,320
Where is he?

915
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,640
He's trying the new ball
with the boy.

916
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,360
Did he wear his hat?

917
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,440
I hope he has.

918
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,760
Or he'll get an earful!

919
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,320
Jacques!

920
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,040
Tiemoko!

921
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,280
I've found it.

922
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,320
It was amid the pumpkins.

923
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,160
- Tell us how you get on.
- I will.

924
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:58,080
Up you come!
On my shoulders.

925
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,040
Come back whenever you want.

926
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:03,720
Just come anytime,
we're always here.

927
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,720
Here's your load.

928
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:11,840
Thank you again.

929
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,360
- Tiemoko...
- Thank you.

930
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,720
Jam for my princes.
Call us once you're there.

931
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:26,440
It will be late, mum.
I'll call you tomorrow.

932
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:31,000
Don't wait too long
to visit us, you never know...

933
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,760
- Turn!
- Straight on!

934
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,000
- Watch the gate!
- You sent them in the ditch!

935
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,160
Leave him. It's his job.
He knows how to drive.

936
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,880
Still, you sent them in the ditch.

937
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:01,000
- You tire me out.
- Then eat your kiwis.

938
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,280
Did you have to offer him a lamp?

939
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,320
Not me. Father Christmas did.

940
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,040
Take care of yourself.

941
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,440
Do you see what I see?

942
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,760
I didn't see anything.

943
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,600
Is this reasonable?

944
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:41,280
"Reasonable", I don't know.
But vital, sure.

945
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,480
We'll be in Paris in 2 hours.

946
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,160
We'll catch it.

947
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:58,720
Hey, Maxime, some music?

948
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:02,880
- Do you mind?
- It's up to you.

949
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:07,040
Is it your ambulance?

950
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,080
For bypassing checkpoints.

951
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,440
Jacques!

952
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,320
No.

953
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:15,880
What were you doing?

954
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,160
- How's that?
- Before I came.

955
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:22,800
Pissing in my garden again?

956
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,880
On my own, it isn't the same.

957
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:29,760
Next time, call me,
I'll accompany you.

958
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,440
I bet you'll do it too!

959
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:36,040
Oh my! Why ever
did I marry a trucker?

960
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:43,040
Will she call us if she needs help?

961
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:45,600
- Would you do it, you?
- No.

962
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,160
But I would be wrong.

963
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,880
You are sometimes.

964
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,960
Is it too much
for you to wear shoes?

965
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:59,040
I'll go bare feet if I see
you without your hat.

966
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,680
- What's this then?
- Stop arguing!

967
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,240
Tell me rather
about the mushroom girl,

968
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,040
"uncle".
- What girl?

969
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:08,040
The naked girl.

970
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:11,160
Oh, that girl.

971
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,600
Not my type at all.

972
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,960
Really? What's your type?

973
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,440
Exceptional women.

974
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,480
Excuse me.

975
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:53,040
Here.

976
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,400
This is my number.

977
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,760
- Please call me.
- I will.

978
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,160
Promise?

979
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,480
Promise.

980
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,440
Call me when you arrive.
Goodbye.

981
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:30,760
Hey!

982
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,040
Goodbye.

983
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:35,240
See you soon.

984
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,320
"Jacques!"

985
