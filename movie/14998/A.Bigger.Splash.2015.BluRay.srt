00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,495
没有 没有找到 某人中了彩票了
No. They never found it. Somebody else won that lotto.

283
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:48,577
他后来告诉我他那晚计划把整个停车场都搜索一遍
He told me later that he had planned to kamikaze the whole lot that night

284
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,580
如果他真那么做的的话 第二天我们肯定是在厕所里
and if he had, then we would've found him

285
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:54,620
的屎尿堆里找到他
covered in shit and fizz the next day on the bathroom floor.

286
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:59,832
嗯 我想丢掉的那个包也许救了他的命...至少是暂时性的
Mm. But I think that losing that bag, it saved his life... for a while.

287
00:24:01,417 --> 00:24:04,077
天才总不羁
To be a genius is to be unruled.

288
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,620
不羁总孤独
To be unruled is to be alone.

289
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:09,462
嗯 呃 耶... 第一句可能是对的
Well, er, yeah... for the first part maybe.

290
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:13,365
- 我妹妹自杀过  - 哦 我很抱歉
- My sister has attempted suicide.  - Oh, I'm sorry.

291
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:16,962
- 两次 都是吃药自杀  - 哦
- Twice. Pills both times.  - Oh.

292
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,705
空虚导致的 知道吗
It's the height of vanity, you know?

293
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,995
你无法想象当她得知自己没死之后的尴尬
You can't imagine her embarrassment when she discovered that she lived.

294
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:26,247
是的 嗯 你知道的 所有人都不该感到羞耻
Yeah, well, you know, no one should be ashamed.

295
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:30,827
是的 是的 我告诉她当那种感觉来了之后要打电话给我
No. No. I tell her to call me if she feels it coming over her again.

296
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,500
现在 每一次电话铃响我都怨恨她多一点
Now, every time the phone rings I resent her a little more

297
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:38,747
- 我想…  - 哦
- and I think that...  - Oh!

298
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:43,667
小心你的脚
Mind your feet.

299
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:48,124
- 人不能永远活着  - 是的 没有人能永远活着
- You can't live forever.  - Exactly. None of us can.

300
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:50,292
哦 玛丽安可以
Oh, Marianne will.

301
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:53,872
呃 我们使她无聊了
Ah, we've bored her.

302
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:55,962

No, well, it was something unbelievable

307
00:25:13,584 --> 00:25:16,424
当“滚石”受到追捧 这么说吧
and that was when the Stones came into their own, so to speak.

308
00:25:16,584 --> 00:25:20,714
他们在成千上万的观众面前杀掉了自己的父亲 这么说吧
They killed their fathers, so to speak, in front of millions of people

309
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:24,415
布莱恩·琼斯（“滚石”乐队创始人之一）是最早的意外之死的例子
and the first real casualty of that was Brian Jones.

310
00:25:24,584 --> 00:25:26,374
稍等一会儿 很抱歉
Wait a second, I'm sorry.

311

She's the woman of the century and I'm talking about her soul now.

Underneath all the shit, the shellac, the noise, she's grounded.

00:25:53,292 --> 00:25:55,872
她会站在前面 张开双臂欢迎
she'll be right out in front with her arms wide open,

00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:58,962
“来吧 向我来吧 美丽的外星人”
"Come, come to me, beautiful aliens!"

Okay, I think Marianne's heard this. Sylvie, do you know this album?

379
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:21,212
我能讲一点我对滚石乐队的贡献
I can tell you a little story about my contribution to Rolling Stones history.

380
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:24,205
我在与唐·史密斯合作的时候 达瑞尔来找我
Just after Darryl came in and I was working with Don Smith,

381
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:25,825
他与我合作了很多基斯的独奏作品
who'd done a lot of Keith's solo stuff with me

382
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,670
当时我们在都柏林的温德米尔巷 外边在下雨
and we were at Windmill Lane in Dublin and it was raining.

383
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:30,464
连绵不绝的爱尔兰雨水 从来都停不下来
Non-stop Irish rain, it wouldn't fucking stop

384
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:33,205
我在戒烟 一直喝咖啡 咖啡 咖啡
and I was quitting smoking, so it was coffee, coffee, coffee

385
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:35,205
你们要听这首歌
and this song, which you are going to hear,

386
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,865
当时录得不太满意
it just wasn't fucking working.

387
00:30:37,042 --> 00:30:39,042
基斯坚持不要鼓声 知道吗
Keith is insisting no drums, you know?

388
00:30:39,209 --> 00:30:41,709
我们想法不同 我想 不 不 我对基斯说
We're working away and I think, no, no, I go to Keith and I say,

389
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:44,245
“好的 罗尼可以做一条电吉他的音轨吗
"Okay, so can Ronnie do a track on pedal steel?"

390
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:45,917
他说 ”可以 但是不要鼓“
He goes, "Yeah, but no drums."

391
00:30:46,084 --> 00:30:49,084
我当时就想 “他妈的什么想法” 我给了麦克响板
So I'm thinking "What the fuck!" So I give Mick castanets.

392
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,870
查克·里维尔弹风琴
So you've got Chuck Leavell on the harmonium

393
00:30:51,042 --> 00:30:53,422
人人都专注于音乐当中
and everyone is folding in all this beautiful shit,

394
00:30:53,584 --> 00:30:56,834
但是这首歌就是录不好 然后我跟基斯说 “你相信我吗”
but this song is not taking off, so I say to Keith, "Do you trust me?"

395
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,620
他说相信 “如果我不使用鼓 我能录一支打击乐的音轨吗”
He goes yeah. "If I promise no drums, can we do a percussion track?"

396
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,422
他说 “查理用什么乐器”
He says, "What's Charlie going to play?"

397
00:31:02,584 --> 00:31:04,174
然后我再想 “查理用什么乐器呢”
And I'm thinking, "What is Charlie going to play?"

398
00:31:04,334 --> 00:31:07,334
我在问自己 音调不那么脆的声音有什么呢
But I'm asking myself what's the sound, something, not too crisp

399
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,670
然后我四处寻找 发现了角落里的...
and I look over and I see in the corner...

400
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:13,504
- 等等 那是什么  - 是什么呢
- Wait, what is it?  - What is it?

401
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:16,617
等等 听 是什么呢 不是鼓
Wait, listen, what is it? It's not a drum.

402
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,370
- 是什么  - 听 听
- What is it? - Listen, listen!

403
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:29,462
是什么呢 她知道
What's that? She knows.

404
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,290
听
Listen!

405
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:35,789
- 是垃圾桶  - 不会吧
- It's a trash can.  - No!

406
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:39,579
是铝制的垃圾桶
It's an aluminium fucking trash can.

407
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,750
我把查理安置在楼梯井 麦克风放在三层楼之上
So I put Charlie out in the stairwell, we put a mic three floors up

408
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:44,917
然后基斯开始摇摆 因为他知道我是对的
and Keith's shaking his head 'cause he knows I'm right.

409
00:31:45,084 --> 00:31:47,964
当查理开始击打 我们都兴奋了
As soon as Charlie starts banging on it, we're off.

410
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:51,205
垃圾桶啊
A can for trash.

411
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:53,745
人类C调的演进
Human evolution in the key of C.

412
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,370
耶 这些都不能让你们兴奋起来 知道吗
Yeah, all that and you still can't fucking move to it, you know.

413
00:32:02,542 --> 00:32:05,462
好的 我们还有别的吗
Okay, what else have we got?

414
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:07,915

I'm on Kossakowski's shortlist for his documentary.

00:36:23,209 --> 00:36:25,329
很迷人
Very charming.

476
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,674
现在 答应我 今晚别说话
Now, promise me, no talking tonight.

477
00:37:09,584 --> 00:37:12,754
一些人已经在这个岛上 躲起来了
Some are on the island now, hiding.

478
00:37:12,917 --> 00:37:15,117
去年 有一艘船停靠在这里
Last year, one of the boats was spotted

479
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:19,422
走私者将企图逃跑的所有人扔到船外
and the smugglers just threw everybody overboard to try to flee,

480
00:37:19,584 --> 00:37:21,374
海岸警卫队实施了营救
whilst the coastguards did the rescues.

481
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:26,042
他们的目标是法国 很多人有家人在那边
But the goal, of course, is France. A lot of them have family there.

482
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:29,369
- 那边是 突尼斯  - 突尼斯
- There you go, Tunisia.  - Tunisia.

483
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,745
啊 在这里能闻到茉莉的香气
Ah. You can smell the jasmine from here.

484
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:37,535
哦 伙伴们 已经开始了
Oh, guys it has already started.

485
00:37:37,709 --> 00:37:39,329
矜持一点 我的宝贝
Try to behave, my angel!

486
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,080
好的
Yes!

487
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,420
我是跟我女儿说话 但你也是宝贝
I was talking to my daughter, but you can be an angel, too.

488
00:37:44,584 --> 00:37:46,964
我也是你的宝贝
I'll be your angel.

489
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,794
可以无罪的饮用了
A drink without guilt.

490
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:12,995
坦白讲 可能有点儿敏感 我在想
Now, frankly, it's sentimental to think

491
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:15,457
你能做到不在保罗面前喝酒
you can help Paul by not drinking in front of him,

492
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:18,785
不谈论那件事 得了吧 那都一年前的事了
or not talking about it for that matter. Come on, it was a year ago.

493
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:21,539
我是说 他甚至不能听到任何关于那件事的东西
I mean, if he can't even hear the subject mentioned,

494
00:38:21,709 --> 00:38:24,869
你大可不必打碎酒杯 这很荒谬
you don't have to go kicking over glasses and it's just ridiculous.

495
00:38:25,042 --> 00:38:29,462
人总是会谈论毒品 自杀 这是不可避免的
And people talk about addiction, they talk about suicide. It happens.

496
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,615
你知道吗 我怀疑他并不会自杀
You know, I doubt he wanted to kill himself anyway.

497
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:34,962
如果你问我 他想谋杀整个世界 玛丽安
If you ask me, he wanted to kill the whole world, Marianne.

498
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:36,575
是的 就是
Yeah, come on.

499
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,920
我是说 我们都了解他 这是误导
I mean, we both know him. It's misdirection.

500
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:43,544
他们是怎么描述这个的 心灵误导
That's what they call it. A case of psychic misdirection.

501
00:38:46,334 --> 00:38:48,334
不管怎样 抱歉
Anyway, sorry.

502
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:52,075
你们在一起看起来很好
You both look great together.

503
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:55,870
他把你照顾得很好 我是真心的 你看起来很棒
He takes very good care of you. No, I mean it. He does. You look fantastic.

504
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,042
你们俩看起来都很棒
You both look amazing.

505
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:01,665
很高兴 看到你很高兴
Wonderful, wonderful to see you.

506
00:39:01,834 --> 00:39:04,044
你知道吗 你生病的状态 很适合你
And you know, this invalid thing, it suits you.

507
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:06,419
是的 适合你 角色颠倒了
Yeah, no it does, 'cause the roles are reversed

508
00:39:06,584 --> 00:39:08,714
保罗可以反过来照顾你
and Paul can nurse you for a change.

509
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:11,919
哦 别啊 我不是那个意思
Oh, come on, I didn't mean it like that.

510
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:16,214
操 好的 好的
Fuck. Okay! Okay!

511
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:19,415
好的 好的 好的 漂亮的裙子 漂亮的裙子
All right, all right, all right. Nice dress, nice dress!

512
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:31,667
当然 好的 我会来见你的 可以吗
Of course. Yeah. I'll see you, yes?

513
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,365
拜拜 再见
Bye, see you.

514
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:42,997
你刚刚成了我的英雄
You were my hero until just now.

515
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:46,537
我很抱歉 我不能走太远 你还好吗
Yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't stay away. You all right?

516
00:39:46,709 --> 00:39:49,369
她只是让我感觉到超级无聊
She was just boring the life out of me is all.

517
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:52,502
- 你看上去并不无聊  - 是的 我知道 谢谢
- You didn't look bored.  - Yes, I know. Thank you.

518
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:58,705
我的问题是 我轻易能爱上任何美丽的东西
My trouble is that I fall in love with every pretty thing.

519
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,865
听起来很无力
That sounds paralysing.

520
00:40:03,292 --> 00:40:06,462
不要惊吓到马匹 我总是喜欢听你说这个
Try not to frighten the horses. I always loved you saying that.

521
00:40:07,459 --> 00:40:11,619
我觉得很有趣 因为总是你惊吓到那些马匹
It was always funny to me, 'cause you always frightened the fucking horses.

522
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:15,212
你 然而和保罗...
You, whereas with Paul...

523
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,825
保罗现在在你生命中是什么意义
What's the point of Paul in your life now?

524
00:40:23,584 --> 00:40:26,464
我对你很生气 是的 我知道我很浪荡
I was angry with you. Yeah, I know I was slutting around,

525
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:28,455
但你太认真了
but you took everything so hard

526
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:31,455
看看我现在做了什么 我…
and now look what I've done. I've...

527
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:33,615
我把你推给了一个木头
thrown you this square.

528
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:38,082
是的 他是木头 玛丽安 他是木头
Yeah, he's square, Marianne. He's a square bear.

529
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:43,120
他适合在休养生息的时候相处 他很呆板
He's all cuddly and built for hibernating with and he stuck.

530
00:40:45,084 --> 00:40:50,374
我很感激你把保罗介绍给我
I will always be grateful to you for Paul.

531
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,960
这个你怎么办 嗯
How are you dealing with this? Mm?

532
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:06,917
如果回不到从前了 怎么办
What if it doesn't come back?

533
00:41:10,625 --> 00:41:13,785
你知道的 它可能回不来了 你想过没有
You know, it might not come back. Have you thought about that?

534
00:41:14,792 --> 00:41:17,462
这是你的生命
It's your fucking life!

535
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:19,825
你的声音是你的生命
Your voice is your fucking life!

536
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,460
你又会涅槃重生 对吗
Bet that you'll just reinvent yourself again, won't you?

537
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:30,205
穿你母亲的衣服也是重生吗
Is wearing your mother's clothes, is that reinvention?

538
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:36,712
我不这么认为 不管怎样 你有你妈妈的阶段
I don't think so. Anyway, I suppose you'll have your mummy phase

539
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:38,865
我也有我爸爸的阶段
and I have my daddy phase.

540
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,460
但是至少 我们会一起变老 不会吗
But one way or another we're just going to grow old together, aren't we?

541
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
我很快乐 哈里
I'm happy, Harry.

542
00:41:55,334 --> 00:41:57,334
你不能忍受吗
Can't you stand that?

543
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:14,495
如果我说我想拍纪录片 你会觉得我在谄媚吗
Would you think I was being ingratiating if I said I wanted to make documentaries?

544
00:42:14,667 --> 00:42:18,787
拿上摄影机去曼苏拉（埃及地名）拍摄孩子们或别的东西
Just pick up a camera and go film the kids in Mansoura or something.

545
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:20,959
奥 你去过那里吗
Oh, have you been there?

546
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:25,002
- 这阻止不了我  - 嗯 你需要建议吗
- I wouldn't let that stop me.  - Well, you want some advice?

547
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,367
- 为什么 因为我是女孩吗  - 不是
- Why? Because I'm a girl?  - No.

548
00:42:27,542 --> 00:42:31,672
不是 你应该去曼苏拉 底特律 任何驱使你的地方
No, you should definitely go to Mansoura, or Detroit, whatever moves you.

549
00:42:31,834 --> 00:42:35,464
只不过不要像哈里那样 要保持低调 少说话
Just don't do it the Harry way. Just lay low, keep your mouth shut.

550
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:38,365
你知道的 别带摄影机 空手而去吧 我说真的
You know, don't take a camera. Go empty-handed, seriously.

551
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:42,172
相信我 不然的话你会让自己丢脸的 我知道这方面的任何东西
You'll humiliate yourself any other way, trust me. I know everything about it.

552
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:46,867
好吧 我不害怕
All right. I'm not afraid of that.

553
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,040
你想要吗
Do you want some?

554
00:42:54,209 --> 00:42:56,869
- 不 我不吸烟  - 并不意味着你不想要
- No. I don't smoke.  - Doesn't mean you don't want some.

555
00:42:57,042 --> 00:42:59,422
是的 我不想要
Yes, it does.

556
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:08,867
你车祸之后应该很绝望
You must have been really desperate to crash your car like that.

557
00:43:09,042 --> 00:43:10,622
什么意思
Excuse me?

558
00:43:10,792 --> 00:43:13,462
他说你甩出去很远
He said you were shot out of it, really far...

559
00:43:14,917 --> 00:43:17,787
你没留下任何字条什么的
and you didn't leave a note or anything.

560
00:43:18,792 --> 00:43:20,832
他这么说的？
That's what he said?

561
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:27,870
他认为这是你做的最有趣的事情
He thinks it's the most interesting thing you've done.

562
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:31,212
他认为你上瘾之后很逞能
He thinks you're too conceited to stand being addicted to anything.

563

671
00:53:06,084 --> 00:53:07,674
你需要个拖车 拖车才是你需要的
You need a tow truck. That's what you need.

- 哦 老天 你来不来  - 拖车
- Oh, Christ. Will you come or not?  - A tow truck.

673
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,170
他们两都说我是 但我不觉得他是
They both tell me yes, but I don't think he really is.

674
00:53:25,917 --> 00:53:30,997
我是说 我们的外貌和行为一点儿也不像
I mean, we don't even really look, or act very much alike at all.

675
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:36,745
我要叫他去做个鉴定
I'm going to ask him to take the test.

676

我有理由知道真相
There are reasons I'd like to know.

680
00:54:02,625 --> 00:54:04,665
你让我们两怎么推车子
How the hell do you want us to move that?

681
00:54:04,834 --> 00:54:06,834
哦 嗯 希望它不要向前就好
Oh, well, let's hope it won't roll forward.

682
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,460
我想 我们松开手刹 就能把它推回到路上
I think, if we release the handbrake, we can put it back on to the road.

683
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,504
好吧 我们推
All right, let's push it.

684
00:54:16,667 --> 00:54:18,457

692
00:54:41,375 --> 00:54:43,415

694
00:54:49,459 --> 00:54:51,829
作为一个摇滚歌手你太温和了
You're pretty domesticated for a rock star.

695
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:58,420
你为什么和哈里在一起 六年吗
You were with Harry for what, six years?

696

698
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:15,829
我听说之前的专辑唱片两面都有六首歌
I heard that there used to be six songs on either side of a record album.

699
00:55:17,875 --> 00:55:21,245
听完六首后 得翻一面继续听更多的
You'd hear six and then you'd have to flip the thing over to hear more.

700
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,667
你知道吗
You know what?

701
00:55:38,834 --> 00:55:42,964
我打赌他们在每一面都放一首特别好听的歌
I bet they put one really good song on each side,

702
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:45,785
所以你才会一直翻面听
so you just keep flipping it over.

703
00:55:47,667 --> 00:55:49,457
顺便问一下 你看到了我的iPod吗
By the way, have you seen my iPod?

704
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:52,785
因为那个鬼鬼祟祟的哈里总是想偷听
Because that sneaky Harry is always trying to get into it

705
00:55:52,959 --> 00:55:54,959
想知道我在听什么
to see what I've been listening to.

706
00:55:58,459 --> 00:56:00,369
所以你又开始工作了
So you're working again.

00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:31,124
你拍了所有的镜头 现在都躺在某个抽屉里吗
You shot all that footage. What is it, just lying in a drawer somewhere?

不 实际上在一个柜子里 5个硬盘 但是那个能等
No, actually it's in a closet. Five hard drives, but that can wait.

719
00:56:37,334 --> 00:56:40,334
嗯 调整自己的目标 不要想着改变世界

你给潘也是相同的建议吗
Is that the same advice you'd give Pen?

721
00:56:43,959 --> 00:56:47,829
不 她还年轻 她若有机会应该改变这个世界
No! She's young. She should change the world any chance she gets.

722
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,870
我认为现在女性应该改变一些东西了 我们男人已经有过这样的机会了
I think the women should change things now anyway. We've had our chance.

723
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,120
不管怎样 你还是会去做它的
Anyway, you will find your way back to it.

724

你需要筹集资金 好的剪辑 些许勇气
You just got to get your finance, good editor, some guts.

725

闭嘴 行不行
Just shut the fuck up, all right?

726
00:57:02,417 --> 00:57:05,577
别说了 我们就没事 你能做到吗
Just stop talking and we'll be fine. Can you do that?

我认为那是个很好的切入点
I thought it was a good observation.

729
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:17,245
这是你认为的 不是很严谨
It's the way you give it. It's not very careful.

730
00:57:17,417 --> 00:57:19,537
是啊 这正是我关心的 不是吗
Well, it's how I care, isn't it?

诚实是最大的尽责
Honesty is the greatest fidelity.

732
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:26,080
嗯 世界没准备好接受你的诚实
Yeah, well, the world is not ready for your honesty.

733
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:29,115
我不相信片面真理
I don't believe in half truths.

734
00:57:29,292 --> 00:57:31,292

Oh, you used to.

虽然为时已晚 但我受到教训了
Not in time, but I learned it.

737
00:57:36,584 --> 00:57:40,714
我觉得和玛丽安分手是我傻透一生的傻透了的决定
I think going bust with Marianne was the great dumb tragedy of my great dumb life.

738
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,115
跟你说出来感觉好多了
It feels good to say it to you.

739
00:57:45,917 --> 00:57:47,917
你受到教训还不晚 不是吗
You learned your lesson in time, though, didn't you?

740
00:57:48,084 --> 00:57:50,084
我是说 这才是重要的
I mean, that's the important thing.

如果保罗说 我肯定要和他打架
Coming from Paul, this would be outrageous.

786

保罗是保罗 但从你嘴里说出来 我…
Paul is Paul, but coming from you, it's...

787
01:02:59,084 --> 01:03:02,544
我是说 你的意图是什么 羞辱我还是...

真的 到底是什么
What is it, really?

789
01:03:05,459 --> 01:03:09,289
哈里 这不是关于我们之间的事

862
01:15:50,167 --> 01:15:52,167
我爱你
I love you.

863
01:16:01,209 --> 01:16:03,869
我们不应该再见面了
Then we shouldn't see each other anymore.

864
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:31,502
六年级的时候 我们学校有歌剧课
In sixth grade, they offered an opera class at my school

865
01:16:31,667 --> 01:16:33,667
我完全着迷了
and I was hooked.

866
01:16:33,834 --> 01:16:37,674
La Mamma Morta（意大利歌剧曲目） “我是爱 我是爱”
La Mamma Morta. "I'm love. I'm love."

867
01:16:37,834 --> 01:16:40,214
我不得不学习意大利语
I had to conquer all things Italian after that.

868
01:16:40,375 --> 01:16:43,245
啊 我们想不等你们就开动了
Ah. We were going to start without you.

869
01:16:43,417 --> 01:16:45,417
很抱歉 我们有点迷路了
I'm sorry. We got kind of lost.

870
01:16:45,584 --> 01:16:47,374
啊哈
Uh-huh.

871
01:16:51,792 --> 01:16:53,582
潘 请传帕尔玛奶酪给我
Parmigiano please, Pen.

872
01:16:58,917 --> 01:17:00,537
谢谢
Thanks.

873
01:17:00,709 --> 01:17:03,499
所以你俩应该饿坏了 你们还游泳了 对吗
So you two must be starving. You went swimming as well, no?

874
01:17:04,667 --> 01:17:07,327
- 是的  - 在哪里 湖里吗
- We did.  - Where? At the lake?

875
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:10,790
嗯 没 事实是 呃 保罗带我去了悬崖
Um, no, actually, uh, Paul took us to the cliffs.

876
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:12,579
哦
Oh.

877
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:16,250
我们一直玩跳水
We dived and dived and dived.

878
01:17:16,417 --> 01:17:17,707
风怎么样
How was the wind?

879
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:21,825
可以肯定的是 我需要勺子从眼里把沙子挖出来
I'll need a spoon to scrape the sand out of my eyes, that's for sure.

880
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,500
嗯哼
Mm-hm.

881
01:17:26,834 --> 01:17:30,834
嗯 你终于到了海滩 或多或少
Well, you got your beach, then, more or less.

882
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,580
比海滩好多了
It was better than a beach.

883
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:35,620
真有一些海滩在这边
Actually, there are a couple of beaches here,

884
01:17:35,792 --> 01:17:39,252
微型海滩之类的 我不知道他们怎么称呼它
like micro beaches or something. I don't know what they call them.

885
01:17:39,417 --> 01:17:42,417
真的很小 只能容下三四个人 很漂亮
But really tiny, just for three or four people. It's beautiful.

886
01:17:42,584 --> 01:17:45,174
你在那可以干任何你想做的事情
You can do anything you like out there really.

887
01:17:45,334 --> 01:17:47,924
等风小点儿 我们可以去玩
If the wind dies down, that's what we do next.

888
01:17:48,084 --> 01:17:49,874
你们会爱上它的
You'd love it.

889
01:17:53,667 --> 01:17:56,827
我想问 是玛丽安做的吗
By the way, did Marianne make this?

890
01:17:58,167 --> 01:18:00,827
- 是的  - 太棒了 我能分辨出来
- Yeah.  - This is so good, I can tell.

891
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,670
香菜 这是她的标志 她做任何东西都会放它
Cilantro. That's her signature. She'll put it in anything.

892
01:18:07,292 --> 01:18:09,422
什么 真的吗
What? Will she?

893
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:11,424
是的
Yeah.

894
01:18:12,542 --> 01:18:16,672
还有 潘泰莱里亚人总说 人们吃很多酸豆
By the way, they always say in Pantelleria, people eat a lot of capers,

895
01:18:16,834 --> 01:18:20,004
但我们至今还没吃过 对吗
but so far we haven't eaten any, right?

896
01:18:21,209 --> 01:18:22,789
哦 我吃了
Oh, I have.

897
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,830
讨厌的壁虎 操
Fucking gecko, shit!

898
01:18:40,167 --> 01:18:43,617
我想我去看部电影或啥的
I think I'm going to go watch a movie or something.

899
01:18:45,625 --> 01:18:48,205
- 你还好吗  - 是的 你呢
- Are you good?  - Yeah, are you?

900
01:18:48,375 --> 01:18:51,365
是的 我今天很累了
Yeah, I'm just beat from the day.

901
01:18:52,959 --> 01:18:54,959

906
01:19:14,542 --> 01:19:17,122
她只是累了 是漫长的一天
She's just tired. It was a long day.

907
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:19,955
嗯

游泳...
Swimming...

909
01:19:28,834 --> 01:19:30,674
游泳很消耗体力
Swimming can take it out of you.

910
01:19:35,542 --> 01:19:38,922
你们今天过得怎样 好吗
How was your day? Any good?

911

is I gave you too much credit. We were friends.

952
01:25:36,334 --> 01:25:37,794
比兄弟更好
Better than brothers.

953
01:25:37,959 --> 01:25:41,789
比生活在一个屋檐下假装互相关心的人更好
Better than all those shits in their lofts talking about who the fuck cares what

954
01:25:41,959 --> 01:25:46,079
然而现在你只是...你只是在忍受我
And now you just... you just tolerate me.

你知道这对我是多么大的冒犯吗
Do you know how offensive that is to me?

956
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:54,290
你想什么都可以 批评我也可以 但是不要忍受我
Think what you want, judge the hell out of me, but don't fucking tolerate me.

957
01:25:57,959 --> 01:26:00,539
- 你不配她们任何一个人  - 你也不配
- You don't deserve either of them.  - Neither do you.

958
01:26:00,709 --> 01:26:04,829
你不知道我把她从什么鬼地方拉出来 远离出来
You have no idea of the shit that I got her out of... off of.

959
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,580
嗯 我是她远离你
Well, I got her off you.

960
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:09,920
什么 我把她交给你
What? I gave her to you.

961
01:26:15,834 --> 01:26:17,464
你太下流了
You're obscene.

962
01:26:17,625 --> 01:26:19,575
我们都下流
We're all obscene.

963
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:23,370
所有人都下流 说到点子上了
Everyone's obscene. That's the whole fucking point.

964
01:26:23,542 --> 01:26:25,922
我们明白了 不管怎样我们互相喜欢
We see it and we love each other anyway.

965
01:26:26,084 --> 01:26:29,374
喜欢？ 我在想你花多长时间去…
Love? I was wondering how long it would take you to pull that...

All right, Paul.

969
01:26:49,959 --> 01:26:52,539
我也不知道自己在做什么
I don't know what I'm doing either.

970
01:26:52,709 --> 01:26:54,119
来 帮我上去 行吗
Here, help me out, will you?

971
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:56,292
