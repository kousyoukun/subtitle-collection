1
00:00:53,612 --> 00:00:56,922
ANATOMY

2
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:33,484
Kaminsky! Gloves!

3
00:01:33,612 --> 00:01:36,365
This woman is educational material,
not a fellow student.

4
00:01:38,212 --> 00:01:41,443
Kaminsky, you old lecher.
Why don't you try it with live women?

5
00:01:41,532 --> 00:01:44,285
Just when I finally found fresh meat....

6
00:01:44,732 --> 00:01:47,087
From tomorrow on,
it'll be river corpses again.

7
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:48,082
Professor?

8
00:01:48,532 --> 00:01:51,330
We found an anatomic anomaly
in the abdominal area.

9
00:01:51,772 --> 00:01:53,251
A penis, perhaps?

10
00:01:55,052 --> 00:02:01,685
That isn't an anomaly. Men are different
from you women. May l?

11
00:02:06,052 --> 00:02:07,167
These things are slippery.

12
00:02:11,092 --> 00:02:12,161
Yes?

13
00:02:17,372 --> 00:02:22,446
Paula Henning, 783 points
in the 1999 Robert Koch Contest.

14
00:02:23,452 --> 00:02:25,329
The second best score in the country.

15
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,047
Congratulations!

16
00:02:28,172 --> 00:02:31,005
Does that mean that I've been accepted
into Heidelberg?

17
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:33,560
Yes. If you prefer to spend your summer
with corpses...

18
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:35,325
...instead of with young men.

19
00:02:35,972 --> 00:02:39,601
Grombek's course in anatomy
is the very best.

20
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:42,968
A test of will.
Really intensive. Fully focused.

21
00:02:43,092 --> 00:02:46,243
I wanted to go to ltaly,
but this is obviously--

22
00:02:46,652 --> 00:02:48,961
This is such a chance, with your talent!

23
00:02:49,172 --> 00:02:51,208
And you want to go
to ltaly for the summer?

24
00:02:51,292 --> 00:02:54,329
In ltaly there's a lot of fondling, too.

25
00:02:54,492 --> 00:02:55,925
Yes! Exactly.

26
00:02:58,252 --> 00:02:59,367
Good bye.

27
00:03:03,612 --> 00:03:04,761
Excuse me.

28
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:06,521
Excuse me.

29
00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:11,524
-So?
-Heidelberg!

30
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:52,447
Hi, Grandpa.

31
00:03:53,612 --> 00:03:56,524
Listen, your transaminase level is high...

32
00:03:56,892 --> 00:04:01,283
...and I just heard, that they're
considering hemofiltration.

33
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:06,164
They want to increase morphine to 5 ml,
but they still have to ask Schützenberger.

34
00:04:07,492 --> 00:04:09,130
Does it hurt that much?

35
00:04:09,212 --> 00:04:11,442
Paula, I've been dead since Christmas.

36
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,286
They're just torturing me
with the machines...

37
00:04:14,372 --> 00:04:17,284
...that I myself bought as head physician.

38
00:04:18,252 --> 00:04:20,447
Your score in the Robert Koch Contest?

39
00:04:20,532 --> 00:04:23,410
Over 700. Second best result
in the country.

40
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:26,484
Very good. So? Heidelberg.

41
00:04:26,772 --> 00:04:29,764
-I don't want to leave you alone.
-I don't need a keener.

42
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,685
Nothing could make me happier
than to know...

43
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,161
...that my Paula will be a physician.

44
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:38,290
Not someone who applies bandages
or a hospital bureaucrat...

45
00:04:38,532 --> 00:04:41,604
...but a true physician. My successor.

46
00:04:42,972 --> 00:04:44,724
I'm so proud of you.

47
00:04:47,492 --> 00:04:49,562
I have to go, Grandpa. Bye.

48
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:53,322
Would you pull the plug from the socket?

49
00:04:59,652 --> 00:05:00,607
Heidelberg?

50
00:05:01,852 --> 00:05:05,162
Those red spots are only crab lice.
Don't worry, Nellie.

51
00:05:08,012 --> 00:05:10,162
Dad, this is the chance of a lifetime!

52
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,331
Put some of that on it.

53
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:16,082
You could be happy for me at least once.

54
00:05:16,172 --> 00:05:18,322
I thought you would help me
in the practice.

55
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,804
That's what you promised me, once.

56
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:24,521
The course in research with Grombek
I told you about....

57
00:05:25,452 --> 00:05:27,920
If you pass, you can work
in any research centre--

58
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:30,970
In any elegant private clinic.

59
00:05:31,652 --> 00:05:35,122
The purpose of human suffering
is to make doctors rich and famous.

60
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:38,805
I just want a top education--

61
00:05:38,892 --> 00:05:41,770
-Kevin has such a terrible cough.
-Nellie, don't touch that!

62
00:05:43,772 --> 00:05:45,728
I want a career,
even if you think it's stupid.

63
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,201
I don't want to end up in such a....

64
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:52,488
Yes, go on.

65
00:05:57,252 --> 00:06:00,369
At least take the blue one with you.
Maybe you'll go out.

66
00:06:01,052 --> 00:06:03,122
Mom, I'm going to Heidelberg for work.

67
00:06:03,212 --> 00:06:05,009
Taking a dress with you doesn't mean....

68
00:06:05,092 --> 00:06:07,526
I'm not going to get pregnant
and ruin my career.

69
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:10,847
Thanks. That's really nice of you.

70
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,361
Mom, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

71
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:18,208
Did you apologise to Dad?

72
00:06:19,372 --> 00:06:21,090
I really try, but hearing him say...

73
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,403
...that successful people are criminals,
just because he's only a--

74
00:06:24,532 --> 00:06:26,648
Even if Dad can't stand his father...

75
00:06:26,732 --> 00:06:28,768
...he should visit him at least once.

76
00:06:28,852 --> 00:06:30,763
He's really in bad shape.

77
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:38,724
Will you write to me?

78
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:42,126
Mom, this is going to be great!

79
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:13,845
Where am l?

80
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:17,521
He's awake.

81
00:07:17,612 --> 00:07:21,002
-Are we ready for anaesthesia?
-Circulation is fine. 2 mg Promidal.

82
00:07:21,772 --> 00:07:24,764
Did you already take a look at the list?

83
00:07:26,892 --> 00:07:28,610
Was there anything interesting?

84
00:07:30,412 --> 00:07:33,370
-What are you doing?
-The person from Berlin.

85
00:07:44,012 --> 00:07:45,081
Henning?

86
00:07:53,852 --> 00:07:55,888
Paula or Petra. Excellent grades.

87
00:08:00,852 --> 00:08:04,288
A woman would be a novelty, for once.

88
00:08:05,132 --> 00:08:08,204
We could get in touch with her.

89
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,806
When she arrives in Heidelberg.

90
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,280
DISSECTING ROOM

91
00:08:45,572 --> 00:08:48,086
Hey, we met in Munich.

92
00:08:48,252 --> 00:08:50,447
Yes. You were
in the Professor's course, too.

93
00:08:50,532 --> 00:08:52,284
The six-handed anatomist, yes.

94
00:08:52,372 --> 00:08:55,887
-I feel uncomfortable when he....
-Well, I just let him do it a little.

95
00:08:55,972 --> 00:08:58,645
At least that way I avoid
his second class courses.

96
00:08:58,732 --> 00:09:01,530
He wouldn't actually have the nerve
to fondle your breasts.

97
00:09:01,612 --> 00:09:04,365
-Are you going to Heidelberg, too?
-Yes.

98
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:06,568
-Why, "too"?
-Let's rent a room together.

99
00:09:06,652 --> 00:09:08,324
I'll bet there are nice guys there...

100
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:10,648
...even if they're doctors.

101
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:13,371
But who knows?

102
00:09:19,212 --> 00:09:21,362
A doctor! ls there a doctor here?

103
00:09:27,412 --> 00:09:28,765
He fell. Because of the heat.

104
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:33,050
Hello? Can you hear me? Relax.

105
00:09:33,132 --> 00:09:36,522
Can you hear me?

106
00:09:56,772 --> 00:09:58,251
Are you okay?

107
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,409
Can you hear me? Do you feel all right?

108
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:02,289
Empty a compartment. Hurry!

109
00:10:02,372 --> 00:10:05,205
You finally realise why you actually study
all this shit.

110
00:10:05,412 --> 00:10:07,926
That wasn't a fainting spell.
It was cardiac arrest.

111
00:10:08,012 --> 00:10:11,800
It's called cardiomyopathy.
Advanced heart insufficiency.

112
00:10:11,972 --> 00:10:13,883
Big heart, small valves.

113
00:10:13,972 --> 00:10:17,044
Besides falling down dead every now
and then, it's no trouble.

114
00:10:17,132 --> 00:10:20,124
Would you like my corpse?
It's a unique object for study.

115
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:23,963
Before that,
we'll have to test all your vital functions.

116
00:10:25,252 --> 00:10:27,766
I'll meet the 435th specialist
or miracle healer...

117
00:10:28,572 --> 00:10:30,722
...tonight in some pub.

118
00:10:31,252 --> 00:10:33,482
They only get excited over rare illnesses.

119
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:36,764
-I'm beyond help.
-Don't talk that way. Modern medicine--

120
00:10:36,892 --> 00:10:40,089
Here's my number. We practice medicine
in pubs, discos or cinemas...

121
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,288
...and if you need....

122
00:10:43,652 --> 00:10:46,962
-Well, thanks.
-Good luck.

123
00:10:59,412 --> 00:11:04,725
The poor guy. I didn't know,
that you could get that disease so young.

124
00:11:45,452 --> 00:11:47,124
So you're from Munich, too?

125
00:11:47,932 --> 00:11:50,605
I'll put you both together
in one apartment, okay?

126
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:53,684
No alcoholic beverages, no pets.
Male visitors are allowed.

127
00:11:54,332 --> 00:11:56,641
You'll have to organise that
on your own, though.

128
00:11:56,732 --> 00:11:58,085
By the way, my name is Philip.

129
00:11:58,172 --> 00:11:59,525
I'm always phiril.

130
00:11:59,972 --> 00:12:03,408
-A play on words. How sweet.
-Excuse me?

131
00:12:09,012 --> 00:12:10,127
Cute.

132
00:12:17,132 --> 00:12:20,204
Hi, is anyone there? All anatomy students,
to the dissecting room.

133
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:22,442
In the new wing. Hurry!

134
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:36,170
The dissecting room is here, isn't it?

135
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:41,441
Excuse me. Are you here
for the introduction?

136
00:12:41,532 --> 00:12:43,568
-We're going to the anatomy course.
-Exactly.

137
00:12:43,652 --> 00:12:45,290
I believe it's over there.

138
00:13:01,972 --> 00:13:03,121
Great!

139
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,164
This looks cool.

140
00:13:35,812 --> 00:13:37,643
Maybe we're too early.

141
00:13:45,212 --> 00:13:48,522
-My name is Paula. Paula Henning.
-Hi. I'm Gretchen.

142
00:13:49,172 --> 00:13:51,766
-Gabi. University of Tübingen.
-Tübingen!

143
00:13:52,012 --> 00:13:54,162
I had a really sweet boyfriend over there.

144
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:57,722
We're both from Munich,
but we don't belong together.

145
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:00,804
Am I crazy or....

146
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:09,284
I thought I saw movement or something.

147
00:14:11,372 --> 00:14:13,090
That's rather unlikely.

148
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:24,325
So, what was your boyfriend's name?

149
00:14:27,652 --> 00:14:29,483
The one from Tübingen?

150
00:14:36,052 --> 00:14:40,967
Very funny. Scaring a couple of chicks!

151
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:43,322
A welcoming ritual in Heidelberg?

152
00:14:54,612 --> 00:14:59,527
Nonsense. What cannot exist,
doesn't exist.

153
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:04,484
A corpse can't move.

154
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,562
It's a corpse, not a doll.

155
00:15:14,132 --> 00:15:15,929
How does a body move?

156
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:21,210
A contraction of muscles
produced by nerve impulses.

157
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,208
And how do nerves function?

158
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:30,889
Electrical impulse.
An impulse can be induced.

159
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:44,002
Nerves stimulated by electrical impulses
produce muscular contractions.

160
00:15:44,092 --> 00:15:45,571
That implies movement.

161
00:15:49,132 --> 00:15:50,645
That is logical.

162
00:15:54,612 --> 00:15:57,251
There is a scientific explanation
for everything.

163
00:15:58,212 --> 00:16:02,603
All you need is a high voltage cable.
That paralyses the whole network.

164
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:05,690
What are you doing?
Using a corpse as a toy train?

165
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:09,365
No trace of ethics, you stupid assholes.

166
00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:14,009
I'll get you sooner or later.

167
00:16:15,052 --> 00:16:16,280
Asshole!

168
00:16:31,252 --> 00:16:33,925
Those from Heidelberg already
have Grombek the whole year.

169
00:16:34,012 --> 00:16:36,606
Hard, but unfair. The perfect sadist.

170
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:40,608
He's brilliant in his field, though.
Who is your professor?

171
00:16:41,132 --> 00:16:45,205
I was with Botticelli in Berlin.
Now I'm doing my AIP at the Sorbonne.

172
00:16:46,332 --> 00:16:47,651
Huber, Munich.

173
00:16:47,972 --> 00:16:51,647
-Kledermann, Emden.
-What? There's no university in Emden.

174
00:16:51,852 --> 00:16:54,685
There's a butcher shop.
My uncle is a butcher.

175
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:55,961
He slices like a God.

176
00:16:56,092 --> 00:16:59,289
Seriously. There, you learn the difference
between tripe and steak.

177
00:16:59,372 --> 00:17:01,647
-A difference of at least 30 DM.
-But...

178
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:05,085
-...a doctor, I mean....
-Meat is meat and has its price.

179
00:17:05,172 --> 00:17:08,608
Heart costs more than liver,
liposuction less than breast surgery.

180
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:12,367
Medicine is a service,
and we all want to earn well, don't we?

181
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:28,804
-I'm from Heidelberg too.
-Really?

182
00:17:28,972 --> 00:17:31,042
Specialised in anabolism.

183
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:35,811
But call me anyway,
the next time you're naked.

184
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:40,641
Actually I'm a charming person.

185
00:17:41,012 --> 00:17:44,448
I love bird calls and know the names
of many flowers.

186
00:17:45,212 --> 00:17:47,362
But I'm a doctor.

187
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:50,041
-Caspar.
-Paula Henning.

188
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:53,123
Your grandfather was dean here, right?

189
00:17:53,212 --> 00:17:56,090
Basic Neurological Anatomy.
Heidelberg '57.

190
00:17:58,052 --> 00:17:59,849
That's a nice dimple.

191
00:18:24,492 --> 00:18:27,086
Has your date still not shown up?

192
00:18:27,452 --> 00:18:29,920
-Where's the restroom?
-Come with me. I'll show you.

193
00:18:38,052 --> 00:18:39,167
In there.

194
00:19:34,012 --> 00:19:35,968
Drunks! He has probably puked all over.

195
00:19:40,692 --> 00:19:43,206
-Ciao bello.
-Bye.

196
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:48,570
His name's Hein and let me tell you
he's all muscle!

197
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,723
He takes himself so seriously.

198
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:58,445
Today you got close
to your sweetheart, too.

199
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,482
-My what?
-The tall, dark one. Caspar.

200
00:20:01,572 --> 00:20:05,645
-It was so obvious that....
-Oh God! Stop chattering about men.

201
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:08,650
You're obsessed.
I'm here to work, not to fuck around.

202
00:20:08,892 --> 00:20:10,041
That's too bad.

203
00:20:37,692 --> 00:20:39,444
Do you know what time it is?

204
00:20:41,172 --> 00:20:42,924
Is he still unconscious?

205
00:20:49,652 --> 00:20:53,361
Pay attention. We make the incision here,
alongside the arteries near the heart.

206
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:57,808
That way, we expose the heart laterally.

207
00:21:41,612 --> 00:21:43,523
Help! ls anyone here?

208
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:18,923
Too bad. He's dead.
We can't use him anymore.

209
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:22,767
-Injured?
-No. Just a scratch.

210
00:22:24,772 --> 00:22:26,364
Now what do we do with it?

211
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:33,607
Our highly modernised society
tends to reduce everything...

212
00:22:33,692 --> 00:22:35,683
...to problems of the soul.

213
00:22:36,252 --> 00:22:40,643
The doctor, who simply cuts away
a disease, doesn't count anymore.

214
00:22:41,692 --> 00:22:45,651
I'm fond of saying that people prefer
to die in one piece...

215
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:48,849
...rather than be cured
by traditional medicine.

216
00:22:50,132 --> 00:22:52,885
Here, in the new wing of the institute...

217
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:56,282
...a most modern dissecting room is
at your complete disposal.

218
00:22:56,372 --> 00:23:00,684
No pain has been relieved yet in this room.
No patient has been cured.

219
00:23:00,892 --> 00:23:03,531
We are laying the foundations
for that here.

220
00:23:04,412 --> 00:23:06,403
Discoveries are being made...

221
00:23:06,492 --> 00:23:08,926
...which save the lives
of people out there...

222
00:23:09,052 --> 00:23:11,168
...or at least make them easier to bear.

223
00:23:11,652 --> 00:23:14,564
The basis of medicine.

224
00:23:17,332 --> 00:23:20,244
Ladies and gentlemen,
we believe you are the best.

225
00:23:20,772 --> 00:23:24,651
You are the elite,
the future of our profession.

226
00:23:25,652 --> 00:23:28,371
A third or even half of you won't be
with us anymore...

227
00:23:28,452 --> 00:23:30,443
...after we have given the results.

228
00:23:30,532 --> 00:23:33,205
Be grateful for this apparent inflexibility.

229
00:23:34,052 --> 00:23:36,646
Strict selection guarantees
our high academic level...

230
00:23:36,732 --> 00:23:40,042
...and the reputation of this institution.

231
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:47,649
As you can see, Heidelberg traditionally
has a fine collection of specimens.

232
00:23:48,212 --> 00:23:52,000
This collection is at the exclusive disposal
of all scientists...

233
00:23:52,092 --> 00:23:56,688
...and students.
It is invaluable for science and education.

234
00:24:02,892 --> 00:24:06,043
My God. Fantastic.

235
00:24:11,732 --> 00:24:14,451
Wow. Are these models?

236
00:24:14,612 --> 00:24:17,126
No, no. These are real human specimens.
Plastimised.

237
00:24:17,612 --> 00:24:20,285
All fat and water has been extracted
from the tissue.

238
00:24:20,412 --> 00:24:22,403
They are preserved for eternity.

239
00:24:33,692 --> 00:24:36,365
Heidelberg University - Kidney
Specimen by: Dr. E. Henning

240
00:24:36,452 --> 00:24:38,841
Ewald Henning. That's my grandpa.

241
00:24:39,292 --> 00:24:42,329
Colleague, we're glad to know
that your grandfather is so famous.

242
00:24:43,132 --> 00:24:45,521
Your achievements, however,
must be your own.

243
00:25:00,772 --> 00:25:04,287
Immediately afterwards,
you will receive your research topics.

244
00:25:05,452 --> 00:25:08,842
You will hand in a paper on them
at the end of the course.

245
00:25:08,932 --> 00:25:11,605
In addition, there will be mid-term exams.

246
00:25:11,692 --> 00:25:13,728
The first one in three weeks...

247
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:17,122
...after which, the six least prepared
students will go home.

248
00:25:17,532 --> 00:25:20,842
The same will happen
after the second mid-term exam.

249
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:25,808
Lectures will be held every day
from 7:30 a.m. to 12:00 a.m.

250
00:25:25,972 --> 00:25:31,410
The dissecting room, library and laboratory
are at your disposal from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.

251
00:25:32,092 --> 00:25:35,687
Evenings and weekends are to be used
for studying.

252
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,161
David.

253
00:25:52,532 --> 00:25:56,411
I think it's 10 years
since I last smoked a cigarette.

254
00:25:58,332 --> 00:26:01,961
The last time during summer camp,
secretly, beneath a blanket.

255
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:06,251
Summer camp? Do you want to know
what I did there secretly?

256
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,370
Under a blanket?

257
00:26:14,212 --> 00:26:16,931
I didn't like the taste then, either.

258
00:26:25,772 --> 00:26:29,367
Damn. I could still see the signs
of my cardiac massage on David's chest.

259
00:26:31,852 --> 00:26:33,171
Wonderful.

260
00:26:38,812 --> 00:26:42,168
Can we plastimise the heart and
circulatory system as specimens?

261
00:26:42,532 --> 00:26:45,888
Now? Their structure is
no longer clearly defined.

262
00:26:46,412 --> 00:26:49,051
Once decomposition begins....

263
00:26:49,372 --> 00:26:52,489
You have an interesting acquaintance here.
Take a look.

264
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:57,208
In his condition, it's a miracle he was alive,
not to mention the aneurysm.

265
00:26:57,652 --> 00:26:59,005
Inoperable.

266
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:03,166
Would you like to remove the heart?

267
00:27:05,972 --> 00:27:09,408
If it's too much for you emotionally,
as a woman....

268
00:27:11,652 --> 00:27:15,611
We save a human life and shortly
afterwards it's lost all the same.

269
00:27:15,972 --> 00:27:17,246
We are doctors.

270
00:27:17,332 --> 00:27:19,926
What are these stab wounds or cuts
in the abdomen?

271
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:22,810
Only medical instruments are this sharp.

272
00:27:23,772 --> 00:27:27,242
I guess they must have been caused
by a clumsy dissector.

273
00:27:36,772 --> 00:27:37,807
Asshole.

274
00:27:37,892 --> 00:27:41,646
I can't believe that David died so quickly
because of this tumour.

275
00:27:41,852 --> 00:27:43,888
Look at his neck, at the jugular vein.

276
00:27:44,092 --> 00:27:45,605
The blood is like gum.

277
00:27:45,812 --> 00:27:48,565
And what does that have to do
with cardiomyopathy?

278
00:27:49,052 --> 00:27:50,690
Absolutely nothing.

279
00:27:50,852 --> 00:27:53,491
David was terminally ill.
You couldn't have saved him.

280
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:56,040
You're imagining things
because of your guilt feelings.

281
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,327
We're here to examine corpses, right?

282
00:27:59,212 --> 00:28:02,249
-Shall I open the skull?
-Not yet. Thank you.

283
00:28:04,372 --> 00:28:06,806
I must manage to examine him
in the standard way...

284
00:28:06,892 --> 00:28:09,042
...otherwise I can forget about medicine.

285
00:28:10,612 --> 00:28:12,409
I'll do an analysis.

286
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,088
Professor? Miss Henning.

287
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:43,246
Colleague. Come in.

288
00:28:44,012 --> 00:28:45,968
Wow, it's fantastic here.

289
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:50,529
This is a central American
Papilio demoleus.

290
00:28:52,692 --> 00:28:54,648
Wonderful! It's so light, so lively.

291
00:28:55,412 --> 00:28:59,041
About David, I just want to know
that there was nothing I could have done.

292
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:02,809
Your reactions were clear,
correct, scientific.

293
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:07,565
In my time we called this "composure."
Impressive.

294
00:29:07,652 --> 00:29:10,803
-Yes. It seemed somehow strange that--
-We both know...

295
00:29:11,572 --> 00:29:14,040
...that you had personal motives.
Emotions.

296
00:29:14,492 --> 00:29:16,130
Female intuition.

297
00:29:16,892 --> 00:29:19,122
Further involvement would be...

298
00:29:19,812 --> 00:29:21,131
...silly.

299
00:29:21,812 --> 00:29:23,928
-But--
-Would you like some tea?

300
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,924
Otherwise Mrs. Erhardt will prepare
a cup of coffee...

301
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:30,005
...biscuits and a slice of pie.

302
00:29:30,412 --> 00:29:31,686
We're closing the case.

303
00:29:45,332 --> 00:29:47,892
-It doesn't exist.
-That's why I'm calling, Bernie.

304
00:29:48,132 --> 00:29:50,726
I've never seen blood with
such strange consistency.

305
00:29:50,892 --> 00:29:53,406
The process must have begun before death.

306
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:56,848
-There are no clots?
-No. It's more like...

307
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,201
...gum.

308
00:29:58,332 --> 00:30:01,642
Was your friend greenish, rather small
and with antennae on its head?

309
00:30:02,012 --> 00:30:03,331
Why green?

310
00:30:04,532 --> 00:30:05,601
Let's be serious.

311
00:30:05,692 --> 00:30:08,764
I'll send you a sample,
and you check it in biochemistry.

312
00:30:09,092 --> 00:30:11,481
A tissue sample?

313
00:30:12,732 --> 00:30:16,202
-Yes. I'll try to get one for you.
-Bernie needs fresh meat.

314
00:30:17,452 --> 00:30:20,171
-Liver, if possible. What do I get for it?
-A kiss.

315
00:30:20,732 --> 00:30:24,247
-A French kiss and I get to fondle you.
-On the forehead, and no fondling.

316
00:30:25,692 --> 00:30:27,569
-Bye, little one.
-Bye, old man.

317
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,125
Your father?

318
00:30:30,532 --> 00:30:32,841
-Yes, l--
-You seem to have a good relationship.

319
00:30:33,492 --> 00:30:36,768
No, it was a friend.
Not my boyfriend, my.... Damn.

320
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:40,601
-Purely scientific?
-I'm always....

321
00:30:43,332 --> 00:30:45,846
You think you're really great, don't you?

322
00:30:45,972 --> 00:30:48,406
I think you're really great, too.

323
00:30:51,052 --> 00:30:52,724
Come here and take a look.

324
00:30:57,292 --> 00:30:58,520
Take a look.

325
00:30:58,612 --> 00:31:00,125
This is the young man's blood.

326
00:31:00,212 --> 00:31:02,043
Have you seen anything like this before?

327
00:31:02,132 --> 00:31:04,566
It has nothing to do with the tumour.

328
00:31:05,092 --> 00:31:07,447
-I have to go to the dissecting room.
-What, now?

329
00:31:07,652 --> 00:31:09,085
To get some tissue samples.

330
00:31:09,172 --> 00:31:11,640
After the weekend it would be too late
for toxicology.

331
00:31:11,732 --> 00:31:13,563
What did you actually want?

332
00:31:14,012 --> 00:31:17,687
Well, cinema, ice cream parlour,
dissecting intestines, something romantic.

333
00:31:19,412 --> 00:31:22,529
Okay. In one hour down in the dormitory.

334
00:31:30,772 --> 00:31:35,004
Nonsense. Corpses look the same at night
as during the day.

335
00:31:38,972 --> 00:31:41,486
It's just the university building.

336
00:33:25,052 --> 00:33:27,850
-What are you doing?
-I wanted--

337
00:33:28,332 --> 00:33:29,128
Student?

338
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:34,090
-Name?
-Paula. Paula Henning.

339
00:33:34,452 --> 00:33:38,161
-I just wanted....
-Does the professor know?

340
00:33:42,212 --> 00:33:45,648
Yes, of course.
He himself said that I should....

341
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:48,647
David. I mean, number seven....

342
00:33:49,532 --> 00:33:51,011
I need to know who sent him here.

343
00:33:51,092 --> 00:33:53,162
I need to talk to the doctor in charge.

344
00:34:10,292 --> 00:34:13,409
Twenty-two-year-old male.
Cardiomyopathy.

345
00:34:14,772 --> 00:34:18,526
-Yes, and who--
-That's classified information.

346
00:34:22,012 --> 00:34:24,810
I really must know who sent him here.

347
00:34:36,852 --> 00:34:40,606
Yes. It's me. Someone was just here.

348
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,565
CREMATORIUM

349
00:35:04,372 --> 00:35:06,681
I got a tissue sample.

350
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:10,011
Something's going on, I'll tell you!

351
00:35:10,372 --> 00:35:12,886
I absolutely must find the doctor
who sent David here.

352
00:35:13,332 --> 00:35:16,369
The dissector has a list stating
the origin of the corpses.

353
00:35:16,452 --> 00:35:19,091
If there were any way
I could get that list....

354
00:35:26,812 --> 00:35:30,725
You're a good kisser, but your sweater
smells like formalin.

355
00:35:35,452 --> 00:35:37,568
Are you coming to the pond tomorrow?

356
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:41,407
Damned corpses! I'm dead tired!

357
00:35:53,412 --> 00:35:58,361
I took part in a contest
and wrote the second best paper.

358
00:36:03,052 --> 00:36:05,964
How did you get accepted here
in Heidelberg?

359
00:36:06,052 --> 00:36:07,883
I wrote the best paper.

360
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:14,045
In the Robert Koch Contest
for the advanced semester?

361
00:36:14,652 --> 00:36:17,120
This year, I won for the third time.

362
00:36:18,172 --> 00:36:20,049
Do you think a man can still get it up...

363
00:36:20,172 --> 00:36:23,289
...when he finds out that my IQ is
50 points higher than his is?

364
00:36:24,452 --> 00:36:26,044
But, I mean....

365
00:36:29,372 --> 00:36:31,727
-Why Hein?
-We need something besides work.

366
00:36:31,812 --> 00:36:33,006
And Hein is great.

367
00:36:37,492 --> 00:36:38,686
Yes, come here!

368
00:36:39,372 --> 00:36:41,283
-What is it?
-Turn around.

369
00:36:43,852 --> 00:36:46,525
There. Latissimus. Beautifully defined.

370
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:48,842
The retro spina and here--

371
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,448
-Gretchen. Stop it!
-Flex it.

372
00:36:52,372 --> 00:36:56,968
Glutaeus maximus. Great!
Thank you, sweetie.

373
00:36:57,412 --> 00:37:00,006
We always get these wrinkled,
old guys in pathology.

374
00:37:00,772 --> 00:37:04,128
If someone is too intelligent
one might fall in love.

375
00:37:04,812 --> 00:37:07,280
But your Caspar is well-built too.

376
00:37:07,812 --> 00:37:10,201
Does he have anything in his pants?

377
00:37:10,452 --> 00:37:13,444
-You know, he isn't my--
-Do you think they ever talk...

378
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:16,763
...about anything else
besides our breast-size?

379
00:37:17,332 --> 00:37:20,642
It could be fun to discuss dick-size
in public.

380
00:37:22,852 --> 00:37:26,003
Caspar. We were just talking about you
and your friend.

381
00:37:26,332 --> 00:37:30,120
-Friend? What friend?
-Carrot or banana?

382
00:37:32,532 --> 00:37:36,445
Have you heard of a hospital in Heidelberg
with the abbreviation AAA?

383
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,925
-With an exclamation point?
-How did you know that?

384
00:37:42,172 --> 00:37:45,687
There's a medical association.
The Anti-Hippocrates Lodge.

385
00:37:46,812 --> 00:37:48,723
Where did you see it?

386
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:51,287
On a corpse. Like the sign left by a brand.

387
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:54,203
It must have been something else.

388
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:57,006
The Anti-Hippocrates Lodge
has been forbidden.

389
00:37:57,612 --> 00:37:59,603
It doesn't exist anymore.

390
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:12,567
It seems a bit kitsch here.

391
00:38:13,132 --> 00:38:17,808
I mean, a pond at sunset in Heidelberg,
the birds chirping....

392
00:38:22,372 --> 00:38:24,090
Kissing is in bad taste?

393
00:38:25,412 --> 00:38:27,243
You know what I mean.

394
00:38:28,452 --> 00:38:31,762
Is it possible that it's easier for you
to fool around with dead men...

395
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:33,888
...than with living men?

396
00:38:37,652 --> 00:38:40,485
-Is that true or am I right?
-You idiot.

397
00:38:40,572 --> 00:38:40,972
-And? ls he right?
-He's an insolent fool.

398
00:38:40,972 --> 00:38:43,850
-And? ls he right?
-He's an insolent fool.

399
00:38:45,132 --> 00:38:50,490
Anyway, AAA is the abbreviation for
Age Actabile Antihippocrate.

400
00:38:51,092 --> 00:38:52,320
Do that which is possible?

401
00:38:52,452 --> 00:38:55,444
There's nothing specific about
its being a secret organisation.

402
00:38:55,532 --> 00:38:58,569
It's a mixture between a Masonic lodge
and a student fraternity...

403
00:38:58,772 --> 00:39:00,888
...with rituals, lodge and so on.

404
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:05,604
The point is, contrary to doctors who
pledge themselves to Hippocratic ideals...

405
00:39:05,812 --> 00:39:07,803
...helping, healing and so on...

406
00:39:07,892 --> 00:39:11,089
...they are completely devoted
to scientific research. Here.

407
00:39:11,692 --> 00:39:16,971
"Experimental killing of individuals
to promote the survival of many." Insane.

408
00:39:17,212 --> 00:39:21,046
Here: "Founded in the 16th century. Last
peak in activity during the Third Reich.

409
00:39:21,132 --> 00:39:23,407
"At present there have been
isolated activities...

410
00:39:23,492 --> 00:39:26,245
"...in genetic research,
artificial insemination...

411
00:39:26,332 --> 00:39:27,447
"...and pharmacology.

412
00:39:27,572 --> 00:39:30,484
"An Anti-Hippocratic centre
at the beginning of the century...

413
00:39:30,572 --> 00:39:32,563
"...and during the Nazi period was...

414
00:39:32,932 --> 00:39:34,445
"...Heidelberg."

415
00:39:36,972 --> 00:39:39,964
-And David....
-An ideal victim for forbidden experiments.

416
00:39:40,052 --> 00:39:44,284
A young patient with a rare disease in its
advanced stages, model development....

417
00:39:44,932 --> 00:39:46,968
So you mean that here, in Heidelberg...

418
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,282
...doctors are engaging
in forbidden experiments?

419
00:39:51,092 --> 00:39:52,081
Of course.

420
00:39:53,412 --> 00:39:57,564
My diarrhoea. God, diarrhoea like that
must be Anti-Hippocratic.

421
00:39:57,692 --> 00:39:59,603
Paula, really. It itches.

422
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:02,610
I think I already have a brand on my butt.

423
00:40:03,572 --> 00:40:05,290
-What? Promidal?
-That's right.

424
00:40:06,212 --> 00:40:08,248
Promidal, exactly the way
you pronounce it.

425
00:40:08,332 --> 00:40:12,291
At first it was used by taxidermists.
It's basically plasma-proteic.

426
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:15,728
It practically plastimises tissue
by extracting all the salt.

427
00:40:16,412 --> 00:40:20,883
One injects it into a living animal and it is
carried by the bloodstream into the cells.

428
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:24,682
Put simply, once allowed to harden,
you have your specimen.

429
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:26,888
It was forbidden
by animal protection agencies.

430
00:40:26,972 --> 00:40:30,851
The longer it's active inside an animal,
the thicker the blood becomes.

431
00:40:30,932 --> 00:40:36,006
The animal's movements become slower
and sooner or later: bingo.

432
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:40,121
-Paula? Are you still there?
-Yeah.

433
00:40:40,452 --> 00:40:42,329
Its chemical structure is amazingly simple.

434
00:40:42,412 --> 00:40:44,972
The antidote is basically
a simple saline solution.

435
00:40:45,052 --> 00:40:48,249
The question is,
how did it get into your friend's blood?

436
00:40:48,732 --> 00:40:50,962
Yeah, me too. On your firm buttocks.

437
00:40:53,052 --> 00:40:54,644
-Paula?
-Yeah.

438
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:01,648
-You pervert!
-Are you still there?

439
00:41:11,292 --> 00:41:12,805
My father.

440
00:41:15,532 --> 00:41:18,524
No stupid remark on hand, right?

441
00:41:23,412 --> 00:41:25,209
Gretchen, guess what?

442
00:41:25,292 --> 00:41:27,283
Hi, Hein.

443
00:41:29,252 --> 00:41:30,526
Hi, Phil.

444
00:41:32,812 --> 00:41:34,882
We were studying anatomy.

445
00:41:36,732 --> 00:41:39,485
About David, I got the histological result.

446
00:41:40,012 --> 00:41:43,322
-The stuff is called Promidal.
-Paula is investigating a conspiracy.

447
00:41:43,412 --> 00:41:47,371
Doctors are tattooing notes
on their patients' asses.

448
00:41:48,612 --> 00:41:49,931
Anti-Hippocratic Lodge.

449
00:41:52,332 --> 00:41:55,244
I just need to find out what they tried
to test on David.

450
00:41:59,732 --> 00:42:02,200
I'm going back to the dissecting room.

451
00:42:03,412 --> 00:42:05,130
-Sorry to bother you.
-No problem.

452
00:42:05,212 --> 00:42:07,521
Anyway, Phil couldn't get it up.

453
00:42:09,852 --> 00:42:14,050
Philip? Hormones. Low blood pressure.
We are all doctors, aren't we?

454
00:42:15,372 --> 00:42:18,887
We want to go out for dinner
and try again afterwards. Will you join us?

455
00:42:18,972 --> 00:42:20,769
-I mean, for dinner.
-Well, no.

456
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:24,768
But thanks. And have fun. Good luck.
Bye.

457
00:42:31,972 --> 00:42:34,725
Professor. I'm glad you're still here.

458
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:39,245
Do you have any idea why someone would
inject a heart patient with Promidal?

459
00:42:39,332 --> 00:42:42,165
Promidal? That's absolutely impossible.

460
00:42:42,252 --> 00:42:45,847
-I'm not a heart specialist, but....
-The young man with heart disease....

461
00:42:46,372 --> 00:42:49,887
-I tested his blood....
-Didn't we close the case?

462
00:42:50,372 --> 00:42:53,967
Yes. Why? Do you wish
to prevent me from....

463
00:42:54,052 --> 00:42:56,771
Don't you have enough work
to do on your research project?

464
00:42:56,852 --> 00:43:00,049
Have you already gathered
all the histological results?

465
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:03,172
I was going to do that tomorrow,
before the lecture.

466
00:43:03,612 --> 00:43:08,811
By the way, could you briefly list
the differences between...

467
00:43:09,012 --> 00:43:13,005
...acute myelocytic
and acute lymphocytic leukaemia?

468
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:21,167
You accidentally cut yourself.

469
00:43:21,692 --> 00:43:23,489
The scalpels are sharp.

470
00:43:25,372 --> 00:43:28,205
-I think he likes me.
-I know that now.

471
00:43:28,732 --> 00:43:32,691
You're no good. You're arrogant
because you're so stupid.

472
00:43:32,772 --> 00:43:34,683
Cutting yourself like that....

473
00:43:38,612 --> 00:43:41,809
That feels good. The bandage.

474
00:43:42,612 --> 00:43:45,080
Yes. Women know how to apply bandages.

475
00:43:49,772 --> 00:43:53,287
You have a nice way of holding it
in your hand.

476
00:43:54,692 --> 00:43:58,162
Tell me, in general,
do you think it's kitsch here?

477
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:04,923
Are you still interested
in the Anti-Hippocratic Lodge?

478
00:44:05,212 --> 00:44:08,204
I'll drop by this evening
around 10:30 or 1 1 :00.

479
00:44:21,652 --> 00:44:23,051
Shall we go?

480
00:44:25,052 --> 00:44:27,850
And I say, "Don't cut the eye! "

481
00:44:28,572 --> 00:44:32,167
It was already black, because the corpse
had been there for so long.

482
00:44:33,092 --> 00:44:35,731
Anyway he says, "No, no. I know
what I'm doing."

483
00:44:36,532 --> 00:44:41,048
He already had brains all over his lab coat
because he had dropped them before.

484
00:46:01,812 --> 00:46:03,211
I've seen this before.

485
00:46:11,372 --> 00:46:14,409
"Up to the early 18th century
this was a warning to traitors.

486
00:46:14,812 --> 00:46:17,087
"The herald of punishment.

487
00:46:18,892 --> 00:46:22,965
"A scalpel slashed the left cheek
of the guilty party three times.

488
00:46:24,652 --> 00:46:27,849
"Three cuts opened throat,
chest and belly."

489
00:46:45,692 --> 00:46:48,126
-Watch out! I have a knife!
-What are you doing?

490
00:46:51,372 --> 00:46:53,283
What are you doing in my room?

491
00:46:53,372 --> 00:46:57,001
Is Gretchen here?
I wanted to talk to her, because....

492
00:46:58,812 --> 00:47:01,849
Did you see that shit over there?
Some asshole tried to....

493
00:47:01,932 --> 00:47:04,162
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

494
00:47:04,492 --> 00:47:06,687
It's just Gretchen. I think...

495
00:47:07,452 --> 00:47:10,569
-...she doesn't love me anymore.
-Come on.

496
00:47:10,892 --> 00:47:13,770
You have some problems
in your relationship.

497
00:47:15,052 --> 00:47:17,247
Gretchen feels really bad about it, too.

498
00:47:17,692 --> 00:47:20,843
Get out!
We don't want people like you here!

499
00:47:20,932 --> 00:47:22,524
Calm down, Grandpa!

500
00:47:22,972 --> 00:47:27,762
They even paid me
to leave The Four Seasons immediately.

501
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:31,882
-A free dinner would be fine, too.
-And my dessert?

502
00:47:39,692 --> 00:47:42,764
Wow! Sweetie! You're totally wild!

503
00:47:43,972 --> 00:47:46,805
But Gretchen will only let
really hard Hansels in.

504
00:47:47,812 --> 00:47:50,610
-What do you mean by that?
-Anatomy test.

505
00:48:53,772 --> 00:48:56,445
This morning I had a burst prostate gland
on the table.

506
00:49:00,052 --> 00:49:02,202
Did I do anything wrong?

507
00:49:04,252 --> 00:49:06,971
I'm sorry. Is it over?

508
00:49:11,332 --> 00:49:12,447
Too bad...

509
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,323
...that these things are so sensitive!

510
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:18,491
-When you cut them open they look simple.
-Gretchen!

511
00:49:20,412 --> 00:49:24,849
You know, women often don't take
the time to understand men.

512
00:49:26,612 --> 00:49:29,524
I mean, I'm not a great conversationalist.

513
00:49:29,652 --> 00:49:32,405
-You know what I mean.
-Yeah.

514
00:49:33,212 --> 00:49:36,170
But I'm still delicate and sensitive...

515
00:49:37,052 --> 00:49:40,169
...even if I give the impression
of being outwardly strong.

516
00:49:41,532 --> 00:49:44,330
-Are you already...? Shall l...?
-No, no.

517
00:49:46,652 --> 00:49:49,689
It's just that I'm very emotional
about Gretchen, because--

518
00:49:53,892 --> 00:49:56,167
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-No. Hein was about to....

519
00:49:57,612 --> 00:50:00,604
-No, no.
-No, you wanted....

520
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:05,450
I didn't mean to disturb you.
If you two have something important to....

521
00:50:05,532 --> 00:50:07,488
-Hein, you can stay.
-It's not so important.

522
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:10,689
-We could do it some other time. Bye.
-Well, no....

523
00:50:11,612 --> 00:50:15,366
Hey, wait a minute.
You wanted to tell me something about....

524
00:50:20,092 --> 00:50:25,928
-Yes, Hein. What's that?
-A corpse slashed back at me.

525
00:50:27,652 --> 00:50:30,291
-See you.
-Give my regards to Gretchen.

526
00:50:31,772 --> 00:50:33,569
I don't want to hurt her.

527
00:50:36,372 --> 00:50:37,122
Four?

528
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:42,441
Well, sweetie. You're my fifth failure.

529
00:50:44,092 --> 00:50:45,366
Though sex on the job is...

530
00:50:45,452 --> 00:50:47,249
...the most natural thing in the world.

531
00:50:48,492 --> 00:50:50,767
You're a nightmare for any tough guy.

532
00:50:54,732 --> 00:50:56,404
Poor, little Phil.

533
00:51:23,492 --> 00:51:27,121
You're a horrible men's club,
and I'm God's punishment.

534
00:51:31,532 --> 00:51:33,363
Are you finished again already?

535
00:51:39,812 --> 00:51:42,280
Gretchen? Such a beautiful body...

536
00:51:44,172 --> 00:51:46,925
...and such an ugly, little whore's soul.

537
00:51:59,172 --> 00:52:02,005
Do you have any idea
of how much you've hurt me?

538
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:03,691
I loved you.

539
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:09,244
-Do you think I have no feelings?
-What did you inject me with?

540
00:52:09,332 --> 00:52:12,768
-I can't stay with a whore anymore.
-What did you inject me with?

541
00:52:13,132 --> 00:52:16,886
No, it's not about us anymore.
You've ruined everything.

542
00:52:25,332 --> 00:52:27,288
I injected 15 mg.

543
00:52:28,532 --> 00:52:32,207
That's quite a lot. It should work quickly.

544
00:53:04,732 --> 00:53:08,247
Your blood. Do you remember?
"Like gum."

545
00:53:08,412 --> 00:53:10,403
Got you.

546
00:53:14,092 --> 00:53:18,131
I see, you want to go outside.
Wait, I'll help you.

547
00:53:20,172 --> 00:53:24,085
But I believe you can't make it.
Shall we bet on it?

548
00:53:24,612 --> 00:53:28,446
Hey, if you manage to cross the threshold,
I'll set you free. Okay?

549
00:53:30,132 --> 00:53:32,202
On your marks, get set, go!

550
00:53:36,612 --> 00:53:41,003
Yes! Just a few more centimetres.
Maybe she'll make it. But then....

551
00:53:44,932 --> 00:53:46,206
That's mean.

552
00:53:52,492 --> 00:53:54,562
What are you doing to me?

553
00:54:05,612 --> 00:54:09,924
You beautiful, beautiful body.
Don't be afraid.

554
00:54:13,932 --> 00:54:17,288
I will preserve you, forever.

555
00:55:37,812 --> 00:55:41,771
Every day the door is open.
Today it's my turn, and it's closed.

556
00:56:07,452 --> 00:56:10,205
It's always open. Only today it isn't.

557
00:56:33,612 --> 00:56:35,125
What the hell is going on?

558
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:38,044
Just some student's joke.

559
00:56:39,332 --> 00:56:42,927
Thank you, Mrs. Stöbel.
Fatma, you can clean up later.

560
00:56:45,212 --> 00:56:48,284
Yesterday I walked in
and found half an intestine under a table.

561
00:56:48,372 --> 00:56:49,964
Fuck. All those guts.

562
00:56:50,052 --> 00:56:54,330
Fucking students. You're lucky if you
don't run into one in a real operation.

563
00:56:55,732 --> 00:56:58,849
Could you say just one sentence
without using the word "fuck"?

564
00:56:59,492 --> 00:57:01,767
-After all, there are dead bodies here.
-Fuck.

565
00:57:05,852 --> 00:57:08,491
Okay darlings. Who will end up
under a scalpel today?

566
00:57:08,572 --> 00:57:10,369
-Please. Come on.
-Number five.

567
00:57:11,692 --> 00:57:13,364
-Sixteen.
-Sixteen.

568
00:57:16,012 --> 00:57:17,411
-Three.
-Yes.

569
00:57:17,572 --> 00:57:19,051
-And six.
-Six.

570
00:57:20,292 --> 00:57:23,762
-It won't open.
-The janitor should repair this shit.

571
00:57:24,332 --> 00:57:26,766
Come on, take the next one. There.

572
00:57:35,292 --> 00:57:38,409
What's this? They've cut his head off.

573
00:58:06,292 --> 00:58:08,328
The threats
by the Anti-Hippocratic Lodge...

574
00:58:08,452 --> 00:58:10,761
...prove that I'm on the right track.

575
00:58:11,332 --> 00:58:14,847
If it was blood you won't be able
to remove the stains from your sheets.

576
00:58:14,932 --> 00:58:17,605
It's better than brains. I ruined
a new cashmere sweater--

577
00:58:17,692 --> 00:58:19,489
Could one of you be serious?

578
00:58:19,892 --> 00:58:22,087
There's a criminal organisation
in Heidelberg.

579
00:58:22,172 --> 00:58:25,926
What's that supposed to mean?
Your blood will be next?

580
00:58:26,292 --> 00:58:29,250
Okay, all those rites and stuff are
a bit old fashioned.

581
00:58:29,332 --> 00:58:32,802
But the idea of unethical research
is not that outdated, is it?

582
00:58:32,892 --> 00:58:35,042
Blood in the bed, in a girl's room....

583
00:58:35,132 --> 00:58:38,090
It sounds more like one
of Phil's disgusting jokes to me.

584
00:58:38,172 --> 00:58:40,128
By the way, where is he?

585
00:58:40,292 --> 00:58:42,010
Have you seen Phil?

586
00:58:44,172 --> 00:58:45,571
I've seen a bit of him around.

587
00:58:47,492 --> 00:58:50,962
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen,
diverticulosis is...

588
00:58:51,052 --> 00:58:53,247
...a typical illness in the western world.

589
00:58:53,812 --> 00:58:59,887
As you can see....

590
00:59:31,612 --> 00:59:34,046
You may now depart for your weekend.

591
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:37,405
I need not remind you
of your upcoming exams.

592
00:59:37,932 --> 00:59:41,766
Be glad. Those who pass
will have more room to work and...

593
00:59:42,212 --> 00:59:43,850
...many more corpses.

594
01:00:03,972 --> 01:00:05,291
Hi, Paula.

595
01:00:08,252 --> 01:00:12,803
I wanted to thank you
for your time yesterday.

596
01:00:13,492 --> 01:00:16,928
You know it makes a person feel good
to see...

597
01:00:18,692 --> 01:00:20,762
...someone show concern.

598
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,408
I solved my problem with Gretchen, too.

599
01:00:24,812 --> 01:00:27,042
Really? I thought
she was away for the weekend.

600
01:00:27,132 --> 01:00:29,521
-Look, I brought you something.
-You shouldn't have.

601
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:32,129
Cardiomyopathy - AAA! - No storage

602
01:00:36,252 --> 01:00:39,642
From Gretchen. And Paula,
you really should stop all this nonsense...

603
01:00:39,732 --> 01:00:41,529
...about David.

604
01:00:41,932 --> 01:00:44,207
You're getting in the way of our research.

605
01:00:45,212 --> 01:00:47,521
David's body wasn't worth
anything anymore.

606
01:00:47,612 --> 01:00:49,409
He was doomed. It was obvious.

607
01:00:50,212 --> 01:00:52,521
Paula. I really like you, but--

608
01:00:55,252 --> 01:00:59,564
Is this some stupid joke?
Hein, you psychopathic asshole!

609
01:00:59,772 --> 01:01:03,003
Don't yell like that. We're not alone.

610
01:01:07,972 --> 01:01:09,451
Gretchen (cell phone) - 0172/555 22 97

611
01:01:11,692 --> 01:01:14,968
The person you have called is
temporarily not available.

612
01:01:22,252 --> 01:01:25,005
-This means there is no corpse.
-Not anymore. But....

613
01:01:25,092 --> 01:01:27,811
You don't know this mysterious David's
last name...

614
01:01:27,932 --> 01:01:30,162
...or where he lives. Which state
is he from?

615
01:01:31,492 --> 01:01:33,881
Well at least we know his brand.

616
01:01:34,332 --> 01:01:37,210
This secret organisation.
This Anti-Coppo...

617
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:40,769
-Anti-Hippocratic Lodge.
-...Copocrats.

618
01:01:40,852 --> 01:01:42,843
But, don't you understand?

619
01:01:43,532 --> 01:01:45,682
What about Gretchen?
Margarete Möllmann.

620
01:01:45,772 --> 01:01:47,490
-It's been days since--
-Listen, miss.

621
01:01:47,572 --> 01:01:51,247
A female student hasn't slept in her bed
for one night. So?

622
01:01:51,892 --> 01:01:54,281
-A medical student.
-A chopped off finger?

623
01:01:55,572 --> 01:01:59,360
Do you remember last year when
those two girls reported...

624
01:01:59,612 --> 01:02:03,048
...that a headless corpse was waving
its hands in the dissecting room?

625
01:02:04,332 --> 01:02:06,004
Yeah, high-voltage cable.

626
01:02:06,812 --> 01:02:09,451
Hi, Paula. Still pursuing conspirators?

627
01:02:27,372 --> 01:02:31,570
Caspar? Oh, Frank. Is....
Have you seen Gretchen?

628
01:02:33,012 --> 01:02:36,482
Yes. She might be....

629
01:02:37,572 --> 01:02:38,766
Hello? Paula....

630
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,764
Dear Gretchen! I need to talk to you!

631
01:02:40,972 --> 01:02:41,848
Regards, Paula

632
01:02:43,732 --> 01:02:46,292
You must come. Forget the others.
This is our project.

633
01:02:46,732 --> 01:02:47,721
Okay, see you.

634
01:02:49,052 --> 01:02:52,089
-Have you seen Gretchen?
-I heard voices in the dissecting room.

635
01:02:56,972 --> 01:02:58,200
Gretchen?

636
01:02:59,852 --> 01:03:01,046
Shit.

637
01:03:09,532 --> 01:03:11,602
Gretchen is on table three.

638
01:03:12,572 --> 01:03:14,051
Or perhaps four?

639
01:03:14,412 --> 01:03:17,051
Quit cracking idiotic jokes,
you psychopath.

640
01:03:18,652 --> 01:03:21,769
-Where is Gretchen?
-Well, take a look. Come on.

641
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:23,485
You're usually so curious.

642
01:03:23,572 --> 01:03:25,290
-You're completely--
-You whore...

643
01:03:25,372 --> 01:03:27,203
...look for your whore friend!

644
01:03:30,132 --> 01:03:32,726
Are you afraid of corpses?
Table three or table four?

645
01:03:33,572 --> 01:03:35,051
Three or four?

646
01:03:35,972 --> 01:03:37,325
Maybe she's still alive.

647
01:03:40,052 --> 01:03:41,724
Maybe now she isn't anymore.

648
01:03:44,772 --> 01:03:45,761
Jokes.

649
01:03:47,052 --> 01:03:50,089
It's just fun. Stupid students' jokes.

650
01:03:50,212 --> 01:03:54,091
Dead bodies. Old, dead, disgusting flesh.

651
01:03:55,092 --> 01:03:57,526
Jokes, they're all jokes, Paula.

652
01:04:17,492 --> 01:04:19,801
Are you afraid of me now?

653
01:04:29,132 --> 01:04:30,485
Paula!

654
01:04:37,372 --> 01:04:38,725
Wait up.

655
01:04:41,532 --> 01:04:43,329
Paula. Wait a minute. Don't be afraid.

656
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:49,322
It was just for fun, nothing more.

657
01:04:51,492 --> 01:04:54,370
Come on, Paula.
There's no need to be afraid of me.

658
01:04:54,572 --> 01:04:55,687
I was just joking.

659
01:04:56,052 --> 01:04:57,770
Paula, wait.

660
01:05:04,652 --> 01:05:05,562
MORGUE

661
01:05:51,892 --> 01:05:53,325
Is anyone here?

662
01:06:38,332 --> 01:06:41,369
-What are you doing here?
-Don't be afraid. You're safe here.

663
01:06:41,972 --> 01:06:45,760
-The Lodge is off-limits.
-The Anti-Hippocratic Lodge.

664
01:06:46,692 --> 01:06:49,252
-You too?
-Yes, of course.

665
01:06:49,732 --> 01:06:52,929
Anti-Hippocratic simply means
the desire to work as a scientist...

666
01:06:53,132 --> 01:06:57,967
...mostly in an unspectacular way,
but without petty bourgeois limitations.

667
01:06:58,972 --> 01:07:02,487
-There are psychos with scalpels outside.
-Just big-mouthed louts...

668
01:07:02,572 --> 01:07:03,721
...who enjoy frightening girls.

669
01:07:05,012 --> 01:07:07,731
Do you think it's possible
to make progress in research...

670
01:07:07,812 --> 01:07:10,280
...while adhering to ethical principles?

671
01:07:10,372 --> 01:07:12,328
Heidelberg has a reputation to maintain.

672
01:07:12,492 --> 01:07:15,325
Do you know
when we won the last Nobel prize?

673
01:07:15,412 --> 01:07:17,801
Medical research is highly competitive...

674
01:07:17,892 --> 01:07:21,487
...funds for research, commissions
from the pharmaceutical industry...

675
01:07:21,572 --> 01:07:24,723
...it's all about financing the education
of an elite.

676
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:27,641
Your little series of experiments....

677
01:07:27,732 --> 01:07:30,929
Where do you think
those tissue samples come from?

678
01:07:31,012 --> 01:07:33,162
Well, I was just asking myself--

679
01:07:33,252 --> 01:07:36,528
Just ask a so-called ethical board
for their opinion...

680
01:07:37,092 --> 01:07:41,051
...on testing leukaemia patients
without their knowledge.

681
01:07:41,212 --> 01:07:43,521
-I had no idea.
-Of course not.

682
01:07:44,372 --> 01:07:47,364
And who cares?
A terminally ill patient barely notices.

683
01:07:49,052 --> 01:07:52,601
Everyone wants to be cured,
but no one wants to pay the price.

684
01:07:52,692 --> 01:07:55,490
But, the crimes committed
by the Anti-Hippocratic Lodge....

685
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:59,963
My God. The embarrassing slips
made by a few Nazi doctors...

686
01:08:00,892 --> 01:08:04,487
...of course these must be rejected.
But the achievements of those times...

687
01:08:04,692 --> 01:08:07,525
...have been lost. Especially in anatomy.

688
01:08:07,612 --> 01:08:10,888
When your grandfather developed
Promidal--

689
01:08:10,972 --> 01:08:12,769
-What?
-Well, of course.

690
01:08:13,052 --> 01:08:15,850
Grand Master of The Lodge
up to the end of the war.

691
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:18,083
I thought you knew that.

692
01:08:18,492 --> 01:08:20,210
-But--
-Your grandfather.

693
01:08:20,292 --> 01:08:23,489
They were just terminally ill prisoners,
worthless lives.

694
01:08:23,652 --> 01:08:27,531
But those fantastic specimens! Vivisected!

695
01:08:48,932 --> 01:08:50,365
Honey! You've already arrived!

696
01:08:50,572 --> 01:08:52,483
-Did they give you the message?
-What about?

697
01:08:52,572 --> 01:08:54,881
-Your grandfather....
-What's wrong?

698
01:09:00,332 --> 01:09:01,560
But I wanted....

699
01:09:06,012 --> 01:09:07,764
He's so disgusting.

700
01:09:17,812 --> 01:09:21,805
Paula, we can break a body down
into molecules and examine it.

701
01:09:23,252 --> 01:09:26,369
But we can't grasp the soul's
basic essence.

702
01:09:30,932 --> 01:09:32,206
Is it all true?

703
01:09:34,732 --> 01:09:38,930
You hate him and you love him
at the same time. I know that feeling well.

704
01:09:39,212 --> 01:09:40,930
I've known it for about 50 years.

705
01:09:45,212 --> 01:09:46,281
Quiet please!

706
01:09:49,812 --> 01:09:52,884
The human specimens which were
preserved were all morituri.

707
01:09:52,972 --> 01:09:55,884
Two carcinomas, one leukaemia,
one advanced myocarditis.

708
01:09:56,012 --> 01:09:59,766
I confess to having broken the rules
in the two aforementioned cases.

709
01:09:59,972 --> 01:10:04,204
Enough! You have murdered
human beings! Fellow students!

710
01:10:05,012 --> 01:10:08,129
-This is beyond--
-I have broken the rules...

711
01:10:08,212 --> 01:10:11,090
...set down in the book
and accept the penalty.

712
01:10:11,292 --> 01:10:16,412
Young man, the Lodge provides
a traditional form for our research--

713
01:10:16,892 --> 01:10:20,805
For hypocritical chatter about
forbidden pharmaceutical experimentation?

714
01:10:20,892 --> 01:10:23,167
To get money
from the pharmaceutical industry.

715
01:10:23,252 --> 01:10:27,689
The Lodge has always disregarded laws
and prevailing morals, on a grand scale.

716
01:10:28,092 --> 01:10:31,209
You are destroying everything
with your petty bourgeois morals!

717
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:36,410
I know the rules.

718
01:10:39,132 --> 01:10:40,963
What we are doing is pure research.

719
01:10:41,052 --> 01:10:42,804
Not your fucking, bourgeois medicine.

720
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:45,811
What do I care about the aches
and pains of a pensioner...

721
01:10:45,892 --> 01:10:47,803
...who'll kick the bucket
two years from now?

722
01:10:48,332 --> 01:10:51,483
Take a look at our specimens.
That is science!

723
01:10:51,812 --> 01:10:54,042
That is for eternity!

724
01:10:55,212 --> 01:10:58,887
As his professor and Grand Master,
I take full responsibility.

725
01:10:59,652 --> 01:11:03,247
A murder committed out of jealousy
is no internal matter for the Lodge.

726
01:11:03,532 --> 01:11:05,921
I will pass this case on to the police...

727
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:08,810
...with all its consequences,
even those which involve me.

728
01:11:09,332 --> 01:11:12,847
You won't do that. Did you hear me?
You won't do that!

729
01:11:16,292 --> 01:11:17,725
You'll regret it.

730
01:11:17,852 --> 01:11:20,207
This is the Hennings' answering machine.

731
01:11:20,332 --> 01:11:23,768
We're momentarily not at home.
Please leave us a message.

732
01:11:23,892 --> 01:11:25,723
We will call you back.

733
01:11:27,132 --> 01:11:31,125
This is Grombek.
A message for Miss Paula Henning.

734
01:11:32,132 --> 01:11:38,287
Please call me back. It's urgent.
Heidelberg, 23 17 96.

735
01:11:39,452 --> 01:11:41,966
Or preferably,
drop by tomorrow morning to see me.

736
01:11:42,052 --> 01:11:46,921
We have a far larger problem...

737
01:11:47,012 --> 01:11:49,890
...than I feared.

738
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,770
It seems it will be necessary
to inform the police.

739
01:11:53,532 --> 01:11:56,171
I think, I will need your help.

740
01:12:46,652 --> 01:12:50,167
I know I'm not a great doctor.
I don't have your talent.

741
01:12:50,772 --> 01:12:54,048
I could never prove
that there are also other ways.

742
01:12:54,932 --> 01:12:58,971
But you are strong, Paula.
You have a heart.

743
01:13:01,212 --> 01:13:03,646
You can do everything differently.

744
01:13:16,612 --> 01:13:20,287
Meet me today at 8.00 p.m.
in the specimen hall. Grombek.

745
01:13:21,252 --> 01:13:22,605
Only at 8.00 p.m.?

746
01:13:22,692 --> 01:13:24,205
Caspar is up in our room.

747
01:13:24,772 --> 01:13:27,240
The others are studying
for the mid-term exam.

748
01:13:27,332 --> 01:13:29,846
-Have you by any chance seen Gretchen?
-No.

749
01:13:44,772 --> 01:13:47,161
-Paula, what's wrong?
-Hi.

750
01:13:48,412 --> 01:13:51,370
Gretchen hasn't shown up yet
and my grandpa....

751
01:13:51,612 --> 01:13:52,840
Come in.

752
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:58,966
I thought she was away
for the weekend with Phil?

753
01:13:59,052 --> 01:14:00,849
Yes, but it's just....

754
01:16:44,052 --> 01:16:45,644
What I wanted to say was....

755
01:17:15,612 --> 01:17:16,931
Professor?

756
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:25,290
Professor Grombek?

757
01:17:34,092 --> 01:17:35,241
Hello?

758
01:18:08,332 --> 01:18:10,641
My most beautiful work.

759
01:18:11,492 --> 01:18:13,562
Because I really loved her.

760
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:22,206
Isn't the human body a miracle?

761
01:18:22,692 --> 01:18:26,321
So cleverly constructed.
An incredibly intelligent system...

762
01:18:27,452 --> 01:18:29,568
...of such breathtaking beauty.

763
01:18:31,292 --> 01:18:34,682
That's why I became a doctor.
Wasn't that why you did?

764
01:18:34,932 --> 01:18:38,845
These vivid colours. And the tissue....
So rich.

765
01:18:40,332 --> 01:18:43,483
It's like capturing life for a moment.

766
01:18:44,972 --> 01:18:50,569
Promidal has nothing to do with
preserving decomposing flesh.

767
01:18:52,372 --> 01:18:55,728
Look, I cheated here.
The carotid belongs to someone else.

768
01:18:56,212 --> 01:18:59,727
Gretchen's was twisted
in such a strange way that....

769
01:19:00,452 --> 01:19:01,726
But look here.

770
01:19:03,372 --> 01:19:05,488
Her heart. Fantastic.

771
01:19:08,572 --> 01:19:09,925
The face...

772
01:19:11,212 --> 01:19:12,930
...is just for me.

773
01:19:14,692 --> 01:19:16,967
I can put it on her, when I'm alone--

774
01:19:20,612 --> 01:19:21,806
You don't understand?

775
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:24,810
Most people don't understand.

776
01:19:24,892 --> 01:19:27,452
Gretchen will be beautiful for me. Forever.

777
01:19:27,532 --> 01:19:29,841
And you will be beautiful, too.

778
01:20:08,052 --> 01:20:10,088
-Caspar?
-That wasn't nice of you.

779
01:20:19,052 --> 01:20:22,806
I was looking for you,
because I wanted to explain...

780
01:20:24,732 --> 01:20:28,486
...and then this crazy guy
headed for you with a syringe.

781
01:20:28,892 --> 01:20:31,531
-Did he give me a shot?
-A huge one!

782
01:20:32,732 --> 01:20:36,122
Quick, Caspar.
A hypertonic saline solution.

783
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:40,166
-10% sodium chloride in--
-This isn't appropriate timing, but...

784
01:20:41,212 --> 01:20:43,168
-...l'm not a doctor.
-What?

785
01:20:43,372 --> 01:20:47,888
History. I'm writing a thesis
on the Anti-Hippocratic Lodge...

786
01:20:48,212 --> 01:20:51,602
-...from their origins up to 1945.
-A syringe!

787
01:20:51,692 --> 01:20:54,650
There, behind the door.
In the middle cabinet. Hurry!

788
01:20:56,012 --> 01:20:58,526
I just wanted to go down to the library...

789
01:20:58,852 --> 01:21:01,525
...since they normally won't let anyone in.

790
01:21:01,652 --> 01:21:03,449
Take the small bottle of sodium chloride.

791
01:21:03,972 --> 01:21:09,922
-What?
-'N', 'a', 'C', 'l'.

792
01:21:12,292 --> 01:21:15,284
Here. They would have found out
after mid-term exams.

793
01:21:15,692 --> 01:21:19,128
But I have nearly everything I need.
Tell me...

794
01:21:19,612 --> 01:21:22,410
-...do you think something dangerous....
-Caspar.

795
01:21:23,132 --> 01:21:26,681
-My real name is Oliver Kaufmann.
-Great.

796
01:21:27,532 --> 01:21:29,568
-Prepare the syringe.
-Okay.

797
01:21:38,412 --> 01:21:40,482
-Turn it over.
-Like this?

798
01:21:40,652 --> 01:21:42,882
Oh, like on TV.

799
01:21:45,692 --> 01:21:47,330
Now in the air?

800
01:21:50,692 --> 01:21:55,641
-And now in the butt.
-No! ln the vein. Like on TV.

801
01:21:57,772 --> 01:21:59,763
-No. I can't do it.
-Caspar!

802
01:21:59,892 --> 01:22:03,521
I need the saline solution.
Otherwise I'll die. Come on!

803
01:22:05,052 --> 01:22:07,247
At a low angle into the vein.

804
01:22:19,052 --> 01:22:22,408
That wasn't at all bad for a historian.

805
01:22:29,572 --> 01:22:32,211
Wouldn't it be safer to call the hospital?

806
01:22:34,892 --> 01:22:38,043
Tell me, why did you have Promidal
in the bathroom cabinet?

807
01:22:38,132 --> 01:22:40,123
-Promi.... What?
-Promidal.

808
01:22:42,612 --> 01:22:45,285
The stuff they killed those people with.

809
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:03,282
That's our bathroom.

810
01:23:05,172 --> 01:23:06,844
The deodorant is mine, too.

811
01:23:07,652 --> 01:23:09,847
What is the meaning of this?

812
01:23:10,612 --> 01:23:16,005
Hey, guys. I'm not a doctor.
This interests me only as a historian.

813
01:23:17,332 --> 01:23:20,927
Take a look. These drawings are
by Paula's grandpa.

814
01:23:21,052 --> 01:23:23,282
The act of procreation in cross section.

815
01:23:23,372 --> 01:23:25,727
An eternal hard-on, one could say.

816
01:23:25,812 --> 01:23:28,246
Or, if you prefer, half a hard-on.

817
01:23:38,492 --> 01:23:40,881
Hein has injected you with 3 units.

818
01:23:42,132 --> 01:23:44,123
So you will be with us
for about four hours.

819
01:23:44,612 --> 01:23:48,924
If you keep your heart rate slow.
After all, it contains an analgesic.

820
01:23:50,292 --> 01:23:52,522
As student of medicine I find it somehow...

821
01:23:52,612 --> 01:23:54,250
...interesting.

822
01:23:56,452 --> 01:23:57,680
You can watch how....

823
01:23:59,612 --> 01:24:01,728
Would you like a cookie?

824
01:24:02,092 --> 01:24:04,890
When you're stoned while doing it, it's....

825
01:24:07,412 --> 01:24:10,051
Well? Did you sleep with
the little whore, too?

826
01:24:10,172 --> 01:24:15,041
Who? Gretchen? Leave that alone.
Don't play around with it.

827
01:24:16,692 --> 01:24:20,810
You're not in a position
to crack stupid jokes just now, Caspar.

828
01:24:21,452 --> 01:24:25,843
-Are you insane? You impotent asshole!
-Keep your mouth shut...

829
01:24:25,932 --> 01:24:28,685
...or I'll cut your vocal cords.

830
01:24:29,172 --> 01:24:31,208
I'm going to kill this arrogant bastard.

831
01:24:31,332 --> 01:24:35,291
-This can't be true.
-Keep your mouth shut, damn it!

832
01:24:36,212 --> 01:24:38,442
Shut up, that won't help--

833
01:24:43,612 --> 01:24:46,331
-What's happening here?
-I need saline solution.

834
01:25:32,132 --> 01:25:36,444
NaCl, you asshole! 'N', 'a'.

835
01:25:37,012 --> 01:25:38,843
Could someone stitch me up?

836
01:25:40,212 --> 01:25:42,248
Fucking medical assholes.

837
01:26:47,612 --> 01:26:51,287
"There's blood within the shoe."

838
01:29:29,932 --> 01:29:32,241
It was all just a joke! You pig!

839
01:29:45,772 --> 01:29:48,081
Hi. So?

840
01:29:52,012 --> 01:29:53,889
What is it?

841
01:29:55,492 --> 01:29:58,689
Everything's still there.
Don't complain so much, Caspar.

842
01:29:58,772 --> 01:30:01,366
Who knows, what permanent damage--

843
01:30:02,732 --> 01:30:04,290
Besides, my name is Oliver.

844
01:30:09,692 --> 01:30:14,083
This is just a check-up.
I soothe your pain. I'm a doctor.

845
01:30:17,532 --> 01:30:19,568
But your not practising.

846
01:30:24,892 --> 01:30:26,120
This is in bad taste.

847
01:30:55,492 --> 01:30:59,326
My God, it's terrible when one thinks
about it.

848
01:31:00,732 --> 01:31:02,450
Ludwig was always a bit weird.

849
01:31:02,732 --> 01:31:03,721
But Hein....

850
01:31:06,332 --> 01:31:07,890
Hein was actually....

851
01:31:11,332 --> 01:31:14,130
In scientific terms, he was brilliant.

852
01:31:15,892 --> 01:31:18,531
Sure, in scientific terms....

853
01:31:21,372 --> 01:31:23,647
Have you seen the specimens?

854
01:31:24,772 --> 01:31:27,081
I mean Gretchen.

855
01:31:27,532 --> 01:31:29,045
Before the police....

856
01:31:30,332 --> 01:31:32,448
Yes, in scientific terms, he was brilliant.

857
01:31:34,852 --> 01:31:37,286
In private life he was also absolutely okay.

858
01:31:38,972 --> 01:31:42,601
-Evenings at the Lodge....
-Pity about the Lodge.

859
01:31:42,852 --> 01:31:46,527
I'm going to a hospital in Berlin.
They say there's a good Lodge there.

860
01:31:46,612 --> 01:31:49,649
Isn't that where they experiment
anaesthetics on patients?

861
01:31:50,412 --> 01:31:51,322
And you?

862
01:31:51,572 --> 01:31:53,528
I'm taking over my father's studio.

863
01:31:54,732 --> 01:31:57,610
Private studios are rarely inspected...

864
01:31:58,132 --> 01:31:59,690
...so you can play around a little.

865
01:32:03,572 --> 01:32:07,247
Do you already know
who's going to be Grombek's successor?

866
01:32:07,532 --> 01:32:11,002
-Stievers, I believe.
-Is he also....

867
01:32:13,932 --> 01:32:15,365
Tradition.

868
01:32:16,172 --> 01:32:18,732
-Good morning.
-'Morning, Mr. Taxidermist. How are you?

869
01:32:20,092 --> 01:32:20,968
Same as always.

870
01:32:22,212 --> 01:32:25,204
