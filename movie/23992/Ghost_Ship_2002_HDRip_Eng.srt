1
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,837
I can't hold her much longer.
She's taking on too much water.

2
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,342
- What is going on back there?
- Keep your pants on, Murphy.

3
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,683
We blew the starboard engine.
Port engine's way too hot.

4
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,895
MUNDER: Hold on.
- Shorten the tow or cut her loose.

5
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,104
Epps...

6
00:05:56,272 --> 00:06:00,150
...get off my damn tugboat.
We don't have much time.

7
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,529
MURPHY: Move it, Epps. If she sinks,
she's taking us with her.

8
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,789
Got a punch in the port floater.

9
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,917
EPPS: Five minutes before she floods.
- Less than that!

10
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,669
Get back here.
We're cutting her loose.

11
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,381
- Cut her loose.
- That's it. Get back here.

12
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,383
Come on! You heard the man!

13
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:29,388
Took us three months to get her off
the bottom. I will not lose her now!

14
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,683
Goddamn it, Epps!
You can't fix everything!

15
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,268
Christ!

16
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:45,570
- For the last time, get back here!
- She's taking on too much water!

17
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,536
Why do you always have to break
my balls? I said get back here!

18
00:06:55,957 --> 00:07:01,253
MURPHY: Do you want me to come down
there and kick your ass? I'll do it.

19
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:11,263
MURPHY: Here's to the best damn
salvage crew in the business!

20
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,975
MUNDER: We did it, guys!
SANTOS: Yeah, look at that!

21
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,936
MUNDER:
All right. Nice work.

22
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,942
- Here's to the fucking sea!
- To the sea.

23
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,322
MURPHY:
To a job well done.

24
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:34,453
Mr. Murphy? I'm Jack Ferriman. I was
wondering if I could buy you a drink.

25
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,872
He doesn't drink.

26
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,295
Could I talk to you alone?

27
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,632
You talk to me, you talk to my crew.
That's the way it is.

28
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:54,014
I fly the Arctic Weather Patrol flights
out of Mackenzie Bay.

29
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:59,019
Last month I was out in the middle
of the Strait when I came across this.

30
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,981
Congratulations. You found a boat.

31
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,359
In the middle of the ocean,
of all places.

32
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:10,280
I tried for radio contact
and got nothing...

33
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,492
...so I figured she had to be adrift.

34
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,202
MURPHY:
In the Bering Strait?

35
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,830
That's miles from shipping lanes.
Did you alert the Coast Guard?

36
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:23,001
It's international waters,
so they noted it and that's it.

37
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,669
You get a name?

38
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:29,257
No, I put it out of my head until
two days ago when I saw it again.

39
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,802
MURPHY: What are we talking about?
What kind of tonnage?

40
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:37,140
Big. Huge.
Could be military.

41
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:41,019
Let's say that we're
a little bit interested.

42
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,146
MURPHY:
What's in it for you?

43
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,192
I want 20% finder's fee,
whatever she's won'th.

44
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:52,030
- Have you told anyone else about this?
- Not a living soul.

45
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:58,245
MURPHY: Give us a minute, will you?
JACK: Okay.

46
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,040
DODGE:
So? What do you think, Murph?

47
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,709
Who knows? Could be full of shit.

48
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:09,881
I do know one thing. I've seen strange
things happen in the Strait.

49
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:14,177
I know something else:
Sea gives you an opportunity, take it.

50
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:19,391
That's at least a week out of our way.
We've been out for six months already.

51
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,937
I got a fiancée waiting, remember?
I'm getting married in a month.

52
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:28,316
Plan was to go back to Anchorage.
Starboard diesel needs an overhaul.

53
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:32,904
- In our business, the only plan is:
GROUP: There is no plan.

54
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:38,201
If you don't want to go, that's fine.
Let's tell him we'll get somebody else.

55
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:44,082
Wait a minute. Let's not be hasty.
What's a ship like that won'th?

56
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,917
Who knows?

57
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:50,714
Millions? Thousands? Could be nothing.
Depends on a lot of things.

58
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,759
- Mainly, if we have the right to salvage.
- Pretty big "if."

59
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,722
- What's the split?
- We split it even, six ways.

60
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,434
- Even split?
MURPHY: Beats me paying you overtime.

61
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,394
I'm good.

62
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,230
DODGE:
I'm in.

63
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,735
EPPS:
Greer? What do you say?

64
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,486
All right.

65
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,743
MURPHY:
Hey, Ferriman! Can you come over here?

66
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:26,625
So this is the way it works.
10% instead of your 20% finder's fee.

67
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,591
I can't let you take advantage of me
like that.

68
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,552
That's the way it is.
Take it or leave it.

69
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,436
Fine. But I go with you.

70
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,023
Not on my boat, you don't.

71
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:54,694
Think I'd tell you where a fortune
might be without insurance?

72
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,989
There are five other boats
that would jump at this.

73
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,493
I come with you.
So you take it or leave it.

74
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,026
Ow! Those things are dull!

75
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,533
She'll love it. What do you think?

76
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:46,538
Too much off the sides, but I can
come up with something she'll love.

77
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,874
- Shave that yourself.
GREER: Don't want to help me out?

78
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:55,171
Who the fuck are you kidding? Everybody
knows you Navy boys take it up the ass.

79
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,694
- Enjoying the ride, Jack?
- No, sir.

80
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,253
Not the same as flying planes
over ice sheets, is it?

81
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,757
- What's the appeal?
JACK: I could ask you the same thing.

82
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:43,553
What's a nice girl doing in a dump
like this instead of raising a family?

83
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,432
I own a third of Murphy's operation.
I'm not that nice.

84
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,059
And these monkeys are my family.

85
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,314
SANTOS
Santos to Murphy. Come in.

86
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,445
- Yeah?
- I think you should get up here.

87
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,073
- What is it?
SANTOS: I think you should see this!

88
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,288
It was there a second ago!
Ten miles to the northwest.

89
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,458
Would you turn off that fucking music?

90
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,921
I'm telling you, there must be a glitch.
I saw it with my own eyes.

91
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,841
- Glitch, my ass. There's nothing there.
- Give me a look at this.

92
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:28,264
There it is! Right in front of you!
Tell me you don't see nothing.

93
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:33,728
SANTOS: Do you see what I'm saying?
Do you see what I'm saying to you?

94
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,984
- Dodge, could you get on the bow light?
DODGE: All right, Murph.

95
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,826
- It's there, right?
- There's something there.

96
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,961
EPPS:
Hey, Murph, what's up?

97
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,341
MURPHY:
Vessel at position 7-5 north...

98
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,718
...this is Arctic Warrior.

99
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,013
MURPHY:
Come in.

100
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:14,185
This is tugboat Arctic Warrior.
Do you read me?

101
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,564
This is Arctic Warrior.

102
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,024
Do you read me? Come in.

103
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,921
Shit!

104
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,243
SANTOS: Now do you believe me?
- Holy shit!

105
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,706
DODGE: An ocean liner?
Where did that come from?

106
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:28,092
It's the Antonia Graza.

107
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,803
Jesus Christ.

108
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:36,017
MURPHY: This is civilian tugboat Arctic
Warrior. Is there anyone aboard?

109
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,938
This is civilian tugboat ArcticWarrior.
Is there anyone aboard?

110
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:44,108
This is Arctic Warrior.
Can you read us?

111
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,823
- You know her, Murphy?
- Only in my dreams.

112
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,708
MURPHY:
Christ, she's beautiful.

113
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:07,840
Italian liners couldn't compete for speed,
so they built floating art palaces instead.

114
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:13,304
She was reported missing May 21,
1962, off the coast of Labrador.

115
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:18,601
Funny thing is, there was no distress
signal. She just disappeared.

116
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:24,774
Ever since, every captairs been looking
for her, hoping she hasn't gone down.

117
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,570
- Do you know what this means?
- What?

118
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:34,867
Under the law of the sea, she's ours.
Let's not keep a lady waiting.

119
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:39,664
MURPHY: Santos, bring us alongside.
Fire up the crane. We got business to do.

120
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:46,045
When we get onboard, stay together. We
don't know what kind of shape she's in.

121
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,340
MURPHY: Take us up, Greer.
GREER Aye, captain.

122
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:55,013
Hey, Murphy, please remember to keep
all channels open. Thank you.

123
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,185
They won't let me go.

124
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:05,440
Safety first.
That's why you go last, Jack.

125
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,568
Can you sit down?
I'm trying to keep this steady.

126
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,904
- I just want...
- Sit down! Get out of the way!

127
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,364
Okay.

128
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:20,705
She's had some battering over
the last 40 years, you can tell.

129
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,207
GREER:
Stand by. Setting you down topside.

130
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,087
She's still a beaut.

131
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,257
Unbelievable.

132
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,927
MURPHY:
You better stay alert. Watch your step.

133
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:38,473
40 years of rust can turn
deck plates into quicksand.

134
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,561
We'll make our way in at the fore,
then check the bridge. This way. Careful.

135
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:47,899
EPPS: Forward mast is history.
- Epps and Murphy, are they a couple?

136
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,946
Hell, no. She's like a daughter to him.
He'd be lost without her.

137
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,242
MUNDER: Superstructure's in decent
shape. No sign of damage.

138
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,829
EPPS:
Lifeboats are gone, stern to bow.

139
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,749
MUNDER:
Life preserver lockers are empty.

140
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,419
DODGE: Sure no survivors ever
turned up, Murph?

141
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,839
MURPHY: Sure as we're walking on
the Graza, Dodge. This way.

142
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,063
Let's go.

143
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:40,243
Jesus. She's no fiddler's green.

144
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,496
MURPHY:
You're wrong, Munder. She's beautiful.

145
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:47,250
Whoever was on here originally
sure left in a hurry.

146
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,587
Murphy, come in.

147
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,013
MUNDER:
Whoa.

148
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,314
EPPS: Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome aboard. I'm Julie.

149
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,358
I'll be your hostess this evening.

150
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,572
Shh!

151
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,490
Have some respect, okay?

152
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,993
Shh!

153
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,877
MUNDER:
Check out all those champagne bottles.

154
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,838
DODGE: Looks like we missed
one hell of a party.

155
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,632
EPPS: And one hell of a hangover.
MURPHY: Shut up!

156
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,622
- Shut up!
MURPHY: Let's find the bridge.

157
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:11,000
EPPS: Such a manly man.
MUNDER: What?

158
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,461
DODGE: You all right?
MUNDER: Shut up!

159
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,214
DODGE:
Come on, Mary, let's go.

160
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,722
EPPS: Murph, how many passengers
did she carry?

161
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,560
MURPHY: Over 600. The creme de la
creme of society from all over Europe.

162
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,562
Crew of 500 from Italy.

163
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,357
Talk to me. How's everything going?

164
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:45,201
MURPHY: Good. This companionway
should get us to the bridge.

165
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,120
Here, Epps, hold this.

166
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,641
What's going on?

167
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,311
- After you.
- No, after you.

168
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,564
No, no. After me.

169
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,608
DODGE:
Tough guy.

170
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,292
Don't let go!

171
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,129
- Pull! Pull!
- Please, Epps!

172
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,676
Please, Epps, don't let go!

173
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,470
DODGE: Give me your hand.
- Pull us up!

174
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,768
MUNDER:
Oh, God!

175
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,234
MURPHY:
I told you to watch your fucking step!

176
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:07,325
- Oh, shit. Oh, Jesus.
- From now on, you let me lead. Okay?

177
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,534
MURPHY:
Let's go.

178
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:14,206
- I think I just shit my pants.
DODGE: No, you always smell that way.

179
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,881
Compass is dead.

180
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,180
Helm's not responding, either.

181
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:17,061
Fuel tanks are empty. She must've rode
on full throttle till she was bone-dry.

182
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,941
Epps!

183
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,402
MURPHY:
Epps!

184
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:32,201
I'm looking for the ship's log.
Let's get this documentation back...

185
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,079
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

186
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:38,290
- You sure?
- Yeah.

187
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,918
Let's get to it.

188
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,425
DODGE:
Hey, check this out.

189
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:54,723
- It's a watch. Congratulations, buddy.
- No. Look again, you moron.

190
00:23:54,933 --> 00:24:00,354
It's a digital watch. Do the math. They
didn't have digital watches in 1962.

191
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:05,317
So we're not the first people to board
this ship. But she's ours now.

192
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:11,532
Let's get some sleep, tow her at dawn.
Let's hope there's no more surprises.

193
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,783
Amen to that.

194
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,291
MURPHY:
Oh, God.

195
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:28,632
Epps, can I get some tea?

196
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:35,473
Any sign of what might've happened?
How she got here?

197
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,851
That's the $64 million question,
isn't it?

198
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,021
- Ever hear of the ship Marie Celeste?
- No.

199
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:46,692
Twin-masted brigantine out of
Charleston during the Civil War.

200
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,404
MURPHY: She was bound for London
with a cargo of cotton.

201
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,822
Thanks.

202
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:57,786
Two months after she set sail, she was
sighted by fishermen off Tripoli.

203
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:01,207
She was doing 12 knots an hour
in a stiff breeze.

204
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:07,880
Something wasrt quite right. They
didn't know what so they went onboard.

205
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,841
You know what they found?

206
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,304
Nothing.

207
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,391
No passengers. No crew. No captain.

208
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,186
No sign of distress.

209
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:29,235
59 days after the last log entry, it had
traveled 4500 miles across the ocean...

210
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:35,533
...past the Rock of Gibraltar and into
the Mediterranean Sea at full sail.

211
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,994
And nobody at the helm.

212
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,498
MURPHY: What do you make of that?
- A ghost ship.

213
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:48,671
Hey, you smell that?
I smell bullshit.

214
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,802
- Been on the sea a lot longer than you.
- I know.

215
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,889
Seen things that
you can't even imagine.

216
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:04,562
Maritime history is full of
Marie Celestes.

217
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,398
So, what's our plan?

218
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:11,402
I think we should do what we came
to do. Tie her up, tug her in.

219
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,280
You think we can pull
this ocean liner?

220
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:15,781
Yeah.

221
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,243
SANTOS:
Not with the problems we got.

222
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:23,622
We could set her at anchor
and come back with two or three tugs.

223
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,417
No, some Russian trawler
will come along.

224
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:30,629
I've already looked for her anchors,
anyway. They're gone.

225
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,757
- What do you think?
- Get the engines working...

226
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:38,137
...it could take us two weeks
minimum to tow a vessel this size.

227
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:42,641
For my share of what she's won'th,
I'd drag her back to Anchorage myself.

228
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,155
Don't let go!

229
00:26:56,364 --> 00:27:01,118
MUNDER:
Help me! Don't let go!

230
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:07,124
- Thought you might want a jacket.
- Thanks.

231
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,471
Boy, do I miss that.

232
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,642
You okay? You seem quiet
since you came back.

233
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:31,398
I think I saw something
I couldn't possibly have seen.

234
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,485
- Like what?
- No, it's crazy.

235
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,904
I'm curious. Tell me.

236
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:45,329
I think I saw a little girl.

237
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,790
On...

238
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,167
On the... The boat?

239
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:55,130
Yeah. Looking right at me.

240
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,509
And then what happened?

241
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,303
Nothing. She disappeared.

242
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:06,016
Sometimes, when I'd be flying
for hours on end...

243
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:09,436
...l'd think I'd see stuff too.

244
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:14,024
It'd be there one second
and gone the next. Like a dream.

245
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,029
Thanks.

246
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,740
- See you in the a.m.
- Okay.

247
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,702
Good night.

248
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,541
JACK: See you tomorrow.
EPPS: Yeah.

249
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,899
She's got a big hole.
She's sinking.

250
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,781
- This is where the damage is. See?
- Breach in the hull, about 10 by 20...

251
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:07,619
...torn to the port collision bulkhead.
- Did it hit an iceberg?

252
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,914
DODGE: No, you don't need an iceberg
to rupture a hull.

253
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,374
I don't know.

254
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,794
- She's been hit recently.
- About a week ago, I'd say.

255
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,546
MURPHY:
This is where we are.

256
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:21,383
The problem's this group of islands.
Nothing spectacular...

257
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,927
...just rocks,
a couple thousand seals.

258
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,931
The Antonia Graza's caught here
in this strong current loop...

259
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:32,603
...and slowly she's been pushed towards
those rocks. Last time she hit them.

260
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,355
- What about next time?
- Wort be one.

261
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:39,318
We've got three days to fix it.
That's if the weather holds.

262
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,612
Why can't we tow it like it is?

263
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,948
Lt'd be like towing a car
with four flat tires.

264
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:50,454
- It's a bump in the road. We can fix it.
- Murph, bump in the road?

265
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:55,834
Look, the breach we can probably patch
if we can get to the inside.

266
00:29:56,377 --> 00:30:01,840
We'll weld shut the flooded compartments,
pump out the water up to the aft peak.

267
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,968
On top of that, the rudder's jammed.

268
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:09,807
MUNDER: We jerry-rig it, set a 38-degree
current drift to clear the island chain.

269
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,893
What does all that mean?

270
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,271
I just... That's a lot
of work for three days.

271
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:20,818
But with the gear we've got onboard
and what's on that ship, we can try.

272
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,444
We can do it, right?

273
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,241
With the gear we've got onboard,
I can't fix our engine.

274
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,577
Quit bitching and overhaul
the starboard engine.

275
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,205
- So that's the plan?
- Just do it.

276
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:41,630
- I'll call it in.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

277
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,258
- Maritime law states...
- I know.

278
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:50,347
We just don't want any
unexpected guests. Just leave it.

279
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:51,974
GREER:
Your call, captain.

280
00:30:56,813 --> 00:31:00,315
EPPS: All right, you know the drill.
We do a complete recon.

281
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:03,986
Make sure we've got no problems
before we get to work.

282
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:06,864
MURPHY: Stay with me. Don't wander.
GREER: Okay.

283
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,616
EPPS: Dodge, Munder, go to the port
collision bulkhead.

284
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:13,453
Jack and I'll work back from the fore.
Call if you need anything.

285
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:17,040
MUNDER: How about a pizza?
- You're so funny.

286
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:22,004
The only plan in this business is that
there is no plan. What is that?

287
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:27,718
What these people talking crazy for?
That's not even good English.

288
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,221
That's okay. Hang in there,
okay, preciosa?

289
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,600
Because someday he'll find
some other genius to fix his boat.

290
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,731
You want to play like that?

291
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,193
It's still sweet, though.

292
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,863
GREER:
Light coming up.

293
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,540
You were right. She is beautiful.

294
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,791
She sure is.

295
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:45,128
Epps, we're heading for
the main engine room. Epps?

296
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,298
Epps?

297
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,030
All right, capitano.

298
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:10,672
I'm just slipping in the darkness

299
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,450
Oh, shit.

300
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,912
We're gonna have to dive
to get to that tear.

301
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,375
Epps, the engine room
is totally flooded.

302
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,961
Epps, can you hear me?

303
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,470
Wait!

304
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,684
What happened? You okay?

305
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:49,646
What are you doing down there?
Did you hurt yourself?

306
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,144
What are you doing?

307
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,984
The whole bottom's riddled with them.

308
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,570
JACK: Looks like someone
used it for target practice.

309
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:42,490
- That's the happy version.
- What's the not-so-happy version?

310
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,243
There were people in there.

311
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,579
I saw that little girl again.

312
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,749
What? Where?

313
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:56,087
- I must be losing my goddamn mind.
- Well, did she say anything?

314
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,924
Forget it. Come on.

315
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,577
Murphy, come in.

316
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,871
Dodge! Anybody!

317
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,250
Shit.

318
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,631
I think she's fucking with us.

319
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:26,344
EPPS:
Looks like central laundry.

320
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:36,187
This vent connects to the forward hold.
We need to see if it's flooded.

321
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,816
- I may need help shutting it.
- You sure we need to...?

322
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,170
Murphy, where the hell are you?

323
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,882
- How long have they been here?
- A month, maybe less.

324
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:07,260
- What are we gonna do?
- Get off this boat!

325
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,846
- But the ship...
- lf it sinks, it sinks.

326
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,057
You're right.

327
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,351
JACK:
Stinks.

328
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,605
- What the hell?
- We came through there.

329
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,523
No shit!

330
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,237
EPPS:
Come on!

331
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,202
This way. Come on, Jack.

332
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,387
GREER:
What the...?

333
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,730
Wherd you start
wearing lipstick, Epps?

334
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,191
Epps?

335
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,072
GREER:
"Francesca."

336
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,241
Nice titties.

337
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:17,414
Not that you can hold a candle
to the future Mrs. Greer, though.

338
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:35,390
EPPS: Come on, Jack. Stop dragging ass!
What's your problem?

339
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,439
JACK:
What's this?

340
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,984
Forget it. Let's go! Jack!

341
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:51,406
'58 Jaguar X150. I've dreamt
about this car since I was a kid.

342
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:55,910
We have to get out of here now.
Do you understand? Now.

343
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:06,129
There's something moving in there.

344
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,272
Fuck!

345
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:27,108
Oh, my God!
I hate rats!

346
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,362
EPPS:
What?

347
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,616
JACK:
Oh, my God! Look at this!

348
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:36,993
I have to get Murphy.

349
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,953
Murphy!

350
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,455
JACK:
Murphy!

351
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,795
Is someone trying to call me?

352
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,215
Dodge! Munder!

353
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,134
VOICE:
Maureen...

354
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,845
Who's Maureen?

355
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,306
It's my first name.

356
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:03,520
VOICE: It's cold...
- He said "cold"?

357
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,647
The galley.

358
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:18,159
VOICE 1: It's cold.
VOICE 2: Please help us.

359
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,542
Don't go in there.

360
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:07,041
You fucking assholes!
Fuck you!

361
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,003
Take it easy!

362
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:14,465
You were fucking with us. We fucked
with you. Why aren't you laughing?

363
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:19,095
Wanna hear something funnier? We
found dead guys in the laundry room.

364
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:23,057
And this in the cargo hold.

365
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,405
Need some help, skipper?

366
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,286
I'm sorry.

367
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,847
MURPHY: Jesus.
GREER: Oh, man.

368
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,141
MUNDER:
Holy shit!

369
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,105
Yeah!

370
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,983
MUNDER:
We're rich!

371
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,321
DODGE: You son of a bitch!
MUNDER: Rich!

372
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:25,036
MURPHY: Come on. Let's go.
DODGE: Move this shit out!

373
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,122
One. Two. Three...

374
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,309
How much you figure it's won'th, boss?

375
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:53,648
There's a lot of gold. Hard to know.
Two, 300 million, maybe. Maybe more.

376
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,566
EPPS: Jesus.
GREER: I don't know.

377
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:59,153
Lock boxes with half of Fort Knox
in them? They gotta be insured.

378
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:02,824
No way somebody will let
this much gold float away.

379
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:06,160
Well, the markings have been
filed down.

380
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:10,748
GREER: What does that mean?
- Someone didn't want this traceable.

381
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,000
It's stolen.

382
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:17,922
It may have to do with the reason
this ship disappeared when it did.

383
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,509
Wait. If the gold's got
something to do with 1962...

384
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:25,888
...what about the bodies? They can't be
more than three weeks old.

385
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:31,185
Somebody's gotta say it, and it might as
well be me. This ship is fucked up.

386
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:36,566
Earlier I could swear I heard
a woman singing. It's like she was...

387
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,402
- Like she was coming on to me.
DODGE: Oh, no!

388
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:46,868
It was the sexiest voice
I ever heard, man.

389
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:53,291
- She got any backup singers?
- Whatever you're on, get me some!

390
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,545
Maybe you're not quite
ready to get married, Greer.

391
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,088
- Fuck you.
EPPS: Okay, guys.

392
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,300
- What about the Coast Guard?
DODGE: No.

393
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:07,096
You call the Coast Guard... What if
the gold did turn out to be stolen?

394
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:13,728
Under maritime law, anything
found in international waters...

395
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:17,565
...belongs to the finder. Okay?
That is the law.

396
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:20,401
- Right.
- Finders keepers.

397
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,446
If we're gonna do this,
I say we do it now.

398
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:27,950
Get our boat going, grab the gold
and get the hell out of here.

399
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:31,120
We leave the boat, take the gold.
Who's with me?

400
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:34,248
I'm with the gold, man.

401
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,834
Gold.

402
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,295
The gold.

403
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,843
- Epps?
- I just want to get off this boat.

404
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:48,262
Okay. Let's go to work.

405
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:55,019
GREER: Warrior is in position, Murph.
Can we please get the hell out of here?

406
00:46:56,647 --> 00:47:01,567
Yeah, precjosa! Smell that money!
100 million. You hear what I'm saying?

407
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,486
100 million!

408
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,698
Greer? Get those engines going.

409
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,784
MURPHY:
I'm bringing the gold down.

410
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,661
Yes, sir, captain, sir.

411
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:17,750
Hey, Santos. Hurry your ass up,
vato. We almost got the gold. Andale!

412
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:22,380
I wanna see these gauges rocking,
because you just had an overhaul.

413
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:26,467
SANTOS: And you, I want you
to give me some too.

414
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,349
Let's do this!

415
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:36,352
SANTOS:
Hey, yo, Greer! Fire it up!

416
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:40,523
We're going to haul ass.
Bring it on! We'll be so fucking rich!

417
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,568
GIRL:
Stop!

418
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,279
Stop! You don't know
what you're doing!

419
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,031
We're good to go, skipper.

420
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,203
Don't start the boats! He'll...

421
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:57,915
Shit!

422
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,167
Greer!

423
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,047
What the hell happened?

424
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,760
DODGE:
Jesus Christ! Fire on deck!

425
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:23,441
EPPS:
Santos! Greer! Munder!

426
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,751
I got you.

427
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:46,005
JACK: Epps! I got Munder!
- Greer!

428
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,425
Come on!

429
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:54,430
Santos!
Santos, answer me!

430
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,767
Santos!

431
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:20,957
I don't know what happened.
The engine room just blew.

432
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:25,252
Maybe Santos rushed the engines,
didn't seal up the gaskets right...

433
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:29,966
Jack, did you find anything out about
this ship before you sent us out here?

434
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:34,595
No, but I... Look, we've got
the gold, and we are still alive.

435
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,515
- Tell that to Santos, asshole!
- Ease up!

436
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,475
This is bullshit!

437
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,852
Santos came here out of free will...

438
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,939
...just like us.
- What does that mean?

439
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,316
- Enough!
DODGE: Santos is dead because of you!

440
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:50,194
Come on! It's not gonna
bring him back.

441
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:13,134
Murph, it's not your fault.
You know that.

442
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,637
Murph...

443
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,189
DODGE:
How is he?

444
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:34,030
Here's the plan. We're professional
salvors with a fortune onboard.

445
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:37,533
I say we do what we do best:
Fix this rust bucket.

446
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,286
Control her drift. Clear those islands.

447
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,997
We can survive long enough
to get picked up.

448
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:46,250
Why is this a question?
We have the materials.

449
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:52,048
Why don't we build a raft and leave?
There is something wrong with this boat!

450
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:55,718
- Lf we stay here, we may not survive.
- You want to build a raft?

451
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,554
- I want to build a raft.
- Even with the Warrior...

452
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:02,975
...we were stretching to do this
in three days. We can't do this.

453
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,603
You're the best spot-welder I know.

454
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,730
We can do it right now,
but I need you.

455
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:16,238
Fine. But there's no way we're doing
a major patch-and-pump in the dark.

456
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,866
Even with the lights we have,
it'd be like going in blind.

457
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:22,578
Okay, fine. We'll chill tonight
and go in the a.m.

458
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,250
Greer? What do you say?

459
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:32,338
Now you want to know what
the first mate has to say?

460
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:36,801
I say go to hell, Epps. You're not
qualified to get us off this ship.

461
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:40,221
Had Murphy let me do it my way,
we wouldn't be in this.

462
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,433
- And the Coast Guard...
- So it's everybody else's fault, right?

463
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,895
They'd be here and we'd
be on our way home, millionaires.

464
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:49,271
MUNDER:
That's bullshit.

465
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,899
Grow up, asshole.

466
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:57,279
Fucking bitch! Keep fucking talking.
Say another word!

467
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:00,199
Say another word!

468
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,419
EPPS:
Here it is. Katie. B-deck.

469
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,004
You were alone.

470
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:02,845
DODGE 100-to-1, someone
poisoned the passengers to get the gold.

471
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:06,849
MUNDER: Okay, Sherlock, if they were
poisoned, why are these cans safe?

472
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:11,020
DODGE: They're still sealed.
It's been sealed for 40 years. It's safe.

473
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:14,398
MUNDER:
Okay, shoot for it. Loser goes first.

474
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:19,361
- Ah! Paper beats rock.
- Come on, man, best of three.

475
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:22,698
- Bullshit. You lost.
- Where's your empathy?

476
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:27,328
Winners do not empathize
with losers. Bon appétit.

477
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,589
I screwed up.

478
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,050
I should've called it in.

479
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,637
Damn! I knew better!

480
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:49,016
I'll make it home to you, baby.
I swear.

481
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,687
What the hell are you looking at?

482
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,199
- That's all right.
- No way.

483
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:08,577
No, really. It's good.
Look, I'm not kidding.

484
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:11,914
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious. It's good!

485
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:17,753
- Oh, wow. You gotta try that!
- That's good!

486
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:18,963
That's great!

487
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,966
Katie?

488
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,141
EPPS:
Katie?

489
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,664
DODGE: Can I tell you something else?
We get back...

490
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:58,460
...l'm gonna take my money
and I'm gonna buy you a bathtub.

491
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:03,674
I'll get you a lifetime supply
of titty magazines and toilet paper!

492
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:06,677
I already beat you to it, bro!

493
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,642
There's something on your...

494
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,580
Katie?

495
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,266
Who, me?

496
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,358
Francesca, I know
all of this isn't real.

497
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:53,904
So I'm just gonna go with it, okay?

498
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:00,369
Can't cheat on your fiancée
with a dead girl, right?

499
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,607
Her parents.

500
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,279
KATIE:
Please.

501
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,658
Don't close it.

502
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:45,747
Havert seen them for years.

503
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:49,042
They moved to New York.

504
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:52,713
I was on my way to join them.

505
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:55,966
But they're dead now.

506
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,929
EPPS: How would you know?
- When you're like this...

507
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,973
...you know these things.

508
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,476
My mother...

509
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:11,273
...she made me this dress.

510
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:12,649
Do you like it?

511
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:20,115
You remind me of her.

512
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,952
I don't think so.

513
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:30,083
Well, here. You should have this back.

514
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:40,135
Oh, God, you really are
a fucking ghost.

515
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:47,100
Where are you going?

516
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:00,238
Santos. Povero Santos.

517
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:04,701
Santos was my goddamn responsibility.

518
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:21,968
- The Lorelei.
- She was adrift. We rescued her.

519
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,347
MURPHY:
I've heard the story of the Lorelej.

520
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,976
I didn't know the Graza was involved.

521
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:35,023
The gold was onboard the Lorelej?

522
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:41,738
It says here, "May 19, 1962."

523
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:46,201
That's two days before
your ship disappeared.

524
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:51,957
There were no survivors
onboard the Lorelej.

525
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:00,882
Jesus Christ!

526
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:08,181
Where you going?

527
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:31,705
Most spirits are free
to be with their families.

528
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:34,875
So why aren't you with yours?

529
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:41,548
- We're all trapped here.
- Who?

530
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,093
My shipmates and I.

531
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,430
Even the ones who aren't marked.

532
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:49,973
Marked?

533
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:52,434
Katie, what do you mean?

534
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,103
When the boat's full...

535
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:57,898
What? You can tell me.

536
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:03,612
When he has all the souls he needs
and has filled his quota...

537
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:08,074
...we'll all be ferried...

538
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:10,118
...to...

539
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,121
What is it? What's wrong?

540
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:18,627
- What is it?
- He doesn't want me talking to you.

541
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,463
- He who?
- But I'm not like the others!

542
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:23,298
You need to tell me.

543
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:27,803
You must go at once.
Leave the ship while you still can!

544
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:29,846
Katie, what is it?

545
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:36,478
Katie! Katie?

546
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,104
MURPHY:
Epps?

547
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,690
Come on!

548
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:42,776
We have to leave.

549
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:47,364
Where you going, Murphy? Huh?

550
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,662
What's the matter? It's me.

551
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,330
Santos.

552
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:59,543
It's no fun lying
at the bottom of the ocean.

553
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:06,842
No lights at the end of the tunnel.
Not for me, Murph.

554
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,971
No 10,000 virgins at the pearly gates. No.

555
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:17,686
Because of the plan, I'm trapped
on this dreamboat of yours.

556
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:22,357
So you know what?
You're coming along for the ride.

557
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:46,381
No!

558
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:55,849
Murphy?

559
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:06,151
Murph?

560
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:09,446
You all right, Murph?

561
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,074
You okay?

562
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:19,456
- What's the matter, Murph?
- It's me!

563
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:30,592
EPPS: It's me!
- Do it, come on. It'll make you feel good.

564
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,100
Come on!

565
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:48,401
- Come on!
JACK: Hey!

566
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:59,120
Oh, God.
Epps, you okay?

567
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:07,295
JACK: Keep him in the aquarium.
EPPS: No, listen. He was drunk.

568
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:10,298
He didn't know what he was doing.

569
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:14,552
Look, he just tried to kill you.
He stays in there.

570
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:17,806
DODGE:
Let's go find Greer.

571
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,194
EPPS:
Any sign of him?

572
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:32,988
MUNDER:
No, we looked all over.

573
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:36,324
DODGE: Mars pissed off.
Seems to happen on this boat.

574
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:40,328
DODGE: Least we werert around in '62.
- The passengers were poisoned...

575
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:44,624
...to get to the gold? Isn't that...?
- Extreme? Maybe, but if the shoe fits...

576
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:47,961
Next thing you know,
we'll be trying to kill each other.

577
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:52,173
- What's with the heart?
- Found it. Belonged to this little girl.

578
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:55,927
- What girl?
- She told me to get off this boat.

579
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:59,639
- She's talking to you now?
- What are you talking about?

580
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:03,184
MUNDER: You're seeing ghosts, Epps?
- Just forget it.

581
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:05,395
So the ship's got a few kinks.

582
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:09,649
Let's stick with Munder's specs
and try to fix the ship.

583
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:13,153
No way five people and the gold
will fit on any raft.

584
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:16,823
Murphy's not going anywhere,
and we're not leaving him here.

585
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:21,077
We stick with the plan. Fix the boat.
Let's get going. Come on.

586
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:34,174
MUNDER
That's the collision bulkhead hatch.

587
01:07:34,508 --> 01:07:38,053
DODGE: Wheel's busted. It won't open.
EPPS: Arming the C4.

588
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:39,345
EPPS: Dodge?
DODGE: I'm good.

589
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:40,889
EPPS: Munder?
MUNDER: I'm good.

590
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:43,016
EPPS:
Contact.

591
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:50,899
MUNDER: There's the tear, portside.
DODGE: Looks bigger from here.

592
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,693
MUNDER:
I'll shut her up, no problem.

593
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:59,282
EPPS:
Munder, rudder's fixed. You all right?

594
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:01,409
MUNDER:
I'm good.

595
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:05,747
EPPS: What do you think, Dodge?
DODGE: She'll hold.

596
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:12,045
MUNDER: We're set with the pumps.
- Start them up.

597
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:16,382
MUNDER: Copy that, Epps.
One and two, kicking in.

598
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:20,178
DODGE: I give it 12 hours till she's dry.
MUNDER: Both on full.

599
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:23,431
MUNDER:
Get ready, Epps. Here it comes.

600
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:24,974
EPPS:
Great work, guys.

601
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:46,496
EPPS:
Damn. Current's faster than I thought.

602
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:54,796
If we control her drift, headed in this
direction, we should clear those islands.

603
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,882
We'll keep it afloat
until we get picked up.

604
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:01,302
DODGE: Son of a bitch.
We may just get out of this yet.

605
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:02,679
Kazillionaires.

606
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:05,640
Check on the bridge
when you're done here.

607
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:08,351
I'll see if I can find Greer
down below.

608
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:15,024
EPPS:
Greer?

609
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:18,403
Greer?

610
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,209
Katie?

611
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:48,016
Greer? Jesus!

612
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:58,359
- Oh, shit.
- Number two's clogged. Who's going?

613
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:00,570
You go.

614
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:04,407
Shit. Every single time!

615
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:10,121
Oh, my God.

616
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:12,165
KATIE:
Come with me.

617
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:15,919
I want to show you something.

618
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:23,958
Murphy.

619
01:14:26,211 --> 01:14:27,712
Murphy!

620
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:40,475
No!

621
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:42,810
Come on! No!

622
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:45,563
Come on!

623
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:49,984
You can't die on me!

624
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:47,041
Dodge. Murphy's dead.

625
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,585
- What?
- We have to get off this boat.

626
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:53,965
There's a reason you, me and Munder are
still alive. That's why he came after us.

627
01:15:54,132 --> 01:15:58,094
- To fix his ship.
- I just saw Murphy. What's happening?

628
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,848
I don't know.

629
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,478
I want you and Dodge
on the rudder.

630
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:09,897
- But you just said...
- Listen to me.

631
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:16,404
I'll get Munder, we'll see if the welds
are holding. Stay here till we get back.

632
01:16:16,613 --> 01:16:20,116
I do not want you out of
each other's sight. Take this.

633
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:22,743
Take it.

634
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:27,665
- Be careful down there.
- I will.

635
01:16:56,069 --> 01:16:59,739
Munder!

636
01:17:22,387 --> 01:17:25,640
- That's it, then. We made it.
- For now.

637
01:17:26,224 --> 01:17:29,310
- I'll check on Epps.
- No, she said to wait here.

638
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:32,938
- Yeah, but...
- Hey, she said to wait! So wait.

639
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:48,454
You disgust me.

640
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:51,415
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

641
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:55,628
You're a pathetic excuse for a man.
She says, "Jump," and you jump.

642
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:59,006
You're disgusting.
I don't have time for this.

643
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:09,642
- Who the hell are you?
- The question is, who are you?

644
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:13,187
You worship her, yet you've
never had the balls to tell her...

645
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:16,023
...because you're a weak,
cowardly child.

646
01:18:16,608 --> 01:18:22,571
However, if you'll kindly step out of
my way, I'll make your dream a reality.

647
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:27,493
You know, Dodge, if you kill somebody,
you go to hell.

648
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:33,416
Well, you live for her.
You willing to die for her?

649
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:14,415
DODGE:
Epps.

650
01:19:17,627 --> 01:19:21,005
I shot Ferriman. He's dead.

651
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:23,924
Yeah? Don't be so sure, Dodge.

652
01:19:24,134 --> 01:19:27,970
- What are you doing?
- Trip's over. I'm sinking the boat.

653
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:30,765
- It's taken its last victim.
- That'll kill us.

654
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:33,601
- We'll have to take our chances.
- What about the gold?

655
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:38,147
Fucking kidding? We're not getting the
gold off this boat. Nobody ever does.

656
01:19:38,356 --> 01:19:40,274
Wait, wait. Wait!

657
01:19:40,817 --> 01:19:44,570
That gold can give us everything
we ever wanted.

658
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:48,324
We could have our own boat.
The two of us.

659
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:51,744
We could have a life together.
You and me.

660
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:56,165
What are you talking about?
Dodge, we gotta get out of here. Now.

661
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:59,376
Well, I can't let you do that.

662
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:08,928
So that's it, huh?

663
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:13,474
All right. Okay.

664
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:16,018
You win. All right.

665
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:20,981
Fucking bitch!

666
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:23,818
All right, you win! Go ahead, do it!

667
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:26,278
Go ahead. Blow it up!

668
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:27,863
Kill us all!

669
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:35,162
Hey, Dodge. Why haven't you
asked me where Munder is?

670
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:45,297
Well, I suppose that's because...

671
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:48,342
...I already know.

672
01:20:48,885 --> 01:20:52,221
- You won't pull that trigger, Maureen.
- Try me.

673
01:20:52,722 --> 01:20:55,975
Dodge made the same mistake.
He's dead.

674
01:20:58,019 --> 01:20:59,854
Katie told you, didn't she?

675
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:04,233
Souls without sin can't be marked.
Makes them tough to control.

676
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:07,820
But as long as I keep the boat afloat,
we'll all go down together.

677
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:11,448
- What the fuck are you?
- I'm a salvager.

678
01:21:11,616 --> 01:21:16,537
Just like you.
You collect ships, I collect souls.

679
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:20,249
And when I fill my quota,
I send a boatload home.

680
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:24,211
This will make management happy.
You see, it's a job.

681
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:27,047
Given to me after a lifetime of sin.

682
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:32,887
So if I lose this ship, management won't
be happy, which is not a good thing.

683
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:37,433
I'm not getting through to you.
I'm asking for an exchange.

684
01:21:37,767 --> 01:21:40,060
This ship for your life.

685
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:42,354
I want my crew back.

686
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:46,567
Sorry. Once a passenger's marked,
they're mine.

687
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:49,445
Then I guess it's over.

688
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:01,373
All you had to do was fix the ship!

689
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:08,297
I gave you a great opportunity.

690
01:22:08,673 --> 01:22:10,883
All you had to do was take it.

691
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:18,557
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

692
01:25:42,428 --> 01:25:45,264
Careful. Hang in there, ma'am.

693
01:26:11,374 --> 01:26:13,333
No!
