1
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,434
I can't hold her much longer.
She's taking on too much water.

2
00:05:37,684 --> 00:05:43,230
- What is going on back there?
- Keep your pants on, Murphy.

3
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,985
We blew the starboard engine.
Port engine's way too hot.

4
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:53,153
- Hold on.
- Shorten the tow or cut her loose.

5
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:54,321
Epps...

6
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:58,448
<i>...get off my damn tugboat.
We don't have much time.</i>

7
00:05:58,698 --> 00:06:04,411
<i>Move it, Epps. If she sinks,
she's taking us with her.</i>

8
00:06:10,164 --> 00:06:12,041
Got a punch in the port floater.

9
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,209
<i>- Five minutes before she floods.
- Less than that!</i>

10
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,920
Get back here.
We're cutting her loose.

11
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,670
- Cut her loose.
- That's it. Get back here.

12
00:06:20,921 --> 00:06:22,631
Come on! You heard the man!

13
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:28,801
Took us three months to get her off
the bottom. I will not lose her now!

14
00:06:29,051 --> 00:06:31,929
Goddamn it, Epps!
You can't fix everything!

15
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:33,019
Christ!

16
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:45,437
<i>- For the last time, get back here!
- She's taking on too much water!</i>

17
00:06:46,313 --> 00:06:52,400
<i>Why do you always have to break
my balls? I said get back here!</i>

18
00:06:54,276 --> 00:07:01,115
<i>Do you want me to come down there
and kick your ass? Because I'll do it.</i>

19
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:09,494
Here's to the best damn
salvage crew in the business!

20
00:07:09,744 --> 00:07:13,205
- We did it, guys!
- Yeah, look at that!

21
00:07:13,455 --> 00:07:17,756
All right. Nice work.

22
00:07:17,756 --> 00:07:22,837
- Here's to the fucking sea!
- To the sea.

23
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:27,881
To a job well done.

24
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:32,926
Mr. Murphy? I'm Jack Ferriman. I was
wondering if I could buy you a drink.

25
00:07:33,176 --> 00:07:36,762
He doesn't drink.

26
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,974
Could I talk to you alone?

27
00:07:42,224 --> 00:07:47,519
You talk to me, you talk to my crew.
That's the way it is.

28
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:52,272
I fly the Arctic Weather Patrol flights
out of Mackenzie Bay.

29
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:58,026
Last month I was out in the middle
of the Strait when I came across this.

30
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:01,695
Congratulations. You found a boat.

31
00:08:01,945 --> 00:08:05,197
In the middle of the ocean,
of all places.

32
00:08:05,448 --> 00:08:08,533
I tried for radio contact
and got nothing...

33
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:11,744
...so I figured she had to be adrift.

34
00:08:11,994 --> 00:08:13,494
In the Bering Strait?

35
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:17,080
That's miles from shipping lanes.
Did you alert the Coast Guard?

36
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,291
It's international waters,
so they noted it and that's it.

37
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,917
You get a name?

38
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:27,503
No, I put it out of my head until
two days ago when I saw it again.

39
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:31,089
What are we talking about?
What kind of tonnage?

40
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:35,383
Big. Huge.
Could be military.

41
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:39,261
Let's say that we're
a little bit interested.

42
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:41,763
What's in it for you?

43
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:45,766
I want 20% finder's fee,
whatever she's worth.

44
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:51,895
- Have you told anyone else about this?
- Not a living soul.

45
00:08:52,936 --> 00:08:57,648
- Give us a minute, will you?
- Okay.

46
00:08:57,898 --> 00:09:00,567
So? What do you think, Murph?

47
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:03,651
Who knows? Could be full of shit.

48
00:09:03,902 --> 00:09:08,113
I do know one thing. I've seen strange
things happen in the Strait.

49
00:09:08,363 --> 00:09:12,407
I know something else:
Sea gives you an opportunity, take it.

50
00:09:12,657 --> 00:09:17,619
That's at least a week out of our way.
We've been out for six months already.

51
00:09:17,869 --> 00:09:22,164
I got a fiancée waiting, remember?
I'm getting married in a month.

52
00:09:22,414 --> 00:09:26,541
Plan was to go back to Anchorage.
Starboard diesel needs an overhaul.

53
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:31,128
- In our business, the only plan is:
- There is no plan.

54
00:09:31,378 --> 00:09:36,465
If you don't want to go, that's fine.
Let's tell him we'll get somebody else.

55
00:09:36,715 --> 00:09:42,803
Wait a minute. Let's not be hasty.
What's a ship like that worth?

56
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:44,137
Who knows?

57
00:09:44,388 --> 00:09:48,973
Millions? Thousands? Could be nothing.
Depends on a lot of things.

58
00:09:49,224 --> 00:09:52,975
- Mainly, if we have the right to salvage.
- Pretty big "if".

59
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:56,978
- What's the split?
- We split it even, six ways.

60
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:00,689
- Even split?
- Beats me paying you overtime.

61
00:10:00,939 --> 00:10:03,775
I'm good.

62
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:04,865
I'm in.

63
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,195
Greer? What do you say?

64
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:13,322
All right.

65
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:19,576
Hey, Ferriman! Can you come over here?

66
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:26,456
So this is the way it works.
10% instead of your 20% finder's fee.

67
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:32,794
I can't let you take advantage of me
like that.

68
00:10:33,044 --> 00:10:37,380
That's the way it is.
Take it or leave it.

69
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:46,261
Fine. But I go with you.

70
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:48,594
Not on my boat, you don't.

71
00:10:48,845 --> 00:10:52,890
Think I'd tell you where a fortune
might be without insurance?

72
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,517
There are five other boats
that would jump at this.

73
00:10:56,767 --> 00:11:01,312
I come with you.
So you take it or leave it.

74
00:11:32,248 --> 00:11:34,834
Things are dull!

75
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:40,046
She'll love it. What do you think?

76
00:11:40,296 --> 00:11:44,716
Too much off the sides, but I can
come up with something she'll love.

77
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:48,134
- Shave that yourself.
- Don't want to help me out?

78
00:11:48,384 --> 00:11:55,014
Who the fuck are you kidding? Everybody
knows you Navy boys take it up the ass.

79
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:17,528
- Enjoying the ride, Jack?
- No, sir.

80
00:12:30,036 --> 00:12:33,456
Not the same as flying planes
over ice sheets, is it?

81
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:36,999
- What's the appeal?
- I could ask you the same thing.

82
00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:41,795
What's a nice girl doing in a dump
like this instead of raising a family?

83
00:12:42,044 --> 00:12:45,630
I own a third of Murphy's operation.
I'm not that nice.

84
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,882
And these monkeys are my family.

85
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:53,426
<i>Santos to Murphy. Come in.</i>

86
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,180
- Yeah?
- I think you should get up here.

87
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:03,891
<i>- What is it?
- I think you should see this!</i>

88
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:08,478
It was there a second ago!
Ten miles to the northwest.

89
00:13:08,728 --> 00:13:12,356
Would you turn off that fucking music?

90
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:16,150
I'm telling you, there must be a glitch.
I saw it with my own eyes.

91
00:13:16,401 --> 00:13:21,654
- Glitch, my ass. There's nothing there.
- Give me a look at this.

92
00:13:22,153 --> 00:13:27,699
There it is! Right in front of you!
Tell me you don't see nothing.

93
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:32,994
Do you see what I'm saying?
Do you see what I'm saying to you?

94
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:39,790
<i>- Dodge, could you get on the bow light?
- All right, Murph.</i>

95
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:47,628
- It's there, right?
- There's something there.

96
00:13:53,924 --> 00:13:57,760
Hey, Murph, what's up?

97
00:13:58,428 --> 00:14:01,679
<i>Vessel at position 7-5 north...</i>

98
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:05,057
...this is "Arctic Warrior".

99
00:14:05,308 --> 00:14:06,268
<i>Come in.</i>

100
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:13,979
This is tugboat "Arctic Warrior".
Do you read me?

101
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,355
This is "Arctic Warrior".

102
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,816
<i>Do you read me? Come in.</i>

103
00:14:38,954 --> 00:14:40,204
Shit!

104
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:11,141
- Now do you believe me?
- Holy shit!

105
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:16,479
An ocean liner?
Where did that come from?

106
00:15:23,358 --> 00:15:26,485
It's the "Antonia Graza".

107
00:15:26,735 --> 00:15:29,528
Jesus Christ.

108
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:34,156
<i>This is civilian tugboat "Arctic Warrior".
Is there anyone aboard?</i>

109
00:15:34,406 --> 00:15:38,368
<i>This is civilian tugboat "Arctic Warrior".
Is there anyone aboard?</i>

110
00:15:38,618 --> 00:15:43,871
This is "Arctic Warrior".
Can you read us?

111
00:15:45,997 --> 00:15:50,626
- You know her, Murphy?
- Only in my dreams.

112
00:15:55,962 --> 00:15:59,632
Christ, she's beautiful.

113
00:15:59,882 --> 00:16:06,886
Italian liners couldn't compete for speed,
so they built floating art palaces instead.

114
00:16:07,136 --> 00:16:12,014
She was reported missing May 21,
1962, off the coast of Labrador.

115
00:16:12,265 --> 00:16:17,643
Funny thing is, there was no distress
signal. She just disappeared.

116
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:24,565
Ever since, every captain's been looking
for her, hoping she hasn't gone down.

117
00:16:24,855 --> 00:16:27,733
- Do you know what this means?
- What?

118
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:33,112
Under the law of the sea, she's ours.
Let's not keep a lady waiting.

119
00:16:33,362 --> 00:16:38,407
Santos, bring us alongside. Fire up
the crane. We got business to do.

120
00:16:38,657 --> 00:16:44,201
When we get onboard, stay together. We
don't know what kind of shape she's in.

121
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:48,163
<i>- Take us up, Greer.
- Aye, aye, captain.</i>

122
00:16:48,414 --> 00:16:54,792
Hey, Murphy, please remember to keep
all channels open. Thank you.

123
00:16:57,544 --> 00:16:59,336
They won't let me go.

124
00:16:59,587 --> 00:17:03,715
Safety first.
That's why you go last, Jack.

125
00:17:03,964 --> 00:17:06,758
Can you sit down?
I'm trying to keep this steady.

126
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:10,094
- I just want...
- Sit down! Get out of the way!

127
00:17:10,344 --> 00:17:11,594
Okay.

128
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:18,849
She's had some battering over
the last 40 years, you can tell.

129
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:22,977
<i>Stand by. Setting you down topside.</i>

130
00:17:24,103 --> 00:17:26,605
She's still a beaut.

131
00:17:26,855 --> 00:17:30,107
Unbelievable.

132
00:17:30,357 --> 00:17:33,066
You better stay alert. Watch your step.

133
00:17:33,317 --> 00:17:36,612
40 years of rust can turn
deck plates into quicksand.

134
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:41,697
We'll make our way in at the fore,
then check the bridge. This way. Careful.

135
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:47,659
<i>- Forward mast is history.
- Epps and Murphy, are they a couple?</i>

136
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:52,538
Hell, no. She's like a daughter to him.
He'd be lost without her.

137
00:17:52,788 --> 00:17:56,624
Superstructure's in decent shape.
No sign of damage.

138
00:17:56,874 --> 00:18:03,712
<i>- Lifeboats are gone, stern to bow.
- Life preserver lockers are all empty.</i>

139
00:18:03,962 --> 00:18:06,547
Sure no survivors ever
turned up, Murph?

140
00:18:06,797 --> 00:18:11,592
Sure as we're walking on
the "Graza", Dodge. This way.

141
00:18:23,892 --> 00:18:24,972
Let's go.

142
00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:38,652
Jesus. She's no fiddler's green.

143
00:18:38,902 --> 00:18:41,946
<i>You're wrong, Munder. She's beautiful.</i>

144
00:18:42,196 --> 00:18:46,990
Whoever was on here originally
sure left in a hurry.

145
00:18:48,784 --> 00:18:51,326
Murphy, come in.

146
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:08,462
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome aboard. I'm Julie.

147
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:13,215
I'll be your hostess this evening.

148
00:19:15,926 --> 00:19:19,219
Have some respect, okay?

149
00:19:26,307 --> 00:19:28,976
Check out all those champagne bottles.

150
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:31,937
Looks like we missed
one hell of a party.

151
00:19:32,187 --> 00:19:36,356
- And one hell of a hangover.
- Shut up!

152
00:20:03,915 --> 00:20:05,750
- Shut up!
- Let's find the bridge.

153
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,335
- Such a manly man.
- What?

154
00:20:09,586 --> 00:20:11,587
- You all right?
- Shut up!

155
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:15,964
Come on, Mary, let's go.

156
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,844
Murph, how many passengers
did she carry?

157
00:20:23,094 --> 00:20:27,681
Over 600. The créme de la créme
of society from all over Europe.

158
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:29,682
Crew of 500 from Italy.

159
00:20:29,931 --> 00:20:34,102
Talk to me. How's everything going?

160
00:20:39,189 --> 00:20:43,608
Okay, good. This companionway
should get us to the bridge.

161
00:20:43,858 --> 00:20:47,861
Here, Epps, hold this.

162
00:21:04,621 --> 00:21:07,415
What's going on?

163
00:21:07,665 --> 00:21:10,417
- After you.
- No, after you.

164
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:13,960
No, no. After me.

165
00:21:14,211 --> 00:21:17,339
Tough guy.

166
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:33,348
Don't let go!

167
00:21:33,598 --> 00:21:37,851
- Pull! Pull!
- Please, Epps!

168
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,813
Please, Epps, don't let go!

169
00:21:42,062 --> 00:21:46,191
- Give me your hand.
- Pull us up!

170
00:21:48,858 --> 00:21:49,818
Oh, God!

171
00:21:55,363 --> 00:21:59,950
I told you to watch your fucking step!

172
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:05,411
- Oh, shit. Oh, Jesus.
- From now on, you let me lead. Okay?

173
00:22:05,662 --> 00:22:07,830
Let's go.

174
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,917
- I think I just shit my pants.
- No, you always smell that way.

175
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:03,575
Compass is dead.

176
00:23:07,577 --> 00:23:09,619
Helm's not responding, either.

177
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:16,750
Fuel tanks are empty. She must've rode
on full throttle till she was bone-dry.

178
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,750
Epps!

179
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:30,717
I'm looking for the ship's log.
Let's get this documentation back...

180
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:33,509
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

181
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,721
- You sure?
- Yeah.

182
00:23:36,971 --> 00:23:40,598
Let's get to it.

183
00:23:43,808 --> 00:23:47,102
Hey, check this out.

184
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:52,814
- It's a watch. Congratulations, buddy.
- No. Look again, you moron.

185
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:58,401
It's a digital watch. Do the math. They
didn't have digital watches in 1962.

186
00:23:58,693 --> 00:24:03,404
So we're not the first people to board
this ship. But she's ours now.

187
00:24:03,654 --> 00:24:09,617
Let's get some sleep, tow her at dawn.
Let's hope there's no more surprises.

188
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:12,494
Amen to that.

189
00:24:16,287 --> 00:24:17,247
Oh, God.

190
00:24:23,209 --> 00:24:28,338
Epps, can I get some tea?

191
00:24:29,714 --> 00:24:33,883
Any sign of what might've happened?
How she got here?

192
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:36,968
That's the $64 million question,
isn't it?

193
00:24:37,218 --> 00:24:40,095
Ever hear of a ship called
the "Marie Celeste"?

194
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:45,223
Twin-masted brigantine out of
Charleston during the Civil War.

195
00:24:45,473 --> 00:24:48,726
She was bound for London
with a cargo of cotton.

196
00:24:48,976 --> 00:24:49,816
Thanks.

197
00:24:51,477 --> 00:24:55,897
Two months after she set sail, she was
sighted by fishermen off Tripoli.

198
00:24:56,147 --> 00:24:59,857
She was doing 12 knots an hour
in a stiff breeze.

199
00:25:00,108 --> 00:25:06,570
Something wasn't quite right. They
didn't know what so they went onboard.

200
00:25:06,821 --> 00:25:10,532
You know what they found?

201
00:25:12,158 --> 00:25:13,741
Nothing.

202
00:25:13,991 --> 00:25:18,453
No passengers. No crew. No captain.

203
00:25:18,704 --> 00:25:20,830
No sign of distress.

204
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:27,292
59 days after the last log entry, it had
traveled 4500 miles across the ocean...

205
00:25:27,543 --> 00:25:35,214
...past the Rock of Gibraltar and into
the Mediterranean Sea at full sail.

206
00:25:35,214 --> 00:25:37,632
And nobody at the helm.

207
00:25:37,882 --> 00:25:42,177
- What do you make of that?
- A ghost ship.

208
00:25:42,552 --> 00:25:48,347
Hey, you smell that?
I smell bullshit.

209
00:25:49,974 --> 00:25:52,851
- Been on the sea a lot longer than you.
- I know.

210
00:25:53,101 --> 00:25:57,603
Seen things that
you can't even imagine.

211
00:25:57,854 --> 00:26:02,606
<i>Maritime history is full of
Marie Celestes.</i>

212
00:26:02,857 --> 00:26:05,443
So, what's our plan?

213
00:26:05,693 --> 00:26:09,445
I think we should do what we came
to do. Tie her up, tug her in.

214
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:15,116
You think our little tug
will pull this entire ocean liner?

215
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:17,283
Not with the problems we got.

216
00:26:17,533 --> 00:26:21,661
We could set her at anchor
and come back with two or three tugs.

217
00:26:21,911 --> 00:26:24,496
No, some Russian trawler
will come along.

218
00:26:24,747 --> 00:26:28,666
I've already looked for her anchors,
anyway. They're gone.

219
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:31,834
- What do you think?
- Get the engines working...

220
00:26:32,084 --> 00:26:36,212
...it could take us two weeks
minimum to tow a vessel this size.

221
00:26:36,463 --> 00:26:42,300
For my share of what she's worth,
I'd drag her back to Anchorage myself.

222
00:26:52,431 --> 00:26:54,224
Don't let go!

223
00:26:54,474 --> 00:26:55,574
Help me! Don't let go!

224
00:27:00,978 --> 00:27:06,774
- Thought you might want a jacket.
- Thanks.

225
00:27:17,156 --> 00:27:18,531
Boy, do I miss that.

226
00:27:18,782 --> 00:27:24,285
You okay? You seem quiet
since you came back.

227
00:27:25,536 --> 00:27:29,997
I think I saw something
I couldn't possibly have seen.

228
00:27:30,247 --> 00:27:32,541
- Like what?
- No, it's crazy.

229
00:27:32,792 --> 00:27:36,543
I'm curious. Tell me.

230
00:27:40,838 --> 00:27:43,339
I think I saw a little girl.

231
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:45,800
On...

232
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:49,259
On the... The boat?

233
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:54,305
Yeah. Looking right at me.

234
00:27:54,555 --> 00:27:56,515
And then what happened?

235
00:27:56,765 --> 00:27:59,308
Nothing. She disappeared.

236
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:04,061
Sometimes, when I'd be flying
for hours on end...

237
00:28:04,311 --> 00:28:07,605
...I'd think I'd see stuff too.

238
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:13,693
It'd be there one second
and gone the next. Like a dream.

239
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,236
Thanks.

240
00:28:17,486 --> 00:28:20,948
- See you in the a. m.
- Okay.

241
00:28:21,197 --> 00:28:24,366
Good night.

242
00:28:25,325 --> 00:28:30,204
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

243
00:28:51,217 --> 00:28:55,553
She's got a big hole.
She's sinking.

244
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:01,015
- This is where the damage is. See?
- Breach in the hull, about 10 by 20...

245
00:29:01,265 --> 00:29:06,184
...torn to the port collision bulkhead.
- Did it hit an iceberg?

246
00:29:06,435 --> 00:29:10,187
No, you don't need an iceberg
to rupture a hull.

247
00:29:10,438 --> 00:29:13,856
- She's been hit recently.
- About a week ago, I'd say.

248
00:29:14,106 --> 00:29:15,608
This is where we are.

249
00:29:15,858 --> 00:29:19,402
The problem's this group of islands.
Nothing spectacular...

250
00:29:19,652 --> 00:29:21,945
...just rocks,
a couple thousand seals.

251
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:25,990
The "Antonia Graza"'s caught here
in this strong current loop...

252
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,618
...and slowly she's been pushed towards
those rocks. Last time she hit them.

253
00:29:30,868 --> 00:29:33,369
- What about next time?
- Won't be one.

254
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,497
We've got three days to fix it.
That's if the weather holds.

255
00:29:37,748 --> 00:29:39,624
Why can't we tow it like it is?

256
00:29:39,874 --> 00:29:42,958
It'd be like towing a car
with four flat tires.

257
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:50,088
- It's a bump in the road. We can fix it.
- Murph, bump in the road?

258
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:54,216
The breach we can probably patch
if we can get to the inside.

259
00:29:54,467 --> 00:29:59,887
We'll weld shut the flooded compartments,
pump out the water up to the aft peak.

260
00:30:00,137 --> 00:30:02,971
On top of that, the rudder's jammed.

261
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:07,808
We jerry-rig it, set a 38-degree
current drift to clear the island chain.

262
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:10,894
What does all that mean?

263
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:14,271
I just... That's a lot
of work for three days.

264
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:18,815
But with the gear we've got onboard
and what's on that ship, we can try.

265
00:30:19,066 --> 00:30:21,317
We can do it, right?

266
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:25,278
With the gear we've got onboard,
I can't fix our engine.

267
00:30:25,528 --> 00:30:28,572
Quit bitching and overhaul
the starboard engine.

268
00:30:28,822 --> 00:30:32,824
- So that's the plan?
- Just do it.

269
00:30:36,285 --> 00:30:39,621
- I'll call it in.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

270
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,248
- Maritime law states...
- I know.

271
00:30:42,498 --> 00:30:48,710
We just don't want any
unexpected guests. Just leave it.

272
00:30:48,961 --> 00:30:51,587
Your call, captain.

273
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,300
All right, you know the drill.
We do a complete recon.

274
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:01,969
Make sure we've got no problems
before we get to work.

275
00:31:02,219 --> 00:31:04,845
- Stay with me, Greer. Don't wander.
- Okay.

276
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:07,597
Dodge, Munder, go to the port
collision bulkhead.

277
00:31:07,847 --> 00:31:11,433
Jack and I'll work back from the fore.
Call if you need anything.

278
00:31:11,684 --> 00:31:15,018
- How about a pizza?
- You're so funny.

279
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:20,022
The only plan in this business is that
there is no plan. What is that?

280
00:31:20,273 --> 00:31:27,319
What these people talking crazy for?
That's not even good English.

281
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,194
Hang in there, okay, "preciosa"?

282
00:31:29,444 --> 00:31:34,699
Because someday he'll find
some other genius to fix his boat.

283
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:40,327
You want to play like that?

284
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,495
It's still sweet, though.

285
00:31:43,745 --> 00:31:47,457
Light coming up.

286
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:56,504
You were right. She is beautiful.

287
00:31:56,754 --> 00:31:59,381
She sure is.

288
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:44,745
Epps, we're heading for
the main engine room. Epps?

289
00:33:07,634 --> 00:33:11,637
All right, "capitano".

290
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,386
Oh, shit.

291
00:35:18,636 --> 00:35:22,722
We're gonna have to dive
to get to that tear.

292
00:35:22,972 --> 00:35:27,934
Epps, the engine room
is totally flooded.

293
00:35:27,934 --> 00:35:31,936
Epps, can you hear me?

294
00:35:37,315 --> 00:35:38,565
Wait!

295
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:43,651
What happened? You okay?

296
00:35:43,902 --> 00:35:49,198
What are you doing down there?
Did you hurt yourself?

297
00:36:25,221 --> 00:36:28,723
What are you doing?

298
00:36:30,934 --> 00:36:34,060
The whole bottom's riddled with them.

299
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,770
Looks like someone
used it for target practice.

300
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,481
- That's the happy version.
- What's the not-so-happy version?

301
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:43,316
There were people in there.

302
00:36:43,566 --> 00:36:45,527
I saw that little girl again.

303
00:36:45,776 --> 00:36:47,216
What? Where?

304
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:54,031
- I must be losing my goddamn mind.
- Well, did she say anything?

305
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:58,493
Forget it. Come on.

306
00:37:23,676 --> 00:37:26,094
Murphy, come in.

307
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:30,012
Dodge! Anybody!

308
00:37:30,263 --> 00:37:31,513
Shit.

309
00:37:35,308 --> 00:37:39,185
I think she's fucking with us.

310
00:38:21,589 --> 00:38:25,883
Looks like central laundry.

311
00:38:29,343 --> 00:38:34,138
This vent connects to the forward hold.
We need to see if it's flooded.

312
00:38:34,388 --> 00:38:39,350
- I may need help shutting it.
- You sure we need to...?

313
00:38:55,735 --> 00:38:58,237
Murphy, where the hell are you?

314
00:38:58,488 --> 00:39:01,822
- How long have they been here?
- A month, maybe less.

315
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:05,158
- What are we gonna do?
- Get off this boat!

316
00:39:05,408 --> 00:39:07,744
- But the ship...
- If it sinks, it sinks.

317
00:39:07,994 --> 00:39:09,994
You're right.

318
00:39:10,244 --> 00:39:11,084
Stinks.

319
00:39:14,165 --> 00:39:16,499
- What the hell?
- We came through there.

320
00:39:16,749 --> 00:39:17,709
No shit!

321
00:39:22,169 --> 00:39:23,129
Come on!

322
00:39:27,423 --> 00:39:31,717
This way. Come on, Jack.

323
00:39:47,019 --> 00:39:49,896
What the...?

324
00:39:55,733 --> 00:39:59,151
When'd you start
wearing lipstick, Epps?

325
00:39:59,402 --> 00:40:00,652
Epps?

326
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:07,366
"Francesca. "

327
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:09,867
Nice titties.

328
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:16,914
Not that you can hold a candle
to the future Mrs. Greer, though.

329
00:40:28,087 --> 00:40:34,925
Come on, Jack. Stop dragging ass!
What's your problem?

330
00:40:38,761 --> 00:40:40,512
What's this?

331
00:40:40,762 --> 00:40:45,481
Forget it. Let's go! Jack!

332
00:40:45,481 --> 00:40:49,309
'58 Jaguar X150. I've dreamt
about this car since I was a kid.

333
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:55,439
We have to get out of here now.
Do you understand? Now.

334
00:41:00,775 --> 00:41:05,653
There's something moving in there.

335
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,248
Fuck!

336
00:41:22,498 --> 00:41:26,625
Oh, my God!
I hate rats!

337
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,877
What?

338
00:41:30,127 --> 00:41:33,255
Oh, my God! Look at this!

339
00:41:33,505 --> 00:41:35,173
I have to get Murphy.

340
00:41:35,423 --> 00:41:36,263
Murphy!

341
00:41:43,762 --> 00:41:45,721
Is someone trying to call me?

342
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:48,639
Dodge! Munder!

343
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:51,391
<i>Maureen...</i>

344
00:41:51,641 --> 00:41:53,726
Who's Maureen?

345
00:41:53,976 --> 00:41:57,813
It's my first name.

346
00:41:58,104 --> 00:42:01,398
<i>- It's cold...
- He said "cold"?</i>

347
00:42:01,648 --> 00:42:05,150
The galley.

348
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:17,659
<i>- It's cold.
- Please help us.</i>

349
00:42:21,495 --> 00:42:25,039
Don't go in there.

350
00:43:01,937 --> 00:43:06,023
You fucking assholes!
Fuck you!

351
00:43:06,273 --> 00:43:08,109
Take it easy!

352
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:12,569
You were fucking with us. We fucked
with you. Why aren't you laughing?

353
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:17,364
Wanna hear something funnier? We
found dead guys in the laundry room.

354
00:43:17,614 --> 00:43:22,785
And this in the cargo hold.

355
00:43:34,001 --> 00:43:37,127
Need some help, skipper?

356
00:43:40,379 --> 00:43:43,007
I'm sorry.

357
00:43:59,308 --> 00:44:00,976
- Jesus.
- Oh, man.

358
00:44:01,226 --> 00:44:02,426
Holy shit!

359
00:44:07,814 --> 00:44:09,064
Yeah!

360
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:13,233
We're rich!

361
00:44:13,483 --> 00:44:18,029
- You son of a bitch!
- Rich!

362
00:44:20,447 --> 00:44:23,824
- Come on. Let's go.
- Move this shit out!

363
00:44:24,074 --> 00:44:27,826
One. Two. Three...

364
00:44:43,879 --> 00:44:46,380
How much you figure it's worth, boss?

365
00:44:46,631 --> 00:44:51,759
There's a lot of gold. Hard to know.
Two, 300 million, maybe. Maybe more.

366
00:44:52,009 --> 00:44:53,719
- Jesus.
- I don't know.

367
00:44:53,969 --> 00:44:57,304
Lock boxes with half of Fort Knox
in them? They gotta be insured.

368
00:44:57,554 --> 00:45:00,973
No way somebody will let
this much gold float away.

369
00:45:01,223 --> 00:45:04,601
Well, the markings have been
filed down.

370
00:45:04,851 --> 00:45:09,854
- What does that mean?
- Someone didn't want this traceable.

371
00:45:10,104 --> 00:45:11,146
It's stolen.

372
00:45:11,396 --> 00:45:16,025
It may have to do with the reason
this ship disappeared when it did.

373
00:45:16,274 --> 00:45:19,653
Wait. If the gold's got
something to do with 1962...

374
00:45:19,903 --> 00:45:24,280
...what about the bodies? They can't be
more than three weeks old.

375
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:29,284
Somebody's gotta say it, and it might as
well be me. This ship is fucked up.

376
00:45:29,534 --> 00:45:34,703
Earlier I could swear I heard
a woman singing. It's like she was...

377
00:45:34,954 --> 00:45:39,123
- Like she was coming on to me.
- Oh, no!

378
00:45:42,042 --> 00:45:45,001
It was the sexiest voice
I ever heard, man.

379
00:45:45,252 --> 00:45:51,423
- She got any backup singers?
- Whatever you're on, get me some!

380
00:45:51,673 --> 00:45:55,634
Maybe you're not quite
ready to get married, Greer.

381
00:45:55,884 --> 00:45:57,511
- Fuck you.
- Okay, guys.

382
00:45:57,761 --> 00:46:00,428
- What about the Coast Guard?
- No.

383
00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:06,808
You call the Coast Guard... What if
the gold did turn out to be stolen?

384
00:46:07,934 --> 00:46:11,812
Under maritime law, anything
found in international waters...

385
00:46:12,062 --> 00:46:15,689
...belongs to the finder. Okay?
That is the law.

386
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,524
- Right.
- Finders keepers.

387
00:46:18,774 --> 00:46:21,567
If we're gonna do this,
I say we do it now.

388
00:46:21,818 --> 00:46:26,029
Get our boat going, grab the gold
and get the hell out of here.

389
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,614
We leave the boat, take the gold.
Who's with me?

390
00:46:29,864 --> 00:46:33,367
I'm with the gold, man.

391
00:46:33,617 --> 00:46:35,410
Gold.

392
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,740
The gold.

393
00:46:41,123 --> 00:46:44,291
- Epps?
- I just want to get off this boat.

394
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:47,960
Okay. Let's go to work.

395
00:46:48,252 --> 00:46:54,715
<i>Okay. "Warrior" is in position, Murph.
Can we please get the hell out of here?</i>

396
00:46:54,715 --> 00:46:59,634
Yeah, "preciosa"! Smell that money!
100 million. You hear what I'm saying?

397
00:46:59,884 --> 00:47:03,177
100 million!

398
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,804
Greer? Get those engines going.

399
00:47:06,054 --> 00:47:07,848
<i>I'm bringing the gold down.</i>

400
00:47:08,098 --> 00:47:10,391
Yes, sir, captain, sir.

401
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:15,895
<i>Hey, Santos. Hurry your ass up, "vato".
We almost got the gold.</i>

402
00:47:16,145 --> 00:47:21,648
I wanna see these gauges rocking,
because you just had an overhaul.

403
00:47:21,899 --> 00:47:26,151
And you, I want you
to give me some too.

404
00:47:29,237 --> 00:47:31,946
Let's do this!

405
00:47:32,196 --> 00:47:34,449
<i>Hey, yo, Greer! Fire it up!</i>

406
00:47:34,698 --> 00:47:39,576
We're going to haul ass.
Bring it on! We'll be so fucking rich!

407
00:47:39,826 --> 00:47:41,786
Stop!

408
00:47:42,037 --> 00:47:45,246
Stop! You don't know
what you're doing!

409
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:48,708
We're good to go, skipper.

410
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:54,711
Don't start the boats! He'll...

411
00:47:54,711 --> 00:47:56,504
Shit!

412
00:47:56,755 --> 00:47:57,475
Greer!

413
00:48:01,674 --> 00:48:04,760
Greer! What the hell just happened?

414
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:09,429
Jesus Christ! Fire on deck!

415
00:48:18,227 --> 00:48:23,146
Santos! Greer! Munder!

416
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,824
I got you.

417
00:48:40,075 --> 00:48:45,703
- Epps! I got Munder!
- Greer!

418
00:48:45,703 --> 00:48:48,247
Come on!

419
00:48:48,497 --> 00:48:54,125
Santos!
Santos, answer me!

420
00:49:13,429 --> 00:49:19,183
I don't know what happened.
The engine room just blew.

421
00:49:19,433 --> 00:49:23,395
Maybe Santos rushed the engines,
didn't seal up the gaskets right...

422
00:49:23,645 --> 00:49:28,523
Jack, did you find anything out about
this ship before you sent us out here?

423
00:49:28,773 --> 00:49:32,692
No, but I... Look, we've got
the gold, and we are still alive.

424
00:49:32,942 --> 00:49:35,569
- Tell that to Santos, asshole!
- Ease up!

425
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:37,571
This is bullshit!

426
00:49:37,821 --> 00:49:39,946
Santos came here out of free will...

427
00:49:40,196 --> 00:49:42,991
...just like us.
- What does that mean?

428
00:49:43,241 --> 00:49:45,366
- Enough!
- Santos is dead because of you!

429
00:49:45,616 --> 00:49:49,870
Come on! It's not gonna
bring him back.

430
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:12,802
Murph, it's not your fault.
You know that.

431
00:50:23,391 --> 00:50:24,591
How is he?

432
00:50:27,145 --> 00:50:32,148
Here's the plan. We're professional
salvors with a fortune onboard.

433
00:50:32,398 --> 00:50:35,566
I say we do what we do best:
Fix this rust bucket.

434
00:50:35,816 --> 00:50:38,318
Control her drift. Clear those islands.

435
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:41,070
We can survive long enough
to get picked up.

436
00:50:41,321 --> 00:50:44,280
Why is this a question?
We have the materials.

437
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:50,075
Why don't we build a raft and leave?
There is something wrong with this boat!

438
00:50:50,326 --> 00:50:53,745
- If we stay here, we may not survive.
- You want to build a raft?

439
00:50:53,995 --> 00:50:56,579
- I want to build a raft.
- Even with the "Warrior"...

440
00:50:56,829 --> 00:51:01,000
...we were stretching to do this
in three days. We can't do this.

441
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:03,667
You're the best spot-welder I know.

442
00:51:03,918 --> 00:51:07,378
We can do it right now,
but I need you.

443
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:14,300
Fine. But there's no way we're doing
a major patch-and-pump in the dark.

444
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:16,927
Even with the lights we have,
it'd be like going in blind.

445
00:51:17,177 --> 00:51:22,263
Okay, fine. We'll chill tonight
and go in the a. m.

446
00:51:24,057 --> 00:51:26,307
Greer? What do you say?

447
00:51:26,557 --> 00:51:30,393
Now you want to know what
the first mate has to say?

448
00:51:30,644 --> 00:51:34,855
I say go to hell, Epps. You're not
qualified to get us off this ship.

449
00:51:35,104 --> 00:51:38,316
Had Murphy let me do it my way,
we wouldn't be in this.

450
00:51:38,566 --> 00:51:42,485
- And the Coast Guard...
- So it's everybody else's fault, right?

451
00:51:42,735 --> 00:51:45,945
They'd be here and we'd
be on our way home, millionaires.

452
00:51:46,195 --> 00:51:48,322
That's bullshit.

453
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:51,539
Grow up, asshole.

454
00:51:51,539 --> 00:51:55,868
Fucking bitch! Keep fucking talking.
Say another word!

455
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,912
Say another word!

456
00:52:48,653 --> 00:52:51,488
Here it is. Katie. B-deck.

457
00:52:51,738 --> 00:52:54,699
You were alone.

458
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:00,911
<i>100-to-1, somebody poisoned
the passengers to get the gold.</i>

459
00:53:01,162 --> 00:53:04,913
<i>Okay, Sherlock, if they were poisoned,
why are these cans safe?</i>

460
00:53:05,164 --> 00:53:09,083
They're still sealed.
It's been sealed for 40 years. It's safe.

461
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:14,086
Okay, shoot for it. Loser goes first.

462
00:53:14,545 --> 00:53:17,547
- Paper beats rock.
- Come on, man, best of three.

463
00:53:17,796 --> 00:53:20,798
- Bullshit. You lost.
- Where's your empathy?

464
00:53:21,048 --> 00:53:27,011
Winners do not empathize
with losers. Bon appétit.

465
00:53:35,183 --> 00:53:37,268
I screwed up.

466
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:39,436
I should've called it in.

467
00:53:39,686 --> 00:53:43,856
Damn! I knew better!

468
00:53:44,106 --> 00:53:48,692
I'll make it home to you, baby.
I swear.

469
00:53:49,776 --> 00:53:53,361
What the hell are you looking at?

470
00:54:01,492 --> 00:54:03,243
- That's all right.
- No way.

471
00:54:03,494 --> 00:54:06,704
No, really. It's good.
Look, I'm not kidding.

472
00:54:06,954 --> 00:54:11,582
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious. It's good!

473
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:15,793
- You gotta try that!
- That's good!

474
00:54:16,043 --> 00:54:18,212
That's great!

475
00:54:18,461 --> 00:54:19,181
Katie?

476
00:54:27,259 --> 00:54:27,979
Katie?

477
00:54:49,565 --> 00:54:51,733
Can I tell you something else?
We get back...

478
00:54:51,983 --> 00:54:57,569
...I'm gonna take my money
and I'm gonna buy you a bathtub.

479
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:02,031
I'll get you a lifetime supply
of titty magazines and toilet paper!

480
00:55:02,281 --> 00:55:06,326
I already beat you to it, bro!

481
00:55:10,121 --> 00:55:13,288
There's something on your...

482
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,520
Katie?

483
00:58:37,422 --> 00:58:38,382
Who, me?

484
00:58:44,759 --> 00:58:48,637
Francesca, I know
all of this isn't real.

485
00:58:48,887 --> 00:58:53,515
So I'm just gonna go with it, okay?

486
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:59,978
Can't cheat on your fiancée
with a dead girl, right?

487
00:59:26,328 --> 00:59:27,768
Her parents.

488
00:59:31,498 --> 00:59:32,338
Please.

489
00:59:35,376 --> 00:59:39,296
Don't close it.

490
00:59:41,046 --> 00:59:44,883
Haven't seen them for years.

491
00:59:45,133 --> 00:59:47,800
They moved to New York.

492
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:52,346
I was on my way to join them.

493
00:59:52,638 --> 00:59:55,597
But they're dead now.

494
00:59:56,348 --> 00:59:58,975
- How would you know?
- When you're like this...

495
00:59:59,225 --> 01:00:02,602
...you know these things.

496
01:00:02,935 --> 01:00:06,104
My mother...

497
01:00:06,104 --> 01:00:09,314
...she made me this dress.

498
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:12,275
Do you like it?

499
01:00:16,027 --> 01:00:19,738
You remind me of her.

500
01:00:19,738 --> 01:00:23,574
I don't think so.

501
01:00:24,741 --> 01:00:29,703
Well, here. You should have this back.

502
01:00:34,873 --> 01:00:39,751
Oh, God, you really are
a fucking ghost.

503
01:00:43,045 --> 01:00:46,714
Where are you going?

504
01:00:58,471 --> 01:01:04,309
Santos was my goddamn responsibility.

505
01:01:15,775 --> 01:01:19,986
- The "Lorelei".
- She was adrift. We rescued her.

506
01:01:20,236 --> 01:01:24,948
I've heard the story of the "Lorelei".

507
01:01:24,948 --> 01:01:29,575
I didn't know the "Graza" was involved.

508
01:01:30,576 --> 01:01:34,620
The gold was onboard the "Lorelei"?

509
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:40,458
It says here "May 19, 1962".

510
01:01:40,707 --> 01:01:45,794
That's two days before
your ship disappeared.

511
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:51,548
There were no survivors
onboard the "Lorelei".

512
01:01:57,635 --> 01:02:00,470
Jesus Christ!

513
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:07,767
Where you going?

514
01:02:26,529 --> 01:02:29,781
Most spirits are free
to be with their families.

515
01:02:30,032 --> 01:02:34,492
So why aren't you with yours?

516
01:02:36,328 --> 01:02:40,747
- We're all trapped here.
- Who?

517
01:02:40,997 --> 01:02:43,582
My shipmates and I.

518
01:02:43,832 --> 01:02:46,584
Even the ones who aren't marked.

519
01:02:46,834 --> 01:02:48,084
Marked?

520
01:02:48,335 --> 01:02:50,420
Katie, what do you mean?

521
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:54,005
When the boat's full...

522
01:02:54,255 --> 01:02:56,549
What? You can tell me.

523
01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:03,220
When he has all the souls he needs
and has filled his quota...

524
01:03:03,637 --> 01:03:06,513
...we'll all be ferried...

525
01:03:06,764 --> 01:03:09,265
...to...

526
01:03:09,515 --> 01:03:12,725
What is it? What's wrong?

527
01:03:13,351 --> 01:03:16,604
- What is it?
- He doesn't want me talking to you.

528
01:03:16,853 --> 01:03:19,481
- He who?
- But I'm not like the others!

529
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:21,315
You need to tell me.

530
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:25,818
You must go at once.
Leave the ship while you still can!

531
01:03:26,069 --> 01:03:29,445
Katie, what is it?

532
01:03:29,654 --> 01:03:31,214
Katie! Katie?

533
01:03:34,698 --> 01:03:36,866
Epps?

534
01:03:37,116 --> 01:03:39,077
Come on!

535
01:03:39,327 --> 01:03:42,370
We have to leave.

536
01:03:43,621 --> 01:03:46,957
Where you going, Murphy?

537
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:51,960
What's the matter? It's me.

538
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:53,878
Santos.

539
01:03:54,128 --> 01:03:59,131
It's no fun lying
at the bottom of the ocean.

540
01:04:01,216 --> 01:04:05,969
No lights at the end of the tunnel.
Not for me, Murph.

541
01:04:06,219 --> 01:04:10,555
No 10,000 virgins at the pearly gates.

542
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:15,725
Because of the plan, I'm trapped
on this dreamboat of yours.

543
01:04:15,976 --> 01:04:21,938
So you know what?
You're coming along for the ride.

544
01:04:42,785 --> 01:04:43,535
No!

545
01:04:52,791 --> 01:04:53,631
Murphy?

546
01:05:05,258 --> 01:05:09,010
You all right, Murph?

547
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:12,637
You okay?

548
01:05:15,264 --> 01:05:19,017
- What's the matter, Murph?
- It's me!

549
01:05:24,604 --> 01:05:30,149
- It's me!
- Do it, come on. It'll make you feel good.

550
01:05:36,111 --> 01:05:38,654
Come on!

551
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:47,952
- Come on!
- Hey!

552
01:05:54,081 --> 01:05:58,667
Oh, God.
Epps, you okay?

553
01:06:01,669 --> 01:06:05,213
- Keep him in the aquarium.
- No, listen. He was drunk.

554
01:06:05,463 --> 01:06:08,257
He didn't know what he was doing.

555
01:06:08,508 --> 01:06:13,093
Look, he just tried to kill you.
He stays in there.

556
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:17,387
Let's go find Greer.

557
01:06:27,019 --> 01:06:29,229
Any sign of him?

558
01:06:29,479 --> 01:06:30,896
No, we looked all over.

559
01:06:31,146 --> 01:06:34,690
Man's pissed off.
Seems to happen on this boat.

560
01:06:34,941 --> 01:06:38,276
- Least we weren't around 40 years ago.
- The passengers were poisoned...

561
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:42,696
...to get to the gold? Isn't that...?
- Extreme? Maybe, but if the shoe fits...

562
01:06:42,947 --> 01:06:45,948
Next thing you know,
we'll be trying to kill each other.

563
01:06:46,198 --> 01:06:50,117
- What's with the heart?
- Found it. Belonged to this little girl.

564
01:06:50,368 --> 01:06:53,869
- What girl?
- She told me to get off this boat.

565
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:57,581
- She's talking to you now?
- What are you talking about?

566
01:06:57,832 --> 01:07:01,124
- You're seeing ghosts, Epps?
- Just forget it.

567
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:03,334
So the ship's got a few kinks.

568
01:07:03,584 --> 01:07:07,586
Let's stick with Munder's specs
and try to fix the ship.

569
01:07:07,837 --> 01:07:11,090
No way five people and the gold
will fit on any raft.

570
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:14,800
Murphy's not going anywhere,
and we're not leaving him here.

571
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:20,637
We stick with the plan. Fix the boat.
Let's get going. Come on.

572
01:07:29,601 --> 01:07:32,270
<i>That's the collision bulkhead hatch.</i>

573
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:36,022
<i>- Wheel's busted. It won't open.
- Arming the C4.</i>

574
01:07:36,273 --> 01:07:37,273
<i>- Dodge?
- I'm good.</i>

575
01:07:37,523 --> 01:07:38,858
<i>- Munder?
- I'm good.</i>

576
01:07:39,108 --> 01:07:40,068
<i>Contact.</i>

577
01:07:45,237 --> 01:07:48,822
<i>- There's the tear, portside.
- Looks bigger from here.</i>

578
01:07:49,072 --> 01:07:53,242
<i>- I'll shut her up.
- No problem.</i>

579
01:07:54,326 --> 01:08:00,247
<i>- Munder, rudder's fixed. You all right?
- I'm good.</i>

580
01:08:00,496 --> 01:08:05,291
<i>- What do you think, Dodge?
- She'll hold.</i>

581
01:08:07,084 --> 01:08:11,086
<i>- We're set with the pumps.
- Start them up.</i>

582
01:08:11,336 --> 01:08:14,298
Copy that, Epps.
One and two, kicking in.

583
01:08:14,548 --> 01:08:18,091
- I give it 12 hours till she's bone-dry.
- Both on full.

584
01:08:18,341 --> 01:08:21,385
<i>Get ready, Epps. Here it comes.</i>

585
01:08:21,635 --> 01:08:24,511
<i>Great work, guys.</i>

586
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:46,026
Damn. Current's faster than I thought.

587
01:08:46,443 --> 01:08:52,697
If we control her drift, headed in this
direction, we should clear those islands.

588
01:08:52,947 --> 01:08:55,783
We'll keep it afloat
until we get picked up.

589
01:08:56,033 --> 01:08:59,202
Son of a bitch.
We may just get out of this yet.

590
01:08:59,452 --> 01:09:00,577
Kazillionaires.

591
01:09:00,827 --> 01:09:03,537
Check on the bridge
when you're done here.

592
01:09:03,788 --> 01:09:07,873
I'll see if I can find Greer
down below.

593
01:09:10,918 --> 01:09:11,638
Greer?

594
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:30,191
Katie?

595
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:47,566
Greer? Jesus!

596
01:09:53,695 --> 01:09:56,279
- Shit.
- Number two's clogged. Who's going?

597
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:57,370
You go.

598
01:10:00,367 --> 01:10:03,952
Shit. Every single time!

599
01:10:05,577 --> 01:10:08,038
Oh, my God.

600
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:11,706
Come with me.

601
01:10:11,915 --> 01:10:15,459
I want to show you something.

602
01:14:36,796 --> 01:14:37,546
No!

603
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:41,007
Come on! No!

604
01:14:41,257 --> 01:14:42,217
Come on!

605
01:14:44,635 --> 01:14:49,471
You can't die on me!

606
01:15:42,172 --> 01:15:44,882
Dodge. Murphy's dead.

607
01:15:45,132 --> 01:15:47,467
- What?
- We have to get off this boat.

608
01:15:47,717 --> 01:15:51,803
There's a reason you, me and Munder are
still alive. That's why he came after us.

609
01:15:52,053 --> 01:15:57,556
- To fix his ship.
- I just saw Murphy. What's happening?

610
01:15:59,141 --> 01:16:02,310
I don't know.

611
01:16:02,978 --> 01:16:05,312
I want you and Dodge
on the rudder.

612
01:16:05,562 --> 01:16:08,064
- But you just said...
- Listen to me.

613
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:14,277
I'll get Munder, we'll see if the welds
are holding. Stay here till we get back.

614
01:16:14,527 --> 01:16:18,446
I do not want you out of
each other's sight. Take this.

615
01:16:18,696 --> 01:16:19,656
Take it.

616
01:16:22,657 --> 01:16:27,118
- Be careful down there.
- I will.

617
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:23,904
- That's it, then. We made it.
- For now.

618
01:17:24,155 --> 01:17:27,158
- I'll check on Epps.
- No, she said to wait here.

619
01:17:27,408 --> 01:17:32,410
- Yeah, but...
- Hey, she said to wait! So wait.

620
01:17:44,668 --> 01:17:46,295
You disgust me.

621
01:17:46,545 --> 01:17:49,255
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

622
01:17:49,505 --> 01:17:53,507
You're a pathetic excuse for a man.
She says, "Jump", and you jump.

623
01:17:53,758 --> 01:17:58,469
You're disgusting.
I don't have time for this.

624
01:18:02,847 --> 01:18:07,475
- Who the hell are you?
- The question is, who are you?

625
01:18:07,725 --> 01:18:11,019
You worship her, yet you've
never had the balls to tell her...

626
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:14,271
...because you're a weak,
cowardly child.

627
01:18:14,521 --> 01:18:21,651
However, if you'll kindly step out of
my way, I'll make your dream a reality.

628
01:18:21,901 --> 01:18:26,946
You know, Dodge, if you kill somebody,
you go to hell.

629
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:32,867
Well, you live for her.
You willing to die for her?

630
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:18,813
I shot Ferriman. He's dead.

631
01:19:19,063 --> 01:19:21,774
Yeah? Don't be so sure, Dodge.

632
01:19:22,024 --> 01:19:25,776
- What are you doing?
- Trip's over. I'm sinking the boat.

633
01:19:26,026 --> 01:19:28,570
- It's taken its last victim.
- That'll kill us.

634
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:31,446
- We'll have to take our chances.
- What about the gold?

635
01:19:31,697 --> 01:19:35,992
Fucking kidding? We're not getting the
gold off this boat. Nobody ever does.

636
01:19:36,242 --> 01:19:38,450
Wait, wait. Wait!

637
01:19:38,701 --> 01:19:42,370
That gold can give us everything
we ever wanted.

638
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:46,123
We could have our own boat.
The two of us.

639
01:19:46,373 --> 01:19:49,542
We could have a life together.
You and me.

640
01:19:49,792 --> 01:19:54,461
What are you talking about?
Dodge, we gotta get out of here. Now.

641
01:19:54,712 --> 01:19:58,797
Well, I can't let you do that.

642
01:20:04,886 --> 01:20:08,345
So that's it, huh?

643
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:11,264
All right. Okay.

644
01:20:11,514 --> 01:20:15,434
You win. All right.

645
01:20:16,767 --> 01:20:18,853
Fucking bitch!

646
01:20:19,061 --> 01:20:21,645
All right, you win! Go ahead, do it!

647
01:20:21,896 --> 01:20:24,148
Go ahead. Blow it up!

648
01:20:24,398 --> 01:20:27,316
Kill us all!

649
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:34,613
Hey, Dodge. Why haven't you
asked me where Munder is?

650
01:20:40,241 --> 01:20:44,328
Well, I suppose that's because...

651
01:20:44,578 --> 01:20:46,537
...I already know.

652
01:20:46,787 --> 01:20:50,372
- You won't pull that trigger, Maureen.
- Try me.

653
01:20:50,623 --> 01:20:55,417
Dodge made the same mistake.
He's dead.

654
01:20:55,918 --> 01:20:57,669
Katie told you, didn't she?

655
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:02,047
Souls without sin can't be marked.
Makes them tough to control.

656
01:21:02,297 --> 01:21:05,633
But as long as I keep the boat afloat,
we'll all go down together.

657
01:21:05,883 --> 01:21:09,259
- What the fuck are you?
- I'm a salvager.

658
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:14,347
Just like you.
You collect ships, I collect souls.

659
01:21:14,597 --> 01:21:18,099
And when I fill my quota,
I send a boatload home.

660
01:21:18,349 --> 01:21:22,061
This will make management happy.
You see, it's a job.

661
01:21:22,311 --> 01:21:24,853
Given to me after a lifetime of sin.

662
01:21:25,103 --> 01:21:31,024
So if I lose this ship, management won't
be happy, which is not a good thing.

663
01:21:31,274 --> 01:21:35,402
I'm not getting through to you.
I'm asking for an exchange.

664
01:21:35,653 --> 01:21:37,861
This ship for your life.

665
01:21:38,111 --> 01:21:40,280
I want my crew back.

666
01:21:40,531 --> 01:21:44,699
Sorry. Once a passenger's marked,
they're mine.

667
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:48,869
Then I guess it's over.

668
01:21:57,041 --> 01:22:00,794
All you had to do was fix the ship!

669
01:22:03,462 --> 01:22:06,297
I gave you a great opportunity.

670
01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:10,300
All you had to do was take it.

671
01:22:13,635 --> 01:22:17,972
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

672
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:44,648
Careful. Hang in there, ma'am.

673
01:26:09,872 --> 01:26:10,622
No!
