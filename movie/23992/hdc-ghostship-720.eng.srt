00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
幽灵船 Ghost Ship    

3
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:39,049
I can't hold her much longer.
She's taking on too much water.

4
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:43,546
-What is going on back there?
-Keep your pants on, Murphy.

5
00:05:48,062 --> 00:05:51,896
We blew the starboard engine.
Port engine's way too hot.

6
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:55,091
-Hold on.
-Shorten the tow or cut her loose.

7
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:56,258
Epps...

8
00:05:56,437 --> 00:06:00,339
...get off my damn tugboat.
We don't have much time.

9
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:04,705
Move it, Epps. If she sinks,
she 's taking us with her.

10
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:13,987
Got a punch in the port floater.

11
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:17,123
-Five minutes before she floods.
-Less than that!

12
00:06:17,324 --> 00:06:19,849
Get back here.
We're cutting her loose.

13
00:06:20,027 --> 00:06:22,587
-Cut her loose.
-That' s it. Get back here.

14
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:24,559
Come on! You heard the man!

15
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:29,601
T ook us three months to get her off
the bottom. I will not lose her now!

16
00:06:30,904 --> 00:06:33,873
Goddamn it, Epps!
You can't fix everything!

17
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,474
Christ!

18
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:45,751
-For the last time, get back here!
-She's taking on too much water!

19
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:52,716
Why do you always have to break
my balls? I said get back here!

20
00:06:56,163 --> 00:07:01,430
Do you want me to come down there
and kick your ass? Because I'll do it.

21
00:07:07,174 --> 00:07:11,440
Here's to the best damn
salvage crew in the business!

22
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:15,172
-We did it, guys!
-Yeah, look at that!

23
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:18,147
All right. Nice work.

24
00:07:19,687 --> 00:07:23,179
-Here's to the fucking sea!
-To the sea.

25
00:07:28,295 --> 00:07:29,523
To a job well done.

26
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:34,626
Mr. Murphy? I'm Jack Ferriman. I was
wondering if I could buy you a drink.

27
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:37,060
He doesn't drink.

28
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:43,504
Could I talk to you alone?

29
00:07:44,078 --> 00:07:47,844
You talk to me, you talk to my crew.
That's the way it is.

30
00:07:49,683 --> 00:07:54,211
I fly the Arctic Weather Patrol flights
out of Mackenzie Bay.

31
00:07:54,388 --> 00:07:59,223
Last month I was out in the middle
of the Strait when I came across this.

32
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:03,187
Congratulations. You found a boat.

33
00:08:03,797 --> 00:08:06,561
In the middle of the ocean,
of all places.

34
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:10,464
I tried for radio contact
and got nothing...

35
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:13,663
...so I figured she had to be adrift.

36
00:08:13,874 --> 00:08:15,398
In the Bering Strait?

37
00:08:15,609 --> 00:08:19,045
That's miles from shipping lanes.
Did you alert the Coast Guard?

38
00:08:19,213 --> 00:08:23,206
It's international waters,
so they noted it and that's it.

39
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:24,850
You get a name?

40
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:29,455
No, I put it out of my head until
two days ago when I saw it again.

41
00:08:29,623 --> 00:08:32,990
What are we talking about?
What kind of tonnage?

42
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:37,323
Big. Huge.
Could be military.

43
00:08:37,498 --> 00:08:41,195
Let's say that we're
a little bit interested.

44
00:08:41,402 --> 00:08:43,336
What's in it for you?

45
00:08:43,904 --> 00:08:47,396
I want 20% finder's fee,
whatever she's worth.

46
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:52,209
-Have you told anyone else about this?
-Not a living soul.

47
00:08:54,815 --> 00:08:58,444
-Give us a minute, will you?
-Okay.

48
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:02,221
So? What do you think, Murph?

49
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:04,919
Who knows? Could be full of shit.

50
00:09:05,793 --> 00:09:10,059
I do know one thing. I've seen strange
things happen in the Strait.

51
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,360
I know something else:
Sea gives you an opportunity, take it.

52
00:09:14,535 --> 00:09:19,598
That's at least a week out of our way.
We've been out for six months already.

53
00:09:19,773 --> 00:09:24,142
I got a fiancee waiting, remember?
I'm getting married in a month.

54
00:09:24,311 --> 00:09:28,509
Plan was to go back to Anchorage.
Starboard diesel needs an overhaul.

55
00:09:28,682 --> 00:09:33,119
-ln our business, the only plan is:
-There is no plan.

56
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:38,384
If you don't want to go, that's fine.
Let's tell him we'll get somebody else.

57
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:44,258
Wait a minute. Let's not be hasty.
What's a ship like that worth?

58
00:09:44,965 --> 00:09:46,125
Who knows?

59
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,896
Millions? Thousands? Could be nothing.
Depends on a lot of things.

60
00:09:51,104 --> 00:09:54,938
-Mainly, if we have the right to salvage.
-Pretty big "if."

61
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:58,908
-What's the split?
-We split it even, six ways.

62
00:09:59,112 --> 00:10:02,639
-Even split?
-Beats me paying you overtime.

63
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,579
I'm good.

64
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,409
I'm in.

65
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:11,923
Greer? What do you say?

66
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:13,690
All right.

67
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,931
Hey, Ferriman! Can you come over here?

68
00:10:21,902 --> 00:10:26,805
So this is the way it works.
1 0% instead of your 20% finder's fee.

69
00:10:31,144 --> 00:10:34,773
I can't let you take advantage of me
like that.

70
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:37,746
That's the way it is.
Take it or leave it.

71
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:46,619
Fine. But I go with you.

72
00:10:48,295 --> 00:10:50,229
Not on my boat, you don't.

73
00:10:50,764 --> 00:10:54,894
Think I'd tell you where a fortune
might be without insurance?

74
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:58,162
There are five other boats
that would jump at this.

75
00:10:58,672 --> 00:11:01,664
I come with you.
So you take it or leave it.

76
00:11:34,174 --> 00:11:35,198
Things are dull!

77
00:11:39,112 --> 00:11:41,706
She'll love it. What do you think?

78
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:46,709
Too much off the sides, but I can
come up with something she'll love.

79
00:11:46,887 --> 00:11:50,084
-Shave that yourself.
-Don't want to help me out?

80
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:55,353
Who the fuck are you kidding? Everybody
knows you Navy boys take it up the ass.

81
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:17,875
-Enjoying the ride, Jack?
-No, sir.

82
00:12:31,932 --> 00:12:35,424
Not the same as flying planes
over ice sheets, is it?

83
00:12:35,602 --> 00:12:38,969
-What's the appeal?
-I could ask you the same thing.

84
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:43,734
What's a nice girl doing in a dump
like this instead of raising a family?

85
00:12:43,944 --> 00:12:47,607
I own a third of Murphy's operation.
I'm not that nice.

86
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:50,249
And these monkeys are my family.

87
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:53,783
Santos to Murphy. Come in.

88
00:12:57,891 --> 00:13:00,621
-Yeah?
-I think you should get up here.

89
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:04,262
-What is it?
-I think you should see this!

90
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:10,459
It was there a second ago!
Ten miles to the northwest.

91
00:13:10,637 --> 00:13:13,629
Would you turn off that fucking music?

92
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:18,102
I'm telling you, there must be a glitch.
I saw it with my own eyes.

93
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:22,042
-Glitch, my ass. There's nothing there.
-Give me a look at this.

94
00:13:24,084 --> 00:13:28,453
There it is! Right in front of you!
Tell me you don't see nothing.

95
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,917
Do you see what I'm saying?
Do you see what I'm saying to you?

96
00:13:35,195 --> 00:13:40,155
-Dodge, could you get on the bow light?
-All right, Murph.

97
00:13:45,338 --> 00:13:48,000
-It's there, right?
-There's something there.

98
00:13:55,882 --> 00:13:58,146
Hey, Murph, what's up?

99
00:14:00,387 --> 00:14:03,515
Vessel at position 7-5 north...

100
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,915
...this is Arctic Warrior.

101
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,194
Come in.

102
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,360
This is tugboat Arctic Warrior.
Do you read me?

103
00:14:16,303 --> 00:14:17,770
This is Arctic Warrior.

104
00:14:18,572 --> 00:14:20,199
Do you read me? Come in.

105
00:14:40,894 --> 00:14:42,122
Shit!

106
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:12,454
-Now do you believe me?
-Holy shit!

107
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,887
An ocean liner?
Where did that come from?

108
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:28,307
It's the Antonia Graza.

109
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,006
Jesus Christ.

110
00:15:31,745 --> 00:15:36,205
This is civilian tugboat Arctic Warrior.
Is there anyone aboard?

111
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:40,114
This is civilian tugboat Arctic Warrior.
Is there anyone aboard?

112
00:15:40,587 --> 00:15:44,318
This is Arctic Warrior.
Can you read us?

113
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:51,021
-You know her, Murphy?
-Only in my dreams.

114
00:15:57,904 --> 00:16:00,896
Christ, she' s beautiful.

115
00:16:01,842 --> 00:16:08,042
Italian liners couldn' t compete for speed,
so they built floating art palaces instead.

116
00:16:09,082 --> 00:16:13,519
She was reported missing May 21,
1 962, off the coast of Labrador.

117
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:18,783
Funny thing is, there was no distress
signal. She just disappeared.

118
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,957
Ever since, every captain's been looking
for her, hoping she hasn't gone down.

119
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,769
-Do you know what this means?
-What?

120
00:16:29,936 --> 00:16:35,067
Under the law of the sea, she's ours.
Let's not keep a lady waiting.

121
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:39,836
Santos, bring us alongside. Fire up
the crane. We got business to do.

122
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:46,246
When we get onboard, stay together. We
don't know what kind of shape she's in.

123
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:49,513
-Take us up, Greer.
-Aye, aye, captain.

124
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:55,225
Hey, Murphy, please remember to keep
all channels open. Thank you.

125
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:01,399
They won't let me go.

126
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:05,629
Safety first.
That's why you go last, Jack.

127
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,772
Can you sit down?
I'm trying to keep this steady.

128
00:17:08,975 --> 00:17:12,103
-I just want--
-Sit down! Get out of the way!

129
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:13,540
Okay.

130
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:20,919
She's had some battering over
the last 40 years, you can tell.

131
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:23,385
Stand by. Setting you down topside.

132
00:17:26,092 --> 00:17:28,287
She's still a beaut.

133
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:31,456
Unbelievable.

134
00:17:32,332 --> 00:17:35,130
You better stay alert. Watch your step.

135
00:17:35,302 --> 00:17:38,669
40 years of rust can turn
deck plates into quicksand.

136
00:17:38,838 --> 00:17:43,741
We'll make our way in at the fore,
then check the bridge. This way. Careful.

137
00:17:43,944 --> 00:17:48,108
-Forward mast is history.
-Epps and Murphy, are they a couple?

138
00:17:49,783 --> 00:17:54,152
Hell, no. She's like a daughter to him.
He'd be lost without her.

139
00:17:54,754 --> 00:17:58,417
Superstructure's in decent shape.
No sign of damage.

140
00:17:58,858 --> 00:18:04,956
-Lifeboats are gone, stern to bow.
-Life preserver lockers are all empty.

141
00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:08,594
Sure no survivors ever
turned up, Murph?

142
00:18:08,768 --> 00:18:12,033
Sure as we' re walking on
the Graza, Dodge. This way.

143
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:27,250
Let' s go.

144
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:40,423
Jesus. She' s no fiddler' s green.

145
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,698
You're wrong, Munder. She 's beautiful.

146
00:18:44,204 --> 00:18:47,435
Whoever was on here originally
sure left in a hurry.

147
00:18:50,777 --> 00:18:51,766
Murphy, come in.

148
00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:10,520
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome aboard. I' m Julie.

149
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,665
I'll be your hostess this evening.

150
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:19,700
Have some respect, okay?

151
00:19:28,314 --> 00:19:31,078
Check out all those champagne bottles.

152
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:34,015
Looks like we missed
one hell of a party.

153
00:19:34,187 --> 00:19:36,815
-And one hell of a hangover.
-Shut up!

154
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,819
-Shut up!
-Let's find the bridge.

155
00:20:07,987 --> 00:20:11,184
-Such a manly man.
-What?

156
00:20:11,591 --> 00:20:13,650
-You all right?
-Shut up!

157
00:20:13,827 --> 00:20:16,387
Come on, Mary, let's go.

158
00:20:21,801 --> 00:20:24,929
Murph, how many passengers
did she carry?

159
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:29,769
Over 600. The creme de la creme
of society from all over Europe.

160
00:20:29,943 --> 00:20:31,740
Crew of 500 from ltaly.

161
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:34,539
Talk to me. How's everything going?

162
00:20:41,187 --> 00:20:45,385
Okay, good. This companionway
should get us to the bridge.

163
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:48,327
Here, Epps, hold this.

164
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:08,843
What's going on?

165
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:12,515
-After you.
-No, after you.

166
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:15,745
No, no. After me.

167
00:21:16,222 --> 00:21:17,780
Tough guy.

168
00:21:32,238 --> 00:21:34,468
Don't let go!

169
00:21:35,608 --> 00:21:38,338
-Pull! Pull!
-Please, Epps!

170
00:21:41,781 --> 00:21:43,874
Please, Epps, don't let go!

171
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,643
-Give me your hand.
-Pull us up!

172
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,949
Oh, God!

173
00:21:57,397 --> 00:22:00,423
I told you to watch your fucking step!

174
00:22:03,436 --> 00:22:07,497
-Oh, shit. Oh, Jesus.
-From now on, you let me lead. Okay?

175
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:08,732
Let's go.

176
00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:14,409
-I think I just shit my pants.
-No, you always smell that way.

177
00:23:01,828 --> 00:23:04,058
Compass is dead.

178
00:23:09,636 --> 00:23:11,365
Helm's not responding, either.

179
00:23:11,904 --> 00:23:17,274
Fuel tanks are empty. She must've rode
on full throttle till she was bone-dry.

180
00:23:20,546 --> 00:23:22,138
Epps!

181
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:32,380
I'm looking for the ship's log.
Let's get this documentation back--

182
00:23:33,026 --> 00:23:35,256
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

183
00:23:35,828 --> 00:23:38,490
-You sure?
-Yeah.

184
00:23:39,032 --> 00:23:41,091
Let's get to it.

185
00:23:45,872 --> 00:23:47,601
Hey, check this out.

186
00:23:50,076 --> 00:23:54,911
-It's a watch. Congratulations, buddy.
-No. Look again, you moron.

187
00:23:55,114 --> 00:24:00,552
It's a digital watch. Do the math. They
didn't have digital watches in 1 962.

188
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,521
So we're not the first people to board
this ship. But she's ours now.

189
00:24:05,692 --> 00:24:11,722
Let's get some sleep, tow her at dawn.
Let's hope there's no more surprises.

190
00:24:11,898 --> 00:24:12,956
Amen to that.

191
00:24:18,304 --> 00:24:20,465
Oh, God.

192
00:24:25,244 --> 00:24:28,839
Epps, can I get some tea?

193
00:24:31,751 --> 00:24:35,653
Any sign of what might've happened?
How she got here?

194
00:24:36,189 --> 00:24:39,056
That's the $64 million question,
isn't it?

195
00:24:39,258 --> 00:24:42,227
Ever hear of a ship called
the Marie Celeste?

196
00:24:42,395 --> 00:24:46,889
Twin-masted brigantine out of
Charleston during the Civil War.

197
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,765
She was bound for London
with a cargo of cotton.

198
00:24:51,037 --> 00:24:52,026
Thanks.

199
00:24:53,506 --> 00:24:57,966
Two months after she set sail, she was
sighted by fishermen off Tripoli.

200
00:24:58,177 --> 00:25:01,408
She was doing 1 2 knots an hour
in a stiff breeze.

201
00:25:02,148 --> 00:25:08,087
Something wasn't quite right. They
didn't know what so they went onboard.

202
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:11,050
You know what they found?

203
00:25:14,193 --> 00:25:15,490
Nothing.

204
00:25:16,028 --> 00:25:19,589
No passengers. No crew. No captain.

205
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:22,394
No sign of distress.

206
00:25:23,136 --> 00:25:29,439
59 days after the last log entry, it had
traveled 4500 miles across the ocean...

207
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:35,741
...past the Rock of Gibraltar and into
the Mediterranean Sea at full sail.

208
00:25:37,316 --> 00:25:39,181
And nobody at the helm.

209
00:25:39,952 --> 00:25:42,682
-What do you make of that?
-A ghost ship.

210
00:25:44,624 --> 00:25:48,856
Hey, you smell that?
I smell bullshit.

211
00:25:52,031 --> 00:25:55,000
-Been on the sea a lot longer than you.
-I know.

212
00:25:55,168 --> 00:25:59,070
Seen things that
you can't even imagine.

213
00:25:59,939 --> 00:26:04,774
Maritime history is full of
Marie Celestes.

214
00:26:04,944 --> 00:26:07,572
So, what's our plan?

215
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,580
I think we should do what we came
to do. Tie her up, tug her in.

216
00:26:11,751 --> 00:26:15,983
You think our little tug
will pull this entire ocean liner?

217
00:26:17,423 --> 00:26:19,448
Not with the problems we got.

218
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:23,823
We could set her at anchor
and come back with two or three tugs.

219
00:26:23,996 --> 00:26:26,624
No, some Russian trawler
will come along.

220
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:30,826
I've already looked for her anchors,
anyway. They're gone.

221
00:26:31,003 --> 00:26:33,972
-What do you think?
-Get the engines working...

222
00:26:34,173 --> 00:26:38,337
...it could take us two weeks
minimum to tow a vessel this size.

223
00:26:38,544 --> 00:26:42,844
For my share of what she's worth,
I'd drag her back to Anchorage myself.

224
00:26:54,527 --> 00:26:56,358
Don't let go!

225
00:26:56,562 --> 00:27:01,295
Help me! Don't let go!

226
00:27:03,069 --> 00:27:07,301
-Thought you might want a jacket.
-Thanks.

227
00:27:19,252 --> 00:27:20,685
Boy, do I miss that.

228
00:27:20,887 --> 00:27:24,846
You okay? You seem quiet
since you came back.

229
00:27:27,627 --> 00:27:31,586
I think I saw something
I couldn't possibly have seen.

230
00:27:32,331 --> 00:27:34,697
-Like what?
-No, it's crazy.

231
00:27:34,901 --> 00:27:37,096
I'm curious. Tell me.

232
00:27:42,942 --> 00:27:45,536
I think I saw a little girl.

233
00:27:45,711 --> 00:27:47,975
On....

234
00:27:48,147 --> 00:27:50,377
On the.... The boat?

235
00:27:51,617 --> 00:27:55,314
Yeah. Looking right at me.

236
00:27:56,656 --> 00:27:58,715
And then what happened?

237
00:27:58,891 --> 00:28:01,485
Nothing. She disappeared.

238
00:28:01,661 --> 00:28:06,223
Sometimes, when I'd be flying
for hours on end...

239
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,630
...I'd think I'd see stuff too.

240
00:28:09,936 --> 00:28:14,202
It'd be there one second
and gone the next. Like a dream.

241
00:28:17,276 --> 00:28:19,210
Thanks.

242
00:28:19,545 --> 00:28:21,945
-See you in the a.m.
-Okay.

243
00:28:23,282 --> 00:28:24,874
Good night.

244
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,753
-See you tomorrow.
-Yeah.

245
00:28:53,312 --> 00:28:56,110
She's got a big hole.
She's sinking.

246
00:28:58,751 --> 00:29:03,188
-This is where the damage is. See?
-Breach in the hull, about 1 0 by 20...

247
00:29:03,356 --> 00:29:07,816
-...torn to the port collision bulkhead.
-Did it hit an iceberg?

248
00:29:08,527 --> 00:29:11,985
No, you don't need an iceberg
to rupture a hull.

249
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:15,989
-She's been hit recently.
-About a week ago, I'd say.

250
00:29:16,202 --> 00:29:17,726
This is where we are.

251
00:29:17,937 --> 00:29:21,566
The problem's this group of islands.
Nothing spectacular...

252
00:29:21,741 --> 00:29:24,107
...just rocks,
a couple thousand seals.

253
00:29:24,276 --> 00:29:28,144
The Antonia Graza's caught here
in this strong current loop...

254
00:29:28,347 --> 00:29:32,784
...and slowly she's been pushed towards
those rocks. Last time she hit them.

255
00:29:32,985 --> 00:29:35,545
-What about next time?
-Won't be one.

256
00:29:35,721 --> 00:29:39,521
We've got three days to fix it.
That's if the weather holds.

257
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:41,827
Why can't we tow it like it is?

258
00:29:41,994 --> 00:29:45,122
It'd be like towing a car
with four flat tires.

259
00:29:45,331 --> 00:29:50,667
-It's a bump in the road. We can fix it.
-Murph, bump in the road?

260
00:29:52,271 --> 00:29:56,037
The breach we can probably patch
if we can get to the inside.

261
00:29:56,575 --> 00:30:02,036
We'll weld shut the flooded compartments,
pump out the water up to the aft peak.

262
00:30:02,248 --> 00:30:05,149
On top of that, the rudder's jammed.

263
00:30:05,317 --> 00:30:10,016
We jerry-rig it, set a 38-degree
current drift to clear the island chain.

264
00:30:10,189 --> 00:30:13,090
What does all that mean?

265
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:16,456
I just-- That's a lot
of work for three days.

266
00:30:16,629 --> 00:30:21,032
But with the gear we've got onboard
and what's on that ship, we can try.

267
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,633
We can do it, right?

268
00:30:23,703 --> 00:30:27,434
With the gear we've got onboard,
I can't fix our engine.

269
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,768
Quit bitching and overhaul
the starboard engine.

270
00:30:30,943 --> 00:30:33,411
-So that's the plan?
-Just do it.

271
00:30:38,417 --> 00:30:41,818
-I'll call it in.
-I wouldn't do that if I were you.

272
00:30:41,987 --> 00:30:44,455
-Maritime law states--
-I know.

273
00:30:44,623 --> 00:30:50,528
We just don't want any
unexpected guests. Just leave it.

274
00:30:51,097 --> 00:30:52,155
Your call, captain.

275
00:30:57,002 --> 00:31:00,494
All right, you know the drill.
We do a complete recon.

276
00:31:00,673 --> 00:31:04,165
Make sure we've got no problems
before we get to work.

277
00:31:04,343 --> 00:31:07,073
-Stay with me, Greer. Don't wander.
-Okay.

278
00:31:07,246 --> 00:31:09,806
Dodge, Munder, go to the port
collision bulkhead.

279
00:31:09,982 --> 00:31:13,645
Jack and I'll work back from the fore.
Call if you need anything.

280
00:31:13,819 --> 00:31:17,220
-How about a pizza?
-You're so funny.

281
00:31:17,423 --> 00:31:22,190
The only plan in this business is that
there is no plan. What is that?

282
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:27,889
What these people talking crazy for?
That's not even good English.

283
00:31:29,635 --> 00:31:31,432
Hang in there, okay, preciosa?

284
00:31:31,604 --> 00:31:35,301
Because someday he'll find
some other genius to fix his boat.

285
00:31:39,178 --> 00:31:40,941
You want to play like that?

286
00:31:43,783 --> 00:31:45,375
It's still sweet, though.

287
00:31:45,885 --> 00:31:48,046
Light coming up.

288
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:58,728
You were right. She is beautiful.

289
00:31:58,898 --> 00:31:59,990
She sure is.

290
00:32:39,872 --> 00:32:45,333
Epps, we're heading for
the main engine room. Epps?

291
00:33:09,768 --> 00:33:12,236
All right, capitano.

292
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,664
Oh, shit.

293
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:24,098
We're gonna have to dive
to get to that tear.

294
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:28,571
Epps, the engine room
is totally flooded.

295
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:32,573
Epps, can you hear me?

296
00:35:39,485 --> 00:35:40,645
Wait!

297
00:35:43,055 --> 00:35:45,888
What happened? You okay?

298
00:35:46,091 --> 00:35:49,822
What are you doing down there?
Did you hurt yourself?

299
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:29,333
What are you doing?

300
00:36:33,105 --> 00:36:36,165
The whole bottom's riddled with them.

301
00:36:36,475 --> 00:36:38,773
Looks like someone
used it for target practice.

302
00:36:39,178 --> 00:36:42,670
-That's the happy version.
-What's the not-so-happy version?

303
00:36:42,881 --> 00:36:45,441
There were people in there.

304
00:36:45,717 --> 00:36:47,776
I saw that little girl again.

305
00:36:47,953 --> 00:36:50,945
What? Where?

306
00:36:52,124 --> 00:36:56,288
-I must be losing my goddamn mind.
-Well, did she say anything?

307
00:36:56,462 --> 00:36:59,124
Forget it. Come on.

308
00:37:25,858 --> 00:37:27,758
Murphy, come in.

309
00:37:28,527 --> 00:37:31,052
Dodge! Anybody!

310
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:33,420
Shit.

311
00:37:37,503 --> 00:37:39,835
I think she's fucking with us.

312
00:38:23,782 --> 00:38:26,546
Looks like central laundry.

313
00:38:31,557 --> 00:38:36,392
This vent connects to the forward hold.
We need to see if it's flooded.

314
00:38:36,595 --> 00:38:40,031
-I may need help shutting it.
-You sure we need to--?

315
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,350
Murphy, where the hell are you?

316
00:39:00,686 --> 00:39:04,087
-How long have they been here?
-A month, maybe less.

317
00:39:04,289 --> 00:39:07,452
-What are we gonna do?
-Get off this boat!

318
00:39:07,626 --> 00:39:10,060
-But the ship--
-lf it sinks, it sinks.

319
00:39:10,229 --> 00:39:12,254
You're right.

320
00:39:12,464 --> 00:39:14,557
Stinks.

321
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:18,801
-What the hell?
-We came through there.

322
00:39:18,971 --> 00:39:20,700
No shit!

323
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:26,434
Come on!

324
00:39:29,648 --> 00:39:32,378
This way. Come on, Jack.

325
00:39:49,234 --> 00:39:50,599
What the--?

326
00:39:57,976 --> 00:40:00,945
When'd you start
wearing lipstick, Epps?

327
00:40:01,647 --> 00:40:03,376
Epps?

328
00:40:06,918 --> 00:40:09,250
" Francesca."

329
00:40:09,855 --> 00:40:11,413
Nice titties.

330
00:40:12,357 --> 00:40:17,590
Not that you can hold a candle
to the future Mrs. Greer, though.

331
00:40:30,275 --> 00:40:35,577
Come on, Jack. Stop dragging ass!
What's your problem?

332
00:40:40,986 --> 00:40:42,647
What's this?

333
00:40:42,954 --> 00:40:46,185
Forget it. Let's go! Jack!

334
00:40:47,726 --> 00:40:51,594
' 58 Jaguar X1 50. I've dreamt
about this car since I was a kid.

335
00:40:51,763 --> 00:40:56,097
We have to get out of here now.
Do you understand? Now.

336
00:41:03,008 --> 00:41:06,307
There's something moving in there.

337
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:24,455
Fuck!

338
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:27,290
Oh, my God!
I hate rats!

339
00:41:29,935 --> 00:41:31,562
What?

340
00:41:32,371 --> 00:41:34,805
Oh, my God! Look at this!

341
00:41:35,741 --> 00:41:37,208
I have to get Murphy.

342
00:41:37,642 --> 00:41:39,132
Murphy!

343
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,975
Is someone trying to call me?

344
00:41:48,186 --> 00:41:50,416
Dodge! Munder!

345
00:41:51,123 --> 00:41:53,318
Maureen....

346
00:41:53,892 --> 00:41:56,053
Who's Maureen?

347
00:41:56,228 --> 00:41:58,492
It's my first name.

348
00:42:00,332 --> 00:42:03,733
-It's cold....
-He said "cold"?

349
00:42:03,902 --> 00:42:05,836
The galley.

350
00:42:14,813 --> 00:42:18,340
-It's cold.
-Please help us.

351
00:42:23,722 --> 00:42:25,747
Don't go in there.

352
00:43:03,962 --> 00:43:07,227
You fucking assholes!
Fuck you!

353
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,200
Take it easy!

354
00:43:10,368 --> 00:43:14,668
You were fucking with us. We fucked
with you. Why aren't you laughing?

355
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:19,277
Wanna hear something funnier? We
found dead guys in the laundry room.

356
00:43:19,611 --> 00:43:23,240
And this in the cargo hold.

357
00:43:36,027 --> 00:43:37,585
Need some help, skipper?

358
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,492
I'm sorry.

359
00:44:01,353 --> 00:44:03,048
-Jesus.
-Oh, man.

360
00:44:03,255 --> 00:44:05,314
Holy shit!

361
00:44:09,828 --> 00:44:11,295
Yeah!

362
00:44:12,531 --> 00:44:14,158
We're rich!

363
00:44:15,534 --> 00:44:18,526
-You son of a bitch!
-Rich!

364
00:44:22,474 --> 00:44:25,238
-Come on. Let's go.
-Move this shit out!

365
00:44:26,111 --> 00:44:28,306
One. Two. Three....

366
00:44:45,864 --> 00:44:48,492
How much you figure it's worth, boss?

367
00:44:48,667 --> 00:44:53,832
There's a lot of gold. Hard to know.
Two, 300 million, maybe. Maybe more.

368
00:44:54,005 --> 00:44:55,768
-Jesus.
-I don't know.

369
00:44:55,974 --> 00:44:59,341
Lock boxes with half of Fort Knox
in them? They gotta be insured.

370
00:44:59,544 --> 00:45:03,002
No way somebody will let
this much gold float away.

371
00:45:03,214 --> 00:45:06,342
Well, the markings have been
filed down.

372
00:45:06,851 --> 00:45:10,947
-What does that mean?
-Someone didn't want this traceable.

373
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:13,181
It's stolen.

374
00:45:13,391 --> 00:45:18,124
It may have to do with the reason
this ship disappeared when it did.

375
00:45:18,296 --> 00:45:21,697
Wait. If the gold's got
something to do with 1 962...

376
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:26,064
...what about the bodies? They can't be
more than three weeks old.

377
00:45:26,538 --> 00:45:31,373
Somebody's gotta say it, and it might as
well be me. This ship is fucked up.

378
00:45:31,543 --> 00:45:36,776
Earlier I could swear I heard
a woman singing. It's like she was....

379
00:45:36,982 --> 00:45:39,576
-Like she was coming on to me.
-Oh, no!

380
00:45:44,055 --> 00:45:47,047
It was the sexiest voice
I ever heard, man.

381
00:45:47,258 --> 00:45:53,493
-She got any backup singers?
-Whatever you're on, get me some!

382
00:45:53,698 --> 00:45:57,725
Maybe you're not quite
ready to get married, Greer.

383
00:45:57,902 --> 00:45:59,301
-Fuck you.
-Okay, guys.

384
00:45:59,804 --> 00:46:02,500
-What about the Coast Guard?
-No.

385
00:46:02,707 --> 00:46:07,303
You call the Coast Guard.... What if
the gold did turn out to be stolen?

386
00:46:09,981 --> 00:46:13,917
Under maritime law, anything
found in international waters...

387
00:46:14,085 --> 00:46:17,748
...belongs to the finder. Okay?
That is the law.

388
00:46:17,956 --> 00:46:20,584
-Right.
-Finders keepers.

389
00:46:20,792 --> 00:46:23,659
If we're gonna do this,
I say we do it now.

390
00:46:23,862 --> 00:46:28,128
Get our boat going, grab the gold
and get the hell out of here.

391
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:31,325
We leave the boat, take the gold.
Who's with me?

392
00:46:31,903 --> 00:46:34,428
I'm with the gold, man.

393
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,039
Gold.

394
00:46:37,709 --> 00:46:39,472
The gold.

395
00:46:43,181 --> 00:46:46,048
-Epps?
-I just want to get off this boat.

396
00:46:46,584 --> 00:46:48,449
Okay. Let's go to work.

397
00:46:50,288 --> 00:46:55,225
Okay. Warrior is in position, Murph.
Can we please get the hell out of here?

398
00:46:56,828 --> 00:47:01,765
Yeah, preciosa! Smell that money!
1 00 million. You hear what I'm saying?

399
00:47:01,933 --> 00:47:03,662
1 00 million!

400
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:07,897
Greer? Get those engines going.

401
00:47:08,106 --> 00:47:09,971
I'm bringing the gold down.

402
00:47:10,141 --> 00:47:11,836
Yes, sir, captain, sir.

403
00:47:12,711 --> 00:47:17,045
Hey, Santos. Hurry your ass up, vato.
We got to go like this.

404
00:47:18,183 --> 00:47:22,620
I wanna see these gauges rocking,
because you just had an overhaul.

405
00:47:23,955 --> 00:47:26,651
And you, I want you
to give me some too.

406
00:47:31,296 --> 00:47:33,526
Let's do this!

407
00:47:34,265 --> 00:47:36,563
Hey, yo, Greer! Fire it up!

408
00:47:36,768 --> 00:47:40,704
We're going to haul ass.
Bring it on! We'll be so fucking rich!

409
00:47:41,906 --> 00:47:43,771
Stop!

410
00:47:44,109 --> 00:47:46,475
Stop! You don't know
what you're doing!

411
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:49,240
We're good to go, skipper.

412
00:47:53,218 --> 00:47:55,243
Don't start the boats! He'll--

413
00:47:56,821 --> 00:47:58,118
Shit!

414
00:47:58,823 --> 00:48:00,347
Greer!

415
00:48:03,728 --> 00:48:05,889
Greer! What the hell just happened?

416
00:48:07,065 --> 00:48:09,966
Jesus Christ! Fire on deck!

417
00:48:20,278 --> 00:48:23,645
Santos! Greer! Munder!

418
00:48:40,298 --> 00:48:41,925
I got you.

419
00:48:42,133 --> 00:48:46,194
-Epps! I got Munder!
-Greer!

420
00:48:47,872 --> 00:48:49,601
Come on!

421
00:48:50,542 --> 00:48:54,638
Santos!
Santos, answer me!

422
00:49:15,466 --> 00:49:21,166
I don't know what happened.
The engine room just blew.

423
00:49:21,506 --> 00:49:25,442
Maybe Santos rushed the engines,
didn't seal up the gaskets right....

424
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:30,147
Jack, did you find anything out about
this ship before you sent us out here?

425
00:49:30,815 --> 00:49:34,774
No, but l.... Look, we've got
the gold, and we are still alive.

426
00:49:34,986 --> 00:49:37,716
-Tell that to Santos, asshole!
-Ease up!

427
00:49:37,889 --> 00:49:39,686
This is bullshit!

428
00:49:39,891 --> 00:49:42,052
Santos came here out of free will...

429
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:45,127
-...just like us.
-What does that mean?

430
00:49:45,296 --> 00:49:47,491
-Enough!
-Santos is dead because of you!

431
00:49:47,699 --> 00:49:50,395
Come on! It's not gonna
bring him back.

432
00:50:10,154 --> 00:50:13,317
Murph, it's not your fault.
You know that.

433
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:27,370
How is he?

434
00:50:29,207 --> 00:50:34,201
Here's the plan. We're professional
salvors with a fortune onboard.

435
00:50:34,479 --> 00:50:37,744
I say we do what we do best:
fix this rust bucket.

436
00:50:37,916 --> 00:50:40,476
Control her drift. Clear those islands.

437
00:50:40,652 --> 00:50:43,177
We can survive long enough
to get picked up.

438
00:50:43,388 --> 00:50:46,448
Why is this a question?
We have the materials.

439
00:50:46,624 --> 00:50:52,221
Why don't we build a raft and leave?
There is something wrong with this boat!

440
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:55,922
-lf we stay here, we may not survive.
-You want to build a raft?

441
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,728
-I want to build a raft.
-Even with the Warrior...

442
00:50:58,937 --> 00:51:03,169
...we were stretching to do this
in three days. We can't do this.

443
00:51:03,341 --> 00:51:05,809
You're the best spot-welder I know.

444
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:07,944
We can do it right now,
but I need you.

445
00:51:11,181 --> 00:51:16,414
Fine. But there's no way we're doing
a major patch-and-pump in the dark.

446
00:51:16,587 --> 00:51:19,055
Even with the lights we have,
it'd be like going in blind.

447
00:51:19,223 --> 00:51:22,750
Okay, fine. We'll chill tonight
and go in the a.m.

448
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:28,428
Greer? What do you say?

449
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:32,535
Now you want to know what
the first mate has to say?

450
00:51:32,703 --> 00:51:37,003
I say go to hell, Epps. You're not
qualified to get us off this ship.

451
00:51:37,174 --> 00:51:40,405
Had Murphy let me do it my way,
we wouldn't be in this.

452
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:44,638
-And the Coast Guard--
-So it's everybody else's fault, right?

453
00:51:44,815 --> 00:51:48,080
They'd be here and we'd
be on our way home, millionaires.

454
00:51:48,252 --> 00:51:49,480
That's bullshit.

455
00:51:50,654 --> 00:51:52,087
Grow up, asshole.

456
00:51:53,657 --> 00:51:57,457
Fucking bitch! Keep fucking talking.
Say another word!

457
00:51:58,195 --> 00:52:00,390
Say another word!

458
00:52:50,714 --> 00:52:53,615
Here it is. Katie. B-deck.

459
00:52:53,784 --> 00:52:55,183
You were alone.

460
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:03,055
1 00-to- 1, somebody poisoned
the passengers to get the gold.

461
00:53:03,227 --> 00:53:07,061
Okay, Sherlock, if they were poisoned,
why are these cans safe?

462
00:53:07,231 --> 00:53:11,224
They're still sealed.
It's been sealed for 40 years. It's safe.

463
00:53:11,401 --> 00:53:14,598
Okay, shoot for it. Loser goes first.

464
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:19,576
-Paper beats rock.
-Come on, man, best of three.

465
00:53:19,843 --> 00:53:22,903
-Bullshit. You lost.
-Where's your empathy?

466
00:53:23,113 --> 00:53:27,516
Winners do not empathize
with losers. Bon appetit.

467
00:53:37,261 --> 00:53:38,785
I screwed up.

468
00:53:39,563 --> 00:53:41,258
I should've called it in.

469
00:53:41,732 --> 00:53:44,826
Damn! I knew better!

470
00:53:46,169 --> 00:53:49,195
I'll make it home to you, baby.
I swear.

471
00:53:51,842 --> 00:53:53,867
What the hell are you looking at?

472
00:54:03,553 --> 00:54:05,384
-That's all right.
-No way.

473
00:54:05,555 --> 00:54:08,786
No, really. It's good.
Look, I'm not kidding.

474
00:54:09,026 --> 00:54:12,120
-Are you serious?
-I'm serious. It's good!

475
00:54:15,499 --> 00:54:17,933
-You gotta try that!
-That's good!

476
00:54:18,135 --> 00:54:19,159
That's great!

477
00:54:20,537 --> 00:54:22,164
Katie?

478
00:54:29,346 --> 00:54:31,337
Katie?

479
00:54:51,668 --> 00:54:53,863
Can I tell you something else?
We get back...

480
00:54:54,071 --> 00:54:58,667
...I'm gonna take my money
and I'm gonna buy you a bathtub.

481
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:03,869
I'll get you a lifetime supply
of titty magazines and toilet paper!

482
00:55:04,381 --> 00:55:06,872
I already beat you to it, bro!

483
00:55:12,222 --> 00:55:13,849
There's something on your....

484
00:55:32,876 --> 00:55:34,776
Katie?

485
00:58:39,563 --> 00:58:41,360
Who, me?

486
00:58:46,903 --> 00:58:49,531
Francesca, I know
all of this isn't real.

487
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:54,101
So I'm just gonna go with it, okay?

488
00:58:57,214 --> 00:59:00,547
Can't cheat on your fiancee
with a dead girl, right?

489
00:59:28,445 --> 00:59:30,811
Her parents.

490
00:59:33,617 --> 00:59:35,482
Please.

491
00:59:37,487 --> 00:59:39,853
Don't close it.

492
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:45,957
Haven't seen them for years.

493
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:49,221
They moved to New York.

494
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:52,896
I was on my way to join them.

495
00:59:54,738 --> 00:59:56,171
But they're dead now.

496
00:59:58,475 --> 01:00:01,137
-How would you know?
-When you're like this...

497
01:00:01,344 --> 01:00:03,175
...you know these things.

498
01:00:05,048 --> 01:00:06,675
My mother...

499
01:00:08,285 --> 01:00:11,482
...she made me this dress.

500
01:00:11,688 --> 01:00:12,848
Do you like it?

501
01:00:18,161 --> 01:00:20,288
You remind me of her.

502
01:00:21,898 --> 01:00:24,162
I don't think so.

503
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:30,271
Well, here. You should have this back.

504
01:00:37,013 --> 01:00:40,312
Oh, God, you really are
a fucking ghost.

505
01:00:45,155 --> 01:00:47,282
Where are you going?

506
01:01:00,603 --> 01:01:04,903
Santos was my goddamn responsibility.

507
01:01:17,921 --> 01:01:22,153
-The Lorelei.
-She was adrift. We rescued her.

508
01:01:22,359 --> 01:01:25,556
I've heard the story of the Lorelei.

509
01:01:27,197 --> 01:01:30,166
I didn't know the Graza was involved.

510
01:01:32,736 --> 01:01:35,204
The gold was onboard the Lorelei?

511
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:41,934
It says here " May 1 9, 1 962."

512
01:01:42,846 --> 01:01:46,373
That's two days before
your ship disappeared.

513
01:01:48,551 --> 01:01:52,146
There were no survivors
onboard the Lorelei.

514
01:01:59,796 --> 01:02:01,093
Jesus Christ!

515
01:02:06,302 --> 01:02:08,361
Where you going?

516
01:02:28,691 --> 01:02:31,888
Most spirits are free
to be with their families.

517
01:02:32,195 --> 01:02:35,062
So why aren't you with yours?

518
01:02:38,468 --> 01:02:41,733
-We're all trapped here.
-Who?

519
01:02:43,106 --> 01:02:45,301
My shipmates and l.

520
01:02:45,942 --> 01:02:48,604
Even the ones who aren't marked.

521
01:02:48,945 --> 01:02:50,173
Marked?

522
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,641
Katie, what do you mean?

523
01:02:52,816 --> 01:02:55,307
When the boat's full....

524
01:02:56,386 --> 01:02:58,081
What? You can tell me.

525
01:02:58,922 --> 01:03:03,825
When he has all the souls he needs
and has filled his quota...

526
01:03:05,762 --> 01:03:08,253
...we'll all be ferried...

527
01:03:08,898 --> 01:03:10,297
...to....

528
01:03:11,634 --> 01:03:13,329
What is it? What's wrong?

529
01:03:15,505 --> 01:03:18,804
-What is it?
-He doesn't want me talking to you.

530
01:03:19,008 --> 01:03:21,670
-He who?
-But I'm not like the others!

531
01:03:21,878 --> 01:03:23,505
You need to tell me.

532
01:03:23,713 --> 01:03:28,013
You must go at once.
Leave the ship while you still can!

533
01:03:28,218 --> 01:03:30,049
Katie, what is it?

534
01:03:31,788 --> 01:03:36,691
Katie! Katie?

535
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:38,293
Epps?

536
01:03:39,262 --> 01:03:40,889
Come on!

537
01:03:41,464 --> 01:03:42,954
We have to leave.

538
01:03:45,768 --> 01:03:47,565
Where you going, Murphy?

539
01:03:51,107 --> 01:03:53,871
What's the matter? It's me.

540
01:03:54,377 --> 01:03:55,503
Santos.

541
01:03:56,279 --> 01:03:59,737
It's no fun lying
at the bottom of the ocean.

542
01:04:03,353 --> 01:04:07,050
No lights at the end of the tunnel.
Not for me, Murph.

543
01:04:08,391 --> 01:04:11,155
No 1 0,000 virgins at the pearly gates.

544
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:17,898
Because of the plan, I'm trapped
on this dreamboat of yours.

545
01:04:18,134 --> 01:04:22,537
So you know what?
You're coming along for the ride.

546
01:04:44,961 --> 01:04:46,588
No!

547
01:04:54,971 --> 01:04:56,029
Murphy?

548
01:05:07,417 --> 01:05:09,647
You all right, Murph?

549
01:05:11,955 --> 01:05:13,286
You okay?

550
01:05:17,427 --> 01:05:19,657
-What's the matter, Murph?
-It's me!

551
01:05:26,769 --> 01:05:30,762
-It's me!
-Do it, come on. It'll make you feel good.

552
01:05:38,281 --> 01:05:39,270
Come on!

553
01:05:46,389 --> 01:05:48,584
-Come on!
-Hey!

554
01:05:56,265 --> 01:05:59,325
Oh, God.
Epps, you okay?

555
01:06:03,873 --> 01:06:07,502
-Keep him in the aquarium.
-No, listen. He was drunk.

556
01:06:07,677 --> 01:06:10,475
He didn't know what he was doing.

557
01:06:10,647 --> 01:06:14,743
Look, he just tried to kill you.
He stays in there.

558
01:06:15,518 --> 01:06:17,986
Let's go find Greer.

559
01:06:29,165 --> 01:06:31,395
Any sign of him?

560
01:06:31,634 --> 01:06:36,537
No, we looked all over. Man's pissed off.
Seems to happen on this boat.

561
01:06:37,106 --> 01:06:40,507
-Least we weren't around 40 years ago.
-The passengers were poisoned...

562
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:44,806
-...to get to the gold? Isn't that--?
-Extreme? Maybe, but if the shoe fits....

563
01:06:45,114 --> 01:06:48,140
Next thing you know,
we'll be trying to kill each other.

564
01:06:48,351 --> 01:06:52,378
-What's with the heart?
-Found it. Belonged to this little girl.

565
01:06:52,555 --> 01:06:56,116
-What girl?
-She told me to get off this boat.

566
01:06:56,292 --> 01:06:59,819
-She's talking to you now?
-What are you talking about?

567
01:06:59,996 --> 01:07:03,363
-You're seeing ghosts, Epps?
-Just forget it.

568
01:07:03,533 --> 01:07:05,592
So the ship's got a few kinks.

569
01:07:05,768 --> 01:07:09,829
Let's stick with Munder's specs
and try to fix the ship.

570
01:07:10,006 --> 01:07:13,339
No way five people and the gold
will fit on any raft.

571
01:07:13,509 --> 01:07:17,001
Murphy's not going anywhere,
and we're not leaving him here.

572
01:07:17,213 --> 01:07:21,274
We stick with the plan. Fix the boat.
Let's get going. Come on.

573
01:07:31,794 --> 01:07:34,354
That's the collision bulkhead hatch.

574
01:07:34,697 --> 01:07:38,258
-Wheel's busted. It won't open.
-Arming the C4.

575
01:07:38,468 --> 01:07:39,526
-Dodge?
-I'm good.

576
01:07:39,702 --> 01:07:41,101
-Munder?
-I'm good.

577
01:07:41,304 --> 01:07:43,204
Contact.

578
01:07:47,443 --> 01:07:51,072
-There 's the tear, portside.
-Looks bigger from here.

579
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,874
I'll shut her up, no problem.

580
01:07:56,519 --> 01:08:01,582
-Munder, rudder's fixed. You all right?
-I'm good.

581
01:08:02,692 --> 01:08:05,923
- What do you think, Dodge?
-She 'll hold.

582
01:08:09,265 --> 01:08:12,234
- We 're set with the pumps.
-Start them up.

583
01:08:13,536 --> 01:08:16,562
Copy that, Epps.
One and two, kicking in.

584
01:08:16,739 --> 01:08:20,368
-I give it 1 2 hours till she's bone-dry.
-Both on full.

585
01:08:20,543 --> 01:08:23,637
Get ready, Epps. Here it comes.

586
01:08:23,846 --> 01:08:25,177
Great work, guys.

587
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:46,698
Damn. Current' s faster than I thought.

588
01:08:48,671 --> 01:08:55,008
If we control her drift, headed in this
direction, we should clear those islands.

589
01:08:55,178 --> 01:08:58,079
We'll keep it afloat
until we get picked up.

590
01:08:58,247 --> 01:09:01,478
Son of a bitch.
We may just get out of this yet.

591
01:09:01,684 --> 01:09:02,878
Kazillionaires.

592
01:09:03,052 --> 01:09:05,850
Check on the bridge
when you're done here.

593
01:09:06,022 --> 01:09:08,547
I'll see if I can find Greer
down below.

594
01:09:13,129 --> 01:09:15,222
Greer?

595
01:09:31,714 --> 01:09:33,409
Katie?

596
01:09:45,928 --> 01:09:48,192
Greer? Jesus!

597
01:09:55,905 --> 01:09:58,567
-Shit.
-Number two's clogged. Who's going?

598
01:09:58,741 --> 01:10:00,766
You go.

599
01:10:02,578 --> 01:10:04,603
Shit. Every single time!

600
01:10:07,783 --> 01:10:10,308
Oh, my God.

601
01:10:10,486 --> 01:10:12,351
Come with me.

602
01:10:14,123 --> 01:10:16,114
I want to show you something.

603
01:14:39,054 --> 01:14:40,646
No!

604
01:14:40,856 --> 01:14:43,017
Come on! No!

605
01:14:43,526 --> 01:14:45,756
Come on!

606
01:14:46,896 --> 01:14:50,195
You can't die on me!

607
01:15:44,453 --> 01:15:47,217
Dodge. Murphy's dead.

608
01:15:47,423 --> 01:15:49,789
-What?
-We have to get off this boat.

609
01:15:49,992 --> 01:15:54,156
There's a reason you, me and Munder are
still alive. That's why he came after us.

610
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:58,289
-To fix his ship.
-I just saw Murphy. What's happening?

611
01:16:01,403 --> 01:16:03,030
I don't know.

612
01:16:05,274 --> 01:16:07,674
I want you and Dodge
on the rudder.

613
01:16:07,843 --> 01:16:10,107
-But you just said--
-Listen to me.

614
01:16:10,613 --> 01:16:16,609
I'll get Munder, we'll see if the welds
are holding. Stay here till we get back.

615
01:16:16,819 --> 01:16:20,311
I do not want you out of
each other's sight. Take this.

616
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:22,924
Take it.

617
01:16:24,927 --> 01:16:27,862
-Be careful down there.
-I will.

618
01:17:22,584 --> 01:17:25,815
-That's it, then. We made it.
-For now.

619
01:17:26,422 --> 01:17:29,482
-I'll check on Epps.
-No, she said to wait here.

620
01:17:29,692 --> 01:17:33,128
-Yeah, but--
-Hey, she said to wait! So wait.

621
01:17:46,942 --> 01:17:48,637
You disgust me.

622
01:17:48,811 --> 01:17:51,609
-What did you say?
-You heard me.

623
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:55,807
You're a pathetic excuse for a man.
She says, "Jump," and you jump.

624
01:17:56,018 --> 01:17:59,215
You're disgusting.
I don't have time for this.

625
01:18:05,127 --> 01:18:09,826
-Who the hell are you?
-The question is, who are you?

626
01:18:09,998 --> 01:18:13,365
You worship her, yet you've
never had the balls to tell her...

627
01:18:13,569 --> 01:18:16,231
...because you're a weak,
cowardly child.

628
01:18:16,805 --> 01:18:22,766
However, if you'll kindly step out of
my way, I'll make your dream a reality.

629
01:18:24,179 --> 01:18:27,671
You know, Dodge, if you kill somebody,
you go to hell.

630
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:33,612
Well, you live for her.
You willing to die for her?

631
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:21,200
I shot Ferriman. He's dead.

632
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:24,134
Yeah? Don't be so sure, Dodge.

633
01:19:24,339 --> 01:19:28,173
-What are you doing?
-Trip's over. I'm sinking the boat.

634
01:19:28,343 --> 01:19:30,937
-It's taken its last victim.
-That'll kill us.

635
01:19:31,113 --> 01:19:33,809
-We'll have to take our chances.
-What about the gold?

636
01:19:34,016 --> 01:19:38,350
Fucking kidding? We're not getting the
gold off this boat. Nobody ever does.

637
01:19:38,554 --> 01:19:40,454
Wait, wait. Wait!

638
01:19:41,023 --> 01:19:44,754
That gold can give us everything
we ever wanted.

639
01:19:44,927 --> 01:19:48,522
We could have our own boat.
The two of us.

640
01:19:48,697 --> 01:19:51,928
We could have a life together.
You and me.

641
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:56,366
What are you talking about?
Dodge, we gotta get out of here. Now.

642
01:19:57,039 --> 01:19:59,564
Well, I can't let you do that.

643
01:20:07,216 --> 01:20:09,116
So that's it, huh?

644
01:20:11,019 --> 01:20:13,681
All right. Okay.

645
01:20:13,856 --> 01:20:16,222
You win. All right.

646
01:20:19,094 --> 01:20:21,187
Fucking bitch!

647
01:20:21,396 --> 01:20:23,990
All right, you win! Go ahead, do it!

648
01:20:24,199 --> 01:20:26,463
Go ahead. Blow it up!

649
01:20:26,668 --> 01:20:28,067
Kill us all!

650
01:20:30,672 --> 01:20:35,336
Hey, Dodge. Why haven't you
asked me where Munder is?

651
01:20:42,518 --> 01:20:45,487
Well, I suppose that's because...

652
01:20:46,889 --> 01:20:48,550
...I already know.

653
01:20:49,091 --> 01:20:52,424
-You won't pull that trigger, Maureen.
-Try me.

654
01:20:52,928 --> 01:20:56,159
Dodge made the same mistake.
He's dead.

655
01:20:58,233 --> 01:21:00,030
Katie told you, didn't she?

656
01:21:00,202 --> 01:21:04,434
Souls without sin can't be marked.
Makes them tough to control.

657
01:21:04,606 --> 01:21:08,007
But as long as I keep the boat afloat,
we'll all go down together.

658
01:21:08,176 --> 01:21:11,634
-What the fuck are you?
-I'm a salvager.

659
01:21:11,813 --> 01:21:16,716
Just like you.
You collect ships, I collect souls.

660
01:21:16,885 --> 01:21:20,446
And when I fill my quota,
I send a boatload home.

661
01:21:20,656 --> 01:21:24,422
This will make management happy.
You see, it's a job.

662
01:21:24,626 --> 01:21:27,220
Given to me after a lifetime of sin.

663
01:21:27,396 --> 01:21:33,096
So if I lose this ship, management won't
be happy, which is not a good thing.

664
01:21:33,569 --> 01:21:37,630
I'm not getting through to you.
I'm asking for an exchange.

665
01:21:37,973 --> 01:21:40,271
This ship for your life.

666
01:21:40,442 --> 01:21:42,535
I want my crew back.

667
01:21:42,844 --> 01:21:46,780
Sorry. Once a passenger's marked,
they're mine.

668
01:21:47,249 --> 01:21:49,649
Then I guess it's over.

669
01:21:59,361 --> 01:22:01,556
All you had to do was fix the ship!

670
01:22:05,767 --> 01:22:08,497
I gave you a great opportunity.

671
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:11,065
All you had to do was take it.

672
01:22:15,944 --> 01:22:18,742
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

673
01:25:42,617 --> 01:25:45,450
Careful. Hang in there, ma'am.

674
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:13,548
No!

675
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:36,299
