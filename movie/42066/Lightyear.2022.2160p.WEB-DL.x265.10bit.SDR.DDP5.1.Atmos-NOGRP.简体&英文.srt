1995年 一个名叫安迪的男孩在生日时得到了一个巴斯光年玩具
In 1995, a boy named Andy got a Buzz Lightyear toy for his birthday.

2
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,880
这是他最喜欢的电影中的内容
It was from his favorite movie.

3
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,640
这就是那部电影
This is that movie.

4
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,940
未知的空间 距离地球420万光年
UNCHARTED SPACE 4.2 MILLION LIGHT YEARS FROM EARTH

7
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,100
传感器检测到潜在的生命形式
Sensors have detected potential life forms.

8
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,400
在一个未知的星球上
on an uncharted planet.

9
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,610
因此 我们要绕道调查
So, we're making a detour to investigate.

10
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,030
太空巡警将进行初步评估
Space Rangers will make initial evaluation,

11
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
然后评估是否值得把科学人员从超级睡眠中唤醒
then assess whether it's worth waking the science crew

12
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,450
是否值得把科学人员从他们的超级睡眠中唤醒
from their hyper-sleep.

13
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,290
当ERIC号采集核心样本时
While the ERIC takes core samples

14
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,210
我将进一步探索这个陌生星球的怪异之处
I will explore further the oddities of this strange planet.

15
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,900
地形似乎有点不稳定
Terrain seems a bit unstable.

16
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,610
还没有读出该地区是否可以呼吸
No read-out yet if the area is breathable.

17
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,860
似乎没有任何地方有智慧生命的迹象
There seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere.

18
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,740
-你在和谁说话？-没有人
-Who are you talking to? -No one.

19
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,160
你又在叙述了
You were narrating again.

20
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,910
我没有 只是在做任务记录
I was not. Just doing the mission log.

21
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,240
你知道没有人听他们说过
You do know no one ever listens to them.

22
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,790
我知道 叙述有助于我集中注意力
I know that, narrating helps me with focus.

23
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,540
-保持敏锐 -是的
-Stay sharp. -Yeah.

24
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,960
好吧 如果它困扰着你 霍桑指挥官
Well, if it bothers you, Commander Hawthorne.

25
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,630
我很高兴等萝卜回来
I'm happy to wait back on the turnip.

26
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,170
请不要叫它萝卜
Please don't call it the turnip.

27
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,050
但这艘船看起来像根蔬菜
But the ship looks like a root vegetable.

28
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,220
是的 你在设计审查时说得很清楚
Yes, you made that very clear at the design review.

29
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,730
你知道我解说有多久了？
How long have you known that I narrate?

30
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,940
永远 自从你和我还是学员的时候
Forever. Since you and I were cadets.

31
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,190
说到这里 你忘了带着那个菜鸟
Speaking of, you forgot to take the rookie with you.

32
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,610
啊 霍桑指挥官 你知道我对新秀的感觉
Ah, Commander Hawthorne, you know how I feel about rookies.

33
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,490
这和我对自动驾驶的感觉一样
It's the same way I feel about autopilots.

34
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,240
"有什么可以协助你的吗？有什么我可以做的吗 先生？"
"How may I assist you? Is there anything I can do, sir?"

35
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,540
他们没有帮助 他们只是把事情搞得过于复杂
They don't help, they just over-complicate things.

36
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,450
我最好还是自己来做这件事
I'm better off just doing the job myself.

37
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,210
这就是为什么我带来了这个新秀
Which is why I brought the rookie.

38
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,670
你好
Hello.

39
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,920
-不 -巴兹 协议要求我们把他带上
-No. -Buzz, protocol requires we bring him along.

40
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,300
-他将会有一双悲伤的眼睛 -巴兹
-He's gonna have sad eyes. -Buzz.

41
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,920
你知道我不能处理悲伤的眼睛
You know I can't deal with sad eyes.

42
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,130
-看看这个新秀 巴兹 -不
-Look at the rookie, Buzz. -No.

43
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,970
-看那只罗... ...看... -不... ...不
-Look at the roo...Look... -No...no.

44
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:42,890
-光年 -不
-Lightyear. -No.

45
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,050
-看他 -不看
-Look at him. -Not looking.

46
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:44,970
-看 -看 -不

47
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,430
-看看这个新秀 -不 不

48
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,060
好的 好吧 好吧 你赢了
All right. All right. You win.

49
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,650
看 费瑟... 费瑟汉姆斯坦...
Look, Feather...Featheringhamstan...

50
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,690
是Featheringhamstan 长官
It's Featheringhamstan, sir.

51
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,110
听着 菜鸟 首先 除非有人说话 否则你不能说话
Look, rookie, first, you will not speak unless spoken to.

52
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,200
-是的 长官 -仍在说话
-Yes, sir. -Still talking.

53
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,200
第二 尊重这套衣服
Second, respect the suit.

54
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,070
这套衣服意味着什么
This suit means something.

55
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,080
它不仅仅是在保护你的身体 更是在保护整个宇宙
It's not just protecting your body, it's protecting the universe.

56
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,400
这套衣服是对世界的一个承诺 你
This suit is a promise to the world that you,

57
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,540
只有你会做一件事 而不是其他
and you alone will do one thing above all.

58
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,880
不惜一切代价完成任务
Finnish the mission no matter the cost.

59
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,880
你永远不会放弃 不管银河系会给你带来什么... ...
You will never quit, whatever the galaxy may throw your way--

60
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,510
请你把它关掉！
Will you please turn that off!

61
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,010
这也太容易了
It's just too easy.

62
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,140
你在嘲笑我 是吗？
You're mocking me, aren't you?

63
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,390
是的 但是以一种支持的方式
Yeah, but in a supportive way.

64
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,600
听着 我想说的是 指挥官 你和我已经把这项工作搞定了
Look, what I'm trying to say, Commander, is that you and I have this job down.

65
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,890
-长官 -还在说
-Sir. -Still talking.

66
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,690
在任何时候我都知道你在想什么 我知道你会去哪里
At any moment I know what you're thinking, I know where you're gonna be.

67
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,310
但这个人 我不知道
But this guy, I don't know.

68
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
他去哪了？
Where'd he go?

69
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,150
你看到了吗？这正是我所要说的
You see? This is exactly what I'm talking about.

70
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,860
他不是在帮忙 他走神了
He's not helping. He's wandered off.

71
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,700
籐条！
Vines!

72
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:53,910
虫子！
Bugs!

73
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,050
这艘船 它正在下沉
The ship. It's sinking.

74
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,510
各位 回到萝卜上！
Everyone, back to the turnip!

75
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,010
哦 所以现在是萝卜了
Oh, so now it's the turnip.

76
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,560
启动隐身模式 这应该为我们争取到足够的时间
Engage Stealth Mode. That should buy us enough time.

77
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,480
我们不会成功的
We're not gonna make it.

78
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,990
快到了！
Almost there!

79
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,610
好了 B计划 准备好了吗？
Okay, plan B. Ready?

80
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,530
开始！
Go!

81
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,550
-爆炸！-在这里 我可以重新安排路线
-Blast! -Here, I can re-route it.

82
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,720
给我点时间
Just give me a minute.

83
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,090
哪里是...
Where is the...

84
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,510
救命啊！
Help!

85
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,930
菜鸟
rookie.

86
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,310
救救我！
Help me!

87
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,190
巴斯光年任务记录 这个星球显然是不适合居住的
Buzz Lightyear mission log. The planet is clearly uninhabitable.

88
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,730
事实上 完全是敌对的
In fact, outright hostile.

89
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,360
有知觉的叶子已经逮捕了学员弗斯-费瑟林...
The sentient foliage have apprehended cadet Furth-Feathering...

90
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,570
费瑟林斯顿...费瑟...费瑟...
Featheringston...Feather...

91
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,530
他们抓到了这个新秀
They got the rookie,

92
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,170
我强烈建议他一开始就不应该加入...
who I strongly suggested should not have joined in the first--

93
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,370
爆炸
Blast.

94
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,580
-嗡嗡声！-现在！
-Buzz! -Now!

95
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,930
快走吧 游侠！
Move it, ranger!

96
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,140
我们正在返回船上的路上
Making our way back to the ship.

97
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,690
来吧 巴兹！
Come on, Buzz!

98
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,730
快点！
Hurry!

99
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,360
引擎室一切正常
All good at the engine room.

100
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,530
-我来掌舵 -而且我将--
-I'll take the helm. -And I will--

101
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,820
什么都不做 我有了这个
Do nothing. I've got this.

102
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,300
有什么需要我协助的吗？
How may I assist you?

103
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,210
自动导航仪
Autopilots.

104
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,880
-有什么我可以做的吗 先生？-没有 也没有！
-Is there anything I can do, sir? -No and no!

105
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,050
这不是一个模拟
This is not a simulation.

106
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,680
指挥官 状态！
Commander, status!

107
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,680
燃油投入
Fuel engaged.

108
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,890
所有系统运行
All systems go.

109
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,610
警告 发射弹道不健全
Warning. Launch trajectory unsound.

110
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,440
快来吧 来吧 来吧
Come on. Come on.

111
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,660
碰撞迫在眉睫
Collision imminent.

112
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,160
弃权 终止
Abort. Abort.

113
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,620
光年船长 你需要我的帮助吗？
Captain Lightyear, do you need my help?

114
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,250
-不需要 -你确定吗？
-Negative. -Are you sure?

115
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,960
我是巴斯光年 我总是很确定
I'm Buzz Lightyear. I'm always sure.

116
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,070
我是巴斯光年 我一直都很确定
s.ub by su.b .T

117
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,460
情况很糟 巴斯
It's bad, Buzz.

118
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,510
超速水晶被完全摧毁了
The hyper-speed crystal was totally destroyed.

119
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,430
长话短说：我们被放逐了
Long story short: we're marooned.

120
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,300
我不知道
I don't know.

121
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,390
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

122
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,770
我在把自己送上军事法庭
I'm court-martialing myself.

123
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,940
不 你不可以
No. You're not.

124
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,530
霍桑指挥官 我特此解除自己所有太空游侠的职责
Commander Hawthorne, I hereby relieve myself of all Space Ranger duties.

125
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,110
这是我的错 而这些人应该得到更好的待遇
This was my fault. And these people deserve better.

126
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,860
你可以把我关进牢房
You can throw me in the brig.

127
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,410
完成任务 巴兹
Finish the mission, Buzz.

128
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,620
这就是我们所做的
That's what we do.

129
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,120
我们要等到所有人都回家了才算完成任务
We're not done until everyone gets home.

130
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,750
但我们没有燃料晶体
But we have no fuel crystal.

131
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,750
所以我们在这个星球上开采资源 创造一个新的晶体
So we mine resources on this planet, create a new crystal.

132
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,630
水晶核聚变是非常不稳定的
Crystalic fusion is highly unstable.

133
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,750
然后我们测试它
Then we test it.

134
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,630
不 这太危险了
No. It's too dangerous.

135
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,010
制造一种能够超速运转的晶体
Manufacturing a crystal capable of hyper-speed

136
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,380
就像试图用太阳套索一样
is like trying to lasso with the sun.

137
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,680
然后需要有人把太阳连接到飞船上
And then someone would need to attach that sun to a ship,

138
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,980
然后这艘船需要有人来驾驶它而不把自己炸成碎片
and then the ship needs someone to fly it without blowing themselves into oblivion.

139
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,020
谁在他们的头脑中会...
Who in their right mind would...

140
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,360
巴斯光年任务日志 星际日期3902
Buzz Lightyear mission log. Star date 3902.

141
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,800
在被放逐了一整年之后
After a full year of being marooned,

142
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,040
我们的专业人员
our specialized crew

143
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,040
已经把这个星球的大量资源用到了不可思议的地方
have put this planet's vast resources to incredible use.

144
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,590
终于 我们的第一次超速试飞开始了
Finally, our first hyper-speed test flight is a go.

145
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,520
准备好了吗 光年船长？
Ready, Captain Lightyear?

146
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,070
我已经准备好了 霍桑指挥官
Ready as I'll ever be, Commander Hawthorne.

147
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,230
准备好了
To infinity.

148
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,490
还有更远
And beyond.

149
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,370
-嗡！-我们在外围有一个缺口
-Buzz! -We got a breach in the perimeter.

150
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,660
来吧 我只是...
Come on, I just...

151
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,660
光年队长！
Captain Lightyear!

152
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,120
飞行员迪亚兹
Airman Diaz.

153
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,500
孩子们 今天的籐蔓有点凶猛 是吧？
Boy, the vines are a little feisty today, huh?

154
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,670
我们准备好发射了吗?
Are we ready to launch?

155
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,590
如果你准备好了 我们都准备好了 先生
We're all ready if you are, sir.

156
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,930
一年的努力换来四分钟的飞行 这不是很了不起吗？
A year of work for a four minute flight. Isn't that something?

157
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,090
当然是
Sure is.

158
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,760
好吧 让我们去看看这个新的超速燃料是否稳定
Well, let's go find out if this new hyper-speed fuel is stable.

159
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,810
这样我就可以让我们离开这块石头了
So I can get us off this rock.

160
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,390
我差点忘了 这是你的I. V. A. N 先生
I almost forgot. Here's your I.V.A.N, sir.

161
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,600
满载
Fully loaded.

162
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,190

163
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,770
当然 这里是XL -01
And here, of course, is the XL-01.

164
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,940
相当不错的旅程
Pretty sweet ride.

165
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,780
现在让我们给你的燃料晶体
Now let's get you that fuel crystal.

166
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,990
早上好 光年船长
Good morning, Captain Lightyear.

167
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,910
这是你特别配制的混合燃料
Here is your specially formulated fuel mixture.

168
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,000
那么 这就是能达到超速的燃料？
So, this is the fuel that's gonna reach hyper-speed?

169
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,630
它有87.6%的机会
It has an 87.6 percent chance.

170
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,380
我愿意接受这个概率
I'll take those odds.

171
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,090
祝你好运 船长
Good luck, Captain.

172
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,050
我们都指望着你...
We're all counting on you...

173
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,510
飞行员

175
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,990
收到 XL -01
Copy, XL-01.

176
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,110
我准许你在四分钟内离开地球
I'm gonna grant you four minutes to be off planet,

177
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,110
但你要马上回来找我们
but then you come right back to us.

178
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
这是个命令
That's an order.

179
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,450

Ready the flight plan, please, I.V.A.N.

193
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,840
当然可以
Certainly.

194
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,090
你的任务是加速穿越深空
Your mission is to accelerate through deep space,

195
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,220
绕过阿尔法-特卡尼的弹弓
slingshot around Alpha T'Kani,

196
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,010
然后通过减速环回到塔卡尼主星这里
then through the deceleration rings back here to T'kani Prime.

197
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,430
目标飞行时间： 4分28秒
Target flight time: 4 minutes, 28 seconds.

198
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,890
XL-01 你可以进行超级发射了
XL-01, you are clear for hyper-launch.

199
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,350
收到 控制 启动超速发射
Copy, control. Initiating hyper-launch.

200
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,960
接近50%的超速
Approaching 50 percent hyper speed.

201
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,300
燃料稳定
Fuel stable.

202
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,720
将速度提高到0.6c
Increasing speed to 0.6c.

203
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,850
百分之六十的超速

208
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,460
推进到超速
Pushing to hyper-speed.

209
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,630
发动机1发生故障
Failure in Engine 1.

210
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,800
燃料电池不稳定

211
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:08,760
I.V.A.N. 状态：
I.V.A.N., status.

212
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,260
轨迹错误 加四度
Trajectory error, plus four degrees.

213
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,930
如果不纠正航向将导致错过星环
Failure to course-correct will result in missing the rings.

214
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,190
我们会飞向深空
We'll fly off into deep space

215
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,600
导致必死无疑
resulting in certain death.

216
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,020
是的 谢谢你
Yes, thank you.

217
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,770
弹射是你唯一的选择
Ejection is your only option.

218
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,730
不 不 我可以做到
No, no. I can do it.

219
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,110
警告： 你有26秒的时间来纠正航线
Warning. You have 26 seconds to course-correct.

220
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,410
你现在有25秒的时间来纠正航向
You now have 25 seconds to course-correct.

221
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,160
-你现在有-- -请停止计数
-You now have-- -Stop counting, please.

222
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,620
我很抱歉 我的安全协议禁止我终止倒计时
I'm sorry. My safety protocols prohibit me from terminating countdown.

223
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,830
自动控制装置
Autopilots.

224
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,710
任务失败在即 请记录你的遗言
Mission failure imminent. Please record your last words.

225
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,750
今天不行 I.V.A.N.
Not today, I.V.A.N.

226
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,880
如果你对这个录音感到满意 请说话或选择1
If you are satisfied with this recording, speak or select 1.

227
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,720
I.V.A.N. 把引擎推到最大 最大功率
I.V.A.N., push the engines all the way. Maximum power.

228
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,850
这种行动是不可取的 燃料电池引爆 --
That action is inadvisable. Fuel cell detonation--

229
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,970
这正是我所期待的
Is exactly what I'm counting on.

230
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,020
情况危急
Situation critical.

231
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,900
燃料电池接近峰值容量
Fuel cell approaching peak capacity.

232
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,440
打开燃料门 I. V. A. N.
Open up the Fuel Door, I.V.A.N.

233
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,150
我很抱歉 我没有完全听清
I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch that.

234
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,610
-请重述你的命令 -打开燃料门！
-Please restate your command. -Open fuel door!

235
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,620
五分钟后引爆...
Detonation in five...

236
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,660
...四...
...four...

237
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,990
...三...
...three...

238
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,410
...二...
...two...

239
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,450
-... ...一 -现在！
-...one. -Now!

240
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,430
航线已纠正
Course corrected.

241
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,220
你没能达到超速
You failed to reach hyper-speed.

242
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,890
我不需要听到这个 I. V. A. N.
I didn't need to hear that, I.V.A.N.

243
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,020
你没听到？
You didn't hear that?

244
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,180
哦 我很抱歉 我再重复一遍
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll repeat.

245
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,640
-不 我听说--我是说-- -你没能达到超速
-No, I've heard-- I meant-- -You failed to reach hyper-speed.

246
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:41,850
-谢谢你 I. V. A. N. -你没能达到--
-Thank you, I.V.A.N. -You failed to reach--

247
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,090
指挥官 你还好吗？
Commander, are you okay?

248
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,260
迪亚兹 你长出了胡子
Diaz, you grew a beard.

249
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,630
你是怎么长出胡子的？
How did you grow a beard?

250
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,840
哦 对了
Oh, right.

251
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,640
首先 欢迎回来
First of, welcome back.

252
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,850
其次...
Secondly...

253
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:16,970
等等
Wait.

254
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,350
等等 这是什么？
Wait, what is this?

255
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,970
我离开多长时间了？
How long was I gone?

256
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,150
4年2个月零3天
Four years, two months and three days.

257
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,730
什么？
What?

258
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,060
我以为我们已经失去了你 巴兹
I thought we've lost you, Buzz.

259
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,400
艾莉莎 发生了什么事？
Alisha, what happened?

260
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,610
-时间膨胀 -什么？
-Time dilation. -What?

261
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,650
时间膨胀很简单
Time dilation is quite simple.

262
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,700
当你接近超速时 你的时间相对于我们的时间就变慢了
As you approached hyper-speed, your time slowed relative to our own.

263
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,200
所以 在你的任务中 你的年龄只有几分钟
So, during your mission you aged only minutes,

264
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,250
而我们其他人却老了很多年
while the rest of us have aged years.

265
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,040
简单地说：你飞得越快 --
Simply put: The faster you fly--

266
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,590
我飞得越快 我就越能穿越到未来
The faster I fly the further into the future I travel.

267
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,880
我明白了
I get it.

268
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,510
那么 我们现在要做什么呢？
So, what are we gonna do now?

269
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,800
我不知道
I don't know.

270
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,390
但我认为我们应该暂停更多的测试飞行
But I think we should hold off on any more test flights

271
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,430
直到我们想出别的办法
until we've figured out something else.

272
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,730
指挥官 我们说完成任务
Commander, we said finish the mission.

273
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,100
这就是太空游侠的工作
That's what Space Rangers do.

274
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,690
以什么为代价 巴兹？
At what cost, Buzz?

275
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,310
你愿意再损失四年时间吗？
Are you willing to lose another four years?

276
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,950
所以 大家只是被困在这里
So, everyone is just stuck here

277
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,120
因为我
because of me.

278
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,300
嘿 你没事吧？
Hey, you all right?

279
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,050
是的 是的 我很好
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

280
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,430
等等 那是什么？
Wait, what's that?

281
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,850
哦 我订婚了
Oh, I got engaged.

282
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,850
哦 哇 那真是太好了 她叫什么名字？
Oh, wow. That's great. What's her name?

283
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,640
Kiko 她是科学小组的成员之一
Kiko. She's one of the science crew.

284
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,720
有趣的是 如果我们没有被搁浅 这根本就不重要
It's funny, it never would've mattered if we hadn't been stranded.

285
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,110
你和你刚认识的人订婚了？
You got engaged to someone you just met?

286
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,030
巴斯 我三年前就认识她了
Buzz, I met her three years ago.

287
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,400
哦 对 对
Oh, right. Right.

288
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,870
好吧 恭喜你 我很想见见她
Well, Congratulations. I'd love to meet her.

289
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,870
嗯 有足够的时间 休息一下吧
Well, there's plenty of time for that. Get some rest.

290
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,290
这是个命令
That's an order.

291
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,420
不客气！艾莉莎
YOU'RE WELCOME! ALISHA

292
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:27,640
你好 巴兹！
Hello, Buzz!

293
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,480
我是索克斯 你的私人伴侣机器人
I am Sox. Your personal companion robot.

294
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,570
我的什么？
My what?

295
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,940
我是星际指挥部派来的
I was issued by star command

296
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,110
来缓解你离开后的情绪变化
to ease your emotional transition after your time away.

297
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,950
哦 你考虑得真周到 机器猫
Oh, that's very considerate of you, robot feline.

298
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,330
不过不用了 谢谢你
But no thank you.

299
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,240
恐怕这是规定
I'm afraid it's protocol.

300
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,410
传感器显示你已经错过了四个生日
Sensors indicate you've missed four birthdays.

301
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,500
你想要一个磨砂零食套装来庆祝吗？
Would you like a frosted snack kit to celebrate?

302
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,290
不用了 那会影响到我的营养计划
Negative. That would compromise my nutritional regiment.

303
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,970
我们可以谈一谈你的感受 我是一个优秀的倾听者
We can talk about your feelings. I am an excellent listener.

304
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,260
不 不 听着 我有一个非常漫长的... ... 一天？
No, no. Look, I've had a very long... day?

305
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,720
它没有按计划进行
It did not go as planned.

306
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,770
任务不成功？
The mission was unsuccessful?

307
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,350
肯定的
Affirmative.

308
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,980
哦 不 我很抱歉听到这个消息
Oh, no. I am so sorry to hear that.

309
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,940
谢谢你 索克斯
Thank you, Sox.

310
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,400
不客气 巴兹
You're welcome, Buzz.

311
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,980
我们玩个游戏好吗？
Shall we play a game?

312
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,400
-不 谢谢你 -你确定吗？
-No, thank you. -Are you sure?

313
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,950
我可以根据你确切的性格特征 专门为你创造一个游戏
I can create a game specifically for you, based on your exact personality profile.

314
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,580
嘿 听着 索克斯 夥计 我很累了
Hey, listen, Sox, buddy, I'm pretty tired.

315
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,250
所以 我要先去打架了
So, I'm gonna go ahead and hit the rack.

316
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,960
当然了
Of course.

317
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,960
如果你愿意 我可以提供睡眠声音
I can provide sleep sounds if you like.

318
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,630
我有几个选择
I have several options.

319
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,260
夏天的夜晚 海洋的天堂 鲸鱼的叫声
Summer night, ocean ​​paradise, whale calls.

320
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,260
不 不 白噪音就可以了
No, no. White noise is fine.

321
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,430
很好
Very well.

322
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,140
-晚安 索克斯 -晚安 巴兹
-Good night, Sox. -Good night, Buzz.

323
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,650
拉起来
Pull up.

324
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,480
光年船长 你需要帮助吗？
Captain Lightyear, do you need help?

325
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,650
不 我可以的
No. I can do it.

326
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,820
巴斯 你确定吗？
Buzz, are you sure?

327
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,320
恐怕这是规定
I'm afraid it's protocol.

328
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,690
我可以的！
I can do it!

329
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,740
我可以做到的
I can do it.

330
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,990
审查员表示你做了个噩梦
Censors indicate you had a nightmare.

331
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,620
-你想谈谈它吗？-不愿意
-Would you like to talk about it? -Negative.

332
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,370
好的 但记住 我的任务是帮助你
Okay, but remember, my mission is to help you.

333
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,040
而且我不会放弃我的任务
And I'm not giving up on my mission.

334
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,370
是吗？
Yeah?

335
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,250
是的
Yeah.

336
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,340
你知道吗 索克斯 我也不会放弃我的任务
You know what, Sox, I'm not giving up on my mission either.

337
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,670
太好了！那我能做什么？
Great! So what can I do?

338
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,260
好吧 你为什么不和你的老鼠夥伴交往
Well, why won't you engage with your mouse buddy.

339
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,890
还有什么更有挑战性的吗？
Is there anything more challenging?

340
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,430
你想要挑战？好吧
You want a challenge? Okay.

341
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,100
我想你可以研究一下这个燃料稳定性的问题
I guess you could work on this fuel stability thing.

342
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,610
晶体聚变 当然了
Crystalic fusion. Of course.

343
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,110
我应该期待你什么时候回来？
When should I expect you back?

344
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,110
大约4年
About four years.

345
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,820
等一下 你没必要这样做
Hold on. You don't have to do this.

346
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,610
指挥官 这是我的错误
Commander, this is my mistake.

347
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,070
我需要把它纠正过来
I need to make it right.

348
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,450
好吧 但也许我们应该考虑一下这个
Okay, but maybe we should think about this.

349
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,290
考虑什么？来吧 我们是太空游侠
Think about what? Come on, we're Space Rangers.

350
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,040
我们要完成任务
We finish the mission.

351
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,580
好吧 这将是很好的再次穿上西装
Well, it would be nice to wear the suit again.

352
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,250
人们开始忘记太空游侠曾经的重要性
People are starting to forget Space Rangers ever mattered.

353
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,670
好吧 我正要解决这个问题
Well, I'm about to fix that.

354
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,130
到无限大
To infinity.

355
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,760
甚至更远
And beyond.

356
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,770
不稳定
UNSTABLE

357
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,880
40周年快乐
HAPPY 40TH ANNIVERSARY

358
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:27,930
不稳定
UNSTABLE

359
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,700
嗨 巴兹
Hi, Buzz.

360
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,000
你在一两年内回到这里...
You're back here in a year or two...

361
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,960
而且 我不会
and, well, I won't.

362
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,380
我不知道这是什么时候发生的
I don't know when it happened

363
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:10,510
但我似乎已经走了 变得很老了
but I seem to have gone and gotten very old.

364
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,180
我一直以为我们会再次成为太空游侠
I always thought we'd get to be Space Rangers again.

365
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,270
我怀念在星空中的日子
I miss being out among the stars.

366
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,360
所有的冒险
All the adventures.

367
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,030
但比起这些 我更想念
But more than any of that

368
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,240
我想念你
I missed you.

369
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,780
嗨 奶奶
Hi, Grandma.

370
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,580
嘿 亲爱的
Hey, sweetheart.

371
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,450
我给我的朋友巴斯留个口信
I'm leaving a message for my friend, Buzz.

372
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,620
太空游侠？
The Space Ranger?

373
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,710
是的
That's right.

374
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,630
他是在太空中现在
He's in space right now.

375
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,790
哇
Wow.

376
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,090
这是我的孙女 Izzy
This is my granddaughter, Izzy.

377
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,220
我也要成为一名太空游侠
I'm gonna be a Space Ranger too.

378
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,380
就像他一样？
Just like him?

379
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:50,930
就像你一样
Just like you.

380
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,680
再见 巴斯
Goodbye, Buzz.

381
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:01,230
很抱歉我不能去看你完成任务了
I'm sorry I won't be there to see you finish the mission.

382
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,570
到无限大
To infinity.

383
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,440
还有更远
And beyond.

384
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,230
敲门 敲门 对不起 打扰了 我刚刚搬进我的新...
Knock. Knock. Sorry to interrupt. I'm just moving into my new-

385
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,740
看那！真正的巴斯光年在肉体上
Look at that! The actual Buzz Lightyear in the flesh.

386
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:53,910
肯定的
Affirmative.

387
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,540
指挥官卡尔-伯恩赛德
Commander Cal Burnside.

388
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,410
我小的时候是你的一个大粉丝
I was a big fan of your when I was a kid.

389
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,580
好吧 那么我期待着与你合作 最终让我们离开这里
Well, then I look forward to working with you to finally get us out of here.

390
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,370
没有人告诉你吗？
Did no one tell you?

391
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,750
告诉我什么？
Tell me what?

392
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,170
是的
Yeah.

393
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,280
那是最后的任务 巴兹
That was the last mission, Buzz.

394
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,230
什么？
What?

395
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,430
我们决定要继续留在这里
We've decided we gonna go ahead and stay right here.

396
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,930
等等 这里？不行 这不是一个可行的选择
Wait, here? Negative, that is not a viable option.

397
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,060
现在是了 看 我们正在建造这个
It is now. See, we're building this.

398
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,100
激光防护罩
Laser shield.

399
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,520
它可以把所有的人挡在外面
It'll keep all the creeters out.

400
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,900
我们就躲在这里 用我们拥有的东西来做
And we'll just tuck right in here and make do with what we've got.

401
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,860
凑合？不 等等 但你不明白 指挥官
Make do? No. Wait. But you don't understand, Commander.

402
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,490
我还是可以做到的 我可以让我们离开这里
I can still do it. I can get us outta here.

403
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,570
老兄 你还相信这一点 真是太好了
Man, it's great you still believe that.

404
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,990
但我们很好 巴兹
But we're good, Buzz.

405
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,950
得到了激光盾牌
Got the laser shield.

406
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,750
哦 你好 巴兹
Oh. Hello, Buzz.

407
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,590
巴斯？
Buzz?

408
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,590
我有个好消息 巴兹
Well, I've got some good news, Buzz.

409
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,180
我想出了燃料的问题
I figured out the fuel problem.

410
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,600
什么？
What?

411
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,560
这是一个有趣的组合
It was an interesting combination.

If you're anything like her, you and I are gonna make--

553
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,460
-...一个伟大的团队 -...有些机器人会哭
-...a great team. -...some robots cry.

554
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,590
好吧...
Okay...

555
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,590
所以 让我尽快了解这个
So, get me up to speed on this.

556
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,180
好的 Zurg飞船大约一周前出现了
Right. The Zurg ship showed up about a week ago.

557
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,350
什么是Zurg?
What's a Zurg?

558
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,310
机器人只说这个 所以我们就叫它大船
That's the only thing the robots say, so that's what we call the big ship.

559
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:49,520
Zurg飞船到了 机器人包围了基地 然后... ...
The Zurg ship arrived, the robots surrounded the base, and then...

560
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:53,070
T'kani主城的公民们 机器人外星人袭击了
Citizens of T'kani Prime, robot aliens have attacked.

561
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,820
每个人都在周边的范围内
Everyone inside the perimeter.

562
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,860
小心！
Look out!

563
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,110
我们立即启动激光防护罩
We are activating the laser shield immediately.

564
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,620
这就是我们最后听到的消息
And that's the last we heard.

565
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,750
所有这些人 他们都指望着我
All these people, they were counting on me.

566
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,620
而现在他们被困住了
And now they're trapped.

567
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:13,750
我们试图联系他们 但没有通信 不管是内部还是外部
We've tried to reach them, but there's no communication, in or out.

568
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,920
索克斯？
Sox?

569
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,840
喵喵 她是正确的
Meow meow. She's correct.

570
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,460
你把我和你的猫对上号了吗？
Did you check me against your cat?

571
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,470
嗯 他不是你的标准猫科动物
Well, he's not your standard-issue feline.

572
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,640
事实上 索克斯是你奶奶送的礼物
Actually, Sox was a gift from your grandmother.

573
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,930
-你好 Izzy -你好 索克斯
-Hello, Izzy. -Hello, Sox.

574
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,690
嘿 那是什么声音？来吧 别弄坏我的猫
Hey, what's that noise? Come on, don't break my cat.

575
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,600
他在打呼噜 他喜欢这样
He's purring. He likes it.

576
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:32,770
索克斯 你喜欢它吗？
Sox, do you like it?

577
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,940
我喜欢
I do.

578
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,030
好吧 我希望你已经准备好行动了 因为我们需要的是一个飞行员
Well, I hope you're ready for action. Because all we needed was a pilot.

579
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,190
为了什么？
For what?

580
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,410
我有一个计划 我有一个团队
I have a plan and I have a team.

581
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,660
来吧！
Come on!

582
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,690
好了 队员们 集合了
All right, team, fall in.

583
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:20,570
我找到了一个飞行员 惊喜派对行动已经开始了
I found a pilot. Operation Surprise Party is a go.

584
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,660
我喜欢这个 一个精锐的小队 最好的中的最好的
I like this. An elite squad. The best of the best.

585
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,580
你知道 她的祖母是军团历史上最伟大的太空游侠
You know, her grandmother was the greatest Space Ranger in the history of the Corps.

586
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,040
能和你一起工作将是一种荣誉
It will be an honor to work with you.

587
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,830
来吧 聚集在一起 团队
Come on, gather round, team.

588
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:37,960
让我们回顾一下我们的目标
Let's review our objectives.

589
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,130
杀死那些机器人
Kill the robots.

590
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,300
还有不要死
And don't die.

591
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,590
"不要死 "是你每天都想做的事情
"Don't die" is just something you wanna do every day.

592
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,760
这仍然是一个目标
It's still an objective.

593
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,760
如果我可以的话 我们有一个目标
If I may, we have one objective.

594
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:49,850
我们需要把这个水晶放进萝卜里 然后离开这里
We need to put this crystal in the turnip and get outta here.

595
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,600
所以 要做到这一点 我们必须进入基地
So, to do that we have to get onto the base.

596
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,100
要做到这一点 我们必须杀死所有的机器人
To do that we have to kill all the robots.

597
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,610
要做到这一点 我们必须摧毁Zurg的飞船
To do that we have to destroy the Zurg ship.

598
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:00,570
而要做到这些 我们就必须不死
And to do any of that we have to not die.

599
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,320
德里克
DERIC

600
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,660
请允许我解释一下 "惊喜派对 "行动
Allow me to explain Operation Surprise Party.

601
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,580
它是 "雷霆之矛 "行动的一个变种
It is a variation on Operation Thunder Spear.

602
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,990
你不是因为那次行动得到了一枚奖章吗？
Didn't you get a medal for that one?

603
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,790
实际上是两枚 但是...
Two, actually, but...

604
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,160
等等 你怎么知道 "雷霆之矛 "行动？
Wait, how do you know about Operation Thunder Spear?

605
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:16,920
我读过我奶奶所有的《太空游侠》书 从头到尾
I've read all my grandma's Space Ranger books, from cover to cover.

606
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,130
两次
Twice.

607
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,410
对不起 机器人猫咪
Excuse me, robot kitty.

608
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,590
哦 对不起
Oh, sorry.

609
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:27,180
感应器显示Zurg飞船为地面上的机器人提供动力
Sensors have indicated that the Zurg ship powers the robots on the ground.

610
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,430
所以 我们飞到那里 炸毁那艘船 惊喜吧 机器人！
So, we fly up there, we blow up the ship. And surprise, robots!

611
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,720
你被烤焦了
You're toast.

612
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:34,940
然后 我们把你的水晶放进萝卜里
Then, we put your crystal in the turnip.

613
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,520
然后完成任务
And finish the mission.

614
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,820
这是个好计划 为了无限大
It's a good plan. To infinity.

615
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,690
你想让我拉你的手指吗？
Are you trying to get me to pull your finger?

616
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,860
别上当了
Don't fall for it.

617
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,490
不 不是这样的 是...
No, not like that, it was...

618
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,370
对不起 这是你奶奶和我过去常做的事
Sorry, it's a thing your grandma and I used to do.

619
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,530
恶心
Ew.

620
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,790
我... ... 我们从来没有... ... 她不是故意...
I-- We were never-- She didn't mean to...

621
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,160
总之 忘了它 继续前进
Anyway, forget it. Moving on.

622
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,390
让我们把这些弹药装到犰狳号上
Let's load these munitions into the Armadillo

623
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,790
并为战斗做好准备
and steel ourselves for combat.

624
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,590
惊喜派对行动开始了
Operation Surprise Party is on.

625
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,210
巴兹 你听到了吗？
Buzz, do you hear that?

626
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,630
我听到一些声音
I hear something.

627
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,590
你认为是机器人吗？
You think it's a robot?

628
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,100
不 我们从来没有在离基地这么远的地方见过机器人
Nah, we've never seen a robot this far from the base.

629
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,260
我什么都没听到
I don't hear anything.

630
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,140
现在我听到了
Now I do.

631
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,570
Zurg.
Zurg.

632
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,190
别担心 我们会照顾你的
Don't worry, we got you.

633
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,990
什么？
What?

634
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,450
训练用的弹药
TRAINING AMMO

635
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,540
不要害怕！少年巡逻队支持你
Fear not! The Junior Patrol has your back.

636
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,700
少年什么？
The Junior what?

637
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,040
不 是飞船！
No! The ship!

638
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,590
我明白了吗？
Did I get it?

639
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,550
很接近
Pretty close.

640
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,140
对不起 我没有受过这种武器的训练
Sorry, I'm not trained with this weapon.

641
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,090
让我重新装弹
Let me reload.

642
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,430
没受过训练？等等 你说你 "没有受过训练 "是什么意思？
Not trained? Wait, what do you mean you're "not trained"?

643
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,190
你在那里 抓住它！抓住它！
You there. Grab it! Grab it!

644
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,700
抓住什么？
Grab what?

645
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,530
我不允许处理武器
I'm not allowed to handle weapons

646
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,530
这违反了我的假释规定
the violation of my parole.

647
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,490
假释？
Parole?

648
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,240
巴兹！
Buzz!

649
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,160
伊兹！现在！
Izzy! Now!

650
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,540
不！
No!

651
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,960
好吧 新的计划
Okay, new plan.

652
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,920
新计划？旧的计划是什么？
New plan? What was the old plan?

653
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,670
我需要... 有人看到鱼叉了吗？
I need the-- Anyone seen the harpoons?

654
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,180
他们预装了一个鱼叉 但我找不到... ...
They came preloaded with a harpoon, but I can't find--

655
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,470
哦 我找到了
Oh, I found it.

656
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,350
我找到了鱼叉 我现在要重新装上它 看看这个吧
I found the harpoons. I'm gonna reload it now. Check this out.

657
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,030
我找到了吗？
Did I get it?

658
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:50,990
往左一点
A little to the left.

659
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:17,930
什么？
What?

660
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,390
我拍到了吗？
Did I get it?

661
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,650
你得到了它
You got it.

662
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:24,860
是的！
Yes!

663
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,780
轰隆隆
Boom.

664
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,560
好吧 好吧 到底是什么... ... 那是怎么...
Okay, okay. What exactly-- How did that--

665
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,730
你们是谁？
Who are you?

666
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:04,060
我们是少年巡逻队 为你服务
We're the Junior Patrol, at your service.

667
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,610
对了 我需要更多信息
Right, I'm gonna need more information.

668
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:09,650
我们是一支由自我激励的学员组成的志愿者队伍
We are a volunteer team of self-motivated cadets.

669
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,690
我们每个月在前哨站这里训练一个星期
We train one week in a month here at the outpost.

670
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:14,970
莫、达比和我是上周末机器人出现时第一个到达的人
Mo and Darby and I were the first to arrive last weekend

671
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,320
当机器人出现的时候
when the robots showed up.

672
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:19,280
因此 我们策划了 "惊喜派对行动"
So, we cooked up Operation Surprise Party.

673
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:20,870
那么 你们是菜鸟？
So, you are rookies?

674
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,460
孩子 我们很想当菜鸟 还在为这个做准备
Boy, we'd love to be rookies, still building up to that.

675
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,920
好的 你们有弹药训练吗？
Okay. Do you have munitions training?

676
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,340
-部分 -战术训练？
-Partial. -Tactical engagement?

677
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,710
-待定 -战斗经验？
-Pending. -Combat experience?

678
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,050
是的！如果你算上我们刚刚经历的机器人情况
Yes! If you count the robot situation we just went through.

679
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,880
好的 来吧 索克斯
Okay. Come on, Sox.

680
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,130
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

681
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,790
听着 你们看起来是好人
Look, you seem nice people.

682
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:40,510
我非常支持你们的训练计划
I'm very supportive of your training initiatives.

683
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,560
但我还是要继续下去 从这里开始
But I'm gonna go ahead and take it from here.

684
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,480
我们刚刚从那个机器人手里救了你
We just saved you from that robot.

685
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,600
-请问？-小莫打了一枪
-Excuse me? -Mo made the kill shot.

686
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,060
Mo很幸运
Mo got lucky.

687
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,230
非常
Very.

688
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,690
那么 如果你能给我指出另一艘飞船的方向
So, if you could just point me in the direction of another ship.

00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:56,240
在废弃的储存库里有可操作的航天器
There are operational spacecrafts at the abandoned storage depot.

690
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,610
太好了 那是哪里？

691
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,200
储存库直接与资源重组中心相邻

你将首先向南朝基地走

697

经过两个红绿灯后 你会...

698
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:18,510
等等 这是不对的 那是一个死胡同
Wait, that is not right. That is a dead end.

After two stop lights you'll take a gentle left and--

703
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,360
说吧 我又犯了一个错误
Shoot. I have made another error.

为了逃离这个星球 我必须独自摧毁一艘巨大的外星飞船
In order to flee this planet I'll have to destroy a massive alien ship alone.

而没有任何形式的援助

这不仅仅是一个名字 伊兹
It's more than just a name, Izzy.

719
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:07,730
你必须清楚地知道 --

720
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:10,160
-在任何情况下如何反应... ...你接下来会说什么
-...how to react in any sit-- -...what you gonna say next.

721

我想我有这个能力
I thought I had that one.

722
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,110

我以为这将是一个有趣的新兵训练营锻炼的事情
Me? I thought this was gonna be like a fun boot camp workout thing.

730

但事实并非如此
But it is not.

731
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,830
所以 我实际上是来这里交出我的东西的 --

我不是放弃的人
I'm not a quitter.

734
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:37,420
你是辞职了
You were quitting.

735
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:39,800
你在说什么呢？我只是去了一个不同的方向
What are you talking about? I was just going in a different direction.

736
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:41,510
是的 一个放弃者的方向
Yeah, the direction of a quitter.

737
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,850
你知道吗 我放弃了
You know what, I give up.

738
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:45,010
-你看 在你的右边...

我们到了 让我回去吧
Here we are. Let me back up.

保持警惕 保持安全

746
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,060
我要去征用这架P-32犰狳战斗机
I'm going to commandeer this P-32 Armadillo

747
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,630
然后去炸掉Zurg的船

748
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,300
那么 这只是告别？

检测到生命体

752
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,360
它们是什么？
What are they?

753
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,140
巨大的昆虫类生物
Giant insectoid organisms.

754
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,820
这座建筑似乎是某种蜂巢
The building appears to be some sort of hive.

755
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:42,910
它们有威胁吗？
Are they a threat?

756
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:44,740
传感器显示它们正在冬眠
Sensors indicate they are hibernating.

757
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:45,910
非常好

00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:47,740

那是XL -01

It's been a long time since...

761
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:52,710

00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:53,790

763

765
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:16,650
对不起 打断一下
Sorry to interrupt.

766
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:18,360
看起来你正在享受一个真正美好的时刻
Looks like you were having a real nice moment.

767
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,900
你在这里做什么？这不安全
What are you doing here? It's not safe.

768
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,400
你拿了我们卡车的钥匙
You took the keys to our truck.

769
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,570
他们在那里
There they are.

770
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,160
来吧 来吧 来吧
Come on. Come on.

771
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:30,410
-安静 -我正在努力
-Quiet. -I'm trying.

772
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,500
明白了
Got it.

773
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
-谁去... ... -去开门！
-Somebody get-- -Get the door!

774
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,710
你想说 "开门" 而我已经开门了
You were gonna say "get the door", and I got the door.

775
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:46,510
好吧 我就直说了吧 我希望这事没有发生
Well, I'm gonna be blunt here. I wish that hadn't happened.

776
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,970
我们其他人也是如此
So did the rest of us.

777
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,140
每个人都拿起武器
Everyone grab a weapon.

778
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,350
孩子 我也想 但我的假释... ...
Boy, I'd love to, but my parole--

779
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,850
作为一名星际指挥官 我授予你紧急权力
As a Star Command Officer I grant you emergency authority.

780
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,520
我们要用爆炸的方式离开这里
We're gonna blast our way outta here.

781
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:56,600
现在我们正在谈论！
Now we're talking!

782
00:46:56,770 --> 00:47:00,400
巴斯 正面攻击的生存概率是38. 2%
Buzz, the probability of survival a frontal attack is 38.2 percent.

783
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:01,730
似乎有点低
Seems a bit low.

784
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,030
那隐身模式呢？
What about Stealth Mode?

785
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,360
你怎么知道隐身模式的？
How do you know about Stealth Mode?

786
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,530
祖母和我过去一直在玩隐身模式
Grandma and I used to play Stealth Mode all the time.

787
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,300
这就像捉迷藏 但有一个转折
It was like hide-and-seek, but with a twist.

788
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:11,990
好吧 其实这是很好的想法 我将使用隐身模式来迷惑他们
Okay, well, it's actually good thinking. I'll use Stealth Mode to disorient them.

789
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,080
或者 在这里坚持我的观点
Or, and stick with me here.

790
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:17,280
我们都可以使用隐身模式 直接走出去
We could all use Stealth Mode and just walk right out.

791
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,880
你是说 你会穿上太空游侠的衣服？
You mean, you would wear a Space Ranger suit?

792
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,880
这套衣服上已经有我的名字了
This one already has my name on it.

793
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:26,720
好的
Okay.

794
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:28,510
让我们回顾一下
Let's review.

795
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,550
我去...
I'm going--

796
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,720
那边走
That way.

797
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:31,760
而你要去...
And you're going--

798
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:33,020
那边
That way.

799
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,180
好的 非常好
Okay. Very good.

800
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:36,980
看看吧 我是羽毛... 羽毛... ...
Check it out, I'm Feathers... Feathering...

801
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:39,810
哦 看 一支笔 真酷
Oh, look, a pen. Cool.

802
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,020
-你的有笔吗？-好了 注意了
-Does yours have a pen? -Okay, pay attention.

803
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:43,400
隐身模式是相当简单的
Stealth mode is fairly simple.

804
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:45,650
只有两个部分 你按下这个按钮--
There are just two parts. You press the button--

805
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,990
-是这个按钮吗？-我会告诉你哪个按钮
-Is it this button? -I will tell you which button.

806
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,240
-那这个按钮呢？-我很抱歉
-What about this button? -I'm sorry.

807
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,200
我们没有时间去看所有的按钮了
We're not gonna have time to go over all the buttons.

808
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:52,830
好吧 忘了这个按钮 那这个东西呢？
Okay, forget the button. What about this thing?

809
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:53,830
-它更-- -不！不！ 不！
-It's more-- -No! No!

810
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:56,120
那是投降线 你千万别拉那个
That's the surrender strand. You never pull that.

811
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,620
对于太空游侠来说 没有比这更可耻的举动了
There is no more shameful maneuver for a Space Ranger.

812
00:47:58,790 --> 00:47:59,790
打扰一下
Excuse me.

813
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,170
我是不是错过了哪个按钮是隐身模式的按钮？
Did I miss which button is the Stealth Mode button?

814
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,420
是这个按钮
It's this button.

815
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:04,630
还不行！
Not yet!

816
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,550
你按下这个按钮 然后你就从前门出去
You push this button, then you go out the front door,

817
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,510
然后我就去炸掉Zurg的船
and I'll go blow up the Zurg ship.

818
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,090
-准备好了吗？-准备好了
-Ready? -Ready.

819
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,100
不 等等 还没准备好 等一下
No, wait. Not ready. Hang on.

820
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,180
好了 搞定他们了 这将一直是尴尬的
Okay, got 'em. That would've been embarrassing.

821
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:17,730
好的
Okay.

822
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:18,980
再见了
Goodbye again.

823
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:27,280
索克斯 你抑制了我的视觉
Sox, you're inhibiting my visual.

824
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,780
对不起 这样好些了吗？
Sorry. Is this better?

825
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,780
-不对 -好吧 这个怎么样？
-Negative. -Okay, how about this?

826
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:32,740
这样如何？
How about this?

827
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:46,550
好的 我们开始吧
Okay. Here we go.

828
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,180
非常好 隐形模式按计划进行
Very good. Stealth Mode working as planned.

829
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:01,060
这真是太酷了 这些愚蠢的虫子甚至不能看到我们
This is pretty cool. These dumb bugs can't even see us.

830
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,150
嘿 虫子 嘿 虫子 虫子
Hey, bug. Hey, bug. Bug.

831
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,820
我就在这里 虫子 你看不到我吗？
I'm right here, bug. Can't you see me?

832
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,940
他不能 他根本就看不到我
He can't. He can't see me at all.

833
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,360
而且时间已经过了
And time has elapsed.

834
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,660
等等 定时器
Wait, the timer.

835
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:15,240
他们不知道定时器
They don't know about the timer.

836
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,620
你没有看到我
You don't see me.

837
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,040
等等 我可以看到你
Wait. I can see you.

838
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:21,960
我也能看到你
I can see you too.

839
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:23,920
虫子们能看到我们
The bugs can see us.

840
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,090
不 不 我投降了
No, no. I surrender.

841
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:29,200
拉！
Pull!

842
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,510
后退！后退！
Back! Back!

843
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,020
这不管用
This isn't working.

844
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,560
你必须继续前进！
You have to keep going!

845
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,600
我们必须掉头
We have to turn around.

846
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:46,690
他们正朝我们走来
They're headed right for us.

847
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,070
不 不 不要靠近那辆车！
No, no. Do not approach the vehicle!

848
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:04,210
好的！
All right!

849
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:05,830
-适应的方式 团队 -在这里交出它
-Way to adapt, team. -Give it up here.

850
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,920
你们为什么要祝贺自己？
Why are you congratulating yourselves?

851
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:10,200
因为我刚刚把我们从那种情况下山楂出来了
Because I just Hawthorned us out right outta that situation.

852
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:11,730
但你本可以做到的 如果...
But you could've made it if--

853
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:13,340
如果你告诉我们隐身模式会失效
If you had told us the Stealth Mode wears off.

854
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:14,130
好吧...
Well...

855
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:18,260
好了 大家系好安全带
Okay, everyone just strap in.

856
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:22,770
你好 我是你的...
Hello, I am your--

857
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:36,200
等一下！
Hold on!

858
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:41,950
我们要去太空吗？
Are we going to space?

859
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,580
不 我要把你放在某个地方
No, I'm gonna drop you somewhere.

860
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:49,380
这是个大漩涡 我想我需要一个袋子
That was a big swirly turn. I think I need a bag.

861
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,130
不 不 不要在车内呕吐
No, no. Do not vomit inside the vehicle.

862
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,470
我可以看到开始 那是空间
I can see starts. That is space.

863
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:54,720
现在是什么情况？
What is happening right now?

864
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,930
她害怕空间
She's afraid of space.

865
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:57,390
-什么？ -她应该是 太可怕了
-What? -She should be. It's horrible

866
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:59,510
伊兹 记住你的练习
Izzy, remember your exercises.

867
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,930
-它要来了 -不 不
-It's coming. -No, no.

868
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,060
把你的头盔接合起来 那会抓住它的
Engage your helmet. That will catch it.

869
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,770
-嗡嗡声！另一艘飞船！-伊兹 我正在努力... ...
-Buzz! Another ship! -Izzy, I'm trying--

870
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:27,670
我什么都看不见了
I can't see anything.

871
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:29,590
哦 不！地球的黑暗面
Oh, no! The dark side of the planet.

872
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:30,960
在那里！三点钟方向！
Over there! Three o'clock!

873
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,380
坚持住 这不会是件好事
Hold on. This isn't gonna be pretty.

874
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,140
大家都还好吗？
Is everyone okay?

875
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,140
我想是的
I think so.

876
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,610
索克斯 给我一份损害报告
Sox, give me a damage report.

877
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,450
请稍等
One moment, please.

878
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,040
好的 这样就好了
Okay. This is better.

879
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:04,620
这是更好吗？
Is this better?

880
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:08,500
不 显然这是更糟糕的整体 我只是意味着... 你知道...
No, obviously this is worse overall, I just meant... You know...

881
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:10,750
你怎么会害怕太空？
How are you afraid of space?

882
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:12,340
哦 这很容易
Oh, It's pretty easy.

883
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:16,170
你知道吗 如果你在外面放任自流 你就会一直朝着同一个方向前进
Did you know if you let go out there you just keep going in the same direction

884
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,340
永远 只是...
forever, just...

885
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:21,140
好吧 那你打算怎么炸掉Zurg的船？
Well, then how were you going to blow up the Zurg ship?

886
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,100
我本来是做地面支援的
I would've been ground support.

887
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,180
我知道 奶奶并不害怕太空
I know, grandma wasn't afraid of space.

888
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:28,270
不 因为她是一名太空游侠
No, because she was a Space Ranger.

889
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,940
天体恐惧症是自动取消资格的
Astrophobia is an automatic disqualification.

890
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,400
那是什么东西？
What was that thing?

891
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:34,110
-我不知道 -它还会回来吗？
-I don't know. -Is it gonna come back?

892
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:35,400
我不知道
I don't know.

893
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:37,900
但它是怎么... ... 好吧 你不知道
But how did it-- Okay, you don't know.

894
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:45,370
我已经完成了 我终于拿到了水晶 这本来应该结束的
I was done. I finally had the crystal. This was supposed to be over.

895
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,580
但我在骗谁呢？
But who am I kidding?

896
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,920
我不需要水晶
I don't need a crystal.

897
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,040
我需要一台时间机器来摆脱这种混乱
I need a time machine to get out of this mess.

898
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:54,000
评估完成
Assessment complete.

899
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,170
这有多糟？
How bad is that?

900
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:01,300
爆炸被挡热板吸收了 只造成了轻微的电气短路
The blast was absorbed by the heat shield and only caused a minor electrical short.

901
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:02,470
好的

902
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,100
那么 为了能在飞行中使用

903
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,640
犰狳需要一种特殊电容的材料
the Armadillo will require a material of specialized capacitance.

904
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:09,100
哦 就像一个电气的东西
Oh, like an electrical thingy.

905
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,270
你怎么知道的？
How do you know that?

906
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,480
我们学过这个
We learned this.

907
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,900
专门的电容 记得吗？我们上个月做了那些野外收音机？
Specialized capacitance, remember? We built those field radios last month?

908
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:17,110
哦 是的 那很有趣
Oh, yeah. That was fun.

909
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,400
是的 除了达比把她的弄乱了
Yeah, except Darby messed hers up.

910
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,570
我要把你弄得一团糟 --
I'm gonna mess you up--

911
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,570
拜讬了 我正在努力思考
Please. I'm trying to think here.

912
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:23,870
我把我的弄乱了 但我又把它修好了
I messed mine up, but then I fixed it up.

913
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:25,370
但是你弄坏了那个电脑控制台
But you broke that computer console.

914
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:27,620
我需要那个小线圈来... 那是什么？

916
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,290
嘿 说实话 这里有很多空间
Hey, honestly, there is a lot of room out here.

917
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:34,210
如果你们想回忆一下 你们可以到那边去
If you guys wanna reminisce you could go over there,

918
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,550
或者看 那里没有人想去思考
or look, there's no one trying to think over there.

919
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:38,630
我们可以到上面去
We can go up there.

920
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,800
好吧 完美
Fine. Perfect.

等等 什么？
Wait. What?

923
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:45,600
那个采矿设施会有一个控制台 对吗？
That mining facility will have a console, right?

924
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,140
那个控制台会有一个小线圈 对吗？
That console will have a little coil thing, right?

925
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:49,980
而那个小线圈的东西会有...

926
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,140
专门的电容
Specialized capacitance.

927
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:53,650
我们需要修复这艘船 对吗？
That we need to fix this ship, right?

928
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:54,650
她是对的
She's right.

929
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:01,110
做得好 这就是霍桑人的思维方式
Good job. Now that's thinking like a Hawthorne.

930
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,940
我们去拿那个零件 然后离开这里吧
Let's go get that part and get outta here

931
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,990
在那东西再次找到我们之前
before that thing finds us again.

932
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,310
哇
Whoa.

933
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:32,430
在那边
Over there.

934
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,270
好了 我们走吧
Okay, here we go.

为了修复我们的飞船 我们必须找到一些方法
In order to repair our ship we have to find some way

937
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,040
进入指挥中心并...

索克斯？
Sox?

941
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,840
需要一支笔吗？
Need a pen?

942
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,640
知道了
Got it.

不 不能再这样了
No! Not this again.

947
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:18,020
不是什么？这是什么？
Not what? What is this?

948
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:23,070
一个捕获锥 在他们来抓你之前 它能把你关起来
A capture cone. That holds you until they come and get you.

949
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,360
没有人会来救我们 他们都被困在基地里了
No one's coming to get us. They're all trapped in the base.

950
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,700
所以 我们应该离开 对吗？
So, we should just leave, right?

951
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,280
我们不能就这样离开
We can't just leave.

952
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:31,410
当然 我们可以 听我说 我们总是可以离开的
Sure we can. Take it from me, we can always just leave.

953
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,080
看 看到了吗？
Look, see?

954
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:35,620
来吧！
Come on!

955
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,920
我告诉过你
Told you.

956
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:41,250
现在 要小心 因为这些东西 --
Now, be careful, because these things--

957
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,010
如果它们碰在一起 就会结合起来
combine if they touch.

958
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:46,720
好吧 对不起 但也许如果我们两个都试一下？
All right, sorry. But maybe if we both try it?

959
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,590
那是不可能的
That's not gonna work.

960
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,010
你甚至都没试过
You haven't even tried.

961
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,390
不！
No!

962
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:53,570
喵喵
Meow.

963
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,140
是的 那没有用
Yeah, that didn't work.

964
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,640
-巴兹？-哇 坚持住
-Buzz? -Whoa, hold on.

965
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:59,940
如果我和你一起被困在那里 我对任何人都没有帮助
I'm no help to anyone if I'm stuck in there with you.

966
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,570
索克斯 你能把这些关掉吗？
Sox, can you turn these off?

967
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,610
我够不到控制装置
I can't reach the controls.

968
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,490
等等 这里的地板上有个软点
Wait, there's a soft spot in the floor here.

969
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:09,030
-也许我们可以... ... -那是我的脚
-Maybe if we could-- -That's my foot.

970
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,820
-对不起 -等等 小心！
-Sorry. -Wait, watch it!

971
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:14,700
等等 就是这个 那东西给这些东西提供了动力
Wait, that's it. That thing powers these things.

972
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:16,960
-那我们就再打一次 -等等 等一下
-Then let's hit it again. -Wait. Wait.

973
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:19,120
我们需要门是开着的
We need the door to be open.

974
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:22,290
那么我就打开这个 你猛地撞上电源
So I'll open this. You slam into the power source.

975
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,880
这些东西会消失 然后我们就可以走出去了
These things will disappear. And we'll walk right out.

976
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:25,880
-是的 先生 -好的
-Yes, sir. -All right.

977
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:26,840
准备好了吗？
Ready?

978
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:31,800
继续努力！
Keep trying!

979
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:37,810
我们只是不够重
We're just not heavy enough.

980
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,270
巴斯 我们需要你
Buzz, we need you.

981
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,730
等等 在那里？
Wait, in there?

982
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,150
但如果不成功 我就不能救你们了
But if it doesn't work I won't be able to save you.

983
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,190
你不需要救我们 你需要加入我们
You don't need to save us, you need to join us.

984
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:56,410
再来
Again.

985
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,460
再来！
Again!

986
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:10,470
不！
No!

987
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,300
走！快走！
Go! Go!

988
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:14,760
小心点！
Watch out!

989
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,060
巴斯 不要！
Buzz, no!

990
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:21,400
我们需要线圈
We need the coil.

991
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:40,790
我们得到了你
We got you.

992
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,970
哦 看 零食
Oh, look. Snacks.

993
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:54,470
有人要吃零食吗？
Anyone going for the snack?

994
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:57,850
肉类三明治
MEAT SANDWICH

995
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:06,610
这里 让我们都再充点电吧
Here. Let's all re-charge a little.

996
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,940
给你
Here you go.

997
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:17,160
嗯 这是 呃--什么--什么--
Huh, this is, uh-- What-- What's--

998
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:18,990
这里发生了什么？
What's happening here?

999
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:20,620
你的三文治有问题吗？
Something wrong with your sandwich?

1000
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:23,370
为什么肉在外面？
Why is the meat on the outside?

1001
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:25,330
因为它是一个三明治？
Because it's a sandwich?

1002
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,500
不 面包应该是在外面的
No, the bread is supposed to be on the outside.

1003
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,210
什么 比如 面包 肉 面包？
What, like, bread, meat, bread?

1004
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,550
那是太多的面包了
That's too much bread.

1005
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,800
是的 但这都是湿的
Yes, but this is all wet.

1006
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:35,010
是的 多汁的手指 那是最好的部分
Yeah. Juicy fingers. That's the best part.

1007
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:36,850
你上次吃三明治是什么时候？
When was the last time you had a sandwich?

1008
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:39,050
我不知道 一百年前 差不多吧
I don't know, a hundred years ago, give or take.

1009
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,180
只是一个 "面包 肉 面包"
Just a "bread, meat, bread."

1010
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,350
那是太多的面包了
That's too much bread.

1011
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,600
那会把你嘴里的水分都吸走的
That would just suck all the moisture out of your mouth.

1012
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,560
说得好 达比
Good one, Darby.

1013
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:47,940
哦 不！
Oh, no!

1014
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,020
索克斯！
Sox!

1015
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:51,440
醒醒吧 索克斯
Wake up, Sox.

1016
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:53,570
来吧 小家伙 回到我身边
Come on, little buddy, come back to me.

1017
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,660
求你了 索克斯 我很抱歉
Please, Sox. I'm sorry.

1018
00:58:56,490 --> 00:58:57,490
索克斯
Sox.

1019
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:01,620
你好 我需要重启
Hello. I require a reboot.

1020
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:10,670
我很抱歉 夥计们 我差点杀了索克斯
I'm sorry, guys. I almost killed Sox.

1021
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,090
我差点把我们都害死了 在那里
I almost got us all killed back there.

1022
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:16,510
嘿 听我说 这只是一个错误
Hey, listen to me, it was just a mistake.

1023
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,140
对吧 巴兹？
Right, Buzz?

1024
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:24,140
试着让自己变得更好一点
Just try to get a little better.

1025
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:31,660
听着
Listen.

1026
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:36,070
我只是...
I just...

1027
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:42,620
当我第一次去学院的时候 我并不... 你知道... 好
When I first went to the Academy I was not... you know... good.

1028
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:46,170
我每天都搞砸了
I screwed up every day.

1029
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,130
我在障碍赛中被缠住了
I got tangled in the obstacle course.

1030
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:51,920
我的手抖得厉害 无法打中目标
My hands shook so much I couldn't hit the target.

1031
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:54,760
不是指牛眼 是整个目标
Not the bulls-eye. The whole target.

1032
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:57,800
第一周后 我打算退出 因为... ...
And I was gonna quit after the first week, it was...

1033
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:00,890
显然我不是太空游侠的料
clear I was not Space Ranger material.

1034
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:02,100
真的吗？
Really?

1035
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:03,560
是的
Yeah.

1036
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:06,100
但她的祖母在我身上看到了一些东西
But her grandma saw something in me.

1037
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:10,190
所以我也开始寻找它
So I started looking for it too.

1038
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,360
重新校准
Recalibrating.

1039
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:17,110
一个损坏的文件恢复了
One corrupted file restored.

1040
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:20,120
嘿 他亮了
Hey, he's lighting up.

1041
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:23,160
-奶奶 -你好 索克斯
-Grandma. -Hello, Sox.

1042
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:25,040
我需要你帮我一个忙
I need you to do me a favor.

1043
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:29,210
我需要你照顾我最好的朋友 他的名字叫巴兹
I need you to look after my best friend. His name is Buzz.

1044
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:33,340
他现在不在 但他很快就会回来
He's away right now, but he'll be back soon.

1045
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,510
他是一名太空游侠
He's a Space Ranger.

1046
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:38,550
他要把我们都带回家 让我们都回家
He's going to get us all home. Get us all home.

1047
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:54,360
怎么了？
What's wrong?

1048
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,190
你没听到吗？
Did not you hear that?

1049
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,950
她相信我可以弥补我犯的错误
She believed I could fix the mistake I made.

1050
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:01,950
而这种信念让她失去了一切
And that belief cost her everything.

1051
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:04,700
一切？不是
Everything? No.

1052
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:08,830
她有基科奶奶 我爸爸和我 她所有的朋友
She had grandma Kiko, my Dad and me, all her friends.

1053
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:13,880
她本不应该在这里 但她在这个星球上有一个完整的生命 巴兹
She didn't meant to be here, but she had a whole life on this planet, Buzz.

1054
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:15,880
我们所有人都有
All of us had.

1055
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:18,760
除了你
Except for you.

1056
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:25,390
我们想再次成为太空骑兵 我们想成为重要人物
We wanted to be Space Rangers again. We wanted to matter.

1057
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,430
相信我 她很重要
Believe me, she mattered.

1058
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,820
你知道 这样很好
You know, it is pretty good this way.

1059
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:48,370
是吗？面包 肉 面包 你这样做了多长时间？
Yeah? Bread, meat, bread. How long did you do it like that?

1060
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:49,910
永远
Forever.

1061
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:53,540
完全充电
Fully recharged.

1062
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:54,960
来吧
Come on.

1063
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:57,710
我们去把这部分放到船上 然后离开这里
Let's go put this part in the ship and get outta here.

1064
01:01:58,300 --> 01:01:59,300
索克斯 你能照亮我们的路吗？
Sox, can you light our way?

1065
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:00,470
当然可以
Of course.

1066
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:03,310
卡嚓 卡嚓
Click click. Click click.

1067
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:06,640
我看到你了 我要抓住你 我要抓住你
I see you. I'm gonna get ya. I'm gonna get ya.

1068
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:07,590
哦 我没有得到你
Oh, I didn't get ya.

1069
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,430
-索克斯？-你去哪了？我抓住你了！
-Sox? -Where'd you go? I got you!

1070
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,850
-索克斯 -是的 对不起
-Sox. -Yeah, sorry.

1071
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:17,640
这真是令人兴奋 惊喜派对行动 我们来了！
This is exciting. Operation Surprise Party, here we come!

1072
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:20,600
等等 什么？负面的 我不能让你这样处于危险境地
Wait, what? Negative. I can't put you in harm's way like that.

1073
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:22,490
什么 你要独自完成整个任务吗？
What, are you gonna do the whole mission alone?

1074
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:23,660
我可以做到
I can do it.

1075
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:25,490
因为你有一个霍桑 就在这里
Because you got a Hawthorne right here.

1076
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:29,200
我很感激 告诉你 如果我需要你 我会让你知道
And I appreciate that. Tell you what, I'll let you know if I need you.

1077
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:33,370
但在那之前 我们先设法回到犰狳号 不要再...
But until then let's just try to get back to the Armadillo without any more--

1078
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,760
快跑！
Run!

1079
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:47,510
不！
No!

1080
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:53,230
什么？
What?

1081
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:55,150
它在追我！回到船上去！
It's after me! Go back to the ship!

1082
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:56,360
但是巴斯！
But Buzz!

1083
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,860
巴斯光年任务日志
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

1084
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,280
我被一个...
I'm being pursued by a...

1085
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,620
只是一个巨大的机器人
just a massive robot.

1086
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:12,790
我把它引开 而其他人则逃到船上去
I'm leading it away while the others escape to the ship.

1087
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:36,020
巴斯 -什么？
Buzz.

1088
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:38,230
什么 你怎么知道我的名字？
What? How do you know my name?

1089
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:40,650
跟我过来
Come with me.

1090
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:41,820
什么？
What?

1091
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:48,200
这绝对是违反了我的假释规定
This is definitely a violation of my parole.

1092
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:54,330
来吧 让我们离开这里
Come on. Let's get outta here.

1093
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:15,590
Zurg.
Zurg.

1094
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:37,750
准备好发射 惊喜派对行动又开始了
Ready yourselves for launch. Operation Surprise Party is back on.

1095
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:38,920
什么？和我们一起？
What? With us?

1096
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,580
什么？ 我一个人完成整个任务吗？
What, am I gonna do  the whole mission alone?

1097
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:44,300
我们还不能发射  我需要5分钟来安装线圈
We can't launch yet.  I need five minutes to install the coil.

1098
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,970
我们不能在这里坐5分钟
We can't sit here for five minutes.

1099
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:51,710
这艘船仍有悬停能力
The ship still has hover capabilities.

1100
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:52,620
那我们就用它们吧
Then let's use them.

1101
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:12,700
我们可能会在火焰喷泉中失去它们
We might lose them in the fire geysers.

1102
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:15,410

但我们甚至还没有完成弹药训练
But we haven't even finished  our munitions training.

1104
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,830
这能有多难？你看

1105
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:21,520
我们有这些带刺的东西  而这些东西可能会爆炸
We got these spiky things.  And these one probably explode.

1106
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:23,090
只要做任何感觉正确的事
Just do whatever feels right.

1107
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:24,670
什么？你打算怎么做？
What? What are you gonna do?

1108
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,760
我要和 "轰隆先生 "跳舞
I'm gonna dance with Mister Boom.

1109
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:35,310

1112
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:44,610
他们在追赶我们 那些喷火器在哪里？
They're gaining on us. Where are those fire geysers?

1113
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:45,770
就在前面
Dead ahead.

1114
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:47,280
别担心 我知道每一寸的...
Don't worry,  I know every last inch of--

1115
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,440

Watch out!

1116
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:00,870
这里 扔这个
Here, throw this.

我已经在模拟器上做过了
I've done it in the simulator.

1128

好吧 现在要来真的了

1141
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:21,200
当燃料电池...
when the fuel cell is--

1142
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:22,160
不！
No!

1143
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:30,920
哦 不
Oh, no.

1144

一切都发生得太快了 我...
Everything was happening so fast and I...

1151
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:26,600
我只是...
I just...

1152
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:31,730
我犯了一个错误
I made a mistake.

1153
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:34,150
是的
Yeah.

1154
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:39,410
好吧 但我们还没有完成 对吗？
Okay, but we're not done, right?

1155
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:41,620
我们仍然可以做一些事情
We can still do something.

1156
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:44,040

Izzy, look around.

1157
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,210
没有什么可做的
There is nothing to do.

1158
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:47,460
这个任务...
The mission...

1159
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:49,920
已经结束了
It's over.

1160
01:08:50,670 --> 01:08:51,790
巴斯
Buzz.

1161
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,420
巴斯！
Buzz!

1162
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:55,050
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

1163
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:58,380
我只是需要一个人静一静
I just need to be by myself.

1164
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:02,300
不！
No!

1165
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:09,560
巴斯！
Buzz!

1166
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,560
巴斯！
Buzz.

1167
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,640
这是什么...
What the...

1168
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:50,430
这是什么？我们在哪里？
What is this? Where are we?

1169
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:52,600
你是谁？
Who are you?

1170
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:54,690
这就是问题所在
Now that's the question.

1171
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,080
你看起来不错 巴兹
You look good, Buzz.

1172
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,330
爸爸？
Dad?

1173
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:10,580
再猜猜看
Guess again.

1174
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:26,470
索克斯？
Sox?

1175
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:29,310
你好 巴兹
Hello, Buzz.

1176
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:31,640
我不明白
I don't understand.

1177
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:39,150
我把这一切都搞砸了
I messed this all up.

1178
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:41,280
嘿 这只是一个错误
Hey, it was just a mistake.

1179
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:43,110
还记得你告诉我的吗？
Remember what you told me?

1180
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,070
这一次是不同的
This one's different.

1181
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,240
为什么？
Why?

1182
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:47,830
因为这是我的！
Because it's mine!

1183
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:02,590
我应该和我奶奶一样好
I'm supposed to be as good as my grandma.

1184
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:05,260
我应该是霍桑的人
I'm supposed to be a Hawthorne.

1185
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,350
但我不是
But I'm not.

1186
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:23,820
巴兹？
Buzz?

1187
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:27,160
等一下 等一下
Wait a minute, hold on.

1188
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:28,620
你不是我 我是我
You're not me. I am me.

1189
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:29,830
你现在是你
You are you now.

1190
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:32,000
但我是50年后的你
But I'm you 50 years from now.

1191
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,330
好吧 不可能有两个MES
Well, there can't be two mes.

1192
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,000
但我们都在这里
Yet here we both are.

1193
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:37,040
那么好吧 如果你是我
Okay then. If you're me.

1194
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,880
我在想一个介于1和 --
I'm thinking of a number between one and--

1195
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,630
1273.
1273.

1196
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,800
哇哦
Whoa.

1197
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:43,670
祖格
Zurg.

1198
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,090
这不是很可爱吗？
Isn't that cute.

1199
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:46,970
机器人不能完全说 "嗡嗡"
Robots can't quite say "Buzz."

1200
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:49,420
所以在这里我就叫祖格
So around here I'm just Zurg.

1201
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:50,350
扎克
Zurg.

1202
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:51,520
我想你也是
And I guess so are you.

1203
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:52,680
怎么会呢？我不明白
How? I don't understand.

1204
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,810
不要担心 这一切都不重要了
Do not worry about it. None of this is gonna matter.

1205
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:55,810
巴兹
Buzz.

1206
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:56,850
什么事？
Yes?

1207
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:58,560
你必须向他解释这一切
You have to explain it all to him.

1208
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,360
你是对的
You're right.

1209
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,820
我很抱歉 这只是令人兴奋
I'm sorry, it's just exciting.

1210
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:04,440
你终于来了
You're finally here.

1211
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:07,070
看 我也达到了超速
See, I reached hyper-speed too.

1212
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:08,950
超速
Hyper-speed.

1213
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:11,200
和你一样
Like you did.

1214
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,450
但我没有被当作英雄来迎接
But I wasn't greeted as a hero.

1215
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:20,380
不 那个新指挥官要以偷窃XL-15的罪名逮捕我
No, that new Commander was gonna  arrest me for stealing the XL-15.

1216
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:24,170
我找到了一个让他们回家的方法 而他们甚至都不在乎
I'd found a way to get them home, and they didn't even care.

1217
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,300
所以我逃了出来
So I escaped.

1218
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:34,020
我尽可能地走得远 尽可能地快
I went as far as I could, as fast as I could.

1219
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:37,940
以这种速度走了那么久 我已经走了几个世纪
At that speed for that long I'd traveled centuries.

1220
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:41,900
而我最终来到了一个你不认识的未来
And I ended up in a future you wouldn』t recognize.

1221
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:44,690
充满了你无法想像的技术
Filled with technology you can't imagine.

1222
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:47,530
就在那时 我恍然大悟
And that's when it dawned on me.

1223
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:50,950
如果我们能用这块水晶向前推进时间
If we can use this crystal  to go forward in time.

1224
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:53,370
为什么不能用它来回到过去呢？
Why not use it to go back?

1225
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:55,200
但我们不能回到过去
But we can't go back in time.

1226
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:57,160
-我们现在可以 -什么？
-We can now. -What?

1227
01:12:57,370 --> 01:13:00,330
听着 巴兹 我已经打破了时间
Listen, Buzz, I've broken time.

1228
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,510
发生在你身上的事从未发生在我身上
What's happening to you never happened to me.

1229
01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:07,050
这是个全新的现在 从来没有过的
This is a new now that's never been lived.

1230
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:09,680
你看 我们可以改变事情 巴兹
You see, we can change things, Buzz.

1231
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,890
如果我们能回到过去 我们可以阻止自己
Well, if we can go back in time  we can stop ourselves

1232
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:15,020
我们可以阻止自己降落在那个星球上
from ever landing on that planet.

1233
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:16,350
不去撞上那座山
From ever hitting that mountain.

1234
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,850
我们可以继续完成回家的任务
We can just continue the mission home.

1235
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:19,650
而这一切都不会发生
And none of this will have ever happened.

1236
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:21,730
这是个好计划
it's a good plan.

1237
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:24,400
而这个水晶是这一切的关键
And this crystal is the key to it all.

1238
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:26,030
等等 你不是已经有一个了吗？
Wait, don't you already have one?

1239
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:27,690
嗯 算是吧
Well, sort of.

1240
01:13:28,990 --> 01:13:32,410
你看 在测试时间旅行时 我把我的水晶磨光了
See, I wore my crystal out testing the time travel.

1241
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:34,740
也把自己累坏了 花了不少时间
Wore myself out too. It took a while.

1242
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:37,330
结果发现这并不是一门精确的科学
Turns out this isn't an exact science.

1243
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:40,040
这是我能得到的最远的时间了
This is as far back in time  as I could get.

1244
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:42,380
来吧 帮我配置引擎
Come on, help me configure the engine.

1245
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:43,710
它应该看起来很熟悉
It should look familiar.

1246
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:45,880
等等 这是基于萝卜吗？？
Wait, is this based on the turnip?

1247
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:47,710
把它设定为反转推进器 全速前进
Set it for reversed thrusters, full.

1248
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:51,840
那么 这些都是我们设计的？
So, we designed all of this?

1249
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:54,560
不 这都是借来的
No, this is all borrowed.

1250
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:56,430
我只是做了一些修改
I just made some modifications.

1251
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:05,320
她又可以当太空游侠了 巴兹
She'll get to be  a Space Ranger again, Buzz.

1252
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:07,990
是啊 虽然...
Yeah.

1253
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,400
虽然...
Although...

1254
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:10,400
什么？
What?

1255
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:13,530
嗯 她将不会有她的家人
Well, she won't have her family.

1256
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,160
她不会有伊兹了
She won't have Izzy.

1257
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:16,450
谁是Izzy?
Who's Izzy?

1258
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,270
听着 她不会想念任何人
Look, she's not gonna miss anyone

1259
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:22,590
如果她一开始就没有遇到他们 对吗？
if she never meets them  in the first place, right?

1260
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:27,550
人们唯一会知道的是我们完成了我们的任务
The only thing people are gonna know  is that we finished our mission.

1261
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:31,220
给你 把你的水晶递给我
Here. Hand me your crystal.

1262
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:35,140
巴兹？
Buzz?

1263
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:37,600
我不知道 也许...
I don't know, maybe...

1264
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:39,520
也许我们应该考虑一下这个
maybe we should think about this.

1265
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,060
考虑什么？
Think about what?

1266
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:44,440
霍桑指挥官相信我们可以弥补我们犯下的这个错误
Commander Hawthorne believed  we could fix this mistake we made.

1267
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:47,320
而这种信念使她失去了一切
And that belief cost her everything.

1268
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:50,360
哦 不 不 我们完全搞错了
Oh, no, no. We had that all wrong.

1269
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:52,240
她在下面有一个完整的生活
She had a whole life down there.

1270
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,910
什么样的生活？
What kind of life?

1271
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:57,080
我们应该是太空游侠
We're supposed to be Space Rangers.

1272
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:59,330
我们应该是重要的
We suppose to matter.

1273
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,540
你不会想这样生活的 巴兹
You don't wanna live like this, Buzz.

1274
01:15:02,710 --> 01:15:05,830
在同样的恶梦中醒来
Waking up with that same nightmare.

1275
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,340
被你的错误所困扰
Haunted by your mistake.

1276
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,880
但你终于可以放手了
But you can finally let go of that.

1277
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,010
从现在开始
Starting right now.

1278
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:16,510
你是对的
You're right.

1279
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,010
我可以
I can.

1280
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:21,890
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

1281
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,520
你和我 我们是不一样的
You and me, we're not the same.

1282
01:15:25,190 --> 01:15:26,770
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1283
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:28,110
不 巴兹
No, Buzz.

1284
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:30,110
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1285
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,290
嘿 猫
Hey, cat.

1286
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:45,870
你知道怎么开这个东西吗？
Do you know how to fly this thing?

1287
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,330
没有燃料了
There's no fuel.

1288
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:50,420
你看 这就是为什么我们不应该在我们的头顶上得到
See, this is why we should  never have gotten in over our heads.

1289
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:51,510
你想做什么？
What did you wanna do?

1290
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:53,220
在前哨站等着机器人找到我们？
Wait at the outpost  until the robots found us?

1291
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:55,010
这总比被困在这里好吧？
That's better  than being stranded out here.

1292
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,510
总比被困在没有人会找到我们的地方要好
where no one's ever gonna find us.

1293
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:59,980
你是我最不想在生死关头与之为伍的人
You are the last person I wanna be  stuck with in a life-and-death situation.

1294
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:01,270
好吧 你很幸运 好吗？
Well, you're in luck. Okay?

1295
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:03,640
因为看看周围  这只是一个死亡的情况
Cause look around.  This is just a death situation.

1296
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:05,560
喵喵
Meow meow.

1297
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:08,650
我已经完全失去了巴兹
I've completely lost Buzz.

1298
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:11,070
他离得太远了 无法追踪
He's too far away to track.

1299
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:28,920
各位 进去！
Everybody, inside!

1300
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:29,920
什么？
What?

1301
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,550
快进船舱
Get inside the ship.

1302
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:36,260
现在是什么在追我们？
What's after us now?

1303
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:37,430
我们没有任何武器了
We don't have any more weapons.

1304
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:38,930
没事了 我们要离开这里了
It's okay. We're getting out of here.

1305
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:40,170
我们要去哪里？
Where are we going?

1306
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:41,760
我们要进入太空
We're going into space.

1307
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:47,190
嘿 放开我 不！
Hey, let go of me. No!

1308
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,650
我不明白这里发生了什么 巴兹
I don't understand  what's happening here, Buzz.

1309
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:53,530
你已经改变了
You've changed.

1310
01:16:53,690 --> 01:16:55,690
而且不是往好的方面发展
And not for the better.

1311
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:56,860
不！
No!

1312
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:59,820
你不能这样做  你要把这一切都抹掉
You can't do this.  You're gonna erase it all.

1313
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:01,450
是的
Exactly.

1314
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:04,370
不 你会夺走一切
No, you gonna take away everything.

1315
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:06,910
人们的家庭 他们的朋友
People's families, their friends.

1316
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,500
我的朋友
My friends.

1317
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,670
他们在那个星球上有自己的生活
They have lives on that planet.

1318
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:12,290
每个人都是如此
Everyone does.

1319
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:14,090
除了我们
Except for us.

1320
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:18,050
我几乎认不出你 巴兹
I hardly recognize you, Buzz.

1321
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:21,050
所有这些新的想法...
All these new ideas...

1322
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,760
你知道吗？
You know what?

1323
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,970
我们把这些也删掉吧
We'll go ahead and erase those too.

1324
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,810
-哇哦 -我给你买了5分钟
-Whoa. -I bought you five minutes.

1325
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:29,940
为什么？
Why?

1326
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,310
我喜欢这个新的你
I like this new you.

1327
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:34,980
我们必须摧毁这艘船
We have to destroy this ship.

1328
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,530
你能把我带到舰桥吗？
Can you get me to the bridge?

1329
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:37,780
当然可以 跟着我
Certainly. Follow me.

1330
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:45,950
祖格
Zurg.

1331
01:17:49,710 --> 01:17:52,000
惊喜派对行动 我们开始吧
Operation Surprise Party, here we go.

1332
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,180
Zap, zap!
Zap, zap!

1333
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,670
我们需要保护我们的逃生船
We need to protect our escape ship.

1334
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,670
所以 不要让任何机器人从那扇门进来
So, don't let any robots come through that door.

1335
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,050
别担心 我们会把它封住的
Don't worry, we'll seal it off.

1336
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:00,220
你去找巴兹
You go find Buzz.

1337
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:01,760
我会追踪他狗牌上的芯片
I'll track the chip in his dog tags.

1338
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:03,100
喵喵
Meow meow.

1339
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:05,310
怎么了？
What's wrong?

1340
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,060
我收到两个巴斯的信号 这不可能是正确的
I'm getting two Buzz signals. That's can't be right.

1341
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:10,690
我将进行三角定位  这将使我们足够接近 来吧
I'll triangulate.  That will get us close enough. Come on.

1342
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:13,270
一条回去的捷径
A shortcut back.

1343
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:22,740
这是很好的
This is pretty neat.

1344
01:18:22,910 --> 01:18:23,700
我们得走了
We have to go.

1345
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:24,870
是的 好的
Yep, all right.

1346
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:34,210
哦 太好了
Oh, great.

1347
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:36,170
我不知道这些控制
I don't know any of these controls.

1348
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:37,380
等等 I. V. A. N. ？
Wait. I.V.A.N.?

1349
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:38,420
是的 上尉？
Yes, Captain?

1350
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:40,380
孩子 我很高兴见到你
Boy, am I glad to see you.

1351
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:42,760
两分钟后启动自毁程序
Initiate self-destruct sequence  in two minutes.

1352
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:45,550
你说对了 自毁倒计时开始
You got it. Self-destruct countdown initiated.

1353
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,220
巴斯 你不想要这些很酷的技术吗？
Buzz, you don't want  any of this cool technology?

1354
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:49,980
只有你 夥计 来吧
Only you, buddy, come on.

1355
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,810
-叛徒！-不
-Traitor! -No.

1356
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:54,900
够了！
Enough!

1357
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,820
只要告诉我水晶在哪里
Just tell me where the crystal is.

1358
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:02,610
好吧 我们得保护我们的逃生船
Okay, we've gotta protect our escape ship.

1359
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,110
那么 我们如何关闭这扇门呢？
So, how do we close this door?

1360
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,200
我不知道
I don't know.

1361
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,690
你说 "别担心 我们会把它封住的 "
What? You said, "don't worry we'll seal it off."

1362
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:08,620
对 所以别担心 我们会的
Right, so don't worry. We will.

1363
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:10,910
在这里 我们走了
Here we go.

1364
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:12,580
看 看到了吗？
Look, see?

1365
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:13,920
什么？
What?

1366
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:21,380
喵喵喵
Meow meow.

1367
01:19:21,550 --> 01:19:23,130
现在信号更紧了
The signal is tighter now.

1368
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,510
他必须在这边直走
He has to be straight this way.

1369
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,220
那是一个很大的空间
That's a lot of space.

1370
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:30,350
保持在一起 保持在一起
Keep it together. Keep it together.

1371
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:32,310
不！
No!

1372
01:19:33,730 --> 01:19:36,860
我不明白  信号显示巴兹在50米外
I don't understand.  The signal says Buzz is 50 meters away.

1373
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:39,690
他在那边
He's over there.

1374
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,990
你以为我们不一样吗 巴斯？
You think we're not the same, Buzz?

1375
01:19:43,150 --> 01:19:46,160
你已经是我了 只是你还不知道
You're already me, you just don't know it yet.

1376
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,740
我永远不会成为你！
I'm never gonna be you!

1377
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:51,250
如果你不成为我 你就不会成为任何人
If you're not gonna be me  you're not gonna be anyone.

1378
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,790
人工重力解除
Artificial gravity disengaged.

1379
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,170
爆炸
Blast.

1380
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:00,090
不 不
No, no.

1381
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:07,300
-嘿 你在做什么？-造一个炸弹
-Hey, what are you doing? -Building a bomb.

1382
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:08,550
不错 你需要笔吗？
Nice, do you need a pen?

1383
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:09,640
不 给你
No. Here.

1384
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:11,850
哦 谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

1385
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:13,520
薄荷糖
Peppermint.

1386
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:14,730
把包装纸给我
Give me the wrapper.

1387
01:20:14,890 --> 01:20:17,190
那么 你就可以用这些东西造一个炸弹了？
So, you can just build a bomb  out of that stuff?

1388
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,860
我用得少  现在把口香糖给我
I worked with less.  Now give me the gum.

1389
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:21,020
等等 我还没说完 还有很多味道
Wait, I'm not done,  there's still a lot of flavor left.

1390
01:20:21,190 --> 01:20:22,190
来吧！
Come on!

1391
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:26,280
在那里 当他们踩到它的时候 它就会炸开
There. When they step on it  it will blow up.

1392
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:27,530
如果他们不踩呢？
What if they don't step on it?

1393
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:29,660
我是说 我不会踩上去的 你会吗？
I mean, I wouldn't step on that,  would you?

1394
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:32,830
那我们就得往上面扔重物
Then we need to drop something heavy on it.

1395
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:40,880
-只是要... -不！
-Just gonna... -No!

1396
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:51,720
巴兹？
Buzz?

1397
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:53,100
巴斯？ 巴斯！
Buzz!

1398
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:54,270
阿丽莎？
Alisha?

1399
01:20:55,730 --> 01:20:57,270
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

1400
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:02,980
不 我一个人做不到 我需要帮助
No. I can't do it alone. I need help.

1401
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:06,480
我不是我奶奶
I'm not my grandma.

1402
01:21:06,650 --> 01:21:11,070
伊兹 我不需要你的奶奶 我需要你
Izzy, I don't need your grandma,  I need you.

1403
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:14,910
索克斯 我们怎么去那里？
Sox, how do we get over there?

1404
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,080
通过气闸
Through the airlock.

1405
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:18,330
通过那里？
Through there?

1406
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,630
外面什么都没有
There's nothing out there.

1407
01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:21,590
正是如此 没有东西挡住你的路
Exactly. Nothing in your way.

1408
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:23,210
你就直接过去吧
You just go straight across.

1409
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:24,380
不！
No!

1410
01:21:27,170 --> 01:21:28,720
让我把话说清楚 当这东西落在你的炸弹上时
Let me get this straight,  when this falls on your bomb

1411
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:29,970
-它一定会爆炸的 -是的
-it will definitely explode. -Yes.

1412
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:31,140
-那就能封住门？-是的
-And that will seal the door? -Yes.

1413
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:32,850
但是我们最好快点
But we better hurry.

1414
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:34,220
我正在抓紧时间
I am hurrying.

1415
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:36,480
你为什么不快点呢？
Why don't you hurry?

1416
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:39,060
来吧
Come on.

1417
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:52,370

Oh, man.

1421
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:06,000
哦 不
Oh, no.

1422
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:10,720
只要不往下看 也不往上看  这都是空间
Just don't look down, or up.  It's all space.

1423
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,220
它无处不在 在你周围
It's everywhere. All around you.

1424
01:22:13,930 --> 01:22:15,850
我很抱歉 我可能没有帮助
I'm sorry, I'm probably not helping.

1425
01:22:16,010 --> 01:22:17,220
只管直走
Just go straight.

1426
01:22:17,930 --> 01:22:20,770
一旦你推开了 你就会走到那个方向
Once you push off  that the direction you'll go.

1427
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:23,110
但如果我错过了呢？
But what if I miss?

1428
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:24,860
不要错过
Don't miss.

1429
01:22:58,270 --> 01:22:59,220
什么？哦 不
What? Oh, no.

1430

1431
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:10,490

1433
01:23:19,490 --> 01:23:20,500
谢谢你 Izzy
Thank you, Izzy.

1434
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,220
没有办法进去
There is no way in.

1435
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:38,640
也许我可以帮忙
Perhaps I could help.

1436
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,610
你不能为我躲起来 巴兹
You can't hide for me, Buzz.

1437
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:50,820
这就像躲避自己
It's like hiding from yourself.

1438
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:52,860
我总会找到你的
I'll always find you.

1439

手动超控启动
Manual override activated.

1440
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:34,900

来吧 让我们离开这里！

1442
01:24:43,290 --> 01:24:44,410
我们必须炸毁这艘船
We have to blow up the ship.

1443
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:46,000
没有时间了 我们不可能成功的
There's no time. We'll never make it.

1444
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:47,670
哦 是的 我们会的
Oh, yes, we will.

1445

1448
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:06,890
达比 我们必须投降
Darby, we have to surrender.

1449
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:09,230
不 我不会放弃的

1450
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,520
是的 我也是 坚持住

巴斯光年任务记录

我们已经摧毁了扎克的飞船和扎克本人
We've destroyed the Zurg's ship and Zurg himself.

1456
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:28,270
现在我只需要追上犰狳号 以便...
Now I just have to catch up  to the Armadillo in order to--

1457
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:31,190

Going somewhere?

1458
01:26:32,350 --> 01:26:34,650
警告 引擎损坏是灾难性的

1463
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:52,930
你会像你从来没有来过一样

准备好去死吧
Prepare to die.

1465
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:03,430
今天不行 祖格
Not today, Zurg.

1466
01:27:12,230 --> 01:27:14,230
我们已经进入了这个星球的引力范围
We've entered  the planet's gravitational pull.

1467
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:15,360
我们会坠毁吗？
Are we gonna crash?

1468
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:16,650
恐怕是的
I'm afraid so.

1469
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:31,290
巴兹！
Buzz!

1470
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:46,220
我做不到
I can't do it.

1471
01:27:46,390 --> 01:27:48,220
巴斯 没关系的
Buzz, it's okay.

1472
01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:49,220
我们可以
We can.

1473
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:51,850
你能保持船的稳定吗？
Can you keep the ship steady?

1474
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:53,850
是的 我想可以
Yeah. I think so.

Okay, Sox, fuse the emergency battery the power of flight controls.

1476
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:02,900
明白了
Got it.

1477
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:04,990
我需要一个副驾驶
I'll need a co-pilot.

1478
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:08,160
好的 但我只在模拟器上做过这个
Okay, but I've only done this  in the simulator.

1479
01:28:08,370 --> 01:28:09,950
好了 马上就要动真格的了
Well, it's about to get real.

1480
01:28:10,210 --> 01:28:12,670
记住 向后拉动操纵杆--
Remember, pull back on the yoke--

1481
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:16,920
-容易 -是的 对不起 从现在开始 漂亮而轻松
-Easy. -Yep. Sorry. Nice and easy from now on.

1482
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,090
没用的！
It's not working!

1483
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:21,840
我们进去的速度太快了
We're going in too fast.

1484
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:23,130
-I. V. A. N. -是的 船长？

-We're going too fast. -Congratulations!

1486
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:28,800
我们不需要纸屑 我们需要刹车！
We don't need confetti, we need brakes!

1487
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:29,630
哦 我知道！
Oh, I know!

1488
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:31,430
-空气刹车！-在地板上
-The air brake! -On the floor.

1489
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:32,680
达比！
Darby!

1490
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:35,350
-它被卡住了 -什么？
-It's stuck. -What?

1491
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:36,980
盖子 它被卡住了
The cover, it's stuck.

1492
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:39,110
我需要一把螺丝刀 或者一把剪子
I need a screwdriver, or a hair clipper

1493
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:40,820
某种小的楔子
Some sort of a small wedge.

1494
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:43,530
我已经拿到了笔！
I've got the pen!

1495
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:05,010
-巴兹！- 大家都还好吗？

1496
01:29:05,170 --> 01:29:06,880
-是的  -我想是的

1497
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:10,430
警察来了！大家快跑！
The cops! Everybody, run!

1498
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:13,060
等等 这只是救援队
Wait. It's just the rescue team.

1499
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:15,520
对 好的
Right. Okay.

1500
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:19,610
你看起来是个正直的公民 是什么导致了你被监禁？
You seem like a decent citizen. What led to your incarceration?

1501
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:21,360
我偷了一艘船
I stole a ship.

1502
01:29:22,570 --> 01:29:26,400
我们中谁没有在... ...相对绝望的时候偷过一艘船？
Who among us hasn't stolen a ship  in a moment of...

1503
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:28,320
相对绝望的时候？
relative desperation?

1504
01:29:28,490 --> 01:29:31,700
我是一个有资源的人 我的武器是聪明才智
I'm a man of resources. My weapon is ingenuity.

1505
01:29:31,870 --> 01:29:33,240
我可以做任何事情！
I can do anything!

1506
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:34,660
你能不在我耳边大喊吗？
Can you not shout in my ear?

1507
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:35,950
是的 对不起
Yep, sorry.

1508
01:29:46,670 --> 01:29:47,670
你还好吗？
You're okay?

1509
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,300
su.b .T
su.b .T

1510
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:50,590
我在太空中
I was in space.

1511
01:29:52,390 --> 01:29:54,220
你奶奶会很骄傲的
Your grandma would be proud.

1512
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:57,140
她也会为你感到骄傲
She'd be proud of you too.

1513
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:00,770
她总是这样
She always was.

1514
01:30:03,230 --> 01:30:05,150
等等 你的水晶在哪里？
Wait. Where is your crystal?

1515
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:06,940
它已经消失了
It's gone.

1516
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:08,820
但你的任务...

你怎么还在抱怨？
How are you still complaining?

1543
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:52,010
我是因为行为良好而被释放的 不是因为态度好

不穿裤子看起来很奇怪吗？
Does it look weird without pants?

1547

不 你看起来很好

1548

我希望我可以把它拉下来
