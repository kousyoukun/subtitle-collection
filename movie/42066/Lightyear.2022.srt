1
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:50,342
1995年，一个叫安迪的男孩过生日时得到了一个巴斯光年玩具。
In 1995, a boy named Andy got a Buzz Lightyear toy for his birthday.

2
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,889
这是他最喜欢的电影。
It was from his favorite movie.

3
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:01,645
这就是那部电影。
This is that movie.

4
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:09,945
距离地球420万光年的未知空间
UNCHARTED SPACE 4.2 MILLION LIGHT YEARS FROM EARTH

5
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:20,163
星际指挥部sc-01探索船船员人数:1200人
STAR COMMAND SC-01 EXPLORATION VESSEL CREW: 1200

6
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:45,939
巴斯光年任务日志。开始日期3901
Buzz Lightyear mission log. Star date 3901.

7
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,108
传感器已经探测到潜在的生命形式。
Sensors have detected potential life forms.

8
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,401
在一个未知的星球上。
on an uncharted planet.

9
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,612
所以我们要绕道去调查一下。
So, we're making a detour to investigate.

10
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:05,459
太空游骑兵将进行初步评估，然后评估是否值得将科研人员从过度睡眠中唤醒。
Space Rangers will make initial evaluation, then assess whether it's worth waking the science crew from their hyper-sleep.

11
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:13,217
埃里克采集核心样本的同时，我将进一步探索这颗陌生星球的奇异之处。
While the ERIC takes core samples I will explore further the oddities of this strange planet.

12
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,901
地形看起来有点不稳定。
Terrain seems a bit unstable.

13
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,612
还没有显示这片区域是否透气。
No read-out yet if the area is breathable.

14
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,865
似乎到处都没有智慧生命的迹象。
There seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere.

15
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,742
-你在跟谁说话?-不。
-Who are you talking to? -No one.

16
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,160
你又在说话了。
You were narrating again.

17
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,913
我不是。在做任务日志。
I was not. Just doing the mission log.

18
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,249
你知道没人会听他们的。
You do know no one ever listens to them.

19
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,793
我知道，叙述能帮助我集中注意力。
I know that, narrating helps me with focus.

20
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,545
保持锋利。-是的。
-Stay sharp. -Yeah.

21
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,964
如果你不介意的话，霍桑指挥官。
Well, if it bothers you, Commander Hawthorne.

22
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,632
我很乐意等着吃萝卜。
I'm happy to wait back on the turnip.

23
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,175
请不要叫它芜菁。
Please don't call it the turnip.

24
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,052
但这艘船看起来像根菜。
But the ship looks like a root vegetable.

25
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:00,222
是的，你在设计评审时已经说得很清楚了。
Yes, you made that very clear at the design review.

26
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,733
你知道我会讲故事有多久了?
How long have you known that I narrate?

27
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,944
直到永远。从你我还是军校学员的时候就开始了。
Forever. Since you and I were cadets.

28
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,196
说到这个，你忘了把菜鸟带走。
Speaking of, you forgot to take the rookie with you.

29
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,616
霍桑指挥官，你知道我对菜鸟的看法。
Ah, Commander Hawthorne, you know how I feel about rookies.

30
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,493
这和我对自动驾驶仪的感觉一样。
It's the same way I feel about autopilots.

31
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,246
“我能为您做些什么?”我能做些什么吗，先生?”
"How may I assist you? Is there anything I can do, sir?"

32
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,540
他们没有帮助，他们只是把事情复杂化了。
They don't help, they just over-complicate things.

33
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,458
我最好还是自己做这件事。
I'm better off just doing the job myself.

34
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,210
所以我把菜鸟带来了。
Which is why I brought the rookie.

35
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,671
你好。
Hello.

36
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,924
-不。-巴斯，按照规定我们要带上他。
-No. -Buzz, protocol requires we bring him along.

37
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,301
-他会有悲伤的眼神。Buzz
-He's gonna have sad eyes. -Buzz.

38
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,927
你知道我受不了悲伤的眼神。
You know I can't deal with sad eyes.

39
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,137
-看那个菜鸟，巴斯。-不。
-Look at the rookie, Buzz. -No.

40
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:41,972
-看这只袋鼠…看…-不…不。
-Look at the roo...Look... -No...no.

41
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:42,890
光年。-不。
-Lightyear. -No.

42
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,057
看看他 ——别看
-Look at him. -Not looking.

43
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:44,975
看 -不
-Look. Look. -No.

44
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,436
-看那个菜鸟。-不。没有。
-Look at the rookie. -No. No.

45
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,066
好吧。好吧。你赢了。
All right. All right. You win.

46
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:58,697
看,羽毛Featheringhamstan…这是Featheringhamstan,先生。
Look, Feather...Featheringhamstan... It's Featheringhamstan, sir.

47
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,116
听着，菜鸟，首先，没人跟你谈，你就别开口。
Look, rookie, first, you will not speak unless spoken to.

48
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,201
-是的，长官-还在说话
-Yes, sir. -Still talking.

49
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,203
第二，尊重诉讼。
Second, respect the suit.

50
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,079
这套西装有一定的意义。
This suit means something.

51
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,082
这不仅保护了你的身体，也保护了整个宇宙。
It's not just protecting your body, it's protecting the universe.

52
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:13,547
这套衣服是对世界的承诺你，只有你一个人会做最重要的一件事。
This suit is a promise to the world that you, and you alone will do one thing above all.

53
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,881
芬兰不惜一切代价完成任务。
Finnish the mission no matter the cost.

54
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:20,511
不管银河系扔给你什么，你永远不会放弃——请你把那个关掉好吗?
You will never quit, whatever the galaxy may throw your way-- Will you please turn that off!

55
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,013
这太简单了。
It's just too easy.

56
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,140
你在嘲笑我，是吗?
You're mocking me, aren't you?

57
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,392
是的，但以支持的方式。
Yeah, but in a supportive way.

58
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,604
听着，指挥官，我想说的是，你和我已经搞定了这份工作。
Look, what I'm trying to say, Commander, is that you and I have this job down.

59
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:31,897
一。仍说话。
-Sir. -Still talking.

60
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,691
我知道你在想什么，我就知道你会在哪里。
At any moment I know what you're thinking, I know where you're gonna be.

61
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,318
但是这个人，我不知道。
But this guy, I don't know.

62
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:37,569
他去哪里来的?
Where'd he go?

63
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,155
你看到了什么?这就是我想说的。
You see? This is exactly what I'm talking about.

64
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,865
他没有帮助。他走开了。
He's not helping. He's wandered off.

65
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,700
葡萄树!
Vines!

66
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:53,919
错误!
Bugs!

67
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,052
这艘船。它沉没。
The ship. It's sinking.

68
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,512
大家，回到萝卜上去!
Everyone, back to the turnip!

69
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,013
哦，现在轮到萝卜了。
Oh, so now it's the turnip.

70
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:16,567
从事隐形模式。这应该能为我们争取足够的时间。
Engage Stealth Mode. That should buy us enough time.

71
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,489
我们撑不下去了。
We're not gonna make it.

72
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:23,991
差不多了!
Almost there!

73
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,619
好的，b计划，准备好了吗?
Okay, plan B. Ready?

74
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:28,537
去吧!
Go!

75
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,555
爆炸!-这里，我可以改变路线。
-Blast! -Here, I can re-route it.

76
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,723
再给我一分钟。
Just give me a minute.

77
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,517
在哪……救命!
Where is the... Help!

78
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:53,937
新手。
rookie.

79
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,314
救命!
Help me!

80
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:59,193
巴斯光年任务日志。这个星球显然不适合居住。
Buzz Lightyear mission log. The planet is clearly uninhabitable.

81
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,736
事实上，完全敌对。
In fact, outright hostile.

82
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:09,178
有知觉的叶子逮捕了学员Furth-Feathering…Featheringston羽毛…他们找来了一个新人，我强烈建议他不应该加入第一个
The sentient foliage have apprehended cadet Furth-Feathering... Featheringston...Feather... They got the rookie, who I strongly suggested should not have joined in the first--

83
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,372
爆炸。
Blast.

84
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,588
Buzz!-现在!
-Buzz! -Now!

85
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:34,937
移动它,管理员!
Move it, ranger!

86
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:39,149
正在回船上的路上。
Making our way back to the ship.

87
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,692
加油,Buzz!
Come on, Buzz!

88
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,737
快点!
Hurry!

89
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,369
引擎室一切正常。
All good at the engine room.

90
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:52,829
-我来掌舵。-我会什么都不做我有这个。
-I'll take the helm. -And I will-- Do nothing. I've got this.

91
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,300
我能为您做些什么?
How may I assist you?

92
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:06,218
蒙特里。
Autopilots.

93
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,886
我能做些什么吗，先生?-不,不!
-Is there anything I can do, sir? -No and no!

94
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,054
这不是模拟。
This is not a simulation.

95
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,683
指挥官,情况如何!
Commander, status!

96
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,684
燃料了。
Fuel engaged.

97
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:14,893
所有系统。
All systems go.

98
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,610
警告。发射轨道不健全的。
Warning. Launch trajectory unsound.

99
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,448
来吧。来吧。
Come on. Come on.

100
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,660
碰撞迫在眉睫。
Collision imminent.

101
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,161
中止。中止。
Abort. Abort.

102
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,629
光年船长，需要我帮忙吗?
Captain Lightyear, do you need my help?

103
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,256
消极的。——你确定吗?
-Negative. -Are you sure?

104
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,967
我是巴斯光年，我一直很确定
I'm Buzz Lightyear. I'm always sure.

105
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,468
情况很糟，巴斯
It's bad, Buzz.

106
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,515
超高速晶体完全被摧毁了。
The hyper-speed crystal was totally destroyed.

107
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:38,434
长话短说:我们被困住了。
Long story short: we're marooned.

108
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,306
我不知道。
I don't know.

109
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,398
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

110
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,775
我自己军事法庭。
I'm court-martialing myself.

111
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:45,943
没有。你不是。
No. You're not.

112
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,530
霍桑指挥官，我在此解除所有太空骑警的职务。
Commander Hawthorne, I hereby relieve myself of all Space Ranger duties.

113
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,115
这是我的错。这些人应该得到更好的待遇。
This was my fault. And these people deserve better.

114
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,867
你可以把我关进禁闭室。
You can throw me in the brig.

115
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,411
完成任务，巴斯。
Finish the mission, Buzz.

116
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:57,621
这就是我们所做的。
That's what we do.

117
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,123
在所有人都回家之前，我们不会结束的。
We're not done until everyone gets home.

118
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,750
但我们没有燃料晶体。
But we have no fuel crystal.

119
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,753
所以我们开采地球上的资源，创造出新的晶体。
So we mine resources on this planet, create a new crystal.

120
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,630
晶体熔合是极不稳定的。
Crystalic fusion is highly unstable.

121
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:07,756
然后我们进行测试。
Then we test it.

122
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,633
没有。太危险了。
No. It's too dangerous.

123
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,388
制造一颗超高速的水晶就像用太阳套索一样。
Manufacturing a crystal capable of hyper-speed is like trying to lasso with the sun.

124
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:22,980
然后就需要有人把太阳挂在飞船上，飞船也需要有人驾驶它，而不是把自己吹到湮灭。
And then someone would need to attach that sun to a ship, and then the ship needs someone to fly it without blowing themselves into oblivion.

125
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,023
脑子正常的人会…
Who in their right mind would...

126
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,369
巴斯光年任务日志。开始日期3902
Buzz Lightyear mission log. Star date 3902.

127
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:44,043
在被困了整整一年之后，我们专业的船员将这个星球上的大量资源发挥了不可思议的作用。
After a full year of being marooned, our specialized crew have put this planet's vast resources to incredible use.

128
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:50,591
终于，我们的第一次超高速试飞成功了。
Finally, our first hyper-speed test flight is a go.

129
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,527
准备好了,队长光年?
Ready, Captain Lightyear?

130
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,071
我已经准备好了，霍桑指挥官。
Ready as I'll ever be, Commander Hawthorne.

131
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,239
到无穷。
To infinity.

132
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,490
甚至更远。
And beyond.

133
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,370
Buzz!我们在外围发现一个缺口。
-Buzz! -We got a breach in the perimeter.

134
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,668
拜托，我只是…队长光年!
Come on, I just... Captain Lightyear!

135
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,128
飞行员迪亚兹。
Airman Diaz.

136
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,506
天啊，今天葡萄藤有点不太好使啊?
Boy, the vines are a little feisty today, huh?

137
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:31,673
我们准备好发射了吗?
Are we ready to launch?

138
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,592
我们都准备好了，先生。
We're all ready if you are, sir.

139
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,930
为四分钟的飞行付出了一年的努力。那不是东西吗?
A year of work for a four minute flight. Isn't that something?

140
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,097
肯定是。
Sure is.

141
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,767
我们去看看这种新型超高速燃料是否稳定。
Well, let's go find out if this new hyper-speed fuel is stable.

142
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:43,810
这样我们就能离开这块石头了。
So I can get us off this rock.

143
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,396
我差点忘了。这是您的静脉注射，先生。
I almost forgot. Here's your I.V.A.N, sir.

144
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,606
完全加载。
Fully loaded.

145
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,191
蒙特里。

146
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,777
当然，这里是XL-01。
And here, of course, is the XL-01.

147
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,946
很甜蜜的旅程。
Pretty sweet ride.

148
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,782
现在我们去拿燃料晶体。
Now let's get you that fuel crystal.

149
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,992
早上好，光年船长。
Good morning, Captain Lightyear.

150
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,915
这是您特制的混合燃料。
Here is your specially formulated fuel mixture.

151
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,002
这就是能达到超高速的燃料吗?
So, this is the fuel that's gonna reach hyper-speed?

152
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,630
有87.6%的几率。
It has an 87.6 percent chance.

153
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,382
我愿意赌一把。
I'll take those odds.

154
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,099
祝你好运,船长。
Good luck, Captain.

155
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,519
我们都指望你了……飞行员。
We're all counting on you... Airman.

156
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,697
XL-01呼叫指挥中心。你收到吗?
XL-01 to Mission Control. Do you copy?

157
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:37,990
收到,XL-01。
Copy, XL-01.

158
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:42,119
我给你四分钟离开地球，然后你马上回来。
I'm gonna grant you four minutes to be off planet, but then you come right back to us.

159
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:43,287
这是命令
That's an order.

160
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,454
收到
Roger that.

161
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,540
极速，我来了。
Hyper Speed, here I come.

162
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:58,135
T - 10... ... 9 ... ...E八，七... ...六……五、四……三,二……。发射。
T minus 10... ...nine... ...e ight, seven... ... six... ...five, four... ...three, two... ...one. Launch.

163
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,411
I.V.A.N，请调出飞行计划。
I.V.A.N., pull up the flight plan, please.

164
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,873
你好。我是你的内在——自动驾驶仪。
Hello. I am your internal-- Autopilots.

165
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,088
你好，我是你的内部声控导航仪，叫我i.v.a.n
Hello, I am your internal voice-activated navigator, call me I.V.A.N.

166
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,632
请准备好飞行计划，静脉注射
Ready the flight plan, please, I.V.A.N.

167
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:37,841
当然
Certainly.

168
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:46,016
你的任务是在外太空加速，绕着阿尔法·特卡尼旋转，然后减速回到这里，回到特卡尼至尊。
Your mission is to accelerate through deep space, slingshot around Alpha T'Kani, then through the deceleration rings back here to T'kani Prime.

169
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:49,436
目标飞行时间4分28秒。
Target flight time: 4 minutes, 28 seconds.

170
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,897
XL-01，可以进行超启动。
XL-01, you are clear for hyper-launch.

171
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,358
收到，控制中心。启动hyper-launch。
Copy, control. Initiating hyper-launch.

172
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,968
接近50%的超高速。
Approaching 50 percent hyper speed.

173
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:27,307
燃料稳定。
Fuel stable.

174
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:30,727
增加速度至0.6c。
Increasing speed to 0.6c.

175
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,858
百分之六十的扫兴。
Sixty percent hyper-speed.

176
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:46,493
速度增加到0.7摄氏度。
Increasing speed to 0.7c.

177
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:52,791
百分之七十的扫兴。
Seventy percent hyper-speed.

178
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,042
燃料稳定。
Fuel stable.

179
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,755
接近0.8摄氏度。
Approaching 0.8c.

180
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,465
扫兴地推动。
Pushing to hyper-speed.

181
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,636
引擎1故障。
Failure in Engine 1.

182
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,806
燃料电池不稳定。
Fuel cell unstable.

183
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:08,765
I.V.A.N状态。
I.V.A.N., status.

184
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,268
轨迹误差，加4度。
Trajectory error, plus four degrees.

185
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,937
不纠正航向将导致失去环。
Failure to course-correct will result in missing the rings.

186
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:17,608
我们会飞向外太空导致死亡
We'll fly off into deep space resulting in certain death.

187
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,026
是的,谢谢你。
Yes, thank you.

188
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:20,777
驱逐是你唯一的选择。
Ejection is your only option.

189
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:22,738
不,不。我能做到。
No, no. I can do it.

190
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:27,117
警告。你有26秒的时间修正航线。
Warning. You have 26 seconds to course-correct.

191
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:30,412
你现在有25秒修正航线。
You now have 25 seconds to course-correct.

192
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,164
-你现在有-请别数了
-You now have-- -Stop counting, please.

193
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:35,626
对不起。我的安全协议禁止我终止倒计时。
I'm sorry. My safety protocols prohibit me from terminating countdown.

194
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:36,835
蒙特里。
Autopilots.

195
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,713
任务失败迫在眉睫。请记下你的遗言。
Mission failure imminent. Please record your last words.

196
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,381
不是今天,I.V.A.N.
Not today, I.V.A.N.

197
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:42,758
不是今天,I.V.A.N.
Not today, I.V.A.N.

198
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,886
如果您对这段录音满意，请选择“1”。
If you are satisfied with this recording, speak or select 1.

199
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,722
静脉注射，全力启动引擎。最大的力量。
I.V.A.N., push the engines all the way. Maximum power.

200
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:53,977
那行动是不可取的。燃料电池爆炸，正是我所期待的。
That action is inadvisable. Fuel cell detonation-- Is exactly what I'm counting on.

201
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,024
情况至关重要。
Situation critical.

202
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,903
燃料电池接近峰值容量。
Fuel cell approaching peak capacity.

203
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,446
打开燃料门，静脉注射
Open up the Fuel Door, I.V.A.N.

204
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,156
对不起。我没听清楚。
I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch that.

205
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,617
请重申你的命令。——开放燃料门!
-Please restate your command. -Open fuel door!

206
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:17,459
五分钟爆炸... ...四个……深入分析……两个…-…。-现在!
Detonation in five... ... four... ...t hree... ...two... -...one. -Now!

207
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,432
纠正。
Course corrected.

208
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:34,226
你没能达到超高速。
You failed to reach hyper-speed.

209
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:35,894
我不需要听到这些，静脉注射
I didn't need to hear that, I.V.A.N.

210
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,020
你没听到吗?
You didn't hear that?

211
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,188
哦，对不起。我将重复一遍。
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll repeat.

212
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,649
-不，我听说-我是说-你没能达到超光速。
-No, I've heard-- I meant-- -You failed to reach hyper-speed.

213
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:41,859
-谢谢，静脉注射-你没够到
-Thank you, I.V.A.N. -You failed to reach--

214
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,091
指挥官，你没事吧?
Commander, are you okay?

215
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,261
迪亚兹，你留了胡子。
Diaz, you grew a beard.

216
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:10,637
你是怎么长胡子的?
How did you grow a beard?

217
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:11,847
哦,对了。
Oh, right.

218
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,640
首先，欢迎回来。
First of, welcome back.

219
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,977
其次……等等。
Secondly... Wait.

220
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,354
等等，这是什么?
Wait, what is this?

221
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:20,974
我离开了多久?
How long was I gone?

222
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,150
四年两个月零三天。
Four years, two months and three days.

223
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,735
什么?
What?

224
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,069
我以为我们失去你了，巴斯。
I thought we've lost you, Buzz.

225
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,405
阿丽莎,怎么了?
Alisha, what happened?

226
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,616
-时间膨胀。-什么?
-Time dilation. -What?

227
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,659
时间膨胀很简单。
Time dilation is quite simple.

228
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:36,705
当你接近超高速时，你的时间相对于我们的时间变慢了。
As you approached hyper-speed, your time slowed relative to our own.

229
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:41,251
所以，在你执行任务的过程中你只老了几分钟，而我们都老了好几年了。
So, during your mission you aged only minutes, while the rest of us have aged years.

230
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:46,590
简单地说:你飞得越快——我飞得越快，我就飞到更远的未来。
Simply put: The faster you fly-- The faster I fly the further into the future I travel.

231
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:47,883
我懂了。
I get it.

232
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,514
那我们现在该怎么办?
So, what are we gonna do now?

233
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,806
我不知道。
I don't know.

234
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:59,436
但我觉得我们应该暂缓进行更多的试飞直到我们想出其他办法。
But I think we should hold off on any more test flights until we've figured out something else.

235
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,730
指挥官，我们说了完成任务。
Commander, we said finish the mission.

236
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:03,106
这就是太空游骑兵的工作。
That's what Space Rangers do.

237
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,691
代价是什么，巴斯?
At what cost, Buzz?

238
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,319
你愿意再失去四年吗?
Are you willing to lose another four years?

239
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:18,121
所有人都因为我而困在这里。
So, everyone is just stuck here because of me.

240
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:30,300
嘿，你没事吧?
Hey, you all right?

241
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,053
是的。是的。我很好。
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

242
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,430
等等,那是什么?
Wait, what's that?

243
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,850
哦，我订婚了。
Oh, I got engaged.

244
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,853
哦，哇。太好了。她叫什么名字?
Oh, wow. That's great. What's her name?

245
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,647
纪子。她是科学小组的一员。
Kiko. She's one of the science crew.

246
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:47,727
有趣的是，如果我们没有被困在这里，一切都不重要。
It's funny, it never would've mattered if we hadn't been stranded.

247
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:50,112
你跟刚认识的人订婚了?
You got engaged to someone you just met?

248
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,031
巴斯，我三年前见过她。
Buzz, I met her three years ago.

249
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,409
哦，对
Oh, right. Right.

250
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,870
好,祝贺你。我很想见见她。
Well, Congratulations. I'd love to meet her.

251
00:17:58,154 --> 00:18:00,873
有的是时间，好好休息。
Well, there's plenty of time for that. Get some rest.

252
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,292
这是命令
That's an order.

253
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:11,425
不客气!Alisha
YOU'RE WELCOME! ALISHA

254
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:27,649
你好,Buzz!
Hello, Buzz!

255
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,486
我是Sox。你的私人伴侣机器人。
I am Sox. Your personal companion robot.

256
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:32,571
我的什么?
My what?

257
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:37,117
我是星际司令部派来缓解你离开后的情绪变化的。
I was issued by star command to ease your emotional transition after your time away.

258
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,954
你想得真周到，机器猫。
Oh, that's very considerate of you, robot feline.

259
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,331
但是不用了，谢谢。
But no thank you.

260
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,249
恐怕这是规定。
I'm afraid it's protocol.

261
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,419
传感器显示你已经错过了四个生日。
Sensors indicate you've missed four birthdays.

262
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:49,505
你想要一套糖霜零食来庆祝一下吗?
Would you like a frosted snack kit to celebrate?

263
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:52,299
负的。那将损害我的营养。
Negative. That would compromise my nutritional regiment.

264
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,971
我们可以谈谈你的感受。我是一个优秀的倾听者。
We can talk about your feelings. I am an excellent listener.

265
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,267
不,不。听着，我经历了很久…一天?
No, no. Look, I've had a very long... day?

266
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:03,727
事情并没有按计划进行。
It did not go as planned.

267
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,771
任务失败了?
The mission was unsuccessful?

268
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,356
肯定的。
Affirmative.

269
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:10,984
哦，不。听到这个消息我很难过。
Oh, no. I am so sorry to hear that.

270
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:12,945
谢谢你,Sox
Thank you, Sox.

271
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,404
不客气,Buzz
You're welcome, Buzz.

272
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:15,989
我们玩个游戏好吗?
Shall we play a game?

273
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:17,400
-不,谢谢。——你确定吗?
-No, thank you. -Are you sure?

274
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,953
我可以根据你的个性特征，专门为你制作游戏。
I can create a game specifically for you, based on your exact personality profile.

275
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,580
嘿，听着，Sox，伙计，我很累了。
Hey, listen, Sox, buddy, I'm pretty tired.

276
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:26,250
所以，我要去架上了。
So, I'm gonna go ahead and hit the rack.

277
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,960
当然。
Of course.

278
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,965
如果你愿意，我可以提供睡眠声音。
I can provide sleep sounds if you like.

279
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,633
我有几个选择。
I have several options.

280
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,261
夏夜，海洋天堂，鲸叫。
Summer night, ocean ​​paradise, whale calls.

281
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:39,263
不,不。白噪音没问题。
No, no. White noise is fine.

282
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:40,430
很好。
Very well.

283
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,140
晚安，Sox -晚安，巴斯
-Good night, Sox. -Good night, Buzz.

284
00:19:48,268 --> 00:19:49,147
拉起来。
Pull up.

285
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,650
拉起来。
Pull up.

286
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,485
光年船长，需要帮忙吗?
Captain Lightyear, do you need help?

287
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:54,653
没有。我能做到。
No. I can do it.

288
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,821
巴斯，你确定吗?
Buzz, are you sure?

289
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:57,322
恐怕这是规定。
I'm afraid it's protocol.

290
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:58,699
我能做到!
I can do it!

291
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:01,743
我能做到。
I can do it.

292
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,996
审查者说你做了一场噩梦。
Censors indicate you had a nightmare.

293
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:06,623
-你想谈谈吗?消极的。
-Would you like to talk about it? -Negative.

294
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:09,376
好吧，但记住，我的任务是帮助你。
Okay, but remember, my mission is to help you.

295
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,044
我不会放弃我的任务。
And I'm not giving up on my mission.

296
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,379
是吗?
Yeah?

297
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:14,256
是的。
Yeah.

298
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:17,342
你知道吗，Sox，我也不会放弃我的任务。
You know what, Sox, I'm not giving up on my mission either.

299
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,678
太棒了!那么我能做什么呢?
Great! So what can I do?

300
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:23,265
那你为什么不去找你的老鼠伙伴呢。
Well, why won't you engage with your mouse buddy.

301
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,894
还有什么更有挑战性的吗?
Is there anything more challenging?

302
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,437
你想要挑战吗?好吧。
You want a challenge? Okay.

303
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:31,106
我想你可以研究一下燃料稳定性的问题。
I guess you could work on this fuel stability thing.

304
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:34,610
Crystalic融合。当然。
Crystalic fusion. Of course.

305
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,111
你什么时候回来?
When should I expect you back?

306
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:38,113
大约四年。
About four years.

307
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,825
等等。你不必这么做的。
Hold on. You don't have to do this.

308
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:43,619
指挥官，这是我的错。
Commander, this is my mistake.

309
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,078
我要把它改正过来。
I need to make it right.

310
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,456
好吧，但也许我们应该考虑一下。
Okay, but maybe we should think about this.

311
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:50,292
思考什么?拜托，我们是太空游骑兵。
Think about what? Come on, we're Space Rangers.

312
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,044
我们完成任务。
We finish the mission.

313
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:55,589
能再穿这套西装就好了。
Well, it would be nice to wear the suit again.

314
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:58,258
人们开始忘记太空骑警的重要性了。
People are starting to forget Space Rangers ever mattered.

315
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,677
好吧，我马上就会解决这个问题。
Well, I'm about to fix that.

316
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,137
到无穷。
To infinity.

317
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:03,764
甚至更远。
And beyond.

318
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:11,772
不稳定
UNSTABLE

319
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:21,884
40周年快乐
HAPPY 40TH ANNIVERSARY

320
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:27,931
不稳定
UNSTABLE

321
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,709
嗨,Buzz
Hi, Buzz.

322
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:03,967
你一两年后就会回来……好吧，我不会。
You're back here in a year or two... and, well, I won't.

323
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:10,516
我不知道这是什么时候发生的，但我似乎已经走了，变得很老了。
I don't know when it happened but I seem to have gone and gotten very old.

324
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:15,187
我一直以为我们会再次成为太空骑警。
I always thought we'd get to be Space Rangers again.

325
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:19,274
我怀念在星空中遨游的时光。
I miss being out among the stars.

326
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,360
所有的冒险。
All the adventures.

327
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:28,242
但最重要的是我想念你。
But more than any of that I missed you.

328
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:31,787
嗨,奶奶。
Hi, Grandma.

329
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:34,581
嘿,甜心。
Hey, sweetheart.

330
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:37,459
我要给我的朋友巴斯留言。
I'm leaving a message for my friend, Buzz.

331
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:38,627
空间管理员吗?
The Space Ranger?

332
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:40,712
这是正确的。
That's right.

333
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:42,631
他现在在太空。
He's in space right now.

334
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:43,799
哇。
Wow.

335
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:46,093
这是我的孙女，伊兹。
This is my granddaughter, Izzy.

336
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,220
我也要成为一名太空骑警。
I'm gonna be a Space Ranger too.

337
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:49,388
就像他吗?
Just like him?

338
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:50,931
就像你。
Just like you.

339
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:56,687
再见,Buzz
Goodbye, Buzz.

340
00:23:57,229 --> 00:24:01,233
很抱歉我不能在那里看着你完成任务。
I'm sorry I won't be there to see you finish the mission.

341
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:05,571
到无穷。
To infinity.

342
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,449
甚至更远。
And beyond.

343
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:47,237
敲门声。敲门声。抱歉打扰了。我刚搬进我的新-
Knock. Knock. Sorry to interrupt. I'm just moving into my new-

344
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,743
看那!巴斯光年本人。
Look at that! The actual Buzz Lightyear in the flesh.

345
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:53,911
肯定的。
Affirmative.

346
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,548
指挥官卡尔伯恩赛德。
Commander Cal Burnside.

347
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,414
我小时候是你的超级粉丝。
I was a big fan of your when I was a kid.

348
00:24:57,581 --> 00:25:01,585
那我很期待和你一起合作最终把我们弄出去。
Well, then I look forward to working with you to finally get us out of here.

349
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:04,379
没人告诉你吗?
Did no one tell you?

350
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:05,756
告诉我什么?
Tell me what?

351
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:07,174
是的。
Yeah.

352
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,288
那是最后一次任务，巴斯。
That was the last mission, Buzz.

353
00:25:10,386 --> 00:25:11,238
什么?
What?

354
00:25:11,322 --> 00:25:13,430
我们决定继续留在这里。
We've decided we gonna go ahead and stay right here.

355
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:15,933
等一下,在这里?否定的，这不是一个可行的选择。
Wait, here? Negative, that is not a viable option.

356
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,061
这是现在。看，我们正在建造这个。
It is now. See, we're building this.

357
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:22,105
激光的盾牌。
Laser shield.

358
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,525
它能把所有的生物挡在外面。
It'll keep all the creeters out.

359
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:27,903
我们就在这里大吃一顿，用我们有的东西凑合着吃。
And we'll just tuck right in here and make do with what we've got.

360
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,864
使做什么?没有。等等。但你不明白，指挥官。
Make do? No. Wait. But you don't understand, Commander.

361
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:33,492
我还是可以做到的。我能让我们离开这里。
I can still do it. I can get us outta here.

362
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,577
伙计，你还这么相信真是太好了。
Man, it's great you still believe that.

363
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,995
但我们没事，巴斯。
But we're good, Buzz.

364
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,956
找到激光防护罩了。
Got the laser shield.

365
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:45,754
哦。你好,Buzz
Oh. Hello, Buzz.

366
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:48,590
Buzz?

367
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:55,597
我有个好消息，巴斯。
Well, I've got some good news, Buzz.

368
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:58,183
我解决了燃料的问题。
I figured out the fuel problem.

369
00:25:58,517 --> 00:25:59,601
什么?
What?

370
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,562
这是一个有趣的组合。
It was an interesting combination.

371
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:04,481
只有一点点变化，但这就造成了很大的不同。
Just the slightest variance, but that made all the difference.

372
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:07,276
Sox，你是怎么做到的?
Sox, how did you do this?

373
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:11,530
我花了62年7个月零5天。
It took me 62 years, seven months and five days.

374
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:13,031
这是稳定的吗?
And it's stable?

375
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:14,241
从理论上讲。
Theoretically.

376
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:17,828
我期待在你的下一个任务中找到答案。
I look forward to finding out on your next mission.

377
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,289
是的…
Yeah...

378
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:24,960
什么?
What?

379
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:27,546
晚上,队长。我们是来接你的机器人同伴的。
Evening, Captain. We're here to pick up your companion robot.

380
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:29,131
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

381
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:31,592
安全的目的。你理解。
Security purposes. You understand.

382
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:33,510
不，实际上，我不知道。
No, actually, I don't.

383
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:36,889
关闭程序，所以我们得让你的猫退役。
Shutting down the program, So, we have to decommission your cat.

384
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:38,265
只需要一秒钟。
It'll just take a second.

385
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:39,850
现在，等等，只是…
Now, hold on, just...

386
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:45,063
至少让我来做。
At least let me do it.

387
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,241
哇?
Whoa?

388
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,165
Buzz。我们要去哪里?
Buzz. Where are we going?

389
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:04,333
我们要去太空了。
We're going to space.

390
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:05,626
什么?
What?

391
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:10,005
巴斯光年任务日志。开始日期……我不知道。
Buzz Lightyear mission log. Star date... I have no idea.

392
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:15,135
有了稳定的燃料配方，我计划达到超高速，这次最终完成任务。
In possession of stable fuel formula I plan to reach hyper-speed and this time finally finish the mission.

393
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:16,637
你在跟谁说话?
Who are you talking to?

394
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:17,804
没关系。
Doesn't matter.

395
00:27:18,597 --> 00:27:23,227
巴斯，我的程序迫使我通知星际司令部你走了——星际司令部要让你退役。
Buzz, my programming compels me to notify Star Command that you have gone-- Star Command was gonna decommission you.

396
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:24,311
-什么?——没错
-What? -That's right.

397
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:26,188
熄灯。不再有Sox
Lights out. No more Sox.

398
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:29,149
嘿!你无权进入这片区域
Hey! You're not authorized to be in this area--

399
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:33,612
我不知道你还能这么做。
Whoa, I didn't know you could do that.

400
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,114
等等，这是给我的以防我太过分吗?
Wait a minute, was that for me in case I got out of line?

401
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:37,407
我给你买了五分钟。
I bought you five minutes.

402
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,842
-好吧，Sox，给我第一个。收到
-All right, Sox, give me the first one. -Roger.

403
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:12,901
好了，开始了。

After borrowing a ship from Star Command I've achieved hyper-speed.

465
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,595
我已经准备好永远离开这个星球了。

469

等等，它在干嘛?
Wait, what's it doing?

474
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:23,555
Zurg。
Zurg.

475
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:27,382
我的船!-闭嘴。
-My ship! -Be quiet.

476
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:28,550
它去哪里来的?

477
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:30,552
放上去。

484
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:38,328
——谁?——机器人。

485
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:41,206
为什么会有机器人?机器人从哪里来?

486
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:42,248

哦，不，那是我奶奶。我是依奇。
Oh, no, that's my grandmother. I'm Izzy.

492
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,431
Izzy?

493
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:01,560
但你只是有点…Sox，我们去了多久?
But you were just a little... Sox, how long were we gone?

494
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:02,728

你确定。
You sure are.

505
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:28,462
你奶奶和我几乎能把对方的话说完。
You know, your grandma and I could practically finish each other's sentences.

506
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:32,466
如果你像她一样，你和我要-…一个伟大的团队。-…有些机器人哭泣。
If you're anything like her, you and I are gonna make-- -... a great team. -...some robots cry.

507
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:37,596
好吧……跟我说说这案子的最新进展。
Okay... So, get me up to speed on this.

508
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:40,182
对。札克的飞船一周前出现过。
Right. The Zurg ship showed up about a week ago.

509
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:41,350
Zurg是什么?
What's a Zurg?

510
00:35:42,038 --> 00:35:45,312
这是机器人唯一会说的话，所以这就是我们所说的大船。
That's the only thing the robots say, so that's what we call the big ship.

511
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:53,070
札克飞船到了，机器人包围了基地，然后……特卡尼擎天石的市民们，外星人机器人来袭了。
The Zurg ship arrived, the robots surrounded the base, and then... Citizens of T'kani Prime, robot aliens have attacked.

512
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:54,821
所有人都在警戒线内。
Everyone inside the perimeter.

513
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:55,864
当心!
Look out!

00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:58,116
我们马上启动激光防护。
We are activating the laser shield immediately.

这是我们最后听到的消息。

516
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:06,750
所有这些人，都指望着我。
All these people, they were counting on me.

517
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,628
现在他们被困住了。
And now they're trapped.

518
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:13,757
我们试着联系他们，但没有联系，内外都没有。
We've tried to reach them, but there's no communication, in or out.

519
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:14,925
Sox?

520
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:16,844
喵喵。她是正确的。
Meow meow. She's correct.

521
00:36:17,629 --> 00:36:19,464
你检查我和你的猫了吗?
Did you check me against your cat?

522
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:21,473
他不是普通的猫。
Well, he's not your standard-issue feline.

523
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,642
事实上，Sox是你祖母送你的礼物。
Actually, Sox was a gift from your grandmother.

524
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:25,936
-你好,依奇。-你好,Sox
-Hello, Izzy. -Hello, Sox.

525
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:29,690
嘿，那是什么声音?来吧，别弄坏我的猫。
Hey, what's that noise? Come on, don't break my cat.

526
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:31,608
他在打呼噜，他喜欢这样
He's purring. He likes it.

527
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:32,776
Sox，你喜欢吗?
Sox, do you like it?

528
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:33,944
我做的事。
I do.

529
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:38,031
我希望你准备好行动了。因为我们只需要一个飞行员。
Well, I hope you're ready for action. Because all we needed was a pilot.

530
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:39,199
为了什么?
For what?

531
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:41,410
我有一个计划，我有一个团队。
I have a plan and I have a team.

532
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:45,664
来吧!
Come on!

533
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:13,692
好了，大家集合。
All right, team, fall in.

534
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:20,574
我找到了一个飞行员。惊喜派对行动开始。
I found a pilot. Operation Surprise Party is a go.

535
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:26,663
我喜欢这个。一个精英小队。精英中的精英。
I like this. An elite squad. The best of the best.

536
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,584
她祖母是兵团历史上最伟大的太空骑警。
You know, her grandmother was the greatest Space Ranger in the history of the Corps.

537
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:32,044
和你一起工作是我的荣幸。
It will be an honor to work with you.

538
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:33,837
来吧，大家围过来。

539
00:37:36,757 --> 00:37:37,966
让我们回顾一下我们的目标。
Let's review our objectives.

540
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:39,134
杀了机器人。
Kill the robots.

541
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:40,302
并没死。
And don't die.

542
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:43,597
"不死"是你每天都想做的事。
"Don't die" is just something you wanna do every day.

543
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:44,765
这仍然是一个目标。
It's still an objective.

544
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:46,767
容我说一句，我们只有一个目标。
If I may, we have one objective.

545
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:49,853
我们得把水晶放进萝卜里，然后离开这里。
We need to put this crystal in the turnip and get outta here.

546
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,606
所以，要做到这一点，我们必须要到基座上。
So, to do that we have to get onto the base.

547
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:55,108
要做到这一点，我们必须杀死所有的机器人。
To do that we have to kill all the robots.

548
00:37:55,275 --> 00:37:57,611
要做到这一点，我们必须摧毁札克的飞船。
To do that we have to destroy the Zurg ship.

549
00:37:57,778 --> 00:38:00,572
而要做到这一点，我们必须不死。
And to do any of that we have to not die.

550
00:38:02,465 --> 00:38:05,661
请允许我解释惊喜派对行动。
DERIC Allow me to explain Operation Surprise Party.

551
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:08,580
这是雷矛行动的一个变种。
It is a variation on Operation Thunder Spear.

552
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:09,998
你没因此获得勋章吗?
Didn't you get a medal for that one?

553
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:14,169
2、其实,但是……等等，你怎么知道"雷矛行动"的?
Two, actually, but... Wait, how do you know about Operation Thunder Spear?

554
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:16,922
我把我奶奶写的《太空骑警》里所有的书都读完了，从头到尾。
I've read all my grandma's Space Ranger books, from cover to cover.

555
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:18,131
两次。
Twice.

556
00:38:19,835 --> 00:38:21,419
打扰一下，机器猫。
Excuse me, robot kitty.

557
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:22,594
哦,对不起。
Oh, sorry.

558
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:27,182
传感器显示，札克飞船为地面上的机器人提供动力。
Sensors have indicated that the Zurg ship powers the robots on the ground.

559
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:31,436
所以，我们飞上去，把船炸了。和吃惊的是,机器人!
So, we fly up there, we blow up the ship. And surprise, robots!

560
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:32,729
你在烤面包。
You're toast.

561
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:34,940
然后，我们把你的水晶放在萝卜里。
Then, we put your crystal in the turnip.

562
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:36,525
完成任务。
And finish the mission.

563
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:39,820
这是个好计划。到无穷。
It's a good plan. To infinity.

564
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:42,698
你是想让我拉你的手指吗?
Are you trying to get me to pull your finger?

565
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:43,866
不要上当。
Don't fall for it.

566
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:48,370
不，不是那样的，是…抱歉，这是我和你奶奶以前经常做的事。
No, not like that, it was... Sorry, it's a thing your grandma and I used to do.

567
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:53,166
我我们从来她不是故意的不管怎样,算了吧。在移动。
I-- We were never-- She didn't mean to... Anyway, forget it. Moving on.

568
00:38:54,543 --> 00:38:57,796
让我们把这些弹药装进穿山甲，全副武装，准备战斗。
Let's load these munitions into the Armadillo and steel ourselves for combat.

569
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,591
惊喜行动开始了。
Operation Surprise Party is on.

570
00:39:01,717 --> 00:39:03,218
巴斯，你听到了吗?
Buzz, do you hear that?

571
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:04,636
我听到一些东西。
I hear something.

572
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:08,599
你觉得是机器人?
You think it's a robot?

573
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:11,101
没有，我们从没见过离基地这么远的机器人。
Nah, we've never seen a robot this far from the base.

574
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:12,269
我什么都没听到。
I don't hear anything.

575
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:14,146
现在我做的。
Now I do.

576
00:39:17,437 --> 00:39:18,577
Zurg。
Zurg.

577
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:24,198
别担心，有我们在。
Don't worry, we got you.

578
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,994
什么?
What?

579
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:33,540
训练弹药不要害怕!初级巡逻队会支持你的。
TRAINING AMMO Fear not! The Junior Patrol has your back.

580
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:34,708
小什么?
The Junior what?

581
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:40,047
不!这艘船!
No! The ship!

582
00:39:46,762 --> 00:39:47,596
我拿到了吗?
Did I get it?

583
00:39:47,763 --> 00:39:48,555
相当接近。
Pretty close.

584
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:50,140
抱歉，我没受过这武器的训练。
Sorry, I'm not trained with this weapon.

585
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:51,099
让我重新加载。
Let me reload.

586
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:53,435
不训练?等等，你说你"没受过训练"是什么意思?
Not trained? Wait, what do you mean you're "not trained"?

587
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,199
你在那里。抓住它!抓住它!
You there. Grab it! Grab it!

588
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:09,701
抓住什么?
Grab what?

589
00:40:09,861 --> 00:40:13,539
我不能携带武器这违反了我的假释条例。
I'm not allowed to handle weapons the violation of my parole.

590
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:14,498
假释?
Parole?

591
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:15,249
Buzz!

592
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:16,166
依奇!现在!
Izzy! Now!

593
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:21,547
不!
No!

594
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:22,965
好的,新的计划。
Okay, new plan.

595
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:24,925
新计划吗?原来的计划是什么?
New plan? What was the old plan?

596
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:26,677
我需要有人看到鱼叉了吗?
I need the-- Anyone seen the harpoons?

597
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:36,478
它们装了鱼叉，但我找不到哦，我找到了。
They came preloaded with a harpoon, but I can't find-- Oh, I found it.

598
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:39,356
我找到了鱼叉。我现在要重新装子弹。看看这个。
I found the harpoons. I'm gonna reload it now. Check this out.

599
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,033
我拿到了吗?
Did I get it?

600
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:50,993
再往左一点。
A little to the left.

601
00:41:16,935 --> 00:41:17,936
什么?
What?

602
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:22,399
我拿到了吗?
Did I get it?

603
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:23,650
你明白了。
You got it.

604
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:24,860
是的!
Yes!

605
00:41:57,184 --> 00:42:01,730
好吧，好吧。到底是怎么回事，你是谁?
Okay, okay. What exactly-- How did that-- Who are you?

606
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:04,066
我们是初级巡逻队，随时为您效劳。
We're the Junior Patrol, at your service.

607
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:06,610
好吧，我需要更多信息。
Right, I'm gonna need more information.

608
00:42:06,777 --> 00:42:09,655
我们是一个由自我激励的学员组成的志愿团队。
We are a volunteer team of self-motivated cadets.

609
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:12,699
我们每个月都要在哨站训练一周。
We train one week in a month here at the outpost.

610
00:42:12,852 --> 00:42:16,328
当机器人出现时，莫、达比和我是上周末第一批到达的。
Mo and Darby and I were the first to arrive last weekend when the robots showed up.

611
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:19,289
所以我们策划了惊喜派对行动。
So, we cooked up Operation Surprise Party.

612
00:42:19,456 --> 00:42:20,874
那么，你们是新手?
So, you are rookies?

613
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:24,461
天啊，我们真想当菜鸟，还在努力。
Boy, we'd love to be rookies, still building up to that.

614
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:26,922
好吧。你接受过军需训练吗?
Okay. Do you have munitions training?

615
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:28,340
部分。战术订婚吗?
-Partial. -Tactical engagement?

616
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:29,716
等待。战斗经验?
-Pending. -Combat experience?

617
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:33,053
是的!如果算上我们刚刚经历的机器人事件。
Yes! If you count the robot situation we just went through.

618
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,888
好吧。来吧,Sox
Okay. Come on, Sox.

619
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:36,139
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

620
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:37,793
听着，你们看起来是好人。
Look, you seem nice people.

621
00:42:37,877 --> 00:42:40,518
我非常支持你们的培训计划。
I'm very supportive of your training initiatives.

622
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:42,563
但我要继续，从这里开始。
But I'm gonna go ahead and take it from here.

623
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:44,481
我们刚从机器人手里救了你。
We just saved you from that robot.

624
00:42:44,648 --> 00:42:46,608
原谅我吗?-莫开了致命一枪。
-Excuse me? -Mo made the kill shot.

625
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,068
莫很幸运。
Mo got lucky.

626
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:49,236
非常。
Very.

627
00:42:49,945 --> 00:42:52,698
所以，如果你能告诉我另一艘船的方向。
So, if you could just point me in the direction of another ship.

628
00:42:52,865 --> 00:42:56,243
废弃的仓库里有正在运行的航天器。
There are operational spacecrafts at the abandoned storage depot.

629
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,619
太好了。那是哪儿?
Great. Where is that?

630
00:42:57,786 --> 00:43:04,751
仓库紧邻资源重组中心，距离您现在的位置4.2公里。
The storage depot is directly adjacent to the Resource Reconstituting Center, which is 4.2 kilometers from your current location.

631
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:06,253
太好了。那是哪儿?
Great. Where is that?

632
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,796
其实很简单。
It's actually quite simple.

633
00:43:07,963 --> 00:43:09,298
好吧。
Okay.

634
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:12,885
你们先向南前往基地。
You will first head south towards the base.

635
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:18,515
过了两个红灯，你会——等等，这不对。那是一条死胡同。
After two stop lights you will-- Wait, that is not right. That is a dead end.

636
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:21,018
哦，我明白了，我走错地方了。
Oh, I see, I was in the wrong spot.

637
00:43:21,185 --> 00:43:23,395
的歉意。我要重新开始。
Apologies. I will start over.

638
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:25,967
你们先向南前往基地。
You will first head south towards the base.

639
00:43:26,081 --> 00:43:32,362
过了两个红绿灯，你就会慢慢左转，然后——开枪。我又犯了一个错误。
After two stop lights you'll take a gentle left and-- Shoot. I have made another error.

640
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:33,530
我们给你看看。
We'll just show you.

641
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:34,720
让我重新开始。
Allow me to restart.

642
00:43:34,807 --> 00:43:37,158
你们先向南前往基地。
You will first head south towards the base.

643
00:43:37,242 --> 00:43:43,165
过了两个红绿灯你要右转……巴斯光年补充任务日志。
After two stop lights you'll take a hard right... Buzz Lightyear supplemental mission log.

644
00:43:43,332 --> 00:43:47,544
在最终实现超高速飞行后，我现在有了一个额外的障碍。
Having finally achieved hyper-speed I now have an additional obstacle in my way.

645
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:52,591
为了逃离这个星球，我必须独自摧毁一艘巨大的外星飞船。
In order to flee this planet I'll have to destroy a massive alien ship alone.

646
00:43:52,758 --> 00:43:54,384
没有任何帮助。
with no assistance of any kind.

647
00:43:54,551 --> 00:43:57,012
你知道，我们可以帮你。这是我们的计划。
You know, we can help you. It is our plan.

648
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:58,180
我不能允许。
I can't allow that.

649
00:43:58,347 --> 00:44:03,352
星际命令代码2709.3禁止我将不合格的人员置于危险的境地。
Star Command Code 2709.3 forbids me from placing unqualified personnel in harms way.

650
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:05,312
好吧，但我是霍桑家的人。
Okay, but I'm a Hawthorne.

651
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:06,688
这不仅仅是一个名字，伊兹。
It's more than just a name, Izzy.

652
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:10,160
你得知道确切的-…在任何场合的反应-…你接下来要说什么。
You have to know exactly-- -... how to react in any sit-- -...what you gonna say next.

653
00:44:10,244 --> 00:44:11,254
我以为我有那个。
I thought I had that one.

654
00:44:11,338 --> 00:44:12,110
好吧。
Okay.

655
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:15,155
而你呢，你被关在监狱里吗?
And you, you're in a correctional situation of some kind?

656
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:16,323
假释程序。
Parole program.

657
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,451
我这样做，他们就能减轻我的刑期。
I do this and they shave a little time off my sentence.

658
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:21,411
但我真的学到了很多。
But I really learned a lot in there.

659
00:44:21,578 --> 00:44:23,580
达比可以拿任何三样东西让它们爆炸。
Darby can take any three things and make them explode.

660
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:25,958
好吧。你呢?
Okay. And what about you?

661
00:44:26,124 --> 00:44:29,753
我吗?我以为这会是一个有趣的训练营训练。
Me? I thought this was gonna be like a fun boot camp workout thing.

662
00:44:29,913 --> 00:44:31,248
但事实并非如此。
But it is not.

663
00:44:31,414 --> 00:44:35,092
我其实是来交我的东西的他是个半途而废的人。
So, I was actually coming out here to turn in my stuff-- He's a quitter.

664
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,385
我不是一个轻易放弃的人。
I'm not a quitter.

665
00:44:36,552 --> 00:44:37,427
你是辞职。
You were quitting.

666
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:39,805
你在说什么?我只是想换个方向。
What are you talking about? I was just going in a different direction.

667
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:41,515
是的，放弃者的方向。
Yeah, the direction of a quitter.

668
00:44:41,682 --> 00:44:42,850
你知道吗，我放弃。
You know what, I give up.

669
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:45,018
可以去吗?在你的. .
-See? -On your right..

670
00:44:58,304 --> 00:44:59,199
Zurg。
Zurg.

671
00:44:59,283 --> 00:45:00,617
现在，我说到哪里了?
Now, where was I?

672
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:02,411
我们到了。让我回顾一下。
Here we are. Let me back up.

673
00:45:04,204 --> 00:45:07,082
嘿，继续练习你的技巧。这是唯一能让你好起来的方法。
Hey, keep working on your skills. It's the only way to get better.

674
00:45:07,249 --> 00:45:08,250
我们可以帮助你。
We can help you.

675
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:10,919
我很感激。回你的训练场去吧。
And I appreciate that. Just go back to your training facility.

676
00:45:11,086 --> 00:45:12,880
保持警惕。保持安全。
Stay alert. Stay safe.

677
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:16,633
我要征用这只P-32犰狳然后去炸了札克的飞船。
I'm going to commandeer this P-32 Armadillo and go blow up the Zurg ship.

678
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:18,302
所以这就是再见?
So, this is just goodbye?

679
00:45:18,594 --> 00:45:19,970
肯定的。再见。
Affirmative. Goodbye.

680
00:45:22,347 --> 00:45:24,224
对不起，我忘了带我的猫。
Sorry, I forgot my cat.

681
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:36,153
生命形式。
Life forms detected.

682
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:37,362
他们是什么?
What are they?

683
00:45:37,522 --> 00:45:39,149
巨型昆虫有机体。
Giant insectoid organisms.

684
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:41,825
这座建筑看起来像是蜂房。
The building appears to be some sort of hive.

685
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:42,910
他们是威胁吗?
Are they a threat?

686
00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:44,745
传感器显示它们正在冬眠。
Sensors indicate they are hibernating.

687
00:45:44,912 --> 00:45:45,913
很好。
Very good.

688
00:45:46,496 --> 00:45:47,748
噢,瞧!
Oh, look!

689
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:49,458
XL-01。
It's the XL-01.

690
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:52,711
已经很久了，自从…哇。
It's been a long time since... Whoa.

691
00:45:52,794 --> 00:45:53,795
它是什么?
What is it?

692
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:55,380
来吧，我带你去。
Come on, I'll show you.

693
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:11,855
最后。
Finally.

694
00:46:15,651 --> 00:46:16,652
抱歉打扰了。
Sorry to interrupt.

695
00:46:16,818 --> 00:46:18,362
看来你玩得很开心啊。
Looks like you were having a real nice moment.

696
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:19,905
你在这里做什么?这不是安全的。
What are you doing here? It's not safe.

697
00:46:20,113 --> 00:46:21,406
你拿了我们卡车的钥匙。
You took the keys to our truck.

698
00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:22,574
他们在那。
There they are.

699
00:46:27,913 --> 00:46:29,164
来吧。来吧。
Come on. Come on.

700
00:46:29,331 --> 00:46:30,415
安静的。我尝试。
-Quiet. -I'm trying.

701
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:33,502
明白了。
Got it.

702
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:38,006
快来人把门打开
-Somebody get-- -Get the door!

703
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:41,718
你要说"去开门"我就去开门了。
You were gonna say "get the door", and I got the door.

704
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:46,515
我就直说了吧。我希望那没有发生。
Well, I'm gonna be blunt here. I wish that hadn't happened.

705
00:46:46,682 --> 00:46:47,975
我们其他人也一样。
So did the rest of us.

706
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:49,142
每个人都拿起武器。
Everyone grab a weapon.

707
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:53,856
伙计，我很想，但是我的假释作为星际指挥官，我授予你紧急授权。
Boy, I'd love to, but my parole-- As a Star Command Officer I grant you emergency authority.

708
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:55,524
我们要炸出一条路。
We're gonna blast our way outta here.

709
00:46:55,691 --> 00:46:56,608
现在我们说的!
Now we're talking!

710
00:46:56,775 --> 00:47:00,404
巴斯，被正面攻击存活的概率是38.2%
Buzz, the probability of survival a frontal attack is 38.2 percent.

711
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:01,738
似乎有点低。
Seems a bit low.

712
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:03,031
潜行模式呢?
What about Stealth Mode?

713
00:47:03,198 --> 00:47:04,366
你是怎么知道隐身模式的?
How do you know about Stealth Mode?

714
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:06,535
我和奶奶以前经常玩潜行模式。
Grandma and I used to play Stealth Mode all the time.

715
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:08,304
这就像捉迷藏，但有一个转折。
It was like hide-and-seek, but with a twist.

716
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:11,999
好吧，其实这是个好想法。我会用潜行模式迷惑他们。
Okay, well, it's actually good thinking. I'll use Stealth Mode to disorient them.

717
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:14,084
或者，跟紧我。
Or, and stick with me here.

718
00:47:14,237 --> 00:47:17,282
我们都可以使用隐身模式，然后直接离开。
We could all use Stealth Mode and just walk right out.

719
00:47:19,006 --> 00:47:20,883
你是说，你会穿太空骑警的衣服吗?
You mean, you would wear a Space Ranger suit?

720
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:22,885
这个上面已经有我的名字了。
This one already has my name on it.

721
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:26,722
好吧。
Okay.

722
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:28,515
让我们来回顾一下。
Let's review.

723
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:30,726
我要去那边。
I'm going-- That way.

724
00:47:30,893 --> 00:47:33,020
你要走——往那边走。
And you're going-- That way.

725
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:34,188
好吧。很好。
Okay. Very good.

726
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:39,818
来看看，我是Feathers……羽毛……哦，看，一支笔。酷。
Check it out, I'm Feathers... Feathering... Oh, look, a pen. Cool.

727
00:47:39,985 --> 00:47:42,029
你的有钢笔吗?-好的,注意。
-Does yours have a pen? -Okay, pay attention.

728
00:47:42,196 --> 00:47:43,405
隐身模式相当简单。
Stealth mode is fairly simple.

729
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:47,993
只有两部分。你按下按钮-是这个按钮吗?-我会告诉你哪个按钮。
There are just two parts. You press the button-- -Is it this button? -I will tell you which button.

730
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,244
-这个按钮怎么样?我很抱歉。
-What about this button? -I'm sorry.

731
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:51,205
我们没有时间把所有的按钮都过一遍。
We're not gonna have time to go over all the buttons.

732
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:52,831
好吧，忘了按钮吧。那这个呢?
Okay, forget the button. What about this thing?

733
00:47:52,998 --> 00:47:53,832
——更重要的是——-不!不!
-It's more-- -No! No!

734
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:56,126
这是投降链。你从不拉那个。
That's the surrender strand. You never pull that.

735
00:47:56,293 --> 00:47:58,629
这是太空骑警最可耻的行为了。
There is no more shameful maneuver for a Space Ranger.

736
00:47:58,795 --> 00:47:59,796
原谅我。
Excuse me.

737
00:47:59,963 --> 00:48:02,174
我是不是错过了隐身模式的按钮?
Did I miss which button is the Stealth Mode button?

738
00:48:02,341 --> 00:48:03,425
这个按钮。
It's this button.

739
00:48:03,592 --> 00:48:04,635
没有!
Not yet!

740
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:09,515
你按下这个按钮，然后从前门出去，我去炸了札克的飞船。
You push this button, then you go out the front door, and I'll go blow up the Zurg ship.

741
00:48:09,681 --> 00:48:11,099
准备好了吗?准备好了。
-Ready? -Ready.

742
00:48:11,308 --> 00:48:13,101
不,等等。没有准备好。坚持下去。
No, wait. Not ready. Hang on.

743
00:48:13,268 --> 00:48:15,187
好了，知道了，那样会很尴尬的。
Okay, got 'em. That would've been embarrassing.

744
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:17,731
好吧。
Okay.

745
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:18,982
再见了。
Goodbye again.

746
00:48:25,279 --> 00:48:27,281
Sox，你阻碍了我的视觉。
Sox, you're inhibiting my visual.

747
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:28,784
对不起。这是更好的吗?
Sorry. Is this better?

748
00:48:28,951 --> 00:48:30,786
消极的。-好吧，这样怎么样?
-Negative. -Okay, how about this?

749
00:48:31,537 --> 00:48:32,746
这个怎么样?
How about this?

750
00:48:44,758 --> 00:48:46,552
好吧。我们开始吧。
Okay. Here we go.

751
00:48:53,642 --> 00:48:56,186
非常好。隐身模式按计划进行。
Very good. Stealth Mode working as planned.

752
00:48:57,623 --> 00:49:01,067
这很酷。这些蠢虫子根本看不见我们。
This is pretty cool. These dumb bugs can't even see us.

753
00:49:01,322 --> 00:49:03,157
嘿,bug。嘿,bug。Bug。
Hey, bug. Hey, bug. Bug.

754
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,820
我就在这里，宝贝。你看不见我吗?
I'm right here, bug. Can't you see me?

755
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:08,949
他不能。他根本看不见我。
He can't. He can't see me at all.

756
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:11,368
时间流逝。
And time has elapsed.

757
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:13,662
等等,计时器。
Wait, the timer.

758
00:49:13,871 --> 00:49:15,247
他们不知道计时器的事。
They don't know about the timer.

759
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:18,625
你看不到我。
You don't see me.

760
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:20,043
等等。我能看见你。
Wait. I can see you.

761
00:49:20,794 --> 00:49:21,962
我也能看见你。
I can see you too.

762
00:49:22,588 --> 00:49:23,922
虫子能看见我们。
The bugs can see us.

763
00:49:24,464 --> 00:49:26,091
不,不。我投降。
No, no. I surrender.

764
00:49:28,066 --> 00:49:29,206
拉!
Pull!

765
00:49:33,974 --> 00:49:35,517
回来了!回来了!
Back! Back!

766
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:39,021
这不是工作。
This isn't working.

767
00:49:39,188 --> 00:49:40,564
你必须继续前进!
You have to keep going!

768
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,609
我们必须掉头。
We have to turn around.

769
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:46,695
他们正朝我们来。
They're headed right for us.

770
00:49:46,862 --> 00:49:49,072
不,不。不要接近车辆!
No, no. Do not approach the vehicle!

771
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:04,213
好吧!
All right!

772
00:50:04,379 --> 00:50:05,839
-适应的方式，团队。-给我。
-Way to adapt, team. -Give it up here.

773
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:07,925
你们为什么要祝贺自己?
Why are you congratulating yourselves?

774
00:50:08,077 --> 00:50:10,209
因为我刚把我们从困境中解救出来。
Because I just Hawthorned us out right outta that situation.

775
00:50:10,293 --> 00:50:13,346
但如果你告诉我们隐身模式消失了，你就能活下来。
But you could've made it if-- If you had told us the Stealth Mode wears off.

776
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:18,268
嗯…好了，大家系好安全带。
Well... Okay, everyone just strap in.

777
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:22,773
你好，我是你的——
Hello, I am your--

778
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:36,203
坚持住!
Hold on!

779
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:41,959
我们要去太空吗?
Are we going to space?

780
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:43,585
不，我要把你丢在某个地方。
No, I'm gonna drop you somewhere.

781
00:50:47,256 --> 00:50:49,383
那是个大漩涡。我想我需要一个袋子。
That was a big swirly turn. I think I need a bag.

782
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,134
不,不。请勿在车内呕吐。
No, no. Do not vomit inside the vehicle.

783
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:53,470
我能看到星星。这是空间。
I can see starts. That is space.

784
00:50:53,637 --> 00:50:54,721
现在发生了什么?
What is happening right now?

785
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:55,931
她害怕空间。
She's afraid of space.

786
00:50:56,098 --> 00:50:59,518
-什么?她应该是。太可怕了伊兹，记住你的练习。
-What? -She should be. It's horrible Izzy, remember your exercises.

787
00:50:59,685 --> 00:51:00,936
——要来了。-不,没有。
-It's coming. -No, no.

788
00:51:01,103 --> 00:51:02,062
使用你的头盔。那样会抓住它的。
Engage your helmet. That will catch it.

789
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:03,772
Buzz!另一艘船!依奇,我试着—
-Buzz! Another ship! -Izzy, I'm trying--

790
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:27,671
我什么也看不见。
I can't see anything.

791
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:29,590
哦，不!地球的阴暗面。
Oh, no! The dark side of the planet.

792
00:51:29,756 --> 00:51:30,966
在那里!三点!
Over there! Three o'clock!

793
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:33,385
等等。这可不妙。
Hold on. This isn't gonna be pretty.

794
00:51:44,146 --> 00:51:45,147
每个人都好吗?
Is everyone okay?

795
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:46,148
我想是的。
I think so.

796
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,618
Sox，给我一份损坏报告。
Sox, give me a damage report.

797
00:51:57,784 --> 00:51:59,453
请稍等。
One moment, please.

798
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:03,040
好吧。这是更好的。
Okay. This is better.

799
00:52:03,498 --> 00:52:04,625
这样好点了吗?
Is this better?

800
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:10,756
不，很明显这是更糟糕的整体，我的意思是…你知道的…你怎么会害怕太空?
No, obviously this is worse overall, I just meant... You know... How are you afraid of space?

801
00:52:11,256 --> 00:52:12,341
哦，这很简单。
Oh, It's pretty easy.

802
00:52:12,674 --> 00:52:21,141
你知道吗，如果你放手，你就会永远朝着同一个方向前进，就…那你打算怎么炸掉札克的飞船?
Did you know if you let go out there you just keep going in the same direction forever, just... Well, then how were you going to blow up the Zurg ship?

803
00:52:21,308 --> 00:52:23,101
我应该是地面支援。
I would've been ground support.

804
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:26,188
我知道，奶奶不害怕空间。
I know, grandma wasn't afraid of space.

805
00:52:26,355 --> 00:52:28,273
不，因为她是太空骑警。
No, because she was a Space Ranger.

806
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,943
天体恐惧症是一种自动丧失资格的行为。
Astrophobia is an automatic disqualification.

807
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:32,402
那是什么东西?
What was that thing?

808
00:52:32,611 --> 00:52:34,112
我不知道。-它还会回来吗?
-I don't know. -Is it gonna come back?

809
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:35,405
我不知道。
I don't know.

810
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:37,908
但它是怎么——好吧，你不知道。
But how did it-- Okay, you don't know.

811
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:45,374
我做了。我终于拿到水晶了。这一切本该结束的。
I was done. I finally had the crystal. This was supposed to be over.

812
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:47,584
但我在骗谁呢?
But who am I kidding?

813
00:52:48,544 --> 00:52:49,921
我不需要水晶。
I don't need a crystal.

814
00:52:50,005 --> 00:52:52,042
我需要一台时间机器来摆脱这个烂摊子。
I need a time machine to get out of this mess.

815
00:52:52,756 --> 00:52:54,007
评估完成。
Assessment complete.

816
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:55,175
这有多糟糕?
How bad is that?

817
00:52:57,261 --> 00:53:01,306
爆炸被隔热罩吸收了，只造成了轻微的电气短路。
The blast was absorbed by the heat shield and only caused a minor electrical short.

818
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:02,474
好吧。
Okay.

819
00:53:02,641 --> 00:53:07,646
因此，为了能够飞行，犰狳需要一种特殊的电容材料。
So, in order to be flight operational the Armadillo will require a material of specialized capacitance.

820
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:09,106
哦，像是电子的东西。
Oh, like an electrical thingy.

821
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:10,274
你怎么知道的?
How do you know that?

822
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,483
我们知道这一点。
We learned this.

823
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:15,904
专用电容,还记得吗?我们上个月做的无线电?
Specialized capacitance, remember? We built those field radios last month?

824
00:53:16,071 --> 00:53:17,114
哦，是的。这是有趣的。
Oh, yeah. That was fun.

825
00:53:17,281 --> 00:53:18,407
是啊，不过达比把她的事搞砸了。
Yeah, except Darby messed hers up.

826
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:21,577
我会毁了你的，拜托。我在努力思考。
I'm gonna mess you up-- Please. I'm trying to think here.

827
00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:23,871
我把我的搞砸了，但我又把它修好了。
I messed mine up, but then I fixed it up.

828
00:53:24,037 --> 00:53:25,372
但是你弄坏了电脑控制台。
But you broke that computer console.

829
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:27,624
我需要那个小线圈来…那是什么?
I needed that little coil for its... What was that?

830
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:28,834
专门的电容。
Specialized capacitance.

831
00:53:29,001 --> 00:53:31,295
老实说，外面还有很多地方。
Hey, honestly, there is a lot of room out here.

832
00:53:31,461 --> 00:53:36,550
如果你们想追忆往事，可以去那里，看，那里没有人在思考。
If you guys wanna reminisce you could go over there, or look, there's no one trying to think over there.

833
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:38,635
我们可以上去。
We can go up there.

834
00:53:38,802 --> 00:53:39,803
好吧。完美的。
Fine. Perfect.

835
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:42,222
是的。好的,新的计划。
Yes. Okay, new plan.

836
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:43,390
等等。什么?
Wait. What?

837
00:53:43,557 --> 00:53:45,601
那个采矿设备会有控制台的，对吧?
That mining facility will have a console, right?

838
00:53:45,767 --> 00:53:48,145
那个控制台会有一个小线圈，对吧?
That console will have a little coil thing, right?

839
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:51,148
这个小线圈会有…专门的电容。
And that little coil thing will have the... Specialized capacitance.

840
00:53:51,315 --> 00:53:53,650
我们得修好这艘船，对吧?
That we need to fix this ship, right?

841
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:54,651
她是对的。
She's right.

842
00:53:57,946 --> 00:54:01,116
好工作。这才是霍桑式的思维方式。
Good job. Now that's thinking like a Hawthorne.

843
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:06,990
在那东西再次找到我们之前，我们去拿那东西，离开这里。
Let's go get that part and get outta here before that thing finds us again.

844
00:54:29,061 --> 00:54:30,312
哇。
Whoa.

845
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:32,439
在那里。
Over there.

846
00:54:35,734 --> 00:54:37,277
好了，开始。
Okay, here we go.

847
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:47,204
巴斯光年任务日志。
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

848
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:52,042
为了修理我们的飞船，我们必须想办法进入指挥中心，然后……
In order to repair our ship we have to find some way to get inside the Command Center and...

849
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:56,255
干得好，老犯人。
Nice job, elderly convict.

850
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:01,385
激活线圈应该在这里。
Okay, the activation coil should be in here.

851
00:55:01,552 --> 00:55:02,553
Sox?

852
00:55:03,845 --> 00:55:04,846
需要一个钢笔吗?
Need a pen?

853
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,640
明白了。
Got it.

854
00:55:07,516 --> 00:55:08,809
好吧,是的。另一个时间。
Okay, yeah. Another time.

855
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:11,478
哦,不。
Oh no.

856
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:13,605
安全措施激活。
Security measures activated.

857
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,650
不!不是这一次。
No! Not this again.

858
00:55:16,817 --> 00:55:18,026
不是什么?这是什么?
Not what? What is this?

859
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:23,073
一个捕获锥。直到他们来抓你。
A capture cone. That holds you until they come and get you.

860
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,367
没人会来救我们。他们都被困在基地里了。
No one's coming to get us. They're all trapped in the base.

861
00:55:25,534 --> 00:55:26,702
我们该走了，对吧?
So, we should just leave, right?

862
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:28,287
我们不能就这么走了。
We can't just leave.

863
00:55:28,453 --> 00:55:31,415
相信我们可以的。相信我，我们可以随时离开。
Sure we can. Take it from me, we can always just leave.

864
00:55:32,082 --> 00:55:33,083
看到了吗?
Look, see?

865
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:35,627
来吧!
Come on!

866
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,921
告诉你了。
Told you.

867
00:55:38,422 --> 00:55:44,011
现在，要小心，因为这些东西——如果它们碰在一起。
Now, be careful, because these things-- combine if they touch.

868
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:46,722
好吧,对不起。但也许我们都试试?
All right, sorry. But maybe if we both try it?

869
00:55:46,889 --> 00:55:48,599
那没用的。
That's not gonna work.

870
00:55:48,765 --> 00:55:50,017
你都没试过。
You haven't even tried.

871
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:52,394
不!
No!

872
00:55:52,741 --> 00:55:53,574
猫叫。
Meow.

873
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:56,148
是的，那没用。
Yeah, that didn't work.

874
00:55:56,308 --> 00:55:57,642
巴兹?-啊,等等。
-Buzz? -Whoa, hold on.

875
00:55:57,816 --> 00:55:59,943
如果我和你一起被困在里面，我对谁都没帮助。
I'm no help to anyone if I'm stuck in there with you.

876
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,570
Sox，你能把这些关了吗?
Sox, can you turn these off?

877
00:56:02,863 --> 00:56:04,615
我够不着控制器。
I can't reach the controls.

878
00:56:05,324 --> 00:56:07,492
等等，这里的地板很软。
Wait, there's a soft spot in the floor here.

879
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:09,036
-也许我们可以-那是我的脚
-Maybe if we could-- -That's my foot.

880
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,829
对不起。等待,看它!
-Sorry. -Wait, watch it!

881
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:14,708
等待,就是这样。那东西驱动着这些东西。
Wait, that's it. That thing powers these things.

882
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:16,960
-那我们再来一次。等。等等。
-Then let's hit it again. -Wait. Wait.

883
00:56:17,628 --> 00:56:19,129
我们需要敞开大门。
We need the door to be open.

884
00:56:19,296 --> 00:56:22,299
我打开这个。你撞上了电源。
So I'll open this. You slam into the power source.

885
00:56:22,466 --> 00:56:24,885
这些东西会消失。我们马上走出去。
These things will disappear. And we'll walk right out.

886
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:25,886
-是的，长官-好的
-Yes, sir. -All right.

887
00:56:26,053 --> 00:56:26,845
准备好了吗?
Ready?

888
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:31,808
继续努力!
Keep trying!

889
00:56:36,355 --> 00:56:37,814
我们只是不够重。
We're just not heavy enough.

890
00:56:38,524 --> 00:56:40,275
巴斯，我们需要你。
Buzz, we need you.

891
00:56:40,442 --> 00:56:41,735
等一下,在那里?
Wait, in there?

892
00:56:41,902 --> 00:56:44,154
但如果没用我就救不了你了。
But if it doesn't work I won't be able to save you.

893
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:47,199
你不需要拯救我们，你需要加入我们。
You don't need to save us, you need to join us.

894
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:56,416
一次。
Again.

895
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:58,961
再一次!
Again!

896
00:57:01,505 --> 00:57:02,464
再一次!
Again!

897
00:57:09,388 --> 00:57:10,472
不!
No!

898
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:12,307
去吧!去吧!
Go! Go!

899
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:14,768
小心!
Watch out!

900
00:57:19,064 --> 00:57:20,065
Buzz,不!
Buzz, no!

901
00:57:20,232 --> 00:57:21,400
我们需要线圈。
We need the coil.

902
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:40,794
我们得到了你。
We got you.

903
00:57:49,845 --> 00:57:50,971
噢,看。零食。
Oh, look. Snacks.

904
00:57:53,182 --> 00:57:54,474
有人去吃点心吗?
Anyone going for the snack?

905
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:57,853
肉三明治
MEAT SANDWICH

906
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:06,612
这里。让我们都重新充电吧。
Here. Let's all re-charge a little.

907
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:10,949
给你。
Here you go.

908
00:58:13,476 --> 00:58:18,999
这是，这是，这是，这是怎么回事?
Huh, this is, uh-- What-- What's-- What's happening here?

909
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:20,626
你的三明治有问题吗?
Something wrong with your sandwich?

910
00:58:20,792 --> 00:58:23,378
为什么肉在外面?
Why is the meat on the outside?

911
00:58:23,712 --> 00:58:25,339
因为它是三明治?
Because it's a sandwich?

912
00:58:25,506 --> 00:58:27,508
不，面包应该在外面。
No, the bread is supposed to be on the outside.

913
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:29,218
什么，面包，肉，还是面包?
What, like, bread, meat, bread?

914
00:58:29,384 --> 00:58:30,552
面包太多了。
That's too much bread.

915
00:58:31,053 --> 00:58:32,804
是的，但这全是湿的。
Yes, but this is all wet.

916
00:58:32,971 --> 00:58:35,015
是的。多汁的手指。这是最棒的部分。
Yeah. Juicy fingers. That's the best part.

917
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:36,850
你上次吃三明治是什么时候?
When was the last time you had a sandwich?

918
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:39,054
我不知道，大概一百年前吧。
I don't know, a hundred years ago, give or take.

919
00:58:39,228 --> 00:58:41,188
只有“面包，肉，面包”。
Just a "bread, meat, bread."

920
00:58:41,355 --> 00:58:42,356
面包太多了。
That's too much bread.

921
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:44,608
那只会吸走你嘴里所有的水分。
That would just suck all the moisture out of your mouth.

922
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:46,568
说得好 Darby
Good one, Darby.

923
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:47,945
哦,不!
Oh, no!

924
00:58:48,153 --> 00:58:49,029
Sox!

925
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,448
醒来,Sox
Wake up, Sox.

926
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:53,575
来吧，小家伙，回到我身边。
Come on, little buddy, come back to me.

927
00:58:54,201 --> 00:58:55,661
请 Sox  对不起。
Please, Sox. I'm sorry.

928
00:58:56,495 --> 00:58:57,496
Sox.

929
00:58:59,915 --> 00:59:01,625
你好。我需要重启。
Hello. I require a reboot.

930
00:59:06,797 --> 00:59:10,676
对不起,伙计们。我差点杀了Sox。
I'm sorry, guys. I almost killed Sox.

931
00:59:10,968 --> 00:59:13,095
我刚才差点害死我们所有人。
I almost got us all killed back there.

932
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:16,515
听我说，这只是个误会。
Hey, listen to me, it was just a mistake.

933
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,141
对吧，巴斯?
Right, Buzz?

934
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:24,147
试着做得更好一点。
Just try to get a little better.

935
00:59:30,624 --> 00:59:31,667
听。
Listen.

936
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:42,624
我只是…当我第一次去学院的时候，我不是…你知道的…好。
I just... When I first went to the Academy I was not... you know... good.

937
00:59:43,625 --> 00:59:46,170
我每天都把事情搞砸。
I screwed up every day.

938
00:59:47,754 --> 00:59:49,131
我被障碍赛缠住了。
I got tangled in the obstacle course.

939
00:59:49,298 --> 00:59:51,925
我的手抖得太厉害了，都打不到靶子了。
My hands shook so much I couldn't hit the target.

940
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:54,761
不是的靶子。整个目标。
Not the bulls-eye. The whole target.

941
00:59:55,512 --> 01:00:00,893
第一周我就打算辞职了…很明显我不是太空骑警的料。
And I was gonna quit after the first week, it was... clear I was not Space Ranger material.

942
01:00:01,059 --> 01:00:02,102
真的吗?
Really?

943
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:03,562
是的。
Yeah.

944
01:00:04,021 --> 01:00:06,106
但她奶奶在我身上看到了一些东西。
But her grandma saw something in me.

945
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:10,194
所以我也开始寻找它。
So I started looking for it too.

946
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:13,363
重新调整。
Recalibrating.

947
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:17,117
一个损坏的文件恢复。
One corrupted file restored.

948
01:00:18,911 --> 01:00:20,120
嘿，他抽烟了。
Hey, he's lighting up.

949
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:23,165
奶奶。-你好,Sox
-Grandma. -Hello, Sox.

950
01:00:23,332 --> 01:00:25,042
我需要你帮我个忙。
I need you to do me a favor.

951
01:00:25,209 --> 01:00:29,213
我需要你照顾我最好的朋友。他的名字叫巴斯。
I need you to look after my best friend. His name is Buzz.

952
01:00:29,796 --> 01:00:33,342
他现在不在，但很快就会回来。
He's away right now, but he'll be back soon.

953
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:35,511
他是太空骑警。
He's a Space Ranger.

954
01:00:35,677 --> 01:00:38,555
他会带我们回家的。带我们回家。
He's going to get us all home. Get us all home.

955
01:00:53,111 --> 01:00:54,363
怎么了?
What's wrong?

956
01:00:54,905 --> 01:00:56,198
你没听到吗?
Did not you hear that?

957
01:00:56,573 --> 01:00:58,951
她相信我能弥补我犯下的错误。
She believed I could fix the mistake I made.

958
01:00:59,785 --> 01:01:01,954
而这种信念让她失去了一切。
And that belief cost her everything.

959
01:01:02,829 --> 01:01:04,706
一切吗?没有。
Everything? No.

960
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:08,836
她有奶奶纪子，我爸爸和我，还有她所有的朋友。
She had grandma Kiko, my Dad and me, all her friends.

961
01:01:09,795 --> 01:01:13,882
她本不想来这里的，但她在这个星球上度过了一生，巴斯。
She didn't meant to be here, but she had a whole life on this planet, Buzz.

962
01:01:14,716 --> 01:01:15,884
我们所有人都有。
All of us had.

963
01:01:17,052 --> 01:01:18,762
除了你。
Except for you.

964
01:01:21,139 --> 01:01:25,394
我们想再次成为太空游骑兵。我们想要有所作为。
We wanted to be Space Rangers again. We wanted to matter.

965
01:01:26,603 --> 01:01:29,439
相信我，她很重要。
Believe me, she mattered.

966
01:01:42,244 --> 01:01:43,829
你知道，这样挺好的。
You know, it is pretty good this way.

967
01:01:44,413 --> 01:01:48,375
是吗?面包、肉、面包。你这样做了多久?
Yeah? Bread, meat, bread. How long did you do it like that?

968
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:49,918
永远。
Forever.

969
01:01:52,171 --> 01:01:53,547
完全充电。
Fully recharged.

970
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:54,965
来吧。
Come on.

971
01:01:55,132 --> 01:01:57,718
我们把这部分装上船，然后离开这里。
Let's go put this part in the ship and get outta here.

972
01:01:58,302 --> 01:01:59,303
Sox，你能照亮我们的路吗?
Sox, can you light our way?

973
01:01:59,469 --> 01:02:00,470
当然。
Of course.

974
01:02:00,572 --> 01:02:03,312
点击点击。点击点击。
Click click. Click click.

975
01:02:03,932 --> 01:02:06,643
我看到你。我会抓住你的。我会抓住你的。
I see you. I'm gonna get ya. I'm gonna get ya.

976
01:02:06,803 --> 01:02:07,596
哦，我没听懂。
Oh, I didn't get ya.

977
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:09,438
Sox?——你去哪了?我抓住你了!
-Sox? -Where'd you go? I got you!

978
01:02:09,605 --> 01:02:10,856
Sox。-是的,抱歉。
-Sox. -Yeah, sorry.

979
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:17,647
这是令人兴奋的。惊喜行动，我们来了!
This is exciting. Operation Surprise Party, here we come!

980
01:02:17,814 --> 01:02:20,609
等等,什么?负的。我不能让你身处险境。
Wait, what? Negative. I can't put you in harm's way like that.

981
01:02:20,782 --> 01:02:22,492
怎么，你要一个人完成整个任务吗?
What, are you gonna do the whole mission alone?

982
01:02:22,659 --> 01:02:23,660
我能做到。
I can do it.

983
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:25,495
因为你这里有个霍桑。
Because you got a Hawthorne right here.

984
01:02:25,662 --> 01:02:29,208
我很感激。这样吧，如果我需要你，我会告诉你的。
And I appreciate that. Tell you what, I'll let you know if I need you.

985
01:02:29,374 --> 01:02:33,378
但在那之前我们还是尽量回到犰狳那里不要再
But until then let's just try to get back to the Armadillo without any more--

986
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:41,762
快跑!
Run!

987
01:02:46,808 --> 01:02:47,518
不!
No!

988
01:02:52,397 --> 01:02:53,232
什么?
What?

989
01:02:53,398 --> 01:02:55,150
它在追我! 回船上去！
It's after me! Go back to the ship!

990
01:02:55,317 --> 01:02:56,360
但是巴斯!
But Buzz!

991
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:00,864
巴斯光年任务日志。
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

992
01:03:03,909 --> 01:03:08,622
我被一个…只是一个巨大的机器人。
I'm being pursued by a... just a massive robot.

993
01:03:09,831 --> 01:03:12,793
我把它带走，其他人逃到船上去。
I'm leading it away while the others escape to the ship.

994
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:36,024
Buzz.

995
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:38,235
什么?你怎么知道我的名字?
What? How do you know my name?

996
01:03:39,611 --> 01:03:40,654
跟我来。
Come with me.

997
01:03:40,821 --> 01:03:41,822
什么?
What?

998
01:03:45,576 --> 01:03:48,203
这绝对违反了我的假释条例。
This is definitely a violation of my parole.

999
01:03:52,332 --> 01:03:54,334
来吧。我们走吧。
Come on. Let's get outta here.

1000
01:04:14,556 --> 01:04:15,596
Zurg。
Zurg.

1001
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:37,753
准备发射。惊喜派对行动又开始了。
Ready yourselves for launch. Operation Surprise Party is back on.

1002
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:38,921
什么?与我们?
What? With us?

1003
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:40,589
怎么，我要一个人完成整个任务吗?
What, am I gonna do the whole mission alone?

1004
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:44,301
我们还不能发射。我需要五分钟来安装线圈。
We can't launch yet. I need five minutes to install the coil.

1005
01:04:48,305 --> 01:04:49,973
我们不能在这坐五分钟。
We can't sit here for five minutes.

1006
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:51,715
这艘船仍然具有悬停能力。
The ship still has hover capabilities.

1007
01:04:51,799 --> 01:04:52,625
那我们就利用它们。
Then let's use them.

1008
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,704
我们可能会在火间歇泉里失去它们。
We might lose them in the fire geysers.

1009
01:05:12,913 --> 01:05:15,415
眨眼。你们俩去炸机器人。
Blink the way. You two, blast some robots.

1010
01:05:15,582 --> 01:05:16,959
但我们还没完成弹药训练。
But we haven't even finished our munitions training.

1011
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:18,836
能有多难?看。
How hard can it be? Look.

1012
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:21,526
我们有这些尖尖的东西。这个可能会爆炸。
We got these spiky things. And these one probably explode.

1013
01:05:21,713 --> 01:05:23,090
做你觉得对的事。
Just do whatever feels right.

1014
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:24,675
什么?你打算怎么办?
What? What are you gonna do?

1015
01:05:24,842 --> 01:05:26,760
我要和Boom先生跳舞。
I'm gonna dance with Mister Boom.

1016
01:05:32,766 --> 01:05:35,310
这是令人满意的。
Now that's satisfying.

1017
01:05:35,602 --> 01:05:36,645
百分之二十完成。
Twenty percent complete.

1018
01:05:36,812 --> 01:05:37,813
百分之一?
Out of a hundred?

1019
01:05:42,317 --> 01:05:44,611
他们正在逼近我们。那些间歇泉在哪里?
They're gaining on us. Where are those fire geysers?

1020
01:05:44,778 --> 01:05:45,779
正前方。
Dead ahead.

1021
01:05:45,946 --> 01:05:48,448
别担心，我知道每一寸... 小心！
Don't worry, I know every last inch of-- Watch out!

1022
01:05:59,543 --> 01:06:00,878
来，扔过来
Here, throw this.

1023
01:06:01,044 --> 01:06:02,796
等等-扔过来！
-Wait, hold on. -Throw it!

1024
01:06:10,218 --> 01:06:11,071
Zurg.

1025
01:06:12,556 --> 01:06:14,183
火间歇泉就在前面!
Fire geyser dead ahead!

1026
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:19,438
百分之五十完成。
Fifty percent complete.

1027
01:06:20,388 --> 01:06:21,248
Zurg。
Zurg.

1028
01:06:23,108 --> 01:06:25,319
嘿，这里有炸药!
Hey, we have explosives back here!

1029
01:06:31,491 --> 01:06:32,576
快!给我一些东西。
Quick! Give me something.

1030
01:06:40,569 --> 01:06:41,732
Zurg。
Zurg.

1031
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:49,793
百分之九十完成。
Ninety percent complete.

1032
01:06:49,968 --> 01:06:51,845
伊兹，你知道如何在飞行中传递能量吗?
Izzy, do you know how to transfer power on the fly?

1033
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:53,472
我在模拟器里做过。
I've done it in the simulator.

1034
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:55,015
好吧，马上就要成真了。
Well, it's about to get real.

1035
01:06:55,724 --> 01:06:58,143
你需要我帮忙吗?-当然不是。
-Do you need my help with anything? -Absolutely not.

1036
01:06:58,310 --> 01:06:59,353
完成了95%。

1037
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,396
准备推进器。绿色按钮。中间。

完成了。

01:07:04,608 --> 01:07:05,651
记得培训。
Remember from training.

1040
01:07:05,817 --> 01:07:07,986
你不是扣动扳机，而是扣动扳机。
You don't pull the trigger, you squeeze the trigger.

1041
01:07:08,153 --> 01:07:09,029
我知道。

1042

百分之百完成。

1046
01:07:17,663 --> 01:07:22,167
重新引导。好了，准备发射，当燃料电池。不!
Reboot. Okay, be ready to launch when the fuel cell is-- No!

1047
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:30,926
哦,不。
Oh, no.

1048
01:07:31,134 --> 01:07:31,927
爆炸!
Blast!

1049
01:07:37,307 --> 01:07:38,642
抓住水晶!

没有。
No.

1051
01:08:07,254 --> 01:08:08,255
我…
I...

1052
01:08:18,974 --> 01:08:20,017
Buzz.

1053
01:08:20,642 --> 01:08:21,643
我很抱歉。
I'm so sorry.

1054
01:08:22,728 --> 01:08:26,607
一切都发生得太快了，我…我只是…
Everything was happening so fast and I... I just...

1055
01:08:29,943 --> 01:08:31,737
我犯了个错误。
I made a mistake.

1056
01:08:33,029 --> 01:08:34,156
是的。
Yeah.

1057
01:08:37,033 --> 01:08:39,411
好吧，但我们还没说完，对吧?
Okay, but we're not done, right?

1058
01:08:39,995 --> 01:08:41,622
我们还能做点什么。
We can still do something.

1059
01:08:41,787 --> 01:08:44,041
依奇,环顾四周。
Izzy, look around.

1060
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:46,210
没什么可做的。
There is nothing to do.

1061
01:08:46,376 --> 01:08:49,921
任务……结束了。
The mission... It's over.

1062
01:08:50,671 --> 01:08:51,798
Buzz.

1063
01:08:52,256 --> 01:08:53,425
Buzz!

1064
01:08:53,591 --> 01:08:55,051
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

1065
01:08:55,219 --> 01:08:58,388
我只想一个人待着。
I just need to be by myself.

1066
01:09:01,308 --> 01:09:02,309
不!
No!

1067
01:09:08,564 --> 01:09:09,566
Buzz!

1068
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:13,569
Buzz.

1069
01:09:46,645 --> 01:09:50,439
什么……这是什么?我们在哪里?
What the... What is this? Where are we?

1070
01:09:51,483 --> 01:09:52,609
你是谁?
Who are you?

1071
01:09:52,901 --> 01:09:54,695
这就是问题所在。
Now that's the question.

1072
01:10:05,247 --> 01:10:07,082
你看起来不错，巴斯。
You look good, Buzz.

1073
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:09,334
爸爸?
Dad?

1074
01:10:09,585 --> 01:10:10,586
再猜一遍。
Guess again.

1075
01:10:25,475 --> 01:10:26,476
Sox?

1076
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:29,313
你好,Buzz
Hello, Buzz.

1077
01:10:30,189 --> 01:10:31,648
我不明白。
I don't understand.

1078
01:10:37,863 --> 01:10:39,156
都是我搞砸的。
I messed this all up.

1079
01:10:39,323 --> 01:10:41,283
嘿，这只是个误会。
Hey, it was just a mistake.

1080
01:10:41,783 --> 01:10:43,118
还记得你跟我说的吗?
Remember what you told me?

1081
01:10:43,994 --> 01:10:45,078
这一次是不同的。
This one's different.

1082
01:10:45,245 --> 01:10:46,246
为什么?
Why?

1083
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:47,831
因为它是我的!
Because it's mine!

1084
01:10:59,676 --> 01:11:02,596
我应该和我奶奶一样棒的。
I'm supposed to be as good as my grandma.

1085
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:05,265
我应该是霍桑家的人。
I'm supposed to be a Hawthorne.

1086
01:11:08,185 --> 01:11:09,353
但我不是。
But I'm not.

1087
01:11:22,699 --> 01:11:23,825
Buzz?

1088
01:11:25,994 --> 01:11:27,162
等一下，等一下。
Wait a minute, hold on.

1089
01:11:27,329 --> 01:11:28,622
你不是我。我是我。
You're not me. I am me.

1090
01:11:28,789 --> 01:11:29,831
你现在就是你。
You are you now.

1091
01:11:29,998 --> 01:11:32,000
但我是五十年后的你。
But I'm you 50 years from now.

1092
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:33,335
不可能有两个我。
Well, there can't be two mes.

1093
01:11:33,502 --> 01:11:35,003
但我们都在这里。
Yet here we both are.

1094
01:11:35,671 --> 01:11:37,047
好吧。如果你是我。
Okay then. If you're me.

1095
01:11:37,214 --> 01:11:40,634
我想找一个介于1到1273之间的数字。
I'm thinking of a number between one and-- 1273.

1096
01:11:40,801 --> 01:11:41,802
哇。
Whoa.

1097
01:11:42,775 --> 01:11:43,678
Zurg.

1098
01:11:43,762 --> 01:11:45,097
是不是很可爱。
Isn't that cute.

1099
01:11:45,264 --> 01:11:46,974
机器人不会说“Buzz”。
Robots can't quite say "Buzz."

1100
01:11:47,182 --> 01:11:49,429
所以在这里我只是札克。
So around here I'm just Zurg.

1101
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:50,351
Zurg.

1102
01:11:50,435 --> 01:11:51,520
我猜你也是。
And I guess so are you.

1103
01:11:51,687 --> 01:11:52,688
怎么做?我不明白。
How? I don't understand.

1104
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:54,815
别担心。这些都不重要了。
Do not worry about it. None of this is gonna matter.

1105
01:11:54,982 --> 01:11:55,816
Buzz.

1106
01:11:55,983 --> 01:11:56,859
是吗?
Yes?

1107
01:11:57,025 --> 01:11:58,569
你得向他解释这一切。
You have to explain it all to him.

1108
01:11:59,361 --> 01:12:00,362
你是对的。
You're right.

1109
01:12:00,529 --> 01:12:02,823
抱歉，这太刺激了。
I'm sorry, it's just exciting.

1110
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:04,449
你终于来了。
You're finally here.

1111
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:07,077
看，我也达到了超高速。
See, I reached hyper-speed too.

1112
01:12:07,494 --> 01:12:08,954
扫兴。
Hyper-speed.

1113
01:12:09,663 --> 01:12:11,206
喜欢你所做的。
Like you did.

1114
01:12:12,082 --> 01:12:14,459
但我并没有被当成英雄来欢迎。
But I wasn't greeted as a hero.

1115
01:12:15,419 --> 01:12:20,382
不，那个新指挥官要以偷XL-15的罪名逮捕我。
No, that new Commander was gonna arrest me for stealing the XL-15.

1116
01:12:20,549 --> 01:12:24,178
我找到了让他们回家的方法，但他们根本不在乎。
I'd found a way to get them home, and they didn't even care.

1117
01:12:24,344 --> 01:12:25,304
所以我逃了出来。
So I escaped.

1118
01:12:30,767 --> 01:12:34,021
我尽我所能，以最快的速度去了。
I went as far as I could, as fast as I could.

1119
01:12:34,688 --> 01:12:37,941
以这样的速度，我已经旅行了几个世纪。
At that speed for that long I'd traveled centuries.

1120
01:12:38,108 --> 01:12:41,904
我的未来你都认不出来。
And I ended up in a future you wouldn’t recognize.

1121
01:12:42,112 --> 01:12:44,698
充满了你无法想象的科技。
Filled with technology you can't imagine.

1122
01:12:45,073 --> 01:12:47,534
就在那时我明白了。
And that's when it dawned on me.

1123
01:12:47,701 --> 01:12:50,954
如果我们能用这块水晶让时间前进。
If we can use this crystal to go forward in time.

1124
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:53,373
为什么不用它回去呢?
Why not use it to go back?

1125
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:55,209
但我们不能回到过去。
But we can't go back in time.

1126
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:57,169
我们现在可以。-什么?
-We can now. -What?

1127
01:12:57,377 --> 01:13:00,339
听着，巴斯，我打破了时间。
Listen, Buzz, I've broken time.

1128
01:13:00,506 --> 01:13:03,511
发生在你身上的事从没发生在我身上。
What's happening to you never happened to me.

1129
01:13:03,717 --> 01:13:07,054
这是一个从未有过的全新的现在。
This is a new now that's never been lived.

1130
01:13:07,221 --> 01:13:09,681
巴斯，我们可以改变现状。
You see, we can change things, Buzz.

1131
01:13:09,848 --> 01:13:15,020
如果我们能回到过去我们就能阻止自己登陆那个星球。
Well, if we can go back in time we can stop ourselves from ever landing on that planet.

1132
01:13:15,187 --> 01:13:16,355
永远不会撞到那座山。
From ever hitting that mountain.

1133
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:17,856
我们可以继续回家的任务。
We can just continue the mission home.

1134
01:13:18,023 --> 01:13:19,650
这一切都不会发生。
And none of this will have ever happened.

1135
01:13:20,317 --> 01:13:21,735
这是个好计划。
it's a good plan.

1136
01:13:22,027 --> 01:13:24,404
而这块水晶就是一切的关键。
And this crystal is the key to it all.

1137
01:13:24,571 --> 01:13:26,031
等等，你不是已经有了吗?
Wait, don't you already have one?

1138
01:13:26,198 --> 01:13:27,699
嗯,有点。
Well, sort of.

1139
01:13:28,992 --> 01:13:32,412
我在测试时间旅行时磨坏了我的水晶。
See, I wore my crystal out testing the time travel.

1140
01:13:32,579 --> 01:13:34,748
我也累坏了。这花了一段时间。
Wore myself out too. It took a while.

1141
01:13:34,915 --> 01:13:37,334
事实证明这并不是一门精确的科学。
Turns out this isn't an exact science.

1142
01:13:37,501 --> 01:13:40,045
这是我能找到的最久远的年代了。
This is as far back in time as I could get.

1143
01:13:40,212 --> 01:13:42,381
来，帮我配置引擎。
Come on, help me configure the engine.

1144
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:43,715
看起来应该很眼熟。
It should look familiar.

1145
01:13:43,882 --> 01:13:45,884
等等，这是基于萝卜吗?
Wait, is this based on the turnip?

1146
01:13:46,051 --> 01:13:47,719
设置反向推进器，满推进器。
Set it for reversed thrusters, full.

1147
01:13:50,347 --> 01:13:51,849
所以这些都是我们设计的?
So, we designed all of this?

1148
01:13:52,057 --> 01:13:54,560
不，这些都是借来的。
No, this is all borrowed.

1149
01:13:54,726 --> 01:13:56,436
我只是做了一些修改。
I just made some modifications.

1150
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:05,320
她又能当太空骑警了，巴斯。
She'll get to be a Space Ranger again, Buzz.

1151
01:14:06,905 --> 01:14:07,990
是的。
Yeah.

1152
01:14:08,407 --> 01:14:10,409
尽管……什么?
Although... What?

1153
01:14:10,617 --> 01:14:13,537
她将失去她的家人。
Well, she won't have her family.

1154
01:14:14,121 --> 01:14:15,163
她不会要伊兹的。
She won't have Izzy.

1155
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:16,456
依奇是谁?
Who's Izzy?

1156
01:14:17,249 --> 01:14:22,598
听着，如果她一开始就没见过谁她就不会想念谁，对吧?
Look, she's not gonna miss anyone if she never meets them in the first place, right?

1157
01:14:23,922 --> 01:14:27,551
人们只会知道我们完成了任务。
The only thing people are gonna know is that we finished our mission.

1158
01:14:29,052 --> 01:14:31,221
这里。把你的水晶递给我。
Here. Hand me your crystal.

1159
01:14:34,141 --> 01:14:35,142
Buzz?

1160
01:14:36,143 --> 01:14:39,521
我不知道，也许…也许我们应该考虑一下。
I don't know, maybe... maybe we should think about this.

1161
01:14:39,688 --> 01:14:41,064
思考什么?
Think about what?

1162
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:44,443
霍桑指挥官相信我们能弥补我们犯下的错误。
Commander Hawthorne believed we could fix this mistake we made.

1163
01:14:44,943 --> 01:14:47,321
而这种信念让她失去了一切。
And that belief cost her everything.

1164
01:14:47,946 --> 01:14:50,365
哦，不，不。我们完全错了。
Oh, no, no. We had that all wrong.

1165
01:14:50,532 --> 01:14:52,242
她在那里生活了一辈子。
She had a whole life down there.

1166
01:14:52,409 --> 01:14:53,911
什么样的生活?
What kind of life?

1167
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:57,080
我们应该是太空游骑兵。
We're supposed to be Space Rangers.

1168
01:14:57,706 --> 01:14:59,333
我们应该是重要的。
We suppose to matter.

1169
01:15:00,083 --> 01:15:02,544
你不想这样生活的，巴斯。
You don't wanna live like this, Buzz.

1170
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:05,839
在同样的噩梦中醒来。
Waking up with that same nightmare.

1171
01:15:06,006 --> 01:15:08,342
被你的错误所困扰。
Haunted by your mistake.

1172
01:15:08,509 --> 01:15:10,886
但你终于可以放下了。
But you can finally let go of that.

1173
01:15:11,345 --> 01:15:13,013
现在开始。
Starting right now.

1174
01:15:15,516 --> 01:15:16,517
你是对的。
You're right.

1175
01:15:17,643 --> 01:15:19,019
我能。
I can.

1176
01:15:20,896 --> 01:15:21,897
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

1177
01:15:22,648 --> 01:15:24,525
你和我，我们不一样。
You and me, we're not the same.

1178
01:15:25,192 --> 01:15:26,777
对不起。
I'm sorry.

1179
01:15:26,944 --> 01:15:28,111
不,Buzz
No, Buzz.

1180
01:15:28,987 --> 01:15:30,113
对不起。
I'm sorry.

1181
01:15:43,335 --> 01:15:44,294
嘿,猫。
Hey, cat.

1182
01:15:44,461 --> 01:15:45,879
你知道怎么开这玩意吗?
Do you know how to fly this thing?

1183
01:15:46,046 --> 01:15:47,339
没有燃料。
There's no fuel.

1184
01:15:47,506 --> 01:15:50,425
看，这就是为什么我们不该做超出我们能力范围的事。
See, this is why we should never have gotten in over our heads.

1185
01:15:50,592 --> 01:15:51,510
你想做什么?
What did you wanna do?

1186
01:15:51,677 --> 01:15:53,220
在前哨站等机器人找到我们吗?
Wait at the outpost until the robots found us?

1187
01:15:53,387 --> 01:15:55,013
那总比困在这里强。
That's better than being stranded out here.

1188
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,515
没人会找到我们的地方。
where no one's ever gonna find us.

1189
01:15:56,688 --> 01:15:59,983
你是我最不想在生死关头和你在一起的人。
You are the last person I wanna be stuck with in a life-and-death situation.

1190
01:16:00,143 --> 01:16:01,270
好吧，你很幸运。明白吗?
Well, you're in luck. Okay?

1191
01:16:01,436 --> 01:16:03,647
导致环顾四周。这只是死亡状况
Cause look around. This is just a death situation.

1192
01:16:03,814 --> 01:16:05,566
喵喵。
Meow meow.

1193
01:16:07,234 --> 01:16:08,652
我完全失去了巴斯。
I've completely lost Buzz.

1194
01:16:09,695 --> 01:16:11,071
他太远了，追踪不到。
He's too far away to track.

1195
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:28,922
每个人,里面!
Everybody, inside!

1196
01:16:29,089 --> 01:16:29,923
什么?
What?

1197
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,551
到船里面去。
Get inside the ship.

1198
01:16:35,262 --> 01:16:36,263
现在是什么在找我们?
What's after us now?

1199
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:37,431
我们没有武器了。
We don't have any more weapons.

1200
01:16:37,598 --> 01:16:38,932
没关系。我们要离开这里。
It's okay. We're getting out of here.

1201
01:16:39,092 --> 01:16:40,177
我们要去哪里?
Where are we going?

1202
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:41,768
我们要进入太空了。
We're going into space.

1203
01:16:45,397 --> 01:16:47,191
嘿，放开我。不!
Hey, let go of me. No!

1204
01:16:48,609 --> 01:16:51,653
我不明白这是怎么回事，巴斯。
I don't understand what's happening here, Buzz.

1205
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:53,530
你已经改变了。
You've changed.

1206
01:16:53,697 --> 01:16:55,699
而且不是更好。
And not for the better.

1207
01:16:55,866 --> 01:16:56,867
不!
No!

1208
01:16:57,034 --> 01:16:59,828
你不能这么做。你会把一切都抹去的。
You can't do this. You're gonna erase it all.

1209
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:01,455
完全正确。
Exactly.

1210
01:17:02,497 --> 01:17:04,374
不，你会夺走一切。
No, you gonna take away everything.

1211
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:06,919
人们的家人，朋友。
People's families, their friends.

1212
01:17:07,085 --> 01:17:08,504
我的朋友。
My friends.

1213
01:17:08,962 --> 01:17:10,672
他们在那个星球上生活。
They have lives on that planet.

1214
01:17:10,839 --> 01:17:12,299
每个人都一样。
Everyone does.

1215
01:17:12,841 --> 01:17:14,092
除了我们。
Except for us.

1216
01:17:15,427 --> 01:17:18,055
我几乎认不出你了，巴斯。
I hardly recognize you, Buzz.

1217
01:17:18,639 --> 01:17:22,768
所有这些新想法……你知道吗?
All these new ideas... You know what?

1218
01:17:22,935 --> 01:17:24,978
我们把这些也擦掉。
We'll go ahead and erase those too.

1219
01:17:27,607 --> 01:17:28,815
-啊。-我给你买了五分钟。
-Whoa. -I bought you five minutes.

1220
01:17:28,982 --> 01:17:29,942
为什么?
Why?

1221
01:17:30,108 --> 01:17:31,318
我喜欢这个新的你。
I like this new you.

1222
01:17:33,153 --> 01:17:34,988
我们必须摧毁这艘船。
We have to destroy this ship.

1223
01:17:35,405 --> 01:17:36,532
你能带我去舰桥吗?
Can you get me to the bridge?

1224
01:17:36,698 --> 01:17:37,783
当然。跟我来。
Certainly. Follow me.

1225
01:17:45,061 --> 01:17:45,955
Zurg。
Zurg.

1226
01:17:49,711 --> 01:17:52,005
惊喜派对行动，开始了。
Operation Surprise Party, here we go.

1227
01:17:52,207 --> 01:17:53,187
攻击,攻击!
Zap, zap!

1228
01:17:54,174 --> 01:17:55,676
我们得保护我们的逃生船。
We need to protect our escape ship.

1229
01:17:55,843 --> 01:17:57,678
所以，不要让任何机器人从那扇门进来。
So, don't let any robots come through that door.

1230
01:17:57,845 --> 01:17:59,054
别担心，我们会把它封起来。
Don't worry, we'll seal it off.

1231
01:17:59,221 --> 01:18:00,222
你去找巴斯。
You go find Buzz.

1232
01:18:00,389 --> 01:18:01,765
我会追踪他身份牌上的芯片。
I'll track the chip in his dog tags.

1233
01:18:01,932 --> 01:18:03,100
喵喵。
Meow meow.

1234
01:18:04,309 --> 01:18:05,310
怎么了?
What's wrong?

1235
01:18:05,483 --> 01:18:08,069
我收到两个巴斯的信号。不可能。
I'm getting two Buzz signals. That's can't be right.

1236
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:10,691
我会满足。这样我们就足够接近了。来吧。
I'll triangulate. That will get us close enough. Come on.

1237
01:18:11,859 --> 01:18:13,277
一个快捷方式。
A shortcut back.

1238
01:18:21,743 --> 01:18:22,744
这很简洁。
This is pretty neat.

1239
01:18:22,911 --> 01:18:23,704
我们得走了。
We have to go.

1240
01:18:23,871 --> 01:18:24,872
是的,好的。
Yep, all right.

1241
01:18:33,213 --> 01:18:34,214
哦,太棒了。
Oh, great.

1242
01:18:34,381 --> 01:18:36,175
我对这些控制系统一无所知。
I don't know any of these controls.

1243
01:18:36,383 --> 01:18:37,384
等等。I.V.A.N.吗?
Wait. I.V.A.N.?

1244
01:18:37,551 --> 01:18:38,427
是的,船长?
Yes, Captain?

1245
01:18:38,594 --> 01:18:40,387
天啊，见到你真高兴。
Boy, am I glad to see you.

1246
01:18:40,554 --> 01:18:42,764
两分钟后启动自毁程序。
Initiate self-destruct sequence in two minutes.

1247
01:18:42,931 --> 01:18:45,559
你明白了。自毁倒计时开始。
You got it. Self-destruct countdown initiated.

1248
01:18:45,726 --> 01:18:48,228
巴斯，你不想要这些很酷的技术吗?
Buzz, you don't want any of this cool technology?

1249
01:18:48,395 --> 01:18:49,980
只有你，伙计，来吧。
Only you, buddy, come on.

1250
01:18:50,564 --> 01:18:51,815
叛徒!-不。
-Traitor! -No.

1251
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:54,902
够了!
Enough!

1252
01:18:57,446 --> 01:18:59,823
告诉我水晶在哪。
Just tell me where the crystal is.

1253
01:19:00,866 --> 01:19:02,618
好吧，我们得保护我们的逃生船。
Okay, we've gotta protect our escape ship.

1254
01:19:02,784 --> 01:19:04,119
那我们怎么关上这扇门?
So, how do we close this door?

1255
01:19:04,286 --> 01:19:05,204
我不知道。
I don't know.

1256
01:19:05,363 --> 01:19:06,698
什么?你说"别担心，我们会把它封起来的"
What? You said, "don't worry we'll seal it off."

1257
01:19:06,872 --> 01:19:08,624
对，所以别担心。我们会的。
Right, so don't worry. We will.

1258
01:19:09,917 --> 01:19:10,918
我们开始吧。
Here we go.

1259
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:12,586
看,看到了什么?
Look, see?

1260
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:13,921
什么?
What?

1261
01:19:20,344 --> 01:19:21,386
喵喵。
Meow meow.

1262
01:19:21,553 --> 01:19:23,138
现在信号更紧了。
The signal is tighter now.

1263
01:19:23,305 --> 01:19:24,515
他必须笔直地走这边。
He has to be straight this way.

1264
01:19:26,642 --> 01:19:28,227
这是很大的空间。
That's a lot of space.

1265
01:19:28,393 --> 01:19:30,354
保持在一起。保持在一起。
Keep it together. Keep it together.

1266
01:19:30,896 --> 01:19:32,314
不!
No!

1267
01:19:33,732 --> 01:19:36,860
我不明白你的意思。信号显示巴斯在50米外。
I don't understand. The signal says Buzz is 50 meters away.

1268
01:19:37,819 --> 01:19:39,696
他在那里。
He's over there.

1269
01:19:41,281 --> 01:19:42,991
你觉得我们不一样吗，巴斯?
You think we're not the same, Buzz?

1270
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:46,161
你已经是我了，只是你还不知道。
You're already me, you just don't know it yet.

1271
01:19:46,328 --> 01:19:47,746
我永远都不会成为你!
I'm never gonna be you!

1272
01:19:47,913 --> 01:19:51,250
如果你不是我你就不是任何人。
If you're not gonna be me you're not gonna be anyone.

1273
01:19:54,795 --> 01:19:56,797
人工重力的。
Artificial gravity disengaged.

1274
01:19:57,047 --> 01:19:58,173
爆炸。
Blast.

1275
01:19:59,091 --> 01:20:00,092
不,不。
No, no.

1276
01:20:05,472 --> 01:20:07,307
-嘿，你在干什么?演绎一个炸弹。
-Hey, what are you doing? -Building a bomb.

1277
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:08,559
很好，你需要笔吗?
Nice, do you need a pen?

1278
01:20:08,725 --> 01:20:09,643
没有。这里。
No. Here.

1279
01:20:10,853 --> 01:20:11,854
噢,谢谢你。
Oh, thank you.

1280
01:20:12,521 --> 01:20:13,522
薄荷。
Peppermint.

1281
01:20:13,689 --> 01:20:14,731
把包装纸给我。
Give me the wrapper.

1282
01:20:14,898 --> 01:20:17,192
所以你可以用那些东西做个炸弹吗?
So, you can just build a bomb out of that stuff?

1283
01:20:17,365 --> 01:20:18,867
我用更少的钱工作。现在把口香糖给我。
I worked with less. Now give me the gum.

1284
01:20:19,027 --> 01:20:21,029
等等，我还没吃完呢，还有很多味道呢。
Wait, I'm not done, there's still a lot of flavor left.

1285
01:20:21,196 --> 01:20:22,197
来吧!
Come on!

1286
01:20:23,657 --> 01:20:26,285
在那里。当他们踩到它时，它就会爆炸。
There. When they step on it it will blow up.

1287
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:27,536
如果他们不踩上去怎么办?
What if they don't step on it?

1288
01:20:27,703 --> 01:20:29,663
我是说，我不会踩上去的，你呢?
I mean, I wouldn't step on that, would you?

1289
01:20:30,622 --> 01:20:32,833
那我们得往上面放点重物。
Then we need to drop something heavy on it.

1290
01:20:39,339 --> 01:20:40,883
就会……-不!
-Just gonna... -No!

1291
01:20:50,726 --> 01:20:51,727
Buzz?

1292
01:20:51,894 --> 01:20:53,103
Buzz!

1293
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:54,271
Alisha?

1294
01:20:55,731 --> 01:20:57,274
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

1295
01:20:59,234 --> 01:21:02,988
没有。我一个人做不到。我需要帮助。
No. I can't do it alone. I need help.

1296
01:21:03,356 --> 01:21:06,484
我不是我奶奶。
I'm not my grandma.

1297
01:21:06,658 --> 01:21:11,079
伊兹，我不需要你奶奶，我需要你。
Izzy, I don't need your grandma, I need you.

1298
01:21:13,415 --> 01:21:14,917
Sox，我们怎么过去?
Sox, how do we get over there?

1299
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:16,084
通过气闸。
Through the airlock.

1300
01:21:17,294 --> 01:21:18,337
通过在吗?
Through there?

1301
01:21:18,504 --> 01:21:19,630
外面什么都没有。
There's nothing out there.

1302
01:21:19,796 --> 01:21:21,590
完全正确。没有什么妨碍你。
Exactly. Nothing in your way.

1303
01:21:21,757 --> 01:21:23,217
你就一直走过去。
You just go straight across.

1304
01:21:23,383 --> 01:21:24,384
不!
No!

1305
01:21:27,179 --> 01:21:29,973
让我把话说清楚，当这个落在你的炸弹上-它肯定会爆炸。-是的。
Let me get this straight, when this falls on your bomb -it will definitely explode. -Yes.

1306
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:31,141
-那就会把门封上?-是的。
-And that will seal the door? -Yes.

1307
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:32,851
但我们最好快点。
But we better hurry.

1308
01:21:33,018 --> 01:21:34,228
我匆匆。
I am hurrying.

1309
01:21:34,853 --> 01:21:36,480
你为什么不快点?
Why don't you hurry?

1310
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:39,066
来吧。
Come on.

1311
01:21:51,703 --> 01:21:52,371
好吧。
Okay.

1312
01:21:55,332 --> 01:21:57,584
来吧,依奇。
Come on, Izzy.

1313
01:21:57,751 --> 01:21:59,378
你得到这个。
You got this.

1314
01:22:00,671 --> 01:22:02,172
哦,男人。
Oh, man.

1315
01:22:04,675 --> 01:22:06,009
哦,不。
Oh, no.

1316
01:22:07,052 --> 01:22:10,722
不要往下看，也不要往上看。这是所有空间。
Just don't look down, or up. It's all space.

1317
01:22:11,265 --> 01:22:13,225
它无处不在。所有你周围。
It's everywhere. All around you.

1318
01:22:13,934 --> 01:22:15,853
抱歉，我可能帮不上忙。
I'm sorry, I'm probably not helping.

1319
01:22:16,019 --> 01:22:17,229
直接。
Just go straight.

1320
01:22:17,938 --> 01:22:20,774
一旦你把它推开，你就会朝着那个方向前进。
Once you push off that the direction you'll go.

1321
01:22:21,733 --> 01:22:23,110
但如果我错过了呢?
But what if I miss?

1322
01:22:23,777 --> 01:22:24,862
不要错过。
Don't miss.

1323
01:22:58,270 --> 01:22:59,229
什么?哦,不。
What? Oh, no.

1324
01:22:59,605 --> 01:23:00,939
不,不!
No, no!

1325
01:23:09,615 --> 01:23:10,490
哇!
Whoa!

1326
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:13,202
Sox!

1327
01:23:19,499 --> 01:23:20,501
谢谢你,依奇。
Thank you, Izzy.

1328
01:23:35,724 --> 01:23:37,226
没有办法进去。
There is no way in.

1329
01:23:37,392 --> 01:23:38,644
也许我能帮忙。
Perhaps I could help.

1330
01:23:46,568 --> 01:23:48,612
你瞒不过我的，巴斯。
You can't hide for me, Buzz.

1331
01:23:48,779 --> 01:23:50,822
这就像在躲避自己。
It's like hiding from yourself.

1332
01:23:51,073 --> 01:23:52,866
我会一直找到你的。
I'll always find you.

1333
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:20,352
手动激活。
Manual override activated.

1334
01:24:33,782 --> 01:24:34,908
Buzz!-现在!
-Buzz! -Now!

1335
01:24:41,874 --> 01:24:43,125
来吧，我们离开这里!
Come on, let's get outta here!

1336
01:24:43,292 --> 01:24:44,418
我们得把船炸了。
We have to blow up the ship.

1337
01:24:44,585 --> 01:24:46,003
没时间了。我们不会成功的。
There's no time. We'll never make it.

1338
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:47,671
哦，是的，我们会的。
Oh, yes, we will.

1339
01:24:55,596 --> 01:25:02,060
自毁程序在十分钟内完成…-…九,八……-I.V.A.N。?I.V.A.N. !
Self-destruct sequence complete in ten... -...nine, eight... -I.V.A.N.? I.V.A.N.!

1340
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:03,707
Zurg.

1341
01:25:05,814 --> 01:25:06,899
达比，我们必须投降。
Darby, we have to surrender.

1342
01:25:07,065 --> 01:25:09,234
不!我不会放弃的。
No! I am not giving up.

1343
01:25:09,401 --> 01:25:11,528
是啊，我也不是，等等。
Yep, neither am I. Hold on.

1344
01:25:19,453 --> 01:25:21,538
-…五、四……我们走
-...five, four... -Let's go.

1345
01:25:22,206 --> 01:25:24,541
-…三,二…所有人，上车
-...three, two... -Everyone, get in.

1346
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:25,959
……一
...one.

1347
01:26:21,765 --> 01:26:22,933
巴斯光年任务日志。
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

1348
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:25,686
我们摧毁了札克的飞船和札克本人。
We've destroyed the Zurg's ship and Zurg himself.

1349
01:26:25,853 --> 01:26:31,191
现在我只要追上犰狳就行了要去什么地方?
Now I just have to catch up to the Armadillo in order to-- Going somewhere?

1350
01:26:32,359 --> 01:26:34,653
警告，引擎损坏是灾难性的。
Warning, engine damage is catastrophic.

1351
01:26:36,738 --> 01:26:45,914
巴斯光年任务日志。我现在拥有了水晶，终于可以，终于可以完成任务了。
Buzz Lightyear mission log. I now have the crystal in my possession, and can finally, at long last finish the mission.

1352
01:26:46,164 --> 01:26:48,667
我要回去重新发挥作用，巴斯。
I'm gonna go back and matter again, Buzz.

1353
01:26:49,084 --> 01:26:50,210
你呢?
And you?

1354
01:26:50,395 --> 01:26:52,939
你会像从没来过这里一样。
You will be like you have never here.

1355
01:26:53,589 --> 01:26:56,466
准备死。
Prepare to die.

1356
01:27:02,181 --> 01:27:03,432
不是今天,Zurg。
Not today, Zurg.

1357
01:27:12,232 --> 01:27:14,234
我们已经进入了行星的引力。
We've entered the planet's gravitational pull.

1358
01:27:14,401 --> 01:27:15,360
我们会坠机吗?
Are we gonna crash?

1359
01:27:15,527 --> 01:27:16,653
恐怕是这样的。
I'm afraid so.

1360
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:31,293
Buzz!

1361
01:27:45,057 --> 01:27:46,225
我做不到。
I can't do it.

1362
01:27:46,391 --> 01:27:48,227
Buzz,没关系。
Buzz, it's okay.

1363
01:27:48,393 --> 01:27:49,228
我们可以。
We can.

1364
01:27:50,395 --> 01:27:51,855
你能保持船平稳吗?
Can you keep the ship steady?

1365
01:27:52,272 --> 01:27:53,857
是的。我想是的。
Yeah. I think so.

1366
01:27:57,402 --> 01:28:01,490
好了，Sox，把应急电池熔在一起那是飞行控制的动力。
Okay, Sox, fuse the emergency battery the power of flight controls.

1367
01:28:01,907 --> 01:28:02,908
明白了。
Got it.

1368
01:28:03,992 --> 01:28:04,993
我需要一个副驾驶。
I'll need a co-pilot.

1369
01:28:06,042 --> 01:28:08,169
但我只在模拟器中做过。
Okay, but I've only done this in the simulator.

1370
01:28:08,372 --> 01:28:09,957
好吧，马上就要成真了。
Well, it's about to get real.

1371
01:28:10,214 --> 01:28:16,922
记住，拉回操纵杆-放松。是的。对不起。从现在开始慢慢来。
Remember, pull back on the yoke-- -Easy. -Yep. Sorry. Nice and easy from now on.

1372
01:28:18,966 --> 01:28:20,092
没用!
It's not working!

1373
01:28:20,259 --> 01:28:21,844
我们进去太快了。
We're going in too fast.

1374
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:23,136
-I.V.A.N。-是的,船长?
-I.V.A.N. -Yes, Captain?

1375
01:28:23,303 --> 01:28:25,389
-我们开得太快了。祝贺你!
-We're going too fast. -Congratulations!

1376
01:28:26,849 --> 01:28:28,809
我们不需要五彩纸屑，我们需要刹车!
We don't need confetti, we need brakes!

1377
01:28:28,969 --> 01:28:29,636
哦,我知道!
Oh, I know!

1378
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:31,436
——空气制动!在地板上。
-The air brake! -On the floor.

1379
01:28:31,603 --> 01:28:32,688
Darby!

1380
01:28:33,564 --> 01:28:35,357
-卡住了。-什么?
-It's stuck. -What?

1381
01:28:35,524 --> 01:28:36,984
盖子卡住了。
The cover, it's stuck.

1382
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:40,821
我需要一把螺丝起子，或者一个理发器之类的小楔子。
I need a screwdriver, or a hair clipper Some sort of a small wedge.

1383
01:28:41,864 --> 01:28:43,532
我拿到笔了!
I've got the pen!

1384
01:29:03,468 --> 01:29:05,012
Buzz!-大家都没事吧?
-Buzz! - Is everyone okay?

1385
01:29:05,179 --> 01:29:06,885
-是的。我是这样认为的。
-Yeah. -I think so.

1386
01:29:08,515 --> 01:29:10,434
警察!每一个人,快跑!
The cops! Everybody, run!

1387
01:29:10,601 --> 01:29:13,061
等等。只是救援队而已。
Wait. It's just the rescue team.

1388
01:29:13,896 --> 01:29:15,522
对。好吧。
Right. Okay.

1389
01:29:16,315 --> 01:29:19,610
你看起来是个好公民。是什么导致你入狱的?
You seem like a decent citizen. What led to your incarceration?

1390
01:29:19,776 --> 01:29:21,361
我偷了一艘船。
I stole a ship.

1391
01:29:22,571 --> 01:29:28,327
我们当中谁没有偷过一艘船…相对绝望?
Who among us hasn't stolen a ship in a moment of... relative desperation?

1392
01:29:28,493 --> 01:29:31,705
我是个有资源的人。我的武器是独创性。
I'm a man of resources. My weapon is ingenuity.

1393
01:29:31,872 --> 01:29:33,248
我什么都能做!
I can do anything!

1394
01:29:33,415 --> 01:29:34,666
你能别对着我耳朵嚷嚷吗?
Can you not shout in my ear?

1395
01:29:34,833 --> 01:29:35,959
是的,抱歉。
Yep, sorry.

1396
01:29:46,671 --> 01:29:47,672
你明白吗?
You're okay?

1397
01:29:47,763 --> 01:29:50,599
su.b . t我在太空。
su.b .T I was in space.

1398
01:29:52,392 --> 01:29:54,228
你奶奶会为你感到骄傲的。
Your grandma would be proud.

1399
01:29:55,562 --> 01:29:57,147
她也会为你骄傲的。
She'd be proud of you too.

1400
01:29:59,066 --> 01:30:00,776
她总是。
She always was.

1401
01:30:03,237 --> 01:30:05,155
等等。你的水晶呢?
Wait. Where is your crystal?

1402
01:30:05,781 --> 01:30:06,949
这是一去不复返了。
It's gone.

1403
01:30:07,115 --> 01:30:10,744
但是你的使命……你想回家。
But your mission... You wanted to go home.

1404
01:30:11,745 --> 01:30:17,501
这么长时间以来，我第一次有家的感觉。
You know, for the first time in a long time I feel like I am home.

1405
01:30:25,958 --> 01:30:26,801
Zurg。
Zurg.

1406
01:30:26,885 --> 01:30:28,011
当心!
Look out!

1407
01:30:30,441 --> 01:30:31,306
哇?
Whoa?

1408
01:30:37,271 --> 01:30:38,647
现在停止!
Stop right now!

1409
01:30:40,732 --> 01:30:42,150
光年。
Lightyear.

1410
01:30:43,694 --> 01:30:50,450
你带着星际司令部的财产潜逃，偷了实验飞船违抗了指挥官的直接命令。
You absconded with Star Command property, stolen experimental spacecraft and defied a direct order from your commander.

1411
01:30:50,610 --> 01:30:52,696
我要把你扔进寨子里。
I gotta throw you into stockade.

1412
01:30:54,204 --> 01:30:57,749
但我对你另有安排。
But I have other plans for you.

1413
01:30:59,126 --> 01:31:02,379
我们想让你建立一个新版本的太空游骑兵队。
We want you to start a new version of the Space Ranger Corps.

1414
01:31:02,546 --> 01:31:04,673
宇宙保护部门。
Universe Protection Division.

1415
01:31:04,882 --> 01:31:07,050
你会再次成为太空骑警的，巴斯。
You're gonna be a Space Ranger again, Buzz.

1416
01:31:09,178 --> 01:31:13,682
您可以手动选择您的团队从Zap巡逻的最好的和训练他们到您的喜欢。
You can hand-select your team from the very best of the Zap Patrol and train them to your liking.

1417
01:31:13,766 --> 01:31:14,869
攻击,攻击!
Zap, zap!

1418
01:31:16,977 --> 01:31:19,220
你真是太好了，先生。
Well, that's very kind of you, sir.

1419
01:31:19,304 --> 01:31:21,361
但恐怕我不得不拒绝。
But I'm afraid I'm going to have to decline.

1420
01:31:24,735 --> 01:31:26,153
我已经有我的团队了。
I already have my team.

1421
01:31:37,532 --> 01:31:41,036
这些新西装太棒了。爆破手，火箭翼。
These new suits are amazing. Arm blaster, rocket wings.

1422
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:42,377
不过它可能需要一支笔。
It could use a pen though.

1423
01:31:42,586 --> 01:31:45,631
真不敢相信我被允许带着这个。我希望我有两个。
I can't believe I'm allowed to carry this. I wish I had two of them.

1424
01:31:45,797 --> 01:31:48,217
你没有案底。你自由了，还有武器。
You got a clean record. and you're free and armed.

1425
01:31:48,383 --> 01:31:49,510
你还在抱怨什么?
How are you still complaining?

1426
01:31:49,676 --> 01:31:52,012
我因为行为好而被免职，不是因为态度好。
I got off for good behavior, not good attitude.

1427
01:31:52,179 --> 01:31:55,599
我从来不穿裤子，但突然觉得不穿裤子很奇怪。
You know, I never wear pants, but suddenly it feels weird to not be wearing pants.

1428
01:31:55,766 --> 01:31:56,934
不穿裤子会不会很奇怪?
Does it look weird without pants?

1429
01:31:57,093 --> 01:31:58,094
不，你看起来不错。
No, you look good.

1430
01:31:58,435 --> 01:31:59,561
我希望我能做到。
I wish I could pull that off.

1431
01:32:06,026 --> 01:32:09,279
看，奶奶，我是太空骑警。
Look, Grandma, I'm a Space Ranger.

1432
01:32:09,446 --> 01:32:10,906
就像你。
Just like you.

1433
01:32:22,167 --> 01:32:26,713
好了，队员们，我们在第四区的伽玛象限接收到一个信号。
All right, team, we've picked up a signal in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector 4.

1434
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:30,342
我们不知道它是什么，但我们不能等着它入侵我们的家园。
We don't know what it is, but we're not gonna wait for it to invade our home.

1435
01:32:30,509 --> 01:32:32,845
收到,指挥官。你可以信赖我们。
Copy, Commander. You can count on us.

1436
01:32:34,012 --> 01:32:37,391
巴斯光年任务日志。开始日期4071
Buzz Lightyear mission log. Star date 4071.

1437
01:32:37,558 --> 01:32:47,276
作为太空游骑兵部队宇宙精英保护部队的一员，我们的任务是保护银河系免受来自银河联盟死敌入侵的威胁。
As members of the Elite Universe Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps, we've been charged to protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion from any sworn enemies of The Galaxy Alliance.

1438
01:32:47,818 --> 01:32:50,362
好了，各位，确保系好了。
Okay, everyone, make sure you're securely fastened.

1439
01:32:50,529 --> 01:32:52,698
-们什么都有了吗？弹药？-检查。
-Do we have everything? Munitions? -Check.

1440
01:32:52,865 --> 01:32:54,199
食物? 我带了三明治。
-Sustenance? -I brought sandwiches.

1441
01:32:54,533 --> 01:32:55,993
你的肚子会没事吗?
And your tummy will be okay?

1442
01:32:56,326 --> 01:32:57,911
一切就绪。-好的。
-All set. -All right.

1443
01:32:58,996 --> 01:33:00,289
我忘了什么吗?
Am I forgetting anything?

1444
01:33:00,664 --> 01:33:02,082
我想我们准备好了。
I think we're ready.

1445
01:33:16,972 --> 01:33:20,100
你好，我是你的内部声控导航。
Hello, I am your internal voice-activated navigator.

1446
01:33:20,267 --> 01:33:21,727
很高兴你回来，静脉注射
Good to have you back, I.V.A.N.

1447
01:33:22,144 --> 01:33:23,645
光年船长，准备发射。
Captain Lightyear, ready for launch.

1448
01:33:23,937 --> 01:33:24,938
Sox? 喵?
-Sox? -Meow?

1449
01:33:29,318 --> 01:33:31,612
启动hyper-launch I.V.A.N。
I.V.A.N., initiate hyper-launch.

1450
01:33:31,778 --> 01:33:32,654
当然
Certainly.

1451
01:33:34,448 --> 01:33:36,909
好了，太空游骑兵。我们开始吧。
All right, Space Rangers. Here we go.

1452
01:33:37,075 --> 01:33:41,121
飞向无限和超越。
To infinity and beyond.

1453
01:35:57,382 --> 01:35:58,884
激光的盾牌。
Laser shield.

1454
01:43:37,217 --> 01:43:45,058
现在，如果你更喜欢一条风景优美的路线，你会想要向南走，经过溴酸沼泽，一个令人惊叹的景象，至少我是这样被告知的。
Now, should you prefer a more scenic route you'll want to head south past the bromite swamps, a breathtaking sight, or so I am told.

1455
01:43:45,225 --> 01:43:48,604
但如果你赶时间，这是最直接的路线。
But if you are in a hurry, this would be your most direct route.

1456
01:43:48,770 --> 01:43:49,980
有问题吗?
Any questions?

1457
01:43:51,023 --> 01:43:52,024
喂?
Hello?
