1995年, 一个叫安迪的男孩在生日时得到了一个巴斯光年玩具
In 1995, a boy named Andy got a Buzz Lightyear toy for his birthday.

3
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,889
这个玩具来自于他最喜欢的电影
It was from his favorite movie.

4
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:01,645
就是这部电影
This is that movie.

5
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:09,945
未知空间 距地球420万光年
UNCHARTED SPACE 4.2 MILLION LIGHT YEARS FROM EARTH

6
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:20,163
星际指挥部SC-01探索船 船员1200人
STAR COMMAND SC-01 EXPLORATION VESSEL CREW: 1200

7
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:45,939
巴斯光年任务日志 星际日期3901年
Buzz Lightyear mission log. Star date 3901.

8
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,108
传感器在一个未知星球上
Sensors have detected potential life forms.

9
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,401
检测到可能有生命存在
on an uncharted planet.

10
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,612
所以我们要绕道去调查一下
So, we're making a detour to investigate.

11
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,039
太空游侠会进行初步评估
Space Rangers will make initial evaluation,

12
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:04,208
然后决定是否唤醒冬眠中的
then assess whether it's worth waking the science crew

13
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,459
科学船员
from their hyper-sleep.

14
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,294
当ERIC采集核心样本时
While the ERIC takes core samples

15
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:13,217
我将探索一下这个陌生星球有没有什么奇怪地方
I will explore further the oddities of this strange planet.

16
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,901
地面看来有点不太稳定
Terrain seems a bit unstable.

17
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,612
还没有检测到此区域是否可以进行呼吸
No read-out yet if the area is breathable.

18
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,865
似乎没有任何智慧生命存在的迹象
There seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere.

19
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,742
-你在和谁说话？-没和谁
-Who are you talking to? -No one.

20
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,160
你又在自言自语
You were narrating again.

21
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,913
才不是呢 我在做任务日志呢
I was not. Just doing the mission log.

22
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,249
不会有人听你的日志的
You do know no one ever listens to them.

23
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,793
我知道 只不过这样能让我集中注意力
I know that, narrating helps me with focus.

24
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,545
-保持头脑敏锐 -好吧
-Stay sharp. -Yeah.

25
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,964
好吧 霍桑指挥官 如果你介意这个
Well, if it bothers you, Commander Hawthorne.

26
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,632
我很乐意回萝卜号上等着
I'm happy to wait back on the turnip.

27
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,175
请别叫它萝卜号
Please don't call it the turnip.

28
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,052
但这艘船看起就像个萝卜
But the ship looks like a root vegetable.

29
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:00,222
好啦 你在设计图预览时都说过了
Yes, you made that very clear at the design review.

30
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,733
你知道我自言自语有多久了?
How long have you known that I narrate?

31
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,944
从我们都还是学员的时候就一直这样
Forever. Since you and I were cadets.

32
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,196
说到这 你忘了带那个菜鸟来了
Speaking of, you forgot to take the rookie with you.

33
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,616
啊 霍桑指挥官 你知道我对菜鸟是什么感觉
Ah, Commander Hawthorne, you know how I feel about rookies.

34
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,493
这和我对自动驾驶的感觉一样
It's the same way I feel about autopilots.

35
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,246
"先生 有什么可以协助你的吗？有什么我可以做的吗？"
"How may I assist you? Is there anything I can do, sir?"

36
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,540
他们帮不上忙 却能把简单的事情复杂化
They don't help, they just over-complicate things.

37
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,458
所以我最好还是自己亲手来
I'm better off just doing the job myself.

38
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,210
所以我把菜鸟带来了
Which is why I brought the rookie.

39
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,671
你好
Hello.

40
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,924
-不是吧 -巴斯 规定要求我们把他带上
-No. -Buzz, protocol requires we bring him along.

41
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,301
-他的眼神会充满悲伤 -巴斯
-He's gonna have sad eyes. -Buzz.

42
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,927
你知道我受不了这种眼神
You know I can't deal with sad eyes.

43
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,137
-看看这个菜鸟 巴斯 -不
-Look at the rookie, Buzz. -No.

44
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:41,972
-看看这个菜... 看... -不... ...不
-Look at the roo...Look... -No...no.

45
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:42,890
-光年 -不
-Lightyear. -No.

46
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,057
-看看他 -不看
-Look at him. -Not looking.

47
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:44,975
-看 看 -不
-Look. Look. -No.

48
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,436
-看看这个菜鸟 -不 不
-Look at the rookie. -No. No.

49
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,066
好的 好吧 好吧 你赢了
All right. All right. You win.

50
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,654
瞧啊 费瑟... 费瑟汉姆斯坦...
Look, Feather...Featheringhamstan...

51
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:58,697
是费瑟林汉姆斯坦长官
It's Featheringhamstan, sir.

52
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,116
听着 菜鸟 首先 没人跟你说话你就闭嘴
Look, rookie, first, you will not speak unless spoken to.

53
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,201
-是的 长官 -我还没说完呢
-Yes, sir. -Still talking.

54
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,203
第二 尊重制服
Second, respect the suit.

55
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,079
这制服意味着什么
This suit means something.

56
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,082
它不仅仅是在保护你的身体 更是在保护整个宇宙
It's not just protecting your body, it's protecting the universe.

57
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,400
这制服是你对世界的承诺
This suit is a promise to the world that you,

58
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,547
最重要的事情是
and you alone will do one thing above all.

59
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,881
不惜一切代价完成任务
Finnish the mission no matter the cost.

60
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,884
你永远不能放弃 不管你在星际中遇见什么状况... ...
You will never quit, whatever the galaxy may throw your way--

61
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,511
关掉那个玩意！
Will you please turn that off!

62
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,013
这也太简单了
It's just too easy.

63
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,140
你在讽刺我 是吗？
You're mocking me, aren't you?

64
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,392
是的 但这是支持你的一种方式
Yeah, but in a supportive way.

65
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,604
听着 我想说的是 指挥官 我们俩已经把这项工作搞定了
Look, what I'm trying to say, Commander, is that you and I have this job down.

66
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:31,897
-长官 -我还没说完
-Sir. -Still talking.

67
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,691
在任何时候我都知道你在想什么 我知道你会去哪里
At any moment I know what you're thinking, I know where you're gonna be.

68
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,318
但这个人 我不知道
But this guy, I don't know.

69
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:37,569
他去哪了？
Where'd he go?

70
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,155
你看到了吗？这正是我要说的
You see? This is exactly what I'm talking about.

71
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,865
他不是在帮忙 人都没影了
He's not helping. He's wandered off.

72
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,700
是藤条！
Vines!

73
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:53,919
有虫子！
Bugs!

74
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,052
飞船正在往下陷
The ship. It's sinking.

75
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,512
各位 回到萝卜号上！
Everyone, back to the turnip!

76
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,013
哦 现在可以叫萝卜了
Oh, so now it's the turnip.

77
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:16,567
启动隐身模式 这应该为我们争取到足够的时间
Engage Stealth Mode. That should buy us enough time.

78
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,489
我们到不了了
We're not gonna make it.

79
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:23,991
就快到了！
Almost there!

80
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,619
好吧 执行B计划 准备好了吗？
Okay, plan B. Ready?

81
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:28,537
开始吧！
Go!

82
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,555
-该死！-我可以把它接好
-Blast! -Here, I can re-route it.

83
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,723
给我点时间
Just give me a minute.

84
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,099
那谁去哪儿了...
Where is the...

85
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,517
救命啊！
Help!

86
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:53,937
菜鸟
rookie.

87
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,314
救救我！
Help me!

88
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:59,193
巴斯光年任务日志 这个星球完全不适合居住
Buzz Lightyear mission log. The planet is clearly uninhabitable.

89
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,736
事实上 全是敌对生物
In fact, outright hostile.

90
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,364
会动的植物抓住了学员弗斯-费瑟林...
The sentient foliage have apprehended cadet Furth-Feathering...

91
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,573
费瑟林斯顿...费瑟...费瑟...
Featheringston...Feather...

92
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:06,537
他们抓走了菜鸟
They got the rookie,

93
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:09,178
那个我一开始就强烈反对他加入的...
who I strongly suggested should not have joined in the first--

94
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,372
该死的
Blast.

95
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,588
-巴斯！-现在！
-Buzz! -Now!

96
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:34,937
快走吧 游侠！
Move it, ranger!

97
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:39,149
我们正在返回船上的路上
Making our way back to the ship.

98
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,692
快点 巴斯！
Come on, Buzz!

99
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,737
快点！
Hurry!

100
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,369
引擎室一切正常
All good at the engine room.

101
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:51,537
-我去开飞船 -那我--
-I'll take the helm. -And I will--

102
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:52,829
什么都别做 我来就行
Do nothing. I've got this.

103
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,300
有什么需要我协助的吗？
How may I assist you?

104
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:06,218
自动导航仪
Autopilots.

105
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,886
-有什么我可以做的吗 先生？-没有 什么也没有！
-Is there anything I can do, sir? -No and no!

106
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,054
这可不是在玩模拟器
This is not a simulation.

107
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,683
指挥官 报告状态！
Commander, status!

108
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,684
燃油注入
Fuel engaged.

109
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:14,893
所有系统运行
All systems go.

110
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,610
警告 发射轨迹不正常
Warning. Launch trajectory unsound.

111
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,448
起来吧 起来吧
Come on. Come on.

112
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,660
即将发生碰撞
Collision imminent.

113
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,161
中止 中止
Abort. Abort.

114
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,629
光年船长 需要我帮忙吗？
Captain Lightyear, do you need my help?

115
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,256
-不需要 -你确定吗？
-Negative. -Are you sure?

116
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,967
我是巴斯光年 我总是很确定
I'm Buzz Lightyear. I'm always sure.

117
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,468
糟透了 巴斯
It's bad, Buzz.

118
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,515
光速驱动晶体完全损坏了
The hyper-speed crystal was totally destroyed.

119
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:38,434
长话短说 我们被困在这了
Long story short: we're marooned.

120
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,306
我不知道
I don't know.

121
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,398
你这是干什么?
What are you doing?

122
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,775
送自己上军事法庭
I'm court-martialing myself.

123
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:45,943
别 别这样
No. You're not.

124
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,530
霍桑指挥官 我特此解除自己太空游侠的职务
Commander Hawthorne, I hereby relieve myself of all Space Ranger duties.

125
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,115
这是我的错 这些人原本应该好好的
This was my fault. And these people deserve better.

126
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,867
你可以把我关起来
You can throw me in the brig.

127
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,411
完成任务 巴斯
Finish the mission, Buzz.

128
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:57,621
这就是我们应该做的
That's what we do.

129
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,123
但得等到所有人都回家了才算完成任务
We're not done until everyone gets home.

130
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,750
但我们没有燃料晶体
But we have no fuel crystal.

131
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,753
所以我们在这个星球上开采资源 制造一个新晶体
So we mine resources on this planet, create a new crystal.

132
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,630
晶体融合是非常不稳定的
Crystalic fusion is highly unstable.

133
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:07,756
那我们测试它
Then we test it.

134
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,633
不 这太危险了
No. It's too dangerous.

135
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,010
制造一块光速驱动晶体
Manufacturing a crystal capable of hyper-speed

136
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,388
就像试图把太阳套住
is like trying to lasso with the sun.

137
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,684
然后需要有人把太阳装到飞船上
And then someone would need to attach that sun to a ship,

138
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:22,980
然后需要有人来驾驶这艘船而不把自己炸成碎片
and then the ship needs someone to fly it without blowing themselves into oblivion.

139
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,023
谁会动这种念头...
Who in their right mind would...

140
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,369
巴斯光年任务日志 星际日期3902年
Buzz Lightyear mission log. Star date 3902.

141
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,803
在被困住一整年之后
After a full year of being marooned,

142
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,042
我们的专业人员
our specialized crew

143
00:09:41,126 --> 00:09:44,043
已经给这个星球的资源开发了不可思议的用途
have put this planet's vast resources to incredible use.

144
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:50,591
终于 我们将进行第一次光速试飞
Finally, our first hyper-speed test flight is a go.

145
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,527
准备好了吗 光年船长？
Ready, Captain Lightyear?

146
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,071
我准备好了 霍桑指挥官
Ready as I'll ever be, Commander Hawthorne.

147
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,239
飞向宇宙
To infinity.

148
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,490
浩瀚无垠
And beyond.

149
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,370
-嗡！-我们在外围有一个漏洞
-Buzz! -We got a breach in the perimeter.

150
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,667
拜托 我就...
Come on, I just...

151
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:26,668
光年船长！
Captain Lightyear!

艾尔曼·迪亚兹
Airman Diaz.

153
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,506
孩子们 今天藤条有那么点活跃 是吧？
Boy, the vines are a little feisty today, huh?

154
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:31,673
我们准备好发射了吗?
Are we ready to launch?

155
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,592
如果你准备好了 我们都准备好了 先生
We're all ready if you are, sir.

156
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,930
一年的工作只为了四分钟的飞行 这值得庆祝吗？
A year of work for a four minute flight. Isn't that something?

157
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,097
当然值得
Sure is.

158
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,767
好吧 我们去瞧瞧新的光速驱动燃料是否稳定
Well, let's go find out if this new hyper-speed fuel is stable.

159
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:43,810
这样我就可以让我们离开这块石头了
So I can get us off this rock.

160
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,396
差点忘了 这是你的I. V. A. N 先生
I almost forgot. Here's your I.V.A.N, sir.

161
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,606
充满电了

这是为你特别配制的混合燃料
Here is your specially formulated fuel mixture.

168
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,002
那么 这燃料能驱动到光速？
So, this is the fuel that's gonna reach hyper-speed?

169
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,630
有87.6%的机会
It has an 87.6 percent chance.

170
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,382
我接受这个概率
I'll take those odds.

171
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,099
祝你好运 船长
Good luck, Captain.

172
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,059

194
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,093
你的任务是加速穿越深空

196
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:46,016
然后通过减速环回到塔卡尼主星
then through the deceleration rings back here to T'kani Prime.

197
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:49,436

212
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,268
轨迹错误 偏移四度
Trajectory error, plus four degrees.

213
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,937
如果不纠正航向将错过减速环
Failure to course-correct will result in missing the rings.

214
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,190
我们会飞向深空
We'll fly off into deep space

215
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,608
那必死无疑
resulting in certain death.

216
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,026
是的 谢谢你
Yes, thank you.

217
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:20,777
弹射是你唯一选项
Ejection is your only option.

218
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:22,738
不 不 我能做到

警告 你有26秒的时间来纠正航线
Warning. You have 26 seconds to course-correct.

220
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:30,412
你现在有25秒的时间来纠正航向
You now have 25 seconds to course-correct.

221
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,164
-你现在有... -请停止倒数
-You now have-- -Stop counting, please.

222
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:35,626
我很抱歉 我的安全规定禁止我停止倒数
I'm sorry. My safety protocols prohibit me from terminating countdown.

223
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:36,835
自动导航仪

224
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,713
任务即将失败 请记录你的遗言
Mission failure imminent. Please record your last words.

225
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,758
不会是今天的 I.V.A.N.
Not today, I.V.A.N.

226
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,886
如果你对这个录音感到满意 请说话或选择1
If you are satisfied with this recording, speak or select 1.

227
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,722
I.V.A.N. 把引擎加到最大功率
I.V.A.N., push the engines all the way. Maximum power.

228
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,850
这样不行 燃料电池会爆炸...
That action is inadvisable. Fuel cell detonation--

229
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,977
我就想它爆炸呢
Is exactly what I'm counting on.

230
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,024
情况危急
Situation critical.

231
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,903
燃料电池接近峰值容量
Fuel cell approaching peak capacity.

232
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,446
打开燃料舱门 I. V. A. N.
Open up the Fuel Door, I.V.A.N.

233
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,156
很抱歉 我没听清
I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch that.

235
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,621
五分钟后引爆...
Detonation in five...

236
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:13,664
...四...
...four...

237
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,998
...三...
...three...

238
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,416
...二...
...two...

239
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,459
-... ...一 -现在！
-...one. -Now!

240
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,432
航线已纠正
Course corrected.

241
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:34,226
你没能到达光速
You failed to reach hyper-speed.

242
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:35,894
我不需要听这个 I. V. A. N.
I didn't need to hear that, I.V.A.N.

243
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,020
你没听到？
You didn't hear that?

244
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,188
哦 很抱歉 我再重复一遍
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll repeat.

245
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,649
-不 我听到了...我是说... -你没能到达光速
-No, I've heard-- I meant-- -You failed to reach hyper-speed.

246
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:41,859
-谢谢你 I. V. A. N. -你没达到...
-Thank you, I.V.A.N. -You failed to reach--

247
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,091
指挥官 你还好吗？
Commander, are you okay?

248
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,261
迪亚兹 你长胡子了
Diaz, you grew a beard.

249
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:10,637
你是怎么长出胡子的？
How did you grow a beard?

250
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:11,847
哦 对了
Oh, right.

251
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,640
首先 欢迎回来
First of, welcome back.

252
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:15,851
其次...
Secondly...

253
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:16,977
等等
Wait.

254
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,354
等等 这是什么？
Wait, what is this?

255
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:20,974
我离开了多长时间？
How long was I gone?

256
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,150
4年2个月零3天
Four years, two months and three days.

257
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,735
什么？
What?

258
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,069
我还以为我们失去你了 巴斯
I thought we've lost you, Buzz.

259
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,405
艾莉莎 发生了什么事？
Alisha, what happened?

260
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,616
-时间膨胀 -什么？
-Time dilation. -What?

261
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,659
时间膨胀很简单
Time dilation is quite simple.

262
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:36,705
当你接近光速时 你的时间相对于我们的时间就变慢了
As you approached hyper-speed, your time slowed relative to our own.

263
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:39,208
所以 在你的任务中 你只过了几分钟
So, during your mission you aged only minutes,

264
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,251
而我们其他人却老了很多年
while the rest of us have aged years.

265
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,045
简单地说：你飞得越快...
Simply put: The faster you fly--

266
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:46,590
我飞得越快 就越能穿越到未来
The faster I fly the further into the future I travel.

267
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:47,883
我明白了
I get it.

268
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,514
那么 我们现在要做什么呢？
So, what are we gonna do now?

269
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,806
我不知道
I don't know.

270
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:57,392
但我认为我们应该暂停测试飞行
But I think we should hold off on any more test flights

271
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,436
直到我们想出别的办法
until we've figured out something else.

272
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,730
指挥官 我们说过要完成任务
Commander, we said finish the mission.

273
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:03,106
这就是太空游侠的工作
That's what Space Rangers do.

274
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,691
以什么为代价呢 巴斯？
At what cost, Buzz?

275
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,319
你愿意再损失四年时间吗？
Are you willing to lose another four years?

276
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,953
所以 大家被困在这里
So, everyone is just stuck here

277
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,121
全是因为我
because of me.

278
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:30,300
嘿 你没事吧？
Hey, you all right?

279
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,053
是的 是的 我很好
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

280
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,430
等等 那是什么？
Wait, what's that?

281
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,850
哦 我订婚了
Oh, I got engaged.

282
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,853
哦 哇 那真是太好了 她叫什么名字？
Oh, wow. That's great. What's her name?

283
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,647
Kiko 她是科学小组的成员之一
Kiko. She's one of the science crew.

284
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:47,727
有趣的是 如果我们没被困住 这根本就不会发生
It's funny, it never would've mattered if we hadn't been stranded.

285
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:50,112
你和你刚认识的人订婚了？
You got engaged to someone you just met?

286
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,031
巴斯 我三年前就认识她了
Buzz, I met her three years ago.

287
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,409
哦 对 对
Oh, right. Right.

288
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,870
好吧 恭喜你 我很想见见她
Well, Congratulations. I'd love to meet her.

289
00:17:58,154 --> 00:18:00,873
嗯 有的是时间 休息一下吧
Well, there's plenty of time for that. Get some rest.

290
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,292
这是命令
That's an order.

291
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:11,425
别客气！艾莉莎
YOU'RE WELCOME! ALISHA

292
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:27,649
你好 巴斯！
Hello, Buzz!

293
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,486
我是索克斯 你的私人机器人伴侣
I am Sox. Your personal companion robot.

294
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:32,571
我的什么？
My what?

295
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:33,947
我是星际指挥部派来的
I was issued by star command

296
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:37,117
来缓解你失去时间后的情绪变化
to ease your emotional transition after your time away.

297
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,954
哦 你考虑得可真周到 机器猫
Oh, that's very considerate of you, robot feline.

298
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,331
不过不用了 谢谢你
But no thank you.

299
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,249
恐怕这是规定
I'm afraid it's protocol.

300
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,419
传感器显示你已经错过了四个生日
Sensors indicate you've missed four birthdays.

301
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:49,505
你想来一套糖霜零食庆祝个生日吗？
Would you like a frosted snack kit to celebrate?

302
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:52,299
不用了 那会影响到我的营养控制
Negative. That would compromise my nutritional regiment.

303
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,971
我们可以谈谈你的感受 我是一个出色的倾听者
We can talk about your feelings. I am an excellent listener.

304
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,267
不 不 听着 我有非常漫长的... ... 一天？
No, no. Look, I've had a very long... day?

305
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:03,727
它没有按计划发展
It did not go as planned.

306
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,771
任务没成功？
The mission was unsuccessful?

307
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,356
是的
Affirmative.

308
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:10,984
哦 不 我很抱歉听到这个消息
Oh, no. I am so sorry to hear that.

309
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:12,945
谢谢你 索克斯
Thank you, Sox.

310
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,404
不客气 巴斯
You're welcome, Buzz.

311
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:15,989
我们玩游戏好吗？
Shall we play a game?

312
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:17,400
-不 谢谢你 -你确定吗？
-No, thank you. -Are you sure?

313
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,953
我可以根据你的性格特征 专门为你定制一个游戏
I can create a game specifically for you, based on your exact personality profile.

314
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,580
嘿 听着 索克斯 伙计 我很累了
Hey, listen, Sox, buddy, I'm pretty tired.

315
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:26,250
所以 我要去睡觉了
So, I'm gonna go ahead and hit the rack.

316
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,960
当然了
Of course.

317
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,965
如果你愿意 我可以提供助眠音
I can provide sleep sounds if you like.

318
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,633
有几个选项
I have several options.

319
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,261
夏天的夜晚 海洋的天堂 鲸鱼的叫声
Summer night, ocean paradise, whale calls.

320
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:39,263
不 不 白噪音就可以了
No, no. White noise is fine.

321
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:40,430
很好
Very well.

322
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,140
-晚安 索克斯 -晚安 巴斯
-Good night, Sox. -Good night, Buzz.

323
00:19:48,268 --> 00:19:51,650
拉起来
Pull up.

324
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,485
光年船长 你需要帮助吗？
Captain Lightyear, do you need help?

325
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:54,653
不 我可以的
No. I can do it.

326
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,821
巴斯 你确定吗？
Buzz, are you sure?

327
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:57,322
恐怕这是规定
I'm afraid it's protocol.

328
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:58,699
我可以的！
I can do it!

329
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:01,743
我能做到的
I can do it.

330
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,996
传感器显示你做了个噩梦
Sensors indicate you had a nightmare.

331
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:06,623
-你想谈谈它吗？-不愿意
-Would you like to talk about it? -Negative.

332
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:09,376
好吧 但记住 我的任务是帮你
Okay, but remember, my mission is to help you.

333
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,044
而且我不会放弃我的任务
And I'm not giving up on my mission.

334
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,379
是吗？
Yeah?

335
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:14,256
是的
Yeah.

336
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:17,342
你知道吗 索克斯 我也不会放弃我的任务
You know what, Sox, I'm not giving up on my mission either.

337
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,678
太好了!那我能做什么?
Great! So what can I do?

338
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:23,265
好吧 你为什么不和你的老鼠伙伴去玩
Well, why won't you engage with your mouse buddy.

339
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,894
还有什么更有挑战的吗？
Is there anything more challenging?

340
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,437
你想要挑战？好吧
You want a challenge? Okay.

341
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:31,106
我想你可以研究一下这个燃料稳定性的问题
I guess you could work on this fuel stability thing.

342
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:34,610
晶体融合 当然可以
Crystalic fusion. Of course.

343
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,111
你什么时候回来？
When should I expect you back?

344
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:38,113
大约4年后
About four years.

345
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,825
等一下 你没必要这么做
Hold on. You don't have to do this.

346
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:43,619
指挥官 这是我的错误
Commander, this is my mistake.

347
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,078
我需要把它纠正过来
I need to make it right.

348
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,456
好吧 但也许我们应该考虑一下
Okay, but maybe we should think about this.

349
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:50,292
考虑什么？拜托 我们是太空游侠
Think about what? Come on, we're Space Rangers.

350
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,044
我们就是要完成任务
We finish the mission.

351
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:55,589
好吧 能再次穿上这身制服很好
Well, it would be nice to wear the suit again.

352
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:58,258
人们开始忘记太空游侠的重要性
People are starting to forget Space Rangers ever mattered.

353
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,677
好吧 我正是要解决这个问题
Well, I'm about to fix that.

354
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,137
飞向宇宙
To infinity.

355
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:03,764
浩瀚无垠
And beyond.

356
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:11,772
不稳定
UNSTABLE

357
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:21,884
40周年快乐
HAPPY 40TH ANNIVERSARY

358
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:27,931
不稳定
UNSTABLE

359
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,709
嗨 巴斯
Hi, Buzz.

360
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,005
你会在一两年内回到这里...
You're back here in a year or two...

361
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:03,967
但是 我不会了
and, well, I won't.

362
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,386
我不知道什么时候发生的
I don't know when it happened

363
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:10,516
但我似乎已经变得很老了
but I seem to have gone and gotten very old.

364
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:15,187
我一直以为我们会再次成为太空游侠
I always thought we'd get to be Space Rangers again.

365
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:19,274
我怀念在穿梭在星空中的日子
I miss being out among the stars.

366
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,360
所有的冒险
All the adventures.

367
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:26,031
但相比这些 我更想念的是
But more than any of that

368
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:28,242
我想念你
I missed you.

369
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:31,787
嗨 奶奶
Hi, Grandma.

370
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:34,581
嘿 亲爱的
Hey, sweetheart.

371
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:37,459
我给我的朋友巴斯留个口信
I'm leaving a message for my friend, Buzz.

372
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:38,627
是太空游侠?
The Space Ranger?

373
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:40,712
是啊
That's right.

374
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:42,631
他现在还在太空中
He's in space right now.

375
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:43,799
哇
Wow.

376
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:46,093
这是我的孙女 依奇
This is my granddaughter, Izzy.

377
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,220
我也要成为一名太空游侠
I'm gonna be a Space Ranger too.

378
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:49,388
就像他一样?
Just like him?

379
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:50,931
就像你一样
Just like you.

380
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:56,687
再见 巴斯
Goodbye, Buzz.

381
00:23:57,229 --> 00:24:01,233
很抱歉无法看着你完成任务了
I'm sorry I won't be there to see you finish the mission.

382
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:05,571
飞向宇宙
To infinity.

383
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,449
浩瀚无垠
And beyond.

384
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:47,237
咚咚 对不起 打扰了 我刚刚搬进我的新...
Knock. Knock. Sorry to interrupt. I'm just moving into my new-

385
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,743
看那！巴斯光年本人亲临了
Look at that! The actual Buzz Lightyear in the flesh.

386
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:53,911
是啊
Affirmative.

387
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,548
指挥官卡尔·伯恩赛德
Commander Cal Burnside.

388
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,414
我小的时候可是你的忠实粉丝
I was a big fan of your when I was a kid.

389
00:24:57,581 --> 00:25:01,585
好吧 期待着与的你合作 最终能带我们离开这里
Well, then I look forward to working with you to finally get us out of here.

390
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:04,379
没有人告诉你吗？
Did no one tell you?

391
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:05,756
告诉我什么？
Tell me what?

392
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:07,174
好吧
Yeah.

393
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,288
那是最后一次任务了 巴斯
That was the last mission, Buzz.

394
00:25:10,386 --> 00:25:11,238
你说什么？
What?

395
00:25:11,322 --> 00:25:13,430
我们决定要继续留在这里
We've decided we gonna go ahead and stay right here.

396
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:15,933
等等 这里？不行 这不是一个可行的选择
Wait, here? Negative, that is not a viable option.

397
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,061
现在它是了 看 我们正在建造这个
It is now. See, we're building this.

398
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:22,105
激光护盾
Laser shield.

399
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,525
它可以把一切都挡在外面
It'll keep all the creeters out.

400
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:27,903
我们就躲在这里 然后用现有的资源应付生活
And we'll just tuck right in here and make do with what we've got.

401
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,864
应付？不 等等 你不明白 指挥官
Make do? No. Wait. But you don't understand, Commander.

402
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:33,492
我可以继续干 得以让我们离开这里
I can still do it. I can get us outta here.

403
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,577
老兄 你还相信这一点 真是太好了
Man, it's great you still believe that.

404
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,995
但我们现在也不错
But we're good, Buzz.

405
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,956
特别是有了激光护盾
Got the laser shield.

406
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:45,754
哦 你好 巴斯
Oh. Hello, Buzz.

407
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:48,590
巴斯？
Buzz?

408
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:55,597
我有个好消息 巴斯
Well, I've got some good news, Buzz.

409
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:58,183
我解决了燃料的问题
I figured out the fuel problem.

410
00:25:58,517 --> 00:25:59,601
什么？
What?

411
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,562
这是一个有意思的组合
It was an interesting combination.

412
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:04,481
仅仅是有很小的差异 但就造成了很大的差别
Just the slightest variance, but that made all the difference.

413

00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:34,593
好吧...
Okay...

555
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:37,596
所以 让我尽快了解这个
So, get me up to speed on this.

556
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:40,182
好的 佐格飞船大约一周前出现的
Right. The Zurg ship showed up about a week ago.

557
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:41,350
佐格是什么?
What's a Zurg?

558
00:35:42,038 --> 00:35:45,312
机器人只会说这个 所以我们就叫它大船
That's the only thing the robots say, so that's what we call the big ship.

559
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:49,525
佐格飞船来后 机器人包围了基地 然后... ...
The Zurg ship arrived, the robots surrounded the base, and then...

560
00:35:49,691 --> 00:35:53,070
塔卡尼主星的公民们 我们遭到了外星机器人的袭击
Citizens of T'kani Prime, robot aliens have attacked.

561
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:54,821
大家都在里边
Everyone inside the perimeter.

562
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:55,864
小心！
Look out!

563
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:58,116
我们马上启动激光护盾
We are activating the laser shield immediately.

564
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:01,620
这就是我们最后得到的消息
And that's the last we heard.

565
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:06,750
所有这些人 他们都指望着我
All these people, they were counting on me.

566
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,628
而现在他们被困住了
And now they're trapped.

567
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:13,757
我们试图联系他们 但没有通信 不管是向内还是向外
We've tried to reach them, but there's no communication, in or out.

568
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:14,925
索克斯？
Sox?

569
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:16,844
喵喵 她说对了
Meow meow. She's correct.

570
00:36:17,629 --> 00:36:19,464
你的猫还能验证我说的话?
Did you check me against your cat?

571
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:21,473
他不是你印象中的猫
Well, he's not your standard-issue feline.

572
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,642
事实上 索克斯是你奶奶送的礼物
Actually, Sox was a gift from your grandmother.

573
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:25,936
-你好 依奇 -你好 索克斯
-Hello, Izzy. -Hello, Sox.

574
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:29,690
嘿 那是什么声音? 小心点 别把猫弄坏了
Hey, what's that noise? Come on, don't break my cat.

575
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:31,608
他在咕噜咕噜 他就喜欢这样
He's purring. He likes it.

576
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:32,776
索克斯 你喜欢吗？
Sox, do you like it?

577
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:33,944
喜欢
I do.

578
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:38,031
好吧 我希望你已经准备参与行动了 因为我们需要一个飞行员
Well, I hope you're ready for action. Because all we needed was a pilot.

579
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:39,199
做什么？
For what?

580
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:41,410
我有一个计划并且我还有一个团队
I have a plan and I have a team.

581
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:45,664
来吧！
Come on!

582
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:13,692
伙计们 集合了
All right, team, fall in.

583
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:20,574
我找到了个飞行员 惊喜派对行动要开始了
I found a pilot. Operation Surprise Party is a go.

584
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:26,663
我喜欢 一个精英小队 精英中的精英
I like this. An elite squad. The best of the best.

585
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,584
你们知道吗 她奶奶是历史上最伟大的太空游侠
You know, her grandmother was the greatest Space Ranger in the history of the Corps.

586
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:32,044
能和你一起共事将是一种荣誉
It will be an honor to work with you.

587
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:33,837
来吧 到这边来 伙计们
Come on, gather round, team.

588
00:37:36,757 --> 00:37:37,966
让我们回顾一下我们的目标
Let's review our objectives.

589
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:39,134
干掉那些机器人
Kill the robots.

590
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:40,302
还有不要死
And don't die.

591
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:43,597
"不要死 "是你每天都要做做到的
"Don't die" is just something you wanna do every day.

592
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:44,765
这仍然是一个目标
It's still an objective.

593
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:46,767
如果可以的话 我们有还有一个目标
If I may, we have one objective.

594
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:49,853
我们需要把这个晶体装进萝卜号里 然后离开这里
We need to put this crystal in the turnip and get outta here.

595
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,606
所以 要做到这一点 我们必须进入基地
So, to do that we have to get onto the base.

596
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:55,108
要做到这一点 我们必须杀死所有的机器人
To do that we have to kill all the robots.

597
00:37:55,275 --> 00:37:57,611
要做到这一点 我们必须摧毁佐格飞船
To do that we have to destroy the Zurg ship.

598
00:37:57,778 --> 00:38:00,572
而要做到这些 我们就必须不死
And to do any of that we have to not die.

599
00:38:02,465 --> 00:38:03,324
DERIC
DERIC

600
00:38:03,408 --> 00:38:05,661
让我解释一下什么是惊喜派对行动
Allow me to explain Operation Surprise Party.

601
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:08,580
它是雷霆之矛行动的一个变种
It is a variation on Operation Thunder Spear.

602
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:09,998
你不是还因为那次行动得到了一枚奖章吗？
Didn't you get a medal for that one?

603
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:11,792
实际上是两枚 但是...
Two, actually, but...

604
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,169
等等 你是怎么知道雷霆之矛行动的？
Wait, how do you know about Operation Thunder Spear?

605
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:16,922
我读过我奶奶所有的太空游侠的书 从头读到尾
I've read all my grandma's Space Ranger books, from cover to cover.

606
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:18,131
而且是两遍
Twice.

607
00:38:19,835 --> 00:38:21,419
对不起 机器人猫咪
Excuse me, robot kitty.

608
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:22,594
哦 对不起
Oh, sorry.

609
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:27,182
感应器显示佐格飞船为地面上的机器人提供动力
Sensors have indicated that the Zurg ship powers the robots on the ground.

610
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:31,436
所以 我们飞到那里 炸毁那艘船 给机器人一个大大的惊喜！
So, we fly up there, we blow up the ship. And surprise, robots!

611
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:32,729
你们要变烤面包了
You're toast.

612
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:34,940
然后 我们把你的晶体装进萝卜号里
Then, we put your crystal in the turnip.

613
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:36,525
然后任务就完成了
And finish the mission.

614
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:39,820
这是个好计划 飞向宇宙
It's a good plan. To infinity.

615
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:42,698
你想让我碰你的手指吗？
Are you trying to get me to pull your finger?

616
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:43,866
别上当了
Don't fall for it.

617
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:45,492
不 不是这样的 是...
No, not like that, it was...

618
00:38:46,243 --> 00:38:48,370
对不起 这是你奶奶和我过去常干的
Sorry, it's a thing your grandma and I used to do.

619
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:49,538
恶心
Ew.

620
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:51,790
我... 我们从来没有... 她不是...
I-- We were never-- She didn't mean to...

621
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:53,166
总之 算了吧 我们继续
Anyway, forget it. Moving on.

622
00:38:54,543 --> 00:38:56,391
我们把这些弹药装到犰狳号上
Let's load these munitions into the Armadillo

623
00:38:56,475 --> 00:38:57,796
并准备好战斗
and steel ourselves for combat.

624
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,591
惊喜派对行动开始了
Operation Surprise Party is on.

625
00:39:01,717 --> 00:39:03,218
巴斯 你听到什么吗？
Buzz, do you hear that?

626
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:04,636
我听到有什么动静
I hear something.

627
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:08,599
你觉得是机器人吗？
You think it's a robot?

628
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:11,101
不 我们从来没有在离基地这么远的地方见过机器人
Nah, we've never seen a robot this far from the base.

629
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:12,269
我怎么什么都没听到
I don't hear anything.

630
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:14,146
现在听到了
Now I do.

631
00:39:17,437 --> 00:39:18,577
佐格.
Zurg.

632
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:24,198
别担心 我们会救你
Don't worry, we got you.

633
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,994
怎么？
What?

634
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:30,454
训练用弹药
TRAINING AMMO

635
00:39:31,288 --> 00:39:33,540
不要害怕！预备役巡逻队救你回来
Fear not! The Junior Patrol has your back.

636
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:34,708
什么预备役？
The Junior what?

637
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:40,047
不 飞船！
No! The ship!

638
00:39:46,762 --> 00:39:47,596
射中了吗？
Did I get it?

639
00:39:47,763 --> 00:39:48,555
很接近
Pretty close.

640
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:50,140
对不起 我没有受过这种武器的训练
Sorry, I'm not trained with this weapon.

641
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:51,099
我重新装弹
Let me reload.

642
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:53,435
没受过训练？等等 你说你 "没有受过训练 "是什么意思？
Not trained? Wait, what do you mean you're "not trained"?

643
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,199
你在那里 抓住它！抓住它！
You there. Grab it! Grab it!

644
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:09,701
抓住什么？
Grab what?

645
00:40:09,861 --> 00:40:11,530
我不能触碰武器
I'm not allowed to handle weapons

646
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:13,539
这违反我的假释规定
the violation of my parole.

647
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:14,498
假释？
Parole?

648
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:15,249
巴斯！
Buzz!

649
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:16,166
依奇！就现在！
Izzy! Now!

650
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:21,547
不！
No!

651
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:22,965
好吧 我有个新计划
Okay, new plan.

652
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:24,925
新计划？旧计划是什么？
New plan? What was the old plan?

653
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:26,677
我需要... 有人看到鱼叉了吗？
I need the-- Anyone seen the harpoons?

654
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,185
他们准备了一个鱼叉 但我找不到... ...
They came preloaded with a harpoon, but I can't find--

655
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:36,478
哦 我找到了
Oh, I found it.

656
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:39,356
我找到了鱼叉 我现在要重新装上它 看看这个吧
I found the harpoons. I'm gonna reload it now. Check this out.

657
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,033
射中了吗？
Did I get it?

658
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:50,993
再往左一点点
A little to the left.

659
00:41:16,935 --> 00:41:17,936
什么？
What?

660
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:22,399
射中了吗？
Did I get it?

661
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:23,650
射中了
You got it.

662
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:24,860
是的！
Yes!

663
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:28,780
轰隆隆
Boom.

664
00:41:57,184 --> 00:42:00,562
好吧 好吧 到底是什么... ... 这一切...
Okay, okay. What exactly-- How did that--

665
00:42:00,729 --> 00:42:01,730
你们到底是谁？
Who are you?

666
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:04,066
我们是预备役巡逻队 为你服务
We're the Junior Patrol, at your service.

667
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:06,610
我需要了解更多情况
Right, I'm gonna need more information.

668
00:42:06,777 --> 00:42:09,655
我们是一支由上进的学员组成的志愿者队伍
We are a volunteer team of self-motivated cadets.

669
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:12,699
我们每个月在前哨站这里训练一个星期
We train one week in a month here at the outpost.

670
00:42:12,852 --> 00:42:14,973
莫 达比和我是上周末机器人出现时
Mo and Darby and I were the first to arrive last weekend

671
00:42:15,071 --> 00:42:16,328
首批抵达的
when the robots showed up.

672
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:19,289
所以 我们策划了惊喜派对行动
So, we cooked up Operation Surprise Party.

673
00:42:19,456 --> 00:42:20,874
那么说 你们都是菜鸟咯？
So, you are rookies?

674
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:24,461
老兄 我们倒是想成为菜鸟呢 但现在我们连菜鸟都不够格
Boy, we'd love to be rookies, still building up to that.

675
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:26,922
好的 你们有弹药训练吗？
Okay. Do you have munitions training?

676
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:28,340
-只有一部分 -你们做过战术训练吗？
-Partial. -Tactical engagement?

677
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:29,716
-还没有 -有战斗经验呢？
-Pending. -Combat experience?

678
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:33,053
是的！如果我们刚刚跟机器人的那次算数的话
Yes! If you count the robot situation we just went through.

679
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,888
好的 来吧 索克斯
Okay. Come on, Sox.

680
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:36,139
你这是干什么？
What are you doing?

681
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:37,793
听着 你们看来是好人
Look, you seem nice people.

682
00:42:37,877 --> 00:42:40,518
我非常支持你们的训练计划
I'm very supportive of your training initiatives.

683
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:42,563
但我还是得从今往后独自行动
But I'm gonna go ahead and take it from here.

684
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:44,481
可我们刚刚从机器人手里救了你
We just saved you from that robot.

685
00:42:44,648 --> 00:42:46,608
-怎么说？-莫完成了致命一击
-Excuse me? -Mo made the kill shot.

686
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,068
莫的确很幸运
Mo got lucky.

687
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:49,236
非常幸运
Very.

688
00:42:49,945 --> 00:42:52,698
那么 如果们能告诉我另外一艘飞船在哪
So, if you could just point me in the direction of another ship.

689
00:42:52,865 --> 00:42:56,243
在废弃仓库里有可用的飞船
There are operational spacecrafts at the abandoned storage depot.

690
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,619
很好 那是哪儿？
Great. Where is that?

691
00:42:57,786 --> 00:43:01,206
仓库就在资源重组中心旁边
The storage depot is directly adjacent to the Resource Reconstituting Center,

692
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:04,751
距你现在的位置有4.2公里
which is 4.2 kilometers from your current location.

693
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:06,253
棒极了 那又是哪儿？
Great. Where is that?

694
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,796
很简单
It's actually quite simple.

695
00:43:07,963 --> 00:43:09,298
好吧
Okay.

696
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:12,885
首先向南朝着基地前进
You will first head south towards the base.

697
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:15,012
经过两个红绿灯后 然后...
After two stop lights you will--

698
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:18,515
等一下 不对 那是死路
Wait, that is not right. That is a dead end.

699
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:21,018
哦 我明白了 我走错了
Oh, I see, I was in the wrong spot.

700
00:43:21,185 --> 00:43:23,395
对不起 我重来

首先向南朝着基地前进
You will first head south towards the base.

702
00:43:26,081 --> 00:43:30,110
过了两个红绿灯后 稍往左转 然后... ...
After two stop lights you'll take a gentle left and--

703
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:32,362
哎呀 我又错了
Shoot. I have made another error.

704
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:33,530
我们带你去吧
We'll just show you.

705
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:34,720
请允许再说一次
Allow me to restart.

706
00:43:34,807 --> 00:43:37,158
首先向南朝着基地前进
You will first head south towards the base.

707
00:43:37,242 --> 00:43:41,079
过了两个红绿灯后 向右转...
After two stop lights you'll take a hard right...

708
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:43,165
巴斯光年任务补充日志

在最终实现光速飞行后
Having finally achieved hyper-speed

710
00:43:44,975 --> 00:43:47,544
却又多了一个障碍
I now have an additional obstacle in my way.

711
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:52,591
为了逃离这个星球 我必须独自摧毁一艘巨大的外星飞船
In order to flee this planet I'll have to destroy a massive alien ship alone.

712
00:43:52,758 --> 00:43:54,384
没有任何形式的协助
with no assistance of any kind.

713
00:43:54,551 --> 00:43:57,012
你知道的 我们能帮忙 这是我们的计划
You know, we can help you. It is our plan.

714
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:58,180
我不允许这样
I can't allow that.

715
00:43:58,347 --> 00:44:00,057
星际命令代号2709.3

717

好吧 但我可是霍桑家的
Okay, but I'm a Hawthorne.

718
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:06,688
这可不只是个家族名 依奇
It's more than just a name, Izzy.

719
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:07,731
你必须清楚地知道...
You have to know exactly--

720
00:44:07,898 --> 00:44:10,160
-在面对任何情况下的反应... ...你接下来会说什么
-...how to react in any sit-- -...what you gonna say next.

721
00:44:10,244 --> 00:44:11,254
我想我能做到
I thought I had that one.

722
00:44:11,338 --> 00:44:12,110
好的
Okay.

723
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:15,155
那么你 现在是在参与某种行为矫正?

假释计划

725
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,451
我参与这个 他们给我减刑
I do this and they shave a little time off my sentence.

726
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:21,411
但我在那里真的学到了很多东西
But I really learned a lot in there.

727
00:44:21,578 --> 00:44:23,580
达比可以把任何三样东西混在一起让它们爆炸
Darby can take any three things and make them explode.

728
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:25,958
好的 那你呢？ - 我？
Okay. And what about you?

729
00:44:26,124 --> 00:44:29,753
我以为就是一个好玩的训练营
Me? I thought this was gonna be like a fun boot camp workout thing.

730
00:44:29,913 --> 00:44:31,248
但并不是
But it is not.

731
00:44:31,414 --> 00:44:33,834
所以 我实际上是来这里是纯付出...
So, I was actually coming out here to turn in my stuff--

732
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:35,092
他是个逃兵
He's a quitter.

733
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,385
我不是逃兵
I'm not a quitter.

734
00:44:36,552 --> 00:44:37,427
你就是逃兵
You were quitting.

735
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:39,805
你说什么呢？我只是往另一个方向前进而已
What are you talking about? I was just going in a different direction.

736
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:41,515
是啊 逃兵的方向
Yeah, the direction of a quitter.

737
00:44:41,682 --> 00:44:42,850
好吧 我不说了
You know what, I give up.

738
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:45,018
-你们看见了吧 往右拐...
-See? -On your right..

739
00:44:58,304 --> 00:44:59,199
佐格
Zurg.

740
00:44:59,283 --> 00:45:00,617
现在 我到哪儿了？
Now, where was I?

741
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:02,411
哦在这 我得往回走
Here we are. Let me back up.

742
00:45:04,204 --> 00:45:07,082
继续进行技能训练 这是让你们变强的唯一方法
Hey, keep working on your skills. It's the only way to get better.

743
00:45:07,249 --> 00:45:08,250
我们能帮你
We can help you.

744
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:10,919
很感激 只要你们回到训练场去
And I appreciate that. Just go back to your training facility.

745
00:45:11,086 --> 00:45:12,880
保持警惕 保证安全
Stay alert. Stay safe.

746
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:15,060
我去征用这P-32犰狳号
I'm going to commandeer this P-32 Armadillo

747
00:45:15,144 --> 00:45:16,633
然后去炸掉佐格的船
and go blow up the Zurg ship.

748
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:18,302
那么 这是在告别？
So, this is just goodbye?

749
00:45:18,594 --> 00:45:19,970
是啊 再见吧
Affirmative. Goodbye.

750
00:45:22,347 --> 00:45:24,224
对不起 忘了我的猫
Sorry, I forgot my cat.

751
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:36,153
检测到生命体
Life forms detected.

752
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:37,362
是什么？
What are they?

753
00:45:37,522 --> 00:45:39,149
巨大的昆虫
Giant insectoid organisms.

754
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:41,825
这座建筑似乎是某种巢穴
The building appears to be some sort of hive.

755
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:42,910
有威胁吗？
Are they a threat?

756
00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:44,745
传感器显示它们正在冬眠
Sensors indicate they are hibernating.

757
00:45:44,912 --> 00:45:45,913
非常好
Very good.

758
00:45:46,496 --> 00:45:47,748
哦 看！
Oh, look!

759
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:49,458
是XL-01
It's the XL-01.

760
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,293
已经很久没有...
It's been a long time since...

761
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:52,711
哇哦
Whoa.

762
00:45:52,794 --> 00:45:53,795
那是什么？
What is it?

763
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:55,380
来 我带你看看
Come on, I'll show you.

764
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:11,855
终于
Finally.

765
00:46:15,651 --> 00:46:16,652
对不起 打断一下
Sorry to interrupt.

766
00:46:16,818 --> 00:46:18,362
看起来你正在享受美好的时刻
Looks like you were having a real nice moment.

767
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:19,905
你在这儿干什么？这儿不安全
What are you doing here? It's not safe.

768
00:46:20,113 --> 00:46:21,406
你带走了我们的车钥匙
You took the keys to our truck.

769
00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:22,574
在这儿呢
There they are.

770
00:46:27,913 --> 00:46:29,164
拜托 拜托 拜托
Come on. Come on.

771
00:46:29,331 --> 00:46:30,415
-安静 -我倒是想呢
-Quiet. -I'm trying.

772
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:33,502
搞定了
Got it.

773
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:38,006
-谁去... ... -关门！
-Somebody get-- -Get the door!

774
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:41,718
你想说"关门" 而我已经关门了
You were gonna say "get the door", and I got the door.

775
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:46,515
好吧 我就直说了吧 真希望这事没发生
Well, I'm gonna be blunt here. I wish that hadn't happened.

776
00:46:46,682 --> 00:46:47,975
我们也一样
So did the rest of us.

777
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:49,142
大家拿上武器
Everyone grab a weapon.

778
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:51,353
孩子 我也想 但我的假释...
Boy, I'd love to, but my parole--

779
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,856
作为一名星际指挥官 我授予你紧急权力
As a Star Command Officer I grant you emergency authority.

780
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:55,524
我们要冲出这里
We're gonna blast our way outta here.

781
00:46:55,691 --> 00:46:56,608
现在我们只是在喋喋不休
Now we're talking!

782
00:46:56,775 --> 00:47:00,404
巴斯 正面攻击的生存概率是38. 2%
Buzz, the probability of survival a frontal attack is 38.2 percent.

783
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:01,738
似乎有点低
Seems a bit low.

784
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:03,031
那隐身模式呢？
What about Stealth Mode?

785
00:47:03,198 --> 00:47:04,366
你怎么知道隐身模式的？
How do you know about Stealth Mode?

786
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:06,535
奶奶和我以前总是在玩隐身模式
Grandma and I used to play Stealth Mode all the time.

787
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:08,304
这就像捉迷藏 但有点作弊嫌疑
It was like hide-and-seek, but with a twist.

788
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:11,999
好的 其实这是不错的想法 我使用隐身模式来迷惑他们
Okay, well, it's actually good thinking. I'll use Stealth Mode to disorient them.

789
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:14,084
或者 用我的办法
Or, and stick with me here.

790
00:47:14,237 --> 00:47:17,282
我们都使用隐身模式 然后直接走出去
We could all use Stealth Mode and just walk right out.

791
00:47:19,006 --> 00:47:20,883
你是说 你要穿太空游侠的制服？
You mean, you would wear a Space Ranger suit?

792
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:22,885
这制服上已经有我的名字了
This one already has my name on it.

793
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:26,722
好吧
Okay.

794
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:28,515
让我们捋一下
Let's review.

795
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:29,558
我去...
I'm going--

796
00:47:29,725 --> 00:47:30,726
那边儿
That way.

797
00:47:30,893 --> 00:47:31,768
而你们要去...
And you're going--

798
00:47:31,935 --> 00:47:33,020
那边儿
That way.

799
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:34,188
好的 非常好
Okay. Very good.

800
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:36,982
看呐 我是费瑟... 费瑟林... ...
Check it out, I'm Feathers... Feathering...

801
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:39,818
哦 看 是支笔 真酷
Oh, look, a pen. Cool.

802
00:47:39,985 --> 00:47:42,029
-你的有笔吗？-好了 注意了
-Does yours have a pen? -Okay, pay attention.

803
00:47:42,196 --> 00:47:43,405
隐身模式是相当简单的
Stealth mode is fairly simple.

804
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:45,657
只有两个要点 按下这个按钮--
There are just two parts. You press the button--

805
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:47,993
-是这个按钮吗？-我会告诉你哪个按钮
-Is it this button? -I will tell you which button.

806
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,244
-那这个按钮呢？-我很抱歉
-What about this button? -I'm sorry.

807
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:51,205
我们没有时间去了解所有的按钮了
We're not gonna have time to go over all the buttons.

808
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:52,831
好吧 忘掉按钮 那这个东西呢？
Okay, forget the button. What about this thing?

809
00:47:52,998 --> 00:47:53,832
-它更-- -不！不！ 不！
-It's more-- -No! No!

810
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:56,126
那是投降拉环 你千万别拉那个
That's the surrender strand. You never pull that.

811
00:47:56,293 --> 00:47:58,629
对于太空游侠来说 没有比这更可耻的举动了
There is no more shameful maneuver for a Space Ranger.

812
00:47:58,795 --> 00:47:59,796
打扰一下
Excuse me.

813
00:47:59,963 --> 00:48:02,174
我还是没搞清哪个是隐身模式的按钮？
Did I miss which button is the Stealth Mode button?

814
00:48:02,341 --> 00:48:03,425
是这个
It's this button.

815
00:48:03,592 --> 00:48:04,635
现在别按!
Not yet!

816
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:07,554
按下这个按钮 然后就从前门走出去
You push this button, then you go out the front door,

817
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:09,515
然后我就去炸掉佐格飞船
and I'll go blow up the Zurg ship.

818
00:48:09,681 --> 00:48:11,099
-准备好了吗？-准备好了
-Ready? -Ready.

819
00:48:11,308 --> 00:48:13,101
不 等等 还没准备好 等一下
No, wait. Not ready. Hang on.

820
00:48:13,268 --> 00:48:15,187
好了 拿上了 要不就尴尬了
Okay, got 'em. That would've been embarrassing.

821
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:17,731
好
Okay.

822
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:18,982
再见了
Goodbye again.

823
00:48:25,279 --> 00:48:27,281
索克斯 你挡住了我的视线
Sox, you're inhibiting my visual.

824
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:28,784
对不起 这样好点儿吗？
Sorry. Is this better?

825
00:48:28,951 --> 00:48:30,786
-不好 -好吧 这样如何？
-Negative. -Okay, how about this?

826
00:48:31,537 --> 00:48:32,746
不如这样？
How about this?

827
00:48:44,758 --> 00:48:46,552
好 我们到了
Okay. Here we go.

828
00:48:53,642 --> 00:48:56,186
非常好 隐形模式工作得很好
Very good. Stealth Mode working as planned.

829
00:48:57,623 --> 00:49:01,067
这真是酷 这些傻虫子看不见我们
This is pretty cool. These dumb bugs can't even see us.

830
00:49:01,322 --> 00:49:03,157
嘿 虫子 嘿 虫子 傻虫子
Hey, bug. Hey, bug. Bug.

831
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,820
我在这儿 傻虫子 你看不见我吧？
I'm right here, bug. Can't you see me?

832
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:08,949
看不见 他根本就看不见我
He can't. He can't see me at all.

833
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:11,368
时间到了
And time has elapsed.

834
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:13,662
等等 定时器
Wait, the timer.

835
00:49:13,871 --> 00:49:15,247
他们不知道有定时器
They don't know about the timer.

836
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:18,625
你看不见我
You don't see me.

837
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:20,043
等等 我看见你了
Wait. I can see you.

838
00:49:20,794 --> 00:49:21,962
我也看见你了
I can see you too.

839
00:49:22,588 --> 00:49:23,922
虫子看见我们了
The bugs can see us.

840
00:49:24,464 --> 00:49:26,091
不 不 我投降
No, no. I surrender.

841
00:49:28,066 --> 00:49:29,206
推!
Pull!

842
00:49:33,974 --> 00:49:35,517
后退！后退！
Back! Back!

843
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:39,021
这不行
This isn't working.

844
00:49:39,188 --> 00:49:40,564
你们得往前走！
You have to keep going!

845
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,609
我们得调头
We have to turn around.

846
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:46,695
他们冲我们过来了
They're headed right for us.

847
00:49:46,862 --> 00:49:49,072
别 别 别靠近飞船！
No, no. Do not approach the vehicle!

848
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:04,213
很好！
All right!

849
00:50:04,379 --> 00:50:05,839
-良好的团队合作 -来击个掌
-Way to adapt, team. -Give it up here.

850
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:07,925
你们在庆祝什么？
Why are you congratulating yourselves?

851
00:50:08,077 --> 00:50:10,209
因为我刚刚用霍桑家的方式救了大家
Because I just Hawthorned us out right outta that situation.

852
00:50:10,293 --> 00:50:11,730
但你本可以做得...
But you could've made it if--

853
00:50:11,831 --> 00:50:13,346
如果你告诉我们隐身模式会失效
If you had told us the Stealth Mode wears off.

854
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:14,139
好吧...
Well...

855
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:18,268
好了 大家系好安全带
Okay, everyone just strap in.

856
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:22,773
你好 我是你的...
Hello, I am your--

857
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:36,203
抓紧了！
Hold on!

858
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:41,959
我们要上太空了？
Are we going to space?

859
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:43,585
不 我会把你们放在某个地方
No, I'm gonna drop you somewhere.

860
00:50:47,256 --> 00:50:49,383
转得太厉害了 我想要个呕吐袋
That was a big swirly turn. I think I need a bag.

861
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,134
不 不 不要在飞船里吐
No, no. Do not vomit inside the vehicle.

862
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:53,470
我可以看到星星了 这是太空
I can see stars. That is space.

863
00:50:53,637 --> 00:50:54,721
这是怎么了？
What is happening right now?

864
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:55,931
她害怕太空
She's afraid of space.

865
00:50:56,098 --> 00:50:57,391
-什么？ -她有道理 是太可怕了
-What? -She should be. It's horrible

866
00:50:57,558 --> 00:50:59,518
依奇 记住你曾经的训练
Izzy, remember your exercises.

867
00:50:59,685 --> 00:51:00,936
-我要吐了 -不 不
-It's coming. -No, no.

868
00:51:01,103 --> 00:51:02,062
把你的头盔关上 吐头盔里
Engage your helmet. That will catch it.

869
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:03,772
-巴斯！那有艘飞船！-依奇 我正尝试... ...
-Buzz! Another ship! -Izzy, I'm trying--

870
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:27,671
我什么都看不见了
I can't see anything.

871
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:29,590
哦 不！是行星的暗面
Oh, no! The dark side of the planet.

872
00:51:29,756 --> 00:51:30,966
在那儿！三点钟方向！
Over there! Three o'clock!

873
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:33,385
坚持住 这不太好
Hold on. This isn't gonna be pretty.

874
00:51:44,146 --> 00:51:45,147
大家都还好吗？
Is everyone okay?

875
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:46,148
我想是的
I think so.

876
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,618
索克斯 给我一份损坏报告
Sox, give me a damage report.

877
00:51:57,784 --> 00:51:59,453
请稍等
One moment, please.

878
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:03,040
好 好多了
Okay. This is better.

879
00:52:03,498 --> 00:52:04,625
这算好多了?
Is this better?

880
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:08,504
不 显然整体上还很糟糕 我只我说... 你懂的...
No, obviously this is worse overall, I just meant... You know...

881
00:52:09,338 --> 00:52:10,756
你怎么会害怕太空？
How are you afraid of space?

882
00:52:11,256 --> 00:52:12,341
哦 这很简单
Oh, It's pretty easy.

883
00:52:12,674 --> 00:52:16,178
你知道放任不管的话，就会朝一个方向发展吗
Did you know if you let go out there you just keep going in the same direction

884
00:52:16,345 --> 00:52:18,347
一直发展 只是...
forever, just...

885
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:21,141
好吧 那你打算怎么炸掉佐格飞船？
Well, then how were you going to blow up the Zurg ship?

886
00:52:21,308 --> 00:52:23,101
我本来是做地面支援的
I would've been ground support.

887
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:26,188
我知道 奶奶并不害怕太空
I know, grandma wasn't afraid of space.

888
00:52:26,355 --> 00:52:28,273
不 因为她是一名太空游侠
No, because she was a Space Ranger.

889
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,943
天体恐惧症是会自动被取消资格的
Astrophobia is an automatic disqualification.

890
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:32,402
刚才那是什么东西？
What was that thing?

891
00:52:32,611 --> 00:52:34,112
-我不知道 -它还会回来吗？
-I don't know. -Is it gonna come back?

892
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:35,405
我不知道
I don't know.

893
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:37,908
但它是怎么... ... 好吧 你不知道
But how did it-- Okay, you don't know.

894
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:45,374
我本来已经完成了 终于得到了晶体 本该结束一切的
I was done. I finally had the crystal. This was supposed to be over.

895
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:47,584
但骗谁呢？
But who am I kidding?

896
00:52:48,544 --> 00:52:49,921
我需要的根本不是什么晶体
I don't need a crystal.

897
00:52:50,005 --> 00:52:52,042
我需要一台时间机器来摆脱这场混乱
I need a time machine to get out of this mess.

898
00:52:52,756 --> 00:52:54,007
评估完成
Assessment complete.

899
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:55,175
情况有多糟？
How bad is that?

900
00:52:57,261 --> 00:53:01,306
爆炸被热护盾吸收了 仅仅造成了轻微的电气短路
The blast was absorbed by the heat shield and only caused a minor electrical short.

901
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:02,474
好的
Okay.

902
00:53:02,641 --> 00:53:04,101
那么 为了能继续飞行
So, in order to be flight operational

903
00:53:04,268 --> 00:53:07,646
犰狳号需要一种特殊电容
the Armadillo will require a material of specialized capacitance.

904
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:09,106
哦 听起来像电气有关的东西
Oh, like an electrical thingy.

905
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:10,274
你还懂这个？
How do you know that?

906
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,483
我们学过
We learned this.

907
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:15,904
特殊电容 记得吗？我们上个月做的野外收音机？
Specialized capacitance, remember? We built those field radios last month?

908
00:53:16,071 --> 00:53:17,114
哦 是的 很有意思
Oh, yeah. That was fun.

909
00:53:17,281 --> 00:53:18,407
是的 除了达比搞砸了
Yeah, except Darby messed hers up.

910
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:19,575
我要把你搞砸--
I'm gonna mess you up--

911
00:53:19,741 --> 00:53:21,577
拜托 我正在思考
Please. I'm trying to think here.

912
00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:23,871
我搞砸了 但我又把它修好了
I messed mine up, but then I fixed it up.

913
00:53:24,037 --> 00:53:25,372
但是你弄坏了电脑控制台
But you broke that computer console.

914
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:27,624
我需要那个小... 什么来着？
I needed that little coil for its... What was that?

915
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:28,834
特殊电容
Specialized capacitance.

916
00:53:29,001 --> 00:53:31,295
嘿 说实话 这儿这么大的地方
Hey, honestly, there is a lot of room out here.

917
00:53:31,461 --> 00:53:34,214
如果你们要回忆旧事 可以到那边去
If you guys wanna reminisce you could go over there,

918
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:36,550
或者看看 那边儿没人正在思考
or look, there's no one trying to think over there.

919
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:38,635
我们可以到上面去
We can go up there.

920
00:53:38,802 --> 00:53:39,803
好吧 完美
Fine. Perfect.

921
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:42,222
是的 好的 有新计划
Yes. Okay, new plan.

922
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:43,390
等等 什么？
Wait. What?

923
00:53:43,557 --> 00:53:45,601
那个采矿设施会有一个控制台 对吗？
That mining facility will have a console, right?

924
00:53:45,767 --> 00:53:48,145
那个控制台会有一个小线圈 对吗？
That console will have a little coil thing, right?

925
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:49,980
而那个小线圈会有...
And that little coil thing will have the...

926
00:53:50,147 --> 00:53:51,148
特殊电容
Specialized capacitance.

927
00:53:51,315 --> 00:53:53,650
我们需要修复这艘飞船 对吧？
That we need to fix this ship, right?

928
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:54,651
她说得对
She's right.

929
00:53:57,946 --> 00:54:01,116
做得好 这才是霍桑家人的思维方式
Good job. Now that's thinking like a Hawthorne.

930
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,948
我们去拿那个零件 然后离开这里
Let's go get that part and get outta here

931
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,990
在那东西再次找到我们之前
before that thing finds us again.

932
00:54:29,061 --> 00:54:30,312
哇
Whoa.

933
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:32,439
那边
Over there.

934
00:54:35,734 --> 00:54:37,277
好了 我们走吧
Okay, here we go.

935
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:47,204
巴斯光年任务日志
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

936
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:49,998
为了修复飞船 我们必须找到方法
In order to repair our ship we have to find some way

937
00:54:50,165 --> 00:54:52,042
进入指挥中心并...
to get inside the Command Center and...

938
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:56,255
干得好 老犯人
Nice job, elderly convict.

939
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:01,385
好的 线圈应该在这里
Okay, the activation coil should be in here.

940
00:55:01,552 --> 00:55:02,553
索克斯？
Sox?

941
00:55:03,845 --> 00:55:04,846
需要笔吗？
Need a pen?

942
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,640
拿到了
Got it.

943
00:55:07,516 --> 00:55:08,809
好吧 下次吧
Okay, yeah. Another time.

944
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:11,478
哦 不
Oh no.

945
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:13,605
安全措施启动
Security measures activated.

946
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,650
不 别又来一次
No! Not this again.

947
00:55:16,817 --> 00:55:18,026
什么又来？这是什么？
Not what? What is this?

948
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:23,073
捕获锥 在他们来抓你之前 它能限制你行动
A capture cone. That holds you until they come and get you.

949
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,367
没人会来救我们 他们都被困在基地里呢
No one's coming to get us. They're all trapped in the base.

950
00:55:25,534 --> 00:55:26,702
所以 我们应该离开这儿 对吧？
So, we should just leave, right?

951
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:28,287
我们走不了的
We can't just leave.

952
00:55:28,453 --> 00:55:31,415
当然可以 听我说 我们可以离开的
Sure we can. Take it from me, we can always just leave.

953
00:55:32,082 --> 00:55:33,083
看到了吗？
Look, see?

954
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:35,627
不是吧！
Come on!

955
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,921
我都说过了
Told you.

956
00:55:38,422 --> 00:55:41,258
现在 小心点 因为这些东西 --
Now, be careful, because these things--

957
00:55:42,217 --> 00:55:44,011
如果它们互相接触 就会合并在一起
combine if they touch.

958
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:46,722
好吧 对不起 但也许我们两个一起试一下？
All right, sorry. But maybe if we both try it?

959
00:55:46,889 --> 00:55:48,599
那是不行的
That's not gonna work.

960
00:55:48,765 --> 00:55:50,017
你试都没试
You haven't even tried.

961
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:52,394
不！
No!

962
00:55:52,741 --> 00:55:53,574
喵喵
Meow.

963
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:56,148
是的 不行
Yeah, that didn't work.

964
00:55:56,308 --> 00:55:57,642
-巴斯？-哇 别动
-Buzz? -Whoa, hold on.

965
00:55:57,816 --> 00:55:59,943
如果我和你们被困在一起 那就帮不上忙了
I'm no help to anyone if I'm stuck in there with you.

966
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,570
索克斯 你能把这些关掉吗？
Sox, can you turn these off?

967
00:56:02,863 --> 00:56:04,615
我够不到控制装置
I can't reach the controls.

968
00:56:05,324 --> 00:56:07,492
等等 这里的地面软软的
Wait, there's a soft spot in the floor here.

969
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:09,036
-或许我们可以... -那是我的脚
-Maybe if we could-- -That's my foot.

970
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,829
-对不起 -等等 小心！
-Sorry. -Wait, watch it!

971
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:14,708
等等 就是这个 那东西给这东西提供电源
Wait, that's it. That thing powers these things.

972
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:16,960
-那我们就再撞一次 -等等 等一下
-Then let's hit it again. -Wait. Wait.

973
00:56:17,628 --> 00:56:19,129
我们需要开门
We need the door to be open.

974
00:56:19,296 --> 00:56:22,299
我负责开门 你们狠狠地撞那个电源
So I'll open this. You slam into the power source.

975
00:56:22,466 --> 00:56:24,885
这东西会消失 那么我们就可以出去了
These things will disappear. And we'll walk right out.

976
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:25,886
-是的 先生 -好的
-Yes, sir. -All right.

977
00:56:26,053 --> 00:56:26,845
准备好了吗？
Ready?

978
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:31,808
继续！
Keep trying!

979
00:56:36,355 --> 00:56:37,814
我们还不够重
We're just not heavy enough.

980
00:56:38,524 --> 00:56:40,275
巴斯 我们需要你
Buzz, we need you.

981
00:56:40,442 --> 00:56:41,735
等等 到那里边去？
Wait, in there?

982
00:56:41,902 --> 00:56:44,154
但如果不成功 我就不能救你们了
But if it doesn't work I won't be able to save you.

983
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:47,199
你不需要救我们 你需要加入我们
You don't need to save us, you need to join us.

984
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:56,416
再来一次
Again.

985
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,464
再来！
Again!

986
00:57:09,388 --> 00:57:10,472
不！
No!

987
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:12,307
走！快走！
Go! Go!

988
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:14,768
小心！
Watch out!

989
00:57:19,064 --> 00:57:20,065
巴斯 不要！
Buzz, no!

990
00:57:20,232 --> 00:57:21,400
我们需要线圈
We need the coil.

991
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:40,794
我们抓住你了
We got you.

992
00:57:49,845 --> 00:57:50,971
哦 看呐 有零食
Oh, look. Snacks.

993
00:57:53,182 --> 00:57:54,474
有人要吃零食吗？
Anyone going for the snack?

994
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:57,853
肉类三明治
MEAT SANDWICH

995
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:06,612
这里 我们补充点能量吧
Here. Let's all re-charge a little.

996
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:10,949
给
Here you go.

997
00:58:13,476 --> 00:58:17,164
嗯 这是 呃--什么--什么--
Huh, this is, uh-- What-- What's--

998
00:58:17,831 --> 00:58:18,999
这里发生了什么？
What's happening here?

999
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:20,626
你的三文治有什么问题？
Something wrong with your sandwich?

1000
00:58:20,792 --> 00:58:23,378
为什么肉在外面？
Why is the meat on the outside?

1001
00:58:23,712 --> 00:58:25,339
因为它是三明治？
Because it's a sandwich?

1002
00:58:25,506 --> 00:58:27,508
不 面包应该是在外面的
No, the bread is supposed to be on the outside.

1003
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:29,218
什么 面包 肉 面包？
What, like, bread, meat, bread?

1004
00:58:29,384 --> 00:58:30,552
那面包就太多了
That's too much bread.

1005
00:58:31,053 --> 00:58:32,804
是的 但这湿呼呼的
Yes, but this is all wet.

1006
00:58:32,971 --> 00:58:35,015
是的 沾满汁水的手指 那可是精华部分
Yeah. Juicy fingers. That's the best part.

1007
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:36,850
你上次吃三明治是什么时候？
When was the last time you had a sandwich?

1008
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:39,054
我不知道 差不多 一百年前吧
I don't know, a hundred years ago, give or take.

1009
00:58:39,228 --> 00:58:41,188
那只是 "面包 肉 面包"
Just a "bread, meat, bread."

1010
00:58:41,355 --> 00:58:42,356
那面包就太多了
That's too much bread.

1011
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:44,608
会把你嘴里的水分都吸走
That would just suck all the moisture out of your mouth.

1012
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:46,568
说得好 达比
Good one, Darby.

1013
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:47,945
哦 不！
Oh, no!

1014
00:58:48,153 --> 00:58:49,029
索克斯！
Sox!

1015
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,448
醒醒 索克斯
Wake up, Sox.

1016
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:53,575
来吧 小兄弟 醒过来吧
Come on, little buddy, come back to me.

1017
00:58:54,201 --> 00:58:55,661
拜托 索克斯 对不起
Please, Sox. I'm sorry.

1018
00:58:56,495 --> 00:58:57,496
索克斯
Sox.

1019
00:58:59,915 --> 00:59:01,625
你好 我需要重启
Hello. I require a reboot.

1020
00:59:06,797 --> 00:59:10,676
我很抱歉 伙计们 我差点杀了索克斯
I'm sorry, guys. I almost killed Sox.

1021
00:59:10,968 --> 00:59:13,095
我差点把我们都害死了
I almost got us all killed back there.

1022
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:16,515
嘿 听我说 这只是一个小插曲
Hey, listen to me, it was just a mistake.

1023
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,141
对吧 巴斯？
Right, Buzz?

1024
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:24,147
尝试让自己做得更好吧
Just try to get a little better.

1025
00:59:30,624 --> 00:59:31,667
听着
Listen.

1026
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:36,076
我只是...
I just...

1027
00:59:37,035 --> 00:59:42,624
当我第一次去游侠学院的时候 我做得并不... 你知道的... 并不好
When I first went to the Academy I was not... you know... good.

1028
00:59:43,625 --> 00:59:46,170
我每天都搞砸事情
I screwed up every day.

1029
00:59:47,754 --> 00:59:49,131
我在障碍赛中弄得一团糟
I got tangled in the obstacle course.

1030
00:59:49,298 --> 00:59:51,925
我的手抖得厉害 无法打中靶子
My hands shook so much I couldn't hit the target.

1031
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:54,761
都还别说靶心 是无法打中靶子
Not the bulls-eye. The whole target.

1032
00:59:55,512 --> 00:59:57,806
一周后 我就打算退出 因为... ...
And I was gonna quit after the first week, it was...

1033
00:59:57,973 --> 01:00:00,893
我显然不是做太空游侠的料
clear I was not Space Ranger material.

1034
01:00:01,059 --> 01:00:02,102
真吗？
Really?

1035
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:03,562
是的
Yeah.

1036
01:00:04,021 --> 01:00:06,106
但她奶奶在我身上看到了一些东西
But her grandma saw something in me.

1037
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:10,194
所以我也开始寻找它
So I started looking for it too.

1038
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:13,363
重新校准
Recalibrating.

1039
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:17,117
恢复了一个损坏的文件
One corrupted file restored.

1040
01:00:18,911 --> 01:00:20,120
嘿 他亮了
Hey, he's lighting up.

1041
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:23,165
-奶奶 -你好 索克斯
-Grandma. -Hello, Sox.

1042
01:00:23,332 --> 01:00:25,042
我需要你帮我一个忙
I need you to do me a favor.

1043
01:00:25,209 --> 01:00:29,213
我需要你照顾我最好的朋友 他的名字叫巴斯
I need you to look after my best friend. His name is Buzz.

1044
01:00:29,796 --> 01:00:33,342
他现在不在 但他很快就会回来
He's away right now, but he'll be back soon.

1045
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:35,511
他是一名太空游侠
He's a Space Ranger.

1046
01:00:35,677 --> 01:00:38,555
他要把我们都带回家 让我们都回家
He's going to get us all home. Get us all home.

1047
01:00:53,111 --> 01:00:54,363
怎么了？
What's wrong?

1048
01:00:54,905 --> 01:00:56,198
你没听到吗？
Did not you hear that?

1049
01:00:56,573 --> 01:00:58,951
她相信我可以弥补我犯的错误
She believed I could fix the mistake I made.

1050
01:00:59,785 --> 01:01:01,954
而这种信念让她失去了一切
And that belief cost her everything.

1051
01:01:02,829 --> 01:01:04,706
一切？并没有
Everything? No.

1052
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:08,836
她有基科奶奶 有我爸爸和我 还有她所有的朋友
She had grandma Kiko, my Dad and me, all her friends.

1053
01:01:09,795 --> 01:01:13,882
她本不应该在这里 但她在这个星球上得到了完整的人生 巴斯
She didn't meant to be here, but she had a whole life on this planet, Buzz.

1054
01:01:14,716 --> 01:01:15,884
我们所有人都是这样
All of us had.

1055
01:01:17,052 --> 01:01:18,762
除了你
Except for you.

1056
01:01:21,139 --> 01:01:25,394
我们想再次成为太空游侠 我们想变得重要
We wanted to be Space Rangers again. We wanted to matter.

1057
01:01:26,603 --> 01:01:29,439
相信我 她很重要
Believe me, she mattered.

1058
01:01:42,244 --> 01:01:43,829
你知道 这很不错
You know, it is pretty good this way.

1059
01:01:44,413 --> 01:01:48,375
是吗？面包 肉 面包 你这样做了多长时间？
Yeah? Bread, meat, bread. How long did you do it like that?

1060
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:49,918
一直
Forever.

1061
01:01:52,171 --> 01:01:53,547
电已充满
Fully recharged.

1062
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:54,965
来吧
Come on.

1063
01:01:55,132 --> 01:01:57,718
我们去把零件装回飞船 然后离开这里
Let's go put this part in the ship and get outta here.

1064
01:01:58,302 --> 01:01:59,303
索克斯 你能帮我们照路吗?
Sox, can you light our way?

1065
01:01:59,469 --> 01:02:00,470
当然
Of course.

1066
01:02:00,572 --> 01:02:03,312
咔嚓 咔嚓
Click click. Click click.

1067
01:02:03,932 --> 01:02:06,643
我看到你了 我要抓住你 抓住你
I see you. I'm gonna get ya. I'm gonna get ya.

1068
01:02:06,803 --> 01:02:07,596
哦 没抓住
Oh, I didn't get ya.

1069
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:09,438
-索克斯？-去哪了？我抓住了！
-Sox? -Where'd you go? I got you!

1070
01:02:09,605 --> 01:02:10,856
-索克斯 -是的 对不起
-Sox. -Yeah, sorry.

1071
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:17,647
这真是令人兴奋 惊喜派对行动 我们来了！
This is exciting. Operation Surprise Party, here we come!

1072
01:02:17,814 --> 01:02:20,609
等等 说什么？不行 我不能置你们于危险境地
Wait, what? Negative. I can't put you in harm's way like that.

1073
01:02:20,782 --> 01:02:22,492
什么 你要独自去完成任务吗？
What, are you gonna do the whole mission alone?

1074
01:02:22,659 --> 01:02:23,660
我能做到
I can do it.

1075
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:25,495
因为你有一个霍桑家的人 就在这里
Because you got a Hawthorne right here.

1076
01:02:25,662 --> 01:02:29,208
我很感激 告诉你吧 如果我需要你 会让你知道的
And I appreciate that. Tell you what, I'll let you know if I need you.

1077
01:02:29,374 --> 01:02:33,378
但在那之前 我们先设法回到犰狳号 不要再...
But until then let's just try to get back to the Armadillo without any more--

1078
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:41,762
快跑！
Run!

1079
01:02:46,808 --> 01:02:47,518
不！
No!

1080
01:02:52,397 --> 01:02:53,232
什么？
What?

1081
01:02:53,398 --> 01:02:55,150
它在追我！回到飞船上去！
It's after me! Go back to the ship!

1082
01:02:55,317 --> 01:02:56,360
但是巴斯！
But Buzz!

1083
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:00,864
巴斯光年任务日志
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

1084
01:03:03,909 --> 01:03:05,285
我被一个...
I'm being pursued by a...

1085
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,622
一个巨大的机器人追
just a massive robot.

1086
01:03:09,831 --> 01:03:12,793
我正在引开它 让其他人逃到飞船上去
I'm leading it away while the others escape to the ship.

1087
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:36,024
巴斯 -什么？
Buzz.

1088
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:38,235
什么 你怎么知道我的名字？
What? How do you know my name?

1089
01:03:39,611 --> 01:03:40,654
到我这来
Come with me.

1090
01:03:40,821 --> 01:03:41,822
什么？
What?

1091
01:03:45,576 --> 01:03:48,203
这绝对违反了我的假释规定
This is definitely a violation of my parole.

1092
01:03:52,332 --> 01:03:54,334
来吧 我们离开这儿
Come on. Let's get outta here.

1093
01:04:14,556 --> 01:04:15,596
佐格
Zurg.

1094
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:37,753
准备发射 惊喜派对行动又开始了
Ready yourselves for launch. Operation Surprise Party is back on.

1095
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:38,921
什么？我们一起吗？
What? With us?

1096
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:40,589
什么？ 难道让我一个人完成整个任务吗？
What, am I gonna do the whole mission alone?

1097
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:44,301
还不能发射 我需要5分钟来安装线圈
We can't launch yet. I need five minutes to install the coil.

1098
01:04:48,305 --> 01:04:49,973
我们不能在这儿干坐5分钟
We can't sit here for five minutes.

1099
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:51,715
飞船仍有悬停能力
The ship still has hover capabilities.

1100
01:04:51,799 --> 01:04:52,625
那我们就用上它吧
Then let's use them.

1101
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,704
我们能在火焰喷泉那甩掉它们
We might lose them in the fire geysers.

1102
01:05:12,913 --> 01:05:15,415
你带路 你们两个 干掉那些机器人
Point the way. You two, blast some robots.

1103
01:05:15,582 --> 01:05:16,959
但我们还没有完成弹药训练
But we haven't even finished our munitions training.

1104
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:18,836
这能有多难？你瞧
How hard can it be? Look.

1105
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:21,526
我们有这些带刺的东西 这东西会爆炸
We got these spiky things. And these one probably explode.

1106
01:05:21,713 --> 01:05:23,090
只要跟着感觉来就行了
Just do whatever feels right.

1107
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:24,675
什么?你打算怎么干?
What? What are you gonna do?

1108
01:05:24,842 --> 01:05:26,760
我要和 "炸弹先生 "跳个舞
I'm gonna dance with Mister Boom.

1109
01:05:32,766 --> 01:05:35,310

完成百分之二十
Twenty percent complete.

1111

百分之？
Out of a hundred?

1112
01:05:42,317 --> 01:05:44,611
他们还在追 火焰喷泉在哪儿呢？
They're gaining on us. Where are those fire geysers?

1113
01:05:44,778 --> 01:05:45,779
就在前面
Dead ahead.

1114
01:05:45,946 --> 01:05:47,281
别担心 我知道每一寸...
Don't worry, I know every last inch of--

1115
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:48,448
小心！
Watch out!

1116
01:05:59,543 --> 01:06:00,878
这儿 扔这个
Here, throw this.

1117

Izzy, do you know how to transfer power on the fly?

1127
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:53,472
我已经在模拟器上做过了
I've done it in the simulator.

1128
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:55,015
好吧 现在要来真的了
Well, it's about to get real.

1129
01:06:55,724 --> 01:06:58,143
-需要我帮忙吗？-绝对不需要
-Do you need my help with anything? -Absolutely not.

01:07:04,608 --> 01:07:05,651
记住训练中的内容
Remember from training.

1134
01:07:05,817 --> 01:07:07,986
不要用力扣扳机 你要轻扣扳机
You don't pull the trigger, you squeeze the trigger.

1135
01:07:08,153 --> 01:07:09,029

1140
01:07:17,663 --> 01:07:19,540
重新启动 好的 准备好发射
Reboot. Okay, be ready to launch

1141
01:07:19,706 --> 01:07:21,208
当燃料电池...
when the fuel cell is--

1142
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:22,167
不！
No!

1143
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:30,926
哦 不
Oh, no.

1144
01:07:31,134 --> 01:07:31,927
该死的！
Blast!

1145
01:07:37,307 --> 01:07:38,642
去拿晶体!
Grab the crystal!

1146
01:07:57,035 --> 01:07:57,911
不 不
No.

1147
01:08:07,254 --> 01:08:08,255
我...
I...

1148
01:08:18,974 --> 01:08:20,017
巴斯
Buzz.

1149
01:08:20,642 --> 01:08:21,643
对不起
I'm so sorry.

1150
01:08:22,728 --> 01:08:25,314
一切都发生得太快了 我...
Everything was happening so fast and I...

1151
01:08:25,479 --> 01:08:26,607
我只是...
I just...

1152
01:08:29,943 --> 01:08:31,737
我犯了错
I made a mistake.

1153
01:08:33,029 --> 01:08:34,156
是的
Yeah.

1154
01:08:37,033 --> 01:08:39,411
好吧 但我们还没有完蛋 对吗？
Okay, but we're not done, right?

1155
01:08:39,995 --> 01:08:41,622
我们仍然可以做些什么
We can still do something.

1156
01:08:41,787 --> 01:08:44,041
依奇 看看周围
Izzy, look around.

1157
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:46,210
没有什么可做的
There is nothing to do.

1158
01:08:46,376 --> 01:08:47,461
这个任务...
The mission...

1159
01:08:48,754 --> 01:08:49,921
已经结束了
It's over.

1160
01:08:50,671 --> 01:08:51,798
巴斯
Buzz.

1161
01:08:52,256 --> 01:08:53,425
巴斯！
Buzz!

1162
01:08:53,591 --> 01:08:55,051
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

1163
01:08:55,219 --> 01:08:58,388
我只是需要一个人静一静
I just need to be by myself.

1164
01:09:01,308 --> 01:09:02,309
不！
No!

1165
01:09:08,564 --> 01:09:09,566
巴斯！
Buzz!

1166
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:13,569
巴斯！
Buzz.

1167
01:09:46,645 --> 01:09:47,645
什么鬼...
What the...

1168
01:09:47,979 --> 01:09:50,439
这是什么？我们在哪里？
What is this? Where are we?

1169
01:09:51,483 --> 01:09:52,609
你是谁？
Who are you?

1170
01:09:52,901 --> 01:09:54,695
这就是问题所在
Now that's the question.

1171
01:10:05,247 --> 01:10:07,082
你看起来不错 巴斯
You look good, Buzz.

1172
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:09,334
爸爸？
Dad?

1173
01:10:09,585 --> 01:10:10,586
再猜猜
Guess again.

1174
01:10:25,475 --> 01:10:26,476
索克斯？
Sox?

1175
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:29,313
你好 巴斯
Hello, Buzz.

1176
01:10:30,189 --> 01:10:31,648
我不明白
I don't understand.

1177
01:10:37,863 --> 01:10:39,156
我把这一切都搞砸了
I messed this all up.

1178
01:10:39,323 --> 01:10:41,283
嘿 这只是一个小插曲
Hey, it was just a mistake.

1179
01:10:41,783 --> 01:10:43,118
还记得你告诉我的吗？
Remember what you told me?

1180
01:10:43,994 --> 01:10:45,078
这次不一样
This one's different.

1181
01:10:45,245 --> 01:10:46,246
为什么？
Why?

1182
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:47,831
因为这是我干的!
Because it's mine!

1183
01:10:59,676 --> 01:11:02,596
我应该和奶奶一样棒
I'm supposed to be as good as my grandma.

1184
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:05,265
我本该成为像样的霍桑家传人
I'm supposed to be a Hawthorne.

1185
01:11:08,185 --> 01:11:09,353
但我没有
But I'm not.

1186
01:11:22,699 --> 01:11:23,825
巴斯？
Buzz?

1187
01:11:25,994 --> 01:11:27,162
等一下 等一下
Wait a minute, hold on.

1188
01:11:27,329 --> 01:11:28,622
你不是我 我才是我
You're not me. I am me.

1189
01:11:28,789 --> 01:11:29,831
你现在就是你
You are you now.

1190
01:11:29,998 --> 01:11:32,000
但我是50年后的你
But I'm you 50 years from now.

1191
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:33,335
好吧 不可能有两个我
Well, there can't be two mes.

1192
01:11:33,502 --> 01:11:35,003
但我们都在这儿
Yet here we both are.

1193
01:11:35,671 --> 01:11:37,047
那么好吧 如果你是我
Okay then. If you're me.

1194
01:11:37,214 --> 01:11:38,882
我在想一个介于1和 --
I'm thinking of a number between one and--

1195
01:11:39,049 --> 01:11:40,634
1273.
1273.

1196
01:11:40,801 --> 01:11:41,802
哇哦
Whoa.

1197
01:11:42,775 --> 01:11:43,678
佐格
Zurg.

1198
01:11:43,762 --> 01:11:45,097
多可爱啊
Isn't that cute.

1199
01:11:45,264 --> 01:11:46,974
机器人不能清楚地说 "巴斯"
Robots can't quite say "Buzz."

1200
01:11:47,182 --> 01:11:49,429
所以在这里我就叫佐格
So around here I'm just Zurg.

1201
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:50,351
佐格
Zurg.

1202
01:11:50,435 --> 01:11:51,520
我想也是你
And I guess so are you.

1203
01:11:51,687 --> 01:11:52,688
怎么会呢？我不明白
How? I don't understand.

1204
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:54,815
别担心 这一切都不重要了
Do not worry about it. None of this is gonna matter.

1205
01:11:54,982 --> 01:11:55,816
巴斯
Buzz.

1206
01:11:55,983 --> 01:11:56,859
什么事？
Yes?

1207
01:11:57,025 --> 01:11:58,569
你必须向他解释这一切
You have to explain it all to him.

1208
01:11:59,361 --> 01:12:00,362
说得对
You're right.

1209
01:12:00,529 --> 01:12:02,823
很抱歉 我只是太兴奋了
I'm sorry, it's just exciting.

1210
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:04,449
你终于来了
You're finally here.

1211
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:07,077
看 我也达到了光速
See, I reached hyper-speed too.

1212
01:12:07,494 --> 01:12:08,954
光速
Hyper-speed.

1213
01:12:09,663 --> 01:12:11,206
和你一样
Like you did.

1214
01:12:12,082 --> 01:12:14,459
但我没有被当作英雄来迎接
But I wasn't greeted as a hero.

1215
01:12:15,419 --> 01:12:20,382
那个新指挥官要以偷窃XL-15的罪名逮捕我
No, that new Commander was gonna arrest me for stealing the XL-15.

1216
01:12:20,549 --> 01:12:24,178
我找到了让他们回家的方法 但他们都不在乎
I'd found a way to get them home, and they didn't even care.

1217
01:12:24,344 --> 01:12:25,304
所以我逃掉了
So I escaped.

1218
01:12:30,767 --> 01:12:34,021
我尽可能地走得远 尽可能地快
I went as far as I could, as fast as I could.

1219
01:12:34,688 --> 01:12:37,941
我以这种速度走了很久 已经走了几个世纪
At that speed for that long I'd traveled centuries.

1220
01:12:38,108 --> 01:12:41,904
而我最终来到了一个你无从得知的未来
And I ended up in a future you wouldn’t recognize.

1221
01:12:42,112 --> 01:12:44,698
充满了你无法想象的技术
Filled with technology you can't imagine.

1222
01:12:45,073 --> 01:12:47,534
就在那时 我彻底醒悟
And that's when it dawned on me.

1223
01:12:47,701 --> 01:12:50,954
如果我们能用这块晶体向前推进时间
If we can use this crystal to go forward in time.

1224
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:53,373
为什么不能用它来回到过去呢？
Why not use it to go back?

1225
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:55,209
但我们不能回到过去
But we can't go back in time.

1226
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:57,169
-我们现在可以 -什么？
-We can now. -What?

1227
01:12:57,377 --> 01:13:00,339
听着 巴斯 我已经打破了时间
Listen, Buzz, I've broken time.

1228
01:13:00,506 --> 01:13:03,511
发生在你身上的事从未发生在我身上
What's happening to you never happened to me.

1229
01:13:03,717 --> 01:13:07,054
这是个全新的现在 从来没有过的
This is a new now that's never been lived.

1230
01:13:07,221 --> 01:13:09,681
你看 我们可以改变历史 巴斯
You see, we can change things, Buzz.

1231
01:13:09,848 --> 01:13:13,894
如果我们能回到过去 我们可以阻止自己
Well, if we can go back in time we can stop ourselves

1232
01:13:14,061 --> 01:13:15,020
我们可以阻止自己降落在那个星球上
from ever landing on that planet.

1233
01:13:15,187 --> 01:13:16,355
不撞上那座山
From ever hitting that mountain.

1234
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:17,856
我们可以继续完成回家的任务
We can just continue the mission home.

1235
01:13:18,023 --> 01:13:19,650
而这一切都不会发生
And none of this will have ever happened.

1236
01:13:20,317 --> 01:13:21,735
这是个好计划
it's a good plan.

1237
01:13:22,027 --> 01:13:24,404
而这个晶体是这一切的关键
And this crystal is the key to it all.

1238
01:13:24,571 --> 01:13:26,031
等等 你不是已经有一个了吗？
Wait, don't you already have one?

1239
01:13:26,198 --> 01:13:27,699
嗯 算是吧
Well, sort of.

1240
01:13:28,992 --> 01:13:32,412
在测试时间旅行时 我把自己的晶体用光了
See, I wore my crystal out testing the time travel.

1241
01:13:32,579 --> 01:13:34,748
也把自己累坏了 花了不少时间
Wore myself out too. It took a while.

1242
01:13:34,915 --> 01:13:37,334
结果发现这并不是一门精确的科学
Turns out this isn't an exact science.

1243
01:13:37,501 --> 01:13:40,045
这是我能回到的最远的时间了
This is as far back in time as I could get.

1244
01:13:40,212 --> 01:13:42,381
来吧 帮我配置引擎
Come on, help me configure the engine.

1245
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:43,715
它应该看起来很眼熟
It should look familiar.

1246
01:13:43,882 --> 01:13:45,884
等等 这是基于萝卜号的吗?
Wait, is this based on the turnip?

1247
01:13:46,051 --> 01:13:47,719
设为反转 全速
Set it for reversed thrusters, full.

1248
01:13:50,347 --> 01:13:51,849
那么 这些都是我们设计的？
So, we designed all of this?

1249
01:13:52,057 --> 01:13:54,560
不 这都是借来的
No, this is all borrowed.

1250
01:13:54,726 --> 01:13:56,436
我只是做了一些修改
I just made some modifications.

1251
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:05,320
她又可以当太空游侠了 巴斯
She'll get to be a Space Ranger again, Buzz.

1252
01:14:06,905 --> 01:14:07,990
是啊
Yeah.

1253
01:14:08,407 --> 01:14:09,408
虽然...
Although...

1254
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:10,409
什么？
What?

1255
01:14:10,617 --> 01:14:13,537
嗯 她不会再有家人
Well, she won't have her family.

1256
01:14:14,121 --> 01:14:15,163
也不会有依奇了
She won't have Izzy.

1257
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:16,456
依奇是谁?
Who's Izzy?

1258
01:14:17,249 --> 01:14:19,272
听着 她不会想念任何人
Look, she's not gonna miss anyone

1259
01:14:19,356 --> 01:14:22,598
如果她一开始就没有遇到他们 对吗？
if she never meets them in the first place, right?

1260
01:14:23,922 --> 01:14:27,551
人们唯一得知的是我们完成了任务
The only thing people are gonna know is that we finished our mission.

1261
01:14:29,052 --> 01:14:31,221
把你的晶体递给我
Here. Hand me your crystal.

1262
01:14:34,141 --> 01:14:35,142
巴斯？
Buzz?

1263
01:14:36,143 --> 01:14:37,603
我不知道 也许...
I don't know, maybe...

1264
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:39,521
也许我们应该考虑一下
maybe we should think about this.

1265
01:14:39,688 --> 01:14:41,064
考虑什么？
Think about what?

1266
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:44,443
霍桑指挥官相信我们可以弥补我们犯下的这个错误
Commander Hawthorne believed we could fix this mistake we made.

1267
01:14:44,943 --> 01:14:47,321
而这种信念使她失去了一切
And that belief cost her everything.

1268
01:14:47,946 --> 01:14:50,365
哦 不 不 我们完全搞错了
Oh, no, no. We had that all wrong.

1269
01:14:50,532 --> 01:14:52,242
但她接下来有完整的人生
She had a whole life down there.

1270
01:14:52,409 --> 01:14:53,911
什么样的人生？
What kind of life?

1271
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:57,080
我们应该是太空游侠
We're supposed to be Space Rangers.

1272
01:14:57,706 --> 01:14:59,333
我们应该是重要的
We suppose to matter.

1273
01:15:00,083 --> 01:15:02,544
你不会想这样生活的 巴斯
You don't wanna live like this, Buzz.

1274
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:05,839
在同样的恶梦中醒来
Waking up with that same nightmare.

1275
01:15:06,006 --> 01:15:08,342
被你的错误所困扰
Haunted by your mistake.

1276
01:15:08,509 --> 01:15:10,886
你可以释怀了
But you can finally let go of that.

1277
01:15:11,345 --> 01:15:13,013
从现在开始
Starting right now.

1278
01:15:15,516 --> 01:15:16,517
你是对的
You're right.

1279
01:15:17,643 --> 01:15:19,019
我可以
I can.

1280
01:15:20,896 --> 01:15:21,897
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

1281
01:15:22,648 --> 01:15:24,525
你和我 我们不一样
You and me, we're not the same.

1282
01:15:25,192 --> 01:15:26,777
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1283
01:15:26,944 --> 01:15:28,111
不 巴斯
No, Buzz.

1284
01:15:28,987 --> 01:15:30,113
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1285
01:15:43,335 --> 01:15:44,294
嘿 猫
Hey, cat.

1286
01:15:44,461 --> 01:15:45,879
你知道怎么开这个东西吗？
Do you know how to fly this thing?

1287
01:15:46,046 --> 01:15:47,339
没有燃料了
There's no fuel.

1288
01:15:47,506 --> 01:15:50,425
你看 这就是我们为什么不该做超出能力的事
See, this is why we should never have gotten in over our heads.

1289
01:15:50,592 --> 01:15:51,510
你想做什么？
What did you wanna do?

1290
01:15:51,677 --> 01:15:53,220
在前哨站等着机器人找到我们？
Wait at the outpost until the robots found us?

1291
01:15:53,387 --> 01:15:55,013
这总比被困在这里好吧？
That's better than being stranded out here.

1292
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,515
总比被困在没有人会找到我们的地方要好
where no one's ever gonna find us.

1293
01:15:56,688 --> 01:15:59,983
你是我最不想在生死关头与之为伍的人
You are the last person I wanna be stuck with in a life-and-death situation.

1294
01:16:00,143 --> 01:16:01,270
好吧 你很幸运 好吗？
Well, you're in luck. Okay?

1295
01:16:01,436 --> 01:16:03,647
看看周围 这儿没什么生 只有死
Cause look around. This is just a death situation.

1296
01:16:03,814 --> 01:16:05,566
喵喵
Meow meow.

1297
01:16:07,234 --> 01:16:08,652
我已经完全失去了巴斯的踪迹
I've completely lost Buzz.

1298
01:16:09,695 --> 01:16:11,071
他离得太远了 无法追踪
He's too far away to track.

1299
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:28,922
各位 进去！
Everybody, inside!

1300
01:16:29,089 --> 01:16:29,923
什么？
What?

1301
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,551
进飞船来
Get inside the ship.

1302
01:16:35,262 --> 01:16:36,263
有什么在追我们吗？
What's after us now?

1303
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:37,431
我们没武器了
We don't have any more weapons.

1304
01:16:37,598 --> 01:16:38,932
没事 我们只是要离开这里
It's okay. We're getting out of here.

1305
01:16:39,092 --> 01:16:40,177
去哪里？
Where are we going?

1306
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:41,768
上太空
We're going into space.

1307
01:16:45,397 --> 01:16:47,191
嘿 放开我 不！
Hey, let go of me. No!

1308
01:16:48,609 --> 01:16:51,653
我不明白这里发生了什么 巴斯
I don't understand what's happening here, Buzz.

1309
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:53,530
你变了
You've changed.

1310
01:16:53,697 --> 01:16:55,699
而且不是变得更好
And not for the better.

1311
01:16:55,866 --> 01:16:56,867
不！
No!

1312
01:16:57,034 --> 01:16:59,828
你不能这样做 把这一切都抹杀掉
You can't do this. You're gonna erase it all.

1313
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:01,455
是的
Exactly.

1314
01:17:02,497 --> 01:17:04,374
不 你会夺走一切
No, you gonna take away everything.

1315
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:06,919
人们的家庭 他们的朋友
People's families, their friends.

1316
01:17:07,085 --> 01:17:08,504
我的朋友
My friends.

1317
01:17:08,962 --> 01:17:10,672
他们在那个星球上有自己的生活
They have lives on that planet.

1318
01:17:10,839 --> 01:17:12,299
每个人都是如此
Everyone does.

1319
01:17:12,841 --> 01:17:14,092
除了我们
Except for us.

1320
01:17:15,427 --> 01:17:18,055
我几乎认不出你了 巴斯
I hardly recognize you, Buzz.

1321
01:17:18,639 --> 01:17:21,058
这些新的想法...
All these new ideas...

1322
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,768
你知道吗？
You know what?

1323
01:17:22,935 --> 01:17:24,978
我们把这些也删掉吧
We'll go ahead and erase those too.

1324
01:17:27,607 --> 01:17:28,815
-哇哦 -我给你争取了5分钟
-Whoa. -I bought you five minutes.

1325
01:17:28,982 --> 01:17:29,942
为什么？
Why?

1326
01:17:30,108 --> 01:17:31,318
我喜欢这个新的你
I like this new you.

1327
01:17:33,153 --> 01:17:34,988
我们必须摧毁这艘船
We have to destroy this ship.

1328
01:17:35,405 --> 01:17:36,532
你能把我带到舰桥吗？
Can you get me to the bridge?

1329
01:17:36,698 --> 01:17:37,783
当然可以 跟着我
Certainly. Follow me.

1330
01:17:45,061 --> 01:17:45,955
佐格
Zurg.

1331
01:17:49,711 --> 01:17:52,005
惊喜派对行动 我们来了
Operation Surprise Party, here we go.

1332
01:17:52,207 --> 01:17:53,187
Zap, zap!
Zap, zap!

1333
01:17:54,174 --> 01:17:55,676
我们需要保护我们的逃生船
We need to protect our escape ship.

1334
01:17:55,843 --> 01:17:57,678
所以 不要别让任何机器人从那扇门进来
So, don't let any robots come through that door.

1335
01:17:57,845 --> 01:17:59,054
别担心 我们会把它封住的
Don't worry, we'll seal it off.

1336
01:17:59,221 --> 01:18:00,222
你去找巴斯
You go find Buzz.

1337
01:18:00,389 --> 01:18:01,765
我会追踪他身份牌上的芯片
I'll track the chip in his dog tags.

1338
01:18:01,932 --> 01:18:03,100
喵喵
Meow meow.

1339
01:18:04,309 --> 01:18:05,310
怎么了？
What's wrong?

1340
01:18:05,483 --> 01:18:08,069
我收到两个巴斯的信号 这不可能正确
I'm getting two Buzz signals. That's can't be right.

1341
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:10,691
我会进行三角定位 会让我们足够接近 来吧
I'll triangulate. That will get us close enough. Come on.

1342
01:18:11,859 --> 01:18:13,277
回来的捷径
A shortcut back.

1343
01:18:21,743 --> 01:18:22,744
这可真有意思
This is pretty neat.

1344
01:18:22,911 --> 01:18:23,704
我们得走了
We have to go.

1345
01:18:23,871 --> 01:18:24,872
好 好的
Yep, all right.

1346
01:18:33,213 --> 01:18:34,214
哦 太好了
Oh, great.

1347
01:18:34,381 --> 01:18:36,175
我不懂怎么控制
I don't know any of these controls.

1348
01:18:36,383 --> 01:18:37,384
等等 I. V. A. N. ？
Wait. I.V.A.N.?

1349
01:18:37,551 --> 01:18:38,427
是我 船长？
Yes, Captain?

1350
01:18:38,594 --> 01:18:40,387
孩子 我很高兴见到你
Boy, am I glad to see you.

1351
01:18:40,554 --> 01:18:42,764
启动两分钟自毁程序
Initiate self-destruct sequence in two minutes.

1352
01:18:42,931 --> 01:18:45,559
好的 自毁倒计时开始
You got it. Self-destruct countdown initiated.

1353
01:18:45,726 --> 01:18:48,228
巴斯 你不想要这些很酷的技术吗？
Buzz, you don't want any of this cool technology?

1354
01:18:48,395 --> 01:18:49,980
只有你 伙计 来吧
Only you, buddy, come on.

1355
01:18:50,564 --> 01:18:51,815
-叛徒！-不
-Traitor! -No.

1356
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:54,902
够了！
Enough!

1357
01:18:57,446 --> 01:18:59,823
只要告诉我晶体在哪里
Just tell me where the crystal is.

1358
01:19:00,866 --> 01:19:02,618
好吧 我们得保护我们的逃生船
Okay, we've gotta protect our escape ship.

1359
01:19:02,784 --> 01:19:04,119
那么 我们如何关闭这扇门呢？
So, how do we close this door?

1360
01:19:04,286 --> 01:19:05,204
我不知道
I don't know.

1361
01:19:05,363 --> 01:19:06,698
你说 "别担心 我们会把它封住的 "
What? You said, "don't worry we'll seal it off."

1362
01:19:06,872 --> 01:19:08,624
对 所以别担心 我们能办到的
Right, so don't worry. We will.

1363
01:19:09,917 --> 01:19:10,918
找到了
Here we go.

1364
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:12,586
看见了吧?
Look, see?

1365
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:13,921
怎么？
What?

1366
01:19:20,344 --> 01:19:21,386
喵喵喵
Meow meow.

1367
01:19:21,553 --> 01:19:23,138
现在信号更强了
The signal is tighter now.

1368
01:19:23,305 --> 01:19:24,515
他肯定在这边直走的方向
He has to be straight this way.

1369
01:19:26,642 --> 01:19:28,227
真是一个巨大的空间
That's a lot of space.

1370
01:19:28,393 --> 01:19:30,354
在一起 在一起
Keep it together. Keep it together.

1371
01:19:30,896 --> 01:19:32,314
不！
No!

1372
01:19:33,732 --> 01:19:36,860
我不明白 信号显示巴斯在50米外
I don't understand. The signal says Buzz is 50 meters away.

1373
01:19:37,819 --> 01:19:39,696
他在那边
He's over there.

1374
01:19:41,281 --> 01:19:42,991
你以为我们不一样吗 巴斯？
You think we're not the same, Buzz?

1375
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:46,161
你已经是我了 只是你还不知道
You're already me, you just don't know it yet.

1376
01:19:46,328 --> 01:19:47,746
我永远不会成为你！
I'm never gonna be you!

1377
01:19:47,913 --> 01:19:51,250
如果你不成为我 那就不再会有你了
If you're not gonna be me you're not gonna be anyone.

1378
01:19:54,795 --> 01:19:56,797
人工重力解除
Artificial gravity disengaged.

1379
01:19:57,047 --> 01:19:58,173
该死
Blast.

1380
01:19:59,091 --> 01:20:00,092
不 不
No, no.

1381
01:20:05,472 --> 01:20:07,307
-嘿 你在做什么？-造个炸弹
-Hey, what are you doing? -Building a bomb.

1382
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:08,559
好啊 你需要笔吗？
Nice, do you need a pen?

1383
01:20:08,725 --> 01:20:09,643
不 给
No. Here.

1384
01:20:10,853 --> 01:20:11,854
哦 谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

1385
01:20:12,521 --> 01:20:13,522
薄荷糖
Peppermint.

1386
01:20:13,689 --> 01:20:14,731
把包装纸给我
Give me the wrapper.

1387
01:20:14,898 --> 01:20:17,192
那么 你就可以用这些东西造一个炸弹了？
So, you can just build a bomb out of that stuff?

1388
01:20:17,365 --> 01:20:18,867
还差点东西 现在把口香糖给我
I worked with less. Now give me the gum.

1389
01:20:19,027 --> 01:20:21,029
等等 我还没吃够呢 味道还很足
Wait, I'm not done, there's still a lot of flavor left.

1390
01:20:21,196 --> 01:20:22,197
给我！
Come on!

1391
01:20:23,657 --> 01:20:26,285
瞧吧 当他们踩到它 就会爆炸
There. When they step on it it will blow up.

1392
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:27,536
如果他们不踩呢？
What if they don't step on it?

1393
01:20:27,703 --> 01:20:29,663
我是说 反正我不会踩 你会吗？
I mean, I wouldn't step on that, would you?

1394
01:20:30,622 --> 01:20:32,833
那我们就得往上面扔重物
Then we need to drop something heavy on it.

1395
01:20:39,339 --> 01:20:40,883
-只要... -不！
-Just gonna... -No!

1396
01:20:50,726 --> 01:20:51,727
巴斯？
Buzz?

1397
01:20:51,894 --> 01:20:53,103
巴斯？ 巴斯！
Buzz!

1398
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:54,271
阿丽莎？
Alisha?

1399
01:20:55,731 --> 01:20:57,274
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

1400
01:20:59,234 --> 01:21:02,988
不 我一个人做不到 我需要帮助
No. I can't do it alone. I need help.

1401
01:21:03,356 --> 01:21:06,484
我不是我奶奶
I'm not my grandma.

1402
01:21:06,658 --> 01:21:11,079
依奇 我需要的不是你奶奶 我需要的是你
Izzy, I don't need your grandma, I need you.

1403
01:21:13,415 --> 01:21:14,917
索克斯 我们怎么去那里？
Sox, how do we get over there?

1404
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:16,084
通过气闸
Through the airlock.

1405
01:21:17,294 --> 01:21:18,337
通过那里？
Through there?

1406
01:21:18,504 --> 01:21:19,630
外面什么都没有
There's nothing out there.

1407
01:21:19,796 --> 01:21:21,590
正是如此 没有东西挡你的路
Exactly. Nothing in your way.

1408
01:21:21,757 --> 01:21:23,217
可以直接过去
You just go straight across.

1409
01:21:23,383 --> 01:21:24,384
才不！
No!

1410
01:21:27,179 --> 01:21:28,722
让我把话说清楚 当这东西落在你的炸弹上时
Let me get this straight, when this falls on your bomb

1411
01:21:28,889 --> 01:21:29,973
-它一定会爆炸的 -是的
-it will definitely explode. -Yes.

1412
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:31,141
-那就能封住门？-是的
-And that will seal the door? -Yes.

1413
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:32,851
但是我们最好抓紧时间
But we better hurry.

1414
01:21:33,018 --> 01:21:34,228
我已经抓紧了
I am hurrying.

1415
01:21:34,853 --> 01:21:36,480
你怎么不抓紧呢?
Why don't you hurry?

1416
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:39,066
加油啊
Come on.

1417
01:21:51,703 --> 01:21:52,371
好
Okay.

1418
01:21:55,332 --> 01:21:57,584
你行的 依奇
Come on, Izzy.

1419
01:21:57,751 --> 01:21:59,378
你做得到
You got this.

1420
01:22:00,671 --> 01:22:02,172
哦 伙计
Oh, man.

1421
01:22:04,675 --> 01:22:06,009
哦 不
Oh, no.

1422
01:22:07,052 --> 01:22:10,722
只要不往下看 也不往上看 这就是空间
Just don't look down, or up. It's all space.

1423
01:22:11,265 --> 01:22:13,225
它无处不在 在你周围
It's everywhere. All around you.

1424
01:22:13,934 --> 01:22:15,853
我很抱歉 我可能没帮上忙
I'm sorry, I'm probably not helping.

1425
01:22:16,019 --> 01:22:17,229
只管直走
Just go straight.

1426
01:22:17,938 --> 01:22:20,774
一旦你推开自己 就会朝那个方向过去
Once you push off that the direction you'll go.

1427
01:22:21,733 --> 01:22:23,110
但如果我错过了呢？
But what if I miss?

1428
01:22:23,777 --> 01:22:24,862
别错过
Don't miss.

1429
01:22:58,270 --> 01:22:59,229
什么？哦 不
What? Oh, no.

1430
01:22:59,605 --> 01:23:00,939
不 不！
No, no!

1431
01:23:09,615 --> 01:23:10,490
哇！
Whoa!

1432
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:13,202
索克斯！
Sox!

1433
01:23:19,499 --> 01:23:20,501
谢谢你 依奇
Thank you, Izzy.

1434
01:23:35,724 --> 01:23:37,226
进不去
There is no way in.

1435
01:23:37,392 --> 01:23:38,644
也许我可以帮忙
Perhaps I could help.

1436
01:23:46,568 --> 01:23:48,612
你不能躲着我 巴斯
You can't hide for me, Buzz.

1437
01:23:48,779 --> 01:23:50,822
这就像在躲自己
It's like hiding from yourself.

1438
01:23:51,073 --> 01:23:52,866
我会找到你的
I'll always find you.

1439
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:20,352
手动超控启动
Manual override activated.

1440
01:24:33,782 --> 01:24:34,908
-巴斯！-就现在！
-Buzz! -Now!

1441
01:24:41,874 --> 01:24:43,125
来吧 我们离开这里！
Come on, let's get outta here!

1442
01:24:43,292 --> 01:24:44,418
我们必须炸毁这艘飞船
We have to blow up the ship.

1443
01:24:44,585 --> 01:24:46,003
没有时间了 我们不可能成功的
There's no time. We'll never make it.

1444
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:47,671
哦 是的 我们能
Oh, yes, we will.

1445
01:24:55,596 --> 01:24:59,141
自毁程序倒数10...
Self-destruct sequence complete in ten...

1446
01:24:59,975 --> 01:25:02,060
-... 9 8... -I.V.A.N. ？I.V.A.N.!
-...nine, eight... -I.V.A.N.? I.V.A.N.!

1447
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:03,707
佐格.
Zurg.

1448
01:25:05,814 --> 01:25:06,899
达比 我们必须投降
Darby, we have to surrender.

1449
01:25:07,065 --> 01:25:09,234
不 我不会放弃的
No! I am not giving up.

1450
01:25:09,401 --> 01:25:11,528
是的 我也是 抓紧了
Yep, neither am I. Hold on.

1451
01:25:19,453 --> 01:25:21,538
-... 5 4... -我们走吧
-...five, four... -Let's go.

1452
01:25:22,206 --> 01:25:24,541
-... ...3 2... -大家都进来
-...three, two... -Everyone, get in.

1453
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:25,959

1454
01:26:21,765 --> 01:26:22,933
巴斯光年任务日志

1455
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:25,686
我们已经摧毁了佐格飞船和佐格本人
We've destroyed the Zurg's ship and Zurg himself.

1456
01:26:25,853 --> 01:26:28,272
现在我只需要追上犰狳号 以便...
Now I just have to catch up to the Armadillo in order to--

1457
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:31,191
你要去哪儿？
Going somewhere?

1458
01:26:32,359 --> 01:26:34,653
警告 引擎灾难性损坏
Warning, engine damage is catastrophic.

1459

Buzz Lightyear mission log. I now have the crystal in my possession,

1460

终于可以完成任务了
and can finally, at long last finish the mission.

1461
01:26:46,164 --> 01:26:48,667
我要回去重来 巴斯
I'm gonna go back and matter again, Buzz.

1462
01:26:49,084 --> 01:26:50,210
你呢？
And you?

1463
01:26:50,395 --> 01:26:52,939
你会像从没存在过
You will be like you have never here.

1464
01:26:53,589 --> 01:26:56,466
准备去死吧
Prepare to die.

1465
01:27:02,181 --> 01:27:03,432
今天不行 佐格
Not today, Zurg.

1466
01:27:12,232 --> 01:27:14,234
我们已经进入了这个星球的引力范围
We've entered the planet's gravitational pull.

1467
01:27:14,401 --> 01:27:15,360
我们会坠毁吗？
Are we gonna crash?

1468
01:27:15,527 --> 01:27:16,653
恐怕是的
I'm afraid so.

1469
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:31,293
巴斯！
Buzz!

1470
01:27:45,057 --> 01:27:46,225
我做不到
I can't do it.

1471
01:27:46,391 --> 01:27:48,227
巴斯 没关系的
Buzz, it's okay.

1472
01:27:48,393 --> 01:27:49,228
我们可以
We can.

1473
01:27:50,395 --> 01:27:51,855
你能保持飞船稳定吗？
Can you keep the ship steady?

1474
01:27:52,272 --> 01:27:53,857
是的 我想可以
Yeah. I think so.

1475
01:27:57,402 --> 01:28:01,490
好的 索克斯 把应急电池与飞行控制的电源接上
Okay, Sox, fuse the emergency battery the power of flight controls.

1476
01:28:01,907 --> 01:28:02,908
明白
Got it.

1477
01:28:03,992 --> 01:28:04,993
我需要一个副驾驶
I'll need a co-pilot.

1478
01:28:06,042 --> 01:28:08,169
好的 但我只在模拟器上做过这个
Okay, but I've only done this in the simulator.

1479
01:28:08,372 --> 01:28:09,957
好 那现在就要来真的了
Well, it's about to get real.

1480
01:28:10,214 --> 01:28:12,675
记住 向后拉动操纵杆--
Remember, pull back on the yoke--

1481
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:16,922
-放松点 -是的 对不起 从现在开始 我会好好干
-Easy. -Yep. Sorry. Nice and easy from now on.

1482
01:28:18,966 --> 01:28:20,092
没用的！
It's not working!

1483
01:28:20,259 --> 01:28:21,844
我们速度太快了
We're going in too fast.

1484
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:23,136
-I. V. A. N. -是的 船长？
-I.V.A.N. -Yes, Captain?

1485
01:28:23,303 --> 01:28:25,389
-我们太快了 -恭喜！
-We're going too fast. -Congratulations!

1486
01:28:26,849 --> 01:28:28,809
我们不要纸屑 我们要减速！
We don't need confetti, we need brakes!

1487
01:28:28,969 --> 01:28:29,636
哦 我知道了！
Oh, I know!

1488
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:31,436
-反推装置！-在地板上
-The air brake! -On the floor.

1489
01:28:31,603 --> 01:28:32,688
达比！
Darby!

1490
01:28:33,564 --> 01:28:35,357
-它卡住了 -什么？
-It's stuck. -What?

1491
01:28:35,524 --> 01:28:36,984
盖子 它被卡住了
The cover, it's stuck.

1492
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:39,111
我需要一把螺丝刀 或者一把剪子
I need a screwdriver, or a hair clipper

1493
01:28:39,278 --> 01:28:40,821
小锥子什么的
Some sort of a small wedge.

1494
01:28:41,864 --> 01:28:43,532
我有笔！
I've got the pen!

1495
01:29:03,468 --> 01:29:05,012
-巴斯！- 大家都还好吗？
-Buzz! - Is everyone okay?

1496
01:29:05,179 --> 01:29:06,885
-是的 -我想是的
-Yeah. -I think so.

1497
01:29:08,515 --> 01:29:10,434
是条子！大家快跑！
The cops! Everybody, run!

1498
01:29:10,601 --> 01:29:13,061
等等 这只是救援队
Wait. It's just the rescue team.

1499
01:29:13,896 --> 01:29:15,522
对 好的
Right. Okay.

1500
01:29:16,315 --> 01:29:19,610
你看起来是个正直的人 怎么会被关起来？
You seem like a decent citizen. What led to your incarceration?

1501
01:29:19,776 --> 01:29:21,361
我偷了艘飞船
I stole a ship.

1502
01:29:22,571 --> 01:29:26,408
我们中谁又没在绝望的时候...
Who among us hasn't stolen a ship in a moment of...

1503
01:29:27,326 --> 01:29:28,327
偷过什么飞船呢？
relative desperation?

1504
01:29:28,493 --> 01:29:31,705
我是个足智多谋的人 我的武器就是聪明才智
I'm a man of resources. My weapon is ingenuity.

1505
01:29:31,872 --> 01:29:33,248
我可以做任何事情！
I can do anything!

1506
01:29:33,415 --> 01:29:34,666
能别在我耳边大叫吗？
Can you not shout in my ear?

1507
01:29:34,833 --> 01:29:35,959
是的 对不起
Yep, sorry.

1508
01:29:46,671 --> 01:29:47,672
还好吗？
You're okay?

1509
01:29:49,389 --> 01:29:50,599
我上过了太空了
I was in space.

1510
01:29:52,392 --> 01:29:54,228
你奶奶会以此为傲
Your grandma would be proud.

1511
01:29:55,562 --> 01:29:57,147
她也会以你为傲
She'd be proud of you too.

1512
01:29:59,066 --> 01:30:00,776
她一直如此
She always was.

1513
01:30:03,237 --> 01:30:05,155
等等 你的晶体呢？
Wait. Where is your crystal?

1514
01:30:05,781 --> 01:30:06,949
没了
It's gone.

1515
01:30:07,115 --> 01:30:08,825
但你的任务...
But your mission...

1516
01:30:09,576 --> 01:30:10,744
你不是想回家吗
You wanted to go home.

1517
01:30:11,745 --> 01:30:14,373
你知道吗 这么久以来 第一次
You know, for the first time in a long time

1518
01:30:15,707 --> 01:30:17,501
我觉得我已经到家了
I feel like I am home.

1519
01:30:25,958 --> 01:30:26,801
佐格
Zurg.

1520
01:30:26,885 --> 01:30:28,011
小心！
Look out!

1521
01:30:30,441 --> 01:30:31,306
哇？
Whoa?

1522
01:30:37,271 --> 01:30:38,647
不许动！
Stop right now!

1523
01:30:40,732 --> 01:30:42,150
光年
Lightyear.

1524
01:30:43,694 --> 01:30:48,031
你盗窃了星际指挥部的财产 偷了实验飞船
You absconded with Star Command property, stolen experimental spacecraft

1525
01:30:48,198 --> 01:30:50,450
并违抗你指挥官的命令
and defied a direct order from your commander.

1526
01:30:50,610 --> 01:30:52,696
我应该关你的禁闭
I gotta throw you into stockade.

1527
01:30:54,204 --> 01:30:57,749
但我为你制定了别的计划
But I have other plans for you.

1528
01:30:59,126 --> 01:31:02,379
我们想让你建立一个新的太空游侠团队
We want you to start a new version of the Space Ranger Corps.

1529
01:31:02,546 --> 01:31:04,673
宇宙保护部
Universe Protection Division.

1530
01:31:04,882 --> 01:31:07,050
你将再次成为一名太空游侠 巴斯
You're gonna be a Space Ranger again, Buzz.

1531
01:31:09,178 --> 01:31:12,358
你可以从扎普巡逻队的精英中亲自挑选你的团队
You can hand-select your team from the very best of the Zap Patrol

1532
01:31:12,442 --> 01:31:13,682
并按照你的喜好训练他们
and train them to your liking.

1533
01:31:13,766 --> 01:31:14,869
Zap, zap!
Zap, zap!

1534
01:31:16,977 --> 01:31:19,220
好吧 你真好 先生
Well, that's very kind of you, sir.

1535
01:31:19,304 --> 01:31:21,361
但恐怕我不得不拒绝
But I'm afraid I'm going to have to decline.

1536
01:31:24,735 --> 01:31:26,153
我已经有了自己的团队
I already have my team.

1537
01:31:37,532 --> 01:31:41,036
这些新装备真牛X 臂部发射器 还有火箭翼
These new suits are amazing. Arm blaster, rocket wings.

1538
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:42,377
都抵不过一只笔
It could use a pen though.

1539
01:31:42,586 --> 01:31:45,631
真不敢相信我被允许携带武器了 要是双枪就更好了
I can't believe I'm allowed to carry this. I wish I had two of them.

1540
01:31:45,797 --> 01:31:48,217
你现在的记录干干净净 又有自由了 又有装备了
You got a clean record. and you're free and armed.

1541
01:31:48,383 --> 01:31:49,510
还抱怨个什么？
How are you still complaining?

1542
01:31:49,676 --> 01:31:52,012
我是因为表现良好而被释放的 而不是因为态度好
I got off for good behavior, not good attitude.

1543
01:31:52,179 --> 01:31:53,347
你知道 我本来从不穿裤子
You know, I never wear pants,

1544
01:31:53,514 --> 01:31:55,599
但突然觉得不穿裤子很奇怪
but suddenly it feels weird to not be wearing pants.

1545
01:31:55,766 --> 01:31:56,934
不穿裤子看起来很奇怪吗？
Does it look weird without pants?

1546
01:31:57,093 --> 01:31:58,094
不 看起来很好
No, you look good.

1547
01:31:58,435 --> 01:31:59,561
我希望我可以把它拉下来
I wish I could pull that off.

1548
01:32:06,026 --> 01:32:09,279
瞧啊 奶奶 我成为了太空游侠
Look, Grandma, I'm a Space Ranger.

1549
01:32:09,446 --> 01:32:10,906
就像你一样
Just like you.

1550
01:32:22,167 --> 01:32:26,713
好了 队员们 我们在第四区的伽马象限发现了一个信号
All right, team, we've picked up a signal in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector 4.

1551
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:30,342
我们不知道它是什么 但我们不会等待它来入侵我们的家园
We don't know what it is, but we're not gonna wait for it to invade our home.

1552
01:32:30,509 --> 01:32:32,845
收到 指挥官 不会让你失望的
Copy, Commander. You can count on us.

1556
01:32:41,478 --> 01:32:44,064
我们的任务是保护星系不受任何敌人入侵
we've been charged to protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion

1557
01:32:44,231 --> 01:32:47,276
任何星系联盟的死敌
from any sworn enemies of The Galaxy Alliance.

1558
01:32:47,818 --> 01:32:50,362
好了 各位 请确保你们都系好了安全带
Okay, everyone, make sure you're securely fastened.

-Sustenance? -I brought sandwiches.

1561
01:32:54,533 --> 01:32:55,993
你不会因此吐一飞船？
And your tummy will be okay?

1562
01:32:56,326 --> 01:32:57,911
-都准备好了 -好的
-All set. -All right.

1563
01:32:58,996 --> 01:33:00,289
我有没有忘了什么？
Am I forgetting anything?

1564
01:33:00,664 --> 01:33:02,082
我想我们已经一切就绪
I think we're ready.

1565
01:33:16,972 --> 01:33:20,100
你好 我是你的内置声控导航仪
Hello, I am your internal voice-activated navigator.

1566
01:33:20,267 --> 01:33:21,727
很高兴你能回来 I. V. A. N.
Good to have you back, I.V.A.N.

1567
01:33:22,144 --> 01:33:23,645
光年船长 准备发射

1568
01:33:23,937 --> 01:33:24,938
-索克斯？-喵？

1569
01:33:29,318 --> 01:33:31,612
I.V.A.N. 启动光速飞行
I.V.A.N., initiate hyper-launch.

1570
01:33:31,778 --> 01:33:32,654

1571
01:33:34,448 --> 01:33:36,909
好了 太空游侠们 出发
All right, Space Rangers. Here we go.

1572
01:33:37,075 --> 01:33:38,285
飞向宇宙
To infinity

1573
01:33:39,912 --> 01:33:41,121
浩瀚无垠
and beyond.

1574
01:33:45,596 --> 01:33:47,696
01:35:50和01:43:37还有彩蛋

you'll want to head south past the bromite swamps,

1578
01:43:42,514 --> 01:43:45,058
令人叹为观止的景色 至少我听说是这样

但如果你赶时间 这将是你最近的路线
But if you are in a hurry, this would be your most direct route.

1580

还有问题吗？
Any questions?

1581
01:43:51,023 --> 01:43:52,024
人呢？
