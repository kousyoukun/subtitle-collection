1
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,448
"...to move out
and leave Staten Island forever."

2
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,766
<i>Good morning, what you doin'?</i>

3
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,127
<i>Besides stalking JP of course?</i>

4
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,441
I'm reading the news,
thank you very much.

5
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,650
<i>Oh, you're reading the
news, you're such a good liar.</i>

6
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,644
Seriously, how do you
know I'm stalking JP?

7
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,609
<i>Because I know
you very very well.</i>

8
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,842
<i>Oh, wait, did you tell your
mom about CalArts yet?</i>

9
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,402
Yeah, I told her. She's super excited
for me to move across the country

10
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,130
and go to a really
expensive art school.

11
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,611
<i>Really?</i>

12
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,250
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>No?</i>

13
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,290
No, I haven't found, I haven't found
the right time to tell her.

14
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,647
<i>Oh, Nerve is starting.</i>

15
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,290
<i>Sorry, this is really important.</i>

16
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,482
- What's Nerve?
- It's a game.

17
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,086
<i>Here, just click on the video.</i>

18
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,241
<i>Welcome to Nerve New York City.</i>

19
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,086
<i>Nerve is a 24-hour game,
like Truth or Dare, minus the Truth.</i>

20
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,609
<i>Watchers pay to watch.
Players play to win, cash and glory.</i>

21
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,162
<i>Are you a watcher or a player?
Are you a watcher or a player?</i>

22
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,081
<i>Are you a watcher or a player?</i>

23
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,520
<i>It's cool, right?</i>

24
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,888
This looks very sketchy.
Is this legal?

25
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,849
<i>I don't know, probably not.</i>

26
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,649
<i>Just do it, just sign up and watch,
time's ticking.</i>

27
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,767
Okay, signing UP-

28
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,968
Look, this is me
signing up to watch you.

29
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,929
<i>Vee, you have to
sign up and watch me.</i>

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,650
<i>It's very important
that I have Watchers.</i>

31
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,085
- Hey!
- I gotta go. My mom just got home.

32
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,650
- <i>Just</i> do it.
- I'll sign up after breakfast,

33
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,926
- I <i>promise.</i>
- <i>Thank you, I love you,</i>

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,764
- <i>I'll see you in</i> a <i>little bit.</i>
- <i>Bye.</i>

35
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,285
<i>Bye.</i>

36
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,808
I mean Syd hasn't gotten
into any schools yet.

37
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,211
And she doesn't even care.

38
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,568
You know what, Sydney doesn't
have to care, she has a trust fund.

39
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,881
And you have something far
more valuable than that.

40
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,961
Here we go.

41
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,407
You have drive, you have focus.

42
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,051
You have a scholarship
to a local college.

43
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,804
And even though we
can't afford the dorm,

44
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,602
you get to have me
as your new college roommate.

45
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,561
Actually, I, um... I have
kind of a cool idea about that.

46
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,690
What if we fixed up Mike's room
and listed you on Airbnb or something.

47
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,243
Maybe it's time we finally
go through his stuff

48
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,243
and maybe give some of it to Goodwill.

49
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,688
- And I could give you some space.
- I don't want space.

50
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,124
I just want you.

51
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,765
Okay.
I'm totally down with commuting.

52
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,121
I can get my reading
done on the ferry.

53
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,201
Yeah?

54
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,805
That'll work, right?

55
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,484
Yeah.

56
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,765
Let's say, "Go Cougars"
on the count of one, two three!

57
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,968
Go Cougars!

58
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,771
Let's go, Cougars!

59
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,481
Let's go, Cougars!
Let's go, Cougars!

60
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,528
- Hand me the zoom lens.
- Here.

61
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,761
Doesn't it feel a little unbalanced

62
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,684
if every single yearbook
photo is of JP Guerrero?

63
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,967
It's not my fault he's on the team.

64
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,844
- Alright, boys, here we go!
- Here.

65
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,045
Alright, careful, careful.

66
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,045
Let's hit it, JP!

67
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,169
Alright, let's go, let's go!
Come on!

68
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,689
Watch out, watch out, watch out!
Yeah, you got it. Alright, be careful!

69
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,721
Let's go, Cougars!

70
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,527
Let's go, Cougars!

71
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,168
Let's go, Cougars!

72
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,445
Liv, Liv!

73
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,722
Let's show them
what we got, Cougars!

74
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,001
Okay, let's play foot--
Where you goin', Syd?

75
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,650
Okay, we lost our cheerleader.

76
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,082
Alright, let's show
'em what we got VHS!

77
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,400
Are you ready,
remember what to do?

78
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,641
Okay.

79
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,007
- Okay, you're on!
- Hey, watchers!

80
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,163
<i>It's Syd Baby. I'm counting on you
to get me to the final round.</i>

81
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,642
<i>So don't let me down
and I won't let you down, I promise.</i>

82
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,841
Let's go, VHS!

83
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,480
Go, dude, show 'em what we got!

84
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,040
Show 'em what
Staten Island's really about!

85
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,811
Go cheer, baby!

86
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,727
How 'bout that ass, though?

87
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,802
Okay, thank you, Sydney.

88
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,008
<i>You guys dared
me to eat dog food.</i>

89
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,730
<i>You can do this,
just don't think about it.</i>

90
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,882
<i>This is so
gross, this is so gross.</i>

91
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,287
<i>Okay, keep it in.</i>

92
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,490
<i>Wassup, Watchers?</i>

93
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,768
<i>Money, money.</i>

94
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,366
- <i>I have so many Watchers now.</i>
- <i>Yeah, you do, girl!</i>

95
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,926
<i>I just need to get in that little
box thing. Who's winning now?</i>

96
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,049
Apparently, this guy named Ryan.

97
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,010
I guess he put peanut butter on his junk
and let his dog lick it off.

98
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,445
- What?
- I could do that.

99
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,204
But you don't have a dog.

100
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,806
- I could still do it.
- Or a dick, Liv.

101
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,609
They're coming
up with your next dare!

102
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,286
What is it? I need something flashy
like the peanut butter thing.

103
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,601
H6)'-

104
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,920
Oh, my God, how weird.

105
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,411
How do they know you're
afraid of heights?

106
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,642
- What?
- That's what they do, it's easy.

107
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,563
They just take all your
info from your old profiles

108
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,801
and put it in your Nerve profile.

109
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,565
- That's so creepy.
- You just got suspended.

110
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,120
- I thought you were done playing Nerve.
- Hell no!

111
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,771
The girl who won Seattle now
has millions of followers.

112
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,002
- She is insta-famous.
- Who cares?

113
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,971
I care, Vee.
I don't expect you to understand.

114
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,690
I'm an adrenaline junkie.

115
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,240
You like to stay within your
comfort zone, that's fine.

116
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,011
That's not true. What about
that pole dancing class we took?

117
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,924
Vee, I dragged you there
and you sat in the corner and watched.

118
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,651
- I'm a visual learner.
- Why are you attacking her?

119
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,768
- I'm not attacking her, Tommy.
- Yeah, you are.

120
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,921
Life is passing you by.

121
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,646
You need to learn to take a few
risks every once in a while.

122
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,166
- I do take risks.
- Really?

123
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,280
Okay, fine. Let's just say,
hypothetically, you're playing Nerve.

124
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,805
What'd be a good
Nerve dare for Vee?

125
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,882
Make out with JP.

126
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,930
Baby steps, baby steps.
Just talk to JP.

127
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,126
What?

128
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,486
He probably likes you, too.

129
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,329
You'll just never know
if you don't talk to him.

130
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,846
And then everybody that's watching you
they would just go on and vote.

131
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,969
Who wants to see
Vee mackin' on JP?

132
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,849
<i>- Oh, my God!
- YOU guys!</i>

133
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,127
All who wanna see
Vee macking on JP say "Yes."

134
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,929
Yes!

135
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,081
Yes, yes.

136
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,810
- I assume, "No"?
- Abstain.

137
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,010
- Thank you.
- Alright, you've been dared.

138
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,088
Do you accept your dare, Vee?

139
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,367
Say, "Yes."
Say, "Yes."

140
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,044
What's the point?
We're graduating, I--

141
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,283
- All you have to do is say, "Hi."
- I don't want to say "Hello" to him.

142
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,287
Fine. I love you so much, Vee,
but you're a Watcher.

143
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,600
So watch me do it for you.

144
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,290
- No no no, Syd, Syd, Syd.
- Just watch.

145
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,044
No,no,no,Syd,no.

146
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,811
Yeah, Sydney!

147
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,848
Why don't you show us
the front next time?

148
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,083
You first, Chuck.
I hear it's really big.

149
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,050
Guess it's average.

150
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,203
- Hey, JP.
- What's up?

151
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,325
I was wondering, do you
have a girlfriend right now?

152
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,401
No!

153
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,962
It's not for me, it's for a friend.

154
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,084
Well, which friend?

155
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,043
No, she's not my type.

156
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,202
You're not nearly
as hot as you think you are.

157
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,203
- Yes, he is!
- And you are a douchebag.

158
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,927
No, don't go, come on.

159
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,081
Vee, Vee!

160
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,484
Just let her go.
Not cool, Sydney.

161
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,210
I'm just trying to help her.

162
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,005
- Let's not help her.
- She'll figure it out.

163
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,651
<i>Hello, welcome to Nerve.</i>

164
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,007
<i>You have chosen Player.</i>

165
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,684
<i>Nerve is a direct democracy.</i>

166
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,808
<i>Watchers decide your dares.</i>

167
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,689
<i>The two Players with
the most Watchers</i>

168
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,889
<i>by the end of regulation
will advance to the final round</i>

169
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,530
<i>where the winner takes all.</i>

170
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,207
<i>Watchers can watch from anywhere
but they are encouraged to film live.</i>

171
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,443
<i>So don't be alarmed.
There are three rules:</i>

172
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,524
<i>One, all dares must be
filmed on the Player's phone.</i>

173
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,046
<i>Two, there are only two
ways to be eliminated.</i>

174
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,168
<i>Fail or bail.</i>

175
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,528
<i>Three, snitches get stitches.</i>

176
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,491
<i>Thank you for keeping Nerve a secret.
Good luck, Player.</i>

177
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,405
<i>Hey, it's Vee, I'm not here right now--</i>

178
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,245
<i>Vee, you have
to sign up and watch me.</i>

179
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,725
<i>...for account information, press one.</i>

180
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,207
<i>For phone or credit card information...</i>

181
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,164
- <i>Tommy.</i>
- <i>Hey, I'm pulling up outside.</i>

182
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,241
<i>What the hell's so urgent?</i>

183
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,924
We have to go to Colonnade Diner,
we have 15 minutes.

184
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,206
<i>WW, What's going on?</i>

185
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,487
I signed up for Nerve
and that's where my first dare is.

186
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,645
What do you mean,
you signed up as a Player?

187
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,085
Oh, man.

188
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,128
What, is that so hard to believe?

189
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,323
You know that some kid supposedly
died in Seattle playing Nerve?

190
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,166
I don't buy that. If kids were dying,
the game would be shut down.

191
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,164
No, they can't shut it down.
There's not a single server.

192
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,401
What does that mean?

193
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,609
Everybody that logs onto
the game becomes a new server.

194
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,887
So it's impossible
to turn the game off.

195
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,485
How do you even know
so much about this game?

196
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,561
You've never even played.

197
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,802
Look, I spend a lot of time
on the dark web, alright?

198
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,211
Oh a lot of time on the dark web?

199
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,282
- Is that right, hacker boy?
- Yes, that is right.

200
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,445
You're only accessing ten percent
of the Internet, you know.

201
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,324
Why are you even doing this?

202
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,402
Seriously, it's dangerous.

203
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,084
Is it because of Sydney?

204
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,606
This is not about Sydney. I'm...

205
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,762
It's just not like you.

206
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,564
That's the point.

207
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,488
<i>Kiss a stranger for five seconds?</i>

208
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,326
<i>A stranger, Vee,
I'll give you 100 dollars.</i>

209
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,087
Okay, Okay-

210
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,969
You're just gonna
kiss some random person?

211
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,683
He has a girlfriend.

212
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,684
Just kiss that guy.

213
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,131
- Okay, I'm gonna kiss that guy.
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

214
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,531
Gonna do it.

215
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,243
Or that guy, he reads.

216
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,522
Well, make a choice, clock's ticking.

217
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,250
- Hi.
- Hey.

218
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,885
I'm kissing that guy.

219
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,362
Okay, you sit here,
tell me when you're rolling, okay?

220
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,886
Okay, it's Mission Impossible now?

221
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,246
Just go.

222
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,571
<i>To... To the Lighthouse,
that's my favorite book.</i>

223
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,721
Really?

224
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,481
Please, tell me they get to
the lighthouse in the end.

225
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,762
Actually, don't tell me.

226
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,524
Okay, just tell me real quick.

227
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,565
Yeah, they do, but that's,
that's not really what it's about.

228
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,927
The lighthouse means something
different to each of the characters.

229
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,129
It basically represents the
thing they want most in life.

230
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,761
And I'm sorry that I'm totally
geeking out and ruining the story.

231
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,320
No, I was the one who asked.

232
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,883
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi, three Mississippi,

233
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,765
four Mississippi, five Mississippi.
Done.

234
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,844
Done.Done.

235
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,282
- Qkay.
<i>_</i> Qkay, bye-

236
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,409
Oh, my God, I can't
believe I just did that!

237
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,131
- Gosh, why am I embarrassed?
- Did you get it?

238
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,807
Yeah, it was a miniseries,
I got all six episodes.

239
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,084
- Where did he go?
- I have no clue.

240
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,040
"Vee, $100 has been
wired to your account."

241
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,600
- Should I check?
- You should totally check.

242
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,328
<i>Every time I look
into your lovely eyes</i>

243
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,886
- What is he doing?
- I have no clue.

244
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,603
<i>I see a love
that money just can't buy</i>

245
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,047
<i>One look from you</i>

246
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,005
<i>I drift away</i>

247
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,127
<i>And I praY</i>

248
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,488
- He's singing to me.
- No, it's a dare, it's a dare.

249
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,201
<i>Are here to stay</i>

250
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,564
<i>Anything you want
you've got it</i>

251
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,690
<i>Anything you need
you've got it</i>

252
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,446
<i>Anything at all you got it</i>

253
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,924
<i>Baby, you got it</i>

254
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,724
- Thank you.
- Good job.

255
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,451
You won your dare, congratulations.

256
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,601
Back at ya.

257
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,402
Mine was totally embarrassing,
but at least I got 100 bucks, right?

258
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,682
I'm sorry, I promise
I didn't know what was comin'.

259
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,364
- Do you mind?
- Sorry, I'm sitting here.

260
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,091
They just told me to
sit in that booth and-- Sorry.

261
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,242
Some kid came by
and gave me that book.

262
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,482
<i>To the Lighthouse, yeah, my favorite.</i>

263
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,562
Exactly because it's
on your Facebook page.

264
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,564
They know all the
information about you, Vee.

265
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,608
Your name's Vee?

266
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,763
- Short for Venus.
- I like that.

267
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,322
Her parents, they named her
after the Goddess of Love.

268
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,164
There's a Roman myth.

269
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,881
Yeah, I guess my mom was
expecting somebody else.

270
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,169
I dunno about that.
That was some kiss.

271
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,324
I got a game to play
but good night to you guys.

272
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,811
Thank you.

273
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,681
What?

274
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,402
Apparently the Watchers
like us together.

275
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,244
I mean, you can't even
go to the city, right?

276
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,970
You know, I can't go to the city, yeah.

277
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,129
I'm not even playing,
I was just doing one dare.

278
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,285
- Are you sure? It's 200 bucks.
- She's pretty sure, man.

279
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,004
He always tell you what to do?

280
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,242
No, no, he doesn't.

281
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,285
I'm gonna be outside
if you change your mind.

282
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,850
It's nice to meet you, Vee.

283
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,565
See ya, man.

284
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,722
He thought that
those were our fries.

285
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,041
- I could use 200 bucks.
- Vee, you're not going to the city.

286
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,650
You said one dare.

287
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,801
I'm sorry.

288
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,281
You know what,
Charles Manson was a singer.

289
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,282
I was hoping you'd come.

290
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,121
I'm just warning you, I don't think
I'd make a very good partner.

291
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,170
I'm not the daredevil type.

292
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,884
You should team up with
my friend Sydney actually.

293
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,042
She's obsessed
with playing Nerve.

294
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,611
But the Watchers want
me to team up with you.

295
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,731
The second I feel
uncomfortable, I'm out.

296
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,961
That's fair.

297
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,206
Okay.

298
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,446
Hold on.

299
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,722
<i>I just have to go to the bathroom.</i>

300
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,248
<i>Excuse me, ladies?</i>

301
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,321
Ladies?

302
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,649
<i>Hey, where are you going?
Please, let me fart on you, please!</i>

303
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,566
<i>- Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God'.
-Oh, my God.</i>

304
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,563
- It's going up so fast!
- I know.

305
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,802
Who's your favorite Player?

306
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:29,280
Well, I mean, I was gonna
say you, but now I don't know.

307
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,361
Is that Vee?

308
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,489
Yeah, she's playing and she
has, like, a lot of Watchers.

309
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,244
Oh, my God, girl!

310
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,243
- Hey, try screaming.
- No.

311
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,771
You can do it, let it out!

312
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,761
There you go.

313
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,124
Alright, this is it.

314
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,247
Am I supposed to come in with you?

315
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,727
Doesn't say anything about that.

316
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,686
Well, thank you for the lift.

317
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,244
You gonna be okay?

318
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,891
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm tired,

319
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,645
so I'm probably just gonna
make my way back home.

320
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,568
This is fun.

321
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,041
- Yeah.
- I just gotta... you know.

322
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,241
Okay.

323
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,930
You got three more steps.

324
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,164
If you keep up the exercises,
you're gonna get really strong on that.

325
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,810
Excellent.

326
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,686
Thanks, Miss.

327
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,806
Somebody's sending Vee money.

328
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,882
White people problems.

329
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,010
What is she doing?

330
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,042
And you have your receipt. So thank you
so much for shopping at BergdorFs.

331
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,124
- You have a wonderful day.
- Excuse me, sorry.

332
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,089
Do you know where
I can find this dress?

333
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,401
Your mom's calling.

334
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,926
Shit!

335
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,642
That's very expensive.

336
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,442
- Couture, fourth floor.
- Thanks.

337
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,011
Please, don't undress the mannequin.

338
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,846
- Sorry.
- Would you like to try this on?

339
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,047
Let me see
if I have it in your size.

340
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,167
Thank you.

341
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,210
If you could hurry up,
I'm a little bit late for a party.

342
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,520
Cute.

343
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,523
Okay, right this way.

344
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,651
If you need anything else,
just let me know.

345
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,604
- Okay, thank you.
- Oh, alright.

346
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,367
Okay, dressed.

347
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,081
Hello?

348
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,287
- Everything okay?
- Everything is great, thank you.

349
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,291
Hey, what's your email number?

350
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,489
I mean your... What's your info?

351
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,850
Oh, this, this old thing?

352
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,126
Vee!

353
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,727
H6)'-

354
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,370
Hi.

355
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,568
You look very pretty.

356
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,284
Thanks, so do you.

357
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,886
I mean you look, you know,
hot, or handsome or...

358
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,488
Do you know what we're
supposed to do now?

359
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:41,886
The Watchers would like me
to complete your ensemble, mademoiselle.

360
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,806
<i>Neither, is that an option?</i>

361
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,322
Alright, how 'bout my
firstborn son, too?

362
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,246
What are you doing, Vee?

363
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,325
- <i>How much are they, sir?</i>
- <i>That'll be $900, madam.</i>

364
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,607
<i>In that case I'll take two.</i>

365
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,365
<i>One for the city
and one for the Hamptons.</i>

366
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,124
Excellent choice, mademoiselle.

367
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,283
I'll wrap them up
for you right away.

368
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,805
I'll see ya downstairs?

369
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,042
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay, alright.

370
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,121
What?

371
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,041
Excuse me, Miss, did you
move my clothes in there?

372
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,491
Of course not.

373
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,006
This is not happening.

374
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,571
Vee? Vee?

375
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,290
- Ian.
- Hey.

376
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,646
Did you take my stuff?

377
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,324
I mean, my wallet,
my clothes, everything's gone.

378
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,449
No, my stuff is gone, too.

379
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,811
- No.
- Okay...

380
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,609
- No, no.
- Come on, we have to make a run for it.

381
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,444
- Come on, let's go.
- I am not shoplifting!

382
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,364
We don't have a choice, come on!

383
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,521
Okay, technically, it just says
we have to leave the store.

384
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,161
Right?

385
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,881
Let's go.

386
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,367
Come on, come on, let's go!

387
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,371
Sorry, buddy, we need
to come through, sorry.

388
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,604
Excuse me, excuse me!

389
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,366
Let's go, come on, come on.

390
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,125
Whoa, whoa, hey, stop, stop, stop!

391
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,568
Please, tell me
these are our clothes!

392
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,365
- They kind of are.
- Are these stolen?

393
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,966
Receipt.

394
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,805
- <i>We get to keep 'em?</i>
- <i>All yours.</i>

395
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,046
Hey, can I get the check?

396
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,889
Who paid for these?

397
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,486
Probably, one of the Watchers
with daddy's credit card.

398
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,164
- What?
- Look!

399
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,321
<i>Dolla dolla bill, y'all!</i>

400
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,562
I'm sorry, was that
a Wu-Tang reference?

401
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,967
- Staten Island, represent!
- Okay.

402
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,162
Saint Mark's, ten minutes?

403
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,647
Hello.

404
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,290
Tommy, what
does Vee think she's doing?

405
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,805
Have you ever
parked a car in your life?

406
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,201
I got this, girl.

407
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,566
<i>I have no idea, Syd.</i>

408
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,529
Why are you asking me,
I'm not her boyfriend.

409
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,523
<i>Well, who's this
biker she's teamed up with?</i>

410
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,046
<i>I have no clue,
she just ditched me.</i>

411
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,726
She's doing what she apparently
thinks is best for herself.

412
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,245
Yeah, and what exactly is that?

413
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,166
Sydney, Syd, Vee is in the top 10.

414
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,402
- What?
- She's in the top 10.

415
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,045
Tommy, Vee is in the top 10?

416
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,770
- Yeah, I know.
- <i>How is that even possible?</i>

417
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,164
- How many Watchers does she have?
- Like 4,471.

418
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,724
- How many do I have?
- 6,806.

419
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,326
Oh, okay, I have a lot more.

420
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,091
<i>Tommy, I really don't think
that Vee can handle this.</i>

421
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,640
- <i>I'm actually really worried about her.</i>
- <i>Yeah, me</i> too.

422
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,041
<i>So get your ass to
this party and help me, okay?</i>

423
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,407
Yeah, yeah, I'm on my way.

424
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,685
What happens if I bail?

425
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,445
You lose everything
you've already made.

426
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,443
My morn would kill me.

427
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,050
What do you want to do?

428
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,369
Okay, just please no
fire breathing dragons or knives,

429
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,808
no clowns, no snakes, no skeletons.

430
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,685
What about panthers and tornadoes?

431
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,962
- No. No.
- No? Okay.

432
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,965
Whoa, what about this?
Just a tattoo of my dad.

433
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,850
He's gorgeous, honestly,
he's a nice looking guy.

434
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,561
Okay, I got a better idea, here we go.

435
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,809
You're gonna draw it, no!

436
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,850
Be quiet, I gotta concentrate.
Back off.

437
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,961
Okay.

438
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,489
Can you do something like
this but less shitty?

439
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,086
- Yes!
- Yeah?

440
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,123
Right, I'm laughing
'cause it's good.

441
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,565
You guys, come on.

442
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,041
You have to trust us,
that's the whole thing.

443
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,326
Gotta trust me.

444
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,448
And dirt beard.

445
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,890
<i>Okay, ORGY-</i>

446
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,210
<i>Okay, you can stop.</i>

447
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,163
<i>You can stop,
I think we're good, we're good.</i>

448
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,242
<i>The dare said it just had
to be bigger than a quarter.</i>

449
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,721
<i>This definitely feels
bigger than a quarter.</i>

450
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,529
You're doing great, it's almost done.

451
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,602
Okay, no, I think wherever
we're at it, we can stop.

452
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,286
Hold on, I'm just
doing the "Y" in daddy.

453
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,922
- What?
- He's kidding, don't listen to him.

454
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,201
I really don't like that noise at all.

455
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,884
Oh, my God.

456
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,162
- Rocking that gold tooth.
- I forget the rest.

457
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,045
Okay, Okay. Ow!

458
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,723
Wu-Tang fan, huh?

459
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,484
My brother used to listen
to them all the time.

460
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,642
Oh, yeah, you have a brother?

461
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,245
I had a brother.

462
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,641
He died right before
starting college.

463
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,210
I'm sorry.

464
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,044
How long ago was that?

465
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,602
Two years ago, he was 18.

466
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,683
This July, I'll be older than him.

467
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,411
Older than my older brother.

468
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,280
Hey, hey, come on.
Stay with me, stay with me.

469
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,564
He was just one of those people
that wasn't afraid of anything.

470
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,881
He always said yes.

471
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,284
He would laugh so hard if he saw me
getting a tattoo right now.

472
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,169
Boom, I'm done! Go to that mirror
and you celebrate my work.

473
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,844
- Come on, let's go.
- Do I want to see it?

474
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,365
Yes, yes, yes.

475
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,569
- <i>Hey.</i>
- <i>What's up, young Jedi?</i>

476
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,166
- Yeah, hi, hey.
- We miss you down here at the club.

477
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,244
- You're watching Nerve, right?
- Yeah, man, we all are.

478
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,971
Alright, I'm trying to find
out more about this Ian guy.

479
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,283
Ian, my dude, he playing with your
little girlfriend, Vee, right?

480
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,566
Could be you but you ain't playing.

481
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,205
Alright, yes, that's the problem though

482
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,682
but I'm looking on his profile
and there's just nothing on the guy.

483
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,810
- Well, did you try Google?
- Yeah, I tried Google.

484
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,247
I guess he's a ghost then.

485
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,244
Look, I need to take it to Aruba.

486
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,491
- What, no.
- Yes, <i>come</i> on.

487
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,289
<i>No way, you're
not ready for that shit.</i>

488
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,566
- <i>Yes,</i> I know.
- <i>You're gonna mess up my rating.</i>

489
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,687
I'm not gonna mess up your rating.

490
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,489
I'm not gonna buy
guns or something, man.

491
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,324
<i>Tommy no, not happening.</i>

492
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,246
Look, I'm just worried
about my friend, please.

493
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,210
- Come on.
- Alright, I'll send you a pass key.

494
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,567
Alright, thank you.

495
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,522
A lighthouse?
I love it, thank you.

496
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:39,491
Well, a very wise person once said,
and this was earlier today,

497
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,490
they said that the lighthouse represents
the thing that you want the most.

498
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,167
So, whatever that is,
I hope you get it.

499
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,567
<i>How many followers
does she have now?</i>

500
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,883
I mean, to be fair,
you did tell her to take a risk.

501
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,281
This isn't what I meant, Liv.

502
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,290
This is ridiculous.

503
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,089
Sydney.

504
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,762
<i>Okay, now they're
asking if! can trust you. Can I?</i>

505
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,401
<i>I have the perfect
tattoo picked out for you.</i>

506
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,084
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

507
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,563
- <i>No, okay, it's not</i> a <i>tattoo dare.</i>
- <i>What is it?</i>

508
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,644
<i>Just says go to Park and 25th.</i>

509
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,563
Oh, God, I love the internet.

510
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,331
What?

511
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,446
What?

512
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,567
<i>Ian's played before?</i>

513
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,608
- <i>You don't have to do this.</i>
- <i>I can do this.</i>

514
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,763
- <i>You don't have to do this.</i>
- <i>I can do this.</i>

515
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,251
<i>Hey, it's Vee, I'm not
here right now. So, leave a mess--</i>

516
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,965
Here we go.

517
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,728
Get to 60 miles per hour.

518
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,207
- That's it.
- Okay.

519
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,406
Alright?

520
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,285
Easy one, alright, let's do this.

521
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,042
What did that just say?

522
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,280
Blindfolded?
On the motorcycle.

523
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,646
Yeah?

524
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,486
- You're on your own with that one.
- Wait, I can't do this alone.

525
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,369
Come on, I need you
to help me navigate.

526
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,171
There's no way in hell I'm doing that.

527
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,046
I'm sorry, I'm out.

528
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,691
Thank you for tonight.

529
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,724
I had a lot of fun, got a new dress...

530
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,727
But... I'm good.

531
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,084
Stay, let's see what else happens.

532
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,529
Yo, what's up guys?

533
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,324
Veenus, I love your wardrobe.

534
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,404
Could you hold that for me?
Hold it, hold it up.

535
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,881
Great.

536
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,569
Hey, Ian, see you in the finals.

537
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,769
Who was that guy?

538
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,764
I don't know, just another player.

539
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,844
Vee come on, do this with me.
Please, I need you.

540
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,482
Look, you'd be in control.

541
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,283
Say, yes, just say yes.

542
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,527
<i>You got next?
Who wants to challenge the champ?</i>

543
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,125
<i>Liv.</i>

544
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,322
- No way.
- Hey, Liv, come on.

545
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,285
Sydney.

546
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,524
- Sydney.
- What?

547
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,171
Oh, my God, you're
not gonna believe this.

548
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,449
What? Are you kidding me?

549
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,643
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

550
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,888
Now remember, you're my eyes.

551
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,247
Okay... Green.

552
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,651
Hold on.

553
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,486
- You okay?
- Yeah.

554
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,449
- Just keep your eyes open.
- Okay, okay, okay.

555
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,568
Hey, I know you're scared
but you gotta talk to me, Vee.

556
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,290
Okay, wait, no, no, no.

557
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,931
We got this, Vee.
What's going on, what's going on?

558
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,765
- Are we good, are we good?
- Taxi to the right, right, right.

559
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,649
- You've a sticker on your helmet.
- Thank you.

560
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,643
Okay, you're leaning to the left...

561
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,002
- Are you crazy?
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

562
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,448
Okay, too far left,
right, right, right.

563
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,646
Okay, I think that worked, yeah?
Are we good?

564
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,769
- Actually, yes.
- Okay, keep doing that.

565
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:56,927
Just lean?

566
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,607
Yeah, lean left or right,
you are in control.

567
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,681
That's good.

568
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,884
No way she's doing this.

569
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,645
- This is good, you're doing great.
- Okay, speed up.

570
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,960
Yes, ma'am.

571
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,165
Okay, 30, we're halfway there.

572
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,960
Okay, the next light is green.

573
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,320
- The next light's green.
- Good, good, I got this.

574
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,528
Okay, next light is...

575
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,005
Come on, stay with me, what's going on?

576
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,491
Next light is green, faster.

577
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,722
No,no,no,no,no.

578
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,686
Green.

579
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,684
- We're doing this Vee.
- Sixty seconds.

580
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,081
- Are we clear now?
- Still clear.

581
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,922
Taxi, taxi.

582
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,003
Take it home, Vee,
take it home, Vee.

583
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,889
- Time check!
- Fifteen seconds!

584
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,329
- Speed.
- Forty-six, 47.

585
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,889
Hey, guys, we love you.

586
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,440
- Love you too.
- Let's go.

587
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:44,205
Fifty-seven, 58, 59, 60!

588
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,725
We did it!

589
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,723
- Oh, shit!
- Look out!

590
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,928
- Hold on!
- Oh, my God!

591
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,885
Vee's number one.

592
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,849
Oh, my God.

593
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,809
That was the craziest
thing I've ever done!

594
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,851
- You were incredible, I wanna like...
- I can't even believe we did that.

595
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,288
Oh, Vee, get it girl.

596
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,725
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

597
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,284
Are you hungry at all?

598
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,251
- Pizza?
- Pizza, I swear I was gonna say pizza.

599
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,851
<i>Hey, Watchers. Okay, listen.</i>

600
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,888
<i>You and I both know that
I should be in that box,</i>

601
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,281
<i>so please stop
holding back, okay?</i>

602
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,361
<i>You guys don't need to be afraid</i>

603
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,131
<i>because I'm not afraid,
so just give me a real dare.</i>

604
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,409
- What's up, Syd, baby?
- What are you doing here?

605
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,643
You're a good Player.

606
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,444
You've got a lot of Watchers,
I got a lot of Watchers.

607
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,408
Maybe we could team up.

608
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,487
I don't need a partner.

609
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,564
Seems to work for your friend Vee.

610
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,883
- What up, Syd, you alright?
- Yeah, we're just talking.

611
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,884
Yo, Mad Max, why don't
you show yourself out, man?

612
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,126
Call me.

613
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,366
Break down.

614
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,647
Captain.

615
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,050
Party on, man!

616
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,241
Hey, Nancy.

617
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,881
<i>Tommy, listen, I have a quick question.
How would I know if I'm being hacked?</i>

618
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,724
- <i>What do you mean?</i>
- <i>Hacked.</i>

619
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,282
<i>Somebody's been depositing
money into my account under Vee's name.</i>

620
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,408
That doesn't sound like a hack.

621
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:39,087
Normally, they would take money out,
if they were hacking you.

622
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,891
Thomas, what are you not telling me?

623
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,487
Oh, it must...
It might be Vee got a job.

624
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,564
- What, <i>a job?</i>
- Yeah, that's probably it.

625
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,325
- <i>She did an online poker thing.</i>
- Okay.

626
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,890
<i>And she's really great at it.</i>

627
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,200
- Is it legal?
- Yeah, it's <i>legal</i>

628
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,966
and she's doing great,
as you can tell with the deposits

629
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:03,809
but anyway, I gotta go, I'm writing
a paper right now on motorcycle safety.

630
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,609
- <i>I'm</i> gonna <i>get</i> going but--
- <i>Well, tell her to call me.</i>

631
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,967
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

632
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,763
Wanna take a ride?

633
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:18,011
- Is this a dare?
- It's a carousel.

634
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,684
So, why are you playing Nerve?

635
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,411
Trying to help out my family.

636
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,644
Some things happened that
I wish turned out differently.

637
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,481
Like What?

638
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:42,251
This is just kind of
something I need to do, so...

639
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,730
We got some paparazzi. Hide.

640
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,530
What, who is it?

641
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,806
So, that's Sydney.
Are you going to get it?

642
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,848
<i>I don't want to deal with her right now.</i>

643
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,570
Ouch.

644
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,484
What's going on?

645
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,609
She's just been odd
recently, but, whatever,

646
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,682
you don't wanna talk about that.

647
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,967
If you want to talk about it I'm here.
I'm happy to listen.

648
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,200
I'm just tired of being
her sidekick all the time.

649
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:34,365
That's funny, you don't seem
like anyone's sidekick.

650
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,888
Could I see that picture again?

651
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,680
Sure.

652
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,328
- Wow.
- Yeah, guys go crazy for her.

653
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:54,484
No, I mean, the picture itself,
it's really good.

654
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,124
- Thanks, I took it.
- Yeah? You have a good eye.

655
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,568
I just, I can't picture you hanging out
with someone like this.

656
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,727
What do you mean?

657
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,691
I don't know,
she looks kind of insecure.

658
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,048
- Is that mean?
- She is, totally insecure.

659
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:16,967
I mean, she makes it seem like I'm the
one who's insecure but really it's her.

660
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,566
- It's exhausting.
- I'm sure.

661
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:24,646
<i>She's at this party, most likely drunk,
and needs me to hold her hair back.</i>

662
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,042
<i>I'm just over it.
I mean, so are her parents.</i>

663
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:32,808
<i>They're constantly out of town, so she
has this revolving door of guys over.</i>

664
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,888
It's sad actually.

665
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,965
Hey, that party.

666
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,482
Should we maybe go check it out?

667
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,245
What?
Why would I want to go to that party?

668
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,170
Maybe... show off your new tattoo?

669
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,764
Show Sydney that you're not
the person she thinks you are?

670
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,526
Hey, watch out.

671
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:11,368
Okay, okay, I got this, okay.

672
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,207
Go, Sydney.

673
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,566
Come on, Syd,
you're better than this.

674
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,722
- Come on, just turn around.
- Come on, Syd, you got this.

675
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,929
Come on Syd, you started it,
you got to finish it.

676
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,049
Come on, you got it, you got it.

677
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,931
Sydney, deep breath.

678
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,923
- Just take a deep breath, Sydney.
- It's alright.

679
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,362
Get in here, she's gonna do it.

680
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,044
- I got this, okay.
- There you go, come on.

681
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,407
There you go, there you go.

682
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,049
Come on Syd, you got this.

683
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,964
Liv, Liv, Liv, come, come, come.

684
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:56,045
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Oh, my God. Sydney.

685
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,566
- Be careful, be careful, Syd.
- What are you doing?

686
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,085
Oh, my God.

687
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,731
You don't have to do this, come back.

688
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,847
Shut up.

689
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,082
Sydney, come back.

690
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,604
<i>Come on, yeah, there you go.</i>

691
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,242
- You don't have to do this.
- Take your time, Syd, don't look down.

692
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,129
This is a stupid game.

693
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,249
Come on, we're right here.
You can always turn back, Syd.

694
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,481
Come on, come on, you got to film.

695
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,767
Sydney, it's not gonna
count unless you film it.

696
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,410
Don't worry about the phone.

697
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,244
She has to film it, she can't--

698
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,482
It doesn't count unless she
films it, she has to film it.

699
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,409
- Just bail and come back.
- She has to film it.

700
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,847
- No, but she has to film it.
- Shut up, Chuck.

701
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,921
Oh, my God.

702
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,443
I can't, 0h, my God,
I can't, I can't.

703
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,762
Sydney, you got to get up,
you gotta do something.

704
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,127
Stop yelling at me, stop.

705
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,289
She has to get it done.

706
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,203
Shut up.

707
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,406
This is gonna take too long.

708
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,201
You got to stand, you got to walk.

709
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,725
Shut up!

710
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,290
Shut up, Chuck.

711
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,081
You heard her, Chuck shut up.

712
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,925
She's gotta get it done.

713
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,369
She's not gonna get here in time
unless she gets up and walks.

714
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,005
She has to, she's wasting time.

715
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,923
Shut up both of you.

716
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,844
Come on Syd, you got this.

717
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,084
I can't, I can't, I can't.
I bail, I bail, I bail.

718
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,404
<i>You bail.</i>

719
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,881
- <i>You fail.</i>
- <i>Someone help him out of there.</i>

720
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,649
<i>You fail.</i>

721
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,605
<i>This is so dumb.</i>

722
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,362
- <i>Hey, come here, hold on.</i>
- <i>You fail.</i>

723
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,044
<i>What are you doing, get over here.</i>

724
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,406
Vee.

725
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:25,643
Hi, oh, my gosh, you guys
are so famous right now.

726
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,563
Oh, wait till Syd sees you.

727
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,530
- Where is she?
- Oh, you guys don't know?

728
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:35,201
Yeah, she tried to
walk across that ladder and just bailed.

729
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,884
- Is she out of the game?
- Yeah, let's get a drink.

730
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,042
Yeah, it wasn't pretty.

731
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,601
- Have you seen Sydney?
- Yeah.

732
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:48,681
Syd.

733
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:59,844
Oh, come on, Vee,
you never even spoke to him.

734
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,129
It's fine, certainly no surprise.

735
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,326
Sorry.

736
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,280
Yeah, I know it's not a surprise.
You know what's not fine though.

737
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:13,285
I almost died tonight, Vee,
and you were nowhere to be found.

738
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,840
I'm sorry, when you said
I should live my life,

739
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,321
did you mean I should live
my life in your shadow?

740
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,561
I was just trying to help you, Vee,

741
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,610
because you're the most
repressed person that I know.

742
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,206
Wasn't that why you keep me around?
Because I never tell you the truth?

743
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,044
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's go.

744
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,646
I guess you don't tell me the truth.

745
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,883
Because you never told me
about how insecure I am.

746
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,009
Or about how I just have
a revolving door of guys all the time.

747
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:42,050
You never tell me that
but you've told everyone that tonight.

748
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,249
So please, Vee, go right
ahead and show us all

749
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:48,164
what a fiery little spark
plug you've become since lunch.

750
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,490
Let's go.

751
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,085
Shots fired.

752
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,242
Don't walk away from me, Vee.

753
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,448
Wake up, this is a game.

754
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,851
<i>Do you really think
that someone like him</i>

755
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,570
<i>is actually gonna be with you
when this is all done?</i>

756
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,641
Wait, you don't know me.

757
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,569
Oh, I'm sorry,
you really like her now?

758
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:03,880
Yeah, I do.

759
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,041
<i>Alright, come on Syd,
you're just drunk.</i>

760
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,202
<i>Tommy, it is time to get over her.</i>

761
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,408
Clearly she has traded up.

762
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,006
Why do you have to be such a bitch?

763
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:16,642
Look at that, little Vee
finally speaking her mind.

764
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,961
<i>Come on, unburden yourself.</i>

765
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:24,444
You know why we're best friends?
I do whatever you want all the time.

766
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,931
<i>No, Vee.</i>

767
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,450
<i>We're friends because
I'm fun and you're boring.</i>

768
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:35,646
The only fun thing about
you was your brother.

769
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,086
What is it you think?

770
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,004
That playing Nerve is just gonna
magically make you a different person?

771
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:44,641
That's not how life works,
you'll never be a player.

772
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,728
Right, right.

773
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,451
I know how much you love
living in the moment, Syd.

774
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,888
Well remember this
moment because you're one of those girls

775
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,564
who peaks in high school.

776
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,450
And you wake up one day still
living in Staten Island,

777
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,965
still screwing the same guys,

778
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,168
wondering what the hell
happened to your life.

779
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,720
If you want to know
where I am from now on,

780
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,564
sign up and watch me.

781
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,008
Wait, Vee, what are you doing?

782
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,210
Hey, hey, Vee,
you don't need to do this.

783
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,248
Look at me, come on, let's just go.
Let's bail, alright?

784
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,560
What do you have to prove?

785
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,405
Come on, please, let's go.

786
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,167
You got it, Vee, please.

787
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,083
Go, girl!

788
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,570
Oh, my God, Vee.

789
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,529
Whoa!

790
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,086
That'll take you into first, Vee!

791
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,481
That was messed up.

792
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:22,971
I can't deal with this
right now, I'm gonna go.

793
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,486
Vee, do you know that
he's played Nerve before?

794
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:26,686
What?

795
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,762
Yeah, it was his dare to get
you here and fight with Syd.

796
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,569
That's why he brought you here.

797
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,971
Look.

798
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,969
Do you still trust him?

799
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,565
Vee, wait, wait.

800
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:46,086
- Is it true?
- Is what true?

801
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,004
Did you take me here
as part of the game?

802
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,363
Answer me, is it true?

803
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:01,608
- What are you doing?
- It's more complicated than that.

804
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,603
I just lost my
two best friends tonight.

805
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,250
- I know.
- How much did you get for that?

806
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,441
No, no, it's not about
the money, alright?

807
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:08,488
But I promise,
I'll explain to you later.

808
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,927
Just don't even bother, okay?
I mean, Sydney almost died tonight.

809
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,526
- I almost died tonight.
- Vee, I know, I know.

810
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,921
This game is sick,
I'm going to the police.

811
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,604
Wait, no, no, no.

812
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,444
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?

813
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,522
I'm sorry, you can't do that, alright?
You can't go to the police.

814
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,921
Why not?
Because I'll lose the game?

815
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,209
No, it's not about that.
Vee, Vee.

816
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,210
You can't go to the police.
It's the last thing you wanna do.

817
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,682
Vee, wait, I wasn't trying to hurt you.
It just got out of control.

818
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,206
Move, just get out of my way.

819
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:40,767
Officer!

820
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:48,683
Officer, officer, I need help. I'm
playing this game, it's called Nerve.

821
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,650
And I'm worried that someone's
gonna get really hurt.

822
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:54,087
Snitch.

823
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,568
- That game, are they playing too?
- Yeah.

824
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,324
Dude, get out of this.

825
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,363
Is there a crime being committed?

826
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,809
No, but a kid could die tonight.

827
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,287
Look, here, it's all on
my phone, you can see.

828
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,209
What? What?

829
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,331
Snitch! Snitch!

830
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,403
- <i>Mom?</i>
- <i>Honey, what's going on?</i>

831
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:36,405
- Mom!
- Vee, where are <i>you?</i>

832
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,484
All the money is missing
from our account!

833
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,291
- Wait, what?
- Vee, honey, are you in trouble?

834
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,966
<i>Can you just please
tell me what's going on?</i>

835
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,646
Okay, Mom, I'm gonna
fix this I promise.

836
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,361
<i>Fix what?</i>

837
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,887
Hello?
Vee, hello, Vee?

838
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,851
I'm sorry but I
got to win this game.

839
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,649
<i>Hello, Vee.</i>

840
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:01,441
<i>You broke the rules,
you are our prisoner.</i>

841
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,682
<i>We told you not to snitch.</i>

842
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,406
<i>Now we control your life.</i>

843
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:10,131
<i>We control your family.</i>

844
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,089
<i>We control your future.</i>

845
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:17,160
<i>The only way out is to
win the final round.</i>

846
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:20,801
<i>Go to the Staten Island ferry
and the Watchers will find you.</i>

847
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,646
<i>See you in the finals,
see you in the finals...</i>

848
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,441
I'm coming for you, Vee!

849
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:28,045
- Vee, thank God, are you okay?
- Am I okay? No, I'm not okay.

850
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,645
You need to tell me everything.

851
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,563
- Okay, what the hell is going on?
- Come here, come here.

852
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,404
Why is this happening to me?

853
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:38,770
That guy, Ty, we both played
Nerve last year in Seattle.

854
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:42,367
We got a dare to hang from a
construction crane, 200 feet in the air.

855
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:45,205
The two of us
and this kid named Robby.

856
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:46,725
Five, four, three

857
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,040
Come on, Robby, that's enough.

858
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,121
- Got it?
- Shit, he's slipping.

859
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,406
Two, one.

860
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:53,569
Come on, grab my
hand, man, grab my hand.

861
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:56,962
Ty and I, we bailed
and we went to the cops.

862
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,850
We tried to get the game shut down
but they didn't do anything.

863
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,082
No, they just called it an accident.

864
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:07,486
Then, the Watchers
came after us for snitching.

865
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,121
But they messed with my dad's job,
they leaked photos of my sister online,

866
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,568
they stole our identities, Vee.

867
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,450
Me and Ty, we became
prisoners of the game.

868
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,010
Oh, come on, what
does that even mean?

869
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,765
It's the third category.

870
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:24,002
Watcher, Player, Prisoner.

871
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:29,611
I'm trapped.
The only way out is to win.

872
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:38,765
- So, you have to win.
- No... No, you do.

873
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:42,721
- What?
- Vee, you're a Prisoner now.

874
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:46,088
Okay, you and I, we're going to the
final round together and I'm gonna lose.

875
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:49,010
- What, no, you can't do that.
- It's already done, it's already done.

876
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,167
I told the Watchers to give me a dare

877
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,527
that's gonna knock Ty
out of second place.

878
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,284
It's gonna be me and you.

879
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,529
- I have to go.
- No, no, no.

880
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,011
Okay, I wanna take you
somewhere safe, let's go.

881
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,605
There has to be another way.

882
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:04,881
There isn't.

883
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:11,082
If it's not me in the finals, then
it's Ty and he'll do anything to win.

884
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,565
Just tell me we're gonna do this.

885
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:40,284
Hey, it's not your fault.

886
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,448
I just hope she's okay.

887
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,170
- Hello?
- Guys, it's me.

888
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,925
Oh, my God, Vee, where are you?

889
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,486
I'm so sorry.

890
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:25,891
It doesn't matter,
I'm just glad you're okay.

891
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,201
- Alright, guys, come on, let's go.
- I can't.

892
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:29,770
What?

893
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,251
I have to finish this.

894
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,446
Are you insane?

895
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,249
Vee, what are you talking about?

896
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:37,164
It's never gonna end, I mean,
even if they live me alone,

897
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,571
they're just gonna do
it to somebody else.

898
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,325
We can't stop the game if we wanted to.
There's no one to stop.

899
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,886
It's just a bunch of anonymous people.

900
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:48,165
What if they weren't anonymous?

901
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,565
<i>Ian's doing a dare that
will put him to the final,</i>

902
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,290
<i>so it could be me against him.</i>

903
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,124
Vee, do you actually trust this guy?

904
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,806
He's the person who got you
into this mess in the first place.

905
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,842
I got me into this mess.

906
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:09,481
Anything Ian's doing now
is to help me get out.

907
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,803
I know it sounds
crazy but I can do it.

908
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,723
I just need your help.

909
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,767
What do you need us to do?

910
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,366
Tommy, you said the game
is open source, right?

911
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,249
<i>Do you think you
can change the code?</i>

912
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,049
<i>It's gonna take time.</i>

913
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:36,686
<i>Syd, could you buy us some?</i>

914
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,721
Hey, now climb the cranes.

915
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,930
Syd.

916
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,480
- Yeah?
- Use a pay phone.

917
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:37,920
<i>Hang for five seconds.</i>

918
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:56,043
<i>Hang with one hand,
hang with one hand.</i>

919
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,685
Shit.

920
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:19,163
One, two, three...

921
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:22,244
...four, five!

922
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,529
<i>It's over here, Tommy.
You don't have a lot of time.</i>

923
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,888
Okay, yeah, we're on our way,
we'll see you soon. How did it go?

924
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:56,008
- It went.
- It went?

925
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,082
Yeah, I think it's gonna work.

926
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:00,844
Yeah, better work.

927
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,530
What is this place?

928
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,644
Fastest Internet in New York City.

929
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,521
- Hey, Tommy!
- Hey, HK, we made it.

930
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,489
- Let's get this started, you ready?
- Is the botnet up and running?

931
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:55,007
Yeah, of course.
We just gotta enter it into the system.

932
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:58,084
Oh and this is
Sydney, obviously.

933
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:01,323
Hey, welcome to the cloud.
Sucks you got axed.

934
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:04,483
Alright, let's take this game down.

935
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,764
Okay, how's this gonna work?

936
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,002
It's like Wikipedia,
where anyone can edit the code

937
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:28,009
but the majority has to approve it.

938
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:30,282
And the botnet can outvote everyone.

939
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:34,524
Yo, I got a army of bots
here waitin' for orders.

940
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,642
- <i>Hey,</i> Nancy.
- <i>Where is Vee, what is this game?</i>

941
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,200
- Don't worry, <i>she's</i> okay.
- I want you to explain it to me.

942
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:42,361
I'm gonna give you an address.

943
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:46,650
Okay, if you meet me here,
I'll explain everything.

944
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,410
Ticket.

945
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,051
Better hurry up.

946
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,602
Guys, it's starting!

947
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:11,205
Vee, Vee, Vee, Vee.

948
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,770
<i>Players, stop!</i>

949
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,451
<i>Back up.</i>

950
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,167
<i>StOP</i> -

951
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:49,844
Alright, how many
bots do we got in?

952
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,447
Not enough yet,
but we are getting there.

953
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,962
<i>Players, show us your weapons.</i>

954
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,284
<i>First to shoot wins.</i>

955
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,322
<i>20 seconds on the clock.</i>

956
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,524
20 seconds?

957
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,681
HK, I need backup!

958
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,643
- <i>Begin.</i>
- <i>Do it.</i>

959
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,484
<i>Start by just raising your gun.
Just raise your gun slowly.</i>

960
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:36,125
Then shoot me in the shoulder,
I'll be fine.

961
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,328
What if I miss?
I don't know if I can do this.

962
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,482
Oh, come on,
just shut up and play the game!

963
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:46,688
Vee, you have to hurry, alright?

964
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,604
You have to do this,
this is the only way the game can end

965
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:51,887
and then you can walk away.

966
01:20:56,840 --> 01:21:03,530
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

967
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:08,446
I'm not doing this.

968
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:09,641
Vee, don't, you can't...

969
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,045
I'll do it!

970
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,281
Oh, shit.

971
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,761
They're onto us,
they're blockin' all of our foreign lPs.

972
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,683
Tommy, do something!

973
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,804
Did y'all miss me?

974
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,920
And I say we do that dare again.

975
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,684
<i>With someone who's
really ready to play.</i>

976
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:40,761
Yeah!

977
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:43,764
Don't do it, Ty,
it's not worth it, man.

978
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,366
Stop!
Whoa, whoa, back up.

979
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:48,684
You have lost your mind,
pretty boy, get back!

980
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,922
Is this what you really want?
For us to kill each other?

981
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,321
- Yeah!
- Of course that's what you want.

982
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,204
Kill 'em!

983
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,203
You think that takes nerve?

984
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:01,001
Why don't you take off your
masks and show yourselves, huh?

985
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:03,082
You, take off your mask.

986
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:05,083
Yeah, what's your name?

987
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:11,090
<i>It's easy for you to
be brave in a crowd.</i>

988
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:14,004
<i>Hiding behind your screen names.</i>

989
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,401
Don't you guys see
that you're all still responsible

990
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,927
for what happens tonight
even if you are just watching?

991
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,765
Oh, my God, are you really
believing this bullshit?

992
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:26,526
Play to win!

993
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:31,567
You guys really want one
of us to die, for a game?

994
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:34,883
Yes, yes!

995
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,051
Then shoot me.

996
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,561
I dare you.

997
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,171
Okay.

998
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,043
Who wants me to shoot her?

999
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:49,770
Vee, what are you doing?

1000
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,730
Who wants me to shoot her?

1001
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,768
- Tommy, where's Vee?
- Alright, calm down.

1002
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,365
What is this game,
I want answers.

1003
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:57,487
What are you doing?

1004
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,722
You better tell me right
now or I'm calling the cops.

1005
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,404
- No, no cops.
- No, Nancy, calm down.

1006
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,084
Do you want me to shoot her?

1007
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:05,731
- Shoot to kill, shoot to kill!
- Then vote "Yes."

1008
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:09,282
Vote "Yes" if you
want me to shoot her!

1009
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,966
- Don't say "Yes!", say "No!"
- You want me to shoot her?

1010
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,122
You want me to shoot her?

1011
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,641
Come on guys, "No!"

1012
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:21,766
Guys, vote "No"!

1013
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:25,447
You, vote "Yes", vote "Yes"!

1014
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,522
Let me know, vote "Yes"!

1015
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:52,525
Come on, let's have
a little bit of anarchy.

1016
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:56,446
Alright, we're getting around them.
The lPs are coming in faster now.

1017
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:57,806
Vee, we need to go, right now!

1018
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:59,086
Oh. my God!

1019
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:01,367
Okay, alright,
come on, guys, keep it going.

1020
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,485
Oh, my God, Vee.

1021
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,888
Vee, please, please.

1022
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,769
No,no,no.

1023
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,402
Look at me, Vee, please!

1024
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:30,881
Go.

1025
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,365
That's my real name.

1026
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:47,486
<i>No, wait, stop, stop!</i>

1027
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,846
My God!

1028
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,445
<i>It's okay, it's okay!</i>

1029
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,524
Stop, it's okay, I'm okay.
It's okay.

1030
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:55,721
Oh. my God!

1031
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:57,886
Sorry.

1032
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,803
You were in on this?

1033
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,884
It was her plan, man,
her friend Sydney called me.

1034
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:07,405
That's why I'm here.

1035
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:08,766
The gun, what?

1036
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,001
Blanks, bro.

1037
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:16,441
It's fake.

1038
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:19,881
Oh. my God!

1039
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:26,646
You scared me.

1040
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,161
We cool?

1041
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:33,240
Yeah, we're free.

1042
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:36,324
She's a badass, watch out for her.

1043
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,122
- <i>That's it, the last Player's out.</i>
- <i>Did we get it?</i>

1044
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:42,531
<i>They're out, think it's crashing!</i>

1045
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:46,810
- We got it?
- And Nerve is officially offline!

1046
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,848
We have gamed the game.

1047
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:52,481
You guys are the dumbest
smart kids I've ever met.

1048
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,683
- I'm so sorry.
- No no, I'm sorry.

1049
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:59,207
I'm sorry for bringing
you into all this.

1050
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:04,042
I just wish that we
could've met some other way.

1051
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,290
I don't.

1052
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,164
Oh, man!

1053
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:10,480
And you.

1054
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:13,085
What a rock star.

1055
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,448
Looks like I can get
all your money back.

1056
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:18,329
They don't call me
Hacker Kween for nothin'.

1057
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,562
- Really? Thanks.
- Yeah.

1058
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:36,244
- Crazy first date, huh?
- Is that what that was?

1059
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:43,368
By the way, my real name is Sam.

1060
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,082
Well, it's nice to meet you, Sam.

1061
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:54,602
It's nice to meet you, Vee.

1062
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:25,162
<i>Hey, Vee,
it's 28 degrees in New York!</i>
