1
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:07,107
- Thank you.
- Oh, pretty.

2
00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:12,046
- Are you expecting a letter?
- One never knows.

3
00:00:12,114 --> 00:00:15,083
But if I should get one,
the stamp would be worth saving.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,109
- I have Mrs. Hamilton in a moment, sir.
- Are you seeing her today?

5
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:21,747
- I hope to.
- May I come along? I'd like to meet her.

6
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:30,327
Hello, Mrs. Hamilton.
How are you?

7
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,597
I'm glad to hear it.
I'd like to see you today.

8
00:00:34,669 --> 00:00:37,194
This afternoon, if possible.

9
00:00:37,272 --> 00:00:39,570
Yes, it is.
It's very urgent.

10
00:00:41,143 --> 00:00:44,044
- That's too bad.
- That's terrible.

11
00:00:45,614 --> 00:00:47,639
You can?
That's splendid.

12
00:00:48,717 --> 00:00:51,083
Thank you so much.
I'll be there.

13
00:00:51,153 --> 00:00:54,748
5:00 this evening.
Thank you. Good-bye.

14
00:00:54,823 --> 00:00:57,917
You didn't make an appointment
for this afternoon, did you?

15
00:00:57,993 --> 00:01:01,588
- It was the only possible time.
- You can't do this to Reverend Miller.

16
00:01:01,663 --> 00:01:03,722
That rehearsal's being held
just for you.

17
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:07,565
They'll get along without me, and
there are other things more important.

18
00:01:07,636 --> 00:01:12,699
- He'll be delighted to see you.
- It isn't the same. You're his bishop.

19
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:14,708
I don't like going alone.

20

21
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:33,653
It's the big house
at the end of this street, Driver.

22
00:01:34,696 --> 00:01:37,290
Dudley, I take it that...

23
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:41,233
that you have the money for the taxi?

24
00:01:41,303 --> 00:01:44,534
No. What makes you think
I have money?

25
00:01:44,606 --> 00:01:48,098
I just thought that,
you being an ang...

26
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:49,973
Goodness!

27
00:01:51,046 --> 00:01:53,310
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

28
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:05,826
Thank you.

29
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:15,068
I may be in time to join you
before too long.

30
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:17,502
- Please try.
- I'll see you in front of the church...

31
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:18,766
in exactly one hour.

32
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,673
- Try.
- I will be there.

33
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:24,541
- Good.
- This is it, Driver.

34
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:48,934
- Good evening, Bishop Brougham.
- How are you, Stevens?

35
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:51,564
Mrs. Hamilton is
in the drawing room, sir.

36
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,574
Thank you.

37
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,484
Well, Bishop Brougham.

38
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,286
My dear Mrs. Hamilton,
I've come to tell you...

39
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:10,188
- You've come to apologize, I trust.
- Exactly.

40
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:13,227
Upon mature consideration,
my objections seem petty...

41
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:15,456
compared with your generous gesture.

42
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,693
- I'm very relieved. Sit down, Bishop.
- Thank you.

43
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:21,930
What hurt me most was to think
that my instinct had betrayed me...

44
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:24,767
in recommending you
for the position you now hold.

45
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,773
I am unceasingly grateful.

46
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:30,072
Now, in planning the cathedral
I'm taking it for granted...

47
00:03:30,145 --> 00:03:33,137
that the George B. Hamilton
Memorial Chapel shall be located...

48
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,375
Just where you specified, Mrs. Hamilton.

49
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,384
You don't feel
the effect will be lost...

50
00:03:37,452 --> 00:03:39,852
if the whole cathedral
was built in my husbanïs honor?

51
00:03:39,921 --> 00:03:43,516
I said that in the heat of a dispute.
What matters is that it be built.

52
00:03:43,592 --> 00:03:48,586
Good. I will not have his name
in some horrid little brass plaque.

53
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:51,757
No, it will be in marble
with large, gilded letters.

54
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,768
Now, the large window depicting
St. George and the dragon.

55
00:03:55,804 --> 00:04:00,104
I should like St. George's countenance
suggest my late husbanïs.

56
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:03,305
And the dragon?

57
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:07,712
Any dragon.
Let's get the blueprints.

58
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,941
Mrs. Hamilton, since we're now
in agreement...

59
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:13,920
would you mind if we postpone
the discussion of the details?

60
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:16,583
- Julia's waiting at St. Timothy's.
- Very well.

61
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:19,388
We can go over the plans
when we send for the funds.

62
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:22,225
Thank you. I'm glad we've settled
our differences.

63
00:04:27,636 --> 00:04:29,570
Is anything the matter?

64
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:31,572
It doesn't seem quite right.

65
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:35,971
Stevens!

66
00:04:36,044 --> 00:04:38,740
There's something wrong
about the bishop's chair.

67
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:43,340
Madame, it must be the new varnish.

68
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:45,409
The finisher should have warned us.

69
00:04:47,322 --> 00:04:50,348
- I hope I'm not harming the chair.
- Not at all.

70
00:04:50,425 --> 00:04:53,986
Call a furniture shop or a plumber.

71
00:04:54,062 --> 00:04:56,087
- Turpentine. Do something, Stevens.
- Yes, ma'am.

72
00:04:56,164 --> 00:04:59,429
- Oh, dear.
- I wonder...

73
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:01,594
Will you give it a little pull
at the back?

74
00:05:14,549 --> 00:05:15,880
Thank you.

75
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,350
"Benefit. Help Save St. Timothy's"

76
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,184
It's been a long time
since Henry's been here.

77
00:05:21,256 --> 00:05:23,486
I wish he had come.

78
00:05:23,558 --> 00:05:27,153
When he was here,
he was so close to people.

79
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:29,162
So loved by everybody.

80
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,425
How does it seem now?

81
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:34,730
That the cathedral has moved him away
from the people he loved?

82
00:05:37,472 --> 00:05:40,066
Reverend Miller will be disappointed
not to see him.

83
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:42,075
He doesn't have to be.

84
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,510
- Hello, Mr. Miller.
- So good of you to come, Mrs. Brougham.

85
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,346
I'm delighted to be here.

86
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:52,386
This is Mr. Dudley,
the bishop's new assistant.

87
00:05:52,454 --> 00:05:54,718
- A pleasure.
- Thank you.

88
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:58,384
The bishop will try to get here later.
Something important came up.

89
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,486
Oh. Of course, he's a busy man.

90
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:06,097
- This is Mrs. Duffy.
- I know her. How are you?

91
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,533
It's always an honor to have you here
at St. Timothy's.

92
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:10,798
Thank you. This is Mr. Dudley.

93
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:12,271
Mrs. Duffy is the organist.

94
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,798
I'm sure she plays enchantingly.
Hello, Mrs. Duffy.

95
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:18,505
I'm afraid some of our boys
are a little late.

96
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:23,208
We should begin but
I don't see how we can.

97
00:06:23,284 --> 00:06:25,411
It's quite embarrassing.

98
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:30,550
It is a little difficult to compete
with basketball and Christmas.

99
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,423
- They're all good boys at heart.
- I know.

100
00:06:33,495 --> 00:06:35,622
- They'll show up.
- I hope so.

101
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:39,233
- Hello, Bobby.
- Hello.

102
00:06:40,135 --> 00:06:42,626
- What do you sing?
- First soprano.

103
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:45,172
- Are you good?
- I don't know.

104
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,834
- How about giving a...
- Me alone?

105
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:51,208
- You've got George. Hello, George.
- Hello.

106
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,372
- What do you say?
- Okay.

107
00:06:54,716 --> 00:06:56,479
- Are you ready, Mrs. Duffy?
- Oh, yes.

108
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:57,984
Hit it.

109
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:03,847
O sing to God

110
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:07,122
Your hymns of gladness

111
00:07:07,195 --> 00:07:09,129
Ye loving hearts

112
00:07:09,197 --> 00:07:11,825
Your tribute make

113
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:17,361
Your Lord is born this happy day

114
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:22,808
Then pierce the sky
with songs of gladness

115
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:27,177
Disperse the chains
of gloom and sadness

116
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:29,876
The Lord is born

117
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:32,385
This happy day

118
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:34,387
O Sing to Him

119
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:37,481
Your hymns of gladness

120
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:40,653
O sing to God

121
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:43,697
Your hymns of gladness

122
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:48,293
Ye loving hearts your tribute make

123
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:50,837
Your Lord is born

124
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:53,999
This happy day

125
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:59,172
Then pierce the sky
with songs of gladness

126
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:03,775
Disperse the shades
of gloom and sadness

127
00:08:03,852 --> 00:08:06,218
Your Lord is born

128
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:08,881
This happy day

129
00:08:08,957 --> 00:08:10,982
O sing full out

130
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:14,620
Your hymns of gladness

131
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:17,392
O Word of God

132
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:20,434
For us incarnate

133
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,696
O Word of God

134
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,001
For us incarnate

135
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:30,568
By faith we hear Thine angels sing

136
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:39,876
- Their hymns
- Angels sing their hymns

137
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:43,481
Of praise to Thee their King

138
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:48,495
We join with them in adoration

139
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:58,104
We pour
We pour to Thee

140
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:01,972
Our supplication

141
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:04,637
That Thou wouldst

142
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:08,045
Grant us Lord

143
00:09:08,116 --> 00:09:14,021
Salvation

144
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,058
Boys, that was beautiful.

145
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:27,067
Really beautiful.

146
00:09:27,535 --> 00:09:32,165
You've all grown up so since
the bishop and I lived in this parish.

147
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,107
I hardly recognized any of you.

148
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:37,144
I'm so proud of you.

149
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:39,509
I know he will be to.

150
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,514
Thank you.

151
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,948
Mr. Miller, that was wonderful.

152
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:46,885
I can't thank you enough.

153
00:09:46,955 --> 00:09:50,914
- And you, Mr. Dudley.
- I'm sorry the bishop isn't here.

154
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,923
- Are you all right?
- Yes. Thank you.

155
00:09:57,732 --> 00:10:00,132
What is keeping Stevens?

156
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:02,135
Stevens, there you are.

157
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:06,196
I'm sorry but the furniture shop
is closed until after New Year's.

158
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:09,607
I can't find a plumber.
We're out of turpentine.

159
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:12,544
- This is preposterous.
- What about some witch hazel?

160
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:17,484
- May I use your telephone?
- Of course. It's over there.

161
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:18,985
Thank you.

162
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:34,860
Tilda, this is Bishop Brougham.

163
00:10:34,936 --> 00:10:38,303
Will you bring a pair of my trousers
over to Mrs. Hamilton's house?

164
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:44,576
What difference does it make?
Just bring me another pair of trousers.

165
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,909
Thank you.

166
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:50,314
I'm so sorry this has happened.

167
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:52,945
If only I could contact Julia or Dudley.

168
00:10:53,021 --> 00:10:55,114
Don't be nervous, Bishop.

169
00:10:56,858 --> 00:10:58,689
Have a chair.

170
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,694
Thank you, I have one.

171
00:11:08,536 --> 00:11:09,764
He isn't here.

172
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:13,068
Perhaps the meeting was
more important than he thought.

173
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:15,075
I suppose.

174
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:17,877
We'd better go home.

175
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,183
Dudley, it's strange thing.

176
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:25,185
What's strange?

177
00:11:25,253 --> 00:11:29,212
You make me feel as if everything
is going to be all right.

178
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,622
- It could be if...
- If what?

179
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:36,061
If people could only learn
to behave like human beings.

180
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:41,026
Hey, taxi.

181
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:49,607
Here's a cab.

182
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:53,880
Will you please wait, Sylvester?

183
00:11:53,948 --> 00:11:55,882
Sure, mister.

184
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,440
Sylvester?

185
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:07,661
Good evening. I'll be right with you.

186
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:11,027
This is one of
our most exclusive models.

187
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:13,499
It's lovely.
Simply ravishing!

188
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:15,365
So chic, so young.

189
00:12:15,436 --> 00:12:18,428
- It is sweet, isn't it?
- It's stunning.

190
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:22,442
Not everyone could wear such a daring
hat. It was made for madame.

191
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,621
How did you know
my name was Sylvester?

192
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:46,462
It's up there on your card.

193
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:52,064
Could you drive us
through the park, please?

194
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,767
That's out of your way.

195
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:56,537
Sylvester,
are you getting bored with us?

196
00:12:56,611 --> 00:13:00,274
Oh, no. I'll drive you
to Mexico City, if you want.

197
00:13:00,348 --> 00:13:01,781
Thank you.

198
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:06,052
I'm having so much fun.

199
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,216
- Are you?
- Yes.

200
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:11,850
- Are you really?
- I feel as if I'm doing something bad.

201
00:13:11,926 --> 00:13:13,791
- Why?
- I don't know.

202
00:13:14,896 --> 00:13:17,558
I seems wrong to have
so much fun but...

203
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:20,601
I can't figure out why.

204
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:24,126
You folks know
what's wrong with this country?

205
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:27,003
I've heard several versions
of that.

206
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:29,941
- Do you know?
- I think I do.

207
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:33,540
Too many people who don't know
where they're going...

208
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:36,208
and they want to get there too fast.

209
00:13:36,284 --> 00:13:39,651
Take you two.
I'd call you unusual.

210
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,553
Thank you. You're very perceptive.

211
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:46,684
You know your destination
but are in no hurry to get there.

212
00:13:46,761 --> 00:13:49,696
You want to enjoy
some scenery en route.

213
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:52,096
And you're not reluctant to spend
an extra four bits...

214
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,361
for a detour with Mother Nature.

215
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:56,801
Look where you're going!

216
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,074
Well, my goodness.

217
00:14:02,143 --> 00:14:04,976
Did you see the way
I missed that truck?

218
00:14:05,046 --> 00:14:08,709
- It was like a miracle.
- Yes, but don't overplay your hand.

219
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:23,297
Sylvester, pull up here.

220
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:24,661
We're going skating.

221
00:14:24,732 --> 00:14:27,292
We mustn't. It's late.
We couldn't.

222
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:30,360
- Do you think we could?
- Henry can wait a little longer.

223
00:14:30,438 --> 00:14:32,702
- Yeah.
- Sylvester, stop the car.

224
00:14:39,347 --> 00:14:41,281
- I am wicked.
- If you are, so am I.

225
00:14:41,349 --> 00:14:43,749
And that's impossible.
Can you skate?

226
00:14:43,818 --> 00:14:46,412
I used to but I'm too old now.

227
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:49,388
Put on some skates.
You'll find out how young you are.

228
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:12,670
I don't know about this.

229
00:15:31,966 --> 00:15:33,900
Relax. That's right.

230
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:48,548
Pretty hat.

231
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:23,239
- Why, Dudley!
- Now you.

232
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,444
- Oh, no. L...
- Come on.

233
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:37,327
- Dudley, this is heaven.
- You found the perfect word.

234
00:17:00,788 --> 00:17:02,881
Look what I'm doing!

235
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:07,589
You're a beautiful skater.
In fact, you're beautiful.

236
00:17:16,137 --> 00:17:18,435
Look at Sylvester!

237
00:17:22,777 --> 00:17:24,711
Now, Sylvester.

238
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:50,630
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

239
00:17:50,704 --> 00:17:52,968
Keep cool, Sylvester!

240
00:17:55,176 --> 00:17:57,110
Relax.

241
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:01,338
That's right. Come on.

242
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,815
Give me the other one.
That's it.

243
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:06,478
Relax. No, not collapse.

244
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,358
Hang on to me.

245
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:21,432
Don't leave me!

246
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,551
How am I doing, Dudley?

247
00:18:51,832 --> 00:18:53,766
Wait for me!

248
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,484
Thank you, Dudley.

249
00:19:44,552 --> 00:19:47,783
- How much do I owe you?
- Not a cent, my friend.

250
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:51,689
My pockets are bulging with the coins
of self-satisfaction.

251
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:53,920
- Know why?
- I'd love to know.

252
00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:58,192
Because you two have restored
my faith in human nature.

253
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:00,392
Good night, Dudley and Julia.

254
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:02,526
- Good night, Sylvester.
- Good night, Sylvester.

255
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:10,777
Sylvester is a noble soul.

256
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:15,178
His children and his children's children
will rise up and call him blessed.

257
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:19,552
This has been the most wonderful
evening I've had in years.

258
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,384
This has been the most wonderful
evening I've had in centuries.

259
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:28,157
- I hope I haven't left the key...
- Go on in. It's open.

260
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:28,295
Thank you.

261
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:30,195
Thank you.

262
00:20:30,264 --> 00:20:32,755
- Hello, Queenie.
- Hello, Queenie. How are you?

263
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,562
- Can I help you?
- Yes, please.

264
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:37,103
- All right.
- Oh! You got my shoe.

265
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:39,765
- Hello, Henry.
- Well, Henry.

266
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,604
I thought you were going to meet us
at St. Timothy's.

267
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:44,200
What happened to you?

268
00:20:44,278 --> 00:20:46,610
- Can I take that?
- Thank you. You'll never guess.

269
00:20:47,615 --> 00:20:49,549
- We went skating.
- The coat...

270
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:51,141
There you are.

271
00:20:51,885 --> 00:20:53,512
- See you in a minute.
- All right.

272
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:58,420
- Skating?
- Yes. Dudley's a marvelous skater.

273
00:20:58,492 --> 00:21:00,926
He made me imagine that I was good.

274
00:21:00,995 --> 00:21:05,432
You should have heard the boys
at St. Timothy's. It was heavenly.

275
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:08,093
- I'm sure of that.
- Did you have a successful meeting?

276
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:10,102
- Did you?
- Satisfactory.

277
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,230
Good. I want to see Debby
before she goes to sleep.

278
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:17,942
- You haven't said a word about it.
- About what?

279
00:21:18,012 --> 00:21:20,207
My new hat.

280
00:21:23,817 --> 00:21:26,149
- What do you think?
- Charming.

281
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:29,155
Thank you.
I'll be right down.

282
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,260
I know that Julia is
absolutely blameless in this.

283
00:21:34,328 --> 00:21:37,320
- Of course she is.
- You stopped me from joining you.

284
00:21:37,398 --> 00:21:40,026
Julia had a very good time.

285
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,829
I didn't.

286
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,071
If you'd sent me to Mrs. Hamilton's
I would have gone.

287
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,836
You didn't.
So I went with your wife.

288
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:51,104
Is that part of
the normal duties of an...

289
00:21:56,517 --> 00:21:58,041
Of an angel?

290
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:02,316
Sometimes angels must rush in
where fools fear to tread.

291
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:05,449
I don't know what that means
and don't explain it.

292
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,729
You can go now.

293
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:12,857
- I've solved my problem.
- Have you?

294
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:15,766
Mrs. Hamilton is giving the money
for the cathedral.

295
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:18,134
That was a foregone conclusion...

296
00:22:18,205 --> 00:22:21,641
if you were willing to sacrifice
your principles.

297
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:27,078
Don't you think this glorious edifice
is worth it?

298
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:31,415
I'm not so sure of its glory.

299
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:34,147
- You're not?
- No, I'm not.

300
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,846
These are lean years for the world.

301
00:22:37,925 --> 00:22:41,588
So many people need food and shelter.

302
00:22:41,662 --> 00:22:45,428
That big roof could make
so many little roofs.

303
00:22:45,499 --> 00:22:49,833
We're dealing with a materialistic
woman who doesn't care about that.

304
00:22:49,903 --> 00:22:51,837
Did you try?

305
00:22:52,973 --> 00:22:55,669
It's all arranged.
It's finished.

306
00:22:55,743 --> 00:22:58,871
You came so that I could have
a cathedral. Now I want you to go.

307
00:22:58,946 --> 00:23:01,642
Get out of my life and away from Julia.

308
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:05,909
Pray for that. It was
your prayer that brought me here.

309
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:32,372
- That was no prayer.
- It was right from my heart.

310
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:34,971
- I want you to go.
- Julia doesn't.

311
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,713
Get out!

312
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:44,316
Julia's coming back.
Don't let her see you like that.

313
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:46,325
Try to calm yourself.

314
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:02,641
Debby wants to say good night to Dudley.

315
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,142
- Where is he?
- He's gone.

316
00:24:05,212 --> 00:24:06,907
- Where?
- How should I know?

317
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:10,745
- Why did he leave?
- I got rid of him.

318
00:24:10,818 --> 00:24:13,719
- I fired him.
- Why?

319
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:16,984
He's incompetent
and I can't stand the sight of him!

320
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:49,984
Mummy, I'm sure that Dudley's
never coming back.

321
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:53,518
Darling, you must never say never.

322
00:24:53,594 --> 00:24:55,528
Where is he?

323
00:24:56,196 --> 00:24:58,130
Come here, dear.

324
00:25:00,901 --> 00:25:03,131
Listen to me.

325
00:25:03,203 --> 00:25:06,001
Dudley wouldn't leave
without saying a word.

326
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:09,565
Beside, he promised to tell you
about Santa Claus.

327
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:11,577
He knows him very well.

328
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,307
But it's almost Christmas Eve.

329
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,441
Soon I'll have to go to bed.

330
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:21,316
I told you he wouldn't leave
without saying a word.

331
00:25:21,388 --> 00:25:23,583
- Would he, Matilda?
- Oh, no.

332
00:25:23,657 --> 00:25:26,717
That wouldn't be like Mr. Dudley.

333
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:29,819
Come along, Debby.
I'll get you ready for dinner.

334
00:25:29,897 --> 00:25:33,663
- Will you come see me later?
- Of course.

335
00:25:56,657 --> 00:25:58,591
Here is the list of your calls.

336
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:01,127
- Ending at Mrs. Hamilton's.
- Thank you.

337
00:26:01,194 --> 00:26:04,186
Miss Cassaway, here is the manuscript
to my Christmas sermon.

338
00:26:04,264 --> 00:26:08,598
I shall want the original
and five carbons for the press.

339
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:12,002
If you finish before I come back,
leave them on my desk.

340
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:17,709
I'm sorry to keep you so long
on Christmas Eve.

341
00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:20,804
I understand.
It must be done.

342
00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:25,251
I'm ready to start out now.

343
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,845
We're going to the Trubb-Shaws,
then...

344
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:33,418
Then to the Van Dovers.

345
00:26:33,493 --> 00:26:35,427
Good-bye, Miss Cassaway.

346
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:49,207
- Sylvester!
- Hello, Julia.

347
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:50,675
What are you doing here?

348
00:26:50,744 --> 00:26:54,771
I've been waiting about an hour
hoping for another skating party.

349
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,009
I didn't want to miss it.
Where's Dudley?

350
00:26:57,084 --> 00:26:59,018
You got a preacher with you.

351
00:27:00,253 --> 00:27:02,278
Oh, I know!

352
00:27:02,356 --> 00:27:04,847
You and Dudley are getting married!

353
00:27:05,692 --> 00:27:09,093
Sylvester, this is my husband,
Bishop Brougham.

354
00:27:09,162 --> 00:27:11,562
- How do you do?
- Oh.

355
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:15,091
247 North Maple.

356
00:27:20,574 --> 00:27:22,804
247 North Maple.

357
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:40,125
- Mildred.
- Oh!

358
00:27:42,896 --> 00:27:45,524
Dudley, it's you.
I didn't see...

359
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:48,534
Where have you been?
We've been worrying about you.

360
00:27:48,602 --> 00:27:51,264
And poor Mrs. Brougham.

361
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:54,466
- What about her?
- She's been in and out of here all day.

362
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:57,408
Asking if we've seen or heard from you.

363
00:27:57,477 --> 00:28:00,674
- Where is she?
- She and the bishop are making calls...

364
00:28:00,747 --> 00:28:02,681
finishing at Mrs. Hamilton's.

365
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:08,553
- I'll type this for you.
- Oh, no.

366
00:28:08,622 --> 00:28:10,055
- You go.
- The bishop told me...

367
00:28:10,123 --> 00:28:13,058
It's almost Christmas Eve.
You must have shopping to do.

368
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:17,295
- Go on.
- Thank you, Dudley.

369
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:21,934
Merry Christmas, Mildred.

370
00:28:22,002 --> 00:28:23,936
Merry Christmas, Dudley.

371
00:28:55,702 --> 00:28:57,636
Take a sermon.

372
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:02,235
Tonight, I want to tell you the story
of an empty stocking.

373
00:29:04,344 --> 00:29:07,336
Once upon a midnight clear,
there was a chilïs cry.

374
00:29:08,548 --> 00:29:10,948
A blazing star hung over a stable...

375
00:29:11,017 --> 00:29:13,315
and wise men came with birthday gifts.

376
00:29:13,386 --> 00:29:14,853
Have you got that?

377
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:18,550
Good. We haven't forgotten that night
down the centuries.

378
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:22,083
We celebrate it with stars hung
on the Christmas tree and bells...

379
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:24,756
and gifts, especially gifts.

380
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:29,325
We buy them, wrap them
and put them under the tree.

381
00:29:29,402 --> 00:29:32,735
You give me a tie.
I give you a book.

382
00:29:32,806 --> 00:29:36,401
Aunt Martha wants
an orange squeezer.

383
00:29:36,476 --> 00:29:38,808
Uncle Harry can use a new pipe.

384
00:29:42,015 --> 00:29:45,610
We forget nobody, adult or child.

385
00:29:45,685 --> 00:29:47,277
All the stockings are filled.

386
00:29:47,354 --> 00:29:49,288
All except one.

387
00:30:14,748 --> 00:30:19,014
- I'm sorry, Matilda.
- Mr. Dudley, I knew you'd come back.

388
00:30:19,085 --> 00:30:21,918
I knew you hadn't walked out on us.

389
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:23,319
Of course not.

390
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,325
Debby's been so worried
and Mrs. Brougham...

391
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:29,226
Run upstairs.
Tell Debby I'll see her later.

392
00:30:29,296 --> 00:30:31,856
- I have some work to do.
- I'll tell her.

393
00:31:18,678 --> 00:31:20,873
One moment, please.

394
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:23,677
- Is Mrs. Hamilton expecting you?
- No, but she'll want to see me.

395
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:28,119
- I'm the bishop's assistant.
- You're not expected, but the bishop is.

396
00:31:28,188 --> 00:31:31,214
I told you, Stevens,
she'll wish to see me.

397
00:33:01,948 --> 00:33:05,748
"This was composed for you,
my darling, and you only. Allan."

398
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:07,980
Her husbanïs name was George.

399
00:35:12,312 --> 00:35:14,246
Good evening.

400
00:35:15,815 --> 00:35:18,215
That music you were playing.

401
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:20,718
I'm the only one living
that knows that composition.

402
00:35:21,554 --> 00:35:23,488
It's a shame that
we're the only ones...

403
00:35:23,556 --> 00:35:25,854
who appreciate the lost genius of
Allan Cartwright.

404
00:35:25,925 --> 00:35:28,826
- You know about him?
- Oh, yes.

405
00:35:28,895 --> 00:35:32,922
The world lost a brilliant,
young composer when he died.

406
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,494
That was forty years ago.
You couldn't have known him.

407
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:43,641
I'm older than you think.
Come, let us sit down.

408
00:35:49,616 --> 00:35:52,244
- What is your name?
- My name is Dudley.

409
00:35:55,522 --> 00:35:58,423
Tell me about Allan and you.

410
00:36:05,298 --> 00:36:06,629
Tell me.

411
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:13,066
Allan Cartwright
was the only man I ever loved.

412
00:36:14,908 --> 00:36:16,842
We were engaged to be married.

413
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,644
I got frightened.

414
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,847
He had nothing and
I was afraid of poverty.

415
00:36:23,917 --> 00:36:25,851
He went away.

416
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,354
I never saw him again.

417
00:36:31,124 --> 00:36:33,592
I never loved George Hamilton.

418
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,128
He was very much in love with me.

419
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:38,129
He was wealthy.

420
00:36:39,966 --> 00:36:43,402
I've spent a fortune honoring
his memory in empty monuments.

421
00:36:54,981 --> 00:36:57,541
The Hamilton mansion.
Never been here before.

422
00:36:57,617 --> 00:37:00,586
- What do I owe you?
- No charge. I'm not busy.

423
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:03,213
- Thank you, Sylvester.
- I'll be seeing you, Julia.

424
00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:14,595
That must be Henry and Julia
at the door.

425
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:18,296
The bishop! I can't see him now.

426
00:37:18,371 --> 00:37:20,805
- Oh, yes, you will.
- No!

427
00:37:20,873 --> 00:37:22,306
Yes.

428
00:37:24,344 --> 00:37:28,303
Just go out and greet them
in you usual warmhearted manner.

429
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:35,418
The Bishop and Mrs. Brougham
are calling, madame.

430
00:37:42,228 --> 00:37:45,925
- You'll stay for dinner?
- I'm afraid I can't.

431
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:47,933
I have work to do.

432
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:49,992
Don't keep Henry and Julia waiting.

433
00:38:02,815 --> 00:38:04,749
How do you do, Mrs. Hamilton?

434
00:38:05,818 --> 00:38:08,412
How nice of you to come and see me.

435
00:38:10,423 --> 00:38:12,391
Merry Christmas.

436
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,260
Let's go into the drawing room.

437
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:27,335
- Merry Christmas to you too.
- Oh, we're old friends. Call me Agnes.

438
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:30,909
You too, Julia, dear.

439
00:38:30,977 --> 00:38:33,002
Yes, of course.

440
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:39,751
But he's gone already.

441
00:38:40,253 --> 00:38:41,618
Who?

442
00:38:43,923 --> 00:38:46,016
- He was here.
- I should have known it.

443
00:38:46,092 --> 00:38:49,960
- Where did he go?
- The poor man had so much work to do.

444
00:38:50,029 --> 00:38:51,963
You must make him take some rest.

445
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:53,965
I've been trying to.

446
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:57,969
I can't thank you enough
for sending him to me. But sit down.

447
00:38:58,037 --> 00:39:03,498
Meeting Dudley has been the greatest
spiritual experience of my life.

448
00:39:03,576 --> 00:39:04,838
I'm so glad.

449
00:39:04,911 --> 00:39:07,607
How did you find him?

450
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,875
- It was an accident.
- It was a miracle.

451
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:14,113
Indeed. Talking with this
wonderful, understanding man has...

452
00:39:15,888 --> 00:39:18,914
I've changed my mind
about the cathedral.

453
00:39:18,991 --> 00:39:23,121
My money's going to those who need it.
The poor and the homeless.

454
00:39:23,196 --> 00:39:27,428
The unappreciated people here
and around the world.

455
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,731
I want you to direct
the spending of the money.

456
00:39:30,803 --> 00:39:33,533
- You see what Dudley has done?
- I see.

457
00:39:33,606 --> 00:39:36,302
- Now you understand...
- Thank you, Mrs. Hamilton.

458
00:39:38,077 --> 00:39:40,204
I'll be home later
for dinner, or something.

459
00:39:41,013 --> 00:39:43,345
I don't know what...

460
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:45,350
Good-bye.

461
00:40:31,798 --> 00:40:32,890
Hello, Professor.

462
00:40:34,901 --> 00:40:36,835
Come in, my dear fellow.

463
00:40:37,904 --> 00:40:40,065
Sit down.
Let me take your coat.

464
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:42,733
- No, thanks.
- Not there. Here.

465
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:44,970
This is the only reliable chair.

466
00:40:45,044 --> 00:40:48,775
This is a surprise and an honor.

467
00:40:48,848 --> 00:40:50,782
We must have a glass of sherry.

468
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:53,148
- No, thank you.
- I insist.

469
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:55,881
I want to show you something.

470
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:59,152
You see this bottle
and note that it is full?

471
00:40:59,225 --> 00:41:00,749
Watch.

472
00:41:00,827 --> 00:41:06,163
This is inexplicable even to you with
your vast ecclesiastical knowledge.

473
00:41:09,435 --> 00:41:11,869
Observe that it is still full.

474
00:41:11,938 --> 00:41:15,430
How do you account for that?
And the sherry.

475
00:41:15,508 --> 00:41:18,773
It stimulates, warms and inspires.

476
00:41:18,845 --> 00:41:22,144
But no matter how much you drink,
it never inebriates.

477
00:41:22,215 --> 00:41:24,979
I can account for it.
Dudley's been here.

478
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:28,017
And that's not all.

479
00:41:28,087 --> 00:41:30,681
He told me some things about history
that opened my eyes.

480
00:41:30,756 --> 00:41:34,988
Today I went to the university library
and read some ancient texts...

481
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:38,428
which have been undecipherable
to living scholars.

482
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:41,989
Suddenly, I could understand them.

483
00:41:42,068 --> 00:41:45,731
And this is what I have done,
thanks to Dudley.

484
00:41:45,805 --> 00:41:49,070
I'm actually writing my history.

485
00:41:49,141 --> 00:41:53,339
Let's face it. Dudley is no
mortal man like the rest of us.

486
00:41:54,447 --> 00:41:56,574
Is he?

487
00:41:56,649 --> 00:41:59,413
- How did you know?
- I can't tell.

488
00:41:59,485 --> 00:42:02,079
- What is he?
- He says he's an angel.

489
00:42:02,154 --> 00:42:05,419
- An angel.
- Nothing stopped me that time.

490
00:42:05,491 --> 00:42:08,426
- From heaven?
- That I'm not sure about.

491
00:42:08,494 --> 00:42:09,927
An angel.

492
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,626
Too bad. He's such a nice fellow.

493
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,634
I should have known.

494
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:19,068
Nothing less could have put me to work.

495
00:42:19,138 --> 00:42:21,072
I'm glad he's done somebody some good.

496
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,131
He's brought nothing but disaster
for me.

497
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:26,474
That's absurd. He and Julia
were here the other day.

498
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:31,039
She seemed happy, quite like
her old, delightful self.

499
00:42:31,117 --> 00:42:34,416
She's a different person
when she's with him.

500
00:42:34,487 --> 00:42:36,455
He's made her despise me.

501
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:40,223
Are you sure he has done that?

502
00:42:40,293 --> 00:42:42,955
- You think it's my fault?
- I didn't say that.

503
00:42:43,029 --> 00:42:46,226
This is a mystery
beyond my powers of comprehension.

504
00:42:46,299 --> 00:42:48,790
I suppose I am to blame
for everything.

505
00:42:48,868 --> 00:42:50,927
I asked for this in more ways than one.

506
00:42:52,672 --> 00:42:57,905
Dudley's presence only confirmed that
I'd already lost Julia and Debby's love.

507
00:43:00,413 --> 00:43:02,973
I must confess, my old friend.

508
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:05,483
You generously sent me a coin.

509
00:43:05,551 --> 00:43:09,988
And I only saw its commercial value.
Now I don't know where it is.

510
00:43:10,056 --> 00:43:12,456
I do. Here it is.

511
00:43:15,895 --> 00:43:18,295
Where did you find it?
Don't tell me.

512
00:43:18,364 --> 00:43:23,267
And what's more he told me what it is.
A muzeum piece. Worth a fortune.

513
00:43:23,336 --> 00:43:27,102
You keep it. Give it to Julia
as my Christmas present.

514
00:43:27,173 --> 00:43:29,539
It might bring luck to you both.

515
00:43:29,608 --> 00:43:32,202
It seems strange, you a bishop...

516
00:43:32,278 --> 00:43:34,746
and me, a broken-down, old scholar.

517
00:43:34,814 --> 00:43:36,782
I feel terribly sorry for you.

518
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:39,215
I wish I could help.

519
00:43:39,285 --> 00:43:42,220
- There's nothing to be done.
- There must be.

520
00:43:42,288 --> 00:43:45,280
You and Julia have always
loved each other.

521
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:47,155
That's only partially true.

522
00:43:47,226 --> 00:43:49,558
- I love Julia...
- Then fight for her.

523
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:51,118
How can I?

524
00:43:51,197 --> 00:43:53,631
You have a tremendous advantage.

525
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:56,862
- Advantage over an angel?
- That's precisely it.

526
00:43:56,936 --> 00:43:59,734
He's an angel.
Julia is a creature of earth.

527
00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:03,104
She's a woman and you are a man.

528
00:44:14,987 --> 00:44:18,445
Isn't it beautiful?
He did every bit of it himself.

529
00:44:18,524 --> 00:44:23,359
So quick too.
I couldn't believe my eyes.

530
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:27,889
- What a blessing he's been.
- The tree's lovely.

531
00:44:27,967 --> 00:44:32,495
I'm glad you like it. It's been years
since I've decorated a tree.

532
00:44:32,571 --> 00:44:35,665
I usually get
the more disagreeable jobs.

533
00:44:39,045 --> 00:44:40,512
Good night, Matilda.

534
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:43,309
- Sweet dreams.
- Thank you, Mr. Dudley.

535
00:44:54,627 --> 00:44:57,027
I think my work here is almost finished.

536
00:44:57,096 --> 00:44:59,326
I'll have to be going.

537
00:45:02,635 --> 00:45:04,933
Where will you be going?

538
00:45:05,004 --> 00:45:07,370
Wherever they send me.

539
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,805
Who are they?

540
00:45:10,142 --> 00:45:12,372
My superior officers.

541
00:45:13,446 --> 00:45:16,938
Will we ever see you again?

542
00:45:18,117 --> 00:45:20,585
They seldom send us
to the same place twice.

543
00:45:20,653 --> 00:45:22,587
We might form attachments.

544
00:45:24,223 --> 00:45:28,057
- I don't understand.
- Of course not.

545
00:45:33,165 --> 00:45:35,133
- I don't want to leave.
- Why?

546
00:45:36,802 --> 00:45:39,999
There are few people who know the
secret of making a heaven here on Earth.

547
00:45:40,072 --> 00:45:41,903
You are one of them.

548
00:45:46,112 --> 00:45:50,742
- I think you should go.
- Please don't send me away.

549
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,351
- What are you saying?
- I'm tired of wandering.

550
00:45:57,423 --> 00:46:02,326
I'm tired of existing where one is
neither hot nor cold, hungry nor full.

551
00:46:08,467 --> 00:46:11,698
You must go away and never come back.

552
00:46:33,826 --> 00:46:38,456
I've never fought an angel, but take off
your coat and put up your dukes.

553
00:46:38,531 --> 00:46:40,658
Why do you want to fight me?

554
00:46:42,835 --> 00:46:47,602
Because you tried to steal my wife,
my child, the love that belongs to me.

555
00:46:47,673 --> 00:46:49,607
Don't you realize that as an angel...

556
00:46:49,675 --> 00:46:52,667
I could destroy you
with a bolt of lightning?

557
00:46:52,745 --> 00:46:55,407
I don't care. Julia means
more to me than my life.

558
00:46:55,481 --> 00:46:57,415
I'm not gonna lose her.

559
00:47:00,386 --> 00:47:03,116
Then I have news for you.
I'm going.

560
00:47:06,692 --> 00:47:09,388
I'll accept that when I see it.

561
00:47:09,461 --> 00:47:10,860
No, you won't.

562
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:15,833
Because when I go you'll never know
an angel visited your house.

563
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:19,803
- What about Julia?
- She won't remember either.

564
00:47:19,872 --> 00:47:23,239
Nor will Debby, the professor
or anyone else.

565
00:47:24,977 --> 00:47:27,639
- I don't trust you.
- You may.

566
00:47:27,713 --> 00:47:30,546
Because your prayer has been answered.

567
00:47:30,616 --> 00:47:34,211
That's not true.
I was praying for a cathedral.

568
00:47:34,286 --> 00:47:37,449
No, you were praying for guidance.

569
00:47:37,523 --> 00:47:39,457
That has been given to you.

570
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:48,533
Just a minute, please.

571
00:47:49,702 --> 00:47:51,636
Good-bye, Henry.

572
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:01,743
If we need you again,
will you come back?

573
00:48:01,814 --> 00:48:03,145
Not I.

574
00:48:03,215 --> 00:48:06,878
I should ask to be assigned
to the other end of the universe.

575
00:48:06,952 --> 00:48:09,978
Because I was so difficult?

576
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:11,989
This difficulty was in me.

577
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:17,154
When an immortal envies the mortal
entrusted to him it's a danger signal.

578
00:48:18,297 --> 00:48:20,731
Take her in your arms
and hold her tight.

579
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,734
Coming.

580
00:48:24,737 --> 00:48:26,830
Kiss her for me, you lucky Henry.

581
00:49:18,223 --> 00:49:20,157
She's asleep.

582
00:49:22,828 --> 00:49:24,762
Are you all right?

583
00:49:25,698 --> 00:49:27,632
Of course I am.

584
00:49:29,034 --> 00:49:31,025
Did you get that for Debby?

585
00:49:37,209 --> 00:49:39,143
I can't imagine where it came from.

586
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:53,351
Why, Henry. What is it?

587
00:49:54,693 --> 00:49:56,684
I don't know. L...

588
00:49:56,762 --> 00:50:00,163
I just have the most inexplicable
feeling of happiness.

589
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:02,923
- You know something?
- What?

590
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:04,992
There's a big bowl of cider downstairs.

591
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:06,697
That's for tomorrow afternoon.

592
00:50:06,772 --> 00:50:09,297
Let's drink it now. To us.

593
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:11,309
To our happiness and what lies ahead.

594
00:50:11,377 --> 00:50:14,244
Then let's smash the glasses
in the fireplace.

595
00:50:15,447 --> 00:50:16,880
Listen.

596
00:50:19,518 --> 00:50:21,782
That's coming from St. Timothy's.

597
00:50:23,122 --> 00:50:26,819
Let's have the cider
after your Christmas Eve sermon.

598
00:50:26,892 --> 00:50:29,122
- Oh, my sermon.
- Yes.

599
00:50:29,194 --> 00:50:30,752
That's better still.

600
00:50:32,798 --> 00:50:37,565
Ring the bells in adoration

601
00:50:42,808 --> 00:50:46,266
We pour
We pour to Thee

602
00:50:46,345 --> 00:50:50,008
Our supplication

603
00:50:50,082 --> 00:50:52,380
That Thou wouldst

604
00:50:52,451 --> 00:50:55,352
Grant us Lord

605
00:50:55,421 --> 00:51:01,326
Salvation

606
00:51:15,474 --> 00:51:17,965
Tonight I want to tell you the story...

607
00:51:18,043 --> 00:51:19,977
of an empty stocking.

608
00:51:23,015 --> 00:51:25,483
Once upon a midnight clear...

609
00:51:25,551 --> 00:51:27,485
there was a chilïs cry.

610
00:51:29,588 --> 00:51:31,920
A blazing star hung over a stable...

611
00:51:33,492 --> 00:51:35,722
and wise men came with birthday gifts.

612
00:51:37,696 --> 00:51:40,824
We haven't forgotten that night
down the centuries.

613
00:51:40,899 --> 00:51:43,891
We celebrate it with stars
on Christmas trees...

614
00:51:43,969 --> 00:51:46,995
with the sound of bells
and with gifts.

615
00:51:47,773 --> 00:51:50,003
Especially with gifts.

616
00:51:50,876 --> 00:51:52,810
You give me a book.

617
00:51:52,878 --> 00:51:55,142
I give you a tie.

618
00:51:55,214 --> 00:51:58,809
Aunt Martha wants an orange squeezer.

619
00:51:58,884 --> 00:52:02,445
Uncle Henry can use a new pipe.

620
00:52:03,522 --> 00:52:06,719
We forget nobody, adult or child.

621
00:52:06,792 --> 00:52:09,386
All the stockings are filled.

622
00:52:09,461 --> 00:52:12,862
All, that is, except one.

623
00:52:13,999 --> 00:52:17,696
And we have even forgotten
to hang it up.

624
00:52:17,769 --> 00:52:21,364
A stocking for the child
born in a manger.

625
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,533
It's His birthday we're celebrating.

626
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:27,579
Let's not ever forget that.

627
00:52:27,646 --> 00:52:29,978
Let us ask ourselves...

628
00:52:30,048 --> 00:52:32,949
what He would wish for most.

629
00:52:33,018 --> 00:52:36,078
And then let each put in his share.

630
00:52:37,656 --> 00:52:42,150
Loving kindness, warm hearts...
