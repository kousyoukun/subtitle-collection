1
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,915
Hark! The herald angels sing

2
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,972
Glory to the newborn King

3
00:01:20,043 --> 00:01:23,938
Peace on earth
and mercy mild

4
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:28,234
God and sinners reconcile

5
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:32,097
Joyful, all ye nations rise

6
00:01:32,171 --> 00:01:36,100
Join the triumph of the skies

7
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:40,230
With th'angelic hosts proclaim

8
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:44,390
Christ is born in Bethlehem

9
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:48,453
Hark! The herald angels sing

10
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:52,799
Glory to the newborn King

11
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:56,671
Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace

12
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,969
Hail the Son of Righteousness

13
00:02:01,036 --> 00:02:05,480
Light and life to all He brings

14
00:02:04,843 --> 00:02:09,079
Risen with healing in His wings

15
00:02:32,012 --> 00:02:34,946
- This is very kind of you.
- It's a privilege.

16
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:50,503
- Which way are you going?
- Just over there. The Mutual building.

17
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:54,248
- My doctor's there. See, I have hopes.
- Fine.

18
00:02:54,315 --> 00:02:56,519
- I'm all right now.
- Good luck to you.

19
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:59,042
Thank you so much.
Merry Christmas to you.

20
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:00,970
Merry Christmas.

21
00:03:20,107 --> 00:03:22,496
Mother, please!
Please lift me up!

22
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:25,450
All right.
Just for a minute.

23
00:03:26,988 --> 00:03:28,842
Look at that, Mom!

24
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:31,650
Look at the funny choo-choo train!

25
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:33,990
Come on, darling.
We have to go.

26
00:03:37,804 --> 00:03:40,160
Oh, my baby!

27
00:03:42,059 --> 00:03:45,987
You saved her!
Thank God, you saved my baby!

28
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,408
- How can I ever thank you?
- Just don't let it happen again.

29
00:03:49,483 --> 00:03:52,865
- I promise you, I won't.
- Remember that. Now on your way.

30
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:54,314
Yes.

31
00:04:36,394 --> 00:04:40,584
Mostly resembles its cousin,
the California red fir.

32
00:04:40,651 --> 00:04:43,269
His botanical head is similar.

33
00:04:42,827 --> 00:04:46,307
Pay me heed.
This is a specimen of the white fir.

34
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,661
Surely, you being a native Roman
know your Latin.

35
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:52,673
You wanna buy or not?

36
00:04:54,923 --> 00:04:58,118
- If it isn't my dear, beautiful Julia.
- Hello, Professor.

37
00:04:58,187 --> 00:05:00,553
What are you doing
in this part of town?

38
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,610
Buying a Christmas tree.
Hello, Mr. Maggenti.

39
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:07,081
- Mrs. Brougham, how do you do?
- What do you charge for this weed?

40
00:05:07,146 --> 00:05:11,903
- $1.85.
- For this halfhearted twig?

41
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,426
I'll pay you 10 cents a branch
or take my trade elsewhere.

42
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:20,264
- What can I do for you?
- You can save me that tree outside.

43
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,567
- The big one by the door.
- Okay.

44
00:05:22,634 --> 00:05:26,689
- Thank you.
- Each Christmas for the past 18 years...

45
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:28,801
Maggenti and I have been reenacting
the same argument.

46
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,000
I didn't know
you celebrated Christmas.

47
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:33,925
- I thought you had no religion.
- That's true, my dear.

48
00:05:33,995 --> 00:05:38,399
But I like having a Christmas tree
because it reminds me of my childhood.

49
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:42,536
I feel that this is a good time
for looking backwards.

50
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:45,450
Can you imagine me
ever having been a child?

51
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:47,882
How's Henry?
I haven't seen him lately.

52
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,048
He's well, thank you.

53
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,865
He's terribly tired
and worried.

54
00:05:54,858 --> 00:05:57,378
Is he having difficulty
raising money for the cathedral?

55
00:05:58,572 --> 00:06:00,807
Yes.
It's slow work.

56
00:06:02,315 --> 00:06:05,098
- How's your book coming?
- Splendidly.

57
00:06:05,163 --> 00:06:07,301
Greatest history of Rome since Gibbon.

58
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,541
Of course,
nobody will read it.

59
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,563
And now, my good man, I choose not
to prolong this bickering any further.

60
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:17,504
All right.
Ten cents a branch.

61
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,110
- It's $1.40.
- Very well, my old friend.

62
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,033
Here is your blood money.

63
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:28,514
Will you send the tree up on
Christmas Eve? But not until late.

64
00:06:28,587 --> 00:06:30,824
- I don't want my daughter seeing it.
- Don't worry.

65
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,192
I'll send it
when the little bambino goes to bed.

66
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,560
Merry Christmas.

67
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,266
Come on.

68
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:49,825
There's something I'd like you to give
Henry for his cathedral fund.

69
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:51,808
That's my lucky piece.

70
00:06:51,882 --> 00:06:54,882
Not that it's brought me any luck,
except knowing you.

71
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:59,550
It's an old Roman coin. I picked it up
years ago in a junk shop.

72
00:06:58,858 --> 00:07:00,516
It has little value.

73
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,902
- It's a wonderful contribution.
- Nonsense.

74
00:07:03,978 --> 00:07:06,401
It might be called
the widow's might...

75
00:07:06,474 --> 00:07:09,192
if it weren't for the fact
that I'm not a widow.

76
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:13,666
Julia, this is no occasion for tears.

77
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:16,389
It stopped snowing.

78
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:19,425
If only we could spend Christmas here
where we were so happy...

79
00:07:19,498 --> 00:07:21,353
with you and our friends.

80
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:23,274
Now, now.

81
00:07:25,418 --> 00:07:29,925
- Good night. I'll see you again soon.
- It can't be soon enough.

82
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:32,034
Good night, Julia.

83
00:07:39,307 --> 00:07:43,201
Professor! How fine
to see you again after all these years!

84
00:07:43,274 --> 00:07:45,346
- How well you look.
- How are you?

85
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:48,834
- Never better. And you?
- Quite well, thank you.

86
00:07:50,378 --> 00:07:54,153
- I don't think you remember me.
- Preposterous! Of course I do.

87
00:07:54,218 --> 00:07:57,187
- Where did we meet?
- Professor, after all these years.

88
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:00,324
Just a moment.
It wasn't Vienna, was it?

89
00:08:00,394 --> 00:08:03,000
- Beautiful, old Vienna.
- The university?

90
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,413
- The university.
- When I lectured on Roman history.

91
00:08:05,483 --> 00:08:07,937
That's it.
And what great lectures they were.

92
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,557
- And what you were with the ladies!
- Fancy, you remembering that.

93
00:08:11,627 --> 00:08:13,481
I must confess,
I had my moments.

94
00:08:13,546 --> 00:08:16,209
And still have.

95
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:17,673
- Where are you going?
- That car!

96
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:21,632
I couldn't help noticing
your tender parting from Julia.

97
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,500
- Do you know Julia?
- In a way, yes.

98
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,629
- Poor child.
- She's unhappy?

99
00:08:27,338 --> 00:08:31,015
- When were you in Vienna?
- I've been there many times.

100
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:33,667
I'm interested in
Julia and Henry.

101
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:36,837
- What seems to be their trouble?
- I never see Henry anymore.

102
00:08:36,906 --> 00:08:39,175
He has no time for riffraff like me.

103
00:08:39,242 --> 00:08:42,406
He now consults with the vulgar rich,
like Mrs. Hamilton.

104
00:08:42,474 --> 00:08:45,474
You know, she had me fired
from the university here?

105
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:49,256
Said I was a radical. I, who've never
taken any interest in politics...

106
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:51,264
since the death of Nero.

107
00:08:51,338 --> 00:08:53,193
Look at that.

108
00:08:53,258 --> 00:08:57,251
Henry's old church,
perishing from neglect.
"Benefit - help save St. Timothy's"

109
00:08:58,634 --> 00:09:02,017
- It's such a nice, little church.
- Too little, I'm afraid.

110
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,385
It can't stand up
against the march of progress.

111
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,305
I must be pushing on.

112
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,312
- Delighted to have seen you.
- It's a pleasure.

113
00:09:09,386 --> 00:09:13,925
- We must get together and have a drink.
- By all means!

114
00:09:15,562 --> 00:09:17,929
- Good evening, Professor.
- Pat.

115
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:20,678
Have you any idea
who that man is?

116
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:22,601
No. He's a stranger to me.

117
00:09:31,498 --> 00:09:34,018
- Good evening, Mrs. Brougham.
- Good evening, Matilda.

118
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,195
Hello, Queenie.
Is Debby in bed yet?

119
00:09:36,266 --> 00:09:41,099
Yes. Mrs. Hamilton and the committee
are in there with the bishop.

120
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:45,000
The dinner's been waiting a long time.
I don't know what to do about it.

121
00:09:45,066 --> 00:09:47,554
We'll have dinner
as soon as they leave.

122
00:09:47,626 --> 00:09:50,593
- What about the chicken...
- Don't worry about it, please.

123
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,521
Here. Thank you.

124
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,073
My bag.

125
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,105
There. Thank you.

126
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:04,450
I'm very displeased
with your whole attitude.

127
00:10:07,338 --> 00:10:10,299
I'm terribly sorry I'm so late.

128
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,999
Good evening, Mrs. Hamilton.
I was delayed Christmas shopping.

129
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:15,171
Good evening, Mr. Perry, Mrs. Trumbuss.

130
00:10:15,242 --> 00:10:18,009
Hello, Mrs. Ward.

131
00:10:17,802 --> 00:10:19,657
I hope you've been having
a good meeting.

132
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:23,999
We have not. I've never encountered
such fuzzy thinking.

133
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:27,619
- Do you think we've made progress?
- No, Mrs. Hamilton.

134
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:29,169
Mr. Perry was about
to tell us something.

135
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,810
Merely a suggestion.
If you approve...

136
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:36,072
we can place the George B. Hamilton
chapel here on the northeast.

137
00:10:36,138 --> 00:10:38,658
It'd be out of sight.
I won't stand for it.

138
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:43,007
This cathedral can't be designed
for the glory of an individual.

139
00:10:43,082 --> 00:10:44,937
It has to be created
for all the people.

140
00:10:45,002 --> 00:10:47,653
I'm displeased
at your whole attitude.

141
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:50,111
You forget I was instrumental
in having you made bishop...

142
00:10:50,186 --> 00:10:52,073
although I thought you too young.

143
00:10:52,137 --> 00:10:54,407
- Is that an exaggeration?
- Oh, yes...

144
00:10:54,474 --> 00:10:58,118
- I mean, no.
- You were the guiding spirit.

145
00:10:58,186 --> 00:11:00,674
- I distinctly remember...
- I had every confidence in you...

146
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:02,818
when you were a poor parson
in the church in the slums.

147
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,995
I confess, my confidence is weakened.

148
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:07,074
I regret I've been
such a disappointment.

149
00:11:07,145 --> 00:11:09,284
Regrets and apologies are no good.

150
00:11:09,354 --> 00:11:13,697
You give the impression of being
indecisive and ineffectual.

151
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:16,933
That is not the kind of leadership
we expect of our bishop.

152
00:11:17,002 --> 00:11:21,192
You better remember one thing: You'll
build that cathedral as I want it...

153
00:11:21,258 --> 00:11:23,080
or you'll not build it at all.

154
00:11:23,146 --> 00:11:25,001
That's all I have to say.

155
00:11:26,058 --> 00:11:29,119
Someone get this dog
out of the way.

156
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,665
Queenie.

157
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:33,577
Good night.

158
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:35,103
- Good evening.
- Good night.

159
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:37,033
Good evening.

160
00:11:49,993 --> 00:11:52,165
- Can we serve dinner now?
- Yes.

161
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:55,649
- The chicken will be burned to a crisp.
- We'll be right in.

162
00:11:59,562 --> 00:12:02,628
You knew they were expected here
for the meeting this afternoon.

163
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:06,560
- I know. I'm sorry I was late.
- What a ghastly afternoon.

164
00:12:06,634 --> 00:12:08,489
What a ghastly woman.

165
00:12:08,554 --> 00:12:11,369
I trust she understood I've no intention
of being strangled by her purse strings.

166
00:12:11,434 --> 00:12:14,052
- She did. I was proud of you.
- I had a most unchristian impulse...

167
00:12:14,122 --> 00:12:16,991
to take those blueprints
and give her a good whack over the...

168
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:18,627
mink coat.

169
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:20,640
I thought you stood up to her
magnificently.

170
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,325
I appreciate your appreciation,
but what about my cathedral?

171
00:12:24,394 --> 00:12:27,940
May I make a suggestion?
Postpone the cathedral.

172
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:32,232
- Forget about it until after Christmas.
- A house of God can't be put off.

173
00:12:32,298 --> 00:12:35,015
This cathedral must rise. There are
other rich people in this town...

174
00:12:35,082 --> 00:12:37,384
and if I have to enlist
their financial enthusiasm...

175
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,337
then I'll take advantage
of their yuletide spirit.

176
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:41,506
I can see it all now.

177
00:12:41,577 --> 00:12:47,142
Those people, the luncheons, committee
meetings and you there, flattering them.

178
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,177
- Kowtowing and begging them.
- It's got to be done.

179
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,185
If you could see
your poor, harassed face.

180
00:12:53,258 --> 00:12:56,934
- You haven't done much to help it!
- Why... Yes, Miss Cassaway? What is it?

181
00:12:57,002 --> 00:12:59,271
Mr. Trevor on the phone.
He says it's urgent.

182
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:02,371
- Tell him the bishop will call him back.
- Yes, Mrs. Brougham.

183
00:13:05,258 --> 00:13:08,935
What's happened to you?
What's happened to us and our marriage?

184
00:13:09,002 --> 00:13:12,231
We used to have such fun,
you, Debby and I.

185
00:13:12,297 --> 00:13:15,232
We used to be happy.
We used to make other people happy.

186
00:13:15,306 --> 00:13:19,103
That was your gift. You're no financier
and you're not a promoter.

187
00:13:19,177 --> 00:13:22,047
You can't see beyond your nose.
I want this cathedral to stand...

188
00:13:22,122 --> 00:13:23,977
like a great beacon,
it's light shining...

189
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:28,264
Never mind, Henry. Keep that
for your next committee meeting.

190
00:13:33,034 --> 00:13:34,888
Here's a contribution I collected.

191
00:13:36,138 --> 00:13:38,309
- What's that?
- An old Roman coin.

192
00:13:38,377 --> 00:13:41,345
Professor Wutheridge sent it to you.
Wasn't it sweet of him?

193
00:13:41,418 --> 00:13:43,873
Old fool.
What can I do with that?

194
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:46,815
Well. It's a beginning.

195
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:52,489
- All you need is another four million.
- Don't be flippant about this!

196
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:57,641
- Is dinner ready?
- Yes.

197
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,415
Let's get it over with.
I have a lot of work to do.

198
00:14:10,826 --> 00:14:15,560
For what we're about to receive, may the
Lord make us truly thankful. Amen.

199
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:45,193
I was just thinking...

200
00:14:45,258 --> 00:14:47,625
tomorrow,
maybe we could go out together.

201
00:14:48,618 --> 00:14:50,243
Where?

202
00:14:50,314 --> 00:14:53,630
We'll just walk around
the way we used to.

203
00:14:54,442 --> 00:14:57,027
We could call on the professor.

204
00:14:57,097 --> 00:15:00,676
Or go to the park and watch
the skaters... that sort of thing.

205
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:02,851
Maybe we could have lunch together.

206
00:15:02,922 --> 00:15:05,027
At Michel's.
Remember that?

207
00:15:05,098 --> 00:15:06,952
Michel's.

208
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:10,309
It's been years
since we've been there.

209
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:15,016
Forgive me. I've been trying
to explain to Mr. Trevor...

210
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,529
but he insists upon
speaking to you personally, Bishop.

211
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:20,457
Excuse me, darling.

212
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:28,190
Keep the soup warm, please.
The bishop's been called to the phone.

213
00:15:28,265 --> 00:15:30,502
And tell Delia
we'll be out for lunch tomorrow.

214
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,358
Yes, ma'am.

215
00:15:33,386 --> 00:15:36,459
Of course, Mr. Trevor.
Yes, but...

216
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:38,565
I appreciate your difficulties...

217
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,559
Very well. I'll be there.
10:30 tomorrow morning...

218
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,480
then we'll go on
to the board meeting.

219
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,934
All right.
Good-bye.

220
00:15:49,258 --> 00:15:51,429
Put down Mr. Trevor's office
at 10:30 tomorrow...

221
00:15:51,498 --> 00:15:53,920
and the board meeting at
the bankers' club at 11:00.

222
00:15:53,993 --> 00:15:57,092
- Yes, sir. Tomorrow, Thursday.
- You might as well go home now.

223
00:15:57,161 --> 00:16:00,031
- There's a great deal of work to do.
- You must be very tired.

224
00:16:00,105 --> 00:16:04,328
Thank you. And don't forget, tomorrow
you speak to the junior assembly.

225
00:16:04,393 --> 00:16:06,335
- What time is that?
- At lunch, 1:00.

226
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:10,289
Remember, you made the appointment
over a month ago.

227
00:16:11,177 --> 00:16:13,316
- Good night, Bishop.
- Good night.

228
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,635
Oh, God.
What am I to do?

229
00:16:26,858 --> 00:16:29,476
Can't you help me?
Can't you tell me?

230
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:32,961
Oh, God.
Please help me.

231
00:17:10,346 --> 00:17:12,234
- Good evening.
- Good...

232
00:17:13,258 --> 00:17:15,330
What can I do for you?

233
00:17:15,403 --> 00:17:17,289
That isn't the question.

234
00:17:17,354 --> 00:17:19,874
Well, what is?

235
00:17:19,946 --> 00:17:22,433
What can I do for you?

236
00:17:22,506 --> 00:17:24,894
I must ask you to telephone
my secretary for an appointment.

237
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:27,392
- I'm in the middle of dinner.
- I know, Henry.

238
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:31,361
Your soup will keep warm.
You asked for help.

239
00:17:31,434 --> 00:17:33,605
I? L...

240
00:17:34,698 --> 00:17:36,324
Who told you?

241
00:17:36,394 --> 00:17:38,183
Well.

242
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,184
You're known to be a good man
and you were heard.

243
00:17:41,258 --> 00:17:43,975
I was instructed to come here
in answer to your prayer.

244
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:45,896
- Who are you?
- I'm an angel.

245
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:51,271
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm an angel.

246
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:54,688
- No wings at the moment, but...
- You're an angel?

247
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,894
I knew it.
I've been working too hard.

248
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:07,007
I understand.
It's hard to believe, even for you.

249
00:18:07,082 --> 00:18:09,504
Of course, I'm not
one of the more important angels.

250
00:18:09,578 --> 00:18:12,840
I just happen to be assigned
to this district temporarily.

251
00:18:12,907 --> 00:18:15,309
You see, we're everywhere...

252
00:18:14,826 --> 00:18:16,681
helping people who deserve to be...

253
00:18:18,857 --> 00:18:20,516
to be helped.

254
00:18:20,586 --> 00:18:23,106
As you walk through
the streets of the city...

255
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:25,219
you may suddenly
look into a strange face.

256
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:29,153
It may be the face of a murderer
or it may be the face of an angel.

257
00:18:31,146 --> 00:18:34,442
You're having problems with
the building of this cathedral?

258
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:38,150
- Yes.
- It's a fine cathedral.

259
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:41,087
It ought to look magnificent
on top of Sanctuary Hill.

260
00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:48,966
Well, Henry. Do you believe
I am what I say I am?

261
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:50,660
Well, how can I?

262
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,065
- I've only got your word for it.
- But you're a bishop.

263
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:55,465
You, of all people,
can trust the word of an angel.

264
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:57,384
I'd like to.

265
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,167
What do you propose to do?

266
00:19:00,234 --> 00:19:02,373
- Perform a miracle?
- If necessary.

267
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:06,304
Why don't you? Why don't you create
the cathedral with a wave of your hand?

268
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,193
You wouldn't want me to do that.
How would you explain it?

269
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:13,090
- Well, I'd...
- Tell the world an angel visited you?

270
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:14,664
You can't do that.

271
00:19:17,258 --> 00:19:19,495
Is anything wrong?
L...

272
00:19:19,563 --> 00:19:21,569
I'm sorry.
I didn't know that you had...

273
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:25,417
- Julia, if you don't mind.
- How do you do, Julia?

274
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:29,410
I'm Dudley. Henry's engaged me
to help him with his work.

275
00:19:29,481 --> 00:19:31,890
You mean you're going to be
his assistant?

276
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:36,009
That's it. I'm going to help Henry
to rest and get some relaxation.

277
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,562
- That's what I've been praying for.
- You too?

278
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:40,609
I'm so relieved.

279
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:42,625
Isn't it wonderful
you found someone to help you.

280
00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:44,487
- But...
- Where do you come from?

281
00:19:44,554 --> 00:19:46,626
- All around.
- Yes, but where?

282
00:19:46,699 --> 00:19:49,567
To tell you the truth,
he says that he's an a...

283
00:19:51,242 --> 00:19:53,893
I've been doing some
social service work downtown.

284
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:56,035
And now you're going to be
with Henry permanently?

285
00:19:56,105 --> 00:19:58,625
For as long as may be necessary.

286
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,186
If you don't mind,
I must talk to this gentleman alone.

287
00:20:01,258 --> 00:20:03,396
I'll see you in a moment.

288
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:06,336
We were just having dinner.
Won't you join us?

289
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,574
That's kind of you,
but I've many things to do around town.

290
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:13,090
You understand, Henry. So many people
making so many mistakes.

291
00:20:13,162 --> 00:20:15,977
- Yes, I see.
- Then we'll see you tomorrow?

292
00:20:16,043 --> 00:20:18,595
- Oh, yes. Bright and early.
- Good.

293
00:20:18,665 --> 00:20:21,000
Whenever you're ready.

294
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:22,975
Good night, Dudley.

295
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:24,904
Good night, Julia.

296
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:33,100
You sure you're an angel?

297
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,975
I know it isn't easy,
but you've got to take me on faith.

298
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:39,457
- But how long will it take?
- Just long enough.

299
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:44,037
Until you can utter another prayer
and say you have no further need of me.

300
00:20:44,105 --> 00:20:47,269
Then I'll be gone
and forgotten.

301
00:20:47,337 --> 00:20:49,956
But Julia's waiting for you
at the dining table.

302
00:20:50,026 --> 00:20:51,881
You must go to her.

303
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,087
But I don't...

304
00:21:40,138 --> 00:21:42,112
What's the rest of Dudley's name?

305
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:46,057
I don't know.

306
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:55,630
Are you nervous, dear?

307
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,353
No.

308
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,604
- The bishop didn't eat his breakfast.
- He took only his prune juice.

309
00:22:17,674 --> 00:22:20,500
What's the matter?
Is he sick?

310
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:24,389
He looked awful. He said he had
a very bad, sleepless night.

311
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:27,010
Passing up a breakfast like that.

312
00:22:27,082 --> 00:22:29,153
That just ain't normal.

313
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:32,641
Nobody expects him to be normal.
He's a bishop.

314
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,811
- If I could get you something, sir?
- No, thank you.

315
00:22:47,882 --> 00:22:50,817
- Maybe just a cup of tea?
- Nothing, thank you.

316
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,606
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Bishop.

317
00:22:56,905 --> 00:22:59,208
Did anything come in
for the cathedral fund?

318
00:22:59,274 --> 00:23:01,892
Mr. And Mrs. Ward,
no contribution.

319
00:23:01,961 --> 00:23:06,948
- Mrs. Wilmark, $15.00.
- We had her down for $10,000.

320
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,190
There's a letter from her explaining
that this year...

321
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:12,073
I know.
Same letter they all write.

322
00:23:12,138 --> 00:23:16,200
I put your personal mail on the desk.
The rest I'm taking to the office.

323
00:23:15,817 --> 00:23:17,542
I'll be there after the meetings.

324
00:23:42,442 --> 00:23:44,930
I think there's someone at the door.

325
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:46,856
Yes, sir.

326
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:51,873
Good morning.
I'm Dudley, the bishop's new assistant.

327
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:53,855
Good morning.
It's a wonderful morning.

328
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,035
I'm a little late,
but I stopped to chat...

329
00:23:56,105 --> 00:23:59,366
with a traffic policeman
who was worried about his wife.

330
00:23:59,433 --> 00:24:01,344
Oh, thank you, dear.

331
00:24:01,418 --> 00:24:03,653
So I directed traffic
while he telephoned the hospital.

332
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,138
- I see.
- She's doing fine. So is the baby.

333
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,985
Why, you must be Mildred Cassaway.
How do you do?

334
00:24:13,097 --> 00:24:15,860
- We're going to be working together.
- That's very nice.

335
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,990
Thank you.

336
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:20,480
- Thank you very much.
- See you later.

337
00:24:22,506 --> 00:24:24,840
Well, ready for duty.

338
00:24:24,905 --> 00:24:26,880
Completely at your service.

339
00:24:35,178 --> 00:24:37,033
- I feel that...
- No.

340
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:42,500
Good morning, Julia.

341
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:44,032
Good morning, Dudley.

342
00:24:44,105 --> 00:24:46,015
A lovely day, isn't it?

343
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,069
- Lovely.
- Henry and I are going out together.

344
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:51,875
- I'm sorry, but I have appointments.
- You what?

345
00:24:51,946 --> 00:24:55,874
I'm seeing Mr. Trevor, then the
board meeting and the junior assembly.

346
00:24:55,946 --> 00:24:58,980
- But you promised.
- I know I did.

347
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,471
Couldn't Dudley represent you
at those meetings?

348
00:25:02,538 --> 00:25:04,546
Could I?

349
00:25:04,617 --> 00:25:08,097
Out of the question. They expect me.
It'd never do if I sent an a...

350
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,025
An assistant.

351
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:13,833
Excuse me.

352
00:25:15,594 --> 00:25:17,121
Now...

353
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:27,580
- The trouble is, I can't explain!
- You needn't try to explain.

354
00:25:26,857 --> 00:25:29,346
This is the way it is
and the way it will always be.

355
00:25:29,418 --> 00:25:31,905
We've just got to get used to it,
that's all.

356
00:25:31,978 --> 00:25:35,490
I'll tell Matilda to take the day off,
and I'll take care of Debby.

357
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:53,288
Mrs. George Hamilton has pledged one
million dollars but hasn't sent a check.

358
00:25:53,354 --> 00:25:56,388
Never mind those cards.
That's work for a bookkeeper, not an a...

359
00:25:56,458 --> 00:26:01,346
- It's work for a bookkeeper.
- So, you're beginning to believe in me.

360
00:26:01,418 --> 00:26:04,167
I don't know who you are
or who it was that sent you.

361
00:26:04,234 --> 00:26:07,048
I'd just wish you'd make haste.
There's no time to lose.

362
00:26:07,114 --> 00:26:08,969
Because the cathedral must be built?

363
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,270
Obviously.
That's the most important thing.

364
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:13,826
Or because Julia must be happy?

365
00:26:13,898 --> 00:26:16,220
It's going to be difficult
to help you...

366
00:26:15,817 --> 00:26:17,890
until I'm sure what it is
you really want.

367
00:26:17,961 --> 00:26:19,817
I've got the...
Then the...

368
00:26:36,617 --> 00:26:39,335
Would you mind telling me
what you intend to do now?

369
00:26:39,401 --> 00:26:43,176
This card index file is an awful mess.
I think I'll reorganize it.

370
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,216
I think you're wasting time
on unimportant details.

371
00:26:45,289 --> 00:26:50,559
Nothing's unimportant. Remember, we're
interested even in the lowliest sparrow.

372
00:27:38,953 --> 00:27:41,538
- Hello, Debby.
- Are you Dudley?

373
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,649
Yes. How did you know?

374
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:47,017
Mummy told me.
She said you came to help Daddy.

375
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,253
That's right.

376
00:27:49,322 --> 00:27:51,427
Mummy said you were very nice.

377
00:27:51,498 --> 00:27:54,051
Well, that's extremely kind
of Mummy.

378
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:58,017
Mummy said that maybe with you here,
we'll get to see Daddy sometimes.

379
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:01,634
- Maybe we will.
- That'll be enough out of you, Debby.

380
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:04,520
I asked Matilda to put your lunch
on a tray for you.

381
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:06,625
Thank you.
I'll get along very well.

382
00:28:06,698 --> 00:28:08,869
I'm sure you will.
Come on, dear.

383
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,687
- Good-bye, Dudley.
- Bye-bye, Debby.

384
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,128
Bye.

385
00:28:58,698 --> 00:29:01,348
- Thank you, Matilda.
- Aren't you going to wear a hat?

386
00:29:01,418 --> 00:29:04,101
- I never use one.
- It's very cold outside.

387
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:08,360
- The cold never effects me.
- I think you should wear this anyway.

388
00:29:08,426 --> 00:29:11,590
I bought it for the bishop
last Christmas.

389
00:29:11,658 --> 00:29:14,658
- But he's never worn it.
- It's a lovely scarf.

390
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,315
I'm sure the bishop will appreciate it
when he sees it on me.

391
00:29:17,385 --> 00:29:19,807
Well, thank you.
Good-bye.

392
00:29:40,938 --> 00:29:43,588
- What's the matter, honey?
- They don't want me.

393
00:29:43,658 --> 00:29:47,302
- Why not?
- I guess I'm too little or something.

394
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,152
Now, now.

395
00:29:50,218 --> 00:29:53,600
Why, that's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

396
00:29:53,673 --> 00:29:54,918
Why, Dudley.

397
00:29:56,074 --> 00:29:59,586
Come on.
We'll show them how wrong they are.

398
00:30:06,186 --> 00:30:07,844
Hey, fellas!

399
00:30:10,026 --> 00:30:12,360
- Who's the head man around here?
- I am!

400
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:18,024
- What's this game you're playing?
- This isn't a game. This is a battle!

401
00:30:18,088 --> 00:30:21,188
We attack the fort
and they try to defend it. See?

402
00:30:21,258 --> 00:30:24,290
I see. Well, this young lady
would like to get into it.

403
00:30:24,361 --> 00:30:27,799
- Her?
- She can't fight. Her father's a bishop.

404
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:31,047
What difference does it make?
Are you high-hat?

405
00:30:31,114 --> 00:30:34,670
- How'd you like her on your team?
- She couldn't throw a snowball...

406
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,900
as far as I could spit!

407
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:41,023
Oh, couldn't she?
Come on.

408
00:30:41,097 --> 00:30:44,643
- You show them what you can do.
- But it's true. I can't throw.

409
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,298
Nonsense. Of course you can.
Here. Pack it tight.

410
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:50,289
Put it in that hand,
throw the arm back...

411
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:51,622
aim it right at him
and let it go!

412
00:30:55,273 --> 00:30:56,963
A bull's-eye!

413
00:30:57,034 --> 00:30:58,976
She pitched a curve!

414
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:01,569
Did you see that?

415
00:31:01,641 --> 00:31:05,438
Come on, kid! You're in our army.
We've broken their moral.

416
00:31:12,616 --> 00:31:15,301
- You think she'll get hurt?
- Probably, but she'll love it.

417
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:17,225
- May I?
- Surely.

418
00:31:21,226 --> 00:31:23,200
What are you doing out here?

419
00:31:23,273 --> 00:31:27,430
- Just admiring the scenery.
- Aren't you supposed to be working?

420
00:31:27,498 --> 00:31:31,426
I always take a walk before lunch.
Good idea... relaxing.

421
00:31:32,905 --> 00:31:36,321
- I wish you'd persuade Henry to do that.
- I'll try.

422
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,631
By the way, I told Miss Cassaway
to go home...

423
00:31:38,698 --> 00:31:41,513
and I told Delia
not to bring me anything on the tray.

424
00:31:41,577 --> 00:31:44,033
What will you do about lunch?

425
00:31:44,105 --> 00:31:47,073
I thought I'd go to Michel's.
Ever heard of it?

426
00:31:47,145 --> 00:31:50,495
Michel's?
It's a lovely place.

427
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:52,937
We used to go there
years ago.

428
00:31:53,001 --> 00:31:56,067
How about you and I
going there today?

429
00:31:56,138 --> 00:31:59,302
You and... To Mich...
No, I couldn't.

430
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:02,403
Why not? Surely, you don't think
Henry would mind?

431
00:32:02,472 --> 00:32:05,058
- I'd explain to him it'd be just...
- No, it isn't that.

432
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:08,904
Matilda's off Christmas shopping
so I have to look after Debby.

433
00:32:10,986 --> 00:32:12,894
Here's Matilda now.

434
00:32:17,514 --> 00:32:19,903
- If you wish... Oh, hello.
- Hello.

435
00:32:19,978 --> 00:32:21,920
If you wish,
I'll take Debby home.

436
00:32:21,992 --> 00:32:24,677
- But your shopping.
- I finished it.

437
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,429
I finished it so quick,
it was just like miracle.

438
00:32:27,497 --> 00:32:28,959
Mommy!

439
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:31,619
- We won!
- That's wonderful!

440
00:32:31,689 --> 00:32:34,077
Congratulations!

441
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:36,641
Come on!
We're giving out the medals!

442
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,559
Put up your hood, dear.

443
00:32:52,489 --> 00:32:54,628
- Oh, Michel.
- It's been a long time.

444
00:32:54,698 --> 00:32:57,065
Much too long. But you know
my husbanïs work.

445
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,130
Yes, your husband.
He doesn't come to see us anymore.

446
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:02,951
But we understand.
We understand.

447
00:33:03,017 --> 00:33:04,872
This way please.

448
00:33:09,576 --> 00:33:11,138
Is this satisfactory?

449
00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:14,405
Fine, thank you.

450
00:33:14,472 --> 00:33:17,120
- Friends of yours?
- Yes.

451
00:33:16,808 --> 00:33:19,394
That is, they're members
of the cathedral committee.

452
00:33:19,466 --> 00:33:20,676
- Madame.
- Thank you.

453
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,371
- Monsieur?
- No, thank you.

454
00:33:22,442 --> 00:33:24,415
Julia, don't bother with that.

455
00:33:24,489 --> 00:33:27,304
Michel, you just bring us
the best lunch you can think of.

456
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:30,980
I can see monsieur is a gourmet.
Perhaps you'd be interested in...

457
00:33:31,048 --> 00:33:32,576
Guinea Hen a lá Michel?

458
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:41,992
Please.
Let's leave heaven out of this.

459
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:51,016
You speak French beautifully.

460
00:33:51,082 --> 00:33:52,936
I've had quite a bit of work
to do in Paris.

461
00:33:55,657 --> 00:33:58,078
I've been wondering about you.

462
00:33:58,153 --> 00:34:01,317
- Wondering about me? Why?
- You know so much.

463
00:34:01,385 --> 00:34:04,997
- It makes me feel uncomfortable.
- Then I'm sorry I learned anything.

464
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,828
I'm glad you knew about Michel.

465
00:34:09,897 --> 00:34:12,963
Oh, it's so nice
to be back here again.

466
00:34:13,033 --> 00:34:17,223
- So nice.
- You have memories of this place?

467
00:34:18,218 --> 00:34:20,519
Did you and Henry
come here often?

468
00:34:20,585 --> 00:34:24,263
As a matter of fact, this is where
we became engaged to be married.

469
00:34:25,546 --> 00:34:28,800
Then I can understand
why you love it.

470
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,544
- Pardon me.
- Thank you.

471
00:34:33,609 --> 00:34:36,293
Well, what about that?

472
00:34:36,362 --> 00:34:39,329
My. Would you care to have
your palm read?

473
00:34:39,401 --> 00:34:41,954
No, thank you.
Would you?

474
00:34:42,026 --> 00:34:44,677
No, thanks. I know too much about myself
as it is.

475
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,648
You are different.
I know so little about myself.

476
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,471
Really?
May I look at your hand?

477
00:34:50,537 --> 00:34:53,025
- Can you do that too?
- It's not too difficult.

478
00:34:53,097 --> 00:34:55,814
- I suppose you can read the future.
- Within limits.

479
00:34:56,874 --> 00:34:59,208
He's holding her hand.

480
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:02,175
What do you see?

481
00:35:03,209 --> 00:35:06,111
I never noticed.
Your eyes are green.

482
00:35:08,265 --> 00:35:12,902
I see a great deal of happiness.
I see a woman who's adored.

483
00:35:12,969 --> 00:35:16,166
I see a rich, full life.

484
00:35:16,234 --> 00:35:18,917
- Do you see Henry's new cathedral?
- It's not very clear.

485
00:35:18,985 --> 00:35:21,090
There's kind of a fuzziness
about that.

486
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:23,365
- And Debby?
- No need to worry about her.

487
00:35:24,841 --> 00:35:29,031
Just think. The world changes,
but two things remain constant.

488
00:35:29,097 --> 00:35:32,294
- What?
- Youth and beauty.

489
00:35:32,361 --> 00:35:35,530
Though they're really
one in the same thing.

490
00:35:34,857 --> 00:35:39,462
- Yes. The trouble is, people grow old.
- Not everybody.

491
00:35:39,529 --> 00:35:42,944
The only people who grow old
were born old to begin with.

492
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:45,156
You were born young.
You'll remain that way.

493
00:35:47,081 --> 00:35:50,115
- I wish I could believe.
- You may.

494
00:35:52,298 --> 00:35:54,818
You haven't looked at my hand once.

495
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:58,850
I never know what to think. I never know
if you're joking or serious.

496
00:35:58,922 --> 00:36:01,921
I'm at my most serious
when I'm joking.

497
00:36:07,017 --> 00:36:09,505
Excuse me.
I've gotta do something about that.

498
00:36:12,106 --> 00:36:14,658
Forgive me coming to your table, ladies.
I'm Dudley.

499
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,407
I believe you're friends of Julia's.
Would you care to join us for lunch?

500
00:36:18,473 --> 00:36:22,303
- No, thank you.
- Why don't you join us for some coffee?

501
00:36:22,377 --> 00:36:25,672
Do come over.
Julia will be delighted.

502
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,104
Wonderful.

503
00:36:28,169 --> 00:36:30,000
Just over there.

504
00:36:33,545 --> 00:36:35,301
How are you?
Nice to see you.

505
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,983
Michel, bring us three Benedictines.

506
00:36:42,057 --> 00:36:44,610
No. Make it three Stingers.

507
00:36:44,681 --> 00:36:46,340
Stingers?
Oui, monsieur.

508
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:03,300
- Is lunch ready?
- We thought you were out for lunch.

509
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:06,280
I cancelled my appointment.
Are my wife and Debby home?

510
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:08,582
- Debby's here, sir.
- Where is Mrs. Brougham?

511
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:11,137
She went out to lunch
with Mr. Dudley.

512
00:37:13,033 --> 00:37:16,165
- With Dudley?
- Why, yes, sir.

513
00:37:16,873 --> 00:37:19,590
I thought you knew, sir.

514
00:37:19,658 --> 00:37:21,513
Yes. Of course.

515
00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:40,254
That's awful.
Merry Christmas, Santa.

516
00:37:41,353 --> 00:37:43,295
Santa Claus doesn't really
look like that.

517
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:46,086
- You know Santa Claus?
- I've known him for years.

518
00:37:46,153 --> 00:37:49,000
- Nice chap.
- You must tell Debby about him.

519
00:37:49,065 --> 00:37:52,065
She's just beginning
to be a little bit doubtful.

520
00:37:57,193 --> 00:38:00,041
- You like that hat.
- Yes. I'm crazy about it.

521
00:38:01,161 --> 00:38:04,641
- Let's go in and buy it.
- No, I couldn't.

522
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:07,015
- It's much too...
- Too what? Attractive?

523
00:38:07,081 --> 00:38:10,693
Nothing could be...
Why! My old friend, the professor.

524
00:38:12,393 --> 00:38:15,012
- Are you with this man?
- Of course. It's Dudley.

525
00:38:15,081 --> 00:38:17,318
The professor knows me from
the University of Vienna.

526
00:38:17,385 --> 00:38:19,392
I've been thinking about that.

527
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:22,370
I don't believe
you've ever been to Vienna.

528
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:24,321
It's a game we play.
He pretends he's never seen me before.

529
00:38:24,394 --> 00:38:26,914
I don't know who he is,
but I don't trust him.

530
00:38:26,985 --> 00:38:29,287
He's Henry's new assistant.

531
00:38:30,537 --> 00:38:32,676
- You mean, you know this fella?
- Of course, I do.

532
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:37,317
In that case, how about dropping by
for some yuletide cheer?

533
00:38:37,385 --> 00:38:39,294
No. I have to go home.
L...

534
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:43,941
- Well, perhaps just for a few minutes.
- Good! Come along.

535
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:55,010
There's a little sherry left...
a rather inferior grade, but potable.

536
00:38:55,081 --> 00:38:58,659
- I see you're quite a religious man.
- What makes you think that?

537
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:03,250
- You have an angel on your tree.
- Julia gave me that years ago.

538
00:39:02,825 --> 00:39:05,891
- Your tree is beautiful.
- It's disgraceful.

539
00:39:05,961 --> 00:39:10,610
But it gives me the illusion
of peace on earth, goodwill toward men.

540
00:39:09,866 --> 00:39:12,583
- To a charming lady.
- Lovely.

541
00:39:12,649 --> 00:39:15,398
- You've noticed?
- It's more remarkable that you have.

542
00:39:15,465 --> 00:39:20,386
When you want to know about a woman,
ask the old men. They know.

543
00:39:23,273 --> 00:39:26,622
Will you show us the manuscript
of your book?

544
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,420
- My book?
- Please.

545
00:39:28,489 --> 00:39:31,610
- Oh, no.
- You're writing one?

546
00:39:35,337 --> 00:39:38,915
- You didn't know?
- You didn't tell me.

547
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:43,971
I described that book in detail
at the University of Vienna.

548
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:46,081
All my pupils knew.

549
00:39:46,153 --> 00:39:48,804
Now I'm certain
this fellow's an impostor.

550
00:39:48,874 --> 00:39:51,623
Oh, that book.
I thought you finished that years ago.

551
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,478
I'll tell you...

552
00:39:53,545 --> 00:39:55,520
I'll tell you about my book.

553
00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:58,670
For 20 years I've talked about it.

554
00:39:57,866 --> 00:40:01,411
I promised publishers that
it would be delivered next spring.

555
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:04,547
Funny part is, in all that time,
I haven't written one word.

556
00:40:04,617 --> 00:40:07,580
- Not one word.
- Why not?

557
00:40:06,857 --> 00:40:09,094
I couldn't think
of anything original to say.

558
00:40:09,161 --> 00:40:13,351
The same, old, monotonous history,
dry as dust.

559
00:40:15,977 --> 00:40:18,030
That's the whole story of my life.

560
00:40:17,801 --> 00:40:21,379
Frustration.
It's a chronic disease...

561
00:40:21,449 --> 00:40:23,457
and it's incurable.

562
00:40:25,129 --> 00:40:27,017
Once, I was madly...

563
00:40:34,346 --> 00:40:36,833
Once, I was madly in love
with a girl.

564
00:40:37,897 --> 00:40:41,988
My friends, she was a vision
of delight. A pure enchantress.

565
00:40:42,057 --> 00:40:44,927
- You never told me about that.
- That's just the trouble.

566
00:40:45,002 --> 00:40:47,238
I never told her about it either.

567
00:40:47,305 --> 00:40:49,574
I couldn't find the words.

568
00:40:49,641 --> 00:40:52,227
So, she married an athlete.

569
00:40:52,297 --> 00:40:56,574
A great hulky oaf
who never even reached the eighth grade.

570
00:40:57,609 --> 00:41:00,456
But he knew how to say
I love you.

571
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,568
Same trouble as my book.
Can't find the words.

572
00:41:08,297 --> 00:41:10,981
Even when you had this coin
to inspire you?

573
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:15,588
Why, that's the one
you gave to Henry.

574
00:41:15,657 --> 00:41:18,308
Yes. I stole it off the table.

575
00:41:18,377 --> 00:41:20,352
You wasted your time.
It's worthless.

576
00:41:20,426 --> 00:41:24,616
On the contrary. This is one of
the rarest of all antiquities.

577
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:28,958
Only 100 of these were minted
by Julius Caesar 2,000 years ago.

578
00:41:29,033 --> 00:41:31,171
That was when Cleopatra
visited Rome.

579
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:34,175
Presumably, these were used
to pay her hotel bill.

580
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:38,624
- I never knew that.
- Nobody did, except Caesar's wife.

581
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:41,283
- And she was suspicious.
- Definitely.

582
00:41:41,353 --> 00:41:45,215
She didn't share
her husbanïs admiration for Cleopatra.

583
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:48,867
So she had these coins destroyed...
melted into ornaments for herself.

584
00:41:48,937 --> 00:41:50,977
This is the one she missed.

585
00:41:51,048 --> 00:41:53,023
It's a unwritten chapter in history.

586
00:41:53,097 --> 00:41:55,585
And you will write it.

587
00:41:56,649 --> 00:41:58,504
Do you know any more stories
like that?

588
00:41:58,569 --> 00:42:00,260
Any number of them.

589
00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:02,239
You're a curious fellow.

590
00:42:02,314 --> 00:42:04,615
Have you just begun to notice that?

591
00:42:04,681 --> 00:42:07,267
What's your background?

592
00:42:07,337 --> 00:42:11,265
- My background?
- Well, where do you come from?

593
00:42:11,337 --> 00:42:13,541
- Well...
- Don't tell me any more about Vienna.

594
00:42:13,609 --> 00:42:16,129
- Because I won't believe it.
- All right.

595
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:19,169
Would you believe me if I told you
I came from another planet?

596
00:42:19,241 --> 00:42:21,379
I don't know.

597
00:42:21,449 --> 00:42:22,693
I'd believe you.

598
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,965
And you'd be right, Julia,
as always.

599
00:42:25,033 --> 00:42:27,040
We all come from
our own little planets.

600
00:42:27,113 --> 00:42:30,888
That's why we're all different.
That's what makes life interesting.

601
00:42:45,097 --> 00:42:47,366
We don't seem
to be making any headway.

602
00:42:49,289 --> 00:42:53,100
First star I see tonight...

603
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:55,304
You must make a wish.

604
00:42:57,417 --> 00:43:00,167
It's getting dark.
It must be late.

605
00:43:00,233 --> 00:43:02,240
Henry will be worried.
We must be leaving.

606
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:05,542
- Oh, no.
- I'm sorry, but we must.

607
00:43:08,137 --> 00:43:11,007
- Yes, my friend.
- There's one thing that troubles me.

608
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,469
- One thing I wish I knew.
- What's that?

609
00:43:13,545 --> 00:43:17,123
I'm an old man and that history's
a tremendous task.

610
00:43:17,193 --> 00:43:21,023
I wonder.
Will I have time to finish it?

611
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:24,926
You'll finish your history.
You'll have time.

612
00:43:26,088 --> 00:43:27,943
I believe you.

613
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:32,671
For a while now,
every time I passed a cemetery...

614
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,298
I felt as if I were
apartment hunting.

615
00:43:38,377 --> 00:43:40,384
Good-bye, Professor.

616
00:43:40,457 --> 00:43:42,529
You've given an old man
a very happy afternoon.

617
00:43:42,601 --> 00:43:45,089
- Thank you.
- God bless you both.

618
00:43:45,161 --> 00:43:49,400
Thank you.
I'll pass that recommendation along.

619
00:44:39,017 --> 00:44:41,024
Oh, my.
That's pretty.

620
00:44:41,097 --> 00:44:45,669
Why don't you take some of that
pink stuff and make curly-cues with it?

621
00:44:46,697 --> 00:44:48,900
- I hope the dinner won't be spoiled.
- No, sir.

622
00:44:48,969 --> 00:44:52,384
I had a feeling
that they might be late.

623
00:44:52,457 --> 00:44:55,107
Very considerate of you.
Who's that cake for?

624
00:44:55,177 --> 00:44:57,478
- What cake?
- The cake behind you.

625
00:44:58,665 --> 00:45:02,145
That cake? Oh, for anybody
who might like cake.

626
00:45:02,217 --> 00:45:05,479
But you know very well
we don't like these elaborate desserts.

627
00:45:05,545 --> 00:45:08,447
But we baked you an egg custard, sir.

628
00:45:16,617 --> 00:45:19,551
Hello, dear.
I'm sorry we're late for dinner.

629
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:22,308
- Good evening.
- We've had the most marvelous time.

630
00:45:22,377 --> 00:45:24,515
- I wish you'd been with us.
- I wish I had.

631
00:45:24,585 --> 00:45:26,951
- Debby told me about the snow fights.
- Did she?

632
00:45:27,017 --> 00:45:31,290
We sent to see Professor Wutheridge
and then had lunch at Michel's.

633
00:45:30,825 --> 00:45:33,040
- Is Debby in bed yet?
- She's waiting to see you.

634
00:45:32,808 --> 00:45:35,656
Good. I'll go up
and say good night.

635
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:38,590
I won't be long.
I'll just see if she's all right.

636
00:45:42,377 --> 00:45:44,351
I trust you spent
a profitable afternoon?

637
00:45:44,425 --> 00:45:48,287
Oh, yes.
Did you have a profitable afternoon?

638
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:53,182
Not very.
I'd like to see you...

639
00:45:54,217 --> 00:45:55,624
for a moment.

640
00:45:55,689 --> 00:45:57,544
Certainly.

641
00:46:00,648 --> 00:46:02,503
Excuse me.

642
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,944
Can you prove to me
that you are an angel?

643
00:46:15,017 --> 00:46:17,024
Proof?
You mean an document?

644
00:46:17,097 --> 00:46:21,352
You, of all people should know
that an angel needs no passport.

645
00:46:21,416 --> 00:46:23,871
I want to see you perform a miracle.

646
00:46:23,944 --> 00:46:28,003
- What kind?
- Make the desk fly around the room.

647
00:46:28,073 --> 00:46:30,561
Please! I didn't come down here
to do silly tricks.

648
00:46:30,633 --> 00:46:34,178
- I'm surprised at you.
- I don't believe you're an angel.

649
00:46:34,248 --> 00:46:37,060
I think you're a demon right out of...

650
00:46:36,809 --> 00:46:39,297
Oh, Henry! Don't say that.

651
00:46:40,809 --> 00:46:43,540
Well, anyway.
You know how I feel.

652
00:46:42,856 --> 00:46:45,344
Yes.

653
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:48,515
Wait a minute.
There's another thing.

654
00:47:28,232 --> 00:47:30,534
Dinner is served, Bishop.

655
00:47:49,896 --> 00:47:52,210
Thank you.

656
00:47:55,177 --> 00:48:00,611
For what we are about to receive, may
the Lord make us truly thankful. Amen.

657
00:48:12,648 --> 00:48:14,853
Pass the celery, Henry.
Please.

658
00:48:15,881 --> 00:48:18,050
The celery.

659
00:48:24,137 --> 00:48:25,992
Thank you.

660
00:48:53,448 --> 00:48:55,870
What's that you're humming?

661
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:58,534
I don't know, dear.
Is it anything?

662
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,088
- It's rather gay.
- I feel gay.

663
00:49:07,209 --> 00:49:09,412
I like to watch you
brushing your hair.

664
00:49:10,665 --> 00:49:13,283
Thank you, dear.
Is that a compliment?

665
00:49:13,353 --> 00:49:15,873
Yes. You do it so capably.

666
00:49:17,129 --> 00:49:18,983
Well, thank you.

667
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:24,648
In fact, now that I think of it...

668
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:26,900
everything you do is capable.

669
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:32,837
The one thing I pride myself on is that
we lead a well-ordered life.

670
00:49:32,905 --> 00:49:34,399
The family, I mean.

671
00:49:34,473 --> 00:49:38,590
Of course, that's due to you
much more than me.

672
00:49:38,984 --> 00:49:41,537
- I think you're an excellent wife.
- Thank you.

673
00:49:42,824 --> 00:49:45,672
- Do you think I'm an excellent husband?
- Of course.

674
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:48,868
We're having supper early
so we can get to St. Timothy's on time.

675
00:49:48,936 --> 00:49:52,210
- St. Timothy's?
- Choir rehearsal for the benefit.

676
00:49:51,816 --> 00:49:56,470
- Oh, yes.
- You've been looking very tired lately.

677
00:49:55,848 --> 00:49:59,110
I hope you'll take it easier
now that Dudley's here.

678
00:49:59,177 --> 00:50:02,439
- I think that he's very able.
- You do?

679
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:07,909
- He knows so many things.
- What, for instance?

680
00:50:07,976 --> 00:50:10,496
You should have seen him
with Professor Wutheridge.

681
00:50:10,568 --> 00:50:13,121
He knows more about history
than the professor.

682
00:50:13,192 --> 00:50:16,007
He'd been at it longer.

683
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,204
- Let's do that again.
- No! Tell me a story.

684
00:50:31,272 --> 00:50:33,509
- Now?
- Don't you know any stories?

685
00:50:33,577 --> 00:50:36,806
- I know hundreds of stories.
- Tell me one. Please!

686
00:50:36,873 --> 00:50:39,044
All right.
Let me think.

687
00:50:39,112 --> 00:50:41,119
Now this happened
many, many years ago.

688
00:50:41,192 --> 00:50:43,461
That's not the way to begin.

689
00:50:43,529 --> 00:50:45,536
Stories start, "Once upon a time."

690
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:48,478
Yes, that's true.
Well, once upon a time...

691
00:50:48,552 --> 00:50:51,040
there was a little boy
who lived in a little town.

692
00:50:51,113 --> 00:50:53,382
- What was his name?
- His name was David.

693
00:50:53,448 --> 00:50:56,612
He was a shepherd and the town
where he lived was called Bethlehem.

694
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,680
I know Bethlehem.
That's where the star was.

695
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:03,560
That's right.
Only, David lived long before the star.

696
00:51:02,856 --> 00:51:06,280
One night, he was out in the hills
tending his sheep.

697
00:51:05,832 --> 00:51:11,331
- He was playing the harp and singing.
- Was he singing "Jingle Bells"?

698
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,255
"Jingle Bells" hadn't
been written then.

699
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,120
He was singing songs
he wrote himself.

700
00:51:15,816 --> 00:51:18,981
Suddenly, an angel came down
and spoke to David.

701
00:51:19,049 --> 00:51:22,344
- How did David know it was an angel?
- He didn't know.

702
00:51:22,408 --> 00:51:24,263
You know, that's the way
it always is.

703
00:51:24,328 --> 00:51:26,695
Angels come and put ideas
into peoples' heads.

704
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,615
Then people feel proud of themselves...

705
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,550
because they think it was
all their own idea.

706
00:51:30,856 --> 00:51:33,223
This angel said to David...

707
00:51:33,288 --> 00:51:35,394
"One of your lambs has strayed."

708
00:51:35,464 --> 00:51:39,425
David put aside his harp and went
into the darkness to find his lamb.

709
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:41,318
Of course, the angel guided him.

710
00:51:41,385 --> 00:51:46,622
When David found the lamb,
he saw a great, big, ferocious lion.

711
00:51:46,697 --> 00:51:47,973
Oh!

712
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,269
David said to the lion,
"You get away from that lamb!"

713
00:51:51,336 --> 00:51:54,915
And the lion said,
"Get away from me or I'll eat you too!"

714
00:51:54,985 --> 00:51:58,280
- Did David run away?
- No. You know why?

715
00:51:58,345 --> 00:52:00,832
Because the angel put another idea
into his head.

716
00:52:00,904 --> 00:52:03,806
David took out his sling
and he hurled his stone...

717
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,051
and hit the lion
right between the eyes.

718
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,186
I bet that lion was surprised!

719
00:52:09,256 --> 00:52:13,070
And so was David. Because he didn't know
an angel had helped him.

720
00:52:12,808 --> 00:52:15,842
Well, he picked up the lamb
and took it back to the fold.

721
00:52:15,912 --> 00:52:19,108
He felt so happy,
he made up another song.

722
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:24,326
It started out, "The Lord
is my shepherd, I shall not want.

723
00:52:24,393 --> 00:52:26,978
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures:

724
00:52:27,048 --> 00:52:30,082
"He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

725
00:52:31,016 --> 00:52:33,155
"He restoreth my soul."

726
00:52:34,504 --> 00:52:38,595
- You can tell the rest of this, Henry.
- Some other time.

727
00:52:38,664 --> 00:52:40,519
Hello, Daddy.

728
00:52:41,832 --> 00:52:45,345
Miss Cassaway, please get
Mrs. Hamilton on the telephone.

729
00:52:46,665 --> 00:52:51,580
- Get Mrs. Hamilton on the phone, please!
- Yes, Bishop.

730
00:52:51,816 --> 00:52:53,955
- Good morning, Julia.
- Good morning.

731
00:52:54,024 --> 00:52:56,839
I'll see you in a minute.
I have to see Matilda now.

732
00:52:56,904 --> 00:52:58,879
- Bye, Debby.
- Good-bye, Dudley.

733
00:53:07,949 --> 00:53:10,316
- Thank you.
- Oh, pretty.

734
00:53:12,238 --> 00:53:15,053
- Are you expecting a letter?
- One never knows.

735
00:53:15,118 --> 00:53:17,965
But if I should get one,
the stamp would be worth saving.

736
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:21,826
- I have Mrs. Hamilton in a moment, sir.
- Are you seeing her today?

737
00:53:21,901 --> 00:53:24,356
- I hope to.
- May I come along? I'd like to meet her.

738
00:53:30,381 --> 00:53:33,350
Hello, Mrs. Hamilton.
How are you?

739
00:53:32,654 --> 00:53:36,680
I'm glad to hear it.
I'd like to see you today.

740
00:53:36,749 --> 00:53:39,171
This afternoon, if possible.

741
00:53:39,245 --> 00:53:41,449
Yes, it is.
It's very urgent.

742
00:53:42,958 --> 00:53:45,740
- That's too bad.
- That's terrible.

743
00:53:47,246 --> 00:53:49,188
You can?
That's splendid.

744
00:53:50,222 --> 00:53:52,491
Thank you so much.
I'll be there.

745
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,006
5:00 this evening.
Thank you. Good-bye.

746
00:53:56,077 --> 00:53:59,045
You didn't make an appointment
for this afternoon, did you?

747
00:53:59,118 --> 00:54:03,150
- It was the only possible time.
- You can't do this to Reverend Miller.

748
00:54:02,637 --> 00:54:04,612
That rehearsal's being held
just for you.

749
00:54:04,686 --> 00:54:08,298
They'll get along without me, and
there are other things more important.

750
00:54:08,366 --> 00:54:13,221
- He'll be delighted to see you.
- It isn't the same. You're his bishop.

751
00:54:13,293 --> 00:54:15,148
I don't like going alone.

752
00:54:30,829 --> 00:54:33,317
It's the big house
at the end of this street, Driver.

753
00:54:34,317 --> 00:54:36,805
Dudley, I take it that...

754
00:54:36,877 --> 00:54:41,360
that you have the money for the taxi?

755
00:54:40,654 --> 00:54:43,752
No. What makes you think
I have money?

756
00:54:43,821 --> 00:54:47,170
I just thought that,
you being an ang...

757
00:54:47,245 --> 00:54:48,969
Goodness!

758
00:54:49,998 --> 00:54:52,169
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

759
00:55:02,317 --> 00:55:04,172
Thank you.

760
00:55:10,701 --> 00:55:13,036
I may be in time to join you
before too long.

761
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,370
- Please try.
- I'll see you in front of the church...

762
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,320
in exactly one hour.

763
00:55:16,653 --> 00:55:19,370
- Try.
- I will be there.

764
00:55:19,437 --> 00:55:22,121
- Good.
- This is it, Driver.

765
00:55:42,765 --> 00:55:45,640
- Good evening, Bishop Brougham.
- How are you, Stevens?

766
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,037
Mrs. Hamilton is
in the drawing room, sir.

767
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:49,964
Thank you.

768
00:55:57,614 --> 00:55:59,468
Well, Bishop Brougham.

769
00:56:00,846 --> 00:56:03,115
My dear Mrs. Hamilton,
I've come to tell you...

770
00:56:03,181 --> 00:56:05,898
- You've come to apologize, I trust.
- Exactly.

771
00:56:05,965 --> 00:56:08,812
Upon mature consideration,
my objections seem petty...

772
00:56:08,878 --> 00:56:10,950
compared with your generous gesture.

773
00:56:11,021 --> 00:56:14,055
- I'm very relieved. Sit down, Bishop.
- Thank you.

774
00:56:14,126 --> 00:56:17,159
What hurt me most was to think
that my instinct had betrayed me...

775
00:56:17,229 --> 00:56:19,880
in recommending you
for the position you now hold.

776
00:56:19,949 --> 00:56:21,804
I am unceasingly grateful.

777
00:56:21,869 --> 00:56:24,967
Now, in planning the cathedral
I'm taking it for granted...

778
00:56:25,037 --> 00:56:27,907
that the George B. Hamilton
Memorial Chapel shall be located...

779
00:56:27,981 --> 00:56:30,053
Just where you specified, Mrs. Hamilton.

780
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:31,980
You don't feel
the effect will be lost...

781
00:56:32,045 --> 00:56:34,347
if the whole cathedral
was built in my husbanïs honor?

782
00:56:34,413 --> 00:56:37,861
I said that in the heat of a dispute.
What matters is that it be built.

783
00:56:37,934 --> 00:56:42,723
Good. I will not have his name
in some horrid little brass plaque.

784
00:56:42,797 --> 00:56:45,764
No, it will be in marble
with large, gilded letters.

785
00:56:45,837 --> 00:56:48,652
Now, the large window depicting
St. George and the dragon.

786
00:56:49,645 --> 00:56:53,769
I should like St. George's countenance
suggest my late husbanïs.

787
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:56,839
And the dragon?

788
00:56:57,869 --> 00:57:01,066
Any dragon.
Let's get the blueprints.

789
00:57:01,773 --> 00:57:04,162
Mrs. Hamilton, since we're now
in agreement...

790
00:57:04,237 --> 00:57:07,019
would you mind if we postpone
the discussion of the details?

791
00:57:07,086 --> 00:57:10,230
- Julia's waiting at St. Timothy's.
- Very well.

792
00:57:09,645 --> 00:57:12,263
We can go over the plans
when we send for the funds.

793
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:14,984
Thank you. I'm glad we've settled
our differences.

794
00:57:20,174 --> 00:57:22,028
Is anything the matter?

795
00:57:22,094 --> 00:57:23,948
It doesn't seem quite right.

796
00:57:26,957 --> 00:57:28,167
Stevens!

797
00:57:28,237 --> 00:57:30,823
There's something wrong
about the bishop's chair.

798
00:57:32,813 --> 00:57:35,234
Madame, it must be the new varnish.

799
00:57:35,309 --> 00:57:37,219
The finisher should have warned us.

800
00:57:39,053 --> 00:57:41,955
- I hope I'm not harming the chair.
- Not at all.

801
00:57:42,029 --> 00:57:45,444
Call a furniture shop or a plumber.

802
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,459
- Turpentine. Do something, Stevens.
- Yes, ma'am.

803
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:50,664
- Oh, dear.
- I wonder...

804
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:52,741
Will you give it a little pull
at the back?

805
00:58:05,165 --> 00:58:06,442
Thank you.

806
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,810
"Benefit. Help Save St. Timothy's"

807
00:58:08,878 --> 00:58:11,780
It's been a long time
since Henry's been here.

808
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:13,736
I wish he had come.

809
00:58:13,805 --> 00:58:17,253
When he was here,
he was so close to people.

810
00:58:17,325 --> 00:58:19,180
So loved by everybody.

811
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:21,350
How does it seem now?

812
00:58:21,421 --> 00:58:24,690
That the cathedral has moved him away
from the people he loved?

813
00:58:27,149 --> 00:58:29,637
Reverend Miller will be disappointed
not to see him.

814
00:58:29,709 --> 00:58:32,140
He doesn't have to be.

815
00:58:35,117 --> 00:58:37,735
- Hello, Mr. Miller.
- So good of you to come, Mrs. Brougham.

816
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,496
I'm delighted to be here.

817
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,452
This is Mr. Dudley,
the bishop's new assistant.

818
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:43,689
- A pleasure.
- Thank you.

819
00:58:43,757 --> 00:58:47,205
The bishop will try to get here later.
Something important came up.

820
00:58:47,277 --> 00:58:50,180
Oh. Of course, he's a busy man.

821
00:58:51,885 --> 00:58:54,602
- This is Mrs. Duffy.
- I know her. How are you?

822
00:58:54,669 --> 00:58:56,938
It's always an honor to have you here
at St. Timothy's.

823
00:58:57,005 --> 00:58:59,110
Thank you. This is Mr. Dudley.

824
00:58:59,181 --> 00:59:00,730
Mrs. Duffy is the organist.

825
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:03,905
I'm sure she plays enchantingly.
Hello, Mrs. Duffy.

826
00:59:03,981 --> 00:59:06,600
I'm afraid some of our boys
are a little late.

827
00:59:08,077 --> 00:59:11,012
We should begin but
I don't see how we can.

828
00:59:11,085 --> 00:59:13,125
It's quite embarrassing.

829
00:59:13,197 --> 00:59:18,053
It is a little difficult to compete
with basketball and Christmas.

830
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:20,808
- They're all good boys at heart.
- I know.

831
00:59:20,877 --> 00:59:22,917
- They'll show up.
- I hope so.

832
00:59:24,493 --> 00:59:26,380
- Hello, Bobby.
- Hello.

833
00:59:27,245 --> 00:59:29,634
- What do you sing?
- First soprano.

834
00:59:29,709 --> 00:59:32,076
- Are you good?
- I don't know.

835
00:59:32,141 --> 00:59:34,629
- How about giving a...
- Me alone?

836
00:59:34,701 --> 00:59:37,865
- You've got George. Hello, George.
- Hello.

837
00:59:37,933 --> 00:59:39,940
- What do you say?
- Okay.

838
00:59:41,229 --> 00:59:42,920
- Are you ready, Mrs. Duffy?
- Oh, yes.

839
00:59:42,989 --> 00:59:44,363
Hit it.

840
00:59:47,117 --> 00:59:49,986
O sing to God

841
00:59:50,061 --> 00:59:53,127
Your hymns of gladness

842
00:59:53,197 --> 00:59:55,052
Ye loving hearts

843
00:59:55,117 --> 00:59:57,637
Your tribute make

844
00:59:57,709 --> 01:00:02,947
Your Lord is born this happy day

845
01:00:03,021 --> 01:00:08,171
Then pierce the sky
with songs of gladness

846
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:12,361
Disperse the chains
of gloom and sadness

847
01:00:12,429 --> 01:00:14,949
The Lord is born

848
01:00:15,021 --> 01:00:17,355
This happy day

849
01:00:17,421 --> 01:00:19,275
O Sing to Him

850
01:00:19,341 --> 01:00:22,243
Your hymns of gladness

851
01:00:22,317 --> 01:00:25,285
O sing to God

852
01:00:25,357 --> 01:00:28,204
Your hymns of gladness

853
01:00:28,269 --> 01:00:32,612
Ye loving hearts your tribute make

854
01:00:32,685 --> 01:00:35,052
Your Lord is born

855
01:00:35,117 --> 01:00:38,084
This happy day

856
01:00:38,157 --> 01:00:43,045
Then pierce the sky
with songs of gladness

857
01:00:43,117 --> 01:00:47,460
Disperse the shades
of gloom and sadness

858
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:49,802
Your Lord is born

859
01:00:49,869 --> 01:00:52,356
This happy day

860
01:00:52,429 --> 01:00:54,371
O sing full out

861
01:00:54,445 --> 01:00:57,860
Your hymns of gladness

862
01:00:57,933 --> 01:01:00,690
O Word of God

863
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:03,436
For us incarnate

864
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,606
O Word of God

865
01:01:05,677 --> 01:01:08,775
For us incarnate

866
01:01:08,845 --> 01:01:13,155
By faith we hear Thine angels sing

867
01:01:18,285 --> 01:01:22,082
- Their hymns
- Angels sing their hymns

868
01:01:22,157 --> 01:01:25,890
Of praise to Thee their King

869
01:01:25,613 --> 01:01:30,348
We join with them in adoration

870
01:01:35,788 --> 01:01:40,130
We pour
We pour to Thee

871
01:01:39,628 --> 01:01:43,273
Our supplication

872
01:01:43,341 --> 01:01:45,829
That Thou wouldst

873
01:01:45,901 --> 01:01:49,097
Grant us Lord

874
01:01:49,165 --> 01:01:54,828
Salvation

875
01:02:02,893 --> 01:02:05,413
Boys, that was beautiful.

876
01:02:05,485 --> 01:02:07,340
Really beautiful.

877
01:02:07,789 --> 01:02:12,229
You've all grown up so since
the bishop and I lived in this parish.

878
01:02:12,301 --> 01:02:15,051
I hardly recognized any of you.

879
01:02:15,117 --> 01:02:17,004
I'm so proud of you.

880
01:02:17,068 --> 01:02:19,272
I know he will be to.

881
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:21,195
Thank you.

882
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:23,790
Mr. Miller, that was wonderful.

883
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:26,346
I can't thank you enough.

884
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:30,210
- And you, Mr. Dudley.
- I'm sorry the bishop isn't here.

885
01:02:33,901 --> 01:02:35,973
- Are you all right?
- Yes. Thank you.

886
01:02:36,749 --> 01:02:39,051
What is keeping Stevens?

887
01:02:39,117 --> 01:02:40,972
Stevens, there you are.

888
01:02:41,037 --> 01:02:44,866
I'm sorry but the furniture shop
is closed until after New Year's.

889
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:48,138
I can't find a plumber.
We're out of turpentine.

890
01:02:48,205 --> 01:02:50,954
- This is preposterous.
- What about some witch hazel?

891
01:02:52,844 --> 01:02:55,692
- May I use your telephone?
- Of course. It's over there.

892
01:02:55,757 --> 01:02:57,131
Thank you.

893
01:03:10,349 --> 01:03:12,356
Tilda, this is Bishop Brougham.

894
01:03:12,429 --> 01:03:15,658
Will you bring a pair of my trousers
over to Mrs. Hamilton's house?

895
01:03:18,445 --> 01:03:21,674
What difference does it make?
Just bring me another pair of trousers.

896
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:23,912
Thank you.

897
01:03:23,981 --> 01:03:27,177
I'm so sorry this has happened.

898
01:03:27,245 --> 01:03:29,700
If only I could contact Julia or Dudley.

899
01:03:29,773 --> 01:03:31,781
Don't be nervous, Bishop.

900
01:03:33,453 --> 01:03:35,209
Have a chair.

901
01:03:35,277 --> 01:03:37,132
Thank you, I have one.

902
01:03:44,653 --> 01:03:45,830
He isn't here.

903
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,999
Perhaps the meeting was
more important than he thought.

904
01:03:49,069 --> 01:03:50,924
I suppose.

905
01:03:51,756 --> 01:03:53,611
We'd better go home.

906
01:03:56,812 --> 01:03:58,700
Dudley, it's strange thing.

907
01:03:58,765 --> 01:04:00,620
What's strange?

908
01:04:00,685 --> 01:04:04,482
You make me feel as if everything
is going to be all right.

909
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:06,793
- It could be if...
- If what?

910
01:04:08,301 --> 01:04:11,050
If people could only learn
to behave like human beings.

911
01:04:14,285 --> 01:04:15,812
Hey, taxi.

912
01:04:22,732 --> 01:04:24,042
Here's a cab.

913
01:04:26,285 --> 01:04:28,139
Will you please wait, Sylvester?

914
01:04:28,205 --> 01:04:30,060
Sure, mister.

915
01:04:30,125 --> 01:04:32,040
Sylvester?

916
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,356
Good evening. I'll be right with you.

917
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:45,340
This is one of
our most exclusive models.

918
01:04:44,653 --> 01:04:46,955
It's lovely.
Simply ravishing!

919
01:04:47,021 --> 01:04:48,744
So chic, so young.

920
01:04:48,813 --> 01:04:51,682
- It is sweet, isn't it?
- It's stunning.

921
01:04:51,757 --> 01:04:55,820
Not everyone could wear such a daring
hat. It was made for madame.

922
01:05:11,948 --> 01:05:15,843
How did you know
my name was Sylvester?

923
01:05:15,917 --> 01:05:19,180
It's up there on your card.

924
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:23,940
Could you drive us
through the park, please?

925
01:05:24,013 --> 01:05:26,230
That's out of your way.

926
01:05:25,644 --> 01:05:28,230
Sylvester,
are you getting bored with us?

927
01:05:28,301 --> 01:05:31,814
Oh, no. I'll drive you
to Mexico City, if you want.

928
01:05:31,885 --> 01:05:33,259
Thank you.

929
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,355
I'm having so much fun.

930
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,431
- Are you?
- Yes.

931
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,916
- Are you really?
- I feel as if I'm doing something bad.

932
01:05:42,989 --> 01:05:44,777
- Why?
- I don't know.

933
01:05:45,837 --> 01:05:48,390
I seems wrong to have
so much fun but...

934
01:05:48,461 --> 01:05:51,308
I can't figure out why.

935
01:05:51,373 --> 01:05:54,689
You folks know
what's wrong with this country?

936
01:05:54,765 --> 01:05:57,448
I've heard several versions
of that.

937
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:00,266
- Do you know?
- I think I do.

938
01:06:01,164 --> 01:06:03,717
Too many people who don't know
where they're going...

939
01:06:03,788 --> 01:06:06,276
and they want to get there too fast.

940
01:06:06,349 --> 01:06:10,280
Take you two.
I'd call you unusual.

941
01:06:09,644 --> 01:06:12,361
Thank you. You're very perceptive.

942
01:06:12,428 --> 01:06:16,323
You know your destination
but are in no hurry to get there.

943
01:06:16,397 --> 01:06:19,212
You want to enjoy
some scenery en route.

944
01:06:19,277 --> 01:06:21,630
And you're not reluctant to spend
an extra four bits...

945
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:23,686
for a detour with Mother Nature.

946
01:06:24,716 --> 01:06:26,026
Look where you're going!

947
01:06:28,748 --> 01:06:31,083
Well, my goodness.

948
01:06:31,149 --> 01:06:33,866
Did you see the way
I missed that truck?

949
01:06:33,933 --> 01:06:37,446
- It was like a miracle.
- Yes, but don't overplay your hand.

950
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:51,436
Sylvester, pull up here.

951
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,745
We're going skating.

952
01:06:52,813 --> 01:06:55,268
We mustn't. It's late.
We couldn't.

953
01:06:55,341 --> 01:06:58,210
- Do you think we could?
- Henry can wait a little longer.

954
01:06:58,285 --> 01:07:00,456
- Yeah.
- Sylvester, stop the car.

955
01:07:06,829 --> 01:07:08,684
- I am wicked.
- If you are, so am I.

956
01:07:08,749 --> 01:07:11,051
And that's impossible.
Can you skate?

957
01:07:11,117 --> 01:07:13,605
I used to but I'm too old now.

958
01:07:13,676 --> 01:07:16,459
Put on some skates.
You'll find out how young you are.

959
01:07:36,812 --> 01:07:38,787
I don't know about this.

960
01:07:57,293 --> 01:07:59,147
Relax. That's right.

961
01:08:11,341 --> 01:08:13,195
Pretty hat.

962
01:08:44,077 --> 01:08:46,466
- Why, Dudley!
- Now you.

963
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:49,300
- Oh, no. L...
- Come on.

964
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:59,977
- Dudley, this is heaven.
- You found the perfect word.

965
01:09:22,477 --> 01:09:24,484
Look what I'm doing!

966
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:28,999
You're a beautiful skater.
In fact, you're beautiful.

967
01:09:37,197 --> 01:09:39,401
Look at Sylvester!

968
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:45,420
Now, Sylvester.

969
01:10:08,684 --> 01:10:10,277
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

970
01:10:10,348 --> 01:10:12,690
Keep cool, Sylvester!

971
01:10:14,637 --> 01:10:16,492
Relax.

972
01:10:18,604 --> 01:10:20,960
That's right. Come on.

973
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:22,922
Give me the other one.
That's it.

974
01:10:22,988 --> 01:10:25,476
Relax. No, not collapse.

975
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:31,115
Hang on to me.

976
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:39,817
Don't leave me!

977
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:56,235
How am I doing, Dudley?

978
01:11:08,972 --> 01:11:10,827
Wait for me!

979
01:11:57,613 --> 01:11:59,468
Thank you, Dudley.

980
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:02,631
- How much do I owe you?
- Not a cent, my friend.

981
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:06,377
My pockets are bulging with the coins
of self-satisfaction.

982
01:12:06,445 --> 01:12:08,670
- Know why?
- I'd love to know.

983
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:12,614
Because you two have restored
my faith in human nature.

984
01:12:12,684 --> 01:12:14,724
Good night, Dudley and Julia.

985
01:12:14,796 --> 01:12:16,771
- Good night, Sylvester.
- Good night, Sylvester.

986
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:24,684
Sylvester is a noble soul.

987
01:12:24,748 --> 01:12:28,904
His children and his children's children
will rise up and call him blessed.

988
01:12:30,284 --> 01:12:33,099
This has been the most wonderful
evening I've had in years.

989
01:12:33,164 --> 01:12:35,815
This has been the most wonderful
evening I've had in centuries.

990
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:41,352
- I hope I haven't left the key...
- Go on in. It's open.

991
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:41,484
Thank you.

992
01:12:41,484 --> 01:12:43,306
Thank you.

993
01:12:43,372 --> 01:12:45,761
- Hello, Queenie.
- Hello, Queenie. How are you?

994
01:12:45,836 --> 01:12:47,494
- Can I help you?
- Yes, please.

995
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:49,931
- All right.
- Oh! You got my shoe.

996
01:12:49,996 --> 01:12:52,484
- Hello, Henry.
- Well, Henry.

997
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:55,207
I thought you were going to meet us
at St. Timothy's.

998
01:12:55,276 --> 01:12:56,738
What happened to you?

999
01:12:56,812 --> 01:12:59,049
- Can I take that?
- Thank you. You'll never guess.

1000
01:13:00,013 --> 01:13:01,867
- We went skating.
- The coat...

1001
01:13:01,933 --> 01:13:03,394
There you are.

1002
01:13:04,108 --> 01:13:05,668
- See you in a minute.
- All right.

1003
01:13:07,724 --> 01:13:10,375
- Skating?
- Yes. Dudley's a marvelous skater.

1004
01:13:10,444 --> 01:13:12,778
He made me imagine that I was good.

1005
01:13:12,845 --> 01:13:17,100
You should have heard the boys
at St. Timothy's. It was heavenly.

1006
01:13:17,164 --> 01:13:19,652
- I'm sure of that.
- Did you have a successful meeting?

1007
01:13:19,724 --> 01:13:22,290
- Did you?
- Satisfactory.

1008
01:13:21,644 --> 01:13:25,280
Good. I want to see Debby
before she goes to sleep.

1009
01:13:26,828 --> 01:13:29,098
- You haven't said a word about it.
- About what?

1010
01:13:29,165 --> 01:13:31,270
My new hat.

1011
01:13:34,732 --> 01:13:36,968
- What do you think?
- Charming.

1012
01:13:37,996 --> 01:13:39,851
Thank you.
I'll be right down.

1013
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:44,747
I know that Julia is
absolutely blameless in this.

1014
01:13:44,812 --> 01:13:47,682
- Of course she is.
- You stopped me from joining you.

1015
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:50,277
Julia had a very good time.

1016
01:13:50,348 --> 01:13:52,006
I didn't.

1017
01:13:53,292 --> 01:13:56,074
If you'd sent me to Mrs. Hamilton's
I would have gone.

1018
01:13:56,141 --> 01:13:58,726
You didn't.
So I went with your wife.

1019
01:13:58,796 --> 01:14:00,901
Is that part of
the normal duties of an...

1020
01:14:06,092 --> 01:14:08,040
Of an angel?

1021
01:14:07,628 --> 01:14:11,654
Sometimes angels must rush in
where fools fear to tread.

1022
01:14:11,724 --> 01:14:14,659
I don't know what that means
and don't explain it.

1023
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:19,722
You can go now.

1024
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:21,763
- I've solved my problem.
- Have you?

1025
01:14:21,836 --> 01:14:25,030
Mrs. Hamilton is giving the money
for the cathedral.

1026
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:26,824
That was a foregone conclusion...

1027
01:14:26,892 --> 01:14:30,187
if you were willing to sacrifice
your principles.

1028
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:35,402
Don't you think this glorious edifice
is worth it?

1029
01:14:37,292 --> 01:14:40,110
I'm not so sure of its glory.

1030
01:14:39,628 --> 01:14:42,181
- You're not?
- No, I'm not.

1031
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:45,729
These are lean years for the world.

1032
01:14:45,804 --> 01:14:49,317
So many people need food and shelter.

1033
01:14:49,388 --> 01:14:53,000
That big roof could make
so many little roofs.

1034
01:14:53,068 --> 01:14:57,225
We're dealing with a materialistic
woman who doesn't care about that.

1035
01:14:57,292 --> 01:14:59,147
Did you try?

1036
01:15:00,236 --> 01:15:02,822
It's all arranged.
It's finished.

1037
01:15:02,893 --> 01:15:05,892
You came so that I could have
a cathedral. Now I want you to go.

1038
01:15:05,964 --> 01:15:09,000
Get out of my life and away from Julia.

1039
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:12,642
Pray for that. It was
your prayer that brought me here.

1040
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:38,021
- That was no prayer.
- It was right from my heart.

1041
01:15:38,092 --> 01:15:40,640
- I want you to go.
- Julia doesn't.

1042
01:15:42,412 --> 01:15:44,103
Get out!

1043
01:15:46,028 --> 01:15:49,476
Julia's coming back.
Don't let her see you like that.

1044
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:51,403
Try to calm yourself.

1045
01:16:05,196 --> 01:16:07,050
Debby wants to say good night to Dudley.

1046
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:09,449
- Where is he?
- He's gone.

1047
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:11,142
- Where?
- How should I know?

1048
01:16:12,684 --> 01:16:14,823
- Why did he leave?
- I got rid of him.

1049
01:16:14,892 --> 01:16:17,675
- I fired him.
- Why?

1050
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:20,806
He's incompetent
and I can't stand the sight of him!

1051
01:16:48,876 --> 01:16:52,454
Mummy, I'm sure that Dudley's
never coming back.

1052
01:16:53,388 --> 01:16:55,843
Darling, you must never say never.

1053
01:16:55,916 --> 01:16:57,771
Where is he?

1054
01:16:58,412 --> 01:17:00,267
Come here, dear.

1055
01:17:02,924 --> 01:17:05,063
Listen to me.

1056
01:17:05,132 --> 01:17:07,815
Dudley wouldn't leave
without saying a word.

1057
01:17:07,884 --> 01:17:11,233
Beside, he promised to tell you
about Santa Claus.

1058
01:17:11,308 --> 01:17:13,163
He knows him very well.

1059
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,740
But it's almost Christmas Eve.

1060
01:17:17,836 --> 01:17:19,746
Soon I'll have to go to bed.

1061
01:17:19,819 --> 01:17:22,800
I told you he wouldn't leave
without saying a word.

1062
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:24,677
- Would he, Matilda?
- Oh, no.

1063
01:17:24,748 --> 01:17:27,683
That wouldn't be like Mr. Dudley.

1064
01:17:27,755 --> 01:17:30,658
Come along, Debby.
I'll get you ready for dinner.

1065
01:17:30,732 --> 01:17:34,344
- Will you come see me later?
- Of course.

1066
01:17:56,396 --> 01:17:58,251
Here is the list of your calls.

1067
01:17:58,316 --> 01:18:00,683
- Ending at Mrs. Hamilton's.
- Thank you.

1068
01:18:00,747 --> 01:18:03,617
Miss Cassaway, here is the manuscript
to my Christmas sermon.

1069
01:18:03,692 --> 01:18:07,848
I shall want the original
and five carbons for the press.

1070
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:11,113
If you finish before I come back,
leave them on my desk.

1071
01:18:13,804 --> 01:18:17,360
I'm sorry to keep you so long
on Christmas Eve.

1072
01:18:16,652 --> 01:18:20,040
I understand.
It must be done.

1073
01:18:21,964 --> 01:18:23,819
I'm ready to start out now.

1074
01:18:24,844 --> 01:18:27,266
We're going to the Trubb-Shaws,
then...

1075
01:18:29,644 --> 01:18:31,651
Then to the Van Dovers.

1076
01:18:31,724 --> 01:18:34,280
Good-bye, Miss Cassaway.

1077
01:18:44,459 --> 01:18:46,794
- Sylvester!
- Hello, Julia.

1078
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:48,202
What are you doing here?

1079
01:18:48,268 --> 01:18:52,130
I've been waiting about an hour
hoping for another skating party.

1080
01:18:52,204 --> 01:18:54,276
I didn't want to miss it.
Where's Dudley?

1081
01:18:54,348 --> 01:18:56,203
You got a preacher with you.

1082
01:18:57,387 --> 01:18:59,329
Oh, I know!

1083
01:18:59,404 --> 01:19:01,793
You and Dudley are getting married!

1084
01:19:02,604 --> 01:19:05,865
Sylvester, this is my husband,
Bishop Brougham.

1085
01:19:05,932 --> 01:19:08,233
- How do you do?
- Oh.

1086
01:19:09,676 --> 01:19:11,618
247 North Maple.

1087
01:19:16,876 --> 01:19:19,015
247 North Maple.

1088
01:19:34,219 --> 01:19:35,626
- Mildred.
- Oh!

1089
01:19:38,284 --> 01:19:40,804
Dudley, it's you.
I didn't see...

1090
01:19:40,876 --> 01:19:43,691
Where have you been?
We've been worrying about you.

1091
01:19:43,756 --> 01:19:46,309
And poor Mrs. Brougham.

1092
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:49,380
- What about her?
- She's been in and out of here all day.

1093
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:52,201
Asking if we've seen or heard from you.

1094
01:19:52,268 --> 01:19:55,333
- Where is she?
- She and the bishop are making calls...

1095
01:19:55,404 --> 01:19:57,258
finishing at Mrs. Hamilton's.

1096
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:02,890
- I'll type this for you.
- Oh, no.

1097
01:20:02,956 --> 01:20:04,330
- You go.
- The bishop told me...

1098
01:20:04,396 --> 01:20:07,210
It's almost Christmas Eve.
You must have shopping to do.

1099
01:20:08,939 --> 01:20:11,274
- Go on.
- Thank you, Dudley.

1100
01:20:13,835 --> 01:20:15,723
Merry Christmas, Mildred.

1101
01:20:15,788 --> 01:20:17,643
Merry Christmas, Dudley.

1102
01:20:48,108 --> 01:20:49,962
Take a sermon.

1103
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:54,373
Tonight, I want to tell you the story
of an empty stocking.

1104
01:20:56,396 --> 01:20:59,265
Once upon a midnight clear,
there was a chilïs cry.

1105
01:21:00,427 --> 01:21:02,729
A blazing star hung over a stable...

1106
01:21:02,795 --> 01:21:04,999
and wise men came with birthday gifts.

1107
01:21:05,067 --> 01:21:06,474
Have you got that?

1108
01:21:06,890 --> 01:21:10,020
Good. We haven't forgotten that night
down the centuries.

1109
01:21:10,092 --> 01:21:13,408
We celebrate it with stars hung
on the Christmas tree and bells...

1110
01:21:13,484 --> 01:21:15,972
and gifts, especially gifts.

1111
01:21:16,044 --> 01:21:20,353
We buy them, wrap them
and put them under the tree.

1112
01:21:20,427 --> 01:21:23,624
You give me a tie.
I give you a book.

1113
01:21:23,692 --> 01:21:27,140
Aunt Martha wants
an orange squeezer.

1114
01:21:27,211 --> 01:21:29,448
Uncle Harry can use a new pipe.

1115
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:35,971
We forget nobody, adult or child.

1116
01:21:36,043 --> 01:21:38,200
All the stockings are filled.

1117
01:21:37,644 --> 01:21:39,499
All except one.

1118
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:08,007
- I'm sorry, Matilda.
- Mr. Dudley, I knew you'd come back.

1119
01:22:08,075 --> 01:22:10,792
I knew you hadn't walked out on us.

1120
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:12,136
Of course not.

1121
01:22:12,204 --> 01:22:15,019
Debby's been so worried
and Mrs. Brougham...

1122
01:22:15,084 --> 01:22:17,801
Run upstairs.
Tell Debby I'll see her later.

1123
01:22:17,868 --> 01:22:20,323
- I have some work to do.
- I'll tell her.

1124
01:23:05,227 --> 01:23:07,333
One moment, please.

1125
01:23:07,403 --> 01:23:10,022
- Is Mrs. Hamilton expecting you?
- No, but she'll want to see me.

1126
01:23:10,092 --> 01:23:14,282
- I'm the bishop's assistant.
- You're not expected, but the bishop is.

1127
01:23:14,348 --> 01:23:17,250
I told you, Stevens,
she'll wish to see me.

1128
01:24:44,267 --> 01:24:47,912
"This was composed for you,
my darling, and you only. Allan."

1129
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:50,052
Her husbanïs name was George.

1130
01:26:49,292 --> 01:26:51,146
Good evening.

1131
01:26:52,651 --> 01:26:54,953
That music you were playing.

1132
01:26:55,019 --> 01:26:57,353
I'm the only one living
that knows that composition.

1133
01:26:58,155 --> 01:27:00,010
It's a shame that
we're the only ones...

1134
01:27:00,075 --> 01:27:02,279
who appreciate the lost genius of
Allan Cartwright.

1135
01:27:02,347 --> 01:27:05,129
- You know about him?
- Oh, yes.

1136
01:27:05,195 --> 01:27:09,058
The world lost a brilliant,
young composer when he died.

1137
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:14,401
That was forty years ago.
You couldn't have known him.

1138
01:27:16,450 --> 01:27:19,338
I'm older than you think.
Come, let us sit down.

1139
01:27:25,068 --> 01:27:28,380
- What is your name?
- My name is Dudley.

1140
01:27:30,732 --> 01:27:33,640
Tell me about Allan and you.

1141
01:27:40,107 --> 01:27:41,384
Tell me.

1142
01:27:44,491 --> 01:27:48,070
Allan Cartwright
was the only man I ever loved.

1143
01:27:49,324 --> 01:27:51,178
We were engaged to be married.

1144
01:27:52,011 --> 01:27:53,866
I got frightened.

1145
01:27:54,667 --> 01:27:57,896
He had nothing and
I was afraid of poverty.

1146
01:27:57,964 --> 01:27:59,819
He went away.

1147
01:28:01,323 --> 01:28:03,178
I never saw him again.

1148
01:28:04,875 --> 01:28:07,242
I never loved George Hamilton.

1149
01:28:07,308 --> 01:28:09,675
He was very much in love with me.

1150
01:28:09,739 --> 01:28:12,440
He was wealthy.

1151
01:28:13,355 --> 01:28:16,651
I've spent a fortune honoring
his memory in empty monuments.

1152
01:28:27,755 --> 01:28:30,210
The Hamilton mansion.
Never been here before.

1153
01:28:30,283 --> 01:28:33,131
- What do I owe you?
- No charge. I'm not busy.

1154
01:28:33,195 --> 01:28:35,650
- Thank you, Sylvester.
- I'll be seeing you, Julia.

1155
01:28:43,915 --> 01:28:47,160
That must be Henry and Julia
at the door.

1156
01:28:46,635 --> 01:28:50,115
The bishop! I can't see him now.

1157
01:28:50,188 --> 01:28:52,710
- Oh, yes, you will.
- No!

1158
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:53,961
Yes.

1159
01:28:55,916 --> 01:28:59,712
Just go out and greet them
in you usual warmhearted manner.

1160
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:06,860
The Bishop and Mrs. Brougham
are calling, madame.

1161
01:29:13,067 --> 01:29:16,613
- You'll stay for dinner?
- I'm afraid I can't.

1162
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:18,890
I have work to do.

1163
01:29:18,604 --> 01:29:20,630
Don't keep Henry and Julia waiting.

1164
01:29:32,811 --> 01:29:34,666
How do you do, Mrs. Hamilton?

1165
01:29:35,691 --> 01:29:38,179
How nice of you to come and see me.

1166
01:29:40,107 --> 01:29:41,995
Merry Christmas.

1167
01:29:43,404 --> 01:29:45,705
Let's go into the drawing room.

1168
01:29:51,755 --> 01:29:56,326
- Merry Christmas to you too.
- Oh, we're old friends. Call me Agnes.

1169
01:29:57,899 --> 01:29:59,754
You too, Julia, dear.

1170
01:29:59,819 --> 01:30:01,761
Yes, of course.

1171
01:30:06,379 --> 01:30:08,234
But he's gone already.

1172
01:30:08,715 --> 01:30:10,024
Who?

1173
01:30:12,235 --> 01:30:14,242
- He was here.
- I should have known it.

1174
01:30:14,315 --> 01:30:18,025
- Where did he go?
- The poor man had so much work to do.

1175
01:30:18,091 --> 01:30:19,946
You must make him take some rest.

1176
01:30:20,011 --> 01:30:21,866
I've been trying to.

1177
01:30:21,931 --> 01:30:25,706
I can't thank you enough
for sending him to me. But sit down.

1178
01:30:25,771 --> 01:30:31,008
Meeting Dudley has been the greatest
spiritual experience of my life.

1179
01:30:31,083 --> 01:30:32,293
I'm so glad.

1180
01:30:32,363 --> 01:30:34,949
How did you find him?

1181
01:30:35,019 --> 01:30:37,124
- It was an accident.
- It was a miracle.

1182
01:30:37,195 --> 01:30:41,188
Indeed. Talking with this
wonderful, understanding man has...

1183
01:30:42,891 --> 01:30:45,793
I've changed my mind
about the cathedral.

1184
01:30:45,867 --> 01:30:49,828
My money's going to those who need it.
The poor and the homeless.

1185
01:30:49,899 --> 01:30:53,958
The unappreciated people here
and around the world.

1186
01:30:54,027 --> 01:30:57,126
I want you to direct
the spending of the money.

1187
01:30:57,195 --> 01:30:59,813
- You see what Dudley has done?
- I see.

1188
01:30:59,883 --> 01:31:02,469
- Now you understand...
- Thank you, Mrs. Hamilton.

1189
01:31:04,171 --> 01:31:06,211
I'll be home later
for dinner, or something.

1190
01:31:06,987 --> 01:31:09,223
I don't know what...

1191
01:31:09,291 --> 01:31:11,146
Good-bye.

1192
01:31:55,692 --> 01:31:56,739
Hello, Professor.

1193
01:31:58,667 --> 01:32:00,720
Come in, my dear fellow.

1194
01:32:01,970 --> 01:32:03,620
Sit down.
Let me take your coat.

1195
01:32:03,691 --> 01:32:06,178
- No, thanks.
- Not there. Here.

1196
01:32:06,252 --> 01:32:08,324
This is the only reliable chair.

1197
01:32:08,395 --> 01:32:11,973
This is a surprise and an honor.

1198
01:32:12,043 --> 01:32:13,898
We must have a glass of sherry.

1199
01:32:13,963 --> 01:32:16,167
- No, thank you.
- I insist.

1200
01:32:16,235 --> 01:32:18,788
I want to show you something.

1201
01:32:18,859 --> 01:32:21,925
You see this bottle
and note that it is full?

1202
01:32:21,995 --> 01:32:23,457
Watch.

1203
01:32:23,810 --> 01:32:28,649
This is inexplicable even to you with
your vast ecclesiastical knowledge.

1204
01:32:31,787 --> 01:32:34,121
Observe that it is still full.

1205
01:32:34,187 --> 01:32:37,860
How do you account for that?
And the sherry.

1206
01:32:37,611 --> 01:32:40,742
It stimulates, warms and inspires.

1207
01:32:40,812 --> 01:32:43,975
But no matter how much you drink,
it never inebriates.

1208
01:32:44,043 --> 01:32:46,694
I can account for it.
Dudley's been here.

1209
01:32:48,299 --> 01:32:49,608
And that's not all.

1210
01:32:49,675 --> 01:32:52,163
He told me some things about history
that opened my eyes.

1211
01:32:52,235 --> 01:32:56,293
Today I went to the university library
and read some ancient texts...

1212
01:32:56,363 --> 01:33:00,420
which have been undecipherable
to living scholars.

1213
01:32:59,659 --> 01:33:03,008
Suddenly, I could understand them.

1214
01:33:03,083 --> 01:33:07,460
And this is what I have done,
thanks to Dudley.

1215
01:33:06,667 --> 01:33:09,799
I'm actually writing my history.

1216
01:33:09,867 --> 01:33:13,893
Let's face it. Dudley is no
mortal man like the rest of us.

1217
01:33:14,955 --> 01:33:16,995
Is he?

1218
01:33:17,067 --> 01:33:19,718
- How did you know?
- I can't tell.

1219
01:33:19,787 --> 01:33:22,275
- What is he?
- He says he's an angel.

1220
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:25,478
- An angel.
- Nothing stopped me that time.

1221
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:28,362
- From heaven?
- That I'm not sure about.

1222
01:33:28,427 --> 01:33:29,801
An angel.

1223
01:33:30,763 --> 01:33:33,349
Too bad. He's such a nice fellow.

1224
01:33:34,379 --> 01:33:36,233
I should have known.

1225
01:33:36,299 --> 01:33:39,180
Nothing less could have put me to work.

1226
01:33:38,635 --> 01:33:40,490
I'm glad he's done somebody some good.

1227
01:33:41,050 --> 01:33:42,464
He's brought nothing but disaster
for me.

1228
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:45,670
That's absurd. He and Julia
were here the other day.

1229
01:33:45,739 --> 01:33:50,049
She seemed happy, quite like
her old, delightful self.

1230
01:33:50,123 --> 01:33:53,287
She's a different person
when she's with him.

1231
01:33:53,355 --> 01:33:55,243
He's made her despise me.

1232
01:33:56,139 --> 01:33:58,856
Are you sure he has done that?

1233
01:33:58,923 --> 01:34:01,476
- You think it's my fault?
- I didn't say that.

1234
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:04,614
This is a mystery
beyond my powers of comprehension.

1235
01:34:04,683 --> 01:34:07,072
I suppose I am to blame
for everything.

1236
01:34:07,147 --> 01:34:09,122
I asked for this in more ways than one.

1237
01:34:10,795 --> 01:34:15,814
Dudley's presence only confirmed that
I'd already lost Julia and Debby's love.

1238
01:34:18,219 --> 01:34:20,674
I must confess, my old friend.

1239
01:34:20,747 --> 01:34:23,082
You generously sent me a coin.

1240
01:34:23,147 --> 01:34:27,402
And I only saw its commercial value.
Now I don't know where it is.

1241
01:34:27,467 --> 01:34:29,769
I do. Here it is.

1242
01:34:33,067 --> 01:34:35,369
Where did you find it?
Don't tell me.

1243
01:34:35,435 --> 01:34:40,137
And what's more he told me what it is.
A muzeum piece. Worth a fortune.

1244
01:34:40,203 --> 01:34:43,815
You keep it. Give it to Julia
as my Christmas present.

1245
01:34:43,883 --> 01:34:46,152
It might bring luck to you both.

1246
01:34:46,218 --> 01:34:48,706
It seems strange, you a bishop...

1247
01:34:48,779 --> 01:34:51,146
and me, a broken-down, old scholar.

1248
01:34:51,211 --> 01:34:53,099
I feel terribly sorry for you.

1249
01:34:53,163 --> 01:34:55,432
I wish I could help.

1250
01:34:55,499 --> 01:34:58,314
- There's nothing to be done.
- There must be.

1251
01:34:58,379 --> 01:35:01,249
You and Julia have always
loved each other.

1252
01:35:01,323 --> 01:35:03,047
That's only partially true.

1253
01:35:03,115 --> 01:35:05,351
- I love Julia...
- Then fight for her.

1254
01:35:05,418 --> 01:35:06,847
How can I?

1255
01:35:06,923 --> 01:35:09,258
You have a tremendous advantage.

1256
01:35:09,323 --> 01:35:12,356
- Advantage over an angel?
- That's precisely it.

1257
01:35:12,427 --> 01:35:15,110
He's an angel.
Julia is a creature of earth.

1258
01:35:15,178 --> 01:35:18,343
She's a woman and you are a man.

1259
01:35:29,739 --> 01:35:33,055
Isn't it beautiful?
He did every bit of it himself.

1260
01:35:33,131 --> 01:35:37,768
So quick too.
I couldn't believe my eyes.

1261
01:35:37,835 --> 01:35:42,112
- What a blessing he's been.
- The tree's lovely.

1262
01:35:42,187 --> 01:35:46,800
I'm glad you like it. It's been years
since I've decorated a tree.

1263
01:35:46,603 --> 01:35:50,200
I usually get
the more disagreeable jobs.

1264
01:35:52,811 --> 01:35:54,218
Good night, Matilda.

1265
01:35:54,282 --> 01:35:56,901
- Sweet dreams.
- Thank you, Mr. Dudley.

1266
01:36:07,755 --> 01:36:10,057
I think my work here is almost finished.

1267
01:36:10,123 --> 01:36:12,261
I'll have to be going.

1268
01:36:15,435 --> 01:36:17,639
Where will you be going?

1269
01:36:17,707 --> 01:36:19,976
Wherever they send me.

1270
01:36:20,043 --> 01:36:21,352
Who are they?

1271
01:36:22,635 --> 01:36:24,773
My superior officers.

1272
01:36:25,803 --> 01:36:29,152
Will we ever see you again?

1273
01:36:30,283 --> 01:36:32,650
They seldom send us
to the same place twice.

1274
01:36:32,715 --> 01:36:35,200
We might form attachments.

1275
01:36:36,139 --> 01:36:39,816
- I don't understand.
- Of course not.

1276
01:36:44,715 --> 01:36:46,602
- I don't want to leave.
- Why?

1277
01:36:48,203 --> 01:36:51,269
There are few people who know the
secret of making a heaven here on Earth.

1278
01:36:51,339 --> 01:36:53,095
You are one of them.

1279
01:36:57,131 --> 01:37:02,220
- I think you should go.
- Please don't send me away.

1280
01:37:03,851 --> 01:37:07,910
- What are you saying?
- I'm tired of wandering.

1281
01:37:07,979 --> 01:37:12,681
I'm tired of existing where one is
neither hot nor cold, hungry nor full.

1282
01:37:19,210 --> 01:37:21,669
You must go away and never come back.

1283
01:37:42,891 --> 01:37:47,331
I've never fought an angel, but take off
your coat and put up your dukes.

1284
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:49,443
Why do you want to fight me?

1285
01:37:51,810 --> 01:37:56,103
Because you tried to steal my wife,
my child, the love that belongs to me.

1286
01:37:56,171 --> 01:37:58,025
Don't you realize that as an angel...

1287
01:37:58,091 --> 01:38:00,960
I could destroy you
with a bolt of lightning?

1288
01:38:01,035 --> 01:38:04,380
I don't care. Julia means
more to me than my life.

1289
01:38:03,659 --> 01:38:05,640
I'm not gonna lose her.

1290
01:38:08,363 --> 01:38:10,981
Then I have news for you.
I'm going.

1291
01:38:14,411 --> 01:38:16,996
I'll accept that when I see it.

1292
01:38:17,066 --> 01:38:18,408
No, you won't.

1293
01:38:18,475 --> 01:38:23,177
Because when I go you'll never know
an angel visited your house.

1294
01:38:23,242 --> 01:38:26,985
- What about Julia?
- She won't remember either.

1295
01:38:27,051 --> 01:38:30,280
Nor will Debby, the professor
or anyone else.

1296
01:38:31,947 --> 01:38:33,600
- I don't trust you.
- You may.

1297
01:38:35,210 --> 01:38:37,288
Because your prayer has been answered.

1298
01:38:37,355 --> 01:38:40,802
That's not true.
I was praying for a cathedral.

1299
01:38:40,874 --> 01:38:43,908
No, you were praying for guidance.

1300
01:38:43,979 --> 01:38:45,834
That has been given to you.

1301
01:38:52,683 --> 01:38:54,880
Just a minute, please.

1302
01:38:55,659 --> 01:38:57,640
Good-bye, Henry.

1303
01:39:04,010 --> 01:39:07,207
If we need you again,
will you come back?

1304
01:39:07,275 --> 01:39:09,010
Not I.

1305
01:39:08,619 --> 01:39:12,131
I should ask to be assigned
to the other end of the universe.

1306
01:39:12,202 --> 01:39:15,104
Because I was so difficult?

1307
01:39:15,178 --> 01:39:17,033
This difficulty was in me.

1308
01:39:17,098 --> 01:39:21,987
When an immortal envies the mortal
entrusted to him it's a danger signal.

1309
01:39:23,083 --> 01:39:25,417
Take her in your arms
and hold her tight.

1310
01:39:26,442 --> 01:39:28,297
Coming.

1311
01:39:29,259 --> 01:39:31,266
Kiss her for me, you lucky Henry.

1312
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:22,409
She's asleep.

1313
01:40:24,970 --> 01:40:26,825
Are you all right?

1314
01:40:27,723 --> 01:40:30,280
Of course I am.

1315
01:40:30,922 --> 01:40:32,832
Did you get that for Debby?

1316
01:40:38,762 --> 01:40:40,617
I can't imagine where it came from.

1317
01:40:52,171 --> 01:40:54,243
Why, Henry. What is it?

1318
01:40:55,810 --> 01:40:57,440
I don't know. L...

1319
01:40:57,650 --> 01:41:00,776
I just have the most inexplicable
feeling of happiness.

1320
01:41:01,994 --> 01:41:03,423
- You know something?
- What?

1321
01:41:03,498 --> 01:41:05,407
There's a big bowl of cider downstairs.

1322
01:41:05,482 --> 01:41:07,043
That's for tomorrow afternoon.

1323
01:41:07,115 --> 01:41:09,860
Let's drink it now. To us.

1324
01:41:09,611 --> 01:41:11,466
To our happiness and what lies ahead.

1325
01:41:11,810 --> 01:41:14,281
Then let's smash the glasses
in the fireplace.

1326
01:41:15,434 --> 01:41:16,808
Listen.

1327
01:41:19,339 --> 01:41:21,600
That's coming from St. Timothy's.

1328
01:41:22,795 --> 01:41:26,341
Let's have the cider
after your Christmas Eve sermon.

1329
01:41:26,411 --> 01:41:28,990
- Oh, my sermon.
- Yes.

1330
01:41:28,618 --> 01:41:30,112
That's better still.

1331
01:41:32,075 --> 01:41:36,646
Ring the bells in adoration

1332
01:41:41,675 --> 01:41:44,991
We pour
We pour to Thee

1333
01:41:45,067 --> 01:41:49,300
Our supplication

1334
01:41:48,651 --> 01:41:50,854
That Thou wouldst

1335
01:41:50,923 --> 01:41:53,705
Grant us Lord

1336
01:41:53,771 --> 01:41:59,434
Salvation

1337
01:42:13,003 --> 01:42:15,392
Tonight I want to tell you the story...

1338
01:42:15,466 --> 01:42:17,321
of an empty stocking.

1339
01:42:20,235 --> 01:42:22,602
Once upon a midnight clear...

1340
01:42:22,667 --> 01:42:24,720
there was a chilïs cry.

1341
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,775
A blazing star hung over a stable...

1342
01:42:30,282 --> 01:42:32,421
and wise men came with birthday gifts.

1343
01:42:34,314 --> 01:42:37,314
We haven't forgotten that night
down the centuries.

1344
01:42:37,386 --> 01:42:40,256
We celebrate it with stars
on Christmas trees...

1345
01:42:40,330 --> 01:42:43,233
with the sound of bells
and with gifts.

1346
01:42:43,979 --> 01:42:46,117
Especially with gifts.

1347
01:42:46,954 --> 01:42:48,809
You give me a book.

1348
01:42:48,875 --> 01:42:51,046
I give you a tie.

1349
01:42:51,115 --> 01:42:55,130
Aunt Martha wants an orange squeezer.

1350
01:42:54,635 --> 01:42:58,050
Uncle Henry can use a new pipe.

1351
01:42:59,083 --> 01:43:02,148
We forget nobody, adult or child.

1352
01:43:02,219 --> 01:43:04,706
All the stockings are filled.

1353
01:43:04,778 --> 01:43:08,040
All, that is, except one.

1354
01:43:09,130 --> 01:43:12,676
And we have even forgotten
to hang it up.

1355
01:43:12,746 --> 01:43:16,194
A stocking for the child
born in a manger.

1356
01:43:16,267 --> 01:43:18,274
It's His birthday we're celebrating.

1357
01:43:19,307 --> 01:43:22,154
Let's not ever forget that.

1358
01:43:22,218 --> 01:43:24,455
Let us ask ourselves...

1359
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:27,304
what He would wish for most.

1360
01:43:27,370 --> 01:43:30,305
And then let each put in his share.

1361
01:43:31,818 --> 01:43:36,128
Loving kindness, warm hearts...

1362
01:43:36,202 --> 01:43:39,780
and the stretched-out hand of tolerance.

1363
01:43:39,850 --> 01:43:43,014
All the shining gifts
