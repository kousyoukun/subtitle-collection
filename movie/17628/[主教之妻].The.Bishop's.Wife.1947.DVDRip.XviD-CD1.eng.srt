00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,838
- Oh. This is very kind of you.
- It's a privilege.

15
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,636
<i>(tyres squeal)</i>

<i>(tyres squeal)</i>

17
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,477
- Which way are you going?
- Over there. The Mutual Building.

18
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,115
- My doctor is in there. I have hopes.
- Fine.

19
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,435
- I'm all right now.
- Good luck to you.

20
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,189
- Thank you. Merry Christmas to you.
- Merry Christmas.

21
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,429
Mother, please lift me up! Please.

22
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,516
All right then. Just for a minute.

23
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,675
Look at that doll.
Look at the funny choo-choo train.

24
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,870
Come on now, darling. We have to go.

25
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,154
Oh, my baby! Oh, my baby!

26
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,909
Oh, my baby. Oh, you saved her.

27
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,510
Oh, thank God you saved my baby.
How can I ever thank you?

28
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,076
- Don't try. Just don't let it happen again.
- I promise I won't.

29
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,714
- Remember that. Now on your way.
- Yes.

30
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,359
It closely resembles its noble cousin -
the California red fir.

31
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,155
It's botanically dissimilar.
Pay me heed, Maggenti.

32
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,829
This is a specimen of the white fir -
<i>Abies concolor.</i>

33
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,599
Surely you, a native Roman,
know your Latin?

34
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,597
You wanna buy or not?

35
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,075
- Well, if it isn't my dear, beautiful Julia.
- Hello, Professor.

36
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,875
- What are you doing in this part of town?
- Buying a Christmas tree.

37
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,389
- Hello, Mr Maggenti.
- Mrs Brougham.

38
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,080
How much do you charge
for this miserable weed?

39
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,716
- $1.85.
- $1.85! For this half-hearted twig?

40
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,549
I shall pay you ten cents a branch
or take my trade elsewhere.

41
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,070
- What can I do for you, Mrs Brougham?
- You can save me that tree.

42
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,556
- The big one right by the door.
- OK.

43
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,796
Every Christmas for the past 18 years,

44
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,878
Maggenti and I have been
re-enacting the same argument.

45
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,310
I didn't know you celebrated Christmas.
I thought you had no religion.

46
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,557
That's true, my dear,
but I like to have a Christmas tree

47
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,671
because it reminds me of my childhood.

48
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,316
I feel, for some reason, that this is a good
time of year for looking backwards.

49
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,352
Can you imagine me
ever having been a child?

50
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,997
How's Henry?
I haven't seen him for some time.

51
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,076
Oh, he's well, thank you.

52
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,714
He's terribly tired and worried.

53
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,389
Is he having difficulty
raising money for the cathedral?

54
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,750
Yes. It's slow work.

55
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,033
- How's your book coming?
- Oh, splendidly.

56
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,358
Greatest history of Rome since Gibbon.
But, of course, nobody will read it.

57
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,395
Now, my good man, I do not choose to
prolong this tawdry bickering any further.

58
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,954
All right. Ten cents a branch.

59
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,153
- It's $1.40.
- Very well, my venal friend.

60
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,077
Here is your blood money.

61
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,953
Mr Maggenti, will you send the tree up
on Christmas Eve?

62
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,833
- But I don't want my daughter to see it.
- Don't worry.

63
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,589
I send it when the <i>bambino</i> goes to bed.
Merry Christmas.

64
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,554
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas! Come on.

65
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,837
There's something I'd like you
to give Henry for his cathedral fund.

66
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,715
That has been my lucky piece - not that
it's brought me luck, except knowing you.

67
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,437
It's an old Roman coin. I picked it up
years ago in Brindisi. It has little value.

68
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,552
- It's a wonderful contribution.
- Nonsense.

69
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,800
It might be called the "widow's mite" if
it weren't for the fact that I'm not a widow.

70
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,556
Why, Julia, this is no occasion for tears.

71
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,716
It's stopped snowing.

72
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,632
If only we could spend Christmas
back here where we were so happy.

73
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,116
- With you and all of our old friends.
- Now, now, now.

74
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,477
Good night, Professor.
I'll see you again very soon.

75
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,433
It can't be soon enough. Good night, Julia.

76
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,115
Why, Professor! How fine to see you again
after all these years. How well you look.

77
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,196
- How are you?
- Never better. And you?

78
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,436
Quite well also, thank you.

79
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,275
- I don't think you remember me.
- Of course I do. Where did we meet?

80
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,756
- Professor, after all these years...
- Just a moment.

81
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,952
- It wasn't Vienna, was it?
- Beautiful old Vienna.

82
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,356
The university. When I
was lecturing there on Roman history.

83
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,598
And what great lectures they were.
And what a one you were with the ladies.

84
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,472
Fancy you remembering that.

85
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,353
- I must confess, I had my moments.
- And still have.

86
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,676
- Where are you going?
- That car.

87
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,554
I couldn't help noticing
your tender parting from Julia.

88
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,830
- You know Julia?
- In a way, yes.

89
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,030
- Poor child.
- She's unhappy?

90
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,755
- When were you in Vienna?
- Oh, I've been there many times.

91
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,873
I'm interested in Julia and Henry.
What seems to be their trouble?

92
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,118
I never see Henry any more.
He has no time for riffraff like me.

93
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,357
He now consorts with the vulgar rich,
like Mrs Hamilton.

94
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,473
You know she had me fired from
the university here? Said I was a radical.

95
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,196
I, who have never taken any interest
in politics since the death of Nero.

96
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,757
Look at that. Henry's old church,
perishing from neglect.

97
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,916
- It's such a nice little church.
- Too little, I'm afraid.

98
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,157
It can't stand up
against the march of progress.

99
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,032
Well, I must be pushing on.

100
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,276
- Delighted to have seen you.
- A pleasure.

101
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,960
We must have a drink
to those old days in Vienna.

102
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,036
By all means!

103
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,795
- Good evening, Professor.
- Oh, Pat?

104
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,639
Have you any idea who that man is?

105
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,830
No. He's a stranger to me.

106
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,995
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Matilda. Hello, Queenie.

107
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,190
- Is Debby in bed yet?
- Yes, ma'am.

108
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,551
Mrs Hamilton and the committee
are in there with the bishop.

109
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,912
The dinner's been waiting a long time.
We didn't know what to do about it.

110
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,158
- We'll have dinner as soon as they leave.
- But what about the chicken?

111
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,955
Don't worry about it, Matilda, please.
Thank you.

112
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,196
Oh, Matilda. My bag.

113
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,032
Thank you.

114
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,511
Oh, I'm terribly sorry I'm so late.

115
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,837
Good evening, Mrs Hamilton.
I was delayed Christmas shopping.

116
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,873
Good evening, Mr Perry, Mrs Trumbull.
Hello, Mrs Ward.

117
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,434
I hope you've been having
a good meeting.

118
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,792
We have not. I've never in my life
encountered such fuzzy thinking.

119
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,639
- Do you think we've made any progress?
- No.

120
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,389
- Mr Perry was about to tell us something.
- Merely a suggestion.

121
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,919
If Mrs Hamilton approves,

122
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,999
we can place the George B Hamilton
Memorial Chapel here on the north-east.

123
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,714
It will be out of sight there.
I won't stand for it.

124
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,038
Mrs Hamilton, this cathedral cannot be
designed for the glory of an individual.

125
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,551
- It has to be created for all the people.
- I'm very displeased at your attitude.

126
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,992
I was instrumental in making you Bishop,
although others thought you too young.

127
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,829
- Is that an exaggeration?
- Oh, yes, Mrs... I mean, no.

128
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,111
- You were the guiding spirit.
- I distinctly remember...

129
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,789
I had confidence in you when you were
a poor little parson in the slums.

130
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,797
I confess my confidence is weakened.

131
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,876
I regret I've been a disappointment.

132
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,230
Regrets are no good whatsoever.

133
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,592
You give me the impression of being
confused, indecisive and ineffectual.

134
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,837
That is not the kind of leadership
we expect of our bishop.

135
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,678
You'd better remember one thing.

136
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,998
You will build that cathedral as I want it
or you will not build it at all.

137
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,076
That's all I have to say.

138
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,593
- Someone get this dog out of the way.
- Julia?

139
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,676
Queenie.

140
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,871
- Goodbye, Mrs Hamilton.
- Good evening, Mrs Brougham.

141
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,595
- Good evening, Mrs Brougham.
- Good evening, Mrs Brougham.

142
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,235
- Can we serve dinner now?
- Yes, Matilda.

143
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,670
- The chicken will be burned to a crisp.
- We'll be right in.

144
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,676
Julia, you knew Mrs Hamilton
was expected this afternoon.

145
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,439
I know, Henry. I'm sorry I was late.

146
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,279
What a ghastly afternoon.
What a ghastly woman.

147
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,312
I have no intention
of being strangled by her purse strings.

148
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,919
I was proud of you.

149
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,353
I had a most un-Christian impulse to give
her a good whack over the... mink coat.

150
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,550
I thought you stood up
to her magnificently.

151
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,116
I appreciate your appreciation
but what about my cathedral?

152
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,196
May I make a suggestion, Henry?

153
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,517
Why not postpone the cathedral
till after Christmas?

154
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,713
Impossible. The House of God
can't be put off. This cathedral must rise.

155
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,312
Plenty of rich people in this town. I'll have
to take advantage of their Yuletide spirit.

156
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,396
I can see it all now.

157
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,115
The McWhirters, the Hornes, the Van
Deusens, the lunches, the meetings

158
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,037
and you there flattering them.

159
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,913
- Kowtowing to them, begging.
- It's got to be done.

160
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,112
Oh, Henry. If you could see
your poor harassed face.

161
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,789
- You haven't done very much to help it.
- Miss Cassaway, what is it?

162
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,959
- Mr Trevor on the phone, Bishop.
- Tell him the bishop will call him back.

163
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,832
Yes, Mrs Brougham.

164
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,874
Henry, what's happened to you?
What's happened to our marriage?

165
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,151
We used to have such fun,
you and Debby and I.

166
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,078
We used to be happy
and make other people happy.

167
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,954
Henry, that was your gift.
You're no financier or promoter.

168
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,710
Julia, I want this cathedral to stand
like a great beacon. I want its light...

169
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,469
Oh, never mind. Keep that
for your next committee meeting.

170
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,078
- Here's a contribution I collected.
- What's that?

171
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,159
It's an old Roman coin. Professor
Wutheridge sent it. Wasn't that sweet?

172
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,748
Old fool. What does
he think I can do with that?

173
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,633
Well, it's a beginning.

174
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,955
Now all you need is another four million.

175
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,117
Julia, don't be flippant about this!

176
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,555
- Is dinner ready?
- Yes.

177
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,231
Let's go in and get it over with.
I have a lot of work to do.

178
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:16,995
For what we are about to receive, may
the Lord make us truly thankful. Amen.

179
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,955
- Julia?
- Yes?

180
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,358
I was just thinking... tomorrow
maybe we could go out together.

181
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,038
Where?

182
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,550
Well, just walk around
the way we used to.

183
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,874
We could go and call on the professor,

184
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,515
go to the park and watch the skaters -
that sort of thing.

185
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,077
Maybe we could have lunch together.
At Michel's. Do you remember that?

186
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,955
Michel's. Oh, it's been years
since we've been there.

187
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,036
<i>(door opens)</i>

188
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,038
Forgive me.
I've been trying to explain to Mr Trevor,

189
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,436
but he insists upon speaking to you
personally, Bishop.

190
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,516
Excuse me, darling.

191
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,599
<i>(rings bell)</i>

192
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,190
Matilda, keep the soup warm.
The bishop's been called to the phone.

193
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,108
- And we'll be out for lunch tomorrow.
- Yes, ma'am.

194
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,594
Of course, Mr Trevor. Yes, but...

195
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,431
I appreciate your difficulties, but...
Very well. I'll be there.

196
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,233
10:30 tomorrow morning,
then on to the board meeting.

197
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,828
All right. Yes. Goodbye.

198
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,676
Mr Trevor's office, 10.30, then the board
meeting in the Banker's Club at eleven.

199
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,031
- Yes, sir. Tomorrow. Thursday.
- You might as well go home.

200
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,391
- But there's a great deal to do.
- You must be tired.

201
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,149
Thank you. Don't forget tomorrow
you speak at the Junior Assembly.

202
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,236
- What time is that?
- One o'clock.

203
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,796
You made the appointment
over a month ago.

204
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,230
- Good night, Bishop.
- Good night.

205
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,430
Oh, God, what am I to do?

206
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,188
Can't you help me?
Can't you tell me?

207
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,916
Oh, God, please help me.

208
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,996
<i>(door shuts)</i>

209
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,833
Yes?

210
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,156
- Good evening.
- Good eve...

211
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,113
- What can I do for you?
- That isn't the question.

212
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,708
Well, what is the...?

213
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,559
What can I do for you?

214
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,956
I must ask you to telephone my secretary.
I'm in the middle of dinner.

215
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:31,279
I know, Henry. Your soup will keep warm.
You asked for help.

216
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,232
I? I... Who told you I asked for help?

217
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,831
Well, you were known to be a good man,
Henry, and you were heard.

218
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,236
I was instructed to come here
in answer to your prayer.

219
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,794
- Who are you?
- I'm an angel.

220
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,077
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm an angel.

221
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,556
- No wings at the moment, but...
- You're an angel.

222
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,717
I knew it. I've been working too hard.

223
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,795
I understand, Henry.
It's hard to believe, even for you.

224
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,309
I'm not one of the more important angels.

225
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,750
I just happen to be assigned
to this district temporarily.

226
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,954
You see, we're everywhere,
helping people who deserve to be...

227
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,433
...to be helped.

228
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,033
As you're walking through the city,
you may look into a strange face.

229
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,950
It may be the face of a murderer
or it may be the face of an angel.

230
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,276
You have some problems
with the building of this cathedral?

231
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,278
- Yes.
- It's a fine cathedral.

232
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,711
Ought to look magnificent up there
on top of Sanctuary Hill.

233
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,753
Well, Henry.
Do you believe I am what I say I am?

234
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,917
How can I? I've only got your word for it.

235
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,271
But you're a bishop.
You can trust the word of an angel.

236
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,197
I'd like to.

237
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,993
What do you propose to do?

238
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,156
- Perform a miracle?
- If necessary.

239
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,193
Why don't you? Create the cathedral
with one wave of your hand.

240
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,869
- How would you explain it?
- Well, I...

241
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,639
Tell the world
you're being visited by an angel?

242
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,716
You can't do that.

243
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,355
Henry, is anything wrong? I...

244
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,234
- Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't know you had...
- Julia. If you don't mind...

245
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,511
How do you do, Julia? I'm Dudley.

246
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,279
Henry is engaging me
to help him with his work.

247
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,392
- You're going to be his assistant?
- That's it.

248
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,830
I'm going to help Henry
to rest and get some relaxation.

249
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,394
- That's what I've been praying for.
- You too?

250
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,479
Henry. I'm so relieved. Isn't it wonderful
you've found someone to help?

251
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,431
- Yes, but...
- Where do you come from?

252
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,516
- All around.
- Yes. But where?

253
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,952
Julia, to tell you the truth,
he says that he's an a...

254
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,719
I've been doing some
social service work down town.

255
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,990
Now you'll be with Henry permanently?

256
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,395
For as long as may be necessary.

257
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:03,275
Julia, if you don't mind. I must talk to this
gentleman alone. I'll see you in a moment.

258
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,198
We were just having dinner.
Won't you join us?

259
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,471
That's very kind of you,
but I have a number of things to do.

260
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,990
You can understand, Henry.
So many people making mistakes.

261
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,759
- Yes. I see.
- Then we'll see you tomorrow?

262
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,519
- Oh, yes. Bright and early.
- Good.

263
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,872
Whenever you're ready, Henry.
Good night, Dudley.

264
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,956
Good night, Julia.

265
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,596
Are you sure you're an angel?

266
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,792
I know it isn't easy,
but you've got to take me on faith.

267
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,276
- Yes, but for how long?
- For just long enough.

268
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,791
Until you can utter another prayer and
say that you have no further need of me.

269
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,151
Then I'll be gone and forgotten.

270
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,229
But now Julia's waiting for you
at the dining table. You must go to her.

271
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,839
Yes.

272
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,990
But I don't...

273
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,711
- Henry?
- Yes?

274
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,593
What's the rest of Dudley's name?

275
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,958
- I don't know.
- Oh.

276
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,036
<i>(ice clinks)</i>

277
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,796
Are you nervous, dear?

278
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,273
No.

279
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,479
- The bishop didn't eat his breakfast.
- No. He took only his prune juice.

280
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,670
Prune juice? Is he sick?

281
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,157
He looked perfectly awful.
He said he had a very bad sleepless night.

282
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,990
Passing up a breakfast like that.
It just ain't normal.

283
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,511
Nobody expects him to be normal.
He's a bishop.

284
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,672
- Could I get you something, sir?
- No, thank you, Matilda.

285
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,872
- Maybe just a cup of tea?
- Nothing, thank you.

286
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,551
- Good morning, Miss Cassaway.
- Good morning, Bishop.

287
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,035
Did anything come
for the Cathedral Fund?

288
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,799
Mr and Mrs J Thurston Ward.
No contribution.

289
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,869
- Mrs Gerald Wilmarth. $15.
- 15? We had her down for ten thousand.

290
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,036
There's a letter explaining that this year...

291
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,958
I know. The same letter they all write.

292
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,755
I've put your personal mail on the desk.
The rest I'm taking to the office.

293
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,633
I'll be there after the meetings.

294
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,753
Oh. Matilda, I think
there's someone at the door.

295
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,632
Yes, sir.

296
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,796
Good morning, Matilda.
I'm Dudley, the bishop's new assistant.

297
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,798
Good morning, Henry.
I'm afraid I'm a little late,

298
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,391
but I stopped to chat to a traffic policeman
who was worried about his wife.

299
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,752
Thank you, dear. So I directed the traffic
while he telephoned the hospital.

300
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,077
- I see.
- She's doing fine. So's the baby.

301
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,079
Why, you must be Mildred Cassaway.
How do you do?

302
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,033
- How do you do?
- We're going to be working together.

303
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,038
That's very nice.
Oh, thank you.

304
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,153
- Thank you very much.
- See you later, Mildred.

305
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,558
Well. Ready for duty.
Completely at your service.

306
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,750
- No, no.
- I feel that...

307
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,632
No.

308
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:45,914
- Good morning, Julia.
- Good morning, Dudley. It's a lovely day.

309
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,756
- Lovely.
- Henry and I are going out.

310
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,872
- I'm sorry, but I have some appointments.
- You what?

311
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,834
There's Mr Trevor, then the board meeting
and the Junior Assembly.

312
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,474
- But, Henry, you promised.
- I know I did.

313
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,275
Well, Dudley could represent you
at those meetings, couldn't he?

314
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,391
Could I?

315
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,911
No. They expect me. It would never do
if I sent an a... assistant.

316
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,756
Excuse me.

317
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,873
Now...

318
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,873
Oh.

319
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,630
- The trouble is I can't explain.
- You needn't try to explain.

320
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,274
This is the way it is
and the way it will always be.

321
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,789
We've just got to get used to it, that's all.

322
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:37,552
I'll tell Matilda she can have the day off
and I'll take care of Debby.

323
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,798
I see that Mrs George B Hamilton
has pledged $1 million

324
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,275
- but has not yet sent her cheque.
- Never mind.

325
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,710
That's work for a bookkeeper,
not an ange... Work for a bookkeeper.

326
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,071
Aha. So you're beginning
to believe in me?

327
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,590
I don't know who you are,
where you came from or who sent you.

328
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,915
I just wish you'd make haste.

329
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,113
- Because the cathedral must be built?
- That's the most important thing.

330
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,674
Or because Julia must be happy?

331
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,679
It's going to be difficult to help you
until I'm sure what you want.

332
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,759
Well, I've got the...
Then there's... Oh.

333
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,313
Would you mind telling me
what you intend to do now?

334
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,035
This card index file is in an awful mess.
I'll reorganise it.

335
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,435
You're wasting time
on unimportant details.

336
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:51,590
Nothing's unimportant. We are
interested even in the lowliest sparrow.

337
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,308
- Hello, Debby.
- Are you Dudley?

338
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,830
- Yes. How did you know?
- Mummy told me.

339
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,916
She said you came to help Daddy.

340
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,192
- That's right.
- Mummy said you were very nice.

341
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,993
Well, that's extremely kind of Mummy.

342
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,908
Mummy said that maybe with you here
we will get to see Daddy sometimes.

343
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,828
- Maybe we will.
- That'll be enough out of you, Debby.

344
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,315
I asked Matilda
to put your lunch on a tray.

345
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,672
- Thank you, Julia. I'll get along very well.
- I'm sure you will. Come on.

346
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,758
- Goodbye, Dudley.
- Bye-bye, Debby.

347
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,871
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

348
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,513
Oh.

349
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,235
- Oh. Thank you, Matilda.
- Aren't you going to wear a hat?

350
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,999
- I never use one.
- It's very cold out.

351
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,193
- Oh, the cold never affects me.
- I think you should wear this.

352
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,791
I bought it for the bishop last Christmas,
but he's never worn it.

353
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,311
It's a lovely scarf. I'm sure the bishop
will appreciate it when he sees it on me.

354
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,238
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Bye.

355
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,712
Goodbye.

356
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,514
- What's the matter, honey?
- They don't want me.

357
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,315
- Why not?
- I guess I'm too little or something.

358
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,034
Oh. Now, now.

359
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,516
Why, that's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

360
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,835
Why, Dudley.

361
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,112
Come on, Debby.
We'll show them how wrong they are.

362
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,949
Hey, fellas. Hey, fellas!
Who's the head man around here?

363
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,230
- I am.
- I am.

364
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,034
- What's the idea of this game?
- This isn't a game. This is a battle.

365
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,072
We attack the fort
and they try to defend it. See?

366
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,272
I see. Well, this young lady
would like to get into it.

367
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,631
- Who, her?
- She can't fight. Her father's a bishop.

368
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,436
What difference does it make? Are you
high-hat? You like her on your team?

369
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,916
She couldn't throw a snowball
as far as I could spit.

370
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,479
Oh, couldn't she? Come on, Debby.
You show them what you can do.

371
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,673
- But it's true. I can't throw.
- Nonsense. Of course you can.

372
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,510
Pack it tight, put it in that hand,
throw the arm back, aim it and let it go.

373
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,879
- Hey!
- Beautiful! A bullseye.

374
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,549
- She pitched a curve.
- Did you see that?

375
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,275
Come on, kid. You're in our army.
We've broken their morale.

376
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,391
Charge!

377
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,320
- Will she get hurt?
- Probably, but she'll love it.

378
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,396
- May I?
- Surely.

379
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,115
Dudley, what are you doing out here?

380
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,358
- I'm just admiring the scenery.
- But aren't you supposed to be working?

381
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,314
I always take a walk before lunch.
A good idea - relaxing.

382
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,671
Oh. I wish you could
persuade Henry to do that.

383
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,870
I'll try.

384
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,516
By the way, I told Miss Cassaway to go
home and Delia not to bring me a tray.

385
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,870
What will you do about lunch?

386
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,958
I thought I'd go to Michel's.
Ever heard of it?

387
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,390
Michel's. That's a lovely place.

388
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,795
We used to go there.
That was years ago.

389
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,912
Well, how about
you and I going there today?

390
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,316
You and...? To Mich...?
Oh, no, I couldn't.

391
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,273
Why not? Surely you don't think
Henry would mind?

392
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,756
- I'd explain to him that we just...
- No, it isn't that, but...

393
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,715
Matilda's off Christmas shopping
so I have to look after Debby.

394
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,752
Well, here's Matilda now.

395
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,874
- Hello. If you wish... Oh, hello.
- Hello.

396
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,515
- If you wish, I'll take Debby home.
- But, Matilda, your shopping...

397
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,394
I finished it. I finished it so quick
it was just like a miracle.

398
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,909
Mummy! We won!

399
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,953
Oh, Debby, that's wonderful!
Congratulations.

400
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,234
- Come on! We're giving out the medals.
- Put up your hood, dear.

401
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,356
- Madam, welcome.
- Oh, Michel.

402
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,869
- It's been a long time.
- Much too long.

403
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,036
- But you know my husband's work.
- Yes.

404
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,550
He doesn't come to see us any more,
but we understand.

405
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,433
We understand.
This way, please.

406
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,311
- Is this satisfactory, monsieur?
- Fine, thank you.

407
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,556
- Friends of yours?
- Yes.

408
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,240
They're members
of the Cathedral Committee.

409
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,113
- Madam. Monsieur.
- No, thank you, Michel.

410
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,435
Julia, don't bother to look through that.

411
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,358
Michel, just bring us
the best lunch you can think of.

412
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,072
I see monsieur is a gourmet.

413
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,476
Perhaps you would be interested
in a <i>guinea-hen a la Michel?</i>

414
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,195
<i>- J'ai les truffles Francaises. Exquise!</i>
<i>- Je prefere les Italiennes.</i>

415
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,357
<i>Prefere les Italiennes?</i>
<i>Quel sacrilege!</i>

416
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,233
Please, Michel,
let's leave heaven out of this.

417
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,750
<i>Je prefere les Italiennes</i>
<i>surtout pas de cayenne, du paprika.</i>

418
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,519
<i>Du paprika? Du paprika.</i>

419
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,995
You speak French beautifully.

420
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,476
I've had quite a bit of work to do in Paris.

421
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,593
- Dudley, I've been wondering about you.
- Wondering about me? Why?

422
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,996
You know so much.
Makes me feel uncomfortable.

423
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,954
Well, in that case,
I'm sorry I learned anything.

424
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,878
But I'm glad you knew about Michel.

425
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,516
Oh, it's so nice to be back here again.
So nice.

426
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,269
You have memories of this place, Julia?

427
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,198
- Did you and Henry come here often?
- Yes.

428
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,153
This is where we became
engaged to be married.

429
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,636
Ah. Then I can understand
why you love it.

430
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,037
- Oh, hello.
- Pardon me.

431
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,993
Thank you. What about that?

432
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,398
My. Would you care
to have your palm read?

433
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,875
Oh, no, thank you.
Would you?

434
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,673
No, thanks. I know too much
about myself as it is.

435
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,633
You are different.
I know so little about myself.

436
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,399
Really? May I look at your hand?

437
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,988
- Can you do that too?
- It's not too difficult.

438
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,714
- You can read the future?
- Within limits.

439
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,751
He's holding her hand.

440
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,913
Well, what do you see?

441
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,032
Well, I never noticed.
Your eyes are green.

442
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,796
I see a great deal of happiness.
I see a woman who's adored.

443
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,150
I see a rich, full life.

444
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,478
- Do you see Henry's new cathedral?
- No. There's a fuzziness about that.

445
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,797
- Oh. And Debby?
- No need to worry about her.

446
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,913
Just thinking. The world changes
but two things remain constant.

447
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,554
- What?
- Youth and beauty.

448
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,800
They're really one and the same thing.

449
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,357
- Yes. The trouble is people grow old.
- Not everybody.

450
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,870
The only people who grow old
were born old to begin with.

451
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,834
You were born young.
You'll remain that way.

452
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,316
- Oh, I wish I could believe you.
- You may.

453
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,709
You haven't looked at my hand once.

454
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,958
I never know what to make of you. I never
know whether you're joking or serious.

455
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,117
I'm at my most serious when I'm joking.

456
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,719
Excuse me, Julia.
Gotta do something about that.

457
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,679
Do forgive me coming to your table.
My name is Dudley.

458
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,236
I believe you're all friends of Julia's.
Would you care to join us?

459
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,557
- Oh, no, thank you.
- Well, join us for some coffee?

460
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,717
How about that? Do come over.
Julia would be delighted.

461
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,308
- All right.
- Well, that'd be lovely.

462
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,398
- That's very nice.
- Just over here.

463
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,714
Hello, Mrs Caster.
How are you? Nice to see you.

464
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,076
Hello. How are you?

465
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,033
Michel, bring us three Benedictines.

466
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,199
- No, no. Make it three Stingers.
- <i>Oui, monsieur.</i>

467
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,232
Julia?

468
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,112
Julia!

469
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,673
Julia!

470
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,237
- Matilda, is lunch ready?
- We thought you were out for lunch.

471
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,669
I cancelled my appointment.
Is Mrs Brougham home?

472
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,473
- Debby's here, sir.
- And Mrs Brougham?

473
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,195
Why, sir, she went out to lunch
with Mr Dudley.

474
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,708
- With Dudley?
- Why, yes, sir.

475
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,391
I thought you knew, sir.

476
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,476
Yes, of course.

477
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,276
<i>(door slams)</i>

478
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,833
That's awful. Merry Christmas.

479
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,078
Santa Claus doesn't really look like that.

480
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,760
- You know Santa Claus?
- Certainly. Nice chap.

481
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,433
You must tell Debby about him. She's
just beginning to be a little bit doubtful.

482
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,953
- You like that hat?
- Yes, I'm crazy about it.

483
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,550
- Well, let's go in and buy it.
- Oh, no, I couldn't.

484
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,911
- Why, it's much too...
- Too what? Too attractive?

485
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,600
- My old friend, the professor.
- Hello, Professor.

486
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,918
- Julia! Are you with this man?
- Yes, of course. It's Dudley.

487
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,634
The professor knows me well.
University of Vienna.

488
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,799
I've been thinking about that.
I don't believe you've ever been to Vienna.

489
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,229
He always pretends
he's never seen me before.

490
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,874
I don't know who he is,
but I don't trust him.

491
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,231
- Professor, he's Henry's new assistant.
- Oh.

492
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,555
- You know this fellow?
- Of course I do.

493
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,390
Well, in that case, how about dropping in
for a bit of Yuletide cheer?

494
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,878
No, no. I have to go home. I...
Well, perhaps just for a few minutes.

495
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,956
Good. Come along.

496
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,830
There's a little sherry left.
It's rather inferior grade, but potable.

497
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,235
Professor, I see you're a religious man.

498
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,591
- What makes you think that?
- You have an angel on your tree.

499
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,790
Julia gave me that years ago.

500
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,673
- Your tree is beautiful.
- It's disgraceful.

501
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,713
However, it gives me the illusion
of peace on earth, goodwill toward men.

502
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,400
- To a charming lady.
- Lovely.

503
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,318
- You've noticed?
- Isn't it remarkable that you have?

504
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,069
Remarkable? When you want to know
about a woman, ask the old men.

505
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,156
They know.

506
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,636
Why don't you show us
the manuscript of your book?

507
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,273
- My book?
- Yes.

508
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,914
- Oh, no, no.
- You're writing one?

509
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,473
Yes.

510
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,670
- You didn't know?
- You didn't tell me.

511
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,749
I described that book in detail at the
lectures I gave at the University of Vienna.

512
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,556
All my pupils heard me.
Now I'm certain this fellow's an impostor.

513
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,592
That book?
I thought you'd finished that years ago.

514
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,395
I'll tell you... I'll tell you about my book.

515
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,670
For 20 years I've been talking about it

516
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,236
and promising the publishers
it'll be delivered next spring.

517
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,477
The funny part is
that I haven't written one word.

518
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,750
- Not one word.
- Why not?

519
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,431
I couldn't think of anything original to say.
Just the same old monotonous history.

520
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,516
Dry as dust.

521
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,316
That's the whole story of my life.
Frustration.

522
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,353
It's a chronic disease and it's incurable.

523
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,996
Once I was madly...

524
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,794
Once I was madly in love with a girl.

525
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,958
My friends, she was a vision of delight.
A pure enchantress.

526
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,833
- You never told me about it.
- That's the trouble.

527
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,397
I never told her about it either.
I couldn't find the words.

528
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,909
So she married an athlete.

529
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:57,512
A great hulking oaf who never
even reached the eighth grade.

530
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,359
But he knew how to say "I love you."

531
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,199
Same trouble with my book.
Can't find the words.

532
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,676
Even when you had this coin
to inspire you?

533
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,434
Why, that's the one
that you gave to Henry.

534
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:20,315
- Yes. I stole it off the table.
- You wasted your time. It's worthless.

535
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,433
On the contrary, this is
one of the rarest of all antiquities.

536
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,792
Only one hundred of these coins were
minted by Julius Caesar 2,000 years ago.

537
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,115
That was when Cleopatra visited Rome.

538
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,118
Presumably, these were used
to pay her hotel bill.

539
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,472
- I never knew that.
- Nobody knew except Caesar's wife.

540
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,194
- She was suspicious?
- Definitely.

541
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:45,108
She did not share her husband's
admiration for Cleopatra.

542
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,755
So she had these coins destroyed -
melted into ornaments.

543
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,871
This is the one she missed.

544
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,518
It's an unwritten chapter in history
and you, Professor, will write it.

545
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,030
- Do you know any more stories like that?
- Any number of them.

546
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,472
- You're a curious fellow, Dudley.
- Have you just begun to notice?

547
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,832
- What's your background?
- My background?

548
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,554
- Where do you come from?
- Well...

549
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,036
And don't tell me more about Vienna
because I won't believe it.

550
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,551
All right. If I told you I came from
another planet, would you believe me?

551
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,558
- I don't know.
- I'd believe you, Dudley.

552
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:27,037
And you'd be right, Julia, as always.
We all come from our own little planets.

553
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:32,359
That's why we're all different.
That's what makes life interesting.

554
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,390
We don't seem to be
making any headway.

555
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,709
First star I see tonight.

556
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,710
You must make a wish, Julia.

557
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:02,155
Oh, it's getting dark. Must be late. Henry
will be worried. We must be leaving.

558
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,319
- Oh, no.
- Yes. I'm sorry, Professor, but we must.

559
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,396
- Dudley?
- Yes, my friend.

560
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,399
- There's one thing that troubles me.
- What's that?

561
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,830
I'm an old man.
That history is a tremendous task.

562
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,919
I wonder... will I have time to finish it?

563
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,795
You'll finish your history, Professor.
You'll have time.

564
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,876
I believe you, Dudley.

565
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,712
For quite a while now,
every time I passed a cemetery,

566
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,195
I've felt as if I were apartment hunting.

567
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,276
Goodbye, Professor.

568
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,597
You've given an old man
a very happy afternoon.

569
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,836
- God bless you both.
- Thank you.

570
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,111
I'll pass that recommendation along.

571
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,316
<i>(clock chimes)</i>

572
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,876
My, that's pretty.

573
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,393
Why don't you take some of that pink stuff
and make little curlicues?

574
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:51,036
- I hope the dinner won't be spoilt.
- No, sir. I had a feeling they might be late.

575
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:55,199
Yes... Very considerate of you.
What's that cake for?

576
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,357
- What cake?
- That cake behind you.

577
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,155
That cake. Oh, for anybody
who might like cakes, sir.

578
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,511
But neither Mrs Brougham nor myself
like elaborate desserts.

579
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,313
But we've baked you an egg custard, sir.

580
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,556
<i>(door opens, voices)</i>

581
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,558
Hello, dear.
I'm sorry we were late for dinner.

582
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,353
- Good evening.
- We've had a marvellous time.

583
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,916
- I wish you'd been with us.
- Debby told me about the snow fight.

584
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,511
Did she? We went to see Professor
Wutheridge and we had lunch at Michel's.

585
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,949
- Is Debby in bed?
- No. She's waiting to see you.

586
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,389
Good. I'll just go up and say good night.

587
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,512
I won't be a minute.
I just want to see if she's all right.

588
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,238
- I trust you spent a profitable afternoon?
- Oh, yes.

589
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,397
Did you have a profitable afternoon?

590
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,475
Not very. I'd like to see you...
for a moment.

591
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,352
Certainly.

592
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,476
Excuse me.

593
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,796
Can you prove to me
that you are an angel?

594
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,876
Proof? You mean a document?

595
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,278
Surely you of all people should know
that an angel needs no passport.

596
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,675
I want to see you perform a miracle.

597
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,552
- What kind?
- Well...

598
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,796
Make this desk fly around the room.

599
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,118
Please. I didn't come down here
to do silly tricks. I'm surprised at you.

600
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,037
I don't believe you're an angel.

601
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,598
- I think you're a demon right out of...
- Oh, Henry. Don't say that.

602
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,156
- Well, anyway, you know how I feel.
- Yes.

603
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,591
Wait a minute.
There's another thing.

604
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,114
Oh. Dinner is served, Bishop.

605
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,836
Thank you, Dudley.

606
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:01,275
For what we are about to receive, may
the Lord make us truly thankful. Amen.

607
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,710
Pass the celery, Henry, please.

608
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,796
- Hm?
- The celery.

609
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,832
Thank you.

610
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,192
Thank you.

611
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,116
<i>(happy humming)</i>

612
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,551
What's that you're humming?

613
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,399
I don't know, dear.
Is it anything?

614
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,318
- It's rather gay.
- Well, I feel gay.

615
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,550
I like to watch you brushing your hair.

616
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,148
Thank you, dear. Is that a compliment?

617
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,068
Yes. You do it so... so capably.

618
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,952
Thank you.

619
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,510
In fact, now I come to think of it,
everything you do is capable.

620
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:33,958
I pride myself on the fact that we lead
a well-ordered life. The family, I mean.

621
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,756
Of course, the credit for that is due to you
much more than to me.

622
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,589
- I think you're an excellent wife.
- Thank you.

623
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,632
- Do you think I'm an excellent husband?
- Of course.

624
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,718
We're having an early supper
so we get to St Timothy's on time.

625
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,593
- St Timothy's?
- The rehearsal for the benefit.

626
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,554
- Oh, yes.
- You've been looking awfully tired lately.

627
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,116
I hope you're going to take it easier
now that Dudley's here.

628
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,312
- I think that he's very able.
- You do?

629
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:07,753
- Yes. He knows so many things.
- What, for instance?

630
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,519
You should have seen him
with Professor Wutheridge.

631
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,029
He knows more about history
than the professor.

632
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,116
He's been at it longer.

633
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,716
<i>(laughter)</i>

634
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,077
- <i>(Dudley)</i> Let's do that again.
- No. Tell me a story.

635
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,509
- What, now?
- Don't you know any stories?

636
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,791
- I know hundreds of stories.
- Tell me one. Please.

637
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,993
All right. Let me think.
This happened many, many years ago.

638
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:45,398
That's not the way to begin.
Stories start "Once upon a time".

639
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,112
Yes, that's true.

640
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,994
Once upon a time there was a little boy
and he lived in a little town.

641
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,396
- What was his name?
- His name was David. He was a shepherd.

642
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,511
The town was called Bethlehem.

643
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,837
I know Bethlehem.
That's where the star was.

644
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,838
That's right.
Only David lived long before the star.

645
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,793
One night, David was out in the hills
tending his sheep.

646
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,708
- He was playing the harp and singing.
- Was he singing "Jingle Bells"?

647
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,037
No, no. "Jingle Bells"
hadn't been written then.

648
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,833
David was singing songs
that he wrote himself.

649
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,952
Suddenly, an angel came down
and spoke to David.

650
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,152
- How did David know it was an angel?
- He didn't know.

651
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,111
And that's the way it always is.

652
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,595
Angels come and put ideas
into people's heads

653
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,510
and people feel very proud of themselves
because they think it was their own idea.

654
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:35,269
This angel said to David
"One of your lambs has strayed."

655
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,359
So David put aside his harp and went
into the darkness to find the lamb.

656
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,198
The angel guided him.

657
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:46,440
And when David found the lamb,
he saw a great big ferocious lion.

658
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,879
Oh!

659
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,072
So David said to the lion
"You get away from that lamb."

660
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,988
And the lion said "You get away from me
or I'll eat you too."

661
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,076
- Did David run away?
- No.

662
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,715
You know why? Because the angel
put another idea into his head.

663
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,752
So David took out his sling
and he hurled a stone

664
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,110
and hit the lion right between the eyes.

665
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,629
I bet that lion was surprised!

666
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,594
Yes. And so was David because
he didn't know an angel had helped him.

667
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,757
Well, he picked up the lamb
and took it back to the fold.

668
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:20,635
Then he felt so happy that he made up
another song. It started out:

669
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,196
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want."

670
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,834
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures."

671
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,876
"He leadeth me besides the still waters."

672
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,150
"He restoreth my soul..."

673
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,552
You can tell the rest of this, Henry.

674
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,433
- Some other time.
- Hello, Daddy.

675
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,436
Miss Cassaway, will you get
Mrs Hamilton on the telephone?

676
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:50,314
- Miss Cassaway? Mrs Hamilton.
- Yes, Bishop.

677
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,831
- Good morning, Julia.
- Dudley.

678
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,793
I'll see you in a few minutes.
I have to see Matilda.

679
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,559
- Bye, Debby.
- Goodbye, Dudley.

680
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,955
- Thank you.
- Oh. Pretty.

681
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,876
Are you expecting a letter?

682
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,913
One never knows. If I should get one,
the stamp will be worth saving.

683
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,996
I'll have Mrs Hamilton in a moment.

684
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,588
- Are you seeing Mrs Hamilton?
- I hope to.

685
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:28,670
- May I come along? I'd like to meet her.
- Mrs Hamilton? Bishop Brougham.

686
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,829
Hello, Mrs Hamilton. How are you?
I'm glad to hear it.

687
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:39,034
Mrs Hamilton, I'd like to see you today.
This afternoon, if possible.

688
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,515
Yes, it is. It's very urgent.

689
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,439
- Oh, that's too bad.
- Terrible.

690
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,158
You can? Oh, that's splendid.
Thank you so much.

691
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,751
I'll be there. Five o'clock this evening.
Thank you, Mrs Hamilton.

692
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,872
Henry, you didn't make
an appointment for this afternoon?

693
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,672
Yes. It was the only time.

694
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,429
You can't do this to Reverend Miller.
The rehearsal's just for you.

695
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:08,030
They'll get along without me.
There are other things more important.

696
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,950
- Mr Miller will be delighted to see you.
- But it's not the same. You're his bishop.

697
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,116
I don't like going alone.

698
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:34,036
It's the big house
at the end of this street, driver.

699
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:40,235
Dudley, I take it that...
that you have the money for the taxi.

700
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,477
No. What makes you think I have money?

701
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,034
Oh, I just thought that you being an a...

702
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,754
Oh, goodness!

703
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,030
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

704
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,832
That's all right.

705
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,952
Thank you.

706
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,871
- I won't be late. I may even join you.
- Please try.

707
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,309
I'll see you in front
of St Timothy's in one hour.

708
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,000
- Try.
- I will be there.

709
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,112
- Good.
- This is it, driver.

710
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,314
- Good evening, Bishop.
- How are you, Stevens?

711
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:49,877
- Mrs Hamilton's in the drawing room, sir.
- Thank you.

712
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,316
Well, Bishop Brougham.

713
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,955
My dear Mrs Hamilton,
I've come to tell you...

714
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,753
- You've come to apologise, I trust.
- Exactly.

715
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,553
Upon consideration,
my objections seem petty

716
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,796
compared with the generosity
of your gesture.

717
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,912
I'm very much relieved.
Sit down, Mr Brougham.

718
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,998
What hurt most was to think
that my instinct had betrayed me

719
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,680
in recommending you for your position.

720
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,597
I'm unceasingly grateful.

721
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,393
Now, I'm taking it for granted

722
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,592
that the George B Hamilton Memorial
Chapel shall be located...

723
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,756
Just where you specified.

724
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:34,078
You no longer feel the effect will be
that it was built in my husband's honour?

725
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:37,636
That was said in dispute.
What matters is the cathedral be built.
