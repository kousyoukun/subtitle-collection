1
00:01:14,524 --> 00:01:18,392
Hark !!  The herald angels sing

2
00:01:18,494 --> 00:01:22,590
Glory to the newborn King

3
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:26,726
Peace on earth and mercy mild

4
00:01:26,803 --> 00:01:31,297
God and sinners reconcile

5
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:35,310
Joyful, all ya nations rise

6
00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:39,472
Join the triumph of the skies

7
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:43,713
With th'angelic hosts proclaim

8
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,189
Christ is born in Bethlehem

9
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:52,352
Hark!!  The herald angels sing

10
00:01:52,428 --> 00:01:56,956
Glory to the newborn King

11
00:01:57,066 --> 00:02:01,002
Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace

12
00:02:01,104 --> 00:02:05,404
Hail the Son of Righteousness

13
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:09,376
Light and life to all He brings

14
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,472
Risen with healing in His wings

15
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,480
This is very kind of you.
- lt's a privilege.

16
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:57,093
Which way are you going?
- Just over there. The Mutual building.

17
00:02:57,193 --> 00:03:01,027
My doctor's there. See, l have hopes.
- Fine.

18
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,333
l'm all right now.
- Good luck to you.

19
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,035
Thank you so much.
Merry Christmas to you.

20
00:03:06,135 --> 00:03:08,135
Merry Christmas.

21
00:03:28,024 --> 00:03:30,393
Mother, please!
Please lift me up!

22
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:32,873
All right.
Just for a minute.

23
00:03:35,164 --> 00:03:37,164
Look at that, Mom!

24
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,102
Look at the funny choo-choo train!

25
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:42,171
Come on, darling.
We have to go.

26
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:48,409
Oh, my baby!

27
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,944
You saved her!
Thank God, you saved my baby!

28
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:58,454
How can l ever thank you?
- Just don't let it happen again.

29
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:02,125
l promise you, l won't.
- Remember that. Now on your way.

30
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:04,225
Yes.

31
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,805
Mostly resembles its cousin,
the California red fir.

32
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:54,143
His botanical head is similar.

33
00:04:54,243 --> 00:04:58,323
Pay me heed.
This is a specimen of the white fir.

34
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,318
Surely, you being a native Roman
know your Latin.

35
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:04,418
You wanna buy or not?

36
00:05:06,722 --> 00:05:10,159
lf it isn't my dear, beautiful Julia.
- Hello, Professor.

37
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,595
What are you doing in this part of town?

38
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:15,031
Buying a Christmas tree.
Hello, Mr. Maggenti.

39
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:19,435
Mrs. Brougham, how do you do?
- What do you charge for this weed?

40
00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:24,472
$1 .85.
- For this halfhearted twig?

41
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:29,312
l'll pay you 10 cents a branch
or take my trade elsewhere.

42
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:33,216
What can l do for you?
- You can save me that tree outside.

43
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:35,551
The big one by the door.
- Okay.

44
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:39,022
Thank you.
- Each Christmas for the past 18 years...

45
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:42,158
Maggenti and l have been reenacting
the same argument.

46
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,160
l didn't know you celebrated Christmas.

47
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,430
l thought you had no religion.
- That's true, my dear.

48
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,434
But l like having a Christmas tree
because it reminds me of my childhood.

49
00:05:51,534 --> 00:05:56,437
l feel that this is a good time
for looking backwards.

50
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:59,409
Can you imagine me
ever having been a child?

51
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:02,739
How's Henry?
l haven't seen him lately.

52
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,446
He's well, thank you.

53
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:09,069
He's terribly tired and worried.

54
00:06:09,318 --> 00:06:13,122
ls he having difficulty
raising money for the cathedral?

55
00:06:13,222 --> 00:06:15,452
Yes.
lt's slow work.

56
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,996
How's your book coming?
- Splendidly.

57
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:22,265
Greatest history of Rome since Gibbon.

58
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:24,534
Of course,
nobody will read it.

59
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:29,906
And now, my good man, l choose not
to prolong this bickering any further.

60
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:32,941
All right.
Ten cents a branch.

61
00:06:36,078 --> 00:06:38,648
lt's $1 .40.
- Very well, my old friend.

62
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:40,650
Here is your blood money.

63
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,353
Will you send the tree up on
Christmas Eve? But not until late.

64
00:06:44,453 --> 00:06:46,689
l don't want my daughter seeing it.
- Don't worry.

65
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:49,258
l'll send it
when the little bambino goes to bed.

66
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:51,358
Merry Christmas.

67
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:56,063
Come on.

68
00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:06,542
There's something l'd like you to give
Henry for his cathedral fund.

69
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:08,642
That's my lucky piece.

70
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,914
Not that it's brought me any luck,
except knowing you.

71
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:15,985
lt's an old Roman coin. l picked it up
years ago in a junk shop.

72
00:07:16,085 --> 00:07:17,653
lt has little value.

73
00:07:17,753 --> 00:07:21,280
lt's a wonderful contribution.
- Nonsense.

74
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,960
lt might be called the widow's might...

75
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,697
if it weren't for the fact that l'm not a widow.

76
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:31,426
Julia, this is no occasion for tears.

77
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,264
lt stopped snowing.

78
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,406
lf only we could spend Christmas here
where we were so happy...

79
00:07:37,506 --> 00:07:39,408
with you and our friends.

80
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:41,508
Now, now.

81
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:48,384
Good night. l'll see you again soon.
- lt can't be soon enough.

82
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:50,543
Good night, Julia.

83
00:07:58,261 --> 00:08:02,265
Professor! How fine
to see you again after all these years!

84
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:04,433
How well you look.
- How are you?

85
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:08,443
Never better. And you?
- Quite well, thank you.

86
00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:13,576
l don't think you remember me.
- Preposterous! Of course l do.

87
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:16,913
Where did we meet?
- Professor, after all these years.

88
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:20,116
Just a moment.
lt wasn't Vienna, was it?

89
00:08:20,216 --> 00:08:22,552
Beautiful, old Vienna.
- The university?

90
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:25,388
The university.
- When l lectured on Roman history.

91
00:08:25,488 --> 00:08:28,090
That's it.
And what great lectures they were.

92
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,894
And what you were with the ladies!
- Fancy, you remembering that.

93
00:08:31,994 --> 00:08:33,896
l must confess,
l had my moments.

94
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:36,191
And still have.

95
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,167
Where are you going?
- That car!

96
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:42,305
l couldn't help noticing
your tender parting from Julia.

97
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:44,507
Do you know Julia?
- ln a way, yes.

98
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,902
Poor child.
- She's unhappy?

99
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:52,114
When were you in Vienna?
- l've been there many times.

100
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:54,951
l'm interested in Julia and Henry.

101
00:08:55,051 --> 00:08:58,187
What seems to be their trouble?
- l never see Henry anymore.

102
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,556
He has no time for riffraff like me.

103
00:09:00,656 --> 00:09:04,026
He now consults with the vulgar rich,
like Mrs. Hamilton.

104
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:07,163
You know, she had me fired
from the university here?

105
00:09:07,263 --> 00:09:11,133
Said l was a radical. l, who've never
taken any interest in politics...

106
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:13,273
since the death of Nero.

107
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,302
Look at that.

108
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:20,876
Henry's old church,
perishing from neglect.

109
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:24,413
lt's such a nice, little church.
- Too little, l'm afraid.

110
00:09:24,513 --> 00:09:27,984
lt can't stand up
against the march of progress.

111
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:30,084
l must be pushing on.

112
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:32,088
Delighted to have seen you.
- lt's a pleasure.

113
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:36,750
We must get together and have a drink.
- By all means!

114
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:41,077
Good evening, Professor.
- Pat.

115
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,020
Have you any idea who that man is?

116
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:46,243
No. He's a stranger to me.

117
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:57,880
Good evening, Mrs. Brougham.
- Good evening, Matilda.

118
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,082
Hello, Queenie.
ls Debby in bed yet?

119
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:04,887
Yes. Mrs. Hamilton and the committee
are in there with the bishop.

120
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:09,225
The dinner's been waiting a long time.
l don't know what to do about it.

121
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:11,961
We'll have dinner as soon as they leave.

122
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:15,097
What about the chicken--
- Don't worry about it, please.

123
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,197
Here. Thank you.

124
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:20,768
My bag.

125
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:25,139
There. Thank you.

126
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:31,116
l'm very displeased
with your whole attitude.

127
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:35,150
l'm terribly sorry l'm so late.

128
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:38,421
Good evening, Mrs. Hamilton.
l was delayed Christmas shopping.

129
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:40,589
Good evening, Mr. Perry, Mrs. Trumbuss.

130
00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:43,317
Hello, Mrs. Ward.

131
00:10:43,426 --> 00:10:45,328
l hope you've been having a good meeting.

132
00:10:45,428 --> 00:10:49,965
We have not. l've never encountered
such fuzzy thinking.

133
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:52,868
Do you think we've made progress?
- No, Mrs. Hamilton.

134
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:54,904
Mr. Perry was about to tell us something.

135
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:58,149
Merely a suggestion.
lf you approve...

136
00:10:58,174 --> 00:11:02,445
we can place the George B. Hamilton
chapel here on the northeast.

137
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:05,214
lt'd be out of sight.
l won't stand for it.

138
00:11:05,314 --> 00:11:09,652
This cathedral can't be designed
for the glory of an individual.

139
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,620
lt has to be created for all the people.

140
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,490
l'm displeased at your whole attitude.

141
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,126
You forget l was instrumental
in having you made bishop...

142
00:11:17,226 --> 00:11:19,161
although l thought you too young.

143
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,530
ls that an exaggeration?
- Oh, yes--

144
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,430
l mean, no.
- You were the guiding spirit.

145
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:28,170
l distinctly remember--
- l had every confidence in you...

146
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,373
when you were a poor parson
in the church in the slums.

147
00:11:30,473 --> 00:11:32,575
l confess, my confidence is weakened.

148
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:34,877
l regret l've been such a disappointment.

149
00:11:34,977 --> 00:11:37,146
Regrets and apologies are no good.

150
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:41,650
You give the impression of being
indecisive and ineffectual.

151
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,087
That is not the kind of leadership
we expect of our bishop.

152
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:49,458
You better remember one thing: You'll
build that cathedral as l want it...

153
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:51,460
or you'll not build it at all.

154
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,685
That's all l have to say.

155
00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:57,366
Someone get this dog out of the way.

156
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,466
Queenie.

157
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:02,503
Good night.

158
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,073
Good evening.
- Good night.

159
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:06,173
Good evening.

160
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:21,891
Can we serve dinner now?
- Yes.

161
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:26,921
The chicken will be burned to a crisp.
- We'll be right in.

162
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:32,668
You knew they were expected here
for the meeting this afternoon.

163
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:36,906
l know. l'm sorry l was late.
- What a ghastly afternoon.

164
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,006
What a ghastly woman.

165
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,911
l trust she understood l've no intention
of being strangled by her purse strings.

166
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,580
She did. l was proud of you.
- l had a most unchristian impulse...

167
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,616
to take those blueprints
and give her a good whack over the--

168
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:49,385
mink coat.

169
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:51,454
l thought you stood up to her magnificently.

170
00:12:51,554 --> 00:12:55,324
l appreciate your appreciation,
but what about my cathedral?

171
00:12:55,424 --> 00:12:59,128
May l make a suggestion?
Postpone the cathedral.

172
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:03,532
Forget about it until after Christmas.
- A house of God can't be put off.

173
00:13:03,632 --> 00:13:06,469
This cathedral must rise. There are
other rich people in this town...

174
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:09,038
and if l have to enlist
their financial enthusiasm...

175
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:11,040
then l'll take advantage
of their yuletide spirit.

176
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,267
l can see it all now.

177
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:19,148
Those people, the luncheons, committee
meetings and you there, flattering them.

178
00:13:19,248 --> 00:13:22,284
Kowtowing and begging them.
- lt's got to be done.

179
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,421
lf you could see your poor, harassed face.

180
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:29,325
You haven't done much to help it!
- Why-- Yes, Miss Cassaway? What is it?

181
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:31,861
Mr. Trevor on the phone.
He says it's urgent.

182
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:37,061
Tell him the bishop will call him back.
- Yes, Mrs. Brougham.

183
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,937
What's happened to you?
What's happened to us and our marriage?

184
00:13:42,037 --> 00:13:45,307
We used to have such fun,
you, Debby and l.

185
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:48,377
We used to be happy.
We used to make other people happy.

186
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:52,414
That was your gift. You're no financier
and you're not a promoter.

187
00:13:52,514 --> 00:13:55,484
You can't see beyond your nose.
l want this cathedral to stand...

188
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,486
like a great beacon,
it's light shining--

189
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:02,686
Never mind, Henry. Keep that
for your next committee meeting.

190
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:09,952
Here's a contribution l collected.

191
00:14:10,265 --> 00:14:12,468
What's that?
- An old Roman coin.

192
00:14:12,568 --> 00:14:15,604
Professor Wutheridge sent it to you.
Wasn't it sweet of him?

193
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:18,307
Old fool.
What can l do with that?

194
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:21,342
Well. lt's a beginning.

195
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:27,223
All you need is another four million.
- Don't be flippant about this!

196
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:32,585
ls dinner ready?
- Yes.

197
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:36,938
Let's get it over with.
l have a lot of work to do.

198
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:52,725
For what we're about to receive, may the
Lord make us truly thankful. Amen.

199
00:15:20,335 --> 00:15:22,204
l was just thinking...

200
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:25,704
tomorrow,
maybe we could go out together.

201
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:27,443
Where?

202
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:31,113
We'll just walk around the way we used to.

203
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,615
We could call on the professor.

204
00:15:34,616 --> 00:15:38,354
Or go to the park and watch
the skaters-- that sort of thing.

205
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:40,589
Maybe we could have lunch together.

206
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,987
At Michel's.
Remember that?

207
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:45,058
Michel's.

208
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,510
lt's been years since we've been there.

209
00:15:50,432 --> 00:15:53,302
Forgive me. l've been trying
to explain to Mr. Trevor...

210
00:15:53,402 --> 00:15:57,006
but he insists upon
speaking to you personally, Bishop.

211
00:15:57,106 --> 00:15:59,106
Excuse me, darling.

212
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:07,082
Keep the soup warm, please.
The bishop's been called to the phone.

213
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:09,418
And tell Delia
we'll be out for lunch tomorrow.

214
00:16:09,518 --> 00:16:11,518
Yes, ma'am.

215
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:15,208
Of course, Mr. Trevor.
Yes, but--

216
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,845
l appreciate your difficulties--

217
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:23,132
Very well. l'll be there.
10:30 tomorrow morning...

218
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,100
then we'll go on to the board meeting.

219
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,566
All right.
Good-bye.

220
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:31,273
Put down Mr. Trevor's office
at 10:30 tomorrow...

221
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:33,942
and the board meeting at
the bankers' club at 11:00.

222
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:37,212
Yes, sir. Tomorrow, Thursday.
- You might as well go home now.

223
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:40,249
There's a great deal of work to do.
- You must be very tired.

224
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:44,653
Thank you. And don't forget, tomorrow
you speak to the junior assembly.

225
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,922
What time is that?
- At lunch, 1:00.

226
00:16:47,022 --> 00:16:51,357
Remember, you made the appointment
over a month ago.

227
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:54,714
Good night, Bishop.
- Good night.

228
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,003
Oh, God.
What am l to do?

229
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,337
Can't you help me?
Can't you tell me?

230
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:14,540
Oh, God.
Please help me.

231
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:55,555
Good evening.
- Good--

232
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:58,651
What can l do for you?

233
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:00,863
That isn't the question.

234
00:18:00,963 --> 00:18:03,454
Well, what is?

235
00:18:03,565 --> 00:18:06,159
What can l do for you?

236
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:08,837
l must ask you to telephone
my secretary for an appointment.

237
00:18:08,937 --> 00:18:11,340
l'm in the middle of dinner.
- l know, Henry.

238
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,433
Your soup will keep warm.
You asked for help.

239
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:17,910
l? l--

240
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:20,582
Who told you?

241
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,551
Well.

242
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:25,654
You're known to be a good man
and you were heard.

243
00:18:25,754 --> 00:18:28,557
l was instructed to come here
in answer to your prayer.

244
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:30,952
Who are you?
- l'm an angel.

245
00:18:32,961 --> 00:18:36,226
l beg your pardon?
- l'm an angel.

246
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:39,868
No wings at the moment, but--
- You're an angel?

247
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:43,165
l knew it.
l've been working too hard.

248
00:18:48,644 --> 00:18:52,581
l understand.
lt's hard to believe, even for you.

249
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:55,250
Of course, l'm not
one of the more important angels.

250
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,654
l just happen to be assigned
to this district temporarily.

251
00:18:58,754 --> 00:19:00,622
You see, we're everywhere...

252
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,612
helping people who deserve to be--

253
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,628
to be helped.

254
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,398
As you walk through
the streets of the city...

255
00:19:09,498 --> 00:19:11,567
you may suddenly look into a strange face.

256
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:17,277
lt may be the face of a murderer
or it may be the face of an angel.

257
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,243
You're having problems with
the building of this cathedral?

258
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:25,143
Yes.
- lt's a fine cathedral.

259
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:29,752
lt ought to look magnificent
on top of Sanctuary Hill.

260
00:19:32,187 --> 00:19:36,351
Well, Henry. Do you believe
l am what l say l am?

261
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,160
Well, how can l?

262
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,596
l've only got your word for it.
- But you're a bishop.

263
00:19:40,696 --> 00:19:43,165
You, of all people,
can trust the word of an angel.

264
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,265
l'd like to.

265
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,100
What do you propose to do?

266
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:50,339
Perform a miracle?
- lf necessary.

267
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:54,443
Why don't you? Why don't you create
the cathedral with a wave of your hand?

268
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:57,446
You wouldn't want me to do that.
How would you explain it?

269
00:19:57,546 --> 00:20:01,216
Well, l'd--
- Tell the world an angel visited you?

270
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:03,316
You can't do that.

271
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:08,218
ls anything wrong?
l--

272
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:10,359
l'm sorry.
l didn't know that you had--

273
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:14,363
Julia, if you don't mind.
- How do you do, Julia?

274
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,500
l'm Dudley. Henry's engaged me
to help him with his work.

275
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,003
You mean you're going to be his assistant?

276
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:25,407
That's it. l'm going to help Henry
to rest and get some relaxation.

277
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:28,143
That's what l've been praying for.
- You too?

278
00:20:28,243 --> 00:20:30,243
l'm so relieved.

279
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:32,347
lsn't it wonderful
you found someone to help you.

280
00:20:32,447 --> 00:20:34,249
But--
- Where do you come from?

281
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:36,451
All around.
- Yes, but where?

282
00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:40,461
To tell you the truth,
he says that he's an a--

283
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,092
l've been doing some
social service work downtown.

284
00:20:44,192 --> 00:20:46,295
And now you're going to be
with Henry permanently?

285
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:49,115
For as long as may be necessary.

286
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,633
lf you don't mind,
l must talk to this gentleman alone.

287
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:54,031
l'll see you in a moment.

288
00:20:54,136 --> 00:20:57,105
We were just having dinner.
Won't you join us?

289
00:20:57,205 --> 00:21:00,409
That's kind of you,
but l've many things to do around town.

290
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:04,146
You understand, Henry. So many people
making so many mistakes.

291
00:21:04,246 --> 00:21:07,115
Yes, l see.
- Then we'll see you tomorrow?

292
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:09,885
Oh, yes. Bright and early.
- Good.

293
00:21:09,985 --> 00:21:12,317
Whenever you're ready.

294
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:14,421
Good night, Dudley.

295
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:16,489
Good night, Julia.

296
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,499
You sure you're an angel?

297
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:28,003
l know it isn't easy,
but you've got to take me on faith.

298
00:21:28,103 --> 00:21:31,540
But how long will it take?
- Just long enough.

299
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,345
Until you can utter another prayer
and say you have no further need of me.

300
00:21:36,445 --> 00:21:39,642
Then l'll be gone and forgotten.

301
00:21:39,915 --> 00:21:42,484
But Julia's waiting for you
at the dining table.

302
00:21:42,584 --> 00:21:44,584
You must go to her.

303
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,058
But l don't--

304
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,775
What's the rest of Dudley's name?

305
00:22:39,141 --> 00:22:41,141
l don't know.

306
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,250
Are you nervous, dear?

307
00:22:51,353 --> 00:22:53,353
No.

308
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:13,975
The bishop didn't eat his breakfast.
- He took only his prune juice.

309
00:23:14,075 --> 00:23:16,178
What's the matter?
ls he sick?

310
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:21,016
He looked awful. He said he had
a very bad, sleepless night.

311
00:23:21,116 --> 00:23:23,819
Passing up a breakfast like that.

312
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,012
That just ain't normal.

313
00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:30,031
Nobody expects him to be normal.
He's a bishop.

314
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,373
lf l could get you something, sir?
- No, thank you.

315
00:23:45,473 --> 00:23:48,477
Maybe just a cup of tea?
- Nothing, thank you.

316
00:23:48,577 --> 00:23:51,637
Good morning.
- Good morning, Bishop.

317
00:23:54,983 --> 00:23:57,285
Did anything come in
for the cathedral fund?

318
00:23:57,385 --> 00:24:00,122
Mr. and Mrs. Ward,
no contribution.

319
00:24:00,222 --> 00:24:05,353
Mrs. Wilmark, $15.00.
- We had her down for $10,000.

320
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,629
There's a letter from her explaining
that this year--

321
00:24:07,729 --> 00:24:10,664
l know.
Same letter they all write.

322
00:24:10,732 --> 00:24:14,469
l put your personal mail on the desk.
The rest l'm taking to the office.

323
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:17,374
l'll be there after the meetings.

324
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:45,000
l think there's someone at the door.

325
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,100
Yes, sir.

326
00:24:48,603 --> 00:24:52,207
Good morning.
l'm Dudley, the bishop's new assistant.

327
00:24:52,307 --> 00:24:54,276
Good morning.
lt's a wonderful morning.

328
00:24:54,376 --> 00:24:56,511
l'm a little late,
but l stopped to chat...

329
00:24:56,611 --> 00:25:00,048
with a traffic policeman
who was worried about his wife.

330
00:25:00,148 --> 00:25:02,148
Oh, thank you, dear.

331
00:25:02,217 --> 00:25:04,452
So l directed traffic
while he telephoned the hospital.

332
00:25:04,552 --> 00:25:08,147
l see.
- She's doing fine. So is the baby.

333
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:12,336
Why, you must be Mildred Cassaway.
How do you do?

334
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:17,098
We're going to be working together.
- That's very nice.

335
00:25:17,198 --> 00:25:19,393
Thank you.

336
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:22,561
Thank you very much.
- See you later.

337
00:25:24,205 --> 00:25:26,537
Well, ready for duty.

338
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,903
Completely at your service.

339
00:25:37,385 --> 00:25:39,385
l feel that--
- No.

340
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,060
Good morning, Julia.

341
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,528
Good morning, Dudley.

342
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,628
A lovely day, isn't it?

343
00:25:49,397 --> 00:25:51,433
Lovely.
- Henry and l are going out together.

344
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:54,836
l'm sorry, but l have appointments.
- You what?

345
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:58,974
l'm seeing Mr. Trevor, then the
board meeting and the junior assembly.

346
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:01,975
But you promised.
- l know l did.

347
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:05,880
Couldn't Dudley represent you
at those meetings?

348
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,039
Could l?

349
00:26:08,116 --> 00:26:11,620
Out of the question. They expect me.
lt'd never do if l sent an a--

350
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,720
An assistant.

351
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,690
Excuse me.

352
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,494
Now--

353
00:26:27,435 --> 00:26:31,172
The trouble is, l can't explain!
- You needn't try to explain.

354
00:26:31,272 --> 00:26:33,908
This is the way it is
and the way it will always be.

355
00:26:34,008 --> 00:26:36,478
We've just got to get used to it,
that's all.

356
00:26:36,578 --> 00:26:42,188
l'll tell Matilda to take the day off,
and l'll take care of Debby.

357
00:26:52,994 --> 00:26:58,867
Mrs. George Hamilton has pledged one
million dollars but hasn't sent a check.

358
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:02,070
Never mind those cards.
That's work for a bookkeeper, not an a--

359
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:07,208
lt's work for a bookkeeper.
- So, you're beginning to believe in me.

360
00:27:07,308 --> 00:27:10,178
l don't know who you are
or who it was that sent you.

361
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:13,181
l'd just wish you'd make haste.
There's no time to lose.

362
00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:15,183
Because the cathedral must be built?

363
00:27:15,283 --> 00:27:17,519
Obviously.
That's the most important thing.

364
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:20,254
Or because Julia must be happy?

365
00:27:20,288 --> 00:27:22,190
lt's going to be difficult to help you...

366
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,392
until l'm sure what it is you really want.

367
00:27:24,492 --> 00:27:26,617
l've got the-- Then the--

368
00:27:44,078 --> 00:27:46,881
Would you mind telling me
what you intend to do now?

369
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:50,852
This card index file is an awful mess.
l think l'll reorganize it.

370
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:52,987
l think you're wasting time
on unimportant details.

371
00:27:53,087 --> 00:27:59,717
Nothing's unimportant. Remember, we're
interested even in the lowliest sparrow.

372
00:28:49,077 --> 00:28:51,627
Hello, Debby.
- Are you Dudley?

373
00:28:51,713 --> 00:28:53,908
Yes. How did you know?

374
00:28:54,015 --> 00:28:57,352
Mummy told me.
She said you came to help Daddy.

375
00:28:57,452 --> 00:28:59,613
That's right.

376
00:28:59,888 --> 00:29:02,023
Mummy said you were very nice.

377
00:29:02,123 --> 00:29:04,793
Well, that's extremely kind of Mummy.

378
00:29:04,893 --> 00:29:08,897
Mummy said that maybe with you here,
we'll get to see Daddy sometimes.

379
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:12,567
Maybe we will.
- That'll be enough out of you, Debby.

380
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,570
l asked Matilda to put your lunch
on a tray for you.

381
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,906
Thank you.
l'll get along very well.

382
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,175
l'm sure you will.
Come on, dear.

383
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:23,165
Good-bye, Dudley.
- Bye-bye, Debby.

384
00:29:23,244 --> 00:29:25,244
Bye.

385
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,929
Thank you, Matilda.
- Aren't you going to wear a hat?

386
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:17,832
l never use one.
- lt's very cold outside.

387
00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:22,203
The cold never effects me.
- l think you should wear this anyway.

388
00:30:22,303 --> 00:30:25,507
l bought it for the bishop last Christmas.

389
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:28,810
But he's never worn it.
- lt's a lovely scarf.

390
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,479
l'm sure the bishop will appreciate it
when he sees it on me.

391
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,139
Well, thank you.
Good-bye.

392
00:30:56,237 --> 00:30:58,940
What's the matter, honey?
- They don't want me.

393
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,950
Why not?
- l guess l'm too little or something.

394
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,813
Now, now.

395
00:31:05,913 --> 00:31:09,317
Why, that's the most ridiculous thing
l've ever heard.

396
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:11,417
Why, Dudley.

397
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,675
Come on.
We'll show them how wrong they are.

398
00:31:22,497 --> 00:31:24,497
Hey, fellas!

399
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:29,731
Who's the head man around here?
- l am!

400
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:34,876
What's this game you're playing?
- This isn't a game. This is a battle!

401
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:38,146
We attack the fort
and they try to defend it. See?

402
00:31:38,246 --> 00:31:41,316
l see. Well, this young lady
would like to get into it.

403
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:44,986
Her?
- She can't fight. Her father's a bishop.

404
00:31:45,086 --> 00:31:48,356
What difference does it make?
Are you high-hat?

405
00:31:48,456 --> 00:31:51,259
How'd you like her on your team?
- She couldn't throw a snowball...

406
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:53,359
as far as l could spit!

407
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,890
Oh, couldn't she?
Come on.

408
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,503
You show them what you can do.
- But it's true. l can't throw.

409
00:32:02,603 --> 00:32:05,306
Nonsense. Of course you can.
Here. Pack it tight.

410
00:32:05,406 --> 00:32:07,942
Put it in that hand,
throw the arm back...

411
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:10,932
aim it right at him and let it go!

412
00:32:13,614 --> 00:32:15,383
A bull's-eye!

413
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:17,483
She pitched a curve!

414
00:32:17,585 --> 00:32:20,213
Did you see that?

415
00:32:20,321 --> 00:32:25,251
Come on, kid! You're in our army.
We've broken their moral.

416
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:34,469
You think she'll get hurt?
- Probably, but she'll love it.

417
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:36,569
May l?
- Surely.

418
00:32:40,675 --> 00:32:42,844
What are you doing out here?

419
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:47,181
Just admiring the scenery.
- Aren't you supposed to be working?

420
00:32:47,281 --> 00:32:51,956
l always take a walk before lunch.
Good idea-- relaxing.

421
00:32:52,987 --> 00:32:56,424
l wish you'd persuade Henry to do that.
- l'll try.

422
00:32:56,524 --> 00:32:58,926
By the way, l told Miss Cassaway
to go home...

423
00:32:59,026 --> 00:33:01,929
and l told Delia
not to bring me anything on the tray.

424
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:04,494
What will you do about lunch?

425
00:33:04,532 --> 00:33:07,568
l thought l'd go to Michel's.
Ever heard of it?

426
00:33:07,668 --> 00:33:11,229
Michel's?
lt's a lovely place.

427
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:13,889
We used to go there years ago.

428
00:33:13,941 --> 00:33:17,171
How about you and l going there today?

429
00:33:17,178 --> 00:33:20,375
You and-- To Mich-- No, l couldn't.

430
00:33:20,481 --> 00:33:23,584
Why not? Surely, you don't think
Henry would mind?

431
00:33:23,684 --> 00:33:26,387
l'd explain to him it'd be just--
- No, it isn't that.

432
00:33:26,487 --> 00:33:31,757
Matilda's off Christmas shopping
so l have to look after Debby.

433
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,593
Here's Matilda now.

434
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,936
lf you wish-- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

435
00:33:42,036 --> 00:33:44,038
lf you wish,
l'll take Debby home.

436
00:33:44,138 --> 00:33:47,028
But your shopping.
- l finished it.

437
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:49,811
l finished it so quick,
it was just like miracle.

438
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:51,312
Mommy!

439
00:33:51,412 --> 00:33:54,142
We won!
- That's wonderful!

440
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:56,614
Congratulations!

441
00:33:56,884 --> 00:33:59,353
Come on!
We're giving out the medals!

442
00:33:59,453 --> 00:34:01,546
Put up your hood, dear.

443
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,106
Oh, Michel.
- lt's been a long time.

444
00:34:18,206 --> 00:34:20,575
Much too long. But you know
my husband's work.

445
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:23,911
Yes, your husband.
He doesn't come to see us anymore.

446
00:34:24,011 --> 00:34:26,878
But we understand.
We understand.

447
00:34:26,948 --> 00:34:28,948
This way please.

448
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,654
ls this satisfactory?

449
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,620
Fine, thank you.

450
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:41,157
Friends of yours?
- Yes.

451
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:43,965
That is, they're members
of the cathedral committee.

452
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:45,233
Madame.
- Thank you.

453
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,068
Monsieur?
- No, thank you.

454
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,170
Julia, don't bother with that.

455
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:52,173
Michel, you just bring us
the best lunch you can think of.

456
00:34:52,273 --> 00:34:56,043
l can see monsieur is a gourmet.
Perhaps you'd be interested in...

457
00:34:56,143 --> 00:34:58,143
Guinea Hen a la Michel?

458
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,349
Please.
Let's leave heaven out of this.

459
00:35:14,462 --> 00:35:16,930
You speak French beautifully.

460
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:20,771
l've had quite a bit of work to do in Paris.

461
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:24,263
l've been wondering about you.

462
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,575
Wondering about me? Why?
- You know so much.

463
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:33,370
lt makes me feel uncomfortable.
- Then l'm sorry l learned anything.

464
00:35:33,915 --> 00:35:36,550
l'm glad you knew about Michel.

465
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:39,899
Oh, it's so nice to be back here again.

466
00:35:39,921 --> 00:35:44,221
So nice.
- You have memories of this place?

467
00:35:45,293 --> 00:35:47,562
Did you and Henry come here often?

468
00:35:47,662 --> 00:35:52,900
As a matter of fact, this is where
we became engaged to be married.

469
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,230
Then l can understand why you love it.

470
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,238
Pardon me.
- Thank you.

471
00:36:01,342 --> 00:36:04,140
Well, what about that?

472
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:07,281
My. Would you care to have
your palm read?

473
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:10,009
No, thank you.
Would you?

474
00:36:10,117 --> 00:36:12,887
No, thanks. l know too much about myself
as it is.

475
00:36:12,987 --> 00:36:15,990
You are different.
l know so little about myself.

476
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,725
Really?
May l look at your hand?

477
00:36:19,026 --> 00:36:21,495
Can you do that too?
- lt's not too difficult.

478
00:36:21,595 --> 00:36:25,433
l suppose you can read the future.
- Within limits.

479
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:28,024
He's holding her hand.

480
00:36:29,136 --> 00:36:31,136
What do you see?

481
00:36:32,206 --> 00:36:35,266
l never noticed.
Your eyes are green.

482
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:42,250
l see a great deal of happiness.
l see a woman who's adored.

483
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:45,581
l see a rich, full life.

484
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:48,489
Do you see Henry's new cathedral?
- lt's not very clear.

485
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:50,858
There's kind of a fuzziness about that.

486
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:54,273
And Debby?
- No need to worry about her.

487
00:36:54,662 --> 00:36:59,100
Just think. The world changes,
but two things remain constant.

488
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,465
What?
- Youth and beauty.

489
00:37:02,536 --> 00:37:05,106
Though they're really
one in the same thing.

490
00:37:05,206 --> 00:37:10,007
Yes. The trouble is, people grow old.
- Not everybody.

491
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:13,514
The only people who grow old
were born old to begin with.

492
00:37:13,614 --> 00:37:17,269
You were born young.
You'll remain that way.

493
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:21,079
l wish l could believe.
- You may.

494
00:37:23,357 --> 00:37:26,027
You haven't looked at my hand once.

495
00:37:26,127 --> 00:37:30,197
l never know what to think. l never know
if you're joking or serious.

496
00:37:30,297 --> 00:37:33,612
l'm at my most serious when l'm joking.

497
00:37:38,672 --> 00:37:42,497
Excuse me.
l've gotta do something about that.

498
00:37:44,045 --> 00:37:46,747
Forgive me coming to your table, ladies.
l'm Dudley.

499
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:50,484
l believe you're friends of Julia's.
Would you care to join us for lunch?

500
00:37:50,584 --> 00:37:54,555
No, thank you.
- Why don't you join us for some coffee?

501
00:37:54,655 --> 00:37:58,147
Do come over.
Julia will be delighted.

502
00:37:58,259 --> 00:38:00,591
Wonderful.

503
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,861
Just over there.

504
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,747
How are you?
Nice to see you.

505
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:15,142
Michel, bring us three Benedictines.

506
00:38:15,242 --> 00:38:17,938
No. Make it three Stingers.

507
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,045
Stingers?
Oui, monsieur.

508
00:38:34,195 --> 00:38:37,365
ls lunch ready?
- We thought you were out for lunch.

509
00:38:37,465 --> 00:38:40,001
l cancelled my appointment.
Are my wife and Debby home?

510
00:38:40,101 --> 00:38:42,937
Debby's here, sir.
- Where is Mrs. Brougham?

511
00:38:43,037 --> 00:38:46,267
She went out to lunch with Mr. Dudley.

512
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:50,841
With Dudley?
- Why, yes, sir.

513
00:38:51,512 --> 00:38:54,345
l thought you knew, sir.

514
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,415
Yes. Of course.

515
00:39:12,466 --> 00:39:15,958
That's awful.
Merry Christmas, Santa.

516
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,073
Santa Claus doesn't really look like that.

517
00:39:19,173 --> 00:39:22,009
You know Santa Claus?
- l've known him for years.

518
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:25,046
Nice chap.
- You must tell Debby about him.

519
00:39:25,146 --> 00:39:29,226
She's just beginning
to be a little bit doubtful.

520
00:39:33,554 --> 00:39:37,294
You like that hat.
- Yes. l'm crazy about it.

521
00:39:37,658 --> 00:39:41,321
Let's go in and buy it.
- No, l couldn't.

522
00:39:41,428 --> 00:39:43,898
lt's much too--
- Too what? Attractive?

523
00:39:43,998 --> 00:39:48,418
Nothing could be--
Why! My old friend, the professor.

524
00:39:49,403 --> 00:39:52,139
Are you with this man?
- Of course. lt's Dudley.

525
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:54,475
The professor knows me from
the University of Vienna.

526
00:39:54,575 --> 00:39:56,777
l've been thinking about that.

527
00:39:56,877 --> 00:39:59,180
l don't believe you've ever been to Vienna.

528
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,916
lt's a game we play.
He pretends he's never seen me before.

529
00:40:02,016 --> 00:40:04,485
l don't know who he is,
but l don't trust him.

530
00:40:04,585 --> 00:40:07,053
He's Henry's new assistant.

531
00:40:08,355 --> 00:40:10,524
You mean, you know this fella?
- Of course, l do.

532
00:40:10,624 --> 00:40:15,362
ln that case, how about dropping by
for some yuletide cheer?

533
00:40:15,462 --> 00:40:17,587
No. l have to go home.
l--

534
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:23,893
Well, perhaps just for a few minutes.
- Good! Come along.

535
00:40:28,842 --> 00:40:33,914
There's a little sherry left--
a rather inferior grade, but potable.

536
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:37,751
l see you're quite a religious man.
- What makes you think that?

537
00:40:37,851 --> 00:40:41,989
You have an angel on your tree.
- Julia gave me that years ago.

538
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:45,192
Your tree is beautiful.
- lt's disgraceful.

539
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:49,263
But it gives me the illusion
of peace on earth, goodwill toward men.

540
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:52,161
To a charming lady.
- Lovely.

541
00:40:52,266 --> 00:40:55,102
You've noticed?
- lt's more remarkable that you have.

542
00:40:55,202 --> 00:41:00,557
When you want to know about a woman,
ask the old men. They know.

543
00:41:03,344 --> 00:41:06,881
Will you show us the manuscript
of your book?

544
00:41:06,981 --> 00:41:08,782
My book?
- Please.

545
00:41:08,882 --> 00:41:11,262
Oh, no.
- You're writing one?

546
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:19,551
You didn't know?
- You didn't tell me.

547
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:24,927
l described that book in detail
at the University of Vienna.

548
00:41:25,032 --> 00:41:27,091
All my pupils knew.

549
00:41:27,201 --> 00:41:29,970
Now l'm certain this fellow's an impostor.

550
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,907
Oh, that book.
l thought you finished that years ago.

551
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:34,875
l'll tell you--

552
00:41:34,975 --> 00:41:36,977
l'll tell you about my book.

553
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,280
For 20 years l've talked about it.

554
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:43,117
l promised publishers that
it would be delivered next spring.

555
00:41:43,217 --> 00:41:46,320
Funny part is, in all that time,
l haven't written one word.

556
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,615
Not one word.
- Why not?

557
00:41:48,889 --> 00:41:51,125
l couldn't think of anything original to say.

558
00:41:51,225 --> 00:41:55,457
The same, old, monotonous history,
dry as dust.

559
00:41:58,299 --> 00:42:00,100
That's the whole story of my life.

560
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,931
Frustration.
lt's a chronic disease...

561
00:42:04,038 --> 00:42:06,097
and it's incurable.

562
00:42:07,908 --> 00:42:09,908
Once, l was madly--

563
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:20,648
Once, l was madly in love with a girl.

564
00:42:21,188 --> 00:42:25,326
My friends, she was a vision
of delight. A pure enchantress.

565
00:42:25,426 --> 00:42:28,395
You never told me about that.
- That's just the trouble.

566
00:42:28,495 --> 00:42:30,898
l never told her about it either.

567
00:42:30,998 --> 00:42:33,262
l couldn't find the words.

568
00:42:33,367 --> 00:42:36,063
So, she married an athlete.

569
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:41,015
A great hulky oaf
who never even reached the eighth grade.

570
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,577
But he knew how to say l love you.

571
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:51,049
Same trouble as my book.
Can't find the words.

572
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,490
Even when you had this coin
to inspire you?

573
00:42:57,591 --> 00:43:00,361
Why, that's the one you gave to Henry.

574
00:43:00,461 --> 00:43:03,225
Yes. l stole it off the table.

575
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,366
You wasted your time.
lt's worthless.

576
00:43:05,466 --> 00:43:09,870
On the contrary. This is one of
the rarest of all antiquities.

577
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:14,341
Only 100 of these were minted
by Julius Caesar 2,000 years ago.

578
00:43:14,441 --> 00:43:16,744
That was when Cleopatra visited Rome.

579
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,880
Presumably, these were used
to pay her hotel bill.

580
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:24,485
l never knew that.
- Nobody did, except Caesar's wife.

581
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:27,187
And she was suspicious.
- Definitely.

582
00:43:27,287 --> 00:43:31,292
She didn't share
her husband's admiration for Cleopatra.

583
00:43:31,392 --> 00:43:35,129
So she had these coins destroyed--
melted into ornaments for herself.

584
00:43:35,229 --> 00:43:37,298
This is the one she missed.

585
00:43:37,398 --> 00:43:39,400
lt's a unwritten chapter in history.

586
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,128
And you will write it.

587
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:45,172
Do you know any more stories like that?

588
00:43:45,272 --> 00:43:47,041
Any number of them.

589
00:43:47,141 --> 00:43:49,076
You're a curious fellow.

590
00:43:49,176 --> 00:43:51,478
Have you just begun to notice that?

591
00:43:51,578 --> 00:43:54,308
What's your background?

592
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:58,408
My background?
- Well, where do you come from?

593
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:00,888
Well--
- Don't tell me any more about Vienna.

594
00:44:00,988 --> 00:44:03,490
Because l won't believe it.
- All right.

595
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:06,794
Would you believe me if l told you
l came from another planet?

596
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,021
l don't know.

597
00:44:09,129 --> 00:44:10,364
l'd believe you.

598
00:44:10,464 --> 00:44:12,833
And you'd be right, Julia,
as always.

599
00:44:12,933 --> 00:44:14,968
We all come from our own little planets.

600
00:44:15,068 --> 00:44:20,678
That's why we're all different.
That's what makes life interesting.

601
00:44:33,854 --> 00:44:37,169
We don't seem to be making any headway.

602
00:44:38,158 --> 00:44:41,594
First star l see tonight--

603
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,429
You must make a wish.

604
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:49,457
lt's getting dark.
lt must be late.

605
00:44:49,503 --> 00:44:51,739
Henry will be worried.
We must be leaving.

606
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,104
Oh, no.
- l'm sorry, but we must.

607
00:44:57,878 --> 00:45:00,814
Yes, my friend.
- There's one thing that troubles me.

608
00:45:00,914 --> 00:45:03,283
One thing l wish l knew.
- What's that?

609
00:45:03,383 --> 00:45:07,121
l'm an old man and that history's
a tremendous task.

610
00:45:07,221 --> 00:45:11,180
l wonder.
Will l have time to finish it?

611
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:15,250
You'll finish your history.
You'll have time.

612
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:18,463
l believe you.

613
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,337
For a while now,
every time l passed a cemetery...

614
00:45:23,437 --> 00:45:26,667
l felt as if l were apartment hunting.

615
00:45:29,343 --> 00:45:31,343
Good-bye, Professor.

616
00:45:31,445 --> 00:45:33,714
You've given an old man
a very happy afternoon.

617
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:36,250
Thank you.
- God bless you both.

618
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:40,260
Thank you.
l'll pass that recommendation along.

619
00:46:32,506 --> 00:46:34,531
Oh, my.
That's pretty.

620
00:46:34,808 --> 00:46:40,414
Why don't you take some of that
pink stuff and make curly-cues with it?

621
00:46:40,514 --> 00:46:42,883
l hope the dinner won't be spoiled.
- No, sir.

622
00:46:42,983 --> 00:46:46,383
l had a feeling that they might be late.

623
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,289
Very considerate of you.
Who's that cake for?

624
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:52,109
What cake?
- The cake behind you.

625
00:46:53,093 --> 00:46:56,730
That cake? Oh, for anybody
who might like cake.

626
00:46:56,830 --> 00:47:00,133
But you know very well
we don't like these elaborate desserts.

627
00:47:00,233 --> 00:47:03,378
But we baked you an egg custard, sir.

628
00:47:11,845 --> 00:47:14,848
Hello, dear.
l'm sorry we're late for dinner.

629
00:47:14,948 --> 00:47:17,751
Good evening.
- We've had the most marvelous time.

630
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:19,987
l wish you'd been with us.
- l wish l had.

631
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,456
Debby told me about the snow fights.
- Did she?

632
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:26,426
We sent to see Professor Wutheridge
and then had lunch at Michel's.

633
00:47:26,526 --> 00:47:28,495
ls Debby in bed yet?
- She's waiting to see you.

634
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:31,532
Good. l'll go up and say good night.

635
00:47:31,632 --> 00:47:35,797
l won't be long.
l'll just see if she's all right.

636
00:47:38,538 --> 00:47:40,707
l trust you spent a profitable afternoon?

637
00:47:40,807 --> 00:47:44,800
Oh, yes.
Did you have a profitable afternoon?

638
00:47:47,347 --> 00:47:49,907
Not very.
l'd like to see you--

639
00:47:51,018 --> 00:47:52,352
for a moment.

640
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:54,452
Certainly.

641
00:47:57,591 --> 00:47:59,591
Excuse me.

642
00:48:10,437 --> 00:48:12,472
Can you prove to me that you are an angel?

643
00:48:12,572 --> 00:48:14,867
Proof?
You mean an document?

644
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:19,212
You, of all people should know
that an angel needs no passport.

645
00:48:19,312 --> 00:48:21,915
l want to see you perform a miracle.

646
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:26,145
What kind?
- Make the desk fly around the room.

647
00:48:26,253 --> 00:48:28,889
Please! l didn't come down here
to do silly tricks.

648
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:32,526
l'm surprised at you.
- l don't believe you're an angel.

649
00:48:32,626 --> 00:48:35,262
l think you're a demon right out of--

650
00:48:35,362 --> 00:48:37,990
Oh, Henry! Don't say that.

651
00:48:39,466 --> 00:48:41,501
Well, anyway.
You know how l feel.

652
00:48:41,601 --> 00:48:44,195
Yes.

653
00:48:44,304 --> 00:48:47,467
Wait a minute.
There's another thing.

654
00:49:29,015 --> 00:49:31,313
Dinner is served, Bishop.

655
00:49:51,505 --> 00:49:53,505
Thank you.

656
00:49:57,110 --> 00:50:03,485
For what we are about to receive, may
the Lord make us truly thankful. Amen.

657
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,812
Pass the celery, Henry.
Please.

658
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,598
The celery.

659
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,274
Thank you.

660
00:50:57,904 --> 00:51:00,199
What's that you're humming?

661
00:51:00,273 --> 00:51:03,163
l don't know, dear.
ls it anything?

662
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:05,838
lt's rather gay.
- l feel gay.

663
00:51:12,219 --> 00:51:15,534
l like to watch you brushing your hair.

664
00:51:15,856 --> 00:51:18,425
Thank you, dear.
ls that a compliment?

665
00:51:18,525 --> 00:51:21,153
Yes. You do it so capably.

666
00:51:22,462 --> 00:51:24,462
Well, thank you.

667
00:51:28,401 --> 00:51:30,303
ln fact, now that l think of it...

668
00:51:30,403 --> 00:51:32,868
everything you do is capable.

669
00:51:34,541 --> 00:51:38,912
The one thing l pride myself on is that
we lead a well-ordered life.

670
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,447
The family, l mean.

671
00:51:40,547 --> 00:51:44,457
Of course, that's due to you
much more than me.

672
00:51:45,318 --> 00:51:49,143
l think you're an excellent wife.
- Thank you.

673
00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:52,225
Do you think l'm an excellent husband?
- Of course.

674
00:51:52,325 --> 00:51:55,495
We're having supper early
so we can get to St. Timothy's on time.

675
00:51:55,595 --> 00:51:58,498
St. Timothy's?
- Choir rehearsal for the benefit.

676
00:51:58,598 --> 00:52:02,864
Oh, yes.
- You've been looking very tired lately.

677
00:52:02,936 --> 00:52:06,239
l hope you'll take it easier
now that Dudley's here.

678
00:52:06,339 --> 00:52:09,797
l think that he's very able.
- You do?

679
00:52:12,178 --> 00:52:15,415
He knows so many things.
- What, for instance?

680
00:52:15,515 --> 00:52:18,118
You should have seen him
with Professor Wutheridge.

681
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,921
He knows more about history
than the professor.

682
00:52:21,021 --> 00:52:23,922
He'd been at it longer.

683
00:52:36,436 --> 00:52:39,806
Let's do that again.
- No! Tell me a story.

684
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:42,142
Now?
- Don't you know any stories?

685
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:45,512
l know hundreds of stories.
- Tell me one. Please!

686
00:52:45,612 --> 00:52:47,944
All right.
Let me think.

687
00:52:48,048 --> 00:52:50,050
Now this happened many, many years ago.

688
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:52,419
That's not the way to begin.

689
00:52:52,519 --> 00:52:54,754
Stories start, ' Once upon a time.'

690
00:52:54,854 --> 00:52:57,791
Yes, that's true.
Well, once upon a time...

691
00:52:57,891 --> 00:53:00,360
there was a little boy
who lived in a little town.

692
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,896
What was his name?
- His name was David.

693
00:53:02,996 --> 00:53:06,199
He was a shepherd and the town
where he lived was called Bethlehem.

694
00:53:06,299 --> 00:53:09,369
l know Bethlehem.
That's where the star was.

695
00:53:09,469 --> 00:53:12,739
That's right.
Only, David lived long before the star.

696
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,842
One night, he was out in the hills
tending his sheep.

697
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:21,481
He was playing the harp and singing.
- Was he singing ' Jingle Bells'?

698
00:53:21,581 --> 00:53:23,483
'Jingle Bells' hadn't been written then.

699
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:26,152
He was singing songs he wrote himself.

700
00:53:26,252 --> 00:53:29,456
Suddenly, an angel came down
and spoke to David.

701
00:53:29,556 --> 00:53:33,059
How did David know it was an angel?
- He didn't know.

702
00:53:33,159 --> 00:53:35,061
You know, that's the way it always is.

703
00:53:35,161 --> 00:53:37,497
Angels come and put ideas
into peoples' heads.

704
00:53:37,597 --> 00:53:39,499
Then people feel proud of themselves...

705
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,902
because they think it was all their own idea.

706
00:53:42,002 --> 00:53:44,368
This angel said to David...

707
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,740
'One of your lambs has strayed.'

708
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:50,877
David put aside his harp and went
into the darkness to find his lamb.

709
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,879
Of course, the angel guided him.

710
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:58,315
When David found the lamb,
he saw a great, big, ferocious lion.

711
00:53:58,418 --> 00:53:59,819
Oh!

712
00:53:59,919 --> 00:54:03,189
David said to the lion,
'You get away from that lamb!'

713
00:54:03,289 --> 00:54:07,027
And the lion said,
'Get away from me or l'll eat you too!'

714
00:54:07,127 --> 00:54:10,460
Did David run away?
- No. You know why?

715
00:54:10,563 --> 00:54:13,166
Because the angel put another idea
into his head.

716
00:54:13,266 --> 00:54:16,269
David took out his sling
and he hurled his stone...

717
00:54:16,369 --> 00:54:18,705
and hit the lion right between the eyes.

718
00:54:18,805 --> 00:54:21,933
l bet that lion was surprised!

719
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:25,679
And so was David. Because he didn't know
an angel had helped him.

720
00:54:25,779 --> 00:54:28,882
Well, he picked up the lamb
and took it back to the fold.

721
00:54:28,982 --> 00:54:32,218
He felt so happy,
he made up another song.

722
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:37,756
lt started out, ' The Lord
is my shepherd, l shall not want.

723
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,393
'He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures:

724
00:54:40,493 --> 00:54:43,808
'He leadeth me beside the still waters.

725
00:54:44,597 --> 00:54:46,929
'He restoreth my soul.'

726
00:54:48,301 --> 00:54:52,505
You can tell the rest of this, Henry.
- Some other time.

727
00:54:52,605 --> 00:54:54,605
Hello, Daddy.

728
00:54:55,975 --> 00:55:00,735
Miss Cassaway, please get
Mrs. Hamilton on the telephone.

729
00:55:01,014 --> 00:55:05,519
Get Mrs. Hamilton on the phone, please!
- Yes, Bishop.

730
00:55:06,352 --> 00:55:08,488
Good morning, Julia.
- Good morning.

731
00:55:08,588 --> 00:55:11,491
l'll see you in a minute.
l have to see Matilda now.

732
00:55:11,591 --> 00:55:14,141
Bye, Debby.
- Good-bye, Dudley.

733
00:55:23,103 --> 00:55:25,435
Thank you.
- Oh, pretty.

734
00:55:27,474 --> 00:55:30,377
Are you expecting a letter?
- One never knows.

735
00:55:30,477 --> 00:55:33,413
But if l should get one,
the stamp would be worth saving.

736
00:55:33,513 --> 00:55:37,450
l have Mrs. Hamilton in a moment, sir.
- Are you seeing her today?

737
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:41,885
l hope to.
- May l come along? l'd like to meet her.

738
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,795
Hello, Mrs. Hamilton.
How are you?

739
00:55:48,895 --> 00:55:53,025
l'm glad to hear it.
l'd like to see you today.

740
00:55:53,133 --> 00:55:55,533
This afternoon, if possible.

741
00:55:55,768 --> 00:55:58,148
Yes, it is.
lt's very urgent.

742
00:55:59,506 --> 00:56:02,407
That's too bad.
- That's terrible.

743
00:56:04,077 --> 00:56:06,117
You can?
That's splendid.

744
00:56:07,147 --> 00:56:09,416
Thank you so much.
l'll be there.

745
00:56:09,516 --> 00:56:13,145
5:00 this evening.
Thank you. Good-bye.

746
00:56:13,253 --> 00:56:16,289
You didn't make an appointment
for this afternoon, did you?

747
00:56:16,389 --> 00:56:20,026
lt was the only possible time.
- You can't do this to Reverend Miller.

748
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,128
That rehearsal's being held just for you.

749
00:56:22,228 --> 00:56:25,999
They'll get along without me, and
there are other things more important.

750
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:31,104
He'll be delighted to see you.
- lt isn't the same. You're his bishop.

751
00:56:31,204 --> 00:56:33,329
l don't like going alone.

752
00:56:49,455 --> 00:56:53,059
lt's the big house
at the end of this street, Driver.

753
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:55,787
Dudley, l take it that--

754
00:56:55,895 --> 00:56:59,524
that you have the money for the taxi?

755
00:56:59,799 --> 00:57:03,029
No. What makes you think l have money?

756
00:57:03,069 --> 00:57:06,436
l just thought that,
you being an ang--

757
00:57:06,539 --> 00:57:08,539
Goodness!

758
00:57:09,442 --> 00:57:11,774
l'm sorry.
- Sorry.

759
00:57:22,322 --> 00:57:24,322
Thank you.

760
00:57:31,064 --> 00:57:33,399
l may be in time to join you before too long.

761
00:57:33,499 --> 00:57:35,935
Please try.
- l'll see you in front of the church...

762
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,137
in exactly one hour.

763
00:57:37,237 --> 00:57:40,070
Try.
- l will be there.

764
00:57:40,173 --> 00:57:42,971
Good.
- This is it, Driver.

765
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:07,300
Good evening, Bishop Brougham.
- How are you, Stevens?

766
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,969
Mrs. Hamilton is in the drawing room, sir.

767
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:12,069
Thank you.

768
00:58:20,013 --> 00:58:22,013
Well, Bishop Brougham.

769
00:58:23,316 --> 00:58:25,752
My dear Mrs. Hamilton,
l've come to tell you--

770
00:58:25,852 --> 00:58:28,688
You've come to apologize, l trust.
- Exactly.

771
00:58:28,788 --> 00:58:31,691
Upon mature consideration,
my objections seem petty...

772
00:58:31,791 --> 00:58:33,893
compared with your generous gesture.

773
00:58:33,993 --> 00:58:37,096
l'm very relieved. Sit down, Bishop.
- Thank you.

774
00:58:37,196 --> 00:58:40,300
What hurt me most was to think
that my instinct had betrayed me...

775
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,136
in recommending you
for the position you now hold.

776
00:58:43,236 --> 00:58:45,171
l am unceasingly grateful.

777
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:48,408
Now, in planning the cathedral
l'm taking it for granted...

778
00:58:48,508 --> 00:58:51,477
that the George B. Hamilton
Memorial Chapel shall be located--

779
00:58:51,577 --> 00:58:53,846
Just where you specified, Mrs. Hamilton.

780
00:58:53,946 --> 00:58:55,848
You don't feel the effect will be lost...

781
00:58:55,948 --> 00:58:58,251
if the whole cathedral
was built in my husband's honor?

782
00:58:58,351 --> 00:59:01,955
l said that in the heat of a dispute.
What matters is that it be built.

783
00:59:02,055 --> 00:59:06,993
Good. l will not have his name
in some horrid little brass plaque.

784
00:59:07,093 --> 00:59:10,129
No, it will be in marble
with large, gilded letters.

785
00:59:10,229 --> 00:59:14,133
Now, the large window depicting
St. George and the dragon.

786
00:59:14,233 --> 00:59:19,673
l should like St. George's countenance
suggest my late husband's.

787
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,440
And the dragon?

788
00:59:22,875 --> 00:59:26,106
Any dragon.
Let's get the blueprints.

789
00:59:26,946 --> 00:59:29,315
Mrs. Hamilton, since we're now
in agreement...

790
00:59:29,415 --> 00:59:32,285
would you mind if we postpone
the discussion of the details?

791
00:59:32,385 --> 00:59:34,988
Julia's waiting at St. Timothy's.
- Very well.

792
00:59:35,088 --> 00:59:37,824
We can go over the plans
when we send for the funds.

793
00:59:37,924 --> 00:59:42,089
Thank you. l'm glad we've settled
our differences.

794
00:59:46,065 --> 00:59:48,065
ls anything the matter?

795
00:59:48,067 --> 00:59:50,447
lt doesn't seem quite right.

796
00:59:53,139 --> 00:59:54,340
Stevens!

797
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:58,520
There's something wrong
about the bishop's chair.

798
00:59:59,245 --> 01:00:01,814
Madame, it must be the new varnish.

799
01:00:01,914 --> 01:00:04,889
The finisher should have warned us.

800
01:00:05,818 --> 01:00:08,788
l hope l'm not harming the chair.
- Not at all.

801
01:00:08,888 --> 01:00:12,324
Call a furniture shop or a plumber.

802
01:00:12,425 --> 01:00:14,427
Turpentine. Do something, Stevens.
- Yes, ma'am.

803
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:17,860
Oh, dear.
- l wonder--

804
01:00:17,964 --> 01:00:21,619
Will you give it a little pull at the back?

805
01:00:33,012 --> 01:00:34,247
Thank you.

806
01:00:34,347 --> 01:00:36,783
'Benefit. Help Save St. Timothy's'

807
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,652
lt's been a long time
since Henry's been here.

808
01:00:39,752 --> 01:00:41,913
l wish he had come.

809
01:00:41,988 --> 01:00:45,458
When he was here,
he was so close to people.

810
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,558
So loved by everybody.

811
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,858
How does it seem now?

812
01:00:49,962 --> 01:00:55,232
That the cathedral has moved him away
from the people he loved?

813
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:58,404
Reverend Miller will be disappointed
not to see him.

814
01:00:58,504 --> 01:01:00,504
He doesn't have to be.

815
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:06,946
Hello, Mr. Miller.
- So good of you to come, Mrs. Brougham.

816
01:01:07,046 --> 01:01:08,781
l'm delighted to be here.

817
01:01:08,881 --> 01:01:10,817
This is Mr. Dudley,
the bishop's new assistant.

818
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:13,078
A pleasure.
- Thank you.

819
01:01:13,186 --> 01:01:16,823
The bishop will try to get here later.
Something important came up.

820
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,915
Oh. Of course, he's a busy man.

821
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:24,430
This is Mrs. Duffy.
- l know her. How are you?

822
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:26,966
lt's always an honor to have you here
at St. Timothy's.

823
01:01:27,066 --> 01:01:29,168
Thank you. This is Mr. Dudley.

824
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:30,737
Mrs. Duffy is the organist.

825
01:01:30,837 --> 01:01:34,173
l'm sure she plays enchantingly.
Hello, Mrs. Duffy.

826
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:38,183
l'm afraid some of our boys are a little late.

827
01:01:38,511 --> 01:01:41,681
We should begin but
l don't see how we can.

828
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:43,840
lt's quite embarrassing.

829
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:48,955
lt is a little difficult to compete
with basketball and Christmas.

830
01:01:49,055 --> 01:01:51,858
They're all good boys at heart.
- l know.

831
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:54,338
They'll show up.
- l hope so.

832
01:01:55,761 --> 01:01:57,761
Hello, Bobby.
- Hello.

833
01:01:58,498 --> 01:02:01,033
What do you sing?
- First soprano.

834
01:02:01,133 --> 01:02:03,513
Are you good?
- l don't know.

835
01:02:03,569 --> 01:02:06,204
How about giving a--
- Me alone?

836
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:09,675
You've got George. Hello, George.
- Hello.

837
01:02:09,775 --> 01:02:11,800
What do you say?
- Okay.

838
01:02:13,112 --> 01:02:14,881
Are you ready, Mrs. Duffy?
- Oh, yes.

839
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,981
Hit it.

840
01:02:19,252 --> 01:02:22,221
O sing to God

841
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:25,449
Your hymns of gladness

842
01:02:25,525 --> 01:02:27,525
Ye loving hearts

843
01:02:27,527 --> 01:02:30,189
Your tribute make

844
01:02:30,296 --> 01:02:35,825
Your Lord is born this happy day

845
01:02:35,902 --> 01:02:41,204
Then pierce the sky with songs of gladness

846
01:02:41,274 --> 01:02:45,472
Disperse the chains of gloom and sadness

847
01:02:45,745 --> 01:02:48,213
The Lord is born

848
01:02:48,314 --> 01:02:50,805
This happy day

849
01:02:50,917 --> 01:02:52,917
O Sing to Him

850
01:02:52,919 --> 01:02:55,911
Your hymns of gladness

851
01:02:55,988 --> 01:02:59,048
O sing to God

852
01:02:59,158 --> 01:03:02,093
Your hymns of gladness

853
01:03:02,194 --> 01:03:06,756
Ye loving hearts your tribute make

854
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:09,198
Your Lord is born

855
01:03:09,302 --> 01:03:12,328
This happy day

856
01:03:12,438 --> 01:03:17,466
Then pierce the sky with songs of gladness

857
01:03:17,743 --> 01:03:22,146
Disperse the shades of gloom and sadness

858
01:03:22,248 --> 01:03:24,512
Your Lord is born

859
01:03:24,784 --> 01:03:27,252
This happy day

860
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,320
O sing full out

861
01:03:29,422 --> 01:03:33,017
Your hymns of gladness

862
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:35,821
O Word of God

863
01:03:35,928 --> 01:03:38,863
For us incarnate

864
01:03:38,965 --> 01:03:41,092
O Word of God

865
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,328
For us incarnate

866
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:48,965
By faith we hear Thine angels sing

867
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:58,216
Their hymns
- Angels sing their hymns

868
01:03:58,317 --> 01:04:01,912
Of praise to Thee their King

869
01:04:01,988 --> 01:04:06,925
We join with them in adoration

870
01:04:12,531 --> 01:04:16,399
We pour We pour to Thee

871
01:04:16,502 --> 01:04:20,302
Our supplication

872
01:04:20,406 --> 01:04:23,000
That Thou wouldst

873
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:26,374
Grant us Lord

874
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:32,350
Salvation

875
01:04:40,893 --> 01:04:43,384
Boys, that was beautiful.

876
01:04:43,496 --> 01:04:45,496
Really beautiful.

877
01:04:45,998 --> 01:04:50,436
You've all grown up so since
the bishop and l lived in this parish.

878
01:04:50,536 --> 01:04:53,403
l hardly recognized any of you.

879
01:04:53,506 --> 01:04:55,506
l'm so proud of you.

880
01:04:55,541 --> 01:04:57,907
l know he will be to.

881
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:00,010
Thank you.

882
01:05:00,012 --> 01:05:02,281
Mr. Miller, that was wonderful.

883
01:05:02,381 --> 01:05:05,248
l can't thank you enough.

884
01:05:05,317 --> 01:05:09,907
And you, Mr. Dudley.
- l'm sorry the bishop isn't here.

885
01:05:13,192 --> 01:05:16,062
Are you all right?
- Yes. Thank you.

886
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:18,426
What is keeping Stevens?

887
01:05:18,531 --> 01:05:20,531
Stevens, there you are.

888
01:05:20,533 --> 01:05:24,637
l'm sorry but the furniture shop
is closed until after New Year's.

889
01:05:24,737 --> 01:05:27,974
l can't find a plumber.
We're out of turpentine.

890
01:05:28,074 --> 01:05:32,409
This is preposterous.
- What about some witch hazel?

891
01:05:32,945 --> 01:05:35,881
May l use your telephone?
- Of course. lt's over there.

892
01:05:35,981 --> 01:05:37,981
Thank you.

893
01:05:51,163 --> 01:05:53,199
Tilda, this is Bishop Brougham.

894
01:05:53,299 --> 01:05:58,909
Will you bring a pair of my trousers
over to Mrs. Hamilton's house?

895
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:02,975
What difference does it make?
Just bring me another pair of trousers.

896
01:06:03,075 --> 01:06:05,236
Thank you.

897
01:06:05,344 --> 01:06:08,745
l'm so sorry this has happened.

898
01:06:08,848 --> 01:06:11,283
lf only l could contact Julia or Dudley.

899
01:06:11,383 --> 01:06:13,508
Don't be nervous, Bishop.

900
01:06:15,254 --> 01:06:17,056
Have a chair.

901
01:06:17,156 --> 01:06:19,156
Thank you, l have one.

902
01:06:26,966 --> 01:06:28,100
He isn't here.

903
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,370
Perhaps the meeting was
more important than he thought.

904
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:33,470
l suppose.

905
01:06:34,306 --> 01:06:36,306
We'd better go home.

906
01:06:39,545 --> 01:06:41,647
Dudley, it's strange thing.

907
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:43,747
What's strange?

908
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:47,687
You make me feel as if everything
is going to be all right.

909
01:06:47,787 --> 01:06:50,017
lt could be if--
- lf what?

910
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:56,080
lf people could only learn
to behave like human beings.

911
01:06:57,863 --> 01:06:59,863
Hey, taxi.

912
01:07:06,739 --> 01:07:08,739
Here's a cab.

913
01:07:10,309 --> 01:07:12,211
Will you please wait, Sylvester?

914
01:07:12,311 --> 01:07:14,311
Sure, mister.

915
01:07:14,313 --> 01:07:16,313
Sylvester?

916
01:07:23,088 --> 01:07:26,025
Good evening. l'll be right with you.

917
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:29,328
This is one of our most exclusive models.

918
01:07:29,428 --> 01:07:31,896
lt's lovely.
Simply ravishing!

919
01:07:31,997 --> 01:07:33,766
So chic, so young.

920
01:07:33,866 --> 01:07:36,836
lt is sweet, isn't it?
- lt's stunning.

921
01:07:36,936 --> 01:07:42,461
Not everyone could wear such a daring
hat. lt was made for madame.

922
01:07:57,957 --> 01:08:01,984
How did you know
my name was Sylvester?

923
01:08:02,094 --> 01:08:04,858
lt's up there on your card.

924
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:10,369
Could you drive us
through the park, please?

925
01:08:10,469 --> 01:08:12,138
That's out of your way.

926
01:08:12,238 --> 01:08:14,940
Sylvester,
are you getting bored with us?

927
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:18,711
Oh, no. l'll drive you
to Mexico City, if you want.

928
01:08:18,811 --> 01:08:20,811
Thank you.

929
01:08:22,448 --> 01:08:24,448
l'm having so much fun.

930
01:08:25,284 --> 01:08:26,652
Are you?
- Yes.

931
01:08:26,752 --> 01:08:30,189
Are you really?
- l feel as if l'm doing something bad.

932
01:08:30,289 --> 01:08:32,289
Why?
- l don't know.

933
01:08:33,259 --> 01:08:35,928
l seems wrong to have so much fun but...

934
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:38,997
l can't figure out why.

935
01:08:39,064 --> 01:08:42,434
You folks know
what's wrong with this country?

936
01:08:42,534 --> 01:08:45,304
l've heard several versions of that.

937
01:08:45,404 --> 01:08:48,271
Do you know?
- l think l do.

938
01:08:49,241 --> 01:08:51,944
Too many people who don't know
where they're going...

939
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:54,680
and they want to get there too fast.

940
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:58,011
Take you two.
l'd call you unusual.

941
01:08:58,083 --> 01:09:00,973
Thank you. You're very perceptive.

942
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:05,057
You know your destination
but are in no hurry to get there.

943
01:09:05,157 --> 01:09:08,060
You want to enjoy some scenery en route.

944
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,396
And you're not reluctant to spend
an extra four bits...

945
01:09:10,496 --> 01:09:13,216
for a detour with Mother Nature.

946
01:09:13,866 --> 01:09:15,906
Look where you're going!

947
01:09:18,037 --> 01:09:20,369
Well, my goodness.

948
01:09:20,472 --> 01:09:23,309
Did you see the way l missed that truck?

949
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:28,339
lt was like a miracle.
- Yes, but don't overplay your hand.

950
01:09:39,792 --> 01:09:41,727
Sylvester, pull up here.

951
01:09:41,827 --> 01:09:43,028
We're going skating.

952
01:09:43,128 --> 01:09:45,731
We mustn't. lt's late.
We couldn't.

953
01:09:45,831 --> 01:09:48,767
Do you think we could?
- Henry can wait a little longer.

954
01:09:48,867 --> 01:09:51,502
Yeah.
- Sylvester, stop the car.

955
01:09:57,810 --> 01:09:59,678
l am wicked.
- lf you are, so am l.

956
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:02,081
And that's impossible.
Can you skate?

957
01:10:02,181 --> 01:10:04,809
l used to but l'm too old now.

958
01:10:04,917 --> 01:10:09,422
Put on some skates.
You'll find out how young you are.

959
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:31,081
l don't know about this.

960
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:52,329
Relax. That's right.

961
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:07,010
Pretty hat.

962
01:11:39,111 --> 01:11:41,477
Why, Dudley!
- Now you.

963
01:11:41,747 --> 01:11:43,840
Oh, no. l--
- Come on.

964
01:11:52,324 --> 01:11:56,744
Dudley, this is heaven.
- You found the perfect word.

965
01:12:19,151 --> 01:12:21,210
Look what l'm doing!

966
01:12:22,788 --> 01:12:27,208
You're a beautiful skater.
ln fact, you're beautiful.

967
01:12:34,466 --> 01:12:36,798
Look at Sylvester!

968
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:43,140
Now, Sylvester.

969
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:08,967
Excuse me.
- Sure.

970
01:13:09,067 --> 01:13:11,262
Keep cool, Sylvester!

971
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:15,472
Relax.

972
01:13:17,743 --> 01:13:19,743
That's right. Come on.

973
01:13:19,845 --> 01:13:22,147
Give me the other one.
That's it.

974
01:13:22,247 --> 01:13:24,841
Relax. No, not collapse.

975
01:13:28,854 --> 01:13:30,854
Hang on to me.

976
01:13:37,362 --> 01:13:39,796
Don't leave me!

977
01:13:55,013 --> 01:13:57,013
How am l doing, Dudley?

978
01:14:10,162 --> 01:14:12,162
Wait for me!

979
01:15:00,946 --> 01:15:02,946
Thank you, Dudley.

980
01:15:02,948 --> 01:15:06,118
How much do l owe you?
- Not a cent, my friend.

981
01:15:06,218 --> 01:15:10,022
My pockets are bulging with the coins
of self-satisfaction.

982
01:15:10,122 --> 01:15:12,191
Know why?
- l'd love to know.

983
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:16,595
Because you two have restored
my faith in human nature.

984
01:15:16,695 --> 01:15:18,764
Good night, Dudley and Julia.

985
01:15:18,864 --> 01:15:22,774
Good night, Sylvester.
- Good night, Sylvester.

986
01:15:27,172 --> 01:15:29,107
Sylvester is a noble soul.

987
01:15:29,207 --> 01:15:34,913
His children and his children's children
will rise up and call him blessed.

988
01:15:35,013 --> 01:15:37,916
This has been the most wonderful
evening l've had in years.

989
01:15:38,016 --> 01:15:42,087
This has been the most wonderful
evening l've had in centuries.

990
01:15:42,187 --> 01:15:46,692
l hope l haven't left the key--
- Go on in. lt's open.

991
01:15:48,694 --> 01:15:51,063
Hello, Queenie.
- Hello, Queenie. How are you?

992
01:15:51,163 --> 01:15:52,898
Can l help you?
- Yes, please.

993
01:15:52,998 --> 01:15:55,367
All right.
- Oh! You got my shoe.

994
01:15:55,467 --> 01:15:58,095
Hello, Henry.
- Well, Henry.

995
01:15:58,170 --> 01:16:00,939
l thought you were going to meet us
at St. Timothy's.

996
01:16:01,039 --> 01:16:02,608
What happened to you?

997
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:05,911
Can l take that?
- Thank you. You'll never guess.

998
01:16:06,011 --> 01:16:07,913
We went skating.
- The coat--

999
01:16:08,013 --> 01:16:10,013
There you are.

1000
01:16:10,248 --> 01:16:12,968
See you in a minute.
- All right.

1001
01:16:14,019 --> 01:16:16,788
Skating?
- Yes. Dudley's a marvelous skater.

1002
01:16:16,888 --> 01:16:19,191
He made me imagine that l was good.

1003
01:16:19,291 --> 01:16:23,795
You should have heard the boys
at St. Timothy's. lt was heavenly.

1004
01:16:23,895 --> 01:16:26,365
l'm sure of that.
- Did you have a successful meeting?

1005
01:16:26,465 --> 01:16:28,465
Did you?
- Satisfactory.

1006
01:16:28,467 --> 01:16:32,717
Good. l want to see Debby
before she goes to sleep.

1007
01:16:33,972 --> 01:16:36,241
You haven't said a word about it.
- About what?

1008
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:38,468
My new hat.

1009
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:44,645
What do you think?
- Charming.

1010
01:16:45,484 --> 01:16:47,949
Thank you.
l'll be right down.

1011
01:16:49,721 --> 01:16:52,658
l know that Julia is
absolutely blameless in this.

1012
01:16:52,758 --> 01:16:55,694
Of course she is.
- You stopped me from joining you.

1013
01:16:55,794 --> 01:16:58,285
Julia had a very good time.

1014
01:16:58,397 --> 01:17:00,397
l didn't.

1015
01:17:01,466 --> 01:17:04,336
lf you'd sent me to Mrs. Hamilton's
l would have gone.

1016
01:17:04,436 --> 01:17:07,139
You didn't.
So l went with your wife.

1017
01:17:07,239 --> 01:17:10,724
ls that part of the normal duties of an--

1018
01:17:14,913 --> 01:17:16,281
Of an angel?

1019
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:20,686
Sometimes angels must rush in
where fools fear to tread.

1020
01:17:20,786 --> 01:17:24,951
l don't know what that means
and don't explain it.

1021
01:17:27,159 --> 01:17:29,027
You can go now.

1022
01:17:29,127 --> 01:17:31,163
l've solved my problem.
- Have you?

1023
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:34,066
Mrs. Hamilton is giving the money
for the cathedral.

1024
01:17:34,166 --> 01:17:36,401
That was a foregone conclusion...

1025
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:40,581
if you were willing to sacrifice
your principles.

1026
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:46,205
Don't you think this glorious edifice
is worth it?

1027
01:17:47,345 --> 01:17:49,810
l'm not so sure of its glory.

1028
01:17:49,881 --> 01:17:52,372
You're not?
- No, l'm not.

1029
01:17:53,752 --> 01:17:56,154
These are lean years for the world.

1030
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:59,917
So many people need food and shelter.

1031
01:18:00,025 --> 01:18:03,850
That big roof could make
so many little roofs.

1032
01:18:03,895 --> 01:18:08,133
We're dealing with a materialistic
woman who doesn't care about that.

1033
01:18:08,233 --> 01:18:10,233
Did you try?

1034
01:18:11,303 --> 01:18:14,023
lt's all arranged.
lt's finished.

1035
01:18:14,105 --> 01:18:17,175
You came so that l could have
a cathedral. Now l want you to go.

1036
01:18:17,275 --> 01:18:20,590
Get out of my life and away from Julia.

1037
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:25,369
Pray for that. lt was
your prayer that brought me here.

1038
01:18:47,506 --> 01:18:50,742
That was no prayer.
- lt was right from my heart.

1039
01:18:50,842 --> 01:18:53,647
l want you to go.
- Julia doesn't.

1040
01:18:55,247 --> 01:18:57,247
Get out!

1041
01:18:59,084 --> 01:19:02,687
Julia's coming back.
Don't let her see you like that.

1042
01:19:02,787 --> 01:19:04,787
Try to calm yourself.

1043
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:22,007
Debby wants to say good night to Dudley.

1044
01:19:22,107 --> 01:19:23,375
Where is he?
- He's gone.

1045
01:19:23,475 --> 01:19:25,685
Where?
- How should l know?

1046
01:19:26,878 --> 01:19:29,047
Why did he leave?
- l got rid of him.

1047
01:19:29,147 --> 01:19:32,014
l fired him.
- Why?

1048
01:19:32,117 --> 01:19:36,452
He's incompetent
and l can't stand the sight of him!

1049
01:20:04,683 --> 01:20:08,678
Mummy, l'm sure that Dudley's
never coming back.

1050
01:20:09,254 --> 01:20:11,857
Darling, you must never say never.

1051
01:20:11,957 --> 01:20:13,957
Where is he?

1052
01:20:14,459 --> 01:20:16,459
Come here, dear.

1053
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:21,391
Listen to me.

1054
01:20:21,499 --> 01:20:24,236
Dudley wouldn't leave
without saying a word.

1055
01:20:24,336 --> 01:20:27,906
Beside, he promised to tell you
about Santa Claus.

1056
01:20:28,006 --> 01:20:30,006
He knows him very well.

1057
01:20:31,443 --> 01:20:33,993
But it's almost Christmas Eve.

1058
01:20:34,846 --> 01:20:36,781
Soon l'll have to go to bed.

1059
01:20:36,881 --> 01:20:39,684
l told you he wouldn't leave
without saying a word.

1060
01:20:39,784 --> 01:20:41,920
Would he, Matilda?
- Oh, no.

1061
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:45,012
That wouldn't be like Mr. Dudley.

1062
01:20:45,123 --> 01:20:48,126
Come along, Debby.
l'll get you ready for dinner.

1063
01:20:48,226 --> 01:20:51,992
Will you come see me later?
- Of course.

1064
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:16,922
Here is the list of your calls.

1065
01:21:17,022 --> 01:21:19,357
Ending at Mrs. Hamilton's.
- Thank you.

1066
01:21:19,457 --> 01:21:22,594
Miss Cassaway, here is the manuscript
to my Christmas sermon.

1067
01:21:22,694 --> 01:21:26,898
l shall want the original
and five carbons for the press.

1068
01:21:26,998 --> 01:21:31,673
lf you finish before l come back,
leave them on my desk.

1069
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:36,007
l'm sorry to keep you so long
on Christmas Eve.

1070
01:21:36,107 --> 01:21:39,099
l understand.
lt must be done.

1071
01:21:41,713 --> 01:21:44,008
l'm ready to start out now.

1072
01:21:44,716 --> 01:21:47,861
We're going to the Trubb-Shaws,
then--

1073
01:21:49,754 --> 01:21:51,779
Then to the Van Dovers.

1074
01:21:51,890 --> 01:21:53,930
Good-bye, Miss Cassaway.

1075
01:22:05,103 --> 01:22:07,435
Sylvester!
- Hello, Julia.

1076
01:22:07,672 --> 01:22:08,974
What are you doing here?

1077
01:22:09,074 --> 01:22:13,078
l've been waiting about an hour
hoping for another skating party.

1078
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:15,280
l didn't want to miss it.
Where's Dudley?

1079
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:17,760
You got a preacher with you.

1080
01:22:18,683 --> 01:22:20,683
Oh, l know!

1081
01:22:20,752 --> 01:22:23,727
You and Dudley are getting married!

1082
01:22:24,055 --> 01:22:27,359
Sylvester, this is my husband,
Bishop Brougham.

1083
01:22:27,459 --> 01:22:29,893
How do you do?
- Oh.

1084
01:22:31,329 --> 01:22:33,329
247 North Maple.

1085
01:22:38,937 --> 01:22:41,098
247 North Maple.

1086
01:22:57,021 --> 01:22:59,021
Mildred.
- Oh!

1087
01:23:01,192 --> 01:23:03,854
Dudley, it's you.
l didn't see--

1088
01:23:03,928 --> 01:23:06,865
Where have you been?
We've been worrying about you.

1089
01:23:06,965 --> 01:23:09,627
And poor Mrs. Brougham.

1090
01:23:09,734 --> 01:23:12,804
What about her?
- She's been in and out of here all day.

1091
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:15,740
Asking if we've seen or heard from you.

1092
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,977
Where is she?
- She and the bishop are making calls...

1093
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:21,542
finishing at Mrs. Hamilton's.

1094
01:23:24,382 --> 01:23:26,885
l'll type this for you.
- Oh, no.

1095
01:23:26,985 --> 01:23:28,319
You go.
- The bishop told me--

1096
01:23:28,419 --> 01:23:33,094
lt's almost Christmas Eve.
You must have shopping to do.

1097
01:23:33,158 --> 01:23:35,649
Go on.
- Thank you, Dudley.

1098
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:40,198
Merry Christmas, Mildred.

1099
01:23:40,298 --> 01:23:42,338
Merry Christmas, Dudley.

1100
01:24:14,032 --> 01:24:16,032
Take a sermon.

1101
01:24:17,335 --> 01:24:22,265
Tonight, l want to tell you the story
of an empty stocking.

1102
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:26,811
Once upon a midnight clear,
there was a child's cry.

1103
01:24:26,911 --> 01:24:29,214
A blazing star hung over a stable...

1104
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:31,683
and wise men came with birthday gifts.

1105
01:24:31,783 --> 01:24:33,118
Have you got that?

1106
01:24:33,218 --> 01:24:36,855
Good. We haven't forgotten that night
down the centuries.

1107
01:24:36,955 --> 01:24:40,325
We celebrate it with stars hung
on the Christmas tree and bells...

1108
01:24:40,425 --> 01:24:43,019
and gifts, especially gifts.

1109
01:24:43,127 --> 01:24:47,689
We buy them, wrap them
and put them under the tree.

1110
01:24:47,799 --> 01:24:51,030
You give me a tie.
l give you a book.

1111
01:24:51,135 --> 01:24:54,764
Aunt Martha wants an orange squeezer.

1112
01:24:54,839 --> 01:24:57,474
Uncle Harry can use a new pipe.

1113
01:25:00,311 --> 01:25:03,906
We forget nobody, adult or child.

1114
01:25:04,015 --> 01:25:05,617
All the stockings are filled.

1115
01:25:05,717 --> 01:25:07,717
All except one.

1116
01:25:33,077 --> 01:25:37,248
l'm sorry, Matilda.
- Mr. Dudley, l knew you'd come back.

1117
01:25:37,348 --> 01:25:40,151
l knew you hadn't walked out on us.

1118
01:25:40,251 --> 01:25:41,653
Of course not.

1119
01:25:41,753 --> 01:25:44,656
Debby's been so worried
and Mrs. Brougham--

1120
01:25:44,756 --> 01:25:47,592
Run upstairs.
Tell Debby l'll see her later.

1121
01:25:47,692 --> 01:25:51,007
l have some work to do.
- l'll tell her.

1122
01:26:37,008 --> 01:26:39,101
One moment, please.

1123
01:26:39,210 --> 01:26:41,946
ls Mrs. Hamilton expecting you?
- No, but she'll want to see me.

1124
01:26:42,046 --> 01:26:46,317
l'm the bishop's assistant.
- You're not expected, but the bishop is.

1125
01:26:46,417 --> 01:26:49,987
l told you, Stevens,
she'll wish to see me.

1126
01:28:20,211 --> 01:28:24,015
'This was composed for you,
my darling, and you only. Allan.'

1127
01:28:24,115 --> 01:28:26,665
Her husband's name was George.

1128
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:32,675
Good evening.

1129
01:30:34,111 --> 01:30:36,491
That music you were playing.

1130
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:39,784
l'm the only one living
that knows that composition.

1131
01:30:39,884 --> 01:30:41,786
lt's a shame that we're the only ones...

1132
01:30:41,886 --> 01:30:44,122
who appreciate the lost genius of
Allan Cartwright.

1133
01:30:44,222 --> 01:30:47,055
You know about him?
- Oh, yes.

1134
01:30:47,158 --> 01:30:51,833
The world lost a brilliant,
young composer when he died.

1135
01:30:52,230 --> 01:30:56,792
That was forty years ago.
You couldn't have known him.

1136
01:30:58,035 --> 01:31:02,030
l'm older than you think.
Come, let us sit down.

1137
01:31:07,945 --> 01:31:11,175
What is your name?
- My name is Dudley.

1138
01:31:13,884 --> 01:31:16,751
Tell me about Allan and you.

1139
01:31:23,661 --> 01:31:25,661
Tell me.

1140
01:31:28,132 --> 01:31:32,042
Allan Cartwright
was the only man l ever loved.

1141
01:31:33,170 --> 01:31:35,720
We were engaged to be married.

1142
01:31:36,007 --> 01:31:38,007
l got frightened.

1143
01:31:38,809 --> 01:31:42,079
He had nothing and l was afraid of poverty.

1144
01:31:42,179 --> 01:31:44,179
He went away.

1145
01:31:45,783 --> 01:31:47,783
l never saw him again.

1146
01:31:49,387 --> 01:31:51,937
l never loved George Hamilton.

1147
01:31:51,956 --> 01:31:54,292
He was very much in love with me.

1148
01:31:54,392 --> 01:31:56,392
He was wealthy.

1149
01:31:58,229 --> 01:32:03,244
l've spent a fortune honoring
his memory in empty monuments.

1150
01:32:13,244 --> 01:32:15,846
The Hamilton mansion.
Never been here before.

1151
01:32:15,946 --> 01:32:18,883
What do l owe you?
- No charge. l'm not busy.

1152
01:32:18,983 --> 01:32:23,148
Thank you, Sylvester.
- l'll be seeing you, Julia.

1153
01:32:30,094 --> 01:32:32,863
That must be Henry and Julia at the door.

1154
01:32:32,963 --> 01:32:36,626
The bishop! l can't see him now.

1155
01:32:36,734 --> 01:32:39,066
Oh, yes, you will.
- No!

1156
01:32:39,136 --> 01:32:41,136
Yes.

1157
01:32:42,707 --> 01:32:47,637
Just go out and greet them
in you usual warmhearted manner.

1158
01:32:51,349 --> 01:32:55,429
The Bishop and Mrs. Brougham
are calling, madame.

1159
01:33:00,424 --> 01:33:04,164
You'll stay for dinner?
- l'm afraid l can't.

1160
01:33:04,228 --> 01:33:06,228
l have work to do.

1161
01:33:06,230 --> 01:33:09,205
Don't keep Henry and Julia waiting.

1162
01:33:21,112 --> 01:33:23,577
How do you do, Mrs. Hamilton?

1163
01:33:24,081 --> 01:33:27,056
How nice of you to come and see me.

1164
01:33:28,753 --> 01:33:30,753
Merry Christmas.

1165
01:33:32,123 --> 01:33:34,758
Let's go into the drawing room.

1166
01:33:40,898 --> 01:33:46,508
Merry Christmas to you too.
- Oh, we're old friends. Call me Agnes.

1167
01:33:47,238 --> 01:33:49,238
You too, Julia, dear.

1168
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:51,240
Yes, of course.

1169
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:58,080
But he's gone already.

1170
01:33:58,616 --> 01:34:00,616
Who?

1171
01:34:02,186 --> 01:34:04,221
He was here.
- l should have known it.

1172
01:34:04,321 --> 01:34:08,159
Where did he go?
- The poor man had so much work to do.

1173
01:34:08,259 --> 01:34:10,161
You must make him take some rest.

1174
01:34:10,261 --> 01:34:12,261
l've been trying to.

1175
01:34:12,263 --> 01:34:16,167
l can't thank you enough
for sending him to me. But sit down.

1176
01:34:16,267 --> 01:34:21,806
Meeting Dudley has been the greatest
spiritual experience of my life.

1177
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:23,074
l'm so glad.

1178
01:34:23,174 --> 01:34:25,870
How did you find him?

1179
01:34:25,943 --> 01:34:28,079
lt was an accident.
- lt was a miracle.

1180
01:34:28,179 --> 01:34:33,194
lndeed. Talking with this
wonderful, understanding man has--

1181
01:34:34,151 --> 01:34:37,121
l've changed my mind about the cathedral.

1182
01:34:37,221 --> 01:34:41,292
My money's going to those who need it.
The poor and the homeless.

1183
01:34:41,392 --> 01:34:45,726
The unappreciated people here
and around the world.

1184
01:34:45,830 --> 01:34:48,999
l want you to direct
the spending of the money.

1185
01:34:49,099 --> 01:34:51,836
You see what Dudley has done?
- l see.

1186
01:34:51,936 --> 01:34:55,931
Now you understand--
- Thank you, Mrs. Hamilton.

1187
01:34:56,307 --> 01:34:59,143
l'll be home later for dinner, or something.

1188
01:34:59,243 --> 01:35:01,643
l don't know what--

1189
01:35:01,745 --> 01:35:03,745
Good-bye.

1190
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:52,060
Hello, Professor.

1191
01:35:53,163 --> 01:35:55,203
Come in, my dear fellow.

1192
01:35:56,166 --> 01:35:58,269
Sit down.
Let me take your coat.

1193
01:35:58,369 --> 01:36:00,963
No, thanks.
- Not there. Here.

1194
01:36:01,071 --> 01:36:03,174
This is the only reliable chair.

1195
01:36:03,274 --> 01:36:07,005
This is a surprise and an honor.

1196
01:36:07,111 --> 01:36:09,013
We must have a glass of sherry.

1197
01:36:09,113 --> 01:36:11,308
No, thank you.
- l insist.

1198
01:36:11,415 --> 01:36:14,111
l want to show you something.

1199
01:36:14,184 --> 01:36:17,321
You see this bottle and note that it is full?

1200
01:36:17,421 --> 01:36:18,989
Watch.

1201
01:36:19,089 --> 01:36:25,209
This is inexplicable even to you with
your vast ecclesiastical knowledge.

1202
01:36:27,765 --> 01:36:30,100
Observe that it is still full.

1203
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:33,704
How do you account for that?
And the sherry.

1204
01:36:33,804 --> 01:36:37,001
lt stimulates, warms and inspires.

1205
01:36:37,107 --> 01:36:40,311
But no matter how much you drink,
it never inebriates.

1206
01:36:40,411 --> 01:36:43,811
l can account for it.
Dudley's been here.

1207
01:36:44,949 --> 01:36:46,217
And that's not all.

1208
01:36:46,317 --> 01:36:48,919
He told me some things about history
that opened my eyes.

1209
01:36:49,019 --> 01:36:53,190
Today l went to the university library
and read some ancient texts...

1210
01:36:53,290 --> 01:36:56,727
which have been undecipherable
to living scholars.

1211
01:36:56,827 --> 01:37:00,194
Suddenly, l could understand them.

1212
01:37:00,297 --> 01:37:03,968
And this is what l have done,
thanks to Dudley.

1213
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:07,231
l'm actually writing my history.

1214
01:37:07,338 --> 01:37:12,268
Let's face it. Dudley is no
mortal man like the rest of us.

1215
01:37:12,776 --> 01:37:14,835
ls he?

1216
01:37:14,945 --> 01:37:17,709
How did you know?
- l can't tell.

1217
01:37:17,815 --> 01:37:20,251
What is he?
- He says he's an angel.

1218
01:37:20,351 --> 01:37:23,751
An angel.
- Nothing stopped me that time.

1219
01:37:23,821 --> 01:37:26,724
From heaven?
- That l'm not sure about.

1220
01:37:26,824 --> 01:37:28,824
An angel.

1221
01:37:29,193 --> 01:37:31,998
Too bad. He's such a nice fellow.

1222
01:37:32,963 --> 01:37:34,963
l should have known.

1223
01:37:34,965 --> 01:37:37,234
Nothing less could have put me to work.

1224
01:37:37,334 --> 01:37:39,236
l'm glad he's done somebody some good.

1225
01:37:39,336 --> 01:37:41,305
He's brought nothing but disaster for me.

1226
01:37:41,405 --> 01:37:44,742
That's absurd. He and Julia
were here the other day.

1227
01:37:44,842 --> 01:37:49,213
She seemed happy, quite like
her old, delightful self.

1228
01:37:49,313 --> 01:37:52,716
She's a different person
when she's with him.

1229
01:37:52,816 --> 01:37:54,941
He's made her despise me.

1230
01:37:55,719 --> 01:37:58,381
Are you sure he has done that?

1231
01:37:58,656 --> 01:38:01,158
You think it's my fault?
- l didn't say that.

1232
01:38:01,258 --> 01:38:04,528
This is a mystery
beyond my powers of comprehension.

1233
01:38:04,628 --> 01:38:06,997
l suppose l am to blame for everything.

1234
01:38:07,097 --> 01:38:10,412
l asked for this in more ways than one.

1235
01:38:10,934 --> 01:38:17,479
Dudley's presence only confirmed that
l'd already lost Julia and Debby's love.

1236
01:38:18,742 --> 01:38:21,178
l must confess, my old friend.

1237
01:38:21,278 --> 01:38:23,828
You generously sent me a coin.

1238
01:38:23,847 --> 01:38:28,185
And l only saw its commercial value.
Now l don't know where it is.

1239
01:38:28,285 --> 01:38:30,753
l do. Here it is.

1240
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:36,594
Where did you find it?
Don't tell me.

1241
01:38:36,694 --> 01:38:41,565
And what's more he told me what it is.
A museum piece. Worth a fortune.

1242
01:38:41,665 --> 01:38:45,269
You keep it. Give it to Julia
as my Christmas present.

1243
01:38:45,369 --> 01:38:47,805
lt might bring luck to you both.

1244
01:38:47,905 --> 01:38:50,507
lt seems strange, you a bishop...

1245
01:38:50,607 --> 01:38:52,977
and me, a broken-down, old scholar.

1246
01:38:53,077 --> 01:38:55,012
l feel terribly sorry for you.

1247
01:38:55,112 --> 01:38:57,376
l wish l could help.

1248
01:38:57,648 --> 01:39:00,551
There's nothing to be done.
- There must be.

1249
01:39:00,651 --> 01:39:03,587
You and Julia have always
loved each other.

1250
01:39:03,687 --> 01:39:05,322
That's only partially true.

1251
01:39:05,422 --> 01:39:07,791
l love Julia--
- Then fight for her.

1252
01:39:07,891 --> 01:39:09,259
How can l?

1253
01:39:09,359 --> 01:39:11,862
You have a tremendous advantage.

1254
01:39:11,962 --> 01:39:15,065
Advantage over an angel?
- That's precisely it.

1255
01:39:15,165 --> 01:39:17,968
He's an angel.
Julia is a creature of earth.

1256
01:39:18,068 --> 01:39:21,265
She's a woman and you are a man.

1257
01:39:33,217 --> 01:39:36,754
lsn't it beautiful?
He did every bit of it himself.

1258
01:39:36,854 --> 01:39:41,621
So quick too.
l couldn't believe my eyes.

1259
01:39:41,725 --> 01:39:46,094
What a blessing he's been.
- The tree's lovely.

1260
01:39:46,196 --> 01:39:50,768
l'm glad you like it. lt's been years
since l've decorated a tree.

1261
01:39:50,868 --> 01:39:54,353
l usually get the more disagreeable jobs.

1262
01:39:57,274 --> 01:39:58,776
Good night, Matilda.

1263
01:39:58,876 --> 01:40:02,021
Sweet dreams.
- Thank you, Mr. Dudley.

1264
01:40:12,890 --> 01:40:15,192
l think my work here is almost finished.

1265
01:40:15,292 --> 01:40:17,624
l'll have to be going.

1266
01:40:20,898 --> 01:40:23,128
Where will you be going?

1267
01:40:23,233 --> 01:40:25,667
Wherever they send me.

1268
01:40:25,736 --> 01:40:27,736
Who are they?

1269
01:40:28,338 --> 01:40:30,670
My superior officers.

1270
01:40:31,775 --> 01:40:35,142
Will we ever see you again?

1271
01:40:36,313 --> 01:40:38,849
They seldom send us
to the same place twice.

1272
01:40:38,949 --> 01:40:41,159
We might form attachments.

1273
01:40:42,386 --> 01:40:46,220
l don't understand.
- Of course not.

1274
01:40:51,361 --> 01:40:53,741
l don't want to leave.
- Why?

1275
01:40:55,065 --> 01:40:58,168
There are few people who know the
secret of making a heaven here on Earth.

1276
01:40:58,268 --> 01:41:00,268
You are one of them.

1277
01:41:04,308 --> 01:41:08,972
l think you should go.
- Please don't send me away.

1278
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:15,615
What are you saying?
- l'm tired of wandering.

1279
01:41:15,719 --> 01:41:21,839
l'm tired of existing where one is
neither hot nor cold, hungry nor full.

1280
01:41:26,763 --> 01:41:29,926
You must go away and never come back.

1281
01:41:52,055 --> 01:41:56,727
l've never fought an angel, but take off
your coat and put up your dukes.

1282
01:41:56,827 --> 01:41:59,207
Why do you want to fight me?

1283
01:42:01,064 --> 01:42:05,836
Because you tried to steal my wife,
my child, the love that belongs to me.

1284
01:42:05,936 --> 01:42:07,838
Don't you realize that as an angel...

1285
01:42:07,938 --> 01:42:10,908
l could destroy you with a bolt of lightning?

1286
01:42:11,008 --> 01:42:13,710
l don't care. Julia means
more to me than my life.

1287
01:42:13,810 --> 01:42:15,810
l'm not gonna lose her.

1288
01:42:18,682 --> 01:42:21,657
Then l have news for you.
l'm going.

1289
01:42:24,955 --> 01:42:27,651
l'll accept that when l see it.

1290
01:42:27,758 --> 01:42:29,059
No, you won't.

1291
01:42:29,159 --> 01:42:34,031
Because when l go you'll never know
an angel visited your house.

1292
01:42:34,131 --> 01:42:38,033
What about Julia?
- She won't remember either.

1293
01:42:38,101 --> 01:42:41,841
Nor will Debby, the professor
or anyone else.

1294
01:42:43,206 --> 01:42:45,834
l don't trust you.
- You may.

1295
01:42:45,943 --> 01:42:48,779
Because your prayer has been answered.

1296
01:42:48,879 --> 01:42:52,516
That's not true.
l was praying for a cathedral.

1297
01:42:52,616 --> 01:42:55,710
No, you were praying for guidance.

1298
01:42:55,819 --> 01:42:58,114
That has been given to you.

1299
01:43:04,861 --> 01:43:06,861
Just a minute, please.

1300
01:43:07,965 --> 01:43:09,965
Good-bye, Henry.

1301
01:43:16,707 --> 01:43:19,943
lf we need you again,
will you come back?

1302
01:43:20,043 --> 01:43:21,278
Not l.

1303
01:43:21,378 --> 01:43:25,048
l should ask to be assigned
to the other end of the universe.

1304
01:43:25,148 --> 01:43:28,140
Because l was so difficult?

1305
01:43:28,251 --> 01:43:30,153
This difficulty was in me.

1306
01:43:30,253 --> 01:43:36,373
When an immortal envies the mortal
entrusted to him it's a danger signal.

1307
01:43:36,626 --> 01:43:39,930
Take her in your arms and hold her tight.

1308
01:43:40,030 --> 01:43:42,030
Coming.

1309
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,805
Kiss her for me, you lucky Henry.

1310
01:44:36,386 --> 01:44:38,386
She's asleep.

1311
01:44:41,058 --> 01:44:43,058
Are you all right?

1312
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:45,960
Of course l am.

1313
01:44:47,230 --> 01:44:49,525
Did you get that for Debby?

1314
01:44:55,372 --> 01:44:58,347
l can't imagine where it came from.

1315
01:45:09,352 --> 01:45:11,616
Why, Henry. What is it?

1316
01:45:12,956 --> 01:45:14,956
l don't know. l--

1317
01:45:15,025 --> 01:45:19,615
l just have the most inexplicable
feeling of happiness.

1318
01:45:19,729 --> 01:45:21,098
You know something?
- What?

1319
01:45:21,198 --> 01:45:23,133
There's a big bowl of cider downstairs.

1320
01:45:23,233 --> 01:45:24,901
That's for tomorrow afternoon.

1321
01:45:25,001 --> 01:45:27,561
Let's drink it now. To us.

1322
01:45:27,671 --> 01:45:29,573
To our happiness and what lies ahead.

1323
01:45:29,673 --> 01:45:33,498
Then let's smash the glasses
in the fireplace.

1324
01:45:33,743 --> 01:45:35,743
Listen.

1325
01:45:37,781 --> 01:45:40,586
That's coming from St. Timothy's.

1326
01:45:41,318 --> 01:45:45,022
Let's have the cider
after your Christmas Eve sermon.

1327
01:45:45,122 --> 01:45:47,283
Oh, my sermon.
- Yes.

1328
01:45:47,357 --> 01:45:49,357
That's better still.

1329
01:45:51,027 --> 01:45:55,794
Ring the bells in adoration

1330
01:46:01,037 --> 01:46:04,529
We pour We pour to Thee

1331
01:46:04,641 --> 01:46:08,168
Our supplication

1332
01:46:08,278 --> 01:46:10,644
That Thou wouldst

1333
01:46:10,747 --> 01:46:13,614
Grant us Lord

1334
01:46:13,717 --> 01:46:19,622
Salvation

1335
01:46:33,737 --> 01:46:36,139
Tonight l want to tell you the story...

1336
01:46:36,239 --> 01:46:38,239
of an empty stocking.

1337
01:46:41,211 --> 01:46:43,736
Once upon a midnight clear...

1338
01:46:43,813 --> 01:46:45,853
there was a child's cry.

1339
01:46:47,851 --> 01:46:50,911
A blazing star hung over a stable...

1340
01:46:51,788 --> 01:46:55,018
and wise men came with birthday gifts.

1341
01:46:55,926 --> 01:46:58,995
We haven't forgotten that night
down the centuries.

1342
01:46:59,095 --> 01:47:02,065
We celebrate it with stars
on Christmas trees...

1343
01:47:02,165 --> 01:47:05,480
with the sound of bells and with gifts.

1344
01:47:06,002 --> 01:47:08,163
Especially with gifts.

1345
01:47:09,072 --> 01:47:11,072
You give me a book.

1346
01:47:11,074 --> 01:47:13,269
l give you a tie.

1347
01:47:13,376 --> 01:47:17,005
Aunt Martha wants an orange squeezer.

1348
01:47:17,113 --> 01:47:20,708
Uncle Henry can use a new pipe.

1349
01:47:21,818 --> 01:47:24,912
We forget nobody, adult or child.

1350
01:47:25,021 --> 01:47:27,615
All the stockings are filled.

1351
01:47:27,724 --> 01:47:31,023
All, that is, except one.

1352
01:47:32,162 --> 01:47:35,893
And we have even forgotten to hang it up.

1353
01:47:35,999 --> 01:47:39,628
A stocking for the child born in a manger.

1354
01:47:39,703 --> 01:47:42,763
lt's His birthday we're celebrating.

1355
01:47:42,872 --> 01:47:45,807
Let's not ever forget that.

1356
01:47:45,909 --> 01:47:48,139
Let us ask ourselves...

1357
01:47:48,245 --> 01:47:51,112
what He would wish for most.

1358
01:47:51,214 --> 01:47:54,206
And then let each put in his share.

1359
01:47:55,919 --> 01:48:00,253
Loving kindness, warm hearts...

1360
01:48:00,357 --> 01:48:04,088
and the stretched-out hand of tolerance.

1361
01:48:04,194 --> 01:48:08,104
All the shining gifts
that make peace on earth.
