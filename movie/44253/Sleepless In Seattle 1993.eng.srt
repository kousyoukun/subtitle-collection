        bathed in weeks
        and he stinks.

398

give him a little gift
for New Year's Eve.

says, "My dad needs a wife."

And the shrinkette

    talking about his wife

     fell in love with her

about how much
he loved his wife

480

I was crying.

481

It's what happens
when I watch those
phone company ads.

I don't have to see

gives the mother
the refrigerator

                 With the glue.
                 That kills me.

490
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:42,452
           You should write
           something about this.

491
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:45,588
        -About what?
        -Whatever it is.

2,000 women

for a husband?

493
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,460
A lot of desperate women
are looking for love.

494
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,162
                 Especially over
                 a certain age.

495
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,997
It's easier to be killed

00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,099
than it is
to get married over 40.

00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,667
That statistic
is not true.

498
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,135
                  That's right.
                  It's not true.

499
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:01,905
      -But it feels true.
      -Because it is true.

500
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,540
         There's practically
         a whole book

501
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:04,908
        about how that statistic
        is not true.

502
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,142
      Calm down.
      You brought it up.

503
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,778
          I did not. Did you
          even read that book?

504
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,947
Did anybody read that book
all the way through?

505
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:14,818
             Are you finished?
             Now, where were we?

506
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,152
    If someone is a widower

507
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,188
     why do they say
     that he was widowed?

508
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,592
       Why don't they say
       he was widowered?

509
00:24:23,494 --> 00:24:26,062
     I was just wondering.

510
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:28,498
           What was that about
           up there?

511
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,866
        What was what?

512
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,234

00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:46,902
           You fell in love
           with the tree man?

914
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:50,338
I did not say "love."
Did I say "love"?

915
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:54,042
This is my favorite part.

916
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:56,912
It's now or never.

924
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:23,872
                        I know.

925
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:29,044
            JONAH:
         Mommy! Mommy!

926
00:47:29,345 --> 00:47:31,479
    -Mommy!
    -It's okay. It's okay.

927
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:33,615
           -I'm here.
           -Dad!

928
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:34,583
          I'm coming.

929
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:38,420
It's all right.
It's okay. It's okay.

930
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:41,089
It's okay.
It's all right.

931
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:42,390
What was that about, hmm?

932
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,459
        -It was sinking.
        -What was?

933
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:47,929
          Our house.
          There was water coming
          in all the windows.

934
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:49,931
    Oh.

935
00:47:50,967 --> 00:47:53,268
It's okay now.

936
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,237
It's all right.

937
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,271
So what should we do?

938
00:47:56,273 --> 00:48:02,611
Your mother used to sing
to you when you had bad dreams.

939
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:06,982
           "Bye-bye, blackbird."

940
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:08,049
    Yeah.

941
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,484
               I miss her.

942
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:14,623
      What do you think happens
      to someone after they die?

943
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:15,423
I don't know.

944
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:19,494
          Like, do you believe
          in heaven?

945
00:48:22,198 --> 00:48:23,932
I never did.

946
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:29,104
Or the whole idea
of an afterlife,
but now I don't know

947
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:33,208
'cause I have these dreams
about her...

948
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:36,244
about your mom...

949
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:40,949
and we have long talks...

950
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:44,319
about you,
how you're doing.

951
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:48,990
She sort of knows,
but I tell her anyway.

952
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:52,060
So what is that?

953
00:48:52,495 --> 00:48:55,263
It's sort
of an afterlife, isn't it?

954
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,700
     I'm starting to forget her.

955
00:49:01,437 --> 00:49:05,106
   Oh, no.

956
00:49:14,216 --> 00:49:19,187
She could peel an apple

957
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:24,159
in one long, curly strip.

958
00:49:25,594 --> 00:49:27,228
The whole apple.

 named Dr. Marcia Fieldstone?

985
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:22,577
 I'm a writer for the Baltimore
 Sun and a friend of
 Laurie Johnson.

  I'm doing a piece on how
  people handle bereavement.

995
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:25,466
              either by midnight

1003
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:45,787
        -Great.
        -Do I look okay?

1004
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:48,990
     I look stupid. I look
   like I'm trying too hard.

1005
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:52,827
    I was going to get a haircut
    but then I'd just look
    like I got a haircut.

00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:54,362
          This is a good letter.

1007
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:55,630
         These shoes
         are grotesque.

1008
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:57,699
     I look like I'm trying
     to be tall.

1009

             Right.

01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:31,412
   and then it turned out
   the guy lived in Duluth.

1184
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:33,047
Where is Duluth?

1185
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:34,515
    That doesn't make any sense.

1186
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:35,516
        I know, Walter.

1187
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:37,418
       It doesn't make
       any sense at all.

1188
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,054
       Thank god my life
       is in place.

1189
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:44,125
          Duluth. That's in,
          uh, North Dakota.

1190
01:02:57,506 --> 01:02:59,340
      I love this letter.

1191
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:01,842
   You have to write to her.

1192
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:03,244
                   You think so?

1193
01:03:03,246 --> 01:03:04,845
          It's Y-O-H.

1194
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:07,047
              Yeah. What's that?

1195
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:09,383
        Your only hope.

1196
01:03:20,128 --> 01:03:22,863
I thought I would look
into doing a story

1197
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:24,265
on those radio shows.

1198
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:28,469
         You'd probably have
         to go somewhere
         to really look into it.

1199
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,504
Definitely.

1200
01:03:48,924 --> 01:03:50,858
              Couldn't you do
              a phone interview?

1201
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:53,327
          Not for the kind
          of piece I want to do.

1202
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,863
          I won't be in Chicago
          that long.

1203
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:57,865
When you get back,
I'll be gone.

1204
01:03:57,867 --> 01:04:00,534
           And then I'll see you
           in New York.

1205
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:03,337
     I'll get it. I'll...

       -He's good at it.

1225
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:02,129
   I read an article about this.

        at the age of eight.

Well, maybe when I come back

1228
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:11,639
the two of us ought to spend
some time together on our own.

1233
01:05:25,587 --> 01:05:30,324
               Jonah...
               listen to me.

1234
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:31,959
        You don't know Victoria.

1235
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:33,360
                I hardly
                know her myself.

1236
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:36,196
                She is, in fact,
                a mystery to me.

1237
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:40,100
           She tosses her hair.
           Why does she do this?

1238
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:40,968
                 I have no idea.

1239
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:42,202
        Is it a twitch?
        Does she need a haircut?

1240
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:47,408
       Should she use a barrette
       to keep her hair
       out of her face?

1241
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:51,045
    These are things I'm willing
    to get to the bottom of

1242
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:55,950
             and that is why
             I am dating her.

1243
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,551
           That's all I'm doing.

1244
01:05:57,553 --> 01:06:00,621
        I'm not living with her.
        I'm not marrying her.

1245
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:04,491
              Can you appreciate
              the difference?

1246
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,060
               This is what
               single people do.

1247
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:08,395
        They try other people on
        and see how they fit.

1248
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:11,665
  But everybody's an adjustment.
  Nobody's perfect.

1249
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:16,704
           There's no such thing
           as a perfect...

1250
01:06:31,486 --> 01:06:34,254
                   Come on.

1251
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:38,692
Dad, I was talking to Jessica
about reincarnation.

1252
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:41,161
She says you knew Annie
in another life.

1253
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,497
    -Who's Annie?
    -The one who wrote us.

1254
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,466
            But Jessica says
            you and Annie

1255
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:46,633
           never got together
           in that life

1256
01:06:46,635 --> 01:06:49,570
      so your hearts
      are like puzzles
      with missing pieces

1257
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:52,706
and when you get together,
the puzzle's complete.

1258
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:53,674
                  Goddamn it.

1259
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,542
The reason I know this
and you don't

1260
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:57,011
is because
I'm younger and pure

1261
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,780
so I'm more in touch
with cosmic forces.

1262
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:02,616
   -Who told you this stuff?
   -Jessica.

1263
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:07,154
    I sincerely hope
    you're not marrying Jessica.
