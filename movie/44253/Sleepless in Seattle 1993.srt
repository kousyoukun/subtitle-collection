7
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,470
There was nothing anybody could do.

00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:50,540

53
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:24,960
Eventually, in a few months,you'll start seeing women.

75
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:06,700
And when two lovers woo

77
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:09,640

79
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,710

97
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:49,310
That no one can deny

98
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,650
 

99
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:53,450

100
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:53,590
 

101
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:56,490
A fight for love and glory

103
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:59,530

108
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:11,340
 

109
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:15,240
Goes by

113
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:33,920

Bees. I'm allergic to bees.

172

173
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:27,170
Harold is allergic.to every type of bee.

174
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:27,280
 

175
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:31,180
We always have to carry a hypodermic.of adrenaline wherever we go.

176
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,250
 

177
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,650
If he eats even.one tiny piece of a nut...

178
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:33,750
 

179
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,180
My head swells up like.a watermelon, and I drop dead.

180
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,290
 

181
00:07:37,299 --> 00:07:39,950
It's the same.with Harold and bees.

182
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,090
 

183
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:44,520
Your mother and I had salmon at our.wedding. A wedding without cold salmon...

184
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:44,660
 

185
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:47,590
- I'm not allergic to salmon.- Oh, he's not allergic to salmon.

186
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:47,700
 

187
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:50,220
I don't think,but you never know.

188
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:50,330
 

189
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:53,890
- You never know.- Harold wasn't always allergic to bees.

190
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:54,000
 

191
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:57,900
Honey, what a shame. We had.some champagne. What did we use it for?

192
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:58,010
 

193
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,240
- Uncle Milton's parole.- And it was delicious.

194
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:00,340
 

195
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:02,000
It was, wasn't it, Milton?

196
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:02,110
 

197
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:04,100
When are you getting married?

198
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:04,180
 

199
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:07,410
- In early June, in the garden.- Does it have to be in the garden?

200
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:07,520
 

201
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:11,140
- What a great idea.- What about Harold and bees?

202
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:11,250
 

203
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:14,590
- I'm allergic to bees.- We'll spray you.

204
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:14,720
 

205
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:18,520
Cold salmon, a lovely.cucumber salad, strawberries.

206
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:18,630
 

207
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,060
I'm afraid I am allergic.to strawberries.

208
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:22,200
 

209
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,360
Allergic to strawberries.

210
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:24,470
 

211
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,590
Is this all right.with you, Walter?

212
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:27,700
 

213
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:30,030
Today I consider myself.the luckiest...

214
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:30,140
 

215
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:33,870
m-m-man on the f-f-face.of the E-E-Earth.

216
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:33,980
 

217
00:08:33,989 --> 00:08:37,240
The Lou Gehrig line.Remember? Remember, Dad?

218
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:37,310
 

219
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:39,470
- The Lou Gehrig line from...- Pride of the Yankees.

220
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:39,580
 

221
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:41,710
- Pride of the Yankees!.- Pride of the Yankees.

222
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:41,820
 

223
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:45,220
- It's baseball.- A historical reference.

224
00:08:45,229 --> 00:08:45,320
 

225
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:50,150
I would like to propose a toast.to my kid sister.

226
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:50,260
 

227
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:52,990
To Walter and my baby.

228
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:53,090
 

229
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:56,000
To Walter and Annie.

230
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:57,730
 

231
00:08:57,739 --> 00:09:01,570
Everyone, please eat.before it gets cold.

232
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:04,140
 

233
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:05,940
Here it is.

234
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:06,040
 

235
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:10,030
The historical society wanted this,and I never would give it to them.

236
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:10,140
 

237
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,310
Oh, Mom!

238
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:12,380
 

239
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:15,010
I noticed these things.are back in fashion.

240
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:15,120
 

241
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:19,490
- Grandmother's dress.- Oh, honey.

242
00:09:19,499 --> 00:09:19,590
 

243
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:22,060
He's a lovely man, Annie.

244
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:22,190
 

245
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:27,180
I know. He is wonderful, isn't he?.And he's such a wonderful athlete.

246
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:27,330
 

247
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:29,460
- Are his folks nice?.- You'll love them.

248
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:29,560
 

249
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,430
We're going down to D.C. Tonight.to be with them Christmas morning.

250
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:32,530
 

251
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:36,700
- How did it happen?.- Well, it's silly, really.

252
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:36,800
 

253
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,710
I'd seen him at the office.Obviously, I'd seen him.

254
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:39,810
 

255
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:41,710
He's the associate publisher.

256
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:41,810
 

257
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:45,640
One day we both ordered sandwiches.from the same place.

258
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:45,710
 

259
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:49,910
He got my lettuce and tomato on wheat,which, of course, he was allergic to.

260
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,020
 

261
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:52,250
And I got his lettuce.and tomato on white.

262
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:52,350
 

263
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,720
- How amazing.- It is, isn't it?

264
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:54,860
 

265
00:09:54,869 --> 00:09:56,950
You make a million decisions.that mean nothing.

266
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:57,090
 

267
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:59,750
Then one day you order takeout,and it changes your life.

268
00:09:59,759 --> 00:09:59,860
 

269
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:01,950
Destiny takes a hand.

270
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:02,060
 

271
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,660
Mom, destiny is.something we've invented...

272
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:04,770
 

273
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:08,530
because we can't stand the fact that.everything that happens is accidental.

274
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:08,640
 

275
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:13,900
How do you explain that you both ordered.the same sandwich except for the bread?

276
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:14,010
 

277
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:17,380
How many people in this world.like lettuce and tomato...

278
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:17,450
 

279
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,350
without something else like tuna?

280
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:20,450
 

281
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:25,150
Well, it wasn't a sign.It was a coincidence.

282
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:25,250
 

283
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:29,310
I was in Atlantic City with my family.Cliff was a waiter.

284
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:29,460
 

285
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:34,160
He wasn't even supposed to work.that night, and suppose he hadn't?

286
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:34,260
 

287
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:37,990
He asked me to take a midnight walk.on the Steel Pier.

288
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:38,100
 

289
00:10:38,109 --> 00:10:42,560
I've probably told you this.a million times, but I don't care.

290
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:42,670
 

291
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:45,070
Then he held my hand.

292
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:45,170
 

293
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:47,440
At one point I looked down.and I couldn't tell...

294
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:47,540
 

295
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:50,770
which fingers were his.and which were mine.

296
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:50,850
 

297
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,640
And I knew.

298
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:53,750
 

299
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,180
- What?.- You know.

300
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:57,280
 

301
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,620
- What?.- Magic.

302
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:00,760
 

303
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:03,350
It was magic.

304
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:03,490
 

305
00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:04,960
Magic?

306
00:11:04,969 --> 00:11:05,090
 

307
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:09,260
I knew we'd be together forever and.that everything would be wonderful...

308
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,360
 

309
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:12,090
just the way you feel about Walter.

310
00:11:12,099 --> 00:11:12,200
 

311
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:17,230
Walter? It's quite.a formal name, isn't it?

312
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:17,340
 

313
00:11:17,349 --> 00:11:20,800
One of the things I truly knew.was that your father and I...

314
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:20,910
 

315
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:23,600
were going to have.a wonderful time in...

316
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:23,710
 

317
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:27,010
- The sack, I believe you call it.- Mom!

318
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:27,080
 

319
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:29,350
Of course, it took.several years before everything...

320
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:29,450
 

321
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,350
worked like clockwork.in that department.

322
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:31,450
 

323
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:33,440
So don't be worried.if it takes a while.

324
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:33,590
 

325
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:36,990
- Well, we already...- Fine. Fine. Fiddle-de-dee.

326
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:37,120
 

327
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,120
- How's it working?.- Like clockwork.

328
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:41,460
 

329
00:11:41,469 --> 00:11:43,450
Oh, honey.

330
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:46,070
 

331
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,230
- It's a sign.- You don't believe in signs.

332
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:55,910
 

333
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,510
They loved you! I told you they.would love you, and they loved you!

334
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:00,580
 

335
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:03,280
- I love you.- I love you, Walter.

336
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,850
 

337
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,820
Did anyone ever call you.anything other than Walter?

338
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:08,960
 

339
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:11,250
Nope.

340
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:11,360
 

341
00:12:11,369 --> 00:12:13,290
Not even when you were young?

342
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:13,430
 

343
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,660
Nope, not even when I was young.

344
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,430
 

345
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:19,490
You sure you don't.want to drive with me?

346
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:19,600
 

347
00:12:19,609 --> 00:12:22,430
How will I get back.to Baltimore on Friday?

348
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:22,540
 

349
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:26,940
I forgot the present. I left your.stepmother's present inside by accident.

350
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:27,040
 

351
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:30,240
When we're old and gray, you're gonna.have to remind me to put my teeth in.

352
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:30,340
 

353
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:34,970
I'II be walking all over town, smacking.my gums together and not even noticing.

354
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:35,050
 

355

00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:11,990
 

529
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:14,550
But we're dealing with it.

530
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:14,700
 

531
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:19,660
And Jonah and I will.get along just fine again...

532
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:19,770
 

533
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:22,790
as soon as I break his radio.

534
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,300
 

535
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:27,300
I have no doubt that.you're a wonderful father.

536
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:27,410
 

537
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:31,140
- You can tell a lot from a voice.- You certainly can.

538
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:31,210
 

539
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:35,840
But something must be missing if.Jonah still feels you're under a cloud.

540
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:35,950
 

541
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:39,250
Just a few questions.Are you sleeping at night?

542
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:39,350
 

543
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,410
- He doesn't sleep at all.- How do you know that?

544
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:42,560
 

545
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:44,250
I live here.

546
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:47,930
 

547
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:51,330
Look, it's Christmas.

548
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:54,700
 

549
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:58,760
Maggie, my wife...

550
00:17:58,769 --> 00:17:58,870
 

551
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:01,340
She really did it.

552
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:01,440
 

553
00:18:01,449 --> 00:18:03,340
I mean, she loved...

554
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,850
 

555
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:06,840
She made everything beautiful.

556
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:09,180
 

557
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:12,810
And it's just tough.this time of year.

558
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:12,920
 

559
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:14,580
Any kid needs a mother.

560
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:14,720
 

561
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:19,490
Could it be that you need someone.just as much as Jonah does?

562
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:22,400
 

563
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:23,760
Yes.

564
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:23,860
 

565
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:27,200
Don't answer that. Let's get into that.right after these messages.

566
00:18:27,209 --> 00:18:27,300
 

567
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:29,530
Sam, Jonah, don't go away.

568
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:29,640
 

569
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:33,900
If you've just tuned in,we're talking to Sleepless in Seattle.

570
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:34,010
 

571
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:38,070
We'll be right back after this break.with your listener response.

572
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:38,150
 

573
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,940
What's she talking about?

574
00:18:39,949 --> 00:18:40,050
 

575
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:43,110
This is when other people get to call in.and dump on what you said.

576
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:43,220
 

577
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:48,710
Oh, oh. This is really fun,and helpful.

578
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:54,760
 

579
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:56,960
I'll bet he's tall.with a cute butt.

580
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:57,060
 

581
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,400
Bet he hasn't bathed in weeks.and he stinks.

582
00:18:59,409 --> 00:18:59,500
 

583
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:01,830
Harriet, shut up.Hi. Can I help you?

584
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:01,940
 

585
00:19:01,949 --> 00:19:03,660
Tea with the bag out.

586
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:03,770
 

587
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:07,710
Maybe I'll hustle myself out to Seattle.Give him a gift for New Year's Eve.

588
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:07,810
 

589
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:11,110
You go on out there if you want to,but don't open his refrigerator.

590
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:11,180
 

591
00:19:11,189 --> 00:19:14,050
They don't cover anything.when they put it in the fridge.

592
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:14,150
 

593
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:16,640
They just stick it in there and.leave it till it walks out by itself.

594
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:16,750
 

595
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:20,240
What I'm saying is, I wouldn't kick this.guy out of my bed for eating crackers.

596
00:19:20,249 --> 00:19:20,390
 

597
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:22,290
You know what I'm saying?.Sixty-five cents.

598
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:22,390
 

599
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:25,980
Let's take a call.before we get back to Sleepless.

600
00:19:25,989 --> 00:19:26,130
 

601
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:29,220
Knoxville, Tennessee,you're on the air. Talk to me.

602
00:19:29,229 --> 00:19:29,330
 

603
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:34,030
Yes, I would just like to know.where I could get this man's address.

604
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:34,130
 

605
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:36,300
- Honey, get in line.- We don't give that information.

606
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:36,400
 

607
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,030
Next caller, go ahead.

608
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,570
 

609
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:42,630
If there was one question.I was allowed to ask...

610
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:42,740
 

611
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:44,940
Oh, go ahead.

612
00:19:44,949 --> 00:19:45,010
 

613
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:49,070
People who truly loved once.are far more likely to love again.

614
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:49,180
 

615
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:53,550
Do you think there's someone out there.you could love as much as your wife?

616
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,360
 

617
00:19:56,369 --> 00:20:00,520
Well, Dr. Marcia Fieldstone,that's hard to imagine.

618
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:00,630
 

619
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,960
What are you going to do?

620
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:04,060
 

621
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:09,060
Well, I'm going to get.out of bed every morning...

622
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:09,170
 

623
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,400
breathe in and out all day long.

624
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:11,510
 

625
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,340
Then after a while.I won't have to remind myself...

626
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:16,440
 

627
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:20,570
to get out of bed in the morning.and breathe in and out.

628
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:21,880
 

629
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:26,480
And then after a while.I won't have to think about how...

630
00:20:26,489 --> 00:20:26,590
 

631
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:29,720
I had it great and perfect.for a while.

632
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:29,860
 

633
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:34,590
Sam, tell me what was.so special about your wife?

634
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:34,700
 

635
00:20:34,709 --> 00:20:37,260
Well, how long is your program?

636
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,230
 

637
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:42,830
Oh, well, it was a...

638
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:42,940
 

639
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:44,840
It was a million.tiny little things.

640
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:44,940
 

641
00:20:44,949 --> 00:20:49,970
When you added them all up, it just.meant we were supposed to be together.

642
00:20:49,979 --> 00:20:50,040
 

643
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:54,140
And I knew it. I knew it.the very first time I touched her.

644
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:54,250
 

645
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:57,180
It was like coming home...

646
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:57,280
 

647
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,410
only to no home I'd ever known.

648
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:00,550
 

649
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,520
I was just taking her hand...

650
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:03,660
 

651
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:06,960
to help her out of a car...

652
00:21:06,969 --> 00:21:07,060
 

653
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:08,530
and I knew it.

654
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:09,860
 

655
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:12,230
It was like...

656
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:12,330
 

657
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:14,890
- Magic.- Magic.

658
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:15,000
 

659
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:18,600
Well, folks,it's time to wrap it up.

660
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:18,710
 

661
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:21,300
I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone.in Chicago.

662
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:21,410
 

663
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:25,870
And to all my listeners,a magical and merry Christmas.

664
00:21:25,879 --> 00:21:25,950
 

665
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:30,850
And to you, Sleepless in Seattle,we hope you'll call again soon.

666
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:30,950
 

667
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:34,150
- Let us know how it's going.- Oh, you can count on it.

668
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:34,290
 

669
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:39,820
When you find me

670
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:39,960
 

671
00:21:39,969 --> 00:21:44,520
I know somewhere

672
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:44,630
 

673
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:50,070
Over the rainbow

674
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,810
 

675
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:56,710
The bluebirds glide

676
00:21:56,719 --> 00:22:00,710
 

677
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:04,580
Birds fly

678
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:04,690
 

679
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:08,990
Over the rainbow

680
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:09,120
 

681
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:14,360
Why, then, oh, why

682
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:14,460
 

683
00:22:14,469 --> 00:22:18,760
Can't I

684
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:24,070
 

685
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,040
This man sells the greatest soup.you've ever eaten...

686
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:27,140
 

687
00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:29,270
and he is the meanest man.in America.

688
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:29,380
 

689
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:32,970
I feel very strongly about this, Becky.It's not just about the soup.

690
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:33,050
 

691
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,140
- Do it. What else?.- New Year's Eve.

692
00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:35,250
 

693
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:37,680
- Please don't make me write it.- Listen to this.

694
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:37,780
 

695
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:40,880
"Phone service in the greater Chicago.area was tied up for two hours...

696
00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:41,020
 

697
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:43,460
Christmas Eve when some kid.calls a phone-in radio show...

698
00:22:43,469 --> 00:22:43,590
 

699
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,490
and says that his dad.needs a new wife.

700
00:22:45,499 --> 00:22:45,590
 

701
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:50,000
Two thousand women called the station.asking for the guy's number."

702
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:50,100
 

703
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:53,330
I heard it. This kid calls up.and says, ''My dad needs a wife."

704
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:53,430
 

705
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:56,990
This shrink forces the guy to the phone.and says, "You want to talk about it?"

706
00:22:56,999 --> 00:22:57,100
 

707
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,600
He says, "No,as a matter of fact, I don't."

708
00:22:59,609 --> 00:22:59,710
 

709
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:02,730
Suddenly, for no reason at all, he talks.about how much he loved his wife...

710
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:02,840
 

711
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,810
and how he just.fell in love with her...

712
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:04,880
 

713
00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:06,810
like he was one.of those cows in Michigan.

714
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:06,910
 

715
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:09,970
- What cows in Michigan?.- It was on 60 Minutes.

716
00:23:09,979 --> 00:23:10,080
 

717
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:12,210
There were those cows.that got zapped by stray voltage.

718
00:23:12,219 --> 00:23:12,320
 

719
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:14,950
No one knows why.Maybe it was Wisconsin.

720
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:15,090
 

721
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:19,350
But anyway, I was listening to him.talk about how much he loved his wife...

722
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:19,460
 

723
00:23:19,469 --> 00:23:21,860
and suddenly I was crying.

724
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:21,960
 

725
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:24,190
It's like what happens when.I watch those phone company ads.

726
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:24,300
 

727
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:26,290
I don't have to see the whole thing,just the part where...

728
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:26,400
 

729
00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:29,340
the daughter gives the mother the.refrigerator with the big red bow on it.

730
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:29,440
 

731
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:33,530
The Polaroid commercial. Two 5-year-olds.at their grandfather's birthday party.

732
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:33,640
 

733
00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:35,540
- They're making the album.- With the glue.

734
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:35,640
 

735
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:38,300
That kills me.

736
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:38,380
 

737
00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:40,780
You should write.something about this.

738
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:40,880
 

739
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:43,370
- About what?.- Whatever it is.

740
00:23:43,379 --> 00:23:43,480
 

741
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:47,210
I'll tell you. Two thousand women.calling a radio station for a husband.

742
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:47,350
 

743
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,250
There are a lot of desperate women.out there lookin' for love.

744
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:49,360
 

745
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:51,260
Especially over a certain age.

746
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:51,360
 

747
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:54,560
It's easier to be killed by a terrorist.than get married over the age of 40.

748
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:54,660
 

749
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:56,560
That is not true.That statistic is not true.

750
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:56,660
 

751
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,790
That's right. It's not true.But it feels true.

752
00:23:58,799 --> 00:23:58,900
 

753
00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:00,800
It feels true.because it is true.

754
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:00,900
 

755
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:03,530
There's practically a whole book.about how that's not true.

756
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:03,640
 

757
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:06,630
- Calm down. You brought it up.- I did not, Wyatt.

758
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:06,740
 

759
00:24:06,749 --> 00:24:09,900
- Did you even read that book?.- Did anyone read it all the way through?

760
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:09,980
 

761
00:24:09,989 --> 00:24:13,040
Are you two finished?.Fine. Now where were we?

762
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:13,150
 

763
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:17,280
If someone is a widower,why do they say that he was widowed?

764
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:17,380
 

765
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:20,110
Why don't they say.he was widowered?

766
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,820
 

767
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:24,760
I was just wondering.

768
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:24,860
 

769
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:26,790
What was that about up there?

770
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:26,930
 

771
00:24:26,939 --> 00:24:29,790
- What was what?.- What's with you?

772
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:29,900
 

773
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:33,660
- Nothing's with me.- Something's with you.

774
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:33,770
 

775
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:37,230
- What are you saying?.- Whatever it is, you can tell me.

776
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:37,340
 

777
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:38,800
Sleepless in Seattle?

778
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:38,910
 

779
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:41,530
That's what she called him on the show.because he can't sleep.

780
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:41,640
 

781
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:44,700
And now 2,000 women.want his number.

782
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:44,780
 

783
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:47,180
The guy could be a crackhead,a transvestite...

784
00:24:47,189 --> 00:24:47,280
 

785
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:50,510
a flasher, a junkie,a chain-saw murderer...

786
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:50,620
 

787
00:24:50,629 --> 00:24:53,710
or someone really sick,someone like my Rick.

788
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:55,620
 

789
00:24:55,629 --> 00:24:58,520
- Actually, he sounded nice.- Oh?

790
00:24:58,529 --> 00:24:59,730
 

791
00:24:59,739 --> 00:25:03,960
Oh, really?.Now we're getting down to it.

792
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:04,060
 

793
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,970
Please. Becky,I'm madly in love with Walter.

794
00:25:06,979 --> 00:25:07,070
 

795
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:10,230
He did the craziest thing.the other night. What was that?

796
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:11,940
 

797
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:16,240
Oh, it was so funny.We were hysterical. What was that?

798
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:27,690
 

799
00:25:27,699 --> 00:25:33,090
You know, I've got to go to Boston.for the convention, right?

800
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:33,190
 

801
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:36,390
Then I got to visit Winston-Hughes.about switching over our computers.

802
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:36,500
 

803
00:25:36,509 --> 00:25:41,930
But why don't we meet in New York.for Valentine's Day weekend?

804
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:42,040
 

805
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:45,130
Walter, I'd love to!

806
00:25:45,139 --> 00:25:45,240
 

807
00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:47,900
We can stay at the Plaza.

808
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:48,010
 

809
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:50,370
Ice-stake in Central Park.

810
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:50,480
 

811
00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:52,710
Register.

812
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:52,780
 

813
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:54,470
Register?

814
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:54,580
 

815
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:59,180
You know, for dishes,glasses, silver, everything.

816
00:25:59,189 --> 00:26:01,790
 

817
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,190
How about it?

818
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:06,460
 

819
00:26:06,469 --> 00:26:09,330
I'II take you to Chinatown.for dim sum.

820
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:09,430
 

821
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:12,360
- Does it have wheat in it?.- I don't think so.

822
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:15,840
 

823
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:18,860
Dim sum, dim sum

824
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,210
 

825
00:26:21,219 --> 00:26:25,700
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

826
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:25,780
 

827
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:30,080
five, four, three, two, one!

828
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:30,180
 

829
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:34,780
Hey, Jonah. Wake up. Wake up, man.The ball's droppin'.

830
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:34,920
 

831
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:36,410
Happy new year!

832
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:43,700
 

833
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:46,290
Okay, pal. I got ya.

834
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:46,400
 

835
00:26:46,409 --> 00:26:47,630
It's okay.

836
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:47,730
 

837
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,730
There we go.

838
00:26:49,739 --> 00:27:22,900
 

839
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:25,460
Happy new year.

840
00:27:25,469 --> 00:27:25,570
 

841
00:27:25,579 --> 00:27:27,540
Happy new year.

842
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:30,710
 

843
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:33,010
Kiss Howard.

844
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:33,110
 

845
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:35,170
Good night, Howard.

846
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:49,460
 

847
00:27:49,469 --> 00:27:54,730
Sometimes I wonder

848
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:54,830
 

849
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,960
Why I spend

850
00:27:57,969 --> 00:27:58,070
 

851
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:02,370
The lonely night

852
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:02,480
 

853
00:28:02,489 --> 00:28:05,930
Dreaming of a song

854
00:28:05,939 --> 00:28:06,010
 

855
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:08,570
The melody

856
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:08,680
 

857
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:12,240
Haunts my reverie

858
00:28:12,249 --> 00:28:12,350
 

859
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:17,550
And I am once again with you

860
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:17,690
 

861
00:28:17,699 --> 00:28:21,180
When our love was new

862
00:28:21,189 --> 00:28:23,060
 

863
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:27,000
And each kiss an inspiration

864
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:30,500
 

865
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:34,170
But that was long ago

866
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:34,270
 

867
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:38,180
Now my consolation

868
00:28:38,189 --> 00:28:38,240
 

869
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:43,110
Is in the stardust of a song

870
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:43,220
 

871
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:48,780
Beside the garden wall

872
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:48,920
 

873
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:53,220
When stars are bright

874
00:28:53,229 --> 00:28:53,330
 

875
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:56,780
You are in my arms

876
00:28:56,789 --> 00:28:56,930
 

877
00:28:56,939 --> 00:28:59,800
The nightingale

878
00:28:59,809 --> 00:28:59,900
 

879
00:28:59,909 --> 00:29:03,230
Tells his fairy tale

880
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:03,340
 

881
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:07,300
Of paradise where roses bloom

882
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:07,410
 

883
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:09,470
Can I have half your beer?

884
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:10,540
 

885
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,700
Sure. Go ahead.

886
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,980
 

887
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:17,970
What did I used to say?

888
00:29:17,979 --> 00:29:18,080
 

889
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,210
''Here's looking at you"?

890
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:20,320
 

891
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:22,250
''Here's mud in your eye"?

892
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:22,360
 

893
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:24,650
"Here's to us."

894
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:25,860
 

895
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:29,060
You used to say, "Here's to us."

896
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:32,630
 

897
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:36,900
Oh, babe.I miss you so much it hurts.

898
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:54,420
 

899
00:29:54,429 --> 00:29:56,390
- What do you want to do?.- We'll tell him when he gets here.

900
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:56,520
 

901
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:58,750
You want to tell him.I don't mind telling him.

902
00:29:58,759 --> 00:29:58,860
 

903
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:01,550
- She's here.- She's back. She has another idea.

904
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:01,660
 

905
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:03,600
I don't need...Claire, how are you?

906
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:03,700
 

907
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:06,290
I'm so glad you're here.I heard you on the radio.

908
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:06,400
 

909
00:30:06,409 --> 00:30:09,890
- I told everyone about it.- We already knew.

910
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:10,000
 

911
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,230
- How did you...- Grace.

912
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:11,340
 

913
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:13,460
The dispatcher?.All of Seattle knows.

914
00:30:13,469 --> 00:30:13,570
 

915
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:15,970
I was brushing my teeth.and suddenly there you were.

916
00:30:15,979 --> 00:30:16,080
 

917
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:19,140
I couldn't believe my ears.I called my mother in Las Vegas.

918
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:19,210
 

919
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:24,010
I said, "Mother, turn on the radio.That's my architect."

920
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:24,120
 

921
00:30:24,129 --> 00:30:26,920
It is so nice...

922
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:27,020
 

923
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:30,420
when a man.can express his feelings.

924
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:30,520
 

925
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:33,390
- It's wonderful.- I wish I could express my feelings.

926
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:33,490
 

927
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:38,690
- So, Claire, is there a problem?.- I was tossing and turning last night.

928
00:30:38,699 --> 00:30:38,800
 

929
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:44,070
I realized I'm never going to fit my.platters in the refrigerator we ordered.

930
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:44,170
 

931
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:46,540
When I give parties,I always put in platters.

932
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:46,640
 

933
00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:49,970
So I thought I would get the Sub-Zero.refrigerator instead. The only problem...

934
00:30:49,979 --> 00:30:50,040
 

935
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:51,940
We have to redo all the cabinets.

936
00:30:51,949 --> 00:30:52,050
 

937
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:55,410
- We'll be into this wall.- That's a bearing wall.

938
00:30:55,419 --> 00:30:55,520
 

939
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:57,810
That's a delay, Claire, of...

940
00:30:57,819 --> 00:30:57,920
 

941
00:30:57,929 --> 00:30:59,820
- Two, three...- Five, six...

942
00:30:59,829 --> 00:30:59,920
 

943
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:01,890
- Twelve weeks.- I don't mind.

944
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:01,990
 

945
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:04,420
The important thing.is to get it right.

946
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:04,560
 

947
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:06,490
- Absolutely.- Your words.

948
00:31:06,499 --> 00:31:06,590
 

949
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:09,290
I've got to rush.La d?/i>corateur calls.

950
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:09,400
 

951
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,560
- Bye!.- Bye-bye.

952
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:15,130
 

953
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,430
Well, this is fate.She's divorced.

954
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:17,540
 

955
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:19,660
We don't want to redo the cabinets,and you need a wife.

956
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:19,770
 

957
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:22,400
What do they call that.when everything intersects?

958
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:22,510
 

959
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:24,440
The Bermuda Triangle.

960
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:34,150
 

961
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,680
And here's another one.You got room for one more here?

962
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:37,820
 

963
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,760
There you go.You all right there?

964
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:39,890
 

965
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:43,800
- Look at this, Dad. They're all for you.- Yes, sir. There you go.

966
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:47,270
 

967
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,900
"Sleepless in Seattle.In care of Dr. Marcia Fieldstone"?

968
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:50,000
 

969
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:54,700
If you have trouble sleeping, drink.a glass of water from the other side.

970
00:31:54,709 --> 00:31:54,810
 

971
00:31:54,819 --> 00:31:57,280
- I thought that was for hiccups.- Does it work for hiccups?

972
00:31:57,289 --> 00:31:57,340
 

973
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:01,010
For hiccups, take a spoonful of sugar.and hold it in your mouth for a minute.

974
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:01,110
 

975
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,950
- Really?.- Thank you.

976
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:05,050
 

977
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:07,320
What possessed you.to give them our address?

978
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:07,450
 

979
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:10,480
They called and asked for it.

980
00:32:10,489 --> 00:32:10,620
 

981
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:12,720
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle...

982
00:32:12,729 --> 00:32:12,860
 

983
00:32:12,869 --> 00:32:16,630
You're the most attractive man.I ever laid ears on."

984
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:16,730
 

985
00:32:16,739 --> 00:32:20,360
Wait, wait, wait. They called?.How did they get our number?

986
00:32:20,369 --> 00:32:20,470
 

987
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:22,530
Let me guess.You gave it to them.

988
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:22,640
 

989
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,660
You have to give them your phone number,or they won't let you on the air.

990
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:25,770
 

991
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:28,640
''Dear Sleepless in Seattle,I live in Tulsa."

992
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:28,740
 

993
00:32:28,749 --> 00:32:32,180
- Where's that?.- It's in Oklahoma.

994
00:32:32,189 --> 00:32:32,250
 

995
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:34,940
- Do you know where Oklahoma is?.- Somewhere in the middle.

996
00:32:34,949 --> 00:32:35,050
 

997
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:38,250
I'm not even gonna think about.what they're not teaching you in school.

998
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:38,350
 

999
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:40,790
Yeah, it's somewhere.in the middle.

1000
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:40,890
 

1001
00:32:40,899 --> 00:32:45,980
Generally speaking, we should rule out.anyone that doesn't live near here.

1002
00:32:45,989 --> 00:32:46,130
 

1003
00:32:46,139 --> 00:32:47,890
She's willing to fly anywhere.

1004
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,300
 

1005
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:53,200
She looks like my third grade teacher.I hated my third grade teacher.

1006
00:32:53,209 --> 00:32:53,300
 

1007
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:57,330
Wait a minute.She is my third grade teacher!

1008
00:32:57,339 --> 00:32:57,440
 

1009
00:32:57,449 --> 00:33:02,170
- Aren't you gonna read any of these?.- This is not how it's done.

1010
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:02,280
 

1011
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:05,570
I'd much rather.just see somebody I like...

1012
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:05,650
 

1013
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:08,940
and get a feeling about them...

1014
00:33:08,949 --> 00:33:09,050
 

1015
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:11,180
and ask them.if they want to have a drink.

1016
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:11,280
 

1017
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,180
- Or a slice of pizza?.- Not dinner.

1018
00:33:13,189 --> 00:33:13,290
 

1019
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:15,380
Not necessarily on the first date.

1020
00:33:15,389 --> 00:33:15,520
 

1021
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:17,920
Halfway through dinner you could be.really sorry you asked them to dinner.

1022
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:18,020
 

1023
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,960
Whereas, if it's just a drink...

1024
00:33:19,969 --> 00:33:20,090
 

1025
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:22,560
if you like them,you could always ask them to dinner.

1026
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:22,700
 

1027
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,220
But if not, you can just say,"Well, that was great."

1028
00:33:25,229 --> 00:33:25,330
 

1029
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:29,790
And then you go home.See what I mean?

1030
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:29,900
 

1031
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:32,060
I wonder if.it still works this way.

1032
00:33:32,069 --> 00:33:32,170
 

1033
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:36,440
- It doesn't. They ask you.- I'm starting to notice that.

1034
00:33:36,449 --> 00:33:36,540
 

1035
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:41,100
If you get a new wife, I guess.you'II have sex with her, huh?

1036
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:41,180
 

1037
00:33:41,189 --> 00:33:43,650
I certainly hope so.

1038
00:33:43,659 --> 00:33:43,750
 

1039
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:48,150
- Will she scratch up your back?.- What?

1040
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:48,290
 

1041
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:53,020
In movies, women are always scratching.up the man's back and screaming.

1042
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:53,130
 

1043
00:33:53,139 --> 00:33:55,990
- How do you know this?.- Jed's got cable.

1044
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:56,100
 

1045
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:58,260
Oh, Jed's got cable.

1046
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,130
 

1047
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:02,830
Hand me that towel.behind you, please.

1048
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:07,510
 

1049
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,480
- Thank you.- I need it too.

1050
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:09,580
 

1051
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:13,270
Here. Let me get you.Jed's got cable.

1052
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:13,350
 

1053
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,910
Another bride

1054
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:16,020
 

1055
00:34:16,029 --> 00:34:18,610
Another groom

1056
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:18,720
 

1057
00:34:18,729 --> 00:34:24,120
Another sunny honeymoon

1058
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:24,220
 

1059
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,950
Another season

1060
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:27,060
 

1061
00:34:27,069 --> 00:34:31,660
And that's the reason.for makin' whoopee

1062
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:46,750
 

1063
00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:51,650
When the sun is high.in the afternoon sky

1064
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:51,750
 

1065
00:34:51,759 --> 00:34:56,090
You can always.find something to do

1066
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:56,220
 

1067
00:34:56,229 --> 00:35:02,090
But from dusk till dawn.as the clock ticks on

1068
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:02,200
 

1069
00:35:02,209 --> 00:35:08,930
Something happens to you

1070
00:35:08,939 --> 00:35:09,040
 

1071
00:35:09,049 --> 00:35:13,530
In the wee small hours

1072
00:35:13,539 --> 00:35:13,640
 

1073
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:17,230
Of the morning

1074
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:17,310
 

1075
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:20,940
While the whole wide world

1076
00:35:20,949 --> 00:35:21,050
 

1077
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:25,110
Is fast asleep

1078
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:25,220
 

1079
00:35:25,229 --> 00:35:29,020
You lie awake

1080
00:35:29,029 --> 00:35:29,160
 

1081
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:33,110
And think about the boy

1082
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:33,260
 

1083
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:36,060
And never ever think

1084
00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:36,160
 

1085
00:35:36,169 --> 00:35:41,330
Of counting sheep

1086
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:41,430
 

1087
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,930
Welcome back to.the "Best of Dr. Marcia Fieldstone"...

1088
00:35:43,939 --> 00:35:44,040
 

1089
00:35:44,049 --> 00:35:46,770
clinical psychologist.and the friend you never had.

1090
00:35:46,779 --> 00:35:46,870
 

1091
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:50,870
- Remember Marooned in Miami?.- He says he doesn't love me anymore.

1092
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:50,940
 

1093
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:53,840
Why would you want to be.with someone who doesn't love you?

1094
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:53,950
 

1095
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:55,910
Disappointed in Denver.

1096
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:56,020
 

1097
00:35:56,029 --> 00:36:00,080
Every time I come close to orgasm,he goes to make himself a sandwich.

1098
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:00,190
 

1099
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,280
Why don't you make him.a sandwich beforehand?

1100
00:36:02,289 --> 00:36:02,420
 

1101
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:04,320
Sleepless in Seattle.

1102
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:04,420
 

1103
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:09,760
Well, I'm going to get.out of bed every morning....

1104
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:09,860
 

1105
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:13,630
and breathe in and out all day long.

1106
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:13,730
 

1107
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:18,070
Then after a while.I won't have to remind myself....

1108
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:18,170
 

1109
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:22,900
to get out of bed in the morning.and breathe in and out.

1110
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:24,940
 

1111
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:29,850
And then after a while.I won't have to think about how...

1112
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:29,950
 

1113
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:33,890
I had it great and perfect.for a while.

1114
00:36:33,899 --> 00:36:33,990
 

1115
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:38,650
Sam, tell me what was.so special about your wife?

1116
00:36:38,659 --> 00:36:38,790
 

1117
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:41,730
Well, how long is your program?

1118
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:43,400
 

1119
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:47,060
Oh, well, it was a...

1120
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:47,170
 

1121
00:36:47,179 --> 00:36:49,100
It was a million.tiny little things.

1122
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:49,200
 

1123
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:54,140
When you added them all up, it just.meant we were supposed to be together.

1124
00:36:54,149 --> 00:36:54,240
 

1125
00:36:54,249 --> 00:36:58,870
And I knew it. I knew it.the very first time I touched her.

1126
00:36:58,879 --> 00:36:58,950
 

1127
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:01,280
It was like coming home...

1128
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:01,380
 

1129
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:04,540
only to no home I'd ever known.

1130
00:37:04,549 --> 00:37:04,650
 

1131
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:07,640
I was just taking her hand...

1132
00:37:07,649 --> 00:37:07,790
 

1133
00:37:07,799 --> 00:37:10,420
to help her out of a car...

1134
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:11,560
 

1135
00:37:11,569 --> 00:37:13,750
and I knew it.

1136
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:13,860
 

1137
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:16,520
It was like....

1138
00:37:16,529 --> 00:37:16,630
 

1139
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:18,530
magic.

1140
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:40,020
 

1141
00:37:40,029 --> 00:37:43,920
I think I'm going crazy, Dennis.Are you happily married?

1142
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:44,020
 

1143
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:46,960
- What?.- I mean, why did you get married?

1144
00:37:46,969 --> 00:37:47,060
 

1145
00:37:47,069 --> 00:37:49,390
Was it all trumpets.and fireworks?

1146
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:49,500
 

1147
00:37:49,509 --> 00:37:52,620
I got married because Betsy said.we had to break up or get married...

1148
00:37:52,629 --> 00:37:52,730
 

1149
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:54,390
so we got married.

1150
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:55,300
 

1151
00:37:55,309 --> 00:37:56,890
But when you first met her...

1152
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:57,000
 

1153
00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:59,490
did you believe.she was the only person for you?

1154
00:37:59,499 --> 00:37:59,610
 

1155
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:02,730
That in some mystical,cosmic way it was fated?

1156
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:02,840
 

1157
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:06,680
Annie, when you're.attracted to someone...

1158
00:38:06,689 --> 00:38:06,750
 

1159
00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:09,610
it just means that your subconscious.is attracted to their subconscious...

1160
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:09,720
 

1161
00:38:09,729 --> 00:38:11,550
subconsciously.

1162
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:11,650
 

1163
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:15,350
What we think of as fate is two neuroses.knowing they're a perfect match.

1164
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,790
 

1165
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:18,720
I don't even know him.

1166
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:18,820
 

1167
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:23,630
I am having all of these fantasies.about some man I have never even met...

1168
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:23,730
 

1169
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:25,720
who lives in Seattle!

1170
00:38:25,729 --> 00:38:25,830
 

1171
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,890
It rains nine months.of the year in Seattle.

1172
00:38:27,899 --> 00:38:28,000
 

1173
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:32,940
I know! I know!.I do not want to move to Seattle.

1174
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:35,810
 

1175
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:39,300
But what I really don't want.to do is end up always wondering...

1176
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:39,380
 

1177
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:42,640
what might have happened.and knowing I could have done something.

1178
00:38:42,649 --> 00:38:42,750
 

1179
00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:44,940
What do you think?

1180
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:45,050
 

1181
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:46,950
It's just cold feet, isn't it?

1182
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:47,050
 

1183
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:50,080
Everybody panics before.they get married. Didn't you?

1184
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:51,020
 

1185
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:52,850
- I did.- You did.

1186
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:52,960
 

1187
00:38:52,969 --> 00:38:56,290
Thank you very much, Dennis. I feel so.much better just having blown this off.

1188
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:56,400
 

1189
00:38:56,409 --> 00:38:57,690
Anytime.

1190
00:38:57,699 --> 00:38:57,800
 

1191
00:38:57,809 --> 00:39:01,630
Sandy has a girlfriend, Glenda.She's a weight lifter.

1192
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:01,730
 

1193
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,730
It's not like her neck.is bigger than her head.

1194
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:03,840
 

1195
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:07,830
I'm not asking you to set me up.I don't need your help with that.

1196
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:07,940
 

1197
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:11,000
I just want to know.what it's like out there.

1198
00:39:11,009 --> 00:39:11,080
 

1199
00:39:11,089 --> 00:39:13,570
That's what I'm trying to tell you,what women are lookin' for.

1200
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:13,680
 

1201
00:39:13,689 --> 00:39:16,150
Pecs and a cute butt.

1202
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:16,250
 

1203
00:39:16,259 --> 00:39:18,840
- Like, "He has the cutest butt''?.- Yeah.

1204
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:18,950
 

1205
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:21,780
- Where did I hear that recently?.- Everywhere.

1206
00:39:21,789 --> 00:39:21,920
 

1207
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:24,520
You can't even turn on the news.nowadays without hearing about...

1208
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:24,660
 

1209
00:39:24,669 --> 00:39:27,520
how some babe thought.some guy's butt was cute.

1210
00:39:27,529 --> 00:39:27,630
 

1211
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:31,030
Who the first woman to say this was,I don't know. But it caught on.

1212
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:31,160
 

1213
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:33,290
So how's my butt?

1214
00:39:33,299 --> 00:39:36,070
 

1215
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,870
- Not bad.- Really?

1216
00:39:37,879 --> 00:39:37,970
 

1217
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:39,940
- Is it cute though?.- I don't know.

1218
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:40,040
 

1219
00:39:40,049 --> 00:39:42,010
Are we grading on a curve?

1220
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:42,110
 

1221
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:44,600
When's the last time.you were out there?

1222
00:39:44,609 --> 00:39:48,810
 

1223
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:50,750
Jimmy Carter, 1978.

1224
00:39:50,759 --> 00:39:52,820
 

1225
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:55,120
Things are.a little different now.

1226
00:39:55,129 --> 00:39:55,250
 

1227
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:58,620
First you have to be friends.You have to like each other.

1228
00:39:58,629 --> 00:39:58,720
 

1229
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:02,560
Then you neck.This could go on for years.

1230
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:02,660
 

1231
00:40:02,669 --> 00:40:05,220
Then you have tests.Then you get to do it with a condom.

1232
00:40:05,229 --> 00:40:05,330
 

1233
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:07,460
The good news is,you split the check.

1234
00:40:07,469 --> 00:40:08,470
 

1235
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:11,030
I don't think I could.let a woman pay for dinner.

1236
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:11,140
 

1237
00:40:11,149 --> 00:40:13,500
Great. They'll throw.a parade in your honor.

1238
00:40:13,509 --> 00:40:13,610
 

1239
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:18,070
You'II be man of the year.in Seattle magazine.

1240
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:18,140
 

1241
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,980
Tiramisu.

1242
00:40:19,989 --> 00:40:20,080
 

1243
00:40:20,089 --> 00:40:22,950
- What is tiramisu?.- You'll find out.

1244
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:23,050
 

1245
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:24,680
- What is it?.- You'll see.

1246
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:24,780
 

1247
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:27,650
Some woman will want me to do it to her.I'm not going to know what it is.

1248
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:27,790
 

1249
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:29,150
You'II love it.

1250
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:30,190
 

1251
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:32,750
This is going to be tough.Tough, tough.

1252
00:40:32,759 --> 00:40:32,890
 

1253
00:40:32,899 --> 00:40:34,920
This is going to be much tougher.than I thought it was going to be.

1254
00:40:34,929 --> 00:40:35,060
 

1255
00:40:35,069 --> 00:40:38,390
How about that decorator.on the Bennett job?

1256
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:38,500
 

1257
00:40:38,509 --> 00:40:41,900
- Victoria?.- Yeah, she's perk.

1258
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:42,000
 

1259
00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:44,090
- No, I don't...- Come on!

1260
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:44,200
 

1261
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:45,830
I'm far away from that.

1262
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:45,940
 

1263
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:48,240
- I'm just assembling notes.- Notes.

1264
00:40:48,249 --> 00:40:48,340
 

1265
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:50,970
- How would I do that?.- What do you mean? Call her up.

1266
00:40:50,979 --> 00:40:51,040
 

1267
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:53,070
You say, "Let's get together.We'II look at swatches."

1268
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:53,180
 

1269
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:55,980
Call her on the phone?.Say, "Let's look at swatches"?

1270
00:40:55,989 --> 00:40:56,080
 

1271
00:40:56,089 --> 00:40:58,850
- Color schemes.- She's not gonna see through that?

1272
00:40:58,859 --> 00:40:58,950
 

1273
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:01,850
You don't do it like I do it.You do it in your own suave way.

1274
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:01,990
 

1275
00:41:01,999 --> 00:41:04,580
Think Cary Grant.

1276
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:04,720
 

1277
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:08,850
Cary Grant would say,"Come look at my swatches"?

1278
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:08,960
 

1279
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:12,260
Maybe he did. I know.he didn't do it in the movies.

1280
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:12,360
 

1281
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:13,890
Gunga Din?

1282
00:41:13,899 --> 00:41:14,000
 

1283
00:41:14,009 --> 00:41:16,260
Gunga Din is not.a swatch kind of movie.

1284
00:41:16,269 --> 00:41:16,370
 

1285
00:41:16,379 --> 00:41:18,800
Who knows what.he did in real life?

1286
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:18,900
 

1287
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,770
But he did that.with Dyan Cannon?

1288
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:21,870
 

1289
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:24,370
''Hello, Dyan.Take a look at these swatches."

1290
00:41:24,379 --> 00:41:43,130
 

1291
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:45,490
Jonah, I'm home.

1292
00:41:45,499 --> 00:41:48,500
 

1293
00:41:48,509 --> 00:41:49,900
Hey, Jonah!

1294
00:41:49,909 --> 00:42:08,920
 

1295
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:10,390
Hi, Dad. This is Jessica.

1296
00:42:10,399 --> 00:42:13,060
 

1297
00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:15,550
Well, it's nice.to meet you, Jessica.

1298
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:15,690
 

1299
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,720
Dad, this is amazing. If you play this.backwards, it says, ''Paul is dead.''

1300
00:42:19,729 --> 00:42:20,870
 

1301
00:42:20,879 --> 00:42:23,130
Yeah, I know.

1302
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:23,240
 

1303
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,960
How do you know?

1304
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:27,340
 

1305
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:29,830
Dad, could you shut the door?

1306
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:29,940
 

1307
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:32,100
Sure. Sure.

1308
00:42:32,109 --> 00:42:32,180
 

1309
00:42:32,189 --> 00:42:33,800
H and G.

1310
00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:35,410
 

1311
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:37,940
Hi and good-bye.

1312
00:42:37,949 --> 00:43:23,130
 

1313
00:43:23,139 --> 00:43:27,430
I'm back in the saddle again

1314
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:27,530
 

1315
00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:31,260
Out where a friend is a friend

1316
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:31,370
 

1317
00:43:31,379 --> 00:43:35,970
Where the longhorn cattle feed.on the lowly jimsonweed

1318
00:43:35,979 --> 00:43:36,080
 

1319
00:43:36,089 --> 00:43:40,070
Back in the saddle again

1320
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:40,150
 

1321
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,340
Ridin' the range once more

1322
00:43:44,349 --> 00:43:44,450
 

1323
00:43:44,459 --> 00:43:48,320
Totin' my old.44

1324
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:48,450
 

1325
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,580
Where you sleep out every night

1326
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:50,720
 

1327
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:53,990
Hello, Victoria?

1328
00:43:53,999 --> 00:43:54,090
 

1329
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:58,120
This is Sam Baldwin.I don't know if you remember me, but...

1330
00:43:58,129 --> 00:43:59,500
 

1331
00:43:59,509 --> 00:44:02,060
Oh, great. Hi.

1332
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:02,170
 

1333
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:06,190
I was wondering if...

1334
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:06,310
 

1335
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:10,400
if you would like.to have a drink with me?

1336
00:44:10,409 --> 00:44:10,510
 

1337
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:11,910
Dinner?

1338
00:44:11,919 --> 00:44:13,610
 

1339
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:16,880
Dinner would be even better.

1340
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:16,980
 

1341
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:20,470
Friday would be great.Yeah. How...

1342
00:44:20,479 --> 00:44:20,590
 

1343
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:23,050
I hear that's a good place.

1344
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:24,560
 

1345
00:44:24,569 --> 00:44:30,290
How... 7:30 would be fine.And I'Il...

1346
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:32,230
 

1347
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:35,460
Okay, I'll meet you there. Okay.

1348
00:44:35,469 --> 00:44:35,570
 

1349
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:39,160
So it's Friday...

1350
00:44:39,169 --> 00:44:39,270
 

1351
00:44:39,279 --> 00:44:41,540
at 7:30 for dinner.

1352
00:44:41,549 --> 00:44:41,640
 

1353
00:44:41,649 --> 00:44:43,040
Great.

1354
00:44:43,049 --> 00:44:44,610
 

1355
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:46,170
Me too. Bye.

1356
00:44:46,179 --> 00:44:46,280
 

1357
00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:51,220
Back in the saddle again

1358
00:44:51,229 --> 00:44:53,790
 

1359
00:44:53,799 --> 00:44:55,520
Are you in love with him?

1360
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:58,160
 

1361
00:44:58,169 --> 00:44:59,950
I'm not now.

1362
00:44:59,959 --> 00:45:00,830
 

1363
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:04,890
Now those were the days.when people knew how to be in love.

1364
00:45:04,899 --> 00:45:05,000
 

1365
00:45:05,009 --> 00:45:07,090
- You're a basket case.- They knew it.

1366
00:45:07,099 --> 00:45:07,200
 

1367
00:45:07,209 --> 00:45:12,400
Time, distance, nothing could separate.them, because they knew it was right.

1368
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:12,500
 

1369
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:15,530
- It was real. It was...- A movie.

1370
00:45:15,539 --> 00:45:15,640
 

1371
00:45:15,649 --> 00:45:17,540
That's your problem.You don't want to be in love.

1372
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:17,610
 

1373
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:19,740
You want to be.in love in a movie.

1374
00:45:19,749 --> 00:45:19,850
 

1375
00:45:19,859 --> 00:45:21,400
Read it to me.

1376
00:45:21,409 --> 00:45:23,220
 

1377
00:45:23,229 --> 00:45:27,240
"Dear Sleepless and Son, I have never.written a letter like this in my life."

1378
00:45:27,249 --> 00:45:27,350
 

1379
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,810
That's what everyone writes at.the beginning of letters to strangers.

1380
00:45:30,819 --> 00:45:30,960
 

1381
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:34,220
I know that.You think I don't know that?

1382
00:45:34,229 --> 00:45:34,330
 

1383
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:37,060
What about Walter?

1384
00:45:37,069 --> 00:45:37,160
 

1385
00:45:37,169 --> 00:45:41,120
Walter. Oh, I would.give anything to marry Walter.

1386
00:45:41,129 --> 00:45:41,230
 

1387
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,330
He's so unexpected.

1388
00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:43,440
 

1389
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:48,430
You think you can tell what he's like.by just looking at him, but you can't.

1390
00:45:48,439 --> 00:45:48,540
 

1391
00:45:48,549 --> 00:45:50,970
I should write something.in this about magic.

1392
00:45:50,979 --> 00:45:51,040
 

1393
00:45:51,049 --> 00:45:52,640
- What?.- Something.

1394
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:52,750
 

1395
00:45:52,759 --> 00:45:56,440
What if I never meet him? What if this.man is my destiny and I never meet him?

1396
00:45:56,449 --> 00:45:56,550
 

1397
00:45:56,559 --> 00:45:59,450
Your destiny can be your doom.Look at me and Rick.

1398
00:45:59,459 --> 00:45:59,550
 

1399
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:01,490
"I want to meet you..."

1400
00:46:01,499 --> 00:46:01,590
 

1401
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,950
- The top of the Empire State Building?.- The top of the Empire State Building.

1402
00:46:04,959 --> 00:46:05,060
 

1403
00:46:05,069 --> 00:46:06,820
That's perfect.

1404
00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:06,930
 

1405
00:46:06,939 --> 00:46:09,330
Sunset, Valentine's Day.

1406
00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:10,630
 

1407
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:14,730
I'II be in New York with Walter.I can squeeze it in.

1408
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:14,830
 

1409
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:17,600
I'll be in New York with Walter.

1410
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:24,380
 

1411
00:46:24,389 --> 00:46:26,640
Do you want to.hear about destiny?

1412
00:46:26,649 --> 00:46:26,750
 

1413
00:46:26,759 --> 00:46:30,610
If I hadn't married Martin, I wouldn't.have had the house with the dead tree.

1414
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:30,720
 

1415
00:46:30,729 --> 00:46:33,120
On account of which,I got divorced.

1416
00:46:33,129 --> 00:46:33,220
 

1417
00:46:33,229 --> 00:46:36,980
On account of which, I hit a car.and met Rick while buying a neck brace.

1418
00:46:36,989 --> 00:46:37,120
 

1419
00:46:37,129 --> 00:46:41,320
Wait. You never told me you got.a divorce because of a dead tree.

1420
00:46:41,329 --> 00:46:42,290
 

1421
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,690
The tree man.

1422
00:46:43,699 --> 00:46:43,800
 

1423
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:45,790
You fell in love.with the tree man?

1424
00:46:45,799 --> 00:46:45,900
 

1425
00:46:45,909 --> 00:46:48,700
I did not say "love.".Did I say "love"?

1426
00:46:48,709 --> 00:46:48,800
 

1427
00:46:48,809 --> 00:46:51,170
This is my favorite part.

1428
00:46:51,179 --> 00:46:53,240
 

1429
00:46:53,249 --> 00:46:55,140
It's now or never.

1430
00:46:55,149 --> 00:46:56,110
 

1431
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:58,340
"Never" is a frightening word.

1432
00:46:58,349 --> 00:46:59,650
 

1433
00:46:59,659 --> 00:47:02,410
We'd be fools.to let happiness pass us by.

1434
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:05,550
 

1435
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:09,210
Winter must be cold.for those with no warm memories.

1436
00:47:09,219 --> 00:47:11,960
 

1437
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:14,390
We've already missed the spring.

1438
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:17,100
 

1439
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:19,260
Men never get this movie.

1440
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:19,360
 

1441
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:20,920
I know.

1442
00:47:20,929 --> 00:47:23,070
 

1443
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:25,370
Mommy! Mommy!

1444
00:47:25,379 --> 00:47:28,840
 

1445
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:30,830
It's okay. I'm here.

1446
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:30,910
 

1447
00:47:30,919 --> 00:47:33,280
- Dad!.- I'm comin'.

1448
00:47:33,289 --> 00:47:33,380
 

1449
00:47:33,389 --> 00:47:35,440
It's all right. It's okay.

1450
00:47:35,449 --> 00:47:36,920
 

1451
00:47:36,929 --> 00:47:40,850
It's all right. It's okay.What was that about?

1452
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:40,950
 

1453
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:43,150
- It was sinking.- What was?

1454
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:43,290
 

1455
00:47:43,299 --> 00:47:46,590
Our house. There was water.coming in all the windows.

1456
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:48,260
 

1457
00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:50,490
Well, it's okay now.

1458
00:47:50,499 --> 00:47:51,600
 

1459
00:47:51,609 --> 00:47:55,260
It's all right.So what should we do?

1460
00:47:55,269 --> 00:47:55,370
 

1461
00:47:55,379 --> 00:47:57,770
Your mother used to...

1462
00:47:57,779 --> 00:47:57,870
 

1463
00:47:57,879 --> 00:48:00,270
sing to you.when you had bad dreams.

1464
00:48:00,279 --> 00:48:01,440
 

1465
00:48:01,449 --> 00:48:03,100
"Bye-Bye, Blackbird."

1466
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:06,140
 

1467
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:08,770
I miss her.

1468
00:48:08,779 --> 00:48:08,880
 

1469
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:11,710
What do you think happens.to someone after they die?

1470
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:13,150
 

1471
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:16,680
- I don't know.- Like, do you believe in heaven?

1472
00:48:16,689 --> 00:48:20,530
 

1473
00:48:20,539 --> 00:48:23,120
I never did.

1474
00:48:23,129 --> 00:48:23,230
 

1475
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:26,600
Or the whole idea of an afterlife,but now I don't know.

1476
00:48:26,609 --> 00:48:28,070
 

1477
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,400
'Cause I have.these dreams about...

1478
00:48:30,409 --> 00:48:31,770
 

1479
00:48:31,779 --> 00:48:34,100
about your mom.

1480
00:48:34,109 --> 00:48:35,440
 

1481
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:39,540
And we have long talks...

1482
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:39,610
 

1483
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:43,140
about you,how you're doin'.

1484
00:48:43,149 --> 00:48:43,250
 

1485
00:48:43,259 --> 00:48:46,950
Which she sort of knows,but I tell her anyway.

1486
00:48:46,959 --> 00:48:47,050
 

1487
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:49,280
So what is that?

1488
00:48:49,289 --> 00:48:51,460
 

1489
00:48:51,469 --> 00:48:53,650
It's sort of an afterlife,isn't it?

1490
00:48:53,659 --> 00:48:54,690
 

1491
00:48:54,699 --> 00:48:56,420
I'm starting to forget her.

1492
00:48:56,429 --> 00:49:12,840
 

1493
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:16,180
She could peel an apple...

1494
00:49:16,189 --> 00:49:17,550
 

1495
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:20,020
in one long...

1496
00:49:20,029 --> 00:49:20,120
 

1497
00:49:20,129 --> 00:49:22,020
curly strip.

1498
00:49:22,029 --> 00:49:23,860
 

1499
00:49:23,869 --> 00:49:25,950
The whole apple.

1500
00:49:25,959 --> 00:49:26,090
 

1501
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:28,890
Pack up all my cares and woes

1502
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:30,160
 

1503
00:49:30,169 --> 00:49:32,790
Feelin' low

1504
00:49:32,799 --> 00:49:32,900
 

1505
00:49:32,909 --> 00:49:34,660
Here I go

1506
00:49:34,669 --> 00:49:34,770
 

1507
00:49:34,779 --> 00:49:38,730
I say bye- bye

1508
00:49:38,739 --> 00:49:38,840
 

1509
00:49:38,849 --> 00:49:40,300
I love you, Jonah.

1510
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:41,340
 

1511
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:43,710
I love you, Dad.

1512
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:49,780
 

1513
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:51,680
See you tomorrow.

1514
00:49:51,689 --> 00:49:53,320
 

1515
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:57,950
Sugar's sweet.So is she

1516
00:49:57,959 --> 00:49:58,090
 

1517
00:49:58,099 --> 00:50:00,520
I say bye

1518
00:50:00,529 --> 00:50:00,630
 

1519
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:02,920
Bye

1520
00:50:02,929 --> 00:50:03,030
 

1521
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:04,930
Blackbird

1522
00:50:04,939 --> 00:50:11,200
 

1523
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:15,440
No one seems to love

1524
00:50:15,449 --> 00:50:15,540
 

1525
00:50:15,549 --> 00:50:19,480
Or understand me now

1526
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:23,150
 

1527
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:26,120
Oh, and hard luck stories

1528
00:50:26,129 --> 00:50:27,750
 

1529
00:50:27,759 --> 00:50:30,750
They keep handin' me, yeah

1530
00:50:30,759 --> 00:50:34,760
 

1531
00:50:34,769 --> 00:50:38,360
Where somebody shines a light

1532
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:40,530
 

1533
00:50:40,539 --> 00:50:44,530
I'm comin' on home tonight now

1534
00:50:44,539 --> 00:50:44,640

I wanna say.Bye- bye, blackbird

1538
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:52,780
 

1539
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:54,680
Lord have mercy

1540
00:50:54,689 --> 00:50:55,850
 

1541
00:50:55,859 --> 00:50:57,820
Somebody love me now

1542
00:50:57,829 --> 00:51:05,690
 

1543
00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:08,890
Laurie?.Hi, it's Annie.

1544
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:08,990
 

1545
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:10,990
Fine. I'm fine.

1546
00:51:10,999 --> 00:51:11,130
 

1547
00:51:11,139 --> 00:51:14,760
Listen. I'm doing an article.on call-in radio shows.

1548
00:51:14,769 --> 00:51:14,870
 

1549
00:51:14,879 --> 00:51:18,530
Do you know anyone who works for.someone named Dr. Marcia Fieldstone?

1550
00:51:18,539 --> 00:51:18,640
 

1551
00:51:18,649 --> 00:51:21,800
I'm a writer for the Baltimore Sun.and a friend of Laurie Johnson's.

1552
00:51:21,809 --> 00:51:21,910
 

1553
00:51:21,919 --> 00:51:24,570
I'm doing a piece on how.people handle bereavement...

1554
00:51:24,579 --> 00:51:24,640
 

1555
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:28,670
and I understand you had a caller.the other night, some guy from Seattle.

1556
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:37,020
 

1557
00:51:37,029 --> 00:51:40,150
This is Jonah Baldwin. We're not in.right now, but you can leave...

1558
00:51:40,159 --> 00:52:44,660

Architect.

1560
00:52:46,069 --> 00:53:20,690
 

1561
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:23,920

1563
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:26,550
or 8:30, if disaster strikes.

1564
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:26,670
 

1565
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:28,660
Here's one for both of us.

1566
00:53:28,669 --> 00:53:28,770
 

1567
00:53:28,779 --> 00:53:31,430
- "Sleepless and Son, Baltimore.".- I left the restaurant's phone number.

1568
00:53:31,439 --> 00:53:31,540
 

1569
00:53:31,549 --> 00:53:34,940
If there's a problem, the pediatrician's.number is right above the phone.

1570
00:53:34,949 --> 00:53:35,040

1579
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,910
I was gonna get a haircut,but then I'd look like I got one.

1580
00:53:50,919 --> 00:53:51,060
 

1581
00:53:51,069 --> 00:53:54,180

Brooks Robinson.was the best third baseman ever.

1598
00:54:15,759 --> 00:54:15,850
 

1599
00:54:15,859 --> 00:54:18,250

She's on her sixth painter...

1696
00:57:19,209 --> 00:57:19,330
 

1697
00:57:19,339 --> 00:57:21,230

1707
00:57:35,989 --> 00:57:38,850
Whenever she wants anything done,she does this song and dance about...

1708
00:57:38,859 --> 00:57:38,950
 

1709
00:57:38,959 --> 00:57:41,180

so everything on one side is now on the.other, and the back becomes the front?

1714
00:57:47,989 --> 00:57:48,130
 

1715
00:57:48,139 --> 00:57:50,120
Could the whole house.open up on a hinge?

1716
00:57:50,129 --> 00:57:50,260
 

1717
00:57:50,269 --> 00:57:53,660

1718
00:57:53,669 --> 00:57:53,800
 

1719

1720
00:57:57,369 --> 00:57:57,470

You're right. Camping is good.Time for bed.

1738
00:58:35,009 --> 00:58:35,110

00:58:37,409 --> 00:58:37,480
 

1741
00:58:37,489 --> 00:58:39,530
Time for bed.

1742
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:39,640
 

1743
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:41,270
Good night.

1744
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:45,420
 

1745
00:58:45,429 --> 00:58:48,480
Don't you wanna thank Victoria.for this delicious dinner?

1746
00:58:48,489 --> 00:58:48,590
 

1747
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:52,450
Thanks for dinner. I never saw.anybody cook potatoes that way.

1748
00:58:52,459 --> 00:58:53,930
 

1749
00:58:53,939 --> 00:58:56,190
I'm glad you liked it.

1750
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:56,290
 

1751
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:58,190
Good night, Jonah.

1752
00:58:58,199 --> 00:59:01,070
 

1753
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,760
Yeah, we don't see.a lot of potatoes around here.

1754
00:59:03,769 --> 00:59:03,870
 

1755
00:59:03,879 --> 00:59:05,770
We're rice men.

1756
00:59:05,779 --> 01:00:00,830
 

1757
01:00:00,839 --> 01:00:03,450
I'm sorry, Walter.I'm sorry.

1758
01:00:03,459 --> 01:00:07,730
 

1759
01:00:07,739 --> 01:00:10,000
- Hello?.- Turn on your radio.

1760
01:00:10,009 --> 01:00:10,100
 

1761
01:00:10,109 --> 01:00:12,000
- What?.- The kid is on.

1762
01:00:12,009 --> 01:00:12,100
 

1763
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:14,660
You've got me.listening to this garbage.

1764
01:00:14,669 --> 01:00:14,770
 

1765
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:17,140
Who is it?

1766
01:00:17,149 --> 01:00:17,210
 

1767
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:21,340
It's Becky. She's...She's having trouble with Rick again.

1768
01:00:21,349 --> 01:00:21,450
 

1769
01:00:21,459 --> 01:00:24,350
I'll go downstairs, Becky.I'll call you back.

1770
01:00:24,359 --> 01:00:27,190
 

1771
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:29,810
I'm sorry, Walter.Are you bleeding?

1772
01:00:29,819 --> 01:00:50,840
 

1773
01:00:50,849 --> 01:00:53,970
- He's kissing her right this minute!.- Oh, really?

1774
01:00:53,979 --> 01:00:54,050
 

1775
01:00:54,059 --> 01:00:57,740
Jonah, tell the truth.Are you spying on your father?

1776
01:00:57,749 --> 01:00:57,850
 

1777
01:00:57,859 --> 01:01:00,940
- Who's he kissing right this minute?.- Listen to this.

1778
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:01,050
 

1779
01:01:01,059 --> 01:01:02,950
I have to make them stop.

1780
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:03,090
 

1781
01:01:03,099 --> 01:01:06,610
- How am I gonna explain this to Walter?.- She came over and cooked dinner.

1782
01:01:06,619 --> 01:01:06,760
 

1783
01:01:06,769 --> 01:01:09,820
She brought two bags of groceries,like she was staying for a year.

1784
01:01:09,829 --> 01:01:09,960
 

1785
01:01:09,969 --> 01:01:12,860
Jonah, it's good.that your father's dating.

1786
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:12,960
 

1787
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:16,200
It's just hard on you.It's something you think you want.

1788
01:01:16,209 --> 01:01:16,300
 

1789
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:20,070
- Then when it happens, it scares you.- That's not true.

1790
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:20,170
 

1791
01:01:20,179 --> 01:01:23,110
Think. Shouldn't your father.be the judge....

1792
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:23,210
 

1793
01:01:23,219 --> 01:01:26,110
of whether someone is right.or wrong for him?

1794
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:26,180
 

1795
01:01:26,189 --> 01:01:28,150
He's not sane enough.to judge anything.

1796
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:28,250
 

1797
01:01:28,259 --> 01:01:30,980
Now he's kissing her on the lips.She's a 'ho!

1798
01:01:30,989 --> 01:01:31,080
 

1799
01:01:31,089 --> 01:01:34,140
My dad's been captured by a 'ho!.What am I going to do?

1800
01:01:34,149 --> 01:01:34,250
 

1801
01:01:34,259 --> 01:01:36,190
Calm down, Jonah.

1802
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:36,320
 

1803
01:01:36,329 --> 01:01:38,980
Tomorrow morning when you're.having breakfast with your dad....

1804
01:01:38,989 --> 01:01:39,120
 

1805
01:01:39,129 --> 01:01:41,420
tell him how you feel.

1806
01:01:41,429 --> 01:01:41,530
 

1807
01:01:41,539 --> 01:01:44,980
It's not good to keep.your feelings inside you.

1808
01:01:44,989 --> 01:01:49,330
 

1809
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:53,000
Miss Scarlet. In the broom closet.With the radio.

1810
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:56,240
 

1811
01:01:56,249 --> 01:01:59,140
You scared me.Don't ever do that again.

1812
01:01:59,149 --> 01:02:02,750
 

1813
01:02:02,759 --> 01:02:05,740
- I thought I saw a black widow.- You scared me to death!

1814
01:02:05,749 --> 01:02:05,850
 

1815
01:02:05,859 --> 01:02:09,120
- You scared Victoria to death.- It was right over there.

1816
01:02:09,129 --> 01:02:09,250
 

1817
01:02:09,259 --> 01:02:12,880
The next time you think you see a.black widow spider, I want you to say...

1818
01:02:12,889 --> 01:02:13,020
 

1819
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:16,890
"Dad, excuse me, but I believe.a poisonous insect is in the house''...

1820
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:16,990
 

1821
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:19,160
and I will calmly come.and take care of it.

1822
01:02:19,169 --> 01:02:19,260
 

1823
01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:20,790
Scream again, I'll kill you.

1824
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:20,900
 

1825
01:02:20,909 --> 01:02:25,390
Becky heard this guy on the radio she.was sure was Rick. She was hysterical.

1826
01:02:25,399 --> 01:02:25,500
 

1827
01:02:25,509 --> 01:02:29,670
And then it turned out.the guy lived in Duluth.

1828
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:29,770
 

1829
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:32,680
- Where is Duluth?.- That doesn't make any sense.

1830
01:02:32,689 --> 01:02:32,740
 

1831
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:36,200
I know, Walter.It doesn't make any sense at all.

1832
01:02:36,209 --> 01:02:36,310
 

1833
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,910
Thank God my life is in place.

1834
01:02:38,919 --> 01:02:39,020
 

1835
01:02:39,029 --> 01:02:41,880
Duluth? That's in North Dakota.

1836
01:02:41,889 --> 01:02:55,930
 

1837
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:59,890
I love this letter.You have to write to her.

1838
01:02:59,899 --> 01:03:00,000
 

1839
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:03,100
- You think so?.- It's Y.O.H.

1840
01:03:03,109 --> 01:03:03,210
 

1841
01:03:03,219 --> 01:03:05,370
Yeah. What's that?

1842
01:03:05,379 --> 01:03:05,440
 

1843
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:07,040
Your only hope.

1844
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:19,160
 

1845
01:03:19,169 --> 01:03:22,350
I thought I would look into.doing a story on those radio shows.

1846
01:03:22,359 --> 01:03:23,830
 

1847
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:26,130
You'd probably have to go somewhere.to really look into it.

1848
01:03:26,139 --> 01:03:26,800
 

1849
01:03:26,809 --> 01:03:28,930
Definitely.

1850
01:03:28,939 --> 01:03:47,620
 

1851
01:03:47,629 --> 01:03:49,710
Couldn't you do.a phone interview?

1852
01:03:49,719 --> 01:03:49,850
 

1853
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:54,380
Not for the kind of piece I wanna do.I won't be in Chicago that long.

1854
01:03:54,389 --> 01:03:54,530
 

1855
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:56,550
When you get back, I'll be gone.

1856
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:56,690
 

1857
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:59,130
And then I'll see you in New York.

1858
01:03:59,139 --> 01:03:59,230
 

1859
01:03:59,239 --> 01:04:00,990
I'll get it.

1860
01:04:00,999 --> 01:04:05,000
 

1861
01:04:05,009 --> 01:04:06,400
This is Captain Browning.

1862
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:06,500
 

1863
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:10,070
We're at our cruising altitude.of approximately 35,000 feet.

1864
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:10,170
 

1865
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:14,940
The weather is clear to the west, and we.expect to arrive in Seattle on schedule.

1866
01:04:14,949 --> 01:04:16,010
 

1867
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:18,880
- Don't you hate flying?.- Yes, I do.

1868
01:04:18,889 --> 01:04:18,980
 

1869
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:23,850
And I just told the most terrible one.to the man I'm about to marry.

1870
01:04:23,859 --> 01:04:23,990
 

1871
01:04:23,999 --> 01:04:26,720
Do you feel that.any lie is a betrayal?

1872
01:04:26,729 --> 01:04:27,790
 

1873
01:04:27,799 --> 01:04:29,730
I said ''flying."

1874
01:04:29,739 --> 01:04:37,740
 

1875
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:39,640
Thanks for bringing me out here.

1876
01:04:39,649 --> 01:04:39,740
 

1877
01:04:39,749 --> 01:04:42,140
Well, he likes the planes.

1878
01:04:42,149 --> 01:04:42,240
 

1879
01:04:42,249 --> 01:04:46,610
Can I bring something back for you?.A souvenir? Does he like snow globes?

1880
01:04:46,619 --> 01:04:46,680
 

1881
01:04:46,689 --> 01:04:49,110
You shake them up.and then the snow floats down.

1882
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:49,210
 

1883
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:52,880
Sure. I'd really like that.Thank you so much.

1884
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:57,120
 

1885
01:04:57,129 --> 01:04:59,180
- He's eight.- He's good at it.

1886
01:04:59,189 --> 01:04:59,320
 

1887
01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:01,220
I read an article about this.

1888
01:05:01,229 --> 01:05:01,330
 

1889
01:05:01,339 --> 01:05:04,390
All children are hideous at age eight.It's quite normal.

1890
01:05:04,399 --> 01:05:04,530
 

1891
01:05:04,539 --> 01:05:06,720
Well, maybe when I come back...

1892
01:05:06,729 --> 01:05:06,830
 

1893
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:10,160
the two of us oughta spend.some time together on our own.

1894
01:05:10,169 --> 01:05:10,270
 

1895
01:05:10,279 --> 01:05:12,290
What do you think?

1896
01:05:12,299 --> 01:05:15,570
 

1897
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:17,470
Bye.

1898
01:05:17,479 --> 01:05:17,540
 

1899
01:05:17,549 --> 01:05:19,170
Bye, Jonah.

1900
01:05:19,179 --> 01:05:26,620
 

1901
01:05:26,629 --> 01:05:30,180
Listen to me.You don't know Victoria.

1902
01:05:30,189 --> 01:05:30,320
 

1903
01:05:30,329 --> 01:05:32,220
I hardly know her myself.

1904
01:05:32,229 --> 01:05:32,320
 

1905
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:35,220
She is, in fact,a mystery to me.

1906
01:05:35,229 --> 01:05:35,330
 

1907
01:05:35,339 --> 01:05:38,630
She tosses her hair a lot.Why does she do this?

1908
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:38,730
 

1909
01:05:38,739 --> 01:05:41,560
I have no idea. Is it a twitch?.Does she need a haircut?

1910
01:05:41,569 --> 01:05:41,670
 

1911
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:45,160
Should she use a barrette.to keep her hair out of her face?

1912
01:05:45,169 --> 01:05:46,670
 

1913
01:05:46,679 --> 01:05:49,830
These are things I'm willing.to get to the bottom of.

1914
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:49,940
 

1915
01:05:49,949 --> 01:05:53,270
And that is why I am dating her.

1916
01:05:53,279 --> 01:05:54,510
 

1917
01:05:54,519 --> 01:05:56,570
That's all I'm doing.

1918
01:05:56,579 --> 01:05:56,680
 

1919
01:05:56,689 --> 01:05:58,950
I'm not living with her.I'm not marrying her.

1920
01:05:58,959 --> 01:05:59,050
 

1921
01:05:59,059 --> 01:06:01,810
Can you appreciate.the difference?

1922
01:06:01,819 --> 01:06:03,320
 

1923
01:06:03,329 --> 01:06:04,750
This is what single people do.

1924
01:06:04,759 --> 01:06:04,890
 

1925
01:06:04,899 --> 01:06:07,690
They try other people on.and see how they fit.

1926
01:06:07,699 --> 01:06:07,790
 

1927
01:06:07,799 --> 01:06:10,520
But everybody's an adjustment.Nobody's perfect.

1928
01:06:10,529 --> 01:06:11,500
 

1929
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:14,060
There's no such thing.as a perfect...

1930
01:06:14,069 --> 01:06:30,250
 

1931
01:06:30,259 --> 01:06:31,810
Come on.

1932
01:06:31,819 --> 01:06:34,320
 

1933
01:06:34,329 --> 01:06:37,480
Dad, I was talking to Jessica.about reincarnation.

1934
01:06:37,489 --> 01:06:37,620
 

1935
01:06:37,629 --> 01:06:39,650
She says you knew Annie.in another life.

1936
01:06:39,659 --> 01:06:39,790
 

1937
01:06:39,799 --> 01:06:42,280
- Who's Annie?.- The one who wrote us.

1938
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:42,430
 

1939
01:06:42,439 --> 01:06:45,880
But Jessica says you and Annie.never got together in that life.

1940
01:06:45,889 --> 01:06:46,030
 

1941
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:48,660
So your hearts are like puzzles.with missing pieces.

1942
01:06:48,669 --> 01:06:48,770
 

1943
01:06:48,779 --> 01:06:50,930
And when you get together,the puzzle's complete.

1944
01:06:50,939 --> 01:06:51,040
 

1945
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:52,530
Goddamn it.

1946
01:06:52,539 --> 01:06:52,640
 

1947
01:06:52,649 --> 01:06:55,660
The reason I know this and you don't.is because I'm younger and purer...

1948
01:06:55,669 --> 01:06:55,770
 

1949
01:06:55,779 --> 01:06:58,870
so I'm more in touch.with cosmic forces.

1950
01:06:58,879 --> 01:06:58,940
 

1951
01:06:58,949 --> 01:07:01,740
- Who told you this stuff?.- Jessica.

1952
01:07:01,749 --> 01:07:01,850
 

1953
01:07:01,859 --> 01:07:04,680
I sincerely hope.you're not marrying Jessica.

1954
01:07:04,689 --> 01:07:11,120
 

1955
01:07:11,129 --> 01:07:15,620
I remember the days.of just keepin' time

1956
01:07:15,629 --> 01:07:15,760
 

1957
01:07:15,769 --> 01:07:20,030
Of hangin' around.in sleepy towns

1958
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:20,130
 

1959
01:07:20,139 --> 01:07:22,260
Forever

1960
01:07:22,269 --> 01:07:22,370
 

1961
01:07:22,379 --> 01:07:26,200
Back roads empty for miles

1962
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:28,170
 

1963
01:07:28,179 --> 01:07:32,580
Well, you can't have a dream.and cut it to fit

1964
01:07:32,589 --> 01:07:32,640
 

1965
01:07:32,649 --> 01:07:36,440
But when I saw you.I knew

1966
01:07:36,449 --> 01:07:36,550
 

1967
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,980
We'd go together

1968
01:07:38,989 --> 01:07:39,080
 

1969
01:07:39,089 --> 01:07:42,420
Like a wink and a smile

1970
01:07:42,429 --> 01:07:46,120
 

1971
01:07:46,129 --> 01:07:50,030
Leave your old jalopy

1972
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:50,160
 

1973
01:07:50,169 --> 01:07:54,290
By the railroad track

1974
01:07:54,299 --> 01:07:54,400
 

1975
01:07:54,409 --> 01:07:58,560
We'll get a hip.double-dip, tip-toppy

1976
01:07:58,569 --> 01:07:58,670
 

1977
01:07:58,679 --> 01:08:01,760
Two-seat Pontiac

1978
01:08:01,769 --> 01:08:04,140
 

1979
01:08:04,149 --> 01:08:07,240
So you can rev her up

1980
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:07,340
 

1981
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:09,240
Don't go slow

1982
01:08:09,249 --> 01:08:09,350
 

1983
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:12,780
It's only green lights.and all rights

1984
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:12,880
 

1985
01:08:12,889 --> 01:08:16,010
Let's go together

1986
01:08:16,019 --> 01:08:16,120
 

1987
01:08:16,129 --> 01:08:18,880
With a wink and a smile

1988
01:08:18,889 --> 01:08:33,270
 

1989
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:36,210
Give me a wink and a smile

1990
01:08:36,219 --> 01:08:48,150
 

1991
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:50,050
We go together

1992
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:50,190
 

1993
01:08:50,199 --> 01:08:52,880
Like a wink and a smile

1994
01:08:52,889 --> 01:08:56,860
 

1995
01:08:56,869 --> 01:09:00,420
Now my heart hears music

1996
01:09:00,429 --> 01:09:00,530
 

1997
01:09:00,539 --> 01:09:03,260
Such a simple song

1998
01:09:03,269 --> 01:09:04,870
 

1999
01:09:04,879 --> 01:09:08,810
Sing it again.The notes never end

2000
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:08,910
 

2001
01:09:08,919 --> 01:09:12,310
This is where I belong

2002
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,610
 

2003
01:09:13,619 --> 01:09:17,170
Just the sound of your voice.The light in your eyes

2004
01:09:17,179 --> 01:09:17,280
 

2005
01:09:17,289 --> 01:09:21,840
We're so far away.from yesterday

2006
01:09:21,849 --> 01:09:21,950
 

2007
01:09:21,959 --> 01:09:24,480
Together

2008
01:09:24,489 --> 01:09:24,620
 

2009
01:09:24,629 --> 01:09:27,750
With a wink and a smile

2010
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:30,730
 

2011
01:09:30,739 --> 01:09:34,390
We go together

2012
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:34,500
 

2013
01:09:34,509 --> 01:09:38,370
Like a wink and a smile

2014
01:09:38,379 --> 01:09:48,410
 

2015
01:09:48,419 --> 01:09:52,110
- I watched him play with his son.- Did you talk to him?

2016
01:09:52,119 --> 01:09:53,220
 

2017
01:09:53,229 --> 01:09:55,120
I couldn't do it.

2018
01:09:55,129 --> 01:09:57,290
 

2019
01:09:57,299 --> 01:10:00,690
- How did I get here?.- You told a lie and got on a plane.

2020
01:10:00,699 --> 01:10:00,790
 

2021
01:10:00,799 --> 01:10:02,730
That's not what I mean.

2022
01:10:02,739 --> 01:10:04,200
 

2023
01:10:04,209 --> 01:10:08,060
I'm going back over there tomorrow.and talk to him. I am.

2024
01:10:08,069 --> 01:10:08,170
 

2025
01:10:08,179 --> 01:10:11,230
Okay. Good.Good-bye.

2026
01:10:11,239 --> 01:10:11,340
 

2027
01:10:11,349 --> 01:10:13,240
- Beck?.- What?

2028
01:10:13,249 --> 01:10:15,740
 

2029
01:10:15,749 --> 01:10:18,040
- Is this crazy?.- No.

2030
01:10:18,049 --> 01:10:18,110
 

2031
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:20,440
That's the weirdest part about it.

2032
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:21,550
 

2033
01:10:21,559 --> 01:10:24,240
Thank you.I love you.

2034
01:10:24,249 --> 01:10:24,350
 

2035
01:10:24,359 --> 01:10:26,940
- I love you too.- Good night.

2036
01:10:26,949 --> 01:11:29,580
 

2037
01:11:29,589 --> 01:11:32,980
Oh, it's so good to see you.Where's Greg?

2038
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:57,270
 

2039
01:11:57,279 --> 01:11:58,170
Hello.

2040
01:11:58,179 --> 01:12:07,520
 

2041
01:12:07,529 --> 01:12:11,650
- So then what happened?.- So then I left, obviously.

2042
01:12:11,659 --> 01:12:12,560
 

2043
01:12:12,569 --> 01:12:14,490
You were standing.in the middle of the street?

2044
01:12:14,499 --> 01:12:14,590
 

2045
01:12:14,599 --> 01:12:18,360
You know that dream when you're on the.street naked and everyone is looking?

2046
01:12:18,369 --> 01:12:18,460
 

2047
01:12:18,469 --> 01:12:20,120
I love that dream.

2048
01:12:20,129 --> 01:12:20,230
 

2049
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:23,830
That was nothing compared.to this humiliation. Nothing.

2050
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:23,930
 

2051
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:25,960
- But he saw you, right?.- He saw me.

2052
01:12:25,969 --> 01:12:26,070
 

2053
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:29,530
- You were face-to-face?.- He said hello.

2054
01:12:29,539 --> 01:12:29,640
 

2055
01:12:29,649 --> 01:12:33,040
- He said hello, and what did you say?.- All I could say was hello.

2056
01:12:33,049 --> 01:12:34,110
 

2057
01:12:34,119 --> 01:12:35,940
Oh, my God!

2058
01:12:35,949 --> 01:12:36,050
 

2059
01:12:36,059 --> 01:12:39,880
And all I could say was hello.

2060
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:39,980
 

2061
01:12:39,989 --> 01:12:42,010
It's a sign.

2062
01:12:42,019 --> 01:12:42,120
 

2063
01:12:42,129 --> 01:12:46,280
It's a sign that I have watched.this movie too many times.

2064
01:12:46,289 --> 01:12:47,420
 

2065
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:49,020
So stupid.

2066
01:12:49,029 --> 01:12:49,160
 

2067
01:12:49,169 --> 01:12:54,030
Since I listened to that stupid program.on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.

2068
01:12:54,039 --> 01:12:54,130
 

2069
01:12:54,139 --> 01:12:56,790
- You are not a jerk.- Thank you.

2070
01:12:56,799 --> 01:12:56,900
 

2071
01:12:56,909 --> 01:13:00,030
- Idiot.- You don't know who she was.

2072
01:13:00,039 --> 01:13:00,140
 

2073
01:13:00,149 --> 01:13:04,040
I saw her. I have a picture of her.I'II show you a picture of her.

2074
01:13:04,049 --> 01:13:04,110
 

2075
01:13:04,119 --> 01:13:06,940
That detective in Seattle.sent me a picture of her.

2076
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:07,040
 

2077
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:08,940
Here. See?

2078
01:13:08,949 --> 01:13:09,050
 

2079
01:13:09,059 --> 01:13:11,380
That's exactly.what she looks like.

2080
01:13:11,389 --> 01:13:11,480
 

2081
01:13:11,489 --> 01:13:13,640
This is a picture.of someone's back.

2082
01:13:13,649 --> 01:13:13,750
 

2083
01:13:13,759 --> 01:13:16,980
Well, it's her.and he was crazy about her.

2084
01:13:16,989 --> 01:13:17,120
 

2085
01:13:17,129 --> 01:13:20,490
What's this?.This is from Seattle.

2086
01:13:20,499 --> 01:13:32,470
 

2087
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:34,370
So I mailed your letter.

2088
01:13:34,379 --> 01:13:36,770
 

2089
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:39,570
"Dear Annie,thanks for your letter.

2090
01:13:39,579 --> 01:13:39,640
 

2091
01:13:39,649 --> 01:13:42,770
It was great.You sound neat.

2092
01:13:42,779 --> 01:13:46,120
 

2093
01:13:46,129 --> 01:13:49,810
We're very excited about meeting you.in New York on Valentine's Day...

2094
01:13:49,819 --> 01:13:49,950
 

2095
01:13:49,959 --> 01:13:52,750
and seeing if we are...

2096
01:13:52,759 --> 01:13:52,860
 

2097
01:13:52,869 --> 01:13:55,350
M.F.E.O.

2098
01:13:55,359 --> 01:13:55,490
 

2099
01:13:55,499 --> 01:13:56,890
See you soon.

2100
01:13:56,899 --> 01:13:57,690
 

2101
01:13:57,699 --> 01:14:00,460
Sleepless in Seattle."

2102
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:00,560
 

2103
01:14:00,569 --> 01:14:01,790
M.F. E.O.?

2104
01:14:01,799 --> 01:14:06,340
 

2105
01:14:06,349 --> 01:14:08,960
Made for each other.

2106
01:14:08,969 --> 01:14:09,970
 

2107
01:14:09,979 --> 01:14:13,240
It's cute.It's like a little clue.

2108
01:14:13,249 --> 01:14:17,850
 

2109
01:14:17,859 --> 01:14:21,080
So he can't write. Big deal.

2110
01:14:21,089 --> 01:14:21,190
 

2111
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:23,980
Verbal ability is a highly.overrated thing in a guy...

2112
01:14:23,989 --> 01:14:24,120
 

2113
01:14:24,129 --> 01:14:26,990
and our pathetic need for it.is what gets us into trouble.

2114
01:14:26,999 --> 01:14:27,090
 

2115
01:14:27,099 --> 01:14:30,960
I will be running back to Walter's arms,if he'll still have me.

2116
01:14:30,969 --> 01:14:31,060
 

2117
01:14:31,069 --> 01:14:33,050
- What about the letter?.- It means nothing.

2118
01:14:33,059 --> 01:14:33,200
 

2119
01:14:33,209 --> 01:14:36,390
It was written before.I went out there, before the 'ho.

2120
01:14:36,399 --> 01:14:39,900
 

2121
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:43,340
The only thing is,she didn't look like a 'ho.

2122
01:14:43,349 --> 01:14:43,440
 

2123
01:14:43,449 --> 01:14:46,270
She looked like somebody.we would've been friends with.

2124
01:14:46,279 --> 01:14:50,910
 

2125
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:53,780
- You saw her in the airport, then here?.- I tried to talk to her.

2126
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:53,880
 

2127
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:56,250
It was like I knew her.It was weird.

2128
01:14:56,259 --> 01:14:56,390
 

2129
01:14:56,399 --> 01:14:57,750
Like a déj?vu thing?

2130
01:14:57,759 --> 01:14:57,890
 

2131
01:14:57,899 --> 01:15:01,980
It was a very French.déj?vu-ish kind of thing. Oui.

2132
01:15:01,989 --> 01:15:02,130
 

2133
01:15:02,139 --> 01:15:05,580
At least you're out there.seeing people again. That's terrific.

2134
01:15:05,589 --> 01:15:05,730
 

2135
01:15:05,739 --> 01:15:07,660
Well, there's really just the one.

2136
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:08,270
 

2137
01:15:08,279 --> 01:15:10,630
Victoria.

2138
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:10,730
 

2139
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:13,530
- You don't like Victoria?.- She laughs like a hyena.

2140
01:15:13,539 --> 01:15:14,300
 

2141
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:16,200
Is this true?

2142
01:15:16,209 --> 01:15:17,510
 

2143
01:15:17,519 --> 01:15:20,530
Sort of, a little bit.Tell them what you did.

2144
01:15:20,539 --> 01:15:21,850
 

2145
01:15:21,859 --> 01:15:24,280
Tell 'em about the radio show.They wanna hear it.

2146
01:15:24,289 --> 01:15:24,380
 

2147
01:15:24,389 --> 01:15:29,180
Tell 'em. Christmas Eve, he phones in.one of those radio call-in shows.

2148
01:15:29,189 --> 01:15:29,290
 

2149
01:15:29,299 --> 01:15:32,260
Tells them I need a new wife.

2150
01:15:32,269 --> 01:15:32,360
 

2151
01:15:32,369 --> 01:15:34,050
Oh, you're kidding.

2152
01:15:34,059 --> 01:15:34,190
 

2153
01:15:34,199 --> 01:15:36,130
That's so sweet.

2154
01:15:36,139 --> 01:15:36,260
 

2155
01:15:36,269 --> 01:15:40,200
- He's obsessed with a lady who wrote me.- You serious?

2156
01:15:40,209 --> 01:15:40,330
 

2157
01:15:40,339 --> 01:15:43,270
She wants to meet me at the top.of the Empire State Building.

2158
01:15:43,279 --> 01:15:43,370
 

2159
01:15:43,379 --> 01:15:45,840
On Valentine's Day.

2160
01:15:45,849 --> 01:15:45,940
 

2161
01:15:45,949 --> 01:15:48,600
- It's like that movie.- What movie?

2162
01:15:48,609 --> 01:15:48,710
 

2163
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:51,570
An Affair To Remember.Did you ever see it?

2164
01:15:51,579 --> 01:15:51,640
 

2165
01:15:51,649 --> 01:15:53,610
Oh, God.

2166
01:15:53,619 --> 01:15:53,710
 

2167
01:15:53,719 --> 01:15:56,910
Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.Is it "car" or "cur"?

2168
01:15:56,919 --> 01:15:57,010
 

2169
01:15:57,019 --> 01:15:58,540
- Cur.- Car.

2170
01:15:58,549 --> 01:16:00,520
 

2171
01:16:00,529 --> 01:16:03,210
She's gonna meet him at the top.of the Empire State Building...

2172
01:16:03,219 --> 01:16:03,320
 

2173
01:16:03,329 --> 01:16:05,850
only she got hit by a taxi.

2174
01:16:05,859 --> 01:16:05,990
 

2175
01:16:05,999 --> 01:16:07,890
And he waited and waited.

2176
01:16:07,899 --> 01:16:07,990
 

2177
01:16:07,999 --> 01:16:10,930
And it was raining, I think.

2178
01:16:10,939 --> 01:16:11,060
 

2179
01:16:11,069 --> 01:16:12,090
And then...

2180
01:16:12,099 --> 01:16:12,230
 

2181
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:15,460
she's too proud to tell him...

2182
01:16:15,469 --> 01:16:15,570
 

2183
01:16:15,579 --> 01:16:17,690
that she's, uh...

2184
01:16:17,699 --> 01:16:20,140
 

2185
01:16:20,149 --> 01:16:22,130
crippled.

2186
01:16:22,139 --> 01:16:22,240
 

2187
01:16:22,249 --> 01:16:26,040
And he's too proud to find out.why she doesn't come.

2188
01:16:26,049 --> 01:16:26,110
 

2189
01:16:26,119 --> 01:16:28,040
But he comes to see her anyway.

2190
01:16:28,049 --> 01:16:28,150
 

2191
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:30,410
I forget why, but, oh...

2192
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:30,510
 

2193
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:34,780
Oh, it's so amazing.when he comes to see her because...

2194
01:16:34,789 --> 01:16:34,890
 

2195
01:16:34,899 --> 01:16:38,950
he doesn't even notice that.she doesn't get up to say hello.

2196
01:16:38,959 --> 01:16:39,090
 

2197
01:16:39,099 --> 01:16:41,520
And he's very bitter.

2198
01:16:41,529 --> 01:16:42,960
 

2199
01:16:42,969 --> 01:16:47,330
And you think that he's just gonna.walk out the door...

2200
01:16:47,339 --> 01:16:47,430
 

2201
01:16:47,439 --> 01:16:52,100
and never know why she's just.lying there, you know, on the couch...

2202
01:16:52,109 --> 01:16:52,200
 

2203
01:16:52,209 --> 01:16:56,610
with this blanket.over her shriveled little legs.

2204
01:16:56,619 --> 01:16:58,740
 

2205
01:16:58,749 --> 01:17:01,800
- Are you all right?.- She's fine.

2206
01:17:01,809 --> 01:17:01,910
 

2207
01:17:01,919 --> 01:17:05,350
Suddenly he goes,"I already sold the painting."

2208
01:17:05,359 --> 01:17:05,450
 

2209
01:17:05,459 --> 01:17:08,480
And he like.goes to the bedroom...

2210
01:17:08,489 --> 01:17:08,590
 

2211
01:17:08,599 --> 01:17:12,610
and he looks and he comes out and.he looks at her and he kind of just...

2212
01:17:12,619 --> 01:17:12,760
 

2213
01:17:12,769 --> 01:17:16,250
They know and then they hug.And it's so...

2214
01:17:16,259 --> 01:17:17,260
 

2215
01:17:17,269 --> 01:17:20,530
- That's a chick's movie.- I would say so.

2216
01:17:20,539 --> 01:17:20,630
 

2217
01:17:20,639 --> 01:17:23,960
What kind of a person would write.to someone they heard on the radio?

2218
01:17:23,969 --> 01:17:24,070
 

2219
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:27,130
I got hundreds of letters.from women all over the country.

2220
01:17:27,139 --> 01:17:27,240
 

2221
01:17:27,249 --> 01:17:28,640
Desperate women.

2222
01:17:28,649 --> 01:17:28,740
 

2223
01:17:28,749 --> 01:17:32,040
Just because someone is looking for.a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.

2224
01:17:32,049 --> 01:17:32,110
 

2225
01:17:32,119 --> 01:17:34,440
How about rapacious.and love-starved?

2226
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:34,540
 

2227
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:37,640
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist.than to find a husband after the age...

2228
01:17:37,649 --> 01:17:37,750
 

2229
01:17:37,759 --> 01:17:39,840
That is absolutely untrue.

2230
01:17:39,849 --> 01:17:39,950
 

2231
01:17:39,959 --> 01:17:42,150
Right, honey. Right.

2232
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:42,250
 

2233
01:17:42,259 --> 01:17:44,620
I'm not lookin' for.a mail-order bride.

2234
01:17:44,629 --> 01:17:44,760
 

2235
01:17:44,769 --> 01:17:48,710
I just want somebody that I can have a.decent conversation with over dinner...

2236
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:48,860
 

2237
01:17:48,869 --> 01:17:52,320
without it fallin' down.into weepy tears over some movie.

2238
01:17:52,329 --> 01:17:52,460
 

2239
01:17:52,469 --> 01:17:53,900
She's very emotional.

2240
01:17:53,909 --> 01:17:54,030
 

2241
01:17:54,039 --> 01:17:56,120
- But I cried at The Dirty Dozen.- Who didn't?

2242
01:17:56,129 --> 01:17:56,230
 

2243
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:59,670
Jim Brown is throwin' these.hand grenades down these air shafts...

2244
01:17:59,679 --> 01:17:59,770
 

2245
01:17:59,779 --> 01:18:02,930
and Richard Jaeckel and Lee Marvin.were sittin' on top of this...

2246
01:18:02,939 --> 01:18:03,040
 

2247
01:18:03,049 --> 01:18:05,800
armored personnel carrier,dressed up like Nazis.

2248
01:18:05,809 --> 01:18:05,880
 

2249
01:18:05,889 --> 01:18:09,040
They're waiting.Trini López...

2250
01:18:09,049 --> 01:18:10,380
 

2251
01:18:10,389 --> 01:18:13,750
He busted his neck when they were.parachuting down behind the Nazi lines.

2252
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:13,850
 

2253
01:18:13,859 --> 01:18:15,370
Stop it.

2254
01:18:15,379 --> 01:18:15,490
 

2255
01:18:15,499 --> 01:18:19,510
Richard Jaeckel had on this shiny helmet.'cause he was the M.P.

2256
01:18:19,519 --> 01:18:19,660
 

2257
01:18:19,669 --> 01:18:20,550
No more.

2258
01:18:20,559 --> 01:18:21,860
 

2259
01:18:21,869 --> 01:18:24,590
Oh, God, I love that movie.

2260
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:32,440
 

2261
01:18:32,449 --> 01:18:35,670
This is the best movie.I've ever seen in my life.

2262
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:35,770
 

2263
01:18:35,779 --> 01:18:37,470
What's so great about it?

2264
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:37,540
 

2265
01:18:37,549 --> 01:18:40,100
You have to find her.You have to go to her.

2266
01:18:40,109 --> 01:18:40,210
 

2267
01:18:40,219 --> 01:18:42,340
Do you know how much money it costs.to go to New York?

2268
01:18:42,349 --> 01:18:42,450
 

2269
01:18:42,459 --> 01:18:44,350
Nobody knows.

2270
01:18:44,359 --> 01:18:44,450
 

2271
01:18:44,459 --> 01:18:48,540
It changes practically every day.How much money do you have?

2272
01:18:48,549 --> 01:18:48,650
 

2273
01:18:48,659 --> 01:18:50,050
Eighty dollars.

2274
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:50,190
 

2275
01:18:50,199 --> 01:18:53,550
I have 42. That would.probably cover taxicabs.

2276
01:18:53,559 --> 01:18:53,660
 

2277
01:18:53,669 --> 01:18:55,090
How would I get there?

2278
01:18:55,099 --> 01:18:56,230
 

2279
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:58,660
Honey, I have to run.these tickets over to someone.

2280
01:18:58,669 --> 01:18:58,800
 

2281
01:18:58,809 --> 01:19:00,700
Can you keep an eye on things?

2282
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:00,800
 

2283
01:19:00,809 --> 01:19:02,860
Sure, Mom.

2284
01:19:02,869 --> 01:19:13,040
 

2285
01:19:13,049 --> 01:19:16,340
- Do you want a window seat or an aisle?.- Window.

2286
01:19:16,349 --> 01:19:16,450
 

2287
01:19:16,459 --> 01:19:18,710
- Do you want a fruit plate?.- I don't know. Do I?

2288
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:18,820
 

2289
01:19:18,829 --> 01:19:21,510
I'd rather die.than eat airplane food.

2290
01:19:21,519 --> 01:19:21,620
 

2291
01:19:21,629 --> 01:19:23,810
I'm telling them you're 12.so you can fly unaccompanied...

2292
01:19:23,819 --> 01:19:23,950
 

2293
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:25,920
and the stewardess.won't carry you around.

2294
01:19:25,929 --> 01:19:26,060
 

2295
01:19:26,069 --> 01:19:28,620
Are you crazy?.Who'd believe I'm 12?

2296
01:19:28,629 --> 01:19:28,760
 

2297
01:19:28,769 --> 01:19:31,660
If it's in the computer,they believe anything.

2298
01:19:31,669 --> 01:19:31,760
 

2299
01:19:31,769 --> 01:19:33,660
Are you sure?

2300
01:19:33,669 --> 01:19:33,760
 

2301
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:36,160
Do you want me to say that.you're really short for your age...

2302
01:19:36,169 --> 01:19:36,270
 

2303
01:19:36,279 --> 01:19:38,390
and that they shouldn't say anything.'cause it would hurt your feelings?

2304
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:38,500
 

2305
01:19:38,509 --> 01:19:40,800
Yeah, that's a great idea.

2306
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:40,900
 

2307
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:45,740
Sometimes it's hard to be

2308
01:19:45,749 --> 01:19:45,810
 

2309
01:19:45,819 --> 01:19:47,740
A woman

2310
01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:50,680
 

2311
01:19:50,689 --> 01:19:53,710
Givin' all your love

2312
01:19:53,719 --> 01:19:53,820
 

2313
01:19:53,829 --> 01:19:58,280
To just one man

2314
01:19:58,289 --> 01:19:58,420
 

2315
01:19:58,429 --> 01:19:59,650
Walter.

2316
01:19:59,659 --> 01:20:01,020
 

2317
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:04,760
- You're gonna miss the train.- No, I'm not.

2318
01:20:04,769 --> 01:20:04,860
 

2319
01:20:04,869 --> 01:20:08,490
I'm so happy, Becky.Finally I feel happy.

2320
01:20:08,499 --> 01:20:08,600
 

2321
01:20:08,609 --> 01:20:10,500
This is right. This is real.

2322
01:20:10,509 --> 01:20:10,600
 

2323
01:20:10,609 --> 01:20:13,300
Everything else is what happens.when you watch too many movies...

2324
01:20:13,309 --> 01:20:13,400
 

2325
01:20:13,409 --> 01:20:15,870
and you completely.lose sight of what counts.

2326
01:20:15,879 --> 01:20:15,970
 

2327
01:20:15,979 --> 01:20:18,200
Please, don't tell anybody.what happened.

2328
01:20:18,209 --> 01:20:18,280
 

2329
01:20:18,289 --> 01:20:20,840
I would be so absolutely mortified.if anyone knew...

2330
01:20:20,849 --> 01:20:20,940
 

2331
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:24,210
I did anything even.remotely close to what I've done.

2332
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:24,310
 

2333
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:27,280
- Thank you. Do you promise?.- I promise.

2334
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:27,380
 

2335
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:29,780
Sleepless in Seattle.is history.

2336
01:20:29,789 --> 01:20:29,890
 

2337
01:20:29,899 --> 01:20:33,950
He's hard to understand

2338
01:20:33,959 --> 01:20:36,230
 

2339
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:40,660
And if you love him

2340
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:40,800
 

2341
01:20:40,809 --> 01:20:45,290
Oh, be proud of him

2342
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:45,400
 

2343
01:20:45,409 --> 01:20:48,700
'Cause after all

2344
01:20:48,709 --> 01:20:48,810
 

2345
01:20:48,819 --> 01:20:51,570
He's just a man

2346
01:20:51,579 --> 01:20:54,780
 

2347
01:20:54,789 --> 01:20:57,680
Stand by your man

2348
01:20:57,689 --> 01:21:00,650
 

2349
01:21:00,659 --> 01:21:02,210
I was...

2350
01:21:02,219 --> 01:21:03,690
 

2351
01:21:03,699 --> 01:21:05,620
- Go ahead.- You go.

2352
01:21:05,629 --> 01:21:05,720
 

2353
01:21:05,729 --> 01:21:08,120
Okay. Well,I was just gonna say...

2354
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:08,230
 

2355
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:11,750
that ever since Christmas,you've been different...

2356
01:21:11,759 --> 01:21:11,900
 

2357
01:21:11,909 --> 01:21:14,420
kind of distracted, distant.

2358
01:21:14,429 --> 01:21:14,530
 

2359
01:21:14,539 --> 01:21:16,970
But now...

2360
01:21:16,979 --> 01:21:17,070
 

2361
01:21:17,079 --> 01:21:21,700
it feels as if you're coming back.from wherever you were.

2362
01:21:21,709 --> 01:21:21,810
 

2363
01:21:21,819 --> 01:21:23,360
I am.

2364
01:21:23,369 --> 01:21:25,280
 

2365
01:21:25,289 --> 01:21:27,800
I was just, uh...

2366
01:21:27,809 --> 01:21:27,910
 

2367
01:21:27,919 --> 01:21:32,040
I just got...I think I got nervous.

2368
01:21:32,049 --> 01:21:32,150
 

2369
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:34,310
But that's normal, right?

2370
01:21:34,319 --> 01:21:34,420
 

2371
01:21:34,429 --> 01:21:38,110
I mean, don't you ever.feel nervous about...

2372
01:21:38,119 --> 01:21:38,260
 

2373
01:21:38,269 --> 01:21:40,190
You know?

2374
01:21:40,199 --> 01:21:40,290
 

2375
01:21:40,299 --> 01:21:42,260
What?

2376
01:21:42,269 --> 01:21:42,390
 

2377
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:43,620
Forever.

2378
01:21:43,629 --> 01:21:53,440
 

2379
01:21:53,449 --> 01:21:56,670
I did, and you know what I think?

2380
01:21:56,679 --> 01:21:56,770
 

2381
01:21:56,779 --> 01:22:00,970
I think I thought.it was too perfect, you know?

2382
01:22:00,979 --> 01:22:01,040
 

2383
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:04,500
I started to wonder.if we were the human equivalent...

2384
01:22:04,509 --> 01:22:04,610
 

2385
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:06,710
of two rights making a wrong.

2386
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:06,820
 

2387
01:22:06,829 --> 01:22:08,720
You know what it was?

2388
01:22:08,729 --> 01:22:08,820
 

2389
01:22:08,829 --> 01:22:12,410
It was like kismet, but not,if you see what I mean.

2390
01:22:12,419 --> 01:22:14,020
 

2391
01:22:14,029 --> 01:22:15,420
You have to grow up.

2392
01:22:15,429 --> 01:22:15,530
 

2393
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:18,290
You just can't keep having.all these adolescent fantasies...

2394
01:22:18,299 --> 01:22:18,400
 

2395
01:22:18,409 --> 01:22:20,800
about how exciting.your life is gonna be.

2396
01:22:20,809 --> 01:22:20,900
 

2397
01:22:20,909 --> 01:22:23,530
Don't hate me,but I love this pattern.

2398
01:22:23,539 --> 01:22:23,630
 

2399
01:22:23,639 --> 01:22:25,620
- You couldn't.- I do.

2400
01:22:25,629 --> 01:22:25,740
 

2401
01:22:25,749 --> 01:22:28,530
This is just like.my grandmother's china.

2402
01:22:28,539 --> 01:22:28,640
 

2403
01:22:28,649 --> 01:22:31,070
How many place settings.should I put down?

2404
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:31,140
 

2405
01:22:31,149 --> 01:22:32,700
Ten.

2406
01:22:32,709 --> 01:22:35,410
 

2407
01:22:35,419 --> 01:22:38,250
Exactly. Eight is too few.

2408
01:22:38,259 --> 01:22:38,350
 

2409
01:22:38,359 --> 01:22:40,980
Twelve is too many.

2410
01:22:40,989 --> 01:23:06,540
 

2411
01:23:06,549 --> 01:23:08,440
It was my mother's.

2412
01:23:08,449 --> 01:23:10,450
 

2413
01:23:10,459 --> 01:23:12,680
I had them size it down.

2414
01:23:12,689 --> 01:23:14,120
 

2415
01:23:14,129 --> 01:23:16,180
She had really fat fingers.

2416
01:23:16,189 --> 01:23:18,760
 

2417
01:23:18,769 --> 01:23:20,380
It's so beautiful.

2418
01:23:20,389 --> 01:23:20,520
 

2419
01:23:20,529 --> 01:23:23,690
It's exactly what I would.pick out if I had...

2420
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:23,790
 

2421
01:23:23,799 --> 01:23:26,590
every ring in the whole world.to choose from.

2422
01:23:26,599 --> 01:23:29,270
 

2423
01:23:29,279 --> 01:23:30,730
You see what I mean?

2424
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:30,830
 

2425
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:34,330
There are people who would like.a relationship to be full of surprises.

2426
01:23:34,339 --> 01:23:34,440
 

2427
01:23:34,449 --> 01:23:36,770
But I am not one of those people.

2428
01:23:36,779 --> 01:23:36,870
 

2429
01:23:36,879 --> 01:23:39,070
No, sirree.

2430
01:23:39,079 --> 01:23:39,140
 

2431
01:23:39,149 --> 01:23:41,800
Surprises are highly overrated.

2432
01:23:41,809 --> 01:23:44,710
 

2433
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:47,810
I'm leavin' first thing in the morning,but I'm only gonna be gone one night.

2434
01:23:47,819 --> 01:23:47,920
 

2435
01:23:47,929 --> 01:23:50,010
Clarise is gonna be here,so you'll be able to see...

2436
01:23:50,019 --> 01:23:50,120
 

2437
01:23:50,129 --> 01:23:52,420
plenty of Geraldo.and Nightmare On Elm Street 12.

2438
01:23:52,429 --> 01:23:52,560
 

2439
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:54,820
- I will never know.- Are you going with her?

2440
01:23:54,829 --> 01:23:56,790
 

2441
01:23:56,799 --> 01:23:58,820
I'm going with Victoria, yes.

2442
01:23:58,829 --> 01:24:01,130
 

2443
01:24:01,139 --> 01:24:03,900
And don't try anything tricky.Understand?

2444
01:24:03,909 --> 01:24:07,000
 

2445
01:24:07,009 --> 01:24:10,030
Don't go rollin' in poison ivy.as soon as I leave the house...

2446
01:24:10,039 --> 01:24:10,110
 

2447
01:24:10,119 --> 01:24:13,510
or lock yourself in a closet or do.anything that makes you need stitches.

2448
01:24:13,519 --> 01:24:13,610
 

2449
01:24:13,619 --> 01:24:15,670
If your finger falls off,it's stayin' off.

2450
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:15,780
 

2451
01:24:15,789 --> 01:24:18,180
No one's gonna pack it on ice.and take you to the hospital...

2452
01:24:18,189 --> 01:24:18,280
 

2453
01:24:18,289 --> 01:24:21,410
so you can be.a breakthrough in laser surgery.

2454
01:24:21,419 --> 01:24:21,520
 

2455
01:24:21,529 --> 01:24:24,540
- Is this about that woman in Baltimore?.- Annie.

2456
01:24:24,549 --> 01:24:29,130

- I don't care what you do!.- Good! Fine!

2458
01:24:31,539 --> 01:24:31,630

2460
01:24:34,899 --> 01:24:35,000

1990s and nobody is getting laid.

2462
01:24:36,979 --> 01:24:37,070
 

2463
01:24:37,079 --> 01:24:39,700
I'm the only man in America.who is getting laid this weekend.

2464
01:24:39,709 --> 01:24:39,800
 

2465
01:24:39,809 --> 01:24:44,100
I haven't been laid that much.Six girls in college, maybe seven.

2466
01:24:44,109 --> 01:24:45,380
 

2467

- How long you been standin' there?.- Forever.

2468
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:48,410
 

2469

- What did you hear me just say?.- "Six girls in college, maybe seven."

2470
01:24:52,219 --> 01:24:52,320
 

2471
01:24:52,329 --> 01:24:55,010
Seven.Eight! Mary Kelly.

2472
01:24:55,019 --> 01:24:55,120
 

2473
01:24:55,129 --> 01:24:56,550
This is the one I like.

2474
01:24:56,559 --> 01:24:59,520
 

2475
01:24:59,529 --> 01:25:01,620
Jonah, the fact is...

2476
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:01,760
 

2477
01:25:01,769 --> 01:25:04,730
you're not gonna like any woman.because it isn't your mother.

2478
01:25:04,739 --> 01:25:04,860
 

2479
01:25:04,869 --> 01:25:06,390
How do you know?

2480
01:25:06,399 --> 01:25:06,530
 

2481
01:25:06,539 --> 01:25:09,970
- What's wrong with Annie?.- Oh, Jonah, shut up!

2482
01:25:09,979 --> 01:25:10,070
 

2483

Shut up?

2484
01:25:12,599 --> 01:25:12,700
 

2485
01:25:12,709 --> 01:25:16,100
Mom never said "shut up'' to me.Mom never yelled at me.

2486
01:25:16,109 --> 01:25:16,210
 

2487
01:25:16,219 --> 01:25:19,330
- The conversation is finished.- Why can't we go to New York?

2488
01:25:19,339 --> 01:25:19,410
 

2489
01:25:19,419 --> 01:25:22,140
There is no way.that we are going on a plane...

2490
01:25:22,149 --> 01:25:22,250
 

2491
01:25:22,259 --> 01:25:24,710
to meet some woman.who could be a crazy, sick lunatic.

2492
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:24,810
 

2493

You'll have to tell Oprah.

2504
01:25:46,839 --> 01:25:46,940
 

2505
01:25:46,949 --> 01:25:49,200
How your dad destroyed your life.'cause he had to go off...

2506
01:25:49,209 --> 01:25:49,310
 

2507

2508
01:25:52,809 --> 01:26:07,320

01:29:43,579 --> 01:29:43,670
 

2575
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:46,540

- He meant Dom Pérignon.- I got it.

2580
01:29:53,479 --> 01:29:57,090
 

2581
01:29:57,099 --> 01:29:59,280
Beautiful view, isn't it?

2583
01:29:59,429 --> 01:30:04,220
Walter, there's something.I have to tell you.

2584
01:30:04,229 --> 01:30:18,740
 

2585

2593
01:31:41,799 --> 01:31:45,990
So, he could be on top.of the Empire State Building now.

2594
01:31:45,999 --> 01:31:48,660
 

2595

2597

2599
01:31:57,379 --> 01:31:59,270
I can't do this.

2600
01:31:59,279 --> 01:32:01,010
 

2601
01:32:01,019 --> 01:32:03,600
Look, Annie...

2602
01:32:03,609 --> 01:32:03,710
 

2603

I love you,but let's leave that outta this.

2604
01:32:07,389 --> 01:32:08,680
 

2605
01:32:08,689 --> 01:32:11,550
I don't wanna be someone.that you're settling for.

2606
01:32:11,559 --> 01:32:11,690
 

2607
01:32:11,699 --> 01:32:15,520
I don't wanna be someone.that anyone settles for.

2608
01:32:15,529 --> 01:32:17,190
 

2609
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:19,090
Marriage is hard enough...

2610
01:32:19,099 --> 01:32:19,200
 

2611
01:32:19,209 --> 01:32:22,890
without bringing such.low expectations into it.

2612
01:32:22,899 --> 01:32:23,000
 

2613
01:32:23,009 --> 01:32:24,400
Isn't it?

2614
01:32:24,409 --> 01:32:25,330
 

2615
01:32:25,339 --> 01:32:27,770
Walter, I don't deserve you.

2616
01:32:27,779 --> 01:32:28,670
 

2617
01:32:28,679 --> 01:32:31,070
I wouldn't put it that way.

2618
01:32:31,079 --> 01:32:32,580
 

2619
01:32:32,589 --> 01:32:34,910
But, okay.

2620
01:32:34,919 --> 01:32:51,160
 

2621
01:32:51,169 --> 01:32:52,390
You okay?

2622
01:32:52,399 --> 01:32:53,360
 

2623
01:32:53,369 --> 01:32:55,130
Yeah.

2624
01:32:55,139 --> 01:33:00,440
 

2625
01:33:00,449 --> 01:33:02,430
- What?.- Look.

2626
01:33:02,439 --> 01:33:11,150
 

2627
01:33:11,159 --> 01:33:14,170
- It's a sign.- Who needed a sign?

2628
01:33:14,179 --> 01:33:17,590
 

2629
01:33:17,599 --> 01:33:19,250
I have to go.

2630
01:33:19,259 --> 01:33:54,290
 

2631
01:33:54,299 --> 01:33:58,590
What if something had happened to you?.What if I couldn't get to you?

2632
01:33:58,599 --> 01:33:58,690
 

2633
01:33:58,699 --> 01:34:01,460
I'm sorry.

2634
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:03,270
 

2635
01:34:03,279 --> 01:34:05,760
What would I have done?

2636
01:34:05,769 --> 01:34:05,870
 

2637
01:34:05,879 --> 01:34:09,130
You are my family.You're all I've got.

2638
01:34:09,139 --> 01:34:09,240
 

2639
01:34:09,249 --> 01:34:11,760
I thought she'd be here.I thought she'd come.

2640
01:34:11,769 --> 01:34:11,840
 

2641
01:34:11,849 --> 01:34:14,400
We're doin' okay, aren't we?.Aren't we all right?

2642
01:34:14,409 --> 01:34:14,510
 

2643
01:34:14,519 --> 01:34:17,340
- Have I done anything really stupid?.- No.

2644
01:34:17,349 --> 01:34:17,450
 

2645
01:34:17,459 --> 01:34:19,910
- Have I screwed it up for both of us?.- No.

2646
01:34:19,919 --> 01:35:13,670
 

2647
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:17,040
- Observation deck?.- Sorry, ma'am, but it's too late.

2648
01:35:17,049 --> 01:35:18,270
 

2649
01:35:18,279 --> 01:35:20,440
Please. I really need.to get up there.

2650
01:35:20,449 --> 01:35:20,540
 

2651
01:35:20,549 --> 01:35:22,940
We're closing up.No more runs tonight.

2652
01:35:22,949 --> 01:35:28,680
 

2653

2655
01:35:31,029 --> 01:35:34,550
Can I just take a look?.There's someone I was supposed to meet.

2656
01:35:34,559 --> 01:35:34,690
 

2657
01:35:34,699 --> 01:35:37,250
He's probably not there,but if I don't at least look...

2658
01:35:37,259 --> 01:35:37,390
 

2659
01:35:37,399 --> 01:35:39,790
I'll always wonder about it.

2660
01:35:39,799 --> 01:35:39,900
 

2661
01:35:39,909 --> 01:35:41,800

2665
01:35:44,279 --> 01:35:46,500

2666
01:35:46,509 --> 01:35:55,240
 

2667
01:35:55,249 --> 01:35:58,370
Maybe when we get home.we'll get a dog.

2668
01:35:58,379 --> 01:35:58,480
 

2669
01:35:58,489 --> 01:36:01,750
