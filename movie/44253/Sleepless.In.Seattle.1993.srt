1
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:42,099
Mommy got sick.

2
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,109
It happened just like that.

3
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,510
There was nothing anybody could do.

4
00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:50,582
It isn't fair.

5
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,651
There's no reason.

6
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:57,883
But if we start asking why,
we'll go crazy.

7
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:25,807
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one
of them. They're done. Ready to eat.

8
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,320
Do you know how to make juice?

9
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:36,026
Microwave. Five minutes.

10
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:55,371
Here.

11
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:57,949
My shrink. Call him.

12
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,326
"Loss of Spouse Support Group.

13
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:14,231
Chicago Cancer Family Network.

14
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,893
Parents Without Partners.
Partners Without Parents.

15
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:20,029
Hug Yourself. Hug a Friend.
Hug a Shrink. "

16
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:22,107
Or work. Work hard.

17
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:27,441
Work will save you. Work is the only
thing that will see you through this.

18
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:35,218
Don't mind him. He's just a guy
who's lost his wife.

19
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:45,859
What I think we really
need is a change.

20
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:50,095
Good idea. Take a couple of weeks off.
Get some sun. Take Jonah fishing.

21
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,907
No, a real change.

22
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:58,909
A new city.

23
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:03,607
Someplace where every time I go around
a corner I don't think of Maggie.

24
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,624
<i>Where you gonna go?</i>

25
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,189
I was thinking about Seattle.

26
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:24,998
Eventually, in a few months,
you'll start seeing women.

27
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:27,038
- You'll meet someone.
- Right.

28
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:29,699
Move on. Right.
That's what I'm gonna do.

29
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,607
And then in a few months, boom, I'll
be fine. I'll just grow a new heart.

30
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,873
- Sam, I'm sorry.
- She didn't mean that.

31
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:38,974
I know. Look,
it just doesn't happen twice.

32
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,819
<i>You must remember this</i>

33
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:45,823
<i>A kiss is still a kiss</i>

34
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:49,053
<i>A sigh is just a sigh</i>

35
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:56,891
<i>The fundamental things apply</i>

36
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,528
<i>As time goes by</i>

37
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,736
<i>And when two lovers woo</i>

38
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,679
<i>They still say, I love you</i>

39
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:12,751
<i>On that you can rely</i>

40
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:20,752
<i>No matter what the future brings</i>

41
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,590
<i>As time goes by</i>

42
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,827
<i>Moonlight and love songs</i>

43
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:33,734
<i>Never out of date</i>

44
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,307
<i>Hearts full of passion</i>

45
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,537
<i>Jealousy and hate</i>

46
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:41,943
<i>Woman needs man</i>

47
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,812
<i>And man must have his mate</i>

48
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:49,377
<i>That no one can deny</i>

49
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,521
<i>It's still the same old story</i>

50
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,527
<i>A fight for love and glory</i>

51
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,598
<i>A case of do or die</i>

52
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:07,470
<i>The world will
always welcome lovers</i>

53
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,276
<i>As time</i>

54
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:15,279
<i>Goes by</i>

55
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,690
The tall one with red hair
is your cousin Irene.

56
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:33,958
You'll recognize her by
the disappointed look on her face.

57
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:37,263
Who was married to Harold
who ran off with his secretary.

58
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,033
But came back because Irene threatened
to put the dog to sleep if he didn't.

59
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,541
Your brother Dennis
is a professor at Johns Hopkins.

60
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,471
He's married to Betsy.

61
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,880
The most competitive woman
in the world.

62
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,884
I don't see how
I'm gonna remember all this.

63
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,580
Oh, well, Walter, you will.

64
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:11,029
Your Uncle Milton
lost all of his money-

65
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:14,334
- And some other people's.
- In a pyramid scheme.

66
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,739
Don't mention the IRS
or the federal prison system.

67
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:21,540
Your mother's Barbara.
Your father's Cliff.

68
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:25,708
- My father has electric trains.
- Really?

69
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,912
Am I what they had in mind?

70
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:32,047
Oh, Walter,
they're gonna love you.

71
00:06:35,127 --> 00:06:36,560
<i>Everybody.</i>

72
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,130
Annie has an announcement.

73
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,563
Walter and I are engaged.

74
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,603
Thank you. Thank you.

75
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,108
Dad, Mom knew.

76
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:58,547
- I don't see a ring, Annie.
- I don't have a ring yet.

77
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,551
Congratulations.

78
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,649
Bless you. Bless you.

79
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:08,251
- Oh, my goodness.
- Are you all right?

80
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,329
- It's nothing.
- Maybe it's the flowers.

81
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,263
- We'll move them.
- No! Don't touch them!

82
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:16,766
I feel terrible,
sneezing at a time like this.

83
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,894
This is a very
important moment for me.

84
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:21,029
He's allergic to everything.
Don't worry about it.

85
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,200
Bees. I'm allergic to bees.

86
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,211
Harold is allergic
to every type of bee.

87
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:31,215
We always have to carry a hypodermic
of adrenaline wherever we go.

88
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,717
If he eats even
one tiny piece of a nut-

89
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:37,255
My head swells up like
a watermelon, and I drop dead.

90
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:40,018
It's the same
with Harold and bees.

91
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:44,585
Your mother and I had salmon at our
wedding. A wedding without cold salmon-

92
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,632
- I'm not allergic to salmon.
- Oh, he's not allergic to salmon.

93
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,258
I don't think,
but you never know.

94
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,930
- You never know.
- Harold wasn't always allergic to bees.

95
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:57,941
Honey, what a shame. We had
some champagne. What did we use it for?

96
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:00,273
- Uncle Milton's parole.
- And it was delicious.

97
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,040
It was, wasn't it, Milton?

98
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:04,138
When are you getting married?

99
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,481
- In early June, in the garden.
- Does it have to be in the garden?

100
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:11,215
- What a great idea.
- What about Harold and bees?

101
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:14,656
- I'm allergic to bees.
- We'll spray you.

102
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,560
Cold salmon, a lovely
cucumber salad, strawberries.

103
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:22,122
I'm afraid I am allergic
to strawberries.

104
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:24,395
Allergic to strawberries.

105
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:27,631
Is this all right
with you, Walter?

106
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,072
Today I consider myself
the luckiest...

107
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:33,906
m- m-man on the f-f-face
of the E-E-Earth.

108
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,278
The Lou Gehrig line.
Remember? Remember, Dad?

109
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,544
<i>- The Lou Gehrig line from-
- Pride of the Yankees.</i>

110
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,779
<i>- Pride of the Yankees!
- Pride of the Yankees.</i>

111
00:08:41,887 --> 00:08:45,288
- It's baseball.
- A historical reference.

112
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:50,192
I would like to propose a toast
to my kid sister.

113
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:53,026
To Walter and my baby.

114
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:56,033
To Walter and Annie.

115
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,604
Everyone, please eat
before it gets cold.

116
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,973
Here it is.

117
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:10,071
The historical society wanted this,
and I never would give it to them.

118
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,343
Oh, Mom!

119
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,079
I noticed these things
are back in fashion.

120
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:19,556
- Grandmother's dress.
- Oh, honey.

121
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:22,126
He's a lovely man, Annie.

122
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:27,255
I know. He is wonderful, isn't he?
And he's such a wonderful athlete.

123
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,493
- Are his folks nice?
- You'll love them.

124
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,469
We're going down to D.C. Tonight
to be with them Christmas morning.

125
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:36,735
- How did it happen?
- Well, it's silly, really.

126
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,743
I'd seen him at the office.
Obviously, I'd seen him.

127
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,745
He's the associate publisher.

128
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:45,681
One day we both ordered sandwiches
from the same place.

129
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:49,982
He got my lettuce and tomato on wheat,
which, of course, he was allergic to.

130
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,319
And I got his lettuce
and tomato on white.

131
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:54,790
- How amazing.
- It is, isn't it?

132
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:57,020
You make a million decisions
that mean nothing.

133
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,791
Then one day you order takeout,
and it changes your life.

134
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:01,991
Destiny takes a hand.

135
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,695
Mom, destiny is
something we've invented...

136
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:08,569
because we can't stand the fact that
everything that happens is accidental.

137
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:13,941
How do you explain that you both ordered
the same sandwich except for the bread?

138
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:17,413
How many people in this world
like lettuce and tomato...

139
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,417
without something else like tuna?

140
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,218
Well, it wasn't a sign.
It was a coincidence.

141
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:29,385
I was in Atlantic City with my family.
Cliff was a waiter.

142
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:34,194
He wasn't even supposed to work
that night, and suppose he hadn't?

143
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:38,030
He asked me to take a midnight walk
on the Steel Pier.

144
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:42,597
I've probably told you this
a million times, but I don't care.

145
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,108
Then he held my hand.

146
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,474
At one point I looked down
and I couldn't tell...

147
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:50,810
which fingers were his
and which were mine.

148
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,714
And I knew.

149
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,255
- What?
- You know.

150
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:00,689
- What?
- Magic.

151
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,421
It was magic.

152
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,019
Magic?

153
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,294
I knew we'd be together forever and
that everything would be wonderful...

154
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:12,131
just the way you feel about Walter.

155
00:11:12,237 --> 00:11:17,265
Walter? It's quite
a formal name, isn't it?

156
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:20,834
One of the things I truly knew
was that your father and I...

157
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,642
were going to have
a wonderful time in-

158
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:27,048
- The sack, I believe you call it.
- Mom!

159
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:29,416
Of course, it took
several years before everything...

160
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:31,421
worked like clockwork
in that department.

161
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:33,514
So don't be worried
if it takes a while.

162
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:37,061
- Well, we already-
- Fine. Fine. Fiddle-de-dee.

163
00:11:37,162 --> 00:11:40,188
- How's it working?
- Like clockwork.

164
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,491
Oh, honey.

165
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:50,269
- It's a sign.
- You don't believe in signs.

166
00:11:55,948 --> 00:12:00,544
They loved you! I told you they
would love you, and they loved you!

167
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:03,348
- I love you.
- I love you, Walter.

168
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:08,893
Did anyone ever call you
anything other than Walter?

169
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,292
Nope.

170
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:13,364
Not even when you were young?

171
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:15,695
Nope, not even when I was young.

172
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:19,528
You sure you don't
want to drive with me?

173
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,471
How will I get back
to Baltimore on Friday?

174
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:26,977
I forgot the present. I left your
stepmother's present inside by accident.

175
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,276
When we're old and gray, you're gonna
have to remind me to put my teeth in.

176
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:35,012
I'll be walking all over town, smacking
my gums together and not even noticing.

177
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,180
- I'll wait.
- You'll wait? Oh! Right.

178
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,350
Don't wait. It's silly.
Go ahead. We're late anyway.

179
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,621
I'll be ten minutes behind you.

180
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,989
<i>Sleigh bells jing-a-ling
Ring-ting-ting-a-ling too</i>

181
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,999
<i>Horses, horses, horses</i>

182
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,035
<i>It's lovely weather
for a sleigh ride together with you</i>

183
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:53,036
<i>Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap</i>

184
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:56,164
<i>The snow is falling
and friends are calling, Yoo-hoo</i>

185
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,438
<i>Friends are calling, Yoo-hoo
Ding-a-ling-a-ling</i>

186
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,173
<i>Horses, horses, horses
Horses, horses, horses</i>

187
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,839
<i>Horses, horses, horses</i>

188
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,578
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way</i>

189
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:11,747
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh</i>

190
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,825
<i>Jingle bells</i>

191
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,258
<i>- Horses, horses, horses
- Welcome to "You and Your Emotions. "</i>

192
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:18,295
<i>- Laughing all the way
- I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone...</i>

<i>broadcasting live across America from
the top of the Sears Tower in Chicago.</i>

194
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:27,001
<i>Tonight we're talking
about wishes and dreams.</i>

195
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:29,665
<i>- What's your wish this Christmas Eve?
- What's your wish?</i>

196
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:33,438
<i>- Maybe the best gift you can give your-
- My wish is to turn the radio station.</i>

197
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:37,379
<i>Subject of this evening's medical update
is "You and Your Spleen. "</i>

198
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:39,109
<i>- Your host is-
- Not on your life.</i>

199
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:43,814
<i>Coming up, "Jingle Bells" backwards,
sung by the New Jersey-</i>

200
00:13:43,922 --> 00:13:48,154
<i>- Seattle, go ahead.
- Hello, this is Jonah-</i>

201
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,818
<i>No last names, Jonah.</i>

202
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:53,227
<i>You sound younger than
our usual callers. How old are you?</i>

203
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,165
<i>- I'm eight.
- Eight. How come you're up so late?</i>

204
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:59,999
<i>- It's not that late in Seattle.
- Of course. You're absolutely right.</i>

205
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:02,300
<i>What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?</i>

206
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:06,343
<i>It's not for me. It's for my dad.
I think he needs a new wife.</i>

207
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,175
<i>- You don't like the one he has now?
- He doesn't have one now.</i>

208
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,839
<i>That's the problem.</i>

209
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:13,383
<i>- Where's your mom?
- She died.</i>

210
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:18,252
<i>- I'm so sorry to hear that.
- Well, who can believe this?</i>

211
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,349
<i>I've been pretty sad,
but I think my dad's worse.</i>

212
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,985
<i>Have you talked
to your dad about this?</i>

213
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,257
<i>- No.
- Why not?</i>

214
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,892
<i>- It's like it makes him sadder.
- I can understand that.</i>

215
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,562
<i>- Jonah, is your dad home right now?
- Yeah.</i>

216
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:36,300
<i>- What's he doing? Is he busy?
- Not really. He's out on the deck.</i>

217
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:40,606
<i>I'm sure that I can help, but I'm
going to need you to help me help him.</i>

218
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:42,805
<i>- Wretched woman!
- Bring your dad to the phone.</i>

219
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:46,442
<i>- Hang up, Jonah! Don't listen to her.
- No way. He'd kill me.</i>

220
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:49,076
<i>Trust me, Jonah.
He won't be angry...</i>

221
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:51,678
<i>when he realizes
how concerned you are about him.</i>

222
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,189
Wanna bet?

223
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,125
<i>If I get yelled at, I'm never
going to listen to your show again.</i>

224
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,492
<i>Fair enough.</i>

225
00:14:59,364 --> 00:15:02,128
- Dad?
- Yeah?

226
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,397
There's someone
on the phone for you.

227
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,500
<i>- His name's Sam.
- Sam.</i>

228
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,510
<i>If you've just tuned in,
this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone.</i>

229
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,637
<i>Tonight's topic is
"Your Wishes and Dreams. "</i>

230
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:19,478
<i>- I got it.
- We're on the line with Seattle.</i>

231
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:21,074
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, Sam.</i>

232
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,882
<i>This is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone
on Network America.</i>

233
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:29,324
What are you selling tonight?
Micro hibachis or Ginza knives?

234
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,659
<i>I'm not selling anything.
I just want to help.</i>

235
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:34,664
<i>I want you to know
that your son called...</i>

236
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:38,668
<i>and he asked me for advice
on how you might find a new wife.</i>

237
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:44,106
<i>- Who is this?
- Dr. Fieldstone of Network America.</i>

238
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,110
<i>- You are on the air.
- You called a radio station?</i>

239
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:51,945
<i>- Sam? Sam? Sam, are you with me?
- Yeah. Yes.</i>

240
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:56,248
<i>Your son feels that since your wife's
death you've been very, very unhappy.</i>

241
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:59,882
<i>He's genuinely worried about you.</i>

242
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,392
Oh, hey, get out here.
Get out here.

243
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,792
I'm not gonna
go through this alone.

244
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:08,923
<i>I think it's very hard for him
to talk to you about all this.</i>

245
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:12,731
<i>I thought maybe you and I could talk.
It would make Jonah feel better.</i>

246
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:16,296
<i>- Sam?
- Talk to her, Dad. She's a doctor.</i>

247
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,309
Of what?
Her first name could be Doctor.

248
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,902
<i>- Please?
- Sam?</i>

249
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:25,506
<i>Sam, it's his Christmas wish.</i>

250
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:29,382
<i>- Okay.
- Okay, good.</i>

251
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,979
<i>I know this is difficult.</i>

252
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,082
<i>But how long ago
did your wife die?</i>

253
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:37,655
About a year and a half ago.

254
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,789
<i>Have you had
any relationships since?</i>

255
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:44,958
<i>- Nope.
- No?</i>

256
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,833
<i>Why not?</i>

257
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,632
Marcia- Or should
I call you Dr. Fieldstone?

258
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:54,211
<i>- Dr. Marcia.
- Dr. Marcia.</i>

259
00:16:54,312 --> 00:16:58,646
<i>- I don't mean to be rude.
- I don't want to invade your privacy.</i>

260
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,048
<i>- Oh, sure you do.
- Sure you do.</i>

261
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:04,418
<i>Go on, Sam.
I'm listening.</i>

262
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,354
<i>Sam?</i>

263
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:11,920
We had a pretty
tough time there at first.

264
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,624
But we're dealing with it.

265
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:19,693
And Jonah and I will
get along just fine again...

266
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,831
as soon as I break his radio.

267
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:27,334
<i>I have no doubt that
you're a wonderful father.</i>

268
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:31,177
<i>- You can tell a lot from a voice.
- You certainly can.</i>

269
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:35,913
<i>But something must be missing if
Jonah still feels you're under a cloud.</i>

270
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:39,320
<i>Just a few questions.
Are you sleeping at night?</i>

271
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:42,484
- He doesn't sleep at all.
- How do you know that?

272
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,323
I live here.

273
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:51,402
Look, it's Christmas.

274
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:58,800
Maggie, my wife-

275
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,378
She really did it.

276
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,380
I mean, she loved-

277
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,907
She made everything beautiful.

278
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,883
<i>And it's just tough
this time of year.</i>

279
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,652
Any kid needs a mother.

280
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:19,526
<i>Could it be that you need someone
just as much as Jonah does?</i>

281
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,799
Yes.

282
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:27,235
<i>Don't answer that. Let's get into that
right after these messages.</i>

283
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,569
<i>Sam, Jonah, don't go away.</i>

284
00:18:29,674 --> 00:18:33,940
<i>If you've just tuned in,
we're talking to Sleepless in Seattle.</i>

285
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:38,106
<i>We'll be right back after this break
with your listener response.</i>

286
00:18:38,216 --> 00:18:40,013
What's she talking about?

287
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:43,178
This is when other people get to call in
and dump on what you said.

288
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:48,783
Oh, oh. This is really fun,
and helpful.

289
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,994
I'll bet he's tall
with a cute butt.

290
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,434
Bet he hasn't bathed in weeks
and he stinks.

291
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,870
Harriet, shut up.
Hi. Can I help you?

292
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:03,702
Tea with the bag out.

293
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:07,744
Maybe I'll hustle myself out to Seattle.
Give him a gift for New Year's Eve.

294
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:11,145
You go on out there if you want to,
but don't open his refrigerator.

295
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:14,116
They don't cover anything
when they put it in the fridge.

296
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,710
They just stick it in there and
leave it till it walks out by itself.

297
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:20,313
What I'm saying is, I wouldn't kick this
guy out of my bed for eating crackers.

298
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,325
You know what I'm saying?
Sixty-five cents.

299
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:26,056
<i>Let's take a call
before we get back to Sleepless.</i>

300
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:29,258
<i>Knoxville, Tennessee,
you're on the air. Talk to me.</i>

301
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:34,066
<i>Yes, I would just like to know
where I could get this man's address.</i>

302
00:19:34,172 --> 00:19:36,333
<i>- Honey, get in line.
- We don't give that information.</i>

303
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,068
<i>Next caller, go ahead.</i>

304
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,671
<i>If there was one question
I was allowed to ask-</i>

305
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,976
Oh, go ahead.

306
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:49,144
<i>People who truly loved once
are far more likely to love again.</i>

307
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:53,623
<i>Do you think there's someone out there
you could love as much as your wife?</i>

308
00:19:56,394 --> 00:20:00,558
<i>Well, Dr. Marcia Fieldstone,
that's hard to imagine.</i>

309
00:20:00,665 --> 00:20:03,998
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

310
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:09,096
Well, I'm going to get
out of bed every morning...

311
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:11,437
breathe in and out all day long.

312
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:16,378
<i>Then after a while
I won't have to remind myself...</i>

313
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:20,611
<i>to get out of bed in the morning
and breathe in and out.</i>

314
00:20:21,953 --> 00:20:26,549
And then after a while
I won't have to think about how...

315
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:29,786
I had it great and perfect
for a while.

316
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:34,627
<i>Sam, tell me what was
so special about your wife?</i>

317
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,293
<i>Well, how long is your program?</i>

318
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:42,866
<i>Oh, well, it was a-</i>

319
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:44,874
<i>It was a million
tiny little things.</i>

320
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:50,004
<i>When you added them all up, it just
meant we were supposed to be together.</i>

321
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:54,211
<i>And I knew it. I knew it
the very first time I touched her.</i>

322
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,254
It was like coming home...

323
00:20:57,355 --> 00:21:00,483
only to no home I'd ever known.

324
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,584
I was just taking her hand...

325
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:06,994
to help her out of a car...

326
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:08,588
and I knew it.

327
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,267
<i>It was like-</i>

328
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,930
<i>- Magic.
- Magic.</i>

329
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,635
<i>Well, folks,
it's time to wrap it up.</i>

330
00:21:18,743 --> 00:21:21,337
<i>I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone
in Chicago.</i>

331
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:25,906
<i>And to all my listeners,
a magical and merry Christmas.</i>

332
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:30,920
<i>And to you, Sleepless in Seattle,
we hope you'll call again soon.</i>

333
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:34,219
<i>- Let us know how it's going.
- Oh, you can count on it.</i>

334
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:39,889
<i>When you find me</i>

335
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:44,560
<i>I know somewhere</i>

336
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:50,107
<i>Over the rainbow</i>

337
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:56,746
<i>The bluebirds glide</i>

338
00:22:00,785 --> 00:22:04,653
<i>Birds fly</i>

339
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:09,056
<i>Over the rainbow</i>

340
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,393
<i>Why, then, oh, why</i>

341
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:18,799
<i>Can't I</i>

342
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,078
This man sells the greatest soup
you've ever eaten...

343
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:29,305
and he is the meanest man
in America.

344
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:33,009
I feel very strongly about this, Becky.
It's not just about the soup.

345
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,211
- Do it. What else?
- New Year's Eve.

346
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,754
<i>- Please don't make me write it.
- Listen to this.</i>

347
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,950
"Phone service in the greater Chicago
area was tied up for two hours...

348
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,527
Christmas Eve when some kid
calls a phone-in radio show...

349
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,528
and says that his dad
needs a new wife.

350
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:50,033
Two thousand women called the station
asking for the guy's number. "

351
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:53,366
I heard it. This kid calls up
and says, "My dad needs a wife. "

352
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:57,032
This shrink forces the guy to the phone
and says, "You want to talk about it?"

353
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,633
He says, "No,
as a matter of fact, I don't. "

354
00:22:59,744 --> 00:23:02,770
Suddenly, for no reason at all, he talks
about how much he loved his wife...

355
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,849
and how he just
fell in love with her...

356
00:23:04,949 --> 00:23:06,883
like he was one
of those cows in Michigan.

357
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:10,045
<i>- What cows in Michigan?
- It was on 60 Minutes.</i>

358
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,282
There were those cows
that got zapped by stray voltage.

359
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,018
No one knows why.
Maybe it was Wisconsin.

360
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:19,392
But anyway, I was listening to him
talk about how much he loved his wife...

361
00:23:19,497 --> 00:23:21,897
and suddenly I was crying.

362
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,230
It's like what happens when
I watch those phone company ads.

363
00:23:24,335 --> 00:23:26,326
I don't have to see the whole thing,
just the part where...

364
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:29,373
the daughter gives the mother the
refrigerator with the big red bow on it.

365
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:33,570
<i>The Polaroid commercial. Two 5-year-olds
at their grandfather's birthday party.</i>

366
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,578
- They're making the album.
- With the glue.

367
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,342
That kills me.

368
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,850
You should write
something about this.

369
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:43,443
- About what?
- Whatever it is.

370
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:47,286
I'll tell you. Two thousand women
calling a radio station for a husband.

371
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:49,292
There are a lot of desperate women
out there lookin' for love.

372
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,294
Especially over a certain age.

373
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:54,593
It's easier to be killed by a terrorist
than get married over the age of 40.

374
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,599
That is not true.
That statistic is not true.

375
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,828
That's right. It's not true.
But it feels true.

376
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,837
It feels true
because it is true.

377
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,567
There's practically a whole book
about how that's not true.

378
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:06,667
- Calm down. You brought it up.
- I did not, Wyatt.

379
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,941
- Did you even read that book?
- Did anyone read it all the way through?

380
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:13,108
Are you two finished?
Fine. Now where were we?

381
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:17,348
If someone is a widower,
why do they say that he was widowed?

382
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:20,185
Why don't they say
he was widowered?

383
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,795
I was just wondering.

384
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,864
What was that about up there?

385
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,832
- What was what?
- What's with you?

386
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:33,700
<i>- Nothing's with me.
- Something's with you.</i>

387
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:37,263
- What are you saying?
- Whatever it is, you can tell me.

388
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,842
Sleepless in Seattle?

389
00:24:38,943 --> 00:24:41,571
That's what she called him on the show
because he can't sleep.

390
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,739
And now 2,000 women
want his number.

391
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:47,249
The guy could be a crackhead,
a transvestite...

392
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:50,583
a flasher, a junkie,
a chain-saw murderer...

393
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:53,782
or someone really sick,
someone like my Rick.

394
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,561
- Actually, he sounded nice.
- Oh?

395
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:03,996
Oh, really?
Now we're getting down to it.

396
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:07,003
Please. Becky,
I'm madly in love with Walter.

397
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:10,268
He did the craziest thing
the other night. What was that?

398
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:16,276
Oh, it was so funny.
We were hysterical. What was that?

399
00:25:27,725 --> 00:25:33,129
You know, I've got to go to Boston
for the convention, right?

400
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:36,428
Then I got to visit Winston-Hughes
about switching over our computers.

401
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:41,972
<i>But why don't we meet in New York
for Valentine's Day weekend?</i>

402
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:45,167
Walter, I'd love to!

403
00:25:45,276 --> 00:25:47,938
We can stay at the Plaza.

404
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,412
Ice-stake in Central Park.

405
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,745
Register.

406
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,545
Register?

407
00:25:54,652 --> 00:25:59,248
You know, for dishes,
glasses, silver, everything.

408
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,225
How about it?

409
00:26:06,497 --> 00:26:09,364
I'll take you to Chinatown
for dim sum.

410
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:12,402
- Does it have wheat in it?
- I don't think so.

411
00:26:15,873 --> 00:26:18,899
<i>Dim sum, dim sum</i>

412
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:25,739
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...</i>

413
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:30,150
five, four, three, two, one!

414
00:26:30,254 --> 00:26:34,850
Hey, Jonah. Wake up. Wake up, man.
The ball's droppin'.

415
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,483
<i>Happy new year!</i>

416
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:46,329
<i>Okay, pal. I got ya.</i>

417
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:47,665
It's okay.

418
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,763
There we go.

419
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,500
Happy new year.

420
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,578
Happy new year.

421
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:33,080
Kiss Howard.

422
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,243
Good night, Howard.

423
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,767
<i>Sometimes I wonder</i>

424
00:27:54,872 --> 00:27:58,000
<i>Why I spend</i>

425
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:02,409
<i>The lonely night</i>

426
00:28:02,513 --> 00:28:05,971
<i>Dreaming of a song</i>

427
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,644
<i>The melody</i>

428
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:12,314
<i>Haunts my reverie</i>

429
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:17,622
<i>And I am once again with you</i>

430
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:21,256
<i>When our love was new</i>

431
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:27,037
<i>And each kiss an inspiration</i>

432
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:34,204
<i>But that was long ago</i>

433
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:38,214
<i>Now my consolation</i>

434
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:43,185
<i>Is in the stardust of a song</i>

435
00:28:43,287 --> 00:28:48,850
<i>Beside the garden wall</i>

436
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,260
<i>When stars are bright</i>

437
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:56,856
<i>You are in my arms</i>

438
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,835
<i>The nightingale</i>

439
00:28:59,937 --> 00:29:03,270
<i>Tells his fairy tale</i>

440
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:07,333
<i>Of paradise where roses bloom</i>

441
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,504
Can I have half your beer?

442
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,776
Sure. Go ahead.

443
00:29:15,052 --> 00:29:18,044
What did I used to say?

444
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,283
"Here's looking at you"?

445
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,291
"Here's mud in your eye"?

446
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,691
"Here's to us. "

447
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:29,094
You used to say, "Here's to us. "

448
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,936
Oh, babe.
I miss you so much it hurts.

449
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:56,449
- What do you want to do?
- We'll tell him when he gets here.

450
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,791
You want to tell him.
I don't mind telling him.

451
00:29:58,896 --> 00:30:01,592
- She's here.
- She's back. She has another idea.

452
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,633
I don't need-
Claire, how are you?

453
00:30:03,734 --> 00:30:06,328
I'm so glad you're here.
I heard you on the radio.

454
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:09,929
- I told everyone about it.
- We already knew.

455
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,269
- How did you-
- Grace.

456
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:13,502
The dispatcher?
All of Seattle knows.

457
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:16,011
I was brushing my teeth
and suddenly there you were.

458
00:30:16,113 --> 00:30:19,173
I couldn't believe my ears.
I called my mother in Las Vegas.

459
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:24,084
I said, "Mother, turn on the radio.
That's my architect. "

460
00:30:24,188 --> 00:30:26,986
It is so nice...

461
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:30,458
when a man
can express his feelings.

462
00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:33,428
<i>- It's wonderful.
- I wish I could express my feelings.</i>

463
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:38,730
- So, Claire, is there a problem?
- I was tossing and turning last night.

464
00:30:38,836 --> 00:30:44,103
I realized I'm never going to fit my
platters in the refrigerator we ordered.

465
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:46,574
When I give parties,
I always put in platters.

466
00:30:46,677 --> 00:30:50,010
So I thought I would get the Sub-Zero
refrigerator instead. The only problem-

467
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,014
We have to redo all the cabinets.

468
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:55,483
- We'll be into this wall.
- That's a bearing wall.

469
00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:57,884
That's a delay, Claire, of-

470
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,889
- Two, three-
- Five, six-

471
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,925
- Twelve weeks.
- I don't mind.

472
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,494
The important thing
is to get it right.

473
00:31:04,595 --> 00:31:06,529
- Absolutely.
- Your words.

474
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,327
<i>I've got to rush.
La d¨¦corateur calls.</i>

475
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:11,594
- Bye!
- Bye-bye.

476
00:31:15,172 --> 00:31:17,470
Well, this is fate.
She's divorced.

477
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:19,702
We don't want to redo the cabinets,
and you need a wife.

478
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:22,438
What do they call that
when everything intersects?

479
00:31:22,546 --> 00:31:24,480
The Bermuda Triangle.

480
00:31:34,191 --> 00:31:37,752
And here's another one.
You got room for one more here?

481
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:39,830
There you go.
You all right there?

482
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:43,867
<i>- Look at this, Dad. They're all for you.
- Yes, sir. There you go.</i>

483
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,933
"Sleepless in Seattle.
In care of Dr. Marcia Fieldstone"?

484
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:54,740
If you have trouble sleeping, drink
a glass of water from the other side.

485
00:31:54,845 --> 00:31:57,313
- I thought that was for hiccups.
- Does it work for hiccups?

486
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:01,078
For hiccups, take a spoonful of sugar
and hold it in your mouth for a minute.

487
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:05,019
- Really?
- Thank you.

488
00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:07,386
What possessed you
to give them our address?

489
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:10,551
They called and asked for it.

490
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:12,788
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle...

491
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:16,663
You're the most attractive man
I ever laid ears on. "

492
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:20,396
Wait, wait, wait. They called?
How did they get our number?

493
00:32:20,504 --> 00:32:22,563
Let me guess.
You gave it to them.

494
00:32:22,673 --> 00:32:25,699
You have to give them your phone number,
or they won't let you on the air.

495
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,677
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle,
I live in Tulsa. "

496
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:32,215
<i>- Where's that?
- It's in Oklahoma.</i>

497
00:32:32,316 --> 00:32:35,012
- Do you know where Oklahoma is?
- Somewhere in the middle.

498
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,316
I'm not even gonna think about
what they're not teaching you in school.

499
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:40,856
Yeah, it's somewhere
in the middle.

500
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:46,055
Generally speaking, we should rule out
anyone that doesn't live near here.

501
00:32:46,163 --> 00:32:47,926
She's willing to fly anywhere.

502
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:53,235
<i>She looks like my third grade teacher.
I hated my third grade teacher.</i>

503
00:32:53,337 --> 00:32:57,364
Wait a minute.
She is my third grade teacher!

504
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:02,208
- Aren't you gonna read any of these?
- This is not how it's done.

505
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,612
I'd much rather
just see somebody I like...

506
00:33:05,716 --> 00:33:09,015
and get a feeling about them...

507
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,247
and ask them
if they want to have a drink.

508
00:33:11,355 --> 00:33:13,255
- Or a slice of pizza?
- Not dinner.

509
00:33:13,357 --> 00:33:15,450
Not necessarily on the first date.

510
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:17,959
Halfway through dinner you could be
really sorry you asked them to dinner.

511
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:20,030
Whereas, if it's just a drink...

512
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,622
if you like them,
you could always ask them to dinner.

513
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:25,258
But if not, you can just say,
"Well, that was great. "

514
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:29,829
And then you go home.
See what I mean?

515
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,101
I wonder if
it still works this way.

516
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:36,475
- It doesn't. They ask you.
- I'm starting to notice that.

517
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:41,142
<i>If you get a new wife, I guess
you'll have sex with her, huh?</i>

518
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:43,720
I certainly hope so.

519
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:48,224
- Will she scratch up your back?
- What?

520
00:33:48,325 --> 00:33:53,058
In movies, women are always scratching
up the man's back and screaming.

521
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:56,031
- How do you know this?
- Jed's got cable.

522
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:58,294
Oh, Jed's got cable.

523
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,867
Hand me that towel
behind you, please.

524
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,513
- Thank you.
- I need it too.

525
00:34:09,613 --> 00:34:13,310
Here. Let me get you.
Jed's got cable.

526
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:15,977
<i>Another bride</i>

527
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,681
<i>Another groom</i>

528
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:24,159
<i>Another sunny honeymoon</i>

529
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:26,991
<i>Another season</i>

530
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:31,694
<i>And that's the reason
for makin' whoopee</i>

531
00:34:46,817 --> 00:34:51,720
<i>When the sun is high
in the afternoon sky</i>

532
00:34:51,822 --> 00:34:56,156
<i>You can always
find something to do</i>

533
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:02,130
<i>But from dusk till dawn
as the clock ticks on</i>

534
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:08,968
<i>Something happens to you</i>

535
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:13,567
<i>In the wee small hours</i>

536
00:35:13,677 --> 00:35:17,272
<i>Of the morning</i>

537
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:21,010
<i>While the whole wide world</i>

538
00:35:21,118 --> 00:35:25,179
<i>Is fast asleep</i>

539
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:29,089
<i>You lie awake</i>

540
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:33,186
<i>And think about the boy</i>

541
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,095
<i>And never ever think</i>

542
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,365
<i>Of counting sheep</i>

543
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,963
<i>Welcome back to
the "Best of Dr. Marcia Fieldstone"...</i>

544
00:35:44,074 --> 00:35:46,804
<i>clinical psychologist
and the friend you never had.</i>

545
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:50,904
<i>- Remember Marooned in Miami?
- He says he doesn't love me anymore.</i>

546
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:53,916
<i>Why would you want to be
with someone who doesn't love you?</i>

547
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:55,986
<i>Disappointed in Denver.</i>

548
00:35:56,086 --> 00:36:00,147
<i>Every time I come close to orgasm,
he goes to make himself a sandwich.</i>

549
00:36:00,257 --> 00:36:02,350
<i>Why don't you make him
a sandwich beforehand?</i>

550
00:36:02,459 --> 00:36:04,359
<i>Sleepless in Seattle.</i>

551
00:36:04,461 --> 00:36:09,797
<i>Well, I'm going to get
out of bed every morning...</i>

552
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,666
<i>and breathe in and out all day long.</i>

553
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:18,105
<i>Then after a while
I won't have to remind myself...</i>

554
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:22,942
<i>to get out of bed in the morning
and breathe in and out.</i>

555
00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:29,918
<i>And then after a while
I won't have to think about how...</i>

556
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:33,956
<i>I had it great and perfect
for a while.</i>

557
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:38,722
<i>Sam, tell me what was
so special about your wife?</i>

558
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,764
<i>Well, how long is your program?</i>

559
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:47,097
<i>Oh, well, it was a-</i>

560
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:49,138
<i>It was a million
tiny little things.</i>

561
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:54,177
<i>When you added them all up, it just
meant we were supposed to be together.</i>

562
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:58,908
<i>And I knew it. I knew it
the very first time I touched her.</i>

563
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,348
<i>It was like coming home...</i>

564
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:04,615
<i>only to no home I'd ever known.</i>

565
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,714
<i>I was just taking her hand...</i>

566
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:10,487
<i>to help her out of a car...</i>

567
00:37:11,595 --> 00:37:13,790
<i>and I knew it.</i>

568
00:37:13,897 --> 00:37:16,559
<i>It was like...</i>

569
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,567
<i>magic.</i>

570
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:43,958
<i>I think I'm going crazy, Dennis.
Are you happily married?</i>

571
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:46,996
- What?
- I mean, why did you get married?

572
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:49,429
Was it all trumpets
and fireworks?

573
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:52,661
I got married because Betsy said
we had to break up or get married...

574
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,431
so we got married.

575
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,931
But when you first met her...

576
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,532
did you believe
she was the only person for you?

577
00:37:59,643 --> 00:38:02,771
That in some mystical,
cosmic way it was fated?

578
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,714
Annie, when you're
attracted to someone...

579
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:09,684
it just means that your subconscious
is attracted to their subconscious...

580
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,618
subconsciously.

581
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:15,419
<i>What we think of as fate is two neuroses
knowing they're a perfect match.</i>

582
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,761
I don't even know him.

583
00:38:18,862 --> 00:38:23,663
I am having all of these fantasies
about some man I have never even met...

584
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:25,758
who lives in Seattle!

585
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:27,928
It rains nine months
of the year in Seattle.

586
00:38:28,038 --> 00:38:32,975
I know! I know!
I do not want to move to Seattle.

587
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:39,338
But what I really don't want
to do is end up always wondering...

588
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,715
what might have happened
and knowing I could have done something.

589
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,015
What do you think?

590
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:47,022
It's just cold feet, isn't it?

591
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:50,150
Everybody panics before
they get married. Didn't you?

592
00:38:51,061 --> 00:38:52,892
- I did.
- You did.

593
00:38:52,996 --> 00:38:56,329
Thank you very much, Dennis. I feel so
much better just having blown this off.

594
00:38:56,433 --> 00:38:57,730
Anytime.

595
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:01,669
Sandy has a girlfriend, Glenda.
She's a weight lifter.

596
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:03,763
It's not like her neck
is bigger than her head.

597
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:07,867
I'm not asking you to set me up.
I don't need your help with that.

598
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:11,038
I just want to know
what it's like out there.

599
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:13,639
That's what I'm trying to tell you,
what women are lookin' for.

600
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,219
Pecs and a cute butt.

601
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,914
<i>- Like, "He has the cutest butt"?
- Yeah.</i>

602
00:39:19,022 --> 00:39:21,855
- Where did I hear that recently?
- Everywhere.

603
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:24,587
You can't even turn on the news
nowadays without hearing about...

604
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,562
how some babe thought
some guy's butt was cute.

605
00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:31,100
Who the first woman to say this was,
I don't know. But it caught on.

606
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:33,328
So how's my butt?

607
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:37,903
- Not bad.
- Really?

608
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,976
- Is it cute though?
- I don't know.

609
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,045
Are we grading on a curve?

610
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,637
When's the last time
you were out there?

611
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,820
Jimmy Carter, 1978.

612
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,188
Things are
a little different now.

613
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:58,659
First you have to be friends.
You have to like each other.

614
00:39:58,762 --> 00:40:02,596
Then you neck.
This could go on for years.

615
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:05,259
Then you have tests.
Then you get to do it with a condom.

616
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:07,496
The good news is,
you split the check.

617
00:40:08,505 --> 00:40:11,065
I don't think I could
let a woman pay for dinner.

618
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,541
Great. They'll throw
a parade in your honor.

619
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:18,104
<i>You'll be man of the year
in Seattle magazine.</i>

620
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,046
Tiramisu.

621
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,017
- What is tiramisu?
- You'll find out.

622
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,747
- What is it?
- You'll see.

623
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:27,722
Some woman will want me to do it to her.
I'm not going to know what it is.

624
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,224
<i>You'll love it.</i>

625
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:32,821
This is going to be tough.
Tough, tough.

626
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,989
This is going to be much tougher
than I thought it was going to be.

627
00:40:35,098 --> 00:40:38,431
How about that decorator
on the Bennett job?

628
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:41,936
- Victoria?
- Yeah, she's perk.

629
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,132
- No, I don't-
- Come on!

630
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:45,868
I'm far away from that.

631
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:48,274
- I'm just assembling notes.
- Notes.

632
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:51,006
- How would I do that?
- What do you mean? Call her up.

633
00:40:51,114 --> 00:40:53,139
You say, "Let's get together.
We'll look at swatches. "

634
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,048
Call her on the phone?
Say, "Let's look at swatches"?

635
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:58,917
- Color schemes.
- She's not gonna see through that?

636
00:40:59,022 --> 00:41:01,923
You don't do it like I do it.
You do it in your own suave way.

637
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:04,653
Think Cary Grant.

638
00:41:04,761 --> 00:41:08,891
Cary Grant would say,
"Come look at my swatches"?

639
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:12,298
Maybe he did. I know
he didn't do it in the movies.

640
00:41:12,402 --> 00:41:13,926
<i>Gunga Din?</i>

641
00:41:14,037 --> 00:41:16,301
<i>Gunga Din is not
a swatch kind of movie.</i>

642
00:41:16,406 --> 00:41:18,840
Who knows what
he did in real life?

643
00:41:18,942 --> 00:41:21,809
But he did that
with Dyan Cannon?

644
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,403
"Hello, Dyan.
Take a look at these swatches. "

645
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:45,532
Jonah, I'm home.

646
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:49,938
Hey, Jonah!

647
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,449
Hi, Dad. This is Jessica.

648
00:42:13,096 --> 00:42:15,621
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Jessica.

649
00:42:15,732 --> 00:42:19,759
<i>Dad, this is amazing. If you play this
backwards, it says, "Paul is dead. "</i>

650
00:42:20,904 --> 00:42:23,168
Yeah, I know.

651
00:42:23,273 --> 00:42:25,002
How do you know?

652
00:42:27,377 --> 00:42:29,868
Dad, could you shut the door?

653
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,141
Sure. Sure.

654
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:33,876
H and G.

655
00:42:35,485 --> 00:42:38,010
Hi and good-bye.

656
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:27,466
<i>I'm back in the saddle again</i>

657
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:31,302
<i>Out where a friend is a friend</i>

658
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:36,004
<i>Where the longhorn cattle feed
on the lowly jimsonweed</i>

659
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:40,106
<i>Back in the saddle again</i>

660
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:44,415
<i>Ridin' the range once more</i>

661
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:48,389
<i>Totin' my old. 44</i>

662
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:50,653
<i>Where you sleep out every night</i>

663
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:54,026
Hello, Victoria?

664
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:58,158
This is Sam Baldwin.
I don't know if you remember me, but-

665
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:02,096
Oh, great. Hi.

666
00:44:02,205 --> 00:44:06,232
I was wondering if-

667
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:10,439
if you would like
to have a drink with me?

668
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:11,946
Dinner?

669
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:16,949
Dinner would be even better.

670
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:20,546
Friday would be great.
Yeah. How-

671
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:23,091
I hear that's a good place.

672
00:44:24,594 --> 00:44:30,328
How- 7:30 would be fine.
And I'Il-

673
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:35,500
Okay, I'll meet you there. Okay.

674
00:44:35,605 --> 00:44:39,200
So it's Friday...

675
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:41,573
at 7:30 for dinner.

676
00:44:41,678 --> 00:44:43,077
Great.

677
00:44:44,681 --> 00:44:46,239
Me too. Bye.

678
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:51,286
<i>Back in the saddle again</i>

679
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,586
<i>Are you in love with him?</i>

680
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,992
<i>I'm not now.</i>

681
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:04,925
Now those were the days
when people knew how to be in love.

682
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,128
- You're a basket case.
- They knew it.

683
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:12,436
Time, distance, nothing could separate
them, because they knew it was right.

684
00:45:12,542 --> 00:45:15,568
- It was real. It was-
- A movie.

685
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:17,579
That's your problem.
You don't want to be in love.

686
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:19,808
You want to be
in love in a movie.

687
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:21,474
Read it to me.

688
00:45:23,286 --> 00:45:27,313
"Dear Sleepless and Son, I have never
written a letter like this in my life. "

689
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:30,882
That's what everyone writes at
the beginning of letters to strangers.

690
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:34,259
I know that.
You think I don't know that?

691
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:37,094
What about Walter?

692
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,159
Walter. Oh, I would
give anything to marry Walter.

693
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:43,364
He's so unexpected.

694
00:45:43,473 --> 00:45:48,467
You think you can tell what he's like
by just looking at him, but you can't.

695
00:45:48,578 --> 00:45:51,012
I should write something
in this about magic.

696
00:45:51,114 --> 00:45:52,706
- What?
- Something.

697
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:56,513
What if I never meet him? What if this
man is my destiny and I never meet him?

698
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,521
Your destiny can be your doom.
Look at me and Rick.

699
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:01,557
"I want to meet you-"

700
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:04,991
<i>- The top of the Empire State Building?
- The top of the Empire State Building.</i>

701
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,858
<i>That's perfect.</i>

702
00:46:06,963 --> 00:46:09,363
Sunset, Valentine's Day.

703
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:14,763
I'll be in New York with Walter.
I can squeeze it in.

704
00:46:14,871 --> 00:46:17,635
I'll be in New York with Walter.

705
00:46:24,447 --> 00:46:26,711
Do you want to
hear about destiny?

706
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:30,685
<i>If I hadn't married Martin, I wouldn't
have had the house with the dead tree.</i>

707
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:33,187
On account of which,
I got divorced.

708
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:37,056
On account of which, I hit a car
and met Rick while buying a neck brace.

709
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:41,358
Wait. You never told me you got
a divorce because of a dead tree.

710
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:43,731
The tree man.

711
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:45,825
You fell in love
with the tree man?

712
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:48,734
I did not say "love. "
Did I say "love"?

713
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,205
This is my favorite part.

714
00:46:53,276 --> 00:46:55,176
<i>It's now or never.</i>

715
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,376
<i>"Never" is a frightening word.</i>

716
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:02,480
<i>We'd be fools
to let happiness pass us by.</i>

717
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:09,285
<i>Winter must be cold
for those with no warm memories.</i>

718
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,463
<i>We've already missed the spring.</i>

719
00:47:17,133 --> 00:47:19,294
Men never get this movie.

720
00:47:19,402 --> 00:47:20,960
I know.

721
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:25,404
Mommy! Mommy!

722
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:30,870
It's okay. I'm here.

723
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:33,347
- Dad!
- I'm comin'.

724
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,509
It's all right. It's okay.

725
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:40,923
It's all right. It's okay.
What was that about?

726
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,219
- It was sinking.
- What was?

727
00:47:43,326 --> 00:47:46,625
Our house. There was water
coming in all the windows.

728
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:50,528
Well, it's okay now.

729
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:55,298
It's all right.
So what should we do?

730
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:57,805
Your mother used to...

731
00:47:57,908 --> 00:48:00,308
sing to you
when you had bad dreams.

732
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:03,139
"Bye-Bye, Blackbird. "

733
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,844
I miss her.

734
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:11,785
What do you think happens
to someone after they die?

735
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:16,750
- I don't know.
- Like, do you believe in heaven?

736
00:48:20,563 --> 00:48:23,157
I never did.

737
00:48:23,266 --> 00:48:26,633
Or the whole idea of an afterlife,
but now I don't know.

738
00:48:28,104 --> 00:48:30,436
'Cause I have
these dreams about-

739
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:34,140
about your mom.

740
00:48:35,478 --> 00:48:39,574
And we have long talks...

741
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:43,210
about you,
how you're doin'.

742
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:47,017
Which she sort of knows,
but I tell her anyway.

743
00:48:47,123 --> 00:48:49,353
So what is that?

744
00:48:51,494 --> 00:48:53,689
It's sort of an afterlife,
isn't it?

745
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:56,460
I'm starting to forget her.

746
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:16,249
She could peel an apple...

747
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:20,088
in one long...

748
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,090
curly strip.

749
00:49:23,893 --> 00:49:26,020
The whole apple.

750
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,927
<i>Pack up all my cares and woes</i>

751
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,828
<i>Feelin' low</i>

752
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:34,699
<i>Here I go</i>

753
00:49:34,804 --> 00:49:38,763
<i>I say bye-bye</i>

754
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:40,342
I love you, Jonah.

755
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:43,744
I love you, Dad.

756
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:51,753
See you tomorrow.

757
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:58,020
<i>Sugar's sweet
So is she</i>

758
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:00,562
<i>I say bye</i>

759
00:50:00,663 --> 00:50:02,961
<i>Bye</i>

760
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:04,966
<i>Blackbird</i>

761
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:15,473
<i>No one seems to love</i>

762
00:50:15,578 --> 00:50:19,514
<i>Or understand me now</i>

763
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:26,188
<i>Oh, and hard luck stories</i>

764
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:30,816
<i>They keep handin' me, yeah</i>

765
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:38,393

<i>Somebody love me now</i>

771
00:51:05,728 --> 00:51:08,925
Laurie?
Hi, it's Annie.

772
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:11,057
Fine. I'm fine.

773
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:14,796
Listen. I'm doing an article
on call-in radio shows.

774
00:51:14,904 --> 00:51:18,567
Do you know anyone who works for
someone named Dr. Marcia Fieldstone?

775
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:21,838
<i>I'm a writer for the Baltimore Sun
and a friend of Laurie Johnson's.</i>

776
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:24,607
I'm doing a piece on how
people handle bereavement...

777
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:28,741
and I understand you had a caller
the other night, some guy from Seattle.

778
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:40,223
<i>This is Jonah Baldwin. We're not in
right now, but you can leave-</i>

779
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:46,093
Architect.

780
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:23,961
Okay, Clarise, I'm gonna be back
either by midnight...

781
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:26,592
or 8:30, if disaster strikes.

782
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,694
Here's one for both of us.

783
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:31,467
- "Sleepless and Son, Baltimore. "
- I left the restaurant's phone number.

784
00:53:31,574 --> 00:53:34,975
If there's a problem, the pediatrician's
number is right above the phone.

785
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:39,640
Here's a bottle of ipecac if anybody
drinks poison. By the juice glasses.

786
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:41,740
- Fine.
- How do I look?

787
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:44,115
- Great.
- Do I look okay?

788
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:48,316
Do I look all right? I look stupid.
I look like I'm tryin' too hard.

789
00:53:48,424 --> 00:53:50,984
I was gonna get a haircut,
but then I'd look like I got one.

790
00:53:51,094 --> 00:53:54,257
- This is a good letter, Dad.
- The heels on these shoes are grotesque.

791
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:55,888
Looks like
I'm tryin' to be tall.

792
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:59,059
Her name is Annie.
Annie Reed.

793
00:53:59,168 --> 00:54:00,601
- Bye.
- Read this!

794
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,261
Read this!

795
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:08,170
"Dear Sleepless and Son,
I've never written-" Blah, blah.

796
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:10,838
"I've been an excellent third baseman
for as long as I remember...

797
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:13,279
and while we're on the subject,
let's just say that...

798
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:15,817
Brooks Robinson
was the best third baseman ever.

799
00:54:15,918 --> 00:54:18,318
It's important you agree with me,
because I'm from Baltimore. "

800
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,889
She thinks Brooks Robinson's
the greatest. So do you.

801
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:23,754
- Everyone thinks he's the greatest.
- It's a sign.

802
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,293
Come here.

803
00:54:26,629 --> 00:54:28,597
I'll show you a sign.
Here's a sign.

804
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:31,223
All right.

805
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:33,359
Where is Seattle?
Right.

806
00:54:33,469 --> 00:54:35,699
Where is Baltimore?

807
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:37,830
It's right there! Look!

808
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:41,501
One, two, three, four- There's like
26 states between here and there.

809
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,044
Now that's a sign.

810
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:45,740
I'm outta here.
Good-bye. Good night.

811
00:54:45,848 --> 00:54:47,406
I love you.

812
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,450
Clarise, did you move your car?

813
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:05,896
- Thank you, Derrick.
- You're welcome.

814
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:07,469
- I'll have-
- White wine?

815
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:10,771
- And you, sir?
- I'm fine, thank you.

816
00:55:11,974 --> 00:55:15,740
- You look good.
- You look good yourself.

817
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:23,308
- I thought you were never gonna call me.
- You did?

818
00:55:23,419 --> 00:55:26,547
But I really wanted you to,
and I thought you were never going to.

819
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,556
<i>- Excuse me, Mr. Baldwin?
- Yes?</i>

820
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,558
There's a phone call for you.

821
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:39,266
Thank you.
Hello?

822
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:42,566
<i>Dad, can we go to New York City
for Valentine's Day?</i>

823
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:44,901
What?

824
00:55:45,007 --> 00:55:47,134
<i>Annie Reed from Baltimore
wants to meet us...</i>

825
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:51,543
<i>at the top of the Empire State Building
on Valentine's Day.</i>

826
00:55:51,647 --> 00:55:53,547
<i>- Jonah.
- What?</i>

827
00:55:53,649 --> 00:55:56,209
Have you fallen down?
Are you bleeding?

828
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:59,254
Is Clarise there?
Has she been strangled?

829
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,323
So this is the only reason
for this phone call?

830
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:04,154
<i>If we book now,
we can get an excursion fare.</i>

831
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,820
<i>Jessica's parents are travel agents,
and Jessica says-</i>

832
00:56:06,929 --> 00:56:08,897
I'm not going to have
this conversation now.

833
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:11,228
We will talk about it
at a later time.

834
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:14,599
I can't believe this conversation
has lasted this long. You go to bed.

835
00:56:22,211 --> 00:56:23,610
Everything all right?

836
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,738
Oh, yeah.
Do you have kids?

837
00:56:25,848 --> 00:56:27,315
- No.
- Want mine?

838
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:33,217
I will have an Absolut
straight up, please.

839
00:56:33,322 --> 00:56:34,880
Sure.

840
00:56:52,608 --> 00:56:55,509
Put that down! Stop it!

841
00:56:55,611 --> 00:56:58,273
There she is.

842
00:56:58,381 --> 00:57:02,147
- Why is she bringing those groceries?
- She's cooking for us, so be prepared.

843
00:57:02,251 --> 00:57:05,118
Hi, Sam. Thanks.
Thanks.

844
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:07,917
And let me guess.
You must be Jonah.

845
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,327
- This it?
- Yeah.

846
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:15,659
- The car's down this way.
- Great.

847
00:57:17,266 --> 00:57:19,257
<i>She's on her sixth painter...</i>

848
00:57:19,368 --> 00:57:21,268
and we're never
gonna finish this job.

849
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,361
Now she wants
the fireplace re-bricked.

850
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:25,737
I know her pretty well.
I could give her a call.

851
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:29,539
I've got it solved. I'm just gonna hit
her with one of those fireplace bricks.

852
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:35,942
Oh, that is so funny.
You are so funny.

853
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:38,919
Whenever she wants anything done,
she does this song and dance about...

854
00:57:39,021 --> 00:57:41,251
"I don't know. I'm stupid.
You tell me.

855
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:44,326
<i>You know better than I,
but couldn't we flip the house...</i>

856
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:48,056
so everything on one side is now on the
other, and the back becomes the front?

857
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:50,189
Could the whole house
open up on a hinge?

858
00:57:50,299 --> 00:57:53,735
That way I could just get in
with the garage door opener. "

859
00:57:53,836 --> 00:57:57,397
<i>I just say, "Yeah, we can do that.
We're just gonna have to-"</i>

860
00:57:57,507 --> 00:58:00,408
"Move the kitchen cabinets. "

861
00:58:07,583 --> 00:58:09,210
Jonah, bring that stuff.

862
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,719
Do you like baseball?

863
00:58:14,156 --> 00:58:16,124
Yes, I do.

864
00:58:16,225 --> 00:58:19,661
<i>My firm has box seats to the Mariners.
Why don't we all go sometime?</i>

865
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:24,298
- What about camping?
- What about it?

866
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,801
- Do you like camping?
- I went camping once.

867
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,599
<i>You know what?
We oughta start camping more often.</i>

868
00:58:31,707 --> 00:58:35,040
You're right. Camping is good.
Time for bed.

869
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:37,442
- It's only 10:00.
- Yeah, 10:00.

870
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:39,606
Time for bed.

871
00:58:39,715 --> 00:58:41,342
Good night.

872
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:48,548
Don't you wanna thank Victoria
for this delicious dinner?

873
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:52,492
Thanks for dinner. I never saw
anybody cook potatoes that way.

874
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:56,227
I'm glad you liked it.

875
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:58,232
Good night, Jonah.

876
00:59:01,103 --> 00:59:03,799
Yeah, we don't see
a lot of potatoes around here.

877
00:59:03,906 --> 00:59:05,806
We're rice men.

878
01:00:00,533 --> 01:00:03,161
I'm sorry, Walter.
I'm sorry.

879
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,704
<i>- Hello?
- Turn on your radio.</i>

880
01:00:09,809 --> 01:00:11,709
<i>- What?
- The kid is on.</i>

881
01:00:11,811 --> 01:00:14,371
<i>You've got me
listening to this garbage.</i>

882
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,846
Who is it?

883
01:00:16,949 --> 01:00:21,079
It's Becky. She's-
She's having trouble with Rick again.

884
01:00:21,187 --> 01:00:24,088
I'll go downstairs, Becky.
I'll call you back.

885
01:00:26,926 --> 01:00:29,554
I'm sorry, Walter.
Are you bleeding?

886
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:53,678
<i>- He's kissing her right this minute!
- Oh, really?</i>

887
01:00:53,786 --> 01:00:57,483
<i>Jonah, tell the truth.
Are you spying on your father?</i>

888
01:00:57,590 --> 01:01:00,684
<i>- Who's he kissing right this minute?
- Listen to this.</i>

889
01:01:00,793 --> 01:01:02,693
<i>I have to make them stop.</i>

890
01:01:02,795 --> 01:01:06,356
<i>- How am I gonna explain this to Walter?
- She came over and cooked dinner.</i>

891
01:01:06,466 --> 01:01:09,560
<i>She brought two bags of groceries,
like she was staying for a year.</i>

892
01:01:09,669 --> 01:01:12,570
<i>Jonah, it's good
that your father's dating.</i>

893
01:01:12,672 --> 01:01:15,903
<i>It's just hard on you.
It's something you think you want.</i>

894
01:01:16,008 --> 01:01:19,774
<i>- Then when it happens, it scares you.
- That's not true.</i>

895
01:01:19,879 --> 01:01:22,814
<i>Think. Shouldn't your father
be the judge...</i>

896
01:01:22,915 --> 01:01:25,816
<i>of whether someone is right
or wrong for him?</i>

897
01:01:25,918 --> 01:01:27,886
<i>He's not sane enough
to judge anything.</i>

898
01:01:27,987 --> 01:01:30,717
Now he's kissing her on the lips.
She's a 'ho!

899
01:01:30,823 --> 01:01:33,883
My dad's been captured by a 'ho!
What am I going to do?

900
01:01:33,993 --> 01:01:35,927
<i>Calm down, Jonah.</i>

901
01:01:36,028 --> 01:01:38,724
<i>Tomorrow morning when you're
having breakfast with your dad...</i>

902
01:01:38,831 --> 01:01:41,129
<i>tell him how you feel.</i>

903
01:01:41,234 --> 01:01:44,726
<i>It's not good to keep
your feelings inside you.</i>

904
01:01:49,041 --> 01:01:52,704
Miss Scarlet. In the broom closet.
With the radio.

905
01:01:55,948 --> 01:01:58,849
You scared me.
Don't ever do that again.

906
01:02:02,488 --> 01:02:05,480
<i>- I thought I saw a black widow.
- You scared me to death!</i>

907
01:02:05,591 --> 01:02:08,856
- You scared Victoria to death.
- It was right over there.

908
01:02:08,961 --> 01:02:12,624
The next time you think you see a
black widow spider, I want you to say...

909
01:02:12,732 --> 01:02:16,600
<i>"Dad, excuse me, but I believe
a poisonous insect is in the house"...</i>

910
01:02:16,702 --> 01:02:18,863
and I will calmly come
and take care of it.

911
01:02:18,971 --> 01:02:20,495
<i>Scream again, I'll kill you.</i>

912
01:02:20,606 --> 01:02:25,100
Becky heard this guy on the radio she
was sure was Rick. She was hysterical.

913
01:02:25,211 --> 01:02:29,375
And then it turned out
the guy lived in Duluth.

914
01:02:29,482 --> 01:02:32,383
- Where is Duluth?
- That doesn't make any sense.

915
01:02:32,485 --> 01:02:35,943
I know, Walter.
It doesn't make any sense at all.

916
01:02:36,055 --> 01:02:38,649
Thank God my life is in place.

917
01:02:38,758 --> 01:02:41,625
Duluth? That's in North Dakota.

918
01:02:55,641 --> 01:02:59,600
I love this letter.
You have to write to her.

919
01:02:59,712 --> 01:03:02,806
- You think so?
- It's Y.O.H.

920
01:03:02,915 --> 01:03:05,076
Yeah. What's that?

921
01:03:05,184 --> 01:03:06,776
Your only hope.

922
01:03:18,865 --> 01:03:22,062
I thought I would look into
doing a story on those radio shows.

923
01:03:23,536 --> 01:03:25,834
You'd probably have to go somewhere
to really look into it.

924
01:03:26,506 --> 01:03:28,633
Definitely.

925
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,453
Couldn't you do
a phone interview?

926
01:03:49,562 --> 01:03:54,124
Not for the kind of piece I wanna do.
I won't be in Chicago that long.

927
01:03:54,233 --> 01:03:56,292
When you get back, I'll be gone.

928
01:03:56,402 --> 01:03:58,836
And then I'll see you in New York.

929
01:03:58,938 --> 01:04:00,701
I'll get it.

930
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:06,109
<i>This is Captain Browning.</i>

931
01:04:06,212 --> 01:04:09,773
<i>We're at our cruising altitude
of approximately 35,000 feet.</i>

932
01:04:09,882 --> 01:04:14,649
<i>The weather is clear to the west, and we
expect to arrive in Seattle on schedule.</i>

933
01:04:15,755 --> 01:04:18,622
- Don't you hate flying?
- Yes, I do.

934
01:04:18,724 --> 01:04:23,593
<i>And I just told the most terrible one
to the man I'm about to marry.</i>

935
01:04:23,696 --> 01:04:26,460
Do you feel that
any lie is a betrayal?

936
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,468
I said "flying. "

937
01:04:37,443 --> 01:04:39,343
Thanks for bringing me out here.

938
01:04:39,445 --> 01:04:41,845
Well, he likes the planes.

939
01:04:41,948 --> 01:04:46,317
Can I bring something back for you?
A souvenir? Does he like snow globes?

940
01:04:46,419 --> 01:04:48,853
You shake them up
and then the snow floats down.

941
01:04:48,955 --> 01:04:52,618
Sure. I'd really like that.
Thank you so much.

942
01:04:56,829 --> 01:04:58,922
- He's eight.
- He's good at it.

943
01:04:59,031 --> 01:05:00,931
I read an article about this.

944
01:05:01,033 --> 01:05:04,127
All children are hideous at age eight.
It's quite normal.

945
01:05:04,236 --> 01:05:06,431
Well, maybe when I come back...

946
01:05:06,539 --> 01:05:09,872
the two of us oughta spend
some time together on our own.

947
01:05:09,976 --> 01:05:12,001
What do you think?

948
01:05:15,281 --> 01:05:17,181
Bye.

949
01:05:17,283 --> 01:05:18,910
Bye, Jonah.

950
01:05:26,359 --> 01:05:29,920
Listen to me.
You don't know Victoria.

951
01:05:30,029 --> 01:05:31,929
I hardly know her myself.

952
01:05:32,031 --> 01:05:34,932
She is, in fact,
a mystery to me.

953
01:05:35,034 --> 01:05:38,333
She tosses her hair a lot.
Why does she do this?

954
01:05:38,437 --> 01:05:41,270
I have no idea. Is it a twitch?
Does she need a haircut?

955
01:05:41,374 --> 01:05:44,866
Should she use a barrette
to keep her hair out of her face?

956
01:05:46,379 --> 01:05:49,542
These are things I'm willing
to get to the bottom of.

957
01:05:49,649 --> 01:05:52,982
And that is why I am dating her.

958
01:05:54,253 --> 01:05:56,312
That's all I'm doing.

959
01:05:56,422 --> 01:05:58,686
<i>I'm not living with her.
I'm not marrying her.</i>

960
01:05:58,791 --> 01:06:01,555
Can you appreciate
the difference?

961
01:06:03,029 --> 01:06:04,496
This is what single people do.

962
01:06:04,597 --> 01:06:07,395
They try other people on
and see how they fit.

963
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:10,230
But everybody's an adjustment.
Nobody's perfect.

964
01:06:11,203 --> 01:06:13,763
There's no such thing
as a perfect-

965
01:06:29,989 --> 01:06:31,547
Come on.

966
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:37,223
Dad, I was talking to Jessica
about reincarnation.

967
01:06:37,329 --> 01:06:39,388
She says you knew Annie
in another life.

968
01:06:39,498 --> 01:06:42,023
- Who's Annie?
- The one who wrote us.

969
01:06:42,134 --> 01:06:45,626
But Jessica says you and Annie
never got together in that life.

970
01:06:45,738 --> 01:06:48,366
<i>So your hearts are like puzzles
with missing pieces.</i>

971
01:06:48,474 --> 01:06:50,635
And when you get together,
the puzzle's complete.

972
01:06:50,743 --> 01:06:52,233
Goddamn it.

973
01:06:52,344 --> 01:06:55,370
The reason I know this and you don't
is because I'm younger and purer...

974
01:06:55,481 --> 01:06:58,575
so I'm more in touch
with cosmic forces.

975
01:06:58,684 --> 01:07:01,482
- Who told you this stuff?
- Jessica.

976
01:07:01,587 --> 01:07:04,420
I sincerely hope
you're not marrying Jessica.

977
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:15,358
<i>I remember the days
of just keepin' time</i>

978
01:07:15,468 --> 01:07:19,734
<i>Of hangin' around
in sleepy towns</i>

979
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:21,966
<i>Forever</i>

980
01:07:22,074 --> 01:07:25,908
<i>Back roads empty for miles</i>

981
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:32,283
<i>Well, you can't have a dream
and cut it to fit</i>

982
01:07:32,384 --> 01:07:36,184
<i>But when I saw you
I knew</i>

983
01:07:36,288 --> 01:07:38,722
<i>We'd go together</i>

984
01:07:38,824 --> 01:07:42,157
<i>Like a wink and a smile</i>

985
01:07:45,831 --> 01:07:49,767
<i>Leave your old jalopy</i>

986
01:07:49,869 --> 01:07:53,999
<i>By the railroad track</i>

987
01:07:54,106 --> 01:07:58,270
<i>We'll get a hip
double-dip, tip-toppy</i>

988
01:07:58,377 --> 01:08:01,471
<i>Two-seat Pontiac</i>

989
01:08:03,883 --> 01:08:06,977
<i>So you can rev her up</i>

990
01:08:07,086 --> 01:08:08,986
<i>Don't go slow</i>

991
01:08:09,088 --> 01:08:12,524
<i>It's only green lights
and all rights</i>

992
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:15,753
<i>Let's go together</i>

993
01:08:15,861 --> 01:08:18,625
<i>With a wink and a smile</i>

994
01:08:32,978 --> 01:08:35,913
<i>Give me a wink and a smile</i>

995
01:08:47,893 --> 01:08:49,793
<i>We go together</i>

996
01:08:49,895 --> 01:08:52,625
<i>Like a wink and a smile</i>

997
01:08:56,569 --> 01:09:00,130
<i>Now my heart hears music</i>

998
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:02,969
<i>Such a simple song</i>

999
01:09:04,577 --> 01:09:08,513
<i>Sing it again
The notes never end</i>

1000
01:09:08,614 --> 01:09:12,015
<i>This is where I belong</i>

1001
01:09:13,352 --> 01:09:16,913
<i>Just the sound of your voice
The light in your eyes</i>

1002
01:09:17,022 --> 01:09:21,584
<i>We're so far away
from yesterday</i>

1003
01:09:21,694 --> 01:09:24,219
<i>Together</i>

1004
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:27,493
<i>With a wink and a smile</i>

1005
01:09:30,436 --> 01:09:34,099
<i>We go together</i>

1006
01:09:34,206 --> 01:09:38,074
<i>Like a wink and a smile</i>

1007
01:09:48,153 --> 01:09:51,850
<i>- I watched him play with his son.
- Did you talk to him?</i>

1008
01:09:52,958 --> 01:09:54,858
<i>I couldn't do it.</i>

1009
01:09:56,996 --> 01:10:00,397
<i>- How did I get here?
- You told a lie and got on a plane.</i>

1010
01:10:00,499 --> 01:10:02,467
That's not what I mean.

1011
01:10:03,903 --> 01:10:07,771
I'm going back over there tomorrow
and talk to him. I am.

1012
01:10:07,873 --> 01:10:10,933
<i>Okay. Good.
Good-bye.</i>

1013
01:10:11,043 --> 01:10:12,943
<i>- Beck?
- What?</i>

1014
01:10:15,447 --> 01:10:17,745
<i>- Is this crazy?
- No.</i>

1015
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:20,182
<i>That's the weirdest part about it.</i>

1016
01:10:21,287 --> 01:10:23,983
Thank you.
I love you.

1017
01:10:24,089 --> 01:10:26,683
<i>- I love you too.
- Good night.</i>

1018
01:11:29,321 --> 01:11:32,722
Oh, it's so good to see you.
Where's Greg?

1019
01:11:57,016 --> 01:11:57,914
Hello.

1020
01:12:07,259 --> 01:12:11,389
<i>- So then what happened?
- So then I left, obviously.</i>

1021
01:12:12,264 --> 01:12:14,198
You were standing
in the middle of the street?

1022
01:12:14,299 --> 01:12:18,065
You know that dream when you're on the
street naked and everyone is looking?

1023
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:19,831
I love that dream.

1024
01:12:19,938 --> 01:12:23,533
That was nothing compared
to this humiliation. Nothing.

1025
01:12:23,642 --> 01:12:25,667
- But he saw you, right?
- He saw me.

1026
01:12:25,778 --> 01:12:29,236
- You were face-to-face?
- He said hello.

1027
01:12:29,348 --> 01:12:32,749
- He said hello, and what did you say?
- All I could say was hello.

1028
01:12:33,852 --> 01:12:35,683
Oh, my God!

1029
01:12:35,788 --> 01:12:39,622
<i>And all I could say was hello.</i>

1030
01:12:39,725 --> 01:12:41,750
It's a sign.

1031
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:46,024
It's a sign that I have watched
this movie too many times.

1032
01:12:47,132 --> 01:12:48,759
So stupid.

1033
01:12:48,867 --> 01:12:53,736
Since I listened to that stupid program
on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.

1034
01:12:53,839 --> 01:12:56,501
- You are not a jerk.
- Thank you.

1035
01:12:56,608 --> 01:12:59,736
- Idiot.
- You don't know who she was.

1036
01:12:59,845 --> 01:13:03,747
I saw her. I have a picture of her.
I'll show you a picture of her.

1037
01:13:03,849 --> 01:13:06,682
That detective in Seattle
sent me a picture of her.

1038
01:13:06,785 --> 01:13:08,685
Here. See?

1039
01:13:08,787 --> 01:13:11,119
<i>That's exactly
what she looks like.</i>

1040
01:13:11,223 --> 01:13:13,384
This is a picture
of someone's back.

1041
01:13:13,492 --> 01:13:16,723
Well, it's her
and he was crazy about her.

1042
01:13:16,829 --> 01:13:20,196
What's this?
This is from Seattle.

1043
01:13:32,177 --> 01:13:34,077
So I mailed your letter.

1044
01:13:36,482 --> 01:13:39,280
"Dear Annie,
thanks for your letter.

1045
01:13:39,384 --> 01:13:42,512
It was great.
You sound neat.

1046
01:13:45,858 --> 01:13:49,555
<i>We're very excited about meeting you
in New York on Valentine's Day...</i>

1047
01:13:49,661 --> 01:13:52,459
and seeing if we are...

1048
01:13:52,564 --> 01:13:55,089
M.F.E.O.

1049
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,599
See you soon.

1050
01:13:57,402 --> 01:14:00,166
Sleepless in Seattle. "

1051
01:14:00,272 --> 01:14:01,500
M.F. E.O.?

1052
01:14:06,044 --> 01:14:08,672
Made for each other.

1053
01:14:09,681 --> 01:14:12,946
<i>It's cute.
It's like a little clue.</i>

1054
01:14:17,589 --> 01:14:20,820
So he can't write. Big deal.

1055
01:14:20,926 --> 01:14:23,724
Verbal ability is a highly
overrated thing in a guy...

1056
01:14:23,829 --> 01:14:26,696
and our pathetic need for it
is what gets us into trouble.

1057
01:14:26,798 --> 01:14:30,666
I will be running back to Walter's arms,
if he'll still have me.

1058
01:14:30,769 --> 01:14:32,794
- What about the letter?
- It means nothing.

1059
01:14:32,905 --> 01:14:36,102
It was written before
I went out there, before the 'ho.

1060
01:14:39,611 --> 01:14:43,047
The only thing is,
she didn't look like a 'ho.

1061
01:14:43,148 --> 01:14:45,981
She looked like somebody
we would've been friends with.

1062
01:14:50,656 --> 01:14:53,523
- You saw her in the airport, then here?
- I tried to talk to her.

1063
01:14:53,625 --> 01:14:55,991
It was like I knew her.
It was weird.

1064
01:14:56,094 --> 01:14:57,493
Like a d¨¦j¨¤ vu thing?

1065
01:14:57,596 --> 01:15:01,726
<i>It was a very French
d¨¦j¨¤ vu-ish kind of thing. Oui.</i>

1066
01:15:01,833 --> 01:15:05,325
At least you're out there
seeing people again. That's terrific.

1067
01:15:05,437 --> 01:15:07,371
<i>Well, there's really just the one.</i>

1068
01:15:07,973 --> 01:15:10,339
Victoria.

1069
01:15:10,442 --> 01:15:13,240
- You don't like Victoria?
- She laughs like a hyena.

1070
01:15:14,012 --> 01:15:15,912
Is this true?

1071
01:15:17,249 --> 01:15:20,275
Sort of, a little bit.
Tell them what you did.

1072
01:15:21,587 --> 01:15:24,021
<i>Tell 'em about the radio show.
They wanna hear it.</i>

1073
01:15:24,122 --> 01:15:28,923
Tell 'em. Christmas Eve, he phones in
one of those radio call-in shows.

1074
01:15:29,027 --> 01:15:31,962
Tells them I need a new wife.

1075
01:15:32,064 --> 01:15:33,793
Oh, you're kidding.

1076
01:15:33,899 --> 01:15:35,867
That's so sweet.

1077
01:15:35,968 --> 01:15:39,927
- He's obsessed with a lady who wrote me.
- You serious?

1078
01:15:40,038 --> 01:15:42,973
She wants to meet me at the top
of the Empire State Building.

1079
01:15:43,075 --> 01:15:45,543
On Valentine's Day.

1080
01:15:45,644 --> 01:15:48,306
- It's like that movie.
- What movie?

1081
01:15:48,413 --> 01:15:51,280
<i>An Affair To Remember.
Did you ever see it?</i>

1082
01:15:51,383 --> 01:15:53,351
Oh, God.

1083
01:15:53,452 --> 01:15:56,649
Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.
Is it "car" or "cur"?

1084
01:15:56,755 --> 01:15:58,279
- Cur.
- Car.

1085
01:16:00,259 --> 01:16:02,955
<i>She's gonna meet him at the top
of the Empire State Building...</i>

1086
01:16:03,061 --> 01:16:05,586
only she got hit by a taxi.

1087
01:16:05,697 --> 01:16:07,597
And he waited and waited.

1088
01:16:07,699 --> 01:16:10,668
And it was raining, I think.

1089
01:16:10,769 --> 01:16:11,827
And then...

1090
01:16:11,937 --> 01:16:15,168
she's too proud to tell him...

1091
01:16:15,274 --> 01:16:17,401
that she's, uh...

1092
01:16:19,845 --> 01:16:21,836
crippled.

1093
01:16:21,947 --> 01:16:25,747
And he's too proud to find out
why she doesn't come.

1094
01:16:25,851 --> 01:16:27,785
<i>But he comes to see her anyway.</i>

1095
01:16:27,886 --> 01:16:30,150
I forget why, but, oh-

1096
01:16:30,255 --> 01:16:34,521
Oh, it's so amazing
when he comes to see her because...

1097
01:16:34,626 --> 01:16:38,687
he doesn't even notice that
she doesn't get up to say hello.

1098
01:16:38,797 --> 01:16:41,265
And he's very bitter.

1099
01:16:42,668 --> 01:16:47,037
And you think that he's just gonna
walk out the door...

1100
01:16:47,139 --> 01:16:51,803
and never know why she's just
lying there, you know, on the couch...

1101
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:56,313
with this blanket
over her shriveled little legs.

1102
01:16:58,483 --> 01:17:01,543
<i>- Are you all right?
- She's fine.</i>

1103
01:17:01,653 --> 01:17:05,089
Suddenly he goes,
"I already sold the painting. "

1104
01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:08,216
And he like
goes to the bedroom...

1105
01:17:08,327 --> 01:17:12,354
and he looks and he comes out and
he looks at her and he kind of just-

1106
01:17:12,464 --> 01:17:15,991
They know and then they hug.
And it's so-

1107
01:17:16,968 --> 01:17:20,233
- That's a chick's movie.
- I would say so.

1108
01:17:20,339 --> 01:17:23,672
What kind of a person would write
to someone they heard on the radio?

1109
01:17:23,775 --> 01:17:26,835
I got hundreds of letters
from women all over the country.

1110
01:17:26,945 --> 01:17:28,344
Desperate women.

1111
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:31,746
Just because someone is looking for
a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.

1112
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:34,182
How about rapacious
and love-starved?

1113
01:17:34,286 --> 01:17:37,380
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist
than to find a husband after the age-

1114
01:17:37,489 --> 01:17:39,582
That is absolutely untrue.

1115
01:17:39,691 --> 01:17:41,886
Right, honey. Right.

1116
01:17:41,993 --> 01:17:44,359
<i>I'm not lookin' for
a mail-order bride.</i>

1117
01:17:44,463 --> 01:17:48,456
I just want somebody that I can have a
decent conversation with over dinner...

1118
01:17:48,567 --> 01:17:52,059
without it fallin' down
into weepy tears over some movie.

1119
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:53,637
She's very emotional.

1120
01:17:53,739 --> 01:17:55,832
<i>- But I cried at The Dirty Dozen.
- Who didn't?</i>

1121
01:17:55,941 --> 01:17:59,377
Jim Brown is throwin' these
hand grenades down these air shafts...

1122
01:17:59,478 --> 01:18:02,641
and Richard Jaeckel and Lee Marvin
were sittin' on top of this...

1123
01:18:02,748 --> 01:18:05,512
armored personnel carrier,
dressed up like Nazis.

1124
01:18:05,617 --> 01:18:08,780
They're waiting.
Trini L¨®pez-

1125
01:18:10,122 --> 01:18:13,489
He busted his neck when they were
parachuting down behind the Nazi lines.

1126
01:18:13,592 --> 01:18:15,116
Stop it.

1127
01:18:15,227 --> 01:18:19,254
Richard Jaeckel had on this shiny helmet
'cause he was the M.P.

1128
01:18:19,364 --> 01:18:20,262
No more.

1129
01:18:21,566 --> 01:18:24,296
Oh, God, I love that movie.

1130
01:18:32,144 --> 01:18:35,375
This is the best movie
I've ever seen in my life.

1131
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,175
<i>What's so great about it?</i>

1132
01:18:37,282 --> 01:18:39,842
You have to find her.
You have to go to her.

1133
01:18:39,951 --> 01:18:42,078
Do you know how much money it costs
to go to New York?

1134
01:18:42,187 --> 01:18:44,087
Nobody knows.

1135
01:18:44,189 --> 01:18:48,285
It changes practically every day.
How much money do you have?

1136
01:18:48,393 --> 01:18:49,792
Eighty dollars.

1137
01:18:49,895 --> 01:18:53,262
I have 42. That would
probably cover taxicabs.

1138
01:18:53,365 --> 01:18:54,832
How would I get there?

1139
01:18:55,934 --> 01:18:58,402
Honey, I have to run
these tickets over to someone.

1140
01:18:58,503 --> 01:19:00,403
Can you keep an eye on things?

1141
01:19:00,505 --> 01:19:02,564
Sure, Mom.

1142
01:19:12,784 --> 01:19:16,083
- Do you want a window seat or an aisle?
- Window.

1143
01:19:16,188 --> 01:19:18,452
- Do you want a fruit plate?
- I don't know. Do I?

1144
01:19:18,557 --> 01:19:21,253
I'd rather die
than eat airplane food.

1145
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:23,554
I'm telling them you're 12
so you can fly unaccompanied...

1146
01:19:23,662 --> 01:19:25,653
and the stewardess
won't carry you around.

1147
01:19:25,764 --> 01:19:28,358
Are you crazy?
Who'd believe I'm 12?

1148
01:19:28,467 --> 01:19:31,368
If it's in the computer,
they believe anything.

1149
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:33,370
Are you sure?

1150
01:19:33,472 --> 01:19:35,872
Do you want me to say that
you're really short for your age...

1151
01:19:35,974 --> 01:19:38,101
and that they shouldn't say anything
'cause it would hurt your feelings?

1152
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:40,508
Yeah, that's a great idea.

1153
01:19:40,612 --> 01:19:45,447
<i>Sometimes it's hard to be</i>

1154
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:47,484
<i>A woman</i>

1155
01:19:50,422 --> 01:19:53,448
<i>Givin' all your love</i>

1156
01:19:53,558 --> 01:19:58,018
<i>To just one man</i>

1157
01:19:58,129 --> 01:19:59,391
Walter.

1158
01:20:00,732 --> 01:20:04,463
- You're gonna miss the train.
- No, I'm not.

1159
01:20:04,569 --> 01:20:08,198
I'm so happy, Becky.
Finally I feel happy.

1160
01:20:08,306 --> 01:20:10,206
This is right. This is real.

1161
01:20:10,308 --> 01:20:13,004
Everything else is what happens
when you watch too many movies...

1162
01:20:13,111 --> 01:20:15,579
and you completely
lose sight of what counts.

1163
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,910
Please, don't tell anybody
what happened.

1164
01:20:18,016 --> 01:20:20,576
I would be so absolutely mortified
if anyone knew...

1165
01:20:20,685 --> 01:20:23,950
I did anything even
remotely close to what I've done.

1166
01:20:24,055 --> 01:20:27,024
<i>- Thank you. Do you promise?
- I promise.</i>

1167
01:20:27,125 --> 01:20:29,525
Sleepless in Seattle
is history.

1168
01:20:29,628 --> 01:20:33,689
<i>He's hard to understand</i>

1169
01:20:35,934 --> 01:20:40,394
<i>And if you love him</i>

1170
01:20:40,505 --> 01:20:44,999
<i>Oh, be proud of him</i>

1171
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:48,409
<i>'Cause after all</i>

1172
01:20:48,513 --> 01:20:51,277
<i>He's just a man</i>

1173
01:20:54,519 --> 01:20:57,420
<i>Stand by your man</i>

1174
01:21:00,392 --> 01:21:01,950
I was-

1175
01:21:03,395 --> 01:21:05,329
- Go ahead.
- You go.

1176
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:07,830
Okay. Well,
I was just gonna say...

1177
01:21:07,933 --> 01:21:11,494
<i>that ever since Christmas,
you've been different...</i>

1178
01:21:11,603 --> 01:21:14,128
kind of distracted, distant.

1179
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:16,673
But now...

1180
01:21:16,775 --> 01:21:21,405
it feels as if you're coming back
from wherever you were.

1181
01:21:21,513 --> 01:21:23,071
I am.

1182
01:21:25,016 --> 01:21:27,541
I was just, uh-

1183
01:21:27,652 --> 01:21:31,782
I just got-
I think I got nervous.

1184
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:34,051
But that's normal, right?

1185
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:37,856
I mean, don't you ever
feel nervous about-

1186
01:21:37,963 --> 01:21:39,897
You know?

1187
01:21:39,998 --> 01:21:41,989
What?

1188
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:43,328
Forever.

1189
01:21:53,144 --> 01:21:56,375
I did, and you know what I think?

1190
01:21:56,481 --> 01:22:00,679
I think I thought
it was too perfect, you know?

1191
01:22:00,785 --> 01:22:04,243
I started to wonder
if we were the human equivalent...

1192
01:22:04,356 --> 01:22:06,449
of two rights making a wrong.

1193
01:22:06,558 --> 01:22:08,458
You know what it was?

1194
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,155
It was like kismet, but not,
if you see what I mean.

1195
01:22:13,732 --> 01:22:15,131
You have to grow up.

1196
01:22:15,233 --> 01:22:17,997
You just can't keep having
all these adolescent fantasies...

1197
01:22:18,103 --> 01:22:20,503
about how exciting
your life is gonna be.

1198
01:22:20,605 --> 01:22:23,233
Don't hate me,
but I love this pattern.

1199
01:22:23,341 --> 01:22:25,332
- You couldn't.
- I do.

1200
01:22:25,443 --> 01:22:28,241
This is just like
my grandmother's china.

1201
01:22:28,346 --> 01:22:30,780
How many place settings
should I put down?

1202
01:22:30,882 --> 01:22:32,440
Ten.

1203
01:22:35,153 --> 01:22:37,986
<i>Exactly. Eight is too few.</i>

1204
01:22:38,089 --> 01:22:40,717
Twelve is too many.

1205
01:23:06,284 --> 01:23:08,184
It was my mother's.

1206
01:23:10,188 --> 01:23:12,418
I had them size it down.

1207
01:23:13,858 --> 01:23:15,917
She had really fat fingers.

1208
01:23:18,463 --> 01:23:20,124
It's so beautiful.

1209
01:23:20,231 --> 01:23:23,394
It's exactly what I would
pick out if I had...

1210
01:23:23,501 --> 01:23:26,299
every ring in the whole world
to choose from.

1211
01:23:28,973 --> 01:23:30,440
You see what I mean?

1212
01:23:30,542 --> 01:23:34,034
There are people who would like
a relationship to be full of surprises.

1213
01:23:34,145 --> 01:23:36,477
But I am not one of those people.

1214
01:23:36,581 --> 01:23:38,776
No, sirree.

1215
01:23:38,883 --> 01:23:41,545
Surprises are highly overrated.

1216
01:23:44,456 --> 01:23:47,550
I'm leavin' first thing in the morning,
but I'm only gonna be gone one night.

1217
01:23:47,659 --> 01:23:49,752
Clarise is gonna be here,
so you'll be able to see...

1218
01:23:49,861 --> 01:23:52,159
<i>plenty of Geraldo
and Nightmare On Elm Street 12.</i>

1219
01:23:52,263 --> 01:23:54,527
- I will never know.
- Are you going with her?

1220
01:23:56,501 --> 01:23:58,560
I'm going with Victoria, yes.

1221
01:24:00,839 --> 01:24:03,603
<i>And don't try anything tricky.
Understand?</i>

1222
01:24:06,711 --> 01:24:09,737
Don't go rollin' in poison ivy
as soon as I leave the house...

1223
01:24:09,848 --> 01:24:13,249
or lock yourself in a closet or do
anything that makes you need stitches.

1224
01:24:13,351 --> 01:24:15,410
If your finger falls off,
it's stayin' off.

1225
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,920
No one's gonna pack it on ice
and take you to the hospital...

1226
01:24:18,022 --> 01:24:21,150
so you can be
a breakthrough in laser surgery.

1227
01:24:21,259 --> 01:24:24,285
- Is this about that woman in Baltimore?
- Annie.

1228
01:24:28,833 --> 01:24:31,233
- I don't care what you do!
- Good! Fine!

1229
01:24:31,336 --> 01:24:34,601
I'll tell you what I'm doin'
this weekend. I'm getting laid.

1230
01:24:34,706 --> 01:24:36,674
1990s and nobody is getting laid.

1231
01:24:36,775 --> 01:24:39,403
<i>I'm the only man in America
who is getting laid this weekend.</i>

1232
01:24:39,511 --> 01:24:43,811
I haven't been laid that much.
Six girls in college, maybe seven.

1233
01:24:45,116 --> 01:24:48,051
- How long you been standin' there?
- Forever.

1234
01:24:48,153 --> 01:24:51,953
- What did you hear me just say?
- "Six girls in college, maybe seven. "

1235
01:24:52,056 --> 01:24:54,752
Seven.
Eight! Mary Kelly.

1236
01:24:54,859 --> 01:24:56,292
This is the one I like.

1237
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:01,357
Jonah, the fact is...

1238
01:25:01,466 --> 01:25:04,458
you're not gonna like any woman
because it isn't your mother.

1239
01:25:04,569 --> 01:25:06,127
How do you know?

1240
01:25:06,237 --> 01:25:09,673
- What's wrong with Annie?
- Oh, Jonah, shut up!

1241
01:25:09,774 --> 01:25:12,299
Shut up?

1242
01:25:12,410 --> 01:25:15,811
<i>Mom never said "shut up" to me.
Mom never yelled at me.</i>

1243
01:25:15,914 --> 01:25:19,042
- The conversation is finished.
- Why can't we go to New York?

1244
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:21,880
There is no way
that we are going on a plane...

1245
01:25:21,986 --> 01:25:24,454
to meet some woman
who could be a crazy, sick lunatic.

1246
01:25:24,556 --> 01:25:27,047
<i>- Didn't you see Fatal Attraction?
- You wouldn't let me.</i>

1247
01:25:27,158 --> 01:25:29,683
Well, I saw it!
And it scared the shit outta me.

1248
01:25:29,794 --> 01:25:32,820
It scared the shit
outta every man in America!

1249
01:25:33,798 --> 01:25:36,232
I'm not leaving till you say yes.

1250
01:25:42,006 --> 01:25:44,907
- I hate you!
- That's good!

1251
01:25:45,009 --> 01:25:46,533
You'll have to tell Oprah.

1252
01:25:46,644 --> 01:25:48,908
How your dad destroyed your life
'cause he had to go off...

1253
01:25:49,013 --> 01:25:52,505
for a weekend special
at the Holiday Inn!

1254
01:26:07,031 --> 01:26:10,432
Jonah, Clarise is here
and I gotta go.

1255
01:26:12,503 --> 01:26:14,130
Hey, Jonah.

1256
01:26:21,145 --> 01:26:23,409
All right.
Jonah, listen.

1257
01:26:23,514 --> 01:26:25,846
I gotta go, and I'm-

1258
01:26:54,312 --> 01:26:56,780
Jessica, honey,
you have to tell us where he is.

1259
01:26:56,881 --> 01:27:00,282
Jonah's daddy is very upset.

1260
01:27:00,385 --> 01:27:03,877
This is your father.
Tell us where he is, right this minute.

1261
01:27:07,225 --> 01:27:08,886
N.Y.

1262
01:27:08,993 --> 01:27:10,984
- What is that?
- No way.

1263
01:27:11,095 --> 01:27:13,655
That's N.W.

1264
01:27:13,765 --> 01:27:15,892
New York.

1265
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,900
He's on his way to New York.

1266
01:27:18,002 --> 01:27:19,435
- What?
- How?

1267
01:27:19,537 --> 01:27:22,734
<i>- United 597.
- Jessica.</i>

1268
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:25,434
- When does it leave?
- 7:30.

1269
01:27:32,417 --> 01:27:35,409
Here you go. Here's a nice pen
for you for flying with us.

1270
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:36,919
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1271
01:27:37,021 --> 01:27:39,251
- Can I take this for you?
- No.

1272
01:27:55,139 --> 01:27:57,437
- Where to, kid?
- Empire State Building.

1273
01:27:57,542 --> 01:28:00,340
Hold on.
Empire State Building.

1274
01:28:00,445 --> 01:28:03,778
Get a little further away
from the curb next time, mac.

1275
01:28:05,650 --> 01:28:06,878
There it is.

1276
01:28:06,985 --> 01:28:09,613
What you gonna do
when you get up there?

1277
01:28:09,721 --> 01:28:11,848
- Spit off the top?
- No.

1278
01:28:11,956 --> 01:28:14,550
I'm going to meet my new mother.

1279
01:28:34,512 --> 01:28:37,379
<i>Excuse me. I'm Jonah.
Are you Annie?</i>

1280
01:28:37,482 --> 01:28:39,712
No. I'm Cynthia.

1281
01:28:46,858 --> 01:28:49,418
<i>Excuse me.
Are you Annie?</i>

1282
01:29:27,799 --> 01:29:29,699
Great table. Thanks.

1283
01:29:32,136 --> 01:29:33,865
Something wrong?

1284
01:29:35,073 --> 01:29:37,701
- Can I get you a drink?
- Some champagne?

1285
01:29:39,343 --> 01:29:41,777
Fine.

1286
01:29:41,879 --> 01:29:43,278
Can we have a bottle...

1287
01:29:43,381 --> 01:29:46,248
of Dom DeLuise?

1288
01:29:48,619 --> 01:29:50,519
- Just kidding.
- It was a joke.

1289
01:29:50,621 --> 01:29:53,215
- He meant Dom P¨¦rignon.
- I got it.

1290
01:29:56,828 --> 01:29:59,023
Beautiful view, isn't it?

1291
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:03,931
Walter, there's something
I have to tell you.

1292
01:30:18,483 --> 01:30:20,883
Hey, I'm sorry.
I have an emergency.

1293
01:30:20,985 --> 01:30:23,647
Look! Money!
All right?

1294
01:30:23,754 --> 01:30:25,984
- Get right in.
- Wait a minute.

1295
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:27,648
Taxi!

1296
01:31:41,499 --> 01:31:45,697
So, he could be on top
of the Empire State Building now.

1297
01:31:48,372 --> 01:31:50,397
I guess he could be.

1298
01:31:53,077 --> 01:31:55,477
It's not him, Walter.
It's me.

1299
01:31:57,114 --> 01:31:59,014
I can't do this.

1300
01:32:00,751 --> 01:32:03,345
Look, Annie...

1301
01:32:03,454 --> 01:32:07,117
I love you,
but let's leave that outta this.

1302
01:32:08,426 --> 01:32:11,293
I don't wanna be someone
that you're settling for.

1303
01:32:11,395 --> 01:32:15,229
I don't wanna be someone
that anyone settles for.

1304
01:32:16,901 --> 01:32:18,801
Marriage is hard enough...

1305
01:32:18,903 --> 01:32:22,600
without bringing such
low expectations into it.

1306
01:32:22,707 --> 01:32:24,106
Isn't it?

1307
01:32:25,042 --> 01:32:27,476
Walter, I don't deserve you.

1308
01:32:28,379 --> 01:32:30,779
I wouldn't put it that way.

1309
01:32:32,316 --> 01:32:34,648
But, okay.

1310
01:32:50,868 --> 01:32:52,096
You okay?

1311
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:54,833
Yeah.

1312
01:33:00,144 --> 01:33:02,135
- What?
- Look.

1313
01:33:10,888 --> 01:33:13,914
<i>- It's a sign.
- Who needed a sign?</i>

1314
01:33:17,328 --> 01:33:18,989
I have to go.

1315
01:33:53,998 --> 01:33:58,298
<i>What if something had happened to you?
What if I couldn't get to you?</i>

1316
01:33:58,402 --> 01:34:01,166
I'm sorry.

1317
01:34:02,973 --> 01:34:05,464
What would I have done?

1318
01:34:05,576 --> 01:34:08,841
You are my family.
You're all I've got.

1319
01:34:08,946 --> 01:34:11,471
I thought she'd be here.
I thought she'd come.

1320
01:34:11,582 --> 01:34:14,142
We're doin' okay, aren't we?
Aren't we all right?

1321
01:34:14,251 --> 01:34:17,084
- Have I done anything really stupid?
- No.

1322
01:34:17,188 --> 01:34:19,656
- Have I screwed it up for both of us?
- No.

1323
01:35:13,377 --> 01:35:16,744
<i>- Observation deck?
- Sorry, ma'am, but it's too late.</i>

1324
01:35:18,015 --> 01:35:20,176
Please. I really need
to get up there.

1325
01:35:20,284 --> 01:35:22,684
We're closing up.
No more runs tonight.

1326
01:35:28,426 --> 01:35:30,656
Listen.

1327
01:35:30,761 --> 01:35:34,288
<i>Can I just take a look?
There's someone I was supposed to meet.</i>

1328
01:35:34,398 --> 01:35:36,992
He's probably not there,
but if I don't at least look...

1329
01:35:37,101 --> 01:35:39,501
I'll always wonder about it.

1330
01:35:39,603 --> 01:35:41,503
Cary Grant, right?

1331
01:35:41,605 --> 01:35:43,869
You know that movie?

1332
01:35:43,974 --> 01:35:46,204
One of my wife's favorites.

1333
01:35:54,985 --> 01:35:58,113
<i>Maybe when we get home
we'll get a dog.</i>

1334
01:35:58,222 --> 01:36:01,487
- Okay.
- What do you mean "okay"?

1335
01:36:01,592 --> 01:36:04,720
- Wouldn't you like to have a dog?
- Sure.

1336
01:36:17,541 --> 01:36:20,169
I'm sorry, ma'am. Empty.

1337
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:25,513
Can I take a minute?

1338
01:36:25,616 --> 01:36:27,174
Go ahead.

1339
01:37:41,058 --> 01:37:43,185
I left it by the telescopes.

1340
01:38:10,087 --> 01:38:12,385
- It's you.
- It's me.

1341
01:38:12,489 --> 01:38:16,289
- I saw you in the street.
- Are you Annie?

1342
01:38:18,295 --> 01:38:20,126
Yes.

1343
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,797
You're Annie?

1344
01:38:27,538 --> 01:38:29,529
This must be yours.

1345
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:32,837
I'm Jonah.
This is my dad.

1346
01:38:32,943 --> 01:38:34,843
- His name's Sam.
- Hi, Jonah.

1347
01:38:43,854 --> 01:38:45,913
- And who's this?
- Howard.

1348
01:38:46,023 --> 01:38:48,753
Oh, Howard.
Hello, Howard.

1349
01:39:04,208 --> 01:39:05,436
We better go.

1350
01:39:13,283 --> 01:39:15,183
Shall we?

1351
01:39:46,650 --> 01:39:50,848
<i>It's so important
to make someone happy</i>

1352
01:39:50,954 --> 01:39:55,050
<i>Make just one someone happy</i>

1353
01:39:55,159 --> 01:40:00,096
<i>Make just one heart
the heart you</i>

1354
01:40:00,197 --> 01:40:02,688
<i>- You sing to
- Sam.</i>

1355
01:40:04,034 --> 01:40:06,229
It's nice to meet you.

1356
01:40:07,504 --> 01:40:11,565
<i>One face that lights
when it nears you</i>

1357
01:40:11,675 --> 01:40:14,109
<i>One girl you're</i>

1358
01:40:14,211 --> 01:40:19,274
<i>You're everything to</i>

1359
01:40:19,383 --> 01:40:21,943
<i>Fame</i>

1360
