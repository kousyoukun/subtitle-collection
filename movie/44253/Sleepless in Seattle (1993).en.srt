Mummy got sick.[br]It happened just like that.

00:00:45.34,00:00:48.67
Nobody could stop it.

00:00:48.84,00:00:52.62
It isn't fair.[br]There's no reason.

00:00:52.80,00:00:58.51
And if we start asking why,[br]we'll go crazy.

00:01:20.87,00:01:25.79
Five minutes in the microwave.[br]Any one of them.

00:01:27.72,00:01:31.08
Do you know how to make juice?

00:01:33.60,00:01:37.59
Microwave. Five minutes.

00:01:53.41,00:01:57.90
Here. It's my shrink.[br]Call him.

00:02:06.97,00:02:11.13
Loss of Spouse Support Group.

00:02:11.30,00:02:16.76

00:02:16.94,00:02:21.32
"Hug Yourself",[br]"Hug a Friend", "Hug a Shrink"... 

00:02:21.48,00:02:27.41
Work hard, that'll save you.[br]Only work will see you through this.

00:02:32.45,00:02:37.66
Don't mind him.[br]he's just a guy who's lost his wife.

00:02:41.75,00:02:46.00
What I think we really need is... [br]change.

00:02:46.18,00:02:51.60
Good idea. Take a few weeks off.[br]take Jonah fishing.

00:02:53.39,00:02:57.80
No, real change.[br]A new city.

00:02:58.86,00:03:03.89
Some place where I don't think[br]of Maggie at every corner.

00:03:11.62,00:03:15.03
Where are you gonna go?

00:03:17.17,00:03:20.25
I was thinking about Seattle.

00:03:21.09,00:03:26.08
In a few months, you'll be seeing[br]women. You'll meet someone.

00:03:26.26,00:03:33.39
Move on. fine. that's what I'll do.[br]I'll just grow a new heart.

00:03:33.56,00:03:39.48
- Sam, I'm sorry, I didn't mean... [br]- I know. But it can't happen twice.

00:05:29.10,00:05:34.22
- The tall redhead is cousin Irene.[br]- You'll see her disappointed look.

00:05:34.40,00:05:41.20
- Harold ran off with the secretary.[br]- Until Irene had the dog put down.

00:05:41.37,00:05:46.19
Your brother Dennis[br]is professor at Johns Hopkins.

00:05:46.37,00:05:51.99
- He's married to... Betsy.[br]- The most competitive woman ever.

00:05:52.17,00:05:56.66
- How will I remember all this?[br]- Walter, you will!

00:06:08.77,00:06:13.27
- Uncle Milton lost all his money.[br]- And some other people's.

00:06:13.44,00:06:18.02
... in a pyramid scheme. Don't[br]mention the IRS or the prisons.

00:06:18.20,00:06:21.57
Your mother's Barbara.[br]your father's Cliff... 

00:06:21.74,00:06:25.61
- He has electric trains.[br]- Really?

00:06:25.79,00:06:33.12
- Am I what they had in mind?[br]- Walter, they're gonna love you!

00:06:35.63,00:06:40.71
Everybody... [br]Annie has an announcement.

00:06:40.89,00:06:44.63
Walter and I are engaged.

00:07:02.54,00:07:04.65
Bless you!

00:07:06.29,00:07:11.33
- Are you all right?[br]- Maybe it's the flowers.

00:07:11.51,00:07:15.83
- We'll move them.[br]- No! I feel terrible, sneezing now.

00:07:16.01,00:07:21.09
- This is a very important moment.[br]- He's just allergic to everything.

00:07:21.27,00:07:24.76
Bees.[br]I'm allergic to bees.

00:07:24.94,00:07:30.69
He's allergic to all bees. We[br]have to take adrenalin with us.

00:07:30.86,00:07:37.31
- If he eats just a bit of a nut... [br]- My head swells, and I drop dead.

00:07:37.49,00:07:41.70
- It's the same with him and bees.[br]- We had salmon at our wedding... 

00:07:41.87,00:07:47.66
- A wedding without salmon is... [br]- I'm not allergic to salmon.

00:07:47.84,00:07:50.33
But you never know.

00:07:50.51,00:07:54.64
- You never know.[br]- He wasn't always allergic to bees.

00:07:54.80,00:08:02.10
- What did we do with our champagne?[br]- Uncle Milton's parole.

00:08:02.27,00:08:07.51
- When are you getting married?[br]- Early June, in the garden.

00:08:07.69,00:08:14.69
- What about Harold and bees?[br]- I'm allergic to bees.

00:08:14.87,00:08:18.57
Cold salmon. cucumber salad.[br]strawberries... 

00:08:18.75,00:08:23.91
I'm afraid I am allergic[br]to strawberries.

00:08:25.09,00:08:28.20
Is this all right with you?

00:08:28.38,00:08:34.22
I'm the luckiest man-man-man on[br]the face of the earth-earth-earth.

00:08:34.39,00:08:40.42
- That's Lou Gehrig's line from... [br]- "Pride of the Yankees".

00:08:40.60,00:08:45.35
- "Pride of the Yankees"![br]- Baseball. An historical reference.

00:08:45.52,00:08:50.27
I would like to propose a toast.[br]To my kid sister!

00:08:50.45,00:08:54.40
To Walter and my baby.

00:08:57.79,00:09:01.61
Please eat, before it gets cold.

00:09:04.21,00:09:10.17
Here it is. I wouldn't[br]give it to the Historical Society.

00:09:10.34,00:09:15.09
- Oh. Mum... [br]- These things are back in fashion.

00:09:15.26,00:09:18.44
Grandmother's dress.

00:09:19.60,00:09:25.56
- He's a lovely man, Annie.[br]- He is. isn't he?

00:09:25.82,00:09:32.40
And he's a wonderful athlete. We're[br]going to DC to see his parents.

00:09:32.58,00:09:36.70
- How did it happen?[br]- It's silly, really.

00:09:36.87,00:09:42.03
I'd seen him at the office.[br]He's the associate publisher.

00:09:42.21,00:09:45.87
We had both ordered sandwiches. -

00:09:46.05,00:09:50.21
- and he got my tomato on wheat,[br]which he's allergic to, -

00:09:50.39,00:09:54.85
- and I got his tomato on white.[br]Amazing, isn't it?

00:09:55.02,00:10:00.01
You make a million decisions.[br]and a sandwich changes your life.

00:10:00.19,00:10:02.94
Destiny takes a hand.

00:10:03.11,00:10:08.81
We invented destiny, because we[br]don't want things to be accidental.

00:10:08.99,00:10:14.11
Then why did you order the same[br]sandwich except for the bread?

00:10:14.29,00:10:21.25
How many people like tomato[br]without something else, like tuna?

00:10:21.46,00:10:25.33
It wasn't a sign.[br]It was a coincidence.

00:10:25.51,00:10:29.80
I was in Atlantic City,[br]where Cliff was a waiter.

00:10:29.97,00:10:34.43
He wasn't supposed to work[br]that night. What if he hadn't?

00:10:34.60,00:10:42.43
He asked me to take a midnight walk.[br]I told you this a million times.

00:10:42.61,00:10:50.82
He held my hand. I looked down[br]and couldn't tell our fingers apart.

00:10:50.99,00:10:55.57
- And I knew.[br]- What?

00:10:57.29,00:11:02.91
- What?[br]- It was magic.

00:11:05.01,00:11:12.14
I knew we'd be together forever.[br]Just like you and Walter.

00:11:12.31,00:11:16.69
Walter... It's quite a formal name.

00:11:17.44,00:11:23.60
I knew that your father and I would[br]have a wonderful time in the... 

00:11:23.78,00:11:27.27
... sack, I believe you call it.

00:11:27.45,00:11:33.74
It took years before it worked[br]like clockwork. It takes time.

00:11:33.92,00:11:39.04
- We already... [br]- Fine, fine. How's it working?

00:11:39.21,00:11:44.25
- Like clockwork.[br]- Oh, honey... 

00:11:46.55,00:11:51.34
- It's a sign.[br]- You don't believe in signs.

00:11:56.15,00:12:00.44
They loved you.[br]I told you they would.

00:12:00.61,00:12:03.98
- I love you.[br]- I love you, Walter.

00:12:05.83,00:12:11.07
Did anyone ever call you[br]anything other than Walter?

00:12:11.25,00:12:17.62
- Not even when you were young?[br]- Not even when I was young.

00:12:17.80,00:12:22.50
- Don't you want to drive with me?[br]- Then I can't get back on Friday.

00:12:22.68,00:12:28.60
I forgot your stepmother's present.[br]When we're old and grey -

00:12:28.77,00:12:34.97
- you must remind me to put my teeth[br]in, so I don't go out without them.

00:12:35.15,00:12:38.07
I'll wait.

00:12:38.24,00:12:43.52
No, go ahead. We're late anyway.[br]I'll be ten minutes behind you.

00:13:14.02,00:13:16.86
Welcome to "You and Emotions".

00:13:17.03,00:13:22.73
I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone,[br]broadcasting live from Chicago.

00:13:22.91,00:13:28.75
Tonight we'll talk about wishes.[br]What's your wish this Christmas?

00:13:28.92,00:13:33.62
My wish is to change the station.

00:13:33.80,00:13:39.04
- And now: "You and your spleen".[br]- Not on your life.

00:13:39.22,00:13:43.96
Coming up, "'Jingle bells" backwards ,[br]sung by... 

00:13:44.14,00:13:48.30
- Seattle, go ahead.[br]- This is 'Jonah... 

00:13:48.48,00:13:53.18
No last names, 'Jonah.[br]How old are you?

00:13:53.36,00:13:56.39
- I'm eight.[br]- You're up late.

00:13:56.57,00:14:02.27
- It's not so late in Seattle.[br]- You're right. What's your wish?

00:14:02.45,00:14:08.12
- My dad needs a new wife.[br]- You don't like the one he has?

00:14:08.29,00:14:12.29
- He doesn't have one.[br]- Where's your mum?

00:14:12.46,00:14:18.14
- She died.[br]- Well. who can believe this?

00:14:18.30,00:14:24.09
- I've been sad, but Dad's worse.[br]- Have you talked to him about it?.

00:14:24.27,00:14:29.69
No, that makes him sadder.

00:14:29.86,00:14:32.56
'Jonah, is your dad home?

00:14:32.73,00:14:37.40
- Is he busy?[br]- No, he's out on the deck.

00:14:37.57,00:14:40.74
Can't you ask him to talk to me?

00:14:40.91,00:14:46.78
- Wretched woman! Hang up, Jonah![br]- No, he'd kill me.

00:14:46.96,00:14:51.79
He won't be angry when he hears[br]how concerned you are about him.

00:14:51.96,00:14:57.21
- Want to bet?[br]- If he yells, you lose a fan.

00:14:59.35,00:15:05.05
Dad. there's someone[br]on the phone for you.

00:15:08.07,00:15:10.60
His name is Sam.

00:15:10.78,00:15:16.40
If you've just tuned in, tonight's[br]topic is wishes and dreams.

00:15:16.57,00:15:20.07
We have a listener from Seattle.

00:15:20.24,00:15:23.99
Sam, this is Dr. Fieldstone[br]on Network America.

00:15:24.17,00:15:29.41
What are you selling?[br]Micro-hibachis or knives?

00:15:29.59,00:15:34.75
Neither. I want to help.[br]Your son asked me for advice.

00:15:34.93,00:15:40.05
- He wants to find you a new wife.[br]- Who is this?

00:15:40.22,00:15:45.85
Dr. Fieldstone of Network America.[br]You are on the air.

00:15:46.02,00:15:50.35
- You called a radio station?[br]- Sam, are you there?

00:15:50.53,00:15:56.37
- Yes.[br]- You mourn your wife's death.

00:15:56.53,00:16:00.03
Your son is worried about you.

00:16:00.21,00:16:04.78
Get out here.[br]I won't go through this alone.

00:16:04.96,00:16:09.12
It's hard for him[br]to talk to you about this.

00:16:09.30,00:16:14.04
If we talk about it,[br]maybe 'Jonah will feel better.

00:16:14.22,00:16:19.47
- Talk to her. She's a doctor.[br]- Her first name could be Doctor.

00:16:19.64,00:16:26.64
- Please.[br]- Sam, it's his Christmas wish.

00:16:26.82,00:16:29.52
- Okay.[br]- Good.

00:16:29.70,00:16:34.94
I know this is difficult.[br]When did your wife die?

00:16:35.99,00:16:41.53
- About a year and a half ago.[br]- Have you had any relationships?

00:16:42.38,00:16:46.76
- No.[br]- Why not?.

00:16:48.67,00:16:52.58
- Marcia... or Dr. Fieldstone?[br]- Dr. Marcia.

00:16:52.76,00:16:58.93
- I don't mean to be rude... [br]- I don't want to pry... 

00:16:59.10,00:17:06.47
- Sure you do.[br]- Go on, Sam. I'm listening.

00:17:06.65,00:17:11.90
We had a pretty tough time at first.

00:17:12.07,00:17:16.37
But we're dealing with it.

00:17:16.54,00:17:22.74
Jonah and I will get along fine,[br]as soon as I break his radio.

00:17:24.25,00:17:27.46
I'm sure you're a wonderful father.

00:17:27.63,00:17:31.54
- You can tell a lot from a voice.[br]- Yes, you can.

00:17:31.72,00:17:35.97
But 'Jonah still feels[br]that you're under a cloud.

00:17:36.14,00:17:41.51
- Are you sleeping at night?.[br]- He doesn't sleep at all.

00:17:41.69,00:17:45.93
- How do you know that?[br]- I live here. Dad.

00:17:47.91,00:17:51.48
Look. it's Christmas.

00:17:55.33,00:17:59.03
Maggie... my wife.

00:17:59.21,00:18:02.21
She really did it... 

00:18:02.38,00:18:07.04
She loved... [br]She made everything beautiful.

00:18:09.18,00:18:13.01
It's tough this time of year.

00:18:13.18,00:18:20.43
- Every kid needs a mother.[br]- Maybe you need someone, too.

00:18:22.65,00:18:27.35
- Yes.[br]- We'll resume after these messages.

00:18:27.53,00:18:34.07
Sam and 'Jonah, don't go away.[br]I'm talking to Sleepless in Seattle.

00:18:34.25,00:18:38.24
We'll be back[br]with listener response.

00:18:38.42,00:18:44.87
- What's that?[br]- People call in and dump on you.

00:18:45.05,00:18:48.92
This is really fun. And helpful.

00:18:54.98,00:19:00.77
- I bet he's tall with a cute butt.[br]- I bet he hasn't bathed in weeks.

00:19:00.94,00:19:03.98
- Yes?[br]- Tea, with the bag out.

00:19:04.15,00:19:11.32
- Maybe I'll just go up to Seattle.[br]- Don't open his refrigerator.

00:19:11.50,00:19:16.92
Men don't cover food, and they[br]leave it in there till it walks out.

00:19:17.09,00:19:22.42
I wouldn't kick him out of bed[br]for eating crackers. 65 cents.

00:19:22.59,00:19:29.31
We'll take a call before we talk to[br]Sleepless. Go ahead, Tennessee.

00:19:29.52,00:19:34.15
I'd like to have his address.

00:19:34.31,00:19:38.18
Honey, get in line.

00:19:39.36,00:19:44.65
- If I could ask you a question... [br]- Go ahead.

00:19:44.82,00:19:48.95
People who truly loved[br]are likely to love again.

00:19:49.12,00:19:55.45
Sam, could you love anybody[br]as much as you loved your wife?

00:19:56.59,00:20:00.88
Well, that's hard to imagine.

00:20:01.05,00:20:04.17
What are you going to do?

00:20:04.35,00:20:11.56
Get out of bed every morning[br]and breathe in and out all day.

00:20:11.73,00:20:19.90
And after a while I won't have to[br]remind myself to do it.

00:20:22.16,00:20:29.95
And then after a while I won't[br]remember how perfect things were.

00:20:30.17,00:20:34.41
Why was your wife so special?

00:20:34.59,00:20:38.04
How long is your program?

00:20:40.55,00:20:44.96
It was a million little things.

00:20:45.14,00:20:49.80
When you added them up, it meant[br]we were meant for each other.

00:20:49.98,00:20:54.36
I knew it[br]the very first time I touched her.

00:20:54.52,00:21:00.45
It was like coming home,[br]only to no home I'd ever known.

00:21:00.61,00:21:03.90
I was just taking her hand -

00:21:04.08,00:21:08.71
- to help her out of a car.[br]And I knew it.

00:21:10.00,00:21:14.55
- It was... Like magic.[br]- Magic.

00:21:15.34,00:21:21.04
It's time to wrap it up.[br]I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone.

00:21:21.22,00:21:25.55
To all my listeners,[br]a magical and Merry Christmas.

00:21:25.73,00:21:32.97
And Sleepless in Seattle,[br]call and tell us how it's going.

00:21:33.15,00:21:36.18
You can count on it.

00:22:24.37,00:22:29.24
He sells the best soup ever and[br]he is the meanest man in America.

00:22:29.42,00:22:34.08
- I feel strongly about this.[br]- Do it.

00:22:34.26,00:22:36.83
New Year's Eve. I won't write it.

00:22:37.01,00:22:41.26
Listen: "Phone service was[br]tied up Christmas Eve -

00:22:41.43,00:22:45.76
- when a kid called the radio[br]and said his dad needs a new wife."

00:22:45.94,00:22:49.64
2.000 women wanted his number.

00:22:49.82,00:22:53.02
I heard it. This kid calls up, -

00:22:53.20,00:22:59.28
- and the shrink forces[br]the father to talk about it.

00:22:59.45,00:23:02.57
Suddenly he starts talking -

00:23:02.75,00:23:09.16
- about how he fell in love with her[br]like these cows in Michigan.

00:23:09.34,00:23:14.84
The cows that got zapped by stray[br]voltage. Maybe it was Wisconsin.

00:23:15.01,00:23:21.47
Anyway, I was listening to him,[br]and suddenly I was crying.

00:23:21.64,00:23:24.81
Like when I see the ad -

00:23:24.98,00:23:29.93
- where the daughter gives her mum[br]the refrigerator with a red bow.

00:23:30.11,00:23:35.73
- Or the to kids at the party... [br]- Making an album for Grandfather!

00:23:35.91,00:23:39.49
That kills me!

00:23:39.66,00:23:43.36
Write about it. Whatever it is.

00:23:43.54,00:23:49.33
2,000 women calling for a husband?[br]Women are desperate for love.

00:23:49.51,00:23:54.75
- It's hard to get married over 40.

00:23:54.93,00:23:59.80
- That statistic is not true.[br]- But it feels true.

00:23:59.98,00:24:05.40
- It's true.[br]- A new book proves it isn't true.

00:24:05.57,00:24:09.89
- Did you read that book?[br]- Did anybody read that book?

00:24:10.07,00:24:13.27
Are you done? Where were we?

00:24:13.45,00:24:20.36
If someone's a widower, why is he[br]widowed and not widowered?

00:24:22.17,00:24:24.92
Just wondering.

00:24:25.09,00:24:29.50
What was that about up there?[br]What's with you?

00:24:29.68,00:24:37.47
- Nothing.[br]- There's something. Tell me.

00:24:37.64,00:24:41.72
- Sleepless in Seattle?[br]- That's what she called him.

00:24:41.90,00:24:46.19
Now 2.000 women want his number.[br]He could be a crack head. -

00:24:46.36,00:24:53.94
- a transvestite, a junkie,[br]or really sick, like my Rick.

00:24:55.29,00:24:58.70
Actually, he sounded nice.

00:24:59.87,00:25:04.95
Really?[br]Now we're getting down to it.

00:25:05.13,00:25:10.42
I'm madly in love with Walter. He[br]did a crazy thing the other night.

00:25:12.47,00:25:18.31
It was so funny.[br]What was that?

00:25:27.91,00:25:32.98
I've got to go to Boston[br]for the convention.

00:25:33.16,00:25:37.15
And I have to visit Winston-Hughes.

00:25:37.75,00:25:41.99
Why don't we meet in New York[br]for Valentine's Day weekend?

00:25:42.17,00:25:47.62
- Walter. I'd love to![br]- We can stay at the Plaza.

00:25:48.22,00:25:54.59
- Ice skate in Central Park.[br]- Register.

00:25:54.77,00:25:59.68
You know... for dishes.[br]glasses, silver, everything.

00:26:02.44,00:26:04.81
How about it?

00:26:06.61,00:26:11.16
- We'll have dim sum in Chinatown.[br]- Is there wheat in it?

00:26:11.33,00:26:15.07
I don't think so.

00:26:21.51,00:26:25.89
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, -

00:26:26.05,00:26:30.30
- five. four. three. to. one... 

00:26:30.47,00:26:34.77
Jonah, wake up.[br]The ball's dropping.

00:27:23.11,00:27:27.27
- Happy New Year.[br]- Happy New Year.

00:27:30.91,00:27:35.07
- Kiss Howard.[br]- Goodnight, Howard.

00:29:07.60,00:29:10.86
Can I have half your beer?

00:29:11.02,00:29:15.24
Go ahead.

00:29:15.40,00:29:20.61
What did I use to say?[br]"Here's looking at you"?

00:29:20.78,00:29:24.91
-"Here's mud in your eye"?[br]-"Here's to us."

00:29:25.08,00:29:28.91
You used to say: "Here's to us."

00:29:32.92,00:29:37.13
Oh. babe.[br]I miss you so much it hurts.

00:29:54.61,00:29:54.65
You want to tell him? I'll tell him.

00:29:54.65,00:29:58.81
You want to tell him? I'll tell him.

00:29:58.99,00:30:02.61
She's back with another idea.

00:30:02.79,00:30:08.66
Sam, I'm glad you're here. I heard[br]you on the radio. I told everyone.

00:30:08.84,00:30:13.71
- We already knew. From Grace.[br]- Then all of Seattle knows.

00:30:13.88,00:30:19.31
I was brushing my teeth and there[br]you were. I called my mother.

00:30:19.47,00:30:24.38
I said. "Turn on the radio.[br]That's my architect."

00:30:24.56,00:30:30.64
You know. it's so nice[br]when a man can express his feelings.

00:30:30.82,00:30:34.95
- I wish I could.[br]- Claire, is there a problem?

00:30:35.11,00:30:39.24
I couldn't sleep last night.[br]You know what that's like.

00:30:39.41,00:30:44.36
My platters[br]won't fit in the refrigerator.

00:30:44.54,00:30:50.08
At parties I use platters, so I want[br]a Sub Zero refrigerator instead.

00:30:50.26,00:30:55.13
- We have to redo the cabinets.[br]- We'll be into this wall.

00:30:55.30,00:31:00.46
- A bearing wall.[br]- That's a delay of five, six... 

00:31:00.64,00:31:06.51
- 12 weeks.[br]- It's important to get it right.

00:31:06.69,00:31:11.27
Well. la decorateur calls.[br]Bye.

00:31:15.32,00:31:19.95
It's fate. She's divorced. we don't[br]want to do this and you need a wife.

00:31:20.12,00:31:24.62
- Everything intersects.[br]- Like the Bermuda Triangle.

00:31:34.26,00:31:40.02
Here's one more. Do you have room?

00:31:40.18,00:31:44.60
- Dad, they're all for you.[br]- Here you go.

00:31:47.32,00:31:50.07
"Sleepless in Seattle".

00:31:50.24,00:31:54.98
If you can't sleep, try drinking a[br]glass of water from the other side.

00:31:55.16,00:32:01.96
That's for hiccups. Or you can hold[br]a spoonful of sugar in your mouth.

00:32:02.79,00:32:05.16
Thank you.

00:32:05.34,00:32:11.34
- But why give them our address? - They called and asked for it.

00:32:11.51,00:32:17.76
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are[br]the most attractive man I've heard."

00:32:17.93,00:32:22.72
They called?[br]You gave them our number, too?

00:32:22.90,00:32:25.93
You have to, to get on the air.

00:32:26.11,00:32:29.85
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle.[br]I live in Tulsa." Where's that?

00:32:30.03,00:32:35.19
- In Oklahoma. Where is that?[br]- Somewhere in the middle.

00:32:35.37,00:32:40.57
I won't think about[br]what they don't teach you at school.

00:32:40.75,00:32:46.29
I think we should rule out[br]anyone who doesn't live near here.

00:32:46.47,00:32:50.51
She's willing to fly anywhere.

00:32:50.68,00:32:56.88
Looks like my third-grade teacher.[br]She is my third-grade teacher!

00:32:57.64,00:33:02.47
- Don't you want to read these?[br]- No. it's not how it's done.

00:33:02.65,00:33:06.89
I'd rather see somebody I like.

00:33:07.07,00:33:12.36
- Then I'd ask her out for a drink.[br]- Or a slice of pizza.

00:33:12.54,00:33:18.21
No dinner on the first date. because[br]halfway through you could regret it.

00:33:18.38,00:33:22.67
But if you like them after a drink,[br]you can always ask them to dinner.

00:33:22.84,00:33:26.97
If not, you can say,[br]"That was great," and go home.

00:33:27.13,00:33:32.30
You see? I wonder[br]if it still works this way.

00:33:32.47,00:33:36.69
- It doesn't. They ask you.[br]- I'm starting to notice that.

00:33:36.85,00:33:41.35
If you get a new wife,[br]you'll have sex with her, huh?

00:33:41.53,00:33:47.73
- I certainly hope so.[br]- Will she scratch up your back?

00:33:47.91,00:33:53.33
In movies women always scratch the[br]man's back and scream during sex.

00:33:53.50,00:33:59.12
- How do you know this?[br]- Jed's got cable.

00:34:00.42,00:34:04.00
Hand me that towel, please.

00:34:07.68,00:34:13.47
Thank you. Let me get you.[br]"Jed's got cable!"

00:35:41.57,00:35:47.11
Now to Dr. Fieldstone, psychologist[br]and the friend you never have.

00:35:47.29,00:35:51.33
- Remember Marooned in Miami?[br]- He doesn't love me anymore.

00:35:51.50,00:35:56.08
- Then why stay with him?[br]- Disappointed in Denver.

00:35:56.25,00:36:00.50
When I come close to orgasm,[br]he goes to make a sandwich.

00:36:00.68,00:36:04.67
- Make a sandwich beforehand.[br]- Sleepless in Seattle.

00:36:04.85,00:36:13.11
I'll get up every morning[br]and breathe all day long.

00:36:13.82,00:36:18.39
After a while I won't have to[br]remind myself-

00:36:18.57,00:36:23.15
- to get up and breathe in and out.

00:36:25.04,00:36:29.99
Then after a while I won't[br]have to think about-

00:36:30.17,00:36:34.33
- howl had it great and perfect[br]for a while.

00:36:34.50,00:36:38.00
Why was your wife so special?

00:36:38.88,00:36:43.59
How long is your program?

00:36:43.76,00:36:49.69
It was a million little things.

00:36:49.85,00:36:54.48
When you added them up, it meant[br]we were meant for each other.

00:36:54.65,00:36:59.35
I knew it,[br]the first time I touched her.

00:36:59.53,00:37:04.95
It was like coming home,[br]only to no home I'd ever known.

00:37:05.12,00:37:11.33
I was just taking her hand[br]to help her out of a car.

00:37:11.50,00:37:16.71
And I knew it.[br]It was like... 

00:37:16.88,00:37:20.50
... magic.

00:37:40.08,00:37:44.62
I think I'm going crazy, Dennis.[br]Are you happily married?

00:37:44.79,00:37:49.62
Why did you get married?[br]Was it trumpets and fireworks?

00:37:49.79,00:37:54.66
Betsy said we had to break up[br]or get married. That's why.

00:37:55.55,00:37:59.71
When you met, did you think[br]she was the only one for you?

00:37:59.89,00:38:03.01
That in some way it was fated?

00:38:03.18,00:38:06.97
Annie. attraction is -

00:38:07.15,00:38:12.18
- when your subconscious is[br]attracted to their subconscious.

00:38:12.36,00:38:17.52
Fate is to neuroses[br]knowing they're a perfect match.

00:38:17.70,00:38:23.82
I'm having all these fantasies[br]about a man I never even met!

00:38:24.00,00:38:28.13
- And he lives in Seattle![br]- It rains nine months a year there.

00:38:28.30,00:38:33.29
I know. I won't move to Seattle.

00:38:36.10,00:38:42.47
But I don't want to end up wondering[br]what might have happened.

00:38:42.64,00:38:47.39
What do you think?[br]It's cold feet. isn't it?

00:38:47.57,00:38:52.06
- Everybody panics. Didn't you?[br]- Yes. I did.

00:38:52.24,00:38:57.99
Thanks. Dennis. I feel better now.

00:38:58.58,00:39:04.03
Sandy's friend is a weightlifter,[br]but her neck isn't that big.

00:39:04.21,00:39:11.29
No, don't set me up. I want to know[br]what it's like out there.

00:39:11.47,00:39:16.55
Women are looking[br]for pecs and a cute butt.

00:39:16.72,00:39:20.94
"He has the cutest butt."[br]Where did I hear that recently?

00:39:21.10,00:39:27.85
Everywhere. Even on the news[br]women talk about cute butts.

00:39:28.03,00:39:31.48
It's really caught on.

00:39:31.66,00:39:35.19
So how's my butt?

00:39:36.33,00:39:39.66
- Not bad.[br]- Is it cute though?

00:39:39.83,00:39:42.24
Are we grading on a curve?

00:39:43.46,00:39:47.84
When was your last date?

00:39:49.17,00:39:53.13
Jimmy Carter... 1978.

00:39:53.30,00:39:59.06
Things are different now.[br]First you have to be friends.

00:39:59.23,00:40:03.05
Then you neck.[br]This could go on for years.

00:40:03.23,00:40:07.78
Then you have tests and do it with a[br]condom. But you do split the check.

00:40:08.70,00:40:13.77
- I can't let a woman pay.[br]- They'll throw a parade for you.

00:40:13.95,00:40:18.11
You'll be Man of the Year.

00:40:18.29,00:40:23.33
Tira misu.[br]You'll find out what that is.

00:40:23.50,00:40:27.91
Some woman will want me to do it[br]to her. and I won't know what it is.

00:40:28.09,00:40:35.22
- You'll love it.[br]- This is going to be tough.

00:40:35.39,00:40:41.85
What about that decorator?[br]She's perky.

00:40:42.02,00:40:48.52
No. I'm far away from that.[br]I'm just making notes.

00:40:48.70,00:40:53.86
- How would I do it?[br]- Ask her over to look at swatches.

00:40:54.04,00:40:58.95
- To look at swatches?[br]- Yeah. colour schemes.

00:40:59.13,00:41:04.91
Don't do it like I did. Be suave.[br]Think Cary Grant. 

00:41:05.09,00:41:09.33
Would he say,[br]"Come look at my swatches"?

00:41:09.51,00:41:14.47
- Not it in movies... [br]- Not in "Gunga Din"?

00:41:14.64,00:41:19.19
"Gunga Din" isn't that kind of film.[br]Who knows what he did in real life.

00:41:19.36,00:41:24.70
- He did that with Dyan Cannon?[br]- "Dyan, look at these swatches."

00:41:43.30,00:41:45.87
Jonah. I'm home!

00:41:48.60,00:41:51.09
Jonah?

00:42:09.12,00:42:12.40
Hi. Dad. This is Jessica.

00:42:12.58,00:42:15.92
Nice to meet you.

00:42:16.08,00:42:21.04
This is amazing. If you play this[br]backwards, it says "Paul is dead."

00:42:21.21,00:42:26.75
- Yeah. I know.[br]- How do you know?

00:42:27.76,00:42:32.43
- Dad, could you shut the door?[br]- Sure.

00:42:32.60,00:42:38.36
H and G.[br]Hi and goodbye.

00:43:51.10,00:43:54.06
Hello. Victoria?

00:43:54.23,00:43:59.69
This is Sam Baldwin.[br]I don't know if you remember me... 

00:43:59.86,00:44:03.82
Oh, great.

00:44:03.99,00:44:10.82
I was wondering if you would like[br]to have a drink with me?

00:44:11.00,00:44:13.45
Dinner?

00:44:13.63,00:44:17.29
Dinner would be even better.

00:44:17.47,00:44:20.92
Friday would be great.

00:44:21.10,00:44:24.80
I hear that's a good place.

00:44:26.02,00:44:30.65
Seven-thirty is fine. And I'll... 

00:44:32.61,00:44:36.74
Okay, I'll meet you there.

00:44:36.90,00:44:43.36
So it's Friday[br]at seven-thirty for dinner. Great.

00:44:45.00,00:44:48.49
Me, too. Bye.

00:44:53.84,00:45:00.25
- Are you in love with him?[br]- Not now.

00:45:00.43,00:45:06.35
- Those people knew how to love.[br]- You're a basket case.

00:45:06.52,00:45:12.77
They knew it. Nothing could[br]separate them because they knew.

00:45:12.94,00:45:16.52
- It was real.[br]- It's a movie.

00:45:16.70,00:45:22.37
You don't want to be in love.[br]you want to be in a movie. Read it.

00:45:23.50,00:45:27.82
"Dear Sleepless and Son. I've never[br]written a letter like this before."

00:45:28.00,00:45:33.67
- That's what everyone writes.[br]- You think I don't know that?

00:45:34.51,00:45:37.46
What about Walter?

00:45:37.64,00:45:41.63
I'd give anything to marry Walter.

00:45:41.81,00:45:48.01
He's so unexpected. You think[br]you know him, but you don't.

00:45:48.86,00:45:51.94
I should write about magic.

00:45:52.11,00:45:56.94
What if this man is my destiny,[br]and I never meet him?

00:45:57.12,00:46:01.82
- Your destiny can be your doom.[br]- "I want to meet you... "

00:46:02.00,00:46:06.91
- At the Empire State Building.[br]- At the Empire State Building.

00:46:07.09,00:46:10.62
Sunset, Valentine's Day.

00:46:10.80,00:46:14.93
I'll be in New York with Walter.[br]I can squeeze it in.

00:46:15.09,00:46:18.88
I'll be in New York with Walter!

00:46:25.02,00:46:30.86
Because of fate I married Martin and[br]bought the house with the dead tree.

00:46:31.03,00:46:35.27
On account of which I got divorced[br]and hit a car -

00:46:35.45,00:46:38.86
- and met Rick.[br]while buying a neck brace.

00:46:39.04,00:46:42.66
You got divorced because of a tree?

00:46:42.83,00:46:46.24
- The tree man.[br]- You fell in love with him?

00:46:46.42,00:46:52.46
I did not say love.[br]This is my favourite part.

00:46:53.59,00:46:59.92
- It's now or never.[br]- Never is a frightening word.

00:47:00.10,00:47:04.65
We'd be fools to let[br]happiness pass us by.

00:47:05.86,00:47:10.98
Winter must be cold[br]for those with no warm memories.

00:47:12.28,00:47:16.33
We've already missed the spring.

00:47:17.41,00:47:22.45
- Men never get this movie.[br]- I know.

00:47:23.46,00:47:26.21
Mummy! Mummy!

00:47:28.47,00:47:35.21
- Mummy![br]- It's okay. I'm here. I'm coming.

00:47:37.23,00:47:41.39
It's okay. What was that about?

00:47:41.56,00:47:47.07
Our house was sinking. There was[br]water coming in all the windows.

00:47:48.65,00:47:53.40
Well, it's okay now.

00:47:54.54,00:48:00.74
What shall we do? Your mother sang[br]to when you had bad dreams.

00:48:01.67,00:48:05.45
"Bye Bye Blackbird".

00:48:07.01,00:48:12.09
I miss her. What happens[br]to someone after they die?

00:48:13.60,00:48:18.51
- I don't know.[br]- Do you believe in heaven?

00:48:20.81,00:48:27.56
I never believed in an afterlife.[br]But now. I don't know.

00:48:28.28,00:48:34.65
Because I've had these dreams[br]about your mum.

00:48:35.75,00:48:40.87
We have long talks... about you.

00:48:41.04,00:48:47.33
How you're doing. She sort of[br]knows, but I tell her anyway.

00:48:47.51,00:48:53.96
So what is that?[br]It's sort of an afterlife. isn't it?

00:48:55.02,00:48:59.85
I'm starting to forget her.

00:49:13.04,00:49:17.91
She could peel an apple -

00:49:18.08,00:49:23.33
- in one long, curly strip.

00:49:24.55,00:49:28.68
The whole apple.

00:49:38.73,00:49:44.10
- I love you, Jonah.[br]- I love you, Dad.

00:49:50.16,00:49:53.25
See you tomorrow.

00:51:05.62,00:51:11.46
Laurie? It's Annie.[br]I'm fine.

00:51:11.62,00:51:18.92
I'm writing about radio shows.[br]Do you know Dr. Fieldstone?

00:51:19.09,00:51:24.93
I work for the Baltimore Sun. and[br]I'm doing a piece on bereavement.

00:51:25.10,00:51:29.05
I understand[br]you had a caller from Seattle... 

00:51:37.32,00:51:42.36
This is 'Jonah Baldwin.[br]We're not in right now...

00:52:45.14,00:52:48.64
Architect.

00:53:20.60,00:53:27.01
I'll be back either by midnight[br]or 8:30. if disaster strikes.

00:53:27.19,00:53:31.60
- Here's one for both of us.[br]- "Sleepless and Son, Baltimore."

00:53:31.78,00:53:35.31
Here's the doctor's number.

00:53:35.49,00:53:40.57
Here's a bottle of ipecac[br]if anybody drinks poison.

00:53:40.75,00:53:45.66
How do I look?[br]Do I look all right?

00:53:45.83,00:53:51.34
I look stupid. I'm trying too hard.[br]I was going to get a haircut.

00:53:51.51,00:53:56.29
- This is a good letter, Dad.[br]- These heels are grotesque.

00:53:56.47,00:53:59.51
Her name is Annie Reed.

00:53:59.68,00:54:03.22
Dad. read this.

00:54:04.85,00:54:08.93
"Dear Sleepless and Son... "

00:54:09.11,00:54:13.74
"I'm an excellent third baseman.[br]and let me tell you, -

00:54:13.91,00:54:18.73
- Robinson was the best. We must[br]agree on this. I'm from Baltimore."

00:54:18.91,00:54:24.16
She likes Brooks Robinson.[br]So do you. It's a sign.

00:54:24.33,00:54:28.96
Come here. I'll show you a sign.

00:54:31.68,00:54:37.96
Where's Seattle?[br]And Baltimore? Right there!

00:54:38.14,00:54:43.39
There's like 26 states between[br]here and there. That's a sign.

00:54:43.56,00:54:48.60
I'm out of here. Goodbye.[br]I love you.

00:54:51.53,00:54:56.08
Clarise, did you move your car?

00:55:03.63,00:55:08.71
- Thanks. Derrick. I'll have... [br]- White wine spritzer?

00:55:08.88,00:55:12.29
- And you, sir?[br]- I'm fine.

00:55:12.47,00:55:17.46
- You look good.[br]- So do you.

00:55:20.69,00:55:23.81
I thought you'd never call me.

00:55:23.98,00:55:27.27
I really wanted you to.

00:55:27.44,00:55:33.32
Mr. Baldwin, phone call for you.

00:55:39.96,00:55:45.25
Dad, can we go to New York[br]for Valentine's Day?

00:55:45.42,00:55:51.43
Annie Reed wants to meet us at the[br]top of the Empire State Building.

00:55:51.60,00:55:58.59
Jonah, have you fallen down?[br]Has Clarise been strangled?

00:55:58.77,00:56:01.86
- No.[br]- Is that the reason you're calling?

00:56:02.02,00:56:07.36
We can get cheap tickets[br]from Jessica's parents.

00:56:07.53,00:56:11.77
We'll talk about it later.

00:56:11.95,00:56:17.11
This conversation has lasted[br]too long. Go to bed.

00:56:22.75,00:56:27.13
- Everything all right?[br]- Yes. Do you have kids?

00:56:27.30,00:56:30.50
You want mine?

00:56:31.39,00:56:35.63
I'll have an Absolut straight up.

00:56:52.29,00:56:55.95
Put that down. Stop it!

00:56:56.12,00:57:00.25
- There she is.[br]- Why is she bringing groceries?

00:57:00.42,00:57:05.50
- She's going to cook for us.[br]- Hi. Sam.

00:57:05.68,00:57:09.72
Let me guess. You must be Jonah.

00:57:12.60,00:57:17.06
This is it? The car is this way.

00:57:17.23,00:57:24.14
She's on her sixth painter. And now[br]she wants the fireplace rebricked.

00:57:24.32,00:57:30.86
- I know her. I could call her.[br]- I'll just hit her with a brick.

00:57:33.37,00:57:36.41
That's so funny. You're so funny.

00:57:36.58,00:57:42.62
When she wants something done[br]she says: "You know best."

00:57:42.80,00:57:48.05
"But couldn't we flip the house[br]so the back is in front?"

00:57:48.22,00:57:54.30
"Put the front on a hinge so I can[br]get in with a garage door opener."

00:57:54.48,00:58:00.77
- "Yes, we can. We'll just... "[br]- "Move the cabinets."

00:58:07.95,00:58:11.70
Jonah, bring some of that stuff.

00:58:11.87,00:58:14.91
Do you like baseball?

00:58:15.08,00:58:20.00
Yes. In fact my firm has box seats[br]to the Mariners. Let's go some day.

00:58:21.72,00:58:26.55
What about camping?[br]Do you like that?

00:58:26.72,00:58:29.51
I went camping once.

00:58:29.68,00:58:35.44
- We should go camping more often.[br]- You're right. Time for bed.

00:58:35.61,00:58:40.19
- It's only 10:00.[br]- That's right. Time for bed.

00:58:40.36,00:58:43.37
Goodnight.

00:58:44.99,00:58:48.99
Thank Victoria for the nice dinner.

00:58:49.16,00:58:54.24
Thanks for dinner. I never saw[br]anybody cook potatoes that way.

00:58:54.42,00:59:00.18
I'm glad you liked it.[br]Goodnight, Jonah.

00:59:01.47,00:59:07.42
We don't see a lot of potatoes here.[br]We're rice men.

01:00:00.95,01:00:04.20
I'm sorry, Walter. I'm sorry.

01:00:08.92,01:00:11.53
Turn on your radio.

01:00:11.71,01:00:16.71
The kid is on. You've got me[br]listening to this garbage!

01:00:17.63,01:00:24.72
Becky's having trouble with Rick.[br]Becky, I'll call you back.

01:00:27.56,01:00:32.06
I'm sorry, Walter.[br]Are you bleeding?

01:00:51.25,01:00:54.42
He's kissing her right now!

01:00:54.59,01:00:58.38
Are you spying on your father?.

01:00:58.55,01:01:03.59
- Who is he kissing?[br]- I have to make them stop.

01:01:03.77,01:01:07.90
- How will I explain this to Walter?[br]- She made dinner.

01:01:08.06,01:01:11.27
She brought food for a whole year!

01:01:11.44,01:01:15.94
It's good that your father's dating.[br]It's just hard on you.

01:01:16.12,01:01:20.49
You think you want it,[br]but when it happens, it scares you.

01:01:20.66,01:01:26.12
Shouldn't your father decide[br]whether someone is right for him?

01:01:26.29,01:01:28.58
He's not sane enough.

01:01:28.75,01:01:34.62
He's kissing her on the lips.[br]My dad's been captured by a 'ho!

01:01:34.80,01:01:39.51
Calm down. Tomorrow,[br]when you're having breakfast, -

01:01:39.68,01:01:45.55
- tell him how you feel.[br]Don't keep it inside.

01:01:50.11,01:01:54.69
Miss Scarlett. In the broom closet.[br]With the radio.

01:01:54.87,01:02:00.40
Walter, you scared me.[br]Don't ever do that again.

01:02:03.29,01:02:08.04
- I saw a black widow.[br]- You scared me and Victoria.

01:02:08.21,01:02:13.17
- It was right there.[br]- Next time I want you to say:

01:02:13.34,01:02:17.64
"Dad, I see a poisonous insect."

01:02:17.81,01:02:21.26
And I'll deal with it. Don't scream.

01:02:21.44,01:02:25.93
Becky thought Rick was on the radio.

01:02:26.11,01:02:32.03
It turned out the guy lived[br]in Duluth. Where's Duluth?

01:02:32.20,01:02:36.66
- That doesn't make any sense.[br]- I know. No sense at all.

01:02:36.83,01:02:42.53
- Thank God my life is in place.[br]- Duluth? That's in North Dakota.

01:02:56.89,01:03:01.80
- Great letter. Write to her.[br]- You think so?

01:03:01.98,01:03:07.49
It's Y-O-H.[br]Your only hope.

01:03:19.21,01:03:24.63
I thought I'd do a story[br]on those radio shows.

01:03:24.80,01:03:29.43
- You'd have to go somewhere.[br]- Definitely.

01:03:48.32,01:03:52.70
- Can't you do a phone interview?[br]- No.

01:03:52.87,01:03:57.17
- I won't be in Chicago long.[br]- When you get back, I'll be gone.

01:03:57.33,01:04:01.46
- Then I'll see you in New York.[br]- I'll get it... 

01:04:05.63,01:04:10.71
This is Captain Browning.[br]We're cruising at 35,000 feet.

01:04:10.89,01:04:16.34
The weather is clear[br]and we'll be in Seattle on schedule.

01:04:16.52,01:04:24.39
- Don't you hate flying?[br]- Yes. and I've told a terrible lie.

01:04:24.57,01:04:28.52
Is any lie a betrayal?

01:04:28.70,01:04:33.03
I said flying.

01:04:38.21,01:04:42.62
- Thanks for bringing me here.[br]- He likes the planes.

01:04:42.80,01:04:49.60
Can I bring you back a souvenir?[br]Maybe one of these snow globes?

01:04:49.76,01:04:54.59
Sure, I'd really like that.[br]Thank you so much.

01:04:56.02,01:04:59.64
- He's eight.[br]- He's good at it.

01:04:59.82,01:05:04.85
Children are hideous at that age.

01:05:05.03,01:05:12.00
Maybe when I come back, the to of[br]us ought to spend some time alone.

01:05:16.50,01:05:19.62
Bye. Bye, Jonah.

01:05:24.89,01:05:27.09
Jonah.

01:05:27.26,01:05:30.76
Listen, you don't know Victoria.

01:05:30.93,01:05:36.05
In fact she's a mystery to me, too.

01:05:36.23,01:05:40.28
She tosses her hair a lot. Why?

01:05:40.44,01:05:45.44
Is it a titch? Does she need[br]a haircut or a barrette?

01:05:47.08,01:05:54.49
I'd like to understand these things.[br]And that's why I'm dating her.

01:05:54.67,01:06:00.04
Just dating. I'm not living[br]with her. I'm not marrying her.

01:06:00.22,01:06:03.75
Can you appreciate the difference?

01:06:03.93,01:06:08.56
That's what single people do.[br]They see how other people fit.

01:06:08.72,01:06:15.30
Everyone's an adjustment. There's[br]no such thing as a perfect... 

01:06:30.67,01:06:34.24
Come on.

01:06:34.79,01:06:41.37
Dad, Jessica says[br]you knew Annie in another life.

01:06:41.55,01:06:46.34
The one who wrote us. But you[br]never got together in that life.

01:06:46.52,01:06:52.44
Your hearts will be a complete[br]puzzle once you're together.

01:06:52.61,01:06:59.44
I know that because I'm young and[br]pure, in touch with cosmic forces.

01:06:59.61,01:07:05.15
Who told you that? I sure hope[br]you're not marrying Jessica.

01:09:48.84,01:09:53.67
- I watched them play at the beach.[br]- Did you talk to him?

01:09:53.84,01:09:57.42
Couldn't do it.

01:09:57.60,01:10:03.30
- How did I get here?[br]- You lied and got on a plane.

01:10:04.56,01:10:11.90
- I'm going to talk to him tomorrow.[br]- Okay. Good. Goodbye.

01:10:12.07,01:10:15.48
Beck... 

01:10:16.16,01:10:22.00
- Is this crazy?[br]- No, that's the weirdest part

01:10:22.17,01:10:28.29
- Thank you. I love you.[br]- I love you, too.

01:11:30.70,01:11:35.00
It's good to see you. Where's Greg?

01:11:57.90,01:12:01.97
Hello.

01:12:08.66,01:12:13.04
- Then what?[br]- I left, obviously.

01:12:13.20,01:12:18.96
- You were in the street?[br]- It was like walking around naked.

01:12:19.13,01:12:24.80
- I love that dream.[br]- This was more humiliating.

01:12:24.97,01:12:29.01
But he saw you.[br]You were face to face.

01:12:29.18,01:12:36.01
He said hello.[br]And all I could say was hello.

01:12:36.94,01:12:42.53
- All I could say was hello.[br]- It's a sign.

01:12:42.69,01:12:47.81
It's a sign that I've watched[br]this movie too many times.

01:12:47.99,01:12:54.61
From the minute I heard that program[br]I've been a complete jerk.

01:12:54.79,01:12:58.66
- You're not a jerk.[br]- Thank you. An idiot!

01:12:58.84,01:13:04.59
- You don't know who she was.[br]- I have a picture of her.

01:13:04.76,01:13:11.09
The detective sent it to me.[br]See. that's what she looks like.

01:13:11.98,01:13:17.10
- It's her back.[br]- It's her and he's crazy about her.

01:13:17.27,01:13:22.19
What's this?[br]It's from Seattle.

01:13:29.25,01:13:31.95
Becky.

01:13:33.04,01:13:36.49
So I mailed your letter... 

01:13:37.21,01:13:43.25
"Dear Annie. Thanks for your letter.[br]You sound neat."

01:13:46.56,01:13:51.72
"We're excited about meeting you[br]in New York, and seeing if we're... 

01:13:51.89,01:13:56.36
... M-F-E-O."

01:13:56.52,01:14:00.74
"See you soon.[br]Sleepless in Seattle."

01:14:00.90,01:14:04.95
M-F-E-O?

01:14:06.74,01:14:10.36
Made for each other.

01:14:10.54,01:14:13.71
It's cute. Like a little clue.

01:14:18.30,01:14:21.67
So he can't write. Big deal.

01:14:21.84,01:14:27.52
Verbal ability is overrated in guys.[br]Our need for it leads to trouble.

01:14:27.68,01:14:32.72
- I'm going to run back to Walter.[br]- And the letter?

01:14:32.90,01:14:37.68
It was written before I went[br]out there. Before the 'ho.

01:14:40.32,01:14:47.32
But she didn't look like a 'ho.[br]She looked like one of our friends.

01:14:51.04,01:14:56.83
- You saw her in the airport, too?[br]- It was like I knew her.

01:14:57.01,01:15:02.43
- Like a deja-vu?[br]- It was very deja-vu-ish.

01:15:02.60,01:15:08.27
- At least you're seeing people.[br]- Well, only one... 

01:15:08.44,01:15:12.57
- Victoria.[br]- You don't like her?

01:15:12.73,01:15:18.02
- She laughs like a hyena.[br]- Is this true?

01:15:18.20,01:15:22.36
Sort of. Tell them what you did.

01:15:22.53,01:15:25.79
Tell them about the radio show.

01:15:25.96,01:15:29.70
Christmas Eve he calls a radio show.

01:15:29.88,01:15:36.76
- And tells them I need a new wife.[br]- That's so sweet.

01:15:36.93,01:15:41.00
Now he's obsessed with[br]a woman who wrote me.

01:15:41.18,01:15:46.38
She wants to meet me on top of[br]Empire State on Valentines Day.

01:15:46.56,01:15:52.18
It's like that movie.[br]"An Affair to Remember".

01:15:52.36,01:15:57.44
Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.[br]Is that "car" or "cur"?

01:16:00.78,01:16:06.54
They were to meet at the Empire[br]State, but she got hit by a taxi.

01:16:06.71,01:16:11.58
He waited and waited.[br]And it was raining.

01:16:11.76,01:16:18.21
Then she's too proud[br]to tell him that she's... 

01:16:20.60,01:16:26.47
... crippled. And he's too proud[br]to find out why she doesn't come.

01:16:26.65,01:16:30.52
But he comes to see her anyway.

01:16:30.69,01:16:35.40
It's amazing when he visits her.

01:16:35.57,01:16:40.28
He doesn't notice that she[br]doesn't get up to say hello.

01:16:40.45,01:16:43.71
And he's very bitter.

01:16:43.87,01:16:48.74
You think he's going to walk out[br]and never know why.

01:16:48.92,01:16:57.13
She's just lying there with[br]a blanket over her shriveled legs.

01:16:59.22,01:17:02.42
- Are you all right?[br]- She's fine.

01:17:02.60,01:17:09.06
The he says, "I saw the painting,"[br]and goes into the bedroom.

01:17:09.23,01:17:13.19
And he comes out and looks at her.

01:17:13.36,01:17:17.86
And they just know[br]and hug and it's so... 

01:17:18.04,01:17:21.65
- That's a chick's movie.[br]- I'd say so.

01:17:21.83,01:17:27.70
- Who'd write a guy from the radio?[br]- I got hundreds of letters.

01:17:27.88,01:17:32.58
- Desperate women.[br]- Is wanting a nice guy desperate?

01:17:32.76,01:17:38.21
It's easier to be killed[br]by terrorists than to marry over 40.

01:17:38.39,01:17:42.80
- That is not true![br]- Right, honey.

01:17:42.98,01:17:48.43
I don't want a mail-order bride.[br]Just someone who can converse -

01:17:48.61,01:17:54.45
- without falling into[br]weepy tears over an old movie.

01:17:54.62,01:18:00.65
I cried over "The Dirty Dozen".[br]Jim Brown throwing the grenades.

01:18:00.83,01:18:06.45
Richard Jaeckel and Lee Marvin[br]on top of a tank dressed like nazis.

01:18:08.17,01:18:15.17
Trini Lopez... breaks his neck[br]when they're parachuting.

01:18:15.35,01:18:20.18
Richard Jaeckel had on a shiny[br]helmet. because he was an MP.

01:18:20.35,01:18:25.10
Please, no more.[br]God. I love that movie.

01:18:33.49,01:18:38.20
- This is the best movie I ever saw.[br]- What's so great about it?

01:18:38.37,01:18:43.03
- You have to find her.[br]- How much would it cost to go?

01:18:43.21,01:18:47.87
Nobody knows.[br]It changes practically every day.

01:18:48.05,01:18:51.33
- How much money do you have?[br]- 80 dollars.

01:18:51.51,01:18:57.52
- I have 42. That'll cover cabs.[br]- How would I get there?

01:18:57.69,01:19:03.44
I have to drop these tickets off.[br]Can you keep an eye on things?

01:19:13.79,01:19:17.07
- Window seat or aisle?[br]- Window.

01:19:17.25,01:19:22.03
You want a fruit plate? I'd rather[br]die than eat airplane food.

01:19:22.21,01:19:26.51
I'll write you're 12.[br]That way you can fly unaccompanied.

01:19:26.68,01:19:33.26
- Who'd believe I'm 12?[br]- They'll believe the computer.

01:19:33.43,01:19:38.89
I'll say you're short for your age,[br]but that they shouldn't mention it.

01:19:39.06,01:19:41.31
Great idea

01:20:01.59,01:20:05.46
- You'll miss the train.[br]- No I won't.

01:20:05.63,01:20:11.14
I'm so happy, Becky.[br]This is right. It's real.

01:20:11.31,01:20:16.47
The other things happen in movies.

01:20:16.65,01:20:20.69
Don't tell anyone what I did.[br]I'd die -

01:20:20.86,01:20:27.27
- if anyone knew I did anything[br]like that. You promise?

01:20:27.45,01:20:31.69
Sleepless in Seattle is history.

01:21:04.11,01:21:07.32
- Go ahead.[br]- No, you go.

01:21:07.49,01:21:11.74
I was going to say[br]that since Christmas -

01:21:11.91,01:21:15.87
- you've been kind of distracted.

01:21:16.04,01:21:22.33
But now it feels as if you're coming[br]back from wherever you were.

01:21:22.51,01:21:25.79
I am.

01:21:25.97,01:21:32.01
I was just... [br]I think I got nervous.

01:21:32.73,01:21:39.61
But that's normal, right?[br]Don't you ever feel nervous... 

01:21:40.78,01:21:45.73
- About what?[br]- Forever.

01:21:46.41,01:21:49.58
No.

01:21:51.29,01:21:56.04
Well... I did.

01:21:56.21,01:22:01.50
And I think I thought[br]it was too perfect.

01:22:01.68,01:22:07.38
I was afraid we'd be two rights[br]making a wrong.

01:22:07.56,01:22:14.36
You know. it was like kismet.[br]but not, if you see what I mean.

01:22:14.52,01:22:19.52
You have to grow up and forget[br]the adolescent fantasies about -

01:22:19.70,01:22:24.24
- how exciting life will be.[br]I'm sorry, but I love this pattern.

01:22:24.41,01:22:29.15
You couldn't. This is just[br]like my grandmother's china.

01:22:29.33,01:22:33.83
- How many place settings?[br]- Ten.

01:22:35.92,01:22:42.59
Exactly. Eight is too few,[br]twelve is too many.

01:23:05.50,01:23:10.04
- Walter... [br]- It was my mother's.

01:23:11.00,01:23:16.76
I had them size it down.[br]She had really fat fingers.

01:23:19.22,01:23:23.46
It's so beautiful.[br]It's exactly what I'd pick -

01:23:23.64,01:23:28.89
- if I had every ring[br]in the world to choose from.

01:23:29.90,01:23:34.68
Some people want a relationship[br]to be full of surprises, -

01:23:34.86,01:23:39.11
- but I'm not one of them.

01:23:39.74,01:23:44.32
Surprises are highly overrated.

01:23:45.25,01:23:45.29
I'll only be gone one night.[br]Clarise will be here... 

01:23:45.29,01:23:50.16
I'll only be gone one night.[br]Clarise will be here... 

01:23:50.34,01:23:54.29
You can watch scary movies.

01:23:54.47,01:23:59.38
- Are you going with her?[br]- I'm going with Victoria.

01:24:01.72,01:24:05.34
Don't try anything tricky.

01:24:07.56,01:24:14.10
Don't roll in poison ivy or[br]do anything so you need stitches.

01:24:14.28,01:24:21.11
If your finger falls off, it stays[br]off. I won't take you to hospital.

01:24:22.04,01:24:26.20
- Is this about that woman?[br]- Annie.

01:24:29.75,01:24:34.08
- I don't care what you do[br]- I'll tell you what I'm doing.

01:24:34.26,01:24:40.27
I'm getting laid. I'm the only man[br]in the 90's who's getting laid.

01:24:40.43,01:24:46.02
And I haven't been laid that much.[br]Six or seven girls at college.

01:24:46.19,01:24:50.18
How long have you been there?[br]What did you hear me say?

01:24:50.36,01:24:55.81
-"Six-seven girls at college."[br]- Seven... Eight Mary Kelly.

01:24:55.99,01:25:00.12
This is the one I like.

01:25:00.29,01:25:05.16
Jonah, you won't like any woman,[br]because it isn't your mother.

01:25:05.34,01:25:10.62
- What's wrong with Annie?[br]- Jonah, shut up.

01:25:10.80,01:25:16.81
Shut up? Mum never told me[br]to shut up or yelled at me.

01:25:16.97,01:25:19.89
This conversation is over

01:25:20.06,01:25:26.64
This woman could be a sick lunatic.[br]Didn't you see "Fatal Attraction"?

01:25:26.82,01:25:32.60
- You wouldn't let me.[br]- It scared every man in America.

01:25:34.62,01:25:38.75
I'm not leaving till you say yes.

01:25:42.71,01:25:44.95
I hate you

01:25:45.13,01:25:49.08
Good, then you can tell Oprah[br]how your dad ruined your life -

01:25:49.26,01:25:53.42
- by going of for a weekend[br]special at the Holiday lnn

01:26:07.94,01:26:13.11
Jonah. Clarise is here[br]and I've got to go.

01:26:22.04,01:26:27.88
Jonah. Iisten.[br]I've got to go... 

01:26:55.12,01:27:01.13
Jessica, tell us where he is.[br]Jonah's dad is very upset.

01:27:01.29,01:27:06.72
Jessica, this is your father.[br]Tell us where he is.

01:27:08.59,01:27:11.93
- N-Y.[br]- That means "no way".

01:27:12.10,01:27:14.97
That's N-W

01:27:15.14,01:27:20.35
- He's on his way to New York.[br]- How?

01:27:20.52,01:27:23.56
United. 597.

01:27:23.74,01:27:27.40
- When does it leave?[br]- 7:30.

01:27:33.33,01:27:37.79
Here's a pin for flying with us.

01:27:37.96,01:27:41.74
- Can I take this for you?[br]- No.

01:27:56.10,01:28:00.10
- Where to. kid?[br]- Empire State Building.

01:28:00.28,01:28:04.60
- Empire State Building.[br]- Don't stop so close to the curb.

01:28:06.62,01:28:11.82
There it is. What are you going[br]to do up there? Spit off the top?

01:28:12.00,01:28:15.20
No, I'm meeting my new mother.

01:28:35.35,01:28:41.31
- I'm Jonah. Are you Annie?[br]- No, I'm Cynthia.

01:28:47.66,01:28:51.87
Excuse me, are you Annie?

01:29:28.70,01:29:31.82
Great table. Thanks.

01:29:33.04,01:29:35.91
Is something wrong?

01:29:36.09,01:29:40.13
- Can I get you a drink?[br]- Champagne?

01:29:40.30,01:29:42.88
Fine.

01:29:43.05,01:29:47.27
We'll have a bottle of Dom DeLuise.

01:29:49.64,01:29:54.64
- Just kidding.[br]- He meant Dom Perignon.

01:29:56.90,01:30:00.02
Beautiful view.

01:30:00.20,01:30:04.74
Walter... [br]There's something I must tell you.

01:30:19.38,01:30:22.67
Sorry, an emergency.

01:30:22.85,01:30:26.98
Money, money, money, see?

01:31:42.39,01:31:47.34
So he could be on top of[br]the Empire State Building now?

01:31:47.52,01:31:53.23
No. I guess he could be... No.

01:31:53.86,01:31:59.87
It's not him. Walter. It's me.[br]I can't do this.

01:32:01.66,01:32:08.46
Annie, I love you.[br]But let's leave that out of this.

01:32:09.42,01:32:16.22
I don't want to be someone that you[br]or anybody else settles for.

01:32:18.22,01:32:23.68
Marriage is hard enough[br]without such low expectations.

01:32:23.85,01:32:28.40
- Isn't it?[br]- Walter, I don't deserve you.

01:32:29.23,01:32:33.10
No, I wouldn't put it that way.

01:32:33.28,01:32:37.33
But... okay.

01:32:51.76,01:32:57.63
- You okay?[br]- Yeah.

01:33:00.98,01:33:04.23
- What?[br]- Look.

01:33:11.74,01:33:15.78
- It's a sign.[br]- Who needed a sign?

01:33:15.95,01:33:19.86
Walter, I have to go.

01:33:32.93,01:33:36.10
Jonah

01:33:38.73,01:33:41.76
Dad

01:33:54.95,01:33:59.17
What if something happened to you?[br]What if I couldn't get to you?

01:33:59.33,01:34:03.66
I'm sorry.

01:34:04.30,01:34:09.72
What would I have done?[br]You're my family. You're all I have.

01:34:09.89,01:34:12.50
I thought she'd be here.

01:34:12.68,01:34:17.84
We're doing okay, right?[br]So far, have I done anything stupid?

01:34:18.02,01:34:23.01
- Have I screwed it up for us?[br]- No.

01:35:14.25,01:35:18.82
- Observation deck?[br]- Sorry, it's too late.

01:35:19.00,01:35:24.54
- Please. I need to get up there.[br]- We're closing up.

01:35:29.30,01:35:35.31
Can I just take a look?[br]I'm supposed to meet someone.

01:35:35.48,01:35:40.47
He's probably not there, but if[br]I don't look, I'll always wonder.

01:35:40.65,01:35:44.86
- Cary Grant, right?[br]- You know that movie?

01:35:45.03,01:35:48.98
It's one of my wife's favourites.

01:35:55.92,01:36:00.49
Maybe when we get home[br]we'll get a dog.

01:36:00.67,01:36:06.46
- Wouldn't you like to have a dog?[br]- Sure.

01:36:18.36,01:36:22.65
I'm sorry, ma'am. Empty.

01:36:23.57,01:36:28.99
- Can I take a minute?[br]- Go ahead.

01:37:41.91,01:37:45.78
I left it by the telescopes.

01:38:10.90,01:38:16.57
It's you.[br]I saw you in the street.

01:38:16.74,01:38:21.06
- Are you Annie?[br]- Yes.

01:38:23.87,01:38:27.40
You're Annie?

01:38:28.42,01:38:32.58
- This must be yours.[br]- I'm Jonah.

01:38:32.75,01:38:37.67
- This is my dad. His name is Sam.[br]- Hi. Jonah.

01:38:38.68,01:38:41.55
Sam... 

01:38:44.73,01:38:49.76
- And who's this?[br]- Howard.

01:39:05.21,01:39:08.82
We'd better go.

01:39:14.05,01:39:17.08
Shall we?

01:40:02.52,01:40:06.85
Sam... It's nice to meet you.
