112
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:35,540

It took years before it worked like clockwork. It takes time.

118
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:12,870
-你有小名吗？ -没有
Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?

119
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:19,420
-小时候也没有？ -没有

I forgot your stepmother's present. When we're old and gray...

122

你得提醒我戴假牙 这样我出门就不会忘了
...you must remind me to put my teeth in, so I don't go out without them.

123
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,860

有何愿望？ 我的愿望是转台
My wish is to change the station.

143
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:40,840
-医生与你的主题是“你的脾脏” -下辈子吧
- And now: "You and your spleen." - Not on your life.

144
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,760
接下来“圣诞铃声”倒着唱 由新泽西合唱团呈献
Coming up, "Jingle Bells" backwards, sung by...

00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,100
-西雅图，说吧 -我叫乔纳…
- Seattle, go ahead. - This is Jonah...

146
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,990
不用说姓氏 你的声音很年轻，几岁了？
No last names, Jonah. How old are you?

147
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,190
-八岁 -怎么这么晚还没睡？
- I'm eight. - You're up late.

148
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:04,080
-在西雅图不晚 -对，你的圣诞愿望是什么？
- It's not so late in Seattle. - You're right. What's your wish?

149
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:09,910
-不为我，是为我爸，他需要新妻子 -你不喜欢现在这个？
- My dad needs a new wife. - You don't like the one he has?

150
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:14,080
-问题是他没有！ -你妈呢？
- He doesn't have one. - Where's your mum?

151
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:19,920
-她死了 -谁会相信有这种事
- She died. - Well, who can believe this?

152
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,890
-我很难过，但我爸比我还糟 -你和他谈过吗？
- I've been sad, but Dad's worse. - Have you talked to him about it?

153
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:31,480
没有，这会让他更伤心
No, that makes him sadder.

154
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:34,360
我了解，乔纳 你爸现在在家吗？
Jonah, is your dad home?

155
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:39,190
-在忙吗？ -不忙，他在甲板上
- Is he busy? - No, he's out on the deck.

156
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,530
我可以帮忙 但要他听电话
Can't you ask him to talk to me?

157
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:48,580
-坏女人！挂上，乔纳，别听她的 -不行，他会杀了我
- Wretched woman! Hang up, Jonah! - No, he'd kill me.

158
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:53,590
相信我，乔纳，他知道你关心 他就不会生气
He won't be angry when he hears how concerned you are about him.

159
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,000
-打赌？ -如果他骂人，就再不听你的节目
- Want to bet? - If he yells, you lose a fan.

160
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:06,850
爸，有人打电话找你
Dad, there's someone on the phone for you.

161
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,400
他叫山姆
His name is Sam.

162
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:18,190
山姆，假如你刚开收音机 今晚的主题是你的愿望与梦想
If you've just tuned in, tonight's topic is wishes and dreams.

163
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:21,860
我们与西雅图通话中
We have a listener from Seattle.

164
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,780
喂？山姆 我是全美电台的菲尔斯通医生
Sam, this is Dr. Fieldstone on Network America.

165
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:31,200
你想卖什么？ 烤肉架还是刀
What are you selling? Micro-hibachis or knives?

166
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:36,550
我不卖东西，我想帮你 你儿子来电
Neither. I want to help. Your son asked me for advice.

167
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,840
-问如何帮你找个新妻子 -你是哪位？
- He wants to find you a new wife. - Who is this?

168
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:47,640
我是全美电台 玛莎·菲尔斯通医生，我们正在广播
Dr. Fieldstone of Network America. You are on the air.

169
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:52,150
-你打给电台？ -山姆，你在听吗？
- You called a radio station? - Sam, are you there?

170
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,160
-听见 -你儿子觉得你丧妻后郁郁寡欢
- Yes. - You mourn your wife's death.

171
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,820
他非常担心你
Your son is worried about you.

172
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,580
嘿！出来！ 别想叫我一个人出丑
Get out here. I won't go through this alone.

173
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,910
我想他很难向你启齿
It's hard for him to talk to you about this.

174
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:15,830
我们谈谈 或许能让乔纳宽心一些
If we talk about it, maybe Jonah will feel better.

175
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:21,220
-跟她谈，她是医生 -什么医生？也许她名字就叫“医生”
- Talk to her. She's a doctor. - Her first name could be Doctor.

176
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:28,390
-求求你 -山姆，这是他的圣诞愿望
- Please. - Sam, it's his Christmas wish.

177
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,270
-好吧 -很好
- Okay. - Good.

178
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,690
我知道你不想提 您太太去世多久了？
I know this is difficult. When did your wife die?

179
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:43,280
-大约一年半 -之后你交过女友吗？
- About a year and a half ago. - Have you had any relationships?

180
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,490
-没有 -为什么不？
- No. - Why not?

181
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,330
-玛莎…还是菲尔斯通医生？ -玛莎医生
- Marcia... or Dr. Fieldstone? - Dr. Marcia.

182
00:16:54,510 --> 00:17:00,680

- I don't mean to be rude... - I don't want to pry...

183
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:08,220
-你当然想 -说吧，我在听
- Sure you do. - Go on, Sam. I'm listening.

184
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,640
起先我们父子很痛苦
We had a pretty tough time at first.

185
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:18,110
但我们还在熬
But we're dealing with it.

186
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:24,500
我和乔纳会恢复平静 等我摔了他的收音机后
Jonah and I will get along fine, as soon as I break his radio.

187
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,210
我确信你是个好爸爸
I'm sure you're a wonderful father.

188
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,290
-声音听得出来 -当然了
- You can tell a lot from a voice. - Yes, you can.

189
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,710
但乔纳觉得你还在低潮
But Jonah still feels that you're under a cloud.

190
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:43,260
-你晚上睡得着吗？ -他根本没睡
- Are you sleeping at night? - He doesn't sleep at all.

192
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,230
听着，圣诞节到了
Look, it's Christmas.

193
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,780
玛吉…是我太太…
Maggie... my wife.

194
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,950
她热烈庆祝…
She really did it...

195
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,790
她钟爱… 一切都布置的很美
She loved... She made everything beautiful.

196
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,760
每到这时节更难熬
It's tough this time of year.

197
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:22,170
-每个孩子都需要妈妈 -你是否也和乔纳一样需要个伴？
- Every kid needs a mother. - Maybe you need someone too.

198
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:29,100
-是的 -先别回答，广告时间
- Yes. - We'll resume after these messages.

199
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:35,820
山姆、乔纳，别走开 我们和“西雅图夜未眠”通话
Sam and Jonah, don't go away. I'm talking to Sleepless in Seattle.

200
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,980
等一下来听众反应
We'll be back with listener response.

201
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,620
-那是什么意思？ -别人可以打电话骂你
- What's that? - People call in and dump on you.

202
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:50,660
有意思，真有用
This is really fun. And helpful.

203
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,960
（首都餐厅 来吃吧）

204
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,510
-他一定是高大翘屁股 -我说他几周不洗澡
- I bet he's tall with a cute butt. - I bet he hasn't bathed in weeks.

205
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,720
-需要什么吗？ -茶，外带
- Yes? - Tea, with the bag out.

206
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:13,060
-也许我会赶去西雅图送他个新年贺礼 -去呀，千万别开他冰箱
- Maybe I'll just go up to Seattle. - Don't open his refrigerator.

207
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,650
男人都不会把东西包好放入冰箱
Men don't cover food, and they leave it in there till it walks out.

208
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:24,160
我不会为小事把他踢下床 你明白吗？谢谢你，6角5分
I wouldn't kick him out of bed for eating crackers. Sixty five cents.

209
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:31,040
这通电话之后便回到“夜未眠” 田纳西纳维市，请说
We'll take a call before we talk to Sleepless. Go ahead, Tennessee.

210
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,870
我想知道他的住址
I'd like to have his address.

211
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,920
甜心，排队吧
Honey, get in line.

212
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:46,390
-我想问个问题 -问吧
- If I could ask you a question... - Go ahead.

213
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,680
真爱过的人很难再恋爱
People who truly loved are likely to love again.

214
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:57,200
山姆，你能再如此深爱一个人吗？
Sam, could you love anybody as much as you loved your wife?

215
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,610
玛莎医生，这很难想像
Well, that's hard to imagine.

216
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,910
你打算怎么办？
What are you going to do?

217
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:13,300
我打算每天清晨起床 整天呼吸
Get out of bed every morning and breathe in and out all day long.

218
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:21,640
过阵子… 我就不必提醒自己起床呼吸
And after a while I won't have to remind myself to do it.

219
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:31,690
再过一阵子…我就不会 想起过去的日子有多么完美
And then after a while I won't remember how perfect things were.

220
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,150
您太太的魅力何在？
Why was your wife so special?

221
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,780
你的节目有多长？
How long is your program?

222
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:46,700
无数件小事情，若加起来
It was a million little things.

223
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,540
那表示我们是前生注定的
When you added them up, it meant we were meant for each other.

224
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:56,080
我知道 第一次接触她时我便知道
I knew it the very first time I touched her.

225
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:02,180
就像回家 却是前所未知的家
It was like coming home, only to no home I'd ever known.

226
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:05,640
而我只是牵她的手…
I was just taking her hand...

227
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:10,430
扶她下车 我就知道了
...to help her out of a car. And I knew it.

228
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,270
-就像是…魔力 -魔力
- It was like... magic. - Magic.

229
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:22,790
各位，时间到了 我是芝加哥的菲尔斯通医生
It's time to wrap it up. I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone.

230
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,290
祝所有听众有个 神奇的圣诞夜
To all my listeners, a magical and Merry Christmas.

231
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:34,710
还有你“西雅图夜未眠” 希望再听到你的进展
And Sleepless in Seattle, call and tell us how it's going.

232
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,580
一言为定
You can count on it.

233
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,830
?Ray Charles: "Over The Rainbow"?

234
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:51,260
?I know ?
?Somewhere over the rainbow ?

235
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,640
?The blue birds fly ?

236
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,980
?Birds fly ?

237
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,610
?Over the rainbow ?

238
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,200
?Why then, oh why can't I? ?

239
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,970
（巴尔的摩太阳报）

240
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,970
他的汤是最鲜美的 而人却是美国最坏的
He sells the best soup ever and he is the meanest man in America.

241
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:35,820
-很有写头，不止是汤 -写吧
- I feel strongly about this. - Do it.

242
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,570
别叫我采访纽约除夕夜
New Year's Eve. I won't write it.

243
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,990
听着 “芝加哥电信中断两小时
Listen: "Phone service was tied up Christmas Eve...

244
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,500
因一名儿童向电台诉说 其父需要再婚
...when a kid called the radio and said his dad needs a new wife."

245
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:51,380
两千名妇女 来电索取电话号码”
Two thousand women wanted his number.

246
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,760
我有听到，他说
I heard it. This kid calls up...

247
00:22:54,930 --> 00:23:01,010
我爸爸需要个妻子 主持人要当事人跟她谈
...and the shrink forces the father to talk about it.

248
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,300
他说不，但接着他说出…
Suddenly he starts talking...

249
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,890
他有多爱他老婆 像密西根那些母牛
...about how he fell in love with her like these cows in Michigan.

250
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,560
新闻播过母牛被电流击中 也许是在威斯康星
The cows that got zapped by stray voltage. Maybe it was Wisconsin.

251
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:23,200
我听着听着… 就开始哭了
Anyway, I was listening to him, and suddenly I was crying.

252
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:26,540
就像看到电话公司广告
Like when I see the ad...

253
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:31,670
那女人送她妈 冰箱那一幕
...where the daughter gives her mum the refrigerator with a red bow.

254
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,460
-还有两个孩子在派对 -替爷爷做相册的广告

00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:24,810
起床，呼吸
...to get up and breathe in and out.

385
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:31,650
再过一阵子我就不会…
Then after a while I won't have to think about...

386
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:35,980
想起过去的日子有多么完美
...how I had it great and perfect for a while.

387
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,650
您太太的魅力何在？
Why was your wife so special?

388
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:43,780
你的节目有多长？
How long is your program?

389
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:51,330
无数件小事情
It was a million little things.

390
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:56,120
若加起来 那表示我们是前生注定的
When you added them up, it meant we were meant for each other.

391
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:01,010
我知道 头一次接触她时我便知道
I knew it, the first time I touched her.

392
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:06,600
就像回家 却是前所未知的家
It was like coming home, only to no home I'd ever known.

393
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:12,980
而我只是牵她的手 扶她下车
I was just taking her hand to help her out of a car.

394
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:18,360
我就知道了 就像是…
And I knew it. It was like...

395
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:22,150
魔力
...magic.

396
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:46,260
我快疯了，丹尼斯 你婚姻幸福吗？
I think I'm going crazy, Dennis. Are you happily married?

397
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,270
你为何结婚？ 你们热情难熄？
Why did you get married? Was it trumpets and fireworks?

398
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,310
贝琪说要不就分手，要不就结婚 所以我们就结婚了
Betsy said we had to break up or get married. That's why.

399
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,360
你们邂逅时 你心中只有她吗？
When you met, did you think she was the only one for you?

400
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,650
像是命中注定要结合
That in some way it was fated?

401
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:08,620
安妮，两情相悦只是
Annie, attraction is...

402
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:13,830
潜意识互相吸引
...when your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious.

403
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:19,170
命运只是两条 完全吻合的神经
Fate is two neuroses knowing they're a perfect match.

404
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:25,470
我根本不认识他 我对一个住在西雅图
I'm having all these fantasies about a man I never even met!

405
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:29,760
-素不相识的人产生幻想 -西雅图一年下九个月雨
- And he lives in Seattle! - It rains nine months a year there.

406
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,940
我知道，我不想搬去
I know. I won't move to Seattle.

407
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:44,110
但我不想 有所为不为而遗憾终生
But I don't want to end up wondering what might have happened.

408
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:49,030
你认为呢？ 是婚前不安，是吗？
What do you think? It's cold feet, isn't it?

409
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:53,710
-每个人婚前都会紧张，你呢？ -我也是
- Everybody panics. Didn't you? - Yes, I did.

410
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:59,630
谢谢，说出来我舒服多了
Thanks, Dennis. I feel better now.

411
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:05,680
珊蒂有个女友练举重的 但她的脖子没有很粗
Sandy's friend is a weightlifter, but her neck isn't that big.

412
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:12,940
不不，我不是要你替我作媒 只是想搞清楚状况
No, don't set me up. I want to know what it's like out there.

413
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:18,200
现在的女人找有胸肌 和翘屁股的男人
Women are looking for pecs and a cute butt.

414
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:22,580
像…“他的屁股好正点” 最近在哪听过？
"He has the cutest butt." Where did I hear that recently?

415
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:29,490
到处都在说 连报新闻的都这么说
Everywhere. Even on the news women talk about cute butts.

416
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:33,130
不知是谁先起的头
It's really caught on.

417
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,840
那我的屁股呢？
So how's my butt?

418
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:41,300
-还不赖 -是吗？翘不翘？
- Not bad. - Is it cute though?

419
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,890
难说，要用量角器量吗？
Are we grading on a curve?

420
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,470
你多久前约会的？
When was your last date?

421
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,780
吉米·卡特总统时代，1978年
Jimmy Carter... 1978.

422
00:39:54,950 --> 00:40:00,690
现在方式有点改变 首先你们先交朋友，彼此喜欢
Things are different now. First you have to be friends.

423
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:04,700
再亲吻 这阶段可以维持好几年
Then you neck. This could go on for years.

424
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:09,410
接着是验血戴保险套 但饭钱可以平分
Then you have tests and do it with a condom. But you do split the check.

425
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:15,420
-我不能让女人出饭钱 -全市市民会极度推崇你
- I can't let a woman pay. - They'll throw a parade for you.

426
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:19,760
你会是西雅图年度人物
You'll be Man of the Year.

427
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:24,970
-提拉米苏，你会知道 -那是什么的
Tira misu. You'll find out what that is.

428
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:29,560
若对方要我做 我不会怎么办？
Some woman will want me to do it to her, and I won't know what it is.

429
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:36,860
-包你爱死 -约会会很难
- You'll love it. - This is going to be tough.

430
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:43,490
何不约班家那设计师？ 她挺活泼的
What about that decorator? She's perky.

431
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:50,160
我还不敢开口 目前只是收集资料
No. I'm far away from that. I'm just making notes.

432
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:55,500
-我怎么开口？ -打电话说：“过来选颜色”
- How would I do it? - Ask her over to look at swatches.

433
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:00,590
-打电话说：“过来选颜色”？ -对，选颜色
- To look at swatches? - Yeah, color schemes.

434
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:06,560
别照念，用你自己的方法 想想加里·格兰特
Don't do it like I did. Be suave. Think Cary Grant.

435
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:10,970
加里·格兰特会说 “过来看我的颜色样本”吗？
Would he say, "Come look at my swatches"?

436
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:16,110
-不是在电影中… -在《Gunga Din》里？
- Not it in movies... - Not in Gunga Din?

437
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,820
那不是爱情电影 或许他在真实生活里说过
Gunga Din isn't that kind of film. Who knows what he did in real life.

438
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:26,330
跟戴安·佳能说？ 对呀“黛安，来看我的颜色样本”
- He did that with Dyan Cannon? - "Dyan, look at these swatches."

439
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,520
乔纳，我回来了
Jonah, I'm home!

440
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,720
乔纳？
Jonah?

441
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,990
乔纳
Jonah.

442
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,040
爸，这是杰西卡
Hi, Dad. This is Jessica.

443
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,550
很高兴见到你，杰西卡
Nice to meet you.

444
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,680
好有趣 倒放时，是“保罗死了”
This is amazing. If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."

445
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:28,390
-我知道 -你怎么知道？
- Yeah, I know. - How do you know?

446
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,060
-爸，门关一下 -好
- Dad, could you shut the door? - Sure.

447
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:39,980
H和G 嗨和再见
H and G. Hi and goodbye.

448
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,460
?Gene Autry: "Back in the Saddle Again"?

449
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:28,350
?I'm back in the saddle again ?

450
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,690
喂，维多莉亚吗？
Hello, Victoria?

451
00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:01,330
我是山姆·鲍德温，记得吗？
This is Sam Baldwin. I don't know if you remember me...

452
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,450
太好了
Oh, great.

453
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:12,460
我在想 你是否愿意和我喝一杯
I was wondering if you would like to have a drink with me?

454
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:15,090
晚餐？
Dinner?

455
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,920
那更好…
Dinner would be even better.

456
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,560
周五可以…
Friday would be great.

457
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:26,430
听说那地方不错
I hear that's a good place.

458
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:32,270
七点半很好，我…
Seven-thirty is fine. And I'll...

459
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,360
好，到时见
Okay, I'll meet you there.

460
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:45,000
决定周五 七点半吃晚饭，好极了
So it's Friday at 7:30 for dinner. Great.

461
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:48,600
我也是，再见
Me too. Bye.

462
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,720
?Back in the saddle again ?

463
00:44:55,470 --> 00:45:01,890
-你爱他吗？ -现在不爱了
- Are you in love with him?  - Not now.

464
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:07,970
-那时的人才懂得爱 -你疯了
- Those people knew how to love. - You're a basket case.

465
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:14,390
时空都无法使他们分离 因为他们知道
They knew it. Nothing could separate them because they knew.

466
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:18,160
-那是真实正确的 -这是电影
- It was real. - It's a movie.

467
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:23,990
你的毛病就出在这里，你不想恋爱 你想要电影中的恋爱，念给我听
You don't want to be in love, you want to be in a movie. Read it.

468
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,460
“夜未眠父子： 我从没写过这种信”
"Dear Sleepless and Son. I've never written a letter like this before."

469
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:35,290
-每个人都这么写 -我知道，你当我白痴？
- That's what everyone writes. - You think I don't know that?

470
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,090
华特怎么办？
What about Walter?

471
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:43,260
华特，我一心想嫁华特
I'd give anything to marry Walter.

472
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:49,650
他完全无法预料 你以为你看得穿他，其实不行
He's so unexpected. You think you know him, but you don't.

473
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,570
我该写些关于魔力的事
I should write about magic.

474
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:58,570
若我命中属于他 却无缘相识
What if this man is my destiny, and I never meet him?

475
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:03,450
-有缘不一定好 -“我想见你们”
- Your destiny can be your doom. - "I want to meet you"...

476
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:08,540
-在帝国大厦顶楼 -在帝国大厦顶楼
- On the Empire State Building. - On the Empire State Building.

477
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:12,250
情人节日落时
Sunset, Valentine's Day.

478
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:16,540
我那时和华特在纽约 可以抽空出现
I'll be in New York with Walter. I can squeeze it in.

479
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,510
我将和华特在纽约
I'll be in New York with Walter!

480
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:32,480
因为命运我嫁给了马丁 买了有棵死树的房子
Because of fate I married Martin and bought the house with the dead tree.

481
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:36,900
所以离婚了
On account of which I got divorced and hit a car...

482
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:40,490
还害我撞车遇上瑞克
...and met Rick, while buying a neck brace.

483
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:44,280
等等，你没有提过 你离婚是因为死树
You got divorced because of a tree?

484
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,870
-是园丁 -你爱上园丁？
- The tree man. - You fell in love with him?

485
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:54,080
我没说爱，我有说吗？ 我最爱看这段
I did not say love. This is my favorite part.

486
00:46:55,220 --> 00:47:01,560
-现在或者永无机会 -永无是个可怕的字眼
- It's now or never. - Never is a frightening word.

487
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:06,260
错过幸福，我们就是傻子
We'd be fools to let happiness pass us by.

488
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:12,600
没有温暖回忆的 冬季多冷啊
Winter must be cold for those with no warm memories.

489
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,940
我们已错过春天
We've already missed the spring.

490
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:24,070
-男人就是看不懂这部戏 -我知道
- Men never get this movie. - I know.

491
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,820
妈咪！妈咪！
Mummy! Mummy!

492
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:36,830
-妈咪！ -别怕，我在这儿
- Mummy! - It's okay. I'm here. I'm coming.

493
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:43,010
没事了，梦到什么？
It's okay. What was that about?

494
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:48,680
房子在下沉，水从窗子灌进来
Our house was sinking. There was water coming in all the windows.

495
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:55,020
现在没事了
Well, it's okay now.

496
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:02,370
现在怎么办？你做噩梦时 你妈都唱歌给你听
What shall we do? Your mother sang to you when you had bad dreams.

497
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:07,080
唱“再见，黑鸟”
"Bye Bye Blackbird."

498
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:13,710
我想她 人死后会怎样？
I miss her. What happens to someone after they die?

499
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:20,130
-我不知道 -你相信有天堂吗？
- I don't know. - Do you believe in heaven?

500
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:29,180
从不信还有来生 但现在不确定了
I never believed in an afterlife. But now, I don't know.

501
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:36,270
因为我梦到… 你妈
Because I've had these dreams about your mum.

502
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:42,490
我们谈了很久 谈你的情况
We have long talks... about you.

503
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:48,950
她好像都知道 但我还是告诉她了
How you're doing. She sort of knows, but I tell her anyway.

504
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:55,550
那怎么解释？ 有点像来生吧？
So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?

505
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:59,760
我开始忘记她了
I'm starting to forget her.

506
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:19,480
她会削苹果
She could peel an apple...

507
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:23,290
皮都不断
...in one long, curly strip.

508
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:25,460
?Joe Cocker: "Bye Bye Blackbird"?

509
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,000
整个苹果
The whole apple.

我是布朗宁机长 高度三万五千英尺
This is Captain Browning. We're cruising at 35,000 feet.

640
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:17,880
天气晴朗 可望准时飞抵西雅图
The weather is clear and we'll be in Seattle on schedule.

641
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:25,930
-你讨厌飞行吗？ -对，我刚向我要嫁的人撒了大谎
- Don't you hate flying? - Yes, and I've told a terrible lie.

642
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:29,390
你觉得这是不是 一种背叛？
Is any lie a betrayal?

643
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:33,400
我是在说飞行
I said flying.

644
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:44,160
-谢谢你送我来 -他喜欢飞机
- Thanks for bringing me here. - He likes the planes.

645
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:51,120
回来送你个纪念品 雪球好吗？摇一摇雪花就飘落
Can I bring you back a souvenir? Maybe one of these snow globes?

646
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:56,130
我很喜欢，谢谢
Sure, I'd really like that. Thank you so much.

647
01:04:57,550 --> 01:05:01,170
-他才八岁 -他很厉害
- He's eight. - He's good at it.

648
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:06,390
报导说八岁的孩子都这样 是很正常的
I've read an article about it. Children are hideous at that age.

649
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:13,480
等我回来后 或许我俩可以单独聚聚，如何？
Maybe when I come back, the two of us ought to spend some time alone.

650
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:21,110
-再见，再见，乔纳 -再见
Bye. Bye, Jonah.

651
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,580
乔纳
Jonah.

652
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:32,250
听着，你不了解维多莉亚
Listen, you don't know Victoria.

653
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:37,540
我也不了解 对我来说她是个谜
In fact she's a mystery to me too.

654
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:41,760
她常甩头发，为什么？
She tosses her hair a lot. Why?

655
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:46,930
抽筋还是该剪头发？ 她该用发夹夹住对吗？
Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut or a barrette?

656
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:55,980
我想搞清楚这些事 所以才会跟她约会
I'd like to understand these things. And that's why I'm dating her.

657
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:01,530
约会而已 不是同居或娶她
Just dating. I'm not living with her. I'm not marrying her.

658
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:05,240
你能了解这差别吗？
Can you appreciate the difference?

659
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:10,040
单身贵族都这么做 先尝试彼此是否适应
That's what single people do. They see how other people fit.

660
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:16,800
互相调整，没有人完美无缺 根本没完美这回事
Everyone's an adjustment. There's no such thing as a perfect...

661
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:34,480
走吧
Come on.

662
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:42,870
爸，我和杰西卡谈到未来 她说你和安妮在前世认识
Dad, Jessica says you knew Annie in another life.

663
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:47,830
写信那个 你们上辈子没有在一起
The one who wrote us. But you never got together in that life.

664
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,920
就像缺角的拼图 两人在一起才完整
Your hearts will be a complete puzzle once you're together.

665
01:06:54,090 --> 01:07:00,930
我年幼纯洁 所以我比较能接触宇宙力量
I know that because I'm young and pure, in touch with cosmic forces.

666
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:06,640
谁告诉你这些的？ 我郑重劝你别娶杰西卡
Who told you that? I sure hope you're not marrying Jessica.

667
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:10,520
?Harry Connick Jr.: "A Wink and a Smile"?

668
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:17,230
?I remember the days ?
?Of just keeping time ?

669
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:23,200
?Of hanging around ?
?In sleepy towns forever ?

670
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:27,620
?Back roads empty for miles ?

671
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:34,340
?Well, you can't have a dream ?
?And cut it to fit ?

672
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,840
?But when I saw you, I knew ?

673
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:44,140
?We'd go together ?
?Like a wink and a smile ?

674
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:51,350
?Leave your old jalopy ?

675
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:55,150
?By the railroad track ?

676
01:07:56,570 --> 01:08:00,240
?We'll get a hip double-dip tip-toppy ?

677
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:03,860
?Two-seat Pontiac ?

678
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:10,830
?So you can rev her up ?
?Don't go slow ?

679
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:14,330
?It's only green lights and all rights ?

680
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:20,670
?Let's go together ?
?With a wink and a smile ?

681
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:38,230
?Give me a wink and a smile ?

682
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:54,620
?We go together ?
?Like a wink and a smile ?

683
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,710
?Now my heart is music ?

684
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:05,510
?Such a simple song ?

685
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:10,560
?Sing it again ?
?The notes never end ?

686
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:14,270
?This is where I belong ?

687
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:17,150
?Just the sound of your voice ?

688
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,190
?The light in your eyes ?

689
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:23,490
?We're so far away from yesterday ?

690
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:29,910
?Together with a wink and a smile ?

691
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:35,410
?We go together ?

692
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:40,460
?Like a wink and a smile ?

693
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:55,150
-我看着他陪他儿子在海边玩 -跟他讲话没有？
- I watched them play at the beach.  - Did you talk to him?

694
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:58,910
我不敢
Couldn't do it.

695
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:04,790
-我怎么来的？ -你撒了个谎搭上飞机
- How did I get here? - You lied and got on a plane.

696
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:13,380
-我明天去找他谈 -好，再见
- I'm going to talk to him tomorrow. - Okay. Good. Goodbye.

697
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:16,960
贝琪
Beck.

698
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:23,470
-这么做是不是很疯狂？ -不，这就是奇妙之处
- Is this crazy? - No, that's the weirdest part.

699
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:29,760
-谢谢，我爱你 -我也爱你
- Thank you. I love you. - I love you too.

700
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:36,460
见到你真开心 葛瑞格在哪里？
It's good to see you. Where's Greg?

701
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:01,950
你好
Hello.

702
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,740
你好

703
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:14,500
-然后呢？ -我就走了
- Then what? - I left, obviously.

704
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:20,420
-你站在路中央？ -记得梦到自己赤裸？
- You were in the street? - It was like walking around naked.

705
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:26,260
-我喜欢这个梦 -也比不上我的这么丢人
- I love that dream. - This was more humiliating.

706
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:30,480
他看到你了？面对面？
But he saw you. You were face to face.

707
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:37,490
他说“你好” 我只说得出“你好”
He said hello. And all I could say was hello.

708
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:43,990
-我只说得出“你好” -这是个好预兆
- All I could say was hello. - It's a sign.

709
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:49,280
表示我这部片看太多遍了
It's a sign that I've watched this movie too many times.

710
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:56,080
我好笨！听到广播后 我就像个蠢蛋
From the minute I heard that program I've been a complete jerk.

711
01:12:56,260 --> 01:13:00,130
-你不是蠢蛋 -谢谢，白痴好了
- You're not a jerk. - Thank you. An idiot!

712
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:06,050
-你又不知道她是谁 -我有她的照片
- You don't know who she was. - I have a picture of her.

713
01:13:06,230 --> 01:13:12,570
你看，西雅图的侦探社给我的 在这里，一模一样
The detective sent it to me. See, that's what she looks like.

714
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:18,570
-这是张背影 -是她，而他迷恋她
- It's her back. - It's her and he's crazy about her.

715
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:23,660
这是什么？ 西雅图寄来的
What's this? It's from Seattle.

716
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:33,420
贝琪
Becky.

717
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:37,970
我替你把信寄了
So I mailed your letter.

718
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:44,720
“亲爱的安妮 谢谢你的来信，你似乎很正点”
"Dear Annie. Thanks for your letter. You sound neat.

719
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:54,360
“我们很高兴情人节与你见面 并看看是否…”
We're excited about meeting you in New York and seeing if we are...

720
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:57,820
“MFEO”
...M-F-E-O.

721
01:13:57,990 --> 01:14:02,200
“再见 西雅图夜未眠”
See you soon. Sleepless in Seattle."

722
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:05,160
MFEO？
M-F-E-O?

723
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:11,830
是彼此合适
Made for each other.

724
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:15,170
蛮俏皮的
It's cute. Like a little clue.

725
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:23,130
他文笔奇差，无所谓啦
So he can't write. Big deal.

726
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:28,980
语文能力被过分重视 多要求是自寻苦恼
Verbal ability is overrated in guys. Our need for it leads to trouble.

727
01:14:29,150 --> 01:14:34,190
-我要回去找华特 -那这封信呢？
- I'm going to run back to Walter. - And the letter?

728
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:39,150
信是之前写的 是认识那女人前写的
It was written before I went out there. Before the 'ho.

729
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:48,780
问题是她看来不像个坏女人 倒像是个亲切的朋友
But she didn't look like a 'ho. She looked like one of our friends.

730
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:58,300
-你在机场看到她的？ -仿佛我早就认识她，奇怪
- You saw her in the airport too? - It was like I knew her.

731
01:14:58,470 --> 01:15:03,890
-像似曾相识？ -非常法式似曾相识的情节
- Like a d茅j脿-vu? - It was very d茅j脿-vu-ish.

732
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:09,730
-至少你开始约会了 -就这么一个
- At least you're seeing people. - Well, only one.

733
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:14,020
-维多莉亚 -你不喜欢她？
- Victoria. - You don't like her?

734
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:19,490
-她笑起来像土狼 -是吗？
- She laughs like a hyena. - Is this true?

735
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:23,820
没有…有一点 说出你干的好事
Sort of. Tell them what you did.

736
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,240
电台的事，说呀
Tell them about the radio show.

737
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:31,160
平安夜那天 他打电话给电台
Christmas Eve he calls a radio show.

738
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:38,210
-说我需要新老婆 -真的？好感人
- And tells them I need a new wife. - That's so sweet.

739
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:42,470
现在又有一个 迷人的女人来信
Now he's obsessed with a woman who wrote me.

740
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,220
她约我在帝国大厦顶楼见面
She wants to meet me on top of Empire State.

741
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,850
在情人节时
On Valentines Day.

742
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:53,640
就像那部电影《An Affair to Remember》没看过吗？
It's like that movie. An Affair to Remember.

743
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:58,910
加里·格兰特和黛博拉·范儿 是儿还是尔？
Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. Is that "car" or "cur"?

744
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:07,990
他们约好在帝国大厦 顶楼见面，但她被车撞了
They were to meet at the Empire State, but she got hit by a taxi.

745
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:13,040
他等了又等 那天下着雨
He waited and waited. And it was raining.

746
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:19,680
结果… 她太好强，不想让他知道自己…
Then she's too proud to tell him that she's...

747
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:27,930
跛了，他也倔强地 不肯找出她不来的原因
...crippled. And he's too proud to find out why she doesn't come.

748
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:31,970
但他还是去找她
But he comes to see her anyway.

749
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:36,860
他去找她时…
It's amazing when he visits her.

750
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:41,740
没注意她未起身寒暄
He doesn't notice that she doesn't get up to say hello.

751
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:45,150
他句句讽刺
And he's very bitter.

752
01:16:45,330 --> 01:16:50,200
当他准备走掉 不知道她为何…
You think he's going to walk out and never know why.

753
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:58,590
一直盖着毯子蜷在沙发上
She's just lying there with a blanket over her shrivelled legs.

754
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:03,890
-你还好吧？ -她没事
- Are you all right? - She's fine.

755
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:10,520
他突然说…我看到画了 他走到卧房
Then he says, "I saw the painting," and goes into the bedroom.

756
01:17:10,690 --> 01:17:14,650
看一眼，出来，再看着她
And he comes out and looks at her.

757
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:19,320
他发现了，两人相拥
And they just know and hug and it's so...

758
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:23,110
-那是女人看的电影 -对啊
- That's a chick's movie. - I'd say so.

759
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:29,160
-谁会听听广播就写信来？ -有好几百封呢
- Who'd write a guy from the radio? - I got hundreds of letters.

760
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:34,050
-饥不择食 -要个好男人，怎算是饥不择食？
- Desperate women. - Is wanting a nice guy desperate?

761
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:39,680
超过四十岁要结婚 比被恐怖份子杀死的机率还低…
It's easier to be killed by terrorists than to marry over 40.

762
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:44,260
-胡说八道 -是，甜心
- That is not true! - Right, honey.

763
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:49,900
我不要邮寄新娘 我只想找个人
I don't want a mail-order bride. Just someone who can converse...

764
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:55,900
可以边吃饭边聊 不会因电影而大哭
...without falling into weepy tears over an old movie.

765
01:17:56,070 --> 01:18:02,110
看《The Dirty Dozen》结尾时我有哭 吉米·布朗丢手榴弹
I cried over The Dirty Dozen. Jim Brown throwing the grenades.

766

801
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:17,320
你变得有点分心

但现在 你好像又回头了

我只是…我有点… 我想我有点紧张

我怕正正得负
I was afraid we'd be two rights making a wrong.

好像是命运，其实不然 你知道我的意思吧
You know, it was like kismet, but not, if you see what I mean.

812
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:20,920
你得成长，却不能 保有对生命的憧景
You have to grow up and forget the adolescent fantasies about...

813
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:25,640
别怪我，我喜欢这花色
...how exciting life will be. I'm sorry, but I love this pattern.

814
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:30,560

816
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:43,990

也会选这一只
...if I had every ring in the world to choose from.

懂吗？有些人希望 感情充满惊喜
Some people want a relationship to be full of surprises...

822
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:40,500
但我绝对不是

823
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:45,730
惊喜已被高估
Surprises are highly overrated.
