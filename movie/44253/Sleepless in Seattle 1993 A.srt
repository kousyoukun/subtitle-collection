00:00:05,031 --> 00:00:09,673
Well I think I'm going crazy. Dennis. I really do. Are you happily married?

2
00:00:10,026 --> 00:00:16,143
What?----I mean. why did you get married? Was it all trumpets and fireworks. and...

3
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:20,435
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married. So we got married.

4
00:00:20,778 --> 00:00:28,935
But when you first met her. did you believe that she was the only person for you. that in some mystical. cosmic way it was fated?

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:37,163
Annie. when you're attracted to someone it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious. subconsciously.

6
00:00:37,696 --> 00:00:41,687
So what we think of as fate. is just two neuroses. knowing they're a perfect match.

7
00:00:42,182 --> 00:00:51,615
I don't even know him. I am having all these fantasies about some man I have never even met who lives in Seattle.

8
00:00:52,102 --> 00:00:54,345
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle. 

9
00:00:54,684 --> 00:01:05,046
I know, I know! I do not want to move to Seattle! But what I really don't want to do is end up. 

10
00:01:05,378 --> 00:01:09,853
always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think? 

11
00:01:10,126 --> 00:01:17,914
It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everybody panics before they get married, I mean, I didn't you? ------Yes, I did. 

12
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:23,953
Yes, you did. Thank you very much, Dennis. I feel so much better just having blown this off. ------Anytime.
