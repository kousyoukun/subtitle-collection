1
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:42,125
Mommy got sick.

2
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,128
It happened just like that.

3
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,507
There was nothing anybody could do.

4
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,592
It isn't fair.

5
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,636
There's no reason.

6
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,891
But if we start asking why,
we'll go crazy.

7
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:25,836
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one
of them. They're done. Ready to eat.

8
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,339
Do you know how to make juice?

9
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,054
Microwave. Five minutes.

10
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,365
Here.

11
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,951
My shrink. Call him.

12
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:09,338
"Loss of Spouse Support Group.

13
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,259
Chicago Cancer Family Network.

14
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,887
Parents Without Partners.
Partners Without Parents.

15
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,057
Hug Yourself. Hug a Friend.
Hug a Shrink."

16
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,100
Or work. Work hard.

17
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:27,439
Work will save you. Work is the only
thing that will see you through this.

18
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,239
Don't mind him. He's just a guy
who's lost his wife.

19
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,874
What I think we really
need is a change.

20
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:50,087
Good idea. Take a couple of weeks off.
Get some sun. Take Jonah fishing.

21
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,884
No, a real change.

22
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:58,929
A new city.

23
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:03,600
Someplace where every time I go around
a corner I don't think of Maggie.

24
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,609
<i>Where you gonna go?</i>

25
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,200
I was thinking about Seattle.

26
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:24,997
Eventually, in a few months,
you'll start seeing women.

27
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,040
-You'll meet someone.
-Right.

28
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,710
Move on. Right.
That's what I'm gonna do.

29
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,629
And then in a few months, boom, I'll
be fine. I'll just grow a new heart.

30
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,882
-Sam, I'm sorry.
-She didn't mean that.

31
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:38,969
I know. Look,
it just doesn't happen twice.

32
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,848
<i>You must remember this</i>

33
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,851
<i>A kiss is still a kiss</i>

34
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,062
<i>A sigh is just a sigh</i>

35
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:56,904
<i>The fundamental things apply</i>

36
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,531
<i>As time goes by</i>

37
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,747
<i>And when two lovers woo</i>

38
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,708
<i>They still say, I love you</i>

39
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,753
<i>On that you can rely</i>

40
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:20,761
<i>No matter what the future brings</i>

41
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,597
<i>As time goes by</i>

42
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,854
<i>Moonlight and love songs</i>

43
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,732
<i>Never out of date</i>

44
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,318
<i>Hearts full of passion</i>

45
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,530
<i>Jealousy and hate</i>

46
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,949
<i>Woman needs man</i>

47
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,826
<i>And man must have his mate</i>

48
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,373
<i>That no one can deny</i>

49
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,544
<i>It's still the same old story</i>

50
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,547
<i>A fight for love and glory</i>

51
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,591
<i>A case of do or die</i>

52
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:07,474
<i>The world will
always welcome lovers</i>

53
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,270
<i>As time</i>

54
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:15,274
<i>Goes by</i>

55
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,707
<i>The tall one with red hair
is your cousin Irene.</i>

56
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,959
You'll recognize her by
the disappointed look on her face.

57
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,254
Who was married to Harold
who ran off with his secretary.

58
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,049
But came back because Irene threatened
to put the dog to sleep if he didn't.

59
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:44,553
Your brother Dennis
is a professor at Johns Hopkins.

60
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,474
He's married to Betsy.

61
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,894
The most competitive woman
in the world.

62
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,896
I don't see how
I'm gonna remember all this.

63
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,607
Oh, well, Walter, you will.

64
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,038
Your Uncle Milton
lost all of his money...

65
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,333
-And some other people's.
-In a pyramid scheme.

66
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,753
Don't mention the IRS
or the federal prison system.

67
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:21,548
Your mother's Barbara.
Your father's Cliff.

68
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:25,719
-My father has electric trains.
-Really?

69
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,931
Am I what they had in mind?

70
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:32,059
Oh, Walter,
they're gonna love you.

71
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,563
<i>Everybody.</i>

72
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:39,107
Annie has an announcement.

73
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:44,571
Walter and I are engaged.

74
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,620
Thank you. Thank you.

75
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,123
Dad, Mom knew.

76
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:58,544
-I don't see a ring, Annie.
-I don't have a ring yet.

77
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,546
Congratulations.

78
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,675
Bless you. Bless you.

79
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,262
-Oh, my goodness.
-Are you all right?

80
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,348
-It's nothing.
-Maybe it's the flowers.

81
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,268
-We'll move them.
-No! Don't touch them!

82
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,770
I feel terrible,
sneezing at a time like this.

83
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:18,897
This is a very
important moment for me.

84
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,024
<i>He's allergic to everything.
Don't worry about it.</i>

85
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:24,194
Bees. I'm allergic to bees.

86
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:27,239
Harold is allergic
to every type of bee.

87
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:31,243
We always have to carry a hypodermic
of adrenaline wherever we go.

88
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,745
If he eats even
one tiny piece of a nut...

89
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,249
My head swells up like
a watermelon, and I drop dead.

90
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,043
It's the same
with Harold and bees.

91
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:44,590
Your mother and I had salmon at our
wedding. A wedding without cold salmon...

92
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,634
-I'm not allergic to salmon.
-Oh, he's not allergic to salmon.

93
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:50,262
I don't think,
but you never know.

94
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:53,932
-You never know.
-Harold wasn't always allergic to bees.

95
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:57,936
Honey, what a shame. We had
some champagne. What did we use it for?

96
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,272
<i>-Uncle Milton's parole.
-And it was delicious.</i>

97
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,065
It was, wasn't it, Milton?

98
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,151
When are you getting married?

99
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,487
-In early June, in the garden.
-Does it have to be in the garden?

100
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:11,241
-What a great idea.
-What about Harold and bees?

101
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:14,661
-I'm allergic to bees.
-We'll spray you.

102
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:18,582
Cold salmon, a lovely
cucumber salad, strawberries.

103
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:22,127
I'm afraid I am allergic
to strawberries.

104
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,421
Allergic to strawberries.

105
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:27,633
Is this all right
with you, Walter?

106
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,093
Today I consider myself
the luckiest...

107
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,931
m-m-man on the f-f-face
of the -E-Earth.

108
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:37,267
The Lou Gehrig line.
Remember? Remember, Dad?

109
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,561
<i>-The Lou Gehrig line from...
-Pride of the Yankees.</i>

110
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,772
<i>-Pride of the Yankees!
-Pride of the Yankees.</i>

111
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:45,317
-It's baseball.
-A historical reference.

112
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:50,197
I would like to propose a toast
to my kid sister.

113
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,033
To Walter and my baby.

114
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:56,036
To Walter and Annie.

115
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:01,625
Everyone, please eat
before it gets cold.

116
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,963
Here it is.

117
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:10,092
The historical society wanted this,
and I never would give it to them.

118
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,344
<i>Oh, Mom!</i>

119
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,097
I noticed these things
are back in fashion.

120
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,560
-Grandmother's dress.
-Oh, honey.

121
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:22,104
He's a lovely man, Annie.

122
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:27,276
I know. He is wonderful, isn't he?
And he's such a wonderful athlete.

123
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,486
-Are his folks nice?
-You'll love them.

124
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,489
We're going down to D.C. Tonight
to be with them Christmas morning.

125
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:36,743
-How did it happen?
-Well, it's silly, really.

126
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,746
I'd seen him at the office.
Obviously, I'd seen him.

127
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,748
He's the associate publisher.

128
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:45,711
<i>One day we both ordered sandwiches
from the same place.</i>

129
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:50,007
He got my lettuce and tomato on wheat,
which, of course, he was allergic to.

130
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,342
And I got his lettuce
and tomato on white.

131
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,803
-How amazing.
-It is, isn't it?

132
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:57,014
You make a million decisions
that mean nothing.

133
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,808
Then one day you order takeout,
and it changes your life.

134
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:02,019
Destiny takes a hand.

135
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,688
Mom, destiny is
something we've invented...

136
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:08,567
because we can't stand the fact that
everything that happens is accidental.

137
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,947
How do you explain that you both ordered
the same sandwich except for the bread?

138
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:17,409
How many people in this world
like lettuce and tomato...

139
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,412
without something else like tuna?

140
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:25,209
Well, it wasn't a sign.
It was a coincidence.

141
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:29,379
I was in Atlantic City with my family.
Cliff was a waiter.

142
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:34,218
He wasn't even supposed to work
that night, and suppose he hadn't?

143
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:38,055
He asked me to take a midnight walk
on the Steel Pier.

144
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:42,601
I've probably told you this
a million times, but I don't care.

145
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,103
Then he held my hand.

146
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:47,481
At one point I looked down
and I couldn't tell...

147
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,817
which fingers were his
and which were mine.

148
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,737
And I knew.

149
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,241
-What?
-You know.

150
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:00,702
-What?
-Magic.

151
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:03,413
It was magic.

152
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,040
Magic?

153
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:09,294
I knew we'd be together forever and
that everything would be wonderful...

154
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:12,130
just the way you feel about Walter.

155
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:17,261
Walter? It's quite
a formal name, isn't it?

156
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,848
One of the things I truly knew
was that your father and I...

157
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:23,642
were going to have
a wonderful time in...

158
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:27,062
-The sack, I believe you call it.
-Mom!

159
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,439
Of course, it took
several years before everything...

160
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,441
worked like clockwork
in that department.

161
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,527
So don't be worried
if it takes a while.

162
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,072
-Well, we already...
-Fine. Fine. Fiddle-de-dee.

163
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,200
-How's it working?
-Like clockwork.

164
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,495
Oh, honey.

165
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:50,294
<i>-It's a sign.
-You don't believe in signs.</i>

166
00:11:55,924 --> 00:12:00,554
They loved you! I told you they
would love you, and they loved you!

167
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,348
-I love you.
-I love you, Walter.

168
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:08,896
Did anyone ever call you
anything other than Walter?

169
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,315
Nope.

170
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,358
Not even when you were young?

171
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,694
Nope, not even when I was young.

172
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,531
You sure you don't
want to drive with me?

173
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:22,492
How will I get back
to Baltimore on Friday?

174
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:26,997
I forgot the present. I left your
stepmother's present inside by accident.

175
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,292
When we're old and gray, you're gonna
have to remind me to put my teeth in.

176
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:35,005
I'll be walking all over town, smacking
my gums together and not even noticing.

177
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,175
-I'll wait.
-You'll wait? Oh! Right.

178
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,345
Don't wait. It's silly.
Go ahead. We're late anyway.

179
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,639
I'll be ten minutes behind you.

180
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,017
<i>Sleigh bells jing-a-ling
Ring-ting-ting-a-ling too</i>

181
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:49,019
<i>Horses, horses, horses</i>

182
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,063
<i>It's lovely weather
for a sleigh ride together with you</i>

183
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,065
<i>Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap</i>

184
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,193
<i>The snow is falling
and friends are calling, Yoo-hoo</i>

185
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:59,446
<i>Friends are calling, Yoo-hoo
Ding-a-ling-a-ling</i>

186
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,199
<i>Horses, horses, horses
Horses, horses, horses</i>

187
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:03,867
<i>Horses, horses, horses</i>

188
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:07,579
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way</i>

189
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:11,750
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh</i>

190
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,836
<i>Jingle bells</i>

191
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,255
<i>-Horses, horses, horses
-Welcome to "You and Your Emotions."</i>

192
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,298
<i>-Laughing all the way
-I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone....</i>

193

<i>broadcasting live across America from
the top of the Sears Tower in Chicago.</i>

194
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,015
<i>Tonight we're talking
about wishes and dreams.</i>

195
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:29,685
<i>-What's your wish this Christmas Eve?
-What's your wish?</i>

196
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:33,438
<i>-Maybe the best gift you can give your...
-My wish is to turn the radio station.</i>

197
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:37,401
<i>Subject of this evening's medical update
is "You and Your Spleen."</i>

198
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,111
<i>-Your host is--
-Not on your life.</i>

199
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:43,824
<i>Coming up, "Jingle Bells" backwards,
sung by the New Jersey...</i>

200
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:48,162
<i>-Seattle, go ahead.
-Hello, this is Jonah...</i>

201
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,830
<i>No last names, Jonah.</i>

202
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:53,250
<i>You sound younger than
our usual callers. How old are you?</i>

203
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:56,170
<i>-I'm eight.
-Eight. How come you're up so late?</i>

204
00:13:56,253 --> 00:14:00,007
<i>-It's not that late in Seattle.
-Of course. You're absolutely right.</i>

205
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,301
<i>What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?</i>

206
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:06,346
<i>It's not for me. It's for my dad.
I think he needs a new wife.</i>

207
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,183
<i>-You don't like the one he has now?
-He doesn't have one now.</i>

208
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:10,851
<i>That's the problem.</i>

209
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:13,395
<i>-Where's your mom?
-She died.</i>

210
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:18,275
<i>-I'm so sorry to hear that.
-Well, who can believe this?</i>

211
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:21,361
<i>I've been pretty sad,
but I think my dad's worse.</i>

212
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,989
<i>Have you talked
to your dad about this?</i>

213
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,283
<i>-No.
-Why not?</i>

214
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:29,912
<i>-It's like it makes him sadder.
-I can understand that.</i>

215
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,581
<i>-Jonah, is your dad home right now?
-Yeah.</i>

216
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:36,293
<i>-What's he doing? Is he busy?
-Not really. He's out on the deck.</i>

217
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:40,631
<i>I'm sure that I can help, but I'm
going to need you to help me help him.</i>

218
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,799
<i>-Wretched woman!
-Bring your dad to the phone.</i>

219
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:46,470
<i>-Hang up, Jonah! Don't listen to her.
-No way. He'd kill me.</i>

220
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:49,097
<i>Trust me, Jonah.
He won't be angry...</i>

221
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:51,683
<i>when he realizes
how concerned you are about him.</i>

222
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,185
Wanna bet?

223
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:56,146
<i>If I get yelled at, I'm never
going to listen to your show again.</i>

224
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:58,482
<i>Fair enough.</i>

225
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:02,152
-Dad?
-Yeah?

226
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:05,405
There's someone
on the phone for you.

227
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:10,494
<i>-His name's Sam.
-Sam.</i>

228
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,539
<i>If you've just tuned in,
this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone.</i>

229
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,666
<i>Tonight's topic is
"Your Wishes and Dreams."</i>

230
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:19,503
<i>-I got it.
-We're on the line with Seattle.</i>

231
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:21,088
<i>-Hello?
-Hello, Sam.</i>

232
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,882
<i>This is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone
on Network America.</i>

233
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:29,346
What are you selling tonight?
Micro hibachis or Ginza knives?

234
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:32,683
<i>I'm not selling anything.
I just want to help.</i>

235
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,685
<i>I want you to know
that your son called...</i>

236
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:38,689
<i>and he asked me for advice
on how you might find a new wife.</i>

237
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:44,111
<i>-Who is this?
-Dr. Fieldstone of Network America.</i>

238
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:47,114
<i>-You are on the air.
-You called a radio station?</i>

239
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:51,952
<i>-Sam? Sam? Sam, are you with me?
-Yeah. Yes.</i>

240
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:56,248
<i>Your son feels that since your wife's
death you've been very, very unhappy.</i>

241
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:59,877
<i>He's genuinely worried about you.</i>

242
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,421
Oh, hey, get out here.
Get out here.

243
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,798
I'm not gonna
go through this alone.

244
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:08,927
<i>I think it's very hard for him
to talk to you about all this.</i>

245
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:12,723
<i>I thought maybe you and I could talk.
It would make Jonah feel better.</i>

246
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:16,310
<i>-Sam?
-Talk to her, Dad. She's a doctor.</i>

247
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:19,313
Of what?
Her first name could be Doctor.

248
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,899
<i>-Please?
-Sam?</i>

249
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:25,527
<i>Sam, it's his Christmas wish.</i>

250
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:29,406
<i>-Okay.
-Okay, good.</i>

251
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:31,992
<i>I know this is difficult.</i>

252
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:35,078
<i>But how long ago
did your wife die?</i>

253
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,664
About a year and a half ago.

254
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:40,792
<i>Have you had
any relationships since?</i>

255
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,963
<i>-Nope.
-No?</i>

256
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:46,840
<i>Why not?</i>

257
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:51,637
Marcia... Or should
I call you Dr. Fieldstone?

258
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,223
<i>-Dr. Marcia.
-Dr. Marcia.</i>

259
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:58,644
<i>-I don't mean to be rude.
-I don't want to invade your privacy.</i>

260
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,063
<i>-Oh, sure you do.
-Sure you do.</i>

261
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:04,441
<i>Go on, Sam.
I'm listening.</i>

262
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,360
<i>Sam?</i>

263
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:11,949
We had a pretty
tough time there at first.

264
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,618
But we're dealing with it.

265
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:19,706
And Jonah and I will
get along just fine again...

266
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,835
as soon as I break his radio.

267
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:27,339
<i>I have no doubt that
you're a wonderful father.</i>

268
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:31,176
<i>-You can tell a lot from a voice.
-You certainly can.</i>

269
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,931
<i>But something must be missing if
Jonah still feels you're under a cloud.</i>

270
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:39,309
<i>Just a few questions.
Are you sleeping at night?</i>

271
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:42,479
-He doesn't sleep at all.
-How do you know that?

272
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:44,314
I live here.

273
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:51,405
Look, it's Christmas.

274
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,829
Maggie, my wife...

275
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:01,373
She really did it.

276
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,375
I mean, she loved...

277
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:06,920
She made everything beautiful.

278
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:12,885
<i>And it's just tough
this time of year.</i>

279
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,678
Any kid needs a mother.

280
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,516
<i>Could it be that you need someone
just as much as Jonah does?</i>

281
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:23,812
Yes.

282
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:27,232
<i>Don't answer that. Let's get into that
right after these messages.</i>

283
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:29,568
<i>Sam, Jonah, don't go away.</i>

284
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:33,947
<i>If you've just tuned in,
we're talking to Sleepless in Seattle.</i>

285
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:38,118
<i>We'll be right back after this break
with your listener response.</i>

286
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:40,037
What's she talking about?

287
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:43,207
This is when other people get to call in
and dump on what you said.

288
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:48,795
Oh, oh. This is really fun,
and helpful.

289
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,012
I'll bet he's tall
with a cute butt.

290
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,431
Bet he hasn't bathed in weeks
and he stinks.

291
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:01,892
Harriet, shut up.
Hi. Can I help you?

292
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:03,727
Tea with the bag out.

293
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:07,731
Maybe I'll hustle myself out to Seattle.
Give him a gift for New Year's Eve.

294
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:11,151
You go on out there if you want to,
but don't open his refrigerator.

295
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:14,112
They don't cover anything
when they put it in the fridge.

296
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:16,698
They just stick it in there and
leave it till it walks out by itself.

297
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:20,327
What I'm saying is, I wouldn't kick this
guy out of my bed for eating crackers.

298
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,329
You know what I'm saying?
Sixty-five cents.

299
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:26,083
<i>Let's take a call
before we get back to Sleepless.</i>

300
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:29,253
<i>Knoxville, Tennessee,
you're on the air. Talk to me.</i>

301
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:34,091
<i>Yes, I would just like to know
where I could get this man's address.</i>

302
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,343
<i>-Honey, get in line.
-We don't give that information.</i>

303
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,095
<i>Next caller, go ahead.</i>

304
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:42,683
<i>If there was one question
I was allowed to ask...</i>

305
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,977
Oh, go ahead.

306
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,147
<i>People who truly loved once
are far more likely to love again.</i>

307
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:53,652
<i>Do you think there's someone out there
you could love as much as your wife?</i>

308
00:19:56,363 --> 00:20:00,576
<i>Well, Dr. Marcia Fieldstone,
that's hard to imagine.</i>

309
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:03,996
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

310
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:09,126
Well, I'm going to get
out of bed every morning...

311
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:11,461
breathe in and out all day long.

312
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:16,383
<i>Then after a while
I won't have to remind myself...</i>

313
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:20,637
<i>to get out of bed in the morning
and breathe in and out.</i>

314
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:26,560
And then after a while
I won't have to think about how...

315
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:29,813
I had it great and perfect
for a while.

316
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:34,651
<i>Sam, tell me what was
so special about your wife?</i>

317
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:37,321
<i>Well, how long is your program?</i>

318
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:42,868
<i>Oh, well, it was a...</i>

319
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,870
<i>It was a million
tiny little things.</i>

320
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:50,000
<i>When you added them all up, it just
meant we were supposed to be together.</i>

321
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:54,213
<i>And I knew it. I knew it
the very first time I touched her.</i>

322
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:57,257
It was like coming home...

323
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:00,511
only to no home I'd ever known.

324
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:03,597
I was just taking her hand...

325
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,017
to help her out of a car...

326
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:08,602
and I knew it.

327
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:12,272
<i>It was like...</i>

328
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:14,942
<i>-Magic.
-Magic.</i>

329
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:18,654
<i>Well, folks,
it's time to wrap it up.</i>

330
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:21,365
<i>I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone
in Chicago.</i>

331
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:25,911
<i>And to all my listeners,
a magical and merry Christmas.</i>

332
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:30,916
<i>And to you, Sleepless in Seattle,
we hope you'll call again soon.</i>

333
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:34,211
<i>-Let us know how it's going.
-Oh, you can count on it.</i>

334
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:39,883
<i>When you find me</i>

335
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:44,555
<i>I know somewhere</i>

336
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:50,102
<i>Over the rainbow</i>

337
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:56,775
<i>The bluebirds glide</i>

338
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:04,658
<i>Birds fly</i>

339
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:09,079
<i>Over the rainbow</i>

340
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:14,418
<i>Why, then, oh, why</i>

341
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:18,797
<i>Can't I</i>

342
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:27,055
This man sells the greatest soup
you've ever eaten...

343
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:29,308
and he is the meanest man
in America.

344
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:33,020
I feel very strongly about this, Becky.
It's not just about the soup.

345
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:35,230
-Do it. What else?
-New Year's Eve.

346
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:37,774
<i>-Please don't make me write it.
-Listen to this.</i>

347
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:40,944
"Phone service in the greater Chicago
area was tied up for two hours...

348
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:43,530
Christmas Eve when some kid
calls a phone-in radio show...

349
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:45,532
and says that his dad
needs a new wife.

350
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:50,037
Two thousand women called the station
asking for the guy's number."

351
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,373
I heard it. This kid calls up
and says, "My dad needs a wife."

352
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:57,044
This shrink forces the guy to the phone
and says, You want to talk about it?"

353
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:59,630
He says, No,
as a matter of fact, I don't."

354
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:02,799
Suddenly, for no reason at all, he talks
about how much he loved his wife...

355
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:04,843
and how he just
fell in love with her...

356
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:06,887
like he was one
of those cows in Michigan.

357
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,057
<i>-What cows in Michigan?
-It was on 60 Minutes.</i>

358
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,309
There were those cows
that got zapped by stray voltage.

359
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:15,020
No one knows why.
Maybe it was Wisconsin.

360
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:19,399
But anyway, I was listening to him
talk about how much he loved his wife...

361
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:21,902
and suddenly I was crying.

362
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:24,238
It's like what happens when
I watch those phone company ads.

363
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:26,323
I don't have to see the whole thing,
just the part where...

364
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,368
the daughter gives the mother the
refrigerator with the big red bow on it.

365
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:33,580
The Polaroid commercial. Two 5-year-olds
at their grandfather's birthday party.

366
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:35,582
-They're making the album.
-With the glue.

367
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:38,335
That kills me.

368
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,879
You should write
something about this.

369
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:43,465
-About what?
-Whatever it is.

370
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:47,302
I'll tell you. Two thousand women
calling a radio station for a husband.

371
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:49,304
There are a lot of desperate women
out there lookin' for love.

372
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:51,306
Especially over a certain age.

373
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,601
It's easier to be killed by a terrorist
than get married over the age of 40.

374
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:56,603
That is not true.
That statistic is not true.

375
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:58,856
That's right. It's not true.
But it feels true.

376
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:00,858
It feels true
because it is true.

377
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:03,569
There's practically a whole book
about how that's not true.

378
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:06,697
-Calm down. You brought it up.
-I did not, Wyatt.

379
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:09,950
-Did you even read that book?
-Did anyone read it all the way through?

380
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:13,120
Are you two finished?
Fine. Now where were we?

381
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:17,374
If someone is a widower,
why do they say that he was widowed?

382
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:20,210
Why don't they say
he was widowered?

383
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:24,798
I was just wondering.

384
00:24:24,882 --> 00:24:26,842
What was that about up there?

385
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:29,845
-What was what?
-What's with you?

386
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:33,724
-Nothing's with me.
-Something's with you.

387
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:37,269
-What are you saying?
-Whatever it is, you can tell me.

388
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:38,854
Sleepless in Seattle?

389
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:41,565
That's what she called him on the show
because he can't sleep.

390
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:44,735
And now 2,000 women
want his number.

391
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:47,237
The guy could be a crackhead,
a transvestite...

392
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:50,574
a flasher, a junkie,
a chain-saw murderer...

393
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:53,785
or someone really sick,
someone like my Rick.

394
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:58,582
-Actually, he sounded nice.
-Oh?

395
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:04,004
Oh, really?
Now we're getting down to it.

396
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:07,007
Please. Becky,
I'm madly in love with Walter.

397
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,260
He did the craziest thing
the other night. What was that?

398
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:16,266
Oh, it was so funny.
We were hysterical. What was that?

399
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:33,158
You know, I've got to go to Boston
for the convention, right?

400
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,453
Then I got to visit Winston-Hughes
about switching over our computers.

401
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:41,959
<i>But why don't we meet in New York
for Valentine's Day weekend?</i>

402
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:45,170
Walter, I'd love to!

403
00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:47,965
We can stay at the Plaza.

404
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:50,425
Ice-stake in Central Park.

405
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:52,761
Register.

406
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:54,555
Register?

407
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:59,268
You know, for dishes,
glasses, silver, everything.

408
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:03,230
How about it?

409
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:09,361
I'll take you to Chinatown
for dim sum.

410
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:12,406
-Does it have wheat in it?
-I don't think so.

411
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:18,912
<i>Dim sum, dim sum</i>

412
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:25,752
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

413
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:30,174
five, four, three, two, one!

414
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:34,845
Hey, Jonah. Wake up. Wake up, man.
The ball's droppin'.

415
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:36,471
<i>Happy new year!</i>

416
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:46,356
<i>Okay, pal. I got ya.</i>

417
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:47,691
It's okay.

418
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:49,776
There we go.

419
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:25,521
Happy new year.

420
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:27,564
Happy new year.

421
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:33,070
Kiss Howard.

422
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:35,239
Good night, Howard.

423
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:54,758
<i>Sometimes I wonder</i>

424
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:58,011
<i>Why I spend</i>

425
00:27:58,095 --> 00:28:02,432
<i>The lonely night</i>

426
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:05,978
<i>Dreaming of a song</i>

427
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:08,647
<i>The melody</i>

428
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,317
<i>Haunts my reverie</i>

429
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:17,614
<i>And I am once again with you</i>

430
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:21,285
<i>When our love was new</i>

431
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:27,040
<i>And each kiss an inspiration</i>

432
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:34,214
<i>But that was long ago</i>

433
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:38,218
<i>Now my consolation</i>

434
00:28:38,302 --> 00:28:43,182
<i>Is in the stardust of a song</i>

435
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:48,854
<i>Beside the garden wall</i>

436
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:53,275
<i>When stars are bright</i>

437
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:56,862
<i>You are in my arms</i>

438
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:59,823
<i>The nightingale</i>

439
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:03,285
<i>Tells his fairy tale</i>

440
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:07,331
<i>Of paradise where roses bloom</i>

441
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:09,500
Can I have half your beer?

442
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:12,794
Sure. Go ahead.

443
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:18,050
What did I used to say?

444
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,302
"Here's looking at you"?

445
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:22,304
"Here's mud in your eye"?

446
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:24,681
"Here's to us."

447
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:29,102
You used to say, Here's to us."

448
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:36,944
Oh, babe.
I miss you so much it hurts.

449
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,463
-What do you want to do?
-We'll tell him when he gets here.

450
00:29:56,547 --> 00:29:58,799
You want to tell him.
I don't mind telling him.

451
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:01,593
-She's here.
-She's back. She has another idea.

452
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:03,637
I don't need...
Claire, how are you?

453
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,348
I'm so glad you're here.
I heard you on the radio.

454
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:09,935
-I told everyone about it.
-We already knew.

455
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:11,270
-How did you...
-Grace.

456
00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:13,522
The dispatcher?
All of Seattle knows.

457
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:16,024
I was brushing my teeth
and suddenly there you were.

458
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:19,194
I couldn't believe my ears.
I called my mother in Las Vegas.

459
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:24,074
I said, Mother, turn on the radio.
That's my architect."

460
00:30:24,158 --> 00:30:26,994
It is so nice...

461
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:30,455
when a man
can express his feelings.

462
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:33,417
-It's wonderful.
-I wish I could express my feelings.

463
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,755
-So, Claire, is there a problem?
-I was tossing and turning last night.

464
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:44,094
I realized I'm never going to fit my
platters in the refrigerator we ordered.

465
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:46,597
When I give parties,
I always put in platters.

466
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:50,017
So I thought I would get the Sub-Zero
refrigerator instead. The only problem...

467
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,019
We have to redo all the cabinets.

468
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:55,480
-We'll be into this wall.
-That's a bearing wall.

469
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:57,900
That's a delay, Claire, of...

470
00:30:57,983 --> 00:30:59,902
-Two, three...
-Five, six...

471
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:01,945
-Twelve weeks.
-I don't mind.

472
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:04,490
The important thing
is to get it right.

473
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:06,533
-Absolutely.
-Your words.

474
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:09,328
<i>I've got to rush.
La decorateur calls.</i>

475
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:11,622
-Bye!
-Bye-bye.

476
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:17,461
Well, this is fate.
She's divorced.

477
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:19,713
We don't want to redo the cabinets,
and you need a wife.

478
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:22,466
What do they call that
when everything intersects?

479
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:24,510
The Bermuda Triangle.

480
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:37,773
And here's another one.
You got room for one more here?

481
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:39,816
There you go.
You all right there?

482
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,862
-Look at this, Dad. They're all for you.
-Yes, sir. There you go.

483
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:49,952
"Sleepless in Seattle.
In care of Dr. Marcia Fieldstone"?

484
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:54,748
If you have trouble sleeping, drink
a glass of water from the other side.

485
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:57,292
-I thought that was for hiccups.
-Does it work for hiccups?

486
00:31:57,376 --> 00:32:01,088
For hiccups, take a spoonful of sugar
and hold it in your mouth for a minute.

487
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:05,008
-Really?
-Thank you.

488
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:07,386
What possessed you
to give them our address?

489
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:10,556
They called and asked for it.

490
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:12,808
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle...

491
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:16,687
You're the most attractive man
I ever laid ears on."

492
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:20,399
Wait, wait, wait. They called?
How did they get our number?

493
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:22,568
Let me guess.
You gave it to them.

494
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:25,696
You have to give them your phone number,
or they won't let you on the air.

495
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:28,699
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle,
I live in Tulsa."

496
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,202
<i>-Where's that?
-It's in Oklahoma.</i>

497
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:35,038
-Do you know where Oklahoma is?
-Somewhere in the middle.

498
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,333
I'm not even gonna think about
what they're not teaching you in school.

499
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:40,878
Yeah, it's somewhere
in the middle.

500
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:46,049
Generally speaking, we should rule out
anyone that doesn't live near here.

501
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:47,926
She's willing to fly anywhere.

502
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:53,223
She looks like my third grade teacher.
I hated my third grade teacher.

503
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:57,352
Wait a minute.
She is my third grade teacher!

504
00:32:57,436 --> 00:33:02,232
-Aren't you gonna read any of these?
-This is not how it's done.

505
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:05,611
I'd much rather
just see somebody I like...

506
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:09,031
and get a feeling about them...

507
00:33:09,114 --> 00:33:11,241
and ask them
if they want to have a drink.

508
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:13,243
-Or a slice of pizza?
-Not dinner.

509
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:15,454
Not necessarily on the first date.

510
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:17,956
Halfway through dinner you could be
really sorry you asked them to dinner.

511
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,042
Whereas, if it's just a drink...

512
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:22,628
if you like them,
you could always ask them to dinner.

513
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:25,255
But if not, you can just say,
Well, that was great."

514
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:29,843
And then you go home.
See what I mean?

515
00:33:29,927 --> 00:33:32,095
I wonder if
it still works this way.

516
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:36,475
-It doesn't. They ask you.
-I'm starting to notice that.

517
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:41,146
<i>If you get a new wife, I guess
you'll have sex with her, huh?</i>

518
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,732
I certainly hope so.

519
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:48,237
-Will she scratch up your back?
-What?

520
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,075
In movies, women are always scratching
up the man's back and screaming.

521
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:56,036
-How do you know this?
-Jed's got cable.

522
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,288
Oh, Jed's got cable.

523
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:02,876
Hand me that towel
behind you, please.

524
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:09,508
-Thank you.
-I need it too.

525
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:13,303
Here. Let me get you.
Jed's got cable.

526
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:15,973
<i>Another bride</i>

527
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:18,684
<i>Another groom</i>

528
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:24,147
<i>Another sunny honeymoon</i>

529
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:26,984
<i>Another season</i>

530
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:31,697
<i>And that's the reason
for makin' whoopee</i>

531
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:51,717
<i>When the sun is high
in the afternoon sky</i>

532
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,180
<i>You can always
find something to do</i>

533
00:34:56,221 --> 00:35:02,144
<i>But from dusk till dawn
as the clock ticks on</i>

534
00:35:02,227 --> 00:35:08,984
<i>Something happens to you</i>

535
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:13,572
<i>In the wee small hours</i>

536
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:17,284
<i>Of the morning</i>

537
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:21,038
<i>While the whole wide world</i>

538
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:25,209
<i>Is fast asleep</i>

539
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:29,087
<i>You lie awake</i>

540
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:33,175
<i>And think about the boy</i>

541
00:35:33,258 --> 00:35:36,094
<i>And never ever think</i>

542
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:41,391
<i>Of counting sheep</i>

543
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:43,977
<i>Welcome back to
the ""Best of Dr. Marcia Fieldstone"...</i>

544
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:46,813
<i>clinical psychologist
and the friend you never had.</i>

545
00:35:46,897 --> 00:35:50,901
<i>-Remember Marooned in Miami?
-He says he doesn't love me anymore.</i>

546
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:53,946
<i>Why would you want to be
with someone who doesn't love you?</i>

547
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:55,989
<i>Disappointed in Denver.</i>

548
00:35:56,073 --> 00:36:00,160
<i>Every time I come close to orgasm,
he goes to make himself a sandwich.</i>

549
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:02,371
<i>Why don't you make him
a sandwich beforehand?</i>

550
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:04,373
<i>Sleepless in Seattle.</i>

551
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:09,795
<i>Well, I'm going to get
out of bed every morning....</i>

552
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:13,674
<i>and breathe in and out all day long.</i>

553
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:18,095
<i>Then after a while
I won't have to remind myself....</i>

554
00:36:18,178 --> 00:36:22,933
<i>to get out of bed in the morning
and breathe in and out.</i>

555
00:36:24,977 --> 00:36:29,940
<i>And then after a while
I won't have to think about how...</i>

556
00:36:29,982 --> 00:36:33,944
<i>I had it great and perfect
for a while.</i>

557
00:36:34,027 --> 00:36:38,740
<i>Sam, tell me what was
so special about your wife?</i>

558
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:41,785
<i>Well, how long is your program?</i>

559
00:36:43,412 --> 00:36:47,124
<i>Oh, well, it was a...</i>

560
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:49,168
<i>It was a million
tiny little things.</i>

561
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:54,173
<i>When you added them all up, it just
meant we were supposed to be together.</i>

562
00:36:54,256 --> 00:36:58,927
<i>And I knew it. I knew it
the very first time I touched her.</i>

563
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:01,346
<i>It was like coming home...</i>

564
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:04,641
<i>only to no home I'd ever known.</i>

565
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:07,728
<i>I was just taking her hand...</i>

566
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:10,480
<i>to help her out of a car...</i>

567
00:37:11,565 --> 00:37:13,817
<i>and I knew it.</i>

568
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:16,570
<i>It was like....</i>

569
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:18,572
<i>magic.</i>

570
00:37:40,052 --> 00:37:43,972
I think I'm going crazy, Dennis.
Are you happily married?

571
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:47,017
-What?
-I mean, why did you get married?

572
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:49,436
Was it all trumpets
and fireworks?

573
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,689
I got married because Betsy said
we had to break up or get married...

574
00:37:52,731 --> 00:37:54,441
so we got married.

575
00:37:55,317 --> 00:37:56,944
But when you first met her...

576
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:59,530
did you believe
she was the only person for you?

577
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:02,783
That in some mystical,
cosmic way it was fated?

578
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:06,703
Annie, when you're
attracted to someone...

579
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:09,706
it just means that your subconscious
is attracted to their subconscious...

580
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:11,625
subconsciously.

581
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:15,420
What we think of as fate is two neuroses
knowing they're a perfect match.

582
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:18,757
I don't even know him.

583
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:23,679
I am having all of these fantasies
about some man I have never even met...

584
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:25,764
who lives in Seattle!

585
00:38:25,848 --> 00:38:27,933
It rains nine months
of the year in Seattle.

586
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:32,980
I know! I know!
I do not want to move to Seattle.

587
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:39,361
But what I really don't want
to do is end up always wondering...

588
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:42,739
what might have happened
and knowing I could have done something.

589
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:45,033
What do you think?

590
00:38:45,117 --> 00:38:47,035
It's just cold feet, isn't it?

591
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,164
Everybody panics before
they get married. Didn't you?

592
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,916
-I did.
-You did.

593
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:56,336
Thank you very much, Dennis. I feel so
much better just having blown this off.

594
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,754
Anytime.

595
00:38:57,796 --> 00:39:01,675
Sandy has a girlfriend, Glenda.
She's a weight lifter.

596
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:03,760
It's not like her neck
is bigger than her head.

597
00:39:03,844 --> 00:39:07,890
I'm not asking you to set me up.
I don't need your help with that.

598
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:11,059
I just want to know
what it's like out there.

599
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:13,645
That's what I'm trying to tell you,
what women are lookin' for.

600
00:39:13,729 --> 00:39:16,231
Pecs and a cute butt.

601
00:39:16,315 --> 00:39:18,942
<i>-Like, "He has the cutest butt''?
-Yeah.</i>

602
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:21,862
-Where did I hear that recently?
-Everywhere.

603
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:24,615
You can't even turn on the news
nowadays without hearing about...

604
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:27,576
how some babe thought
some guy's butt was cute.

605
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:31,079
Who the first woman to say this was,
I don't know. But it caught on.

606
00:39:31,163 --> 00:39:33,332
So how's my butt?

607
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:37,920
-Not bad.
-Really?

608
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:39,963
-Is it cute though?
-I don't know.

609
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:42,049
Are we grading on a curve?

610
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:44,635
When's the last time
you were out there?

611
00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:50,849
Jimmy Carter, 1978.

612
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:55,187
Things are
a little different now.

613
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,649
First you have to be friends.
You have to like each other.

614
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:02,611
Then you neck.
This could go on for years.

615
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:05,280
Then you have tests.
Then you get to do it with a condom.

616
00:40:05,364 --> 00:40:07,491
The good news is,
you split the check.

617
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:11,078
I don't think I could
let a woman pay for dinner.

618
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:13,539
Great. They'll throw
a parade in your honor.

619
00:40:13,622 --> 00:40:18,126
<i>You'll be man of the year
in Seattle magazine.</i>

620
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,045
Tiramisu.

621
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:23,006
-What is tiramisu?
-You'll find out.

622
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,758
-What is it?
-You'll see.

623
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:27,719
Some woman will want me to do it to her.
I'm not going to know what it is.

624
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:29,221
You'll love it.

625
00:40:30,222 --> 00:40:32,850
This is going to be tough.
Tough, tough.

626
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:35,018
This is going to be much tougher
than I thought it was going to be.

627
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,438
How about that decorator
on the Bennett job?

628
00:40:38,522 --> 00:40:41,942
-Victoria?
-Yeah, she's perk.

629
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:44,153
-No, I don't...
-Come on!

630
00:40:44,236 --> 00:40:45,863
I'm far away from that.

631
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:48,282
-I'm just assembling notes.
-Notes.

632
00:40:48,365 --> 00:40:51,034
-How would I do that?
-What do you mean? Call her up.

633
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:53,162
You say, "Let's get together.
We'll look at swatches."

634
00:40:53,245 --> 00:40:56,039
Call her on the phone?
Say, "Let's look at swatches"?

635
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:58,917
-Color schemes.
-She's not gonna see through that?

636
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:01,920
You don't do it like I do it.
You do it in your own suave way.

637
00:41:02,004 --> 00:41:04,673
Think Cary Grant.

638
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:08,886
Cary Grant would say,
"Come look at my swatches"?

639
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:12,306
Maybe he did. I know
he didn't do it in the movies.

640
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:13,932
<i>Gunga Din?</i>

641
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:16,310
<i>Gunga Din is not
a swatch kind of movie.</i>

642
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:18,854
Who knows what
he did in real life?

643
00:41:18,937 --> 00:41:21,815
But he did that
with Dyan Cannon?

644
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:24,401
"Hello, Dyan.
Take a look at these swatches."

645
00:41:43,128 --> 00:41:45,547
Jonah, I'm home.

646
00:41:48,509 --> 00:41:49,927
Hey, Jonah!

647
00:42:08,946 --> 00:42:10,447
Hi, Dad. This is Jessica.

648
00:42:13,075 --> 00:42:15,619
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Jessica.

649
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:19,748
<i>Dad, this is amazing. If you play this
backwards, it says, "Paul is dead.''</i>

650
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:23,168
Yeah, I know.

651
00:42:23,252 --> 00:42:25,003
How do you know?

652
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:29,883
Dad, could you shut the door?

653
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:32,135
Sure. Sure.

654
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:33,887
H and G.

655
00:42:35,472 --> 00:42:38,016
Hi and good-bye.

656
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:27,483
<i>I'm back in the saddle again</i>

657

<i>Where you sleep out every night</i>

663
00:43:50,756 --> 00:43:54,051
Hello, Victoria?

664
00:43:54,092 --> 00:43:58,180
This is Sam Baldwin.
I don't know if you remember me, but...

665
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:02,100
Oh, great. Hi.

666
00:44:02,184 --> 00:44:06,230
I was wondering if...

667
00:44:06,313 --> 00:44:10,442
if you would like
to have a drink with me?

668
00:44:10,526 --> 00:44:11,944
Dinner?

669
00:44:13,654 --> 00:44:16,949
Dinner would be even better.

670
00:44:17,032 --> 00:44:20,536
Friday would be great.
Yeah. How...

671
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:23,080
I hear that's a good place.

672
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:30,337
How... 7:30 would be fine.
And Ill...

673
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:35,509
Okay, I'll meet you there. Okay.

674
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:39,221
So it's Friday...

675
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:41,598
at 7:30 for dinner.

676
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,100
Great.

677
00:44:44,643 --> 00:44:46,228
Me too. Bye.

678
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:51,275
<i>Back in the saddle again</i>

679
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:55,612
<i>Are you in love with him?</i>

680
00:44:58,157 --> 00:44:59,992
<i>I'm not now.</i>

681
00:45:00,826 --> 00:45:04,955
Now those were the days
when people knew how to be in love.

682
00:45:04,997 --> 00:45:07,124
-You're a basket case.
-They knew it.

683
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:12,462
Time, distance, nothing could separate
them, because they knew it was right.

684
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:15,591
-It was real. It was...
-A movie.

685
00:45:15,674 --> 00:45:17,593
That's your problem.
You don't want to be in love.

686
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:19,803
You want to be
in love in a movie.

687
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:21,471
Read it to me.

688
00:45:23,265 --> 00:45:27,311
Dear Sleepless and Son, I have never
written a letter like this in my life."

689
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:30,898
That's what everyone writes at
the beginning of letters to strangers.

690
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:34,276
I know that.
You think I don't know that?

691
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:37,112
What about Walter?

692
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:41,158
Walter. Oh, I would
give anything to marry Walter.

693
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:43,368
He's so unexpected.

694
00:45:43,452 --> 00:45:48,457
You think you can tell what he's like
by just looking at him, but you can't.

695
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:51,001
I should write something
in this about magic.

696
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:52,711
-What?
-Something.

697
00:45:52,794 --> 00:45:56,507
What if I never meet him? What if this
man is my destiny and I never meet him?

698
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:59,510
Your destiny can be your doom.
Look at me and Rick.

699
00:45:59,593 --> 00:46:01,553

I can squeeze it in.

704

I'll be in New York with Walter.

705
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:26,703
Do you want to
hear about destiny?

have had the house with the dead tree.</i>

707
00:46:30,749 --> 00:46:33,210
On account of which,
I got divorced.

708
00:46:33,252 --> 00:46:37,047
On account of which, I hit a car
and met Rick while buying a neck brace.

709
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:41,385
Wait. You never told me you got
a divorce because of a dead tree.

710
00:46:42,302 --> 00:46:43,720
The tree man.

711
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:45,848
You fell in love
with the tree man?

712
00:46:45,931 --> 00:46:48,725
I did not say "love."
Did I say love"?

713
00:46:48,809 --> 00:46:51,228
This is my favorite part.

714
00:46:53,272 --> 00:46:55,190
<i>It's now or never.</i>

715
00:46:56,108 --> 00:46:58,402
<i>"Never" is a frightening word.</i>

716

<i>We've already missed the spring.</i>

719
00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:19,298
Men never get this movie.

720
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:20,966
I know.

721
00:47:23,093 --> 00:47:25,429
Mommy! Mommy!

722
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:30,893
It's okay. I'm here.

723
00:47:30,976 --> 00:47:33,353
-Dad!
-I'm comin'.

724
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:35,522
It's all right. It's okay.

725
00:47:36,982 --> 00:47:40,903
It's all right. It's okay.
What was that about?

726
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:43,238
-It was sinking.
-What was?

727
00:47:43,322 --> 00:47:46,617
Our house. There was water
coming in all the windows.

728
00:47:48,285 --> 00:47:50,537
Well, it's okay now.

729
00:47:51,622 --> 00:47:55,292
It's all right.
So what should we do?

730
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:57,794
Your mother used to...

731
00:47:57,878 --> 00:48:00,297
sing to you
when you had bad dreams.

732
00:48:01,465 --> 00:48:03,133
"Bye-Bye, Blackbird."

733
00:48:06,178 --> 00:48:08,847
I miss her.

-I don't know.
-Like, do you believe in heaven?

736
00:48:20,526 --> 00:48:23,153
I never did.

737
00:48:23,237 --> 00:48:26,657
Or the whole idea of an afterlife,
but now I don't know.

738
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:30,452
'Cause I have
these dreams about...

about your mom.

740
00:48:35,457 --> 00:48:39,586

how you're doin'.

742

Which she sort of knows,
but I tell her anyway.

743
00:48:47,094 --> 00:48:49,346
So what is that?

744
00:48:51,473 --> 00:48:53,684
It's sort of an afterlife,
isn't it?

745
00:48:54,726 --> 00:48:56,478
I'm starting to forget her.

746
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:16,248
She could peel an apple...

747
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:20,085
in one long...

748
00:49:20,169 --> 00:49:22,087
curly strip.

749
00:49:23,881 --> 00:49:26,049
The whole apple.

750
00:49:26,091 --> 00:49:28,927

<i>I say bye-bye</i>

See you tomorrow.

757
00:49:53,368 --> 00:49:58,040
<i>Sugar's sweet
So is she</i>

758
00:49:58,123 --> 00:50:00,584
<i>I say bye</i>

759
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:02,961
<i>Bye</i>

760
00:50:03,045 --> 00:50:04,963
<i>Blackbird</i>

761
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:15,474
<i>No one seems to love</i>

762
00:50:15,557 --> 00:50:19,520
<i>Or understand me now</i>

763
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:26,193
<i>Oh, and hard luck stories</i>

764
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:30,823
<i>They keep handin' me, yeah</i>

765
00:50:34,785 --> 00:50:38,413
<i>Where somebody shines a light</i>

<i>Somebody love me now</i>

771
00:51:05,691 --> 00:51:08,944
Laurie?
Hi, it's Annie.

772
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:11,071
Fine. I'm fine.

773
00:51:11,155 --> 00:51:14,825
Listen. I'm doing an article
on call-in radio shows.

774
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:18,579
Do you know anyone who works for
someone named Dr. Marcia Fieldstone?

775
00:51:18,662 --> 00:51:21,832
<i>I'm a writer for the Baltimore Sun
and a friend of Laurie Johnson's.</i>

776
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:24,626
I'm doing a piece on how
people handle bereavement...

777
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:28,755
and I understand you had a caller
the other night, some guy from Seattle.

778
00:51:37,055 --> 00:51:40,225
<i>This is Jonah Baldwin. We're not in
right now, but you can leave...</i>

779
00:52:44,665 --> 00:52:46,083
Architect.

780
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:23,954
Okay, Clarise, I'm gonna be back
either by midnight...

781
00:53:24,037 --> 00:53:26,582
or 8:30, if disaster strikes.

782
00:53:26,665 --> 00:53:28,709
Here's one for both of us.

783
00:53:28,792 --> 00:53:31,461
-"Sleepless and Son, Baltimore."
-I left the restaurant's phone number.

784
00:53:31,545 --> 00:53:34,965
If there's a problem, the pediatrician's
number is right above the phone.

785
00:53:35,048 --> 00:53:39,636
Here's a bottle of ipecac if anybody
drinks poison. By the juice glasses.

786
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,763
-Fine.
-How do I look?

787
00:53:41,805 --> 00:53:44,141
-Great.
-Do I look okay?

788
00:53:44,183 --> 00:53:48,312
Do I look all right? I look stupid.
I look like I'm tryin' too hard.

789
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:50,981
I was gonna get a haircut,
but then I'd look like I got one.

790
00:53:51,064 --> 00:53:54,276
-This is a good letter, Dad.
-The heels on these shoes are grotesque.

791
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:55,903
Looks like
I'm tryin' to be tall.

792
00:53:55,986 --> 00:53:59,072
Her name is Annie.
Annie Reed.

793
00:53:59,156 --> 00:54:00,616
-Bye.
-Read this!

794
00:54:00,657 --> 00:54:02,284
Read this!

795
00:54:04,495 --> 00:54:08,165
"Dear Sleepless and Son,
I've never written..." Blah, blah.

796
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:10,834
"I've been an excellent third baseman
for as long as I remember...

797
00:54:10,918 --> 00:54:13,295
and while we're on the subject,
let's just say that...

798
00:54:13,378 --> 00:54:15,839
Brooks Robinson
was the best third baseman ever.

799
00:54:15,881 --> 00:54:18,342
It's important you agree with me,
because I'm from Baltimore."

800
00:54:18,383 --> 00:54:20,886
She thinks Brooks Robinson's
the greatest. So do you.

801
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:23,764
-Everyone thinks he's the greatest.
-It's a sign.

802
00:54:23,847 --> 00:54:25,307
Come here.

803
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,602
I'll show you a sign.
Here's a sign.

804
00:54:28,685 --> 00:54:31,230
All right.

805
00:54:31,313 --> 00:54:33,357
Where is Seattle?
Right.

806
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,692
Where is Baltimore?

807
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:37,820
It's right there! Look!

808
00:54:37,903 --> 00:54:41,532
One, two, three, four... There's like
26 states between here and there.

809
00:54:41,573 --> 00:54:43,033
Now that's a sign.

810
00:54:43,116 --> 00:54:45,744
I'm outta here.
Good-bye. Good night.

811
00:54:45,828 --> 00:54:47,412
I love you.

812
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:53,460
Clarise, did you move your car?

813
00:55:03,637 --> 00:55:05,889
-Thank you, Derrick.
-You're welcome.

814
00:55:05,973 --> 00:55:07,474
-I'll have...
-White wine?

815
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:10,769
-And you, sir?
-I'm fine, thank you.

816
00:55:11,937 --> 00:55:15,732
-You look good.
-You look good yourself.

817
00:55:20,279 --> 00:55:23,323
-I thought you were never gonna call me.
-You did?

818
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:26,577
But I really wanted you to,
and I thought you were never going to.

819
00:55:26,618 --> 00:55:28,579
-Excuse me, Mr. Baldwin?
-Yes?

820
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,581
There's a phone call for you.

821
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:39,256
Thank you.
Hello?

822
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:42,593
<i>Dad, can we go to New York City
for Valentine's Day?</i>

823
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:44,928
What?

824
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:47,139
<i>Annie Reed from Baltimore
wants to meet us....</i>

825
00:55:47,222 --> 00:55:51,560
<i>at the top of the Empire State Building
on Valentine's Day.</i>

826
00:55:51,643 --> 00:55:53,562
<i>-Jonah.
-What?</i>

827
00:55:53,645 --> 00:55:56,231
Have you fallen down?
Are you bleeding?

828
00:55:56,315 --> 00:55:59,276
Is Clarise there?
Has she been strangled?

829
00:55:59,318 --> 00:56:01,320
So this is the only reason
for this phone call?

830
00:56:01,403 --> 00:56:04,156
<i>If we book now,
we can get an excursion fare.</i>

831
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:06,825
<i>Jessica's parents are travel agents,
and Jessica says...</i>

832
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:08,911
I'm not going to have
this conversation now.

833
00:56:08,952 --> 00:56:11,246
We will talk about it
at a later time.

834
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:14,625
I can't believe this conversation
has lasted this long. You go to bed.

835
00:56:22,174 --> 00:56:23,634
Everything all right?

836
00:56:23,675 --> 00:56:25,761
Oh, yeah.
Do you have kids?

837
00:56:25,802 --> 00:56:27,304
-No.
-Want mine?

838
00:56:30,974 --> 00:56:33,227
I will have an Absolut
straight up, please.

839
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:34,895
Sure.

840
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:55,499
Put that down! Stop it!

841
00:56:55,582 --> 00:56:58,293
There she is.

842
00:56:58,377 --> 00:57:02,172
-Why is she bringing those groceries?
-She's cooking for us, so be prepared.

843
00:57:02,214 --> 00:57:05,133
Hi, Sam. Thanks.
Thanks.

844
00:57:05,175 --> 00:57:07,928
And let me guess.
You must be Jonah.

845
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:13,350
-This it?
-Yeah.

846
00:57:13,392 --> 00:57:15,686
-The car's down this way.
-Great.

847
00:57:17,229 --> 00:57:19,273
<i>She's on her sixth painter...</i>

848
00:57:19,356 --> 00:57:21,275
and we're never
gonna finish this job.

849
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:23,360
Now she wants
the fireplace re-bricked.

850
00:57:23,443 --> 00:57:25,737
I know her pretty well.
I could give her a call.

851
00:57:25,821 --> 00:57:29,533
I've got it solved. I'm just gonna hit
her with one of those fireplace bricks.

852
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:35,956
Oh, that is so funny.
You are so funny.

853
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:38,917
Whenever she wants anything done,
she does this song and dance about...

854
00:57:39,001 --> 00:57:41,253
"I don't know. I'm stupid.
You tell me.

855
00:57:41,336 --> 00:57:44,339
<i>You know better than I,
but couldn't we flip the house...</i>

856
00:57:44,423 --> 00:57:48,051
so everything on one side is now on the
other, and the back becomes the front?

857
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:50,179
Could the whole house
open up on a hinge?

858
00:57:50,262 --> 00:57:53,724
That way I could just get in
with the garage door opener."

859
00:57:53,807 --> 00:57:57,394
<i>I just say, "Yeah, we can do that.
We're just gonna have to... ''</i>

860
00:57:57,478 --> 00:58:00,397
Move the kitchen cabinets."

861
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:09,239
Jonah, bring that stuff.

862
00:58:11,283 --> 00:58:12,743
Do you like baseball?

863
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:16,121
Yes, I do.

864
00:58:16,205 --> 00:58:19,666
<i>My firm has box seats to the Mariners.
Why don't we all go sometime?</i>

865
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:24,296
-What about camping?
-What about it?

866
00:58:24,379 --> 00:58:27,799
-Do you like camping?
-I went camping once.

867
00:58:28,967 --> 00:58:31,595
You know what?
We oughta start camping more often.

868
00:58:31,678 --> 00:58:35,057
You're right. Camping is good.
Time for bed.

869
00:58:35,098 --> 00:58:37,434
-It's only 10:00.
-Yeah, 10:00.

870
00:58:37,518 --> 00:58:39,603
Time for bed.

871
00:58:39,686 --> 00:58:41,355
Good night.

872
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:48,570
Don't you wanna thank Victoria
for this delicious dinner?

873
00:58:48,654 --> 00:58:52,491
Thanks for dinner. I never saw
anybody cook potatoes that way.

874
00:58:53,951 --> 00:58:56,245
I'm glad you liked it.

875
00:58:56,286 --> 00:58:58,247
Good night, Jonah.

876
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:03,794
Yeah, we don't see
a lot of potatoes around here.

877
00:59:03,877 --> 00:59:05,796
We're rice men.

878
01:00:00,851 --> 01:00:03,520
I'm sorry, Walter.
I'm sorry.

879
01:00:07,733 --> 01:00:10,027
<i>-Hello?
-Turn on your radio.</i>

880
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:12,029
<i>-What?
-The kid is on.</i>

881
01:00:12,112 --> 01:00:14,698
<i>You've got me
listening to this garbage.</i>

882
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:17,201
Who is it?

883
01:00:17,242 --> 01:00:21,413
It's Becky. She's...
She's having trouble with Rick again.

884
01:00:21,497 --> 01:00:24,416
I'll go downstairs, Becky.
I'll call you back.

885
01:00:27,211 --> 01:00:29,880
I'm sorry, Walter.
Are you bleeding?

886
01:00:50,859 --> 01:00:54,029
<i>-He's kissing her right this minute!
-Oh, really?</i>

887
01:00:54,071 --> 01:00:57,825
<i>Jonah, tell the truth.
Are you spying on your father?</i>

888
01:00:57,908 --> 01:01:01,036
<i>-Who's he kissing right this minute?
-Listen to this.</i>

889
01:01:01,078 --> 01:01:03,038
<i>I have to make them stop.</i>

890
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,708
<i>-How am I gonna explain this to Walter?
-She came over and cooked dinner.</i>

891
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:09,878
<i>She brought two bags of groceries,
like she was staying for a year.</i>

892
01:01:09,962 --> 01:01:12,923
<i>Jonah, it's good
that your father's dating.</i>

893
01:01:12,965 --> 01:01:16,260
<i>It's just hard on you.
It's something you think you want.</i>

894
01:01:16,301 --> 01:01:20,097
<i>-Then when it happens, it scares you.
-That's not true.</i>

895
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:23,142
<i>Think. Shouldn't your father
be the judge....</i>

896
01:01:23,225 --> 01:01:26,145
<i>of whether someone is right
or wrong for him?</i>

897
01:01:26,228 --> 01:01:28,230
<i>He's not sane enough
to judge anything.</i>

898
01:01:28,272 --> 01:01:31,066
Now he's kissing her on the lips.
She's a 'ho!

899
01:01:31,108 --> 01:01:34,236
My dad's been captured by a 'ho!
What am I going to do?

900
01:01:34,278 --> 01:01:36,280
<i>Calm down, Jonah.</i>

901
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:39,074
<i>Tomorrow morning when you're
having breakfast with your dad....</i>

902
01:01:39,116 --> 01:01:41,451
<i>tell him how you feel.</i>

903
01:01:41,535 --> 01:01:45,080
<i>It's not good to keep
your feelings inside you.</i>

904
01:01:49,334 --> 01:01:53,046
Miss Scarlet. In the broom closet.
With the radio.

905
01:01:56,258 --> 01:01:59,178
You scared me.
Don't ever do that again.

906
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:05,809
-I thought I saw a black widow.
-You scared me to death!

907
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:09,188
-You scared Victoria to death.
-It was right over there.

908
01:02:09,271 --> 01:02:12,983
The next time you think you see a
black widow spider, I want you to say...

909
01:02:13,025 --> 01:02:16,945
"Dad, excuse me, but I believe
a poisonous insect is in the house''...

910
01:02:17,029 --> 01:02:19,198
and I will calmly come
and take care of it.

911
01:02:19,281 --> 01:02:20,824
Scream again, I'll kill you.

912
01:02:20,908 --> 01:02:25,454
Becky heard this guy on the radio she
was sure was Rick. She was hysterical.

913
01:02:25,496 --> 01:02:29,708
And then it turned out
the guy lived in Duluth.

914
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:32,711
-Where is Duluth?
-That doesn't make any sense.

915
01:02:32,794 --> 01:02:36,298
I know, Walter.
It doesn't make any sense at all.

916
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:38,967
Thank God my life is in place.

917
01:02:39,051 --> 01:02:41,970
Duluth? That's in North Dakota.

918
01:02:55,943 --> 01:02:59,947
I love this letter.
You have to write to her.

919
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:03,158
-You think so?
-It's Y.O.H.

920
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,410
Yeah. What's that?

921
01:03:05,494 --> 01:03:07,120
Your only hope.

922
01:03:19,174 --> 01:03:22,386
I thought I would look into
doing a story on those radio shows.

923
01:03:23,846 --> 01:03:26,181
You'd probably have to go somewhere
to really look into it.

924
01:03:26,807 --> 01:03:28,976
Definitely.

925
01:03:47,661 --> 01:03:49,788
Couldn't you do
a phone interview?

926
01:03:49,872 --> 01:03:54,459
Not for the kind of piece I wanna do.
I won't be in Chicago that long.

927
01:03:54,543 --> 01:03:56,628
When you get back, I'll be gone.

928
01:03:56,712 --> 01:03:59,173
And then I'll see you in New York.

929
01:03:59,256 --> 01:04:01,049
I'll get it.

930
01:04:05,012 --> 01:04:06,430
<i>This is Captain Browning.</i>

931
01:04:06,513 --> 01:04:10,100
<i>We're at our cruising altitude
of approximately 35,000 feet.</i>

932
01:04:10,184 --> 01:04:14,980
<i>The weather is clear to the west, and we
expect to arrive in Seattle on schedule.</i>

933
01:04:16,064 --> 01:04:18,942
-Don't you hate flying?
-Yes, I do.

934
01:04:19,026 --> 01:04:23,947
And I just told the most terrible one
to the man I'm about to marry.

935
01:04:23,989 --> 01:04:26,783
Do you feel that
any lie is a betrayal?

936
01:04:27,784 --> 01:04:29,786
I said "flying."

937
01:04:37,753 --> 01:04:39,671
Thanks for bringing me out here.

938
01:04:39,755 --> 01:04:42,174
Well, he likes the planes.

939
01:04:42,257 --> 01:04:46,637
Can I bring something back for you?
A souvenir? Does he like snow globes?

940
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,181
You shake them up
and then the snow floats down.

941
01:04:49,264 --> 01:04:52,976
Sure. I'd really like that.
Thank you so much.

942
01:04:57,147 --> 01:04:59,274
-He's eight.
-He's good at it.

943
01:04:59,316 --> 01:05:01,276
I read an article about this.

944
01:05:01,318 --> 01:05:04,446
All children are hideous at age eight.
It's quite normal.

945
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:06,782
Well, maybe when I come back...

946
01:05:06,824 --> 01:05:10,202
the two of us oughta spend
some time together on our own.

947
01:05:10,285 --> 01:05:12,329
What do you think?

948
01:05:15,582 --> 01:05:17,501
Bye.

949
01:05:17,584 --> 01:05:19,253
Bye, Jonah.

950
01:05:26,677 --> 01:05:30,264
Listen to me.
You don't know Victoria.

951
01:05:30,347 --> 01:05:32,266
I hardly know her myself.

952
01:05:32,349 --> 01:05:35,269
She is, in fact,
a mystery to me.

953
01:05:35,352 --> 01:05:38,689
She tosses her hair a lot.
Why does she do this?

954
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:41,608
I have no idea. Is it a twitch?
Does she need a haircut?

955
01:05:41,692 --> 01:05:45,195
Should she use a barrette
to keep her hair out of her face?

956
01:05:46,697 --> 01:05:49,867
These are things I'm willing
to get to the bottom of.

957
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:53,328
And that is why I am dating her.

958
01:05:54,538 --> 01:05:56,665
That's all I'm doing.

959
01:05:56,707 --> 01:05:59,042
<i>I'm not living with her.
I'm not marrying her.</i>

960
01:05:59,084 --> 01:06:01,879
Can you appreciate
the difference?

961
01:06:03,338 --> 01:06:04,840
This is what single people do.

962
01:06:04,882 --> 01:06:07,718
They try other people on
and see how they fit.

963
01:06:07,801 --> 01:06:10,554
But everybody's an adjustment.
Nobody's perfect.

964
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:14,099
There's no such thing
as a perfect...

965
01:06:30,282 --> 01:06:31,867
Come on.

966
01:06:34,369 --> 01:06:37,581
Dad, I was talking to Jessica
about reincarnation.

967
01:06:37,623 --> 01:06:39,708
She says you knew Annie
in another life.

968
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:42,377
-Who's Annie?
-The one who wrote us.

969
01:06:42,419 --> 01:06:45,964
But Jessica says you and Annie
never got together in that life.

970
01:06:46,048 --> 01:06:48,717
So your hearts are like puzzles
with missing pieces.

971
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:50,969
And when you get together,
the puzzle's complete.

972
01:06:51,053 --> 01:06:52,554
Goddamn it.

973
01:06:52,638 --> 01:06:55,724
The reason I know this and you don't
is because I'm younger and purer...

974
01:06:55,766 --> 01:06:58,894
so I'm more in touch
with cosmic forces.

975
01:06:58,977 --> 01:07:01,814
-Who told you this stuff?
-Jessica.

976
01:07:01,897 --> 01:07:04,775
I sincerely hope
you're not marrying Jessica.

977
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:15,702
<i>I remember the days
of just keepin' time</i>

978
01:07:15,786 --> 01:07:20,082
<i>Of hangin' around
in sleepy towns</i>

979
01:07:20,123 --> 01:07:22,292
<i>Forever</i>

980
01:07:22,376 --> 01:07:26,255
<i>Back roads empty for miles</i>

981
01:07:28,173 --> 01:07:32,636
<i>Well, you can't have a dream
and cut it to fit</i>

982
01:07:32,678 --> 01:07:36,515
<i>But when I saw you
I knew</i>

983
01:07:36,598 --> 01:07:39,059
<i>We'd go together</i>

984
01:07:39,143 --> 01:07:42,479
<i>Like a wink and a smile</i>

985
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:50,112
<i>Leave your old jalopy</i>

986
01:07:50,154 --> 01:07:54,324
<i>By the railroad track</i>

987
01:07:54,408 --> 01:07:58,620
<i>We'll get a hip
double-dip, tip-toppy</i>

988
01:07:58,662 --> 01:08:01,790
<i>Two-seat Pontiac</i>

989
01:08:04,168 --> 01:08:07,296
<i>So you can rev her up</i>

990
01:08:07,379 --> 01:08:09,339
<i>Don't go slow</i>

991
01:08:09,381 --> 01:08:12,843
<i>It's only green lights
and all rights</i>

992
01:08:12,926 --> 01:08:16,096
<i>Let's go together</i>

993
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:18,974
<i>With a wink and a smile</i>

994
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:36,241
<i>Give me a wink and a smile</i>

995
01:08:48,212 --> 01:08:50,130
<i>We go together</i>

996
01:08:50,214 --> 01:08:52,966
<i>Like a wink and a smile</i>

997
01:08:56,887 --> 01:09:00,474
<i>Now my heart hears music</i>

998
01:09:00,557 --> 01:09:03,310
<i>Such a simple song</i>

999
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:08,857
<i>Sing it again
The notes never end</i>

1000
01:09:08,899 --> 01:09:12,361
<i>This is where I belong</i>

1001
01:09:13,654 --> 01:09:17,241
<i>Just the sound of your voice
The light in your eyes</i>

1002
01:09:17,324 --> 01:09:21,912
<i>We're so far away
from yesterday</i>

1003
01:09:21,995 --> 01:09:24,540
<i>Together</i>

1004
01:09:24,623 --> 01:09:27,835
<i>With a wink and a smile</i>

1005
01:09:30,754 --> 01:09:34,424
<i>We go together</i>

1006
01:09:34,508 --> 01:09:38,428
<i>Like a wink and a smile</i>

1007
01:09:48,438 --> 01:09:52,192
<i>-I watched him play with his son.
-Did you talk to him?</i>

1008
01:09:53,277 --> 01:09:55,195
<i>I couldn't do it.</i>

1009
01:09:57,281 --> 01:10:00,742
<i>-How did I get here?
-You told a lie and got on a plane.</i>

1010
01:10:00,784 --> 01:10:02,786
That's not what I mean.

1011
01:10:04,204 --> 01:10:08,125
I'm going back over there tomorrow
and talk to him. I am.

1012
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:11,253
<i>Okay. Good.
Good-bye.</i>

1013
01:10:11,336 --> 01:10:13,297
<i>-Beck?
-What?</i>

1014
01:10:15,757 --> 01:10:18,093
<i>-Is this crazy?
-No.</i>

1015
01:10:18,135 --> 01:10:20,512
<i>That's the weirdest part about it.</i>

1016
01:10:21,597 --> 01:10:24,308
Thank you.
I love you.

1017
01:10:24,391 --> 01:10:27,019
<i>-I love you too.
-Good night.</i>

1018
01:11:29,623 --> 01:11:33,043
Oh, it's so good to see you.
Where's Greg?

1019
01:11:57,317 --> 01:11:58,235
Hello.

1020
01:12:07,578 --> 01:12:11,748
<i>-So then what happened?
-So then I left, obviously.</i>

1021
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,543
You were standing
in the middle of the street?

1022
01:12:14,585 --> 01:12:18,422
You know that dream when you're on the
street naked and everyone is looking?

1023
01:12:18,463 --> 01:12:20,174
I love that dream.

1024
01:12:20,257 --> 01:12:23,886
That was nothing compared
to this humiliation. Nothing.

1025
01:12:23,927 --> 01:12:26,013
-But he saw you, right?
-He saw me.

1026
01:12:26,096 --> 01:12:29,558
-You were face-to-face?
-He said hello.

1027
01:12:29,641 --> 01:12:33,103
-He said hello, and what did you say?
-All I could say was hello.

1028
01:12:34,146 --> 01:12:36,023
Oh, my God!

1029
01:12:36,106 --> 01:12:39,943
<i>And all I could say was hello.</i>

1030
01:12:40,027 --> 01:12:42,070
It's a sign.

1031
01:12:42,154 --> 01:12:46,366
It's a sign that I have watched
this movie too many times.

1032
01:12:47,451 --> 01:12:49,077
So stupid.

1033
01:12:49,161 --> 01:12:54,082
Since I listened to that stupid program
on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.

1034
01:12:54,124 --> 01:12:56,835
-You are not a jerk.
-Thank you.

1035
01:12:56,919 --> 01:13:00,088
-Idiot.
-You don't know who she was.

1036
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:04,092
I saw her. I have a picture of her.
I'll show you a picture of her.

1037
01:13:04,134 --> 01:13:07,012
That detective in Seattle
sent me a picture of her.

1038
01:13:07,095 --> 01:13:09,014
Here. See?

1039
01:13:09,097 --> 01:13:11,475
That's exactly
what she looks like.

1040
01:13:11,517 --> 01:13:13,727
This is a picture
of someone's back.

1041
01:13:13,811 --> 01:13:17,064
Well, it's her
and he was crazy about her.

1042
01:13:17,147 --> 01:13:20,526
What's this?
This is from Seattle.

1043
01:13:32,496 --> 01:13:34,414
So I mailed your letter.

1044
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:39,628
"Dear Annie,
thanks for your letter.

1045
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:42,840
It was great.
You sound neat.

1046
01:13:46,176 --> 01:13:49,888
We're very excited about meeting you
in New York on Valentine's Day...

1047
01:13:49,972 --> 01:13:52,808
and seeing if we are...

1048
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:55,435
M.F.E.O.

1049
01:13:55,519 --> 01:13:56,937
See you soon.

1050
01:13:57,688 --> 01:14:00,524
Sleepless in Seattle."

1051
01:14:00,566 --> 01:14:01,859
M.F. E. O?

1052
01:14:06,363 --> 01:14:09,032
Made for each other.

1053
01:14:09,992 --> 01:14:13,287
<i>It's cute.
It's like a little clue.</i>

1054
01:14:17,875 --> 01:14:21,170
So he can't write. Big deal.

1055
01:14:21,211 --> 01:14:24,047
Verbal ability is a highly
overrated thing in a guy...

1056
01:14:24,131 --> 01:14:27,050
and our pathetic need for it
is what gets us into trouble.

1057
01:14:27,092 --> 01:14:31,013
I will be running back to Walter's arms,
if he'll still have me.

1058
01:14:31,054 --> 01:14:33,140
-What about the letter?
-It means nothing.

1059
01:14:33,223 --> 01:14:36,435
It was written before
I went out there, before the 'ho.

1060
01:14:39,897 --> 01:14:43,358
The only thing is,
she didn't look like a 'ho.

1061
01:14:43,442 --> 01:14:46,320
She looked like somebody
we would've been friends with.

1062
01:14:50,949 --> 01:14:53,869
-You saw her in the airport, then here?
-I tried to talk to her.

1063
01:14:53,911 --> 01:14:56,330
It was like I knew her.
It was weird.

1064
01:14:56,413 --> 01:14:57,831
Like a deja vu thing?

1065
01:14:57,915 --> 01:15:02,085
<i>It was a very French
deja vu-ish kind of thing. Oui.</i>

1066
01:15:02,127 --> 01:15:05,672
At least you're out there
seeing people again. That's terrific.

1067
01:15:05,756 --> 01:15:07,716
<i>Well, there's really just the one.</i>

1068
01:15:08,258 --> 01:15:10,677
Victoria.

1069
01:15:10,761 --> 01:15:13,597
-You don't like Victoria?
-She laughs like a hyena.

1070
01:15:14,306 --> 01:15:16,266
Is this true?

1071
01:15:17,559 --> 01:15:20,604
Sort of, a little bit.
Tell them what you did.

1072
01:15:21,897 --> 01:15:24,358
Tell 'em about the radio show.
They wanna hear it.

1073
01:15:24,441 --> 01:15:29,279
Tell 'em. Christmas Eve, he phones in
one of those radio call-in shows.

1074
01:15:29,321 --> 01:15:32,282
Tells them I need a new wife.

1075
01:15:32,366 --> 01:15:34,117
Oh, you're kidding.

1076
01:15:34,201 --> 01:15:36,203
That's so sweet.

1077
01:15:36,286 --> 01:15:40,249
-He's obsessed with a lady who wrote me.
-You serious?

1078
01:15:40,332 --> 01:15:43,293
She wants to meet me at the top
of the Empire State Building.

1079
01:15:43,377 --> 01:15:45,879
On Valentine's Day.

1080
01:15:45,963 --> 01:15:48,632
-It's like that movie.
-What movie?

1081
01:15:48,715 --> 01:15:51,635
<i>An Affair To Remember.
Did you ever see it?</i>

1082
01:15:51,677 --> 01:15:53,679
Oh, God.

1083
01:15:53,762 --> 01:15:56,974
Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.
Is it "car" or "cur"?

1084
01:15:57,057 --> 01:15:58,600
-Cur.
-Car.

1085
01:16:00,561 --> 01:16:03,313
She's gonna meet him at the top
of the Empire State Building...

1086
01:16:03,355 --> 01:16:05,941
only she got hit by a taxi.

1087
01:16:05,983 --> 01:16:07,943
And he waited and waited.

1088
01:16:07,985 --> 01:16:10,988
And it was raining, I think.

1089
01:16:11,071 --> 01:16:12,156
And then...

1090
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:15,492
she's too proud to tell him...

1091
01:16:15,576 --> 01:16:17,744
that she's, uh...

1092
01:16:20,164 --> 01:16:22,166
crippled.

1093
01:16:22,249 --> 01:16:26,086
And he's too proud to find out
why she doesn't come.

1094
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:28,130
But he comes to see her anyway.

1095
01:16:28,172 --> 01:16:30,507
I forget why, but, oh...

1096
01:16:30,549 --> 01:16:34,845
Oh, it's so amazing
when he comes to see her because...

1097
01:16:34,928 --> 01:16:39,016
he doesn't even notice that
she doesn't get up to say hello.

1098
01:16:39,099 --> 01:16:41,602
And he's very bitter.

1099
01:16:42,978 --> 01:16:47,357
And you think that he's just gonna
walk out the door...

1100
01:16:47,441 --> 01:16:52,154
and never know why she's just
lying there, you know, on the couch...

1101
01:16:52,196 --> 01:16:56,658
with this blanket
over her shriveled little legs.

1102
01:16:58,785 --> 01:17:01,872
-Are you all right?
-She's fine.

1103
01:17:01,955 --> 01:17:05,417
Suddenly he goes,
I already sold the painting."

1104
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:08,545
And he like
goes to the bedroom...

1105
01:17:08,629 --> 01:17:12,674
and he looks and he comes out and
he looks at her and he kind of just...

1106
01:17:12,758 --> 01:17:16,345
They know and then they hug.
And it's so...

1107
01:17:17,262 --> 01:17:20,557
-That's a chick's movie.
-I would say so.

1108
01:17:20,641 --> 01:17:24,019
What kind of a person would write
to someone they heard on the radio?

1109
01:17:24,061 --> 01:17:27,189
I got hundreds of letters
from women all over the country.

1110
01:17:27,231 --> 01:17:28,690
Desperate women.

1111
01:17:28,732 --> 01:17:32,069
Just because someone is looking for
a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.

1112
01:17:32,152 --> 01:17:34,530
How about rapacious
and love-starved?

1113
01:17:34,571 --> 01:17:37,699
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist
than to find a husband after the age...

1114
01:17:37,783 --> 01:17:39,910
That is absolutely untrue.

1115
01:17:39,993 --> 01:17:42,246
Right, honey. Right.

1116
01:17:42,287 --> 01:17:44,706
<i>I'm not lookin' for
a mail-order bride.</i>

1117
01:17:44,748 --> 01:17:48,794
I just want somebody that I can have a
decent conversation with over dinner...

1118
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:52,381
without it fallin' down
into weepy tears over some movie.

1119
01:17:52,464 --> 01:17:53,966
She's very emotional.

1120
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:56,176
<i>-But I cried at The Dirty Dozen.
-Who didn't?</i>

1121
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:59,721
Jim Brown is throwin' these
hand grenades down these air shafts...

1122
01:17:59,763 --> 01:18:02,975
and Richard Jaeckel and Lee Marvin
were sittin' on top of this...

1123
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:05,853
armored personnel carrier,
dressed up like Nazis.

1124
01:18:05,936 --> 01:18:09,106
They're waiting.
Trini Lopez...

1125
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:13,819
He busted his neck when they were
parachuting down behind the Nazi lines.

1126
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:15,445
Stop it.

1127
01:18:15,529 --> 01:18:19,575
Richard Jaeckel had on this shiny helmet
'cause he was the M.P.

1128
01:18:19,658 --> 01:18:20,617
No more.

1129
01:18:21,869 --> 01:18:24,621
Oh, God, I love that movie.

1130
01:18:32,462 --> 01:18:35,716
This is the best movie
I've ever seen in my life.

1131
01:18:35,799 --> 01:18:37,509
<i>What's so great about it?</i>

1132
01:18:37,593 --> 01:18:40,179
You have to find her.
You have to go to her.

1133
01:18:40,262 --> 01:18:42,431
Do you know how much money it costs
to go to New York?

1134
01:18:42,473 --> 01:18:44,433
Nobody knows.

1135
01:18:44,475 --> 01:18:48,604
It changes practically every day.
How much money do you have?

1136
01:18:48,687 --> 01:18:50,147
Eighty dollars.

1137
01:18:50,189 --> 01:18:53,609
I have 42. That would
probably cover taxicabs.

1138
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:55,152
How would I get there?

1139
01:18:56,236 --> 01:18:58,739
Honey, I have to run
these tickets over to someone.

1140
01:18:58,822 --> 01:19:00,741
Can you keep an eye on things?

1141
01:19:00,824 --> 01:19:02,910
Sure, Mom.

1142
01:19:13,086 --> 01:19:16,423
-Do you want a window seat or an aisle?
-Window.

1143
01:19:16,507 --> 01:19:18,801
-Do you want a fruit plate?
-I don't know. Do I?

1144
01:19:18,842 --> 01:19:21,595
I'd rather die
than eat airplane food.

1145
01:19:21,678 --> 01:19:23,889
I'm telling them you're 12
so you can fly unaccompanied...

1146
01:19:23,972 --> 01:19:25,974
and the stewardess
won't carry you around.

1147
01:19:26,058 --> 01:19:28,685
Are you crazy?
Who'd believe I'm 12?

1148
01:19:28,769 --> 01:19:31,688
If it's in the computer,
they believe anything.

1149
01:19:31,772 --> 01:19:33,690
Are you sure?

1150
01:19:33,774 --> 01:19:36,193
Do you want me to say that
you're really short for your age...

1151
01:19:36,276 --> 01:19:38,445
and that they shouldn't say anything
'cause it would hurt your feelings?

1152
01:19:38,529 --> 01:19:40,864
Yeah, that's a great idea.

1153
01:19:40,906 --> 01:19:45,786
<i>Sometimes it's hard to be</i>

1154
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:47,830
<i>A woman</i>

1155
01:19:50,707 --> 01:19:53,794
<i>Givin' all your love</i>

1156
01:19:53,877 --> 01:19:58,340
<i>To just one man</i>

1157
01:19:58,423 --> 01:19:59,716
Walter.

1158
01:20:01,051 --> 01:20:04,805
-You're gonna miss the train.
-No, I'm not.

1159
01:20:04,888 --> 01:20:08,517
I'm so happy, Becky.
Finally I feel happy.

1160
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,561
This is right. This is real.

1161
01:20:10,602 --> 01:20:13,355
Everything else is what happens
when you watch too many movies...

1162
01:20:13,397 --> 01:20:15,899
and you completely
lose sight of what counts.

1163
01:20:15,983 --> 01:20:18,235
Please, don't tell anybody
what happened.

1164
01:20:18,318 --> 01:20:20,904
I would be so absolutely mortified
if anyone knew...

1165
01:20:20,988 --> 01:20:24,283
I did anything even
remotely close to what I've done.

1166
01:20:24,366 --> 01:20:27,369
<i>-Thank you. Do you promise?
-I promise.</i>

1167
01:20:27,411 --> 01:20:29,872
Sleepless in Seattle
is history.

1168
01:20:29,913 --> 01:20:34,042
<i>He's hard to understand</i>

1169
01:20:36,253 --> 01:20:40,716
<i>And if you love him</i>

1170
01:20:40,799 --> 01:20:45,345
<i>Oh, be proud of him</i>

1171
01:20:45,429 --> 01:20:48,765
<i>'Cause after all</i>

1172
01:20:48,807 --> 01:20:51,602
<i>He's just a man</i>

1173
01:20:54,813 --> 01:20:57,774
<i>Stand by your man</i>

1174
01:21:00,694 --> 01:21:02,279
I was...

1175
01:21:03,697 --> 01:21:05,657
-Go ahead.
-You go.

1176
01:21:05,741 --> 01:21:08,160
Okay. Well,
I was just gonna say...

1177
01:21:08,243 --> 01:21:11,830
that ever since Christmas,
you've been different...

1178
01:21:11,914 --> 01:21:14,458
kind of distracted, distant.

1179
01:21:14,541 --> 01:21:17,002
But now...

1180
01:21:17,085 --> 01:21:21,757
it feels as if you're coming back
from wherever you were.

1181
01:21:21,798 --> 01:21:23,425
I am.

1182
01:21:25,302 --> 01:21:27,888
I was just, uh...

1183
01:21:27,971 --> 01:21:32,100
I just got...
I think I got nervous.

1184
01:21:32,184 --> 01:21:34,394
But that's normal, right?

1185
01:21:34,478 --> 01:21:38,190
I mean, don't you ever
feel nervous about...

1186
01:21:38,273 --> 01:21:40,234
You know?

1187
01:21:40,317 --> 01:21:42,319
What?

1188
01:21:42,402 --> 01:21:43,654
Forever.

1189
01:21:53,455 --> 01:21:56,708
I did, and you know what I think?

1190
01:21:56,792 --> 01:22:01,004
I think I thought
it was too perfect, you know?

1191
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:04,591
I started to wonder
if we were the human equivalent...

1192
01:22:04,675 --> 01:22:06,802
of two rights making a wrong.

1193
01:22:06,844 --> 01:22:08,804
You know what it was?

1194
01:22:08,846 --> 01:22:12,474
It was like kismet, but not,
if you see what I mean.

1195
01:22:14,017 --> 01:22:15,477
You have to grow up.

1196
01:22:15,519 --> 01:22:18,355
You just can't keep having
all these adolescent fantasies...

1197
01:22:18,397 --> 01:22:20,858
about how exciting
your life is gonna be.

1198
01:22:20,899 --> 01:22:23,569
Don't hate me,
but I love this pattern.

1199
01:22:23,652 --> 01:22:25,654
-You couldn't.
-I do.

1200
01:22:25,737 --> 01:22:28,574
This is just like
my grandmother's china.

1201
01:22:28,657 --> 01:22:31,118
How many place settings
should I put down?

1202
01:22:31,201 --> 01:22:32,786
Ten.

1203
01:22:35,455 --> 01:22:38,333
Exactly. Eight is too few.

1204
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:41,044
Twelve is too many.

1205
01:23:06,570 --> 01:23:08,530
It was my mother's.

1206
01:23:10,491 --> 01:23:12,743
I had them size it down.

1207
01:23:14,161 --> 01:23:16,246
She had really fat fingers.

1208
01:23:18,749 --> 01:23:20,459
It's so beautiful.

1209
01:23:20,542 --> 01:23:23,754
It's exactly what I would
pick out if I had...

1210
01:23:23,795 --> 01:23:26,632
every ring in the whole world
to choose from.

1211
01:23:29,259 --> 01:23:30,761
You see what I mean?

1212
01:23:30,844 --> 01:23:34,389
There are people who would like
a relationship to be full of surprises.

1213
01:23:34,431 --> 01:23:36,809
But I am not one of those people.

1214
01:23:36,892 --> 01:23:39,102
No, sirree.

1215
01:23:39,186 --> 01:23:41,897
Surprises are highly overrated.

1216
01:23:44,775 --> 01:23:47,903
I'm leavin' first thing in the morning,
but I'm only gonna be gone one night.

1217
01:23:47,945 --> 01:23:50,072
Clarise is gonna be here,
so you'll be able to see...

1218
01:23:50,155 --> 01:23:52,491
<i>plenty of Geraldo
and Nightmare On Elm Street 12.</i>

1219
01:23:52,574 --> 01:23:54,868
-I will never know.
-Are you going with her?

1220
01:23:56,787 --> 01:23:58,914
I'm going with Victoria, yes.

1221
01:24:01,124 --> 01:24:03,961
<i>And don't try anything tricky.
Understand?</i>

1222
01:24:07,005 --> 01:24:10,092
Don't go rollin' in poison ivy
as soon as I leave the house...

1223
01:24:10,134 --> 01:24:13,595
or lock yourself in a closet or do
anything that makes you need stitches.

1224
01:24:13,637 --> 01:24:15,764
If your finger falls off,
it's stayin' off.

1225
01:24:15,806 --> 01:24:18,267
No one's gonna pack it on ice
and take you to the hospital...

1226
01:24:18,308 --> 01:24:21,478
so you can be
a breakthrough in laser surgery.

1227
01:24:21,562 --> 01:24:24,606
-Is this about that woman in Baltimore?
-Annie.

1228
01:24:29,153 --> 01:24:31,572
-I don't care what you do!
-Good! Fine!

1229
01:24:31,655 --> 01:24:34,950
I'll tell you what I'm doin'
this weekend. I'm getting laid.

1230
01:24:34,992 --> 01:24:36,994
1990s and nobody is getting laid.

1231
01:24:37,077 --> 01:24:39,746
<i>I'm the only man in America
who is getting laid this weekend.</i>

1232
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:44,168
I haven't been laid that much.
Six girls in college, maybe seven.

1233
01:24:45,419 --> 01:24:48,380
-How long you been standin' there?
-Forever.

1234
01:24:48,463 --> 01:24:52,301
-What did you hear me just say?
-"Six girls in college, maybe seven."

1235
01:24:52,342 --> 01:24:55,095
Seven.
Eight! Mary Kelly.

1236
01:24:55,179 --> 01:24:56,638
This is the one I like.

1237
01:24:59,516 --> 01:25:01,685
Jonah, the fact is...

1238
01:25:01,768 --> 01:25:04,813
you're not gonna like any woman
because it isn't your mother.

1239
01:25:04,855 --> 01:25:06,482
How do you know?

1240
01:25:06,523 --> 01:25:09,985
-What's wrong with Annie?
-Oh, Jonah, shut up!

1241
01:25:10,068 --> 01:25:12,654
Shut up?

1242
01:25:12,696 --> 01:25:16,158
<i>Mom never said "shut up'' to me.
Mom never yelled at me.</i>

1243
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:19,369
-The conversation is finished.
-Why can't we go to New York?

1244
01:25:19,453 --> 01:25:22,206
There is no way
that we are going on a plane...

1245
01:25:22,289 --> 01:25:24,791
to meet some woman
who could be a crazy, sick lunatic.

1246
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:27,377
<i>-Didn't you see Fatal Attraction?
-You wouldn't let me.</i>

1247
01:25:27,461 --> 01:25:30,005
Well, I saw it!
And it scared the shit outta me.

1248
01:25:30,088 --> 01:25:33,175
It scared the shit
outta every man in America!

1249
01:25:34,092 --> 01:25:36,553
I'm not leaving till you say yes.

1250
01:25:42,309 --> 01:25:45,229
-I hate you!
-That's good!

1251
01:25:45,312 --> 01:25:46,855
You'll have to tell Oprah.

1252
01:25:46,939 --> 01:25:49,233
How your dad destroyed your life
'cause he had to go off...

1253
01:25:49,316 --> 01:25:52,861
for a weekend special
at the Holiday Inn!

1254
01:26:07,334 --> 01:26:10,754
Jonah, Clarise is here
and I gotta go.

1255
01:26:12,798 --> 01:26:14,466
Hey, Jonah.

1256
01:26:21,431 --> 01:26:23,767
All right.
Jonah, listen.

1257
01:26:23,809 --> 01:26:26,186
I gotta go, and I'm...

1258
01:26:54,631 --> 01:26:57,092
Jessica, honey,
you have to tell us where he is.

1259
01:26:57,176 --> 01:27:00,637
Jonah's daddy is very upset.

1260
01:27:00,679 --> 01:27:04,224
This is your father.
Tell us where he is, right this minute.

1261
01:27:07,519 --> 01:27:09,229
N.Y.

1262
01:27:09,313 --> 01:27:11,315
-What is that?
-No way.

1263
01:27:11,398 --> 01:27:13,984
That's N.W.

1264
01:27:14,067 --> 01:27:16,236
New York.

1265
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,238
He's on his way to New York.

1266
01:27:18,322 --> 01:27:19,781
-What?
-How?

1267
01:27:19,823 --> 01:27:23,076
-United 597.
-Jessica.

1268
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:25,787
-When does it leave?
-7:30.

1269
01:27:32,711 --> 01:27:35,756
Here you go. Here's a nice pen
for you for flying with us.

1270
01:27:35,839 --> 01:27:37,257
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1271
01:27:37,341 --> 01:27:39,593
-Can I take this for you?
-No.

1272
01:27:55,442 --> 01:27:57,778
-Where to, kid?
-Empire State Building.

1273
01:27:57,861 --> 01:28:00,697
Hold on.
Empire State Building.

1274
01:28:00,739 --> 01:28:04,117
Get a little further away
from the curb next time, mac.

1275
01:28:05,953 --> 01:28:07,204
There it is.

1276
01:28:07,287 --> 01:28:09,957
What you gonna do
when you get up there?

1277
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:12,167
-Spit off the top?
-No.

1278
01:28:12,251 --> 01:28:14,878
I'm going to meet my new mother.

1279
01:28:34,815 --> 01:28:37,734
Excuse me. I'm Jonah.
Are you Annie?

1280
01:28:37,776 --> 01:28:40,070
No. I'm Cynthia.

1281
01:28:47,161 --> 01:28:49,746
Excuse me.
Are you Annie?

1282
01:29:28,118 --> 01:29:30,037
Great table. Thanks.

1283
01:29:32,456 --> 01:29:34,208
Something wrong?

1284
01:29:35,375 --> 01:29:38,045
-Can I get you a drink?
-Some champagne?

1285
01:29:39,630 --> 01:29:42,132
Fine.

1286
01:29:42,174 --> 01:29:43,634
Can we have a bottle...

1287
01:29:43,675 --> 01:29:46,595
of Dom DeLuise?

1288
01:29:48,931 --> 01:29:50,849
-Just kidding.
-It was a joke.

1289
01:29:50,933 --> 01:29:53,560
-He meant Dom Perignon.
-I got it.

1290
01:29:57,147 --> 01:29:59,358
Beautiful view, isn't it?

1291
01:29:59,441 --> 01:30:04,279
Walter, there's something
I have to tell you.

1292
01:30:18,794 --> 01:30:21,213
Hey, I'm sorry.
I have an emergency.

1293
01:30:21,296 --> 01:30:23,966
Look! Money!
All right?

1294
01:30:24,049 --> 01:30:26,343
-Get right in.
-Wait a minute.

1295
01:30:26,385 --> 01:30:27,970
Taxi!

1296
01:31:41,793 --> 01:31:46,048
So, he could be on top
of the Empire State Building now.

1297
01:31:48,675 --> 01:31:50,719
I guess he could be.

1298
01:31:53,388 --> 01:31:55,808
It's not him, Walter.
It's me.

1299
01:31:57,434 --> 01:31:59,353
I can't do this.

1300
01:32:01,063 --> 01:32:03,690
Look, Annie...

1301
01:32:03,774 --> 01:32:07,444
I love you,
but let's leave that outta this.

1302
01:32:08,737 --> 01:32:11,615
I don't wanna be someone
that you're settling for.

1303
01:32:11,698 --> 01:32:15,577
I don't wanna be someone
that anyone settles for.

1304
01:32:17,204 --> 01:32:19,122
Marriage is hard enough...

1305
01:32:19,206 --> 01:32:22,960
without bringing such
low expectations into it.

1306
01:32:23,001 --> 01:32:24,461
Isn't it?

1307
01:32:25,337 --> 01:32:27,798
Walter, I don't deserve you.

1308
01:32:28,674 --> 01:32:31,135
I wouldn't put it that way.

1309
01:32:32,636 --> 01:32:34,972
But, okay.

1310
01:32:51,155 --> 01:32:52,447
You okay?

1311
01:32:53,365 --> 01:32:55,159
Yeah.

1312
01:33:00,455 --> 01:33:02,457
-What?
-Look.

1313
01:33:11,175 --> 01:33:14,261
<i>-It's a sign.
-Who needed a sign?</i>

1314
01:33:17,639 --> 01:33:19,308
I have to go.

1315
01:33:54,301 --> 01:33:58,639
What if something had happened to you?
What if I couldn't get to you?

1316
01:33:58,722 --> 01:34:01,517
I'm sorry.

1317
01:34:03,268 --> 01:34:05,813
What would I have done?

1318
01:34:05,896 --> 01:34:09,191
You are my family.
You're all I've got.

1319
01:34:09,233 --> 01:34:11,819
I thought she'd be here.
I thought she'd come.

1320
01:34:11,902 --> 01:34:14,488
We're doin' okay, aren't we?
Aren't we all right?

1321
01:34:14,571 --> 01:34:17,407
-Have I done anything really stupid?
-No.

1322
01:34:17,491 --> 01:34:19,993
-Have I screwed it up for both of us?
-No.

1323
01:35:13,672 --> 01:35:17,092
-Observation deck?
-Sorry, ma'am, but it's too late.

1324
01:35:18,302 --> 01:35:20,512
Please. I really need
to get up there.

1325
01:35:20,596 --> 01:35:23,015
We're closing up.
No more runs tonight.

1326
01:35:28,729 --> 01:35:30,981
Listen.

1327
01:35:31,064 --> 01:35:34,610
<i>Can I just take a look?
There's someone I was supposed to meet.</i>

1328
01:35:34,693 --> 01:35:37,321
He's probably not there,
but if I don't at least look...

1329
01:35:37,404 --> 01:35:39,823
I'll always wonder about it.

1330
01:35:39,907 --> 01:35:41,825
Cary Grant, right?

1331
01:35:41,909 --> 01:35:44,203
You know that movie?

1332
01:35:44,286 --> 01:35:46,538
One of my wife's favorites.

1333
01:35:55,297 --> 01:35:58,467
Maybe when we get home
we'll get a dog.

1334
01:35:58,509 --> 01:36:01,845
-Okay.
-What do you mean "okay"?

1335
01:36:01,887 --> 01:36:05,057
-Wouldn't you like to have a dog?
-Sure.

1336
01:36:17,861 --> 01:36:20,489
I'm sorry, ma'am. Empty.

1337
01:36:22,991 --> 01:36:25,869
Can I take a minute?

1338
01:36:25,911 --> 01:36:27,496
Go ahead.

1339
01:37:41,361 --> 01:37:43,530
I left it by the telescopes.

1340
01:38:10,390 --> 01:38:12,726
-It's you.
-It's me.

1341
01:38:12,810 --> 01:38:16,647
-I saw you in the street.
-Are you Annie?

1342
01:38:18,607 --> 01:38:20,484
Yes.

1343
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:25,155
You're Annie?

1344
01:38:27,825 --> 01:38:29,868
This must be yours.

1345
01:38:29,952 --> 01:38:33,163
I'm Jonah.
This is my dad.

1346
01:38:33,247 --> 01:38:35,165
-His name's Sam.
-Hi, Jonah.

1347
01:38:44,174 --> 01:38:46,260
-And who's this?
-Howard.

1348
01:38:46,343 --> 01:38:49,096
Oh, Howard.
Hello, Howard.

1349
01:39:04,528 --> 01:39:05,779
We better go.

1350
01:39:13,579 --> 01:39:15,539
Shall we?

1351
01:39:46,945 --> 01:39:51,200
<i>It's so important

1352
01:39:51,241 --> 01:39:55,370
<i>Make just one someone happy</i>

1353

<i>Make just one heart

1354

<i>-You sing to

1355
01:40:04,338 --> 01:40:06,548
It's nice to meet you.

1356
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:11,887
<i>One face that lights

<i>You're everything to</i>
