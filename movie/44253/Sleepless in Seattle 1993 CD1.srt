1
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,090
Mommy got sick.

2
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,100
It happened just like that.

3
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,510
There was nothing anybody could do.

4
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,580
It isn't fair.

5
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,650
There's no reason.

6
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,880
But if we start asking why,
we'll go crazy.

7
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,800
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one
of them. They're done. Ready to eat.

8
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,320
Do you know how to make juice?

9
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,020
Microwave. Five minutes.

10
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,370
Here.

11
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,940
My shrink. Call him.

12
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,320
"Loss of Spouse Support Group.

13
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,230
Chicago Cancer Family Network.

14
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,890
Parents Without Partners.
Partners Without Parents.

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,020
Hug Yourself. Hug a Friend.
Hug a Shrink. "

16
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,100
Or work. Work hard.

17
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,440
Work will save you. Work is the only
thing that will see you through this.

18
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,210
Don't mind him. He's just a guy
who's lost his wife.

19
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,850
What I think we really
need is a change.

20
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,090
Good idea. Take a couple of weeks off.
Get some sun. Take Jonah fishing.

21
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,900
No, a real change.

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,900
A new city.

23
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,600
Someplace where every time I go around
a corner I don't think of Maggie.

24
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,620
<i>Where you gonna go?</i>

25
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,180
I was thinking about Seattle.

26
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,990
Eventually, in a few months,
you'll start seeing women.

27
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,030
- You'll meet someone.
- Right.

28
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,690
Move on. Right.
That's what I'm gonna do.

29
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,600
And then in a few months, boom, I'll
be fine. I'll just grow a new heart.

30
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,870
- Sam, I'm sorry.
- She didn't mean that.

31
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,970
I know. Look,
it just doesn't happen twice.

32
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,810
<i>You must remember this</i>

33
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,820
<i>A kiss is still a kiss</i>

34
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,050
<i>A sigh is just a sigh</i>

35
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,890
<i>The fundamental things apply</i>

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,520
<i>As time goes by</i>

37
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,730
<i>And when two lovers woo</i>

38
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,670
<i>They still say, I love you</i>

39
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,750
<i>On that you can rely</i>

40
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,750
<i>No matter what the future brings</i>

41
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,590
<i>As time goes by</i>

42
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,820
<i>Moonlight and love songs</i>

43
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,730
<i>Never out of date</i>

44
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,300
<i>Hearts full of passion</i>

45
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,530
<i>Jealousy and hate</i>

46
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,940
<i>Woman needs man</i>

47
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,810
<i>And man must have his mate</i>

48
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,370
<i>That no one can deny</i>

49
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,520
<i>It's still the same old story</i>

50
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,520
<i>A fight for love and glory</i>

51
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,590
<i>A case of do or die</i>

52
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:06,470
<i>The world will
always welcome lovers</i>

53
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,270
<i>As time</i>

54
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,270
<i>Goes by</i>

55
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,690
The tall one with red hair
is your cousin Irene.

56
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,950
You'll recognize her by
the disappointed look on her face.

57
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,260
Who was married to Harold
who ran off with his secretary.

58
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,030
But came back because Irene threatened
to put the dog to sleep if he didn't.

59
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,540
Your brother Dennis
is a professor at Johns Hopkins.

60
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,470
He's married to Betsy.

61
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,880
The most competitive woman
in the world.

62
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,880
I don't see how
I'm gonna remember all this.

63
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,580
Oh, well, Walter, you will.

64
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,020
Your Uncle Milton
lost all of his money-

65
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,330
- And some other people's.
- In a pyramid scheme.

66
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,730
Don't mention the IRS
or the federal prison system.

67
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,540
Your mother's Barbara.
Your father's Cliff.

68
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,700
- My father has electric trains.
- Really?

69
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,910
Am I what they had in mind?

70
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,040
Oh, Walter,
they're gonna love you.

71
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,560
<i>Everybody.</i>

72
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,130
Annie has an announcement.

73
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,560
Walter and I are engaged.

74
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,600
Thank you. Thank you.

75
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,100
Dad, Mom knew.

76
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,540
- I don't see a ring, Annie.
- I don't have a ring yet.

77
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,550
Congratulations.

78
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,640
Bless you. Bless you.

79
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,250
- Oh, my goodness.
- Are you all right?

80
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,320
- It's nothing.
- Maybe it's the flowers.

81
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,260
- We'll move them.
- No! Don't touch them!

82
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,760
I feel terrible,
sneezing at a time like this.

83
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,890
This is a very
important moment for me.

84
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,020
He's allergic to everything.
Don't worry about it.

85
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,200
Bees. I'm allergic to bees.

86
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,210
Harold is allergic
to every type of bee.

87
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,210
We always have to carry a hypodermic
of adrenaline wherever we go.

88
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,710
If he eats even
one tiny piece of a nut-

89
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,250
My head swells up like
a watermelon, and I drop dead.

90
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,010
It's the same
with Harold and bees.

91
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,580
Your mother and I had salmon at our
wedding. A wedding without cold salmon-

92
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,630
- I'm not allergic to salmon.
- Oh, he's not allergic to salmon.

93
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,250
I don't think,
but you never know.

94
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,930
- You never know.
- Harold wasn't always allergic to bees.

95
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,940
Honey, what a shame. We had
some champagne. What did we use it for?

96
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,270
- Uncle Milton's parole.
- And it was delicious.

97
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,040
It was, wasn't it, Milton?

98
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,130
When are you getting married?

99
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,480
- In early June, in the garden.
- Does it have to be in the garden?

100
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,210
- What a great idea.
- What about Harold and bees?

101
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,650
- I'm allergic to bees.
- We'll spray you.

102
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,560
Cold salmon, a lovely
cucumber salad, strawberries.

103
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,120
I'm afraid I am allergic
to strawberries.

104
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,390
Allergic to strawberries.

105
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,630
Is this all right
with you, Walter?

106
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,070
Today I consider myself
the luckiest...

107
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,900
m- m-man on the f-f-face
of the E-E-Earth.

108
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,270
The Lou Gehrig line.
Remember? Remember, Dad?

109
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,540
<i>- The Lou Gehrig line from-
- Pride of the Yankees.</i>

110
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,770
<i>- Pride of the Yankees!
- Pride of the Yankees.</i>

111
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,280
- It's baseball.
- A historical reference.

112
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:49,190
I would like to propose a toast
to my kid sister.

113
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,020
To Walter and my baby.

114
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,030
To Walter and Annie.

115
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,600
Everyone, please eat
before it gets cold.

116
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,970
Here it is.

117
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:09,070
The historical society wanted this,
and I never would give it to them.

118
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,340
Oh, Mom!

119
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,070
I noticed these things
are back in fashion.

120
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,550
- Grandmother's dress.
- Oh, honey.

121
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,120
He's a lovely man, Annie.

122
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,250
I know. He is wonderful, isn't he?
And he's such a wonderful athlete.

123
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,490
- Are his folks nice?
- You'll love them.

124
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,460
We're going down to D.C. Tonight
to be with them Christmas morning.

125
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,730
- How did it happen?
- Well, it's silly, really.

126
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,740
I'd seen him at the office.
Obviously, I'd seen him.

127
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,740
He's the associate publisher.

128
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,680
One day we both ordered sandwiches
from the same place.

129
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,980
He got my lettuce and tomato on wheat,
which, of course, he was allergic to.

130
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,310
And I got his lettuce
and tomato on white.

131
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,790
- How amazing.
- It is, isn't it?

132
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,020
You make a million decisions
that mean nothing.

133
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,790
Then one day you order takeout,
and it changes your life.

134
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,990
Destiny takes a hand.

135
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,690
Mom, destiny is
something we've invented...

136
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,560
because we can't stand the fact that
everything that happens is accidental.

137
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:12,940
How do you explain that you both ordered
the same sandwich except for the bread?

138
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,410
How many people in this world
like lettuce and tomato...

139
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,410
without something else like tuna?

140
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:24,210
Well, it wasn't a sign.
It was a coincidence.

141
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,380
I was in Atlantic City with my family.
Cliff was a waiter.

142
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:33,190
He wasn't even supposed to work
that night, and suppose he hadn't?

143
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:37,030
He asked me to take a midnight walk
on the Steel Pier.

144
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:41,590
I've probably told you this
a million times, but I don't care.

145
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,100
Then he held my hand.

146
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,470
At one point I looked down
and I couldn't tell...

147
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,810
which fingers were his
and which were mine.

148
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,710
And I knew.

149
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,250
- What?
- You know.

150
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,680
- What?
- Magic.

151
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,420
It was magic.

152
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,010
Magic?

153
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:08,290
I knew we'd be together forever and
that everything would be wonderful...

154
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,130
just the way you feel about Walter.

155
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:16,260
Walter? It's quite
a formal name, isn't it?

156
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:19,830
One of the things I truly knew
was that your father and I...

157
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,640
were going to have
a wonderful time in-

158
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,040
- The sack, I believe you call it.
- Mom!

159
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,410
Of course, it took
several years before everything...

160
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,420
worked like clockwork
in that department.

161
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,510
So don't be worried
if it takes a while.

162
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,060
- Well, we already-
- Fine. Fine. Fiddle-de-dee.

163
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,180
- How's it working?
- Like clockwork.

164
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,490
Oh, honey.

165
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,260
- It's a sign.
- You don't believe in signs.

166
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,540
They loved you! I told you they
would love you, and they loved you!

167
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,340
- I love you.
- I love you, Walter.

168
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,890
Did anyone ever call you
anything other than Walter?

169
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,290
Nope.

170
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,360
Not even when you were young?

171
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,690
Nope, not even when I was young.

172
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,520
You sure you don't
want to drive with me?

173
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,470
How will I get back
to Baltimore on Friday?

174
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,970
I forgot the present. I left your
stepmother's present inside by accident.

175
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,270
When we're old and gray, you're gonna
have to remind me to put my teeth in.

176
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,010
I'll be walking all over town, smacking
my gums together and not even noticing.

177
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,180
- I'll wait.
- You'll wait? Oh! Right.

178
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,350
Don't wait. It's silly.
Go ahead. We're late anyway.

179
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,620
I'll be ten minutes behind you.

180
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,980
<i>Sleigh bells jing-a-ling
Ring-ting-ting-a-ling too</i>

181
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,990
<i>Horses, horses, horses</i>

182
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,030
<i>It's lovely weather
for a sleigh ride together with you</i>

183
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,030
<i>Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap</i>

184
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,160
<i>The snow is falling
and friends are calling, Yoo-hoo</i>

185
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,430
<i>Friends are calling, Yoo-hoo
Ding-a-ling-a-ling</i>

186
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,170
<i>Horses, horses, horses
Horses, horses, horses</i>

187
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,830
<i>Horses, horses, horses</i>

188
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,570
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way</i>

189
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,740
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh</i>

190
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,820
<i>Jingle bells</i>

191
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,250
<i>- Horses, horses, horses
- Welcome to "You and Your Emotions. "</i>

192
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,290
<i>- Laughing all the way
- I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone...</i>

<i>broadcasting live across America from
the top of the Sears Tower in Chicago.</i>

194
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,000
<i>Tonight we're talking
about wishes and dreams.</i>

195
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,660
<i>- What's your wish this Christmas Eve?
- What's your wish?</i>

196
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,430
<i>- Maybe the best gift you can give your-
- My wish is to turn the radio station.</i>

197
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,370
<i>Subject of this evening's medical update
is "You and Your Spleen. "</i>

198
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,100
<i>- Your host is-
- Not on your life.</i>

199
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:42,810
<i>Coming up, "Jingle Bells" backwards,
sung by the New Jersey-</i>

200
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,150
<i>- Seattle, go ahead.
- Hello, this is Jonah-</i>

201
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,810
<i>No last names, Jonah.</i>

202
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,220
<i>You sound younger than
our usual callers. How old are you?</i>

203
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,160
<i>- I'm eight.
- Eight. How come you're up so late?</i>

204
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,990
<i>- It's not that late in Seattle.
- Of course. You're absolutely right.</i>

205
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,300
<i>What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?</i>

206
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,340
<i>It's not for me. It's for my dad.
I think he needs a new wife.</i>

207
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,170
<i>- You don't like the one he has now?
- He doesn't have one now.</i>

208
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,830
<i>That's the problem.</i>

209
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,380
<i>- Where's your mom?
- She died.</i>

210
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,250
<i>- I'm so sorry to hear that.
- Well, who can believe this?</i>

211
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,340
<i>I've been pretty sad,
but I think my dad's worse.</i>

212
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,980
<i>Have you talked
to your dad about this?</i>

213
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,250
<i>- No.
- Why not?</i>

214
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,890
<i>- It's like it makes him sadder.
- I can understand that.</i>

215
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,560
<i>- Jonah, is your dad home right now?
- Yeah.</i>

216
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,300
<i>- What's he doing? Is he busy?
- Not really. He's out on the deck.</i>

217
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,600
<i>I'm sure that I can help, but I'm
going to need you to help me help him.</i>

218
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,800
<i>- Wretched woman!
- Bring your dad to the phone.</i>

219
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,440
<i>- Hang up, Jonah! Don't listen to her.
- No way. He'd kill me.</i>

220
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,070
<i>Trust me, Jonah.
He won't be angry...</i>

221
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,670
<i>when he realizes
how concerned you are about him.</i>

222
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,180
Wanna bet?

223
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,120
<i>If I get yelled at, I'm never
going to listen to your show again.</i>

224
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,490
<i>Fair enough.</i>

225
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,120
- Dad?
- Yeah?

226
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,390
There's someone
on the phone for you.

227
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,500
<i>- His name's Sam.
- Sam.</i>

228
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,510
<i>If you've just tuned in,
this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone.</i>

229
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,630
<i>Tonight's topic is
"Your Wishes and Dreams. "</i>

230
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,470
<i>- I got it.
- We're on the line with Seattle.</i>

231
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,070
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, Sam.</i>

232
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,880
<i>This is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone
on Network America.</i>

233
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:28,320
What are you selling tonight?
Micro hibachis or Ginza knives?

234
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,650
<i>I'm not selling anything.
I just want to help.</i>

235
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,660
<i>I want you to know
that your son called...</i>

236
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,660
<i>and he asked me for advice
on how you might find a new wife.</i>

237
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:43,100
<i>- Who is this?
- Dr. Fieldstone of Network America.</i>

238
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,110
<i>- You are on the air.
- You called a radio station?</i>

239
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:50,940
<i>- Sam? Sam? Sam, are you with me?
- Yeah. Yes.</i>

240
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,240
<i>Your son feels that since your wife's
death you've been very, very unhappy.</i>

241
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:58,880
<i>He's genuinely worried about you.</i>

242
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,390
Oh, hey, get out here.
Get out here.

243
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,790
I'm not gonna
go through this alone.

244
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:07,920
<i>I think it's very hard for him
to talk to you about all this.</i>

245
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,730
<i>I thought maybe you and I could talk.
It would make Jonah feel better.</i>

246
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,290
<i>- Sam?
- Talk to her, Dad. She's a doctor.</i>

247
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,300
Of what?
Her first name could be Doctor.

248
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,900
<i>- Please?
- Sam?</i>

249
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:24,500
<i>Sam, it's his Christmas wish.</i>

250
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,380
<i>- Okay.
- Okay, good.</i>

251
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,970
<i>I know this is difficult.</i>

252
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,080
<i>But how long ago
did your wife die?</i>

253
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,650
About a year and a half ago.

254
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,780
<i>Have you had
any relationships since?</i>

255
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,950
<i>- Nope.
- No?</i>

256
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,830
<i>Why not?</i>

257
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,630
Marcia- Or should
I call you Dr. Fieldstone?

258
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,210
<i>- Dr. Marcia.
- Dr. Marcia.</i>

259
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:57,640
<i>- I don't mean to be rude.
- I don't want to invade your privacy.</i>

260
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,040
<i>- Oh, sure you do.
- Sure you do.</i>

261
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,410
<i>Go on, Sam.
I'm listening.</i>

262
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,350
<i>Sam?</i>

263
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,920
We had a pretty
tough time there at first.

264
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,620
But we're dealing with it.

265
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,690
And Jonah and I will
get along just fine again...

266
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,830
as soon as I break his radio.

267
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,330
<i>I have no doubt that
you're a wonderful father.</i>

268
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,170
<i>- You can tell a lot from a voice.
- You certainly can.</i>

269
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,910
<i>But something must be missing if
Jonah still feels you're under a cloud.</i>

270
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,320
<i>Just a few questions.
Are you sleeping at night?</i>

271
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,480
- He doesn't sleep at all.
- How do you know that?

272
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,320
I live here.

273
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,400
Look, it's Christmas.

274
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,800
Maggie, my wife-

275
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,370
She really did it.

276
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,380
I mean, she loved-

277
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,900
She made everything beautiful.

278
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,880
<i>And it's just tough
this time of year.</i>

279
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,650
Any kid needs a mother.

280
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:18,520
<i>Could it be that you need someone
just as much as Jonah does?</i>

281
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,790
Yes.

282
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,230
<i>Don't answer that. Let's get into that
right after these messages.</i>

283
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,560
<i>Sam, Jonah, don't go away.</i>

284
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,940
<i>If you've just tuned in,
we're talking to Sleepless in Seattle.</i>

285
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,100
<i>We'll be right back after this break
with your listener response.</i>

286
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,010
What's she talking about?

287
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,170
This is when other people get to call in
and dump on what you said.

288
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:47,780
Oh, oh. This is really fun,
and helpful.

289
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,990
I'll bet he's tall
with a cute butt.

290
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,430
Bet he hasn't bathed in weeks
and he stinks.

291
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,870
Harriet, shut up.
Hi. Can I help you?

292
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,700
Tea with the bag out.

293
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,740
Maybe I'll hustle myself out to Seattle.
Give him a gift for New Year's Eve.

294
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,140
You go on out there if you want to,
but don't open his refrigerator.

295
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,110
They don't cover anything
when they put it in the fridge.

296
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,710
They just stick it in there and
leave it till it walks out by itself.

297
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,310
What I'm saying is, I wouldn't kick this
guy out of my bed for eating crackers.

298
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,320
You know what I'm saying?
Sixty-five cents.

299
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,050
<i>Let's take a call
before we get back to Sleepless.</i>

300
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,250
<i>Knoxville, Tennessee,
you're on the air. Talk to me.</i>

301
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,060
<i>Yes, I would just like to know
where I could get this man's address.</i>

302
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,330
<i>- Honey, get in line.
- We don't give that information.</i>

303
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,060
<i>Next caller, go ahead.</i>

304
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,670
<i>If there was one question
I was allowed to ask-</i>

305
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,970
Oh, go ahead.

306
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,140
<i>People who truly loved once
are far more likely to love again.</i>

307
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,620
<i>Do you think there's someone out there
you could love as much as your wife?</i>

308
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,550
<i>Well, Dr. Marcia Fieldstone,
that's hard to imagine.</i>

309
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,990
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

310
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,090
Well, I'm going to get
out of bed every morning...

311
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,430
breathe in and out all day long.

312
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:15,370
<i>Then after a while
I won't have to remind myself...</i>

313
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,610
<i>to get out of bed in the morning
and breathe in and out.</i>

314
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:25,540
And then after a while
I won't have to think about how...

315
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,780
I had it great and perfect
for a while.

316
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:33,620
<i>Sam, tell me what was
so special about your wife?</i>

317
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,290
<i>Well, how long is your program?</i>

318
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,860
<i>Oh, well, it was a-</i>

319
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,870
<i>It was a million
tiny little things.</i>

320
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:49,000
<i>When you added them all up, it just
meant we were supposed to be together.</i>

321
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:53,210
<i>And I knew it. I knew it
the very first time I touched her.</i>

322
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,250
It was like coming home...

323
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,480
only to no home I'd ever known.

324
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,580
I was just taking her hand...

325
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:05,990
to help her out of a car...

326
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,580
and I knew it.

327
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,260
<i>It was like-</i>

328
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,930
<i>- Magic.
- Magic.</i>

329
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,630
<i>Well, folks,
it's time to wrap it up.</i>

330
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,330
<i>I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone
in Chicago.</i>

331
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,900
<i>And to all my listeners,
a magical and merry Christmas.</i>

332
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:29,920
<i>And to you, Sleepless in Seattle,
we hope you'll call again soon.</i>

333
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,210
<i>- Let us know how it's going.
- Oh, you can count on it.</i>

334
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:38,880
<i>When you find me</i>

335
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:43,560
<i>I know somewhere</i>

336
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:49,100
<i>Over the rainbow</i>

337
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,740
<i>The bluebirds glide</i>

338
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,650
<i>Birds fly</i>

339
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:08,050
<i>Over the rainbow</i>

340
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:13,390
<i>Why, then, oh, why</i>

341
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,790
<i>Can't I</i>

342
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,070
This man sells the greatest soup
you've ever eaten...

343
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,300
and he is the meanest man
in America.

344
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:32,000
I feel very strongly about this, Becky.
It's not just about the soup.

345
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,210
- Do it. What else?
- New Year's Eve.

346
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,750
<i>- Please don't make me write it.
- Listen to this.</i>

347
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,950
"Phone service in the greater Chicago
area was tied up for two hours...

348
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,520
Christmas Eve when some kid
calls a phone-in radio show...

349
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,520
and says that his dad
needs a new wife.

350
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:49,030
Two thousand women called the station
asking for the guy's number. "

351
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:52,360
I heard it. This kid calls up
and says, "My dad needs a wife. "

352
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,030
This shrink forces the guy to the phone
and says, "You want to talk about it?"

353
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,630
He says, "No,
as a matter of fact, I don't. "

354
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,770
Suddenly, for no reason at all, he talks
about how much he loved his wife...

355
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,840
and how he just
fell in love with her...

356
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,880
like he was one
of those cows in Michigan.

357
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,040
<i>- What cows in Michigan?
- It was on 60 Minutes.</i>

358
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,280
There were those cows
that got zapped by stray voltage.

359
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,010
No one knows why.
Maybe it was Wisconsin.

360
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,390
But anyway, I was listening to him
talk about how much he loved his wife...

361
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,890
and suddenly I was crying.

362
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,230
It's like what happens when
I watch those phone company ads.

363
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,320
I don't have to see the whole thing,
just the part where...

364
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:28,370
the daughter gives the mother the
refrigerator with the big red bow on it.

365
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:32,570
<i>The Polaroid commercial. Two 5-year-olds
at their grandfather's birthday party.</i>

366
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,570
- They're making the album.
- With the glue.

367
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,340
That kills me.

368
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,850
You should write
something about this.

369
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,440
- About what?
- Whatever it is.

370
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:46,280
I'll tell you. Two thousand women
calling a radio station for a husband.

371
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,290
There are a lot of desperate women
out there lookin' for love.

372
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,290
Especially over a certain age.

373
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,590
It's easier to be killed by a terrorist
than get married over the age of 40.

374
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,590
That is not true.
That statistic is not true.

375
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,820
That's right. It's not true.
But it feels true.

376
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,830
It feels true
because it is true.

377
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,560
There's practically a whole book
about how that's not true.

378
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:05,660
- Calm down. You brought it up.
- I did not, Wyatt.

379
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,940
- Did you even read that book?
- Did anyone read it all the way through?

380
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,100
Are you two finished?
Fine. Now where were we?

381
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:16,340
If someone is a widower,
why do they say that he was widowed?

382
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,180
Why don't they say
he was widowered?

383
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,790
I was just wondering.

384
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,860
What was that about up there?

385
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,830
- What was what?
- What's with you?

386
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:32,700
<i>- Nothing's with me.
- Something's with you.</i>

387
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,260
- What are you saying?
- Whatever it is, you can tell me.

388
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,840
Sleepless in Seattle?

389
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,570
That's what she called him on the show
because he can't sleep.

390
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,730
And now 2,000 women
want his number.

391
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,240
The guy could be a crackhead,
a transvestite...

392
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,580
a flasher, a junkie,
a chain-saw murderer...

393
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,780
or someone really sick,
someone like my Rick.

394
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,560
- Actually, he sounded nice.
- Oh?

395
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,990
Oh, really?
Now we're getting down to it.

396
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,000
Please. Becky,
I'm madly in love with Walter.

397
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,260
He did the craziest thing
the other night. What was that?

398
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:15,270
Oh, it was so funny.
We were hysterical. What was that?

399
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,120
You know, I've got to go to Boston
for the convention, right?

400
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,420
Then I got to visit Winston-Hughes
about switching over our computers.

401
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:40,970
<i>But why don't we meet in New York
for Valentine's Day weekend?</i>

402
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:44,160
Walter, I'd love to!

403
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,930
We can stay at the Plaza.

404
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,410
Ice-stake in Central Park.

405
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,740
Register.

406
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,540
Register?

407
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:58,240
You know, for dishes,
glasses, silver, everything.

408
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,220
How about it?

409
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,360
I'll take you to Chinatown
for dim sum.

410
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,400
- Does it have wheat in it?
- I don't think so.

411
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,890
<i>Dim sum, dim sum</i>

412
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,730
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...</i>

413
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:29,150
five, four, three, two, one!

414
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,850
Hey, Jonah. Wake up. Wake up, man.
The ball's droppin'.

415
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,480
<i>Happy new year!</i>

416
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:45,320
<i>Okay, pal. I got ya.</i>

417
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,660
It's okay.

418
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,760
There we go.

419
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,500
Happy new year.

420
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,570
Happy new year.

421
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,080
Kiss Howard.

422
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,240
Good night, Howard.

423
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,760
<i>Sometimes I wonder</i>

424
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:57,000
<i>Why I spend</i>

425
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,400
<i>The lonely night</i>

426
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,970
<i>Dreaming of a song</i>

427
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,640
<i>The melody</i>

428
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,310
<i>Haunts my reverie</i>

429
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:16,620
<i>And I am once again with you</i>

430
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,250
<i>When our love was new</i>

431
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,030
<i>And each kiss an inspiration</i>

432
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:33,200
<i>But that was long ago</i>

433
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:37,210
<i>Now my consolation</i>

434
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:42,180
<i>Is in the stardust of a song</i>

435
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:47,850
<i>Beside the garden wall</i>

436
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,260
<i>When stars are bright</i>

437
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,850
<i>You are in my arms</i>

438
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,830
<i>The nightingale</i>

439
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:02,270
<i>Tells his fairy tale</i>

440
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,330
<i>Of paradise where roses bloom</i>

441
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,500
Can I have half your beer?

442
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,770
Sure. Go ahead.

443
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:17,040
What did I used to say?

444
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,280
"Here's looking at you"?

445
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,290
"Here's mud in your eye"?

446
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,690
"Here's to us. "

447
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:28,090
You used to say, "Here's to us. "

448
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:35,930
Oh, babe.
I miss you so much it hurts.

449
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,440
- What do you want to do?
- We'll tell him when he gets here.

450
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,790
You want to tell him.
I don't mind telling him.

451
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:00,590
- She's here.
- She's back. She has another idea.

452
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,630
I don't need-
Claire, how are you?

453
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,320
I'm so glad you're here.
I heard you on the radio.

454
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,920
- I told everyone about it.
- We already knew.

455
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,260
- How did you-
- Grace.

456
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,500
The dispatcher?
All of Seattle knows.

457
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,010
I was brushing my teeth
and suddenly there you were.

458
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:18,170
I couldn't believe my ears.
I called my mother in Las Vegas.

459
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:23,080
I said, "Mother, turn on the radio.
That's my architect. "

460
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,980
It is so nice...

461
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,450
when a man
can express his feelings.

462
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,420
<i>- It's wonderful.
- I wish I could express my feelings.</i>

463
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:37,730
- So, Claire, is there a problem?
- I was tossing and turning last night.

464
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:43,100
I realized I'm never going to fit my
platters in the refrigerator we ordered.

465
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,570
When I give parties,
I always put in platters.

466
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:49,010
So I thought I would get the Sub-Zero
refrigerator instead. The only problem-

467
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,010
We have to redo all the cabinets.

468
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:54,480
- We'll be into this wall.
- That's a bearing wall.

469
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,880
That's a delay, Claire, of-

470
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,880
- Two, three-
- Five, six-

471
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,920
- Twelve weeks.
- I don't mind.

472
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,490
The important thing
is to get it right.

473
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,520
- Absolutely.
- Your words.

474
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,320
<i>I've got to rush.
La d¨¦corateur calls.</i>

475
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,590
- Bye!
- Bye-bye.

476
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:16,470
Well, this is fate.
She's divorced.

477
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,700
We don't want to redo the cabinets,
and you need a wife.

478
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,430
What do they call that
when everything intersects?

479
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,480
The Bermuda Triangle.

480
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:36,750
And here's another one.
You got room for one more here?

481
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,830
There you go.
You all right there?

482
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,860
<i>- Look at this, Dad. They're all for you.
- Yes, sir. There you go.</i>

483
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,930
"Sleepless in Seattle.
In care of Dr. Marcia Fieldstone"?

484
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,740
If you have trouble sleeping, drink
a glass of water from the other side.

485
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,310
- I thought that was for hiccups.
- Does it work for hiccups?

486
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:00,070
For hiccups, take a spoonful of sugar
and hold it in your mouth for a minute.

487
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:04,010
- Really?
- Thank you.

488
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,380
What possessed you
to give them our address?

489
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,550
They called and asked for it.

490
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,780
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle...

491
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:15,660
You're the most attractive man
I ever laid ears on. "

492
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,390
Wait, wait, wait. They called?
How did they get our number?

493
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,560
Let me guess.
You gave it to them.

494
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,690
You have to give them your phone number,
or they won't let you on the air.

495
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,670
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle,
I live in Tulsa. "

496
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:31,210
<i>- Where's that?
- It's in Oklahoma.</i>

497
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:34,010
- Do you know where Oklahoma is?
- Somewhere in the middle.

498
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,310
I'm not even gonna think about
what they're not teaching you in school.

499
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,850
Yeah, it's somewhere
in the middle.

500
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:45,050
Generally speaking, we should rule out
anyone that doesn't live near here.

501
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,920
She's willing to fly anywhere.

502
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:52,230
<i>She looks like my third grade teacher.
I hated my third grade teacher.</i>

503
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:56,360
Wait a minute.
She is my third grade teacher!

504
00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:01,200
- Aren't you gonna read any of these?
- This is not how it's done.

505
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:04,610
I'd much rather
just see somebody I like...

506
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:08,010
and get a feeling about them...

507
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,240
and ask them
if they want to have a drink.

508
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,250
- Or a slice of pizza?
- Not dinner.

509
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,450
Not necessarily on the first date.

510
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,950
Halfway through dinner you could be
really sorry you asked them to dinner.

511
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,030
Whereas, if it's just a drink...

512
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,620
if you like them,
you could always ask them to dinner.

513
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,250
But if not, you can just say,
"Well, that was great. "

514
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,820
And then you go home.
See what I mean?

515
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,100
I wonder if
it still works this way.

516
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,470
- It doesn't. They ask you.
- I'm starting to notice that.

517
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:40,140
<i>If you get a new wife, I guess
you'll have sex with her, huh?</i>

518
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,720
I certainly hope so.

519
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:47,220
- Will she scratch up your back?
- What?

520
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:52,050
In movies, women are always scratching
up the man's back and screaming.

521
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,030
- How do you know this?
- Jed's got cable.

522
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,290
Oh, Jed's got cable.

523
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,860
Hand me that towel
behind you, please.

524
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,510
- Thank you.
- I need it too.

525
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:12,310
Here. Let me get you.
Jed's got cable.

526
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:14,970
<i>Another bride</i>

527
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,680
<i>Another groom</i>

528
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:23,150
<i>Another sunny honeymoon</i>

529
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,990
<i>Another season</i>

530
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:30,690
<i>And that's the reason
for makin' whoopee</i>

531
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:50,720
<i>When the sun is high
in the afternoon sky</i>

532
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:55,150
<i>You can always
find something to do</i>

533
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:01,130
<i>But from dusk till dawn
as the clock ticks on</i>

534
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:07,960
<i>Something happens to you</i>

535
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:12,560
<i>In the wee small hours</i>

536
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:16,270
<i>Of the morning</i>

537
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,010
<i>While the whole wide world</i>

538
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:24,170
<i>Is fast asleep</i>

539
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,080
<i>You lie awake</i>

540
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:32,180
<i>And think about the boy</i>

541
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:35,090
<i>And never ever think</i>

542
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,360
<i>Of counting sheep</i>

543
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,960
<i>Welcome back to
the "Best of Dr. Marcia Fieldstone"...</i>

544
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,800
<i>clinical psychologist
and the friend you never had.</i>

545
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:49,900
<i>- Remember Marooned in Miami?
- He says he doesn't love me anymore.</i>

546
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,910
<i>Why would you want to be
with someone who doesn't love you?</i>

547
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,980
<i>Disappointed in Denver.</i>

548
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:59,140
<i>Every time I come close to orgasm,
he goes to make himself a sandwich.</i>

549
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,350
<i>Why don't you make him
a sandwich beforehand?</i>

550
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,350
<i>Sleepless in Seattle.</i>

551
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:08,790
<i>Well, I'm going to get
out of bed every morning...</i>

552
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,660
<i>and breathe in and out all day long.</i>

553
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:17,100
<i>Then after a while
I won't have to remind myself...</i>

554
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,940
<i>to get out of bed in the morning
and breathe in and out.</i>

555
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:28,910
<i>And then after a while
I won't have to think about how...</i>

556
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,950
<i>I had it great and perfect
for a while.</i>

557
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:37,720
<i>Sam, tell me what was
so special about your wife?</i>

558
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,760
<i>Well, how long is your program?</i>

559
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:46,090
<i>Oh, well, it was a-</i>

560
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,130
<i>It was a million
tiny little things.</i>

561
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,170
<i>When you added them all up, it just
meant we were supposed to be together.</i>

562
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:57,900
<i>And I knew it. I knew it
the very first time I touched her.</i>

563
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,340
<i>It was like coming home...</i>

564
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:03,610
<i>only to no home I'd ever known.</i>

565
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,710
<i>I was just taking her hand...</i>

566
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,480
<i>to help her out of a car...</i>

567
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,790
<i>and I knew it.</i>

568
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:15,550
<i>It was like...</i>

569
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,560
<i>magic.</i>

570
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,950
<i>I think I'm going crazy, Dennis.
Are you happily married?</i>

571
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,990
- What?
- I mean, why did you get married?

572
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,420
Was it all trumpets
and fireworks?

573
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,660
I got married because Betsy said
we had to break up or get married...

574
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,430
so we got married.

575
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,930
But when you first met her...

576
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,530
did you believe
she was the only person for you?

577
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,770
That in some mystical,
cosmic way it was fated?

578
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,710
Annie, when you're
attracted to someone...

579
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,680
it just means that your subconscious
is attracted to their subconscious...

580
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,610
subconsciously.

581
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,410
<i>What we think of as fate is two neuroses
knowing they're a perfect match.</i>

582
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,760
I don't even know him.

583
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:22,660
I am having all of these fantasies
about some man I have never even met...

584
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,750
who lives in Seattle!

585
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,920
It rains nine months
of the year in Seattle.

586
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:31,970
I know! I know!
I do not want to move to Seattle.

587
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,330
But what I really don't want
to do is end up always wondering...

588
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:41,710
what might have happened
and knowing I could have done something.

589
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,010
What do you think?

590
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,020
It's just cold feet, isn't it?

591
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,150
Everybody panics before
they get married. Didn't you?

592
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,890
- I did.
- You did.

593
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:55,320
Thank you very much, Dennis. I feel so
much better just having blown this off.

594
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,730
Anytime.

595
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:00,660
Sandy has a girlfriend, Glenda.
She's a weight lifter.

596
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,760
It's not like her neck
is bigger than her head.

597
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:06,860
I'm not asking you to set me up.
I don't need your help with that.

598
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:10,030
I just want to know
what it's like out there.

599
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,630
That's what I'm trying to tell you,
what women are lookin' for.

600
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,210
Pecs and a cute butt.

601
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,910
<i>- Like, "He has the cutest butt"?
- Yeah.</i>

602
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,850
- Where did I hear that recently?
- Everywhere.

603
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,580
You can't even turn on the news
nowadays without hearing about...

604
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:26,560
how some babe thought
some guy's butt was cute.

605
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,100
Who the first woman to say this was,
I don't know. But it caught on.

606
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,320
So how's my butt?

607
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,900
- Not bad.
- Really?

608
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,970
- Is it cute though?
- I don't know.

609
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,040
Are we grading on a curve?

610
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,630
When's the last time
you were out there?

611
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,820
Jimmy Carter, 1978.

612
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,180
Things are
a little different now.

613
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:57,650
First you have to be friends.
You have to like each other.

614
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,590
Then you neck.
This could go on for years.

615
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,250
Then you have tests.
Then you get to do it with a condom.

616
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,490
The good news is,
you split the check.

617
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,060
I don't think I could
let a woman pay for dinner.

618
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,540
Great. They'll throw
a parade in your honor.

619
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,100
<i>You'll be man of the year
in Seattle magazine.</i>

620
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:19,040
Tiramisu.

621
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,010
- What is tiramisu?
- You'll find out.

622
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,740
- What is it?
- You'll see.

623
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:26,720
Some woman will want me to do it to her.
I'm not going to know what it is.

624
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,220
<i>You'll love it.</i>

625
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,820
This is going to be tough.
Tough, tough.

626
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,980
This is going to be much tougher
than I thought it was going to be.

627
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:37,430
How about that decorator
on the Bennett job?

628
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,930
- Victoria?
- Yeah, she's perk.

629
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:43,130
- No, I don't-
- Come on!

630
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,860
I'm far away from that.

631
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:47,270
- I'm just assembling notes.
- Notes.

632
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:50,000
- How would I do that?
- What do you mean? Call her up.

633
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,130
You say, "Let's get together.
We'll look at swatches. "

634
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,040
Call her on the phone?
Say, "Let's look at swatches"?

635
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:57,910
- Color schemes.
- She's not gonna see through that?

636
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,920
You don't do it like I do it.
You do it in your own suave way.

637
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,650
Think Cary Grant.

638
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,890
Cary Grant would say,
"Come look at my swatches"?

639
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:11,290
Maybe he did. I know
he didn't do it in the movies.

640
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,920
<i>Gunga Din?</i>

641
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:15,300
<i>Gunga Din is not
a swatch kind of movie.</i>

642
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,840
Who knows what
he did in real life?

643
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,800
But he did that
with Dyan Cannon?

644
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:23,400
"Hello, Dyan.
Take a look at these swatches. "

645
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,530
Jonah, I'm home.

646
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:48,930
Hey, Jonah!

647
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,440
Hi, Dad. This is Jessica.

648
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:14,620
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Jessica.

649
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:18,750
<i>Dad, this is amazing. If you play this
backwards, it says, "Paul is dead. "</i>

650
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,160
Yeah, I know.

651
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:24,000
How do you know?

652
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,860
Dad, could you shut the door?

653
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,140
Sure. Sure.

654
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,870
H and G.

655
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,010
Hi and good-bye.

656
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,460
<i>I'm back in the saddle again</i>

657
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:30,300
<i>Out where a friend is a friend</i>

658
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,000
<i>Where the longhorn cattle feed
on the lowly jimsonweed</i>

659
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:39,100
<i>Back in the saddle again</i>

660
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:43,410
<i>Ridin' the range once more</i>

661
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,380
<i>Totin' my old. 44</i>

662
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,650
<i>Where you sleep out every night</i>

663
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,020
Hello, Victoria?

664
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:57,150
This is Sam Baldwin.
I don't know if you remember me, but-

665
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:01,090
Oh, great. Hi.

666
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,230
I was wondering if-

667
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:09,430
if you would like
to have a drink with me?

668
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,940
Dinner?

669
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,940
Dinner would be even better.

670
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:19,540
Friday would be great.
Yeah. How-

671
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:22,090
I hear that's a good place.

672
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:29,320
How- 7:30 would be fine.
And I'Il-

673
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,500
Okay, I'll meet you there. Okay.

674
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:38,200
So it's Friday...

675
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,570
at 7:30 for dinner.

676
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,070
Great.

677
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,230
Me too. Bye.

678
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:50,280
<i>Back in the saddle again</i>

679
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:54,580
<i>Are you in love with him?</i>

680
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:58,990
<i>I'm not now.</i>

681
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:03,920
Now those were the days
when people knew how to be in love.

682
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:06,120
- You're a basket case.
- They knew it.

683
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:11,430
Time, distance, nothing could separate
them, because they knew it was right.

684
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:14,560
- It was real. It was-
- A movie.

685
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,570
That's your problem.
You don't want to be in love.

686
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,800
You want to be
in love in a movie.

687
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:20,470
Read it to me.

688
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:26,310
"Dear Sleepless and Son, I have never
written a letter like this in my life. "

689
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,880
That's what everyone writes at
the beginning of letters to strangers.

690
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:33,250
I know that.
You think I don't know that?

691
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,090
What about Walter?

692
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:40,150
Walter. Oh, I would
give anything to marry Walter.

693
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,360
He's so unexpected.

694
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:47,460
You think you can tell what he's like
by just looking at him, but you can't.

695
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:50,010
I should write something
in this about magic.

696
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:51,700
- What?
- Something.

697
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:55,510
What if I never meet him? What if this
man is my destiny and I never meet him?

698
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,520
Your destiny can be your doom.
Look at me and Rick.

699
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,550
"I want to meet you-"

700
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:03,990
<i>- The top of the Empire State Building?
- The top of the Empire State Building.</i>

701
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,850
<i>That's perfect.</i>

702
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,360
Sunset, Valentine's Day.

703
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:13,760
I'll be in New York with Walter.
I can squeeze it in.

704
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:16,630
I'll be in New York with Walter.

705
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,710
Do you want to
hear about destiny?

706
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:29,680
<i>If I hadn't married Martin, I wouldn't
have had the house with the dead tree.</i>

707
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:32,180
On account of which,
I got divorced.

708
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:36,050
On account of which, I hit a car
and met Rick while buying a neck brace.

709
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,350
Wait. You never told me you got
a divorce because of a dead tree.

710
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:42,730
The tree man.

711
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:44,820
You fell in love
with the tree man?

712
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:47,730
I did not say "love. "
Did I say "love"?

713
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:50,200
This is my favorite part.

714
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:54,170
<i>It's now or never.</i>

715
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,370
<i>"Never" is a frightening word.</i>

716
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:01,480
<i>We'd be fools
to let happiness pass us by.</i>

717
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:08,280
<i>Winter must be cold
for those with no warm memories.</i>

718
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:13,460
<i>We've already missed the spring.</i>

719
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,290
Men never get this movie.

720
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,960
I know.

721
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,400
Mommy! Mommy!

722
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:29,870
It's okay. I'm here.

723
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,340
- Dad!
- I'm comin'.

724
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,500
It's all right. It's okay.

725
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,920
It's all right. It's okay.
What was that about?

726
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,210
- It was sinking.
- What was?

727
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,620
Our house. There was water
coming in all the windows.

728
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:49,520
Well, it's okay now.

729
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:54,290
It's all right.
So what should we do?

730
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,800
Your mother used to...

731
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,300
sing to you
when you had bad dreams.

732
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:02,130
"Bye-Bye, Blackbird. "

733
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:07,840
I miss her.

734
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:10,780
What do you think happens
to someone after they die?

735
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:15,750
- I don't know.
- Like, do you believe in heaven?

736
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,150
I never did.

737
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:25,630
Or the whole idea of an afterlife,
but now I don't know.

738
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,430
'Cause I have
these dreams about-

739
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,140
about your mom.

740
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:38,570
And we have long talks...

741
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:42,210
about you,
how you're doin'.

742
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:46,010
Which she sort of knows,
but I tell her anyway.

743
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,350
So what is that?

744
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:52,680
It's sort of an afterlife,
isn't it?

745
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:55,460
I'm starting to forget her.

746
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:15,240
She could peel an apple...

747
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,080
in one long...

748
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:21,090
curly strip.

749
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:25,020
The whole apple.

750
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,920
<i>Pack up all my cares and woes</i>

751
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,820
<i>Feelin' low</i>

752
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:33,690
<i>Here I go</i>

753
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,760
<i>I say bye-bye</i>

754
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,340
I love you, Jonah.

755
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:42,740
