1
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:44,669
Mummy got sick.
It happened just like that.

2
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:49,048
Nobody could stop it.

3
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:53,010
It isn't fair.
There's no reason.

4
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:58,891
And if we start asking why, we'll go crazy.

5
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:26,169
Five minutes in the microwave.
Any one of them.

6
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,466
Do you know how to make juice?

7
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:37,972
Microwave. Five minutes.

8
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:58,284
Here. It's my shrink.
Call him.

9
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:11,506
Loss of Spouse Support Group.

10
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:17,136
Chicago Cancer Family Network.
Parents without Partners.

11
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:21,682
"Hug Yourself",
"Hug a Friend", "Hug a Shrink"...

12
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:27,772
Work hard, that'll save you.
Only work will see you through this.

13
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:38,032
Don't mind him,
he's just a guy who's lost his wife.

14
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,374
What I think we really need is...
change.

15
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:51,963
Good idea. Take a few weeks off,
take Jonah fishing.

16
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:58,177
No, real change.
A new city.

17
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:04,267
Some place where I don't think
of Maggie at every corner.

18
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,025
Where are you gonna go?

19
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,616
I was thinking about Seattle.

20
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:26,455
In a few months, you'll be seeing
women. You'll meet someone.

21
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:33,421
Move on, fine, that's what I'll do.
I'll just grow a new heart.

22
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:39,844
- Sam, I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
- I know. But it can't happen twice.

- The tall redhead is cousin Irene.
- You'll see her disappointed look.

45
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:41,549
- Harold ran off with the secretary.
- Until Irene had the dog put down.

46
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:46,554
Your brother Dennis
is professor at Johns Hopkins.

47
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:52,351
- He's married to... Betsy.
- The most competitive woman ever.

48
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:57,023
- How will I remember all this?
- Walter, you will!

49
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:13,622
- Uncle Milton lost all his money...
- And some other people's.

50
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,377
...in a pyramid scheme. Don't
mention the IRS or the prisons.

51
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,922
Your mother's Barbara, your father's Cliff...

52
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,968
- He has electric trains.
- Really?

53
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,055
Am I what they had in mind?

54
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:33,476
Walter, they're gonna love you!

55
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:41,067
Everybody, Annie has an announcement.

56
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,987
Walter and I are engaged.

57
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:53,204
Thank you. Thank you.

58
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,128
Congratulations, Walter.

59
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,007
Bless you!

60
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:11,680
- Are you all right?
- Maybe it's the flowers.

61
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:16,185
- We'll move them.
- No! I feel terrible, sneezing now.

62
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:21,440
- This is a very important moment.
- He's allergic to everything.

63
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:25,111
Bees.
I'm allergic to bees.

64
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:31,033
He's allergic to all bees.
We have to take adrenalin with us.

65
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:37,665
- If he eats just a bit of a nut...
- My head swells, and I drop dead.

66
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:42,044
- It's the same with him and bees.
- We had salmon at our wedding.

67
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:48,008
- A wedding without salmon is...
- I'm not allergic to salmon.

68
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,678
But you never know.

69
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:54,974
- You never know.
- He wasn't always allergic to bees.

70
00:07:55,142 --> 00:08:02,439
- What did we do with our champagne?
- Uncle Milton's parole.

71
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:07,862
- When are you getting married?
- Early June, in the garden.

72
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:15,035
- What about Harold and bees?
- I'm allergic to bees.

73
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,914
Cold salmon, cucumber salad, strawberries.

74
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:24,253
I'm afraid I am allergic to strawberries.

75
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,549
Is this all right with you?

76
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:34,555
I'm the luckiest man-man-man on
the face of the earth-earth-earth.

77
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:40,769
- That's Lou Gehrig's line from...
- Pride of the Yankees.

78
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:45,691
- Pride of the Yankees!
- Baseball. An historical reference.

79
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:50,613
I would like to propose a toast.
To my kid sister!

80
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,742
To Walter and my baby.

81
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,957
Please eat, before it gets cold.

82
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:10,507
Here it is. I wouldn't
give it to the Historical Society.

83
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:15,429
- Oh, Mum...
- These things are back in fashion.

84
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,766
Grandmother's dress.

85
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:25,898
- He's a lovely man, Annie.
- He is, isn't he?

86
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:32,738
And he's a wonderful athlete.
We're going to DC to see his parents.

87
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:37,034
- How did it happen?
- It's silly, really.

88
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:42,373
I'd seen him at the office.
He's the associate publisher.

89
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,210
We had both ordered sandwiches...

90
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:50,547
...and he got my tomato on wheat,
which he's allergic to.

91
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:55,177
And I got his tomato on white.
Amazing, isn't it?

92
00:09:55,345 --> 00:10:00,349
You make a million decisions,
and a sandwich changes your life.

93
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,269
Destiny takes a hand.

94
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:09,149
We invented destiny, because we
don't want things to be accidental.

95
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:14,446
Then why did you order the same
sandwich except for the bread?

96
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:21,578
How many people like tomato
without something else, like tuna?

97
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:25,666
It wasn't a sign.
It was a coincidence.

98
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:30,129
I was in Atlantic City,
where Cliff was a waiter.

99
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:34,758
He wasn't supposed to work
that night. What if he hadn't?

100
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:42,766
He asked me to take a midnight walk.
I told you this a million times.

101
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:51,150
He held my hand. I looked down
and couldn't tell our fingers apart.

102
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:55,904
- And I knew.
- What?

103
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:03,245
- What?
- It was magic.

104
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,164
Magic.

105
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:12,463
I knew we'd be together forever.
Just like you and Walter.

106
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,009
Walter. It's quite a formal name.

107
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:23,932
I knew that your father and I
would have a wonderful time in...

108
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,603
...the sack, I believe you call it.

109
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:34,068
It took years before it worked
like clockwork. It takes time.

110
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:39,365
- We already...
- Fine, fine. How's it working?

111
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:44,578
- Like clockwork.
- Oh, honey...

112
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:51,668
- It's a sign.
- You don't believe in signs.

113
00:11:56,466 --> 00:12:00,761
They loved you.
I told you they would.

114
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:04,306
- I love you.
- I love you, Walter.

115
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:11,397
Did anyone ever call you
anything other than Walter?

116
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:17,945
- Not even when you were young?
- Not even when I was young.

117
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:22,825
- Don't you want to drive with me?
- Then I can't get back on Friday.

118
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:28,914
I forgot your stepmother's present.
When we're old and gray...

119
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:35,295
...you must remind me to put my teeth
in, so I don't go out without them.

120
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,382
- I'll wait.
- You'll wait? Oh, right.

121
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:43,646
No, go ahead. We're late anyway.
I'll be ten minutes behind you.

Welcome to "You and Emotions."

136
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:23,051
I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone,
broadcasting live from Chicago.

137
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:29,057
Tonight we'll talk about wishes.
What's your wish this Christmas?

138
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:33,937
My wish is to change the station.

139
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:39,359
- And now: "You and your spleen."
- Not on your life.

140
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:44,281
Coming up, "Jingle Bells" backwards, sung by...

141
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:48,619
- Seattle, go ahead.
- This is Jonah...

142
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:53,499
No last names, Jonah.
How old are you?

143
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,710
- I'm eight.
- You're up late.

144
00:13:56,878 --> 00:14:02,591
- It's not so late in Seattle.
- You're right. What's your wish?

145
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,430
- My dad needs a new wife.
- You don't like the one he has?

146
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:12,601
- He doesn't have one.
- Where's your mum?

147
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:18,440
- She died.
- Well, who can believe this?

148
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:24,404
- I've been sad, but Dad's worse.
- Have you talked to him about it?

149
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:29,993
No, that makes him sadder.

150
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,871
Jonah, is your dad home?

151
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:37,709
- Is he busy?
- No, he's out on the deck.

152
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,046
Can't you ask him to talk to me?

153
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:47,094
- Wretched woman! Hang up, Jonah!
- No, he'd kill me.

154
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:52,099
He won't be angry when he hears
how concerned you are about him.

155
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:57,521
- Want to bet?
- If he yells, you lose a fan.

156
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:05,362
Dad, there's someone on the phone for you.

157
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,909
His name is Sam.

158
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:16,707
If you've just tuned in, tonight's
topic is wishes and dreams.

159
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,377
We have a listener from Seattle.

160
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:24,298
Sam, this is Dr. Fieldstone
on Network America.

161
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:29,720
What are you selling?
Micro-hibachis or knives?

162
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:35,058
Neither. I want to help.
Your son asked me for advice.

163
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:40,355
- He wants to find you a new wife.
- Who is this?

164
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:46,153
Dr. Fieldstone of Network America.
You are on the air.

165
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:50,657
- You called a radio station?
- Sam, are you there?

166
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:56,663
- Yes.
- You mourn your wife's death.

167
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:00,334
Your son is worried about you.

168
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:05,088
Get out here.
I won't go through this alone.

169
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:09,426
It's hard for him to talk to you about this.

170
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:14,348
If we talk about it,
maybe Jonah will feel better.

171
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:19,770
- Talk to her. She's a doctor.
- Her first name could be Doctor.

172
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:26,943
- Please.
- Sam, it's his Christmas wish.

173
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,821
- Okay.
- Good.

174
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:35,243
I know this is difficult.
When did your wife die?

175
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:41,833
- About a year and a half ago.
- Have you had any relationships?

176
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:47,047
- No.
- Why not?

177
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:52,886
- Marcia... or Dr. Fieldstone?
- Dr. Marcia.

178
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:59,226
- I don't mean to be rude...
- I don't want to pry...

179
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:06,775
- Sure you do.
- Go on, Sam. I'm listening.

180
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:12,197
We had a pretty tough time at first.

181
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:16,660
But we're dealing with it.

182
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:23,041
Jonah and I will get along fine,
as soon as I break his radio.

183
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,754
I'm sure you're a wonderful father.

184
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:31,842
- You can tell a lot from a voice.
- Yes, you can.

185
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:36,263
But Jonah still feels that you're under a cloud.

186
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:41,810
- Are you sleeping at night?
- He doesn't sleep at all.

187
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:46,231
- How do you know that?
- I live here, Dad.

188
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,778
Look, it's Christmas.

189
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:59,327
Maggie... my wife.

190
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,497
She really did it...

191
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:07,335
She loved...
She made everything beautiful.

192
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:13,300
It's tough this time of year.

193
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:20,724
- Every kid needs a mother.
- Maybe you need someone too.

194
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:27,647
- Yes.
- We'll resume after these messages.

195
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:34,362
Sam and Jonah, don't go away.
I'm talking to Sleepless in Seattle.

196
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,533
We'll be back with listener response.

197
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:45,165
- What's that?
- People call in and dump on you.

198
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:49,211
This is really fun. And helpful.

199
00:18:55,259 --> 00:19:01,056
- I bet he's tall with a cute butt.
- I bet he hasn't bathed in weeks.

200
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:04,267
- Yes?
- Tea, with the bag out.

201
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:11,608
- Maybe I'll just go up to Seattle.
- Don't open his refrigerator.

202
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:17,197
Men don't cover food, and they
leave it in there till it walks out.

203
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:22,702
I wouldn't kick him out of bed
for eating crackers. Sixty five cents.

204
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:29,584
We'll take a call before we talk to
Sleepless. Go ahead, Tennessee.

205
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:34,422
I'd like to have his address.

206
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,468
Honey, get in line.

207
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:44,933
- If I could ask you a question...
- Go ahead.

208
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:49,229
People who truly loved are likely to love again.

209
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:55,735
Sam, could you love anybody
as much as you loved your wife?

210
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:01,157
Well, that's hard to imagine.

211
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,452
What are you going to do?

212
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:11,835
Get out of bed every morning
and breathe in and out all day long.

213
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:20,176
And after a while I won't have to
remind myself to do it.

214
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:30,228
And then after a while I won't
remember how perfect things were.

215
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:34,691
Why was your wife so special?

216
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,320
How long is your program?

217
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:45,243
It was a million little things.

218
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:50,081
When you added them up, it meant
we were meant for each other.

219
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:54,628
I knew it the very first time I touched her.

220
00:20:54,795 --> 00:21:00,717
It was like coming home,
only to no home I'd ever known.

221
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:04,179
I was just taking her hand...

222
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:08,975
...to help her out of a car.
And I knew it.

223
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:14,814
- It was like... magic.
- Magic.

224
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:21,321
It's time to wrap it up.
I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone.

225
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:25,825
To all my listeners,
a magical and Merry Christmas.

226
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:33,249
And Sleepless in Seattle,
call and tell us how it's going.

227
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,000
You can count on it.

00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:34,352
- I feel strongly about this.
- Do it.

236
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,105
New Year's Eve. I won't write it.

237
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:41,526
Listen: "Phone service
was tied up Christmas Eve...

238
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:46,031
...when a kid called the radio
and said his dad needs a new wife."

239
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,909
Two thousand women wanted his number.

240
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:53,288
I heard it. This kid calls up...

241
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:59,544
...and the shrink forces
the father to talk about it.

242
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,839
Suddenly he starts talking...

243
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:09,429
...about how he fell in love with her
like these cows in Michigan.

244
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:15,101
The cows that got zapped by stray
voltage. Maybe it was Wisconsin.

245
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:21,733
Anyway, I was listening to him,
and suddenly I was crying.

246
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:25,070
Like when I see the ad...

247
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:30,200
...where the daughter gives her mum
the refrigerator with a red bow.

248
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:35,997
- Or the two kids at the party.
- Making an album for Grandfather!

249
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:39,751
That kills me!

250
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,630
Write about it. Whatever it is.

251
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:47,425
Two thousand women calling for a husband?

252
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,594
Women are desperate for love.

253
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:55,016
- Especially over a certain age.
- It's hard to get married over 40.

254
00:23:55,184 --> 00:24:00,063
- That statistic is not true.
- But it feels true.

255
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:05,652
- It's true.
- A new book proves it isn't true.

256
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,156
- Did you read that book?
- Did anybody read that book?

257
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:13,535
Are you done? Where were we?

258
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:20,625
If someone's a widower, why is he
widowed and not widowered?

259
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,171
Just wondering.

260
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:29,759
What was that about up there?
What's with you?

261
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:37,725
- Nothing.
- There's something. Tell me.

262
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,980
- Sleepless in Seattle?
- That's what she called him.

263
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:46,442
Now 2,000 women want his number.
He could be a crackhead...

264
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:54,200
...a transvestite, a junkie,
or really sick, like my Rick.

265
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:58,955
Actually, he sounded nice.

266
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:05,211
Really?
Now we're getting down to it.

267
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:10,675
I'm madly in love with Walter.
He did a crazy thing the other night.

268
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,558
It was so funny.
What was that?

269
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:33,239
I've got to go to Boston for the convention.

270
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:37,410
And I have to visit Winston-Hughes.

271
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:42,248
Why don't we meet in New York
for Valentine's Day weekend?

272
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:47,879
- Walter, I'd love to!
- We can stay at the Plaza.

273
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:54,844
- Ice skate in Central Park.
- Register.

274
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:59,933
You know... for dishes,
glasses, silver, everything.

275
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,063
How about it?

276
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:11,402
- We'll have dim sum in Chinatown.
- Is there wheat in it?

277
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,988
I don't think so.

278

The ball's dropping.

- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

283
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:35,320
- Kiss Howard.
- Goodnight, Howard.

Can I have half your beer?

304
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,461
Go ahead.

305
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:20,842
What did I use to say?
"Here's looking at you"?

306
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:25,138
- "Here's mud in your eye"?
- "Here's to us."

307
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:29,142
You used to say: "Here's to us."

308
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:37,358
Oh, babe.
I miss you so much it hurts.

309
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:59,046
You want to tell him? I'll tell him.

310
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,842
She's back with another idea.

311
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:08,890
Sam, I'm glad you're here. I heard
you on the radio. I told everyone.

312
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:13,936
- We already knew. From Grace.
- Then all of Seattle knows.

313
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:19,525
I was brushing my teeth and there
you were. I called my mother.

314
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:24,614
I said, "Turn on the radio.
That's my architect."

315
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:30,870
You know, it's so nice
when a man can express his feelings.

316
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:35,166
- I wish I could.
- Claire, is there a problem?

317
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:39,462
I couldn't sleep last night.
You know what that's like.

318
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:44,592
My platters won't fit in the refrigerator.

319
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:50,306
At parties I use platters, so I want
a Sub Zero refrigerator instead.

320
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:55,353
- We have to redo the cabinets.
- We'll be into this wall.

321
00:30:55,521 --> 00:31:00,691
- A bearing wall.
- That's a delay of five, six...

322
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:06,739
...12 weeks.
- It's important to get it right.

323
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:11,494
Well, la decorateur calls.
Bye.

324
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:20,169
It's fate. She's divorced, we don't
want to do this and you need a wife.

325
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:24,840
- Everything intersects.
- The Bermuda Triangle.

326
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:40,231
Here's one more. Do you have room?

327
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,819
- Dad, they're all for you.
- Here you go.

328
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:50,283
"Sleepless in Seattle."

329
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:55,204
If you can't sleep, try drinking
a glass of water from the other side.

330
00:31:55,372 --> 00:32:02,169
That's for hiccups. Or you can hold
a spoonful of sugar in your mouth.

331
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:05,381
Thank you.

332
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:11,554
- But why give them our address?
- They called and asked for it.

333
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:17,977
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are
the most attractive man I've heard."

334
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:22,940
They called?
You gave them our number too?

335
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:26,152
You have to, to get on the air.

336
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,072
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle.
I live in Tulsa." Where's that?

337
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,411
- In Oklahoma. Where is that?
- Somewhere in the middle.

338
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:40,791
I won't think about
what they don't teach you at school.

339
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:46,505
I think we should rule out
anyone who doesn't live near here.

340
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:50,718
She's willing to fly anywhere.

341
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:57,099
Looks like my third-grade teacher.
She is my third-grade teacher!

342
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:02,688
- Don't you want to read these?
- No, it's not how it's done.

343
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:07,109
I'd rather see somebody I like.

344
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:12,573
- Then I'd ask her out for a drink.
- Or a slice of pizza.

345
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:18,412
No dinner on the first date, because
halfway through you could regret it.

346
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:22,875
But if you like them after a drink,
you can always ask them to dinner.

347
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:27,171
If not, you can say,
"That was great," and go home.

348
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:32,510
You see? I wonder
if it still works this way.

349
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:36,889
- It doesn't. They ask you.
- I'm starting to notice that.

350
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:41,560
If you get a new wife,
you'll have sex with her, huh?

351
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:47,942
- I certainly hope so.
- Will she scratch up your back?

352
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:53,531
In movies women always scratch the
man's back and scream during sex.

353
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:57,410
- How do you know this?
- Jed's got cable.

354
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:04,208
Hand me that towel, please.

355
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:13,676
Thank you. Let me get you.
"Jed's got cable!"

Now to Dr. Fieldstone, psychologist
and the friend you never had.

372
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:51,524
- Remember Marooned in Miami?
- He doesn't love me anymore.

373
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:56,278
- Then why stay with him?
- Disappointed in Denver.

374
00:35:56,446 --> 00:36:00,699
When I come close to orgasm,
he goes to make a sandwich.

375
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:04,870
- Make a sandwich beforehand.
- Sleepless in Seattle.

376
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:13,295
I'll get up every morning
and breathe in and out all day long.

377
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:18,592
After a while I won't have to remind myself...

378
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:23,347
...to get up and breathe in and out.

379
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:30,187
Then after a while I won't
have to think about...

380
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:34,525
...how I had it great and perfect
for a while.

381
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:38,195
Why was your wife so special?

382
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:42,324
How long is your program?

383
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:49,874
It was a million little things.

384
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:54,670
When you added them up, it meant
we were meant for each other.

385
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:59,550
I knew it, the first time I touched her.

386
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:05,139
It was like coming home,
only to no home I'd ever known.

387
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:11,520
I was just taking her hand
to help her out of a car.

388
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:16,901
And I knew it.
It was like...

389
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,696
...magic.

390
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:44,803
I think I'm going crazy, Dennis.
Are you happily married?

391
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:49,808
Why did you get married?
Was it trumpets and fireworks?

392
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:54,855
Betsy said we had to break up
or get married. That's why.

393
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:59,902
When you met, did you think
she was the only one for you?

394
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,197
That in some way it was fated?

395
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:07,159
Annie, attraction is...

396
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:12,373
...when your subconscious is
attracted to their subconscious.

397
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:17,711
Fate is two neuroses
knowing they're a perfect match.

398
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:24,009
I'm having all these fantasies
about a man I never even met!

399
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:28,305
- And he lives in Seattle!
- It rains nine months a year there.

400
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:33,477
I know. I won't move to Seattle.

401
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:42,653
But I don't want to end up wondering
what might have happened.

402
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:47,574
What do you think?
It's cold feet, isn't it?

403
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:52,246
- Everybody panics. Didn't you?
- Yes, I did.

404
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:58,168
Thanks, Dennis. I feel better now.

405
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:04,216
Sandy's friend is a weightlifter,
but her neck isn't that big.

406
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:11,473
No, don't set me up. I want to know
what it's like out there.

407
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:16,729
Women are looking for pecs and a cute butt.

408
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:21,108
"He has the cutest butt."
Where did I hear that recently?

409
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:28,032
Everywhere. Even on the news
women talk about cute butts.

410
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,660
It's really caught on.

411
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:35,372
So how's my butt?

412
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,835
- Not bad.
- Is it cute though?

413
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,421
Are we grading on a curve?

414
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:48,010
When was your last date?

415
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:53,307
Jimmy Carter... 1978.

416
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:59,229
Things are different now.
First you have to be friends.

417
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:03,233
Then you neck.
This could go on for years.

418
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:07,946
Then you have tests and do it with a
condom. But you do split the check.

419
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:13,952
- I can't let a woman pay.
- They'll throw a parade for you.

420
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:18,290
You'll be Man of the Year.

421
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:23,504
Tira misu.
You'll find out what that is.

422
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:28,092
Some woman will want me to do it
to her, and I won't know what it is.

423
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:35,390
- You'll love it.
- This is going to be tough.

424
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:42,022
What about that decorator?
She's perky.

425
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:48,695
No. I'm far away from that.
I'm just making notes.

426
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:54,034
- How would I do it?
- Ask her over to look at swatches.

427
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:59,123
- To look at swatches?
- Yeah, color schemes.

428
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:05,087
Don't do it like I did. Be suave.
Think Cary Grant.

429
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:09,508
Would he say, "Come look at my swatches"?

430
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:14,638
- Not it in movies...
- Not in Gunga Din?

431
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:19,351
Gunga Din isn't that kind of film.
Who knows what he did in real life.

432
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:24,857
- He did that with Dyan Cannon?
- "Dyan, look at these swatches."

433
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,044
Jonah, I'm home!

434
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,258
Jonah?

435
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:59,516
Jonah.

436
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:12,571
Hi, Dad. This is Jessica.

437
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:16,074
Nice to meet you.

438
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:21,205
This is amazing. If you play this
backwards, it says "Paul is dead."

439
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:26,919
- Yeah, I know.
- How do you know?

440
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:32,591
- Dad, could you shut the door?
- Sure.

441
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:38,513
H and G.
Hi and goodbye.

Hello, Victoria?

452
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:59,845
This is Sam Baldwin.
I don't know if you remember me...

453
00:44:00,013 --> 00:44:03,974
Oh, great.

454
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:10,981
I was wondering if you would like
to have a drink with me?

455
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:13,608
Dinner?

456
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:17,446
Dinner would be even better.

457
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:21,074
Friday would be great.

458
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:24,953
I hear that's a good place.

459
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:30,792
Seven-thirty is fine. And I'll...

460
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:36,882
Okay, I'll meet you there.

461
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:43,513
So it's Friday
at 7:30 for dinner. Great.

462
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:47,043
Me too. Bye.

463
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:50,228
♪ <i>Back in the saddle again</i> ♪

464
00:44:53,983 --> 00:45:00,405
- Are you in love with him?
- Not now.

465
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:06,495
- Those people knew how to love.
- You're a basket case.

466
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:12,918
They knew it. Nothing could
separate them because they knew.

467
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:16,671
- It was real.
- It's a movie.

468
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:22,511
You don't want to be in love,
you want to be in a movie. Read it.

469
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:27,974
"Dear Sleepless and Son. I've never
written a letter like this before."

470
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:33,814
- That's what everyone writes.
- You think I don't know that?

471
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:37,609
What about Walter?

472
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:41,780
I'd give anything to marry Walter.

473
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:48,161
He's so unexpected. You think
you know him, but you don't.

474
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:52,082
I should write about magic.

475
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:57,087
What if this man is my destiny,
and I never meet him?

476
00:45:57,255 --> 00:46:01,967
- Your destiny can be your doom.
- "I want to meet you"...

477
00:46:02,135 --> 00:46:07,055
- On the Empire State Building.
- On the Empire State Building.

478
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:10,767
Sunset, Valentine's Day.

479
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:15,063
I'll be in New York with Walter.
I can squeeze it in.

480
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:19,025
I'll be in New York with Walter!

481
00:46:25,158 --> 00:46:30,996
Because of fate I married Martin and
bought the house with the dead tree.

482
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:35,417
On account of which I got divorced
and hit a car...

483
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:39,004
...and met Rick,
while buying a neck brace.

484
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:42,799
You got divorced because of a tree?

485
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:46,386
- The tree man.
- You fell in love with him?

486
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:52,601
I did not say love.
This is my favorite part.

487
00:46:53,728 --> 00:47:00,066
- It's now or never.
- Never is a frightening word.

488
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:04,779
We'd be fools to let happiness pass us by.

489
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:11,119
Winter must be cold
for those with no warm memories.

490
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:16,458
We've already missed the spring.

491
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:22,589
- Men never get this movie.
- I know.

492
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:26,343
Mummy! Mummy!

493
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:35,352
- Mummy!
- It's okay. I'm here. I'm coming.

494
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:41,525
It's okay. What was that about?

495
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:47,197
Our house was sinking. There was
water coming in all the windows.

496
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:53,537
Well, it's okay now.

497
00:47:54,664 --> 00:48:00,877
What shall we do? Your mother sang
to you when you had bad dreams.

498
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:05,590
"Bye Bye Blackbird."

499
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:12,222
I miss her. What happens
to someone after they die?

500
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:18,645
- I don't know.
- Do you believe in heaven?

501
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:27,696
I never believed in an afterlife.
But now, I don't know.

502
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:34,786
Because I've had these dreams about your mum.

503
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:41,001
We have long talks... about you.

504
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:47,465
How you're doing. She sort of
knows, but I tell her anyway.

505
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:54,097
So what is that?
It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?

506
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:58,310
I'm starting to forget her.

507
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:18,038
She could peel an apple...

508
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:21,460
...in one long, curly strip.

509

Laurie? It's Annie.

532
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:19,033
I'm writing about radio shows.
Do you know Dr. Fieldstone?

533
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:25,039
I work for the Baltimore Sun, and
I'm doing a piece on bereavement.

534
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:29,169
I understand you had a caller from Seattle.

535
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:42,474
This is Jonah Baldwin.
We're not in right now...

536
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,538
Architect.

537
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:27,120
I'll be back either by midnight
or 8:30, if disaster strikes.

538
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:31,708
- Here's one for both of us.
- "Sleepless and Son, Baltimore."

539
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:35,420
Here's the doctor's number.

540
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:40,675
Here's a bottle of Ipecac
if anybody drinks poison.

541
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:45,763
How do I look?
Do I look all right?

542
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:51,436
I look stupid. I'm trying too hard.
I was going to get a haircut.

543
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:56,399
- This is a good letter, Dad.
- These heels are grotesque.

544
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:59,611
Her name is Annie Reed.

545
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:03,323
Dad, read this.

546
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:09,037
"Dear Sleepless and Son...

547
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:13,833
I'm an excellent third baseman,
and let me tell you...

548
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:18,838
...Robinson was the best. We must
agree on this. I'm from Baltimore."

549
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:24,260
She likes Brooks Robinson.
So do you. It's a sign.

550
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:29,057
Come here. I'll show you a sign.

551
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:38,066
Where's Seattle?
And Baltimore? Right there!

552
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:43,488
There's like 26 states between
here and there. That's a sign.

553
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:48,701
I'm out of here. Goodbye.
I love you.

554
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:56,167
Clarise, did you move your car?

555
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:08,805
- Thanks, Derrick. I'll have...
- White wine spritzer?

556
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:12,392
- And you, sir?
- I'm fine.

557
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:17,563
- You look good.
- So do you.

558
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:23,903
I thought you'd never call me.

559
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:27,365
I really wanted you to.

560
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:33,413
Mr. Baldwin, phone call for you.

561
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:45,341
Dad, can we go to New York for Valentine's Day?

562
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:51,514
Annie Reed wants to meet us at the
top of the Empire State Building.

563
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:58,688
Jonah, have you fallen down?
Has Clarise been strangled?

564
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:01,941
- No.
- Is that the reason you're calling?

565
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:07,447
We can get cheap tickets from Jessica's parents.

566
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:11,868
We'll talk about it later.

567
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:17,206
This conversation has lasted
too long. Go to bed.

568
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:27,216
- Everything all right?
- Yes. Do you have kids?

569
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:30,595
You want mine?

570
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:35,725
I'll have an Absolut straight up.

571
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:56,037
Put that down. Stop it!

572
00:56:56,205 --> 00:57:00,333
- There she is.
- Why is she bringing groceries?

573
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:05,588
- She's going to cook for us.
- Hi, Sam.

574
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:09,801
Let me guess. You must be Jonah.

575
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:17,141
This is it? The car is this way.

576
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:24,232
She's on her sixth painter. And now
she wants the fireplace rebricked.

577
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:30,947
- I know her. I could call her.
- I'll just hit her with a brick.

578
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,494
That's so funny. You're so funny.

579
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:42,708
When she wants something done
she says: "You know best.

580
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:48,131
But couldn't we flip the house
so the back is in front?

581
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:54,387
Put the front on a hinge so I can
get in with a garage door opener."

582
00:57:54,555 --> 00:58:00,852
- "Yes, we can. We'll just..."
- "Move the cabinets."

583
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:11,779
Jonah, bring some of that stuff.

584
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:14,991
Do you like baseball?

585
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:20,079
Yes. In fact my firm has box seats
to the Mariners. Let's go some day.

586
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:26,627
What about camping?
Do you like that?

587
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:29,589
I went camping once.

588
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:35,511
- We should go camping more often.
- You're right. Time for bed.

589
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:40,266
- It's only 10:00.
- That's right. Time for bed.

590
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:43,436
Goodnight.

591
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:49,066
Thank Victoria for the nice dinner.

592
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:54,322
Thanks for dinner. I never saw
anybody cook potatoes that way.

593
00:58:54,489 --> 00:59:00,244
I'm glad you liked it.
Goodnight, Jonah.

594
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:07,501
We don't see a lot of potatoes here.
We're rice men.

595
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:04,267
I'm sorry, Walter. I'm sorry.

596
01:00:08,981 --> 01:00:11,607
Turn on your radio.

597
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:16,779
The kid is on. You've got me
listening to this garbage!

598
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:24,787
Becky's having trouble with Rick.
Becky, I'll call you back.

599
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:32,128
I'm sorry, Walter.
Are you bleeding?

600
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:54,483
He's kissing her right now!

601
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:58,446
Are you spying on your father?

602
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:03,659
- Who is he kissing?
- I have to make them stop.

603
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:07,955
- How will I explain this to Walter?
- She made dinner.

604
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:11,334
She brought food for a whole year!

605
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:16,005
It's good that your father's dating.
It's just hard on you.

606
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:20,551
You think you want it,
but when it happens, it scares you.

607
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:26,182
Shouldn't your father decide
whether someone is right for him?

608
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,642
He's not sane enough.

609
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:34,690
He's kissing her on the lips.
My dad's been captured by a 'ho!

610
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:39,570
Calm down. Tomorrow,
when you're having breakfast...

611
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:45,618
...tell him how you feel.
Don't keep it inside.

612
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:54,752
Miss Scarlett. In the broom closet.
With the radio.

613
01:01:54,920 --> 01:02:00,466
Walter, you scared me.
Don't ever do that again.

614
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:08,099
- I saw a black widow.
- You scared me and Victoria.

615
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:13,229
- It was right there.
- Next time I want you to say:

616
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:17,691
"Dad, I see a poisonous insect."

617
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:21,320
And I'll deal with it. Don't scream.

618
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:25,991
Becky thought Rick was on the radio.

619
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:32,081
It turned out the guy lived
in Duluth. Where's Duluth?

620
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:36,710
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I know. No sense at all.

621
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:42,591
- Thank God my life is in place.
- Duluth? That's in North Dakota.

622
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:01,861
- Great letter. Write to her.
- You think so?

623
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:07,533
It's Y-O-H.
Your only hope.

624
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:24,675
I thought I'd do a story on those radio shows.

625
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:29,472
- You'd have to go somewhere.
- Definitely.

626
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:52,745
- Can't you do a phone interview?
- No.

627
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:57,208
- I won't be in Chicago long.
- When you get back, I'll be gone.

628
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:01,504
- Then I'll see you in New York.
- I'll get it.

629
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:10,763
This is Captain Browning.
We're cruising at 35,000 feet.

630
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:16,393
The weather is clear
and we'll be in Seattle on schedule.

631
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:24,443
- Don't you hate flying?
- Yes, and I've told a terrible lie.

632
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:27,905
Is any lie a betrayal?

633
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:31,909
I said flying.

634
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:42,670
- Thanks for bringing me here.
- He likes the planes.

635
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:49,635
Can I bring you back a souvenir?
Maybe one of these snow globes?

636
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:54,640
Sure, I'd really like that.
Thank you so much.

637
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:59,687
- He's eight.
- He's good at it.

638
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:04,900
I've read an article about it.
Children are hideous at that age.

639
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:12,032
Maybe when I come back, the two of
us ought to spend some time alone.

640
01:05:16,538 --> 01:05:19,665
Bye. Bye, Jonah.

641
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,131
Jonah.

642
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:30,801
Listen, you don't know Victoria.

643
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:36,098
In fact she's a mystery to me too.

644
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:40,311
She tosses her hair a lot. Why?

645
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:45,482
Is it a twitch? Does she need
a haircut or a barrette?

646
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:54,533
I'd like to understand these things.
And that's why I'm dating her.

647
01:05:54,701 --> 01:06:00,080
Just dating. I'm not living
with her. I'm not marrying her.

648
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:03,792
Can you appreciate the difference?

649
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:08,589
That's what single people do.
They see how other people fit.

650
01:06:08,757 --> 01:06:15,346
Everyone's an adjustment.
There's no such thing as a perfect...

651
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:33,030
Come on.

652
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:41,413
Dad, Jessica says
you knew Annie in another life.

653
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:46,377
The one who wrote us. But you
never got together in that life.

654
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:52,466
Your hearts will be a complete
puzzle once you're together.

655
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:59,473
I know that because I'm young and
pure, in touch with cosmic forces.

656
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:05,187
Who told you that? I sure hope
you're not marrying Jessica.

657

- I watched them play at the beach.
- Did you talk to him?

684
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:57,442
Couldn't do it.

685
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:03,323
- How did I get here?
- You lied and got on a plane.

686
01:10:04,576 --> 01:10:11,915
- I'm going to talk to him tomorrow.
- Okay. Good. Goodbye.

687
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:15,502
Beck.

688
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:22,009
- Is this crazy?
- No, that's the weirdest part.

689
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:28,307
- Thank you. I love you.
- I love you too.

690
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:34,998
It's good to see you. Where's Greg?

691
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:02,275
Hello.

692
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:13,036
- Then what?
- I left, obviously.

693
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:18,959
- You were in the street?
- It was like walking around naked.

694
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:24,798
- I love that dream.
- This was more humiliating.

695
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:29,011
But he saw you.
You were face to face.

696
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:36,018
He said hello.
And all I could say was hello.

697
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:42,524
- All I could say was hello.
- It's a sign.

698
01:12:42,692 --> 01:12:47,821
It's a sign that I've watched
this movie too many times.

699
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:54,619
From the minute I heard that program
I've been a complete jerk.

700
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:58,665
- You're not a jerk.
- Thank you. An idiot!

701
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:04,588
- You don't know who she was.
- I have a picture of her.

702
01:13:04,756 --> 01:13:11,094
The detective sent it to me.
See, that's what she looks like.

703
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:17,100
- It's her back.
- It's her and he's crazy about her.

704
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:22,189
What's this?
It's from Seattle.

705
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,948
Becky.

706
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:36,495
So I mailed your letter.

707
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:43,251
"Dear Annie. Thanks for your letter.
You sound neat.

708
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:52,886
We're excited about meeting you
in New York and seeing if we are...

709
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:56,348
...M-F-E-O.

710
01:13:56,516 --> 01:14:00,727
See you soon.
Sleepless in Seattle."

711
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:03,688
M-F-E-O?

712
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:10,362
Made for each other.

713
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:13,698
It's cute. Like a little clue.

714
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:21,665
So he can't write. Big deal.

715
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:27,504
Verbal ability is overrated in guys.
Our need for it leads to trouble.

716
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:32,717
- I'm going to run back to Walter.
- And the letter?

717
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:37,681
It was written before I went
out there. Before the 'ho.

718
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:47,315
But she didn't look like a 'ho.
She looked like one of our friends.

719
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:56,825
- You saw her in the airport too?
- It was like I knew her.

720
01:14:56,993 --> 01:15:02,414
- Like a déjà-vu?
- It was very déjà-vu-ish.

721
01:15:02,582 --> 01:15:08,253
- At least you're seeing people.
- Well, only one.

722
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:12,549
- Victoria.
- You don't like her?

723
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:18,013
- She laughs like a hyena.
- Is this true?

724
01:15:18,181 --> 01:15:22,350
Sort of. Tell them what you did.

725
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:25,770
Tell them about the radio show.

726
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:29,691
Christmas Eve he calls a radio show.

727
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:36,740
- And tells them I need a new wife.
- That's so sweet.

728
01:15:36,908 --> 01:15:40,994
Now he's obsessed with a woman who wrote me.

729
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:43,747
She wants to meet me on top of Empire State.

730
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:46,374
On Valentines Day.

731
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:52,172
It's like that movie.
An Affair to Remember.

732
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:57,427
Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.
Is that "car" or "cur"?

733
01:16:00,765 --> 01:16:06,519
They were to meet at the Empire
State, but she got hit by a taxi.

734
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:11,566
He waited and waited.
And it was raining.

735
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:18,198
Then she's too proud to tell him that she's...

736
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:26,456
...crippled. And he's too proud
to find out why she doesn't come.

737
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:30,502
But he comes to see her anyway.

738
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:35,382
It's amazing when he visits her.

739
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:40,262
He doesn't notice that she
doesn't get up to say hello.

740
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:43,682
And he's very bitter.

741
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:48,728
You think he's going to walk out
and never know why.

742
01:16:48,896 --> 01:16:57,112
She's just lying there with
a blanket over her shrivelled legs.

743
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:02,409
- Are you all right?
- She's fine.

744
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:09,040
Then he says, "I saw the painting,"
and goes into the bedroom.

745
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:13,169
And he comes out and looks at her.

746
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:17,841
And they just know and hug and it's so...

747
01:17:18,009 --> 01:17:21,636
- That's a chick's movie.
- I'd say so.

748
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:27,684
- Who'd write a guy from the radio?
- I got hundreds of letters.

749
01:17:27,852 --> 01:17:32,564
- Desperate women.
- Is wanting a nice guy desperate?

750
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:38,194
It's easier to be killed
by terrorists than to marry over 40.

751
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:42,782
- That is not true!
- Right, honey.

752
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:48,413
I don't want a mail-order bride.
Just someone who can converse...

753
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:54,419
...without falling into
weepy tears over an old movie.

754
01:17:54,587 --> 01:18:00,633
I cried over The Dirty Dozen.
Jim Brown throwing the grenades.

755
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:06,431
Richard Jaeckel and Lee Marvin
on top of a tank dressed like Nazis.

756
01:18:08,142 --> 01:18:15,148
Trini Lopez... breaks his neck
when they're parachuting.

757
01:18:15,316 --> 01:18:20,153
Richard Jaeckel had on a shiny
helmet, because he was an MP.

758
01:18:20,321 --> 01:18:25,075
Please, no more.
God, I love that movie.

759
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:38,171
- This is the best movie I ever saw.
- What's so great about it?

760
01:18:38,339 --> 01:18:43,009
- You have to find her.
- How much would it cost to go?

761
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:47,847
Nobody knows.
It changes practically every day.

762
01:18:48,015 --> 01:18:51,309
- How much money do you have?
- 80 dollars.

763
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:57,482
- I have 42. That'll cover cabs.
- How would I get there?

764
01:18:57,650 --> 01:19:03,405
I have to drop these tickets off.
Can you keep an eye on things?

765
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:17,043
- Window seat or aisle?
- Window.

766
01:19:17,211 --> 01:19:22,006
You want a fruit plate?
I'd rather die than eat airplane food.

767
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:26,469
I'll write you're 12.
That way you can fly unaccompanied.

768
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:33,226
- Who'd believe I'm 12?
- They'll believe the computer.

769
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:38,857
I'll say you're short for your age,
but that they shouldn't mention it.

770
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:41,276
Great idea!

771

786
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:11,699
I was going to say that since Christmas...

787
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:15,828
...you've been kind of distracted.

788
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:22,293
But now it feels as if you're coming
back from wherever you were.

789
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:25,755
I am.

790
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:31,970
I was just...
I think I got nervous.

791
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:39,561
But that's normal, right?
Don't you ever feel nervous...

792
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:45,692
- About what?
- Forever.

793
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,944
No.

794
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:55,994
Well... I did.

795
01:21:56,161 --> 01:22:01,457
And I think I thought it was too perfect.

796
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:07,338
I was afraid we'd be two rights making a wrong.

797
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:14,304
You know, it was like kismet,
but not, if you see what I mean.

798
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:19,475
You have to grow up and forget
the adolescent fantasies about...

799
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:24,188
...how exciting life will be.
I'm sorry, but I love this pattern.

800
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:29,110
You couldn't. This is just
like my grandmother's china.

801
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:33,781
- How many place settings?
- Ten.

802
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:42,540
Exactly. Eight is too few,
twelve is too many.

803
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:09,984
- Walter.
- It was my mother's.

804
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:16,699
I had them size it down.
She had really fat fingers.

805
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:23,414
It's so beautiful.
It's exactly what I'd pick...

806
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:28,836
...if I had every ring
in the world to choose from.

807
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:34,634
Some people want a relationship
to be full of surprises...

808
01:23:34,802 --> 01:23:39,055
...but I'm not one of them.

809
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:44,268
Surprises are highly overrated.

810
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:50,108
I'll only be gone one night.
Clarise will be here.

811
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:54,237
You can watch scary movies.

812
01:23:54,405 --> 01:23:59,325
- Are you going with her?
- I'm going with Victoria.

813
01:24:01,662 --> 01:24:05,289
Don't try anything tricky.

814
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:14,048
Don't roll in poison ivy
or do anything so you need stitches.

815
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:21,055
If your finger falls off, it stays
off. I won't take you to hospital.

816
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:26,144
- Is this about that woman?
- Annie.

817
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:34,026
- I don't care what you do!
- I'll tell you what I'm doing.

818
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:40,199
I'm getting laid. I'm the only man
in the 90s who's getting laid.

819
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:45,955
And I haven't been laid that much.
Six or seven girls at college.

820
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:50,126
How long have you been there?
What did you hear me say?

821
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:55,757
- "Six or seven girls at college."
- Seven. Eight! Mary Kelly.

822
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:58,926
This is the one I like.

823
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:05,099
Jonah, you won't like any woman,
because it isn't your mother.

824
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:10,563
- What's wrong with Annie?
- Jonah, shut up.

825
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:16,736
Shut up? Mum never told me
to shut up or yelled at me.

826
01:25:16,904 --> 01:25:19,822
This conversation is over!

827
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:26,579
This woman could be a sick lunatic.
Didn't you see Fatal Attraction?

828
01:25:26,747 --> 01:25:32,543
- You wouldn't let me.
- It scared every man in America.

829
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:38,674
I'm not leaving till you say yes.

830
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:44,889
I hate you!

831
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:49,018
Good, then you can tell Oprah
how your dad ruined your life...

832
01:25:49,186 --> 01:25:53,356
...by going off for a weekend
special at the Holiday Inn!

833
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:13,042
Jonah, Clarise is here and I've got to go.

834
01:26:21,969 --> 01:26:27,807
Jonah, listen, I've got to go.

835
01:26:55,043 --> 01:27:01,048
Jessica, tell us where he is.
Jonah's dad is very upset.

836
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:06,637
Jessica, this is your father.
Tell us where he is.

837
01:27:08,515 --> 01:27:11,851
- N-Y.
- That means "no way."

838
01:27:12,019 --> 01:27:14,896
That's N-W!

839
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:20,276
- He's on his way to New York.
- How?

840
01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:23,487
United, 597.

841
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:27,325
- When does it leave?
- Seven thirty.

842
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:37,710
Here's a pin for flying with us.

843
01:27:37,878 --> 01:27:41,672
- Can I take this for you?
- No.

844
01:27:56,021 --> 01:28:00,024
- Where to, kid?
- Empire State Building.

845
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:04,528
- Empire State Building.
- Don't stop so close to the curb.

846
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:11,744
There it is. What are you going
to do up there? Spit off the top?

847
01:28:11,912 --> 01:28:15,122
No, I'm meeting my new mother.

848
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:41,232
- I'm Jonah. Are you Annie?
- No, I'm Cynthia.

849
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:51,784
Excuse me, are you Annie?

850
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:31,741
Great table. Thanks.

851
01:29:32,951 --> 01:29:35,828
Is something wrong?

852
01:29:35,996 --> 01:29:40,041
- Can I get you a drink?
- Champagne?

853
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,793
Fine.

854
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:47,173
We'll have a bottle of Dom DeLuise.

855
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:54,555
- Just kidding.
- He meant Dom Perignon.

856
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:59,935
Beautiful view.

857
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:04,648
Walter.
There's something I must tell you.

858
01:30:19,289 --> 01:30:22,583
Sorry, an emergency.

859
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:26,879
Money, money, money, see?

860
01:31:42,289 --> 01:31:47,251
So he could be on top of
the Empire State Building now?

861
01:31:47,419 --> 01:31:53,132
No. I guess he could be. No.

862
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:59,763
It's not him, Walter. It's me.
I can't do this.

863
01:32:01,558 --> 01:32:08,355
Annie, I love you.
But let's leave that out of this.

864
01:32:09,316 --> 01:32:16,113
I don't want to be someone that you
or anybody else settles for.

865
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:23,579
Marriage is hard enough
without such low expectations.

866
01:32:23,747 --> 01:32:28,292
- Isn't it?
- Walter, I don't deserve you.

867
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:33,005
No, I wouldn't put it that way.

868
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:37,218
But okay.

869
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:55,611
- You okay?
- Yeah.

870
01:33:00,867 --> 01:33:04,119
- What?
- Look.

871
01:33:11,628 --> 01:33:14,672
- It's a sign.
- Who needed a sign?

872
01:33:14,881 --> 01:33:19,760
Walter, I have to go.

873
01:33:32,816 --> 01:33:35,985
Jonah!

874
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:41,657
Dad!

875
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:59,049
What if something happened to you?
What if I couldn't get to you?

876
01:33:59,217 --> 01:34:03,554
I'm sorry.

877
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:09,601
What would I have done?
You're my family. You're all I have.

878
01:34:09,769 --> 01:34:12,396
I thought she'd be here.

879
01:34:12,564 --> 01:34:17,735
We're doing okay, right?
So far, have I done anything stupid?

880
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:22,906
- Have I screwed it up for us?
- No.

881
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:18,712
- Observation deck?
- Sorry, it's too late.

882
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:24,426
- Please. I need to get up there.
- We're closing up.

883
01:35:29,182 --> 01:35:35,187
Can I just take a look?
I'm supposed to meet someone.

884
01:35:35,355 --> 01:35:40,359
He's probably not there, but if
I don't look, I'll always wonder.

885
01:35:40,527 --> 01:35:44,738
- Cary Grant, right?
- You know that movie?

886
01:35:44,906 --> 01:35:47,241
It's one of my wife's favorites.

887
01:35:55,792 --> 01:36:00,379
Maybe when we get home we'll get a dog.

888
01:36:00,547 --> 01:36:06,343
- Wouldn't you like to have a dog?
- Sure.

889
01:36:18,231 --> 01:36:22,526
I'm sorry, ma'am. Empty.

890
01:36:23,445 --> 01:36:28,866
- Can I take a minute?

It's you.
I saw you in the street.

893
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:20,936
- Are you Annie?
- Yes.

894

You're Annie?

895
01:38:28,278 --> 01:38:32,447
- This must be yours.
- I'm Jonah.

896
01:38:32,615 --> 01:38:37,536
- This is my dad. His name is Sam.
- Hi, Jonah.

01:38:38,538 --> 01:38:41,415
Sam.

898
01:38:44,586 --> 01:38:49,631
- And who's this?
- Howard.

899
01:39:05,064 --> 01:39:08,692
We'd better go.
