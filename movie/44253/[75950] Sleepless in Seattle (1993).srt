1
00:00:41,383 --> 00:00:45,979
Mummy got sick.
It happened just like that.

2
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:50,180
Nobody could stop it.

3
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:53,972
It isn't fair.
There's no reason.

4
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:59,615
And if we start asking why,
we'll go crazy.

5
00:01:21,063 --> 00:01:25,773
Five minutes in the microwave.
Any one of them.

6
00:01:27,623 --> 00:01:30,854
Do you know how to make juice?

7
00:01:33,263 --> 00:01:37,097
Microwave. Five minutes.

8
00:01:52,263 --> 00:01:56,575
Here. It's my shrink.
Call him.

9
00:02:05,263 --> 00:02:09,256
Loss of Spouse Support Group.

10
00:02:09,423 --> 00:02:14,656
Chicago Cancer Family Network.
Parents without Partners.

11
00:02:14,823 --> 00:02:19,021
"Hug Yourself",
"Hug a Friend", "Hug a Shrink" ...

12
00:02:19,183 --> 00:02:24,860
Work hard, that'll save you.
Only work will see you through this.

13
00:02:29,703 --> 00:02:34,697
Don't mind him.
he's just a guy who's lost his wife.

14
00:02:38,623 --> 00:02:42,696
What I think we really need is ...
change.

15
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:48,062
Good idea. Take a few weeks off.
take Jonah fishing.

16
00:02:49,783 --> 00:02:54,015
No, real change.
A new city.

17
00:02:55,023 --> 00:02:59,858
Some place where I don't think
of Maggie at every corner.

18
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:10,539
Where are you gonna go?

19
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,541
I was thinking about Seattle.

20
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:21,133
In a few months, you'll be seeing
women. You'll meet someone.

21
00:03:21,303 --> 00:03:28,141
Move on. fine. that's what I'll do.
I'll just grow a new heart.

22
00:03:28,303 --> 00:03:33,980
- Sam, I'm sorry, I didn't mean ...
- I know. But it can't happen twice.

23
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:24,018
- The tall redhead is cousin Irene.
- You'll see her disappointed look.

24
00:05:24,183 --> 00:05:30,702
- Harold ran off with the secretary.
- Until Irene had the dog put down.

25
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:35,493
Your brother Dennis
is professor at Johns Hopkins.

26
00:05:35,663 --> 00:05:41,056
- He's married to ... Betsy.
- The most competitive woman ever.

27
00:05:41,223 --> 00:05:45,535
- How will I remember all this?
- Walter, you will!

28
00:05:57,143 --> 00:06:01,455
- Uncle Milton lost all his money.
- And some other people's.

29
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:06,014
... in a pyramid scheme. Don't
mention the IRS or the prisons.

30
00:06:06,183 --> 00:06:09,414
Your mother's Barbara.
your father's Cliff ...

31
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:13,292
- He has electric trains.
- Really?

32
00:06:13,463 --> 00:06:20,494
- Am I what they had in mind?
- Walter, they're gonna love you!

33
00:06:22,903 --> 00:06:27,772
Everybody ...
Annie has an announcement.

34
00:06:27,943 --> 00:06:31,538
Walter and I are engaged.

35
00:06:48,703 --> 00:06:50,739
Bless you!

36
00:06:52,303 --> 00:06:57,138
- Are you all right?
- Maybe it's the flowers.

37
00:06:57,303 --> 00:07:01,455
- We'll move them.
- No! I feel terrible, sneezing now.

38
00:07:01,623 --> 00:07:06,492
- This is a very important moment.
- He's just allergic to everything.

39
00:07:06,663 --> 00:07:10,019
Bees.
I'm allergic to bees.

40
00:07:10,183 --> 00:07:15,701
He's allergic to all bees. We
have to take adrenalin with us.

41
00:07:15,863 --> 00:07:22,052
- If he eats just a bit of a nut ...
- My head swells, and I drop dead.

42
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:26,262
- It's the same with him and bees.
- We had salmon at our wedding ...

43
00:07:26,423 --> 00:07:31,975
- A wedding without salmon is ...
- I'm not allergic to salmon.

44
00:07:32,143 --> 00:07:34,532
But you never know.

45
00:07:34,703 --> 00:07:38,662
- You never know.
- He wasn't always allergic to bees.

46
00:07:38,823 --> 00:07:45,820
- What did we do with our champagne?
- Uncle Milton's parole.

47
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:51,011
- When are you getting married?
- Early June, in the garden.

48
00:07:51,183 --> 00:07:57,895
- What about Harold and bees?
- I'm allergic to bees.

49
00:07:58,063 --> 00:08:01,612
Cold salmon. cucumber salad.
strawberries ...

50
00:08:01,783 --> 00:08:06,732
I'm afraid I am allergic
to strawberries.

51
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:10,855
Is this all right with you?

52
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:16,620
I'm the luckiest man-man-man on
the face of the earth-earth-earth.

53
00:08:16,783 --> 00:08:22,574
- That's Lou Gehrig's line from ...
- "Pride of the Yankees".

54
00:08:22,743 --> 00:08:27,294
- "Pride of the Yankees"!
- Baseball. An historical reference.

55
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:32,014
I would like to propose a toast.
To my kid sister!

56
00:08:32,183 --> 00:08:35,971
To Walter and my baby.

57
00:08:39,223 --> 00:08:42,898
Please eat, before it gets cold.

58
00:08:45,383 --> 00:08:51,094
Here it is. I wouldn't
give it to the Historical Society.

59
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:55,814
- Oh. Mum ...
- These things are back in fashion.

60
00:08:55,983 --> 00:08:59,020
Grandmother's dress.

61
00:09:00,143 --> 00:09:05,854
- He's a lovely man, Annie.
- He is. isn't he?

62
00:09:06,103 --> 00:09:12,417
And he's a wonderful athlete. We're
going to DC to see his parents.

63
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:16,542
- How did it happen?
- It's silly, really.

64
00:09:16,703 --> 00:09:21,652
I'd seen him at the office.
He's the associate publisher.

65
00:09:21,823 --> 00:09:25,338
We had both ordered sandwiches. -

66
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:29,496
- and he got my tomato on wheat,
which he's allergic to, -

67
00:09:29,663 --> 00:09:33,941
- and I got his tomato on white.
Amazing, isn't it?

68
00:09:34,103 --> 00:09:38,893
You make a million decisions.
and a sandwich changes your life.

69
00:09:39,063 --> 00:09:41,702
Destiny takes a hand.

70
00:09:41,863 --> 00:09:47,335
We invented destiny, because we
don't want things to be accidental.

71
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:52,418
Then why did you order the same
sandwich except for the bread?

72
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:59,261
How many people like tomato
without something else, like tuna?

73
00:09:59,463 --> 00:10:03,172
It wasn't a sign.
It was a coincidence.

74
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:07,461
I was in Atlantic City,
where Cliff was a waiter.

75
00:10:07,623 --> 00:10:11,901
He wasn't supposed to work
that night. What if he hadn't?

76
00:10:12,063 --> 00:10:19,572
He asked me to take a midnight walk.
I told you this a million times.

77
00:10:19,743 --> 00:10:27,616
He held my hand. I looked down
and couldn't tell our fingers apart.

78
00:10:27,783 --> 00:10:32,174
- And I knew.
- What?

79
00:10:33,823 --> 00:10:39,216
- What?
- It was magic.

80
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:48,061
I knew we'd be together forever.
Just like you and Walter.

81
00:10:48,223 --> 00:10:52,421
Walter ... It's quite a formal name.

82
00:10:53,143 --> 00:10:59,059
I knew that your father and I would
have a wonderful time in the ...

83
00:10:59,223 --> 00:11:02,579
... sack, I believe you call it.

84
00:11:02,743 --> 00:11:08,773
It took years before it worked
like clockwork. It takes time.

85
00:11:08,943 --> 00:11:13,858
- We already ...
- Fine, fine. How's it working?

86
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:18,858
- Like clockwork.
- Oh, honey ...

87
00:11:21,063 --> 00:11:25,659
- It's a sign.
- You don't believe in signs.

88
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:34,381
They loved you.
I told you they would.

89
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:37,774
- I love you.
- I love you, Walter.

90
00:11:39,543 --> 00:11:44,571
Did anyone ever call you
anything other than Walter?

91
00:11:44,743 --> 00:11:50,852
- Not even when you were young?
- Not even when I was young.

92
00:11:51,023 --> 00:11:55,539
- Don't you want to drive with me?
- Then I can't get back on Friday.

93
00:11:55,703 --> 00:12:01,380
I forgot your stepmother's present.
When we're old and grey -

94
00:12:01,543 --> 00:12:07,493
- you must remind me to put my teeth
in, so I don't go out without them.

95
00:12:07,663 --> 00:12:10,461
I'll wait.

96
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:15,697
No, go ahead. We're late anyway.
I'll be ten minutes behind you.

97
00:12:44,943 --> 00:12:47,662
Welcome to "You and Emotions".

98
00:12:47,823 --> 00:12:53,295
I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone,
broadcasting live from Chicago.

99
00:12:53,463 --> 00:12:59,060
Tonight we'll talk about wishes.
What's your wish this Christmas?

100
00:12:59,223 --> 00:13:03,739
My wish is to change the station.

101
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:08,931
- And now: "You and your spleen".
- Not on your life.

102
00:13:09,103 --> 00:13:13,654
Coming up, "'Jingle bells" backwards ,
sung by ...

103
00:13:13,823 --> 00:13:17,816
- Seattle, go ahead.
- This is 'Jonah ...

104
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:22,499
No last names, 'Jonah.
How old are you?

105
00:13:22,663 --> 00:13:25,575
- I'm eight.
- You're up late.

106
00:13:25,743 --> 00:13:31,215
- It's not so late in Seattle.
- You're right. What's your wish?

107
00:13:31,383 --> 00:13:36,821
- My dad needs a new wife.
- You don't like the one he has?

108
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,817
- He doesn't have one.
- Where's your mum?

109
00:13:40,983 --> 00:13:46,421
- She died.
- Well. who can believe this?

110
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:52,135
- I've been sad, but Dad's worse.
- Have you talked to him about it?.

111
00:13:52,303 --> 00:13:57,502
No, that makes him sadder.

112
00:13:57,663 --> 00:14:00,257
'Jonah, is your dad home?

113
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:04,894
- Is he busy?
- No, he's out on the deck.

114
00:14:05,063 --> 00:14:08,100
Can't you ask him to talk to me?

115
00:14:08,263 --> 00:14:13,895
- Wretched woman! Hang up, Jonah!
- No, he'd kill me.

116
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:18,693
He won't be angry when he hears
how concerned you are about him.

117
00:14:18,863 --> 00:14:23,891
- Want to bet?
- If he yells, you lose a fan.

118
00:14:25,943 --> 00:14:31,415
Dad. there's someone
on the phone for you.

119
00:14:34,303 --> 00:14:36,737
His name is Sam.

120
00:14:36,903 --> 00:14:42,296
If you've just tuned in, tonight's
topic is wishes and dreams.

121
00:14:42,463 --> 00:14:45,819
We have a listener from Seattle.

122
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:49,578
Sam, this is Dr. Fieldstone
on Network America.

123
00:14:49,743 --> 00:14:54,771
What are you selling?
Micro-hibachis or knives?

124
00:14:54,943 --> 00:14:59,892
Neither. I want to help.
Your son asked me for advice.

125
00:15:00,063 --> 00:15:04,978
- He wants to find you a new wife.
- Who is this?

126
00:15:05,143 --> 00:15:10,536
Dr. Fieldstone of Network America.
You are on the air.

127
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:14,855
- You called a radio station?
- Sam, are you there?

128
00:15:15,023 --> 00:15:20,620
- Yes.
- You mourn your wife's death.

129
00:15:20,783 --> 00:15:24,139
Your son is worried about you.

130
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:28,694
Get out here.
I won't go through this alone.

131
00:15:28,863 --> 00:15:32,856
It's hard for him
to talk to you about this.

132
00:15:33,023 --> 00:15:37,574
If we talk about it,
maybe 'Jonah will feel better.

133
00:15:37,743 --> 00:15:42,771
- Talk to her. She's a doctor.
- Her first name could be Doctor.

134
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:49,655
- Please.
- Sam, it's his Christmas wish.

135
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,417
- Okay.
- Good.

136
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:57,611
I know this is difficult.
When did your wife die?

137
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:03,936
- About a year and a half ago.
- Have you had any relationships?

138
00:16:04,743 --> 00:16:08,941
- No.
- Why not?.

139
00:16:10,783 --> 00:16:14,537
- Marcia ... or Dr. Fieldstone?
- Dr. Marcia.

140
00:16:14,703 --> 00:16:20,619
- I don't mean to be rude ...
- I don't want to pry ...

141
00:16:20,783 --> 00:16:27,859
- Sure you do.
- Go on, Sam. I'm listening.

142
00:16:28,023 --> 00:16:33,051
We had a pretty tough time at first.

143
00:16:33,223 --> 00:16:37,341
But we're dealing with it.

144
00:16:37,503 --> 00:16:43,453
Jonah and I will get along fine,
as soon as I break his radio.

145
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,975
I'm sure you're a wonderful father.

146
00:16:48,143 --> 00:16:51,897
- You can tell a lot from a voice.
- Yes, you can.

147
00:16:52,063 --> 00:16:56,136
But 'Jonah still feels
that you're under a cloud.

148
00:16:56,303 --> 00:17:01,457
- Are you sleeping at night?.
- He doesn't sleep at all.

149
00:17:01,623 --> 00:17:05,696
- How do you know that?
- I live here. Dad.

150
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,019
Look. it's Christmas.

151
00:17:14,703 --> 00:17:18,252
Maggie ... my wife.

152
00:17:18,423 --> 00:17:21,301
She really did it ...

153
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:25,934
She loved ...
She made everything beautiful.

154
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:31,658
It's tough this time of year.

155
00:17:31,823 --> 00:17:38,774
- Every kid needs a mother.
- Maybe you need someone, too.

156
00:17:40,903 --> 00:17:45,419
- Yes.
- We'll resume after these messages.

157
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:51,852
Sam and 'Jonah, don't go away.
I'm talking to Sleepless in Seattle.

158
00:17:52,023 --> 00:17:55,857
We'll be back
with listener response.

159
00:17:56,023 --> 00:18:02,212
- What's that?
- People call in and dump on you.

160
00:18:02,383 --> 00:18:06,092
This is really fun. And helpful.

161
00:18:11,903 --> 00:18:17,455
- I bet he's tall with a cute butt.
- I bet he hasn't bathed in weeks.

162
00:18:17,623 --> 00:18:20,535
- Yes?
- Tea, with the bag out.

163
00:18:20,703 --> 00:18:27,575
- Maybe I'll just go up to Seattle.
- Don't open his refrigerator.

164
00:18:27,743 --> 00:18:32,942
Men don't cover food, and they
leave it in there till it walks out.

165
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:38,223
I wouldn't kick him out of bed
for eating crackers. 65 cents.

166
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:44,822
We'll take a call before we talk to
Sleepless. Go ahead, Tennessee.

167
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:49,460
I'd like to have his address.

168
00:18:49,623 --> 00:18:53,332
Honey, get in line.

169
00:18:54,463 --> 00:18:59,537
- If I could ask you a question ...
- Go ahead.

170
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:03,662
People who truly loved
are likely to love again.

171
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:09,898
Sam, could you love anybody
as much as you loved your wife?

172
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:15,101
Well, that's hard to imagine.

173
00:19:15,263 --> 00:19:18,255
What are you going to do?

174
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:25,340
Get out of bed every morning
and breathe in and out all day.

175
00:19:25,503 --> 00:19:33,342
And after a while I won't have to
remind myself to do it.

176
00:19:35,503 --> 00:19:42,978
And then after a while I won't
remember how perfect things were.

177
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:47,256
Why was your wife so special?

178
00:19:47,423 --> 00:19:50,733
Howling is your program?

179
00:19:53,143 --> 00:19:57,375
It was a million little things.

180
00:19:57,543 --> 00:20:02,014
When you added them up, it meant
we were meant for each other.

181
00:20:02,183 --> 00:20:06,381
I knew it
the very first time I touched her.

182
00:20:06,543 --> 00:20:12,220
It was like coming home,
only to no home I'd ever known.

183
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:15,534
I was just taking her hand -

184
00:20:15,703 --> 00:20:20,140
- to help her out of a car.
And I knew it.

185
00:20:21,383 --> 00:20:25,740
- It was ... Like magic.
- Magic.

186
00:20:26,503 --> 00:20:31,975
It's time to wrap it up.
I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone.

187
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:36,295
To all my listeners,
a magical and Merry Christmas.

188
00:20:36,463 --> 00:20:43,414
And Sleepless in Seattle,
call and tell us how it's going.

189
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,495
You can count on it.

190
00:21:32,703 --> 00:21:37,379
He sells the best soup ever and
he is the meanest man in America.

191
00:21:37,543 --> 00:21:42,014
- I feel strongly about this.
- Do it.

192
00:21:42,183 --> 00:21:44,651
New Year's Eve. I won't write it.

193
00:21:44,823 --> 00:21:48,896
Listen: "Phone service was
tied up Christmas Eve -

194
00:21:49,063 --> 00:21:53,215
- when a kid called the radio
and said his dad needs a new wife."

195
00:21:53,383 --> 00:21:56,932
2.000 women wanted his number.

196
00:21:57,103 --> 00:22:00,175
I heard it. This kid calls up, -

197
00:22:00,343 --> 00:22:06,179
- and the shrink forces
the father to talk about it.

198
00:22:06,343 --> 00:22:09,335
Suddenly he starts talking -

199
00:22:09,503 --> 00:22:15,658
- about how he fell in love with her
like these cows in Michigan.

200
00:22:15,823 --> 00:22:21,102
The cows that got zapped by stray
voltage. Maybe it was Wisconsin.

201
00:22:21,263 --> 00:22:27,452
Anyway, I was listening to him,
and suddenly I was crying.

202
00:22:27,623 --> 00:22:30,660
Like when I see the ad -

203
00:22:30,823 --> 00:22:35,578
- where the daughter gives her mum
the refrigerator with a red bow.

204
00:22:35,743 --> 00:22:41,136
- Or the to kids at the party ...
- Making an album for Grandfather!

205
00:22:41,303 --> 00:22:44,739
That kills me!

206
00:22:44,903 --> 00:22:48,452
Write about it. Whatever it is.

207
00:22:48,623 --> 00:22:54,175
2,000 women calling for a husband?
Women are desperate for love.

208
00:22:54,343 --> 00:22:59,371
- Especially over a certain age.
- It's hard to get married over 40.

209
00:22:59,543 --> 00:23:04,219
- That statistic is not true.
- But it feels true.

210
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:09,582
- It's true.
- A new book proves it isn't true.

211
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:13,895
- Did you read that book?
- Did anybody read that book?

212
00:23:14,063 --> 00:23:17,135
Are you done? Where were we?

213
00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:23,936
If someone's a widower, why is he
widowed and not widowered?

214
00:23:25,663 --> 00:23:28,302
Just wondering.

215
00:23:28,463 --> 00:23:32,695
What was that about up there?
What's with you?

216
00:23:32,863 --> 00:23:40,338
- Nothing.
- There's something. Tell me.

217
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:44,416
- Sleepless in Seattle?
- That's what she called him.

218
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:48,701
Now 2.000 women want his number.
He could be a crack head. -

219
00:23:48,863 --> 00:23:56,133
- a transvestite, a junkie,
or really sick, like my Rick.

220
00:23:57,423 --> 00:24:00,699
Actually, he sounded nice.

221
00:24:01,823 --> 00:24:06,692
Really?
Now we're getting down to it.

222
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:11,937
I'm madly in love with Walter. He
did a crazy thing the other night.

223
00:24:13,903 --> 00:24:19,500
It was so funny.
What was that?

224
00:24:28,703 --> 00:24:33,572
I've got to go to Boston
for the convention.

225
00:24:33,743 --> 00:24:37,577
And I have to visit Winston-Hughes.

226
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:42,216
Why don't we meet in New York
for Valentine's Day weekend?

227
00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:47,616
- Walter. I'd love to!
- We can stay at the Plaza.

228
00:24:48,183 --> 00:24:54,292
- Ice skate in Central Park.
- Register.

229
00:24:54,463 --> 00:24:59,173
You know ... for dishes.
glasses, silver, everything.

230
00:25:01,823 --> 00:25:04,098
How about it?

231
00:25:05,823 --> 00:25:10,180
- We'll have dim sum in Chinatown.
- Is there wheat in it?

232
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:13,938
I don't think so.

233
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:24,301
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, -

234
00:25:24,463 --> 00:25:28,536
- five. four. three. to. one ...

235
00:25:28,703 --> 00:25:32,821
Jonah, wake up.
The ball's dropping.

236
00:26:19,183 --> 00:26:23,176
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

237
00:26:26,663 --> 00:26:30,656
- Kiss Howard.
- Goodnight, Howard.

238
00:27:59,383 --> 00:28:02,500
Can I have half your beer?

239
00:28:02,663 --> 00:28:06,702
Go ahead.

240
00:28:06,863 --> 00:28:11,857
What did I use to say?
"Here's looking at you"?

241
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:15,982
-"Here's mud in your eye"?
-"Here's to us."

242
00:28:16,143 --> 00:28:19,818
You used to say: "Here's to us."

243
00:28:23,663 --> 00:28:27,702
Oh. babe.
I miss you so much it hurts.

244
00:28:44,463 --> 00:28:44,503
You want to tell him? I'll tell him.

245
00:28:44,503 --> 00:28:48,496
You want to tell him? I'll tell him.

246
00:28:48,663 --> 00:28:52,133
She's back with another idea.

247
00:28:52,303 --> 00:28:57,935
Sam, I'm glad you're here. I heard
you on the radio. I told everyone.

248
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:02,779
- We already knew. From Grace.
- Then all of Seattle knows.

249
00:29:02,943 --> 00:29:08,142
I was brushing my teeth and there
you were. I called my mother.

250
00:29:08,303 --> 00:29:13,013
I said. "Turn on the radio.
That's my architect."

251
00:29:13,183 --> 00:29:19,019
You know. it's so nice
when a man can express his feelings.

252
00:29:19,183 --> 00:29:23,142
- I wish I could.
- Claire, is there a problem?

253
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:27,262
I couldn't sleep last night.
You know what that's like.

254
00:29:27,423 --> 00:29:32,178
My platters
won't fit in the refrigerator.

255
00:29:32,343 --> 00:29:37,656
At parties I use platters, so I want
a Sub Zero refrigerator instead.

256
00:29:37,823 --> 00:29:42,499
- We have to redo the cabinets.
- We'll be into this wall.

257
00:29:42,663 --> 00:29:47,612
- A bearing wall.
- That's a delay of five, six ...

258
00:29:47,783 --> 00:29:53,415
- 12 weeks.
- It's important to get it right.

259
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:57,974
Well. la decorateur calls.
Bye.

260
00:30:01,863 --> 00:30:06,300
It's fate. She's divorced. we don't
want to do this and you need a wife.

261
00:30:06,463 --> 00:30:10,775
- Everything intersects.
- Like the Bermuda Triangle.

262
00:30:20,023 --> 00:30:25,541
Here's one more. Do you have room?

263
00:30:25,703 --> 00:30:29,935
- Dad, they're all for you.
- Here you go.

264
00:30:32,543 --> 00:30:35,182
"Sleepless in Seattle".

265
00:30:35,343 --> 00:30:39,894
If you can't sleep, try drinking a
glass of water from the other side.

266
00:30:40,063 --> 00:30:46,582
That's for hiccups. Or you can hold
a spoonful of sugar in your mouth.

267
00:30:47,383 --> 00:30:49,658
Thank you.

268
00:30:49,823 --> 00:30:55,580
- But why give them our address?
- They called and asked for it.

269
00:30:55,743 --> 00:31:01,739
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are
the most attractive man I've heard."

270
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:06,499
They called?
You gave them our number, too?

271
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:09,575
You have to, to get on the air.

272
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:13,338
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle.
I live in Tulsa." Where's that?

273
00:31:13,503 --> 00:31:18,452
- In Oklahoma. Where is that?
- Somewhere in the middle.

274
00:31:18,623 --> 00:31:23,617
I won't think about
what they don't teach you at school.

275
00:31:23,783 --> 00:31:29,096
I think we should rule out
anyone who doesn't live near here.

276
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:33,142
She's willing to fly anywhere.

277
00:31:33,303 --> 00:31:39,253
Looks like my third-grade teacher.
She is my third-grade teacher!

278
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:44,613
- Don't you want to read these?
- No. it's not how it's done.

279
00:31:44,783 --> 00:31:48,856
I'd rather see somebody I like.

280
00:31:49,023 --> 00:31:54,097
- Then I'd ask her out for a drink.
- Or a slice of pizza.

281
00:31:54,263 --> 00:31:59,701
No dinner on the first date. because
halfway through you could regret it.

282
00:31:59,863 --> 00:32:03,981
But if you like them after a drink,
you can always ask them to dinner.

283
00:32:04,143 --> 00:32:08,102
If not, you can say,
"That was great," and go home.

284
00:32:08,263 --> 00:32:13,212
You see? I wonder
if it still works this way.

285
00:32:13,383 --> 00:32:17,422
- It doesn't. They ask you.
- I'm starting to notice that.

286
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:21,895
If you get a new wife,
you'll have sex with her, huh?

287
00:32:22,063 --> 00:32:28,013
- I certainly hope so.
- Will she scratch up your back?

288
00:32:28,183 --> 00:32:33,382
In movies women always scratch the
man's back and scream during sex.

289
00:32:33,543 --> 00:32:38,936
- How do you know this?
- Jed's got cable.

290
00:32:40,183 --> 00:32:43,619
Hand me that towel, please.

291
00:32:47,143 --> 00:32:52,695
Thank you. Let me get you.
"Jed's got cable!"

292
00:34:17,183 --> 00:34:22,496
Now to Dr. Fieldstone, psychologist
and the friend you never have.

293
00:34:22,663 --> 00:34:26,542
- Remember Marooned in Miami?
- He doesn't love me anymore.

294
00:34:26,703 --> 00:34:31,094
- Then why stay with him?
- Disappointed in Denver.

295
00:34:31,263 --> 00:34:35,336
When I come close to orgasm,
he goes to make a sandwich.

296
00:34:35,503 --> 00:34:39,337
- Make a sandwich beforehand.
- Sleepless in Seattle.

297
00:34:39,503 --> 00:34:47,421
I'll get up every morning
and breathe all day long.

298
00:34:48,103 --> 00:34:52,494
After a while I won't have to
remind myself-

299
00:34:52,663 --> 00:34:57,054
- to get up and breathe in and out.

300
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:03,618
Then after a while I won't
have to think about-

301
00:35:03,783 --> 00:35:07,776
- howl had it great and perfect
for a while.

302
00:35:07,943 --> 00:35:11,299
Why was your wife so special?

303
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:16,659
How long is your program?

304
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:22,500
It was a million little things.

305
00:35:22,663 --> 00:35:27,100
When you added them up, it meant
we were meant for each other.

306
00:35:27,263 --> 00:35:31,779
I knew it,
the first time I touched her.

307
00:35:31,943 --> 00:35:37,142
It was like coming home,
only to no home I'd ever known.

308
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:43,253
I was just taking her hand
to help her out of a car.

309
00:35:43,423 --> 00:35:48,417
And I knew it.
It was like ...

310
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:52,053
... magic.

311
00:36:10,823 --> 00:36:15,180
I think I'm going crazy, Dennis.
Are you happily married?

312
00:36:15,343 --> 00:36:19,973
Why did you get married?
Was it trumpets and fireworks?

313
00:36:20,143 --> 00:36:24,819
Betsy said we had to break up
or get married. That's why.

314
00:36:25,663 --> 00:36:29,656
When you met, did you think
she was the only one for you?

315
00:36:29,823 --> 00:36:32,815
That in some way it was fated?

316
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:36,612
Annie. attraction is -

317
00:36:36,783 --> 00:36:41,618
- when your subconscious is
attracted to their subconscious.

318
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:46,732
Fate is to neuroses
knowing they're a perfect match.

319
00:36:46,903 --> 00:36:52,773
I'm having all these fantasies
about a man I never even met!

320
00:36:52,943 --> 00:36:56,902
- And he lives in Seattle!
- It rains nine months a year there.

321
00:36:57,063 --> 00:37:01,853
I know. I won't move to Seattle.

322
00:37:04,543 --> 00:37:10,652
But I don't want to end up wondering
what might have happened.

323
00:37:10,823 --> 00:37:15,374
What do you think?
It's cold feet. isn't it?

324
00:37:15,543 --> 00:37:19,855
- Everybody panics. Didn't you?
- Yes. I did.

325
00:37:20,023 --> 00:37:25,541
Thanks. Dennis. I feel better now.

326
00:37:26,103 --> 00:37:31,336
Sandy's friend is a weightlifter,
but her neck isn't that big.

327
00:37:31,503 --> 00:37:38,295
No, don't set me up. I want to know
what it's like out there.

328
00:37:38,463 --> 00:37:43,332
Women are looking
for pecs and a cute butt.

329
00:37:43,503 --> 00:37:47,542
"He has the cutest butt."
Where did I hear that recently?

330
00:37:47,703 --> 00:37:54,176
Everywhere. Even on the news
women talk about cute butts.

331
00:37:54,343 --> 00:37:57,653
It's really caught on.

332
00:37:57,823 --> 00:38:01,213
So how's my butt?

333
00:38:02,303 --> 00:38:05,500
- Not bad.
- Is it cute though?

334
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:07,972
Are we grading on a curve?

335
00:38:09,143 --> 00:38:13,341
When was your last date?

336
00:38:14,623 --> 00:38:18,411
Jimmy Carter ... 1978.

337
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:24,101
Things are different now.
First you have to be friends.

338
00:38:24,263 --> 00:38:27,938
Then you neck.
This could go on for years.

339
00:38:28,103 --> 00:38:32,460
Then you have tests and do it with a
condom. But you do split the check.

340
00:38:33,343 --> 00:38:38,212
- I can't let a woman pay.
- They'll throw a parade for you.

341
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:42,376
You'll be Man of the Year.

342
00:38:42,543 --> 00:38:47,378
Tira misu.
You'll find out what that is.

343
00:38:47,543 --> 00:38:51,775
Some woman will want me to do it
to her. and I won't know what it is.

344
00:38:51,943 --> 00:38:58,781
- You'll love it.
- This is going to be tough.

345
00:38:58,943 --> 00:39:05,132
What about that decorator?
She's perky.

346
00:39:05,303 --> 00:39:11,538
No. I'm far away from that.
I'm just making notes.

347
00:39:11,703 --> 00:39:16,652
- How would I do it?
- Ask her over to look at swatches.

348
00:39:16,823 --> 00:39:21,533
- To look at swatches?
- Yeah. colour schemes.

349
00:39:21,703 --> 00:39:27,255
Don't do it like I did. Be suave.
Think Cary Grant.

350
00:39:27,423 --> 00:39:31,496
Would he say,
"Come look at my swatches"?

351
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:36,418
- Not it in movies ...
- Not in "Gunga Din"?

352
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:40,940
"Gunga Din" isn't that kind of film.
Who knows what he did in real life.

353
00:39:41,103 --> 00:39:46,223
- He did that with Dyan Cannon?
- "Dyan, look at these swatches."

354
00:40:04,063 --> 00:40:06,531
Jonah. I'm home!

355
00:40:09,143 --> 00:40:11,532
Jonah?

356
00:40:28,823 --> 00:40:31,974
Hi. Dad. This is Jessica.

357
00:40:32,143 --> 00:40:35,340
Nice to meet you.

358
00:40:35,503 --> 00:40:40,258
This is amazing. If you play this
backwards, it says "Paul is dead."

359
00:40:40,423 --> 00:40:45,736
- Yeah. I know.
- How do you know?

360
00:40:46,703 --> 00:40:51,174
- Dad, could you shut the door?
- Sure.

361
00:40:51,343 --> 00:40:56,861
H and G.
Hi and goodbye.

362
00:42:06,623 --> 00:42:09,456
Hello. Victoria?

363
00:42:09,623 --> 00:42:14,856
This is Sam Baldwin.
I don't know if you remember me ...

364
00:42:15,023 --> 00:42:18,811
Oh, great.

365
00:42:18,983 --> 00:42:25,536
I was wondering if you would like
to have a drink with me?

366
00:42:25,703 --> 00:42:28,058
Dinner?

367
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:31,738
Dinner would be even better.

368
00:42:31,903 --> 00:42:35,213
Friday would be great.

369
00:42:35,383 --> 00:42:38,932
I hear that's a good place.

370
00:42:40,103 --> 00:42:44,540
Seven-thirty is fine. And I'll ...

371
00:42:46,423 --> 00:42:50,382
Okay, I'll meet you there.

372
00:42:50,543 --> 00:42:56,732
So it's Friday
at seven-thirty for dinner. Great.

373
00:42:58,303 --> 00:43:01,659
Me, too. Bye.

374
00:43:06,783 --> 00:43:12,938
- Are you in love with him?
- Not now.

375
00:43:13,103 --> 00:43:18,780
- Those people knew how to love.
- You're a basket case.

376
00:43:18,943 --> 00:43:24,939
They knew it. Nothing could
separate them because they knew.

377
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:28,539
- It was real.
- It's a movie.

378
00:43:28,703 --> 00:43:34,141
You don't want to be in love.
you want to be in a movie. Read it.

379
00:43:35,223 --> 00:43:39,375
"Dear Sleepless and Son. I've never
written a letter like this before."

380
00:43:39,543 --> 00:43:44,981
- That's what everyone writes.
- You think I don't know that?

381
00:43:45,783 --> 00:43:48,616
What about Walter?

382
00:43:48,783 --> 00:43:52,617
I'd give anything to marry Walter.

383
00:43:52,783 --> 00:43:58,733
He's so unexpected. You think
you know him, but you don't.

384
00:43:59,543 --> 00:44:02,501
I should write about magic.

385
00:44:02,663 --> 00:44:07,293
What if this man is my destiny,
and I never meet him?

386
00:44:07,463 --> 00:44:11,979
- Your destiny can be your doom.
- "I want to meet you ..."

387
00:44:12,143 --> 00:44:16,853
- At the Empire State Building.
- At the Empire State Building.

388
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:20,413
Sunset, Valentine's Day.

389
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:24,542
I'll be in New York with Walter.
I can squeeze it in.

390
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:28,332
I'll be in New York with Walter!

391
00:44:34,223 --> 00:44:39,820
Because of fate I married Martin and
bought the house with the dead tree.

392
00:44:39,983 --> 00:44:44,056
On account of which I got divorced
and hit a car -

393
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:47,499
- and met Rick.
while buying a neck brace.

394
00:44:47,663 --> 00:44:51,133
You got divorced because of a tree?

395
00:44:51,303 --> 00:44:54,579
- The tree man.
- You fell in love with him?

396
00:44:54,743 --> 00:45:00,534
I did not say love.
This is my favourite part.

397
00:45:01,623 --> 00:45:07,698
- It's now or never.
- Never is a frightening word.

398
00:45:07,863 --> 00:45:12,220
We'd be fools to let
happiness pass us by.

399
00:45:13,383 --> 00:45:18,298
Winter must be cold
for those with no warm memories.

400
00:45:19,543 --> 00:45:23,422
We've already missed the spring.

401
00:45:24,463 --> 00:45:29,298
- Men never get this movie.
- I know.

402
00:45:30,263 --> 00:45:32,902
Mummy! Mummy!

403
00:45:35,063 --> 00:45:41,536
- Mummy!
- It's okay. I'm here. I'm coming.

404
00:45:43,463 --> 00:45:47,456
It's okay. What was that about?

405
00:45:47,623 --> 00:45:52,902
Our house was sinking. There was
water coming in all the windows.

406
00:45:54,423 --> 00:45:58,974
Well, it's okay now.

407
00:46:00,063 --> 00:46:06,013
What shall we do? Your mother sang
to when you had bad dreams.

408
00:46:06,903 --> 00:46:10,532
"Bye Bye Blackbird".

409
00:46:12,023 --> 00:46:16,892
I miss her. What happens
to someone after they die?

410
00:46:18,343 --> 00:46:23,053
- I don't know.
- Do you believe in heaven?

411
00:46:25,263 --> 00:46:31,736
I never believed in an afterlife.
But now. I don't know.

412
00:46:32,423 --> 00:46:38,532
Because I've had these dreams
about your mum.

413
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:44,498
We have long talks ... about you.

414
00:46:44,663 --> 00:46:50,693
How you're doing. She sort of
knows, but I tell her anyway.

415
00:46:50,863 --> 00:46:57,052
So what is that?
It's sort of an afterlife. isn't it?

416
00:46:58,063 --> 00:47:02,693
I'm starting to forget her.

417
00:47:15,343 --> 00:47:20,019
She could peel an apple -

418
00:47:20,183 --> 00:47:25,211
- in one long, curly strip.

419
00:47:26,383 --> 00:47:30,342
The whole apple.

420
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:45,137
- I love you, Jonah.
- I love you, Dad.

421
00:47:50,943 --> 00:47:53,901
See you tomorrow.

422
00:49:03,303 --> 00:49:08,900
Laurie? It's Annie.
I'm fine.

423
00:49:09,063 --> 00:49:16,060
I'm writing about radio shows.
Do you know Dr. Fieldstone?

424
00:49:16,223 --> 00:49:21,820
I work for the Baltimore Sun. and
I'm doing a piece on bereavement.

425
00:49:21,983 --> 00:49:25,771
I understand
you had a caller from Seattle ...

426
00:49:33,703 --> 00:49:38,538
This is 'Jonah Baldwin.
We're not in right now...

427
00:50:38,743 --> 00:50:42,099
Architect.

428
00:51:12,743 --> 00:51:18,898
I'll be back either by midnight
or 8:30. if disaster strikes.

429
00:51:19,063 --> 00:51:23,295
- Here's one for both of us.
- "Sleepless and Son, Baltimore."

430
00:51:23,463 --> 00:51:26,853
Here's the doctor's number.

431
00:51:27,023 --> 00:51:31,892
Here's a bottle of ipecac
if anybody drinks poison.

432
00:51:32,063 --> 00:51:36,773
How do I look?
Do I look all right?

433
00:51:36,943 --> 00:51:42,222
I look stupid. I'm trying too hard.
I was going to get a haircut.

434
00:51:42,383 --> 00:51:46,979
- This is a good letter, Dad.
- These heels are grotesque.

435
00:51:47,143 --> 00:51:50,055
Her name is Annie Reed.

436
00:51:50,223 --> 00:51:53,613
Dad. read this.

437
00:51:55,183 --> 00:51:59,096
"Dear Sleepless and Son ..."

438
00:51:59,263 --> 00:52:03,700
"I'm an excellent third baseman.
and let me tell you, -

439
00:52:03,863 --> 00:52:08,493
- Robinson was the best. We must
agree on this. I'm from Baltimore."

440
00:52:08,663 --> 00:52:13,691
She likes Brooks Robinson.
So do you. It's a sign.

441
00:52:13,863 --> 00:52:18,300
Come here. I'll show you a sign.

442
00:52:20,903 --> 00:52:26,933
Where's Seattle?
And Baltimore? Right there!

443
00:52:27,103 --> 00:52:32,131
There's like 26 states between
here and there. That's a sign.

444
00:52:32,303 --> 00:52:37,138
I'm out of here. Goodbye.
I love you.

445
00:52:39,943 --> 00:52:44,300
Clarise, did you move your car?

446
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:56,412
- Thanks. Derrick. I'll have ...
- White wine spritzer?

447
00:52:56,583 --> 00:52:59,859
- And you, sir?
- I'm fine.

448
00:53:00,023 --> 00:53:04,813
- You look good.
- So do you.

449
00:53:07,903 --> 00:53:10,895
I thought you'd never call me.

450
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:14,214
I really wanted you to.

451
00:53:14,383 --> 00:53:20,015
Mr. Baldwin, phone call for you.

452
00:53:26,383 --> 00:53:31,457
Dad, can we go to New York
for Valentine's Day?

453
00:53:31,623 --> 00:53:37,380
Annie Reed wants to meet us at the
top of the Empire State Building.

454
00:53:37,543 --> 00:53:44,255
Jonah, have you fallen down?
Has Clarise been strangled?

455
00:53:44,423 --> 00:53:47,381
- No.
- Is that the reason you're calling?

456
00:53:47,543 --> 00:53:52,663
We can get cheap tickets
from Jessica's parents.

457
00:53:52,823 --> 00:53:56,896
We'll talk about it later.

458
00:53:57,063 --> 00:54:02,012
This conversation has lasted
too long. Go to bed.

459
00:54:07,423 --> 00:54:11,621
- Everything all right?
- Yes. Do you have kids?

460
00:54:11,783 --> 00:54:14,855
You want mine?

461
00:54:15,703 --> 00:54:19,776
I'll have an Absolut straight up.

462
00:54:35,743 --> 00:54:39,258
Put that down. Stop it!

463
00:54:39,423 --> 00:54:43,382
- There she is.
- Why is she bringing groceries?

464
00:54:43,543 --> 00:54:48,412
- She's going to cook for us.
- Hi. Sam.

465
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:52,462
Let me guess. You must be Jonah.

466
00:54:55,223 --> 00:54:59,501
This is it? The car is this way.

467
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:06,296
She's on her sixth painter. And now
she wants the fireplace rebricked.

468
00:55:06,463 --> 00:55:12,732
- I know her. I could call her.
- I'll just hit her with a brick.

469
00:55:15,143 --> 00:55:18,055
That's so funny. You're so funny.

470
00:55:18,223 --> 00:55:24,014
When she wants something done
she says: "You know best."

471
00:55:24,183 --> 00:55:29,211
"But couldn't we flip the house
so the back is in front?"

472
00:55:29,383 --> 00:55:35,219
"Put the front on a hinge so I can
get in with a garage door opener."

473
00:55:35,383 --> 00:55:41,413
- "Yes, we can. We'll just ..."
- "Move the cabinets."

474
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:51,898
Jonah, bring some of that stuff.

475
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,975
Do you like baseball?

476
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:59,853
Yes. In fact my firm has box seats
to the Mariners. Let's go some day.

477
00:56:01,503 --> 00:56:06,133
What about camping?
Do you like that?

478
00:56:06,303 --> 00:56:08,976
I went camping once.

479
00:56:09,143 --> 00:56:14,661
- We should go camping more often.
- You're right. Time for bed.

480
00:56:14,823 --> 00:56:19,214
- It's only 10:00.
- That's right. Time for bed.

481
00:56:19,383 --> 00:56:22,261
Goodnight.

482
00:56:23,823 --> 00:56:27,657
Thank Victoria for the nice dinner.

483
00:56:27,823 --> 00:56:32,692
Thanks for dinner. I never saw
anybody cook potatoes that way.

484
00:56:32,863 --> 00:56:38,381
I'm glad you liked it.
Goodnight, Jonah.

485
00:56:39,623 --> 00:56:45,334
We don't see a lot of potatoes here.
We're rice men.

486
00:57:36,663 --> 00:57:39,780
I'm sorry, Walter. I'm sorry.

487
00:57:44,303 --> 00:57:46,817
Turn on your radio.

488
00:57:46,983 --> 00:57:51,773
The kid is on. You've got me
listening to this garbage!

489
00:57:52,663 --> 00:57:59,455
Becky's having trouble with Rick.
Becky, I'll call you back.

490
00:58:02,183 --> 00:58:06,495
I'm sorry, Walter.
Are you bleeding?

491
00:58:24,903 --> 00:58:27,940
He's kissing her right now!

492
00:58:28,103 --> 00:58:31,732
Are you spying on your father?.

493
00:58:31,903 --> 00:58:36,738
- Who is he kissing?
- I have to make them stop.

494
00:58:36,903 --> 00:58:40,862
- How will I explain this to Walter?
- She made dinner.

495
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:44,095
She brought food for a whole year!

496
00:58:44,263 --> 00:58:48,575
It's good that your father's dating.
It's just hard on you.

497
00:58:48,743 --> 00:58:52,941
You think you want it,
but when it happens, it scares you.

498
00:58:53,103 --> 00:58:58,336
Shouldn't your father decide
whether someone is right for him?

499
00:58:58,503 --> 00:59:00,698
He's not sane enough.

500
00:59:00,863 --> 00:59:06,495
He's kissing her on the lips.
My dad's been captured by a 'ho!

501
00:59:06,663 --> 00:59:11,179
Calm down. Tomorrow,
when you're having breakfast, -

502
00:59:11,343 --> 00:59:16,975
- tell him how you feel.
Don't keep it inside.

503
00:59:21,343 --> 00:59:25,734
Miss Scarlett. In the broom closet.
With the radio.

504
00:59:25,903 --> 00:59:31,216
Walter, you scared me.
Don't ever do that again.

505
00:59:33,983 --> 00:59:38,534
- I saw a black widow.
- You scared me and Victoria.

506
00:59:38,703 --> 00:59:43,458
- It was right there.
- Next time I want you to say:

507
00:59:43,623 --> 00:59:47,741
"Dad, I see a poisonous insect."

508
00:59:47,903 --> 00:59:51,213
And I'll deal with it. Don't scream.

509
00:59:51,383 --> 00:59:55,695
Becky thought Rick was on the radio.

510
00:59:55,863 --> 01:00:01,540
It turned out the guy lived
in Duluth. Where's Duluth?

511
01:00:01,703 --> 01:00:05,981
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I know. No sense at all.

512
01:00:06,143 --> 01:00:11,615
- Thank God my life is in place.
- Duluth? That's in North Dakota.

513
01:00:25,383 --> 01:00:30,093
- Great letter. Write to her.
- You think so?

514
01:00:30,263 --> 01:00:35,542
It's Y-O-H.
Your only hope.

515
01:00:46,783 --> 01:00:51,982
I thought I'd do a story
on those radio shows.

516
01:00:52,143 --> 01:00:56,580
- You'd have to go somewhere.
- Definitely.

517
01:01:14,703 --> 01:01:18,901
- Can't you do a phone interview?
- No.

518
01:01:19,063 --> 01:01:23,181
- I won't be in Chicago long.
- When you get back, I'll be gone.

519
01:01:23,343 --> 01:01:27,302
- Then I'll see you in New York.
- I'll get it ...

520
01:01:31,303 --> 01:01:36,172
This is Captain Browning.
We're cruising at 35,000 feet.

521
01:01:36,343 --> 01:01:41,576
The weather is clear
and we'll be in Seattle on schedule.

522
01:01:41,743 --> 01:01:49,297
- Don't you hate flying?
- Yes. and I've told a terrible lie.

523
01:01:49,463 --> 01:01:53,251
Is any lie a betrayal?

524
01:01:53,423 --> 01:01:57,575
I said flying.

525
01:02:02,543 --> 01:02:06,775
- Thanks for bringing me here.
- He likes the planes.

526
01:02:06,943 --> 01:02:13,462
Can I bring you back a souvenir?
Maybe one of these snow globes?

527
01:02:13,623 --> 01:02:18,253
Sure, I'd really like that.
Thank you so much.

528
01:02:19,623 --> 01:02:23,093
- He's eight.
- He's good at it.

529
01:02:23,263 --> 01:02:28,098
I've read an article about it.
Children are hideous at that age.

530
01:02:28,263 --> 01:02:34,941
Maybe when I come back, the to of
us ought to spend some time alone.

531
01:02:39,263 --> 01:02:42,255
Bye. Bye, Jonah.

532
01:02:47,303 --> 01:02:49,419
Jonah.

533
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:52,939
Listen, you don't know Victoria.

534
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:58,018
In fact she's a mystery to me, too.

535
01:02:58,183 --> 01:03:02,062
She tosses her hair a lot. Why?

536
01:03:02,223 --> 01:03:07,013
Is it a titch? Does she need
a haircut or a barrette?

537
01:03:08,583 --> 01:03:15,694
I'd like to understand these things.
And that's why I'm dating her.

538
01:03:15,863 --> 01:03:21,017
Just dating. I'm not living
with her. I'm not marrying her.

539
01:03:21,183 --> 01:03:24,573
Can you appreciate the difference?

540
01:03:24,743 --> 01:03:29,180
That's what single people do.
They see how other people fit.

541
01:03:29,343 --> 01:03:35,657
Everyone's an adjustment. There's
no such thing as a perfect ...

542
01:03:50,383 --> 01:03:53,819
Come on.

543
01:03:54,343 --> 01:04:00,657
Dad, Jessica says
you knew Annie in another life.

544
01:04:00,823 --> 01:04:05,419
The one who wrote us. But you
never got together in that life.

545
01:04:05,583 --> 01:04:11,260
Your hearts will be a complete
puzzle once you're together.

546
01:04:11,423 --> 01:04:17,976
I know that because I'm young and
pure, in touch with cosmic forces.

547
01:04:18,143 --> 01:04:23,456
Who told you that? I sure hope
you're not marrying Jessica.

548
01:07:00,423 --> 01:07:05,053
- I watched them play at the beach.
- Did you talk to him?

549
01:07:05,223 --> 01:07:08,659
Couldn't do it.

550
01:07:08,823 --> 01:07:14,295
- How did I get here?
- You lied and got on a plane.

551
01:07:15,503 --> 01:07:22,534
- I'm going to talk to him tomorrow.
- Okay. Good. Goodbye.

552
01:07:22,703 --> 01:07:25,979
Beck ...

553
01:07:26,623 --> 01:07:32,220
- Is this crazy?
- No, that's the weirdest part

554
01:07:32,383 --> 01:07:38,253
- Thank you. I love you.
- I love you, too.

555
01:08:38,103 --> 01:08:42,221
It's good to see you. Where's Greg?

556
01:09:04,183 --> 01:09:08,096
Hello.

557
01:09:14,503 --> 01:09:18,701
- Then what?
- I left, obviously.

558
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:24,381
- You were in the street?
- It was like walking around naked.

559
01:09:24,543 --> 01:09:29,981
- I love that dream.
- This was more humiliating.

560
01:09:30,143 --> 01:09:34,022
But he saw you.
You were face to face.

561
01:09:34,183 --> 01:09:40,736
He said hello.
And all I could say was hello.

562
01:09:41,623 --> 01:09:46,981
- All I could say was hello.
- It's a sign.

563
01:09:47,143 --> 01:09:52,058
It's a sign that I've watched
this movie too many times.

564
01:09:52,223 --> 01:09:58,571
From the minute I heard that program
I've been a complete jerk.

565
01:09:58,743 --> 01:10:02,452
- You're not a jerk.
- Thank you. An idiot!

566
01:10:02,623 --> 01:10:08,141
- You don't know who she was.
- I have a picture of her.

567
01:10:08,303 --> 01:10:14,378
The detective sent it to me.
See. that's what she looks like.

568
01:10:15,223 --> 01:10:20,138
- It's her back.
- It's her and he's crazy about her.

569
01:10:20,303 --> 01:10:25,013
What's this?
It's from Seattle.

570
01:10:31,783 --> 01:10:34,377
Becky.

571
01:10:35,423 --> 01:10:38,733
So I mailed your letter ...

572
01:10:39,423 --> 01:10:45,214
"Dear Annie. Thanks for your letter.
You sound neat."

573
01:10:48,383 --> 01:10:53,332
"We're excited about meeting you
in New York, and seeing if we're ...

574
01:10:53,503 --> 01:10:57,781
... M-F-E-O."

575
01:10:57,943 --> 01:11:01,982
"See you soon.
Sleepless in Seattle."

576
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:06,022
M-F-E-O?

577
01:11:07,743 --> 01:11:11,213
Made for each other.

578
01:11:11,383 --> 01:11:14,420
It's cute. Like a little clue.

579
01:11:18,823 --> 01:11:22,054
So he can't write. Big deal.

580
01:11:22,223 --> 01:11:27,661
Verbal ability is overrated in guys.
Our need for it leads to trouble.

581
01:11:27,823 --> 01:11:32,658
- I'm going to run back to Walter.
- And the letter?

582
01:11:32,823 --> 01:11:37,419
It was written before I went
out there. Before the 'ho.

583
01:11:39,943 --> 01:11:46,655
But she didn't look like a 'ho.
She looked like one of our friends.

584
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:55,775
- You saw her in the airport, too?
- It was like I knew her.

585
01:11:55,943 --> 01:12:01,142
- Like a deja-vu?
- It was very deja-vu-ish.

586
01:12:01,303 --> 01:12:06,741
- At least you're seeing people.
- Well, only one ...

587
01:12:06,903 --> 01:12:10,862
- Victoria.
- You don't like her?

588
01:12:11,023 --> 01:12:16,097
- She laughs like a hyena.
- Is this true?

589
01:12:16,263 --> 01:12:20,256
Sort of. Tell them what you did.

590
01:12:20,423 --> 01:12:23,540
Tell them about the radio show.

591
01:12:23,703 --> 01:12:27,298
Christmas Eve he calls a radio show.

592
01:12:27,463 --> 01:12:34,062
- And tells them I need a new wife.
- That's so sweet.

593
01:12:34,223 --> 01:12:38,136
Now he's obsessed with
a woman who wrote me.

594
01:12:38,303 --> 01:12:43,297
She wants to meet me on top of
Empire State on Valentines Day.

595
01:12:43,463 --> 01:12:48,856
It's like that movie.
"An Affair to Remember".

596
01:12:49,023 --> 01:12:53,892
Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.
Is that "car" or "cur"?

597
01:12:57,103 --> 01:13:02,621
They were to meet at the Empire
State, but she got hit by a taxi.

598
01:13:02,783 --> 01:13:07,459
He waited and waited.
And it was raining.

599
01:13:07,623 --> 01:13:13,812
Then she's too proud
to tell him that she's ...

600
01:13:16,103 --> 01:13:21,735
... crippled. And he's too proud
to find out why she doesn't come.

601
01:13:21,903 --> 01:13:25,612
But he comes to see her anyway.

602
01:13:25,783 --> 01:13:30,299
It's amazing when he visits her.

603
01:13:30,463 --> 01:13:34,979
He doesn't notice that she
doesn't get up to say hello.

604
01:13:35,143 --> 01:13:38,260
And he's very bitter.

605
01:13:38,423 --> 01:13:43,099
You think he's going to walk out
and never know why.

606
01:13:43,263 --> 01:13:51,136
She's just lying there with
a blanket over her shriveled legs.

607
01:13:53,143 --> 01:13:56,215
- Are you all right?
- She's fine.

608
01:13:56,383 --> 01:14:02,572
The he says, "I saw the painting,"
and goes into the bedroom.

609
01:14:02,743 --> 01:14:06,531
And he comes out and looks at her.

610
01:14:06,703 --> 01:14:11,015
And they just know
and hug and it's so ...

611
01:14:11,183 --> 01:14:14,653
- That's a chick's movie.
- I'd say so.

612
01:14:14,823 --> 01:14:20,455
- Who'd write a guy from the radio?
- I got hundreds of letters.

613
01:14:20,623 --> 01:14:25,139
- Desperate women.
- Is wanting a nice guy desperate?

614
01:14:25,303 --> 01:14:30,536
It's easier to be killed
by terrorists than to marry over 40.

615
01:14:30,703 --> 01:14:34,935
- That is not true!
- Right, honey.

616
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:40,336
I don't want a mail-order bride.
Just someone who can converse -

617
01:14:40,503 --> 01:14:46,100
- without falling into
weepy tears over an old movie.

618
01:14:46,263 --> 01:14:52,054
I cried over "The Dirty Dozen".
Jim Brown throwing the grenades.

619
01:14:52,223 --> 01:14:57,616
Richard Jaeckel and Lee Marvin
on top of a tank dressed like nazis.

620
01:14:59,263 --> 01:15:05,975
Trini Lopez ... breaks his neck
when they're parachuting.

621
01:15:06,143 --> 01:15:10,773
Richard Jaeckel had on a shiny
helmet. because he was an MP.

622
01:15:10,943 --> 01:15:15,494
Please. no more.
God. I love that movie.

623
01:15:23,543 --> 01:15:28,059
- This is the best movie I ever saw.
- What's so great about it?

624
01:15:28,223 --> 01:15:32,694
- You have to find her.
- How much would it cost to go?

625
01:15:32,863 --> 01:15:37,334
Nobody knows.
It changes practically every day.

626
01:15:37,503 --> 01:15:40,654
- How much money do you have?
- 80 dollars.

627
01:15:40,823 --> 01:15:46,580
- I have 42. That'll cover cabs.
- How would I get there?

628
01:15:46,743 --> 01:15:52,261
I have to drop these tickets off.
Can you keep an eye on things?

629
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:05,334
- Window seat or aisle?
- Window.

630
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:10,099
You want a fruit plate? I'd rather
die than eat airplane food.

631
01:16:10,263 --> 01:16:14,381
I'll write you're 12.
That way you can fly unaccompanied.

632
01:16:14,543 --> 01:16:20,857
- Who'd believe I'm 12?
- They'll believe the computer.

633
01:16:21,023 --> 01:16:26,256
I'll say you're short for your age,
but that they shouldn't mention it.

634
01:16:26,423 --> 01:16:28,573
Great idea!

635
01:16:48,023 --> 01:16:51,732
- You'll miss the train.
- No I won't.

636
01:16:51,903 --> 01:16:57,182
I'm so happy, Becky.
This is right. It's real.

637
01:16:57,343 --> 01:17:02,292
The other things happen in movies.

638
01:17:02,463 --> 01:17:06,342
Don't tell anyone what I did.
I'd die -

639
01:17:06,503 --> 01:17:12,658
- if anyone knew I did anything
like that. You promise?

640
01:17:12,823 --> 01:17:16,896
Sleepless in Seattle is history.

641
01:17:47,983 --> 01:17:51,055
- Go ahead.
- No, you go.

642
01:17:51,223 --> 01:17:55,296
I was going to say
that since Christmas -

643
01:17:55,463 --> 01:17:59,251
- you've been kind of distracted.

644
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:05,453
But now it feels as if you're coming
back from wherever you were.

645
01:18:05,623 --> 01:18:08,774
I am.

646
01:18:08,943 --> 01:18:14,734
I was just ...
I think I got nervous.

647
01:18:15,423 --> 01:18:22,022
But that's normal, right?
Don't you ever feel nervous ...

648
01:18:23,143 --> 01:18:27,898
- About what?
- Forever.

649
01:18:28,543 --> 01:18:31,580
No.

650
01:18:33,223 --> 01:18:37,774
Well ... I did.

651
01:18:37,943 --> 01:18:43,017
And I think I thought
it was too perfect.

652
01:18:43,183 --> 01:18:48,655
I was afraid we'd be to rights
making a wrong.

653
01:18:48,823 --> 01:18:55,342
You know. it was like kismet.
but not, if you see what I mean.

654
01:18:55,503 --> 01:19:00,293
You have to grow up and forget
the adolescent fantasies about -

655
01:19:00,463 --> 01:19:04,820
- how exciting life will be.
I'm sorry, but I love this pattern.

656
01:19:04,983 --> 01:19:09,534
You couldn't. This is just
like my grandmother's china.

657
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:14,015
- How many place settings?
- Ten.

658
01:19:16,023 --> 01:19:22,417
Exactly. Eight is too few,
twelve is too many.

659
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:48,740
- Walter ...
- It was my mother's.

660
01:19:49,663 --> 01:19:55,181
I had them size it down.
She had really fat fingers.

661
01:19:57,543 --> 01:20:01,616
It's so beautiful.
It's exactly what I'd pick -

662
01:20:01,783 --> 01:20:06,811
- if I had every ring
in the world to choose from.

663
01:20:07,783 --> 01:20:12,379
Some people want a relationship
to be full of surprises, -

664
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:16,616
- but I'm not one of them.

665
01:20:17,223 --> 01:20:21,614
Surprises are highly overrated.

666
01:20:22,503 --> 01:20:22,543
I'll only be gone one night.
Clarise will be here ...

667
01:20:22,543 --> 01:20:27,219
I'll only be gone one night.
Clarise will be here ...

668
01:20:27,383 --> 01:20:31,171
You can watch scary movies.

669
01:20:31,343 --> 01:20:36,053
- Are you going with her?
- I'm going with Victoria.

670
01:20:38,303 --> 01:20:41,773
Don't try anything tricky.

671
01:20:43,903 --> 01:20:50,172
Don't roll in poison ivy or
do anything so you need stitches.

672
01:20:50,343 --> 01:20:56,896
If your finger falls off, it stays
off. I won't take you to hospital.

673
01:20:57,783 --> 01:21:01,776
- Is this about that woman?
- Annie.

674
01:21:05,183 --> 01:21:09,335
- I don't care what you do!
- I'll tell you what I'm doing.

675
01:21:09,503 --> 01:21:15,260
I'm getting laid. I'm the only man
in the 90's who's getting laid.

676
01:21:15,423 --> 01:21:20,781
And I haven't been laid that much.
Six or seven girls at college.

677
01:21:20,943 --> 01:21:24,777
How long have you been there?
What did you hear me say?

678
01:21:24,943 --> 01:21:30,176
-"Six-seven girls at college."
- Seven ... Eight! Mary Kelly.

679
01:21:30,343 --> 01:21:34,302
This is the one I like.

680
01:21:34,463 --> 01:21:39,139
Jonah, you won't like any woman,
because it isn't your mother.

681
01:21:39,303 --> 01:21:44,377
- What's wrong with Annie?
- Jonah, shut up.

682
01:21:44,543 --> 01:21:50,300
Shut up? Mum never told me
to shut up or yelled at me.

683
01:21:50,463 --> 01:21:53,261
This conversation is over!

684
01:21:53,423 --> 01:21:59,737
This woman could be a sick lunatic.
Didn't you see "Fatal Attraction"?

685
01:21:59,903 --> 01:22:05,455
- You wouldn't let me.
- It scared every man in America.

686
01:22:07,383 --> 01:22:11,342
I'm not leaving till you say yes.

687
01:22:15,143 --> 01:22:17,293
I hate you!

688
01:22:17,463 --> 01:22:21,251
Good, then you can tell Oprah
how your dad ruined your life -

689
01:22:21,423 --> 01:22:25,416
- by going of for a weekend
special at the Holiday Inn!

690
01:22:39,343 --> 01:22:44,292
Jonah. Clarise is here
and I've got to go.

691
01:22:52,863 --> 01:22:58,460
Jonah. Listen.
I've got to go ...

692
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:30,340
Jessica. tell us where he is.
Jonah's dad is very upset.

693
01:23:30,503 --> 01:23:35,702
Jessica, this is your father.
Tell us where he is.

694
01:23:37,503 --> 01:23:40,700
- N-Y.
- That means "no way".

695
01:23:40,863 --> 01:23:43,616
That's N-W!

696
01:23:43,783 --> 01:23:48,777
- He's on his way to New York.
- How?

697
01:23:48,943 --> 01:23:51,855
United. 597.

698
01:23:52,023 --> 01:23:55,538
- When does it leave?
- 7:30.

699
01:24:01,223 --> 01:24:05,501
Here's a pin for flying with us.

700
01:24:05,663 --> 01:24:09,292
- Can I take this for you?
- No.

701
01:24:23,063 --> 01:24:26,897
- Where to. kid?
- Empire State Building.

702
01:24:27,063 --> 01:24:31,215
- Empire State Building.
- Don't stop so close to the curb.

703
01:24:33,143 --> 01:24:38,137
There it is. What are you going
to do up there? Spit off the top?

704
01:24:38,303 --> 01:24:41,375
No, I'm meeting my new mother.

705
01:25:00,703 --> 01:25:06,414
- I'm Jonah. Are you Annie?
- No, I'm Cynthia.

706
01:25:12,503 --> 01:25:16,542
Excuse me, are you Annie?

707
01:25:51,863 --> 01:25:54,855
Great table. Thanks.

708
01:25:56,023 --> 01:25:58,776
Is something wrong?

709
01:25:58,943 --> 01:26:02,822
- Can I get you a drink?
- Champagne?

710
01:26:02,983 --> 01:26:05,451
Fine.

711
01:26:05,623 --> 01:26:09,662
We'll have a bottle of Dom DeLuise.

712
01:26:11,943 --> 01:26:16,733
- Just kidding.
- He meant Dom Perignon.

713
01:26:18,903 --> 01:26:21,895
Beautiful view.

714
01:26:22,063 --> 01:26:26,420
Walter ...
There's something I must tell you.

715
01:26:40,463 --> 01:26:43,614
Sorry, an emergency.

716
01:26:43,783 --> 01:26:47,742
Money, money, money, see?

717
01:28:00,063 --> 01:28:04,818
So he could be on top of
the Empire State Building now?

718
01:28:04,983 --> 01:28:10,455
No. I guess he could be ... No.

719
01:28:11,063 --> 01:28:16,820
It's not him. Walter. It's me.
I can't do this.

720
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:25,062
Annie, I love you.
But let's leave that out of this.

721
01:28:25,983 --> 01:28:32,502
I don't want to be someone that you
or anybody else settles for.

722
01:28:34,423 --> 01:28:39,656
Marriage is hard enough
without such low expectations.

723
01:28:39,823 --> 01:28:44,180
- Isn't it?
- Walter, I don't deserve you.

724
01:28:44,983 --> 01:28:48,692
No, I wouldn't put it that way.

725
01:28:48,863 --> 01:28:52,742
But ... okay.

726
01:29:06,583 --> 01:29:12,215
- You okay?
- Yeah.

727
01:29:15,423 --> 01:29:18,540
- What?
- Look.

728
01:29:25,743 --> 01:29:29,622
- It's a sign.
- Who needed a sign?

729
01:29:29,783 --> 01:29:33,537
Walter, I have to go.

730
01:29:46,063 --> 01:29:49,100
Jonah!

731
01:29:51,623 --> 01:29:54,535
Dad!

732
01:30:07,183 --> 01:30:11,222
What if something happened to you?
What if I couldn't get to you?

733
01:30:11,383 --> 01:30:15,535
I'm sorry.

734
01:30:16,143 --> 01:30:21,342
What would I have done?
You're my family. You're all I have.

735
01:30:21,503 --> 01:30:24,017
I thought she'd be here.

736
01:30:24,183 --> 01:30:29,132
We're doing okay, right?
So far, have I done anything stupid?

737
01:30:29,303 --> 01:30:34,093
- Have I screwed it up for us?
- No.

738
01:31:23,223 --> 01:31:27,614
- Observation deck?
- Sorry, it's too late.

739
01:31:27,783 --> 01:31:33,096
- Please. I need to get up there.
- We're closing up.

740
01:31:37,663 --> 01:31:43,420
Can I just take a look?
I'm supposed to meet someone.

741
01:31:43,583 --> 01:31:48,373
He's probably not there, but if
I don't look, I'll always wonder.

742
01:31:48,543 --> 01:31:52,582
- Cary Grant, right?
- You know that movie?

743
01:31:52,743 --> 01:31:56,531
It's one of my wife's favourites.

744
01:32:03,183 --> 01:32:07,574
Maybe when we get home
we'll get a dog.

745
01:32:07,743 --> 01:32:13,295
- Wouldn't you like to have a dog?
- Sure.

746
01:32:24,703 --> 01:32:28,821
I'm sorry, ma'am. Empty.

747
01:32:29,703 --> 01:32:34,902
- Can I take a minute?
- Go ahead.

748
01:33:44,823 --> 01:33:48,532
I left it by the telescopes.

749
01:34:12,623 --> 01:34:18,061
It's you.
I saw you in the street.

750
01:34:18,223 --> 01:34:22,375
- Are you Annie?
- Yes.

751
01:34:25,063 --> 01:34:28,453
You're Annie?

752
01:34:29,423 --> 01:34:33,416
- This must be yours.
- I'm Jonah.

753
01:34:33,583 --> 01:34:38,293
- This is my dad. His name is Sam.
- Hi. Jonah.

754
01:34:39,263 --> 01:34:42,016
Sam ...

755
01:34:45,063 --> 01:34:49,898
- And who's this?
- Howard.

756
01:35:04,703 --> 01:35:08,173
We'd better go.

757
01:35:13,183 --> 01:35:16,095
Shall we?

758
01:35:59,663 --> 01:36:03,815
Sam ... It's nice to meet you.
