高速追击途中

州警那说了一堆话

但听上去好像控制住了

调度 我要送这家伙去哪

Not sure what's left of it after the fire.

25
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,000

I think they're moving, but they're still listed on duty.

26
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,200

53
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,310
天知道
Who knows.

54
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,380
我在这做什么都不被允许
They won't let me do anything around here.

55
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,690
这个不错
Oh, here's a good one.

56
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,560
去颏套
De-gloving.

57
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,490
这有张图
There's a picture.

58
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,660
天呐
Ugh, Jesus.

59
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,830
统计学上来讲 相比其他地方
You know, statistically, you're more likely to die

60
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,470
你更可能死在医院
in a hospital than anywhere else.

61
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,370
太好了
Cool.

62
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,800
我能给你根导管
Well, I could give you a catheter.

63
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:10,840
会挺有意思
That could be fun.

64
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,340
你是护士吗
Are you even a nurse?

65
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,480
我在接受培训
I am in training.

66
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,390
太好了
That's so cool.

67
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,680
我要睡觉了 好吗
How about I'm just gonna go to sleep, okay?

68
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,680
反正我要走了
I should go anyway.

69
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,320

晚安
Goodnight.

71
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,770
你挺会隆重登场啊 小丹尼
well, you sure know how to make an entrance, Danny boy.

72
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,540
是啊

73
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,240
感觉怎么样 玛吉
How you feeling, Maggie?

74
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,410
我一直有些疼
I've been having some pains.

75
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,250
鲍威尔医生说孩子可能要出生了
Dr. Powell says the baby might be on it's way.

76
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,450
没错 她肯定在里面猛踢
Yup, she's kicking up a storm in there that's for sure.

77
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,220
总之
Anyhow.

78
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,420
我很高兴医生还在
I'm just glad the doc stuck around.

79
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,690
那场火灾对这地方造成了很大损失
That fire really did a number on this place.

80
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,490
每次那孩子一躁动
And I can't afford to be driving her into the city

81
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,820
就开她去城里 我可吃不消
every time that kid gets fidgety.

82
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,280
消停会儿吧 爷爷
Give it a rest, grandad.

83
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,290
放开我
Let go of me!

84
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,240
- 住手  - 冷静
- Stop! - Calm down.

85
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,450
冷静
Calm down.

86
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,960
- 马上好  - 放开我
- One more second. - Let go of me!

87
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,910
- 住手  - 马上就好
- Stop! - Just one more second.

88
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,610
放松 呼吸
Easy. Breathe.

89
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,820
好了
Okay.

90
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,150
这场面我可不会记着
I'm not gonna miss this.

91
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,850
你能搞定他吧 理查德
You gonna be able to handle him, Richard?

92
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,220
你这朋友遭受了不小的创伤
Your friend here's had quite a trauma.

93
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,160
我们没身份辨识手环了
Well, not that we have any ID bracelets left, but for

94
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,590
但证件表明他叫詹姆斯
the record his name is James.

95
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,860
他有多糟
How bad is he?

96
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,560
他很不配合
Well, he's not been very cooperative.

97
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,530
镇定剂有助于我们查明
The sedative will help us determine exactly what his

98
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:48,700
他到底是什么状况 但我们这里的资源有限
condition is, but our resources are limited here.

99
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,300
所有东西都被打包准备搬走了
Everything's been packed up for the move.

100
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,940
看来这个詹姆斯对针头并不陌生
Looks like James here isn't any stranger to needles.

101
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,780
你在哪发现这家伙的
Where'd you find this guy?

102
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,280
他的血他妈流到我身上了
He fucking bled on me.

103
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,190
金 我知道被转来
Kim, I know getting transferred over here

104
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,250
不是你的首选 但你该
wasn't your first choice, but you're supposed to be

105
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,920
把文件装箱
boxing up files.

106
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,790
不用 现在有种东西叫电脑
No, there are things called computers now.

107
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,460
电脑能把文件放进箱子?
Can computers put files in boxes?

108
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,500
谢谢你咯
Thank you!

109
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,470
真老派
So old school.

110
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,850
要去除血渍
You might need something a little stronger

111
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,550
你就得用更强效点的
if you're gonna get that stain out.

112
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,860
无所谓了 该死的
Whatever, fuck.

113
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,260
我能用洗衣机洗
I can do my own laundry.

114
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,930
瞧你那样
Well! Look at you.

115
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,670
我给你带了咖啡
Brought you uh, coffee.

116

太好了
Nice.

00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,010
我之前想要来着
I was looking for that.

118
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,440
它现在是我的 所以别有任何想法
It's mine now so don't you get any ideas.

119
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,840
是啊
Right.

120
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,250

见到你 我很高兴
It's good to see you.

122
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,030
不好意思
Uh... I'm sorry.

123
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,390
我打断你们了吗
Am I interrupting something?

124
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,830
- 没有  - 没有
- No, no. - No. No, no, no.

125
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,030
我正想去确认下贝弗没杀掉我的实习生
I'm just gonna go make sure bev hasn't murdered my intern.τгаηslаτed ьγ ωeiьо-Eмτee

126
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,800
回见
I'll see you.

127
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,870
我们的来客暂时昏迷着
Our guest is out for now.

128
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,740
他伤得不严重 但你要过一段时间
He's not badly hurt, but it will be a while before

129
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,310
才能和他谈话
you can talk to him.

130
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,850
该死
Fuck.

131
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,650
你应该温柔对待艾莉森
You should be gentle with Alison.

132
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,790
她还要面对所遭遇的事
She's still coming to terms with what happened.

133
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,550
没错 好的
Yeah, okay.

134
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,720
丹尼尔 你知道没什么比
As you know Daniel, there's nothing worse than

135
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,290
失去孩子更糟
losing a child.

136
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,700
失去莎拉那会儿 我一团糟
When we lost Sarah, i was a mess.

137
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,370
很久才重新振作
It took a long time to come back from that.

138
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,470
你一定要往前看
You just have to keep going.

139
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,700
没错
Yeah.

贝弗莉
Beverly.

143
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,560
怎么了
What?

144
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,790
天啊
Jesus Christ.

145
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,640
你他妈在干什么 贝弗

166
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,620
金 你不必看这个
Kim, you don't need to see this.

167
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,990

你得放松下
No, you need to take it easy.

192
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,710
已经有一名州警到这了
There's a state trooper already here.

193
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,180
什么

194
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
天呐 我昏迷多久了

不久 显然他早就上路了
Not long.Apparently, he was already on his way.

Something to do with that kid you brought in.Look, it's not important right now.

197
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,160
这州警大概会想和你谈谈
This trooper's probably gonna wanna talk to you.

198
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,630
我们应该考虑把你转进病房
We should see about moving you to a room.

199
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,500
不用
No, no, no.

200

你刚经历了一件极度创伤性事件

你现在就像你父亲那样固执

听说他俩是一起被你发现的
They told me you found the two of them together.

213
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,390

215
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,000

216
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,430
你到这怎么这么快

你那个在隔壁病房的人
Your guy in the other room.

218
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:04,960
他怎么了
What about him?

219
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,110
这里以北约20英里 有场大血洗
We got a major bloodbath about twenty miles north of here.

220
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,980
他把那地方当成屠宰店大杀特杀
Looks like he tore the place up like a butcher shop.

221
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,380

225
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,650
你们护士应该已有所发现

我暂时把他铐在了床上
I've got him cuffed to the bed for the time being.

227
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,390
他已经失去知觉了
He's been out cold.

228
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,560

卡特 你爸是个可靠的警察
You know, Carter, your dad was a stand up cop.

I wonder what he'd think if he saw this shit show.

234
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,250
好了 我们得统计所有人
Okay, we need to make sure everybody's accounted for.

We should've been out of here already.

434
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,980
你们这些人得醒醒了
You people need to wake up.

435
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,250
不然呢
Or what?

436
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:50,460
外面要是有另一个那样的东西
You think you'll stand a chance if there's another

437
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,190
你们觉得你们跑得掉?
one of those things out there?

438
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:52,930
- 好吧 - 跑得掉吗
- Okay. - Will you, huh?

439
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:55,990
- 好吧  - 谁能阻止它 爷爷?
- Okay, okay. - Who's gonna stop it? Grandpa?

440
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,930
十几岁的浪货?
The teenage fucking slut?

441
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,330
来啊
Oh! Come on now!

442
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,230
别这样
Come on.

443
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,400
我们会死的
We're gonna die.

444
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,870
不会 我们不会死
No, we're not gonna die.

445
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,780
你们会死
You're gonna die.

446
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,070
我不会让这种事发生
I'm not gonna let that happen.

447
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,850
好吧
Okay.

448
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,520
我不知道你他妈想干嘛
I don't know what the fuck you think you're trying to do.

449
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,120
- 冷静 好吗 - 他在扰乱她 这可不好
- Okay? Just calm down. - He's upsetting her and that is not good.

450
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,590
- 我要你保持冷静  - 好的
- I need you to stay calm. - Okay.

451
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:25,060
能告诉我那边什么情况吗
Can you please tell me what is going on over there?

452
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,230
她还在宫缩
Her contractions are still spread out, but she's

453
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,460
但她腹痛 这不是好征兆
having abdominal pain which is a bad sign.

454
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,300
好吧 我不懂这是什么意思
Okay, I don't know what that means.

455
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,430
- 这是什么意思 - 意思是我们不能转移她
- What does that mean? - That means that we can't move her.

456
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,400
那会让情况恶化
It can make things much worse.

457
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,500
此外 在这过程中
Also the last thing I need is to be performing a

458
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:42,170
我要施行剖腹产 但这里没我
cesarean in the middle of this, but I have nothing

459
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:45,180
能用来帮她的 我什么都不做 孩子就会死
here to help her and if I don't do anything the baby could die.

460
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,280
我得去药房
I need to go to the med supply room.

461
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,110
我要去
So I'll go.

462
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,580
一个人? 不行 不可能
Alone? No, no, no, that's out of the question.

463
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,350
我可不是在请求
I'm not asking.

464
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,450
我们现在得处理这事
We need to handle this now.

465
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,320
好吧
Alright.

466
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,430
好了 听着 我们不知道外面有什么
Okay, look.We have no idea what is out there.

467
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,360
我们没法保护自己
We have no way of defending ourselves.

468
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,530
另外  现在有两个疯子
Plus these two fucking psychos now think that

469
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,630
把我们当人质
we're hostage.

470
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,270
我要去
I'm doing this.

471
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,940
不行...
You're not. You're not. You're not even...

472
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,340
如果这是因为我们的孩子 那你得做个
If this is because of the baby then you need to get

473
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,570
该死的心理检查
a fucking mental check.

474
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:18,210
天呐 这和我们的事无关
Jesus Christ, this is not about us.

475
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:21,580
那姑娘 她要是遭受胎盘早剥
That girl, if she suffers an abruption

476
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,250
她的孩子就会死
then her baby will die.

477
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:26,120
把孩子弄出来 我不用
If I try to take it out of her, and I don't use

478
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,990
麻醉剂 她就会休克而死
anesthetic then she could die of shock.

479
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,960
丹尼尔 看着我
Daniel, look at me.

480
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:37,430
好吧 该死的
Okay, fine. Fuck it, fuck it.

481
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,400
好吧 但你不能一个人去
Okay, but you're not going alone.

482
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,040
你得保证 然后等我 好吗 你保证?
You have to promise and wait for me, okay? You promise?

483
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,340
- 保证 - 好的
- Okay. - Alright.

484
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,180
我能提议吗
May I approach?

485
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,450
那姑娘的情况不乐观 孩子也是
The girl's not doing well and neither is the baby so

486
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:06,020
我们得去弄些东西来帮她
we need to go and get some things to help her.

487
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,560
你想要我们干嘛
What do you want from us?

488
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,730
我的巡逻车里有霰弹枪
Well I have a shotgun in my cruiser.

489
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:12,990
还有弹药
I have ammunition.

490
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,840
我们刚一路血战进来
We just fought our way in here.

491
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,570
我不会再出去
I'm not gonna just stroll back out again.

492
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:24,480
好吧 在我看来 我们的处境都一样
Okay, but as far as I can tell we're all the same boat.

493
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,210
你的步枪没子弹了
You've got a rifle without any bullets and a couple

494
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:29,780
还两把该死的消防斧
of fucking fire axes.

495
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,890
车很近 我们的动作能迅速点
I just...It's close and we can do it fast.

496
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,990
好吧 但我们不是为你们冒生命危险
Alright, but we're not risking our lives for you.

497
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,660
我们拿到枪 枪就是我们的
We get that gun, it's ours.

498
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,570
绝对是
Oh, absolutley.

499
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,690
绝对他妈是
Abso-fucking-lutley.

500
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,570
好
Okay.

501
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,220
你说很近的
I thought you said it was close.

502
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,090
什么情况
What the hell?

503
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,090
还在外面
It's still out there.

504
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,830
是的 但他们在等什么
Yeah, but what are they waiting for?

505
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,830
我们速去速回
Let's just make this quick.

506
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,900
霰弹枪被锁在前座
Shotgun's locked on the front seat.

507
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,060
我得开锁 不过...
I gotta release it, but...

508
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:29,110
弹药在后备箱
You get all the ammo out of the trunk.

509
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:36,080
别耍小聪明
Don't get any bright ideas.

510
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,850
嘿 等下
Hey, hold up.

511
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,720
该死的
God damnit.

512
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,820
他们回不来怎么办
What if they don't come back?

513
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,590
丹尼尔有数的
Daniel knows what he's doing.

514
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:51,960
没事的
It's alright.

515
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,300
我现在根本不该在这里
I shouldn't even be here right now.

516
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,570
我应该在莱克兰给病人翻身
I should be at lakeland turning over patients.

517
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:59,200
这地方真该死
Fuck this place.

518
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,870
金 你现在和我们困在一起 所以面对现实吧
Well, you're stuck with us now, Kim, so deal with it.

519
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,280
你怎么样了 亲爱的
How you doing, honey?

520
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,110
很疼
It hurts.

521
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:12,820
我的孩子会怎么样
What's gonna happen to my baby?

522
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,020
听我说
Listen to me.

523
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,230
你和你的孩子不会有事
You and your baby are going to be fine.

524
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,200
我向你保证
You have my word.

525
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,170
见鬼
Shit.

526
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,770
该死
Fuck.

527
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,210
你他妈搞什么呢
What the fuck are you doing in there?

528
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,420
你他妈怎么回事
What the fuck's going on in there?

529
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,060
见鬼
Ah, shit.

530
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,260
好了 时间到了
K, time's up.

531
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,160
我们该走了
That's our cue to leave.

532
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,140
快点 该死的
Come on, god damnit!

533
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,310
天呐
Fuck's sake!

534
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,450
快点
Fucking hurry up!

535
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
小心
Look out!

536
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,790
枪我拿
I'm keeping the fucking gun.

537
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,270
这地方挡不住任何进犯
This place isn't gonna keep anything out.

538
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,350
天啊
Oh my god.

539
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,140
嘿
Hey.

540
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,180
该死
Fuck.

541
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:54,770
出什么事了
What happened?

542
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,250
给
Here, here.

543
00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:00,320
- 艾莉呢 - 她去给玛吉拿药了
- Where's Allie? - Well she went to get some medicine for Maggie.

544
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,820
哪
Where?

545
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,750
药房
The med room.

546
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,860
天啊
Jesus Christ.

547
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,060
她说这里面没什么好担心的
She said there wasn't anything to worry about inside.

548
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,430
你们在不在同一栋楼里啊
Are you guys in the same fucking building?

549
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,160
你能在这里看好他们吗
Would you please wait here, look after them?

550
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:15,000
先生 不好意思 你能跟我走吗
Excuse me, sir, would you mind following me?

551
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,300
谢谢了
Thank you.

552
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,770
那孩子不会有事
That kid will be fine.

553
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,740
他经历过更糟的事
He's been through a lot worse.

554
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,210
那些人杀了他的家人
Those people killed his family.

555
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,410
我勉强才把他救了出来
I barely got him out of there alive.

556
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:29,080
你是什么来头 神秘男子
Yeah, what about you, man of mystery?

557
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,950
管好你自己的事
Mind your own business.

558
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:34,850
对了 她一个人走开太傻了
And by the way, pretty stupid to go running off by herself.

559
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:37,190
好吧 我非常肯定你能揍扁我
Okay, I'm pretty certain you can beat the shit out

560
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,120
但我认为我才是有权
of me, but I consider it my special privilege to

561
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:42,270
责备我妻子的人 所以请你给我闭嘴
hate my wife right now so if you could kindly shut the fuck up.

562
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,120
这是米切尔的枪
This is Mitchell's gun.

563
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,100
看
Look.

564
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,160
怎么了
What?

565
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,940
你好 丹尼尔
Hello, Daniel.

566
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,080
这是谁
Who is this?

567
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:47,450
你看到了...
You saw...

568
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,050
一些东西
Something.

569
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,960
你醒来时 我就感觉到了
I felt it when you woke up.

570
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,990
但那是什么呢
But what was it?

571
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,000
你愿意的话 我能向你展现更多
I can show you more if you'd like.

572
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,570
嗨 理查德
Hi, Richard.

573
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:10,210
我肯定这对你来说很难理解
I'm sure it's hard for you to understand.

574
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:17,420
贝弗莉也是 但我向你保证
Beverly found it difficult as well, but I assure you

00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,100
金
Kim!

717
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:22,940
- 怎么走 - 停尸间的门应该就在你们前方
- Where are we going? - The door to the morgue should be right there in front of you.

718
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:34,080
我没看到门 只有过道
I don't see any door. Just a bunch of corridors.

719
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:36,550
你确定这地方没错?
You sure this is the right place?

720
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,190
他走错楼梯了
He went down the wrong stairs.

721
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:40,090
只有一段楼梯
There's only one set of stairs.

722
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:42,060
我知道他们要去哪
I know where they're going.

723
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,030
有人吗
Hello?

724
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,230
卡特
Carter!

725
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:51,100
最好别把我们带进陷阱
Better not be leading us into a trap.

726
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:57,980
怎么了
What's going on?

727
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,880
开什么玩笑
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

728
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:08,320
你找到了?
Did you find it?

729
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,290
是不是有下层地下室...
Is there some kind of sub-basement or...

730
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:14,160
没 你在说什么
No, no, no, what are you talking about?

731
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,630
- 有一段下去的楼梯  - 什么
- A staircase going down. - What?

732
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:30,210
卡特 听得到吗
Carter, can you hear me?

733
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,360
我们得回去
We gotta go back.

734
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,930
我不能叫你跟我下去
I can't ask you to follow me down here.

735
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:50,590
明白吗
You understand?

736
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:54,360
伙计们 怎么了
Guys, what's happening?

737
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,500
没怎么 我们...
Nothing. We're...

738
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:02,970
我们要下去
We're gonna go down the stairs.

739
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,410
嘿 让他带路
Hey, leading in with him.

740
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,280
嘿 你先走
Hey, you get to go first.

741
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,620
没错
Yeah, right.

742
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,220
这不是请求
I'm not asking.

743
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,420
安静
Be quiet.

744
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:46,180
别费心了
Don't bother.

745
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,250
你动不了
You won't be able to move.

746
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,090
什么 理查德?
What? Richard?

747
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:57,060
耐心点
Be patient.

748
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,560
我快准备好了
I'm almost ready.

749
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,660
什么情况
What- what- what is this?

750
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:03,630
我看见你死了
I saw you die.

751
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:09,410
我不知道那会是这种感觉
I had no idea that it would feel like this.

752
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:12,680
多年来 我给人做手术
The years I spent operating on people.

753
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:16,240
切开再缝合
Opening them up and stitching them back together again.

754
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,650
非常棒 那感觉...
It's remarkable, the sensation it's...

755
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:25,190
并不疼 而更是种解脱
Not pain, more a sense of release.

756
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:27,560
你为什么...
Why, why are you- -

757
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,030
请安静
be quiet, please.

758
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:31,800
这是个未知领域
This is uncharted territory.

759
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:37,400
是个研究自我转变的机会
The chance to study my own transformation.

760
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,410
我理解你的迟疑 艾莉森 但
I understand your hesitation, Allison, but

761
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:45,280
我问问你 这些年来 你有没
let me ask you, all these years, haven't you ever

762
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,210
想救活一个无法救活的人
wished to save someone beyond saving?

763
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:51,550
无论代价是什么
No matter what the costs?

764
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:56,150
失去莎拉 把我毁了
Well, losing Sarah destroyed me.

765
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:02,360
但也迫使我找到了解决办法
But it also compelled me to find a solution.

766
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:10,500
你有所寻求时 你会对你发现的东西感到惊叹
You'd be surprised at the things you find when you go looking.

767
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:24,210
气味像墓地
It smells like a grave.

768
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:38,400
我以前见过这场景
I've seen this place before.

769
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,260
是在我们清理的那栋房子里
This was all over the house we cleaned out.

770
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:42,700
他让我们看东西
He made us look at things.

771
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:45,840
那是我见过的最糟的东西
The worst things I've ever seen.

772
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:50,310
我们在那地方的地下室房间里发现全是尸体
We found rooms full of bodies in the basement of that place.

773
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:54,790
一个人被弄在桌子上 就像在被手术
They had someone on a table like they were doing surgery down there.

774
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:56,210
有一半转变成了那种东西
Half turned into one of those things.

775
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:56,880
不是
No!

776
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,720
比那更糟
No, worse than that.

777
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,970
就像一场噩梦
Like a nightmare.

778
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,290
这不是真的
It isn't real.

779
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:08,860
这不是真的
It's not real.

780
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:20,570
这是个老鼠迷宫
It's a rat's maze.

781
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:24,710
卡特
Carter!

782
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,910
他在这吗
Is he here?

783
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:30,310
嘿
Hey!

784
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,780
在啊
Yeah.

785
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:35,550
他把我带过来...孩子
He has took me here to... baby.

786
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:36,490
我就在这 孩子
I'm right here, kiddo.

787
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:38,420
会好的 没事的
It's okay, it's alright.

788
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,360
你会没事的
You're gonna be fine.

789
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,430
你很幸运 你爷爷很关心你
You're lucky your grandpa cares about you so much.

790
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:46,600
我爷爷只会对电视大吼 一直抽烟
My grandpa just yells at his TV and smokes.

791
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:51,600
- 帮帮她 - 见鬼 好的 等下
- Help her, help her. - Shit, okay, okay! Wait, wait.

792
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,200
请帮帮她
Help her, please.

793
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:55,340
- 可待因  - 好的
- The codeine, I think. - Alright.

794
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,770
好了 玛吉 坚持会儿
Okay, Maggie, hold still for one second.

795
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,510
有这个 好了
I got this. Okay.

796
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:00,880

I'm gonna give you something that's really

797
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,310
帮到你
gonna help you.

798
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:03,810
你就不会疼了
It's gonna feel really good.

799
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,250
- 你表现得很棒  - 没事的
- You're doing real good. - It's alright, it's alright.

800
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,620
- 好了  - 不疼的
- Okay. - It's gonna be real painless.

801
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:08,220
马上就好了
It's gonna be okay in a second.

802
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,790
- 好的  - 马上好
- Okay, okay. - Just give me a second.

803
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:11,390
好了
Okay, okay.

804
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:13,190
好吧 你得抱她依然
Okay, you gotta hold her still.

805
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:13,790
你别让她乱动
You gotta hold her still.

806
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:18,400
我一注射 你就放松 好吗
Easy, once I get this in. Okay, ready?

807
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,630
打针咯
There you go.

808
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:23,500
很好
Yeah, yeah.

809
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,700
没事的
It's okay.

810
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:27,970
没问题的
There's no problem. No problem.

811
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:52,230
译者:微博@Emtee

812
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,530
很好
Great.

813
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,240
我不会进去的
I'm not going in there.

814
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,840
开枪打我吧
Fucking shoot me.

815
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:13,350
嘿
Hey.

816
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,260
就是这个
This is it.

817
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,520
就是什么
This is what?

818
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:26,630
我欣赏你的热忱 但我们得好好想想
I appreciate your enthusiasm but we need to think this through.

819
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:45,980
这是个错误
This is a mistake.

820
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,530
过来 小混球
Come here, you little fuck.

821
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:01,400
你知道你死后会去哪吗
Do you know where you go when you die?

822
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:03,700
我知道
I do.

823
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:07,670
你的行程会继续 会重生为别的东西
You travel on, reborn into something else, like a

824
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:09,710
就像毛毛虫变成蛾
caterpillar becoming a moth.

825
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:13,510
到现在为止 我只能追踪在虫茧里的蛾
Until now I've only been able to track the moth in its cocoon.

826
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:15,880
当然身体必须进行调整
The body has to adjust, of course.

827
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,080
以来适应
It adapts.

828
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,820
我们生来并不是这种东西
We weren't built for this kind of thing.

829
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:26,960
我承认 早期我犯了错误
I admit, early on i made mistakes.

830
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,360
其中有些错误还和我们在这下面
Some of those earliest mistakes are still down here with us.

831
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,030
事实上是他们引起了毁掉这家医院的火灾
In fact, they caused the fire that destroyed this hospital.

832
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:44,810
瞧 他们想死 但我不准
You see, they want to die, but I won't let them.

833
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,450
别哭泣 艾莉森
Don't cry, Allison.

834
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:51,010
我要帮助你
I am going to help you.

835
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:55,920
这是生死轮回的终结
This is an end to the cycle of life and death.

836
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,240
你真的想要这样的世界吗
Do you really want this world?

837
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,080
想要这个夺走你儿子的世界?
This world that took your son from you?

838
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,250
你知道那晚你未出生的孩子怎么回事吗
Do you know what happened that night to your unborn child?

839
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:04,430
别这样
No, please.

840
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:06,530
脐带缠在一起了
Umbilical cord became entangled.

841
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:09,470
就这么简单 很奇怪 对吗
Simple as that. Strange, isn't it?

842
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:12,070
你和你孩子之间的生命线
The very lifeline between you and your child,

843
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:15,470
在他挣扎着想出来时 就如套着他颈部的绞索在收紧
constricting like a noose around his neck as he struggled to get out.

844
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:20,600
越收越紧 直到他最终无法挣扎为止
Tighter and tighter until finally it couldn't struggle anymore.

845
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:23,450
大自然的无用之举
Nature's futility.

846
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:25,270
我能制止它
I can stop it.

847
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:28,850
这是真正有意义的第一步
This is the first real step.

848
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:32,620
真正意义上的复活
The true resurrection.

849
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:41,700
我失去了我女儿 她去了阴间 但今晚
I lost my daughter to the abyss, but tonight, I am

850
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,400
我要复活她
calling her back.

851
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,800
理查德
Richard.

852
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,740
别这样
Please.

853
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,910
别这么做
Don't do this.

854
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,720
但已经完成了
But it's already done.

855
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,590
你很漂亮 艾莉森
You are so beautiful, Allison.

856
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,530
你会变得非同凡响
You will become something truly remarkable.

857
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,930
这是个屠宰场
This is a slaughter house.

858
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:50,670

我本该在那栋房子里杀了你

看看周围
Look around us, huh?

我们要你和我们在一起
We need you with us.

874

他在他的脑海里
He's in his head!

875

他在他的脑海里
He's in his head!

876
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:55,830
住手
Stop it!

877
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:20,960
我们是在地狱
We're in hell.

878
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:40,710
别让她乱动
You've got to hold her still!

879
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,720
不会有事的

是前门
That's the front entrance!

881
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,200

做你必须做的

我要把那些混蛋赶出去

我怕失手害死她

896
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:48,870
终于是时候了

897

你怎么能这样
How could you?

898
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:53,410
你的孩子
Your baby.

899
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:56,810
鲍威尔医生是个伟大的人

我很幸运怀着他的孩子

现在其他都无关紧要了

902
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:18,770

Don't worry.

903
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:22,270
一切都即将改变
Everything is about to change.

904
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:24,310

我从你脸上看出来了

我拒绝让死亡成为终结

世上有更为古老的存在

970

你得为我而死...

就如你之前的父亲和儿子

看着阴间向我敞开吧

这由世间一切所导致

991

我能看透我面前的一切

无限运转的异界

别反抗了 丹尼尔
Don't fight it, Daniel.
