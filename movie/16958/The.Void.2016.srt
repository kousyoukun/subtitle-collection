3
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,480
他走不了多远的
He won't get far.

4
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,620
救命
Help.

5
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,980
你还醒着吗？
You still awake?

6
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,690
还在巡查中
In the middle of a high speed chase.

7
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,820
这是很关键的
This better be important.

8
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,990
有你在那边，我就放心了
I just feel so good knowing you're out there

9
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,860
你一直都让我们有安全感
keeping us safe.

10
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,760
你那边怎么样？
And yours on your end?

11
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,700
那些州际警察一直叨叨个不停，但是
There's a mess of chatter from state police, but it

12
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,530
看起来他们管理得还不错
sounds like they got it under control.

13
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,940
不管怎么样，你的任务快结束了，你来这儿就能见到我们了
Anyway, you're about up so we'll see you when you get in.

14
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,010
好的
Okay.

15
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,710
等等
Hold on.

16
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,550
看起来我好像发现一个...
Looks like I got some kind of a...

17
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,550
醉醺醺的年轻人
Drunk teenager.

18
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,850
我不知道
I don't know.

19
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,690
嘿！
Hey!

20
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,320
嘿，伙计，你知道你这样
Hey, buddy, you know it's a little cold to be

21
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,430
一路爬回家会冻着的
crawling all the way home.

22
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,900
准备行动
Stand by.

23
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,340
漫漫长夜，嗯哼？
Big night, huh?

24
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,520
我的天呐
Holy shit.

25
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,760
分部，我该把这家伙带到哪儿？
Dispatch, where am I taking this guy?

26
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,390
最近的急救站就在马什郡
Closest emergency services is still Marsh County.

27
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,720
但是我不确定那场火灾后它是否还在那儿，我觉得他们应该换地儿了
Not sure what's left of it after the fire.I think they're moving,

28
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,400
但是他们应该还在上班
but they're still listed on duty.

29
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,970
好吧，额，那莱克兰呢？
Okay, uh, how about lakeland?

30
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,970
到那儿至少得再花个20分钟
It's another twenty minutes at least.

31
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,870
你决定吧
It's your call.

32
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,440
好的，你先呼马什郡的吧
Okay, you call ahead to Marsh.

33
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,110
让他们知道带他去的人是我
Let them know it's me that's bringing him in.

34
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,410
你提前电话吧
You call ahead.

35
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,000
这里谁能帮我一下？
Can I get some help here?

36
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,830
额，贝弗，前面需要帮忙
Uh, Bev, I need hands up front.

37
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,070
拿一个担架过来
Bring a stretcher.

38
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,670
分部没有提前打电话吗？
Dispatch not call ahead?

39
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:48,670
什么？
What?

40
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,140
我们没接到电话
We didn't get a call.

41
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,940
贝弗！
Bev!

42
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,710
额，抓着他的脚可以吗？
Uh, wanna get his feet?

43
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,070
好的，我去抬他
Yup, I'll get him.

44
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,150
- 好的，一，二，三        -一，二，三
- Okay. One, two, three.     - One, two, three.

45
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,650
好的
Alright.

46
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,820
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

47
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,650
你能听见我说话吗？
Can you hear me?

48
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,020
他是什么情况，丹尼？
What's his story, Danny?

49
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,490
额，他在流血，贝弗
Uh, he's bleeding, Bev.

50
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:09,490
我们会好好照顾你的
We're gonna take care of you.

51
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,690
贝弗莉，我们得给他做个检查，带到鲍威尔医生那儿
Beverly, we gotta get him on a monitor and into Dr. Powell.

52
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,130
我们走吧
Let's go.

53
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,600
哦
Oh.

54
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,910
你好
Hi.

55
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,180
由于技术故障，在短暂休息之后
Coming back on the air after an

56
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,940
又重新回到了空中
interruption due to technical problems.

57
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,450
外面发生什么事儿了？
What's that about?

58
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,710
鬼知道
Who knows.

59
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,780
他们又不让我干别的
They won't let me do anything around here.

60
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,090
哦，这个不错
Oh, here's a good one.

61
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,960
皮肤脱套
Degloving.

62
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,890
看这个图片
There's a picture.

63
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,060
哦，天呐
Ugh, Jesus.

64
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,230
你知道，资料显示，你待在医院
You know, statistically,you're more likely to die

65
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,870
更容易死亡
in a hospital than anywhere else.

66
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,770
吓人
Cool.

67
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,200
额，我去给你拿导尿管
Well, I could give you a catheter.

68
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,240
那或许有点儿意思
That could be fun.

69
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,740
你是个护士吗？
Are you even a nurse?

70
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,880
我还在实习
I am in training.

71
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,080
真没意思，我能睡觉了吗？
That's so cool.How about I'm just gonna go to sleep, okay?

72
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,080
我也该走了
I should go anyway.

73
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,720
我猜你不需要这个了
I guess you won't be needing this.

74
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,560
晚安
Good night.

75
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,790
真是一团糟，额，你应该能及时把这些
All messed up.Well, uh, in time, would you say you ought to be

76
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,690
整理好
able to wrap this up

77
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,170
额，你清楚你自己是怎么进来的，丹尼小伙儿
well, you sure know how to make an entrance, Danny boy.

78
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,940
对
Yup.

79
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,640
你感觉怎么样，玛姬？
How you feeling, Maggie?

80
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,810
我感觉有些疼
I've been having some pains.

81
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,650
鲍威尔医生说孩子快要出生了
Dr. Powell says the baby might be on it's way.

82
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,850
恩，很确定的是她在肚子里活跃得很
Yup, she's kicking up a storm in there that's for sure.

83
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,820
无论如何，看到医生还在坚守岗位我真的很开心
Anyhow.I'm just glad the doc stuck around.

84
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,090
那场火灾真的让这个地方损失惨重
That fire really did a number on this place.

85
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,890
我可受不了把她带到市区了
And I can't afford to be driving her into the city

86
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,830
一到市区肚子里的孩子就来回乱动
every time that kid gets fidgety.

87
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,100
消停会儿吧，爷爷
Give it a rest, grandad.

88
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,640
- 放开我！住手！       -放轻松
- Let go of me!Stop!   -Calm down.

89
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,140
- 放轻松，只需一秒      -放开我！
- Calm down.One more second.   -Let go of me!

90
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,310
- 住手！            - 只需一秒
- Stop!    - Just one more second.

91
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,010
放轻松，深呼吸
Easy. Breathe.

92
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,220
好了
Okay.

93
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,550
我不在再想念这个的
I'm not gonna miss this.

94
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,250
你能治好他吗？理查德
You gonna be able to handle him, Richard?

95
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,620
你的朋友有外伤
Your friend here's had quite a trauma.

96
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,560
额，我们没有他的任何身份信息
Well, not that we have any ID bracelets left, but for

97
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,990
只有知道他叫詹姆士
the record his name is James.

98
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,260
他的情况多严重？
How bad is he?

99
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,960
额，他一点儿都不配合
Well, he's not been very cooperative.

100
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,930
镇定剂会帮我们，让我们知道
The sedative will help us determine exactly what his

101
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:35,100
他的情况怎么样了，但是我们的资源是有限的
condition is, but our resources are limited here.

102
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,700
做好一切转院的准备
Everything's been packed up for the move.

103
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,340
看起来詹姆士身上的针孔很奇怪
Looks like James here isn't any stranger to needles.

104
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,180
你在哪儿找到他的？
Where'd you find this guy?

105
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,680
他的血弄到我身上了
He fucking bled on me.

106
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,590
金，我知道把你调到这儿你很不乐意
Kim, I know getting transferred over here

107
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,650
但是你也应该
wasn't your first choice,but you're supposed to be

108
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,320
把这些文件整理好啊
boxing up files.

109
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,190
不，现在很多事电脑就能办到
No, there are things called computers now.

110
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,860
电脑能把文件放到箱子里吗？
Can computers put files in boxes?

111
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,900
谢谢你！
Thank you!

112
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,870
好旧的学校
So old school.

113
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,250
如果你想去掉血迹
You might need something a little stronger

114
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,950
你得找点儿更强效的东西
if you're gonna get that stain out.

115
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,260
管他呢，妈的
Whatever, fuck.

116
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,660
我可以洗干净
I can do my own laundry.

117
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,330
好吧！看看你
Well! Look at you.

118
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,070
给你拿了杯咖啡
Brought you uh, coffee.

119
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,010
好极了
Nice.

120
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,410
我正在找那个
I was looking for that.

121
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,840
现在我帮你找，你不用担心了
It's mine now so don't you get any ideas.

122
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,240
好吧
Right.

123
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,650
你真善良
You're being friendly.

124
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,090
很高兴认识你
It's good to see you.

125
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,430
额...抱歉
Uh... I'm sorry.

126
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,790
我是不是打扰到你们了？
Am I interrupting something?

127
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,230
- 不，不         - 不，不，不，不
-No, no.    -No. No, no, no.

128
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,430
我只是来确认一下贝弗没有杀了我的实习生
I'm just gonna go make sure Bev hasn't murdered my intern.

129
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,200
一会儿见
I'll see you.

130
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,270
我们的病人现在还在昏迷
Our guest is out for now.

131
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:22,140
他伤得不重，一会儿你就能
He's not badly hurt, but it will be a while before

132
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,710
和他谈谈了
you can talk to him.

133
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,250
该死
Fuck.

134
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,050
你应该对艾莉森温柔点儿
You should be gentle with Alison.

135
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,190
她处还在阴影期
She's still coming to terms with what happened.

136
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,950
恩，好的
Yeah, okay.

137
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,120
如你所知，丹尼尔，没有什么比失去孩子
As you know Daniel,there's nothing worse than

138
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,690
更痛苦了
losing a child.

139
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,100
当我们失去萨拉的时候，我心乱如麻
When we lost Sarah,I was a mess.

140
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,770
我花了好长时间才从那个阴影中走出来
It took a long time to come back from that.

141
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,870
你还得继续生活下去啊
You just have to keep going.

142
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,100
恩
Yeah.

143
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,480
贝弗莉
Beverly.

144
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,420
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

145
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,320
贝弗莉
Beverly.

146
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,960
什么鬼？
What?

147
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,190
天呐
Jesus Christ.

148
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,040
贝弗，你究竟在做什么？
What the fuck are you doing, Bev?

149
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,840
贝弗莉？
Beverly?

150
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,170
这不是我的脸
This isn't my face.

151
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,880
干什么？贝弗
What, Bev?

152
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,450
不，不要，别那样做
No, no, don't do that.

153
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,050
贝弗！
Bev!

154
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,180
把剪刀放下
Put the scissors down.

155
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,850
看着我！
Look at me!

156
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,350
贝弗，好了，住手！
Bev, okay, stop!

157
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,420
这不是我
It's not me.

158
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,530
不，不，不，别那样做
No, no, no, don't do that.

159
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,890
贝弗
Bev.

160
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,030
你能帮帮我吗？
Can you help me?

161
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,500
贝弗，贝弗，住手！
Bev, Bev, stop!

162
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,100
不，不，不！
No, no, no!

163
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,970
贝弗莉，住手！
Beverly, stop!

164
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,240
哦，该死
Oh, fuck.

165
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,150
丹尼尔！
Daniel!

166
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,880
丹尼尔，怎么了？
Daniel, what?

167
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,280
- 你做了什么？         - 究竟发生了什么？
- What did you do?     - What the fuck?

168
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,220
金，金，离开这儿
Kim. Kim, get out of here.

169
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,020
金，你不需要看到这个
Kim, you don't need to see this.

170
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,390
她杀了他，我，额...
She killed him.I, uh...

171
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,360
她想攻击我
She came at me.

172
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,830
她想攻击我，好吧
She came at me. Okay.

173
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,860
好了
Alright.

174
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,430
刚刚那是枪声吗？
Was that a gunshot?

175
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,560
额...
Uh...

176
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,570
我的天呐，发生了什么？
My god, what happened?

177
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,600
贝弗莉，她攻击了丹尼尔和罗宾逊那孩子
Beverly, she attacked Daniel and the Robinson kid.

178
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,140
好了，我得汇报这件事儿，我得汇报
Okay, I gotta call this in. I gotta call...

179
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,170
- 给你自己点时间，好吗？冷静下来      - 告诉他们，我得..
- give yourself a second, okay?Just calm, calm down.  -Tell them. I gotta...

180
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,910
- 给我点时间    - 你能去办公室打吗？
- Just give me a second.   - Can you just call from the office?

181
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,240
- 给我点时间
- Give me a second.

182
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,160
你感觉怎么样了？
How are you feeling?

183
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,700
怎么了？
What?

184
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,460
我没事儿
I'm fine.

185
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,330
嘘
Shh.

186
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,580
- 我没事儿了     - 放轻松，丹尼尔
- I'm okay.       - Take it easy, Daniel.

187
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,630
你看起来是癫痫发作了
It looks like you might have had a seizure.

188
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,540
不，不，不，不
No, no, no, no.

189
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,270
- 丹尼尔如果你头晕的话，你就不要试着站起来                 - 好的
- If you're feeling dizzy, Daniel,you shouldn't try to get up.    - Okay.

190
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,940
坐下，好吗？快点儿
Just sit down, okay?Come on.

191
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,250
- 我得去汇报              - 不，你得放松
- I gotta call it in.    - No, you need to take it easy.

192
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,110
一个州际警官已经到这儿了
There's a state trooper already here.

193
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,580
什么？
What?

194
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,580
- 哦，天呐，我昏迷多长时间了？         - 时间不长
- Oh God, how long was I out for?       - Not long.

195
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,460
显然他已经开始行动了，他要对你带进来的那孩子做点什么
Apparently, he was already on his way.Something to do with that kid you brought in.

196
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,690
听着，现在那不是重点
Look, it's not important right now.

197
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,260
那位警官可能想要和你谈谈
This trooper's probably gonna wanna talk to you.

198
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,730
我们考虑把你挪到另一个房间
We should see about moving you to a room.

199
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:11,200
- 不，不，不                                         - 你只是有外伤而已
- No, no, no.      - You just experienced an extremely traumatic event.

200
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,730
好的
Okay.

201
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,730
好的，听着，你现在就和你父亲一样固执
Okay, look.You are stubborn like your father was now.

202
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,500
你应该认真对待
You should take this very seriously.

203
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,210
我知道，我知道
I-I am, I am.

204
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,610
我很好
I'm good.

205
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,980
好吧
Alright.

206
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,010
丹尼尔
Daniel.

207
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,580
米歇尔
Mitchell.

208
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,720
你来了
There you are.

209
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,560
所以说发生了什么？他们跟我说是你发现那两个人的
So what happened?They told me you found the two of them together.

210
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,490
额，恩
Uh, yeah.

211
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:44,200
我赶到的时候，他已经死了，贝弗莉拿着把剪子
He was dead when I arrived and she came at me with a

212
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,100
想要攻击我
pair of scissors.

213
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,530
你怎么来得这么快？
How did you get here so fast?

214
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,370
你带来的人在另一个房间
Your guy in the other room.

215
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,210
- 他怎么样了？          -在离这儿北面20英里的地方发生了一场血案
What about him?     - We got a major bloodbath about twenty miles north of here.

216
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:57,080
看起来是他烧了那个类似于屠宰场的地方
Looks like he tore the place up like a butcher shop.

217
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,480
额，恩
Uh, yeah.

218
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,180
我们给他做了检查他身上大部分的血
We looked him over and most of the blood on his

219
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,720
都不是他的
body was not his.

220
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,350
额，根据之前的调查他买了很多药
Well he has a long list of drug related priors.

221
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,750
所以我认为是他给护士下了药
So I think he gave your nurse something.

222
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,520
我已经暂时把他拷在床上了
I've got him cuffed to the bed for the time being.

223
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,490
他已经醒了
He's been out cold.

224
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,660
现在我在这儿
Well I'm here now.

225
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,630
我会解决的
I'll sort it out.

226
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,360
我得拿上你的枪
I need to take your firearm.

227
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,600
恩
Yeah.

228
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,670
你知道，卡特，你爸爸是一个出色的警察
You know, Carter, your dad was a stand-up cop.

229
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:28,210
我想知道如果他碰上这种烂摊子，他会怎么想
I wonder what he'd think if he saw this shit show.

230
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,350
好了，我们需要弄清楚总共有几个人
Okay, we need to make sure everybody's accounted for.

231
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,150
谁还在这儿？
Who else is here?

232
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,680
鲍威尔医生和金
Dr. Powell and Kim.

233
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,090
哦，还有本和玛姬
Oh, and um,Ben and Maggie.

234
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,390
她怀孕了
She's pregnant.

235
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,290
天呐，真是太糟了
Christ, what a mess.

236
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:47,090
嘿，额，你介意我去汇报一下情况吗？
Hey, uh, do you mind if I call it in?

237
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,400
好的
Alright.

238
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,070
谢谢
Thanks.

239
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,650
我在里面打不通电话
I'm not getting through in here.

240
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,180
你收到了吗？米歇尔
Are you copying, Mitchell?

241
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,480
我打算去车里试试

Do you copy?I have a code three and I need assist.

247
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,470

248
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,960
嘿！

249

254
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,310
他流了好多血
He's losing a lot of blood.

255
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,710
按住伤口
Keep pressure over the wound.

256
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,540
丹尼尔，没事儿的，看着我
Daniel, it's fine.Look at me.

257
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,580

Kim, I need you to bring me a sutra kit and 8mg of morphine.

258
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,750
请你看着我，你能听到我吗？

260

00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,660
你会没事儿的，丹尼尔，你会没事儿的
You'll be alright, Daniel,you'll be alright.

264
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,990

- Keep breathing.      - Put both your hands here.Firm pressure.

265

00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,410
嘿
Hey.

278
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,350
好了，现在先别试着站起来
Okay, maybe don't try to get up just yet.

279
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,510
外面发生什么了？
What happened out there?

280
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,850
给他点儿时间
Just give him a second.

281
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,720
看起来他们把这个地方包围了
It looks like they've got the place surrounded.

282
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,120
但是他们不想进来
They're not trying to get in.

283
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,020
他们是谁？
Who are they?

284
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,490
我不知道
I don't know.

285
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,890
我打不通电话，你呢？
I wasn't able to get through. You?

286
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,500
不行
No.

287
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
我们应该让大家往里退后，谁知道他们想要什么
We should move everyone back inside.Who knows what they want.

288
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:58,570
不，我们或许把门堵住
No, maybe we can barricade the doors or uh, you know,

289
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,670
从另一条路出去
get out some other way.

290
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,080
该死，我把他忘了
Shit.I forgot about him.

291
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,420
救救我！
Do something!

292
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,750
他妈的打死他！
Fucking shoot it!

293
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,920
天呐，求你了！
Oh my god, please!

294
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,860
开枪！
Do something!

295
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,090
救救我！
Help me!

296
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,970
救救我！
Help me!

297
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,740
哦天呐，救救我，该死的！
Oh my god, fucking help me, god damnit!

298
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,570
救救我，救救我！
Help me, help me!

299
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,790
那是什么？
What is that?

300
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,900
我认为那是贝弗莉
I think that was Beverly.

301
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,870
天呐，那究竟是什么？我们得离开，就是现在，现在，快点儿
Jesus, what the hell was that?We're leaving.Now, now, now, now.

302
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,140
嘿，那可不是个好主意，丹尼尔
Hey, that's not a good idea, Daniel.

303
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,670
等等，等等，等等
Wait, wait, wait.

304
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,510
外面那些该死的疯子怎么办？
What about those fucking lunatics out there?

305
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,980
现在我们该担心的是别的，相信我
We got other things to worry about, believe me.

306
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,680
米歇尔，米歇尔！你和我，到那辆车里，好吗？
Mitchell, Mitchell!You and I, let's go get the cars, okay?

307
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,880
你和我一起去吗？
Are you with me?

308
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,980
那究竟是什么？
What the hell was that?

309
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:19,990
安全起见，赶紧退后
Make safe, back up.

310
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,050
离那门远点儿！
Stay away from the doors!

311
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,690
- 他拿着枪       -退后，退后，退后
- He's got a gun.    -Back, back, back.

312
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:23,890
好了，安全起见，安全起见
Okay, make safe.Make safe.

313
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,090
好的，好的，退后！
Okay, okay, drop it!

314
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,560
喔噢！好了，退后！退后！
Whoa!Okay, drop it! Drop it!

315
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,570
去你的
Fuck you.

316
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,570
妈的退后
Get the fuck back.

317
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,170
好了，把枪放下
Okay, put it down.

318
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,450
冷静，冷静
Stay calm, stay calm.

319
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:37,770
喔噢，大家都冷静下来！
Whoa, everybody,just stay calm!

320
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,740
妈的离我远点儿
Stay the fuck away from me.

321
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,510
冷静！
Calm down!

322
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,220
好的！把枪放下，没事儿的
Okay! Put down the gun,it's okay.

323
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,050
大家都该冷静
Everybody just calm down.

324
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,560
- 你说冷静？       -理查德，理查德，理查德
- Calm down, you said?     - Richard, Richard, Richard.

325
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,660
不，不，不
No, no, no.

326
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,260
没有理由把她牵扯进来
There's no reason to involve her in this.

327
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,270
理查德
Richard.

328
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,230
这样帮不了你
It's not gonna help you.

329
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,560
听着
Listen.

330
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,000
把刀给我，这就会结束
Just give me the knife and this will all be over.

331
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,030
这样也帮不了你
It isn't gonna help you.

332
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:12,170
理查德，我他妈不知道该怎么做了
Richard, I don't know what to fucking do!

333
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,710
别担心，玛姬
Don't worry, Maggie.

334
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,570
他不会伤害你
He's not going to hurt you.

335
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,580
把他给我
Just let me have it.

336
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,610
- 不！         -理查德！
- No!     - Richard!

337
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,010
金，金！
Kim, Kim!

338
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,180
我扶着他，我扶着他
I got him, I got him.

339
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,890
金
Kim.

340
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,260
看着我，看着我
Look at me, look at me.

341
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,160
我们不会在这个鬼地方死的！
We are not gonna die in this fucking place!

342
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,660
没人愿意死在这儿的
Nobody wants to be in here any longer than we have to.

343
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,100
- 相信我
- Believe me.

344
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,870
- 不，他哪儿都去不了
- No, he's not going anywhere.

345
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,940
该死的蠢货！
Fucking idiot!

346
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:58,850
好了
Alright.

347
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,320
那究竟是什么？
What the fuck was that?

348
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,060
亲爱的，你会没事儿的
Sweetheart, you're gonna be fine.

349
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,120
你会没事儿的
You're gonna be fine.

350
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,030
该死，他死了
Fuck's sake, he stinks.

351
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,100
米歇尔！
Mitchell!

352
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,140
退后！
Stay back!

353
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,090
哦，该死
Oh, fuck.

354
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,830
躲到办公室里，现在躲到办公室里
Get in the office.Get in the office now.

355
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,900
现在，就是现在！
Now, now!

356
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,840
躲到办公室里
Get in the office.

357
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,770
好了，躲到办公室里！
Okay, go to the office!

358
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:34,170
- 那究竟是什么？                                              -我不想再和你争论了，快走，快走！
- What the fuck was that?         -I'm not gonna argue with you. Go, go!

359
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,840
你得告诉我里面的是什么
You need to tell me what's in there.

360
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,380
我也不知道里面是什么
I don't know what's in there.

361
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,210
- 但是请你快走        - 把门锁住
- But please, just go.      - Lock the door.

362
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,250
好的，你们等等，你们是谁？
Okay. You hold on.Who are you?

363
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,050
给我走开
Get the fuck away from me.

364
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,780
喔噢，喔噢，放松
Whoa, whoa,just slow down.

365
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,720
你们是谁？你们是谁？
Who are you?Who are you?

366
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,750
告诉我们
Just tell us that.

367
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,790
我想要他
I want him.

368
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,160
好的，该死
Okay, fuck.

369
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,910
- 好吗？      -好的
- Alright?    - Alright.

370
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:53,330
我认为我们所有人都想离开这个鬼地方，对吗？这些个人差异，它们...
I think we all agreed that we need to get the hell out of this building, right? These personal differences, they're...

371
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,290
哦，丹尼尔！
oh, Daniel!

372
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,960
够了
Stop.

373
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,770
没人能出去
No one is going anywhere.

374
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,230
好的，好了
Okay, alright.

375
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,770
好的
Okay.

376
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,510
我们对这个地方不了解
We don't know anything about this place.

377
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,370
如果你让我们进来，我们才能信他
If you let us here,we can trust them.

378
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,510
你不必这样做
You don't need to do this.

379
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,080
住手！
Stop!

380
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,910
他不会回答你的
He can't answer you.

381
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,850
肖恩！
Shaun!

382
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,850
看见了吗？
See?

383
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,790
我才是他唯一信赖的人
That's what the last people he trusted did.

384
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,890
不，你弄错了，你可以相信我们，你可以相信我们
No, you're making a mistake. You can trust us, you can trust us.

385
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:25,920
我可不这么觉得
I don't think so.

386
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,500
等等，等等！求你别，不要！
Wait, wait!Please, please!

387
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,060
喔噢，喔噢，喔噢
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

388
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,460
把你的手拿开
Get your hands off me.

389
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,400
你没事儿吧？
Are you okay?

390
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,200
你得冷静
You calm down.

391
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,440
好了，我们没事儿
Okay, we're good.

392
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,540
你想让这些人再经历一次吗？
You wanna go through all this again?

393
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,880
我知道你相信我们
I know you believe me when I tell you we don't know

394
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,210
也不知道发生了什么，好吗？
what the fuck is going on, okay?

395
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,480
我...
I...

396
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,950
有东西从她的身体里冒出来
There were things growing out of her.

397
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,920
你看到了吧，你看到了吧
You saw it, you saw it.

398
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,220
那是什么？
What was that?

399
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:58,190
我们可以，把这个地方烧了
We could uh, burn what's left of the place.

400
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,560
把他们全都带走
Take them all with it.

401
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,560
好了，听我说
Okay, listen to me.

402
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,800
我们并不想伤害你们
We didn't do anything to you.

403
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,200
里面有个女孩儿快要生了
I have a girl back there who's about to give birth

404
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,100
我得给她找个安全的地方
and I need to get her some place safe.

405
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,370
你在开玩笑吗？
Are you fucking kidding?

406
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,100
你去看一眼外面那个女的？
Have you had a look outside lady?

407
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,000
她无处可去
There's nowhere to go.

408
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,570
你可以听到几英里外的号角声
You can hear those horns for miles.

409
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:16,210
有东西把他们召集到这儿了
There is something calling them all here.

410
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,980
好的，那是谁呢？他们又是谁？是什么...
Okay, what is that?Who are they? What just...

411
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,810
我怎么会知道？
how the fuck should I know?

412
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:22,450
- 去问他们！        -好了，好了
- Go ask them!     - It's okay, it's okay.

413
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,980
我所知道的就是那东西已经苏醒了
All I know is that that thing woke up once already

414
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,590
我可不想它又出现的时候，我束手无策
and I don't wanna be around when it happens again.

415
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,510
哦，有个问题
Oh, there's a problem.

416
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,840
玛姬
Maggie.

417
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,880
我不知道怎么做
I didn't know what to do.

418
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,380
好了
Okay.

419
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,880
嘿，甜心
Hey, sweetie.

420
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,050
我们能离开吗？
Are we leaving?

421
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,390
不，还不行
No, not just yet.

422
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,170
你能把烟熄灭吗？
Would you put that out?

423
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,900
嗷
Al.

424
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,310
- 什么，这个吗？        -对
- What, this?         - Yeah.

425
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,970
把它熄灭
Put it out.

426
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,980
好了，我觉得我们所有人都应该保持冷静
Okay.I think we all should just remain calm.

427
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,280
废话
Bullshit.

428
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,410
我们本来应该早就已经离开这儿了
We should've been out of here already.

429
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,080
你们应该清醒清醒
You people need to wake up.

430
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,350
能说点别的吗？
Or what?

431
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,560
你觉得外面有另外一个那样的东西
You think you'll stand a chance if there's another

432
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,290
你有希望出去吗？
one of those things out there?

433
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:42,090
- 好了，好了，好了         - 你能吗？嗯哼？谁能挡得住它？老爷爷吗？
- Okay.  Okay, okay.      - Will you, huh?Who's gonna stop it? Grandpa?

434
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,030
还是这个年轻的臭婊子
The teenage fucking slut.

435
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,430
哦！来啊现在！
Oh! Come on now!

436
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,130
喔噢，喔噢！
Whoa, whoa!

437
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,330
拜托
Come on.

438
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,500
我们会死的
We're gonna die.

439
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,970
不，我们不会死，你会死
No, we're not gonna die.You're gonna die.

440
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,170
我不会让这种事儿发生的
I'm not gonna let that happen.

441
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,310
好了
Okay.

442
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,950
好了
Okay.

443
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,620
我不知道你究竟想怎么做，好吗？冷静冷静
I don't know what the fuck you think you're trying to do.Okay? Just calm down.

444
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,220
他让孕妇的情绪低落，这样做非常不好
He's upsetting her and that is not good.

445
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,690
- 我想让你保持冷静         - 好的
- I need you to stay calm.     - Okay.

446
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:11,160
那你能告诉我那边到底怎么了吗？
Can you please tell me what is going on over there?

447
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,330
她的感染部位还在蔓延，但是她
Her contractions are still spread out, but she's

448
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,560
一直在腹痛，这不是一个好兆头
having abdominal pain which is a bad sign.

449
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,400
好吧，我不知道那是什么意思
Okay, I don't know what that means.

450
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,530
- 那意味着什么？     - 那意味着我们不能来回移动她
- What does that mean?    - That means that we can't move her.

451
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,500
那样会让情况变得更糟
It can make things much worse.

452
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,600
我现在要做的一件事就是在这期间我得给她
Also the last thing I need is to be performing a

453
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,270
做一个剖腹产手术，但是我
cesarean in the middle of this, but I have nothing

454
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,280
没有工具来帮她，如果我什么都不做的话，可能会死
here to help her and if I don't do anything the baby could die.

455
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,380
我得去药物补给室
I need to go to the med supply room.

456
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,210
所以我得去
So I'll go.

457
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,680
一个人吗？不，不，不行，那是不可能的
Alone? No, no, no,that's out of the question.

458
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,450
我并不是在请求你
I'm not asking.

459
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,550
我们现在得赶快处理
We need to handle this now.

460
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,420
好了
Alright.

461
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,530
好的，听着，我们不知道外面的是什么
Okay, look.We have no idea what is out there.

462
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,460
我们没办法保护自己
We have no way of defending ourselves.

463
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,630
另外这两个疯子把我们当作
Plus these two fucking psychos now think that

464
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,730
敌人
we're hostage.

465
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:54,370
我来处理
I'm doing this.

466
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:57,040
你不行，你不行，你甚至不能...
You're not. You're not.You're not even...

467
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,440
如果仅仅是因为这个孩子，你得去
If this is because of the baby then you need to get

468
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,670
精神科检查检查
a fucking mental check.

469
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:04,310
天呐，这不是我们两个人的事儿
Jesus Christ, this is not about us.

470
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:07,680
那个女孩儿，如果她胎盘早剥的话
That girl, if she suffers an abruption

471
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,350
她的孩子就会死
then her baby will die.

472
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,220
如果我试着从她肚子里拿出来的话，我不用
If I try to take it out of her, and I don't use

473
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:15,090
麻醉剂的话，她会休克而死
anesthetic then she could die of shock.

474
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,060
丹尼尔，看着我
Daniel, look at me.

475
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,530
好的，好吧，该死，该死
Okay, fine.Fuck it, fuck it.

476
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,560
额...
Uh...

477
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,500
好的，你不要一个人去
Okay, but you're not going alone.

478
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,140
你得保证等我，好吗？你能保证吗？
You have to promise and wait for me, okay? You promise?

479
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,440
- 好的      - 好的
- Okay.    - Alright.

480
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:41,280
我能靠近吗？
May I approach?

481
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,550
那女孩 不能顺利生产
The girl's not doing well and neither is the baby so

482
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:53,030
所以我们得拿点东西帮她
we need to go and get some things to help her.

483
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,260
你想从我们这儿要什么？
What do you want from us?

484
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,330
额，我的警车上有一把枪
Well I have a shotgun in my cruiser.

485
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,400
我得有弹药
I have ammunition.

486
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,440
我们很费力才来到这儿
We just fought our way in here.

487
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,170
我可不想再出去了
I'm not gonna just stroll back out again.

488
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:11,080
好吧，但是据我所知我们现在在一条船上
Okay, but as far as I can tell we're all the same boat.

489
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,810
你只拿了一把没有子弹的破枪
You've got a rifle without any bullets and a couple

490
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:16,380
和几把破消防斧
of fucking fire axes.

491
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:20,490
我只是...它很离这儿很近，我们很快就能拿到
I just...It's close and we can do it fast.

492
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,590
好的，但是我们不会为了你而豁出我们的性命
Alright, but we're not risking our lives for you.

493
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,260
我们得拿着那把枪，它是我们的
We get that gun, it's ours.

494
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,170
哦，绝对了
Oh, absolutley.

495
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:37,100
那他妈绝对是
Abso-fucking-lutley.

496
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,170
好的
Okay.

497
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,820
我以为它很近呢
I thought you said it was close.

498
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,690
搞什么？
What the hell?

499
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,690
它还在外面
It's still out there.

500
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:03,430
恩，那我们还等什么？
Yeah, but what are they waiting for?

501
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,430
快点儿行动吧
Let's just make this quick.

502
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:09,500
那把枪锁在了前座那儿
Shotgun's locked on the front seat.

503
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,270
我得打开它，但是...
I gotta release it, but...

504
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,710
你得从后备箱里拿到弹药
You get all the ammo out of the trunk.

505
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,680
没更好的法子了
Don't get any bright ideas.

506
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,450
嘿，等等
Hey, hold up.

507
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,320
该死
God damnit.

508
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,420
如果他们回不来了该怎么办？
What if they don't come back?

509
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,190
丹尼尔很清楚他所做的
Daniel knows what he's doing.

510
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,560
没事儿了
It's alright.

511
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,900
我就不应该来这儿的
I shouldn't even be here right now.

512
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,170
我应该去莱克兰照顾病人的
I should be at lakeland turning over patients.

513
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,800
这该死的地方
Fuck this place.

514
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,470
额，金，你现在和我们困在了这里，所以你得面对它
Well, you're stuck with us now, Kim, so deal with it.

515
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,880
你怎么样了？亲爱的
How you doing, honey?

516
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,710
我肚子疼
It hurts.

517
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:59,420
我的孩子会怎么样？
What's gonna happen to my baby?

518
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,620
听我说
Listen to me.

519
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,830
你和你的孩子都会没事儿的
You and your baby are going to be fine.

520
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,800
我向你保证
You have my word.

521
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,770
该死
Shit.

522
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,370
妈的
Fuck.

523
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,810
你究竟在里面搞什么？
What the fuck are you doing in there?

524
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:45,020
这里面到底怎么回事儿？
What the fuck's going on in there?

525
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,660
嗷，该死
Ah, shit.

526
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,860
K,时间到了
K, time's up.

527
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,760
那是我们撤退的暗号
That's our cue to leave.

528
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,740
快点，该死！
Come on, god damnit!

529
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,910
该死的！
Fuck's sake!

530
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,050
他妈的快点儿！
Fucking hurry up!

531
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,480
小心！
Look out!

532
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,390
我先拿着枪吧
I'm keeping the fucking gun.

533
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,870
这地方不可能有任何东西进来
This place isn't gonna keep anything out.

534
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,740
哦天呐
Oh my god.

535
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,740
嘿
Hey.

536
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,780
该死
Fuck.

537
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,080
发生什么事儿了？
What happened?

538
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,850
这儿，这里
Here, here.

539
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:46,920
- 艾莉在哪儿？                              - 她去给玛姬拿药了
- Where's Allie?        -Well she went to get some medicine for Maggie.

540
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,420
去哪儿？
Where?

541
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,350
医药室
The med room.

542
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,460
天呐
Jesus Christ.

543
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,660
她说待在里面就没什么可担心的了
She said there wasn't anything to worry about inside.

544
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,030
你们没待在同一个地方吗？
Are you guys in the same fucking building?

545
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,760
你愿意待在来这儿，照顾他们吗？
Would you please wait here, look after them?

546
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,600
抱歉，先生，你愿意跟着我吗？
Excuse me, sir, would you mind following me?

547
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,900
谢谢你
Thank you.

548
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,370
那孩子会没事儿的
That kid will be fine.

549
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,340
他已经承受了太多的不幸
He's been through a lot worse.

550
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,810
那些人杀了他全家
Those people killed his family.

551
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:13,010
我也差点儿没让他活着离开那儿
I barely got him out of there alive.

552
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:15,680
恩，那你呢？你这个神秘兮兮的家伙
Yeah, what about you, man of mystery?

553
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,550
别多管闲事
Mind your own business.

554
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,120
顺便说一声，如果那女人自己一个人跑了是非常愚蠢的做法
And by the way, pretty stupid to go running off by herself.

555
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,790
好的，我很确定那样你会
Okay, I'm pretty certain you can beat the shit out

556
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,720
打死我的，如果你闭上你的臭嘴的话
of me, but I consider it my special privilege to

557
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,790
很幸运的是我会恨我老婆的
hate my wife right now so if you could kindly shut the fuck up.

558
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,720
这是米歇尔的枪
This is Mitchell's gun.

559
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,700
该死
fuck

560
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,760
什么？
What?

561
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,540
你好，丹尼尔
Hello, Daniel.

562
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,680
你是谁？
Who is this?

563
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,050
你看见了...
You saw...

564
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,650
那东西
Something.

565
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,560
当你醒的时候我感觉到了它
I felt it when you woke up.

566
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,590
但是它是什么呢？
But what was it?

567
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,600
如果你想知道的话，我可以给你看更多
I can show you more if you'd like.

568
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,170
你好，理查德
Hi, Richard.

569
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:56,810
我知道你很难理解
I'm sure it's hard for you to understand.

570
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:04,020
贝弗莉也觉得它很难，但是我向你担保
Beverly found it difficult as well, but I assure you

571
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,820
我的目的对别人非常有利
my intentions are altruistic.

572
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:17,560
求你告诉我你做了什么
Please tell me what you've done.

573
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,970
理查德
Richard.

574
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,900
理查德，告诉我
Richard, tell me.

575
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,210
告诉我！
Tell me!

576
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,980
你正在走你父亲的老路，丹尼尔
You're trying so hard to follow in your father's footsteps, Daniel.

577
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:39,620
你真的想跟着他去死吗？
Do you really wanna follow him where he's gone?

578
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:45,090
我知道父亲的死让你多么绝望
I understand how desperate loss can make you.

579
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,290
那晚你把艾莉森带到我这儿，
The night you brought Allison to me, the life

580
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:52,560
她肚子里的小生命拼命地想要出世
inside her desperately clawing to get out.

581
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:58,200
我女儿的死让我彻底变了，但是我要让一切回归正常
Losing my daughter changed me, but I'm doing what I have to to make it right.

582
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,010
很快你就会明白了
You'll understand soon enough.

583
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,750
求你，你能告诉我你把艾莉森带到哪儿了吗？
Just please, can you please tell me where Allison is?

584
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,080
只是...
Just...

585
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,620
你告诉我，该死的
You tell me, god damnit.

586
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,750
你告诉我，她在哪儿
You tell me where she is.

587
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,990
别担心，丹尼尔
Don't worry, Daniel.

588
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:19,790
我是在帮她
I'm gonna help her.

589
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,960
我会帮你们所有人的
I'm gonna help all of you.

590
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,650
这太离谱了！我都不知道我在做什么
This is crazy! I don't know what I'm doing.

591
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,750
你不能丢下我们
You can't just leave us.

592
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,090
金，金，金，我们别无选择，艾莉森是唯一知道怎么救玛姬的人
Kim, Kim, Kim.We don't have a choice.Allison's the only one who knows how to look after Maggie.

593
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,230
求你，听着
Please, look.

594
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:55,630
就...
Just...

595
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:56,890
这些在这里面能用
These still seem to work inside.

596
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,260
不
No.

597
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,060
以防万一我们要保持联系
We'll keep in touch just in case.

598
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,070
我们不会离开很长时间，也不会走太远
We're not gonna be gone long, we're not going far.

599
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,870
- 听着       - 好疼啊
- Look.     - It hurts.

600
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:05,640
真的好疼啊
It hurts so bad.

601
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,310
我根本不知道接下来该做什么！
I don't know what half this stuff is!

602
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:09,870
求你，求你不要..
Please, please don't..

603
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,410
听我说，听我说，我们只是去下面而已，我会
listen to me.listen to me, please.We're just gonna down there, I'm gonna bring

604
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:16,750
带着艾莉森回来的，你需要坚持到那时候，好吗？
back Allison, and I need you to hold out until then, alright?

605
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:18,950
要是出事儿了该怎么办？要是那些人进来了怎么办？
What if something happens? What if those people get in here?

606
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:20,850
我们该怎么做？
What are we supposed to do?

607
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:23,090
那些人不会进来的
Those people are not trying to get in here.

608
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:26,690
那些人不会让我们逃出去的
Those people are trying to keep us from getting out.

609
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:29,430
好了，那是我找到的最好的武器了
Okay, that's the best that I can do.

610
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:31,300
但愿你知道怎么用它
I hope you know how to use it.

611
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,000
还有...
And uh...

612
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,270
以防万一这个就放到这儿
That's there just in case.

613
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:40,070
你最好清楚你现在在做什么
You better know what you're doing.

614
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:48,310
- 好了，我们走吧          - 你觉得我们会和你去下面吗？那可能吗？
- Okay, let's go.         - You think were just gonna go down there and that'll be that?

615
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:53,120
你最好别说话，你这自以为是的家伙
If you have something to say than say it, you smug fuck.

616
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:56,390
那知道下面的是什么吗？
Do you know what's down there?

617
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:57,960
不知道
Nope.

618
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,830
但是我知道有人可能知道
But I know someone who might.

619
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:08,970
嘿
Hey.

620
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:10,740
嘿，吸毒小伙
Hey, meth boy.

621
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,770
哦，该死
Oh shit.

622
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:13,910
哦，好了，你记得我们
Oh, good, you remember us.

623
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:14,710
不是我的错，好吗？
It's not my fault, okay?

624
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:15,440
你得相信我，我什么都没做
You gotta believe me.I didn't fucking do anything.

625
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,440
- 省省吧，省省吧！      - 求你救救我！
- Just save it. Save it!    -Please help me!

626
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:20,210
- 这些人会杀了我               - 嘿！
- These guys are gonna kill me!     - Hey!

627
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,110
请你认真回答我的问题
You're gonna wanna pay attention to my questions.

628
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,980
求你了，不，等等，等等，等等！
Please.No, wait, wait, wait!

629
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,150
哦，天呐，求你不要！
Oh god, please don't!

630
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:28,150
- 好了，选个手指吧        - 不要那样做
- Alright, pick a finger.       - Don't do this.

631
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:30,320
不，不要，你还没问我任何问题呢！
No, no, you didn't ask me anything yet!

632
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,460
我想确定你知道我是认真的
I wanna make sure you know I'm serious.

633
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,000
- 我相信你，好吗？我他妈的相信你        - 好了，好了，嘿！
I believe you, okay?I fucking believe you.      - Okay, okay, hey!

634
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,160
你知道做什么才能让我们安全吗？
Do you know anything that will help keep us safe?

635
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,830
不管是什么，一切能让我们活命的
Anything at all.Anything that will help us survive.

636
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:42,070
就是那个该死的医生
It's the fucking doctor.

637
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:43,300
就是那个该死的医生
It's that fucking doctor.

638
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,340
好了，好了，我们已经知道那个了
Okay, fine, we know that already.

639
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,170
我们没时间了
We don't have time for this.

640
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:47,970
好了，你知道什么？说清楚
Alright, you know what?Make it clean.

641
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:49,740
不，不，求你，就是他，就是他，我杀了他
No, no, please.It is him.It's him and I killed him.

642
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,380
我对天发誓，我帮了你们一个大忙
I swear to god I did you a fucking favor.

643
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,440
恩，但是他根本没死
Yeah, well he's not dead anymore.

644
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,150
那怎么可能？
How is that possible?

645
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,150
什么？
What?

646
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,220
天呐
Oh god.

647
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:00,380
哦，不，不！
Oh, no, no!

648
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,190
看着我，看着我！
Look at me, look at me!

649
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:06,760
哦，天呐！
Oh god!

650
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,960
住手！
Stop!

651
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,260
听我说
Listen to me.

652
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,900
他怎么还活着？他到底是什么？
How is he alive?What is he?

653
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,900
我真的不知道
I don't fucking know.

654
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,070
好了，弄开他的手
Okay, take his hand off.

655
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:16,870
不，不，求你,求求你1
No, no, please, please!

656
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:17,970
我不知道，我说真的
I don't know, I'm serious.

657
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,040
我在路上遇见了一个女孩
I met a girl on the road.

658
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,070
求你，求你，求你了，我在路上遇到了一个女孩，她和我说她能
Fucking please,please, please.I met a girl on the road and she told me she could

659
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,180
帮我搞到水晶，所以我就跟她来到了这个该死的医院
help me score crystal so I followed her to thisfucking pill house.

660
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,280
他根本就不是一个医院
Except it wasn't a pill house.

661
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,380
它是什么？
What was it?

662
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,520
它到底是什么？
What was it?

663
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,920
它是一个前不着村后不着店的老旧农场
It was an old farm house in the middle of nowhere.

664
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,050
外面那些都是毒贩子
All of these fucking junkies.

665
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,090
真是太糟了，看来他们杀人有一段时间了
It was a mess.It looked like they'd been killing people for a while.

666
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,960
他给我们药
He gave us drugs.

667
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,490
他观看我们做爱，他把我们召集到一个类似教堂的地方
He watched us have sex.And he called the place a church.

668
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,400
好的，那如你所说，理查德是某种
Okay, what you're telling me that Richard was some

669
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,870
性狂热者，还是某个邪教首领？
kind of sex fiend,religious thing?

670
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:50,200
我爸爸认识他好多年了，我们都认识他
My dad knew him for years, we all did.

671
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,370
你在胡说
That's bullshit.

672
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:52,970
他们就穿成这样
They were dressed just like this.

673
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:56,140
有好多穿成这样的人，好吗？
There's a bunch of people dressed like this, okay?

674
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,840
他们杀了人，然后献祭
And they did killings and sacrifices

675
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,010
而且还让我们观看
and they made us watch.

676
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:03,450
你是在说恶魔祭祀仪式吗？
You're talking devil worshiping?

677
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:04,950
不
No.

678
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:07,320
不，我不相信恶魔
No, I don't believe in the devil.

679
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,890
好吧，但是我相信这个
Okay, but I believe in this.

680
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:10,560
他们让人慢慢改变
They made people change.

681
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,190
我看到它了
I saw it.

682
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:13,490
谢谢你
Thank you.

683
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:14,890
你和我们一起去
You're coming with us.

684
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:16,230
不用谢我们
There's no reason to thank us.

685
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:17,260
什么？
What?

686
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:20,300
对，你知道吗，我们要去地下室看你的朋友
Yeah.You know what? We're gonna visit your friend in the basement.

687
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,130
不！
No!

688
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:22,530
- 嗯哼            - 你们疯了吗？
- Mhm.    - Are you nuts?

689
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,200
不，你看到他干的了
No, you've seen he can do.

690
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,370
我们快点儿离开这儿吧，好吗？
Let's just get out of here, okay?

691
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:26,240
离开这该死的地方
Fuck this place.

692
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,340
恩，瞧瞧
Yeah? Have a look.

693
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:29,170
走吧
Go on.

694
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,540
别客气
Be my guest.

695
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,410
不，你们这是在自寻死路，哦，天呐
No, this is suicide.Oh my god.

696
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:36,580
不，你和他们一样都是疯子
No, you're as crazy as they are.

697
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,280
恩，或许吧
Yeah, maybe.

698
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,300
往下走
Down here.

699
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:57,000
这地方看起来就要塌了
Looks like this place is gonna collapse.

700
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:02,910
你能听到我吗？
Can you hear me okay?

701
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,180
听得很清楚
Loud and clear.

702
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:09,250
通往地下室的楼梯就在那栋房子的后面
The stairwell to the basement is at the back of the building.

703
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,120
收到了
Roger that.

704
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:15,320
懂了
Got it.

705
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,410
看
Look.

706
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:43,150
有人来过这儿
Someone's been here.

707
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,200
金！我们该从哪儿走？
Kim！Where are we going?

708
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,310
停尸房的门就在你前方
The door to the morgue should be right there in front of you.

709
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,180
我没看到任何门，只看到很多走廊
I don't see any door.Just a bunch of corridors.

710
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,650
你确定你说的是这个地方吗？
You sure this is the right place?

711
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,290
他走错楼梯了
He went down the wrong stairs.

712
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:26,190
那儿只有一个楼梯啊
There's only one set of stairs.

713
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:28,160
我知道他们该往哪儿走了
I know where they're going.

714
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,130
有人吗？
Hello?

715
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,330
卡特！
Carter!

716
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:37,200
最好不要让我们落入圈套里
Better not be leading us into a trap.

717
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:44,080
怎么了？
What's going on?

718
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,980
哦，你在跟我开玩笑吧
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

719
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,420
你找到了吗？
Did you find it?

720
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:57,390
还有别的地下室吗？
Is there some kind of sub-basement or...

721
00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:00,260
不，不，不，你在说什么？
No, no, no, what are you talking about?

722
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,730
- 有一个通往下面的楼梯      - 什么？
- A staircase going down.   - What?

723
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:16,310
卡特，你能听到我说的吗？
Carter, can you hear me?

724
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,460
我们得回去
We gotta go back.

725
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,030
我不能让你跟我来这下面
I can't ask you to follow me down here.

726
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:36,690
你明白吗？
You understand?

727
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:40,460
伙计们，发生了什么？
Guys, what's happening?

728
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,600
没事儿，我们...
Nothing. We're...

729
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:49,070
我们打算往下走
We're gonna go down the stairs.

730
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,510
嘿，带他进去
Hey, leading in with him.

731
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,380
嘿，你先走
Hey, you get to go first.

732
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,720
恩，好的
Yeah, right.

733
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,320
我不想去
I'm not asking.

734
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:03,520
安静点儿
Be quiet.

735
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,280
别担心
Don't bother.

736
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:34,350
你不能动
You won't be able to move.

737
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,190
怎么了？理查德？
What? Richard?

738
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:43,160
耐心点
Be patient.

739
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,660
我快准备好了
I'm almost ready.

740
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,760
这是怎么回事？
What-what-what is this?

741
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,730
我明明看见你死了
I saw you die.

742
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,510
我不知道它想这样
I had no idea that it would feel like this.

743
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:58,780
这些年我为他人动手术
The years I spent operating on people.

744
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,350
割开他们，又为他们缝合好
Opening them up and stitching them back together again.

745
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:07,750
真的很奇妙，这种感觉，是没有...
It's remarkable, the sensation it's...

746
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:11,290
痛苦的，更多的一种轻松感
Not pain, more a sense of release.

747
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:13,660
为什么，你为什么...
Why, why are you...

748
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:16,130
请安静
be quiet, please.

749
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:17,900
这是一个未知的领域
This is uncharted territory.

750
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:23,500
是研究我改造计划的一次机会
The chance to study my own transformation.

751
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:27,510
我理解你的犹豫，艾莉森，但是
I understand your hesitation, Allison, but

752
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:31,380
让我问问你，这些年，难道你都没想过
let me ask you, all these years, haven't you ever

753
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:35,310
挽救一个难以复生的人吗？
wished to save someone beyond saving?

754
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:37,650
不论付出多大的代价
No matter what the costs?

755
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,250
额，失去萨拉后，我彻底毁了
Well, losing Sarah destroyed me.

756
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,460
但是，它也迫使我找到一个方法
But it also compelled me to find a solution.

757
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,570
当你一步一步研究时，你会对你所发现成果大吃一惊
You'd be surprised at the things you find when you go looking.

758
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:10,310
这里就好像墓里一样
It smells like a grave.

759
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:24,500
我以前没见过这个地方
I've seen this place before.

760
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,360
我们找遍了整个屋子
This was all over the house we cleaned out.

761
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,800
他就是想让我们看到这些东西
He made us look at things.

762
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,940
我之前看过更恐怖的
The worst things I've ever seen.

763
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:36,410
我们发现那个地方的地下室都是尸体
We found rooms full of bodies in the basement of that place.

764
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:38,980
他们把人放到桌子上，就像在做手术一样
They had someone on a table like they were doing surgery down there.

765
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,510
中途他们就变成这些东西中的一员
Half turned into one of those things.

766
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,580
不！
No!

767
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:46,820
不，比这更糟
No, worse than that.

768
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:49,250
就像梦魇一样
Like a nightmare.

769
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,390
这不是真的
It isn't real.

770
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:54,960
这不是真的
It's not real.

771
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:06,670
这就像一个迷宫一样
It's a rat's maze.

772
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,810
卡特！
Carter!

773
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:15,010
他来了吗？
Is he here?

774
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:16,410
嘿！
Hey!

775
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,880
恩
Yeah.

776
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,650
他带我来这儿生孩子
He has took me here to... baby.

777
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:22,590
孩子，我就在这儿
I'm right here, kiddo.

778
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:24,520
没事了，没事儿了
It's okay, it's alright.

779
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,460
你会没事儿的
You're gonna be fine.

780
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:29,530
你很幸运，你爷爷非常关心你
You're lucky your grandpa cares about you so much.

781
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:32,700
我爷爷只会抽着烟，对着电视叫
My grandpa just yells at his TV and smokes.

782
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:37,700
- 救救她，救救她       -该死，好了，好了！等等，等等
- Help her, help her. - Shit, okay, okay! Wait, wait.

783
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,300
求你救救她
Help her, please.

784
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,440
-  我觉得我能行的      - 好的
- The paradigm, I think.       - Alright.

785
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,870
好了，玛姬，再坚持一会儿
Okay, Maggie, hold still for one second.

786
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,610
我快好了，好的
I got this. Okay.

787
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:46,980
我给你注射点儿东西
I'm gonna give you something that's really

788
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,410
它会帮你止痛
gonna help you.

789
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,910
一会儿就不痛了
It's gonna feel really good.

790
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,350
- 你做得很好         -没事儿了，没事儿了
- You're doing real good.      - It's alright, it's alright.

791
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:52,720
- 好的             - 它会帮你止痛
- Okay.    - It's gonna be real painless.

792
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,320
很快就会没事儿的
It's gonna be okay in a second.

793
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,890
- 好的，好的          - 给我点时间
-Okay, okay.     - Just give me a second.

794
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:57,490
好的，好的
Okay, okay.

795
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:59,290
好的，你得按住她
Okay, you gotta hold her still.

796
00:54:59,290 --> 00:54:59,890
你得按住她
You gotta hold her still.

797
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:04,500
放松，我很快就好了，好的，准备好了吗？
Easy, once I get this in.Okay, ready?

798
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,730
来吧
There you go.

799
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,600
恩，恩
Yeah, yeah.

800
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,800
没事儿了
It's okay.

801
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,070
没事儿了，都解决了
There's no problem.No problem.

802
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,630
好极了
Great.

803
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,340
我不要去里面
I'm not going in there.

804
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,940
一枪打死我吧
Fucking shoot me.

805
00:55:58,350 --> 00:55:59,450
嘿
Hey.

806
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:05,360
就是它
This is it.

807
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,620
它是什么？
This is what?

808
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:12,730
我很欣赏你的胆识，但是我们得想清楚
I appreciate your enthusiasm but we need to think this through.

809
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:32,080
这么做不对
This is a mistake.

810
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,630
过来，你这个混蛋
Come here, you little fuck.

811
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,500
你知道你死后会去哪吗？
Do you know where you go when you die?

812
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:49,800
我知道
I do.

813
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:53,770
你一直在旅行，直到你重生成另一种东西，就像毛毛虫变成飞蛾那样
You travel on, reborn into something else, like a caterpillar becoming a moth.

814
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:59,610
现在我已经能控制茧里的飞蛾了
Until now I've only been able to track the moth in its cocoon.

815
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:01,980
当然这个躯体得慢慢适应
The body has to adjust, of course.

816
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:04,180
它在适应新环境
It adapts.

817
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,920
这种生物不是因为我们而诞生的
We weren't built for this kind of thing.

818
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:13,060
我承认，先前我出了很多差错
I admit, early on I made mistakes.

819
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:17,460
他们之中还存在之前的失误
Some of those earliest mistakes are still down here with us.

820
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:23,130
事实上，是他们引起了那场烧毁医院的火灾
In fact, they caused the fire that destroyed this hospital.

821
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:30,910
你明白，他们想死，但是我不允许
You see, they want to die,but I won't let them.

822
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:35,550
别哭，艾莉森
Don't cry, Allison.

823
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:37,110
我是在救你
I am going to help you.

824
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:42,020
这是生死轮回的结束
This is an end to the cycle of life and death.

825
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:43,690
你还想待在这个世界吗？这个抢走你儿子的世界？
Do you really want this world?This world that took your son from you?

826
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:48,690
你知道那晚你那未出世的儿子发生了什么吗？
Do you know what happened that night to your unborn child?

827
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:50,530
不，求你
No, please.

828
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:52,630
脐带缠到了他脖子上
Umbilical cord became entangled.

829
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:55,570
很简单，这不是很奇怪吗？
Simple as that.Strange, isn't it?

830
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:58,170
你与你孩子的生命线
The very lifeline between you and your child,

831
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:00,140
就像套在他脖子上的一根绳子，他越是拼命挣扎绳子就套得越紧
constricting like a noose around his neck as he struggled to get out.

832
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:04,640
越来越紧直到他无力挣扎
Tighter and tighter until finally it couldn't struggle anymore.

833
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:09,550
谁也没有办法
Nature's futility.

834
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:12,920
但是我可以阻止它
I can stop it.

835
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,950
这就是第一步
This is the first real step.

836
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:18,720
真正的复活
The true resurrection.

837
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:27,800
我的女儿到了地狱，但是今晚，我要
I lost my daughter to the abyss, but tonight, I am

838
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,500
唤醒她
calling her back.

839
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,900
理查德
Richard.

840
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,840
求求你
Please.

841
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,010
不要这样做
Don't do this.

842
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:40,880
但是一切就绪了
But it's already done.

843
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:56,690
你好漂亮，艾莉森
You are so beautiful, Allison.

844
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:00,630
你会变成最美妙的生物
You will become something truly remarkable.

845
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:29,030
这是一个屠宰场
This is a slaughter house.

846
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:36,770
放开我！
Get this off of me!

847
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:38,640
你上你的臭嘴\！NShut the fuck up!

848
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:42,140
在屋里的时候我就该杀了你
I should've killed you back at the house.

849
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:44,210
控制一下你自己
Get a hold of yourself.

850
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,120
她没事儿吧？
Is she alright?

851
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,690
她身体好热
She feels hot.

852
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:56,950
哦，天呐
Oh god.

853
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,120
- 天呐！救救她！       - 哦天呐，好吧！
- Lord! Do something!    - Oh god, okay!

854
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,090
好吧！
Okay!

855
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:05,030
额...
Uh...

856
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:06,200
控制一下你的情绪
Get a hold of yourself.

857
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,760
去你的
Fuck you.

858
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,330
看看我们周围，嗯哼？
Look around us, huh?

859
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,170
我告诉过你
I told you.

860
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:12,840
进来就是个错误
This was a mistake.

861
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:13,900
他知道点儿什么
He knows something.

862
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:23,750
我们需要你
We need you with us.

863
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:32,920
是他影响了他
He's in his head!

864
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,390
是他影响了他
He's in his head!

865
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:41,930
够了！
Stop it!

866
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:07,060
我们在地狱里
We're in hell.

867
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:26,810
你按住她！
You've got to hold her still!

868
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:28,750
会没事儿的！
It's gonna be okay!

869
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:29,980
会没事儿的！
It's gonna be okay!

870
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:37,150
是正门入口那儿！
That's the front entrance!

871
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:53,300
你要去哪儿？
Where are you going?

872
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,170
醒醒，该死！
Wake up, damnit!

873
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:09,720
- 我办不到！我真的办不到！     - 你必须成功！
- I can't do it!I can't do it!       - You have to!

874
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:46,960
不！不！不！不！不！
No! No! No! No! No!

875
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,970
你必须得去完成它！
You do what you have to do!

876
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:01,470
我会把这些混蛋赶出去！
I'll keep those bastards out.

877
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:04,110
我不想杀了她
I can't kill her.

878
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:05,540
你必须得那么做！
You have to do this.

879
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:10,310
你是她唯一的希望
You are the only chance she has.

880
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,110
不
No.

881
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:11,980
求你了！
Please!

882
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:13,880
抱歉，我办不到
Sorry, I can't.

883
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,850
求你快做吧！
Please do this!

884
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:20,120
哦天呐！
Oh my god!

885
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,930
你为什么要那样做？
Why did you do that?

886
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:34,970
这个时刻终于来了
It's finally time.

887
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:36,910
你怎么能？
How could you?

888
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,510
你的孩子
Your baby.

889
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:42,910
保罗医生是个好人
Doctor Paul is a great man.

890
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:46,580
我很幸运怀了他的孩子
I'm lucky to carry his child.

891
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:51,190
现在没什么要紧的了
Nothing else matters now.

892
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:04,870
别担心
Don't worry.

893
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:08,370
一切即将改变
Everything is about to change.

894
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:10,410
离我远点儿！
Get the fuck away from me!

895
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:24,610
等等
Just wait.

896
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:33,620
等等
Just wait.

897
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:39,300
我们得做什么？
What do we have to do?

898
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:43,430
等等
Just wait.

899
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:49,040
都是你的错
This is your fault.

900
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:57,210
这都是你的错！
This is your fault!

901
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:07,460
没有你，我不会在这儿
I wasn't there.

902
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:10,390
你本来应该保护好他们的
You should've protected them!

903
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,600
妈妈想要我们留在这儿
Mother wants us to stay.

904
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:18,000
我跟你说过，照顾他们
I told you,look after them.

905
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,270
但是你缺待在这里
But you stayed here.

906
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:23,470
你本来应该保护他们的！
You should have protected them!

907
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:27,440
留在这儿，留在这儿
Stay here, stay here.

908
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:54,240
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

909
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,580
到底怎么了？
What is this?

910
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:15,690
卡特，卡特，卡特！
Carter, Carter, Carter!

911
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:24,670
卡特，你在哪儿？
Carter, where are you?

912
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:29,610
闭上你的臭嘴，闭上你的臭嘴，闭上你的臭嘴
Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up.

913
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:31,410
闭嘴
Shut up.

914
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:41,520
该死！
Fuck!

915
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:09,450
丹尼尔？
Daniel?

916
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,690
丹尼尔？
Daniel?

917
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:02,700
艾莉森
Allison.

918
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,830
你在哪儿？
Where are you?

919
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,140
我好害怕
I'm scared.

920
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,140
不，不，不，不
No, no, no, no.

921
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:07,900
艾莉森，我就在这儿
Allison, I'm right here.

922
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:10,140
我在这儿，我就在这儿
I'm right here.I'm right here.

923
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:11,840
看着我，没事儿了
Look at me, it's okay.

924
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,820
哦，我能感觉到它要出世了
Oh, I can feel it coming.

925
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:24,690
哦，喔噢
Oh, wow.

926
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,220
握住我的手
Hold my hand.

927
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:31,190
我需要你
I need you.

928
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,660
我不会丢下你
I'm not gonna leave.

929
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,170
丹尼尔
Daniel.

930
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,340
我知道你的秘密
I know your secret.

931
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,350
我从你的脸上看到了它
I saw it in your face.

932
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:53,650
那一晚艾莉森流掉了你的孩子
The night Allison lost your child.

933
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:00,760
我看到了接班人
I saw relief.

934
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:10,570
你做了什么？
What have you done?

935
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:13,540
我给了她她想要的
I've given her what she wanted.

936
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:17,310
她是个母亲
She's a mother.

937
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:20,210
她不漂亮吗？
Isn't she beautiful?

938
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:41,930
丹尼尔
Daniel.

939
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:44,900
留下吧
Stay.

940
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,590
你看到了吗，丹尼尔？
Do you see, Daniel?

941
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,800
告诉我你所看到的
Tell me what you see.

942
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,300
我看到了...
I see...

943
01:11:55,940 --> 01:12:00,880
一个自认为自己是上帝的怪物
A monster that thinks he's god.

944
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:04,610
我很失望
I'm disappointed.

945
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:10,590
我给你展示了一切，你还是不明白
Of all the things I've shown you and you still don't understand.

946
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:13,520
不
No.

947
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:15,530
不，你说得对，我不理解
No, you're right, I don't.

948
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:18,700
我不承认死亡就是终点
I refuse to let death be the end.

949
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:20,860
我不信上帝
I defy god.

950
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:23,030
有一些更古老的东西
There are things much older.

951
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:27,100
比时间还要古老的东西，它们会保佑我
Older than time and they blessed me.

952
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:30,070
额，恭喜你
Well, congratulations.

953
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:35,850
我用我的一生抵抗死亡，但是现在我懂了
I spent my life resisting death,but now I understand.

954
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


955
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:38,410
我必须接受它
I must embrace it.

956
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:41,050
我会让我的女儿回来
I'll have my beautiful daughter back.

957
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:44,020
只需要做最后一件事儿了
I just need one final thing.

958
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:56,970
来吧，加入我吧
Come, join me.

959
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:20,690
所有聚集到这儿的人都会见证我女儿的重生
The others have all gathered to witness my daughter's rebirth.

960
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:26,800
我的信徒们已经准备好转换了
My disciples ready for their own transformation.

961
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:33,600
你自己也会重生，但是首先
You'll experience it yourself, but first,

962
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:35,940
你必须得为我而死
you have to die for me...

963
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:39,880
就像你爸爸和儿子那样做的
Like your father and son before you.

964
01:13:42,610 --> 01:13:45,180
亲爱的，你已经表现得很出色了
You've done wonderfully, my dear.

965
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:50,820
现在看着吧
Now watch.

966
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:53,590
你将会是我的观众
You will be my audience.

967
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:04,800
看着地狱之门为我打开吧
Watch the abyss open itself to me.

968
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,650
克莱文，保佑我的孩子
Calvin, bless my baby.

969
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:17,140
把我的女儿放入这个肉身吧
Place my daughter into this vessel.

970

把你献给她吧

972

让她苏醒吧

973

这就是她

一切回归原位
Everything has led to this.

983

在你之前我终于看到它了

这无垠的宇宙正在运转

我可以把艾莉森给你
I can give Allison to you.

988
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:27,120
那就是你想要的，不是吗？
That's what you want, isn't it?

989
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:30,290
她正在等你
She's waiting for you.

990
01:19:31,030 --> 01:19:37,370
你必须要做的就是一切随它而去，然后你们能团聚了
All you have to do is let go and you can be together.

991
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,970
真是个好孩子
That's a good boy.

992
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:47,940
一切都不会结束
This isn't the end.

993

对
Yes.

996

一切都结束了吗？
Is it over?

997
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:45,720
一切都结束了吗？
Is it over?

998
