3
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:24,251
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

4
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:28,589
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

5
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:35,513
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

6
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:41,602
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

7
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,374
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

8
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,002
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

9
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,300
Why are you telling me
about this dream?

10
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,803
You said I could tell
you anything I wanted.

11
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,096
Okay.

12
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,847
Anything else you should tell
me?

13
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,641
Nothing you don't already know.

14
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:27,309
I was about to turn 25...

15
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,187
and I liked eating, sleeping
and making love.

16
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,355
Like everyone else.

17
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:33,941
You know what everyone does when
they wake up.

18
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,321
OPEN YOUR EYES

19
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:09,309
- Where are you going?
- Out.

20
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,981
Don't record anymore messages on
my alarm clock.

21
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:15,024
Why not?

22
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:18,527
Because.

23
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,197
Because it pisses me off.

24
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,215
Come on, damn it.

25
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,929
- I'll beat you.
- We'll see about that.

26
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,765
Don't pretend you're poor.
You've got three cars

27
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:13,475
and you always drive me in this
junk.

28
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:14,852
Come on, I'm in a rush.

29
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,646
I hope you have no commitments.
I'm doing a bunk.

30
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,731
No, but I've got a meeting with
my partners.

31
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,817
Why do you think I'm wearing
this costume?

32
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,111
To show off, which is what you
like.

33
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,529
That's not true.

34
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,283
First of all, did you bang her?

35
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,242
Who?

36
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,869
You were with someone
last night.

37
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,912
Last night? I was alone.

38
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,165
- Why do you care?
- I don't.

39
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,584
You can do whatever you want
with your life, man.

40
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,626
Thank you very much.

41
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,712
Okay, enough. Let's change the
subject.

42
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,466
- Did you bang her?
- I told you.

43
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,468
- I was alone.
- So that means you did.

44
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,429
Is it the one you won't shut up
about?

45
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,347
- Who?
- Nuria.

46
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,935
My God, I can't believe it.

47
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,021
Csar is repeating a woman.

48
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:01,231
She must be awesome in bed, huh?

49
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,108
- She's not bad.
- Son of a bitch.

50
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,860
You should tell me the secret.

51
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,237
- The secret?
- The Coca Cola formula.

52
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,865
- One of the ones you like.
- Now you're changing the sub...

53
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,164
So, did you get some today?

54
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,207
No!

55
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,209
That's my problem. I'm not
getting any!

56
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,419
And then I'm amused when you ask
them

57
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,213
what they like most about a man.

58
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,341
"He must be smart, he must be
honest,

59
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,551
"he must be likable." Bullshit!

60
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,095
You wouldn't score so much if
you were like me.

61
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,139
That's enough. You're not ugly.

62
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,891
Many would trade their face for
yours.

63
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,100
You're completely normal.

64
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,145
That's it, I'm normal. That
doesn't mean I'm handsome.

65
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,855
- You are handsome.
- I'm acceptable.

66
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:45,692
When you're alone you're like an
anorexic girl.

67
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,861
They think they're fat, and they
end up going crazy.

68
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,821
Sure. When is a woman going to
claim you

69
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,032
so you'll clear the field for
the rest of us?

70
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:52,991
Sure.

71
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,034
Why not?

72
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,953
If you ever find the one...

73
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,914
The one doesn't exist. Shit!

74
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,291
How could I miss that?

75
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,002
God's punishment for talking too
much.

76
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:05,462
You'll see.

77
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,340
- Who are you talking to?
- God.

78
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,427
Do you believe in God?

79
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,639
Don't start with that.

80
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,683
I just asked you a question.

81
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,060
Don't answer if you don't want
to.

82
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:22,813
I don't believe in God.

83
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,358
Then, how do you
explain what happened?

84
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,028
- What?
- Your face.

85
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,282
There's no
explanation for that.

86
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,409
I think there is.

87
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,035
You think I'm crazy.

88
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,829
I only believe in what I see.

89
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,248
And you haven't let me see your
face yet.

90
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,499
Nor will I.

91
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,837
Do you really think
you're a monster, Csar?

92
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:47,879
Come on.

93
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,382
- Let me see.
- Shove your hand up your ass!

94
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:53,885
Calm down, you brat, okay? I'm
sick of your bullshit.

95
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,971
- Leave me alone.
- I'll fix you

96
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,848
- with a few punches.
- Leave me alone!

97
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,058
I can't do my job with you in
here.

98
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,519
Please, leave us alone under my
responsibility.

99
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,234
You're just a daddy's boy who's
always...

100
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,278
My parents are dead, moron!

101
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,947
Now you're making stuff up not
to admit what you did.

102
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:24,708
Is that true?

103
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:27,919
What?

104
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,881
That you're a daddy's boy.

105
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,843
My father had a restaurant
chain.

106
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,303
I'm not to blame for that.

107
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,097
When did your parents die?

108
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,643
Fifteen years ago, in an
accident.

109
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,606
- And now you're loaded.
- So they say.

110
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,817
Then I don't understand why you
don't want

111
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,402
a lawyer to defend you.

112
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,614
They claim they can get one of
the best.

113
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,158
But they just want me to stay
here forever.

114
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,993
- Who are they?
- My partners.

115
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:02,079
Those who've sucked on my blood

116
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,288
since I was a kid.

117
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:07,000
Now they've got everything.
They've made me incompetent.

118
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,128
That wasn't them. It was me.

119
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:12,547
Whatever.

120
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,095
Let's see, Csar. Do you know
why you're here?

121
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,932
For wearing a mask, I guess.

122
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:22,974
No.

123
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,143
You're here because you killed
someone.

124
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,105
Don't you remember?

125
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,440
Tell me.

126
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,567
- Don't you remember?
- Okay, enough!

127
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,278
Everything must be clear if you
want us to get along.

128
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,822
I don't want us to get along!

129
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,073
And that's the solution?

130
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,409
Refusing to talk, locked in
this... sty?

131
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,702
- We're talking now, aren't we?
- After two months.

132
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,084
I've been here for two months
eliciting words from you.

133
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,293
Read the files.

134
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,587
I have, but I want you to tell
me,

135
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,256
if possible, sitting in a chair.

136
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,509
- You'll always be like this?
- I like the floor.

137
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,430
It's the only thing that seems
real.

138
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:04,891
What about everything else?

139
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,102
Everything else is a lie.

140
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,981
All of this seems like a lie.
Including you.

141
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:12,899
You're not even wearing a gown.

142
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,026
Do you think I should wear one?

143
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,611
Doctors do.

144
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,448
I took it off so
you'd forget I'm a doctor.

145
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,117
- So you'd like me better.
- Well, it doesn't work.

146
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:23,827
I don't like you at all.

147
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:27,998
Okay.

148
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,042
Now we're such close friends...

149
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,002
I have no friends.

150
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,962
Please tell me what happened
that night.

151
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,841
The sooner you talk, the sooner
I'll leave.

152
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,111
Hey.

153
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,072
Congratulations, and all that
stuff people always say.

154
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,782
Partners.

155
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,535
And this girl? Where did you get
her from?

156
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:08,914
- She tried to steal from me.
- It was my book.

157
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,334
Okay. Csar, Sofa. Sofa, Csar.

158
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,087
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

159
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,381
- Here's your present.
- Thanks a lot.

160
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,675
We both bought it.

161
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,220
Then, thanks to both of you.

162
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,972
Stop flirting with her and open
it.

163
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,766
I'd rather open them tomorrow.

164
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,767
Okay.

165
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,809
- Drinks?
- Sure.

166
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,394
I'll take this upstairs.

167
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,582
Hey.

168
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,132
- What are you doing here?
- Congratulations, darling.

169
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,176
Thank you very much.

170
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,179
But I don't recall inviting you
to the party.

171
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,723
Very thoughtful of you.

172
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,857
I've brought you a gift, too.
Aren't you going to open it?

173
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,530
No, thanks. I know what's
inside.

174
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:24,823
You're different today.

175
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,659
Nuria, it's not at all funny
that you came unannounced.

176
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,244
Or that you went into my room.

177
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:30,245
Wow.

178
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,788
- Do I have to apologize?
- No.

179
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,082
You have to go.

180
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,211
I understand. I know what's
happening to you.

181
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,089
You don't want anyone to see you
twice with the same girl.

182
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,466
Your reputation would go to
hell, wouldn't it?

183
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,678
You nailed it.

184
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,722
You must have checked out some
hottie.

185
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,015
- Of course.
- Who?

186
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,933
That brunette you were talking
to

187
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,518
a moment ago, right?

188
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:54,894
She's not bad.

189
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,897
I don't care.

190
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,692
I don't need anyone to see me
with you.

191
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:08,408
Hold me. Hold me.

192
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:16,249
Come on, just a kiss.

193
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:20,629
Just a little.

194
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:26,718
Come on.

195
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:37,562
Until when? Next Friday?

196
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:38,563
I doubt you remember

197
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,357
what a weekend without me is
like.

198
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,569
I'm sorry, I have to attend to
my guests.

199
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:46,905
Hurry, that brunette's going to
take a while.

200
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,406
She seems to be one of those.

201
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,035
- One of those?
- Yeah.

202
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:54,079
The ones who can't find the
zipper.

203
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,877
- Hi.
- Hi.

204
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,756
- What do you want?
- To open this.

205
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:07,258
Hold on. I'll pour some for you.

206
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,180
Since when are you the
bartender?

207
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,641
Don't you know I work in
hospitality?

208
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,353
Is something wrong?

209
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,481
Is it too obvious I'm hitting on
you?

210
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,110
- A bit.
- I just have a little problem.

211
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,986
- A woman's harassing me.
- You don't say.

212
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,655
And I need to bother someone

213
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,407
to get rid of her.

214
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,825
And I'm the lucky one.

215
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,034
Shit! She's there.

216
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,494
- Where?
- Don't look.

217
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,329
- Where is she?
- Look over there.

218
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,998
So yes, sure.

219
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,210
- Sure.
- Yeah.

220
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:44,504
- Here we are.
- Here we are.

221
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,257
Okay.

222
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,801
Pretend we're talking

223
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,594
about something interesting.

224
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,265
You nod, you say yes.

225
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,393
And... okay.

226
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,562
- Nice conversation.
- Very nice.

227
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,522
Especially because I think she's
coming over.

228
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:03,815
No way.

229
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,861
- I need to use the restroom.
- I'll tell you where it is.

230
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,821
- Look ahead...
- I don't see her anymore.

231
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,322
Right here.

232
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,325
- Come on in, ma'am.
- I'm not going in there.

233
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,618
I will. See you later.

234
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,299
- She's here.
- You're a...

235
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,137
Okay. We're safe.

236
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,015
The downside is there's no
drinks here.

237
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,600
I think you're messing with me

238
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,059
and you just want to hook up.

239
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,020
Well, that too, but it's
secondary.

240
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,022
What matters now is to be safe.

241
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:46,399
Can't you tell her you're not
interested?

242
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:49,068
No way! She doesn't care. She
never gives up.

243
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:52,197
- It must be hard for her.
- Yeah, sure.

244
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,799
What's your major? Dramatic
Arts, like Pelayo?

245
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,384
- For now.
- Set design?

246
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,178
- Interpretation.
- Wow.

247
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,806
- You want to be an actress?
- I am one.

248
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,809
- Is there a problem?
- Well, yeah.

249
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:23,019
- Aren't you ashamed?
- Ashamed?

250
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,688
Why would I be ashamed?

251
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,524
Actors aren't honest people.

252
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,777
You're capable of showing
feelings you don't have.

253
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,404
Or that you make up, at most.

254
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,365
Right now you may be thinking,

255
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,409
"Jeez, he's so annoying. How
will I get rid of him?"

256
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,746
- You think?
- "And he's got a hotel."

257
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,916
But you're a good actress and
you don't show it.

258
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,269
Hey, Pelayo.

259
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,354
- You caught us.
- Come in.

260
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,400
- How's it going?
- Good. I'm a little wasted.

261
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,778
- Drunk.
- Why are you locked up in here?

262
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,407
Sofa is defending me from a
certain psycho

263
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,658
who's roaming out there.

264
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,826
She seemed dangerous.

265
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,079
- Okay.
- What about you?

266
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:26,374
I'm drinking. Women don't chase
me.

267
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,001
We're out of liquor.

268
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,502
Want some?

269
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,963
- Shit. I'll go get more.
- Hey.

270
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,257
I'll get some for all of us.

271
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,723
Well, um... I'm leaving.

272
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:42,807
What do you mean?

273
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,018
I drank too much and I'm not
okay.

274
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,896
Bullshit, Pelayo, this is just
starting.

275
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,731
- It just started for you.
- Pelayo...

276
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,901
you can't go. You're my guest
of honor.

277
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,863
You're a son of a bitch.

278
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,158
- Where's that coming from?
- Are there no other girls?

279
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:03,703
I go take a piss for a moment,
you start talking to her and...

280
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:04,746
And what?

281
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,751
And nothing. I don't want to
look like a fool.

282
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,878
Explain right now what the
hell's wrong with you.

283
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,882
Why did you have to hook up with
Sofa of all people?

284
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,717
No one's hooking up with Sofa.

285
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,427
Sure, so I'm blind, right?

286
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,221
You're a bit drunk.

287
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,188
I'm drunk, but I'll tell you one
thing.

288
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,815
I like Sofa very much. I like
her a lot, dude.

289
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,943
In fact, she may be the one.

290
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,779
But if I'd known it would mess
up our friendship,

291
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,405
I'd have told her to fuck off.

292
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:43,534
- Same here.
- Sure.

293
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,461
Pelayo, where are you going?

294
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,589
- Home.
- Already?

295
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,592
- Yeah, I'm beat.
- Hold on, I'll go with you.

296
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:01,010
Don't, it's...

297
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:02,679
It's not necessary.

298
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,888
You're leaving too?

299
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,142
I have to get up early tomorrow.

300
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,353
I can take you home later.

301
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,315
Stay. You're in good hands.

302
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:21,322
- What's with him?
- He's drunk.

303
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,909
- Did we upset him?
- Of course not.

304
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,327
Are you sure?

305
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,292
She doesn't seem very happy.

306
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,253
Didn't you have to get up early
tomorrow?

307
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,591
I'm doing too much for
you tonight.

308
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,803
- Maybe that means something.
- Yeah, that you're shameless.

309
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,722
It's just a moment.

310
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,016
Enough for my friend Nuria to
give up.

311
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,268
This is my house.

312
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,480
- If you mock it, you're out.
- Why would I mock it?

313
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:57,525
It's no big deal, but rent's a
bargain.

314
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,699
- You like clowns?
- They're not clowns.

315
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:06,868
They're mimes.

316
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,203
Pancho!

317
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,457
- I have a cat.
- I hate cats.

318
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,668
They're almost as fake as
actresses.

319
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:17,795
Said the hotel owner.

320
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:20,965
How do you pay for this?

321
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:25,887
Do your parents help you out?
Did you get any acting jobs?

322
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,847
He's nosy. Don't you think,
Pancho?

323
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,267
- I'm an arms dealer.
- No kidding.

324
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:34,395
I always wanted to see how an
arms dealer lived.

325
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,189
Well, now you know.

326
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,256
How do you want me to tell it?

327
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,593
You wouldn't understand. Not
even I understand it.

328
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:08,721
She started to make coffee

329
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,473
and I started to snoop around.

330
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,810
And suddenly, I felt

331
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,561
that stupidity apparently, many
people feel.

332
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,189
- I like it.
- What did you feel?

333
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:22,193
That I loved her. God, I'm
ashamed to even say it.

334
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,569
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

335
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:28,032
- I said I like your place.
- And I like yours.

336
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:29,992
We can switch.

337
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,911
I doubt you'd like it so much in
the morning.

338
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,914
Besides, I meant because of the
decor.

339
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:39,127
I don't know, your place is
more... more personal.

340
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,462
- And warmer.
- Warmer?

341
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,506
- Yeah.
- You thought my house was cold?

342
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,384
- A little.
- Do you think I'm cold?

343
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,343
I don't know.

344
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,137
But my house is. Which is it,
then?

345
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,723
If you expect me to praise you,
you'll wait a long time.

346
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:55,643
You think you're so clever.

347
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,646
- Maybe.
- You're so wrong.

348
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:01,023
I don't need you to tell me what
my virtues are.

349
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,151
No, I'm sure you know what they
are.

350
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,028
But you'd like to know that I've
seen them too.

351
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,029
You wish.

352
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,865
I'm not arguing over something
so silly.

353
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:10,616
That's better.

354
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:13,119
- You would've lost.
- You think?

355
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,663
I don't want to argue, either.
In fact,

356
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,582
I'll propose the opposite.

357
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,168
- Not to argue?
- To name each other's flaws.

358
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,171
Good.

359
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,561
I hope you're doing right by me.

360
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,479
You've never been depicted more
faithfully.

361
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,693
Okay, mine's ready.

362
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,116
Holy shit.

363
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:55,369
This is how you see me?

364
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,581
- Was it too much?
- Sign it.

365
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,087
Let me see mine.

366
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:09,217
It's beautiful.

367
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,720
But it's not a cartoon.

368
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:14,013
I wanted you to see.

369
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:15,556
I didn't know you drew so well.

370
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,475
- I'll sell it to you.
- For how much?

371
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:22,980
Since it's you, I'll settle
for... one kiss.

372
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,072
That smile is going to kill me.

373
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:38,496
It'd be very wrong for us to
hook up tonight.

374
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,749
- Why?
- Pelayo, remember?

375
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,085
He's your best friend.

376
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,963
He doesn't need to find out.

377
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,006
Besides, he'd do the same.

378
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,885
I see friendship comes first for
you.

379
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:53,970
It does.

380
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:55,763
That's why I wouldn't tell him.

381
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:07,149
Some people claim

382
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:09,402
they settle for a normal
duration

383
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:10,444
of their lives.

384
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:11,904
But "normal"...

385
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:14,615
means different things
depending on the period.

386
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:15,700
What are you watching?

387
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:19,328
I'm watching TV.

388
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:21,539
was living just 25 years.

389
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,917
Nowadays, that number has
tripled.

390
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:28,296
- Thus...
- What is he talking about?

391
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,006
I've seen that before.

392
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,426
It's a feature about cryonics.

393
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:35,261
"Cryo" what?

394
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:40,558
It's when they freeze you or
something. Like Walt Disney.

395
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:44,645
Brr! How cold!

396
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:45,771
Hey, handsome!

397
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,274
Cause a landslide by
being here.

398
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:50,860
It's not dangerous. It's firm
land,

399
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,029
and it's very solid.

400
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,365
You're leaving?

401
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:57,491
Home.

402
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,951
I'll leave you my number.

403
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,329
I'll call you tomorrow, anyway.

404
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:03,372
What for?

405
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,419
Okay, then I won't call you.

406
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,379
Csar.

407
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,300
- What is it?
- Come here.

408
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,469
I'll tell you a secret.

409
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:28,064
Come here.

410
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,018
Hi, darling.

411
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,772
- You've been following me?
- Of course.

412
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:13,192
No. I had a feeling we'd run
into each other.

413
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:15,236
- Okay.
- How was it with the brunette?

414
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:16,904
Very well. Why?

415
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:20,366
Your face. I'd say you didn't
sleep with her.

416
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,076
Let me guess.

417
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:24,203
You didn't, but you don't care,
either.

418
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,871
Is that so?

419
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:28,582
You have all the time in the
world to win her over.

420
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,043
In fact, you surely made plans
for tomorrow or the day after.

421
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,379
- Brilliant.
- Right? And there's more.

422
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:36,507
- Tell me.
- I hooked up with someone, too.

423
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:37,758
But he didn't measure up.

424
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,802
So I was left wanting more.

425
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:40,761
So?

426
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:43,764
Until you see Miss Universe
again,

427
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:45,683
you could do with some fun
yourself.

428
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:50,229
I think I'd rather go to sleep.

429
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:51,439
Come on, Csar.

430
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,190
It's your birthday. You deserve
a prize.

431
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:59,238
Don't insist. I'm going home.

432
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,198
What's wrong, Csar? Are you
afraid?

433
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,283
Do you want some? It's from the
party.

434
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:45,326
No, thanks.

435
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:47,661
Play the good boy now.

436
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,164
I don't need a fix to have fun.

437
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:51,373
I've seen that.

438
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,335
You shouldn't take that, you're
driving.

439
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:00,424
Suit yourself.

440
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:06,639
What's happiness to you?

441
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:08,766
What?

442
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,101
To me, happiness is this. Being
here with you.

443
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,144
Isn't it to you?

444
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,939
I don't know, Nuria.

445
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,358
I'm not in the mood for
significant talks right now.

446
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:21,237
It's just your mind is
elsewhere.

447
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,404
Isn't that right, honey?

448
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,240
Maybe.

449
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:34,750
Just one thing bothers me.

450
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,877
What is it?

451
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,420
That you don't know anything
about me.

452
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,132
You just know I'm Nuria and I'm
a good fuck.

453
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:43,926
Two very important things.

454
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,345
You probably don't even have my
number.

455
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:51,308
This is a start. I'll see your
place now.

456
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:54,478
We're almost there.

457
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:07,575
Tell me, do you believe in God?

458
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:20,713
No!

459
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,047
No!

460
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:12,640
- Hi.
- Hi.

461
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:16,894
How are you?

462
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,646
- How was the ride home?
- Okay.

463
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:21,357
I had a horrible dream.

464
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:23,525
That you never saw me again?

465
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:25,110
Yeah.

466
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:27,237
I'm leaving your place, heading
to my car,

467
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,365
and it turns out that slut has
been following me.

468
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,450
- Who? That Nuria?
- Yeah.

469
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:33,494
She tells me, "Do you want a
ride?"

470
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,871
She insists, and I don't know
how to say no,

471
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:37,831
so I get in her car,

472
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:40,751
and she starts revving up...
Then, boom!

473
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:43,170
She commits suicide with me in
there.

474
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:45,130
- That's awful.
- That's not the worst part.

475
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:48,342
The worst is my face ends up
completely ruined,

476
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,636
like the Phantom of the Opera.

477
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:53,514
I couldn't wake up.

478
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,724
I was a monster.

479
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,395
You're a monster anyway.

480
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:01,438
- Am I?
- Yeah.

481
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,315
I'm a monster too.

482
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,859
Look.

483
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:11,448
How was your place?

484
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:13,867
Was there anyone left?

485
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,870
Why would there be anyone left?

486
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:20,207
There was a party at your place,
remember?

487
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:22,793
A party?

488
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,009
Dreaming sucks.

489
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:35,806
That was a nice
dream. A park...

490
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,559
Some kids playing, a woman who
loves you.

491
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,060
Exactly.

492
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:42,312
Then you wake up and you want to
die.

493
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,867
At first, I didn't even have the
strength to react.

494
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,245
I'd been in a coma for three
weeks.

495
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,330
You were very lucky.

496
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,582
You could've died.

497
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:03,751
- Like Nuria.
- So what?

498
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:07,504
It would've been better.
Besides, did you see her body?

499
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:09,465
No one showed it to me.

500
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:10,924
You think she survived?

501
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:13,385
I'm like you.

502
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:15,929
I only believe in what I see.

503
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,809
Csar, show me your
face, please.

504
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,978
- Why are you asking that now?
- Look...

505
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,938
It's true you were in an
accident.

506
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,356
It's true you were disfigured.

507
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:27,733
But now you're perfectly fine.

508
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,067
- No.
- Take that off.

509
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:30,611
Doctors redid your face.

510
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,279
They had no fucking clue!

511
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,907
In the accident, you
not only lost skin

512
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:36,116
and part of your muscles,

513
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:38,577
the impact on your head was so
hard,

514
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:40,370
it caused multiple fractures.

515
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:42,206
We've held the bone structure

516
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,457
with metallic string,

517
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:46,752
and over it we've reinserted the
muscles

518
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:48,629
that could still be salvaged.

519
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,839
That's all very nice,
but I know this.

520
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,467
You've explained it to me 150
times.

521
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:55,928
But you never tell me when I'm
having surgery.

522
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,971
I've been waiting for over two
months.

523
00:34:58,347 --> 00:35:00,349
You've already had surgery.
Three times.

524
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,017
I wouldn't call this surgery.

525
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:04,436
I'd call it... well...

526
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,105
I don't even know what to call
it.

527
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:09,650
Even though the symmetry isn't
perfect,

528
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,944
we want you to understand that
what we did

529
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,862
with your face is, pardon my
honesty,

530
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:15,322
very hard work.

531
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:17,699
We can't work on skin that's
pure scar.

532
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,035
No, there has to be a way.

533
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:21,578
- Which way?
- Seriously?

534
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:23,664
You're the doctors, aren't you?

535
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:26,792
A transplant, I don't know!

536
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:28,794
There's a fibrosis issue,

537
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,046
and if we operate again, there's
a risk

538
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:32,381
of causing new damage.

539
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,550
We'd need absolute precision.

540
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,302
And that is impossible right
now.

541
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,973
Let's see. I'm no idiot.

542
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:44,309
Nowadays, people remove their
breasts or get new ones.

543
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,395
They get hair implants.

544
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,647
They change their face, even
their skin color.

545
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,359
You're telling me that in the
wake of the year 2000,

546
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:54,945
you're not capable of performing
a simple operation

547
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,154
and fix this...

548
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,032
- this shit?
- It's not that simple, Csar.

549
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,993
- Remember that...
- Don't talk to me like that!

550
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:02,911
Don't treat me like a kid!

551
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,958
I'm not just any patient,

552
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,627
and this isn't Social Security.

553
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,424
I'm willing to pay whatever is
necessary.

554
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,013
You're the boss here.

555
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:23,974
They say you're the best in your
specialty.

556
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,935
Then make something up, damn it.
Experiment with me.

557
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:28,770
I've seen patients

558
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,230
who've lost all of their
functions.

559
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,190
Who can't even speak.

560
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,902
At least you can look yourself
in the eye.

561
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:36,987
What's the point of that?

562
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:39,448
I want to die

563
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:40,991
every time I look in the mirror.

564
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,242
Your case isn't so severe.

565
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:45,162
You just have to learn to accept
yourself.

566
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,663
And who's going to accept me?

567
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:49,207
Tell that to the people

568
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:50,751
who look at me on the street!

569
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:55,130
Are you going to tell everyone
that looks don't matter?

570
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:57,132
That beauty is inside?

571
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:05,390
I'd like you to see something.

572
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:28,205
- What's this?
- A facial prosthesis.

573
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:31,541
We resort to it in cases of
extreme rejection,

574
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:32,584
like yours.

575
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:43,095
This is bullshit.

576
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:44,888
It's not the best solution.

577
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,140
But it's all we can do

578
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,183
for the time being.

579
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:51,186
I want a face! Not a mask.

580
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:54,648
We're not miracle workers.

581
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:57,192
That's what the fucker told me.

582
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:00,529
But in the end, they did it.

583
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,324
- What?
- They worked a miracle.

584
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:08,620
- So it seems.
- "So it seems"?

585
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,873
Things just are or are not. They
either did it or not.

586
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,251
I'm really tired. Why don't you
just go?

587
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:20,966
I'll be back next Tuesday.
Should I bring you anything?

588
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:23,552
- No.
- Okay, then. Until Tuesday.

589
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,053
A notepad and a pencil.

590
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:27,597
But don't say I asked for them.

591
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,974
I don't want to owe them
anything.

592
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:10,403
Have I changed that much?
Because I can recognize you.

593
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:19,621
- How are you?
- How am I?

594
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:23,083
You're playing a part right now,
but I don't know which one.

595
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:26,628
Your mouth is smiling, but your
eyes are trembling.

596
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:27,796
Nonsense.

597
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:31,216
Truth is, you're very good. A
good actress, I mean.

598
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,427
I asked you how you were. You
don't have to answer.

599
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:35,470
Well, I'm alive.

600
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:39,224
How do you expect me to be? And
tired.

601
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:41,601
Tired of waiting for you to
call,

602
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:44,479
at least to say, "You had really
bad luck, man."

603
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:46,523
- I've been really busy.
- Bullshit.

604
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,861
I was afraid you'd be
uncomfortable

605
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,029
if I called you.

606
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:57,284
No, you were afraid you'd be
uncomfortable.

607
00:42:58,535 --> 00:43:01,955
You were afraid you wouldn't be
able to look at me, like now.

608
00:43:13,717 --> 00:43:14,884
That's not true.

609
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,529
Sometimes, I've dreamt of this
moment.

610
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:36,573
Which moment?

611
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:41,995
The moment we saw each other
again.

612
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:47,042
In my dreams, we were just like
now. Like this.

613
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:50,503
In the park. Although, well...

614
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:52,589
there was something different.

615
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:56,092
Was there?

616
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:01,973
In my dreams, it doesn't rain.

617
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:07,729
I have to go, Csar.

618
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:09,773
What are you doing tomorrow
night?

619
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:11,649
Studying. I've got a lot of
work.

620
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,360
It's Friday tomorrow. We could
hang out.

621
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,236
I don't know. Like I said, I'm
busy.

622
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:16,654
Okay, then. See you.

623
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:20,408
Csar!

624
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,163
We can hang out if you want.

625
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:27,749
If you want.

626
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:41,763
The client is put
in a maintenance capsule,

627
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:44,015
while the legal process for his
or her transportation

628
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:45,141
is worked out.

629
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,769
In the warehouse in Arizona,
United States,

630
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:50,146
a team of specialists prepares
the body

631
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,314
to be frozen...

632
00:44:53,817 --> 00:44:56,986
which substitutes blood for a
liquid solution

633
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:59,030
that allows for the preservation
of organs.

634
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:04,494
The client is put
in the capsule,

635
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:06,413
where he or she will remain
until medicine

636
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:07,622
allows for his resuscitation.

637
00:45:12,836 --> 00:45:15,338
Honestly, I'd think it over a
couple of times.

638
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,215
It's a proposal that's hard to
take in.

639
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:19,342
How should we approach it?

640
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:21,511
Surely, we find ourselves

641
00:45:21,553 --> 00:45:23,847
in the face of an unprecedented
event.

642
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:26,641
A new challenge for humankind.

643
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,811
It's understandable that the
first reaction

644
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:30,854
is that of rejection.

645
00:45:31,855 --> 00:45:34,065
Now we have the means to do it.

646
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:35,608
We have the technology.

647
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:40,989
But above all, we have enough
moral maturity

648
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,117
to understand what this step
means

649
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:45,410
in human evolution,

650
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,037
to look into the future and end
with certain taboos

651
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,539
that no longer make sense.

652
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:51,916
Inherited from ancient religions

653
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,377
and old, useless memories.

654
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:57,172
Thanks for being on our show.

655
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:00,008
Thank you too, for...

656
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:27,785
- Hey.
- Hey.

657
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:31,206
- What is that?
- I know, it's a bummer, right?

658
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:34,751
But I was advised to wear it
because of infections.

659
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:36,252
Sure.

660
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:40,632
What's up, dude? What's going on
in your life?

661
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:43,635
I spend every fucking day
arguing with doctors.

662
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:45,803
- You should go out more.
- I'm trying.

663
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:48,806
- What are you drinking?
- Rum and Coke. Want some?

664
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,391
- Okay.
- I'll get it for you.

665
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:54,229
- I'll go to the restroom.
- Okay.

666
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:59,067
- Dude, take that off.
- Why?

667
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,361
Because, can't you see? Try as
you might,

668
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:02,904
you won't be able to hide your
face.

669
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,365
I told you it's so I won't get
an infection.

670
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:07,075
Sure.

671
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,953
Dude, if I'm embarrassing you,
you can just go.

672
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:11,579
No one asked you to come.

673
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:12,580
Sofa asked me to.

674
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:13,623
What?

675
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,543
She didn't want to be alone with
you.

676
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:18,086
Why not?

677
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:19,837
Dude, you're giving her a hard
time.

678
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,339
Because I'm having a hard time!

679
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:23,132
Tell that to a therapist, or to
me.

680
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:24,551
You don't have to tell that

681
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,302
to a girl you've only known for
a night.

682
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:27,679
Is that what she told you?

683
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:30,431
Is that what she told you?

684
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,228
- That bitch.
- Csar, come here.

685
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:45,071
Can I have a scotch and Coke?

686
00:47:45,113 --> 00:47:46,114
What scotch?

687
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:51,160
- Excuse me?
- What scotch?

688
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,205
Why don't you say that

689
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:55,748
while looking at my face,
motherfucker?

690
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:02,505
Ballantine's.

691
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:28,448
- Another one.
- This one's on me.

692
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,952
- Why?
- Because.

693
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:13,034
Change that mask, dude.

694
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:01,976
- Hey.
- Hey.

695
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:06,189
- Where were you?
- Around.

696
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:08,941
Pelayo went looking for you.

697
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:13,279
Whereas I was looking for you.

698
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:14,322
What for?

699
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:17,074
Nothing in particular.

700
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:20,703
Just to... buy you a drink.

701
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:24,457
- Do you want a drink?
- No, thanks.

702
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,755
Is it too obvious I'm hitting on
you?

703
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:33,841
I just have a little problem.

704
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:38,221
A woman's harassing me and I
need to bother someone

705
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:40,348
to get rid of her. Shit!

706
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:43,643
Shit! She's coming here.

707
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:46,604
Don't look, don't look.

708
00:51:48,481 --> 00:51:51,317
You just keep talking. Pretend
that we're...

709
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,944
I mean, act like I'm here.

710
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:55,780
Keep talking... Blah, blah,
blah.

711
00:51:55,822 --> 00:52:00,701
What a nice conversation we're
having.

712
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:04,914
So, here we are.

713
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:08,292
Just talking about life...

714
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:09,544
That's enough, please.

715
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:25,059
- Where were you?
- Around.

716
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,437
I'm going to go. I'm exhausted.

717
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,398
You guys stay if you want.

718
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:40,741
This is where I leave you, guys.

719
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:43,244
I'll drive you.

720
00:52:43,286 --> 00:52:44,996
No, I live close by. I'll walk.

721
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:46,956
- My bike's right here.
- No, thanks.

722
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:48,583
- Why not?
- You don't have to.

723
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:49,709
Don't be so annoying.

724
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:53,045
- She wants to go by herself.
- Shut up, you're drunk.

725
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:56,090
I may be drunk, but I'm not an
idiot.

726
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:59,385
Besides, I'm not drunk.

727
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:01,053
Seriously, you don't have to
come with me.

728
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:04,056
- Okay, suit yourself.
- You're the one who's drunk.

729
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,101
We'll call you to hang out some
other day.

730
00:53:07,143 --> 00:53:08,144
Okay.

731
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:09,937
We could go to the movies.

732
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:11,105
- More often.
- Okay. Great.

733
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:13,316
Okay, then.

734
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:18,154
No, don't kiss me.

735
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,907
I'll intoxicate you with my
drunken breath.

736
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:24,493
Okay. I'll see you around, then.

737
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:28,664
Sure. I'll see you around.

738
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,168
I'll see you...

739
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:45,514
It's not cold at all.

740
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:54,899
Okay.

741
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:01,405
- I think I'm going to go.
- Where are you going?

742
00:54:02,615 --> 00:54:04,992
I just remembered I left my bike
somewhere else.

743
00:54:05,034 --> 00:54:06,494
Hold on, I'll go with you.

744
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:08,663
No, what for? You're almost
home, man.

745
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:10,247
Come on. See you tomorrow.

746
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:12,166
Pelayo, hold on a second.

747
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:17,922
- What?
- It's just...

748
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:26,389
- I don't know, it's just...
- Dude, you've drank too much.

749
00:54:27,098 --> 00:54:28,099
We'll talk tomorrow.

750
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,309
When I wake up tomorrow, I'll
wish I were dead.

751
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,270
Of course you won't. Get some
rest, you need it.

752
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:35,606
Pelayo...

753
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,154
You're my best friend, man.

754
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:05,386
Son of a bitch.

755
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,763
Open your eyes.

756
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:39,063
Csar.

757
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,116
It's me.

758
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:55,371
Sofa.

759
00:56:57,373 --> 00:56:59,125
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry.

760
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:01,585
What for?

761
00:57:18,144 --> 00:57:19,311
I love you.

762
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:27,278
Come here.

763
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:32,533
What's wrong?

764
00:57:33,576 --> 00:57:36,287
Nothing. I just can't believe

765
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:38,080
this is really happening.

766
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:42,084
What about Pelayo?

767
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:44,587
I don't know. He left with you,
didn't he?

768
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:47,756
Yeah, right.

769
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:54,722
Come here.

770
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:21,999
God. What a feeling.

771
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:24,335
What do you mean?

772
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:25,794
Don't you ever feel

773
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:27,379
like you've already lived a
moment?

774
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,467
- Yes.
- Why do you think that is?

775
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:35,221
They say it's a glitch in your
brain.

776
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:37,973
I've been here before.

777
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:43,229
It usually lasts a few seconds.
Then it goes away.

778
00:58:45,648 --> 00:58:46,941
I don't want it to go away.

779
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,540
I see you haven't wasted time.

780
00:59:05,251 --> 00:59:06,543
It's all I have in here.

781
00:59:09,964 --> 00:59:12,007
Gorgeous. Is it Sofa?

782
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:24,395
How much longer will I be here?

783
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:26,438
You can't ever be sure.

784
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:30,442
I'd never imagined a place like
this. It's a nightmare.

785
00:59:31,527 --> 00:59:34,363
It's a psychiatric correctional
facility.

786
00:59:37,825 --> 00:59:38,951
I shouldn't be here.

787
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:40,953
I remind you you've been charged
with murder.

788
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:43,956
- I don't even know what I did.
- Tell me.

789
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:46,458
Does the name Ellie ring a bell?

790
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:49,295
Ellie?

791
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:51,547
Do you know any girl with that
name?

792
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:54,508
No, why do you ask?

793
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:56,176
A couple of guards mentioned

794
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:58,178
that last night you kept
repeating it.

795
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:01,682
- I must have been dreaming.
- What do you dream of?

796
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:05,227
- I don't remember.
- It might be important.

797
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,314
Why would it be?

798
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:09,648
Let's see.

799
01:00:10,149 --> 01:00:12,443
I can prove you didn't know what
you were doing,

800
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:14,111
but I need an explanation

801
01:00:14,153 --> 01:00:15,529
for all this mess, whatever it
is.

802
01:00:15,571 --> 01:00:18,449
There's no explanation. I told
you the other day.

803
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:20,284
What did you dream of?

804
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,121
I don't know.

805
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:27,875
I only remember bits and pieces.

806
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:33,005
First, I'm in some kind of
office.

807
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,759
A secretary leads me to a study.

808
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:40,471
There's a picture there of a
sunset and a man.

809
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:42,973
Then...

810
01:00:43,015 --> 01:00:44,558
I don't know.

811
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,851
I'm shown a bunch of papers.

812
01:00:46,602 --> 01:00:47,603
What papers?

813
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:48,812
I don't know.

814
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,522
But I sign them.

815
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:55,110
This office you're in, is it
your company's?

816
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:57,988
No, I don't think so.

817
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:00,699
So you've dreamt of a place
you've never been before.

818
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:03,911
Well, yeah. That happens a lot,
right?

819
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:06,497
Could those papers be

820
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:08,040
the ones you signed with the
doctors?

821
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:11,126
No, the thing with the doctors
was surreal.

822
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:12,419
Why?

823
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,880
They asked me to go to the
hospital one day.

824
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,425
When I get there, the whole
surgical team is there

825
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:19,468
to welcome me.

826
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:21,720
For months...

827
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:23,472
they had stared at me,

828
01:01:23,514 --> 01:01:25,391
torn between indifference and
helplessness.

829
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:27,601
Now they were all smiles and
kindness.

830
01:01:28,394 --> 01:01:31,188
That same motherfucker who said
my case was impossible

831
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:33,273
started explaining something
about a surgery.

832
01:01:33,649 --> 01:01:35,818
They'd brought a new system to
the clinic.

833
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:37,444
Something groundbreaking.

834
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:41,156
In just half a month, they said
I could walk out of there

835
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:42,991
with a fully recomposed face.

836
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,493
You didn't believe them?

837
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:45,661
Not at first.

838
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:49,581
I thought it was just a show to
take more money from me.

839
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:52,376
But they showed me all the
paraphernalia

840
01:01:52,418 --> 01:01:53,836
they had for the surgery.

841
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:56,213
It seemed like science fiction.

842
01:01:57,256 --> 01:02:00,759
I only saw wires, buttons,
monitors.

843
01:02:01,844 --> 01:02:03,303
Truth is, I never knew

844
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:04,972
exactly what they would do to
me,

845
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,474
but I thought I had nothing to
lose.

846
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:09,560
Those people were used

847
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:12,896
to rhinoplasties, liposuctions,
micro hair grafting,

848
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:15,607
but my surgery was much more
than that.

849
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:18,068
In less than a week, my life had
taken

850
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,528
a 180 degree turn.

851
01:02:20,988 --> 01:02:23,407
One night, I was on the floor,
drunk,

852
01:02:23,449 --> 01:02:24,783
wishing I was dead...

853
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:27,494
and the next morning, my
wishes started to come true.

854
01:02:28,162 --> 01:02:29,288
Like in movies.

855
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:33,041
Sofa loves me and doctors find
a miraculous formula.

856
01:02:34,126 --> 01:02:36,879
I don't know. It makes sense I
didn't trust them.

857
01:02:37,963 --> 01:02:41,800
Didn't trust who? Didn't trust
what?

858
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:47,639
- I don't know.
- Life has many turns.

859
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,684
Happiness comes when you least
expect it.

860
01:02:54,021 --> 01:02:56,565
I once met a guy who was
completely alone,

861
01:02:56,607 --> 01:02:58,775
and suddenly, he was married
with two daughters.

862
01:02:59,902 --> 01:03:03,155
Jeez. That's your idea of
happiness?

863
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:13,999
Well, that depends on each
person.

864
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:16,126
What's happiness to you?

865
01:03:16,168 --> 01:03:18,003
What's happiness to you?

866
01:03:20,506 --> 01:03:22,633
Don't ask me that kind of
bullshit.

867
01:03:23,217 --> 01:03:26,011
But in those days, you were
happy, weren't you?

868
01:03:26,553 --> 01:03:29,056
So what? My life is shit now.

869
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:32,059
All I can do is eat, take a
dump, sleep

870
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,477
and dream of my memories.

871
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:36,939
It's good that you remember.

872
01:03:52,788 --> 01:03:55,749
- How's it going?
- What do you mean?

873
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:58,794
Don't be silly. You said they'd
remove your plates today.

874
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:03,465
- And they did.
- So?

875
01:04:04,633 --> 01:04:07,344
Well, my ears are where they
should be.

876
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:09,054
Csar, don't scare me.

877
01:04:11,557 --> 01:04:12,641
Take the plates off.

878
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:14,977
You take them off.

879
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:35,682
But how did they do it?

880
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:15,055
Hold on.

881
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:18,350
I just want to tell you that I
love you.

882
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,436
You're going too fast...

883
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:25,482
considering we met yesterday.

884
01:06:25,524 --> 01:06:27,526
Yesterday?

885
01:06:28,402 --> 01:06:30,195
My birthday was yesterday,
remember?

886
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:35,033
I met an incredible girl. Her
name's Sofa.

887
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,620
But today I woke up perfectly
fine,

888
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:40,872
and now I'm with this girl
again.

889
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:48,338
What is it?

890
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:52,384
What is it?

891
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:57,514
If you want me to move, you have
to insert a coin.

892
01:07:02,269 --> 01:07:03,812
Cling.

893
01:07:11,445 --> 01:07:13,196
It's curious. We never
appreciate

894
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:14,990
the good moments until they're
gone.

895
01:07:15,449 --> 01:07:17,325
Maybe that's why they're good.

896
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,286
Because we don't stop to think
about them.

897
01:07:20,162 --> 01:07:21,747
Maybe.

898
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:23,290
What happened with Pelayo?

899
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:24,249
What is it?

900
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:25,667
Hold on, man.

901
01:07:27,294 --> 01:07:28,670
- Ready.
- About time.

902
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:31,423
- Do you want anything else?
- No, thanks.

903
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:38,180
- How are you, Pelayo?
- Okay.

904
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:41,224
How are you, Pelayo?

905
01:07:42,893 --> 01:07:45,896
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

906
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:50,609
Believe it or not, I'm not as
screwed up as it seems.

907
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,403
I'm used to you winning all the
time, you bastard.

908
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,489
Besides, Sofa's no big deal.

909
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:57,073
You said she was the one.

910
01:07:57,115 --> 01:07:58,116
Are you sure?

911
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,536
- I must've been drunk.
- Okay.

912
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:03,955
Besides, we're friends, right?

913
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:16,384
You bastard.

914
01:08:18,637 --> 01:08:20,138
Dude, what's with your face?

915
01:08:20,472 --> 01:08:21,681
What?

916
01:08:24,643 --> 01:08:26,311
Damn, your stitches are
bursting.

917
01:08:26,353 --> 01:08:27,354
What?

918
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:35,070
You're retarded.

919
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:19,322
No!

920
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,715
What's wrong?

921
01:09:40,427 --> 01:09:41,428
I hate dreaming.

922
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:33,146
You're tickling me.

923
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:04,803
What is it?

924
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:10,183
What are you doing?

925
01:11:11,184 --> 01:11:12,602
- Where's Sofa?
- What?

926
01:11:14,813 --> 01:11:16,773
What did you do with Sofa?

927
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,778
- I'm Sofa.
- You bitch!

928
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:28,493
- You're crazy.
- Where is she?

929
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:53,476
In a moment, I'll call the
police.

930
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:55,687
You'll have lots of trouble if
Sofa doesn't turn up.

931
01:11:57,981 --> 01:11:59,441
So you survived the accident.

932
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:01,109
What accident?

933
01:12:01,151 --> 01:12:02,736
Whose body was it they found?

934
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:04,571
I didn't have an accident.

935
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:08,658
No, it wasn't an accident. It
was attempted murder.

936
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,161
Too bad you didn't see my face
after that, bitch.

937
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:13,955
Why are doing this to me? What
does it change?

938
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:14,998
Nothing.

939
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,417
You're the same psycho who
crashed my party

940
01:12:17,459 --> 01:12:18,460
to ruin my life.

941
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:20,545
I'm the same one you made love
to

942
01:12:20,587 --> 01:12:22,672
a while ago. I'm Sofa.

943
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:25,008
Don't ever say you're Sofa
again, okay?

944
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:27,343
Don't ever say that name again!

945
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:31,973
You won't tell me where she is?

946
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:35,435
You'll never tell me.

947
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:42,108
Csar...

948
01:12:45,195 --> 01:12:46,196
I love you.

949
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:52,118
- Hey.
- What's up?

950
01:12:56,915 --> 01:12:59,000
You may go. I'll continue with
him.

951
01:13:01,795 --> 01:13:05,090
Okay, let's see if I make myself
clear.

952
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:11,262
- Where were you last night?
- At my house.

953
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:12,806
I already told him.

954
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:14,099
At your house... with whom?

955
01:13:14,641 --> 01:13:15,642
With a girl.

956
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,560
The girl I questioned before?

957
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:19,104
No, that's another one.

958
01:13:19,354 --> 01:13:20,355
I was with Sofa.

959
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,941
The girl I talked to is called
Sofa.

960
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:24,734
That's what she says, but it's a
lie.

961
01:13:25,193 --> 01:13:26,194
Who is she, then?

962
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:28,571
- She's... Nuria.
- Nuria?

963
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,615
Nuria who?

964
01:13:32,659 --> 01:13:35,036
I don't know, she never told me
her last name.

965
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:36,538
Then...

966
01:13:37,664 --> 01:13:40,834
you were at your house with a
girl called Sofa.

967
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,710
- And suddenly...
- I go to the bathroom,

968
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:44,420
and when I get back, she's in
Sofa's place.

969
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:46,673
- Where is Sofa now?
- Ask Nuria.

970
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:47,757
She's posing as Sofa!

971
01:13:47,799 --> 01:13:48,800
Okay.

972
01:13:50,218 --> 01:13:51,803
You don't know her last name?

973
01:13:51,845 --> 01:13:53,555
What's wrong? Who are you going
to believe?

974
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:54,556
Her or me?

975
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:57,142
All I can say is that the girl's
papers

976
01:13:57,183 --> 01:13:59,477
are in order. We've let her go.

977
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:01,437
You let her go?

978
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:03,898
And I can assure you her name is
Sofa.

979
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:05,942
Sofa Cueto.

980
01:14:05,984 --> 01:14:08,653
She lives at 2 Quiroz Street,
second on the left.

981
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:10,280
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

982
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:13,158
I mean, yes, but that's another
girl.

983
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:14,701
I'm telling you I know the real
Sofa.

984
01:14:15,118 --> 01:14:17,120
And I'm asking you to tell me
where she is.

985
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:21,416
Because where law is concerned,
that girl you're talking about

986
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:24,252
doesn't exist except in your
imagination.

987
01:14:28,298 --> 01:14:29,799
I can't believe this is
happening.

988
01:14:29,841 --> 01:14:31,050
On the other hand,

989
01:14:31,843 --> 01:14:33,928
the girl had signs of having
been beaten up.

990
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,347
She was at my house, posing as
my girlfriend!

991
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:38,308
For some reason I can't
understand,

992
01:14:38,725 --> 01:14:40,435
she didn't want to press
charges.

993
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:42,353
I can't believe it.

994
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:44,397
So now she's the victim.

995
01:14:44,439 --> 01:14:45,440
Listen.

996
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:47,817
- Do you take drugs?
- God.

997
01:14:47,859 --> 01:14:50,612
We know you underwent
psychiatric treatment recently.

998
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,530
Because I had an accident that
wrecked my face.

999
01:14:52,572 --> 01:14:53,489
She caused it!

1000
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:55,283
From what I see, your face looks
just fine.

1001
01:14:55,325 --> 01:14:56,326
Because...

1002
01:14:57,452 --> 01:14:59,746
It doesn't matter. I won't keep
talking to you.

1003
01:15:00,288 --> 01:15:01,289
Young man.

1004
01:15:02,332 --> 01:15:04,334
I advise you to see a
psychiatrist.

1005
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:14,427
What's wrong with you?

1006
01:15:14,469 --> 01:15:15,803
What the fuck is your deal?

1007
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:18,932
- What are you talking about?
- If you wanted to dump her,

1008
01:15:18,973 --> 01:15:21,226
you didn't have to do all this,
you son of a bitch!

1009
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,103
Don't ever touch Sofa again!

1010
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:25,521
She's not Sofa, she's Nuria!

1011
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:27,023
- Nuria is dead!
- Okay.

1012
01:15:27,065 --> 01:15:30,360
Calm down unless you want to
spend the night in a cell!

1013
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:32,445
Don't ever talk to me in your
fucking life, asshole.

1014
01:15:32,487 --> 01:15:34,030
I don't know what they told you,

1015
01:15:34,072 --> 01:15:36,324
but I swear Nuria is more alive
than we are.

1016
01:15:36,366 --> 01:15:38,368
They didn't tell me anything,
Sofa did.

1017
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:39,327
Listen to me.

1018
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:41,037
You talked to her on the phone,
right?

1019
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:43,206
- Let go of me.
- She's not Sofa, Pelayo.

1020
01:15:43,248 --> 01:15:44,582
Nuria can imitate her voice!

1021
01:15:44,624 --> 01:15:46,584
She's got her documents and even
her apartment.

1022
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:48,461
She didn't tell me on the phone,
dumbass.

1023
01:15:48,503 --> 01:15:50,004
I just dropped her off at her
home.

1024
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:52,507
And she was just like this girl.

1025
01:16:00,265 --> 01:16:01,432
Nice picture, right?

1026
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:04,269
Are you going to tell me that
isn't Sofa, either?

1027
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:05,395
But this is...

1028
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:07,563
Are you pulling a prank on me or
what?

1029
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:09,607
Dude, you're not right in the
head.

1030
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,859
I'm not right in the head?

1031
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:14,320
I'm not right in the head?

1032
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:17,115
You're the ones who are crazy!

1033
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:19,367
- You're all crazy!
- Let go of me!

1034
01:16:21,661 --> 01:16:23,454
God... What's happening?

1035
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:25,748
It's my partners, isn't it?

1036
01:16:26,249 --> 01:16:28,668
They paid all of you off. This
is a fucking conspiracy!

1037
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:29,836
Look at you, man.

1038
01:16:30,295 --> 01:16:32,714
You never regained consciousness
after the accident.

1039
01:16:34,132 --> 01:16:35,133
Motherf...

1040
01:16:37,802 --> 01:16:39,053
Are you telling me...

1041
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:41,139
Are you telling me this is the
girl

1042
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,308
you ran after that night,
motherfucker?

1043
01:16:43,808 --> 01:16:45,810
- Is this the one?
- Yeah!

1044
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:48,771
You stole her from me.

1045
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,324
You need a shrink!

1046
01:17:07,165 --> 01:17:08,291
Troubles?

1047
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:12,170
I'm not in the mood for any
crap.

1048
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:14,172
There's an explanation for all
of this.

1049
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:16,132
Csar.

1050
01:17:19,886 --> 01:17:20,928
Who are you?

1051
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,638
You must have seen me on TV.

1052
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:23,723
What do you want?

1053
01:17:25,558 --> 01:17:28,603
I'm here to help you. First of
all,

1054
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:31,189
it's very important that you
calm down.

1055
01:17:31,939 --> 01:17:32,940
Calm down?

1056
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:36,736
You have to conquer your fears
and regain control.

1057
01:17:37,362 --> 01:17:39,864
What are you talking about? I'm
perfectly well, you know?

1058
01:17:39,906 --> 01:17:41,491
Who said you're not?

1059
01:17:41,783 --> 01:17:43,409
Them, everybody.

1060
01:17:44,369 --> 01:17:45,787
They say I'm crazy.

1061
01:17:46,204 --> 01:17:48,289
No, no. Of course
you're not crazy.

1062
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:53,127
But what if I told you that
you're dreaming?

1063
01:17:57,548 --> 01:18:00,385
- No, no.
- And why not?

1064
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:03,429
Look, I know what's real, and
this is real.

1065
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:06,599
How do you know? You don't know
you're dreaming

1066
01:18:06,641 --> 01:18:08,518
- until you wake up.
- I just know it.

1067
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:11,145
My dreams are a lot simpler than
this.

1068
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:13,272
There are no simple dreams.

1069
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:15,024
Look at these people.

1070
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:18,986
They seem to be talking about
their stuff, don't they?

1071
01:18:19,404 --> 01:18:21,239
Completely unaware of you.

1072
01:18:21,948 --> 01:18:25,368
Yet they may be there because
you wanted them to be.

1073
01:18:25,952 --> 01:18:28,204
In fact, you could have them...

1074
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:30,206
help you,

1075
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:32,792
or on the contrary, destroy you.

1076
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:36,045
I want them to shut up, and you,
too.

1077
01:18:51,811 --> 01:18:52,812
See?

1078
01:19:04,157 --> 01:19:05,366
What's happening here?

1079
01:19:10,121 --> 01:19:11,956
Someone tell me the truth, damn
it!

1080
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:15,751
The truth... you may not be able
to bear.

1081
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:21,924
It had to be a setup,
some big joke

1082
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:23,050
to drive me crazy.

1083
01:19:23,301 --> 01:19:25,303
They were all conspiring. Nuria,
Pelayo, the police,

1084
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:27,138
- the guy from the bar.
- Who was he?

1085
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:28,181
I don't know.

1086
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:29,974
You say you saw him on TV.

1087
01:19:30,016 --> 01:19:31,851
- On what show?
- I don't know.

1088
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:36,481
I don't know, one about freezing
dead people.

1089
01:19:36,856 --> 01:19:38,232
Freezing dead people?

1090
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:39,567
Cryonics or something.

1091
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:41,569
Like what they did to Walt
Disney.

1092
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:48,743
I may be able to help you
remember.

1093
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,120
Is that a threat?

1094
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:56,417
Lie down.

1095
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:05,092
- What's that?
- A syringe.

1096
01:20:08,763 --> 01:20:10,556
Don't worry.

1097
01:20:10,598 --> 01:20:11,724
My arm itches.

1098
01:20:12,475 --> 01:20:15,186
- It's just a sedative.
- What for?

1099
01:20:25,488 --> 01:20:27,281
All of this is a tall tale.

1100
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:28,574
If you had trusted

1101
01:20:28,616 --> 01:20:29,867
therapists a bit more,

1102
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:31,744
perhaps now you wouldn't be
where you are.

1103
01:20:34,413 --> 01:20:35,414
What's that?

1104
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:39,585
- You're making me nervous.
- You don't have to be afraid.

1105
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:41,087
I'm not afraid.

1106
01:20:41,128 --> 01:20:43,923
Stop talking and focus. Come on.

1107
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:49,345
Okay... I'm getting dizzy.

1108
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:52,306
Bye, Csar.

1109
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:58,104
Very well. Now,
let's see if you'll tell me

1110
01:20:58,145 --> 01:20:59,146
about that dream.

1111
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:01,023
Dream...

1112
01:21:01,816 --> 01:21:03,109
In my dream, it's not raining.

1113
01:21:03,818 --> 01:21:05,403
The dream about the office.

1114
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:06,571
- Ellie.
- That's right.

1115
01:21:06,988 --> 01:21:08,322
Tell me who Ellie is.

1116
01:21:08,573 --> 01:21:09,949
A secretary.

1117
01:21:09,991 --> 01:21:11,367
Ellie is a secretary?

1118
01:21:11,409 --> 01:21:13,327
She tells me to go in.

1119
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:14,328
They're waiting for me.

1120
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:15,621
Who is?

1121
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:18,374
That French guy from TV.

1122
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:20,418
Hello. Please sit down.

1123
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:23,170
A contract. Ellie.

1124
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,589
Csar, who is Ellie?

1125
01:21:27,341 --> 01:21:30,094
You won't regret it. Sign here.

1126
01:21:30,136 --> 01:21:31,470
What do you have to sign?

1127
01:21:31,512 --> 01:21:33,264
Leave it to Ellie.

1128
01:21:34,265 --> 01:21:35,600
What have you signed?

1129
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:41,814
What's wrong?

1130
01:21:42,273 --> 01:21:45,192
What's wrong, Csar? Why are you
crying?

1131
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:47,528
I'm going to die.

1132
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:50,865
You're not.

1133
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,409
- I don't know how many.
- How many what?

1134
01:21:53,451 --> 01:21:54,452
Pills.

1135
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:56,287
Hold on. You were taking pills?

1136
01:21:56,329 --> 01:21:58,414
I don't know how many I
should take.

1137
01:21:58,456 --> 01:22:00,458
You took pills to feel better?

1138
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:01,584
I don't want to...

1139
01:22:01,626 --> 01:22:03,586
On three, you're
going to wake up.

1140
01:22:03,628 --> 01:22:05,296
One, two...

1141
01:22:10,468 --> 01:22:12,678
I thought up until now you'd
told me the truth.

1142
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:16,474
What do you mean?

1143
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:18,726
You said you weren't taking
anything.

1144
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:22,229
Csar, I'm going to ask you one
last time.

1145
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:24,148
- Did you take drugs?
- Jeez.

1146
01:22:24,190 --> 01:22:25,650
Why does everyone insist...

1147
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:27,735
Don't make a fuss as usual, and
tell me the truth.

1148
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:29,987
I have to know what you were
taking.

1149
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:32,198
- I didn't take anything.
- Can't you see?

1150
01:22:32,782 --> 01:22:34,909
Your brain may have suffered
some kind of disorder

1151
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:35,910
because of the pills.

1152
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:36,994
I didn't take any pills!

1153
01:22:37,036 --> 01:22:38,579
You said you did just a moment
ago!

1154
01:22:38,829 --> 01:22:40,998
It's just a dream. Why do you
give it

1155
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,416
more importance than it has?

1156
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,543
Can't you tell apart dreams from
reality?

1157
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:45,586
I can!

1158
01:22:46,504 --> 01:22:48,506
Really? Don't make me laugh.

1159
01:22:49,632 --> 01:22:52,301
People rising from the dead?
Living people disappearing?

1160
01:22:52,343 --> 01:22:54,512
You, turning into the Phantom of
the Opera?

1161
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:00,142
Tell me one thing.

1162
01:23:00,184 --> 01:23:02,520
Do you also remember what you
did to Sofa?

1163
01:23:06,399 --> 01:23:08,442
- It wasn't Sofa.
- I don't care who she was.

1164
01:23:09,443 --> 01:23:10,736
What did you do to her?

1165
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:13,280
Do you remember?

1166
01:24:51,003 --> 01:24:53,130
Oh my God.

1167
01:24:56,634 --> 01:24:59,053
What are you doing here? I
thought you were a thief.

1168
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:03,015
Who are you?

1169
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:07,144
- I'm Sofa.
- Sofa?

1170
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:12,107
You're not Sofa.

1171
01:25:17,738 --> 01:25:19,949
Csar, all of this will be over
soon.

1172
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:22,159
We'll be together again.

1173
01:25:23,494 --> 01:25:25,496
You'll forget Nuria and I won't
be afraid of you.

1174
01:25:29,917 --> 01:25:31,877
- Then...
- I'll get some water.

1175
01:26:14,128 --> 01:26:15,129
Sofa.

1176
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:18,299
Yes, Csar, I'm Sofa.

1177
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:24,722
I'm Sofa.

1178
01:27:59,942 --> 01:28:05,239
I want to see you! I want to see
you!

1179
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:11,203
I want to see you!

1180
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:56,850
Sometimes, you dream you're with
someone.

1181
01:29:57,768 --> 01:29:59,103
For instance, your father.

1182
01:30:00,437 --> 01:30:02,564
And in just a few seconds, he
becomes your mother.

1183
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:05,651
And then... the newspaper seller
from the corner.

1184
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:08,737
And yet, you feel

1185
01:30:08,779 --> 01:30:10,364
you're talking to the same
person.

1186
01:30:12,574 --> 01:30:14,743
And although you thought you
were home, suddenly,

1187
01:30:15,077 --> 01:30:16,870
you realize you're at school...

1188
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:20,874
or in a hospital, or in jail.

1189
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:24,211
Dreams are like that.

1190
01:30:25,003 --> 01:30:27,631
And sometimes, your mind behaves
as if in a dream.

1191
01:30:28,257 --> 01:30:29,842
Do you know what alienation is?

1192
01:30:29,883 --> 01:30:32,761
Don't give me that crap. Tell me
I'm crazy if you want,

1193
01:30:32,803 --> 01:30:34,012
but this isn't alienation.

1194
01:30:34,638 --> 01:30:38,600
Then what is it? Tell me,
because I don't know.

1195
01:30:40,477 --> 01:30:42,062
I don't know what's inside here,

1196
01:30:42,104 --> 01:30:43,814
I don't know why you killed your
girlfriend,

1197
01:30:43,856 --> 01:30:44,898
I don't know who Ellie

1198
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:47,442
or that man from the TV are. I
know nothing.

1199
01:30:48,944 --> 01:30:49,987
That makes two of us.

1200
01:31:01,081 --> 01:31:02,875
Will you keep coming after the
trials?

1201
01:31:04,626 --> 01:31:06,211
I thought you didn't like me.

1202
01:31:09,006 --> 01:31:10,007
What will you testify?

1203
01:31:11,592 --> 01:31:12,759
Why are you asking me that?

1204
01:31:13,093 --> 01:31:15,304
The first hearing is next week.

1205
01:31:19,808 --> 01:31:21,310
Temporary mental alienation.

1206
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,562
I think it's the least harmful
for you.

1207
01:31:24,563 --> 01:31:26,440
It won't do much good, anyway.

1208
01:31:27,024 --> 01:31:28,775
They won't believe me that
easily.

1209
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:30,944
Even I don't believe it.

1210
01:31:31,278 --> 01:31:32,404
What do you think?

1211
01:31:34,198 --> 01:31:35,741
I think you're very sick,

1212
01:31:35,782 --> 01:31:38,452
and you should stay here for a
long time.

1213
01:31:40,037 --> 01:31:41,330
Don't worry.

1214
01:31:41,371 --> 01:31:42,873
They'll give me 20 years, at
least.

1215
01:31:43,415 --> 01:31:48,003
Csar, believe it or not, I care
about you a lot.

1216
01:31:50,589 --> 01:31:53,508
Look, kid, I'm interested in
your case.

1217
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:55,886
I'm sorry for what happened.

1218
01:31:56,303 --> 01:31:58,597
I've even come to think
someone's gaslighting you.

1219
01:31:58,931 --> 01:32:02,142
But I can't and I shouldn't
overstep my role.

1220
01:32:02,684 --> 01:32:05,062
- I'm a psychiatrist.
- You don't sound like one.

1221
01:32:05,687 --> 01:32:07,648
- What do I sound like?
- My father.

1222
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:11,193
- Lecturing me all day.
- Your father is dead.

1223
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:13,737
That's what I mean.

1224
01:32:22,537 --> 01:32:24,748
By the way, what happened to
that happy father

1225
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:26,500
with his two daughters and his
beloved wife?

1226
01:32:30,796 --> 01:32:32,464
I don't know. I never saw him
again.

1227
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:35,133
Listen to me. Hire a lawyer.

1228
01:32:35,175 --> 01:32:36,176
Bye, Csar.

1229
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:41,848
Bye.

1230
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:43,809
The main Spanish investment,

1231
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:45,769
but the most original and
emblematic.

1232
01:33:01,368 --> 01:33:03,829
He's got more
economic presence...

1233
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:05,956
depending on the period.

1234
01:33:07,541 --> 01:33:10,377
In the Roman Empire, for
instance, the normal thing

1235
01:33:10,919 --> 01:33:12,838
was to live only 25 years.

1236
01:33:15,007 --> 01:33:16,008
No!

1237
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:21,888
Who's got the remote? Who's got
the remote?

1238
01:33:22,389 --> 01:33:24,474
Give it to me!

1239
01:33:24,850 --> 01:33:28,854
Give it to me!

1240
01:33:45,287 --> 01:33:47,372
It's another way of giving
people

1241
01:33:47,414 --> 01:33:50,042
what they've been looking for
for thousands of years.

1242
01:33:51,168 --> 01:33:52,169
What's wrong?

1243
01:33:52,711 --> 01:33:55,464
There's a computer with internet
access in the Infirmary.

1244
01:33:55,505 --> 01:33:56,715
I asked to use it,

1245
01:33:56,757 --> 01:33:58,425
but you have to come with me.

1246
01:33:58,467 --> 01:33:59,885
Why do you want that?

1247
01:33:59,926 --> 01:34:01,428
I know what Ellie is. Let's go!

1248
01:34:02,012 --> 01:34:03,055
Hold on!

1249
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:05,891
Ellie isn't a person.
It's a company, damn it.

1250
01:34:06,308 --> 01:34:07,476
How do you know?

1251
01:34:07,517 --> 01:34:09,895
"Ellie" is actually "I.E."

1252
01:34:09,936 --> 01:34:11,438
It's an American company.

1253
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:13,190
What are you doing now?

1254
01:34:13,231 --> 01:34:15,275
There's a program online to
trace acronyms.

1255
01:34:15,317 --> 01:34:17,194
We'll find information about
I.E.

1256
01:34:23,116 --> 01:34:24,117
Shit.

1257
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:26,495
- We have to check one by one.
- Hold on.

1258
01:34:28,246 --> 01:34:30,415
Life extension.

1259
01:34:33,377 --> 01:34:36,296
Damn it. I have the feeling I've
done this same thing

1260
01:34:36,338 --> 01:34:37,381
before.

1261
01:34:37,422 --> 01:34:39,299
That's because of a brain
dysfunction,

1262
01:34:39,341 --> 01:34:41,218
- a brain glitch.
- No, not this time.

1263
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:43,720
God.

1264
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:45,097
This is it.

1265
01:34:45,138 --> 01:34:46,640
The photo you dreamt of?

1266
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:49,017
I can't have dreamt about it
without having seen it first,

1267
01:34:49,059 --> 01:34:50,060
right?

1268
01:34:50,394 --> 01:34:52,145
Cryonix. It's a cryonics
company.

1269
01:34:52,187 --> 01:34:53,271
I'll print it out.

1270
01:34:53,313 --> 01:34:55,023
Hold on. I'm lost now.

1271
01:34:55,357 --> 01:34:57,067
I don't understand what this has
to do

1272
01:34:57,109 --> 01:34:58,944
- with your case.
- Here's the key.

1273
01:34:58,985 --> 01:35:01,196
Look. There's a branch in
Madrid.

1274
01:35:01,571 --> 01:35:02,572
Okay.

1275
01:35:02,614 --> 01:35:05,826
- I'll go take a look.
- No, I have to go with you.

1276
01:35:06,118 --> 01:35:07,494
I can't get you out of here.

1277
01:35:07,536 --> 01:35:09,830
I know sometimes they
release you under custody.

1278
01:35:09,871 --> 01:35:11,456
Make something up so they'll let
me.

1279
01:35:11,498 --> 01:35:13,417
- It's not that easy.
- You can do it.

1280
01:35:14,084 --> 01:35:15,961
You know more than you're
letting on.

1281
01:35:18,755 --> 01:35:22,008
I know nothing. I just have a
feeling.

1282
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:23,051
What is it?

1283
01:35:23,093 --> 01:35:25,220
I have to go there, no matter
what.

1284
01:36:10,557 --> 01:36:12,100
I'm going to be very clear.

1285
01:36:12,476 --> 01:36:14,227
We're not at the hospital
anymore. I'm armed,

1286
01:36:14,269 --> 01:36:16,897
and my mission is to stop you
from doing something silly,

1287
01:36:16,938 --> 01:36:19,149
so if you do, I'll shoot you in
the ribs.

1288
01:36:53,517 --> 01:36:54,893
I've been here before.

1289
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,020
- Follow me.
- Let's go.

1290
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:14,120
You've got 20 minutes.

1291
01:37:25,674 --> 01:37:27,300
It's all like in my dream.

1292
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:34,140
Hello, good morning. How may I
help you?

1293
01:37:35,016 --> 01:37:38,812
We'd like to talk to Mr.
Duvernois.

1294
01:37:41,398 --> 01:37:42,482
This is my son.

1295
01:37:44,693 --> 01:37:46,403
He's just really shy.

1296
01:37:49,155 --> 01:37:51,324
Mr. Duvernois isn't here right
now.

1297
01:37:51,783 --> 01:37:52,951
But first of all,

1298
01:37:52,993 --> 01:37:54,536
you already know what cryonics
are.

1299
01:37:55,036 --> 01:37:56,246
More or less.

1300
01:37:56,288 --> 01:37:58,456
Here are some explanatory
leaflets.

1301
01:37:58,957 --> 01:38:01,418
You can read them in the waiting
room.

1302
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:03,295
One of my colleagues will be
with you shortly.

1303
01:38:03,962 --> 01:38:04,963
Thank you.

1304
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:06,840
"Live limitlessly.

1305
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:08,341
The future is for the
foresighted."

1306
01:38:09,009 --> 01:38:11,011
What is this? Some kind of cult?

1307
01:38:11,052 --> 01:38:12,137
"Cryonics."

1308
01:38:12,178 --> 01:38:14,681
It's the Biostasis or
preservation of humans

1309
01:38:14,723 --> 01:38:15,849
under cold temperatures.

1310
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:18,101
Biostasis is the bridge to take
our patients

1311
01:38:18,143 --> 01:38:19,853
to a time in the future when
technology

1312
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:21,521
"will allow for their
resuscitation."

1313
01:38:25,942 --> 01:38:27,485
You pay to live forever.

1314
01:38:31,114 --> 01:38:32,866
Jules Verne was laughed at, too.

1315
01:38:33,158 --> 01:38:36,703
Csar, all of this is absolutely
impossible.

1316
01:38:36,745 --> 01:38:38,663
How do you know? Have you been
to the future?

1317
01:38:39,164 --> 01:38:41,291
This company promises the same
thing the Church has

1318
01:38:41,333 --> 01:38:42,334
for centuries.

1319
01:38:42,375 --> 01:38:44,919
Immortality. Only instead of
priests, they are quacks.

1320
01:38:44,961 --> 01:38:46,671
What's that got to do with you?

1321
01:38:47,088 --> 01:38:49,382
You're not cryogenized. You're
alive.

1322
01:38:49,674 --> 01:38:52,552
Here's the contract, if you want
to look at it.

1323
01:38:54,137 --> 01:38:55,347
The process is very simple.

1324
01:38:55,388 --> 01:38:57,015
You can die anytime.

1325
01:38:57,057 --> 01:38:58,725
Today, tomorrow or in 20 years.

1326
01:38:58,767 --> 01:38:59,809
We don't care about that.

1327
01:39:00,518 --> 01:39:01,936
From the moment

1328
01:39:01,978 --> 01:39:03,563
you're pronounced legally dead,

1329
01:39:03,605 --> 01:39:05,774
Life Extension takes over your
body and takes it

1330
01:39:05,815 --> 01:39:07,442
to our warehouse in Arizona.

1331
01:39:07,692 --> 01:39:10,111
There, you're frozen at 108.4
degrees below zero.

1332
01:39:10,153 --> 01:39:12,364
This is what we call total
suspension,

1333
01:39:12,405 --> 01:39:14,616
and it costs $240,000, from
which...

1334
01:39:14,991 --> 01:39:17,494
thirty thousand is allocated
to the freezing process,

1335
01:39:17,535 --> 01:39:19,663
and the rest is placed in an
investment fund

1336
01:39:19,704 --> 01:39:22,499
so the interest can cover the
maintenance costs

1337
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:25,377
and the resuscitation costs when
this becomes possible.

1338
01:39:26,211 --> 01:39:27,545
If it becomes possible.

1339
01:39:27,587 --> 01:39:29,255
Frankly, we believe

1340
01:39:29,297 --> 01:39:30,590
resuscitating dead people

1341
01:39:30,632 --> 01:39:31,800
will be possible someday.

1342
01:39:31,841 --> 01:39:33,426
- What's this?
- What?

1343
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:36,388
Clause 14. Artificial
perception.

1344
01:39:36,429 --> 01:39:38,390
Yes, that's another possibility

1345
01:39:38,431 --> 01:39:40,141
we haven't fully developed yet.

1346
01:39:40,934 --> 01:39:42,852
Look. This is a life.

1347
01:39:43,812 --> 01:39:45,689
Birth and death.

1348
01:39:46,314 --> 01:39:48,858
Imagine you suffer from a
terminal disease.

1349
01:39:49,234 --> 01:39:50,860
Naturally, you want to keep on
living,

1350
01:39:50,902 --> 01:39:52,737
but you don't wish to live in
the future.

1351
01:39:53,113 --> 01:39:55,490
You're not interested. You want
to keep on living

1352
01:39:55,532 --> 01:39:57,242
your current life, in the
present.

1353
01:39:57,283 --> 01:40:00,412
Okay, so you die, we freeze you,

1354
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:02,580
and when we're capable of
resuscitating you,

1355
01:40:02,622 --> 01:40:04,207
we commit to make you live...

1356
01:40:06,084 --> 01:40:07,085
a dream.

1357
01:40:08,586 --> 01:40:09,546
A dream?

1358
01:40:09,587 --> 01:40:11,214
We'll reenact everything so it
seems real.

1359
01:40:11,798 --> 01:40:13,675
Your family members, your
friends, your city,

1360
01:40:14,008 --> 01:40:15,885
the whole world, including this
office.

1361
01:40:15,927 --> 01:40:17,554
But it'll be just a virtual
reality.

1362
01:40:18,138 --> 01:40:20,598
Besides, we'll make sure you
don't remember dying.

1363
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:23,268
Or signing this contract, of
course.

1364
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:25,019
- How?
- Very simple.

1365
01:40:25,979 --> 01:40:27,397
By erasing it from your memory.

1366
01:40:27,439 --> 01:40:30,400
Thus, you'll live linearly, as
if nothing had happened.

1367
01:40:30,442 --> 01:40:32,652
And you'll live it as you see
fit.

1368
01:40:32,694 --> 01:40:34,154
At will.

1369
01:40:34,988 --> 01:40:36,698
You will decide at all times.

1370
01:40:37,031 --> 01:40:39,784
But... what would happen if
there was a glitch?

1371
01:40:40,869 --> 01:40:41,911
What if the dream...

1372
01:40:41,953 --> 01:40:44,330
What if the dream became a
nightmare?

1373
01:40:44,372 --> 01:40:46,916
Your subconscious can always
play

1374
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:48,126
a dirty trick on you, but...

1375
01:40:48,626 --> 01:40:50,295
we're not sloppy, you know.

1376
01:40:50,336 --> 01:40:53,173
We're a serious company, and the
VR technology

1377
01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:55,550
progresses by leaps and bounds.

1378
01:40:56,134 --> 01:40:59,012
Look... honestly,

1379
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:03,767
signing clause 14 is basically
signing up for paradise.

1380
01:41:04,851 --> 01:41:06,186
I know it's hard to believe.

1381
01:41:07,687 --> 01:41:10,398
But Jules Verne was laughed at,
too, wasn't he?

1382
01:41:15,653 --> 01:41:16,654
Excuse me.

1383
01:41:21,618 --> 01:41:23,328
Where do you think you're going?

1384
01:41:23,369 --> 01:41:25,830
- To the restroom.
- I'll keep an eye on you.

1385
01:41:25,872 --> 01:41:26,873
I'm with him.

1386
01:41:27,207 --> 01:41:28,875
He's dizzy, there's nothing to
worry about.

1387
01:41:35,548 --> 01:41:37,300
Csar, please calm down.

1388
01:41:37,342 --> 01:41:38,593
This is a dream.

1389
01:41:38,885 --> 01:41:39,928
It's the only explanation.

1390
01:41:39,969 --> 01:41:41,805
It's not a dream. What he said
is impossible.

1391
01:41:41,846 --> 01:41:44,516
It's impossible now, not in the
30th century!

1392
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:45,809
This isn't the 30th century!

1393
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:48,144
- This is 1997.
- That's what it seems.

1394
01:41:48,186 --> 01:41:50,188
- It's what I paid for.
- Listen.

1395
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:52,065
This isn't a dream. Look at me.

1396
01:41:52,106 --> 01:41:55,527
If this is a dream, I don't have
a life of my own, I'm a lie!

1397
01:41:55,568 --> 01:41:57,445
- You're only in my head.
- No!

1398
01:41:57,904 --> 01:42:00,907
- Csar, I'm real.
- How do I know that?

1399
01:42:01,491 --> 01:42:03,493
Can't you tell dreams from
reality?

1400
01:42:03,952 --> 01:42:07,539
Does this look like a dream?
Tell me, does it?

1401
01:42:10,542 --> 01:42:13,002
I'm working very hard on this
case.

1402
01:42:13,044 --> 01:42:14,045
I'm risking...

1403
01:42:14,087 --> 01:42:16,673
I haven't killed anyone. It's
all a nightmare!

1404
01:42:16,714 --> 01:42:18,216
Trust me, damn it!

1405
01:42:19,217 --> 01:42:21,427
- It's not a dream.
- They're wrong.

1406
01:42:21,469 --> 01:42:23,221
- Who?
- I don't know, damn it.

1407
01:42:23,263 --> 01:42:25,807
Those who programmed this
confused Sofa with Nuria!

1408
01:42:25,849 --> 01:42:27,350
They're not showing me my real
face!

1409
01:42:27,392 --> 01:42:30,311
I'm sick of hearing that. Your
face is perfectly fine.

1410
01:42:30,353 --> 01:42:32,188
The guard is right. You act like
a child

1411
01:42:32,230 --> 01:42:33,815
hiding behind that mask.

1412
01:42:33,857 --> 01:42:35,942
What game are you playing? Take
that off already.

1413
01:42:35,984 --> 01:42:38,194
- I don't want to.
- I don't care what you want.

1414
01:42:38,236 --> 01:42:40,363
- I want to see you.
- Don't you realize?

1415
01:42:40,405 --> 01:42:42,657
It doesn't matter what you see,
but what I see!

1416
01:42:42,699 --> 01:42:43,658
It's my dream!

1417
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:46,619
If you say it's a dream again,
I'll have you committed.

1418
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:49,998
Enough of that. Show me your
face now.

1419
01:42:50,456 --> 01:42:51,499
You owe me that.

1420
01:43:12,645 --> 01:43:15,648
Csar, please look yourself in
the mirror

1421
01:43:15,690 --> 01:43:17,734
and tell me if you really think
you're disfigured.

1422
01:43:22,614 --> 01:43:25,658
God, why do you insist on seeing
something that's not there?

1423
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:28,119
- You're perfectly fine.
- I'm a monster.

1424
01:43:28,161 --> 01:43:29,537
What are you talking about?

1425
01:43:29,579 --> 01:43:31,789
Many would trade their face for
yours.

1426
01:43:31,831 --> 01:43:34,667
You're completely normal. Forget
normal!

1427
01:43:34,709 --> 01:43:36,252
- You're handsome!
- No!

1428
01:43:37,503 --> 01:43:39,756
Csar, listen to me. Maybe what
you're going through

1429
01:43:39,797 --> 01:43:41,591
- is like anorexia.
- No.

1430
01:43:41,633 --> 01:43:43,426
Some girls insist on believing
they're fat,

1431
01:43:43,468 --> 01:43:45,470
- and they end up going crazy!
- No!

1432
01:43:45,511 --> 01:43:46,763
Csar!

1433
01:43:48,139 --> 01:43:49,432
I want to wake up!

1434
01:43:50,642 --> 01:43:52,685
I want to wake up!

1435
01:43:53,019 --> 01:43:55,355
I want to wake up!

1436
01:43:57,398 --> 01:43:58,775
Shit!

1437
01:43:59,692 --> 01:44:02,320
- Stand still!
- Don't shoot!

1438
01:44:04,906 --> 01:44:06,574
It's a nightmare.

1439
01:44:18,836 --> 01:44:21,631
Hold on a second, you! You can't
get out of here!

1440
01:44:22,632 --> 01:44:23,967
Stop!

1441
01:44:33,476 --> 01:44:34,811
Hey, hold on!

1442
01:44:50,952 --> 01:44:52,996
It's a dream.

1443
01:44:53,037 --> 01:44:54,831
It's a dream.

1444
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:12,932
Don't move!

1445
01:45:16,019 --> 01:45:17,020
Drop the weapon!

1446
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:20,314
I want to wake up.

1447
01:45:20,898 --> 01:45:22,483
I want to wake up.

1448
01:45:22,525 --> 01:45:24,986
- Don't move!
- I want to wake up!

1449
01:45:25,028 --> 01:45:27,572
I want to wake up! I want to
wake up!

1450
01:45:36,664 --> 01:45:37,665
Antonio.

1451
01:45:40,585 --> 01:45:43,755
- Antonio.
- What?

1452
01:45:45,173 --> 01:45:46,674
You're crushing me.

1453
01:45:48,634 --> 01:45:50,511
I think I shouldn't move,
considering

1454
01:45:50,553 --> 01:45:52,096
I've been shot in my back.

1455
01:45:53,848 --> 01:45:54,891
How do you know that?

1456
01:45:57,185 --> 01:45:58,227
Well...

1457
01:45:59,854 --> 01:46:00,855
because...

1458
01:46:15,078 --> 01:46:16,412
What the hell is going on here?

1459
01:46:17,830 --> 01:46:19,248
What the hell is going on here?

1460
01:46:19,582 --> 01:46:20,875
- Damn it!
- I told you.

1461
01:46:21,459 --> 01:46:23,544
- It's all a dream.
- Shut up.

1462
01:46:25,338 --> 01:46:26,339
Okay.

1463
01:46:26,506 --> 01:46:28,049
I know what this is.

1464
01:46:28,091 --> 01:46:30,426
It's one of those hidden camera
pranks from TV.

1465
01:46:31,302 --> 01:46:33,387
Very good, seriously! You've
done an awesome job,

1466
01:46:33,429 --> 01:46:35,014
I loved it, but that's enough!

1467
01:46:35,056 --> 01:46:36,766
- There's someone there.
- Where?

1468
01:46:37,183 --> 01:46:40,478
- Up there, on the rooftop.
- I don't see anyone.

1469
01:46:42,897 --> 01:46:43,898
Where are you going?

1470
01:46:46,901 --> 01:46:49,695
Come on, Antonio, stop going
round and round.

1471
01:46:50,488 --> 01:46:52,073
Otherwise, you'll go crazy.

1472
01:47:07,672 --> 01:47:08,673
Hello, Csar.

1473
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:13,136
I think it's about time I
introduce myself.

1474
01:47:13,427 --> 01:47:14,804
My name is Serge Duvernois.

1475
01:47:14,846 --> 01:47:16,848
I'm a Life Extension
representative.

1476
01:47:17,306 --> 01:47:20,977
We met... 150 years ago.

1477
01:47:21,018 --> 01:47:22,186
That's nonsense!

1478
01:47:22,228 --> 01:47:24,021
Has the entire world gone mad?

1479
01:47:24,063 --> 01:47:25,273
There is no world.

1480
01:47:25,314 --> 01:47:27,400
Everything that exists is inside
this man's mind.

1481
01:47:28,484 --> 01:47:30,403
- Including you and me.
- Sure.

1482
01:47:30,444 --> 01:47:32,446
I'll kick your ass and see if it
hurts.

1483
01:47:32,488 --> 01:47:33,489
Try it.

1484
01:47:33,823 --> 01:47:35,449
They can make you disappear

1485
01:47:35,491 --> 01:47:37,743
right now, like every other
person.

1486
01:47:37,785 --> 01:47:39,579
And may I ask who "they" are?

1487
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:42,415
They are the company, Life
Extension.

1488
01:47:43,124 --> 01:47:44,917
They know everything we're
saying,

1489
01:47:45,501 --> 01:47:49,672
they even know what's going
through Csar's mind right now,

1490
01:47:49,714 --> 01:47:51,382
an instant after he thinks about
it.

1491
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:52,592
Then tell me.

1492
01:47:52,633 --> 01:47:55,178
Why haven't they made me
disappear yet?

1493
01:47:55,219 --> 01:47:57,096
It would be virtually incorrect.

1494
01:47:57,138 --> 01:47:59,390
Considering you just saved his
life.

1495
01:47:59,432 --> 01:48:01,142
"Virtually incorrect"?

1496
01:48:01,434 --> 01:48:03,853
Do you think I'm an idiot?

1497
01:48:03,895 --> 01:48:05,771
No, on the contrary. You're a
great guy.

1498
01:48:06,856 --> 01:48:09,317
And a very necessary character
for Csar.

1499
01:48:10,568 --> 01:48:11,694
A character.

1500
01:48:13,821 --> 01:48:14,739
Where are you going?

1501
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:16,699
- To look for someone.
- There's no one left.

1502
01:48:16,741 --> 01:48:18,367
People are no longer necessary.

1503
01:48:27,335 --> 01:48:28,920
Why didn't you wake me up
before?

1504
01:48:30,129 --> 01:48:31,255
You just had to ask.

1505
01:48:32,089 --> 01:48:34,800
Of course, this was extremely
difficult,

1506
01:48:34,842 --> 01:48:36,969
since technically, you weren't
supposed to know

1507
01:48:37,011 --> 01:48:38,054
you were dreaming.

1508
01:48:38,304 --> 01:48:39,472
Since when?

1509
01:48:39,513 --> 01:48:41,432
Remember that day at the club?

1510
01:48:42,433 --> 01:48:45,478
That night, when you fell asleep
on the sidewalk,

1511
01:48:45,728 --> 01:48:47,980
was the one chosen to make the
connection.

1512
01:48:48,314 --> 01:48:49,440
What connection?

1513
01:48:49,482 --> 01:48:50,733
The connection

1514
01:48:50,775 --> 01:48:52,818
between your real life and your
virtual one.

1515
01:48:53,694 --> 01:48:57,031
A connection lasting 150 years,
whose passing you didn't feel

1516
01:48:57,073 --> 01:48:59,492
because you were dead and
frozen.

1517
01:49:00,993 --> 01:49:03,454
When you woke up, nothing was
real anymore.

1518
01:49:05,706 --> 01:49:08,084
We erased what actually happened
from your memory.

1519
01:49:09,835 --> 01:49:10,836
What actually happened?

1520
01:49:12,296 --> 01:49:14,006
You never saw Sofa again.

1521
01:49:15,007 --> 01:49:18,135
And the doctors were never able
to reconstruct your face.

1522
01:49:19,095 --> 01:49:22,848
You woke up on that street with
an awful hangover.

1523
01:49:23,724 --> 01:49:25,601
You locked yourself up in your
place for months.

1524
01:49:26,269 --> 01:49:28,854
Until one day, you learned of
our existence.

1525
01:49:28,896 --> 01:49:33,317
You came to the office, you
signed the contract, and...

1526
01:49:35,444 --> 01:49:36,445
you killed yourself.

1527
01:49:38,864 --> 01:49:40,074
And I paid for this?

1528
01:49:41,242 --> 01:49:43,953
I paid for Nuria to be
resuscitated as Sofa?

1529
01:49:44,787 --> 01:49:47,581
I paid for my face to be
monstrous again?

1530
01:49:47,623 --> 01:49:49,292
I paid to live this nightmare?

1531
01:49:49,333 --> 01:49:51,544
You paid to live whatever you
wanted to.

1532
01:49:52,128 --> 01:49:55,089
We just added the setting and
the characters.

1533
01:49:55,131 --> 01:49:56,966
Your hell was of your own
invention.

1534
01:49:57,008 --> 01:49:59,093
I tried to warn you at that bar.

1535
01:49:59,802 --> 01:50:01,887
I told you everything depended
on your mind.

1536
01:50:02,847 --> 01:50:04,307
I just have to wish for it.

1537
01:50:05,850 --> 01:50:07,435
For instance, can Antonio come
back now?

1538
01:50:07,476 --> 01:50:09,103
There's no one in the building!

1539
01:50:09,353 --> 01:50:12,565
You couldn't have made four
million people disappear!

1540
01:50:14,275 --> 01:50:15,818
You've overcome your fears.

1541
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:18,029
If you want, we can give it
another try

1542
01:50:18,362 --> 01:50:20,364
and make you like the best of
dreams,

1543
01:50:20,698 --> 01:50:22,616
with money, with friends, with
Sofa

1544
01:50:22,658 --> 01:50:24,201
or any girl you want.

1545
01:50:24,744 --> 01:50:25,911
You just have to ask.

1546
01:50:29,332 --> 01:50:31,959
- I don't want to dream anymore.
- It's not a dream!

1547
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:34,670
Csar, listen to me.

1548
01:50:35,171 --> 01:50:37,298
This is real. This guy is a
fraud.

1549
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:39,050
Let's go find people on the
street.

1550
01:50:40,092 --> 01:50:42,261
Don't listen to him. It makes
sense he acts this way,

1551
01:50:42,303 --> 01:50:45,306
but it's all a show. In reality,
he feels nothing.

1552
01:50:45,973 --> 01:50:47,516
I feel nothing?

1553
01:50:47,558 --> 01:50:49,727
I feel nothing, you son of a
bitch?

1554
01:50:50,102 --> 01:50:51,437
What do you know?

1555
01:50:51,479 --> 01:50:53,147
Don't listen to him. He's not
real.

1556
01:50:53,189 --> 01:50:55,232
Yes, I am real!

1557
01:50:55,900 --> 01:50:58,319
I have a wife and two daughters.

1558
01:50:58,361 --> 01:51:00,988
His personality was designed so
that he will say

1559
01:51:01,030 --> 01:51:02,323
what he's saying right now.

1560
01:51:02,365 --> 01:51:03,616
Where are my daughters?

1561
01:51:04,617 --> 01:51:05,534
God.

1562
01:51:05,576 --> 01:51:08,412
Csar, the company
offers you another chance.

1563
01:51:08,454 --> 01:51:11,791
In 1997, it was impossible to
reconstruct your face.

1564
01:51:11,832 --> 01:51:15,461
But out there, it's the year
2145.

1565
01:51:15,503 --> 01:51:18,923
You wouldn't believe the things
surgery can do.

1566
01:51:19,423 --> 01:51:22,301
If you want, you can wake up and
live in the future

1567
01:51:22,343 --> 01:51:24,136
like a normal person.

1568
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:27,264
- In the future?
- You have to choose.

1569
01:51:31,102 --> 01:51:32,436
How could I wake up?

1570
01:51:33,312 --> 01:51:35,981
How would you wake up from your
worst nightmare?

1571
01:51:42,947 --> 01:51:44,949
No, Csar, stop listening to
him!

1572
01:51:44,990 --> 01:51:46,659
It's all set up by your
partners!

1573
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:48,202
They want you to kill yourself!

1574
01:51:48,244 --> 01:51:49,703
He already killed himself once.

1575
01:51:50,246 --> 01:51:51,747
It'll be a mere formality now.

1576
01:51:53,207 --> 01:51:54,208
I'm going to do it.

1577
01:51:55,251 --> 01:51:59,755
Okay. Any wishes before...

1578
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:01,257
you die?

1579
01:52:15,438 --> 01:52:17,148
That people out there can read
my mind.

1580
01:53:22,421 --> 01:53:25,591
- Who are you?
- I don't know.

1581
01:53:27,051 --> 01:53:30,638
Don't suffer anymore. It's all
in your head.

1582
01:53:30,888 --> 01:53:32,431
It's all psychological.

1583
01:53:58,874 --> 01:53:59,917
Come on, Csar.

1584
01:54:14,390 --> 01:54:16,141
What will happen to them once I
wake up?

1585
01:54:16,183 --> 01:54:17,768
Extending this goodbye is
useless.

1586
01:54:18,227 --> 01:54:20,688
You think they're your friends,
but they're just images.

1587
01:54:21,564 --> 01:54:23,524
That man isn't really crying.

1588
01:54:47,172 --> 01:54:49,008
I didn't remember that I suffer
from vertigo.

1589
01:54:49,883 --> 01:54:51,051
Then don't look.

1590
01:54:53,679 --> 01:54:54,763
Goodbye, Csar.

1591
01:55:31,967 --> 01:55:33,052
No!

1592
01:55:38,432 --> 01:55:39,475
Easy.

1593
01:55:42,102 --> 01:55:43,103
Easy.

1594
01:55:46,023 --> 01:55:47,066
Open your eyes.
