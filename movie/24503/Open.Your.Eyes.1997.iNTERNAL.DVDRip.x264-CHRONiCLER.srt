1
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,400
Open your eyes.

2
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,595
Open your eyes.

3
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,669
Open your eyes.

4
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,989
Open your eyes.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,195
Open your eyes.

6
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,349
Open your eyes.

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,509
Open your eyes.

8
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,909
Open your eyes.

9
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,035
Open your eyes.

10
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,279
Why tell me that dream?

11
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,915
You said I could tell you
whatever I wanted.

12
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,113
All right. Anything else you
should tell me before we start?

13
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,233
Nothing you don't know. I was
about to turn twenty five...

14
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,558
I liked eating, sleeping,
making love, like everyone.

15
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,229
And you know what everyone
does when they get up.

16
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,636
Where are you going?

17
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,551
Out.

18
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,751
Stop leaving messages
on the alarm.

19
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,871
Why?

20
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,951
Just don't.

21
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,673
Because it pisses me off.

22
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,234
Come on, for fuck's sake!

23
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,235
- I'll slaughter you!
- We'll see about that.

24
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,792
You've got three cars, why do
we always go in this wreck?

25
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,270
Come on, I'm in a hurry.

26
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,115
Are you backing out?
I skipped class for this.

27
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,757
I'm seeing my partners after.
Why do you think I'm dressed up?

28
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,270
So you can shout at them.
You like that.

29
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,830
I don't shout.

30
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,716
- So tell me, did you screw her?
- Screw who?

31
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,832
Whoever was there
when I rang last night.

32
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,232
I was alone last night.
Anyway, what is it to you?

33
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,671
Nothing, you can do what
you want with your life.

34
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,155
Thanks very much.

35
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,319
Let's change the subject.

36
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,436
Did you screw her?

37
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,592
Give me a break,
I was on my own.

38
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,713
So, you did. Was it the one
you talk so much about?

39
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,599
- Who?
- That Nuria.

40
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,599
My God, I can't believe it!

41
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,917
César seeing
the same woman twice!

42
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,635
- She must be great in bed.
- She isn't bad.

43
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,520
Bastard! When are you going
to tell me the secret?

44
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,558
- What secret?
- The recipe for Coca-Cola.

45
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,150
- Look, the kind you like.
- Yeah, change the...

46
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,073
What did you eat today?

47
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,960
Nothing, that's my problem,
I'm starved!

48
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,952
It's funny when you ask them
what they value most in a man.

49
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,997
I like him to be intelligent,
to be honest, to be kind...

50
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,190
It's all shit!

51
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,437
You'd have problems
if you were like me.

52
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,592
Not that again!
You aren't ugly.

53
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,269
Anybody would like to have
your face. You're normal.

54
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,671
Normal! That doesn't mean
I'm handsome.

55
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,956
You're handsome.

56
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,675
I'm acceptable,
when you're not beside me.

57
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,560
You're like anorexics.

58
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,752
They insist they're fat,
and end up crazy.

59
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,436
When some girl ties you down,
the rest of us will get a chance.

60
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,199
- Yeah, yeah.
- Why not?

61
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,114
If you meet the right girl...

62
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,074
She doesn't exist.

63
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,551
Shit!

64
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,640
How did I miss that?

65
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,830
God punished you.

66
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,716
You're for it.

67
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,157
- Who are you saying that to?
- To God.

68
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,360
Do you believe in God?

69
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,518
Don't start all that shit.

70
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,353
I just asked a question.

71
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,032
If you don't want to,
don't answer.

72
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,474
I don't believe in God.

73
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,797
How do you explain
what happened?

74
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,636
How do you mean?

75
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,351
Your face.

76
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,433
There is no explanation.

77
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,640
- I believe there is.
- You believe I'm mad.

78
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,639
I only believe what I see.

79
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,877
You haven't let me see
your face yet.

80
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,070
And I won't.

81
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,029
Do you really think
you're a monster, César?

82
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,114
Come on, let me see.

83
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,039
Stick your hand up your ass!

84
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,880
Take it easy, brat!
I'm sick of all your stories!

85
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,991
Leave me alone!

86
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,839
I'll kick that shit out of you!

87
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,076
Leave me alone!

88
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,154
I can't work with you in here.
Leave us on our own.

89
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,800
On my responsibility.

90
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,512
You're just a spoilt brat,
who...

91
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,558
My parents are dead, asshole!

92
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,514
You made up a story so as
not to admit what you did.

93
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,470
Is that true?

94
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,671
What?

95
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,638
That you're a spoilt brat.

96
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,677
My father had a restaurant
chain. That's not my fault.

97
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,593
When did your parents die?

98
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,231
15 years ago...

99
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,875
in an accident.

100
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,431
- And now you're rich.
- So they say.

101
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,196
Then why don't
you want a lawyer?

102
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,152
They say they can get me
the best.

103
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,397
But they want me
stuck here forever.

104
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,511
Who are they?

105
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,316
My partners. They've been sucking
my blood since I was a kid.

106
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,671
Now they've got everything.
They've cut me out.

107
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,998
It wasn't them.
It was me.

108
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,436
I don't care.

109
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,829
Let's see, César.
Do you know why you're here?

110
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,990
- Because I wear a mask, I guess.
- No.

111
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,558
Because you killed someone.

112
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,320
Or don't you remember?

113
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,512
Tell me, don't you remember?

114
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,631
Fuck, stop it!

115
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,111
We must get things clear
if you want us to get on.

116
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,714
I don't want us to get on!

117
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,919
Is your solution to sit
in this hole and not talk?

118
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,476
- Aren't we talking now?
- After two months.

119
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,359
I've been trying for two months.

120
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,557
- Read the reports.
- I've read them.

121
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,400
I want you to tell me,
if possible, sitting on a chair.

122
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,000
Or are you going to stay there?

123
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,075
I like the floor.

124
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,677
It's the only thing
that seems real.

125
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,638
What does everything else seem?

126
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,873
Everything else is a lie.

127
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,994
All this seems a lie.

128
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,356
Including you.

129
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,433
You don't even wear
a white coat.

130
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,400
Do you think I should?

131
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,830
Doctors wear them.

132
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,992
I took it off so you'd forget
I was a doctor.

133
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,352
So that you'd like me more.

134
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,836
It didn't work.
I hate the sight of you.

135
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,713
Now that we're friends...

136
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,429
- I've got no friends.
- Tell me what happened.

137
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,996
The sooner you talk,
the sooner I'll go.

138
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,191
Hey! Happy birthday and all
the things people usually say.

139
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,033
Thank you, thank you.

140
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,834
- Where did you find her?
- In the library.

141
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,396
- She tried to steal my book.
- It was mine.

142
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,591
Anyway...

143
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,473
- César, Sofia.
- Hello.

144
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,116
Happy birthday.

145
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,839
- Thank you.
- Your present.

146
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,075
- Thanks a lot.
- We bought it between us.

147
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,838
Then I have to thank
both of you.

148
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,353
Stop chatting her up
and open it.

149
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,631
- I'd rather open them tomorrow.
- Whatever.

150
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,160
- Like a drink?
- Sure.

151
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,476
I'll leave this upstairs.

152
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,671
Hello.

153
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,955
What are you doing here?

154
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,550
- Happy birthday, darling.
- Thank you.

155
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,432
But I didn't ask you
to the party.

156
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,560
That was nice of you.

157
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,833
I brought you a present too.

158
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,150
Why not open it?

159
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,435
No, thanks. I already know
what's inside.

160
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,319
- And last night?
- Listen, Nuria.

161
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,791
I don't like you just turning up,
much less coming into my room.

162
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,469
- Well, do I have to apologize?
- No.

163
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,716
You have to go.

164
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,319
Right, I know what it is.

165
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,194
You don't want to be seen twice
with the same girl.

166
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,517
It would ruin your reputation.

167
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,875
You got it in one.

168
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,560
And there's someone else.

169
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,876
- Right.
- Who?

170
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,919
The brunette you were
talking to a minute ago?

171
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,555
Well, she's not bad.

172
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,470
I don't care.

173
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,437
I don't need to be seen
with you.

174
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,877
Hold me.

175
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,431
Come on.

176
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,550
A little kiss.

177
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,351
Come on.

178
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,510
Until when?

179
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,434
Until next Friday?

180
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,871
Can you manage
a weekend without me?

181
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,277
Excuse me, I must see
to my guests.

182
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,871
Yes, the brunette will take time.
She looks that type.

183
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,436
- That type?
- Yes.

184
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,791
The kind who can't find
your zipper.

185
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,911
Hello.

186
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,271
Hello.

187
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,030
What did you want?

188
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,119
- To open this.
- Wait.

189
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,276
I'll serve you.

190
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,998
Since when are you the waiter?

191
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,193
Don't you know I'm in catering?

192
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,830
Are you all right?

193
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,718
Can you tell I'm elbowing in?

194
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,471
A bit.

195
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,514
I've got a slight problem.
A girl's chasing me.

196
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,631
You don't say.

197
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,832
I need some help
to get rid of her.

198
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,440
And I'm that help.

199
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,040
- Shit, there she is!
- Where?

200
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,516
Don't look, don't look.
Look over here.

201
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,671
That's it.

202
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,831
Yes.

203
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,351
Yes, yes, yes.

204
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,396
Here we are.

205
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,916
Here we are.

206
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,237
Well...

207
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,392
Act as if we were talking about
something real interesting.

208
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,191
Nod your head, agree, say yes.

209
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,477
You know.

210
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,117
- What a nice conversation.
- Yes.

211
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,999
And she's coming this way.

212
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,071
Fuck!

213
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,200
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry, I'll guide you.

214
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,198
- Straight on.
- I don't see her.

215
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,551
Here it is.

216
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,951
Go right in.

217
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,395
I'm not going in there.

218
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,829
Well, I am. So long.

219
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,149
- He's in here.
- You...!

220
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,631
Well...

221
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,431
We're safe.

222
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,357
But we've got nothing
to drink here.

223
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,075
I think all you really want
is to chat me up.

224
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,237
Yes, that too.

225
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,920
First, I want to save my skin.

226
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,278
Can't you say
you aren't interested?

227
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,556
She wouldn't care.

228
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,796
She never gets tired.

229
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,673
- She must be feeling bad.
- Yeah.

230
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,791
Of course.

231
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,596
So you're studying Drama,
like Pelayo?

232
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,916
For now.

233
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,236
Scenography?

234
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,959
- Acting.
- Really?

235
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,150
To be an actress?

236
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,591
I am an actress.
Is that a problem?

237
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,431
Yes.

238
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,950
Aren't you ashamed?

239
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,834
Ashamed? Why should
I be ashamed?

240
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,714
Actors aren't honest.

241
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,879
You're able to show
emotions you don't have...

242
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,958
or which, at most,
you invent.

243
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,237
Right now, you could
be thinking...

244
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,040
This guy's a real drag.
How can I dump him?

245
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,640
- Really?
- And in catering.

246
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,150
A pain in the ass.

247
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,791
But you're a good actress,
it doesn't show.

248
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,875
Hey, Pelayo!

249
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,150
I caught you.

250
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,271
Come in.

251
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,791
How's it going?

252
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,912
Great. I'm a bit out of it now.

253
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,196
Drunk, you mean.

254
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,000
Why are you in here?

255
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,356
Sofia was protecting me from
a female psychopath out there.

256
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,915
She seemed dangerous.

257
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,711
Yeah.

258
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,956
What about you?

259
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,034
I was drinking.
Women don't chase after me.

260
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,600
We're out of drink.

261
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,517
Here.

262
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,399
- Shit.
- I'll get some more.

263
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,474
For all of us.

264
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,231
Well...

265
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,718
I guess I'll be going.

266
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,831
But why?

267
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,430
I've drunk too much
and I don't feel well.

268
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,717
Don't be stupid,
it's just starting.

269
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,519
- For you, it is.
- Pelayo.

270
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,480
You can't go.
You're my guest of honor.

271
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,593
You're a son of a bitch, César.

272
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,476
- Why do you say that?
- The party's full of girls.

273
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,834
I go for a piss, you start
talking to her, and...

274
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,540
What?

275
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,591
Nothing. And I look like
an asshole.

276
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,514
Tell me what's wrong.

277
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,992
Why do you have
to chat up Sofía?

278
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,913
No one's chatting up Sofía.

279
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,833
Yeah, and I'm blind, right?

280
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,919
You're certainly drunk.

281
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,357
I'm drunk,
but I'll tell you this.

282
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,438
I like Sofía.
A hell of a lot.

283
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,757
She may even be
the girl of my dreams.

284
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,116
But if she fucks up our
friendship, she can go to hell.

285
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,670
I feel the same.

286
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,031
Sure.

287
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,838
Pelayo, where are you going?

288
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,560
- Home.
- Already?

289
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,275
Yeah, I'm wrecked.

290
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,551
- I'll come with you.
- Don't bother.

291
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,072
- You stay.
- Are you going too?

292
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,353
I have to get up early.

293
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,913
I can run you home later.

294
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,715
Stay on, I'm leaving you
in good hands.

295
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,640
What's wrong with him?

296
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,550
He's drunk.

297
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,597
- Is he annoyed with us?
- No.

298
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,951
You sure?

299
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,439
She doesn't look too happy.

300
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,078
Didn't you have to get up early?

301
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,911
I'm doing too much
for you tonight.

302
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,079
- Maybe it means something.
- Yeah, that you've got a nerve.

303
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,794
It's just for a minute.

304
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,595
Long enough for my friend
Nuria to admit defeat.

305
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,956
This is my place.

306
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,839
Don't dare laugh at it.

307
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,270
Why would I laugh?

308
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,040
It's nothing special,
but it's cheap.

309
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,151
- Do you like clowns?
- They're not clowns.

310
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,155
They're mime artists.

311
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,031
Pancho!

312
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,399
- I've got a cat.
- I hate cats.

313
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,916
They're almost as false
as actresses.

314
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,514
Says the caterer.

315
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,839
How do you pay for this?

316
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,274
Do your parents help?

317
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,190
Do you work?

318
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,437
He's real nosy,
isn't he, Pancho?

319
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,754
I'm an arms dealer.

320
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,596
Fancy that! I always wanted to
know how arms dealers lived.

321
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,150
Now you do.

322
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,077
How can I explain it to you?

323
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,116
You wouldn't understand.

324
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,760
Even I don't understand.

325
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,191
She was making coffee and
I started snooping around.

326
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,159
Suddenly, I got that stupid feeling
a lot of people get.

327
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,991
Well, I like it.

328
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,756
- What did you feel?
- That I loved her.

329
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,872
God, I'm even embarrassed
to say it.

330
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,316
I didn't hear you.

331
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,354
I said I like your place.

332
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,836
And I like yours.

333
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,631
Let's swap.

334
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,911
You wouldn't like it
tomorrow morning.

335
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,637
I said it because of the decor.

336
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,590
Your place is more...

337
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,071
More personal.

338
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,391
And warmer.

339
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,631
Warmer?

340
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,911
- Yes.
- You think my house is cold?

341
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,311
A bit.

342
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,000
- And am I?
- I don't know.

343
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,959
You said my house seemed cold.

344
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,873
If you're waiting for me
to list your virtues, hard luck.

345
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,280
You think you're real smart.

346
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,039
- Maybe.
- Well, you're wrong.

347
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,436
I don't need you
to list my virtues.

348
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,711
No, I'm sure you know
what they are.

349
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,198
But you'd like me
to see them too.

350
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,072
So you say.

351
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,113
I'm not going to argue about it.

352
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,391
Just as well.

353
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,190
You'd lose.

354
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,277
Oh, yeah?

355
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,474
But I don't want to argue either.
I propose we do the opposite.

356
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,631
We don't argue?

357
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,956
We show our defects.

358
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,511
Great!

359
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,359
I hope you're being fair.

360
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,359
This is absolutely you.

361
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,392
Well, mine is finished.

362
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,351
Fuck!

363
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,350
That's how you see me?

364
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,910
Did I go too far?

365
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,151
Sign it.

366
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,990
Let's see mine.

367
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,830
It's lovely!

368
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,000
It's not a caricature.

369
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,111
You see.

370
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,715
You draw beautifully.

371
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,274
- I'll sell it to you.
- Miser.

372
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,437
- How much?
- As it's you...

373
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,590
I'll settle for...

374
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,911
a kiss.

375
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,791
That smile is going to kill me!

376
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,909
It would be wrong
if we did anything tonight.

377
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,952
- Why?
- Pelayo. Remember?

378
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,276
Your best friend.

379
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,951
He doesn't have to find out.
Besides, he'd do the same.

380
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,470
I see friendship
really matters to you.

381
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,631
It does.

382
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,797
That's why I wouldn't tell him.

383
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,476
Some people...

384
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,311
say that they would be
happy with a normal life span.

385
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,919
But normal means different
things, depending on...

386
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,270
What are you looking at?

387
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,749
I'm watching TV.

388
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,518
The Romans, for instance,
lived only 25 years.

389
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,231
Today...

390
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,875
that figure has tripled,
which means that...

391
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,753
What the fuck is he on about?

392
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,350
I saw this before.

393
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,633
It's about cryonization.

394
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,431
Cryo... what?

395
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,797
When they freeze you
or something.

396
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,795
Like Walt Disney.

397
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,920
Wow, that's cold!

398
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,316
Hey, you!

399
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,433
There won't be a landslide.

400
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,515
It isn't dangerous, the ground
is firm here, and very solid.

401
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,550
Are you leaving?

402
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,519
Going home.
Here's my number.

403
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,319
But I'll call tomorrow.

404
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,111
What for?

405
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,119
All right, I won't call.

406
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,111
César.

407
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,591
What is it?

408
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,799
Come here.
I want to tell you a secret.

409
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,911
Come here.

410
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,631
Hello, darling.

411
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,954
Did you follow me?

412
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,071
Of course...

413
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,231
I didn't.

414
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,437
But I had the feeling we'd meet.

415
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,238
- How was the brunette?
- Great.

416
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:19,998
Why?

417
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,517
From your face, I'd say
you didn't sleep with her.

418
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,671
Let me guess.

419
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,276
You didn't sleep with her,
but you don't mind.

420
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,991
You have all the time
in the world for that.

421
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,476
And I bet you're
seeing her tomorrow.

422
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,114
- Brilliant.
- Aren't I?

423
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,231
There's more.

424
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,557
- Well?
- I scored at the party too.

425
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,758
But he wasn't up to it.
So I'm still hot for it.

426
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,714
- And?
- And until you meet up again...

427
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,480
with your Miss Universe,
you could have fun.

428
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,670
No, I think I prefer
to go home and sleep.

429
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,950
Come on, César.

430
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,634
It's your birthday.

431
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,115
- Skip it, I'm going home.
- What's up, César?

432
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,549
Are you scared?

433
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,995
Want some of this?

434
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,631
No, thanks.

435
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,798
Sure, act the innocent now.

436
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,317
I don't need that
to enjoy myself.

437
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,510
I can see that.

438
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,353
That's not a good idea.

439
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,236
Do what you want.

440
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,992
What's happiness for you?

441
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,191
- What?
- For me, this is happiness.

442
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,357
Being here with you.
What about you?

443
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,356
I can't handle heavy
conversations right now.

444
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,510
Your thoughts are
somewhere else, right?

445
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,871
Maybe.

446
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,233
One thing really bothers me.

447
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,991
- What?
- You know nothing about me.

448
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,190
Except my name's Nuria
and I'm a good fuck.

449
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,800
Two important things.

450
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,231
You don't know my address
or my number.

451
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,792
We have to start somewhere.
I'm going to see your house now.

452
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,996
It's not far.

453
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,309
Tell me something.

454
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,200
Do you believe in God?

455
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,795
- Hello.
- Hello.

456
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,956
- How are you?
- You got home all right?

457
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,153
Yeah. Well, I had
a horrible dream.

458
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,239
That you never saw me again.

459
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,200
Yes! I come out of your
house, go to my car...

460
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,960
and that crazy bitch
has been following me.

461
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,873
- Who, that Nuria?
- Yes.

462
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,118
She comes over and says,
want a lift?

463
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,880
She goes on so much
I don't know how to say no.

464
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,351
So I get in the car,
she drives faster and faster...

465
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,960
and kills herself.

466
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,958
- With me inside.
- That's horrible.

467
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,435
But the worst part...

468
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,200
is that my face
is completely destroyed...

469
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,591
like The Phantom of the Opera.

470
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,239
I couldn't wake up.

471
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,196
I was a monster.

472
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,832
You're a monster anyway.

473
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,710
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

474
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,320
I'm a monster too.

475
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,071
Look.

476
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,314
How was your house?

477
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,516
Was anyone left?

478
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,430
Left where?

479
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,551
In your house.

480
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,759
There was a party, remember?

481
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,951
A party?

482
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,074
Dreaming is shit.

483
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,080
That dream was nice.

484
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,318
A park, children playing,
a girl who loves you.

485
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,471
That's why.

486
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,311
Then you wake up
and you want to die.

487
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,274
At first, I didn't even have
the strength to react.

488
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,312
I'd been in a coma
for three weeks.

489
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,871
You were lucky.

490
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,397
You could have died, like Nuria.

491
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,511
What if I had?

492
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,753
It would've been better.

493
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,235
Did you see her body?

494
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,236
- I never did.
- You think she didn't die?

495
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,716
I'm like you.

496
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,279
I only believe what I see.

497
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,756
César, show me
your face, please.

498
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,720
- What for?
- Look.

499
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,349
It's true you had an accident.
It's true...

500
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,439
you were disfigured, but
not any more. Take that off.

501
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,829
The doctors fixed you.

502
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,078
They didn't have a fucking clue!

503
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,552
In the accident you didn't lose
just skin and some muscle.

504
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,595
The blow was so severe it caused
a multiple fracture of the skull.

505
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,600
We secured the osseous
structure with metal wires...

506
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,674
and, over that,
we reinserted the muscles...

507
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,672
we could still retrieve.

508
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,718
Yes, very nice,
but I know all that.

509
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,310
I've had it explained
to me 150 times.

510
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,512
But you never say
when you'll operate.

511
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,760
- I've been waiting two months.
- But we've operated three times.

512
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,634
I wouldn't call that
an operation. I'd call it...

513
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,111
Well...

514
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,439
I don't know what I'd call it.

515
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,998
The symmetry isn't perfect...

516
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,398
but what we've done with
your face is, if I may say so...

517
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,920
a craftsman's job.

518
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,436
We can't work on skin
which is pure scars.

519
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,671
No, no, there must be some way.

520
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,115
- What?
- What?

521
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,318
You're the doctors, aren't you?

522
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,353
A transplant, whatever!

523
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,519
There's a problem with fibrosis.
If we operate again...

524
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,757
we may just cause
further damage.

525
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,992
We'd need millimetric
precision...

526
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,312
and today,
that's impossible.

527
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,796
Let's look at this.
I'm not an idiot.

528
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,991
Today, people change
their breasts.

529
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,879
They have hair implants.

530
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,311
They even change
their skin color.

531
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,799
Are you saying that on the
threshold of the year 2000...

532
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,277
you can't do a simple operation
and sort out this...

533
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,756
...this fuck-up?

534
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,553
It isn't so simple, César.
Remember...

535
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,120
Don't patronize me!

536
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,113
Stop treating me like a child!

537
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,913
I'm not just any patient.

538
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,313
And this isn't
a welfare hospital.

539
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,992
I'm willing to pay any amount.

540
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,036
You're in charge.

541
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,391
They say you're the best
in your field.

542
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,076
Well, invent something,
experiment on me.

543
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,996
I've seen patients who've
lost all their features...

544
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,914
who can't even talk.

545
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,631
At least, you can look
yourself in the eye.

546
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,396
What good is that?

547
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,189
Every time I look in the mirror
I want to die.

548
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,960
Your case isn't so serious.

549
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,233
Just learn to accept it.

550
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,794
And who'll accept me?

551
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,838
Will you explain to the people
who look at me in the street?

552
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,114
Will you tell them
that looks aren't important?

553
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,039
That beauty is on the inside?

554
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,038
We'd like to show you something.

555
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,991
What is this?

556
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,874
A facial prosthesis.

557
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,673
We use it in extreme cases
of rejection, like yours.

558
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,869
This is shit!

559
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,753
It's not the best solution.

560
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,556
But it's all we can do
for the moment.

561
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,756
I want a face!

562
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,591
Not a mask!

563
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,960
We don't work miracles.

564
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,598
That's what the bastard said.

565
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,599
But in the end, they did.

566
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,991
Did what?

567
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,630
Work a miracle.

568
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,951
So it seems.

569
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,995
So it seems?
Things are or they aren't.

570
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,233
- Did they do it or not?
- I'm tired. Why don't you go?

571
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,956
I'll be back on Tuesday.
Want anything?

572
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,316
- No.
- All right.

573
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,796
See you on Tuesday.

574
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,156
A pad and a pencil.

575
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,280
But don't tell them. I don't
want to owe them anything.

576
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,754
Have I changed so much?

577
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,639
Because I recognize you.

578
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,591
How are you?

579
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,871
How are you?

580
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,439
You're playing a part now,
but I don't know what.

581
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,834
Your lips are smiling.

582
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,679
- But your eyes are trembling.
- What?

583
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,519
You're really very good.

584
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,036
As an actress.

585
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,156
I asked how you were.
You needn't answer.

586
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,271
I'm alive.

587
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,116
How should I be?

588
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,911
And I'm tired.

589
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,632
Tired of waiting
for you to call...

590
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,678
even to say, tough luck.

591
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,751
I was busy.

592
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,871
Bullshit!

593
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,800
I was afraid you'd feel
uncomfortable if I rang.

594
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,436
You were afraid
you'd feel uncomfortable.

595
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,396
Afraid you couldn't
look me in the face.

596
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:28,792
Like now.

597
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,075
That's not true.

598
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,111
I've often dreamed
of this moment.

599
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,630
What moment?

600
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,352
The moment we'd meet again.

601
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,277
In my dream we were
just like this.

602
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,111
Here...

603
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,431
in the park.

604
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,511
Although...

605
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,434
something was different.

606
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,471
What?

607
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,673
It wasn't raining.

608
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,750
I have to go, César.

609
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,873
What are you doing
tomorrow night?

610
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,118
- Studying. I'm very busy.
- It's Friday, we could meet.

611
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,674
I've got a lot to do.

612
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,836
All right, so long.

613
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,791
César!

614
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,640
We'll meet if you want.

615
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,190
If you want.

616
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,719
As soon as there is the
slightest possibility of death...

617
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,554
the stabilization and transport
team goes into action.

618
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,075
Once the client is declared
legally dead...

619
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,516
he is put into
a maintenance capsule...

620
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,599
and the transport legalities
are sorted out.

621
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,396
In the storeroom in Arizona,
in the U.S.A...

622
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,116
a team of specialists prepare
the body for final freezing.

623
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,590
Among other measures...

624
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,840
blood is replaced by a solution
which conserves the organs.

625
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:23,957
Finally...

626
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,197
the client is put
in the capsule...

627
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,313
where he will remain until
medicine can reanimate him.

628
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,271
To be honest,
I'd have to think it over.

629
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,711
It's hard to accept the idea.

630
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,718
How should we view it?

631
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,675
We are, undoubtedly...

632
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,111
facing a major development...

633
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,676
a new challenge
for humanity.

634
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,877
It's understandable that
the first reaction is rejection.

635
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,397
We have now got
the means to do it.

636
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,439
We've got the technology.

637
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,230
But, above all...

638
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,637
we have sufficient
moral maturity...

639
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,474
to understand what
this new step means...

640
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,360
for human evolution,
to look at the future...

641
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,479
and put an end to certain
meaningless taboos...

642
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,990
inherited from
ancient religions...

643
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,317
old and useless memories.

644
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,952
Thank you for speaking to us.

645
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,998
And thank you to our audience...

646
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,150
- Hi.
- Hi.

647
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,471
What's that?

648
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,515
Shit, isn't it?

649
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,674
But they suggested I wear it,
in case of infection.

650
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,711
Well, kid.

651
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,676
What're you up to?

652
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,317
Arguing with doctors all day.

653
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,358
- You should go out more.
- I'm trying.

654
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,437
What're you having?

655
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,677
- Rum and coke, you want one?
- Yes.

656
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,030
I'll get you one.

657
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,313
I'm going to the bathroom.

658
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,636
Take that off.

659
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,237
Why?

660
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,518
Don't you realize you won't
be able to hide your face?

661
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,357
I told you,
it's to stop infections.

662
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,871
Sure.

663
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,791
If you're embarrassed, just go.
Nobody asked you to come.

664
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,911
Sofia did.

665
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:29,877
What?

666
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,879
She didn't want to be alone
with you.

667
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:33,957
Why not?

668
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,038
You're giving her a hard time.

669
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,390
I'm having a hard time.

670
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,393
Talk to a psychologist,
or to me.

671
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,069
Don't take it out on a girl
you met once.

672
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,555
Did she say that?

673
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,270
Did she say that?

674
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,431
Bitch!

675
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,591
Come back!

676
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,079
Whisky and coke.

677
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,316
What whisky?

678
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,271
What did you say?

679
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,430
What whisky?

680
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,556
Why don't you ask me
to my face, son of a bitch?

681
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,276
Ballantine's.

682
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:39,996
Same again.

683
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,913
No, this one's on me.

684
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,751
Why?

685
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,230
Just is.

686
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,473
Fix your face, man!

687
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,115
- Hello.
- Hello.

688
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,556
Where were you?

689
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,031
Around.

690
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,113
Pelayo went to look for you.

691
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,433
And I came to look for you.

692
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,631
Why?

693
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,111
To...

694
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,351
No reason.

695
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,431
To...

696
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,196
buy you a drink.

697
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,872
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks.

698
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,757
Can you tell I'm elbowing in?

699
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,351
The thing is...

700
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,835
I've got a problem.

701
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,834
A girl's chasing me...

702
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,073
and I need some help
to get rid of her.

703
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,114
Shit, shit, shit,
she's coming this way.

704
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,476
She's coming this way.

705
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,633
Don't look, don't look.

706
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,554
You carry on talking,
act as if he weren't here.

707
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,399
I mean, as if I were here.

708
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,671
Keep talking,
tra-la-lee, tra-la-la.

709
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,873
What a lovely conversation
we're having.

710
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,518
So that's it, here we are.

711
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,635
Having a bit of a chat
about life.

712
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:13,910
That's enough!

713
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,119
Where the hell were you?

714
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,117
Around.

715
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,993
I'm leaving, I'm tired.

716
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,113
You two stay if you want.

717
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,871
Well, this is where I leave you.

718
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,715
- I'll see you home.
- No, I live very close.

719
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,633
- I've got the motor bike.
- No.

720
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,956
Don't be silly!

721
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,834
Lay off, Pelayo.
She wants to go on her own.

722
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,914
Shut up, you're drunk.

723
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,551
I might be drunk,
but I'm not an idiot.

724
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,353
- Anyway, I'm not drunk.
- Really, you needn't bother.

725
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,551
As you wish.

726
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,360
You're the one who's drunk.

727
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,236
We'll call you to meet
some other day.

728
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,677
All right, we could go
to the movies.

729
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,069
- You hear?
- Great!

730
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,199
Well, that's it then.

731
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,350
No, don't kiss me.

732
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,314
You might get poisoned
by my drunken breath.

733
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,591
Well...

734
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,000
We'll meet up soon.

735
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,351
Sure.

736
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,155
We'll meet up soon.

737
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,830
It's not cold.

738
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,831
Well...

739
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,517
I'm gonna have to go.

740
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,235
Where are you going?

741
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,520
I've just remembered
my bike is back here.

742
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,915
I'll go with you.

743
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:08,191
No, why?
You're almost home now.

744
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,272
- See you tomorrow.
- Pelayo.

745
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,556
Wait a minute.

746
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,391
What?

747
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,071
I don't know.

748
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,712
You drank too much.
We'll talk tomorrow if you want.

749
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,718
Tomorrow, I'll wish I were dead.

750
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,671
You won't.

751
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,599
You just need to rest.

752
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:33,831
Pelayo!

753
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,199
You're my best friend.

754
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,470
Son of a bitch!

755
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,836
Open your eyes.

756
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,357
César.

757
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,590
It's me.

758
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:47,712
Sofía!

759
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,871
- What are you doing here?
- Forgive me.

760
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,277
Why?

761
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,511
I love you.

762
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,438
Come on.

763
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,910
What's wrong?

764
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,471
Nothing.

765
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:29,033
I still can't believe
this is really happening.

766
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,955
Where's Pelayo?

767
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,590
I don't know. He went
with you, didn't he?

768
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:36,957
Yes.

769
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:38,991
Of course.

770
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,791
Come on.

771
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,233
God, what a sensation!

772
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,631
Of what?

773
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,640
Do you ever feel you've
lived something before?

774
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,671
Yes.

775
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,716
Why is that?

776
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,833
They say it's a lapse
in the brain.

777
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,680
I've been here before.

778
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,749
It usually goes away
after a few seconds.

779
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,439
I don't want it to go away.

780
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,912
You've made use of your time.

781
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,760
That's all there is here.

782
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,671
Very pretty.

783
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,031
Is it Sofía?

784
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,112
How much longer will I be here?

785
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,234
No one ever knows that.

786
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,840
Even my worst nightmare
was never like this place.

787
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,594
It's a psychiatric penitentiary.
No more, no less.

788
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,915
I shouldn't be here.

789
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,793
You're accused of murder.

790
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,599
I don't even know what I did.

791
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,711
Tell me something.

792
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,197
Does the name Eli
mean anything to you?

793
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,831
Eli...

794
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,033
You know a girl with that name?

795
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,231
No.

796
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:39,796
Why do you ask?

797
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,680
It seems you kept
repeating it last night.

798
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,200
I guess I was dreaming.

799
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,716
What did you dream?

800
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,553
I can't remember.

801
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,200
It could be important.

802
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,913
How could it be important?

803
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,393
Look, I can prove you didn't
know what you were doing...

804
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,877
but first I have to find
some explanation for all this.

805
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,959
There is no explanation.
I told you the other day.

806
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,720
What did you dream, César?

807
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,156
I don't know.

808
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,760
I only remember bits.

809
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,792
First, I'm in a kind of office.

810
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,271
A secretary shows me
into another office.

811
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:24,074
There, there's a photo
of a sunset and a man.

812
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:25,991
Then...

813
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,430
I don't know.

814
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,480
- They show me lots of papers.
- What papers?

815
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:31,871
I don't know.

816
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,475
But I sign them.

817
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,676
Does the office belong
to your company?

818
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,671
No, I don't recognise it.

819
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,952
You dreamed of a place
you'd never been?

820
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:46,314
Yes. That happens a lot,
doesn't it?

821
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,516
Are these the papers...

822
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,713
you signed with the doctors?

823
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,433
No, what happened with
the doctors was surreal.

824
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,359
- Why?
- One day they rang me...

825
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,960
to go to the hospital.

826
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,192
When I arrived, the whole
surgical team was waiting.

827
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,271
For months...

828
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,240
those faces had looked
at me with indifference...

829
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,510
and impotence.

830
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,273
Now they were all smiles.

831
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,474
The same bastard who had
said my case was hopeless...

832
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,990
started talking about
some operation.

833
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,398
They had a new revolutionary
system in the clinic now.

834
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,038
They said that
within two weeks...

835
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,874
my face would be
completely reconstructed.

836
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,190
You didn't believe them?

837
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,510
No, not at first.

838
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:30,073
I thought it was just a way
to get more money out of me.

839
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,798
But they showed me all
the gadgets for the operation.

840
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,557
It looked like science fiction.

841
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,797
All I could see were cables,
switches, monitors.

842
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,919
Actually, I never really knew
what they were going to do.

843
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,392
But I thought
I'd nothing to lose.

844
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,195
Those people were
used to rhinoplasties...

845
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,357
liposuctions,
hair transplants...

846
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,552
but my operation
was much more.

847
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,760
In less than a week...

848
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,838
my life had turned around.

849
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,400
One night, I was lying
on the ground, drunk...

850
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,829
wanting to die.

851
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,510
The next morning, my dreams
were coming true...

852
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,154
like in the movies.

853
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,793
Sofía loved me, and the doctors
found the miracle cure.

854
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,600
I don't know.
Obviously, I was suspicious.

855
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,436
Suspicious?

856
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,919
Of whom? Of what?

857
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,391
I don't know.

858
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,239
In life, you never know.

859
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,750
Happiness comes
when you least expect it.

860
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,155
I once knew a guy
who was alone in the world.

861
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,829
Suddenly, he was
married with two daughters.

862
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,433
Fuck, you've got a strange
idea of happiness.

863
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,356
Well, that depends
on the individual.

864
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,035
What's happiness for you?

865
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,953
What's happiness for you?

866
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,311
Don't ask any more stupid
questions.

867
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,593
But at that time you were happy.
Or weren't you?

868
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,475
So what?
My life now is shit.

869
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,151
All I can do is eat,
shit, sleep...

870
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,919
and dream of my memories.

871
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,039
It's good that you remember.

872
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:28,871
Well?

873
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,031
Well, what?

874
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,996
They were to remove
the plates today.

875
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,436
And they did.

876
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:38,591
And?

877
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,234
Well, my ears are
where they should be.

878
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,079
César, don't scare me.

879
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,320
Take off the plates.

880
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,231
You do it.

881
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,994
How did they do it?

882
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,711
Wait.

883
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,116
Just to say...

884
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,436
that I love you.

885
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:50,840
You're going too fast...

886
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,431
considering
we met yesterday.

887
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,471
Yesterday?

888
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,952
My birthday, don't you remember?

889
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,034
I met an incredible girl.

890
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:03,876
Her name was Sofía.

891
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,476
But today I woke up
feeling great...

892
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,637
and now I'm with
the girl again.

893
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:16,591
What is it?

894
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:20,551
What is it?

895
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,353
If you want me to move,
you have to put in a coin.

896
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,751
Ting!

897
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,031
We never appreciate the good
moments till they're over.

898
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,471
Maybe that's why
they're good moments.

899
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,439
We don't stop to think
about them.

900
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:47,871
Perhaps.

901
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,918
What happened to Pelayo?

902
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:52,112
- What's up?
- Hang on a minute.

903
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:55,233
- That's it.
- About time.

904
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,990
- Want anything else?
- No, thanks.

905
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,115
How's things, Pelayo?

906
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,751
Fine.

907
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,195
How's things, Pelayo?

908
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,591
Fine.

909
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,511
Yeah.

910
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,351
I'm actually not as fucked up
as I look.

911
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,235
I'm used to you always
winning, you bastard.

912
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,840
And Sofía isn't that great.

913
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,190
You said she was ideal.

914
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,311
Really?

915
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,191
I was drunk.

916
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,114
Anyway, we're friends.

917
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:40,871
Bastard!

918
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,399
What's that on your face?

919
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,591
What?

920
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,397
Fuck, there's a seam opening!

921
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,750
What are you on about?

922
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:58,994
You fucking idiot!

923
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,075
What's the matter?

924
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:02,630
I hate dreaming.

925
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,152
You're tickling me.

926
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,677
What's wrong?

927
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:26,792
What is it?

928
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,272
- Where's Sofía?
- What?

929
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,273
What have you done with Sofía?

930
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,918
- I am Sofía.
- You bitch!

931
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,391
You're mad.

932
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,598
- You're mad.
- Where is she?

933
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,195
In one minute,
I'm going to call the police.

934
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,710
You'll be in trouble
if Sofía doesn't appear.

935
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,037
So you survived the accident.

936
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,920
What accident?

937
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,349
Whose body was it?

938
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,392
- I didn't have an accident.
- No.

939
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,672
It wasn't an accident.
It was attempted murder.

940
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,156
A pity you didn't see
my face, bitch!

941
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,750
Why are you doing this?
How have I changed?

942
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:29,871
You haven't.

943
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,800
You're the same lunatic
who gatecrashed my party.

944
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,713
I'm the girl you made love to
just now. I'm Sofía.

945
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,870
Stop saying you're Sofía,
do you hear?

946
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:41,550
Don't say her name!

947
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,193
You won't tell me where she is.

948
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:49,751
You never will.

949
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:55,671
César...

950
01:08:58,600 --> 01:08:59,511
I love you.

951
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,473
- Hello.
- Hello.

952
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,952
You can go, I'll see to this.

953
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:15,671
Right.

954
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,999
Let me get this clear.

955
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:21,955
Where were you last night?

956
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,957
At home.
I told that gentleman.

957
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,640
At home. With whom?

958
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,031
With a girl.

959
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,959
The girl I just questioned?

960
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:32,629
No, that's another girl.
I was with Sofía.

961
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,519
The girl I spoke to was Sofía.

962
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,871
Yes, that's what she says,
but it's a lie.

963
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,116
Who is she then?

964
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,397
- She's Nuria.
- Nuria?

965
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:41,871
Nuria what?

966
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,711
I don't know. She never
told me her surname.

967
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:48,191
Let's see.

968
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:52,836
You were at home with a girl
called Sofía, and suddenly...

969
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,635
I go to the bathroom, come back,
and she's in Sofía's place.

970
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:56,956
Where's Sofía?

971
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,873
Ask Nuria, she's pretending
to be her.

972
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,160
You don't know her surname?

973
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,397
But who do you believe,
her or me?

974
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,200
Listen, that girl's papers
are all in order.

975
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,550
We've let her go.

976
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:11,916
You've what?

977
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,391
And I assure you
she's called Sofía.

978
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:18,357
Sofía Cueto, and she lives
at number 2, Quirós St.

979
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,437
No!

980
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,591
No, what?

981
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,031
Well, yes, but that's
another girl.

982
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:24,799
I know the real Sofía.

983
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,072
Then tell me where she is.

984
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,155
Because, legally...

985
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,398
the girl
you're talking about...

986
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,751
only exists
in your imagination.

987
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,836
- I don't believe this.
- And another thing...

988
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:43,230
the girl looks
as if she'd been hit.

989
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,352
She was in my house,
supplanting my girlfriend!

990
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:46,914
I don't know why...

991
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,436
but she wouldn't
press charges.

992
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:53,040
Fucking great!
So now she's the victim!

993
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,151
Tell me.

994
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:55,557
Are you on drugs?

995
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:56,995
- God!
- We do know...

996
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,078
you were under
psychiatric care.

997
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,920
My face was destroyed
in a car crash she caused!

998
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,634
Your face looks fine.

999
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:04,791
Because...

1000
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:08,153
it doesn't matter. I've
got nothing more to say.

1001
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,271
Young man...

1002
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,391
I'd advise you to see
a psychiatrist.

1003
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,829
Are you an idiot?

1004
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,360
What the fuck is this?

1005
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,512
- What do you mean?
- If you wanted...

1006
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:28,394
to fuck her up,
there are other ways to do it!

1007
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,155
Keep away from Sofía!

1008
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,589
It isn't Sofía, it's Nuria!

1009
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,711
Nuria's dead!

1010
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,032
Calm down, or you'll be
sleeping in a cell tonight!

1011
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,351
Don't ever talk to me again!

1012
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,559
I don't know what the cops
told you, but Nuria is alive!

1013
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,791
The cops didn't tell me,
Sofía did.

1014
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,515
Listen, you spoke to her
by phone, didn't you?

1015
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,473
- Let go!
- It wasn't Sofía.

1016
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,798
Nuria can imitate her voice,
she took her ID, her apartment.

1017
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,799
It wasn't over the phone.
I've just dropped her home.

1018
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,229
She looked like this.

1019
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:06,955
Nice photo, isn't it?

1020
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,593
You going to say
that isn't Sofía?

1021
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:10,711
But that's...

1022
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,680
Is this a joke or what?

1023
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,555
You're crazy, man.

1024
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:16,630
I'm crazy?

1025
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,320
I'm crazy?

1026
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:23,034
You're the ones who are mad!
You're all mad!

1027
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,151
Let go of me!

1028
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,154
God, what's happening?

1029
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,754
It's my partners, right?

1030
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,232
They've paid you,
this is a plot!

1031
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:37,036
Look at yourself. You haven't
been right since the accident.

1032
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:39,680
Fuck you!

1033
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,156
Are you saying...

1034
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:47,030
Are you saying this is the girl
you ran after the other night?

1035
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:49,632
- Is this your ideal girl?
- Yes!

1036
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,475
And you took her.

1037
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,679
You need a psychiatrist!

1038
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,031
Problems?

1039
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,673
I'm in no mood, so just...

1040
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,917
There's an explanation
for all this.

1041
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:18,551
César.

1042
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,231
Who are you?

1043
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,750
- You've seen me on TV.
- What do you want?

1044
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,080
I'm here to help you.

1045
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:33,198
First of all, it's very important
that you calm down.

1046
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,235
- Calm down?
- You must overcome your fears...

1047
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,234
and regain control.

1048
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,151
What control do you mean?
I'm fine.

1049
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,874
Who says you aren't?

1050
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,674
They do. All of them.

1051
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:46,750
They say I'm mad.

1052
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,632
No, of course you're not mad.

1053
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:51,714
But what if I told you...

1054
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,152
you were dreaming?

1055
01:13:58,640 --> 01:13:59,960
No, no, no...

1056
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,879
- Why not?
- Look...

1057
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,237
I know what's real,
and this is real.

1058
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,351
How do you know?

1059
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,917
You discover your dreams
when you wake.

1060
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,031
I just know.

1061
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,711
My dreams are much simpler
than all this.

1062
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:13,274
No dream is simple.

1063
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,109
Look at those people.

1064
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:18,675
They seem to be talking about
their own business.

1065
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,877
Completely unaware of you.

1066
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,309
And yet, they could be there
because you...

1067
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,273
wanted it.
What's more...

1068
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,032
you could have them
at your complete service...

1069
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,233
or have them destroy you.

1070
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,353
I want them to be quiet.

1071
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:35,556
And you too.

1072
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,150
See?

1073
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,520
What's going on here?

1074
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,791
Someone tell me
the fucking truth!

1075
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:10,911
The truth?

1076
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,719
Maybe you couldn't take it.

1077
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,920
It had to be a set-up,
a big joke to drive me crazy.

1078
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:23,192
They all knew. Nuria, Pelayo,
the police, the guy at the bar.

1079
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,073
- Who was he?
- I don't know.

1080
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,795
You said you saw him on TV.
On what program?

1081
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:28,911
I don't know!

1082
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,192
I don't know.

1083
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,596
One that talked about
freezing the dead.

1084
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,309
- Freezing the dead?
- Cryonization.

1085
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,159
Like they did to Walt Disney.

1086
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,118
Maybe I can help you remember.

1087
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,355
Is that a threat?

1088
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:52,591
Lie down.

1089
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,270
What's that?

1090
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:00,916
A syringe.

1091
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,197
Relax.

1092
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:07,316
My arm's stinging.

1093
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,080
It's a tranquillizer.

1094
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:10,791
What for?

1095
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,191
These things are all bullshit.

1096
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,676
If you'd trusted
psychiatrists more...

1097
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,473
you mightn't be here now.

1098
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:29,756
That finger...

1099
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:33,878
- It's making me nervous.
- You needn't be afraid.

1100
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,915
- I'm not afraid.
- Stop talking and concentrate.

1101
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,151
Come on.

1102
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,191
Fuck...

1103
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,271
I feel dizzy.

1104
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:44,870
Good-bye, César.

1105
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,797
Very good. Now let's see if you
can tell me about that dream.

1106
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:54,635
Dream...

1107
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:58,397
- In my dream, it isn't raining.
- The office dream.

1108
01:16:58,760 --> 01:16:59,557
Eli...

1109
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,151
That's it. I want you
to tell me who Eli is.

1110
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,591
- A secretary.
- Eli is a secretary?

1111
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,156
She tells me to go in.
They're expecting me.

1112
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,635
Who's expecting you?

1113
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:13,080
- The Frenchman from the TV.
- Sit down, please.

1114
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:14,795
It's a contract.

1115
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,840
- Eli...
- César, who is Eli?

1116
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,160
You won't regret it.

1117
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:22,357
Sign.

1118
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,280
- What are you signing?
- Eli will see to everything.

1119
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:27,669
What have you signed?

1120
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,391
What's wrong?

1121
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,309
What's wrong, César?

1122
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:38,994
- Why are you crying?
- I'm going to die.

1123
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,554
You're not going to die.

1124
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,797
- I don't know how many.
- How many what?

1125
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,997
- Pills.
- You took pills?

1126
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:51,153
- How many should I take?
- Pills to feel better?

1127
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:52,750
I don't want to.

1128
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,633
When I count to three,
you'll wake up.

1129
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,115
One... two...

1130
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,600
I thought that, up to now,
you'd told me the truth.

1131
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:06,750
What do you mean?

1132
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,999
You said you took nothing.

1133
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,471
César, I'll ask you
for the last time.

1134
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,714
- Did you take drugs?
- Fuck! Why does everyone...

1135
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,877
Stop play-acting.
Tell me the truth!

1136
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,999
- I must know what you took.
- I didn't take anything!

1137
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,111
Don't you see?

1138
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:25,199
Your brain could have been
affected by the pills.

1139
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,357
- I didn't take any!
- You said you did!

1140
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,194
It's just a dream!

1141
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,631
Why make it more important
than it is?

1142
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,196
Can't you tell dreams
from reality? I can!

1143
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,471
Really? Don't make me laugh!

1144
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:41,239
Bodies that come to life,
people who disappear.

1145
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,113
You, the Phantom
of the Opera!

1146
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,600
Tell me one thing.

1147
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,792
Do you remember
what you did to Sofía?

1148
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:55,151
It wasn't Sofía.

1149
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,919
I don't care who it was.

1150
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,875
What did you do to her?

1151
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,191
You remember?

1152
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:35,831
My God!

1153
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,674
What are you doing?
I thought you were a burglar.

1154
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,430
Who are you?

1155
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:48,631
I'm Sofía.

1156
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:50,390
Sofía...

1157
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,240
You're not Sofía.

1158
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:02,351
César, this will
all be over soon.

1159
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,874
We'll be together again.

1160
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:08,395
You'll forget Nuria
and I won't be afraid of you.

1161
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,431
- I'm thirsty.
- I'll get some water.

1162
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:55,431
Sofía!

1163
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,238
Yes, César, I'm Sofía.

1164
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:04,676
I'm Sofía.

1165
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,030
I want to see you.

1166
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,790
I want to see you.
I want to see you!

1167
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:46,915
I want to see you!

1168
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,556
At times you dream
you're with someone.

1169
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,673
For example, your father.

1170
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,956
In seconds, he becomes
your mother...

1171
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,915
and then, the news vendor
on the corner.

1172
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:41,318
Yet you still feel as if you're
talking to the same person.

1173
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,476
You thought you were
at home, but suddenly...

1174
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:47,637
you realize
you're in a school...

1175
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:49,236
or a hospital...

1176
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:51,356
or a prison.

1177
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,360
Dreams are like that.

1178
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:58,113
And at times the mind behaves
as if it were in a dream.

1179
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:01,075
- You know what derangement is?
- For fuck's sake!

1180
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,915
Say I'm stupid if you want,
but this isn't derangement!

1181
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:05,716
Then what is it?

1182
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,598
You tell me,
because I don't know.

1183
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,398
I don't know what's in here...

1184
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,040
or why you killed
your girlfriend.

1185
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:16,034
I don't know who Eli is,
or that man from the TV.

1186
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:17,230
I don't know anything.

1187
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,315
That makes two of us.

1188
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,672
Will you still come
after the trial?

1189
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:34,759
Don't you hate the sight of me?

1190
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:38,556
What will you plead?

1191
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,035
Why do you ask that?

1192
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,318
The first hearing is next week.

1193
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,519
Temporary derangement.

1194
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:51,552
It's your best chance.

1195
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:54,318
Even so, it won't be much use.

1196
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,193
They won't believe me.

1197
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,679
Even I don't believe it.

1198
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:00,115
What do you believe?

1199
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,033
I think you're very sick...

1200
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,716
and should stay here
for a long time.

1201
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,880
Don't worry. I'll get
at least twenty years.

1202
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,920
César, you may not believe it,
but I care about you.

1203
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:14,840
I care a lot about you.

1204
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:18,231
Look, kid.

1205
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,234
Your case interests me.

1206
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,433
I'm sorry about what's happened.

1207
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:25,798
I even thought someone was
playing tricks on you, but...

1208
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,231
I can't and must not
exceed my duties.

1209
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:31,234
- I'm just a psychiatrist.
- You don't look like one.

1210
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,797
- What do I look like?
- My father.

1211
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:35,800
Preaching at me all day.

1212
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,195
Your father's dead.

1213
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:39,471
There you go.

1214
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:48,831
By the way...

1215
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:52,033
What happened to that man with
the wife and two daughters?

1216
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,478
I don't know,
I never saw him again.

1217
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,833
Take my advice, get a lawyer.

1218
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,230
Good-bye, César.

1219
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,111
Good-bye.

1220
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:10,590
The main Spanish investment,
but certainly the most novel.

1221
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,636
Its economic presence
in Cuba.

1222
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,513
Depending on the era.

1223
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,837
In the Roman Empire,
for example...

1224
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:34,997
the normal thing
was to live...

1225
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:36,190
only 25 years.

1226
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:45,193
Who's got the remote?

1227
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:48,756
Give it to me!

1228
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:56,794
Get it off him!

1229
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:13,671
What's up?

1230
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,916
There's a computer here
connected to Internet.

1231
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,555
They'll only let me use it
if you come with me.

1232
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,714
- Why do you want Internet?
- I know what Eli is.

1233
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:24,351
Wait!

1234
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:27,076
Eli isn't a person,
it's a company.

1235
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,192
- How do you know?
- It isn't Eli.

1236
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:32,359
It's L.E. They're the initials
of an American company.

1237
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,952
- What are you doing?
- Checking the initials program.

1238
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:38,311
It'll tell us all it knows
about L.E.

1239
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:44,591
Shit!

1240
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:45,797
It'll take ages.

1241
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:46,911
No, wait.

1242
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:54,351
Fuck!

1243
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,231
I feel like
I've done this before.

1244
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,749
A cerebral dysfunction.

1245
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,236
- A lapse in the brain.
- No, not this time.

1246
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,471
My God!

1247
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,116
- That's it.
- The photo in your dream?

1248
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:09,119
I had to see it before I could
dream about it, right?

1249
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:10,390
Cryonics.

1250
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:12,432
- Cryonization.
- I'll print this.

1251
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:13,596
Wait a minute.

1252
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,520
I don't see what this
has to do with your case.

1253
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:17,870
The key is in here.

1254
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:19,838
Look, there's an office
in Madrid.

1255
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:22,192
I'll go and check it out.

1256
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:22,900
No!

1257
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,476
I have to go too.

1258
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:28,231
- I can't get you out of here.
- I'd be let out under supervision.

1259
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:29,954
Make up some excuse.

1260
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,674
- It isn't easy.
- You can do it.

1261
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,271
You know something else,
don't you?

1262
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:38,120
I don't know anything.

1263
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,677
- I've just got a feeling.
- What is it?

1264
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:41,911
I have to go there.

1265
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:43,390
One way or another.

1266
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:28,353
Let's get things straight.

1267
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,119
We're outside, I'm armed.

1268
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,676
My job is to stop you
doing anything stupid.

1269
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,951
Try anything,
and you get a bullet.

1270
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:09,114
I've been here before.

1271
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:11,354
- This way.
- Move.

1272
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:28,074
You've got 20 minutes.

1273
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:40,240
It's just like in my dream.

1274
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:46,752
Good morning, can I help you?

1275
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:51,317
Well, actually, we wanted
to speak to Mr. Duvernois.

1276
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:54,671
He's my son.

1277
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:58,635
He's very shy.

1278
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:03,351
Mr. Duvernois isn't here
right now.

1279
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,514
But, first of all, do you know
what cryonization is?

1280
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:08,320
Well, more or less.

1281
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:12,396
Here are some leaflets. You can
read them while you're waiting.

1282
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,831
One of my colleagues
will be with you soon.

1283
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:16,311
Thank you.

1284
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,872
Live without limits.
Tomorrow is for the farsighted.

1285
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:22,272
What is this?
Some kind of sect?

1286
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,358
Cryonization is
the bio-stasis...

1287
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:26,517
or preservation
of human beings.

1288
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:29,834
It is the bridge to carry
our patients to a future...

1289
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,435
when technology will
restore them to life.

1290
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,193
You pay to live eternally.

1291
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,159
They laughed at Jules Verne.

1292
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:44,271
César...

1293
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:46,757
All this is absolutely
impossible.

1294
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,713
What do you know of the future?

1295
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:51,799
They promise what the Church
has always promised.

1296
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,674
Immortality. Except they're
quacks, not priests.

1297
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:55,996
How are you involved?

1298
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:59,075
You're not cryonized.
You're alive.

1299
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:02,114
This is the contract,
if you want to look at it.

1300
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:06,358
The procedure is very simple.
You could die at any time.

1301
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:09,115
Today, tomorrow, in 20 years,
it doesn't matter to us.

1302
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:12,677
At the very moment you're
declared legally dead...

1303
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:16,516
Life Extension transfers your
body to our store in Arizona.

1304
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:18,956
There, it's frozen
at minus 78 degrees.

1305
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:22,710
We call that total suspension,
and it costs 240,000 dollars.

1306
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:26,038
30,000 pays for the freezing
process, and the rest...

1307
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:27,959
goes into
an investment fund...

1308
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:30,834
the interests from which
pay for maintenance...

1309
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,839
and resurrection costs,
the day that it's possible.

1310
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:35,560
If it is possible.

1311
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:39,755
We believe that the reanimation
of the dead will be possible.

1312
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:41,599
- What's this?
- What?

1313
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:42,836
Clause 14.

1314
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:45,236
- Artificial perception.
- It's a concept...

1315
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:47,750
that we haven't
fully developed yet.

1316
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:49,351
Look.

1317
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:50,870
This is a life.

1318
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:53,119
Birth and death.

1319
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:56,155
Let's say you've got
a terminal illness.

1320
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:59,832
Of course, you want to go on
living, but not in the future.

1321
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:03,872
That doesn't interest you.
You want to live your life now.

1322
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:04,991
Very well.

1323
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:07,033
You die, we freeze you...

1324
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:09,391
and when we can
resuscitate you...

1325
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:10,960
we'll have you live...

1326
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:13,631
a dream.

1327
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:15,991
A dream?

1328
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:17,600
It will all look real.

1329
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:19,837
Your family and friends,
your city...

1330
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:23,670
the world, even this office,
but it'll be a virtual reality.

1331
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:26,919
What's more, we'll make you
forget that you've died...

1332
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:29,271
and that you signed
this contract.

1333
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:30,630
- How?
- Very simple.

1334
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:32,959
Wiping it from your memory.

1335
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:35,880
You'll live your life linearly,
as if nothing had happened.

1336
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:39,597
And best of all, you'll live it
as you like, as you wish.

1337
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:42,078
You'll decide at all times.

1338
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:43,071
But...

1339
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,233
What if there were mistakes?

1340
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:49,033
What if the dream was
transformed into a nightmare?

1341
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:52,438
Well, the subconscious
can always play a dirty trick.

1342
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:55,872
But we're not cowboys,
this is a serious company.

1343
01:35:56,080 --> 01:36:00,199
And virtual reality technology is
constantly making huge advances.

1344
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:01,551
Look.

1345
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:03,476
I'll be honest.

1346
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:07,994
Signing Clause 14 is
like signing for paradise.

1347
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:10,320
It's hard to believe.

1348
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:13,472
But they laughed at Jules Verne.

1349
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:19,991
Excuse me.

1350
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,634
- Where are you going so fast?
- To the bathroom.

1351
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,036
- Well, not so fast.
- I'll go with him.

1352
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:32,158
He just felt ill, don't worry.

1353
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:40,159
César, calm down, please.

1354
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:42,716
This is a dream.
It's the only explanation.

1355
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:44,673
What he said is impossible.

1356
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:47,076
In the 20th century,
but maybe not in the 30th!

1357
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:50,159
- Maybe not, but we're in 1997.
- That's what it seems.

1358
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,630
- I paid for it to seem like that.
- Listen!

1359
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:54,320
If this is a dream...
Look at me!

1360
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:57,274
If this is a dream, it means
that I don't exist!

1361
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:58,470
I just imagine you.

1362
01:36:58,680 --> 01:36:59,511
No!

1363
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:02,600
- César, I'm real.
- How do I know that?

1364
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:05,277
Can't you tell a dream
from reality?

1365
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:07,040
Is this a dream, eh?

1366
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:08,594
Tell me, is this a dream?

1367
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:14,349
César, I'm wearing myself out
over this case.

1368
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:17,911
There is no case, I didn't kill
anyone, it's all a nightmare!

1369
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:19,833
Fuck it, César, trust me!

1370
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:21,440
This isn't a dream.

1371
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:22,630
They got it wrong.

1372
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:24,160
- Who?
- I don't know!

1373
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:26,557
But they mixed up
Sofía and Nuria!

1374
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:28,080
I see a face that isn't mine!

1375
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:30,875
I'm sick of hearing that!
Your face is fine.

1376
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:34,318
You're behaving like a child,
hiding behind that mask.

1377
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:37,234
- Go on, take it off!
- I don't want to see myself!

1378
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:39,710
I don't care about that.
I want to see you.

1379
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,674
Don't you realize?
All that matters is what I see!

1380
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:43,791
It's my dream!

1381
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,150
Say that once more...

1382
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,829
and I'll have you locked up
in an asylum.

1383
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:49,270
Show me your face.

1384
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:51,039
Now. You owe it to me.

1385
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:12,311
César...

1386
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:16,311
Look in the mirror and tell me
if you think you're disfigured.

1387
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:21,791
God!

1388
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,231
Why do you keep seeing
what isn't there?

1389
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,392
- You look fine.
- I'm a monster!

1390
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:29,917
What do you mean?
Anybody'd like to have your face.

1391
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:31,395
You look normal.

1392
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:33,518
Not just normal.
You're handsome!

1393
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:38,916
César, listen. Maybe you've got
something like anorexia.

1394
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:42,398
Some girls insist they're fat
and end up crazy.

1395
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:43,750
César!

1396
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:47,074
I want to wake up!

1397
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,837
I want to wake up!

1398
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:52,676
- Hold it!
- I want to wake up!

1399
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:54,071
Fuck!

1400
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:56,351
Shit!

1401
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:57,990
Freeze!

1402
01:38:58,320 --> 01:38:59,231
Don't shoot!

1403
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:01,314
This is a nightmare!

1404
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,360
It's a nightmare!

1405
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:16,515
You! Wait a minute!

1406
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:17,949
You're not to leave!

1407
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:19,711
Stop!

1408
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:29,798
Wait a minute!

1409
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:46,950
It's a dream!

1410
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,195
It's a dream!

1411
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:07,030
Don't move!

1412
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:10,831
Drop the gun!

1413
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:14,036
I want to wake up.

1414
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:16,072
- I want to wake up.
- Don't move!

1415
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:17,910
I want to wake up!

1416
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:30,631
Antonio.

1417
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:34,276
Antonio!

1418
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:36,711
What?

1419
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:39,314
You're crushing me.

1420
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:44,436
I'd better not move.
I've been shot in the back.

1421
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:47,390
How do you know?

1422
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:50,311
Well...

1423
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:52,836
Because...

1424
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:08,080
What's going on here?

1425
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:11,358
What the fuck's going on?

1426
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:13,193
I told you, it's a dream.

1427
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:14,714
Shut up! Shut up!

1428
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,794
I know what this is.

1429
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,277
It's one of those
Candid Camera jokes.

1430
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:25,034
You did a great job, I loved it,
but enough's enough!

1431
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:26,230
I see someone.

1432
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:27,351
Where?

1433
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:29,359
Up there, on the roof.

1434
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:31,075
I can't see a thing.

1435
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,116
Where are you going?

1436
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:39,714
Come on, Antonio.
Don't think about it anymore.

1437
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:41,270
Or you'll go crazy.

1438
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,036
Hello, César.

1439
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:02,237
It's time I introduced myself.

1440
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:05,672
My name is Serge Duvernois.
I represent Life Extension.

1441
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:07,474
We met...

1442
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:09,670
150 years ago.

1443
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,751
What?

1444
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:13,515
- Has the world gone mad?
- There is no world.

1445
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:15,712
It's all in
that gentleman's mind.

1446
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:17,954
Including you and I.

1447
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:20,590
Sure! Shall I thump you
to see if it hurts?

1448
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:21,711
Try it.

1449
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:25,709
They can make you disappear
right now, like everyone else.

1450
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:28,560
- And who are they, may I ask?
- The company.

1451
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:30,350
Life Extension.

1452
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,997
They know everything
we're saying.

1453
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:36,672
They even know what is going
through César's mind now...

1454
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:38,957
an instant after
he thinks it.

1455
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:42,312
If they can make me disappear,
why haven't they done it?

1456
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:44,352
It would be virtually incorrect.

1457
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:46,478
You've just saved his life.

1458
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:50,031
Virtually incorrect? Do you
think I'm an idiot or what?

1459
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:52,795
No, quite the opposite.
You're a great guy.

1460
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,160
A character who is very
necessary for César.

1461
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:58,156
A character?

1462
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:02,080
- Where are you going?
- To look for someone.

1463
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:03,076
There is no one.

1464
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:05,192
People aren't necessary now.

1465
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,873
Why didn't you wake me before?

1466
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,240
You only had to ask.

1467
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:19,359
But that was difficult...

1468
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:21,313
because, in theory...

1469
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:23,557
you couldn't know
you were dreaming.

1470
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:24,910
Since when?

1471
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:27,112
Remember the day
of the discotheque?

1472
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:30,994
That night, when you fell asleep
on the sidewalk...

1473
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:33,271
was the one chosen
for the splice.

1474
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:35,039
- What splice?
- The splice...

1475
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:37,960
between your real life
and your virtual life.

1476
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:41,632
A splice of 150 years
which you didn't notice...

1477
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:44,275
because you were dead,
and frozen.

1478
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,318
From when you woke up...

1479
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:48,556
nothing was real.

1480
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:52,639
We wiped what really happened
from your memory.

1481
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:54,716
What was it?

1482
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:58,153
You never saw Sofía again.

1483
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:01,952
And the doctors were never able
to rebuild your face.

1484
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:06,711
You woke up on that street
with an awful hangover.

1485
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:09,597
You shut yourself away
for months.

1486
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:12,236
One day you learned
that we existed.

1487
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:15,394
You came to the office,
you signed the contract...

1488
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:16,951
and then...

1489
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:20,080
you killed yourself.

1490
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:23,360
I paid for this?

1491
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:26,716
I paid for Nuria
to come back as Sofía?

1492
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:29,996
I paid to look like
a monster again?

1493
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:32,038
I paid to live this nightmare?

1494
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:34,197
You paid to live
whatever you wanted.

1495
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:37,359
We just provided the setting
and the characters.

1496
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:39,199
You invented your hell.

1497
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:41,312
I tried to warn you in that bar.

1498
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:43,831
I said it all depended
on your mind.

1499
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:46,314
Do I just have to want it?

1500
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:50,389
- Can Antonio come...
- There's no one here.

1501
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:54,074
They can't have made 4 million
people disappear!

1502
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:57,273
You've overcome your fears.

1503
01:44:57,640 --> 01:44:59,438
If you want, we can try again...

1504
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:02,031
have you live
a wonderful dream...

1505
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:05,392
with money, friends, Sofía,
or whatever girl you want.

1506
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:06,790
You just have to ask.

1507
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:11,549
I don't want more dreams.

1508
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:12,830
It isn't a dream!

1509
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:15,395
César, listen to me.

1510
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:17,712
This is real.
This man is a sham.

1511
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:19,559
Let's go down
and look for people.

1512
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:23,753
Ignore him. It's logical
for him to behave like this...

1513
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:25,752
but he doesn't
feel anything.

1514
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:27,640
I don't feel anything?

1515
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:31,471
I don't feel anything? What do
you know about what I feel?

1516
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:33,194
Ignore him, he isn't real.

1517
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:34,920
Yes, I am real!

1518
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:37,991
I've got a wife,
and two daughters.

1519
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:41,916
His personality is designed
so that he'll say all this now.

1520
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:43,514
Where are my daughters?

1521
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:45,479
- God!
- César...

1522
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,877
We can offer you
another possibility.

1523
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:50,879
In 1997, it was impossible
to rebuild your face.

1524
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:54,432
But out there
it's the year 2145.

1525
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:57,952
You wouldn't believe
the things surgery can do.

1526
01:45:58,160 --> 01:45:59,514
You could wake up...

1527
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:02,315
and live in the future
like a normal person.

1528
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:04,071
In the future?

1529
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:06,190
You have to choose.

1530
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:10,880
How could I wake up?

1531
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:14,194
How would you wake
from your worst nightmare?

1532
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:22,758
No, César, don't listen to him!

1533
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,400
Your partners set this up!

1534
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:27,593
- They want you to kill yourself!
- He's done that.

1535
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:29,433
Now it'll just be a formality.

1536
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:31,676
I'm going to do it.

1537
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,231
Very well.

1538
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:38,191
Do you have any wish
before you... die?

1539
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:53,992
Let them out there read my mind.

1540
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:57,437
Who are you?

1541
01:47:58,720 --> 01:47:59,995
I don't know.

1542
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:03,672
Don't keep suffering.
It's all in your head.

1543
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:05,712
It's all psychological.

1544
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:32,430
Come on, César.

1545
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:49,438
- What will happen to them?
- Don't prolong this farewell.

1546
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:52,519
You think they're your friends,
but they're just images.

1547
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:54,952
That man isn't really crying.

1548
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:19,358
I forgot, I get vertigo.

1549
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:21,309
Then don't look.

1550
01:49:23,680 --> 01:49:24,796
Good-bye, César.

1551
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:07,960
Relax.

1552
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:11,515
Relax.

1553
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:15,400
Open your eyes.
