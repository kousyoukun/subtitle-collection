1
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,360
Open your eyes.

2
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,630
Open your eyes.

3
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,865
Open your eyes.

4
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:11,170
Open your eyes.

5
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,470
Open your eyes.

6
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,705
Open your eyes.

7
00:01:16,575 --> 00:01:18,010
Open your eyes.

8
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,210
Open your eyes.

9
00:03:47,225 --> 00:03:48,660
Open your eyes.

10
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,535
Why tell me that dream?

11
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:01,095
You said I could tell you
whatever I wanted.

12
00:04:01,205 --> 00:04:04,040
All right. Anything else you
should tell me before we start?

13
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,135
Nothing you don't know.
I was about to turn 25.

14
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,810
I liked eating, sleeping,
making love, like everyone.

15
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,045
And you know what everyone
does when they get up.

16
00:04:16,355 --> 00:04:19,220
OPEN YOUR EYES

17
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,545
Where are you going?

18
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,054
Out.

19
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,952
Stop leaving messages on the alarm.

20
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,425
Why?

21
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,594
Just don't.

22
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,534
Because it pisses me off.

23
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,661
Come on, for fuck's sake.

24
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,732
- I'll slaughter you.
- We'll see about that.

25
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:53,107
You've got three cars.
Why do we always go in this wreck?

26
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,009
Come on. I'm in a hurry.

27
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,777
Are you backing out?
I missed class for this.

28
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:01,411
I'm seeing my partners after.
Why do you think I'm dressed up?

29
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,285
So you can shout at them.
You like that.

30
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,255
I don't shout.

31
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,688
- So tell me, did you screw her?
- Screw who?

32
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,957
Whoever was there
when I rang last night.

33
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:15,591
I was alone last night.
Anyway, what is it to you?

34
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,431
Nothing. You can do what you want
with your life.

35
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,300
Thanks very much.

36
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,271
Let's change the subject.

37
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,379
- Did you screw her?
- Give me a break. I was on my own.

38
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,541
So, you did. Was it the one
you talk so much about?

39
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,550
- Who?
- That Nuria.

40
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,119
My God, I can't believe it!

41
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,191
César seeing the same woman twice!

42
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,056
- She must be great in bed.
- She isn't bad.

43
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,154
Bastard! When are you going
to tell me the secret?

44
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,323
- What secret?
- The recipe for Coca-Cola.

45
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,924
- Look, the kind you like.
- Yeah. Change the--

46
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,234
What did you eat today?

47
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,643
Nothing. That's my problem.
I'm starved!

48
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,814
It's funny when you ask them
what they value most in a man.

49
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:08,614
''I like him to be intelligent,
to be honest, to be kind.''

50
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:12,021
It's all shit! You'd have problems
if you were like me.

51
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,388
Not that again!
You aren't ugly.

52
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,088
Anybody would like to have
your face. You're normal.

53
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,894
- Normal. That doesn't mean handsome.
- You're handsome.

54
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,060
I'm acceptable,
when you're not beside me.

55
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,163
You're like anorexics. They insist
they're fat, and end up crazy.

56
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,766
When some girl ties you down,
the rest of us will get a chance.

57
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,675
- Yeah, yeah.
- Why not?

58
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,713
If you meet the right girl--

59
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,113
She doesn't exist.

60
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,811
Shit!

61
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:43,752
- How did I miss that?
- God punished you.

62
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,983
You're for it.

63
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,856
- Who are you saying that to?
- To God.

64
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,927
Do you believe in God?

65
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,867
- Don't start all that shit.
- I just asked a question.

66
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,666
If you don't want to,
don't answer.

67
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,465
I don't believe in God.

68
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,445
How do you explain
what happened?

69
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,779
- How do you mean?
- Your face.

70
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,445
- There is no explanation.
- I believe there is.

71
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,116
- You believe I'm mad.
- I only believe what I see.

72
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,455
You haven't let me see
your face yet.

73
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,461
And I won't.

74
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,158
Do you really think
you're a monster, César?

75
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,997
- Come on, let me see.
- Stick your hand up your ass!

76
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,903
Take it easy, brat!
I'm sick of all your stories.

77
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,907
- Leave me alone!
- I'll kick the shit out of you!

78
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,442
Leave me alone!

79
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,445
I can't work with you in here.
Leave us on our own.

80
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,311
On my responsibility.

81
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,179
You're just a spoiled brat who--

82
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,655
My parents are dead, asshole!

83
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,658
You made up a story
so as not to admit what you did.

84
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,601
Is that true?

85
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,131
What?

86
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,106
That you're a spoiled brat.

87
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:16,404
My father had a restaurant chain.
That's not my fault.

88
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,551
When did your parents die?

89
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,922
Fifteen years ago,
in an accident.

90
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:28,216
- And now you're rich.
- So they say.

91
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,559
Then why don't you want
a lawyer?

92
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,000
They say they can get me
the best.

93
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,128
- But they want me stuck here forever.
- Who are they?

94
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:43,106
My partners. They've been sucking
my blood since I was a kid.

95
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,977
Now they've got everything.
They've cut me out.

96
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,048
It wasn't them.
It was me.

97
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:54,145
I don't care.

98
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,556
Let's see, César.
Do you know why you're here?

99
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:03,323
- Because I wear a mask, I guess.
- No.

100
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,329
Because you killed someone.

101
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,266
Or don't you remember?

102
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:12,667
- Tell me, don't you remember?
- Fuck! Stop it!

103
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,172
We must get things clear
if you want us to get on.

104
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:16,899
I don't want us to get on!

105
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,206
Is your solution to sit
in this hole and not talk?

106
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,906
- Aren't we talking now?
- After two months.

107
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,019
I've been trying
for two months.

108
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,351
- Read the reports.
- I've read them.

109
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,392
I want you to tell me,
if possible, sitting on a chair.

110
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,723
Or are you going to stay there?

111
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,694
I like the floor.

112
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,962
It's the only thing
that seems real.

113
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,469
What does everything else seem?

114
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,472
Everything else is a lie.

115
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,340
All this seems a lie,
including you.

116
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,708
You don't even wear a white coat.

117
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:56,805
- Do you think I should?
- Doctors wear them.

118
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,907
I took it off so you'd forget
I was a doctor.

119
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,452
So that you'd like me more.

120
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,954
It didn't work.
I hate the sight of you.

121
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,095
Now that we're friends--

122
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,961
- I've got no friends.
- Tell me what happened.

123
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,660
The sooner you talk,
the sooner I'll go.

124
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:40,820
Hey! Happy birthday and all
the things people usually say.

125
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,826
Thank you, thank you.

126
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:47,028
- Where did you find her?
- In the library.

127
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,465
- She tried to steal my book.
- It was mine.

128
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:52,560
- Anyway, César, Sofia.
- Hello.

129
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,271
Happy birthday.

130
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,102
- Thank you.
- Your present.

131
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:00,542
- Thanks a lot.
- We bought it between us.

132
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,946
Then I have to thank
both of you.

133
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,017
Stop chatting her up
and open it.

134
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,382
- I'd rather open them tomorrow.
- Whatever.

135
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,978
- Like a drink?
- Sure.

136
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,250
I'll leave this upstairs.

137
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,570
Hello.

138
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,817
- What are you doing here?
- Happy birthday, darling.

139
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,411
Thank you.

140
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,753
But I didn't ask you
to the party.

141
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,986
That was nice of you.

142
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,459
I brought you a present, too.
Why not open it?

143
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,366
No, thanks. I already know
what's inside.

144
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,375
- And last night?
- Listen, Nuria.

145
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:09,038
I don't like you just turning up,
much less coming into my room.

146
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,914
- Well! Do I have to apologize?
- No.

147
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,612
You have to go.

148
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,680
Right. I know what it is.

149
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,258
You don't want to be seen twice
with the same girl.

150
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,351
It would ruin your reputation.

151
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,625
- You got it in one.
- And there's someone else.

152
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,963
- Right?
- Who?

153
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,232
The brunette you were talking to
a minute ago?

154
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,863
Well, she's not bad.

155
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,267
I don't care.

156
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,778
I don't need to be seen
with you.

157
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,185
Hold me.

158
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,223
Come on.

159
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,189
A little kiss.

160
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,530
Come on.

161
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,481
Until when?
Until next Friday?

162
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,017
Can you manage a weekend
without me?

163
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,954
Excuse me. I must see
to my guests.

164
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:28,424
Yes, the brunette will take time.
She looks that type.

165
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,095
- That type?
- Yes.

166
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,859
The kind who can't find
your zipper.

167
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,301
- Hello.
- Hello.

168
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,808
- What did you want?
- To open this.

169
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,275
Wait.

170
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,243
I'll serve you.

171
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,142
Since when are you the waiter?

172
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,618
Don't you know I'm in catering?

173
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,914
Are you all right?

174
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:03,553
- Can't you tell I'm elbowing in?
- A bit.

175
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,597
I've got a slight problem.

176
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,689
- A girl's chasing me.
- You don't say.

177
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,702
- I need help to get rid of her.
- And I'm that help.

178
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,328
Shit! There she is!

179
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:17,170
- Where?
- Don't look. Look over here.

180
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,801
That's it. Yes.

181
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,380
Yes, yes, yes.

182
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,382
- Here we are.
- Here we are.

183
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:31,312
Well, act as if we were talking about
something real interesting.

184
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,259
Nod your head, agree,
say yes.

185
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,520
You know.

186
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,495
- What a nice conversation.
- Yes.

187
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,624
- And she's coming this way.
- Fuck!

188
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:48,000
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry, I'll guide you.

189
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,371
- Straight on.
- I don't see her.

190
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,910
Here it is.
Go right in.

191
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,345
- I'm not going in there.
- Well, I am. So long.

192
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,759
- He's in here.
- You--

193
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:14,257
Well, we're safe.

194
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,168
But we've got nothing
to drink here.

195
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:20,103
I think all you really want
is to chat with me.

196
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:24,141
Yes, that too.
First, I want to save my skin.

197
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,575
Can't you say
you aren't interested?

198
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,238
She wouldn't care.
She never gets tired.

199
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,213
- She must be feeling bad.
- Yeah.

200
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,681
Of course.

201
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,933
So you're studying drama,
like Pelayo?

202
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,664
- For now.
- Scenography?

203
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,731
- Acting.
- Really? To be an actress?

204
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,174
I am an actress.
Is that a problem?

205
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,245
Yes. Aren't you ashamed?

206
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:05,976
Ashamed?
Why should I be ashamed?

207
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,746
Actors aren't honest.

208
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:11,016
You're able to show emotions
you don't have...

209
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,684
or which, at most,
you invent.

210
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,886
Right now you could be thinking...

211
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,452
''This guy is a real drag.
How can I dump him?''

212
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:22,660
- Really?
- ''And in catering. A pain in the ass.''

213
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,896
But you're a good actress.
It doesn't show.

214
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,750
- Hey, Pelayo!
- I caught you.

215
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,452
- Come in.
- How's it going?

216
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,687
Great. I'm a bit out of it now.

217
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,286
Drunk, you mean.

218
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,763
Why are you in here?

219
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,667
Sofia was protecting me
from a female psychopath out there.

220
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,898
- She seemed dangerous.
- Yeah.

221
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:06,411
- What about you?
- I was drinking. Women don't chase me.

222
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,003
- We're out of drink.
- Here.

223
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:11,082
- Shit.
- I'll get some more.

224
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,382
For all of us.

225
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,759
Well, I guess I'll be going.

226
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,661
- Why?
- I'm drunk and don't feel well.

227
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,028
Don't be stupid.
It's just starting.

228
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:32,263
- For you, it is.
- Pelayo, you can't go.

229
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,328
You're my guest of honor.

230
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,541
You're a son of a bitch, César.

231
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,305
- Why'd you say that?
- The party's full of girls.

232
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:43,780
I go for a piss, you start
talking to her, and--

233
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,680
What?

234
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,953
Nothing. And I look like
an asshole.

235
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,785
Tell me what's wrong.

236
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:57,419
- Why do you have to chat up Sofia?
- No one's chatting up Sofia.

237
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,429
Yeah, and I'm blind, right?

238
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,857
You're certainly drunk.

239
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,407
I'm drunk,
but I'll tell you this.

240
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,568
I like Sofia a hell of a lot.

241
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:16,011
She may even be
the girl of my dreams.

242
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:20,108
But if she fucks up our friendship,
she can go to hell.

243
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,517
I feel the same.

244
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:24,021
Sure.

245
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:35,164
Pelayo, where are you going?

246
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,168
- Home.
- Already?

247
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,898
- Yeah, I'm wrecked.
- I'll come with you.

248
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,496
Don't bother. You stay.

249
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,202
Are you going, too?

250
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,944
I have to get up early.

251
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,571
I can run you home later.

252
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,080
Stay on. I'm leaving you
in good hands.

253
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,558
What's wrong with him?

254
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,651
He's drunk.

255
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,252
- Is he annoyed with us?
- No.

256
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,729
You sure?

257
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,037
She doesn't look too happy.

258
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,231
Didn't you have to get up early?

259
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,911
I'm doing too much
for you tonight.

260
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:24,081
- Maybe it means something.
- Yeah. That you've got a nerve.

261
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,083
It's just for a minute.

262
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,847
Long enough for my friend Nuria
to admit defeat.

263
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,422
This is my place.

264
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,721
- Don't dare laugh at it.
- Why would I laugh?

265
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,694
It's nothing special,
but it's cheap.

266
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,561
- Do you like clowns?
- They're not clowns.

267
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,003
They're mime artists.

268
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,471
Pancho!

269
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,736
- I've got a cat.
- I hate cats.

270
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,781
They're almost as false
as actresses.

271
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,941
Says the caterer.

272
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,252
How do you pay for this?

273
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,916
Do your parents help?
Do you work?

274
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,687
He's real nosy,
isn't he, Pancho?

275
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,694
I'm an arms dealer.

276
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:15,130
Fancy that! I always wanted to know
how arms dealers lived.

277
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,134
Now you do.

278
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,355
How can I eplain it to you?

279
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:47,093
You wouldn't understand.
Even I don't understand.

280
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:51,761
She was making coffee
and I started snooping around.

281
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,738
Suddenly, I got this stupid feeling
a lot of people get.

282
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,502
Well, I like it.

283
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,976
- What did you feel?
- That I loved her.

284
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,446
- God, I'm even embarrassed to say it.
- I didn't hear you.

285
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,616
I said I like your place.

286
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:10,085
And I like yours.
Let's swap.

287
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:12,816
You wouldn't like it
tomorrow morning.

288
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,883
I said it because of the decor.

289
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,792
Your place is more personal.

290
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,491
- And warmer.
- Warmer?

291
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,000
- Yes.
- You think my house is cold?

292
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,264
- A bit.
- And am I?

293
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:29,067
- I don't know.
- You said my house seemed cold.

294
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:33,202
If you're waiting for me
to list your virtues, hard luck.

295
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,608
You think you're real smart.

296
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,580
- Maybe.
- Well, you're wrong.

297
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,083
I don't need you
to list my virtues.

298
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:43,484
No, I'm sure you know
what they are.

299
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,989
- But you'd like me to see them, too.
- So you say.

300
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,060
I'm not going
to argue about it.

301
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:53,460
-Just as well. You'd lose.
- Oh, yeah?

302
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:57,763
But I don't want to argue either.
I propose we do the opposite.

303
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:00,394
- We don't argue?
- We show our defects.

304
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,506
Great!

305
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,488
I hope you're being fair.

306
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,751
This is absolutely you.

307
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,263
Well, mine is finished.

308
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,128
Fuck!
That's how you see me?

309
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,371
- Did I go too far?
- Sign it.

310
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,708
Let's see mine.

311
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,252
It's lovely!

312
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,855
- It's not a caricature.
- You see.

313
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,426
You draw beautifully.

314
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,088
- I'll sell it to you.
- Miser. How much?

315
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,563
As it's you,
I'll sell it for...

316
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,065
a kiss.

317
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,640
That smile's going to kill me!

318
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:18,677
It would be wrong
if we did anything tonight.

319
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,813
- Why?
- Pelayo. Remember?

320
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,120
Your best friend.

321
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:29,120
He doesn't have to find out.
Besides, he'd do the same.

322
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:32,723
I see friendship
really matters to you.

323
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:36,198
It does. That's why
I wouldn't tell him.

324
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:46,566
Some people...

325
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:50,876
say that they would be happy
with a normal life span.

326
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:54,247
But ''normal''means different things,
depending on--

327
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:56,513
What are you looking at?

328
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,488
I'm watching TV.

329
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:02,493
The Romans, for instance,
lived only 25 years.

330
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,994
Today...

331
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,496
that figure has tripled,
which means that--

332
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:11,525
- What the fuck is he on about?
- I saw this before.

333
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,537
It's about cryonization.

334
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,402
Cryo what?

335
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,873
When they freeze you
or something.

336
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:20,909
Like Walt Disney.

337
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,680
Wow, that's cold!

338
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,150
Hey, you!

339
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,912
There won't be a landslide.

340
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:32,319
It isn't dangerous. The ground
is firm here and very solid.

341
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:38,423
- Are you leaving?
- I'm going home. Here's my number.

342
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,158
But I'll call tomorrow.

343
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,757
What for?

344
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:49,367
All right, I won't call.

345
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:53,104
- César?
- What is it?

346
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:56,510
Come here.
I want to tell you a secret.

347
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,190
Come here.

348
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:45,819
Hello, darling.

349
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,757
Did you follow me?

350
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,097
Of course I didn't.

351
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,229
But I had the feeling
we'd meet.

352
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,103
- How was the brunette?
- Good. Why?

353
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,838
From your face, I'd say
you didn't sleep with her.

354
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:04,779
Let me guess. You didn't sleep
with her, but you don't mind.

355
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:08,643
You have all the time
in the world for that.

356
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:11,187
And I bet you're
seeing her tomorrow.

357
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:14,053
- Brilliant.
- Aren't I? There's more.

358
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,457
- Well?
- I scored at the party, too.

359
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,861
But he wasn't up for it,
so I'm still hot for it.

360
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,933
- And?
- And until you meet up again...

361
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,798
with your Miss Universe,
you could have fun.

362
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,130
No. I think I prefer
to go home and sleep.

363
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,336
Come on, César.
It's your birthday.

364
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,976
- Skip it. I'm going home.
- What's up, César?

365
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,541
Are you scared?

366
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:25,524
- Want some of this?
- No, thanks.

367
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,622
Sure, act innocent now.

368
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:30,257
I don't need that
to enjoy myself.

369
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,029
I see that.

370
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,428
That's not a good idea.

371
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,575
Do what you want.

372
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,607
What's happiness for you?

373
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,981
- What?
- For me, this is happiness.

374
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:53,489
Being here with you.
What about you?

375
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:57,618
I can't handle heavy conversations
right now.

376
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:03,132
Your thoughts are
somewhere else, right?

377
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:04,758
Maybe.

378
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,044
One thing really bothers me.

379
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:19,907
- What?
- You know nothing about me.

380
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,282
Except my name's Nuria
and I'm a good fuck.

381
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:23,980
Two important things.

382
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:26,454
You don't know my address
or telephone number.

383
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:31,827
We have to start somewhere.
I'm going to see your house now.

384
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:35,064
It's not far.

385
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,943
Tell me something.

386
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,605
Do you believe in God?

387
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

388
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,946
- How are you?
- You got home all right?

389
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:01,576
Yeah. Well, I had
a horrible dream.

390
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:04,018
That you never saw me again.

391
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:07,285
Yes. I came out of your house,
go to my car...

392
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,656
and that crazy bitch
has been following me.

393
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,854
- Who, that Nuria?
- Yes.

394
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,864
She comes over and says,
''Want a lift?''

395
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,526
She goes on so much
I don't know how to say no.

396
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:20,128
So I get in the car,
she drives faster and faster...

397
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,138
and kills herself.

398
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,105
- With me inside.
- That's horrible.

399
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:25,709
But the worst part...

400
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,769
is that my face
is completely destroyed...

401
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,678
like ''The Phantom of the Opera.''

402
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,479
I couldn't wake up.

403
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:36,450
I was a monster.

404
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,117
You're a monster anyway.

405
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:44,058
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. I'm a monster, too.

406
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,959
Look.

407
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,599
How was your house?

408
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,604
Was anyone left?

409
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,906
Left where?

410
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,308
In your house.
There was a party, remember?

411
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:03,375
A party?

412
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,588
Dreaming is shit.

413
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:15,392
Unless the dream was nice.

414
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,690
In the park, children playing,
a girl who loves you.

415
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,423
That's why.

416
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,296
Then you wake up
and you want to die.

417
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:36,372
At first, I didn't even have
the strength to react.

418
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:38,881
I'd been in a coma
for three weeks.

419
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:40,610
You were lucky.

420
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,880
You could've died
like Nuria.

421
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:46,354
And what?
I would've been better off.

422
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:48,448
Did you see her body?

423
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,290
- I never did.
- You think she didn't die?

424
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:53,887
I'm like you.

425
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:56,990
I only believe what I see.

426
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:01,304
César, show me your face,
please.

427
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,862
- What for?
- Look.

428
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,602
It's true you had an accident.
It's true...

429
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,803
that you were disfigured,
but not anymore.

430
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,313
Take that off.
The doctors fixed you.

431
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,645
They didn't have
a fucking clue!

432
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:16,346
In the accident, you didn't lose
just skin and some muscle.

433
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:20,551
The blow was so severe it caused
a multiple fracture of the skull.

434
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:23,593
We secured the osseous structure
with metal wires...

435
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:26,788
and over that,
we reinserted the muscles...

436
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,798
we could still retrieve.

437
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,368
Yes, very nice,
but I know all that.

438
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:34,030
I've had it explained to me
1 50 times.

439
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,073
But you never say
when you'll operate.

440
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:40,440
- I've been waiting two months.
- But we've operated three times.

441
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:43,878
I wouldn't call that
an operation. I'd call it--

442
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:47,907
Well, I don't know
what you'd call it.

443
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,146
The symmetry isn't perfect...

444
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,815
but what we've done with your face is,
if I may say so...

445
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,449
a craftsman's job.

446
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,824
We can't work on skin
which is pure scars.

447
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,193
No, no, there must be some way.

448
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,697
- What?
- ''What?''

449
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,927
You're the doctors, aren't you?

450
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,169
A transplant, whatever!

451
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:10,638
There's a problem with fibrosis,
if we operate again...

452
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:12,766
we may just cause
further damage.

453
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,402
We'd need
millimetric precision...

454
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,505
and as of today
it's impossible.

455
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:22,049
Let's look at this.
I'm not an idiot.

456
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,486
Today, people change
their breasts.

457
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,614
They have hair implants.

458
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:29,726
They even change the color
of their skin.

459
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,490
Are you saying that on
the threshold of the year 2000...

460
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:37,830
you can't do a simple operation
and sort out this fuck-up?

461
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:41,393
- It isn't so simple, César. Remember--
- Don't patronize me!

462
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,372
Stop treating me like a child!

463
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:49,011
I'm not just any patient.

464
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:51,479
And this isn't a welfare hospital.

465
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,219
I'm willing to pay any amount.

466
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,056
You're in charge.

467
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,624
They say you're the best
in your field.

468
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:07,687
Well, invent something.
Experiment with me.

469
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:10,767
I've seen patients
who've lost all their features...

470
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,700
who can't even talk.

471
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:15,772
At least you can look yourself
in the eyes.

472
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,331
What good is that?

473
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:21,036
Every time I look in the mirror,
I want to die.

474
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:23,272
Your case isn't so serious.

475
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,247
Just learn to accept it.

476
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,715
And who will accept me?

477
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:31,083
Will you explain to the people
who look at me in the street?

478
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:35,490
Will you tell them
that looks aren't important?

479
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,926
That beauty is on the inside?

480
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,962
We'd like to show you something.

481
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,656
What is this?

482
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,386
A facial prosthesis.

483
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:12,621
We use it in extreme cases
of rejection like yours.

484
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,271
This is shit!

485
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:25,808
It's not the best solution...

486
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,242
but it's all we can do
for the moment.

487
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:31,315
I want a face!
Not a mask!

488
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,411
I don't work miracles.

489
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,851
That's what the bastard said.

490
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,255
But in the end, they did.

491
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:43,716
Did what?

492
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,227
Work a miracle.

493
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,629
So it seems.

494
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,496
So it seems?
Things are or they aren't?

495
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,832
- Did they do it or not?
- I'm tired. Why don't you go?

496
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,840
I'll be back on Tuesday.
Want anything?

497
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,812
- No.
- All right. See you on Tuesday.

498
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,882
A pad and a pencil.

499
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,510
But don't tell them.
I don't want to owe them anything.

500
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,797
Have I changed so much?

501
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:50,807
Because I recognize you.

502
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:58,280
How are you?

503
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:00,247
''How are you?''

504
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:05,653
You're playing a part now, but I don't
know what. Your lips are smiling.

505
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,588
- But your eyes are trembling.
- What?

506
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:11,058
You're really very good
as an actress.

507
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:14,562
I asked you how you were.
You didn't answer.

508
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:18,227
I'm alive.
How should I be?

509
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,098
And I'm tired.

510
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:24,504
Tired of waiting for you to call,
even to say ''Tough luck.''

511
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:27,169
- I was busy.
- Bullshit!

512
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,709
I was afraid you'd feel uncomfortable
if I rang.

513
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:38,249
You were afraid
you'd feel uncomfortable.

514
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:42,314
Afraid you couldn't
look me in the face, like now.

515
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:55,504
That's not true.

516
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,823
I've often dreamed
of this moment.

517
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,324
What moment?

518
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:23,233
The moment we'd meet again.

519
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,201
In my dream,
we were just like this.

520
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:28,771
Here, in the park.

521
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:32,842
Although something was different.

522
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,273
What?

523
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:43,413
It wasn't raining.

524
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:47,748
I have to go, César.

525
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:51,852
- What are you doing tomorrow night?
- Studying. I'm very busy.

526
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,931
- It's Friday. We could meet.
- I've got a lot to do.

527
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:57,194
All right, so long.

528
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:01,028
César!

529
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:05,634
We'll meet if you want.

530
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:08,277
If you want.

531
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:13,612
As soon as there is
the slightest possibility of death...

532
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:16,710
the stabilization and transport team
goes into action.

533
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,015
Once the client is declared
legally dead...

534
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:22,058
he is put into
a maintenance capsule...

535
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,526
and the transport legalities
are sorted out.

536
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:28,190
In the storeroom in Arizona
in the U.S.A...

537
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:32,064
a team of specialists prepare the body
for final freezing.

538
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,698
Among other measures...

539
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:39,106
blood is replaced by a solution
which preserves the organs.

540
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,239
Finally...

541
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,610
the client is put
in the capsule....

542
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:47,843
where he will remain
until medicine can reenergize him.

543
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,983
To be honest,
I'd have to think it over.

544
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:57,653
It's hard to accept the idea.

545
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:00,162
How should we view it?

546
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:04,758
We are, undoubtedly,
facing a major development...

547
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,803
a new challenge for humanity.

548
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:11,306
It's understandable that
the first reaction is rejection.

549
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:14,400
We have now got the means
to do it.

550
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:16,810
We've got the technology.

551
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:20,406
But, above all, we have
sufficient moral maturity...

552
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:23,452
to understand what
this new step means...

553
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,455
for human evolution,
to look at the future...

554
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,651
and put an end to certain
meaningless taboos...

555
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,285
inherited from ancient religions...

556
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,126
old and useless memories.

557
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,700
Thank you for speaking to us.

558
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:39,565
And thank you
to our audience--

559
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,288
- Hi.
- Hi.

560
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:11,801
- What's that?
- Shit, isn't it?

561
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:14,735
But they suggested I wear it
in case of infection.

562
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:21,433
Well, kid, what're you up to?

563
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:23,705
Arguing with doctors all day.

564
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:25,839
- You should go out more.
- I'm trying.

565
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:29,009
- What're you having?
- Rum and Coke. You want one?

566
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,020
- Yes.
- I'll get you one.

567
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,181
I'm going to the bathroom.

568
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:39,223
- Take that off.
- Why?

569
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:42,696
Don't you realize you won't
be able to hide your face?

570
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:46,033
I told you,
it's to stop infections.

571
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,603
Sure.

572
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:51,266
If you're embarrassed, just go.
Nobody asked you to come.

573
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:53,434
- Sofia did.
- What?

574
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:57,737
- She didn't want to be alone with you.
- Why not?

575
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:01,284
- You're giving her a hard time.
- I'm having a hard time.

576
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:03,512
Talk to a psychologist,
or to me.

577
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,180
Don't take it out on a girl
you met once.

578
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,053
Did she say that?

579
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,261
Did she say that?

580
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:15,092
- Bitch!
- Come back!

581
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,967
Whiskey and Coke.

582
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:28,273
- What whiskey?
- What did you say?

583
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:33,380
What whiskey?

584
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,975
Why don't you ask me
to my face, son of a bitch?

585
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,124
Ballantine's.

586
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,617
- Same again.
- No, this one's on me.

587
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:14,718
- Why?
-Just is.

588
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:53,923
Fix your face, man!

589
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:43,435
- Hello.
- Hello.

590
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:47,499
- Where were you?
- Around.

591
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,511
Pelayo went to look for you.

592
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:53,449
And I came to look for you.

593
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,983
Why?

594
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:57,019
To-- No reason.

595
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:01,055
To buy you a drink.

596
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:05,726
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks.

597
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:11,495
Can you tell I'm elbowing in?

598
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:14,968
The thing is,
I've got a problem.

599
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:19,975
A girl's chasing me, and I need
some help to get rid of her.

600
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,944
Shit, shit, shit!
She's coming this way.

601
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:26,504
She's coming this way.
Don't look. Don't look.

602
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:31,644
You carry on talking,
act as if he weren't here.

603
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,655
I mean, as if I were here.

604
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,850
Keep talking.
Tra-la-lee, tra-la-la.

605
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:39,417
What a lovely conversation
we're having.

606
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,632
So that's it, here we are...

607
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:48,465
having a bit of a chat
about life.

608
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:49,937
That's enough!

609
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,449
Where the hell were you?

610
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:06,120
Around.

611
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:08,984
I'm leaving. I'm tired.

612
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:12,426
You two stay if you want.

613
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:22,166
Well, this is where
I leave you.

614
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:25,002
- I'll see you home.
- No, I live very close.

615
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,076
- I've got the motorbike.
- No.

616
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:29,771
- Don't be silly.
- Lay off, Pelayo.

617
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:31,837
She wants to go on her own.

618
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:34,179
Shut up. You're drunk.

619
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:38,017
I might be drunk,
but I'm not an idiot.

620
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:41,522
- Anyway, I'm not drunk.
- Really, you needn't bother.

621
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:44,754
- As you wish.
- You're the one who's drunk.

622
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:47,694
We'll call you to meet
some other day.

623
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:49,924
All right. We could go
to the movies.

624
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:51,933
- You hear?
- Great!

625
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:54,162
Well, that's it, then.

626
00:52:56,673 --> 00:53:00,973
No, don't kiss me. You might
get poisoned by my drunken breath.

627
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:05,208
Well, we'll meet up soon.

628
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:06,680
Sure.

629
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:09,682
We'll meet up soon.

630
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,201
It's not cold.

631
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,276
Well...

632
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:40,682
I'm gonna have to go.

633
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,741
Where are you going?

634
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:45,185
I've just remembered
my bike is back there.

635
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:49,316
- I'll go with you.
- No. Why? You're almost home now.

636
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:52,327
- See you tomorrow.
- Pelayo, wait a minute.

637
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:55,526
What?

638
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:03,805
I don't know.

639
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:08,141
You drank too much.
We'll talk tomorrow if you want.

640
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,271
- Tomorrow I'll wish I were dead.
- You won't.

641
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,372
You just need to rest.

642
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:15,850
Pelayo!

643
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,824
You're my best friend.

644
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:46,047
Son of a bitch!

645
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:10,927
Open your eyes.

646
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,607
César.

647
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,117
It's me.

648
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:35,688
Sofia!

649
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:39,753
- What are you doing here?
- Forgive me.

650
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:41,126
Why?

651
00:56:58,114 --> 00:57:00,048
I love you.

652
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,088
Come on.

653
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:15,322
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

654
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:18,424
I still can't believe
this is really happening.

655
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:22,627
Where's Pelayo?

656
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:25,674
I don't know.
He went with you, didn't he?

657
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,572
Yes.

658
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:29,077
Of course.

659
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:35,216
Come on.

660
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,478
God, what a sensation!

661
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,172
Of what?

662
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:09,012
Do you ever feel
you've lived something before?

663
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:11,019
Yes.

664
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:13,521
Why is that?

665
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:15,989
They say it's a lapse
in the brain.

666
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,258
I've been here before.

667
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:24,098
It usually goes away
after a few seconds.

668
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:28,335
I don't want it to go away.

669
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:43,683
You've made use of your time.

670
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:47,347
That's all there is here.

671
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:52,922
Very pretty. Is it Sofia?

672
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:05,401
How much longer will I be here?

673
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:07,635
No one ever knows that.

674
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,611
Even my worst nightmare
was never like this place.

675
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:14,480
It's a psychiatric penitentiary.
No more, no less.

676
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:20,988
- I shouldn't be here.
- You're accused of murder.

677
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:24,026
- I don't even know what I did.
- Tell me something.

678
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:29,326
-Does the name Eli mean anything to you?
-Eli?

679
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,663
You know a girl with that name?

680
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,498
No. Why do you ask?

681
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,506
It seems you kept
repeating it last night.

682
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,270
I guess I was dreaming.

683
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:43,675
- What did you dream?
- I can't remember.

684
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:48,206
- It could be important.
- How could it be important?

685
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:52,311
Look, I can prove you didn't know
what you were doing...

686
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:55,357
but first I have to find
some explanation for all this.

687
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,861
There is no explanation.
I told you the other day.

688
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,452
What did you dream, César?

689
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,200
I don't know.

690
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:08,734
I only remember bits.

691
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:14,368
First, I'm in a kind of office.

692
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:16,741
A secretary shows me
into another office.

693
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:21,042
There's a photo
of a sunset and a man.

694
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,552
Then, I don't know.

695
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:27,749
- They show me lots of papers.
- What papers?

696
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:29,484
I don't know.

697
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:32,186
But I sign them.

698
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:35,162
Does the office belong
to your company?

699
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:38,199
No, I don't recognize it.

700
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:40,394
You dreamed of a place
you'd never been?

701
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:44,167
Yes. That happens a lot,
doesn't it?

702
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:47,436
Are they the papers
you signed with the doctors?

703
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:51,343
No, what happened with the doctors
was surreal.

704
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:54,939
- Why?
- They rang me to go to the hospital.

705
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:59,844
When I arrived,
the whole surgical team was waiting.

706
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:05,690
For months, those faces had looked at me
with indifference and impotence.

707
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:08,355
Now they were all smiles.

708
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:13,424
The same bastard who had said my case
was hopeless talked about an operation.

709
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:17,769
They had a new revolutionary system
in the clinic now.

710
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:22,436
They said that within two weeks my face
would be completely reconstructed.

711
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:24,445
You didn't believe them?

712
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:30,383
Not at first. I thought it was just
a way to get more money out of me.

713
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:33,922
But they showed me
all the gadgets for the operation.

714
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:37,255
It looked like science fiction.

715
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:41,023
All I could see were cables,
switches, monitors.

716
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:45,464
Actually, I never really knew
what they were going to do.

717
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:47,593
But I thought I'd nothing to lose.

718
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:50,639
Those people
were used to rhinoplasties...

719
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:55,007
liposuctions, hair transplants,
but my operation was much more.

720
01:01:55,111 --> 01:01:57,341
In less than a week...

721
01:01:57,447 --> 01:02:00,348
my life had turned around.

722
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:05,149
One night, I was lying
on the ground drunk, waiting to die.

723
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:07,518
The net morning,
my dreams were coming true...

724
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:09,955
like in the movies.

725
01:02:10,026 --> 01:02:14,019
Sofia loved me, and the doctors
found the miracle cure.

726
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:17,861
I don't know.
Obviously, I was suspicious.

727
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:19,696
Suspicious?

728
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:23,169
Of whom? Of what?

729
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,173
I don't know.

730
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:28,366
In life, you never know.

731
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:31,003
Happiness comes
when you least expect it.

732
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:36,550
I once knew a guy
who was alone in the world.

733
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:39,485
Suddenly, he was married
with two daughters.

734
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:43,218
Fuck, you've got
a strange idea of happiness.

735
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:56,004
Well, that depends on the individual.
What's happiness for you?

736
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:58,040
What's happiness for you?

737
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:02,669
Don't ask any more stupid questions.

738
01:03:02,745 --> 01:03:06,146
But at that time, you were happy.
Or weren't you?

739
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:09,582
So what?
My life now is shit.

740
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:14,145
All I can do is eat, shit, sleep
and dream of my memories.

741
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:17,722
It's good that you remember.

742
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:36,176
- Well?
- Well, what?

743
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:40,511
They were to remove
the plates today.

744
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:43,585
- And they did.
- And?

745
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:47,384
Well, my ears are where
they should be.

746
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:49,686
César, don't scare me.

747
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:55,292
- Take off the plates.
- You can do it.

748
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:16,607
How did they do it?

749
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:58,713
Wait.Just to say
that I love you.

750
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:03,050
You're going too fast...

751
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:06,390
considering we met yesterday.

752
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:07,587
Yesterday?

753
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:10,632
My birthday, don't you remember?

754
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:16,064
I met an incredible girl.
Her name was Sofia.

755
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:19,767
But today I woke up feeling great...

756
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:22,400
and now I'm with the girl again.

757
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:29,315
What is it?

758
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:33,152
What is it?

759
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:37,452
If you want me to move,
you have to put in a coin.

760
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:43,798
Ting!

761
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:55,533
We never appreciate the good moments
till they're over.

762
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:57,737
Maybe that's why
they're good moments.

763
01:06:57,813 --> 01:07:01,112
- We don't stop to think about them.
- Perhaps.

764
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:03,117
What happened to Pelayo?

765
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,779
- What's up?
- Hang on a minute.

766
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:08,589
- That's it.
- About time.

767
01:07:08,657 --> 01:07:12,058
- Want anything else?
- No, thanks.

768
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:17,731
How's things, Pelayo?

769
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:19,460
Fine.

770
01:07:19,568 --> 01:07:21,729
How's things, Pelayo?

771
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:24,328
Fine.

772
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,704
Yeah.

773
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:30,743
I'm actually not as fucked up
as I look.

774
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:33,610
I'm used to you always winning,
you bastard.

775
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:36,674
- And Sofia isn't that great.
- You said she was ideal.

776
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:38,481
Really?

777
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:42,080
I was drunk.

778
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:44,216
Anyway, we're friends.

779
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:57,870
Bastard!

780
01:07:57,973 --> 01:08:01,101
- What's that on your face?
- What?

781
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:07,445
- Fuck, there's a seam opening!
- What are you on about?

782
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:15,622
You fucking idiot!

783
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:17,743
What's the matter?

784
01:09:20,456 --> 01:09:22,356
I hate dreaming.

785
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:13,565
You're tickling me.

786
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:45,941
What's wrong?

787
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:49,209
What is it?

788
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:53,046
- Where's Sofia?
- What?

789
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:57,745
What have you done with Sofia?

790
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:00,787
- I am Sofia.
- You bitch!

791
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:08,852
- You're mad. You're mad.
- Where is she?

792
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:33,380
In one minute,
I'm going to call the police.

793
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:36,913
You'll be in trouble
if Sofia doesn't appear.

794
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:39,551
So you survived the accident.

795
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:41,493
What accident?

796
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:45,089
- Whose body was it?
- I didn't have an accident.

797
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:48,431
No. It wasn't an accident.
It was attempted murder.

798
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:50,664
A pity you didn't see my face, bitch!

799
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:55,005
- Why do this? How have I changed?
- You haven't.

800
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:58,045
You're the same lunatic
who gate-crashed my party.

801
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:02,174
I'm the girl you made love to just now.
I'm Sofia.

802
01:12:02,284 --> 01:12:05,845
Stop saying you're Sofia,
do you hear?

803
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:09,082
Don't say her name!

804
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,990
You won't tell me where she is.

805
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:16,825
You never will.

806
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:22,501
César.

807
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:26,607
I love you.

808
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:32,647
- Hello.
- Hello.

809
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:39,450
You can go. I'll see to this.

810
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:43,620
Right.

811
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:46,024
Let me get this clear.

812
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:52,058
- Where were you last night?
- At home. I told that gentleman.

813
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:54,135
At home. With whom?

814
01:12:54,236 --> 01:12:57,603
- With a girl.
- The girl just questioned?

815
01:12:57,673 --> 01:13:00,437
No, that's another girl.
I was with Sofia.

816
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:02,409
The girl I spoke to was Sofia.

817
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:04,809
Yes, that's what she says,
but it's a lie.

818
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,646
- Who is she then?
- She's Nuria.

819
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:10,048
Nuria what?

820
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:15,121
I don't know.
She never told me her surname.

821
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:17,624
Let's see.

822
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:21,493
You were at home with a girl
called Sofia, and suddenly--

823
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:24,430
I go to the bathroom, come back,
and she's in Sofia's place.

824
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:25,761
Where's Sofia?

825
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:27,733
Ask Nuria.
She's pretending to be her.

826
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:32,503
You don't know her surname?

827
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:34,599
But who do you believe, her or me?

828
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:38,908
Listen, that girl's papers
are all in order. We've let her go.

829
01:13:40,382 --> 01:13:44,512
- You've what?
- And I assure you she's called Sofia.

830
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:48,022
Sofia Cueto, and she lives
at number 2, Quiròs St.

831
01:13:48,123 --> 01:13:50,455
- No!
- No, what?

832
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:54,791
Well, yes, but that's another girl.
I know the real Sofia.

833
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:57,195
Then tell me where she is.

834
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:02,063
Because, legally the girl
you're talking about...

835
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:05,106
only exists in your imagination.

836
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:10,476
- I don't believe this.
- And another thing.

837
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:14,048
The girl looks as if she'd been hit.

838
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,311
She was in my house
supplanting my girlfriend!

839
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:20,479
I don't know why,
but she wouldn't press charges.

840
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:24,425
Fucking great!
So now she's the victim!

841
01:14:24,526 --> 01:14:26,858
Tell me.
Are you on drugs?

842
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:30,558
- God!
- You were under psychiatric care.

843
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:33,533
My face was destroyed
in a car crash she caused!

844
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:35,331
Your face looks fine.

845
01:14:35,437 --> 01:14:37,268
Because--

846
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:40,239
It doesn't matter.
I've got nothing more to say.

847
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:41,901
Young man.

848
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:45,105
I'd advise you to see a psychiatrist.

849
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:54,245
Are you an idiot?

850
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:56,847
- What the fuck is this?
- What do you mean?

851
01:14:56,959 --> 01:15:01,487
If you wanted to fuck her up,
there are other ways to do it!

852
01:15:02,631 --> 01:15:05,532
- Keep away from Sofia!
- It isn't Sofia. It's Nuria!

853
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:06,931
Nuria's dead!

854
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:10,096
Calm down, or you'll be sleeping
in a cell tonight!

855
01:15:10,205 --> 01:15:12,435
Don't ever talk to me again!

856
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,966
I don't know what the cops told you,
but Nuria is alive!

857
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:18,137
The cops didn't tell me,
Sofia did.

858
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:20,772
Listen, you spoke to her by phone,
didn't you?

859
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:23,283
- Let go!
- It wasn't Sofia.

860
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,583
Nuria can imitate her voice.
She took her ID, her apartment.

861
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:30,785
It wasn't over the phone.
I've just dropped her home.

862
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:32,793
She looked like this.

863
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:41,969
Nice photo, isn't it?

864
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,095
You going to say that isn't Sofia?

865
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:47,300
But that's--
Is this a joke or what?

866
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,241
You're crazy, man.

867
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:53,310
I'm crazy? I'm crazy?

868
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:58,282
You're the ones who are mad!
You're all mad!

869
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:00,321
Let go of me!

870
01:16:01,523 --> 01:16:03,423
God, what's happening?

871
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:06,426
It's my partners, right?

872
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:08,758
They've paid you.
This is a plot!

873
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:12,766
Look at yourself. You haven't
been right since the accident.

874
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:15,603
Fuck you!

875
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:19,500
Are you saying--

876
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:23,806
Are you saying this is the girl
you ran after the other night?

877
01:16:23,879 --> 01:16:26,177
- Is this your ideal girl?
- Yes!

878
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:29,581
And you took her.

879
01:16:37,826 --> 01:16:39,885
You need a psychiatrist!

880
01:16:47,235 --> 01:16:48,725
Problems?

881
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:52,205
I'm in no mood, so just--

882
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:54,867
There's an explanation for all this.

883
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:56,376
César.

884
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:00,847
Who are you?

885
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:03,783
- You've seen me on TV.
- What do you want?

886
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:07,851
I'm here to help you.

887
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:11,552
First of all, it's very important
that you calm down.

888
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:12,888
Calm down?

889
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:16,522
You must overcome your fears
and regain control.

890
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:19,567
What control do you mean?
I'm fine.

891
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,364
Who says you aren't?

892
01:17:21,436 --> 01:17:24,166
They do. All of them.

893
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:26,331
They think I'm mad.

894
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:28,409
No, of course you're not mad.

895
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:33,073
But what if I told you
you were dreaming?

896
01:17:37,786 --> 01:17:39,253
No, no, no.

897
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:41,186
Why not?

898
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:44,747
- I know what's real, and this is real.
- How do you know?

899
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:47,420
You discover your dreams
when you wake.

900
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:49,258
I just know.

901
01:17:49,364 --> 01:17:53,027
- My dreams are much simpler than this.
- No dream is simple.

902
01:17:53,135 --> 01:17:55,933
Look at those people.

903
01:17:56,038 --> 01:17:59,303
They seem to be talking
about their own business.

904
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:01,808
Completely unaware of you.

905
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:05,903
And yet, they could be there
because you wanted it.

906
01:18:05,981 --> 01:18:10,782
What's more, you could have them
at your complete service...

907
01:18:10,886 --> 01:18:13,047
or have them destroy you.

908
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:15,282
I want them to be quiet.

909
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:17,290
And you, too.

910
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:33,239
See?

911
01:18:44,352 --> 01:18:46,252
What's going on here?

912
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:52,151
Someone tell me the fucking truth!

913
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:55,991
The truth?
Maybe you couldn't take it.

914
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:03,265
It had to be a setup,
a big joke to drive me crazy.

915
01:19:03,371 --> 01:19:06,033
They all knew. Nuria, Pelayo,
the police, the guy at the bar.

916
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:08,268
- Who was he?
- I don't know.

917
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:10,776
You said you saw him on TV.
On what program?

918
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:12,403
I don't know!

919
01:19:13,548 --> 01:19:16,813
I don't know. One that talked
about freezing the dead.

920
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:19,649
- Freezing the dead?
- Cryonization.

921
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:21,848
Like they did to Walt Disney.

922
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:29,962
Maybe I can help you remember.

923
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:31,760
Is that a threat?

924
01:19:35,403 --> 01:19:37,030
Lie down.

925
01:19:42,477 --> 01:19:43,876
What's that?

926
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:45,446
A syringe.

927
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:50,377
Relax.

928
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:52,079
My arm's stinging.

929
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:54,678
It's a tranquilizer.

930
01:19:54,756 --> 01:19:56,451
What for?

931
01:20:05,433 --> 01:20:07,901
These things are all bullshit.

932
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:11,905
If you'd trusted psychiatrists more,
you mightn't be here now.

933
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:18,039
That finger,
it's making me nervous.

934
01:20:18,113 --> 01:20:20,081
You needn't be afraid.

935
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:22,776
- I'm not afraid.
- Stop talking and concentrate.

936
01:20:22,884 --> 01:20:25,079
Come on.

937
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:26,586
Fuck.

938
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:29,915
I feel dizzy.

939
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:31,481
Good-bye, César.

940
01:20:35,897 --> 01:20:39,594
Very good. Now let's see
if you can tell me about that dream.

941
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:45,102
- In my dream, it isn't raining.
- The office dream.

942
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:46,265
Eli.

943
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:48,774
That's it. I want you
to tell me who Eli is.

944
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:51,472
-A secretary.
- Eli is a secretary?

945
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:54,310
She tells me to go in.
They're epecting me.

946
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:56,281
Who's epecting you?

947
01:20:57,719 --> 01:21:00,711
- The Frenchman from the TV.
- Sit down, please.

948
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:02,949
It's a contract.

949
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:05,015
- Eli--
- César, who is Eli?

950
01:21:07,162 --> 01:21:10,290
You won't regret it.
Sign.

951
01:21:10,398 --> 01:21:14,266
- What are you signing?
- Eli will see to everything.

952
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:16,896
What have you signed?

953
01:21:20,842 --> 01:21:22,241
What's wrong?

954
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:24,244
What's wrong, César?

955
01:21:24,346 --> 01:21:26,246
Why are you crying?

956
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:29,249
- I'm going to die.
- You're not going to die.

957
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:33,618
- I don't know how many.
- How many what?

958
01:21:33,688 --> 01:21:36,816
- Pills.
- You took pills?

959
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:40,419
- How many should I take?
- Pills to feel better?

960
01:21:40,528 --> 01:21:42,086
I don't want to.

961
01:21:42,197 --> 01:21:45,257
When I count to three,
you'll wake up. One. Two.

962
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:53,669
I thought that, up to now,
you'd told me the truth.

963
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:57,210
What do you mean?

964
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:59,212
You said you took nothing.

965
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:02,683
César, I'll ask you
for the last time.

966
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:05,685
- Did you take drugs?
- Fuck! Why does everyone--

967
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:08,450
Stop playacting.
Tell me the truth!

968
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:11,354
- I must know what you took.
- I didn't take anything!

969
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:15,726
Don't you see? Your brain
could have been affected by the pills.

970
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:18,025
- I didn't take any!
- You said you did!

971
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:20,397
It's just a dream!

972
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:22,527
Why make it more important
than it is?

973
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:25,903
Can't you tell dreams from reality?
I can!

974
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:29,340
Really? Don't make me laugh!

975
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:32,346
Bodies that come to life,
people who disappear...

976
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:34,439
you, the Phantom of the Opera!

977
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:42,420
Tell me one thing. Do you remember
what you did to Sofia?

978
01:22:45,593 --> 01:22:47,026
It wasn't Sofia.

979
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:51,259
I don't care who it was.
What did you do to her?

980
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:54,231
You remember?

981
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:32,499
My God!

982
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:39,096
What are you doing?
I thought you were a burglar.

983
01:24:42,043 --> 01:24:43,670
Who are you?

984
01:24:43,778 --> 01:24:45,336
I'm Sofia.

985
01:24:46,214 --> 01:24:48,114
Sofia.

986
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:52,913
You're not Sofia.

987
01:24:57,759 --> 01:25:00,227
César, this will all
be over soon.

988
01:25:00,328 --> 01:25:02,228
We'll be together again.

989
01:25:03,565 --> 01:25:06,534
You'll forget Nuria
and I won't be afraid of you.

990
01:25:10,071 --> 01:25:13,199
- I'm thirsty.
- I'll get some water.

991
01:25:53,882 --> 01:25:55,144
Sofia!

992
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:59,419
Yes, César, I'm Sofia.

993
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:05,286
I'm Sofia.

994
01:27:39,554 --> 01:27:42,114
I want to see you.

995
01:27:42,223 --> 01:27:45,351
I want to see you.
I want to see you!

996
01:27:50,231 --> 01:27:52,096
I want to see you!

997
01:29:35,103 --> 01:29:37,571
At times you dream
you're with someone.

998
01:29:37,772 --> 01:29:40,400
For example, your father.

999
01:29:40,508 --> 01:29:43,306
In seconds,
he becomes your mother...

1000
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:47,280
and then, the news vendor
on the corner.

1001
01:29:47,348 --> 01:29:51,341
Yet you still feel as if
you're talking to the same person.

1002
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:57,489
You thought you were at home, but
suddenly you realize you're in a school.

1003
01:29:57,558 --> 01:30:01,016
Or a hospital, or a prison.

1004
01:30:02,797 --> 01:30:05,265
Dreams are like that.

1005
01:30:05,366 --> 01:30:08,199
And at times the mind behaves
as if it were in a dream.

1006
01:30:08,302 --> 01:30:11,066
- You know what derangement is?
- For fuck's sake!

1007
01:30:11,205 --> 01:30:14,606
Say I'm stupid if you want,
but this isn't derangement!

1008
01:30:14,709 --> 01:30:16,700
Then what is it?

1009
01:30:16,811 --> 01:30:19,405
You tell me,
because I don't know.

1010
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:23,517
I don't know what's in here,
or why you killed your girlfriend.

1011
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:26,678
I don't know who Eli is,
or that man from the TV.

1012
01:30:26,788 --> 01:30:30,121
- I don't know anything.
- That makes two of us.

1013
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:44,670
Will you still come
after the trial?

1014
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:46,798
Don't you hate the sight of me?

1015
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:52,738
- What will you plead?
- Why do you ask that?

1016
01:30:52,847 --> 01:30:55,782
The first hearing
is next week.

1017
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:01,583
Temporary derangement.

1018
01:31:01,689 --> 01:31:04,487
It's your best chance.

1019
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:06,583
Even so, it won't be much use.

1020
01:31:06,694 --> 01:31:09,185
They won't believe me.

1021
01:31:09,263 --> 01:31:11,197
Even I don't believe it.

1022
01:31:11,265 --> 01:31:12,664
What do you believe?

1023
01:31:14,268 --> 01:31:18,500
I think you're very sick
and should stay here for a long time.

1024
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:22,905
Don't worry.
I'll get at least 20 years.

1025
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:26,071
César, you may not believe it,
but I care about you.

1026
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:28,672
I care a lot about you.

1027
01:31:30,685 --> 01:31:32,243
Look, kid.

1028
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:35,915
Your case interests me.
I'm sorry about what's happened.

1029
01:31:36,023 --> 01:31:39,424
I even thought someone
was playing tricks on you, but...

1030
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:41,962
I can't and mustn't
exceed my duties.

1031
01:31:42,063 --> 01:31:45,089
- I'm just a psychiatrist.
- You don't look like one.

1032
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:47,759
- What do I look like?
- My father.

1033
01:31:47,869 --> 01:31:49,894
Preaching at me all day.

1034
01:31:49,971 --> 01:31:52,804
Your father's dead.

1035
01:31:52,907 --> 01:31:54,499
There you go.

1036
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:06,714
By the way, what happened to that man
with the wife and two daughters?

1037
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:12,959
I don't know.
I never saw him again.

1038
01:32:13,027 --> 01:32:14,961
Take my advice, get a lawyer.

1039
01:32:15,029 --> 01:32:17,156
Good-bye, César.

1040
01:32:20,334 --> 01:32:21,961
Good-bye.

1041
01:32:22,036 --> 01:32:26,029
...the main Spanish investment,
but certainly the most novel.

1042
01:32:41,455 --> 01:32:43,946
...its economic presence in Cuba.

1043
01:32:44,025 --> 01:32:47,483
...depending on the era.

1044
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:51,521
In the Roman Empire, for eample,
the normal thing was to live...

1045
01:32:51,632 --> 01:32:53,600
only 25 years.

1046
01:33:00,141 --> 01:33:02,166
Who's got the remote?

1047
01:33:03,778 --> 01:33:05,837
Give it to me!

1048
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:14,778
Get it off him!

1049
01:33:30,771 --> 01:33:32,636
What's up?

1050
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:35,368
There's a computer here
connected to Internet.

1051
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:38,344
They'll only let me use it
if you come with me.

1052
01:33:38,412 --> 01:33:41,870
- Why do you want Internet?
- I know what Eli is.

1053
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:43,382
Wait!

1054
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:46,352
Eli isn't a person,
it's a company.

1055
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:48,752
- How do you know?
- It isn't Eli.

1056
01:33:48,856 --> 01:33:51,882
It's L.E. They're the initials
of an American company.

1057
01:33:51,993 --> 01:33:55,520
- What are you doing?
- Checking the ''initials program.''

1058
01:33:55,596 --> 01:33:58,224
It'll tell us all it knows
about L.E.

1059
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:04,263
Shit!

1060
01:34:04,372 --> 01:34:07,466
- It'll take ages.
- No, wait.

1061
01:34:13,347 --> 01:34:15,042
Fuck!

1062
01:34:15,116 --> 01:34:17,380
I feel like
I've done this before.

1063
01:34:17,451 --> 01:34:20,113
A cerebral dysfunction.
A lapse in the brain.

1064
01:34:20,221 --> 01:34:22,712
No, not this time.

1065
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:24,223
My God!

1066
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:26,589
- That's it.
- The photo in your dream?

1067
01:34:26,694 --> 01:34:29,754
I had to see it before
I could dream about it, right?

1068
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:31,092
''Cyronics.''

1069
01:34:31,165 --> 01:34:33,224
- Cryonization.
- I'll print this.

1070
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:37,430
Wait a minute. I don't see
what this has to do with your case.

1071
01:34:37,538 --> 01:34:40,939
The key is in here.
Look, there's an office in Madrid.

1072
01:34:41,008 --> 01:34:43,408
I'll go and check it out.

1073
01:34:43,477 --> 01:34:45,945
No! I have to go, too.

1074
01:34:46,013 --> 01:34:49,642
- I can't get you out of here.
- I'd be let out under supervision.

1075
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:51,445
Make up some excuse.

1076
01:34:51,552 --> 01:34:53,281
- It isn't easy.
- You can do it.

1077
01:34:53,354 --> 01:34:55,948
You know something else,
don't you?

1078
01:34:58,826 --> 01:35:00,259
I don't know anything.

1079
01:35:00,327 --> 01:35:03,125
- I've just got a feeling.
- What is it?

1080
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:05,994
I have to go there,
one way or another.

1081
01:35:50,044 --> 01:35:54,208
Let's get things straight.
We're outside, I'm armed.

1082
01:35:54,315 --> 01:35:56,875
My job is to stop you
doing anything stupid.

1083
01:35:56,984 --> 01:35:59,248
Try anything,
and you get a bullet.

1084
01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:35,517
I've been here before.

1085
01:36:35,589 --> 01:36:37,887
- This way.
- Move.

1086
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,065
You've got 20 minutes.

1087
01:37:05,619 --> 01:37:07,985
It's just like in my dream.

1088
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:14,150
Good morning.
Can I help you?

1089
01:37:15,129 --> 01:37:18,860
Well, actually, we wanted
to speak to Mr. Duvernois.

1090
01:37:20,801 --> 01:37:22,666
He's my son.

1091
01:37:24,972 --> 01:37:26,803
He's very shy.

1092
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:31,440
Mr. Duvernois isn't here
right now.

1093
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:34,948
But, first of all, do you know
what cryonization is?

1094
01:37:35,049 --> 01:37:36,778
Well, more or less.

1095
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:40,810
Here are some leaflets.
You can read them while you're waiting.

1096
01:37:40,921 --> 01:37:43,788
One of my colleagues
will be with you soon.

1097
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:44,950
Thank you.

1098
01:37:45,025 --> 01:37:49,052
''Live without limits.
Tomorrow is for the foresighted.''

1099
01:37:49,163 --> 01:37:51,063
What is this?
Some kind of sect?

1100
01:37:51,165 --> 01:37:55,602
''Cryonization is the biostasis
or preservation of human beings.

1101
01:37:55,669 --> 01:37:59,070
It is the bridge to carry
our patients to a future...

1102
01:37:59,173 --> 01:38:02,199
when technology
will restore them to life.''

1103
01:38:05,946 --> 01:38:08,176
You pay to live eternally.

1104
01:38:11,185 --> 01:38:12,948
They laughed at Jules Verne.

1105
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:16,683
César, all this
is absolutely impossible.

1106
01:38:16,790 --> 01:38:18,758
What do you know
of the future?

1107
01:38:18,859 --> 01:38:22,488
They promise what the Church
has always promised.

1108
01:38:22,563 --> 01:38:24,963
Immortality.
Except they're quacks, not priests.

1109
01:38:25,032 --> 01:38:27,091
How are you involved?

1110
01:38:27,201 --> 01:38:29,635
You're not cryonized.
You're alive.

1111
01:38:29,703 --> 01:38:32,604
This is the contract,
if you want to look at it.

1112
01:38:34,141 --> 01:38:36,939
The procedure is very simple.
You could die at any time.

1113
01:38:37,044 --> 01:38:39,877
Today, tomorrow, in 20 years.
It doesn't matter to us.

1114
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:43,541
At the very moment
you're declared legally dead...

1115
01:38:43,651 --> 01:38:47,553
Life Extension transfers your body
to our store in Arizona.

1116
01:38:47,655 --> 01:38:50,146
There, it's frozen
at minus 7 8 degrees.

1117
01:38:50,224 --> 01:38:54,058
We call that ''total suspension,''
and it costs $240,000.

1118
01:38:54,161 --> 01:38:57,494
30,000 pays for the freezing process,
and the rest...

1119
01:38:57,564 --> 01:38:59,623
goes into
an investment fund...

1120
01:38:59,733 --> 01:39:02,395
the interests from which
pay for maintenance...

1121
01:39:02,503 --> 01:39:05,631
and resurrection costs,
the day that it's possible.

1122
01:39:05,739 --> 01:39:07,536
If it is possible.

1123
01:39:07,608 --> 01:39:11,840
We believe that the reanimation
of the dead will be possible.

1124
01:39:11,912 --> 01:39:13,903
- What's this?
- What?

1125
01:39:14,014 --> 01:39:16,414
Clause 1 4.
Artificial perception.

1126
01:39:16,517 --> 01:39:20,977
It's a concept that we haven't
fully developed yet.

1127
01:39:21,088 --> 01:39:23,750
Look. This is a life.

1128
01:39:23,857 --> 01:39:25,757
Birth and death.

1129
01:39:25,859 --> 01:39:28,885
Let's say you've got
a terminal illness.

1130
01:39:28,996 --> 01:39:32,830
Of course you want to go on living,
but not in the future.

1131
01:39:32,933 --> 01:39:37,233
That doesn't interest you.
You want to live your life now.

1132
01:39:37,304 --> 01:39:40,535
Very well.
You die, we freeze you...

1133
01:39:40,607 --> 01:39:45,067
and when we can resuscitate you,
we'll have you live...

1134
01:39:45,846 --> 01:39:47,108
a dream.

1135
01:39:48,615 --> 01:39:51,277
- A dream?
- It will all look real.

1136
01:39:51,385 --> 01:39:53,580
Your family and friends,
your city...

1137
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:55,588
the world, even this office.

1138
01:39:55,689 --> 01:39:57,623
But it'll be a virtual reality.

1139
01:39:57,725 --> 01:40:01,422
What's more, we'll make you forget
that you've died...

1140
01:40:01,495 --> 01:40:03,429
and that you signed
this contract.

1141
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:05,294
- How?
- Very simple.

1142
01:40:05,399 --> 01:40:07,424
Wiping it from your memory.

1143
01:40:07,501 --> 01:40:10,368
You'll live your life linearly,
as if nothing had happened.

1144
01:40:10,471 --> 01:40:14,237
And best of all, you'll live it
as you like, as you wish.

1145
01:40:14,308 --> 01:40:16,776
You'll decide at all times.

1146
01:40:16,844 --> 01:40:20,780
But what if there were mistakes?

1147
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:24,443
What if the dream
was transformed into a nightmare?

1148
01:40:24,551 --> 01:40:27,577
Well, the subconscious
can always play a dirty trick.

1149
01:40:27,654 --> 01:40:31,215
But we're not cowboys.
This is a serious company.

1150
01:40:31,325 --> 01:40:35,659
And virtual reality technology
is constantly making huge advances.

1151
01:40:35,763 --> 01:40:37,788
Look.

1152
01:40:37,898 --> 01:40:39,627
I'll be honest.

1153
01:40:40,768 --> 01:40:43,794
Signing Clause 1 4
is like signing for paradise.

1154
01:40:44,905 --> 01:40:50,502
It's hard to believe.
But they laughed at Jules Verne.

1155
01:40:55,349 --> 01:40:56,407
Excuse me.

1156
01:41:01,422 --> 01:41:04,255
- Where are you going so fast?
- To the bathroom.

1157
01:41:04,358 --> 01:41:06,986
- Well, not so fast.
- I'll go with him.

1158
01:41:07,094 --> 01:41:09,528
He just felt ill, don't worry.

1159
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:17,537
César, calm down, please.

1160
01:41:17,638 --> 01:41:20,004
This is a dream.
It's the only explanation.

1161
01:41:20,107 --> 01:41:22,098
What he said is impossible.

1162
01:41:22,209 --> 01:41:24,541
In the 20th century,
but maybe not in the 30th.

1163
01:41:24,645 --> 01:41:28,046
- Maybe not, but we're in 1 99 7.
- That's what it seems.

1164
01:41:28,148 --> 01:41:31,117
- I paid for it to seem like that.
- Listen! If this is a dream--

1165
01:41:31,218 --> 01:41:35,382
Look at me! If this is a dream,
it means that I don't exist!

1166
01:41:35,489 --> 01:41:37,821
- I just imagine you.
- No!

1167
01:41:37,891 --> 01:41:41,349
- César, I'm real.
- How do I know that?

1168
01:41:41,428 --> 01:41:45,387
Can't you tell a dream from reality?
Is this a dream, eh?

1169
01:41:45,499 --> 01:41:47,865
Tell me, is this a dream?

1170
01:41:50,471 --> 01:41:53,031
César, I'm wearing myself out
over this case.

1171
01:41:53,107 --> 01:41:56,702
There is no case. I didn't kill anyone.
It's all a nightmare.

1172
01:41:56,777 --> 01:42:00,372
Fuck it, César, trust me!
This isn't a dream.

1173
01:42:00,481 --> 01:42:02,381
- They got it wrong.
- Who?

1174
01:42:02,483 --> 01:42:07,352
I don't know! But they mixed up Sofia
and Nuria! I see a face that isn't mine.

1175
01:42:07,421 --> 01:42:10,254
I'm sick of hearing that!
Your face is fine.

1176
01:42:10,357 --> 01:42:13,815
You're behaving like a child,
hiding behind that mask.

1177
01:42:13,927 --> 01:42:16,862
- Go on, take it off!
- I don't want to see myself!

1178
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:19,398
I don't care about that.
I want to see you.

1179
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:23,698
Don't you realize? All that matters
is what I see! It's my dream!

1180
01:42:23,770 --> 01:42:28,400
Say that once more and
I'll have you locked up in an asylum.

1181
01:42:28,509 --> 01:42:32,411
Show me your face.
Now. You owe it to me.

1182
01:42:52,533 --> 01:42:57,630
César, look in the mirror and tell me
if you think you're disfigured.

1183
01:43:02,309 --> 01:43:03,367
God!

1184
01:43:03,477 --> 01:43:05,877
Why do you keep seeing
what isn't there?

1185
01:43:05,979 --> 01:43:08,140
- You look fine.
- I'm a monster!

1186
01:43:08,248 --> 01:43:11,775
What do you mean?
Anybody'd like to have your face.

1187
01:43:11,885 --> 01:43:13,614
You look normal.

1188
01:43:13,687 --> 01:43:16,451
Not just normal.
You're handsome!

1189
01:43:17,658 --> 01:43:21,594
César, listen. Maybe you've got
something like anorexia.

1190
01:43:21,662 --> 01:43:25,098
Some girls insist they're fat
and end up crazy.

1191
01:43:25,165 --> 01:43:26,223
César!

1192
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:30,295
I want to wake up!

1193
01:43:30,404 --> 01:43:33,066
I want to wake up!

1194
01:43:33,173 --> 01:43:36,040
- Hold it!
- I want to wake up!

1195
01:43:36,176 --> 01:43:37,541
Fuck!

1196
01:43:38,445 --> 01:43:39,639
Shit!

1197
01:43:39,746 --> 01:43:42,374
- Freeze!
- Don't shoot!

1198
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:46,849
This is a nightmare!
It's a nightmare!

1199
01:43:58,732 --> 01:44:02,793
You! Wait a minute!
You're not to leave!

1200
01:44:02,869 --> 01:44:04,336
Stop!

1201
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:15,940
Wait a minute!

1202
01:44:31,565 --> 01:44:32,998
It's a dream!

1203
01:44:33,066 --> 01:44:35,364
It's a dream!

1204
01:44:52,019 --> 01:44:56,979
Don't move!
Drop the gun!

1205
01:44:59,359 --> 01:45:02,522
- I want to wake up. I want to wake up.
- Don't move!

1206
01:45:02,596 --> 01:45:06,088
I want to wake up!

1207
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:18,573
Antonio.

1208
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:21,913
Antonio!

1209
01:45:23,283 --> 01:45:25,183
What?

1210
01:45:25,285 --> 01:45:27,412
You're crushing me.

1211
01:45:28,689 --> 01:45:32,750
I'd better not move.
I've been shot in the back.

1212
01:45:33,994 --> 01:45:36,121
How do you know?

1213
01:45:37,297 --> 01:45:39,891
Well...

1214
01:45:39,966 --> 01:45:41,365
because--

1215
01:45:55,182 --> 01:45:57,946
What's going on here?

1216
01:45:58,018 --> 01:46:00,111
What the fuck's going on?

1217
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:02,017
I told you, it's a dream.

1218
01:46:02,155 --> 01:46:04,385
Shut up! Shut up!

1219
01:46:06,393 --> 01:46:10,489
I know what this is.
It's one of those Candid Camera jokes.

1220
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:14,425
You did a great job, I loved it,
but enough's enough!

1221
01:46:14,501 --> 01:46:16,969
- I see someone.
- Where?

1222
01:46:17,070 --> 01:46:19,129
Up there, on the roof.

1223
01:46:19,239 --> 01:46:21,503
I can't see a thing.

1224
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:24,640
Where are you going?

1225
01:46:26,947 --> 01:46:31,475
Come on, Antonio. Don't think
about it anymore or you'll go crazy.

1226
01:46:47,701 --> 01:46:49,328
Hello, César.

1227
01:46:51,204 --> 01:46:53,195
It's time I introduced myself.

1228
01:46:53,306 --> 01:46:56,969
My name is Serge Duvernois.
I represent Life Extension.

1229
01:46:57,043 --> 01:46:58,442
We met...

1230
01:46:59,646 --> 01:47:01,045
1 50 years ago.

1231
01:47:01,148 --> 01:47:03,844
What? Has the world gone mad?

1232
01:47:03,950 --> 01:47:07,647
There's no world.
It's all in that gentleman's mind.

1233
01:47:07,721 --> 01:47:09,655
Including you and me.

1234
01:47:09,723 --> 01:47:12,521
Sure! Shall I thump you
to see if it hurts?

1235
01:47:12,626 --> 01:47:17,723
Try it. They can make you disappear
right now, like everyone else.

1236
01:47:17,831 --> 01:47:20,698
- And who are ''they,'' may I ask?
- The company.

1237
01:47:20,801 --> 01:47:23,133
Life Extension.

1238
01:47:23,236 --> 01:47:25,636
They know everything
we're saying.

1239
01:47:25,739 --> 01:47:31,405
They know what is going through César's
mind an instant after he thinks it.

1240
01:47:31,511 --> 01:47:35,038
If they can make me disappear,
why haven't they done it?

1241
01:47:35,148 --> 01:47:37,139
It would be virtually incorrect.

1242
01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:39,377
You've just saved his life.

1243
01:47:39,486 --> 01:47:43,047
Virtually incorrect?
Do you think I'm an idiot or what?

1244
01:47:43,156 --> 01:47:46,683
No, quite the opposite.
You're a great guy.

1245
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:49,593
A character who is
very necessary for César.

1246
01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:52,393
A character?

1247
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:55,500
- Where are you going?
- To look for someone.

1248
01:47:55,602 --> 01:47:59,129
There is no one.
People aren't necessary now.

1249
01:48:06,947 --> 01:48:08,972
Why didn't you wake me before?

1250
01:48:10,116 --> 01:48:13,677
You only had to ask.
But that was difficult.

1251
01:48:13,787 --> 01:48:17,746
Because, in theory,
you wouldn't know you were dreaming.

1252
01:48:17,858 --> 01:48:19,587
Since when?

1253
01:48:19,693 --> 01:48:21,752
Remember the day
of the discotheque?

1254
01:48:21,862 --> 01:48:25,696
That night, when you fell asleep
on the sidewalk...

1255
01:48:25,799 --> 01:48:28,267
was the one chosen
for the splice.

1256
01:48:28,368 --> 01:48:29,960
What splice?

1257
01:48:30,070 --> 01:48:33,562
The splice between your real life
and your virtual life.

1258
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:37,235
A splice of 1 50 years
which you didn't notice...

1259
01:48:37,310 --> 01:48:40,711
because you were dead
and frozen.

1260
01:48:40,814 --> 01:48:42,805
From when you woke up...

1261
01:48:42,916 --> 01:48:45,111
nothing was real.

1262
01:48:45,218 --> 01:48:48,346
We wiped what really happened
from your memory.

1263
01:48:49,656 --> 01:48:52,250
What was it?

1264
01:48:52,325 --> 01:48:54,793
You never saw Sofia again.

1265
01:48:54,895 --> 01:48:58,194
And the doctors were never able
to rebuild your face.

1266
01:48:59,366 --> 01:49:03,632
You woke up on that street
with an awful hangover.

1267
01:49:03,737 --> 01:49:06,069
You shut yourself away
for months.

1268
01:49:06,172 --> 01:49:08,163
One day you learned
that we eisted.

1269
01:49:09,209 --> 01:49:12,667
You came to the office,
you signed the contract...

1270
01:49:12,779 --> 01:49:15,009
and then...

1271
01:49:15,115 --> 01:49:17,083
you killed yourself.

1272
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:20,383
I paid for this?

1273
01:49:21,421 --> 01:49:24,948
I paid for Nuria
to come back as Sofia?

1274
01:49:25,025 --> 01:49:27,289
I paid to look like
a monster again?

1275
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:29,328
I paid to live this nightmare?

1276
01:49:29,429 --> 01:49:32,159
You paid to live
whatever you wanted.

1277
01:49:32,232 --> 01:49:34,496
We just provided the setting
and the characters.

1278
01:49:34,601 --> 01:49:37,001
You invented your hell.

1279
01:49:37,103 --> 01:49:39,799
I tried to warn you
in that bar.

1280
01:49:39,873 --> 01:49:42,000
I said it all depended
on your mind.

1281
01:49:42,909 --> 01:49:45,844
Do I just have to want it?

1282
01:49:45,946 --> 01:49:48,574
- Can Antonio come--
- There's no one here.

1283
01:49:49,482 --> 01:49:52,679
They can't have made
4 million people disappear!

1284
01:49:53,954 --> 01:49:56,013
You've overcome your fears.

1285
01:49:56,122 --> 01:49:58,181
If you want,
we can try again...

1286
01:49:58,291 --> 01:50:00,452
have you live
a wonderful dream...

1287
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:04,291
with money, friends, Sofia,
or whatever girl you want.

1288
01:50:04,397 --> 01:50:06,865
You just have to ask.

1289
01:50:08,735 --> 01:50:10,669
I don't want more dreams.

1290
01:50:10,737 --> 01:50:12,796
It isn't a dream!

1291
01:50:12,906 --> 01:50:14,806
César, listen to me.

1292
01:50:14,908 --> 01:50:17,399
This is real.
This man is a sham.

1293
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:20,035
Let's go down
and look for people.

1294
01:50:20,113 --> 01:50:22,843
Ignore him. It's logical
for him to behave like this...

1295
01:50:22,916 --> 01:50:25,407
but he doesn't
feel anything.

1296
01:50:25,518 --> 01:50:27,748
I don't feel anything?

1297
01:50:27,854 --> 01:50:31,381
I don't feel anything?
What do you know about what I feel?

1298
01:50:31,491 --> 01:50:33,186
Ignore him, he isn't real.

1299
01:50:33,259 --> 01:50:35,921
Yes, I am real!

1300
01:50:36,029 --> 01:50:38,259
I've got a wife
and two daughters.

1301
01:50:38,365 --> 01:50:42,324
His personality is designed
so that he'll say all this now.

1302
01:50:42,435 --> 01:50:45,404
Where are my daughters?
God!

1303
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:48,532
César, we can offer you
another possibility.

1304
01:50:48,608 --> 01:50:51,839
In 1 99 7, it was impossible
to rebuild your face.

1305
01:50:51,945 --> 01:50:55,574
But out there,
it's the year 2 1 45.

1306
01:50:55,682 --> 01:50:59,015
You wouldn't believe
the things surgery can do.

1307
01:50:59,119 --> 01:51:01,451
You could wake up...

1308
01:51:01,554 --> 01:51:04,387
and live in the future
like a normal person.

1309
01:51:04,457 --> 01:51:07,620
- In the future?
- You have to choose.

1310
01:51:10,630 --> 01:51:12,564
How could I wake up?

1311
01:51:12,632 --> 01:51:16,830
How would you wake
from your worst nightmare?

1312
01:51:22,976 --> 01:51:24,910
No, César, don't listen to him!

1313
01:51:24,978 --> 01:51:28,277
Your partners set this up!
They want you to kill yourself!

1314
01:51:28,348 --> 01:51:31,840
He's done that.
Now it'll just be a formality.

1315
01:51:33,219 --> 01:51:35,710
- I'm going to do it.
- Very well.

1316
01:51:37,057 --> 01:51:41,221
Do you have any wish
before you die?

1317
01:51:55,508 --> 01:51:58,170
Let them out there read my mind.

1318
01:53:02,242 --> 01:53:03,641
Who are you?

1319
01:53:04,945 --> 01:53:06,535
I don't know.

1320
01:53:06,645 --> 01:53:10,140
Don't keep suffering.
It's all in your head.

1321
01:53:10,250 --> 01:53:12,720
It's all psychological.

1322
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:40,780
Come on, César.

1323
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:57,860
- What will happen to them?
- Don't prolong this farewell.

1324
01:53:57,965 --> 01:54:01,455
You think they're your friends,
but they're just images.

1325
01:54:01,570 --> 01:54:03,590
That man isn't really crying.

1326
01:54:27,090 --> 01:54:31,120
- I forgot, I get vertigo.
- Then don't look.

1327
01:54:33,330 --> 01:54:34,855
Good-bye, César.

1328
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:19,875
Relax.

1329
01:55:22,150 --> 01:55:23,550
Relax.

1330
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:28,090
Open your eyes.
