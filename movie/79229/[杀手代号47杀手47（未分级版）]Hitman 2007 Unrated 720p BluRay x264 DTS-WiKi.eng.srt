One, my men will  accompany you to the hospital...

and, when you and your associate  are able to travel...

they will escort you to the airport.

We know Udre's been planning something  with a German arms dealer named Price.

The two have never met.  That's your way in.

Some.

Unless you pay me.

It's not polite to stare.

So, when are you  gonna tell me your name?

- Get dressed.  - What for?

We're going to dinner.  We need to buy you a new dress.

It's every appearance  Belicoff has made within the last 12 months.

513
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:18,438
This is from the speech he made  in London on May the 7 th.

514
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:23,274
And this is from some shitty political luncheon  he had in northern Georgia.

Someone took a photo  from a mobile phone.

00:54:31,654 --> 00:54:34,282
but unless he's fiigured out  how to be in two places at once-

00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:37,359
- Ha. He has a double.  - He's certainly paranoid enough.
