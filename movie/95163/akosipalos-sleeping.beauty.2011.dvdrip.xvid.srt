1
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:36,094
- Hey.
- Hi.

2
00:01:39,414 --> 00:01:41,702
- Your autograph, please.
- Sure.

3
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,511
Thank you.

4
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:14,939
Thanks for this.

5
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:38,238
Good. That's it.

6
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:44,844
Good.

7
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:07,075
I'm pushing the air in now,
just a little.

8
00:03:07,131 --> 00:03:09,785
So... the pressure in the chest
will change.

9
00:03:30,951 --> 00:03:32,814
You're doing a great job.

10
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:28,070
Do you need a ride, Lucy?

11
00:04:28,658 --> 00:04:29,960
No, thanks.

12
00:04:29,976 --> 00:04:31,733
Think I might do the dry cleaners'.

13
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:35,133
- Take care.
- I am right here.

14
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:37,054
See you.

15
00:04:37,993 --> 00:04:39,244
See you.

16
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,786
Can I interest you in a line?

17
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,012
Yeah, why not?

18
00:05:53,912 --> 00:05:55,261
Thanks.

19
00:05:56,611 --> 00:05:58,034
My pleasure.

20
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:04,836
- This is Lucy.
- Hi.

21
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,276
Hi, Lucy.

22
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,092
Lucy in the sky.

23
00:06:10,972 --> 00:06:13,870
We were just talking about which
one of us is gonna fuck you.

24
00:06:14,902 --> 00:06:16,005
Really?

25
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:21,893
Why don't you toss for it then?

26
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,580
You in?

27
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:32,159
Heads or tails?

28
00:06:34,704 --> 00:06:35,843
Head.

29
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:42,799
Cunt.

30
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:44,745
Head it is.

31
00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:48,208
Yes, my prince.
Did I say when?

32
00:06:49,235 --> 00:06:50,706
Did I say tonight?

33
00:06:51,803 --> 00:06:53,958
This year, next year.

34
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,968
Fair enough.
We'll toss.

35
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,439
Tonight or next year.

36
00:07:00,818 --> 00:07:02,410
Tonight...

37
00:07:03,324 --> 00:07:04,549
...head.

38
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:10,202
- Tonight.
- It's my lucky night.

39
00:07:11,504 --> 00:07:13,927
Now, or in 5 hours?

40
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:17,674
OK, now.

41
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:20,759
Tails.

42
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:27,153
Tails never fails.

43
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:34,072
Let's go then, shall we?

44
00:07:39,448 --> 00:07:40,691
Bye.

45
00:07:54,463 --> 00:07:56,095
- Morning.
- Morning.

46
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:03,037
Have you got the rent?

47
00:08:06,436 --> 00:08:07,697
The rent?

48
00:08:09,397 --> 00:08:11,055
The rent.

49
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:17,231
As in the rent. The rent
is due, the rent is overdue.

50
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:21,690
Here's some. Won't kill them to wait.

51
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:24,145
You have no idea, do you?
It's her house.

52
00:08:27,198 --> 00:08:28,640
Is it your house?
f

53
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:33,803
It's her parent's house. It's no
virtue on being born.

54
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:36,090
Just pay the fucking rent.

55
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:39,025
And while you're at it,
clean the fucking bathroom.

56
00:08:39,376 --> 00:08:40,843
As we all agreed, it's your turn.

57
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:43,342
- I did clean the bathroom.
- You have to grout.

58
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:46,907
Grout.
58f

59
00:08:48,563 --> 00:08:50,733
In between the tiles,
the black stuff.

60
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:56,163
It will give me
great pleasure to grout.

61
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:06,358
Lucy.

62
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:16,857
Telephone.
It's your mother.

63
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,397
- Line 3.
- Thank you.

64
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,715
Hi, mom.

65
00:10:34,971 --> 00:10:36,684
How did you get this number?

66
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,260
No.

67
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,119
Do you want me to lose this job?

68
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,427
OK, yes. I've got it in my hand.

69
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:55,501
It's VISA.

70
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:58,140
5464...

71
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,060
6870...

72
00:11:03,994 --> 00:11:05,837
1390.

73
00:11:08,054 --> 00:11:10,201
The expiry is 04/15.

74
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:17,075
Sorry?

75
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:21,510
Yeah, I can see it.
It's 399.

76
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:28,584
I have to go now, mom.

77
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,561
I have to go.
OK, bye.

78
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:45,143

79
00:11:57,397 --> 00:11:59,638
- Hello, Lucy.
- Hello, Birdmann.

80
00:12:00,482 --> 00:12:02,453
- Come in.
- I bare gifts.

81
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:15,705
Thanks.

82
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,028
- So, how are you?
- I'm very well, thank you. And you?

83
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:24,222
Oh yes, very well. Thank you.

84
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,882
- How's the family?
- Very well, thank you. And yours?

85
00:12:28,352 --> 00:12:30,170
- Oh yes, very well.
- And how are the kids?

86
00:12:31,144 --> 00:12:33,126
Yes, they're fantastic.

87
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:36,212
That's great.

88
00:12:41,357 --> 00:12:42,606
It's good to see you.

89
00:12:44,915 --> 00:12:46,688
You look beautiful.

90
00:12:47,322 --> 00:12:48,694
Thank you.

91
00:13:05,858 --> 00:13:07,507
I have something important to tell you.

92
00:13:11,173 --> 00:13:14,711
Do you remember that time...
on the beach.

93
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,221
After we'd been to Andy's place,
that moment.

94
00:13:21,871 --> 00:13:23,537
I wanted to kiss you.

95
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:27,819
You must have wanted me to kiss you.

96
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:32,794
I couldn't because of my tongue.

97
00:13:35,468 --> 00:13:37,275
My tongue was furred.

98
00:13:38,847 --> 00:13:40,548
Furred and thick.

99
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,739
Putrid.

100
00:13:44,185 --> 00:13:47,024
The asshole, of the asshole,
of the asshole.

101
00:13:53,512 --> 00:13:55,130
I couldn't kiss you.

102
00:13:57,793 --> 00:13:59,589
That's OK.

103
00:14:02,123 --> 00:14:04,105
I wanted you to know.

104
00:14:06,674 --> 00:14:09,055
I just want to love my friends.

105
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:16,811
I know.

106
00:14:19,598 --> 00:14:22,102
It's not an unreasonable request.

107
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:30,161
I'm so fucking tired...

108
00:14:31,499 --> 00:14:33,528
of watching Oprah.

109
00:15:09,557 --> 00:15:12,480
Hi. I'm Melissa. I'm calling about the ad
in the student paper.

110
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:19,871
Slim.

111
00:15:22,162 --> 00:15:23,571
Pert.

112
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:31,172
What should I wear?

113
00:15:33,672 --> 00:15:36,170
OK great. I look forward to seeing you.

114
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,879
Goodbye.

115
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,779
Are you sure you don't want
a cup of tea or coffee?

116
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:46,695
- Water?
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.

117
00:16:55,575 --> 00:16:56,983
Yes, I think we're ready.

118
00:16:59,048 --> 00:17:00,408
Yes.

119
00:17:13,923 --> 00:17:15,566
- Hello.
- Hi.

120
00:17:16,164 --> 00:17:17,689
Please, come in.

121
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:20,775
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

122
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,702
Thank you for coming.

123
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,008
Such a pleasure to see
such a unique beauty.

124
00:17:32,823 --> 00:17:34,559
Let me tell you how things
should proceed.

125
00:17:35,427 --> 00:17:37,562
I'll describe the job and then
if you're interested...

126
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:40,038
we'll discuss particulars,
how does that sound?

127
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:42,379
Yes. Good.

128
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:46,543
We're looking for Silver service waitress
to work at private functions...

129
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,725
in lingerie that we will supply.

130
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,849
You will be working with
other girls...

131
00:17:51,388 --> 00:17:53,957
...some of whom will have
more responsibilities.

132
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:57,335
There is room for promotion.

133
00:17:58,356 --> 00:18:00,702
The pay is $250/hour cash.

134
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,764
You'll be engaged on a freelance basis.

135
00:18:05,136 --> 00:18:06,627
Job by job.

136
00:18:07,389 --> 00:18:09,607
Either one of us can terminate our
arrangement at any time...

137
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:13,137
so please be sure to maintain another
more reliable source of income.

138
00:18:14,322 --> 00:18:15,824
I understand.

139
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:21,402
We rely on mutual trust.
And discretion.

140
00:18:22,641 --> 00:18:25,516
And I'm obliged to tell you they're
heavy penalties...

141
00:18:27,517 --> 00:18:30,337
...very heavy penalties
for any breaches of discretion.

142
00:18:34,202 --> 00:18:36,946
- Am I clear?
- Yes.

143
00:18:38,543 --> 00:18:42,895
My sincere advice to you is to
use the money wisely.

144
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:48,467
Think of it as a windfall,
pay off a student loan.

145
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,944
Please, please do not think
of this as a career.

146
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:56,155
Just work hard for a short
amount of time.

147
00:18:58,243 --> 00:19:00,295
Your vagina will not be penetrated.

148
00:19:01,728 --> 00:19:05,435
- Your vagina will be a temple.
- My vagina...

149
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,849
...is not a temple.

150
00:19:10,773 --> 00:19:13,976
While that's quite true my darling,
you won?t ever be penetrated.

151
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:19,208
Now. Will you stand up
for me please and strip.

152
00:19:29,954 --> 00:19:31,385
Thomas?

153
00:19:43,504 --> 00:19:45,145
Open your mouth, darling.

154
00:19:55,013 --> 00:19:56,573
Not pierced?

155
00:20:01,606 --> 00:20:03,154
Do you have any tattoos?

156
00:20:05,243 --> 00:20:06,497
Good.

157
00:20:07,953 --> 00:20:09,830
Stand your feet apart a few inches.

158
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,407
What's this?

159
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,575
I had a mole removed.

160
00:20:45,364 --> 00:20:46,984
Please, get dressed.

161
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:52,674
I have some questions that
I need to ask you.

162
00:20:54,749 --> 00:20:55,898
Are you on any medication?

163
00:20:56,803 --> 00:20:58,093
Just the pill.

164
00:20:59,818 --> 00:21:00,968
Anything else?

165
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:04,170
- No allergies? Antidepressants?
- No.

166
00:21:04,252 --> 00:21:06,941
- Prozac? Effexor?
- No.

167
00:21:08,386 --> 00:21:09,700
Are you a smoker?

168
00:21:10,732 --> 00:21:11,741
No.

169
00:21:12,597 --> 00:21:14,334
Maybe the occasional...

170
00:21:15,554 --> 00:21:18,345
...jazz cigarette.
Very rarely.

171
00:21:19,753 --> 00:21:22,405
Other drugs? Anything at all toxic?

172
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,409
No, never.

173
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:27,379
Why not?

174
00:21:27,813 --> 00:21:31,709
Throughout history humankind has used drugs.
Drugs are a form of...

175
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,359
...grace.

176
00:21:35,404 --> 00:21:37,324
Aspirin for the soul.

177
00:21:38,641 --> 00:21:41,046
My mother is an alcoholic
with a violent temper.

178
00:21:42,336 --> 00:21:44,191
She runs an astrology hotline.

179
00:21:50,984 --> 00:21:54,350
We have a doctor that we'd
like you to see. For blood tests.

180
00:21:55,246 --> 00:21:57,886
- Will that be a problem?
- No, that's fine.

181
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,147
You called us on a public telephone.
You have mobile?

182
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,611
- Yes.
- Good.

183
00:22:04,174 --> 00:22:06,543
We'll cover all your expenses,
all your work-related expenses.

184
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:08,996
Now.

185
00:22:10,286 --> 00:22:11,776
Silver service.

186
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:15,436
- Are you familiar with Silver service?
- Yes.

187
00:22:18,018 --> 00:22:20,235
From what side does one serve the fish?

188
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,508
- Right side.
- Left side.

189
00:22:25,936 --> 00:22:28,036
Thomas, take note.
Thomas is going to help you.

190
00:22:30,606 --> 00:22:33,363
You are very beautiful.
Very talented.

191
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:36,167
But we're going to make you
even more beautiful.

192
00:22:36,846 --> 00:22:39,369
Even more talented.
Come.

193
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:45,122
And your name...

194
00:22:46,295 --> 00:22:48,066
We'd like to call you Sara.

195
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:52,983
OK. Thank you.

196
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,031
Fuck!

197
00:23:59,942 --> 00:24:01,877
- You all right, darling?
- Yeah.

198
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:09,374
- Would you like a lavender tissue?
- Sure.

199
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:19,019
I'm sorry.

200
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,079
Fuck.

201
00:24:31,826 --> 00:24:33,867
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

202
00:24:35,087 --> 00:24:37,680
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you. And how are you?

203
00:24:38,255 --> 00:24:39,628
Oh yes, fine. Thank you.

204
00:24:40,322 --> 00:24:41,894
OK sit down at the table.

205
00:24:42,621 --> 00:24:44,663
To what do I owe this
extraordinary pleasure?

206
00:24:45,754 --> 00:24:47,103
Nothing special.

207
00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:50,986
Just upgrading my skill set.

208
00:24:53,996 --> 00:24:55,479
Nothing special?

209
00:25:00,137 --> 00:25:01,709
White or white?

210
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:19,540
Can we watch some porn?

211
00:25:21,848 --> 00:25:23,095
No.

212
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:32,950
What have you done
to your fingers?

213
00:26:07,771 --> 00:26:09,049
Sara?

214
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,720
Hi, Sara.
I'm Sophie.

215
00:26:50,702 --> 00:26:53,376
- You look lovely.
- Thanks.

216
00:26:54,557 --> 00:26:58,709
OK. Now, I need you to go into the
dressing room for me and fix your make up.

217
00:26:59,354 --> 00:27:01,313
You'll find a lipstick palette in there
and I want you to match...

218
00:27:02,475 --> 00:27:03,836
...an exact match...

219
00:27:04,516 --> 00:27:06,886
...match your lipstick to the
color of your labia.

220
00:27:10,511 --> 00:27:11,754
You're kidding me.

221
00:28:33,727 --> 00:28:35,053
It's not a game.

222
00:29:55,229 --> 00:29:57,693
You're OK? Good.

223
00:30:00,075 --> 00:30:01,096
Ready?

224
00:30:02,562 --> 00:30:03,934
Let's go.

225
00:30:45,381 --> 00:30:47,599
Thank you friends for coming
here tonight.

226
00:30:48,526 --> 00:30:51,316
As ever, it is wonderful to see you.

227
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:53,723
Thank you.

228
00:30:57,852 --> 00:31:01,242
This evening we're serving
Beluga caviar with toasted brioche.

229
00:31:28,729 --> 00:31:30,173
Service.

230
00:31:36,038 --> 00:31:38,437
Galantine of quail
stuffed with black truffle...

231
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,837
on the nest of fried leek
and herbs.

232
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,346
Curious choice.

233
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,595
I first tried that dish
many years ago.

234
00:31:48,404 --> 00:31:51,301
On the occasion of my 20th
wedding anniversary.

235
00:31:52,135 --> 00:31:54,586
But tonight, I've asked my chef
to do what he can...

236
00:31:55,325 --> 00:31:56,956
...to bring it back to life.

237
00:31:58,235 --> 00:32:01,579
Perhaps you'll be able to tell me
whether it really does taste so good.

238
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:07,667
Or if it is the memories of Elizabeth
and that night that make it so special.

239
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,706
To the dish itself.

240
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,401
To the dish.

241
00:32:16,231 --> 00:32:17,791
To memories.

242
00:32:51,992 --> 00:32:54,304
- Brandy?
- Thank you.

243
00:33:00,087 --> 00:33:01,671
Such fair skin.

244
00:33:03,197 --> 00:33:04,451
Brandy?

245
00:33:22,165 --> 00:33:23,644
Thank you.

246
00:33:45,641 --> 00:33:46,966
Not to worry.

247
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,922
Upsy daisy.

248
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,794
No harm done.

249
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,016
Sorry.

250
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:09,667
Don't worry.
You did really well.

251
00:34:17,128 --> 00:34:18,888
Leave those for the cleaners.

252
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,947
We won't be needing you
anymore tonight.

253
00:34:26,032 --> 00:34:27,487
Thanks.

254
00:37:43,193 --> 00:37:45,211
- You look lovely.
- Yeah, you too.

255
00:37:45,586 --> 00:37:47,393
Your hair looks great.

256
00:37:56,259 --> 00:37:57,925
Can I leave early tonight?

257
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:00,707
- Just this once.
- Thank you.

258
00:38:25,684 --> 00:38:27,738
It gets a bit easier.

259
00:38:28,546 --> 00:38:29,932
It's never easy, though.

260
00:38:32,547 --> 00:38:34,037
How long have you been
doing it for?

261
00:38:36,618 --> 00:38:38,683
What kind of a question
is that?

262
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:44,466
I'm sorry.

263
00:39:03,318 --> 00:39:05,102
- Thanks.
- No problem.

264
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:43,763
May I?

265
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,356
Yeah, be my guest.

266
00:39:51,788 --> 00:39:55,941
Some people fake their deaths.
I'm faking my life.

267
00:39:58,512 --> 00:40:00,305
You're doing a good job.

268
00:40:04,622 --> 00:40:06,101
I want to show you something.

269
00:40:22,185 --> 00:40:24,719
I would really love to
suck your cock.

270
00:40:30,456 --> 00:40:32,098
Hallelujah.

271
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:04,694
Hi, Lucy.

272
00:41:07,592 --> 00:41:08,507
What time is it?

273
00:41:09,656 --> 00:41:10,924
It's morning.

274
00:41:24,873 --> 00:41:25,975
Can I get you anything?

275
00:41:26,832 --> 00:41:27,912
Coffee?

276
00:41:29,295 --> 00:41:30,762
Yeah, coffee.
Thanks.

277
00:41:38,822 --> 00:41:39,830
Hey, Birdmann?

278
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:42,399
Will you marry me?

279
00:41:44,687 --> 00:41:45,650
Yes.

280
00:41:47,197 --> 00:41:48,734
Thank you.

281
00:41:49,347 --> 00:41:51,789
- Not at all.
- It's very kind of you.

282
00:41:54,467 --> 00:41:55,752
It's a pleasure.

283
00:42:07,762 --> 00:42:08,946
Thanks.

284
00:42:21,487 --> 00:42:22,878
I'm ready, I think.

285
00:42:26,074 --> 00:42:27,658
I think I'm nearly ready.

286
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,044
We can get you back
into detox.

287
00:42:42,452 --> 00:42:44,289
I could, I'm flush.

288
00:42:46,706 --> 00:42:47,719
Thank you.

289
00:42:51,074 --> 00:42:53,057
I don't think I'd make it
this time.

290
00:42:58,536 --> 00:42:59,779
You could.

291
00:43:04,085 --> 00:43:05,652
Do you believe that?

292
00:43:11,253 --> 00:43:12,961
I don't know.

293
00:43:32,475 --> 00:43:34,083
Sandhill Dunnart.

294
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,461
Nocturnal and endangered.

295
00:43:38,329 --> 00:43:40,218
A marsupial mouse.

296
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,350
Thought to be extinct
until recently.

297
00:43:44,578 --> 00:43:46,600
Its main predators include
owls and bats.

298
00:43:49,087 --> 00:43:51,421
Little is known about the animal
due to its rarity.

299
00:43:53,275 --> 00:43:56,438
First they eat insects but
will also eat meat on occasion.

300
00:43:57,628 --> 00:43:59,388
Sharp, carnivore's teeth.

301
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:03,763
Scared, Sandhill Dunnart will make
a loud noise...

302
00:44:04,514 --> 00:44:06,708
...as it moves into an
offensive position.

303
00:44:10,211 --> 00:44:11,659
What it really is...

304
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,108
...the Sandhill Dunnart...

305
00:44:16,293 --> 00:44:20,446
is a miniature, a more
tenacious kangaroo.

306
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,517
Hi, Thomas.
No time, no hear.

307
00:44:38,923 --> 00:44:41,011
I'd be happy to do what I can,
try me.

308
00:44:43,944 --> 00:44:45,258
Sorry?

309
00:44:50,044 --> 00:44:51,241
For how long?

310
00:44:54,584 --> 00:44:55,852
That's it?

311
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,075
How much?

312
00:45:03,793 --> 00:45:07,267
OK yes.
Yeah, I understand.

313
00:45:07,882 --> 00:45:09,099
OK. Bye.

314
00:45:31,282 --> 00:45:33,031
- Hey.
- Good afternoon.

315
00:47:30,412 --> 00:47:33,040
Come in.
Come through.

316
00:47:33,744 --> 00:47:35,210
Welcome to my home.

317
00:47:35,902 --> 00:47:37,674
I hope the trip wasn't too grueling.

318
00:47:38,213 --> 00:47:40,325
- No, it was fine. Thank you.
- Wonderful.

319
00:47:41,252 --> 00:47:44,255
Perhaps you'd like a shower
to refresh you after your long drive.

320
00:47:45,499 --> 00:47:47,475
There's a bathroom at the end
of the corridor on the right.

321
00:47:47,511 --> 00:47:49,506
You'll find a robe behind the door.

322
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:54,674
Oh, and try not to let your
hair get wet.

323
00:47:55,101 --> 00:47:56,267
Sure.

324
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,433
I'm ready.

325
00:48:15,424 --> 00:48:17,840
- Are you feeling well?
- Pardon?

326
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:21,278
Are you in good health?

327
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:23,613
Yeah, I'm fine.

328
00:49:12,311 --> 00:49:15,115
You're going to sleep
and wake up.

329
00:49:15,654 --> 00:49:17,731
It'd be as if these hours
never existed.

330
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:20,347
You won't even dream.

331
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:24,546
For an hour or two after you wake
you'll feel, yes, slightly...

332
00:49:25,274 --> 00:49:26,928
...groggy, but then fine.

333
00:49:28,148 --> 00:49:29,521
Perfectly fine.

334
00:49:30,143 --> 00:49:31,997
Not nearly as bad as a hangover.

335
00:49:33,016 --> 00:49:34,953
Such a sleep works wonders.

336
00:49:36,137 --> 00:49:37,263
You'll feel...

337
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:40,595
...profoundly restored.

338
00:50:35,064 --> 00:50:36,472
Thank you, Clara.

339
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,871
A few months ago,
a strange thing happened.

340
00:50:47,018 --> 00:50:49,741
I was idling through my bookshelves,
when I noticed a book...

341
00:50:50,421 --> 00:50:52,979
...my brother's once given me
for my birthday.

342
00:50:53,424 --> 00:50:55,160
A collection of short stories.

343
00:50:56,145 --> 00:51:00,276
Well, I started to reread
one of those stories.

344
00:51:02,504 --> 00:51:06,071
It was about a man who one morning
wakes up and cannot...

345
00:51:06,469 --> 00:51:08,487
bring himself to get out of bed.

346
00:51:08,909 --> 00:51:12,582
He shuts his eyes is self defense.

347
00:51:14,401 --> 00:51:18,201
He reexamines his life.
He's seized with a restlessness.

348
00:51:19,057 --> 00:51:21,585
He packs his bags, cuts all ties,

349
00:51:21,586 --> 00:51:23,880
he can no longer live
among the people he knows.

350
00:51:24,197 --> 00:51:26,238
They paralyze him.

351
00:51:26,777 --> 00:51:29,569
He's monied, he goes to Rome.

352
00:51:30,472 --> 00:51:34,567
He wants to burrow under the earth
like a bulb, like a root.

353
00:51:35,189 --> 00:51:39,682
But even in Rome he cannot escape
people from his former life.

354
00:51:40,702 --> 00:51:44,843
So, he decides to return to the city
where he was born and educated...

355
00:51:45,419 --> 00:51:49,337
but which he can't quite
bring himself to call home.

356
00:51:51,436 --> 00:51:54,252
Well, the move doesn't help.

357
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,227
He feels he has no more right
to return than a dead man.

358
00:52:00,165 --> 00:52:04,564
What can he do? He desires an extreme
solution to his conundrum.

359
00:52:05,351 --> 00:52:09,644
He aches for nothing less than
a new world, a new language.

360
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,680
Nothing changes.

361
00:52:15,018 --> 00:52:18,665
Out of indifference, and because he
can't think of anything better to do...

362
00:52:19,757 --> 00:52:23,558
...he decides once more to
leave his hometown, to do some hitching.

363
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:25,977
A man picks him up,
they ride off into the night...

364
00:52:25,978 --> 00:52:28,064
when "bang",
the car smacks into a wall.

365
00:52:28,206 --> 00:52:32,533
The driver dies,
our man is hospitalized, broken up.

366
00:52:35,606 --> 00:52:39,935
Months pass, his wounds heal.

367
00:52:41,308 --> 00:52:44,546
Now he wishes for life.

368
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:49,837
He has a confidence in himself,
in things he doesn't have to explain.

369
00:52:50,306 --> 00:52:55,632
Things like the pores in his skin,
all things corporeal.

370
00:52:56,183 --> 00:53:00,982
He can't wait to get out of the hospital,
away from the infirm and the moribund.

371
00:53:03,117 --> 00:53:08,350
"I say unto thee, rise up and walk.
None of your bones are broken".

372
00:53:10,285 --> 00:53:11,716
The end.

373
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:15,002
When I reread those words...

374
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,027
"Rise up and walk.
None of your bones are broken"...

375
00:53:19,554 --> 00:53:21,758
I felt a tremendous sadness.

376
00:53:22,404 --> 00:53:26,017
Do you know what the opening
line of the story is?

377
00:53:27,542 --> 00:53:33,736
"When a man enters his 30th year
people will not stop calling him young".

378
00:53:35,367 --> 00:53:36,857
30.

379
00:53:37,608 --> 00:53:40,235
I'd been given the book
for my thirtieth birthday.

380
00:53:40,716 --> 00:53:43,954
"The Thirtieth Year"
by Ingeborg Bachmann.

381
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:48,025
So I had heard.

382
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:50,993
I had been told.

383
00:53:51,885 --> 00:53:55,968
I knew all along, even if
I didn't really know.

384
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:01,763
The great true things are unsurprising.

385
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:07,171
But what did I do back then?

386
00:54:08,708 --> 00:54:11,336
I carried on.

387
00:54:13,178 --> 00:54:16,228
I carried on dutifully.

388
00:54:17,649 --> 00:54:21,272
We were the happy couple, Elizabeth and I.
That's how people saw us.

389
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,246
But in truth, I did not cherish my wife.

390
00:54:28,335 --> 00:54:30,435
And I did not cherish my friends.

391
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:35,632
Or even my children.

392
00:54:38,248 --> 00:54:42,817
I just carried on.

393
00:54:45,474 --> 00:54:46,883
I was a success.

394
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,440
I made my way.

395
00:54:49,956 --> 00:54:55,494
But with each step I cringed.
I was on the back foot, the defensive.

396
00:54:58,346 --> 00:55:00,042
And now...

397
00:55:02,524 --> 00:55:07,095
...tonight, for the first time
I say...

398
00:55:08,563 --> 00:55:10,721
...my bones are broken.

399
00:55:12,598 --> 00:55:14,428
Broken.

400
00:55:16,434 --> 00:55:20,529
One day I will need your help.

401
00:55:24,388 --> 00:55:29,714
All of my bones are broken.

402
00:55:37,087 --> 00:55:38,565
You're safe.

403
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:45,780
There's no shame here.
No one can see you.

404
00:55:48,689 --> 00:55:51,528
But our rules must be respected.
No penetration.

405
00:55:52,548 --> 00:55:54,226
Thank you, Clara.

406
00:58:14,801 --> 00:58:15,940
Take care.

407
00:58:16,562 --> 00:58:18,345
You will feel better very soon.

408
00:58:19,495 --> 00:58:20,856
Thanks.

409
00:58:33,397 --> 00:58:35,097
Your instinct was right.

410
00:58:36,411 --> 00:58:38,160
We'll see.

411
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:26,466
You really are a fuckwit.

412
00:59:29,128 --> 00:59:31,001
2 weeks and you're out.

413
00:59:32,465 --> 00:59:33,706
Adios amigo.

414
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,017
Chinga tu madre.
(Fuck your mother)

415
00:59:40,968 --> 00:59:42,599
I'm really sorry.

416
00:59:45,089 --> 00:59:46,672
Me too.

417
01:00:13,291 --> 01:00:14,533
Good morning.

418
01:00:31,956 --> 01:00:33,668
Is this Excelon still available?

419
01:00:34,653 --> 01:00:38,971
That's right. Fantastic place.
Out of the city.

420
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,633
I have keys, I can show you
if you like.

421
01:00:42,876 --> 01:00:44,238
No, it's fine.

422
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:47,687
I'm sure the Excelon
will be excellent.

423
01:00:52,216 --> 01:00:55,061
- It is better to see it, though.
- No, it's OK.

424
01:00:58,191 --> 01:00:59,715
I have a friend in the building.

425
01:01:01,802 --> 01:01:04,301
Well, if that's the case,
then we can definitely do that.

426
01:01:05,383 --> 01:01:06,674
Do you have photo ID?

427
01:01:08,303 --> 01:01:10,263
Some paperwork.
You know how it is.

428
01:01:10,943 --> 01:01:13,172
A stitch in time saves nine.

429
01:02:52,118 --> 01:02:53,760
Hi, Thomas.
This is Sara.

430
01:02:54,241 --> 01:02:56,447
I was just wondering if
Clara is out of her meeting.

431
01:03:00,564 --> 01:03:02,278
Maybe you could give me a hand.

432
01:03:03,381 --> 01:03:06,243
Thing is, I have a new lease.

433
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,410
I was just wondering if there's
any work available.

434
01:03:15,042 --> 01:03:17,411
I'd be really grateful if you
could keep me in mind.

435
01:03:18,865 --> 01:03:20,907
Thanks very much.
Bye, Thomas.

436
01:03:47,503 --> 01:03:49,403
Nearly done.

437
01:04:06,942 --> 01:04:08,384
It's OK.

438
01:04:25,101 --> 01:04:27,061
Here it comes,
it's all right.

439
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:30,548
Sorry.

440
01:04:31,379 --> 01:04:33,244
I have an important call,
I really have to take it.

441
01:04:34,111 --> 01:04:35,952
I'll be back, Dr. Frankenstein.

442
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:39,367
OK. Bad monster.

443
01:04:41,075 --> 01:04:42,251
Look.

444
01:04:42,858 --> 01:04:45,162
It's my bag. I'm coming back, OK?

445
01:05:09,109 --> 01:05:11,513
We have one rule.
No penetration.

446
01:05:14,813 --> 01:05:20,080
Only way I can get a hard on these days
is if I swallow a truck load of Viagra...

447
01:05:20,551 --> 01:05:24,229
...and then some beautiful woman
jams her fingers up my ass.

448
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,213
I'm the one that needs
the penetration.

449
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:34,512
I don't expect that
good fortune tonight.

450
01:05:34,688 --> 01:05:36,800
You're quite right.

451
01:05:38,676 --> 01:05:40,232
Thanks, Clara.

452
01:07:34,385 --> 01:07:36,904
Stretch your cunt, you little bitch.

453
01:08:58,026 --> 01:09:01,177
I'm gonna press your button
and make you all wet.

454
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:05,898
Then I'm gonna fuck you
with my big dick.

455
01:09:09,942 --> 01:09:14,747
I'm gonna fuck you with my
horse's prick and make you fucking scream.

456
01:09:37,531 --> 01:09:39,948
You fucking little bitch.

457
01:09:50,388 --> 01:09:52,997
You fucking little whore.

458
01:10:31,702 --> 01:10:34,201
You fucking little bitch.

459
01:11:34,328 --> 01:11:35,647
Hi.

460
01:11:38,329 --> 01:11:40,559
OK, I'm coming.

461
01:11:47,811 --> 01:11:49,692
Excuse me.

462
01:12:25,481 --> 01:12:27,452
It's OK, I'm here.

463
01:12:28,403 --> 01:12:30,151
Hello, Lucy.

464
01:12:35,899 --> 01:12:38,269
Take your top off.

465
01:15:04,478 --> 01:15:07,762
I love drinking.
I'm really good at it.

466
01:15:09,686 --> 01:15:11,142
When did you last see him?

467
01:15:14,354 --> 01:15:17,108
About 3 or 4 months ago.
Took him out to dinner.

468
01:15:18,185 --> 01:15:20,573
He was wearing your old suit,
I think. The gray one.

469
01:15:24,671 --> 01:15:26,501
I haven't seen the Birdmann in...

470
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:30,455
Well, when was the last time
I saw you?

471
01:15:32,297 --> 01:15:33,633
A year?

472
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,828
They say it was 2 weeks before
his brother found him.

473
01:15:42,233 --> 01:15:44,029
2 weeks in this weather.

474
01:15:47,101 --> 01:15:49,190
Will you marry me?

475
01:15:51,186 --> 01:15:52,580
What?

476
01:15:54,552 --> 01:15:56,253
Why?

477
01:15:57,496 --> 01:15:59,068
I mean...

478
01:15:59,843 --> 01:16:01,543
Why now?

479
01:16:02,376 --> 01:16:04,218
You had your chance.

480
01:16:05,192 --> 01:16:06,682
Go on.

481
01:16:11,081 --> 01:16:12,442
Fuck you.

482
01:16:14,871 --> 01:16:16,607
Fuck you to death.

483
01:16:18,836 --> 01:16:20,584
That's one way to put it.

484
01:16:24,431 --> 01:16:25,957
I'm with Helen now.

485
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,937
I can't believe you.

486
01:16:35,308 --> 01:16:36,820
I don't believe you.

487
01:16:37,899 --> 01:16:39,284
You don't believe you.

488
01:16:40,527 --> 01:16:41,935
Fuck it.

489
01:16:48,728 --> 01:16:50,476
Helen is courteous.

490
01:16:52,518 --> 01:16:54,359
You should try it sometime.

491
01:16:57,011 --> 01:16:58,477
Courtesy.

492
01:17:01,128 --> 01:17:02,958
Courtesy.

493
01:17:21,312 --> 01:17:22,615
You'll be safe here.

494
01:17:23,319 --> 01:17:26,110
There's no shame.
No one can see you.

495
01:17:26,874 --> 01:17:28,492
Thank you, Clara.

496
01:17:29,173 --> 01:17:31,707
I do ask that there?ll
be no penetration.

497
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:35,562
I also ask that you take care
not to leave any marks.

498
01:17:36,857 --> 01:17:38,335
Thank you.

499
01:19:49,204 --> 01:19:51,362
We do fire people here, you know?

500
01:19:54,202 --> 01:19:55,915
Well?

501
01:19:59,012 --> 01:20:00,748
All right, you're fired.

502
01:20:03,211 --> 01:20:04,783
Thank you.

503
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,021
Excuse me?

504
01:20:30,311 --> 01:20:31,731
Hello, excuse me?

505
01:20:33,268 --> 01:20:34,781
Hi. Can I get some help?

506
01:20:37,127 --> 01:20:38,512
What do you think of this one?

507
01:20:40,107 --> 01:20:41,949
Yeah, not bad.

508
01:20:43,157 --> 01:20:44,636
OK, I'll take it then.

509
01:20:45,974 --> 01:20:47,498
Cool. Up here.

510
01:20:59,347 --> 01:21:02,069
OK. Let's get going.

511
01:21:05,165 --> 01:21:09,800
We pick up with black 129,
making a bold move to attack his triangle.

512
01:21:11,102 --> 01:21:13,472
It's an impressive move,
unexpected.

513
01:21:14,457 --> 01:21:17,895
And then, what does the
master do?

514
01:21:18,857 --> 01:21:22,189
He counter attacks, with white
130 to the right.

515
01:21:23,538 --> 01:21:26,290
White 130?
Why did he do that?

516
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:30,049
After 27 long minutes of deliberation...

517
01:21:30,811 --> 01:21:35,187
why did the master play a move,
that would result in his own defeat?

518
01:23:03,286 --> 01:23:04,276
Are you gonna come to the party?

519
01:23:04,783 --> 01:23:06,700
I can't. Have a big day tomorrow.

520
01:23:06,722 --> 01:23:09,079
- How big?
- I'm sleeping.

521
01:23:09,239 --> 01:23:12,670
What?
Live a little. Just a little.

522
01:23:14,795 --> 01:23:16,580
- What is it?
- I don't know.

523
01:23:19,512 --> 01:23:21,565
But it's something good for you.

524
01:23:23,351 --> 01:23:24,602
Why not?

525
01:23:29,496 --> 01:23:32,019
There you go.
Back from the dead.

526
01:23:32,899 --> 01:23:34,999
Fear of death is the number 1 hoax.

527
01:24:41,839 --> 01:24:43,466
Lucy, turn it off.

528
01:24:57,390 --> 01:24:58,563
Hello?

529
01:25:00,592 --> 01:25:04,287
Yeah. In 2 minutes. OK.

530
01:25:08,347 --> 01:25:12,582
You need to get some blinds.
Fucking hell.

531
01:25:51,106 --> 01:25:52,361
Lucy.

532
01:25:53,616 --> 01:25:55,095
Come back inside.

533
01:25:57,405 --> 01:25:59,072
- You're sure?
- She's fine.

534
01:26:43,872 --> 01:26:45,150
Can you pull over?

535
01:26:46,394 --> 01:26:47,836
Pull over!

536
01:27:38,734 --> 01:27:40,178
- Hello, darling.
- Hi.

537
01:27:42,618 --> 01:27:44,870
- Are you well?
- Fine, thank you.

538
01:27:47,182 --> 01:27:49,984
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

539
01:27:52,296 --> 01:27:54,431
A shower always works wonders.

540
01:28:27,019 --> 01:28:28,556
I'd like to ask a favor.

541
01:28:36,815 --> 01:28:40,123
I need to see what goes on in there.
Just once.

542
01:28:45,215 --> 01:28:47,045
I understand. Believe me, I do.

543
01:28:48,887 --> 01:28:50,424
But my clients...

544
01:28:51,844 --> 01:28:56,688
How can I expose them,
to be frank, to blackmail?

545
01:28:57,651 --> 01:28:58,952
Just once.

546
01:28:59,926 --> 01:29:01,921
That's not the way that
we do things.

547
01:29:03,902 --> 01:29:06,003
- Please, Clara.
- I'm sorry.

548
01:29:19,545 --> 01:29:21,364
And I can assume you're quite well?

549
01:29:23,205 --> 01:29:25,082
Perfectly fine, thank you.

550
01:29:26,608 --> 01:29:28,321
And you're in good health?

551
01:29:29,588 --> 01:29:30,960
Yes.

552
01:29:39,090 --> 01:29:40,545
Good girl.

553
01:32:00,117 --> 01:32:01,689
Thank you, Clara.

554
01:32:47,654 --> 01:32:48,991
Are you sure?

555
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:16,102
Thank you.

556
01:33:33,231 --> 01:33:34,498
Goodnight.

557
01:33:35,929 --> 01:33:37,807
Goodnight.

558
01:37:36,923 --> 01:37:40,387
