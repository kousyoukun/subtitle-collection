1
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:41,239
- Green light.
- Let's go.

2
00:02:46,383 --> 00:02:50,581
How many times was John Wayne nominated
for an Academy Award?

3
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:52,655
Probably not enough.

4
00:02:56,192 --> 00:02:58,285
Marcellino's still asleep.

5
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,826
- I'm gonna go relieve Ed.
- How the hell can one son of a bitch
sleep so much?

6
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,404
- Fear.
- As long as he wakes up to testify.

7
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:49,669
Oh, no.

8
00:03:58,888 --> 00:04:01,015
We've been looking for you.

9
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:05,824
- So you want to be a witness?
- No, no, no, no!

10
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:08,159
Witness this.

11
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:18,803
His birthday
was in two weeks.

12
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:22,241
Harry, they wanna
take him out.

13
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,313
Harry?

14
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:35,522
Twenty-seven years of this shit,
and I never got a scratch. Jesus Christ.

15
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:40,528
I want a list of everybody
in Witness Protection...

16
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,530
who knew we
were holding Marcellino...

17
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:44,827
and anybody else
who could've known...

18
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:47,232
from the district attorney
to the commissioner.

19
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,506
They're dead, Mike.

20
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:52,575
Whoever set this up...

21
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,578
whatever it takes...

22
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,305
they're dead.

23
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,816
Okay, Cullen. You're outta here.

24
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:27,737
<i>Now you're off and runnir</i>
<i>Runnirlike you're scared </i>

35
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:17,216

36
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:19,295
<i>Everywhere you go </i>

37
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:44,816
- Whoa!
- Damn!

38
00:08:06,603 --> 00:08:08,867
Aah!

39
00:08:08,972 --> 00:08:12,874
<i> Yes, sir. Well, a number</i>
<i>of the residents have complained...</i>

40
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:17,379

<i>so I think you should do something about it.</i>

41
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,042
Yes, sir. Heh! All right.
Have a good day then.

42
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,416
- You caught the bastard.
- In the act.

43
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:34,155
Bullshit. I was on my way
to a costume party.

44
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:38,257
He stopped somebody over at Route 74
for driving too fast.

45
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:41,098
- He was going to let them off for 50 bucks.
- They stopped me for directions.

46
00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:43,172
Book him.

47
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:47,601
Impersonating an officer,
resisting arrest...

48
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:52,170
fraud, reckless driving
and lying to the sheriff.

49
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,944
- I'll be at home if you need me.
- Okay, Sheriff.

50
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:03,047
Come on, Deputy Dawg.

51
00:09:23,713 --> 00:09:27,205
- <i> </i>
- <i> Amy.! Amy.!</i>

52
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:35,951
Amy?

53
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:38,027
Amy?

54
00:09:42,432 --> 00:09:44,662
- Are we having a party?
- Of course...

55
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:48,897
and I'm glad you're home early
to join in the celebration.

56
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,838
Is it just gonna be us,
or are we gonna have company?

57
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:55,399
Be serious. Of course it's just us.

58
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,071
So, what are we celebrating?

59
00:09:59,248 --> 00:10:01,944
Commemorating...

60
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:05,509
our fifth year.

61
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:10,081
Five years in exile.
Five years in a town without...

62
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:13,492
having found anybody who could talk
about anything except...

63
00:10:13,596 --> 00:10:15,860
crops and the weather.

64
00:10:15,965 --> 00:10:18,798
- It's not gonna be forever.
- The hell it's not.

65
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:23,667
Christ, Amy, this is old news.
Let it go.

66
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:26,936
- I did the best I could.
- The hell you did.

67
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,637
You could still be with the bureau.
You could've fought it.

68
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:33,182
We could still be living in New York.
You did not have to quit!

69
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:35,910
They gave me a chance to resign.
If it would've gone to trial...

70
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:38,680
I would've lost
and they would've kicked me out.

71
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:42,087
I wouldn't have even had
the chance to get this job!

72
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:56,066
What are we having
for dinner?

73
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:58,140
Just this.

74
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:04,875
This is gonna make us fat.

75
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:08,075
You think because we're in shape
we're not already fat?

76
00:11:08,184 --> 00:11:11,176
<i>We're like all the cows</i>
<i>they raise around here.</i>

77
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:15,223
Stuck.
Victims of circumstance.

78
00:11:15,324 --> 00:11:20,193
And you know what a cow's
biggest contribution to this worid is?

79
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:34,935
You should not drink
and bake.

80
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:20,753
<i></i>

81
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,900
Hello, Mark.

82
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,563
- Yeah?
- It's Shannon, Mark. Harry Shannon.

83
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:41,666
It's been a long time, Harry.
What's going on?

84
00:12:41,777 --> 00:12:45,144
I want to talk to you, Mark.
I got trouble.

85
00:12:45,248 --> 00:12:48,843
- Talk.
- No. Not on the telephone.

86
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:51,715
It's all I've got time for.

87
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:54,654
Things aren't so good,
huh, kid?

88
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:56,952
Seen better days.

89
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:00,722
If you wanna see 'em again,
meet me.

90
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:39,099
The bureau always arranges
such intriguing meeting places.

91
00:13:40,469 --> 00:13:43,370
This has nothing to do with the bureau.

92
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:48,136
Mr. Patrovita,
you deny any sources of illicit income...

93
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,576
any connection at all
with organized crime...

94
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,982
yet your reported income
for this past year was $73,000...

95
00:13:56,085 --> 00:14:00,021
with which <i>you</i> somehow
managed to maintain...

96
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:03,091
a seven-bedroom mansion
here in Chicago...

97
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:05,524
<i>a hunting lodge in Wisconsin...</i>

98
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:07,823
<i>a winter resort in California...</i>

99
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,865
four Cadillacs that we know of...

100
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:14,061
and a lifestyle that makes
Ted Turner look like a derelict.

101
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,799
Now, can you explain
how you manage this?

102
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:19,898
I think it'd be of particular interest
to those of us...

103
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:22,375
- on fixed incomes.
- <i> Hold it. That's Baxter.</i>

104
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:25,072
- I know, I know.
- What the hell has he got to do with it?

105
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:28,844
- He's special federal prosecutor.
- That son of a bitch cost me a career.

106
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,216
You brought in a suspect with
half the bones in his body broken.

107
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:35,381
- Any prosecutor would've gone after you.
- Oh, you remember the case.

108
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:38,085
The guy kidnapped
an 11-year-old girl.

109
00:14:38,194 --> 00:14:40,754
He molested, murdered
and mutilated her.

110
00:14:40,863 --> 00:14:45,766
Well, the public wasrt too keen
on heavy-handed cops at that time.

111
00:14:45,868 --> 00:14:48,769
Baxter was out
to nail me to the wall.

112
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:51,806
- I went to see him,
tried to tell him what happened...
- What did he say?

113
00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:55,934
Resign or be prosecuted.
Any way you want it.

114
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:58,309
Yeah, well,
the good news is that...

115
00:14:58,414 --> 00:15:02,441
he's giving Patrovita a lot more shit
than he ever gave you.

116
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:05,111
- <i></i>
- I got a lotta debts.

117
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:09,385
Uh-huh. To whom?

118
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:13,758
- Friends.
- Like Paulo Rocca and Bill Rusman?

119
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:21,295
I plead the Fifth Amendment.

- That's Lu Patrovita.

<i></i>

123
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:36,445

- Mr. Rocca,
your stated source of income...

124
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:40,113
is a travel agency, yet you,
like Mr. Patrovita...

125
00:15:40,222 --> 00:15:44,659
seem to, uh, have a lifestyle
that far exceeds your income.

126
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,490
Would you mind shedding some light
for us on what seems to be...

127
00:15:47,596 --> 00:15:49,996
some extraordinary
money management here?

128
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:53,865
I'll take the Fifth on this,
on whatever you're gonna ask me next...

129
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:55,994
<i>and everything after that.</i>

130
00:15:56,105 --> 00:16:00,201
Honest men don't have to tolerate
this kind of harassment in this country.

131
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:04,302
Thank you, Mr. Rocca,
for reminding us of our inalienable rights.

132
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:06,313
<i></i>
<i>Rocca is the undertaker.</i>

133

<i>this one buries 'em in the gravel pit.</i>

134
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:16,049
So we did <i>Who's Who In Chicago.</i> You're the one
in the bureau. What do you want from me?

135
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:23,824
Do, uh...
Do you remember my son?

136
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:29,303
Blair. Yeah. We went to
some ball games with him.

137
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,738
- Yeah, that's right.
- He joined the bureau, didn't he?

138
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:37,107
Yep.

139
00:16:37,213 --> 00:16:39,181
<i>How is he?</i>

140
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:45,821
Dead.

141
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:54,291
I want Patrovita.

142
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:59,634
- He killed Blair?
- Blair was covering a government aide...

143
00:16:59,735 --> 00:17:02,829
a witness who could've
put the bastard away forever.

144
00:17:03,873 --> 00:17:05,864
No.

145
00:17:05,975 --> 00:17:08,102
No, he had
somebody do it.

146
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:13,910
There's nothing that a small-town sheriff
can do that you can't.

147
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:17,713
Oh, no, no. The bureau
has nothing to do with this.

148
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,653
No, I'm financing
this myself.

149
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:24,317
I have $45,000
in savings.

150
00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:31,689
I want you to get inside the Patrovita
organization and tear it up.

151
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:35,464
Who do you think I look like?
Dirty Harry?

152
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:39,632
- I think you look like an unappy man.
- You have a cure?

153
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:41,903
Possible reinstatement.

154
00:17:42,011 --> 00:17:44,138
Get back into the bureau.

155
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:46,612
- <i>Hmm?</i>
- How?

156
00:17:46,715 --> 00:17:51,015
The bureau's been trying to get somebody
inside of Patrovita's family for over a year...

157
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,317
but there's
a big leak somewhere.

158
00:17:54,423 --> 00:17:56,550
All our guys
keep getting nailed.

159
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:02,495
That's why no one but me
will know about you. Nobody.

160
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:08,400
Now, you do a good job, you pull this off,
and you've got a great shot.

161
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,904
<i>Now, what do you say?</i>

162
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,509
Do you think I'd
still pass the physical?

163
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:05,317
This is Kaminski, investigating a break-in
at the Petrolcam storage yard.

164
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:07,827
Roger, Sheriff. We copy.

165
00:20:27,376 --> 00:20:29,970
I'm sorry you had to kill yourself off, kid...

166
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,946
but it's safer
for everybody that way.

167
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:36,540
<i>The top slot</i>
<i>is Luigi Patrovita.</i>

168
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:40,179
<i>He's been up there for over 20 years.</i>
<i>He's smart.</i>

169
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:43,622
<i>Buried a marching band</i>
<i>getting where he is.</i>

170
00:20:44,893 --> 00:20:47,361
<i>His right arm is</i>
<i>a guy named Rocca.</i>

171
00:20:47,463 --> 00:20:50,728
<i>He'd kill for table scraps.</i>

172
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,926
<i>Him you watch close.</i>

173
00:20:54,103 --> 00:20:57,197
The false I.D. Corresponds
to a guy...

174
00:20:57,306 --> 00:21:00,469
in the N.C.I. Computer
with a bad rap sheet.

175
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:03,136
The phone number
is a safe house...

176
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:06,510
where an answering machine
is set up to catch your bulletins.

177
00:21:06,615 --> 00:21:11,177
There's $25,000 for initial expenses;
more if you need it.

178
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:15,347
The squat-face guy is a new kid on the block.
His name is "Hammer" Lamanski.

179
00:21:15,457 --> 00:21:19,917
He's been biting off
little pieces of Patrovita's pie.

180
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:23,294
<i>Doing damage to him</i>
<i>is probably your quickest way...</i>

181
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:26,061
<i>to catch the big mars eye.</i>

182
00:21:26,168 --> 00:21:29,399
<i>Remember, there's a leak.</i>

183
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:33,032
<i>He's the one</i>
<i>who got Blair killed.</i>

184
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:35,133
<i>He's the one I want.</i>

185
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:37,769
<i>Well, see ya in Chicago.</i>

186
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:44,715
Big player, number eight!

187
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,345
<i>Place your bets. Place your bets.</i>
<i>Place your bets.</i>

188
00:21:49,258 --> 00:21:51,988
Place your bets.
Place your bets.

189
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:58,665
All bets down.
All bets down.

190
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:03,230
Throw the dice!

191
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,468
Seven! You lose.
Come and get another number.

192
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,739
Come and get
another number.

193
00:22:11,847 --> 00:22:14,543
I don't think the table is straight.
I want to see Mr. Lamanski.

194
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:18,347
He's not around, pal. And all losers
don't think a table is straight.

195
00:22:18,454 --> 00:22:20,820
I'm still right.

196
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:28,154
<i> Oh, shit.! Yeah? So what?</i>
<i>Looks like the table's fixed.</i>

197
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:32,757
<i>This table's fixed.! You scumbag.! Hey, look</i>
<i>at that.! That's bullshit.! That's my money.!</i>

198
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:39,430
- Magic or magnet?
- Rudy! Rudy!

199
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:42,442
Hey, you! Get outta here!

200
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:44,705
Scram!
Who the fuck are you?

201
00:23:12,074 --> 00:23:14,565
Hey! Wait up!

202
00:23:41,603 --> 00:23:45,061
Guys, make sure to clean up the mess
before you knock off, okay?

203
00:24:25,747 --> 00:24:27,942
I'm gonna kill
that bastard.

204
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:38,888
Excuse me. Could you move
to the side a little bit?

205
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:42,054
- Your lights.
- Thank you.

209
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,735
It's costing us a lot of money
to get together like this...

210
00:25:30,846 --> 00:25:35,374
because now my time
is won'th as much as yours.

211
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:37,384
- Worth more.
- Hmm?

212
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:40,887
- You got less of it.
- I gave you the courtesy of this talk...

213
00:25:40,989 --> 00:25:43,617
because you worked
for me a long time.

214
00:25:43,725 --> 00:25:47,456
Like I said,
close down everything and get out...

215
00:25:47,562 --> 00:25:49,860
or one morning you
are gonna wake up dead.

216
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:54,163
Luigi, I got employees, obligations...
There's plenty for both of us.

217
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:58,569
There's no "both of us."
There's just me.

218
00:25:58,674 --> 00:26:02,974
- You got two days.
- And then what? Back to work for you?

219
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:07,447
You don't work around here
anymore for me...

220
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:09,779

<i>Auggie, let's move one out.</i>

223
00:26:34,376 --> 00:26:36,503
Get down! Move it!

224
00:26:52,294 --> 00:26:56,788
Fucking Lamanski! Who the hell
does that son of a bitch think he is?

225

- <i>Come on.!</i>

226
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:01,399
That bastard's crazy!

227
00:27:01,503 --> 00:27:04,666
He's a fucking amateur!
He learned nothing from me!

228
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:07,367
- I'm still okay, right?
- Yeah.

229
00:27:07,476 --> 00:27:10,343
<i>Just a waste</i>
<i>of fucking bullets.</i>

230
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:12,879
Tony was a good kid.

231
00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:15,541
Make sure you get
a good replacement for him.

Couple of minutes

Wasted one of his joints

And this stuff
comes from his girlfriend.

What'd you bother
with that for?

Intimidation.
Let him know that nothing is safe.

Joey, this is Max Keller.

Max takes care of things...
all kinds of things.

To take care of things...
all kinds of things.

That job's filled.

277

I'm sure a smart man like Mr. Rocca
is always looking to upgrade.

- I'm the best there is.

The last few years?
Miami.

- Your references?
- I'm in the computer.

I'm sure you can find a couple of cops
that can punch it up for you.

286

What makes you think I'd be happy
to see Lamanski's ass kicked?

287
00:32:32,801 --> 00:32:38,205
You see, in Miami, we can tell everything
by the flow of the blow.

288
00:32:38,306 --> 00:32:42,675
This Lamanski has been making
bigger buys every week.

289
00:32:42,777 --> 00:32:45,268
Now, I know he has been
biting into someone's action.

290
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:52,881
Go see the cashier.

291
00:32:52,987 --> 00:32:56,548
She'll give you a thousand dollars
in chips. Enjoy yourself.

292
00:32:56,658 --> 00:33:00,150
In case you forget,
I'll be checking back with you.

293
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:16,903
I don't believe
a fucking word he said.

294
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:22,672
Girl Scouts build character...

295
00:33:23,985 --> 00:33:26,783
and it's a lot cheaper.

296
00:33:26,888 --> 00:33:29,823
You pester me,
I'll have you tossed out.

297

- They know me.
- I envy them.

299
00:33:35,697 --> 00:33:40,293
- <i>Place your bets.</i>
- I'm sure nobody will mind
if you go home before you're broke.

300
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:45,134
Don't trouble yourself over my money.
I always get more.

301
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,802
Getting it somewhere else
might change your luck.

Where the hell

00:34:37,091 --> 00:34:40,754
If any more guys duck down that alley,
we're gonna start sellir tickets.

306
00:34:44,032 --> 00:34:46,694
- Where'd he go?
- This way.

- Any trouble?
- Oh, nothing special.

312
00:35:48,029 --> 00:35:52,432
- All these alleys probably have rats.
- You got some I.D.?

313
00:35:52,533 --> 00:35:54,433
Sure.

314
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:59,128
Saw those three guys
leave the hotel after ya.

315
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,835
Anything particular
or, uh, just a mugging?

316
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:05,242
They had trouble telling me
what they wanted.

317
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:08,472
Yeah, I'll bet.

318
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:12,041
Joseph P. Brenner.
What's the "P" stand for?

319
00:36:12,153 --> 00:36:14,053
Pussy.

320

The apartment is okay.

323
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:29,803
I'm renting a car tomorrow.

324
00:36:29,904 --> 00:36:33,101
Something happened last night
that got me thinking.

325
00:36:33,207 --> 00:36:36,040
I might get into a spot
where a cop is shooting at me.

326
00:36:36,144 --> 00:36:38,374
Any idea how
I ought to handle it?

327
00:36:38,479 --> 00:36:41,539
Three back-busters jumped me.

328
00:36:41,649 --> 00:36:45,517
I have a feeling that Max Keller
had something to do with it.

329
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:51,354
Rocca is probably checking on me
as I talk. I'll stay in touch.

330
00:37:12,213 --> 00:37:14,147
Hi.

331
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:18,116
When was the last time
you had a good piss?

332
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:39,169
Hey, let me in. I gotta take a leak.

333

340

Patrovita's got
a big fuckir headache.

341
00:38:17,111 --> 00:38:21,480
Call the president.
I think we just fixed the deficit.

342
00:38:23,284 --> 00:38:26,515
That's $100 million
on the street.

343
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:29,954
We can make it up
in a couple of weeks.

344
00:38:35,863 --> 00:38:38,957
Just what
Lamanski needed.

345
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:43,436
If he's got a lot of shit on hand,
he's gonna step in at bargain prices...

346
00:38:43,538 --> 00:38:46,336
and grab a great big chunk
of the business!

347
00:38:46,441 --> 00:38:49,274
Well, why don't we
just take him out?

348
00:38:49,377 --> 00:38:52,369
Because he's
looking for it!

349
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,643
You won't get near him now,
unless you want to start a war.

350
00:38:56,684 --> 00:38:59,084
Nobody needs that.

351
00:39:00,822 --> 00:39:02,722
Later.

352
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,850
- How many got busted?
- <i>Eight.</i>

353
00:39:07,962 --> 00:39:10,692
Nobody pulled a trigger.
They'll all make bail.

354
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:17,702
Have you found
a replacement for Tony?

355
00:39:17,805 --> 00:39:19,773
I'm looking somebody over.

356
00:39:24,212 --> 00:39:27,511
- I want it back.
- What?

357
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,482
The money. The smack.
It's mine. I want it back.

358
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:33,486
Oh, come on! What are we gonna do,
knock over city hall?

359
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:35,920
We don't even know
where they got it stashed.

360
00:39:36,023 --> 00:39:39,254
But we know somebody
who can tell us.

361
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,592
That shit is mine.
I paid for it, and I want it back.

362
00:39:47,101 --> 00:39:49,296
And I'm gonna get it back.

363
00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:55,976
How the hell is it
you never did any time?

364
00:39:56,077 --> 00:39:59,274
I'm smart,
unlike someone we know.

365
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:03,248
Max thinks you stink
from trouble.

366
00:40:03,351 --> 00:40:07,048
- <i>He doesn't want you around.</i>
- I'm sure he makes a lot of mistakes.

367
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:10,488
Never the same one twice.

368
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:13,116
You're on.

369
00:40:14,929 --> 00:40:17,159
But consider yourself temporary.

370
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:28,302
<i>And if Max is right,</i>
<i>very temporary.</i>

371
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,816
We start tomorrow.

372
00:40:37,718 --> 00:40:40,016
It's nice to be
one of the family.

373
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:47,185
- Get my car, please.
- Yes, sir.

374
00:40:49,797 --> 00:40:52,664
Sam, could you
get me a cab, please?

375
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:56,537
<i></i>
<i>Taxi.!</i>

376
00:40:57,605 --> 00:40:59,732
How'd you do
the other night?

377
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,037
- Your money didn't change a thing.
- And tonight?

378
00:41:03,144 --> 00:41:05,442
I got out with cab fare.

379
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,811
Maybe you should try
a different kind of recreation.

380
00:41:11,152 --> 00:41:13,552
Losing at tennis
wouldn't make me feel any better.

381
00:41:13,654 --> 00:41:15,679
The exercise might.

382
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,362
- We don't need you.
- Thanks, pal.

383
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:31,438
Okay. Thank you.

384
00:41:32,607 --> 00:41:35,440
You're a real
take-charge guy.

385
00:41:38,379 --> 00:41:41,974
Hold your glass very still.

386
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,510
Oh!

387
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,180
Huh!

388
00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:53,955
Oh. I don't know why they advertise
all those sleeping pills on television.

389
00:41:54,061 --> 00:41:56,962
I mean, chemicals are
no good for you.

390
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,937
A couple of bottles of champagne
wipes you right out.

391
00:42:04,038 --> 00:42:06,165
Exactly.

392
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:13,338
What are you sayir?
Are you sayir you're ready for bed?

393
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:20,048
- I think so.
- That sounds like a hell of an idea to me.

394
00:42:22,523 --> 00:42:25,617

Ooh!

- Here.
- There you go.

- You know what I like about bedrooms?
- No. What?

401

You almost always
find a bed in there.

- Quite a party.
- Party?

This is just a simple gathering
of the immediate family.

Luigi's parties
have to be held outdoors.

We tried that,

You come home with me,

I'll owe you,
won't I?

528

Not enough to get me
into any trouble.

From what we know,
you don't stay anyplace too long.

533
00:52:11,445 --> 00:52:15,108
If you're not part of an organization
that can protect you...

Give him a little time
to impress us.

If he doesn't, we'll use him for
something dirty and dump him in the pit.

Yes, I think it would accessorize
the outfit beautifully.

What do you think?
Does it make you drool?

551

I would have picked exactly
the same one. That is my taste.

Yeah? Do you like
this one better?

Why don't you just pick one?
I'll never make up my mind.

- Look. We get a floor plan.

We buy ourselves
an inside man and we go.

he told me they're moving it to a federal
depository for safekeeping next Tuesday.

- <i> Okay, lady. Where are you?</i>
- <i></i>

606
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:36,151
<i>Anybody hurt?</i>

607
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:39,232
<i>All right. Someone will be out</i>
<i>over there in a little while.</i>

608
00:59:15,068 --> 00:59:17,036
<i></i>

609
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:27,477
Well, it doesn't look like
they intended too much damage.

610
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:30,549
There's always the chance
the guy was a bad bomb maker.

611
00:59:32,085 --> 00:59:35,521
- What're you doir here, Harry?
- Oh, just hopir that some...

612
00:59:35,622 --> 00:59:38,557
half-assed, pro-life,
whale-lovir terrorist didn't do it...

613
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:42,560
so the bureau doesn't have to get involved,
and we can leave it in your good hands.

614
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,790
- Hmm.
- It's crude. It's very crude.

615
00:59:45,899 --> 00:59:47,867
How are ya, Harry?

616
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:53,704
Hello, Marvin. Yeah, I'm gettir better.
How about yourself?

617
00:59:53,807 --> 00:59:57,971
- Well, complaining doesn't make
any difference, huh?
- Come get a shot of this.

618
00:59:58,078 --> 01:00:00,273
So, what do you figure
this was?

619
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:03,781
Well, he thinks somebody was mad
at the vending machine.

620
01:00:03,883 --> 01:00:06,579
Uh, look, you two kibbutz
somewhere else.

621
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,382
- You're impeding criminal science.
- Yes, yes, right.

622
01:00:09,489 --> 01:00:12,219
So, how goes
your Patrovita case?

623
01:00:12,325 --> 01:00:14,225
I find new angles
every day.

624
01:00:14,327 --> 01:00:17,626
Believe me, he'll run out of options
before we run out of patience.

625
01:00:17,731 --> 01:00:20,393
- I already have.
- Nobody can blame you.

626
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,400
Somebody said
they took you off this case.

627
01:00:22,502 --> 01:00:26,871
Well, they don't control
all the hours of my day.

628
01:00:26,973 --> 01:00:31,535
Don't mess around, Harry. We might have
something workir that you don't know about.

629
01:00:31,644 --> 01:00:36,274
My guess is that whatever
you've got workir... won't work.

630
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:38,283
We're doir all we can.

631
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:40,649
Great. So am I.

632
01:00:40,754 --> 01:00:46,158
I know with you it's personal, but we're
both after the same thing... justice.

633
01:00:47,093 --> 01:00:48,993
Right, Harry?
Justice.

634
01:00:49,095 --> 01:00:51,859
Fuck justice!

635
01:00:54,434 --> 01:00:56,959
- <i> </i>
- Allow me.

636
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,402
There you go.

637
01:00:59,506 --> 01:01:01,406
<i>I don't really</i>
<i>want to lose you </i>

638
01:01:01,508 --> 01:01:03,703
<i>But I don't want to go </i>

639
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:08,979
What's new on
the domestic front?

640
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:12,176
I don't have the report
typed out yet.

641
01:01:12,285 --> 01:01:15,982
<i>I can tell the way they act</i>
<i>and their attitude </i>

642
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:19,957
Remember that horse we used to look at?
I bought it.

643
01:01:20,059 --> 01:01:22,357
What's on your mind, Max?

644
01:01:22,462 --> 01:01:24,362
You.

645
01:01:24,464 --> 01:01:26,955
What can he do for you
I can't?

646
01:01:27,066 --> 01:01:29,660
This was your idea,
not mine.

647
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:32,499
Well, I didn't expect it
to go this far.

648
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:34,630
How far has it gone?

649
01:01:36,075 --> 01:01:38,703
Does he climb into your pants
five times a day?

650
01:01:38,812 --> 01:01:40,712
Is that what you wanna hear?

651
01:01:40,814 --> 01:01:43,977
Not really.
I'd like to know it was me.

652
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:49,385
The only way you'll ever end up lying next
to me is if we're run down by the same car.

653
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,725
I like it when
you hurt me, baby.

654
01:01:53,827 --> 01:01:56,694
Myself...

655
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:59,390
I'd rather give
than receive.

656
01:01:59,499 --> 01:02:01,933
Wrong.

657
01:02:02,035 --> 01:02:05,334
<i>Ever think about</i>
<i>ever settling down </i>

658
01:02:05,438 --> 01:02:07,906
Max...

659
01:02:08,007 --> 01:02:12,341
I don't think we're going to be
the kind of pals I hoped we'd be.

660
01:02:14,614 --> 01:02:16,514
<i>If a tear rolls from my eyes </i>

661
01:02:16,616 --> 01:02:18,641
<i>I feel the hurt inside </i>

662
01:02:18,751 --> 01:02:21,185
<i>As I reach out to you </i>

663
01:02:21,287 --> 01:02:23,778
I'm impressed.

664
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:25,915
I'm hungry.

665
01:02:26,025 --> 01:02:28,289
<i>I can't get out</i>
<i>You see, I'm tied </i>

666
01:02:28,394 --> 01:02:33,525
- <i> </i>
- The more we know each other,
the less you wanna see me.

667
01:02:33,633 --> 01:02:37,262
Is this an approach you developed yourself,
or something you read in a book?

668
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:39,930
These guys from the dress shop
are going to be back...

669
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:42,530
and I don't want you around
when they do.

670
01:02:49,816 --> 01:02:51,784
I like you.

671
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,511
Maybe more than you like me.
I don't know.

672
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:02,124
Unless you're gonna tell me you're married
or something, I'm not staying away.

673
01:03:10,937 --> 01:03:12,837
You're married?

674
01:03:12,939 --> 01:03:15,669
For a long time.

675
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,951
Where is she?

676
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:29,283
Far away from here.

677
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,694
Well...

678
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:38,629
that's a relief.

679
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:40,631
I thought I lost it.

680
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:43,725
All this great equipment,
and you're sitting on your hands.

681
01:03:43,836 --> 01:03:47,294
I was telling myself, "He's a slow starter,
but it gets hot when he gets going."

682
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:50,467
You're important to me.
You are a friend.

683
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,738
- <i>You're more than a friend.</i>
- "Friend."

684
01:03:52,845 --> 01:03:56,508
- <i>You're more than that.</i>
- We're friends.

685
01:03:58,051 --> 01:04:00,576
When I wanna make friends,
I'll go to summer camp.

686
01:04:12,632 --> 01:04:14,964
You wanna hear
something funny?

687
01:04:16,002 --> 01:04:18,368
I was sort of flattered.

688
01:04:18,471 --> 01:04:21,338
I thought you were going slow because
you thought this was real important...

689
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:23,432
and you didn't
wanna blow it.

690
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:36,687
It's gonna take me a long time to figure out
which of us is the biggest asshole.

691
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,731
<i></i>
<i>God.! They don't make 'em like that anymore.</i>

692
01:04:52,271 --> 01:04:54,239
<i>Whoo.!</i>

693
01:05:02,448 --> 01:05:04,473
The whole thing
could blow up.

694
01:05:04,584 --> 01:05:07,519
- Patrovita's gonna get Lamanski.
- Mmm.

695
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:11,351
As long as they keep cutting down
the right people, I don't give a shit.

696
01:05:11,457 --> 01:05:15,223
Patrovita wants the money and the dope
the cops got when they raided him.

697
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:17,228
And he's gonna try
and get it.

698
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,298
You're kidding.

699
01:05:23,202 --> 01:05:25,136
You know what happens
if we stop this?

700
01:05:25,238 --> 01:05:29,368
Yeah. Since I'm the new boy,
they must figure that I'm the leak.

701
01:05:29,475 --> 01:05:33,036
Let 'em have it.
This is not the reason we're in this.

702
01:05:33,146 --> 01:05:37,173
- What about Lamanski?
- Considering how we're involved in this...

703
01:05:37,283 --> 01:05:39,183
I can't be of much
help to you, Mark.

704
01:05:39,285 --> 01:05:42,482
You're gonna have to
watch out for yourself.

705
01:05:43,923 --> 01:05:45,891
You want out?

706
01:05:52,465 --> 01:05:54,490
I started to call Amy
last night.

707
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,091
- I wanted her to know that I'm still alive.
- Dangerous.

708
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,899
Yeah. But I've
put her through a lot.

709
01:06:00,006 --> 01:06:03,942
But if we stop now,
the whole thing is for nothing.

710
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:06,409
And knowing Amy...

711
01:06:06,512 --> 01:06:09,276
she probably
will kill me herself.

712
01:06:14,454 --> 01:06:16,422
Are you gonna stick?

713
01:06:19,492 --> 01:06:22,518
This Joey has
a pretty good life.

714
01:06:22,628 --> 01:06:27,224
Expensive clothes,
a nice car...

715
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:30,325
lots of money
and free time.

716
01:06:32,338 --> 01:06:34,636
I never had it so good.

717
01:06:36,676 --> 01:06:38,803
Just don't let it go
to your head, all right?

718
01:06:43,983 --> 01:06:45,883
That's kind of sudden.

719
01:06:45,985 --> 01:06:47,885
You don't work good
on short notice?

720
01:06:47,987 --> 01:06:50,455
Nothing works
if it isn't thought out.

721
01:06:50,556 --> 01:06:52,683
They hit the 3rd District
in an hour.

722
01:06:52,792 --> 01:06:55,420
We'll waste Lamanski
as a diversion.

723
01:06:55,528 --> 01:06:57,496
It's my idea.

724
01:06:58,731 --> 01:07:01,393
What do you think?

725
01:07:01,501 --> 01:07:03,560
I'll let you know
when it's over.

726
01:07:13,146 --> 01:07:14,909

727
01:07:22,889 --> 01:07:24,857
We're ready.

728
01:07:37,003 --> 01:07:38,903
3rd District,
Sergeant Washington.

729
01:07:39,005 --> 01:07:44,307
You've got a bomb
inside the building.

730
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:48,437
It goes off in 22 minutes.

731
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,618
All right.
Everything's jammed.

732
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:03,621
We have a bomb.

733
01:08:03,729 --> 01:08:05,788
Call Bomb Disposal.

734
01:08:05,898 --> 01:08:08,765
Clear the building.

Bomb Disposal.

737
01:08:20,947 --> 01:08:25,543
Evacuate and barricade a perimeter
of 300 feet from the building.

738
01:08:25,651 --> 01:08:27,585
We're on the way.

741
01:08:33,593 --> 01:08:37,051

<i> Come on. Let's keep moving.</i>

01:08:56,983 --> 01:09:01,113
Watch out! Watch where you're going!

746
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:05,316
- Come on! Come on!
- Let's go, let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

747
01:09:07,093 --> 01:09:09,618
It's right down here.

748
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:14,560
Torch!

749
01:09:15,968 --> 01:09:17,697
<i>Come on.!</i>

750
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:29,047
You see him?
Lamanski.

751
01:09:30,816 --> 01:09:33,580
<i>Take him when he's clear.</i>

752
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:39,747
<i>Shit.! No way.</i>

753
01:09:39,859 --> 01:09:41,759
Where the fuck did all
those people come from?

754
01:09:41,861 --> 01:09:43,726
Maybe they play bingo.

755
01:09:43,829 --> 01:09:47,560
Do you own a calendar, Max?
I bet it's a Jewish holiday.

756
01:09:47,667 --> 01:09:50,932
<i>Yeah, well, for his sake,</i>
<i>it better be the Day of Atonement.</i>

757

<i>He's ready. Outta here.</i>

760
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:23,936
We're set.

761
01:10:29,008 --> 01:10:31,977
Oh, shit.

762
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:36,111
That's good.

763
01:10:36,215 --> 01:10:38,308
Guys, we're on the clock.

764
01:10:40,386 --> 01:10:43,719
- Come on.
- Here, fill this one.

765
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,775
<i> When we get to the expressway,</i>
<i>I'm gonna run him off the road.</i>

766
01:11:03,876 --> 01:11:06,106
Their car is much
heavier than ours.

767
01:11:06,212 --> 01:11:08,476
Wort matter
if you hit the driver.

768
01:11:46,419 --> 01:11:49,183

Run 'em into the wall.

771

Let's get outta here!

772
01:13:56,916 --> 01:13:59,851
<i>Wave your hands.!</i>

773
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:10,757
- Let's go, let's go.
- This is it. Let's make it look good.

774
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:13,358
Open the doors!

775
01:14:13,432 --> 01:14:15,332
- Clear!
- What happened in there?

776
01:14:15,434 --> 01:14:17,629
Stay clear!

777
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:41,786
I don't know who in the hell
this guy is.

778
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:45,489
- I've never seen him before.
- No mistake?

779
01:14:45,598 --> 01:14:50,661
Come on. Three years ago,
I busted Joey Brenner twice in two weeks.

780
01:14:51,704 --> 01:14:53,672
And that ain't him.

781
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:58,210
You know where he is?

782
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:01,304
Caribbean, I heard.

783
01:15:07,953 --> 01:15:10,319
When do you go back
to Miami?

784
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:12,617
In an hour.

785
01:15:15,361 --> 01:15:19,092
I've got a charity softball game with
Dade County Sheriffs in the morning.

786
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:22,099
Cops against cops.

787
01:15:22,201 --> 01:15:24,635
You leave me no one
to root for.

788
01:15:27,673 --> 01:15:29,664
So what the fuck are you
doing for the money?

789
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:33,472
- Sticking my ass out.
- Not far enough!

790
01:15:34,747 --> 01:15:38,046
Somebody got somebody inside.

791
01:15:38,150 --> 01:15:40,516
He's walking
all over the place.

792
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:43,383
He's even been to my house.

793
01:15:43,489 --> 01:15:46,049
He could be banging my wife,
for Christ's sake!

794
01:15:46,158 --> 01:15:49,650
He didn't get by me.
I don't know how the hell he got there.

795
01:15:49,762 --> 01:15:52,196
What the hell's the difference?
We got him, right?

796
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:55,131
Don't give me that "we" shit!
Max turned him up on his own.

797
01:15:55,234 --> 01:15:58,362
What do you want?
I can't tell you things I don't know about.

798
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:01,200
Well, what do
you know about?

799
01:16:02,941 --> 01:16:05,068
You're telling me
about this bureau creep...

800
01:16:05,177 --> 01:16:07,907
who's trying to take me apart
in his spare time...

801
01:16:08,013 --> 01:16:11,881
because his kid got smacked
when we took Marcellino.

802
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:14,646
So what's the good news?

803
01:16:14,753 --> 01:16:18,382
I had a friend at the bureau
check Harry Shannors case files.

804
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:22,449
Whatever he's doing is unofficial.
There aren't any records.

805
01:16:24,129 --> 01:16:29,089
If he were killed, there could be
no direct connection to you.

806
01:16:31,403 --> 01:16:35,806
Oh. That's the good news, huh?

807
01:16:35,908 --> 01:16:38,741
So who's gonna do it?
You?

808
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,648
Brenner.

809
01:16:47,219 --> 01:16:50,586
Yeah.

810
01:16:52,991 --> 01:16:54,891
I think I'd better
get going.

811
01:16:54,993 --> 01:16:57,587
Yeah? Where?
Canada? Mexico?

812
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:00,460
You're not getting out of my sight
until this is over and done.

813
01:17:00,566 --> 01:17:04,798
If you did some serious damage
to my organization...

814
01:17:04,903 --> 01:17:07,667
I wanna know where
I can lay my hands on you.

815
01:17:29,294 --> 01:17:31,194
I'll be right back.

816
01:17:31,296 --> 01:17:34,732
- Hey! We can't be late!
- Just a minute!

817
01:17:37,136 --> 01:17:39,036
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

818
01:17:39,138 --> 01:17:41,436
Sorry for the other night.

819
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:45,533
- Where would I learn how to deal with a friend?
- <i>It's okay.</i>

820
01:17:45,644 --> 01:17:48,135
<i>Let's go.!</i>

821
01:17:48,247 --> 01:17:50,408
I was thinking
maybe we could talk.

822
01:17:50,516 --> 01:17:52,950
I have
something to do.

823
01:17:53,051 --> 01:17:55,884
- Maybe later?
- <i>Sure.</i>

824
01:17:55,988 --> 01:17:58,218
- <i></i>
- Take my car and go home.

Don't worry.

830
01:19:24,243 --> 01:19:27,872
- <i>You gonna tell me who it is?</i>
- A cop.

831
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:30,175
Just a fucking cop.

832
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:33,542
Go straight at him.

833
01:19:33,652 --> 01:19:35,779
I'll take the far side.

01:30:12,757 --> 01:30:16,158
From the looks of that mess,
I'd say he was dead.

914
01:30:16,261 --> 01:30:18,161
I think he's right.

915
01:30:18,263 --> 01:30:20,356
Don't think, pray!

916
01:30:20,465 --> 01:30:22,990
If he's still alive,
you're not!

917
01:30:24,035 --> 01:30:27,596
Oh, shit!

918
01:30:31,042 --> 01:30:35,240
- Let's get him before he gets us! The elevators!
- Give me an extra clip.

919
01:30:35,346 --> 01:30:38,076
You! Stick around.

920
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:56,133
Hold it, hold it,
hold it, hold it!

921
01:30:58,403 --> 01:31:00,462

Kaminski?

This must be what they mean
by "poetic justice."

948
01:35:25,503 --> 01:35:28,370
This is... isn't what you think.
I'm with the government.

949
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:31,340
I set every one
of these guys up, and...

950
01:35:31,442 --> 01:35:35,242
So, back with the bureau, huh?
I didn't know that.

951
01:35:35,346 --> 01:35:37,473
It's, uh...

952
01:35:37,582 --> 01:35:40,813
You know, that whole thing
was such a mistake. You and I...

953
01:35:40,918 --> 01:35:44,319
Because of you,
a lot of people are dead.

954

And now it's your turn.

955
01:35:46,691 --> 01:35:50,218
No. No.

956
01:35:56,234 --> 01:35:59,965
Resign or be prosecuted.

962
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:42,369
- Okay, Lenny.
- They said you got room for one more, right?

963
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:45,745
- <i>Watch your back.</i>
- What do you think Baxter was doing here?

964
01:36:45,850 --> 01:36:48,876
Until I know different,
I gotta assume our leak's just been plugged.

965
01:36:48,986 --> 01:36:51,784
- Pardon the pun.
- What the hell you think happened here?

966
01:36:54,492 --> 01:36:56,392
I think somebody
got very pissed off.

967
01:36:56,494 --> 01:36:59,725
- Who?
- I got a good idea.

968
01:36:59,830 --> 01:37:02,924
Baker, just got a location on the car.

969
01:37:03,034 --> 01:37:08,336
- Give it to me.
- A 1979 Oldsmobile
registered to Luigi Patrovita...

970
01:37:08,439 --> 01:37:10,339
moving south on Route 84.

971
01:37:10,441 --> 01:37:12,341
- Should they intercept?
- No. Negative.

972
01:37:12,443 --> 01:37:15,537
- Tell them to track him.
Keep me up on where he is.
- Ten-four.

973
01:37:17,715 --> 01:37:20,047
Where are you going?

974
01:37:20,151 --> 01:37:22,676
I'm gonna see
how smart I am.

975
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:51,141
Get on the plane.

976
01:37:51,248 --> 01:37:53,216
You okay?

977
01:38:01,258 --> 01:38:04,386
- You're not going, are you?
- No.

978
01:38:04,495 --> 01:38:06,395
Then I'm not either.

979
01:38:06,497 --> 01:38:08,829
You're out of excuses,
sweetheart.

980
01:38:08,933 --> 01:38:11,299
There's a quarter million dollars
in that bag.

981
01:38:11,402 --> 01:38:14,269
Win or lose,
it's your choice.

982
01:38:14,372 --> 01:38:16,533
Now get out of here.

983
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:22,112
You'll be okay,
won't you?

984
01:38:33,324 --> 01:38:35,986
Get going.

985

986

make me chase you.

01:39:34,919 --> 01:39:37,683
Too damn tired.

988
01:39:37,788 --> 01:39:41,815
That doesn't surprise me. A hundred years
of police work in a single afternoon.

989
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:45,628
<i>Always figured</i>
<i>you were one of us.</i>

990
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,834
How many days in a row...

991
01:39:53,304 --> 01:39:56,501
do I have to haul
your butt down here?

992
01:39:56,607 --> 01:39:58,507
Hmm?

993
01:39:58,609 --> 01:40:01,271
Just to watch you
do nothing.

994
01:40:01,378 --> 01:40:03,539
I have no interest...

995
01:40:03,647 --> 01:40:07,242
in becoming
an accomplished cripple.

996
01:40:07,351 --> 01:40:11,310
Now you push me back to my room
or out into traffic. I don't give a shit.

997
01:40:12,556 --> 01:40:14,524
Things not so good, Harry?

998
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:22,164
- I've seen better days.
- Wanna see 'em again?

999
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:24,700
Wort happen from down here.

1000
01:40:27,772 --> 01:40:31,333
So, you used to being back
with the bureau?

1001
01:40:31,442 --> 01:40:33,535
Sure.

1002
01:40:33,644 --> 01:40:35,544
And back with my wife.

1003
01:40:35,646 --> 01:40:37,614
Thank you very much.

1004
01:40:41,018 --> 01:40:43,179
Come on, Mark!
Stop fooling around!

1005
01:40:43,287 --> 01:40:45,255
Give me...
Give me my chair.

1006
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:49,858
I need your help, Harry.

1007
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:52,053
For what?
Where's my chair?

1008
01:40:52,163 --> 01:40:55,189
My reunion with Amy
was a big success.

1009
01:40:57,234 --> 01:40:59,225
We just found out
that she's pregnant.

1010
01:40:59,336 --> 01:41:01,236
That's great.
That's great.

1011
01:41:01,338 --> 01:41:03,169
Give me my chair.

1012
01:41:03,274 --> 01:41:06,038
I don't know anything
about being a father, Harry.

1013
01:41:06,143 --> 01:41:08,611
I want your help.
I want you to be the godfather.

1014
01:41:08,712 --> 01:41:11,272
All right. I'll help.
Now give me the goddamn chair!

1015
01:41:11,382 --> 01:41:14,215
- Then walk.
- I can't walk!

1016
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:17,446
Then meet me halfway.
Come on.

1017
01:41:17,555 --> 01:41:20,217
I don't have to walk
to be a godfather!

1018
01:41:20,324 --> 01:41:23,657
You don't have to walk,
but you have to try like hell.

1019
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:32,158
- I can't!
- Did you ever quit in front of Blair?
