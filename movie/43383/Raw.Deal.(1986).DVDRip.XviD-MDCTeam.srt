1
00:02:15,207 --> 00:02:17,857
- Green light.
- Let's go.

2
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:26,817
How many times was John Wayne nominated
for an Academy Award?

3
00:02:26,918 --> 00:02:28,806
Probably not enough.

4
00:02:32,198 --> 00:02:34,205
Marcellino's still asleep.

5
00:02:38,022 --> 00:02:41,437
- I'm gonna go relieve Ed.
- How the hell can one son of a bitch sleep so much?

6
00:02:41,543 --> 00:02:43,910
- Fear.
- As long as he wakes up to testify.

7
00:03:20,102 --> 00:03:23,485
Oh, no.

8
00:03:32,326 --> 00:03:34,366
We've been looking for you.

9
00:03:36,294 --> 00:03:38,978
- So you want to be a witness?
- No, no, no, no!

10
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,217
Witness this.

11
00:03:49,254 --> 00:03:51,425
His birthday
was in two weeks.

12
00:03:51,526 --> 00:03:54,722
Harry, they wanna
take him out.

13
00:03:54,822 --> 00:03:56,710
Harry?

14
00:04:01,862 --> 00:04:07,459
Twenty-seven years of this shit,
and I never got a scratch. Jesus Christ.

15
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:12,260
I want a list of everybody
in Witness Protection...

16
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:14,180
who knew we
were holding Marcellino...

17
00:04:14,278 --> 00:04:16,383
and anybody else
who could've known...

18
00:04:16,486 --> 00:04:18,690
from the district attorney
to the commissioner.

19
00:04:19,942 --> 00:04:21,830
They're dead, Mike.

20
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:23,814
Whoever set this up...

21
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,694
whatever it takes...

22
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:30,268
they're dead.

23
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,676
Okay, Cullen. You're outta here.

24
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:44,988
Hey, you goddamn son of a...

25
00:06:08,774 --> 00:06:11,458
- Whoa!
- Damn!

26
00:07:29,895 --> 00:07:32,066
Aah!

27
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:35,909
<i>Yes, sir. Well, a number
of the residents have complained...</i>

28
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:40,229
<i>though, about the trash around the Dumpster,
so I think you should do something about it.</i>

29
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:44,701
Yes, sir. Heh! All right.
Have a good day then.

30
00:07:51,302 --> 00:07:53,691
- You caught the bastard.
- In the act.

31
00:07:53,798 --> 00:07:56,318
Bullshit. I was on my way
to a costume party.

32
00:07:56,423 --> 00:08:00,252
He stopped somebody over at Route 74
for driving too fast.

33
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:02,977
- He was going to let them off for 50 bucks.
- They stopped me for directions.

34
00:08:03,078 --> 00:08:04,966
Book him.

35
00:08:06,246 --> 00:08:09,213
Impersonating an officer,
resisting arrest...

36
00:08:09,318 --> 00:08:13,595
fraud, reckless driving
and lying to the sheriff.

37
00:08:13,703 --> 00:08:16,255
- I'll be at home if you need me.
- Okay, Sheriff.

38
00:08:20,678 --> 00:08:24,027
Come on, Deputy Dawg.

39
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:47,195
<i>Amy! Amy!</i>

40
00:08:53,478 --> 00:08:55,583
Amy?

41
00:08:55,686 --> 00:08:57,574
Amy?

42
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:03,937
- Are we having a party?
- Of course...

43
00:09:04,038 --> 00:09:07,999
and I'm glad you're home early
to join in the celebration.

44
00:09:08,102 --> 00:09:10,819
Is it just gonna be us,
or are we gonna have company?

45
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:14,234
Be serious. Of course it's just us.

46
00:09:14,342 --> 00:09:16,797
So, what are we celebrating?

47
00:09:17,926 --> 00:09:20,511
Commemorating...

48
00:09:20,614 --> 00:09:23,930
our fifth year.

49
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:28,315
Five years in exile.
Five years in a town without...

50
00:09:28,422 --> 00:09:31,586
having found anybody who could talk
about anything except...

51
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:33,857
crops and the weather.

52
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,675
- It's not gonna be forever.
- The hell it's not.

53
00:09:38,694 --> 00:09:41,344
Christ, Amy, this is old news.
Let it go.

54
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:44,480
- I did the best I could.
- The hell you did.

55
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:47,070
You could still be with the bureau.
You could've fought it.

56
00:09:47,174 --> 00:09:50,470
We could still be living in New York.
You did not have to quit!

57
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:53,086
They gave me a chance to resign.
If it would've gone to trial...

58
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,742
I would've lost
and they would've kicked me out.

59
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:59,010
I wouldn't have even had
the chance to get this job!

60
00:10:09,798 --> 00:10:12,416
What are we having
for dinner?

61
00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:14,405
Just this.

62
00:10:18,726 --> 00:10:20,865
This is gonna make us fat.

63
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:23,933
You think because we're in shape
we're not already fat?

64
00:10:24,038 --> 00:10:26,907
<i>We're like all the cows
they raise around here.</i>

65
00:10:27,014 --> 00:10:30,789
Stuck.
Victims of circumstance.

66
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:35,555
And you know what a cow's
biggest contribution to this world is?

67
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:49,693
You should not drink
and bake.

68
00:11:43,462 --> 00:11:45,284
Hello, Mark.

69
00:11:45,382 --> 00:11:48,797
- Yeah?
- It's Shannon, Mark. Harry Shannon.

70
00:11:48,902 --> 00:11:53,691
It's been a long time, Harry.
What's going on?

71
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:57,027
I want to talk to you, Mark.
I got trouble.

72
00:11:57,126 --> 00:12:00,574
- Talk.
- No. Not on the telephone.

73
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,328
It's all I've got time for.

74
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,147
Things aren't so good,
huh, kid?

75
00:12:06,246 --> 00:12:08,351
Seen better days.

76
00:12:08,453 --> 00:12:11,966
If you wanna see 'em again,
meet me.

77
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:48,772
The bureau always arranges
such intriguing meeting places.

78
00:12:50,085 --> 00:12:52,868
This has nothing to do with the bureau.

79
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:57,438
Mr. Patrovita,
you deny any sources of illicit income...

80
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:59,778
any connection at all
with organized crime...

81
00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:04,963
yet your reported income
for this past year was $73,000...

82
00:13:05,062 --> 00:13:08,837
<i>with which you somehow
managed to maintain...</i>

83
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:11,781
a seven-bedroom mansion
here in Chicago...

84
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:14,114
<i>a hunting lodge in Wisconsin...</i>

85
00:13:14,214 --> 00:13:16,319
<i>a winter resort in California...</i>

86
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:19,236
four Cadillacs that we know of...

87
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:22,301
and a lifestyle that makes
Ted Turner look like a derelict.

88
00:13:22,406 --> 00:13:25,886
Now, can you explain
how you manage this?

89
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,899
I think it'd be of particular interest
to those of us...

90
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:30,275
<i>- on fixed incomes.
- Hold it. That's Baxter.</i>

91
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:32,861
- I know, I know.
- What the hell has he got to do with it?

92
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:36,479
- He's special federal prosecutor.
- That son of a bitch cost me a career.

93
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,713
You brought in a suspect with
half the bones in his body broken.

94
00:13:39,814 --> 00:13:42,748
- Any prosecutor would've gone after you.
- Oh, you remember the case.

95
00:13:42,854 --> 00:13:45,341
The guy kidnapped
an 11-year-old girl.

96
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:47,901
He molested, murdered
and mutilated her.

97
00:13:48,006 --> 00:13:52,708
Well, the public wasrt too keen
on heavy-handed cops at that time.

98
00:13:52,806 --> 00:13:55,588
Baxter was out
to nail me to the wall.

99
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:58,500
- I went to see him, tried to tell him what happened...
- What did he say?

100
00:13:58,597 --> 00:14:02,459
Resign or be prosecuted.
Any way you want it.

101
00:14:02,566 --> 00:14:04,737
Yeah, well,
the good news is that...

102
00:14:04,838 --> 00:14:08,700
he's giving Patrovita a lot more shit
than he ever gave you.

103
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:11,260
<i>I got a lotta debts.</i>

104
00:14:11,366 --> 00:14:15,359
Uh-huh. To whom?

105
00:14:15,462 --> 00:14:19,553
- Friends.
- Like Paulo Rocca and Bill Rusman?

106
00:14:24,294 --> 00:14:26,782
I plead the Fifth Amendment.

107
00:14:26,886 --> 00:14:28,926
<i>That's Lu Patrovita.</i>

108
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,412
He runs the strongest
of the Chicago families.

109
00:14:37,765 --> 00:14:41,311
<i>- Mr. Rocca,
your stated source of income...</i>

110
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:44,829
is a travel agency, yet you,
like Mr. Patrovita...

111
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:49,189
seem to, uh, have a lifestyle
that far exceeds your income.

112
00:14:49,285 --> 00:14:51,904
Would you mind shedding some light
for us on what seems to be...

113
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:54,307
some extraordinary
money management here?

114
00:14:54,406 --> 00:14:58,017
I'll take the Fifth on this,
on whatever you're gonna ask me next...

115
00:14:58,117 --> 00:15:00,059
<i>and everything after that.</i>

116
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:04,094
Honest men don't have to tolerate
this kind of harassment in this country.

117
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:08,027
Thank you, Mr. Rocca,
for reminding us of our inalienable rights.

118
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:09,956
<i>Rocca is the undertaker.</i>

119
00:15:10,053 --> 00:15:13,850
<i>Anybody bothers Patrovita,
this one buries 'em in the gravel pit.</i>

120
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:19,293
<i>So we did Who's Who In Chicago. You're the one
in the bureau. What do you want from me?</i>

121
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:26,749
Do, uh...
Do you remember my son?

122
00:15:26,854 --> 00:15:32,004
Blair. Yeah. We went to
some ball games with him.

123
00:15:32,102 --> 00:15:35,298
- Yeah, that's right.
- He joined the bureau, didn't he?

124
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,488
Yep.

125
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,477
<i>How is he?</i>

126
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,845
Dead.

127
00:15:53,797 --> 00:15:55,968
I want Patrovita.

128
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:01,093
- He killed Blair?
- Blair was covering a government aide...

129
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:04,157
a witness who could've
put the bastard away forever.

130
00:16:05,158 --> 00:16:07,067
No.

131
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,214
No, he had
somebody do it.

132
00:16:10,725 --> 00:16:14,784
There's nothing that a small-town sheriff
can do that you can't.

133
00:16:14,886 --> 00:16:18,431
Oh, no, no. The bureau
has nothing to do with this.

134
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:21,251
No, I'm financing
this myself.

135
00:16:21,349 --> 00:16:24,765
I have $45,000
in savings.

136
00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:31,835
I want you to get inside the Patrovita
organization and tear it up.

137
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:35,455
Who do you think I look like?
Dirty Harry?

138
00:16:35,558 --> 00:16:39,452
- I think you look like an unappy man.
- You have a cure?

139
00:16:39,558 --> 00:16:41,630
Possible reinstatement.

140
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,774
Get back into the bureau.

141
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,146
<i>- Hmm?
- How?</i>

142
00:16:46,245 --> 00:16:50,369
The bureau's been trying to get somebody
inside of Patrovita's family for over a year...

143
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,536
but there's
a big leak somewhere.

144
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,677
All our guys
keep getting nailed.

145
00:16:55,782 --> 00:17:01,379
That's why no one but me
will know about you. Nobody.

146
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:07,042
Now, you do a good job, you pull this off,
and you've got a great shot.

147
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:09,443
<i>Now, what do you say?</i>

148
00:17:10,534 --> 00:17:12,901
Do you think I'd
still pass the physical?

149
00:17:56,325 --> 00:18:01,628
This is Kaminski, investigating a break-in
at the Petrolcam storage yard.

150
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:04,035
Roger, Sheriff. We copy.

151
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,813
I'm sorry you had to kill yourself off, kid...

152
00:19:22,918 --> 00:19:25,667
but it's safer
for everybody that way.

153
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:29,114
<i>The top slot
is Luigi Patrovita.</i>

154
00:19:29,222 --> 00:19:32,604
<i>He's been up there for over 20 years.
He's smart.</i>

155
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,906
<i>Buried a marching band
getting where he is.</i>

156
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,492
<i>His right arm is
a guy named Rocca.</i>

157
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,721
<i>He'd kill for table scraps.</i>

158
00:19:42,822 --> 00:19:44,829
<i>Him you watch close.</i>

159
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,925
The false I.D. Corresponds
to a guy...

160
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:52,063
in the N.C.I. Computer
with a bad rap sheet.

161
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,621
The phone number
is a safe house...

162
00:19:54,725 --> 00:19:57,857
where an answering machine
is set up to catch your bulletins.

163
00:19:57,957 --> 00:20:02,332
There's $25,000 for initial expenses;
more if you need it.

164
00:20:02,437 --> 00:20:06,332
The squat-face guy is a new kid on the block.
His name is "Hammer" Lamanski.

165
00:20:06,437 --> 00:20:10,714
He's been biting off
little pieces of Patrovita's pie.

166
00:20:10,822 --> 00:20:13,953
<i>Doing damage to him
is probably your quickest way...</i>

167
00:20:14,054 --> 00:20:16,607
<i>to catch the big mars eye.</i>

168
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:19,808
<i>Remember, there's a leak.</i>

169
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,292
<i>He's the one
who got Blair killed.</i>

170
00:20:23,398 --> 00:20:25,307
<i>He's the one I want.</i>

171
00:20:25,414 --> 00:20:27,835
<i>Well, see ya in Chicago.</i>

172
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,497
Big player, number eight!

173
00:20:34,597 --> 00:20:37,019
<i>Place your bets. Place your bets.
Place your bets.</i>

174
00:20:38,854 --> 00:20:41,472
Place your bets.
Place your bets.

175
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:47,875
All bets down.
All bets down.

176
00:20:49,766 --> 00:20:52,253
Throw the dice!

177
00:20:53,893 --> 00:20:58,236
Seven! You lose.
Come and get another number.

178
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:00,414
Come and get
another number.

179
00:21:00,517 --> 00:21:03,103
I don't think the table is straight.
I want to see Mr. Lamanski.

180
00:21:03,206 --> 00:21:06,751
He's not around, pal. And all losers
don't think a table is straight.

181
00:21:06,854 --> 00:21:09,123
I'm still right.

182
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:16,156
<i>Oh, shit! Yeah? So what?
Looks like the table's fixed.</i>

183
00:21:16,261 --> 00:21:20,571
<i>This table's fixed! You scumbag! Hey, look
at that! That's bullshit! That's my money!</i>

184
00:21:22,693 --> 00:21:26,971
- Magic or magnet?
- Rudy! Rudy!

185
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,859
Hey, you! Get outta here!

186
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:32,029
Scram!
Who the fuck are you?

187
00:21:58,277 --> 00:22:00,666
Hey! Wait up!

188
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:29,913
Guys, make sure to clean up the mess
before you knock off, okay?

189
00:23:08,933 --> 00:23:11,038
I'm gonna kill
that bastard.

190
00:23:17,957 --> 00:23:21,536
Excuse me. Could you move
to the side a little bit?

191
00:23:21,637 --> 00:23:24,572
- Your lights.
- Thank you.

192
00:23:32,422 --> 00:23:34,593
Oh, shit!

193
00:24:08,837 --> 00:24:11,259
It's costing us a lot of money
to get together like this...

194
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:15,708
because now my time
is won'th as much as yours.

195
00:24:15,813 --> 00:24:17,636
- Worth more.
- Hmm?

196
00:24:17,733 --> 00:24:20,995
- You got less of it.
- I gave you the courtesy of this talk...

197
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:23,613
because you worked
for me a long time.

198
00:24:23,717 --> 00:24:27,295
Like I said,
close down everything and get out...

199
00:24:27,397 --> 00:24:29,601
or one morning you
are gonna wake up dead.

200
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:33,727
Luigi, I got employees, obligations...
There's plenty for both of us.

201
00:24:33,829 --> 00:24:37,953
There's no "both of us. "
There's just me.

202
00:24:38,054 --> 00:24:42,177
- You got two days.
- And then what? Back to work for you?

203
00:24:42,277 --> 00:24:46,467
You don't work around here
anymore for me...

204
00:24:46,565 --> 00:24:48,704
or anybody.

205
00:24:51,813 --> 00:24:54,017
<i>Auggie, let's move one out.</i>

206
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:03,261
You got it.

207
00:25:12,293 --> 00:25:14,333
Get down! Move it!

208
00:25:29,477 --> 00:25:33,787
Fucking Lamanski! Who the hell
does that son of a bitch think he is?

209
00:25:33,893 --> 00:25:35,867
<i>- He thinks he can take me outjust like that?
- Come on!</i>

210
00:25:35,973 --> 00:25:38,209
That bastard's crazy!

211
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:41,342
He's a fucking amateur!
He learned nothing from me!

212
00:25:41,445 --> 00:25:43,933
- I'm still okay, right?
- Yeah.

213
00:25:44,037 --> 00:25:46,787
<i>Just a waste
of fucking bullets.</i>

214
00:25:46,885 --> 00:25:49,219
Tony was a good kid.

215
00:25:49,317 --> 00:25:51,772
Make sure you get
a good replacement for him.

216
00:25:51,877 --> 00:25:54,243
You son of a bitch!

217
00:26:17,605 --> 00:26:20,539
- Hey, you got the wrong car, pal.
- Shut up.

218
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:22,979
Hey, you know
who it belongs to?

219
00:26:23,077 --> 00:26:27,103
Yeah, a guy who is probably gonna be dead
before it's out of warranty.

220
00:26:37,317 --> 00:26:41,212
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you. Drive.

221
00:26:45,253 --> 00:26:48,417
<i>- What do you want?
- Take off all your jewelry.</i>

222
00:26:48,517 --> 00:26:52,640
- Do you know who bought all this stuff?
- Martin Lamanski.

223
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:56,603
He has good taste in jewelry,
but you've a rotten taste in men.

224
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:58,596
Come on.

225
00:26:59,589 --> 00:27:01,629
Gonna mess up your hair.

226
00:27:06,629 --> 00:27:08,865
Attagirl. Keep going.

227
00:27:30,597 --> 00:27:34,394
Fucking shit!
You took my lunch, you son of a bitch!

228
00:27:43,077 --> 00:27:44,965
Good evening, sir.

229
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:54,276
<i>Down.</i>

230
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:58,431
- There is no down.
- Hey, I'm not a cop.

231
00:27:58,533 --> 00:28:00,421
I'm a player.

232
00:28:07,844 --> 00:28:10,594
- A martini on me.
- Get you a drink?

233
00:28:10,693 --> 00:28:12,733
- Oh, bartender.
- Yes, sir, a Manattan.

234
00:28:12,837 --> 00:28:14,725
Yeah, another one.

235
00:28:15,973 --> 00:28:18,559
What do you need?

236
00:28:18,661 --> 00:28:21,475
Couple of minutes
with Mr. Rocca.

237
00:28:21,573 --> 00:28:26,527
- Not possible.
- Tell him I'm the pain in Lamanski's ass.

238
00:28:26,629 --> 00:28:29,924
Wait here.

239
00:28:30,021 --> 00:28:34,396
- You're working for Morgan and Company, right?
- Richard's supposed to meet us.

240
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:39,615
Ladies and gentlemen,
place your bets.

241
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,565
Cards?

242
00:28:47,653 --> 00:28:51,068
- Losing improves your character.
- Winning improves your wardrobe.

243
00:28:51,173 --> 00:28:53,955
<i>Again, place your bets,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

244
00:28:54,053 --> 00:28:56,508
<i>Cards?</i>

245
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:19,908
<i>Go on in.</i>

246
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:35,073
What's your name?

247
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,474
Joseph P. Brenner...
Joey.

248
00:29:38,629 --> 00:29:41,760
And you're the pain
in Lamanski's ass, huh?

249
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:45,603
Wasted one of his joints
and took down a couple of his bag men.

250
00:29:46,724 --> 00:29:49,343
And this stuff
comes from his girlfriend.

251
00:29:51,141 --> 00:29:53,312
What'd you bother
with that for?

252
00:29:53,413 --> 00:29:56,674
Intimidation.
Let him know that nothing is safe.

253
00:29:56,773 --> 00:29:59,773
What are you
trying to prove?

254
00:29:59,877 --> 00:30:03,455
Joey, this is Max Keller.

255
00:30:03,556 --> 00:30:07,037
Max takes care of things...
all kinds of things.

256
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,134
- Trying to prove that maybe you can use me.
- For what?

257
00:30:11,236 --> 00:30:14,946
To take care of things...
all kinds of things.

258
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:19,039
That job's filled.

259
00:30:19,141 --> 00:30:21,596
I'm sure a smart man like Mr. Rocca
is always looking to upgrade.

260
00:30:21,701 --> 00:30:24,700
<i>- I'm the best there is.
- Max...</i>

261
00:30:24,805 --> 00:30:29,442
if you're the best there is,
the wheel would've never been invented.

262
00:30:31,492 --> 00:30:35,235
- How'd you know I was looking for somebody?
- I didn't.

263
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:37,437
I thought
I might get lucky.

264
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:40,388
Where're you from?

265
00:30:43,045 --> 00:30:45,434
The last few years?
Miami.

266
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,410
- Your references?
- I'm in the computer.

267
00:30:48,516 --> 00:30:51,833
I'm sure you can find a couple of cops
that can punch it up for you.

268
00:30:51,941 --> 00:30:55,934
What makes you think I'd be happy
to see Lamanski's ass kicked?

269
00:30:56,037 --> 00:31:01,220
You see, in Miami, we can tell everything
by the flow of the blow.

270
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:05,507
This Lamanski has been making
bigger buys every week.

271
00:31:05,604 --> 00:31:07,993
Now, I know he has been
biting into someone's action.

272
00:31:12,676 --> 00:31:15,295
Go see the cashier.

273
00:31:15,396 --> 00:31:18,811
She'll give you a thousand dollars
in chips. Enjoy yourself.

274
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:22,266
In case you forget,
I'll be checking back with you.

275
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:38,333
I don't believe
a fucking word he said.

276
00:31:41,476 --> 00:31:43,865
Girl Scouts build character...

277
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:47,808
and it's a lot cheaper.

278
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:50,723
You pester me,
I'll have you tossed out.

279
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,209
You have that kind
of clout around here?

280
00:31:53,317 --> 00:31:56,251
- They know me.
- I envy them.

281
00:31:56,357 --> 00:32:00,765
<i>- Place your bets.
- I'm sure nobody will mind if you go home before you're broke.</i>

282
00:32:00,868 --> 00:32:05,407
Don't trouble yourself over my money.
I always get more.

283
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:09,884
Getting it somewhere else
might change your luck.

284
00:32:41,156 --> 00:32:43,545
Where the hell
do you think he's going?

285
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:46,436
<i>Taking a leak?</i>

286
00:32:51,108 --> 00:32:53,345
He's in here? Perfect!

287
00:32:55,236 --> 00:32:58,749
If any more guys duck down that alley,
we're gonna start selling tickets.

288
00:33:01,893 --> 00:33:04,446
- Where'd he go?
- This way.

289
00:33:36,805 --> 00:33:39,620
Come on, come on!
Come on!

290
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:47,195
Forget it!

291
00:33:49,989 --> 00:33:51,996
- Hurry up!
- Wait up!

292
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:03,170
- Any trouble?
- Oh, nothing special.

293
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:07,491
- All these alleys probably have rats.
- You got some I.D.?

294
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:09,410
Sure.

295
00:34:10,597 --> 00:34:13,913
Saw those three guys
leave the hotel after ya.

296
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:17,468
Anything particular
or, uh, just a mugging?

297
00:34:17,573 --> 00:34:19,776
They had trouble telling me
what they wanted.

298
00:34:20,965 --> 00:34:22,874
Yeah, I'll bet.

299
00:34:22,981 --> 00:34:26,297
Joseph P. Brenner.
What's the "P" stand for?

300
00:34:26,404 --> 00:34:28,227
Pussy.

301
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,123
See ya around.

302
00:34:34,724 --> 00:34:37,506
<i>Harry, everything is
moving along fine.</i>

303
00:34:37,604 --> 00:34:39,491
The apartment is okay.

304
00:34:40,484 --> 00:34:43,331
I'm renting a car tomorrow.

305
00:34:43,428 --> 00:34:46,494
Something happened last night
that got me thinking.

306
00:34:46,596 --> 00:34:49,313
I might get into a spot
where a cop is shooting at me.

307
00:34:49,413 --> 00:34:51,551
Any idea how
I ought to handle it?

308
00:34:51,652 --> 00:34:54,587
Three back-busters jumped me.

309
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:58,402
I have a feeling that Max Keller
had something to do with it.

310
00:34:58,501 --> 00:35:04,000
Rocca is probably checking on me
as I talk. I'll stay in touch.

311
00:35:24,004 --> 00:35:25,859
Hi.

312
00:35:25,956 --> 00:35:29,666
When was the last time
you had a good piss?

313
00:35:47,652 --> 00:35:49,856
Hey, let me in. I gotta take a leak.

314
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,409
<i>- Freeze!
- Don't move!</i>

315
00:35:54,693 --> 00:35:57,343
- Hold it right there!
- In the back room! Cover me!

316
00:36:00,132 --> 00:36:02,587
- We got 'em now!
- Let's get out of here!

317
00:36:02,692 --> 00:36:05,310
<i>Freeze!</i>

318
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,518
- Hey, what the...
- Hold it!

319
00:36:10,661 --> 00:36:12,483
<i>Throw it!</i>

320
00:36:13,956 --> 00:36:17,272
- You got a paper?
- I got a warrant. You got your rights.

321
00:36:17,381 --> 00:36:20,381
Patrovita's got
a big fucking headache.

322
00:36:26,244 --> 00:36:30,434
Call the president.
I think we just fixed the deficit.

323
00:36:32,164 --> 00:36:35,263
That's $100 million
on the street.

324
00:36:35,365 --> 00:36:38,561
We can make it up
in a couple of weeks.

325
00:36:44,228 --> 00:36:47,195
Just what
Lamanski needed.

326
00:36:47,301 --> 00:36:51,491
If he's got a lot of shit on hand,
he's gonna step in at bargain prices...

327
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:54,272
and grab a great big chunk
of the business!

328
00:36:54,373 --> 00:36:57,090
Well, why don't we
just take him out?

329
00:36:57,189 --> 00:37:00,058
Because he's
looking for it!

330
00:37:00,164 --> 00:37:03,198
You won't get near him now,
unless you want to start a war.

331
00:37:04,196 --> 00:37:06,498
Nobody needs that.

332
00:37:08,165 --> 00:37:09,987
Later.

333
00:37:12,516 --> 00:37:14,905
<i>- How many got busted?
- Eight.</i>

334
00:37:15,012 --> 00:37:17,630
Nobody pulled a trigger.
They'll all make bail.

335
00:37:21,636 --> 00:37:24,353
Have you found
a replacement for Tony?

336
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:26,339
I'm looking somebody over.

337
00:37:30,597 --> 00:37:33,761
- I want it back.
- What?

338
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,610
The money. The smack.
It's mine. I want it back.

339
00:37:36,709 --> 00:37:39,491
Oh, come on! What are we gonna do,
knock over city hall?

340
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:41,825
We don't even know
where they got it stashed.

341
00:37:41,924 --> 00:37:45,023
But we know somebody
who can tell us.

342
00:37:45,124 --> 00:37:49,183
That shit is mine.
I paid for it, and I want it back.

343
00:37:52,548 --> 00:37:54,653
And I'm gonna get it back.

344
00:37:58,212 --> 00:38:01,060
How the hell is it
you never did any time?

345
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:04,223
I'm smart,
unlike someone we know.

346
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:08,034
Max thinks you stink
from trouble.

347
00:38:08,133 --> 00:38:11,678
<i>- He doesn't want you around.
- I'm sure he makes a lot of mistakes.</i>

348
00:38:11,781 --> 00:38:14,977
Never the same one twice.

349
00:38:15,076 --> 00:38:17,498
You're on.

350
00:38:19,236 --> 00:38:21,375
But consider yourself temporary.

351
00:38:28,549 --> 00:38:32,062
<i>And if Max is right,
very temporary.</i>

352
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,268
We start tomorrow.

353
00:38:41,092 --> 00:38:43,296
It's nice to be
one of the family.

354
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:50,171
- Get my car, please.
- Yes, sir.

355
00:38:52,676 --> 00:38:55,426
Sam, could you
get me a cab, please?

356
00:38:57,253 --> 00:38:59,140
<i>Taxi!</i>

357
00:39:00,164 --> 00:39:02,204
How'd you do
the other night?

358
00:39:02,308 --> 00:39:05,374
- Your money didn't change a thing.
- And tonight?

359
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,680
I got out with cab fare.

360
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,911
Maybe you should try
a different kind of recreation.

361
00:39:13,156 --> 00:39:15,458
Losing at tennis
wouldn't make me feel any better.

362
00:39:15,556 --> 00:39:17,498
The exercise might.

363
00:39:28,581 --> 00:39:30,621
- We don't need you.
- Thanks, pal.

364
00:39:30,724 --> 00:39:32,611
Okay. Thank you.

365
00:39:33,733 --> 00:39:36,450
You're a real
take-charge guy.

366
00:39:39,268 --> 00:39:42,716
Hold your glass very still.

367
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,107
Oh!

368
00:39:46,213 --> 00:39:48,668
Huh!

369
00:39:48,772 --> 00:39:54,206
Oh. I don't know why they advertise
all those sleeping pills on television.

370
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:57,090
I mean, chemicals are
no good for you.

371
00:39:59,524 --> 00:40:03,779
A couple of bottles of champagne
wipes you right out.

372
00:40:03,876 --> 00:40:05,916
Exactly.

373
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:12,795
What are you saying?
Are you saying you're ready for bed?

374
00:40:14,244 --> 00:40:19,230
- I think so.
- That sounds like a hell of an idea to me.

375
00:40:21,604 --> 00:40:24,571
Gonna help you get up.
Ooh!

376
00:40:24,676 --> 00:40:26,912
Uuh! God!

377
00:40:27,012 --> 00:40:29,052
- Here.
- There you go.

378
00:40:29,156 --> 00:40:31,044
There you go.

379
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,987
Come on. Hurry.

380
00:40:34,084 --> 00:40:37,400
Oh, God!

381
00:40:38,916 --> 00:40:41,916
- You know what I like about bedrooms?
- No. What?

382
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,500
You almost always
find a bed in there.

383
00:40:48,005 --> 00:40:50,241
You know what?

384
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,536
I've noticed
the same thing.

385
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,787
Oh, my God.

386
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,227
Great.

387
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,291
Uuh!

388
00:41:36,676 --> 00:41:40,931
<i>I've got what there is.</i>

389
00:41:41,028 --> 00:41:45,665
<i>Joseph P. Brenner.
Social Security number, 567-3...</i>

390
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,998
<i>567-34-5787</i>

391
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,680
Dade County licence number...

392
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:00,537
48736892-R.

393
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,387
Passport number...

394
00:42:04,484 --> 00:42:09,503
H-1032642.

395
00:42:09,604 --> 00:42:12,572
Okay? He's asleep.

396
00:42:17,092 --> 00:42:19,296
<i>He's passed out.</i>

397
00:42:19,396 --> 00:42:22,266
<i>This takes care of a thousand dollars
of my I.O.U., right?</i>

398
00:42:23,268 --> 00:42:25,155
<i>Okay.</i>

399
00:42:25,252 --> 00:42:28,252
If there's something to say,
I'll call.

400
00:42:44,836 --> 00:42:47,618
<i>We wanted to check
your water heater today, Sarah...</i>

401
00:42:47,716 --> 00:42:52,505
but the, uh, keys werert where they were
supposed to be, so we couldn't do anything.

402
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:57,314
If you tell us where the keys have been moved,
we'll come back and take care of it.

403
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:02,713
Look, come back to me
as quick as you can.

404
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:06,813
Yeah, you don't want
to freeze to death in that water.

405
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:09,534
- Fucking little worm.
- What's his problem?

406
00:43:09,636 --> 00:43:12,352
We give him a million dollars
to tell us where to hit Marcellino.

407
00:43:12,452 --> 00:43:15,038
Now the son of a bitch
is pulling back.

408
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,442
Well, maybe he doesn't know
where the shit is stored.

409
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:23,137
How many places do you think the cops
can store that much cash and smack, huh?

410
00:43:23,236 --> 00:43:25,341
<i>Lfhe doesn't know it,
he'll find out.</i>

411
00:43:25,444 --> 00:43:28,706
Or maybe he just doesn't like
what you're planning.

412
00:43:28,804 --> 00:43:32,066
I'm supposed to give a shit
what he thinks?

413
00:43:32,164 --> 00:43:35,874
No, he'll come across.
What the hell's his choice?

414
00:43:35,972 --> 00:43:38,972
<i>- He's in up to his ass.
- There's no way I can talk you out of this?</i>

415
00:43:39,076 --> 00:43:43,583
If you could, I shouldn't be where I am.

416
00:43:43,684 --> 00:43:46,783
When we start thinking
there's something we can't do...

417
00:43:46,884 --> 00:43:50,812
something that's too big or too messy,
then we oughta get out.

418
00:43:50,915 --> 00:43:54,298
This is like wrestling.
It's fixed.

419
00:43:54,404 --> 00:43:57,819
And the cops are always gonna lose,
and they know it.

420
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:13,312
<i>I wanna hear you say
you're sorry</i>

421
00:44:13,412 --> 00:44:17,503
<i>Nobody takes advantage of me</i>

422
00:44:17,604 --> 00:44:19,491
<i>Uuh</i>

423
00:44:19,588 --> 00:44:21,857
Over here, honey.

424
00:44:21,956 --> 00:44:24,160
Jeanine! Over here!

425
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,547
<i>If looks could kill</i>

426
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,249
<i>You'd be lying on the floor</i>

427
00:44:37,347 --> 00:44:40,064
<i>You'd be begging me
Please, please</i>

428
00:44:40,164 --> 00:44:42,335
<i>Baby, don't you
hurt me no more</i>

429
00:44:42,436 --> 00:44:45,306
- Where's Metzger?
- I haven't seen him.

430
00:44:45,412 --> 00:44:47,932
- How's business?
- We're dying.

431
00:44:48,036 --> 00:44:50,621
<i>We're living on the edge
Hanging by a thread</i>

432
00:44:50,724 --> 00:44:53,855
<i>I'm watching every move
you make</i>

433
00:44:53,956 --> 00:44:56,607
<i>You don't wanna see my anger</i>

434
00:44:56,708 --> 00:44:58,813
<i>So don't you make
another mistake</i>

435
00:44:58,916 --> 00:45:00,804
That's him!

436
00:45:02,596 --> 00:45:06,971
<i>That's a harmless, empty threat</i>

437
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,928
Hey! Watch it!

438
00:45:12,036 --> 00:45:13,858
- Stop it!
- Asshole!

439
00:45:13,956 --> 00:45:16,923
<i>- If looks could kill -
Do you mind? - Come on!</i>

440
00:45:17,028 --> 00:45:19,297
<i>- You'd be lying on the floor
- Cut it out!</i>

441
00:45:19,396 --> 00:45:23,356
<i>- Hey, you cretin!
- You'd be begging me, please, please</i>

442
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,289
<i>- Oh, God!
- Baby, don't hurt me no more</i>

443
00:45:27,396 --> 00:45:29,665
Uh! No, no! No, please!

444
00:45:29,764 --> 00:45:31,651
<i>Come here!</i>

445
00:45:31,748 --> 00:45:33,635
- Help me!
- Come here!

446
00:45:36,228 --> 00:45:38,529
I hear you're paying off everybody
but the fucking government.

447
00:45:38,628 --> 00:45:42,043
- Lamanski says pay him. He'll come back with a torch.
- So you decided to pay us both.

448
00:45:42,148 --> 00:45:44,668
- Is that it? I didn't know you had so much loose cash.
- Just stay out of it.

449
00:45:44,772 --> 00:45:48,547
- No. I'm gonna close down.
- Oh, yeah? You try it, all right?

450
00:45:48,643 --> 00:45:51,677
<i>You piece of shit!</i>

451
00:45:53,732 --> 00:45:56,001
- Uh!
- Ah! Do something, huh?

452
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:06,075
<i>- Oh, my God!
- This is what you're gonna look like dead.</i>

453
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:08,187
<i>Don't pay Lamanski anymore.</i>

454
00:46:08,292 --> 00:46:10,976
If I torch this shit-house,
you'll be inside it.

455
00:46:12,612 --> 00:46:14,750
Get in my way again,
and I'll kill ya.

456
00:46:15,012 --> 00:46:17,314
I hope you're not
your mother's only child.

457
00:46:17,412 --> 00:46:21,503
Ohh! Oh, Mr. Metzger,
are you all right?

458
00:46:21,604 --> 00:46:24,571
<i>Iflooks could</i>

459
00:46:24,676 --> 00:46:26,563
<i>Kill</i>

460
00:46:28,484 --> 00:46:32,826
- I didn't think you were this twisted.
- Twisted? This is kid stuff.

461
00:46:32,932 --> 00:46:35,452
We got a call. Somebody thought
there was some trouble here.

462
00:46:35,556 --> 00:46:38,011
Oh, the boys were having
some trouble with their makeup.

463
00:46:38,115 --> 00:46:42,785
Joey P. Brenner. You turn up
in the most damnedest places.

464
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:45,186
Trying to learn
my way around.

465
00:46:45,283 --> 00:46:48,993
Well, you got a good guide if you wanna
know your way around a sewer.

466
00:46:49,092 --> 00:46:51,513
<i>Iflooks could kill</i>

467
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:55,962
- Where do you know that cop from?
- Oh, he broke up a fight I had in an alley...

468
00:46:56,068 --> 00:46:59,384
the night you sent your three assholes
to take me apart.

469
00:47:04,483 --> 00:47:06,523
<i>We don't know what his name is yet...</i>

470
00:47:06,628 --> 00:47:08,668
<i>but he's definitely
working for Patrovita.</i>

471
00:47:08,772 --> 00:47:12,995
- I don't want his name. I want his ass.
- I'll see to it he disappears.

472
00:47:14,724 --> 00:47:17,539
First you bust him up real good,
public and messy.

473
00:47:17,636 --> 00:47:20,385
Everybody should know what you get
when you kick in my door.

474
00:47:25,316 --> 00:47:27,355
Shit, I hate this game.

475
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:30,809
This looks like
it's going to be fun.

476
00:47:30,915 --> 00:47:34,145
- That'd be different.
- Why? He's not a good host?

477
00:47:34,243 --> 00:47:37,025
Some of his friends
can be a pain in the neck.

478
00:47:37,123 --> 00:47:39,295
Hey, you're with
the main man.

479
00:47:39,395 --> 00:47:42,046
If you have any trouble, you let me know.

480
00:47:52,932 --> 00:47:56,380
- Wear that one.
- Beautiful, beautiful. Give it some sparkle.

481
00:47:56,483 --> 00:47:59,549
- Such a pretty dress.
- Oh, like this?

482
00:48:00,675 --> 00:48:02,498
Joey.

483
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:04,767
I was hoping
you could make it.

484
00:48:04,867 --> 00:48:06,690
Monique.

485
00:48:06,787 --> 00:48:09,024
- Quite a party.
- Party?

486
00:48:09,124 --> 00:48:11,807
This is just a simple gathering
of the immediate family.

487
00:48:11,908 --> 00:48:14,974
Luigi's parties
have to be held outdoors.

488
00:48:15,075 --> 00:48:17,050
He wants to meet you.

489
00:48:17,156 --> 00:48:19,043
Be right back.

490
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:27,512
Hey, you guys having fun? I'm having a lot of fun.

491
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,489
Let's capture the moment here,
huh? Come on.

492
00:48:30,596 --> 00:48:34,905
Max, maybe you're
having too much fun.

493
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:36,899
Eat something.

494
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:43,906
- I'll get you a nice eight by ten.
- Keep it. I'm not sentimental.

495
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,859
I didn't think so.

496
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,147
Come in.

497
00:48:58,531 --> 00:49:02,787
- Joey Brenner, Luigi Patrovita.
- My pleasure.

498
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,479
You like getting close
to our friend?

499
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:11,034
You want the job
done right, don't you?

500
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:14,206
- What have you found out?
- Nothing.

501
00:49:18,116 --> 00:49:20,156
I want you.

502
00:49:20,259 --> 00:49:22,169
We tried that,
remember?

503
00:49:22,275 --> 00:49:25,592
You come home with me,
and you owe nobody nothing.

504
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,089
I'll owe you,
won't I?

505
00:49:28,195 --> 00:49:32,254
Mr. Rocca thinks you would make
a won'thwhile addition...

506
00:49:32,356 --> 00:49:36,414
- to our various endeavors.
- I like to think so.

507
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,581
<i>- Oh, you're a thinker.
- Sometimes.</i>

508
00:49:39,684 --> 00:49:41,756
Not enough to get me
into any trouble.

509
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:46,300
From what we know,
you don't stay anyplace too long.

510
00:49:46,404 --> 00:49:49,917
If you're not part of an organization
that can protect you...

511
00:49:50,019 --> 00:49:54,809
- moving around is the next best thing.
- He's looking for a home.

512
00:49:56,931 --> 00:49:59,997
You kill anybody, Joey?

513
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,987
Yeah.

514
00:50:04,963 --> 00:50:07,549
More than one?

515
00:50:07,651 --> 00:50:11,448
Three. You want names
and addresses?

516
00:50:20,548 --> 00:50:23,963
<i>Smart, I like.</i>

517
00:50:24,067 --> 00:50:26,434
Smart-ass, I don't.

518
00:50:29,475 --> 00:50:33,599
All right. Forget it. Go back to the party.
I want to talk to Mr. Rocca.

519
00:50:36,164 --> 00:50:38,051
Nice meeting you.

520
00:50:45,603 --> 00:50:47,491
I don't know.

521
00:50:52,067 --> 00:50:54,915
You don't let him in
too far too fast.

522
00:50:55,012 --> 00:50:57,794
Give him a little time
to impress us.

523
00:50:57,892 --> 00:51:02,594
If he doesn't, we'll use him for
something dirty and dump him in the pit.

524
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:05,441
Cute, huh?

525
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,427
What a doll.

526
00:51:17,923 --> 00:51:21,239
Yes, I think it would accessorize
the outfit beautifully.

527
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:25,851
What do you think?
Does it make you drool?

528
00:51:25,955 --> 00:51:29,752
I would have picked exactly
the same one. That is my taste.

529
00:51:29,859 --> 00:51:32,641
Yeah? Do you like
this one better?

530
00:51:32,739 --> 00:51:36,929
- What do you think? Which one do you like better?
- Try it on.

531
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:39,296
- You don't mind sitting here?
- No. I like it.

532
00:51:39,395 --> 00:51:42,395
- Okay. All right. I'll see you later.
- Bye.

533
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:44,866
All right.

534
00:51:49,796 --> 00:51:53,690
- Well, this goes with the color. It's beautiful.
- Something in red?

535
00:51:53,795 --> 00:51:56,478
<i>Well, I think it's something...</i>

536
00:51:58,403 --> 00:52:00,291
<i>It's just... red.</i>

537
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,737
Why don't you just pick one?
I'll never make up my mind.

538
00:52:04,835 --> 00:52:08,184
- Why don't you take them both?
- I can't afford them both.

539
00:52:10,212 --> 00:52:12,099
I can.

540
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:15,359
Oh. You do that
too easy.

541
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:18,111
You always buying things
for the ladies?

542
00:52:18,211 --> 00:52:22,554
- No. Not in a long time.
- Kiss her good-bye, shithead.

543
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,609
It's a stickup.

544
00:52:27,715 --> 00:52:29,690
- Call security.
- Oh, really?

545
00:52:29,795 --> 00:52:31,474
Just dial, dipshit!

546
00:53:00,259 --> 00:53:02,648
We're being robbed
and beaten!

547
00:53:13,283 --> 00:53:15,584
Oh!

548
00:53:15,683 --> 00:53:17,985
Out of my way, bitch!

549
00:53:27,427 --> 00:53:29,401
I'm very hard to fit.

550
00:53:31,491 --> 00:53:34,273
- This way!
- No, this way!

551
00:53:34,371 --> 00:53:36,258
We're finished
shopping!

552
00:53:48,707 --> 00:53:51,576
Yeah? Well, come up with something!

553
00:53:51,683 --> 00:53:55,577
If it was possible, Luigi,
and I'm not so sure it is...

554
00:53:55,683 --> 00:53:58,171
it's gonna take a lot of work
to pull this thing off.

555
00:53:58,275 --> 00:54:02,137
- A lot of planning.
- Look. We get a floor plan.

556
00:54:02,243 --> 00:54:05,341
We buy ourselves
an inside man and we go.

557
00:54:05,443 --> 00:54:07,865
Our boy not only told me
where it is...

558
00:54:07,971 --> 00:54:12,827
he told me they're moving it to a federal
depository for safekeeping next Tuesday.

559
00:54:12,931 --> 00:54:16,673
- Oh, Jesus. This is crazy!
- Look, last week in New York...

560
00:54:16,771 --> 00:54:19,706
$10 million won'th of cocaine
walked out of a police station.

561
00:54:19,811 --> 00:54:23,870
- Nobody knows where the hell it is! It can be done.
- That was inside work.

562
00:54:23,971 --> 00:54:28,062
I'm talking
a major fucking job here!

563
00:54:28,163 --> 00:54:31,774
It'll make Brinks
look like rolling a drunk.

564
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:35,453
There's 50 cops in that building any hour of
the day. How you gonna get 'em outta there?

565
00:54:35,555 --> 00:54:37,824
Give 'em tickets
to the ball game?

566
00:54:40,803 --> 00:54:42,625
A bomb.

567
00:54:47,779 --> 00:54:50,234
Just blow the place up, huh?

568
00:54:53,314 --> 00:54:55,202
The genius.

569
00:54:56,194 --> 00:54:58,234
What are you
talking about?

570
00:54:58,339 --> 00:55:02,495
Bomb threat. Whenever they get one,
they have to evacuate the whole building.

571
00:55:02,595 --> 00:55:06,141
<i>Yeah, sure.
If they believe it.</i>

572
00:55:06,243 --> 00:55:09,855
They get that shit all the time.
How you gonna guarantee they'd bite?

573
00:55:09,955 --> 00:55:11,842
Make them nervous.

574
00:55:11,939 --> 00:55:16,478
Make them believe someone is trying
to blow up every police station in the city.

575
00:55:33,507 --> 00:55:36,507
- Hey! Where you going?
- Filling the vending machine.

576
00:55:36,611 --> 00:55:39,361
- Where's Bobby?
- Ha! That's what the boss would like to know.

577
00:55:39,459 --> 00:55:41,825
Hey, you guys bigger on
potato or corn chips?

578
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,606
The guys in the 6th don't touch the corn.

579
00:55:44,706 --> 00:55:48,569
- 9th District, Sergeant Mora.
- Myself, I don't care, you know.

580
00:55:50,691 --> 00:55:52,862
<i>Okay, lady. Where are you?</i>

581
00:55:52,963 --> 00:55:55,352
<i>Anybody hurt?</i>

582
00:55:55,459 --> 00:55:58,307
<i>All right. Someone will be out
over there in a little while.</i>

583
00:56:41,379 --> 00:56:44,575
Well, it doesn't look like
they intended too much damage.

584
00:56:44,674 --> 00:56:47,522
There's always the chance
the guy was a bad bomb maker.

585
00:56:48,995 --> 00:56:52,290
- What're you doing here, Harry?
- Oh, just hoping that some...

586
00:56:52,387 --> 00:56:55,202
half-assed, pro-life,
whale-loving terrorist didn't do it...

587
00:56:55,299 --> 00:56:59,041
so the bureau doesn't have to get involved,
and we can leave it in your good hands.

588
00:56:59,139 --> 00:57:02,138
- Hmm.
- It's crude. It's very crude.

589
00:57:02,243 --> 00:57:04,130
How are ya, Harry?

590
00:57:06,019 --> 00:57:09,728
Hello, Marvin. Yeah, I'm getting better.
How about yourself?

591
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:13,820
- Well, complaining doesn't make any difference, huh?
- Come get a shot of this.

592
00:57:13,923 --> 00:57:16,028
So, what do you figure
this was?

593
00:57:16,131 --> 00:57:19,392
Well, he thinks somebody was mad
at the vending machine.

594
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:22,076
Uh, look, you two kibbutz
somewhere else.

595
00:57:22,178 --> 00:57:24,764
- You're impeding criminal science.
- Yes, yes, right.

596
00:57:24,867 --> 00:57:27,485
So, how goes
your Patrovita case?

597
00:57:27,587 --> 00:57:29,409
I find new angles
every day.

598
00:57:29,507 --> 00:57:32,670
Believe me, he'll run out of options
before we run out of patience.

599
00:57:32,771 --> 00:57:35,324
- I already have.
- Nobody can blame you.

600
00:57:35,427 --> 00:57:37,249
Somebody said
they took you off this case.

601
00:57:37,347 --> 00:57:41,537
Well, they don't control
all the hours of my day.

602
00:57:41,635 --> 00:57:46,010
Don't mess around, Harry. We might have
something working that you don't know about.

603
00:57:46,114 --> 00:57:50,555
My guess is that whatever
you've got working... won't work.

604
00:57:50,659 --> 00:57:52,481
We're doing all we can.

605
00:57:52,579 --> 00:57:54,750
Great. So am I.

606
00:57:54,851 --> 00:58:00,034
I know with you it's personal, but we're
both after the same thing... justice.

607
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:02,753
Right, Harry?
Justice.

608
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:05,501
Fuck justice!

609
00:58:07,971 --> 00:58:10,392
<i>Allow me.</i>

610
00:58:10,499 --> 00:58:12,735
There you go.

611
00:58:12,835 --> 00:58:14,657
<i>I don't really
want to lose you</i>

612
00:58:14,755 --> 00:58:16,860
<i>But I don't want to go</i>

613
00:58:18,658 --> 00:58:21,920
What's new on
the domestic front?

614
00:58:22,019 --> 00:58:24,986
I don't have the report
typed out yet.

615
00:58:25,091 --> 00:58:28,636
<i>I can tell the way they act
and their attitude</i>

616
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:32,448
Remember that horse we used to look at?
I bought it.

617
00:58:32,546 --> 00:58:34,750
What's on your mind, Max?

618
00:58:34,851 --> 00:58:36,673
You.

619
00:58:36,771 --> 00:58:39,160
What can he do for you
I can't?

620
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:41,754
This was your idea,
not mine.

621
00:58:41,858 --> 00:58:44,477
Well, I didn't expect it
to go this far.

622
00:58:44,578 --> 00:58:46,520
How far has it gone?

623
00:58:47,906 --> 00:58:50,426
Does he climb into your pants
five times a day?

624
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:52,353
Is that what you wanna hear?

625
00:58:52,451 --> 00:58:55,484
Not really.
I'd like to know it was me.

626
00:58:55,586 --> 00:59:00,671
The only way you'll ever end up lying next
to me is if we're run down by the same car.

627
00:59:02,978 --> 00:59:04,833
I like it when
you hurt me, baby.

628
00:59:04,931 --> 00:59:07,681
Myself...

629
00:59:07,778 --> 00:59:10,266
I'd rather give
than receive.

630
00:59:10,371 --> 00:59:12,705
Wrong.

631
00:59:12,803 --> 00:59:15,967
<i>Ever think about
ever settling down</i>

632
00:59:16,066 --> 00:59:18,433
Max...

633
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:22,687
I don't think we're going to be
the kind of pals I hoped we'd be.

634
00:59:24,867 --> 00:59:26,689
<i>If a tear rolls from my eyes</i>

635
00:59:26,787 --> 00:59:28,729
<i>I feel the hurt inside</i>

636
00:59:28,834 --> 00:59:31,168
<i>As I reach out to you</i>

637
00:59:31,266 --> 00:59:33,655
I'm impressed.

638
00:59:33,763 --> 00:59:35,705
I'm hungry.

639
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,981
<i>I can't get out
You see, I'm tied</i>

640
00:59:38,082 --> 00:59:43,003
<i>- The more we know each other,
the less you wanna see me.</i>

641
00:59:43,107 --> 00:59:46,587
Is this an approach you developed yourself,
or something you read in a book?

642
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:49,146
These guys from the dress shop
are going to be back...

643
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,639
and I don't want you around
when they do.

644
00:59:58,627 --> 01:00:00,514
I like you.

645
01:00:02,658 --> 01:00:05,047
Maybe more than you like me.
I don't know.

646
01:00:06,819 --> 01:00:10,431
Unless you're gonna tell me you're married
or something, I'm not staying away.

647
01:00:18,883 --> 01:00:20,705
You're married?

648
01:00:20,803 --> 01:00:23,421
For a long time.

649
01:00:32,418 --> 01:00:34,241
Where is she?

650
01:00:34,338 --> 01:00:36,477
Far away from here.

651
01:00:40,738 --> 01:00:42,626
Well...

652
01:00:43,618 --> 01:00:45,440
that's a relief.

653
01:00:45,538 --> 01:00:47,360
I thought I lost it.

654
01:00:47,458 --> 01:00:50,328
All this great equipment,
and you're sitting on your hands.

655
01:00:50,434 --> 01:00:53,750
I was telling myself, "He's a slow starter,
but it gets hot when he gets going. "

656
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:56,793
You're important to me.
You are a friend.

657
01:00:56,899 --> 01:00:58,971
<i>- You're more than a friend.
- "Friend. "</i>

658
01:00:59,074 --> 01:01:02,587
<i>- You're more than that.
- We're friends.</i>

659
01:01:04,067 --> 01:01:06,488
When I wanna make friends,
I'll go to summer camp.

660
01:01:18,051 --> 01:01:20,287
You wanna hear
something funny?

661
01:01:21,283 --> 01:01:23,552
I was sort of flattered.

662
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:26,400
I thought you were going slow because
you thought this was real important...

663
01:01:26,499 --> 01:01:28,408
and you didn't
wanna blow it.

664
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:41,120
It's gonna take me a long time to figure out
which of us is the biggest asshole.

665
01:01:51,011 --> 01:01:54,589
<i>God! They don't make 'em like that anymore.</i>

666
01:01:56,066 --> 01:01:57,953
<i>Whoo!</i>

667
01:02:05,826 --> 01:02:07,768
The whole thing
could blow up.

668
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:10,689
- Patrovita's gonna get Lamanski.
- Mmm.

669
01:02:10,786 --> 01:02:14,364
As long as they keep cutting down
the right people, I don't give a shit.

670
01:02:14,466 --> 01:02:18,078
Patrovita wants the money and the dope
the cops got when they raided him.

671
01:02:18,179 --> 01:02:20,001
And he's gonna try
and get it.

672
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:21,986
You're kidding.

673
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:27,585
You know what happens
if we stop this?

674
01:02:27,683 --> 01:02:31,643
Yeah. Since I'm the new boy,
they must figure that I'm the leak.

675
01:02:31,746 --> 01:02:35,161
Let 'em have it.
This is not the reason we're in this.

676
01:02:35,267 --> 01:02:39,129
- What about Lamanski?
- Considering how we're involved in this...

677
01:02:39,234 --> 01:02:41,056
I can't be of much
help to you, Mark.

678
01:02:41,154 --> 01:02:44,220
You're gonna have to
watch out for yourself.

679
01:02:45,602 --> 01:02:47,490
You want out?

680
01:02:53,794 --> 01:02:55,736
I started to call Amy
last night.

681
01:02:55,842 --> 01:02:58,231
- I wanted her to know that I'm still alive.
- Dangerous.

682
01:02:58,338 --> 01:03:00,924
Yeah. But I've
put her through a lot.

683
01:03:01,026 --> 01:03:04,801
But if we stop now,
the whole thing is for nothing.

684
01:03:04,898 --> 01:03:07,167
And knowing Amy...

685
01:03:07,266 --> 01:03:09,917
she probably
will kill me herself.

686
01:03:14,883 --> 01:03:16,770
Are you gonna stick?

687
01:03:19,714 --> 01:03:22,616
This Joey has
a pretty good life.

688
01:03:22,722 --> 01:03:27,130
Expensive clothes,
a nice car...

689
01:03:27,234 --> 01:03:30,104
lots of money
and free time.

690
01:03:32,034 --> 01:03:34,238
I never had it so good.

691
01:03:36,194 --> 01:03:38,234
Just don't let it go
to your head, all right?

692
01:03:43,202 --> 01:03:45,024
That's kind of sudden.

693
01:03:45,122 --> 01:03:46,944
You don't work good
on short notice?

694
01:03:47,042 --> 01:03:49,409
Nothing works
if it isn't thought out.

695
01:03:49,506 --> 01:03:51,546
They hit the 3rd District
in an hour.

696
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:54,171
We'll waste Lamanski
as a diversion.

697
01:03:54,274 --> 01:03:56,162
It's my idea.

698
01:03:57,346 --> 01:03:59,899
What do you think?

699
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:01,977
I'll let you know
when it's over.

700
01:04:20,515 --> 01:04:22,402
We're ready.

701
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:35,873
3rd District,
Sergeant Washington.

702
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:41,055
You've got a bomb
inside the building.

703
01:04:41,154 --> 01:04:45,016
It goes off in 22 minutes.

704
01:04:47,139 --> 01:04:49,026
All right.
Everything's jammed.

705
01:04:57,506 --> 01:04:59,578
We have a bomb.

706
01:04:59,682 --> 01:05:01,656
Call Bomb Disposal.

707
01:05:01,762 --> 01:05:04,512
Clear the building.

708
01:05:12,130 --> 01:05:14,018
Bomb Disposal.

709
01:05:16,195 --> 01:05:20,602
Evacuate and barricade a perimeter
of 300 feet from the building.

710
01:05:20,706 --> 01:05:22,561
We're on the way.

711
01:05:22,658 --> 01:05:24,481
We're go.

712
01:05:24,578 --> 01:05:26,521
So are we.

713
01:05:28,323 --> 01:05:31,639
<i>Clear those people! Come on!</i>

714
01:05:39,586 --> 01:05:41,474
<i>Come on. Let's keep moving.</i>

715
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,871
Come on, come on, come on!
Let's go!

716
01:05:46,146 --> 01:05:48,732
Let's go! Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

717
01:05:50,755 --> 01:05:54,715
Watch out! Watch where you're going!

718
01:05:54,818 --> 01:05:58,746
- Come on! Come on!
- Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

719
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:02,872
It's right down here.

720
01:06:05,059 --> 01:06:07,612
Torch!

721
01:06:08,962 --> 01:06:10,620
<i>Come on!</i>

722
01:06:19,618 --> 01:06:21,505
You see him?
Lamanski.

723
01:06:23,202 --> 01:06:25,853
<i>Take him when he's clear.</i>

724
01:06:29,378 --> 01:06:31,767
<i>Shit! No way.</i>

725
01:06:31,874 --> 01:06:33,696
Where the fuck did all
those people come from?

726
01:06:33,794 --> 01:06:35,583
Maybe they play bingo.

727
01:06:35,682 --> 01:06:39,260
Do you own a calendar, Max?
I bet it's a Jewish holiday.

728
01:06:39,363 --> 01:06:42,494
<i>Yeah, well, for his sake,
it better be the Day of Atonement.</i>

729
01:06:42,594 --> 01:06:44,569
We'll follow him
and take him when we can.

730
01:07:08,962 --> 01:07:12,159
<i>All right. That's it.
He's ready. Outta here.</i>

731
01:07:12,259 --> 01:07:14,146
We're set.

732
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:21,858
Oh, shit.

733
01:07:23,618 --> 01:07:25,822
That's good.

734
01:07:25,922 --> 01:07:27,929
Guys, we're on the clock.

735
01:07:29,922 --> 01:07:33,119
- Come on.
- Here, fill this one.

736
01:07:49,538 --> 01:07:52,353
<i>When we get to the expressway,
I'm gonna run him off the road.</i>

737
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:54,589
Their car is much
heavier than ours.

738
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:56,862
Wort matter
if you hit the driver.

739
01:09:26,082 --> 01:09:28,384
Run 'em into the wall.

740
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:31,225
Let's get outta here!

741
01:10:38,402 --> 01:10:41,217
<i>Wave your hands!</i>

742
01:10:48,098 --> 01:10:51,676
- Let's go, let's go.
- This is it. Let's make it look good.

743
01:10:52,098 --> 01:10:54,171
Open the doors!

744
01:10:54,242 --> 01:10:56,064
- Clear!
- What happened in there?

745
01:10:56,162 --> 01:10:58,267
Stay clear!

746
01:11:19,362 --> 01:11:21,434
I don't know who in the hell
this guy is.

747
01:11:21,538 --> 01:11:24,986
- I've never seen him before.
- No mistake?

748
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:29,946
Come on. Three years ago,
I busted Joey Brenner twice in two weeks.

749
01:11:30,946 --> 01:11:32,834
And that ain't him.

750
01:11:35,298 --> 01:11:37,186
You know where he is?

751
01:11:38,178 --> 01:11:40,153
Caribbean, I heard.

752
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:48,799
When do you go back
to Miami?

753
01:11:48,897 --> 01:11:51,003
In an hour.

754
01:11:53,634 --> 01:11:57,212
I've got a charity softball game with
Dade County Sheriffs in the morning.

755
01:11:57,314 --> 01:12:00,096
Cops against cops.

756
01:12:00,194 --> 01:12:02,528
You leave me no one
to root for.

757
01:12:05,442 --> 01:12:07,351
So what the fuck are you
doing for the money?

758
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:11,003
- Sticking my ass out.
- Not far enough!

759
01:12:12,226 --> 01:12:15,390
Somebody got somebody inside.

760
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:17,759
He's walking
all over the place.

761
01:12:17,858 --> 01:12:20,508
He's even been to my house.

762
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:23,065
He could be banging my wife,
for Christ's sake!

763
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:26,519
He didn't get by me.
I don't know how the hell he got there.

764
01:12:26,626 --> 01:12:28,960
What the hell's the difference?
We got him, right?

765
01:12:29,058 --> 01:12:31,775
Don't give me that "we" shit!
Max turned him up on his own.

766
01:12:31,874 --> 01:12:34,874
What do you want?
I can't tell you things I don't know about.

767
01:12:34,977 --> 01:12:37,596
Well, what do
you know about?

768
01:12:39,265 --> 01:12:41,305
You're telling me
about this bureau creep...

769
01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:44,028
who's trying to take me apart
in his spare time...

770
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:47,839
because his kid got smacked
when we took Marcellino.

771
01:12:47,938 --> 01:12:50,491
So what's the good news?

772
01:12:50,593 --> 01:12:54,074
I had a friend at the bureau
check Harry Shannors case files.

773
01:12:54,177 --> 01:12:57,974
Whatever he's doing is unofficial.
There aren't any records.

774
01:12:59,585 --> 01:13:04,342
If he were killed, there could be
no direct connection to you.

775
01:13:06,561 --> 01:13:10,784
Oh. That's the good news, huh?

776
01:13:10,882 --> 01:13:13,599
So who's gonna do it?
You?

777
01:13:16,418 --> 01:13:18,305
Brenner.

778
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:24,959
Yeah.

779
01:13:27,265 --> 01:13:29,087
I think I'd better
get going.

780
01:13:29,185 --> 01:13:31,673
Yeah? Where?
Canada? Mexico?

781
01:13:31,778 --> 01:13:34,428
You're not getting out of my sight
until this is over and done.

782
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:38,589
If you did some serious damage
to my organization...

783
01:13:38,689 --> 01:13:41,340
I wanna know where
I can lay my hands on you.

784
01:14:02,081 --> 01:14:03,903
I'll be right back.

785
01:14:04,001 --> 01:14:07,297
- Hey! We can't be late!
- Just a minute!

786
01:14:09,602 --> 01:14:11,424
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

787
01:14:11,522 --> 01:14:13,726
Sorry for the other night.

788
01:14:13,826 --> 01:14:17,655
<i>- Where would I learn how to deal with a friend?
- It's okay.</i>

789
01:14:17,762 --> 01:14:20,151
<i>Let's go!</i>

790
01:14:20,258 --> 01:14:22,330
I was thinking
maybe we could talk.

791
01:14:22,434 --> 01:14:24,768
I have
something to do.

792
01:14:24,865 --> 01:14:27,582
<i>- Maybe later?
- Sure.</i>

793
01:14:27,682 --> 01:14:29,821
<i>Take my car and go home.</i>

794
01:14:29,921 --> 01:14:33,718
I'll call you as soon
as I get back. Okay?

795
01:14:44,577 --> 01:14:46,465
Watch yourself.

796
01:14:47,522 --> 01:14:50,304
Don't worry.

797
01:15:52,322 --> 01:15:55,802
<i>- You gonna tell me who it is?
- A cop.</i>

798
01:15:55,906 --> 01:15:58,011
Just a fucking cop.

799
01:15:59,298 --> 01:16:01,240
Go straight at him.

800
01:16:01,346 --> 01:16:03,385
I'll take the far side.

801
01:16:23,169 --> 01:16:26,617
<i>Wherefore my heart is glad
and my spirit rejoices...</i>

802
01:16:26,722 --> 01:16:30,300
<i>my flesh also shall
rest in hope.</i>

803
01:16:30,402 --> 01:16:32,736
<i>Thou shalt show me
the path oflife.</i>

804
01:16:32,834 --> 01:16:35,517
<i>In thy presence
is the fullness ofjoy,;</i>

805
01:16:35,618 --> 01:16:39,993
<i>and at thy right hand
there is pleasure for evermore.</i>

806
01:16:40,097 --> 01:16:42,814
<i>In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection and eternal life...</i>

807
01:16:42,913 --> 01:16:45,466
through our Lord
Jesus Christ...

808
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:49,628
<i>we commend to Almighty God
our brother, William Dunne...</i>

809
01:16:49,729 --> 01:16:51,933
<i>and we commit his body
to the ground,;</i>

810
01:16:52,034 --> 01:16:56,703
earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

811
01:16:56,801 --> 01:16:58,940
<i>The Lord bless him,
keep him.</i>

812
01:16:59,041 --> 01:17:01,463
The Lord make his face
to shine upon him...

813
01:17:01,569 --> 01:17:03,904
<i>and be gracious upon him.</i>

814
01:17:05,857 --> 01:17:07,832
- Harry!
- Waste him!

815
01:17:30,530 --> 01:17:32,864
Harry, I didn't know it was you.

816
01:17:32,962 --> 01:17:35,296
That's all right.

817
01:17:35,394 --> 01:17:38,710
- Go on and get out of here.
- I'm gonna get the ambulance for you.

818
01:17:38,818 --> 01:17:41,021
It'll come.
Now you go on, beat it.

819
01:17:41,121 --> 01:17:43,325
If the cops take you
and I don't make it...

820
01:17:43,426 --> 01:17:45,433
you'll be years
explaining this.

821
01:17:45,538 --> 01:17:47,360
Harry, don't die.

822
01:17:47,458 --> 01:17:49,661
<i>- It's not over.
- Then go on.</i>

823
01:17:49,761 --> 01:17:51,768
Go on, get out of here.
Beat it.

824
01:17:51,873 --> 01:17:54,623
- I'll see you soon, okay? I'll see you.
- Go on!

825
01:18:22,113 --> 01:18:24,896
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Saving your ass.

826
01:18:47,873 --> 01:18:50,775
Okay. Pack whatever
you can't live without.

827
01:18:50,882 --> 01:18:53,118
Go to the Rock Falls Airport
and charter a plane.

828
01:18:53,217 --> 01:18:55,356
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

829
01:18:55,457 --> 01:18:58,523
To do what an old friend
asked me to do...

830
01:18:58,625 --> 01:19:00,512
knock 'em dead.

831
01:19:10,753 --> 01:19:13,120
<i>Did I mention the pit?</i>

832
01:19:13,218 --> 01:19:16,633
<i>Yeah, that's the gravel pit.
It's owned by Patrovita.</i>

833
01:19:16,737 --> 01:19:18,909
<i>You get an invitation,
don't go.</i>

834
01:19:19,009 --> 01:19:22,358
<i>Busting rocks is only some
of what goes on out there.</i>

835
01:22:03,681 --> 01:22:06,137
We got company.

836
01:22:07,201 --> 01:22:09,568
Which way?
I don't see nothing.

837
01:22:11,649 --> 01:22:14,169
<i>I can't get no</i>

838
01:22:14,273 --> 01:22:17,372
<i>Satisfaction</i>

839
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:21,467
I can't get no

840
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:23,871
Satisfaction

841
01:22:23,969 --> 01:22:26,969
'Cause I try, and I try

842
01:22:27,073 --> 01:22:31,296
And I try, and I try

843
01:22:31,393 --> 01:22:33,597
I can't get no

844
01:22:33,697 --> 01:22:37,014
I can't get no

845
01:22:37,121 --> 01:22:39,674
<i>When I'm driving in my car</i>

846
01:22:39,777 --> 01:22:43,738
And a man
comes on the radio

847
01:22:43,841 --> 01:22:47,583
<i>He's telling me
more and more</i>

848
01:22:47,681 --> 01:22:51,423
<i>- About some useless information
- Billy, outside! Let's go!</i>

849
01:22:51,521 --> 01:22:54,336
<i>Supposed to fire
my imagination</i>

850
01:22:54,433 --> 01:22:57,335
<i>I can't get no</i>

851
01:22:57,441 --> 01:23:00,191
No, no, no

852
01:23:00,289 --> 01:23:02,590
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

853
01:23:02,689 --> 01:23:05,056
<i>That's what I say</i>

854
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:11,901
I can't get no

855
01:23:12,002 --> 01:23:15,035
Satisfaction

856
01:23:15,138 --> 01:23:18,553
<i>I can't get no</i>

857
01:23:18,657 --> 01:23:20,926
Satisfaction

858
01:23:21,025 --> 01:23:24,254
'Cause I try, and I try

859
01:23:24,353 --> 01:23:27,866
And I try, and I try

860
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:30,588
I can't get no

861
01:23:30,689 --> 01:23:32,577
I can't get no

862
01:23:33,921 --> 01:23:37,304
When I'm watching my TV

863
01:23:37,409 --> 01:23:41,119
And a man
comes on and tells me

864
01:23:41,217 --> 01:23:44,217
<i>How white my shirts
can be</i>

865
01:23:44,321 --> 01:23:46,394
But he can't be a man

866
01:23:46,497 --> 01:23:49,596
'Cause he doesn't smoke
the same...

867
01:25:55,361 --> 01:25:57,662
What exactly happened here
is unclear.

868
01:25:57,729 --> 01:26:01,559
Police speculate, based on the amount
of heroin and money found on the scene...

869
01:26:01,665 --> 01:26:03,934
this may be the result
of a brewing mob war.

870
01:26:04,033 --> 01:26:05,921
Mob war my ass!

871
01:26:06,913 --> 01:26:09,182
Brenner!

872
01:26:09,281 --> 01:26:12,248
We don't know where
the son of a bitch is.

873
01:26:12,353 --> 01:26:14,175
Let's hope
he's not alive.

874
01:26:14,273 --> 01:26:17,535
From the looks of that mess,
I'd say he was dead.

875
01:26:17,633 --> 01:26:19,455
I think he's right.

876
01:26:19,553 --> 01:26:21,561
Don't think, pray!

877
01:26:21,665 --> 01:26:24,087
If he's still alive,
you're not!

878
01:26:25,089 --> 01:26:28,504
Oh, shit!

879
01:26:31,809 --> 01:26:35,835
- Let's get him before he gets us! The elevators!
- Give me an extra clip.

880
01:26:35,937 --> 01:26:38,555
You! Stick around.

881
01:26:54,017 --> 01:26:55,872
Hold it, hold it,
hold it, hold it!

882
01:26:58,049 --> 01:27:00,024
Eh?

883
01:27:14,849 --> 01:27:16,507
<i>What?</i>

884
01:27:16,608 --> 01:27:19,292
<i>Move!</i>

885
01:27:23,297 --> 01:27:25,304
Get down!

886
01:28:10,593 --> 01:28:12,829
Shit!

887
01:28:17,281 --> 01:28:18,775
He got me!

888
01:28:34,657 --> 01:28:36,828
Oh, shit!

889
01:28:43,681 --> 01:28:45,568
<i>Come on!</i>

890
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,240
<i>Come on!</i>

891
01:29:08,064 --> 01:29:09,952
Fuck!

892
01:29:23,969 --> 01:29:25,529
Damn it!

893
01:29:32,129 --> 01:29:34,332
Oh, damn it!

894
01:29:39,392 --> 01:29:41,814
- Come on!
- Get the son of a bitch!

895
01:29:47,169 --> 01:29:49,919
<i>Come on, man!
Just you and me!</i>

896
01:29:50,017 --> 01:29:52,886
<i>Come on!
Show yourself!</i>

897
01:30:06,113 --> 01:30:07,935
- Now what?
- Call the cops.

898
01:30:08,033 --> 01:30:10,106
<i>- What?
- Call the fucking cops!</i>

899
01:30:16,961 --> 01:30:20,256
For God's sakes, let it...

900
01:31:06,273 --> 01:31:08,095
Kaminski?

901
01:31:08,193 --> 01:31:11,935
This must be what they mean
by "poetic justice. "

902
01:31:14,209 --> 01:31:16,958
This is... isn't what you think.
I'm with the government.

903
01:31:17,057 --> 01:31:19,807
I set every one
of these guys up, and...

904
01:31:19,904 --> 01:31:23,549
So, back with the bureau, huh?
I didn't know that.

905
01:31:23,649 --> 01:31:25,688
It's, uh...

906
01:31:25,793 --> 01:31:28,892
You know, that whole thing
was such a mistake. You and I...

907
01:31:28,992 --> 01:31:32,254
Because of you,
a lot of people are dead.

908
01:31:32,353 --> 01:31:34,425
And now it's your turn.

909
01:31:34,529 --> 01:31:37,911
No. No.

910
01:31:43,681 --> 01:31:47,259
Resign or be prosecuted.

911
01:31:47,361 --> 01:31:49,270
Any way you want it.

912
01:32:13,537 --> 01:32:15,195
Excuse me.
We're coming through.

913
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:18,080
<i>Pardon me.</i>

914
01:32:19,329 --> 01:32:21,816
<i>Shit!</i>

915
01:32:23,137 --> 01:32:24,959
<i>All right.
Careful. Careful. Watch it.</i>

916
01:32:25,057 --> 01:32:27,926
- Okay, Lenny.
- They said you got room for one more, right?

917
01:32:28,033 --> 01:32:31,164
<i>- Watch your back.
- What do you think Baxter was doing here?</i>

918
01:32:31,265 --> 01:32:34,167
Until I know different,
I gotta assume our leak's just been plugged.

919
01:32:34,272 --> 01:32:36,956
- Pardon the pun.
- What the hell you think happened here?

920
01:32:39,553 --> 01:32:41,375
I think somebody
got very pissed off.

921
01:32:41,473 --> 01:32:44,571
- Who?
- I got a good idea.

922
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:47,639
Baker, just got a location on the car.

923
01:32:47,745 --> 01:32:52,830
- Give it to me.
- A 1979 Oldsmobile registered to Luigi Patrovita...

924
01:32:52,928 --> 01:32:54,751
moving south on Route 84.

925
01:32:54,848 --> 01:32:56,671
- Should they intercept?
- No. Negative.

926
01:32:56,768 --> 01:32:59,736
- Tell them to track him. Keep
me up on where he is. - Ten-four.

927
01:33:01,825 --> 01:33:04,061
Where are you going?

928
01:33:04,161 --> 01:33:06,582
I'm gonna see
how smart I am.

929
01:33:31,809 --> 01:33:33,881
Get on the plane.

930
01:33:33,984 --> 01:33:35,871
You okay?

931
01:33:43,584 --> 01:33:46,584
- You're not going, are you?
- No.

932
01:33:46,688 --> 01:33:48,511
Then I'm not either.

933
01:33:48,608 --> 01:33:50,845
You're out of excuses,
sweetheart.

934
01:33:50,945 --> 01:33:53,214
There's a quarter million dollars
in that bag.

935
01:33:53,313 --> 01:33:56,062
Win or lose,
it's your choice.

936
01:33:56,161 --> 01:33:58,233
Now get out of here.

937
01:34:01,696 --> 01:34:03,584
You'll be okay,
won't you?

938
01:34:14,337 --> 01:34:16,890
Get going.

939
01:35:11,424 --> 01:35:13,312
I'm glad you didn't
make me chase you.

940
01:35:13,409 --> 01:35:16,059
Too damn tired.

941
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:20,022
That doesn't surprise me. A hundred years
of police work in a single afternoon.

942
01:35:21,312 --> 01:35:23,679
<i>Always figured
you were one of us.</i>

943
01:35:27,297 --> 01:35:29,631
How many days in a row...

944
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:34,107
do I have to haul
your butt down here?

945
01:35:34,208 --> 01:35:36,030
Hmm?

946
01:35:36,128 --> 01:35:38,681
Just to watch you
do nothing.

947
01:35:38,784 --> 01:35:40,856
I have no interest...

948
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:44,408
in becoming
an accomplished cripple.

949
01:35:44,512 --> 01:35:48,309
Now you push me back to my room
or out into traffic. I don't give a shit.

950
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:51,391
Things not so good, Harry?

951
01:35:55,936 --> 01:35:58,719
- I've seen better days.
- Wanna see 'em again?

952
01:35:58,816 --> 01:36:01,151
Wort happen from down here.

953
01:36:04,097 --> 01:36:07,512
So, you used to being back
with the bureau?

954
01:36:07,616 --> 01:36:09,624
Sure.

955
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:11,550
And back with my wife.

956
01:36:11,648 --> 01:36:13,536
Thank you very much.

957
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,873
Come on, Mark!
Stop fooling around!

958
01:36:18,976 --> 01:36:20,864
Give me...
Give me my chair.

959
01:36:23,456 --> 01:36:25,278
I need your help, Harry.

960
01:36:25,376 --> 01:36:27,383
For what?
Where's my chair?

961
01:36:27,489 --> 01:36:30,391
My reunion with Amy
was a big success.

962
01:36:32,352 --> 01:36:34,261
We just found out
that she's pregnant.

963
01:36:34,368 --> 01:36:36,190
That's great.
That's great.

964
01:36:36,288 --> 01:36:38,044
Give me my chair.

965
01:36:38,145 --> 01:36:40,795
I don't know anything
about being a father, Harry.

966
01:36:40,896 --> 01:36:43,263
I want your help.
I want you to be the godfather.

967
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:45,815
All right. I'll help.
Now give me the goddamn chair!

968
01:36:45,921 --> 01:36:48,637
- Then walk.
- I can't walk!

969
01:36:48,736 --> 01:36:51,736
Then meet me halfway.
Come on.

970
01:36:51,841 --> 01:36:54,394
I don't have to walk
to be a godfather!

971
01:36:54,496 --> 01:36:57,693
You don't have to walk,
but you have to try like hell.

972
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:05,846
- I can't!
- Did you ever quit in front of Blair?
