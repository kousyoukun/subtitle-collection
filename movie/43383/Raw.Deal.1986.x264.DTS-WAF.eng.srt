Then I'm not either.

2108
01:38:03,693 --> 01:38:05,983
You're out of excuses,
sweetheart.

2109
01:38:06,109 --> 01:38:08,485
There's a quarter million dollars
in that bag.

2110
01:38:08,568 --> 01:38:11,443
Win or lose,
it's your choice.

2111
01:38:11,568 --> 01:38:13,694
Now get out of here.

2112
01:38:17,319 --> 01:38:19,320
You'll be okay,
won't you?

2113
01:38:30,530 --> 01:38:33,156
Get going.

2114
01:38:44,741 --> 01:38:46,575
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

2115
01:39:29,958 --> 01:39:31,916
I'm glad you didn't
make me chase you.

2116
01:39:32,041 --> 01:39:34,792
Too damn tired.

2117
01:39:34,917 --> 01:39:38,918
That doesn't surprise me. A hundred years
of police work in a single afternoon.

2118
01:39:40,252 --> 01:39:42,752
<i>Always figured
you were one of us.</i>

2119
01:39:46,503 --> 01:39:48,962
How many days in a row...

2120
01:39:50,420 --> 01:39:53,588
do I have to haul
your butt down here?

2121
01:39:53,713 --> 01:39:55,588
Hmm?

2122
01:39:55,713 --> 01:39:58,422
Just to watch you
do nothing.

2123
01:39:58,463 --> 01:40:00,589
I have no interest...

2124
01:40:00,714 --> 01:40:04,339
in becoming
an accomplished cripple.

2125
01:40:04,423 --> 01:40:08,381
Now you push me back to my room
or out into traffic. I don't give a shit.

2126
01:40:09,632 --> 01:40:11,591
Things not so good, Harry?

2127
01:40:16,341 --> 01:40:19,217
- I've seen better days.
- Wanna see 'em again?

2128
01:40:19,342 --> 01:40:21,759
Wort happen from down here.

2129
01:40:24,844 --> 01:40:28,385
So, you used to being back
with the bureau?

2130
01:40:28,552 --> 01:40:30,636
Sure.

2131
01:40:30,761 --> 01:40:32,636
And back with my wife.

2132
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:34,720
Thank you very much.

2133
01:40:38,095 --> 01:40:40,221
Come on, Mark!
Stop fooling around!

2134
01:40:40,345 --> 01:40:42,263
Give me...
Give me my chair.

2135
01:40:45,013 --> 01:40:46,889
I need your help, Harry.

2136
01:40:47,014 --> 01:40:49,098
For what?
Where's my chair?

2137
01:40:49,223 --> 01:40:52,223
My reunion with Amy
was a big success.

2138
01:40:54,265 --> 01:40:56,266
We just found out
that she's pregnant.

2139
01:40:56,391 --> 01:40:58,266
That's great.
That's great.

2140
01:40:58,391 --> 01:41:00,225
Give me my chair.

2141
01:41:00,308 --> 01:41:03,100
I don't know anything
about being a father, Harry.

2142
01:41:03,184 --> 01:41:05,642
I want your help.
I want you to be the godfather.

2143
01:41:05,767 --> 01:41:08,310
All right. I'll help.
Now give me the goddamn chair!

2144
01:41:08,435 --> 01:41:11,268
- Then walk.
- I can't walk!

2145
01:41:11,393 --> 01:41:14,519
Then meet me halfway.
Come on.

2146
01:41:14,603 --> 01:41:17,227
I don't have to walk
to be a godfather!

2147
01:41:17,394 --> 01:41:20,729
You don't have to walk,
but you have to try like hell.

2148
01:41:26,147 --> 01:41:29,147
- I can't!
- Did you ever quit in front of Blair?

2149
01:42:04,903 --> 01:42:06,737
[Chuckles]

2150
