1060
01:37:13,461 --> 01:37:15,283
I need your help, Harry.

1061
01:37:15,381 --> 01:37:17,388
For what?
Where's my chair?

1062
01:37:17,494 --> 01:37:20,396
My reunion with Amy
was a big success.

1063
01:37:22,357 --> 01:37:24,266
We just found out
that she's pregnant.

1064
01:37:24,373 --> 01:37:26,195
That's great.
That's great.

1065
01:37:26,293 --> 01:37:28,049
Give me my chair.

1066
01:37:28,150 --> 01:37:30,800
I don't know anything
about being a father, Harry.

1067
01:37:30,901 --> 01:37:33,268
I want your help.
I want you to be the godfather.

1068
01:37:33,365 --> 01:37:35,820
All right. I'll help.
Now give me the goddamn chair!

1069
01:37:35,926 --> 01:37:38,642
- Then walk.
- I can't walk!

1070
01:37:38,741 --> 01:37:41,741
Then meet me halfway.
Come on.

1071
01:37:41,846 --> 01:37:44,399
I don't have to walk
to be a godfather!

1072
01:37:44,501 --> 01:37:47,698
You don't have to walk,
but you have to try like hell.

1073
01:37:52,981 --> 01:37:55,851
- I can't!
- Did you ever quit in front of Blair?

1074
01:38:30,133 --> 01:38:31,956

1075
01:38:32,053 --> 01:38:33,941
