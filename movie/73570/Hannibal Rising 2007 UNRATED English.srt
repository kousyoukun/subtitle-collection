{1023}{1090}Quick! This way!
{1133}{1185}Quickly!
{1415}{1480}Down to the lake.
{2067}{2189}- M... for Mischa.|- Mischa.
{2275}{2355}Come on!|Come on, let's go!
{2499}{2561}Come on, Lothar.
{2567}{2643}- Hurry now. Give me the bathtub.|- Yes, sir.
{2689}{2754}Hannibal,|Mischa, where have you been?
{2757}{2837}Hurry now!|Quickly!

{3359}{3425}Come along.|Come on.
{3432}{3471}Hey.
{3474}{3548}Colonel Timka says the fighting|will be close to the roads.
{3551}{3604}Can't last more than a few days.
{3607}{3648}We'll be safe at the lodge.
{3651}{3692}Go on!
{3695}{3770}We're almost there!
{3853}{3916}No, no, no, no. The bath|has to be for the dirty...
{3919}{3954}- Yes, madame.|- In you come.
{3957}{3980}Take this.
{3983}{4011}Let's see if our toys|are still there.
{4014}{4062}- Ah, hand me the bathtub.|- I'll take care of that, sir.
{4065}{4132}No, no. It's fine.|But let's hurry.
{4135}{4211}Cook will have finished packing|the kitchen by the time you get back.
{4339}{4404}Mischa...
{4417}{4537}Hannibal, give them here.|Mama's pearls...
{4715}{4766}Pearls before swine...
{4859}{4941}Mischa... blow.
{6249}{6309}Shut up.|Shut up!
{6427}{6512}You are a Jew.|How could I eat your cooking?
{6515}{6574}Dispose of him.
{6604}{6692}How do you deal with locals,|being locals yourself?
{6695}{6798}You say you want to be SS.|Let's see you earn it.
{6887}{6924}Kill the Jew.
{6927}{6997}Bring me the peasant.
{7019}{7093}Move! Move!
{7096}{7194}Move, you fat fucking Jew!|Move! Move!
{7302}{7333}Are you a gypsy?
{7336}{7412}No, sir.
{7579}{7633}Are you a Jew?
{7656}{7697}No, sir.
{7700}{7827}Milko. Good job!

{7954}{7993}Major!
{7996}{8028}Russian tanks moving west!
{8031}{8072}Put all their food|on the trucks.
{8075}{8150}Move it!
{8385}{8465}This forest was full of game.
{8470}{8526}This war...
{8623}{8699}Find us something|to eat, Lothar.
{8833}{8900}Which way home, Hannibal?
{9039}{9095}Good boy.
{9243}{9322}The Germans are falling back|from Leningrad.
{9327}{9388}They are in full retreat.
{9391}{9550}Freezing... and starving.
{9897}{9966}What's that?
{10141}{10170}Tank! A Russian tank!
{10173}{10263}- Get away from the window.|- Lothar! Russians!
{10515}{10610}Everybody out of the house!
{10895}{11008}We only want water.|The children can stay in the warm.
{11011}{11081}- Get them inside.|- Go on. Look after Mischa.
{11084}{11113}Come here.
{11116}{11179}Start the pump.
{11471}{11530}Wait here.
{11551}{11580}Mama!
{11583}{11627}Mama!
{11661}{11710}How much longer|with the pump?
{11713}{11762}A few minutes.

{15663}{15701}Come on!|Run, run, run, run, run!
{15704}{15752}Start the engine.
{15755}{15802}I told you, Grutas,|we're going to die!
{15805}{15860}Relax, we're getting rich.
{15863}{15916}- In! In, in, in!|- Come on, come on!
{15919}{15963}- Faster, faster!|- Go!
{15981}{16062}Grutas,|isn't that the SS Major?
{16149}{16237}Major?|Kill a few gypsies, you said.
{16240}{16322}Kill a few Jews,|and they'll make you SS.
{16325}{16372}If you had kept your word,
{16375}{16477}I would be saying|"yes, sir" to you now.
{16491}{16611}But now... I am|in business for myself.
{16821}{16849}He's not one of ours!
{16852}{16908}Kill him!
{17020}{17078}Russians!
{17148}{17216}Get the body.|Hurry!
{17295}{17356}Don't kill the dead ones,|stupid.
{17376}{17454}Find the weapons.|Find the weapons!
{17630}{17714}Go. Go, go, go.|All in.
{17748}{17797}Come on, come on,|come on.
{17891}{17989}Dump the body!|Dump the body immediately!
{19016}{19088}They're shooting looters.
{19091}{19150}Stop and black out.
{19578}{19645}Move back!
{19713}{19737}Don't shoot!
{19740}{19798}Come on!
{19964}{19987}Come on.
{19990}{20041}- Put it down.|- Drop it now, you little fuck!
{20044}{20089}Put it down!
{20092}{20124}Or we shoot her.
{20127}{20162}Give me that.
{20165}{20223}Get the radio, Kolnas.
{20495}{20583}We're lucky. Only kids.
{20596}{20661}If a patrol comes by...
{20664}{20726}we saved them...
{20768}{20801}and their family's stuff.
{20804}{20837}Hey, Dortlich.
{20840}{20876}Grentz, check the door.
{20879}{20926}Pot watcher.
{20929}{20969}Check upstairs.
{20972}{21025}Find some food.
{21075}{21193}Hey, only rotten potatoes.
{21330}{21437}Find something.|Try the... try the Germans.
{21681}{21740}Listen,|I need information, you idiot.
{21743}{21784}It's not a fucking toy.
{21787}{21879}Wait, I have found something|under Russian frequency.
{22059}{22102}Roadblocks.
{22105}{22190}Every five kilometers|from here to Vilnius.
{22239}{22346}So, we're stuck for now?
{22663}{22720}Once we were Lithuanian.
{22723}{22756}Now we are Russians.
{22759}{22825}We were Germans before.
{22847}{22880}Medics.
{22883}{22907}Police.
{22910}{22979}And what are we|at this moment?
{23003}{23062}At this moment,|we are starving.
{23065}{23112}Did you get something?
{23115}{23140}Freezing out there.
{23143}{23191}Open it.
{23231}{23289}You think these are|peppercorns?
{23292}{23347}These are frozen maggots.
{23350}{23434}This was rotten|before it froze!
{23663}{23700}I'll put this in your head!
{23703}{23751}Stop it, Grutas.
{24443}{24524}The boy is Hannibal Lecter...
{24563}{24673}...and the little girl is Mischa.
{25415}{25468}We eat...
{25483}{25532}...or die.
{27529}{27581}Let's hear you, little master.
{27584}{27635}He's a mute.
{27638}{27674}He's not mute at night.
{27677}{27748}He can scream well enough,|and he'll sing.
{27751}{27828}This is not|your father's house anymore.
{27831}{27879}It's the People's Orphanage,
{27882}{27973}and you're just|one more orphan.
{27988}{28115}Lecter!|I'll see you in my office!
{28343}{28453}Hannibal, you do not honor|the human pecking order.
{28456}{28523}You're always hurting|the bullies.
{28579}{28608}I know,
{28611}{28694}this was your mother's room.
{28697}{28781}Must be difficult for you|to live in this house.
{28834}{28878}Go to bed.
{28911}{28978}Go to bed!
{29187}{29258}Everything all right?
{29645}{29689}No, please.
{29812}{29856}Mischa!
{29897}{29941}Get up!
{30081}{30152}Now, scream all you please.
{30318}{30372}Every day,|you'll pay for this.
{30375}{30510}Every day for the rest|of your short and nasty life.
{33296}{33351}Lecter!
{33399}{33446}He's not here.
{33464}{33510}This way.
{34651}{34702}Okay!
{35848}{35898}Boy!
{38581}{38616}Who's there?
{38619}{38642}Some help you are.
{38645}{38698}Shoo! Go!
{38797}{38836}What is it, Serge?
{38839}{38869}A boy, madame.
{38872}{38954}He has pictures of you|and your husband.
{39805}{39861}Your uncle would have loved|to see you, Han.
{39864}{39980}It has been almost a year|since he died.
{40209}{40283}Only you and I are left now.
{40484}{40535}Mischa.
{40601}{40675}Mischa. Mischa.
{40749}{40805}Mischa.
{41008}{41084}Mischa! Mischa!
{41087}{41136}Mischa! Mischa!
{41139}{41172}Hannibal.
{41175}{41202}- Mischa!|- Hannibal.
{41205}{41276}Hannibal! Hannibal!|Wake up!
{41279}{41354}It's all right.|It's all right.
{41418}{41519}When you sleep,|do you remember?
{41532}{41611}Do you remember|what happened to Mischa?
{42204}{42278}You look like your uncle,|Hannibal.
{42376}{42433}Would you like to try?
{42436}{42487}Use this.
{42865}{42946}Hannibal!
{43843}{43898}Speak to me.
{44042}{44098}Thank you.
{45535}{45590}Hannibal.
{45860}{45920}Here is where I pray|to my ancestors
{45923}{46015}for strength, for courage.
{46094}{46201}I have the honor|only on my ancestor's birthday
{46204}{46245}to polish his armor
{46248}{46323}with oil of cloves.
{46675}{46784}This is after the fight|for Osaka Castle.
{46935}{47046}The samurai display|the heads of their enemies.
{47056}{47174}There are more suitable parchments|that will interest you.
{47227}{47269}Be gentle, Hannibal.
{47272}{47327}And be brave.
{47351}{47410}Like your father.
{47465}{47522}And like him.
{47747}{47801}You must be ready|for anything.
{47804}{47850}Come.
{47937}{47981}Again.
{48060}{48113}Again.
{48217}{48252}Good.
{48255}{48317}- Again.|- All right.
{49383}{49424}Hey, japonaise.
{49427}{49496}Hey, japonaise!
{49499}{49582}Monsieur, please.
{49607}{49659}- Is that all, madame?|- Yes.
{49667}{49728}Hey, japonaise,|tell me the truth.
{49731}{49796}Does your pussy run crossways?
{49799}{49901}With a puff of straight hairs|like a little explosion?
{49947}{49992}Hannibal!
{50136}{50182}Don't move.
{50438}{50476}The butcher tried|to get the knife
{50479}{50569}while stating he would|kill everyone in the market.
{50573}{50627}Well...
{50630}{50693}The butcher... was Vichy,
{50696}{50778}a collaborator|with the German occupation.
{50781}{50810}He's much hated.
{50813}{50890}And I can deal with him.
{51072}{51114}Young man...
{51117}{51165}if you're to be a doctor,
{51168}{51220}you must be careful|with your hands.
{51223}{51259}No more fighting,
{51262}{51338}and never give more|than a single pass.
{51723}{51760}Forgive me.
{51763}{51838}I came now to seek revenge.
{51843}{51920}Hannibal needs peace.
{55417}{55511}If you've pissed in my fuel tank,|I'll twist your head off!
{55523}{55610}Paul Momund, the butcher.
{55623}{55687}You owe a certain lady an apology.
{55690}{55748}Apologize to la japonaise?
{55751}{55834}Boy, you must be crazy to come here.|I'll throw you in the river.
{55837}{55888}Or maybe I'll split your pants
{55891}{55938}and give you something|you don't want
{55941}{55981}where you don't want it.
{55984}{56093}You inquired about her...|pussy.
{56096}{56184}You speculated|it ran which way?
{56187}{56230}Jap pussy runs crossways.
{56233}{56334}You should fuck that little Jap|and see for yourself?
{56349}{56395}Crossways like that?
{56719}{56799}Or more tangential|to the spine?
{57174}{57254}Do you see how your mouth|stains the air?
{57257}{57332}I should add that|to my drawing.
{57335}{57398}Would you like to see it?
{58600}{58656}Wait for me.
{58753}{58796}You see, it was made|with a single blow.
{58799}{58878}Ah, Inspector Popil.|I'm very happy you could come.
{58881}{58940}You won't remember me,|but I was with the...
{58943}{59000}Of course. You delivered|De Rais to Nuremburg
{59003}{59033}and sat behind him.
{59036}{59098}I saw you bring|the evidence.
{59107}{59155}It's an honor, sir.
{59178}{59258}- What do we have here?|- Paul Momund, or most of him.
{59261}{59310}You have his dossier.
{59313}{59356}Yes.
{59359}{59392}Fat and ugly.
{59395}{59479}He shipped Jews|from Marseille.
{59499}{59540}He fought recently.
{59543}{59578}And often.
{59581}{59668}Last Saturday night, a bar fight.|He had many enemies.
{59671}{59750}A list, please.|His recent opponents.
{59761}{59799}You've done nothing|to this body?
{59802}{59846}Oh, no, no, no, monsieur.|No, no.
{59849}{59884}The chief specifically...
{59887}{59914}The odor,
{59917}{59982}it's not of anything|you use here?
{59985}{60042}It smells like|that toothache remedy.
{60045}{60097}Yes, oil of cloves.
{60100}{60156}Let's see the pharmacist.
{60195}{60242}Look.
{60245}{60338}The most exquisite bits|of the fish are the cheeks.
{60341}{60384}This is true|for many creatures.
{60387}{60462}When carving at the table,|you give one cheek to madame,
{60465}{60504}the other to the|guest of honor.
{60507}{60534}Did you hear?
{60537}{60636}They haven't found the butcher's|damned ugly head yet.
{62691}{62771}Good evening, my lady.
{62878}{62914}I hope you don't mind.
{62917}{63066}I would've used a butcher's knife,|but the sword seemed so appropriate.
{63326}{63418}Not a nick in the blade,|I promise you.
{63475}{63540}The butcher was like butter.
{64087}{64159}You didn't need to|do this for me.
{64162}{64238}Rudeness is epidemic,|my lady.
{64397}{64446}Police.
{64561}{64622}They will call it murder.
{64636}{64706}At worst,|a crime of passion.
{64815}{64864}Wash your hands.|Quickly.
{64867}{64923}Go!
{64983}{65055}Inspector Pop-il?
{65058}{65135}- Popil, madame.|- Popil.
{65183}{65236}Hannibal Lecter?
{65255}{65303}Good evening.
{65306}{65400}You fought with the butcher,|Paul Momund, in the market.
{65419}{65471}Now he is dead.
{65486}{65548}I must ask you|to come along with me.
{65620}{65698}Is your name|Hannibal Lecter?
{65703}{65760}Yes.
{65817}{65915}Do you have any guilty knowledge|of the death of Paul Momund?
{65919}{65954}Guilty knowledge?
{65957}{66037}Limit your responses|to yes or no.
{66086}{66137}No.
{66249}{66302}It's vanilla.
{66316}{66378}He reacts to nothing.
{66421}{66477}It's monstrous.
{66584}{66637}The butcher had been fishing.
{66640}{66740}There was blood and scales|on his knife, but no fish.
{66743}{66809}The tape tells you|all that?
{66821}{66874}Remarkable.
{66896}{66946}No.
{66950}{67044}The chef told me you brought|a splendid fish in for dinner.
{67047}{67103}Where did you get that fish?
{67106}{67151}By fishing, Inspector.
{67154}{67245}We keep a baited line in the water|behind the boathouse.
{67248}{67312}I'll show you if you like.
{67315}{67384}My specialty is war crimes.
{67403}{67492}And I know they|do not end with the war.
{67499}{67564}You lost your entire family.
{67576}{67625}So did I.
{67628}{67741}And for you, your beautiful aunt came|and made up for it all.
{67751}{67837}The very scent of her must have|taken away the smell of the camp.
{67840}{67917}So when Paul the butcher|spewed filth at her,
{67920}{67998}I can understand|if you killed him.
{68003}{68061}Tell me what happened, Hannibal.
{68104}{68149}Together we could|show a court there was...
{68152}{68258}The very scent of her|takes away the smell of the camp.
{68279}{68328}Do you compose verse,|Inspector?
{68331}{68396}And keep it|under your pillow?
{68878}{68992}Now, tell me, Inspector,|did you choose war crimes...
{68999}{69052}...because you lost family|in the war?
{69055}{69104}Yes.
{69107}{69158}How?
{69179}{69241}Some in combat,|some were shipped east.
{69244}{69284}Did you catch who did it?
{69287}{69340}No.
{69355}{69408}But they were Vichy,|men like the butcher?
{69411}{69455}Yes.
{69496}{69560}Then we are both suspects.
{69563}{69642}I can say you were|fishing with me, if you like.
{69714}{69778}Inspector,|you should see this.
{69819}{69895}I told you...|keep these people away.
{70066}{70113}- It's the butcher?|- Yes, sir.
{70116}{70140}How long?
{70143}{70215}Ten minutes.|No longer.
{70796}{70865}Wait here, please.
{70935}{71058}Madame, so sorry to disturb you.|I was passing with the papers.
{71061}{71175}Your legal residency|in France is threatened, madame.
{71178}{71216}We can delay the death duties
{71219}{71272}so you can stay in the house|for the time being,
{71275}{71377}but inevitably, the state will take it|and sell it at auction.
{71380}{71429}You will have to|let the staff go.
{71432}{71477}Good night.
{71705}{71795}Father, Mother...
{71811}{71928}I'm the youngest student they've|ever admitted into medical school.
{71938}{71986}It's a work scholarship.
{71989}{72069}I think you would be pleased.
{72103}{72172}Death duties on|my uncle's estate
{72175}{72265}have finally forced the sale|of the chateau.
{72268}{72356}Lady Murasaki will|leave for Paris with me.
{72547}{72644}This work scholarship means|I must spend much of my spare time
{72647}{72734}preparing bodies|for the anatomy class.
{72796}{72846}My studies are fascinating
{72849}{72922}and absorb me completely.
{73021}{73108}Yet I still find myself thinking|about my sister
{73111}{73151}and the men who|took her from me.
{73154}{73223}Let me go!
{73303}{73404}Do you suppose God|intended to eat Isaac?
{73425}{73510}That's why he told|Abraham to kill him.
{73520}{73552}Eat him?
{73555}{73608}Of course not.
{73611}{73702}The Angel intervenes in time.
{73746}{73800}Not always.
{73951}{74022}I have to know about Mischa.
{74100}{74150}I can see their faces|in my dreams,
{74153}{74261}but I can't remember what they called|each other with their bloody mouths.
{74307}{74387}I would give anything|to remember.
{74463}{74514}Hannibal...
{74519}{74636}Memory is a knife.|It can hurt you.
{75202}{75267}I want to stay|here with you.
{75281}{75370}No.|You must stay at school.
{75853}{75917}Louis,|I need you to remember.
{75920}{76011}Who told the Nazis|where the children were hidden?
{76014}{76074}You must remember.
{76103}{76190}I can't bear to think|about it.
{76202}{76259}This will help you remember.
{76303}{76350}Hannibal Lecter.
{76353}{76410}What are you doing here?
{76413}{76449}The body.
{76452}{76504}I'm a medical student now.
{76507}{76580}Yes, I know.|I have followed your progress.
{76583}{76658}You repeat nothing|you hear in this room.
{76744}{76787}Please, Louis...
{76790}{76848}Klaus Barbie shipped|the children to Auschwitz.
{76851}{76900}Who told him where the|children were hidden?
{76903}{76962}Did you tell him?
{77011}{77143}When they broke my fingers,|I gave them Pardou.
{77183}{77285}Pardou knew where|the children were hidden.
{77357}{77432}He's mayor of Belleville now.
{77496}{77525}Thank you, Louis.
{77528}{77560}Inspector.
{77563}{77595}Yes?
{77598}{77670}Where were the police?
{78082}{78187}No, no, no.|Please, please.
{78599}{78666}You knew at once|what Louis wanted, didn't you?
{78669}{78759}His crucifix to remain with|his brain, not his heart.
{78762}{78859}He answered your question,|but you didn't answer his.
{78862}{78989}Where were the police when the Nazis|threw the children into the trucks?
{81274}{81335}Hannibal!
{81712}{81769}Come and play.
{81786}{81849}One little cheek.
{81883}{81926}Two little cheeks.
{81929}{81978}Cough.
{82018}{82060}She has pneumonia.
{82063}{82119}Let's take her.
{82131}{82198}She's going to die anyway.
{82521}{82580}Hannibal!
{82908}{82959}Come on!
{82963}{83044}- Get out!|- Grutas. wait!
{83058}{83108}The dog tags.
{83119}{83151}Come on!
{83154}{83246}Pot watcher!|Hurry!
{86329}{86376}Passport.
{86706}{86782}- Student?|- Yes.
{86842}{86908}You need a new photograph.
{87261}{87306}Da.
{87501}{87548}Night report.
{87561}{87627}Entry visas for Kaunas.
{88123}{88175}Lecter.
{89078}{89139}The lodge.
{92698}{92762}"Kolnas."
{92790}{92839}"Grutas."
{93320}{93380}Mischa.
{93806}{93864}Herr Dortlich...
{93867}{93987}On behalf of myself|and my late family,
{93990}{94066}I thank you for coming.
{94077}{94150}Do you remember the bathtub|bubbling on the stove?
{94153}{94264}She was dead anyway,|I swear she was.
{94520}{94609}So much mayonnaise,|Herr Dortlich.
{95110}{95150}Where are the others?
{95153}{95235}I don't know.
{95676}{95754}Yes, I know where one of them is,|Grentz. I know Grentz.
{95757}{95780}Grentz?
{95783}{95859}In Canada. He got out on the|refugee boat from Bremerhaven.
{95862}{95898}What did he look like?
{95901}{95945}Swarthy.
{95948}{96010}They wouldn't have let|him in the SS!
{96013}{96077}Oh, yes, of course.
{96080}{96146}He's the one that|always provided the bowl.
{96149}{96203}What about Milko?
{96206}{96270}All dead, all dead.
{96273}{96313}In the war.
{96316}{96385}I remember his singing.
{96424}{96526}And now, your leader Grutas.
{96555}{96637}I don't know, I don't know,|I don't know, please!
{96640}{96760}Please let me go, and I will|testify against Grentz.
{97007}{97125}Do you remember "Das M�nnlein|im Walde," Herr Dortlich?
{97236}{97310}Mischa loved that song.
{97334}{97392}Let's sing for Mischa.
{97715}{97751}You're not singing.
{97754}{97822}Sing for slack, Herr Dortlich.
{97825}{97891}Sag...
{98152}{98238}It's Kolnas!|Kolnas deals with him!
{98312}{98374}Deals with him.
{98638}{98698}And where is Kolnas?
{98754}{98813}Fontainebleau.
{99510}{99593}Purpurroten M�ntelein, indeed.
{101184}{101313}Picked some wild mushrooms|and made a brochette.
{101353}{101450}Mushrooms and cheeks.
{102621}{102682}Where have you been?
{102819}{102923}You smell of smoke and blood.
{103295}{103358}Where did you go?
{103405}{103459}I found them.
{103503}{103569}The men who killed Mischa.
{103579}{103661}I have the names.
{103689}{103756}They're here in France.
{103792}{103836}Where?
{103866}{103919}Fontainebleau.
{104397}{104451}Ortolans.
{104499}{104611}He nets them on their way|to Africa and serves them for lunch.
{104614}{104693}They're like us...|they smell the others cooking,
{104696}{104776}and still they try to sing.
{104985}{105053}Kolnas is using|the name of "Kleber".
{105056}{105110}It's on the license.
{105124}{105222}Monsieur Kleber,|residing Rue Juliana.
{105308}{105359}Morning, how are you?
{105372}{105419}Oh, look.
{105422}{105474}Here he is.
{105477}{105572}Come by on his way to church|to check the till.
{105598}{105695}How neat he is,|and plump, this...
{105716}{105772}...war criminal.
{106810}{106885}Do you know that song?
{107076}{107113}Where's Natalya?
{107116}{107173}Where is she?
{107184}{107242}She's always wandering off.
{107245}{107311}Come, come.|Come!
{107333}{107394}We need to go to church.
{107422}{107506}Hannibal, he has children.
{107522}{107600}She's wearing|Mischa's bracelet.
{107646}{107737}Choose your offering|for the church.
{107765}{107840}Good.|Put it in your pocket?
{107843}{107898}Ah, the shiny one.
{107901}{107979}We'll put it safe in...
{108122}{108180}What is it?
{109263}{109333}- Evening.|- They're waiting for you down below.
{109336}{109410}I called my|Soviet friends.
{109438}{109498}Dortlich's dog tag|was in his mouth.
{109501}{109579}That means that he has|all of our dog tags
{109582}{109663}- and the pot watcher's inventory.|- No, no.
{109666}{109767}Dortlich searched|those ruins before?
{109770}{109840}Grutas told him to do it.
{109843}{109917}Poked around with his picnic fork,|the lazy bastard.
{109920}{109960}Who is he?
{109963}{110036}Who is he, this...|poisoned little boy
{110039}{110095}who killed Dortlich?
{110098}{110147}He's a Paris schoolboy.
{110150}{110215}They say that there is|a passport photograph,
{110218}{110252}but they don't have it yet.
{110255}{110301}What's his name?
{110356}{110406}Hannibal Lector.
{110542}{110587}You know him?
{110617}{110655}So do you.
{110658}{110814}We... we had dinner with him|during the war.
{110863}{110957}Go back to your|restaurant, Kolnas.
{111099}{111186}Bring me a covered dish|next time.
{111320}{111381}Where the hell is Dieter?
{111400}{111427}Dieter!
{111430}{111555}You bruise their face, you split|their lip, the money goes down.
{111558}{111602}Come here.
{111642}{111692}And that one...
{111695}{111752}that one is mine,|for now.
{111755}{111804}I didn't do it!
{111807}{111863}Milko, I want you|to go to Paris.
{111866}{111955}Kolnas found me|a B�sendorfer piano, the best.
{111958}{112008}Oh, and...
{112011}{112048}find the boy.
{112051}{112098}Lector.
{112101}{112178}You know what to do|with him.
{112467}{112515}Thanks.
{113249}{113291}Inspector Popil.
{113294}{113338}Please come in.
{113341}{113442}This is...|not a social call.
{113566}{113621}- Where is he?|- I don't know.
{113624}{113679}At medical school,|I think.
{113682}{113744}Did you ever see|this man?
{113895}{113939}No.
{113981}{114029}His name's Dortlich.
{114032}{114081}He's a war criminal.
{114084}{114165}He was found near|the castle Hannibal came from.
{114168}{114240}Dortlich had some|ugly friends.
{114258}{114326}I want to know|where they are.
{114334}{114386}Hannibal may know.
{114847}{114905}Don't cut yourself.
{115103}{115158}I know about you.
{115168}{115239}I know you lost|your family, everything,
{115242}{115323}when the bomb fell|on Hiroshima.
{115446}{115483}Yes.
{115486}{115589}You protect Hannibal|because he lost everything, too?
{115607}{115670}That is your bond with him?
{115696}{115828}Do you see your family|in your dreams, Inspector?
{115859}{115910}Yes.
{115942}{115994}So do I.
{116017}{116083}So does he.
{116294}{116363}If your pet snake|strikes in France,
{116366}{116490}I will have to seize him, and|he will die under the guillotine.
{121995}{122040}Sorry.
{122425}{122486}It was Grutas who|sent you to kill me.
{122489}{122560}No, not to kill.
{122599}{122646}To give you money.
{122649}{122726}Let me give it to you.
{122950}{122990}No!
{122993}{123044}No!
{123047}{123117}No!
{123550}{123610}- You killed so many, Milko.|- No!
{123613}{123702}Many more than these.
{123721}{123806}Do you feel them|in the tank around you?
{123928}{123979}We ate...
{123997}{124091}...we ate 12.
{124138}{124190}Grutas was very quick.
{124193}{124253}She felt nothing!
{124261}{124335}So, Grutas has a house.
{124338}{124381}Where?
{124610}{124677}I have difficulty|hearing you.
{124680}{124762}He has a house...
{124846}{124876}No!
{124879}{124917}All right, all right.
{124920}{125007}Milly-la-Foret.
{125094}{125147}No, no, no!
{125150}{125230}She felt nothing.
{126251}{126316}No, please!
{126324}{126370}No!
{126539}{126592}Oh, Inspector Popil.
{126595}{126665}What a surprise.
{126806}{126862}Found in your room.
{126898}{126963}If you kill in France...
{126966}{127052}I will see your head|in a bucket.
{127075}{127152}Do you mind if I work|while we talk?
{127195}{127314}You killed Dortlich in the woods|where your family died.
{127346}{127399}His face had been eaten.
{127402}{127448}I would suspect the ravens.
{127451}{127532}Ravens who made|a shish kebab?
{127562}{127614}Cannibalism.
{127649}{127715}It happened on the|eastern front.
{127718}{127810}But you know that, don't you?|You were there.
{127901}{127961}This is not the face|of your subject.
{127964}{128060}This is the face of Vladis Grutas,|like the pictures in your room.
{128063}{128118}Did you kill him, too?
{128162}{128190}No, I didn't.
{128193}{128261}Have you found him?
{128283}{128386}If I found him, I give you my word|I would bring him to your attention.
{128389}{128449}Don't fool with me.
{128476}{128559}Did you know he sawed off|the head of the rabbi at Kaunas?
{128562}{128618}He shot gypsy children|in the woods.
{128621}{128660}He walked free at Nuremberg
{128663}{128758}because a witness got|acid poured down her throat.
{128813}{128852}I'll need your deposition.
{128855}{128911}Come with me.
{129126}{129176}Let's begin.
{129339}{129390}Put it down...
{129403}{129439}...or I'll shoot her.
{129442}{129524}Grutas has|the eyes of an arctic wolf.
{129527}{129657}He knew at once to threaten Mischa|to make me put down the spear.
{129675}{129715}At first...
{129718}{129798}they needed us for cover|in case troops found them.
{129801}{129855}Later...
{129858}{129917}they crowded around...
{129920}{129999}feeling our cheeks and arms.
{130110}{130177}Hold her head still.|Hold her head still!
{130180}{130214}Mischa!
{130217}{130243}Hold it still.
{130246}{130317}Not in here, boss.|Not in here.
{130490}{130564}Hannibal!
{131235}{131274}I promised Mischa.
{131277}{131363}Promised to make them|pay a pound of flesh?
{131366}{131440}To pay skin for skin?
{131478}{131524}If they had killed you...
{131527}{131585}who would punish them then?
{131590}{131707}The answer is "me."|I will.
{131775}{131830}If you swear to share|what you know with me...
{131833}{131895}then I will let you go.
{131908}{131976}I swear.
{131990}{132046}Jacques...
{132229}{132291}He knows something.
{132343}{132434}He'll lead us to Grutas,|then we'll arrest him.
{132467}{132527}The court has to|declare him insane.
{132530}{132635}Then in the asylum, the doctors|can study him and find out what he is.
{132638}{132744}The little-boy-Hannibal|died in 1944 out in that snow.
{132816}{132903}His heart died with Mischa.
{132906}{132979}What he is now...
{132982}{133055}there's no word for it...
{133070}{133152}...except "monster".
{134063}{134148}Give these men|to the police.
{134151}{134234}It's Kolnas's children,|isn't it?
{134237}{134301}No.
{134675}{134736}Promise me.
{134903}{134959}Hannibal!
{134971}{135019}I can't.
{135098}{135185}I can't.|I already promised Mischa.
{139134}{139178}Get out.
{139232}{139317}Give us your identification.
{139383}{139435}Where is Milko?
{139438}{139499}I don't know,|and I don't give a damn.
{139502}{139560}You paid me|to bring you this piano.
{139563}{139620}Get my bike down.
{140051}{140121}Don't worry.|I won't hit you again.
{140151}{140218}I like you now.
{140365}{140439}Maybe I fix your teeth.
{140755}{140819}I want steam.
{140822}{140881}Turn it up.
{141583}{141644}I'm glad you're here.
{141661}{141744}I always felt|I owed you something.
{141919}{141995}I thought|you would be bigger.
{142005}{142099}I put your face|on every bully I ever hurt.
{142307}{142358}Kill him.
{143033}{143096}Answer me this...
{143099}{143223}Would you have fed me to your|little sister because you loved her?
{143233}{143271}Yes.
{143274}{143334}There.
{143337}{143397}There you have it.
{143400}{143453}Love!
{143460}{143594}I love myself that much, and|I will never apologize to you.
{143622}{143669}Cut him.

{151698}{151754}I'm calling the police.
{151776}{151865}May I get them for you?
{151895}{151941}What did I do to you?
{151944}{152032}Aside from eating|my sister, nothing.
{152038}{152098}Are you wearing your dog tag,|Herr Kolnas?
{152101}{152205}Many people look like me. Are you|sure you have the right person?
{152208}{152297}I was slave labor|for the Nazis in the war.
{152300}{152354}I lost family, too.|I understand.
{152357}{152404}Well, to improve|your understanding,
{152407}{152522}I went by your home|on the Rue Juliana.

{152597}{152693}with the sleeping child.
{152940}{153087}And... I picked up|something for your oven.
{153250}{153322}It's a beef roast, Kolnas.
