1
00:02:14,452 --> 00:02:16,901
This is the roof. Where did she fall
from?

2
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:19,486
Sir, she would've fallen

3
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,369
from around 600-700 feet.

4
00:02:21,536 --> 00:02:23,164
But there aren't any tall buildings
around here.

5
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:24,898
Unless she fell from a plane…

6
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:29,309
So strange.

7
00:02:29,695 --> 00:02:32,226
Sir, air traffic control just
confirmed.

8
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:34,471
No aircraft in the vicinity today.

9
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:38,562
It's… unbelievable.

10
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:40,479
Coroner!

11
00:02:45,356 --> 00:02:46,622
This roof is haunted!

12
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,625
Sir, the Boss.

13
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,822
Yes, Sir?

14
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:04,239
Kau, let them take lead on this.

15
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:24,736
I've told them to clear the scene.

16
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:27,139
Get it done. Quickly.

17
00:04:04,282 --> 00:04:06,013
Step over the fire, everyone.

18
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:08,181
Dragon, pig, dog years. Don't look.

19
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,510
Cousin, a ghost…

20
00:05:00,645 --> 00:05:02,072
I know. Don't look.

21
00:05:04,225 --> 00:05:05,078
Bye.

22
00:05:05,268 --> 00:05:06,408
Wait up!

23
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:18,104
What's up? We're dismissed. Let's
go!

24
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:43,033
Calm down! No flash!

25
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,213
I'm dizzy.

26
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:49,654
That's my entrance.

27
00:05:49,778 --> 00:05:51,726
And what am I?

28
00:05:51,867 --> 00:05:54,640
You brought up your problems
too fast. I can't look cool now.

29
00:05:54,725 --> 00:05:56,773
A girl was looking over here, you know?

30
00:06:02,722 --> 00:06:03,984
If you'd waited,

31
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:06,583
I'd look cooler.

32
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:09,054
But I could feel your nerves.

33
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,273
My nerves?

34
00:06:10,362 --> 00:06:12,726
You're sweating. Your eye is
twitching.

35
00:06:16,664 --> 00:06:20,054
She was looking at me. I was...
flirting. With my eyes.

36
00:06:20,272 --> 00:06:23,179
Fine. Go on with your problems.

37
00:06:23,414 --> 00:06:24,640
That would be cool.

38
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:27,190
I will, or I'll die.

39
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:29,609
If I die, no revenge for you.

40
00:06:33,122 --> 00:06:35,132
That's heavy. What floor is this?

41
00:06:36,515 --> 00:06:38,234
17th, going on 18th.

42
00:06:38,654 --> 00:06:39,927
Must be a Class 3.

43
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:41,114
I say Class 4.

44
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:44,841
We can smell it, 20 levels away.

45
00:06:45,035 --> 00:06:46,364
Must be vicious.

46
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:48,937
Jumped to their death, looks like.

47
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:51,052
So, a flying ghost.

48
00:06:51,913 --> 00:06:54,557
Like you can fly, Mister Cool.

49
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,570
Step aside. Watch me.

50
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:04,044
Careful.

51
00:07:06,585 --> 00:07:07,992
Go do your own thing.

52
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:09,613
Do your own thing

53
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:43,630
Miss…

54
00:07:44,257 --> 00:07:45,166
A ghost!

55
00:07:45,695 --> 00:07:47,307
I'm not the ghost, you are.

56
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,625
Don't worry. You're dead.

57
00:07:50,457 --> 00:07:53,109
Mr. Chan said he'd take me with him.

58
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:55,205
What should I do?

59
00:07:56,223 --> 00:07:58,007
I don't feel hatred in you.

60
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,757
But don't stay here, or you'll
become a hate ghost.

61
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:06,403
My card. Look me up.

62
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:49,010
Dead yet? Die!

63
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,770
Come help me!

64
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,958
You told me to step aside.

65
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:17,440
Vision Drops! His powers are half
gone.

66
00:09:17,609 --> 00:09:20,026
You only have five minutes. Hurry!

67
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,744
Do you believe I can take him in
one?

68
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:11,747
Teacher Chan?

69
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:13,820
You love your student.

70
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,401
But why harm an innocent girl?

71
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:19,268
I'm sorry.

72
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,174
You may not be reincarnated!

73
00:10:44,238 --> 00:10:46,090
Why didn't you do that before?

74
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:48,536
Didn't want to steal your cool.

75
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:54,026
He's watching us. Should we beat him
up?

76
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:08,239
We spend so much on that department,
but why?

77
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,510
I can't see it.

78
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,666
I don't feel any ghosts.

79
00:11:14,031 --> 00:11:16,024
One guy in the whole department,

80
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:19,317
and all he does is blow up satellite
dishes.

81
00:11:19,434 --> 00:11:21,816
No one can watch TV.

82
00:11:21,912 --> 00:11:24,398
We're flooded with phone complaints.

83
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,583
And the coroner's death, too.

84
00:11:26,938 --> 00:11:28,520
What do I tell my bosses?

85
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:30,440
What do I tell the public?

86
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,151
Regular cases are less troublesome.

87
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:37,794
As for this...

88
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,616
I won't sign.

89
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,125
TV's that important?

90
00:11:46,602 --> 00:11:48,156
If it weren't for us,

91
00:11:48,632 --> 00:11:50,716
this could have been much worse.

92
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:55,330
Sir, 2002 needs signatures from all
precinct heads

93
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,640
in order to keep on going.

94
00:11:57,835 --> 00:12:00,171
If you don't sign, it won't be
approved.

95
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:02,515
The others have signed,

96
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:04,778
so it must be useful.

97
00:12:05,473 --> 00:12:07,075
Maybe we can't see them,

98
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,026
but some cases can't be explained by
science.

99
00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:13,406
A one-person department is unusual,

100
00:12:13,604 --> 00:12:16,947
but Inspector Yau communicates with
that world.

101
00:12:17,247 --> 00:12:19,559
If he keeps order in that realm,

102
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:21,276
we don't see a problem.

103
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:22,789
No.

104
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:24,427
I'm not signing it.

105
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:28,098
You say that because you're not the
one with a problem.

106
00:12:28,518 --> 00:12:30,229
I'm in trouble here.

107
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:34,664
I signed it! Leave me alone!

108
00:13:34,858 --> 00:13:35,803
Yau,

109
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:38,315
you've made your point.

110
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,013
Stay away!

111
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,664
Don't blame me.

112
00:13:55,306 --> 00:13:57,848
Have someone change the fluorescent
light.

113
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,246
Good, the chalice!

114
00:14:12,661 --> 00:14:15,309
Lucky number 40. Great!

115
00:14:17,063 --> 00:14:20,994
I know. Sam lost, so he has to go.

116
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,153
I told you that.

117
00:14:23,105 --> 00:14:24,718
When?

118
00:14:25,753 --> 00:14:28,427
You've been partners too long. Time
to let go.

119
00:14:28,512 --> 00:14:30,403
He's the one who wanted to stay.

120
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:32,354
He's got no family, no friends.

121
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:33,932
It's better that he goes.

122
00:14:34,017 --> 00:14:35,266
You're the one

123
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:36,914
with no family or friends.

124
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:38,578
Did you want him to stay?

125
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:41,104
I'm a guy. Why would I want him?

126
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,953
Paper Chan, loan me $3 billion.

127
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:50,369
You gambler, it's never enough.

128
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:51,554
Forget it!

129
00:14:51,697 --> 00:14:53,289
I stopped gambling!

130
00:14:53,988 --> 00:14:56,289
Then get me some girls.

131
00:14:56,687 --> 00:15:00,812
I've given you all kinds.

132
00:15:01,107 --> 00:15:03,395
You can't handle more.

133
00:15:03,868 --> 00:15:06,098
How about a smoke?

134
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,130
Gimme a cigarette?

135
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:10,216
No!

136
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:14,864
What?

137
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:18,210
Okay, fine.

138
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:27,802
Thanks, Boss!

139
00:15:28,398 --> 00:15:30,229
Ignore the wandering ones,

140
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:32,588
you owe me $1.50 for smokes.

141
00:15:33,072 --> 00:15:36,213
It's reincarnation season. Sam will
go anytime

142
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:38,847
You're his friend. Buy from me.

143
00:15:38,932 --> 00:15:40,120
Burn lots of things.

144
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,627
I have the latest, look.

145
00:15:41,752 --> 00:15:43,898
[Missing Chinese dialogue here]

146
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:45,356
China visas.

147
00:15:45,457 --> 00:15:48,911
They need them down there, too. Poor
things.

148
00:15:49,347 --> 00:15:50,565
Well, Boss?

149
00:15:52,123 --> 00:15:53,106
How much?

150
00:15:53,468 --> 00:15:55,734
You know it's just the one price.

151
00:15:56,006 --> 00:15:58,200
$3,888. $3,888?

152
00:15:58,294 --> 00:15:59,169
Excuse me.

153
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:01,382
Miss, can I help?

154
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:03,757
Do you have... candles?

155
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,484
Candles? Yes, hang on.

156
00:16:06,371 --> 00:16:07,533
This kind?

157
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:09,835
Sorry, not this kind.

158
00:16:09,938 --> 00:16:11,419
I mean a Western candle.

159
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:12,752
A candle?

160
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,223
Yes, yes...

161
00:16:14,354 --> 00:16:17,481
First shop on your right.

162
00:16:17,566 --> 00:16:19,015
Thanks. No problem.

163
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,591
Miss…

164
00:16:28,615 --> 00:16:30,398
You again?

165
00:16:30,568 --> 00:16:33,635
A Western uniform, for Western good.

166
00:16:33,822 --> 00:16:35,065
Look around.

167
00:16:35,575 --> 00:16:37,783
Don't follow me.

168
00:16:37,907 --> 00:16:39,528
Watch the other store.

169
00:16:40,497 --> 00:16:42,710
Front door, please.

170
00:16:45,241 --> 00:16:47,388
Ignore him. Look at this.

171
00:16:47,518 --> 00:16:48,950
It's good, thick enough.

172
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,596
Where's paper Chan?

173
00:16:50,868 --> 00:16:52,861
Not here. I'm watching the store.

174
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,486
This is an 8210,

175
00:16:55,584 --> 00:16:57,453
he sold me a 8250.

176
00:16:57,798 --> 00:16:59,984
I don't care, give me the right one.

177
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:01,894
An 8250? Yes.

178
00:17:02,011 --> 00:17:03,004
Let me see.

179
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:10,330
Found it yet?

180
00:17:10,442 --> 00:17:12,127
Quiet. I'm looking.

181
00:17:27,234 --> 00:17:29,018
An 8250? Yes.

182
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:31,460
Here.

183
00:17:31,613 --> 00:17:33,623
See, it's not even the same style.

184
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,085
Chan said it was.

185
00:17:35,526 --> 00:17:36,895
Give me some incense.

186
00:17:37,392 --> 00:17:39,328
Ask the boss.

187
00:17:39,552 --> 00:17:41,320
We're old neighbors,

188
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,057
Chan gives them to me.

189
00:17:43,142 --> 00:17:45,250
Can't do that. I would if I could.

190
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,802
Are you joking?

191
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:50,760
You dare take gifts from him?

192
00:17:50,845 --> 00:17:52,481
You got a death wish?

193
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:54,851
I'll show you. Your hand...

194
00:17:54,936 --> 00:17:56,270
Leave me alone.

195
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:57,786
Let her see.

196
00:17:57,871 --> 00:17:59,825
Look, what is this?

197
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,653
It's the Star of Death.

198
00:18:01,738 --> 00:18:05,390
They say the Star of Death

199
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,945
kills your friends,

200
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,622
family, your spouse.

201
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:13,611
He's fated to be alone.

202
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:17,523
Not only friends! Even colleagues.

203
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,662
Anyone who touches him dies.

204
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,226
You dare take this? You're dead!

205
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,028
Greedy!

206
00:18:26,163 --> 00:18:28,843
So you can't ever date or marry?

207
00:18:28,989 --> 00:18:31,664
Never date. Too dangerous.

208
00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:33,171
But flirting is fine.

209
00:18:33,535 --> 00:18:35,317
Why tell her everything?

210
00:18:35,568 --> 00:18:36,776
I'm going now.

211
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,708
Stay and chat.

212
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:42,661
You're handsome. A cute guy like
you,

213
00:18:42,763 --> 00:18:44,708
you must be something else.

214
00:18:44,962 --> 00:18:45,799
I'm going.

215
00:18:45,939 --> 00:18:48,171
Respect your parents, work hard.

216
00:18:48,256 --> 00:18:49,416
Shut up!

217
00:18:49,697 --> 00:18:51,453
They're dead, okay?

218
00:18:51,636 --> 00:18:53,734
Go home. Go.

219
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:55,574
And don't drop by!

220
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,221
Can I use your Octopus card?

221
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:32,296
Mine ran out.

222
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:34,544
I don't have one.

223
00:19:34,748 --> 00:19:36,215
Loan me $5.

224
00:19:38,225 --> 00:19:40,221
Miss, I have both.

225
00:20:02,455 --> 00:20:03,575
Thanks.

226
00:20:17,207 --> 00:20:19,645
I see you here all the time.

227
00:20:21,868 --> 00:20:25,322
Remember to pay me back. Don't owe
me money.

228
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:32,929
There's no substitute for blood.

229
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:34,796
We need 700 donors every day.

230
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:36,325
I work in the hospital.

231
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,508
A lot of people die in a hospital?

232
00:20:40,898 --> 00:20:42,431
Yes.

233
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,562
About how many?

234
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,523
We average 2.5 deaths per day.

235
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,056
Life is so fragile.

236
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:53,812
So true.

237
00:20:54,757 --> 00:21:01,750
Every time you give blood, you help
3-4 people.

238
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,744
How can I get a tape of that?

239
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:07,405
I wonder.

240
00:21:09,526 --> 00:21:10,400
Yes.

241
00:21:23,243 --> 00:21:24,566
Well, I'm there.

242
00:21:29,857 --> 00:21:33,768
Remember to pay me back.

243
00:21:33,949 --> 00:21:36,197
I will, next time.

244
00:21:47,812 --> 00:21:49,820
Driver, where can I get a tape

245
00:21:49,911 --> 00:21:51,726
of the program you're playing?

246
00:21:55,466 --> 00:21:59,854
Government Warning: Do not speak
to the driver while vehicle is in motion.

247
00:22:00,806 --> 00:22:02,330
You'll kill him!

248
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:05,314
I was just asking.

249
00:22:11,848 --> 00:22:14,403
Miss, I have it.

250
00:22:17,581 --> 00:22:18,458
Crazy!

251
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:27,093
I thought you left.

252
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:29,986
Not without beating you up.

253
00:22:32,301 --> 00:22:33,500
Go ahead.

254
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:40,888
You owe me a shooting, but there's
no gun.

255
00:22:41,817 --> 00:22:44,231
Pay it back in your next life.

256
00:22:49,544 --> 00:22:52,703
I'll burn one for you. Shoot me.

257
00:22:54,444 --> 00:22:56,390
I forgot where you shot me.

258
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,523
I was never angry at you.

259
00:23:00,517 --> 00:23:01,708
We're friends!

260
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:42,661
Your new partner will be here soon.

261
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:10,122
Standard-issue car, no registration.

262
00:24:11,102 --> 00:24:13,825
Your work's so secret, you must be
well-paid.

263
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,799
You looked me up?

264
00:24:18,821 --> 00:24:20,526
I saw the roof incident.

265
00:24:21,098 --> 00:24:22,541
I see spirits, too.

266
00:24:23,694 --> 00:24:25,033
I want to join you.

267
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:26,625
For the pay?

268
00:24:27,102 --> 00:24:30,585
No. I want to give back to society.

269
00:24:32,113 --> 00:24:33,866
He'll match three conditions.

270
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:37,476
One, as with the 18 buddhas,

271
00:24:37,751 --> 00:24:39,700
he'll have 18 gifts for you.

272
00:24:41,495 --> 00:24:43,713
No need to count. It's 18.

273
00:24:44,677 --> 00:24:46,677
Let me join you. I'll cancel them.

274
00:24:46,939 --> 00:24:49,429
A Fortune Star on his shoulder.

275
00:24:50,158 --> 00:24:53,018
In his chart, it's 167.

276
00:24:54,028 --> 00:24:56,567
Not fair? File a complaint.

277
00:24:58,451 --> 00:25:00,195
Three...

278
00:25:00,948 --> 00:25:01,932
Pants down.

279
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:02,979
Why?

280
00:25:03,518 --> 00:25:05,093
If you want a transfer…

281
00:25:14,064 --> 00:25:15,315
You're the one.

282
00:25:15,632 --> 00:25:18,427
I need one who can sacrifice dignity
for ideals.

283
00:25:18,585 --> 00:25:21,223
I can. When do I start?

284
00:25:22,502 --> 00:25:24,549
Soon as you pull your pants up.

285
00:25:26,266 --> 00:25:28,682
A man who knows no shame.

286
00:25:41,277 --> 00:25:43,544
A fire started at a rave.

287
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:46,247
There's a burn victim
with untouched clothing.

288
00:25:46,332 --> 00:25:47,380
Check it out.

289
00:25:48,263 --> 00:25:49,770
Come on!

290
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:51,753
Just like that?

291
00:25:51,838 --> 00:25:52,976
Why not?

292
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:54,398
Put these on.

293
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,010
These are Touch Gloves.

294
00:25:57,095 --> 00:25:58,986
They can touch and hit spirits.

295
00:25:59,566 --> 00:26:00,744
Why are they lined?

296
00:26:04,786 --> 00:26:07,091
Spirit-striking gun, safety off.

297
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:10,388
Clip's in, your blood's in the
bullet.

298
00:26:10,957 --> 00:26:13,085
Just load the chamber, and shoot.

299
00:26:13,795 --> 00:26:14,908
Why blood?

300
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:18,533
Thick needle, easy to lose too much
blood.

301
00:26:21,286 --> 00:26:24,033
Vision Drops, so you can see the
spirits.

302
00:26:24,186 --> 00:26:25,841
That's half a ghost's power,

303
00:26:25,926 --> 00:26:27,950
but you'll only have five minutes.

304
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:30,867
Why five and not six?

305
00:26:31,662 --> 00:26:33,346
How would I know?

306
00:26:33,447 --> 00:26:35,814
Why so many questions? Why are you a
guy?

307
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:37,338
Why are you named Fung?

308
00:26:37,671 --> 00:26:39,385
Why Fung? Dad named me.

309
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,231
Why a guy and not a girl?

310
00:26:41,526 --> 00:26:43,593
Because I have Y chromosomes.

311
00:26:43,756 --> 00:26:46,231
Y, joined with an X, makes a boy.

312
00:26:46,476 --> 00:26:49,494
Why the questions? If I don't know
the answers,

313
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:50,603
I can't work,

314
00:26:50,688 --> 00:26:52,458
and then I get fired.

315
00:26:52,984 --> 00:26:55,695
I'll look up there, you look there.

316
00:26:55,956 --> 00:26:57,111
Don't ask.

317
00:26:58,416 --> 00:26:59,345
Be careful.

318
00:29:33,874 --> 00:29:35,778
Can't you tell it's an illusion?

319
00:29:35,863 --> 00:29:36,919
Get up!

320
00:29:37,427 --> 00:29:38,854
I can't!

321
00:30:04,142 --> 00:30:05,158
Look out!

322
00:30:35,802 --> 00:30:37,151
Shoot!

323
00:30:37,935 --> 00:30:39,380
Hang in there!

324
00:31:23,693 --> 00:31:25,283
What's with you?

325
00:31:25,977 --> 00:31:27,484
I was scared.

326
00:31:28,962 --> 00:31:30,515
Couldn't move.

327
00:31:30,841 --> 00:31:32,257
This always happens.

328
00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:36,257
Hey!

329
00:31:39,157 --> 00:31:40,111
Carry me.

330
00:31:44,892 --> 00:31:46,869
A ghost-hunter, afraid of ghosts.

331
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,367
You're repaying society? Rubbish!

332
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,138
Let's up!

333
00:31:54,383 --> 00:31:55,947
Gently, please.

334
00:31:56,312 --> 00:31:59,151
Dinner's on me when I get paid.

335
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,328
I know, he's terrible.

336
00:32:22,413 --> 00:32:24,156
Told you before, many times.

337
00:32:24,241 --> 00:32:25,476
When?

338
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,781
I did. You weren't listening.

339
00:32:28,686 --> 00:32:30,645
Who succeeds right off the bat?

340
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,473
It takes time.

341
00:32:32,638 --> 00:32:35,309
So kind to ghosts, so nasty to
humans.

342
00:32:35,849 --> 00:32:38,520
He's not just terrible, he's
garbage!

343
00:32:38,697 --> 00:32:40,541
Fine. He's afraid.

344
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:43,278
But he was paralyzed with fear!

345
00:32:44,118 --> 00:32:46,106
There's plenty of time.

346
00:32:47,027 --> 00:32:48,052
Chiu!

347
00:33:07,073 --> 00:33:09,947
Chiu, you promised to give me a
scooter.

348
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:10,942
Yes.

349
00:33:12,374 --> 00:33:15,302
$300, $420 with the gun.

350
00:33:15,547 --> 00:33:16,875
Okay, get it.

351
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,726
He's getting it.

352
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,976
Listen, move on. Get reincarnated.

353
00:33:23,061 --> 00:33:25,504
Otherwise, you'll just get run over
every day.

354
00:33:25,593 --> 00:33:28,315
When mom comes, I'll go.

355
00:33:28,736 --> 00:33:31,143
Mom's coming soon.

356
00:33:40,973 --> 00:33:42,778
Thanks.

357
00:33:46,044 --> 00:33:48,005
His mom is coming?

358
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:49,950
So, she'll die soon.

359
00:33:50,393 --> 00:33:52,497
Who caused whose death?

360
00:33:52,977 --> 00:33:54,486
$420. Not now.

361
00:33:55,147 --> 00:33:56,895
Okay. It's not like you're dying.

362
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,434
Sure, because you're the Star of
Death.

363
00:34:05,061 --> 00:34:06,515
So I'll cause Fung's death?

364
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,247
That's how destiny works.

365
00:34:08,332 --> 00:34:11,341
Even if he weren't your partner,
he'd still die.

366
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:12,934
Not because of you.

367
00:34:13,069 --> 00:34:16,643
Don't flatter yourself. It's not all
about you.

368
00:34:17,411 --> 00:34:19,750
He has to be a ghost to replace Sam.

369
00:34:20,372 --> 00:34:21,257
Yes.

370
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:24,257
A man-ghost partnership. It must be
this way.

371
00:34:24,817 --> 00:34:26,755
If he has unfinished business,

372
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,091
help him finish it.

373
00:34:29,388 --> 00:34:32,156
Then he has to work for you,

374
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,856
and not be a mean ghost.

375
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:40,716
Dinner time.

376
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:48,596
You moved all your books to my home.

377
00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:50,807
Are you a ghost-hunter or a maid?

378
00:34:51,275 --> 00:34:52,796
Your home is so big,

379
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:56,273
it needs some human touches.

380
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,579
Here, taste.

381
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,106
Thanks.

382
00:35:00,338 --> 00:35:01,690
What are friends for?

383
00:35:02,259 --> 00:35:04,854
You eat shrimp? Greens.

384
00:35:04,939 --> 00:35:07,070
We're not friends, just colleagues.

385
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,416
Whatever!

386
00:35:13,247 --> 00:35:15,510
Is it good? Yes.

387
00:35:16,318 --> 00:35:17,567
You learned from TV?

388
00:35:17,652 --> 00:35:19,020
My mom taught me.

389
00:35:22,425 --> 00:35:23,359
Last time…

390
00:35:23,731 --> 00:35:26,845
it was pretty terrible.

391
00:35:27,118 --> 00:35:29,313
Give me time.

392
00:35:29,398 --> 00:35:32,044
Next time I'll be better.

393
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:34,013
I'll be great!

394
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,075
Why be a ghost hunter? You can be a
chef!

395
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,747
I'm in my 20's. Never brought home a
penny.

396
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,328
But it's different now.

397
00:35:43,413 --> 00:35:46,273
Second-in-command at 2002,

398
00:35:46,422 --> 00:35:49,547
nice uniform, better pay.

399
00:35:49,686 --> 00:35:51,444
Not bad.

400
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:54,007
Any unfinished business?

401
00:35:55,226 --> 00:35:56,705
Too many.

402
00:35:57,069 --> 00:36:01,263
Travel, win the lottery, be a
Hollywood star…

403
00:36:01,348 --> 00:36:02,781
Never did any of that.

404
00:36:03,525 --> 00:36:04,475
Anything else?

405
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:05,540
That's it.

406
00:36:08,922 --> 00:36:10,367
I'll get you more rice.

407
00:36:13,105 --> 00:36:14,217
Who are you?

408
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,669
Grandma Pat recommended you.

409
00:36:16,754 --> 00:36:19,486
Call me Grandma Four.

410
00:36:19,571 --> 00:36:23,268
You don't have to match my broccoli.

411
00:36:24,022 --> 00:36:26,411
Just so you know, I'm a ghost.

412
00:36:26,858 --> 00:36:28,424
Of course. I know that.

413
00:36:28,793 --> 00:36:31,700
Pat said you like ghosts.

414
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:34,314
Take care of my granddaughter.

415
00:36:34,844 --> 00:36:36,122
Your granddaughter?

416
00:36:36,515 --> 00:36:38,614
We were both in the car crash.

417
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:40,138
She's still in a coma,

418
00:36:40,254 --> 00:36:42,083
and has no family.

419
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:43,875
Can you take care of her?

420
00:36:44,197 --> 00:36:46,575
Go. We'll help you.

421
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:48,817
Don't trick an old woman!

422
00:36:48,902 --> 00:36:51,028
You know I'm scary.

423
00:36:51,964 --> 00:36:53,916
We promise, Grandma Four.

424
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,306
Go now.

425
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,053
Thank you.

426
00:37:01,517 --> 00:37:03,317
Hospitals are full of ghosts.

427
00:37:03,943 --> 00:37:04,942
I know.

428
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:07,148
Go check out your weak knees?

429
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:08,781
Sure.

430
00:37:09,218 --> 00:37:10,992
Wheelchair rentals over there.

431
00:37:11,371 --> 00:37:12,268
Sure.

432
00:37:42,997 --> 00:37:44,515
Epileptic fit? What?

433
00:37:45,174 --> 00:37:46,776
It looks like her.

434
00:37:47,811 --> 00:37:48,765
Look!

435
00:37:49,221 --> 00:37:50,143
In what way?

436
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,536
They're identical. See that?

437
00:37:52,621 --> 00:37:53,716
She's prettier.

438
00:37:54,442 --> 00:37:57,239
I found this on the street in high
school

439
00:37:57,324 --> 00:37:58,403
and kept it.

440
00:37:59,476 --> 00:38:00,927
You like her?

441
00:38:02,129 --> 00:38:02,979
Yes.

442
00:38:03,064 --> 00:38:04,531
It looks like her.

443
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,848
I don't think so.

444
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,570
Whatever you say.

445
00:38:19,918 --> 00:38:21,018
You!

446
00:38:21,111 --> 00:38:23,023
You work here?

447
00:38:25,525 --> 00:38:27,575
Visiting your girlfriend?

448
00:38:27,988 --> 00:38:29,721
No... Not mine...

449
00:38:29,818 --> 00:38:31,945
His. Not mine.

450
00:38:36,325 --> 00:38:38,320
I'm going.

451
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,439
Hey!

452
00:38:53,238 --> 00:38:54,778
What?

453
00:38:55,978 --> 00:38:57,346
Can you pay back my $5?

454
00:38:58,054 --> 00:38:59,815
I don't have change.

455
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,356
Tomorrow, then.

456
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:04,182
You'll be back?

457
00:39:05,729 --> 00:39:07,424
If you'll pay me back.

458
00:39:08,576 --> 00:39:10,703
Come and I will.

459
00:39:13,097 --> 00:39:14,114
See you then.

460
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,067
Okay.

461
00:39:15,612 --> 00:39:16,609
Tomorrow.

462
00:39:16,909 --> 00:39:17,851
$5

463
00:39:25,276 --> 00:39:27,695
Stop it. She's a vegetable.

464
00:39:29,042 --> 00:39:31,694
The doctor says she could wake up
any time.

465
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:34,587
I'm massaging her, so
her muscles won't atrophy.

466
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:37,099
My wallet's atrophied. Why don't
you massage that?

467
00:39:37,184 --> 00:39:38,978
It's the nurse's job.

468
00:39:39,197 --> 00:39:40,635
You don't understand.

469
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,833
I want to do something for her

470
00:39:42,968 --> 00:39:45,169
to increase her chances of waking
up.

471
00:39:45,773 --> 00:39:46,950
And if she does?

472
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,117
Last night, you asked what I wanted
to do.

473
00:39:51,217 --> 00:39:53,455
I want to fall in love.

474
00:39:53,635 --> 00:39:54,643
With her?

475
00:40:01,572 --> 00:40:04,695
Incredible incident at Central.
Check it out!

476
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:10,614
Now, I have no fear.

477
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,492
No matter what, let me at it.

478
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,799
No more need for rescues?

479
00:40:15,173 --> 00:40:18,395
It's different now. I have
motivation.

480
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,924
I'll kill any spirit I see!

481
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:21,869
Okay.

482
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:25,419
You're here, look.

483
00:40:40,076 --> 00:40:41,713
The body? None.

484
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,026
The driver? None.

485
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:45,531
No driver.

486
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:49,051
What do you want?

487
00:40:49,136 --> 00:40:50,175
It's just…

488
00:40:50,418 --> 00:40:52,861
One, this is the city,

489
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:56,102
but that's a suburban cab.

490
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:59,486
Look, the meter's still on.

491
00:40:59,571 --> 00:41:01,195
But this light is on,

492
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,348
and running meters mean passengers.

493
00:41:03,447 --> 00:41:05,289
This light won't be on.

494
00:41:05,389 --> 00:41:07,046
See, isn't it incredible?

495
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,244
Running meters...

496
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:09,830
This light won't be on...

497
00:41:09,915 --> 00:41:12,328
Isn't it incredible?

498
00:41:28,614 --> 00:41:30,623
What? Well…

499
00:41:32,728 --> 00:41:35,130
Sir, I think this is…

500
00:41:35,215 --> 00:41:37,841
Well, really...

501
00:41:44,965 --> 00:41:46,330
Are you okay?

502
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:47,935
Of course.

503
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,132
I would have gotten out in time.

504
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:52,979
But isn't it incredible?

505
00:41:54,043 --> 00:41:56,455
It's ridiculous, not incredible.

506
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,135
I can't feel any ghosts.

507
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,416
Next time, don't call us for this.

508
00:42:00,594 --> 00:42:02,343
Get the Traffic Department.

509
00:42:02,428 --> 00:42:03,820
I used to work there.

510
00:42:03,905 --> 00:42:05,317
Call a Lau Wah.

511
00:42:05,402 --> 00:42:06,718
Lau Wah?

512
00:42:06,803 --> 00:42:08,351
Do you know him?

513
00:42:08,436 --> 00:42:09,442
Should I call?

514
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,799
Should I?

515
00:42:10,922 --> 00:42:16,190
Not incredible, just moronic.

516
00:42:17,489 --> 00:42:20,151
Isn't it incredible?

517
00:42:36,066 --> 00:42:39,609
2002 killed your girl...

518
00:42:40,525 --> 00:42:42,500
Get your revenge on them.

519
00:42:42,598 --> 00:42:43,809
That's all I know.

520
00:42:59,775 --> 00:43:00,661
Get up!

521
00:43:03,611 --> 00:43:04,861
Wake up!

522
00:43:28,894 --> 00:43:30,005
It's you?

523
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:33,445
Don't touch me. I'm fine.

524
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:35,507
No...

525
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,117
Stay away, please.

526
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:39,625
Make breakfast,

527
00:43:39,731 --> 00:43:42,234
read, do something. I don't mind.

528
00:43:43,315 --> 00:43:45,281
No, I'm going to... Don't touch.

529
00:43:45,382 --> 00:43:47,401
I'm going to see Rain. You coming?

530
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:49,166
I've got plans.

531
00:43:51,971 --> 00:43:52,861
Okay.

532
00:43:53,448 --> 00:43:54,345
Bye.

533
00:43:54,537 --> 00:43:55,401
Bye.

534
00:44:04,633 --> 00:44:05,929
It's comfortable?

535
00:44:06,362 --> 00:44:07,270
Yes.

536
00:44:08,663 --> 00:44:09,777
Expensive?

537
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:10,900
Yes.

538
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:13,893
May I try?

539
00:44:16,072 --> 00:44:17,195
No power.

540
00:44:32,854 --> 00:44:34,606
What are you up to?

541
00:44:35,658 --> 00:44:38,492
She can wake up to a new scene.

542
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:45,223
It's a hospital, not a garden.

543
00:44:45,371 --> 00:44:47,385
Hospitals are dreary.

544
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:49,281
It won't do.

545
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,294
Flowers suck oxygen, don't you know
that?

546
00:44:53,388 --> 00:44:55,372
You're the one who doesn't know.

547
00:44:56,249 --> 00:44:59,046
They produce carbon dioxide at
night.

548
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:03,187
Don't touch this.

549
00:45:03,281 --> 00:45:05,101
So now you're her boyfriend.

550
00:45:05,186 --> 00:45:06,653
I'm positioning it.

551
00:45:09,059 --> 00:45:11,825
She'll wake up, and see me first.

552
00:45:14,242 --> 00:45:15,539
Here.

553
00:45:17,544 --> 00:45:19,531
The legs over there.

554
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:22,000
You bought this.

555
00:45:30,388 --> 00:45:32,661
It's not for you.

556
00:45:33,224 --> 00:45:34,669
You've gone too far.

557
00:45:35,902 --> 00:45:37,460
She's not dead.

558
00:45:37,656 --> 00:45:39,760
Her back must be stiff from this.

559
00:45:39,845 --> 00:45:41,654
You've felt her back?

560
00:45:43,013 --> 00:45:44,638
Such a dirty mind.

561
00:45:44,988 --> 00:45:45,960
Help me.

562
00:45:46,045 --> 00:45:47,614
Help, here.

563
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:48,867
To do what?

564
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,986
Move her there. It's not for you.

565
00:45:52,398 --> 00:45:54,083
Come on!

566
00:45:54,179 --> 00:45:55,390
Look at me,

567
00:45:55,475 --> 00:45:56,893
look at my clothes.

568
00:45:58,013 --> 00:45:59,307
What?

569
00:45:59,669 --> 00:46:01,367
It's just our uniform.

570
00:46:01,549 --> 00:46:02,726
You know that.

571
00:46:02,811 --> 00:46:05,151
We're on duty, and not as orderlies!

572
00:46:05,273 --> 00:46:07,515
On duty is on duty.

573
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,671
Life is life.

574
00:46:09,756 --> 00:46:12,390
An exciting life makes one work
harder.

575
00:46:12,475 --> 00:46:13,632
Don't touch.

576
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,142
Don't help. Get out there.

577
00:46:17,227 --> 00:46:18,661
There's a ghost.

578
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,384
Go get it.

579
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:39,609
Chiu, why are you here?

580
00:46:40,027 --> 00:46:41,736
Why are you here?

581
00:46:42,085 --> 00:46:43,869
Waiting for mom.

582
00:46:44,394 --> 00:46:47,325
She's bleeding too much! Hurry!

583
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:49,263
Oxygen for the baby!

584
00:46:49,396 --> 00:46:50,403
Yes! Hurry!

585
00:46:50,827 --> 00:46:52,747
There's mom.

586
00:46:57,677 --> 00:46:59,562
Doctor, how is my wife?

587
00:46:59,652 --> 00:47:03,541
Neither she nor the baby will
live. I'm sorry.

588
00:47:16,242 --> 00:47:17,236
Mom!

589
00:47:20,555 --> 00:47:21,403
Mom!

590
00:47:24,477 --> 00:47:25,617
Son!

591
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,213
Mom, let's go.

592
00:47:37,874 --> 00:47:40,877
Son, listen.

593
00:47:40,962 --> 00:47:43,739
Enter your baby brother. Live again.

594
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:47,179
Mom, you're not taking me?

595
00:47:49,808 --> 00:47:53,463
Stay with dad. Cheer him up.

596
00:47:53,899 --> 00:47:56,572
Mom will watch you from afar.

597
00:48:06,439 --> 00:48:08,424
Son, go now.

598
00:48:12,457 --> 00:48:14,572
Good boy. Listen to mom.

599
00:48:15,342 --> 00:48:16,848
Don't hide your tears.

600
00:48:17,619 --> 00:48:20,132
Human tears mean stubbornness,

601
00:48:20,749 --> 00:48:24,473
but ghost tears mean love and
resurrection.

602
00:48:25,974 --> 00:48:27,075
Now go.

603
00:48:36,841 --> 00:48:38,171
What can I do?

604
00:48:52,345 --> 00:48:54,098
Your wife has a message.

605
00:48:57,049 --> 00:49:00,622
She says this is fate, but don't be
sad.

606
00:49:01,277 --> 00:49:05,901
When you can, find the baby a new
mother.

607
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:14,822
Doctor, the baby's breathing!

608
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,710
What?

609
00:49:38,057 --> 00:49:39,156
Come here!

610
00:49:46,361 --> 00:49:47,750
Your money.

611
00:49:55,523 --> 00:49:56,916
I don't have change.

612
00:49:57,134 --> 00:50:00,070
Neither do I. Now you owe me.

613
00:50:02,527 --> 00:50:03,479
Bye.

614
00:50:12,908 --> 00:50:14,867
You're flirting with a nurse?

615
00:50:15,698 --> 00:50:17,809
And you with a patient.

616
00:50:18,298 --> 00:50:20,666
What a lewd smile!

617
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,458
Congratulations!

618
00:50:26,114 --> 00:50:27,132
For what?

619
00:50:27,743 --> 00:50:31,708
Rosy cheeks.

620
00:50:32,361 --> 00:50:34,640
You're in love.

621
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:38,078
Dating? You want to kill her?

622
00:50:38,163 --> 00:50:39,632
No! What are you saying?

623
00:50:39,717 --> 00:50:40,656
I'm saying…

624
00:50:40,974 --> 00:50:42,538
What's in your pocket?

625
00:50:42,662 --> 00:50:44,747
None of your business! Take it out!

626
00:50:44,832 --> 00:50:46,177
You know what's there?

627
00:50:46,262 --> 00:50:48,208
It's a heart! Out!

628
00:50:48,623 --> 00:50:49,674
Take it out!

629
00:50:49,811 --> 00:50:50,851
It's a heart.

630
00:50:50,936 --> 00:50:51,802
It's a plane.

631
00:50:51,887 --> 00:50:52,742
A plane?

632
00:50:52,922 --> 00:50:55,796
It's a heart. You say plane? Fine.

633
00:50:55,881 --> 00:50:57,531
It's a plane heart.

634
00:50:57,837 --> 00:51:01,484
You're not responsible for Fung's
death,

635
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,182
but dating will kill her.

636
00:51:04,872 --> 00:51:05,817
Watch out,

637
00:51:06,069 --> 00:51:08,447
unless you want an afterlife
wedding.

638
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:30,067
Hi!

639
00:51:32,598 --> 00:51:34,333
Here's your $995.

640
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:38,901
You don't have to pay me back yet.

641
00:51:40,408 --> 00:51:41,807
Debts must be cleared.

642
00:51:42,373 --> 00:51:44,312
Dinner tonight?

643
00:51:45,779 --> 00:51:47,330
I can't tonight.

644
00:51:47,987 --> 00:51:49,065
Tomorrow?

645
00:51:50,726 --> 00:51:51,742
I can't.

646
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:55,294
Can't, or don't want to?

647
00:51:56,798 --> 00:51:57,927
I don't want to.

648
00:51:59,776 --> 00:52:00,895
Why not?

649
00:52:01,974 --> 00:52:03,065
No reason.

650
00:52:04,564 --> 00:52:06,572
Any reason you're blocking my way?

651
00:52:07,032 --> 00:52:08,854
Let me in.

652
00:52:13,244 --> 00:52:14,932
Emergency room, nurse.

653
00:52:17,929 --> 00:52:18,927
I'm sorry.

654
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:02,906
Doctor!

655
00:53:03,891 --> 00:53:04,804
Doctor!

656
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,937
Rain is awake!

657
00:53:08,816 --> 00:53:09,741
Doctor!

658
00:53:13,362 --> 00:53:14,760
Blink.

659
00:53:16,018 --> 00:53:17,183
Tongue out.

660
00:53:18,043 --> 00:53:20,445
More, more.

661
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:22,354
Good.

662
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:25,557
Raise your left hand. Grab my
finger.

663
00:53:26,087 --> 00:53:28,346
Harder, harder.

664
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:30,216
Okay, not so hard.

665
00:53:30,872 --> 00:53:32,684
What is your name?

666
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:38,489
Take your time.

667
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:39,770
Rest.

668
00:53:48,043 --> 00:53:49,169
She's awake.

669
00:53:49,879 --> 00:53:50,846
I know.

670
00:53:51,882 --> 00:53:53,872
Talk to her, she can hear you.

671
00:53:53,968 --> 00:53:55,277
Talk to her a lot.

672
00:53:55,496 --> 00:53:58,091
Will she suddenly go back to sleep?

673
00:53:58,543 --> 00:54:00,684
If she's awake, she's awake.

674
00:54:01,036 --> 00:54:03,145
If she sleeps, she sleeps.

675
00:54:03,389 --> 00:54:05,588
Next morning, she'll wake.

676
00:54:06,666 --> 00:54:08,890
She's like a normal person,

677
00:54:09,535 --> 00:54:12,992
but you can't treat her like one.

678
00:54:13,112 --> 00:54:16,179
But don't treat her like she's not
normal,

679
00:54:16,348 --> 00:54:18,783
or she'll never adust to normal
life.

680
00:54:19,448 --> 00:54:20,640
It's contradictory.

681
00:54:21,296 --> 00:54:22,257
Which means?

682
00:54:22,978 --> 00:54:25,937
In summary, she's awake.

683
00:54:26,778 --> 00:54:28,268
But after a long coma,

684
00:54:28,353 --> 00:54:30,286
she'll have short-term amnesia.

685
00:54:30,899 --> 00:54:33,109
Just remember one word.

686
00:54:33,886 --> 00:54:36,841
Care about her, cherish her...

687
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:38,351
Love her.

688
00:54:43,431 --> 00:54:44,838
That's seven words.

689
00:54:45,236 --> 00:54:47,588
You really don't remember anything?

690
00:54:47,673 --> 00:54:48,838
Who are you?

691
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:50,804
Fung.

692
00:54:51,546 --> 00:54:53,989
I'm Fung. I just told you.

693
00:54:54,192 --> 00:54:57,005
Yes! Who are you?

694
00:55:00,191 --> 00:55:01,575
Fung.

695
00:55:02,643 --> 00:55:03,882
Is that you?

696
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:06,557
This? Yes.

697
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:08,645
Yes, I'm your boyfriend.

698
00:55:08,778 --> 00:55:12,427
You took this on my birthday.

699
00:55:12,688 --> 00:55:15,260
Looks like you took it yourself.

700
00:55:15,481 --> 00:55:18,369
Really? No.

701
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:22,028
I'll really cause Fung's death?

702
00:55:22,133 --> 00:55:24,679
It must be a man-ghost partnership.

703
00:55:25,682 --> 00:55:27,250
If he's fated to die,

704
00:55:27,335 --> 00:55:30,705
Even if he weren't your partner,
he'd still die.

705
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:36,638
Fung, we need to talk. Come here.

706
00:55:38,387 --> 00:55:39,350
Wait.

707
00:55:43,378 --> 00:55:44,360
Paper Chan.

708
00:55:45,288 --> 00:55:46,445
Paper Chan!

709
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,539
Why are we here?

710
00:55:54,195 --> 00:55:55,770
Don't touch. It's for you.

711
00:55:55,969 --> 00:55:56,958
For you!

712
00:55:57,683 --> 00:55:58,927
Paper Chan.

713
00:55:59,109 --> 00:56:00,552
Stop shouting. I know.

714
00:56:00,637 --> 00:56:02,419
You want me to tell him.

715
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:04,324
What?

716
00:56:04,409 --> 00:56:06,372
You know why you're my partner?

717
00:56:07,232 --> 00:56:09,973
Because I can give up dignity for
ideals,

718
00:56:10,168 --> 00:56:11,056
right?

719
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:14,677
Life is about birth and death.

720
00:56:15,348 --> 00:56:17,028
You're dying!

721
00:56:21,531 --> 00:56:24,005
Our department uses man-ghost
partnerships.

722
00:56:25,186 --> 00:56:26,908
We're burning these for you.

723
00:56:49,628 --> 00:56:51,736
You don't believe it?

724
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:55,726
That's life.

725
00:56:56,069 --> 00:56:57,922
Death is a solemn thing.

726
00:56:59,286 --> 00:57:01,018
If it's your time to die,

727
00:57:01,146 --> 00:57:03,817
You have to accept it.

728
00:57:46,791 --> 00:57:53,622
Life and death... I must die...

729
00:57:54,568 --> 00:57:56,145
but not you two! Why?

730
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:02,041
Why burn these for me?

731
00:58:05,653 --> 00:58:06,700
Here!

732
00:59:28,987 --> 00:59:31,044
Why did you tell me?

733
00:59:31,565 --> 00:59:33,216
Just let me die.

734
00:59:36,065 --> 00:59:38,781
I told you so you can prepare
yourself.

735
00:59:40,854 --> 00:59:42,385
I've brought your money.

736
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:44,625
Do what you want.

737
00:59:48,716 --> 00:59:49,563
Money?

738
00:59:49,721 --> 00:59:51,093
It can buy more life?

739
00:59:53,397 --> 00:59:55,442
Go play, go home. I don't care.

740
00:59:55,527 --> 00:59:56,687
Don't sit here.

741
00:59:58,059 --> 01:00:00,236
If you want, I'll see Rain with you.

742
01:00:05,866 --> 01:00:09,239
You told me so I won't be with her.

743
01:00:09,675 --> 01:00:11,393
Why tell me to see her now?

744
01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:14,072
So you can be her friend.

745
01:00:14,663 --> 01:00:16,539
Do you know she'll like you?

746
01:00:17,932 --> 01:00:20,036
See her one last time, for closure.

747
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:21,942
I don't want you to have regrets.

748
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,333
Chan told you.

749
01:00:25,647 --> 01:00:28,776
You won't cause my death, so don't
feel guilty.

750
01:00:29,033 --> 01:00:31,065
Why tell me to see her now?

751
01:00:31,326 --> 01:00:33,039
You'd rather wait here to die?

752
01:00:33,124 --> 01:00:34,218
I don't know.

753
01:00:35,517 --> 01:00:37,934
I wish you could cause my death,

754
01:00:38,019 --> 01:00:39,419
so I could beat you up!

755
01:00:39,504 --> 01:00:40,270
Go ahead!

756
01:00:40,355 --> 01:00:41,650
Beat me up!

757
01:00:45,597 --> 01:00:47,872
I bring death to my friends!

758
01:00:47,959 --> 01:00:49,231
You think I like it?

759
01:00:49,316 --> 01:00:50,367
And me?

760
01:00:50,506 --> 01:00:53,338
I'm 24, no girlfriends. Just a
photo.

761
01:00:53,903 --> 01:00:55,273
I'm 22.

762
01:00:55,761 --> 01:00:57,687
Chan says I'll live 'til 80.

763
01:00:57,772 --> 01:00:59,333
80!

764
01:00:59,587 --> 01:01:01,914
Causing the death of every friend.

765
01:01:02,362 --> 01:01:05,351
I found my girl, but I can't date
her.

766
01:01:10,072 --> 01:01:11,911
I hope that...

767
01:01:12,813 --> 01:01:16,536
I'm the one who dies.

768
01:01:24,659 --> 01:01:26,066
Then you're worse off.

769
01:01:26,915 --> 01:01:29,203
You're worse off than me. You'll
die.

770
01:01:29,364 --> 01:01:31,809
You're worse off. A life worse than
death.

771
01:01:32,593 --> 01:01:34,044
That's true,

772
01:01:34,216 --> 01:01:36,546
but you'll die with hate in your
heart.

773
01:02:00,631 --> 01:02:03,322
I woke up and forgot who I am.

774
01:02:03,757 --> 01:02:05,507
I saw your photo.

775
01:02:05,896 --> 01:02:07,401
You're my boyfriend?

776
01:02:14,158 --> 01:02:16,630
I wish, but no.

777
01:02:19,555 --> 01:02:21,671
You don't know me. I'm Fung.

778
01:02:23,027 --> 01:02:24,812
Did you do this, Fung?

779
01:02:25,718 --> 01:02:26,570
Yes.

780
01:02:27,635 --> 01:02:29,963
It's so pretty. Thanks.

781
01:02:36,273 --> 01:02:37,778
Are you my friend?

782
01:02:38,324 --> 01:02:40,768
Yes, my only friend.

783
01:02:42,414 --> 01:02:45,447
But, I may not remember you in a
minute.

784
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:48,880
Just remember this one.

785
01:02:51,758 --> 01:02:54,067
You're Fung.

786
01:03:30,157 --> 01:03:32,510
You have a Grandma named Four.

787
01:03:33,112 --> 01:03:34,651
She told me to visit you.

788
01:03:34,747 --> 01:03:36,065
Why didn't she come?

789
01:03:37,166 --> 01:03:39,656
Next time, I'll tell her.

790
01:03:57,741 --> 01:03:59,005
Your girlfriend?

791
01:04:02,392 --> 01:04:03,755
I had one, too.

792
01:04:04,762 --> 01:04:06,343
Go, find her.

793
01:04:07,147 --> 01:04:08,708
Who are you talking to?

794
01:04:08,793 --> 01:04:10,052
Nothing.

795
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:13,335
She's disappeared.

796
01:04:13,665 --> 01:04:15,289
I'll never find her.

797
01:04:16,834 --> 01:04:20,752
Remember the girl you killed at the
fire?

798
01:04:42,762 --> 01:04:43,937
Rain, run!

799
01:04:44,022 --> 01:04:44,898
Yes!

800
01:07:26,827 --> 01:07:29,109
Chan said I'd live 'til 80.

801
01:07:45,943 --> 01:07:46,940
Readings?

802
01:07:47,097 --> 01:07:49,367
Blood pressure 60/40, pulse 38.

803
01:08:01,817 --> 01:08:03,440
110/70, pulse 70.

804
01:08:03,525 --> 01:08:05,257
Notify ICU, he's coming.

805
01:08:06,233 --> 01:08:08,815
His brain's damaged from lack of
oxygen.

806
01:08:09,326 --> 01:08:11,052
He's at ICU for observation,

807
01:08:11,137 --> 01:08:12,847
still in critical condition.

808
01:08:12,932 --> 01:08:15,200
He may not last the night.

809
01:08:15,852 --> 01:08:17,453
Just one word...

810
01:08:17,538 --> 01:08:18,684
Got it.

811
01:08:23,058 --> 01:08:24,622
Fung!

812
01:08:24,887 --> 01:08:26,875
Where's Chiu?

813
01:08:26,974 --> 01:08:29,273
Why him, and not me?

814
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,192
We can't know fate.

815
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:34,880
We trusted you! Now you say this?

816
01:08:34,968 --> 01:08:36,276
It's all talk!

817
01:08:36,402 --> 01:08:38,736
Not true. It's fate!

818
01:08:41,184 --> 01:08:43,559
The water ghost is strong. He'll be
back.

819
01:08:44,241 --> 01:08:45,617
Be careful.

820
01:08:45,702 --> 01:08:47,059
I don't care.

821
01:08:47,164 --> 01:08:49,044
Tell me how to find Chiu's soul

822
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:53,679
Go where he has unresolved issues.

823
01:09:59,035 --> 01:10:00,392
It's my turn.

824
01:10:03,974 --> 01:10:05,838
I know how you felt.

825
01:10:08,653 --> 01:10:10,229
Sometimes...

826
01:10:11,552 --> 01:10:12,893
it's not up to us.

827
01:10:14,979 --> 01:10:16,882
I thought everything was fated.

828
01:10:18,916 --> 01:10:20,330
So I obeyed Chan

829
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:22,882
in all that he said.

830
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:28,776
I didn't dare make friends.

831
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:32,235
I wasted my time.

832
01:10:32,585 --> 01:10:33,963
You didn't.

833
01:10:35,145 --> 01:10:37,408
You helped ghosts, and you helped
me.

834
01:10:38,014 --> 01:10:41,441
If it wasn't for you, I still
wouldn't know what I want.

835
01:10:42,643 --> 01:10:45,252
I often ask others what they want,

836
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,062
but never myself.

837
01:10:53,942 --> 01:10:56,578
What unresolved business do you
have?

838
01:11:02,634 --> 01:11:04,507
Give me some Vision Drops.

839
01:11:12,461 --> 01:11:14,200
Let's have dinner, please.

840
01:11:39,552 --> 01:11:41,281
Excuse me, bathroom.

841
01:12:09,117 --> 01:12:10,619
You're all wet.

842
01:12:13,147 --> 01:12:14,500
I fell.

843
01:12:21,481 --> 01:12:22,671
Laugh if you want.

844
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:33,489
I need to tell you something.

845
01:12:33,589 --> 01:12:34,463
Yes?

846
01:12:40,593 --> 01:12:41,760
I like you.

847
01:12:42,889 --> 01:12:43,908
What?

848
01:12:44,842 --> 01:12:46,473
Yes. I like you.

849
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:54,080
I always wondered…

850
01:12:54,165 --> 01:12:57,721
why we kept meeting on the bus, you
and me.

851
01:12:58,659 --> 01:13:01,432
You kept asking for your $5.

852
01:13:01,686 --> 01:13:03,294
You turned down

853
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,593
my dinner invitation,

854
01:13:05,678 --> 01:13:08,940
but never explained why.

855
01:13:09,692 --> 01:13:11,648
Now, suddenly,

856
01:13:13,452 --> 01:13:15,591
you say you like me.

857
01:13:16,653 --> 01:13:19,096
I don't know what you want.

858
01:13:22,265 --> 01:13:24,132
I just wanted to tell you…

859
01:13:24,519 --> 01:13:26,393
I've liked you for a long time.

860
01:13:29,958 --> 01:13:31,718
Your favorite color is white.

861
01:13:32,407 --> 01:13:33,947
Not just your uniform.

862
01:13:35,304 --> 01:13:37,328
You wear white

863
01:13:37,572 --> 01:13:39,635
a few times a week.

864
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:42,074
You're environmentally aware,

865
01:13:42,268 --> 01:13:44,500
and only use canvas totes.

866
01:13:46,916 --> 01:13:48,906
On Wednesdays, you wear glasses.

867
01:13:50,353 --> 01:13:51,940
I think that's because

868
01:13:52,025 --> 01:13:54,450
you stay up late in the ER on
Tuesdays,

869
01:13:55,255 --> 01:13:59,104
and can't get your contacts in the
next morning.

870
01:14:00,915 --> 01:14:02,382
You love ice cream.

871
01:14:03,088 --> 01:14:05,072
When the bus passes Haagen-Dazs,

872
01:14:05,526 --> 01:14:07,184
you look hungry.

873
01:14:10,684 --> 01:14:12,812
You must like white bunny dolls.

874
01:14:14,198 --> 01:14:15,593
How do you know?

875
01:14:18,746 --> 01:14:20,500
You look like one.

876
01:14:22,086 --> 01:14:23,721
Can you come with me?

877
01:14:24,195 --> 01:14:25,075
Where?

878
01:14:25,698 --> 01:14:27,122
For ice cream.

879
01:14:27,305 --> 01:14:28,466
Let's have it here.

880
01:14:29,499 --> 01:14:31,007
You know what I like.

881
01:14:32,075 --> 01:14:33,304
Come on, let's go.

882
01:14:40,906 --> 01:14:41,932
What?

883
01:14:49,617 --> 01:14:51,447
Where are you going?

884
01:15:23,746 --> 01:15:26,716
I'm so sorry. I can't go with you.

885
01:15:27,333 --> 01:15:28,458
Next time.

886
01:15:30,185 --> 01:15:31,997
There may not be a next time.

887
01:15:32,163 --> 01:15:33,398
Where are you going?

888
01:15:33,541 --> 01:15:35,085
No time. I have to go.

889
01:15:35,731 --> 01:15:37,916
When we had time, I did nothing.

890
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:41,838
Now, all I can do is eat with you.

891
01:15:42,341 --> 01:15:45,057
And I've always wanted to give you
this.

892
01:15:45,815 --> 01:15:48,994
Better late than never.

893
01:15:49,665 --> 01:15:51,625
Go to the hospital. You'll see.

894
01:15:52,267 --> 01:15:53,095
Bye.

895
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:53,254
Come on. The precinct heads want to
see you.

896
01:17:53,339 --> 01:17:54,684
Turn in your gun.

897
01:17:54,973 --> 01:17:56,789
Yau's in a coma.

898
01:17:57,045 --> 01:18:00,518
As a rookie, you can't be in charge
of 2002.

899
01:18:01,189 --> 01:18:04,484
We cannot keep a headless
department.

900
01:18:04,929 --> 01:18:07,205
We'll keep the spirit-striking gun.

901
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:09,479
I'll arrange a new job for you.

902
01:18:11,024 --> 01:18:14,343
Fung, starting today, all work from
2002 is suspended.

903
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:17,065
We'll issue further instructions
later on.

904
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:18,932
Who dares cut my department!

905
01:18:43,009 --> 01:18:45,864
As the former head of 2002,

906
01:18:46,092 --> 01:18:47,833
I refuse to let you do this.

907
01:18:49,415 --> 01:18:50,924
The former head? Yes.

908
01:18:51,009 --> 01:18:52,981
You said former.

909
01:18:53,610 --> 01:18:56,382
All precincts oversee 2002,

910
01:18:56,561 --> 01:18:58,489
and many have signed this.

911
01:18:58,576 --> 01:19:00,466
Who are you to refuse?

912
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:02,815
Each world keeps its order.

913
01:19:02,922 --> 01:19:04,994
Humans have human cops.

914
01:19:05,246 --> 01:19:07,322
Ghosts have ghost cops.

915
01:19:07,569 --> 01:19:10,338
Must a headless department be cut?

916
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:11,460
I ask you.

917
01:19:11,545 --> 01:19:15,122
If all the senior police officers
died,

918
01:19:15,207 --> 01:19:17,648
would the Hong Kong Police shut
down?

919
01:19:17,733 --> 01:19:18,695
Answer me!

920
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:22,669
Yes, you keep order in the ghost
world.

921
01:19:23,936 --> 01:19:27,351
But you often leave me with
problems.

922
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:30,234
Consider my position.

923
01:19:30,430 --> 01:19:31,953
Sure. Excuse me.

924
01:19:32,244 --> 01:19:33,367
Let me think.

925
01:19:37,132 --> 01:19:37,991
Well?

926
01:19:45,728 --> 01:19:49,658
That's why I couldn't find
you! You've possessed Fung!

927
01:19:54,536 --> 01:19:57,080
Help...

928
01:19:57,424 --> 01:19:58,548
Help!

929
01:19:58,953 --> 01:20:00,009
Help!

930
01:20:18,247 --> 01:20:20,689
Return to your body, before it's too
late.

931
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:22,965
Fung's in trouble. I have to help
him.

932
01:20:23,050 --> 01:20:24,661
Make sure you can come back.

933
01:20:24,746 --> 01:20:26,104
I run my own life.

934
01:20:39,158 --> 01:20:40,916
Now you owe me $5.

935
01:20:41,001 --> 01:20:42,875
You have to pay me back.

936
01:20:43,504 --> 01:20:44,703
I'm waiting.

937
01:21:29,021 --> 01:21:31,125
Chiu, show no mercy!

938
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:32,971
Get the Water Ghost out

939
01:21:33,056 --> 01:21:35,289
before he completely controls Fung!

940
01:21:35,522 --> 01:21:37,994
When his other eye turns blue,

941
01:21:38,291 --> 01:21:40,403
you have to kill Fung

942
01:21:40,488 --> 01:21:42,187
to destroy the Water Ghost.

943
01:22:56,611 --> 01:22:58,106
He's good!

944
01:23:03,599 --> 01:23:05,606
I'll use my ultimate move!

945
01:23:23,181 --> 01:23:25,869
Chiu, sword incoming!

946
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:27,703
Go!

947
01:24:00,516 --> 01:24:02,364
You want to kill Fung?

948
01:24:02,449 --> 01:24:04,440
Burn me something to get it out!

949
01:24:28,874 --> 01:24:30,854
His pulse has stopped.

950
01:24:34,814 --> 01:24:36,669
Give him CPR!

951
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:48,752
Chiu, clobber him!

952
01:24:49,438 --> 01:24:50,432
Burn!

953
01:25:11,318 --> 01:25:13,085
You'll die!

954
01:25:43,047 --> 01:25:44,955
Nothing. Give him epinephrine!

955
01:26:06,690 --> 01:26:08,236
So much pain…

956
01:26:09,283 --> 01:26:10,470
Kill me!

957
01:27:03,283 --> 01:27:05,268
When his other eye turns blue,

958
01:27:05,353 --> 01:27:07,666
you have to kill Fung

959
01:27:07,969 --> 01:27:10,705
in order to destroy the Water Ghost.

960
01:27:17,411 --> 01:27:21,148
You won't cause my death, so don't
feel guilty.

961
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,328
I bring death to my friends.

962
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:25,695
You think I like it?

963
01:27:34,872 --> 01:27:37,674
I wish you did cause my death,

964
01:27:38,152 --> 01:27:40,247
So I could beat you up!

965
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:41,216
Go ahead!

966
01:27:41,301 --> 01:27:42,363
Beat me up!

967
01:28:04,685 --> 01:28:06,031
I want to join you.

968
01:28:06,203 --> 01:28:07,223
For the pay?

969
01:28:07,543 --> 01:28:10,838
No. I want to give back to society.

970
01:28:15,301 --> 01:28:17,083
What are friends for?

971
01:28:17,239 --> 01:28:18,729
You eat shrimp? Greens.

972
01:28:18,814 --> 01:28:21,166
We're not frineds, just colleagues.

973
01:28:26,707 --> 01:28:28,658
You're flirting with a nurse?

974
01:28:29,392 --> 01:28:31,317
And you with a patient.

975
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:58,463
Wake up!

976
01:29:02,581 --> 01:29:04,760
Okay, Danielle. Stop.

977
01:29:06,914 --> 01:29:08,851
Certify time of death as 2:20pm.

978
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:12,377
You know him? Take care of this.

979
01:31:13,654 --> 01:31:16,346
Chiu, it's loaded with my blood.

980
01:31:16,478 --> 01:31:18,567
Fung is beyond help. Kill him!

981
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:24,812
No more time.

982
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:28,830
Shoot.

983
01:31:29,170 --> 01:31:31,170
This is only chance!

984
01:32:08,271 --> 01:32:09,695
No more time.

985
01:32:12,215 --> 01:32:13,105
Shoot!

986
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:21,273
Shoot!

987
01:32:21,358 --> 01:32:23,458
We're man-ghost partners!

988
01:32:30,601 --> 01:32:32,463
We're not partners...

989
01:32:33,869 --> 01:32:35,085
We're friends.

990
01:32:58,996 --> 01:33:01,419
Human tears mean stubbornness.

991
01:33:01,742 --> 01:33:05,192
Ghost tears mean love and
resurrection.

992
01:33:46,033 --> 01:33:48,960
Hurry before your Vision Drops wear
off.

993
01:33:49,497 --> 01:33:50,367
I can't.

994
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:53,468
I'm used to floating.

995
01:33:53,887 --> 01:33:56,223
I can't walk fast.

996
01:33:56,868 --> 01:33:58,174
Go in.

997
01:33:58,556 --> 01:33:59,835
And you?

998
01:34:00,785 --> 01:34:02,486
No, you're family.

999
01:34:02,588 --> 01:34:03,958
She won't remember me.

1000
01:34:05,519 --> 01:34:08,721
No, she'll recognize you faster.

1001
01:34:09,552 --> 01:34:10,429
Fung…

1002
01:34:13,597 --> 01:34:14,893
Your Grandma?

1003
01:34:18,317 --> 01:34:19,182
Yes.

1004
01:34:20,688 --> 01:34:22,955
I know you wish to join them.

1005
01:34:23,163 --> 01:34:24,083
Go away.

1006
01:34:24,706 --> 01:34:27,734
No, I can do it. I'm fine.

1007
01:34:27,819 --> 01:34:30,458
Show me.

1008
01:34:33,936 --> 01:34:36,703
You use man-ghost partners.

1009
01:34:36,932 --> 01:34:38,257
Arranged by fate.

1010
01:34:38,741 --> 01:34:39,916
Says who?

1011
01:34:55,192 --> 01:34:57,914
2002 will now use two-man partners.

1012
01:34:58,042 --> 01:34:59,515
It's my final word.

1013
01:35:00,968 --> 01:35:03,950
You won't buy from me any more.

1014
01:35:06,533 --> 01:35:11,369
2002, something incredible's
happened. Check it out!
