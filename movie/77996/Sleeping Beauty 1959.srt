1
00:00:14,855 --> 00:00:17,380
I know you

2
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:22,794
I walked with you
once upon a dream

3
00:00:22,863 --> 00:00:25,525
I know you

4
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,730
The gleam in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam

5
00:00:30,804 --> 00:00:33,739
Yet I know it's true

6
00:00:33,807 --> 00:00:38,574
That visions are seldom
all they seem

7
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:43,082
But if I know you
I know what you'll do

8
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,209
You'll love me at once

9
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:52,418
The way you did
once upon a dream

10
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:05,855
In a faraway land
long ago...

11
00:02:05,928 --> 00:02:08,863
lived a king
and his fair queen.

12
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:11,832
Many years had they
longed for a child,

13
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,528
and finally their wish
was granted.

14
00:02:14,603 --> 00:02:19,506
A daughter was born,
and they called her Aurora.

15
00:02:19,574 --> 00:02:23,874
Sweet Aurora

16
00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:29,049
Yes, they named her
after the dawn,

17
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:33,144
for she filled their lives
with sunshine.

18
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:36,713
Then a great holiday was proclaimed
throughout the kingdom...

19
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:39,693
so that all of
high or low estate...

20
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:43,492
might pay homage
to the infant princess.

21
00:02:43,565 --> 00:02:47,865
And our story begins
on that most joyful day.

22
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,962
On thatjoyful day

23
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:56,875
On thatjoyful day

24
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,909
Joyfully now
to our Princess we come

25
00:03:01,983 --> 00:03:04,383
Bringing gifts
and all good wishes too

26
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:06,683
We pledge our loyalty anew

27
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:11,055
Hail to the Princess Aurora

28
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:15,153
All ofher subjects
adore her

29
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,496
Hail to the King
Hail to the Queen

30
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:23,937
Hail to the Princess Aurora

31
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:28,101
Health to the Princess
Wealth to the Princess

32
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:32,442
Long live the Princess Aurora

33
00:03:32,514 --> 00:03:35,608
Hail Aurora

34
00:03:36,852 --> 00:03:39,912
Hail Aurora

35
00:03:41,256 --> 00:03:45,522
Health to the Princess
Wealth to the Princess

36
00:03:45,594 --> 00:03:49,621
Long live the Princess Aurora

37
00:03:49,698 --> 00:03:53,964
Hail to the King
Hail to the Queen

38
00:03:54,035 --> 00:04:01,305
Hail to the Princess Aurora

39
00:04:03,512 --> 00:04:05,946
Thus, on this great
and joyous day...

40
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:10,576
did all the kingdom celebrate
the long-awaited royal birth.

41
00:04:10,652 --> 00:04:15,282
And good King Stefan and his queen
made welcome their lifelong friend.

42
00:04:22,364 --> 00:04:25,731
Their Royal Highnesses,

43
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,463
King Hubert
and Prince Phillip!

44
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:33,501
Fondly had these monarchs
dreamed one day...

45
00:04:33,575 --> 00:04:35,566
their kingdoms to unite.

46
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:39,910
Thus, today would they announce
that Phillip, Hubert's son and heir,

47
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:42,950
to Stefan's child
would be betrothed.

48
00:04:45,086 --> 00:04:47,850
And so to her
his gift he brought...

49
00:04:47,923 --> 00:04:51,689
and looked unknowing
on his future bride.

50
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,507
Their most honored
and exalted excellencies,

51
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:13,012
the Three Good Fairies!

52
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,344
Mistress Flora,

53
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,980
Mistress Fauna...

54
00:05:21,056 --> 00:05:23,991
and Mistress Merryweather!

55
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:37,166
- Oh!
- Oh!
- The little darling.

56
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:42,507
- Your Majesties.
- Your Majesties.
- Your Majesties.

57
00:05:42,577 --> 00:05:46,536
Each of us the child
may bless with a single gift,

58
00:05:46,614 --> 00:05:48,878
no more, no less.

59
00:05:52,815 --> 00:05:55,079
Little Princess,

60
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,085
my gift shall be
the gift of beauty.

61
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,853
One gift

62
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:08,761
Beauty rare

63
00:06:08,831 --> 00:06:12,062
Gold of sunshine

64
00:06:12,134 --> 00:06:15,763
In her hair

65
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:22,937
Lips that shame
the red, red rose

66
00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:25,742
She'll walk with springtime

67
00:06:25,814 --> 00:06:30,478
Wherever she goes

68
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:39,283
Tiny Princess,

69
00:06:39,361 --> 00:06:42,489
my gift shall be
the gift of song.

70
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:52,067
One gift

71
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:56,271
The gift of song

72
00:06:56,345 --> 00:07:02,511
Melody her whole life long

73
00:07:02,584 --> 00:07:09,990
The nightingale's
her troubadour

74
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:18,433
Bringing his sweet serenade
to her door

75
00:07:24,106 --> 00:07:28,167
Sweet Princess,
my gift shall be the--

76
00:07:50,932 --> 00:07:55,528
- Why, it's Maleficent.
- What does she want here?
- Shh!

77
00:07:55,603 --> 00:08:00,370
Well, quite a glittering
assemblage, King Stefan.

78
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:03,638
Royalty, nobility,

79
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:06,373
the gentry, and--

80
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,214
How quaint.
Even the rabble.

81
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:16,019
I really felt quite distressed
at not receiving an invitation.

82
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,059
- You weren't wanted.
- Not wa--

83
00:08:21,296 --> 00:08:24,561
Oh, dear, what
an awkward situation.

84
00:08:24,632 --> 00:08:27,999
I had hoped it was merely due
to some oversight.

85
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:30,697
Well, in that event,
I'd best be on my way.

86
00:08:30,772 --> 00:08:34,367
And you're not offended,
Your Excellency?

87
00:08:34,442 --> 00:08:38,173
Why, no, Your Majesty.

88
00:08:38,246 --> 00:08:41,079
And to show
I bear no ill will,

89
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:44,744
I, too, shall bestow
a gift on the child.

90
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:49,081
Listen well, all of you.

91
00:08:50,825 --> 00:08:56,195
The Princess shall indeed
grow in grace and beauty,

92
00:08:56,264 --> 00:08:59,131
beloved by all who know her.

93
00:09:00,702 --> 00:09:03,364
But...

94
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:07,101
before the sun sets on
her sixteenth birthday,

95
00:09:07,175 --> 00:09:11,942
she shall prick her finger
on the spindle of a spinning wheel...

96
00:09:12,013 --> 00:09:13,605
and die.

97
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:16,275
Oh, no!

98
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:18,444
Seize that creature!

99
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,919
Stand back, you fools!

100
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:34,797
Don't despair, Your Majesties.

101
00:09:34,869 --> 00:09:37,736
Merryweather still
has her gift to give.

102
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:41,104
Then she can undo
this fearful curse?

103
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:42,836
Oh, no, Sire.

104
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,107
Maleficent's powers
are far too great.

105
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,774
But she can help.

106
00:09:50,084 --> 00:09:52,848
- But--
-Just do your best, dear.

107
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,251
Yes, go on.

108
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:57,983
Sweet Princess,

109
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:00,755
if through this
wicked witch's trick...

110
00:10:00,828 --> 00:10:03,296
a spindle should
your finger prick,

111
00:10:03,364 --> 00:10:06,595
a ray of hope there
still may be in this,

112
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:09,602
the gift I give to thee.

113
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,332
Not in death,
but just in sleep...

114
00:10:12,406 --> 00:10:14,840
the fateful prophecy
you'll keep.

115
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:17,309
And from this slumber
you shall wake...

116
00:10:17,378 --> 00:10:20,814
when true love's kiss
the spell shall break.

117
00:10:22,383 --> 00:10:25,546
For true love

118
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:31,489
Conquers all

119
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,321
But King Stefan, still fearful
of his daughter's life,

120
00:10:37,398 --> 00:10:41,357
did then and there decree that every
spinning wheel in the kingdom...

121
00:10:41,435 --> 00:10:44,404
should on that very day
be burned.

122
00:10:44,472 --> 00:10:46,872
So 'twas done.

123
00:11:02,656 --> 00:11:05,853
Oh, silly fiddle-faddle!

124
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:10,396
Now, come have
a nice cup of tea, dear.

125
00:11:10,464 --> 00:11:12,694
I'm sure it'll
work out somehow.

126
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:15,735
Well, a bonfire
won't stop Maleficent.

127
00:11:15,803 --> 00:11:17,998
Of course not.
But what will?

128
00:11:18,072 --> 00:11:21,007
- Well, perhaps if we reason with her.
- Reason?

129
00:11:21,075 --> 00:11:24,044
- With Maleficent?
- Well, she can't be all bad.

130
00:11:24,111 --> 00:11:26,079
Oh, yes, she can!

131
00:11:26,147 --> 00:11:30,846
Ooh, I'd like to turn her
into a fat, old hoptoad.

132
00:11:30,918 --> 00:11:34,115
Now, dear, that isn't
a very nice thing to say.

133
00:11:34,188 --> 00:11:37,715
Besides, we can't. You know
our magic doesn't work that way.

134
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:41,249
It can only do good, dear,
to bring joy and happiness.

135
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:43,455
Well, that would
make me happy.

136
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,098
But there must be some way.

137
00:11:47,634 --> 00:11:49,602
- There is!
- There is?

138
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,764
- What is it, Flora?
- I'm going to--

139
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,435
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!
Even walls have ears.

140
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:03,645
Follow me.

141
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:20,159
I'll turn her into a flower.

142
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:23,761
- Maleficent?
- Oh, no, dear. The Princess.

143
00:12:23,837 --> 00:12:26,431
Oh, she'd make
a lovely flower.

144
00:12:26,507 --> 00:12:29,271
Don't you see? A flower
can't prick its finger.

145
00:12:29,343 --> 00:12:31,743
- It hasn't any.
- That's right.

146
00:12:31,812 --> 00:12:35,805
- She'll be perfectly safe.
- Until Maleficent sends a frost.

147
00:12:35,883 --> 00:12:39,580
Yes! Eh-- Oh, dear.

148
00:12:39,653 --> 00:12:42,952
She always ruins
your nicest flowers.

149
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:47,357
You're right. And she'll be
expecting us to do something like that.

150
00:12:47,427 --> 00:12:52,592
Oh! Well, what won't she expect?
She knows everything.

151
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,657
Oh, but she doesn't, dear.

152
00:12:54,735 --> 00:12:57,499
Maleficent doesn't know
anything about love...

153
00:12:57,571 --> 00:13:02,270
or kindness or the joy
of helping others.

154
00:13:02,342 --> 00:13:05,834
You know, sometimes I don't
think she's really very happy.

155
00:13:05,913 --> 00:13:08,711
That's it! Of course.

156
00:13:08,782 --> 00:13:12,377
It's the only thing she can't
understand and won't expect.

157
00:13:14,121 --> 00:13:16,681
Now, now, now, we'll have
to plan it carefully.

158
00:13:16,757 --> 00:13:20,693
Let's see. The woodcutter's cottage.
Yes, yes, the abandoned one.

159
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:23,229
Of course, the King
and Queen will object.

160
00:13:23,297 --> 00:13:25,822
But when we explain
it's the only way--

161
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:28,993
Explain what?

162
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:32,903
About the three peasant women
raising a foundling child...

163
00:13:32,973 --> 00:13:35,203
deep in the forest.

164
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:39,905
- Oh? Oh, that's very nice of them.
- Who are they?

165
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,881
Turn around.

166
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,714
- Eww!
- Why, it's us!

167
00:13:45,786 --> 00:13:48,653
- Uh-huh.
- You mean, ''we'' us?

168
00:13:48,722 --> 00:13:50,713
- Uh-huh.
- Take care of the baby?

169
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:54,557
- Why not?
- Oh, I'd like that!

170
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:57,062
Well, y-yes, but w-w-we'd
have to feed it a--

171
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,588
And wash it and dress it
and rock it to sleep.

172
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:03,659
- Oh, I'd love it.
- Do you really think we can?

173
00:14:03,737 --> 00:14:05,898
If humans can do it,
so can we.

174
00:14:05,973 --> 00:14:09,409
- And we'd have our magic to help us.
- That's right.

175
00:14:09,476 --> 00:14:12,775
No, no, no, no, no, no!
No magic!

176
00:14:12,846 --> 00:14:15,178
I'll take those wands
right now.

177
00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:17,740
Oh, better get rid
of those wings too.

178
00:14:17,818 --> 00:14:21,948
You mean live like mortals?
For sixteen years?

179
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:25,753
- Uh-huh.
- B-Bu-- Now, now, we--
we don't know how.

180
00:14:25,826 --> 00:14:27,760
We've never done anything
without magic.

181
00:14:27,828 --> 00:14:30,228
And that's why Maleficent
will never suspect--

182
00:14:30,297 --> 00:14:32,231
- But-- But who'll wash?
- And cook?

183
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:35,393
- Oh, we'll all pitch in.
- I'll take care of the baby.

184
00:14:35,469 --> 00:14:38,370
Let me have it, dear.

185
00:14:38,438 --> 00:14:42,431
Come along now. We must tell
their Majesties at once.

186
00:14:45,979 --> 00:14:48,641
- Flora?
- Flora?

187
00:14:54,521 --> 00:14:57,957
So the King and his Queen
watched with heavy hearts...

188
00:14:58,025 --> 00:15:01,586
as their most precious
possession, their only child,

189
00:15:01,662 --> 00:15:03,926
disappeared into the night.

190
00:15:16,576 --> 00:15:19,306
Many sad and lonely years
passed by...

191
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:22,940
for King Stefan
and his people.

192
00:15:23,016 --> 00:15:27,146
But as the time for the Princess's
sixteenth birthday drew near,

193
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,986
the entire kingdom
began to rejoice.

194
00:15:31,058 --> 00:15:34,653
For everyone knew that
as long as Maleficent's domain,

195
00:15:34,728 --> 00:15:39,427
the Forbidden Mountains, thundered
with her wrath and frustration,

196
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:42,434
her evil prophecy
had not yet been fulfilled.

197
00:15:54,243 --> 00:15:56,905
It's incredible!

198
00:15:56,979 --> 00:16:00,881
Sixteen years,
and not a trace of her.

199
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:04,316
She couldn't have vanished
into thin air!

200
00:16:04,386 --> 00:16:08,379
Are you sure you
searched everywhere?

201
00:16:08,457 --> 00:16:10,823
Yes, yes, uh, everywhere.

202
00:16:10,892 --> 00:16:12,883
- We all did.
- Yeah, yeah!

203
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:15,054
Uh-huh, yeah.

204
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,928
And what about the town?
The forest? The mountains?

205
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,231
Yeah, we searched mountains,
uh, uh, uh, uh, forests...

206
00:16:21,303 --> 00:16:23,931
and, uh, houses, and, uh--

207
00:16:24,006 --> 00:16:26,907
Let me see.
Uh, and all the cradles.

208
00:16:26,975 --> 00:16:30,411
- Cradle?
- Yep, yep.

209
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,606
Every cradle.

210
00:16:32,681 --> 00:16:35,206
Cradle?

211
00:16:35,284 --> 00:16:37,878
Did you hear that, my pet?

212
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:42,720
All these years, they've
been looking for a baby.

213
00:16:54,503 --> 00:16:56,937
Fools!

214
00:16:57,005 --> 00:17:00,099
Idiots! Imbeciles!

215
00:17:15,357 --> 00:17:17,450
Oh, they're hopeless.

216
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:21,121
A disgrace to
the forces of evil.

217
00:17:23,465 --> 00:17:27,799
My pet, you are my last hope.

218
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:30,633
Circle far and wide.

219
00:17:30,706 --> 00:17:33,402
Search for a maid
of sixteen...

220
00:17:33,475 --> 00:17:35,807
with hair of sunshine gold...

221
00:17:35,877 --> 00:17:38,675
and lips red as the rose.

222
00:17:38,747 --> 00:17:42,308
Go, and do not fail me.

223
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:50,016
And so, for sixteen long years,

224
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:53,520
the whereabouts of the Princess
remained a mystery.

225
00:17:53,588 --> 00:17:56,716
While deep in the forest
in a woodcutter's cottage,

226
00:17:56,791 --> 00:18:00,625
the good fairies carried out
their well-laid plan.

227
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:04,392
Living like mortals, they had
reared the child as their own...

228
00:18:04,465 --> 00:18:07,901
and called her Briar Rose.

229
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,408
On this, her sixteenth birthday,

230
00:18:14,475 --> 00:18:16,739
the good fairies
had planned a party...

231
00:18:16,811 --> 00:18:20,872
and something extra special
for a surprise.

232
00:18:20,949 --> 00:18:24,043
- Well, now, how about this one?
- This is the one I picked.

233
00:18:24,118 --> 00:18:26,177
Oh, she'll look
beautiful in that.

234
00:18:26,254 --> 00:18:28,722
- Now, I thought a few changes here.
- Uh-huh.

235
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,385
- And don't forget a pretty bow.
- Yes, and raise the shoulder line.

236
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,860
- We'll make it blue.
- Oh, no, dear, pink.

237
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:36,863
- But--
- Of course, we'll need a few pleats.

238
00:18:36,931 --> 00:18:39,331
Yes, but how are we gonna
get her out of the house?

239
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,527
Oh, I'll think of something.

240
00:18:41,602 --> 00:18:45,402
Well, and what are
you three dears up to?

241
00:18:45,473 --> 00:18:47,600
- Up to?
- Up to?
- Up to?

242
00:18:47,675 --> 00:18:49,666
Uh, uh-- Th-Th-The--
Cr-- Uh--

243
00:18:49,744 --> 00:18:52,076
Well, we-- Uh, we-- W-We--

244
00:18:52,146 --> 00:18:56,105
- We want you to pick some berries.
- That's it, berries!

245
00:18:56,184 --> 00:18:58,584
- Berries?
- Lots of berries.

246
00:18:58,653 --> 00:19:02,783
- But I-I picked berries yesterday.
- Oh, w-we need more, dear.

247
00:19:02,857 --> 00:19:05,917
- Lots, lots more.
- Yes!

248
00:19:07,328 --> 00:19:10,422
- Now don't hurry back, dear.
- But don't go too far.

249
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:12,932
- And don't speak to strangers.
- Good-bye, dear.

250
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:16,459
- Good-bye!
- Good-bye!
- Good-bye!

251
00:19:17,972 --> 00:19:21,430
- I wonder if she suspects.
- Of course not.

252
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:24,876
Come on!
Oh, will she be surprised.

253
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:27,039
A real birthday party.

254
00:19:27,115 --> 00:19:29,083
With a real birthday cake.

255
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:32,051
Yes, and a dress
a princess can be proud of.

256
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,284
- I'll get the wands.
- Yes, you can, uh-- The wands?

257
00:19:36,357 --> 00:19:39,155
- Oh, no!
- No magic!

258
00:19:39,227 --> 00:19:41,627
But the sixteen years
are almost over.

259
00:19:41,696 --> 00:19:43,891
We're taking no chances.

260
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:46,900
But I've never baked
a fancy cake.

261
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,993
Oh, you won't have to, dear.

262
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,231
I'm going to bake the cake.

263
00:19:51,305 --> 00:19:53,967
- You?
- Oh, she's always wanted to, dear.

264
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:56,476
- And this is her last chance.
- Well--

265
00:19:56,544 --> 00:20:00,344
I'm going to make it fifteen layers
with pink and blue forget-me-nots.

266
00:20:00,415 --> 00:20:02,849
And I'm making the dress.

267
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:05,977
But you can't sew,
and she's never cooked.

268
00:20:06,054 --> 00:20:09,854
- Oh-ho-ho, it's simple!
- All you do is follow the book.

269
00:20:09,924 --> 00:20:13,792
Up here, dear.
You can be the dummy.

270
00:20:13,861 --> 00:20:17,353
Well, I still say
we ought to use magic.

271
00:20:23,838 --> 00:20:26,773
''Flour, three cups.''

272
00:20:26,841 --> 00:20:29,833
Cups, cups, cups, cups,
cups, cups, cups.

273
00:20:29,911 --> 00:20:32,778
Oh.

274
00:20:32,847 --> 00:20:36,010
One, two, three.

275
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:40,111
- What's that for?
- Well, it's got to have
a hole in the bottom.

276
00:20:40,188 --> 00:20:43,624
That's for the feet
to go through.

277
00:20:45,693 --> 00:20:49,129
- It's pink.
- Oh, lovely shade, isn't it?

278
00:20:49,197 --> 00:20:52,860
- But I wanted it blue.
- Now, dear,

279
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:55,164
we decided
pink was her color.

280
00:20:55,236 --> 00:20:58,330
You decided!

281
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,209
''Two eggs. Fold in gently.''

282
00:21:13,287 --> 00:21:15,915
Fold? Uh, oh, well.

283
00:21:20,461 --> 00:21:23,555
I can't breathe!

284
00:21:23,631 --> 00:21:26,327
Let me out of here.

285
00:21:28,136 --> 00:21:31,663
- It looks awful.
- That's because it's on you, dear.

286
00:21:31,739 --> 00:21:35,175
''Now, yeast, one tsp.''
''Tsp.''?

287
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:37,507
One teaspoon.

288
00:21:37,578 --> 00:21:40,570
- Oh, one teaspoon, of course!
- Hmm!

289
00:21:46,921 --> 00:21:50,379
Oh, gracious,
how that child has grown.

290
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,791
Oh, it seems only yesterday
we brought her here.

291
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:56,591
Just a tiny baby.

292
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,436
- Why, Merryweather.
- What ever is the matter, dear?

293
00:22:03,504 --> 00:22:06,029
After today,
she'll be a princess,

294
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:08,940
and we won't have
any Briar Rose.

295
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,308
- Oh, Flora!
- Now, now, now, now.

296
00:22:11,379 --> 00:22:15,110
Well, we-- we all knew
this day had to come.

297
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:17,947
But why did it
have to come so soon?

298
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:22,080
After all, we've had her
for sixteen years.

299
00:22:22,156 --> 00:22:24,590
Sixteen wonderful years.

300
00:22:27,995 --> 00:22:31,453
Oh, gracious! We're acting
like a lot of ninnies.

301
00:22:31,532 --> 00:22:35,468
Come on. She'll be back
before we get started.

302
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,571
You hear that, Samson?

303
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,108
Beautiful.

304
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:32,443
What is it?

305
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:36,109
Come on.
Let's find out.

306
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:39,746
Aw, come on.
For an extra bucket of oats?

307
00:24:41,156 --> 00:24:44,614
And a few carrots?

308
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:47,093
Hup, boy!

309
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:19,118
Whoa!

310
00:25:31,106 --> 00:25:33,472
No carrots.

311
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,853
I wonder

312
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:52,360
I wonder

313
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:56,727
I wonder why
each little bird

314
00:25:56,798 --> 00:25:59,460
Has a someone

315
00:25:59,534 --> 00:26:02,628
To sing to

316
00:26:02,704 --> 00:26:05,901
Sweet things to

317
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:11,412
A gay little love melody

318
00:26:13,648 --> 00:26:17,084
I wonder

319
00:26:17,152 --> 00:26:20,053
I wonder

320
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:23,751
If my heart keeps singing

321
00:26:23,825 --> 00:26:27,556
Will my song go winging

322
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:30,928
To someone

323
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:34,560
Who'll find me

324
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:40,097
And bring back a love song

325
00:26:40,175 --> 00:26:44,441
To me

326
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:51,415
Oh, dear.

327
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:55,354
Why do they still
treat me like a child?

328
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,853
Who?

329
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:03,057
Aunt Flora and Fauna
and Merryweather.

330
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,094
They never want me
to meet anyone.

331
00:27:12,207 --> 00:27:14,437
But you know something?

332
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:16,739
I fooled them.

333
00:27:16,811 --> 00:27:19,439
I have met someone.

334
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:21,311
Who?

335
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:26,544
Who? Who?

336
00:27:26,621 --> 00:27:29,590
Oh, a prince.

337
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,724
Well, he's tall
and handsome and--

338
00:27:35,797 --> 00:27:37,788
and so romantic.

339
00:27:40,569 --> 00:27:45,302
Oh, we walk together
and talk together;

340
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:48,570
and just before
we say good-bye,

341
00:27:48,643 --> 00:27:51,510
he takes me in his arms...

342
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,811
and then...

343
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:57,181
I wake up.

344
00:27:59,854 --> 00:28:02,652
Yes, it's only in my dreams.

345
00:28:04,025 --> 00:28:06,493
But they say if you dream
a thing more than once,

346
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:08,688
it's sure to come true;

347
00:28:08,763 --> 00:28:12,199
and I've seen him
so many times.

348
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:55,641
You know, Samson,

349
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:59,510
there was something strange
about that voice.

350
00:28:59,581 --> 00:29:03,176
Too beautiful to be real.

351
00:29:03,251 --> 00:29:07,415
Maybe it was some mysterious
being, a wood sprite or a--

352
00:29:10,158 --> 00:29:12,558
Here, stop!

353
00:29:42,423 --> 00:29:45,256
Why, it's my dream prince.

354
00:29:48,696 --> 00:29:51,426
Your Highness.

355
00:29:57,205 --> 00:30:00,402
You know, I'm really not
supposed to speak to strangers,

356
00:30:00,475 --> 00:30:02,875
but we've met before.

357
00:30:02,944 --> 00:30:05,435
I know you

358
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:11,076
I walked with you
once upon a dream

359
00:30:11,152 --> 00:30:13,780
I know you

360
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:15,982
The gleam in your eyes

361
00:30:16,057 --> 00:30:19,390
Is so familiar a gleam

362
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,952
Yet I know it's true

363
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:27,798
That visions
are seldom all they seem

364
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:30,394
But if I know you

365
00:30:30,471 --> 00:30:32,962
I know what you'll do

366
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:36,272
You'll love me at once

367
00:30:36,344 --> 00:30:43,773
The way you did
once upon a dream

368
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,090
But if I know you

369
00:30:55,163 --> 00:30:58,098
I know what you'll do

370
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:00,999
You'll love me at once

371
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:03,003
- The way you--
- The way you did

372
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:07,838
Once upon a dream

373
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:11,768
Oh! Oh!

374
00:31:11,846 --> 00:31:15,179
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

375
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:17,774
Oh, it, uh, wasn't that.

376
00:31:17,852 --> 00:31:20,548
It's just that you're a-- a--

377
00:31:20,622 --> 00:31:22,852
- A stranger?
- Mm-hmm.

378
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:25,654
But don't you remember?
We've met before.

379
00:31:25,727 --> 00:31:29,219
- We-- We have?
- Why, of course. You said so yourself.

380
00:31:29,297 --> 00:31:31,197
Once upon a dream.

381
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:33,859
I know you

382
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:39,703
I walked with you
once upon a dream

383
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:42,538
I know you

384
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:48,640
The gleam in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam

385
00:31:48,716 --> 00:31:55,178
And I know it's true

386
00:31:55,256 --> 00:32:01,058
That visions
are seldom all they seem

387
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:04,565
But if I know you

388
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:07,396
I know what you'll do

389
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:10,733
You'll love me at once

390
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:13,501
The way you did

391
00:32:13,574 --> 00:32:22,243
Once upon a dream

392
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:30,048
Who are you?

393
00:32:30,124 --> 00:32:32,422
What's your name?

394
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:34,620
Hmm?

395
00:32:34,696 --> 00:32:37,392
Oh, my name.

396
00:32:37,465 --> 00:32:40,127
Why, it's-- it's--

397
00:32:40,201 --> 00:32:43,034
Oh, no, no, I can't! I--

398
00:32:43,104 --> 00:32:45,368
- Good-bye!
- But when will I see you again?

399
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,103
- Oh, never! Never!
- Never?

400
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:52,977
- Well, maybe someday.
- When? Tomorrow?

401
00:32:53,047 --> 00:32:55,811
Oh, no! This evening!

402
00:32:55,883 --> 00:32:59,319
- Where?
- At the cottage in the glen.

403
00:33:08,189 --> 00:33:10,521
There. Ooh!

404
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:19,495
- Well, what do you think of it?
- Why, it's--

405
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:22,661
It's a very unusual cake,
isn't it?

406
00:33:22,737 --> 00:33:26,935
Yes. Of course, it'll be
much stiffer after it's baked.

407
00:33:27,008 --> 00:33:31,001
Of course, dear. Um, what
do you think of the dress?

408
00:33:31,078 --> 00:33:33,103
Well, i-it's, uh--

409
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,775
I-It's not exactly the way
it is in the book, is it?

410
00:33:36,851 --> 00:33:38,876
Oh, I improved it.

411
00:33:38,953 --> 00:33:43,515
But perhaps if I added a few more
ruffles, uh-- Uh, what do you think?

412
00:33:43,591 --> 00:33:48,654
Um, I think so.
What do you think, Merryweather?

413
00:33:48,729 --> 00:33:52,665
I think we've had enough
of this nonsense!

414
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:57,329
I think we ought to think of Rose
and what she'll think of this mess.

415
00:33:57,405 --> 00:33:59,999
I still think
what I thunk before.

416
00:34:00,074 --> 00:34:02,634
I'm going to get those wands.

417
00:34:04,445 --> 00:34:08,347
You know, I think she's right.

418
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:10,748
Here they are, good as new.

419
00:34:10,818 --> 00:34:15,016
Ah, ah, ah!
C-C-C-C-C-Careful, Merryweather!

420
00:34:15,089 --> 00:34:18,024
Quick, lock the doors.

421
00:34:18,092 --> 00:34:22,927
Uh, Fauna, you close the windows.
Oh, block up every cranny.

422
00:34:22,997 --> 00:34:26,433
We can't take any chances.

423
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,060
Now, you take care
of the cake.

424
00:34:29,136 --> 00:34:31,536
- While I--
- Clean the room, dear.

425
00:34:31,605 --> 00:34:35,063
And I'll make the dress.
Now hurry!

426
00:34:35,142 --> 00:34:37,235
Ooh!

427
00:34:38,479 --> 00:34:40,947
Come on, bucket, mop, broom.

428
00:34:41,015 --> 00:34:43,609
Flora says clean up the room.

429
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,924
And now to make
a lovely dress...

430
00:34:54,995 --> 00:34:57,862
fit to grace a fair princess.

431
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:03,068
Eggs, flour, minute--

432
00:35:03,137 --> 00:35:07,301
Just do it like it says here
in the book. I'll put on the candles.

433
00:36:01,689 --> 00:36:05,022
Oh, no, not pink.
Make it blue.

434
00:36:06,394 --> 00:36:08,988
Merryweather!
Make it pink.

435
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,534
Make it blue.

436
00:36:16,637 --> 00:36:18,662
Oh, pink!

437
00:36:21,075 --> 00:36:23,839
Blue.

438
00:37:14,495 --> 00:37:17,862
Ohh, now look
what you've done!

439
00:37:18,933 --> 00:37:21,595
Shh, shh, shh! Listen.

440
00:37:21,669 --> 00:37:25,571
- It's Rose.
- She's back. Enough
of this foolishness.

441
00:37:29,343 --> 00:37:33,302
Make it pink.
Now hide, quick!

442
00:37:35,683 --> 00:37:38,481
- Blue.
- Aunt Flora!

443
00:37:41,021 --> 00:37:44,616
Good gracious!
Who left the mop running?

444
00:37:45,726 --> 00:37:47,626
Stop, mop.

445
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,124
Aunt Flora! Fauna!

446
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:54,633
Merryweather!

447
00:37:56,704 --> 00:38:00,800
Where is everybody? Oh!

448
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:03,241
- Surprise! Surprise!
- Surprise! Surprise!
- Surprise!

449
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:06,473
- Happy birthday!
- Oh, you darlings!

450
00:38:06,547 --> 00:38:09,175
This is the happiest day
of my life.

451
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,616
Everything's so wonderful.

452
00:38:11,685 --> 00:38:14,813
-Just wait 'til you meet him.
- Him?

453
00:38:14,889 --> 00:38:18,916
- Rose!
- Y-You've met some stranger?

454
00:38:18,993 --> 00:38:22,360
Oh, he's not a stranger.
We've met before.

455
00:38:22,429 --> 00:38:24,659
- You have?
- Where?

456
00:38:24,732 --> 00:38:27,166
Once upon a dream.

457
00:38:27,234 --> 00:38:29,532
I know you

458
00:38:29,603 --> 00:38:35,599
I walked with you
once upon a dream

459
00:38:35,676 --> 00:38:38,270
- She's in love!
- Oh, no.

460
00:38:38,345 --> 00:38:40,677
This is terrible.

461
00:38:40,748 --> 00:38:44,013
Why? After all,
I am sixteen.

462
00:38:44,084 --> 00:38:47,679
- It isn't that, dear.
- You're already betrothed.

463
00:38:47,755 --> 00:38:50,485
- Betrothed?
- Since the day you were born.

464
00:38:50,558 --> 00:38:54,517
- To Prince Phillip, dear.
- But that's impossible.

465
00:38:54,595 --> 00:38:57,530
How could I marry a prince?
I'd have to be--

466
00:38:57,598 --> 00:39:00,123
- A princess.
- And you are, dear.

467
00:39:00,201 --> 00:39:02,328
Princess Aurora.

468
00:39:02,403 --> 00:39:06,203
Tonight, we're taking you back
to your father, King Stefan.

469
00:39:06,273 --> 00:39:08,741
But-- But I can't.

470
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:12,176
He's coming here tonight.
I promised to meet him.

471
00:39:12,246 --> 00:39:17,377
I'm sorry, child, but you must
never see that young man again.

472
00:39:17,451 --> 00:39:20,477
Oh, no! No!

473
00:39:20,554 --> 00:39:24,752
I can't believe it! No! No!

474
00:39:29,496 --> 00:39:32,556
And we thought
she'd be so happy.

475
00:39:47,714 --> 00:39:50,581
No sign of her yet, Hubert.

476
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:54,848
'Course not. It's a good
half hour 'til sunset.

477
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:01,687
Ah, excellent bird.

478
00:40:03,063 --> 00:40:05,497
Oh, now, come, man!

479
00:40:05,565 --> 00:40:07,999
Buck up! Battle's over!

480
00:40:08,068 --> 00:40:10,536
Girl's as good as here.

481
00:40:10,604 --> 00:40:13,801
I'm sorry, Hubert,
but after sixteen years...

482
00:40:13,874 --> 00:40:16,240
of worrying, never knowing--

483
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:19,073
The past! All in the past.

484
00:40:25,151 --> 00:40:28,587
Tonight, we toast
the future...

485
00:40:28,654 --> 00:40:32,249
with something I've been saving
for sixteen years.

486
00:40:35,161 --> 00:40:37,652
Here. To the future!

487
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:40,324
Right, Hubert.
To the future.

488
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:46,666
-Skumps, skumps
-Skumps

489
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:50,402
-A toast to this night
- The outlook is rosy

490
00:40:50,476 --> 00:40:52,307
The future is bright

491
00:40:52,378 --> 00:40:56,439
Our children will marry
Our kingdoms unite

492
00:40:56,515 --> 00:40:59,006
Skumps, skumps

493
00:40:59,085 --> 00:41:01,679
Skumps

494
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:07,858
Ah, excellent vintage.

495
00:41:13,065 --> 00:41:16,660
- And now, to the new home, eh?
- New home?

496
00:41:16,736 --> 00:41:19,204
Children need a nest
of their own, what?

497
00:41:19,272 --> 00:41:22,673
Place to raise
their little brood, eh?

498
00:41:22,742 --> 00:41:25,006
Well, I suppose in time--

499
00:41:25,077 --> 00:41:27,705
Of course! To the home!

500
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,543
-Skumps
-Skumps

501
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:32,846
-A toast to the home
- One grander by far

502
00:41:32,919 --> 00:41:34,887
Than a palace in Rome

503
00:41:34,954 --> 00:41:38,947
Uh, let me fill up your glass.
That glass was all foam.

504
00:41:39,025 --> 00:41:41,516
Skumps, skumps

505
00:41:41,594 --> 00:41:43,960
Skumps

506
00:41:51,737 --> 00:41:54,331
The plans!

507
00:41:58,878 --> 00:42:02,336
Well, what do you think?
Nothing elaborate, of course.

508
00:42:02,415 --> 00:42:06,317
Forty bedrooms, dining hall.
Honeymoon cottage, really.

509
00:42:06,385 --> 00:42:09,650
You-- You mean, you're
building it already?

510
00:42:09,722 --> 00:42:13,419
Built, man! Finished!
Lovebirds can move in tomorrow.

511
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:17,986
Tomorrow? But, Hubert,
they're not even married yet.

512
00:42:18,064 --> 00:42:20,897
Take care of that tonight.
To the wedding!

513
00:42:20,967 --> 00:42:24,698
Now hold on, Hubert. I haven't
even seen my daughter yet,

514
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,738
and you're taking her
away from me.

515
00:42:26,806 --> 00:42:29,172
-Getting my Phillip, aren't you?
-Yes, but--

516
00:42:29,241 --> 00:42:31,505
Want to see our grandchildren,
don't we?

517
00:42:31,577 --> 00:42:34,205
- Of course, but, uh--
- There's no time to lose.

518
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,613
Getting on in years.

519
00:42:37,683 --> 00:42:41,119
- To the wedding!
- Now, be reasonable, Hubert.

520
00:42:41,187 --> 00:42:44,918
After all, Aurora knows
nothing about all this.

521
00:42:44,991 --> 00:42:50,691
- Well?
- Well, it-- it may come
as quite a shock.

522
00:42:50,763 --> 00:42:54,290
Shock? My Phillip, a shock?

523
00:42:54,367 --> 00:42:57,063
What's wrong
with my Phillip?

524
00:42:57,136 --> 00:42:59,604
Nothing, Hubert.
I only meant--

525
00:42:59,672 --> 00:43:02,800
Why doesn't your daughter
like my son?

526
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:05,969
- Now, now--
- I'm not so sure...

527
00:43:06,045 --> 00:43:08,809
my son likes your daughter!

528
00:43:08,881 --> 00:43:12,373
- Now, see here.
- I'm not so sure my grandchildren...

529
00:43:12,451 --> 00:43:14,885
want you for a grandfather!

530
00:43:14,954 --> 00:43:17,650
Why, you, you unreasonable,

531
00:43:17,723 --> 00:43:20,954
- Huh? Who? Uh--
- pompous, blustering, old windbag!

532
00:43:21,027 --> 00:43:24,326
Unreasonable, pompous--
On guard, sir!

533
00:43:24,397 --> 00:43:26,957
I warn you, Hubert,
this means war.

534
00:43:27,033 --> 00:43:30,230
Forward! For honor!
For country!

535
00:43:30,302 --> 00:43:33,237
Oh! Ohh!

536
00:43:38,744 --> 00:43:41,144
- Hey.
- What's this all about, anyway?

537
00:43:41,213 --> 00:43:44,979
No-- Nothing, Hubert.
Absolutely nothing!

538
00:43:45,051 --> 00:43:47,679
Eh, children bound to fall
in love with each other.

539
00:43:47,753 --> 00:43:51,154
Yeah. Precisely.
And as for grandchildren,

540
00:43:51,223 --> 00:43:55,125
I'll have the royal woodcarvers
start work on the cradle tomorrow.

541
00:43:55,194 --> 00:43:58,129
Splendid!
King-size, of course.

542
00:43:58,197 --> 00:44:01,325
Certainly.
To the woodcarvers guild.

543
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:19,149
His Royal Highness,
Prince Phillip!

544
00:44:19,218 --> 00:44:21,686
Phillip?

545
00:44:26,725 --> 00:44:30,320
Oh, Phillip! Phillip!

546
00:44:30,396 --> 00:44:32,489
Phillip! Ho, Phillip!

547
00:44:38,804 --> 00:44:40,897
H-Hurry, boy, hurry!

548
00:44:40,973 --> 00:44:43,032
Uh, change into
something suitable.

549
00:44:43,108 --> 00:44:45,508
Can't meet your future bride
looking like that.

550
00:44:45,578 --> 00:44:49,014
- But I have met her, Father.
- Yeah-- You have? Where?

551
00:44:49,081 --> 00:44:51,379
Once upon a dream.

552
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:55,079
Oh, Phillip! Stop it!
Stop that! Wa-- Phillip!

553
00:44:55,154 --> 00:44:57,088
Phi-- Put me down!

554
00:44:57,156 --> 00:45:00,353
Now, what's all
this ''dream'' nonsense?

555
00:45:00,426 --> 00:45:03,190
It wasn't a dream, Father.
I really did meet her.

556
00:45:03,262 --> 00:45:06,720
Oh, the Princess Aurora? Good
heavens, we must tell Stefan.

557
00:45:06,799 --> 00:45:09,768
-Why, this is the most amazing--
-I-I didn't say it was Aurora.

558
00:45:09,835 --> 00:45:11,769
You most certainly did.
You-- You said--

559
00:45:11,837 --> 00:45:15,238
I said I met the girl I was going
to marry. I don't know who she was.

560
00:45:15,307 --> 00:45:18,868
- A peasant girl, I suppose.
- A-- A peasant g-girl?

561
00:45:18,944 --> 00:45:21,105
You-- You're going
to marry a g--

562
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,240
Why, Phillip, you're joking.

563
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:31,178
Isn't he?

564
00:45:31,257 --> 00:45:34,556
Oh! Y-Y-You can't
do this to me.

565
00:45:34,627 --> 00:45:39,587
Give up the throne, the kingdom,
for some-- some nobody?

566
00:45:39,665 --> 00:45:42,099
By Harry, I won't have it!

567
00:45:42,167 --> 00:45:45,694
You're a prince, and you're
going to marry a princess!

568
00:45:45,771 --> 00:45:47,864
Now, Father,
you're living in the past.

569
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,965
This is the fourteenth century.
Nowadays--

570
00:45:50,042 --> 00:45:54,479
Nowadays I'm still the king! And I
command you to come to your senses!

571
00:45:54,546 --> 00:45:56,480
- And marry the girl I love.
- Exactly!

572
00:45:56,548 --> 00:46:00,314
- Good-bye, Father.
- Good-bye, Father.
Marry the girl you-- No, no!

573
00:46:00,386 --> 00:46:02,980
No, no, Phillip!
Stop! Come back!

574
00:46:03,055 --> 00:46:05,319
Oh, Phillip!

575
00:46:09,728 --> 00:46:12,663
Phillip!

576
00:46:33,018 --> 00:46:36,977
How-- How will I
ever tell Stefan?

577
00:47:22,661 --> 00:47:25,152
Come along now.

578
00:47:36,308 --> 00:47:39,243
All right. In here, dear.

579
00:47:43,282 --> 00:47:45,750
- Oh!
- Bolt the door, Merryweather.

580
00:47:45,817 --> 00:47:48,752
Fauna, pull the drapes.

581
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:53,621
And now, dear,
if you'll just sit here.

582
00:47:53,692 --> 00:47:58,254
This one last gift,
dear child, for thee,

583
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:01,390
the symbol of thy royalty:

584
00:48:01,466 --> 00:48:05,129
a crown to wear
in grace and beauty,

585
00:48:05,203 --> 00:48:08,297
as is thy right
and royal duty.

586
00:48:12,711 --> 00:48:16,044
- Now, dear--
- Come.

587
00:48:18,617 --> 00:48:21,984
Let her have
a few moments alone.

588
00:48:22,054 --> 00:48:24,318
It's that boy she met.

589
00:48:24,389 --> 00:48:26,118
What ever are we going to do?

590
00:49:06,625 --> 00:49:11,961
Ohh! I don't see why she
has to marry any old prince.

591
00:49:12,031 --> 00:49:15,296
Now, that's not for us
to decide, dear.

592
00:49:26,779 --> 00:49:30,408
Maybe we should tell King Stefan
about the boy.

593
00:49:30,482 --> 00:49:33,383
- Well, why don't we?
- Listen!

594
00:49:33,452 --> 00:49:35,716
Maleficent! Rose!

595
00:49:35,788 --> 00:49:37,756
- Rose!
- Rose!

596
00:49:37,823 --> 00:49:40,917
-Oh, why did we leave her alone?
-No! No!
-Rose!

597
00:49:40,993 --> 00:49:42,927
Rose!

598
00:50:02,514 --> 00:50:05,711
- Here.
- Rose!
- Rose!

599
00:50:05,784 --> 00:50:07,945
- Rose! Rose, where are you?
- Rose!
- Rose!

600
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,614
Where are you?

601
00:50:15,327 --> 00:50:19,263
Rose! Rose! Rose!

602
00:50:31,443 --> 00:50:34,310
- Rose! Rose!
- Rose!

603
00:50:45,557 --> 00:50:46,581
- Rose!
- Rose!
- Rose!

604
00:50:57,703 --> 00:51:01,400
- Rose!
- Rose!
- Don't touch anything!

605
00:51:01,473 --> 00:51:03,498
Anything! Anything!

606
00:51:03,575 --> 00:51:07,511
Touch the spindle.
Touch it, I say.

607
00:51:12,751 --> 00:51:16,278
You poor, simple fools,

608
00:51:16,355 --> 00:51:18,186
thinking you could defeat me.

609
00:51:18,257 --> 00:51:21,693
Me, the mistress of all evil!

610
00:51:23,095 --> 00:51:26,997
Well, here's your
precious princess.

611
00:51:33,238 --> 00:51:36,696
- Rose!
- Oh, Rose!

612
00:51:36,775 --> 00:51:41,803
Oh, I'll never
forgive myself.

613
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,713
We're all to blame.

614
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:57,226
Stefan, th-there's-- there's something
important I have to tell you.

615
00:51:57,296 --> 00:51:59,287
Uh, not now, Hubert.

616
00:51:59,364 --> 00:52:01,457
But-- But it's a-about Phillip.

617
00:52:01,533 --> 00:52:04,696
Phillip? Oh, yes,
of course, Phillip.

618
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:08,706
- Why, where is the boy?
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

619
00:52:08,906 --> 00:52:10,806
-Well, send for him immediately.
-But--

620
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:12,968
Shh!

621
00:52:14,812 --> 00:52:17,007
The sun has set.

622
00:52:17,081 --> 00:52:20,414
Make ready to welcome
your princess.

623
00:53:21,546 --> 00:53:24,982
Poor King Stefan and the Queen.

624
00:53:25,049 --> 00:53:27,950
They'll be heartbroken
when they find out.

625
00:53:30,621 --> 00:53:33,613
- They're not going to.
- They aren't?

626
00:53:33,691 --> 00:53:37,821
- But--
- We'll put them all to sleep
until Rose awakens.

627
00:53:45,369 --> 00:53:47,564
Come.

628
00:53:55,145 --> 00:54:01,448
Sleeping Beauty fair

629
00:54:02,586 --> 00:54:06,613
Gold of sunshine

630
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:10,683
In your hair

631
00:54:11,762 --> 00:54:14,822
Lips that shame

632
00:54:14,898 --> 00:54:18,698
The red, red rose

633
00:54:20,437 --> 00:54:23,600
Dreaming of true love

634
00:54:23,674 --> 00:54:29,613
In slumber repose

635
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,810
One day

636
00:54:33,884 --> 00:54:37,877
He will come

637
00:54:37,955 --> 00:54:46,659
Riding out of the dawn

638
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:49,722
And you'll awaken

639
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:54,737
To love's first kiss

640
00:54:54,805 --> 00:54:57,205
'Til then

641
00:54:57,274 --> 00:54:59,799
Sleeping Beauty

642
00:54:59,876 --> 00:55:04,006
Sleep on

643
00:55:04,915 --> 00:55:09,147
One day you'll awaken

644
00:55:09,219 --> 00:55:12,848
To love's first kiss

645
00:55:14,324 --> 00:55:17,418
'Til then

646
00:55:17,494 --> 00:55:22,227
Sleeping Beauty

647
00:55:22,299 --> 00:55:27,931
Sleep on

648
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,242
Well,just been talking
to Phillip.

649
00:55:39,316 --> 00:55:44,049
Seems he's fallen in love
with some-- peasant girl.

650
00:55:44,121 --> 00:55:46,681
Peasant girl?

651
00:55:46,757 --> 00:55:50,022
Yes? Yes?

652
00:55:50,093 --> 00:55:53,028
The peasant girl? Who is she?
Where did he meet her?

653
00:55:53,096 --> 00:55:56,896
Uh,just some
peasant girl he met--

654
00:55:56,967 --> 00:55:58,901
Where? Where?

655
00:55:58,969 --> 00:56:02,962
Once upon a dream.

656
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:07,067
Once upon a dre--
Rose! Prince Phillip!

657
00:56:07,144 --> 00:56:09,806
Oh! Oh!

658
00:56:13,116 --> 00:56:15,949
Come on. We've got to
get back to the cottage.

659
00:57:03,433 --> 00:57:05,594
Come in.

660
00:57:35,031 --> 00:57:37,295
Well!

661
00:57:37,366 --> 00:57:40,802
This is a pleasant surprise.

662
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:44,567
I set my trap for a peasant,
and lo,

663
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,801
I catch a prince.

664
00:57:49,946 --> 00:57:52,039
Away with him.

665
00:57:52,115 --> 00:57:55,312
But gently, my pets.
Gently.

666
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,687
I have plans
for our royal guest.

667
00:58:33,923 --> 00:58:35,390
- Maleficent!
- Maleficent!
- Maleficent!

668
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:38,188
She's got Prince Phillip!

669
00:58:38,261 --> 00:58:41,196
At the Forbidden Mountain.

670
00:58:41,264 --> 00:58:43,755
But we can't--
we can't go there.

671
00:58:44,834 --> 00:58:47,769
We can, and we must!

672
01:01:08,911 --> 01:01:12,005
What a pity Prince Phillip
can't be here...

673
01:01:12,081 --> 01:01:14,879
to enjoy the celebration.

674
01:01:16,919 --> 01:01:20,855
Come. We must go to the dungeon
and cheer him up.

675
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:17,761
Oh, come now, Prince Phillip.

676
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:20,603
Why so melancholy?

677
01:02:20,676 --> 01:02:23,975
A wondrous future
lies before you.

678
01:02:24,046 --> 01:02:26,947
You, the destined hero...

679
01:02:27,015 --> 01:02:30,280
of a charming fairy tale
come true.

680
01:02:34,856 --> 01:02:38,815
Behold, King Stefan's castle.

681
01:02:38,894 --> 01:02:41,522
And in yonder topmost tower,

682
01:02:41,597 --> 01:02:44,293
dreaming of her true love,

683
01:02:44,366 --> 01:02:47,301
the Princess Aurora.

684
01:02:48,604 --> 01:02:51,801
But see the gracious
whim of fate.

685
01:02:51,873 --> 01:02:55,206
Why, 'tis the selfsame
peasant maid...

686
01:02:55,277 --> 01:02:59,213
who won the heart of
our noble prince but yesterday.

687
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:06,414
She is indeed
most wondrous fair,

688
01:03:07,656 --> 01:03:10,489
gold of sunshine
in her hair,

689
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:14,996
lips that shame
the red, red rose.

690
01:03:15,063 --> 01:03:19,329
In ageless sleep,
she finds repose.

691
01:03:21,637 --> 01:03:24,197
The years roll by.

692
01:03:24,272 --> 01:03:29,335
But a hundred years to
a steadfast heart are but a day.

693
01:03:29,411 --> 01:03:33,211
And now, the gates
of a dungeon part,

694
01:03:33,281 --> 01:03:37,911
and our prince
is free to go his way.

695
01:03:37,986 --> 01:03:42,013
Off he rides
on his noble steed--

696
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:46,424
a valiant figure,
straight and tall--

697
01:03:46,495 --> 01:03:48,725
to wake his love...

698
01:03:48,797 --> 01:03:52,233
with love's first kiss...

699
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:57,533
and prove that true love
conquers all!

700
01:04:00,942 --> 01:04:03,706
Why, you, you, y--

701
01:04:07,115 --> 01:04:10,881
Come, my pet. Let us leave
our noble prince...

702
01:04:10,952 --> 01:04:14,388
with these happy thoughts.

703
01:04:17,959 --> 01:04:21,156
A most gratifying day.

704
01:04:25,901 --> 01:04:29,098
For the first time
in sixteen years,

705
01:04:29,171 --> 01:04:32,334
I shall sleep well.

706
01:04:47,989 --> 01:04:50,583
Shh! No time to explain.

707
01:04:59,501 --> 01:05:02,265
Wait, Prince Phillip.
The road to true love...

708
01:05:02,337 --> 01:05:05,363
may be barred by still
many more dangers...

709
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,670
which you alone
will have to face.

710
01:05:07,743 --> 01:05:12,612
So arm thyself with this
enchanted shield of virtue...

711
01:05:12,681 --> 01:05:15,946
and this mighty
sword of truth,

712
01:05:16,017 --> 01:05:20,283
for these weapons of righteousness
will triumph over evil.

713
01:05:20,355 --> 01:05:23,017
Now, come. We must hurry.

714
01:06:10,071 --> 01:06:12,198
Phillip, watch out!

715
01:07:08,663 --> 01:07:12,895
Silence! You, tell
those fools to--

716
01:07:12,967 --> 01:07:16,403
No! No!

717
01:07:19,874 --> 01:07:23,071
Watch out, Phillip!

718
01:07:29,818 --> 01:07:33,083
Hurry! Hurry, Phillip!

719
01:07:44,566 --> 01:07:48,434
A forest of thorns
shall be his tomb,

720
01:07:48,503 --> 01:07:51,961
borne through the skies
on a fog of doom!

721
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:55,532
Now go with a curse
and serve me well.

722
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:59,444
'Round Stefan's castle
cast my spell.

723
01:08:50,231 --> 01:08:52,927
No! It cannot be!

724
01:08:58,739 --> 01:09:02,698
Now shall you deal
with me, O Prince,

725
01:09:02,777 --> 01:09:05,507
and all the powers of hell!

726
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:53,385
Up! Up this way!

727
01:10:09,143 --> 01:10:11,907
Now, sword of truth,
fly swift and sure...

728
01:10:11,979 --> 01:10:15,471
that evil die
and good endure!

729
01:11:57,751 --> 01:11:59,844
Ehhh-- Oh, oh, uh--

730
01:11:59,919 --> 01:12:04,015
Forgive me, Hubert.
Ehh, uh, the wine. Now, uh--

731
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:06,058
You, uh, were saying?

732
01:12:06,126 --> 01:12:10,062
Huh? I-I was?
Oh! Oh, yes.

733
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:14,897
Well, after all, Stefan,
this is the fourteenth century.

734
01:12:14,968 --> 01:12:18,233
Yes. You, uh, you said that
a moment ago.

735
01:12:18,305 --> 01:12:21,365
Well, to come
right to the point,

736
01:12:21,441 --> 01:12:24,239
my son Phillip says
he's going to marry--

737
01:12:49,902 --> 01:12:52,735
It's Aurora! She's here!

738
01:12:57,142 --> 01:12:59,940
A-And-And-And Phillip!

739
01:13:13,993 --> 01:13:16,928
Wh-- What does this mean, boy?

740
01:13:16,996 --> 01:13:19,760
I-I don't under--

741
01:13:22,534 --> 01:13:25,367
B-Bu-- But-But, uh--

742
01:13:31,343 --> 01:13:33,937
I-I don't understand.

743
01:13:58,304 --> 01:14:01,398
Why, Fauna,
what's the matter, dear?

744
01:14:01,473 --> 01:14:05,307
Oh, I just love
happy endings.

745
01:14:05,377 --> 01:14:09,245
Yes, I do too-- t--

746
01:14:09,315 --> 01:14:11,579
Blue!

747
01:14:14,887 --> 01:14:18,846
- Pink.
- I know you

748
01:14:18,924 --> 01:14:24,226
- I walked with you once upon a dream
- Blue.

749
01:14:24,296 --> 01:14:26,856
I know you

750
01:14:26,932 --> 01:14:28,900
The gleam in your eyes

751
01:14:28,968 --> 01:14:32,233
Is so familiar a gleam

752
01:14:32,304 --> 01:14:35,273
Yet I know it's true

753
01:14:35,341 --> 01:14:40,176
That visions are seldom
all they seem

754
01:14:40,245 --> 01:14:42,611
But if I know you

755
01:14:42,681 --> 01:14:44,842
I know what you'll do

756
01:14:44,917 --> 01:14:46,908
You'll love me at once

757
01:14:46,986 --> 01:14:49,079
The way you did once

758
01:14:49,154 --> 01:14:51,714
Upon

759
01:14:51,790 --> 01:15:00,289
A dream
