1
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,100
- Hey.
- Hi.

2
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,400
- Your autograph, please.
- Sure.

3
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,900
Thank you.

4
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,300
Thanks for this.

5
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,600
Good. That's it.

6
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,900
Good.

7
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,300
I'm pushing the air in now,
just a little.

8
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,900
So... the pressure in the chest
will change.

9
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,900
You're doing a great job.

10
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,900
Do you need a ride, Lucy?

11
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,800
No, thanks.

12
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,500
Think I might do the dry cleaners'.

13
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,700
- Take care.
- I am right here.

14
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
See you.

15
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,700
See you.

16
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,200
Can I interest you in a line?

17
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,200
Yeah, why not?

18
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,600
Thanks.

19
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,200
My pleasure.

20
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,700
- This is Lucy.
- Hi.

21
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,100
Hi, Lucy.

22
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,800
Lucy in the sky.

23
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,400
We were just talking about which
one of us is gonna fuck you.

24
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,500
Really?

25
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,100
Why don't you toss for it then?

26
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,500
You in?

27
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,900
Heads or tails?

28
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,500
Head.

29
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,100
Cunt.

30
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,000
Head it is.

31
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,300
Yes, my prince.
Did I say when?

32
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,700
Did I say tonight?

33
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
This year, next year.

34
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,700
Fair enough.
We'll toss.

35
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,100
Tonight or next year.

36
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,000
Tonight...

37
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,000
...head.

38
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
- Tonight.
- It's my lucky night.

39
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,000
Now, or in 5 hours?

40
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,600
OK, now.

41
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,600
Tails.

42
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,700
Tails never fails.

43
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,300
Let's go then, shall we?

44
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,700
Bye.

45
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,400
- Morning.
- Morning.

46
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,100
Have you got the rent?

47
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,600
The rent?

48
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,800
The rent.

49
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,700
As in the rent. The rent
is due, the rent is overdue.

50
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Here's some. Won't kill them to wait.

51
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,300
You have no idea, do you?
It's her house.

52
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,700
Is it your house?

53
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,600
It's her parent's house. It's no
virtue on being born.

54
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,800
Just pay the fucking rent

55
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,600
And while you're at it,
clean the fucking bathroom.

56
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,400
As we all agreed, it's your turn.

57
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,700
- I did clean the bathroom.
- You have to grout.

58
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Grout.

59
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
In between the tiles,
the black stuff.

60
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It will give me
great pleasure to grout.

61
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,400
Lucy.

62
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,400
Telephone.
It's your mother.

63
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,600
- Line 3.
- Thank you.

64
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,600
Hi, mom.

65
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,400
How did you get this number?

66
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,900
No.

67
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,500
Do you want me to lose this job?

68
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,500
OK, yes. I've got it in my hand.

69
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,500
It's VISA.

70
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,000
5464...

71
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,800
6870...

72
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,400
1390.

73
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,600
The expiry is 04/15.

74
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,200
Sorry?

75
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,400
Yeah, I can see it.
It's 399.

76
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
I have to go now, mom.

77
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,000
I have to go.
OK, bye.

78
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,000
- Hello, Lucy.
- Hello, Birdmann.

79
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,700
- Come in.
- I bare gifts.

80
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,400
Thanks.

81
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,500
- So, how are you?
- I'm very well, thank you. And you?

82
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,600
Oh yes, very well. Thank you.

83
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,100
- How's the family?
- Very well, thank you. And yours?

84
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,300
- Oh yes, very well.
- And how are the kids?

85
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,100
Yes, they're fantastic.

86
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,100
That's great.

87
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,200
It's good to see you.

88
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,100
You look beautiful.

89
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,000
Thank you.

90
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,100
I have something important to tell you.

91
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,000
Do you remember that time...
on the beach.

92
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,400
After we'd been to Andy's place,
that moment.

93
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,500
I wanted to kiss you.

94
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
You must have wanted me to kiss you.

95
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,300
I couldn't because of my tongue.

96
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,600
My tongue was furred.

97
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,800
Furred and thick.

98
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,800
Putrid.

99
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,000
The asshole, of the asshole,
of the asshole.

100
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,800
I couldn't kiss you.

101
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,000
That's OK.

102
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,400
I wanted you to know.

103
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,100
I just want to love my friends.

104
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,600
I know.

105
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,600
It's not an unreasonable request.

106
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,400
I'm so fucking tired...

107
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
of watching Oprah.

108
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,800
Hi. I'm Melissa. I'm calling about the ad
in the student paper.

109
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,900
Slim.

110
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,500
Pert.

111
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,800
What should I wear?

112
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,600
OK great. I look forward to seeing you.

113
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,200
Goodbye.

114
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Are you sure you don't want
a cup of tea or coffee?

115
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,200
- Water?
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.

116
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,100
Yes, I think we're ready.

117
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,300
Yes.

118
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,900
- Hello.
- Hi.

119
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,900
Please, come in.

120
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,900
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

121
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,600
Thank you for coming.

122
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,700
Such a pleasure to see
such a unique beauty.

123
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,100
Let me tell you how things
should proceed.

124
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,000
I'll describe the job and then
if you're interested...

125
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,300
we'll discuss particulars,
how does that sound?

126
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,600
Yes. Good.

127
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,600
We're looking for Silver service waitress
to work at private functions...

128
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,700
in lingerie that we will supply.

129
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,700
You will be working with
other girls...

130
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,700
...some of whom will have
more responsibilities.

131
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,900
There is room for promotion.

132
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,200
The pay is $250/hour cash.

133
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,100
You'll be engaged on a freelance basis.

134
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,800
Job by job.

135
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,700
Either one of us can terminate our
arrangement at any time...

136
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,100
so please be sure to maintain another
more reliable source of income.

137
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,700
I understand.

138
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,000
We rely on mutual trust.
And discretion.

139
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,000
And I'm obliged to tell you they're
heavy penalties...

140
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,600
...very heavy penalties
for any breaches of discretion.

141
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,900
- Am I clear?
- Yes.

142
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,600
My sincere advice to you is to
use the money wisely.

143
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,000
Think of it as a windfall,
pay off a student loan.

144
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,300
Please, please do not think
of this as a career.

145
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,300
Just work hard for a short
amount of time.

146
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,300
Your vagina will not be penetrated.

147
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,200
- Your vagina will be a temple.
- My vagina...

148
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,500
...is not a temple.

149
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,400
While that's quite true my darling,
you won?t ever be penetrated.

150
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,500
Now. Will you stand up
for me please and strip.

151
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,100
Thomas?

152
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,300
Open your mouth, darling.

153
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,300
Not pierced?

154
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,600
Do you have any tattoos?

155
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,800
Good.

156
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,000
Stand your feet apart a few inches.

157
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,400
What's this?

158
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,400
I had a mole removed.

159
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,600
Please, get dressed.

160
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,100
I have some questions that
I need to ask you.

161
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,200
Are you on any medication?

162
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,300
Just the pill.

163
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,000
Anything else?

164
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,100
- No allergies? Antidepressants?
- No.

165
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,800
- Prozac? Effexor?
- No.

166
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,400
Are you a smoker?

167
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
No.

168
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,900
Maybe the occasional...

169
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,700
...jazz cigarette.
Very rarely.

170
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,600
Other drugs? Anything at all toxic?

171
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,500
No, never.

172
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,400
Why not?

173
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,500
Throughout history humankind has used drugs.
Drugs are a form of...

174
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,100
...grace.

175
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,900
Aspirin for the soul.

176
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,500
My mother is an alcoholic
with a violent temper.

177
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,500
She runs an astrology hotline.

178
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,200
We have a doctor that we'd
like you to see. For blood tests.

179
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,600
- Will that be a problem?
- No, that's fine.

180
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,800
You called us on a public telephone.
You have mobile?

181
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,100
- Yes.
- Good.

182
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,900
We'll cover all your expenses,
all your work-related expenses.

183
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,300
Now.

184
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,000
Silver service.

185
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,500
- Are you familiar with Silver service?
- Yes.

186
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,100
From what side does one serve the fish?

187
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,200
- Right side.
- Left side.

188
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
Thomas, take note.
Thomas is going to help you.

189
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,700
You are very beautiful.
Very talented.

190
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,300
But we're going to make you
even more beautiful.

191
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,400
Even more talented.
Come.

192
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,900
And your name...

193
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,800
We'd like to call you Sara.

194
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,500
OK. Thank you.

195
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,900
Fuck!

196
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,500
- You all right, darling?
- Yeah.

197
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,700
- Would you like a lavender tissue?
- Sure.

198
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,900
Fuck.

200
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,200
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

201
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,900
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you. And how are you?

202
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,700
Oh yes, fine. Thank you.

203
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,900
OK sit down at the table.

204
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
To what do I owe this
extraordinary pleasure?

205
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,900
Nothing special.

206
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,600
Just upgrading my skill set.

207
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,900
Nothing special?

208
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,900
White or white?

209
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,000
Can we watch some porn?

210
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,400
No.

211
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,900
What have you done
to your fingers?

212
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,500
Sara?

213
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,500
Hi, Sara.
I'm Sophie.

214
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,000
- You look lovely.
- Thanks.

215
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,100
OK. Now, I need you to go into the
dressing room for me and fix your make up.

216
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,600
You'll find a lipstick palette in there
and I want you to match...

217
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,000
...an exact match...

218
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,000
...match your lipstick to the
color of your labia.

219
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,600
You're kidding me.

220
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,400
It's not a game.

221
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,700
You're OK? Good.

222
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,900
Ready?

223
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,700
Let's go.

224
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,500
Thank you friends for coming
here tonight.

225
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,100
As ever, it is wonderful to see you.

226
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,400
Thank you.

227
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,600
This evening we're serving
Beluga caviar with toasted brioche.

228
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,400
Service.

229
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,300
Galantine of quail
stuffed with black truffle...

230
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,600
on the nest of fried leek
and herbs.

231
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,000
Curious choice.

232
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,100
I first tried that dish
many years ago.

233
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,600
On the occasion of my 20th
wedding anniversary.

234
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,800
But tonight, I've asked my chef
to do what he can...

235
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,000
...to bring it back to life.

236
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,500
Perhaps you'll be able to tell me
whether it really does taste so good.

237
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,300
Or if it is the memories of Elizabeth
and that night that make it so special.

238
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,200
To the dish itself.

239
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,800
To the dish.

240
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,000
To memories.

241
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,000
- Brandy?
- Thank you.

242
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,100
Such fair skin.

243
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,800
Brandy?

244
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,200
Thank you.

245
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,500
Not to worry.

246
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,400
Upsy daisy.

247
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,100
No harm done.

248
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,800
Sorry.

249
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,300
Don't worry.
You did really well.

250
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,200
Leave those for the cleaners.

251
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,100
We won't be needing you
anymore tonight.

252
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,400
Thanks.

253
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,000
- You look lovely.
- Yeah, you too.

254
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,100
Your hair looks great.

255
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,200
Can I leave early tonight?

256
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,900
- Just this once.
- Thank you.

257
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
It gets a bit easier.

258
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,900
It's never easy, though.

259
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,900
How long have you been
doing it for?

260
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,300
What kind of a question
is that?

261
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,900
I'm sorry.

262
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,600
- Thanks.
- No problem.

263
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,700
May I?

264
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,200
Yeah, be my guest.

265
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,400
Some people fake their deaths.
I'm faking my life.

266
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,600
You're doing a good job.

267
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,100
I want to show you something.

268
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,000
I would really love to
suck your cock.

269
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,100
Hallelujah.

270
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,200
Hi, Lucy.

271
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,900
What time is it?

272
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,200
It's morning.

273
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,600
Can I get you anything?

274
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,500
Coffee?

275
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,200
Yeah, coffee.
Thanks.

276
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,900
Hey, Birdmann?

277
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,400
Will you marry me?

278
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,500
Yes.

279
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,500
Thank you.

280
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,400
- Not at all.
- It's very kind of you.

281
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,200
It's a pleasure.

282
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,900
Thanks.

283
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,200
I'm ready, I think.

284
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,800
I think I'm nearly ready

285
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,600
We can get you back
into detox.

286
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,700
I could, I'm flush.

287
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,000
Thank you.

288
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,200
I don't think I'd make it
this time.

289
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,600
You could.

290
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,200
Do you believe that?

291
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,200
I don't know.

292
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,500
Sandhill Dunnart.

293
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,700
Nocturnal and endangered.

294
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,400
A marsupial mouse.

295
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,400
Thought to be extinct
until recently.

296
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,500
Its main predators include
owls and bats.

297
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,100
Little is known about the animal
due to its rarity.

298
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,900
First they eat insects but
will also eat meat on occasion.

299
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,800
Sharp, carnivore's teeth.

300
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,000
Scared, Sandhill Dunnart will make
a loud noise...

301
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,800
...as it moves into an
offensive position.

302
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,500
What it really is...

303
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,800
...the Sandhill Dunnart...

304
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
is a miniature, a more
tenacious kangaroo.

305
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,400
Hi, Thomas.
No time, no hear.

306
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,700
I'd be happy to do what I can,
try me.

307
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,800
Sorry?

308
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,500
For how long?

309
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,900
That's it?

310
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,000
How much?

311
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,900
OK yes.
Yeah, I understand.

312
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,600
OK. Bye.

313
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,600
- Hey.
- Good afternoon.

314
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,700
Come in.
Come through.

315
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,700
Welcome to my home.

316
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,100
I hope the trip wasn't too grueling.

317
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,700
- No, it was fine. Thank you.
- Wonderful.

318
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,400
Perhaps you'd like a shower
to refresh you after your long drive.

319
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,500
There's a bathroom at the end
of the corridor on the right.

320
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,500
You'll find a robe behind the door.

321
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,400
Oh, and try not to let your
hair get wet.

322
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,900
Sure.

323
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,400
I'm ready.

324
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,600
- Are you feeling well?
- Pardon?

325
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,900
Are you in good health?

326
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,200
Yeah, I'm fine.

327
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,600
You're going to sleep
and wake up.

328
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,100
It'd be as if these hours
never existed.

329
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,600
You won't even dream.

330
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,600
For an hour or two after you wake
you'll feel, yes, slightly...

331
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,900
...groggy, but then fine.

332
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,400
Perfectly fine.

333
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,700
Not nearly as bad as a hangover.

334
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,600
Such a sleep works wonders.

335
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,800
You'll feel...

336
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,000
...profoundly groggy.

337
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,600
Thank you, Clara.

338
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,600
A few months ago,
a strange thing happened.

339
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,300
I was idling through my bookshelves,
when I noticed a book...

340
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,400
...my brother's once given me
for my birthday.

341
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,500
A collection of short stories.

342
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,400
Well, I started to reread
one of those stories.

343
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:36,000
It was about a man who one morning
wakes up and cannot...

344
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,300
bring himself to get out of bed.

345
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,200
He shuts his eyes is self defense.

346
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,600
He reexamines his life.
He's seized with a restlessness.

347
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,800
He packs his bags, cuts all ties,

348
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,000
he can no longer live
among the people he knows.

349
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,300
They paralyze him.

350
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,500
He's monied, he goes to Rome.

351
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,300
He wants to burrow under the earth
like a bulb, like a root.

352
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,200
But even in Rome he cannot escape
people from his former life.

353
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,100
So, he decides to return to the city
where he was born and educated...

354
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:17,500
but which he can't quite
bring himself to call home.

355
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,200
Well, the move doesn't help.

356
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,900
He feels he has no more right
to return than a dead man.

357
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:32,100
What can he do? He desires an extreme
solution to his conundrum.

358
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,900
He aches for nothing less than
a new world, a new language.

359
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,800
Nothing changes.

360
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,600
Out of indifference, and because he
can't think of anything better to do...

361
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,300
...he decides once more to
leave his hometown, to do some hitching.

362
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,600
A man picks him up,
they ride off into the night...

363
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,600
when "bang",
the car smacks into a wall.

364
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,900
The driver dies,
our man is hospitalized, broken up.

365
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:06,000
Months pass, his wounds heal.

366
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,400
Now he wishes for life.

367
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:15,500
He has a confidence in himself,
in things he doesn't have to explain.

368
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:21,000
Things like the pores in his skin,
all things corporeal.

369
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:26,200
He can't wait to get out of the hospital,
away from the infirm and the moribund.

370
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:33,200
"I say unto thee, rise up and walk.
None of your bones are broken".

371
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,500
The end.

372
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,600
When I reread those words...

373
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,500
"Rise up and walk.
None of your bones are broken"...

374
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,100
I felt a tremendous sadness.

375
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,200
Do you know what the opening
line of the story is?

376
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:57,600
"When a man enters his 30th year
people will not stop calling him young".

377
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,600
30.

378
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,800
I'd been given the book
for my thirtieth birthday.

379
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,400
"The Thirtieth Year"
by Ingeborg Bachmann.

380
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,300
So I had heard.

381
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,100
I had been told.

382
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,900
I knew all along, even if
I didn't really know.

383
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:24,500
The great true things are unsurprising.

384
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,600
But what did I do back then?

385
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:33,600
I carried on.

386
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,200
I carried on dutifully.

387
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,100
We were the happy couple, Elizabeth and I.
That's how people saw us.

388
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,800
But in truth, I did not cherish my wife.

389
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,900
And I did not cherish my friends.

390
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,800
Or even my children.

391
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:03,700
I just carried on.

392
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,600
I was a success.

393
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,100
I made my way.

394
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:15,900
But with each step I cringed.
I was on the back foot, the defensive.

395
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,200
And now...

396
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:27,000
...tonight, for the first time
I say...

397
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,500
...my bones are broken.

398
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,000
Broken.

399
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,900
One day I will need your help.

400
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:48,700
All of my bones are broken.

401
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,200
You're safe.

402
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,100
There's no shame here.
No one can see you.

403
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,600
But our rules must be respected.
No penetration.

404
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,200
Thank you, Clara.

405
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,100
Take care.

406
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,400
You will feel better very soon.

407
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,800
Thanks.

408
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,500
Your instinct was right.

409
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,400
We'll see.

410
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,800
You really are a fuckwit.

411
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,100
2 weeks and you're out.

412
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,700
Adios amigo.

413
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,900
Chinga tu madre.
(Fuck your mother)

414
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,200
I'm really sorry.

415
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,100
Me too.

416
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:21,800
Good morning.

417
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,200
Is this Excelon still available?

418
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:45,300
That's right. Fantastic place.
Out of the city.

419
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,800
I have keys, I can show you
if you like.

420
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,300
No, it's fine.

421
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,600
I'm sure the Excelon
will be excellent.

422
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,700
- It is better to see it, though.
- No, it's OK.

423
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,200
I have a friend in the building.

424
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,600
Well, if that's the case,
then we can definitely do that.

425
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,900
Do you have photo ID?

426
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,300
Some paperwork.
You know how it is.

427
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,100
A stitch in time saves nine.

428
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,600
Hi, Thomas.
This is Sara.

429
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,100
I was just wondering if
Clara is out of her meeting.

430
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,700
Maybe you could give me a hand.

431
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,500
Thing is, I have a new lease.

432
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,600
I was just wondering if there's
any work available.

433
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,200
I'd be really grateful if you
could keep me in mind.

434
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,600
Thanks very much.
Bye, Thomas.

435
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,900
Nearly done.

436
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,100
It's OK.

437
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,000
Here it comes,
it's all right.

438
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,400
Sorry.

439
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,000
I have an important call,
I really have to take it.

440
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,600
I'll be back, Dr. Frankenstein.

441
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,800
OK. Bad monster.

442
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,600
Look.

443
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,400
It's my bag. I'm coming back, OK?

444
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,700
We have one rule.
No penetration.

445
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:14,900
Only way I can get a hard on these days
is if I swallow a truck load of Viagra...

446
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:18,900
...and then some beautiful woman
jams her fingers up my ass.

447
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:26,500
I'm the one that needs
the penetration.

448
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:28,700
I don't expect that
good fortune tonight.

449
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,900
You're quite right.

450
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,200
Thanks, Clara.

451
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:26,000
Stretch your cunt, you little bitch.

452
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:46,800
I'm gonna press your button
and make you all wet.

453
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:51,300
Then I'm gonna fuck you
with my big dick.

454
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:59,800
I'm gonna fuck you with my
horse's prick and make you fucking scream.

455
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:24,000
You fucking little bitch.

456
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,500
You fucking little whore.

457
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,000
You fucking little bitch.

458
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:14,900
Hi.

459
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,700
OK, I'm coming.

460
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,400
Excuse me.

461
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,600
It's OK, I'm here.

462
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,200
Hello, Lucy.

463
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:15,000
Take your top off.

464
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:38,400
I love drinking.
I'm really good at it.

465
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,600
When did you last see him?

466
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,300
About 3 or 4 months ago.
Took him out to dinner.

467
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,700
He was wearing your old suit,
I think. The gray one.

468
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,300
I haven't seen the Birdmann in...

469
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:00,100
Well, when was the last time
I saw you?

470
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,200
A year?

471
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,100
They say it was 2 weeks before
his brother found him.

472
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,200
2 weeks in this weather.

473
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:18,100
Will you marry me?

474
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,400
What?

475
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:24,900
Why?

476
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:27,600
I mean...

477
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,900
Why now?

478
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,500
You had your chance.

479
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,900
Go on.

480
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:40,400
Fuck you.

481
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:44,400
Fuck you to death.

482
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,200
That's one way to put it.

483
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,400
I'm with Helen now.

484
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,100
I can't believe you.

485
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,800
I don't believe you.

486
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,100
You don't believe you.

487
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,700
Fuck it.

488
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,900
Helen is courteous.

489
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,600
You should try it sometime.

490
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:24,500
Courtesy.

491
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:28,800
Courtesy.

492
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,700
You'll be safe here.

493
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,000
There's no shame.
No one can see you.

494
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,300
Thank you, Clara.

495
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,400
I do ask that there?ll
be no penetration.

496
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:00,100
I also ask that you take care
not to leave any marks.

497
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,800
Thank you.

498
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:10,300
We do fire people here, you know?

499
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:14,700
Well?

500
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:19,300
All right, you're fired.

501
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:23,200
Thank you.

502
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,400
Excuse me?

503
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,000
Hello, excuse me?

504
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,900
Hi. Can I get some help?

505
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,500
What do you think of this one?

506
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,800
Yeah, not bad.

507
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,300
OK, I'll take it then.

508
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,100
Cool. Up here.

509
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,100
OK. Let's get going.

510
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:25,500
We pick up with black 129,
making a bold move to attack his triangle.

511
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:29,000
It's an impressive move,
unexpected.

512
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:33,200
And then, what does the
master do?

513
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:37,400
He counter attacks, with white
130 to the right.

514
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:41,300
White 130?
Why did he do that?

515
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,900
After 27 long minutes of deliberation...

516
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:49,800
why did the master play a move,
that would result in his own defeat?

517
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:15,300
Are you gonna come to the party?

518
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,600
I can't. Have a big day tomorrow.

519
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,900
- How big?
- I'm sleeping.

520
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,300
What?
Live a little. Just a little.

521
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:27,100
- What is it?
- I don't know.

522
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:31,800
But it's something good for you.

523
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,700
Why not?

524
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,900
There you go.
Back from the dead.

525
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:44,700
Fear of death is the number 1 hoax.

526
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,400
Lucy, turn it off.

527
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:04,900
Hello?

528
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,300
Yeah. In 2 minutes. OK.

529
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:18,300
You need to get some blinds.
Fucking hell.

530
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,500
Lucy.

531
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:59,100
Come back inside.

532
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:02,900
- You're sure?
- She's fine.

533
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,100
Can you pull over?

534
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:49,700
Pull over!

535
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:39,800
- Hello, darling.
- Hi.

536
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,300
- Are you well?
- Fine, thank you.

537
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:49,300
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

538
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,500
A shower always works wonders.

539
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,200
I'd like to ask a favor.

540
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:37,300
I need to see what goes on in there.
Just once.

541
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:44,000
I understand. Believe me, I do.

542
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:47,200
But my clients...

543
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:53,200
How can I expose them,
to be frank, to blackmail?

544
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:55,400
Just once.

545
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:58,200
That's not the way that
we do things.

546
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:02,200
- Please, Clara.
- I'm sorry.

547
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:16,900
And I can assume you're quite well?

548
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:20,500
Perfectly fine, thank you.

549
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:23,600
And you're in good health?

550
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,100
Yes.

551
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:35,300
Good girl.

552
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:50,600
Thank you, Clara.

553
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:36,000
Are you sure?

554
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,000
Thank you.

555
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:19,600
Goodnight.

556
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,800
Goodnight.

557
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:22,800
