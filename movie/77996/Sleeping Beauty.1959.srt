1
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,417
I know you

2
00:00:31,494 --> 00:00:36,596
I walked with you
once upon a dream

3
00:00:36,673 --> 00:00:39,205
I know you

4
00:00:39,282 --> 00:00:44,231
The gleam in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam

5
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:47,107
Yet I know it's true

6
00:00:47,146 --> 00:00:51,749
That visions are seldom
all they seem

7
00:00:51,788 --> 00:00:56,046
But if I know you
I know what you'll do

8
00:00:56,124 --> 00:00:58,080
You'll love me at once

9
00:00:58,157 --> 00:01:05,024
The way you did
once upon a dream

10
00:02:12,814 --> 00:02:15,461
In a faraway land
long ago...

11
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:18,338
lived a king
and his fair queen.

12
00:02:18,415 --> 00:02:21,177
Many years had they
longed for a child,

13
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:23,748
and finally their wish
was granted.

14
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:28,542
A daughter was born,
and they called her Aurora.

15
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,725
Sweet Aurora

16
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:37,674
Yes, they named her
after the dawn,

17
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:41,625
for she filled their lives
with sunshine.

18
00:02:41,702 --> 00:02:45,039
Then a great holiday was proclaimed
throughout the kingdom...

19
00:02:45,117 --> 00:02:47,917
so that all of
high or low estate...

20
00:02:47,956 --> 00:02:51,562
might pay homage
to the infant princess.

21
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,743
And our story begins
on that most joyful day.

22
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:58,697
On thatjoyful day

23
00:02:58,774 --> 00:03:04,375
On thatjoyful day

24
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:09,210
Joyfully now
to our Princess we come

25
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:11,588
Bringing gifts
and all good wishes too

26
00:03:11,665 --> 00:03:13,775
We pledge our loyalty anew

27
00:03:13,852 --> 00:03:17,994
Hail to the Princess Aurora

28
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:21,907
All ofher subjects
adore her

29
00:03:21,986 --> 00:03:26,090
Hail to the King
Hail to the Queen

30
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:30,348
Hail to the Princess Aurora

31
00:03:30,387 --> 00:03:34,338
Health to the Princess
Wealth to the Princess

32
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:38,482
Long live the Princess Aurora

33
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:41,512
Hail Aurora

34
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,655
Hail Aurora

35
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:51,027
Health to the Princess
Wealth to the Princess

36
00:03:51,103 --> 00:03:54,978
Long live the Princess Aurora

37
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:59,122
Hail to the King
Hail to the Queen

38
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:06,180
Hail to the Princess Aurora

39
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,630
Thus, on this great
and joyous day...

40
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:15,081
did all the kingdom celebrate
the long-awaited royal birth.

41
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:19,570
And good King Stefan and his queen
made welcome their lifelong friend.

42
00:04:26,361 --> 00:04:29,621
Their Royal Highnesses,

43
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,189
King Hubert
and Prince Phillip!

44
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:37,064
Fondly had these monarchs
dreamed one day...

45
00:04:37,141 --> 00:04:39,020
their kingdoms to unite.

46
00:04:39,097 --> 00:04:43,202
Thus, today would they announce
that Phillip, Hubert's son and heir,

47
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,118
to Stefan's child
would be betrothed.

48
00:04:48,152 --> 00:04:50,837
And so to her
his gift he brought...

49
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:54,482
and looked unknowing
on his future bride.

50
00:05:07,986 --> 00:05:12,551
Their most honored
and exalted excellencies,

51
00:05:12,628 --> 00:05:14,967
the Three Good Fairies!

52
00:05:17,577 --> 00:05:20,070
Mistress Flora,

53
00:05:20,147 --> 00:05:22,602
Mistress Fauna...

54
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,480
and Mistress Merryweather!

55
00:05:35,032 --> 00:05:38,101
- Oh!
- Oh!
- The little darling.

56
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,242
- Your Majesties.
- Your Majesties.
- Your Majesties.

57
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,117
Each of us the child
may bless with a single gift,

58
00:05:47,195 --> 00:05:49,343
no more, no less.

59
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,289
Little Princess,

60
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:58,165
my gift shall be
the gift of beauty.

61
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:04,687
One gift

62
00:06:04,726 --> 00:06:08,409
Beauty rare

63
00:06:08,487 --> 00:06:11,594
Gold of sunshine

64
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:15,123
In her hair

65
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:22,029
Lips that shame
the red, red rose

66
00:06:22,106 --> 00:06:24,715
She'll walk with springtime

67
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:29,241
Wherever she goes

68
00:06:35,303 --> 00:06:37,681
Tiny Princess,

69
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,750
my gift shall be
the gift of song.

70
00:06:47,388 --> 00:06:49,958
One gift

71
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:53,986
The gift of song

72
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:59,971
Melody her whole life long

73
00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:07,145
The nightingale's
her troubadour

74
00:07:07,222 --> 00:07:15,240
Bringing his sweet serenade
to her door

75
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:24,563
Sweet Princess,
my gift shall be the--

76
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,804
- Why, it's Maleficent.
- What does she want here?
- Shh!

77
00:07:50,881 --> 00:07:55,484
Well, quite a glittering
assemblage, King Stefan.

78
00:07:55,524 --> 00:07:58,593
Royalty, nobility,

79
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,239
the gentry, and--

80
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:05,881
How quaint.
Even the rabble.

81
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,485
I really felt quite distressed
at not receiving an invitation.

82
00:08:10,562 --> 00:08:13,401
- You weren't wanted.
- Not wa--

83
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,657
Oh, dear, what
an awkward situation.

84
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:21,956
I had hoped it was merely due
to some oversight.

85
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:24,564
Well, in that event,
I'd best be on my way.

86
00:08:24,642 --> 00:08:28,056
And you're not offended,
Your Excellency?

87
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:31,740
Why, no, Your Majesty.

88
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,502
And to show
I bear no ill will,

89
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:38,031
I, too, shall bestow
a gift on the child.

90
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,174
Listen well, all of you.

91
00:08:43,862 --> 00:08:49,002
The Princess shall indeed
grow in grace and beauty,

92
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,842
beloved by all who know her.

93
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,870
But...

94
00:08:55,948 --> 00:08:59,477
before the sun sets on
her sixteenth birthday,

95
00:08:59,554 --> 00:09:04,119
she shall prick her finger
on the spindle of a spinning wheel...

96
00:09:04,196 --> 00:09:05,691
and die.

97
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:08,262
Oh, no!

98
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,333
Seize that creature!

99
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,712
Stand back, you fools!

100
00:09:23,877 --> 00:09:26,025
Don't despair, Your Majesties.

101
00:09:26,102 --> 00:09:28,864
Merryweather still
has her gift to give.

102
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:32,087
Then she can undo
this fearful curse?

103
00:09:32,164 --> 00:09:33,736
Oh, no, Sire.

104
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:36,881
Maleficent's powers
are far too great.

105
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,452
But she can help.

106
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:43,327
- But--
-Just do your best, dear.

107
00:09:43,404 --> 00:09:44,708
Yes, go on.

108
00:09:46,243 --> 00:09:48,276
Sweet Princess,

109
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:50,923
if through this
wicked witch's trick...

110
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,378
a spindle should
your finger prick,

111
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:56,524
a ray of hope there
still may be in this,

112
00:09:56,601 --> 00:09:59,401
the gift I give to thee.

113
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:02,049
Not in death,
but just in sleep...

114
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:04,427
the fateful prophecy
you'll keep.

115
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,806
And from this slumber
you shall wake...

116
00:10:06,884 --> 00:10:10,183
when true love's kiss
the spell shall break.

117
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,708
For true love

118
00:10:14,786 --> 00:10:20,387
Conquers all

119
00:10:22,114 --> 00:10:25,988
But King Stefan, still fearful
of his daughter's life,

120
00:10:26,065 --> 00:10:29,863
did then and there decree that every
spinning wheel in the kingdom...

121
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:32,779
should on that very day
be burned.

122
00:10:32,855 --> 00:10:35,157
So 'twas done.

123
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:53,381
Oh, silly fiddle-faddle!

124
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,716
Now, come have
a nice cup of tea, dear.

125
00:10:57,793 --> 00:10:59,941
I'm sure it'll
work out somehow.

126
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,857
Well, a bonfire
won't stop Maleficent.

127
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:05,005
Of course not.
But what will?

128
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:07,882
- Well, perhaps if we reason with her.
- Reason?

129
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,799
- With Maleficent?
- Well, she can't be all bad.

130
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,754
Oh, yes, she can!

131
00:11:12,832 --> 00:11:17,319
Ooh, I'd like to turn her
into a fat, old hoptoad.

132
00:11:17,397 --> 00:11:20,465
Now, dear, that isn't
a very nice thing to say.

133
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:23,919
Besides, we can't. You know
our magic doesn't work that way.

134
00:11:23,996 --> 00:11:27,295
It can only do good, dear,
to bring joy and happiness.

135
00:11:27,372 --> 00:11:29,443
Well, that would
make me happy.

136
00:11:29,597 --> 00:11:31,975
But there must be some way.

137
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:35,312
- There is!
- There is?

138
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:38,343
- What is it, Flora?
- I'm going to--

139
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,872
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!
Even walls have ears.

140
00:11:46,132 --> 00:11:48,779
Follow me.

141
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,623
I'll turn her into a flower.

142
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,076
- Maleficent?
- Oh, no, dear. The Princess.

143
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:10,647
Oh, she'd make
a lovely flower.

144
00:12:10,724 --> 00:12:13,371
Don't you see? A flower
can't prick its finger.

145
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:15,749
- It hasn't any.
- That's right.

146
00:12:15,826 --> 00:12:19,623
- She'll be perfectly safe.
- Until Maleficent sends a frost.

147
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,268
Yes! Eh-- Oh, dear.

148
00:12:23,346 --> 00:12:26,491
She always ruins
your nicest flowers.

149
00:12:26,568 --> 00:12:30,710
You're right. And she'll be
expecting us to do something like that.

150
00:12:30,788 --> 00:12:35,737
Oh! Well, what won't she expect?
She knows everything.

151
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:37,732
Oh, but she doesn't, dear.

152
00:12:37,808 --> 00:12:40,455
Maleficent doesn't know
anything about love...

153
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:45,021
or kindness or the joy
of helping others.

154
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,435
You know, sometimes I don't
think she's really very happy.

155
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:51,198
That's it! Of course.

156
00:12:51,275 --> 00:12:54,727
It's the only thing she can't
understand and won't expect.

157
00:12:56,377 --> 00:12:58,831
Now, now, now, we'll have
to plan it carefully.

158
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:02,707
Let's see. The woodcutter's cottage.
Yes, yes, the abandoned one.

159
00:13:02,746 --> 00:13:05,124
Of course, the King
and Queen will object.

160
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,618
But when we explain
it's the only way--

161
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:10,648
Explain what?

162
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:14,408
About the three peasant women
raising a foundling child...

163
00:13:14,485 --> 00:13:16,594
deep in the forest.

164
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:21,122
- Oh? Oh, that's very nice of them.
- Who are they?

165
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:23,960
Turn around.

166
00:13:24,038 --> 00:13:26,684
- Eww!
- Why, it's us!

167
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:29,524
- Uh-huh.
- You mean, ''we'' us?

168
00:13:29,563 --> 00:13:31,481
- Uh-huh.
- Take care of the baby?

169
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:35,163
- Why not?
- Oh, I'd like that!

170
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,580
Well, y-yes, but w-w-we'd
have to feed it a--

171
00:13:37,658 --> 00:13:40,957
And wash it and dress it
and rock it to sleep.

172
00:13:41,034 --> 00:13:43,911
- Oh, I'd love it.
- Do you really think we can?

173
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:46,059
If humans can do it,
so can we.

174
00:13:46,136 --> 00:13:49,396
- And we'd have our magic to help us.
- That's right.

175
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:52,658
No, no, no, no, no, no!
No magic!

176
00:13:52,696 --> 00:13:54,959
I'll take those wands
right now.

177
00:13:54,998 --> 00:13:57,415
Oh, better get rid
of those wings too.

178
00:13:57,492 --> 00:14:01,443
You mean live like mortals?
For sixteen years?

179
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,087
- Uh-huh.
- B-Bu-- Now, now, we--
we don't know how.

180
00:14:05,165 --> 00:14:07,006
We've never done anything
without magic.

181
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,384
And that's why Maleficent
will never suspect--

182
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:11,302
- But-- But who'll wash?
- And cook?

183
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:14,333
- Oh, we'll all pitch in.
- I'll take care of the baby.

184
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,210
Let me have it, dear.

185
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,086
Come along now. We must tell
their Majesties at once.

186
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,032
- Flora?
- Flora?

187
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:35,971
So the King and his Queen
watched with heavy hearts...

188
00:14:36,048 --> 00:14:39,462
as their most precious
possession, their only child,

189
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:41,688
disappeared into the night.

190
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:56,458
Many sad and lonely years
passed by...

191
00:14:56,535 --> 00:14:59,949
for King Stefan
and his people.

192
00:15:00,026 --> 00:15:03,977
But as the time for the Princess's
sixteenth birthday drew near,

193
00:15:04,054 --> 00:15:07,661
the entire kingdom
began to rejoice.

194
00:15:07,737 --> 00:15:11,189
For everyone knew that
as long as Maleficent's domain,

195
00:15:11,228 --> 00:15:15,754
the Forbidden Mountains, thundered
with her wrath and frustration,

196
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,631
her evil prophecy
had not yet been fulfilled.

197
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,520
It's incredible!

198
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:36,318
Sixteen years,
and not a trace of her.

199
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:39,617
She couldn't have vanished
into thin air!

200
00:15:39,695 --> 00:15:43,531
Are you sure you
searched everywhere?

201
00:15:43,607 --> 00:15:45,871
Yes, yes, uh, everywhere.

202
00:15:45,948 --> 00:15:47,827
- We all did.
- Yeah, yeah!

203
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,938
Uh-huh, yeah.

204
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:52,661
And what about the town?
The forest? The mountains?

205
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:55,846
Yeah, we searched mountains,
uh, uh, uh, uh, forests...

206
00:15:55,923 --> 00:15:58,454
and, uh, houses, and, uh--

207
00:15:58,493 --> 00:16:01,293
Let me see.
Uh, and all the cradles.

208
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,669
- Cradle?
- Yep, yep.

209
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,741
Every cradle.

210
00:16:06,818 --> 00:16:09,235
Cradle?

211
00:16:09,312 --> 00:16:11,806
Did you hear that, my pet?

212
00:16:11,883 --> 00:16:16,447
All these years, they've
been looking for a baby.

213
00:16:27,765 --> 00:16:30,105
Fools!

214
00:16:30,144 --> 00:16:33,135
Idiots! Imbeciles!

215
00:16:47,753 --> 00:16:49,787
Oh, they're hopeless.

216
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:53,277
A disgrace to
the forces of evil.

217
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:59,684
My pet, you are my last hope.

218
00:16:59,761 --> 00:17:02,407
Circle far and wide.

219
00:17:02,485 --> 00:17:05,055
Search for a maid
of sixteen...

220
00:17:05,132 --> 00:17:07,356
with hair of sunshine gold...

221
00:17:07,434 --> 00:17:10,119
and lips red as the rose.

222
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,610
Go, and do not fail me.

223
00:17:18,636 --> 00:17:21,015
And so, for sixteen long years,

224
00:17:21,054 --> 00:17:24,353
the whereabouts of the Princess
remained a mystery.

225
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,422
While deep in the forest
in a woodcutter's cottage,

226
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:31,181
the good fairies carried out
their well-laid plan.

227
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,787
Living like mortals, they had
reared the child as their own...

228
00:17:34,865 --> 00:17:38,164
and called her Briar Rose.

229
00:17:42,038 --> 00:17:44,378
On this, her sixteenth birthday,

230
00:17:44,456 --> 00:17:46,642
the good fairies
had planned a party...

231
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:50,594
and something extra special
for a surprise.

232
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:53,624
- Well, now, how about this one?
- This is the one I picked.

233
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:55,696
Oh, she'll look
beautiful in that.

234
00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:58,112
- Now, I thought a few changes here.
- Uh-huh.

235
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:01,642
- And don't forget a pretty bow.
- Yes, and raise the shoulder line.

236
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:04,021
- We'll make it blue.
- Oh, no, dear, pink.

237
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,939
- But--
- Of course, we'll need a few pleats.

238
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:08,318
Yes, but how are we gonna
get her out of the house?

239
00:18:08,356 --> 00:18:10,390
Oh, I'll think of something.

240
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:14,111
Well, and what are
you three dears up to?

241
00:18:14,188 --> 00:18:16,221
- Up to?
- Up to?
- Up to?

242
00:18:16,298 --> 00:18:18,216
Uh, uh-- Th-Th-The--
Cr-- Uh--

243
00:18:18,293 --> 00:18:20,518
Well, we-- Uh, we-- W-We--

244
00:18:20,595 --> 00:18:24,392
- We want you to pick some berries.
- That's it, berries!

245
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,772
- Berries?
- Lots of berries.

246
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:30,800
- But I-I picked berries yesterday.
- Oh, w-we need more, dear.

247
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:33,792
- Lots, lots more.
- Yes!

248
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:38,126
- Now don't hurry back, dear.
- But don't go too far.

249
00:18:38,205 --> 00:18:40,544
- And don't speak to strangers.
- Good-bye, dear.

250
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,920
- Good-bye!
- Good-bye!
- Good-bye!

251
00:18:45,378 --> 00:18:48,677
- I wonder if she suspects.
- Of course not.

252
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:51,976
Come on!
Oh, will she be surprised.

253
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:54,048
A real birthday party.

254
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,004
With a real birthday cake.

255
00:18:56,082 --> 00:18:58,882
Yes, and a dress
a princess can be proud of.

256
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:02,911
- I'll get the wands.
- Yes, you can, uh-- The wands?

257
00:19:02,988 --> 00:19:05,672
- Oh, no!
- No magic!

258
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,052
But the sixteen years
are almost over.

259
00:19:08,129 --> 00:19:10,238
We're taking no chances.

260
00:19:10,277 --> 00:19:13,116
But I've never baked
a fancy cake.

261
00:19:13,154 --> 00:19:15,110
Oh, you won't have to, dear.

262
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:17,259
I'm going to bake the cake.

263
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:19,868
- You?
- Oh, she's always wanted to, dear.

264
00:19:19,945 --> 00:19:22,284
- And this is her last chance.
- Well--

265
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:26,006
I'm going to make it fifteen layers
with pink and blue forget-me-nots.

266
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,384
And I'm making the dress.

267
00:19:28,462 --> 00:19:31,416
But you can't sew,
and she's never cooked.

268
00:19:31,492 --> 00:19:35,136
- Oh-ho-ho, it's simple!
- All you do is follow the book.

269
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:38,896
Up here, dear.
You can be the dummy.

270
00:19:38,973 --> 00:19:42,311
Well, I still say
we ought to use magic.

271
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:51,365
''Flour, three cups.''

272
00:19:51,404 --> 00:19:54,281
Cups, cups, cups, cups,
cups, cups, cups.

273
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:57,120
Oh.

274
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:00,227
One, two, three.

275
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:04,140
- What's that for?
- Well, it's got to have
a hole in the bottom.

276
00:20:04,217 --> 00:20:07,516
That's for the feet
to go through.

277
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:12,772
- It's pink.
- Oh, lovely shade, isn't it?

278
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:16,378
- But I wanted it blue.
- Now, dear,

279
00:20:16,455 --> 00:20:18,565
we decided
pink was her color.

280
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:21,634
You decided!

281
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:35,867
''Two eggs. Fold in gently.''

282
00:20:35,945 --> 00:20:38,477
Fold? Uh, oh, well.

283
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,804
I can't breathe!

284
00:20:45,881 --> 00:20:48,451
Let me out of here.

285
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:53,592
- It looks awful.
- That's because it's on you, dear.

286
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,968
''Now, yeast, one tsp.''
''Tsp.''?

287
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,193
One teaspoon.

288
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,147
- Oh, one teaspoon, of course!
- Hmm!

289
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:11,546
Oh, gracious,
how that child has grown.

290
00:21:11,624 --> 00:21:14,808
Oh, it seems only yesterday
we brought her here.

291
00:21:14,885 --> 00:21:17,493
Just a tiny baby.

292
00:21:20,294 --> 00:21:24,053
- Why, Merryweather.
- What ever is the matter, dear?

293
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,547
After today,
she'll be a princess,

294
00:21:26,624 --> 00:21:29,348
and we won't have
any Briar Rose.

295
00:21:29,425 --> 00:21:31,611
- Oh, Flora!
- Now, now, now, now.

296
00:21:31,688 --> 00:21:35,255
Well, we-- we all knew
this day had to come.

297
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,980
But why did it
have to come so soon?

298
00:21:38,057 --> 00:21:41,931
After all, we've had her
for sixteen years.

299
00:21:42,008 --> 00:21:44,348
Sixteen wonderful years.

300
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:50,947
Oh, gracious! We're acting
like a lot of ninnies.

301
00:21:51,024 --> 00:21:54,783
Come on. She'll be back
before we get started.

302
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:39,441
You hear that, Samson?

303
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,858
Beautiful.

304
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:46,961
What is it?

305
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:50,490
Come on.
Let's find out.

306
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:53,982
Aw, come on.
For an extra bucket of oats?

307
00:23:55,324 --> 00:23:58,661
And a few carrots?

308
00:23:58,739 --> 00:24:01,041
Hup, boy!

309
00:24:29,277 --> 00:24:31,731
Whoa!

310
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:45,505
No carrots.

311
00:24:57,053 --> 00:25:00,275
I wonder

312
00:25:00,314 --> 00:25:03,613
I wonder

313
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,794
I wonder why
each little bird

314
00:25:07,871 --> 00:25:10,441
Has a someone

315
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:13,473
To sing to

316
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,619
Sweet things to

317
00:25:16,696 --> 00:25:21,913
A gay little love melody

318
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:27,322
I wonder

319
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:30,199
I wonder

320
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:33,729
If my heart keeps singing

321
00:25:33,806 --> 00:25:37,373
Will my song go winging

322
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:40,595
To someone

323
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:44,087
Who'll find me

324
00:25:44,165 --> 00:25:49,420
And bring back a love song

325
00:25:49,497 --> 00:25:53,563
To me

326
00:25:58,091 --> 00:26:00,277
Oh, dear.

327
00:26:00,316 --> 00:26:04,038
Why do they still
treat me like a child?

328
00:26:05,303 --> 00:26:07,413
Who?

329
00:26:07,452 --> 00:26:11,441
Aunt Flora and Fauna
and Merryweather.

330
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:16,275
They never want me
to meet anyone.

331
00:26:20,188 --> 00:26:22,337
But you know something?

332
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,562
I fooled them.

333
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:27,133
I have met someone.

334
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,936
Who?

335
00:26:31,544 --> 00:26:33,961
Who? Who?

336
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:36,877
Oh, a prince.

337
00:26:38,757 --> 00:26:42,746
Well, he's tall
and handsome and--

338
00:26:42,823 --> 00:26:44,741
and so romantic.

339
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:51,954
Oh, we walk together
and talk together;

340
00:26:52,031 --> 00:26:55,100
and just before
we say good-bye,

341
00:26:55,139 --> 00:26:57,900
he takes me in his arms...

342
00:26:57,977 --> 00:27:01,084
and then...

343
00:27:01,123 --> 00:27:03,348
I wake up.

344
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,604
Yes, it's only in my dreams.

345
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:12,287
But they say if you dream
a thing more than once,

346
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:14,359
it's sure to come true;

347
00:27:14,436 --> 00:27:17,735
and I've seen him
so many times.

348
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,399
You know, Samson,

349
00:27:59,476 --> 00:28:03,120
there was something strange
about that voice.

350
00:28:03,197 --> 00:28:06,649
Too beautiful to be real.

351
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:10,716
Maybe it was some mysterious
being, a wood sprite or a--

352
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:15,627
Here, stop!

353
00:28:44,285 --> 00:28:47,009
Why, it's my dream prince.

354
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:52,917
Your Highness.

355
00:28:58,442 --> 00:29:01,510
You know, I'm really not
supposed to speak to strangers,

356
00:29:01,588 --> 00:29:03,889
but we've met before.

357
00:29:03,966 --> 00:29:06,344
I know you

358
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:11,754
I walked with you
once upon a dream

359
00:29:11,831 --> 00:29:14,362
I know you

360
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:16,473
The gleam in your eyes

361
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:19,734
Is so familiar a gleam

362
00:29:19,811 --> 00:29:23,148
Yet I know it's true

363
00:29:23,226 --> 00:29:27,790
That visions
are seldom all they seem

364
00:29:27,868 --> 00:29:30,284
But if I know you

365
00:29:30,361 --> 00:29:32,739
I know what you'll do

366
00:29:32,817 --> 00:29:35,923
You'll love me at once

367
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,136
The way you did
once upon a dream

368
00:29:51,347 --> 00:29:53,993
But if I know you

369
00:29:54,032 --> 00:29:56,871
I know what you'll do

370
00:29:56,909 --> 00:29:59,633
You'll love me at once

371
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,551
- The way you--
- The way you did

372
00:30:01,628 --> 00:30:06,193
Once upon a dream

373
00:30:07,537 --> 00:30:09,953
Oh! Oh!

374
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:13,252
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

375
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:15,746
Oh, it, uh, wasn't that.

376
00:30:15,823 --> 00:30:18,392
It's just that you're a-- a--

377
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,619
- A stranger?
- Mm-hmm.

378
00:30:20,657 --> 00:30:23,303
But don't you remember?
We've met before.

379
00:30:23,342 --> 00:30:26,718
- We-- We have?
- Why, of course. You said so yourself.

380
00:30:26,795 --> 00:30:28,598
Once upon a dream.

381
00:30:28,675 --> 00:30:31,169
I know you

382
00:30:31,245 --> 00:30:36,769
I walked with you
once upon a dream

383
00:30:36,846 --> 00:30:39,493
I know you

384
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:45,325
The gleam in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam

385
00:30:45,402 --> 00:30:51,616
And I know it's true

386
00:30:51,693 --> 00:30:57,256
That visions
are seldom all they seem

387
00:30:57,295 --> 00:31:00,594
But if I know you

388
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:03,318
I know what you'll do

389
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:06,540
You'll love me at once

390
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,188
The way you did

391
00:31:09,264 --> 00:31:17,550
Once upon a dream

392
00:31:23,076 --> 00:31:25,032
Who are you?

393
00:31:25,109 --> 00:31:27,333
What's your name?

394
00:31:27,411 --> 00:31:29,444
Hmm?

395
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:32,091
Oh, my name.

396
00:31:32,168 --> 00:31:34,700
Why, it's-- it's--

397
00:31:34,777 --> 00:31:37,500
Oh, no, no, I can't! I--

398
00:31:37,577 --> 00:31:39,726
- Good-bye!
- But when will I see you again?

399
00:31:39,803 --> 00:31:43,332
- Oh, never! Never!
- Never?

400
00:31:43,409 --> 00:31:47,053
- Well, maybe someday.
- When? Tomorrow?

401
00:31:47,092 --> 00:31:49,777
Oh, no! This evening!

402
00:31:49,816 --> 00:31:53,115
- Where?
- At the cottage in the glen.

403
00:32:01,632 --> 00:32:03,856
There. Ooh!

404
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:12,489
- Well, what do you think of it?
- Why, it's--

405
00:32:12,528 --> 00:32:15,519
It's a very unusual cake,
isn't it?

406
00:32:15,596 --> 00:32:19,624
Yes. Of course, it'll be
much stiffer after it's baked.

407
00:32:19,663 --> 00:32:23,499
Of course, dear. Um, what
do you think of the dress?

408
00:32:23,576 --> 00:32:25,533
Well, i-it's, uh--

409
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,062
I-It's not exactly the way
it is in the book, is it?

410
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,058
Oh, I improved it.

411
00:32:31,134 --> 00:32:35,507
But perhaps if I added a few more
ruffles, uh-- Uh, what do you think?

412
00:32:35,585 --> 00:32:40,457
Um, I think so.
What do you think, Merryweather?

413
00:32:40,496 --> 00:32:44,293
I think we've had enough
of this nonsense!

414
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:48,743
I think we ought to think of Rose
and what she'll think of this mess.

415
00:32:48,821 --> 00:32:51,314
I still think
what I thunk before.

416
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,845
I'm going to get those wands.

417
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:59,332
You know, I think she's right.

418
00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:01,633
Here they are, good as new.

419
00:33:01,711 --> 00:33:05,738
Ah, ah, ah!
C-C-C-C-C-Careful, Merryweather!

420
00:33:05,777 --> 00:33:08,616
Quick, lock the doors.

421
00:33:08,693 --> 00:33:13,296
Uh, Fauna, you close the windows.
Oh, block up every cranny.

422
00:33:13,374 --> 00:33:16,673
We can't take any chances.

423
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,204
Now, you take care
of the cake.

424
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:21,583
- While I--
- Clean the room, dear.

425
00:33:21,622 --> 00:33:24,959
And I'll make the dress.
Now hurry!

426
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:27,031
Ooh!

427
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:30,599
Come on, bucket, mop, broom.

428
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:33,131
Flora says clean up the room.

429
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,988
And now to make
a lovely dress...

430
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,827
fit to grace a fair princess.

431
00:33:48,554 --> 00:33:51,814
Eggs, flour, minute--

432
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:55,880
Just do it like it says here
in the book. I'll put on the candles.

433
00:34:48,018 --> 00:34:51,240
Oh, no, not pink.
Make it blue.

434
00:34:52,546 --> 00:34:55,039
Merryweather!
Make it pink.

435
00:34:58,991 --> 00:35:01,330
Make it blue.

436
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:04,323
Oh, pink!

437
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:09,272
Blue.

438
00:35:57,881 --> 00:36:01,103
Ohh, now look
what you've done!

439
00:36:02,138 --> 00:36:04,670
Shh, shh, shh! Listen.

440
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:08,507
- It's Rose.
- She's back. Enough
of this foolishness.

441
00:36:12,113 --> 00:36:15,911
Make it pink.
Now hide, quick!

442
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:20,860
- Blue.
- Aunt Flora!

443
00:36:23,316 --> 00:36:26,768
Good gracious!
Who left the mop running?

444
00:36:27,805 --> 00:36:29,646
Stop, mop.

445
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:33,942
Aunt Flora! Fauna!

446
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,359
Merryweather!

447
00:36:38,354 --> 00:36:42,267
Where is everybody? Oh!

448
00:36:42,345 --> 00:36:44,608
- Surprise! Surprise!
- Surprise! Surprise!
- Surprise!

449
00:36:44,685 --> 00:36:47,715
- Happy birthday!
- Oh, you darlings!

450
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:50,324
This is the happiest day
of my life.

451
00:36:50,401 --> 00:36:52,664
Everything's so wonderful.

452
00:36:52,703 --> 00:36:55,733
-Just wait 'til you meet him.
- Him?

453
00:36:55,772 --> 00:36:59,646
- Rose!
- Y-You've met some stranger?

454
00:36:59,723 --> 00:37:02,945
Oh, he's not a stranger.
We've met before.

455
00:37:03,023 --> 00:37:05,172
- You have?
- Where?

456
00:37:05,249 --> 00:37:07,550
Once upon a dream.

457
00:37:07,627 --> 00:37:09,851
I know you

458
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:15,645
I walked with you
once upon a dream

459
00:37:15,722 --> 00:37:18,215
- She's in love!
- Oh, no.

460
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:20,516
This is terrible.

461
00:37:20,594 --> 00:37:23,739
Why? After all,
I am sixteen.

462
00:37:23,778 --> 00:37:27,230
- It isn't that, dear.
- You're already betrothed.

463
00:37:27,308 --> 00:37:29,917
- Betrothed?
- Since the day you were born.

464
00:37:29,994 --> 00:37:33,791
- To Prince Phillip, dear.
- But that's impossible.

465
00:37:33,868 --> 00:37:36,707
How could I marry a prince?
I'd have to be--

466
00:37:36,746 --> 00:37:39,162
- A princess.
- And you are, dear.

467
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:41,272
Princess Aurora.

468
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:44,993
Tonight, we're taking you back
to your father, King Stefan.

469
00:37:45,071 --> 00:37:47,449
But-- But I can't.

470
00:37:47,487 --> 00:37:50,747
He's coming here tonight.
I promised to meet him.

471
00:37:50,786 --> 00:37:55,735
I'm sorry, child, but you must
never see that young man again.

472
00:37:55,812 --> 00:37:58,689
Oh, no! No!

473
00:37:58,766 --> 00:38:02,794
I can't believe it! No! No!

474
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,275
And we thought
she'd be so happy.

475
00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:27,578
No sign of her yet, Hubert.

476
00:38:27,655 --> 00:38:31,644
'Course not. It's a good
half hour 'til sunset.

477
00:38:35,712 --> 00:38:38,205
Ah, excellent bird.

478
00:38:39,548 --> 00:38:41,887
Oh, now, come, man!

479
00:38:41,926 --> 00:38:44,266
Buck up! Battle's over!

480
00:38:44,344 --> 00:38:46,722
Girl's as good as here.

481
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,829
I'm sorry, Hubert,
but after sixteen years...

482
00:38:49,906 --> 00:38:52,170
of worrying, never knowing--

483
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,893
The past! All in the past.

484
00:39:00,725 --> 00:39:04,024
Tonight, we toast
the future...

485
00:39:04,101 --> 00:39:07,515
with something I've been saving
for sixteen years.

486
00:39:10,316 --> 00:39:12,732
Here. To the future!

487
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,265
Right, Hubert.
To the future.

488
00:39:18,795 --> 00:39:21,364
-Skumps, skumps
-Skumps

489
00:39:21,441 --> 00:39:24,933
-A toast to this night
- The outlook is rosy

490
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,774
The future is bright

491
00:39:26,852 --> 00:39:30,726
Our children will marry
Our kingdoms unite

492
00:39:30,803 --> 00:39:33,182
Skumps, skumps

493
00:39:33,258 --> 00:39:35,751
Skumps

494
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:41,698
Ah, excellent vintage.

495
00:39:46,686 --> 00:39:50,138
- And now, to the new home, eh?
- New home?

496
00:39:50,215 --> 00:39:52,554
Children need a nest
of their own, what?

497
00:39:52,632 --> 00:39:55,892
Place to raise
their little brood, eh?

498
00:39:55,969 --> 00:39:58,118
Well, I suppose in time--

499
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:00,726
Of course! To the home!

500
00:40:00,803 --> 00:40:02,491
-Skumps
-Skumps

501
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:05,637
-A toast to the home
- One grander by far

502
00:40:05,714 --> 00:40:07,593
Than a palace in Rome

503
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:11,507
Uh, let me fill up your glass.
That glass was all foam.

504
00:40:11,584 --> 00:40:13,962
Skumps, skumps

505
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:16,303
Skumps

506
00:40:23,784 --> 00:40:26,278
The plans!

507
00:40:30,612 --> 00:40:33,949
Well, what do you think?
Nothing elaborate, of course.

508
00:40:34,028 --> 00:40:37,749
Forty bedrooms, dining hall.
Honeymoon cottage, really.

509
00:40:37,826 --> 00:40:40,971
You-- You mean, you're
building it already?

510
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:44,577
Built, man! Finished!
Lovebirds can move in tomorrow.

511
00:40:44,654 --> 00:40:48,951
Tomorrow? But, Hubert,
they're not even married yet.

512
00:40:49,028 --> 00:40:51,751
Take care of that tonight.
To the wedding!

513
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:55,397
Now hold on, Hubert. I haven't
even seen my daughter yet,

514
00:40:55,473 --> 00:40:57,352
and you're taking her
away from me.

515
00:40:57,391 --> 00:40:59,692
-Getting my Phillip, aren't you?
-Yes, but--

516
00:40:59,731 --> 00:41:01,917
Want to see our grandchildren,
don't we?

517
00:41:01,995 --> 00:41:04,488
- Of course, but, uh--
- There's no time to lose.

518
00:41:04,565 --> 00:41:07,787
Getting on in years.

519
00:41:07,826 --> 00:41:11,125
- To the wedding!
- Now, be reasonable, Hubert.

520
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:14,769
After all, Aurora knows
nothing about all this.

521
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:20,333
- Well?
- Well, it-- it may come
as quite a shock.

522
00:41:20,372 --> 00:41:23,786
Shock? My Phillip, a shock?

523
00:41:23,825 --> 00:41:26,433
What's wrong
with my Phillip?

524
00:41:26,509 --> 00:41:28,849
Nothing, Hubert.
I only meant--

525
00:41:28,927 --> 00:41:31,919
Why doesn't your daughter
like my son?

526
00:41:31,996 --> 00:41:34,950
- Now, now--
- I'm not so sure...

527
00:41:35,027 --> 00:41:37,673
my son likes your daughter!

528
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:41,126
- Now, see here.
- I'm not so sure my grandchildren...

529
00:41:41,203 --> 00:41:43,505
want you for a grandfather!

530
00:41:43,582 --> 00:41:46,190
Why, you, you unreasonable,

531
00:41:46,229 --> 00:41:49,336
- Huh? Who? Uh--
- pompous, blustering, old windbag!

532
00:41:49,413 --> 00:41:52,558
Unreasonable, pompous--
On guard, sir!

533
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:55,091
I warn you, Hubert,
this means war.

534
00:41:55,168 --> 00:41:58,237
Forward! For honor!
For country!

535
00:41:58,314 --> 00:42:01,113
Oh! Ohh!

536
00:42:06,409 --> 00:42:08,710
- Hey.
- What's this all about, anyway?

537
00:42:08,787 --> 00:42:12,393
No-- Nothing, Hubert.
Absolutely nothing!

538
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,964
Eh, children bound to fall
in love with each other.

539
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:18,301
Yeah. Precisely.
And as for grandchildren,

540
00:42:18,379 --> 00:42:22,100
I'll have the royal woodcarvers
start work on the cradle tomorrow.

541
00:42:22,176 --> 00:42:24,976
Splendid!
King-size, of course.

542
00:42:25,054 --> 00:42:28,046
Certainly.
To the woodcarvers guild.

543
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:45,156
His Royal Highness,
Prince Phillip!

544
00:42:45,233 --> 00:42:47,573
Phillip?

545
00:42:52,408 --> 00:42:55,860
Oh, Phillip! Phillip!

546
00:42:55,937 --> 00:42:57,931
Phillip! Ho, Phillip!

547
00:43:03,994 --> 00:43:06,027
H-Hurry, boy, hurry!

548
00:43:06,104 --> 00:43:08,060
Uh, change into
something suitable.

549
00:43:08,137 --> 00:43:10,439
Can't meet your future bride
looking like that.

550
00:43:10,516 --> 00:43:13,815
- But I have met her, Father.
- Yeah-- You have? Where?

551
00:43:13,854 --> 00:43:16,078
Once upon a dream.

552
00:43:16,155 --> 00:43:19,607
Oh, Phillip! Stop it!
Stop that! Wa-- Phillip!

553
00:43:19,685 --> 00:43:21,526
Phi-- Put me down!

554
00:43:21,603 --> 00:43:24,672
Now, what's all
this ''dream'' nonsense?

555
00:43:24,749 --> 00:43:27,396
It wasn't a dream, Father.
I really did meet her.

556
00:43:27,473 --> 00:43:30,772
Oh, the Princess Aurora? Good
heavens, we must tell Stefan.

557
00:43:30,849 --> 00:43:33,688
-Why, this is the most amazing--
-I-I didn't say it was Aurora.

558
00:43:33,765 --> 00:43:35,606
You most certainly did.
You-- You said--

559
00:43:35,683 --> 00:43:38,943
I said I met the girl I was going
to marry. I don't know who she was.

560
00:43:39,021 --> 00:43:42,435
- A peasant girl, I suppose.
- A-- A peasant g-girl?

561
00:43:42,512 --> 00:43:44,583
You-- You're going
to marry a g--

562
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,575
Why, Phillip, you're joking.

563
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:54,251
Isn't he?

564
00:43:54,328 --> 00:43:57,473
Oh! Y-Y-You can't
do this to me.

565
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:02,307
Give up the throne, the kingdom,
for some-- some nobody?

566
00:44:02,384 --> 00:44:04,724
By Harry, I won't have it!

567
00:44:04,763 --> 00:44:08,177
You're a prince, and you're
going to marry a princess!

568
00:44:08,254 --> 00:44:10,248
Now, Father,
you're living in the past.

569
00:44:10,326 --> 00:44:12,244
This is the fourteenth century.
Nowadays--

570
00:44:12,321 --> 00:44:16,579
Nowadays I'm still the king! And I
command you to come to your senses!

571
00:44:16,656 --> 00:44:18,497
- And marry the girl I love.
- Exactly!

572
00:44:18,574 --> 00:44:22,180
- Good-bye, Father.
- Good-bye, Father.
Marry the girl you-- No, no!

573
00:44:22,257 --> 00:44:24,751
No, no, Phillip!
Stop! Come back!

574
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,976
Oh, Phillip!

575
00:44:31,196 --> 00:44:34,034
Phillip!

576
00:44:53,562 --> 00:44:57,360
How-- How will I
ever tell Stefan?

577
00:45:41,173 --> 00:45:43,552
Come along now.

578
00:45:54,255 --> 00:45:57,055
All right. In here, dear.

579
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,309
- Oh!
- Bolt the door, Merryweather.

580
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:06,185
Fauna, pull the drapes.

581
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:10,866
And now, dear,
if you'll just sit here.

582
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:15,316
This one last gift,
dear child, for thee,

583
00:46:15,394 --> 00:46:18,309
the symbol of thy royalty:

584
00:46:18,386 --> 00:46:21,877
a crown to wear
in grace and beauty,

585
00:46:21,954 --> 00:46:24,946
as is thy right
and royal duty.

586
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:32,350
- Now, dear--
- Come.

587
00:46:34,845 --> 00:46:38,067
Let her have
a few moments alone.

588
00:46:38,144 --> 00:46:40,292
It's that boy she met.

589
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:42,018
What ever are we going to do?

590
00:47:20,882 --> 00:47:25,984
Ohh! I don't see why she
has to marry any old prince.

591
00:47:26,061 --> 00:47:29,206
Now, that's not for us
to decide, dear.

592
00:47:40,218 --> 00:47:43,670
Maybe we should tell King Stefan
about the boy.

593
00:47:43,747 --> 00:47:46,546
- Well, why don't we?
- Listen!

594
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:48,773
Maleficent! Rose!

595
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:50,729
- Rose!
- Rose!

596
00:47:50,806 --> 00:47:53,760
-Oh, why did we leave her alone?
-No! No!
-Rose!

597
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:55,678
Rose!

598
00:48:14,477 --> 00:48:17,546
- Here.
- Rose!
- Rose!

599
00:48:17,623 --> 00:48:19,695
- Rose! Rose, where are you?
- Rose!
- Rose!

600
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:22,265
Where are you?

601
00:48:26,754 --> 00:48:30,551
Rose! Rose! Rose!

602
00:48:42,214 --> 00:48:44,976
- Rose! Rose!
- Rose!

603
00:48:55,758 --> 00:48:56,754
- Rose!
- Rose!
- Rose!

604
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:10,949
- Rose!
- Rose!
- Don't touch anything!

605
00:49:11,026 --> 00:49:12,982
Anything! Anything!

606
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:16,819
Touch the spindle.
Touch it, I say.

607
00:49:21,845 --> 00:49:25,221
You poor, simple fools,

608
00:49:25,298 --> 00:49:27,062
thinking you could defeat me.

609
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:30,439
Me, the mistress of all evil!

610
00:49:31,781 --> 00:49:35,503
Well, here's your
precious princess.

611
00:49:41,487 --> 00:49:44,824
- Rose!
- Oh, Rose!

612
00:49:44,902 --> 00:49:49,697
Oh, I'll never
forgive myself.

613
00:49:49,774 --> 00:49:52,498
We're all to blame.

614
00:50:00,785 --> 00:50:04,506
Stefan, th-there's-- there's something
important I have to tell you.

615
00:50:04,583 --> 00:50:06,463
Uh, not now, Hubert.

616
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,573
But-- But it's a-about Phillip.

617
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:11,680
Phillip? Oh, yes,
of course, Phillip.

618
00:50:11,757 --> 00:50:15,516
- Why, where is the boy?
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

619
00:50:15,709 --> 00:50:17,512
-Well, send for him immediately.
-But--

620
00:50:17,588 --> 00:50:19,583
Shh!

621
00:50:21,387 --> 00:50:23,458
The sun has set.

622
00:50:23,535 --> 00:50:26,757
Make ready to welcome
your princess.

623
00:51:25,379 --> 00:51:28,678
Poor King Stefan and the Queen.

624
00:51:28,717 --> 00:51:31,516
They'll be heartbroken
when they find out.

625
00:51:34,087 --> 00:51:36,964
- They're not going to.
- They aren't?

626
00:51:37,042 --> 00:51:40,993
- But--
- We'll put them all to sleep
until Rose awakens.

627
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,315
Come.

628
00:51:57,604 --> 00:52:03,627
Sleeping Beauty fair

629
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:08,615
Gold of sunshine

630
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:12,489
In your hair

631
00:52:13,526 --> 00:52:16,480
Lips that shame

632
00:52:16,557 --> 00:52:20,201
The red, red rose

633
00:52:21,851 --> 00:52:24,881
Dreaming of true love

634
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:30,674
In slumber repose

635
00:52:30,713 --> 00:52:34,703
One day

636
00:52:34,742 --> 00:52:38,578
He will come

637
00:52:38,654 --> 00:52:47,017
Riding out of the dawn

638
00:52:47,094 --> 00:52:49,933
And you'll awaken

639
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:54,767
To love's first kiss

640
00:52:54,806 --> 00:52:57,107
'Til then

641
00:52:57,184 --> 00:52:59,601
Sleeping Beauty

642
00:52:59,678 --> 00:53:03,629
Sleep on

643
00:53:04,512 --> 00:53:08,578
One day you'll awaken

644
00:53:08,655 --> 00:53:12,107
To love's first kiss

645
00:53:13,528 --> 00:53:16,520
'Til then

646
00:53:16,597 --> 00:53:21,124
Sleeping Beauty

647
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:26,610
Sleep on

648
00:53:34,398 --> 00:53:37,428
Well,just been talking
to Phillip.

649
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:42,033
Seems he's fallen in love
with some-- peasant girl.

650
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:44,564
Peasant girl?

651
00:53:44,641 --> 00:53:47,786
Yes? Yes?

652
00:53:47,864 --> 00:53:50,664
The peasant girl? Who is she?
Where did he meet her?

653
00:53:50,741 --> 00:53:54,385
Uh,just some
peasant girl he met--

654
00:53:54,424 --> 00:53:56,303
Where? Where?

655
00:53:56,342 --> 00:54:00,179
Once upon a dream.

656
00:54:00,256 --> 00:54:04,130
Once upon a dre--
Rose! Prince Phillip!

657
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:06,739
Oh! Oh!

658
00:54:09,924 --> 00:54:12,647
Come on. We've got to
get back to the cottage.

659
00:54:58,186 --> 00:55:00,257
Come in.

660
00:55:28,494 --> 00:55:30,681
Well!

661
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:34,018
This is a pleasant surprise.

662
00:55:34,095 --> 00:55:37,624
I set my trap for a peasant,
and lo,

663
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:39,772
I catch a prince.

664
00:55:42,804 --> 00:55:44,798
Away with him.

665
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:47,944
But gently, my pets.
Gently.

666
00:55:49,862 --> 00:55:53,084
I have plans
for our royal guest.

667
00:56:24,967 --> 00:56:26,386
- Maleficent!
- Maleficent!
- Maleficent!

668
00:56:26,463 --> 00:56:29,071
She's got Prince Phillip!

669
00:56:29,148 --> 00:56:31,948
At the Forbidden Mountain.

670
00:56:32,025 --> 00:56:34,403
But we can't--
we can't go there.

671
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,240
We can, and we must!

672
00:58:53,628 --> 00:58:56,582
What a pity Prince Phillip
can't be here...

673
00:58:56,659 --> 00:58:59,344
to enjoy the celebration.

674
00:59:01,302 --> 00:59:05,099
Come. We must go to the dungeon
and cheer him up.

675
00:59:57,275 --> 00:59:59,653
Oh, come now, Prince Phillip.

676
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:02,377
Why so melancholy?

677
01:00:02,454 --> 01:00:05,638
A wondrous future
lies before you.

678
01:00:05,677 --> 01:00:08,477
You, the destined hero...

679
01:00:08,555 --> 01:00:11,661
of a charming fairy tale
come true.

680
01:00:16,073 --> 01:00:19,870
Behold, King Stefan's castle.

681
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,442
And in yonder topmost tower,

682
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:25,128
dreaming of her true love,

683
01:00:25,166 --> 01:00:28,004
the Princess Aurora.

684
01:00:29,232 --> 01:00:32,301
But see the gracious
whim of fate.

685
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:35,562
Why, 'tis the selfsame
peasant maid...

686
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:39,436
who won the heart of
our noble prince but yesterday.

687
01:00:42,353 --> 01:00:46,343
She is indeed
most wondrous fair,

688
01:00:47,532 --> 01:00:50,217
gold of sunshine
in her hair,

689
01:00:50,295 --> 01:00:54,553
lips that shame
the red, red rose.

690
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:58,696
In ageless sleep,
she finds repose.

691
01:01:00,921 --> 01:01:03,376
The years roll by.

692
01:01:03,454 --> 01:01:08,326
But a hundred years to
a steadfast heart are but a day.

693
01:01:08,403 --> 01:01:12,047
And now, the gates
of a dungeon part,

694
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:16,535
and our prince
is free to go his way.

695
01:01:16,613 --> 01:01:20,487
Off he rides
on his noble steed--

696
01:01:20,564 --> 01:01:24,707
a valiant figure,
straight and tall--

697
01:01:24,784 --> 01:01:26,893
to wake his love...

698
01:01:26,971 --> 01:01:30,270
with love's first kiss...

699
01:01:30,347 --> 01:01:35,372
and prove that true love
conquers all!

700
01:01:38,633 --> 01:01:41,280
Why, you, you, y--

701
01:01:44,542 --> 01:01:48,148
Come, my pet. Let us leave
our noble prince...

702
01:01:48,225 --> 01:01:51,524
with these happy thoughts.

703
01:01:54,938 --> 01:01:58,007
A most gratifying day.

704
01:02:02,573 --> 01:02:05,642
For the first time
in sixteen years,

705
01:02:05,719 --> 01:02:08,749
I shall sleep well.

706
01:02:23,751 --> 01:02:26,244
Shh! No time to explain.

707
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,446
Wait, Prince Phillip.
The road to true love...

708
01:02:37,523 --> 01:02:40,400
may be barred by still
many more dangers...

709
01:02:40,477 --> 01:02:42,625
which you alone
will have to face.

710
01:02:42,702 --> 01:02:47,382
So arm thyself with this
enchanted shield of virtue...

711
01:02:47,421 --> 01:02:50,566
and this mighty
sword of truth,

712
01:02:50,644 --> 01:02:54,711
for these weapons of righteousness
will triumph over evil.

713
01:02:54,788 --> 01:02:57,357
Now, come. We must hurry.

714
01:03:42,475 --> 01:03:44,508
Phillip, watch out!

715
01:04:38,678 --> 01:04:42,744
Silence! You, tell
those fools to--

716
01:04:42,783 --> 01:04:46,082
No! No!

717
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:52,489
Watch out, Phillip!

718
01:04:58,973 --> 01:05:02,080
Hurry! Hurry, Phillip!

719
01:05:13,091 --> 01:05:16,812
A forest of thorns
shall be his tomb,

720
01:05:16,889 --> 01:05:20,188
borne through the skies
on a fog of doom!

721
01:05:20,265 --> 01:05:23,641
Now go with a curse
and serve me well.

722
01:05:23,718 --> 01:05:27,362
'Round Stefan's castle
cast my spell.

723
01:06:16,085 --> 01:06:18,655
No! It cannot be!

724
01:06:24,257 --> 01:06:28,054
Now shall you deal
with me, O Prince,

725
01:06:28,131 --> 01:06:30,740
and all the powers of hell!

726
01:07:14,169 --> 01:07:16,663
Up! Up this way!

727
01:07:31,778 --> 01:07:34,425
Now, sword of truth,
fly swift and sure...

728
01:07:34,503 --> 01:07:37,840
that evil die
and good endure!

729
01:09:15,937 --> 01:09:17,932
Ehhh-- Oh, oh, uh--

730
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:21,961
Forgive me, Hubert.
Ehh, uh, the wine. Now, uh--

731
01:09:22,038 --> 01:09:23,917
You, uh, were saying?

732
01:09:23,956 --> 01:09:27,754
Huh? I-I was?
Oh! Oh, yes.

733
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:32,395
Well, after all, Stefan,
this is the fourteenth century.

734
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:35,579
Yes. You, uh, you said that
a moment ago.

735
01:09:35,657 --> 01:09:38,572
Well, to come
right to the point,

736
01:09:38,649 --> 01:09:41,334
my son Phillip says
he's going to marry--

737
01:10:05,965 --> 01:10:08,688
It's Aurora! She's here!

738
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:15,594
A-And-And-And Phillip!

739
01:10:29,061 --> 01:10:31,861
Wh-- What does this mean, boy?

740
01:10:31,938 --> 01:10:34,584
I-I don't under--

741
01:10:37,271 --> 01:10:39,955
B-Bu-- But-But, uh--

742
01:10:45,711 --> 01:10:48,204
I-I don't understand.

743
01:11:11,568 --> 01:11:14,521
Why, Fauna,
what's the matter, dear?

744
01:11:14,599 --> 01:11:18,281
Oh, I just love
happy endings.

745
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:22,041
Yes, I do too-- t--

746
01:11:22,118 --> 01:11:24,304
Blue!

747
01:11:27,451 --> 01:11:31,249
- Pink.
- I know you

748
01:11:31,326 --> 01:11:36,428
- I walked with you once upon a dream
- Blue.

749
01:11:36,505 --> 01:11:38,959
I know you

750
01:11:39,037 --> 01:11:40,917
The gleam in your eyes

751
01:11:40,956 --> 01:11:44,100
Is so familiar a gleam

752
01:11:44,178 --> 01:11:47,016
Yet I know it's true

753
01:11:47,093 --> 01:11:51,735
That visions are seldom
all they seem

754
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:54,076
But if I know you

755
01:11:54,115 --> 01:11:56,186
I know what you'll do

756
01:11:56,263 --> 01:11:58,181
You'll love me at once

757
01:11:58,258 --> 01:12:00,252
The way you did once

758
01:12:00,329 --> 01:12:02,784
Upon

759
01:12:02,862 --> 01:12:10,995
A dream
