我认识你

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,074
我曾经在梦境中和你一起散步
I walked with you
once upon a dream

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,720
我认识你

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,715
你的眼神是如此的熟悉

那梦境是他们很少见到的

很多年来他们一直渴望一个孩子...

15
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,314
最后他们愿望成真

was granted.

16
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,076
他们的女儿出生了，他们称她为黎明的女神奥罗拉

18
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,229
是的，他们因她出生在黎明之后命名，
Yes, they named her
after the dawn...

19
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,154
因为她让他们的生活充满阳光

休伯特国王和菲利普王子！

他们的王国能够统一

61

小公主...

00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,838
我的礼物是，美丽

the gift of beauty.

63
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,312
一份礼物
One gift

64
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,075
美丽非常

65
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,232
阳光般的金黄色
Gold ofsunshine

66
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,790
是她头发的颜色
In her hair

67
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,672
嘴唇是那红色玫瑰羞愧的唇
Lips that shame
the red, red rose

68
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,354
她将随着春季走
She'll walk with springtime

69
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,911
无论她去到哪
Wherever she goes

70
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,349
小公主...
Tiny princess...

71
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,432
我的礼物是，歌曲
my gift shall be
the gift of song.

72
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,600
一份礼物
One gift

73
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,639
歌唱的礼物
The gift ofsong

74
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:41,636
美妙的音色伴随她一生
Melody her whole life long

75
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:48,796
她的梦中情人
The nightingale's
her troubadour

76
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:56,878
带他悦耳的小夜曲到她的门
Bringing his sweet serenade
to her door

77
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,239
可爱的公主，我的礼物是--
Sweet princess,
my gift shall be the--

78
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,551
- 是巫婆莫力菲森
- 她来这干什么?
- Why, it's Maleficent.
- What does she want here?
- Shh!

79
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,191
嗯，相当耀眼的聚会，斯蒂芬国王
Well, quite a glittering
assemblage, King Stefan.

80
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,317
皇室，高贵的...
Royalty, nobility...

81
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,960
贵族，还有--
the gentry, and--

82
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,593
很有趣，甚至还有乌合之众
How quaint.
Even the rabble.

83
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,197
没有受到邀请真的让我感到非常哀伤
I really felt quite distressed
at not receiving an invitation.

84
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,113
- 你妄想
- 别这么说--
- You weren't wanted.
- Not wa--

85
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,397
噢，亲爱的，很难堪吧
Oh, dear, what
an awkward situation.

86
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,677
我很希望这仅仅是因为疏忽
I had hoped it was merely due
to some oversight.

87
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,274
如果是那样，我可以不怪罪你们
Well, in that event,
I'd best be on my way.

88
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,796
我们没有得罪你吧，阁下？
And you're not offended,
Your Excellency?

89
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,429
为什么，不，皇后
Why, no, Your Majesty.

90
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,239
为了表示我没有恶意...
And to show
I bear no ill will...

91
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,756
我也会给一份礼物给孩子
I, too, shall bestow
a gift on the child.

92
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,914
你们所有人好好听着
Listen well, all ofyou.

93
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,720
公主的确会在大家的爱戴下...
The princess shall indeed
grow in grace and beauty...

94
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,553
优美和美丽里成长
beloved by all who know her.

95
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,594
但是...
But...

96
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,195
在她16岁生日那天...
before the sun sets on
her sixteenth birthday...

97
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,831
她将在一个纺车的纱锭上扎破她的手指...
she shall prick her finger
on the spindle of a spinning wheel...

98
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,433
然后死去
and die.

99
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,988
噢，不要
Oh, no!

100
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,071
抓住那个巫婆!
Seize that creature!

101
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,435
退后，你们这些白痴!
Stand back, you fools!

102
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,756
别绝望，皇后
Don't despair, Your Majesties.

103
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,559
玛莉怀德还有一份礼物没给
Merryweather still
has her gift to give.

104
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,791
那么她能破解这个可怕的诅咒吗?
Then she can undo
this fearful curse?

105
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,472
噢，不，陛下
Oh, no, Sire.

106
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,597
这个巫婆的力量太大
Maleficent's powers
are far too great.

107
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,148
但她能帮助
But she can help.

108
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,079
- 但是--
- 尽你所能，宝贝
- But--
- Just do your best, dear.

109
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,388
是的，去吧
Yes, go on.

110
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,076
小公主...
Sweet princess...

111
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,720
据这个邪恶的巫婆说...
if through this
wicked witch's trick...

112
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,155
你的手指会被一个纱锭扎破...
a spindle should
your finger prick...

113
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,312
或许这仍有一点希望...
a ray of hope there
still may be in this...

114
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,198
我给你的礼物
the gift I give to thee.

115
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,229
不会死，你只是会在这个致命的预言下沉睡...
Not in death,
but just in sleep...
the fateful prophecy
you'll keep.

116
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,595
当你得到真爱的吻时，魔咒就会破解...
And from this slumber
you shall wake...

117
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,956
你也会在沉睡中醒来
when true love's kiss
the spell shall break.

118
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,517
真爱
Fortrue love

119
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:02,197
战胜一切
Conquers all

120
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,799
但是斯蒂芬国王，仍然担心她女儿的生命...
But King Stefan, still fearful
of his daughter's life...

121
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,668
所以他颁令所有王国内的手纺车轮...
did then and there decree that every
spinning wheel in the kingdom...

122
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,593
在那天都要被烧毁
should on that very day
be burned.

123
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,955
即刻生效
So 'twas done.

124
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,157
噢，愚蠢的举动！
Oh, silly fiddle-faddle!

125
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,518
现在，来一杯香浓的茶，亲爱的
Now, come have
a nice cup of tea, dear.

126
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,716
我确信总有解决的办法
I'm sure it'll
work out somehow.

127
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,633
大火并不能阻止巫婆的诅咒
Well, a bonfire
won't stop Maleficent.

128
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,790
当然不会，但什么能阻止？
Of course not.
But what will?

129
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,678
- 或许我们可以跟她评理
- 理由呢?
- Well, perhaps ifwe reason with her.
- Reason?

130
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,593
- 和巫婆?
- 她不会穷凶极恶的
- With Maleficent?
- Well, she can't be all bad.

131
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,557
噢，她就是这么一个人
Oh, yes, she can!

132
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,111
噢，我真想把她变成又胖又老的蟾蜍
Ooh, I'd like to turn her
into a fat, old hoptoad.

133
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,272
亲爱的，这可不是你说想做就能做到的
Now, dear, that isn't
a very nice thing to say.

134
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,716
我们没有这个能力
你知道我们的魔法有限
Besides, we can't. You know
our magic doesn't work that way.

135
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,110
我们只能带来欢乐与幸福
It can only do good, dear,
to bring joy and happiness.

136
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,236
那样做会使我很快乐
Well, that would
make me happy.

137
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,835
但是一定有什么办法的
But there must be some way.

138
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,197
- 有了!
- 有了?
- There is!
- There is?

139
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,238
- 是什么，弗洛拉?
- 我将--
- What is it, Flora?
- I'm going to--

140
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,756
嘘，嘘，嘘!
小心隔墙有耳
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!
Even walls have ears.

141
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,679
跟我来
Follow me.

142
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,514
我要把她变成一朵花
I'll turn her into a flower.

143
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,956
- 巫婆吗?
- 不是，亲爱的，是公主
- Maleficent?
- Oh, no, dear. The princess.

144
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,508
噢，她将变成一朵可爱的花
Oh, she'd make
a lovely flower.

145
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,239
你想想，一朵花哪来的手指？
Don't you see? A flower
can't prick its finger.

146
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,595
- 没有
- 那就对了
- It hasn't any.
- That's right.

147
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,514
- 她将会很安全
- 直到巫婆送来一次霜害
- She'll be perfectly safe.
- Until Maleficent sends a frost.

148
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,115
是啊！噢，亲爱的
Yes! Eh-- Oh, dear.

149
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,351
她始终会毁灭你那朵可爱的花
She always ruins
your nicest flowers.

150
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,592
是的，她一定正希望我们做些那样的事呢
You're right. And she'll be
expecting us to do something like that.

151
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:17,595
噢！那么，什么才不是她希望的？她知道一切
Oh! Well, what won't she expect?
She knows everything.

152
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,591
不，不会的
Oh, but she doesn't, dear.

153
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,319
巫婆对于爱情...
Maleficent doesn't know
anything about love...

154
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,871
亲情或者是幸福快乐，一窍不通
or kindness or the joy
of helping others.

155
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,316
有时我并不认为她真的很快乐
You know, sometimes I don't
think she's really very happy.

156
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,073
当然，正是那样
That's it! Of course.

157
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,596
只有这些她才不能理解和预知
It's the only thing she can't
understand and won't expect.

158
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,714
现在，现在，我们要小心谨慎的计划
Now, now, now, we'll have
to plan it carefully.

159
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,554
让我想想...砍柴者的农舍
是的，是的，废弃了的农舍
Let's see. The woodcutter's cottage.
Yes, yes, the abandoned one.

160
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,995
当然国王和皇后会反对
Of course, the king
and queen will object.

161
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,469
但我们会解释这是唯一的办法--
But when we explain
it's the only way--

162
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,518
解释什么?
Explain what?

163
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,275
关于3个农妇养大一个弃孩...
About the three peasant women
raising a foundling child...

164
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,476
在森林的深处
deep in the forest.

165
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,997
- 哦？他们心肠太好了
- 他们是谁?
- Oh? Oh, that's very nice of them.
- Who are they?

166
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,833
转身
Turn around.

167
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,559
- 咦!
- 为什么是我们！
- Eww!
- Why, it's us!

168
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,359
- 啊
- 你的意思是，我们?
- Uh-huh.
- You mean, "we" us?

169
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,351
- 嗯
- 照顾孩子?
- Uh-huh.
- Take care of the baby?

170
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,035
- 为什么不呢?
- 噢，我愿意!
- Why not?
- Oh, I'd like that!

171
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,429
但是，我们得喂她吃饭--
Well, y-yes, but w-w-we'd
have to feed it a--

172
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,830
还有洗衣服穿衣服哄她睡觉
And wash it and dress it
and rock it to sleep.

173
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,753
- 噢，我喜欢
- 你真的认为我们能吗?
- Oh, I'd love it.
- Do you really think we can?

174
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,910
人类可以，我们也可以
If humans can do it,
so can we.

175
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,276
- 我们还有魔法可以帮助我们
- 是的
- And we'd have our magic to help us.
- That's right.

176
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,511
不，不，不，不!
不许用魔法!
No, no, no, no, no, no!
No magic!

177
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,795
我要拿走这些魔法棒
I'll take those wands
right now.

178
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,269
最好也除去那些翅膀
Oh, better get rid
of those wings too.

179
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,319
你是说像凡人一样生活16年?
You mean live like mortals?
For sixteen years?

180
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,949
但是，现在，我们不知道行不行的通--
- Uh-huh.
- B-Bu-- Now, now, we--
we don't know how.

181
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,871
没有了魔法我们什么也不能做
We've never done anything
without magic.

182
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,235
这可以让巫婆不会怀疑--
And that's why Maleficent
will never suspect--

183
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,151
- 但是，但是，谁来洗衣服?
- 还有做饭?
- But-- But who'll wash?
- And cook?

184
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,198
- 噢，我们大家一起努力
- 我来照顾孩子
- Oh, we'll all pitch in.
- I'll take care of the baby.

185
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,033
给我，亲爱的
Let me have it, dear.

186
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,954
跟我来，我们必须立刻告诉国王
Come along now. We must tell
Their Majesties at once.

187
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,920
- 弗洛拉?
- 弗洛拉?
- Flora?
- Flora?

188
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,836
所以国王和他的皇后怀着沉重的心情...
So the king and his queen
watched with heavy hearts...

189
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,310
看着他们唯一的最宝贵的女儿...
as their most precious
possession, their only child...

190
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,550
在那个夜晚消失
disappeared into the night.

191
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,314
斯蒂芬国王和他的百姓...
Many sad and lonely years
passed by...

192
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,790
在悲哀和孤单中度过多年
for King Stefan
and his people.

193
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,839
但当公主16岁的生日邻近的时候...
But as the time for the princess'
sixteenth birthday drew near...

194
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,515
整个王国开始欣喜若狂
the entire kingdom
began to rejoice.

195
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,036
因为众所周知，只要巫婆的领域...
For everyone knew that
as long as Maleficent's domain...

196
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,591
那座禁止的山，因为她的暴怒和挫折发出如雷之声...
the Forbidden Mountains, thundered
with her wrath and frustration...

197
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,638
她邪恶的预言就不会实现
her evil prophecy
had not yet been fulfilled.

198
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,440
难以置信！
It's incredible!

199
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,229
16年了，居然一点消息也没有
Sixteen years,
and not a trace of her.

200
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,517
她不会消失得无影无踪 !
She couldn't have vanished
into thin air!

201
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,434
你们确信每一处地方都搜查过了?
Are you sure you
searched everywhere?

202
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,750
是的，是的，都搜查过了
Yes, yes, uh, everywhere.

203
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,751
- 我们都搜查过了
- 是的，是的！
- We all did.
- Yeah, yeah!

204
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,831
是的
Uh-huh, yeah.

205
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,593
市镇呢? 森林? 深山?
And what about the town?
The forest? The mountains?

206
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,752
是的，我们搜查过深山
嗯，森林...
Yeah, we searched mountains,
uh, uh, uh, uh, forests...

207
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,354
还有，住宅，还有--
and, uh, houses, and, uh--

208
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,193
让我想想，还有所有的摇篮
Let me see.
Uh, and all the cradles.

209
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,556
- 摇篮?
- 是的
- Cradle?
- Yep, yep.

210
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,676
每个摇篮
Every cradle.

211
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,149
摇篮?
Cradle?

212
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,708
你听到了吗，我的宝贝?
Did you hear that, my pet?

213
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,351
这些年来，他们一直在寻找一个婴儿
All these years, they've
been looking for a baby.

214
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,989
傻瓜!
Fools!

215
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,038
白痴! 笨蛋!
Idiots! Imbeciles!

216
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,671
噢，他们不可救药了
Oh, they're hopeless.

217
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,196
这简直是邪恶势力的耻辱
A disgrace to
the forces of evil.

218
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,592
宝贝，你是我最后的希望了
My pet, you are my last hope.

219
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,319
到处飞一下
Circle far and wide.

220
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,960
搜查一个16岁的少女...
Search for a maid
of sixteen...

221
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,270
有着金黄色的头发...
with hair of sunshine gold...

222
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,033
和玫瑰红色的嘴唇
and lips red as the rose.

223
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,510
去吧，别让我失望
Go, and do not fail me.

224
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,955
16年来...
And so, for sixteen long years...

225
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,316
公主的行踪一直保持的很神秘
the whereabouts of the princess
remained a mystery.

226
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,392
在森林深处的一座砍柴者的农舍内...
While deep in the forest
in a woodcutter's cottage...

227
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,109
那些仙女正在执行她们安排得很好的计划
the good fairies carried out
their well-laid plan.

228
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,749
象凡人一样生活，她们对她就像自己的孩子那样养育...
Living like mortals, they had
reared the child as their own...

229
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,116
她们叫她布莱尔罗丝
and called her Briar Rose.

230
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,355
今天，她16岁的生日...
On this, her sixteenth birthday...

231
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,590
仙女们打算办一个舞会...
the good fairies
had planned a party...

232
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,559
给她一个意想不到的惊喜
and something extra special
for a surprise.

233
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,598
- 那么，这个呢?
- 这个是我选的
- Well, now, how about this one?
- This is the one I picked.

234
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,636
噢，她穿起来一定很漂亮
Oh, she'll look
beautiful in that.

235
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,075
- 我认为这应该做点改变
- Now, I thought a few changes here.
- Uh-huh.

236
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,596
- 别忘了一漂亮的弓
- 是的，举起这肩线
- And don't forget a pretty bow.
- Yes, and raise the shoulder line.

237
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,955
- 我们把它做成蓝色的
- 不，还是粉红色
- We'll make it blue.
- Oh, no, dear, pink.

238
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,871
- 但是--
- 当然，我们得需要少许褶
- But--
- Of course, we'll need a few pleats.

239
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,235
但是我们怎样让她离开这个房子?
Yes, but how are we gonna
get her out of the house?

240
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,356
我在考虑
Oh, I'll think of something.

241
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,069
你们三个一直在干什么?
Well, and what are
you three dears up to?

242
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,196
-什么?
- Up to?
- Up to?
- Up to?

243
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,157
Uh, uh-- Th-Th-The--
Cr-- Uh--

244
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,470
我们，我们--
Well, we-- Uh, we-- W-We--

245
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,348
- 我们想你去采些浆果
- 对，浆果！
- We want you to pick some berries.
- That's it, berries!

246
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,715
- 浆果?
- 很多浆果
- Berries?
- Lots of berries.

247
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,759
- 但我昨天已经采过浆果了
- 噢，我们还需要，亲爱的
- But I-I picked berries yesterday.
- Oh, w-we need more, dear.

248
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,752
- 很多，很多
- 是的!
- Lots, lots more.
- Yes!

249
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,078
- 别急着回来，亲爱的
- 但也别走太远了
- Now don't hurry back, dear.
- But don't go too far.

250
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,469
- 别和陌生人讲话
- 再见，亲爱的
- And don't speak to strangers.
- Goodbye, dear.

251
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,870
再见!
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

252
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,630
- 我想知道她是否怀疑了
- 当然没有
- I wonder if she suspects.
- Of course not.

253
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,917
来吧，她会惊喜的
Come on!
Oh, will she be surprised.

254
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,991
一个生日宴会
A real birthday party.

255
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,957
还有生日蛋糕
With a real birthday cake.

256
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,793
一件服装一位公主，够让我们骄傲了
Yes, and a dress
a princess can be proud of.

257
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,873
- 我去拿魔法棒
- 好的，噢，魔法棒？
- I'll get the wands.
- Yes, you can, uh-- The wands?

258
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,633
- 不要
- 不许用魔法！
- Oh, no!
- No magic!

259
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,995
但是16年马上就要过去了
But the sixteen years
are almost over.

260
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,150
我们要以防万一
We're taking no chances.

261
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,038
但我从未烤过奇特的蛋糕
But I've never baked
a fancy cake.

262
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,076
你不必烤那样的蛋糕，亲爱的
Oh, you won't have to, dear.

263
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,196
我去烤蛋糕
I'm going to bake the cake.

264
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,840
- 你?
- 她早就就想烤了
- You?
- Oh, she's always wanted to, dear.

265
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,229
- 这是她最后的机会
- And this is her last chance.
- Well--

266
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,949
我将要用粉红色和蓝色的勿忘我烤个15层的蛋糕
I'm going to make it fifteen layers
with pink and blue forget-me-nots.

267
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,349
我去做衣服
And I'm making the dress.

268
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,352
但你不会缝制，她也从未烤过蛋糕
But you can't sew,
and she's never cooked.

269
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,069
- 很简单！
- 照着这本书做就行了
- Oh-ho-ho, it's simple!
- All you do is follow the book.

270
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,835
站上来，亲爱的，你暂时做会模特
Up here, dear.
You can be the dummy.

271
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,276
该我说我们还是应该使用魔法
Well, I still say
we ought to use magic.

272
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,278
"面粉，三杯"
"Flour, three cups."

273
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,238
杯子，杯子，杯子...
Cups, cups, cups, cups,
cups, cups, cups.

274
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,039
噢
Oh.

275
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,157
一，二，三
One, two, three.

276
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,074
- 这用来干什么?
- 它在底部要有一个洞
- What's that for?
- Well, it's got to have
a hole in the bottom.

277
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,436
那是为了脚能穿过
That's for the feet
to go through.

278
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,716
- 它是粉色的
- 喔，可爱的图案，不是吗?
- It's pink.
- Oh, lovely shade, isn't it?

279
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,315
- 但我喜欢蓝色的
- 现在，亲爱的...
- But I wanted it blue.
- Now, dear...

280
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,516
我们决定粉色作为她的颜色
we decided
pink was her colour.

281
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,558
你说了算!
You decided!

282
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,828
"两个鸡蛋，逐渐的拌入"
"Two eggs. Fold in gently."

283
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,434
压碎？喔，好的
Fold? Uh, oh, well.

284
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,758
我不能呼吸了!
I can't breathe!

285
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,400
让我出去
Let me out of here.

286
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,516
- 看起来很可怕
- 那是因为穿在你身上，亲爱的
- It looks awful.
- That's because it's on you, dear.

287
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,876
"现在，一茶匙发酵粉"
"茶匙"?
"Now, yeast, one tsp."
"Tsp."?

288
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,110
一茶匙
One teaspoon.

289
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,078
- 当然，一茶匙
- 嗯!
- Oh, one teaspoon, of course!
- Hmm!

290
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,470
喔，那孩子长的真快
Oh, gracious,
how that child has grown.

291
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,757
好像我们昨天才带她来这似的
Oh, it seems only yesterday
we brought her here.

292
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,434
只是一个婴儿
Just a tiny baby.

293
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,994
- 怎么了，玛莉怀德
- 究竟怎么了，亲爱的?
- Why, Merryweather.
- What ever is the matter, dear?

294
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,469
过了今天，她就要成为一位公主了...
After today,
she'll be a princess...

295
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,279
我们不会再有布莱尔罗丝了
and we won't have
any Briar Rose.

296
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,555
- 噢，弗洛拉!
- 现在，现在...
- Oh, Flora!
- Now, now, now, now.

297
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,189
我们，我们都知道这一天迟早会到来
Well, we-- we all knew
this day had to come.

298
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,919
但为什么要来的这么快呢?
But why did it
have to come so soon?

299
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,879
毕竟，我们拥有她16年
After all, we've had her
for sixteen years.

300
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,269
美好的16年
Sixteen wonderful years.

301
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,870
我们的所做正如许多的傻子所为
Oh, gracious! We're acting
like a lot of ninnies.

302
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,714
快点，否则我们准备好之前她会回来的
Come on. She'll be back
before we get started.

303
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,473
你听见了吗，参森？
You hear that, Samson?

304
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,915
很动听
Beautiful.

305
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,030
谁在唱?
What is it?

306
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,556
来吧，我们去探个究竟
Come on.
Let's find out.

307
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,030
喔，别这样
额外的一桶燕麦？
Aw, come on.
For an extra bucket of oats?

308
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,710
再加一些胡萝卜?
And a few carrots?

309
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,075
驾!
Hup, boy!

310
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,794
Whoa!

311
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,550
别再想吃胡萝卜
No carrots.

312
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,397
我想知道
I wonder

313
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,756
我想知道
I wonder

314
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,958
我想知道为什么每只小鸟
I wonder why
each little bird

315
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,554
有某人
Has a someone

316
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,598
来歌唱那
To sing to

317
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,752
美好事物
Sweet things to

318
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,039
一首快活的小爱曲
A gay little love melody

319
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,476
我想知道
I wonder

320
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,313
我想知道
I wonder

321
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,870
如果我的心一直唱歌
Ifmy heart keeps singing

322
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,509
我的歌声会飞向
Will my song go winging

323
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,751
某人
To someone

324
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,230
一个会找到我的人
Who 'll find me

325
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:35,713
然后他也会对我唱情歌
And bring back a love song
To me

326
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,390
噢，亲爱的
Oh, dear.

327
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,155
为什么她们仍然把我看作是小孩呢?
Why do they still
treat me like a child?

328
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,510
谁?
Who?

329
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,559
弗洛拉，弗娜还有玛莉怀德阿姨
Aunt Flora and Fauna
and Merryweather.

330
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,398
她们从不让我接触任何人
They never want me
to meet anyone.

331
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,476
但是你知道吗?
But you know something?

332
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,676
我骗了她们
I fooled them.

333
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,274
我接触过某人
I have met someone.

334
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,078
谁?
Who?

335
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,069
谁? 谁?
Who? Who?

336
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,993
一位王子
Oh, a prince.

337
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,879
他高大英俊，还有--
Well, he's tall
and handsome and--

338
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,871
很浪漫
and so romantic.

339
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,076
我们一起散布一起聊天
Oh, we walk together
and talk together.

340
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,197
在我们说再见之前...
And just before
we say goodbye...

341
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,033
他拥抱我...
he takes me in his arms...

342
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,192
然后...
and then...

343
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,475
我醒来了
I wake up.

344
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,713
是的，这只是我的一个梦
Yes, it's only in my dreams.

345
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,395
但据说如果你反复梦见同一个梦...
But they say ifyou dream
a thing more than once...

346
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,516
它就一定会实现...
it's sure to come true...

347
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,876
我见过他多次
and I've seen him
so many times.

348
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,510
你知道，参森...
You know, Samson...

349
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,229
那声音有点怪异
there was something strange
about that voice.

350
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,756
简直是完美无暇
Too beautiful to be real.

351
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,833
或许是一些神秘的精灵，像树精或者--
Maybe it was some mysterious
being, a wood sprite or a--

352
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,755
放下！
Here, stop!

353
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,199
怎么回事，是我梦想中的王子
Why, it's my dream prince.

354
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,114
王子殿下
Your Highness.

355
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,717
我真的不允许对陌生人说话...
You know, I'm really not
supposed to speak to strangers...

356
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,075
但是我们以前见过
but we've met before.

357
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,549
我认识你
I knowyou

358
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,953
我曾经在梦境中和你一起散步
I walked with you
once upon a dream

359
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,554
我认识你
I knowyou

360
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,676
你的眼神
The gleam in your eyes

361
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,911
是如此熟悉的眼神
Is so familiar a gleam

362
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,356
但我知道是真实的
Yet I know it's true

363
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,991
那梦境是他们很少见到的
That visions
are seldom all they seem

364
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,469
但如果我认识你
But ifl knowyou

365
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,949
我知道你会做什么
I know what you'll do

366
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,112
你会立刻爱上我
You'll love me at once

367
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:25,311
在那个梦里你会这么做
The wayyou did
once upon a dream

368
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,154
但是如果我认识你
But ifl knowyou

369
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,038
我知道你会做什么
I know what you'll do

370
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,839
你会立刻爱上我
You'll love me at once

371
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,751
你会这么做
- The wayyou--
- The wayyou did

372
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,391
在那个梦里
Once upon a dream

373
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,149
噢! 噢!
Oh! Oh!

374
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,437
非常抱歉
我并不想吓到你
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

375
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,909
噢，不是这样的
Oh, it, uh, wasn't that.

376
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,594
不过你是一个--
It's just that you're a-- a--

377
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,796
- 陌生人?
- 嗯亨
- A stranger?
- Mm-hmm.

378
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,474
但你忘了? 我们以前见过
But don't you remember?
We've met before.

379
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,916
- 我们见过?
- 是的，当然，你自己说的
- We-- We have?
- Well, of course. You said so yourself.

380
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,797
曾经在一个梦里
Once upon a dream.

381
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,348
我认识你
I knowyou

382
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,958
我曾经在梦境中和你一起散步
I walked with you
once upon a dream

383
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,679
我认识你
I knowyou

384
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,517
你的眼神是如此的熟悉
The gleam in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam

385
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,789
我知道这是真实的
Yet I know it's true

386
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:39,432
那梦境是他们很少见到的
That visions
are seldom all they seem

387
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,796
但是如果我认识你
But ifl knowyou

388
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,519
我知道你会做什么
I know what you'll do

389
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,717
你会立刻爱上我
You'll love me at once

390
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,360
你所做的
The wayyou did

391
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:59,757
在那个梦里
Once upon a dream

392
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,236
你是谁?
Who are you?

393
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,515
你叫什么?
What's your name?

394
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,636
嗯？?
Hmm?

395
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,280
噢，我的名字
Oh, my name.

396
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,920
是--
Why, it's-- it's--

397
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,673
噢，不，不，我不能--
Oh, no, no, I can't! I--

398
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,910
- 再见!
- 我什么时候能再见到你?
- Goodbye!
- But when will I see you again?

399
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,515
- 不会了!不会再见！
- 不会再见?
- Oh, never! Never!
- Never?

400
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,229
- 或许有一天
- 什么时候？明天？
- Well, maybe someday.
- When? Tomorrow?

401
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,959
不！今晚！
Oh, no! This evening!

402
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,316
- 哪里?
- 幽谷的农舍里
- Where?
- At the cottage in the glen.

403
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,110
那里，噢!
There. Ooh!

404
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,717
- 这个蛋糕怎么样?
- 怎么回事，它--
- Well, what do you think of it?
- Why, it's--

405
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,758
一个与众不同的蛋糕，不是吗？
It's a very unusual cake,
isn't it?

406
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,833
是的。把它烤烤会变的更硬
Yes. Of course, it'll be
much stiffer after it's baked.

407
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,754
当然，亲爱的。嗯，你认为衣服怎么样?
Of course, dear. Um, what
do you think of the dress?

408
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,751
嗯，它--
Well, it's, uh--

409
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,276
看起来并没有书上那样漂亮，是吗?
I-It's not exactly the way
it is in the book, is it?

410
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,316
噢，我改进
Oh, I improved it.

411
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,757
不过，也许我可以加一些褶，啊，啊，你觉得怎么样？
But perhaps if I added a few more
ruffles, uh-- Uh, what do you think?

412
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,675
嗯，我同意。你觉得呢，玛莉怀德？
Um, I think so.
What do you think, Merryweather?

413
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,514
我觉得我们已经够多的废话了
I think we've had enough
of this nonsense!

414
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,991
我们应该考虑一下罗丝她会对这些怎么想。
I think we ought to think of Rose
and what she'll think of this mess.

415
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,548
我还是跟以前想的一样
I still think
what I thunk before.

416
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,074
我去拿魔法棒
I'm going to get those wands.

417
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,549
我认为，她是对的。
You know, I think she's right.

418
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,870
在这了，好像新的一样
Here they are, good as new.

419
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,953
小心！玛莉怀德
Ah, ah, ah!
C-C-C-C-C-Careful, Merryweather!

420
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,838
快，锁上门
Quick, lock the doors.

421
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:55,550
弗娜，你去关上窗
噢，堵上所有的漏缝
Uh, Fauna, you close the windows.
Oh, block up every cranny.

422
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,916
我们不能冒险
We can't take any chances.

423
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,434
现在你看着那些蛋糕
Now, you take care
of the cake.

424
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,795
在我清理房间的时候。
- While I--
- Clean the room, dear.

425
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,190
我会弄好衣服的。马上！
And I'll make the dress.
Now hurry!

426
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,271
噢
Ooh!

427
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,835
来吧，水桶，拖把，扫帚
Come on, bucket, mop, broom.

428
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,388
弗洛拉说要打扫房间。
Flora says clean up the room.

429
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,230
现在做一件漂亮的衣服...
And now to make
a lovely dress...

430
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,039
适合一位优雅高贵的公主
fit to grace a fair princess.

431
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,031
蛋，面粉，一点--
Eggs, flour, minute--

432
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,113
按照书里说的那样做，我会放上蜡烛
Just do it like it says here
in the book. I'll put on the candles.

433
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,517
噢，不会吧，不要粉红色的，蓝色吧
Oh, no, not pink.
Make it blue.

434
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,308
玛莉怀德，做成粉红色。
Merryweather!
Make it pink.

435
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,589
蓝色。
Make it blue.

436
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,591
噢，粉红色。
Oh, pink!

437
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,559
蓝色。
Blue.

438
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,357
噢，你看看你做了什么
Ohh, now look
what you've done!

439
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,960
嘘！听听
Shh, shh, shh! Listen.

440
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,749
- 是罗丝
- 她回来了。这些胡闹的事够了
- It's Rose.
- She's back. Enough
of this foolishness.

441
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,188
做成粉红色的。马上藏起来，快！
Make it pink.
Now hide, quick!

442
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,153
- 蓝色
- 弗洛拉！
- Blue.
- Aunt Flora!

443
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,036
啊，谁让拖把还在动的？
Good gracious!
Who left the mop running?

444
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,917
停下来，拖把
Stop, mop.

445
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,228
弗洛拉阿姨！弗娜！
Aunt Flora! Fauna!

446
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,629
玛莉怀德!
Merryweather!

447
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,553
人都去哪里了？噢！
Where is everybody? Oh!

448
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,870
惊喜！惊喜！
- Surprise! Surprise!
- Surprise! Surprise!
- Surprise!

449
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,997
- 生日快乐！
- 噢，亲爱的！
- Happy birthday!
- Oh, you darlings!

450
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,594
这是我一生中最快乐的一天！
This is the happiest day
of my life.

451
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,910
一切都是那么美好！
Everything's so wonderful.

452
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,992
- 等一下他！
- 他？
- Just wait 'til you meet him.
- Him?

453
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,914
- 罗丝！
- 你约了一个陌生人？
- Rose!
- Y-You've met some stranger?

454
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,231
他不是陌生人，我们以前认识的
Oh, he's not a stranger.
We've met before.

455
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,436
- 是吗？
- 哪里？
- You have?
- Where?

456
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,829
在一次梦里
Once upon a dream.

457
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,115
我认识你
I knowyou

458
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:57,911
我曾经在梦境中和你一起散步
I walked with you
once upon a dream

459
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,468
- 她恋爱了。
- 噢，不会吧。
- She's in love!
- Oh, no.

460
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,790
太可怕了
This is terrible.

461
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,997
为什么？毕竟，我十六岁了
Why? After all,
I am sixteen.

462
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,516
- 不是这样的，亲爱的
- 你已经订婚了
- It isn't that, dear.
- You're already betrothed.

463
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,194
- 订婚了？
- 就在你出生的时候。
- Betrothed?
- Since the day you were born.

464
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,068
- 嫁给菲利普王子
- 但是，这不可能的
- To Prince Phillip, dear.
- But that's impossible.

465
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,958
我怎么会嫁给一个王子？
我应该是......
How could I marry a prince?
I'd have to be--

466
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,429
- 一个公主
- 你是的，亲爱的。
- A princess.
- And you are, dear.

467
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,556
奥罗拉公主。
Princess Aurora.

468
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,269
今天晚上，我们会送你回到你的父亲斯蒂芬国王身边
Tonight, we're taking you back
to your father, King Stefan.

469
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,715
但是，我不能回去
But-- But I can't.

470
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,997
他今天晚上就会来，我答应在这见他了
He's coming here tonight.
I promised to meet him.

471
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,995
对不起，孩子，你以后不能再见那个年轻人
I'm sorry, child, but you must
never see that young man again.

472
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,958
噢，不，不！
Oh, no! No!

473
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,079
我无法相信！不，不！
I can't believe it! No! No!

474
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,552
我们以为她会很开心
And we thought
she'd be so happy.

475
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,032
还没见到她，休伯特
No sign of heryet, Hubert.

476
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,874
不会这么早
这会是日落前最美好的半个小时
'Course not. It's a good
half hour 'til sunset.

477
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,429
啊，漂亮的鸟儿
Ah, excellent bird.

478
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,315
噢，别这样，来吧。
Oh, now, come, man!

479
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,914
振作起来，战争结束了
Buck up! Battle's over!

480
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,911
像这里那样好的女孩
Girl's as good as here.

481
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,037
对不起，休伯特，但是16年来....
I'm sorry, Hubert,
but after sixteen years...

482
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,395
的忧虑，谁也不会知道--
ofworrying, never knowing--

483
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,119
过去了，一切都过去了
The past! All in the past.

484
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,316
今晚，我们为将来干杯...
Tonight, we toast
the future...

485
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,836
这是我收藏了16年的东西
with something I've been saving
for sixteen years.

486
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,108
来，为了未来！
Here. To the future!

487
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,668
对，休伯特，为了未来！
Right, Hubert.
To the future.

488
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,754
干！干！
- Skumps, skumps
- Skumps

489
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,310
- 为了今晚干杯！
- 未来很美好！
- A toast to this night
- The outlook is rosy

490
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,152
未来多么光明！
The future is bright

491
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:13,119
我们的孩子就要结婚
我们的国家就要统一
Our children will marry
Our kingdoms unite

492
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,589
干！干！
Skumps, skumps

493
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,148
干！
Skumps

494
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,069
啊，极品的珍藏
Ah, excel lent vi ntage.

495
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,516
- 现在，为了新的家庭干杯！嗯？
- 新家庭？
- And now, to the new home, eh?
- New home?

496
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,955
孩子们需要有他们自己的家，不是吗？
Children need a nest
of their own, what?

497
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,271
一个安置他们的窝，嗯？
Place to raise
their little brood, eh?

498
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,510
啊，我期待那一天
Well, I suppose in time--

499
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,114
当然了，为了新家庭！
Of course! To the home!

500
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,872
干！干！
- Skumps
- Skumps

501
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,032
- 为了新家庭干杯
- 我们要建造一座壮丽的宫殿
-A toast to the home
- One grander by far

502
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,997
比罗马宫殿还要壮丽的
Than a palace in Rome

503
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,868
我给你倒满，你杯子里全是泡沫
Uh, let me fill up your glass.
That glass was all foam.

504
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,349
干！
Skumps, skumps

505
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,670
干！
Skumps

506
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,628
这个计划！
The plans!

507
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,310
你觉得怎么样？当然，并不详细
Well, what do you think?
Nothing elaborate, of course.

508
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,109
40间卧室，餐厅，蜜月别墅
Forty bedrooms, dining hall.
Honeymoon cottage, really.

509
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,317
你的意思是，已经在建那座宫殿了？
You-- You mean, you're
building it already?

510
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,949
建好了！完成了！他们明天就能搬进去
Built, man! Finished!
Lovebirds can move in tomorrow.

511
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,318
明天？但是，休伯特，他们还没有结婚
Tomorrow? But, Hubert,
they're not even married yet.

512
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,119
今晚看好点，直到婚礼
Take care of that tonight.
To the wedding!

513
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,749
等一会儿，休伯特，我还没有见到我的女儿
Now hold on, Hubert. I haven't
even seen my daughteryet...

514
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,717
你就把她从我身边抢走了
and you're taking her
away from me.

515
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,030
- 你正在把菲利普带过来，是吗？
- 是的，不过
- Getting my Phillip, aren't you?
- Yes, but--

516
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,270
我们急着抱孙子，不是吗？
Want to see our grandchildren,
don't we?

517
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,874
- 当然，但是...
- 我们要抓紧时间
- Of course, but, uh--
- There's no time to lose.

518
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,157
我们年事已高
Getting on in years.

519
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,516
- 为了婚礼
- 现在，理智一点，休伯特
- To the wedding!
- Now, be reasonable, Hubert.

520
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,149
毕竟，奥罗拉根本不知道这一切
After all, Aurora knows
nothing about all this.

521
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:02,678
- 是吗？
- 嗯，也许会有些震惊
- Well?
- Well, it-- it may come
as quite a shock.

522
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,150
震惊？菲利普，会震惊吗？
Shock? My Phillip, a shock?

523
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,800
菲利普怎么了？
What's wrong
with my Phillip?

524
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,235
没什么，休伯特，我只是想说--
Nothing, Hubert.
I only meant--

525
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,312
你的女儿为什么不喜欢我的儿子？
Why doesn't your daughter
like my son?

526
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,358
- 现在.....
- 我不是很确定。
- Now, now--
- I'm not so sure...

527
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,079
我的儿子喜欢你的女儿！
my son likes your daughter!

528
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,470
- 现在，看这里
- 我不确定我的孙子....
- Now, see here.
- I'm not so sure my grandchildren...

529
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,869
喜欢你成为他的祖父！
want you for a grandfather!

530
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,554
为什么？你不可理喻.....
Why, you, you unreasonable...

531
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,712
- 啊？谁？啊。
- 虚伪，粗暴，多嘴的老家伙！
- Huh? Who? Uh--
- pompous, blustering, old windbag!

532
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,951
- 不可理喻，虚伪
- 小心，先生！
Unreasonable, pompous--
On guard, sir!

533
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,474
我警告你，休伯特，这会引起战争
I warn you, Hubert,
this means war.

534
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,597
前进！为了荣誉，为了王国！
Forward! For honour!
For country!

535
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,478
噢！噢！
Oh! Ohh!

536
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,075
- 嗨
- 可是，这是怎么了？
- Hey.
- What's this all about, anyway?

537
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,755
没有什么，休伯特！绝对没事！
No-- Nothing, Hubert.
Absolutely nothing!

538
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,354
呃，孩子们必须去相爱
Eh, children bound to fall
in love with each other.

539
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,671
正是，没错
而且，为了孙子
Yeah. Precisely.
And as for grandchildren...

540
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,469
我会马上让那群皇室的木雕家们明天开工
I'll have the royal woodcarvers
start work on the cradle tomorrow.

541
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,358
要豪华的！
极其壮丽，当然
Splendid!
King-size, of course.

542
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,432
当然
为了木雕家们
Certainly.
To the woodcarvers guild.

543
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:27,512
尊敬的，菲利普王子！
His Royal Highness,
Prince Phillip!

544
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,955
菲利普？
Phillip?

545
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,316
菲利普! 菲利普!
Phillip! Phillip!

546
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,391
菲利普！噢，菲利普！
Phillip! Ho, Phillip!

547
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,471
快点，孩子，快！
H-Hurry, boy, hurry!

548
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,516
啊，换身合适的衣服
Uh, change into
something suitable.

549
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,875
你不能穿成这样见你未来的新娘
Can't meetyour future bride
looking like that.

550
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,236
- 我已经见过她了，爸爸
- 是吗？你见过她？哪里？
- But I have met her, Father.
- Yeah-- You have? Where?

551
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,515
在一次梦里
Once upon a dream.

552
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:02,070
噢，别这样，菲利普！
别这样，哇，菲利普！
Oh, Phillip! Stop it!
Stop that! Wa-- Phillip!

553
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,991
菲利普，放下我！
Phi-- Put me down!

554
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,117
那好，这个梦说了些什么？
Now, what's all
this "dream" nonsense?

555
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,839
这不是梦，爸爸
我真的见过她了
It wasn't a dream, Father.
I really did meet her.

556
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,230
噢，奥罗拉公主？天啊，我们一定要告诉斯蒂芬
Oh, the Princess Aurora? Good
heavens, we must tell Stefan.

557
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,153
- 为什么？这真的很不可思议
- 可是，我没有说这是奥罗拉
-Why, this is the most amazing--
-I-I didn't say it was Aurora.

558
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,071
你一定有的，你说了
You most certainly did.
You-- You said--

559
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,391
我只是说我见到了我要娶的女孩，但我不知道她是谁
I said I met the girl I was going
to marry. I don't know who she was.

560
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,870
- 一个乡下女孩，我猜
- 一个乡下女孩？
- A peasant girl, I suppose.
- A-- A peasant g-girl?

561
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,030
你要娶一个...
You-- You're going
to marry a g--

562
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,032
怎么了？菲利普，你开玩笑吧
Why, Phillip, you're joking.

563
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,670
不是吗？
Isn't he?

564
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,911
噢，你不可以这样做。
Oh! Y-Y-You can't
do this to me.

565
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,755
为了她放弃王座，国家？
Give up the throne, the kingdom,
for some-- some nobody?

566
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,149
我不会让你这么做的
By Harry, I won't have it!

567
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,596
你是王子，你得娶公主！
You're a prince, and you're
going to marry a princess!

568
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,671
爸爸，你的思想还活在过去。
Now, Father,
you're living in the past.

569
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,716
这是14世纪了，现在--
This is the fourteenth century.
Nowadays--

570
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,032
现在，我还是国王，我命令你理智一点！
Nowadays I'm still the king! And I
command you to come to your senses!

571
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,951
- 我要娶我爱的女孩。
- 没错！
- And marry the girl I love.
- Exactly!

572
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,635
- 再见，爸爸
- 娶你爱的女孩...不行！不行！
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye, Father.
Marry the girl you-- No, no!

573
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,188
菲利普，站住，回来！
No, no, Phillip!
Stop! Come back!

574
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,430
噢，菲利普！
Oh, Phillip!

575
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,478
菲利普！
Phillip!

576
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,788
我该怎么跟斯蒂芬交待呢？
How-- How will I
ever tell Stefan?

577
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,035
我们现在进去
Come along now.

578
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,558
好的，就在这里，亲爱的
All right. In here, dear.

579
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,795
- 哦！
- 锁上门，玛莉怀德
- Oh!
- Bolt the door, Merryweather.

580
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,678
弗娜，拉上窗帘
Fauna, pull the drapes.

581
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:53,356
好了，亲爱的，你坐在这里
And now, dear,
ifyou'll just sit here.

582
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,797
这是给你最后的礼物，孩子....
This one last gift,
dear child, for thee...

583
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,792
皇室的象征：
the symbol of thy royalty:

584
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,395
一顶优雅和美丽的王冠
a crown to wear
in grace and beauty...

585
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,438
代表了你的权力和皇室的责任
as is thy right
and royal duty.

586
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,831
- 现在，亲爱的
- 来吧
- Now, dear--
- Come.

587
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,551
让她单独呆一会儿
Let her have
a few moments alone.

588
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,790
这就是她见到的男孩
It's that boy she met.

589
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,518
我们该怎么做？
What ever are we going to do?

590
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:08,514
噢！我不明白为什么她一定要嫁给那些老王子
Ohh! I don't see why she
has to marry any old prince.

591
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,717
亲爱的，这不是我们能决定的
Now, that's not for us
to decide, dear.

592
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,230
也许，我们应该把这些告诉斯蒂芬国王
Maybe we should tell King Stefan
about the boy.

593
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,073
- 我们为什么不这样做呢？
- 听！
- Well, why don't we?
- Listen!

594
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,310
不好，是巫婆！罗丝
Maleficent! Rose!

595
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,277
- 罗丝!
- 罗丝!
- Rose!
- Rose!

596
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,318
- 噢，我们怎么能留下她一个人？
- 不！ 罗丝！
-Oh, why did we leave her alone?
-No! No!
-Rose!

597
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,231
罗丝！
Rose!

599
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,230

600
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,788
你在哪?
Where are you?

601
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:13,074
罗丝！罗丝！罗丝！
Rose! Rose! Rose!

602
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,513
- 罗丝！罗丝！
- 罗丝！
- Rose! Rose!
- Rose!

603
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,275
- 罗丝！
- Rose!
- Rose!
- Rose!

604
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,475
- 罗丝！
- 别碰任何东西!
- Rose!
- Rose!
- Don't touch anything!

605
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,516
任何东西!任何东西!
Anything! Anything!

606
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,354
碰那个锭子
我说，碰它！
Touch the spindle.
Touch it, I say.

607
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,756
可怜的人，白痴们...
You poor, simple fools...

608
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,592
还想着你们能够击败我呢
thinking you could defeat me.

609
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,956
我，万恶的主人
Me, the mistress of all evil!

610
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:18,029
这就是你们高贵的公主
Well, here's your
precious princess.

611
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,350
- 罗丝!
- 噢，罗丝!
- Rose!
- Oh, Rose!

612
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:32,230
噢，我不会原谅自己的
Oh, I'll never
forgive myself.

613
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,039
这是我们的过失
We're all to blame.

614
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:47,029
斯蒂芬，有，有一件重要的事我必须要告诉你
Stefan, th-there's-- there's something
important I have to tell you.

615
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,997
等会再说，休伯特
Uh, not now, Hubert.

616
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,071
但，但这是关于菲利普的
But-- But it's a-about Phillip.

617
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,197
菲利普？噢，是的，菲利普
Phillip? Oh, yes,
of course, Phillip.

618
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,068
- 那个孩子呢?
- 那就是我将要跟你说的
- Why, where is the boy?
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

619
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,077
- 立即召他来
- 但是--
-Well, send for him immediately.
-But--

620
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,151
嘘！
Shh!

621
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,030
太阳下山了
The sun has set.

622
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:09,317
准备好迎接你的公主
Make ready to welcome
your princess.

623
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,236
可怜的斯蒂芬国王和王后
Poor King Stefan and the queen.

624
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,073
他们发现了会很伤心
They'll be heartbroken
when they find out.

625
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,518
- 不会的

- They're not going to.
- They aren't?

626
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,559
- 但是...
- 我会让他们都沉睡，直到罗斯醒来
- But--
- We'll put them all to sleep
until Rose awakens.

627
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,950
来吧
Come.

628
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:46,270
睡美人！

在你的头发里
In your hair

00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,112
性感的嘴唇

00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,829
红色，红色的玫瑰
The red, red rose

00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,512
做着真爱的梦

634
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:13,277
在沉睡
In slumber repose

635
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:17,319
有一天
One day

636

他会来到

在黎明到来的时候
Riding out ofthe dawn

638
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,598
你就会醒来
Andyou'll awaken

00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:37,390
得到第一次爱的吻
To love's first kiss

640
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,755
到那时候，
'Til then

649
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,676
好像他爱上了一个乡下的女孩
Seems he's fallen in love
with some-- peasant girl.

650
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,194
乡下女孩？
Peasant girl?

651
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,397
是的
Yes? Yes?

652
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,278
乡下女孩？是谁？他在哪里s到的？
The peasant girl? Who is she?
Where did he meet her?

653
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,989
啊，就是他s到的乡下女孩--
Uh, just some
peasant girl he met--

654
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,911
哪里？哪里？
Where? Where?

655
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,834
在一次梦里
Once upon a dream.

656
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,754
梦里....
罗丝！菲利普王子！
Once upon a dre--
Rose! Prince Phillip!

657
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,400
噢！
Oh! Oh!

658
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:55,279
快点，我们必须回到村舍里
Come on. We've got to
get back to the cottage.

659
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,956
进来吧。
Come in.

660
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,350
哇！
Well!

661
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,716
这礼物真令人惊喜。
This is a pleasant surprise.

662
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:20,349
我设下了陷阱来抓农民，
I set my trap for a peasant,
and lo...

663
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,476
却抓到了王子
I catch a prince.

664
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,511
带他走
Away with him.

665
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,637
但是温柔一点，宝贝，轻点
But gently, my pets.
Gently.

666
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,797
我有新计划了
I have plans
for our royal guest.

667
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,079
巫婆！
- Maleficent!
- Maleficent!
- Maleficent!

668
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,754
她抓走了菲利普王子！
She's got Prince Phillip!

669
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,638
在禁山上
At the Forbidden Mountain.

670
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,109
但是，我们不能去那
But we can't--
we can't go there.

671
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,958
可以的，而且必须去
We can, and we must!

672
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,358
可惜菲利普王子不在这....
What a pity Prince Phillip
can't be here...

673
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,113
参加不了庆典
to enjoy the celebration.

674
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:47,834
来吧，我们去地牢里跟他干杯
Come. We must go to the dungeon
and cheer him up.

675
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,475
噢，来吧，菲利普王子
Oh, come now, Prince Phillip.

676
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,199
怎么那么忧郁？
Why so melancholy?

677
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,431
一个美好的未来就在你的面前
A wondrous future
lies before you.

678
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,273
你，就是那个英雄...
You, the destined hero...

679
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:54,477
一个迷人的童话故事里的英雄
of a charming fairy tale
come true.

680
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,668
看，斯蒂芬国王的城堡。
Behold, King Stefan's castle.

681
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,274
在那边的塔顶上....
And in yonder topmost tower...

682
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,920
正在梦见她的真爱....
dreaming of her true love...

683
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,798
奥罗拉公主
the Princess Aurora.

684
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,117
但是看见了奇怪的命运
But see the gracious
whim of fate.

685
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,397
为什么，是一模一样的乡下女孩...
Why, 'tis the selfsame
peasant maid...

686
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,234
就是她昨天得到了我们王子的心
who won the heart of
our noble prince but yesterday.

687
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:29,153
她真的是一位很美丽的女孩...
She is indeed
most wondrous fair...

688
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,033
头发里有夕阳的金色光芒....
gold of sunshine
in her hair...

689
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:37,352
有红玫瑰的嘴唇
Iips that shame
the red, red rose.

690
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,513
沉睡了很久，她终于发现了依靠
In ageless sleep,
she finds repose.

691
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,194
时光匆匆的过去
The years roll by.

692
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:51,115
但是，几百年对一颗坚定的心来说就像只有一天
But a hundred years to
a steadfast heart are but a day.

693
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,829
现在，地牢的大门....
And now, the gates
of a dungeon part...

694
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:59,357
已经开了，我们的王子也可以出发了
and our prince
is free to go his way.

695
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,274
骑上他的马
Off he rides
on his noble steed--

696
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:07,512
一个勇敢的高大的身躯，
a valiant figure,
straight and tall--

697
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,716
将要唤醒他的爱....
to wake his love...

698
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,076
献出第一次爱的吻....
with love's first kiss...

699
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:18,154
他将证明真爱会战胜一切！
and prove that true love
conquers all!

700
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,079
为什么，你，你--
Why, you, you, y--

701
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,955
来吧，宝贝，我们离开高贵的公主...
Come, my pet. Let us leave
our noble prince...

702
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,316
随着这些愉快的想法
with these happy thoughts.

703
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,832
这是最快乐的一天
A most gratifying day.

704
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:48,437
16年来第一次...
For the first time
in sixteen years...

705
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:51,557
我会睡的很香
I shall sleep well.

706
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,028
没有时间解释了
Shh! No time to explain.

707
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,239
等等，菲利普王子，真爱之路...
Wait, Prince Phillip.
The road to true love...

708
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:23,232
可能仍然被很多的危险阻碍...
may be barred by still
many more dangers...

709
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,436
你必须自己单独去面对
which you alone
will have to face.

710
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:30,150
因此你要装备这块坚固的魔法盾牌...
So arm thyselfwith this
enchanted shield ofvirtue...

711
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,357
和这把锋利的真理之剑...
and this mighty
sword of truth...

712
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,513
用这些正义的武器将战胜邪恶
for these weapons of righteousness
will triumph over evil.

713
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,160
现在，我们得抓紧时间
Now, come. We must hurry.

714
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,396
菲利普，当心！
Phillip, watch out!

715
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:25,599
安静！你，告诉那些愚蠢的人--
Silence! You, tell
those fools to--

716
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,956
不！不！
No! No!

717
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:35,357
小心，菲利普！
Watch out, Phillip!

718
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,957
快点！快点，菲利普！
Hurry! Hurry, Phillip!

719
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:59,755
荆棘满布的森林将是他的坟墓...
A forest of thorns
shall be his tomb...

720
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:03,150
布满毁灭的雾穿过天空忍受!
borne through the skies
on a fog of doom!

721
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:06,596
现在，伴随着诅咒，一切都在我掌握之中
Now go with a curse
and serve me well.

722
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:10,309
斯蒂芬的城堡周围布满我的符咒
'Round Stefan's castle
cast my spell.

723
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,714
不！这不可能！
No! It cannot be!

724
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:11,068
现在你要面对的是我，王子...
Now shall you deal
with me, O Prince...

725
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,754
地狱的全部力量!
and all the powers of hell!

726
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,668
上来，沿着这上来!
Up! Up this way!

727
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,439
现在，真理之剑，飞跃雨燕...
Now, sword of truth,
fly swift and sure...

728
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,876
确信邪恶灭亡，真理永存！
that evil die
and good endure!

729
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,031
啊--噢，噢
Ehhh-- Oh, oh, uh--

730
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:05,033
原谅我，休伯特。葡萄酒，现在，嗯--
Forgive me, Hubert.
Ehh, uh, the wine. Now, uh--

731
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,997
g你，在说话吗?
You, uh, were saying?

732
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:10,834
啊? 我在说吗？ 噢，噢，是的
Huh? I-I was?
Oh! Oh, yes.

733
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:15,471
毕竟，斯蒂芬，这是十四世纪
Well, after all, Stefan,
this is the fourteenth century.

734
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,677
是的，你，你刚才已经说过了
Yes. You, uh, you said that
a moment ago.

735
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,672
回到刚才的主题...
Well, to come
right to the point...

736
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,433
我儿子菲利普说他要结婚，和--
my son Phillip says
he's going to marry--

737
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,833
是奥罗拉!她在这！
It's Aurora! She's here!

738
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,753
还有菲利普!
A-And-And-And Phillip!

739
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:15,038
这是怎么回事，孩子?
Wh-- What does this mean, boy?

740
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,759
我不明白--
I-I don't under--

741
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:23,159
但，但是--
B-Bu-- But-But, uh--

742
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,348
我，我不明白
I-I don't understand.

743
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,718
怎么了，弗娜，亲爱的?
Why, Fauna,
what's the matter, dear?

744
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:01,429
噢，我只是替这个结局高兴
Oh, I just love
happy endings.

745
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,229
是的，我也是--
Yes, I do too-- t--

746
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:07,470
蓝色!
Blue!

747
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,428
- 粉色
- 我认识你
- Pink.
- I knowyou

748
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:19,594
- 我曾经在梦境中和你一起散步
- 蓝色
- I walked with you once upon a dream
- Blue.

749
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:22,114
我认识你
I knowyou

750
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,077
你的眼神
The gleam in your eyes

751
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:27,277
是如此的熟悉
Is so familiar a gleam

752
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,193
但我知道是真实的
Yet I know it's true

753
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:34,876
那梦境是他们很少见到的
That visions are seldom
all they seem

754
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,235
但是如果我认识你
But ifl knowyou

755
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,356
我知道你会怎么做
I know what you'll do

756
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,351
你会立刻爱上我
You'll love me at once

757
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,431
你会这么做
The wayyou did once

758
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,954
在那个
Upon

759
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:54,197
梦里
A dream

760
