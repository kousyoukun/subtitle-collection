1
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:36,064
As in every stone of this size,
there is a flaw.

2
00:00:36,141 --> 00:00:39,702
- A flaw?
- The slightest flaw, Your Excellency.

3
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:41,712
If you look deep into the stone...

4
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,839
you will perceive
the tiniest discoloration.

5
00:00:44,682 --> 00:00:47,014
It resembles an animal.

6
00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:49,815
- An animal?
- A leaping panther.

7
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:54,055
Yes. A pink panther.

8
00:00:58,096 --> 00:01:00,030
Come here, Dala.

9
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,232
A gift to your father
from his grateful people.

10
00:01:08,306 --> 00:01:10,536
Someday it will be yours.

11
00:01:10,608 --> 00:01:13,076
The most fabulous diamond
in all the world.

12
00:01:13,144 --> 00:01:15,078
Come closer.

13
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:07,390
Okay. Thanks a lot, fellas.

14
00:07:07,465 --> 00:07:09,399
Don't forget
to take the wardrobe back.

15
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:11,401
How do you want them,
matte or glossy?

16
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:13,403
I want it right away.
I'm in a hurry.

17
00:07:13,471 --> 00:07:15,962
You can't rush a genius.

18
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,031
I'll rush.

19
00:07:18,109 --> 00:07:20,441
Now, don't forget
about the wardrobe.

20
00:07:27,752 --> 00:07:29,185
What you doing?

21
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:33,156
Where is everybody?

22
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:40,457
- Hey, you, come out of there!.
- Who is it?

23
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:42,658
Come out of there,
or we'll bust the door in!

24
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:44,667
Just a minute.

25
00:07:46,037 --> 00:07:48,062
- Can I help you?
- Where is he?

26
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:50,130
- Where's who?
- You know who. George Lytton.

27
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,405
He owes me 40 grand,
and nobody welshes on Big Joe.

28
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:56,447
Now, look, Big Joe,
I'm not a bill collector.

29
00:07:56,514 --> 00:07:59,142
I'm a photographer.
Just took his picture.

30
00:07:59,217 --> 00:08:01,651
- What kind of a picture?
- Graduation picture.

31
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:03,653
- His what?
- Graduation.

32
00:08:03,721 --> 00:08:05,348
Get him!

33
00:08:45,863 --> 00:08:48,525
They're worth half a million.
We'll settle for 300,000.

34
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:52,763
I'll do what I can, but
the merchandise is extremely hot.

35
00:09:13,224 --> 00:09:15,692
You stay here.
Come with me.

36
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:30,172
Come on!

37
00:09:54,432 --> 00:09:57,162
- Pardon, madame.
- Certainly.

38
00:09:57,234 --> 00:09:59,327
She's gone down.
Come on!

39
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:28,092
We must find that woman.

40
00:10:31,168 --> 00:10:34,626
- What was that? What'd you say?
- We don't have much of a description.

41
00:10:34,705 --> 00:10:39,642
About 5'7"",black hair,
wearing a light beige coat.

42
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,907
And the fools let that fence escape.
He might have talked.

43
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,107
- We will catch him.
- We must.

44
00:10:45,182 --> 00:10:49,585
We must find that woman. She is our
first positive link with the Phantom.

45
00:10:52,857 --> 00:10:55,690
- Yes?
- Your wife to see you, lnspector.

46
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,854
Send her in, please.
All right, Henri, that will be all.

47
00:11:04,502 --> 00:11:07,096
- Hello, my darling.
- My angel.

48
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:00,955
Amber, how are you?

49
00:12:13,304 --> 00:12:15,636
Hello, Duchess.
So glad you could come.

50
00:12:15,706 --> 00:12:18,436
Have fun, children.
Hello. How are you?

51
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:22,411
- Hello, darling!
- You ever met Monica?

52
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,176
Oh,but of course.
You were stunning in your last film.

53
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:30,379
- What's he say?
- He says hello...

54
00:12:30,454 --> 00:12:32,422
and he would like you
to meet his cousin.

55
00:12:35,025 --> 00:12:38,290
- His third cousin.
- Oh, well, that makes a difference.

56
00:12:44,835 --> 00:12:47,497
- Who's that?
- Princess Dala.

57
00:12:47,571 --> 00:12:50,096
Oh! Excuse me.

58
00:13:05,022 --> 00:13:06,455
Yes?

59
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:10,460
Miss Angela Dunning.

60
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:17,429
- Yes?
- Your Highness?

61
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:19,196
Yes.

62
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,670
Well, here I am again,
Your Highness.

63
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:24,708
I was just having a cocktail party,
and I saw you driving by.

64
00:13:27,178 --> 00:13:31,114
I just know you'd enjoy it.
Yes, you'd just love it--

65
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,894
Your Highness.

66
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,357
Hello there.

67
00:13:48,432 --> 00:13:50,992
I can't tell you
what an honor this is.

68
00:13:51,068 --> 00:13:53,559
Everyone's just dying to meet you.

69
00:15:09,813 --> 00:15:11,747
- Good morning, Your Highness.
- Good morning.

70
00:15:11,815 --> 00:15:14,375
- You're a wonderful skier.
- Thank you.

71
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:17,318
Help! Help!

72
00:15:17,388 --> 00:15:21,654
Somebody's taking my sleigh.
Amber! My dog.

73
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,355
Leave this to me, ma'am.

74
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:34,304
- What happened?
- I don't know.

75
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:38,239
Suddenly there was a man with a gun,
and he took the sleigh and Amber.

76
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:50,819
We'll only be here
for a few days, my darling.

77
00:15:50,888 --> 00:15:53,982
It's going to be a wonderful chance
for a beautiful vacation.

78
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,955
Excuse me. I'm--
My leg is caught.

79
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:01,429
I apologize
for this inconvenience.

80
00:16:02,766 --> 00:16:06,031
Do you know who that was?
That was Sir Charles Lytton.

81
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:08,071
- Really?
- Yes.

82
00:16:08,138 --> 00:16:11,733
Oh, I am lnspector Clouseau.
This is Madame Clouseau.

83
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,914
All right. Thank you.

84
00:16:21,118 --> 00:16:23,609
Oh, I'm sorry, my darling.

85
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:27,453
- It's all right, my darling.
- Excuse me, please.

86
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:30,857
-Do you know that you're really amazing?
-So you've said.

87
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,630
How you can manage
on a police inspector's salary.

88
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:38,463
How many women could save
enough out of their housekeeping...

89
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:41,197
to buy such a beautiful
mink coat as this?

90
00:16:41,271 --> 00:16:43,205
Well, it's not easy.

91
00:16:43,273 --> 00:16:45,741
You are a constant
and desirable contradiction.

92
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:48,403
Oh, I'm simply
a woman in love, my darling.

93
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:50,071
My darling.

94
00:16:56,053 --> 00:16:59,079
I'm sorry, my darling.
Please excuse me.

95
00:16:59,156 --> 00:17:01,181
It's perfectly all right.

96
00:17:01,258 --> 00:17:03,726
Oh, did I hurt you?
Are you all right?

97
00:17:03,794 --> 00:17:05,523
- Yes, I'm fine.
- You sure?

98
00:17:05,596 --> 00:17:08,292
- Yes, I am.
- My darling, I'm so sorry.

99
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:13,764
Darling, I have a little business
to conclude with the manager.

100
00:17:13,837 --> 00:17:15,270
Yes?

101
00:17:17,074 --> 00:17:20,134
After which, I'll return
to you immediately.

102
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,144
Bye, darling.

103
00:17:36,326 --> 00:17:38,260
It's all right.

104
00:18:06,623 --> 00:18:08,921
- How did it go?
- Perfectly.

105
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:18,533
Come in.

106
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:28,169
Her Highness Princess Dala
is concerned about your injuries.

107
00:18:28,245 --> 00:18:30,179
Oh, well, please
thank the princess...

108
00:18:30,247 --> 00:18:32,238
and tell her that there's
nothing to be concerned about.

109
00:18:32,316 --> 00:18:34,250
It's really not too serious.

110
00:18:34,318 --> 00:18:36,650
In that case, Her Highness
has instructed me...

111
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,655
to invite you for dinner
this evening, 8:00 at her chalet.

112
00:18:39,723 --> 00:18:42,453
Thank the princess.
I'd be delighted to come.

113
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:57,496
I understand you already know
Signor Tucker from Lloyds of London.

114
00:18:57,574 --> 00:18:59,201
- Hello again.
- Hello, old bean.

115
00:18:59,276 --> 00:19:02,143
- Your company insures the Pink Panther.
- Yes, for half a million.

116
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:03,941
- Pounds?
- Sterling.

117
00:19:04,014 --> 00:19:06,209
The Phantom could not resist
such a prize as the Pink Panther.

118
00:19:06,283 --> 00:19:08,308
He will most certainly
make an attempt.

119
00:19:08,385 --> 00:19:11,115
But when he does, I shall
be waiting for him. Excuse me.

120
00:19:11,188 --> 00:19:14,521
If I understand your theory, the
Phantom is one of Miss Dunning's guests.

121
00:19:14,591 --> 00:19:16,786
That is the theory, yes.
I would like to have from you...

122
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,727
the names of those guests
and the location of their rooms.

123
00:19:19,796 --> 00:19:21,730
Of course!

124
00:19:21,798 --> 00:19:24,392
I assume that the Princess Dala
has the jewel with her.

125
00:19:24,468 --> 00:19:26,459
She'd only tell me
it was in a safe place.

126
00:19:26,537 --> 00:19:29,438
I suppose if it isn't here,
it's at her villa in Rome.

127
00:19:29,506 --> 00:19:31,440
My men are watching that villa.

128
00:19:31,508 --> 00:19:34,443
With such foresight and planning,
how can the Phantom succeed?

129
00:19:34,511 --> 00:19:37,571
With such foresight and planning,
he's already succeeded for 20 years.

130
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:41,049
It's a mistake to underestimate him,
as the inspector can tell you.

131
00:19:41,118 --> 00:19:44,053
The shrewdest, cleverest, most ingenious
criminal in all the world.

132
00:19:44,121 --> 00:19:47,022
- And you have never even seen him?
- Well, I've seen him once.

133
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,321
Five years ago,
I got a fleeting glimpse--

134
00:19:50,394 --> 00:19:51,884
Excuse me.

135
00:19:51,962 --> 00:19:54,192
Got a fleeting glimpse of him
as he made his getaway.

136
00:19:54,264 --> 00:19:56,425
In a strange way,
I also admire that man.

137
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,402
He has-- how would you say--
a unique flair for the dramatic.

138
00:20:01,672 --> 00:20:05,768
- He actually waved good-bye to me.
- Fascinating.

139
00:20:05,842 --> 00:20:10,040
But this time, gentlemen,
I shall be waving good-bye to him...

140
00:20:10,113 --> 00:20:12,047
on his way to prison.

141
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:16,886
Good evening.

142
00:20:19,256 --> 00:20:20,848
- Thank you.
- Make yourself comfortable.

143
00:20:20,924 --> 00:20:23,518
Her Highness will join you in a moment.
May I give you a drink?

144
00:20:23,594 --> 00:20:26,028
Oh, I'd like a brandy,
thank you.

145
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:44,041
- Oh, Your Highness.
- Good evening, Sir Charles.

146
00:20:44,114 --> 00:20:47,208
Any news from the police
about your dear little dog?

147
00:20:47,284 --> 00:20:49,479
They expect I'll receive
a ransom note.

148
00:20:49,553 --> 00:20:52,488
I want you to know I am deeply grateful
for what you tried to do.

149
00:20:52,556 --> 00:20:55,320
Ma'am, it was nothing.

150
00:20:55,392 --> 00:20:57,019
Thank you.

151
00:20:57,094 --> 00:20:59,528
- Please sit down.
- Aren't you drinking?

152
00:20:59,596 --> 00:21:02,497
- I don't drink.
- Not ever?

153
00:21:02,566 --> 00:21:07,128
I'm quite content with reality.
I have no need for escape.

154
00:21:07,204 --> 00:21:10,435
I enjoy reality as much as the next man,
but in my case, fortunately...

155
00:21:10,507 --> 00:21:13,499
reality includes a good,
stiff belt every now and then.

156
00:21:13,577 --> 00:21:16,944
- On the other hand, I don't smoke.
- You're right. It's a nasty habit.

157
00:21:17,014 --> 00:21:20,245
Here's to all those nasty little habits
that we hold so dear.

158
00:21:21,318 --> 00:21:23,252
I beg your pardon?

159
00:21:24,788 --> 00:21:26,983
Well, let's just say
in this case it means...

160
00:21:27,057 --> 00:21:29,855
your health and thank you
for inviting me to dinner.

161
00:21:29,926 --> 00:21:33,919
It's not often I have the chance
to dine alone with a beautiful princess.

162
00:21:33,997 --> 00:21:38,195
I hate to disappoint you, Sir Charles,
but I'm afraid this isn't the night.

163
00:21:39,403 --> 00:21:42,930
- But I understood that--
- We're having dinner,but not alone.

164
00:21:51,448 --> 00:21:56,112
At last! Hello! We've been through
icicles up to our you-know-whats!

165
00:21:56,186 --> 00:21:58,245
Oh, Your Highness!

166
00:21:58,322 --> 00:22:02,725
I think it's just too darling of you
to invite me here tonight.

167
00:22:02,793 --> 00:22:05,557
- You've just made Cortina for me.
- Hello, lover.

168
00:22:05,629 --> 00:22:10,965
Oh, hello, dear boy.
Now, don't you move a muscle, darling.

169
00:22:11,034 --> 00:22:15,869
Isn't he wonderful, Your Highness?
Such a magnificent sacrifice.

170
00:22:19,943 --> 00:22:21,877
Good evening, sir.

171
00:22:52,776 --> 00:22:55,768
- May I have a cigarette, my darling?
- Yes, of course, my darling.

172
00:22:57,314 --> 00:22:59,646
- There you are, my love.
- Thank you.

173
00:23:02,252 --> 00:23:04,618
- Yes, sir?
- Scotch on the rocks.

174
00:23:08,825 --> 00:23:11,419
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

175
00:23:11,495 --> 00:23:13,895
Thank you very much.

176
00:23:13,964 --> 00:23:17,559
Say, I'm looking for my uncle,
Sir Charles Lytton.

177
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:21,364
- Darling.
- May I get you some water?

178
00:23:23,073 --> 00:23:27,032
- Hold your hands over your head.
- Yes, my darling. Bend forward.

179
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:30,238
- Oh, darling, I'm sorry.
- Are you all right?

180
00:23:30,313 --> 00:23:32,679
Are you all right, my darling?

181
00:23:32,749 --> 00:23:34,273
What?

182
00:23:34,351 --> 00:23:36,512
- My darling?
- I'll be right back.

183
00:23:36,586 --> 00:23:38,554
Yes, darling.

184
00:23:48,331 --> 00:23:49,923
Please.

185
00:23:57,174 --> 00:24:02,043
Yes, she's got a cough
in her throat, you know.

186
00:24:08,351 --> 00:24:12,310
And what do you think?
She turned out to be a man!

187
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:14,550
It's true! It's quite true!

188
00:24:14,624 --> 00:24:17,787
You know, Your Highness, you really
must let me give you a party.

189
00:24:17,861 --> 00:24:21,888
And I can positively guarantee
it'll be a party to end all parties.

190
00:24:21,965 --> 00:24:24,525
- I'm sure it will.
- Perhaps Her Highness has other plans.

191
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:28,697
On the contrary. Sounds like fun.
Will you include Sir Charles?

192
00:24:29,473 --> 00:24:34,069
Oh, no. Charles is having a fling
in Capri. He has his own parties.

193
00:24:34,144 --> 00:24:36,612
Yes, I've read about
some of his parties.

194
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,308
They're wonderful.
We call him the juggler.

195
00:24:39,382 --> 00:24:41,509
I've never really known
a man like him.

196
00:24:41,585 --> 00:24:45,316
He can keep ten girls in the air at once
and make each one happy.

197
00:24:45,388 --> 00:24:48,323
Amazing. Sort of
a contemporary Don Juan.

198
00:24:48,391 --> 00:24:50,552
- That's it.
- Ah,but there's a difference.

199
00:24:50,627 --> 00:24:54,154
Sir Charles' predecessor was forced
to climb balconies and fight duels...

200
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:57,257
and, as I understand it,
keep his women separate and apart.

201
00:24:58,201 --> 00:25:01,034
Now, Charles, on the other hand,
drives a Ferrari...

202
00:25:01,104 --> 00:25:04,005
enters with a key
and resorts to collective bargaining.

203
00:25:05,575 --> 00:25:07,509
But they both have
something in common.

204
00:25:07,577 --> 00:25:11,274
- And what's that, Your Highness?
- Maybe it's best forgotten.

205
00:25:11,348 --> 00:25:13,407
Oh, don't be silly.
Charles doesn't mind.

206
00:25:13,483 --> 00:25:17,180
- Everyone takes a potshot at Charles.
- Go ahead, ma'am, shoot.

207
00:25:17,254 --> 00:25:20,621
Well, it seems to me,
any middle-aged bachelor...

208
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:24,182
who has never desired
the basic rewards of wife and family...

209
00:25:24,261 --> 00:25:27,719
and finds it necessary to occupy
the major portion of his life...

210
00:25:27,797 --> 00:25:29,731
making one conquest after another...

211
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:33,360
is trying to prove something
that he can never possibly prove.

212
00:25:33,436 --> 00:25:35,529
- And what's that?
- That he's a man.

213
00:25:35,605 --> 00:25:37,835
- What?
- Oh, you're joking!

214
00:25:37,908 --> 00:25:40,809
It's somewhat complicated,
but basically sound.

215
00:25:40,877 --> 00:25:43,573
- Well, Charles?
- Not very original.

216
00:25:43,647 --> 00:25:46,639
That particular theory has become
rather a tired Freudian cliche.

217
00:25:46,716 --> 00:25:50,015
- But true.
- I've never been on the couch.

218
00:25:50,086 --> 00:25:52,520
Not true.
That's part of your problem.

219
00:25:54,624 --> 00:25:57,991
How refreshing to find royalty
possessed of such a perceptive wit.

220
00:25:58,061 --> 00:26:00,859
Well, Charles, you going
to take that lying down?

221
00:26:00,931 --> 00:26:04,230
Yes, as a matter of fact.
Ma'am, my leg is hurting rather badly.

222
00:26:04,301 --> 00:26:06,235
May I be excused?

223
00:26:08,505 --> 00:26:11,804
- Well, I'll be damned.
- I can't believe it.

224
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:14,105
- The leg?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

225
00:26:14,177 --> 00:26:18,477
Well, that just goes to prove
there's a first time for everything.

226
00:26:18,548 --> 00:26:19,981
Got a terrific laugh anyway.

227
00:26:27,924 --> 00:26:29,357
Simone!

228
00:27:39,162 --> 00:27:42,359
Jacques, I'm still cold.

229
00:27:42,432 --> 00:27:45,128
Perhaps another blanket,
my darling.

230
00:27:45,201 --> 00:27:47,396
Yes, all right, darling.

231
00:28:23,273 --> 00:28:25,434
There you are, my darling.

232
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:31,513
- Yes, darling?
- The light.

233
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:54,667
- What?
- I'm sorry, darling. It doesn't help.

234
00:28:57,107 --> 00:29:00,634
Perhaps a hot glass of milk.

235
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:05,010
But I think the room service
has finished, my love.

236
00:29:05,081 --> 00:29:07,379
Oh, yes, of course.
I forgot.

237
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:11,409
You see?
They're all gone now.

238
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:14,423
Oh, well. No matter.

239
00:29:16,893 --> 00:29:18,827
Well, you see...

240
00:29:20,864 --> 00:29:24,800
if my little pigeon
wants a glass of milk...

241
00:29:24,868 --> 00:29:26,802
she shall have one...

242
00:29:28,671 --> 00:29:32,402
even if I have to force them
to open the kitchen.

243
00:29:34,778 --> 00:29:37,576
She shall have milk
wherever she goes, hot or cold.

244
00:29:37,647 --> 00:29:40,878
- Hot.
- Yeah, I know. That's what I said.

245
00:29:46,856 --> 00:29:48,790
Open the door.

246
00:30:28,932 --> 00:30:31,901
Darling, I need to talk to you.

247
00:30:33,236 --> 00:30:36,467
My darling, I've sent Jacques
for some milk. I only have a moment.

248
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:40,373
- Well, let's make the most of it.
- No! Stop it.

249
00:30:40,443 --> 00:30:42,968
- It was your idea.
- Yes,but you're the wrong--

250
00:30:43,046 --> 00:30:46,277
The wrong what? Man?
You think I was--

251
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:49,841
No. I thought you were exactly
who you are,but I'm too impulsive.

252
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,080
I mean, this is not the right way.

253
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,481
- Another time?
- Huh?

254
00:31:33,229 --> 00:31:35,754
- Here you are, my beloved.
- Thank you.

255
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,634
It's all they had.

256
00:31:39,702 --> 00:31:43,365
Can't get a thing in this hotel.
I had to force them to give me that.

257
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:45,031
Never mind.

258
00:31:55,818 --> 00:31:58,514
My darling, lovely darling.

259
00:32:00,123 --> 00:32:01,613
What's wrong?

260
00:32:01,691 --> 00:32:05,218
My darling, your feet
are like two icicles.

261
00:32:05,295 --> 00:32:07,229
Have you been out of bed
or something?

262
00:32:07,297 --> 00:32:10,391
No, of course not.

263
00:32:10,466 --> 00:32:14,266
Oh, well, anyway,
you warm them on me, eh?

264
00:32:31,688 --> 00:32:34,384
This is Princess Dala.
My guests have gone...

265
00:32:34,457 --> 00:32:36,789
and I thought perhaps
you'd come back and have a drink.

266
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:38,793
I would feel better
if we're friends.

267
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:43,560
Oh, I would too, and I'd love to come,
but my leg is rather painful.

268
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:46,100
I'm sorry. Another time.

269
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:48,296
Why don't you come up here?

270
00:32:48,371 --> 00:32:50,362
Because my leg is only bad
if I walk too much...

271
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,705
and I thought maybe you could do
the walking and I could do the drinking.

272
00:32:56,312 --> 00:33:00,271
Unless, of course, you think it would be
indiscreet to come to a man's room.

273
00:33:01,517 --> 00:33:04,577
I'll be there in five minutes.
Good-bye, Sir Charles.

274
00:33:04,654 --> 00:33:06,315
Good-bye.

275
00:33:38,021 --> 00:33:42,515
Oh, I don't know what's wrong.
I'm just a bundle of nerves.

276
00:33:42,592 --> 00:33:46,153
Well, don't worry.
We've solved that problem before.

277
00:33:46,229 --> 00:33:47,787
- You don't mean--
- Of course.

278
00:33:47,864 --> 00:33:50,731
- Oh, Jacques, I don't think you should.
- Don't worry, my darling.

279
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,327
- I shall do it ever so softly.
- Oh, Jacques, are you sure?

280
00:33:54,404 --> 00:33:56,929
My darling, of course.
It's always worked before.

281
00:33:57,006 --> 00:33:59,270
There's no reason
why it should not work now.

282
00:33:59,342 --> 00:34:02,573
You just relax
and leave everything to me.

283
00:34:18,461 --> 00:34:21,521
- Yes, my darling?
- I don't think that's such a good idea.

284
00:34:22,732 --> 00:34:24,666
You mean that it's not helping?

285
00:34:24,734 --> 00:34:28,534
I'm afraid not. I think
I'll just take a sleeping pill.

286
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:32,607
Very well, my darling.
I'll get it for you.

287
00:34:32,675 --> 00:34:37,544
And why don't you take one yourself?
I-- You need the rest, you know?

288
00:34:39,182 --> 00:34:41,377
Yes, I think perhaps I will, dear.

289
00:35:07,743 --> 00:35:09,677
Here, my darling.

290
00:35:13,749 --> 00:35:16,513
- Thank you, my angel.
- Thank you, my angel.

291
00:35:39,308 --> 00:35:41,105
My poor Jacques.

292
00:35:42,545 --> 00:35:47,414
No matter. When you've seen
one Stradivarius, you've seen them all.

293
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,492
I hadn't realized
it was so late.

294
00:35:59,562 --> 00:36:02,827
Come in, sit down, relax.
Have a nice glass of champagne.

295
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:06,232
- I told you I don't drink.
- Oh, champagne's not drinking.

296
00:36:06,302 --> 00:36:09,635
That's the minimum of alcohol
and the maximum of companionship.

297
00:36:09,705 --> 00:36:11,673
It's still against my principles.

298
00:36:11,741 --> 00:36:14,141
Oh, that's too bad.
I thought it might break the ice.

299
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,202
- You took me to task rather properly.
- No, thank you.

300
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,748
I thought your analysis
was very perceptive.

301
00:36:19,815 --> 00:36:22,807
- But not very polite.
- No, it wasn't.

302
00:36:22,885 --> 00:36:25,353
- What made you do it?
- I resented you.

303
00:36:25,421 --> 00:36:28,652
I find it hard to understand
a man of your reputation.

304
00:36:28,724 --> 00:36:30,658
You know, we both
have reputations.

305
00:36:30,726 --> 00:36:33,320
Perhaps mine is a little more
highly publicized than yours...

306
00:36:33,396 --> 00:36:35,626
but you have presented the press
with a rather definite image.

307
00:36:35,698 --> 00:36:37,427
Yes, I know.

308
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,297
- Well, are you?
- What?

309
00:36:39,368 --> 00:36:41,996
What they call you.
The virgin queen.

310
00:36:42,071 --> 00:36:44,335
I'm not the queen.

311
00:36:46,242 --> 00:36:48,176
That's only half an answer.

312
00:36:48,244 --> 00:36:51,372
The strong-willed ruler of ten million
people, sitting in her ivory tower...

313
00:36:51,447 --> 00:36:55,144
untouched, unwed
and unapproachable.

314
00:36:56,485 --> 00:36:59,818
If you had known my father,
you would understand me.

315
00:36:59,889 --> 00:37:02,084
He was an absolute ruler.

316
00:37:02,158 --> 00:37:04,319
He governed his people
with an iron hand...

317
00:37:04,393 --> 00:37:07,521
but he gave me a white pony
for my fifth birthday.

318
00:37:07,597 --> 00:37:09,963
He was wrong about many things...

319
00:37:10,032 --> 00:37:13,024
but he made his decisions according
to the ways of his predecessors.

320
00:37:14,604 --> 00:37:18,438
I learned the way of the West,
so I've become a little of both--

321
00:37:18,507 --> 00:37:22,568
a paradox-- and it is hard
to reconcile the extremes.

322
00:37:23,446 --> 00:37:26,847
Have a glass of champagne.
Does wonders for extremes.

323
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:30,113
It's been known to launch
some lasting friendships.

324
00:37:35,324 --> 00:37:38,157
- Don't you trust me?
- No.

325
00:37:38,227 --> 00:37:41,856
- Are you afraid?
- No.

326
00:37:53,576 --> 00:37:58,013
I was three years old
when I rode my first elephant.

327
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,642
I was six when I went
on my first ""safrari""--

328
00:38:05,087 --> 00:38:07,317
""frasari""--

329
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,585
wild animal hunt--

330
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:12,856
and I was ten when I bagged
my first tiger.

331
00:38:13,629 --> 00:38:16,928
But I'll never forget
my lovely little pony.

332
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:18,762
When did you bag him?

333
00:38:20,636 --> 00:38:24,697
Oh, you're making fun again.
You really don't like animals.

334
00:38:24,774 --> 00:38:28,039
Don't trust a man
who doesn't care about animals...

335
00:38:29,812 --> 00:38:31,780
and don't trust an animal...

336
00:38:31,847 --> 00:38:34,475
who doesn't care about people.

337
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:38,587
Why you don't like people?

338
00:38:38,654 --> 00:38:40,315
I like people.

339
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:46,424
That's supposed to be
me who doesn't...

340
00:38:46,495 --> 00:38:48,963
Iike people, right?

341
00:38:49,031 --> 00:38:50,828
If you say so.

342
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:55,668
I don't say so.
You say so.

343
00:38:55,738 --> 00:38:57,569
- Right?
- I said so.

344
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,973
And another thing you did,
you didn't tell me the truth.

345
00:39:02,278 --> 00:39:05,645
- About what?
- About champagne. About this.

346
00:39:07,983 --> 00:39:11,009
Oh,boy, did you fib.

347
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:16,821
You said something
about extremes.

348
00:39:16,892 --> 00:39:19,452
It does wonders for them.

349
00:39:19,528 --> 00:39:24,022
It does more than that.
It makes your lips numb.

350
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:28,002
I can't feel them.
Are they still there?

351
00:39:31,173 --> 00:39:33,107
Let's have a look.

352
00:39:36,445 --> 00:39:38,777
You didn't tell me
about that part.

353
00:39:47,656 --> 00:39:50,284
Won't do you any good.
I can't feel it.

354
00:39:55,164 --> 00:39:58,292
Hoisted on your own petard.

355
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:02,929
Oh, don't try to say that
when you haven't got any lips.

356
00:40:09,245 --> 00:40:10,872
I'm plastered.

357
00:40:12,481 --> 00:40:15,541
- If that's the right expression.
- Yes, that's the right expression.

358
00:40:16,752 --> 00:40:19,186
You're a fraud and a liar...

359
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:22,980
and you think you are going
to take advantage of me.

360
00:40:23,058 --> 00:40:25,652
Oh, no. You think I am.

361
00:40:25,728 --> 00:40:29,425
I know you are.
That's the plan, isn't it?

362
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,525
Feed me champagne...

363
00:40:33,602 --> 00:40:35,536
break down the inhibitions...

364
00:40:35,604 --> 00:40:37,435
and tallyho.

365
00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:44,906
No more virgin queen.

366
00:40:46,882 --> 00:40:49,612
Oh, we're all out of champagne.

367
00:40:49,685 --> 00:40:51,744
- I'll get another bottle.
- Oh, no!

368
00:40:53,856 --> 00:40:56,324
I prefer to remain conscious...

369
00:40:56,392 --> 00:41:01,261
so I may view the attempted
seduction at firsthand...

370
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:04,128
because you've got
a surprise coming, Charlie.

371
00:41:05,334 --> 00:41:08,360
I got friends in low places.

372
00:41:08,437 --> 00:41:11,929
You make one pass at me,
and I'll sic him on you.

373
00:41:12,007 --> 00:41:13,634
Understand?

374
00:41:13,709 --> 00:41:17,145
If he moves a muscle,
attack without mercy.

375
00:41:19,415 --> 00:41:21,679
You see, Charlie?

376
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:25,186
You're outnumbered,
two against one...

377
00:41:25,254 --> 00:41:27,779
and I don't care
if you can juggle.

378
00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:42,697
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

379
00:41:42,771 --> 00:41:45,604
Hmm? Cat got your tongue?

380
00:41:46,675 --> 00:41:51,009
Got his tongue? Mm-mm.
My friend says he hasn't got it.

381
00:41:52,014 --> 00:41:56,644
- Then, why don't you say something?
- I couldn't think of anything to say.

382
00:41:58,921 --> 00:42:01,856
Why don't you kiss me again?

383
00:42:04,026 --> 00:42:05,118
All right.

384
00:42:12,935 --> 00:42:16,598
You know what, Charlie?
I could feel that one.

385
00:42:18,707 --> 00:42:20,140
Again.

386
00:42:30,085 --> 00:42:34,647
If I were my father,
I'd have you tortured.

387
00:42:34,723 --> 00:42:37,954
No. If you were your father...

388
00:42:38,027 --> 00:42:40,188
I doubt very much
if I would have kissed you.

389
00:42:42,331 --> 00:42:44,526
Good thinking, Charlie.

390
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,229
Then, now that we've
straightened out who I am...

391
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:50,238
what are you going
to do about it?

392
00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:06,251
What kind of a friend are you?
You were supposed to attack.

393
00:43:09,224 --> 00:43:12,159
No friends, Charlie.
Now you got me outnumbered.

394
00:43:12,227 --> 00:43:15,355
I thought we were friends.

395
00:43:15,431 --> 00:43:18,764
You are the juggler.
I am the virgin queen.

396
00:43:18,834 --> 00:43:21,064
Somebody's got to win.

397
00:43:21,136 --> 00:43:24,230
Friends don't act like that.

398
00:43:24,306 --> 00:43:27,639
Want to be friends, Charlie,
or want to win?

399
00:43:34,316 --> 00:43:36,841
You really want to know?

400
00:43:51,734 --> 00:43:53,463
What's wrong?

401
00:43:53,535 --> 00:43:56,902
I don't feel--
I think I'm going--

402
00:43:56,972 --> 00:43:59,634
Good-bye, Charlie.

403
00:44:03,178 --> 00:44:05,112
Here, um--

404
00:44:11,253 --> 00:44:13,744
Darling. Dala.

405
00:44:15,758 --> 00:44:19,125
Ma'am? Your Highness!

406
00:45:56,024 --> 00:45:58,219
Oh, thank you. Up.

407
00:45:59,762 --> 00:46:01,696
There we are.

408
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,697
Hello, Uncle Charles.

409
00:46:08,103 --> 00:46:09,536
George!

410
00:46:21,617 --> 00:46:25,781
Hello. Good morning.
Listen, what about this nephew?

411
00:46:25,854 --> 00:46:28,118
- How did you find out?
- I met him in the bar last night.

412
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:30,522
That's what I was trying
to explain to you at the window.

413
00:46:30,592 --> 00:46:34,119
- What happened to you?
- Jacques dragged me back to the hotel.

414
00:46:34,196 --> 00:46:36,323
- I looked everywhere for you.
- Well, I looked everywhere for you.

415
00:46:36,398 --> 00:46:38,798
In fact, I nearly climbed in bed
with your nephew.

416
00:46:38,867 --> 00:46:42,598
- You what?
- Don't worry. I took care of it.

417
00:46:42,671 --> 00:46:45,834
Well, he had kind of a heavy night. I
almost put the princess in bed with him.

418
00:46:45,908 --> 00:46:48,308
- Really?
- What you got there?

419
00:46:48,377 --> 00:46:51,073
A note to Uncle Charles.

420
00:46:51,146 --> 00:46:53,706
""Dear Uncle Charles,
Don't worry about a thing.

421
00:46:53,782 --> 00:46:57,616
I've gone to see the princess
to apologize for last night.""

422
00:46:57,686 --> 00:46:59,620
Apologize for what?
Nothing happened.

423
00:46:59,688 --> 00:47:03,146
It must have been rather embarrassing,
expecting to end up with one man--

424
00:47:03,225 --> 00:47:05,159
She didn't expect
to wind up with anybody.

425
00:47:05,227 --> 00:47:08,424
She just had a couple glasses
of champagne and had to rest a while.

426
00:47:08,497 --> 00:47:11,466
- Of course.
- Think of him taking over my room.

427
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:14,468
- Well, didn't you know he was coming?
- No. I haven't seen him for years.

428
00:47:14,536 --> 00:47:16,470
But who is he?
What is he?

429
00:47:16,538 --> 00:47:20,235
Well, he is my nephew, really.
He's my late brother's son...

430
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:23,540
and I've been responsible for him
ever since he was ten years old.

431
00:47:23,612 --> 00:47:25,807
I sent him to all
the best schools in America.

432
00:47:25,881 --> 00:47:27,974
He did very well,
as a matter of fact.

433
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:30,518
He's just graduated
from college. Look.

434
00:47:34,857 --> 00:47:36,791
Isn't he a bit old for school?

435
00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:38,850
Well, he did two years in the army.

436
00:47:38,927 --> 00:47:42,385
Then he lost another whole year after
that to some strange tropical disease.

437
00:47:42,464 --> 00:47:44,591
Anyway, he's certainly attractive.

438
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:48,033
There's a slight family resemblance.
Otherwise, we have nothing in common.

439
00:47:48,103 --> 00:47:51,300
He's dedicated to education.
He passed at the top of his class.

440
00:47:51,373 --> 00:47:55,332
Cares nothing about sports,
and he's never once mentioned girls.

441
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:58,743
Well, he may not mention them,but he's
got a pretty good idea what they are.

442
00:47:58,814 --> 00:48:01,339
In fact, I nearly didn't
get out of here last night.

443
00:48:01,416 --> 00:48:02,849
You're joking.

444
00:48:02,918 --> 00:48:05,682
It was a relief to get back
to Jacques and his fiddle.

445
00:48:05,754 --> 00:48:08,052
Still, if we don't do something soon,
he's gonna ruin everything.

446
00:48:08,123 --> 00:48:11,286
- You mean if I don't do something.
- It shouldn't be too difficult.

447
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,954
He's just a young man
who's not been out in the world.

448
00:48:14,029 --> 00:48:17,021
That's because he's been spending
all his time in the bedroom.

449
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:19,897
- I'm surprised at you.
- Oh, I can handle it.

450
00:48:19,968 --> 00:48:22,436
As a matter of fact,
it might be rather intriguing...

451
00:48:22,504 --> 00:48:26,133
particularly if the family resemblance
goes deeper than you think.

452
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:27,675
I'm envious.

453
00:48:27,743 --> 00:48:30,712
Well, it seems that we're somewhat
in the same spot, my love.

454
00:48:30,779 --> 00:48:33,748
You envy George,
and I envy the princess.

455
00:48:36,718 --> 00:48:38,913
I really don't know
what I'm going to do yet.

456
00:48:38,987 --> 00:48:42,320
I might even go back to college
and get my doctorate.

457
00:48:42,391 --> 00:48:44,325
But I'm torn.

458
00:48:44,393 --> 00:48:46,725
I feel there's so many things
to be done in the world...

459
00:48:46,795 --> 00:48:49,662
so many backward countries
where I might be useful.

460
00:48:49,731 --> 00:48:52,325
I've even been considering
the Peace Corps.

461
00:48:52,401 --> 00:48:54,835
You're certainly not
much like your uncle.

462
00:48:54,903 --> 00:48:56,768
Well, I don't know
too much about my uncle...

463
00:48:56,838 --> 00:48:59,033
except what I've read
in the newspapers and magazines.

464
00:48:59,107 --> 00:49:02,201
- One certainly mustn't judge by that.
- No?

465
00:49:02,277 --> 00:49:05,405
After all, whatever I am today,
he made it possible.

466
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,415
I guess everyone has
at least one redeeming quality.

467
00:49:08,483 --> 00:49:09,916
Yes.

468
00:49:17,059 --> 00:49:19,755
Good morning, Your Highness.
Hair of the dog.

469
00:49:19,828 --> 00:49:22,023
- May I present Madame Clouseau.
- Good morning.

470
00:49:22,097 --> 00:49:25,533
- This is my Americanized nephew George.
- Yes. We met at the bar last night.

471
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,262
- How is your cough?
- Oh, it's completely gone. Thank you.

472
00:49:28,337 --> 00:49:32,273
You should have a glass of this. It'll
put everything in its right perspective.

473
00:49:32,341 --> 00:49:36,107
My perspective is excellent this
morning. I see your leg is much better.

474
00:49:36,178 --> 00:49:38,772
Oh, it's a vast improvement, ma'am.
Thank you. Very much better.

475
00:49:38,847 --> 00:49:42,613
We had a wonderful family reunion
last night after we carried you home.

476
00:49:42,684 --> 00:49:44,481
- He's quite a lad.
- So I've discovered.

477
00:49:44,553 --> 00:49:48,250
He's considering the Peace Corps.
Imagine a Lytton in the Peace Corps.

478
00:49:48,323 --> 00:49:50,757
Be careful, or you'll be giving
your family a good name.

479
00:49:50,826 --> 00:49:52,760
- Please sit down.
- No, thank you.

480
00:49:52,828 --> 00:49:55,126
I was on my way to ski
when I ran into Sir Charles.

481
00:49:55,197 --> 00:49:58,428
- Do you ski, Mr. Lytton?
- Ski?

482
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,162
- No, not very well.
- You should learn, George.

483
00:50:01,236 --> 00:50:03,761
If it wasn't for this ropy leg of mine,
I'd take you in hand myself.

484
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:08,173
I'm hardly in your uncle's class,
but I'd be happy to teach you.

485
00:50:08,243 --> 00:50:12,509
I'm sure Madame is an excellent teacher.
She could surely get you started right.

486
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:14,515
Well, if it wouldn't be
too much trouble, yeah.

487
00:50:14,583 --> 00:50:17,051
Not at all.
It would be a pleasure.

488
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,883
Perhaps you'd like
to come along now.

489
00:50:19,955 --> 00:50:22,150
George, you can't pass up
an invitation like that.

490
00:50:22,224 --> 00:50:24,624
I haven't got the proper clothes,
and I don't have any skis.

491
00:50:24,693 --> 00:50:27,856
Well, the shop will fix you up.
Just charge everything to me.

492
00:50:27,929 --> 00:50:31,194
Thanks. Your Highness,
hope to see you again.

493
00:50:31,266 --> 00:50:34,235
If you're back early.
I'm leaving on the afternoon train.

494
00:50:35,203 --> 00:50:37,137
- Have a nice trip.
- Thank you.

495
00:50:37,205 --> 00:50:38,638
- Thanks, Uncle Charles.
- Have fun.

496
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:42,506
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

497
00:50:42,577 --> 00:50:45,205
- Mind her. She knows what she's doing.
- I'm sure she does.

498
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,214
- You're not staying?
- No. We're off to the slopes.

499
00:50:47,282 --> 00:50:50,080
I'll get the door.
So long, Uncle Charles.

500
00:50:50,152 --> 00:50:52,245
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

501
00:50:53,789 --> 00:50:56,553
Just in time. Thank you.
You sure you won't join me?

502
00:50:56,625 --> 00:50:58,217
Quite sure.

503
00:51:01,897 --> 00:51:05,162
- Do you have to leave this afternoon?
- Yes.

504
00:51:05,233 --> 00:51:07,258
Isn't this departure rather sudden?

505
00:51:07,335 --> 00:51:09,599
Not at all.
Why do you think so?

506
00:51:09,671 --> 00:51:12,139
Well, I just thought that
after last night--

507
00:51:12,207 --> 00:51:14,971
My leaving has nothing
to do with last night.

508
00:51:15,043 --> 00:51:17,978
- Hasn't it?
- You don't know me very well.

509
00:51:18,046 --> 00:51:20,480
No,but I thought last night
I was making some progress.

510
00:51:20,549 --> 00:51:23,074
That was champagne,
nothing more.

511
00:51:23,151 --> 00:51:26,143
Well, whatever it was,
it was very interesting.

512
00:51:26,221 --> 00:51:29,850
- I really don't remember.
- That's such an awful old cliche.

513
00:51:29,925 --> 00:51:32,621
- It's true.
- You know, the majority of women...

514
00:51:32,694 --> 00:51:35,162
they have half a glass too much
and let down the barriers a little...

515
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:37,164
then they wake up in the morning
riddled with guilt...

516
00:51:37,232 --> 00:51:40,167
and think they can reclaim their virtue
by saying, ""l don't remember.""

517
00:51:41,036 --> 00:51:43,266
Are you saying my virtue
is not intact?

518
00:51:43,338 --> 00:51:45,499
- You know it is.
- Then why should I feel guilty?

519
00:51:45,574 --> 00:51:47,838
You're not concerned
about what happened.

520
00:51:47,909 --> 00:51:50,173
You're worried about
what might have happened.

521
00:51:50,245 --> 00:51:53,180
That makes you vulnerable.
That makes you a woman.

522
00:51:53,248 --> 00:51:55,182
You're an arrogant fool.

523
00:51:56,918 --> 00:52:01,048
Perhaps. But after what I just said,
a real woman would've slapped my face.

524
00:52:12,467 --> 00:52:14,799
Whew, I'm glad that's over.
Friends again?

525
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:16,599
Friends.

526
00:52:16,671 --> 00:52:20,107
Good. Now the least you can do
is let me take you to the station.

527
00:52:20,175 --> 00:52:22,302
- All right.
- You really have to go, though?

528
00:52:22,377 --> 00:52:25,005
- Yes, I must go.
- Oh, that's too bad.

529
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,571
- Nothing I can say to make you stay?
- Nothing.

530
00:52:27,649 --> 00:52:29,583
- What time do you have to be there?
- 3:00.

531
00:52:29,651 --> 00:52:32,916
3:00 on the dot,
I'll be here, Your Highness.

532
00:52:36,324 --> 00:52:37,757
3:00.

533
00:52:47,602 --> 00:52:49,968
Look, do we have to start
the lessons right away?

534
00:52:50,038 --> 00:52:52,268
That's what we're up here for,
is it not?

535
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:55,832
I was hoping we could talk
about last night.

536
00:52:55,911 --> 00:53:00,007
- We can talk about that later.
- You were more fun in bed.

537
00:53:00,081 --> 00:53:03,073
- Would you do me a favor, Mr. Lytton?
- Sure, if you call me George.

538
00:53:03,151 --> 00:53:06,086
Forget about last night.
I was impetuous.

539
00:53:06,154 --> 00:53:08,918
I had too much to drink, and
I'd just had a fight with my husband.

540
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:12,721
It might be easy for you to forget,but
I didn't sleep a wink after you left.

541
00:53:12,794 --> 00:53:15,058
It was a very frustrating
experience.

542
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:17,826
I'm afraid that's your problem,
but I wouldn't make any plans.

543
00:53:17,899 --> 00:53:22,962
Oh, I never make any plans. I just
sort of follow my instincts, you know?

544
00:53:23,038 --> 00:53:26,007
George, it's four miles
down the mountain...

545
00:53:26,074 --> 00:53:28,008
and I'm a very good skier.

546
00:53:28,076 --> 00:53:31,637
You follow your instincts too closely,
and you're liable to break your neck.

547
00:53:31,713 --> 00:53:35,149
Now, the first things to learn
about skiing are the fundamentals.

548
00:53:35,217 --> 00:53:37,276
Let's see you turn around.

549
00:53:40,422 --> 00:53:43,516
It's not as easy as it looks.
Let me give you a hand.

550
00:53:44,826 --> 00:53:48,990
Ah, let's try something easier.
It's a lot easier, honest.

551
00:53:49,064 --> 00:53:52,295
- I told you to watch those instincts.
- I'm busy. You watch them.

552
00:53:52,367 --> 00:53:55,200
- You're abominable.
- Yeah, that's me.

553
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:59,206
- The Abominable Snowman.
- Now, George, stop it!

554
00:54:02,978 --> 00:54:05,037
Imbecile!

555
00:54:21,596 --> 00:54:23,223
Perhaps we'll meet again.

556
00:54:23,298 --> 00:54:25,732
- Good-bye, Sir Charles.
- Just a minute.

557
00:54:27,469 --> 00:54:29,903
- That's him. There he goes.
- Who?

558
00:54:29,971 --> 00:54:32,906
The man who stole your dog,
in that little car.

559
00:55:19,921 --> 00:55:21,354
Whoa!

560
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,325
- How's it going?
- Fine. I'm going to miss her.

561
00:55:25,393 --> 00:55:28,021
Let that be a lesson to you. Never
get too involved with your victims.

562
00:55:28,096 --> 00:55:30,929
- Shall we get out in the open?
- No. It's a bit hard here. Come on.

563
00:55:33,368 --> 00:55:37,634
That's good. That's okay.
Right, start. Give it to me now.

564
00:55:45,714 --> 00:55:48,012
- How close are they?
- Now.

565
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:51,177
- Sorry. Ready?
- Right.

566
00:55:53,621 --> 00:55:56,852
Come on, little doggy.
Here we are.

567
00:55:59,828 --> 00:56:01,819
Look out!

568
00:56:12,273 --> 00:56:14,537
She's got the dog.
I will see you later.

569
00:59:47,565 --> 00:59:51,763
-Youhave a wonderful smile.
- I have a great deal to smile about.

570
00:59:51,835 --> 00:59:54,360
I have Amber back,
and I'm having a wonderful time.

571
00:59:54,438 --> 00:59:56,372
You missed your train.

572
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,374
There's one at midnight
and one in the morning.

573
00:59:58,442 --> 01:00:00,637
Perhaps I should arrange
to have your dog kidnapped again.

574
01:00:00,711 --> 01:00:02,406
Then you'd be bound to stay.

575
01:00:03,747 --> 01:00:05,908
Did you arrange to have her
kidnapped the first time?

576
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:08,012
Of course.

577
01:00:13,223 --> 01:00:17,250
Well, I am willing
to bet you 10,000 francs...

578
01:00:17,328 --> 01:00:20,161
that the Phantom is in Cortina
at this very moment...

579
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:22,221
even perhaps in this very room.

580
01:00:22,299 --> 01:00:24,665
How exciting.
What do you think, Mr. Tucker?

581
01:00:24,735 --> 01:00:26,669
Oh, I agree with the inspector.

582
01:00:26,737 --> 01:00:30,002
You see, 10 of his last 15 victims have
been guests at Angela Dunning's parties.

583
01:00:30,074 --> 01:00:32,702
What are you all talking about?

584
01:00:32,776 --> 01:00:36,337
- The notorious Phantom.
- I'm afraid I've never heard of him.

585
01:00:36,413 --> 01:00:38,938
What little I've read about him,
he seems to be quite a fellow.

586
01:00:39,016 --> 01:00:42,474
Believe me, there are few thieves
who are as clever as the Phantom.

587
01:00:42,553 --> 01:00:45,147
Each theft is completely
different and unique...

588
01:00:45,222 --> 01:00:47,349
classic in its conception.

589
01:00:47,424 --> 01:00:50,587
But I thought you were working on
the theory that he does repeat himself.

590
01:00:50,661 --> 01:00:53,425
Only as far as
Angela Dunning's parties are concerned.

591
01:00:53,497 --> 01:00:55,965
However, there is
one other duplication...

592
01:00:56,033 --> 01:01:01,300
but that is his trademark,
his calling card, so to speak.

593
01:01:01,372 --> 01:01:04,273
He always leaves
a white monogrammed glove.

594
01:01:04,341 --> 01:01:06,309
Sounds terribly theatrical.

595
01:01:06,377 --> 01:01:09,938
Your Highness, if I were the Phantom,
I'd have chosen my victim already.

596
01:01:10,014 --> 01:01:12,244
Really? And who would that be?

597
01:01:12,316 --> 01:01:16,047
Well, who has the most
fabulous diamond in the world?

598
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:19,089
- I suppose I do.
- Exactly. The Pink Panther.

599
01:01:19,156 --> 01:01:21,954
Such a prize he could never resist.
He would be bound to try for it.

600
01:01:22,026 --> 01:01:25,587
I'm afraid he'd be disappointed.
The Pink Panther is in my safe at--

601
01:01:25,663 --> 01:01:28,325
Your Highness, please.
Don't say it, not here.

602
01:01:28,399 --> 01:01:30,333
If I'm not being too nosy,
Your Highness...

603
01:01:30,401 --> 01:01:33,893
I read somewhere there was some dispute
over the ownership of the Pink Panther.

604
01:01:33,971 --> 01:01:37,463
It belongs to me.
It was a gift from my late father.

605
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:40,009
- I shall never surrender it.
- Why should you?

606
01:01:40,077 --> 01:01:42,272
When the present government
seized power...

607
01:01:42,346 --> 01:01:45,144
they claimed the diamond
was the property of the people.

608
01:01:45,215 --> 01:01:48,981
There's even some talk of the
lnternational Court deciding the issue.

609
01:01:49,053 --> 01:01:52,454
Why don't I steal the diamond
and leave that old glove behind?

610
01:01:52,523 --> 01:01:55,424
- You and I could split the insurance.
- All right.

611
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:00,524
- I feel like dancing. Your Highness?
- I'd love to.

612
01:02:02,266 --> 01:02:05,793
- How about you, madame?
- Y es, of course.

613
01:02:05,869 --> 01:02:08,929
- Your leg is better, Sir Charles.
- What?

614
01:02:09,006 --> 01:02:13,102
- I say, your leg is better.
- Oh, yes, much better. Thank you.

615
01:02:14,278 --> 01:02:15,870
You know, Mr. Tucker--

616
01:02:19,616 --> 01:02:22,210
- It's my beer, old man.
- My hand. It burnt--

617
01:02:22,286 --> 01:02:23,719
I'm sorry.

618
01:02:27,224 --> 01:02:28,657
Sit down.

619
01:02:32,563 --> 01:02:35,225
Seems to be working out
better than we expected.

620
01:02:35,299 --> 01:02:37,563
The only thing we've found out
is that it's not here.

621
01:02:37,634 --> 01:02:40,330
You shouldn't have any trouble
discovering exactly where it is.

622
01:02:40,404 --> 01:02:44,033
Her Highness seems
to be completely captivated.

623
01:02:44,108 --> 01:02:46,440
I'd say that's
a considerable exaggeration.

624
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:50,139
You're either showing a touch of
senility or you need glasses, my love.

625
01:02:50,214 --> 01:02:52,148
When I'm showing
my senility, darling...

626
01:02:52,216 --> 01:02:54,582
you'll be occupying your time
with your grandchildren.

627
01:02:54,651 --> 01:02:57,518
One has to have children
before one has grandchildren.

628
01:02:57,588 --> 01:02:59,351
You wouldn't dare.

629
01:02:59,423 --> 01:03:03,223
Jacques would make a wonderful father.
He has many redeeming qualities.

630
01:03:03,293 --> 01:03:04,555
Name one.

631
01:03:04,628 --> 01:03:07,722
He's kind, loyal,
faithful, obedient.

632
01:03:07,798 --> 01:03:10,289
You're either married
to a Boy Scout or a Dachshund.

633
01:03:10,367 --> 01:03:13,962
- And he adores me.
- That eliminates the Boy Scouts.

634
01:03:15,806 --> 01:03:17,569
- Good night.
- Thank you.

635
01:03:25,983 --> 01:03:28,178
- You seem to have lost something.
- Y es.

636
01:03:28,252 --> 01:03:31,881
- How'd you like to borrow mine?
- Thanks, Uncle Charles, yes.

637
01:03:31,955 --> 01:03:33,388
Madame.

638
01:03:40,564 --> 01:03:43,897
- You've been avoiding me.
- That about describes it.

639
01:03:43,967 --> 01:03:47,630
-You know what I've been thinking?
-Y es, that's why I've been avoiding you.

640
01:03:47,704 --> 01:03:51,401
I don't think you were really looking
for me that night in my uncle's bedroom.

641
01:03:51,475 --> 01:03:53,443
- Don't be ridiculous.
- No, I mean it.

642
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:55,535
Not the way you treated me today.

643
01:03:55,612 --> 01:03:57,603
- You know what I think?
- What?

644
01:03:57,681 --> 01:03:59,114
Well--

645
01:03:59,817 --> 01:04:01,284
Oh, yeah.

646
01:04:01,351 --> 01:04:03,683
What do you think, George?

647
01:04:03,754 --> 01:04:06,689
Well, I think maybe I was wrong.

648
01:04:11,662 --> 01:04:15,359
I'm sorry I have to leave, but
I must make a very important phone call.

649
01:04:15,432 --> 01:04:18,333
- Can't it wait?
- I'm afraid not.

650
01:04:18,402 --> 01:04:19,869
Good night.

651
01:04:33,784 --> 01:04:35,217
That's better.

652
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:43,651
Just a quick shower, my love,
and I will be right with you.

653
01:05:07,384 --> 01:05:09,318
One moment, please.

654
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:14,723
Hello--

655
01:05:15,559 --> 01:05:16,890
Inspector Clouseau.

656
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,452
Inspector Clouseau,
this is the prefect of police.

657
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:23,363
- I have information about the Phantom.
- The Phantom?

658
01:05:23,433 --> 01:05:25,901
Y es, you must come at once.
I'm in Brunico.

659
01:05:25,969 --> 01:05:29,928
Brunico, but that's in Brunico.
I mean, that's 30 miles from here.

660
01:05:30,007 --> 01:05:31,872
It is here that I have
discovered the information.

661
01:05:31,942 --> 01:05:35,070
It is imperative you come immediately.
I cannot say more. I am being watched.

662
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:39,078
Yes. I understand, yes.

663
01:05:41,418 --> 01:05:44,546
I'm sorry, my darling.
Important police business.

664
01:05:44,621 --> 01:05:46,851
I will be back with you
as soon as possible.

665
01:05:46,924 --> 01:05:49,552
I understand, my love.

666
01:05:49,626 --> 01:05:52,151
- My darling.
- Yes?

667
01:05:52,229 --> 01:05:56,188
I am a husband that must be
envied by all other husbands.

668
01:05:56,266 --> 01:05:59,133
I'm sure no one
ever had a husband like you.

669
01:05:59,202 --> 01:06:01,227
My darling.

670
01:06:04,341 --> 01:06:06,809
My darling, don't move.
Don't panic.

671
01:06:06,877 --> 01:06:09,038
All that has happened
is that my hat has caught...

672
01:06:09,112 --> 01:06:12,741
in one of your naughty
little hairpins.

673
01:06:12,816 --> 01:06:14,306
Voila.

674
01:06:20,123 --> 01:06:22,990
You know, at times like this...

675
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:25,927
I wish I was
but a simple peasant.

676
01:06:25,996 --> 01:06:30,194
It's times like this that make me
realize how lucky I really am.

677
01:07:01,531 --> 01:07:04,625
He's gone to Brunico.
Another call about the Phantom.

678
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:08,934
Well, there's something going on.

679
01:07:09,006 --> 01:07:11,873
I don't quite know what it is,
but there's something wrong.

680
01:07:11,942 --> 01:07:13,876
Do you want to call it off?

681
01:07:13,944 --> 01:07:15,878
I don't know.
I'm considering it.

682
01:07:15,946 --> 01:07:18,506
- Have you considered something else?
- What's that?

683
01:07:18,582 --> 01:07:21,016
The possibility that
you're growing a conscience.

684
01:07:21,084 --> 01:07:23,951
- A conscience? About what?
- The princess.

685
01:07:25,322 --> 01:07:27,813
- You're being ridiculous.
- No, I'm just being a woman.

686
01:07:27,891 --> 01:07:31,156
This time, you've chosen yourself
a fascinating victim.

687
01:07:31,228 --> 01:07:35,358
I suspect you've broken the first rule
and allowed yourself to become involved.

688
01:07:35,432 --> 01:07:37,730
You're being a woman, all right.

689
01:07:37,801 --> 01:07:41,259
That's obvious. Competition
always makes a woman obvious.

690
01:07:43,407 --> 01:07:45,671
- Who is it?
- Bellboy.

691
01:07:48,545 --> 01:07:50,479
Wait a minute.

692
01:07:52,816 --> 01:07:55,580
- What is it?
- Flowers.

693
01:08:05,762 --> 01:08:07,627
- George!
- Trick or treat.

694
01:08:07,697 --> 01:08:10,894
- Now, wait a minute.
- I found these growing in the hall.

695
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:17,531
- You get right out of here.
- What kind of hospitality is that?

696
01:08:17,607 --> 01:08:19,575
But, listen, my husband
could be back any minute.

697
01:08:19,643 --> 01:08:22,908
He must be about
halfway to Brunico by now.

698
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:25,209
"You must come to Brunico
immediately, lnspector.

699
01:08:25,282 --> 01:08:27,876
I have information
about the Phantom.

700
01:08:27,951 --> 01:08:31,250
And while you're in Brunico,
waiting for the prefect of police--"

701
01:08:31,321 --> 01:08:32,879
Thank you very much.

702
01:08:32,956 --> 01:08:35,982
"l shall be investigating
your wife."

703
01:08:39,029 --> 01:08:41,361
One never knows, huh?

704
01:08:41,431 --> 01:08:43,922
Perhaps the Phantom
is hiding under the bed?

705
01:08:45,302 --> 01:08:46,894
That's more like it.

706
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:49,438
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- I'm planning on it.

707
01:08:49,506 --> 01:08:51,599
- Suppose Jacques doesn't go to Brunico?
- Not a chance.

708
01:08:51,675 --> 01:08:53,700
Suppose he finds out the prefect
never really called him?

709
01:08:53,777 --> 01:08:56,575
-Stop this. You must get out of here.
-You are the damnedest woman I ever met.

710
01:08:56,646 --> 01:08:58,671
What are you? A sexual yo-yo?
First you jump in my bed.

711
01:08:58,748 --> 01:09:01,774
Then you push me off a mountain. Then
you almost seduce me on the dance floor.

712
01:09:01,852 --> 01:09:05,151
You're terribly attractive,
and I'm naturally--

713
01:09:05,222 --> 01:09:07,156
- But not here.
- Where?

714
01:09:07,224 --> 01:09:08,987
I don't know, but not tonight.

715
01:09:09,059 --> 01:09:11,425
You know what your trouble is?
You just can't make up your mind.

716
01:09:11,495 --> 01:09:13,486
- I am married.
- Where's your husband?

717
01:09:13,563 --> 01:09:15,497
Out in 12 feet of snow,
chasing the Phantom.

718
01:09:15,565 --> 01:09:17,157
- That was your idea.
- Sure it was.

719
01:09:17,234 --> 01:09:20,931
But if he was any kind of a man,
he wouldn't have gone.

720
01:09:21,004 --> 01:09:23,564
- Darling.
- Darling?

721
01:09:26,610 --> 01:09:28,544
It's locked.

722
01:09:33,483 --> 01:09:37,283
There you are.
Halfway to Brunico, huh?

723
01:09:37,354 --> 01:09:38,787
Angel?

724
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:47,389
- What do I do?
- Answer the door.

725
01:09:47,464 --> 01:09:49,557
- Simone?
- Yes, dear?

726
01:09:51,801 --> 01:09:55,259
- But, Jacques, I thought you were on--
- That phone call was a ruse.

727
01:09:56,973 --> 01:10:00,136
Oh, dear!
Are you hurt, my darling?

728
01:10:01,745 --> 01:10:03,679
I don't recall that being there.

729
01:10:03,747 --> 01:10:06,716
No, it was sent a while ago.
I thought it was from you.

730
01:10:06,783 --> 01:10:09,308
No, it certainly was not from me.

731
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:13,521
Some very strange things
going on here.

732
01:10:14,758 --> 01:10:16,692
I passed the prefect on the road.

733
01:10:19,062 --> 01:10:21,121
- He never made that call.
- No?

734
01:10:23,767 --> 01:10:25,701
There was no card with these?

735
01:10:29,139 --> 01:10:31,471
Why should anybody want me
to go to Brunico?

736
01:10:33,343 --> 01:10:35,903
Oh, my darling. I'm so sorry.

737
01:10:35,979 --> 01:10:37,913
- I was trying to kiss your foot.
- It's all right.

738
01:10:37,981 --> 01:10:40,040
- Let me kiss your face.
- It's all right.

739
01:10:40,116 --> 01:10:42,243
Darling, I'm sorry.
Come here.

740
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:46,722
That's nice and comfy.
You belong in bed there.

741
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:48,951
- My darling.
- Listen, dear.

742
01:10:49,025 --> 01:10:52,290
Why don't we go down to the bar
and have a nightcap?

743
01:10:52,362 --> 01:10:56,992
Darling, listen,
why don't I have a nice bath?

744
01:10:57,067 --> 01:11:00,059
And afterwards,
we have our lovely, warm bed.

745
01:11:00,136 --> 01:11:02,764
Don't worry about this mess.
We can have it cleaned up later.

746
01:11:02,839 --> 01:11:07,469
- We don't want any more interruptions.
- Would you mind if I bathed first?

747
01:11:07,544 --> 01:11:10,206
Did you not bathe earlier?

748
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:14,683
Y es, I did, but it would warm me up
and help me to relax.

749
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:18,588
All right, my darling.
I'll tell you what we'll do.

750
01:11:18,655 --> 01:11:20,680
Like we did in the old days,
when you're in there...

751
01:11:20,757 --> 01:11:22,691
I will come in and
scrub your back for you.

752
01:11:22,759 --> 01:11:25,353
You're so romantic,
but I'll only be a moment.

753
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,666
- Darling?
- Yes?

754
01:12:47,977 --> 01:12:51,469
- Hello, my darling.
- Hello, my darling.

755
01:12:51,548 --> 01:12:55,075
- Why did you draw the curtains?
- Just to keep me warm.

756
01:12:55,151 --> 01:12:58,416
Warm? Warm is one thing.
It must be hell in there.

757
01:12:58,488 --> 01:13:00,786
No, it's wonderful.

758
01:13:00,857 --> 01:13:02,848
Why don't you let me
wash your back for you?

759
01:13:02,926 --> 01:13:07,329
It's already done, darling. As I told
you before, I just want to relax.

760
01:13:07,397 --> 01:13:09,524
We must have no secrets
from one another, my darling.

761
01:13:09,599 --> 01:13:11,533
I know, my darling.

762
01:13:16,373 --> 01:13:18,364
I will brush my teeth
and keep you company.

763
01:13:18,441 --> 01:13:20,432
That's sweet of you, my darling.

764
01:13:34,924 --> 01:13:36,016
Hello?

765
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:41,494
I thought you would like to know
Princess Dala has just checked out.

766
01:13:41,564 --> 01:13:43,759
Thank you very much.

767
01:13:46,236 --> 01:13:49,569
Darling, you got rid
of all those naughty little bubbles?

768
01:13:49,639 --> 01:13:52,073
- I beg your pardon?
- You got rid of those little bubbles?

769
01:13:52,142 --> 01:13:53,575
Y es, I did.

770
01:13:58,615 --> 01:14:00,173
Hey, come--

771
01:14:01,151 --> 01:14:03,278
Come out quick.

772
01:14:10,927 --> 01:14:13,157
- Who is it?
- Bellboy.

773
01:14:13,229 --> 01:14:15,163
One minute.

774
01:14:16,733 --> 01:14:17,825
Y es?

775
01:14:17,901 --> 01:14:20,062
- lnspector's violin, ma'am.
- Thank you.

776
01:14:20,136 --> 01:14:23,299
- Madame, the flowers.
- It's nothing. It doesn't matter.

777
01:14:23,373 --> 01:14:25,637
If they found out downstairs,
I'd lose my job.

778
01:14:25,708 --> 01:14:28,609
- Do it in the morning.
- I'll ring for the maid.

779
01:14:39,989 --> 01:14:41,581
- Darling?
- Yes, dear?

780
01:14:41,658 --> 01:14:45,253
- How would you like to wash my back?
- I'd love to, but you see--

781
01:14:45,328 --> 01:14:48,593
I have to-- I mean--
Well, I'm cold.

782
01:14:55,205 --> 01:14:58,174
Get the broom.

783
01:15:01,978 --> 01:15:04,845
Come on. Hurry up. Go.

784
01:15:18,561 --> 01:15:21,359
Shan't be a moment, my darling.
I'll just put on my pajamas.

785
01:15:21,431 --> 01:15:24,798
Darling, look. I think
I've got something in my right eye.

786
01:15:24,868 --> 01:15:27,098
- Let me put you in the--
- I mean, my left one. No, this one.

787
01:15:27,170 --> 01:15:30,003
- If you'd come in the light--
- It hurts!

788
01:15:30,073 --> 01:15:33,668
- Stand still. I can't see it.
- It hurts. I cannot open it.

789
01:15:33,743 --> 01:15:37,804
- Stand in the light a moment. Where?
- Here.

790
01:15:37,881 --> 01:15:41,078
-There's absolutely nothing in your eye.
-Nothing? Are you sure?

791
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:44,085
Only your eye.
That is all that is there.

792
01:15:53,963 --> 01:15:56,295
- What are you doing?
- It broke off.

793
01:15:56,366 --> 01:15:59,028
Put it back. We have no time.
He's coming back.

794
01:15:59,102 --> 01:16:01,900
Get under the bed.
Come on. Quick.

795
01:16:04,274 --> 01:16:05,866
Come on.

796
01:16:08,344 --> 01:16:13,441
- Why aren't you in bed, my darling?
- I was-- I mean--

797
01:16:13,516 --> 01:16:16,485
I mean, I'm just going to.

798
01:16:18,555 --> 01:16:20,022
I'm cold.

799
01:16:21,057 --> 01:16:25,221
- My Stradivarius.
- The porter just brought it in.

800
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:31,057
I sent it to the village to be repaired.
I hope they know how to fix plastic.

801
01:16:31,134 --> 01:16:32,999
I hope so too.

802
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:36,732
So far, so good.

803
01:16:36,806 --> 01:16:38,740
We shall see.

804
01:16:43,346 --> 01:16:44,904
Better than ever.

805
01:16:45,982 --> 01:16:48,678
Dear, I doubt if we shall
need it tonight, my love.

806
01:16:48,751 --> 01:16:51,879
I'm sure we won't, darling.

807
01:17:08,571 --> 01:17:09,663
What?

808
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:13,367
It's very strange.

809
01:17:26,556 --> 01:17:29,457
Why don't you come to bed?

810
01:17:29,525 --> 01:17:31,652
You know,
I don't understand this.

811
01:17:33,229 --> 01:17:34,662
You see...

812
01:17:35,865 --> 01:17:39,767
these footprints...

813
01:17:39,836 --> 01:17:44,705
they were made by shoes...

814
01:17:44,774 --> 01:17:48,972
and they were not
made by feet.

815
01:17:55,018 --> 01:17:57,578
I'll just get up
and turn off the lights.

816
01:18:02,558 --> 01:18:05,391
At last. At last.

817
01:18:05,461 --> 01:18:07,429
Darling, my little--

818
01:18:10,767 --> 01:18:13,235
Darling, what's the matter,
my darling?

819
01:18:13,302 --> 01:18:17,295
It's very strange, my love,
but suddenly I'm freezing cold.

820
01:18:17,373 --> 01:18:21,002
- You're freezing cold?
- The window is open.

821
01:18:21,077 --> 01:18:25,207
The window's open. Sometimes
it's healthy to have fresh air.

822
01:18:25,281 --> 01:18:29,012
Healthy is one thing,
but it's hell in here, my love.

823
01:18:29,986 --> 01:18:32,284
Ten below zero outside, my darling.

824
01:18:36,826 --> 01:18:38,088
That's better.

825
01:18:45,935 --> 01:18:47,869
- There, my darling.
- Yes?

826
01:18:51,974 --> 01:18:53,407
At last!

827
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:19,268
- Yes?
- I just arrived in town.

828
01:19:19,335 --> 01:19:21,303
No trouble with the police yet.

829
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:24,396
I understand the princess is expecting
important visitors here tomorrow.

830
01:19:24,474 --> 01:19:27,204
- She say anything about leaving?
- Who is this?

831
01:19:41,057 --> 01:19:43,582
- Y es?
- Princess Dala, please.

832
01:19:43,659 --> 01:19:46,822
Her Highness checked out
a short while ago.

833
01:20:59,969 --> 01:21:01,800
Uncle Charles.

834
01:21:38,741 --> 01:21:40,436
What did you say?

835
01:21:40,509 --> 01:21:42,443
I said he could come
as one of the Borgias.

836
01:21:42,511 --> 01:21:44,479
Then he wouldn't have
to explain his cousin.

837
01:21:44,547 --> 01:21:47,038
What's a Borgia?

838
01:21:49,552 --> 01:21:50,985
Good evening.

839
01:21:59,762 --> 01:22:01,889
I mean--

840
01:22:01,964 --> 01:22:05,229
I enjoy champagne in bed
as much as the next man, my angel.

841
01:22:05,301 --> 01:22:09,397
But from now on, perhaps
a more practical approach?

842
01:22:09,472 --> 01:22:13,875
I'm sorry, my darling. I just
wanted to surprise you. That's all.

843
01:22:13,943 --> 01:22:17,879
- It's been a night of surprises.
- You can say that again.

844
01:22:17,947 --> 01:22:19,380
It's been--

845
01:22:21,417 --> 01:22:23,612
Anyway, anyway--

846
01:22:23,686 --> 01:22:25,517
- My love?
- Yes?

847
01:22:28,124 --> 01:22:30,092
Shall I say you're not here?

848
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:34,093
No, it's all right, darling.
I'll answer it.

849
01:22:42,872 --> 01:22:45,739
- Yes!
- Oh, Tucker here, lnspector.

850
01:22:45,808 --> 01:22:49,073
The man who kidnapped the dog
was driving a rented car.

851
01:22:49,145 --> 01:22:51,773
He's been identified
as a man named Artoff.

852
01:22:51,847 --> 01:22:55,010
Now, London informs us
that a man of his description...

853
01:22:55,084 --> 01:22:57,780
is at present employed
by Sir Charles Lytton.

854
01:22:57,853 --> 01:23:00,151
I see. Come up immediately.

855
01:23:00,222 --> 01:23:01,712
- Sir Charles!
- Sir Charles?

856
01:23:01,791 --> 01:23:05,557
He's the Phantom!
I've really got him this time.

857
01:23:19,041 --> 01:23:22,101
Sir Charles?
Open that door.

858
01:23:22,178 --> 01:23:26,774
I know you're in there, Sir Charles.
Open up. This is the police.

859
01:23:26,849 --> 01:23:30,307
- Stand back while I fire.
- No, don't do that, old man.

860
01:23:43,866 --> 01:23:45,231
Jacques knows.

861
01:23:45,301 --> 01:23:49,067
And somebody else. George has
got my do-it-yourself Phantom kit.

862
01:23:49,138 --> 01:23:51,766
I've got to get out of here.

863
01:23:51,841 --> 01:23:55,436
- Well, his clothes are still here.
- Perhaps he's already escaped.

864
01:23:55,511 --> 01:23:58,105
Most unlikely. He doesn't realize
that I am onto him.

865
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:59,772
Now, listen, old man.

866
01:23:59,849 --> 01:24:03,546
After all, we've no proof that Artoff
was the man driving the lnnocente.

867
01:24:03,619 --> 01:24:06,679
Sir Charles is our man.
My every instinct tells me so.

868
01:24:06,756 --> 01:24:08,849
Careful, you fool.
You realize this gun is loaded?

869
01:24:08,924 --> 01:24:12,257
What I must do now is get dressed
and search the rest of the hotel.

870
01:24:20,236 --> 01:24:22,204
- Did you find him?
- No, but he can't be far.

871
01:24:22,271 --> 01:24:25,263
I must dress quickly and get--

872
01:24:28,711 --> 01:24:30,201
- It's gone.
- What's gone?

873
01:24:30,279 --> 01:24:31,610
My coat!

874
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:34,478
My Surete-Scotland-Yard-type
macintosh! It's gone!

875
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:36,677
Good evening, lnspector.

876
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:17,554
- What is it, Saloud?
- lnspector Clouseau.

877
01:25:20,996 --> 01:25:23,396
Your Highness, please
excuse this interruption.

878
01:25:23,466 --> 01:25:27,869
I have news of great importance.
This is Mr. Tucker of Lloyds of London.

879
01:25:27,937 --> 01:25:32,340
- And we have met before.
- I've met her, too, you know.

880
01:25:32,408 --> 01:25:34,740
Yes, I know, but
we are meeting her again now.

881
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:36,801
What is this news?

882
01:25:36,879 --> 01:25:40,144
Your Highness, I have discovered
the identity of the Phantom.

883
01:25:40,216 --> 01:25:42,241
- You don't say.
- I do say.

884
01:25:42,318 --> 01:25:44,252
- Of course, we're not positive.
- I am positive.

885
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,311
He is, I believe,
at this very moment here in Rome.

886
01:25:46,388 --> 01:25:48,356
- Really?
- Yes.

887
01:25:48,424 --> 01:25:50,824
Have you seen or heard
from Sir Charles Lytton?

888
01:25:50,893 --> 01:25:53,487
Not since I left Cortina. Why?

889
01:25:53,562 --> 01:25:56,224
Sir Charles and the Phantom
are one and the same.

890
01:25:56,298 --> 01:25:59,392
- You're not serious.
- I am serious.

891
01:25:59,468 --> 01:26:03,632
I can understand how difficult it is
for Your Highness to accept the facts.

892
01:26:03,706 --> 01:26:07,005
Sir Charles is a very
persuasive and attractive man.

893
01:26:07,076 --> 01:26:11,137
He is also Sir Charles Lytton, a man of
considerable influence and reputation.

894
01:26:11,213 --> 01:26:13,147
She's got quite
a point there, you know.

895
01:26:13,215 --> 01:26:16,013
He is a fraud,
and I shall prove it.

896
01:26:16,085 --> 01:26:19,919
Meanwhile, I would like your permission
to surround the house with armed guards.

897
01:26:19,989 --> 01:26:22,753
- I take it the gem is in the villa.
- It is.

898
01:26:22,825 --> 01:26:25,555
But as you gentlemen know, I'm having
a rather large party this evening.

899
01:26:25,628 --> 01:26:29,394
I assure you, your guests will
be caused no embarrassment whatsoever.

900
01:26:29,465 --> 01:26:33,094
They will not even be aware that my men
are present in their disguises.

901
01:26:33,169 --> 01:26:35,137
In that case,
you have my permission.

902
01:26:35,204 --> 01:26:36,637
Thank you.

903
01:26:48,517 --> 01:26:51,452
Your Highness, mark my words...

904
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:55,980
if Sir Charles is foolish enough to
attempt to steal your diamond tonight...

905
01:26:56,058 --> 01:27:00,552
you will be witness to the capture
of the notorious Phantom.

906
01:27:02,064 --> 01:27:03,497
Gentlemen.

907
01:27:20,516 --> 01:27:24,247
- The plans will have to be changed.
- No.

908
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:28,586
We just have to make sure that
Sir Charles doesn't steal the jewel.

909
01:28:19,375 --> 01:28:21,309
- Hello.
- Hello, Tucker.

910
01:28:21,377 --> 01:28:22,844
- Like a drink?
- No, thank you.

911
01:28:22,911 --> 01:28:25,880
I never drink whilst I'm on duty.
You should know that. Never, never.

912
01:28:25,948 --> 01:28:28,348
- Oh, well, cheers.
- Cheers.

913
01:28:28,417 --> 01:28:32,410
- Warm.
- Yes, it must be hell in there.

914
01:28:32,488 --> 01:28:35,355
Bet it's not so good in there.

915
01:28:35,424 --> 01:28:39,690
- Anything suspicious?
- No, nothing to worry about.

916
01:28:39,762 --> 01:28:42,287
My men are everywhere,
mingling here, mingling there.

917
01:28:42,364 --> 01:28:44,423
Watching all the time, watching.

918
01:28:50,439 --> 01:28:53,602
How dare you drink whilst on duty!
Who is inside there?

919
01:28:53,676 --> 01:28:55,803
- Sergeant Walter!
- Sergeant Quinn.

920
01:28:55,878 --> 01:28:58,142
Any more behavior like this,
and I'll have your stripes.

921
01:28:58,213 --> 01:29:01,376
Now get out of here
and start mingling again.

922
01:29:04,753 --> 01:29:07,085
That's funny.
That zebra and the stripes?

923
01:29:07,156 --> 01:29:11,889
- Y es, very good, very good.
- Not bad, not bad.

924
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:14,485
Well, I think I'll mingle.

925
01:29:14,563 --> 01:29:15,996
Right.

926
01:29:31,914 --> 01:29:35,213
Didn't I tell you that I'd make this
the biggest social success of the year?

927
01:29:35,284 --> 01:29:36,876
Certainly you did.

928
01:29:36,952 --> 01:29:40,581
The only thing that worries me is, of
course, what do we do for your next one?

929
01:29:40,656 --> 01:29:44,854
- How can I possibly top this?
- I'm sure you'll think of something.

930
01:29:44,927 --> 01:29:47,657
- Excuse me.
- Of course, love. Have a ball!

931
01:29:47,730 --> 01:29:49,027
Hello, you!

932
01:29:52,568 --> 01:29:54,160
May I see
your invitation, please?

933
01:29:56,004 --> 01:29:57,437
All right.

934
01:30:04,179 --> 01:30:06,704
Wasn't there another gorilla
in a Rolls-Royce?

935
01:30:06,782 --> 01:30:08,943
Y es, probably a rich uncle.

936
01:30:10,652 --> 01:30:13,314
You see, gentlemen?
Perfectly safe.

937
01:30:13,389 --> 01:30:17,689
One cannot be too careful. This party--
All your guests wearing masks.

938
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:21,161
It was just possible that the Phantom
had already done his work.

939
01:30:21,230 --> 01:30:25,064
Without an invitation, how could
Sir Charles get past your guards?

940
01:30:25,134 --> 01:30:27,932
Where the Phantom is concerned,
Your Highness--

941
01:30:29,872 --> 01:30:31,305
What's wrong?

942
01:30:43,485 --> 01:30:45,646
- What are you doing?
- The question is, what are you doing?

943
01:30:45,721 --> 01:30:49,054
- I protest!
- Remove your head at once!

944
01:30:49,124 --> 01:30:51,217
Tucker, remove his head.

945
01:30:55,297 --> 01:30:58,494
- Oh, good grief. It's our ambassador.
- Ambassador?

946
01:30:58,567 --> 01:31:00,535
My apologies,
Lord Cravenwood.

947
01:31:00,602 --> 01:31:03,002
The inspector was only acting
with the best of motives.

948
01:31:03,071 --> 01:31:04,504
Your Highness.

949
01:31:11,447 --> 01:31:15,645
Oh, really, Lord Cravenwood,
what would your wife think?

950
01:31:20,322 --> 01:31:22,415
- What's he got that I haven't got?
- George!

951
01:31:22,491 --> 01:31:24,550
- In the flesh.
- What are you doing here?

952
01:31:24,626 --> 01:31:27,959
- Tarzan let me use the car tonight.
- Listen, I've got to talk to you.

953
01:31:28,030 --> 01:31:32,399
You've got to get out of here--
Oh, darling.

954
01:31:32,468 --> 01:31:35,369
Lord Cravenwood, I'm so terribly
sorry about what happened.

955
01:31:35,437 --> 01:31:37,496
You see, I was discussing
important things with Her Highness...

956
01:31:37,573 --> 01:31:41,509
and when I discovered you outside
the library door, naturally, I thought--

957
01:31:45,347 --> 01:31:47,542
- The ambassador.
- Y es, I know.

958
01:31:47,616 --> 01:31:50,176
You know, darling, you haven't
danced with me all evening, my angel.

959
01:31:50,252 --> 01:31:54,916
- Oh, I'm sorry, my darling.
- That's all for now.

960
01:31:59,561 --> 01:32:02,189
Pardon me! I'm lost.

961
01:32:02,264 --> 01:32:06,860
I must have gotten off the main road.
I'm on my way to Frascati.

962
01:32:06,935 --> 01:32:10,769
You'll have to go down the road
about a half mile. You'll see a sign.

963
01:32:10,839 --> 01:32:13,831
Turn right. It'll take you
right to the highway.

964
01:32:33,295 --> 01:32:36,696
Excuse me, dear, but I've got to talk
to Lord Cravenwood. It's very important.

965
01:32:36,765 --> 01:32:38,960
That's okay.
He's making me itch anyway.

966
01:32:39,034 --> 01:32:40,467
Fine.

967
01:32:41,537 --> 01:32:45,029
Now, listen to me. I know what
you're up to, and it won't work.

968
01:32:45,107 --> 01:32:47,701
- You'll ruin everything.
- Excuse me, Your Excellency.

969
01:32:47,776 --> 01:32:50,609
May I cut in?
Thank you so much, sir.

970
01:32:50,679 --> 01:32:52,613
- Are you having a good time?
- Yes.

971
01:32:52,681 --> 01:32:54,273
- Extremely good time.
- Good.

972
01:33:55,877 --> 01:33:58,038
Fine party, Angela darling.

973
01:33:58,113 --> 01:34:01,139
Wait till you see
the fireworks at midnight.

974
01:34:32,147 --> 01:34:35,048
Hello, old boy.
May I have this dance?

975
01:34:36,618 --> 01:34:40,213
I never learned to dance. I've simply
got natural rhythm, you know.

976
01:34:40,288 --> 01:34:41,880
You're quite right.

977
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:48,496
By Jove, that looked--
It is! It's Sir Charles!

978
01:34:55,504 --> 01:34:56,937
Tucker!

979
01:34:59,508 --> 01:35:02,477
- lnspector!
- Tucker!

980
01:35:05,981 --> 01:35:07,312
Inspector!

981
01:35:10,485 --> 01:35:13,181
Take your filthy hands
off my asp.

982
01:35:17,893 --> 01:35:19,588
- Charles?
- Where's the safe?

983
01:35:19,661 --> 01:35:21,390
In the library.
George is robbing it.

984
01:35:21,463 --> 01:35:23,090
- Which way?
- Come on.

985
01:35:23,165 --> 01:35:25,963
- But it's not midnight yet.
- They turned the lights out.

986
01:35:26,034 --> 01:35:28,002
Her Highness must have
changed her mind.

987
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:30,163
All right.

988
01:35:30,238 --> 01:35:32,138
Be careful.
I can't see a thing.

989
01:35:32,207 --> 01:35:34,801
Tucker? Where are you?

990
01:35:36,812 --> 01:35:38,746
Watch where you're going!

991
01:35:53,295 --> 01:35:55,229
It's hell in here.

992
01:36:01,770 --> 01:36:03,203
A candle!

993
01:36:05,407 --> 01:36:07,932
- Hey, quick, got a match?
- Oh, yes, sir.

994
01:36:08,009 --> 01:36:10,000
Quick, quick.

995
01:36:29,064 --> 01:36:30,895
What kind of a candle is this?

996
01:36:37,706 --> 01:36:39,640
In there. George
is in the gorilla suit.

997
01:36:39,708 --> 01:36:41,733
- Gorilla?
- Good luck.

998
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:46,805
Rule, Britannia

999
01:36:46,882 --> 01:36:49,009
Britannia, rule the waves

1000
01:36:49,084 --> 01:36:53,077
Britons never, never, never
shall be slaves

1001
01:36:53,155 --> 01:36:55,385
Oh, rule, Britannia

1002
01:36:55,457 --> 01:36:57,049
Britannia, rule the waves

1003
01:36:57,125 --> 01:36:59,855
Oh, I say!

1004
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:16,477
Inspector! Inspector!
Oh, lnspector, Sir Charles is here.

1005
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:07,277
- George?
- Uncle Charles?

1006
01:40:07,349 --> 01:40:09,283
- Have you got it?
- No, haven't you?

1007
01:40:09,351 --> 01:40:11,478
No, the safe's empty.

1008
01:40:14,122 --> 01:40:15,851
What's that?

1009
01:40:20,962 --> 01:40:22,896
Someone's being highly dishonest.

1010
01:40:22,964 --> 01:40:24,295
Follow me, men.

1011
01:40:28,003 --> 01:40:29,994
You idiots!
They're getting away from us!

1012
01:40:30,071 --> 01:40:34,303
Help me to my feet, someone.
Mr. Tucker! Mr. Tucker!

1013
01:40:34,376 --> 01:40:37,402
After them! Come on, Tucker!

1014
01:41:02,871 --> 01:41:04,600
Come back! It's me!

1015
01:42:00,929 --> 01:42:03,591
Come on now!
Faster! Faster!

1016
01:42:05,433 --> 01:42:09,164
Hurry! What's the matter with you?
Can't you drive this thing faster?

1017
01:42:20,782 --> 01:42:23,683
Tucker, you're wrong.
Come on! Quick!

1018
01:42:23,751 --> 01:42:27,414
I tell you, this is the road
they've gone up.

1019
01:42:27,489 --> 01:42:30,583
Don't argue with me! I'm telling you,
I know where they've gone.

1020
01:42:42,837 --> 01:42:44,805
Now, George, any idea
how we get out of here?

1021
01:42:44,873 --> 01:42:46,807
I don't know.
I've been all over this place.

1022
01:42:46,875 --> 01:42:49,639
I've been up this street, up that one,
that one. How we gonna get out of here?

1023
01:42:49,711 --> 01:42:51,645
Why don't you try the high road?

1024
01:42:51,713 --> 01:42:53,806
I'll take the high road.
You take the low road.

1025
01:42:53,882 --> 01:42:55,816
- So long, Uncle Charles.
- Ciao, George.

1026
01:43:29,217 --> 01:43:31,208
Who taught you
to drive this thing?

1027
01:43:43,164 --> 01:43:47,066
- I see them! That's them!
- No, it isn't!

1028
01:44:19,767 --> 01:44:25,205
Then when I was thrown out of college,
I made up my mind.

1029
01:44:25,273 --> 01:44:28,800
I decided to live a little.

1030
01:44:28,876 --> 01:44:31,071
I knew if I continued
my academic endeavors...

1031
01:44:31,145 --> 01:44:33,705
I could depend upon
that check of yours every month.

1032
01:44:33,781 --> 01:44:37,547
You know what I did?
I took a plush Hollywood apartment.

1033
01:44:37,619 --> 01:44:42,420
Surrounded myself with all of
the advantages of a wealthy bachelor.

1034
01:44:42,490 --> 01:44:45,891
Then I sent you glowing reports
of a brilliant academic career.

1035
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:48,121
I suppose a certain
amount of dishonesty...

1036
01:44:48,196 --> 01:44:50,562
is bound to beget
a certain amount of dishonesty.

1037
01:44:55,169 --> 01:44:57,330
- Hey.
- But, lnspector--

1038
01:44:57,405 --> 01:44:59,873
Come on, please.
I have not much time.

1039
01:45:21,863 --> 01:45:23,854
Better be right this time.

1040
01:45:27,802 --> 01:45:29,861
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, lnspector.

1041
01:45:29,937 --> 01:45:31,905
- Good morning, lnspector.
- Everything all sharp and shiny?

1042
01:45:33,474 --> 01:45:36,068
Just thought you'd like to know the
trial is all set for tomorrow morning.

1043
01:45:36,144 --> 01:45:38,908
- Shouldn't take too long.
- Well, that sounds encouraging.

1044
01:45:38,980 --> 01:45:43,440
Y es, it's encouraging for me,
but bad for you.

1045
01:45:43,518 --> 01:45:44,985
Have some coffee, lnspector.

1046
01:45:45,053 --> 01:45:48,750
You could save yourself a lot of trouble
if you would tell me where the jewel is.

1047
01:45:48,823 --> 01:45:51,815
Pack in some of that porridge.
It's guaranteed good for sleuthing.

1048
01:45:51,893 --> 01:45:55,090
- You refuse to cooperate?
- We've offered coffee and porridge.

1049
01:45:55,163 --> 01:45:58,758
- It's all that's left.
- I'm glad you're enjoying yourselves.

1050
01:45:58,833 --> 01:46:03,702
Because you're going to be here
for the next 20 years--

1051
01:46:15,683 --> 01:46:17,116
Madame Clouseau.

1052
01:46:21,689 --> 01:46:24,180
- Your Highness.
- Madame.

1053
01:46:24,258 --> 01:46:26,886
Won't you sit down?

1054
01:46:29,063 --> 01:46:30,997
I'll be brief and to the point.

1055
01:46:31,065 --> 01:46:33,124
My husband feels
he has enough evidence...

1056
01:46:33,201 --> 01:46:35,192
to prove that Sir Charles
is the Phantom...

1057
01:46:35,269 --> 01:46:37,260
and to convict George
as his accomplish.

1058
01:46:37,338 --> 01:46:40,273
As I see it,
they only have one chance.

1059
01:46:40,341 --> 01:46:42,332
What is that?

1060
01:46:42,410 --> 01:46:45,345
If Your Highness were
to testify on their behalf--

1061
01:46:45,413 --> 01:46:49,509
Somehow convince the jury that
they didn't even take the diamond.

1062
01:46:49,584 --> 01:46:52,519
- You surprise me, madame.
- I expect to.

1063
01:46:52,587 --> 01:46:56,887
I'm taking the chance you will keep what
I'm about to tell you in confidence.

1064
01:46:56,958 --> 01:47:01,361
- I think I can guess.
- It's not too difficult.

1065
01:47:01,429 --> 01:47:03,624
Being the wife
of lnspector Clouseau...

1066
01:47:03,698 --> 01:47:06,667
you could have been
very helpful to Charles.

1067
01:47:07,735 --> 01:47:09,293
I have been.

1068
01:47:10,037 --> 01:47:12,801
Was stealing my dog
all part of the plan?

1069
01:47:12,874 --> 01:47:15,900
That was the plan.

1070
01:47:15,977 --> 01:47:19,310
But I think you should know
that Charles wanted to call it off.

1071
01:47:44,205 --> 01:47:46,139
You've had it all the time.

1072
01:47:46,207 --> 01:47:49,608
You stole the jewel yourself before the
lnternational Court made its decision.

1073
01:47:49,677 --> 01:47:54,080
I'd gladly sacrifice it to save Charles,
but it's not so simple.

1074
01:47:54,148 --> 01:47:56,844
Couldn't you say you found it
on the grounds or something?

1075
01:47:56,918 --> 01:48:00,251
They'd just claim he dropped it
making his escape.

1076
01:48:00,321 --> 01:48:03,950
No, to save Charles, we must prove
that someone else stole it.

1077
01:48:04,025 --> 01:48:05,959
But we'd never
be able to do that.

1078
01:48:07,395 --> 01:48:09,420
I have an idea.

1079
01:48:12,066 --> 01:48:14,466
The trial is in its third day.

1080
01:48:14,535 --> 01:48:16,560
Seldom in the history
of ltalian jurisprudence...

1081
01:48:16,637 --> 01:48:19,435
has a trial created
such intense excitement.

1082
01:48:19,507 --> 01:48:22,670
Thousands of people-- It is interesting
to note, most of them women--

1083
01:48:22,743 --> 01:48:26,372
have gathered daily hoping to catch
a glimpse of Sir Charles Lytton...

1084
01:48:26,447 --> 01:48:29,280
the man accused of being
the notorious Phantom.

1085
01:48:29,350 --> 01:48:32,183
The court adjourned yesterday
as the defense requested time...

1086
01:48:32,253 --> 01:48:34,744
to investigate certain
new important evidence...

1087
01:48:34,822 --> 01:48:37,848
and it is rumored that
when the court convenes today...

1088
01:48:37,925 --> 01:48:40,655
the defense will call
a surprise witness.

1089
01:48:40,728 --> 01:48:43,492
The defense has only one witness,
Mr. President.

1090
01:48:43,564 --> 01:48:46,158
Would you please call
lnspector Jacques Clouseau to the stand?

1091
01:48:48,202 --> 01:48:49,635
Me, a defense witness?

1092
01:48:50,705 --> 01:48:52,172
Inspector Clouseau?

1093
01:48:52,240 --> 01:48:55,539
Nothing to worry about, my darling.
You'll make fools out of them.

1094
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:09,055
Inspector Clouseau,
you have testified under oath...

1095
01:49:09,123 --> 01:49:12,923
to certain pertinent facts
concerning this case.

1096
01:49:12,994 --> 01:49:14,928
Your testimony
and your testimony alone...

1097
01:49:14,996 --> 01:49:18,955
has been the major factor in casting
suspicion on the defendant.

1098
01:49:19,033 --> 01:49:23,629
Aside from the Phantom himself, you are
the foremost authority on the Phantom.

1099
01:49:25,339 --> 01:49:28,331
I have made
the Phantom my life's work.

1100
01:49:28,409 --> 01:49:31,435
You've testified that the Phantom
has been a frequent guest...

1101
01:49:31,512 --> 01:49:33,980
at the numerous parties
given by Miss Angela Dunning.

1102
01:49:34,048 --> 01:49:35,640
That is correct. Yes.

1103
01:49:35,716 --> 01:49:40,210
You've testified it was either
during or sometime soon afterwards...

1104
01:49:40,288 --> 01:49:43,382
that certain of Miss Dunning's guests
were robbed of their jewels.

1105
01:49:43,457 --> 01:49:44,549
Yes.

1106
01:49:46,093 --> 01:49:49,290
- How many times did this happen?
- Sixteen.

1107
01:49:49,363 --> 01:49:52,560
- Sixteen parties, 16 thefts?
- Y es.

1108
01:49:52,633 --> 01:49:56,069
- And Sir Charles attended all 16?
- All of them.

1109
01:49:56,137 --> 01:49:58,731
And how many of those parties
did you attend, lnspector?

1110
01:50:00,141 --> 01:50:04,601
- All of them.
- Oh, that's very interesting.

1111
01:50:06,013 --> 01:50:08,277
You attended the first party
when the jewels were stolen?

1112
01:50:08,349 --> 01:50:09,941
Y es.

1113
01:50:10,017 --> 01:50:13,919
The jewels were stolen
during or after the party?

1114
01:50:13,988 --> 01:50:15,250
After.

1115
01:50:15,323 --> 01:50:17,883
- You knew they were going to be stolen?
- Well, yes.

1116
01:50:17,959 --> 01:50:21,861
- How did you know?
- That is the Phantom's modus operandi.

1117
01:50:21,929 --> 01:50:23,897
He always works that way.

1118
01:50:24,832 --> 01:50:26,094
Oh, I see.

1119
01:50:28,436 --> 01:50:31,803
Were the same people
always present at each party?

1120
01:50:31,872 --> 01:50:35,000
No, the guest lists varied.

1121
01:50:35,076 --> 01:50:40,446
Outside of Sir Charles, was anybody else
always present at each of these parties?

1122
01:50:42,783 --> 01:50:47,846
Only Sir Charles was present
at each party when there was a robbery?

1123
01:50:47,922 --> 01:50:51,619
- Y es, yes.
- I see.

1124
01:50:51,692 --> 01:50:54,286
- And what about you?
- Me?

1125
01:50:54,362 --> 01:50:57,559
- Y es, you.
- What about me?

1126
01:50:57,632 --> 01:50:59,657
- Well, you were there.
- Yes.

1127
01:50:59,734 --> 01:51:01,793
Then Sir Charles was not the only one
who was present at each party.

1128
01:51:03,771 --> 01:51:08,299
- What are you suggesting?
- I'm not suggesting anything yet.

1129
01:51:12,446 --> 01:51:14,243
Inspector Clouseau?

1130
01:51:15,316 --> 01:51:17,079
How much money do you make?

1131
01:51:19,153 --> 01:51:21,951
- What does this got to do with it?
- Well, your salary--

1132
01:51:22,023 --> 01:51:25,288
- How much does an inspector get paid?
- You know, l--

1133
01:51:25,359 --> 01:51:29,352
Enough to buy a wife
a $10,000 mink coat?

1134
01:51:29,430 --> 01:51:31,057
No, of course not.

1135
01:51:31,132 --> 01:51:34,624
You're aware that your wife spent $7,000
at Yves St. Laurent only last month?

1136
01:51:36,037 --> 01:51:37,299
What?

1137
01:51:37,371 --> 01:51:41,307
- And two months before that, $4,000.
- That's impossible.

1138
01:51:41,375 --> 01:51:45,778
We know for a fact your wife spent at
least $30,000 on clothes the past year.

1139
01:51:45,846 --> 01:51:50,442
Sir, my wife is very frugal.
She saves out of the housekeeping money.

1140
01:51:55,556 --> 01:51:58,582
$30,000 out of
the housekeeping money.

1141
01:51:58,659 --> 01:52:00,593
We have been
married for ten years.

1142
01:52:03,264 --> 01:52:05,289
About the time that
these robberies began...

1143
01:52:05,366 --> 01:52:07,994
and the notorious Phantom
came into existence, correct?

1144
01:52:08,069 --> 01:52:10,503
Y es! No, not correct!

1145
01:52:10,571 --> 01:52:13,563
Of course, not correct.
Of course--

1146
01:52:13,641 --> 01:52:17,304
All right, wait, wait.
You see--

1147
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:22,943
- It's not Sir Charles!
- He must be the Phantom!

1148
01:52:23,017 --> 01:52:27,545
- It must be the inspector.
- He's the Phantom!

1149
01:52:27,621 --> 01:52:31,022
- I refuse to believe--
- Now, lnspec--

1150
01:52:56,784 --> 01:52:59,309
No, I'm not the Phantom!
No, no, please! Please!

1151
01:53:08,596 --> 01:53:11,326
- Thank you, darling.
- Thank the princess.

1152
01:53:11,398 --> 01:53:14,731
- Look at that.
- No, no! I'm not the Phantom!

1153
01:53:14,802 --> 01:53:16,599
No, no, no!
I'm not the Phantom!

1154
01:53:17,605 --> 01:53:19,573
We can't just let him rot in prison.

1155
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:21,574
Oh, it takes years
for people to rot.

1156
01:53:21,642 --> 01:53:25,806
Besides, when the Phantom strikes again,
the inspector will be as free as a bird.

1157
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:28,314
Want to come to South America, George?
Family rates?

1158
01:53:28,382 --> 01:53:30,577
- I wouldn't miss it, Uncle Charles.
- That's good.

1159
01:53:30,651 --> 01:53:34,348
And who knows, when I retire,
you might take over the business.

1160
01:53:47,301 --> 01:53:52,329
Go back! Go home!
Crazy woman.

1161
01:53:52,406 --> 01:53:54,704
She's the one who tried
to tear off all his clothes.

1162
01:53:54,775 --> 01:53:57,801
- My wife.
- Wife?

1163
01:53:57,878 --> 01:54:00,346
You can thank my mother
for the flowers.

1164
01:54:00,414 --> 01:54:04,111
You're a national hero.
I envy you.

1165
01:54:04,185 --> 01:54:08,622
- I'm going to prison.
- A few years, but after you get out--

1166
01:54:14,762 --> 01:54:16,389
Tell me, lnspector...

1167
01:54:16,463 --> 01:54:18,897
Signor Phantom...

1168
01:54:18,966 --> 01:54:20,991
all those robberies?

1169
01:54:21,068 --> 01:54:23,263
How did you ever manage it?

1170
01:54:26,140 --> 01:54:28,370
Well, you know...

1171
01:54:30,077 --> 01:54:32,011
it wasn't easy.
