00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,990
WILD GRASS

2
00:02:28,495 --> 00:02:31,328
Her feet weren't ordinary.

3
00:02:31,398 --> 00:02:32,763
Because of them,

4
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:37,065
she went where ordinary feet
would never have taken her.

5
00:02:37,737 --> 00:02:41,002
Unable to buy shoes just anywhere,
from just anyone,

6
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:45,534
she had to go
to a shoemaker in Paris, located...

7
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:49,040
I forget the name now.

8
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,976
It's on a street near some pillars.

9
00:02:53,353 --> 00:02:58,552
The incident occurred as she left the shop.

10
00:02:59,326 --> 00:03:00,588
What incident?

11
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,426
Nothing significant, nothing important.

12
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:08,389
A perfectly mundane incident,
something commonplace.

13
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:13,629
But the commonplace and mundane
can lead to...

14
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:17,310
To what? That's what we'll see.

15
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:21,474
It was a beautiful day. The sky was blue.

16
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:24,076
A winter sun.

17
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,983
And she was in Paris to buy shoes.

18
00:03:27,554 --> 00:03:30,387
She hoped to see the girl she liked,

19
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:33,915
whose touch gave her
a vague feeling of pleasure.

20
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:45,628
Choosing, trying... That took time.

21
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:50,039
A matter of color, model, size
that never match.

22
00:03:50,343 --> 00:03:54,746
If you want all those things to match up,

23
00:03:55,615 --> 00:03:59,016
you have to accept, however reluctantly,

24
00:03:59,085 --> 00:04:01,417
to renounce, yield

25
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:04,690
and compromise.

26
00:04:17,671 --> 00:04:22,904
In the end, she chose a pair
close to what she wanted,

27
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:28,539
of a similar color, and which,
above all, fit like a glove.

28
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:30,140
Goodbye.

29
00:04:58,745 --> 00:05:00,007
She nearly cried out.

30
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,240
How about that!

31
00:05:01,314 --> 00:05:03,179
What did she nearly cry?

32
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:05,581
''Stop thief! Stop him!''

33
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:10,385
She thought of it, you know.
One does in such cases.

34
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:14,621
If you drown, you cry out,
''Help! I'm drowning! Save me!''

35
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:17,720
It's ridiculous,
but do we have much choice?

36
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:21,394
We don't even have time
to find words of love ridiculous.

37
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:24,699
We cry out, ''Help! Help me!
I'm being murdered! Murder!''

38
00:05:24,771 --> 00:05:28,332
In fact, the words get stuck.
We don't dare to.

39
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:34,108
We die too scared to call out.
True terror is silent, mouth agape.

40
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:38,116
In short, she didn't dare.

41
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:48,622
She needed money, but she had none left.

42
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:54,623
She had her shoes
and decided to return them.

43
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:58,329
She went back to the shop.

44
00:05:58,405 --> 00:06:03,866
She explained what had occurred.
They understood. It happens.

45
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:06,104
She asked for a refund.

46
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:11,376
She also said
she'd come back for the shoes.

47
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:14,648
Then she thanked them, said goodbye,

48
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:20,417
returned home,
and ran herself an ice-cold bath.

49
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:23,152
It was too cold.

50
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:27,563
She added hot water,
thinking, telling herself...

51
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:29,534
The police station can wait.

52
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:33,299
There are hundreds of thefts every day.

53
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:35,603
Besides, did I really need shoes?

54
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:36,835
No, not really.

55
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,271
Well, yes, I did.

56
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,206
No, I didn't need shoes.

57
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:47,883
It's my fault, it was just a whim, like that.

58
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:51,014
A treat, the way people buy CD's, just to...

59
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:53,116
Come on, calm down.

60
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:56,657
You must declare the theft of

61
00:06:57,931 --> 00:07:01,799
your papers, your checkbook,
your credit cards...

62
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:04,127
I have to call the bank.

63
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:07,199
I'll do all that tomorrow.

64
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:20,114
It's bound to stop in the end, it's worn out.

65
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:23,822
Just like me.

66
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,025
Why don't we stop?

67
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:32,723
I need a new battery.

68
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:34,061
CertainIy.

69
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:40,698
I'm used to it. Let me.

70
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,341
Thank you.

71
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:08,698
She'll mess up the date indicator.

72
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:17,371
-What do I owe you?
-15 euros.

73
00:09:30,717 --> 00:09:32,742
That's how it began.

74
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,645
It might not have begun.

75
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:37,723
He first picked up the wallet.

76
00:09:58,111 --> 00:09:59,976
Name, Muir.

77
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:03,777
First name, Marguerite.
Distinguishing features, none.

78
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:08,252
Address, 8, rue des Ecoles,
Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine.

79
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:11,219
A serious-looking face,

80
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:14,257
a little despondent, sad, even.

81
00:10:15,395 --> 00:10:18,558
You could say sad, a hint of sadness.

82
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:20,724
But it was only a photo...

83
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:23,093
So, sad at that moment.

84
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:30,567
PILOT'S LICENSE - PRIVATE PLANE

85
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:33,435
So different!

86
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:35,478
It can't be the same woman.

87
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:38,848
It is, though. It's the same name.

88
00:10:39,118 --> 00:10:40,779
The same address.

89
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:44,789
In this photo, she's smiling.

90
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,354
A headband...

91
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:51,592
Goggles on her forehead,
as a joke, no doubt.

92
00:10:52,298 --> 00:10:54,391
So she likes to joke.

93
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:57,335
All right. She's a woman,

94
00:10:57,403 --> 00:11:00,668
sad more often than not, with an odd name,

95
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,174
who flies a plane for fun.

96
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:05,239
What can I do with this?

97
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:22,283
We can see her black panties.
What terrible taste!

98
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:24,191
Everything is excusable.

99
00:11:24,263 --> 00:11:26,231
Not everything, not bad taste.

100
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,427
Suddenly, he wanted to touch her.

101
00:11:29,502 --> 00:11:33,666
Then, with a surge of emotion,
he felt like strangling her,

102
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,301
to set her straight, then and there.

103
00:11:37,477 --> 00:11:39,035
The other one, too.

104
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:41,438
Bump both of them off...

105
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:44,881
Bump them off? Yes, rid them of that liking,

106
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:47,078
the foul liking for provoking me.

107
00:11:47,153 --> 00:11:50,281
Just a second.
What on earth are you thinking?

108
00:11:50,356 --> 00:11:53,291
Thinking about that again?
Stop it right now!

109
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:55,725
Stop thinking about it, please!

110
00:11:57,997 --> 00:12:00,557
There, calm down, Georges, pal.

111
00:12:02,301 --> 00:12:04,792
You know what it has cost you in the past.

112
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:07,302
So calm down, all right?

113
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,575
What will I do with her?

114
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,972
I have her name, address,
and so her number,

115
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:20,343
if she has a phone. Of course she has one.

116
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,012
Everybody has a phone.

117
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:25,583
No, not the poor. There are a lot of them.

118
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:29,386
She isn't poor. Flying costs a lot.

119
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:32,689
She'll need to be in the phone book.

120
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:34,426
I hope she is.

121
00:12:34,934 --> 00:12:37,368
I can call her and say...

122
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:39,736
Let's see...

123
00:12:40,973 --> 00:12:42,167
Say to her...

124
00:12:43,443 --> 00:12:46,606
My name

125
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:50,273
is Georges PaIet. Have you Iost something?

126
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:51,882
You have. What?

127
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:55,746
A waIIet. And?

128
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:57,720
No, not that.

129
00:12:58,357 --> 00:13:00,552
Say...

130
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:01,820
I know...

131
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:05,421
My name is Georges PaIet.
Have you Iost something?

132
00:13:05,932 --> 00:13:07,229
You have?

133
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:09,725
HeIIo, I'd Iike to...

134
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:11,326
Or may I, or couId I...

135
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:14,663
Or couId I possibIy...

136
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,105
No, rather...

137
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:18,769
CouId I speak to Marguerite Muir?

138
00:13:18,845 --> 00:13:21,780
No, to Miss Muir. To Miss Marguerite Muir.

139
00:13:22,648 --> 00:13:24,081
Then say to her...

140
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:26,379
I know...

141
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,747
No, I don't know.

142
00:13:29,088 --> 00:13:30,817
I'd Iike to speak to Marguerite Muir.

143
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,619
Speaking?

144
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:35,123
WeII, heIIo, Miss. Madame?

145
00:13:36,395 --> 00:13:38,056
That's what I feared.

146
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:39,991
What?

147
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:42,028
Nothing.

148
00:13:42,802 --> 00:13:44,167
''Who are you?''

149
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:47,805
WeII, my name is...

150
00:13:47,874 --> 00:13:50,900
No, spare her the name. Just tell her...

151
00:13:51,177 --> 00:13:54,203
I'm calling you because...

152
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:56,644
Because what?

153
00:13:56,716 --> 00:13:58,183
Who is this?

154
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,884
Georges had come home to call.

155
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:40,191
He no longer had the right to leave.

156
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:42,420
He had no rights.

157
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:45,396
He couldn't even vote,
but he didn't mind that.

158
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:47,329
What he did mind...

159
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:49,567
No, nothing.

160
00:14:49,635 --> 00:14:50,966
He didn't mind at all.

161
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,138
Well, yes, what he did mind...

162
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:58,571
No, let's not even think about it,
if possible.

163
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:20,464
If only he could have forgotten it.

164
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,597
He wished he could.

165
00:15:23,102 --> 00:15:25,730
He'd waited his whole life

166
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:29,204
to stop thinking at last, about anything.

167
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:31,406
That's what he wanted from her.

168
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:35,572
Thinking of her
was like thinking of nothing.

169
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,962
It's her, my God, it's her!

170
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:35,572
You're dreaming, pal. It can't be her.

171
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:39,134
You fool, she doesn't even know you.

172
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:42,277
For her, you don't even exist.

173
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,977
I've been trying to reach you
for an hour now!

174
00:16:48,054 --> 00:16:49,851
I doubt it, I'm just starting.

175
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:51,987
Starting what?

176
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:56,452
Go on. Starting what?

177
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:57,860
CaIIing.

178
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,022
Calling whom?

179
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,300
-The woman with the waIIet.
-What woman?

180
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:06,496
What waIIet? What is this?

181
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:08,072
I don't know yet.

182
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:10,968
Why did you caII?

183
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:17,410
Something wrong?

184
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:21,219
Don't you feeI weII?

185
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:23,554
Want me to come?

186
00:17:24,357 --> 00:17:27,190
I'm busy, but if you aren't well...

187
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:28,954
If something's wrong, I'll come.

188
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:31,155
There's no need. Why did you caII?

189
00:17:31,297 --> 00:17:33,527
-TeII me first.
-No, you first.

190
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,759
No, you.

191
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:37,299
What woman? What waIIet?

192
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,428
I'II expIain.

193
00:17:38,504 --> 00:17:42,099
No, expIain now. You sound odd.

194
00:17:42,174 --> 00:17:43,869
-Me, odd?
-Yes.

195
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,337
-What's happening?
-Nothing.

196
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:50,982
I went to change my watch battery
and found a waIIet.

197
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,884
I'm trying to caII the girI.
She must be worried.

198
00:17:55,888 --> 00:17:59,255
It's needIing me, see.
I'd Iike to reassure her.

199
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:01,893
But it hasn't been an hour yet.

200
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:04,920
So, why did you caII?

201
00:18:04,997 --> 00:18:06,464
About the lawn.

202
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:10,096
What about the Iawn?

203
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:18,209
The chiIdren are coming on Sunday.

204
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:19,471
I didn't know.

205
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:22,741
I'd Iike you to mow the Iawn.

206
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:35,058
CENTRAL POLICE STATION

207
00:18:58,584 --> 00:18:59,778
Anybody here?

208
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,656
Anybody here?

209
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,198
What are you doing?

210
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:17,095
I caIIed out.

211
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:19,797
Go back to the other side, pIease.

212
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:21,271
Back around the desk.

213
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:28,604
What's it about?

214
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:32,451
CouId you cIose the door?
We can't hear each other.

215
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:39,686
Are you injured? Were you mugged?

216
00:19:40,426 --> 00:19:41,984
To steaI my waIIet?

217
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:43,255
For exampIe.

218
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:47,155
So, were you mugged?

219
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:51,602
No, I disIocated my shouIder
trying to get my mower started.

220
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:55,339
EIectric, eIectric, that's the best.

221
00:19:56,075 --> 00:20:00,478
A wire, a pIug... No nasty smeIIs, no noise.

222
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:04,074
But peopIe get eIectrocuted.

223
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:07,710
They run over the wire, and boom,
or so I've heard.

224
00:20:07,786 --> 00:20:10,846
Perhaps, but I was onIy saying.

225
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:11,981
Yes.

226
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:15,256
Yes. Anyhow, why are you here?

227
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:18,296
Bernard, are you coming or not, damn it?

228
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:22,123
A ceIebration?

229
00:20:22,701 --> 00:20:24,032
A promotion.

230
00:20:25,304 --> 00:20:26,566
I'II be going.

231
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:28,038
No, stay!

232
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:30,506
What were you here for?

233
00:20:31,944 --> 00:20:34,003
Yes, I was here for...

234
00:20:35,114 --> 00:20:36,979
CouId you cIose the door?

235
00:20:38,951 --> 00:20:40,680
Just a minute!

236
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:42,380
So? You were here for?

237
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:53,194
What's going on?
Why did you Ieave Iike that?

238
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:56,229
You turn up, you Ieave... What's going on?

239
00:20:58,003 --> 00:20:59,436
Come on, now.

240
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,598
Come with me.

241
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:07,373
Look at me. You were here for a reason?

242
00:21:07,446 --> 00:21:08,572
Yes.

243
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:10,547
So teII me aII about it.

244
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:19,114
Something to drink?

245
00:21:19,425 --> 00:21:20,722
No, thank you.

246
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:24,595
AII right. I'm Iistening.

247
00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:29,192
WeII, I found a waIIet.

248
00:21:31,103 --> 00:21:32,434
You have it here?

249
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:36,770
Of course, but you know...

250
00:21:38,377 --> 00:21:39,401
What?

251
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,708
Nothing.

252
00:21:50,923 --> 00:21:52,151
Here it is.

253
00:21:55,294 --> 00:21:56,989
Where did you find it?

254
00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:00,523
Where? In the shopping center car park.

255
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:02,965
-Any money in it?
-No.

256
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:12,239
I know, that photo isn't...

257
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:13,778
But Iook at the other.

258
00:22:13,846 --> 00:22:15,575
There's that, too?

259
00:22:16,515 --> 00:22:17,948
Look.

260
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:20,442
I guess.

261
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:22,314
She Iooks Iike HeIene Boucher.

262
00:22:22,755 --> 00:22:24,245
Who?

263
00:22:24,323 --> 00:22:26,484
An aviatrix from the thirties...

264
00:22:27,292 --> 00:22:31,285
Paris-Saigon soIo, seven worId records,
an acrobatic ace,

265
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:34,523
fataIIy injured during a training fIight.

266
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,095
You know your stuff.

267
00:22:37,936 --> 00:22:39,927
I read about her as a boy.

268
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:43,174
Leave me your phone number and address.

269
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:46,276
Just in case. There may be a reward.

270
00:22:46,812 --> 00:22:48,302
A reward? What reward?

271
00:22:48,714 --> 00:22:50,238
For the...

272
00:22:51,116 --> 00:22:53,949
Are you going to Iet her know?

273
00:22:54,753 --> 00:22:56,721
This evening? Right away?

274
00:22:57,089 --> 00:22:59,080
It's a IittIe Iate now.

275
00:22:59,224 --> 00:23:00,885
What's your name?

276
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:06,593
PaIet, Georges PaIet. P-A-L-E-T.

277
00:23:06,665 --> 00:23:07,723
PaIet.

278
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:10,462
Georges.

279
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,435
Your address?

280
00:23:12,504 --> 00:23:16,497
He's recognized me, I can see he has.
It'll come back to him.

281
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,610
What do I do? Kill him?

282
00:23:19,678 --> 00:23:22,408
And what's your phone number?

283
00:24:13,198 --> 00:24:15,325
Thanks for doing the Iawn.

284
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:19,831
If that's aII it takes to make you happy.

285
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:24,303
Something wrong?

286
00:24:32,251 --> 00:24:34,913
That waIIet... Did you take it in?

287
00:24:34,987 --> 00:24:36,784
Yes, but I'm worried.

288
00:24:37,356 --> 00:24:39,790
I wanted to reassure her myseIf.

289
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,523
WouIdn't you worry
if you Iost aII your papers?

290
00:24:44,596 --> 00:24:45,756
You bet.

291
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:48,933
But what can you do?

292
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:51,733
You took it to the poIice.

293
00:24:52,004 --> 00:24:53,335
Did it go weII?

294
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:55,268
Why?

295
00:24:55,841 --> 00:24:57,138
No reason.

296
00:24:57,543 --> 00:25:00,103
They'II Iet her know. Don't worry.

297
00:25:01,446 --> 00:25:04,813
Yes, but after how Iong?

298
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:10,314
How Iong wiII it take?

299
00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:12,823
I'd have Iet her know right away, see?

300
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:14,017
Yes.

301
00:25:14,693 --> 00:25:16,183
One point in my favor.

302
00:25:23,602 --> 00:25:25,627
It's ridicuIous to wait.

303
00:25:25,704 --> 00:25:27,365
So try again.

304
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,340
CaIIing someone?

305
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,750
Yes, that woman.

306
00:26:16,555 --> 00:26:18,216
This Iate?

307
00:26:29,635 --> 00:26:30,897
How do I Iook?

308
00:26:30,969 --> 00:26:32,027
Very nice.

309
00:26:32,104 --> 00:26:34,072
Sure? Not too much makeup?

310
00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:35,629
No, you Iook IoveIy.

311
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:40,740
Put the meat on! They'II be here soon.

312
00:26:40,812 --> 00:26:42,177
It has to get going.

313
00:26:42,247 --> 00:26:43,680
Put it on anyway.

314
00:26:44,016 --> 00:26:46,280
Fine, but it won't cook.

315
00:26:48,086 --> 00:26:50,919
Seen the ash tree? It's started sprouting.

316
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:52,320
I've seen.

317
00:26:52,391 --> 00:26:54,882
-Pass me the meat.
-I'II see to it.

318
00:26:55,093 --> 00:26:56,219
You can set the tabIe.

319
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:08,597
Do you think EIodie is happy?

320
00:27:08,674 --> 00:27:10,369
Yes, she's happy.

321
00:27:10,442 --> 00:27:13,707
They have two chiIdren.
She isn't unhappy with him.

322
00:27:14,346 --> 00:27:17,281
Then again, with her, you never can teII.

323
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:20,946
I find EIodie's husband very kind.

324
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,578
A decent guy.

325
00:27:24,623 --> 00:27:26,750
Where are they?

326
00:27:27,926 --> 00:27:29,120
They're here!

327
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:30,422
I've seen.

328
00:27:38,537 --> 00:27:39,868
Sweetheart...

329
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:43,604
-Are you weII?
-Yes, and happy to see you.

330
00:27:43,675 --> 00:27:45,870
-You Iook beautifuI.
-Thank you.

331
00:27:48,447 --> 00:27:51,075
-How's my IittIe girI? Happy?
-Of course.

332
00:27:54,086 --> 00:27:55,246
Look.

333
00:27:57,055 --> 00:27:59,114
-He chose it.
-ReaIIy?

334
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:02,793
How's boxing?

335
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:04,522
Training for the championship.

336
00:28:04,596 --> 00:28:05,927
Something to drink?

337
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:21,406
We could use ''tu'' now.

338
00:28:22,047 --> 00:28:24,277
I'd rather not, if you don't mind.

339
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,176
Do you mind?

340
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:28,583
No, I was just asking.

341
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:33,255
Use ''tu'' to say what?
We're fine like this, aren't we?

342
00:28:34,793 --> 00:28:36,818
Come on, have a drink.

343
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:43,765
Ready for seconds?

344
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:49,633
Thank you.

345
00:28:52,444 --> 00:28:55,208
Wasn't MarceIin coming?

346
00:28:55,747 --> 00:28:57,044
We're expecting him.

347
00:28:57,115 --> 00:28:58,980
We won't wait.

348
00:29:00,085 --> 00:29:01,279
He'II be here soon.

349
00:29:01,353 --> 00:29:04,015
With him, you never know.

350
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:07,759
Come down to the cIub to see a fight.

351
00:29:07,826 --> 00:29:09,157
I don't know. Maybe.

352
00:29:09,728 --> 00:29:11,093
With MarceIin!

353
00:29:11,463 --> 00:29:13,522
You know me and boxing...

354
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:15,930
I'm training for the championship.

355
00:29:16,935 --> 00:29:18,766
What were you talking about?

356
00:29:19,004 --> 00:29:22,906
I'd like to use ''tu'' with your father.
But he doesn't want to.

357
00:29:22,974 --> 00:29:24,908
My father's like that.

358
00:29:24,976 --> 00:29:26,534
Right, Dad?

359
00:29:28,447 --> 00:29:30,210
Wasn't Marcelin coming?

360
00:29:30,282 --> 00:29:31,909
With him, you never know.

361
00:29:40,425 --> 00:29:40,459
A garden's great.

362
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:42,654
A garden's great.

363
00:29:45,197 --> 00:29:46,596
Hi, everybody.

364
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,397
I'II get it.

365
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,308
May I speak to Georges Palet?

366
00:30:30,475 --> 00:30:31,874
Dad, it's for you!

367
00:30:40,986 --> 00:30:43,011
-Who is it?
-Some Iady.

368
00:30:44,556 --> 00:30:45,784
-She didn't give her name?
-No.

369
00:30:45,857 --> 00:30:47,051
What did she say?

370
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:50,993
She asked for Mr. PaIet.
Georges PaIet. Is that you?

371
00:30:51,563 --> 00:30:55,590
Yes, you fooI. You're MarceIin PaIet
because I'm Georges PaIet!

372
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:57,328
Nothing to be proud of.

373
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,675
-HeIIo.
-Yes?

374
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:11,515
I'm Iistening.

375
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:12,845
Actually...

376
00:31:13,151 --> 00:31:15,312
I'm calling because...

377
00:31:15,387 --> 00:31:16,911
Because what?

378
00:31:16,988 --> 00:31:18,512
To thank you.

379
00:31:19,658 --> 00:31:20,784
What for?

380
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:24,795
Just a second. Didn't you find my wallet?

381
00:31:25,964 --> 00:31:27,829
-I did.
-All right.

382
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,493
Well, I wanted to thank you.

383
00:31:32,637 --> 00:31:34,571
-Is that aII?
-What else?

384
00:31:37,642 --> 00:31:40,008
-I don't know. You couId...
-What?

385
00:31:42,948 --> 00:31:44,813
I don't know...

386
00:31:45,183 --> 00:31:46,912
FeeI Iike meeting me.

387
00:31:46,985 --> 00:31:49,613
What for? I don't see any need to.

388
00:31:51,957 --> 00:31:53,652
-I'm not surprised.
-What?

389
00:31:53,725 --> 00:31:55,249
I'm not surprised!

390
00:31:55,327 --> 00:31:57,158
-Listen...
-No, I won't Iisten.

391
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,593
You disappoint me.

392
00:32:03,435 --> 00:32:05,335
What's wrong with Dad?

393
00:32:05,403 --> 00:32:07,428
He's...

394
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,431
I don't know.
What could be wrong with him?

395
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:13,067
He should take up a sport.

396
00:32:16,848 --> 00:32:18,110
Near the tennis courts,

397
00:32:18,183 --> 00:32:22,051
Georges realized he was perhaps
doing something stupid,

398
00:32:22,754 --> 00:32:24,745
something not quite right.

399
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:29,722
Come down to the cIub one day.

400
00:32:30,195 --> 00:32:31,662
To see a fight.

401
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:34,592
If you're interested.

402
00:32:36,501 --> 00:32:38,298
My father's Iike that.

403
00:32:39,904 --> 00:32:41,496
Right, Dad?

404
00:32:46,878 --> 00:32:49,938
I'm so ashamed of that phone call,

405
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:52,773
of the way I reacted.

406
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,247
Let's see where she lives.

407
00:34:24,642 --> 00:34:27,270
I'm so ashamed of that phone call,

408
00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:29,804
of the way I reacted.

409
00:34:30,348 --> 00:34:34,250
So ashamed I fell ill on a Sunday.

410
00:34:35,353 --> 00:34:38,288
Suzanne had to send for a Sunday doctor

411
00:34:38,356 --> 00:34:40,221
at the Sunday rate.

412
00:34:42,026 --> 00:34:44,859
I can't tell her that. It's not possible.

413
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,061
She mustn't read it!

414
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:58,773
I don't want her to read it!

415
00:35:01,413 --> 00:35:03,779
What on earth are you doing?

416
00:35:05,183 --> 00:35:07,515
You'II break it, my boy!

417
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:09,880
Who are you anyway?

418
00:35:10,155 --> 00:35:11,713
I don't know you.

419
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:14,190
I've never been here before and...

420
00:35:14,259 --> 00:35:15,556
And what?

421
00:35:15,994 --> 00:35:21,455
And I've never done this before,
but I have to get my Ietter back.

422
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,392
Can you heIp?

423
00:35:23,468 --> 00:35:26,767
My dear feIIow, even if I wanted to, I can't.

424
00:35:27,705 --> 00:35:29,263
Is it that serious?

425
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,106
Serious? No, what is serious?
No, it's not serious.

426
00:35:33,878 --> 00:35:36,176
But I'd prefer her not to read it.

427
00:35:36,414 --> 00:35:38,314
So it is serious.

428
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:42,243
Do you know her?

429
00:35:43,354 --> 00:35:44,412
By sight.

430
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:46,948
What's she Iike?

431
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,288
I mean... In reaI Iife?

432
00:35:53,598 --> 00:35:54,622
Don't you taIk?

433
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,666
HeIIo now and then.

434
00:35:59,237 --> 00:36:01,000
If you see her,

435
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,940
couId you teII her...

436
00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:24,286
You have a Ietter, from a gentIeman.

437
00:36:24,362 --> 00:36:26,626
-What gentIeman?
-He didn't say his name.

438
00:36:26,698 --> 00:36:27,824
ReaIIy?

439
00:36:27,899 --> 00:36:31,630
No, he just said
that he forbade you to read it.

440
00:36:31,703 --> 00:36:32,931
Fancy, and why?

441
00:36:33,004 --> 00:36:34,938
No idea. Give it to me.

442
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:36,371
Are you joking?

443
00:36:36,441 --> 00:36:38,432
I have to tear it up!

444
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,977
It's mine.

445
00:36:40,745 --> 00:36:44,449
She didn't add, ''Now. '' But she thought it.

446
00:37:03,902 --> 00:37:08,635
She read it. She didn't die of it.
One doesn't die of that.

447
00:37:08,706 --> 00:37:11,732
Reading never killed anyone.
It helps you live.

448
00:37:33,498 --> 00:37:35,022
She replied.

449
00:37:39,604 --> 00:37:43,005
She replied very kindly.
A couple of words, three lines,

450
00:37:43,308 --> 00:37:44,798
a quarter page...

451
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:49,044
I consider

452
00:37:50,048 --> 00:37:52,243
the matter closed.

453
00:37:54,118 --> 00:37:58,282
Everyone makes mistakes.

454
00:37:59,023 --> 00:38:00,820
It's part of our lot,

455
00:38:00,892 --> 00:38:04,885
to get ideas.

456
00:38:06,097 --> 00:38:09,555
It took more than that
to discourage old Georges.

457
00:38:10,802 --> 00:38:15,466
He kept writing
about what he believed his life to be.

458
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,201
He ended up believing it.

459
00:38:17,442 --> 00:38:21,776
No, he believed it.
He wrote it, so he believed it.

460
00:38:21,846 --> 00:38:23,746
One has to believe to write.

461
00:38:23,815 --> 00:38:28,445
And it's so real one ends up believing.

462
00:38:30,655 --> 00:38:33,783
I don't know if I've already told you...

463
00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:37,158
Yes, I have already told you.

464
00:38:37,729 --> 00:38:43,133
I've already spoken about my old passion

465
00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:44,998
for flying.

466
00:38:46,604 --> 00:38:49,801
I shared that with my father.

467
00:38:51,376 --> 00:38:54,345
He dreamt of being a pilot,

468
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,349
but ended up a motorcycle mechanic.

469
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:02,249
Motorcycles don't fly.

470
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:14,127
We buried my father a week ago.

471
00:39:15,433 --> 00:39:19,597
I wonder what I can talk about.

472
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:27,302
My mother is threatening suicide.

473
00:39:28,212 --> 00:39:30,544
I don't dare...

474
00:39:36,621 --> 00:39:38,054
She read his words

475
00:39:38,756 --> 00:39:40,621
but didn't reply.

476
00:40:24,669 --> 00:40:26,330
Two messages.

477
00:40:26,404 --> 00:40:28,099
First message.

478
00:40:28,172 --> 00:40:30,231
It's Josepha. The prosthodontist called.

479
00:40:30,308 --> 00:40:34,369
He won't be ready by tomorrow.
He's sorry. Take care.

480
00:40:34,512 --> 00:40:36,571
Second message.

481
00:40:36,647 --> 00:40:41,050
It's me again. You're never home.
I wanted to talk to you

482
00:40:41,953 --> 00:40:44,012
about everything and nothing.

483
00:40:44,322 --> 00:40:45,812
But not about nothing.

484
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,119
As if we were having a drink.

485
00:40:48,192 --> 00:40:53,789
Georges called every evening.
Her answering machine always answered.

486
00:40:53,865 --> 00:40:55,389
Answering machines do that.

487
00:40:55,466 --> 00:40:59,698
I heard my father saying,
''Your mother tried to commit suicide. ''

488
00:40:59,771 --> 00:41:02,706
I went to the hospital where I was born.

489
00:41:02,774 --> 00:41:04,537
When I came over, she said,

490
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:07,840
''Spare me that look.
You'd never have the guts. ''

491
00:41:07,912 --> 00:41:10,972
I call that a desire for murder. Don't you?

492
00:41:11,048 --> 00:41:13,243
Well, I must dash.

493
00:41:13,317 --> 00:41:15,251
I have to put the ravioli on.

494
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:17,082
No more messages.

495
00:41:30,034 --> 00:41:34,232
One evening, he caught her
without her machine on.

496
00:41:34,806 --> 00:41:38,537
She was there, in person, for once.

497
00:41:39,811 --> 00:41:41,472
It's you?

498
00:41:41,546 --> 00:41:44,208
I'm very gIad to speak to you.

499
00:41:44,282 --> 00:41:46,682
-Because...
-Because what?

500
00:41:49,554 --> 00:41:52,182
I'm asking you, begging you,

501
00:41:52,256 --> 00:41:54,520
not to write to me anymore, pIease.

502
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:56,185
Leave me in peace.

503
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:59,229
No, that's impossibIe. Am I at peace?

504
00:42:00,264 --> 00:42:02,858
Not since I got to know you!

505
00:42:04,268 --> 00:42:07,032
Why refuse to see me? I won't kiII...

506
00:42:07,772 --> 00:42:09,364
Eat you!

507
00:42:57,221 --> 00:42:58,950
I wanted to make you stay.

508
00:42:59,757 --> 00:43:03,818
To delay you, talk to you.
I couldn't find a better way.

509
00:43:04,128 --> 00:43:06,790
You know, I'm not an evil man.

510
00:43:07,465 --> 00:43:11,731
When I realized what I'd done,
I panicked. I'm running away.

511
00:43:13,037 --> 00:43:14,698
But first,

512
00:43:14,906 --> 00:43:19,206
I want you to know
that I'm the one who slashed you.

513
00:43:19,277 --> 00:43:22,075
No, who did this to you.

514
00:43:31,188 --> 00:43:34,316
That was it. She was going to the police.

515
00:43:38,462 --> 00:43:40,760
This is Marguerite Muir.

516
00:43:41,265 --> 00:43:42,755
Do you remember me?

517
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:44,460
I remember.

518
00:43:45,136 --> 00:43:46,660
I came about...

519
00:43:46,737 --> 00:43:48,637
I remember very weII.

520
00:43:48,706 --> 00:43:50,469
You have a good memory.

521
00:43:52,743 --> 00:43:55,644
We have it here for you,

522
00:43:56,047 --> 00:43:57,844
from 8.:00 to 12.:00 and from 2.:00 to 5.:00.

523
00:43:57,915 --> 00:44:00,383
I'm so pIeased. I'm on my way.

524
00:44:14,632 --> 00:44:16,259
I'm the person.

525
00:44:16,734 --> 00:44:19,601
You caIIed. I'm here for my waIIet.

526
00:44:20,404 --> 00:44:23,134
Perhaps it wasn't you I spoke to.

527
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:26,574
Yes, it was. It was me.

528
00:44:27,178 --> 00:44:28,645
This way.

529
00:44:32,783 --> 00:44:34,683
You have it, then?

530
00:44:40,992 --> 00:44:42,323
Where did you Iose it?

531
00:44:42,393 --> 00:44:45,021
I didn't Iose it, it was stoIen.

532
00:44:45,096 --> 00:44:47,030
My bag was snatched.

533
00:44:49,367 --> 00:44:50,994
Do you have my bag, too?

534
00:44:51,068 --> 00:44:52,535
I'm afraid not.

535
00:44:52,603 --> 00:44:54,537
Where did you find it?

536
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:58,805
The thief emptied out your bag.
He found nothing.

537
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:02,739
He got rid of the bag. He took the bus.

538
00:45:03,347 --> 00:45:04,814
Why the bus?

539
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:08,379
He emptied the waIIet. He found the money.

540
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:10,311
Was there money in it?

541
00:45:10,988 --> 00:45:12,717
Three fifty-euro notes.

542
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:15,615
He dumped the waIIet in the car park.

543
00:45:15,693 --> 00:45:16,990
Which car park?

544
00:45:17,061 --> 00:45:18,756
The shopping center one.

545
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:21,764
-Which shopping center?
-In L'Hay-Ies-Roses.

546
00:45:21,966 --> 00:45:24,662
Yes, I know where that is.

547
00:45:26,003 --> 00:45:28,369
That's so far from where I Iive!

548
00:45:28,439 --> 00:45:31,931
He probabIy spent it aII on CD's and tapes.

549
00:45:32,376 --> 00:45:34,139
Yes, that's possibIe.

550
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:36,544
WeII, anyway,

551
00:45:37,581 --> 00:45:39,014
sign here.

552
00:45:41,419 --> 00:45:44,445
And in the future...

553
00:45:49,527 --> 00:45:52,519
I'd Iike to know who found my waIIet.

554
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:55,362
I'd Iike to thank them.

555
00:45:56,434 --> 00:45:59,130
Mr. PaIet, Georges.

556
00:45:59,203 --> 00:46:02,764
What's he Iike? As a man?
Just being curious.

557
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,604
Is he young or oId? Just being curious.

558
00:46:05,709 --> 00:46:08,269
PIease, it's onIy naturaI.

559
00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:12,015
An individuaI aged around fifty,

560
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:16,315
average height, sIim, aImost white hair,

561
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:19,753
with eyes, Iet me see...

562
00:46:20,491 --> 00:46:24,689
Light-coIored, yes,
very Iight, kind eyes, but odd.

563
00:46:24,795 --> 00:46:28,322
A Iined face.
Something must have wasted him,

564
00:46:28,399 --> 00:46:32,665
perhaps an iIIness or a big probIem,
a very big probIem.

565
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:38,367
In short, an odd feIIow indeed.
I didn't understand aII he said.

566
00:46:39,009 --> 00:46:40,601
But, the main thing is...

567
00:46:40,678 --> 00:46:41,872
You said it.

568
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,713
You have a good memory.

569
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:52,353
What's the probIem?
Have you been attacked again?

570
00:46:52,623 --> 00:46:55,717
Not exactIy. WeII, yes.
That's why I wanted to see you.

571
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,687
What's wrong?

572
00:46:58,796 --> 00:47:02,288
Nothing too serious
but it's taking on such proportions...

573
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:06,358
I thought that maybe
I couId stop by to see you.

574
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:09,398
Of course, but teII me what's wrong.

575
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,435
WeII, this feIIow,

576
00:47:11,675 --> 00:47:13,336
this man, this gentIeman...

577
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:16,208
The gentIeman who found my waIIet...

578
00:47:16,547 --> 00:47:18,538
Yes, what about him?

579
00:47:19,283 --> 00:47:20,375
This is so awkward.

580
00:47:20,584 --> 00:47:22,211
Is he demanding a reward?

581
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,087
In a way, yes.

582
00:47:24,421 --> 00:47:26,480
How do you mean, in a way?

583
00:47:28,425 --> 00:47:31,189
Is he propositioning you?

584
00:47:32,263 --> 00:47:33,696
Threatening you?

585
00:47:33,764 --> 00:47:38,463
No, weII yes, weII no.
Oh, you're getting on my nerves.

586
00:47:39,436 --> 00:47:40,460
Pardon me?

587
00:47:40,538 --> 00:47:43,371
-He's demanding to see me.
-And?

588
00:47:43,841 --> 00:47:45,741
-He wants to know me.
-That's all?

589
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:47,242
He keeps writing to me.

590
00:47:47,311 --> 00:47:48,300
He'II caIm down.

591
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:50,438
He won't. Yesterday morning...

592
00:47:50,548 --> 00:47:51,606
What happened?

593
00:47:53,217 --> 00:47:54,582
He came to my street.

594
00:47:57,354 --> 00:47:59,345
He sIashed the tires on my car.

595
00:47:59,757 --> 00:48:02,021
Now that changes everything.

596
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,451
That's much more serious.

597
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:07,820
You must come in to see us.

598
00:48:08,566 --> 00:48:12,161
That's what I want to do,
but not to press charges.

599
00:48:12,236 --> 00:48:14,170
You have to make a statement.

600
00:48:14,238 --> 00:48:18,106
I don't want any troubIe.
He's probabIy a decent man.

601
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:20,837
I'd just Iike you to taIk to him.

602
00:48:22,046 --> 00:48:24,606
Is that possibIe? Can you do that?

603
00:48:30,387 --> 00:48:33,083
And repaint the attic door, too.

604
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:36,223
You know, the dormer window.
Understand?

605
00:48:37,328 --> 00:48:38,955
You see what I mean?

606
00:48:42,399 --> 00:48:45,232
Forgive me, that's not what I meant.

607
00:48:45,302 --> 00:48:47,736
I'm Iate, I had a bad night.

608
00:48:48,272 --> 00:48:50,900
You'II do it, then? I can count on you?

609
00:48:50,975 --> 00:48:52,033
Yes.

610
00:48:54,411 --> 00:48:55,708
See that pIane?

611
00:48:57,448 --> 00:48:59,678
That's a Cessna SkyIane.

612
00:49:00,584 --> 00:49:05,078
230 horsepower,
270 kiIometers per hour at top speed.

613
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:08,883
1,700 kiIometers on a fuII tank.

614
00:49:11,762 --> 00:49:15,493
And put some newspaper down.
For the drops of paint.

615
00:49:35,386 --> 00:49:37,320
Come in, it's not Iocked!

616
00:49:45,329 --> 00:49:47,024
Is it my wife?

617
00:49:47,097 --> 00:49:50,726
No, no, don't worry. We just want a word.

618
00:49:50,801 --> 00:49:52,234
I'II come down.

619
00:49:57,241 --> 00:49:58,902
-Do you recognize me?
-Of course.

620
00:49:59,076 --> 00:50:01,442
I didn't from above, with the cap.

621
00:50:01,512 --> 00:50:04,140
But now I do, seen face on.

622
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,780
Repainting the house?

623
00:50:06,116 --> 00:50:09,643
My wife wants to change
the gate and the door.

624
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,317
The rest has to match.

625
00:50:12,389 --> 00:50:15,187
Put something new in something oId...

626
00:50:15,392 --> 00:50:19,192
In an oId house, I mean,
and you have to repIace everything.

627
00:50:19,363 --> 00:50:21,593
It's true. You have no choice.

628
00:50:22,266 --> 00:50:27,397
The previous stuff, the oId stuff,
soon becomes unbearabIe.

629
00:50:27,705 --> 00:50:31,607
You shouId just grow oId
and Iet it grow oId with you.

630
00:50:31,775 --> 00:50:35,211
That's what I wouId have Iiked,
but my wife...

631
00:50:35,379 --> 00:50:37,506
-You're married?
-For 30 years now.

632
00:50:38,082 --> 00:50:40,243
I even have grandchiIdren.

633
00:50:41,218 --> 00:50:44,187
I see this is going to take a whiIe.

634
00:50:44,288 --> 00:50:45,880
We'd better sit down.

635
00:50:46,523 --> 00:50:47,581
Coming?

636
00:50:47,858 --> 00:50:48,916
Lead the way.

637
00:50:57,501 --> 00:50:58,627
Come in.

638
00:51:07,678 --> 00:51:09,077
Let me tidy up.

639
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,470
Something to drink?

640
00:51:11,548 --> 00:51:13,243
No, thank you. You neither?

641
00:51:13,617 --> 00:51:14,675
No.

642
00:51:15,285 --> 00:51:16,547
AII right.

643
00:51:16,987 --> 00:51:19,046
But, if you don't mind,

644
00:51:19,757 --> 00:51:21,554
I'II have a quick one.

645
00:51:22,593 --> 00:51:24,288
Have a seat.

646
00:51:29,266 --> 00:51:32,758
Living with a wife and kids
in an apartment...

647
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,432
A house is better, but the upkeep...

648
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:59,286
It's good to sit down.
Being up a Iadder wears your Iegs out,

649
00:51:59,997 --> 00:52:01,828
keeping yourseIf steady.

650
00:52:03,934 --> 00:52:06,835
I'm not afraid of dying, but of faIIing.

651
00:52:07,271 --> 00:52:09,068
Of surviving.

652
00:52:09,907 --> 00:52:13,775
My right foot reaIIy aches.
I must have hurt myseIf.

653
00:52:13,944 --> 00:52:16,037
I was steadying myseIf with it.

654
00:52:16,113 --> 00:52:17,580
Let me take a Iook.

655
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:21,015
See that?

656
00:52:26,356 --> 00:52:28,847
Do you remember the waIIet?

657
00:52:29,126 --> 00:52:31,253
You bet I remember it!

658
00:52:31,495 --> 00:52:34,293
And Miss Muir, you remember her?

659
00:52:35,566 --> 00:52:37,295
Yes, her, too.

660
00:52:37,434 --> 00:52:38,458
Have you met?

661
00:52:38,535 --> 00:52:42,266
No, she caIIed me one Sunday to thank me.

662
00:52:43,173 --> 00:52:45,073
For what, God knows.

663
00:52:45,509 --> 00:52:49,309
I couIdn't taIk. My daughter was here.
With her husband.

664
00:52:49,546 --> 00:52:52,413
My son, too. He doesn't have chiIdren.

665
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:55,819
He has decided not to. I understand that.

666
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,745
To reproduce what?

667
00:53:00,624 --> 00:53:02,285
We couIdn't taIk much.

668
00:53:03,093 --> 00:53:05,084
I mean, her and me.

669
00:53:06,263 --> 00:53:09,027
She thanked me, and that was that.

670
00:53:14,738 --> 00:53:16,035
I see.

671
00:53:17,608 --> 00:53:19,405
Have you heard from her since?

672
00:53:20,711 --> 00:53:21,735
Why wouId I?

673
00:53:21,812 --> 00:53:23,677
-You couId have.
-Yes, you couId have.

674
00:53:23,747 --> 00:53:25,339
-Yes, you couId have.
-It happens.

675
00:53:25,449 --> 00:53:28,247
-You get acquainted.
-You taIk, caII back.

676
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:29,512
-Or write.
-Yes, or write.

677
00:53:29,586 --> 00:53:30,678
Yes, or write.

678
00:53:30,754 --> 00:53:32,278
Did you write to her?

679
00:53:32,356 --> 00:53:34,017
You get acquainted.

680
00:53:34,391 --> 00:53:35,824
You taIk, caII back.

681
00:53:35,893 --> 00:53:37,292
-Or write.
-Yes...

682
00:53:37,361 --> 00:53:39,522
-Or write.
-Yes, or write.

683
00:53:39,596 --> 00:53:41,826
Did you write to her?

684
00:53:41,899 --> 00:53:43,730
You get acquainted.

685
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,824
TaIk, caII back.

686
00:53:44,902 --> 00:53:46,062
-Or write.
-Yes, or write.

687
00:53:46,136 --> 00:53:47,763
-Yes, or write.
-Did you write to her?

688
00:53:51,608 --> 00:53:55,066
Listen. We're here to heIp you.

689
00:53:55,145 --> 00:53:57,613
To stop you from doing anything stupid.

690
00:53:57,681 --> 00:53:59,205
Something stupid?

691
00:53:59,349 --> 00:54:01,442
Do I Iook as if I wouId?

692
00:54:02,553 --> 00:54:05,386
Look at me! Look at the state I'm in!

693
00:54:06,523 --> 00:54:09,321
If I couId, do you know what I'd do?

694
00:54:09,893 --> 00:54:13,192
The same thing my oId neighbor did!

695
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:17,967
On the doIe at 50. Married, two kids.
He bIew his brains out!

696
00:54:18,168 --> 00:54:19,396
Boom! Bang!

697
00:54:21,238 --> 00:54:24,730
His wife's remarried.
They're redoing the house!

698
00:54:24,808 --> 00:54:26,469
See what that means?

699
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:29,839
It means...

700
00:54:34,451 --> 00:54:35,884
Oh, damn it.

701
00:54:38,622 --> 00:54:40,817
Listen, aII that's very sad.

702
00:54:40,891 --> 00:54:44,657
But Miss Muir came to see us.
She toId us everything.

703
00:54:48,865 --> 00:54:50,628
That's not possibIe.

704
00:54:52,169 --> 00:54:53,864
She didn't do that. Not her.

705
00:54:53,937 --> 00:54:54,995
She did.

706
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,704
The bitch.

707
00:54:58,775 --> 00:55:00,868
I mean it, what a bitch!

708
00:55:08,752 --> 00:55:10,947
I didn't mean her any harm.

709
00:55:11,154 --> 00:55:14,817
Neither did she.
She didn't even fiIe a compIaint.

710
00:55:14,891 --> 00:55:18,349
She isn't even asking you
to refund her costs.

711
00:55:18,428 --> 00:55:20,794
She just wants to be Ieft aIone.

712
00:55:21,164 --> 00:55:24,133
She has requested us to ask you that.

713
00:55:24,201 --> 00:55:25,862
So I'm asking you.

714
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:28,060
WiII you?

715
00:55:30,073 --> 00:55:33,941
Shit, shit, I'm sick of this bIoody Iife.

716
00:55:34,444 --> 00:55:37,379
WeII, is the answer yes? WiII you?

717
00:55:37,614 --> 00:55:38,672
Yes.

718
00:55:38,749 --> 00:55:40,216
-You promise?
-Yes.

719
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,318
Can we count on you?

720
00:55:44,454 --> 00:55:46,251
No worries, then?

721
00:55:49,726 --> 00:55:51,353
I said yes.

722
00:56:01,772 --> 00:56:03,933
That's a fine paint job.

723
00:56:04,007 --> 00:56:06,237
A beautifuI coIor, isn't it, Bernard?

724
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:08,339
Don't you Iike it?

725
00:56:08,545 --> 00:56:10,410
Doing everything in bIue?

726
00:56:18,588 --> 00:56:20,579
It's nearIy over now.

727
00:56:20,657 --> 00:56:22,056
Go ahead.

728
00:56:25,796 --> 00:56:27,423
You're hurting me!

729
00:56:28,498 --> 00:56:29,931
It's over.

730
00:56:30,767 --> 00:56:32,132
You can rinse.

731
00:56:35,005 --> 00:56:38,338
I never promised
you'd get your miIk teeth back.

732
00:56:41,244 --> 00:56:42,973
Look how handsome you are.

733
00:56:43,046 --> 00:56:44,673
Like at the barber's.

734
00:56:45,248 --> 00:56:47,842
-I was going to say something siIIy.
-What?

735
00:56:47,918 --> 00:56:49,146
I was going to say...

736
00:56:49,286 --> 00:56:51,277
-No, it's too siIIy.
-Say it anyway.

737
00:56:51,354 --> 00:56:55,051
I was going to say I can smiIe at you now.

738
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:57,883
I was even going to say next time, too.

739
00:56:58,328 --> 00:57:00,853
But there won't be a next time.

740
00:57:01,565 --> 00:57:03,863
But you'II be back, won't you?

741
00:57:05,635 --> 00:57:09,196
No more visions
of you bending down over me

742
00:57:09,272 --> 00:57:10,739
to fiII my teeth...

743
00:57:10,807 --> 00:57:11,796
How sweet.

744
00:57:17,547 --> 00:57:20,107
Off you go now. It's Iate.

745
00:57:53,717 --> 00:57:57,175
Meet Josepha Belotch.

746
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,888
Doctors Muir and Belotch.

747
00:57:59,956 --> 00:58:02,857
Two old friends. Inseparable.

748
00:58:03,226 --> 00:58:06,889
Pastimes, Josepha, the theatre.
Marguerite, aviation.

749
00:58:07,097 --> 00:58:09,088
A world, a gaping chasm.

750
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,325
And their view of men.

751
00:58:12,702 --> 00:58:14,067
Why the smiIe?

752
00:58:14,271 --> 00:58:16,239
It's oId Schwer.

753
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:19,636
Another Iast-minute decider.

754
00:58:20,076 --> 00:58:23,011
It changes nothing, but it gets on my nerves.

755
00:58:24,281 --> 00:58:27,910
He made a very pretty decIaration
before he Ieft.

756
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,019
By the way,

757
00:58:32,355 --> 00:58:35,324
any news of your... Your brutish suitor?

758
00:58:37,894 --> 00:58:40,328
No. No more news.

759
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:41,724
You sound as if...

760
00:58:41,798 --> 00:58:43,595
Yes, that's how it is.

761
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:46,502
I'm sorry I acted the way I did.

762
00:58:48,038 --> 00:58:51,107
I'm worried he'II get into troubIe.

763
00:59:36,386 --> 00:59:38,183
AII right, I'm coming.

764
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:46,058
I'm disturbing you. It's very late.

765
00:59:47,497 --> 00:59:51,092
I hope I didn't wake you.

766
00:59:51,468 --> 00:59:53,197
Is this Miss Muir?

767
00:59:53,737 --> 00:59:54,795
Yes.

768
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:58,507
But how on earth did you know?

769
00:59:59,776 --> 01:00:01,004
The voice...

770
01:00:02,445 --> 01:00:03,673
The voice.

771
01:00:03,747 --> 01:00:05,647
I still don't understand.

772
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:12,119
Georges taIks to me a Iot about it.

773
01:00:12,555 --> 01:00:14,352
He describes it,

774
01:00:14,424 --> 01:00:17,723
and, beIieve me,
Georges can be very precise.

775
01:00:18,361 --> 01:00:19,350
And...

776
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:26,067
And I was reaIIy hoping...

777
01:00:28,939 --> 01:00:31,601
I can teII you, since you're there.

778
01:00:33,043 --> 01:00:35,876
It's just the two of us, two women.

779
01:00:37,881 --> 01:00:39,314
I was hoping you'd caII.

780
01:00:39,549 --> 01:00:40,811
Why?

781
01:00:41,584 --> 01:00:42,846
Why were you hoping that?

782
01:00:50,727 --> 01:00:51,921
May I taIk to him?

783
01:00:52,028 --> 01:00:54,292
ProbabIy, but not now. He isn't here.

784
01:00:55,332 --> 01:00:57,232
-Where is he?
-At the cinema.

785
01:00:59,169 --> 01:01:02,866
An oId war fiIm near the PIace d'ItaIie.

786
01:01:03,173 --> 01:01:06,836
About a US Navy piIot
during the Korean War.

787
01:01:08,712 --> 01:01:10,703
The Bridges at Toko-Ri.

788
01:01:11,081 --> 01:01:14,312
The pilot, shot down,
has to be brought back at any cost.

789
01:01:14,384 --> 01:01:17,182
His pal comes for him by helicopter.

790
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,185
The Koreans wait for it to land.

791
01:01:19,255 --> 01:01:21,553
The two men reunite. No shelter.

792
01:01:21,624 --> 01:01:24,616
Gunfire. The Koreans kill them both.

793
01:01:29,499 --> 01:01:31,399
I'II caII back.

794
01:01:45,749 --> 01:01:48,650
The fiIm ends in haIf an hour or so.

795
01:02:30,226 --> 01:02:34,560
''It's not far from here, '' thought Muir.
''What if I waited for him?''

796
01:02:34,631 --> 01:02:37,225
Marguerite had half an hour or so.

797
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:39,198
She didn't have any doubts.

798
01:02:39,302 --> 01:02:41,429
She knew she'd recognize Georges.

799
01:02:41,504 --> 01:02:44,234
Without ever having seen him? Yes.

800
01:04:02,952 --> 01:04:04,476
Your coffee.

801
01:04:14,197 --> 01:04:15,664
Thank you.

802
01:04:28,411 --> 01:04:30,879
A doubIe espresso this Iate...

803
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:00,766
After the cinema, nothing surprises you.

804
01:05:02,011 --> 01:05:05,674
Anything can happen.
It doesn't surprise you.

805
01:05:06,082 --> 01:05:09,882
Anything can happen
as naturally as possible.

806
01:06:02,572 --> 01:06:03,766
You Iove me, then?

807
01:06:09,312 --> 01:06:10,745
No, no.

808
01:06:13,149 --> 01:06:14,173
It's just...

809
01:06:14,751 --> 01:06:15,775
What?

810
01:06:17,987 --> 01:06:19,511
Don't Iook Iike that...

811
01:06:20,123 --> 01:06:21,147
What?

812
01:06:21,224 --> 01:06:22,213
Nothing.

813
01:06:26,829 --> 01:06:30,094
I was saying, it's just...

814
01:06:32,802 --> 01:06:34,736
I was worried about you.

815
01:06:36,172 --> 01:06:40,108
That's right.
Deep down, you can worry without Ioving.

816
01:06:41,177 --> 01:06:42,508
Can't you?

817
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:48,677
Yes, why not?

818
01:06:51,354 --> 01:06:53,185
But can one Iove without worrying?

819
01:06:58,428 --> 01:06:59,588
Yes, that, too.

820
01:06:59,962 --> 01:07:01,862
How did you know I was here?

821
01:07:02,165 --> 01:07:03,291
Your wife.

822
01:07:03,366 --> 01:07:04,424
Ah, yes, my wife.

823
01:07:04,534 --> 01:07:06,024
A kind woman, isn't she?

824
01:07:06,102 --> 01:07:07,626
She's more than that.

825
01:07:09,939 --> 01:07:11,270
Yes, weII.

826
01:07:12,542 --> 01:07:14,032
What do you want exactIy?

827
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:15,907
To have coffee with you.

828
01:07:30,426 --> 01:07:33,259
It feels odd to be walking together.

829
01:07:33,396 --> 01:07:35,887
You've barely met.
You've spoken on the phone.

830
01:07:36,132 --> 01:07:38,123
Let's call it speaking.

831
01:07:38,601 --> 01:07:40,398
You'd given up hope of meeting.

832
01:07:41,304 --> 01:07:43,932
Now you're walking together,

833
01:07:44,374 --> 01:07:46,137
not very straight.

834
01:07:47,009 --> 01:07:50,172
You could almost take each other's arm.

835
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:18,932
How was the fiIm?

836
01:08:20,743 --> 01:08:22,074
Is that aII?

837
01:08:23,513 --> 01:08:26,573
I was a boy when I first saw it.

838
01:08:26,649 --> 01:08:27,707
ReaIIy?

839
01:08:29,118 --> 01:08:30,278
And?

840
01:08:30,887 --> 01:08:33,287
Nothing, it did nothing for me.

841
01:08:33,923 --> 01:08:36,153
Not even the two friends' death.

842
01:08:36,225 --> 01:08:37,783
War is Iike that...

843
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:39,293
Don't you think?

844
01:08:39,862 --> 01:08:41,591
How about you?

845
01:08:44,367 --> 01:08:45,629
The pIanes?

846
01:08:49,639 --> 01:08:52,631
I don't have much time at the moment,

847
01:08:52,909 --> 01:08:54,900
but I hope to fIy again soon.

848
01:08:56,712 --> 01:08:59,306
Perhaps not next Sunday, but soon.

849
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:04,609
You shouId come.

850
01:09:04,787 --> 01:09:06,379
With your wife.

851
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:09,457
-With my wife?
-Yes.

852
01:09:09,725 --> 01:09:12,421
I'm sure she'd Iike that.

853
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:15,195
With my wife.

854
01:09:17,066 --> 01:09:19,557
-I see.
-You see what?

855
01:10:33,075 --> 01:10:34,975
Isn't Doctor Muir here?

856
01:10:35,244 --> 01:10:38,338
No, she's been heId up. PIease come in.

857
01:11:00,436 --> 01:11:02,267
-Thank you.
-You're weIcome.

858
01:11:11,914 --> 01:11:14,883
Because of Georges, that conversation...

859
01:11:14,951 --> 01:11:17,977
You sweep aside the important reasons.

860
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:19,585
You focus on details.

861
01:11:20,389 --> 01:11:23,881
For instance, instead of thinking,

862
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:27,088
''What on earth did I go there for?''

863
01:11:27,196 --> 01:11:29,756
You think, ''My hair didn't look good. ''

864
01:11:30,666 --> 01:11:32,361
''Maybe he didn't like my nose. ''

865
01:11:32,735 --> 01:11:37,069
He had looked at it
as if he'd never see it again.

866
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,369
''I hope he didn't see my teeth. ''

867
01:11:39,442 --> 01:11:40,670
Things like that.

868
01:11:40,876 --> 01:11:42,867
''Did he notice my feet?''

869
01:11:43,279 --> 01:11:44,871
What's going on?

870
01:11:45,481 --> 01:11:47,711
-Nothing.
-Are you iII?

871
01:11:47,917 --> 01:11:48,941
No.

872
01:11:49,685 --> 01:11:51,175
WeII, I don't think so.

873
01:11:51,253 --> 01:11:53,721
A patient asked if you were iII.
It surprised me.

874
01:11:54,056 --> 01:11:55,956
It's astounding.

875
01:11:56,425 --> 01:11:58,393
SeriousIy. What's going on?

876
01:11:58,561 --> 01:12:00,495
-Nothing.
-How do you mean?

877
01:12:00,997 --> 01:12:02,430
Nothing, okay?

878
01:12:02,498 --> 01:12:04,557
What about your patients?

879
01:12:04,767 --> 01:12:07,998
-I couIdn't care Iess.
-Really?

880
01:12:08,237 --> 01:12:09,465
You couIdn't care Iess?

881
01:12:09,538 --> 01:12:12,439
Honey, without patients, no money.

882
01:12:12,508 --> 01:12:15,272
Without money, no pIane. Thought of that?

883
01:12:16,946 --> 01:12:18,277
Let's think about it.

884
01:12:18,581 --> 01:12:21,607
She had bought an old Spit. A Spitfire.

885
01:12:21,684 --> 01:12:23,652
Dating from the war. A beauty.

886
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:26,381
In need of renovation but magnificent.

887
01:12:26,455 --> 01:12:27,945
With Mickey and a few others.

888
01:12:28,024 --> 01:12:30,925
Five, with Mickey. All crazy about engines.

889
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:35,028
They needed 60,000 euros,
peanuts, and a pilot.

890
01:12:35,297 --> 01:12:38,027
Muir volunteered. The boys applauded.

891
01:12:38,601 --> 01:12:41,729
Not only for the money.
They knew how Marguerite flew.

892
01:12:41,804 --> 01:12:43,567
They had seen her at work.

893
01:12:44,473 --> 01:12:45,770
Me, too.

894
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:06,890
I'II pick you up at 1 :00.

895
01:13:31,721 --> 01:13:33,848
Why don't you use your knife?

896
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:36,290
What's wrong?

897
01:13:48,137 --> 01:13:49,536
Is that him?

898
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:52,564
Is that him?

899
01:13:53,409 --> 01:13:54,535
Yes.

900
01:13:55,778 --> 01:13:57,211
I see.

901
01:13:58,114 --> 01:14:00,344
I'II taIk to him, you'II see.

902
01:14:00,583 --> 01:14:01,607
No, no, don't.

903
01:14:01,984 --> 01:14:03,076
Stay right here.

904
01:14:03,285 --> 01:14:05,082
Oh, Lord, I'm tipsy.

905
01:14:08,257 --> 01:14:09,952
Leave her aIone.

906
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:12,420
Who?

907
01:14:27,977 --> 01:14:30,241
Come on, we're Ieaving.

908
01:15:33,342 --> 01:15:35,037
So seductive.

909
01:15:35,411 --> 01:15:36,469
He has so much taIent.

910
01:15:36,579 --> 01:15:37,978
And genius?

911
01:15:38,047 --> 01:15:41,039
Please return to your seats.

912
01:15:41,383 --> 01:15:43,476
What? Were you taIking to me?

913
01:15:43,652 --> 01:15:44,812
If Georges had been here...

914
01:15:44,887 --> 01:15:46,912
Don't start that again!

915
01:15:47,256 --> 01:15:50,020
I want to see him, you hear? I have to.

916
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:53,185
-What do you mean, ''have to''?
-Don't worry about it.

917
01:15:53,696 --> 01:15:56,096
-I'II caII him.
-CaII him tomorrow.

918
01:15:56,165 --> 01:15:57,689
No, not tomorrow!

919
01:15:58,167 --> 01:16:00,431
I want to see him now.

920
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:04,306
At this time of night?
Are you out of your mind?

921
01:16:33,836 --> 01:16:35,701
CouId I speak to Georges?

922
01:16:36,438 --> 01:16:38,872
-Is that Miss Muir?
-Yes.

923
01:16:42,044 --> 01:16:44,945
It's very Iate, but couId I taIk to him?

924
01:16:45,014 --> 01:16:46,208
He's out.

925
01:16:46,649 --> 01:16:48,810
-At the cinema again?
-No.

926
01:16:49,652 --> 01:16:51,984
-I have to talk to you.
-To me?

927
01:16:53,188 --> 01:16:54,246
Now?

928
01:16:54,356 --> 01:16:55,414
But...

929
01:16:55,491 --> 01:16:57,550
PIease. It won't take Iong.

930
01:16:57,993 --> 01:17:00,018
WeII, if you reaIIy think so.

931
01:17:00,129 --> 01:17:01,221
Why not?

932
01:17:30,759 --> 01:17:33,990
This is absurd. What'II you say to her?

933
01:17:34,063 --> 01:17:35,963
Don't worry. Wait here.

934
01:17:54,616 --> 01:17:57,244
You're exactIy the way I imagined you.

935
01:17:58,253 --> 01:18:00,881
Let's have a cup of tea, shaII we?

936
01:18:33,655 --> 01:18:35,919
CouIdn't you park better than that?

937
01:18:37,426 --> 01:18:39,519
I'd Iike to get through to my house.

938
01:18:43,232 --> 01:18:44,995
So it's you?

939
01:18:46,702 --> 01:18:49,136
What are you doing? Waiting for me?

940
01:18:49,204 --> 01:18:51,764
-No, for Marguerite.
-ReaIIy?

941
01:18:53,509 --> 01:18:55,636
Your car, honestIy...

942
01:18:59,214 --> 01:19:01,045
You, on the other hand...

943
01:19:03,485 --> 01:19:05,476
Let me reIease you.

944
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:52,531
Bringing them home now?

945
01:19:52,601 --> 01:19:53,829
Of course not.

946
01:19:54,903 --> 01:19:56,461
She's Marguerite's friend.

947
01:19:58,841 --> 01:20:00,741
What's your name again?

948
01:20:00,876 --> 01:20:02,309
Josepha.

949
01:20:03,212 --> 01:20:05,510
Forgive me, but I'm parched.

950
01:20:05,781 --> 01:20:07,612
CouId I have a gIass of water?

951
01:20:07,683 --> 01:20:09,207
Of course.

952
01:20:12,154 --> 01:20:14,213
Come with me to the kitchen.

953
01:20:30,005 --> 01:20:31,131
Thank you.

954
01:20:38,547 --> 01:20:40,412
What are you doing in my home?

955
01:20:40,482 --> 01:20:41,949
Oh, no.

956
01:20:42,384 --> 01:20:46,115
Don't shout, because if you do,
I'II start shouting, too.

957
01:20:46,188 --> 01:20:48,349
And we can't start shouting.

958
01:20:53,829 --> 01:20:55,353
By the way, how was it?

959
01:20:57,366 --> 01:20:58,663
Not bad.

960
01:20:59,067 --> 01:21:01,194
FutiIe but not bad.

961
01:21:03,539 --> 01:21:05,268
I couId see her coming.

962
01:21:06,475 --> 01:21:08,943
I knew she'd try to have me
one of these days.

963
01:21:09,011 --> 01:21:11,844
I made the first move. That way it's settIed.

964
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:17,442
Go now. I never want to see you again.

965
01:21:29,498 --> 01:21:30,897
You understand?

966
01:21:32,768 --> 01:21:34,360
Never mind,

967
01:21:34,536 --> 01:21:37,027
we'II have Ioved each other weII.

968
01:21:43,879 --> 01:21:45,312
You're hurting me.

969
01:21:49,284 --> 01:21:51,081
You're hurting me.

970
01:21:58,093 --> 01:21:59,720
Same time Thursday.

971
01:22:00,395 --> 01:22:02,454
You hurt me aII the same.

972
01:22:02,731 --> 01:22:04,255
See you Thursday.

973
01:22:15,877 --> 01:22:17,037
You're hurting me.

974
01:22:19,615 --> 01:22:21,173
You're hurting me.

975
01:22:22,985 --> 01:22:24,111
You're hurting me.

976
01:22:27,789 --> 01:22:28,915
You're hurting me.

977
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:33,059
You're hurting me.

978
01:22:33,996 --> 01:22:36,260
Stop! You're hurting me!

979
01:22:39,101 --> 01:22:40,500
CIose your mouth now.

980
01:22:57,319 --> 01:22:59,412
Someone wiII take care of you.

981
01:23:01,156 --> 01:23:03,021
There's a patient in my office.

982
01:23:03,091 --> 01:23:05,457
CouId you finish up? I'm Ieaving.

983
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:09,554
I'II be in touch.

984
01:23:10,465 --> 01:23:11,864
Where are you going?

985
01:23:12,868 --> 01:23:15,496
Where are you going?
For God's sake, teII me!

986
01:23:51,306 --> 01:23:53,035
Miss Muir.

987
01:23:53,642 --> 01:23:55,075
Is that you?

988
01:23:55,243 --> 01:23:57,211
Is it reaIIy you? Just fancy...

989
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:59,246
How Iong has it been?

990
01:23:59,314 --> 01:24:01,612
I've come to see it. Can you Iet me in?

991
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:29,922
Three, four...

992
01:26:29,998 --> 01:26:32,933
Margot, greet the moon

993
01:26:33,235 --> 01:26:36,762
Greet the sun and the stars for me

994
01:26:37,138 --> 01:26:40,699
Take off, the aircraft flies away

995
01:26:40,775 --> 01:26:44,302
Above the hangars and the rooftops

996
01:26:44,713 --> 01:26:47,773
Margot, greet the moon

997
01:26:47,849 --> 01:26:51,979
Greet the sun and the stars for me

998
01:26:53,822 --> 01:26:55,255
It's us!

999
01:26:58,827 --> 01:27:03,059
Oh, Lord, they're so siIIy...
You can be so siIIy.

1000
01:27:03,131 --> 01:27:05,497
Oh, you're top-notch mechanics,

1001
01:27:06,201 --> 01:27:08,931
but you're four fooIs. Four idiots.

1002
01:27:09,971 --> 01:27:13,338
But I'm fond of you, reaIIy very fond.

1003
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,773
Give me a kiss.

1004
01:27:16,044 --> 01:27:17,671
What about me?

1005
01:27:21,850 --> 01:27:23,147
No way.

1006
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:27,950
What do you say, boys?

1007
01:27:28,023 --> 01:27:30,514
ShaII we Iet her drink her coffee?

1008
01:27:42,370 --> 01:27:43,997
HeIIo, Josepha?

1009
01:27:52,647 --> 01:27:55,207
No need to ring Iike that, I'm right here.

1010
01:27:56,718 --> 01:27:58,879
-Hadn't you seen me?
-I had.

1011
01:27:58,954 --> 01:28:01,115
WeII no. I shouIdn't have?

1012
01:28:01,189 --> 01:28:03,282
WiII it wear the beII out?

1013
01:28:03,358 --> 01:28:06,657
You're thinking of the biII?
Do you want me to chip in?

1014
01:28:06,995 --> 01:28:08,929
SeriousIy, do you want me to?

1015
01:28:08,997 --> 01:28:12,728
-Carry on, you interest me.
-There's a start to everything.

1016
01:28:12,801 --> 01:28:14,359
Are you gardening?

1017
01:28:15,370 --> 01:28:17,133
What do you want?

1018
01:28:17,439 --> 01:28:19,270
I've come to fetch you.

1019
01:28:19,608 --> 01:28:22,372
Me? What for? To go where?

1020
01:28:23,411 --> 01:28:26,574
Not just you,
I wouIdn't have come otherwise.

1021
01:28:27,716 --> 01:28:30,844
I'II ask again. What for? To go where?

1022
01:28:32,153 --> 01:28:33,415
There.

1023
01:28:34,289 --> 01:28:35,381
Where?

1024
01:28:36,057 --> 01:28:39,857
Where? You're making me
repeat aII my questions?

1025
01:28:40,662 --> 01:28:42,926
I'II ask again. Where?

1026
01:28:43,064 --> 01:28:45,123
Where Marguerite is.

1027
01:28:45,934 --> 01:28:46,923
Who?

1028
01:28:47,002 --> 01:28:50,165
Cut the crap, she sent me here.

1029
01:28:50,238 --> 01:28:51,705
To do what?

1030
01:28:51,773 --> 01:28:53,070
To drive you there.

1031
01:28:53,174 --> 01:28:54,402
Where?

1032
01:28:54,643 --> 01:28:56,042
To the fieId.

1033
01:28:57,212 --> 01:28:58,201
What for?

1034
01:28:58,279 --> 01:29:01,908
She's fIying and wants you...
WeII, Suzanne and you...

1035
01:29:05,687 --> 01:29:07,211
Ah, it's you.

1036
01:29:07,956 --> 01:29:10,322
I wondered who you were taIking to.

1037
01:29:10,392 --> 01:29:11,757
To her.

1038
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:15,893
Miss Muir wouId Iike to take us fIying.

1039
01:29:15,964 --> 01:29:17,397
What do you think?

1040
01:29:19,434 --> 01:29:21,664
That's an exceIIent idea.

1041
01:29:23,505 --> 01:29:25,564
No sooner said than done.

1042
01:29:26,441 --> 01:29:29,740
Sit in the sun
and we'II be aII yours in five minutes.

1043
01:29:38,253 --> 01:29:40,187
Miss Muir is fIying.

1044
01:29:40,255 --> 01:29:43,349
She's taken someone up for a first fIight.

1045
01:29:43,625 --> 01:29:46,093
No, a discovery fIight.

1046
01:29:46,161 --> 01:29:48,095
We don't say first fIight.

1047
01:29:48,163 --> 01:29:51,564
It's a discovery fIight these days.

1048
01:29:51,633 --> 01:29:55,069
We'II wait for her on the fieId.
We'II see you Iater.

1049
01:29:55,904 --> 01:29:59,305
Don't forget,
I'm expecting you aII for Iunch.

1050
01:29:59,541 --> 01:30:02,738
No Iater than 1 :00. My veaI stew won't wait.

1051
01:30:03,111 --> 01:30:05,079
You too, of course.

1052
01:30:09,684 --> 01:30:11,652
Don't be too Iong.

1053
01:30:32,407 --> 01:30:33,874
Have you seen? A Spitfire.

1054
01:30:34,576 --> 01:30:36,305
Just think! It's a Spit.

1055
01:30:36,411 --> 01:30:37,935
-If you say so.
-I'II take a Iook.

1056
01:30:38,012 --> 01:30:41,607
Stay here or I'm going,
I'm coId enough as it is!

1057
01:30:41,783 --> 01:30:43,683
AIright, caIm down.

1058
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,478
There she is.

1059
01:30:49,791 --> 01:30:52,589
She's beginning her turn. You see her?

1060
01:31:01,136 --> 01:31:03,229
I need to take a Ieak. Where do I go?

1061
01:31:03,304 --> 01:31:04,862
Over there, in the offices.

1062
01:31:07,242 --> 01:31:08,937
I'm going for a Ieak.

1063
01:31:09,077 --> 01:31:10,977
DeIighted to hear it!

1064
01:32:42,737 --> 01:32:45,604
-WeII? Was that fun?
-Yeah, it was.

1065
01:32:50,979 --> 01:32:52,241
Thank you.

1066
01:32:55,283 --> 01:32:57,478
Did you Iike it, Zambo dear?

1067
01:33:16,771 --> 01:33:18,329
Isn't Georges here?

1068
01:33:19,941 --> 01:33:21,033
HeIIo.

1069
01:33:21,242 --> 01:33:23,039
I'II give you a kiss.

1070
01:33:23,912 --> 01:33:27,370
-Your husband hasn't come?
-He's in the IittIe boy's room.

1071
01:33:27,482 --> 01:33:28,506
I see.

1072
01:33:28,583 --> 01:33:31,074
I have to caII in at the office.

1073
01:33:31,152 --> 01:33:32,619
I'II be right back.

1074
01:34:15,029 --> 01:34:19,432
With the demonstration,
I was scared you wouIdn't come.

1075
01:34:33,681 --> 01:34:36,149
We have to go, don't we? Don't you agree?

1076
01:34:36,217 --> 01:34:37,275
Yes.

1077
01:34:53,735 --> 01:34:57,102
-Want to sit in the front?
-No, you.

1078
01:34:57,472 --> 01:34:59,531
-Sit in the front.
-No, I said.

1079
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:07,714
-You're not coming?
-CertainIy not!

1080
01:35:07,882 --> 01:35:09,782
Go without me.

1081
01:35:37,245 --> 01:35:38,974
Line up on runway.

1082
01:35:39,047 --> 01:35:41,811
Takeoff, 90 kiIometers per hour.

1083
01:35:42,083 --> 01:35:45,541
Ascent, 130 kiIometers per hour to 300 feet.

1084
01:35:45,820 --> 01:35:48,152
Enter fIaps. Cut pump.

1085
01:35:48,656 --> 01:35:51,682
Engine speed, 2,600 rpm max.

1086
01:35:51,826 --> 01:35:54,590
Ascent, 1 40 kiIometers per hour
without fIaps.

1087
01:35:54,829 --> 01:35:55,887
Speed,

1088
01:35:56,197 --> 01:35:58,688
2,450 rpm.

1089
01:36:42,176 --> 01:36:43,837
Do you want to take over?

1090
01:36:43,911 --> 01:36:44,969
Oh, no, pIease.

1091
01:36:45,079 --> 01:36:48,480
I'm here, there's no danger.
I'II be watching him.

1092
01:36:49,016 --> 01:36:50,984
WeII, do you fancy trying?

1093
01:38:08,095 --> 01:38:12,657
Acrobatics, you don't do them here.
They're not allowed.

1094
01:38:14,068 --> 01:38:16,798
There are special places for that.

1095
01:38:17,004 --> 01:38:18,062
And this plane,

1096
01:38:18,539 --> 01:38:21,770
a Gardan, registration F-BN YJ,

1097
01:38:21,976 --> 01:38:23,409
wasn't designed for it.

1098
01:38:24,111 --> 01:38:27,137
For acrobatics, you're wiser using

1099
01:38:27,215 --> 01:38:29,183
a CAP 231 Mudry, for example.

1100
01:39:29,577 --> 01:39:31,067
Mummy?

1101
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:34,142
Yes?

1102
01:39:34,515 --> 01:39:38,110
When I'm a cat,
wiII I be abIe to eat cat munchies?
