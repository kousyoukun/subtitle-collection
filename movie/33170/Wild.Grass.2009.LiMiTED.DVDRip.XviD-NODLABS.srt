1
00:02:28,488 --> 00:02:31,026
She didn't have ordinary feet

2
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:34,409
So she went places she wouldn't go.

3
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,614
if she had ordinary feet.

4
00:02:36,997 --> 00:02:39,369
Unable to buy shoes just anywhere
from just anyone,

5
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:44,751
she went to a shoemaker in Paris,
located at...

6
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:48,546
I forget the name now.

7
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,675
It was on a street
near some pillars.

8
00:02:52,097 --> 00:02:52,963
It's still there.

9
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:58,302
The incident occurred
as she left the shop.

10
00:02:59,314 --> 00:03:04,439
What incident?
nothing significant or really important.

11
00:03:04,903 --> 00:03:08,772
A perfectly ordinary incident,
something commonplace.

12
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:11,649
But sometimes the commonplace,
the ordinary...

13
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,530
can lead to...

14
00:03:14,247 --> 00:03:15,326
to what?

15
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:16,703
That's what we'll see.

16
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:21,204
It was a beautiful day.

17
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,707
The sky was blue.
A winter sun.

18
00:03:24,092 --> 00:03:27,176
And she was in Paris to buy shoes.

19
00:03:27,595 --> 00:03:30,003
She hoped to see the
shop attendant she liked

20
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:33,557
whose touch gave her
a vague feeling of pleasure.

21
00:03:41,736 --> 00:03:45,319
Choosing, trying...
That took time.

22
00:03:45,907 --> 00:03:47,615
A matter of colour, model,

23
00:03:47,993 --> 00:03:50,069
sizes that never match.

24
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:54,452
It's always like this,
if you want things to match up

25
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,915
you have to accept,
however reluctantly

26
00:03:57,336 --> 00:04:01,121
to renounce, yield

27
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,422
and compromise

28
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:19,400
in the end, she picked a pair

29
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:23,818
very close to what she wanted,
of similar colour

30
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,275
and which above all,

31
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,452
fitted like a glove.

32
00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:29,869
Goodby

33
00:04:58,613 --> 00:04:59,692
She nearly cried out.

34
00:05:00,073 --> 00:05:00,855
How about that?

35
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,783
What did she nearly cry?

36
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:05,235
"Stop thief! Stop him?"

37
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:09,321
She thought of it, you know.
Everyone does in such cases.

38
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:14,041
if you drown, you cry out,
"Help! I'm drowning! Save me!"

39
00:05:14,422 --> 00:05:16,747
It's ridiculous,
but do we have much choice?

40
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:17,832
No!

41
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,840
We don't even have time
to find words of love ridiculous.

42
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:24,222
We cry out "Help! Murder!"

43
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:28,016
In fact, the words get stuck.
We don't dare to.

44
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:32,310
We die to scared to call out.
The true terror is silent.

45
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:34,150
Mouth agape.

46
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:37,906
In short, she didn't dare.

47
00:05:45,414 --> 00:05:48,913
She needed money,
but she had none left.

48
00:05:49,628 --> 00:05:51,086
She had her shoes.

49
00:05:51,463 --> 00:05:54,380
She decided to return them.

50
00:05:55,342 --> 00:05:58,094
She went back in the shop.

51
00:05:58,471 --> 00:06:01,222
She explained what had happened,

52
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:03,556
they understood: it happens.

53
00:06:03,935 --> 00:06:06,557
She asked for a refund.

54
00:06:07,856 --> 00:06:11,023
She also said
she'd come back for the shoes.

55
00:06:11,402 --> 00:06:13,026
Then she thanked them

56
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:14,566
said goodbye and left

57
00:06:15,781 --> 00:06:17,275
returned home

58
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,658
and ran herself an ice-cold bath.

59
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:24,029
It was too cold.
she added hot water

60
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:27,038
thinking, telling herself...

61
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,791
The police station can wait.

62
00:06:30,172 --> 00:06:32,878
There are hundreds of thefts
every day.

63
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,299
Besides, did I really need shoes?

64
00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:37,172
No, not really.

65
00:06:37,555 --> 00:06:39,382
Well, yes, I did.

66
00:06:40,058 --> 00:06:40,805
No.

67
00:06:41,185 --> 00:06:43,676
No I didn't need shoes.

68
00:06:44,062 --> 00:06:45,260
It's my fault.

69
00:06:45,647 --> 00:06:47,522
It was a whim, like that.

70
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:50,736
A treat, the way people buy records,
just to...

71
00:06:51,112 --> 00:06:53,069
Come on, calm down.

72
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:57,280
You must declare the theft of...

73
00:06:57,953 --> 00:07:01,701
your papers, your checkbook,
your credit cards...

74
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,122
I have to call the bank.

75
00:07:05,044 --> 00:07:07,202
I'll do all that tomorrow.

76
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:20,218
It's bound to stop in the end,
it's exhausted.

77
00:07:21,812 --> 00:07:23,604
Just like me.

78
00:07:25,192 --> 00:07:27,979
Why don't we stop?

79
00:07:30,864 --> 00:07:32,324
I need a new battery.

80
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,278
Certainly.

81
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,370
I'm used to it. Let me do it.

82
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,039
Thank you.

83
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,568
She'll mess up the date indicator.

84
00:08:15,581 --> 00:08:17,040
- What do I owe you?
- 15 Euros

85
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:32,331
That's how it began.

86
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,417
It might not have begun.

87
00:09:35,795 --> 00:09:38,036
He first picked up the wallet.

88
00:09:58,111 --> 00:09:59,605
Name: Muir

89
00:09:59,988 --> 00:10:03,487
First name: Marguerite.
Distinguishing features: None

90
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,242
Address: 8, rue des Ecoles,
Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine

91
00:10:09,123 --> 00:10:10,451
A serious looking face...

92
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:12,616
a little despondent...

93
00:10:13,002 --> 00:10:13,951
sad even...

94
00:10:15,338 --> 00:10:18,125
you could say sad,
a hint of sadness.

95
00:10:18,508 --> 00:10:20,632
But it was only a photo,

96
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:22,838
so, sad at that moment.

97
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,190
her Pilot's License photo
was so different!

98
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:35,648
it can't be the same woman.

99
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:38,353
It is though. It's the same name,

100
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:40,573
the same address.

101
00:10:42,327 --> 00:10:44,533
In this photo she's smiling.

102
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,204
A headband,

103
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,951
glasses on her forehead,
as a joke no doubt.

104
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:54,377
So she likes to joke.

105
00:10:54,923 --> 00:10:56,964
All right. She's a woman,

106
00:10:57,343 --> 00:11:00,344
sad more often than not,
with an odd name,

107
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:02,845
who flies a plane for fun.

108
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,013
What can I do with this?

109
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:22,075
What terrible taste!
Everything is excusable.

110
00:11:22,954 --> 00:11:25,956
Not, everything, not bad taste.

111
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:29,123
Suddenly, he wanted to touch her.

112
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:33,122
Then, with a surge of emotion,
he felt like strangling her,

113
00:11:33,508 --> 00:11:36,924
to set her straight,
then and there.

114
00:11:37,512 --> 00:11:38,792
The other one too.

115
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,098
Bump both of them off...

116
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:42,969
Bump them off?

117
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:46,520
Yes! Rid them of the taste..
The bad taste for provoking me.

118
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,848
Just a second.
What on earth are you thinking?

119
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:53,854
Thinking about that again?
Stop it right now!

120
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,734
Stop thinking about it, please!

121
00:11:58,077 --> 00:12:00,318
There, calm down, Georges pal.

122
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:04,496
You know what it has cost you
in the past.

123
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,120
So calm down, all right?

124
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,543
What will I do with her?

125
00:12:14,094 --> 00:12:17,131
I have her name, address,
and so her number,

126
00:12:17,515 --> 00:12:20,184
if she has a phone...
of course she has.

127
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,517
Everybody has a phone.

128
00:12:23,063 --> 00:12:25,684
No, not the poor.
There are a lot of them.

129
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:29,274
She isn't poor:
flying costs a lot.

130
00:12:30,738 --> 00:12:33,739
Even so, she'll need to be
in the phone book.

131
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:36,777
I can call her and say...

132
00:12:38,497 --> 00:12:39,872
Let's see...

133
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,363
say to her...

134
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,373
Well...

135
00:12:45,338 --> 00:12:46,452
My name is

136
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:49,419
Georges Palet.
Have you lost something?

137
00:12:50,384 --> 00:12:51,380
You have. What?

138
00:12:53,221 --> 00:12:55,973
A wallet. And?

139
00:12:56,391 --> 00:12:57,305
No, not that.

140
00:12:58,393 --> 00:12:59,722
Say...

141
00:13:00,688 --> 00:13:01,388
I know...

142
00:13:02,523 --> 00:13:05,559
My name is Georges Palet.
Have you lost something?

143
00:13:05,943 --> 00:13:06,810
You have?

144
00:13:08,071 --> 00:13:09,482
Hello, I'd like to...

145
00:13:09,865 --> 00:13:11,691
or may I, or could I,

146
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:15,448
or could I possibly...
or rather,

147
00:13:16,247 --> 00:13:18,572
Could I talk to
Marguerite Muir?

148
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,960
No... to Miss Muir.
To Miss Marguerite Muir!

149
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:23,869
So say to her...

150
00:13:24,506 --> 00:13:26,415
I know...

151
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,795
No, I don't know.

152
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,465
I want to talk to Miss Muir.

153
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:32,554
Speaking?

154
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:35,054
Well, hello, Miss. Madam?

155
00:13:36,603 --> 00:13:39,639
That's what I feared.
What?

156
00:13:40,356 --> 00:13:42,314
Nothing.

157
00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:43,809
"Who are you?"

158
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:47,359
Well my name is...

159
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,277
No spare her the name.
Just tell her...

160
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,661
I'm calling you because...

161
00:13:54,956 --> 00:13:57,993
Because what?
"Who is this?"

162
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,788
Georges had come back to call.

163
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,874
He no longer had the right to leave.

164
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:42,166
He had no rights.

165
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:45,172
He couldn't even vote
but he didn't mind that.

166
00:14:45,512 --> 00:14:47,754
What he did mind...

167
00:14:48,265 --> 00:14:50,804
No, nothing.
He didn't mind at all.

168
00:14:51,602 --> 00:14:53,180
Well, yes, what he did mind...

169
00:14:55,064 --> 00:14:58,149
No, lets not even think about it,
if possible.

170
00:15:17,672 --> 00:15:20,544
If only he could have forgotten it.

171
00:15:20,926 --> 00:15:22,337
He wished he could.

172
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,463
He'd waited his whole life

173
00:15:25,974 --> 00:15:28,050
to stop thinking at, last

174
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,758
about anything.

175
00:15:30,145 --> 00:15:33,099
And that's what he expected.
Thinking of her,

176
00:15:33,607 --> 00:15:35,896
would have been
like thinking of nothing.

177
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,497
It's her, my god, it's her!

178
00:16:32,673 --> 00:16:35,626
You're dreaming, pal.
It can't be her.

179
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:38,543
You fool, she doesn't even know you.

180
00:16:40,097 --> 00:16:41,757
For her, you don't even exist.

181
00:16:44,643 --> 00:16:47,764
I've been trying to reach you
for an hour now!

182
00:16:48,148 --> 00:16:50,271
I doubt it, I'm just starting.

183
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,228
Starting what?

184
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,273
Go on. Starting What?

185
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:57,529
Calling.

186
00:16:57,908 --> 00:16:59,189
Calling whom?

187
00:17:00,745 --> 00:17:01,943
-The woman with the wallet.

188
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,160
-What woman?

189
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,371
What wallet?
What are you talking about?

190
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,668
I don't know yet.

191
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:10,797
Why did you call?

192
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:17,715
Something wrong?

193
00:17:19,891 --> 00:17:22,561
Don't you feel well?
Want me to come?

194
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:28,601
I'm busy, but if you aren't well,
I'll come.

195
00:17:28,984 --> 00:17:31,025
There's no need.
Why did you call?

196
00:17:31,446 --> 00:17:32,192
-Tell me first.

197
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:33,318
No you first.

198
00:17:33,698 --> 00:17:34,729
No, you!

199
00:17:35,992 --> 00:17:37,156
What woman?
What wallet?

200
00:17:37,578 --> 00:17:39,036
I'll explain.

201
00:17:39,455 --> 00:17:41,946
No, no, explain now.
You sound odd.

202
00:17:42,374 --> 00:17:44,368
- Me, odd?
- Yes.

203
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:46,205
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

204
00:17:46,629 --> 00:17:51,042
I went to change my watch battery
and found a wallet.

205
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:54,926
I'm trying to call the girl.
She must be worried.

206
00:17:56,014 --> 00:17:58,720
It's needling me, see.
I need to reassure her.

207
00:17:59,936 --> 00:18:01,975
But it hasn't been an hour yet.

208
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,688
So, why did you call?

209
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:06,810
About the lawn.

210
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,981
What about the lawn?

211
00:18:15,536 --> 00:18:18,027
The children are coming on Sunday.

212
00:18:18,414 --> 00:18:19,659
I didn't know.

213
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,084
I'd like you to mow the lawn.

214
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,490
Anybody there?

215
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,209
Anybody there?

216
00:19:13,976 --> 00:19:15,636
What are you doing?

217
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,051
I called out.

218
00:19:17,438 --> 00:19:21,270
Back to the other side, please.

219
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,610
What's it about?

220
00:19:29,576 --> 00:19:31,865
Could you close the door?
We can't hear each other.

221
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,748
are you injured?
Were you attacked?

222
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,828
To steal my wallet?

223
00:19:42,216 --> 00:19:43,461
For example.

224
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:46,880
So, were you attacked?

225
00:19:47,262 --> 00:19:51,724
No, I dislocated my shoulder
trying to get my mower started.

226
00:19:52,643 --> 00:19:54,802
Electric, electric,
that's the best.

227
00:19:56,148 --> 00:20:00,608
A wire, a plug...
No nasty smells, no noise.

228
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:04,190
Yes, but
people have been electrocuted.

229
00:20:04,574 --> 00:20:07,195
They run over the wire and boom,
or so I've heard.

230
00:20:07,535 --> 00:20:10,323
Perhaps, but I was only saying.

231
00:20:10,706 --> 00:20:11,571
Yes.

232
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,159
yes. Anyhow, why are you here?

233
00:20:15,544 --> 00:20:18,000
Bernard, are you coming or not,
damn it?

234
00:20:19,382 --> 00:20:20,295
Well?

235
00:20:20,675 --> 00:20:22,335
A celebration?

236
00:20:22,718 --> 00:20:24,296
A promotion.

237
00:20:25,263 --> 00:20:26,343
I'll be going.

238
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:28,051
No, stay!

239
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:30,925
What were you here for?

240
00:20:31,353 --> 00:20:34,058
Yes, I was here for...

241
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:37,308
Could you close the door, please?

242
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,185
Just a minute.

243
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,315
So? You were here for?

244
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,077
What's going on?
Why did you leave like that?

245
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:56,457
You turn up, you leave...
What's going on?

246
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,128
Come on now!

247
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:02,720
Come with me.

248
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:07,135
Look at me.
You were here for a reason?

249
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:08,134
Yes.

250
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,477
So tell me all about it.

251
00:21:17,446 --> 00:21:19,024
Something to drink?

252
00:21:19,406 --> 00:21:20,521
No, thank you.

253
00:21:22,242 --> 00:21:24,615
All right. I'm listening.

254
00:21:26,581 --> 00:21:29,072
Actually, I've found a wallet.

255
00:21:30,335 --> 00:21:32,375
You have it here?

256
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:36,673
Of course but you know...

257
00:21:38,303 --> 00:21:39,002
What?

258
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:42,462
Nothing.

259
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:51,979
Here it is.

260
00:21:55,238 --> 00:21:57,693
Where did you find it?

261
00:21:58,074 --> 00:22:00,233
In the shopping centre car park.

262
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:01,532
Any money in it?

263
00:22:01,912 --> 00:22:03,322
No.

264
00:22:10,087 --> 00:22:12,543
No, in that photo, it's true...

265
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,295
But look at the other.

266
00:22:14,676 --> 00:22:16,301
There's that too?

267
00:22:17,095 --> 00:22:18,210
look.

268
00:22:18,847 --> 00:22:20,222
I guess.

269
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,135
-She looks like Helene Boucher.

270
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:23,841
Who?

271
00:22:24,228 --> 00:22:26,470
An aviatrix from the thirties.

272
00:22:27,398 --> 00:22:30,602
Paris-Saigon solo,
seven world records

273
00:22:31,403 --> 00:22:33,111
fatally injured

274
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,856
during a training flight.
You know your stuff.

275
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,819
I read about her as a boy.

276
00:22:40,246 --> 00:22:42,998
Leave me your phone number
and address

277
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:44,917
just in case.

278
00:22:45,335 --> 00:22:46,414
There may be a reward.

279
00:22:46,795 --> 00:22:48,170
A reward? What reward?

280
00:22:48,713 --> 00:22:50,207
For the...

281
00:22:51,133 --> 00:22:56,424
Are you going to let her know?
Tonight?

282
00:22:56,889 --> 00:23:00,970
Tonight it's a little late.
What's your name?

283
00:23:02,353 --> 00:23:06,304
Palet.
Georges Palet. P-A-L-E-T.

284
00:23:06,692 --> 00:23:07,522
Palet.

285
00:23:08,777 --> 00:23:10,355
Georges.

286
00:23:11,196 --> 00:23:12,228
Your address?

287
00:23:12,615 --> 00:23:15,865
He recognized me, I can see
he has. It'll come back to him.

288
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,281
What do I do? Kill him?

289
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,990
And what's your phone number?

290
00:24:13,182 --> 00:24:14,925
Thank you for doing the lawn.

291
00:24:17,186 --> 00:24:19,061
If that's all it takes
to make you happy.

292
00:24:23,068 --> 00:24:24,099
Something wrong?

293
00:24:32,161 --> 00:24:34,450
The wallet... Did you take it in?

294
00:24:34,831 --> 00:24:36,622
Yes but I'm worried.

295
00:24:37,417 --> 00:24:39,623
I wanted to reassure her myself.

296
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,251
Wouldn't you worry
if you lost all your papers?

297
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:45,748
You bet.

298
00:24:46,969 --> 00:24:48,547
But what can you do?

299
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,682
You took it to the police.

300
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:53,600
Did it go well?

301
00:24:53,977 --> 00:24:55,258
Why?

302
00:24:55,771 --> 00:24:59,934
No reason. They'll let her know.
Don't worry.

303
00:25:01,485 --> 00:25:04,321
Yes, but after how long?

304
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:12,528
How long will it take? I'd have
let her know right away. You Know?

305
00:25:12,915 --> 00:25:14,029
Yes.

306
00:25:14,499 --> 00:25:16,208
One point in my favor.

307
00:25:23,594 --> 00:25:25,218
It's ridiculous to wait.

308
00:25:25,596 --> 00:25:27,339
So try again.

309
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:12,764
Calling someone?

310
00:26:13,982 --> 00:26:16,272
Yes, that woman.

311
00:26:16,652 --> 00:26:18,194
This late?

312
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:30,698
How do I look?

313
00:26:31,085 --> 00:26:31,749
Very Nice.

314
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:33,787
Sure? Not too much make-up?

315
00:26:34,171 --> 00:26:35,369
No you look lovely.

316
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:40,465
Put the meat on.
They'll be here soon.

317
00:26:40,845 --> 00:26:43,882
-It has to get going.
-Put it on anyway.

318
00:26:44,266 --> 00:26:46,259
Fine but it won't cook.

319
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,951
Do you think Elodie is happy?
Yes, she is.

320
00:27:10,336 --> 00:27:13,671
They have two children:
she isn't unhappy with him.

321
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,211
Then again, with her,
you never can tell.

322
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:22,390
I find Elodie's husband very kind.
A decent guy.

323
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:28,811
Look, they're here!

324
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:30,353
I saw them.

325
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:39,655
sweetheart!

326
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:49,035
Well,

327
00:27:49,463 --> 00:27:51,835
Are you well?
-Yes.

328
00:28:01,142 --> 00:28:02,423
How's boxing?

329
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:04,436
Training for the Championship.

330
00:28:04,814 --> 00:28:06,391
Something to drink?

331
00:28:19,914 --> 00:28:24,125
We could use "tu" now.
I'd rather not, if you don't mind.

332
00:28:25,335 --> 00:28:28,622
-Do you mind?
-No I was just asking.

333
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:33,750
Use "tu" to say what?
We're fine like this aren't we?

334
00:28:34,763 --> 00:28:36,590
Something to drink?

335
00:28:41,646 --> 00:28:44,516
Ready for seconds?

336
00:28:52,658 --> 00:28:55,150
Mum, wasn't Marcellin
supposed to come?

337
00:28:56,037 --> 00:28:58,742
We're expecting him.
No, we won't wait.

338
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:02,836
-He'll be here soon.
-With him you never can tell.

339
00:29:13,848 --> 00:29:16,137
Training for the championship.
Nice.

340
00:29:16,726 --> 00:29:20,594
What were you discussing with my father?
-I like him when he's trying to be friendly.

341
00:29:21,064 --> 00:29:22,606
But, no...

342
00:29:22,983 --> 00:29:25,819
My father's like that.
Aren't you dad?

343
00:29:28,698 --> 00:29:31,319
Mum, wasn't Marcellin, supposed to come?
-You know how it is with him...

344
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:43,161
It's nice to have a garden.

345
00:29:45,424 --> 00:29:46,919
Hi, everybody.

346
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,633
I'll get it.

347
00:30:27,096 --> 00:30:27,926
Hello?

348
00:30:28,305 --> 00:30:30,263
May I speak to Georges Palet?

349
00:30:30,642 --> 00:30:32,136
Dad, it's for you.

350
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:43,105
-Who is it?
-Some lady.

351
00:30:44,364 --> 00:30:45,694
- She didn't give her name?
- No

352
00:30:46,075 --> 00:30:49,658
What did she say?
She asked for Georges Palet.

353
00:30:50,037 --> 00:30:51,413
That's you, right?

354
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:55,491
Yes you fool, or you wouldn't be
Marcellin Palet.

355
00:30:55,877 --> 00:30:57,455
Nothing to be proud of.

356
00:31:05,721 --> 00:31:06,469
Hello.

357
00:31:06,848 --> 00:31:07,963
Yes?

358
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:11,300
I'm listening.

359
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:14,938
Actually...
I'm calling because

360
00:31:15,316 --> 00:31:16,644
Because what?

361
00:31:17,026 --> 00:31:18,686
To thank you.

362
00:31:19,695 --> 00:31:20,894
What for?

363
00:31:21,365 --> 00:31:24,899
Just a second...
Didn't you find my wallet?

364
00:31:25,994 --> 00:31:26,907
Yes.

365
00:31:27,287 --> 00:31:29,577
All right then, thank you.

366
00:31:32,543 --> 00:31:33,124
Is that all?

367
00:31:33,502 --> 00:31:34,831
What else?

368
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:38,462
I don't know. You could...

369
00:31:38,842 --> 00:31:40,301
I could what?

370
00:31:43,055 --> 00:31:44,466
I don't know...

371
00:31:44,974 --> 00:31:46,634
Feel like meeting me.

372
00:31:47,017 --> 00:31:49,306
What for? i don't see any need to.

373
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,557
I'm not surprised.

374
00:31:52,941 --> 00:31:55,229
- What?
- I'm not surprised.

375
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:58,019
- Listen
- No I won't listen.

376
00:31:58,989 --> 00:32:00,365
You disappoint me.

377
00:32:03,494 --> 00:32:07,409
What's wrong with Dad?
He's...

378
00:32:09,042 --> 00:32:12,209
I don't know, what could be wrong with him?
He should take up a sport.

379
00:32:16,925 --> 00:32:20,011
Near the tennis courts,
george realized

380
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,506
he was perhaps doing something stupid.

381
00:32:22,891 --> 00:32:24,717
Something not quite right.

382
00:32:27,187 --> 00:32:29,643
Come down to the club one day.

383
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,766
To see a fight.

384
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:34,730
If you're interested.

385
00:32:36,531 --> 00:32:38,570
My father's like that.

386
00:32:40,076 --> 00:32:41,357
Aren't you dad?

387
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:49,837
I wanted to tell you that I'm ashamed

388
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:52,707
of the way I acted over the phone.

389
00:32:55,343 --> 00:32:57,467
let's see where she lives.

390
00:34:24,734 --> 00:34:27,688
I wanted to tell you that I'm ashamed

391
00:34:28,071 --> 00:34:30,229
of the way I acted over the phone.

392
00:34:30,657 --> 00:34:34,157
So ashamed I fell ill on a Sunday.

393
00:34:35,454 --> 00:34:40,876
Suzanne had to send for a Sunday doctor
at the Sunday rate.

394
00:34:42,128 --> 00:34:44,417
I can't tell her that.
I'ts not possible.

395
00:34:45,424 --> 00:34:47,333
She mustn't read it.

396
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,802
I don't want her to read it.

397
00:35:01,608 --> 00:35:03,684
What on earth are you doing?

398
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,563
You'll break it my boy.

399
00:35:08,366 --> 00:35:11,485
Who are you anyway?
What are you doing here?

400
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:13,743
I've never been here before and...

401
00:35:14,121 --> 00:35:14,904
And what?

402
00:35:16,124 --> 00:35:19,575
And I've never done this before,
but I must

403
00:35:19,961 --> 00:35:21,372
get my letter back.

404
00:35:21,797 --> 00:35:23,078
Can you help?

405
00:35:23,466 --> 00:35:26,632
My dear fellow,
even if I wanted to, I cant.

406
00:35:27,803 --> 00:35:29,179
Is it serious?

407
00:35:29,556 --> 00:35:32,972
Serious? No, what is serious?
no it's not serious.

408
00:35:34,018 --> 00:35:35,217
I'd prefer

409
00:35:35,645 --> 00:35:36,393
that she didn't read it.

410
00:35:36,772 --> 00:35:38,183
It is serious then.

411
00:35:41,026 --> 00:35:42,189
Do you know her?

412
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:44,312
By sight.

413
00:35:45,824 --> 00:35:46,855
What's she like?

414
00:35:48,785 --> 00:35:51,193
I mean... in real life?

415
00:35:53,123 --> 00:35:54,534
Don't you talk?

416
00:35:55,334 --> 00:35:57,576
Hello now and then

417
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:01,130
If you see her,

418
00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:04,126
could you tell her...

419
00:36:22,114 --> 00:36:24,071
You have a letter,
from a gentleman.

420
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:25,231
What gentleman?

421
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:27,741
- He didn't say his name.
- Really?

422
00:36:28,121 --> 00:36:31,371
No, he just said
that he forbade you to read it.

423
00:36:31,749 --> 00:36:33,825
- Fancy, and why?
-I don't Know.

424
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,168
- Give it to me.
-Are you joking?

425
00:36:36,546 --> 00:36:39,750
-I have to tear it up
-It's mine.

426
00:36:40,884 --> 00:36:43,293
She didn't add "now".

427
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,174
But she thought of it.

428
00:37:04,161 --> 00:37:08,372
she read it. She didn't die of it.
One doesn't die of that.

429
00:37:08,748 --> 00:37:11,916
Reading never killed anyone.
It helps you live.

430
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,152
She replied.

431
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:43,159
She replied very kindly.
A couple of words, three lines,

432
00:37:43,537 --> 00:37:45,079
a quarter page...

433
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:49,115
"I consider

434
00:37:50,253 --> 00:37:52,329
"the matter closed

435
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:58,469
"everyone makes mistakes

436
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:00,721
"its part of our lot

437
00:38:01,098 --> 00:38:04,717
"to get ideas".

438
00:38:06,187 --> 00:38:09,474
It needed more than that to
discourage old Georges.

439
00:38:10,692 --> 00:38:12,151
He kept writing

440
00:38:12,528 --> 00:38:15,149
about what he believed his life to be.

441
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:17,281
He ended up believing it.

442
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:19,734
No, he believed it.

443
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:23,488
He wrote it, so he believed it.
One has to believe to write.

444
00:38:23,873 --> 00:38:28,286
And it's so real
one ends up believing.

445
00:38:30,922 --> 00:38:34,090
"I don't know
if I've already told you...

446
00:38:35,011 --> 00:38:37,299
yes, I have already told you.

447
00:38:37,972 --> 00:38:42,967
I've already spoken
about my old passion

448
00:38:43,353 --> 00:38:45,096
for flying.

449
00:38:46,774 --> 00:38:49,977
I shared that with my father.

450
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:54,816
He dreamed of being a pilot

451
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:58,451
but ended up a motorcycle mechanic.

452
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:02,115
Motorcycles don't fly.

453
00:39:09,591 --> 00:39:13,719
We buried my father a week ago.

454
00:39:15,723 --> 00:39:19,257
I wonder what I can talk about.

455
00:39:22,021 --> 00:39:27,312
My mother is threatening suicide.

456
00:39:28,403 --> 00:39:30,396
I don't dare ca...

457
00:39:36,787 --> 00:39:37,903
She read his words

458
00:39:38,915 --> 00:39:40,991
but didn't reply

459
00:40:24,882 --> 00:40:27,883
- Untranslated subtitle -

460
00:40:28,261 --> 00:40:32,259
Two messages.
First Message.

461
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:34,384
It's Josepha.
The prosthodontist called.

462
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:36,596
he won't be ready tomorrow.
He's sorry. Take care.

463
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:41,606
It's me again. You're never home.
I wanted to talk to you...

464
00:40:42,193 --> 00:40:46,108
about everything and nothing.
But not about nothing.

465
00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:47,948
As if we were having a drink.

466
00:40:48,325 --> 00:40:50,069
Georges called every evening.

467
00:40:50,453 --> 00:40:53,572
She was never home.
The machine always answered.

468
00:40:53,956 --> 00:40:55,534
Answering machines do that.

469
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:59,915
I heard my father saying that
my mother tried to kill herself.

470
00:41:00,297 --> 00:41:02,704
I went to the hospital where I was born.
When I came over she said

471
00:41:03,091 --> 00:41:07,919
"spare me that look.
You'd never have the guts".

472
00:41:08,305 --> 00:41:10,927
I call that a desire for murder.
Don't you?

473
00:41:11,266 --> 00:41:15,099
well, I must dash.
I have to put the ravioli on.

474
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,769
No more messages

475
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:32,446
One evening, he surprised her.

476
00:41:32,832 --> 00:41:34,660
He caught her without her machine on.

477
00:41:35,044 --> 00:41:37,748
She was there, in person, for once.

478
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:38,829
Hello?

479
00:41:39,214 --> 00:41:41,124
Oh. it's you...

480
00:41:41,551 --> 00:41:45,418
I'm very glad to speak to you

481
00:41:45,805 --> 00:41:47,216
- Because...
- Because what?

482
00:41:49,768 --> 00:41:51,926
I;m asking you, begging you,

483
00:41:52,312 --> 00:41:54,554
not to write to me,
to leave me alone.

484
00:41:54,982 --> 00:41:56,014
Leave me in peace.

485
00:41:56,401 --> 00:41:59,188
No, that's impossible.
Am I at peace?

486
00:42:00,488 --> 00:42:03,359
Not since I got to Know you.

487
00:42:04,493 --> 00:42:07,494
Why refuse to see me?
It won't ki...

488
00:42:07,871 --> 00:42:09,199
eat you!

489
00:42:57,384 --> 00:42:59,626
I wanted to make you stay.

490
00:43:00,012 --> 00:43:04,011
To delay you, talk to you.
I couldn't find a better way.

491
00:43:04,392 --> 00:43:07,144
You know, I'm not an evil man.

492
00:43:07,687 --> 00:43:09,597
When I realized what I'd done,
I panicked.

493
00:43:09,982 --> 00:43:11,725
I'm running away.

494
00:43:13,235 --> 00:43:15,441
But first...

495
00:43:15,864 --> 00:43:19,067
I want you to know
that I'm the one who slashed you.

496
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:20,482
No!

497
00:43:20,868 --> 00:43:22,826
The one who did this to you.

498
00:43:31,339 --> 00:43:32,917
She had made up her mind.

499
00:43:33,299 --> 00:43:34,959
She was going to the police.

500
00:43:38,013 --> 00:43:40,848
This is Marguerite Muir.

501
00:43:41,558 --> 00:43:42,673
Do you remember me?

502
00:43:43,101 --> 00:43:44,346
I remember.

503
00:43:45,146 --> 00:43:46,688
I came about...

504
00:43:47,065 --> 00:43:48,607
I remember very well.

505
00:43:49,025 --> 00:43:50,768
You have a good memory.

506
00:43:52,905 --> 00:43:55,905
We have it here for you you.

507
00:43:56,283 --> 00:43:57,742
from 8 to 12 and from 2 to 5

508
00:43:58,118 --> 00:44:00,871
I'm so pleased. I'm on my way.

509
00:44:14,887 --> 00:44:16,381
I'm the person.

510
00:44:17,014 --> 00:44:19,932
You called. I'm here for my wallet.

511
00:44:20,601 --> 00:44:23,010
Perhaps it wasn't you I spoke to.

512
00:44:23,396 --> 00:44:24,428
Yes, it was.

513
00:44:25,065 --> 00:44:26,096
It was me.

514
00:44:27,525 --> 00:44:28,605
This way.

515
00:44:33,491 --> 00:44:35,364
You have it then?

516
00:44:40,915 --> 00:44:42,244
Where did you lose it?

517
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:44,999
I didn't lose it, it was stolen.

518
00:44:45,379 --> 00:44:46,790
My bag was snatched.

519
00:44:47,172 --> 00:44:48,999
Oh!
Wait...

520
00:44:49,508 --> 00:44:52,214
Do you have my bag too?
I'm afraid no.

521
00:44:52,971 --> 00:44:54,548
Where did you find it?

522
00:44:55,181 --> 00:44:58,634
The thief emptied out your bag.
He found nothing.

523
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:02,763
He got rid of the bag.
He took the bus.

524
00:45:03,607 --> 00:45:05,101
Why the bus?

525
00:45:05,485 --> 00:45:08,486
He emptied the wallet.
He found the money.

526
00:45:08,863 --> 00:45:10,238
Was there money in it?

527
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,700
Three fifty-euro notes.

528
00:45:13,369 --> 00:45:15,491
He dumped the wallet
in the car park.

529
00:45:15,871 --> 00:45:18,658
Which car park?
the shopping centre one.

530
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:21,912
Which shopping centre?
In L'Hay-les-Roses.

531
00:45:22,295 --> 00:45:24,702
Yes, I know where that is.

532
00:45:26,132 --> 00:45:28,458
That's so far from where I live.

533
00:45:28,844 --> 00:45:32,295
He probably spent it all
on CDs and tapes.

534
00:45:32,681 --> 00:45:34,259
Yes that's possible.

535
00:45:35,476 --> 00:45:36,757
well, anyway,

536
00:45:37,937 --> 00:45:39,846
sign here.

537
00:45:41,733 --> 00:45:44,403
And in future...

538
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,904
I'd like to know
who found my wallet.

539
00:45:53,287 --> 00:45:55,909
I'd like to thank the person.

540
00:45:56,708 --> 00:46:00,373
Mr Palet, Georges.

541
00:46:00,754 --> 00:46:02,830
What's he like? As a man?
Just being curious.

542
00:46:03,215 --> 00:46:05,707
Is he young or Old?
Just being curious.

543
00:46:06,093 --> 00:46:08,335
Please, It's only natural.

544
00:46:09,847 --> 00:46:12,006
An individual aged around fifty,

545
00:46:12,392 --> 00:46:14,219
average height, slim,

546
00:46:14,603 --> 00:46:18,103
almost white hair, with eyes,

547
00:46:18,482 --> 00:46:20,439
let me see...

548
00:46:20,818 --> 00:46:23,356
light-coloured, yes,
very light, kind eyes.

549
00:46:23,737 --> 00:46:26,276
But odd.
A lined face.

550
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:30,572
Something must have wasted him.
an illness, or a big problem.

551
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,829
But a very big problem.

552
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,575
In short, an odd fellow indeed.

553
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,747
I didn't understand all he said.

554
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:40,714
But the main thing is...

555
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,377
You said it.

556
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:45,965
You have a good memory.

557
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:47,337
But, no...

558
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:52,549
What's the problem?
Have you been attacked again?

559
00:46:52,978 --> 00:46:55,766
Not exactly.
That's why I wanted to se you.

560
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:57,270
What's wrong?

561
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:58,646
Nothing too serious

562
00:46:59,068 --> 00:47:02,319
but it's taking on
such proportions...

563
00:47:02,948 --> 00:47:06,447
I thought that maybe
I could stop by to see you.

564
00:47:07,077 --> 00:47:09,699
Of course, but tell me what's wrong.

565
00:47:10,623 --> 00:47:13,375
Well, this fellow,
this man, this gentleman...

566
00:47:13,751 --> 00:47:16,242
The gentleman who found my wallet...

567
00:47:16,672 --> 00:47:18,545
Yes, what about him?

568
00:47:19,299 --> 00:47:20,462
This is so awkward...

569
00:47:20,884 --> 00:47:22,213
Is he demanding a reward?

570
00:47:22,844 --> 00:47:24,921
In a way, yes.

571
00:47:25,348 --> 00:47:26,462
How do you mean, in a way?

572
00:47:28,643 --> 00:47:29,971
Is he...

573
00:47:30,394 --> 00:47:33,562
propositioning you?

574
00:47:33,941 --> 00:47:36,858
-No... Well yes ... well no.
-Is he threatening you?

575
00:47:37,235 --> 00:47:38,481
Oh, you're getting on my nerves.

576
00:47:39,697 --> 00:47:40,527
Pardon me?

577
00:47:40,948 --> 00:47:41,648
He's demanding to see me.

578
00:47:42,575 --> 00:47:43,405
And?

579
00:47:43,826 --> 00:47:44,608
He wants to know me.

580
00:47:44,994 --> 00:47:45,777
That's all?

581
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:47,491
He keeps writing to me.

582
00:47:47,914 --> 00:47:48,661
He'll calm down.

583
00:47:49,082 --> 00:47:50,411
He won't. Yesterday Morning...

584
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:51,913
What happened?

585
00:47:53,212 --> 00:47:54,623
He came to my street.

586
00:47:57,591 --> 00:47:59,418
He slashed the tires on my car.

587
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:02,252
Now that changes everything.

588
00:48:03,723 --> 00:48:05,681
That's much more serious.

589
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:07,803
You must come in to see us.

590
00:48:08,229 --> 00:48:12,273
That's what I want to do,
but not to press charges.

591
00:48:12,691 --> 00:48:14,601
You have to make a statement

592
00:48:15,028 --> 00:48:18,195
I don't want any trouble.
He's probably a decent man.

593
00:48:18,573 --> 00:48:21,029
I'd just like you to talk to him

594
00:48:21,451 --> 00:48:23,030
Is that possible?

595
00:48:23,454 --> 00:48:25,078
Can you do that?

596
00:48:30,712 --> 00:48:33,084
And repaint the attic door too.

597
00:48:33,465 --> 00:48:36,169
You know, the dormer window.
Understand?

598
00:48:37,636 --> 00:48:39,759
You see what I mean?

599
00:48:42,683 --> 00:48:43,596
Well sorry.

600
00:48:43,977 --> 00:48:46,265
Forgive me. that's not what I meant.

601
00:48:46,646 --> 00:48:48,105
I'm late, I had a bad night.

602
00:48:48,481 --> 00:48:49,644
You'll do it then?

603
00:48:50,024 --> 00:48:51,603
-I can count on you?
-Yes.

604
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,903
See that plane?

605
00:48:57,574 --> 00:48:59,947
That's a Cessna Skylane.

606
00:49:00,828 --> 00:49:05,241
230 horsepower,
270 km/h at top speed.

607
00:49:06,919 --> 00:49:08,995
1700 Km on a full tank.

608
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:15,798
And put some newspaper down.
For the drops of paint.

609
00:49:35,701 --> 00:49:37,610
Come in, it's not locked!

610
00:49:45,378 --> 00:49:47,417
Is it my wife?

611
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:50,626
No, no, don't worry.
We just want a word.

612
00:49:51,051 --> 00:49:52,213
I'll come down.

613
00:49:57,308 --> 00:49:58,719
Do you recognize me?

614
00:49:59,101 --> 00:50:00,595
Of course. I didn't from above.

615
00:50:00,978 --> 00:50:04,313
It's the cap. But now I do.

616
00:50:04,691 --> 00:50:06,019
Repainting the house?

617
00:50:06,401 --> 00:50:09,936
My wife wants to change
the gate and the door.

618
00:50:10,321 --> 00:50:11,567
The rest has to match.

619
00:50:12,491 --> 00:50:15,278
With something new in something old,

620
00:50:15,661 --> 00:50:18,662
in an old house I mean,
you have to replace everything.

621
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:21,705
It's true. You have no choice.

622
00:50:22,585 --> 00:50:24,661
The previous stuff,

623
00:50:25,046 --> 00:50:27,716
the old stuff,
soon becomes unbearable.

624
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:32,800
You should just grow old
and let it grow old with you.

625
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:36,175
-But my wife...
-Are you married?

626
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,639
For thirty years now.
I even have grandchildren.

627
00:50:41,523 --> 00:50:46,102
But I see this will take a while.
We'd better sit down.

628
00:50:46,987 --> 00:50:49,479
-Coming?
-Lead the way.

629
00:50:58,125 --> 00:50:59,121
Come in.

630
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:09,344
Let me tidy up.

631
00:51:10,305 --> 00:51:13,639
-Something to drink? -No thanks
-You Neither?

632
00:51:14,017 --> 00:51:14,717
No.

633
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,936
All right.

634
00:51:17,313 --> 00:51:19,104
But, if you don't mind...

635
00:51:20,066 --> 00:51:21,975
I'll have a quick one.

636
00:51:22,902 --> 00:51:24,895
Have a seat.

637
00:51:54,312 --> 00:51:55,854
It's good to sit down.

638
00:51:56,231 --> 00:52:00,015
Being up a ladder
wears your legs out,

639
00:52:00,402 --> 00:52:02,063
keeping yourself steady.

640
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,991
I'm afraid of falling
of hurting myself,

641
00:52:07,576 --> 00:52:09,202
of surviving.

642
00:52:09,788 --> 00:52:13,572
My right foot really aches.
I must have hurt myself.

643
00:52:13,958 --> 00:52:16,201
I was steadying myself with it.

644
00:52:16,587 --> 00:52:17,666
Let me take a look.

645
00:52:18,088 --> 00:52:19,369
Oh!

646
00:52:19,965 --> 00:52:21,376
Seen this?

647
00:52:23,178 --> 00:52:24,209
Ha!

648
00:52:26,764 --> 00:52:29,053
Do you remember the wallet?

649
00:52:29,434 --> 00:52:30,893
You bet I remember it!

650
00:52:31,687 --> 00:52:34,356
And Miss Muir, you remember her?

651
00:52:35,858 --> 00:52:37,186
Yes, her too.

652
00:52:37,819 --> 00:52:40,939
Have you met?
No, she called me last Sunday

653
00:52:41,364 --> 00:52:43,155
to thank me.

654
00:52:43,533 --> 00:52:45,242
For what, God knows.

655
00:52:45,786 --> 00:52:49,486
I couldn't talk. My daughter
was here, with her husband.

656
00:52:49,873 --> 00:52:52,661
My son too.
He doesn't have children.

657
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:56,461
He has decided not to.
I understand that.

658
00:52:57,131 --> 00:52:58,923
To reproduce what?

659
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:03,763
We couldn't talk much.

660
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,972
I mean, her and me.

661
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:08,889
She thanked me and that was that.

662
00:53:15,027 --> 00:53:16,402
I see.

663
00:53:17,863 --> 00:53:19,487
Have you heard from her since?

664
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:21,859
Why would I?

665
00:53:22,285 --> 00:53:23,779
-You could have.
-Yes, you could have.

666
00:53:24,161 --> 00:53:25,490
-Yes you could have.
-It happens.

667
00:53:25,871 --> 00:53:28,327
-You get acquainted.
-You talk, calk back.

668
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:29,574
-Or write.
-Yes, or write.

669
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,917
-Yes, or write.
-Did you write to her?

670
00:53:32,337 --> 00:53:32,953
No!

671
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,126
You get acquainted.

672
00:53:34,547 --> 00:53:35,081
You talk.

673
00:53:35,507 --> 00:53:36,042
You call back.

674
00:53:36,467 --> 00:53:36,964
Or write.

675
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:39,588
-Or write.
-Yes, or write.

676
00:53:40,179 --> 00:53:41,128
Did you write to her?

677
00:53:41,555 --> 00:53:42,469
No!

678
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:44,765
You get acquainted.
You call back.

679
00:53:45,185 --> 00:53:46,134
You write.
Yes you write.

680
00:53:46,561 --> 00:53:47,972
Yes, or write.
Did you write to her?

681
00:53:48,396 --> 00:53:48,977
No!

682
00:53:51,984 --> 00:53:52,980
Listen.

683
00:53:53,652 --> 00:53:55,111
We're here to help you.

684
00:53:55,487 --> 00:53:57,610
To stop you doing anything stupid.

685
00:53:58,033 --> 00:54:01,816
Something stupid?
Do I look as if I would?

686
00:54:02,912 --> 00:54:05,451
Look at the state I'm in.

687
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:07,584
If I could,

688
00:54:08,002 --> 00:54:09,081
do you know what I'd do?

689
00:54:09,461 --> 00:54:09,959
No.

690
00:54:10,337 --> 00:54:13,173
The same thing my old neighbor did!

691
00:54:13,925 --> 00:54:16,594
On the dole at 50.
Married, two kids.

692
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:19,841
He blew his brains out.
Boom! Bang!

693
00:54:21,517 --> 00:54:24,802
His wife remarried.
They're redoing the house.

694
00:54:25,187 --> 00:54:27,097
see what that means?

695
00:54:28,983 --> 00:54:30,359
It means...

696
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:36,151
Oh, damn it.

697
00:54:38,952 --> 00:54:40,861
Listen, all that's very sad.

698
00:54:41,246 --> 00:54:44,948
But Miss Muir came to see us.
She told us everything.

699
00:54:49,173 --> 00:54:51,331
That's not possible.

700
00:54:52,426 --> 00:54:54,881
-She didn't do that. Not her!
-She did!

701
00:54:56,848 --> 00:54:58,425
The bitch.

702
00:54:58,975 --> 00:55:00,932
I mean it, what a bitch!

703
00:55:09,069 --> 00:55:10,897
I didn't mean her any harm.

704
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,774
Neither did she.

705
00:55:13,157 --> 00:55:14,900
She didn't file a complaint.

706
00:55:15,284 --> 00:55:18,405
She isn't even asking you
to refund her costs.

707
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:20,995
She just wants to be left alone.

708
00:55:21,374 --> 00:55:23,700
She has requested us
to ask you that.

709
00:55:24,085 --> 00:55:25,878
So I'm asking you.

710
00:55:26,881 --> 00:55:28,161
Will you?

711
00:55:30,426 --> 00:55:34,175
Shit, shit,
I'm sick of this bloody life.

712
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:38,548
-well is the answer yes?
-Yes, yes.

713
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:40,347
-You promise?
-Yes.

714
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:42,769
Can we count on you?

715
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:47,148
-Yes.
-No worries then?

716
00:55:50,073 --> 00:55:51,448
I said yes.

717
00:55:51,825 --> 00:55:53,283
There you go.

718
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:03,997
That's a fine paint job.

719
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,539
a beautiful colour,
isn't Bernard?

720
00:56:06,925 --> 00:56:10,591
Don't you like it?
Doing everything in blue?

721
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:17,684
Ouch!

722
00:56:18,938 --> 00:56:21,892
-It's nearly over now.
-Go ahead.

723
00:56:24,778 --> 00:56:27,400
You're hurting me.

724
00:56:28,907 --> 00:56:30,283
It's over.

725
00:56:31,077 --> 00:56:32,275
You can rinse.

726
00:56:35,373 --> 00:56:38,328
I never promised
you'd get your milk teeth back.

727
00:56:41,463 --> 00:56:43,041
Look how handsome you are.

728
00:56:43,423 --> 00:56:46,840
-Like at the barber's.
-I was about to say something stupid.

729
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:50,386
-What?
-No it's too silly.

730
00:56:50,765 --> 00:56:51,630
Say it anyway.

731
00:56:52,016 --> 00:56:55,137
I was going to say,
I can smile at you now.

732
00:56:55,687 --> 00:56:58,012
I was even going to say
next time too.

733
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:00,933
But there won't be a next time.

734
00:57:01,903 --> 00:57:04,109
But you'll be back, won't you?

735
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:09,157
No more visions
of you bending down over me

736
00:57:09,536 --> 00:57:11,861
to fill my teeth...
-How sweet.

737
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,458
Off you go now. It's late.

738
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,665
Meet Josepha Belotch.

739
00:57:57,463 --> 00:57:59,837
Doctors Muir and Belotch.

740
00:58:00,217 --> 00:58:02,838
Two old friends.
Inseparable.

741
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:06,839
Pastimes:Josepha, the theater,
Marquierite, aviation.

742
00:58:07,225 --> 00:58:08,470
A world.

743
00:58:08,851 --> 00:58:09,765
A gaping chasm.

744
00:58:10,144 --> 00:58:12,516
And their view of men.

745
00:58:12,897 --> 00:58:14,096
Why the smile?

746
00:58:14,525 --> 00:58:16,648
It's old Schwer.

747
00:58:17,069 --> 00:58:19,904
Another last-minute decider.

748
00:58:20,281 --> 00:58:22,903
It changes nothing,
but it gets on my nerves.

749
00:58:24,619 --> 00:58:27,489
he made a very pretty declaration
before he left.

750
00:58:27,873 --> 00:58:29,248
oh!

751
00:58:30,959 --> 00:58:35,421
By the way, any news of your..
your brutish suitor?

752
00:58:38,259 --> 00:58:40,417
No. No more news.

753
00:58:40,887 --> 00:58:43,557
You sound as if...
Yes that's how it is.

754
00:58:44,308 --> 00:58:46,596
I'm sorry I acted the way I did.

755
00:58:46,977 --> 00:58:50,643
I'm worried he'll get into trouble.

756
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,199
All right, I'm coming.

757
00:59:43,623 --> 00:59:45,829
I'm disturbing you.
It's very late.

758
00:59:47,878 --> 00:59:50,962
I hope I didn't wake you.

759
00:59:51,632 --> 00:59:53,174
Is this Miss Muir?

760
00:59:54,009 --> 00:59:55,125
Yes.

761
00:59:56,387 --> 00:59:58,427
But how on earth did you know?

762
01:00:00,058 --> 01:00:01,137
The voice...

763
01:00:02,728 --> 01:00:03,593
The voice.

764
01:00:03,979 --> 01:00:06,055
I still don't understand.

765
01:00:10,069 --> 01:00:12,062
Georges talks to me a lot about it.

766
01:00:12,947 --> 01:00:14,406
He describes it,

767
01:00:14,782 --> 01:00:17,820
and believe me,
Georges can be very precise.

768
01:00:18,745 --> 01:00:19,410
And...

769
01:00:25,169 --> 01:00:26,913
And I was really hoping...

770
01:00:29,257 --> 01:00:31,498
I can tell you, since you're there.

771
01:00:33,387 --> 01:00:35,593
It's just the two of us, two women.

772
01:00:38,058 --> 01:00:39,339
I was hoping you'd call.

773
01:00:39,811 --> 01:00:40,925
Why?

774
01:00:41,729 --> 01:00:42,927
Why were you hoping that?

775
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:51,978
May I talk to him?

776
01:00:52,407 --> 01:00:54,401
Probably, but not now.
He isn't here.

777
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:57,279
Where is he?

778
01:00:57,705 --> 01:00:58,618
At the cinema.

779
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:02,625
An old war film
near the Place d'Italie.

780
01:01:03,378 --> 01:01:07,672
About a US Navy pilot
during the Korean war.

781
01:01:09,093 --> 01:01:10,801
The Bridges at Toko-Ri.

782
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:14,423
The pilot, shot down,
has to be brought back at any cost.

783
01:01:14,807 --> 01:01:17,429
His pal comes for him by helicopter.

784
01:01:17,811 --> 01:01:20,811
The Koreans wait for it to land.
The two men reunite.

785
01:01:21,189 --> 01:01:25,733
No shelter. Gunfire.
The Koreans kill them both.

786
01:01:29,908 --> 01:01:31,070
I'll call back.

787
01:01:45,258 --> 01:01:47,749
The film ends in half an hour or so.

788
01:02:29,849 --> 01:02:33,716
"it's not far from here" thought Muir.
What if I waited for him?

789
01:02:34,061 --> 01:02:35,306
Marguerite had half an hour or so.

790
01:02:35,689 --> 01:02:38,643
She didn't have any doubts.

791
01:02:38,984 --> 01:02:41,142
She knew she'd recognize Georges.

792
01:02:41,528 --> 01:02:44,234
Without ever having seen him?
Yes.

793
01:04:02,492 --> 01:04:04,071
Here's your coffee.

794
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:15,041
Thank you.

795
01:04:27,813 --> 01:04:28,844
A double espresso.

796
01:04:29,231 --> 01:04:30,606
At this hour.

797
01:04:57,345 --> 01:04:58,508
Exiting the cinema

798
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:00,424
nothing surprises you.

799
01:05:01,349 --> 01:05:02,299
Anything can happen.

800
01:05:02,685 --> 01:05:05,389
It doesn't surprise you.

801
01:05:05,729 --> 01:05:08,516
Anything can happen
as naturally as possible.

802
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,125
You love me, then?

803
01:06:08,925 --> 01:06:10,419
No, no.

804
01:06:12,637 --> 01:06:13,550
It's just...

805
01:06:14,138 --> 01:06:15,135
What?

806
01:06:17,142 --> 01:06:18,885
Don't look like that...

807
01:06:19,436 --> 01:06:20,515
What?

808
01:06:20,896 --> 01:06:21,976
Nothing.

809
01:06:22,815 --> 01:06:23,894
Well...

810
01:06:26,444 --> 01:06:29,564
I was saying: it's just...

811
01:06:32,325 --> 01:06:34,117
I was worried about you

812
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:39,364
That's right. deep Down,
you can worry without loving.

813
01:06:40,751 --> 01:06:41,949
Can't you?

814
01:06:46,716 --> 01:06:48,543
Yes, why not?

815
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:52,546
But can one love without worrying?

816
01:06:58,020 --> 01:06:58,970
Yes, that too.

817
01:06:59,439 --> 01:07:01,313
How did you know I was here?

818
01:07:01,691 --> 01:07:03,814
-Your wife.
-Ah, yes, my wife.

819
01:07:04,194 --> 01:07:06,768
-A kind woman, isn't she?
-She's more than that.

820
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:10,398
Yes, well.

821
01:07:12,119 --> 01:07:15,287
-What do you want exactly?
-To have coffee with you.

822
01:07:29,973 --> 01:07:32,345
it feels odd to be walking together.

823
01:07:32,683 --> 01:07:35,555
You've barely met.
You've spoken on the phone.

824
01:07:35,896 --> 01:07:37,805
Let's call it speaking.

825
01:07:38,148 --> 01:07:40,306
You'd given up hope of meeting.

826
01:07:40,901 --> 01:07:43,607
And now you're walking together.

827
01:07:43,946 --> 01:07:45,405
Not very straight.

828
01:07:46,532 --> 01:07:49,700
You could almost take
each others arm.

829
01:08:16,982 --> 01:08:19,309
How was the film?

830
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,565
is that all?

831
01:08:23,114 --> 01:08:25,785
I was a boy when I first saw it.

832
01:08:26,118 --> 01:08:27,032
Really?

833
01:08:28,621 --> 01:08:29,652
And?

834
01:08:29,997 --> 01:08:32,405
Nothing, it did nothing for me.

835
01:08:33,543 --> 01:08:37,292
Not even the two friends' death.
war is like that,

836
01:08:37,672 --> 01:08:39,297
don't you think?

837
01:08:40,384 --> 01:08:41,795
What about you, then?

838
01:08:44,013 --> 01:08:45,175
The planes?

839
01:08:49,227 --> 01:08:52,228
I don't have much time at the moment,

840
01:08:52,564 --> 01:08:54,640
but I hope to fly again soon.

841
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:59,277
perhaps not next Sunday, but soon.

842
01:09:02,742 --> 01:09:04,023
You should come.

843
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:05,655
With your wife.

844
01:09:07,372 --> 01:09:08,237
With my wife?

845
01:09:08,581 --> 01:09:11,618
Yes. I'm sure she'd like it.

846
01:09:13,212 --> 01:09:14,670
With my wife.

847
01:09:16,632 --> 01:09:18,874
-I see.
-You see what?

848
01:10:32,591 --> 01:10:34,500
Dr. Muir is not here?

849
01:10:34,843 --> 01:10:38,427
She's been held up.
Please come in.

850
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,788
Thank you.

851
01:11:11,551 --> 01:11:13,093
Because of Georges,

852
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:14,336
that conversation.

853
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:17,597
You sweep aside
the important reasons.

854
01:11:17,933 --> 01:11:19,724
You focus on details.

855
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:24,639
For instance? instead of thinking
"why did i go there for?"

856
01:11:25,024 --> 01:11:26,602
"what I was doing there?"

857
01:11:26,943 --> 01:11:29,102
You think: "my hair
didn't look good."

858
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:32,106
"Perhaps he didn't like my nose."

859
01:11:32,449 --> 01:11:36,150
he looked at it as if he'd never
see it again.

860
01:11:37,288 --> 01:11:39,993
"I hope he didn't see my teeth."

861
01:11:40,499 --> 01:11:42,659
"Did he notice my feet?"

862
01:11:43,045 --> 01:11:44,420
What's going on?

863
01:11:44,796 --> 01:11:45,792
Nothing.

864
01:11:46,131 --> 01:11:47,625
Are you ill?

865
01:11:48,008 --> 01:11:50,630
No... well, I don't think so.

866
01:11:51,012 --> 01:11:54,215
A patient asked if you were ill.
It surprised me.

867
01:11:54,598 --> 01:11:55,678
It's astounding.

868
01:11:56,058 --> 01:11:57,601
Seriously. What's going on?

869
01:11:57,936 --> 01:11:58,683
Nothing.

870
01:11:59,020 --> 01:11:59,886
How do you mean?

871
01:12:00,605 --> 01:12:02,645
Nothing, okay.

872
01:12:03,024 --> 01:12:03,938
What about your patients?

873
01:12:04,317 --> 01:12:07,402
I couldn't care less.

874
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:10,022
Really? Couldn't care less.
But honey...

875
01:12:10,366 --> 01:12:12,940
No patients, no money.
No money, no plane.

876
01:12:13,328 --> 01:12:14,870
Have you thought of that?

877
01:12:16,581 --> 01:12:19,287
Let's think about it.
she had bought an old Spit.

878
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:20,955
A spitfire.

879
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:25,043
Dating from the war.
In need of renovation but a beauty.

880
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:28,630
With Mickey and a few others.
Five with Mickey.

881
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:30,595
All crazy about engines.

882
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:33,172
They needed 60,000 euros,
peanuts

883
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:36,138
and a pilot.
Muir volunteered.

884
01:12:36,478 --> 01:12:37,937
The boys applauded.

885
01:12:38,272 --> 01:12:41,190
Not only for the money.
They knew how Marguerite flew.

886
01:12:41,526 --> 01:12:43,815
They had seen her at work.

887
01:12:44,153 --> 01:12:45,945
Me too.

888
01:13:04,301 --> 01:13:06,673
I'll pick you up at one.

889
01:13:19,192 --> 01:13:20,307
Thank you.

890
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:33,324
Why don't you use your knife?

891
01:13:33,875 --> 01:13:35,667
What's wrong?

892
01:13:47,766 --> 01:13:48,964
Is that him?

893
01:13:51,353 --> 01:13:51,969
Is that him?

894
01:13:53,021 --> 01:13:54,018
Yes.

895
01:13:55,441 --> 01:13:56,520
I see.

896
01:13:57,651 --> 01:13:59,691
I'll talk to him, you'll see.

897
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:00,984
Oh, no, don't.

898
01:14:01,364 --> 01:14:02,479
Stay here.

899
01:14:02,866 --> 01:14:04,443
Oh Lord, I'm tipsy.

900
01:14:07,996 --> 01:14:09,408
Leave her alone.

901
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:11,989
Who?

902
01:14:27,601 --> 01:14:29,724
Come on. we're leaving.

903
01:15:29,170 --> 01:15:32,040
Ladies and gentlemen,
the show is about to begin.

904
01:15:35,134 --> 01:15:36,843
What a talent. Genius.

905
01:15:37,179 --> 01:15:40,630
The show is about to begin.
Take your places.

906
01:15:40,974 --> 01:15:41,720
What? Were you talking to me?

907
01:15:42,058 --> 01:15:44,431
If Georges had been here...

908
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:46,562
Don't start that again.

909
01:15:46,897 --> 01:15:49,435
I want to see him, you hear?
I have to.

910
01:15:49,775 --> 01:15:52,611
-What do you mean?
-Don't worry about it.

911
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,193
I'll call him.

912
01:15:54,531 --> 01:15:55,645
Call him tomorrow.

913
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:59,906
No, not tomorrow.
I want to see him now.

914
01:16:00,538 --> 01:16:03,704
At this hour?
Are you out of your mind?.

915
01:16:33,532 --> 01:16:35,193
Could I speak to Georges?

916
01:16:36,077 --> 01:16:38,319
-Is this Miss Muir?
-Yes.

917
01:16:41,709 --> 01:16:44,496
It's very late,
but could I talk to him?

918
01:16:44,878 --> 01:16:46,207
He's out.

919
01:16:46,588 --> 01:16:48,581
-At the cinema again?
-No.

920
01:16:48,967 --> 01:16:49,962
-I have to talk to you.

921
01:16:50,301 --> 01:16:51,843
to me?

922
01:16:52,637 --> 01:16:53,633
Now? But...

923
01:16:54,013 --> 01:16:56,766
-Please. It won't take long.

924
01:16:57,684 --> 01:17:00,222
well, if you really think so.
Why not?

925
01:17:30,512 --> 01:17:33,430
It's absurd.
What will you say to her?

926
01:17:33,766 --> 01:17:35,889
Don't worry. Wait here.

927
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:56,703
You are exactly as I pictured you.

928
01:17:57,917 --> 01:18:00,622
Let's have a cup of tea, shall we?

929
01:18:33,332 --> 01:18:35,787
Couldn't you park better than that?

930
01:18:37,044 --> 01:18:39,002
I'd like to get through to my house.

931
01:18:42,925 --> 01:18:45,333
So, it's you.

932
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:48,546
What are you doing here?
Waiting for me?

933
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:51,464
No, I'm waiting for Marguerite.
-Really?

934
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:55,061
Your car, honestly...

935
01:18:58,901 --> 01:19:00,444
You, on the other hand...

936
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:04,776
let me release you.

937
01:19:50,291 --> 01:19:51,917
Bringing them home now?

938
01:19:52,253 --> 01:19:53,830
Of course not

939
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:56,088
She's Marguerite's friend.

940
01:19:59,052 --> 01:20:01,969
What's your name again?
-Josepha.

941
01:20:02,805 --> 01:20:05,047
Excuse me,
I'm parched.

942
01:20:05,391 --> 01:20:07,100
Could I have a glass of water?

943
01:20:07,478 --> 01:20:08,592
Of course.

944
01:20:11,773 --> 01:20:13,767
Come with me to the kitchen.

945
01:20:38,053 --> 01:20:39,796
What are you doing in my home?

946
01:20:40,138 --> 01:20:41,680
Oh, no.

947
01:20:42,015 --> 01:20:45,515
Don't shout because if you do
I'll start shouting too.

948
01:20:45,853 --> 01:20:48,142
And we can't start shouting.

949
01:20:53,445 --> 01:20:54,725
By the way, how was it?

950
01:20:56,991 --> 01:21:00,324
Not bad.
Futile but not bad.

951
01:21:03,205 --> 01:21:04,866
I could see her coming.

952
01:21:05,917 --> 01:21:08,539
I knew she'd try to have me
one of these days.

953
01:21:08,879 --> 01:21:11,120
I made the first move.
That way it's settled.

954
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:17,176
Go now. I never
want to see you again.

955
01:21:29,276 --> 01:21:30,439
You understand?

956
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:44,993
You're hurting me.

957
01:21:49,049 --> 01:21:50,875
You're hurting me.

958
01:21:57,808 --> 01:21:59,516
Same time Thursday?

959
01:22:00,102 --> 01:22:03,306
You hurt me all the same.
See you Thursday.

960
01:22:15,327 --> 01:22:16,406
You're hurting me.

961
01:22:19,582 --> 01:22:20,578
Ouch!

962
01:22:22,001 --> 01:22:23,543
You're hurting me.

963
01:22:26,924 --> 01:22:28,382
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

964
01:22:31,094 --> 01:22:32,506
You're hurting me.

965
01:22:32,889 --> 01:22:35,380
Stop it!
You're hurting me.

966
01:22:38,769 --> 01:22:40,514
Close your mouth now.

967
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,745
Someone will take care of you.

968
01:23:00,835 --> 01:23:04,881
There's a patient in my office.
Could you finish up?

969
01:23:07,635 --> 01:23:08,881
I'll be in touch.

970
01:23:10,138 --> 01:23:11,929
But where are you going?

971
01:23:12,557 --> 01:23:15,013
Where are you going?
For God's sake, tell me!

972
01:23:51,058 --> 01:23:52,434
Miss Muir?

973
01:23:53,269 --> 01:23:56,603
Is that you? Is it really you?

974
01:23:56,939 --> 01:23:58,731
How long has it been?

975
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:01,107
I've come to see it.
Can you let me in?

976
01:26:28,649 --> 01:26:32,814
Three, four...
Margot,  greet the moon

977
01:26:33,196 --> 01:26:36,565
greet the sun
and the stars for me.

978
01:26:36,908 --> 01:26:40,076
Take off, the aircraft flies away

979
01:26:40,413 --> 01:26:44,078
above the hangars and the rooftops

980
01:26:44,417 --> 01:26:47,335
Margot, greet the moon

981
01:26:47,671 --> 01:26:53,175
greet the sun and the stars for me.

982
01:26:53,593 --> 01:26:54,922
It's us!

983
01:26:58,682 --> 01:27:00,474
Oh Lord, they're so silly...

984
01:27:00,809 --> 01:27:02,602
You can't be so silly.

985
01:27:02,938 --> 01:27:05,642
Oh, you're top-notch mechanics,

986
01:27:05,982 --> 01:27:08,307
but you;re four fools.
Four idiots.

987
01:27:09,737 --> 01:27:12,691
But. I'm fond of you,
really very fond.

988
01:27:13,032 --> 01:27:14,146
Give me a kiss.

989
01:27:15,909 --> 01:27:17,155
What about me?

990
01:27:19,831 --> 01:27:21,076
Oh, no!

991
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:22,614
No way!

992
01:27:25,462 --> 01:27:27,419
What do you say, boys?

993
01:27:27,756 --> 01:27:29,963
Shall we let her drink her coffee?

994
01:27:42,105 --> 01:27:43,386
Hi, Josepha?

995
01:27:52,450 --> 01:27:54,443
Stop it. I'm right there

996
01:27:56,455 --> 01:27:58,163
-Hadn't you seen me?

997
01:27:58,498 --> 01:28:00,622
I had. Well no.
I shouldn't have?

998
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,996
Will it wear the bell out?
You're thinking of the bill?

999
01:28:04,338 --> 01:28:06,461
Do you want me to chip in?

1000
01:28:06,799 --> 01:28:08,425
Seriously, do you want me to?

1001
01:28:08,802 --> 01:28:10,510
Carry on, you interest me.

1002
01:28:10,846 --> 01:28:13,681
There's a start to everything.
Are you gardening?

1003
01:28:15,017 --> 01:28:16,761
What do you want?

1004
01:28:17,103 --> 01:28:18,930
I've come to fetch you.

1005
01:28:19,272 --> 01:28:21,727
Me? What for? To go Where?

1006
01:28:23,110 --> 01:28:26,229
Not just you,
I wouldn't have come otherwise.

1007
01:28:27,405 --> 01:28:30,241
I'll ask again.
What for? to go where?

1008
01:28:31,911 --> 01:28:32,907
There.

1009
01:28:33,954 --> 01:28:34,820
Where?

1010
01:28:35,748 --> 01:28:37,658
Where? You're making me

1011
01:28:38,043 --> 01:28:39,869
repeat all my questions?

1012
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:42,211
I repeat: Where is there?

1013
01:28:42,714 --> 01:28:44,375
Where Marguerite is.

1014
01:28:45,885 --> 01:28:46,419
Who?

1015
01:28:46,802 --> 01:28:49,673
Cut the crap. She sent me here.

1016
01:28:50,014 --> 01:28:52,553
-To do what?
-To drive you there.

1017
01:28:52,934 --> 01:28:55,425
-Where?
-To the field.

1018
01:28:57,021 --> 01:28:57,721
-What for?

1019
01:28:58,106 --> 01:28:59,934
She's flying and wants you...

1020
01:29:00,317 --> 01:29:01,349
well, Suzanne and you...

1021
01:29:05,447 --> 01:29:06,693
Ah, it's you.

1022
01:29:07,742 --> 01:29:11,277
I wondered who you were talking to.
-To her.

1023
01:29:12,288 --> 01:29:15,243
Miss Muir
would like to take us flying.

1024
01:29:15,584 --> 01:29:17,126
What do you think?

1025
01:29:19,213 --> 01:29:21,005
That's an excellent idea.

1026
01:29:23,176 --> 01:29:25,464
No sooner said than done.

1027
01:29:26,137 --> 01:29:29,305
Sit in the sun and we'll be
all yours in five minutes.

1028
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:39,145
Miss Muir is flying.

1029
01:29:39,527 --> 01:29:41,187
She's taken someone up
for a first flight.

1030
01:29:41,529 --> 01:29:42,941
A baptism.

1031
01:29:43,282 --> 01:29:45,570
No, a discovery flight.

1032
01:29:45,909 --> 01:29:48,578
We don't say first flight.

1033
01:29:48,912 --> 01:29:51,119
It's a discovery flight these days.

1034
01:29:51,457 --> 01:29:54,791
We'll wait for her on the field.
We'll see you later.

1035
01:29:55,545 --> 01:29:56,921
Don't forget,

1036
01:29:57,256 --> 01:30:00,007
I'm expecting you all for lunch,
no later than one.

1037
01:30:00,342 --> 01:30:02,465
My veal stew won't wait.

1038
01:30:02,803 --> 01:30:04,049
You too, of course.

1039
01:30:09,435 --> 01:30:11,475
Don't be too long.

1040
01:30:32,085 --> 01:30:33,414
Have you seen? A spitfire.

1041
01:30:34,296 --> 01:30:35,707
Just think! It's a Spit.

1042
01:30:36,048 --> 01:30:37,507
-If you say so.
-I'll take a look.

1043
01:30:37,842 --> 01:30:40,962
Stay here or I'm going,
I'm cold enough as it is.

1044
01:30:41,304 --> 01:30:42,964
All right, calm down.

1045
01:30:45,767 --> 01:30:46,881
There she is.

1046
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:52,101
She's beginning her turn.
You see her?

1047
01:31:01,117 --> 01:31:04,452
-I need to take a leak.
-Over there, in the offices.

1048
01:31:06,957 --> 01:31:08,617
I need to take a leak.

1049
01:31:08,959 --> 01:31:10,454
Delighted to hear it!

1050
01:32:37,725 --> 01:32:39,302
Come on.

1051
01:32:42,563 --> 01:32:45,019
Well? Was that fun?

1052
01:32:50,905 --> 01:32:52,104
Thank you.

1053
01:32:55,119 --> 01:32:57,028
Did you like it?

1054
01:33:16,476 --> 01:33:18,302
Isn't Georges here?

1055
01:33:19,896 --> 01:33:22,566
Hello.
I'll give you a kiss.

1056
01:33:23,609 --> 01:33:26,313
-Your husband hasn't come?
-He's in the little boy's room.

1057
01:33:26,653 --> 01:33:27,898
I see.

1058
01:33:28,238 --> 01:33:32,284
I have to call in at the office.
I'll be right back.

1059
01:34:14,832 --> 01:34:18,283
I was afraid you wouldn't come.

1060
01:34:33,519 --> 01:34:36,723
We have to go, don't we?
Yes.

1061
01:34:53,499 --> 01:34:54,875
Want to sit in the front?

1062
01:34:55,209 --> 01:34:56,290
No you.

1063
01:34:56,628 --> 01:34:58,704
-Sit in the front.
-No I said.

1064
01:35:05,596 --> 01:35:07,174
-You're not coming?
-Certainly not.

1065
01:35:07,557 --> 01:35:09,099
You go without me.

1066
01:36:42,245 --> 01:36:44,996
-You want to take over?
-Oh, no please.

1067
01:36:45,332 --> 01:36:48,499
I'm here, there's no danger.
I'll be watching him

1068
01:36:48,836 --> 01:36:50,116
Well do you fancy trying?

1069
01:38:07,923 --> 01:38:09,797
Acrobatics, you don't do them here.

1070
01:38:10,134 --> 01:38:12,672
They're not allowed.

1071
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:16,973
There are special places for that.

1072
01:38:17,767 --> 01:38:21,351
Besides this plane, a Gardan
Registration F-BN YJ,

1073
01:38:21,689 --> 01:38:23,728
wasn't designed for it.

1074
01:38:24,316 --> 01:38:28,611
For acrobatics, you're wiser using
a CAP 231 Mudry, for example.

1075
01:38:30,031 --> 01:38:31,490
There.

1076
01:39:29,263 --> 01:39:30,508
Mummy?

1077
01:39:32,850 --> 01:39:33,930
Yes?

1078
01:39:34,269 --> 01:39:37,638
When I'm a cat
will I be able to eat cat munchies?
