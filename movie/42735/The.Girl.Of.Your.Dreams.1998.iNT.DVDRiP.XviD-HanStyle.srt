For the moment, there are
no extra expenses.

298
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:53,508
We saved on the taxi because
they sent a bus to pick us u p.

She" s not i n the mood.
丰迪维洛，

- 特里尼，


367
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,299
Says she can "t stomach
the Germans.

368
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:45,466
Ah, it" s because of that actor?
I can explai n that. Let me by.

369
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,375
-P lease!

Why the su rprise?

Remember the G reeks and thei r
obsession with physical beauty?

No jokes about JuLián.

Don't cry, the hotel is not far.
不要哭，酒店不远了。

436
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:27,464
Bonilla, the Jewish quarter? Didn't
you know the Germans hate them?
博尼利亚，犹太区？
你不知道德国人恨他们？

How d id I know? I don "t go

00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,566
"" If my eyes can "t see you everyday,
I'd prefer to be bl i nd. ""

446
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:43,572
"" Don "t say that my love.
I melt I i ke butter. ""

447
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:45,938

461
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,348
So, accord i ng to you, these

462
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:35,785
T al l, blonde and bl ue-eyed?
Wel l, look i n the mi rror.

463
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:39,988
Span iards are short, dark and ug ly.

00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,929

U h, what about these? You're
the artistic d i rector, rig ht?

G reat-looki ng angels, but...

00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,136

00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,794
Th is is sh it, Casti I lo.

Don "t look at

May everyone enjoy a
splend id even i ng.

507
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,433
The Doctor real ly enjoyed
"" La H ija del Cal ifa"",

508
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,742
especial ly the songs.

509
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,001
I'm lost for words.

510
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,407
The you ng lady is speech less.

511
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,273
- Well, Fontibre... how are you?
- Fontiveros...

- No kidding.
- Really.
- 别开玩笑了。
- 真的。

517
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:30,026
We happi ly sacrifice a woman's
body for planes for the Movement.

518
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,963
It is ou r patriotic d uty.

519
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:36,369
Besides, it" s an honor that
an emi nent man I i ke the doctor

U mmm...th is is from back home.

528
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:02,055
The doctor was feasti ng on
her with h is eyes.

529
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:05,600
-The girl's al l-woman.
-She may be al I woman...

530
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,302
but I don "t play second fidd le
to her or her mother.

531
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:12,102
-lt" s not her fau lt, poor th i ng.
-That was a sn u b, a real sn u b.

532
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,505
Especial ly JuLián, who" s
the real star of the fi I m.
朱利安


533
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:15,904
-Of cou rse.
-Look at her.

534
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,406
She" s sticki ng her tits

535
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:18,981
i n the poor id iot" s mouth.

536
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,550
Use what you can.

537
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,944
Don "t I have tits?
Want to see them?

538
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,817
Lucía, we" re i n
a foreig n cou ntry.

539
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,116
Th is doesn "t end here.

540
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,022
Fontiveros" I l hear from me.
Where is he? Blas!
丰迪维洛，
布拉斯！

541
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:32,163
It" s no use, Torralba.
托拉尔瓦

542
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,265
It was Dr. Goebbels h i mself
who suggested to the ambassador

543
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,028
to hold th is reception for us.

544
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,595
-The ambassador told me.
-So what?

545
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:43,931
Wel l, it" s crystal clear. The
Doctor has a crush on the I ittle one.

546
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,474
-You don "t say.
-Y es...

547
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:50,046
And the ambassador has served her
u p I i ke they used to for Fernando vl l.

548
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,647
So it was a set-u p.

549
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:53,951
Isn't Fontiveros going
to do anyth i ng?
丰迪维洛，


550
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:56,313
-What shou ld he do?
-Make the most of it.

551
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:59,423
-No, I never eat between d ri n ks.
-Span ish omelette.

552
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:10,297
M r. Torralba, why don "t you
tel I me about the fi I m?

553
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:13,562
Wel l, it" s the story of a g uerri I la
fig hter i n Sierra Morena...

554
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:17,273
-My role...
-No, not another about band its.

555
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:20,411
I'm fed u p with typical
Span ish fi I ms.

556
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:24,139
Al I that confusion, Span ish
sombreros and sidebu rns.

557
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:25,907
Typical Span ish fi I m?

558
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,314
What shou ld we do i n
Span ish ci nema then?

559
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,021
Typical German, H u ngarian,
American movies?

560
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:35,056
I don "t mean that. Compared to
foreig n fi I ms, you won "t deny that...

561
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,591
Wel l, M rs. Ambassador,

Oooh, the wou nd...

566
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,670
Please, JuLián...
朱利安

567
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:53,500
I don "t know if I dare. You're
a screen legend to me.

568
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:56,442
Legend? I'm flesh and bone.

569
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:58,411
-Noth i ng more.
-And noth i ng less.

570
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,678
Than k you.

571
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:12,529

Cheers!

574
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:33,609
The Doctor suggests you r

跟着他。

576
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,144
But l...am contracted

丰迪维洛，

577
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,070

我的发动机过热。

611
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,772
Oh, sugar, come in,
哦，糖，进来，

612
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:17,113

empty beds look so big to me.
但请记住，这只是因为空，床才看起来那么大。

朱利安

Who told th is degenerate I was

Clear, very clear. Now I'I l go

Fontiveros will love them.

丰迪维洛，

How can I concentrate

-Come on.
-No, no, no.

He says... he isn "t a clown.

No, no.

A temper? We have to

Let" s see...

737
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:55,758

00:43:58,369 --> 00:43:59,802
Are you a Jew too?

778
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:23,395

784
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:38,575
It doesn "t work I i ke that.

785
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:42,408
T o catch fish, you have to wet
you r ass. It's F ranco or the Reds.

786
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,712

794
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,212

1243
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:40,386
They shoot the fal I and then

1244
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:43,054
Besides, my wou nd...

You weren "t serious about

1277
01:23:10,418 --> 01:23:12,147
No, it was to boost morale.

O h, God. O h, God.

The war wou nd?

Wel l, it was j ust a scratch.

1326
01:26:24,546 --> 01:26:26,605
My agent exaggerated a I ittle.

01:26:26,881 --> 01:26:29,349
-For pu bl icity pu rposes, you know?
-Y eah.

How long do we have

Everybody, agai nst the wal l.

Are you Ok, Blas?
布拉斯？

1344
01:27:13,494 --> 01:27:15,394
Down, but not out.

01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:19,327
What's al I th is?
Why such harsh treatment?

What are we cri mi nals? Is al l

We're fi I m people, artists.

Th is is not ou r war.

I n Germany, we"ve done

1361
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:12,280
They're useless.

1362
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:14,478
Fontiveros,

丰迪维洛，

Nobody leave here.

We can "t move u nti I there

1366
01:28:27,035 --> 01:28:28,730
Bonilla, watch the door.

1367
01:28:28,903 --> 01:28:29,733
No one enters.

1368
01:28:30,705 --> 01:28:33,799
Macarena, you want us al I shot.
玛格莲娜

Why's he here?

1375
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:48,546
I haven "t seen anyth i ng.
I must go.

1376
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:49,754
Bonilla, nobody leaves.

1377

What cou ld I do?
Th is poor sou I needed refuge.

1382

The bastard picked the

Th is man is an artist
from ou r pictu re.

1384
01:29:09,911 --> 01:29:12,641
He's one of us.
We can "t let them shoot h i m.

1385
01:29:12,814 --> 01:29:15,806
Better they shoot h i m
and not the enti re cast.

1386
01:29:16,484 --> 01:29:20,511
You al I have no heart...
And you shou ld have less.

1387
01:29:20,788 --> 01:29:22,050
What can we do?

He's here

to take Macarena to the chalet.
玛格莲娜

O n ly her. O rders

T el I h i m to wait, vaclav.

1402
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:15,406
Now she leaves us here
i n the th ick of it.

1403
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:19,576
He says it must be at once.

But they'I l check the tru n k...

1408
01:30:38,499 --> 01:30:41,093
It's true. These Germans
are very thoroug h.

1409
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:43,236
What's he doi ng?

1410
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:50,474
What, Leo?
里奥？

1411
01:31:00,054 --> 01:31:00,986
He's al I ru bber.

1412
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:02,680
Of cou rse, he worked

1414
01:31:08,596 --> 01:31:11,588
He says close the tru n k
and take it out of here.

1415
01:31:11,933 --> 01:31:14,128
But, remember,
I "ve seen noth i ng.

1416
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:16,266
No one" s seen anyth i ng, vaclav.

01:31:42,096 --> 01:31:45,224
Dr. Goebbels will kill us if

如果她有什么事，戈培尔博士会杀了我们。

Stand back!
退后！

1430
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:16,854
Who goes there?

1431
01:32:17,932 --> 01:32:20,662
Han n i bal, it's me!

1432
01:32:21,936 --> 01:32:25,565
Where were you? Leavi ng me

Why the fuss, darl i ng?
I was looki ng for you.

1434
01:32:29,043 --> 01:32:30,305
Why the g u n?

Do you always

1436
01:32:32,847 --> 01:32:35,281
Relax, take it easy. Th is fi I m

1437
01:32:35,616 --> 01:32:37,083
Take me home at once.

01:32:37,251 --> 01:32:39,014
Right, let's not retu rn here.

1439

My poor girl. She's a heroi ne,

Poor girl...
可怜的女孩...

1448
01:33:28,769 --> 01:33:31,795
What about the Jew?
So good-looki ng...

1449
01:33:31,973 --> 01:33:35,067
Not to worry. When they shoot
you, you don "t even feel it.

1450
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:36,607
Bonilla, you brute.

Come on, let's go.
