1
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:46,400
You were late.

2
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:50,358
Next time you break out
of prison and I fly this thing.

3
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:51,608
No, thanks.

4
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:53,566
So how'd it go?

5
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,691
How it always goes.

6
00:08:57,025 --> 00:09:00,483
Good for me, bad for him.

7
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:15,358
Kravanov and Kravanov, your
father is coming to pick you up.

8
00:10:22,566 --> 00:10:22,983
What'd you do?

9
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:24,775
Me.

10
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:27,025
Nothing, I thought it was you.

11
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:27,691
No.

12
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:52,316
Where are we going, Papa?

13
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:55,066
We're in the middle of a term at school.

14
00:10:55,525 --> 00:10:55,733
Sergei.

15
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:57,525
Mom never made us do shit like this.

16
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,358
Sergei, your mother is dead.

17
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:05,316
She took all life.

18
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:09,566
She was weak, sick in her mind.

19
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:15,525
Was her choice.

20
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,191
Well, she died because you sent her away.

21
00:11:19,566 --> 00:11:19,900
No.

22
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:23,066
She gave up long ago.

23
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,816
You haven't even seen her for two years.

24
00:11:28,483 --> 00:11:31,858
Nothing will change
for you, or for you, Dmitry.

25
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,566
Where are we going, Papa? To the funeral?

26
00:11:35,608 --> 00:11:38,316
If you take on life, you
do not get the honor of funeral.

27
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:40,358
So then where are you taking us?

28
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:41,483
We go to hunt.

29
00:11:42,941 --> 00:11:44,525
There'll be no sightings of lions.

30
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:48,566
It will be good for you.

31
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:49,275
Both.

32
00:11:50,608 --> 00:11:55,441
The joined men, be one
with nature, should to kill.

33
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:57,900
Fan.

34
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:17,316
Careful with those.

35
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:20,608
Put the cards away now, Calypso.

36
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,941
Your mom and dad will be back soon.

37
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:25,691
And you know the way
they feel about all this.

38
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:27,733
It's just a game, Grammy.

39
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:30,941
You think my cards
are just pretty pictures?

40
00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:33,566
Think again, Calypso.

41
00:12:35,566 --> 00:12:38,150
They show us the unseen road.

42
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:42,316
What? Like predict the future?

43
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:45,150
Mm-hmm. In the right hands.

44
00:12:50,691 --> 00:12:52,316
Lay three cards down.

45
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:55,983
The first card is the subject.

46
00:12:57,025 --> 00:12:58,066
The high priestess?

47
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:02,566
You do come from a long
line of very powerful women.

48
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:05,608
The second card is the situation.

49
00:13:07,483 --> 00:13:08,025
The tower.

50
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,358
There's going to be a terrible accident.

51
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:16,483
The third card is the outcome.

52
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:17,941
Strength.

53
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,525
There is great danger in that card.

54
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,566
I have something for you, Calypso.

55
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:27,400
I was going to wait until you were older.

56
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:30,566
But the cards have shown
us you will need it very soon.

57
00:13:30,566 --> 00:13:32,275
What is it?

58
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:33,775
A potion.

59
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:38,650
The formula has been passed
down in our family for generations.

60
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:42,191
What does that symbol mean?

61
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,650
It's a sign of the spirit, papa ligpa.

62
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,025
He opens the gate to the other side.

63
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:50,900
Protect it.

64
00:13:52,108 --> 00:13:53,400
Very powerful.

65
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:56,316
Go ahead.

66
00:13:57,316 --> 00:14:01,358
It will heal whoever
drinks it in undreamed-of ways.

67
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:04,316
The time is coming soon.

68
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:07,275
You'll know what to do with it.

69
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:10,566
Now put those away
before your parents get back.

70
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:30,566
Well done, Nikolai.

71
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:40,608
Sergei.

72
00:14:47,566 --> 00:14:50,941
You see, it's so beautiful.

73
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:55,566
Never fear death.

74
00:14:57,358 --> 00:14:58,025
They are prey.

75
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,566
We are predators.

76
00:15:07,566 --> 00:15:12,275
Men should be only
animal that is dreaded.

77
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,858
The matry.

78
00:15:20,025 --> 00:15:20,858
Don't look so weak.

79
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:23,566
Be a man.

80
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:29,108
You all right?

81
00:15:30,358 --> 00:15:30,733
Yeah.

82
00:15:32,941 --> 00:15:34,400
You shouldn't have
talked to you like that.

83
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:36,358
Yeah, well...

84
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:39,150
He's an asshole.

85
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:41,858
There's nothing I can do about that.

86
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,150
He'll never respect
me like he respects you.

87
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,316
Wanna bet?

88
00:15:56,608 --> 00:15:58,025
I miss Ma.

89
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,816
Me too, Dima.

90
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:02,525
Me too.

91
00:16:09,691 --> 00:16:10,400
Is it the Zarr?

92
00:16:10,858 --> 00:16:12,108
Not even Pussycat.

93
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,900
Perhaps it's the
Zarr's illegitimate half-brother.

94
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:17,441
Like your Demetri.

95
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:18,483
Leave the boy.

96
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,733
He carries no blame
for his father's wandering.

97
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,566
You will know Zarr when you're here.

98
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,566
He sounds like thunder from mountaintop.

99
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:32,358
You have seen this beast?

100
00:16:33,566 --> 00:16:35,066
I have seen his work.

101
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:41,816
This cat has killed two
thousand, maybe three dozen men. Yes?

102
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,816
For as long as men like you
have been coming down here to kill lions,

103
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:50,525
there have been legends
of the one who can't be killed.

104
00:16:51,191 --> 00:16:52,150
Men like me.

105
00:16:53,566 --> 00:16:55,566
But you still take
my money, don't you, Baha'i?

106
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:59,608
A lion hunts for food.

107
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:02,066
Same as I do.

108
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:08,941
Why do you hunt Nikolai?

109
00:17:10,316 --> 00:17:11,525
You know this, Baha'i.

110
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:16,733
Men who kill legend, becomes legend.

111
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:22,983
Nikolai.

112
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,566
We should talk.

113
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:26,025
Save your pet.

114
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:28,358
No, it's a condition.

115
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:32,400
I'll be okay, as long as I
take a few breaks here and there.

116
00:17:32,941 --> 00:17:36,233
One thing that you should know about
me is that I'm always thinking of the future.

117
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,108
I want you to be my partner.

118
00:17:43,316 --> 00:17:43,941
What is your name?

119
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,066
I'm my guest here on Vladimir.

120
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:52,400
Alexey Sitzivich.

121
00:17:52,691 --> 00:17:52,900
No.

122
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,066
You do not care of name.

123
00:17:59,066 --> 00:18:01,858
In this world, you barely exist.

124
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:04,608
So what can some non-name, non-existent,

125
00:18:04,608 --> 00:18:07,775
conditioned, suffering
fool offer up to the Kravinovs?

126
00:18:09,608 --> 00:18:09,900
Nothing.

127
00:18:12,316 --> 00:18:13,066
I am here,

128
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:16,775
teaching my sons the joy of stalking.

129
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:22,566
And you and your
imbecilic voice are stalking me.

130
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:25,400
So be quiet.

131
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:36,441
Well, father gets him this time.

132
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,275
Why?

133
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:42,066
Well, because then he'll become a
legend and we don't have to come here again.

134
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:47,483
A true legend would fight fair.

135
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,233
Not with a gun.

136
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,191
You do it one on one with
only the tools you're born with.

137
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:01,650
(growling)

138
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,566
Dmitry, get back.

139
00:19:25,525 --> 00:19:35,316
(growling)

140
00:19:40,566 --> 00:19:41,941
Dmitry, move!

141
00:19:43,108 --> 00:19:43,316
Move!

142
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:48,066
Run!

143
00:19:55,483 --> 00:19:59,483
(screaming)

144
00:20:02,566 --> 00:20:03,275
Sergei!

145
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:04,483
Sergei!

146
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:07,066
Sergei!

147
00:20:24,608 --> 00:20:26,316
(screaming)

148
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,566
Calypso, look!

149
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,775
Come on, honey, stand up.

150
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:52,566
Calypso?

151
00:20:55,566 --> 00:20:55,858
Calypso!

152
00:20:59,566 --> 00:20:59,691
Calypso!

153
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:26,566
(growling)

154
00:21:54,608 --> 00:21:58,900
In the name of all the
spirits and all the mysteries...

155
00:21:59,733 --> 00:21:59,900
Mysteries...

156
00:22:03,566 --> 00:22:03,983
Help!

157
00:22:09,733 --> 00:22:12,066
Bring the power of the earth.

158
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,566
The power of the earth.

159
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:22,025
(rumbling)

160
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:24,483
Wait!

161
00:22:35,566 --> 00:22:37,566
Bring the power of the sky.

162
00:22:46,608 --> 00:22:48,275
Everybody's clear. Shocking now.

163
00:22:54,275 --> 00:22:55,816
Okay, team, we've done all we can.

164
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:59,566
I'm going to call Time of Death, 651.

165
00:23:14,608 --> 00:23:18,191
(growling)

166
00:23:32,566 --> 00:23:35,858
The EMTs found that card in your pocket.

167
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:38,816
You are one very lucky boy.

168
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,066
Thank you for saving me.

169
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,566
I wish I could say I did.

170
00:23:44,608 --> 00:23:45,900
But I didn't save him.

171
00:23:47,733 --> 00:23:48,566
I don't understand.

172
00:23:49,608 --> 00:23:50,775
That makes the two of us.

173
00:23:51,483 --> 00:23:55,233
But we're going to run some tests,
see if we can figure out what happened.

174
00:23:56,275 --> 00:23:56,483
Sergei.

175
00:23:57,983 --> 00:23:58,358
Dima.

176
00:24:05,608 --> 00:24:06,441
Why did you not shoot?

177
00:24:09,025 --> 00:24:11,566
You must be Sergei's father, Mr. Kravinov.

178
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,775
I am here to take him home.

179
00:24:15,358 --> 00:24:16,941
He needs to stay here and recover.

180
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:20,316
Clinically, he was dead
for more than three minutes.

181
00:24:21,233 --> 00:24:23,150
He will be leaving with me.

182
00:24:37,566 --> 00:24:38,566
Sergei.

183
00:24:59,991 --> 00:25:01,525
Sergei, come down here.

184
00:25:01,608 --> 00:25:11,108
Father is the only
animal that is dreaded.

185
00:25:12,566 --> 00:25:13,733
You're getting too good at that.

186
00:25:14,358 --> 00:25:14,900
He'll be all right.

187
00:25:16,108 --> 00:25:17,650
You almost got your brother killed.

188
00:25:20,108 --> 00:25:21,608
You almost got yourself killed.

189
00:25:22,233 --> 00:25:23,566
Because you were afraid.

190
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:26,483
Fear will eat you.

191
00:25:28,316 --> 00:25:29,566
It makes you weak.

192
00:25:29,566 --> 00:25:29,816
I am not a child of any kind.
I am not a child of any kind. Weak?

193
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,900
Are you weak like your mother?

194
00:25:33,691 --> 00:25:33,900
Crazy?

195
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,025
Or are you like me?

196
00:25:37,108 --> 00:25:40,066
Because if you show weakness to enemies,

197
00:25:40,441 --> 00:25:42,900
it gives them an opening.

198
00:25:44,233 --> 00:25:46,775
You are old enough to understand.

199
00:25:48,441 --> 00:25:51,233
You're not my business, yes?

200
00:25:52,816 --> 00:25:55,650
One day, you will be in charge.

201
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,900
Dimitri, go!

202
00:25:59,608 --> 00:26:01,983
Dimitri, welcome
back to school in New York.

203
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,691
And you will stay here with me.

204
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,650
I think America is making you soft.

205
00:26:10,608 --> 00:26:11,691
Just for your own good.

206
00:26:13,483 --> 00:26:15,358
Each of us have a path to walk.

207
00:26:18,108 --> 00:26:19,608
Embrace who you really are,

208
00:26:20,775 --> 00:26:22,525
and you will have
the strength to walk it.

209
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:26,150
Come.

210
00:26:28,275 --> 00:26:28,566
Come here.

211
00:26:29,566 --> 00:26:34,733
I got you something.

212
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,900
You never have to be afraid again.

213
00:26:46,525 --> 00:26:53,483
He should have killed you!

214
00:26:56,316 --> 00:27:01,108
What is going on with you?

215
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:06,566
Sergei, get back here.

216
00:27:06,566 --> 00:27:54,566
Are you okay?

217
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,666
[gunshot]

218
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:22,416
Don't leave me with him.

219
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:31,858
[gasps]

220
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:53,900
I'm going.

221
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:55,816
I have to.

222
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:56,400
Why?

223
00:28:56,858 --> 00:28:57,900
I can't explain it.

224
00:28:58,275 --> 00:28:59,400
Something's happened to me.

225
00:29:00,191 --> 00:29:01,066
What are you talking about?

226
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:03,108
Do you remember
the place we used to camp?

227
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:06,441
Where all you could hear
were the crickets and the owls.

228
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,400
And Mom used to
sing to us around the fire.

229
00:29:10,358 --> 00:29:12,108
That land is all I have left of her.

230
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:13,525
Why does that make it okay?

231
00:29:15,233 --> 00:29:16,025
Picture me there.

232
00:29:20,483 --> 00:29:20,566
I'm sorry, Dima.

233
00:29:22,858 --> 00:29:23,316
I am.

234
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:28,691
Just go, if we're gonna go.

235
00:29:31,733 --> 00:29:32,233
Go.

236
00:29:34,775 --> 00:29:37,816
I won't be gone forever.

237
00:29:42,316 --> 00:29:48,900
Where you headed?

238
00:29:50,566 --> 00:29:51,275
Trying to get out of England.

239
00:29:52,608 --> 00:29:52,858
Russia.

240
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:54,108
On this?

241
00:29:56,191 --> 00:29:57,983
You know there's
planes and trains out, don't you?

242
00:30:00,358 --> 00:30:00,858
You on the run?

243
00:30:01,691 --> 00:30:01,900
Yes.

244
00:30:03,733 --> 00:30:04,108
I am.

245
00:30:05,025 --> 00:30:06,191
Come on, then. Come on.

246
00:31:29,441 --> 00:31:32,775
[gunfire]

247
00:31:33,566 --> 00:31:34,400
Mom.

248
00:31:38,566 --> 00:31:39,566
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom.

249
00:31:52,608 --> 00:31:53,566
[birds chirping]

[music playing]

251
00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:46,275
She was weak.

252
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,150
Sick in her mind.

253
00:32:49,691 --> 00:32:50,566
She died because you sent her away.

254
00:32:50,566 --> 00:32:53,608
[shouting]

255
00:32:53,608 --> 00:32:55,566
[shouting]

256
00:32:55,566 --> 00:32:55,775
Sergei!

257
00:32:59,108 --> 00:33:00,150
Fear will eat you.

258
00:33:00,983 --> 00:33:02,108
It makes you weak.

259
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,525
Each of us has a path to walk.

260
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,400
They are brave.

261
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,566
We eat the pleasure.

262
00:34:20,566 --> 00:34:23,608

263
00:34:23,608 --> 00:34:24,108

[music playing]

273
00:36:37,566 --> 00:36:38,108
Welcome home.

274
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:40,483
We stayed under the radar as usual.

275
00:36:41,441 --> 00:36:42,525
Call me when you need me again.

276
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,566

279
00:37:13,025 --> 00:37:14,691
Sergei, it is your father.

280
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:15,858
Come home.

281
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,191
I miss you.

282
00:37:17,483 --> 00:37:19,566
I am sorry for
everything that has happened.

283
00:37:21,566 --> 00:37:22,566
Just kidding.

284
00:37:23,025 --> 00:37:23,566
It's your brother.

285
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:25,108
I texted you.

286
00:37:25,733 --> 00:37:26,275
Where have you been?

287
00:37:28,608 --> 00:37:31,108
Oh, you still
hiding out in the woods, huh?

288
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:33,650
Am I going to see you for my birthday?

289
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:35,483
Call me back.

290
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,566
[sighing]

291
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:57,691

[sirens]

293
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:34,125
Because we can.

294
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:50,666
Hey, it was leisure.

295
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,108
Because you can?

296
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:14,666
Go, go!

297
00:39:01,525 --> 00:39:02,066
Out of way.

298
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,066
There's six of us and only one of you.

299
00:39:05,775 --> 00:39:06,816
There are six of you now.

300
00:39:07,441 --> 00:39:08,858
I ain't got time for
this. I've got deadlines.

301
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:50,483
[sighing]

302
00:40:09,566 --> 00:40:09,941
Mr. Tegeler.

303
00:40:11,566 --> 00:40:12,441
I apologize.

304
00:40:13,566 --> 00:40:15,566
This guy, he came out of nowhere.

305
00:40:15,608 --> 00:40:20,150
A crazy local or... I don't know.

306
00:40:21,316 --> 00:40:22,400
But I took care of it.

307
00:40:23,316 --> 00:40:24,650
He won't be bothering us anymore.

308
00:40:29,316 --> 00:40:31,483
In a moment, you won't
be bothered by much of anything.

309
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,483
How did you...

310
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,691
Where's Mr. Tegeler?

311
00:40:37,108 --> 00:40:38,483
Oh, you're standing in him.

312
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:43,566
Found this interesting read.

313
00:40:45,775 --> 00:40:47,650
You're a poacher, Mr. Tegeler.

314
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,566
He hires poachers with these names.

315
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,941
Drugs, weapons, trafficking.

316
00:40:52,941 --> 00:40:53,608
No, no, no, I...

317
00:40:54,108 --> 00:40:54,650
What's your name?

318
00:40:56,316 --> 00:40:56,566
Andre.

319
00:40:57,025 --> 00:41:00,775
The men in that book,
they're the ones you want.

320
00:41:00,775 --> 00:41:03,233
They're the ones they
charge. I can help you find them.

321
00:41:03,983 --> 00:41:05,233
I don't need your help.

322
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:09,108
But I will be
adding these names to my list.

323
00:41:11,108 --> 00:41:11,733
Andre who?

324
00:41:14,275 --> 00:41:14,566
The maid.

325
00:41:17,483 --> 00:41:18,858
Pretty low on a pecking order, Andre.

326
00:41:20,441 --> 00:41:22,400
Oh, found you.

327
00:41:35,066 --> 00:41:40,566
And now, today's headlines.

328
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:44,733
Crusading London
prosecutor Samantha Hodges

329
00:41:44,733 --> 00:41:47,316
was gunned down
last week in broad daylight.

330
00:41:48,025 --> 00:41:52,775
Following a string of vicious attacks
targeting law enforcement and the judiciary.

331
00:41:54,441 --> 00:41:56,900
Memorial services
will be held later today.

332
00:42:02,566 --> 00:42:05,275
I met Samantha when
I first moved to London.

333
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:07,566
She was a mentor,

334
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,816
a dear friend,

335
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:17,025
and one of the fiercest fighters
for justice this city has ever known.

336
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,650
We all know who did this.

337
00:42:23,858 --> 00:42:29,191
Samantha dared to stand in Semyon
Chorny's way and hold him accountable.

338
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:34,566
And for that act of
courage, she lost her life.

339
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,608
This system's broken.

340
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,483
I'm sorry about your friend.

341
00:42:54,483 --> 00:42:54,691
Shit.

342
00:42:56,191 --> 00:42:57,316
I didn't mean to scare you.

343
00:42:57,316 --> 00:42:57,775
You did.

344
00:42:59,525 --> 00:43:00,233
Sorry for your loss.

345
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,108
Did you know her well?

346
00:43:03,816 --> 00:43:04,566
Actually, I didn't know her at all.

347
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:07,733
Well, then thank you for the condolences.

348
00:43:10,858 --> 00:43:11,358
I live so.

349
00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:22,566
I think this belongs to you.

350
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:28,775
You're...

351
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:31,566
You're the boy.

352
00:43:31,608 --> 00:43:34,358
No, you were...

353
00:43:35,525 --> 00:43:36,025
You were...

354
00:43:36,025 --> 00:43:36,483
I was.

355
00:43:37,608 --> 00:43:38,566
For three minutes.

356
00:43:39,608 --> 00:43:41,441
Would have been a whole
lot longer if you hadn't been here.

357
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,691
Those were my grandmother's cards.

358
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:47,150
I actually still carry the dick with me.

359
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:49,358
So why'd you give it to me?

360
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,358
Yes, I thought you needed it.

361
00:43:54,108 --> 00:43:55,233
Is this how you had to go on?

362
00:43:56,191 --> 00:43:56,566
How'd you find me?

363
00:43:56,608 --> 00:44:02,983
Hunting people down is sort of my thing.

364
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:04,525
Hunting?

365
00:44:05,941 --> 00:44:06,733
You know who did this?

366
00:44:08,941 --> 00:44:09,566
Yeah, I do.

367
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:12,525
They gonna get him?

368
00:44:13,858 --> 00:44:14,650
Probably not.

369
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,566
What would you say if I told you?

370
00:44:21,566 --> 00:44:24,566
I already did. (somber music)

371
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:56,441
(somber music)

372
00:44:56,441 --> 00:45:03,233
A tiger's tooth?

373
00:45:03,858 --> 00:45:05,858
I use whatever tools are available.

374
00:45:07,566 --> 00:45:08,691
Why would you do that?

375
00:45:09,566 --> 00:45:11,108
Wasn't he
responsible for killing your friend?

376
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,566
Look, I've been trying to
find you for a very long time.

377
00:45:19,233 --> 00:45:21,733
This is my way of saying
thank you for saving my life.

378
00:45:22,066 --> 00:45:23,275
I didn't ask you to murder anyone.

379
00:45:23,941 --> 00:45:24,608
I'm a lawyer.

380
00:45:28,566 --> 00:45:30,233
But that bastard got what he deserved.

381
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:36,025
I know who your father is.

382
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:38,900
You're like him?

383
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:40,983
The gangster?

384
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:41,566
No.

385
00:45:41,608 --> 00:45:48,483
I grew up watching my
father put evil into the world.

386
00:45:49,483 --> 00:45:51,150
The old man had it all figured out.

387
00:45:51,983 --> 00:45:54,441
I was supposed to follow in his footsteps

388
00:45:54,441 --> 00:45:57,066
and take over the family business.

389
00:45:58,525 --> 00:46:00,316
If something happened
to me that day, you found me.

390
00:46:03,483 --> 00:46:07,358
So, I got as far away
from my father as I could.

391
00:46:07,983 --> 00:46:09,566
Now I do what I can to
get rid of people who are not.

392
00:46:09,816 --> 00:46:12,233
Now I do what I can to
get rid of people like him.

393
00:46:13,775 --> 00:46:14,400
So you're the hunter?

394
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,775
That's just what
they call me in the press.

395
00:46:20,191 --> 00:46:21,191
I prefer Craven.

396
00:46:22,108 --> 00:46:22,441
Craven?

397
00:46:23,066 --> 00:46:24,525
Mm. With a K.

398
00:46:25,025 --> 00:46:28,108
But the only people who
have heard that name are dead now.

399
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,733
Then I guess I'll
just have to watch my back.

400
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:34,691
So do you live here?

401
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:38,566
I live about as far away as
you can possibly get from this place.

402
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:42,483
But my brother does.

403
00:46:44,941 --> 00:46:45,900
We, um...

404
00:46:49,108 --> 00:46:52,941
I wasn't always there for
him, so I check in when I can.

405
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:55,900
What about you?

406
00:46:56,941 --> 00:46:57,775
How did you end up here?

407
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,358
Some days I'm not so sure.

408
00:47:02,275 --> 00:47:06,566
My parents were
lawyers, so that's what I did.

409
00:47:06,566 --> 00:47:09,733
I was in the
D.A.'s office in New York for

410
00:47:09,733 --> 00:47:12,358
seven years, until I
couldn't take it anymore.

411
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,816
Sometimes the law can
get in the way of justice.

412
00:47:17,066 --> 00:47:17,566
It can.

413
00:47:20,275 --> 00:47:23,358
Now I'm in London, at one
of the biggest law firms in Europe.

414
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:29,025
I know where you work. You're one of
the best investigative lawyers in that place.

415
00:47:30,275 --> 00:47:31,191
I also know...

416
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,566
all your clients aren't exactly angels.

417
00:47:35,566 --> 00:47:36,691
That's true.

418
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,691
So what are you really
getting down from behind that desk?

419
00:47:43,566 --> 00:47:44,191
I have a list.

420
00:47:45,608 --> 00:47:46,066
A list?

421
00:47:51,525 --> 00:47:54,566
There are other ways to do
what you set out to do, Calypso.

422
00:48:06,816 --> 00:48:08,150
Well, you're gonna need a lawyer, or

423
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:10,358
worse, if you keep
messing around in this world.

424
00:48:13,608 --> 00:48:14,525
What about a partnership?

425
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,941
From inside that firm, you can
find people I can't. And then I can...

426
00:48:19,941 --> 00:48:20,858
Yeah, I get it.

427
00:48:26,566 --> 00:48:27,858
I'll think about it.

428
00:48:29,275 --> 00:48:29,691
Craven.

429
00:48:31,233 --> 00:48:32,191
And a little friendly advice.

430
00:48:32,608 --> 00:48:35,108
If you keep going after the names on that

431
00:48:35,108 --> 00:48:39,150
list, people you
care about are gonna get hurt.

432
00:48:49,566 --> 00:48:50,066
Hey.

433
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:51,608
Pleasure.

434
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:52,900
We need to talk about this.

435
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:53,691
Yes.

436
00:48:54,441 --> 00:48:54,983
We go again?

437
00:48:55,858 --> 00:48:56,566
Go! Go!

438
00:49:02,566 --> 00:49:03,275
Did you hear me?

439
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:05,108
Pleasure.

440
00:49:06,566 --> 00:49:07,441
Calyn, give it here.

441
00:49:08,691 --> 00:49:09,900
Are you going to make me beg?

442
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:13,775
You know I don't beg.

443
00:49:15,525 --> 00:49:16,566
You think I'm weak?

444
00:49:19,983 --> 00:49:20,941
Good damn thing.

445
00:49:24,566 --> 00:49:24,900
Pleasure!

446
00:49:25,233 --> 00:49:27,400
It's okay, Rezinka.

447
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:29,566
Yes, you're my Rezinka.

448
00:49:29,608 --> 00:49:33,400
Papa loves you. Papa forgets you.

449
00:49:33,816 --> 00:49:34,566
One more thing.

450
00:49:36,025 --> 00:49:37,900
Sami and Chauni was
killed in his prison cell.

451
00:49:40,191 --> 00:49:41,025
Who got to him?

452
00:49:41,608 --> 00:49:42,650
They're saying he was the hunter.

453
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:47,525
Faster than a cheetah, cunning as a fox.

454
00:49:49,108 --> 00:49:50,816
More ferocious than a tiger.

455
00:49:56,066 --> 00:49:56,566
Tell me.

456
00:49:57,566 --> 00:50:00,941
Do you think this hunter actually exists?

457
00:50:01,733 --> 00:50:02,525
It'd be a load of bollocks.

458
00:50:04,025 --> 00:50:05,525
But then again, I hear he's got a list.

459
00:50:06,108 --> 00:50:08,858
Once you're on it, you never come off.

460
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:13,150
And there's a good chance you're on it.

461
00:50:16,566 --> 00:50:20,108
If it is real, it can be found.

462
00:50:21,566 --> 00:50:22,316
I'll do some digging.

463
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:24,358
Wait.

464
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:29,983
Chauni's operations are up for grabs now.

465
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,066
Set a meet.

466
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:34,233
He's top three guys.

467
00:50:58,066 --> 00:51:00,858
Your boss, Sibion Chauni, is dead.

468
00:51:02,108 --> 00:51:05,733
I intend to assume
control of his acid transactions.

469
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,066
One of you will be my partner.

470
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:09,816
Who's it going to be?

471
00:51:12,275 --> 00:51:13,066
Best pitch wins.

472
00:51:20,275 --> 00:51:21,566
Why they call me the Rhino.

473
00:51:27,566 --> 00:51:30,358
Why do it to yourself?

474
00:51:32,316 --> 00:51:37,400
They have to see
who they're dealing with.

475
00:51:45,566 --> 00:51:47,733
He's back, Sibion.

476
00:51:48,191 --> 00:51:55,566
Oh, it's okay, Raja.

477
00:51:56,608 --> 00:51:57,566
It's okay.

478
00:52:26,608 --> 00:52:32,691
[sighs]

479
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:39,066
You can put your guns away.

480
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:42,191
If I want you dead,
I only have to raise my...

481
00:52:42,191 --> 00:52:42,441
Don't!

482
00:52:48,525 --> 00:52:50,025
Whenever Rhino sees his
opportunity, he doesn't hesitate.

483
00:52:51,941 --> 00:52:53,233
He charges in and takes it.

484
00:52:54,566 --> 00:52:56,775
So I'll ask one more time...

485
00:52:58,941 --> 00:53:00,691
Which one of you
is going to be my partner?

486
00:53:04,275 --> 00:53:07,525
Hell of a pitch.

487
00:53:11,566 --> 00:53:12,566
We have a winner.

488
00:53:53,608 --> 00:53:58,775
[music playing]

489
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:03,483
My son, Dimitri.

490
00:54:05,733 --> 00:54:07,400
This next one's for you, Papa.

491
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:15,900
It does for me.

492
00:54:16,483 --> 00:54:18,108
He knows I like Tony Bennett.

493
00:54:18,483 --> 00:54:19,233
Do you like Tony Bennett?

494
00:54:20,566 --> 00:54:22,358
I don't trust anyone
who doesn't like Tony Bennett.

495
00:54:25,483 --> 00:54:26,233
He can do anyone.

496
00:54:26,775 --> 00:54:27,650
He's like Chameleon.

497
00:54:30,733 --> 00:54:31,275
He's assassins.

498
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:35,400
If they can get your boss in cage,

499
00:54:36,858 --> 00:54:38,983
I think we all need to take precautions.

500
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:40,566
I understand.

501
00:54:41,983 --> 00:54:42,441
Come closer.

502
00:54:45,441 --> 00:54:47,400
Jorny, he is gone.

503
00:54:48,941 --> 00:54:51,566
That makes your
operations become vulnerable.

504
00:54:53,608 --> 00:54:57,191
I can offer you security, distribution,

505
00:54:57,983 --> 00:55:00,650
and most critically, peace of mind.

506
00:55:02,191 --> 00:55:02,566
Sounds good.

507
00:55:03,441 --> 00:55:04,025
I'm on board.

508
00:55:06,066 --> 00:55:06,608
Just like that.

509
00:55:08,275 --> 00:55:09,691
You don't want to think about it.

510
00:55:09,941 --> 00:55:11,108
Order has to be restored.

511
00:55:12,358 --> 00:55:12,983
The sooner the better.

512
00:55:16,566 --> 00:55:19,525
You have already done deal, didn't you?

513
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:20,566
Who is?

514
00:55:20,566 --> 00:55:23,233
The Rhino sends his regards.

515
00:55:50,608 --> 00:55:53,275
[yelling]

516
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:56,608
Get up.

517
00:56:15,233 --> 00:56:15,441
You're hit.

518
00:56:16,816 --> 00:56:18,316
Are you all right, Papa?

519
00:56:20,608 --> 00:56:23,525
[clinking]

520
00:56:24,566 --> 00:56:26,983
Look at what they have done to my club.

521
00:56:30,525 --> 00:56:33,650
I get attacked on my own ground.

522
00:56:35,566 --> 00:56:37,775
And who do I have to feed me?

523
00:56:38,691 --> 00:56:41,275
My son, the piano player.

524
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,441
Come on, hit me.

525
00:56:45,191 --> 00:56:45,691
Fight me!

526
00:56:47,566 --> 00:56:48,316
I need fighters.

527
00:56:48,566 --> 00:56:49,900
Look, I want...

528
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:53,275
You won't even defend yourself.

529
00:57:00,566 --> 00:57:01,733
The Kravinov hit failed.

530
00:57:02,733 --> 00:57:03,858
All of our guys are dead.

531
00:57:15,191 --> 00:57:16,566
Nikolai is a tough old bear.

532
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:18,566
He won't go quietly.

533
00:57:20,566 --> 00:57:23,525
I found these slips under my door.

534
00:57:39,275 --> 00:57:42,816
Nikolai Kravinov's
son, Sergei, is the hunter?

535
00:57:44,233 --> 00:57:45,566
But what is this, a Kravin?

536
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,816
Apparently that's what he calls himself.

537
00:57:50,275 --> 00:57:51,483
This can't be real.

538
00:57:54,316 --> 00:57:54,608
Can it?

539
00:57:55,733 --> 00:57:56,108
Not sure.

540
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,775
He put the foreigner on this.

541
00:57:59,441 --> 00:58:03,525
He is a bit of a freak, but he's
been obsessed with the hunter for years.

542
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,566
Maybe he can figure
out what the fuck is going on.

543
00:58:48,941 --> 00:58:49,150
One.

544
00:58:52,358 --> 00:58:52,483
Two.

545
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:56,150
Three.

546
00:59:07,441 --> 00:59:10,400
(gun fires)

547
00:59:18,108 --> 00:59:19,775
I'll be seeing you.

548
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:38,441
(man laughs)

549
00:59:38,858 --> 00:59:39,566
Oh, that's great.

550
00:59:39,566 --> 00:59:40,400
Is it up under the river?

551
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:09,316
(ominous music)

552
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,608
(ominous music)

553
01:00:36,608 --> 01:00:36,900
Surprise!

554
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:37,941
(man screams)

555
01:00:38,316 --> 01:00:38,483
Jesus!

556
01:00:39,441 --> 01:00:39,858
You're gay!

557
01:00:41,108 --> 01:00:42,233
(man laughs)

558
01:00:43,316 --> 01:00:45,108
You scared the shit out of me.

559
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,150
Happy birthday, baby brother.

560
01:00:49,191 --> 01:00:51,275
Love you, man.

561
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,066
What are we gonna do, huh?

562
01:00:57,316 --> 01:00:58,316
Well, you're not wearing that.

563
01:00:58,816 --> 01:00:59,983
Great, let's stay in.

564
01:00:59,983 --> 01:01:00,191
What?

565
01:01:00,816 --> 01:01:01,858
It's my birthday.

566
01:01:02,566 --> 01:01:06,608
On your birthday, we
can go to the petting zoo

567
01:01:06,983 --> 01:01:09,858
or wherever it is you let loose,

568
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:12,816
but tonight, this.

569
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,191
What makes you think I can fit in that?

570
01:01:17,191 --> 01:01:19,775
This is too big on me,
so it'd be perfect for you.

571
01:01:23,525 --> 01:01:23,691
Sorry.

572
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:24,400
Thank you.

573
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:24,900
Pleasure.

574
01:01:25,858 --> 01:01:27,025
Nice perfume, by the way.

575
01:01:27,608 --> 01:01:29,025
Thanks, but I'm not actually wearing any.

576
01:01:32,316 --> 01:01:35,358
She was gonna find out soon enough.

577
01:01:36,983 --> 01:01:39,108
(man grunts)

578
01:01:39,816 --> 01:01:41,400
Papa was sitting right here.

579
01:01:42,275 --> 01:01:43,608
It all happened so fast.

580
01:01:44,691 --> 01:01:48,191
You find out what you're
made of in a moment like that.

581
01:01:48,525 --> 01:01:49,066
I'm a coward.

582
01:01:49,358 --> 01:01:50,400
You're not a coward.

583
01:01:51,191 --> 01:01:52,775
It's natural to feel fear.

584
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:54,150
That's just your instinct, talking.

585
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:56,233
Why don't we get to choose who we are?

586
01:01:56,775 --> 01:01:58,191
Why do I have to be me?

587
01:01:58,191 --> 01:02:00,400
I need to be strong, fearless.

588
01:02:00,691 --> 01:02:01,900
I would run towards the bullets.

589
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,316
I would crumble to the ground.

590
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:05,191
You know, why would you
want to be anybody but yourself?

591
01:02:05,566 --> 01:02:07,191
So you respect me for once.

592
01:02:07,483 --> 01:02:10,191
Papa's a criminal,
so what good is his respect?

593
01:02:10,483 --> 01:02:12,108
You act like you
don't care what he thinks,

594
01:02:12,108 --> 01:02:15,400
that you're above
it, that he can't touch you.

595
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,066
Well, he can.

596
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:18,941
He made you hate people.

597
01:02:19,233 --> 01:02:20,191
I don't hate people.

598
01:02:22,316 --> 01:02:25,150
I hate what people
do, but I don't hate people.

599
01:02:27,316 --> 01:02:30,900
I guess then, Papa
was right about one thing.

600
01:02:31,483 --> 01:02:31,691
Yeah.

601
01:02:32,358 --> 01:02:32,691
Yes.

602
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,400
Men should be the
only animal that is dreaded.

603
01:02:38,316 --> 01:02:40,025
I'm glad I didn't miss the party.

604
01:02:41,525 --> 01:02:44,275
How could I stay away and miss the chance

605
01:02:44,483 --> 01:02:45,900
and see both my sons?

606
01:02:48,441 --> 01:02:48,691
Dimitri.

607
01:02:51,066 --> 01:02:51,650
What are you?

608
01:02:54,691 --> 01:02:59,358
I don't expect you to
give me a hug, but a handshake?

609
01:03:05,025 --> 01:03:07,316
(sighs)

610
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:07,483
Tasha.

611
01:03:13,233 --> 01:03:15,191
I just came for one toast,

612
01:03:15,983 --> 01:03:20,316
to honor Dimitri on his big day.

613
01:03:21,233 --> 01:03:21,441
For?

614
01:03:26,441 --> 01:03:29,066
For men, not for boys.

615
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,566
(somber music)

616
01:03:37,108 --> 01:03:37,733
Come on, Sergei.

617
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,066
The Dikrivenovs.

618
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:48,233
Maybe you'll learn
someday to forget the best

619
01:03:49,691 --> 01:03:51,775
and imagine future together.

620
01:03:53,566 --> 01:03:54,150
It's family.

621
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,108
Vashis Durovia.

622
01:03:57,025 --> 01:03:57,650
Vashis Durovia.

623
01:03:59,608 --> 01:03:59,858
(clicks tongue)

624
01:03:59,858 --> 01:04:00,400
(laughing)

625
01:04:02,858 --> 01:04:03,233
Damn you.

626
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,108
You okay?

627
01:04:11,608 --> 01:04:11,858
Sergei.

628
01:04:13,691 --> 01:04:18,441
I know why you come every year.

629
01:04:19,858 --> 01:04:26,108
Because you feel
guilty for leaving me with him.

630
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,941
I forgive you for all.

631
01:04:33,358 --> 01:04:33,983
Everything.

632
01:04:39,941 --> 01:04:40,691
I'm sorry.

633
01:04:52,441 --> 01:04:52,650
Sergei!

634
01:04:56,816 --> 01:04:57,316
Sergei!

635
01:05:27,108 --> 01:05:27,316
(dramatic music)

636
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:28,608
I never wanted to get married, did I?

637
01:05:29,858 --> 01:05:30,608
Hold that, will ya?

638
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:33,483
Please, buddy?

639
01:05:40,275 --> 01:05:41,108
Penhouse, please.

640
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:48,191
I tried to hold it for you.

641
01:05:48,191 --> 01:05:48,733
No, you didn't.

642
01:05:51,566 --> 01:05:53,775
This, oh, that's my travel knife.

643
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:54,816
Use it for work.

644
01:05:55,733 --> 01:05:55,941
Yeah.

645
01:05:57,566 --> 01:05:58,233
What'd you do for work?

646
01:05:58,775 --> 01:05:58,941
Exactly.

647
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:00,566
I hunt.

648
01:06:04,775 --> 01:06:04,983
I'm fine.

649
01:06:04,983 --> 01:06:05,191
I hunt with people.

650
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:11,150
(audio distorts)

651
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:12,900
Dimitri!

652
01:06:21,191 --> 01:06:22,358
Please, please!

653
01:06:22,983 --> 01:06:23,775
Let go, now!

654
01:06:24,941 --> 01:06:25,733
( (growling)

655
01:06:37,275 --> 01:06:41,900
[grunting]

656
01:06:49,358 --> 01:06:51,650
Hey, wait, wait, wait, stop!

657
01:06:51,733 --> 01:06:52,691
Please, please, wait, wait, wait.

658
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,275
We can figure this out.

659
01:06:54,608 --> 01:06:54,900
Put him under.

660
01:07:00,858 --> 01:07:12,108
[grunting]

661
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:14,900
There he is.

662
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:16,816
Lose him.

663
01:07:18,608 --> 01:07:19,858
Get the fuck out of the way!

664
01:07:21,816 --> 01:07:22,316
Watch it!

665
01:07:31,441 --> 01:07:34,691
[grunting]

666
01:07:34,691 --> 01:07:44,025
Fuck!

667
01:07:47,816 --> 01:07:48,358
Go!

668
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:54,525
Faster!

669
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:01,608
Stop!

670
01:08:07,525 --> 01:08:16,358
[grunting]

671
01:08:20,858 --> 01:08:22,066
The matry!

672
01:08:26,858 --> 01:08:29,358
It's bulletproof idiot inside and out!

673
01:08:31,566 --> 01:08:32,900
[knocking]

674
01:08:37,858 --> 01:08:38,733
Game off!

675
01:08:41,108 --> 01:08:44,441
[grunting]

676
01:09:02,025 --> 01:09:02,858
[grunting]

677
01:09:33,483 --> 01:09:39,275
[grunting]

678
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:45,025
[grunting]

679
01:09:45,025 --> 01:09:49,775
Go, go!

680
01:09:52,483 --> 01:09:54,066
[grunting]

681
01:10:02,733 --> 01:10:03,858
Hit!

682
01:10:30,858 --> 01:10:33,900
[grunting]

683
01:10:34,858 --> 01:10:35,191
Demon!

684
01:10:39,858 --> 01:10:40,150
Hello, sir.

685
01:10:40,608 --> 01:10:41,400
Is that something I can hook with?

686
01:10:41,858 --> 01:10:42,608
A towel, maybe.

687
01:10:43,983 --> 01:10:44,691
Thank you so much.

688
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:46,233
Appreciate it.

689
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:55,483
Sir, I think you
left your shoes in the lobby.

690
01:10:55,858 --> 01:10:56,650
I'm pretty sure it did.

691
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:58,650
Why don't we go down
and have a look together?

692
01:10:58,858 --> 01:11:00,483
I'm not sure I have enough
votes in the world then, my friend.

693
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:02,858
Brian, everything's fine.

694
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:03,525
He's a client.

695
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:05,525
What the hell, Sergei?

696
01:11:06,233 --> 01:11:08,316
I told you I'd think about your offer.

697
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:10,358
You cannot come in here like this.

698
01:11:10,983 --> 01:11:12,358
This is my place of business.

699
01:11:12,358 --> 01:11:13,150
I got my brother.

700
01:11:13,983 --> 01:11:14,858
Who got your brother?

701
01:11:15,316 --> 01:11:16,400
There were four of them.

702
01:11:17,566 --> 01:11:18,525
Took him from his place.

703
01:11:19,566 --> 01:11:20,608
So you saw them?

704
01:11:20,608 --> 01:11:21,566
There's just one guy.

705
01:11:23,191 --> 01:11:26,316
Dark hair, brown eyes,
got a scar on his left eye.

706
01:11:27,566 --> 01:11:27,941
Jesus.

707
01:11:28,983 --> 01:11:29,108
Jesus.

708
01:11:29,108 --> 01:11:29,816
You spoke to them.

709
01:11:30,358 --> 01:11:31,108
Not exactly.

710
01:11:32,858 --> 01:11:34,900
There was some screaming involved.

711
01:11:39,608 --> 01:11:39,900
Okay.

712
01:11:42,025 --> 01:11:42,983
Let's get into it then.

713
01:11:45,733 --> 01:11:47,191
I should have been there for one.

714
01:11:49,025 --> 01:11:53,483
I couldn't sleep, so I
left and went for a walk and--

715
01:11:53,858 --> 01:11:54,858
We're gonna find him.

716
01:11:56,858 --> 01:11:57,483
Okay?

717
01:11:59,191 --> 01:12:01,775
I'm gonna do what I do, get us a name,

718
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,358
and then you are going to do what you do,

719
01:12:07,566 --> 01:12:08,858
and we will get him back.

720
01:12:10,816 --> 01:12:13,608
I'm looking for a mercenary
just ran a kidnapping hop in London.

721
01:12:14,525 --> 01:12:15,900
Moonshapes, garters, left eye.

722
01:12:16,983 --> 01:12:19,025
Smokes Turkish
cigarettes, probably a national.

723
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:20,900
Find him.

724
01:12:21,858 --> 01:12:31,525
What you know, don't you?

725
01:12:31,816 --> 01:12:33,691
My list of enemies is long.

726
01:12:38,108 --> 01:12:39,566
Look what they did to him.

727
01:12:40,858 --> 01:12:45,733
(sighs)

728
01:12:51,608 --> 01:12:52,441
How much do they want?

729
01:12:53,941 --> 01:12:56,816
20 million and 48 hours.

730
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:02,358
Hey, man.

731
01:13:03,650 --> 01:13:04,316
It is complicated.

732
01:13:04,858 --> 01:13:05,650
No, it's not.

733
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:06,566
It's very simple.

734
01:13:07,733 --> 01:13:09,816
You have the money and he's your son.

735
01:13:10,483 --> 01:13:12,025
This is not about money.

736
01:13:12,650 --> 01:13:13,816
This is about power.

737
01:13:17,691 --> 01:13:20,316
If I pay, I am weak.

738
01:13:21,483 --> 01:13:24,650
If I show weakness, I begin to lose

739
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:27,066
everything I've spent lifetime building.

740
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,900
A lifetime building what?

741
01:13:30,816 --> 01:13:31,941
You're a drug dealer.

742
01:13:37,108 --> 01:13:38,233
You don't get to do that anymore.

743
01:13:39,983 --> 01:13:40,941
Dimitri is innocent.

744
01:13:41,941 --> 01:13:44,775
You let him die,
his blood is on your hands.

745
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:46,108
On my hands?

746
01:13:47,316 --> 01:13:47,900
My hands?

747
01:13:48,858 --> 01:13:50,483
I did not abandon him.

748
01:13:51,941 --> 01:13:54,150
You abandoned him.

749
01:13:55,775 --> 01:13:56,025
You?

750
01:13:59,941 --> 01:14:01,900
He was dead the moment he was taken.

751
01:14:03,233 --> 01:14:04,900
Whether I pay or not.

752
01:14:07,233 --> 01:14:09,233
No, you don't know that.

753
01:14:09,983 --> 01:14:11,733
Yes, I know.

754
01:14:12,983 --> 01:14:15,066
Because that is what I would do.

755
01:14:16,066 --> 01:14:16,608
You're despicable.

756
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:19,066
Of course I want him back.

757
01:14:21,066 --> 01:14:22,900
I want both my sons back.

758
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:28,066
Hm.

759
01:14:31,316 --> 01:14:31,400
Some legend you've become.

760
01:14:32,691 --> 01:14:37,525
Wake up.

761
01:14:40,816 --> 01:14:41,316
Take these.

762
01:14:42,691 --> 01:14:43,150
Antibiotics.

763
01:14:44,066 --> 01:14:45,400
Can't have you dying on me, can I?

764
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:57,608
Can't have you dying on me, can I?

765
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:03,400
I'm sorry. That's good.

766
01:15:35,025 --> 01:15:35,941
Omer Azdemir.

767
01:15:37,275 --> 01:15:40,108
He's holed up in the
monastery in the outskirts of Angkor.

768
01:15:41,108 --> 01:15:41,608
Thank you.

769
01:15:41,941 --> 01:15:43,983
You can thank me
by never calling me again.

770
01:15:45,025 --> 01:15:45,400
We'll see.

771
01:15:51,483 --> 01:15:54,608
How'd it go?

772
01:15:58,108 --> 01:15:59,400
She took it.

773
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:00,775
Of course she took it.
I'm sorry. Of course she took it.

774
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:02,358
But did she believe you?

775
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:04,608
Yeah, she trusts me.

776
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,858
Which is why I want
double what your boss promised.

777
01:16:10,275 --> 01:16:10,483
Double?

778
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:12,650
Why not triple?

779
01:16:14,066 --> 01:16:14,775
What game are you playing?

780
01:16:19,525 --> 01:16:19,566
One.

781
01:16:22,650 --> 01:16:22,775
Two.

782
01:16:24,775 --> 01:16:24,941
Three.

783
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,400
It's done.

784
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:38,566
[phone rings]

785
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:41,650
Get ready.

786
01:16:42,983 --> 01:16:45,650
The hunter is on his way.

787
01:16:47,441 --> 01:16:50,441
Sergei, the man you're
looking for is Omer Azdemir.

788
01:16:51,775 --> 01:16:54,525
I found an old monastery
in his family name in Turkey.

789
01:16:55,483 --> 01:16:57,691
And that is where
you'll find your brother.

790
01:16:59,525 --> 01:17:00,400
Thank you for this.

791
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:03,400
All right, Ellie. Let's go.

792
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,400
[phone rings]

793
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,400

794
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,400

01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,525
[gunshot]

796
01:19:02,525 --> 01:19:03,441

797
01:19:03,441 --> 01:19:04,441
[screams]

798
01:19:04,816 --> 01:19:05,025
Hey!

799
01:19:06,108 --> 01:19:06,400
How's your lube?

800
01:19:10,066 --> 01:19:10,358
It's him.

801
01:19:10,775 --> 01:19:10,983
What?

802
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:13,233
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

803
01:19:14,691 --> 01:19:18,441

[screams]

810
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:32,358
He's there.

811
01:19:34,983 --> 01:19:36,691
[gunshots]

812
01:19:36,691 --> 01:19:38,316

814
01:19:40,066 --> 01:19:40,691
Where's the matrix?

815
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:43,691
[screams]

816
01:19:43,691 --> 01:19:44,608

[screams]

818
01:19:46,191 --> 01:19:46,858
Where is he?

819
01:19:48,233 --> 01:19:52,400
Drop me, and you'll
never find your brother, Craven.

820
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,775
[crying]

821
01:19:56,775 --> 01:20:04,733

[screams]

824
01:20:15,025 --> 01:20:19,691
How do you know my name?

825
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:21,400
Who set me up?

826
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,983
Who took my brother?

827
01:20:24,816 --> 01:20:25,191
Vereino.

828
01:20:26,233 --> 01:20:27,691
He's killed us both now.

829
01:20:28,691 --> 01:20:30,900
[gunshots]

830
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:32,066
[gunshots]

831
01:20:32,066 --> 01:20:32,275
Run!

832
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:35,733
[gunshots]

833
01:20:35,733 --> 01:20:36,650

[gunshots] [gunshots]

837
01:21:00,858 --> 01:21:03,191
This is crushed rosary piece.

838
01:21:05,316 --> 01:21:06,900
The man who did this knows his toxins.

839
01:21:09,983 --> 01:21:10,191
One.

840
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:13,066
Two.

841
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:16,025
Three.

842
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:20,191
[gunshot]

843
01:21:20,191 --> 01:21:20,775
What are you doing?

844
01:21:25,733 --> 01:21:26,150
Pecena.

845
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,400
It's enough, Raja.

846
01:21:36,566 --> 01:21:38,108
I'm very sorry about your finger.

847
01:21:38,733 --> 01:21:39,441
Co-eteral damage.

848
01:21:40,691 --> 01:21:41,400
Cut him free.

849
01:21:47,816 --> 01:21:48,566
We met once.

850
01:21:49,775 --> 01:21:51,400
On your father's hunting trip.

851
01:21:52,025 --> 01:21:53,775
I, uh, don't remember.

852
01:21:55,025 --> 01:21:55,650
No, you wouldn't.

853
01:21:56,233 --> 01:21:57,358
My hair was different.

854
01:21:58,566 --> 01:21:59,400
You were very young.

855
01:22:00,358 --> 01:22:00,608
Me?

856
01:22:03,608 --> 01:22:04,441
I never forgot.

857
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:09,275
So have you spoken to my father?

858
01:22:10,483 --> 01:22:12,566
Has he agreed to pay?

859
01:22:13,483 --> 01:22:13,858
No.

860
01:22:14,941 --> 01:22:17,191
Nikolai Kravinov
was never going to hand over

861
01:22:17,191 --> 01:22:19,858
20 million dollars
to get his bastard son back.

862
01:22:22,233 --> 01:22:24,525
You're an accident, Dimitri.

863
01:22:26,858 --> 01:22:28,941
You came into this world as an accident,

864
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:32,275
and you came into my
possession as an accident.

865
01:22:33,941 --> 01:22:34,483
So can I go?

866
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:36,275
There's men who took you.

867
01:22:37,025 --> 01:22:38,233
They weren't there for you.

868
01:22:39,525 --> 01:22:40,733
They were there for your brother.

869
01:22:41,733 --> 01:22:43,400
Sergei, both of you went in.

870
01:22:44,775 --> 01:22:46,400
But when my guys got up there,

871
01:22:46,608 --> 01:22:50,066
oof, he'd vanished, as he always does.

872
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:52,566
So I took you.

873
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:54,275
I got lucky.

874
01:22:54,983 --> 01:22:56,400
Why would you ever want Sergei?

875
01:22:57,775 --> 01:22:58,691
He never hurt anyone.

876
01:22:58,983 --> 01:23:00,400
I really don't know, do you?

877
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:01,608
Know what?

878
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:08,941
Wait for the end.

879
01:23:09,733 --> 01:23:10,400
That's the best part.

880
01:23:15,066 --> 01:23:15,525
Kravin?

881
01:23:24,483 --> 01:23:26,816
Apparently that's
what he calls himself now.

882
01:23:27,816 --> 01:23:29,983
You think my
brother, Sergei, is the hunter?

883
01:23:30,691 --> 01:23:32,108
The hunter is a story,

884
01:23:32,441 --> 01:23:34,608
a fable to put fear into criminals.

885
01:23:35,191 --> 01:23:37,400
Clearly you didn't
know your brother very well.

886
01:23:38,066 --> 01:23:38,900
What do you mean didn't?

887
01:23:39,608 --> 01:23:40,608
Kravin had a list.

888
01:23:41,983 --> 01:23:43,441
Once you're on it, you never come off.

889
01:23:51,775 --> 01:23:53,108
So I went to check him first.

890
01:24:01,816 --> 01:24:05,441
Let me record this.

891
01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:09,400
We've got Kravin.

892
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,733
Eh, I don't know about that.

893
01:24:26,566 --> 01:24:30,483
Hello? Eliso, it's me.

894
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:31,900
The whole thing was a trap.

895
01:24:32,108 --> 01:24:32,566
The Rhino?

896
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:33,983
He knows who I am.

897
01:24:33,983 --> 01:24:34,983
He'll be after you next.

898
01:24:35,441 --> 01:24:36,275
Sergei, what are you...

899
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:37,358
Shit.

900
01:24:37,941 --> 01:24:39,400
There are five guys
walking into my building right now

901
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,525
who do not look like they belong here.

902
01:24:42,358 --> 01:24:43,650
You need to get out of there now.

903
01:24:43,983 --> 01:24:46,150
Get to the cargo terminal and stance it.

904
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:47,400
I'll have someone meet you there.

905
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,775
[dramatic music]

906
01:25:15,066 --> 01:25:16,816
I call this my feed bag.

907
01:25:19,191 --> 01:25:23,066
It's a mixture of
medications to manage my condition.

908
01:25:24,316 --> 01:25:25,108
What happened to you?

909
01:25:25,566 --> 01:25:27,316
I was underestimated, too.

910
01:25:28,441 --> 01:25:29,650
In and out of hospitals,

911
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:31,566
they never quite knew what was wrong.

912
01:25:32,525 --> 01:25:35,608
I knew I would never
have your father's respect

913
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,400
or anyone else's.

914
01:25:40,066 --> 01:25:41,441
Until I was strong.

915
01:25:42,566 --> 01:25:43,941
I tried everything.

916
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:45,691
And then...

917
01:25:46,858 --> 01:25:47,858
[dog barking]

918
01:25:47,858 --> 01:25:51,608
I found someone in New York,

919
01:25:53,358 --> 01:25:54,400
a biochemist,

920
01:25:55,108 --> 01:25:57,025
and Professor Miles Warren.

921
01:25:57,983 --> 01:26:04,150
He was developing a
procedure to increase strength tenfold.

922
01:26:07,191 --> 01:26:08,483
I signed up on the spot.

923
01:26:15,108 --> 01:26:17,733
My skin, it started to harden.

924
01:26:18,441 --> 01:26:21,858
I was indestructible,

925
01:26:21,858 --> 01:26:24,566
like a rhino.

926
01:26:26,566 --> 01:26:27,983
But the pain...

927
01:26:31,650 --> 01:26:32,400
It was too much.

928
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:37,150
[gunshot]

929
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:51,775
[sighs]

930
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,941
I think there is an
animal in each one of us, Dimitri.

931
01:26:58,691 --> 01:27:00,400
I'm taking over your father's territory.

932
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,608
I want you to be my partner.

933
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,941
The Kravinoff name
still opens a lot of doors,

934
01:27:07,191 --> 01:27:09,525
and you'll finally get
the consideration you deserve.

935
01:27:12,025 --> 01:27:12,400
You're right.

936
01:27:15,025 --> 01:27:19,400
I have been underestimated my whole life.

937
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:27,650
But if you think
I'm gonna betray my family,

938
01:27:29,733 --> 01:27:32,150
you're wrong.

939
01:27:39,650 --> 01:27:39,775
Boss.

940
01:27:41,441 --> 01:27:42,275
The boys haven't checked in.

941
01:27:42,816 --> 01:27:44,566
I can't reach them.

942
01:27:50,150 --> 01:27:50,941
Kravin is alive.

943
01:27:52,191 --> 01:27:52,733
Hey, Bart!

944
01:27:55,483 --> 01:27:56,400
I'm off with him, probably.

945
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:59,400
He's here.

946
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:30,191
[thunder]

947
01:28:30,191 --> 01:28:36,566
[growl]

948
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,858
Cute.

949
01:28:47,275 --> 01:28:50,900
Will your trick still work when
I remove your eyeballs from your head?

950
01:28:52,316 --> 01:28:52,566
Relax.

951
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:01,608
[engine revs]

952
01:29:06,566 --> 01:29:08,441
Sorry I got you wrapped up in all this.

953
01:29:08,691 --> 01:29:09,816
Any word on Dimitri?

954
01:29:10,483 --> 01:29:11,025
Not yet.

955
01:29:11,483 --> 01:29:14,983
Three of my sources have gone
offline while tracking the rhino's plane.

956
01:29:16,108 --> 01:29:18,316
I don't like the feel of this at all.

957
01:29:20,650 --> 01:29:22,066
So, what is this place?

958
01:29:22,816 --> 01:29:24,608
My mother's family
used to own this property.

959
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:29,066
Well, it's really the
only thing I have left from her.

960
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:35,608
What is happening right now?

961
01:29:36,525 --> 01:29:37,441
We're being hunted.

962
01:29:39,108 --> 01:29:39,608
By who?

963
01:29:42,316 --> 01:29:43,900
[grunting]

964
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:59,025
[growling]

965
01:29:59,025 --> 01:30:04,608
You don't hunt me!

966
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,316
Yeah, get this.

967
01:30:06,983 --> 01:30:08,566
What are you gonna do? Come on, show me.

968
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,858
I've seen her around
since she was a cub, but...

969
01:30:21,441 --> 01:30:22,858
it's a lot bigger than I remember.

970
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:26,108
You're a goddamn lunatic, I swear.

971
01:30:26,608 --> 01:30:27,941
Oh, you just figured that out now.

972
01:30:29,941 --> 01:30:31,858
I know I hired you for the job.

973
01:30:33,650 --> 01:30:36,358
But who is craving
to you? Why the obsession?

974
01:30:37,483 --> 01:30:40,191
My mentor was one of the
greatest assassins who ever lived.

975
01:30:40,691 --> 01:30:42,025
He taught me everything I know.

976
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:43,816
He was like a brother to me.

977
01:30:44,983 --> 01:30:45,650
Maybe you knew him?

978
01:30:47,316 --> 01:30:48,400
Hmm, I'll see him.

979
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:52,150
He was murdered.

980
01:30:53,191 --> 01:30:55,733
One man made it
inside and cut his throat.

981
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:57,108
Craven?

982
01:30:59,775 --> 01:31:03,483
So I traveled the world,
followed him wherever he went.

983
01:31:04,650 --> 01:31:06,483
But Craven is nature's perfect predator.

984
01:31:08,233 --> 01:31:09,400
He has no known weaknesses.

985
01:31:13,608 --> 01:31:14,358
But you found one.

986
01:31:15,483 --> 01:31:17,400
And I know how to exploit it.

987
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:20,483
I'm going to the part
where I start to give a shit.

988
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:26,316
These are Eastern Siberian rosary peas.

989
01:31:27,316 --> 01:31:28,108
A rare species.

990
01:31:29,316 --> 01:31:31,483
I found their residue
on a poison in the monastery.

991
01:31:32,816 --> 01:31:35,858
These peas are only native
to a specific region in Siberia.

992
01:31:38,566 --> 01:31:39,400
That's where we'll find them.

993
01:31:58,275 --> 01:32:12,108
Oh, careful with that.)

994
01:32:14,358 --> 01:32:15,983
Actually, I'm pretty
good with one of these things.

995
01:32:17,150 --> 01:32:19,691
Archery at summer camp.

996
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,066
Figuert,

997
01:32:25,025 --> 01:32:27,108
Woodaven's

998
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:28,066
Tribulus.

999
01:32:29,191 --> 01:32:29,900
Mm-hmm.

1000
01:32:31,483 --> 01:32:32,066
Rosary peas?

1001
01:32:33,108 --> 01:32:34,400
You seem to know your stuff.

1002
01:32:36,108 --> 01:32:36,650
They'll kill you.

1003
01:32:37,275 --> 01:32:38,066
Or save you.

1004
01:32:39,025 --> 01:32:40,108
Nature's funny like that.

1005
01:32:41,983 --> 01:32:42,941
What are you trying to do here?

1006
01:32:47,150 --> 01:32:48,066
Tell me about this.

1007
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:51,316
It was my grandmother's.

1008
01:32:52,691 --> 01:32:54,608
We were on safari visiting her that day.

1009
01:32:55,066 --> 01:32:58,066
I've been trying to figure
out what was in here for years.

1010
01:32:59,775 --> 01:33:01,566
My grandmother was kind of a...

1011
01:33:03,066 --> 01:33:03,275
Mystic.

1012
01:33:04,608 --> 01:33:05,816
She had a lot of crazy stuff around.

1013
01:33:07,775 --> 01:33:11,691
My parents didn't like to talk
about it, but she was a very powerful woman.

1014
01:33:13,733 --> 01:33:15,900
She said it would
heal whoever drank it in...

1015
01:33:17,525 --> 01:33:18,691
Undreamed of ways.

1016
01:33:19,983 --> 01:33:21,566
I was... I was just a kid.

1017
01:33:22,066 --> 01:33:24,150
I didn't know what it would actually do.

1018
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:25,691
This saved my life.

1019
01:33:26,775 --> 01:33:27,191
Did it?

1020
01:33:27,733 --> 01:33:29,066
Trust me. Change me.

1021
01:33:29,441 --> 01:33:29,816
Exactly.

1022
01:33:31,566 --> 01:33:32,525
Look at what you became.

1023
01:33:36,941 --> 01:33:39,400
I need to know what was in here.

1024
01:33:42,733 --> 01:33:43,608
And if you can get any more.

1025
01:33:44,816 --> 01:33:45,108
No.

1026
01:33:48,233 --> 01:33:50,691
She died not long after
that trip, and I never saw her again.

1027
01:33:59,150 --> 01:34:00,441
I heard back from one of my sources.

1028
01:34:01,108 --> 01:34:03,983
The rhino's on the move.
We should know more very soon.

1029
01:34:04,608 --> 01:34:05,816
I knew you'd be good at this.

1030
01:34:09,358 --> 01:34:12,233
Sergei, we're gonna get Dimitri back.

1031
01:34:13,691 --> 01:34:15,525
But is all of this really worth it?

1032
01:34:16,441 --> 01:34:19,066
Clipso, I was made to do this.

1033
01:34:20,691 --> 01:34:22,858
I'm the greatest hunter
on this planet, it's undeniable.

1034
01:34:24,275 --> 01:34:26,816
There's nobody I can't
track down, nobody I can't beat.

1035
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:28,608
There's nobody can even touch me, so no.

1036
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:31,066
Why would I want to stop?

1037
01:34:31,066 --> 01:34:33,400
It's called karma. She catches up to you.

1038
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:38,525
Not me. I'm faster than she is.

1039
01:34:42,108 --> 01:34:43,900
But Dimitri wasn't.

1040
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,400
Interesting piece.

1041
01:34:56,275 --> 01:34:57,941
It's gonna take more
than a gun to kill Kraven.

1042
01:34:58,733 --> 01:35:02,108
I find this formula that was
developed by MI6 to be particularly effective.

1043
01:35:03,858 --> 01:35:05,191
May I?

1044
01:35:10,316 --> 01:35:14,691
It first brings on your darkest
nightmares, then paralysis of your vital organs,

1045
01:35:15,191 --> 01:35:16,650
before a most violent death.

1046
01:35:18,441 --> 01:35:20,400
I like your style.

1047
01:35:28,483 --> 01:35:33,441
Only one person has this number.

1048
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:36,566
Dima, where are you?

1049
01:35:36,983 --> 01:35:39,691
Sergei, I'm sorry,
they made me call you...

1050
01:35:40,066 --> 01:35:40,400
Dimitri.

1051
01:35:41,358 --> 01:35:44,191
I'm afraid not. But
now you know he is alive.

1052
01:35:44,441 --> 01:35:45,066
What do you want?

1053
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:48,400
A life without looking over my shoulder.

1054
01:35:50,066 --> 01:35:54,275
You have two choices. I know
you hate your father as much as I do.

1055
01:35:54,775 --> 01:36:01,316
So, you and I, and young
Dimitri here, we work together.

1056
01:36:01,733 --> 01:36:02,900
You could be my partners.

1057
01:36:03,441 --> 01:36:05,233
Or I kill you and burn...

1058
01:36:11,691 --> 01:36:14,400
Okay then. Now we go hunt the hunter.

1059
01:36:26,816 --> 01:36:32,900
Spread out.

1060
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:35,691
Bring me his body.

1061
01:36:37,566 --> 01:36:38,316
Well, don't come back.

1062
01:36:59,233 --> 01:36:59,400
Roger.

1063
01:37:00,316 --> 01:37:05,608
Where is he?

1064
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:07,400
He's already here.

1065
01:38:05,483 --> 01:38:11,233
Translator,

1066
01:38:11,233 --> 01:38:15,108
(screaming)

1067
01:38:19,233 --> 01:38:22,358
Amateurs, so embarrassing for us.

1068
01:38:23,358 --> 01:38:23,816
Do it.

1069
01:38:26,775 --> 01:38:27,441
Start the run.

1070
01:38:31,316 --> 01:38:33,900
(grunting)

1071
01:38:38,316 --> 01:38:39,358
Fire in the hole.

1072
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:41,483
Gotta be kidding.

1073
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:53,525
(exploding)

1074
01:38:53,525 --> 01:38:55,983
(panting)

1075
01:39:10,150 --> 01:39:16,900
(grunting)

1076
01:39:47,275 --> 01:39:48,983
Their
hallucinations are just the beginning.

1077
01:39:51,608 --> 01:39:52,900
Are you seeing your worst nightmare?

1078
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:56,566
One.

1079
01:39:59,233 --> 01:39:59,400
Two.

1080
01:40:02,566 --> 01:40:02,733
Three.

1081
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:07,525
(panting)

1082
01:40:09,233 --> 01:40:12,400
As the poison makes
its way to your spinal cord,

1083
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,816
you'll begin to lose all motor functions.

1084
01:40:15,608 --> 01:40:16,400
Then it's fixation.

1085
01:40:17,691 --> 01:40:18,400
So you're the legend.

1086
01:40:21,233 --> 01:40:21,691
The myth.

1087
01:40:25,483 --> 01:40:27,816
Well look at you now, you're just a myth.

1088
01:40:33,441 --> 01:40:43,150
(grunting)

1089
01:40:44,525 --> 01:40:44,816
Fire.

1090
01:40:48,650 --> 01:40:51,233
(grunting)

1091
01:41:03,441 --> 01:41:04,816
(grunting)

1092
01:41:04,858 --> 01:41:06,191
You give them help, Craven.

1093
01:41:07,275 --> 01:41:09,525
(grunting)

1094
01:41:20,816 --> 01:41:23,441
Honestly, I thought that would be harder.

1095
01:41:28,025 --> 01:41:30,900
It's done, but the
brother's still out there.

1096
01:41:31,566 --> 01:41:32,191
Go find him.

1097
01:41:33,358 --> 01:41:33,900
Let's go.

1098
01:41:36,816 --> 01:41:36,983
One.

1099
01:41:39,150 --> 01:41:39,316
Two.

1100
01:41:40,441 --> 01:41:40,941
(gun firing)

1101
01:41:43,191 --> 01:41:43,941
Three, motherfucker.

1102
01:41:45,025 --> 01:41:46,483
Goodbye, Craven the Hunser.

1103
01:41:52,275 --> 01:41:52,441
Sergei.

1104
01:41:58,066 --> 01:41:59,358
Can't catch a break, can you, mate?

1105
01:42:03,650 --> 01:42:10,191
(gasping)

1106
01:42:24,858 --> 01:42:26,775
Legends, don't die.

1107
01:42:27,316 --> 01:42:29,150
Now get the fuck up, Craven.

1108
01:42:29,441 --> 01:42:35,191
(dramatic music)

1109
01:42:35,191 --> 01:42:39,108
(gasping)

1110
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:47,441
I knew you had more of that.

1111
01:42:48,025 --> 01:42:50,400
Well forgive me
for not trusting a lunatic

1112
01:42:51,316 --> 01:42:52,900
with my family's deepest legacy.

1113
01:42:55,150 --> 01:42:55,483
Get up.

1114
01:42:57,233 --> 01:42:57,525
Okay.

1115
01:42:59,441 --> 01:43:00,650
(sighing)

1116
01:43:01,775 --> 01:43:03,400
Well that must be some summer, Kent.

1117
01:43:04,233 --> 01:43:05,650
You're not the only one with secrets.

1118
01:43:07,150 --> 01:43:08,400
Don't make me regret this.

1119
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:14,400
(dramatic music)

1120
01:43:19,316 --> 01:43:19,816
It's over.

1121
01:43:21,816 --> 01:43:22,316
Craven's dead.

1122
01:43:22,525 --> 01:43:28,316
(laughing)

1123
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:29,983
What a day.

1124
01:43:32,733 --> 01:43:33,650
(laughing)

1125
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:38,275
Put him in the car.

1126
01:43:40,108 --> 01:43:42,150
Who knows, maybe Nikolai will pay now

1127
01:43:42,150 --> 01:43:43,650
that he has only one son left.

1128
01:43:44,775 --> 01:43:47,358
(dramatic music)

1129
01:43:52,525 --> 01:43:59,441
(dramatic music)

1130
01:44:03,525 --> 01:44:07,900
Does anyone else
see what I'm seeing here?

1131
01:44:11,191 --> 01:44:15,400
(engine revving)

1132
01:44:22,525 --> 01:44:34,108
(dramatic music)

1133
01:44:34,108 --> 01:44:39,900
(crashing)

1134
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:44,941
(screaming)

1135
01:44:52,525 --> 01:45:07,608
(dramatic music)

1136
01:45:08,566 --> 01:45:09,400
Craven!

1137
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:15,275
(dramatic music)

1138
01:45:21,983 --> 01:45:22,733
Gosh, you're really heavy.

1139
01:45:25,566 --> 01:45:50,275
(screaming) (dramatic music)

1140
01:45:50,275 --> 01:45:51,900
(screaming)

1141
01:45:54,066 --> 01:46:12,400
Suggie. (dramatic music)

1142
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:16,108
(crashing)

1143
01:46:16,108 --> 01:46:23,483
(grunting)

1144
01:46:23,483 --> 01:46:26,525
(grunting)

1145
01:46:26,525 --> 01:46:28,441
(groaning)

1146
01:46:28,441 --> 01:46:32,358
(dramatic music)

1147
01:46:32,358 --> 01:46:33,983
(grunting)

1148
01:46:39,858 --> 01:46:53,275
(dramatic music)

1149
01:46:53,275 --> 01:46:55,733
(groaning)

1150
01:46:55,733 --> 01:46:57,066
(crashing)

1151
01:46:57,066 --> 01:46:58,525
(dramatic music)

1152
01:46:58,525 --> 01:47:12,400
(groaning) My father
was right about one thing.

1153
01:47:14,150 --> 01:47:14,983
You are nothing.

1154
01:47:19,191 --> 01:47:22,108
(dramatic music)

1155
01:47:22,108 --> 01:47:25,191
(crashing)

1156
01:47:25,191 --> 01:47:27,858
(groaning)

1157
01:47:27,858 --> 01:47:32,566
(groaning)

1158
01:47:32,566 --> 01:47:37,441
(dramatic music)

1159
01:47:39,441 --> 01:47:42,941
(groaning)

1160
01:47:42,941 --> 01:47:51,608
(crashing)

1161
01:47:51,608 --> 01:47:54,483
(groaning)

1162
01:47:54,483 --> 01:47:54,983
(groaning)

1163
01:47:54,983 --> 01:47:57,358
(crashing)

1164
01:47:57,358 --> 01:47:58,650
(groaning)

1165
01:47:58,650 --> 01:47:59,400
(crashing)

1166
01:48:04,025 --> 01:48:06,816
(crashing)

1167
01:48:06,816 --> 01:48:12,441
(groaning)

1168
01:48:12,441 --> 01:48:19,025
(coughing)

1169
01:48:19,316 --> 01:48:20,941
It's no video of me, how did you get it?

1170
01:48:22,900 --> 01:48:23,525
(coughing)

1171
01:48:24,733 --> 01:48:25,191
Who sent it?

1172
01:48:26,525 --> 01:48:27,275
(groaning)

1173
01:48:27,441 --> 01:48:30,983
How is it that even the great hunter

1174
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:36,275
can't see what was
always right in front of him?

1175
01:48:37,650 --> 01:48:41,316
(coughing)

1176
01:48:41,316 --> 01:48:43,608
(crunching)

1177
01:48:48,525 --> 01:48:48,733
No.

1178
01:48:51,316 --> 01:48:53,108
He deserves to die.

1179
01:48:53,733 --> 01:48:54,150
He will.

1180
01:48:55,441 --> 01:48:56,900
But Demetria is not you.

1181
01:49:01,900 --> 01:49:10,900
(dramatic music)

1182
01:49:11,775 --> 01:49:12,150
I wish,

1183
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:19,358
I wish I never met you, Kravinovs.

1184
01:49:20,691 --> 01:49:22,858
(groaning)

1185
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:34,066
(dramatic music)

1186
01:49:34,066 --> 01:49:41,775
(door opening)

1187
01:49:44,858 --> 01:49:45,066
Whoa.

1188
01:49:47,608 --> 01:49:49,650
(growling)

1189
01:49:51,775 --> 01:49:58,066
(growling)

1190
01:50:00,108 --> 01:50:02,900
Tharga, how did you find me?

1191
01:50:04,358 --> 01:50:04,983
I'm a hunter.

1192
01:50:07,358 --> 01:50:09,483
It's what we do.

1193
01:50:13,525 --> 01:50:18,441
You sent the video
and told the rhino who I was.

1194
01:50:20,816 --> 01:50:24,108
Did you really think
Father would not recognize

1195
01:50:24,108 --> 01:50:25,608
actions of his own son?

1196
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:29,316
An assassin who uses all the methods

1197
01:50:29,316 --> 01:50:31,275
of animals of the jungle?

1198
01:50:34,108 --> 01:50:37,358
You of all people
should recognize and appreciate

1199
01:50:37,358 --> 01:50:39,441
the beauty of the trap I set.

1200
01:50:41,941 --> 01:50:45,733
The rhino has come for you.

1201
01:50:47,566 --> 01:50:48,316
He went strong enough
that he could not be found.

1202
01:50:48,483 --> 01:50:50,066
You had to fight
him off by yourself, huh?

1203
01:50:50,566 --> 01:50:50,900
Exactly.

1204
01:50:52,691 --> 01:50:57,025
But my son, my real son, Kravin,

1205
01:50:59,108 --> 01:51:00,150
no one is stronger.

1206
01:51:02,316 --> 01:51:06,775
And I knew you
would not go after him for me.

1207
01:51:09,358 --> 01:51:10,733
So I sent him after you.

1208
01:51:12,983 --> 01:51:13,566
Some trap.

1209
01:51:13,941 --> 01:51:17,150
(sighing)

1210
01:51:17,566 --> 01:51:18,941
I mean, Dimitri could have died,

1211
01:51:18,941 --> 01:51:20,483
but that's the price
of doing business, right?

1212
01:51:20,733 --> 01:51:22,316
No, no, no, no, no.

1213
01:51:22,483 --> 01:51:26,525
Because I know you
would not let anything happen

1214
01:51:26,733 --> 01:51:28,108
to our precious Dimitri.

1215
01:51:30,233 --> 01:51:32,150
Our empire is secure.

1216
01:51:32,650 --> 01:51:33,316
So what now?

1217
01:51:34,358 --> 01:51:38,733
Papa, we forget about the past.

1218
01:51:40,108 --> 01:51:42,025
Imagine a future together.

1219
01:51:44,191 --> 01:51:45,650
His family.

1220
01:52:00,650 --> 01:52:02,650
Sergei, where are you going?

1221
01:52:09,525 --> 01:52:13,275
I could have come for you years ago.

1222
01:52:15,316 --> 01:52:16,108
But I didn't.

1223
01:52:18,316 --> 01:52:19,483
After everything you'd done,

1224
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,191
all the pain you put in the world,

1225
01:52:25,775 --> 01:52:26,525
you were my father.

1226
01:52:29,066 --> 01:52:29,775
I still am.

1227
01:52:32,108 --> 01:52:32,400
Sit.

1228
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:46,441
(somber music)

1229
01:52:46,775 --> 01:52:47,691
Never fear death.

1230
01:52:50,275 --> 01:52:51,191
Isn't that what you taught me?

1231
01:52:55,775 --> 01:52:58,900
(ominous music)

1232
01:52:58,900 --> 01:53:09,483
(phone ringing)

1233
01:53:13,941 --> 01:53:15,358
(growling)

1234
01:53:15,358 --> 01:53:25,150
(somber music)

1235
01:53:35,441 --> 01:53:36,858
I feel unhappy

1236
01:53:39,733 --> 01:53:41,441
I feel so sad

1237
01:53:44,066 --> 01:53:46,358
I've lost the best friend

1238
01:53:48,525 --> 01:53:50,816
That I'll ever had

1239
01:53:55,566 --> 01:54:00,650
I'm going to change it

1240
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:09,941
Happy birthday, Dima.

1241
01:54:11,150 --> 01:54:12,066
It is a happy birthday.

1242
01:54:14,441 --> 01:54:15,400
First one in a long time.

1243
01:54:16,691 --> 01:54:18,025
And that's thanks to you, Sergei.

1244
01:54:18,983 --> 01:54:20,066
Oh, come on.

1245
01:54:20,066 --> 01:54:21,275
Or Craven, should I say.

1246
01:54:21,816 --> 01:54:22,691
What do I call you now?

1247
01:54:23,441 --> 01:54:24,191
Mr. Craven?

1248
01:54:24,233 --> 01:54:24,983
You know who I am.

1249
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:25,900
I know you.

1250
01:54:29,941 --> 01:54:33,775
That was hell, what I went through.

1251
01:54:34,525 --> 01:54:36,525
But it also freed me.

1252
01:54:37,900 --> 01:54:41,608
I feel almost born again.

1253
01:54:43,941 --> 01:54:46,275
I found a doctor in New York.

1254
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:49,025
A little unorthodox, I must admit.

1255
01:54:50,483 --> 01:54:53,525
But he really helped me.

1256
01:54:53,983 --> 01:54:57,650
I mean, changed me.

1257
01:54:58,983 --> 01:54:59,400
How so?

1258
01:54:59,941 --> 01:55:00,566
Hang on a sec.

1259
01:55:03,691 --> 01:55:05,941
(speaking in foreign language)

1260
01:55:10,025 --> 01:55:12,150
Since when did you
have friends in the brotha, huh?

1261
01:55:12,483 --> 01:55:13,816
Well, I have business, lots of people.

1262
01:55:14,150 --> 01:55:14,441
Business?

1263
01:55:15,275 --> 01:55:17,025
I thought you said you
were gonna sell Papa's assets

1264
01:55:17,025 --> 01:55:18,025
and get out of the business.

1265
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:19,316
I changed my mind.

1266
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:21,358
Dima, I didn't pull your ass out to fire,

1267
01:55:21,358 --> 01:55:22,525
so you can become a man like our father.

1268
01:55:22,983 --> 01:55:23,525
Are you serious?

1269
01:55:24,191 --> 01:55:26,400
You put my ass in that fire.

1270
01:55:27,066 --> 01:55:28,650
You're a man just like our father.

1271
01:55:28,650 --> 01:55:29,858
No, I'm nothing like him.

1272
01:55:30,608 --> 01:55:31,400
I have a code.

1273
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:32,400
And you're different than him.

1274
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:33,400
I'm better than him.

1275
01:55:33,483 --> 01:55:35,441
You're not better than him.

1276
01:55:36,025 --> 01:55:36,691
You're worse.

1277
01:55:38,566 --> 01:55:40,025
How did Papa die again?

1278
01:55:42,441 --> 01:55:43,483
A hunting accident.

1279
01:55:44,691 --> 01:55:45,150
Was it?

1280
01:55:46,108 --> 01:55:46,900
Don't lie to me.

1281
01:55:48,691 --> 01:55:50,941
You think you have
some kind of honor, huh?

1282
01:55:51,858 --> 01:55:52,650
Some kind of code.

1283
01:55:53,983 --> 01:55:54,316
Bullshit.

1284
01:55:56,150 --> 01:56:01,108
You're just another
man hunting for a trophy.

1285
01:56:01,150 --> 01:56:09,275
(dramatic music)

1286
01:56:11,233 --> 01:56:11,400
Hey.

1287
01:56:15,358 --> 01:56:15,691
Dimitri.

1288
01:56:24,566 --> 01:56:26,191
You should see the look on your face.

1289
01:56:31,150 --> 01:56:33,900
(dramatic music)

1290
01:56:36,150 --> 01:56:36,316
Hey.

1291
01:56:41,150 --> 01:56:41,441
Dimitri.

1292
01:56:43,108 --> 01:56:43,775
You know me.

1293
01:56:44,941 --> 01:56:46,275
I've always been a chameleon.

1294
01:56:48,316 --> 01:56:50,233
It's the one thing I was ever good at.

1295
01:56:51,275 --> 01:56:52,108
Who is this doctor?

1296
01:56:53,566 --> 01:56:54,275
What did he do to you?

1297
01:56:54,316 --> 01:56:55,525
You want me to be weak,

1298
01:56:56,441 --> 01:56:58,816
so then you can be
strong, but I'm strong now.

1299
01:56:59,858 --> 01:57:02,108
I can be whoever I want to be.

1300
01:57:02,608 --> 01:57:04,858
The rhino is gone, dad is gone.

1301
01:57:05,275 --> 01:57:06,316
It's all just there.

1302
01:57:07,650 --> 01:57:08,400
For the taking.

1303
01:57:10,816 --> 01:57:11,983
I'm gonna take it.

1304
01:57:16,275 --> 01:57:18,566
You know I can't let you do that.

1305
01:57:23,233 --> 01:57:24,025
Go home, Craven.

1306
01:57:30,066 --> 01:57:31,108
Dad left you something.

1307
01:57:42,691 --> 01:58:05,275
(singing in foreign language)
(dramatic music)

1308
01:58:06,108 --> 01:58:09,733
Sergei, each of us has path to walk.

1309
01:58:11,483 --> 01:58:13,191
Embrace who you really are,

1310
01:58:14,108 --> 01:58:15,941
and you will have
the strength to walk it.

1311
01:58:17,650 --> 01:58:19,066
You are more than my child.

1312
01:58:21,608 --> 01:58:22,150
You are me.

1313
01:58:24,733 --> 01:58:25,733
And I am you.

1314
01:58:28,858 --> 01:58:31,900
(singing in foreign language)

1315
01:58:32,233 --> 01:58:32,941
We are hunters.

1316
01:58:36,025 --> 01:58:38,025
The greatest the world has ever known.

1317
01:58:40,066 --> 01:58:43,691
