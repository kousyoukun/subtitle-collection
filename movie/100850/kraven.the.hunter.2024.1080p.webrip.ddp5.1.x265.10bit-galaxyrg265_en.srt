1
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:27,665
You were late.

2
00:08:29,206 --> 00:08:31,624
Next time you break out
of prison and I fly this thing.

3
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:32,875
No, thanks.

4
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,834
So how'd it go?

5
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:36,959
How it always goes.

6
00:08:38,294 --> 00:08:41,753
Good for me, bad for him.

7
00:09:46,572 --> 00:09:56,659
Kravanov and Kravanov, your
father is coming to pick you up.

8
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,287
What'd you do?

9
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:06,080
Me.

10
00:10:07,496 --> 00:10:08,331
Nothing, I thought it was you.

11
00:10:08,747 --> 00:10:08,997
No.

12
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:33,632
Where are we going, Papa?

13
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,383
We're in the middle of a term at school.

14
00:10:36,842 --> 00:10:37,051
Sergei.

15
00:10:37,176 --> 00:10:38,843
Mom never made us do shit like this.

16
00:10:39,218 --> 00:10:43,678
Sergei, your mother is dead.

17
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,637
She took all life.

18
00:10:46,888 --> 00:10:50,889
She was weak, sick in her mind.

19
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:56,851
Was her choice.

20
00:10:58,977 --> 00:11:00,518
Well, she died because you sent her away.

21
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:01,227
No.

22
00:11:02,353 --> 00:11:04,395
She gave up long ago.

23
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,146
You haven't even seen her for two years.

24
00:11:09,814 --> 00:11:13,190
Nothing will change
for you, or for you, Dmitry.

25
00:11:13,983 --> 00:11:15,899
Where are we going, Papa? To the funeral?

26
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,651
If you take on life, you
do not get the honor of funeral.

27
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:21,694
So then where are you taking us?

28
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:22,819
We go to hunt.

29
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:25,863
There'll be no sightings of lions.

30
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:29,905
It will be good for you.

31
00:11:30,364 --> 00:11:30,614
Both.

32
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:36,783
The joined men, be one
with nature, should to kill.

33
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:39,243
Fan.

34
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:58,667
Careful with those.

35
00:12:00,043 --> 00:12:01,960
Put the cards away now, Calypso.

36
00:12:02,503 --> 00:12:04,294
Your mom and dad will be back soon.

37
00:12:04,962 --> 00:12:07,045
And you know the way
they feel about all this.

38
00:12:07,921 --> 00:12:09,088
It's just a game, Grammy.

39
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:12,298
You think my cards
are just pretty pictures?

40
00:12:14,173 --> 00:12:14,924
Think again, Calypso.

41
00:12:16,924 --> 00:12:19,509
They show us the unseen road.

42
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:23,677
What? Like predict the future?

43
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:26,512
Mm-hmm. In the right hands.

44
00:12:32,056 --> 00:12:33,681
Lay three cards down.

45
00:12:35,307 --> 00:12:37,350
The first card is the subject.

46
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:39,434
The high priestess?

47
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:43,935
You do come from a long
line of very powerful women.

48
00:12:44,936 --> 00:12:46,979
The second card is the situation.

49
00:12:48,854 --> 00:12:49,397
The tower.

50
00:12:50,522 --> 00:12:52,731
There's going to be a terrible accident.

51
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,858
The third card is the outcome.

52
00:12:59,109 --> 00:12:59,317
Strength.

53
00:13:00,776 --> 00:13:02,902
There is great danger in that card.

54
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:05,944
I have something for you, Calypso.

55
00:13:06,654 --> 00:13:08,780
I was going to wait until you were older.

56
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:11,947
But the cards have shown
us you will need it very soon.

57
00:13:11,947 --> 00:13:13,657
What is it?

58
00:13:14,615 --> 00:13:15,157
A potion.

59
00:13:16,074 --> 00:13:20,034
The formula has been passed
down in our family for generations.

60
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:23,577
What does that symbol mean?

61
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:27,037
It's a sign of the spirit, papa ligpa.

62
00:13:28,038 --> 00:13:30,413
He opens the gate to the other side.

63
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,289
Protect it.

64
00:13:33,498 --> 00:13:34,790
Very powerful.

65
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:37,707
Go ahead.

66
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:42,752
It will heal whoever
drinks it in undreamed-of ways.

67
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:45,711
The time is coming soon.

68
00:13:46,836 --> 00:13:48,671
You'll know what to do with it.

69
00:13:49,921 --> 00:13:51,963
Now put those away
before your parents get back.

70
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,971
Well done, Nikolai.

71
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,018
Sergei.

72
00:14:28,978 --> 00:14:32,355
You see, it's so beautiful.

73
00:14:36,106 --> 00:14:36,982
Never fear death.

74
00:14:38,774 --> 00:14:39,442
They are prey.

75
00:14:40,817 --> 00:14:41,984
We are predators.

76
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:53,698
Men should be only
animal that is dreaded.

77
00:14:59,575 --> 00:15:00,283
The matry.

78
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:02,284
Don't look so weak.

79
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:04,993
Be a man.

80
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:10,537
You all right?

81
00:15:11,788 --> 00:15:12,163
Yeah.

82
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,832
You shouldn't have
talked to you like that.

83
00:15:17,498 --> 00:15:17,790
Yeah, well...

84
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:20,584
He's an asshole.

85
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,293
There's nothing I can do about that.

86
00:15:24,543 --> 00:15:26,586
He'll never respect
me like he respects you.

87
00:15:28,337 --> 00:15:28,753
Wanna bet?

88
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:39,466
I miss Ma.

89
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:42,258
Me too, Dima.

90
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:43,968
Me too.

91
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:51,846
Is it the Zarr?

92
00:15:52,305 --> 00:15:53,555
Not even Pussycat.

93
00:15:54,097 --> 00:15:56,348
Perhaps it's the
Zarr's illegitimate half-brother.

94
00:15:58,224 --> 00:15:58,890
Like your Demetri.

95
00:15:59,224 --> 00:15:59,933
Leave the boy.

96
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,184
He carries no blame
for his father's wandering.

97
00:16:05,018 --> 00:16:07,019
You will know Zarr when you're here.

98
00:16:08,603 --> 00:16:12,021
He sounds like thunder from mountaintop.

99
00:16:12,146 --> 00:16:13,813
You have seen this beast?

100
00:16:15,022 --> 00:16:16,522
I have seen his work.

101
00:16:18,148 --> 00:16:23,275
This cat has killed two
thousand, maybe three dozen men. Yes?

102
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,277
For as long as men like you
have been coming down here to kill lions,

103
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:31,988
there have been legends
of the one who can't be killed.

104
00:16:32,654 --> 00:16:33,613
Men like me.

105
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,031
But you still take
my money, don't you, Baha'i?

106
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,075
A lion hunts for food.

107
00:16:42,658 --> 00:16:43,534
Same as I do.

108
00:16:49,203 --> 00:16:50,411
Why do you hunt Nikolai?

109
00:16:51,787 --> 00:16:52,996
You know this, Baha'i.

110
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,207
Men who kill legend, becomes legend.

111
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:04,459
Nikolai.

112
00:17:05,376 --> 00:17:06,043
We should talk.

113
00:17:06,043 --> 00:17:07,502
Save your pet.

114
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:09,836
No, it's a condition.

115
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:13,880
I'll be okay, as long as I
take a few breaks here and there.

116
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:17,714
One thing that you should know about
me is that I'm always thinking of the future.

117
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,591
I want you to be my partner.

118
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,426
What is your name?

119
00:17:28,386 --> 00:17:30,553
I'm my guest here on Vladimir.

120
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:33,888
Alexey Sitzivich.

121
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:34,388
No.

122
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,556
You do not care of name.

123
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:43,350
In this world, you barely exist.

124
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:46,101
So what can some non-name, non-existent,

125
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:49,269
conditioned, suffering
fool offer up to the Kravinovs?

126
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,395
Nothing.

127
00:17:53,812 --> 00:17:54,563
I am here,

128
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,273
teaching my sons the joy of stalking.

129
00:17:59,857 --> 00:18:04,066
And you and your
imbecilic voice are stalking me.

130
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:06,902
So be quiet.

131
00:18:11,111 --> 00:18:17,947
Well, father gets him this time.

132
00:18:19,407 --> 00:18:19,782
Why?

133
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,574
Well, because then he'll become a
legend and we don't have to come here again.

134
00:18:27,076 --> 00:18:28,994
A true legend would fight fair.

135
00:18:30,161 --> 00:18:30,744
Not with a gun.

136
00:18:31,412 --> 00:18:33,704
You do it one on one with
only the tools you're born with.

137
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:43,166
(growling)

138
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:46,084
Dmitry, get back.

139
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:16,846
(growling)

140
00:19:22,098 --> 00:19:23,474
Dmitry, move!

141
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:24,850
Move!

142
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:29,601
Run!

143
00:19:37,022 --> 00:19:41,023
(screaming)

144
00:19:44,107 --> 00:19:44,817
Sergei!

145
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,025
Sergei!

146
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:48,609
Sergei!

147
00:20:06,158 --> 00:20:07,867
(screaming)

148
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:12,119
Calypso, look!

149
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:29,335
Come on, honey, stand up.

150
00:20:33,795 --> 00:20:34,128
Calypso?

151
00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:37,421
Calypso!

152
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:41,256
Calypso!

153
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:08,142
(growling)

154
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:40,489
In the name of all the
spirits and all the mysteries...

155
00:21:41,322 --> 00:21:41,489
Mysteries...

156
00:21:45,157 --> 00:21:45,574
Help!

157
00:21:51,326 --> 00:21:53,660
Bring the power of the earth.

158
00:21:54,745 --> 00:21:56,161
The power of the earth.

159
00:21:56,161 --> 00:22:03,623
(rumbling)

160
00:22:05,165 --> 00:22:06,082
Wait!

161
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,171
Bring the power of the sky.

162
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:29,884
Everybody's clear. Shocking now.

163
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,428
Okay, team, we've done all we can.

164
00:22:38,388 --> 00:22:41,180
I'm going to call Time of Death, 651.

165
00:22:56,228 --> 00:22:59,812
(growling)

166
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:17,487
The EMTs found that card in your pocket.

167
00:23:18,445 --> 00:23:20,446
You are one very lucky boy.

168
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,697
Thank you for saving me.

169
00:23:24,031 --> 00:23:25,198
I wish I could say I did.

170
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,533
But I didn't save him.

171
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:30,200
I don't understand.

172
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:32,410
That makes the two of us.

173
00:23:33,118 --> 00:23:36,870
But we're going to run some tests,
see if we can figure out what happened.

174
00:23:37,912 --> 00:23:38,120
Sergei.

175
00:23:39,621 --> 00:23:39,996
Dima.

176
00:23:47,249 --> 00:23:48,082
Why did you not shoot?

177
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:53,209
You must be Sergei's father, Mr. Kravinov.

178
00:23:53,293 --> 00:23:56,420
I am here to take him home.

179
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:58,587
He needs to stay here and recover.

180
00:23:59,754 --> 00:24:01,963
Clinically, he was dead
for more than three minutes.

181
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,798
He will be leaving with me.

182
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,220
Sergei.

183
00:24:41,654 --> 00:24:43,189
Sergei, come down here.

184
00:24:43,272 --> 00:24:52,776
Father is the only
animal that is dreaded.

185
00:24:54,234 --> 00:24:55,402
You're getting too good at that.

186
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:56,569
He'll be all right.

187
00:24:57,778 --> 00:24:59,320
You almost got your brother killed.

188
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:03,280
You almost got yourself killed.

189
00:25:03,905 --> 00:25:05,239
Because you were afraid.

190
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:08,157
Fear will eat you.

191
00:25:09,991 --> 00:25:11,241
It makes you weak.

192
00:25:11,241 --> 00:25:11,491
I am not a child of any kind.
I am not a child of any kind. Weak?

193
00:25:13,326 --> 00:25:14,577
Are you weak like your mother?

194
00:25:15,368 --> 00:25:15,577
Crazy?

195
00:25:16,577 --> 00:25:17,703
Or are you like me?

196
00:25:18,786 --> 00:25:21,746
Because if you show weakness to enemies,

197
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:24,581
it gives them an opening.

198
00:25:25,914 --> 00:25:28,457
You are old enough to understand.

199
00:25:30,124 --> 00:25:32,917
You're not my business, yes?

200
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:37,336
One day, you will be in charge.

201
00:25:38,586 --> 00:25:39,587
Dimitri, go!

202
00:25:41,296 --> 00:25:43,672
Dimitri, welcome
back to school in New York.

203
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:48,381
And you will stay here with me.

204
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:51,342
I think America is making you soft.

205
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,384
Just for your own good.

206
00:25:55,176 --> 00:25:57,052
Each of us have a path to walk.

207
00:25:59,803 --> 00:26:01,304
Embrace who you really are,

208
00:26:02,471 --> 00:26:04,222
and you will have
the strength to walk it.

209
00:26:07,431 --> 00:26:07,848
Come.

210
00:26:09,974 --> 00:26:10,265
Come here.

211
00:26:11,266 --> 00:26:16,435
I got you something.

212
00:26:23,855 --> 00:26:25,606
You never have to be afraid again.

213
00:26:28,232 --> 00:26:35,193
He should have killed you!

214
00:26:38,027 --> 00:26:42,821
What is going on with you?

215
00:26:47,156 --> 00:26:48,281
Sergei, get back here.

216
00:26:48,281 --> 00:27:36,301
Are you okay?

217
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:49,406
[gunshot]

218
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:04,162
Don't leave me with him.

219
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,608
[gasps]

220
00:28:35,242 --> 00:28:35,659
I'm going.

221
00:28:37,075 --> 00:28:37,576
I have to.

222
00:28:37,993 --> 00:28:38,160
Why?

223
00:28:38,618 --> 00:28:39,661
I can't explain it.

224
00:28:40,036 --> 00:28:41,161
Something's happened to me.

225
00:28:41,952 --> 00:28:42,828
What are you talking about?

226
00:28:43,203 --> 00:28:44,871
Do you remember
the place we used to camp?

227
00:28:46,204 --> 00:28:48,205
Where all you could hear
were the crickets and the owls.

228
00:28:49,415 --> 00:28:51,165
And Mom used to
sing to us around the fire.

229
00:28:52,124 --> 00:28:53,874
That land is all I have left of her.

230
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,292
Why does that make it okay?

231
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:57,793
Picture me there.

232
00:29:02,253 --> 00:29:02,336
I'm sorry, Dima.

233
00:29:04,629 --> 00:29:05,087
I am.

234
00:29:09,339 --> 00:29:10,464
Just go, if we're gonna go.

235
00:29:13,507 --> 00:29:14,008
Go.

236
00:29:16,551 --> 00:29:19,593
I won't be gone forever.

237
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:30,681
Where you headed?

238
00:29:32,348 --> 00:29:33,057
Trying to get out of England.

239
00:29:34,391 --> 00:29:34,641
Russia.

240
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:35,892
On this?

241
00:29:37,975 --> 00:29:39,768
You know there's
planes and trains out, don't you?

242
00:29:42,144 --> 00:29:42,644
You on the run?

243
00:29:43,478 --> 00:29:43,687
Yes.

244
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:45,896
I am.

245
00:29:46,813 --> 00:29:47,980
Come on, then. Come on.

246
00:31:11,264 --> 00:31:14,599
[gunfire]

247
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,225
Mom.

248
00:31:20,392 --> 00:31:21,393
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom.

249
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,398
[birds chirping]

250
00:32:04,452 --> 00:32:24,043
[music playing]

251
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,129
She was weak.

252
00:32:30,005 --> 00:32:31,005
Sick in her mind.

253
00:32:31,546 --> 00:32:32,422
She died because you sent her away.

254
00:32:32,422 --> 00:32:35,465
[shouting]

255
00:32:35,465 --> 00:32:37,424
[shouting]

256
00:32:37,424 --> 00:32:37,633
Sergei!

257
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:42,010
Fear will eat you.

258
00:32:42,843 --> 00:32:43,969
It makes you weak.

259
00:32:45,761 --> 00:32:47,387
Each of us has a path to walk.

260
00:32:50,471 --> 00:32:51,264
They are brave.

261
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:55,431
We eat the pleasure.

262
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:05,502

263
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:06,002

[music playing]

273
00:36:19,515 --> 00:36:20,057
Welcome home.

274
00:36:21,015 --> 00:36:22,433
We stayed under the radar as usual.

275
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:24,476
Call me when you need me again.

276
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,518

279
00:36:54,988 --> 00:36:56,655
Sergei, it is your father.

280
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:57,822
Come home.

281
00:36:58,365 --> 00:36:59,156
I miss you.

282
00:36:59,448 --> 00:37:01,532
I am sorry for
everything that has happened.

283
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:04,533
Just kidding.

284
00:37:04,992 --> 00:37:05,534
It's your brother.

285
00:37:06,409 --> 00:37:07,076
I texted you.

286
00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:08,244
Where have you been?

287
00:37:10,578 --> 00:37:13,079
Oh, you still
hiding out in the woods, huh?

288
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:15,622
Am I going to see you for my birthday?

289
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:17,455
Call me back.

290
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:27,543
[sighing]

291
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,673

[sirens]

293
00:38:14,662 --> 00:38:16,121
Because we can.

294
00:38:30,793 --> 00:38:32,669
Hey, it was leisure.

295
00:38:41,407 --> 00:38:42,115
Because you can?

296
00:38:42,298 --> 00:38:56,679
Go, go!

297
00:38:43,533 --> 00:38:44,074
Out of way.

298
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:46,075
There's six of us and only one of you.

299
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:48,826
There are six of you now.

300
00:38:49,451 --> 00:38:50,869
I ain't got time for
this. I've got deadlines.

301
00:39:30,593 --> 00:39:32,511
[sighing]

302
00:39:51,602 --> 00:39:51,977
Mr. Tegeler.

303
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:54,478
I apologize.

304
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:57,604
This guy, he came out of nowhere.

305
00:39:57,646 --> 00:40:02,190
A crazy local or... I don't know.

306
00:40:03,356 --> 00:40:04,441
But I took care of it.

307
00:40:05,357 --> 00:40:06,692
He won't be bothering us anymore.

308
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,527
In a moment, you won't
be bothered by much of anything.

309
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:14,528
How did you...

310
00:40:16,862 --> 00:40:17,737
Where's Mr. Tegeler?

311
00:40:19,155 --> 00:40:20,530
Oh, you're standing in him.

312
00:40:24,657 --> 00:40:25,615
Found this interesting read.

313
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,701
You're a poacher, Mr. Tegeler.

314
00:40:29,701 --> 00:40:31,618
He hires poachers with these names.

315
00:40:32,952 --> 00:40:34,994
Drugs, weapons, trafficking.

316
00:40:34,994 --> 00:40:35,662
No, no, no, I...

317
00:40:36,162 --> 00:40:36,704
What's your name?

318
00:40:38,371 --> 00:40:38,621
Andre.

319
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,831
The men in that book,
they're the ones you want.

320
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:45,290
They're the ones they
charge. I can help you find them.

321
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:47,291
I don't need your help.

322
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:51,168
But I will be
adding these names to my list.

323
00:40:53,169 --> 00:40:53,794
Andre who?

324
00:40:56,337 --> 00:40:56,628
The maid.

325
00:40:59,546 --> 00:41:00,922
Pretty low on a pecking order, Andre.

326
00:41:02,506 --> 00:41:04,465
Oh, found you.

327
00:41:17,137 --> 00:41:22,639
And now, today's headlines.

328
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:26,807
Crusading London
prosecutor Samantha Hodges

329
00:41:26,807 --> 00:41:29,392
was gunned down
last week in broad daylight.

330
00:41:30,101 --> 00:41:34,853
Following a string of vicious attacks
targeting law enforcement and the judiciary.

331
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:38,979
Memorial services
will be held later today.

332
00:41:44,648 --> 00:41:47,358
I met Samantha when
I first moved to London.

333
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:49,650
She was a mentor,

334
00:41:49,692 --> 00:41:52,901
a dear friend,

335
00:41:54,236 --> 00:41:59,113
and one of the fiercest fighters
for justice this city has ever known.

336
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:03,740
We all know who did this.

337
00:42:05,948 --> 00:42:11,284
Samantha dared to stand in Semyon
Chorny's way and hold him accountable.

338
00:42:12,909 --> 00:42:16,661
And for that act of
courage, she lost her life.

339
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,705
This system's broken.

340
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:36,586
I'm sorry about your friend.

341
00:42:36,586 --> 00:42:36,794
Shit.

342
00:42:38,295 --> 00:42:39,420
I didn't mean to scare you.

343
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:39,879
You did.

344
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,338
Sorry for your loss.

345
00:42:43,256 --> 00:42:44,214
Did you know her well?

346
00:42:45,923 --> 00:42:46,673
Actually, I didn't know her at all.

347
00:42:47,674 --> 00:42:49,841
Well, then thank you for the condolences.

348
00:42:52,968 --> 00:42:53,468
I live so.

349
00:42:57,302 --> 00:43:04,681
I think this belongs to you.

350
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:10,892
You're...

351
00:43:13,184 --> 00:43:13,684
You're the boy.

352
00:43:13,726 --> 00:43:16,477
No, you were...

353
00:43:17,645 --> 00:43:18,145
You were...

354
00:43:18,145 --> 00:43:18,603
I was.

355
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:20,687
For three minutes.

356
00:43:21,729 --> 00:43:23,563
Would have been a whole
lot longer if you hadn't been here.

357
00:43:24,523 --> 00:43:25,814
Those were my grandmother's cards.

358
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:29,275
I actually still carry the dick with me.

359
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,483
So why'd you give it to me?

360
00:43:33,026 --> 00:43:34,485
Yes, I thought you needed it.

361
00:43:36,235 --> 00:43:37,361
Is this how you had to go on?

362
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:38,694
How'd you find me?

363
00:43:38,736 --> 00:43:45,114
Hunting people down is sort of my thing.

364
00:43:46,407 --> 00:43:46,657
Hunting?

365
00:43:48,073 --> 00:43:48,866
You know who did this?

366
00:43:51,074 --> 00:43:51,700
Yeah, I do.

367
00:43:54,035 --> 00:43:54,660
They gonna get him?

368
00:43:55,994 --> 00:43:56,786
Probably not.

369
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:03,705
What would you say if I told you?

370
00:44:03,705 --> 00:44:06,706
I already did. (somber music)

371
00:44:33,759 --> 00:44:38,594
(somber music)

372
00:44:38,594 --> 00:44:45,389
A tiger's tooth?

373
00:44:46,014 --> 00:44:48,015
I use whatever tools are available.

374
00:44:49,723 --> 00:44:50,849
Why would you do that?

375
00:44:51,724 --> 00:44:53,267
Wasn't he
responsible for killing your friend?

376
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,728
Look, I've been trying to
find you for a very long time.

377
00:45:01,395 --> 00:45:03,896
This is my way of saying
thank you for saving my life.

378
00:45:04,229 --> 00:45:05,439
I didn't ask you to murder anyone.

379
00:45:06,105 --> 00:45:06,772
I'm a lawyer.

380
00:45:10,732 --> 00:45:12,400
But that bastard got what he deserved.

381
00:45:16,819 --> 00:45:18,194
I know who your father is.

382
00:45:20,403 --> 00:45:21,070
You're like him?

383
00:45:22,571 --> 00:45:23,154
The gangster?

384
00:45:23,571 --> 00:45:23,737
No.

385
00:45:23,779 --> 00:45:30,657
I grew up watching my
father put evil into the world.

386
00:45:31,658 --> 00:45:33,325
The old man had it all figured out.

387
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:36,618
I was supposed to follow in his footsteps

388
00:45:36,618 --> 00:45:39,244
and take over the family business.

389
00:45:40,703 --> 00:45:42,495
If something happened
to me that day, you found me.

390
00:45:45,663 --> 00:45:49,540
So, I got as far away
from my father as I could.

391
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:51,749
Now I do what I can to
get rid of people who are not.

392
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,417
Now I do what I can to
get rid of people like him.

393
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,585
So you're the hunter?

394
00:45:58,336 --> 00:45:59,961
That's just what
they call me in the press.

395
00:46:02,378 --> 00:46:03,379
I prefer Craven.

396
00:46:04,296 --> 00:46:04,629
Craven?

397
00:46:05,254 --> 00:46:06,714
Mm. With a K.

398
00:46:07,214 --> 00:46:10,298
But the only people who
have heard that name are dead now.

399
00:46:11,591 --> 00:46:13,925
Then I guess I'll
just have to watch my back.

400
00:46:16,051 --> 00:46:16,884
So do you live here?

401
00:46:18,344 --> 00:46:20,761
I live about as far away as
you can possibly get from this place.

402
00:46:23,846 --> 00:46:24,679
But my brother does.

403
00:46:27,138 --> 00:46:28,098
We, um...

404
00:46:31,307 --> 00:46:35,142
I wasn't always there for
him, so I check in when I can.

405
00:46:37,602 --> 00:46:38,102
What about you?

406
00:46:39,143 --> 00:46:39,978
How did you end up here?

407
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:42,562
Some days I'm not so sure.

408
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:48,772
My parents were
lawyers, so that's what I did.

409
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:51,941
I was in the
D.A.'s office in New York for

410
00:46:51,941 --> 00:46:54,567
seven years, until I
couldn't take it anymore.

411
00:46:55,859 --> 00:46:58,026
Sometimes the law can
get in the way of justice.

412
00:46:59,277 --> 00:46:59,777
It can.

413
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:05,571
Now I'm in London, at one
of the biggest law firms in Europe.

414
00:47:07,322 --> 00:47:11,240
I know where you work. You're one of
the best investigative lawyers in that place.

415
00:47:12,491 --> 00:47:13,407
I also know...

416
00:47:15,367 --> 00:47:16,784
all your clients aren't exactly angels.

417
00:47:17,784 --> 00:47:18,910
That's true.

418
00:47:20,869 --> 00:47:22,911
So what are you really
getting down from behind that desk?

419
00:47:25,787 --> 00:47:26,413
I have a list.

420
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:28,288
A list?

421
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,792
There are other ways to do
what you set out to do, Calypso.

422
00:47:49,047 --> 00:47:50,381
Well, you're gonna need a lawyer, or

423
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:52,590
worse, if you keep
messing around in this world.

424
00:47:55,842 --> 00:47:56,759
What about a partnership?

425
00:47:58,135 --> 00:48:02,177
From inside that firm, you can
find people I can't. And then I can...

426
00:48:02,177 --> 00:48:03,095
Yeah, I get it.

427
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:10,097
I'll think about it.

428
00:48:11,515 --> 00:48:11,931
Craven.

429
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:14,432
And a little friendly advice.

430
00:48:14,849 --> 00:48:17,350
If you keep going after the names on that

431
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:21,394
list, people you
care about are gonna get hurt.

432
00:48:31,814 --> 00:48:32,315
Hey.

433
00:48:33,607 --> 00:48:33,857
Pleasure.

434
00:48:34,149 --> 00:48:35,150
We need to talk about this.

435
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:35,941
Yes.

436
00:48:36,691 --> 00:48:37,234
We go again?

437
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:38,817
Go! Go!

438
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:45,529
Did you hear me?

439
00:48:47,113 --> 00:48:47,363
Pleasure.

440
00:48:48,821 --> 00:48:49,697
Calyn, give it here.

441
00:48:50,947 --> 00:48:52,157
Are you going to make me beg?

442
00:48:55,241 --> 00:48:56,033
You know I don't beg.

443
00:48:57,784 --> 00:48:58,825
You think I'm weak?

444
00:49:02,244 --> 00:49:03,202
Good damn thing.

445
00:49:06,829 --> 00:49:07,163
Pleasure!

446
00:49:07,496 --> 00:49:09,664
It's okay, Rezinka.

447
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:11,831
Yes, you're my Rezinka.

448
00:49:11,873 --> 00:49:15,666
Papa loves you. Papa forgets you.

449
00:49:16,082 --> 00:49:16,833
One more thing.

450
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:20,168
Sami and Chauni was
killed in his prison cell.

451
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,294
Who got to him?

452
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:24,920
They're saying he was the hunter.

453
00:49:26,962 --> 00:49:29,797
Faster than a cheetah, cunning as a fox.

454
00:49:31,381 --> 00:49:33,089
More ferocious than a tiger.

455
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:38,842
Tell me.

456
00:49:39,842 --> 00:49:43,219
Do you think this hunter actually exists?

457
00:49:44,011 --> 00:49:44,803
It'd be a load of bollocks.

458
00:49:46,304 --> 00:49:47,804
But then again, I hear he's got a list.

459
00:49:48,388 --> 00:49:51,139
Once you're on it, you never come off.

460
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,433
And there's a good chance you're on it.

461
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:02,393
If it is real, it can be found.

462
00:50:03,852 --> 00:50:04,602
I'll do some digging.

463
00:50:06,437 --> 00:50:06,645
Wait.

464
00:50:09,229 --> 00:50:12,272
Chauni's operations are up for grabs now.

465
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:13,356
Set a meet.

466
00:50:15,441 --> 00:50:16,524
He's top three guys.

467
00:50:40,367 --> 00:50:43,160
Your boss, Sibion Chauni, is dead.

468
00:50:44,411 --> 00:50:48,037
I intend to assume
control of his acid transactions.

469
00:50:48,704 --> 00:50:50,371
One of you will be my partner.

470
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:52,122
Who's it going to be?

471
00:50:54,582 --> 00:50:55,373
Best pitch wins.

472
00:51:02,585 --> 00:51:03,877
Why they call me the Rhino.

473
00:51:09,879 --> 00:51:12,672
Why do it to yourself?

474
00:51:14,631 --> 00:51:19,717
They have to see
who they're dealing with.

475
00:51:27,886 --> 00:51:30,054
He's back, Sibion.

476
00:51:30,512 --> 00:51:37,891
Oh, it's okay, Raja.

477
00:51:38,933 --> 00:51:39,891
It's okay.

478
00:52:08,945 --> 00:52:15,031
[sighs]

479
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:21,408
You can put your guns away.

480
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,535
If I want you dead,
I only have to raise my...

481
00:52:24,535 --> 00:52:24,785
Don't!

482
00:52:30,871 --> 00:52:32,372
Whenever Rhino sees his
opportunity, he doesn't hesitate.

483
00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:35,581
He charges in and takes it.

484
00:52:36,915 --> 00:52:39,125
So I'll ask one more time...

485
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,042
Which one of you
is going to be my partner?

486
00:52:46,628 --> 00:52:49,879
Hell of a pitch.

487
00:52:53,922 --> 00:52:54,922
We have a winner.

488
00:53:35,981 --> 00:53:41,150
[music playing]

489
00:53:45,027 --> 00:53:45,860
My son, Dimitri.

490
00:53:48,111 --> 00:53:49,778
This next one's for you, Papa.

491
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:58,282
It does for me.

492
00:53:58,865 --> 00:54:00,491
He knows I like Tony Bennett.

493
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:01,616
Do you like Tony Bennett?

494
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:04,743
I don't trust anyone
who doesn't like Tony Bennett.

495
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:08,619
He can do anyone.

496
00:54:09,161 --> 00:54:10,037
He's like Chameleon.

497
00:54:13,121 --> 00:54:13,663
He's assassins.

498
00:54:15,539 --> 00:54:17,790
If they can get your boss in cage,

499
00:54:19,249 --> 00:54:21,374
I think we all need to take precautions.

500
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:22,958
I understand.

501
00:54:24,376 --> 00:54:24,834
Come closer.

502
00:54:27,835 --> 00:54:29,795
Jorny, he is gone.

503
00:54:31,336 --> 00:54:33,963
That makes your
operations become vulnerable.

504
00:54:36,005 --> 00:54:39,590
I can offer you security, distribution,

505
00:54:40,382 --> 00:54:43,050
and most critically, peace of mind.

506
00:54:44,592 --> 00:54:44,967
Sounds good.

507
00:54:45,842 --> 00:54:46,427
I'm on board.

508
00:54:48,469 --> 00:54:49,011
Just like that.

509
00:54:50,678 --> 00:54:52,095
You don't want to think about it.

510
00:54:52,345 --> 00:54:53,513
Order has to be restored.

511
00:54:54,763 --> 00:54:55,388
The sooner the better.

512
00:54:58,973 --> 00:55:01,933
You have already done deal, didn't you?

513
00:55:02,683 --> 00:55:02,974
Who is?

514
00:55:02,974 --> 00:55:05,643
The Rhino sends his regards.

515
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:35,697
[yelling]

516
00:55:38,573 --> 00:55:39,031
Get up.

517
00:55:57,664 --> 00:55:57,872
You're hit.

518
00:55:59,247 --> 00:56:00,748
Are you all right, Papa?

519
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:05,959
[clinking]

520
00:56:07,001 --> 00:56:09,419
Look at what they have done to my club.

521
00:56:12,962 --> 00:56:16,088
I get attacked on my own ground.

522
00:56:18,005 --> 00:56:20,215
And who do I have to feed me?

523
00:56:21,131 --> 00:56:23,716
My son, the piano player.

524
00:56:25,508 --> 00:56:26,884
Come on, hit me.

525
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:28,134
Fight me!

526
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:30,760
I need fighters.

527
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:32,345
Look, I want...

528
00:56:34,054 --> 00:56:35,721
You won't even defend yourself.

529
00:56:43,015 --> 00:56:44,183
The Kravinov hit failed.

530
00:56:45,183 --> 00:56:46,309
All of our guys are dead.

531
00:56:57,646 --> 00:56:59,022
Nikolai is a tough old bear.

532
00:56:59,022 --> 00:57:01,023
He won't go quietly.

533
00:57:03,024 --> 00:57:05,984
I found these slips under my door.

534
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:25,283
Nikolai Kravinov's
son, Sergei, is the hunter?

535
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,034
But what is this, a Kravin?

536
00:57:29,869 --> 00:57:31,285
Apparently that's what he calls himself.

537
00:57:32,745 --> 00:57:33,953
This can't be real.

538
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:37,079
Can it?

539
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:38,580
Not sure.

540
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,248
He put the foreigner on this.

541
00:57:41,914 --> 00:57:46,000
He is a bit of a freak, but he's
been obsessed with the hunter for years.

542
00:57:47,376 --> 00:57:50,043
Maybe he can figure
out what the fuck is going on.

543
00:58:31,435 --> 00:58:31,644
One.

544
00:58:34,853 --> 00:58:34,978
Two.

545
00:58:38,397 --> 00:58:38,647
Three.

546
00:58:49,942 --> 00:58:52,903
(gun fires)

547
00:59:00,614 --> 00:59:02,281
I'll be seeing you.

548
00:59:19,955 --> 00:59:20,955
(man laughs)

549
00:59:21,372 --> 00:59:22,080
Oh, that's great.

550
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:22,915
Is it up under the river?

551
00:59:49,967 --> 00:59:51,843
(ominous music)

552
01:00:17,437 --> 01:00:19,146
(ominous music)

553
01:00:19,146 --> 01:00:19,438
Surprise!

554
01:00:20,188 --> 01:00:20,479
(man screams)

555
01:00:20,855 --> 01:00:21,022
Jesus!

556
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:22,397
You're gay!

557
01:00:23,648 --> 01:00:24,773
(man laughs)

558
01:00:25,857 --> 01:00:27,649
You scared the shit out of me.

559
01:00:28,942 --> 01:00:30,693
Happy birthday, baby brother.

560
01:00:31,734 --> 01:00:33,819
Love you, man.

561
01:00:36,695 --> 01:00:37,611
What are we gonna do, huh?

562
01:00:39,862 --> 01:00:40,863
Well, you're not wearing that.

563
01:00:41,363 --> 01:00:42,530
Great, let's stay in.

564
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:42,738
What?

565
01:00:43,364 --> 01:00:44,406
It's my birthday.

566
01:00:45,114 --> 01:00:49,158
On your birthday, we
can go to the petting zoo

567
01:00:49,533 --> 01:00:52,409
or wherever it is you let loose,

568
01:00:52,785 --> 01:00:55,369
but tonight, this.

569
01:00:57,954 --> 01:00:59,745
What makes you think I can fit in that?

570
01:00:59,745 --> 01:01:02,330
This is too big on me,
so it'd be perfect for you.

571
01:01:06,082 --> 01:01:06,248
Sorry.

572
01:01:06,457 --> 01:01:06,957
Thank you.

573
01:01:07,207 --> 01:01:07,458
Pleasure.

574
01:01:08,416 --> 01:01:09,583
Nice perfume, by the way.

575
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,584
Thanks, but I'm not actually wearing any.

576
01:01:14,877 --> 01:01:17,920
She was gonna find out soon enough.

577
01:01:19,546 --> 01:01:21,671
(man grunts)

578
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:23,964
Papa was sitting right here.

579
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:26,173
It all happened so fast.

580
01:01:27,257 --> 01:01:30,758
You find out what you're
made of in a moment like that.

581
01:01:31,092 --> 01:01:31,633
I'm a coward.

582
01:01:31,926 --> 01:01:32,968
You're not a coward.

583
01:01:33,759 --> 01:01:35,344
It's natural to feel fear.

584
01:01:35,344 --> 01:01:36,720
That's just your instinct, talking.

585
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,803
Why don't we get to choose who we are?

586
01:01:39,346 --> 01:01:40,762
Why do I have to be me?

587
01:01:40,762 --> 01:01:42,972
I need to be strong, fearless.

588
01:01:43,263 --> 01:01:44,473
I would run towards the bullets.

589
01:01:44,473 --> 01:01:45,889
I would crumble to the ground.

590
01:01:46,223 --> 01:01:47,765
You know, why would you
want to be anybody but yourself?

591
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:49,766
So you respect me for once.

592
01:01:50,058 --> 01:01:52,767
Papa's a criminal,
so what good is his respect?

593
01:01:53,059 --> 01:01:54,685
You act like you
don't care what he thinks,

594
01:01:54,685 --> 01:01:57,978
that you're above
it, that he can't touch you.

595
01:01:57,978 --> 01:01:58,645
Well, he can.

596
01:01:58,645 --> 01:02:01,521
He made you hate people.

597
01:02:01,813 --> 01:02:02,771
I don't hate people.

598
01:02:04,897 --> 01:02:07,732
I hate what people
do, but I don't hate people.

599
01:02:09,899 --> 01:02:13,485
I guess then, Papa
was right about one thing.

600
01:02:14,068 --> 01:02:14,276
Yeah.

601
01:02:14,943 --> 01:02:15,276
Yes.

602
01:02:16,986 --> 01:02:19,987
Men should be the
only animal that is dreaded.

603
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,613
I'm glad I didn't miss the party.

604
01:02:24,114 --> 01:02:26,865
How could I stay away and miss the chance

605
01:02:27,073 --> 01:02:28,491
and see both my sons?

606
01:02:31,033 --> 01:02:31,283
Dimitri.

607
01:02:33,659 --> 01:02:34,243
What are you?

608
01:02:37,285 --> 01:02:41,954
I don't expect you to
give me a hug, but a handshake?

609
01:02:47,624 --> 01:02:49,916
(sighs)

610
01:02:49,916 --> 01:02:50,083
Tasha.

611
01:02:55,835 --> 01:02:57,794
I just came for one toast,

612
01:02:58,586 --> 01:03:02,921
to honor Dimitri on his big day.

613
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:04,046
For?

614
01:03:09,048 --> 01:03:11,674
For men, not for boys.

615
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:18,177
(somber music)

616
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:20,345
Come on, Sergei.

617
01:03:24,514 --> 01:03:26,681
The Dikrivenovs.

618
01:03:27,515 --> 01:03:30,849
Maybe you'll learn
someday to forget the best

619
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,393
and imagine future together.

620
01:03:36,184 --> 01:03:36,769
It's family.

621
01:03:38,019 --> 01:03:38,727
Vashis Durovia.

622
01:03:39,645 --> 01:03:40,270
Vashis Durovia.

623
01:03:42,229 --> 01:03:42,479
(clicks tongue)

624
01:03:42,479 --> 01:03:43,021
(laughing)

625
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:45,855
Damn you.

626
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:48,732
You okay?

627
01:03:54,234 --> 01:03:54,484
Sergei.

628
01:03:56,318 --> 01:04:01,070
I know why you come every year.

629
01:04:02,487 --> 01:04:08,740
Because you feel
guilty for leaving me with him.

630
01:04:09,532 --> 01:04:11,574
I forgive you for all.

631
01:04:15,993 --> 01:04:16,618
Everything.

632
01:04:22,578 --> 01:04:23,329
I'm sorry.

633
01:04:35,084 --> 01:04:35,293
Sergei!

634
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:39,961
Sergei!

635
01:05:09,765 --> 01:05:09,973
(dramatic music)

636
01:05:10,015 --> 01:05:11,265
I never wanted to get married, did I?

637
01:05:12,516 --> 01:05:13,266
Hold that, will ya?

638
01:05:14,809 --> 01:05:16,142
Please, buddy?

639
01:05:22,937 --> 01:05:23,770
Penhouse, please.

640
01:05:29,815 --> 01:05:30,856
I tried to hold it for you.

641
01:05:30,856 --> 01:05:31,399
No, you didn't.

642
01:05:34,233 --> 01:05:36,443
This, oh, that's my travel knife.

643
01:05:36,818 --> 01:05:37,484
Use it for work.

644
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:38,610
Yeah.

645
01:05:40,235 --> 01:05:40,902
What'd you do for work?

646
01:05:41,445 --> 01:05:41,611
Exactly.

647
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:43,236
I hunt.

648
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:47,655
I'm fine.

649
01:05:47,655 --> 01:05:47,863
I hunt with people.

650
01:05:50,573 --> 01:05:53,825
(audio distorts)

651
01:05:55,075 --> 01:05:55,575
Dimitri!

652
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:05,037
Please, please!

653
01:06:05,663 --> 01:06:06,455
Let go, now!

654
01:06:07,621 --> 01:06:08,414
( (growling)

655
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:24,587
[grunting]

656
01:06:32,048 --> 01:06:34,341
Hey, wait, wait, wait, stop!

657
01:06:34,424 --> 01:06:35,383
Please, please, wait, wait, wait.

658
01:06:35,592 --> 01:06:36,967
We can figure this out.

659
01:06:37,301 --> 01:06:37,593
Put him under.

660
01:06:43,553 --> 01:06:54,808
[grunting]

661
01:06:57,101 --> 01:06:57,601
There he is.

662
01:06:59,101 --> 01:06:59,518
Lose him.

663
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:02,561
Get the fuck out of the way!

664
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,020
Watch it!

665
01:07:14,149 --> 01:07:17,400
[grunting]

666
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:26,738
Fuck!

667
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:31,073
Go!

668
01:07:36,617 --> 01:07:37,242
Faster!

669
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:44,328
Stop!

670
01:07:50,247 --> 01:07:59,084
[grunting]

671
01:08:03,586 --> 01:08:04,794
The matry!

672
01:08:09,588 --> 01:08:12,089
It's bulletproof idiot inside and out!

673
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:15,633
[knocking]

674
01:08:20,593 --> 01:08:21,468
Game off!

675
01:08:23,844 --> 01:08:27,179
[grunting]

676
01:08:44,770 --> 01:08:45,603
[grunting]

677
01:09:16,241 --> 01:09:22,035
[grunting]

678
01:09:22,035 --> 01:09:27,787
[grunting]

679
01:09:27,787 --> 01:09:32,539
Go, go!

680
01:09:35,248 --> 01:09:36,832
[grunting]

681
01:09:45,503 --> 01:09:46,628
Hit!

682
01:10:13,639 --> 01:10:16,682
[grunting]

683
01:10:17,641 --> 01:10:17,974
Demon!

684
01:10:22,643 --> 01:10:22,935
Hello, sir.

685
01:10:23,393 --> 01:10:24,185
Is that something I can hook with?

686
01:10:24,644 --> 01:10:25,394
A towel, maybe.

687
01:10:26,769 --> 01:10:27,478
Thank you so much.

688
01:10:27,937 --> 01:10:29,020
Appreciate it.

689
01:10:32,939 --> 01:10:38,274
Sir, I think you
left your shoes in the lobby.

690
01:10:38,649 --> 01:10:39,442
I'm pretty sure it did.

691
01:10:39,442 --> 01:10:41,442
Why don't we go down
and have a look together?

692
01:10:41,651 --> 01:10:43,276
I'm not sure I have enough
votes in the world then, my friend.

693
01:10:43,943 --> 01:10:45,652
Brian, everything's fine.

694
01:10:45,652 --> 01:10:46,319
He's a client.

695
01:10:47,445 --> 01:10:48,320
What the hell, Sergei?

696
01:10:49,029 --> 01:10:51,112
I told you I'd think about your offer.

697
01:10:51,697 --> 01:10:53,155
You cannot come in here like this.

698
01:10:53,781 --> 01:10:55,156
This is my place of business.

699
01:10:55,156 --> 01:10:55,948
I got my brother.

700
01:10:56,782 --> 01:10:57,657
Who got your brother?

701
01:10:58,115 --> 01:10:59,200
There were four of them.

702
01:11:00,366 --> 01:11:01,326
Took him from his place.

703
01:11:02,367 --> 01:11:03,409
So you saw them?

704
01:11:03,409 --> 01:11:04,368
There's just one guy.

705
01:11:05,994 --> 01:11:09,120
Dark hair, brown eyes,
got a scar on his left eye.

706
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:10,745
Jesus.

707
01:11:11,788 --> 01:11:11,913
Jesus.

708
01:11:11,913 --> 01:11:12,621
You spoke to them.

709
01:11:13,163 --> 01:11:13,914
Not exactly.

710
01:11:15,664 --> 01:11:17,707
There was some screaming involved.

711
01:11:22,417 --> 01:11:22,709
Okay.

712
01:11:24,835 --> 01:11:25,794
Let's get into it then.

713
01:11:28,545 --> 01:11:30,003
I should have been there for one.

714
01:11:31,838 --> 01:11:36,298
I couldn't sleep, so I
left and went for a walk and--

715
01:11:36,673 --> 01:11:37,673
We're gonna find him.

716
01:11:39,674 --> 01:11:40,300
Okay?

717
01:11:42,008 --> 01:11:44,593
I'm gonna do what I do, get us a name,

718
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:49,178
and then you are going to do what you do,

719
01:11:50,387 --> 01:11:51,679
and we will get him back.

720
01:11:53,638 --> 01:11:56,431
I'm looking for a mercenary
just ran a kidnapping hop in London.

721
01:11:57,349 --> 01:11:58,724
Moonshapes, garters, left eye.

722
01:11:59,808 --> 01:12:01,850
Smokes Turkish
cigarettes, probably a national.

723
01:12:03,226 --> 01:12:03,726
Find him.

724
01:12:04,685 --> 01:12:14,355
What you know, don't you?

725
01:12:14,647 --> 01:12:16,522
My list of enemies is long.

726
01:12:20,941 --> 01:12:22,400
Look what they did to him.

727
01:12:23,692 --> 01:12:28,569
(sighs)

728
01:12:34,447 --> 01:12:35,280
How much do they want?

729
01:12:36,781 --> 01:12:39,657
20 million and 48 hours.

730
01:12:44,743 --> 01:12:45,201
Hey, man.

731
01:12:46,494 --> 01:12:47,160
It is complicated.

732
01:12:47,702 --> 01:12:48,494
No, it's not.

733
01:12:48,745 --> 01:12:49,411
It's very simple.

734
01:12:50,578 --> 01:12:52,662
You have the money and he's your son.

735
01:12:53,329 --> 01:12:54,872
This is not about money.

736
01:12:55,497 --> 01:12:56,664
This is about power.

737
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:03,166
If I pay, I am weak.

738
01:13:04,334 --> 01:13:07,502
If I show weakness, I begin to lose

739
01:13:07,835 --> 01:13:09,919
everything I've spent lifetime building.

740
01:13:10,253 --> 01:13:11,754
A lifetime building what?

741
01:13:13,671 --> 01:13:14,796
You're a drug dealer.

742
01:13:19,965 --> 01:13:21,091
You don't get to do that anymore.

743
01:13:22,841 --> 01:13:23,800
Dimitri is innocent.

744
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,635
You let him die,
his blood is on your hands.

745
01:13:28,261 --> 01:13:28,969
On my hands?

746
01:13:30,178 --> 01:13:30,762
My hands?

747
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,346
I did not abandon him.

748
01:13:34,804 --> 01:13:37,014
You abandoned him.

749
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:38,890
You?

750
01:13:42,808 --> 01:13:44,767
He was dead the moment he was taken.

751
01:13:46,101 --> 01:13:47,769
Whether I pay or not.

752
01:13:50,103 --> 01:13:52,103
No, you don't know that.

753
01:13:52,854 --> 01:13:54,604
Yes, I know.

754
01:13:55,855 --> 01:13:57,939
Because that is what I would do.

755
01:13:58,939 --> 01:13:59,481
You're despicable.

756
01:14:00,774 --> 01:14:01,940
Of course I want him back.

757
01:14:03,941 --> 01:14:05,776
I want both my sons back.

758
01:14:10,778 --> 01:14:10,944
Hm.

759
01:14:14,196 --> 01:14:14,280
Some legend you've become.

760
01:14:15,571 --> 01:14:20,407
Wake up.

761
01:14:23,699 --> 01:14:24,200
Take these.

762
01:14:25,575 --> 01:14:26,034
Antibiotics.

763
01:14:26,951 --> 01:14:28,285
Can't have you dying on me, can I?

764
01:14:34,288 --> 01:14:40,498
Can't have you dying on me, can I?

765
01:14:41,291 --> 01:14:46,293
I'm sorry. That's good.

766
01:15:17,931 --> 01:15:18,847
Omer Azdemir.

767
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:23,016
He's holed up in the
monastery in the outskirts of Angkor.

768
01:15:24,016 --> 01:15:24,516
Thank you.

769
01:15:24,849 --> 01:15:26,892
You can thank me
by never calling me again.

770
01:15:27,935 --> 01:15:28,310
We'll see.

771
01:15:34,395 --> 01:15:37,522
How'd it go?

772
01:15:41,023 --> 01:15:42,316
She took it.

773
01:15:42,316 --> 01:15:43,691
Of course she took it.
I'm sorry. Of course she took it.

774
01:15:44,316 --> 01:15:45,275
But did she believe you?

775
01:15:45,942 --> 01:15:47,526
Yeah, she trusts me.

776
01:15:49,819 --> 01:15:51,777
Which is why I want
double what your boss promised.

777
01:15:53,195 --> 01:15:53,403
Double?

778
01:15:55,071 --> 01:15:55,571
Why not triple?

779
01:15:56,988 --> 01:15:57,697
What game are you playing?

780
01:16:02,449 --> 01:16:02,490
One.

781
01:16:05,575 --> 01:16:05,700
Two.

782
01:16:07,701 --> 01:16:07,867
Three.

783
01:16:10,327 --> 01:16:11,327
It's done.

784
01:16:12,328 --> 01:16:21,498
[phone rings]

785
01:16:24,083 --> 01:16:24,583
Get ready.

786
01:16:25,916 --> 01:16:28,585
The hunter is on his way.

787
01:16:30,376 --> 01:16:33,377
Sergei, the man you're
looking for is Omer Azdemir.

788
01:16:34,712 --> 01:16:37,463
I found an old monastery
in his family name in Turkey.

789
01:16:38,422 --> 01:16:40,630
And that is where
you'll find your brother.

790
01:16:42,465 --> 01:16:43,341
Thank you for this.

791
01:16:44,841 --> 01:16:46,342
All right, Ellie. Let's go.

792
01:17:12,352 --> 01:17:14,353
[phone rings]

793
01:17:42,365 --> 01:17:44,366
[phone rings]

794
01:18:12,377 --> 01:18:14,378
[speaking in Turkish]

795
01:18:42,389 --> 01:18:45,516
[gunshot]

796
01:18:45,516 --> 01:18:46,432
[gunshot]

797
01:18:46,432 --> 01:18:47,432
[screams]

798
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,017
Hey!

799
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:49,392
How's your lube?

800
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:53,352
It's him.

801
01:18:53,769 --> 01:18:53,977
What?

802
01:18:55,144 --> 01:18:56,228
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

803
01:18:57,687 --> 01:19:01,438
[screams]

804
01:19:01,438 --> 01:19:04,481

[screams]

810
01:19:14,903 --> 01:19:15,361
He's there.

811
01:19:17,987 --> 01:19:19,696
[gunshots]

812
01:19:19,696 --> 01:19:21,321

814
01:19:23,072 --> 01:19:23,697
Where's the matrix?

815
01:19:25,157 --> 01:19:26,698
[screams]

816
01:19:26,698 --> 01:19:27,616

[screams]

818
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:29,867
Where is he?

819
01:19:31,242 --> 01:19:35,411
Drop me, and you'll
never find your brother, Craven.

820
01:19:35,411 --> 01:19:39,788
[crying]

821
01:19:39,788 --> 01:19:47,749

[screams]

824
01:19:58,045 --> 01:20:02,713
How do you know my name?

825
01:20:03,172 --> 01:20:04,423
Who set me up?

826
01:20:04,423 --> 01:20:06,006
Who took my brother?

827
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:08,215
Vereino.

828
01:20:09,258 --> 01:20:10,716
He's killed us both now.

829
01:20:11,717 --> 01:20:13,927
[gunshots]

830
01:20:13,927 --> 01:20:15,093
[gunshots]

831
01:20:15,093 --> 01:20:15,302
Run!

832
01:20:17,928 --> 01:20:18,762
[gunshots]

833
01:20:18,762 --> 01:20:19,679

834

[gunshots] [gunshots]

837
01:20:43,897 --> 01:20:46,231
This is crushed rosary piece.

838
01:20:48,357 --> 01:20:49,941
The man who did this knows his toxins.

839
01:20:53,026 --> 01:20:53,234
One.

840
01:20:55,944 --> 01:20:56,110
Two.

841
01:20:58,945 --> 01:20:59,070
Three.

842
01:20:59,445 --> 01:21:03,238
[gunshot]

843
01:21:03,238 --> 01:21:03,822
What are you doing?

844
01:21:08,782 --> 01:21:09,199
Pecena.

845
01:21:16,452 --> 01:21:17,453
It's enough, Raja.

846
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:21,162
I'm very sorry about your finger.

847
01:21:21,787 --> 01:21:22,496
Co-eteral damage.

848
01:21:23,746 --> 01:21:24,456
Cut him free.

849
01:21:30,874 --> 01:21:31,625
We met once.

850
01:21:32,834 --> 01:21:34,460
On your father's hunting trip.

851
01:21:35,085 --> 01:21:36,836
I, uh, don't remember.

852
01:21:38,086 --> 01:21:38,711
No, you wouldn't.

853
01:21:39,295 --> 01:21:40,420
My hair was different.

854
01:21:41,629 --> 01:21:42,463
You were very young.

855
01:21:43,421 --> 01:21:43,671
Me?

856
01:21:46,673 --> 01:21:47,506
I never forgot.

857
01:21:50,966 --> 01:21:52,342
So have you spoken to my father?

858
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:55,634
Has he agreed to pay?

859
01:21:56,552 --> 01:21:56,927
No.

860
01:21:58,010 --> 01:22:00,261
Nikolai Kravinov
was never going to hand over

861
01:22:00,261 --> 01:22:02,929
20 million dollars
to get his bastard son back.

862
01:22:05,305 --> 01:22:07,598
You're an accident, Dimitri.

863
01:22:09,932 --> 01:22:12,016
You came into this world as an accident,

864
01:22:12,725 --> 01:22:15,351
and you came into my
possession as an accident.

865
01:22:17,018 --> 01:22:17,560
So can I go?

866
01:22:18,228 --> 01:22:19,353
There's men who took you.

867
01:22:20,103 --> 01:22:21,312
They weren't there for you.

868
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:23,813
They were there for your brother.

869
01:22:24,813 --> 01:22:26,481
Sergei, both of you went in.

870
01:22:27,857 --> 01:22:29,482
But when my guys got up there,

871
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:33,150
oof, he'd vanished, as he always does.

872
01:22:34,817 --> 01:22:35,651
So I took you.

873
01:22:36,735 --> 01:22:37,360
I got lucky.

874
01:22:38,069 --> 01:22:39,486
Why would you ever want Sergei?

875
01:22:40,862 --> 01:22:41,778
He never hurt anyone.

876
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:43,488
I really don't know, do you?

877
01:22:44,238 --> 01:22:44,696
Know what?

878
01:22:51,157 --> 01:22:52,032
Wait for the end.

879
01:22:52,825 --> 01:22:53,492
That's the best part.

880
01:22:58,160 --> 01:22:58,619
Kravin?

881
01:23:07,581 --> 01:23:09,915
Apparently that's
what he calls himself now.

882
01:23:10,915 --> 01:23:13,083
You think my
brother, Sergei, is the hunter?

883
01:23:13,791 --> 01:23:15,209
The hunter is a story,

884
01:23:15,542 --> 01:23:17,710
a fable to put fear into criminals.

885
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:20,503
Clearly you didn't
know your brother very well.

886
01:23:21,169 --> 01:23:22,004
What do you mean didn't?

887
01:23:22,712 --> 01:23:23,712
Kravin had a list.

888
01:23:25,088 --> 01:23:26,547
Once you're on it, you never come off.

889
01:23:34,884 --> 01:23:36,217
So I went to check him first.

890
01:23:44,929 --> 01:23:48,556
Let me record this.

891
01:23:51,266 --> 01:23:52,516
We've got Kravin.

892
01:23:55,517 --> 01:23:56,851
Eh, I don't know about that.

893
01:24:09,689 --> 01:24:13,608
Hello? Eliso, it's me.

894
01:24:13,941 --> 01:24:15,025
The whole thing was a trap.

895
01:24:15,233 --> 01:24:15,692
The Rhino?

896
01:24:16,026 --> 01:24:17,109
He knows who I am.

897
01:24:17,109 --> 01:24:18,110
He'll be after you next.

898
01:24:18,568 --> 01:24:19,402
Sergei, what are you...

899
01:24:20,278 --> 01:24:20,486
Shit.

900
01:24:21,069 --> 01:24:22,528
There are five guys
walking into my building right now

901
01:24:22,528 --> 01:24:24,654
who do not look like they belong here.

902
01:24:25,488 --> 01:24:26,780
You need to get out of there now.

903
01:24:27,113 --> 01:24:29,281
Get to the cargo terminal and stance it.

904
01:24:29,281 --> 01:24:30,532
I'll have someone meet you there.

905
01:24:52,541 --> 01:24:54,917
[dramatic music]

906
01:24:58,209 --> 01:24:59,960
I call this my feed bag.

907
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:06,212
It's a mixture of
medications to manage my condition.

908
01:25:07,463 --> 01:25:08,255
What happened to you?

909
01:25:08,713 --> 01:25:10,464
I was underestimated, too.

910
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:12,799
In and out of hospitals,

911
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:14,716
they never quite knew what was wrong.

912
01:25:15,675 --> 01:25:18,759
I knew I would never
have your father's respect

913
01:25:19,552 --> 01:25:21,553
or anyone else's.

914
01:25:23,219 --> 01:25:24,595
Until I was strong.

915
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,096
I tried everything.

916
01:25:28,055 --> 01:25:28,847
And then...

917
01:25:30,014 --> 01:25:31,014
[dog barking]

918
01:25:31,014 --> 01:25:34,766
I found someone in New York,

919
01:25:36,517 --> 01:25:37,559
a biochemist,

920
01:25:38,267 --> 01:25:40,185
and Professor Miles Warren.

921
01:25:41,144 --> 01:25:47,313
He was developing a
procedure to increase strength tenfold.

922
01:25:50,355 --> 01:25:51,648
I signed up on the spot.

923
01:25:58,276 --> 01:26:00,902
My skin, it started to harden.

924
01:26:01,610 --> 01:26:05,028
I was indestructible,

925
01:26:05,028 --> 01:26:07,737
like a rhino.

926
01:26:09,738 --> 01:26:11,156
But the pain...

927
01:26:14,824 --> 01:26:15,575
It was too much.

928
01:26:15,575 --> 01:26:20,327
[gunshot]

929
01:26:20,327 --> 01:26:34,958
[sighs]

930
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:39,125
I think there is an
animal in each one of us, Dimitri.

931
01:26:41,876 --> 01:26:43,586
I'm taking over your father's territory.

932
01:26:43,586 --> 01:26:45,795
I want you to be my partner.

933
01:26:47,588 --> 01:26:50,130
The Kravinoff name
still opens a lot of doors,

934
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:52,715
and you'll finally get
the consideration you deserve.

935
01:26:55,216 --> 01:26:55,591
You're right.

936
01:26:58,217 --> 01:27:02,594
I have been underestimated my whole life.

937
01:27:08,596 --> 01:27:10,847
But if you think
I'm gonna betray my family,

938
01:27:12,931 --> 01:27:15,349
you're wrong.

939
01:27:22,852 --> 01:27:22,977
Boss.

940
01:27:24,644 --> 01:27:25,478
The boys haven't checked in.

941
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:27,770
I can't reach them.

942
01:27:33,357 --> 01:27:34,148
Kravin is alive.

943
01:27:35,398 --> 01:27:35,941
Hey, Bart!

944
01:27:38,692 --> 01:27:39,609
I'm off with him, probably.

945
01:27:39,609 --> 01:27:42,610
He's here.

946
01:28:09,621 --> 01:28:13,414
[thunder]

947
01:28:13,414 --> 01:28:19,792
[growl]

948
01:28:27,629 --> 01:28:29,087
Cute.

949
01:28:30,505 --> 01:28:34,131
Will your trick still work when
I remove your eyeballs from your head?

950
01:28:35,548 --> 01:28:35,798
Relax.

951
01:28:39,634 --> 01:28:44,844
[engine revs]

952
01:28:49,804 --> 01:28:51,680
Sorry I got you wrapped up in all this.

953
01:28:51,930 --> 01:28:53,055
Any word on Dimitri?

954
01:28:53,722 --> 01:28:54,265
Not yet.

955
01:28:54,723 --> 01:28:58,224
Three of my sources have gone
offline while tracking the rhino's plane.

956
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:01,559
I don't like the feel of this at all.

957
01:29:03,894 --> 01:29:05,310
So, what is this place?

958
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:07,853
My mother's family
used to own this property.

959
01:29:09,646 --> 01:29:12,313
Well, it's really the
only thing I have left from her.

960
01:29:17,649 --> 01:29:18,858
What is happening right now?

961
01:29:19,775 --> 01:29:20,691
We're being hunted.

962
01:29:22,359 --> 01:29:22,859
By who?

963
01:29:25,568 --> 01:29:27,153
[grunting]

964
01:29:38,658 --> 01:29:42,284
[growling]

965
01:29:42,284 --> 01:29:47,870
You don't hunt me!

966
01:29:48,662 --> 01:29:49,578
Yeah, get this.

967
01:29:50,246 --> 01:29:51,829
What are you gonna do? Come on, show me.

968
01:30:01,667 --> 01:30:04,126
I've seen her around
since she was a cub, but...

969
01:30:04,709 --> 01:30:06,127
it's a lot bigger than I remember.

970
01:30:06,669 --> 01:30:09,378
You're a goddamn lunatic, I swear.

971
01:30:09,879 --> 01:30:11,212
Oh, you just figured that out now.

972
01:30:13,213 --> 01:30:15,131
I know I hired you for the job.

973
01:30:16,923 --> 01:30:19,633
But who is craving
to you? Why the obsession?

974
01:30:20,758 --> 01:30:23,467
My mentor was one of the
greatest assassins who ever lived.

975
01:30:23,967 --> 01:30:25,302
He taught me everything I know.

976
01:30:26,093 --> 01:30:27,094
He was like a brother to me.

977
01:30:28,261 --> 01:30:28,928
Maybe you knew him?

978
01:30:30,595 --> 01:30:31,679
Hmm, I'll see him.

979
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:35,431
He was murdered.

980
01:30:36,472 --> 01:30:39,015
One man made it
inside and cut his throat.

981
01:30:40,183 --> 01:30:40,391
Craven?

982
01:30:43,059 --> 01:30:46,769
So I traveled the world,
followed him wherever he went.

983
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:49,770
But Craven is nature's perfect predator.

984
01:30:51,521 --> 01:30:52,688
He has no known weaknesses.

985
01:30:56,898 --> 01:30:57,648
But you found one.

986
01:30:58,774 --> 01:31:00,691
And I know how to exploit it.

987
01:31:00,691 --> 01:31:03,776
I'm going to the part
where I start to give a shit.

988
01:31:06,694 --> 01:31:09,611
These are Eastern Siberian rosary peas.

989
01:31:10,611 --> 01:31:11,404
A rare species.

990
01:31:12,612 --> 01:31:14,780
I found their residue
on a poison in the monastery.

991
01:31:16,114 --> 01:31:19,157
These peas are only native
to a specific region in Siberia.

992
01:31:21,866 --> 01:31:22,700
That's where we'll find them.

993
01:31:41,583 --> 01:31:55,422
Oh, careful with that.)

994
01:31:57,673 --> 01:31:59,298
Actually, I'm pretty
good with one of these things.

995
01:32:00,466 --> 01:32:03,008
Archery at summer camp.

996
01:32:05,718 --> 01:32:06,384
Figuert,

997
01:32:08,344 --> 01:32:10,428
Woodaven's

998
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:11,386
Tribulus.

999
01:32:12,512 --> 01:32:13,221
Mm-hmm.

1000
01:32:14,805 --> 01:32:15,388
Rosary peas?

1001
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:17,723
You seem to know your stuff.

1002
01:32:19,432 --> 01:32:19,974
They'll kill you.

1003
01:32:20,599 --> 01:32:21,390
Or save you.

1004
01:32:22,350 --> 01:32:23,433
Nature's funny like that.

1005
01:32:25,309 --> 01:32:26,267
What are you trying to do here?

1006
01:32:30,478 --> 01:32:31,394
Tell me about this.

1007
01:32:33,229 --> 01:32:34,646
It was my grandmother's.

1008
01:32:36,021 --> 01:32:37,939
We were on safari visiting her that day.

1009
01:32:38,397 --> 01:32:41,399
I've been trying to figure
out what was in here for years.

1010
01:32:43,108 --> 01:32:44,900
My grandmother was kind of a...

1011
01:32:46,401 --> 01:32:46,610
Mystic.

1012
01:32:47,943 --> 01:32:49,152
She had a lot of crazy stuff around.

1013
01:32:51,112 --> 01:32:55,029
My parents didn't like to talk
about it, but she was a very powerful woman.

1014
01:32:57,072 --> 01:32:59,240
She said it would
heal whoever drank it in...

1015
01:33:00,866 --> 01:33:02,032
Undreamed of ways.

1016
01:33:03,325 --> 01:33:04,908
I was... I was just a kid.

1017
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:07,493
I didn't know what it would actually do.

1018
01:33:07,951 --> 01:33:09,035
This saved my life.

1019
01:33:10,119 --> 01:33:10,536
Did it?

1020
01:33:11,078 --> 01:33:12,411
Trust me. Change me.

1021
01:33:12,786 --> 01:33:13,162
Exactly.

1022
01:33:14,912 --> 01:33:15,872
Look at what you became.

1023
01:33:20,289 --> 01:33:22,749
I need to know what was in here.

1024
01:33:26,084 --> 01:33:26,959
And if you can get any more.

1025
01:33:28,168 --> 01:33:28,460
No.

1026
01:33:31,586 --> 01:33:34,045
She died not long after
that trip, and I never saw her again.

1027
01:33:42,508 --> 01:33:43,799
I heard back from one of my sources.

1028
01:33:44,466 --> 01:33:47,343
The rhino's on the move.
We should know more very soon.

1029
01:33:47,968 --> 01:33:49,176
I knew you'd be good at this.

1030
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:55,596
Sergei, we're gonna get Dimitri back.

1031
01:33:57,055 --> 01:33:58,889
But is all of this really worth it?

1032
01:33:59,806 --> 01:34:02,432
Clipso, I was made to do this.

1033
01:34:04,057 --> 01:34:06,225
I'm the greatest hunter
on this planet, it's undeniable.

1034
01:34:07,643 --> 01:34:10,185
There's nobody I can't
track down, nobody I can't beat.

1035
01:34:10,185 --> 01:34:11,978
There's nobody can even touch me, so no.

1036
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:14,437
Why would I want to stop?

1037
01:34:14,437 --> 01:34:16,772
It's called karma. She catches up to you.

1038
01:34:17,772 --> 01:34:21,899
Not me. I'm faster than she is.

1039
01:34:25,483 --> 01:34:27,276
But Dimitri wasn't.

1040
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:38,781
Interesting piece.

1041
01:34:39,656 --> 01:34:41,323
It's gonna take more
than a gun to kill Kraven.

1042
01:34:42,115 --> 01:34:45,491
I find this formula that was
developed by MI6 to be particularly effective.

1043
01:34:47,242 --> 01:34:48,576
May I?

1044
01:34:53,703 --> 01:34:58,080
It first brings on your darkest
nightmares, then paralysis of your vital organs,

1045
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:00,039
before a most violent death.

1046
01:35:01,831 --> 01:35:03,791
I like your style.

1047
01:35:11,877 --> 01:35:16,837
Only one person has this number.

1048
01:35:18,797 --> 01:35:19,963
Dima, where are you?

1049
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:23,090
Sergei, I'm sorry,
they made me call you...

1050
01:35:23,465 --> 01:35:23,799
Dimitri.

1051
01:35:24,757 --> 01:35:27,592
I'm afraid not. But
now you know he is alive.

1052
01:35:27,842 --> 01:35:28,467
What do you want?

1053
01:35:29,301 --> 01:35:31,802
A life without looking over my shoulder.

1054
01:35:33,469 --> 01:35:37,680
You have two choices. I know
you hate your father as much as I do.

1055
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:44,724
So, you and I, and young
Dimitri here, we work together.

1056
01:35:45,141 --> 01:35:46,308
You could be my partners.

1057
01:35:46,849 --> 01:35:48,642
Or I kill you and burn...

1058
01:35:55,103 --> 01:35:57,813
Okay then. Now we go hunt the hunter.

1059
01:36:10,234 --> 01:36:16,321
Spread out.

1060
01:36:18,237 --> 01:36:19,113
Bring me his body.

1061
01:36:20,988 --> 01:36:21,739
Well, don't come back.

1062
01:36:42,664 --> 01:36:42,831
Roger.

1063
01:36:43,748 --> 01:36:49,042
Where is he?

1064
01:36:49,834 --> 01:36:50,835
He's already here.

1065
01:37:48,941 --> 01:37:54,694
Translator,

1066
01:37:54,694 --> 01:37:58,570
(screaming)

1067
01:38:02,697 --> 01:38:05,823
Amateurs, so embarrassing for us.

1068
01:38:06,824 --> 01:38:07,282
Do it.

1069
01:38:10,242 --> 01:38:10,908
Start the run.

1070
01:38:14,785 --> 01:38:17,370
(grunting)

1071
01:38:21,788 --> 01:38:22,830
Fire in the hole.

1072
01:38:24,373 --> 01:38:24,956
Gotta be kidding.

1073
01:38:36,878 --> 01:38:37,003
(exploding)

1074
01:38:37,003 --> 01:38:39,462
(panting)

1075
01:38:53,635 --> 01:39:00,388
(grunting)

1076
01:39:30,775 --> 01:39:32,484
Their
hallucinations are just the beginning.

1077
01:39:35,110 --> 01:39:36,402
Are you seeing your worst nightmare?

1078
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:40,070
One.

1079
01:39:42,738 --> 01:39:42,905
Two.

1080
01:39:46,072 --> 01:39:46,239
Three.

1081
01:39:46,907 --> 01:39:51,033
(panting)

1082
01:39:52,742 --> 01:39:55,910
As the poison makes
its way to your spinal cord,

1083
01:39:55,910 --> 01:39:58,327
you'll begin to lose all motor functions.

1084
01:39:59,120 --> 01:39:59,912
Then it's fixation.

1085
01:40:01,204 --> 01:40:01,913
So you're the legend.

1086
01:40:04,747 --> 01:40:05,205
The myth.

1087
01:40:08,999 --> 01:40:11,333
Well look at you now, you're just a myth.

1088
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:26,673
(grunting)

1089
01:40:28,049 --> 01:40:28,340
Fire.

1090
01:40:32,175 --> 01:40:34,759
(grunting)

1091
01:40:46,972 --> 01:40:48,348
(grunting)

1092
01:40:48,390 --> 01:40:49,723
You give them help, Craven.

1093
01:40:50,808 --> 01:40:53,059
(grunting)

1094
01:41:04,354 --> 01:41:06,980
Honestly, I thought that would be harder.

1095
01:41:11,566 --> 01:41:14,443
It's done, but the
brother's still out there.

1096
01:41:15,109 --> 01:41:15,734
Go find him.

1097
01:41:16,902 --> 01:41:17,444
Let's go.

1098
01:41:20,361 --> 01:41:20,528
One.

1099
01:41:22,696 --> 01:41:22,862
Two.

1100
01:41:23,987 --> 01:41:24,488
(gun firing)

1101
01:41:26,739 --> 01:41:27,489
Three, motherfucker.

1102
01:41:28,573 --> 01:41:30,032
Goodbye, Craven the Hunser.

1103
01:41:35,826 --> 01:41:35,992
Sergei.

1104
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:42,912
Can't catch a break, can you, mate?

1105
01:41:47,206 --> 01:41:53,750
(gasping)

1106
01:42:08,423 --> 01:42:10,340
Legends, don't die.

1107
01:42:10,882 --> 01:42:12,716
Now get the fuck up, Craven.

1108
01:42:13,007 --> 01:42:18,760
(dramatic music)

1109
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:22,678
(gasping)

1110
01:42:25,972 --> 01:42:31,015
I knew you had more of that.

1111
01:42:31,599 --> 01:42:33,975
Well forgive me
for not trusting a lunatic

1112
01:42:34,891 --> 01:42:36,476
with my family's deepest legacy.

1113
01:42:38,727 --> 01:42:39,060
Get up.

1114
01:42:40,811 --> 01:42:41,103
Okay.

1115
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:44,229
(sighing)

1116
01:42:45,355 --> 01:42:46,980
Well that must be some summer, Kent.

1117
01:42:47,814 --> 01:42:49,231
You're not the only one with secrets.

1118
01:42:50,732 --> 01:42:51,982
Don't make me regret this.

1119
01:42:53,983 --> 01:42:57,985
(dramatic music)

1120
01:43:02,903 --> 01:43:03,403
It's over.

1121
01:43:05,404 --> 01:43:05,904
Craven's dead.

1122
01:43:06,113 --> 01:43:11,907
(laughing)

1123
01:43:12,991 --> 01:43:13,574
What a day.

1124
01:43:16,325 --> 01:43:17,243
(laughing)

1125
01:43:20,994 --> 01:43:21,870
Put him in the car.

1126
01:43:23,703 --> 01:43:25,746
Who knows, maybe Nikolai will pay now

1127
01:43:25,746 --> 01:43:27,247
that he has only one son left.

1128
01:43:28,372 --> 01:43:30,956
(dramatic music)

1129
01:43:36,125 --> 01:43:43,044
(dramatic music)

1130
01:43:47,130 --> 01:43:51,507
Does anyone else
see what I'm seeing here?

1131
01:43:54,799 --> 01:43:59,010
(engine revving)

1132
01:44:06,138 --> 01:44:17,726
(dramatic music)

1133
01:44:17,726 --> 01:44:23,520
(crashing)

1134
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:28,563
(screaming)

1135
01:44:36,150 --> 01:44:51,239
(dramatic music)

1136
01:44:52,198 --> 01:44:53,032
Craven!

1137
01:44:53,032 --> 01:44:58,909
(dramatic music)

1138
01:45:05,620 --> 01:45:06,370
Gosh, you're really heavy.

1139
01:45:09,205 --> 01:45:33,924
(screaming) (dramatic music)

1140
01:45:33,924 --> 01:45:35,549
(screaming)

1141
01:45:37,716 --> 01:45:56,058
Suggie. (dramatic music)

1142
01:45:56,058 --> 01:45:59,767
(crashing)

1143
01:45:59,767 --> 01:46:07,145
(grunting)

1144
01:46:07,145 --> 01:46:10,189
(grunting)

1145
01:46:10,189 --> 01:46:12,105
(groaning)

1146
01:46:12,105 --> 01:46:16,024
(dramatic music)

1147
01:46:16,024 --> 01:46:17,650
(grunting)

1148
01:46:23,527 --> 01:46:36,949
(dramatic music)

1149
01:46:36,949 --> 01:46:39,408
(groaning)

1150
01:46:39,408 --> 01:46:40,742
(crashing)

1151
01:46:40,742 --> 01:46:42,202
(dramatic music)

1152
01:46:42,202 --> 01:46:56,082
(groaning) My father
was right about one thing.

1153
01:46:57,833 --> 01:46:58,666
You are nothing.

1154
01:47:02,876 --> 01:47:05,794
(dramatic music)

1155
01:47:05,794 --> 01:47:08,879
(crashing)

1156
01:47:08,879 --> 01:47:11,547
(groaning)

1157
01:47:11,547 --> 01:47:16,257
(groaning)

1158
01:47:16,257 --> 01:47:21,134
(dramatic music)

1159
01:47:23,134 --> 01:47:26,636
(groaning)

1160
01:47:26,636 --> 01:47:35,306
(crashing)

1161
01:47:35,306 --> 01:47:38,183
(groaning)

1162
01:47:38,183 --> 01:47:38,683
(groaning)

1163
01:47:38,683 --> 01:47:41,059
(crashing)

1164
01:47:41,059 --> 01:47:42,351
(groaning)

1165
01:47:42,351 --> 01:47:43,102
(crashing)

1166
01:47:47,728 --> 01:47:50,521
(crashing)

1167
01:47:50,521 --> 01:47:56,148
(groaning)

1168
01:47:56,148 --> 01:48:02,735
(coughing)

1169
01:48:03,026 --> 01:48:04,651
It's no video of me, how did you get it?

1170
01:48:06,611 --> 01:48:07,236
(coughing)

1171
01:48:08,445 --> 01:48:08,903
Who sent it?

1172
01:48:10,238 --> 01:48:10,988
(groaning)

1173
01:48:11,154 --> 01:48:14,697
How is it that even the great hunter

1174
01:48:15,115 --> 01:48:19,992
can't see what was
always right in front of him?

1175
01:48:21,367 --> 01:48:25,035
(coughing)

1176
01:48:25,035 --> 01:48:27,328
(crunching)

1177
01:48:32,247 --> 01:48:32,455
No.

1178
01:48:35,039 --> 01:48:36,832
He deserves to die.

1179
01:48:37,457 --> 01:48:37,874
He will.

1180
01:48:39,165 --> 01:48:40,625
But Demetria is not you.

1181
01:48:45,627 --> 01:48:54,631
(dramatic music)

1182
01:48:55,506 --> 01:48:55,881
I wish,

1183
01:48:58,632 --> 01:49:03,092
I wish I never met you, Kravinovs.

1184
01:49:04,426 --> 01:49:06,594
(groaning)

1185
01:49:15,139 --> 01:49:17,806
(dramatic music)

1186
01:49:17,806 --> 01:49:25,518
(door opening)

1187
01:49:28,603 --> 01:49:28,811
Whoa.

1188
01:49:31,354 --> 01:49:33,397
(growling)

1189
01:49:35,523 --> 01:49:41,816
(growling)

1190
01:49:43,859 --> 01:49:46,652
Tharga, how did you find me?

1191
01:49:48,111 --> 01:49:48,736
I'm a hunter.

1192
01:49:51,112 --> 01:49:53,238
It's what we do.

1193
01:49:57,281 --> 01:50:02,199
You sent the video
and told the rhino who I was.

1194
01:50:04,575 --> 01:50:07,869
Did you really think
Father would not recognize

1195
01:50:07,869 --> 01:50:09,369
actions of his own son?

1196
01:50:10,578 --> 01:50:13,079
An assassin who uses all the methods

1197
01:50:13,079 --> 01:50:15,039
of animals of the jungle?

1198
01:50:17,873 --> 01:50:21,124
You of all people
should recognize and appreciate

1199
01:50:21,124 --> 01:50:23,208
the beauty of the trap I set.

1200
01:50:25,709 --> 01:50:29,503
The rhino has come for you.

1201
01:50:31,336 --> 01:50:32,087
He went strong enough
that he could not be found.

1202
01:50:32,254 --> 01:50:33,837
You had to fight
him off by yourself, huh?

1203
01:50:34,338 --> 01:50:34,672
Exactly.

1204
01:50:36,463 --> 01:50:40,799
But my son, my real son, Kravin,

1205
01:50:42,883 --> 01:50:43,926
no one is stronger.

1206
01:50:46,092 --> 01:50:50,553
And I knew you
would not go after him for me.

1207
01:50:53,137 --> 01:50:54,513
So I sent him after you.

1208
01:50:56,764 --> 01:50:57,347
Some trap.

1209
01:50:57,722 --> 01:51:00,933
(sighing)

1210
01:51:01,349 --> 01:51:02,724
I mean, Dimitri could have died,

1211
01:51:02,724 --> 01:51:04,267
but that's the price
of doing business, right?

1212
01:51:04,517 --> 01:51:06,101
No, no, no, no, no.

1213
01:51:06,268 --> 01:51:10,311
Because I know you
would not let anything happen

1214
01:51:10,519 --> 01:51:11,895
to our precious Dimitri.

1215
01:51:14,021 --> 01:51:15,939
Our empire is secure.

1216
01:51:16,439 --> 01:51:17,105
So what now?

1217
01:51:18,148 --> 01:51:22,524
Papa, we forget about the past.

1218
01:51:23,900 --> 01:51:25,818
Imagine a future together.

1219
01:51:27,985 --> 01:51:29,444
His family.

1220
01:51:44,450 --> 01:51:46,451
Sergei, where are you going?

1221
01:51:53,329 --> 01:51:57,080
I could have come for you years ago.

1222
01:51:59,122 --> 01:51:59,915
But I didn't.

1223
01:52:02,124 --> 01:52:03,291
After everything you'd done,

1224
01:52:04,208 --> 01:52:06,000
all the pain you put in the world,

1225
01:52:09,586 --> 01:52:10,336
you were my father.

1226
01:52:12,878 --> 01:52:13,587
I still am.

1227
01:52:15,921 --> 01:52:16,213
Sit.

1228
01:52:27,718 --> 01:52:30,260
(somber music)

1229
01:52:30,594 --> 01:52:31,511
Never fear death.

1230
01:52:34,096 --> 01:52:35,012
Isn't that what you taught me?

1231
01:52:39,598 --> 01:52:42,724
(ominous music)

1232
01:52:42,724 --> 01:52:53,311
(phone ringing)

1233
01:52:57,771 --> 01:52:59,189
(growling)

1234
01:52:59,189 --> 01:53:08,985
(somber music)

1235
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:20,698
I feel unhappy

1236
01:53:23,574 --> 01:53:25,283
I feel so sad

1237
01:53:27,909 --> 01:53:30,202
I've lost the best friend

1238
01:53:32,369 --> 01:53:34,661
That I'll ever had

1239
01:53:39,413 --> 01:53:44,499
I'm going to change it

1240
01:53:52,753 --> 01:53:53,794
Happy birthday, Dima.

1241
01:53:55,004 --> 01:53:55,920
It is a happy birthday.

1242
01:53:58,296 --> 01:53:59,255
First one in a long time.

1243
01:54:00,547 --> 01:54:01,882
And that's thanks to you, Sergei.

1244
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:03,923
Oh, come on.

1245
01:54:03,923 --> 01:54:05,133
Or Craven, should I say.

1246
01:54:05,674 --> 01:54:06,549
What do I call you now?

1247
01:54:07,300 --> 01:54:08,050
Mr. Craven?

1248
01:54:08,092 --> 01:54:08,842
You know who I am.

1249
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:09,760
I know you.

1250
01:54:13,802 --> 01:54:17,638
That was hell, what I went through.

1251
01:54:18,388 --> 01:54:20,389
But it also freed me.

1252
01:54:21,765 --> 01:54:25,474
I feel almost born again.

1253
01:54:27,808 --> 01:54:30,143
I found a doctor in New York.

1254
01:54:30,768 --> 01:54:32,894
A little unorthodox, I must admit.

1255
01:54:34,353 --> 01:54:37,396
But he really helped me.

1256
01:54:37,854 --> 01:54:41,523
I mean, changed me.

1257
01:54:42,856 --> 01:54:43,273
How so?

1258
01:54:43,815 --> 01:54:44,440
Hang on a sec.

1259
01:54:47,566 --> 01:54:49,817
(speaking in foreign language)

1260
01:54:53,903 --> 01:54:56,029
Since when did you
have friends in the brotha, huh?

1261
01:54:56,362 --> 01:54:57,695
Well, I have business, lots of people.

1262
01:54:58,030 --> 01:54:58,321
Business?

1263
01:54:59,155 --> 01:55:00,906
I thought you said you
were gonna sell Papa's assets

1264
01:55:00,906 --> 01:55:01,906
and get out of the business.

1265
01:55:02,281 --> 01:55:03,198
I changed my mind.

1266
01:55:03,782 --> 01:55:05,240
Dima, I didn't pull your ass out to fire,

1267
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:06,408
so you can become a man like our father.

1268
01:55:06,866 --> 01:55:07,408
Are you serious?

1269
01:55:08,075 --> 01:55:10,285
You put my ass in that fire.

1270
01:55:10,951 --> 01:55:12,535
You're a man just like our father.

1271
01:55:12,535 --> 01:55:13,744
No, I'm nothing like him.

1272
01:55:14,494 --> 01:55:15,287
I have a code.

1273
01:55:15,287 --> 01:55:16,287
And you're different than him.

1274
01:55:16,287 --> 01:55:17,287
I'm better than him.

1275
01:55:17,370 --> 01:55:19,329
You're not better than him.

1276
01:55:19,913 --> 01:55:20,580
You're worse.

1277
01:55:22,456 --> 01:55:23,915
How did Papa die again?

1278
01:55:26,332 --> 01:55:27,375
A hunting accident.

1279
01:55:28,583 --> 01:55:29,042
Was it?

1280
01:55:30,001 --> 01:55:30,793
Don't lie to me.

1281
01:55:32,585 --> 01:55:34,836
You think you have
some kind of honor, huh?

1282
01:55:35,753 --> 01:55:36,545
Some kind of code.

1283
01:55:37,879 --> 01:55:38,212
Bullshit.

1284
01:55:40,047 --> 01:55:45,007
You're just another
man hunting for a trophy.

1285
01:55:45,049 --> 01:55:53,177
(dramatic music)

1286
01:55:55,136 --> 01:55:55,303
Hey.

1287
01:55:59,263 --> 01:55:59,596
Dimitri.

1288
01:56:08,474 --> 01:56:10,100
You should see the look on your face.

1289
01:56:15,061 --> 01:56:17,812
(dramatic music)

1290
01:56:20,063 --> 01:56:20,229
Hey.

1291
01:56:25,065 --> 01:56:25,356
Dimitri.

1292
01:56:27,024 --> 01:56:27,691
You know me.

1293
01:56:28,858 --> 01:56:30,192
I've always been a chameleon.

1294
01:56:32,234 --> 01:56:34,152
It's the one thing I was ever good at.

1295
01:56:35,194 --> 01:56:36,028
Who is this doctor?

1296
01:56:37,486 --> 01:56:38,196
What did he do to you?

1297
01:56:38,237 --> 01:56:39,446
You want me to be weak,

1298
01:56:40,362 --> 01:56:42,738
so then you can be
strong, but I'm strong now.

1299
01:56:43,781 --> 01:56:46,032
I can be whoever I want to be.

1300
01:56:46,532 --> 01:56:48,783
The rhino is gone, dad is gone.

1301
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:50,241
It's all just there.

1302
01:56:51,576 --> 01:56:52,326
For the taking.

1303
01:56:54,743 --> 01:56:55,911
I'm gonna take it.

1304
01:57:00,205 --> 01:57:02,496
You know I can't let you do that.

1305
01:57:07,165 --> 01:57:07,958
Go home, Craven.

1306
01:57:14,001 --> 01:57:15,044
Dad left you something.

1307
01:57:26,631 --> 01:57:49,225
(singing in foreign language)
(dramatic music)

1308
01:57:50,058 --> 01:57:53,684
Sergei, each of us has path to walk.

1309
01:57:55,435 --> 01:57:57,144
Embrace who you really are,

1310
01:57:58,061 --> 01:57:59,895
and you will have
the strength to walk it.

1311
01:58:01,605 --> 01:58:03,021
You are more than my child.

1312
01:58:05,564 --> 01:58:06,106
You are me.

1313
01:58:08,691 --> 01:58:09,691
And I am you.

1314
01:58:12,817 --> 01:58:15,860
(singing in foreign language)

1315
01:58:16,194 --> 01:58:16,902
We are hunters.

1316
01:58:19,987 --> 01:58:21,988
The greatest the world has ever known.

1317
01:58:24,030 --> 01:58:27,656
