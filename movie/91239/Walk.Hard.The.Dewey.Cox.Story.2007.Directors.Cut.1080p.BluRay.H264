1
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:58,184
Mr. Cox?

2
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:01,893
Guys, l need Cox.

3
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:07,154
He goes on in two minutes
and l can't find him.

4
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,025
Mr. Cox.

5
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,079
Mr. Cox?

6
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:20,286
You're gonna have to give him
a moment, son.

7
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:25,036
Dewey Cox needs to think about
his entire life before he plays.

8
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,569
Come on, Nate, let's go play.

9
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,991
I can't, Dewey. l gotta practice.

10
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,000
You can't practice all the time, Nate.
You're already perfect.

11
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:04,834
All right. Come on, Dewey,
let's go play!

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,420
-Today's gonna be the best day ever!
-Yeah!

13
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,336
Ain't nothing horrible
gonna happen today.

14
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,087
What do you wanna be
when you grow up, Dewey?

15
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,969
I don't know. Never really
thunk about it before.

16
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,847
When I grow up,
I'm gonna be a great composer.

17
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,965
And a professional baseball player.

18
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:26,022
Then l'm gonna be an astronaut,
and l'm gonna go to the moon.

19
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:29,108
There's nothing I won't do
with this long, long life of mine.

20
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:30,611
For sure.

21
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:34,566
That's what's great about being young.
So much time to do great things.

22
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,778
Let's go play!

23
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,791
My turn!

24
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,212
I got him! I got him!

25
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,459
Catch!

26
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,125
Chicken!

27
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,988
I challenge you to a duel, sir.

28
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,445
I don't know, Nate.

29
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,485
You know how mad Pa gets
when we play with his machetes.

30
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,790
Come on. There's nothing wrong
with a little machete-fighting.

31
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,285
Now, en garde!

32
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,004
-Do you yield, sir?
-Never!

33
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,474
Prepare to meet your maker.

34
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,520
-Dewey!
-Nate!

35
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,307
I'm halved!

36
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,191
Oh, we should've listened to Pa.

37
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,398
Dewey, l'm cut in half pretty bad.

38
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:00,276
In case I don't make it,
then you'll have to be double great...

39
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,989
...for the both of us.

40
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,372
Wow, that's a lot of pressure, Nate.

41
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,946
You can handle it, Dewey.
Now, run, get Pa!

42
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,840
Holy shit.

43
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:21,554
This was a particularly bad case
of somebody being cut in half.

44
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:27,064
I was not able to reattach
the top half of his body...

45
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,055
...to the bottom half of his body.

46
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,864
Speak English, doc!
We ain't scientists.

47
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,150
I'm sorry, folks. He's gone.

48
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:36,897
Oh, no!

49
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,489
Oh, my God.

50
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:40,954
Dear God. Oh, Dewey.

51
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,914
It's all your fault, Dewey Cox.

52
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:46,285
Oh, Pa, you don't mean that.
It's not his fault.

53
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,793
He cut him in half with a machete.

54
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,077
No.

55
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,089
You. You're not half the boy
that Nate was.

56
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,252
You're not even half the boy
that the top half of Nate was...

57
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,222
...after you cut him in half.

58
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:03,143
So you're saying I'm less than
a quarter of the boy Nate was?

59
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,852
The wrong kid died.

60
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,439
Ma, l can't smell anything.

61
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,561
You can't smell anything?

62
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,226
I think I lost my sense of smell.

63
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,781
You gone smell-blind, son.

64
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,565
It'll pass, Dewey.

65
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:27,235
Now, you run on down to the country
store and get us some butter.

66
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,004
And a candle.

67
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,579
We're gonna light us
a candle tonight.

68
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,300
I'm a gamblin' man

69
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,810
I gambled everywhere I go

70
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,151
Lord, l'm a gamblin' man

71
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:00,149
Gambled everywhere l go

72
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,824
I'm a gamblin' man

73
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,911
Lord, l gambled from door to door

74
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,979
I've never heard no music
like that before.

75
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,017
It's so sad.

76
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,281
That's why it's called the blues, boy.

77
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:44,067
I think I'd like to play me
some blues.

78
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:48,777
Ain't no 6-year-old boy understand
the true meaning of the blues.

79
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,080
I reckon I might.

80
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:52,953
You play the guitar?

81
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,251
Never have before.
But l'm a real fast learner.

82
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,036
Well, go ahead.

83
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,841
You put your finger right up there.
Place your hands here. That's it.

84
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,179
That's the G chord.

85
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,762
Now hit the strings
with your other hand.

86
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,312
-That's it.
-There you go.

87
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,070
That ain't bad.

88
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:33,908
I done a bad thing

89
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,080
Cut my brother in half

90
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:48,342
I done a bad, bad thing

91
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,430
Cut my brother in half

92
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:03,688
My mama's gonna cry

93
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:09,446
Somewhere the devil's havin' a laugh

94
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,617
It's not bad for your first time.

95
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,791
You can do it, Dewey.
You'll be double great.

96
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,996
For the both of us.

97
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,055
Dewey?

98
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,978
Dewey.

99
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,692
Dewey?

100
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,898
Mama, you made it!

101
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,606
There's my favorite 14-year-old son.

102
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,488
Oh, no. Come on, now.
Not in front of the fellas.

103
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,736
Howdy, boys.

104
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,697
Howdy, Mrs. Cox.

105
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,408
I just wanted to say break a leg.

106
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,948
I know you boys are gonna
play a real good song.

107
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,412
Oh, thanks, Ma.

108
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm just so proud you learned to play
the guitar so good.

109
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,959
Without even having
a sense of smell.

110
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,050
It's all right now, Mama.
I learned how to play by ear.

111
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,336
You just go out there
and sing your heart out.

112
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,350
I will, Mama.

113
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,675
I don't know what we're doing here
at this high school talent show.

114
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,890
We're here to see our boy,
that's what we're doing here.

115
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,943
You all right, ma'am?

116
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,864
I'm fine.

117
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:32,574
Just my vertigo acting up again.

118
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,869
-What's vertigo?
-Just a little dizziness is all.

119
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,909
Ain't nothing terrible
ever came from no dizziness.

120
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,372
Testing, testing.

121
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,130
Crawdad, crawdad.

122
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,586
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to the annual talent show.

123
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:55,086
We're gonna get this going here with
the juggling talents of Johnny McGraw.

124
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,409
-How we gonna follow that?
-Delilah Montgomery.

125
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,959
-Delilah Montgomery.
-Very nice!

126
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,423
And now sophomore Dewey Cox
is gonna sing us a song.

127
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,416
So, ladies and germs....

128
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,174
I know, I know.

129
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:38,262
Please welcome Dewey Cox
and the Dewey Cox Four.

130
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,614
Hi. My name's Dewey Cox.

131
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:55,276
And this is a little song l wrote called
"Take My Hand."

132
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:56,857
I sure hope you like it.

133
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:00,281
The wrong kid died, goddamn it.

134
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,208
-Take
-Take, take

135
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,706
Take my hand

136
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,340
We're gonna walk through the рark

137
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:19,927
I promise to have you
Home before dark

138
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,306
Home before dark

139
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:25,484
Oh, life would be so sweet

140
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,150
Walking with you down the street

141
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,151
This music is an outrage!

142
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:36,609
Come on and take my hand

143
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,860
It's the devil's music!

144
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,532
It's all right if you're coy

145
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,622
After all l'm a boy

146
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,290
And you're a girl

147
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,668
But make no mistake

148
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:54,462
Yours is the hand
I want to take

149
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,261
So please

150
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,474
So please, please

151
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,545
Take my hand

152
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,970
You're going to hell!

153
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,638
Blasphemer!

154
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,516
That's it. I want you
out of this house, boy.

155
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,149
-Pa!
-You heard the preacher.

156
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,857
You think we don't know
what you're talking about...

157
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,528
...when you say "take my hand"?

158
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,316
What? lt's about holding hands.

159
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,530
You watch your mouth.

160
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,789
You know who's got hands?
The devil.

161
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,043
And he uses them for holding.

162
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,424
I ain't got no room in my house
for no devil's spawn.

163
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,924
Be careful. Before you say something
you regret for the rest of your days.

164
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,719
Like what?
Like "the wrong kid died"?

165
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,013
Oh, no! No!

166
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,046
It's okay.
It's okay, Mama, settle down.

167
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,064
Pa's right.

168
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,060
Springberry ain't big enough
for me no more.

169
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,057
I reckon it's time for Dewey Cox
to move on.

170
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,071
But you're only 14.

171
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,693
Mama, l love you.

172
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,904
But l don't need nobody.

173
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,241
All I need is my music.

174
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,912
I seen my path today,
and l'm gonna take it.

175
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,578
And someday,
I'll make my masterpiece...

176
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,538
...and you'll all be proud of me.

177
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,420
Just like you were of Nate.

178
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,840
Can l come, Dewey?

179
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,716
Of course you can, Edith.
You're my girlfriend.

180
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,434
-l am?
-Yeah, silly.

181
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,894
I pointed at you in the audience.

182
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:29,637
Did you hear that?
I'm Dewey's 1 2-year-old girlfriend!

183
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,599
You're the most talented man
I've ever seen in my whole life.

184
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,570
And you will never get anything
but love and support from me...

185
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,613
...for you and your dreams
the rest of my life.

186
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:43,067
Well, then, go on.
Get out of this house.

187
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:47,619
Before I cut your dreams in half
like you cut mine in half.

188
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,745
Goodbye, Pa.

189
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,791
Just wait till you see
what happens now.

190
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,212
Here we go.

191
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,005
Ma and Pa leave home
All the kids get glad

192
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,045
You know our house's
Gonna jumр like mad

00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,657
Play it for me, daddy!

199
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,674
That's a sexy look right there.

200
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,384
Oh, l like it, I like it.

201
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,836
Let's jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jumр

00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:48,182
Jump, jump, jumр
Jump, jump, jumр

00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,716
We're gonna jump, li'l children
Mama and Papa's gone

204
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,181
You know what l'm saying.

205
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:56,191
We're gonna jump, li'l children
Mama and Papa's gone

206
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,024
Let's take them home, fellas.

207
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:02,399
We're gonna jump, li'l children
Mama and Papa's gone

208
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,486
Yeah, baby. Wrap it up right there.

209
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,572
I'm gonna take one of them
home tonight.

210
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,075
My name is Bobby Shad
and these are the Bad Men.

211
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,445
We gonna take a break,
then we be right back...

212
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,252
...to rock till the morning light,
all right?

213
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,464
Mr. Shad! Mr. Shad!
Wow, that was really great.

214
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,801
Hey, I play a little guitar.
If you ever need--

215
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,257
-Dewey!
-Yes, sir?

216
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,388
I pay you to mop,
not bother the band.

217
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:34,555
My customers come to dance erotically,
and they need a clean floor to do it on!

218
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,726
Do your job or l'll find
somebody who will.

219
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,564
Yes, sir.

220
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:46,902
Lonesome blues

221
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,241
Dewey, will you cut out that racket?
I'm trying to feed your child!

222
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,158
How am l supposed to make it as
a famous musician if I don't practice?

223
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,708
Will you stop talking
about that music?

224
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,331
But it's my dream, baby.

225
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,829
I am tired of hearing about
your dreams, Dewey Cox.

226
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,172
You are a selfish dickhole.

227
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:07,796
Daddy said if we move home, he could
give you a job at the slaughterhouse.

228
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,547
You can make an honest living.

229
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:13,809
Wouldn't have to hang your head in
shame, walking around like a failure.

230
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,983
I think I'm doing okay for a 1 5-year-old
with a wife and a baby.

231
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,773
But, sweetheart...

232
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,806
...l thought you liked working
at the slaughterhouse for my daddy.

233
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,442
I did.

234
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:29,651
You got a real talent for this, boy.

235
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:33,662
Someday this is all gonna be yours.

236
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:39,209
It's just, as much as I loved it, Edith,
I want more than that.

237
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,963
Ain't no musician ever made
no money, Dewey.

238
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,884
What? Of course they do.
Plenty of them do.

239
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,337
Name one.

240
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,637
-Slim Whitman.
-Who the hell is Slim Whitman?

241
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,303
All right, Frank Sinatra.

242
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,931
Who the hell is Frank Sinatra?

243
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,888
Edith, l am starting to think...

244
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,896
...that maybe
you don't believe in me.

245
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,108
I do believe in you.

246
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,153
I just know you're gonna fail.

247
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:10,108
-What are you talking about, Edith?
-What about my dreams?

248
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,989
Edith, l told you,
I can't build you a candy house!

249
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,487
It will fall down! The sun will
melt the candy! It won't work!

250
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,121
It will if it never rains.

251
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,170
Dewey, you have got
to give up your dream.

252
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:27,498
Dreams don't come true.

253
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,974
I am gonna make
this dream come true.

254
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,427
Nobody ever said it's gonna be easy.

255
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,678
It's hard.

256
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,690
It ain't easy to walk
to the top of a mountain.

257
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,185
It's a long, hard walk.

258
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,356
It's a rocky road.

259
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,355
But l plan on walking.

260
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,072
Oh, l'm gonna walk.

261
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,568
Hard.

262
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,873
I will walk hard.

263
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,839
Walk hard.

264
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,677
I got a full house coming tonight.

265
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,433
If Bobby Shad can't play,
I need to find someone who can.

266
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,886
I'm fine. I can play through the pain.

267
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:22,386
Should've thought before you punched
your landlord and got laryngitis.

268
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,230
I guess there's no music tonight.

269
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:27,725
Bullhickey! People come here
to dance erotically!

270
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,608
I ain't got no music,
I ain't got no nightclub.

271
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,784
Excuse me.

272
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,107
I play a little.

273
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,782
I don't know how
to tell you this, boy.

274
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,161
You're white.
This crowd will eat you alive.

275
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,960
I been watching Mr. Shad every night.
I know all the songs.

276
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,285
It'll be the same show.

277
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,800
It'll be just like Bobby Shad and the
Bad Men, only it'll be me tonight.

278
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,593
This is crazy.

279
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,638
But l ain't got no other choice.

280
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,427
I don't mean to put more
pressure on you, boy.

281
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:07,021
The suits from the record company
just got here.

282
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,147
Oh, okay.

283
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,033
Scared?

284
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,449
-A little.
-Well, you should be.

285
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,906
Those Jews control show business.

286
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,697
Just lay it down
exactly like Bobby does.

287
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:30,342
Good evening. We're Bobby Shad
and the Bad Men. l'm Dewey Cox.

288
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:34,173
Bobby Shad couldn't be here tonight
so l'm gonna do his show for you.

289
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,218
And l hope you enjoy it.

290
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:41,553
This first song
we're fitting to do is....

291
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,472
Well, it's about....

292
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,139
It's about when your woman
catches you.

293
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,271
You know, she catches you
running around town...

294
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,649
...getting into all kinds of strange.

295
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,317
This is racially insensitive.

296
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:59,655
And she says, "Son, get your lazy,
two-timing, Negro ass up out of here."

297
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,834
-And you say to her:
-What's he doing? You see that?

298
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:13,884
You got to love your Negro man

299
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,588
You got to love, love

300
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,296
-ls he playing "Negro Man"?
-He is playing "Negro Man."

301
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,007
He's playing "Negro Man."

302
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,757
From early in the morning
Till late at night

303
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,430
You know l love your apples
Let me take a bite

304
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,519
You got to love your Negro man

305
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,018
You got to love, love, love, love, love

306
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,940
Your Negro man

307
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,529
Yeah, come on, Dewey.

308
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,864
I know I treat you wrong
And that ain't right

309
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,569
Let me рut it on you, mama
And you'll feel all right

310
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:46,871
You got to love your Negro man

311
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,504
You got to love, love, love, love, love

312
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,705
Your Negro man

313
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:05,219
Now, that's what l call
winning over an audience.

314
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,517
Go, Dewey, go.

315
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:18,648
I like what you did out there tonight.
Have you ever made a recording?

316
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,239
Oh, Mr. L'Chaim, Mr. Mazeltov,
that's been my dream.

317
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,196
He's not the one you want.
I'm the one you want.

318
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,157
-l think he's the one we want.
-He's got a nice thing.

319
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:31,919
He's not bad with the singing and the
playing and the shaking of the tochis.

320
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:36,128
I think you've got what it takes
to make it in the big time.

321
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,166
The big time?

322
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:44,008
When the moon hits your eye
Like a big pizza pie

323
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,798
That's amore

324
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,971
When the world seems to shine

325
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,220
What the hell is this?

326
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,101
Pizza pie. What's in a pizza pie?

327
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,940
Bells will ring
Ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling

328
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,936
And you'll sing "Vita bella"

329
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,319
Hearts will play
Tippy-tippy-tay

330
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,487
Please, I can't anymore.

331
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,700
That's what l was gonna say.

332
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:13,708
-That's amore
-Amore

333
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,630
That is amore

334
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:24,929
All right. Hold, please. Stop that.
Stop your singing!

335
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,184
Stop your singing this instant,
young man!

336
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,636
I will not have this in my studio!

337
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,230
That's just a terrible, terrible...

338
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:36,563
...terrible, terrible "That's Amore."

339
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,147
Maybe it was a wrong song choice?

340
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:43,486
If you just let me play one of my songs,
I think you'll like it a whole lot better.

341
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:47,494
You have failed conclusively.
It's over.

342
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,491
And there is nothing
that you can do...

343
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,410
...here in this room
that can turn that around.

344
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,370
Nothing you can do that can make up
for what you did to "That's Amore."

345
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,669
-Well, my mother liked it a whole lot.
-Your mother was wrong.

346
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,463
I was willing to open my mind...

347
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,551
...because these Jewish gentlemen
brought you in here.

348
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,548
They usually have good taste.

349
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:11,305
And now here you are in front of me,
pretending you can sing.

350
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,643
And l have to say that today...

351
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:17,229
...your performance has shaken
my belief in the Jewish people.

352
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,606
Well, there's nothing
I would like more, sir...

353
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:23,533
...than to restore your faith in Judaism,
if you could just give me that shot.

354
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,864
But l'll tell you,
you have failed so far...

355
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,820
...and if somehow you are able
to sing a song now...

356
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,582
...bringing these boys together
you haven't even met...

357
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,332
...and make something
so personal, so new...

358
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,748
...that the whole world takes notice...

359
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,876
...and that your life
is never the same again....

360
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:45,551
But l'm telling you right now,
I don't think it's going to happen.

361
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:49,933
Wait, wait, wait. We're here already.
What could it possibly hurt?

362
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,434
L'Chaim, I'll do it for you.
But just one more song.

363
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,179
All right.

364
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,609
All right, son. I'm gonna
give you 1 5 more seconds.

365
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,611
Thank you, sir.
I hope you won't regret it.

366
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,112
Dewey, we don't know this song.

367
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,454
You just follow me.

368
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:13,788
I don't know.

369
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,683
Walk hard

370
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:35,468
Hard

371
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:36,891
Walk hard?

372
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:40,189
Down life's rocky road

373
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,941
Walk bold

374
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,605
Hard

375
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,821
That's my creed

376
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,569
My code

377
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:56,161
I been scorned and slandered
And ridiculed too

378
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,959
Had to struggle every day
My whole life through

379
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,502
Seen my share of the worst
That the world can give

380
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:11,177
But l still got a dream
And a burnin' rage to live

381
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,302
Walk hard

382
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,676
Hard

383
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,675
Here is America's new hit song
"Walk Hard"...

384
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:23,192
...recorded just 35 minutes ago
by Dewey Cox.

385
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:26,023
Hard

386
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,358
Though they say

387
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,317
You're not the one

388
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,868
Even if you've been told
Time and time again

389
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:39,406
That you're always gonna lose
And never gonna win

390
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,246
You gotta keep that vision
In your mind's eye

391
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:49,262
When you're standin' on top
Of a mountain high

392
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,638
He walks so hard.

393
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,268
How do l walk, boys?

394
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,771
Hard

395
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,902
When I meet my maker
On my dying day

396
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:14,025
I'm gonna look him in the eye
And by God, l'll say

397
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:18,906
I gave my word
And my word was good

398
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:23,117
l took it in the face
And l walked as hard as l could

399
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,250
Oh, hey, Shorty. Hello, my darling.

400
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,088
I sang a song at a circus
in New Jersey.

401
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,094
They said, "We'll give you 5 grand."

402
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,966
I said, "No, you won't.
You'll give me that giraffe."

403
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:37,926
-They did. They gave it right to me.
-That is one beautiful giraffe.

404
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,096
Thank you.

405
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,557
It'll just be a few weeks, Edith.

406
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,845
Who's gonna help me
take care of the children?

407
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,559
Dewey, you have got to
give up this dream.

408
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,860
You're never gonna make it.
Give it up, Dewey.

409
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:54,028
What are you talking about?
I got a number one hit on the radio.

410
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,446
I'm playing my music
for people who wanna hear me.

411
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,445
It's everything we always wanted,
Edith.

412
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,907
I never get to see you anymore.
Your kids never get to see you.

413
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,294
I don't know how to tell you this.

414
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,038
I'm gonna miss some things, okay?

415
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,708
I'm gonna miss some birthdays
and some christenings.

416
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,627
I'm gonna miss some births, period.

417
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,966
Unrealistic to think l'm gonna be
here every time you have a baby.

418
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:17,594
But aren't you happy?
You have a beautiful new home.

419
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,511
All your fancy new clothes
and your monkey and your giraffe.

420
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,891
Look, what else you need?

421
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:26,888
How about l get you
a crow that could talk?

422
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:30,515
And l'll teach him phrases that l say.
"Good morning, honey."

423
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:34,441
-But it'll be a little crow talking.
-This ain't about no exotic pets!

424
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,701
It's about love,
you stupid piece of shit.

425
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,034
-Dewey.
-Edith!

426
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,700
Don't you go in the bathroom.

427
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,869
Edith, please.

428
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,248
Mama said there's a lot of evil
on the road.

429
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,287
Temptations.

430
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,000
They'll make a man do evil things.

431
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:58,381
Edith, that is ridiculous.
Is that what this is all about?

432
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,802
There ain't no evil out there.

433
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,635
Come on, now, cupcake,
open the door.

434
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,140
Edith.

435
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:15,151
My beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful angel.

436
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,195
You know how much l love you.

437
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,825
You and this fast-growing family
of ours...

438
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:26,004
...is the only thing
that matters to me.

439
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:27,753
You understand that?

440
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:32,754
Heck, life without you
would be like no life at all.

441
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,300
Like no life at all.

442
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,259
Where's a pencil? Where's a pencil?

443
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,348
Dewey!

444
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,021
Hello, baby!

445
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,354
Yeah, this is
the Big Bopper speaking.

446
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:54,194
Oh, you sweet thing.

447
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,028
Do I what?

448
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,360
Will l what?

449
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:03,198
Oh, baby, you know what l like.

450
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:08,084
Chantilly lace and a pretty face
And a ponytail

451
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,206
How are we supposed to follow that?

452
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,214
Don't worry, Dewey, you'll do great.

453
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:15,206
-Thanks, Buddy Holly.
-lf you don't, l'll pick it back up.

454
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,549
-You got nothing to worry about.
-Oh, thank you.

455
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,974
I really like that "Walk Hard" song.

456
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,010
Oh, thanks.

457
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,387
I like that "Peggy Sue" song.
It's my favorite Buddy Holly song.

458
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:28,055
Thanks, Dewey.
I'm awful proud of that one.

459
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:30,265
Man, l'm awful nervous, Buddy Holly.

460
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,725
Dewey, you'll be fine,
or my name's not Buddy Holly.

461
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:37,227
Change of plans. Elvis wants
to get out of here early. He's hungry.

462
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:40,401
We'll change the order.
After the Big Bopper, it's Buddy Holly...

463
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,740
...then Elvis Presley,
and then you, Dewey Cox.

464
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:47,027
So it's the Big Bopper...

465
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,742
...and then Buddy Holly...

466
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:52,422
...and then Elvis Presley,
and then me?

467
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,922
Yeah. Just for tonight.

468
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:58,585
Well, l'm just happy to be here.

469
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,925
What am I doing?

470
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,354
I ain't good enough to follow Elvis.

471
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,013
What are you talking about, Dewey?

472
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:15,773
Nate. Nate, is that you?

473
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,899
You can do it, Dewey.
I know you can.

474
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:22,607
I know because I'm your brother,
and l believe in you.

475
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,109
But, hell, ain't nobody
can follow Elvis.

476
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,530
-Wait, did you say Elvis?
-Yeah.

477
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:31,542
Elvis Presley?
The King of Rock 'n' Roll?

478
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,115
Yeah, Elvis Presley.

479
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,330
He has nine number one hits.

480
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,960
Nate, l understand that.

481
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:38,957
He has 50 million fans.

482
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:41,629
I'm aware of that, Nate.
That's why I'm out here.

483
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,128
I'm having a crisis.

484
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,971
Holy shit.

485
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,683
Dewey! The big fella's on his
final encore. Are you ready?

486
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:54,481
Yeah. l'm ready.

487
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,570
Elvis!

488
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:06,609
Ladies.

489
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:09,662
Dang, Elvis Presley, you didn't
have to rile them up like that.

490
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,486
What, now?

491
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,583
-No, I'm--
-Excuse me, what?

492
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,917
I'm just saying,
we gotta follow that and--

493
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,922
Well, sometimes you have to go all out
when you're the King.

494
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,335
Because there's only one man
who's the King.

495
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,415
God picks him, hand-plucks him.

496
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:27,340
One night, God looked down at all the
millions and millions of people, man...

497
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,931
...and he decided which one
was the best, and it was me.

498
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:34,887
He plucked me from all those millions
and millions of people, man.

499
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,345
-Yeah.
-Listen to this, right now.

500
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:41,021
There's two things you need to know.
I'm the King. And number two is:

501
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:43,781
Look out, man! Look at that
coming at you. You see that?

502
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:46,534
It's called karate
and only two kinds of people know it.

503
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,856
The Chinese and the King.

504
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,532
And one of them is me.

505
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,740
You're the King.

506
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,580
On to Memphis, they want a nice little
honey and a little bit of June bug.

507
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,407
-Yeah?
-Yeah....

508
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,041
Come on, man....

509
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,546
Look out, man!

510
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,174
Well, thanks, Elvis.

511
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,471
Let's go. Come on, mama.

512
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,769
What the fuck was he talking about?

513
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,480
How y'all doing?
My name's Dewey Cox.

514
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:27,492
And, well, looks like l got some
proving myself to do.

515
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,067
Sam.

516
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,424
Walk hard

517
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,053
Hard

518
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:49,676
Down life's rocky road

519
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,770
Wow, great playing, boys.

520
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,515
The fillies love you, Dewey.

521
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:04,057
If l wasn't married with a good head on
my shoulders, l don't know what l'd do.

522
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,822
You gotta get back out there.
They are going crazy.

523
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,685
Let me splash some water
on my face.

524
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:10,492
Okay. Hurry up!

525
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,030
Golly, that rock 'n' roll.

526
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,747
-Get out of here, Dewey.
-What are y'all doing in here?

527
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:25,667
We're smoking reefer,
and you don't want no part of this shit.

528
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,247
You're smoking reefers?

529
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,212
Of course we are.
Can't you smell it?

530
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,376
No, Sam, l can't.

531
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,472
Come on, Dewey, join the party.

532
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:38,388
No, Dewey, you don't want this.
Get out of here!

533
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,268
I don't want no hangover.
I can't get no hangover.

534
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,556
It doesn't give you a hangover.

535
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,650
Will l get addicted to it
or something?

536
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,566
It's not habit-forming.

537
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:51,069
Oh, okay, well....

538
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:55,029
I don't know.
I don't wanna overdose on it.

539
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,450
You can't OD on it.

540
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,412
It's not gonna make me
wanna have sex, is it?

541
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,249
It makes sex even better.

542
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,498
Sounds kind of expensive.

543
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,747
It's the cheapest drug there is.

544
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,341
You don't want it.

545
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,796
I think I kind of want it.

546
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:15,049
Okay, but just this once.
Come on in.

547
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,719
-What do I do?
-Like this.

548
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,583
Oh, my.

549
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:42,963
Hey, listen, folks. l'd like to play
a song l wrote for a very special lady.

550
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:45,213
I'm talking about Mrs. Dewey Cox.

551
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:51,957
Oh, my darlin'

552
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:55,632
Yeah, yeah, yeah

553
00:34:55,844 --> 00:35:00,354
I have a perfect life

554
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:04,725
You are the perfect wife

555
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:08,904
I don't know why

556
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:13,485
I sit and cry

557
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:18,573
And now l miss you so

558
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:23,002
Please don't let me go

559
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:26,833
I make mistakes and that is true

560
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:31,707
At least I learn each time l do

561
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,920
Here, have some of this.

562
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,419
Darling, you must believe

563
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:41,392
I could never leave you
lf I tried

564
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:45,675
A life without you

565
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:53,612
ls no life at all

566
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,874
Oh, my darlin'

567
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:02,453
Yeah, yeah, yeah

568
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,539
Beth Anne.

569
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,214
Can l get that for you?

570
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,872
Thanks, Dewey.

571
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:12,673
Tears fall in vain

572
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:17,127
I'm standing in the rain

573
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,470
No matter how l feel

574
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:26,478
I never seem to know what's real

575
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:30,023
So sharpen up your knives

576
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,228
-Can l get that for you?
-Thanks, Dewey.

577
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:38,065
I'm a bad horse.

578
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:42,873
Phil, can I get that for you?

579
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:45,664
Thanks, Dewey.

580
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:47,869
Darling, you must believe

581
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,289
I could never leave you
lf I tried

582
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,838
Phil? What happened?

583
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,009
A life without you

584
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:06,524
ls no life at all

585
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,646
Well, the tour's going
real great, baby.

586
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,895
Yeah, we're having a real nice time.

587
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,187
Yeah, the boys have been
playing great...

588
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,951
...and the audiences have been
just wonderful, so....

589
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,454
-When you coming home?
-Soon, baby, real soon.

590
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,908
We gotta hit the major markets in
the Northeast, Chicago, Detroit--

591
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,868
Could you shut up? I'm trying to have
sex with these women down here.

592
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,540
Who's that?

593
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,674
Oh, that's Sam.

594
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:39,087
-He's just looking for his drumsticks.
-Howdy.

595
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,877
Excuse me.

596
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:47,009
Anyway, you don't wanna hear about
this boring stuff. How was your day?

597
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,891
Oh, you know,
just taking care of the kids.

598
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,479
Went down to Wilson's Market
the other day to pick up some milk.

599
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:56,566
Completely out of milk.
I had to go down to Peach Street.

600
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:59,443
-l hate going down there.
-Oh, brother. Can you believe it?

601
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:00,691
-Yes, Bert?
-Hey, Dewey.

602
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:03,112
-You want a cup of coffee?
-No, thank you.

603
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,661
Will you give me a minute?
I'm on the phone here.

604
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,777
-Who's that?
-That's Bert, my roadie.

605
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:11,082
Just wants to know if I want any coffee
or anything like that.

606
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:16,540
Dewey, there's a distance growing
between us, I feel, and l don't like it.

607
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,841
Oh, now, that is crazy talk, Edith.

608
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,585
You know
I'm just the same old Dewey.

609
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,507
-Hey, Dewey.
-Yes, Bert?

610
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,925
You seen my sandals?

611
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,800
I don't know.
I'm talking to my wife, Bert.

612
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,223
Baby, there's somebody at the door.
I gotta go.

613
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,062
Can l call when l get to New Jersey?

614
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,597
Okay. Bye, Dewey.

615
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:36,151
-I love you.
-All right.

616
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,524
-I love you.
-l love you.

617
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,150
-You're never gonna make it, okay?
-Okay, bye.

618
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:41,822
Bye.

619
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,120
-Pa.
-Dewey.

620
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,954
What are you doing here?

621
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,451
It's about your mama.

622
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,577
Ma? What about her? ls she okay?

623
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,962
We better step out into the hall.

624
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,181
-What happened?
-l'll tell you what happened.

625
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:12,307
We were readying for bed
when your song comes on the radio.

626
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,475
It's Dewey!

627
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,976
Your son is talented.
You should be proud.

628
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:23,193
Well, l must admit,
it is kind of catchy.

629
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,741
Dance with me, Pa.

630
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,831
It does make you kind of wanna move,
doesn't it?

631
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,373
It sure does.

632
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,331
Maybe I have been
kind of hard on little Dewey.

633
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,378
Maybe you have.

634
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,011
Be careful, Ma.

635
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:48,719
-You all right, Ma?
-l'm all right.

636
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:57,191
The vertigo, it won in the end.

637
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,645
She lost her balance...

638
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:02,191
...and fell out the window...

639
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,319
...and then the radio
crushed her head?

640
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,026
While she was dancing to your song.

641
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,026
I thought you should know
what your music does.

642
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,030
It kills people.

643
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:16,412
You made her happy
and it killed her.

644
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:20,791
If Nate was alive,
this never would have happened.

645
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:28,258
Wrong kid died.

646
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:34,177
Damn you, God!

647
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:40,186
How could you let my mama
fall out a window?

648
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,817
And then let a radio
hit her on the head?

649
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:51,701
-Get out of here, Dewey.
-What are y'all doing in here?

650
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:55,833
It's called cocaine,
and you don't want no part of this shit.

651
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,865
Cocaine?

652
00:40:58,831 --> 00:40:59,831
What's it do?

653
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,709
It turns all your bad feelings
into good feelings.

654
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,093
It's a nightmare.

655
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:09,505
I'm thinking maybe l'd like to try me
some of that cocaine.

656
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:14,547
When I meet my maker
On my dying day

657
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,432
Look him in the eye
And by God I'll say

658
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,439
I gave my word
And my word was good

659
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:25,654
l took it in the face
And l walked as hard as l could

660
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,937
Walk hard
Walk hard, hard, hard

661
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,951
Walk hard, hard, hard
Walk....

662
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,124
All right, again. Faster.

663
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:43,958
This is crazy, Dewey. Ain't nobody
gonna wanna listen to music like this.

664
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,286
Standing there
playing as fast as you can...

665
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,132
...singing like some sort of punk.

666
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,585
Don't you dare try to stifle me.

667
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,220
Whose band is this anyway,
you cocksucker!

668
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,849
I'll punch you in the mouth!

669
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,846
Oh, God. l'm sorry, Dave.

670
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,654
No, I didn't mean that.

671
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:11,145
Just with my mama dying and all,
I'm just all twisted up inside.

672
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,570
Mr. Cox?

673
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:18,289
I heard you were looking for a new
backup singer. For your new duet.

674
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:22,998
You heard right.

675
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,504
I was wondering if you might like
to give me a try.

676
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:28,876
I reckon I might.

677
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,183
I've been singing in my church choir
since I was a girl.

678
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:36,846
I like the sound of that.

679
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,524
Darlene Madison.

680
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,347
Dewey Cox.

681
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,395
Hello, Darlene.

682
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,901
Hello, Mr. Cox.

683
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,034
You ready to sing one?

684
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:56,316
I'm always ready.

685
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,031
Well, all right.

686
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:04,037
In my dreams you're blowin' me

687
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,706
Some kisses

688
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:12,709
That's one of my favorite things
To do

689
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:17,338
You and I could go down

690
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,011
In history

691
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:26,225
That's what I'm prayin' to do with you

692
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,479
Let's duet

693
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:33,025
In ways that make us feel good

694
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,239
Let's duet

695
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:39,569
And make that sacred sound

696
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,412
Dewey Cox!
I am not that kind of woman.

697
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,788
-All right.
-Well...

698
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,671
...that doesn't mean
that we still can't be friends.

699
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,126
Okay.

700
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,879
Well, then, here's to us
being great friends.

701
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,521
I can't! We're friends!

702
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,980
I'm gonna beat off

703
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,057
All my demons

704
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:17,238
That's what lovin' Jesus' all about

705
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:23,451
Lookin' in your eyes
I start believin'

706
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:30,708
Let's bring this whisper to a shout

707
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:32,957
Let's duet

708
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:37,469
In ways that make us feel good

709
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,140
Put two and two together

710
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:44,643
Perfect harmony we've found

711
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,889
We know it's only natural

712
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,650
Let's duet

713
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,399
I just wanna make out

714
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,317
What you're sayin'

715
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:03,117
Read my lips
It's what you're lookin' for

716
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:09,656
Here l am a-sneakin' up
Behind you

717
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:17,422
You can always come in
My back door

718
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,170
Let's duet

719
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:31,556
Darlene, these last three weeks
have been so...

720
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,019
...full and wonderful.

721
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:37,400
We've shared so many activities
together as good friends.

722
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:42,158
It's like you understand me
the way nobody else ever has.

723
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,281
I mean, if I--

724
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:54,583
-What is it, Dewey?
-l don't know.

725
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:56,711
It's nothing. l'm fine.

726
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,919
Nothing? You look like
you seen a ghost.

727
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:04,223
I got a lot of pain in me, Darlene.

728
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:06,394
You should know that.

729
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,892
Where does all that pain
come from, Dewey?

730
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:14,271
Did you ever have something
that you really loved...

731
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:18,154
...that you accidentally...

732
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:23,235
...killed, or hurt in some way,
with a machete?

733
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:25,565
-No.
-No, me neither.

734
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,241
-Wouldn't that be terrible?
-How would you live?

735
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,370
I know, right? Exactly.

736
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:38,747
Darling Darlene

737
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:42,051
I'm in love with you
I'm havin' fun with you

738
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,336
I'm in love with you
I'm on the run with you

739
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:50,681
I'm in love with you
And I'll be one with you one day

740
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,935
Thanks for letting me sleep
in your bunk, Dewey.

741
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,898
Gotta sleep somewhere, right?

742
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,406
-Dewey, l can't.
-l know. l know.

743
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:10,661
We both know that the sexual tension
between us is palpable.

744
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:14,455
Don't you know that l wrestle with
the same temptations you do?

745
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:17,133
I know l shouldn't be saying this
to you, Dewey...

746
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:20,133
...because we're not married
and we're just friends...

747
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:25,586
...but sometimes l lie awake at night
aching for a man's touch.

748
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:29,758
And by "a man's touch,"
I mean a penis in my vagina.

749
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,723
It's just so silly.

750
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,982
Oh, that's so silly.

751
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:38,154
-Well, we better get some sleep.
-Okay.

752
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:42,476
Take my hand, Dewey.

753
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:47,105
Let's promise to never, ever give in
to our lesser desires.

754
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:50,121
After all, we're not married.

755
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:00,504
I'm ready for sex.

756
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,799
I been waiting for this for so long.

757
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,182
Me too.

758
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:15,679
From the moment l laid eyes on you.

759
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,527
Oh, my.

760
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:35,326
Dewey, l'm nervous.

761
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:39,286
Don't worry, angel.
I'll show you the ways of love.

762
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,632
Whoops-a-daisy.

763
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,471
Oh, Dewey.

764
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,684
Surprise!

765
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,508
Edith!

766
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:56,563
-Who are you?
-l'm his wife, that's who l am.

767
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,975
No, you're not. l'm his--

768
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,147
-Good Lord, you're already married?
-l can explain.

769
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:07,395
Explain to her? You should explain to
me. l am the mother of your children.

770
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:09,739
-lt's not what it looks like.
-Children?

771
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,355
It's not what it looks like.

772
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:14,082
Not what it looks like to me,
or not what it looks like to her?

773
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:17,083
It's gotta be the way it looks like
to at least one of us.

774
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:18,366
We're married.

775
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,536
I did the right thing.
It's not like we're not married.

776
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:23,919
If you're married,
you can't get married again.

777
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:27,376
I know, I know, and that was wrong,
but it's just....

778
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,010
We were such good friends.

779
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:33,215
You told me about that dream
where you were licking my balls...

780
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:36,137
...and that seemed like a signal,
and....

781
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,430
I forgot.

782
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:41,941
I'm leaving you, Dewey Cox,
and l will see you in court!

783
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,274
No, Edith! Don't go!

784
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:48,935
Oh, well. She's gone now.

785
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:54,195
I'm leaving too. You got the order
of things all backwards.

786
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:56,236
Darlene, don't go!

787
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,160
Edith, don't go either!

788
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:03,790
I made a mistake.
I made a terrible mistake.

789
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:07,844
Edith! Edith! Edith!

790
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,625
-Leave me alone, Dewey.
-l never meant no harm to you.

791
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:13,129
Edith. Cupcake.

792
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:17,222
Baby, you don't know what it's like out
there on the road. lt's lonely out there.

793
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,313
Edith, l can't be alone.

794
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:22,935
Maybe you should've thought of that
before you got double married.

795
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,614
Is that what this is about?

796
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:29,443
Don't you stand there and judge me
like l'm some kind of criminal.

797
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,400
You are a criminal.
This is illegal, Dewey.

798
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,821
What do you mean?

799
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:37,529
It's illegal to be married to two people
at the same time, Dewey.

800
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:41,037
What about if you're famous?
Is that--?

801
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:43,833
You never done nothing
you shouldn't have done?

802
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,249
What have l ever done?

803
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:48,167
You woke up in the middle
of the night and drank the milk.

804
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:50,667
I got up to have my cornflakes,
there's none left.

805
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,339
Dewey, you cheated on me!

806
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:55,178
So l'm a cheater,
but you can just drink up all the milk.

807
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:58,724
Okay. All right, that's fine, l get it.
You're innocent, and I'm guilty.

808
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,019
Guilty as charged.

809
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,635
Guilty as charged

810
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:06,151
Don't you dare write a song
right now, Dewey!

811
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,360
You know what? Go ahead.
Take the children. l don't care.

812
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,441
All I need is my music.

813
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:13,901
I don't need you.

814
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:19,701
And l don't need you.

815
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,868
You're just sitting there,
all high and mighty in your diaper.

816
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:26,618
If anything, you need me.
You're a baby.

817
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:27,884
Come on, Miles.

818
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:31,125
Don't you dare take Miles.

819
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:35,376
You can take the children,
but you leave me my monkey.

820
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,394
Fine.

821
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:40,176
Goodbye, Dewey Cox.

822
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:42,391
No! No, come back.

823
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,561
Don't leave me, Edith.

824
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:48,646
"Don't leave me, Edith."
There's a title for a song.

825
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:56,567
That's not a bad title,
but please don't leave me.

826
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,364
What have you done?

827
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,749
I'm telling you, I've had it.
I've had it with all this crap.

828
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,247
You took her side every time.

829
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:13,919
All you care about is fruit
and touching yourself. Well, fuck you.

830
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,676
Get out of here.
You don't want no part of this.

831
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:21,393
-What y'all doing in here?
-We doing pills, uppers and downers.

832
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,345
They're the logical next step for you.

833
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:25,215
I want some of that shit.

834
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:31,059
Good morning, Your Honor.
May I approach the bench?

835
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:39,525
I don't give a damn
What anyone thinks

836
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:45,504
I stay up all night
And l smoke and l drink

837
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:50,671
I'm a wanted man
And l'm blowin' town

838
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,754
Don't waste your time
Tryin' to hunt me down

839
00:52:55,797 --> 00:53:00,467
The cops are sayin'
I belong behind bars

840
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,596
And I'm guilty

841
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:04,813
Guilty

842
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,060
I'm guilty as charged

843
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,024
Does Dewey seem unhappy to you?

844
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,150
He's changed, I tell you,
he's changed.

845
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,987
That was early Dewey,
this is middle Dewey.

846
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,446
Dewey, are you enjoying yourself?

847
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:25,445
What? Oh, l'm sorry.
I forgot you were here.

848
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,949
Hey, Dave. l like your girl better,
let's switch.

849
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,960
-Well, Dewey, this is my wife.
-Oh, nice to meet you.

850
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,245
Well, this is Kathy.
Kathy, this is Dave.

851
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:37,129
Come on, darling.
So where you from?

852
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:40,928
Hi there.

853
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:42,973
Guilty

854
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,846
I'm guilty as charged

855
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:50,062
I ain't askin' God to forgive my sins

856
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:52,937
Take a good look
And you'll know where I've been

857
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:55,815
I'm dancin' with the devil
Every night and every day

858
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:59,238
People pay attention to the things
That l say

859
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:00,443
Say

860
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:04,029
Hey, Jerry, l'm a long-time listener
and a first-time caller.

861
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:07,739
Yeah, l just wanted to say
I love the show, keep it up.

862
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,701
Am l on the radio right now?

863
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,865
I'm guilty as charged

864
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:18,749
If you're sayin' my love is too large

865
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,052
Then I'm guilty

866
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:25,300
Goddamn it,
this is a dark fucking period!

867
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:27,597
Oh, l'm guilty

868
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:30,894
-Freeze! Hands above your head.
-lt's not what it looks like.

869
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,229
I'm guilty as charged

870
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,435
Stop!

871
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:36,652
You got me.

872
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:39,685
Come on, Mr. Cox. How about it?
Look here.

873
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:47,530
I'm guilty as charged

874
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:59,133
Cox, you got a visitor.

875
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,878
Prison has changed me.

876
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:07,433
I understand the common man
in a way l never did before.

877
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:13,309
I gotta get out of here, so l can
bring joy to the men back in here.

878
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:15,807
But l don't wanna live with them.

879
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,728
Lean closer.

880
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:22,071
I'm going to speak to you
in my language...

881
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:25,947
...so that the guards can't understand
what I'm saying.

882
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,413
There must be something you can do.

883
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:32,541
I'm 21 years old.

884
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:34,458
I got my whole life ahead of me....

885
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:38,293
We think we can get you off.

886
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:39,844
What do I have to do?

887
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:42,838
You gotta go to rehab.

888
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,300
-"Rehab"?
-Rehab.

889
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:51,506
-Rehab?
-Oh, rehab. Okay, okay, I gotcha.

890
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,853
Doctor! Doctor!

891
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,310
-l'm so cold.
-We need more blankets.

892
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,071
We need more blankets.

893
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,438
Doctor!

894
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,530
-l'm so hot!
-l think he has too many blankets.

895
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:07,737
Fewer blankets!

896
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,700
I'm hot and cold at the same time!

897
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,787
He needs more blankets
and he needs less blankets.

898
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:15,714
I'm afraid you're right.

899
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,122
Dewey?

900
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:19,576
My wife sends her love...

901
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,041
...asshole.

902
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:25,801
Dewey, tall and powerful

903
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:30,682
Dewey, l don't know if you can
hear me in there...

904
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,724
...but the wrong kid died.

905
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:39,225
Dewey. Do you mind
if we get stoned in here?

906
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:42,936
He can't hear you.
He's gonna die anyway.

907
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:04,248
Are you ready to go home,
Dewey Cox?

908
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,167
Darlene.

909
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:09,796
I could never get you
out of my head.

910
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,763
Me neither.

911
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,221
I could never stop
thinking about you.

912
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:20,192
But l wasn't gonna be
no home wrecker.

913
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:24,823
Now that l'm your only wife though,
it seems different.

914
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:29,903
I'm a new man, Darlene.
Prison and rehab have changed me.

915
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:33,158
All these blankets
have saved my life.

916
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:37,236
I think you're finally ready to be the
man l always thought you could be.

917
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:18,914
Let me get this off.

918
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,337
I love you.

919
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,634
I love you too.

920
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:41,809
Oh, my God.

921
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,989
Oh, don't stop.

922
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:55,533
Don't stop. Don't stop, Dewey.

923
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:57,239
Oh, God.

924
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,827
Oh, yes!

925
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,594
Hey, boys, have you seen Dewey?

926
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:17,339
I think I saw him in the barn
with Wavy Gravy

927
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,392
I saw him by the creek
talking to Donovan.

928
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:23,176
No, I think he was painting
a portrait with Joni Mitchell.

929
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:30,857
Jerry Garcia, brother,
have you seen Dewey?

930
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:33,396
I think I saw him in the study,
Sister Darlene.

931
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,280
Thanks, Jerry Garcia.

932
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:40,413
Hey! Casey, Jones,
watch your speed.

933
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:49,125
Come on, Dewey. It's almost time
for Dewman's cake.

934
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:53,844
All right. lt's just-- lt's hard for me
to sit around at some birthday party...

935
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:57,087
...when I know there's so much
injustice going on in this world.

936
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,390
-l know.
-My daddy was right.

937
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:02,354
I can't spend all my time
thinking about Dewey Cox no more.

938
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:04,345
I've got to think about
the other people.

939
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:05,848
Like your family?

940
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:11,323
No, I mean, like, people that's having
injustices done to them.

941
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,780
Like women and midgets and such.

942
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:17,493
I mean, it's 1 966, Darlene.
And, baby...

943
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,367
...l'm feeling it.

944
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:26,206
I know. The '60s are an important
and exciting time.

945
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:29,713
Aren't they? It's like there's
something happening here.

946
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:33,546
And what it is ain't exactly...

947
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:36,223
...obvious.

948
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:39,053
I have to try to help people
with my music.

949
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:43,349
Some people are saying that your new
music sounds a lot like Bob Dylan.

950
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:45,515
Well, maybe Bob Dylan
sounds a lot like me.

951
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:47,434
How come nobody
ever asks Bob Dylan:

952
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,562
"Why you sound
so much like Dewey Cox?"

953
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,729
Mailboxes drip like lampposts

954
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:55,228
In the twisted birth canal
Of the coliseum

955
01:00:57,404 --> 01:01:01,374
Rimjob fairy teapots
Mask the temper tantrum

956
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:03,703
Oh, say can you see 'em?

957
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:08,714
Stuffed cabbage is the darling
Of the Laundromat

958
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:13,592
The mouse with the overbite exрlained
How the rabbits were ensnared

959
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,210
What the hell is this song about?

960
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:18,011
I have no idea.

961
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:22,514
You guys are idiots.
This song is very deep.

962
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:29,099
Inside the three-eyed monkey
Within inches of his toaster-oven life

963
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:31,729
What do your parents think about
your protest songs?

964
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:35,266
What do your parents think about my
protest songs, Mr. TIME Magazine?

965
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,280
All the elevator buttons

966
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:44,276
So incredibly high

967
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:47,491
I stand today for the midget

968
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:51,786
Half the size of a regular guy

969
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:56,299
Let me hold you, little man

970
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:59,513
As the parade passes by

971
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:03,510
Let me hold you, little man

972
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:07,354
We'll make believe you can fly

973
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:09,305
You shout for me to put you down

974
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:14,902
But I'm marching today
For your cause

975
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:18,944
I'm banging the drum
Your big day will come

976
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,740
When they remake The Wizard of Oz

977
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:28,493
So let me hold you, midget man

978
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:32,330
Pretend that you're flying in space

979
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:36,169
Let me hold you, midget man

980
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:39,166
So the dog will stop licking your face

981
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,666
Sing with me!

982
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,506
Sing it!

983
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:46,677
Mr. Cox, why are you going to lndia?

984
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:50,806
Well, l'm searching for something,
if you must know.

985
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:53,475
I'm fixing to do some meditating
with the maharishi.

986
01:02:53,645 --> 01:02:56,145
And Dewey Cox needs lndia
right now...

987
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:59,364
...and, heck, l reckon lndia
needs Dewey Cox too.

988
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:06,744
Only through meditation can we
begin to understand our role.

989
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:11,040
We're nothing but grains of sand.

990
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,624
That was freaking transcendental,
Paul McCartney.

991
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:16,210
-Don't you agree, John Lennon?
-Yes, Dewey Cox.

992
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:19,753
With meditation there's no limit
to what we can...

993
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,341
...imagine.

994
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,336
What do you think, George Harrison?

995
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:27,218
I don't know. l'm just trying to get
some more songs on the album.

996
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:30,717
And as Ringo Starr,
I'm not so interested in meditation.

997
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,980
I just like to have fun.

998
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,560
-l like the little one.
-lt's so dark in this tent.

999
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:40,229
Reminds me when we, the Beatles,
the four Beatles, us--

1000
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,570
-From Liverpool.
-Yes, we are from Liverpool.

1001
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:46,735
We used to play those dark clubs
in Hamburg. Remember that, Paul?

1002
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:51,236
Of course I do, l booked them.
I'm the leader of the Beatles.

1003
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:54,451
Well, l have to say l like your stuff.
It's pretty good.

1004
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,922
And most of your records,
I really enjoy.

1005
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,043
We're big fans of your records too.

1006
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:02,250
We like to think that Hard Day's Night
is our Guilty as Charged.

1007
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:04,422
-Great record.
-Excellent album.

1008
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:06,591
-We learned a lot from you.
-Great record.

1009
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:08,429
-We're big fans of y'all.
-Huge fans.

1010
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:11,255
You're almost as good as
the Monkees. You guys are great.

1011
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:16,435
I think I might adjourn to another
dimension, take some LSD.

1012
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:19,023
-Do you care to join me?
-Yeah, let's do that.

1013
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:21,688
Care to join us for some LSD?
It's good for you.

1014
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:25,278
-Built by scientists, it is.
-Lysergic.

1015
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,532
Gotta check with headquarters.

1016
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,947
Come on, Dewey Cox.
Think you might enjoy it.

1017
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:33,616
Open your mind to a new experience,
a new level of consciousness...

1018
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:35,696
...like we do,
because we are the Beatles.

1019
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,582
Let him decide.
If he wants to take LSD, he'll take it.

1020
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,960
He doesn't have to listen to you.
You're not the boss of him.

1021
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,747
Don't tell me what to say
and what not to say, Paul McCartney.

1022
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:48,302
I'm sick of you being so dark when l'm
so impish and whimsical. I'm sick of it.

1023
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:51,678
Hey, everyone,
I've got a brand-new mantra:

1024
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:53,466
Paul's a big fat cunt.

1025
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,970
Don't know why you
don't let me write more songs.

1026
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:59,602
You know, I just sit here while me
guitar quietly whimpers, you know.

1027
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:02,401
You are the quiet one,
so why don't you shut the fuck up?

1028
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,315
I've got a song about an octopus.

1029
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:07,444
Jam it up your ass. You're lucky
we still let you play drums.

1030
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:11,412
Wow, seems like there's a rift
happening between the Beatles.

1031
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:14,624
I wonder if your songs will
still be shit when I'm 64.

1032
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:16,236
-Great sod.
-No, stop it!

1033
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:17,792
You bastard! You sissy.

1034
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:21,246
Beatles. Please stop fighting
here in India.

1035
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,457
No, no, let them go.
Let them work it out.

1036
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:24,668
Taste it.

1037
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,457
Right there in the bollocks.

1038
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:29,165
-Bastard!
-Cunt!

1039
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:32,839
Dewey, you been living clean
for three years now...

1040
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:35,262
...and it's done you a world of good,
has it not?

1041
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,561
I know l've had trouble
with drugs in the past.

1042
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:42,345
But l'm addicted to coke, weed, booze,
ludes and speed. Not LSD.

1043
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:44,902
Nobody gets addicted to LSD.

1044
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,936
It was invented by scientists.
Ringo Starr just told me.

1045
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:50,951
I heard that doing LSD
can awaken your demons.

1046
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:55,082
I ain't got no demons
gonna get woke.

1047
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:59,788
If you promise
it'll just be this one time.

1048
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,423
Okay.

1049
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,380
Let's go drop acid with the Beatles.

1050
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,061
Hello, Dewey.

1051
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,984
Welcome to your LSD trip.

1052
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:23,484
Where everything's a cartoon.

1053
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:26,226
We're the trippy cartoon Beatles.

1054
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:29,029
Look at that. It's a flying fish.

1055
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:30,903
Totally trippy!

1056
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:34,605
Wow, this LSD's all right.

1057
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:36,912
I like being a trippy cartoon.

1058
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:39,696
Just keep thinking
happy thoughts, Dewey.

1059
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:43,041
I'd hate for this
to turn into a bad trip.

1060
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:46,633
What's that scary music?

1061
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:49,964
I had an unhappy thought.

1062
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:51,591
It's a bad trip.

1063
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:53,298
Bad trip, bad trip!

1064
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:56,428
Help! Trippy machete!

1065
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:00,603
Oh, fuck me.
I can see my large colon.

1066
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,729
I guess I do have some demons.

1067
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:05,435
You all right, Cox?

1068
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:06,895
I don't know.

1069
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:09,515
Do you want some more LSD?

1070
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:12,572
Yeah. l think l do.

1071
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:22,657
Mr. Schwartzberg, you're his long-time
manager. Maybe you can talk to him.

1072
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:24,580
Well, what's the problem?

1073
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,329
He's been on that trampoline
for four days.

1074
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:30,592
You have got to talk some sense
into him. l'm worried.

1075
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:36,548
Dewey, as your manager,
I have to tell you l'm concerned.

1076
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,929
I think the LSD has changed you.

1077
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:42,677
It has changed me.
It's opened my mind right up.

1078
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,350
I'm reinventing music.

1079
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:47,649
I'm creating something new
that I call "shmusic."

1080
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:51,324
You've recorded the same song for
months. You're not close to finished.

1081
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:54,154
Because this record is different
than any other l've made.

1082
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,820
I told you. This is going to be
my masterpiece.

1083
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:59,239
The one l'm remembered by.
It's for my brother.

1084
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:00,582
What brother?

1085
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:03,201
Nothing. Never mind. lt's private.

1086
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:06,211
I've got this sound in my head
and it's trying to get out.

1087
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:09,964
I can't find it on this human plane of
existence. l've got to keep searching.

1088
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:14,755
But l'll tell you what,
I'm gonna find it.

1089
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:25,517
You guys should make friends.
He's a wonderful man.

1090
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:29,185
Professor, good morning.
All right, everyone. Thank you.

1091
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:31,725
I've just been outside,
I had a little bounce.

1092
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:34,939
What we're going to do is
run through the entire piece...

1093
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,071
...in our minds, silently.

1094
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:39,238
And...

1095
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:40,737
...begin.

1096
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:43,619
As we sit here together
on Thanksgiving...

1097
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,576
...on our beautiful trampoline...

1098
01:08:45,746 --> 01:08:49,916
...l think we should take a moment to
think about what it's like to be a turkey.

1099
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:52,956
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

1100
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,009
"Hi, l'm just a little turkey."

1101
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:57,763
Just cut the damn bird, boy.

1102
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:02,261
Dewey? Can we just enjoy
our Thanksgiving dinner?

1103
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:07,060
You think you're so great
sitting there all drugged up...

1104
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:09,056
...on your trampoline.

1105
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:11,438
You're the black sheep
of this family.

1106
01:09:11,772 --> 01:09:13,652
You call yourself a Cox.

1107
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,776
Until you get right with Jesus...

1108
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:19,953
...you'll never be nothing
but a big, black Cox.

1109
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:25,622
Nothing l do will ever please you,
will it?

1110
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:30,000
We're both Cox, Pa.
Both of us are Cox.

1111
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:33,626
I've got 1 37 musicians
waiting on me.

1112
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:35,804
You'll have to excuse me.

1113
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:37,835
Dewey, watch the turkey.

1114
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,637
I wasn't dreaming

1115
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:48,477
Barely awake

1116
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:52,483
Off to the grinder we stroll

1117
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:55,193
This is not a good song.

1118
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:58,898
It's like five songs on top
of each other at the same time.

1119
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:01,820
Not even a song.
It's some kind of concerto.

1120
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:03,321
Just let him work it out.

1121
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:06,025
Masterpieces take time.

1122
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,293
Do you hear that?
That goat's been singing...

1123
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,865
...more than l am on this damn song.

1124
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:18,591
Well?

1125
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:21,586
That was beautiful, Dewey.
It was perfection.

1126
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:24,389
Yeah, even the goat was perfect.

1127
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:27,143
Yeah, the goat was good.
Were the strings tangy enough?

1128
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:29,346
Oh, they were tangy.
They were very tangy.

1129
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:31,227
Unbelievably tangy.

1130
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:34,404
No, guys, the strings were not tangy!
They were salty!

1131
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,153
Am l crazy?

1132
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:38,855
Let's do one more time.
Okay, strings, lean into it.

1133
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:41,896
I want it really tangy this time.
Now, Mike, you're flatting.

1134
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:46,121
Bushmen, make it sound like
you're in the fucking bush, okay?

1135
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:48,414
Back off the goat
on the second pre-chorus.

1136
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,367
I wanna hear his heart, not his soul.

1137
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:53,458
Sam, go back to that thing you did
yesterday on the bridge.

1138
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:56,924
-What did l do?
-lt sounded like velvet pancakes.

1139
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:59,796
-Yeah, right.
-Okay, everybody, one more time.

1140
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:02,264
What on earth is a velvet pancake?

1141
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:07,215
It's the LSD.
I think it's having an effect on him.

1142
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:10,308
From the top of the overture.
Slate it.

1143
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:13,771
"Black Sheep," take 1 1 2.

1144
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:17,056
One, and a two,
and a five, six, seven, eight.

1145
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:22,735
I just close my eyes
When I fantasize

1146
01:11:22,903 --> 01:11:26,163
Much to my surprise
I'm only half the size

1147
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:28,244
That l used to be

1148
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:33,409
Bye-bye, white brother

1149
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:37,251
This black sheep gotta roll

1150
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:39,588
It's on the beat!

1151
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:42,798
I just oрen up
Like a catacomb

1152
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:46,835
Though my heart is half
From the half-F tone

1153
01:11:47,595 --> 01:11:49,545
That tickles.

1154
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:54,931
Bye-bye, рastures of plenty

1155
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:58,766
I don't know where l will

1156
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:01,609
-Roam
-Black sheep, black sheep

1157
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,321
Like that, with some urgency.

1158
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:07,947
Not, "l'm in the yard.
I wanna go outside."

1159
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:12,615
Like, "l'm about to die." Like that.

1160
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:14,537
The blade has been swung

1161
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:17,495
Black sheep, black sheep

1162
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:21,537
All right? Here we go.

1163
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:25,220
Push. Push, baby, push.

1164
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:27,184
-Are we recording this?
-No.

1165
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:30,643
Well, we should be. Get a microphone.
Push, baby.

1166
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:32,215
Push.

1167
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:34,520
Push! Push!

1168
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:39,690
I'm losin' my fleece from tryin'

1169
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:43,185
I'm losin' no sleep
I'm dyin'

1170
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:47,571
Why shouldn't I keep from cryin'?

1171
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:50,452
Cryin'

1172
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:53,946
I'm losin' my fleece from tryin'

1173
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:57,500
I'm losin' no sleep
I'm dyin'

1174
01:12:57,665 --> 01:13:00,995
Why shouldn't I keep from cry--?

1175
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,302
It's still not finished yet.

1176
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:12,506
I'm hearing more
aboriginal percussionists.

1177
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:17,345
And l want an army of didgeridoos.
Fifty thousand didgeridoos!

1178
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:19,598
Folks, can we have a moment
with Dewey?

1179
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:24,900
What the hell are these songs about?

1180
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:27,397
You're singing about
cutting people in half--

1181
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:32,526
I'm working something out.
It's called a metaphor.

1182
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,160
Well, what are you working out?

1183
01:13:34,326 --> 01:13:36,656
It's secret.
That's why it's called metaphor.

1184
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,579
That's what metaphor means. Secret.

1185
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:41,881
I just don't see why you gotta
throw away the recipe, is all.

1186
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:43,542
Why don't we just go in there...

1187
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:46,211
...lay down some tracks
like we always done?

1188
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,970
Yeah, why can't we just walk hard?

1189
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:51,013
What do we need
all these people for?

1190
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:54,797
I don't need people around me
stifling me.

1191
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:58,352
So if you don't like it,
there's the door.

1192
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,060
Dewey?

1193
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,980
Are you saying
you don't need us no more?

1194
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:09,898
Not unless you can open your mind
and learn to play the fucking theremin.

1195
01:14:12,072 --> 01:14:13,872
Fuck you, Dewey!

1196
01:14:14,366 --> 01:14:16,656
Yeah, fuck you, Dewey.

1197
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:19,407
In 20 years, not once have you
thrown a woman my way.

1198
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,960
You don't think we like
cheating on our wives too?

1199
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:25,174
And you never once paid for drugs.
Not once!

1200
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:28,336
You pay that chimp
more than you pay us.

1201
01:14:28,505 --> 01:14:31,375
I had to borrow from the chimp
to get a mortgage on my house.

1202
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:35,760
And those stupid Siamese glass cats
you get us every year for Christmas.

1203
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:38,810
I don't want any more
Siamese glass cats!

1204
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:42,024
The Siamese cat is a symbol
of nobility in ancient Egypt.

1205
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:43,226
Fuck nobility!

1206
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:45,265
Fuck ancient Egypt.

1207
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:47,193
Fuck cats!

1208
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:49,858
And you never paid for drugs.

1209
01:14:50,194 --> 01:14:51,574
Not once.

1210
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:53,397
You slept with my wife.

1211
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:54,782
You slept with me too!

1212
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:58,239
And l've had confused feelings
about that for 1 0 years now.

1213
01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:00,830
And you never once paid for drugs.

1214
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:03,206
Not once.

1215
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:05,544
You're on your own, Dewey Cox.

1216
01:15:06,126 --> 01:15:07,286
We're leaving.

1217
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:13,968
Well, l guess this is the end of
a chapter in your life, Dewey Cox.

1218
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:30,321
What's happened to you,
Dewey Cox?

1219
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:31,824
Stay out of this, Darlene!

1220
01:15:31,986 --> 01:15:34,486
You're driving away the people
who love you most!

1221
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:36,735
I don't need anybody, Darlene.

1222
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:38,994
All I need is my music.

1223
01:15:39,743 --> 01:15:44,333
This ain't about your music, Dewey.
It's about the drugs.

1224
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:47,248
Honey, l told you
I'm gonna quit again.

1225
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:49,746
As soon as the record's done.
Whenever that is.

1226
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,670
Look, you can't rush a masterpiece.

1227
01:15:55,175 --> 01:15:58,425
You need to take a break. You need
to clean yourself up, otherwise--

1228
01:15:58,595 --> 01:15:59,845
Otherwise what?

1229
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:02,524
Otherwise I can't be married
to you no more.

1230
01:16:04,184 --> 01:16:05,444
I know you don't mean that.

1231
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:08,150
I believe you know that l do.

1232
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,650
Okay.

1233
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:18,531
-Okay?
-Okay.

1234
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:20,701
You'll take a break?

1235
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:22,986
I will take a break.

1236
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:24,830
And you'll quit the drugs?

1237
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:27,576
And l will quit the drugs.

1238
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:29,877
Dewey!

1239
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:35,264
Oh, baby. I've been praying
about this day for so long.

1240
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:38,263
-What did you just put in your mouth?
-Gum.

1241
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:42,217
-You ain't chewing no gum.
-Candy?

1242
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:45,309
-What did you put in your mouth?
-lt's PCP.

1243
01:16:45,476 --> 01:16:47,726
Oh, you just said--!

1244
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:52,981
I'm going to town!

1245
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:01,033
Get out of the road, you jerk!

1246
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:17,590
There he is!

1247
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:27,023
Dewey! Get off that building!
It's inappropriate!

1248
01:17:29,436 --> 01:17:33,766
Dewey Cox, you give me no choice.

1249
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:38,861
It breaks my heart,
but I'm leaving you.

1250
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:40,319
I'm Zeus!

1251
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:45,873
No mortal can stop me! I'm Zeus!

1252
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:52,003
-Rehab?
-Rehab.

1253
01:18:02,052 --> 01:18:03,092
Nate!

1254
01:18:07,141 --> 01:18:08,771
Nate?

1255
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:11,144
This is what l'd look like
if l'd grown up...

1256
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:14,015
...and perhaps hadn't been murdered,
or whatever.

1257
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:18,031
I just came to tell you
you need to get your shit together!

1258
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:19,743
I know.

1259
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:21,403
I've fallen again.

1260
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:23,912
Listen to yourself.
Whining like a little bitch.

1261
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:27,834
If l was alive right now, l'd be the
fucking president of the United States.

1262
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:31,115
I'd be on the moon, walking around
looking for aliens to kill.

1263
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:34,000
-What?
-You know why Dad liked me better?

1264
01:18:34,168 --> 01:18:35,998
Because I was better than you.

1265
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:38,500
When I played the piano,
I was fucking awesome.

1266
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:40,672
Well, you think
it's been easy for me?

1267
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:42,841
Since you're gone,
I got no sense of smell.

1268
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:44,720
Oh, you got no sense of smell?

1269
01:18:45,596 --> 01:18:49,056
You can't smell anything?
You can't smell anything?

1270
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:51,684
I got no sense of having legs,
Dewey!

1271
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:55,152
I have no life!
I'm dead because somebody--

1272
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:57,364
I'm not gonna point out
names right now.

1273
01:18:57,524 --> 01:18:59,444
--decided to murder me
with a machete.

1274
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:02,360
-Nate.
-l can't even smell, touch, feel.

1275
01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:06,489
I can't even masturbate. You ever try
to jerk off with a ghost hand? Nothing!

1276
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:11,122
I'm just trying to say
you need to fix this shit.

1277
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:14,578
You need to get out of that bathtub.
Start writing songs again.

1278
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:22,050
Is he almost done
thinking about his life?

1279
01:19:22,216 --> 01:19:24,926
He just reached the '70s.

1280
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:46,857
Schwartzy, l don't know. l don't know.
I don't know what's going on with me.

1281
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:48,322
I got the song block.

1282
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:49,582
Song block.

1283
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:51,743
I don't need to write any new songs.

1284
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:55,412
I'll just do my old ones. We'll do
a oldies tour. I'll do "Walk Hard."

1285
01:19:55,582 --> 01:19:58,422
Dewey, "Walk Hard"
is over 20 years old.

1286
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:00,915
Well, a lot of people like
my old songs.

1287
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:02,958
Old people like your old songs.

1288
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:04,760
May I make a suggestion?

1289
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:06,965
Are you familiar with
the Donny & Marie show?

1290
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:10,385
-The television show?
-l got a call from CBS.

1291
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:13,176
They wanna do the same kind
of show with you.

1292
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:16,850
I'm a serious musician.
I'm not some TV personality.

1293
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:20,440
Well, why can't you be both? Look
at those goofy bastards on Hee Haw.

1294
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:22,361
Well, l do love Hee Haw.

1295
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:25,696
Television, Dewey. lt's the way
into the people's hearts.

1296
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:29,370
All right. You call them back today...

1297
01:20:29,533 --> 01:20:31,953
...and you tell Mr. CBS...

1298
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:35,709
...that l will do it if I have
total creative control.

1299
01:20:35,872 --> 01:20:38,462
Dewey, you can't have
any creative control.

1300
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:41,457
Okay.

1301
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:44,628
All right, let's just do it then.
Fuck it, let's do it.

1302
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:46,173
I'm bored.

1303
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:50,139
Live from Burbank, California.

1304
01:20:50,304 --> 01:20:52,264
It's The Dewey Cox Show.

1305
01:20:52,889 --> 01:20:57,519
And now your host, Dewey Cox!

1306
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,806
-Walk hard
-Hard

1307
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:01,560
-Hard
-Hard

1308
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:04,862
Down life's rocky road

1309
01:21:05,485 --> 01:21:07,645
-Walk bold
-Bold

1310
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:09,201
-Hard
-Hard

1311
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:11,374
That's my creed

1312
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:13,413
My code

1313
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:15,657
I been scorned and slandered
And ridiculed too

1314
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:19,537
Had to suffer every day
My whole life through

1315
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:23,539
Seen my share of the worst
That the world can give

1316
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:28,672
But l still got a dream
And a burnin' rage to live

1317
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:34,181
Walk hard

1318
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:38,558
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the show.

1319
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:40,017
We've got a great one.

1320
01:21:40,187 --> 01:21:43,017
To get things rolling,
I'd like to bring out my first guest...

1321
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:47,610
...a model l think is pretty super:
Miss Cheryl Tiegs.

1322
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:53,948
Well, hello, Cheryl.
Don't you look lovely tonight.

1323
01:21:54,117 --> 01:21:56,197
Well, thanks so much, sir.
So do you.

1324
01:21:56,370 --> 01:22:00,620
Cheryl, you know, you remind me
of a 1 977 Corvette.

1325
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:01,961
Why is that?

1326
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:04,035
Because you're
a beautiful new model.

1327
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:08,964
Just kidding.

1328
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:16,426
Would you do me the honor
ofjoining me for a song?

1329
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:19,268
Well, l thought you'd never ask,
Mr. Cox.

1330
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:25,725
Baby, come as you are
With just your heart

1331
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:28,981
And I'll take you in

1332
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:32,066
You're rejected and hurt

1333
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:37,409
To me you're worth
What you have within

1334
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:41,371
You don't have to be a star, baby

1335
01:22:42,249 --> 01:22:44,749
To be in my show

1336
01:22:45,585 --> 01:22:48,875
Good night, everybody.
We'll see you next week.

1337
01:22:54,177 --> 01:22:55,717
Good show.

1338
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:01,523
-You ready, Dewey?
-Yes, I'm ready.

1339
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:06,725
"Who Wants to Party?"
Dewey, lead vocal, take one.

1340
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:17,905
Hey, hey
Who wants to party?

1341
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:22,456
Hey, hey
Who wants to party now?

1342
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:26,959
I don't know. l'll see you in a minute.

1343
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:30,127
All right. Everybody good?
Everybody good?

1344
01:23:30,297 --> 01:23:32,167
Whoa, Dewey.
Great party, great party.

1345
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:35,680
Thanks, Patrick Duffy from Dallas.
Listen, mingle, enjoy yourself.

1346
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:38,804
-Have sex with anybody you want.
-Well, can do.

1347
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:40,392
-Hey!
-Dewey!

1348
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:44,637
Oh, my God, your show is such a hit.
You beat McCloud last week.

1349
01:23:44,811 --> 01:23:48,441
Well, thank you, Morgan Fairchild,
but I never pay attention to the ratings.

1350
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:51,317
Just kidding. We're gonna
take a shit on Donnie & Marie.

1351
01:23:51,485 --> 01:23:53,065
-Oh, you do that, honey.
-Yes.

1352
01:23:53,236 --> 01:23:57,026
Hey, you. Are you gonna
save a dance for me, Dewey?

1353
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:59,699
Well, you bet,
Cheryl Ladd from Charlie's Angels.

1354
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,828
Hey there, Little Miss Cox-Tiegs.

1355
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:03,995
Have you met my new wife,
Cheryl Cox-Tiegs?

1356
01:24:04,164 --> 01:24:06,214
We've met, yes.

1357
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:08,634
Isn't that funny?
You're both named Cheryl.

1358
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:11,054
Yeah. We're aware of that.

1359
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:13,837
That is hilarious.

1360
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:17,510
Hey, hey
Who wants to party?

1361
01:24:17,677 --> 01:24:20,007
I don't know what they're
talking about with this energy crisis.

1362
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:23,520
Because I have plenty of energy,
all right? l am loaded with energy.

1363
01:24:25,519 --> 01:24:28,099
Look, l gave up politics
a long time ago.

1364
01:24:28,271 --> 01:24:31,731
You know, let somebody else march.
I wanna play Frisbee.

1365
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:35,364
I'm on the beach.
I'm not marching on the beach.

1366
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:37,859
Billy, don't be a hero

1367
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:41,031
Don't be a fool with your life

1368
01:24:44,204 --> 01:24:46,214
Do me, Dewey.

1369
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:53,880
I can't, Cheryl Ladd,
I'm married to Cheryl Tiegs.

1370
01:24:54,047 --> 01:24:57,127
Oh, l should've been your guest star
last week instead of her.

1371
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:59,720
It could've been me.

1372
01:25:00,136 --> 01:25:02,386
"It could've been me."

1373
01:25:02,556 --> 01:25:06,346
It could have been me
Could've been me

1374
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:08,138
Stay in it. Stay in it.

1375
01:25:09,396 --> 01:25:16,026
It could've been me

1376
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:19,607
Rocky ro--

1377
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:23,082
No! You're repeating yourself!

1378
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:27,754
Why can't l write
a fucking song anymore?

1379
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:31,461
I love the nightlife
I got to boogie

1380
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:34,456
On the disco 'round

1381
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:35,919
Oh, yeah

1382
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:38,919
I told you
I love the nightlife

1383
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:40,432
I got to boogie

1384
01:25:40,594 --> 01:25:44,104
On the disco 'round
Oh, yeah

1385
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:47,684
I'll tell you, I've never been
so truly satisfied.

1386
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:50,851
Living here in this beautiful
beach house with you...

1387
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:53,561
...my beautiful Cheryl Cox-Tiegs.

1388
01:25:53,732 --> 01:25:56,902
The ratings are great.
These are the salad days.

1389
01:25:57,068 --> 01:26:01,698
Yeah, l've been looking for something
my whole life, and this is it.

1390
01:26:01,948 --> 01:26:04,778
I'm finally truly satisfied.

1391
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:18,210
Goodbye, love

1392
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:22,261
You are not going home.
You are sleeping in the guestroom.

1393
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:24,137
Forever.

1394
01:26:24,304 --> 01:26:26,394
Because you're the only one
who stuck around.

1395
01:26:26,556 --> 01:26:28,596
Everyone else got sick of it
and left...

1396
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:31,477
...but you stuck around,
which means you're my friend.

1397
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:41,237
There's a starman waiting in the sky

1398
01:26:41,404 --> 01:26:43,164
He'd like to come and meet us

1399
01:26:43,323 --> 01:26:45,033
But he thinks he'd blow our minds

1400
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:49,410
There's a starman waiting in the sky

1401
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:53,119
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile

1402
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:54,501
He told me

1403
01:26:54,668 --> 01:26:57,998
Let the children use it
Let the children lose it

1404
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:00,381
Let all the children boogie

1405
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:02,882
Goddamn it!

1406
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:07,050
I mean, what do l have to do
to get you on my bone? Invent fire?

1407
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:10,812
And then huge laugh and we go
to commercial. All right, take five.

1408
01:27:11,184 --> 01:27:12,854
Hey.

1409
01:27:13,395 --> 01:27:15,475
Great rehearsal, Dewey.
Very funny sketch.

1410
01:27:16,439 --> 01:27:17,769
Thank you.
Have you seen the ratings?

1411
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:20,611
We're getting our ass kicked
by The Incredible Hulk.

1412
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:23,777
Well, last night's episode
was a very special episode.

1413
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:26,907
They revealed that the Incredible Hulk
has an evil twin.

1414
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:28,775
And he's not green. He's red.

1415
01:27:28,952 --> 01:27:31,082
I know. It was amazing.
Did you see it?

1416
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:34,286
You can't compete with that.
But we do need to do more promotion.

1417
01:27:34,457 --> 01:27:38,127
Here's what we'll do. We'll introduce
people to the new Dewey Cox.

1418
01:27:38,294 --> 01:27:42,264
I got a girl here to interview you.
She's from the local affiliate in Dallas.

1419
01:27:43,633 --> 01:27:46,473
I don't know.
I'm not so good on interviews.

1420
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:48,926
Bubbe, it's a puff piece.
It's very puffy.

1421
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:51,097
All you have to do
is remind the audience...

1422
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:55,136
...you're not mainlining acid anymore.
And the show, it's a lot of fun, right?

1423
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:56,481
-You're having fun.
-Yeah.

1424
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:59,146
It's on every Thursday night
after the local news.

1425
01:27:59,315 --> 01:28:03,235
"It's on every Thursday night after your
local news. I'm not mainlining acid."

1426
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:05,573
-Anymore.
-Oh, I'm not gonna promise that.

1427
01:28:05,739 --> 01:28:08,989
-Whatever you're comfortable with.
-"l don't smoke angel dust anymore.

1428
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:11,199
So don't be afraid."
Something like that?

1429
01:28:11,369 --> 01:28:13,829
Why don't you tell us about
your new TV program?

1430
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:16,787
Gail, it's a variety show.
I do a little bit of everything.

1431
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:19,748
I do some singing, some dancing,
chatting with the guests...

1432
01:28:19,919 --> 01:28:22,049
...the skits, the monologues,
the comedy.

1433
01:28:22,213 --> 01:28:23,843
Wonderful. Comedy.

1434
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:26,427
It really is a lot of fun.

1435
01:28:26,593 --> 01:28:28,473
We'll have more fun
when we come back...

1436
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:30,506
...from this word from our sponsors.

1437
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,010
Don't go away.

1438
01:28:34,017 --> 01:28:37,767
Okay, you know what, l gotta tell you,
my heart goes out to you.

1439
01:28:37,937 --> 01:28:41,357
I know what it's like to be on
a piece-of-shit television program...

1440
01:28:41,524 --> 01:28:44,534
-...because l'm hosting one right now.
-Excuse me?

1441
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:47,824
Must wanna blow your fucking
brains out, I'll bet. I know I do.

1442
01:28:49,115 --> 01:28:51,155
And we're back
with Mr. Dewey Cox.

1443
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:53,866
We're talking about the fun
he's having on his show.

1444
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:58,287
But right now, let's talk about your
lovely wife, Darlene. How's she doing?

1445
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:00,956
Darlene and l separated
some years ago, Gail.

1446
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:03,497
Oh, okay. Guess I didn't
do my homework.

1447
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:05,961
And to answer your question,
I miss her terribly.

1448
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:07,422
Well, that's sweet.

1449
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:10,802
Why don't we talk about your parents?
They've gotta be proud of you.

1450
01:29:11,304 --> 01:29:13,354
Well, my mom is dead.

1451
01:29:13,515 --> 01:29:18,385
And my pa and l don't
speak to each other...

1452
01:29:18,561 --> 01:29:20,731
...so we're not very close.

1453
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:25,145
We can always cut around this
if it gets too pathetic.

1454
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:28,488
Tell us about your kids.
I know you got a whole slew of them.

1455
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:31,405
I'm locked in a custody battle
at this time.

1456
01:29:31,574 --> 01:29:34,544
Custody is being forced upon me,
which l don't think is right.

1457
01:29:34,702 --> 01:29:37,752
You know, if you don't want
the responsibility of children...

1458
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:39,924
...you should be able to walk away...

1459
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:44,343
...and apparently a couple of my
ex-wives don't feel the same. So, yeah.

1460
01:29:44,504 --> 01:29:47,014
Wherever my kids are, they're
watching The Dewey Cox Show...

1461
01:29:47,173 --> 01:29:50,053
...on Thursday nights at 8:00,
right after the local news.

1462
01:29:50,426 --> 01:29:52,716
And l just wanted to say
to everyone out there...

1463
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:55,717
...l'm no longer mainlining acid
or smoking PCP.

1464
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:57,430
It's official.

1465
01:29:58,476 --> 01:30:01,596
Okay. Why don't we lighten it up
just a bit here?

1466
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:05,859
You're so busy, Dewey Cox, do you
have time to stop and smell the roses?

1467
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:08,362
I've got no fucking sense of smell.

1468
01:30:08,862 --> 01:30:09,862
All right, l'm done.

1469
01:30:10,029 --> 01:30:14,279
-Come on, folks. Do a little research.
-That would've been nice information.

1470
01:30:15,577 --> 01:30:18,497
I'm sorry, I must be tired
from the show or something.

1471
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:21,373
-lt's okay.
-Yeah, Dewey, it's okay.

1472
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:24,381
No, it's not okay.
I should be able to do this.

1473
01:30:24,544 --> 01:30:26,424
We're in no rush.

1474
01:30:27,046 --> 01:30:29,166
Should we get an
American Indian woman?

1475
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:33,180
No, that won't help. I mean,
it should already be pretty exciting.

1476
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,434
There's three of you.

1477
01:30:35,722 --> 01:30:37,472
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1478
01:30:41,311 --> 01:30:42,601
Yeah.

1479
01:30:44,898 --> 01:30:46,608
-Dewey.
-Nate?

1480
01:30:46,774 --> 01:30:48,534
You were supposed
to be double great.

1481
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:50,283
What the fuck is this bullshit?

1482
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:52,565
-l know.
-All l'm asking...

1483
01:30:52,739 --> 01:30:54,659
...is that you write one
masterpiece...

1484
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:57,374
...that is the culmination
of your entire life.

1485
01:30:57,535 --> 01:30:58,575
How hard is that?

1486
01:30:58,995 --> 01:31:02,365
I'm empty, Nate. What do l do?

1487
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:07,340
Dewey, who's the one person in your
life who's made you feel like shit?

1488
01:31:07,503 --> 01:31:09,883
-Pa.
-You need to talk to him, Dewey.

1489
01:31:10,715 --> 01:31:13,125
-l don't know.
-You need to hug him.

1490
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:17,680
I have been putting this off
my entire life...

1491
01:31:18,348 --> 01:31:20,518
...but l think you might be right.

1492
01:31:22,852 --> 01:31:25,352
The wrong kid died

1493
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:29,150
Hello, Pa.

1494
01:31:33,112 --> 01:31:34,492
What do you want?

1495
01:31:34,656 --> 01:31:37,116
I feel like there's some things
I need to say to you.

1496
01:31:37,367 --> 01:31:39,787
Well, go on. Talk.

1497
01:31:40,536 --> 01:31:42,656
I've realized that...

1498
01:31:43,122 --> 01:31:47,172
...l never really said I was sorry
for what happened with Nate.

1499
01:31:48,044 --> 01:31:51,004
Pa, l've spent my entire life...

1500
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:54,552
...trying to find love with wives...

1501
01:31:54,717 --> 01:31:56,547
...and hotel clerks...

1502
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:58,849
...and tollbooth attendants...

1503
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:02,183
...and giraffes and monkeys
and trampolines...

1504
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:05,440
...and men who dress like women
and men who look like you.

1505
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:11,189
And l realized the only person
I've ever really wanted to love me...

1506
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,320
...was you, Pa.

1507
01:32:16,906 --> 01:32:18,816
Dewey, l don't know what to say.

1508
01:32:18,992 --> 01:32:21,662
You don't have to say anything, Pa.

1509
01:32:21,828 --> 01:32:25,328
I just wanted to come here
and tell you that l loved you...

1510
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:27,287
...and l always have.

1511
01:32:29,919 --> 01:32:35,169
I appreciate you finding the courage
to say that, Dewey.

1512
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:38,550
But there's only one way
to settle this.

1513
01:32:40,847 --> 01:32:42,557
-Machetes.
-What?

1514
01:32:42,724 --> 01:32:45,484
The right kid is gonna die tonight.

1515
01:32:48,855 --> 01:32:50,765
You've been practicing!

1516
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:08,291
No, Pa. No!

1517
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:11,378
I been waiting for this
for a long time!

1518
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:13,254
You have?

1519
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:20,970
Oh, no.

1520
01:33:21,137 --> 01:33:23,387
Oh, my goodness!

1521
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:25,216
I halved myself.

1522
01:33:25,391 --> 01:33:27,931
Pa! No, Pa!

1523
01:33:28,102 --> 01:33:32,652
Dewey, l guess I never realized
until this moment...

1524
01:33:32,815 --> 01:33:38,145
...just how easy it is to accidentally
cut someone in half.

1525
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:39,361
It is, right?

1526
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:41,820
I'm sorry for blaming you, Dewey.

1527
01:33:41,991 --> 01:33:45,121
Of course you didn't mean
to cut Nate in half.

1528
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:47,446
It's all so obvious now.

1529
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:48,832
Pa.

1530
01:33:48,998 --> 01:33:51,578
I should've been a better father
to you, Dewey.

1531
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:55,381
I wish I spent more time
playing catch with you...

1532
01:33:55,546 --> 01:34:00,336
...and less time training my body
and mind to kill you in a machete fight.

1533
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:03,800
You be a better father
than l was, Dewey.

1534
01:34:03,971 --> 01:34:05,261
I'll try, Pa.

1535
01:34:05,431 --> 01:34:07,101
It shouldn't be that hard.

1536
01:34:07,266 --> 01:34:08,516
In case I don't make it--

1537
01:34:08,684 --> 01:34:12,234
Pa! You're gonna make it!
It's the 1 970s!

1538
01:34:12,396 --> 01:34:16,016
They got all kinds of new procedures
that can attach tops to bottoms now!

1539
01:34:16,192 --> 01:34:18,442
Hang in there! You're gonna be fine!

1540
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:22,361
I reckon you're probably right.
Now, go call the doctor...

1541
01:34:22,532 --> 01:34:25,202
-...and bring me some ice, a lot of ice.
-Some ice.

1542
01:34:25,368 --> 01:34:27,488
And a tourniquet.
Don't forget a tourniquet.

1543
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:30,372
-All right, ice and a tourniquet?
-lce and a tourniquet.

1544
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:32,960
-And a tourniquet.
-Don't forget that tourniquet.

1545
01:34:33,126 --> 01:34:36,456
And you know those three words
you always wanted to hear, Dewey?

1546
01:34:36,629 --> 01:34:38,129
Well, here they are.

1547
01:34:38,381 --> 01:34:39,881
I love....

1548
01:34:42,927 --> 01:34:44,007
You love what?

1549
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:46,465
Pa, you love what?

1550
01:34:46,764 --> 01:34:48,894
What was the third word?

1551
01:34:49,058 --> 01:34:50,518
Come on, one more word!

1552
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:52,885
No!

1553
01:34:54,981 --> 01:34:58,151
I want all you fucking parasites
out of my house...

1554
01:34:58,317 --> 01:34:59,647
...right now!

1555
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:02,609
I said, everybody out!

1556
01:35:03,156 --> 01:35:05,986
Well, look at you,
you arrogant cocksucker.

1557
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:09,159
-How dare you.
-What happened to you, Dewey?

1558
01:35:09,328 --> 01:35:12,958
I don't know what's happened to me,
but I know what happened to you.

1559
01:35:13,124 --> 01:35:14,924
Patrick Duffy took a beating.

1560
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:19,841
Stop it, Dewey, you son of a bitch.

1561
01:35:22,842 --> 01:35:25,802
Stop it! Patrick Duffy was only
saying what we were all feeling.

1562
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:29,060
You get the hell away from me,
Cheryl Cox-Tiegs!

1563
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:35,772
If you tear that sink off the wall,
I'm leaving you.

1564
01:35:35,938 --> 01:35:37,188
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

1565
01:35:40,193 --> 01:35:42,693
I'm leaving you, Dewey Cox.

1566
01:35:43,112 --> 01:35:44,612
No!

1567
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:33,409
Dad?

1568
01:36:36,332 --> 01:36:38,882
Yes, what is it, son?

1569
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:41,883
I was just wondering
if you wanna have a catch.

1570
01:36:43,965 --> 01:36:45,125
A catch?

1571
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:49,011
Son...

1572
01:36:49,512 --> 01:36:53,932
...there is nothing in this world
I want more...

1573
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:56,810
...than to have a catch with you.

1574
01:36:58,145 --> 01:37:02,565
Son, forgive me,
this is going to sound strange...

1575
01:37:03,567 --> 01:37:05,527
...but what is your name again?

1576
01:37:05,695 --> 01:37:08,855
I'm Dewey Junior,
but my friends call me Dewdrop.

1577
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:10,990
Well....

1578
01:37:14,996 --> 01:37:18,496
It's nice to formally meet you,
Dewdrop.

1579
01:37:18,749 --> 01:37:21,329
So this is catch.

1580
01:37:22,003 --> 01:37:25,173
This is what l been missing out
on all them years on the road, huh?

1581
01:37:25,965 --> 01:37:29,755
I like it. lt's wonderful. You throw
it to me, l throw it back to you.

1582
01:37:29,927 --> 01:37:33,217
It's so simple, and yet so powerful.

1583
01:37:34,348 --> 01:37:36,428
Boy, you're really terrible
at this game.

1584
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:39,270
Well, l mean, you never really
played with me before.

1585
01:37:39,437 --> 01:37:42,857
How am l supposed to learn?
A boy needs a dad.

1586
01:37:43,357 --> 01:37:45,147
Yes, he does.

1587
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:49,530
Well, l reckon we got some lost time
to make up, you and me.

1588
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:52,527
And all your brothers and sisters.
How many of you are there?

1589
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:56,870
Twenty-two brothers and sisters. And
also 14 half-brothers and half-sisters.

1590
01:37:57,038 --> 01:37:58,908
Holy shit.

1591
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:00,707
This may take a while.

1592
01:38:03,878 --> 01:38:05,588
That's real good.

1593
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:09,966
So beautiful.

1594
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,520
Are you sure you're one of mine?

1595
01:38:42,083 --> 01:38:44,043
Go ahead and taste some dirt.

1596
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:45,840
That's good dirt. That's good dirt.

1597
01:38:46,003 --> 01:38:48,963
On the surface,
Macbeth is about revenge.

1598
01:38:49,131 --> 01:38:50,341
But what is the subtext?

1599
01:38:50,508 --> 01:38:53,678
A power struggle for the Scottish
royal family. That's what it is.

1600
01:38:53,844 --> 01:38:55,764
I just gave you it.
That one's a mulligan.

1601
01:39:02,061 --> 01:39:03,521
Yeah.

1602
01:39:16,909 --> 01:39:17,949
Hello, Dewey.

1603
01:39:18,953 --> 01:39:20,543
Darlene.

1604
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:25,294
It's Dewina's birthday. l brought her
a present. It's a bracelet.

1605
01:39:26,502 --> 01:39:27,962
How's Glen Campbell?

1606
01:39:28,129 --> 01:39:29,919
He and l split up a long time ago.

1607
01:39:30,673 --> 01:39:31,843
Really?

1608
01:39:32,174 --> 01:39:34,134
It's just me these days.

1609
01:39:34,301 --> 01:39:35,681
At age 50.

1610
01:39:36,554 --> 01:39:39,604
Would you care to take a walk
with me, Darlene Madison?

1611
01:39:41,642 --> 01:39:43,232
I haven't been playing much music.

1612
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:49,359
I realize now I wasn't much of a father
when l was out on the road.

1613
01:39:49,692 --> 01:39:51,822
Now this is what makes me happy.

1614
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:55,816
Not the music, not getting high...

1615
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:57,820
...just my family.

1616
01:39:57,992 --> 01:39:59,492
That's all l care about.

1617
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:02,370
And that family is missing one piece,
Darlene.

1618
01:40:03,247 --> 01:40:06,327
My God, you're as beautiful
as the day I met you.

1619
01:40:11,714 --> 01:40:14,424
You don't want this dirty old Cox.

1620
01:40:14,592 --> 01:40:16,382
Oh, l want it more than ever.

1621
01:40:20,055 --> 01:40:22,015
Did you wash your hair today?

1622
01:40:22,183 --> 01:40:24,893
I sure did. How could you tell?

1623
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:27,480
It smells terrific.

1624
01:40:35,654 --> 01:40:36,864
I smelt it.

1625
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:39,031
You mean...?

1626
01:40:40,367 --> 01:40:42,197
I smelt it!

1627
01:40:43,454 --> 01:40:45,044
I can smell again!

1628
01:40:47,666 --> 01:40:49,126
I smelt it!

1629
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:51,713
-l smell you.
-Smell it.

1630
01:40:52,171 --> 01:40:53,961
Oh, you've been driving a while.

1631
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:57,045
I smelt it! l smelt it!

1632
01:40:57,218 --> 01:40:59,138
I smelt it, God!

1633
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:01,763
It's a miracle!

1634
01:41:01,931 --> 01:41:03,851
I smell you, flowers.

1635
01:41:04,016 --> 01:41:05,346
I smell you, twig.

1636
01:41:07,519 --> 01:41:09,059
I smell horseshit!

1637
01:41:12,566 --> 01:41:14,476
It's horrible!

1638
01:41:14,652 --> 01:41:17,112
-But l can smell it!
-Smell that shit, baby!

1639
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:19,029
I smelt it.

1640
01:41:24,870 --> 01:41:27,040
Anyway, that's when I learned...

1641
01:41:27,206 --> 01:41:30,916
...that Quaaludes and water-skiing
do not mix.

1642
01:41:31,085 --> 01:41:32,585
Now, you remember that.

1643
01:41:32,753 --> 01:41:35,213
How come you did all of that stuff,
Grandpa?

1644
01:41:35,381 --> 01:41:40,511
Well, Dewey Rahim, l'll tell you.
I was young and stupid then.

1645
01:41:40,678 --> 01:41:42,888
I didn't understand a lot of things.

1646
01:41:43,055 --> 01:41:46,265
Think it had to do with how
I was reared as a boy.

1647
01:41:46,642 --> 01:41:49,272
But, you know, I got no complaints.

1648
01:41:49,436 --> 01:41:51,596
It's been a beautiful ride.

1649
01:41:52,106 --> 01:41:53,356
A beautiful ride?

1650
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:59,027
A beautiful ride.

1651
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:03,950
Dewey, sweetheart,
there's someone here to see you.

1652
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:08,080
Mr. Cox.

1653
01:42:09,873 --> 01:42:11,543
I'm sorry, have we met?

1654
01:42:11,959 --> 01:42:15,169
You worked with my father,
Kvetch L'Chaim.

1655
01:42:15,337 --> 01:42:16,747
You're Mr. L'Chaim's boy?

1656
01:42:16,922 --> 01:42:19,422
Dreidel L'Chaim, that's me.

1657
01:42:19,591 --> 01:42:22,051
Well, it's nice to see you again,
Dreidel L'Chaim.

1658
01:42:22,219 --> 01:42:23,469
The pleasure's all mine.

1659
01:42:23,637 --> 01:42:27,637
Listen, Mr. Cox,
there's something l want to show you.

1660
01:42:27,808 --> 01:42:29,928
l never rock a fella
But l rock a Cinderella

1661
01:42:30,102 --> 01:42:32,942
While she's sittin' in between
A nigga's legs like a cello

1662
01:42:33,105 --> 01:42:34,855
Must be those pair of double-Ds

1663
01:42:35,024 --> 01:42:37,444
That got a nigga sittin'
Rock-hard in his jeans

1664
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:40,489
Time to play
Make your mouth into a hole, yo

1665
01:42:40,654 --> 01:42:41,824
Tell me how I feel
When I'm rockin' your boat

1666
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:44,159
-l wanna make you fuckin'
-Hard

1667
01:42:46,201 --> 01:42:48,161
I'm so wet, I gotta make you

1668
01:42:48,329 --> 01:42:52,079
Hard

1669
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:57,170
Mr. L'Chaim, how could you
allow them to do such a thing...

1670
01:42:57,338 --> 01:42:58,798
...with my husband's music?

1671
01:42:58,964 --> 01:43:00,804
Through the roof, we're selling.

1672
01:43:00,966 --> 01:43:03,626
Lil' Nutzzak. That's the rapper.
Sweet kid.

1673
01:43:03,802 --> 01:43:07,222
Anyway, he's introduced
a whole new generation...

1674
01:43:07,389 --> 01:43:09,389
...to the magic of Dewey Cox.

1675
01:43:09,558 --> 01:43:13,098
You could even play together.
Cox and Lil' Nutzzak. What a package.

1676
01:43:14,355 --> 01:43:16,015
Anyway, as if that was not enough...

1677
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:18,980
...they're giving Dewey the Lifetime
Achievement Award next month.

1678
01:43:21,528 --> 01:43:23,818
The Lifetime Achievement Award?

1679
01:43:23,989 --> 01:43:26,699
Baby, that's wonderful.

1680
01:43:26,867 --> 01:43:30,447
You go on TV, they give you the award,
you play a song, it's a magical thing.

1681
01:43:30,788 --> 01:43:32,908
I can't go on TV and play.

1682
01:43:33,082 --> 01:43:34,502
-What? Why not?
-Why, Grandpa?

1683
01:43:34,666 --> 01:43:39,336
Hell, I'm 71 years old. I don't even
know if I can rock no more.

1684
01:43:39,505 --> 01:43:43,545
Of course you can rock, sweetheart.

1685
01:43:43,717 --> 01:43:45,837
Well, l don't know that I can rock.

1686
01:43:47,221 --> 01:43:48,761
And besides that...

1687
01:43:51,433 --> 01:43:53,643
...l gave that life up for a reason.

1688
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:57,689
I'm afraid of the temptations,
Darlene.

1689
01:43:57,856 --> 01:44:01,106
You can do it, Dewey.
I know you can.

1690
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:04,150
Just go out there
and sing your song.

1691
01:44:07,616 --> 01:44:09,826
I'm gonna need my band.

1692
01:44:20,671 --> 01:44:22,421
My hip.

1693
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,060
Ladies and gentlemen...

1694
01:44:40,232 --> 01:44:44,572
...рlease welcome Jewel, Lyle Lovett
and Jackson Browne.

1695
01:44:44,736 --> 01:44:46,356
Walk hard

1696
01:44:47,865 --> 01:44:49,565
Hard

1697
01:44:50,075 --> 01:44:51,945
Down life's

1698
01:44:52,369 --> 01:44:54,499
-Rocky road
-Rocky road

1699
01:44:55,205 --> 01:44:56,535
Walk bold

1700
01:44:58,208 --> 01:45:00,078
Hard

1701
01:45:00,335 --> 01:45:02,495
That's my creed

1702
01:45:03,088 --> 01:45:05,378
-My code
-My code

1703
01:45:05,591 --> 01:45:09,391
I been scorned and slandered
And ridiculed too

1704
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:14,274
Had to struggle every day
My whole life through

1705
01:45:14,892 --> 01:45:18,812
Seen my share of the worst
This world can give

1706
01:45:19,354 --> 01:45:24,784
But l still got a dream
And a burnin' rage to live

1707
01:45:25,152 --> 01:45:27,322
-Hi.
-Hey there.

1708
01:45:27,488 --> 01:45:28,528
Hello.

1709
01:45:28,697 --> 01:45:31,067
Oh, he is so cute.

1710
01:45:31,241 --> 01:45:33,451
What are you doing later, Dewey?

1711
01:45:35,037 --> 01:45:39,167
I am returning to the hotel
with my family.

1712
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:41,460
Good night to you.

1713
01:45:43,587 --> 01:45:45,417
He fucked my grandma.

1714
01:45:45,589 --> 01:45:47,129
That's awesome.

1715
01:45:47,299 --> 01:45:48,379
Ghostface Killah.

1716
01:45:48,926 --> 01:45:51,336
Walking hard
I'm a real hard walker

1717
01:45:51,512 --> 01:45:54,102
Fast on the trigger
And a smooth talker

1718
01:45:54,264 --> 01:45:58,644
My guns pop out like a jack-in-the-box
I'll cut you in half like Dewey Cox

1719
01:45:58,810 --> 01:46:00,140
-Walk hard
-My skin stays scarred

1720
01:46:00,312 --> 01:46:01,812
You can ask God

1721
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:04,070
Lots of ladies unsnapped they bras

1722
01:46:04,233 --> 01:46:06,733
Ask Lyle Lovett
I had sex on Mars

1723
01:46:06,902 --> 01:46:09,322
That's how we do it
When we walk hard

1724
01:46:09,488 --> 01:46:12,028
-Walk hard
-How do I walk? Hard as a stone

1725
01:46:12,199 --> 01:46:14,489
How do l walk?
Hard like a bone

1726
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:17,040
-Walk hard
-How do l walk? Like a jackhammer tool

1727
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:19,664
How do l walk?
Harder than Jewel

1728
01:46:19,831 --> 01:46:24,671
Tell me how we walk
Hard, hard, hard, hard

1729
01:46:24,836 --> 01:46:26,916
Oh, no. You're adorable.

1730
01:46:27,089 --> 01:46:30,009
Sam. What are y'all doing in here?

1731
01:46:30,217 --> 01:46:33,507
Dewey, get out of here.
You don't want no part of this shit.

1732
01:46:33,929 --> 01:46:34,969
What is it?

1733
01:46:35,138 --> 01:46:37,598
It's a medication
for erectile dysfunction.

1734
01:46:37,766 --> 01:46:39,266
It gives you a boner.

1735
01:46:39,434 --> 01:46:41,734
Not to be used if you have
a heart condition.

1736
01:46:41,895 --> 01:46:45,435
If boners last for more than four hours,
call more ladies.

1737
01:46:46,108 --> 01:46:48,188
Well, that does sound tempting.

1738
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:52,200
But do you know what, Sam?
I really don't want no part of that shit.

1739
01:46:52,614 --> 01:46:55,244
Did you hear what l said?
It gives you a boner.

1740
01:46:55,409 --> 01:46:57,869
Hate to let you down, old friend...

1741
01:46:58,036 --> 01:47:00,616
...but l don't wanna succumb
to the temptations.

1742
01:47:00,747 --> 01:47:03,077
-My girl
-My girl

1743
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:06,590
Talkin' 'bout my girl, yeah

1744
01:47:06,878 --> 01:47:08,168
My girl

1745
01:47:09,381 --> 01:47:10,631
The Temptations!

1746
01:47:10,799 --> 01:47:13,929
When it's cold outside

1747
01:47:14,803 --> 01:47:17,183
I got the month of May

1748
01:47:27,316 --> 01:47:29,896
Do I still have what it takes?

1749
01:47:30,569 --> 01:47:33,489
Am l still the man I used to be?

1750
01:47:34,948 --> 01:47:37,618
And do l even want to be?

1751
01:47:37,909 --> 01:47:40,119
You're still Dewey Cox.

1752
01:47:40,287 --> 01:47:43,497
And you're the only man
who ever will be.

1753
01:47:44,082 --> 01:47:45,582
But is that enough?

1754
01:47:45,751 --> 01:47:47,251
It's more than enough.

1755
01:47:49,671 --> 01:47:54,341
Nate. Have l fulfilled my promise
to be double great for the both of us?

1756
01:47:54,509 --> 01:47:57,639
Are you kidding?
You've made 44 gold records.

1757
01:47:58,013 --> 01:48:00,103
You've been addicted to,
and then kicked...

1758
01:48:00,265 --> 01:48:01,965
...almost every drug known to man.

1759
01:48:02,142 --> 01:48:05,352
You slept with 41 1 women
and three men.

1760
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:08,480
Dewey, you have had
an awesome life.

1761
01:48:08,815 --> 01:48:10,815
I have, haven't l?

1762
01:48:10,984 --> 01:48:12,784
You sure have.

1763
01:48:14,196 --> 01:48:17,776
-Pa.
-Son, you learned the hard way.

1764
01:48:17,949 --> 01:48:20,789
You can't spend all your time
thinking about Dewey Cox.

1765
01:48:20,952 --> 01:48:23,622
You gotta think about the world
and your family.

1766
01:48:23,789 --> 01:48:26,119
But then, at the same time....

1767
01:48:26,291 --> 01:48:27,831
Are you my inner child?

1768
01:48:28,001 --> 01:48:31,001
-Yeah, Dewey, l'm you.
-He's us.

1769
01:48:31,213 --> 01:48:34,633
You realized you gotta take care
of Dewey Cox.

1770
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:37,970
That's a little different
than what I was saying.

1771
01:48:38,136 --> 01:48:39,386
You're all right.

1772
01:48:39,554 --> 01:48:44,644
Pa, inner child, Nate,
my own reflection.

1773
01:48:45,185 --> 01:48:48,725
I've learned that l can't spend
all my time thinking about Dewey Cox.

1774
01:48:48,897 --> 01:48:51,477
And l've also learned
I need to love Dewey Cox.

1775
01:48:51,650 --> 01:48:54,240
I can't spend all my time
thinking about other people.

1776
01:48:54,403 --> 01:48:56,153
I have to focus on myself.

1777
01:48:56,321 --> 01:49:01,161
But also not focus on myself
and instead focus on other people.

1778
01:49:01,326 --> 01:49:02,986
It's all so clear now.

1779
01:49:03,703 --> 01:49:06,413
It's not about yourself
and other people.

1780
01:49:06,581 --> 01:49:08,871
-Mama.
-lt's about the music.

1781
01:49:09,042 --> 01:49:12,342
-lt's about the music.
-lt always has been.

1782
01:49:13,255 --> 01:49:17,255
It always has been.

1783
01:49:17,843 --> 01:49:21,143
-Who are you?
-l'm your feminine side.

1784
01:49:21,304 --> 01:49:23,854
I've been waiting for you
to get in touch with me.

1785
01:49:26,518 --> 01:49:28,348
We heard him sing
about walking hard...

1786
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:31,770
...and we learned a little something
about how we wanted to walk.

1787
01:49:32,315 --> 01:49:35,775
What do we think about
when we think about Cox?

1788
01:49:35,944 --> 01:49:37,784
He's been called the Drifter.

1789
01:49:37,946 --> 01:49:42,366
Also the Shape Shifter,
the Master Chef, the Chameleon.

1790
01:49:42,534 --> 01:49:44,954
The Problem Child. The Hard One.

1791
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:48,040
The White lndian. The Giant Midget.

1792
01:49:48,248 --> 01:49:51,538
If Elvis and Buddy Holly are
the Cain and Abel of rock 'n' roll...

1793
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:53,920
...and Bruce Springsteen
is Zechariah...

1794
01:49:54,087 --> 01:49:55,917
...lggy Pop is Methuselah...

1795
01:49:56,089 --> 01:49:59,759
...and, of course, Neil Young
is the wise prophet Ezekiel...

1796
01:49:59,926 --> 01:50:02,716
...then what does
that make Dewey Cox?

1797
01:50:02,888 --> 01:50:04,638
Well, l don't know what God....

1798
01:50:04,806 --> 01:50:06,056
Mr. Cox?

1799
01:50:06,808 --> 01:50:09,388
I don't wanna rush him,
but he goes on in a minute.

1800
01:50:10,854 --> 01:50:15,654
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my great honor to introduce...

1801
01:50:15,817 --> 01:50:19,147
...for the first time on-stage
in 25 years...

1802
01:50:19,321 --> 01:50:22,411
...performing his final masterpiece...

1803
01:50:22,574 --> 01:50:25,164
...that will sum up his entire life...

1804
01:50:25,327 --> 01:50:26,907
Mr. Cox?

1805
01:50:27,162 --> 01:50:28,792
...the one, the only...

1806
01:50:28,955 --> 01:50:30,535
I'm ready.

1807
01:50:30,707 --> 01:50:32,667
...Mr. Dewey Cox.

1808
01:50:48,517 --> 01:50:50,557
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

1809
01:50:51,019 --> 01:50:52,849
You'll forgive me if I'm a bit rusty.

1810
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:55,861
This is the first song l've written
in a very long time.

1811
01:50:56,024 --> 01:50:57,114
I hope you enjoy it.

1812
01:50:59,194 --> 01:51:02,034
Now that I have lived

1813
01:51:02,614 --> 01:51:05,824
A lifetime's worth of days

1814
01:51:06,368 --> 01:51:08,868
Finally l see

1815
01:51:09,704 --> 01:51:13,464
The folly of my ways

1816
01:51:14,626 --> 01:51:17,336
So listen when l sing of

1817
01:51:17,671 --> 01:51:20,511
The temptations of this world

1818
01:51:21,216 --> 01:51:24,216
Fancy cars and needles

1819
01:51:25,971 --> 01:51:29,891
Whiskey, flesh and pearls

1820
01:51:30,225 --> 01:51:32,975
And then in the end

1821
01:51:33,478 --> 01:51:36,398
It's family and friends

1822
01:51:37,190 --> 01:51:39,360
Loving yourself

1823
01:51:39,693 --> 01:51:42,243
But not only yourself

1824
01:51:42,571 --> 01:51:46,241
It's about the good walk
And the hard walk

1825
01:51:46,408 --> 01:51:50,408
And the young girls you've made cry

1826
01:51:50,579 --> 01:51:55,169
It's about make a little music
Every day till you die

1827
01:51:55,917 --> 01:51:58,417
lt's a beautiful ride

1828
01:51:58,587 --> 01:52:02,417
Beautiful ride

1829
01:52:02,591 --> 01:52:04,261
A beautiful ride

1830
01:52:04,426 --> 01:52:08,596
Beautiful ride

1831
01:52:10,599 --> 01:52:13,729
Beautiful

1832
01:52:13,893 --> 01:52:18,773
Beautiful ride

1833
01:52:19,524 --> 01:52:22,444
As l stand on the precipice of death

1834
01:52:22,819 --> 01:52:25,489
My perspective is enormous

1835
01:52:26,114 --> 01:52:28,744
Every leaf, every cloud

1836
01:52:29,117 --> 01:52:32,287
I see the hands
Which have formed us

1837
01:52:32,662 --> 01:52:34,962
And some days all you got

1838
01:52:35,665 --> 01:52:38,375
Is a nighttime graveyard walk

1839
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:41,750
And you whistle some sweet melody

1840
01:52:41,921 --> 01:52:46,051
To the ghosts down at the dock

1841
01:52:47,052 --> 01:52:49,012
Sing into your hand

1842
01:52:50,347 --> 01:52:52,887
Lead the marching band

1843
01:52:53,516 --> 01:52:58,056
Don't you let 'em fade
Your colors gray

1844
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:02,318
'Cause when all is said and done

1845
01:53:02,817 --> 01:53:05,397
When youth is spent and burned

1846
01:53:06,237 --> 01:53:08,987
You'll see that it's all about

1847
01:53:09,157 --> 01:53:10,317
Music

1848
01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:11,910
Flowers

1849
01:53:12,410 --> 01:53:13,450
Babies

1850
01:53:14,037 --> 01:53:15,697
Sharin' the good times

1851
01:53:15,872 --> 01:53:17,962
Travelin' not just for business

1852
01:53:18,124 --> 01:53:20,584
Accepting your mortality

1853
01:53:20,752 --> 01:53:26,012
This is finally what l've learned

1854
01:53:26,508 --> 01:53:29,428
And then in the end

1855
01:53:29,594 --> 01:53:32,554
It's family and friends

1856
01:53:33,306 --> 01:53:35,466
Loving yourself

1857
01:53:35,725 --> 01:53:38,595
But not only yourself

1858
01:53:39,145 --> 01:53:42,145
It's about the good walk
And the hard walk

1859
01:53:42,482 --> 01:53:46,612
And the young girls you've made cry

1860
01:53:46,861 --> 01:53:52,281
It's about make a little music
Every day till you die

1861
01:53:52,450 --> 01:53:53,950
lt's a beautiful ride

1862
01:53:54,119 --> 01:54:06,129
Beautiful ride

1863
01:54:06,715 --> 01:54:09,585
Beautiful

1864
01:54:09,968 --> 01:54:24,898
Beautiful ride

1865
01:54:25,859 --> 01:54:28,649
Beautiful

1866
01:54:29,070 --> 01:54:36,240
Beautiful ride

1867
01:59:35,209 --> 01:59:36,749
Walk hard

1868
01:59:38,671 --> 01:59:40,211
Hard

1869
01:59:41,466 --> 01:59:43,046
Down life's

1870
01:59:44,177 --> 01:59:46,137
Rocky road

1871
01:59:47,764 --> 01:59:49,314
Walk bold

1872
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:52,140
Hard

1873
01:59:53,519 --> 01:59:55,309
That's my creed

1874
01:59:57,064 --> 01:59:59,904
My code

1875
02:00:00,067 --> 02:00:03,737
Walk hard
