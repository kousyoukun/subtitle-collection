1
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:52,382
Mr. cox?

2
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,051
Mr. cox?

3
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,252
Mr. cox?

4
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,989
Guys, l need cox.

5
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:07,223
He goes on in two minutes and l can't find him.

6
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,096
Mr. cox.

7
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,175
Mr. cox?

8
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,373
You're gonna have to give him a moment, son.

9
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,142
Dewey cox needs to think about his entire life 

10
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,142
before he plays.

11
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,644
Come on, nate, let's go play.

12
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,079
I can't, dewey. l gotta practice.

13
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:02,084
You can't practice all the time, nate. you're already perfect.

14
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,916
All right. come on, dewey, let's go play!

15
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,491
-today's gonna be the best day ever! -yeah!

16
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,424
Ain't nothing horrible gonna happen today.

17
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,157
What do you wanna be when you grow up, dewey?

18
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:17,063
I don't know. never really think about it before.

19
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,932
When l grow up, l'm gonna be a great composer.

20
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,074
And a professional baseball player.

21
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:26,109
Then l'm gonna be an astronaut, and l'm gonna go to the moon.

22
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,179
There's nothing l won't do with this long, long life of mine.

23
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:30,708
For sure.

24
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,648
That's what's great about being young. 

25
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:34,648
so much time to do great things.

26
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,879
Let's go play!

27
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,894
My turn!

28
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,302
I got him! I got him!

29
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,561
Catch!

30
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,205
Chicken!

31
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,055
I challenge you to a duel, sir.

32
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,525
I don't know, nate.

33
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,564
You know how mad pa gets when we play with his machetes.

34
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,862
Come on. there's nothing wrong with a little machete-fighting.

35
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,369
Now, en garde!

36
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,077
-do you yield, sir? -never!

37
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,545
Prepare to meet your maker.

38
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,587
-dewey! -nate!

39
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,389
I'm halved!

40
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,259
Oh, we should've listened to pa.

41
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,491
Dewey, l'm cut in half pretty bad.

42
00:03:56,369 --> 00:04:00,362
In case l don't make it, then you'll have to be double great...

43
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,063
...for the both of us.

44
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,468
Wow, that's a lot of pressure, nate.

45
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,043
You can handle it, dewey. now, run, get pa!

46
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,915
Holy shit.

47
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:21,618
This was a particularly bad case of somebody being cut in half.

48
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:27,132
I was not able to reattach the top half of his body...

49
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,164
...to the bottom half of his body.

50
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,936
Speak english, doc! we ain't scientists.

51
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,240
I'm sorry, folks. he's gone.

52
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,999
Oh, no!

53
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,575
Oh, my god.

54
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,042
Dear god. oh, dewey.

55
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,010
It's all your fault, dewey cox.

56
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:46,379
Oh, pa, you don't mean that. lt's not his fault.

57
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,880
He cut him in half with a machete.

58
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,147
No.

59
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:54,155
You. you're not half the boy that nate was.

60
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,329
You're not even half the boy that the top half of nate was...

61
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,293
...after you cut him in half.

62
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:03,230
So you're saying l'm less than a quarter of the boy nate was?

63
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,929
The wrong kid died.

64
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,541
Ma, l can't smell anything.

65
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,641
You can't smell anything?

66
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,313
I think l lost my sense of smell.

67
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,849
You gone smell-blind, son.

68
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,648
It'll pass, dewey.

69
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,323
Now, you run on down to the country store 

70
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,323
and get us some butter.

71
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,088
And a candle.

72
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,661
We're gonna light us a candle tonight.

73
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:47,408
I'm a gamblin' man

74
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,874
I gambled everywhere I go

75
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,245
Lord, I'm a gamblin' man

76
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,225
Gambled everywhere I go

77
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,930
I'm a gamblin' man

78
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:10,996
Lord, I gambled from door to door

79
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,061
I've never heard no music like that before.

80
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,128
It's so sad.

81
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,357
That's why it's called the blues, boy.

82
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,131
I think l'd like to play me some blues.

83
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:45,865
Ain't no 6-year-old boy 

84
00:06:46,037 --> 00:06:48,865
understand the true meaning of the blues.

85
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,134
I reckon l might.

86
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,011
You play the guitar?

87
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:56,306
Never have before. but l'm a real fast learner.

88
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,108
Well, go ahead.

89
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,924
You put your finger right up there. 

90
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:05,924
place your hands here. that's it.

91
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,251
That's the g chord.

92
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,821
Now hit the strings with your other hand.

93
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,401
-that's it. -there you go.

94
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,178
That ain't bad.

95
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:33,975
I done a bad thing

96
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:39,179
Cut my brother in half

97
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,427
I done a bad, bad thing

98
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:53,538
Cut my brother in half

99
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,771
My mama's gonna cry

100
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:09,514
Somewhere the devil's havin' a laugh

101
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,686
It's not bad for your first time.

102
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,888
You can do it, dewey. you'll be double great.

103
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,088
For the both of us.

104
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,107
Dewey?

105
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,043
Dewey.

106
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,745
Dewey?

107
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,979
Mama, you made it!

108
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,682
There's my favorite 14-year-old son.

109
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,557
Oh, no. come on, now. not in front of the fellas.

110
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:52,822
Howdy, boys.

111
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,761
Howdy, mrs. cox.

112
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,457
I just wanted to say break a leg.

113
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,035
I know you boys are gonna play a real good song.

114
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,466
Oh, thanks, ma.

115
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:04,074
I'm just so proud you learned to play the guitar so good.

116
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,035
Without even having a sense of smell.

117
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:10,147
It's all right now, mama. l learned how to play by ear.

118
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,442
You just go out there and sing your heart out.

119
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,415
I will, mama.

120
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,754
I don't know what we're doing here 

121
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:18,754
at this high school talent show.

122
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,984
We're here to see our boy, that's what we're doing here.

123
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,023
You all right, ma'am?

124
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,931
I'm fine.

125
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,670
Just my vertigo acting up again.

126
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,932
-what's vertigo? -just a little dizziness is all.

127
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:40,001
Ain't nothing terrible ever came from no dizziness.

128
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,481
Testing, testing.

129
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,207
Crawdad, crawdad.

130
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,676

Please welcome dewey cox and the dewey cox four.

138
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,674
Hi. my name's dewey cox.

139
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:55,342
And this is a little song l wrote called 'take my hand.''

140
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:56,919
I sure hope you like it.

141
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:00,320
The wrong kid died, goddamn it.

142
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,266
-take -take, take

143
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,401
Take my hand

144
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:11,763
Take my hand

145
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,405
We're gonna walk through the park

146
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:19,977
I promise to have you home before dark

147
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,380
Home before dark

148
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,550
Oh, life would be so sweet

149
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:29,212
Walking with you down the street

150
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,222
This music is an outrage!

151
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,717
Come on and take my hand

152
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,656
Come on and take my hand

153
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,921
It's the devil's music!

154
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:42,589
It's all right if you're coy

155
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:46,670
After all I'm a boy

156
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,339
And you're a girl

157
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,736
But make no mistake

158
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:54,513
Yours is the hand I want to take

159
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,306
So please

160
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,506
So please, please

Take my hand

162
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,014
You're going to hell!

163
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,683
Blasphemer!

164
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,592
That's it. l want you out of this house, boy.

165
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,197
-pa! -you heard the preacher.

166
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,925
You think we don't know what you're talking about...

167
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,569
...when you say ''take my hand''?

168
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,363
What? lt's about holding hands.

169
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,562
You watch your mouth.

170
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,834
You know who's got hands? the devil.

171
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,069
And he uses them for holding.

172
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:31,483
I ain't got no room in my house for no devil's spawn.

173
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,284
Be careful. before you say something 

174
00:12:34,284 --> 00:12:35,984
you regret for the rest of your days.

175
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,748
Like what? like ''the wrong kid died''?

176
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,050
Oh, no! no!

177
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,126
Lt's okay. lt's okay, mama, settle down.

178
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,124
Pa's right.

179
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:49,126
Springberry ain't big enough for me no more.

180
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:52,128
I reckon it's time for dewey cox to move on.

181
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,097
But you're only 1 4.

182
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,741
Mama, l love you.

183
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,939
But l don't need nobody.

184
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,275
All l need is my music.

185
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,984
I seen my path today, and l'm gonna take it.

186
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:10,644
And someday, l'll make my masterpiece...

187
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:13,586
...and you'll all be proud of me.

188
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,488
Just like you were of nate.

189
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,893
Can l come, dewey?

190
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,759
Of course you can, edith. you're my girlfriend.

191
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,490
-l am? -yeah, silly.

192
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,931
I pointed at you in the audience.

193
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:29,697
Did you hear that? l'm dewey's 1 2-year-old girlfriend!

194
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,673
You're the most talented man l've ever seen in my whole life.

195
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:33,609
And you will never get anything 

196
00:13:33,878 --> 00:13:36,609
but love and support from me...

197
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,683
...for you and your dreams the rest of my life.

198
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:43,116
Well, then, go on. get out of this house.

199
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,691
Before l cut your dreams in half 

200
00:13:46,322 --> 00:13:47,691
like you cut mine in half.

201
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,793
Goodbye, pa.

202
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:53,829
Just wait till you see what happens now.

203
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,296
Here we go.

204
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:02,106
Ma and pa leave home all the kids get glad

205
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,139
You know our house's gonna jump like mad

206
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,436
We're gonna jump, li'l children, jump

207
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,636
We're gonna jump, li'l children, jump

208
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:12,845
We're gonna jump, li'l children mama and papa's gone

209
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,080
Let's jump, jump, jump jump, jump, jump

210
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,117
Jump, jump, jump jump, jump, jump

211
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,987
We're gonna jump, li'l children mama and papa's gone

212
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,755
Play it for me, daddy!

213
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,740
That's a sexy look right there.

214
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,467
Oh, l like it, l like it.

215
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,941
Let's jump, jump, jump jump, jump, jump

216
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,544
Jump, jump, jump jump, jump, jump

217
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:46,183
Jump, jump, jump jump, jump, jump

218
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,285
Jump, jump, jump jump, jump, jump

219
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:51,820
We're gonna jump, li'l children mama and papa's gone

220
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,286
You know what l'm saying.

221
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,290
We're gonna jump, li'l children mama and papa's gone

222
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,122
Let's take them home, fellas.

223
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,494
We're gonna jump, li'l children mama and papa's gone

224
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,566
Yeah, baby. wrap it up right there.

225
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,471
I'm gonna take one of them home tonight.

226
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,143
My name is bobby shad and these are the bad men.

227
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,505
We gonna take a break, then we be right back...

228
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,307
...to rock till the morning light, all right?

229
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:23,519
Mr. shad! mr. shad! wow, that was really great.

230
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,849
Hey, l play a little guitar. lf you ever need--

231
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,322
-dewey! -yes, sir?

232
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,427
I pay you to mop, not bother the band.

233
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,588
My customers come to dance erotically, 

234
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:34,588
and they need a clean floor to do it on!

235
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,791
Do your job or l'll find somebody who will.

236
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,594
Yes, sir.

237
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,934
Lonesome blues

238
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,274
Dewey, will you cut out that racket? 

239
00:15:48,546 --> 00:15:50,274
l'm trying to feed your child!

240
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,213
How am l supposed to make it as a famous musician 

241
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:54,213
if l don't practice?

242
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,752
Will you stop talking about that music?

243
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,423
But it's my dream, baby.

244
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,922
I am tired of hearing about your dreams, dewey cox.

245
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,253
You are a selfish dickhole.

246
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:04,894
Daddy said if we move home, 

247
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:07,894
he could give you a job at the slaughterhouse.

248
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,624
You can make an honest living.

249
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,896
Wouldn't have to hang your head in shame, 

250
00:16:12,235 --> 00:16:13,896
walking around like a failure.

251
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,075
I think l'm doing okay for a 15-year-old 

252
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:17,075
with a wife and a baby.

253
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,834
But, sweetheart...

254
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,512
...l thought you liked working 

255
00:16:21,944 --> 00:16:22,912
at the slaughterhouse for my daddy.

256
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,514
I did.

257
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,745
You got a real talent for this, boy.

258
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:33,755
Someday this is all gonna be yours.

259
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:39,289
It's just, as much as l loved it, edith, l want more than that.

260
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:43,025
Ain't no musician ever made no money, dewey.

261
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,962
What? of course they do. plenty of them do.

262
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,433
Name one.

263
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,736
-slim whitman. -who the hell is slim whitman?

264
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,411
All right, frank sinatra.

265
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,007
Who the hell is frank sinatra?

266
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,979
Edith, l am starting to think...

267
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,986
...that maybe you don't believe in me.

268
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,186
I do believe in you.

269
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,255
I just know you're gonna fail.

270
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,184
-what are you talking about, edith? -what about my dreams?

271
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,092
Edith, l told you, l can't build you a candy house!

272
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,597
It will fall down! the sun will melt the candy! lt won't work!

273
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,201
It will if it never rains.

274
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:22,270
Dewey, you have got to give up your dream.

275
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:27,609
Dreams don't come true.

276
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:35,049
I am gonna make this dream come true.

277
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,518
Nobody ever said it's gonna be easy.

278
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,781
It's hard.

279
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,749
It ain't easy to walk to the top of a mountain.

280
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,258
It's a long, hard walk.

281
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,432
It's a rocky road.

282
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,430
But l plan on walking.

283
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,169
Oh, l'm gonna walk.

284
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,669
Hard.

285
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,934
I will walk hard.

286
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,909
Walk hard.

287
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,757
I got a full house coming tonight.

288
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,519
If bobby shad can't play l need to find someone who can.

289
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,958
I'm fine. l can play through the pain.

290
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,063
Should've thought before 

291
00:18:21,264 --> 00:18:22,463
you punched your landlord and got laryngitis.

292
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,295
I guess there's no music tonight.

293
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,802
Bullhickey! people come here to dance erotically!

294
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,668
I ain't got no music, l ain't got no nightclub.

295
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,840
Excuse me.

296
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,172
I play a little.

297
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,872
I don't know how to tell you this, boy.

298
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:42,247
You're white. this crowd will eat you alive.

299
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:46,015
I been watching mr. shad every night. l know all the songs.

300
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,385
It'll be the same show.

301
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:48,892
It'll be just like bobby shad and the bad men, 

302
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:50,892
only it'll be me tonight.

303
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,663
This is crazy.

304
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,696
But l ain't got no other choice.

305
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,499
I don't mean to put more pressure on you, boy.

306
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:07,110
The suits from the record company just got here.

307
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,242
Oh, okay.

308
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,117
Scared?

309
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,522
-a little. -well, you should be.

310
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,988
Those jews control show business.

311
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,787
Just lay it down exactly like bobby does.

312
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,890
Good evening. we're bobby shad and the bad men.

313
00:19:28,431 --> 00:19:30,390
l'm dewey cox.

314
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,231
Bobby shad couldn't be here tonight 

315
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:34,231
so l'm gonna do his show for you.

316
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,304
And l hope you enjoy it.

317
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,641
This first song we're fitting to do is....

318
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,576
Well, it's about....

319
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,249
It's about when your woman catches you.

320
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:50,353
You know, she catches you running around town...

321
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,751
...getting into all kinds of strange.

322
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,425
This is racially insensitive.

323
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:55,023
And she says

324
00:19:55,626 --> 00:19:59,723
"son, get your lazy, two-timing,negro ass up out of here."

325
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,923
-what's he doing? you see that?

326
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,796
You got to love your negro man

327
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,569
You got to love your negro man

328
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,565
You got to love your negro man

329
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,972
You got to love your negro man

330
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,673
You got to love, love

331
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,372
-ls he playing ''negro man''? -he is playing ''negro man.''

332
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,074
He's playing ''negro man.''

333
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,845
From early in the morning till late at night

334
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,523
You know I love your apples let me take a bite

335
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,954
You got to love your negro man

336
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,594
You got to love your negro man

337
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,094
You got to love, love, love, love, love

338
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,027
Your negro man

339
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,599
Yeah, come on, dewey.

340
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,963
I know I treat you wrong and that ain't right

341
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,662
Let me put it on you, mama and you'll feel all right

342
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,273
You got to love your negro man

343
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,967
You got to love your negro man

344
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,576
You got to love, love, love, love, love

345
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,772
Your negro man

346
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:05,285
Now, that's what l call winning over an audience.

347
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,592
Go, dewey, go.

348
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,699
I like what you did out there tonight. 

349
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,699
have you ever made a recording?

350
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:22,305
Oh, mr. l'chaim, mr. mazeltov, that's been my dream.

351
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:25,278
He's not the one you want. l'm the one you want.

352
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:28,214
-l think he's the one we want. -he's got a nice thing.

353
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,081
He's not bad with the singing 

354
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,981
and the playing and the shaking of the tochis.

355
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:36,192
I think you've got what it takes to make it in the big time.

356
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,220
The big time?

357
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:44,095
When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie

358
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,895
That's amore

359
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:48,072
When the world seems to shine

360
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:49,297
What the hell is this?

361
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:52,204
Pizza pie. what's in a pizza pie?

362
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:56,006
Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling

363
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:59,012
And you'll sing ''vita bella''

364
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,412
Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay

365
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,588
Please, l can't anymore.

366
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:07,785
That's what l was gonna say.

367
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:13,795
-that's amore -amore

368
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,706
That is amore

369
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:25,001
All right. hold, please. stop that. stop your singing!

370
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,269
Stop your singing this instant, young man!

371
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,743
I will not have this in my studio!

372
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,313
That's just a terrible, terrible...

373
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:36,647
...terrible, terrible ''that's amore.''

374
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,252
Maybe it was a wrong song choice?

375
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,588
If you just let me play one of my songs, 

376
00:22:41,858 --> 00:22:43,588
I think you'll like it a whole lot better.

377
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:47,322
You have failed conclusively. lt's over.

378
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,500
And there is nothing that you can do...

379
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,431
...here in this room that can turn that around.

380
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:56,403
Nothing you can do that can make up for what you did to ''that's amore.''

381
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:57,877
well, my mother liked it a whole lot. 

382
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,677
your mother was wrong.

383
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,541
L was willing to open my mind...

384
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,649
...because these jewish gentlemen brought you in here.

385
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,648
They usually have good taste.

386
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:11,389
And now here you are in front of me pretending you can sing.

387
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,717
And l have to say that today...

388
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:17,292
...your performance has shaken my belief in the jewish people.

389
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,691
Well, there's nothing l would like more, sir...

390
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,595
...than to restore your faith in judaism, 

391
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:23,595
if you could just give me that shot.

392
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,929
But l'll tell you, you have failed so far...

393
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:29,904
...and if somehow you are able to sing a song now...

394
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:32,633
...bringing these boys together you haven't even met...

395
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,405
...and make something so personal, so new...

396
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,849
...that the whole world takes notice...

397
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:40,950
...and that your life is never the same again....

398
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:45,619
But l'm telling you right now, l don't think it's going to happen.

399
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,989
Wait, wait, wait. we're here already. 

400
00:23:48,258 --> 00:23:49,989
what could it possibly hurt?

401
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,489
L'chaim, l'll do it for you. but just one more song.

402
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,256
All right.

403
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,668
All right, son. l'm gonna give you 15 more seconds.

404
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,701
Thank you, sir. l hope you won't regret it.

405
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:09,173
Dewey, we don't know this song.

406
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,541
You just follow me.

407
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:13,843
I don't know.

408
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,768
Walk hard

409
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,565
Hard

410
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:36,968
Walk hard?

411
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:40,269
Down life's rocky road

412
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,008
Walk bold

413
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:46,680
Hard

414
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,920
That's my creed

415
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,648
My code

416
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:56,225
I been scorned and slandered and ridiculed too

417
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:01,029
Had to struggle every day my whole life through

418
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,603
Seen my share of the worst that the world can give

419
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:11,267
But I still got a dream and a burnin' rage to live

420
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,371
Walk hard

421
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:15,776
Hard

422
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:19,777
Here is america's new hit song 'walk hard''...

423
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:23,284
...recorded just 35 minutes ago by dewey cox.

424
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,118
Hard

425
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,449
Though they say

426
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,390
You're not the one

427
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:34,929
Even if you've been told time and time again

428
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:39,495
That you're always gonna lose and never gonna win

429
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:43,336
You gotta keep that vision in your mind's eye

430
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:49,336
When you're standin' on top of a mountain high

431
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,713
He walks so hard.

432
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,358
How do l walk, boys?

433
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:03,860
Hard

434
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:09,999
When I meet my maker on my dying day

435
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:14,101
I'm gonna look him in the eye and by god, I'll say

436
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,005
I gave my word and my word was good

437
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:23,210
I took it in the face and I walked as hard as I could

438
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,350
Oh, hey, shorty. hello, my darling.

439
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:29,179
L sang a song at a circus in new jersey.

440
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:31,184
They said, ''we'll give you 5 grand.''

441
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:34,051
L said, ''no, you won't. you'll give me that giraffe.''

442
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:37,989
-and they did. they gave it right to me. -that is one beautiful giraffe.

443
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,185
Thank you.

444
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,626
It'll just be a few weeks, edith.

445
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,926
Who's gonna help me take care of the children?

446
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:46,626
Dewey, you have got to give up this dream.

447
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,932
You're never gonna make it. give it up, dewey.

448
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:54,109
What are you talking about? l got a number one hit on the radio.

449
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,542
I'm playing my music for people who wanna hear me.

450
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,545
It's everything we always wanted, edith.

451
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,981
I never get to see you anymore. your kids never get to see you.

452
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,379
I don't know how to tell you this.

453
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,113
I'm gonna miss some things, okay?

454
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:08,792
I'm gonna miss some birthdays and some christenings.

455
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,689
I'm gonna miss some births, period ok£¿

456
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:14,023
Unrealistic to think l'm gonna be here every time you have a baby.

457
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,666
But aren't you happy? you have a beautiful new home.

458
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:20,599
All your fancy new clothes and your monkey and your giraffe.

459
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,973
Look, what else you need?

460
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:26,974
How about l get you a crow that could talk?

461
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,611
And l'll teach him phrases that l say. 'good morning, honey.''

462
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,512
but it'll be a little crow talking. 

463
00:27:32,815 --> 00:27:34,512
this ain't about no exotic pets!

464
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:37,779
It's about love, you stupid piece of shit.

465
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,116
-dewey. -edith!

466
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,793
Don't you go in the bathroom.

467
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,962
Edith, please.

468
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,326
Mama said there's a lot of evil on the road.

469
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,364
Temptations.

470
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:53,093
They'll make a man do evil things.

471
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:58,469
Edith, that is ridiculous. Is that what this is all about?

472
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,907
There ain't no evil out there.

473
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:03,744
Come on, now, cupcake, open the door.

474
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,215
Edith.

475
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:15,224
My beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel.

476
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,288
You know how much l love you.

477
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:23,934
You and this fast-growing family of ours...

478
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:26,103
...is the only thing that matters to me.

479
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:27,828
You understand that?

480
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,840
Heck, life without you would be like no life at all.

481
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:38,380
Like no life at all.

482
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,347
Where's a pencil? where's a pencil?

483
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,420
Dewey!

484
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,116
Hello, baby!

485
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:50,454
Yeah, this is the big bopper speaking.

486
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,290
Oh, you sweet thing.

Oh, baby, you know what l like.

490
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:08,174
Chantilly lace and a pretty face and a ponytail

491
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,279
How are we supposed to follow that?

492
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,279
Don't worry, dewey, you'll do great.

493
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:15,282
-thanks, buddy holly. -lf you don't, l'll pick it back up.

494
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,648
-you got nothing to worry about. -oh, thank you.

495
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,057
I really like that ''walk hard'' song.

496
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:22,091
Oh, thanks.

497
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:23,490
I like that ''peggy sue'' song. 

498
00:29:23,893 --> 00:29:25,490
It's my favorite buddy holly song.

499
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:28,131
Thanks, dewey. l'm awful proud of that one.

500
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,358
Man, l'm awful nervous, buddy holly.

501
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:33,833
Dewey, you'll be fine, or my name's not buddy holly.

502
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,337
Hey guys,change of plans. 

503
00:29:35,838 --> 00:29:37,337
elvis wants to get out of here early. he's hungry.

504
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,511
So we'll change the order. after the big bopper, it's buddy holly...

505
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,806
...then elvis presley, and then you, dewey cox.

506
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:47,109
So it's the big bopper...

507
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:48,842
...and then buddy holly...

508
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:52,489
...and then elvis presley, and then me?

509
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,022
Yeah. just for tonight.

510
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:58,684
Well, l'm just happy to be here.

511
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,030
What am l doing?

512
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:06,430
L ain't good enough to follow elvis.

513
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,106
What are you talking about, dewey?

514
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,839
Nate. nate, is that you?

515
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:18,982
You can do it, dewey. l know you can.

516
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:22,676
L know because l'm your brother, and l believe in you.

517
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:25,185
But, hell, ain't nobody can follow elvis.

518
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:28,615
-wait, did you say elvis? -yeah.

519
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,625
Elvis presley? the king of rock 'n' roll?

520
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,195
Yeah, elvis presley.

521
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,423
He has nine number one hits.

522
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,032
Nate, l understand that.

523
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,066
He has 50 million fans.

524
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,704
I'm aware of that, nate. 

525
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:41,704
I'm trying to figure it out that's why l'm out here.

526
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,203
I'm having a crisis.

527
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:45,066
Holy shit.

528
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,772
Dewey! the big fella's on his final encore. are you ready?

529
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:54,582
Yeah. l'm ready.

530
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:03,660
Elvis!

531
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,688
Ladies.

532
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:09,765
Dang, elvis presley, you didn't have to rile them up like that.

533
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,595
What, now?

534
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:13,667
-no, l'm-- -excuse me, what?

535
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,999
L'm just saying, we gotta follow that and--

536
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,805
Well, sometimes you have to go all out 

537
00:31:18,207 --> 00:31:19,005
when you're the king you cant help.

538
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,440
Because there's only one man who's the king.

539
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,511
God picks him, hand-plucks him.

540
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,212
One night, god looked down at

541
00:31:25,715 --> 00:31:27,412
all the millions and millions of people, man...

542
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:31,020
...and he decided which one was the best, and it was me.

543
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,988
He plucked me from all those millions and millions of people, man.

544
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:37,419
-yeah. -listen to this, right now.

545
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:41,121
There's two things you need to know. -i'm the king and no. two is

546
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,857
Look out, man! look at that coming at you. you see that?

547
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,628
Lt's called karate and only two kinds of people know it.

548
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:48,965
The chinese and the king.

549
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:50,606
And one of them is me.

550
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:51,832
You're the king.

551
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:53,672
On to memphis, 

552
00:31:54,043 --> 00:31:55,672
they want a nice little honey and a little bit of june bug.

553
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,507
-yeah? -yeah....

554
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:01,141
Come on, man....

555
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:04,644
Look out, man!

556
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:07,251
Well, thanks, elvis.

557
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,562
Let's go. come on, mama.

558
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,858
What the fuck was he talking about?

559
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:21,566
How y'all doing? my name's dewey cox.

560
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:27,573
And, well, looks like l got some proving myself to do.

561
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,178
Sam.

562
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,523
Walk hard

563
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,123
Hard

564
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:49,765
Down life's rocky road

565
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,875
Wow, great playing, boys.

566
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,601
The fillies love you, dewey.

567
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,000
If l wasn't married man with a good head on my shoulders, 

568
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,145
I don't know what l'd do.

569
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,909
You gotta get back out there. they are going crazy.

570
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:08,779
Let me splash some water on my face i'll be right back

571
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,579
Okay. hurry up!

572
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:15,121
Golly, that rock 'n' roll.

573
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,826
-get out of here, dewey. -what are y'all doing in here?

574
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:25,764
We're smoking reefer, and you don't want no part of this shit.

575
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,335
You're smoking reefers?

576
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,301
Of course we are. can't you smell it?

577
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,469
No, sam, l can't.

578
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,542
Come on, dewey, join the party.

579
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:38,477
No, dewey, you don't want this. get out of here!

580
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,345
I don't want no hangover. I can't get no hangover.

581
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:43,645
It doesn't give you a hangover.

582
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,756
Will l get addicted to it or something?

583
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,653
It's not habit-forming.

584
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,161
Oh, okay, well....

585
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:55,120
I don't know. l don't wanna overdose on it.

586
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,900
You can't od on it.

587
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:59,502
It's not gonna make me wanna have sex, is it?

588
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,331
It makes sex even better.

589
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:03,573
Sounds kind of expensive.

590
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,834
It's the cheapest drug there is.

591
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:09,405
You don't want it.

592
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,871
I think l kind of want it.

593
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,142
Okay, but just this once. come on in.

594
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,816
-what do l do? -like this.

595
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:38,665
Oh, my.

596
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,040
Hey, listen, folks. 

597
00:34:40,276 --> 00:34:43,040
I'd like to play a song l wrote for a very special lady.

598
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,306
I'm talking about mrs. dewey cox.

599
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,879
Oh, my darling'

600
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,056
Oh, my darlin'

601
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,420
I have a perfect life

602
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:04,795
You are the perfect wife

603
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:08,961
I don't know why

604
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:13,576
I sit and cry

605
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:18,675
And now I miss you so

606
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:23,081
Please don't let me go

607
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,916
I make mistakes and that is true

608
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:31,791
At least I learn each time I do

609
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:32,985
Here, have some of this.

610
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:35,529
Darling, you must believe

611
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:41,467
I could never leave you if I tried

612
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,769
A life without you

613
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:53,713
Is no life at all

614
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:57,914
Oh, my darlin'

615
00:35:58,122 --> 00:35:59,953
Oh, my darlin'

616
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,625
Beth anne.

617
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,296
Can l get that for you?

618
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,964
Thanks, dewey.

619
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:12,760
Tears fall in vain

620
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:17,236
I'm standing in the rain

621
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:21,537
No matter how I feel

622
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:26,581
I never seem to know what's real

623
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:30,117
So sharpen up your knives

624
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:33,313
-can l get that for you? -thanks, dewey.

625
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,157
L'm a bad horse.

626
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,956
Phil, can l get that for you?

627
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,733
Thanks, dewey.

628
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,962
Darling, you must believe

629
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:50,367
I could never leave you if I tried

630
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,908
Phil? what happened?

631
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:58,072
A life without you

632
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:06,587
Is no life at all

633
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,730
Well, the tour's going real great, baby.

634
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,990
Yeah, we're having a real nice time.

635
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,259
Yeah, the boys have been playing great...

636
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:21,029
...and the audiences have been just wonderful, so....

637
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,537
-when you coming home? -soon, baby, real soon.

638
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,972
We gotta hit the major markets in the northeast, 

639
00:37:25,241 --> 00:37:26,972
chicago, detroit--

640
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:28,875
Dewey, could you shut up? 

641
00:37:29,178 --> 00:37:30,875
I'm trying to have sex with these women down here.

642
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,606
Who's that?

643
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,748
Oh, that's sam.

644
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:39,150
-he's just looking for his drumsticks. -howdy.

645
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:40,949
Excuse me.

646
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:46,827
Anyway, you don't wanna hear about this boring stuff. 

647
00:37:46,827 --> 00:37:47,297
how was your day?

648
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,994
Oh, you know, just taking care of the kids.

649
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:53,568
Went down to wilson's market the other day to pick up some milk.

650
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:54,638
Completely out of milk. 

651
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:56,638
I had to go all the way down to peach street.

652
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,537
-i hate going down there. -oh, brother. can you believe it?

653
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:00,768
-yes, bert? -hey, dewey.

654
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:03,208
-you want a cup of coffee? -no, thank you.

655
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,746
Will you give me a minute? l'm on the phone here.

656
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,580
-who's that? -that's bert, my roadie.

657
00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:11,179
Just wants to know if l want any coffee or anything like that.

658
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,621
Dewey, there's a distance growing between us, 

659
00:38:15,923 --> 00:38:16,621
I feel, and l don't like it.

660
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,920
Oh, now, that is crazy talk, edith.

661
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,654
You know l'm just the same old dewey.

662
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,594
-hey, dewey. -yes, bert?

663
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,028
You seen my sandals?

664
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,900
I don't know. I'm talking to my wife, bert.

665
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,235
Baby, there's somebody at the door. l gotta go.

666
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,069
Can I call when I get to new jersey?

667
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:34,608
Okay. bye, dewey.

668
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,143
-i love you. -all right.

669
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:37,541
-i love you. -l love you.

670
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:40,148
-you're never gonna make it, okay? -okay, bye.

671
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:41,811
Bye.

672
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:48,116
-pa. -dewey.

673
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,953
What are you doing here?

674
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:51,455
It's about your mama.

675
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:55,595
Ma? what about her? ls she okay?

676
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:00,964
We better step out into the hall.

677
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:07,207
-what happened? -l'll tell you what happened.

678
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:09,314
We were readying for bed

679
00:39:09,445 --> 00:39:12,314
when your song comes on the radio.

680
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,484
It's dewey!

681
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:17,977
Your son is talented. you should be proud.

682
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:23,226
Well, l must admit, it is kind of catchy.

683
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,758
Dance with me, pa.

684
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,822
It does make you kind of wanna move, doesn't it?

685
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,399
It sure does.

686
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:36,700
Maybe l have been kind of hard on little dewey.

687
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:38,401
Maybe you have.

688
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,005
Be careful, ma.

689
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,751
-you all right, ma? -l'm all right.

690
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:57,290
The vertigo, it won in the end.

691
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:59,723
She lost her balance...

692
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:02,292
...and fell out the window...

693
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,401
...and then the radio crushed her head?

694
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:08,128
While she was dancing to your song.

695
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,139
I thought you should know what your music does.

696
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,105
It kills people.

697
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:16,507
You made her happy and it killed her.

698
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:20,878
If nate was alive, this never would have happened.

699
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,351
Wrong kid died.

700
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:34,259
Damn you, god!

701
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,263
How could you let my mama fall out a window?

702
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:44,901
And then let a radio hit her on the head?

703
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,740
-get out of here, dewey. -what are y'all doing in here?

704
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,882
Lt's called cocaine, and you don't want no part of this shit.

705
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,917
Cocaine?

706
00:40:58,923 --> 00:40:59,890
What's it do?

707
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,752
It turns all your bad feelings into good feelings.

708
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,152
It's a nightmare.

709
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,561
I'm thinking maybe l'd like to try me some of that cocaine.

710
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:14,596
When I meet my maker on my dying day

711
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,467
Look him in the eye and by god I'll say

712
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,508
I gave my word and my word was good

713
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:25,705
I took it in the face and I walked as hard as I could

714
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:29,010
Walk hard walk hard, hard, hard

715
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,017
Walk hard, hard, hard walk....

716
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,159
All right, again. faster.

717
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:41,993
This is crazy, dewey. 

718
00:41:42,363 --> 00:41:43,993
ain't nobody gonna wanna listen to music like this.

719
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:46,362
Standing there playing as fast as you can...

720
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,198
...singing like some sort of punk.

721
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:52,640
Don't you dare try to stifle me.

722
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:56,279
Whose band is this anyway, you cocksucker!

723
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,909
I'll punch you in the mouth!

724
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:02,911
Oh, god. l'm sorry, dave.

725
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,678
No, l didn't mean that.

726
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:11,191
Just with my mama dying and all, l'm just all twisted up inside.

727
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:12,623
Mr. cox?

728
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:16,325
I heard you were looking for a new backup singer. 

729
00:42:16,831 --> 00:42:18,325
for your new duet.

730
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:23,061
You heard right.

731
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:26,534
I was wondering if you might like to give me a try.

732
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,935
I reckon l might.

733
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:35,444
I've been singing in my church choir since l was a girl.

734
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,444
I like the sound of that.

735
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:40,551
Darlene madison.

736
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,389
Dewey cox.

737
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,458
Hello, darlene.

738
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,961
Hello, mr. cox.

739
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,095
You ready to sing one?

740
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,364
I'm always ready.

741
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,070
Well, all right.

742
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:04,080
In my dreams you're blowin' me

743
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:05,771
Some kisses

744
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:12,746
That's one of my favorite things to do

745
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,390
You and I could go down

746
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,062
In history

747
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,298
That's what I'm prayin' to do with you

748
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:28,532
Let's duet

749
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:33,069
In ways that make us feel good

750
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,271
Let's duet

751
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,606
And make that sacred sound

752
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,488
Dewey cox! l am not that kind of woman.

753
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:49,856
-all right. -well...

754
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,722
...that doesn't mean that we still can't be friends.

755
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:55,189
Okay.

756
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:58,924
Well, then, here's to us being great friends.

757
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:04,565
I can't! we're friends!

758
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:08,036
I'm gonna beat off

759
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,109
All my demons

760
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:17,279
That's what lovin' jesus' all about

761
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:23,519
Lookin' in your eyes I start believin'

762
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:30,765
Let's bring this whisper to a shout

763
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:32,998
Let's duet

764
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:37,504
In ways that make us feel good

765
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:41,173
Put two and two together

766
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:44,711
Perfect harmony we've found

767
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:47,940
We know it's only natural

768
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,677
Let's duet

769
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,456
I just wanna make out

770
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:56,353
What you're sayin'

771
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:03,158
Read my lips it's what you're lookin' for

772
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:09,703
Here I am a-sneakin' up behind you

773
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:17,472
You can always come in my back door

774
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:19,239
Let's duet

775
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:31,619
Darlene, these last three weeks have been so...

776
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:34,059
...full and wonderful.

777
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:37,461
We've shared so many activities together as good friends.

778
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:42,196
It's like you understand me the way nobody else ever has.

779
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,334
I mean, if l--

780
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:54,651
-what is it, dewey? -l don't know.

781
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,786
It's nothing. l'm fine.

782
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:59,979
Nothing? you look like you seen a ghost.

783
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:04,291
I got a lot of pain in me, darlene.

784
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:06,424
You should know that.

785
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:09,300
Where does all that pain come from, dewey?

786
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:14,336
Did you ever have something that you really loved...

787
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:18,203
...that you accidentally...

788
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:23,301
...killed, or hurt in some way, with a machete?

789
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,641
-no. -no, me neither.

790
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:26,900
wouldn't that be terrible? 

791
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,700
how would you live with yourself?

792
00:46:28,711 --> 00:46:31,420
I know, right? exactly.

793
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:34,050
Darling darlene

794
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:38,792
Darling darlene

795
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:42,090
I'm in love with you I'm havin' fun with you

796
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:45,393
I'm in love with you I'm on the run with you

797
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:50,733
I'm in love with you and I'll be one with you one day

798
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:58,977
Thanks for letting me sleep in your bunk, dewey.

799
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,946
Gotta sleep somewhere, right?

800
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:06,454
-dewey, l can't. -l know. l know.

801
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:10,719
We both know that the sexual tension between us is palpable.

802
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:12,100
Don't you know 

803
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,530
that l wrestle with the same temptations you do?

804
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:17,165
I know l shouldn't be saying this to you, dewey...

805
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:20,165
...because we're not married and we're just friends...

806
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:23,637
...but sometimes l lie awake at night

807
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,637
aching for a man's touch.

808
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:27,808
And by ''a man's touch,'' 

809
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,808
l mean a penis in my vagina.

810
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:32,777
It's just so silly.

811
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:35,042
Oh, that's so silly.

812
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:38,221
-well, we better get some sleep. -okay.

813
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,517
Take my hand, dewey.

814
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:47,156
Let's promise to never, ever give in to our lesser desires.

815
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:50,162
After all, we're not married.

816
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:00,569
I'm ready for sex.

817
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,850
I been waiting for this for so long.

818
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,249
Me too.

819
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:15,721
From the moment l laid eyes on you.

820
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:35,367
Dewey, l'm nervous.

821
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:40,345
Don't worry, angel. l'll show you the ways of love.

822
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,685
Whoops-a-daisy.

823
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,516
Oh, dewey.

824
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:50,716
Surprise!

825
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:52,552
Edith!

826
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:56,588
-who are you? -l'm his wife, that's who l am.

827
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,030
No, you're not. l'm his--

828
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,205
-good lord, you're already married? -l can explain.

829
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,468
Explain to her? you should explain to me. 

830
00:49:05,807 --> 00:49:07,468
I am the mother of your children.

831
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,771
-lt's not what it looks like. -You have children?

832
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,413
It's not what it looks like.

833
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,140
Not what it looks like to me, or not what it looks like to her?

834
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:17,115
It's gotta be the way it looks like to at least one of us.

835
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:18,413
We're married.

836
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:19,900
I did the right thing.

837
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,581
lt's not like we're not married.

838
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,987
If you're married, you can't get married again.

839
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:27,425
I know, l know, and that was wrong, but it's just....

840
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:30,063
We were such good friends.

841
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:33,259
You told me about that dream where you were licking my balls...

842
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,200
...and that seemed like a signal, and....

843
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:37,497
I forgot.

844
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:41,968
I'm leaving you, dewey cox, and l will see you in court!

845
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:44,306
No, edith! don't go!

846
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:49,011
Oh, well. she's gone now.

847
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:54,252
I'm leaving too. you got the order of things all backwards.

848
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,289
Darlene, don't go!

849
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,222
Edith, don't go either!

850
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:03,861
I made a mistake. l made a terrible mistake.

851
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:07,899
Edith! edith! edith!

852
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:08,900
leave me alone, dewey. 

853
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,699
l never meant no harm to you.

854
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:13,171
Edith. cupcake.

855
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:15,800
Baby, you don't know what it's like out there on the road. 

856
00:50:15,877 --> 00:50:17,279
It's lonely out there.

857
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:19,338
Edith, l can't be alone.

858
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,540
Maybe you should've thought of that 

859
00:50:21,549 --> 00:50:22,985
before you got double married.

860
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:25,648
Is that what this is about?

861
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,856
Don't you stand there and judge me like 

862
00:50:27,856 --> 00:50:29,485
l'm some kind of criminal.

863
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,662
You are a criminal. this is illegal, dewey.

864
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:33,856
What do you mean?

865
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:37,999
It's illegal to be married to two people at the same time, dewey.

866
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:41,103
What about if you're famous? ls that--?

867
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:44,050
You never done nothing you shouldn't have done?

868
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:45,500
What have l ever done to you?

869
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:48,445
You woke up in the middle of the night and drank the milk.

870
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:50,900
I got up to have my cornflakes, there's none left.

871
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:52,580
Dewey, you cheated on me!

872
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:53,500
So l'm a cheater, 

873
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,210
but you can just drink up all the milk.

874
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,586
Okay. all right, that's fine, l get it. 

875
00:50:57,587 --> 00:50:58,900
you're innocent, and l'm guilty.

876
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:01,048
Guilty as charged.

877
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,685
Guilty as charged

878
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,192
Don't you dare write a song right now, dewey!

879
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:10,431
You know what? go ahead. take the children. l don't care.

880
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,491
All l need is my music.

881
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:13,964
I don't need you.

882
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,866
And l don't need you.

883
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,233
And l don't need you.

884
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:19,766
And l don't need you.

885
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:22,945
You're just sitting there all high and mighty in your diaper.

886
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:26,673
If anything, you need me. you're a baby.

887
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:27,906
Come on, miles.

888
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:31,177
Don't you dare take miles.

889
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:35,415
You can take the children, but you leave me my monkey.

890
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:37,426
Fine.

891
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:40,224
Goodbye, dewey cox.

892
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,425
No! no, come back.

893
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:44,591
Don't leave me, edith.

894
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:48,703
Don't leave me, edith.'' there's a title for a song.

895
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:56,601
That's not a bad title, but please don't leave me.

896
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:58,408
What have you done?

897
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:08,824
I'm telling you, l've had it. l've had it with all this crap.

898
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:10,322
You took her side every time.

899
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:12,763
All you care about is fruit and touching yourself. 

900
00:52:13,027 --> 00:52:13,963
well, fuck you.

901
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:17,726
Get out of here. you don't want no part of this.

902
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:19,426

903
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,700
we doing pills, uppers and downers.

904
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,401
They're the logical next step for you.

905
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:25,268
I want some of that shit.

906
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:32,143
Good morning, your honor. may l approach the bench?

907
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,618
I don't give a damn what anyone thinks

908
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:45,588
I stay up all night and I smoke and I drink

909
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:50,763
I'm a wanted man and I'm blowin' town

910
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:53,834
Don't waste your time tryin' to hunt me down

911
00:52:55,939 --> 00:53:00,569
The cops are sayin' I belong behind bars

912
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:02,677
And I'm guilty

913
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:04,870
Guilty

914
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,142
I'm guilty as charged

915
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:12,117
Does dewey seem unhappy to you?

916
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:15,251
He's changed, l tell you, he's changed.

917
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:18,052
That was early dewey, this is middle dewey.

918
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,524
Dewey, are you enjoying yourself?

919
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:25,531
What? oh, l'm sorry. l forgot you were here.

920
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:28,600
Hey, dave. l like your girl better, let's switch.

921
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:32,038

I'm guilty as charged

927
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,151
I ain't askin' god to forgive my sins

928
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,022
Take a good look and you'll know where I've been

929
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,892
I'm dancin' with the devil every night and every day

930
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:59,327
People pay attention to the things that I say

931
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:00,525
Say

932
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,000
Hey, jerry, l'm a long-time listener 

933
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,135
and a first-time caller.

934
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:07,833
Yeah, l just wanted to say l love the show, keep it up.

935
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:09,807
Am l on the radio right now?

936
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:12,975
I'm guilty as charged

937
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:18,845
If you're sayin' my love is too large

938
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:20,113
Then I'm guilty

939
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:25,389
Goddamn it, this is a dark fucking period!

940
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:27,696
Oh, I'm guilty

941
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:29,150
freeze! hands above your head. 

942
00:54:29,197 --> 00:54:30,957
It's not what it looks like.

943
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,294
I'm guilty as charged

944
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:34,492
Stop!

945
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:36,730
You got me.

946
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,773
Come on, mr. cox. how about it? look here.

947
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:47,610
I'm guilty as charged

948
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:59,194
Cox, you got a visitor.

949
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:03,957
Prison has changed me.

950
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:07,493
I understand the common man in a way l never did before.

951
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:10,368
I gotta get out of here

952
00:55:10,772 --> 00:55:13,368
so l can bring joy to the men back in here.

953
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:16,500
But I don't wanna live with them.

954
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:17,808
Lean closer.

955
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,148
I'm going to speak to you in my language...

956
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:26,014
...so that the guards can't understand what l'm saying.

957
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:29,082
There must be something you can do.

958
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:31,590
I'm 21 years old.

959
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:34,525
I got my whole life ahead of me....

960
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:38,360
We think we can get you off.

961
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:40,200
What do l have to do?

962
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:42,932
You gotta go to rehab.

963
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:45,368
-''rehab''? -rehab.

964
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:51,577
-rehab? -oh, rehab. okay, okay, l gotcha.

965
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:55,911
Doctor! doctor!

966
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,384
-l'm so cold. -we need more blankets.

967
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:01,147
We need more blankets.

968
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:03,515
Doctor!

969
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,594
-l'm so hot! -l think he has too many blankets.

970
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:07,820
Fewer blankets!

971
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:10,793
I'm hot and cold at the same time!

972
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
He needs more blankets and he needs less blankets.

973
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,799
I'm afraid you're right.

974
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,199
Dewey?

975
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,667
My wife sends her love...

976
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,104
...asshole.

977
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:25,873
Dewey, tall and powerful

978
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:30,749
Dewey, l don't know if you can hear me in there...

979
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:34,817
...but the wrong kid died.

980
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,289
Dewey. do you mind if we get stoned in here?

981
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:43,023
He can't hear you. he's gonna die anyway.

982
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:04,316
Are you ready to go home, dewey cox?

983
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,253
Darlene.

984
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,888
I could never get you out of my head.

985
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:14,853
Me neither.

986
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:17,294
I could never stop thinking about you.

987
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,264
But l wasn't gonna be no home wrecker.

988
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:24,907
Now that l'm your only wife though, it seems different.

989
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:29,977
I'm a new man, darlene. prison and rehab have changed me.

990
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:33,247
All these blankets have saved my life.

991
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:37,317
I think you're finally ready to be the man l always thought you could be.

992
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,987
Let me get this off.

993
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,435
I love you.

994
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:28,695
I love you too.

995
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:41,916
Oh, my god.

996
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:52,052
Oh, don't stop.

997
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:55,629
Don't stop. don't stop, dewey.

998
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:57,322
Oh, god.

999
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,932
Oh, yes!

1000
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:14,682
Hey, boys, have you seen dewey?

1001
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,409
I think l saw him in the barn with wavy gravy

1002
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,485
I saw him by the creek talking to donovan.

1003
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:23,284
No, l think he was painting a portrait with joni mitchell.

1004
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:30,933
Jerry garcia, brother, have you seen dewey?

1005
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:33,500
L think l saw him in the study, sister darlene.

1006
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:10,000


1007
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:25,000


1008
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:35,364
Thanks, jerry garcia.

1009
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:40,500
Hey! casey, jones, watch your speed.

1010
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:49,178
Come on, dewey. lt's almost time for dewman's cake.

1011
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:53,913
All right. lt's just-- lt's hard for me to sit around at some birthday party...

1012
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:57,149
...when l know there's so much injustice going on in this world.

1013
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,453
-l know. -my daddy was right.

1014
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:02,392
L can't spend all my time thinking about dewey cox no more.

1015
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,430
L've got to think about the other people.

1016
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:05,925
Like your family?

1017
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:11,367
No, l mean, like, people that's having injustices done to them.

1018
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:13,834
Like women and midgets and such.

1019
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:17,535
L mean, it's 1 966, darlene. and, baby...

1020
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,440
...l'm feeling it.

1021
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:26,252
L know. the '60s are an important and exciting time.

1022
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,755
Aren't they? lt's like there's something happening here.

1023
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:33,588
And what it is ain't exactly...

1024
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:36,253
...obvious.

1025
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,128
L have to try to help people with my music.

1026
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:43,396
Some people are saying that your new music sounds a lot like bob dylan.

1027
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:45,700
Well, maybe bob dylan sounds a lot like me.

1028
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:47,504
How come nobody

1029
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,610
Why you sound so much like dewey cox?''

1030
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:55,307
Mailboxes drip like lampposts in the twisted birth canal of the coliseum

1031
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:01,423
Rimjob fairy teapots mask the temper tantrum

1032
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:03,751
Oh, say can you see 'em?

1033
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:08,763
Stuffed cabbage is the darling of the laundromat

1034
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:13,635
The mouse with the overbite explained how the rabbits were ensnared

1035
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,267
What the hell is this song about?

1036
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:18,064
L have no idea.

1037
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:22,574
You guys are idiots. this song is very deep.

1038
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:29,184
Inside the three-eyed monkey within inches of his toaster-oven life

1039
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:31,785
What do your parents think about your protest songs?

1040
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:35,355
What do your parents think about my protest songs, mr. time magazine?

1041
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:40,361
All the elevator buttons

1042
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:44,358
So incredibly high

1043
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:47,559
I stand today for the midget

1044
01:01:48,337 --> 01:01:51,829
Half the size of a regular guy

1045
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:56,370
Let me hold you, little man

1046
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:59,571
As the parade passes by

1047
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:03,579
Let me hold you, little man

1048
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,412
We'll make believe you can fly

1049
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:11,352
You shout for me to put you down

1050
01:02:11,428 --> 01:02:14,953
But I'm marching today for your cause

1051
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:18,998
I'm banging the drum your big day will come

1052
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:21,796
When they remake the wizard of oz

1053
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:28,537
So let me hold you, midget man

1054
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:32,379
Pretend that you're flying in space

1055
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:36,245
Let me hold you, midget man

1056
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:39,250
So the dog will stop licking your face

1057
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:41,750
Sing with me!

1058
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:44,550
Sing it!

1059
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,752
Mr. cox, why are you going to lndia?

1060
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:50,865
Well, l'm searching for something, if you must know.

1061
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:53,535
L'm fixing to do some meditating with the maharishi.

1062
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:56,204
And dewey cox needs lndia right now...

1063
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:59,397
...and, heck, l reckon lndia needs dewey cox too.

1064
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:06,805
Only through meditation can we begin to understand our role.

1065
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:11,083
We're nothing but grains of sand.

1066
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,687
That was freaking transcendental, paul mccartney.

1067
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:16,256
-don't you agree, john lennon? -yes, dewey cox.

1068
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:19,822
With meditation there's no limit to what we can...

1069
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:21,394
...imagine.

1070
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:23,394
What do you think, george harrison?

1071
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:27,296
L don't know. l'm just trying to get some more songs on the album, you know.

1072
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:30,768
And as ringo starr, l'm not so interested in meditation.

1073
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:33,032
L just like to have fun.

1074
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:36,645
-l like the little one. -lt's so dark in this tent.

1075
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:40,304
Reminds me when we, the beatles, the four beatles, us--

1076
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:42,609
-from liverpool. -yes, we are from liverpool.

1077
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,808
We used to play those dark clubs in hamburg. 

1078
01:03:45,819 --> 01:03:46,778
Remember that, paul?

1079
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:51,289
Of course l do, l booked them. l'm the leader of the beatles.

1080
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:54,520
Well, l have to say l like your stuff. lt's pretty good.

1081
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,994
And most of your records, l really enjoy.

1082
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,100
We're big fans of your records too.

1083
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:02,328
We like to think that hard day's night is our guilty as charged.

1084
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:04,472
-great record. -excellent album.

1085
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,665
-we learned a lot from you. -great record.

1086
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:08,503
-we're big fans of y'all. -huge fans.

1087
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:11,305
You're almost as good as the monkees. you guys are great.

1088
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:16,477
L think l might adjourn to another dimension, take some lsd.

1089
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,086
-do you care to join me? -yeah, let's do that.

1090
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:21,756
Care to join us for some lsd? lt's good for you.

1091
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:25,325
-built by scientists, it is. -lysergic.

1092
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:27,589
Gotta check with headquarters.

1093
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:29,992
Come on, dewey cox. think you might enjoy it.

1094
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:33,691
Open your mind to a new experience, a new level of consciousness...

1095
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:35,768
...like we do, because we are the beatles.

1096
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:38,634
Why not let him decide. lf he wants to take lsd, he'll take it.

1097
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:41,036
He doesn't have to listen to you. you're not the boss of him.

1098
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:43,804
Don't tell me what to say and what not to say, paul mccartney.

1099
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:48,347
L'm sick of you being so dark when l'm so impish and whimsical. l'm sick of it.

1100
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:51,748
Hey, everyone, we got a brand new mansion.

1101
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:53,512
Paul's a big fat cunt.

1102
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:56,055
Don't know why you don't let me write more songs.

1103
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:59,660
You know, l just sit here while me guitar quietly whimpers, you know.

1104
01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:02,456
You are the quiet one, so why don't you shut the fuck up?

1105
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:04,360
L've got a song about an octopus.

1106
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,502
Jam it up your ass. you're lucky we still let you play drums.

1107
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:11,469
Wow, seems like there's a rift happening between the beatles.

1108
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:14,666
L wonder if your songs will still be shit when l'm 64.

1109
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:16,310
-great sod. -no, stop it!

1110
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:17,843
You bastard! you sissy.

1111
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:21,312
Beatles. please stop fighting here in lndia.

1112
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:23,508
No, no, let them go. let them work it out.

1113
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:24,708
Taste it.

1114
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,513
Right there in the bollocks.

1115
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:29,251
-bastard! -cunt!

1116
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,890
Dewey, you been living clean for three years now...

1117
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,325
...and it's done you a world of good, has it not?

1118
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:37,624
L know l've had trouble with drugs in the past.

1119
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:42,395
But l'm addicted to coke, weed, booze, ludes and speed. not lsd.

1120
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,971
Nobody gets addicted to lsd.

1121
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:48,007
Lt was invented by scientists. ringo starr just told me.

1122
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:51,008
L heard that doing lsd can awaken your demons.

1123
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:55,139
L ain't got no demons gonna get woke.

1124
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:59,854
Lf you promise it'll just be this one time.

1125
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:03,482
Okay.

1126
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:06,426
Let's go drop acid with the beatles.

1127
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,097
Hello, dewey.

1128
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:21,037
Welcome to your lsd trip.

1129
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:23,541
Where everything's a cartoon.

1130
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:26,306
We're the trippy cartoon beatles.

1131
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:29,075
Look at that. lt's a flying fish.

1132
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:30,980
Totally trippy!

1133
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:34,688
Wow, this lsd's all right.

1134
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,983
L like being a trippy cartoon.

1135
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:39,753
Just keep thinking happy thoughts, dewey.

1136
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:43,090
L'd hate for this to turn into a bad trip.

1137
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:46,692
What's that scary music?

1138
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:50,031
L had an unhappy thought.

1139
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,672
Lt's a bad trip.

1140
01:06:51,874 --> 01:06:53,364
Bad trip, bad trip!

1141
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:56,511
Help! trippy machete!

1142
01:06:57,613 --> 01:07:00,673
Oh, fuck me. l can see my large colon.

1143
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:03,782
L guess l do have some demons.

1144
01:07:03,986 --> 01:07:05,476
You all right, cox?

1145
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:06,950
L don't know.

1146
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:09,590
Do you want some more lsd?

1147
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:12,625
Yeah. l think l do.

1148
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:22,733
Mr. schwartzberg, you're his long-time manager. maybe you can talk to him.

1149
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:24,633
Well, what's the problem?

1150
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,400
He's been on that trampoline for four days.

1151
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:30,636
You have got to talk some sense into him. l'm worried.

1152
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:36,613
Dewey, as your manager, l have to tell you l'm concerned.

1153
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:38,980
L think the lsd has changed you.

1154
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:42,749
Lt has changed me. lt's opened my mind right up.

1155
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:44,425
L'm reinventing music.

1156
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:47,687
L'm creating something new that l call ''shmusic.''

1157
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,389
You've recorded the same song for eight months. 

1158
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:51,389
you're not close to finished.

1159
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,228
Because this record is different than any other l've made.

1160
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:56,871
L told you. this is going to be my masterpiece.

1161
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,303
The one l'm remembered by. lt's for my brother.

1162
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:00,633
What brother?

1163
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:03,311
Nothing. never mind. lt's private.

1164
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:06,276
L've got this sound in my head and it's trying to get out.

1165
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:10,043
L can't find it on this human plane of existence. l've got to keep on searching.

1166
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:14,850
But l'll tell you what, l'm gonna find it.

1167
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:25,594
You guys should make friends. he's a wonderful man.

1168
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:29,259
Professor, good morning. all right, everyone. thank you.

1169
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:31,831
L've just been outside, l had a little bounce.

1170
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:35,033
What we're going to do is run through the entire piece...

1171
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:37,144
...in our minds, silently.

1172
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:39,314
And...

1173
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:40,846
...begin.

1174
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:43,712
As we sit here together on thanksgiving...

1175
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:45,682
...on our beautiful trampoline...

1176
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:50,018
...l think we should take a moment to think about what it's like to be a turkey.

1177
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:53,057
Gobble, gobble, gobble. gobble, gobble, gobble.

1178
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:55,093
hi, l'm just a little turkey.''

1179
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:57,822
Just cut the damn bird, boy.

1180
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:02,335
Dewey? can we just enjoy our thanksgiving dinner?

1181
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:07,134
You think you're so great sitting there all drugged up...

1182
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:09,140
...on your trampoline.

1183
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:11,540
You're the black sheep of this family.

1184
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:13,745
You call yourself a cox.

1185
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:15,849
Until you get right with jesus...

1186
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:20,010
...you'll never be nothing but a big, black cox.

1187
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:25,719
Nothing l do will ever please you, will it?

1188
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:30,096
We're both cox, pa. both of us are cox.

1189
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:33,700
L've got 1 3 7 musicians waiting on me.

1190
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:35,894
You'll have to excuse me.

1191
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,936
Dewey, watch the turkey.

1192
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:46,704
I wasn't dreaming

1193
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:48,543
Barely awake

1194
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:52,584
Off to the grinder we stroll

1195
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:55,288
This is not a good song.

1196
01:09:55,724 --> 01:09:58,989
Lt's like five songs on top of each other at the same time.

1197
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,925
Not even a song. lt's some kind of concerto.

1198
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:03,392
Just let him work it out.

1199
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:06,128
Masterpieces take time.

1200
01:10:07,336 --> 01:10:09,361
Do you hear that? that goat's been singing...

1201
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:11,972
...more than l am on this damn song.

1202
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:18,672
Well?

1203
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,679
That was beautiful, dewey. lt was perfection.

1204
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:24,478
Yeah, even the goat was perfect.

1205
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:27,212
Yeah, the goat was good. were the strings tangy enough?

1206
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:29,414
Oh, they were tangy. they were very tangy.

1207
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:31,320
Unbelievably tangy.

1208
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:34,496
No, guys, the strings were not tangy! they were salty!

1209
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:36,221
Am l crazy?

1210
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:38,957
Let's do one more time. okay, strings, lean into it.

1211
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:42,001
L want it really tangy this time. now, mike, you're flatting.

1212
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:46,197
Bushmen, make it sound like you're in the fucking bush, okay?

1213
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:48,501
Back off the goat on the second pre-chorus.

1214
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:50,474
L wanna hear his heart, not his soul.

1215
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:53,546
Sam, go back to that thing you did yesterday on the bridge.

1216
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:57,014
-what did l do? -lt sounded like velvet pancakes.

1217
01:10:57,219 --> 01:10:59,881
-yeah, right. -okay, everybody, one more time.

1218
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:02,353
What on earth is a velvet pancake?

1219
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:07,325
Lt's the lsd. l think it's having an effect on him.

1220
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:10,396
From the top of the overture. slate it.

1221
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:13,860
black sheep,'' take 1 1 2.

1222
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:17,163
1 2 3 5 6 7 8
One, and a two, and a five, six, seven, eight.

1223
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:22,809
I just close my eyes when I fantasize

1224
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:26,243
Much to my surprise I'm only half the size

1225
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:28,313
That I used to be

1226
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:33,517
Bye-bye, white brother

1227
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:37,317
This black sheep gotta roll

1228
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:39,653
Lt's on the beat!

1229
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,897
I just open up like a catacomb

1230
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:46,932
Though my heart is half from the half-f tone

1231
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:49,636
That tickles.

1232
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:55,033
Bye-bye, pastures of plenty

1233
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:58,842
I don't know where I will

1234
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:01,676
-roam -black sheep, black sheep

1235
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:04,412
Like that, with some urgency.

1236
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:08,056
Not, ''l'm in the yard. l wanna go outside.''

1237
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:12,694
Like, ''l'm about to die.'' like that.

1238
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:14,624
The blade has been swung

1239
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:17,594
Black sheep, black sheep

1240
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:21,635
All right? here we go.

1241
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:25,297
Push. push, baby, push.

1242
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:27,275
-are we recording this? -no.

1243
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:30,741
Well, we should be. get a microphone. push, baby.

1244
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:32,311
Push.

1245
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:34,607
Push! push!

1246
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:39,785
I'm losin' my fleece from tryin'

1247
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:43,287
I'm losin' no sleep I'm dyin'

1248
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:47,655
Why shouldn't I keep from cryin'?

1249
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:50,523
Cryin'

1250
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:54,032
I'm losin' my fleece from tryin'

1251
01:12:54,236 --> 01:12:57,569
I'm losin' no sleep I'm dyin'

1252
01:12:57,773 --> 01:13:01,072
Why shouldn't I keep from cry--?

1253
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:08,406
Lt's still not finished yet.

1254
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:12,611
L'm hearing more aboriginal percussionists.

1255
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:17,454
And l want an army of didgeridoos. fifty thousand didgeridoos!

1256
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:19,718
Folks, can we have a moment with dewey?

1257
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:25,026
What the hell are these songs about?

1258
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,532
You're singing about cutting people in half--

1259
01:13:29,104 --> 01:13:32,631
L'm working something out. lt's called a metaphor.

1260
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:34,274
Well, what are you working out?

1261
01:13:34,476 --> 01:13:36,774
Lt's secret. that's why it's called metaphor.

1262
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:38,708
That's what metaphor means. secret.

1263
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:42,012
L just don't see why you gotta throw away the recipe, is all.

1264
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:46,313
Why don't we just go in there, lay down some tracks like we always done?

1265
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:49,082
Yeah, why can't we just walk hard?

1266
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:51,122
What do we need all these people for?

1267
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:54,921
L don't need people around me stifling me.

1268
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:58,463
So if you don't like it, there's the door.

1269
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:01,191
Dewey?

1270
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:04,098
Are you saying you don't need us no more?

1271
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:10,040
Not unless you can open your mind and learn to play the fucking theremin.

1272
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:13,976
Fuck you, dewey!

1273
01:14:14,516 --> 01:14:16,780
Yeah, fuck you, dewey.

1274
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:19,545
Ln 20 years not once have you thrown a woman on my way.

1275
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:22,087
You don't think we like cheating on our wives too?

1276
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,700
And you never once paid for drugs. 

1277
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:25,283
not once!

1278
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:28,463
You pay that chimp more than you pay us.

1279
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:31,497
L had to borrow from the chimp to get a mortgage on my house.

1280
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:35,898
And those stupid siamese glass cats you get us every year for christmas.

1281
01:14:36,104 --> 01:14:38,937
L don't want any more siamese glass cats!

1282
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:42,133
The siamese cat is a symbol of nobility in ancient egypt.

1283
01:14:42,344 --> 01:14:43,333
Fuck nobility!

1284
01:14:43,545 --> 01:14:45,410
Fuck ancient egypt.

1285
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:47,313
Fuck cats!

1286
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:49,984
And you never paid for drugs.

1287
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:51,650
Not once.

1288
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:53,481
You slept with my wife.

1289
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:54,883
You slept with me too!

1290
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:58,321
And l've had confused feelings about that for 1 0 years now!

1291
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:00,927
And you never once paid for drugs.

1292
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:03,298
Not once.

1293
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:05,626
You're on your own, dewey cox.

1294
01:15:06,268 --> 01:15:07,360
We're leaving.

1295
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:12,800
Well, l guess this is the end of a chapter in your life, 

1296
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,067
Dewey cox.

1297
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:30,382
What's happened to you, dewey cox?

1298
01:15:30,592 --> 01:15:31,923
Stay out of this, darlene!

1299
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:34,595
You're driving away the people who love you most!

1300
01:15:34,796 --> 01:15:36,821
L don't need anybody, darlene.

1301
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,099
All l need is my music.

1302
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:44,396
This ain't about your music, dewey. lt's about the drugs.

1303
01:15:44,606 --> 01:15:47,336
Honey, l told you l'm gonna quit again.

1304
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:49,836
As soon as the record's done. whenever that is.

1305
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:51,740
Look, you can't rush a masterpiece.

1306
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:58,514
You need to take a break. you need to clean yourself up, otherwise--

1307
01:15:58,720 --> 01:15:59,914
Otherwise what?

1308
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:02,590
Otherwise l can't be married to you no more.

1309
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:05,999
L know you don't mean that.

1310
01:16:06,161 --> 01:16:08,220
L believe you know that l do.

1311
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:14,730
Okay.

1312
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:18,639
-okay? -okay.

1313
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:20,768
You'll take a break?

1314
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:23,074
L will take a break.

1315
01:16:23,478 --> 01:16:24,911
And you'll quit the drugs?

1316
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:27,679
And l will quit the drugs.

1317
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:29,978
Dewey!

1318
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:35,356
Oh, baby. l've been praying about this day for so long.

1319
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:38,357
-what did you just put in your mouth? -gum.

1320
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:42,292
-you ain't chewing no gum. -candy?

1321
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:45,398
-what did you put in your mouth? -lt's pcp.

1322
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,796
Oh, you just said--!

1323
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:53,069
L'm going to town!

1324
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:01,115
Get out of the road, you jerk!

1325
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:05,744
Hey! what's going on?

1326
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:17,665
There he is!

1327
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:27,098
Dewey! get off that building! lt's inappropriate!

1328
01:17:29,544 --> 01:17:33,878
Dewey cox, you give me no choice.

1329
01:17:34,082 --> 01:17:38,951
Lt breaks my heart, but l'm leaving you.

1330
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,416
L'm zeus!

1331
01:17:42,924 --> 01:17:45,950
No mortal can stop me! l'm zeus!

1332
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:52,097
-rehab? -rehab.

1333
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:03,166
Nate!

1334
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:08,807
Nate?

1335
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:11,178
This is what l'd look like if l'd grown up...

1336
01:18:11,753 --> 01:18:14,085
...and perhaps hadn't been murdered, or whatever.

1337
01:18:14,589 --> 01:18:18,081
L just came to tell you you need to get your shit together!

1338
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:19,783
L know.

1339
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:21,462
L've fallen again.

1340
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:23,961
Listen to yourself. whining like a little bitch.

1341
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:25,500
Lf l was alive right now, 

1342
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,863
l'd be the fucking president of the united states.

1343
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:31,164
L'd be on the moon, walking around looking for aliens to kill.

1344
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:31,888
what? 

1345
01:18:31,888 --> 01:18:34,035
You know why dad liked me better?

1346
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:36,039
Because l was better than you.

1347
01:18:36,244 --> 01:18:37,542
When l played the piano, 

1348
01:18:37,555 --> 01:18:38,542
l was fucking awesome.

1349
01:18:38,747 --> 01:18:40,715
Well, you think it's been easy for me?

1350
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:42,907
Since you're gone l got no sense of smell.

1351
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:44,779
Oh, you got no sense of smell?

1352
01:18:45,687 --> 01:18:49,123
You can't smell anything? you can't smell anything?

1353
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:51,758
L got no sense of having legs, dewey!

1354
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:55,191
L have no life! l'm dead because somebody...

1355
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:57,422
...l'm not gonna point out names right now...

1356
01:18:57,632 --> 01:18:59,497
...decided to murder me with a machete.

1357
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:02,431
-nate. -l can't even smell, touch, feel.

1358
01:19:02,637 --> 01:19:05,800
L can't even masturbate. you ever try to jerk off with a ghost hand? 

1359
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:06,539
Nothing!

1360
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:11,211
L'm just trying to say you need to fix this shit.

1361
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:14,678
You need to get out of that bathtub. start writing songs again.

1362
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:22,120
Ls he almost done thinking about his life?

1363
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:25,020
He just reached the '70s.

1364
01:19:43,345 --> 01:19:44,999
Schwartzy, l don't know.

1365
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,140
l don't know, l don't know what's going on with me.

1366
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:48,411
L got the song block.

1367
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:49,641
Song block.

1368
01:19:49,851 --> 01:19:51,842
L don't need to write any new songs.

1369
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:53,111
L'll just do my old ones.

1370
01:19:53,111 --> 01:19:54,111
we'll do a oldies tour

1371
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:55,489
l'll do ''walk hard.''

1372
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:58,700
Dewey, ''walk hard'' is over 20 years old.

1373
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:01,200
Well, a lot of people like my old songs.

1374
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:03,555
Old people like your old songs.

1375
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:04,999
May l make a suggestion?

1376
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:07,058
Are you familiar with the donny & marie show?

1377
01:20:07,269 --> 01:20:10,466
-the television show? -l got a call from cbs.

1378
01:20:10,672 --> 01:20:13,400
They wanna do the same kind of show with you.

1379
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:17,140
L'm a serious musician. l'm not some tv personality.

1380
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:18,888
Well, why can't you be both? 

1381
01:20:18,888 --> 01:20:20,888
Look at those goofy bastards on hee haw.

1382
01:20:21,049 --> 01:20:22,555
Well, l do love hee haw.

1383
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,779
Television, dewey. lt's the way into the people's hearts.

1384
01:20:26,421 --> 01:20:29,447
All right. you call them back today...

1385
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:32,024
...and you tell mr. cbs...

1386
01:20:32,227 --> 01:20:35,788
...that l will do it if l have total creative control.

1387
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:38,557
Dewey, you can't have any creative control.

1388
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:41,565
Okay.

1389
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:44,739
All right, let's just do it then. fuck it, let's do it.

1390
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,268
L'm bored.

1391
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:50,202
Live from burbank, california.

1392
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:52,346
It's the dewey cox show.

1393
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:57,610
And now your host, dewey cox!

1394
01:20:57,819 --> 01:20:59,912
-walk hard -hard

1395
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:01,645
-hard -hard

1396
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:04,951
Down life's rocky road

1397
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:07,720
-walk bold -bold

1398
01:21:07,929 --> 01:21:09,294
-hard -hard

1399
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:11,465
That's my creed

1400
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:13,497
My code

1401
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:15,761
I been scorned and slandered and ridiculed too

1402
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:19,636
Had to suffer every day my whole life through

1403
01:21:21,343 --> 01:21:23,641
Seen my share of the worst that the world can give

1404
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,772
But I still got a dream and a burnin' rage to live

1405
01:21:29,184 --> 01:21:31,516
Walk hard

1406
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:34,244
Walk hard

1407
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:38,659
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. welcome to the show.

1408
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:40,088
We've got a great one for you tonight.

1409
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:43,093
To get things rolling, l'd like to bring out my first guest...

1410
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:47,701

1413
01:21:56,478 --> 01:22:00,710
Cheryl, you know, you remind me of a 1 9 7 7 corvette.

1414
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,042
Why is that?

1415
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:04,115
Because you're a beautiful new model.

1416
01:22:07,822 --> 01:22:09,050
Just kidding.

1417
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:16,527
Would you do me the honor of joining me for a song?

1418
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:19,359
Well, l thought you'd never ask, mr. cox.

1419
01:22:22,003 --> 01:22:25,837
Baby, come as you are with just your heart

And I'll take you in

You're rejected and hurt

1422
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:37,512
To me you're worth what you have within

1423
01:22:38,053 --> 01:22:41,454
You don't have to be a star, baby

1424
01:22:42,357 --> 01:22:44,825

Oh, my god, your show is such a hit. 

1440
01:23:43,682 --> 01:23:44,900
You beat mccloud last week.

1441
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:46,900
Well, thank you, morgan fairchild, 

1442
01:23:46,919 --> 01:23:48,514
You know l never pay attention to the ratings.

1443
01:23:48,723 --> 01:23:49,555
Just kidding. 

1444
01:23:49,555 --> 01:23:51,580

1445
01:23:51,593 --> 01:23:53,151

Hey, you. are you gonna save a dance for me, dewey?

1447
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:59,800
Well, you bet, cheryl ladd from charlie's angels.

1448
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:01,935
Hey there, little miss cox-tiegs.

1449
01:24:02,137 --> 01:24:04,105
Have you met my new wife, cheryl cox-tiegs?

1450
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:06,296
We've met, yes.

1451
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:08,703
Lsn't that funny? you're both named cheryl.

1452
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:11,140
Yeah. we're aware of that.

1453
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:13,938
That is hilarious.

1454
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:17,616
Hey, hey who wants to party?

1455
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:20,117
L don't know what they're talking about with this energy crisis.

1456
01:24:20,321 --> 01:24:23,586
Because l have plenty of energy, all right? l am loaded with energy.

1457
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:28,185
Look, l gave up politics a long time ago.

1458
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:31,832
You know, let somebody else march. l wanna play frisbee.

1459
01:24:32,367 --> 01:24:35,427
L'm on the beach. l'm not marching on the beach.

1460
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:37,969
Billy, don't be a hero

1461
01:24:38,173 --> 01:24:41,142
Don't be a fool with your life

1462
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:46,313
Do me, dewey.

1463
01:24:50,852 --> 01:24:53,946
L can't, cheryl ladd, l'm married to cheryl tiegs.

1464
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:57,215
Oh, l should've been your guest star last week instead of her.

1465
01:24:57,425 --> 01:24:59,791
Lt could've been me.

1466
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:02,491
lt could've been me.''

1467
01:25:02,697 --> 01:25:06,428
It could have been me could've been me

1468
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:08,226
Stay in it. stay in it.

1469
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:16,103
It could've been me

1470
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:19,710
Rocky ro..

1471
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:23,179
No! you're repeating yourself!

1472
01:25:24,385 --> 01:25:27,843
Why can't l write a fucking song anymore?

1473
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:31,556
I love the nightlife I got to boogie

1474
01:25:31,759 --> 01:25:34,557
On the disco 'round

1475
01:25:36,197 --> 01:25:39,030
I told you I love the nightlife

1476
01:25:39,234 --> 01:25:40,496
I got to boogie

1477
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:44,194
On the disco 'round oh, yeah

1478
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:47,772
L'll tell you, l've never been so truly satisfied.

1479
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:50,945
Living here in this beautiful beach house with you...

1480
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:53,637
...my beautiful cheryl cox-tiegs.

1481
01:25:53,848 --> 01:25:56,976
The ratings are great. these are the salad days.

1482
01:25:57,185 --> 01:26:01,781
Yeah, l've been looking for something my whole life, and this is it.

1483
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:04,888
L'm finally truly satisfied.

1484
01:26:10,398 --> 01:26:14,061
Goodbye, love

1485
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:18,294
Goodbye, love

1486
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:22,340
You are not going home. you are sleeping in the guestroom.

1487
01:26:22,544 --> 01:26:24,239
Forever.

1488
01:26:24,445 --> 01:26:26,470
Because you're the only one who stuck around.

1489
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:28,672
Everyone else got sick of it and left...

1490
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:31,579
...but you stuck around, which means you're my friend.

1491
01:26:37,425 --> 01:26:41,327
There's a starman waiting in the sky

1492
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:43,258
He'd like to come and meet us

1493
01:26:43,464 --> 01:26:45,125
But he thinks he'd blow our minds

1494
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:49,497
There's a starman waiting in the sky

1495
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:53,196
He's told us not to blow it cause he knows it's all worthwhile

1496
01:26:53,408 --> 01:26:54,602
He told me

1497
01:26:54,809 --> 01:26:58,108
Let the children use it let the children lose it

1498
01:26:58,313 --> 01:27:00,474
Let all the children boogie

1499
01:27:00,748 --> 01:27:02,978
Goddamn it!

1500
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:06,333
L mean, what do l have to do to get you on my bone?

1501
01:27:06,333 --> 01:27:07,144
lnvent fire?

1502
01:27:07,355 --> 01:27:09,882
And then huge laugh and we go to commercial. 

1503
01:27:09,888 --> 01:27:10,882
all right, take five.

1504
01:27:13,528 --> 01:27:15,553
Great rehearsal, dewey. very funny sketch.

1505
01:27:15,763 --> 01:27:17,856
Thank you. have you seen the ratings?

1506
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:20,660
We're getting our ass kicked by the incredible hulk.

1507
01:27:20,868 --> 01:27:23,860
Well, last night's episode was a very special episode.

1508
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,973
They revealed that the lncredible hulk has an evil twin.

1509
01:27:27,175 --> 01:27:28,836
And he's not green. he's red.

1510
01:27:29,043 --> 01:27:31,136
L know. lt was amazing. did you see it?

1511
01:27:31,346 --> 01:27:32,338
You can't compete with that. 

1512
01:27:32,346 --> 01:27:34,338
But we do need to do more promotion.

1513
01:27:34,549 --> 01:27:35,500
Here's what we'll do. 

1514
01:27:35,549 --> 01:27:38,212
We'll introduce people to the new dewey cox.

1515
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:40,419
L got a girl here to interview you. 

1516
01:27:40,419 --> 01:27:42,321
She's from the local affiliate in dallas.

1517
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:46,523
L don't know. l'm not so good on interviews.

1518
01:27:46,728 --> 01:27:48,992
Bubbe, it's a puff piece. lt's very puffy.

1519
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:51,165
All you have to do is remind the audience...

1520
01:27:51,366 --> 01:27:53,200
...you're not mainlining acid anymore. 

1521
01:27:53,366 --> 01:27:55,200
And the show, it's a lot of fun, right?

1522
01:27:55,403 --> 01:27:56,563
-you're having fun. -yeah.

1523
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:59,239
Lt's on every thursday night after the local news.

1524
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,308
Lt's on every thursday night after your local news. 

1525
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,308
l'm not mainlining acid.''

1526
01:28:03,511 --> 01:28:05,638
-anymore. -oh, l'm not gonna promise that.

1527
01:28:05,847 --> 01:28:07,555
Whatever you're comfortable with.

1528
01:28:07,555 --> 01:28:09,044
l don't smoke angel dust anymore.

1529
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:11,333
So don't be afraid.'' something like that?

1530
01:28:11,486 --> 01:28:13,886
Why don't you tell us about your new tv program?

1531
01:28:14,088 --> 01:28:15,852
Gail, it's a variety show. 

1532
01:28:15,852 --> 01:28:16,852
l do a little bit of everything.

1533
01:28:17,058 --> 01:28:19,822
L do some singing, some dancing, chatting with the guests...

1534
01:28:20,028 --> 01:28:22,121
...the skits, the monologues, the comedy.

1535
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:23,888
Wonderful. comedy.

1536
01:28:24,098 --> 01:28:26,498
Lt really is a lot of fun.

1537
01:28:26,701 --> 01:28:30,569
We'll have more fun when we come back from this word from our sponsors.

1538
01:28:30,772 --> 01:28:32,103
Don't go away.

1539
01:28:34,142 --> 01:28:36,140
Okay, you know what, l gotta tell you

1540
01:28:36,142 --> 01:28:37,839
My heart goes out to you.

1541
01:28:38,046 --> 01:28:41,413
L know what it's like to be on a piece-of-shit television program...

1542
01:28:41,616 --> 01:28:44,585
-...because l'm hosting one right now. -excuse me?

1543
01:28:44,786 --> 01:28:47,880
Must wanna blow your fucking brains out, l'll bet. l know l do.

1544
01:28:49,223 --> 01:28:51,214
And we're back with mr. dewey cox.

1545
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:53,917
We're talking about the fun he's having on his show.

1546
01:28:54,128 --> 01:28:57,128
But right now, let's talk about your lovely wife, darlene. 

1547
01:28:57,128 --> 01:28:58,360
How's she doing?

1548
01:28:58,766 --> 01:29:01,030
Darlene and l separated some years ago, gail.

1549
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:03,567
Oh, okay. guess l didn't do my homework.

1550
01:29:03,771 --> 01:29:06,035
And to answer your question, l miss her terribly.

1551
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,502
Well, that's sweet.

1552
01:29:07,709 --> 01:29:09,709
Why don't we talk about your parents? 

1553
01:29:09,709 --> 01:29:10,872
They've gotta be proud of you.

1554
01:29:11,412 --> 01:29:13,403
Well, my mom is dead.

1555
01:29:13,614 --> 01:29:18,449
And my pa and l don't speak to each other...

1556
01:29:18,653 --> 01:29:20,780
...so we're not very close.

1557
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:25,216
We can always cut around this if it gets too pathetic.

1558
01:29:25,426 --> 01:29:28,554
Tell us about your kids. l know you got a whole slew of them.

1559
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:31,487
L'm locked in a custody battle at this time.

1560
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:33,600
Custody is being forced upon me, 

1561
01:29:33,699 --> 01:29:34,600
which l don't think is right.

1562
01:29:34,802 --> 01:29:37,794
You know, if you don't want the responsibility of children...

1563
01:29:38,005 --> 01:29:39,973
...you should be able to walk away...

1564
01:29:40,174 --> 01:29:44,406
...and apparently a couple of my ex-wives don't feel the same. so, yeah.

1565
01:29:44,612 --> 01:29:45,612
Wherever my kids are, 

1566
01:29:45,612 --> 01:29:47,080
they're watching the dewey cox show...

1567
01:29:47,281 --> 01:29:50,114
...on thursday nights at 8:00, right after the local news.

1568
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:52,781
And l just wanted to say to everyone out there...

1569
01:29:52,987 --> 01:29:55,785
...l'm no longer mainlining acid or smoking pcp.

1570
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:57,480
Lt's official.

1571
01:29:58,593 --> 01:30:01,653
Okay. why don't we lighten it up just a bit here?

1572
01:30:01,863 --> 01:30:03,959
You're so busy, dewey cox 

1573
01:30:03,995 --> 01:30:05,959
Do you have time to stop and smell the roses?

1574
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:08,461
L've got no fucking sense of smell.

1575
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:09,959
All right, l'm done.

1576
01:30:10,171 --> 01:30:12,369
Come on, folks. do a little research.

1577
01:30:12,369 --> 01:30:14,369
That would've been nice information.

1578
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:18,577
L'm sorry, l must be tired from the show or something.

1579
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:21,476
-lt's okay. -yeah, dewey, it's okay.

1580
01:30:21,682 --> 01:30:24,480
No, it's not okay. l should be able to do this.

1581
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:26,516
We're in no rush.

1582
01:30:27,155 --> 01:30:29,248
Should we get an american lndian woman?

1583
01:30:29,457 --> 01:30:31,457
No, that won't help. l mean

1584
01:30:31,457 --> 01:30:33,257
It should already be pretty exciting.

1585
01:30:33,461 --> 01:30:35,520
There's three of you.

1586
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:46,667
-dewey. -nate?

1587
01:30:46,874 --> 01:30:50,332
You were supposed to be double great. what the fuck is this bullshit?

1588
01:30:50,545 --> 01:30:52,638
-l know. -all l'm asking...

1589
01:30:52,847 --> 01:30:54,712
...is that you write one masterpiece...

1590
01:30:54,916 --> 01:30:57,441
...that is the culmination of your entire life.

1591
01:30:57,652 --> 01:30:58,641
How hard is that?

1592
01:30:59,086 --> 01:31:02,453
L'm empty, nate. what do l do?

1593
01:31:02,657 --> 01:31:06,000
Dewey, who's the one person in your life 

1594
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,390
Who's made you feel like shit?

1595
01:31:07,595 --> 01:31:09,961
-pa. -you need to talk to him, dewey.

1596
01:31:10,832 --> 01:31:13,198
-l don't know. -you need to hug him.

1597
01:31:13,868 --> 01:31:17,736
L have been putting this off my entire life...

1598
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:20,600
...but l think you might be right.

1599
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:25,411
The wrong kid died

1600
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:29,215
Hello, pa.

1601
01:31:33,221 --> 01:31:34,552
What do you want?

1602
01:31:34,755 --> 01:31:37,189
L feel like there's some things l need to say to you.

1603
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:39,858
Well, go on. talk.

1604
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:42,720
L've realized that...

1605
01:31:43,231 --> 01:31:45,224
...l never really said l was sorry 

1606
01:31:45,231 --> 01:31:47,224
For what happened with nate.

1607
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:51,070
Pa, l've spent my entire life...

1608
01:31:51,272 --> 01:31:54,605
...trying to find love with wives...

1609
01:31:54,809 --> 01:31:56,640
...and hotel clerks...

1610
01:31:56,844 --> 01:31:58,903
...and tollbooth attendants...

1611
01:31:59,113 --> 01:32:02,241
...and giraffes and monkeys and trampolines...

1612
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:05,510
...and men who dress like women and men who look like you.

1613
01:32:06,587 --> 01:32:11,251
And l realized the only person l've ever really wanted to love me...

1614
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:14,394
...was you, pa.

1615
01:32:16,998 --> 01:32:18,898
Dewey, l don't know what to say.

1616
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:21,728
You don't have to say anything, pa.

1617
01:32:21,936 --> 01:32:25,394
L just wanted to come here and tell you that l loved you...

1618
01:32:26,073 --> 01:32:27,370
...and l always have.

1619
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:35,244
L appreciate you finding the courage to say that, dewey.

1620
01:32:36,150 --> 01:32:38,618
But there's only one way to settle this.

1621
01:32:40,955 --> 01:32:42,616
-machetes. -what?

1622
01:32:42,823 --> 01:32:45,553
The right kid is gonna die tonight.

1623
01:32:48,963 --> 01:32:50,863
You've been practicing!

1624
01:33:06,948 --> 01:33:08,347
No, pa. no!

1625
01:33:08,549 --> 01:33:11,450
L been waiting for this for a long time!

1626
01:33:11,652 --> 01:33:13,313
You have?

1627
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:21,059
Oh, no.

1628
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:23,492
Oh, my goodness!

1629
01:33:23,698 --> 01:33:25,325
L halved myself.

1630
01:33:25,533 --> 01:33:28,024
Pa! no, pa!

1631
01:33:28,235 --> 01:33:32,763
Dewey, l guess l never realized until this moment...

1632
01:33:32,974 --> 01:33:38,276
...just how easy it is to accidentally cut someone in half.

1633
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:39,468
Lt is, right?

1634
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:41,944
L'm sorry for blaming you, dewey.

1635
01:33:42,149 --> 01:33:45,209
Of course you didn't mean to cut nate in half.

1636
01:33:45,419 --> 01:33:47,546
Lt's all so obvious now.

1637
01:33:47,755 --> 01:33:48,949
Pa.

1638
01:33:49,156 --> 01:33:51,681
L should've been a better father to you, dewey.

1639
01:33:51,892 --> 01:33:55,487
L wish l spent more time playing catch with you...

1640
01:33:55,696 --> 01:33:57,888
...and less time training my body and mind 

1641
01:33:57,888 --> 01:34:00,429
To kill you in a machete fight.

1642
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:03,900
You be a better father than l was, dewey.

1643
01:34:04,105 --> 01:34:05,367
L'll try, pa.

1644
01:34:05,573 --> 01:34:07,200
Lt shouldn't be that hard.

1645
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:08,602
Ln case l don't make it--

1646
01:34:08,809 --> 01:34:12,301
Pa! you're gonna make it! lt's the 1 9 70s!

1647
01:34:12,513 --> 01:34:16,108
They got all kinds of new procedures that can attach tops to bottoms now!

1648
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:18,547
Hang in there! you're gonna be fine!

1649
01:34:18,753 --> 01:34:22,450
L reckon you're probably right. now, go call the doctor...

1650
01:34:22,657 --> 01:34:25,285
-...and bring me some ice, a lot of ice. -some ice.

1651
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:27,780
And a tourniquet. don't forget a tourniquet.

1652
01:34:27,795 --> 01:34:30,600
-all right, ice and a tourniquet? -lce and a tourniquet.

1653
01:34:30,665 --> 01:34:33,065
-and a tourniquet. -don't forget that tourniquet.

1654
01:34:33,267 --> 01:34:36,566
And you know those three words you always wanted to hear, dewey?

1655
01:34:36,771 --> 01:34:38,204
Well, here they are.

1656
01:34:38,506 --> 01:34:39,973
L love....

1657
01:34:43,044 --> 01:34:44,102
You love what?

1658
01:34:44,478 --> 01:34:46,537
Pa, you love what?

1659
01:34:46,881 --> 01:34:48,974
What was the third word?

1660
01:34:49,183 --> 01:34:50,616
Come on, one more word!

1661
01:34:50,818 --> 01:34:52,979
No!

1662
01:34:55,089 --> 01:34:58,217
L want all you fucking parasites out of my house...

1663
01:34:58,426 --> 01:34:59,757
...right now!

1664
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:02,690
L said, everybody out!

1665
01:35:03,264 --> 01:35:06,097
Well, look at you, you arrogant cocksucker.

1666
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:09,235
-how dare you. -what happened to you, dewey?

1667
01:35:09,437 --> 01:35:11,032
L don't know what's happened to me

1668
01:35:11,032 --> 01:35:13,032
But l know what happened to you.

1669
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:15,003
Patrick duffy took a beating.

1670
01:35:17,344 --> 01:35:19,904
Stop it, dewey, you son of a bitch.

1671
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:25,885
Stop it! patrick duffy was only saying what we were all feeling.

1672
01:35:26,087 --> 01:35:29,147
You get the hell away from me, cheryl cox-tiegs!

1673
01:35:32,993 --> 01:35:35,860
If you tear that sink off the wall, l'm leaving you.

1674
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:37,257
-oh, yeah? -yeah.

1675
01:35:40,334 --> 01:35:42,768
I'm leaving you, dewey cox.

1676
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:44,704
No!

1677
01:36:32,253 --> 01:36:33,481
Dad?

1678
01:36:36,457 --> 01:36:38,948
Yes, what is it, son?

1679
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:41,958
I was just wondering if you wanna have a catch.

1680
01:36:44,064 --> 01:36:45,224
A catch?

1681
01:36:47,401 --> 01:36:49,096
Son...

1682
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:54,006
...there is nothing in this world l want more...

1683
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:56,904
...than to have a catch with you.

1684
01:36:58,245 --> 01:37:02,648
Son, forgive me, this is going to sound strange...

1685
01:37:03,684 --> 01:37:05,618
...but what is your name again?

1686
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:08,948
I'm dewey junior, but my friends call me ''dewdrop.''

1687
01:37:15,095 --> 01:37:18,587
It's nice to formally meet you, dewdrop.

1688
01:37:18,866 --> 01:37:21,391
So this is catch.

1689
01:37:22,102 --> 01:37:25,230
This is what l been missing out on all them years on the road, huh?

1690
01:37:26,073 --> 01:37:29,839
I like it, it's wonderful. you throw it to me, l throw it back to you.

1691
01:37:30,044 --> 01:37:33,309
It's so simple, and yet so powerful.

1692
01:37:34,448 --> 01:37:36,507
Boy, you're really terrible at this game.

1693
01:37:36,717 --> 01:37:39,345
Well, l mean, you never really played with me before.

1694
01:37:39,553 --> 01:37:42,954
How am l supposed to learn? a boy needs a dad.

1695
01:37:43,457 --> 01:37:45,220
Yes, he does.

1696
01:37:45,993 --> 01:37:49,622
Well, l reckon we got some lost time to make up, you and me.

1697
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:52,594
And all your brothers and sisters. how many of you are there?

1698
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:56,930
Twenty-two brothers and sisters. and also 1 4 half-brothers and half-sisters.

1699
01:37:57,137 --> 01:37:59,002
Holy shit.

1700
01:37:59,573 --> 01:38:00,767
This may take a while.

1701
01:38:03,978 --> 01:38:05,673
That's real good.

1702
01:38:08,549 --> 01:38:10,039
So beautiful.

1703
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:17,582
Are you sure you're one of mine?

1704
01:38:42,216 --> 01:38:44,116
Go ahead and taste some dirt.

1705
01:38:44,318 --> 01:38:45,910
That's good dirt. that's good dirt.

1706
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:49,055
On the surface, macbeth is about revenge.

1707
01:38:49,256 --> 01:38:50,416
But what is the subtext?

1708
01:38:50,624 --> 01:38:53,752
A power struggle for the scottish royal family, that's what it is.

1709
01:38:53,961 --> 01:38:55,826
I just gave you it. 

1710
01:39:02,169 --> 01:39:03,602
Yeah.

1711
01:39:17,017 --> 01:39:18,006
Hello, dewey.

1712
01:39:19,086 --> 01:39:20,610
Darlene.

1713
01:39:20,821 --> 01:39:22,383
It's dewina's birthday. 

1714
01:39:22,383 --> 01:39:25,383
l brought her a present. lt's a bracelet.

1715
01:39:26,627 --> 01:39:28,060
How's glen campbell?

1716
01:39:28,262 --> 01:39:29,991
He and l split up a long time ago.

1717
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:31,924
Really?

1718
01:39:32,299 --> 01:39:34,199
It's just me these days.

1719
01:39:34,401 --> 01:39:35,766
At age 50.

1720
01:39:36,670 --> 01:39:39,662
Would you care to take a walk with me, darlene madison?

1721
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:44,555
I haven't been playing much music last few years.

1722
01:39:45,079 --> 01:39:47,079
I realize now I wasn't much of a father 

1723
01:39:47,079 --> 01:39:49,448
When l was out on the road.

1724
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:51,876
Now this is what makes me happy.

1725
01:39:52,086 --> 01:39:55,886
Not the music, not getting high...

1726
01:39:56,090 --> 01:39:57,921
...just my family.

1727
01:39:58,125 --> 01:39:59,558
That's all I care about.

1728
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,456
And that family is missing one piece, darlene.

1729
01:40:03,364 --> 01:40:06,424
My god, you're as beautiful as the day l met you.

1730
01:40:11,839 --> 01:40:14,501
You don't want this dirty old cox.

1731
01:40:14,708 --> 01:40:16,471
Oh, I want it more than ever.

1732
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:22,080
Did you wash your hair today?

1733
01:40:22,282 --> 01:40:24,978
I sure did. how could you tell?

1734
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:27,551
It smells terrific.

1735
01:40:35,763 --> 01:40:36,923
I smelt it.

1736
01:40:37,664 --> 01:40:39,131
You mean...?

1737
01:40:40,467 --> 01:40:42,264
I smelt it!

1738
01:40:43,570 --> 01:40:45,094
I can smell again!

1739
01:40:47,775 --> 01:40:49,208
I smelt it!

1740
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:51,810
-I smell you. -smell it.

1741
01:40:52,279 --> 01:40:54,042
Oh, you've been driving me wild.

1742
01:40:54,815 --> 01:40:57,113
I smelt it! I smelt it!

1743
01:40:57,317 --> 01:40:59,217
I smelt it, god!

1744
01:40:59,420 --> 01:41:01,854
It's a miracle!

1745
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:04,100
I smell you, flowers.

1746
01:41:04,124 --> 01:41:05,888
I smell you, twig.

1747
01:41:07,628 --> 01:41:09,555
I smell horseshit!

1748
01:41:12,666 --> 01:41:14,566
It's horrible!

1749
01:41:14,768 --> 01:41:17,202
-but l can smell it! -smell that shit, baby!

1750
01:41:17,404 --> 01:41:19,099
I smelt it.

1751
01:41:24,978 --> 01:41:27,105
Anyway, that's when l learned...

1752
01:41:27,314 --> 01:41:31,011
...that quaaludes and water-skiing do not mix.

1753
01:41:31,218 --> 01:41:32,685
Now, you remember that.

1754
01:41:32,886 --> 01:41:35,286
How come you did all of that stuff, grandpa?

1755
01:41:35,489 --> 01:41:40,586
Well, dewey rahim, I'll tell you. I was young and stupid then.

1756
01:41:40,794 --> 01:41:42,955
I didn't understand a lot of things.

1757
01:41:43,163 --> 01:41:46,326
Think it had to do with how l was reared as a boy.

1758
01:41:46,767 --> 01:41:49,327
But, you know, l got no complaints.

1759
01:41:49,536 --> 01:41:51,697
It's been a beautiful ride.

1760
01:41:52,206 --> 01:41:53,434
A beautiful ride?

1761
01:41:56,643 --> 01:41:59,111
A beautiful ride.

1762
01:42:00,147 --> 01:42:04,049
Dewey, sweetheart, there's someone here to see you.

1763
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:08,153
Mr. cox.

1764
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:11,617
I'm sorry, have we met?

1765
01:42:12,059 --> 01:42:15,256
You worked with my father, kvetch l'chaim.

1766
01:42:15,462 --> 01:42:16,827
You're mr. l'chaim's boy?

1767
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:19,498
Dreidel l'chaim, that's me.

1768
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:22,134
Well, it's nice to see you again, dreidel l'chaim.

1769
01:42:22,336 --> 01:42:23,564
The pleasure's all mine.

1770
01:42:23,770 --> 01:42:27,706
Listen, mr. cox, there's something l want to show you.

1771
01:42:27,908 --> 01:42:30,001
I never rock a fella but I rock a cinderella

1772
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:33,008
While she's sittin' in between a nigga's legs like a cello

1773
01:42:33,213 --> 01:42:34,942
Must be those pair of double-ds

1774
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:37,515
That got a nigga sittin' rock-hard in his jeans

1775
01:42:38,452 --> 01:42:40,545
Time to play make your mouth into a hole, yo

1776
01:42:40,754 --> 01:42:41,914
Tell me how I feel when I'm rockin' your boat

1777
01:42:42,122 --> 01:42:44,249
-i wanna make you fuckin' -hard

1778
01:42:46,326 --> 01:42:48,260
I'm so wet, I gotta make you

1779
01:42:48,462 --> 01:42:52,159
Hard

1780
01:42:54,568 --> 01:42:57,264
Mr. l'chaim, how could you allow them to do such a thing...

1781
01:42:57,471 --> 01:42:58,870
...with my husband's music?

1782
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:00,869
Through the roof, we're selling.

1783
01:43:01,074 --> 01:43:03,702
Lil' nutzzak. that's the rapper. sweet kid.

1784
01:43:03,911 --> 01:43:07,312
Anyway, he's introduced a whole new generation...

1785
01:43:07,514 --> 01:43:09,482
...to the magic of dewey cox.

1786
01:43:09,683 --> 01:43:10,888
You could even play together. 

1787
01:43:10,888 --> 01:43:13,175
Cox and lil' nutzzak. what a package.

1788
01:43:14,488 --> 01:43:16,115
Anyway, as if that was not enough...

1789
01:43:16,323 --> 01:43:19,053
...they're giving dewey the lifetime achievement award next month.

1790
01:43:21,662 --> 01:43:23,892
The lifetime achievement award?

1791
01:43:24,097 --> 01:43:26,793
Baby, that's wonderful.

1792
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,527
You go on tv, they give you the award.

1793
01:43:28,527 --> 01:43:30,527
You play a song, it's a magical thing.

1794
01:43:30,904 --> 01:43:32,997
I can't go on tv and play.

1795
01:43:33,207 --> 01:43:34,572
-what? why not? -why, grandpa?

1796
01:43:34,775 --> 01:43:39,405
Hell, I'm 7 1 years old. I don't even know if l can rock no more.

1797
01:43:39,613 --> 01:43:41,410
Of course you can rock, sweetheart.

1798
01:43:41,615 --> 01:43:43,640
Of course you can rock, sweetheart.

1799
01:43:43,850 --> 01:43:45,909
Well, l don't know that l can rock.

1800
01:43:47,354 --> 01:43:48,844
And besides that...

1801
01:43:51,558 --> 01:43:53,719
...l gave that life up for a reason.

1802
01:43:55,329 --> 01:43:57,763
I'm afraid of the temptations, darlene.

1803
01:43:57,965 --> 01:43:59,196
You can do it, dewey. 

1804
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,196
l know you can.

1805
01:44:01,969 --> 01:44:04,233
Just go out there and sing your song.

1806
01:44:07,741 --> 01:44:09,902
I'm gonna need my band.

1807
01:44:20,787 --> 01:44:22,482
My hip.

1808
01:44:38,605 --> 01:44:40,163
Ladies and gentlemen...

1809
01:44:40,374 --> 01:44:44,674
...please welcome jewel, lyle lovett and jackson browne.

1810
01:44:44,878 --> 01:44:46,436
Walk hard

1811
01:44:47,981 --> 01:44:49,676
Hard

1812
01:44:50,217 --> 01:44:52,048
Down life's

1813
01:44:52,486 --> 01:44:54,579
-rocky road -rocky road

1814
01:44:55,322 --> 01:44:56,619
Walk bold

1815
01:44:58,325 --> 01:45:00,190
Hard

1816
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:02,587
That's my creed

1817
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:05,460
-my code -my code

1818
01:45:05,732 --> 01:45:09,463
I been scorned and slandered and ridiculed too

1819
01:45:10,437 --> 01:45:14,339
Had to struggle every day my whole life through

1820
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:18,910
Seen my share of the worst this world can give

1821
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:24,849
But I still got a dream and a burnin' rage to live

1822
01:45:27,621 --> 01:45:28,610
Hello.

1823
01:45:28,822 --> 01:45:31,154
Oh, he is so cute.

1824
01:45:31,358 --> 01:45:33,519
What are you doing later, dewey?

1825
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:39,258
L am returning to the hotel with my family.

1826
01:45:39,633 --> 01:45:41,567
Good night to you.

1827
01:45:43,704 --> 01:45:45,501
He fucked my grandma.

1828
01:45:45,706 --> 01:45:47,230
That's awesome.

1829
01:45:47,441 --> 01:45:48,465
Ghostface killah.

1830
01:45:49,042 --> 01:45:51,442
Walking hard I'm a real hard walker

1831
01:45:51,645 --> 01:45:54,170
Fast on the trigger and a smooth talker

1832
01:45:54,381 --> 01:45:58,715
My guns pop out like a jack-in-the-box I'll cut you in half like dewey cox

1833
01:45:58,919 --> 01:46:00,216
-walk hard -my skin stays scarred

1834
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:01,910
You can ask god

1835
01:46:02,122 --> 01:46:04,147
Lots of ladies unsnapped they bras

1836
01:46:04,358 --> 01:46:06,826
Ask lyle lovett I had sex on mars

1837
01:46:07,027 --> 01:46:09,427
That's how we do it when we walk hard

1838
01:46:09,629 --> 01:46:12,120
-walk hard -how do I walk? hard as a stone

1839
01:46:12,332 --> 01:46:14,562
How do I walk? hard like a bone

1840
01:46:14,768 --> 01:46:17,134
-walk hard -how do I walk? like a jackhammer tool

1841
01:46:17,337 --> 01:46:19,771
How do I walk? harder than jewel

1842
01:46:19,973 --> 01:46:24,740
Tell me how we walk hard, hard, hard, hard

1843
01:46:24,945 --> 01:46:27,004
Oh, no. you're adorable.

1844
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:30,115
Sam. what are y'all doing in here?

1845
01:46:30,317 --> 01:46:33,582
Dewey, get out of here. you don't want no part of this shit.

1846
01:46:34,054 --> 01:46:35,043
What is it?

1847
01:46:35,255 --> 01:46:37,655
Lt's a medication for erectile dysfunction.

1848
01:46:37,858 --> 01:46:39,348
Lt gives you a boner.

1849
01:46:39,559 --> 01:46:41,789
Not to be used if you have a heart condition.

1850
01:46:41,995 --> 01:46:45,522
Lf boners last for more than four hours, call more ladies.

1851
01:46:46,233 --> 01:46:48,258
Well, that does sound tempting.

1852
01:46:48,468 --> 01:46:50,268
But do you know what, sam? 

1853
01:46:50,268 --> 01:46:52,268
l really don't want no part of that shit.

1854
01:46:52,706 --> 01:46:55,300
Did you hear what l said? lt gives you a boner.

1855
01:46:55,509 --> 01:46:57,943
Hate to let you down, old friend...

1856
01:46:58,145 --> 01:47:00,670
...but l don't wanna succumb to the temptations.

1857
01:47:00,881 --> 01:47:03,179
-my girl -my girl

1858
01:47:03,383 --> 01:47:06,682
Talkin' 'bout my girl, yeah

1859
01:47:06,987 --> 01:47:08,249
My girl

1860
01:47:09,489 --> 01:47:10,717
The temptations!

1861
01:47:10,924 --> 01:47:14,018
When it's cold outside

1862
01:47:14,928 --> 01:47:17,260
I got the month of may

1863
01:47:27,441 --> 01:47:30,001
Do l still have what it takes?

1864
01:47:30,710 --> 01:47:33,577
Am l still the man l used to be?

1865
01:47:35,081 --> 01:47:37,709
And do l even want to be?

1866
01:47:38,051 --> 01:47:40,212
You're still dewey cox.

1867
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:43,583
And you're the only man who ever will be.

1868
01:47:44,191 --> 01:47:45,681
But is that enough?

1869
01:47:45,892 --> 01:47:47,359
Lt's more than enough.

1870
01:47:49,796 --> 01:47:50,456
Nate.

1871
01:47:50,796 --> 01:47:54,426
Have l fulfilled my promise to be double great for the both of us?

1872
01:47:54,634 --> 01:47:57,728
Are you kidding? you've made 44 gold records.

1873
01:47:58,138 --> 01:48:00,163
You've been addicted to, and then kicked...

1874
01:48:00,373 --> 01:48:02,068
...almost every drug known to man.

1875
01:48:02,275 --> 01:48:05,438
You slept with 41 1 women and three men.

1876
01:48:05,645 --> 01:48:08,580
Dewey, you have had an awesome life.

1877
01:48:08,949 --> 01:48:10,917
L have, haven't l?

1878
01:48:11,117 --> 01:48:12,880
You sure have.

1879
01:48:14,321 --> 01:48:17,848
-pa. -son, you learned the hard way.

1880
01:48:18,058 --> 01:48:20,891
You can't spend all your time thinking about dewey cox.

1881
01:48:21,094 --> 01:48:23,722
You gotta think about the world and your family.

1882
01:48:23,930 --> 01:48:26,194
But then, at the same time....

1883
01:48:26,399 --> 01:48:27,923
Are you my inner child?

1884
01:48:28,134 --> 01:48:31,103
-yeah, dewey, l'm you. -he's us.

1885
01:48:31,338 --> 01:48:34,739
You realized you gotta take care of dewey cox.

1886
01:48:34,941 --> 01:48:38,035
That's a little different than what l was saying.

1887
01:48:38,245 --> 01:48:39,473
You're all right.

1888
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:44,707
Pa, inner child, nate, my own reflection.

1889
01:48:45,318 --> 01:48:48,810
L've learned that l can't spend all my time thinking about dewey cox.

1890
01:48:49,022 --> 01:48:51,547
And l've also learned l need to love dewey cox.

1891
01:48:51,758 --> 01:48:54,318
L can't spend all my time thinking about other people.

1892
01:48:54,528 --> 01:48:56,223
L have to focus on myself.

1893
01:48:56,429 --> 01:49:01,264
But also not focus on myself and instead focus on other people.

1894
01:49:01,468 --> 01:49:03,095
Lt's all so clear now.

1895
01:49:03,837 --> 01:49:06,499
Lt's not about yourself and other people.

1896
01:49:06,706 --> 01:49:08,970
-mama. -lt's about the music.

1897
01:49:09,175 --> 01:49:12,440
-lt's about the music. -lt always has been.

1898
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:14,972
Lt always has been.

1899
01:49:15,181 --> 01:49:17,342
Lt always has been.

1900
01:49:17,951 --> 01:49:21,216
-who are you? -l'm your feminine side.

1901
01:49:21,421 --> 01:49:23,946
L've been waiting for you to get in touch with me.

1902
01:49:26,626 --> 01:49:28,423
We heard him sing about walking hard...

1903
01:49:28,628 --> 01:49:31,859
...and we learned a little something about how we wanted to walk.

1904
01:49:32,432 --> 01:49:35,868
What do we think about when we think about cox?

1905
01:49:36,069 --> 01:49:37,866
He's been called the drifter.

1906
01:49:38,071 --> 01:49:42,440
Also the shape shifter, the master chef, the chameleon.

1907
01:49:42,642 --> 01:49:45,008
The problem child. the hard one.

1908
01:49:45,211 --> 01:49:48,112
The white lndian. the giant midget.

1909
01:49:48,348 --> 01:49:51,613
Lf elvis and buddy holly are the cain and abel of rock 'n' roll...

1910
01:49:51,818 --> 01:49:53,979
...and bruce springsteen is zechariah...

1911
01:49:54,187 --> 01:49:55,984
...lggy pop is methuselah...

1912
01:49:56,189 --> 01:49:59,818
...and, of course, neil young is the wise prophet ezekiel...

1913
01:50:00,026 --> 01:50:02,790
...then what does that make dewey cox?

1914
01:50:02,996 --> 01:50:04,725
Well, l don't know what god....

1915
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:06,125
Mr. cox?

1916
01:50:06,933 --> 01:50:09,458
L don't wanna rush him, but he goes on in a minute.

1917
01:50:10,971 --> 01:50:15,738
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great honor to introduce...

1918
01:50:15,942 --> 01:50:19,207
...for the first time on-stage in 25 years...

1919
01:50:19,412 --> 01:50:22,472
...performing his final masterpiece...

1920
01:50:22,682 --> 01:50:25,207
...that will sum up his entire life...

1921
01:50:25,418 --> 01:50:26,976
Mr. cox?

1922
01:50:27,287 --> 01:50:28,845
...the one, the only...

1923
01:50:29,055 --> 01:50:30,613
L'm ready.

1924
01:50:30,824 --> 01:50:32,758
...mr. dewey cox.

1925
01:50:48,642 --> 01:50:50,633
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

1926
01:50:51,111 --> 01:50:52,942
You'll forgive me if l'm a bit rusty.

1927
01:50:53,146 --> 01:50:55,910
This is the first song l've written in a very long time.

1928
01:50:56,116 --> 01:50:57,174
L hope you enjoy it.

1929
01:50:59,319 --> 01:51:02,083
Now that I have lived

1930
01:51:02,722 --> 01:51:05,885
A lifetime's worth of days

1931
01:51:06,459 --> 01:51:08,950
Finally I see

1932
01:51:09,796 --> 01:51:13,527
The folly of my ways

1933
01:51:14,734 --> 01:51:17,396
So listen when I sing of

1934
01:51:17,771 --> 01:51:20,569
The temptations of this world

1935
01:51:21,307 --> 01:51:24,299
Fancy cars and needles

1936
01:51:26,079 --> 01:51:29,981
Whiskey, flesh and pearls

1937
01:51:30,350 --> 01:51:33,046
And then in the end

1938
01:51:33,586 --> 01:51:36,487
It's family and friends

1939
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:39,417
Loving yourself

1940
01:51:39,793 --> 01:51:42,318
But not only yourself

1941
01:51:42,696 --> 01:51:46,291
It's about the good walk and the hard walk

1942
01:51:46,499 --> 01:51:50,458
And the young girls you've made cry

1943
01:51:50,670 --> 01:51:55,232
It's about make a little music every day till you die

1944
01:51:56,009 --> 01:51:58,500
It's a beautiful ride

1945
01:51:58,712 --> 01:52:02,512
Beautiful ride

1946
01:52:02,716 --> 01:52:04,308
A beautiful ride

1947
01:52:04,517 --> 01:52:08,647
Beautiful ride

1948
01:52:10,690 --> 01:52:13,784
Beautiful

1949
01:52:13,993 --> 01:52:18,862
Beautiful ride

1950
01:52:19,632 --> 01:52:22,533
As I stand on the precipice of death

1951
01:52:22,936 --> 01:52:25,564
My perspective is enormous

1952
01:52:26,239 --> 01:52:28,799
Every leaf, every cloud

1953
01:52:29,209 --> 01:52:32,372
I see the hands which have formed us

1954
01:52:32,779 --> 01:52:35,043
And some days all you got

1955
01:52:35,782 --> 01:52:38,444
Is a nighttime graveyard walk

1956
01:52:38,852 --> 01:52:41,844
And you whistle some sweet melody

1957
01:52:42,055 --> 01:52:46,151
To the ghosts down at the dock

1958
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:49,094
Sing into your hand

1959
01:52:50,463 --> 01:52:52,988
Lead the marching band

1960
01:52:53,633 --> 01:52:58,127
Don't you let 'em fade your colors gray

1961
01:52:59,773 --> 01:53:02,401
Cause when all is said and done

1962
01:53:02,942 --> 01:53:05,467
When youth is spent and burned

1963
01:53:06,346 --> 01:53:09,076
You'll see that it's all about

1964
01:53:09,282 --> 01:53:10,408
Music

1965
01:53:10,817 --> 01:53:11,977
Flowers

1966
01:53:12,519 --> 01:53:13,508
Babies

1967
01:53:14,154 --> 01:53:15,781
Sharin' the good times

1968
01:53:15,989 --> 01:53:18,014
Travelin' not just for business

1969
01:53:18,224 --> 01:53:20,658
Accepting your mortality

1970
01:53:20,860 --> 01:53:26,093
This is finally what I've learned

1971
01:53:26,599 --> 01:53:29,500
And then in the end

1972
01:53:29,702 --> 01:53:32,637
It's family and friends

1973
01:53:33,406 --> 01:53:35,533
Loving yourself

1974
01:53:35,842 --> 01:53:38,675
But not only yourself

1975
01:53:39,245 --> 01:53:42,214
It's about the good walk and the hard walk

1976
01:53:42,582 --> 01:53:46,678
And the young girls you've made cry

1977
01:53:46,953 --> 01:53:52,357
It's about make a little music every day till you die

1978
01:53:52,559 --> 01:53:54,026
It's a beautiful ride

1979
01:53:54,227 --> 01:53:59,255
Beautiful ride

1980
01:54:00,466 --> 01:54:06,200
Beautiful ride

1981
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:09,673
Beautiful

1982
01:54:10,076 --> 01:54:13,102
Beautiful ride

1983
01:54:13,313 --> 01:54:17,909
Beautiful ride

1984
01:54:19,652 --> 01:54:24,954
Beautiful ride

1985
01:54:25,959 --> 01:54:28,723
Beautiful

1986
01:54:29,195 --> 01:54:36,294
Beautiful ride

1987
01:54:47,195 --> 01:54:51,294
Dewey died three minutes after this performance

1988
01:59:35,334 --> 01:59:36,824
Walk hard

1989
01:59:38,804 --> 01:59:40,294
Hard

1990
01:59:41,607 --> 01:59:43,131
Down life's

1991
01:59:44,310 --> 01:59:46,210
Rocky road

1992
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:49,404
Walk bold

1993
01:59:51,217 --> 01:59:52,206
Hard

1994
01:59:53,653 --> 01:59:55,382
That's my creed

1995
01:59:57,190 --> 01:59:59,988
My code

1996
02:00:00,193 --> 02:00:01,717
Walk hard

1997
02:00:03,329 --> 02:00:04,489
Walk hard

1998
02:00:06,532 --> 02:00:08,830
Walk hard

1999
02:00:10,036 --> 02:00:16,965
Walk hard
