1
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,380
Mr. Cox?

2
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,050
Mr. Cox?

3
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,250
Mr. Cox?

4
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,980
Guys, I need Cox.

5
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,220
He goes on in two minutes
and I can't find him.

6
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,090
Mr. Cox.

7
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,170
Mr. Cox?

8
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,370
You're gonna have to give him
a moment, son.

9
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,140
Dewey Cox needs to think about
his entire life before he plays.

10
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,640
Come on, Nate, let's go play.

11
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,070
I can't, Dewey. I gotta practice.

12
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,080
You can't practice all the time, Nate.
You're already perfect.

13
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,910
All right. Come on, Dewey,
let's go play!

14
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,490
- Today's gonna be the best day ever!
- Yeah!

15
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,420
Ain't nothing horrible
gonna happen today.

16
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,150
What do you wanna be
when you grow up, Dewey?

17
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,060
I don't know. Never really
thunk about it before.

18
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,930
When I grow up,
I'm gonna be a great composer.

19
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,070
And a professional baseball player.

20
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,100
Then I'm gonna be an astronaut,
and I'm gonna go to the moon.

21
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,170
There's nothing I won't do
with this long, long life of mine.

22
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,700
For sure.

23
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,640
That's what's great about being young.
So much time to do great things.

24
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,870
Let's go play!

25
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,890
My turn!

26
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,300
I got him! I got him!

27
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,560
Catch!

28
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,200
Chicken!

29
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,050
I challenge you to a duel, sir.

30
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,520
I don't know, Nate.

31
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,560
You know how mad Pa gets
when we play with his machetes.

32
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,860
Come on. There's nothing wrong
with a little machete-fighting.

33
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,360
Now, en garde!

34
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,070
- Do you yield, sir?
- Never!

35
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,540
Prepare to meet your maker.

36
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,580
- Dewey!
- Nate!

37
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,380
I'm halved!

38
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,250
Oh, we should've listened to Pa.

39
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,490
Dewey, I'm cut in half pretty bad.

40
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,360
In case I don't make it,
then you'll have to be double great...

41
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,060
...for the both of us.

42
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,460
Wow, that's a lot of pressure, Nate.

43
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,040
You can handle it, Dewey.
Now, run, get Pa!

44
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,910
Holy shit.

45
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:21,610
This was a particularly bad case
of somebody being cut in half.

46
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:27,130
I was not able to reattach
the top half of his body...

47
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,160
...to the bottom half of his body.

48
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,930
Speak English, doc!
We ain't scientists.

49
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,240
I'm sorry, folks. He's gone.

50
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,990
Oh, no!

51
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,570
Oh, my God.

52
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,040
Dear God. Oh, Dewey.

53
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,010
It's all your fault, Dewey Cox.

54
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,370
Oh, Pa, you don't mean that.
It's not his fault.

55
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,880
He cut him in half with a machete.

56
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,140
No.

57
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,150
You. You're not half the boy
that Nate was.

58
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,320
You're not even half the boy
that the top half of Nate was...

59
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,290
...after you cut him in half.

60
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,230
So you're saying I'm less than
a quarter of the boy Nate was?

61
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,920
The wrong kid died.

62
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,540
Ma, I can't smell anything.

63
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,640
You can't smell anything?

64
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,310
I think I lost my sense of smell.

65
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,840
You gone smell-blind, son.

66
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,640
It'll pass, Dewey.

67
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,320
Now, you run on down to the country
store and get us some butter.

68
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,080
And a candle.

69
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,660
We're gonna light us
a candle tonight.

70
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,400
I'm a gamblin' man

71
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,870
I gambled everywhere I go

72
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,240
Lord, I'm a gamblin' man

73
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,220
Gambled everywhere I go

74
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,930
I'm a gamblin' man

75
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,990
Lord, I gambled from door to door

76
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,060
I've never heard no music
like that before.

77
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,120
It's so sad.

78
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,350
That's why it's called the blues, boy.

79
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,130
I think I'd like to play me
some blues.

80
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,860
Ain't no 6-year-old boy understand
the true meaning of the blues.

81
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,130
I reckon I might.

82
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,010
You play the guitar?

83
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,300
Never have before.
But I'm a real fast learner.

84
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,100
Well, go ahead.

85
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,920
You put your finger right up there.
Place your hands here. That's it.

86
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,250
That's the G chord.

87
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,820
Now hit the strings
with your other hand.

88
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,400
- That's it.
- There you go.

89
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,170
That ain't bad.

90
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,970
I done a bad thing

91
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,170
Cut my brother in half

92
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:48,420
I done a bad, bad thing

93
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,530
Cut my brother in half

94
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,770
My mama's gonna cry

95
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,510
Somewhere the devil's havin' a laugh

96
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,680
It's not bad for your first time.

97
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,880
You can do it, Dewey.
You'll be double great.

98
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,080
For the both of us.

99
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,100
Dewey?

100
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,040
Dewey.

101
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,740
Dewey?

102
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,970
Mama, you made it!

103
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,680
There's my favorite 14-year-old son.

104
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,550
Oh, no. Come on, now.
Not in front of the fellas.

105
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,820
Howdy, boys.

106
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,760
Howdy, Mrs. Cox.

107
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,450
I just wanted to say break a leg.

108
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,030
I know you boys are gonna
play a real good song.

109
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,460
Oh, thanks, Ma.

110
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,070
I'm just so proud you learned to play
the guitar so good.

111
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,030
Without even having
a sense of smell.

112
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,140
It's all right now, Mama.
I learned how to play by ear.

113
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,440
You just go out there
and sing your heart out.

114
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,410
I will, Mama.

115
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,750
I don't know what we're doing here
at this high school talent show.

116
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,980
We're here to see our boy,
that's what we're doing here.

117
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,020
You all right, ma'am?

118
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,930
I'm fine.

119
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,670
Just my vertigo acting up again.

120
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,930
- What's vertigo?
- Just a little dizziness is all.

121
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,000
Ain't nothing terrible
ever came from no dizziness.

122
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,480
Testing, testing.

123
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,200
Crawdad, crawdad.

124
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,670
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to the annual talent show.

125
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:55,190
We're gonna get this going here with
the juggling talents of Johnny McGraw.

126
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,440
- How we gonna follow that?
- Delilah Montgomery.

127
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,020
- Delilah Montgomery.
- Very nice!

128
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,450
And now sophomore Dewey Cox
is gonna sing us a song.

129
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,450
So, ladies and germs...

130
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,220
I know, I know.

131
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,300
Please welcome Dewey Cox
and the Dewey Cox Four.

132
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,670
Hi. My name's Dewey Cox.

133
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,340
And this is a little song I wrote called
"Take My Hand."

134
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,910
I sure hope you like it.

135
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,320
The wrong kid died, goddamn it.

136
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,260
- Take
- Take, take

137
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,400
Take my hand

138
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,760
Take my hand

139
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,400
We're gonna walk through the park

140
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,970
I promise to have you
Home before dark

141
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,380
Home before dark

142
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,550
Oh, life would be so sweet

143
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:29,210
Walking with you down the street

144
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,220
This music is an outrage!

145
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,710
Come on and take my hand

146
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,650
Come on and take my hand

147
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,920
It's the devil's music!

148
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:42,580
It's all right if you're coy

149
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,670
After all I'm a boy

150
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,330
And you're a girl

151
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,730
But make no mistake

152
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,510
Yours is the hand
I want to take

153
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,300
So please

154
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,500
So please, please

155
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,610
Take my hand

156
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,010
You're going to hell!

157
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,680
Blasphemer!

158
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,590
That's it. I want you
out of this house, boy.

159
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,190
- Pa!
- You heard the preacher.

160
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,920
You think we don't know
what you're talking about...

161
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,560
...when you say "take my hand"?

162
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,360
What? It's about holding hands.

163
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,560
You watch your mouth.

164
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,830
You know who's got hands?
The devil.

165
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,060
And he uses them for holding.

166
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,480
I ain't got no room in my house
for no devil's spawn.

167
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,980
Be careful. Before you say something
you regret for the rest of your days.

168
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,740
Like what?
Like "the wrong kid died"?

169
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,050
Oh, no! No!

170
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,120
It's okay.
It's okay, Mama, settle down.

171
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,120
Pa's right.

172
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,120
Springberry ain't big enough
for me no more.

173
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,120
I reckon it's time for Dewey Cox
to move on.

174
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,090
But you're only 14.

175
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,740
Mama, I love you.

176
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,930
But I don't need nobody.

177
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,270
All I need is my music.

178
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,980
I seen my path today,
and I'm gonna take it.

179
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,640
And someday,
I'll make my masterpiece...

180
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,580
...and you'll all be proud of me.

181
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,480
Just like you were of Nate.

182
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,890
Can I come, Dewey?

183
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,750
Of course you can, Edith.
You're my girlfriend.

184
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,490
- I am?
- Yeah, silly.

185
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,930
I pointed at you in the audience.

186
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,690
Did you hear that?
I'm Dewey's 12-year-old girlfriend!

187
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,670
You're the most talented man
I've ever seen in my whole life.

188
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,600
And you will never get anything
but love and support from me...

189
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,680
...for you and your dreams
the rest of my life.

190
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,110
Well, then, go on.
Get out of this house.

191
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,690
Before I cut your dreams in half
like you cut mine in half.

192
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,790
Goodbye, Pa.

193
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,820
Just wait till you see
what happens now.

194
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,290
Here we go.

195
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,100
Ma and Pa leave home
All the kids get glad

196
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,130
You know our house's
Gonna jump like mad

197
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,430
We're gonna jump, li'l children, jump

198
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,630
We're gonna jump, li'l children, jump

199
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,840
We're gonna jump, li'l children
Mama and Papa's gone

200
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,080
Let's jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump

201
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,110
Jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump

202
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,980
We're gonna jump, li'l children
Mama and Papa's gone

203
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,750
Play it for me, daddy!

204
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,740
That's a sexy look right there.

205
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,460
Oh, I like it, I like it.

206
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,940
Let's jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump

207
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,540
Jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump

208
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,180
Jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump

209
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,280
Jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump

210
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,820
We're gonna jump, li'l children
Mama and Papa's gone

211
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,280
You know what I'm saying.

212
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:56,290
We're gonna jump, li'l children
Mama and Papa's gone

213
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,120
Let's take them home, fellas.

214
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,490
We're gonna jump, li'l children
Mama and Papa's gone

215
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,560
Yeah, baby. Wrap it up right there.

216
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,470
I'm gonna take one of them
home tonight.

217
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,140
My name is Bobby Shad
and these are the Bad Men.

218
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,500
We gonna take a break,
then we be right back...

219
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,300
...to rock till the morning light,
all right?

220
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,510
Mr. Shad! Mr. Shad!
Wow, that was really great.

221
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,840
Hey, I play a little guitar.
If you ever need...

222
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,320
- Dewey!
- Yes, sir?

223
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,420
I pay you to mop,
not bother the band.

224
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,580
My customers come to dance erotically,
and they need a clean floor to do it on!

225
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,790
Do your job or I'll find
somebody who will.

226
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,590
Yes, sir.

227
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,930
Lonesome blues

228
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,270
Dewey, will you cut out that racket?
I'm trying to feed your child!

229
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,210
How am I supposed to make it as
a famous musician if I don't practice?

230
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,750
Will you stop talking
about that music?

231
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,420
But it's my dream, baby.

232
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,920
I am tired of hearing about
your dreams, Dewey Cox.

233
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,250
You are a selfish dickhole.

234
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,890
Daddy said if we move home, he could
give you a job at the slaughterhouse.

235
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,620
You can make an honest living.

236
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:13,890
Wouldn't have to hang your head in
shame, walking around like a failure.

237
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,070
I think I'm doing okay for a 15-year-old
with a wife and a baby.

238
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,830
But, sweetheart...

239
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,910
...I thought you liked working
at the slaughterhouse for my daddy.

240
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,510
I did.

241
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,740
You got a real talent for this, boy.

242
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,750
Someday this is all gonna be yours.

243
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,280
It's just, as much as I loved it, Edith,
I want more than that.

244
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:43,020
Ain't no musician ever made
no money, Dewey.

245
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,960
What? Of course they do.
Plenty of them do.

246
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,430
Name one.

247
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,730
- Slim Whitman.
- Who the hell is Slim Whitman?

248
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,410
All right, Frank Sinatra.

249
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,000
Who the hell is Frank Sinatra?

250
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,970
Edith, I am starting to think...

251
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,980
...that maybe
you don't believe in me.

252
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,180
I do believe in you.

253
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,250
I just know you're gonna fail.

254
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,180
- What are you talking about, Edith?
- What about my dreams?

255
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,090
Edith, I told you,
I can't build you a candy house!

256
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,590
It will fall down! The sun will
melt the candy! It won't work!

257
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,200
It will if it never rains.

258
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,270
Dewey, you have got
to give up your dream.

259
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,600
Dreams don't come true.

260
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,040
I am gonna make
this dream come true.

261
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,510
Nobody ever said it's gonna be easy.

262
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,780
It's hard.

263
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,740
It ain't easy to walk
to the top of a mountain.

264
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,250
It's a long, hard walk.

265
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,430
It's a rocky road.

266
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,430
But I plan on walking.

267
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,160
Oh, I'm gonna walk.

268
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,660
Hard.

269
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,930
I will walk hard.

270
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,900
Walk hard.

271
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,750
I got a full house coming tonight.

272
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,510
If Bobby Shad can't play
I need to find someone who can.

273
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,950
I'm fine. I can play through the pain.

274
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,460
Should've thought before you punched
your landlord and got laryngitis.

275
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,290
I guess there's no music tonight.

276
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,800
Bullhickey! People come here
to dance erotically!

277
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,660
I ain't got no music,
I ain't got no nightclub.

278
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,840
Excuse me.

279
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,170
I play a little.

280
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,870
I don't know how
to tell you this, boy.

281
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,240
You're white.
This crowd will eat you alive.

282
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,010
I been watching Mr. Shad every night.
I know all the songs.

283
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,380
It'll be the same show.

284
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,890
It'll be just like Bobby Shad and the
Bad Men, only it'll be me tonight.

285
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,660
This is crazy.

286
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,690
But I ain't got no other choice.

287
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,490
I don't mean to put more
pressure on you, boy.

288
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,110
The suits from the record company
just got here.

289
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,240
Oh, okay.

290
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,110
Scared?

291
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,520
- A little.
- Well, you should be.

292
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,980
Those Jews control show business.

293
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,780
Just lay it down
exactly like Bobby does.

294
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:30,390
Good evening. We're Bobby Shad
and the Bad Men. I'm Dewey Cox.

295
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,230
Bobby Shad couldn't be here tonight
so I'm gonna do his show for you.

296
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,300
And I hope you enjoy it.

297
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,640
This first song
we're fitting to do is...

298
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,570
Well, it's about...

299
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,240
It's about when your woman
catches you.

300
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,350
You know, she catches you
running around town...

301
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,750
...getting into all kinds of strange.

302
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,420
This is racially insensitive.

303
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:59,720
And she says, "Son, get your lazy,
two-timing, Negro ass up out of here."

304
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,920
- And you say to her:
- What's he doing? You see that?

305
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,790
You got to love your Negro man

306
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,560
You got to love your Negro man

307
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,560
You got to love your Negro man

308
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,970
You got to love your Negro man

309
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,670
You got to love, love

310
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,370
- Is he playing "Negro Man"?
- He is playing "Negro Man."

311
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,070
He's playing "Negro Man."

312
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,840
From early in the morning
Till late at night

313
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,520
You know I love your apples
Let me take a bite

314
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,950
You got to love your Negro man

315
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,590
You got to love your Negro man

316
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,090
You got to love, love, love, love, love

317
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,020
Your Negro man

318
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,590
Yeah, come on, Dewey.

319
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,960
I know I treat you wrong
And that ain't right

320
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,660
Let me put it on you, mama
And you'll feel all right

321
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:44,270
You got to love your Negro man

322
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,960
You got to love your Negro man

323
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,570
You got to love, love, love, love, love

324
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,770
Your Negro man

325
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,280
Now, that's what I call
winning over an audience.

326
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,590
Go, Dewey, go.

327
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,690
I like what you did out there tonight.
Have you ever made a recording?

328
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,300
Oh, Mr. L'Chaim, Mr. Mazeltov,
that's been my dream.

329
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,270
He's not the one you want.
I'm the one you want.

330
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,210
- I think he's the one we want.
- He's got a nice thing.

331
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,980
He's not bad with the singing and the
playing and the shaking of the tochis.

332
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,190
I think you've got what it takes
to make it in the big time.

333
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,220
The big time?

334
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,090
When the moon hits your eye
Like a big pizza pie

335
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,890
That's amore

336
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,070
When the world seems to shine

337
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,290
What the hell is this?

338
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,200
Pizza pie. What's in a pizza pie?

339
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:56,000
Bells will ring
Ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling

340
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,010
And you'll sing "Vita bella"

341
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,410
Hearts will play
Tippy-tippy-tay

342
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,580
Please, I can't anymore.

343
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,780
That's what I was gonna say.

344
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:13,790
- That's amore
- Amore

345
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,700
That is amore

346
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,000
All right. Hold, please. Stop that.
Stop your singing!

347
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,260
Stop your singing this instant,
young man!

348
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,740
I will not have this in my studio!

349
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,310
That's just a terrible, terrible...

350
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,640
...terrible, terrible "That's Amore."

351
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,250
Maybe it was a wrong song choice?

352
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,580
If you just let me play one of my songs,
I think you'll like it a whole lot better.

353
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,320
You have failed conclusively.
It's over.

354
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,500
And there is nothing
that you can do...

355
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,430
...here in this room
that can turn that around.

356
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,400
Nothing you can do that can make up
for what you did to "That's Amore."

357
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,670
- Well, my mother liked it a whole lot.
- Your mother was wrong.

358
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,540
I was willing to open my mind...

359
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,640
...because these Jewish gentlemen
brought you in here.

360
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,640
They usually have good taste.

361
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,380
And now here you are in front of me
pretending you can sing.

362
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,710
And I have to say that today...

363
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,290
...your performance has shaken
my belief in the Jewish people.

364
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,690
Well, there's nothing
I would like more, sir...

365
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:23,590
...than to restore your faith in Judaism,
if you could just give me that shot.

366
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,920
But I'll tell you,
you have failed so far...

367
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,900
...and if somehow you are able
to sing a song now...

368
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,630
...bringing these boys together
you haven't even met...

369
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,400
...and make something
so personal, so new...

370
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,840
...that the whole world takes notice...

371
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,950
...and that your life
is never the same again...

372
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:45,610
But I'm telling you right now,
I don't think it's going to happen.

373
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,980
Wait, wait, wait. We're here already.
What could it possibly hurt?

374
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,480
L'Chaim, I'll do it for you.
But just one more song.

375
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,250
All right.

376
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,660
All right, son. I'm gonna
give you 15 more seconds.

377
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,700
Thank you, sir.
I hope you won't regret it.

378
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,170
Dewey, we don't know this song.

379
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,540
You just follow me.

380
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,840
I don't know.

381
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,760
Walk hard

382
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,560
Hard

383
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:36,960
Walk hard?

384
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:40,260
Down life's rocky road

385
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,000
Walk bold

386
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,680
Hard

387
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,920
That's my creed

388
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,640
My code

389
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:56,220
I been scorned and slandered
And ridiculed too

390
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:01,020
Had to struggle every day
My whole life through

391
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,600
Seen my share of the worst
That the world can give

392
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:11,260
But I still got a dream
And a burnin' rage to live

393
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,370
Walk hard

394
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,770
Hard

395
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,770
Here is America's new hit song
"Walk Hard"...

396
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,280
...recorded just 35 minutes ago
by Dewey Cox.

397
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,110
Hard

398
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,440
Though they say

399
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,390
You're not the one

400
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,920
Even if you've been told
Time and time again

401
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:39,490
That you're always gonna lose
And never gonna win

402
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,330
You gotta keep that vision
In your mind's eye

403
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:49,330
When you're standin' on top
Of a mountain high

404
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,710
He walks so hard.

405
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,350
How do I walk, boys?

406
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,860
Hard

407
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,990
When I meet my maker
On my dying day

408
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,100
I'm gonna look him in the eye
And by God, I'll say

409
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,000
I gave my word
And my word was good

410
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:23,210
I took it in the face
And I walked as hard as I could

411
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,350
Oh, hey, Shorty. Hello, my darling.

412
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,170
I sang a song at a circus
in New Jersey.

413
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,180
They said, "We'll give you 5 grand."

414
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,050
I said, "No, you won't.
You'll give me that giraffe."

415
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:37,980
- And they did. They gave it right to me.
- That is one beautiful giraffe.

416
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,180
Thank you.

417
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,620
It'll just be a few weeks, Edith.

418
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,920
Who's gonna help me
take care of the children?

419
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,620
Dewey, you have got to
give up this dream.

420
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,930
You're never gonna make it.
Give it up, Dewey.

421
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,100
What are you talking about?
I got a number one hit on the radio.

422
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,540
I'm playing my music
for people who wanna hear me.

423
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,540
It's everything we always wanted,
Edith.

424
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,980
I never get to see you anymore.
Your kids never get to see you.

425
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,370
I don't know how to tell you this.

426
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,110
I'm gonna miss some things, okay?

427
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,790
I'm gonna miss some birthdays
and some christenings.

428
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,680
I'm gonna miss some births, period.

429
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:14,020
Unrealistic to think I'm gonna be
here every time you have a baby.

430
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,660
But aren't you happy?
You have a beautiful new home.

431
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,590
All your fancy new clothes
and your monkey and your giraffe.

432
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,970
Look, what else you need?

433
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:26,970
How about I get you
a crow that could talk?

434
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,610
And I'll teach him phrases that I say.
"Good morning, honey."

435
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:34,510
- But it'll be a little crow talking.
- This ain't about no exotic pets!

436
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,770
It's about love,
you stupid piece of shit.

437
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,110
- Dewey.
- Edith!

438
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,790
Don't you go in the bathroom.

439
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,960
Edith, please.

440
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,320
Mama said there's a lot of evil
on the road.

441
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,360
Temptations.

442
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,090
They'll make a man do evil things.

443
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:58,460
Edith, that is ridiculous.
Is that what this is all about?

444
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,900
There ain't no evil out there.

445
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,740
Come on, now, cupcake,
open the door.

446
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,210
Edith.

447
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:15,220
My beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful angel.

448
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,280
You know how much I love you.

449
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,930
You and this fast-growing family
of ours...

450
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,100
...is the only thing
that matters to me.

451
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,820
You understand that?

452
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:32,840
Heck, life without you
would be like no life at all.

453
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,380
Like no life at all.

454
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,340
Where's a pencil? Where's a pencil?

455
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,420
Dewey!

456
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,110
Hello, baby!

457
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,450
Yeah, this is
the Big Bopper speaking.

458
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,290
Oh, you sweet thing.

459
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,090
Do I what?

460
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,450
Will I what?

461
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:03,300
Oh, baby, you know what I like.

462
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,170
Chantilly lace and a pretty face
And a ponytail

463
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,270
How are we supposed to follow that?

464
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,270
Don't worry, Dewey, you'll do great.

465
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,280
- Thanks, Buddy Holly.
- If you don't, I'll pick it back up.

466
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,640
- You got nothing to worry about.
- Oh, thank you.

467
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,050
I really like that "Walk Hard" song.

468
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,090
Oh, thanks.

469
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:25,490
I like that "Peggy Sue" song.
It's my favorite Buddy Holly song.

470
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:28,130
Thanks, Dewey.
I'm awful proud of that one.

471
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,350
Man, I'm awful nervous, Buddy Holly.

472
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,830
Dewey, you'll be fine,
or my name's not Buddy Holly.

473
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:37,330
Change of plans. Elvis wants
to get out of here early. He's hungry.

474
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,510
We'll change the order.
After the Big Bopper, it's Buddy Holly...

475
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,800
...then Elvis Presley,
and then you, Dewey Cox.

476
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:47,100
So it's the Big Bopper...

477
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,840
...and then Buddy Holly...

478
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:52,480
...and then Elvis Presley,
and then me?

479
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,020
Yeah. Just for tonight.

480
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,680
Well, I'm just happy to be here.

481
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,030
What am I doing?

482
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,430
I ain't good enough to follow Elvis.

483
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:09,100
What are you talking about, Dewey?

484
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,830
Nate. Nate, is that you?

485
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,980
You can do it, Dewey.
I know you can.

486
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,670
I know because I'm your brother,
and I believe in you.

487
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,180
But, hell, ain't nobody
can follow Elvis.

488
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,610
- Wait, did you say Elvis?
- Yeah.

489
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,620
Elvis Presley?
The King of Rock 'n' Roll?

490
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,190
Yeah, Elvis Presley.

491
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,420
He has nine number one hits.

492
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,030
Nate, I understand that.

493
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,060
He has 50 million fans.

494
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,700
I'm aware of that, Nate.
That's why I'm out here.

495
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,200
I'm having a crisis.

496
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,060
Holy shit.

497
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,770
Dewey! The big fella's on his
final encore. Are you ready?

498
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,580
Yeah. I'm ready.

499
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,660
Elvis!

500
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,680
Ladies.

501
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:09,760
Dang, Elvis Presley, you didn't
have to rile them up like that.

502
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,590
What, now?

503
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,660
- No, I'm...
- Excuse me, what?

504
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,990
I'm just saying,
we gotta follow that and...

505
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,000
Well, sometimes you have to go all out
when you're the King.

506
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,440
Because there's only one man
who's the King.

507
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,510
God picks him, hand-plucks him.

508
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:27,410
One night, God looked down at all the
millions and millions of people, man...

509
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:31,020
...and he decided which one
was the best, and it was me.

510
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,980
He plucked me from all those millions
and millions of people, man.

511
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,410
- Yeah.
- Listen to this, right now.

512
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,120
There's two things you need to know.
I'm the King. And number two is:

513
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,850
Look out, man! Look at that
coming at you. You see that?

514
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,620
It's called karate
and only two kinds of people know it.

515
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,960
The Chinese and the King.

516
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,600
And one of them is me.

517
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,830
You're the King.

518
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,670
On to Memphis, they want a nice little
honey and a little bit of June bug.

519
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,500
- Yeah?
- Yeah...

520
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,140
Come on, man...

521
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,640
Look out, man!

522
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,250
Well, thanks, Elvis.

523
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,560
Let's go. Come on, mama.

524
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,850
What the fuck was he talking about?

525
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,560
How y'all doing?
My name's Dewey Cox.

526
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:27,570
And, well, looks like I got some
proving myself to do.

527
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,170
Sam.

528
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,520
Walk hard

529
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,120
Hard

530
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,760
Down life's rocky road

531
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,870
Wow, great playing, boys.

532
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,600
The fillies love you, Dewey.

533
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:04,140
If I wasn't married with a good head on
my shoulders, I don't know what I'd do.

534
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,900
You gotta get back out there.
They are going crazy.

535
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,770
Let me splash some water
on my face.

536
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,570
Okay. Hurry up!

537
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:15,120
Golly, that rock 'n' roll.

538
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,820
- Get out of here, Dewey.
- What are y'all doing in here?

539
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:25,760
We're smoking reefer,
and you don't want no part of this shit.

540
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,330
You're smoking reefers?

541
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,300
Of course we are.
Can't you smell it?

542
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,460
No, Sam, I can't.

543
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,540
Come on, Dewey, join the party.

544
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,470
No, Dewey, you don't want this.
Get out of here!

545
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,340
I don't want no hangover.
I can't get no hangover.

546
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,640
It doesn't give you a hangover.

547
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:46,750
Will I get addicted to it
or something?

548
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,650
It's not habit-forming.

549
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,160
Oh, okay, well...

550
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,120
I don't know.
I don't wanna overdose on it.

551
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,520
You can't OD on it.

552
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,500
It's not gonna make me
wanna have sex, is it?

553
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,330
It makes sex even better.

554
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,570
Sounds kind of expensive.

555
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,830
It's the cheapest drug there is.

556
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,400
You don't want it.

557
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,870
I think I kind of want it.

558
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:15,140
Okay, but just this once.
Come on in.

559
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,810
- What do I do?
- Like this.

560
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,660
Oh, my.

561
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:43,040
Hey, listen, folks. I'd like to play
a song I wrote for a very special lady.

562
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,300
I'm talking about Mrs. Dewey Cox.

563
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,870
Oh, my darlin'

564
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,050
Oh, my darlin'

565
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah

566
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,420
I have a perfect life

567
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:04,790
You are the perfect wife

568
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,960
I don't know why

569
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:13,570
I sit and cry

570
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,670
And now I miss you so

571
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,080
Please don't let me go

572
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,910
I make mistakes and that is true

573
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,790
At least I learn each time I do

574
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:32,980
Here, have some of this.

575
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,520
Darling, you must believe

576
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:41,460
I could never leave you
If I tried

577
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,760
A life without you

578
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:53,710
Is no life at all

579
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,910
Oh, my darlin'

580
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,950
Oh, my darlin'

581
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah

582
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,620
Beth Anne.

583
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,290
Can I get that for you?

584
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,960
Thanks, Dewey.

585
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:12,760
Tears fall in vain

586
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:17,230
I'm standing in the rain

587
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,530
No matter how I feel

588
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:26,580
I never seem to know what's real

589
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:30,110
So sharpen up your knives

590
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,310
- Can I get that for you?
- Thanks, Dewey.

591
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,150
I'm a bad horse.

592
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,950
Phil, can I get that for you?

593
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,730
Thanks, Dewey.

594
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,960
Darling, you must believe

595
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,360
I could never leave you
If I tried

596
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:53,900
Phil? What happened?

597
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:58,070
A life without you

598
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:06,580
Is no life at all

599
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,730
Well, the tour's going
real great, baby.

600
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,990
Yeah, we're having a real nice time.

601
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,250
Yeah, the boys have been
playing great...

602
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,020
...and the audiences have been
just wonderful, so...

603
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,530
- When you coming home?
- Soon, baby, real soon.

604
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,970
We gotta hit the major markets in
the Northeast, Chicago, Detroit...

605
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:30,870
Dewey, could you shut up? I'm trying to
have sex with these women down here.

606
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,600
Who's that?

607
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,740
Oh, that's Sam.

608
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:39,150
- He's just looking for his drumsticks.
- Howdy.

609
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,940
Excuse me.

610
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:47,090
Anyway, you don't wanna hear about
this boring stuff. How was your day?

611
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,990
Oh, you know,
just taking care of the kids.

612
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,560
Went down to Wilson's Market
the other day to pick up some milk.

613
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,630
Completely out of milk.
I had to go down to Peach Street.

614
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,530
- I hate going down there.
- Oh, brother. Can you believe it?

615
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,760
- Yes, Bert?
- Hey, Dewey.

616
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,200
- You want a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.

617
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,740
Will you give me a minute?
I'm on the phone here.

618
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,870
- Who's that?
- That's Bert, my roadie.

619
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,170
Just wants to know if I want any coffee
or anything like that.

620
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,620
Dewey, there's a distance growing
between us, I feel, and I don't like it.

621
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,920
Oh, now, that is crazy talk, Edith.

622
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,650
You know
I'm just the same old Dewey.

623
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,590
- Hey, Dewey.
- Yes, Bert?

624
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,020
You seen my sandals?

625
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,900
I don't know.
I'm talking to my wife, Bert.

626
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,230
Baby, there's somebody at the door.
I gotta go.

627
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,060
Can I call when I get to New Jersey?

628
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,600
Okay. Bye, Dewey.

629
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,140
- I love you.
- All right.

630
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,540
- I love you.
- I love you.

631
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,140
- You're never gonna make it, okay?
- Okay, bye.

632
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,810
Bye.

633
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,110
- Pa.
- Dewey.

634
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,950
What are you doing here?

635
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,450
It's about your mama.

636
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,590
Ma? What about her? Is she okay?

637
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,960
We better step out into the hall.

638
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,200
- What happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.

639
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,310
We were readying for bed
when your song comes on the radio.

640
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,480
It's Dewey!

641
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,970
Your son is talented.
You should be proud.

642
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:23,220
Well, I must admit,
it is kind of catchy.

643
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,750
Dance with me, Pa.

644
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,820
It does make you kind of wanna move,
doesn't it?

645
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,390
It sure does.

646
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:36,330
Maybe I have been
kind of hard on little Dewey.

647
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,400
Maybe you have.

648
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,000
Be careful, Ma.

649
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:48,750
- You all right, Ma?
- I'm all right.

650
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,290
The vertigo, it won in the end.

651
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,720
She lost her balance...

652
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:02,290
...and fell out the window...

653
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,400
...and then the radio
crushed her head?

654
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,120
While she was dancing to your song.

655
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:11,130
I thought you should know
what your music does.

656
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,100
It kills people.

657
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:16,500
You made her happy
and it killed her.

658
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:20,870
If Nate was alive,
this never would have happened.

659
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,350
Wrong kid died.

660
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,250
Damn you, God!

661
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,260
How could you let my mama
fall out a window?

662
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:44,900
And then let a radio
hit her on the head?

663
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,740
- Get out of here, Dewey.
- What are y'all doing in here?

664
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:55,880
It's called cocaine,
and you don't want no part of this shit.

665
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,910
Cocaine?

666
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,890
What's it do?

667
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,750
It turns all your bad feelings
into good feelings.

668
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,150
It's a nightmare.

669
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,560
I'm thinking maybe I'd like to try me
some of that cocaine.

670
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,590
When I meet my maker
On my dying day

671
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,460
Look him in the eye
And by God I'll say

672
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,500
I gave my word
And my word was good

673
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:25,700
I took it in the face
And I walked as hard as I could

674
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:29,010
Walk hard
Walk hard, hard, hard

675
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,010
Walk hard, hard, hard
Walk...

676
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,150
All right, again. Faster.

677
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,990
This is crazy, Dewey. Ain't nobody
gonna wanna listen to music like this.

678
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,360
Standing there
playing as fast as you can...

679
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,190
...singing like some sort of punk.

680
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,640
Don't you dare try to stifle me.

681
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,270
Whose band is this anyway,
you cocksucker!

682
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,900
I'll punch you in the mouth!

683
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,910
Oh, God. I'm sorry, Dave.

684
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,670
No, I didn't mean that.

685
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:11,190
Just with my mama dying and all,
I'm just all twisted up inside.

686
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,620
Mr. Cox?

687
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:18,320
I heard you were looking for a new
backup singer. For your new duet.

688
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,060
You heard right.

689
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:26,530
I was wondering if you might like
to give me a try.

690
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,930
I reckon I might.

691
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,210
I've been singing in my church choir
since I was a girl.

692
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:36,870
I like the sound of that.

693
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,550
Darlene Madison.

694
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,380
Dewey Cox.

695
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,450
Hello, Darlene.

696
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,960
Hello, Mr. Cox.

697
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,090
You ready to sing one?

698
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,360
I'm always ready.

699
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,070
Well, all right.

700
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:04,080
In my dreams you're blowin' me

701
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,770
Some kisses

702
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:12,740
That's one of my favorite things
To do

703
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:17,390
You and I could go down

704
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:19,060
In history

705
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:26,290
That's what I'm prayin' to do with you

706
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:28,530
Let's duet

707
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,060
In ways that make us feel good

708
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,270
Let's duet

709
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,600
And make that sacred sound

710
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,480
Dewey Cox!
I am not that kind of woman.

711
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,850
- All right.
- Well...

712
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,720
...that doesn't mean
that we still can't be friends.

713
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,180
Okay.

714
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:57,920
Well, then, here's to us
being great friends.

715
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,560
I can't! We're friends!

716
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,030
I'm gonna beat off

717
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,100
All my demons

718
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:17,270
That's what lovin' Jesus' all about

719
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,510
Lookin' in your eyes I start believin'

720
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:30,760
Let's bring this whisper to a shout

721
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:32,990
Let's duet

722
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,500
In ways that make us feel good

723
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:41,170
Put two and two together

724
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:44,710
Perfect harmony we've found

725
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,940
We know it's only natural

726
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:50,670
Let's duet

727
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,450
I just wanna make out

728
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,350
What you're sayin'

729
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,150
Read my lips
It's what you're lookin' for

730
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:09,700
Here I am a-sneakin' up behind you

731
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:17,470
You can always come in
My back door

732
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,230
Let's duet

733
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:31,610
Darlene, these last three weeks
have been so...

734
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,050
...full and wonderful.

735
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,460
We've shared so many activities
together as good friends.

736
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:42,190
It's like you understand me
the way nobody else ever has.

737
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:44,330
I mean, if I...

738
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:54,650
- What is it, Dewey?
- I don't know.

739
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:56,780
It's nothing. I'm fine.

740
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,970
Nothing? You look like
you seen a ghost.

741
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:04,290
I got a lot of pain in me, Darlene.

742
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,420
You should know that.

743
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:08,950
Where does all that pain
come from, Dewey?

744
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:14,330
Did you ever have something
that you really loved...

745
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,200
...that you accidentally...

746
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,300
...killed, or hurt in some way,
with a machete?

747
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:25,640
- No.
- No, me neither.

748
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,280
- Wouldn't that be terrible?
- How would you live?

749
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,420
I know, right? Exactly.

750
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:34,050
Darling Darlene

751
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:38,790
Darling Darlene

752
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:42,090
I'm in love with you
I'm havin' fun with you

753
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:45,390
I'm in love with you
I'm on the run with you

754
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:50,730
I'm in love with you
And I'll be one with you one day

755
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:58,970
Thanks for letting me sleep
in your bunk, Dewey.

756
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,940
Gotta sleep somewhere, right?

757
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:06,450
- Dewey, I can't.
- I know. I know.

758
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:10,710
We both know that the sexual tension
between us is palpable.

759
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:14,530
Don't you know that I wrestle with
the same temptations you do?

760
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:17,160
I know I shouldn't be saying this
to you, Dewey...

761
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,160
...because we're not married
and we're just friends...

762
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:25,630
...but sometimes I lie awake at night
aching for a man's touch.

763
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:29,800
And by "a man's touch,"
I mean a penis in my vagina.

764
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,770
It's just so silly.

765
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,040
Oh, that's so silly.

766
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:38,220
- Well, we better get some sleep.
- Okay.

767
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,510
Take my hand, Dewey.

768
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:47,150
Let's promise to never, ever give in
to our lesser desires.

769
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,160
After all, we're not married.

770
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,560
I'm ready for sex.

771
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:11,850
I been waiting for this for so long.

772
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:13,240
Me too.

773
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:15,720
From the moment I laid eyes on you.

774
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,560
Oh, my.

775
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,360
Dewey, I'm nervous.

776
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:39,340
Don't worry, angel.
I'll show you the ways of love.

777
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,680
Whoops-a-daisy.

778
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,510
Oh, Dewey.

779
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,710
Surprise!

780
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,550
Edith!

781
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:56,580
- Who are you?
- I'm his wife, that's who I am.

782
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,030
No, you're not. I'm his...

783
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,200
- Good Lord, you're already married?
- I can explain.

784
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,460
Explain to her? You should explain
to me. I am the mother of your children.

785
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:09,770
- It's not what it looks like.
- Children?

786
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,410
It's not what it looks like.

787
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:14,140
Not what it looks like to me,
or not what it looks like to her?

788
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:17,110
It's gotta be the way it looks like
to at least one of us.

789
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,410
We're married.

790
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:21,580
I did the right thing.
It's not like we're not married.

791
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:23,980
If you're married,
you can't get married again.

792
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:27,420
I know, I know, and that was wrong,
but it's just...

793
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:30,060
We were such good friends.

794
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:33,250
You told me about that dream
where you were licking my balls...

795
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,200
...and that seemed like a signal,
and...

796
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:37,490
I forgot.

797
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:41,960
I'm leaving you, Dewey Cox,
and I will see you in court!

798
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:44,300
No, Edith! Don't go!

799
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:49,010
Oh, well. She's gone now.

800
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:54,250
I'm leaving too. You got the order
of things all backwards.

801
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,280
Darlene, don't go!

802
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:58,220
Edith, don't go either!

803
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:03,860
I made a mistake.
I made a terrible mistake.

804
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:07,890
Edith! Edith! Edith!

805
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,690
- Leave me alone, Dewey.
- I never meant no harm to you.

806
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,170
Edith. Cupcake.

807
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:17,270
Baby, you don't know what it's like out
there on the road. It's lonely out there.

808
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:19,330
Edith, I can't be alone.

809
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:22,980
Maybe you should've thought of that
before you got double married.

810
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:25,640
Is that what this is about?

811
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:29,480
Don't you stand there and judge me
like I'm some kind of criminal.

812
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:32,450
You are a criminal.
This is illegal, Dewey.

813
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,850
What do you mean?

814
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:37,590
It's illegal to be married to two people
at the same time, Dewey.

815
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,100
What about if you're famous?
Is that?

816
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:43,860
You never done nothing
you shouldn't have done?

817
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:45,300
What have I ever done?

818
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,230
You woke up in the middle
of the night and drank the milk.

819
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,700
I got up to have my cornflakes,
there's none left.

820
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:52,380
Dewey, you cheated on me!

821
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,210
So I'm a cheater,
but you can just drink up all the milk.

822
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:58,780
Okay. All right, that's fine, I get it.
You're innocent, and I'm guilty.

823
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,040
Guilty as charged.

824
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:03,680
Guilty as charged

825
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:06,190
Don't you dare write a song
right now, Dewey!

826
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,430
You know what? Go ahead.
Take the children. I don't care.

827
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,490
All I need is my music.

828
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:13,960
I don't need you.

829
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:15,860
And I don't need you.

830
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:17,230
And I don't need you.

831
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,760
And I don't need you.

832
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:22,940
You're just sitting there
all high and mighty in your diaper.

833
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:26,670
If anything, you need me.
You're a baby.

834
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:27,900
Come on, Miles.

835
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:31,170
Don't you dare take Miles.

836
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:35,410
You can take the children,
but you leave me my monkey.

837
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:37,420
Fine.

838
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:40,220
Goodbye, Dewey Cox.

839
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,420
No! No, come back.

840
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:44,590
Don't leave me, Edith.

841
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,700
"Don't leave me, Edith."
There's a title for a song.

842
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:56,600
That's not a bad title,
but please don't leave me.

843
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:58,400
What have you done?

844
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,820
I'm telling you, I've had it.
I've had it with all this crap.

845
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,320
You took her side every time.

846
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,960
All you care about is fruit
and touching yourself. Well, fuck you.

847
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,720
Get out of here.
You don't want no part of this.

848
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:21,420
- What y'all doing in here?
- We doing pills, uppers and downers.

849
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:23,400
They're the logical next step for you.

850
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,260
I want some of that shit.

851
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:31,140
Good morning, Your Honor.
May I approach the bench?

852
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,610
I don't give a damn
What anyone thinks

853
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:45,580
I stay up all night
And I smoke and I drink

854
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:50,760
I'm a wanted man
And I'm blowin' town

855
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,830
Don't waste your time
Tryin' to hunt me down

856
00:52:55,930 --> 00:53:00,560
The cops are sayin'
I belong behind bars

857
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,670
And I'm guilty

858
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:04,870
Guilty

859
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:07,140
I'm guilty as charged

860
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,110
Does Dewey seem unhappy to you?

861
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:15,250
He's changed, I tell you,
he's changed.

862
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:18,050
That was early Dewey,
this is middle Dewey.

863
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,520
Dewey, are you enjoying yourself?

864
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:25,530
What? Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot you were here.

865
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:28,030
Hey, Dave. I like your girl better,
let's switch.

866
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,030
- Well, Dewey, this is my wife.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

867
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,330
Well, this is Kathy.
Kathy, this is Dave.

868
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:37,200
Come on, darling.
So where you from?

869
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,000
Hi there.

870
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:43,040
Guilty

871
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:45,910
I'm guilty as charged

872
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:50,150
I ain't askin' God to forgive my sins

873
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,020
Take a good look
And you'll know where I've been

874
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,890
I'm dancin' with the devil
Every night and every day

875
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:59,320
People pay attention to the things
That I say

876
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:00,520
Say

877
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:04,130
Hey, Jerry, I'm a long-time listener
and a first-time caller.

878
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,830
Yeah, I just wanted to say
I love the show, keep it up.

879
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,800
Am I on the radio right now?

880
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:12,970
I'm guilty as charged

881
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:18,840
If you're sayin' my love is too large

882
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:20,110
Then I'm guilty

883
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:25,380
Goddamn it,
this is a dark fucking period!

884
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,690
Oh, I'm guilty

885
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,950
- Freeze! Hands above your head.
- It's not what it looks like.

886
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,290
I'm guilty as charged

887
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,490
Stop!

888
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:36,730
You got me.

889
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,770
Come on, Mr. Cox. How about it?
Look here.

890
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:47,610
I'm guilty as charged

891
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:59,190
Cox, you got a visitor.

892
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:03,950
Prison has changed me.

893
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:07,490
I understand the common man
in a way I never did before.

894
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:13,360
I gotta get out of here, so I can
bring joy to the men back in here.

895
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:15,870
But I don't wanna live with them.

896
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:17,800
Lean closer.

897
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:22,140
I'm going to speak to you
in my language...

898
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:26,010
...so that the guards can't understand
what I'm saying.

899
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:29,080
There must be something you can do.

900
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:31,590
I'm 21 years old.

901
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:34,520
I got my whole life ahead of me...

902
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:38,360
We think we can get you off.

903
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:39,890
What do I have to do?

904
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:42,930
You gotta go to rehab.

905
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,360
- "Rehab"?
- Rehab.

906
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,570
- Rehab?
- Oh, rehab. Okay, okay, I gotcha.

907
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,910
Doctor! Doctor!

908
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,380
- I'm so cold.
- We need more blankets.

909
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,140
We need more blankets.

910
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:03,510
Doctor!

911
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,590
- I'm so hot!
- I think he has too many blankets.

912
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:07,820
Fewer blankets!

913
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:10,790
I'm hot and cold at the same time!

914
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,860
He needs more blankets
and he needs less blankets.

915
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,790
I'm afraid you're right.

916
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,190
Dewey?

917
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,660
My wife sends her love...

918
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:21,100
...asshole.

919
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:25,870
Dewey, tall and powerful

920
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:30,740
Dewey, I don't know if you can
hear me in there...

921
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,810
...but the wrong kid died.

922
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:39,280
Dewey. Do you mind
if we get stoned in here?

923
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:43,020
He can't hear you.
He's gonna die anyway.

924
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:04,310
Are you ready to go home,
Dewey Cox?

925
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,250
Darlene.

926
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,880
I could never get you
out of my head.

927
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:14,850
Me neither.

928
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,290
I could never stop
thinking about you.

929
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,260
But I wasn't gonna be
no home wrecker.

930
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:24,900
Now that I'm your only wife though,
it seems different.

931
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:29,970
I'm a new man, Darlene.
Prison and rehab have changed me.

932
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:33,240
All these blankets
have saved my life.

933
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:37,310
I think you're finally ready to be
the man I always thought you could be.

934
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,980
Let me get this off.

935
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,430
I love you.

936
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:28,690
I love you too.

937
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:41,910
Oh, my God.

938
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:52,050
Oh, don't stop.

939
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:55,620
Don't stop. Don't stop, Dewey.

940
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:57,320
Oh, God.

941
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,930
Oh, yes!

942
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,680
Hey, boys, have you seen Dewey?

943
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,400
I think I saw him in the barn
with Wavy Gravy

944
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,480
I saw him by the creek
talking to Donovan.

945
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:23,280
No, I think he was painting
a portrait with Joni Mitchell.

946
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,930
Jerry Garcia, brother,
have you seen Dewey?

947
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:33,500
I think I saw him in the study,
Sister Darlene.

948
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,360
Thanks, Jerry Garcia.

949
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:40,500
Hey! Casey, Jones,
watch your speed.

950
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:49,170
Come on, Dewey. It's almost time
for Dewman's cake.

951
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:53,910
All right. It's just... It's hard for me
to sit around at some birthday party...

952
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:57,140
...when I know there's so much
injustice going on in this world.

953
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,450
- I know.
- My daddy was right.

954
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:02,390
I can't spend all my time
thinking about Dewey Cox no more.

955
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:04,430
I've got to think about
the other people.

956
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:05,920
Like your family?

957
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:11,360
No, I mean, like, people that's having
injustices done to them.

958
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:13,830
Like women and midgets and such.

959
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:17,530
I mean, it's 1966, Darlene.
And, baby...

960
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,440
...l'm feeling it.

961
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,250
I know. The '60s are an important
and exciting time.

962
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:29,750
Aren't they? It's like there's
something happening here.

963
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:33,580
And what it is ain't exactly...

964
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,250
...obvious.

965
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:39,120
I have to try to help people
with my music.

966
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:43,390
Some people are saying that your new
music sounds a lot like Bob Dylan.

967
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,570
Well, maybe Bob Dylan
sounds a lot like me.

968
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:47,500
How come nobody
ever asks Bob Dylan:

969
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,610
"Why you sound
so much like Dewey Cox?"

970
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:55,300
Mailboxes drip like lampposts in
The twisted birth canal of the coliseum

971
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:01,420
Rimjob fairy teapots
Mask the temper tantrum

972
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,750
Oh, say can you see 'em?

973
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:08,760
Stuffed cabbage is the darling
Of the Laundromat

974
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:13,630
The mouse with the overbite explained
How the rabbits were ensnared

975
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,260
What the hell is this song about?

976
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:18,060
I have no idea.

977
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:22,570
You guys are idiots.
This song is very deep.

978
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:29,180
Inside the three-eyed monkey
Within inches of his toaster-oven life

979
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:31,780
What do your parents think about
your protest songs?

980
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:35,350
What do your parents think about
my protest songs, Mr. TIME Magazine?

981
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:40,360
All the elevator buttons

982
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,350
So incredibly high

983
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,550
I stand today for the midget

984
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:51,820
Half the size of a regular guy

985
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,370
Let me hold you, little man

986
01:01:56,570 --> 01:01:59,570
As the parade passes by

987
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:03,570
Let me hold you, little man

988
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,410
We'll make believe you can fly

989
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:09,350
You shout for me to put you down

990
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,950
But I'm marching today
For your cause

991
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:18,990
I'm banging the drum
Your big day will come

992
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,790
When they remake The Wizard of Oz

993
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:28,530
So let me hold you, midget man

994
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:32,370
Pretend that you're flying in space

995
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:36,240
Let me hold you, midget man

996
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:39,250
So the dog will stop licking your face

997
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,750
Sing with me!

998
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,550
Sing it!

999
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,750
Mr. Cox, why are you going to India?

1000
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,860
Well, I'm searching for something,
if you must know.

1001
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:53,530
I'm fixing to do some meditating
with the maharishi.

1002
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:56,200
And Dewey Cox needs India
right now...

1003
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,390
...and, heck, I reckon India
needs Dewey Cox too.

1004
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:06,800
Only through meditation can we
begin to understand our role.

1005
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:11,080
We're nothing but grains of sand.

1006
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,680
That was freaking transcendental,
Paul McCartney.

1007
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:16,250
- Don't you agree, John Lennon?
- Yes, Dewey Cox.

1008
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:19,820
With meditation there's no limit
to what we can...

1009
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:21,390
...imagine.

1010
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:23,390
What do you think, George Harrison?

1011
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:27,290
I don't know. I'm just trying to get some
more songs on the album, you know.

1012
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,760
And as Ringo Starr,
I'm not so interested in meditation.

1013
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:33,030
I just like to have fun.

1014
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:36,640
- I like the little one.
- It's so dark in this tent.

1015
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,300
Reminds me when we, the Beatles,
the four Beatles, us...

1016
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:42,600
- From Liverpool.
- Yes, we are from Liverpool.

1017
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:46,770
We used to play those dark clubs
in Hamburg. Remember that, Paul?

1018
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:51,280
Of course I do, I booked them.
I'm the leader of the Beatles.

1019
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:54,520
Well, I have to say I like your stuff.
It's pretty good.

1020
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,990
And most of your records,
I really enjoy.

1021
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,100
We're big fans of your records too.

1022
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:02,320
We like to think that Hard Day's Night
is our Guilty as Charged.

1023
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:04,470
- Great record.
- Excellent album.

1024
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:06,660
- We learned a lot from you.
- Great record.

1025
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:08,500
- We're big fans of y'all.
- Huge fans.

1026
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:11,300
You're almost as good as the Monkees.
You guys are great.

1027
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,470
I think I might adjourn to another
dimension, take some LSD.

1028
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,080
- Do you care to join me?
- Yeah, let's do that.

1029
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,750
Care to join us for some LSD?
It's good for you.

1030
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:25,320
- Built by scientists, it is.
- Lysergic.

1031
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,580
Gotta check with headquarters.

1032
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:29,990
Come on, Dewey Cox.
Think you might enjoy it.

1033
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:33,690
Open your mind to a new experience,
a new level of consciousness...

1034
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,760
...like we do,
because we are the Beatles.

1035
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:38,630
Let him decide.
If he wants to take LSD, he'll take it.

1036
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:41,030
He doesn't have to listen to you.
You're not the boss of him.

1037
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,800
Don't tell me what to say
and what not to say, Paul McCartney.

1038
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:48,340
I'm sick of you being so dark when I'm
so impish and whimsical. I'm sick of it.

1039
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:51,740
Hey, everyone,
I've got a brand-new mantra:

1040
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:53,510
Paul's a big fat cunt.

1041
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:56,050
Don't know why you
don't let me write more songs.

1042
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:59,660
You know, I just sit here while me
guitar quietly whimpers, you know.

1043
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:02,450
You are the quiet one,
so why don't you shut the fuck up?

1044
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:04,360
I've got a song about an octopus.

1045
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,500
Jam it up your ass. You're lucky
we still let you play drums.

1046
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:11,460
Wow, seems like there's a rift
happening between the Beatles.

1047
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:14,660
I wonder if your songs will
still be shit when I'm 64.

1048
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:16,310
- Great sod.
- No, stop it!

1049
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:17,840
You bastard! You sissy.

1050
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:21,310
Beatles. Please stop fighting
here in India.

1051
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:23,500
No, no, let them go.
Let them work it out.

1052
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:24,700
Taste it.

1053
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,510
Right there in the bollocks.

1054
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:29,250
- Bastard!
- Cunt!

1055
01:05:30,090 --> 01:05:32,890
Dewey, you been living clean
for three years now...

1056
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:35,320
...and it's done you a world of good,
has it not?

1057
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:37,620
I know I've had trouble
with drugs in the past.

1058
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:42,390
But I'm addicted to coke, weed, booze,
ludes and speed. Not LSD.

1059
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,970
Nobody gets addicted to LSD.

1060
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:48,000
It was invented by scientists.
Ringo Starr just told me.

1061
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:51,000
I heard that doing LSD
can awaken your demons.

1062
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:55,130
I ain't got no demons
gonna get woke.

1063
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:59,850
If you promise
it'll just be this one time.

1064
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,480
Okay.

1065
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:06,420
Let's go drop acid with the Beatles.

1066
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:18,090
Hello, Dewey.

1067
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:21,030
Welcome to your LSD trip.

1068
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,540
Where everything's a cartoon.

1069
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:26,300
We're the trippy cartoon Beatles.

1070
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:29,070
Look at that. It's a flying fish.

1071
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,980
Totally trippy!

1072
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,680
Wow, this LSD's all right.

1073
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,980
I like being a trippy cartoon.

1074
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:39,750
Just keep thinking
happy thoughts, Dewey.

1075
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:43,090
I'd hate for this
to turn into a bad trip.

1076
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:46,690
What's that scary music?

1077
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:50,030
I had an unhappy thought.

1078
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:51,670
It's a bad trip.

1079
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:53,360
Bad trip, bad trip!

1080
01:06:53,570 --> 01:06:56,510
Help! Trippy machete!

1081
01:06:57,610 --> 01:07:00,670
Oh, fuck me.
I can see my large colon.

1082
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:03,780
I guess I do have some demons.

1083
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:05,470
You all right, Cox?

1084
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,950
I don't know.

1085
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:09,590
Do you want some more LSD?

1086
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:12,620
Yeah. I think I do.

1087
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:22,730
Mr. Schwartzberg, you're his long-time
manager. Maybe you can talk to him.

1088
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:24,630
Well, what's the problem?

1089
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,400
He's been on that trampoline
for four days.

1090
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:30,630
You have got to talk some sense
into him. I'm worried.

1091
01:07:32,410 --> 01:07:36,610
Dewey, as your manager,
I have to tell you I'm concerned.

1092
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:38,980
I think the LSD has changed you.

1093
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,740
It has changed me.
It's opened my mind right up.

1094
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:44,420
I'm reinventing music.

1095
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:47,680
I'm creating something new
that I call "shmusic."

1096
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:51,380
You've recorded the same song for
months. You're not close to finished.

1097
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,220
Because this record is different
than any other I've made.

1098
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:56,870
I told you. This is going to be
my masterpiece.

1099
01:07:57,070 --> 01:07:59,300
The one I'm remembered by.
It's for my brother.

1100
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:00,630
What brother?

1101
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,310
Nothing. Never mind. It's private.

1102
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:06,270
I've got this sound in my head
and it's trying to get out.

1103
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,040
I can't find it on this human plane of
existence. I've got to keep searching.

1104
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:14,850
But I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna find it.

1105
01:08:22,930 --> 01:08:25,590
You guys should make friends.
He's a wonderful man.

1106
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:29,250
Professor, good morning.
All right, everyone. Thank you.

1107
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:31,830
I've just been outside,
I had a little bounce.

1108
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:35,030
What we're going to do is
run through the entire piece...

1109
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,140
...in our minds, silently.

1110
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:39,310
And...

1111
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:40,840
...begin.

1112
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:43,710
As we sit here together
on Thanksgiving...

1113
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:45,680
...on our beautiful trampoline...

1114
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:50,010
...I think we should take a moment to
think about what it's like to be a turkey.

1115
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:53,050
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

1116
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:55,090
"Hi, I'm just a little turkey."

1117
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:57,820
Just cut the damn bird, boy.

1118
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:02,330
Dewey? Can we just enjoy
our Thanksgiving dinner?

1119
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:07,130
You think you're so great
sitting there all drugged up...

1120
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:09,140
...on your trampoline.

1121
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:11,540
You're the black sheep
of this family.

1122
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:13,740
You call yourself a Cox.

1123
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:15,840
Until you get right with Jesus...

1124
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:20,010
...you'll never be nothing
but a big, black Cox.

1125
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,710
Nothing I do will ever please you,
will it?

1126
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:30,090
We're both Cox, Pa.
Both of us are Cox.

1127
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:33,700
I've got 137 musicians
waiting on me.

1128
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:35,890
You'll have to excuse me.

1129
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:37,930
Dewey, watch the turkey.

1130
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:46,700
I wasn't dreaming

1131
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:48,540
Barely awake

1132
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:52,580
Off to the grinder we stroll

1133
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,280
This is not a good song.

1134
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:58,980
It's like five songs on top
of each other at the same time.

1135
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:01,920
Not even a song.
It's some kind of concerto.

1136
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,390
Just let him work it out.

1137
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:06,120
Masterpieces take time.

1138
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:09,360
Do you hear that?
That goat's been singing...

1139
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:11,970
...more than I am on this damn song.

1140
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:18,670
Well?

1141
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,670
That was beautiful, Dewey.
It was perfection.

1142
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,470
Yeah, even the goat was perfect.

1143
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:27,210
Yeah, the goat was good.
Were the strings tangy enough?

1144
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:29,410
Oh, they were tangy.
They were very tangy.

1145
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:31,320
Unbelievably tangy.

1146
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,490
No, guys, the strings were not tangy!
They were salty!

1147
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:36,220
Am I crazy?

1148
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:38,950
Let's do one more time.
Okay, strings, lean into it.

1149
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:42,000
I want it really tangy this time.
Now, Mike, you're flatting.

1150
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:46,190
Bushmen, make it sound like
you're in the fucking bush, okay?

1151
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,500
Back off the goat
on the second pre-chorus.

1152
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:50,470
I wanna hear his heart, not his soul.

1153
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:53,540
Sam, go back to that thing you did
yesterday on the bridge.

1154
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:57,010
- What did I do?
- It sounded like velvet pancakes.

1155
01:10:57,210 --> 01:10:59,880
- Yeah, right.
- Okay, everybody, one more time.

1156
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,350
What on earth is a velvet pancake?

1157
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:07,320
It's the LSD.
I think it's having an effect on him.

1158
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,390
From the top of the overture.
Slate it.

1159
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,860
"Black Sheep," take 112.

1160
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:17,160
One, and a two,
and a five, six, seven, eight.

1161
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:22,800
I just close my eyes
When I fantasize

1162
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:26,240
Much to my surprise
I'm only half the size

1163
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,310
That I used to be

1164
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:33,510
Bye-bye, white brother

1165
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:37,310
This black sheep gotta roll

1166
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,650
It's on the beat!

1167
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,890
I just open up
Like a catacomb

1168
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:46,930
Though my heart is half
From the half-F tone

1169
01:11:47,730 --> 01:11:49,630
That tickles.

1170
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:55,030
Bye-bye, pastures of plenty

1171
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:58,840
I don't know where I will

1172
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,670
- Roam
- Black sheep, black sheep

1173
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:04,410
Like that, with some urgency.

1174
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:08,050
Not, "I'm in the yard.
I wanna go outside."

1175
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:12,690
Like, "I'm about to die." Like that.

1176
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:14,620
The blade has been swung

1177
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:17,590
Black sheep, black sheep

1178
01:12:19,730 --> 01:12:21,630
All right? Here we go.

1179
01:12:23,230 --> 01:12:25,290
Push. Push, baby, push.

1180
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,270
- Are we recording this?
- No.

1181
01:12:27,470 --> 01:12:30,740
Well, we should be. Get a microphone.
Push, baby.

1182
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:32,310
Push.

1183
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:34,600
Push! Push!

1184
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:39,780
I'm losin' my fleece from tryin'

1185
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:43,280
I'm losin' no sleep
I'm dyin'

1186
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:47,650
Why shouldn't I keep from cryin'?

1187
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:50,520
Cryin'

1188
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:54,030
I'm losin' my fleece from tryin'

1189
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:57,560
I'm losin' no sleep
I'm dyin'

1190
01:12:57,770 --> 01:13:01,070
Why shouldn't I keep from cry?

1191
01:13:06,410 --> 01:13:08,400
It's still not finished yet.

1192
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:12,610
I'm hearing more
aboriginal percussionists.

1193
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:17,450
And I want an army of didgeridoos.
Fifty thousand didgeridoos!

1194
01:13:17,650 --> 01:13:19,710
Folks, can we have a moment
with Dewey?

1195
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:25,020
What the hell are these songs about?

1196
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:27,530
You're singing about
cutting people in half...

1197
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:32,630
I'm working something out.
It's called a metaphor.

1198
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,270
Well, what are you working out?

1199
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:36,770
It's secret.
That's why it's called metaphor.

1200
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:38,700
That's what metaphor means. Secret.

1201
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:42,010
I just don't see why you gotta
throw away the recipe, is all.

1202
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:46,310
Why don't we just go in there, lay down
some tracks like we always done?

1203
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:49,080
Yeah, why can't we just walk hard?

1204
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:51,120
What do we need
all these people for?

1205
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:54,920
I don't need people around me
stifling me.

1206
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:58,460
So if you don't like it,
there's the door.

1207
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:01,190
Dewey?

1208
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:04,090
Are you saying
you don't need us no more?

1209
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:10,040
Not unless you can open your mind
and learn to play the fucking theremin.

1210
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,970
Fuck you, Dewey!

1211
01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:16,780
Yeah, fuck you, Dewey.

1212
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:19,540
In 20 years not once have you
thrown a woman my way.

1213
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:22,080
You don't think we like
cheating on our wives too?

1214
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:25,280
And you never once paid for drugs.
Not once!

1215
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:28,460
You pay that chimp
more than you pay us.

1216
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:31,490
I had to borrow from the chimp
to get a mortgage on my house.

1217
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:35,890
And those stupid Siamese glass cats
you get us every year for Christmas.

1218
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:38,930
I don't want any more
Siamese glass cats!

1219
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:42,130
The Siamese cat is a symbol of nobility
in ancient Egypt.

1220
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:43,330
Fuck nobility!

1221
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:45,410
Fuck ancient Egypt.

1222
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:47,310
Fuck cats!

1223
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:49,980
And you never paid for drugs.

1224
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:51,650
Not once.

1225
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:53,480
You slept with my wife.

1226
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:54,880
You slept with me too!

1227
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:58,320
And I've had confused feelings
about that for 10 years now!

1228
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,920
And you never once paid for drugs.

1229
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:03,290
Not once.

1230
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:05,620
You're on your own, Dewey Cox.

1231
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:07,360
We're leaving.

1232
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:14,060
Well, I guess this is the end of
a chapter in your life, Dewey Cox.

1233
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:30,380
What's happened to you,
Dewey Cox?

1234
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:31,920
Stay out of this, Darlene!

1235
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,590
You're driving away the people
who love you most!

1236
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:36,820
I don't need anybody, Darlene.

1237
01:15:37,190 --> 01:15:39,090
All I need is my music.

1238
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:44,390
This ain't about your music, Dewey.
It's about the drugs.

1239
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:47,330
Honey, I told you
I'm gonna quit again.

1240
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:49,830
As soon as the record's done.
Whenever that is.

1241
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:51,740
Look, you can't rush a masterpiece.

1242
01:15:55,310 --> 01:15:58,510
You need to take a break. You need
to clean yourself up, otherwise...

1243
01:15:58,720 --> 01:15:59,910
Otherwise what?

1244
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:02,590
Otherwise I can't be married
to you no more.

1245
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:05,520
I know you don't mean that.

1246
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,220
I believe you know that I do.

1247
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:14,730
Okay.

1248
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:18,630
- Okay?
- Okay.

1249
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:20,760
You'll take a break?

1250
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:23,070
I will take a break.

1251
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:24,910
And you'll quit the drugs?

1252
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:27,670
And I will quit the drugs.

1253
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:29,970
Dewey!

1254
01:16:30,910 --> 01:16:35,350
Oh, baby. I've been praying
about this day for so long.

1255
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:38,350
- What did you just put in your mouth?
- Gum.

1256
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:42,290
- You ain't chewing no gum.
- Candy?

1257
01:16:42,490 --> 01:16:45,390
- What did you put in your mouth?
- It's PCP.

1258
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,790
Oh, you just said!

1259
01:16:50,830 --> 01:16:53,060
I'm going to town!

1260
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:01,110
Get out of the road, you jerk!

1261
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:03,070
Hey!

1262
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:05,740
Hey! What's going on?

1263
01:17:16,690 --> 01:17:17,660
There he is!

1264
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:27,090
Dewey! Get off that building!
It's inappropriate!

1265
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:33,870
Dewey Cox, you give me no choice.

1266
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:38,950
It breaks my heart,
but I'm leaving you.

1267
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:40,410
I'm Zeus!

1268
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:45,950
No mortal can stop me! I'm Zeus!

1269
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:52,090
- Rehab?
- Rehab.

1270
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:03,160
Nate!

1271
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:08,800
Nate?

1272
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:11,170
This is what I'd look like
if I'd grown up...

1273
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:14,080
...and perhaps hadn't been murdered,
or whatever.

1274
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:18,080
I just came to tell you
you need to get your shit together!

1275
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:19,780
I know.

1276
01:18:19,990 --> 01:18:21,460
I've fallen again.

1277
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:23,960
Listen to yourself.
Whining like a little bitch.

1278
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:27,860
If I was alive right now, I'd be the
fucking president of the United States.

1279
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:31,160
I'd be on the moon, walking around
looking for aliens to kill.

1280
01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:34,030
- What?
- You know why Dad liked me better?

1281
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:36,030
Because I was better than you.

1282
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:38,540
When I played the piano,
I was fucking awesome.

1283
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:40,710
Well, you think
it's been easy for me?

1284
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:42,900
Since you're gone
I got no sense of smell.

1285
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:44,770
Oh, you got no sense of smell?

1286
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:49,120
You can't smell anything?
You can't smell anything?

1287
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:51,750
I got no sense of having legs,
Dewey!

1288
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:55,190
I have no life!
I'm dead because somebody...

1289
01:18:55,390 --> 01:18:57,420
...l'm not gonna point out
names right now...

1290
01:18:57,630 --> 01:18:59,490
...decided to murder me
with a machete.

1291
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:02,430
- Nate.
- I can't even smell, touch, feel.

1292
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:06,530
I can't even masturbate. You ever try
to jerk off with a ghost hand? Nothing!

1293
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:11,210
I'm just trying to say
you need to fix this shit.

1294
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:14,670
You need to get out of that bathtub.
Start writing songs again.

1295
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:22,120
Is he almost done
thinking about his life?

1296
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:25,020
He just reached the '70s.

1297
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:46,940
Schwartzy, I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know what's going on with me.

1298
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:48,410
I got the song block.

1299
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:49,640
Song block.

1300
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:51,840
I don't need to write any new songs.

1301
01:19:52,050 --> 01:19:55,480
I'll just do my old ones. We'll do
a oldies tour. I'll do "Walk Hard."

1302
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:58,520
Dewey, "Walk Hard"
is over 20 years old.

1303
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:01,020
Well, a lot of people like
my old songs.

1304
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:03,060
Old people like your old songs.

1305
01:20:03,730 --> 01:20:04,820
May I make a suggestion?

1306
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:07,050
Are you familiar with
the Donny & Marie show?

1307
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:10,460
- The television show?
- I got a call from CBS.

1308
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:13,260
They wanna do the same kind
of show with you.

1309
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:16,930
I'm a serious musician.
I'm not some TV personality.

1310
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:20,540
Well, why can't you be both? Look
at those goofy bastards on Hee Haw.

1311
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:22,440
Well, I do love Hee Haw.

1312
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:25,770
Television, Dewey. It's the way
into the people's hearts.

1313
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:29,440
All right. You call them back today...

1314
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:32,020
...and you tell Mr. CBS...

1315
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:35,780
...that I will do it if I have
total creative control.

1316
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:38,550
Dewey, you can't have
any creative control.

1317
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:41,560
Okay.

1318
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:44,730
All right, let's just do it then.
Fuck it, let's do it.

1319
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,260
I'm bored.

1320
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:50,200
Live from Burbank, California.

1321
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:52,340
It's The Dewey Cox Show.

1322
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:57,610
And now your host, Dewey Cox!

1323
01:20:57,810 --> 01:20:59,910
- Walk hard
- Hard

1324
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:01,640
- Hard
- Hard

1325
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:04,950
Down life's rocky road

1326
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:07,720
- Walk bold
- Bold

1327
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,290
- Hard
- Hard

1328
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:11,460
That's my creed

1329
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:13,490
My code

1330
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:15,760
I been scorned and slandered
And ridiculed too

1331
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:19,630
Had to suffer every day
My whole life through

1332
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:23,640
Seen my share of the worst
That the world can give

1333
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,770
But I still got a dream
And a burnin' rage to live

1334
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:31,510
Walk hard

1335
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:34,240
Walk hard

1336
01:21:36,190 --> 01:21:38,650
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the show.

1337
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:40,080
We've got a great one.

1338
01:21:40,290 --> 01:21:43,090
To get things rolling,
I'd like to bring out my first guest...

1339
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:47,700
...a model I think is pretty super:
Miss Cheryl Tiegs.

1340
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:54,040
Well, hello, Cheryl.
Don't you look lovely tonight.

1341
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,260
Well, thanks so much, sir.
So do you.

1342
01:21:56,470 --> 01:22:00,710
Cheryl, you know, you remind me
of a 1977 Corvette.

1343
01:22:00,910 --> 01:22:02,040
Why is that?

1344
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:04,110
Because you're
a beautiful new model.

1345
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:09,050
Just kidding.

1346
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:16,520
Would you do me the honor
of joining me for a song?

1347
01:22:16,730 --> 01:22:19,350
Well, I thought you'd never ask,
Mr. Cox.

1348
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,830
Baby, come as you are
With just your heart

1349
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:29,070
And I'll take you in

1350
01:22:30,110 --> 01:22:32,130
You're rejected and hurt

1351
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:37,510
To me you're worth
What you have within

1352
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:41,450
You don't have to be a star, baby

1353
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:44,820
To be in my show

1354
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:48,950
Good night, everybody.
We'll see you next week.

1355
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:55,790
Good show.

1356
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:01,600
- You ready, Dewey?
- Yes, I'm ready.

1357
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:06,800
"Who Wants to Party?"
Dewey, lead vocal, take one.

1358
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:13,910
Hey, hey
Who wants to party?

1359
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:17,990
Hey, hey
Who wants to party?

1360
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:22,560
Hey, hey
Who wants to party now?

1361
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:27,020
I don't know. I'll see you in a minute.

1362
01:23:27,230 --> 01:23:30,220
All right. Everybody good?
Everybody good?

1363
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:32,260
Whoa, Dewey.
Great party, great party.

1364
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:35,770
Thanks, Patrick Duffy from Dallas.
Listen, mingle, enjoy yourself.

1365
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:38,870
- Have sex with anybody you want.
- Well, can do.

1366
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,470
- Hey!
- Dewey!

1367
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:44,700
Oh, my God, your show is such a hit.
You beat McCloud last week.

1368
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:48,510
Well, thank you, Morgan Fairchild,
but I never pay attention to the ratings.

1369
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:51,380
Just kidding. We're gonna
take a shit on Donnie & Marie.

1370
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:53,150
- Oh, you do that, honey.
- Yes.

1371
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:57,120
Hey, you. Are you gonna
save a dance for me, Dewey?

1372
01:23:57,330 --> 01:23:59,800
Well, you bet,
Cheryl Ladd from Charlie's Angels.

1373
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,930
Hey there, Little Miss Cox-Tiegs.

1374
01:24:02,130 --> 01:24:04,100
Have you met my new wife,
Cheryl Cox-Tiegs?

1375
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:06,290
We've met, yes.

1376
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:08,700
Isn't that funny?
You're both named Cheryl.

1377
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:11,140
Yeah. We're aware of that.

1378
01:24:12,410 --> 01:24:13,930
That is hilarious.

1379
01:24:14,210 --> 01:24:17,610
Hey, hey
Who wants to party?

1380
01:24:17,810 --> 01:24:20,110
I don't know what they're
talking about with this energy crisis.

1381
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:23,580
Because I have plenty of energy,
all right? I am loaded with energy.

1382
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:28,180
Look, I gave up politics
a long time ago.

1383
01:24:28,390 --> 01:24:31,830
You know, let somebody else march.
I wanna play Frisbee.

1384
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:35,420
I'm on the beach.
I'm not marching on the beach.

1385
01:24:35,630 --> 01:24:37,960
Billy, don't be a hero

1386
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:41,140
Don't be a fool with your life

1387
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:46,310
Do me, Dewey.

1388
01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:53,940
I can't, Cheryl Ladd,
I'm married to Cheryl Tiegs.

1389
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:57,210
Oh, I should've been your guest star
last week instead of her.

1390
01:24:57,420 --> 01:24:59,790
It could've been me.

1391
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:02,490
"It could've been me."

1392
01:25:02,690 --> 01:25:06,420
It could have been me
Could've been me

1393
01:25:06,630 --> 01:25:08,220
Stay in it. Stay in it.

1394
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:16,100
It could've been me

1395
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:19,710
Rocky ro...

1396
01:25:20,410 --> 01:25:23,170
No! You're repeating yourself!

1397
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:27,840
Why can't I write
a fucking song anymore?

1398
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:31,550
I love the nightlife
I got to boogie

1399
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:34,550
On the disco 'round

1400
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:35,990
Oh, yeah

1401
01:25:36,190 --> 01:25:39,030
I told you
I love the nightlife

1402
01:25:39,230 --> 01:25:40,490
I got to boogie

1403
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:44,190
On the disco 'round
Oh, yeah

1404
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,770
I'll tell you, I've never been
so truly satisfied.

1405
01:25:47,970 --> 01:25:50,940
Living here in this beautiful
beach house with you...

1406
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:53,630
...my beautiful Cheryl Cox-Tiegs.

1407
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:56,970
The ratings are great.
These are the salad days.

1408
01:25:57,180 --> 01:26:01,780
Yeah, I've been looking for something
my whole life, and this is it.

1409
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:04,880
I'm finally truly satisfied.

1410
01:26:10,390 --> 01:26:14,060
Goodbye, love

1411
01:26:14,830 --> 01:26:18,290
Goodbye, love

1412
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:22,340
You are not going home.
You are sleeping in the guestroom.

1413
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:24,230
Forever.

1414
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:26,470
Because you're the only one
who stuck around.

1415
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:28,670
Everyone else got sick of it
and left...

1416
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,570
...but you stuck around,
which means you're my friend.

1417
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:41,320
There's a starman waiting in the sky

1418
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,250
He'd like to come and meet us

1419
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:45,120
But he thinks he'd blow our minds

1420
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:49,490
There's a starman waiting in the sky

1421
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:53,190
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile

1422
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:54,600
He told me

1423
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,100
Let the children use it
Let the children lose it

1424
01:26:58,310 --> 01:27:00,470
Let all the children boogie

1425
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:02,970
Goddamn it!

1426
01:27:04,110 --> 01:27:07,140
I mean, what do I have to do
to get you on my bone? Invent fire?

1427
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:10,880
And then huge laugh and we go
to commercial. All right, take five.

1428
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:12,950
Hey.

1429
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,550
Great rehearsal, Dewey.
Very funny sketch.

1430
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,850
Thank you.
Have you seen the ratings?

1431
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:20,660
We're getting our ass kicked
by The Incredible Hulk.

1432
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:23,860
Well, last night's episode
was a very special episode.

1433
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:26,970
They revealed that the Incredible Hulk
has an evil twin.

1434
01:27:27,170 --> 01:27:28,830
And he's not green. He's red.

1435
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,130
I know. It was amazing.
Did you see it?

1436
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:34,330
You can't compete with that.
But we do need to do more promotion.

1437
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:38,210
Here's what we'll do. We'll introduce
people to the new Dewey Cox.

1438
01:27:38,410 --> 01:27:42,320
I got a girl here to interview you.
She's from the local affiliate in Dallas.

1439
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:46,520
I don't know.
I'm not so good on interviews.

1440
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,990
Bubbe, it's a puff piece.
It's very puffy.

1441
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:51,160
All you have to do
is remind the audience...

1442
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:55,200
...you're not mainlining acid anymore.
And the show, it's a lot of fun, right?

1443
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,560
- You're having fun.
- Yeah.

1444
01:27:56,770 --> 01:27:59,230
It's on every Thursday night
after the local news.

1445
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:03,300
"It's on every Thursday night after your
local news. I'm not mainlining acid."

1446
01:28:03,510 --> 01:28:05,630
- Anymore.
- Oh, I'm not gonna promise that.

1447
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:09,040
- Whatever you're comfortable with.
- "I don't smoke angel dust anymore.

1448
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:11,270
So don't be afraid."
Something like that?

1449
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:13,880
Why don't you tell us about
your new TV program?

1450
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,850
Gail, it's a variety show.
I do a little bit of everything.

1451
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:19,820
I do some singing, some dancing,
chatting with the guests...

1452
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:22,120
...the skits, the monologues,
the comedy.

1453
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:23,880
Wonderful. Comedy.

1454
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:26,490
It really is a lot of fun.

1455
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:30,560
We'll have more fun when we come
back from this word from our sponsors.

1456
01:28:30,770 --> 01:28:32,100
Don't go away.

1457
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:37,830
Okay, you know what, I gotta tell you,
my heart goes out to you.

1458
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:41,410
I know what it's like to be on
a piece-of-shit television program...

1459
01:28:41,610 --> 01:28:44,580
...because I'm hosting one right now.
- Excuse me?

1460
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:47,880
Must wanna blow your fucking
brains out, I'll bet. I know I do.

1461
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:51,210
And we're back
with Mr. Dewey Cox.

1462
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:53,910
We're talking about the fun
he's having on his show.

1463
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:58,360
But right now, let's talk about your
lovely wife, Darlene. How's she doing?

1464
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:01,030
Darlene and I separated
some years ago, Gail.

1465
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:03,560
Oh, okay. Guess I didn't
do my homework.

1466
01:29:03,770 --> 01:29:06,030
And to answer your question,
I miss her terribly.

1467
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,500
Well, that's sweet.

1468
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:10,870
Why don't we talk about your parents?
They've gotta be proud of you.

1469
01:29:11,410 --> 01:29:13,400
Well, my mom is dead.

1470
01:29:13,610 --> 01:29:18,440
And my pa and I don't
speak to each other...

1471
01:29:18,650 --> 01:29:20,780
...so we're not very close.

1472
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:25,210
We can always cut around this
if it gets too pathetic.

1473
01:29:25,420 --> 01:29:28,550
Tell us about your kids.
I know you got a whole slew of them.

1474
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:31,480
I'm locked in a custody battle
at this time.

1475
01:29:31,690 --> 01:29:34,600
Custody is being forced upon me,
which I don't think is right.

1476
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,790
You know, if you don't want
the responsibility of children...

1477
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,970
...you should be able to walk away...

1478
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:44,400
...and apparently a couple of my
ex-wives don't feel the same. So, yeah.

1479
01:29:44,610 --> 01:29:47,080
Wherever my kids are, they're watching
The Dewey Cox Show...

1480
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:50,110
...on Thursday nights at 8:00,
right after the local news.

1481
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:52,780
And I just wanted to say
to everyone out there...

1482
01:29:52,980 --> 01:29:55,780
...l'm no longer mainlining acid
or smoking PCP.

1483
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:57,480
It's official.

1484
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:01,650
Okay. Why don't we lighten it up
just a bit here?

1485
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:05,950
You're so busy, Dewey Cox, do you
have time to stop and smell the roses?

1486
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:08,460
I've got no fucking sense of smell.

1487
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:09,950
All right, I'm done.

1488
01:30:10,170 --> 01:30:14,360
- Come on, folks. Do a little research.
- That would've been nice information.

1489
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:18,570
I'm sorry, I must be tired
from the show or something.

1490
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:21,470
- It's okay.
- Yeah, Dewey, it's okay.

1491
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:24,480
No, it's not okay.
I should be able to do this.

1492
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,510
We're in no rush.

1493
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:29,240
Should we get an
American Indian woman?

1494
01:30:29,450 --> 01:30:33,250
No, that won't help. I mean,
it should already be pretty exciting.

1495
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:35,520
There's three of you.

1496
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:37,550
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1497
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:42,660
Yeah.

1498
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,660
- Dewey.
- Nate?

1499
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:50,330
You were supposed to be double great.
What the fuck is this bullshit?

1500
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:52,630
- I know.
- All I'm asking...

1501
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:54,710
...is that you write one
masterpiece...

1502
01:30:54,910 --> 01:30:57,440
...that is the culmination
of your entire life.

1503
01:30:57,650 --> 01:30:58,640
How hard is that?

1504
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:02,450
I'm empty, Nate. What do I do?

1505
01:31:02,650 --> 01:31:07,390
Dewey, who's the one person in your
life who's made you feel like shit?

1506
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:09,960
- Pa.
- You need to talk to him, Dewey.

1507
01:31:10,830 --> 01:31:13,190
- I don't know.
- You need to hug him.

1508
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:17,730
I have been putting this off
my entire life...

1509
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:20,600
...but I think you might be right.

1510
01:31:22,970 --> 01:31:25,410
The wrong kid died

1511
01:31:27,310 --> 01:31:29,210
Hello, Pa.

1512
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:34,550
What do you want?

1513
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:37,180
I feel like there's some things
I need to say to you.

1514
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:39,850
Well, go on. Talk.

1515
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:42,720
I've realized that...

1516
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:47,220
...I never really said I was sorry
for what happened with Nate.

1517
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:51,070
Pa, I've spent my entire life...

1518
01:31:51,270 --> 01:31:54,600
...trying to find love with wives...

1519
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,640
...and hotel clerks...

1520
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,900
...and tollbooth attendants...

1521
01:31:59,110 --> 01:32:02,240
...and giraffes and monkeys
and trampolines...

1522
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:05,510
...and men who dress like women
and men who look like you.

1523
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:11,250
And I realized the only person
I've ever really wanted to love me...

1524
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:14,390
...was you, Pa.

1525
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:18,890
Dewey, I don't know what to say.

1526
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:21,720
You don't have to say anything, Pa.

1527
01:32:21,930 --> 01:32:25,390
I just wanted to come here
and tell you that I loved you...

1528
01:32:26,070 --> 01:32:27,370
...and I always have.

1529
01:32:30,010 --> 01:32:35,240
I appreciate you finding the courage
to say that, Dewey.

1530
01:32:36,150 --> 01:32:38,610
But there's only one way
to settle this.

1531
01:32:40,950 --> 01:32:42,610
- Machetes.
- What?

1532
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:45,550
The right kid is gonna die tonight.

1533
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:50,860
You've been practicing!

1534
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:08,340
No, Pa. No!

1535
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:11,450
I been waiting for this
for a long time!

1536
01:33:11,650 --> 01:33:13,310
You have?

1537
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:21,050
Oh, no.

1538
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:23,490
Oh, my goodness!

1539
01:33:23,690 --> 01:33:25,320
I halved myself.

1540
01:33:25,530 --> 01:33:28,020
Pa! No, Pa!

1541
01:33:28,230 --> 01:33:32,760
Dewey, I guess I never realized
until this moment...

1542
01:33:32,970 --> 01:33:38,270
...just how easy it is to accidentally
cut someone in half.

1543
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:39,460
It is, right?

1544
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:41,940
I'm sorry for blaming you, Dewey.

1545
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:45,200
Of course you didn't mean
to cut Nate in half.

1546
01:33:45,410 --> 01:33:47,540
It's all so obvious now.

1547
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:48,940
Pa.

1548
01:33:49,150 --> 01:33:51,680
I should've been a better father
to you, Dewey.

1549
01:33:51,890 --> 01:33:55,480
I wish I spent more time
playing catch with you...

1550
01:33:55,690 --> 01:34:00,420
...and less time training my body
and mind to kill you in a machete fight.

1551
01:34:00,630 --> 01:34:03,900
You be a better father
than I was, Dewey.

1552
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:05,360
I'll try, Pa.

1553
01:34:05,570 --> 01:34:07,200
It shouldn't be that hard.

1554
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,600
In case I don't make it...

1555
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:12,300
Pa! You're gonna make it!
It's the 1970s!

1556
01:34:12,510 --> 01:34:16,100
They got all kinds of new procedures
that can attach tops to bottoms now!

1557
01:34:16,310 --> 01:34:18,540
Hang in there! You're gonna be fine!

1558
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:22,450
I reckon you're probably right.
Now, go call the doctor...

1559
01:34:22,650 --> 01:34:25,280
...and bring me some ice, a lot of ice.
- Some ice.

1560
01:34:25,490 --> 01:34:27,580
And a tourniquet.
Don't forget a tourniquet.

1561
01:34:27,790 --> 01:34:30,450
- All right, ice and a tourniquet?
- Ice and a tourniquet.

1562
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:33,060
- And a tourniquet.
- Don't forget that tourniquet.

1563
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:36,560
And you know those three words
you always wanted to hear, Dewey?

1564
01:34:36,770 --> 01:34:38,200
Well, here they are.

1565
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:39,970
I love...

1566
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:44,100
You love what?

1567
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:46,530
Pa, you love what?

1568
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,970
What was the third word?

1569
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:50,610
Come on, one more word!

1570
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:52,970
No!

1571
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:58,210
I want all you fucking parasites
out of my house...

1572
01:34:58,420 --> 01:34:59,750
...right now!

1573
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:02,690
I said, everybody out!

1574
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:06,090
Well, look at you,
you arrogant cocksucker.

1575
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:09,230
- How dare you.
- What happened to you, Dewey?

1576
01:35:09,430 --> 01:35:13,030
I don't know what's happened to me,
but I know what happened to you.

1577
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:15,000
Patrick Duffy took a beating.

1578
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:19,900
Stop it, Dewey, you son of a bitch.

1579
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:25,880
Stop it! Patrick Duffy was only
saying what we were all feeling.

1580
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:29,140
You get the hell away from me,
Cheryl Cox-Tiegs!

1581
01:35:32,990 --> 01:35:35,860
If you tear that sink off the wall,
I'm leaving you.

1582
01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:37,250
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1583
01:35:40,330 --> 01:35:42,760
I'm leaving you, Dewey Cox.

1584
01:35:43,230 --> 01:35:44,700
No!

1585
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:33,480
Dad?

1586
01:36:36,450 --> 01:36:38,940
Yes, what is it, son?

1587
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:41,950
I was just wondering
if you wanna have a catch.

1588
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:45,220
A catch?

1589
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:49,090
Son...

1590
01:36:49,630 --> 01:36:54,000
...there is nothing in this world
I want more...

1591
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:56,900
...than to have a catch with you.

1592
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:02,640
Son, forgive me,
this is going to sound strange...

1593
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:05,610
...but what is your name again?

1594
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:08,940
I'm Dewey Junior,
but my friends call me "Dewdrop."

1595
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:11,050
Well...

1596
01:37:15,090 --> 01:37:18,580
It's nice to formally meet you,
Dewdrop.

1597
01:37:18,860 --> 01:37:21,390
So this is catch.

1598
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:25,230
This is what I been missing out
on all them years on the road, huh?

1599
01:37:26,070 --> 01:37:29,830
I like it, it's wonderful. You throw
it to me, I throw it back to you.

1600
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:33,300
It's so simple, and yet so powerful.

1601
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:36,500
Boy, you're really terrible
at this game.

1602
01:37:36,710 --> 01:37:39,340
Well, I mean, you never really
played with me before.

1603
01:37:39,550 --> 01:37:42,950
How am I supposed to learn?
A boy needs a dad.

1604
01:37:43,450 --> 01:37:45,220
Yes, he does.

1605
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:49,620
Well, I reckon we got some lost time
to make up, you and me.

1606
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:52,590
And all your brothers and sisters.
How many of you are there?

1607
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:56,930
Twenty-two brothers and sisters. And
also 14 half-brothers and half-sisters.

1608
01:37:57,130 --> 01:37:59,000
Holy shit.

1609
01:37:59,570 --> 01:38:00,760
This may take a while.

1610
01:38:03,970 --> 01:38:05,670
That's real good.

1611
01:38:08,540 --> 01:38:10,030
So beautiful.

1612
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:17,580
Are you sure you're one of mine?

1613
01:38:42,210 --> 01:38:44,110
Go ahead and taste some dirt.

1614
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:45,910
That's good dirt. That's good dirt.

1615
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:49,050
On the surface,
Macbeth is about revenge.

1616
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:50,410
But what is the subtext?

1617
01:38:50,620 --> 01:38:53,750
A power struggle for the Scottish
royal family, that's what it is.

1618
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:55,820
I just gave you it.
That one's a mulligan.

1619
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:03,600
Yeah.

1620
01:39:17,010 --> 01:39:18,000
Hello, Dewey.

1621
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:20,610
Darlene.

1622
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:25,380
It's Dewina's birthday. I brought her
a present. It's a bracelet.

1623
01:39:26,620 --> 01:39:28,060
How's Glen Campbell?

1624
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:29,990
He and I split up a long time ago.

1625
01:39:30,790 --> 01:39:31,920
Really?

1626
01:39:32,290 --> 01:39:34,190
It's just me these days.

1627
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:35,760
At age 50.

1628
01:39:36,670 --> 01:39:39,660
Would you care to take a walk
with me, Darlene Madison?

1629
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:43,290
I haven't been playing much music.

1630
01:39:45,070 --> 01:39:49,440
I realize now I wasn't much of a father
when I was out on the road.

1631
01:39:49,810 --> 01:39:51,870
Now this is what makes me happy.

1632
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:55,880
Not the music, not getting high...

1633
01:39:56,090 --> 01:39:57,920
...just my family.

1634
01:39:58,120 --> 01:39:59,550
That's all I care about.

1635
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,450
And that family is missing one piece,
Darlene.

1636
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:06,420
My God, you're as beautiful
as the day I met you.

1637
01:40:11,830 --> 01:40:14,500
You don't want this dirty old Cox.

1638
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:16,470
Oh, I want it more than ever.

1639
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:22,080
Did you wash your hair today?

1640
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:24,970
I sure did. How could you tell?

1641
01:40:25,180 --> 01:40:27,550
It smells terrific.

1642
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:36,920
I smelt it.

1643
01:40:37,660 --> 01:40:39,130
You mean?

1644
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:42,260
I smelt it!

1645
01:40:43,570 --> 01:40:45,090
I can smell again!

1646
01:40:47,770 --> 01:40:49,200
I smelt it!

1647
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:51,810
- I smell you.
- Smell it.

1648
01:40:52,270 --> 01:40:54,040
Oh, you've been driving me wild.

1649
01:40:54,810 --> 01:40:57,110
I smelt it! I smelt it!

1650
01:40:57,310 --> 01:40:59,210
I smelt it, God!

1651
01:40:59,420 --> 01:41:01,850
It's a miracle!

1652
01:41:02,050 --> 01:41:03,920
I smell you, flowers.

1653
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:05,420
I smell you, twig.

1654
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:09,110
I smell horseshit!

1655
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:14,560
It's horrible!

1656
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:17,200
- But I can smell it!
- Smell that shit, baby!

1657
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:19,090
I smelt it.

1658
01:41:24,970 --> 01:41:27,100
Anyway, that's when I learned...

1659
01:41:27,310 --> 01:41:31,010
...that Quaaludes and water-skiing
do not mix.

1660
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:32,680
Now, you remember that.

1661
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:35,280
How come you did all of that stuff,
Grandpa?

1662
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:40,580
Well, Dewey Rahim, I'll tell you.
I was young and stupid then.

1663
01:41:40,790 --> 01:41:42,950
I didn't understand a lot of things.

1664
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:46,320
Think it had to do with how
I was reared as a boy.

1665
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:49,320
But, you know, I got no complaints.

1666
01:41:49,530 --> 01:41:51,690
It's been a beautiful ride.

1667
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:53,430
A beautiful ride?

1668
01:41:56,640 --> 01:41:59,110
A beautiful ride.

1669
01:42:00,140 --> 01:42:04,040
Dewey, sweetheart,
there's someone here to see you.

1670
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:08,150
Mr. Cox.

1671
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:11,610
I'm sorry, have we met?

1672
01:42:12,050 --> 01:42:15,250
You worked with my father,
Kvetch L'Chaim.

1673
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:16,820
You're Mr. L'Chaim's boy?

1674
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:19,490
Dreidel L'Chaim, that's me.

1675
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:22,130
Well, it's nice to see you again,
Dreidel L'Chaim.

1676
01:42:22,330 --> 01:42:23,560
The pleasure's all mine.

1677
01:42:23,770 --> 01:42:27,700
Listen, Mr. Cox,
there's something I want to show you.

1678
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:30,000
I never rock a fella
But I rock a Cinderella

1679
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:33,000
While she's sittin' in between
A nigga's legs like a cello

1680
01:42:33,210 --> 01:42:34,940
Must be those pair of double-Ds

1681
01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:37,510
That got a nigga sittin'
Rock-hard in his jeans

1682
01:42:38,450 --> 01:42:40,540
Time to play
Make your mouth into a hole, yo

1683
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:41,910
Tell me how I feel
When I'm rockin' your boat

1684
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:44,240
- I wanna make you fuckin'
- Hard

1685
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:48,260
I'm so wet, I gotta make you

1686
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:52,150
Hard

1687
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:57,260
Mr. L'Chaim, how could you
allow them to do such a thing...

1688
01:42:57,470 --> 01:42:58,870
...with my husband's music?

1689
01:42:59,070 --> 01:43:00,860
Through the roof, we're selling.

1690
01:43:01,070 --> 01:43:03,700
Lil' Nutzzak. That's the rapper.
Sweet kid.

1691
01:43:03,910 --> 01:43:07,310
Anyway, he's introduced
a whole new generation...

1692
01:43:07,510 --> 01:43:09,480
...to the magic of Dewey Cox.

1693
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:13,170
You could even play together.
Cox and Lil' Nutzzak. What a package.

1694
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,110
Anyway, as if that was not enough...

1695
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:19,050
...they're giving Dewey the Lifetime
Achievement Award next month.

1696
01:43:21,660 --> 01:43:23,890
The Lifetime Achievement Award?

1697
01:43:24,090 --> 01:43:26,790
Baby, that's wonderful.

1698
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,520
You go on TV, they give you the award,
you play a song, it's a magical thing.

1699
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:32,990
I can't go on TV and play.

1700
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:34,570
- What? Why not?
- Why, Grandpa?

1701
01:43:34,770 --> 01:43:39,400
Hell, I'm 71 years old. I don't even
know if I can rock no more.

1702
01:43:39,610 --> 01:43:41,410
Of course you can rock, sweetheart.

1703
01:43:41,610 --> 01:43:43,640
Of course you can rock, sweetheart.

1704
01:43:43,850 --> 01:43:45,900
Well, I don't know that I can rock.

1705
01:43:47,350 --> 01:43:48,840
And besides that...

1706
01:43:51,550 --> 01:43:53,710
...I gave that life up for a reason.

1707
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:57,760
I'm afraid of the temptations,
Darlene.

1708
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:01,190
You can do it, Dewey.
I know you can.

1709
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:04,230
Just go out there
and sing your song.

1710
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:09,900
I'm gonna need my band.

1711
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:22,480
My hip.

1712
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:40,160
Ladies and gentlemen...

1713
01:44:40,370 --> 01:44:44,670
... please welcome Jewel, Lyle Lovett
and Jackson Browne.

1714
01:44:44,870 --> 01:44:46,430
Walk hard

1715
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:49,670
Hard

1716
01:44:50,210 --> 01:44:52,040
Down life's

1717
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,570
- Rocky road
- Rocky road

1718
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:56,610
Walk bold

1719
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:00,190
Hard

1720
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:02,580
That's my creed

1721
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:05,460
- My code
- My code

1722
01:45:05,730 --> 01:45:09,460
I been scorned and slandered
And ridiculed too

1723
01:45:10,430 --> 01:45:14,330
Had to struggle every day
My whole life through

1724
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,910
Seen my share of the worst
This world can give

1725
01:45:19,470 --> 01:45:24,840
But I still got a dream
And a burnin' rage to live

1726
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:27,410
- Hi.
- Hey there.

1727
01:45:27,620 --> 01:45:28,610
Hello.

1728
01:45:28,820 --> 01:45:31,150
Oh, he is so cute.

1729
01:45:31,350 --> 01:45:33,510
What are you doing later, Dewey?

1730
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:39,250
I am returning to the hotel
with my family.

1731
01:45:39,630 --> 01:45:41,560
Good night to you.

1732
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:45,500
He fucked my grandma.

1733
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:47,230
That's awesome.

1734
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:48,460
Ghostface Killah.

1735
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:51,440
Walking hard
I'm a real hard walker

1736
01:45:51,640 --> 01:45:54,170
Fast on the trigger
And a smooth talker

1737
01:45:54,380 --> 01:45:58,710
My guns pop out like a jack-in-the-box
I'll cut you in half like Dewey Cox

1738
01:45:58,910 --> 01:46:00,210
- Walk hard
- My skin stays scarred

1739
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:01,910
You can ask God

1740
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:04,140
Lots of ladies unsnapped they bras

1741
01:46:04,350 --> 01:46:06,820
Ask Lyle Lovett
I had sex on Mars

1742
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:09,420
That's how we do it
When we walk hard

1743
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:12,120
- Walk hard
- How do I walk? Hard as a stone

1744
01:46:12,330 --> 01:46:14,560
How do I walk?
Hard like a bone

1745
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:17,130
- Walk hard
- How do I walk? Like a jackhammer tool

1746
01:46:17,330 --> 01:46:19,770
How do I walk?
Harder than Jewel

1747
01:46:19,970 --> 01:46:24,740
Tell me how we walk
Hard, hard, hard, hard

1748
01:46:24,940 --> 01:46:27,000
Oh, no. You're adorable.

1749
01:46:27,210 --> 01:46:30,110
Sam. What are y'all doing in here?

1750
01:46:30,310 --> 01:46:33,580
Dewey, get out of here.
You don't want no part of this shit.

1751
01:46:34,050 --> 01:46:35,040
What is it?

1752
01:46:35,250 --> 01:46:37,650
It's a medication
for erectile dysfunction.

1753
01:46:37,850 --> 01:46:39,340
It gives you a boner.

1754
01:46:39,550 --> 01:46:41,780
Not to be used if you have
a heart condition.

1755
01:46:41,990 --> 01:46:45,520
If boners last for more than four hours,
call more ladies.

1756
01:46:46,230 --> 01:46:48,250
Well, that does sound tempting.

1757
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:52,260
But do you know what, Sam?
I really don't want no part of that shit.

1758
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:55,300
Did you hear what I said?
It gives you a boner.

1759
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:57,940
Hate to let you down, old friend...

1760
01:46:58,140 --> 01:47:00,670
...but I don't wanna succumb
to the temptations.

1761
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:03,170
- My girl
- My girl

1762
01:47:03,380 --> 01:47:06,680
Talkin' 'bout my girl, yeah

1763
01:47:06,980 --> 01:47:08,240
My girl

1764
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:10,710
The Temptations!

1765
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:14,010
When it's cold outside

1766
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:17,260
I got the month of May

1767
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:30,000
Do I still have what it takes?

1768
01:47:30,710 --> 01:47:33,570
Am I still the man I used to be?

1769
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:37,700
And do I even want to be?

1770
01:47:38,050 --> 01:47:40,210
You're still Dewey Cox.

1771
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:43,580
And you're the only man
who ever will be.

1772
01:47:44,190 --> 01:47:45,680
But is that enough?

1773
01:47:45,890 --> 01:47:47,350
It's more than enough.

1774
01:47:49,790 --> 01:47:54,420
Nate. Have I fulfilled my promise
to be double great for the both of us?

1775
01:47:54,630 --> 01:47:57,720
Are you kidding?
You've made 44 gold records.

1776
01:47:58,130 --> 01:48:00,160
You've been addicted to,
and then kicked...

1777
01:48:00,370 --> 01:48:02,060
...almost every drug known to man.

1778
01:48:02,270 --> 01:48:05,430
You slept with 411 women
and three men.

1779
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:08,580
Dewey, you have had
an awesome life.

1780
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:10,910
I have, haven't I?

1781
01:48:11,110 --> 01:48:12,880
You sure have.

1782
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:17,840
- Pa.
- Son, you learned the hard way.

1783
01:48:18,050 --> 01:48:20,890
You can't spend all your time
thinking about Dewey Cox.

1784
01:48:21,090 --> 01:48:23,720
You gotta think about the world
and your family.

1785
01:48:23,930 --> 01:48:26,190
But then, at the same time...

1786
01:48:26,390 --> 01:48:27,920
Are you my inner child?

1787
01:48:28,130 --> 01:48:31,100
- Yeah, Dewey, I'm you.
- He's us.

1788
01:48:31,330 --> 01:48:34,730
You realized you gotta take care
of Dewey Cox.

1789
01:48:34,940 --> 01:48:38,030
That's a little different
than what I was saying.

1790
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:39,470
You're all right.

1791
01:48:39,670 --> 01:48:44,700
Pa, inner child, Nate,
my own reflection.

1792
01:48:45,310 --> 01:48:48,810
I've learned that I can't spend
all my time thinking about Dewey Cox.

1793
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:51,540
And I've also learned
I need to love Dewey Cox.

1794
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:54,310
I can't spend all my time
thinking about other people.

1795
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:56,220
I have to focus on myself.

1796
01:48:56,420 --> 01:49:01,260
But also not focus on myself
and instead focus on other people.

1797
01:49:01,460 --> 01:49:03,090
It's all so clear now.

1798
01:49:03,830 --> 01:49:06,490
It's not about yourself
and other people.

1799
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:08,970
- Mama.
- It's about the music.

1800
01:49:09,170 --> 01:49:12,440
- It's about the music.
- It always has been.

1801
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:14,970
It always has been.

1802
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:17,340
It always has been.

1803
01:49:17,950 --> 01:49:21,210
- Who are you?
- I'm your feminine side.

1804
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:23,940
I've been waiting for you
to get in touch with me.

1805
01:49:26,620 --> 01:49:28,420
We heard him sing
about walking hard...

1806
01:49:28,620 --> 01:49:31,850
...and we learned a little something
about how we wanted to walk.

1807
01:49:32,430 --> 01:49:35,860
What do we think about
when we think about Cox?

1808
01:49:36,060 --> 01:49:37,860
He's been called the Drifter.

1809
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:42,440
Also the Shape Shifter,
the Master Chef, the Chameleon.

1810
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:45,000
The Problem Child. The Hard One.

1811
01:49:45,210 --> 01:49:48,110
The White Indian. The Giant Midget.

1812
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:51,610
If Elvis and Buddy Holly are
the Cain and Abel of rock 'n' roll...

1813
01:49:51,810 --> 01:49:53,970
...and Bruce Springsteen
is Zechariah...

1814
01:49:54,180 --> 01:49:55,980
...lggy Pop is Methuselah...

1815
01:49:56,180 --> 01:49:59,810
...and, of course, Neil Young
is the wise prophet Ezekiel...

1816
01:50:00,020 --> 01:50:02,790
...then what does
that make Dewey Cox?

1817
01:50:02,990 --> 01:50:04,720
Well, I don't know what God...

1818
01:50:04,930 --> 01:50:06,120
Mr. Cox?

1819
01:50:06,930 --> 01:50:09,450
I don't wanna rush him,
but he goes on in a minute.

1820
01:50:10,970 --> 01:50:15,730
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my great honor to introduce...

1821
01:50:15,940 --> 01:50:19,200
...for the first time on-stage
in 25 years...

1822
01:50:19,410 --> 01:50:22,470
...performing his final masterpiece...

1823
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:25,200
...that will sum up his entire life...

1824
01:50:25,410 --> 01:50:26,970
Mr. Cox?

1825
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,840
...the one, the only...

1826
01:50:29,050 --> 01:50:30,610
I'm ready.

1827
01:50:30,820 --> 01:50:32,750
...Mr. Dewey Cox.

1828
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:50,630
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

1829
01:50:51,110 --> 01:50:52,940
You'll forgive me if I'm a bit rusty.

1830
01:50:53,140 --> 01:50:55,910
This is the first song I've written
in a very long time.

1831
01:50:56,110 --> 01:50:57,170
I hope you enjoy it.

1832
01:50:59,310 --> 01:51:02,080
Now that I have lived

1833
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:05,880
A lifetime's worth of days

1834
01:51:06,450 --> 01:51:08,950
Finally I see

1835
01:51:09,790 --> 01:51:13,520
The folly of my ways

1836
01:51:14,730 --> 01:51:17,390
So listen when I sing of

1837
01:51:17,770 --> 01:51:20,560
The temptations of this world

1838
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:24,290
Fancy cars and needles

1839
01:51:26,070 --> 01:51:29,980
Whiskey, flesh and pearls

1840
01:51:30,350 --> 01:51:33,040
And then in the end

1841
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:36,480
It's family and friends

1842
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:39,410
Loving yourself

1843
01:51:39,790 --> 01:51:42,310
But not only yourself

1844
01:51:42,690 --> 01:51:46,290
It's about the good walk
And the hard walk

1845
01:51:46,490 --> 01:51:50,450
And the young girls you've made cry

1846
01:51:50,670 --> 01:51:55,230
It's about make a little music
Every day till you die

1847
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,500
It's a beautiful ride

1848
01:51:58,710 --> 01:52:02,510
Beautiful ride

1849
01:52:02,710 --> 01:52:04,300
A beautiful ride

1850
01:52:04,510 --> 01:52:08,640
Beautiful ride

1851
01:52:10,690 --> 01:52:13,780
Beautiful

1852
01:52:13,990 --> 01:52:18,860
Beautiful ride

1853
01:52:19,630 --> 01:52:22,530
As I stand on the precipice of death

1854
01:52:22,930 --> 01:52:25,560
My perspective is enormous

1855
01:52:26,230 --> 01:52:28,790
Every leaf, every cloud

1856
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:32,370
I see the hands
Which have formed us

1857
01:52:32,770 --> 01:52:35,040
And some days all you got

1858
01:52:35,780 --> 01:52:38,440
Is a nighttime graveyard walk

1859
01:52:38,850 --> 01:52:41,840
And you whistle some sweet melody

1860
01:52:42,050 --> 01:52:46,150
To the ghosts down at the dock

1861
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:49,090
Sing into your hand

1862
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:52,980
Lead the marching band

1863
01:52:53,630 --> 01:52:58,120
Don't you let 'em fade
Your colors gray

1864
01:52:59,770 --> 01:53:02,400
'Cause when all is said and done

1865
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:05,460
When youth is spent and burned

1866
01:53:06,340 --> 01:53:09,070
You'll see that it's all about

1867
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:10,400
Music

1868
01:53:10,810 --> 01:53:11,970
Flowers

1869
01:53:12,510 --> 01:53:13,500
Babies

1870
01:53:14,150 --> 01:53:15,780
Sharin' the good times

1871
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:18,010
Travelin' not just for business

1872
01:53:18,220 --> 01:53:20,650
Accepting your mortality

1873
01:53:20,860 --> 01:53:26,090
This is finally what I've learned

1874
01:53:26,590 --> 01:53:29,500
And then in the end

1875
01:53:29,700 --> 01:53:32,630
It's family and friends

1876
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:35,530
Loving yourself

1877
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:38,670
But not only yourself

1878
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:42,210
It's about the good walk
And the hard walk

1879
01:53:42,580 --> 01:53:46,670
And the young girls you've made cry

1880
01:53:46,950 --> 01:53:52,350
It's about make a little music
Every day till you die

1881
01:53:52,550 --> 01:53:54,020
It's a beautiful ride

1882
01:53:54,220 --> 01:53:59,250
Beautiful ride

1883
01:54:00,460 --> 01:54:06,200
Beautiful ride

1884
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:09,670
Beautiful

1885
01:54:10,070 --> 01:54:13,100
Beautiful ride

1886
01:54:13,310 --> 01:54:17,900
Beautiful ride

1887
01:54:19,650 --> 01:54:24,950
Beautiful ride

1888
01:54:25,950 --> 01:54:28,720
Beautiful

1889
01:54:29,190 --> 01:54:36,290
Beautiful ride

1890
01:59:35,330 --> 01:59:36,820
Walk hard

1891
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:40,290
Hard

1892
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:43,130
Down life's

1893
01:59:44,310 --> 01:59:46,210
Rocky road

1894
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:49,400
Walk bold

1895
01:59:51,210 --> 01:59:52,200
Hard

1896
01:59:53,650 --> 01:59:55,380
That's my creed

1897
01:59:57,190 --> 01:59:59,980
My code

1898
02:00:00,190 --> 02:00:01,710
Walk hard

1899
02:00:03,320 --> 02:00:04,480
Walk hard

1900
02:00:06,530 --> 02:00:08,830
Walk hard

1901
02:00:10,030 --> 02:00:16,960
Walk hard

1223
02:00:17,700 --> 02:00:44,700
