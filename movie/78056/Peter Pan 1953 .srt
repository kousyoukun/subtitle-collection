9
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:21,436
TWINKLE, TWINKLE LITTLE STAR

00:01:21,812 --> 00:01:24,857

11
00:01:26,024 --> 00:01:28,902

00:01:41,748 --> 00:01:46,170
EACH TIME WE SAY GOOD NIGHT

15
00:01:47,504 --> 00:01:52,968
WE'LL THANKTHE LITTLE STAR THAT SHINES

16
00:01:54,344 --> 00:02:01,685
THE SECOND FROM THE RIGHT

17
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,567
ALL THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE,

18
00:02:08,942 --> 00:02:12,154
AND IT WILL ALL HAPPEN AGAIN.

19
00:02:12,362 --> 00:02:14,740
BUT THIS TIME, IT HAPPENED IN LONDON.

20
00:02:18,035 --> 00:02:20,537
IT HAPPENED ON A QUIET STREET IN
BLOOMSBURY.

21
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:24,041
THAT CORNER HOUSE OVER THERE...

22
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,543
IS THE HOME OF THE DARLING FAMILY.

23
00:02:27,377 --> 00:02:29,588
AND PETER PAN CHOSE THIS PARTICULAR
HOUSE...

24
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:32,716
BECAUSE THERE WERE PEOPLE HERE WHO
BELIEVED IN HIM.

25
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:35,052
THERE WAS MRS. DARLING.

26
00:02:37,387 --> 00:02:39,014
GEORGE, DEAR, DO HURRY.

27
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:41,141
WE MUSTN'T BE LATE FOR THE PARTYYOU KNOW.

28
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:43,185
MRS. DARLING BELIEVED THAT PETER PAN...

29
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,813
WAS THE SPIRIT OF YOUTH, BUT MR. DARLING

30
00:02:47,272 --> 00:02:50,150
MARY, UNLESS I FIND MY CUFF LINKS,

31
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:51,527
WE DON'T GO TO THE PARTY.

32
00:02:52,194 --> 00:02:53,445
AND IF WE DON'T GO TO THE PARTY.

33
00:02:53,737 --> 00:02:55,531
I CAN NEVER SHOW MY FACE IN THE OFFICE
AGAIN.

34
00:02:56,323 --> 00:02:57,574
AND IF I... OUCH!

35
00:02:58,242 --> 00:03:01,203
WELL, MR. DARLING WAS A PRACTICAL MAN.

36
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:04,915
THE BOYS, HOWEVER, JOHN AND MICHAEL,

37
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,793
BELIEVED PETER PAN WAS A REAL PERSON,

38
00:03:08,544 --> 00:03:11,296
AND MADE HIM THE HERO OF ALL THEIR NURSERY
GAMES.

39
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:13,549
BLAST YOU, PETER PAN.

40
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:18,762
GIVE UP, CAPTAIN HOOK?

41
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:22,474
GIVE UP? I'LL TEACH YOU TO CUT OFF ME
HAND!

42
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:24,142
OH, NO, JOHN.

43
00:03:24,434 --> 00:03:25,561
IT WAS THE LEFT HAND.

44
00:03:26,478 --> 00:03:27,938
OH, YES. THANKYOU, WENDY.

45
00:03:28,564 --> 00:03:31,525
WENDY, THE ELDEST, NOT ONLY BELIEVED,

46
00:03:32,693 --> 00:03:34,736
BUT SHE WAS THE SUPREME AUTHORITY ON PETER
PAN...

47
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:37,072
AND ALL HIS MARVELOUS ADVENTURES.

48
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:38,282
OH, NANA,

49
00:03:38,657 --> 00:03:40,617
MUST WE ALWAYS TAKE THAT NASTYTONIC?

50
00:03:41,326 --> 00:03:43,662
NANA, THE NURSEMAID, BEING A DOG,

51
00:03:44,246 --> 00:03:46,248
KEPT HER OPINIONS TO HERSELF,

52
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:50,586
AND VIEWED THE WHOLE AFFAIR WITH A CERTAIN
TOLERANCE.

53
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,510
TAKE THAT!

54
00:03:59,928 --> 00:04:01,847
I'LL SLASH YOU TO RIBBONS!

55
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:04,057
I'LL CUT YOU TO PIECES!

56
00:04:05,642 --> 00:04:07,853
- AHA! - OUCH!

57
00:04:08,312 --> 00:04:09,605
CAREFUL, MICHAEL, MY GLASSES.

58
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,148
I'M SORRY, JOHN.

59
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,903
YOU'LL NEVER LEAVE THIS SHIP ALIVE! OH,
YES, I WILL.

60
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:17,988
TAKE THAT!

61
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:25,621
SCUTTLE ME BONES BOY!

62
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:27,372
I'LL SLIT YOUR GIZZARD.

63
00:04:28,582 --> 00:04:30,792
NO, YOU WON'T. BACK! BACK!

64
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:32,878
BACK, VILLAIN!

65
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,671
INSOLENT PUP!

66
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:36,798
WICKED PIRATE!

67
00:04:37,716 --> 00:04:38,759
I GOT YOU!

68
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:41,178
YOU DIDN'T EITHER. YOU NEVER TOUCHED ME.

69
00:04:41,553 --> 00:04:43,722
TAKE THAT, AND THAT!

70
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:45,599
OOH.,

71
00:04:46,308 --> 00:04:47,768
BOYS, LESS NOISE, PLEASE.

72
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:53,982
HELLO, FATHER. YOU OLD BILGE RAT!

73
00:04:54,274 --> 00:04:56,401
WHAT? NOW SEE HERE, MICHAEL.

74
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,905
NOT YOU, FATHER. HE'S PETER PAN.

75
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:02,074
AND JOHN'S CAPTAIN HOOK.

76
00:05:02,366 --> 00:05:04,868
YES, OF COURSE. HAVE YOU SEEN MY...

77
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:08,372
NANA, FOR GOODNESS SAKE!

78
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:11,333
WHERE ARE THOSE CUFF LINKS?

79
00:05:12,584 --> 00:05:13,377
CUFF LINKS?

80
00:05:13,794 --> 00:05:16,213
YES, THE GOLD ONES.

81
00:05:17,714 --> 00:05:19,716
THE BURIED TREASURE, WHERE IS IT?

82
00:05:20,008 --> 00:05:21,885
I DON'T KNOW. THE MAP.

83
00:05:22,553 --> 00:05:24,555
- WHERE'S THE TREASURE MAP? - IT GOT
LOST.

84
00:05:26,056 --> 00:05:27,099
MY SHIRT FRONT!

85
00:05:27,474 --> 00:05:28,892
YOU FOUND IT!

86
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,937
YES, SO I HAVE, AND HEREAFTER...

87
00:05:32,563 --> 00:05:34,189
DON'T PAW ME, MICHAEL.

88
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:35,649
THIS IS MY LAST CLEAN...

89
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,695
NO-O-O!

90
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:42,030
GEORGE, DEAR, WE REALLY MUST HURRY.

91
00:05:42,406 --> 00:05:44,366
MARY, LOOK!

92
00:05:45,576 --> 00:05:46,159
GEORGE!

93
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,911
IT'S CHALK.

94
00:05:48,203 --> 00:05:50,706
WHY, MICHAEL. IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.

95
00:05:51,456 --> 00:05:52,541
IT'S IN THE STORY.

96
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,711
WENDY SAYS... WENDY? STORY?

97
00:05:56,587 --> 00:05:57,588
I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN.

98
00:05:58,589 --> 00:05:59,590
WENDY!

99
00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:03,302
WENDY! YES, FATHER?

100
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:06,430
WOULD YOU KINDLY... OH, MOTHER!

101
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:09,892
- YOU LOOK LOVELY. - THANKYOU, DEAR.

102
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:10,601
WENDY.

103
00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:12,686
JUST MY OLD GOWN MADE OVER...

104
00:06:13,896 --> 00:06:15,397
MARY, IF YOU DON'T MIND...

105
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:17,399
WHY, FATHER,

106
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:19,568
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO YOUR SHIRT?

107
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,737
WHAT HAVE I...?

108
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:23,822
OOHHH!

109
00:06:24,448 --> 00:06:27,075
NOW GEORGE, REALLY IT COMES RIGHT OFF.

110
00:06:27,284 --> 00:06:29,244
THAT'S NO EXCUSE. WENDY,

111
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,829
HAVEN'T I WARNED YOU?

112
00:06:31,455 --> 00:06:33,790
STUFFING THE BOYS WITH SILLY STORIES...

113
00:06:33,957 --> 00:06:35,042
BUT THEYAREN'T!

114
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,961
I SAYTHEYARE. CAPTAIN CROOK,

115
00:06:38,337 --> 00:06:40,464
PETER PIRATE! PETER PAN, FATHER.

116
00:06:40,964 --> 00:06:44,051
PAN, PIRATE, POPPYCOCK!

117
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:45,719
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

118
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:48,138
ABSOLUTE POPPYCOCK!

119
00:06:48,514 --> 00:06:50,974
AND LET ME TELL YOU, THIS RIDICULOUS...

120
00:06:51,225 --> 00:06:53,936
NOW, GEORGE... "NOW, GEORGE"?

121
00:06:54,853 --> 00:06:56,480
"NOW, GEORGE"?

122
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,399
WELL, NOW, GEORGE WILL HAVE HIS SAY!

123
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:00,442
PLEASE, DEAR.

124
00:07:00,984 --> 00:07:02,903
THE CHILD'S GROWING UP.

125
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:05,989
IT'S HIGH TIME SHE HAD A ROOM OF HER OWN.

126
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,616
- FATHER! - GEORGE!

127
00:07:08,158 --> 00:07:09,326
- WHAT? - NO!

128
00:07:10,661 --> 00:07:12,704
I MEAN IT. YOUNG LADY,

129
00:07:13,664 --> 00:07:15,958
THIS IS YOUR LAST NIGHT IN THE NURSERY,

130
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,085
AND THAT'S MY LAST WORD... YELP!

131
00:07:18,961 --> 00:07:21,964
UH, AH, OH!

132
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:23,507
OOOOH!

133
00:07:23,882 --> 00:07:24,591
OOH, OW!

134
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:33,809
NO!

135
00:07:36,311 --> 00:07:37,688
NO-O-O!

136
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:47,322
OHHHH.

137
00:07:51,493 --> 00:07:53,245
POOR NANA.

138
00:07:53,954 --> 00:07:55,497
"POOR NANA"?

139
00:07:56,582 --> 00:07:57,958
THIS IS THE LAST STRAW!

140
00:07:58,876 --> 00:08:01,044
OUT! OUT, I SAY!

141
00:08:01,503 --> 00:08:03,046
NO, FATHER, NO.

142
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:05,716
THERE'LL BE NO MORE DOGS FOR NURSEMAIDS...

143
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:07,634
IN THIS HOUSE!

144
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:10,512
GOODBYE, NANA.

145
00:08:12,556 --> 00:08:13,432
"POOR NANA."

146
00:08:13,974 --> 00:08:15,934
OH, YES. "POOR NANA."

147
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:19,021
BUT "POOR FATHER"? OH, NO.

148
00:08:20,856 --> 00:08:22,733
BLAST IT! WHERE IS THAT ROPE?

149
00:08:24,735 --> 00:08:25,944
OH, THANKYOU.

150
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:34,077
DON'T LOOKAT ME LIKE THAT.

151
00:08:34,244 --> 00:08:35,537
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.

152
00:08:35,787 --> 00:08:37,289
IT'S JUST THAT...

153
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:40,167
YOU'RE NOT REALLYA NURSE AT ALL.

154
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:42,669
YOU'RE, WELL, A DOG.

155
00:08:43,545 --> 00:08:45,047
AND THE CHILDREN AREN'T PUPPIES,

156
00:08:45,297 --> 00:08:46,256
THEY'RE PEOPLE.

157
00:08:46,924 --> 00:08:47,674
AND SOONER OR LATER,

158
00:08:47,925 --> 00:08:49,885
PEOPLE HAVE TO GROW UP.

159
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:53,555
BUT MOTHER, I DON'T WANT TO GROW UP.

160
00:08:54,223 --> 00:08:54,932
NOW DEAR,

161
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:57,893
DON'T WORRYABOUT IT ANYMORE TONIGHT.

162
00:08:58,352 --> 00:09:01,772
HE CALLED PETER PAN "ABSOLUTE POPPYCOCK."

163
00:09:02,481 --> 00:09:03,857
I'M SURE HE DIDN'T MEAN IT, JOHN.

164
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:06,318
FATHER WAS JUST UPSET.

165
00:09:07,152 --> 00:09:08,237
POOR NANA,

166
00:09:09,905 --> 00:09:11,615
OUT THERE ALL ALONE.

167
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,075
NO MORE TEARS, MICHAEL.

168
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:15,911
IT'S A WARM NIGHT. SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

169
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:18,121
MOTHER.

170
00:09:19,122 --> 00:09:19,832
WHAT, DEAR?

171
00:09:20,707 --> 00:09:22,084
THE BURIED TREASURE.

172
00:09:22,793 --> 00:09:23,544
NOW CHILDREN,

173
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:26,088
DON'T JUDGE YOUR FATHER TOO HARSHLY.

174
00:09:26,797 --> 00:09:27,256
AFTER ALL,

175
00:09:28,131 --> 00:09:29,925
HE REALLY LOVES YOU VERY MUCH.

176
00:09:31,218 --> 00:09:33,720
DON'T LOCK IT MOTHER. HE MIGHT COME BACK.

177
00:09:34,137 --> 00:09:35,013
HE?

178
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:37,057
YES, PETER PAN.

179
00:09:37,724 --> 00:09:41,603
YOU SEE, I FOUND SOMETHING THAT BELONGS TO
HIM.

180
00:09:42,896 --> 00:09:45,607
- AND WHAT'S THAT? - HIS SHADOW.

181
00:09:46,108 --> 00:09:46,859
SHADOW?

182
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:48,443
NANA HAD IT,

183
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:51,780
BUT I TOOK IT AWAY.

184
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:54,741
OH?

185
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:58,120
YES, OF COURSE.

186
00:09:59,037 --> 00:10:00,372
GOOD NIGHT, DEAR.

187
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,171
GEORGE DO YOU THINKTHE CHILDREN WILL BE
SAFE WITHOUT NANA?

188
00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:09,548
SAFE OF COURSE SAFE. WHY NOT?

189
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:12,843
WELL, WENDY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT A SHADOW.

190
00:10:13,343 --> 00:10:15,846
SHADOW? WHOSE SHADOW? PETER PAN'S.

191
00:10:16,346 --> 00:10:19,308
OH, PETER PAN'S. PETER PAN'S!

192
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,143
YOU DON'T SAY.

193
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,563
GOODNESS GRACIOUS, WHATEVER SHALL WE DO?

194
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:26,106
SOUND THE ALARM!

195
00:10:26,857 --> 00:10:29,651
CALL SCOTLAND YARD! THERE MUST HAVE BEEN
SOMEONE.

196
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,280
MARY, OF ALL THE IMPOSSIBLE CHILDISH
FIDDLE-FADDLE!

197
00:10:33,572 --> 00:10:34,781
PETER PAN, INDEED!

198
00:10:35,032 --> 00:10:38,035
HOW CAN WE EXPECT THE CHILDREN TO GROW UP
AND BE PRACTICAL...

199
00:10:38,368 --> 00:10:39,828
WHEN YOU'RE AS BAD AS THEYARE?

200
00:10:40,454 --> 00:10:42,372
NO WONDER WENDY GETS THESE IDIOTIC IDEAS.

201
00:11:14,404 --> 00:11:15,697
OVER THERE, TINK,

202
00:11:15,948 --> 00:11:16,823
IN ITS DEN.

203
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:18,450
IS IT THERE?

204
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:23,205
MUST BE HERE SOMEWHERE.

205
00:11:28,544 --> 00:11:30,337
TINK!

206
00:11:30,462 --> 00:11:31,505
SHHH!

207
00:11:32,422 --> 00:11:33,382
STOP PLAYING.

208
00:11:33,507 --> 00:11:35,092
HELP ME FIND MY SHADOW.

209
00:11:36,718 --> 00:11:37,511
SHADOW,

210
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:39,763
OH, SHADOW.

211
00:12:04,955 --> 00:12:05,956
TING-A-LING.

212
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:07,166
HUH?

213
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,376
TING-A-LING.

214
00:12:27,477 --> 00:12:28,270
AHA!

215
00:12:38,488 --> 00:12:39,406
PETER PAN!

216
00:12:41,783 --> 00:12:44,161
I KNEWYOU'D COME BACK.

217
00:12:44,411 --> 00:12:45,787
I SAVED YOUR SHADOW FOR YOU.

218
00:12:46,246 --> 00:12:47,706
I DO HOPE IT ISN'T RUMPLED.

219
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:50,876
YOU LOOK EXACTLYTHE WAY I THOUGHT YOU
WOULD.

220
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:52,586
TALLER, PERHAPS...

221
00:12:53,712 --> 00:12:56,131
YOU CAN'T STICK IT ON WITH SOAP.

222
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:57,925
IT NEEDS SEWING.

223
00:12:58,342 --> 00:12:59,426
THAT'S THE PROPER WAYTO DO IT.

224
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:02,012
I'VE NEVER SEWN SHADOWS BEFORE.

225
00:13:02,846 --> 00:13:03,889
SORRY SHADOW I MEAN.

226
00:13:04,014 --> 00:13:04,348
OF COURSE,

227
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,974
I KNEW IT WAS YOURS.

228
00:13:06,183 --> 00:13:07,476
I SAID TO MYSELF,

229
00:13:08,143 --> 00:13:09,561
"PUT IT AWAY FOR HIM UNTIL HE COMES BACK."

230
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,355
OH, SURE COME BACK.

231
00:13:11,522 --> 00:13:13,565
AND YOU DID, DIDN'T YOU, PETER?

232
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,527
ONE CAN'T LEAVE HIS SHADOW LYING ABOUT...

233
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,070
AND NOT MISS IT, SOONER OR LATER.

234
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:19,530
DON'T YOU AGREE?

235
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,323
WHAT I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND...

236
00:13:21,657 --> 00:13:22,491
IS HOW NANA GOT IT.

237
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:25,994
SIT DOWN. IT WON'T TAKE LONG.

238
00:13:26,537 --> 00:13:27,496
SHE ISN'T VICIOUS.

239
00:13:28,247 --> 00:13:29,373
SHE'S A WONDERFUL NURSE...

240
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,376
GIRLS TALKTOO MUCH.

241
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:33,836
YES, GIRLS TALK...

242
00:13:34,461 --> 00:13:35,879
HMM? OH.

243
00:13:36,338 --> 00:13:37,923
GET ON WITH IT, GIRL.

244
00:13:38,423 --> 00:13:40,592
MY NAME IS WENDY, WENDY MORIA, AND...

245
00:13:40,926 --> 00:13:43,011
WENDY'S ENOUGH. OH.

246
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:45,931
HOW DID NANA GET YOUR SHADOW, PETER?

247
00:13:46,557 --> 00:13:49,351
SHE JUMPED AT ME AT THE WINDOW.

248
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:50,561
WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE?

249
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:52,104
I CAME TO LISTEN TO THE STORIES.

250
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:56,066
BUT MY STORIES ARE ALL ABOUT YOU.

251
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:56,942
OF COURSE

252
00:13:57,359 --> 00:13:58,277
THAT'S WAY I LIKE THEM.

253
00:13:58,861 --> 00:14:00,696
I TELL 'EM TO THE LOST BOYS.

254
00:14:00,904 --> 00:14:03,323
THE LOST... I REMEMBER.

255
00:14:03,907 --> 00:14:04,867
THEY'RE YOUR MEN.

256
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:07,661
I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME BACKTONIGHT.

257
00:14:08,245 --> 00:14:10,122
I MIGHT NEVER HAVE SEEN YOU. WHY

258
00:14:10,622 --> 00:14:12,916
BECAUSE I HAVE TO GROW UP TOMORROW. GROW
UP?

259
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,252
TONIGHT'S MY LAST NIGHT IN THE NURSERY.

260
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:18,255
BUT THAT MEANS NO MORE STORIES.

261
00:14:18,714 --> 00:14:20,799
MM-HMM. NO!

262
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:23,051
I WON'T HAVE IT. COME ON!

263
00:14:23,969 --> 00:14:25,220
BUT WHERE ARE WE GOING?

264
00:14:25,762 --> 00:14:26,430
TO NEVERLAND.

265
00:14:28,724 --> 00:14:29,641
NEVERLAND!

266
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,268
YOU'LL NEVER GROW UP THERE.

267
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:32,686
OH, PETER,

268
00:14:33,812 --> 00:14:35,439
IT WILL BE SO WONDERFUL!

269
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,107
BUT WAIT!

270
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:39,234
WHAT WOULD MOTHER SAY?

271
00:14:39,776 --> 00:14:42,571
MOTHER? WHAT'S "MOTHER"? WHY, PETER,

272
00:14:43,405 --> 00:14:45,824
A MOTHER'S SOMEONE WHO LOVES YOU...

273
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:48,118
AND TELLS YOU STORIES...

274
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:48,952
GOOD!

275
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:50,287
YOU CAN BE OUR MOTHER.

276
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:51,914
JUST A MINUTE.

277
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:54,124
I HAVE TO PACK,

278
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,834
AND I MUST LEAVE A NOTE.

279
00:14:56,126 --> 00:14:57,628
I COULDN'T STAYTOO LONG...

280
00:14:58,128 --> 00:15:01,089
OH, NEVERLAND.

281
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:03,509
I'M SO HAPPY,

282
00:15:04,176 --> 00:15:05,928
I THINK I'LL GIVE YOU A KISS.

283
00:15:10,057 --> 00:15:11,975
WHAT'S A "KISS"?

284
00:15:12,643 --> 00:15:13,477
WELL,

285
00:15:14,311 --> 00:15:17,231
I'LL SHOWYOU. OUCH!

286
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:18,565
STOP IT, TINK!

287
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:26,156
JOHN! JOHN, HE'S HERE!

288
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,282
HUH?

289
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:30,452
JIMINY!

290
00:15:31,286 --> 00:15:32,496
WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS THAT?

291
00:15:32,663 --> 00:15:36,083
TINKERBELL. I DON'T KNOWWHAT GOT INTO
HER. HELLO, PETER PAN.

292
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,459
I'M MICHAEL.

293
00:15:37,835 --> 00:15:38,794
MY NAME IS JOHN.

294
00:15:39,294 --> 00:15:42,047
HOW DO YOU DO? OH, LOOK!

295
00:15:42,548 --> 00:15:43,340
A FIREFLY!

296
00:15:43,757 --> 00:15:44,633
A PIXIE!

297
00:15:44,758 --> 00:15:45,467
AMAZING.

298
00:15:46,301 --> 00:15:47,302
TING-A-LING.

299
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:51,056
WHAT'S SHE DOING? TALKING.

300
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:52,307
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

301
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,560
SHE SAYS YOU'RE A BIG UGLY GIRL!

302
00:15:55,018 --> 00:15:56,812
HA, HA, HA. OH.

303
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:59,439
WELL, I THINK SHE'S LOVELY.

304
00:16:00,023 --> 00:16:01,942
TING-A-LING.

305
00:16:02,317 --> 00:16:03,443
COME ON WENDY, LET'S GO.

306
00:16:03,944 --> 00:16:05,779
WHERE ARE WE GOING? TO NEVERLAND.

307
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:06,989
NEVERLAND?

308
00:16:07,447 --> 00:16:08,699
PETER'S TAKING US. US?

309
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:12,369
OF COURSE, I COULDN'T GO WITHOUT MICHAEL
AND JOHN.

310
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,997
I SHOULD LIKE TO CROSS SWORDS...

311
00:16:15,247 --> 00:16:16,707
WITH SOME REAL BUCCANEERS.

312
00:16:17,082 --> 00:16:19,001
AND FIGHT PIRATES, TOO.

313
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:23,922
WELL, ALL RIGHT, BUT YOU GOTTA TAKE
ORDERS.

314
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:25,174
AYE, AYE, SIR.

315
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:26,175
ME, TOO.

316
00:16:27,092 --> 00:16:29,178
BUT PETER, HOW DO WE GET TO NEVERLAND?

317
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:30,512
FLY, OF COURSE.

318
00:16:30,971 --> 00:16:31,513
FLY?

319
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:32,973
IT'S EASY.

320
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,725
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TO...

321
00:16:35,392 --> 00:16:37,853
IS TO...

322
00:16:39,897 --> 00:16:41,273
HA, THAT'S FUNNY.

323
00:16:41,773 --> 00:16:42,316
WHAT'S MATTER?

324
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:43,525
DON'T YOU KNOW?

325
00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:44,693
OH, SURE.

326
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:47,362
IT'S JUST THAT I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT
BEFORE.

327
00:16:48,363 --> 00:16:49,239
SAYTHAT'S IT!

328
00:16:49,698 --> 00:16:51,283
YOU THINK OF A WONDERFUL THOUGHT.

329
00:16:52,117 --> 00:16:53,660
ANY HAPPY LITTLE THOUGHT?

330
00:16:53,911 --> 00:16:54,828
UH-HUH.

331
00:16:55,287 --> 00:16:57,789
- LIKE TOYS AT CHRISTMAS? - SLEIGH BELLS,
SNOW?

332
00:16:58,248 --> 00:16:58,874
YEP.

333
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,709
WATCH ME, NOW. HERE I GO!

334
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,545
IT'S EASIER THAN PIE.

335
00:17:04,922 --> 00:17:06,381
- HE CAN FLY! - HE CAN FLY!

336
00:17:07,257 --> 00:17:08,425
HE FLEWED!

337
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,261
NOW, YOU TRY.

338
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:13,722
I'LL THINK OF A MERMAID LAGOON...

339
00:17:14,932 --> 00:17:17,267
UNDERNEATH A MAGIC MOON.

340
00:17:17,976 --> 00:17:19,895
I'LL THINK I'M IN A PIRATE'S CAVE.

341
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,064
I'LL BE AN INJUN BRAVE.

342
00:17:22,814 --> 00:17:23,899
NOW, EVERYBODYTRY.

343
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:27,069
ONE, TWO, THREE!

344
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:29,488
WE CAN FLY, WE CAN FLY!

345
00:17:29,863 --> 00:17:31,532
WE CAN FLY-Y-Y-Y!

346
00:17:33,283 --> 00:17:36,370
TING-A-LING!

347
00:17:38,956 --> 00:17:39,748
THIS WON'T DO.

348
00:17:40,332 --> 00:17:41,458
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

349
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,127
ALL IT TAKES IS FAITH AND TRUST.

350
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:45,587
OH,

351
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:48,966
DUST!

352
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:49,925
DUST?

353
00:17:50,092 --> 00:17:50,676
YEP!

354
00:17:52,803 --> 00:17:56,223
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF PIXIE DUST.

355
00:18:02,104 --> 00:18:04,773
NOW, THINK OF THE HAPPIEST THINGS.

356
00:18:05,732 --> 00:18:07,067
IT'S THE SAME AS HAVING WINGS.

357
00:18:07,776 --> 00:18:09,361
LET'S TRY IT ONCE MORE.

358
00:18:09,695 --> 00:18:11,154
LOOK, WE'RE RISING OFF THE FLOOR!

359
00:18:11,738 --> 00:18:12,447
JIMINY!

360
00:18:12,948 --> 00:18:15,117
OH, MY. WE CAN FLY!

361
00:18:15,492 --> 00:18:15,951
YOU CAN FLY!

362
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:17,119
WE CAN FLY!

363
00:18:19,788 --> 00:18:20,205
COME ON!

364
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:22,207
HERE WE GO-O-O!

365
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:25,752
OFF TO NEVERLAND!

366
00:18:32,134 --> 00:18:34,094
THINK OF A WONDERFUL THOUGHT

367
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,055
ANY MERRY LITTLE THOUGHT

368
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:39,600
THINK OF CHRISTMAS, THINK OF SNOW

369
00:18:40,142 --> 00:18:41,602
THINK OF SLEIGH BELLS, OFF YOU GO

370
00:18:41,894 --> 00:18:43,270
LIKE REINDEER IN THE SKY

371
00:18:43,395 --> 00:18:45,105
ARF, ARF!

372
00:18:45,981 --> 00:18:46,773
YOU CAN FLYYOU CAN FLY

373
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:47,983
YOU CAN FLY

374
00:18:49,735 --> 00:18:51,820
THINK OF THE HAPPIEST THINGS

375
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:54,531
IT'S THE SAME AS HAVING WINGS

376
00:18:54,948 --> 00:18:57,201
THINKA PATH THAT MOONBEAMS MAKE

377
00:18:57,618 --> 00:18:59,161
IF THE MOON IS STILL AWAKE

378
00:18:59,495 --> 00:19:00,954
YOU'LL SEE HIM WINK HIS EYE

379
00:19:01,872 --> 00:19:04,500
YOU CAN FLY, YOU CAN FLY

380
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,668
ARF, ARF! YOU CAN FLY

381
00:19:08,754 --> 00:19:10,214
UP YOU GO WITH A HEIGH AND HO

382
00:19:10,464 --> 00:19:11,924
TO THE STARS BEYOND THE MOON

383
00:19:12,508 --> 00:19:15,594
THERE'S A NEVERLAND WAITING FOR YOU

384
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:20,140
WHERE ALL YOUR HAPPY DREAMS COME TRUE

385
00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:23,685
EVERY DREAM THAT YOU DREAM

386
00:19:24,228 --> 00:19:26,355
WILL COME TRUE

387
00:19:27,189 --> 00:19:28,482
COME ON, NANA!

388
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:31,610
WHEN THERE'S A SMILE IN YOUR HEART

389
00:19:32,986 --> 00:19:36,073
THERE'S NO BETTER TIME TO START

390
00:19:38,408 --> 00:19:40,410
THINK OF ALL THE JOYYOU'LL FIND

391
00:19:40,702 --> 00:19:42,246
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE WORLD BEHIND

392
00:19:42,454 --> 00:19:43,872
AND BID YOUR CARES GOODBYE

393
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,125
YOU CAN FLY, YOU CAN FLY

394
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:48,252
YOU CAN FLY

395
00:19:48,418 --> 00:19:49,878
YOU CAN FLY

396
00:19:57,636 --> 00:20:02,057
THERE IT IS!

397
00:20:02,724 --> 00:20:03,684
SECOND STAR TO THE RIGHT...

398
00:20:03,934 --> 00:20:04,852
AND STRAIGHT ON 'TIL MORNING.

399
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:09,857
WHEN THERE'S A SMILE IN YOUR HEART

400
00:20:10,774 --> 00:20:13,902
THERE'S NO BETTER TIME TO START

401
00:20:16,113 --> 00:20:18,949
THINK OF ALL THE JOYYOU'LL FIND

402
00:20:19,449 --> 00:20:20,951
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE WORLD BEHIND

403
00:20:21,451 --> 00:20:22,953
AND BID YOUR CARES GOODBYE

404
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:26,165
YOU CAN FLY, YOU CAN FLY

405
00:20:26,498 --> 00:20:27,958
YOU CAN FLY, YOU CAN FLY

406
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:31,128
YOU CAN FLY, YOU CAN FLY

407
00:20:47,102 --> 00:20:50,772
OH, A PIRATE'S LIFE IS A WONDERFUL LIFE

408
00:20:51,064 --> 00:20:52,566
A ROVIN' OVER THE SEA

409
00:20:52,691 --> 00:20:54,610
GIVE ME A CAREER AS A BUCCANEER

410
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:56,820
IT'S THE LIFE OF A PIRATE FOR ME

411
00:20:57,404 --> 00:21:00,032
OH, THE LIFE OF A PIRATE FOR ME

412
00:21:02,451 --> 00:21:05,829
OH, A PIRATE'S LIFE IS A WONDERFUL LIFE

413
00:21:06,288 --> 00:21:07,789
THEY NEVER BURYYOUR BONES

414
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:09,917
FOR WHEN IT'S ALL OVER A JOLLY SEA ROVER

415
00:21:10,209 --> 00:21:11,752
DROPS IN ON HIS FRIEND, DAVY JONES

416
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:15,297
OH, MY GOOD FRIEND, DAVY JONES

417
00:21:16,006 --> 00:21:17,674
GOOD MORNING, SHIPMATES!

418
00:21:18,383 --> 00:21:20,761
WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT IT, MR. SMEE?

419
00:21:21,803 --> 00:21:22,804
HERE WE ARE,

420
00:21:23,138 --> 00:21:25,599
COLLECTING BARNACLES ON THIS MISERABLE
ISLAND.

421
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,102
WHILE HIS NIBS PLAYS
RING-AROUND-THE-ROSY...

422
00:21:29,353 --> 00:21:30,521
WITH PETER PAN.

423
00:21:31,813 --> 00:21:33,607
WE OUGHT TO BE ATTENDING TO THE
BUSINESS...

424
00:21:33,732 --> 00:21:34,858
OF LOOTING SHIPS.

425
00:21:35,901 --> 00:21:36,985
I'VE ALMOST FORGOTTEN...

426
00:21:37,402 --> 00:21:38,820
HOWTO SLIT A THROAT.

427
00:21:39,738 --> 00:21:42,658
BETTER HOP IT, AND TELL THE CAPTAIN...

428
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,576
WE WANTS TO PUT TO SEA!

429
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,953
SEE?

430
00:21:54,628 --> 00:21:56,797
BLAST THAT PETER PAN!

431
00:21:57,589 --> 00:21:59,341
IF I COULD ONLY FIND HIS HIDEOUT,

432
00:21:59,716 --> 00:22:01,593
I'D TRAP HIM IN HIS LAIR.

433
00:22:02,427 --> 00:22:03,387
BUT WHERE IS IT?

434
00:22:04,555 --> 00:22:05,556
MERMAID LAGOON?

435
00:22:07,307 --> 00:22:08,851
NO, WE'VE SEARCHED THAT.

436
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,062
WE'VE COMBED CANNIBAL COVE.

437
00:22:13,939 --> 00:22:14,898
HERE?

438
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:16,900
NO, NO, NO!

439
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:18,569
THAT'S INDIAN TERRITORY...

440
00:22:20,404 --> 00:22:21,154
BUT WAIT.

441
00:22:22,656 --> 00:22:24,533
THOSE REDSKINS KNOWTHIS ISLAND...

442
00:22:24,658 --> 00:22:27,035
BETTER THAN I DO ME OWN SHIP.

443
00:22:27,327 --> 00:22:28,912
AH...

444
00:22:29,454 --> 00:22:31,456
I WONDER.

445
00:22:32,207 --> 00:22:33,500
GOOD MORNING, CAPTAIN.

446
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:34,501
I'VE GOT IT!

447
00:22:35,252 --> 00:22:36,587
TIGER LILY, SMEE!

448
00:22:37,254 --> 00:22:38,922
TIGER LILY, CAP'N?

449
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:40,591
THE CHIEF'S DAUGHTER.

450
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:42,718
SHE'LL KNOWWHERE PAN IS HIDING.

451
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:46,013
BUT-BUT-BUT, WILL SHE TALK, CAP'N?

452
00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:48,599
A LITTLE PERSUASION...

453
00:22:49,224 --> 00:22:50,350
MIGHT BE IN ORDER.

454
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:52,102
NOW, LET ME SEE.

455
00:22:53,228 --> 00:22:54,313
BOILING IN OIL?

456
00:22:56,398 --> 00:22:57,816
KEELHAULING?

457
00:22:58,692 --> 00:23:00,444
MAROONING?

458
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:04,198
OH, A PIRATE'S LIFE IS A WONDERFUL LIFE

459
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:08,744
YOU'LL FIND ADVENTURE AND SPORT

460
00:23:09,328 --> 00:23:10,787
BUT LIVE EVERY MINUTE

461
00:23:10,996 --> 00:23:12,664
FOR ALL THAT IS IN IT

462
00:23:13,165 --> 00:23:18,337
THE LIFE OF A PIRATE IS SHO-OO-RT

463
00:23:19,004 --> 00:23:22,966
OH, THE LIFE...

464
00:23:29,806 --> 00:23:31,725
NOW LET ME SEE. WHERE WAS I?

465
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:33,602
OH, DEAR, CAP'N HOOK.

466
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,938
SHOOTING A MAN IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS
CADENZA,

467
00:23:37,523 --> 00:23:38,607
IT AIN'T GOOD FORM.

468
00:23:39,775 --> 00:23:42,110
GOOD FORM, MR. SMEE?

469
00:23:42,861 --> 00:23:44,112
BLAST GOOD FORM!

470
00:23:44,655 --> 00:23:47,741
DID PAN SHOW GOOD FORM WHEN HE DID THIS TO
ME?

471
00:23:48,534 --> 00:23:49,243
WHY, CAP'N,

472
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:52,412
CUTTING YOUR HAND OFF WAS A CHILDISH
PRANK.

473
00:23:53,247 --> 00:23:55,874
AYE, BUT THROWING IT TO THE CROCODILE!

474
00:23:56,542 --> 00:23:59,211
THAT CURSED BEAST LIKED THE TASTE OF ME SO
WELL,

475
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,004
HE'S FOLLOWED ME EVER SINCE,

476
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:04,967
LICKING HIS CHOPS FOR THE REST OF ME.

477
00:24:06,218 --> 00:24:07,427
HE'D OF HAD YOU BY NOW...

478
00:24:08,178 --> 00:24:10,138
IF HE HADN'T SWALLOWED THAT ALARM CLOCK.

479
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:11,932
BUT NOWWHEN HE'S ABOUT,

480
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:13,976
HE WARNS YOU, AS YOU MIGHT SAY,

481
00:24:14,184 --> 00:24:16,353
WITH HIS TICK-TOCK, TICK-TOCK.

482
00:24:49,553 --> 00:24:50,929
SMEE-E-E-E!

483
00:24:51,263 --> 00:24:52,931
PLEASE DON'T LET HIM GET ME!

484
00:24:53,849 --> 00:24:54,725
DON'T LET HIM GET ME!

485
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:59,563
SHAME ON YOU, UPSETTING THE POOR CAP'N.

486
00:25:00,397 --> 00:25:01,732
THERE'LL BE NO HANDOUTS TODAY!

487
00:25:02,107 --> 00:25:03,025
SHOO!

488
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:04,610
OFF WITH YOU!

489
00:25:04,902 --> 00:25:05,903
GO AWAY! OUT OF HERE!

490
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:12,367
IS HE GONE, SMEE?

491
00:25:12,743 --> 00:25:14,036
CAP'N, ALL CLEAR.

492
00:25:14,536 --> 00:25:15,954
NOTHING TO WORRYABOUT.

493
00:25:16,246 --> 00:25:17,039
OH, SMEE,

494
00:25:17,748 --> 00:25:19,041
I CAN'T STAND IT ANY LONGER.

495
00:25:20,292 --> 00:25:22,628
NOW, NOW, CAPTAIN. JUST RELAX.

496
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:25,422
WHAT YOU NEED IS A SHAVE;

497
00:25:26,173 --> 00:25:27,966
A NICE, SOOTHING SHAVE.

498
00:25:29,134 --> 00:25:30,052
THERE, NOW.

499
00:25:31,428 --> 00:25:34,223
OH, A PIRATE'S LIFE IS A
WONDERFUL LIFE

500
00:25:34,598 --> 00:25:36,308
A SAILING OVER THE SEA

501
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:38,560
GIVE ME A CAREER AS A BUCCANEER

502
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:40,729

00:34:17,621 --> 00:34:19,164
IS AN ENCIRCLING MANEUVER.

669
00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:49,069
JOHN, INDIANS!

670
00:34:51,947 --> 00:34:53,031
LET ME IN!

671
00:34:56,702 --> 00:34:57,911
REMEMBER,

672
00:34:58,245 --> 00:35:00,164
THE INDIAN IS CUNNING, BUT NOT
INTELLIGENT.

673
00:35:01,623 --> 00:35:04,585
WE SIMPLY SURROUND THEM, AND TAKE THEM BY
SURPRISE...

674
00:35:36,241 --> 00:35:38,368
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY, OLD CHAPS.

675
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:40,329
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

676
00:35:40,537 --> 00:35:42,498
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, WILDCAT.

677
00:35:42,998 --> 00:35:44,041
WE DON'T MIND.

678
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:45,626
WE ARE OK.

679
00:35:50,672 --> 00:35:51,507
HOW.

680
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:53,217
HI, CHIEF.

WHEN THEYWIN, THEYTURN US LOOSE.

690
00:36:15,447 --> 00:36:18,242
THIS TIME, NO TURN 'EM LOOSE.

691
00:36:20,577 --> 00:36:21,829
THE CHIEF'S A GREAT SPOOFER.

692
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,664
ME NO SPOOF 'EM!

693
00:36:24,456 --> 00:36:26,625

00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:28,418
TIGER LILY?

695
00:36:28,627 --> 00:36:29,461
WE AIN'T GOT HER!

696
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,505
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER.

697
00:36:31,797 --> 00:36:32,840
ME NEITHER.

698
00:36:33,006 --> 00:36:34,508
HEAP BIG LIE.

699
00:36:35,884 --> 00:36:36,718
IF TIGER LILY...

00:36:36,885 --> 00:36:38,303

BURN 'EM AT STAKE.

702
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:03,287
JUST IMAGINE,

703
00:37:04,037 --> 00:37:05,747
REAL LIVE MERMAIDS.

704
00:37:06,165 --> 00:37:09,001
WOULD YOU LIKE TO MEET THEM? I'D LOVE TO

705
00:37:09,168 --> 00:37:10,252

I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU.

712
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,189
WHY DID YOU STAYAWAY SO LONG?

713
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:32,441
DID YOU MISS ME?

714

716
00:37:38,238 --> 00:37:39,198
AND THREW IT TO THE CROCODILE.

717
00:37:39,698 --> 00:37:41,617

719
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,495
I WAS ON A ROCK...

720
00:37:45,871 --> 00:37:46,830

A THOUSAND PARDONS, MY DEAR.

1184
01:03:53,188 --> 01:03:55,691
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU ARE IN ON OUR LITTLE
JOKE.

1185

SORT OF A SURPRISE PACKAGE,
YOU MIGHT SAY.

1187
01:04:03,991 --> 01:04:06,827
WHY, I CAN SEE OUR LITTLE FRIEND AT THIS
MOMENT,

1188
01:04:07,452 --> 01:04:10,956
READING THE TENDER INSCRIPTION.

1191
01:04:21,008 --> 01:04:21,508
HUH?

1192
01:04:21,675 --> 01:04:22,843
I WONDER WHAT'S IN IT?

1193
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:25,888
COULD HE BUT SEE WITHIN THE
PACKAGE,

1194
01:04:26,471 --> 01:04:30,058
HE WOULD FIND AN INGENIOUS LITTLE DEVICE.

1195
01:04:30,934 --> 01:04:33,395
SET SO WHEN THE CLOCK IS LIKE
THIS,

1196
01:04:33,854 --> 01:04:34,730

15 SECONDS.

13 SECONDS.

1205
01:05:00,047 --> 01:05:00,839
12 SECONDS.

1206
01:05:02,174 --> 01:05:03,342
I GUESS I COULD OPEN IT NOW.

1207
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:08,096
TING-A-LING!

1208

01:05:16,063 --> 01:05:17,481
TING-A-LING. TING-A-LING! A BOMB?

1212
01:05:18,524 --> 01:05:19,775
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

1213
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,913
SO PASSETH A WORTHY OPPONENT.

1214
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:34,623
AMEN.

1215
01:05:40,003 --> 01:05:41,797
HOOK! IT WAS A BOMB.

1216
01:05:42,506 --> 01:05:44,007
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR TINK...

01:05:45,217 --> 01:05:46,176
TINKERBELL?

1218

1227
01:06:21,837 --> 01:06:22,713
HOLD ON, TINK.

1228
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,840
TING-A... DON'T GO OUT.

1229
01:06:25,757 --> 01:06:26,717
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

1230
01:06:27,426 --> 01:06:30,220
YOU MEAN MORE TO ME THAN
ANYTHING IN THIS WHOLE WORLD!

1231
01:06:33,265 --> 01:06:35,142
AND NOW, WHICH WILL IT BE?

01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:38,061
THE PEN... OR THE PLANK?

1233
01:06:39,021 --> 01:06:42,107
CAPT. HOOK, WE WILL NEVER JOIN YOUR CREW.

1234
01:06:42,566 --> 01:06:45,235
AS YOU WISH. LADIES FIRST, M'DEAR.

COULD YOU TELL ME, SIR, WHERE WE'RE

1328
01:13:21,465 --> 01:13:22,674

1329
01:13:23,133 --> 01:13:24,343

01:14:17,437 --> 01:14:18,522
ARF. ARF.

1335
01:14:18,856 --> 01:14:19,773
GEORGE, I'M SO GLAD...

1336
01:14:19,982 --> 01:14:21,275
AFTER ALL, YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND ABOUT
WENDY.

1337
01:14:21,984 --> 01:14:23,318
SHE'S STILL A CHILD.

1338
01:14:24,528 --> 01:14:26,947
MARY, YOU KNOW I NEVER MEAN THOSE THINGS.

1339
01:14:27,739 --> 01:14:28,532
DO I, NANA?

1340
01:14:31,869 --> 01:14:32,828
OH!

1341
01:14:34,371 --> 01:14:35,080
WENDY?

1342
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:40,335
WENDY, WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING THERE?

1343
01:14:41,211 --> 01:14:41,753
HMM?

1344
01:14:45,549 --> 01:14:47,551
OH MOTHER, WE'RE BACK!

1345
01:14:48,218 --> 01:14:48,844
BACK?

1346
01:14:49,178 --> 01:14:51,221
EXCEPT THE LOST BOYS. THEYWEREN'T READY.

1347
01:14:51,889 --> 01:14:53,974
LOST BO...? READY? TO GROW UP.

1348
01:14:54,391 --> 01:14:57,144
THAT'S WHYTHEYWENT BACKTO NEVERLAND.
NEVERLAND?

1349
01:14:57,769 --> 01:14:59,563
YES, BUT, I AM.

1350
01:15:00,063 --> 01:15:01,023
UH, AM?

1351
01:15:02,065 --> 01:15:03,233
READYTO GROW UP.

1352
01:15:03,775 --> 01:15:04,693
OH, OH!

1353
01:15:05,068 --> 01:15:08,739
WELL WISH, MY DEAR, ALL IN GOOD
TIME.

1354
01:15:09,615 --> 01:15:12,159
AFTER ALL, PERHAPS WE WERE... BUT MOTHER,

1355
01:15:12,659 --> 01:15:14,369
IT WAS SUCH A WONDERFUL ADVENTURE,

1356
01:15:15,078 --> 01:15:16,580
TINKERBELL, AND THE MERMAIDS,

1357
01:15:16,914 --> 01:15:19,666
AND PETER PAN! HE WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL
OF ALL!

1358
01:15:20,167 --> 01:15:21,835
WHEN KIDNAPP...

1359
01:15:22,252 --> 01:15:22,920
KIDNAPPED?

1360
01:15:23,253 --> 01:15:24,755
UH-HMM. I KNEW PETER PAN...

1361
01:15:25,130 --> 01:15:26,590
WOULD SAVE US, AND HE DID.

1362
01:15:26,882 --> 01:15:28,800
WE ALL CALLED HIM A CODFISH!

1363
01:15:29,801 --> 01:15:31,011
CAPTAIN HOOK, I MEAN.

1364
01:15:31,428 --> 01:15:32,262
AND THEN...

1365
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:35,098
WE SAILED AWAY ON A SHIP IN THE SKY.

1366
01:15:35,849 --> 01:15:38,811
AH, MARY, I'M GOING TO BED.

1367
01:15:40,729 --> 01:15:41,647
OH, MOTHER,

1368
01:15:42,439 --> 01:15:44,316
HE REALLY IS WONDERFUL, ISN'T HE?

1369
01:15:45,567 --> 01:15:47,611
SEE HOWWELL HE SAILS THE SHIP.

1370
01:15:48,737 --> 01:15:50,239
GEORGE? GEORGE!

1371
01:15:50,739 --> 01:15:51,824
NOWWHAT, MARY?

1372
01:15:54,535 --> 01:15:55,452
WHO?

1373
01:15:56,370 --> 01:15:57,871
NANA, DID YOU SEE...

1374
01:15:58,455 --> 01:15:59,414
ARF. ARF.

1375
01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:03,085
YOU KNOW, I HAVE THE STRANGEST FEELING...

1376
01:16:03,418 --> 01:16:04,878
THAT I'VE SEEN THAT SHIP BEFORE,

1377
01:16:05,963 --> 01:16:07,005
A LONG TIME AGO...

1378
01:16:08,257 --> 01:16:09,758
WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG.

1379
01:16:10,884 --> 01:16:11,844
GEORGE, DEAR.

1380
01:16:12,427 --> 01:16:13,137
FATHER.

1381
01:16:15,305 --> 01:16:17,766
WHEN THERE'S A SMILE IN YOUR HEART

1382
01:16:18,142 --> 01:16:21,478
THERE'S NO BETTER TIME TO START

1383
01:16:23,897 --> 01:16:25,858
THINK OF ALL THE JOYYOU'LL FIND

1384
01:16:26,191 --> 01:16:27,734
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE WORLD BEHIND

1385
01:16:28,068 --> 01:16:29,486
AND BID YOUR CARES GOODBYE

1386
01:16:31,446 --> 01:16:33,365
YOU CAN FLY

1387
01:16:34,408 --> 01:16:36,243
YOU CAN FLY

1388
01:16:37,786 --> 01:16:42,916
YOU CAN FLY

1389
01:16:43,417 --> 01:16:46,920
over

1390
01:16:56,930 --> 01:16:59,725
SkyFury
