MAN:
Vampires and sexuality.

Now, some argue that the
insatiable thirst for blood,

that makes vampires
metaphorically sexual creatures.

Bram Stoker:

133
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,620
he takes vampires
as a sex metaphor

134
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,460
to a whole new level.

135
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,830
He creates Dracula
as a queer figure.

136
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,120
So in contrast to Dracula,

So, their quest to end Dracula,

144
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,790
it's also to reaffirm

145
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,830
that their own homosocial bonds
aren't queer.

00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,620
<i>But now, in our day,
we have Teen Mom shows,</i>

174
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,960
and everyone
can just use condoms.

175
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,040
<i>The first Twilight book
was great</i>

176
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,790
because it equated teen sex
with death again.

177
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,460
And then they screwed
it up in the later books,

178
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,790
when he starts holding out
just because

179
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,500
he's a "Victorian gentleman."

180
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,330
And then they actually get
married as teens to have sex,

181
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,380
which is just a way
to cash in on teen sexuality

182
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,120
while trying to seem
morally responsible.

183
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,170
It's absurd.

184
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,960
Very interesting thoughts.

185
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,960
You can all

186
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,460
catch them, too, on Leah's
podcast for pop culture.

187
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,290
(laughter)

188
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,290
So, please, join it.

189
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,460
You know what?

190
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,920
I think we're
gonna end on that.

191
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,040
Your next reading chapters
will be listed in the syllabus.

192
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,120
Be careful of vampires.
Good-bye.

193
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,540
Have a good day.

194
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,750
(indistinct chatter)

195
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,040
Hey, Leah!
Leah, wait up!

196
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,250
Oh, hey, Bob.

197
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,710
Hey.

198
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,710
Ready for auditions tonight?

199
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,830
Oh, yeah.

200
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,290
I'm a little nervous.

201
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,080
<i>Macbeth is tough.</i>

202
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,620
Yeah.

203
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,670
You're gonna get
Lady Macbeth.

204
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,290
I mean, you're amazing.

205
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,620
Thanks.

206
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,290
So you ready for the, uh,

207
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,120
country club
Halloween party this year?

208
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,000
My parents told me
that your mom's

209
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,170
been doing a lot
of the planning?

210
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,960
Yeah, she gets so into it.

211
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,210
It's so embarrassing.

212
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,710
(chuckles)

213
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,710
Um,

214
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,790
I'm gonna go study
my lines, okay?

215
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,290
Yeah, sure.

216
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,460
Okay.

217
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,460
I'll see you tonight?

218
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,960
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, of course.

219
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,040
All right.

220
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,290
Break a leg!
(chuckles)

221
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,710
Thanks.

222
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,500
(bell tolling)

223
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,120
<i>BOB:
 And all our yesterdays</i>

224
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,040
have lighted fools
the way to dusty death.

225
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,710
Out!

226
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,080
Out, brief candle!

227
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,290
Life's but a walking shadow.

228
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,920
A poor player that struts

229
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,250
and frets his hour
upon the stage

230
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,040
and then is heard no more.

231
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,040
It is a tale

232
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,920
told by an idiot,

233
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,000
full of sound

234
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,460
and fury...

235
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,380
signifying

236
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,750
nothing.

237
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,790
Great, Bob.

238
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,120
Good job.

239
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,330
I can tell you were
working on that.

240
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,960
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

241
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,040
Okay, thank you.

242
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,210
Okay, is there, uh,

243
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,830
is there anyone
else for Macbeth?

244
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,000
Leah.

245
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,710
For-for Macbeth?

246
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:02,170
Yeah, I would like
to play Macbeth.

247
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,380
Uh...

248
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,250
Okay, fine with me.

249
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,710
Give it a shot.

250
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,330
Just like
we practiced.

251
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,290
Yeah.

252
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,330
(clears throat)

253
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,000
(deep breath)

254
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,120
This'll be interesting.

255
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,710
We will proceed
no further in this business.

256
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,790
He hath honored me of late

257
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,000
and I have bought
golden opinions

258
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,170
from all sorts of people
which would be worn now

259
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,620
in their newest gloss,
not cast aside so soon.

260
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,000
I would...

261
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,500
LEAH:
Prithee, peace.

262
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,540
I dare do all that may
become a man.

263
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,960
Who dare do more is none.

264
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,290
If we should fail...

265
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,670
And we shall not fail.

266
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,750
Bring forth men
children only.

267
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:05,000
For thy undaunted metal should
compose nothing but nails.

268
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,620
Will it not be received when we

269
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,460
have marked with blood those
sleepy to of his own chamber

270
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,330
and used their very daggers

271
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:16,290
that they have done't?

272
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,210
Who dares
receive it other?

273
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,500
I am settled

274
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,790
and bend up
each corporal agent

275
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,380
to this terrible feat.

276
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,620
Away.

277
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,500
And mock the time
with fairest show.

278
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,330
May false face hide

279
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,880
what the false heart doth know.

280
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,500
(quietly):
That was, um...

281
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,790
(clears throat)

282
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,000
That was something.

283
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,880
Yes.

284
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,330
All right, um...

285
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,120
ladies, that was, uh,

286
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,670
that was interesting.

287
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,330
Uh, two Lady Macbeths.

288
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,580
I like it.

289
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,670
Okay, good job.

290
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,460
And good job, everyone.

291
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,790
I'll post the results
later this week.

292
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,080
Really good work.

293
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,120
(indistinct chatter)

294
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,460
(dog barking in distance)

295
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,880
<i>WOMAN:
 So, how's it going in there?</i>

296
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,250
Fine.

297
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,620
You know,
I miss you being around

298
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,790
more than just on laundry day.

299
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,210
Mom, come on,
at least I'm close.

300
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,120
I could have gone
out of state.

301
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,500
(gasps)

302
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,250
And I'm just
giving you a hard time.

303
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,500
(laughs)

304
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,960
Oh.

305
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,120
I wanted to show the invitation.

306
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,250
The invites went out this week.

307
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,620
Looks good.

308
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,500
I think it's gonna be
even better than last year.

309
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,330
You're gonna have
a great time.

310
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,580
You always do a great job.

311
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,500
Oh, thanks, baby.

312
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,170
So...

313
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,670
how did the audition go?

314
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,670
Good, I think.

315
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,620
(sighs)

316
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,960
Isn't Macbeth, like,
one of the bloodiest plays?

317
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,170
So what?

318
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,790
So, I don't know.

319
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,120
Are you sure you want
to be around all of that?

320
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,250
Mom, it's a play.

321
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,330
William Shakespeare.
They do it in elementary school.

322
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,620
I know that.

323
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,000
But not everyone
has been through

324
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
what you've been through.

325
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,830
I'll be fine.

326
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,380
Okay.

327
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,120
So I was wondering
if I can invite

328
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,120
someone over for dinner
on Friday night?

329
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,670
Who?

330
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,620
Um, just someone

331
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,460
special I want you to meet.

332
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,460
Leah?

333
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,330
"Just someone special"?

334
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,830
Of course, yes.

335
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,290
That would be great.

336
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,710
Don't make a big deal
about it, okay?

337
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,500
Who? Me?

338
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,790
No, I...

339
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,790
I got this.

<i>PEARL: Most of the time,
it's torture.</i>

1021

<i>LEAH: Why?</i>

1022
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,750
I always thirst.

1023
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:06,080

1024
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,420
<i> I try to resist it, but...</i>

1025
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:13,080
<i> most of the time, I give in.</i>

1026

<i>LEAH:
 How many?</i>

1027
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,080
<i>PEARL:
 I don't know.</i>

1028
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,920
<i> Probably, like, eight.</i>

1029
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,420
<i> They're all bad people,</i>

1032

No,

1033
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,920
<i> they didn't.</i>

1034
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,710
I don't want to do this anymore.

1035
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:33,250

1036
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:36,830
<i>PEARL:
 I don't know.</i>

1037
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:39,920
<i> Maybe I'll just lock myself
in a room or something.</i>

1038
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,920
<i>LEAH:

<i>PEARL: Maybe. Maybe that's
what I deserve.</i>

1040

<i>LEAH:
 Is there any other way?</i>

1041
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,920
Yeah, there's another way.

1042
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,580
<i>LEAH:
 What?</i>

1043
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:54,250
<i>PEARL:
 I don't want to tell you.</i>

1044
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,580
Tell me. I want to know.

1045
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:57,960
<i>PEARL:
 If a nightwalker</i>

1046

<i> finds their one true love,
and then they can turn them,</i>

1047
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:04,120
<i> and then they can live
off of each other forever.</i>

1048
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,750
<i> They call it an eternal bond.</i>

1049
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:10,120
Then I want you to make me
a nightwalker, Pearl.

1050
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,580
No.

1051
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,580
Why not? Don't
you love me?

1052
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,080
Yes. I do love you.

1053
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,380
That is exactly why
I can't do that to you.

1054
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:18,120
But I want you to. If it means
that we can be together,

1055
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,750
if it means that
I can help you.

1056
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,750
No.

1057
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,170
I don't want you
to suffer anymore.

1058
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:23,040
All it means
is that you suffer, too.

1059
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,420
You are in danger.
I have put you in danger.

1060
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,250
You cannot trust me.
They made me pick you

1061
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:29,620
just to turn you, but then
I fell in love with you,

1062
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:32,120
and I don't want to...

1063

If you stay around,
they're just gonna turn you.

1070
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:52,830
Then you turn me.

1071
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:52,830
No.

1072
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:54,580

What? Why? Pearl, why?

1077
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:04,710
Pearl, I'm not leaving.

1078
