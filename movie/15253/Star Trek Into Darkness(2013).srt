1
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,074


2
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,731


3
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,096
该死，老兄！那是我们的交通工具！
Damn it, man! That was our ride!

3
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:36,800
你刚把我们的交通工具给杀了！(麦考伊-人类-医疗官)
 You just stunned our ride!

4
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:38,138
(柯克-人类-舰长)

5
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,182
哦，太好了
Oh, great.

5
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,476
快跑
Run!

6
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,275
你到底拿了什么？
What the hell did you take?

7
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,236
我不知道，不过他们都屈服于它
I have no idea,but they were bowing to it.

8
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,238
Kirk呼叫穿梭一号机
Kirk to Shuttle One.

9
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,948
本地物种已经离开危险地带
Locals are out of the kill zone.

10
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,282
你可以开始了，重复
You are clear. Repeat.

11
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,120
Spock，快去中和火山，然后我们离开这个地方
Spock, get in there, neutralize the
volcano and let's get out of here.

12
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,170
我们必须现在就做！我跟舰长说过
(苏鲁-人类-舵手)
We have to do this now!I told the Captain

13
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,339
穿梭机不能承受这么大的热量
the shuttle wasn't built for this kind of heat.

14
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,800
船长，本地的生命形态看到你没有？
(史波克-瓦肯与人类混血-大幅兼科学官)
Captain, did the indigenous life forms see you?

15
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,719
没有，Spock先生，他们没看见我
No, Mr. Spock, they did not.

16
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,053
原则上明确指出
The Prime Directive clearly states

17
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,346
我们不可以以任何形式
there can be no interference

18
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,515
干预外星文明的发展进程
with the internal development of alien civilizations.

19
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,142
我知道那个原则！这也是我跑的原因
I know what it says! Which is why I'm running

20
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,601
穿过森林，还穿着伪装！
through the jungle wearing a disguise!

21
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,356
现在卸下你那个超级冰块，我们走！
Now drop off your super ice cube and let's go!

21
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,356
Kirk 完毕！
Kirk out!

22
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,774
可以出发了
You're good.

23
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,484
如果我们要做的话，最好是现在！
If we're gonna do this,we've got to do it now!

24
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,320
这灰尘在腐蚀我们的线圈
This ash is killing our coils.

25
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,822
你确定不用我替你去？
You sure you don't want me to go instead?

26
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,033
那将会十分的不符合逻辑，因为我已经穿好了...
That would be highly illogical as I am already outfitted...

27
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,743
Spock，我在开玩笑
Spock, I was kidding.

28
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,830
-你应得的。-大伙！我们得出发了！现在！
- You got this.- Guys! We have to go! Now!

29
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,216
他们想要杀了我们！
They're trying to kill us!

30
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,677
他们想要杀了我们，Jim！
They're trying to kill us, Jim!

31
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,346
我们90秒钟后见(乌乎拉-人类-通讯官)
I'll see you in 90 seconds.

32
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,519
快点，快点
Do it, do it!

33
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,245
前提条件变更，2-7-3
<i>Prerequisite change, 2-7-3...</i>

34
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,749
引擎过热
ENGINE OVERHEATING

35
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,376
我无法保持现在的位置
I can't hold this position.

36
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,919
Spock，我得把你拉回来
Spock, I've got to pull you back up.

37
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,713
不可以。这是我们唯一机会去保护这个物种
Negative. This is our only chance to save this species.

38
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,548
如果火山爆发了，这个星球就完了。
If this volcano erupts, the planet dies.

39
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,387
把他拉回来，现在
Pull him back up. Now!

40
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,903
Spock，你没事吧？
<i>Spock, are you okay?</i>

41
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,743
我
I am,

42
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,579
很惊讶，还活着。原地待命
surprisingly, alive. Stand by.

43
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,832
我们得把他弄回来。我去穿上防护服。我要下去。
We have to get him back.I'll suit up. I'm gonna go down.

44
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,083
我们得弃船了。
We have to abandon the shuttle.

45
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,085
-我们不能把他扔在这里，Sulu！-我们没有选择！
- We can't just leave him, Sulu!
- We don't have a choice!

46
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,586
Uhura，我很抱歉
Uhura, I'm sorry.

47
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,755
Spock，我们要回到企业号上
Spock, we're going back to the <i>Enterprise.</i>

48
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,798
我们会把你弄出来的
<i>We'll get you out of there.</i>

49
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,633
船长，我要弃船了
Captain, I'm ditching the shuttle.

50
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,427
回到企业号，全靠你们自己了
You've got to make it to the <i>Enterprise</i> on your own.

51
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,845
太好了！
<i>Wonderful!</i>

52
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,431
-Uhura！准备好游泳了吗？-我准备好了
- Uhura! You ready to swim? - I'm ready.

53
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,684
Jim!

54
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,521
Jim！海岸在那边！
Jim! The beach is that way!

55
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,273
我知道！我们不是要去海岸！
I know! We're not going to the beach!

56
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,275
哦，不不不！
Oh, no, no, no!

57
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,197
我讨厌这个！
I hate this!

58
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,490
我知道
I know you do!

58
00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:10,490
联邦星舰企业号 NCC-1701（又译成进取号）
U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701 

59
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,327
你知道不知道这有多滑稽
(斯科特-人类-轮机长)
Do you have any idea how ridiculous it is

60
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,828
把一个飞船藏在海底？
to hide a starship on the bottom of the ocean?

61
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,330
从昨天晚上到现在
We've been down here since last night!

62
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,706
海水的盐分要毁掉...
The salt water's gonna ruin the...

63
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,667
Scotty！Spock在哪？
Scotty! Where's Spock?

64
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,834
还在火山里，先生
Still in the volcano, sir.

65
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,169
舰长在舷！
Captain on the bridge!

66
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,922
上尉，我们有直通Spock先生的频道吗？
Lieutenant, do we have
an open channel to Mr. Spock?

67
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,258
热量正破坏他的通讯器，不过我们依然保持着通信
The heat's frying his comms,but we still have contact.

68
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,594
Spock?

69
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,888
我已经启动装置了，船长
I have activated the device, Captain.

70
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,973
当倒数结束的时候
When the countdown is complete,

71
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,558
反应堆会使火山堕化
the reaction should render the volcano inert.

72
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,976
是啊，那也会使他堕化
Yeah, and that's gonna render him inert!

73
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,394
我们还有能用的传送器吗？
Do we have use of the transporters?

74
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,104
-不可以，先生。-在磁场里不行
- Negative, sir.
- Not with these magnetic fields.

75
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,772
我需要把Spock传送回来
I need to beam Spock back to the ship.

76
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,441
给我一个能做到的方法
Give me one way to do it.

77
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,735
也许如果我们能够在视野中看到他
Maybe if we had a direct line of sight.

78
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,902
-如果我们接近 -等等，兄弟！
- If we got closer...
- Hold on, wee man!

79
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,571
你说的可是那座活火山
You're talking about an active volcano!

80
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,239
长官，如果那个东西爆发了
Sir, if that thing erupts,

81
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,991
我无法保证我们能经受的住那的热量
I cannot guarantee
we can withstand the heat!

82
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,243
我不知道我们能否保持在那种高度上
I don't know that we can
maintain that kind of altitude.

83
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,786
我们的穿梭机已经被火山灰毁了
Our shuttle was concealed
by the ash cloud,

84
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,246
但是企业号太大了
but the <i>Enterprise</i> is too large.

85
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,331
如果利用企业号来尝试救援的话
If utilized in a rescue effort,

86
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,000
她会暴露给那些本土物种
<i>it would be revealed
to the indigenous species.</i>

87
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,002
Spock，没有人比你更了解这些规定
Spock, nobody knows the rules better than you,

88
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,920
但是，总有例外的时候
but there has got to be an exception.

89
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,256
不可以，这样的行动违背了原则
None. Such action violates
the Prime Directive.

90
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,258
闭嘴，Spock！我们正在努力的救你呢，该死的！
Shut up, Spock! We're trying
to save you, damn it!

91
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:08,178
医生，不能因为个人利益牺牲大家都利益
Doctor, the needs of
the many outweigh the needs of the few.

92
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,388
Spock，我们现在说的是你的生命！
Spock, we're talking about your life!

93
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,598
规则是不能被打破的...
<i>The rule cannot be broken...</i>

94
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,142
Spock!

95
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:15,518
尝试恢复他的通讯
Try to get him back online.

96
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,646
距离目标90秒
Ninety seconds to detonations.

97
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:23,318
如果Spock在这儿，我在那儿，他会怎么做？
If Spock were here
and I were there, what would he do?

98
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,989
他会让你死在那里的
He'd let you die.

99
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,217
Spock!

100
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,219
你还好吗？
You all right?

101
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,055
舰长，你让他们看到我们的飞船了
Captain, you let them see our ship.

102
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,765
他没事
He's fine.

103
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,892
-呼叫Kirk舰长。-收到，中尉
<i>- Bridge to Captain Kirk.</i>
- Yes, Lieutenant.

104
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,061
Spock长官回舰了吗，先生？
Is Commander Spock on board, sir?

105
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,145
完好无损
<i>Safely and soundly.</i>

106
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,897
那么请告诉他，他的装置
Please notify him that his device

107
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,523
成功的触发了
<i>has successfully detonated.</i>

108
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,651
你听到没有，祝贺你Spock
<i>You hear that? Congratulations, Spock.</i>

109
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,071
你刚刚拯救了他们的世界
You just saved the world.

110
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,073
你违反了原则
You violated the Prime Directive.

111
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,742
哦，拜托，Spock。他们看见我们了，多大个事儿啊
Oh, come on, Spock. They saw us. Big deal.

我能救她
I can save her.

116
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,574
你说什么？
What did you say?

117
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,284
你女儿
Your daughter.

118
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,246
我能救她
I can save her.

119
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,748
你是谁？
Who are you?

120
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,686
哦，Jim，得了，让它响吧。
Oh, Jim. Come on, let it go.

121
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:51,771
Jim!

122
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,691
你不是想要接电话吧，是吗？
You're not actually gonna
answer that, are you?

SAN FRANCISCO
STARFLEET HQ

124
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,320
Spock，我跟你说，这就是他打电话的原因，我能感觉到
Spock, I'm telling you,
this is why he called. I can feel it.

125
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,656
不提你的感觉，我觉得
Your feeling aside,
I consider it highly unlikely

126
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,950
我们没可能被选入新的任务
that we will be selected
for the new program.

127
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,327
否则为什么Pike要见我们？
Why else would Pike want to see us?

128
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:07,787
别去管什么资历了
Forget about seniority.

129
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,247
他们把舰队最新的飞船给我们了
They gave us the newest ship
in the fleet.

130
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,498
我的意思是，除了我们还会有谁能行？
I mean, who else
are they gonna send out?

131
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:11,583
我可以想到无数种可能性
I can think of numerous possibilities.

132
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,877
一个五年的任务，Spock！
A five-year mission, Spock!

133
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,338
宇宙的深层空间！未知的疆域！
That's deep space!
That's uncharted territory!

134
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,464
想象一下那会多么不可思议。
Think how incredible that's gonna be.

135
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,050
嘿，女士们，Jim Kirk
Hey, ladies. Jim Kirk.

136
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,178
-“无重大事件”-将军？
- "Uneventful."
- Admiral?

137
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,972
这是你在船长日志中描述勘测Nibiru星星的时候写的
(派克-人类-企业号第一任舰长)
It's the way you described the survey of
Nibiru in your captain's log.

138
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,183
呃，是的，先生，我不想在这些细节上浪费您的时间
Yes, sir, I didn't want to waste your time
going over the details.

139
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,143
告诉我关于这座火山更多的细节
Tell me more about this volcano.

140
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,644
数据显示它极不稳定
Data says it was highly volatile.

141
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,271
要是它爆发了，会毁掉那个星球的。
If it were to erupt,
it would wipe out the planet.

142
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,647
我们还是希望它不会，先生
Let's hope it doesn't, sir.

143
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,982
似乎有什么告诉我它不会爆发
Something tells me it won't.

144
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,027
呃，是的，先生，不稳定是相对的
Well, sir, volatile is all relative.

145
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,779
也许我们的数据不准确
Maybe our data was off.

146
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,155
或者也许它根本没爆发
Or maybe it didn't erupt

147
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,824
因为Spock先生捐献出了一个冷核聚变装置
because Mr. Spock detonated
a cold fusion device

148
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,160
就在一个外星文明
inside it right after a civilization

149
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,454
勉强才能发明轮子的时候
that's barely invented the wheel

150
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,499
碰巧看到了一艘飞船，从他们的海里出现
happened to see a starship
rising out of their ocean!

151
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,709
那正是你描述的那样，不是吗？
That is pretty much how
you describe it, is it not?

152
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,586
-将军...-你写了一份报告？
- Admiral...
- You filed a report?

153
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,754
为什么没告诉我？
Why didn't you tell me?

154
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,173
我错误的认为你会如实的填写你的舰长日志
I incorrectly assumed that you would be
truthful in your captain's log.

155
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,842
没错，我确实会的，如果不去救你的小命的话
Yeah, I would have been
if I didn't have to save your life.

156
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,094
事实上我非常感激
A fact for which I am
immeasurably grateful

157
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,679
并且有充分的理由觉得我
and the very reason I felt it necessary

158
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:06,971
应对此行为负责的...
to take responsibility for the actions...

159
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,556
对此负责，是啊
Take responsibility, yeah.

160
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,641
那会是非常高尚的，混血书呆子，
That'd be so noble, pointy,

161
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,226
如果你不把我出卖了的话
if you weren't also
throwing me under the bus.

162
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,311
“混血书呆子”这是贬低我的...
"Pointy"? Is that
a derogatory reference to...

163
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,646
先生们
Gentlemen.

164
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,942
舰队的使命是探索，观察，不是去干预
Starfleet's mandate is to explore and
observe, not to interfere.

165
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,944
让任务按照计划进行，将军
Had the mission gone
according to plan, Admiral,

166
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,195
本地的物种就永远不会
the indigenous species would never

167
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,363
感觉到我们的干预
have been aware of our interference.

168
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,739
那是技术性问题
That's a technicality.

169
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,658
我是瓦肯人，先生。我们信奉技术
I am Vulcan, sir.
We embrace technicality.

170
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,368
你在跟我闹情绪吗，Spock？
Are you giving me attitude, Spock?

171
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,370
我同时表现了多种情绪，先生。
I'm expressing
multiple attitudes simultaneously, sir.

172
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,621
你指的是哪一种？
To which are you referring?

173
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:32,872
出去
Out.

174
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,500
你可以出去了，指挥官
You're dismissed, Commander.

175
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:47,095
你知不知道你有多棘手吗？
You have any idea what
a pain in the ass you are?

176
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,097
我知道，先生。
I think so, sir.

177
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,432
那么你说说你错在哪里了
So tell me what you did wrong.

178
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,434
在这里应该学到什么东西？
What's the lesson to be learned here?

179
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,019
永远不要相信瓦肯人
Never trust a Vulcan.

180
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,646
现在看看，你甚至不去正面回答我的问题。你在撒谎
Now, see, you can't
even answer the question. You lied.

181
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,648
你在一份官方报告中说谎
On an official report, you lied.

182
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,150
你认为规则对你不适用
You think the rules don't apply to you

183
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,401
因为你对规则有不同见解
'cause you disagree with them.

184
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,403
那也正是您当初看中我的地方
That's why you talked me
into signing up in the first place.

185
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:04,654
也正是你把飞船交给我的原因
It's why you gave me your ship.

186
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,907
我把飞船交给你是因为我看到你崇高的一面
I gave you my ship because
I saw a greatness in you.

187
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,494
不过现在，我没有看到你一点谦逊的地方
And now, I see you haven't
got an ounce of humility.

188
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,829
那我该怎么办，让Spock死在那里？
What was I supposed to do,
let Spock die?

189
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,039
你在转移话题
You're missing the point.

190
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,665
我不认为我在转移话题，先生。如果是你，会怎么做？
I don't think I am, sir.
What would you have done?

191
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,625
我根本就不会让我的大幅
I wouldn't have risked
my First Officer's life

192
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,002
冒生命危险去那里！
in the first place!

193
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,004
你是去勘测星球的
You were supposed to survey a planet,

194
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,922
不是去改变它的命运！
not alter its destiny!

195
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,091
你违反了多项舰队规章
You violated a dozen
Starfleet regulations

196
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,344
差点害死你的下属
and almost got everyone
under your command killed.

197
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,887
反对，我没有！
Except I didn't!

198
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,305
你知道我失去了多少队员吗？一个没有！
You know how many
crew members I've lost? Not one!

199
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,390
那正你的问题，你认为你是完人
That's your problem,
you think you're infallible!

200
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,641
你认为你不可能犯错误
You think you can't make a mistake.

201
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,976
你是样板！
It's a pattern with you!

202
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,312
-规则都是给别人定的！-一些应该是的
- The rules are for other people!
- Some should be.

203
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,105
最糟糕的是你靠撞大运
And what's worse is you using blind luck

204
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,316
来给你扮演上帝找借口
to justify your playing God!

205
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,737
考虑到各种因素
Given the circumstances,

206
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,781
已经将这事上报到Marcus将军那里了
this has been brought to
Admiral Marcus's attention.

207
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,617
他召集了一个委员会，我没有被邀请
He convened a special tribunal,
to which I was not invited.

208
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,453
你明白舰队会遵循什么制度
You understand what Starfleet
regulations mandate

209
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:54,621
来授权执行吗
be done at this point.

210
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,710
他们把企业号从你那收回了
They've taken the <i>Enterprise</i>
away from you.

211
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,963
他们要把你送回学院
They're sending you
back to the Academy.

212
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,095
将军，听我说...
Admiral, listen...

213
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,221
-不！我不想听！-我能证明...
- No, I'm not going to listen.
- I can justify...

214
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,305
为什么我应该听？我不想听
Why should I listen?
I'm not going to listen.

215
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:13,682
你除了自己，谁的话都听不进去
You don't listen to anybody but yourself!

216
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,558
我明白制度，但是我的每个决定...
I understand regulation,
but every decision I've made...

217
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:16,643
不！我不想听
No! I can't listen!

218
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,436
你不遵守规定，
You don't comply with the rules,

219
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,647
你对任何事情都不负责任
you don't take responsibility
for anything,

220
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,774
并且你不尊重你的职位
and you don't respect the chair.

221
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,319
你知道为什么吗？
You know why?

222
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,322
因为你还没准备好
Because you're not ready for it.

223
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:47,674
LONDON

224
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,298
KELVIN MEMORIAL ARCHIVE

225
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,037
我需要三个钛...
I'm going to need three titanium...

226
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:44,040
在此区域需要放射性防护装置
<i>Radiation protection
is required in this area.</i>

227
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:57,804
TRANSMISSION SENT

228
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,567
你怎么找到我的？
How did you find me?

229
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,819
我比你想象的更了解你
I know you better than you think I do.

230
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,824
我第一次找到你的时候就是在一家和这个差不多的酒吧
The first time I found you
was in a dive like this.

231
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,745
记得吗？你都被人打蒙了
Remember that? You got
your ass handed to you.

232
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,080
不，我没有
No, I didn't.

233
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,082
-你没有？-不，不是那样的
- You don't?
- No, that's not what happened.

234
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,584
-被打的可真够经典的 -不，不是那样的
- That was an epic beating.
- No, it wasn't.

235
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:11,670
你的鼻子上挂的都是棉条
You had napkins
hanging out of your nose.

236
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:13,838
难道不是？
Did you not?

237
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,842
是啊，那场架打的真过瘾
Yeah, that was a good fight.

238
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,387
过瘾？
"A good fight."

239
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,600
我想这就是你的问题所在了
I think that's your problem right there.

240
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,273
他们把她还给我了
They gave her back to me.

241
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,442
企业号
The <i>Enterprise.</i>

242
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,205
祝贺你
Congratulations.

243
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,502
不过注意点你的那个大幅
Watch your back with
that First Officer, though.

244
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,547
Spock不会和我一起共事了
Spock's not going
to be working with me.

245
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:57,257
他被调离了
He's been transferred.

246
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,801
联邦星舰布拉德伯里号
<i>U.S.S. Bradbury.</i>

247
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,180
你将会是我的大幅
You're going to be my First Officer.

248
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,392
是啊，Marcus被我说服了
Yeah, Marcus took some convincing.

249
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:12,022
时不时的我还是能找出正面的例子
But every now and then
I can make a good case.

250
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,860
你对他说什么了？
What did you tell him?

251
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,112
实话
The truth.

252
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,156
我信任你
That I believe in you.

253
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:26,244
如果有人能得到第二次机会，那个人就是Jim Kirk
That if anybody deserves a second chance, it's Jim Kirk.

254
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,589
我不知道该说什么
I don't know what to say.

255
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:40,133
这是个好的开始
That is a first.

256
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,803
会好起来的，孩子
It's going to be okay, son.

257
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:52,979
紧急会议，Daystrom研究所
(以剧中科学家Richard Daystrom名字命名的研究所)
"Emergency session, Daystrom."

258
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:55,774
是找我们
That's us.

259
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:57,400
好的
Yeah.

260
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,694
穿上制服
Suit up.

261
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:14,167
所有舰队的成员，请注意
<i>All Starfleet personnel,
please be advised,</i>

262
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:17,170
-新的安全计划正在实施中 -舰长
<i>- new security protocols are in effect.</i>
- Captain.

263
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,339
不再是了，Spock，现在是大幅
Not anymore, Spock. First Officer.

264
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:23,176
我被降职了，你被调离了
I was demoted
and you were reassigned.

265
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,011
我们很幸运事件引发的结果
It is fortunate that the consequences

266
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:26,179
还不是十分的严重
were not more severe.

267
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,597
你一定是在耍我
You've got to be kidding me.

268
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:28,765
舰长，我的意图绝对不是...
Captain, it was never my intention...

269
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,016
不是舰长
Not Captain.

270
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,434
我救了你的命，Spock
I saved your life, Spock.

271
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,853
你写了个报告，我丢了飞船
You wrote a report, I lost my ship.

272
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:38,400
长官，我现在觉得我应该提醒你
Commander, I see now
I should have alerted you

273
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:40,151
对于我提交报告这件事上
to the fact that I submitted the report.

274
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:42,070
不，我对你的强迫症很了解
No, I'm familiar with your compulsion

275
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,864
遵循规则。但是你要知道，我办不到
to follow the rules.
But you see, I can't do that.

276
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,575
在我们那里，如果谁救了你的命，
Where I come from,
if someone saves your life,

277
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:48,868
你是不会在他后边捅一刀的
you don't stab him in the back.

278
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,662
瓦肯人不能说谎
Vulcans cannot lie.

279
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,414
那么我说就的是你另一半人类的血统
Then I'm talking
to the half-human part of you.

280
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,082
明白了吗？
All right?

281
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:56,626
你知道我为什么回去救你吗？
Do you understand
why I went back for you?

282
00:22:56,835 --> 00:23:00,171
Spock长官？Frank Abbot 联邦星舰布拉德伯里号
Commander Spock?
Frank Abbot, <i>U.S.S. Bradbury.</i>

283
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,715
我想你应该是跟我们一起了
Guess you're with me.

284
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,884
是的，舰长
Yes, Captain.

285
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,144
说实话
The truth is

286
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,564
我会想你的
I'm going to miss you.

287
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,199
Marcus将军，先生
<i>Admiral Marcus, sir.</i>

288
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:32,370
感谢在这么紧的时间下召集这次会议
Thank you for convening
on such short notice.

289
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:33,663
请坐
Be seated.

290
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,585
到现在为止，你们也许已经听说伦敦发生的事情了
By now, some of you
have heard what happened in London.

291
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,087
目标是星际舰队的数据档案室
The target was a Starfleet data archive.

292
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,339
现在，那已经是一个该死的大坑了
Now it's a damned hole in the ground,

293
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:44,174
42个人死了
42 men and women are dead.

294
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:45,425
一个小时前
One hour ago,

295
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,260
我收到舰队办公室的一个消息
I received a message
from a Starfleet officer,

296
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:49,262
那个实施这次袭击的人
who confessed to
carrying out this attack,

297
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:52,057
是被这个人指使的
that he was being
forced to do it by this man,

298
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,060
指挥官Jhon Harrison。他曾经是我们的一员
Commander John Harrison.
He's one of our own.

299
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:58,229
他就是那个要对这次暴行负责的人
And he is the man responsible
for this act of savagery.

300
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,940
他的目的尚不明确，John Harrison一个人
For reasons unknown,
John Harrison has just declared

301
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,485
对星际舰队宣战了
a one-man war against Starfleet.

302
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:07,405
我们决不允许这个人
And under no circumstances
are we to allow this man

303
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,032
逃离联邦的领域
to escape Federation space.

304
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,493
你们现在代表所有高级长官
You here tonight represent
the senior command

305
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:13,286
所有在领域内的舰艇
of all the vessels in the region.

306
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:16,039
并且以逝者的名义
And in the name of those we lost,

307
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,375
你们要把这个混蛋绳之以法
you will run this bastard down.

308
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:22,712
这是一个追捕行动，目标明确，所以大家开始吧
This is a manhunt,
pure and simple, so let's get to work.

309
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:25,131
地球周边的感应器没有检测到
Earth's perimeter sensors
have not detected

310
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:26,841
任何离开的跃迁信号
any warp signatures leaving the system,

311
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:28,218
所以我们确定他不会太远
so we know he can't be far.

312
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:31,596
你们要把飞船停靠成封锁队形
You will park your ships
in a blockade formation

313
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:34,140
然后部署机动搜查队和登录小队
then deploy search vehicles
and landing parties

314
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:36,976
去追查每一个线索
to run down every lead.

315
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:38,853
这个人不惜杀死平民
This man has shown willingness
to kill innocent people,

316
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,523
所以遭遇后的规则就很简单
so the rules of engagement are simple.

317
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:44,651
如果你碰到这个人，并且他威胁到你的生命
If you come across this man
and fear for your life

318
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:46,528
或者周围其他人的生命
or the lives of those nearby,

319
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:49,656
你就被授权可以使用任何武器进行攻击
you are authorized to
use deadly force on sight.

320
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:51,408
-包里是什么？ -James，现在别问
- What's in the bag?
- James, not now.

321
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,702
他的目标是数据中心，你难道不觉得奇怪吗？
It doesn't seem odd to you
that he'd target an archive?

322
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:55,286
这就像是在炸图书馆
It's like bombing a library.

323
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:57,038
Chris？有什么问题吗？
Chris? Everything okay there?

324
00:24:57,414 --> 00:25:00,083
是的，长官，Kirk先生
Yes, sir. Mr. Kirk is just acclimating

325
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,918
对他作为大幅的新职位有点不适应
to his new position as First Officer.

326
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:03,712
你有什么话要说，Kirk，那就说吧
You got something to say, Kirk, say it.

327
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:05,380
现在不说就没机会了
Tomorrow's too late.

328
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:08,550
我很好，先生，我道歉。
I'm fine, sir. My apologies.

329
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:11,553
说出来吧，孩子，别不好意思
Spit it out, son. Don't be shy.

330
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:14,848
为什么是数据中心？
Why the archive?

331
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:17,642
那所有的数据都是公开的记录
All that information is public record.

332
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:19,728
如果他真的想攻击舰队
If he really wanted to damage Starfleet,

333
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:23,523
这只会是一个开始
this could just be the beginning.

334
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,191
什么的开始，Kirk先生？
The beginning of what, Mr. Kirk?

335
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:28,111
先生，攻击事件发生后，按照委员会的程序
Sir, in the event
of an attack, protocol mandates

336
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:31,072
高级指挥官和舰长还有大幅都要到这里来
that senior command gather
captains and first officers

337
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:33,199
在星际舰队总部，就在这儿
at Starfleet H.Q., right here

338
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,578
-这间屋子里。-我很奇怪Harrison
- in this room.
- It is curious Harrison

339
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:38,705
会抢一艘没有跃迁能力的飞船...
would commandeer a jumpship
without warp capabilities...

340
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:46,004
离开这个房间
Clear the room!

341
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:52,385
不
No!

342
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:57,140
我们需要一支空中支援小队！Daystrom的会议室
We need an air defense team!
Daystrom Conference Room!


347
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:00,453
开火！
Fire!

348
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:23,698
你好？
Yeah?

349
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:26,326
长官，Scott先生发现了点东西
<i>Commander,
Mr. Scott has found something</i>

350
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:28,244
在Harrison的战舰残骸里
<i>in the wreckage of Harrison's ship.</i>

351
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:30,914
他叫我们马上去见他
<i>He has asked to see us right away.</i>

352
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:35,752
舰长！我在战舰残骸里发现了这个，先生。
Captain!
I found this in the crashed jumpship, sir.

353
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,629
-这就是那个混蛋逃跑的方法 -你什么意思？
- This is how the bastard got away.
- What do you mean?

354
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,839
这是个便携式传送装置
It's a portable
transwarp beaming device.

355
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:41,174
好吧，你能找出他传送到哪里了吗？
Well, can you figure out where he went?

356
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:44,177
我已经找到了先生，不过你不会喜欢这个地方的
I already did, sir.
And you're no gonna like it.

357
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,138
他去了一个我们...
He's gone to the one place we...

358
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,516
我们不能去的地方。
We just can't go.

359
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,978
将军，先生，他不在地球上。
Admiral, sir, he's not on Earth.

360
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:58,400
他在Kronos星球上，长官
He's on Kronos, sir.

361
00:30:58,483 --> 00:31:00,068
我申请恢复我的职位
I request my command be reinstated

362
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:02,028
并且请求允许我去追捕他
and your permission to go after him.

363
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,698
给我们几分钟
Give us a minute.

364
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:07,283
-Kronos - 是的长官
- Kronos.
- Yes, sir.

365
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,869
那么Harrison去了Klingon的老家去了
(Klingon:克林贡-掌握高科技的野蛮好战的外星种族)
So Harrison's gone to the Klingon homeworld.

366
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:11,621
-他叛逃了？-我们还不确定，长官
- Is he defecting?
- We're not sure, sir.

367
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:13,123
他在Ketha省避难
He has taken refuge
in the Ketha Province,

368
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:14,207
一片杳无人烟数十年的疆域
a region uninhabited for decades.

369
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,792
他肯定是在那里藏着，长官！
He's gotta be hiding there, sir!

370
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,585
他清楚如果我们接近Klingon的地盘
He knows if we even
go near Klingon space,

371
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:18,670
会引发战争的
it'd be all-out war.

372
00:31:18,753 --> 00:31:21,047
联邦舰队不能去那里抓他，但是我能
Starfleet can't go after him, but I can.

373
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:23,299
求您了，长官
Please, sir.

374
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:28,138
和Klingon人全面开展是不可避免的Kirk先生
All-out war with
the Klingons is inevitable, Mr. Kirk.

375
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:29,556
如果你问我的意见，那么战争已经开始了
If you ask me, it's already begun.

376
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:31,266
自从我们第一次发现他们的存在
Since we first learned of their existence,

377
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:33,476
Klingon帝国已经征服并且占领了
the Klingon Empire
has conquered and occupied

378
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,728
两个星球了，而且我们还证实
two planets that we know of

379
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,313
他们曾六次向我们的战舰开火
and fired on our ships
half a dozen times.

380
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:40,984
他们是冲我们来的
They are coming our way.

381
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:45,030
伦敦并不是目标
London was not an archive.

382
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:47,032
目标是联邦舰队的一个高级机密部门
It was a top-secret branch of Starfleet

383
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:49,617
称之为第31区
designated Section 31.

384
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:51,244
他们在那研究防御技术
They were developing
defense technology

385
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:53,246
训练我们的人去搜集情报
and training our officers
to gather intelligence

386
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:54,789
在Klingon人那里还有其他潜在的敌人那里
on the Klingons
and any other potential enemy

387
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:57,167
任何试图危害我们的人都包括在内
who means to do us harm.

388
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:58,710
Harrison曾经是我们的一个高级特工
Harrison was one of our top agents.

389
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:01,129
不过，现在他是一个逃犯而且我需要除掉他
Well, now he's a fugitive
and I want to take him out.

390
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:05,675
Pike总是说你是我们中最好的，最聪明的
Pike always said you were
one of our best and brightest.

391
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:08,553
你应该听听他为你辩护时所说的
You should have heard him defend you.

392
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:11,681
是他劝你加入舰队的，是吧？
He's the one who talked you
into joining Starfleet, wasn't he?

393
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:13,975
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

394
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:16,770
他是否提到过是谁劝他加入舰队的？
Did he ever tell you
who talked him into joining?

395
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:22,984
他的死我有责任
His death is on me.

396
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:25,653
还有你的
And yours can't be.

397
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:26,821
长官，求您了，我所...
Sir, please. All I...

398
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:28,406
Spock先生，你说的那个省
Mr. Spock, you said the province

399
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:29,949
Harrison藏的那个地方是杳无人烟的？
where Harrison is hiding is uninhabited?

400
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:31,618
十分确定，先生
Affirmative, sir.

401
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:36,539
作为我们战略性防御的一部分
As part of our defensive strategy,

402
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:38,875
31区开发了一种新型的光子鱼雷
31 developed a new photon torpedo.

403
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:42,962
射程远并且无法追踪
Long-range and untraceable,

404
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:45,173
Klingon的探测器无法探测出来
it would be invisible to Klingon sensors.

405
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:48,426
我不希望你受伤，不过我希望除掉他
I don't want you hurt,
but I want to take him out.

406
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,387
你停靠在中立地区的边缘
You park on the edge
of the Neutral Zone,

407
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,347
你锁定Harrison的藏身地
you lock onto Harrison's position,

408
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,848
发射，杀死他然后开溜
you fire, you kill him and you haul ass.

409
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:58,687
请求恢复Spock先生作为我大幅的职务
Permission to reinstate Mr. Spock as my First Officer.

410
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:01,356
批准
Granted.

411
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,115
Jim!

412
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:13,034
-你刚才在哪？ -干什么？
- Where were you?
- For what?

413
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:14,744
你的医疗检查
Your medical exam.

414
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:16,788
十个小时以前，你在一场该死的交火现场
Ten hours ago, you were
in a damn firefight.

415
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:19,124
-现在是我的责任，作为... -我没事，Bones
- Now it's my duty as ship's...
- I'm fine, Bones.

416
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:20,792
你TM有事
The hell you are.

417
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:24,295
我没事
I'm fine.

418
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:32,053
状态报告，Spock先生
Status report, Mr. Spock.

419
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:33,471
当我们到达的时候
The <i>Enterprise</i> should be
ready for launch

420
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:34,973
企业号应该准备好出发了
by the time we arrive.

421
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:37,350
-好的，不错 -舰长
- Good. Good.
- Captain.

422
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:40,687
谢谢你申请我的复职
Thank you for requesting
my reinstatement.

423
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:43,648
不用客气
You're welcome.

424
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:46,651
我再次作为你的大幅，现在是我的责任
As I am again
your First Officer, it is now my duty

425
00:33:46,776 --> 00:33:48,361
来强烈的反对关于我们这次任务的细节
to strongly object
to our mission parameters.

426
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:49,863
你肯定会反对
Of course it is.

427
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:51,406
舰队规定
There is no Starfleet regulation

428
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:53,033
不审判是不可以执行死刑的
that condemns a man
to die without a trial,

429
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:55,869
你和Marcus将军都忘记了
something you
and Admiral Marcus are forgetting.

430
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:58,204
而且，事先发射鱼雷
Also, preemptively firing torpedoes

431
00:33:58,288 --> 00:33:59,831
对着Klingon的老家，违反了...
at the Klingon homeworld
goes against...

432
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:01,666
是你自己说那片区域杳无人烟的
You yourself said
the area's uninhabited.

433
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:02,751
所以伤亡只会有一个
There's only gonna be one casualty.

434
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:04,377
并且万一你没听
And in case you weren't listening,

435
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:06,504
我们的命令跟联邦舰队规定一点关系都没有
our orders have nothing to do
with Starfleet regulation.

436
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:08,256
等等，我们要向Klingon人发射鱼雷？
Wait a minute. We're firing
torpedoes at the Klingons?

437
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:11,468
即使不谈规定，这个任务在道德上也是错的
Regulations aside,
this action is morally wrong.

438
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:14,304
不谈规定的话，把你从火山拉出来在道德上是对的
Regulations aside, pulling your ass
out of a volcano was morally right.

439
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:15,430
不过我在那上面没得到一点好处
And I didn't win any points for that.

440
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:16,598
喔，Jim，冷静
Whoa, Jim, calm down.

441
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:18,099
我是不会从一个机器人身上学什么道德规范的
I'm not gonna take
ethics lessons from a robot!

442
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:19,976
开始骂人证明你过于自我保护
Reverting to name-calling
suggests that you are defensive

443
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,394
也因此证明我的意见的有效性
and therefore find my opinion valid.

444
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:22,604
我并没征求你的意见
I wasn't asking for your opinion.

445
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:24,939
Bones，把那个东西从我脸上挪开
Bones, get that thing off my face.

446
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:27,734
舰长，我们的任务会引发一场和Klingon人的战争
Captain, our mission
could start a war with the Klingons

447
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:29,903
而且根据任务的定义，这是很不道德的
and it is, by its very definition, immoral.

448
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:31,571
或许你需要些必要的时间
Perhaps you should
take the requisite time

449
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:33,948
自己理出这个结论来
to arrive at this conclusion for yourself.

450
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:35,241
Kirk舰长
Captain Kirk.

451
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:38,036
科学官Wallace
Science Officer Wallace.

452
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,330
我被Marcus将军调到企业号
I've been assigned
to the <i>Enterprise</i> by Admiral Marcus.

453
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:42,374
这是我的调令
These are my transfer orders.

454
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:45,251
你申请了另外一个科学官，舰长？
You requested an additional
science officer, Captain?

455
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:46,419
我到是希望我申请了
I wish I had.

456
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:50,298
Carol Wallace上尉
"Lieutenant Carol Wallace."

457
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:51,758
应用物理学博士学位
"Doctorate in applied physics

458
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:54,803
专长是精密武器
"specializing in advanced weaponry."

459
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:55,929
简历令人印象深刻
Impressive credentials.

460
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:57,347
谢谢
Thank you.

461
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:58,932
看来我回到企业号上来是有点多余的
But redundant now that
I am back aboard the <i>Enterprise.</i>

462
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,517
不过，还是很高兴
And yet, the more the merrier.

463
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,644
-请坐，博士。-谢谢
- Have a seat, Doctor.
- Thank you.

464
00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:08,274
穿梭机乘客们，准备起飞。
Shuttle crew, stand by for lift-off.

465
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:31,381
不！我不签署任何东西！
No! I'm not signing anything!

466
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:33,675
现在，把这些讨厌的东西弄出我的飞船！舰长！
Now, get these bloody things
off my ship! Captain!

467
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:34,926
有问题吗，Scott先生？
Is there a problem, Mr. Scott?

468
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,970
是的长官。我正在跟这位先生解释
Aye, sir. I was just
explaining to this gentleman

469
00:35:37,053 --> 00:35:39,514
我不能授权任何东西上船
that I cannae authorize any
weapons on board this ship

470
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:40,724
除非知道他们里边装的是什么
without knowing what's inside them.

471
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:42,600
Scott先生引发了另外一个疑点...
Mr. Scott raises yet another point...

472
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:43,810
去船舷的报到
Report to the bridge.

473
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:45,145
舰长
Captain.

474
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:47,188
Scott先生，我明白你的顾虑
Mr. Scott, I understand your concerns,

475
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:49,149
但是我们需要这些鱼雷登船
but we need these torpedoes on board.

476
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:51,901
恕我直言，长官，光子鱼雷需要燃料
Due respect, sir,
but photon torpedoes run on fuel.

477
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:53,570
现在我在这却检测不出任何一种燃料
Now, I cannae detect the type of fuel

478
00:35:53,653 --> 00:35:55,447
在这些鱼雷的隔离燃料舱里
that's in the compartments
on these torpedoes

479
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,573
因为它被屏蔽了
because it's shielded.

480
00:35:56,656 --> 00:35:58,992
现在，我要求说明的时候，但是他却说...
Now, I asked for
the specifications, but he said...

481
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:01,077
-是机密， -是机密
- It's classified.
- It's classified.

482
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:03,246
所以我说，“没有说明，不给授权”
So I said, "No specs, no signature!"

483
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:04,330
舰长
Captain.

484
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:06,666
飞船检查完毕，我们随时可以出发了
Flight check's complete.
We're good to go, sir.

485
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:08,668
-谢谢，Sulu先生 -没问题长官
- Thank you, Mr. Sulu.
- Yes, sir.

486
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:11,838
抱歉失陪了长官，我还需要检查主跃迁核心
Now if you'll excuse me, sir,
I have a warp core to prime.

487
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:13,590
下去！
Get down!

488
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:15,258
Jim，你的主要器官状态很差
Jim, your vitals are way off.

489
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:17,677
去医疗舱报到，Scotty！
Report to the med bay. Scotty!

490
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:19,346
我需要你批准这些武器
I need you to approve those weapons.

491
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:20,430
你知道这些是什么吗，舰长
Do you know what this is, Captain?

492
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:21,931
我没有时间听你的教训，Scotty
I don't have time for a lecture, Scotty.

493
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:24,851
-你知道这是什么吗？ -是跃迁核心
- Do you know what this is?
- It's a warp core.

494
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:27,937
这是要发生放射性灾难的
It's a radioactive
catastrophe waiting to happen.

495
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:29,981
一个微小的磁力变化
A subtle shift in magnetic output

496
00:36:30,065 --> 00:36:32,942
比如说，发射一个或者多达七十二枚鱼雷
from, say, firing
one or more of six dozen torpedoes

497
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:34,486
而且鱼雷的爆炸当量还不清楚
with an unknown payload

498
00:36:34,694 --> 00:36:36,029
可能引发连锁反应，足够杀死
could set off a chain reaction
which would kill

499
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:37,781
船上所有的人
every living thing on this ship.

500
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:40,367
批准这些鱼雷装在上企业号，这是我忍耐的极限了
Letting those torpedoes on board the<i>
Enterprise</i> is the last straw!

501
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:42,327
-忍耐的起始线在哪？-什么是...
- What was the first straw?
- What was the...

502
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:44,245
忍耐有很多阶段
There are plenty of straws.

503
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:46,956
你觉得联邦舰队没收我的跃迁传送方程式？
How about Starfleet
confiscating my transwarp equation?

504
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,292
现在却有疯子用它来在银河系里乱窜！
And now some madman's
using it to hop across the galaxy!

505
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:50,460
你觉得那疯子是从哪得到的方程式？
Where do you think he got it from?

506
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:51,878
我们是有命令的，Scotty！
We have our orders, Scotty!

507
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:53,755
这才是我害怕的地方
That's what scares me.

508
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:56,549
这很明显是一次军事行动
This is clearly a military operation.

509
00:36:56,883 --> 00:36:58,426
我们现在参与军事行动了？
Is that what we are now?

510
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,594
因为我以为我们还是做探险的科学家
'Cause I thought we were explorers.

511
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:03,014
签署这些鱼雷，这是命令
Sign for the torpedoes, that's an order.

512
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:05,975
好的，好吧，你让我别无选择了
Right, well, you leave me no choice

513
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,352
只能开除我了
but to resign my duties.

514
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:08,937
拜托，Scotty
Come on, Scotty.

515
00:37:09,145 --> 00:37:10,689
你让我别无选择，长官。我绝对不会袖手旁观...
You're giving me no choice, sir.
I will not stand by...

516
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:11,898
你没给我更多的选择
You're not giving me much of a choice.

517
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:13,233
你可不可以破个例去签署...
Will you just
make an exception and sign...

518
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:14,609
你到底接受不接受我的离职申请？
Do you accept my resignation or not?

519
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:16,027
我接受
I do!

520
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:23,618
我接受
I do.

521
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,872
你被解职了，Scott先生
You are relieved, Mr. Scott.

522
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:43,304
Jim，看在上帝的份上，别使用那些鱼雷。
Jim, for the love of God,
do not use those torpedoes.

523
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:58,945
注意，跃迁核心反物质密闭检查
<i>Attention. Warp core
anti-matter containment check</i>

524
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:00,488
还有三分钟
<i>in three minutes.</i>

525
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:06,870
舰长！对于Pike将军的死我深表遗憾
<i>Captain! I'm so sorry
about Admiral Pike.</i>

526
00:38:07,245 --> 00:38:08,580
我们都是
We all are.

527
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:11,082
-你还好吧？ -很好，谢谢，上尉
- Are you okay?
- Fine, thank you, Lieutenant.

528
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:21,217
实际上，Scotty刚离职了
Actually, Scotty just quit.

529
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:26,264
而且你男朋友的总是乱猜测我
And your boyfriend's second-guessing
me every chance he gets.

530
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:31,019
我很抱歉，那是不合时宜的
I'm sorry, that was inappropriate.

531
00:38:31,102 --> 00:38:34,773
只是有时候我真恨不得把他的刘海从脑袋上扯下来
It's just sometimes
I want to rip the bangs off his head.

532
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:38,109
-你知道吗，也许因为我，我... -不是因为你
- You know, maybe it's me. I...
- It's not you.

533
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:40,904
不是？
It's not?

534
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:45,700
等等，你们...你们是不是吵架了？
Wait, are you guys...
Are you guys fighting?

535
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:46,785
我真的很不想谈论这件事，长官
I'd rather not talk about it, sir.

536
00:38:46,868 --> 00:38:48,953
哦我的天那！那会是什么样子？
Oh, my God! What is that even like?

537
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:55,835
你耳朵发烧没？
Your ears burning?

538
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:57,003
舰长到
Captain on the bridge!

539
00:38:57,545 --> 00:38:58,838
舰长
Captain.

540
00:38:59,547 --> 00:39:02,592
Chekov先生，你跟随Scott先生有些日子了
Mr. Chekov. You've been
shadowing Mr. Scott.

541
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:05,011
你对这艘船的电器系统很熟悉吧？
You are familiar with
the engineering systems of this ship?

542
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:06,096
是的，先生
Affirmative, sir.

543
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:07,222
好
Good.

544
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:11,017
你是新轮机长了。去换一件红色的外套
You're my new Chief.
Go put on a red shirt.

545
00:39:14,604 --> 00:39:16,106
遵命，舰长
Aye, Captain.

546
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:21,695
收回所有的泊船架Sulu先生
Retract all moorings, Mr. Sulu.

547
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:24,030
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

548
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:30,829
停靠卡一号，二号和三号已经松开
<i>Docking clamps one, two,
and three are released.</i>

549
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:31,871
所有泊船架已经收回
<i>All moorings retracted.</i>

550
00:39:43,174 --> 00:39:44,384
Uhura上尉，打开舰艇广播
Lieutenant Uhura,
open a shipwide channel.

551
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:45,468
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

552
00:39:46,177 --> 00:39:47,846
Chekov先生，下面怎么样？
<i>Mr. Chekov,
how we looking down there?</i>

553
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:50,390
-所有系统正常，长官 -收到
- All systems nominal, Captain.<i>
- Copy that.</i>

554
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:51,975
听您的命令随时启动跃迁
Warp available at your command.

555
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:53,643
谢谢，Chekov先生
<i>Thank you, Mr. Chekov.</i>

556
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:56,271
-好的，开始吧 -是的长官
- All right. Let's ride.
- Yes, sir.

557
00:40:09,576 --> 00:40:11,077
频道打开了，先生
Channel open, sir.

558
00:40:12,037 --> 00:40:14,414
请注意，企业号的所有船员们
Attention, crew of the <i>Enterprise.</i>

559
00:40:14,581 --> 00:40:16,708
你们大多都知道，Christopher Pike
As most of you know, Christopher Pike,

560
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,711
的前任舰长同时也是我们的挚友
former captain of this ship
and our friend,

561
00:40:21,379 --> 00:40:22,797
已经去世了
is dead.

562
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,508
凶手已经从我们的星球逃走了
The man who killed him
has fled our system

563
00:40:25,592 --> 00:40:27,344
他就藏在Klingon的老家
and is hiding on the Klingon homeworld,

564
00:40:27,552 --> 00:40:30,055
他认为我们不愿意去那里
<i>somewhere he believes
we are unwilling to go.</i>

565
00:40:31,473 --> 00:40:34,059
我们现在正要去那里
<i>We are on our way there now.</i>

566
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:38,063
Marcus将军提醒，我们绝对不能被发现
<i>Per Admiral Marcus, it is essential
that our presence go undetected.</i>

567
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:39,773
联邦和Klingon帝国之间
<i>Tensions between the Federation</i>

568
00:40:39,856 --> 00:40:41,566
的局势已经十分紧张
<i>and the Klingon Empire have been high.</i>

569
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:43,943
任何的刺激都会引发全面战争
<i>Any provocation could lead
to an all-out war.</i>

570
00:40:57,749 --> 00:40:59,709
我会亲自带领一个小队
I will personally lead a landing party

571
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:02,420
到一个Kronos星上被遗弃的城镇中
to an abandoned city
on the surface of Kronos

572
00:41:03,171 --> 00:41:06,424
在那里我们要抓住逃犯John Harrison
where we will capture
the fugitive, John Harrison,

573
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:10,595
并且把他押送回地球，接受审判
and return him to Earth
so he can face judgment for his actions.

574
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:16,810
好了，我们去抓住这个混蛋吧。Kirk完毕
All right. Let's go
get this son of a bitch. Kirk out.

575
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:24,609
舰长，我相信你做出了正确的决定
Captain, I believe you have
made the right decision.

576
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:25,652
如果我能帮忙的话
If I can be of assistance,

577
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,821
我会很高兴和你一起去这次任务
I would be happy to accompany
you on the away team.

578
00:41:29,614 --> 00:41:31,533
你？高兴？
You? Happy?

579
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,369
我只是试图用你的思维去传达一个观点
I was simply attempting to use your
vernacular to convey an idea.

580
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:38,289
谢谢，Spock先生
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

581
00:41:46,923 --> 00:41:51,011
所有船员，准备关闭弹药舱门
<i>All personnel, prepare for the
closing of payload bay doors.</i>

582
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,937
Spock先生，你吓了我一跳
Mr. Spock. You startled me.

583
00:42:01,938 --> 00:42:03,440
你在干什么，博士？
What are you doing, Doctor?

584
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:05,442
-确认一下鱼雷的内部... -你误解了
- Verifying that the torpedo's internal...
- You misunderstand.

585
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:07,610
你来这艘船为了什么？
What are you doing aboard this ship?

586
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:10,530
根本没有调你来企业号的记录
There is no record
of you being assigned to the <i>Enterprise.</i>

587
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:12,032
真的？那肯定是哪出错了
Really? That must be
some sort of mistake.

588
00:42:12,115 --> 00:42:14,409
我的推断能力很好，Marcus博士
My conclusion as well, Dr. Marcus.

589
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:17,996
除非你没告诉我们你的真实身份
Except that you have lied
about your identity.

590
00:42:18,204 --> 00:42:20,582
Wallace是你母亲的姓
Wallace is the surname of your mother.

591
00:42:20,665 --> 00:42:22,876
唯一的可能就是将军是你父亲
I can only assume
the Admiral is your father.

592
00:42:26,254 --> 00:42:27,589
Spock先生
Mr. Spock.

593
00:42:28,214 --> 00:42:30,717
我清楚我没有权利去要求你任何事情
I'm aware that I have
no right to ask this of you.

594
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:33,970
但是求你了，他不能知道我在这里...
But please, he cannot
know that I'm here...

595
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:43,897
机械系统自动的解除了跃迁状态，先生。
Engineering manually
dropped us out of warp, sir.

596
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,732
Chekov先生，是你把我的船给弄停了？
Mr. Chekov, did you break my ship?

597
00:42:45,815 --> 00:42:47,442
抱歉，长官。我不知道哪里出问题了！
Sorry, sir. I don't know what happened!

598
00:42:47,525 --> 00:42:48,651
核心过载了
The core overheated.

599
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:50,403
我不得不启动紧急制动装置
I had to activate the emergency stop.

600
00:42:50,487 --> 00:42:52,072
肯定是冷却剂渗漏了。我需要时间去检查
It must be a coolant leak.
I need time to find it.

601
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:54,407
-抱歉，长官 -该死
<i>- Sorry, Captain.</i>
- Damn it.

602
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:56,993
Sulu先生，距离目的地的时间有多少
Mr. Sulu, time to our destination.

603
00:42:57,243 --> 00:42:58,411
二十分钟，长官
Twenty minutes, sir.

604
00:42:58,495 --> 00:43:00,622
这是在敌人的地盘里的二十分钟，谁也指望不上
That's 20 minutes
in enemy space we weren't counting on.

605
00:43:00,705 --> 00:43:02,374
好吧，我们最好自己登陆
All right. We better hop to it.

606
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:03,917
-Spock在哪？ -这儿，舰长
- Where's Spock?
- Here, Captain.

607
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:06,002
你和我去Kronos
You're coming with me to Kronos.

608
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:07,087
上尉，你的Klingon语怎么样？
Lieutenant, how's your Klingon?

609
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:09,339
-很久没用了，不过没问题 -好的，你也一起去。
- It's rusty, but it's good.
- Good, you're coming, too.

610
00:43:10,715 --> 00:43:12,926
你们俩一起，这不会有什么问题吧？
This isn't going to be a problem, is it,
you two working together?

611
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:14,678
完全没问题
Absolutely not.

612
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:18,390
尚不明确
Unclear.

613
00:43:19,265 --> 00:43:20,600
我们穿梭机那里见
I'll meet you in the shuttle bay.

614
00:43:21,601 --> 00:43:23,978
Jim，你不是真的要到那里去吧？
Jim, you're not actually
going down there, are you?

615
00:43:24,104 --> 00:43:27,691
你不想抢劫了银行然后坐一辆瘪了胎的车逃跑吧
You don't rob a bank
when the getaway car has a flat tire.

616
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,402
等我们回来的时候
I'm sure engineering
will have us all patched up

617
00:43:30,443 --> 00:43:31,486
我确定工程师会修好轮胎的
by the time we get back.

618
00:43:31,695 --> 00:43:33,655
是这样吧，Chekov先生？
<i>Isn't that right, Mr. Chekov?</i>

619
00:43:33,738 --> 00:43:34,739
是的，舰长
Yes, Captain.

620
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:36,241
我会尽我的全力的，长官。
<i>I'll do my best, sir.</i>

621
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:39,619
Sulu先生，指挥权交给你
Mr. Sulu, you have the conn.

622
00:43:40,704 --> 00:43:42,372
我们一旦上路了
Once we're en route,
I want you to transmit

623
00:43:42,455 --> 00:43:44,708
我要你定向给Harrison的位置发话
a targeted comm burst
to Harrison's location.

624
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:47,335
你告诉他你有货真价实的鱼雷正瞄准他的脑袋
You tell him you have a bunch
of real big torpedoes pointed at his head

625
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:50,171
并且如果他不配合，你将不惜代价使用他们
and if he doesn't play nice,
you're not afraid to use them.

626
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,132
-有问题吗？ -没有，长官
- Is that a problem?
- No, sir.

627
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,050
我只是从来没坐过这个位置
I've just never sat in the chair before.

628
00:43:55,343 --> 00:43:56,845
你会做的很好的
You're gonna do great.

629
00:43:58,513 --> 00:44:00,015
Jim！等等！
Jim! Wait!

630
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,684
你刚把那个家伙扔到了一个高风险的牌局里边
You just sat that man down
at a high-stakes poker game

631
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:04,894
手里没有牌却要硬撑
with no cards and told him to bluff.

632
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,355
Sulu是不不错的家伙，但是他没做过舰长
Now Sulu's a good man,
but he is no captain.

633
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:08,690
接下来的两个小时里，他就是了
For the next two hours, he is.

634
00:44:08,773 --> 00:44:10,775
还有别总引用了，好吧？这是命令
And enough with the metaphors, all
right? That's an order.

635
00:44:10,942 --> 00:44:13,361
Sulu先生，保证 K'normian飞船准备起飞
Mr. Sulu, make sure that K'normian ship is ready to fly.

635
00:44:13,462 --> 00:44:16,361
(K'normian飞船:mubb事件征用的民用无武装小型飞船)

636
00:44:23,163 --> 00:44:25,457
连线Sulu舰长到穿梭机2号舱
Acting Captain Sulu to Shuttle Bay 2.

637
00:44:25,498 --> 00:44:28,375
请把上个月 Mudd事件 中征用的贸易船
<i>Please have the trade ship we confiscated</i>

638
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:30,003
加满燃料并且准备待命起飞
<i>during the Mudd incident last month fueled and flight ready.</i>

639
00:44:30,211 --> 00:44:32,213
Kirk船长正在去那里的路上
<i>Captain Kirk is en route to you now.</i>

637
00:44:32,498 --> 00:44:34,375
(mudd事件:请查询1996年版电视系列剧Mudd's Women)

640
00:44:35,633 --> 00:44:37,302
准备部署了，舰长
Ready to deploy, Captain.

641
00:44:37,385 --> 00:44:39,054
上尉，脱掉红衬衫
Lieutenants, lose the red shirts.

642
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:41,014
你现在是K'normian上的军火商，穿上这个
You are K'normian arms dealers.
Put those on.

643
00:44:41,681 --> 00:44:43,058
-长官？ -听着，如果这事有偏差
- Sir? - Look, if this thing goes south,

644
00:44:43,224 --> 00:44:45,185
我们不能和星际舰队有任何瓜葛
there can be nothing
tying us to Starfleet.

645
00:44:45,226 --> 00:44:47,729
除非你想挑起一场战争Hendorff先生
Unless of course you want to
start a war, Mr. Hendorff.

646
00:44:47,812 --> 00:44:50,190
-不想，先生 -不想，先生
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

647
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:51,483
很好，我也不想
Good. Me, neither.

648
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:12,087
我检测到在Kehta省只有一个生命迹象
I am detecting a single life sign in the Ketha Province.

649
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:14,255
根据Scott先生提供的信息
Given the information
provided by Mr. Scott,

650
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:15,590
这很可能就是John Harrison
this is most likely John Harrison.

651
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,384
Sulu先生，我想我们找到那个人了
Mr. Sulu, I think we found our man.

652
00:45:17,467 --> 00:45:18,718
你要让他知道你不是闹着玩的
You let him know you mean business.

653
00:45:18,802 --> 00:45:19,969
是的，长官
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

654
00:45:21,846 --> 00:45:23,848
请注意，hohn Harrison
Attention, John Harrison.

655
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:27,227
这里是联邦星舰企业号舰长Hikaru Sulu
This is Captain Hikaru Sulu
of the <i>U.S.S. Enterprise.</i>

656
00:45:28,061 --> 00:45:31,731
一群训练有素的军官正乘穿梭机到达你的位置
A shuttle of highly trained officers
is on its way to your location.

657
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:34,901
如果你不立即向他们缴械投降
<i>If you do not surrender
to them immediately,</i>

658
00:45:35,068 --> 00:45:39,239
我将会发射所有的高级远程鱼雷
<i>I will unleash the entire payload
of advanced long-range torpedoes</i>

659
00:45:39,322 --> 00:45:41,366
现在已经锁定你的位置
<i>currently locked onto your location.</i>

660
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:44,911
你有两分钟来决定是否投降
<i>You have two minutes
to confirm your compliance.</i>

661
00:45:45,036 --> 00:45:47,872
拒绝投降只有死路一条
<i>Refusal to do so will result
in your obliteration.</i>

662
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:53,378
如果你打算考验我，你会吃到苦头的
If you test me, you will fail.

663
00:45:57,716 --> 00:45:59,217
Sulu先生
Mr. Sulu,

664
00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:01,886
提醒我千万别惹恼你
remind me never to piss you off.

665
00:46:05,598 --> 00:46:06,850
KRONOS

666
00:46:06,933 --> 00:46:08,601
我们会在Harrison的位置降落
We will arrive at Harrison's location

667
00:46:08,685 --> 00:46:10,020
还有三分钟，舰长
in three minutes, Captain.

668
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,771
他很可能不会自愿投降
It is unlikely that he will come willingly.

669
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:15,650
我计算出他试图杀死我们的几率高达91.6%
I calculate the odds
of him attempting to kill us at 91.6 %.

670
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:16,901
太好了
Fantastic.

671
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,486
还好你不怕死
Good thing you don't care about dying.

672
00:46:20,488 --> 00:46:22,407
我很抱歉，上尉，我没听清你说的什么
I am sorry, Lieutenant.
I could not hear what you said.

673
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:24,034
我什么都没说
I didn't say anything.

674
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:26,953
实际想，我到很乐意说点什么
Actually, I'd be happy to speak

675
00:46:26,995 --> 00:46:27,996
-如果你愿意听我说的话 -你们俩...
- if you're willing to listen to me.
- Guys...

676
00:46:28,163 --> 00:46:29,748
上尉，我建议我们私下再谈这个问题
Lieutenant, I would prefer
to discuss this in private.

677
00:46:29,914 --> 00:46:31,207
你建议最好根本不谈这个问题
You'd prefer not to discuss this at all.

678
00:46:31,374 --> 00:46:32,375
我们现在的情况...
Our current circumstances...

679
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:33,835
你们真的要现在吵架吗？
Are you really gonna do this right now?

680
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,462
你事那么专注，从来没虑过...
What never seems to require
your undivided focus...

681
00:46:35,545 --> 00:46:37,005
我很抱歉，长官，就两分钟
I'm sorry, Captain, just two seconds.

682
00:46:37,213 --> 00:46:38,465
-好的。-...我们
- Okay.
- ...is us.

683
00:46:38,506 --> 00:46:40,800
在那火山里，你根本没想到我们
At that volcano, you didn't
give a thought to us.

684
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:43,386
如果你死了我怎么办，Spock
What it would do to me
if you died, Spock.

685
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:46,431
你一点感觉都没有
You didn't feel anything.

686
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:48,725
你根本不关心
You didn't care.

687
00:46:48,808 --> 00:46:51,644
而且我不是唯一对你失望的，舰长也是
And I'm not the only one who's upset
with you. The Captain is, too.

688
00:46:52,103 --> 00:46:54,356
不，不不，别把我扯进来
No, no, no. Don't drag me into this.

689
00:46:55,982 --> 00:46:57,150
她说的没错
She is right.

690
00:46:57,317 --> 00:47:00,362
你的意思是我不关心死亡是错的？
Your suggestion that
I do not care about dying is incorrect.

691
00:47:00,445 --> 00:47:02,113
一种生命体的最佳的机会
A sentient being's optimal chance

692
00:47:02,197 --> 00:47:04,324
去壮大，繁衍他们的生息
at maximizing their utility
is a long and prosperous life.

693
00:47:04,366 --> 00:47:05,367
太好了
Great.

694
00:47:05,575 --> 00:47:07,118
不像一首爱情歌曲
Not exactly a love song, Spock.

695
00:47:07,243 --> 00:47:08,286
你误解了
You misunderstand.

696
00:47:09,788 --> 00:47:11,831
在面对我生命即将终结的时候
It is true I chose not to feel anything

697
00:47:11,915 --> 00:47:14,793
我确实不想去感受
upon realizing that
my own life was ending.

698
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,170
当Pike将军临死的时候
As Admiral Pike was dying,

699
00:47:17,253 --> 00:47:19,130
我进入了他的意识
I joined with his consciousness

700
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:23,051
体会到了他临死前的感觉
and experienced what he felt
at the moment of his passing.

701
00:47:23,968 --> 00:47:26,304
愤怒，迷惑
Anger. Confusion.

702
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:27,806
孤独
Loneliness.

703
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,891
恐惧
Fear.

704
00:47:30,392 --> 00:47:33,311
我之前有过这种感觉
I had experienced those feelings before,

705
00:47:33,978 --> 00:47:35,397
比这要大无数倍
multiplied exponentially

706
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,149
是在我的星球被毁掉的那天
on the day my planet was destroyed.

707
00:47:39,984 --> 00:47:41,611
这样的感觉我宁可
Such a feeling is something I choose

708
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:43,822
不要在有了
never to experience again.

709
00:47:46,408 --> 00:47:49,828
Nyota，你误解了我不去感觉的原因
Nyota, you mistake my choice not to feel

710
00:47:50,161 --> 00:47:52,664
给人的印象是我平时少有同情心
as a reflection of my not caring.

711
00:47:53,498 --> 00:47:57,377
那么，我向你保证，事实恰恰相反
Well, I assure you,
the truth is precisely the opposite.

712
00:48:03,508 --> 00:48:04,676
那是什么鬼东西
What the hell was that?

713
00:48:05,427 --> 00:48:06,761
怎么了？他们的信号哪去了？
What happened? Where's their signal?

714
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:09,014
被切断了，我正努力把它们找出来
It cut out. I'm working to get them back.

715
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:15,395
我们正在被一艘D-4级Klingon飞船追击
We are being pursued by
a D-4 class Klingon vessel.

716
00:48:15,562 --> 00:48:16,563
我以为这个区已经被遗弃了呢！
I thought this sector was abandoned!

717
00:48:16,646 --> 00:48:17,814
一定是碰巧到这里的巡逻队
It must be a random patrol.

718
00:48:17,939 --> 00:48:18,940
抓紧了
Hold on!

719
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:24,237
这艘船没有攻击能力
This ship has no offensive capabilities.

720
00:48:24,279 --> 00:48:26,156
它抓到我们了，给我全部六格燃料
It's got us. Give me all six fuel cells.

721
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:27,240
好的，舰长
Aye, Captain.

722
00:48:41,671 --> 00:48:42,672
该死
Damn it!

723
00:48:44,507 --> 00:48:46,676
他们马上追上来，方位285！
They're closing fast, bearing 285!

724
00:48:49,346 --> 00:48:50,847
太好了，那里！那里！我们可以甩掉他们
All right, there! There!
We can lose them there.

725
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:54,225
如果你的意思是我们利用那个通道
If you are suggesting
that we utilize the passage

726
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:55,393
在两座建筑相邻的那里
between the approaching structures,

727
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,354
-这艘船通不过那里的 - 我们能通过
- this ship will not fit.
- We'll fit.

728
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,440
-舰长，我们通不过 -我们能通过，能通过！
- Captain, we will not fit.
- We'll fit, we'll fit!

729
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:20,960
-我告诉过你我们能通过 -我不确定这算通过
- I told you we'd fit.
- I am not sure that qualifies.

730
00:49:24,964 --> 00:49:26,049
能看到他们吗？
Any sign of them?

731
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:27,759
-看不到，正担心这个呢 -我们甩掉他们了
- No. Which worries me.
- We lost them!

732
00:49:27,926 --> 00:49:29,052
也许是他们正干扰我们扫描仪
Or they're jamming our scanners.

733
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:30,220
也许是我们甩掉他们了
Or we lost them.

734
00:49:48,196 --> 00:49:50,532
他们命令我们降落
They're ordering us to land.

735
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:54,327
舰长，他们肯定想知道我们为什么来这里
Captain, they're gonna
want to know why we're here.

736
00:49:54,869 --> 00:49:56,996
而且他们会折磨我们
And they're gonna torture us.

737
00:49:57,163 --> 00:49:58,748
拷问我们
Question us.

738
00:49:58,873 --> 00:50:00,375
最终会杀死我们
And they're gonna kill us.

739
00:50:02,544 --> 00:50:04,295
那么我们出去跟他们打
So we come out shooting.

740
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:10,468
我们人数，武器都差太远了
We're outnumbered, outgunned.

741
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:13,722
如果我们先开火，没有机会生还的
There's no way we survive
if we attack first.

742
00:50:14,806 --> 00:50:17,642
你把我带来，是因为我会说Klingon语
You brought me here
because I speak Klingon.

743
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:20,645
那么就让我去和他们说
Then let me speak Klingon.

744
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,403
这肯定行不通的
This isn't going to work.

745
00:51:10,445 --> 00:51:12,489
这是我们唯一合乎逻辑的选择
It is our only logical option.

746
00:51:12,655 --> 00:51:15,617
如果你阻止她，你不仅会惹恼Klingon人
And if you interrupt her now, you will
not only incur the wrath of the Klingons

747
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,286
肯定还会惹恼上尉Uhura
but that of Lieutenant Uhura as well.

748
00:51:30,465 --> 00:51:33,093
我是来帮你的
I AM HERE TO HELP YOU.

749
00:51:50,402 --> 00:51:52,070
-上尉。 -谢谢长官
- Lieutenant.
- Thanks, Captain.

750
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,955
接受我的敬意
WITH RESPECT.

751
00:52:02,997 --> 00:52:07,377
有一个逃犯藏在这一带
THERE IS A CRIMINAL HIDING IN THESE RUINS

752
00:52:08,086 --> 00:52:10,755
他杀死了我们很多人
HE HAS KILLED MANY OF OUR PEOPLE.

753
00:52:23,685 --> 00:52:27,230
我为什么要关心人类屠杀人类?
WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT
A HUMAN KILLING HUMANS?

754
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:30,984
因为你关心诚实
BECAUSE YOU CARE ABOUT HONOR.

755
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:35,155
然而这个人并不诚实
AND THIS MAN HAS NONE.

756
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:38,450
你和你的人民正处在危险之中
YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE ARE IN DANGER.

757
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:02,469
-别动 -有多少鱼雷？
- Stand down.
- How many torpedoes?

758
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:03,511
别动！
Stand down!

759
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:07,057
那些鱼雷，在你的信息里威胁我的那些武器
The torpedoes, the weapons you
threatened me with in your message.

760
00:55:07,223 --> 00:55:08,641
有多少？
How many are there?

761
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,561
七十二枚
Seventy-two.

762
00:55:18,526 --> 00:55:19,861
我投降
I surrender.

763
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:38,797
代表Christopher Pike
On behalf of Christopher Pike,

764
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:40,423
我的朋友
my friend,

765
00:55:41,299 --> 00:55:42,676
我接受你的投降
I accept your surrender.

766
00:56:07,492 --> 00:56:09,119
舰长
Captain!

767
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:18,753
舰长
Captain.

768
00:56:30,682 --> 00:56:32,017
把他铐起来
Cuff him.

769
00:56:51,911 --> 00:56:54,164
-Bones，来舰桥见我 -马上就到
- Bones, meet me in the brig.<i>
- Be right there.</i>

770
00:56:54,706 --> 00:56:55,707
上尉
Lieutenant.

771
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:59,627
联系星际舰队，通知他们我们监押了Harrison
Contact Starfleet, let them know
we have Harrison in custody,

772
00:57:00,211 --> 00:57:02,547
跃迁核心修复后我们就回去
and we'll be on our way once
the warp core is repaired.

773
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:03,923
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

774
00:57:20,398 --> 00:57:22,484
-他为什么会投降？ -我不知道
<i>- Why the hell did he surrender?
- I don't know.</i>

775
00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:24,486
他一个人就干掉了Klingon的一个分队
But he just took out a squad
of Klingons single-handedly.

776
00:57:24,569 --> 00:57:25,653
我想知道怎样办到的
I want to know how.

777
00:57:25,737 --> 00:57:28,114
听起来似乎我们船上有个超人
Sounds like we have
a superman on board.

778
00:57:28,198 --> 00:57:29,532
我也弄不明白
You tell me.

779
00:57:37,207 --> 00:57:39,959
把你的手穿过圆环，我要给你采集血样
Put your arm through the hole.
I'm gonna take a blood sample.

780
00:57:54,265 --> 00:57:57,268
我们为什么不动，舰长？
Why aren't we moving, Captain?

781
00:57:58,603 --> 00:58:01,648
一个意料之外的故障，也许是在你的跃迁核心
An unexpected malfunction,
perhaps in your warp core

782
00:58:01,815 --> 00:58:04,734
碰巧让你搁浅在Klingon边境上
conveniently stranding you
on the edge of Klingon space?

783
00:58:04,818 --> 00:58:07,070
-你怎么知道这些？-Bones
- How the hell do you know that?
- Bones.

784
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:11,241
我认为你已经注意到我宝贵的洞察力了，舰长
I think you'd find
my insight valuable, Captain.

785
00:58:13,618 --> 00:58:15,495
-我们没事吧？-没事
- We good?
- Yeah.

786
00:58:15,662 --> 00:58:17,163
告诉我你知道些什么
Let me know what you find.

787
00:58:17,914 --> 00:58:22,252
忽略我的话你会让你和你的所有船员丧命的
Ignore me and you
will get everyone on this ship killed.

788
00:58:28,758 --> 00:58:31,344
舰长，我相信他在试图迷惑你
Captain, I believe
he will only attempt to manipulate you.

789
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:33,722
我不建议我们对犯人进行进一步的接触
I would not recommend
engaging the prisoner further.

790
00:58:33,805 --> 00:58:35,306
给我几分钟
Give me a minute.

791
00:58:47,694 --> 00:58:50,030
让我解释一下现在的局势
Let me explain what's happening here.

792
00:58:50,363 --> 00:58:52,157
你是罪犯
You are a criminal.

793
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:54,826
我看见你谋杀了无辜的人
I watched you murder
innocent men and women.

794
00:58:54,909 --> 00:58:57,495
我被授权结果了你
I was authorized to end you!

795
00:58:57,871 --> 00:59:01,166
你仍然活着唯一的原因
And the only reason
why you are still alive

796
00:59:01,249 --> 00:59:02,876
是我让你活着
is because I am allowing it.

797
00:59:03,209 --> 00:59:05,879
所以闭上你的嘴
So shut your mouth.

798
00:59:06,379 --> 00:59:08,798
哦，舰长，你还要打我一顿吗？
Oh, Captain, are you going
to punch me again

799
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:11,801
一遍一遍的直到你的胳膊酸软？
over and over till your arm weakens?

800
00:59:11,885 --> 00:59:14,220
很显然你想，那么告诉我
Clearly you want to, so tell me,

801
00:59:15,305 --> 00:59:17,724
你为什么让我活着？
why did you allow me to live?

802
00:59:18,099 --> 00:59:19,142
我们都会犯错误
We all make mistakes.

803
00:59:19,351 --> 00:59:21,978
不，我向你投降，因为
No. I surrendered to you because,

804
00:59:22,062 --> 00:59:24,064
你的努力不禁让我相信
despite your attempt
to convince me otherwise,

805
00:59:24,147 --> 00:59:27,067
你似乎还是有良心的，Kirk先生
you seem to have
a conscience, Mr. Kirk.

806
00:59:28,568 --> 00:59:30,737
如果你没有，那么我肯定无法
If you did not,
then it would be impossible for me

807
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:32,906
通过事实来说服你
to convince you of the truth.

808
00:59:33,907 --> 00:59:38,745
23-17-46-11.

809
00:59:39,788 --> 00:59:42,123
坐标距离地球不远
Coordinates not far from Earth.

810
00:59:42,248 --> 00:59:45,669
如果你想知道我为什么做了那些事情
If you want to know why I did what I did,

811
00:59:45,752 --> 00:59:47,087
那么就去看看
go and take a look.

812
00:59:47,587 --> 00:59:50,173
给我一个相信你的理由
Give me one reason
why I should listen to you.

813
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,300
我可以给你72个
I can give you 72.

814
00:59:52,759 --> 00:59:55,428
而且他们就在你的船上，舰长
And they're on board your ship, Captain.

815
00:59:56,429 --> 00:59:59,057
他们一直在你的船上
They have been all along.

816
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:02,227
我建议你打开一个看看
I suggest you open one up.

817
01:00:18,785 --> 01:00:19,786
Hi!

818
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:30,171
不过你知道真正困扰我的是什么吗？
You know what really
bothers me, though?

819
01:00:30,255 --> 01:00:32,924
是鱼雷的改动，你知道的，就是那个增强系统
It's the modifications,
you know, the enhancements.

820
01:00:33,591 --> 01:00:36,011
对吧？就因为这个我被赶下船了
Right? And then like that,
I'm off the ship!

821
01:00:36,094 --> 01:00:38,263
就因为试图去做正确的事情
Just for trying to do what's right!

822
01:00:38,847 --> 01:00:40,432
换做你，你会怎么做？
And what did you do anyway?

823
01:00:40,557 --> 01:00:41,599
你就站在那里像一个哑巴一样
You just stood there like an oyster,

824
01:00:41,808 --> 01:00:43,018
看着我！
looking at me!

825
01:00:43,143 --> 01:00:44,144
谁？
What?

826
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:45,770
Scotty，我是Kirk
Scotty, it's Kirk.

827
01:00:45,937 --> 01:00:47,355
现在好哇！
Well now!

828
01:00:47,522 --> 01:00:50,483
这不是“发型不乱”的James舰长吗？
If it isn't Captain James
Tiberius Perfect Hair!

829
01:00:50,608 --> 01:00:52,402
你听见没有？我刚叫他“发型不乱”
<i>Did you hear that?
I called him Perfect Hair.</i>

830
01:00:52,527 --> 01:00:53,945
-你在哪？-你在哪？
- Where are you?<i>
- Where are you?</i>

831
01:00:54,029 --> 01:00:55,155
你是不是喝多了？
Are you drunk?

832
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:58,324
在我私人时间里做什么是我个人的事，小Jim
What I do in my private time
is my business, Jimbo.

833
01:00:58,450 --> 01:00:59,784
我有点事需要你帮忙
I need you to help me out
with something.

834
01:00:59,868 --> 01:01:01,202
你能记一下这组坐标吗？
Will you take these coordinates down?

835
01:01:01,286 --> 01:01:04,414
23-17-46-11.

836
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:06,041
你不写下来？
<i>Are you writing?</i>

837
01:01:06,124 --> 01:01:08,168
什么，你觉得我记不住四个数字？
What, you don't think
I can remember four numbers?

838
01:01:09,294 --> 01:01:12,339
对我一点信心都没有，第三个数字是什么来着？
Ye of little faith.
What was the third one?

839
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:14,507
46
<i>Forty-six.</i>

840
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:17,469
我不清楚这组数字的含义
I don't know exactly
what you're looking for,

841
01:01:18,303 --> 01:01:20,722
不过我感觉你查一下就会知道我们找的是什么
but I have a feeling you'll know it
when you see it.

842
01:01:21,473 --> 01:01:23,600
对于那些鱼雷的看法，你也许是对的
You may have been right
about those torpedoes.

843
01:01:25,477 --> 01:01:27,729
我会把这看作是一次道歉
I will consider that an apology.

844
01:01:27,812 --> 01:01:29,606
而且我会考虑这次道歉的
And I will consider that apology.

845
01:01:30,899 --> 01:01:32,192
是你要退出的
You are the one who quit.

846
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,027
你把我免职了
You made me quit!

847
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:35,945
Scott先生？
Mr. Scott?

848
01:01:36,654 --> 01:01:37,697
Scott.

849
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:40,742
那个神经兮兮的家伙
The nerve of that guy!

850
01:01:42,202 --> 01:01:45,246
我不会帮那个家伙任何事情了！
I am not doing that man any favors!

851
01:01:45,413 --> 01:01:46,581
不会
No!

852
01:01:47,499 --> 01:01:48,750
好吧，算啦！
All right, then!

853
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:50,877
你那榆木脑袋是不是有问题了？
Are you out of your corn-fed mind?

854
01:01:51,044 --> 01:01:52,796
你不会是真的相信这个家伙吧？
You're not actually going
to listen to this guy?

855
01:01:52,879 --> 01:01:54,798
他杀了Pike，他差点杀了你
He killed Pike, he almost killed you,

856
01:01:54,881 --> 01:01:57,133
现在你居然认为打开一枚鱼雷是个好主意
and now you think
it's a good idea to pop open a torpedo

857
01:01:57,217 --> 01:01:58,385
因为他激你这么做
because he dared you to.

858
01:01:58,468 --> 01:02:00,303
为什么他救我们，Bones？
Why did he save our lives, Bones?

859
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:02,055
医生确实有他的道理，舰长。
The Doctor does have a point, Captain.

860
01:02:02,138 --> 01:02:04,557
别同意我的意见，Spock。那让我很不舒服
Don't agree with me, Spock.
It makes me very uncomfortable.

861
01:02:04,641 --> 01:02:07,560
也许你也是，应该控制你的情绪，医生
Perhaps you, too, should learn
to govern your emotions, Doctor.

862
01:02:07,644 --> 01:02:08,937
这种情况下，逻辑会指使...
In this situation, logic dictates...

863
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:11,064
逻辑？我的天哪！这儿有个疯子
Logic? Oh, my God! There's a maniac

864
01:02:11,147 --> 01:02:12,816
试图让我们炸掉我们自己的船...
trying to make us blow up
our own damn ship and...

865
01:02:12,899 --> 01:02:14,651
而且我都不知道他为什么要投降
That's not it.
I don't know why he surrendered,

866
01:02:14,734 --> 01:02:16,152
问题不仅于此
but that's not it.

867
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:18,571
好吧，我们要打开一枚鱼雷，问题是怎么打开
Look, we're gonna open a torpedo.
The question is how.

868
01:02:18,655 --> 01:02:20,240
Jim如果Scott先生不在船上
But, Jim, without Mr. Scott on board,

869
01:02:20,323 --> 01:02:21,741
谁有这个能力
who exactly is qualified

870
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:24,035
去拆开一个四吨重的雷管？
to just pop open
a four-ton stick of dynamite?

871
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:25,745
将军的女儿似乎对鱼雷很感兴趣
The Admiral's daughter
appeared to have interest

872
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:27,831
而且她是武器专家
in the torpedoes
and she is a weapons specialist.

873
01:02:28,415 --> 01:02:30,375
也许她能帮上忙
Perhaps she could be of some use.

874
01:02:30,583 --> 01:02:32,210
什么将军的女儿？
What Admiral's daughter?

875
01:02:32,377 --> 01:02:34,754
Carol Marcus 你的新科学官
Carol Marcus. Your new science officer

876
01:02:34,796 --> 01:02:36,631
隐藏了她真实的身份登船的
concealed her identity to board the ship.

877
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:39,217
你准备什么时候告诉我这些？
When were you going to tell me that?

878
01:02:39,384 --> 01:02:41,428
当合适的时候，就像刚才那个时候
When it became relevant. As it just did.

879
01:02:41,594 --> 01:02:43,138
那些鱼雷在武器舱里吗？
Are the torpedoes in the weapons bay?

880
01:02:43,221 --> 01:02:44,764
装载好了随时准备发射。它们到底是什么？
Loaded and ready to fire.
What are they?

881
01:02:45,015 --> 01:02:46,349
我不知道，这也正是我伪造了调令
I don't know. That's
why I forged my transfer

882
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:47,726
来到您的船上来查他们的原因
onto your ship to find out why.

883
01:02:47,767 --> 01:02:49,519
我为此道歉
I do apologize for that.

884
01:02:49,602 --> 01:02:52,397
还有，如果我给你惹来什么麻烦，我很抱歉
By the way, if I caused you
any problems, I am sorry.

885
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:53,898
我是Carol Marcus
I'm Carol Marcus.

886
01:02:54,065 --> 01:02:56,067
-James Kirk -鱼雷
- James Kirk.
- Torpedoes.

887
01:02:56,943 --> 01:02:59,112
我父亲把他监督下的所有项目的权限都给了我
My father gave me access
to every program he oversaw,

888
01:02:59,195 --> 01:03:01,865
当我听说他弄这些鱼雷的原型的时候
then I heard he was
developing these prototype torpedoes.

889
01:03:01,948 --> 01:03:05,535
我去和他面谈，他甚至不见我。
When I went to confront him about it,
he wouldn't even see me.

890
01:03:05,618 --> 01:03:07,746
自那时起，我发现这些鱼雷
That's when I discovered
the torpedoes had disappeared

891
01:03:07,787 --> 01:03:09,956
从所有官方记录中消失了
from all official records.

892
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:11,958
之后他把鱼雷给了我
And then he gave them to me.

893
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:15,045
Kirk舰长，你比你的名声体现出来的要聪明的多
You're much cleverer than
your reputation suggests, Captain Kirk.

894
01:03:15,295 --> 01:03:16,796
我还有名声？
I have a reputation?

895
01:03:16,921 --> 01:03:19,049
是的，你有，我是Christine Chapel的朋友
Yes, you do. I'm a friend
of Christine Chapel's.

896
01:03:19,632 --> 01:03:21,051
Christine，没错，她怎么样？
Christine, yes. How is she?

897
01:03:21,134 --> 01:03:23,136
她调到另外一个星系去当了一名护士
She transferred to the
outer frontier to be a nurse.

898
01:03:23,261 --> 01:03:24,304
她现在比之前快乐多了
She's much happier now.

899
01:03:24,387 --> 01:03:25,388
那不错
That's good.

900
01:03:25,638 --> 01:03:27,891
你根本不知道我说的是谁，是吧？
You have no idea
who I'm talking about, do you?

901
01:03:28,808 --> 01:03:29,809
我们来这儿干什么？
What are we doing in here?

902
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:30,894
穿梭机准备好起飞了吗？
Is this shuttle prepped to fly?

903
01:03:30,977 --> 01:03:32,312
当然准备好了
Of course it is.

904
01:03:32,395 --> 01:03:34,022
-你能转过身去吗？-为什么？
- Would you please turn around?
- Why?

905
01:03:34,981 --> 01:03:36,483
转过身就行了
Just turn around.

906
01:03:37,567 --> 01:03:39,569
在企业号上试图拆鱼雷
It's too dangerous to try and open

907
01:03:39,652 --> 01:03:41,571
实在是太危险了
one of these torpedoes
on the <i>Enterprise.</i>

908
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:44,407
不过附近有一个小行星
But there is a nearby planetoid.

909
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:46,034
我可以在那里拆开一个
I can open one up there.

910
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:48,119
不过我需要一些帮助
But I will need some help.

911
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:49,996
转过去
Turn around.

912
01:03:51,081 --> 01:03:52,332
马上
Now!

913
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:55,335
舰长到
Captain on the bridge!

914
01:03:55,585 --> 01:03:57,003
Sulu先生
Mr. Sulu,

915
01:03:57,128 --> 01:03:59,589
Marcus博士和Mccoy在那个小行星上着陆了吗？
have Doctors Marcus and McCoy
landed on the planetoid yet?

916
01:03:59,673 --> 01:04:02,342
是的，长官，他们正把鱼雷运送到上边
Yes, sir. They're moving the
torpedo into position now.

917
01:04:02,676 --> 01:04:04,678
好的。Klingon人那边有什么消息没有？
Good. Any activity from the Klingons?

918
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:06,012
目前还没有
Not yet.

919
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:08,098
不过如果我们在这世间场了，他们会发现我们的
But if we're stuck
here much longer, they will find us.

920
01:04:09,099 --> 01:04:10,809
Uhura上尉，你通知星际舰队
Lieutenant Uhura,
did you let Starfleet know

921
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:12,435
我们监押了Harrison吗 ？
we have Harrison in custody?

922
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:14,521
通知了，长官，目前还没与回应
Yes, sir. No response yet.

923
01:04:15,522 --> 01:04:17,273
轮机室来电
<i>Engineering to bridge.</i>

924
01:04:17,357 --> 01:04:19,567
Hello，舰长，你能听到我说话吗？
<i>Hello. Captain, can you hear me?</i>

925
01:04:19,693 --> 01:04:21,444
Chekov先生，给我点好消息
Mr. Chekov, give me some good news.

926
01:04:21,778 --> 01:04:25,031
我们找到泄漏点了，长官，不过损坏很严重
We found the leak, sir,
but the damage is substantial.

927
01:04:25,115 --> 01:04:26,116
我们正在抢修
We're working on it.

928
01:04:26,282 --> 01:04:27,951
知道是什么导致的吗？
<i>Any idea what caused it?</i>

929
01:04:28,618 --> 01:04:32,205
不知道，长官，但是我可以承担所有责任
No, sir. But I accept full responsibility.

930
01:04:33,707 --> 01:04:37,544
某些事告诉我这不是你的错，继续维修吧
Something tells me
it wasn't your fault. Stay on it.

931
01:04:37,794 --> 01:04:39,713
穿梭机已经待命，舰长
Shuttle is standing by, Captain.

932
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,173
Bones，谢谢你的帮忙
Bones, thanks for helping out.

933
01:04:42,215 --> 01:04:44,426
Marcus博士要找船上手最稳的人
Dr. Marcus asked
for the steadiest hands on the ship.

934
01:04:44,592 --> 01:04:46,052
你知道吗，当我梦到被困在
You know, when I dreamt
about being stuck

935
01:04:46,136 --> 01:04:48,179
一个鸟不生蛋的沙漠星球上，和一个美女的时候
on a deserted planet
with a gorgeous woman,

936
01:04:48,221 --> 01:04:49,639
是没有鱼雷的
there was no torpedo!

937
01:04:49,723 --> 01:04:52,392
McCoy医生，我可以提醒一下叫你来不是为了调情的
<i>Dr. McCoy, may I remind you,
you are not there to flirt.</i>

938
01:04:52,475 --> 01:04:55,020
那样的话这双传说中的手怎么帮助你呢Marcus博士？
So how can these legendary
hands help you, Dr. Marcus?

939
01:04:55,103 --> 01:04:56,187
<i>Bones!</i>

940
01:04:56,229 --> 01:04:58,148
要想了解这些鱼雷有多大威力
To understand how
powerful these weapons are,

941
01:04:58,231 --> 01:04:59,315
我们需要打开弹头
we need to open the warhead.

942
01:04:59,399 --> 01:05:01,026
要打开弹头，我们得进入燃料舱
To do that, we need to
access the fuel compartment.

943
01:05:01,067 --> 01:05:02,110
很不幸
Unfortunately for us,

944
01:05:02,193 --> 01:05:04,738
这些武器的弹头是激活的
the warheads on these
weapons are live.

945
01:05:04,904 --> 01:05:05,905
甜心，我曾经做过一个
Sweetheart, I once performed

946
01:05:05,947 --> 01:05:08,366
紧急的刨妇产手术，是一个怀孕的Gorn人
(Gorn:葛恩人-具有爬虫类特征的直立生物)
an emergency C-section on a pregnant Gorn.

947
01:05:08,408 --> 01:05:09,409
八胞胎
Octuplets.

948
01:05:09,534 --> 01:05:11,703
而且我不得不告诉你，那些小杂种咬人
And let me tell you,
those little bastards bite.

949
01:05:11,828 --> 01:05:14,497
我觉得我可以给你的导弹施些魔法
I think I can work
some magic on your missile.

950
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:17,459
McCoy医生，那有一束光纤的线缆
Dr. McCoy,
there's a bundle of fiber optic cables

951
01:05:17,542 --> 01:05:18,960
就对着内壳
against the inner casing.

952
01:05:19,044 --> 01:05:21,004
你需要剪断第二十三根
You'll need to cut the 23rd wire down.

953
01:05:21,087 --> 01:05:22,756
干什么都行，别碰其他任何东西
Whatever you do,
do not touch anything else.

954
01:05:22,881 --> 01:05:23,882
你明白吗？
Do you understand?

955
01:05:23,923 --> 01:05:25,884
明白，从来没有过任何想法
Right. The thought
never crossed my mind.

956
01:05:26,092 --> 01:05:27,177
McCoy医生
Dr. McCoy,

957
01:05:27,302 --> 01:05:29,262
听我的口令
<i>wait for my word.</i>

958
01:05:29,429 --> 01:05:31,264
我正在给引爆处理器改线
<i>I'm rerouting the detonation processor.</i>

959
01:05:31,431 --> 01:05:33,433
-你准备好了吗？ -迫不及待
- Are you ready?
- And raring.

960
01:05:33,558 --> 01:05:34,559
好运
Good luck.

961
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,395
长官，鱼雷自己激活了
Sir, the torpedo just armed itself.

962
01:05:37,437 --> 01:05:38,980
弹头将在30秒后爆炸，长官！
The warhead's gonna
detonate in 30 seconds, sir!

963
01:05:39,064 --> 01:05:41,399
发生什么了？我的胳膊拿不出来了！
What the hell happened?
I can't get my arm out!

964
01:05:41,733 --> 01:05:43,068
锁定他们，把他们传送回来，马上
Target their signal.
Beam them back right now.

965
01:05:43,276 --> 01:05:46,946
传送器无法分辨McCoy和鱼雷
The transporter cannot differentiate
between Dr. McCoy and the torpedo.

966
01:05:47,072 --> 01:05:48,782
我们不能把其中的一个单独传送回来
We cannot beam back one
without the other.

967
01:05:48,865 --> 01:05:50,492
Marcus博士，你能拆除它吗？
Dr. Marcus, can you disarm it?

968
01:05:50,575 --> 01:05:52,786
我正在努力，我正在努力
I'm trying. I'm trying.

969
01:05:53,328 --> 01:05:54,371
Jim，把她传送回去！
Jim, get her the hell out of here!

970
01:05:54,454 --> 01:05:56,122
不！如果你把我传送回去，他会死的！
No! If you beam me back, he dies!

971
01:05:56,247 --> 01:05:57,665
让我做我该做的就行了
<i>Just let me do it!</i>

972
01:05:58,083 --> 01:05:59,751
10，9
Ten. Nine.

973
01:05:59,918 --> 01:06:00,919
8
Eight.

974
01:06:01,127 --> 01:06:03,588
听候您的命令准备传送Marcus博士，舰长
Standing by to transport
Dr. Marcus on your command, sir.

975
01:06:04,464 --> 01:06:05,465
4，3
Four. Three.

976
01:06:05,674 --> 01:06:06,716
该死
Shit!

977
01:06:12,514 --> 01:06:14,808
成功拆除，舰长
Deactivation successful, Captain.

978
01:06:16,142 --> 01:06:17,644
McCoy医生，你还好吗？
Dr. McCoy, are you all right?

979
01:06:22,982 --> 01:06:24,234
<i>Bones!</i>

980
01:06:25,318 --> 01:06:26,486
Jim?

981
01:06:27,404 --> 01:06:29,572
你一定得来看看这个
You're going to want to see this.

982
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:42,627
COORDINATES 23.17.46.11
JUPITER

983
01:07:35,138 --> 01:07:38,475
第二小队，把你们的推进器交付到12号码头
Delta team, deliver your<i>
thrusters to loading dock 12.</i>

984
01:07:39,392 --> 01:07:41,144
联邦星舰复仇者号，舰桥人员
U.S.S. Vengeance, <i>bridge crew</i>

985
01:07:41,227 --> 01:07:43,563
请求进入结构舱
<i>requesting entry to construction hangar.</i>

986
01:07:46,024 --> 01:07:47,233
允许进入结构舱
<i>You are cleared to enter the hangar.</i>

987
01:07:56,242 --> 01:07:59,746
我需要焊接小队去一号引擎舱
<i>I need a welding team
on the number one nacelle.</i>

988
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:04,584
该死...
Holy...

989
01:08:06,586 --> 01:08:07,587
我们弄到什么了？
What have we got?

990
01:08:07,712 --> 01:08:08,713
实际上这相当的高明
It's quite clever actually.

991
01:08:08,755 --> 01:08:10,924
这个鱼雷的燃料舱被拆除了
This fuel container's been
removed from the torpedo

992
01:08:11,007 --> 01:08:13,677
然后把冷藏柜改装藏进里面
and retrofitted to hide this cryo tube.

993
01:08:15,512 --> 01:08:17,097
-他还活着吗？-还活着
- Is he alive?
- He's alive.

994
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:19,391
不过如果我们尝试唤醒他
But if we try to revive him

995
01:08:19,599 --> 01:08:21,893
如果频率不对，很有可能杀死他
without the proper sequencing,
it could kill him.

996
01:08:21,935 --> 01:08:23,770
这种技术已经超越我的能力范围了
This technology's beyond me.

997
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:25,397
有多先进，医生？
How advanced, Doctor?

998
01:08:25,605 --> 01:08:28,024
并不是先进，这个冷藏柜是远古时期的
It's not advanced.
That cryo tube is ancient.

999
01:08:28,692 --> 01:08:31,611
自从我们发明了跃迁技术以后我们就不用速冻技术了
We haven't needed to freeze anyone
since we developed warp capability,

1000
01:08:31,695 --> 01:08:35,031
这也正说明了我们这些朋友有多有趣
which explains the most interesting
thing about our friend here.

1001
01:08:36,032 --> 01:08:37,367
他得有300岁了
He's 300 years old.

1002
01:08:46,251 --> 01:08:48,044
为什么鱼雷里边有人？
Why is there a man in that torpedo?

1003
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:50,422
有男人有女人
There are men and women

1004
01:08:50,463 --> 01:08:52,298
他们都在那些鱼雷里边，舰长
in all those torpedoes, Captain.

1005
01:08:52,382 --> 01:08:54,092
我把他们放在那里边
I put them there.

1006
01:08:57,262 --> 01:08:58,346
你到底是谁？
Who the hell are you?

1007
01:09:02,434 --> 01:09:05,103
是很久以前的一个幸存者
A remnant of a time long past.

1008
01:09:06,271 --> 01:09:08,231
基因改造为了让我们更强大
Genetically engineered to be superior

1009
01:09:08,314 --> 01:09:11,276
以便领导其他人维护世界的和平
so as to lead others
to peace in a world at war.

1010
01:09:12,444 --> 01:09:17,449
但是我们被指责有罪，被迫放逐
But we were condemned as
criminals, forced into exile.

1011
01:09:18,658 --> 01:09:20,493
我们沉睡了几个世纪
For centuries we slept,

1012
01:09:21,619 --> 01:09:25,290
希望我们醒来的时候，会有所改变
hoping when we awoke,
things would be different.

1013
01:09:25,665 --> 01:09:27,834
但是因为导致了Vulcan的毁灭
(Vulcan:瓦肯-Spock的故乡)
But as a result of the destruction of Vulcan,

1014
01:09:28,126 --> 01:09:30,295
你们的星际舰队就开始在
your Starfleet began
to aggressively search

1015
01:09:30,337 --> 01:09:31,629
不同象限中大肆搜捕
distant quadrants of space.

1016
01:09:31,671 --> 01:09:34,466
漂流在太空中的船被发现了，只有我一个人幸存了下来
My ship was found adrift.
I alone was revived.

1017
01:09:34,507 --> 01:09:36,301
我查了一下“John Harrison”
I looked up "John Harrison."

1018
01:09:36,509 --> 01:09:37,844
他并不存在，直到一年以前
Until a year ago, he didn't exist.

1019
01:09:37,927 --> 01:09:41,473
他们在我苏醒的时候伪造了John Harrison这个身份
John Harrison was a fiction
created the moment I was awoken

1020
01:09:41,514 --> 01:09:44,768
你们的Marcus将军利用这个身份来促进他的事业
by your Admiral Marcus
to help him advance his cause.

1021
01:09:45,018 --> 01:09:48,438
用这个幌子来掩饰我的真实身份
A smokescreen
to conceal my true identity.

1022
01:09:49,647 --> 01:09:51,691
我的名字是
My name is

1023
01:09:51,775 --> 01:09:53,193
Khan.

1024
01:09:58,114 --> 01:10:00,784
为什么星际舰队的将军
Why would a Starfleet Admiral

1025
01:10:01,117 --> 01:10:04,746
要一个300岁的冰人的帮助
ask a 300-year-old frozen man for help?

1026
01:10:04,913 --> 01:10:07,540
因为我更强
Because I am better.

1027
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:10,126
-哪方面？ -任何方面
- At what?
- Everything.

1028
01:10:11,628 --> 01:10:13,630
Alexander Marcus需要
Alexander Marcus needed to respond to

1029
01:10:13,713 --> 01:10:15,799
在民主的社会里应对非民主的威胁
an uncivilized threat in a civilized time

1030
01:10:15,882 --> 01:10:18,301
因为这，他需要一个精通军事的大脑
and for that he needed a warrior's mind.

1031
01:10:18,385 --> 01:10:19,552
我的大脑
My mind.

1032
01:10:19,886 --> 01:10:21,971
来建造武器和战舰
To design weapons and warships.

1033
01:10:22,138 --> 01:10:24,057
你是说将军
You are suggesting the Admiral

1034
01:10:24,224 --> 01:10:26,101
违反了他发誓信守的所有原则
violated every regulation
he vowed to uphold

1035
01:10:26,184 --> 01:10:28,228
就是想开发你的天份
simply because he wanted
to exploit your intellect.

1036
01:10:28,436 --> 01:10:30,772
他想开发的是我的野性
He wanted to exploit my savagery.

1037
01:10:30,897 --> 01:10:33,566
只有天份在战斗中是没用的Spock先生
Intellect alone is useless
in a fight, Mr. Spock.

1038
01:10:33,692 --> 01:10:35,443
你...你甚至连规则都不能打破
You... You can't even break a rule.

1039
01:10:35,527 --> 01:10:38,321
怎么指望你打断别人的骨头？
How would you be
expected to break bone?

1040
01:10:39,155 --> 01:10:41,783
Marcus利用我来设计武器
Marcus used me to design weapons.

1041
01:10:41,991 --> 01:10:44,744
来帮助他实现他军事化星际舰队的理想
To help him realize
his vision of a militarized Starfleet.

1042
01:10:44,911 --> 01:10:47,580
他派你来使用这些武器
He sent you to use those weapons.

1043
01:10:48,039 --> 01:10:52,043
向一个不明星球发射我的鱼雷
To fire my torpedoes
on an unsuspecting planet.

1044
01:10:52,711 --> 01:10:55,422
然后故意弄坏了你的船
And then he purposely
crippled your ship

1045
01:10:55,588 --> 01:10:59,426
在敌人的地盘，只能导致一个必然的结果
in enemy space,
leading to one inevitable outcome.

1046
01:10:59,551 --> 01:11:01,094
Klingon人会来搜查
The Klingons would come searching

1047
01:11:01,219 --> 01:11:03,054
而引起这一切的人
for whomever was responsible,

1048
01:11:03,096 --> 01:11:05,265
也就是你，根本没机会逃跑
and you would have
no chance of escape.

1049
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:09,811
Marcus最后将会得到他谈到的战争
Marcus would finally
have the war he talked about.

1050
01:11:09,894 --> 01:11:11,938
他梦寐以求的战争
The war he always wanted.

1051
01:11:12,063 --> 01:11:13,732
不，不
No. No.

1052
01:11:14,733 --> 01:11:15,859
我亲眼看见你向
I watched you open fire

1053
01:11:16,026 --> 01:11:18,570
没有武装的星际舰队官员开火
in a room full of
unarmed Starfleet officers.

1054
01:11:18,778 --> 01:11:20,572
你没有一丝怜悯的杀了他们
You killed them in cold blood!

1055
01:11:20,613 --> 01:11:23,116
Marcus夺走了我的船员
Marcus took my crew from me.

1056
01:11:23,283 --> 01:11:25,368
你是个凶手！
You are a murderer!

1057
01:11:25,535 --> 01:11:29,039
他利用我的朋友来控制我
He used my friends to control me.

1058
01:11:32,417 --> 01:11:35,086
我试着把他们偷运到安全的地方
I tried to smuggle them to safety

1059
01:11:35,128 --> 01:11:36,880
通过把他们隐藏在武器中
by concealing them in the very weapons

1060
01:11:36,963 --> 01:11:38,631
我设计的武器
I had designed,

1061
01:11:40,425 --> 01:11:42,427
但是我被发现了
but I was discovered.

1062
01:11:43,762 --> 01:11:47,432
我没有办法，只能一个人逃离了
I had no choice but to escape alone.

1063
01:11:48,933 --> 01:11:53,104
当我逃出来之后，我有充分的理由相信
And when I did,
I had every reason to suspect

1064
01:11:53,146 --> 01:11:57,484
Marcus已经杀死了每一个
that Marcus had killed every single one

1065
01:11:57,567 --> 01:12:00,987
我最亲爱的人
of the people I hold most dear.

1066
01:12:05,116 --> 01:12:07,827
所以我以牙还牙
So I responded in kind.

1067
01:12:11,623 --> 01:12:12,957
我的船员
My crew

1068
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:15,960
就是我的家人，Kirk
is my family, Kirk.

1069
01:12:16,169 --> 01:12:20,173
你难道不会为你的家人做任何事情吗？
Is there anything
you would not do for your family?

1070
01:12:22,258 --> 01:12:23,468
接近警报，长官！
<i>Proximity alert, sir!</i>

1071
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:25,303
有一艘船冲着我们跃迁过来了
<i>There's a ship at warp
heading right for us.</i>

1072
01:12:25,345 --> 01:12:27,347
-Klingon人？-跃迁？
- Klingons?
- At warp?

1073
01:12:27,472 --> 01:12:28,807
不，Kirk
No, Kirk.

1074
01:12:28,848 --> 01:12:31,017
-你我都知道那是谁 -我不这么认为
- We both know who it is.<i>
- I don't think so.</i>

1075
01:12:31,184 --> 01:12:33,186
不是从Kronos来的
<i>It's not coming at us from Kronos.</i>

1076
01:12:38,316 --> 01:12:39,526
上尉，把Khan转移到医疗舱
Lieutenant, move Khan to med bay.

1077
01:12:39,609 --> 01:12:40,860
找6个安全保卫人员看着他
Post six security officers on him.

1078
01:12:40,985 --> 01:12:42,028
是的，舰长
Yes, Captain.

1079
01:12:42,362 --> 01:12:43,697
舰长到
Captain on the bridge!

1080
01:12:44,531 --> 01:12:46,032
预计来舰的到达时间
ETA of the incoming ship.

1081
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:47,450
3秒钟，长官
Three seconds, sir.

1082
01:12:49,369 --> 01:12:51,371
-启动护盾 -是的，舰长
- Shields.
- Aye, Captain.

1083
01:13:15,729 --> 01:13:16,813
他们在联络我们，长官
They're hailing us, sir.

1084
01:13:18,231 --> 01:13:19,566
放到屏幕上
On screen.

1085
01:13:20,567 --> 01:13:22,819
向全舰广播，记录在案
Broadcast shipwide, for the record.

1086
01:13:26,906 --> 01:13:28,241
Kirk舰长
<i>Captain Kirk.</i>

1087
01:13:29,659 --> 01:13:32,328
Marcus将军，我没想到是你
Admiral Marcus. I wasn't expecting you.

1088
01:13:33,246 --> 01:13:35,040
这飞船真是不错
That's a hell of a ship you got there.

1089
01:13:35,248 --> 01:13:36,416
而且我没想到你会
<i>And I wasn't expecting to get word</i>

1090
01:13:36,499 --> 01:13:38,084
把Harrison关押起来
<i>that you'd taken Harrison into custody</i>

1091
01:13:38,251 --> 01:13:39,878
这违背了你的命令
<i>in violation of your orders.</i>

1092
01:13:40,712 --> 01:13:42,380
好吧，我们...
Well, we...

1093
01:13:42,422 --> 01:13:44,424
得即兴发挥了，因为我们的跃迁核心
We had to improvise when our warp core

1094
01:13:44,507 --> 01:13:46,468
意外的发生了故障
unexpectedly malfunctioned.

1095
01:13:46,551 --> 01:13:48,511
但是您已经知道了，不是吗，先生？
But you already knew that,
didn't you, sir?

1096
01:13:48,678 --> 01:13:50,055
我不明白你的意思
<i>I don't take your meaning.</i>

1097
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:51,723
当然，不过这正是你来这的原因，不是吗？
Well, that's why you're here, isn't it?

1098
01:13:51,765 --> 01:13:53,892
来帮助我们维修?
To assist with our repairs?

1099
01:13:54,559 --> 01:13:56,227
要么为什么星际舰队的将军
Why else would the head of Starfleet

1100
01:13:56,269 --> 01:13:58,229
会亲自来到中立地带的边缘？
personally come to the edge
of the Neutral Zone?

1101
01:13:59,606 --> 01:14:01,232
长官，他们在扫描我们的飞船
Captain, they're scanning our ship.

1102
01:14:01,441 --> 01:14:03,485
我可以帮您找您需要的东西吗，长官？
Is there something
I can help you find, sir?

1103
01:14:04,402 --> 01:14:06,071
你的囚犯在哪，Kirk ？
<i>Where is your prisoner, Kirk?</i>

1104
01:14:06,112 --> 01:14:07,322
根据星际舰队的条例
Per Starfleet regulation,

1105
01:14:07,489 --> 01:14:11,618
我正打算把Khan带到地球去进行审判
I'm planning on returning Khan
to Earth to stand trial.

1106
01:14:12,744 --> 01:14:14,412
真是见鬼
Well, shit.

1107
01:14:15,413 --> 01:14:16,915
你跟他谈了
You talked to him.

1108
01:14:18,124 --> 01:14:20,627
这正是我不想你去做的
This is exactly what I was
hoping to spare you from.

1109
01:14:20,877 --> 01:14:23,588
我冒了战术性的风险唤醒了那个家伙
<i>I took a tactical risk
and I woke that bastard up,</i>

1110
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:26,049
认为他的高级智慧
<i>believing that his superior intelligence</i>

1111
01:14:26,257 --> 01:14:29,052
可以保护我们免受将来可能遇到的威胁
could help us protect ourselves
from whatever came at us next.

1112
01:14:30,887 --> 01:14:32,222
但是我犯了一个错误
But I made a mistake.

1113
01:14:32,722 --> 01:14:36,393
而现在他杀的每一个人都算在我的头上
<i>And now the blood
of everybody he's killed is on my hands.</i>

1114
01:14:36,976 --> 01:14:38,978
所以我请你
So I'm asking you,

1115
01:14:39,145 --> 01:14:40,855
把他给我
give him to me

1116
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:44,025
那样我才可以弥补我的过失
so that I can end what I started.

1117
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:48,780
不过您希望我怎么处置
And what exactly
would you like me to do

1118
01:14:48,822 --> 01:14:50,740
他的其他船员，长官？
with the rest of his crew, sir?

1119
01:14:52,242 --> 01:14:55,829
把他们发射到Klingon人那里？终结72个生命？
Fire them at the Klingons?
End 72 lives?

1120
01:14:55,954 --> 01:14:57,497
然后引发一场战争？
Start a war in the process?

1121
01:14:57,622 --> 01:15:00,417
是他把这些人放在鱼雷里的
He put those people in those torpedoes.

1122
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:02,127
而且我甚至不想增加你的负担
<i>And I simply didn't want to burden you</i>

1123
01:15:02,168 --> 01:15:04,337
所以才没告诉你鱼雷里边有什么
<i>with knowing what was inside of them.</i>

1124
01:15:04,504 --> 01:15:06,339
你看见那个人自己有多厉害了
<i>You saw what this man
can do all by himself.</i>

1125
01:15:06,506 --> 01:15:10,260
你可以想象如果他的船员都醒了会是什么样子吗？
<i>Can you imagine what would happen
if we woke up the rest of his crew?</i>

1126
01:15:11,011 --> 01:15:13,346
他还告诉你什么了？他是个和平守护者？
What else did he tell you?
That he's a peacekeeper?

1127
01:15:13,596 --> 01:15:16,349
他在耍你，孩子，难道你没看出来？
<i>He's playing you, son,
don't you see that?</i>

1128
01:15:16,558 --> 01:15:20,061
Khan和他的船员因战争罪被判处了死刑
<i>Khan and his crew were condemned
to death as war criminals.</i>

1129
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,605
现在我们的职责就是执行它
<i>And now it is our duty
to carry out that sentence</i>

1130
01:15:22,689 --> 01:15:25,066
在他还没弄死其他人的时候
<i>before anybody else
dies because of him.</i>

1131
01:15:27,694 --> 01:15:30,030
现在，我再问你一次
Now, I'm going to ask you again!

1132
01:15:30,864 --> 01:15:33,116
最后一次，孩子
One last time, son.

1133
01:15:34,868 --> 01:15:36,578
放下你的护盾
<i>Lower your shields.</i>

1134
01:15:37,037 --> 01:15:38,788
告诉我他在哪
<i>Tell me where he is.</i>

1135
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:43,626
他在轮机室，长官
He's in engineering, sir.

1136
01:15:45,295 --> 01:15:46,713
不过我会把他
But I'll have him moved

1137
01:15:46,796 --> 01:15:48,798
马上带到传送室的
to the transporter room right away.

1138
01:15:48,965 --> 01:15:50,800
到那里我会接手的
<i>I'll take it from here.</i>

1139
01:15:51,551 --> 01:15:52,552
别放下护盾
Do not drop those shields,

1140
01:15:52,635 --> 01:15:53,636
-Sulu先生 -是的，长官
- Mr. Sulu.
- Aye, Captain.

1141
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:54,721
舰长，鉴于您清楚的知道
Captain, given your awareness

1142
01:15:54,804 --> 01:15:56,306
Khan的真实位置是在医疗室
of Khan's true location in the med bay,

1143
01:15:56,389 --> 01:15:58,058
我能了解一下您的计划吗？
may I know the details of your plan?

1144
01:15:58,141 --> 01:16:01,061
我告诉Marcus我们要把罪犯带回地球
I told Marcus we were
bringing a fugitive back to Earth.

1145
01:16:01,144 --> 01:16:02,812
那就是我们要做的
That's what we're going to do.

1146
01:16:03,104 --> 01:16:04,522
Chekov先生，我们可以跃迁了吗？
Mr. Chekov, can we warp?

1147
01:16:04,647 --> 01:16:06,232
长官，如果我们跃迁的话
Sir, if we go to warp,

1148
01:16:06,358 --> 01:16:09,486
我们得冒严重损坏核心的风险
we run the risk of
seriously damaging the core!

1149
01:16:09,569 --> 01:16:10,945
我们能跃迁吗？
<i>Can we do it?</i>

1150
01:16:11,738 --> 01:16:15,450
技术上说，可以，但是我不建议那么做，舰长。
Technically, yes, but I
would not advise it, Captain.

1151
01:16:15,742 --> 01:16:16,951
知道了
Noted.

1152
01:16:17,744 --> 01:16:19,913
Sulu先生，设置去地球的航线
Mr. Sulu, set course for Earth.

1153
01:16:19,996 --> 01:16:21,039
是的长官
Yes, sir.

1154
01:16:22,207 --> 01:16:23,583
跃迁
Punch it.

1155
01:16:30,548 --> 01:16:33,426
好吧，至少我们又有进展了
Well, at least we're moving again.

1156
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:38,890
如果你觉得跃迁是安全的，你就错了
If you think you're safe
at warp, you're wrong.

1157
01:16:42,769 --> 01:16:44,396
Uhura上尉，联系星际舰队
Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet.

1158
01:16:44,437 --> 01:16:45,939
报告说我们在中立地带
Tell them we were pursued
into the Neutral Zone

1159
01:16:46,064 --> 01:16:47,691
被一艘不明联邦战舰追击
by an unmarked Federation ship.

1160
01:16:47,774 --> 01:16:48,817
通讯中断了，长官
Comms are down, sir.

1161
01:16:51,361 --> 01:16:52,445
请求登录舰舷
Permission to come on the bridge.

1162
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:53,571
Marcus博士
Dr. Marcus.

1163
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,615
他会抓住我们的，当他抓住我们时
He's gonna catch up with us,
and when he does,

1164
01:16:55,699 --> 01:16:57,075
唯一能阻止他毁掉这艘船的人
the only thing
that's gonna stop him destroying

1165
01:16:57,117 --> 01:16:58,576
就是我，所以你让我和他通话
this ship is me,
so you have to let me talk to him.

1166
01:16:58,618 --> 01:17:00,453
Carol，我们在跃迁，他不可能抓住我们
Carol, we're at warp.
He can't catch up with us.

1167
01:17:00,537 --> 01:17:01,788
不，他可以。他已经研制出了
Yes, he can.
He's been developing a ship

1168
01:17:01,913 --> 01:17:03,206
具有高级跃迁能力的战舰...
that has advanced warp capabilities...

1169
01:17:03,289 --> 01:17:05,875
舰长！我侦测到读数，我不明白。
Captain! I'm getting
a reading I don't understand.

1170
01:17:35,822 --> 01:17:36,823
我们在哪？
Where are we?

1171
01:17:36,906 --> 01:17:38,116
我们距离地球237'000千米
We're 237,000 kilometers from Earth.

1172
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:39,159
-损坏报告！ -武器严重损毁
- Damage report!
- Weapons are way down.

1173
01:17:39,284 --> 01:17:40,660
-护盾在失效 -我们失去防御了，长官
- Shields are dropping.
- We're defenseless, sir.

1174
01:17:40,744 --> 01:17:41,995
长官，我们的隔离舱破裂
Sir, we have a bulkhead breach.

1175
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:44,080
-损毁的地方在哪？ -主结构损毁，舰长
- Where's the damage?
- Major hull damage, Captain.

1176
01:17:49,627 --> 01:17:52,005
规避动作！快回到地球上，快！
Evasive maneuvers! Get us to Earth!
Right now!

1177
01:17:52,172 --> 01:17:55,383
舰长！别！这艘船上的每个人都会死的
Captain! Stop!
Everybody on this ship is going to die

1178
01:17:55,467 --> 01:17:56,676
如果你不让我和他通话
if you don't let me speak to him.

1179
01:17:59,179 --> 01:18:00,972
Uhura，联系他
Uhura, hail him.

1180
01:18:01,639 --> 01:18:03,975
长官，是我，Carol
Sir. It's me. It's Carol.

1181
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:16,237
你在那艘船上干什么？
<i>What are you doing on that ship?</i>

1182
01:18:16,446 --> 01:18:18,114
我听到你说的话了
I heard what you said.

1183
01:18:19,783 --> 01:18:20,950
你说你犯了个错误
That you made a mistake

1184
01:18:21,034 --> 01:18:23,453
现在你将不惜代价去弥补它
and now you're doing
everything you can to fix it.

1185
01:18:24,621 --> 01:18:25,955
但是，爸爸
But, Dad,

1186
01:18:29,334 --> 01:18:33,046
我不相信一个养育我的人
I don't believe that
the man who raised me

1187
01:18:33,129 --> 01:18:37,759
会去毁掉一艘里边满是无辜的人的船飞
is capable of destroying a ship
full of innocent people.

1188
01:18:38,009 --> 01:18:40,720
不过，如果我错了
<i>And, if I'm wrong about that,</i>

1189
01:18:40,804 --> 01:18:43,223
那么你就要把我一起杀死
then you're gonna have to
do it with me on board.

1190
01:18:46,309 --> 01:18:47,977
实际上，Carol，我不会的
<i>Actually, Carol, I won't.</i>

1191
01:18:52,982 --> 01:18:54,401
-Jim... -我们可以干扰传输信号吗？
- Jim...
- Can we intercept the transport signal?

1192
01:18:54,567 --> 01:18:55,568
不能，长官
No, sir.

1193
01:18:57,862 --> 01:18:58,863
Carol!

1194
01:18:59,489 --> 01:19:01,366
Kirk舰长，在没有授权的情况下
<i>Captain Kirk, without authorization</i>

1195
01:19:01,449 --> 01:19:03,576
和罪犯John Harrison合谋
<i>and in league with
the fugitive John Harrison,</i>

1196
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:05,537
你和敌人同流合污
<i>you went rogue in enemy territory,</i>

1197
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:06,663
让我别无选择
<i>leaving me no choice</i>

1198
01:19:06,746 --> 01:19:08,665
只有抓住并毁掉你
<i>but to hunt you down and destroy you.</i>

1199
01:19:08,998 --> 01:19:11,251
-相位炮锁定 -等等，长官，等等，等等！
<i>- Lock phasers.</i>
- Wait, sir, wait, wait, wait!

1200
01:19:11,418 --> 01:19:12,419
我会简短截说
<i>I'll make this quick.</i>

1201
01:19:12,502 --> 01:19:14,796
目标是所有在企业号船尾的鱼雷
<i>Target all aft torpedoes
on the</i> Enterprise <i>bridge.</i>

1202
01:19:15,005 --> 01:19:17,340
长官，我的船员只是服从我的命令
Sir, my crew
was just following my orders.

1203
01:19:17,424 --> 01:19:19,968
我对我的行为负全责
I take full responsibility for my actions.

1204
01:19:20,051 --> 01:19:22,095
所有的决定都是我做的，我自己做的
But they were mine
and they were mine alone.

1205
01:19:23,096 --> 01:19:25,098
如果我现在把Khan的位置发送给你
If I transmit Khan's location to you now,

1206
01:19:25,265 --> 01:19:27,600
我的唯一要求是放了他们
all that I ask is that you spare them.

1207
01:19:34,441 --> 01:19:36,276
恳求您，长官
Please, sir.

1208
01:19:38,111 --> 01:19:40,280
我什么都可以做
I'll do anything you want.

1209
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:43,533
只要你放了他们
Just let them live.

1210
01:19:45,035 --> 01:19:47,454
这确实算是个道歉
That's a hell of an apology.

1211
01:19:47,704 --> 01:19:49,789
不过只能起到慰籍的作用
But if it's any consolation,

1212
01:19:49,873 --> 01:19:51,875
我不会放过你的船员的
I was never going to spare your crew.

1213
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,295
开火...
<i>Fire when...</i>

1214
01:20:15,732 --> 01:20:16,941
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1215
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,408
我们的武器失灵了，长官
Our weapons won't fire, sir!

1216
01:20:25,492 --> 01:20:26,743
我们的护盾失效！我们失去动力了！
Our shields are down!
We're losing power!

1217
01:20:26,826 --> 01:20:29,079
有人在轮机室手动重置了我们的系统
Someone in engineering
just manually reset our systems!

1218
01:20:29,329 --> 01:20:31,623
有人是什么意思，谁？
What do you mean, "someone"? Who?

1219
01:20:31,706 --> 01:20:34,334
他们的武器失灵了，长官
Their weapons have powered down. Sir.

1220
01:20:34,417 --> 01:20:36,711
企业号！能听到我说话吗？
Enterprise! <i>Can you hear me?</i>

1221
01:20:36,795 --> 01:20:37,879
Scotty!

1222
01:20:40,006 --> 01:20:42,008
猜我在木星后边发现了什么
Guess what I found behind Jupiter.

1223
01:20:42,133 --> 01:20:44,010
-你在那艘船上！ -我偷偷上来的
- You're on that ship!<i>
- I snuck on.</i>

1224
01:20:44,135 --> 01:20:45,512
而且我刚做了背叛
And seeing as I've just
committed an act of treason

1225
01:20:45,595 --> 01:20:47,180
星际舰队将军的坏事，我真的想
against a Starfleet Admiral, I'd really like

1226
01:20:47,263 --> 01:20:49,432
马上离开这该死的飞船。快把我传送出去！
to get off this bloody ship.
Now beam me out!

1227
01:20:49,599 --> 01:20:50,684
你真是个神奇的工程师
You're a miracle worker.

1228
01:20:50,767 --> 01:20:52,602
我们现在能量不太够
We're a little low on power right now.

1229
01:20:52,727 --> 01:20:53,770
稍微等会，原地待命
<i>Just stand by. Stand by.</i>

1230
01:20:53,853 --> 01:20:55,063
“能量不够”你什么意思 ？
What do you mean, "low on power"?

1231
01:20:55,146 --> 01:20:56,356
企业号怎么了？
What happened to the <i>Enterprise?</i>

1232
01:20:57,065 --> 01:20:58,358
回头打给你
Call you back.

1233
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:01,277
Scotty!

1234
01:21:02,529 --> 01:21:04,948
Spock，我们的船怎么样了？
Spock. Our ship, how is she?

1235
01:21:05,365 --> 01:21:06,825
我们的选择很少，舰长
Our options are limited, Captain.

1236
01:21:06,908 --> 01:21:08,868
我们又不能反击，又不能逃跑
We cannot fire and we cannot flee.

1237
01:21:12,038 --> 01:21:13,206
只有一条选择
There is one option.

1238
01:21:13,415 --> 01:21:15,166
Uhura，当你联系上Scotty的时候
Uhura, when you get Scotty back,

1239
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:17,043
-给我连他的线 -好的，长官
- patch him through.
- Yes, sir.

1240
01:21:17,252 --> 01:21:18,420
Spock先生，你负责指挥
Mr. Spock, you have the conn.

1241
01:21:22,632 --> 01:21:24,509
舰长，我强烈反对
Captain, I strongly object.

1242
01:21:24,551 --> 01:21:26,386
反对什么？我还什么都没说呢
To what? I haven't said anything yet.

1243
01:21:26,469 --> 01:21:28,054
既然我们从那船的外边无法下手，那我们就从里边下手
Since we cannot take
the ship from the outside,

1244
01:21:28,138 --> 01:21:29,639
我们唯一的机会就是从里边干掉它
the only way we can take it
is from within.

1245
01:21:29,723 --> 01:21:31,349
不过人员过多的话会被发现的
And as a large boarding party
would be detected,

1246
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:32,475
最佳方式是你带着
it is optimal for you to take

1247
01:21:32,559 --> 01:21:34,310
尽可能少的船员去
as few members
of the crew as possible.

1248
01:21:34,394 --> 01:21:36,896
你会遇到抵抗，需要船员
You will meet resistance,
requiring personnel

1249
01:21:37,022 --> 01:21:38,064
有高素质的战斗技能
with advanced combat abilities

1250
01:21:38,148 --> 01:21:39,983
还有对那艘船的机构必须有所了解
and innate knowledge of that ship.

1251
01:21:40,233 --> 01:21:42,277
这就意味着你的计划必须和Khan联手
This indicates that you plan to align with Khan,

1252
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,237
正是我们要干掉的那个家伙
the very man we were sent here to destroy.

1253
01:21:44,487 --> 01:21:46,114
我不是和他联手，我在利用他
I'm not aligning with him, I'm using him.

1254
01:21:46,197 --> 01:21:48,158
我敌人的敌人就是我的朋友
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."

1255
01:21:48,241 --> 01:21:50,285
一个阿拉伯的谚语关于一个王子
An Arabic proverb attributed
to a prince who was

1256
01:21:50,368 --> 01:21:52,078
被自己人出卖了然后砍头了
betrayed and decapitated
by his own subjects.

1257
01:21:52,162 --> 01:21:54,330
不过，只是个引用
Still, it's a hell of a quote.

1258
01:21:54,414 --> 01:21:56,666
-我要和你一起去，舰长。 -不，我需要你在船上
- I will go with you, Captain.
- No, I need you on the bridge.

1259
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:58,543
我不能允许你这么干
I cannot allow you to do this.

1260
01:21:58,585 --> 01:22:00,378
我在这里的职责就是给你
It is my function aboard
this ship to advise you

1261
01:22:00,462 --> 01:22:01,880
最合理的建议
on making the wisest
decisions possible,

1262
01:22:01,963 --> 01:22:03,048
我十分的确信
something I firmly believe

1263
01:22:03,131 --> 01:22:04,591
你在这个节骨眼上不可以这么做
you are incapable
of doing in this moment.

1264
01:22:04,758 --> 01:22:06,092
你是对的
You're right!

1265
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:09,220
我将要做的事，一点都说不通
What I'm about to do,
it doesn't make any sense,

1266
01:22:09,429 --> 01:22:11,890
更谈不上逻辑。只是一种直觉
it's not logical. It is a gut feeling.

1267
01:22:15,268 --> 01:22:17,854
我将要做什么我都不知道
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

1268
01:22:19,022 --> 01:22:21,274
我只知道我能做什么
I only know what I can do.

1269
01:22:21,858 --> 01:22:23,485
企业号和她的船员需要有人
The <i>Enterprise</i> and her crew
need someone

1270
01:22:23,568 --> 01:22:26,321
坐在那个位置上，并且知道该做什么
in that chair that knows what he's doing.

1271
01:22:29,866 --> 01:22:31,284
不过那人不是我
And it's not me.

1272
01:22:34,204 --> 01:22:35,538
而是你，Spock
It's you, Spock.

1273
01:22:58,395 --> 01:23:00,063
告诉我关于那艘船你知道的所有事情
Tell me everything you know
about that ship.

1274
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,232
无畏级
Dreadnought class.

1275
01:23:02,315 --> 01:23:03,983
两倍大，三倍速度
Two times the size,
three times the speed.

1276
01:23:04,067 --> 01:23:06,945
高级武器系统。为小型舰队改造的
Advanced weaponry.
Modified for a minimal crew.

1277
01:23:06,986 --> 01:23:09,906
并不像大多的联邦飞船一样，而是纯粹为战斗打造的
Unlike most Federation vessels,
it's built solely for combat.

1278
01:23:11,074 --> 01:23:13,326
我会尽我所能
I will do everything I can

1279
01:23:13,993 --> 01:23:16,287
会对你所做的进行应有的评判
to make you answer for what you did.

1280
01:23:22,502 --> 01:23:24,129
不过现在，我需要你的帮助
But right now I need your help.

1281
01:23:24,254 --> 01:23:26,172
拿什么做交换条件
In exchange for what?

1282
01:23:27,507 --> 01:23:29,843
你说过你会为你的船员做任何事情
You said you'd do anything
for your crew.

1283
01:23:31,344 --> 01:23:34,180
-我可以保证他们的安全 -舰长
- I can guarantee their safety.
- Captain.

1284
01:23:35,015 --> 01:23:38,685
你甚至不能保证你自己船员的安全
You can't even guarantee
the safety of your own crew.

1285
01:23:44,691 --> 01:23:46,443
Bones，你弄那个tribble干什么？
(tribble:一种温顺的外星生物)
Bones, what are you doing
with that tribble?

1286
01:23:47,277 --> 01:23:48,611
这个tribble已经死了
The tribble's dead.

1287
01:23:48,695 --> 01:23:52,157
我正给这个坏死的组织注射Khan的血小板
I'm injecting Khan's platelets into
the deceased tissue of a necrotic host.

1288
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:55,660
Khan的细胞可以再生我从来没见过
Khan's cells regenerate
like nothing I've ever seen,

1289
01:23:55,744 --> 01:23:57,495
我想弄明白为什么
and I want to know why.

1290
01:24:02,625 --> 01:24:04,878
你到底跟我来不？
You coming with me or not?

1291
01:24:07,464 --> 01:24:09,132
你要我做什么？
You want to do what?

1292
01:24:09,299 --> 01:24:10,675
我们要去那里。Sulu正在调整
We're coming over there.
Sulu's maneuvering

1293
01:24:10,717 --> 01:24:12,552
企业号到我们指定的位置
the <i>Enterprise</i>
into position as we speak.

1294
01:24:12,635 --> 01:24:14,095
到这艘船里？怎么来？
<i>To this ship? How?</i>

1295
01:24:14,346 --> 01:24:16,723
那有一个货物门，7号仓库，入口101A
There's a cargo door,
hangar 7, access port 101A.

1296
01:24:16,806 --> 01:24:18,892
需要你找到那里手动打开那个空气锁
You need to find
the manual override to open that airlock.

1297
01:24:18,975 --> 01:24:21,895
不管你是谁，你是不是疯了？
Are you crazy? Whoever you are.

1298
01:24:22,062 --> 01:24:23,855
照他说的去做，Scotty，没问题的
Just listen to him, Scotty.
It's gonna be all right.

1299
01:24:24,022 --> 01:24:25,398
不可能没问题
It is not gonna be all right.

1300
01:24:25,482 --> 01:24:27,275
你要我打开通向空间的空气锁
You want me to open
an airlock into space,

1301
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:30,236
之后我会冻死，然后炸开
whereupon I will freeze,
die and explode!

1302
01:24:30,487 --> 01:24:31,946
上尉，从我们现在的位置，
Lieutenant,
from our current position, is it possible

1303
01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:33,990
联系新Vulcan地区行的通吗？
to establish contact with New Vulcan?

1304
01:24:34,657 --> 01:24:37,160
-我会尽我所能 - 谢谢
- I'll do my best.
- Thank you.

1305
01:24:38,912 --> 01:24:41,247
Sulu先生，对方的飞船什么状态
Mr. Sulu, what is
the status of the other ship?

1306
01:24:41,331 --> 01:24:42,916
他们的系统依然未启动
Their systems are still offline.

1307
01:24:42,999 --> 01:24:44,834
我正在对两艘船进行对齐
I'm aligning our ship now.

1308
01:25:19,285 --> 01:25:20,453
Scotty，那边怎么样？
Scotty, how we doing over there?

1309
01:25:20,954 --> 01:25:22,956
舰长，我希望我们有好消息
<i>Captain, I wish I had better news.</i>

1310
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:25,709
他们锁定了进入飞船的电脑
<i>They've locked out access
to the ship's computer.</i>

1311
01:25:25,792 --> 01:25:27,377
他们的所有武器会在
<i>They'll have full weapons in</i>

1312
01:25:27,752 --> 01:25:28,962
三分钟内恢复
three minutes.

1313
01:25:29,004 --> 01:25:29,630
那就意味着下次
That means next time 

1314
01:25:29,714 --> 01:25:31,549
我就无法阻止他们毁掉企业号了
I won't be able to stop them destroying the <i>Enterprise.</i>

1314
01:25:31,714 --> 01:25:32,549
稍等
Stand by.

1315
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:35,301
长官，我们的垃圾通道对准了
Commander, our trash exhaust
is aimed at

1316
01:25:35,385 --> 01:25:37,637
另一艘船的101A通道
access port 101A of the other ship.

1317
01:25:37,721 --> 01:25:39,472
舰长，飞船已经对齐
Captain, the ships are aligned.

1318
01:25:39,597 --> 01:25:40,598
收到
Copy that.

1319
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:43,768
-Scotty！-我在舱里了，给我点时间
- Scotty!
- I'm in the hangar. Give me a minute.

1320
01:25:48,064 --> 01:25:50,400
我正在跑，稍等
I'm running. Stand by.

1321
01:26:00,243 --> 01:26:01,745
喔，喔，等会，好了，舰长
Whoa, whoa, hold on, now, Captain.

1322
01:26:01,828 --> 01:26:04,748
这个门就那么一点点。我的意思是说，很小
This door is very wee.
I mean, you know, small.

1323
01:26:04,956 --> 01:26:06,958
顶多4平方米
It's four square meters, tops.

1324
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:09,044
就好比从一辆移动的车里跳出来
It's gonna be like
jumping out of a moving car,

1325
01:26:09,127 --> 01:26:11,046
飞下大桥，跳进一个玻璃杯里
off a bridge, into your shot glass.

1326
01:26:11,254 --> 01:26:13,006
没关系，我以前干过
It's okay. I've done it before.

1327
01:26:14,924 --> 01:26:16,009
不过，那是直线的
Yeah, it was vertical.

1328
01:26:16,092 --> 01:26:19,012
我们跳进一个...就是...
We jumped onto a... It was a...

1329
01:26:19,095 --> 01:26:20,305
这不重要。Scotty...
It doesn't matter. Scotty...

1330
01:26:20,347 --> 01:26:21,556
你找到手动开关没有？
Did you find the manual override?

1331
01:26:21,639 --> 01:26:22,932
手动控制开关，Scotty
The manual override, Scotty.

1332
01:26:23,183 --> 01:26:24,851
还没有，还没有
Not yet, not yet.

1333
01:26:31,441 --> 01:26:33,109
舰长，在你发射之前，你应该知道
Captain, before you launch,
you should be aware there is

1334
01:26:33,193 --> 01:26:34,986
有一片必须要考虑的太空垃圾在两艘船之间
a considerable debris field
between our ships.

1335
01:26:35,195 --> 01:26:37,781
-Spock，现在别了。Scotty，你弄好没？-这并不简单
- Spock, not now. Scotty, you good?
- It's not easy!

1336
01:26:37,864 --> 01:26:40,617
再给我2秒钟，好吗，你这个疯子
Just give me two seconds,
all right, you mad bastard!

1337
01:26:48,792 --> 01:26:51,127
告诉我这能行
Tell me this is gonna work.

1338
01:26:51,961 --> 01:26:53,380
我既没有这把握
I have neither
the information

1339
01:26:53,463 --> 01:26:55,298
也没有这勇气去告诉你，医生
nor the confidence to do so, Doctor.

1340
01:26:55,465 --> 01:26:56,800
ok，舰长，准备
<i>Okay, Captain, stand by.</i>

1341
01:26:57,133 --> 01:26:58,551
小子，你真是令人安慰啊
Boy, you're a real comfort.

1342
01:26:59,969 --> 01:27:01,971
来吧，来吧，来吧
Come on, come on, come on.

1343
01:27:02,097 --> 01:27:03,139
好了！
Yes!

1344
01:27:03,264 --> 01:27:04,849
ok，ok！我准备打开门了
<i>Okay, okay! I'm set to open the door.</i>

1345
01:27:04,891 --> 01:27:06,059
你准备好了吗？
You ready?

1346
01:27:06,226 --> 01:27:07,560
你呢？
Are you?

1347
01:27:10,814 --> 01:27:12,148
Spock，扣动扳机吧
Spock, pull the trigger.

1348
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,401
是的，舰长
Yes, Captain.

1349
01:27:20,156 --> 01:27:21,825
准备发射倒数
Launching activation sequence on

1350
01:27:22,075 --> 01:27:23,410
3
<i>three,</i>

1351
01:27:23,535 --> 01:27:24,703
2
<i>two,</i>

1352
01:27:25,412 --> 01:27:26,413
1
<i>one.</i>

1353
01:27:36,673 --> 01:27:39,259
长官，Kirk马上就要在432位置撞上障碍物了
Sir, Kirk is headed for collision at .432!

1354
01:27:39,592 --> 01:27:41,344
舰长，你的正前方有太空垃圾
Captain, there is debris directly ahead.

1355
01:27:41,428 --> 01:27:42,429
收到
Copy that.

1356
01:27:46,433 --> 01:27:47,851
喔！Jim，你偏离航线太多了
Whoa! Jim, you're way off course!

1357
01:27:48,018 --> 01:27:49,102
我知道，我知道，我能看见
I know, I know! I can see that.

1358
01:27:59,738 --> 01:28:01,239
别动
Don't move.

1359
01:28:03,533 --> 01:28:05,035
使用你的罗盘面板，舰长
Use your display compass, Captain.

1360
01:28:05,118 --> 01:28:06,161
你必须精确的校正
You must correct precisely

1361
01:28:06,244 --> 01:28:08,329
-37.243度 -收到
- 37.243 degrees.<i>
- Got it.</i>

1362
01:28:08,621 --> 01:28:09,622
我正回到我的轨道上来
I'm working my way back.

1363
01:28:12,459 --> 01:28:14,336
Scotty，你准备好开门了是吧？
Scotty, you're gonna be ready
with that door, right?

1364
01:28:15,670 --> 01:28:17,005
你在那干什么？
What are you doing in here?

1365
01:28:17,464 --> 01:28:21,134
给空气锁做点维护。你可真壮
Wee bit of maintenance
on the airlock console. You're big.

1366
01:28:21,259 --> 01:28:22,594
Scott先生，你在哪？
Mr. Scott, where are you?

1367
01:28:22,635 --> 01:28:24,012
舰长，他似乎听不见你说话
Captain, he can't seem to hear you.

1368
01:28:24,095 --> 01:28:26,014
我正试图重新联系上他，稍等
I'm working on getting
his signal back. Stand by.

1369
01:28:28,725 --> 01:28:30,560
-该死 -舰长，怎么了？
- Damn it.<i>
- Captain, what is it?</i>

1370
01:28:30,643 --> 01:28:31,644
我的头盔被击中了
My helmet was hit.

1371
01:28:31,728 --> 01:28:33,313
Uhura，告诉我你把Scott弄回来了
Uhura, tell me you have Mr. Scott back.

1372
01:28:33,563 --> 01:28:34,898
还没有，我还在弄信号
Not yet. I'm still working on a signal.

1373
01:28:35,065 --> 01:28:36,524
他的通讯器没问题
<i>His communicator is working.</i>

1374
01:28:36,649 --> 01:28:38,693
-我不明白为什么他没回应 -那是什么？
<i>- I don't know why he isn't responding.</i>
- What is that?

1375
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:40,320
你是星际舰队的安全人员，还是私人的？
Are you Starfleet or private security?

1376
01:28:40,403 --> 01:28:41,404
让我看到你另外一只手
Show me your other hand.

1377
01:28:41,488 --> 01:28:42,572
我觉得你像死人安全人员
Because you look like private security.

1378
01:28:42,655 --> 01:28:44,115
侦测到紧急碰撞
Imminent collision detected!

1379
01:28:44,282 --> 01:28:45,325
Khan，规避动作！
Khan, use evasive action!

1380
01:28:45,367 --> 01:28:47,452
-正前方有太空垃圾 -我看见了
- There is debris directly ahead.
- I see it.

1381
01:28:54,501 --> 01:28:55,710
Sulu先生，我们失去Khan了？
Mr. Sulu, did we lose Khan?

1382
01:28:55,835 --> 01:28:58,213
我不知道，长官，在这些垃圾中追踪他的信号很困难
I don't know, Commander. I'm having
trouble tracking him in all this debris.

1383
01:28:59,089 --> 01:29:00,340
Khan撞上了？
Was Khan hit?

1384
01:29:00,423 --> 01:29:01,675
我们正试图找到他
We are trying to find him now.

1385
01:29:02,008 --> 01:29:03,635
舰长，你需要校正你的目标点
Captain, you need to adjust
your target destination

1386
01:29:03,677 --> 01:29:06,012
到183，调整473度
to 183 by 473 degrees.

1387
01:29:17,357 --> 01:29:19,442
Spock，我的显示面板坏了，没有导航了
Spock, my display's dead.
I'm flying blind.

1388
01:29:20,026 --> 01:29:21,695
舰长，不依靠你的导航面板
Captain, without your display compass,

1389
01:29:21,778 --> 01:29:23,613
你进入预定目标的几率几乎为零
hitting your target destination
is mathematically impossible.

1390
01:29:23,947 --> 01:29:25,156
Spock，如果我能回去
Spock, if I get back,

1391
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:26,950
我们真的谈谈你跟人沟通的方式
we really need to talk
about your bedside manner.

1392
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,202
长官，他肯定不行的
Commander, he's not going to make it.

1393
01:29:34,749 --> 01:29:36,376
我的显示面板功能正常
My display is still functioning.

1394
01:29:36,459 --> 01:29:38,128
我看见你了，Kirk，你在我前方200米
I see you, Kirk,
you're 200 meters ahead of me

1395
01:29:38,211 --> 01:29:39,421
在我1点钟方向
at my one o'clock.

1396
01:29:39,504 --> 01:29:41,548
偏左几度然后跟着我
Come to your left
a few degrees and follow me.

1397
01:29:54,185 --> 01:29:55,562
Scotty，我们越来越近了，我们需要热烈欢迎
Scotty, we're getting close.
We need a warm welcome.

1398
01:29:55,729 --> 01:29:58,189
收到没有？收到没有？Scotty？
Do you copy? Do you copy? Scotty?

1399
01:29:58,231 --> 01:29:59,566
如果你能听到我们说话，Scott先生
If you can hear us, Mr. Scott,

1400
01:29:59,649 --> 01:30:01,443
-请打开大门倒数，9... -Scotty！
- open the door in ten, nine...
- Scotty!

1401
01:30:01,568 --> 01:30:02,569
那个人在倒数
That person counting down,

1402
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:03,611
-是什么意思？ - ...8...
- what is that?<i>
- ...eight...</i>

1403
01:30:03,695 --> 01:30:04,779
我觉得你可能是幻听了，哥们。
I think you're hearing things, mate.

1404
01:30:04,904 --> 01:30:06,740
-...7... -Scott先生，你在哪？
- ...seven...
- Mr. Scott, where are you?

1405
01:30:06,781 --> 01:30:09,868
-...6，5... -1'800米。1'600米
- ...six, five...
- 1,800 meters. 1,600 meters.

1406
01:30:10,035 --> 01:30:11,327
-Scotty，你在哪？ -...3...
- Scotty, where are you?
- ...three...

1407
01:30:11,453 --> 01:30:13,246
-收到没有，Scotty？拜托 -... 2...
- Do you copy, Scotty? Please!<i>
- ...two...</i>

1408
01:30:13,371 --> 01:30:14,497
-我很抱歉 -抱歉什么？
- Sorry about this.
- About what?

1409
01:30:14,622 --> 01:30:15,832
-Scott先生，打开大门！-打开大门
- Mr. Scott, open the door!
- Open the door!

1410
01:30:15,957 --> 01:30:17,542
Scott先生，现在！
<i>Mr. Scott, now!</i>

1411
01:30:38,772 --> 01:30:40,398
欢迎登船
Welcome aboard.

1412
01:30:42,108 --> 01:30:44,319
-很高兴见到你Scotty -他是谁？
- It's good to see you, Scotty.
- Who is that?

1413
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:48,448
Khan, Scotty. Scotty, Khan.

1414
01:30:48,698 --> 01:30:49,866
哈喽
Hello.

1415
01:30:50,617 --> 01:30:51,993
他们会知道我们到这里来了
They'll know we're here.

1416
01:30:52,077 --> 01:30:54,037
我知道一条去舰桥的近路
I know the best way to the bridge.

1417
01:30:57,874 --> 01:30:59,542
保险是开着的
It's locked to stun.

1418
01:30:59,793 --> 01:31:01,127
他们的可不会
Theirs won't be.

1419
01:31:01,378 --> 01:31:03,046
尽量别挨枪子儿
Try not to get shot.

1420
01:31:06,132 --> 01:31:08,968
长官，我按你的要求联系上了
Commander, I have that
transmission as requested.

1421
01:31:09,302 --> 01:31:10,970
在屏幕播放，谢谢
On screen, please.

1422
01:31:11,304 --> 01:31:12,472
稍等
Stand by.

1422
01:31:15,304 --> 01:31:18,472
(从未来回到现在的老年Spock，处在另一个平行空间中)

1423
01:31:18,645 --> 01:31:19,979
Spock先生
<i>Mr. Spock.</i>

1424
01:31:21,481 --> 01:31:22,816
Spock先生
Mr. Spock.

1425
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:28,571
将军
Admiral.

1426
01:31:31,533 --> 01:31:32,659
我会处理你这...
I'll deal with you in a...

1427
01:31:35,328 --> 01:31:37,664
我作为你的女儿感到羞耻
I am ashamed to be your daughter.

1428
01:31:41,584 --> 01:31:44,254
长官，我们刚检测到13号甲板舱门打开了
Sir, we just had
a hangar door open on deck 13.

1429
01:31:45,672 --> 01:31:46,840
Khan.

1430
01:31:47,090 --> 01:31:49,342
他们马上就恢复动力了我们却还在瞎逛？
They're going to have
full power and we're walking?

1431
01:31:49,426 --> 01:31:50,593
涡轮升降器很容易被追踪到
The turbolifts are easily tracked

1432
01:31:50,677 --> 01:31:52,095
那样Marcus就会把我们困在那个笼子里
and Marcus would have us in a cage.

1433
01:31:52,178 --> 01:31:54,431
这条小径紧邻引擎室
This path runs adjacent
to the engine room.

1434
01:31:54,514 --> 01:31:56,182
他们知道他们在这使用武器
They know they
won't be able to use their weapons here

1435
01:31:56,266 --> 01:31:57,517
不可避免的会损害跃迁核心
without destabilizing the warp core,

1436
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,019
这就给了我们机会
which gives us the advantage.

1437
01:31:59,102 --> 01:32:01,855
-你从哪找来这个家伙的？ -说来话长了。
- Where'd you find this guy?
- It's a long story.

1438
01:32:02,105 --> 01:32:03,189
我长话短说
<i>I will be brief.</i>

1439
01:32:04,190 --> 01:32:07,527
在你的旅程中，你是否遇见过一个叫Khan的人
In your travels, did you ever
encounter a man named Khan?

1440
01:32:12,115 --> 01:32:13,199
你也知道
<i>As you know,</i>

1441
01:32:13,283 --> 01:32:15,618
我曾起誓不给你任何潜在的
<i>I have made a vow
never to give you information</i>

1442
01:32:15,702 --> 01:32:18,621
可以改变你命运的信息
<i>that could potentially alter your destiny.</i>

1443
01:32:19,539 --> 01:32:24,210
你的路需要你自己去走，只有你自己
<i>Your path is yours to walk,
and yours alone.</i>

1444
01:32:27,881 --> 01:32:29,883
也就是说
<i>That being said,</i>

1445
01:32:31,051 --> 01:32:35,221
Khan Noonien Singh是一个
<i>Khan Noonien Singh is
the most dangerous adversary</i>

1446
01:32:35,305 --> 01:32:37,557
企业号面临的最危险的对手
<i>the</i> Enterprise <i>ever faced.</i>

1447
01:32:38,224 --> 01:32:41,102
他精明，残忍
<i>He is brilliant, ruthless,</i>

1448
01:32:41,311 --> 01:32:43,855
他会毫不犹豫的
<i>and he will not hesitate to kill</i>

1449
01:32:43,897 --> 01:32:45,857
杀死你们所有的人
<i>every single one of you.</i>

1450
01:32:49,569 --> 01:32:51,404
你打败他了吗？
Did you defeat him?

1451
01:32:52,238 --> 01:32:55,575
付出了惨重的代价，不过是的
<i>At great cost. Yes.</i>

1452
01:32:57,577 --> 01:32:58,578
怎么做的？
How?

1453
01:32:58,703 --> 01:33:00,747
我并不想在这里冒险，不过人都哪去了？
I don't mean to tempt fate here,
but where is everybody?

1454
01:33:00,830 --> 01:33:02,540
这艘船被设计成尽量少的船员
The ship is designed
to be flown by minimal crew,

1455
01:33:02,624 --> 01:33:03,667
有必要的话，一个就够了
one, if necessary.

1456
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:05,001
一个？我...
One? I...

1457
01:33:26,272 --> 01:33:28,608
-你没事吧？-是的，Khan哪去了？
- You all right?
- Yeah. Where's Khan?

1458
01:33:34,114 --> 01:33:36,449
上尉，我需要你召集所有高级医疗人员
Lieutenant, I need you to
assemble all senior medical

1459
01:33:36,533 --> 01:33:38,076
和工程师到武器舱
and engineering staff
in the weapons bay.

1460
01:33:38,868 --> 01:33:40,036
好的
All right.

1461
01:33:41,538 --> 01:33:44,708
McCoy医生，你无意间激活了一枚鱼雷
Dr. McCoy, you inadvertently
activated a torpedo.

1462
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:46,042
你可以再做一次吗？
Could you replicate the process?

1463
01:33:46,126 --> 01:33:47,544
我为什么要再做一次
Why the hell would I want to do that?

1464
01:33:47,627 --> 01:33:49,045
你能，还是不能？
Can you or can you not?

1465
01:33:49,129 --> 01:33:51,965
该死，老兄，我是个医生，不是鱼雷专家
Damn it, man, I'm a doctor,
not a torpedo technician!

1466
01:33:52,132 --> 01:33:53,299
就是因为你是一名医生所以
The fact that you
are a doctor is precisely

1467
01:33:53,341 --> 01:33:54,968
我要你非常仔细的听我说
why I need you to listen very carefully.

1468
01:33:56,469 --> 01:33:57,804
他在哪？
Where is he?

1469
01:34:03,309 --> 01:34:04,644
该死
Shit!

1470
01:34:04,978 --> 01:34:06,938
这边
This way.

1471
01:34:09,149 --> 01:34:11,735
我们到舰桥以后，击倒他
The minute we get
to the bridge, drop him.

1472
01:34:11,818 --> 01:34:15,280
什么，击昏他？Khan？我还以为他在帮我们
What, stun him? Khan?
I thought he was helping us.

1473
01:34:15,488 --> 01:34:17,198
我很确定是我们在帮他
I'm pretty sure we're helping him.

1474
01:34:26,416 --> 01:34:27,751
动力恢复了，长官
Power coming online, sir!

1475
01:34:27,917 --> 01:34:30,003
-重新锁定企业号 -是，长官
- Retarget the <i>Enterprise</i> now.
- Aye, sir.

1476
01:34:44,351 --> 01:34:45,685
确保他们被击昏了
Make sure he stays down.

1477
01:34:46,770 --> 01:34:48,104
-抱歉打扰了 -是啊
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

1478
01:34:51,941 --> 01:34:54,277
Marcus将军，你被捕了
Admiral Marcus, you're under arrest.

1479
01:34:54,444 --> 01:34:56,112
你不准备真的这么做吧，真的？
You're not actually
going to do this, are you?

1480
01:34:57,781 --> 01:35:00,033
将军，从座位上下来
Admiral, get out of the chair.

1481
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:02,702
你最好停下来想想你在干什么Kirk
You better stop
and think about what you're doing, Kirk.

1482
01:35:02,869 --> 01:35:04,871
你最好想想你在Kronos做了什么
You better think about
what you did on Kronos.

1483
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:07,582
你入侵了一个敌人的星球
You made an incursion
onto an enemy planet!

1484
01:35:07,957 --> 01:35:09,876
你杀死了Klingon的巡逻队
You killed a Klingon patrol.

1485
01:35:10,043 --> 01:35:13,213
即使你成功的逃跑了，战争就要来了
Even if you got away without
a trace, war is coming.

1486
01:35:13,463 --> 01:35:16,800
那么谁来领导我们？你吗？
And who is going to lead us? You?

1487
01:35:17,133 --> 01:35:18,677
如果我不掌权
If I'm not in charge,

1488
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:21,471
我们就会走向灭亡
our entire way of life is decimated!

1489
01:35:22,138 --> 01:35:24,641
因此如果你想让我走出这艘船
So you want me off this ship,

1490
01:35:24,974 --> 01:35:27,310
你最好杀了我
you better kill me.

1491
01:35:27,477 --> 01:35:29,229
我不打算杀了你，长官
I'm not going to kill you, sir.

1492
01:35:30,397 --> 01:35:34,067
但是我可以朝你开一枪然后把你从那椅子上拽下来
But I could stun your ass
and drag you out of that chair.

1493
01:35:34,317 --> 01:35:36,986
我真不希望在你女儿面前做这些
I'd rather not do that
in front of your daughter.

1494
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:42,742
-你没事吧？ -是的舰长
- You all right?
- Yes, Captain.

1495
01:35:45,286 --> 01:35:46,329
Jim!

1496
01:35:59,592 --> 01:36:01,344
听着！等等！
Listen! Wait!

1497
01:36:13,106 --> 01:36:14,107
你...
You...

1498
01:36:14,607 --> 01:36:17,986
你真不应该把我唤醒的
You should have let me sleep.

1499
01:36:23,283 --> 01:36:24,284
舰长在哪，Sulu先生
Where is the Captain, Mr. Sulu?

1500
01:36:24,617 --> 01:36:26,953
我们探测阵列损坏，长官，我找不到他
Our sensor array's down, sir.
I can't find him.

1501
01:36:28,705 --> 01:36:30,749
我会说的很简单
<i>I'm going to make this
very simple for you.</i>

1502
01:36:30,874 --> 01:36:33,460
-舰长 -你的船员换我的船员
- Captain.<i>
- Your crew for my crew.</i>

1503
01:36:33,626 --> 01:36:34,794
你背叛了我们
You betrayed us.

1504
01:36:35,295 --> 01:36:37,088
你很聪明 Spock先生
<i>You are smart, Mr. Spock.</i>

1505
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:38,548
Spock 别...
<i>Spock don't...</i>

1506
01:36:40,967 --> 01:36:44,137
Spock先生，把我的船员给我
<i>Mr. Spock, give me my crew.</i>

1507
01:36:44,971 --> 01:36:46,556
你得到他们之后会怎么做？
And what will you do
when you get them?

1508
01:36:46,681 --> 01:36:49,142
继续我们被放逐之前的事业
<i>Continue the work we were doing
before we were banished.</i>

1509
01:36:49,267 --> 01:36:51,061
我明白你的事业，关于屠杀
Which, as I understand it,
involves the mass genocide

1510
01:36:51,144 --> 01:36:54,147
那些所有你找到的比你们低等的生命
of any being you find to be
less than superior.

1511
01:36:54,314 --> 01:36:56,316
我可以毁掉你吗Spock先生
<i>Shall I destroy you, Mr. Spock?</i>

1512
01:36:56,649 --> 01:36:59,319
或者你把我想要的给我
<i>Or will you give me what I want?</i>

1513
01:37:01,905 --> 01:37:03,740
我们没有传送的能力了
We have no transporter capabilities.

1514
01:37:03,865 --> 01:37:05,784
很幸运的是我穿上的传送设备完好无损
<i>Fortunately mine are
perfectly functional.</i>

1515
01:37:05,909 --> 01:37:08,078
放下你的护盾
<i>Drop your shields.</i>

1516
01:37:08,495 --> 01:37:10,121
如果我这么做了，我就无法保证
If I do so, I have no guarantee

1517
01:37:10,205 --> 01:37:11,915
你不毁掉企业号
that you will not destroy the <i>Enterprise.</i>

1518
01:37:11,998 --> 01:37:14,501
好吧，咱们就来玩玩逻辑游戏，Spock先生
Well, let's play this out
logically then, Mr. Spock.

1519
01:37:14,584 --> 01:37:16,294
首先，我会杀死你的舰长
Firstly, I will kill your Captain

1520
01:37:16,336 --> 01:37:18,004
来表明我的决心
to demonstrate my resolve.

1521
01:37:18,046 --> 01:37:20,965
然乎如果你坚持不给，那我就别无选择
Then if yours holds,
I will have no choice

1522
01:37:21,007 --> 01:37:23,551
只能杀掉你和你所有船员
but to kill you and your entire crew.

1523
01:37:23,718 --> 01:37:25,387
如果你毁掉我们的飞船
If you destroy our ship,

1524
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:27,472
你也会毁掉你的人
you will also destroy your own people.

1525
01:37:27,597 --> 01:37:30,475
你的船员需要氧气生存，我的不用
Your crew requires oxygen
to survive, mine does not.

1526
01:37:30,517 --> 01:37:32,185
我会瞄准你的生命维持系统
I will target your life support systems

1527
01:37:32,268 --> 01:37:34,437
就在引擎室的后边
located behind the aft nacelle.

1528
01:37:34,646 --> 01:37:37,857
等你们每个人都窒息而死的时候
And after every single person
aboard your ship suffocates,

1529
01:37:37,982 --> 01:37:42,487
我会踩着你冰冷的尸体取回我的人
I will walk over your cold
corpses to recover my people.

1530
01:37:45,031 --> 01:37:46,449
现在
Now,

1531
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:49,202
我们可以开始了吗？
shall we begin?

1532
01:37:53,206 --> 01:37:54,541
放下护盾
Lower shields.

1533
01:37:58,461 --> 01:38:00,422
一个明智的选择，Spock先生
A wise choice, Mr. Spock.

1534
01:38:08,388 --> 01:38:11,141
我看见你的72枚鱼雷仍然在他们的发射管里
I see your 72 torpedoes
are still in their tubes.

1535
01:38:11,558 --> 01:38:13,893
如果他们不是我要的，指挥官，我会知道的
If they are not mine,
Commander, I will know it.

1536
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:16,312
瓦肯人从不撒谎
Vulcans do not lie.

1537
01:38:17,230 --> 01:38:19,399
鱼雷是你的了
The torpedoes are yours.

1538
01:38:30,201 --> 01:38:31,870
谢谢你Spock先生
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

1539
01:38:32,203 --> 01:38:34,372
我履行了你的条件
I have fulfilled your terms.

1540
01:38:34,873 --> 01:38:36,249
现在履行我的吧
Now fulfill mine.

1541
01:38:37,292 --> 01:38:39,252
那么，Kirk
Well, Kirk,

1542
01:38:39,461 --> 01:38:41,629
似乎最好把你还给你的船员了
it seems apt to return you to your crew.

1543
01:38:42,422 --> 01:38:44,049
毕竟
After all,

1544
01:38:46,885 --> 01:38:50,180
没有一艘船是在舰长不在的情况下沉没的
no ship should go down
without her captain.

1545
01:38:52,807 --> 01:38:54,267
他的相位炮正锁定我们长官
He's locking phasers on us, sir!

1546
01:39:00,482 --> 01:39:01,608
我们马上离开这里，现在
Let us out of here now!

1547
01:39:10,825 --> 01:39:12,452
护盾还有6%
Shields at 6 %!

1548
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:14,621
那些鱼雷！还有多少时间，上尉？
The torpedoes!
How much time, Lieutenant?

1549
01:39:14,746 --> 01:39:15,747
12秒，长官
Twelve seconds, sir!

1550
01:39:15,872 --> 01:39:16,956
企业号的船员们
Crew of the <i>Enterprise,</i>

1551
01:39:16,998 --> 01:39:18,458
准备马上到来的冲击波
prepare for imminent
proximity detonation.

1552
01:39:18,917 --> 01:39:20,752
他说什么？什么冲击波？
What's he talking about?
What detonation?

1553
01:39:20,835 --> 01:39:22,921
那些鱼雷，他改装了那些鱼雷
The torpedoes.
He armed the damn torpedoes!

1554
01:39:33,139 --> 01:39:34,140
不！
No!

1555
01:39:41,439 --> 01:39:42,649
长官，他们的武器系统已经被毁坏了
Sir, their weapons
have been knocked out.

1556
01:39:44,109 --> 01:39:46,194
-不赖，指挥官 -谢谢，上尉
- Not bad, Commander.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

1557
01:39:46,569 --> 01:39:48,488
- Bones!
- Bones!

1558
01:39:48,530 --> 01:39:50,657
-护士！-我来了，我来了
- Nurse!
- I got you. I got you.

1559
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:52,867
Marcus博士
Dr. Marcus.

1560
01:39:54,452 --> 01:39:55,537
很高兴见到你，Jim
Good to see you, Jim.

1561
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:57,205
你帮助Spock引爆了那些鱼雷？
You helped Spock
detonate those torpedoes?

1562
01:39:57,288 --> 01:39:58,331
该死的是我干的
Damn right I did.

1563
01:39:58,373 --> 01:39:59,874
他杀死了Khan的船员！
He killed Khan's crew!

1564
01:39:59,958 --> 01:40:01,543
Spock很冷血，不过他还没冷到那个份上
Spock's cold, but he's not that cold.

1565
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:04,004
Khan的船员在我这里
I've got Khan's crew.

1566
01:40:04,129 --> 01:40:06,297
72个冰人
Seventy-two human popsicles

1567
01:40:06,506 --> 01:40:09,009
完好无损的在他们的冷藏柜里
safe and sound in their cryo tubes.

1568
01:40:09,801 --> 01:40:10,927
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

1569
01:40:16,683 --> 01:40:18,518
长官，中央能量栅格在减弱
Sir, the central power grid is failing!

1570
01:40:18,685 --> 01:40:21,855
-切换备用能量 -备用能量失效，长官
- Switch to auxiliary power.
- Auxiliary power failing, sir.

1571
01:40:29,487 --> 01:40:31,364
长官，我们的飞船被地球的重力俘获！
Commander, our ship's
caught in Earth's gravity!

1572
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:33,825
-我们能停下来吗？-我无能为力
- Can we stop?
- I can't do anything.

1573
01:40:43,084 --> 01:40:44,836
抱歉！哦，不
Sorry! Oh, no.

1574
01:40:45,086 --> 01:40:46,212
清场
Clear the area!

1575
01:40:46,921 --> 01:40:49,883
遇到紧急事件！我希望你不晕船
Engage emergency lockdown!
I hope you don't get seasick.

1576
01:40:50,008 --> 01:40:51,885
-你晕船？-是的
- Do you?
- Yeah.

1577
01:40:52,093 --> 01:40:53,636
上尉，拉响警报，所有人员撤离甲板
Lieutenant, sound evacuation, all decks.

1578
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:54,721
是的长官
Aye, sir.

1579
01:40:55,889 --> 01:40:59,559
作为代理舰长，我命令你们弃船
As acting Captain,
I order you to abandon this ship.

1580
01:41:00,852 --> 01:41:02,771
我会留下来转移所有能量
I will remain behind and divert all power

1581
01:41:02,937 --> 01:41:04,314
到生命维持系统和撤离穿梭舱
to life support
and evacuation shuttle bays.

1582
01:41:04,439 --> 01:41:06,066
撤离程序...
<i>Evacuation protocols...</i>

1583
01:41:06,191 --> 01:41:08,693
我命令你们弃船
I order you to abandon the ship!

1584
01:41:08,818 --> 01:41:11,905
恕我直言，长官，我们不会走的
All due respect, Commander,
but we're not going anywhere.

1585
01:41:15,950 --> 01:41:19,079
我就一天不在这船上！就该死的一天
One day I've been off this ship!
One bloody day!

1586
01:41:23,083 --> 01:41:25,335
重力系统失效。抓住，抓住！
Gravity systems are failing.
Hold on! Hold on!

1587
01:41:29,005 --> 01:41:30,674
注意所有甲板人员
<i>Attention, all decks.</i>

1588
01:41:30,757 --> 01:41:32,258
撤离程序启动
<i>Evacuation protocols initiated.</i>

1589
01:41:33,426 --> 01:41:36,179
迅速到安全出口并且到指定的穿梭机报道
<i>Proceed to exit bays
and report to your assigned shuttle.</i>

1590
01:41:36,388 --> 01:41:37,639
没有时间撤离了
There won't be time for evacuation

1591
01:41:37,764 --> 01:41:40,934
如果我们没有足够的能量去稳定这该死的船
if we don't get power
to stabilize the damn ship!

1592
01:41:41,101 --> 01:41:43,603
-我们不能恢复它吗？-只能在轮机室
- Can we restore it?
- Only from engineering.

1593
01:41:43,770 --> 01:41:46,272
我们得去跃迁核心哪里
We have to get back to the warp core.

1594
01:41:49,109 --> 01:41:50,443
Jim?

1595
01:41:51,403 --> 01:41:53,780
Scotty，我们得把能量弄回来！快来！
Scotty, we got to get
the power back on! Come on!

1596
01:42:11,589 --> 01:42:12,924
-Scotty，我们得跳了！-什么？
- Scotty, we got to jump!
- What?

1597
01:42:13,174 --> 01:42:14,426
跳！跳！
Jump! Jump!

1598
01:42:14,551 --> 01:42:16,219
哦，老天
Oh, God.

1599
01:42:16,970 --> 01:42:19,431
紧急能量还有15%而且还在下降
Emergency power at 15 % and dropping.

1600
01:42:19,556 --> 01:42:20,932
请注意，所有甲板人员
<i>Attention, all decks.</i>

1601
01:42:21,016 --> 01:42:23,476
撤离程序启动
<i>Evacuation protocols initiated.</i>

1602
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:27,063
迅速到安全出口并且到指定的穿梭机报道
<i>Proceed to exit bays
and report to your assigned shuttle.</i>

1603
01:42:39,576 --> 01:42:41,119
-Jim？ -坚持住
- Jim?
- Hold on!

1604
01:42:41,327 --> 01:42:42,662
我坚持不住了
I can't.

1605
01:43:01,222 --> 01:43:02,724
我抓住你了，长官
I've got you, Captain!

1606
01:43:02,891 --> 01:43:04,559
-Chekov -别放手
- Chekov.
- Don't let go!

1607
01:43:15,695 --> 01:43:18,406
即使我们把跃迁核心从新启动了，我们仍需要重定向能量
Even if we get the warp core online,
we've still got to redirect the power!

1608
01:43:18,490 --> 01:43:20,116
-他是对的，舰长 -你说的是什么意思？
- He's right, Captain!
- What are you talking about?

1609
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:22,285
得有人去手动操作
Someone has to hit
the manual override.

1610
01:43:22,369 --> 01:43:23,578
小伙子，有这么一个开关...
Laddie, there's a switch...

1611
01:43:23,661 --> 01:43:25,955
在导向面板的后边！我去扳动开关
Behind the deflector dish!
I'll flip the switch!

1612
01:43:26,039 --> 01:43:27,415
我们快出发
Let's go!

1613
01:43:30,377 --> 01:43:31,378
哦，不
Oh, no.

1614
01:43:42,722 --> 01:43:45,517
撤离程序启动
<i>Evacuation protocols initiated.</i>

1615
01:43:45,558 --> 01:43:48,269
迅速到安全出口并且到指定的穿梭机报道
<i>Proceed to exit bays
and report to your assigned shuttle.</i>

1616
01:43:50,146 --> 01:43:52,065
Sulu先生，转移所有剩下的能源到稳定器
Mr. Sulu, divert
any remaining power to stabilizers.

1617
01:43:52,107 --> 01:43:53,942
正在努力，长官，正在努力
Doing what I can, sir. Doing what I can.

1618
01:44:10,333 --> 01:44:13,336
核心偏离了，危险
<i>Core misaligned. Danger.</i>

1619
01:44:13,420 --> 01:44:15,088
-哦，不不，不不！-怎么了？
- Oh, no, no, no, no!
- What?

1620
01:44:15,171 --> 01:44:16,423
核心错位了
The housings are misaligned!

1621
01:44:16,506 --> 01:44:18,425
我们没办法重定向能量了
There's no way
we can redirect the power!

1622
01:44:18,508 --> 01:44:21,511
飞船完蛋了，长官，她要毁了
The ship's dead, sir. She's gone.

1623
01:44:22,929 --> 01:44:24,848
-不，她没有 - 等等Jim
- No, she's not.
- Wait, Jim!

1624
01:44:24,973 --> 01:44:27,475
如果我们进去，我们会死的
If we go in there, we'll die!

1625
01:44:27,559 --> 01:44:29,602
你明白吗？放射物质会杀死我们的
Do you hear me?
The radiation will kill us!

1626
01:44:29,853 --> 01:44:32,105
你在听我说话吗？你在干什么？
Will you listen to me?
What the hell are you doing?

1627
01:44:32,188 --> 01:44:33,356
我在打开这扇门，我要进去
I'm opening the door. I'm going in.

1628
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,650
那扇们是阻挡辐射的
That door is there to stop us
from getting irradiated!

1629
01:44:35,734 --> 01:44:38,028
我们没等爬上去就会死的
We'd be dead
before we made the climb!

1630
01:44:40,447 --> 01:44:41,740
你不用去爬那东西的
You're not making the climb.

1631
01:44:42,949 --> 01:44:45,660
危险，核心错位
<i>Danger. Core misaligned.</i>

1632
01:44:45,744 --> 01:44:48,538
危险，核心错位
<i>Danger. Core misaligned.</i>

1633
01:45:47,681 --> 01:45:49,641
如果我们不能激活能量或者护盾
If we don't get power
or shields back online,

1634
01:45:49,724 --> 01:45:52,352
我们会在返回大气层的时候烧成灰烬
we're gonna be incinerated on re-entry!

1635
01:46:59,085 --> 01:47:00,170
跃迁核心激活了
Warp core is back online!

1636
01:47:00,378 --> 01:47:01,880
推进器最大功率 Sulu先生！
Maximum thrusters, Mr. Sulu!

1637
01:47:07,010 --> 01:47:09,429
推进器已经开到最大！稳住！稳住！
Thrusters at maximum!
Stand by! Stand by!

1638
01:47:36,790 --> 01:47:38,917
-护盾回复 ！-长官，能量回复了
- Shields restored!
- Commander, power online.

1639
01:47:39,209 --> 01:47:41,211
Spock先生，高度已经稳定
Mr. Spock, altitude stabilizing.

1640
01:47:41,544 --> 01:47:43,380
这是个奇迹
It's a miracle.

1641
01:47:45,131 --> 01:47:47,133
根本不可能有奇迹
There are no such things.

1642
01:47:49,552 --> 01:47:50,970
轮机室呼叫舰桥
<i>Engineering to bridge.</i>

1643
01:47:51,054 --> 01:47:52,305
-Spock先生 -Scott先生
<i>- Mr. Spock!</i>
- Mr. Scott.

1644
01:47:52,389 --> 01:47:55,308
长官，你最好亲自来一趟
<i>Sir, you'd better get down here.</i>

1645
01:47:55,392 --> 01:47:56,726
最好快点
<i>Better hurry.</i>

1646
01:48:19,416 --> 01:48:20,500
打开它
Open it.

1647
01:48:20,667 --> 01:48:22,377
净化程序还没有完成
The decontamination process
is not complete.

1648
01:48:22,502 --> 01:48:23,628
你会污染了整个舱的
You'd flood the whole compartment.

1649
01:48:23,753 --> 01:48:25,797
门是锁死的，长官
The door's locked, sir.

1650
01:48:55,285 --> 01:48:56,369
我们的船怎么样了？
How's our ship?

1651
01:48:58,121 --> 01:48:59,622
脱离危险了
Out of danger.

1652
01:49:02,125 --> 01:49:04,377
你救了所有船员
You saved the crew.

1653
01:49:05,795 --> 01:49:08,631
你用他最想得到的东西打败了他
You used what he wanted against him.

1654
01:49:12,635 --> 01:49:14,429
那招真不错
That's a nice move.

1655
01:49:16,139 --> 01:49:18,141
如果是你，也会这么做的
It is what you would have done.

1656
01:49:19,893 --> 01:49:21,144
而且这
And this,

1657
01:49:22,812 --> 01:49:24,814
这也正是你已经做到的
this is what you would have done.

1658
01:49:25,148 --> 01:49:27,317
这是唯一合乎逻辑的做法
It was only logical.

1659
01:49:33,656 --> 01:49:35,367
我害怕了，Spock
I'm scared, Spock.

1660
01:49:39,079 --> 01:49:40,830
帮帮我别让我害怕
Help me not be.

1661
01:49:45,251 --> 01:49:47,587
你是怎么做到不去感觉的
How do you choose not to feel?

1662
01:49:54,344 --> 01:49:56,012
我不知道
I do not know.

1663
01:49:58,682 --> 01:50:00,767
此时此刻我做不到
Right now I am failing.

1664
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:10,527
我想让你知道为什么我不能让你死
I want you to know
why I couldn't let you die.

1665
01:50:14,698 --> 01:50:16,449
为什么我回去找你
Why I went back for you.

1666
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:20,787
因为你是我的朋友
Because you are my friend.

1667
01:51:44,204 --> 01:51:47,207
Khan!

1668
01:51:49,793 --> 01:51:51,127
老天，刚才那可真悬！
God, that was close!

1669
01:51:54,464 --> 01:51:58,677
设定目的地，星际舰队总部！
Set destination, Starfleet Headquarters!

1670
01:51:58,843 --> 01:52:00,095
引擎遭到破坏
<i>Engines compromised.</i>

1671
01:52:00,178 --> 01:52:02,222
无法保证目的地的正确性
<i>Cannot guarantee destination.</i>

1672
01:52:02,305 --> 01:52:03,723
确定命令
<i>Confirm order.</i>

1673
01:52:04,057 --> 01:52:05,308
确定
Confirm.

1674
01:53:09,706 --> 01:53:11,958
检查敌舰生命迹象
Search the enemy ship for signs of life.

1675
01:53:12,208 --> 01:53:14,127
长官，那不可能有人能够幸免
Sir, there's no way anyone survived.

1676
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:16,546
他可以的
He could.

1677
01:53:17,297 --> 01:53:18,381
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

1678
01:53:50,163 --> 01:53:51,748
喔！他刚刚跳了30米远！
Whoa! He just jumped 30 meters!

1679
01:53:51,915 --> 01:53:53,083
我们能把他传送过来吗？
Can we beam him up?

1680
01:53:53,166 --> 01:53:54,167
船体受损严重
There's too much damage.

1681
01:53:54,292 --> 01:53:55,669
我找不到外界的信号
I have no incoming signal.

1682
01:53:55,835 --> 01:53:58,672
不过可以把你传送下去
But it may be possible
to beam you down, sir.

1683
01:53:59,130 --> 01:54:00,382
去抓住他
Go get him.

1684
01:54:05,512 --> 01:54:08,098
-准备坐标 - 是的长官
- Stand by for coordinates.
- Yes, sir.

1685
01:54:08,431 --> 01:54:10,934
输入 3517 乘 2598
Enter 3517 by 2598.

1686
01:54:11,059 --> 01:54:12,852
坐标确定
Coordinates confirmed.

1687
01:55:50,950 --> 01:55:52,786
给我一个冷藏柜，现在！
Get me a cryo tube, now!

1688
01:56:48,591 --> 01:56:50,176
把这个家伙挪出柜子
Get this guy out of the cryo tube.

1689
01:56:50,260 --> 01:56:51,594
保持他的昏迷状态
Keep him in an induced coma.

1690
01:56:51,678 --> 01:56:53,138
我们得把Kirk装进去
We're gonna put Kirk inside.

1691
01:56:53,179 --> 01:56:54,931
这是唯一能够维持他脑部功能正常的方法
It's our only chance to
preserve his brain function.

1692
01:56:55,015 --> 01:56:56,850
Khan的血样还剩下多少了？
How much of Khan's blood is left?

1693
01:56:56,933 --> 01:56:57,934
没有了
None.

1694
01:56:58,852 --> 01:57:01,855
企业号呼叫Spock，Spock！
<i>Enterprise</i> to Spock. Spock!

1695
01:58:02,749 --> 01:58:04,918
激活速冻频率
Activate the cryogenic sequence.

1696
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:08,421
McCoy呼叫舰桥
McCoy to bridge.

1697
01:58:09,047 --> 01:58:11,466
我无法接通Spock，我需要Khan活着
I can't reach Spock. I need Khan alive.

1698
01:58:11,549 --> 01:58:14,719
你要把那个杂种带回到船上来，马上！
You get that son of a bitch
back on board right now!

1699
01:58:15,595 --> 01:58:17,180
我认为他可以救Kirk
I think he can save Kirk.

1700
01:58:17,305 --> 01:58:18,556
我们能把他传送回船上吗？
Can we beam them up to the ship?

1701
01:58:18,598 --> 01:58:21,059
他们不停的移动！我锁定不了其中的任何一个
They keep moving! I can't
get a lock on either of them.

1702
01:58:21,101 --> 01:58:22,435
你能把人传送下去吗？
Can you beam someone down?

1703
01:58:57,387 --> 01:58:58,430
Spock!

1704
01:59:05,979 --> 01:59:06,980
Spock!

1705
01:59:07,272 --> 01:59:09,107
Spock，停下！停下！
Spock, stop! Stop!

1706
01:59:09,691 --> 01:59:11,901
他是我们救Kirk的唯一希望！
He's our only chance to save Kirk!

1707
01:59:21,661 --> 01:59:23,997
-是什么？ -是个男孩
<i>- What is it?
- It's a boy.</i>

1708
01:59:24,330 --> 01:59:25,331
我们就叫他Jim吧
<i>Let's call him Jim.</i>

1709
01:59:25,415 --> 01:59:27,751
你父亲也曾经当了12分钟的舰长
<i>Your father was
captain of a starship for 12 minutes.</i>

1710
01:59:27,834 --> 01:59:31,713
他救了800个生命，我打赌你能做的更好
<i>He saved 800 lives.
I dare you to do better.</i>

1711
01:59:40,889 --> 01:59:43,892
别那么夸张，你距离死亡还差点
Don't be so melodramatic.
You were barely dead.

1712
01:59:44,017 --> 01:59:46,561
这是输血的负面影响
It was the transfusion
that really took its toll.

1713
01:59:46,770 --> 01:59:47,771
你两个星期前才被解冻
You were out cold for two weeks.

1714
01:59:47,854 --> 01:59:48,855
输血？
Transfusion?

1715
01:59:48,938 --> 01:59:51,691
你的细胞被重度辐射，我们没有别的选择
Your cells were heavily irradiated.
We had no choice.

1716
01:59:52,442 --> 01:59:53,693
Khan?

1717
01:59:53,777 --> 01:59:54,944
我们抓到他的时候
Once we caught him,

1718
01:59:55,070 --> 01:59:57,697
我用他的血合成了一种血浆
I synthesized a serum
from his superblood.

1719
01:59:57,781 --> 02:00:00,367
告诉我，你是否有去杀人冲动？
Tell me, are you feeling homicidal?

1720
02:00:00,450 --> 02:00:01,993
对权力的渴望？专制，强暴？
Power mad? Despotic?

1721
02:00:02,202 --> 02:00:03,870
和以往没什么同
No more than usual.

1722
02:00:04,287 --> 02:00:05,455
你怎么抓到他的
How'd you catch him?

1723
02:00:05,872 --> 02:00:07,207
我没有
I didn't.

1724
02:00:16,049 --> 02:00:17,634
你救了我的命
You saved my life.

1725
02:00:17,842 --> 02:00:20,345
Uhura和我也帮了不少忙，你知道吗
Uhura and I had
something to do with it, too, you know.

1726
02:00:21,888 --> 02:00:24,182
你救过我的命，舰长。还有其他...
You saved my life, Captain.
And the lives...

1727
02:00:24,641 --> 02:00:25,975
Spock，别...
Spock, just...

1728
02:00:27,686 --> 02:00:29,020
谢谢
Thank you.

1729
02:00:30,355 --> 02:00:32,524
不客气，Jim
You are welcome, Jim.

1730
02:00:43,326 --> 02:00:46,746
总会有人来侵犯我们
<i>There will always be
those who mean to do us harm.</i>

1731
02:00:48,665 --> 02:00:50,083
去阻止他们
<i>To stop them,</i>

1732
02:00:50,667 --> 02:00:54,587
却要冒险去唤醒我们自身的阴暗面
<i>we risk awakening
the same evil within ourselves.</i>

1733
02:01:00,593 --> 02:01:03,179
我们第一反应就是寻求报复
<i>Our first instinct is to seek revenge</i>

1734
02:01:03,263 --> 02:01:05,598
当我们失去我们至亲的人的时候
<i>when those we love are taken from us.</i>

1735
02:01:08,643 --> 02:01:10,437
但是那并不是我们的本性
<i>But that's not who we are.</i>

1736
02:01:11,938 --> 02:01:13,606
我们今天来到这里
<i>We are here today</i>

1737
02:01:13,732 --> 02:01:16,609
再次为联邦星舰企业号洗礼
<i>to rechristen the</i> U.S.S. Enterprise,

1738
02:01:16,735 --> 02:01:19,571
以慰籍那些逝去的生命
<i>and to honor those who lost their lives</i>

1739
02:01:20,572 --> 02:01:22,198
大约一年前
<i>nearly one year ago.</i>

1740
02:01:22,699 --> 02:01:24,868
当Christopher Pike第一次给我他的飞船的时候
<i>When Christopher Pike
first gave me his ship</i>

1741
02:01:24,951 --> 02:01:27,370
他让我记下舰长誓言
<i>he had me recite the Captain's Oath,</i>

1742
02:01:28,288 --> 02:01:31,124
当时我对这誓言并不了解
<i>words I didn't appreciate at the time.</i>

1743
02:01:31,791 --> 02:01:34,794
现在我看见誓言在召唤我们，提醒我们
<i>Now I see them as a call
for us to remember</i>

1744
02:01:35,628 --> 02:01:37,464
我们曾经是什么样的人
<i>who we once were,</i>

1745
02:01:39,382 --> 02:01:41,801
以后要去做什么样的人
<i>and who we must be again.</i>

1746
02:01:43,053 --> 02:01:44,554
这些誓言就是
<i>And those words?</i>

1747
02:01:45,221 --> 02:01:48,308
宇宙：人类的终极边疆(星际迷航系列剧经典台词)
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

1748
02:01:48,725 --> 02:01:52,479
这是企业号的航程
<i>These are the voyages
of the starship</i> Enterprise.

1749
02:01:53,313 --> 02:01:55,148
她为期五年的任务
<i>Her five-year mission,</i>

1750
02:01:55,231 --> 02:01:57,150
去探索神奇的新世界
<i>to explore strange new worlds,</i>

1751
02:01:57,817 --> 02:02:01,321
去寻找新的生命形式与新文明
<i>to seek out new life
and new civilizations,</i>

1752
02:02:01,988 --> 02:02:05,742
去勇踏前人未至之境
<i>to boldly go where no one has gone before.</i>

1753
02:02:08,745 --> 02:02:10,663
舰长到
Captain on the bridge.

1754
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:16,127
一旦你试过一次就很难戒掉了
It's hard to get out of it
once you've had a taste,

1755
02:02:16,169 --> 02:02:17,671
不是吗Sulu先生？(苏鲁后来做了精进号的舰长)
isn't that right, Mr. Sulu?

1756
02:02:17,754 --> 02:02:20,090
“舰长”确实是个不错的称呼
"Captain" does have a nice ring to it.

1757
02:02:20,173 --> 02:02:21,591
位置是您的了，长官
Chair's all yours, sir.

1758
02:02:23,426 --> 02:02:24,928
Scott先生
Mr. Scott.

1759
02:02:25,095 --> 02:02:26,096
我们的核心怎么样了？
<i>How's our core?</i>

1760
02:02:26,179 --> 02:02:27,806
低沉的隆隆声就像小猫的呼噜，舰长
Purring like a kitten, Captain.

1761
02:02:27,847 --> 02:02:30,183
她已经准备好我们远途的旅程了
She's ready for a long journey.

1762
02:02:30,225 --> 02:02:31,393
太好了
<i>Excellent.</i>

1763
02:02:31,518 --> 02:02:34,020
来吧，Bones！这会很有趣的
Come on, Bones! It's gonna be fun.

1764
02:02:35,271 --> 02:02:38,525
在太空中呆5年，老天救救我吧
Five years in space. God help me.

1765
02:02:38,817 --> 02:02:40,193
Marcus博士
Dr. Marcus.

1766
02:02:41,611 --> 02:02:43,446
我很高兴你能成为我们大家庭的一员
I'm glad you could be
a part of the family.

1767
02:02:43,905 --> 02:02:45,699
有个大家庭真的很好
It's nice to have a family.

1768
02:02:48,034 --> 02:02:49,202
Spock.

1769
02:02:49,369 --> 02:02:50,537
舰长
Captain.

1770
02:02:53,456 --> 02:02:54,958
我们去哪好呢？
Where shall we go?

1771
02:02:56,292 --> 02:02:59,462
为期这么长的任务从未有过
As a mission of this duration
has never been attempted,

1772
02:03:01,464 --> 02:03:03,967
我听从您的安排，舰长
I defer to your good judgment, Captain.

1773
02:03:12,976 --> 02:03:15,562
Sulu先生，我们出发吧
Mr. Sulu, take us out.

1774
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:19,118
