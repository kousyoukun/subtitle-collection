-1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000


1
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:05,127
“尼比鲁 - M级行星”

2
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:35,221
哇靠！那是我们的交通工具耶！
Damn it, man! That was our ride! You just stunned our ride!

3
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,158
你竟然把牠电晕！

4
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,725
怎么不早说
Oh, great.

5
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,424
快跑！
Run!

6
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,071
你到底拿了什么？
What the hell did you take?

7
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,243
不知道，但他们在对着它拜
I have no idea, but they were bowing to it.

8
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,242
寇克呼叫航天飞机一号
Kirk to Shuttle One.

9
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,173
原住民已离开危险区域，地方清空了！
Locals are out of the kill zone.

10
00:01:56,382 --> 00:02:00,011
史巴克，阻止火山活动然后离开这里！
You are clear. Repeat.

11
00:01:56,493 --> 00:02:00,121
Spock, get in there, neutralize the volcano and let's get out of here.

12
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,390
我们得马上行动！
We have to do this now! I told the Captain

13
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,293
我跟舰长说过航天飞机承受不了这种温度
the shuttle wasn't built for this kind of heat.

14
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,793
舰长，原生物种有看到你吗？
Captain, did the indigenous life forms see you?

15
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,727
没有，史巴克，没看到
No, Mr. Spock, they did not.

16
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:16,991
最高指导原则明定
The Prime Directive clearly states

17
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,401
不可干涉外星物种的发展
there can be no interference

18
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:23,639
我知道啊！所以我才变装在丛林奔跑！
with the internal development of alien civilizations.

19
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:22,143
I know what it says! Which is why I'm running

20
00:02:22,227 --> 00:02:23,747
through the jungle wearing a disguise!

21
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:28,312
快把超级冰块丢下去，我们才能离开！
Now drop off your super ice cube and let's go! Kirk out!

22
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,741
你准备好了
You're good.

23
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,541
如果真的要做，就得马上行动！
If we're gonna do this, we've got to do it now!

24
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:34,280
推进器的线圈快被火山灰毁了
This ash is killing our coils.

25
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:35,713
你确定不要我代替你去吗？
You sure you don't want me to go instead?

26
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,957
这样不合逻辑，我已经穿戴…
That would be highly illogical as I am already outfitted...

27
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,782
开玩笑的
Spock, I was kidding.

28
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,792
交给你了    - 不出发就来不及了！
- You got this. - Guys! We have to go! Now!

29
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,141
他们是真的想杀了我们！
They're trying to kill us!

30
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,636
吉姆，他们是真的想杀了我们！
They're trying to kill us, Jim!

31
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,975
90秒后见
I'll see you in 90 seconds.

32
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,418
就是现在！
Do it, do it!

33
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,829
<i>Prerequisite change, 2-7-3...</i>

34
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,767
“引擎过热”
I can't hold this position.

35
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,363
我无法维持位置
Spock, I've got to pull you back up.

36
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,669
史巴克，我得把你拉回来
Negative. This is our only chance to save this species.

37
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,605
不行，这是拯救此物种的唯一机会

38
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,371
如果火山爆发，这个星球就会毁灭
If this volcano erupts, the planet dies.

39
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,352
把他拉回来，马上！
Pull him back up. Now!

40
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,302
<i>史巴克，你还好吗？</i>
<i>Spock, are you okay?</i>

41
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,368
我居然…
I am,

42
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,541
…还活着，请稍候
surprisingly, alive. Stand by.

43
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,714
我们必须去救他，我要换装下去
We have to get him back. I'll suit up. I'm gonna go down.

44
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,141
我们得弃船
We have to abandon the shuttle.

45
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,079
我们不能抛下他！
- We can't just leave him, Sulu! - We don't have a choice!

46
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,081
我们别无选择！
Uhura, I'm sorry.

47
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,819
乌胡拉，对不起

48
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,514
<i>史巴克，我们要先回企业号</i>
Spock, we're going back to the Enterprise.

49
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:16,646
<i>我们会回来救你的</i>
<i>We'll get you out of there.</i>

50
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,550
舰长，我必须放弃航天飞机
Captain, I'm ditching the shuttle.

51
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,181
你们得想办法回企业号
You've got to make it to the Enterprise on your own.

52
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,586
<i>太好了</i>
<i>Wonderful!</i>

53
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:24,362
准备好要游泳了吗？    - 准备好了
- Uhura! You ready to swim? - I'm ready.

54
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:27,685
Jim!

55
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:31,435
吉姆！海滩在那边！
Jim! The beach is that way!

56
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,338
我们没有要去海滩！
I know! We're not going to the beach!

57
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,166
不…不会吧！
Oh, no, no, no!

58
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,103
我讨厌这样！
I hate this!

59
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,505
我知道！
I know you do!

60
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,757
把星舰藏在海底实在是太荒谬了！
Do you have any idea how ridiculous it is

61
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:28,830
to hide a starship on the bottom of the ocean?

62
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,155
还停了一整晚！海水…
We've been down here since last night!

63
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,489
史考特！史巴克呢？
The salt water's gonna ruin the...

64
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,710
Scotty! Where's Spock?

65
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:34,833
还在火山里
Still in the volcano, sir.

66
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,006
舰长抵达舰桥！
Captain on the bridge!

67
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,676
联络得到史巴克先生吗？
Lieutenant, do we have an open channel to Mr. Spock?

68
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,278
热度影响了通讯，但联络上了
The heat's frying his comms, but we still have contact.

69
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,277
史巴克？
Spock?

70
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,815
我已经启动装置了，倒数结束之后
I have activated the device, Captain.

71
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,446
产生的反应会让火山回归到休眠状态
When the countdown is complete,

72
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:31,642
the reaction should render the volcano inert.

73
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,021
到时他也会一睡不起
Yeah, and that's gonna render him inert!

74
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,623
可以使用传送器吗？
Do we have use of the transporters?

75
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:35,861
在这种磁场中不可能
- Negative, sir. - Not with these magnetic fields.

76
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,359
想办法把史巴克传送回来
I need to beam Spock back to the ship.

77
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:39,525
Give me one way to do it.

78
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,793
除非我们飞到火山口的正上方
Maybe if we had a direct line of sight.

79
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,129
这可是活火山耶！如果它爆发…
- If we got closer... - Hold on, wee man!

80
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:44,738
You're talking about an active volcano!

81
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,968
我不保证我们能承受得起那种高温！
Sir, if that thing erupts,

82
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,167
I cannae guarantee we can withstand the heat!

83
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,868
我不觉得能维持那种高度
I don't know that we can maintain that kind of altitude.

84
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,700
航天飞机还能隐藏在灰烬云里
Our shuttle was concealed by the ash cloud,

85
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,141
但企业号太大了
<i>but the Enterprise is too large.</i>

86
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,210
如果你们尝试救援…
If utilized in a rescue effort,

87
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,915
<i>就会让原生物种发现我们的存在</i>
<i>it would be revealed to the indigenous species.</i>

88
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,707
史巴克，没有人比你更了解规则…
Spock, nobody knows the rules better than you,

89
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,648
但凡事必有例外
but there has got to be an exception.

90
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,250
没有，这会违背最高指导原则
None. Such action violates the Prime Directive.

91
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,218
闭嘴，史巴克，我们是想救你！
Shut up, Spock! We're trying to save you, damn it!

92
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,155
多数人的利益胜过少数人的利益
Doctor, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.

93
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,225
史巴克，我们在说的是你的命！
Spock, we're talking about your life!

94
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,564
<i>无论如何都不能打破规定</i>
The rule cannot <i>be</i> broken...

95
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,059
史巴克！
Spock!

96
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,095
快修复通讯
Try to get him back online.

97
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,667
离引爆时间还有90秒
Ninety seconds to detonations.

98
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,740
如果史巴克跟我易地而处
If Spock were here and I were there, what would he do?

99
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,273
他会怎么做？

100
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,906
他会让你死
He'd let you die.

101
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,112
史巴克！
Spock!

102
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,114
你没事吧？
You all right?

103
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,981
你让他们看见我们的星舰了
Captain, you let them see our ship.

104
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,685
他好得很
He's fine.

105
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,786
<i>舰桥呼叫寇克舰长</i>    - 什么事？
<i>- Bridge to Captain Kirk. - Yes, Lieutenant.</i>

106
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,821
史巴克中校上船了吗？
Is Commander Spock on board, sir?

107
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,360
<i>他没事</i>
<i>- Safely</i> and soundly.

108
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,529
请通知他，装置成功启动了
Please notify him that his device

109
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,608
<i>has successfully detonated.</i>

110
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,629
<i>听到没？恭喜你，史巴克</i>
<i>You hear that? Congratulations, Spock.</i>

111
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,966
你刚救了他们的世界
You just saved the world.

112
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,034
舰长，你违反了最高指导原则
You violated the Prime Directive.

113
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,764
被他们看见又有什么了不起
Oh, come on, Spock. They saw us. Big deal.

吉姆，不要理它
Oh, Jim. Come on, let it go.

00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,672
你不会真的要去接吧？
Jim!

124
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:54,775
You're not actually gonna answer that, are you?

125
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,265
“星舰总部 - 旧金山”
Spock, I'm telling you, this is why he called. I can feel it.

126
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,242
我们被选上了，我感觉得到

127
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,443
不管你怎么感觉
Your feeling aside, I consider it highly unlikely

128
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,844
我不认为会选我们出这次任务
that we will be selected for the new program.

129
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,243
不然帕克为什么要找我们？
Why else would Pike want to see us?

130
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,281
他们给了我们最新的船
Forget about seniority.

131
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:10,513
不派我们还能派谁出去？
They gave us the newest ship in the fleet.

132
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,647
我想得到很多人选
I mean, who else are they gonna send out?

133
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,025
史巴克，这是个五年的任务耶！
I can think of numerous possibilities.

134
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,961
A five-year mission, Spock!

135
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,420
在太空深处探险！
That's deep space! That's uncharted territory!

136
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,495
未探索过的地区！那该有多棒
Think how incredible that's gonna be.

137
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,190
妳们好，我是吉姆寇克
Hey, ladies. Jim Kirk.

00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,763
我不想写太多以免浪费你时间
Yes, sir, I didn't want to waste your time going over the details.

141
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,669
谈谈那座火山吧，资料说它很活跃
Tell me more about this volcano.

142
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,210
如果它爆发，会摧毁整个星球
Data says it was highly volatile.

143
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,397
If it were to erupt, it would wipe out the planet.

144
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,674
那希望它不会爆发啰
Let's hope it doesn't, sir.

145
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,938
我有种预感它不会爆发了
Something tells me it won't.

146
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,109
这个嘛…大家对“活跃”的定义不一样
Well, sir, volatile is all relative.

147
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,845
也许资料出了问题
Maybe our data was off.

148
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,782
或是史巴克在火山里引爆冷聚变装置
Or maybe it didn't erupt

149
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,909
because Mr. Spock detonated a cold fusion device

150
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:49,289
然后一个还没发明轮子的文明…
inside it right after a civilization

151
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,580
that's barely invented the wheel

152
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,426
看见星舰从海里飞出来
happened to see a starship rising out of their ocean!

153
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,792
你是这样写的没错吧？
That is pretty much how you describe it, is it not?

154
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,535
你写了报告？怎么不告诉我？
- Admiral... - You filed a report?

155
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:00,303
我以为你舰长日志里会写事实
Why didn't you tell me?

156
00:13:57,922 --> 00:14:00,757
I incorrectly assumed that you would be truthful in your captain's log.

157
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,140
我会啊，如果我不用救你一命的话
Yeah, I would have been if I didn't have to save your life.

158
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:07,004
我很感激你，所以我要把我的行为…
A fact for which I am immeasurably grateful

159
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:05,822
and the very reason I felt it necessary

160
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,340
责任还真重大啊，小尖
to take responsibility for the actions...

161
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,143
你的行动高尚，只会害我背黑锅
Take responsibility, yeah.

162
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:09,849
That'd be so noble, pointy,

163
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,352
if you weren't also throwing me under the bus.

164
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,214
小尖？你是在嘲笑我的…
"Pointy"? Is that a derogatory reference to...

165
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,315
够了
Gentlemen.

166
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,812
星际舰队的任务是探索观察，不是干涉
Starfleet's mandate is to explore and observe, not to interfere.

167
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:23,221
如果顺利，原生物种不会发现我们介入
Had the mission gone according to plan, Admiral,

168
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,279
the indigenous species would never

169
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,894
不要狡辩
have been aware of our interference.

170
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,588
我是瓦肯人，喜欢讨论
That's a technicality.

171
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,742
I am Vulcan, sir. We embrace technicality.

172
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,833
你在耍嘴皮子吗？
Are you giving me attitude, Spock?

173
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,491
我讲了很多话，你指的是哪句？
I'm expressing multiple attitudes simultaneously, sir.

174
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,895
出去
To which are you referring?

175
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:32,957
Out.

176
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,568
中校，你可以走了
You're dismissed, Commander.

177
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,177
你知道你这个人有多麻烦吗？
You have any idea what a pain in the ass you are?

178
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,179
我大概知道，长官
I think so, sir.

179
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,515
那你到底哪里错了？学到什么教训？
So tell me what you did wrong.

180
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,518
What's the lesson to be learned here?

181
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:53,925
永远不要相信瓦肯人
Never trust a Vulcan.

182
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,855
你连这都答不出来，你在报告里说谎
Now, see, you can't even answer the question. You lied.

183
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,088
你认为你不需要遵守这些规则…
On an official report, you lied.

184
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,392
因为你不认同它们
You think the rules don't apply to you

185
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,931
这是你找我入伍的原因
'cause you disagree with them.

186
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,433
这是你给我星舰的原因
That's why you talked me into signing up in the first place.

187
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,796
我把星舰给你，是因为看到你的潜力
It's why you gave me your ship.

188
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:07,992
I gave you my ship because I saw a greatness in you.

189
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,501
但现在的你是如此的傲慢
And now, I see you haven't got an ounce of humility.

190
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,440
那我该让史巴克去死？    - 你搞错重点
What was I supposed to do, let Spock die?

191
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,508
换成是你会怎么样？
You're missing the point.

192
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:15,749
I don't think I am, sir. What would you have done?

193
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,817
我根本不会让我的大副去冒险！
I wouldn't have risked my First Officer's life

194
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:22,882
你是去观察这个星球不是改变它的命运
in the first place!

195
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:21,088
You were supposed to survey a planet,

196
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,007
not alter it's destiny!

197
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:27,285
你违反了一堆规定，差点害死全船的人
You violated a dozen Starfleet regulations

198
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,428
and almost got everyone under your command killed.

199
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,221
可是我没有！我没有损失任何船员…
Except I didn't!

200
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,556
这就是你的问题，你以为你永远是对的
You know how many crew members I've lost? Not one!

201
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,474
That's your problem, you think you're infallible!

202
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:36,130
以为规则是给别人用的
You think you can't make a mistake.

203
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,060
It's a pattern with you!

204
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,402
有些规则是这样
- The rules are for other people! - Some should be.

205
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,300
你还用好运去合理化自己的上帝情结
And what's worse is you using blind luck

206
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,358
to justify your playing God!

207
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,636
这件事已经引起马可士上将的注意
Given the circumstances,

208
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:47,905
this has been brought to Admiral Marcus's attention.

209
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,474
他召开了一个我不能参加的裁决会议
He convened a special tribunal, to which I was not invited.

210
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,582
你也知道星际舰队会怎么做
You understand what Starfleet regulations mandate

211
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:54,705
be done at this point.

212
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,656
他们解除了你对企业号的指挥权
<i>They've</i> taken <i>the Enterprise</i> away <i>from</i> you.

213
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,019
要把你送回星舰学院
They're sending you back to the Academy.

214
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,201
上将，听我说…
Admiral, listen...

215
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:14,461
为什么要我听？除了自己，你谁也不听
- No, I'm not going to listen. - I can justify...

216
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:12,514
Why should I listen? I'm not going to listen.

217
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:13,766
You don't listen to anybody but yourself!

218
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:15,767
我的每个决定…
I understand regulation, but every decision I've made...

219
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:16,704
不！我不要听！
No! I can't listen!

220
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,536
你不遵守规定，你也不负责任
You don't comply with the rules,

221
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:20,731
you don't take responsibility for anything,

222
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,814
你根本不尊敬舰长这个职位
and you don't respect the chair.

223
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,384
你知道为什么吗？
You know why?

224
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,383
因为你还没准备好
Because you're not ready for it.

你怎么找到我的？
How did you find me?

233
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,859
我比你想象中更了解你
I know you better than you think I do.

234
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,794
最开始我就是在这种地方找到你
The first time I found you was in a dive like this.

235
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,831
还记得吗？你被痛殴的那次
Remember that? You got your ass handed to you.

236
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,170
没有吧
No, I didn't.

237
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,997
没有？    - 事情不是你说的那样
- You don't? - No, that's not what happened.

238
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,502
你被打得超惨的    - 才没有
- That was an epic beating. - No, it wasn't.

239
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,675
你鼻孔里还塞着卫生纸
You had napkins hanging out of your nose.

240
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,678
有没有？
Did you not?

241
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,916
那次真的打得很爽
Yeah, that was a good fight.

还爽咧
"A good fight."

243

I think that's your problem right there.

Yeah, Marcus took some convincing.

253
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,968
但我有时也能想到好论点
But every now and then I can make a good case.

你怎么说的？
What did you tell him?

255
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,002
说实话
The truth.

00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,138
我说我相信你

It is fortunate that the consequences

were not more severe.

Not Captain.

你写一份报名，我的船就没了
You wrote a report, I lost my ship.

to the fact that I submitted the report.

No, I'm familiar with your compulsion

to follow the rules. But you see, I can't do that.

00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,829
如果有人救我一命，我绝不会背叛他
Where I come from, if someone saves your life,

281
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,464
瓦肯人没办法说谎
you don't stab him in the back.

282
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,746
Vulcans cannot lie.

283
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,464
我是在跟你人类的那一半血统说话
Then I'm talking to the half-human part of you.

284
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,503
你知道为什么我会回去救你吗？
All right?

285
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,710
Do you understand why I went back for you?

286
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,207
史巴克中校？
Commander Spock? Frank Abbot, <i>U.</i> S. S. Bradbury.

287
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,141
星舰布莱伯利号，艾伯特舰长

288
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:01,742
看来你要跟着我了
Guess you're with me.

289
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,979
是的，舰长
Yes, Captain.

290
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,249
老实说…
The truth is

291
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,627
我会想你的
I'm going to miss you.

292
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:28,303
<i>马可士上将，请</i>
<i>Admiral Marcus, sir.</i>

293
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:32,243
谢谢你们这么快就赶来
Thank you for convening on such short notice.

294
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:33,738
请坐
Be seated.

295
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,515
我想有些人已听说伦敦的攻击事件
By now, some of you have heard what happened in London.

296
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,011
攻击目标是舰队数据库
The target was a Starfleet data archive.

297
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,849
现在变成一个大洞，死了42个人
Now it's a damned hole in the ground,

298
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:44,174
42 men and women are dead.

299
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:47,257
一小时前，我收到一个讯息
One hour ago,

300
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:47,435
I received a message from a Starfleet officer,

301
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:51,929
有个舰队军官坦承犯案，说是被逼的
who confessed to carrying out this attack,

302
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:52,182
that he was being forced to do it by this man,

303
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:55,164
逼他的是约翰哈里森中校，自己人
Commander John Harrison. He's one of our own.

304
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:58,265
他要为这个恐怖行为负责
And he is the man responsible for this act of savagery.

305
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:03,597
不知为何，约翰哈里森对星际舰队宣战
For reasons unknown, John Harrison has just declared

306
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,610
a one-man war against Starfleet.

307
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:09,136
我们绝对不能让他逃出联邦领域
And under no circumstances are we to allow this man

308
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:09,157
to escape Federation space.

309
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:13,440
你们是本区域所有的星舰高阶将领
You here tonight represent the senior command

310
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,411
of all the vessels in the region.

311
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:18,482
为了给死者交代，你们要找出这个混蛋
And in the name of those we lost,

312
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,500
you will run this bastard down.

313
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:22,818
这是个搜捕行动，开始吧
This is a manhunt, pure and simple, so let's get to work.

314
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:28,188
没有离开地球的曲速讯号，他还在这
Earth's perimeter sensors have not detected

315
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,967
any warp signatures leaving the system,

316
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,343
so we know he can't be far.

317
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,695
你们的船要维持封锁队形
You will park your ships in a blockade formation

318
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:36,363
然后派出搜索船和登陆队去追查
then deploy search vehicles and landing parties

319
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:37,102
to run down every lead.

320
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,940
这个人残杀无辜百姓
This man has shown willingness to kill innocent people,

321
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,379
所以交战法则很简单
so the rules of engagement are simple.

322
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:46,376
遇到他时，如果怕自己或旁人受伤
If you come across this man and fear for your life

323
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,653
or the lives of those nearby,

324
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:49,549
可以选择使用致命武力
you are authorized to use deadly force on sight.

325
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,412
袋子装了什么东西？    - 先别吵
- What's in the bag? - James, not now.

326
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:55,181
攻击数据库很怪吧？就像去炸图书馆
It doesn't seem odd to you that he'd target an archive?

327
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,412
It's like bombing a library.

328
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,027
克里斯？你没事吧？
Chris? Everything okay there?

329
00:24:57,295 --> 00:25:01,755
没事，寇克只是不适应自己的新职位
Yes, sir. Mr. Kirk is just acclimating

330
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,043
to his new position as First Officer.

331
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:05,500
寇克，你有什么想法就说吧，集思广益
You got something to say, Kirk, say it.

332
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,505
Tomorrow's too late.

333
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:08,669
我没有意见，对不起
I'm fine, sir. My apologies.

334
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,605
说吧，别害羞
Spit it out, son. Don't be shy.

335
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,946
为什么要攻击数据库？
Why the archive?

336
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,712
信息是公开的，如果他想伤害星际舰队
All that information is public record.

337
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,853
If he really wanted to damage Starfleet,

338
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,554
这恐怕只是个开始而已
this could just be the beginning.

339
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,119
什么的开始？
The beginning of what, Mr. Kirk?

340
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:28,051
受到攻击时，程序规定要求…
Sir, in the event of an attack, protocol mandates

341
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:33,286
舰长和大副必须到总部集合…
that senior command gather captains and first officers

342
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,283
at Starfleet H.Q., right here

343
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:35,800
…到这个房间
- in this room. - It is curious Harrison

344
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,629
哈里森抢没有曲速引擎的小艇也很怪
would commandeer a jumpship without warp capabilities...

345
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:46,110
快离开这里！
Clear the room!

346
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:52,469
Woman, No!

347
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:57,148
快派出空中防卫小组！德斯仲会议室！
We need an air defense team! Daystrom Conference Room!

348
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:00,477
- Let's go! - Cover me!

349
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:10,654
- Target acquired. - Take him out!

350
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:11,780
Watch my flank!

351
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,636
快走，快走！
- Go, go, go! - Cover me!

352
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:00,549
开火！
Guard 13 Fire!

353
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:28,359
<i>中校，史考特在小艇的残骸有发现</i>
Yeah?

354
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:26,409
<i>Commander, Mr. Scott has found something</i>

355
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:28,369
<i>in the wreckage of Harrison's ship.</i>

356
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:31,024
<i>他要求我们立刻过去</i>
<i>He has asked to see us right</i> away.

357
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,858
在坠毁的小艇找到的，他是用这逃走的
Captain! I found this in the crashed jumpship, sir.

358
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:37,999
什么玩意？
- This is how the bastard got away. - What do you mean?

359
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:39,694
携带式超曲速传送器
It's a portable transwarp beaming device.

360
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,235
你知道他到哪里去了吗？
Well, can you figure out where he went?

361
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:44,201
我查过了，但你不会想知道的
I already did, sir. And you're no gonna like it.

362
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:47,170
他跑到唯一一个…
He's gone to the one place we...

363
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,576
…我们不能去的地方
We just can't go.

364
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,415
上将，他不在地球上了
Admiral, sir, he's not on Earth.

365
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,851
他在克罗诺斯
He's on Kronos, sir.

366
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:02,085
我要求恢复指挥职权，并允许我去抓他
I request my command be reinstated

367
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:02,111
and your permission to go after him.

368
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:04,754
你们先走吧
Give us a minute.

369
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,222
- 克罗诺斯？    - 是的，长官
- Kronos. - Yes, sir.

370
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:10,467
哈里森跑去克林贡人母星，想要投诚？
So Harrison's gone to the Klingon homeworld.

371
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:11,569
我们不确定
- Is he defeating? - We're not sure, sir.

372
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,967
他躲在克莎省，那里没有人住
He has taken refuge in the Ketha Province,

373
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,739
他一定是想躲在那里
a region uninhabited for decades.

374
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:15,875
He's gotta be hiding there, sir!

375
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,532
他知道我们进入克林贡领空会引起战争
He knows if we even go near Klingon space,

376
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,975
星际舰队不能去追他，我可以单独去
it'd be all-out war.

377
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:21,130
Starfleet can't go after him, but I can.

378
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,243
拜托，长官
Please, sir.

379
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,078
已经无法避免和克林贡人开战
All-out war with the Klingons is inevitable, Mr. Kirk.

380
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:29,483
其实我觉得早就打起来了
If you ask me, it's already begun.

381
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:33,416
自从知道他们的存在，克林贡帝国…
Since we first learned of their existence,

382
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:33,560
the Klingon Empire has conquered and occupied

383
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:37,252
已经占领了两个星球，还常攻击我们
two planets that we know of

384
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:37,438
and fired on our ships half a dozen times.

385
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,057
他们一定会打来的
They are coming our way.

386
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,961
伦敦遇袭的不是数据库
London was not an archive.

387
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:49,466
是极机密的星舰分部，称为31区
It was a top-secret branch of Starfleet

388
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,742
designated Section 31.

389
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:53,174
他们在发展防卫科技，训练人员…
They were developing defense technology

390
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:53,371
and training our officers to gather intelligence

391
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:56,641
并搜集克林贡和其它潜在敌人的情报
on the Klingons and any other potential enemy

392
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:57,292
who means to do us harm.

393
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:58,713
哈里森本来是我们最优秀的探员
Harrison was one of our top agents.

394
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,148
他现在却是逃犯，我想解决他
Well, now he's a fugitive and I want to take him out.

395
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,650
帕克一直说你是最优秀的人才
Pike always said you were one of our best and brightest.

396
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,486
你真该听听他是怎么帮你辩护的
You should have heard him defend you.

397
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,655
是他召募你加入舰队，对吧？
He's the one who talked you into joining Starfleet, wasn't he?

398
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:13,923
是的
Yes, sir.

399
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,795
那他有没有说是谁召募他的？
Did he ever tell you who talked him into joining?

400
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,940
是我害死他的
His death is on me.

401
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:25,609
我不能再害你
And yours can't be.

402
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:29,843
史巴克，你说哈里森躲在荒芜地区？
Sir, please. All I...

403
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:28,531
Mr. Spock, you said the province

404
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,115
是的
where Harrison is hiding is uninhabited?

405
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:31,659
Affirmative, sir.

406
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,210
31区研发出了一种…
As part of our defensive strategy,

407
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:38,845
…新型防卫用光子鱼雷
31 developed a new photon torpedo.

408
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:45,121
射程远、无法追踪，克林贡人侦测不到
Long-range and untraceable,

409
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:45,298
it would be invisible to Klingon sensors.

410
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:48,194
你可以去解决他，但不能冒险
I don't want you hurt, but I want to take him out.

411
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:52,128
在中立区边缘锁定哈里森的位置
You park on the edge of the Neutral Zone,

412
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:52,472
you lock onto Harrison's position,

413
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:55,133
用鱼雷杀了他，然后马上离开
you fire, you kill him and you haul ass.

414
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:58,634
请让史巴克重新担任我的大副
Permission to reinstate Mr. Spock as my First Officer.

415
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,378
同意
Granted.

416
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,044
吉姆！
Jim!

417
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,984
你跑哪去了？    - 怎么了？
- Where were you? - For what?

418
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:17,489
你要做身体检查，你才刚经历枪战
Your medical exam.

419
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:16,913
Ten hours ago, you were in a damn firefight.

420
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,059
老骨头，我很好
- Now it's my duty as ship's... - I'm fine, Bones.

421
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,795
好个屁
The hell you are.

422
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:24,164
我真的没事
I'm fine.

423
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:31,575
史巴克，进度报告
Status report, Mr. Spock.

424
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,908
企业号等我们到就可以出发
<i>The Enterprise should be</i> ready <i>for</i> launch

425
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,098
by the time we arrive.

426
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,246
很好
- Good. Good. - Captain.

427
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,345
舰长

428
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,684
谢谢你提出我的复职请求
Thank you for requesting my reinstatement.

429
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:43,583
不客气
You're welcome.

430
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:48,355
身为大副，我必须反对这次任务的规范
As I am again your First Officer, it is now my duty

431
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:48,661
to strongly object to our mission parameters.

432
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,927
老样子，不意外
Of course it is.

433
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:53,097
按规定不能跳过审判直接处决嫌犯
There is no Starfleet regulation

434
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:53,323
that condemns a man to die without a trial,

435
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,864
你和马可士上将都忘了这点
something you and Admiral Marcus are forgetting.

436
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:59,934
而且无故对克林贡母星发射鱼雷违反…
Also, preemptively firing torpedoes

437
00:33:58,413 --> 00:33:59,974
at the Klingon homeworld goes against...

438
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:02,868
那里什么都没有，只会死一个人
You yourself said the area's uninhabited.

439
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,233
There's only gonna be one casualty.

440
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:06,602
我们的命令也和舰队规定无关
And in case you weren't listening,

441
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:06,786
our orders have nothing to do with Starfleet regulation.

442
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,403
我们要用鱼雷射克林贡人？
Wait a minute. We're firing torpedoes at the Klingons?

443
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:11,281
先不管规定，我们做的事很不道德
Regulations aside, this action is morally wrong.

444
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:14,210
不管规定，把你从火山救出来才是对的
Regulations aside, pulling your ass out of a volcano was morally right.

445
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:15,512
但我做了你却没有称赞我
And I didn't win any points for that.

446
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:16,551
冷静点
Whoa, Jim, calm down.

447
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,212
我不必让机器人帮我上道德课
I'm not gonna take ethics lessons from a robot!

448
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:21,323
嘲笑我是防卫心态，证明我说的是对的
Reverting to name-calling suggests that you are defensive

449
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:25,118
我没问你的意见，把那鬼东西拿开
and therefore find my opinion valid.

450
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:22,840
I wasn't asking for your opinion.

451
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:25,064
Bones, get that thing off my face.

452
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:29,557
这任务可能让我们开战，而且还不道德
Captain, our mission could start a war with the Klingons

453
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:29,986
and it is, by it's very definition, immoral.

454
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:33,893
你可以仔细想想，就知道我是对的
Perhaps you should take the requisite time

455
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:34,073
to arrive at this conclusion for yourself.

456
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,298
寇克舰长
Captain Kirk.

457
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:40,405
我是瓦勒丝，马可士上将派我当科学官
Science Officer Wallace.

458
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:40,455
I've been assigned to the Enterprise by Admiral Marcus.

459
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,403
这是我的调职令
These are my transfer orders.

460
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:45,241
你有要求多一个科学官吗？
You requested an additional science officer, Captain?

461
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,474
我真希望我有
I Wish I had.

462
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,313
卡萝瓦勒丝上尉
"Lieutenant Carol Wallace."

463
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:54,580
应用物理博士，精通先进武器
"Doctorate in applied physics"

464
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:54,927
"specializing in advanced weaponry."

465
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:55,917
蛮厉害的
Impressive credentials.

466
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:57,425
谢谢
Thank you.

467
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,052
但我回来就没这必要了
But redundant now that I am back aboard the Enterprise.

468
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,595
人多比较好办事
And yet, the more the merrier.

469
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,028
请坐，博士
- Have a seat, Doctor. - Thank you.

470
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,198
各位乘客，准备起飞
Shuttle crew, stand by for lift-off.

471
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,389
不可能！别想要我签名！
No! I'm not signing anything!

472
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:33,497
把那鬼东西拿走！
Now, get these bloody things off my ship! Captain!

473
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,231
史考特，有问题吗？    - 有
Is there a problem, Mr. Scott?

474
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:40,493
我刚告诉他，我不会让不明物体上船的
Aye, sir. I was just explaining to this gentleman

475
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,680
that I cannae authorize any weapons on board this ship

476
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:43,740
史考特说的···    - 去舰桥报到
without knowing what's inside them.

477
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:42,767
Mr. Scott raises yet another point...

478
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,075
舰长
Report to the bridge.

479
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:49,072
我知道你担心，但我们需要那些鱼雷
Captain.

480
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:47,355
Mr. Scott, I understand your concerns,

481
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:49,315
but we need these torpedoes on board.

482
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,678
光子鱼雷也要靠燃料推进
Due respect, sir, but photon torpedoes run on fuel.

483
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:54,417
我不知道它们用什么燃料
Now, I cannae detect the type of fuel

484
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,349
因为全被力场包覆
that's in the compartments on these torpedoes

485
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:58,919
我跟他要详细资料，他却说…
because it's shielded.

486
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:59,075
Now, I asked for the specifications, but he said...

487
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:00,815
这是机密
- it's classified. - It's classified.

488
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,189
所以我说没数据就不签名！
So I said, "No specs, no signature!"

489
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:04,261
舰长
Captain.

490
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:06,763
飞行检查完毕，可以出发了
Flight check's complete. We're good to go, sir.

491
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:08,429
谢谢，苏鲁
- Thank you, Mr. Sulu. - Yes, sir.

492
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,768
如果没别的事，我还要去调整曲速核
Now if you'll excuse me, sir, I have a warp core to prime.

493
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:13,529
你给我下来！
Get down!

494
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,101
你的身体读数不对劲
Jim, your vitals are way off.

495
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,604
你去医疗室报到，史考特！
Report to the med bay. Scotty!

496
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:19,435
你一定要签收那些武器才行
I need you to approve those weapons.

497
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:21,870
你猜那是什么？    - 我没空听你说教
Do you know what this is, Captain?

498
00:36:20,638 --> 00:36:22,056
I don't have time for a lecture, Scotty.

499
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,374
你知不知道那是什么？
- Do you know what this is? - It's a warp core.

500
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:24,607
是曲速核

501
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:27,885
那随时会变成一场放射性灾难
It's a radioactive catastrophe waiting to happen.

502
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:30,382
磁场只要有一点点变化
A subtle shift in magnetic output

503
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,786
譬如说像是发射几十颗…
from, say, firing one or more of six dozen torpedoes

504
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,454
…内容不明的鱼雷
with an unknown payload

505
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,728
都可能引起连锁反应杀死船上所有人
could set off a chain reaction which would kill

506
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:37,947
every living thing on this ship.

507
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:40,395
让那鬼东西上船就是最后一根稻草！
Letting those torpedoes on board the Enterprise is the last straw!

508
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:42,292
那第一根稻草是什么？    - 啥？
- What was the first straw? - What was the...

509
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,227
稻草多的是
There are plenty of straws.

510
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,735
像舰队没收我的超曲速研究
How about Starfleet confiscating my transwarp equation?

511
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:49,973
却被狂人用来到处逃窜，是谁给他的？
And now some madman's using it to hop across the galaxy!

512
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:51,801
史考特，那是我们的命令！
Where do you think he got it from?

513
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:53,736
这才是我最怕的
We have our orders, Scotty!

514
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:53,921
That's what scares me.

515
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,476
这显然是一个军事行动
This is clearly a military operation.

516
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:58,212
怎么会变成这样？
Is that what we are now?

517
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,647
我以为我们是探险家
'Cause I thought we were explorers.

518
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:03,048
签收那些鱼雷，这是命令
Sign for the torpedoes, that's an order.

519
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:07,224
那我只能辞去职务
Right, well, you leave me no choice

520
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:08,788
史考特，别这样
but to resign my duties.

521
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:09,103
Come on, Scotty.

522
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,890
我别无选择    - 我也没有…
You're giving me no choice, sir. I will not stand by...

523
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,023
You're not giving me much of a choice.

524
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,623
你接不接受我的辞职？
Will you just make an exception and sign...

525
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:15,956
接受
Do you accept my resignation or not?

526
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:16,152
Idol

527
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,570
我接受
I do.

528
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:27,811
史考特，你的职务解除了
You are relieved, Mr. Scott.

529
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:38,814
吉姆
Jim, for the love of God, do not use those torpedoes.

530
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:43,320
我求求你，不要用那些鱼雷

531
00:37:55,024 --> 00:37:56,108
Attention.

532
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:59,111
<i>Warp core anti-matter containment check</i>

533
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:00,655
<i>in three minutes.</i>

534
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,840
<i>舰长，我很遗憾帕克上将死了</i>
<i>Captain! I'm so sorry about Admiral Pike.</i>

535
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:08,515
我们都很难过
We all are.

536
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:11,121
你还好吗？    - 我很好，谢谢
- Are you okay? - Fine, thank you, Lieutenant.

537
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,190
史考特刚才辞职了
Actually, Scotty just quit.

538
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:26,193
你的男朋友又找各种机会质疑我
And your boyfriend's second-guessing me every chance he gets.

539
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,967
对不起，我不该讲这种话
I'm sorry, that was inappropriate.

540
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:34,871
有时我真想把他的浏海扯下来
It's just sometimes I want to rip the bangs off his head.

541
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,306
大概是我的问题
- You know, maybe it's me. I... - It's not you.

542
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:38,707
不是你的问题

543
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,479
不是我？
It's not?

544
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:46,852
你们吵架了？    - 我不是很想谈…
Wait, are you guys... Are you guys fighting?

545
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:49,049
和他吵得起来吗？
I'd rather not talk about it, sir.

546
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:49,078
Oh, my God! What is that even like?

547
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:55,999
你耳朵痒了吗？
Your ears burning?

548
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,724
舰长抵达舰桥！
Captain on the bridge!

549
00:38:57,712 --> 00:38:59,005
Captain.

550
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:02,370
契可夫，你常跟着史考特
Mr. Chekov. You've been shadowing Mr. Scott.

551
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,098
你熟不熟轮机系统？    - 很熟
You are familiar with the engineering systems of this ship?

552
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,377
很好
Affirmative, sir.

553
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:07,388
Good.

554
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,048
你是新的轮机长了，去找件红衣服穿
You're my new Chief. Go put on a red shirt.

555
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:16,052
是，舰长
Aye, Captain.

556
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:21,724
苏鲁，收回所有的固定器
Retract all moorings, Mr. Sulu.

557
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,954
是，长官
Yes, sir.

558
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:30,767
<i>停泊钳 1、2、3 号已解开</i>
<i>Docking clamps one, two, and three are released.</i>

559
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:31,932
<i>所有的固定器已收回</i>
<i>All moorings retracted.</i>

560
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,411
乌胡拉，准备全船广播
Lieutenant Uhura, open a shipwide channel.

561
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:45,634
Yes, sir.

562
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,777
<i>契可夫，系统怎么样？</i>
<i>Mr. Chekov, how we looking down there?</i>

563
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,143
所有系统正常    - <i>收到</i>
- All systems nominal, Captain. - Copy <i>that.</i>

564
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:51,751
曲速准备就绪
Warp available at your command.

565
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,580
<i>谢谢你，契可夫</i>
<i>Thank you, Mr. Chekov.</i>

566
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,082
我们出发吧    - 是，长官
- All right. Let's ride. - Yes, sir.

567
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,239
频道打开了
Channel open, sir.

568
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:14,136
企业号全体船员请注意
Attention, crew of the Enterprise.

569
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:18,239
前任舰长和我们的朋友
As most of you know, Christopher Pike,

570
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,646
克里斯托弗帕克
former captain of this ship and our friend,

571
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:22,751
…已经过世
is dead.

572
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:27,249
杀死他的人躲在克林贡母星
The man who killed him has fled our system

573
00:40:25,758 --> 00:40:27,510
and is hiding on the Klingon homeworld,

574
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,993
<i>他以为我们不敢过去</i>
<i>somewhere he believes we are unwilling to go.</i>

575
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,487
<i>我们现在就去讨伐他</i>
<i>We are on our way there now.</i>

576
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:38,190
<i>马可士上将有令，不能曝露行踪</i>
<i>Per Admiral Marcus, it is essential that our presence go undetected.</i>

577
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:41,499
<i>联邦和克林贡人的关系已经很紧张</i>
<i>Tensions between the Federation</i>

578
00:40:40,022 --> 00:40:41,690
<i>and the Klingon Empire have been high.</i>

579
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:44,001
<i>任何挑衅都可能引起星际战争</i>
<i>Any provocation could lead to an all-out war.</i>

580
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:02,351
我会亲自带队到克罗诺斯的废弃城市
I will personally lead a landing party

581
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:02,545
to an abandoned city on the surface of Kronos

582
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,357
逮捕逃犯约翰哈里森
where we will capture the fugitive, John Harrison,

583
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:10,530
把他带回地球接受制裁
and return him to Earth so he can face judgment for his actions.

584
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:16,871
我们去抓这混蛋吧，通话完毕
All right. Let's go get this son of a bitch. Kirk out.

585
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:24,712
舰长，你的决定很正确
Captain, I believe you have made the right decision.

586
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:27,880
我很乐意加入特遣队协助你
If I can be of assistance,

587
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,903
I would be happy to accompany you on the away team.

588
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,552
你很乐意？
You? Happy?

589
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,484
我只是想用你惯用的语气表示肯定
I was simply attempting to use your vernacular to convey an idea.

590
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,222
谢谢你，史巴克
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

591
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:51,177
<i>All personnel, prepare for the closing of payload bay doors.</i>

592
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:00,943
史巴克，你吓我一跳
Mr. Spock. You startled me.

593
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,386
你来做什么的？
What are you doing, Doctor?

594
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,383
我来检查这些鱼雷···    - 你误会了
- Verifying that the torpedo's internal... - You misunderstand.

595
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:10,286
我是问你上船做什么？我查不到调职令
What are you doing aboard this ship?

596
00:42:07,818 --> 00:42:10,654
There is no record of you being assigned to the Enterprise.

597
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:11,787
一定是出了什么差错
Really? That must be some sort of mistake.

598
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:14,462
我也这么想，马可士博士
My conclusion as well, Dr. Marcus.

599
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,894
你隐瞒了自己真实身分
Except that you have lied about your identity.

600
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:22,901
瓦勒丝是你妈妈的姓，我猜你爸是上将
Wallace is the surname of your mother.

601
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:23,042
I can only assume the Admiral is your father.

602
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:27,640
史巴克
Mr. Spock.

603
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:30,738
我知道我没资格要求你
I'm aware that I have no right to ask this of you.

604
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:34,143
但你不能让他知道我在这…
But please, he cannot know that I'm here...

605
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:43,660
是轮机室那边让我们退出曲速
Engineering manually dropped us out of warp, sir.

606
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:45,656
契可夫，你把我的船弄坏了吗？
Mr. Chekov, did you break my ship?

607
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:48,431
我不知道怎么回事！核心过热了
Sorry, sir. I don't know what happened!

608
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,223
我非紧急停止不可
The core overheated.

609
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,097
可能是冷却剂在漏
I had to activate the emergency stop.

610
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:52,238
It must be a coolant leak. I need time to find it.

611
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:54,496
<i>对不起</i>    - 该死
<i>- Sorry, Captain. - Damn it.</i>

612
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,931
苏鲁，我们还距离多远？
Mr. Sulu, time to our destination.

613
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:58,572
还有20分钟航程
Twenty minutes, sir.

614
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,473
我们现在在敌人领空
That's 20 minutes in enemy space we weren't counting on.

615
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:02,744
我们得快点，史巴克呢？
All right. We better hop to it.

616
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:03,813
我在这
- Where's Spock? - Here, Captain.

617
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:06,149
你和我一起去克罗诺斯
You're coming with me to Kronos.

618
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:07,716
上尉，你克林贡语行吗？
Lieutenant, how's your Klingon?

619
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:08,749
很久没说但还好
- It's rusty, but it's good. - Good, you're coming, too.

620
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,251
好，那你也来

621
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:12,849
你们两个一起去不会怎么样吧？
This isn't going to be a problem, is it, you two working together?

622
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:14,681
当然不会
Absolutely not.

623
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:18,428
不确定
Unclear.

624
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,627
等一下航天飞机舱碰头
I'll meet you in the shuttle bay.

625
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:23,795
你没有要去吧？
Jim, you're not actually going down there, are you?

626
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:27,629
车子爆胎就不应该抢银行
You don't rob a bank when the getaway car has a flat tire.

627
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:31,539
等我们回来轮机室也该修好了
I'm sure engineering will have us all patched up

628
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:33,469
<i>对不对，契可夫？</i>
by the time we get back.

629
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,779
<i>Isn't that right, Mr. Chekov?</i>

630
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:34,711
对，舰长
Yes, Captain.

631
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,876
<i>我尽力</i>
<i>- I 'll do my best, sir.</i>

632
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:40,375
苏鲁，舰桥交给你
Mr. Sulu, you have the conn.

633
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:41,651
我们出发以后
Once we're en route, I want you to transmit

634
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:44,653
传送讯息到哈里森的位置
a targeted comm burst to Harrison's location.

635
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:47,220
就说有一堆鱼雷正瞄准他
You tell him you have a bunch of real big torpedoes pointed at his head

636
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,383
他不乖就打爆他
and if he doesn't play nice, you're not afraid to use them.

637
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:52,123
没问题吧？    - 没有
- Is that a problem? - No, sir.

638
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,694
只是我还没坐过那张椅子
I've just never sat in the chair before.

639
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:56,799
你没问题的
You're gonna do great.

640
00:43:58,502 --> 00:43:59,969
吉姆！等等！
Jim! Wait!

641
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:04,637
你刚叫他没有筹码就上赌桌吹牛
You just sat that man down at a high-stakes poker game

642
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:05,060
with no cards and told him to bluff.

643
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:07,375
苏鲁是个好人，但他不是舰长
Now Sulu's a good man, but he is no captain.

644
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:08,576
至少这两小时他是
For the next two hours, he is.

645
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:10,805
还有不要再用比喻了，这是命令
And enough with the metaphors, all right? That's an order.

646
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,249
把科诺米小艇做好起飞准备
Mr. Sulu, make sure that K'normian ship is ready to fly.

647
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,428
代理舰长苏鲁呼叫2号航天飞机舱
Acting Captain Sulu to Shuttle Bay 2.

648
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:30,028
<i>把默德事件没收的小艇加好油准备起飞</i>
<i>Please have the trade ship we confiscated</i>

649
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:30,127
<i>during the Mudd incident last month fueled and flight ready.</i>

650
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,369
<i>寇克舰长即将抵达</i>
<i>Captain Kirk is en route to you now.</i>

651
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:37,273
准备好出动了
Ready to deploy, Captain.

652
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:39,201
你们把红制服换掉
Lieutenants, lose the red shirts.

653
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,774
你们要伪装成科诺米军火商，穿上这个
You are K'normian arms dealers. Put those on.

654
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:45,110
如果出差错，不能牵连到舰队
- Sir? - Look, if this thing goes south,

655
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:45,267
there can be nothing tying us to Starfleet.

656
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,907
除非你想开战，韩德夫
Unless of course you want to start a war, Mr. Hendorff.

657
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,986
不想
- No, sir. - No, sir.

658
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,446
很好，我也不想
Good. Me, neither.

659
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,035
我侦测到克莎省只有一个人
I am detecting a single life sign in the Ketha Province.

660
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:15,810
照史考特的数据，应该是约翰哈里森
Given the information provided by Mr. Scott,

661
00:45:14,463 --> 00:45:15,824
this is most likely John Harrison.

662
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,174
苏鲁，我们找到他了，吓吓他
Mr. Sulu, I think we found our man.

663
00:45:17,633 --> 00:45:18,842
You let him know you mean business.

664
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:20,135
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

665
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:23,820
约翰哈里森，你给我听好
Attention, John Harrison.

666
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:27,416
我是企业号的日清苏鲁舰长
This is Captain Hikaru Sulu of the <i>U.</i> S. S. Enterprise.

667
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:31,750
一艘载有特种部队的航天飞机正往你那去
A shuttle of highly trained officers is on it's way to your location.

668
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:34,920
<i>如果你不立刻投降</i>
<i>If you do not surrender to them immediately,</i>

669
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:39,258
<i>我会发射整批已经锁定你的位置的…</i>
<i>I will unleash the entire payload of advanced long-range torpedoes</i>

670
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,561
<i>…先进长程鱼雷</i>
<i>currently locked onto your location.</i>

671
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:44,834
<i>给你两分钟考虑</i>
<i>You have two minutes to confirm your compliance.</i>

672
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:48,073
<i>不合作我就把你炸掉</i>
<i>Refusal to do so will result in your obliteration.</i>

673
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,579
要是想测试我，你就死定了
If you test me, you will fail.

674
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,422
苏鲁…
Mr. Sulu,

675
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,088
提醒我不要惹毛你
remind me never to piss you off.

676
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:07,062
“克罗诺斯”
We will arrive at Harrison's location

677
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:09,928
<i>三分钟后会到达哈里森的位置</i>

678
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:11,758
他应该不会束手就擒
in three minutes, Captain.

679
00:46:10,394 --> 00:46:11,937
It is unlikely that he will come willingly.

680
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:15,698
他有91.6％的机率会尝试杀了我们
I calculate the odds of him attempting to kill us at 91.6%.

681
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,099
太棒了
Fantastic.

682
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:18,569
幸好你一点也不怕死
Good thing you don't care about dying.

683
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:22,411
对不起，我没听清楚
I am sorry, Lieutenant. I could not hear what you said.

684
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:23,940
我没说什么
I didn't say anything.

685
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,978
其实你肯听的话我就说
Actually, I'd be happy to speak

686
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:32,081
我想私下讨论    - 你根本不想讨论
- if you're willing to listen to me. - Guys...

687
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:29,788
Lieutenant, I would prefer to discuss this in private.

688
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:31,290
You'd prefer not to discuss this at all.

689
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:33,823
你们真的要现在吵架吗？
Our current circumstances...

690
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:33,876
Are you really gonna do this right now?

691
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:37,093
你根本不重视我们之间…让我说完
What never seems to require your undivided focus...

692
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:37,191
I'm sorry, Captain, just two seconds.

693
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:40,993
在火山你也没为我们设想
- Okay. - Is us.

694
00:46:38,672 --> 00:46:40,924
At that volcano, you didn't give a thought to us.

695
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,596
你也不想想你死了我怎么办
What it would do to me if you died, Spock.

696
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:46,635
你一点感觉都没有
You didn't feel anything.

697
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:51,671
不在乎…不只我生你气，舰长也是
You didn't care.

698
00:46:48,932 --> 00:46:51,685
And I'm not the only one who's upset with you. The Captain is, too.

699
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:54,572
别把我拖下水
Wha... No, no, no. Don't drag me into this.

700
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:57,173
她说得也对
She is right.

701
00:46:57,447 --> 00:47:00,314
你说我不在乎死亡是不正确的
Your suggestion that I do not care about dying is incorrect.

702
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:04,586
有自主意识的生物当然有求生的意志
A sentient being's optimal chance

703
00:47:02,362 --> 00:47:04,448
at maximizing their utility is a long and prosperous life.

704
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:05,484
又来了
Great.

705
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:07,419
史巴克，你还是唱首情歌吧
Not exactly a love song, Spock.

706
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:09,158
你误会了
You misunderstand.

707
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:14,987
我知道自己会死，才决定压抑感觉
It is true I chose not to feel anything

708
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,917
upon realizing that my own life was ending.

709
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,328
帕克上将死的时候，我和他的意识融合
As Admiral Pike was dying,

710
00:47:17,419 --> 00:47:19,254
I joined with his consciousness

711
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:23,264
感觉到了他死亡瞬间的感受
and experienced what he felt at the moment of his passing.

712
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:26,335
愤怒，疑惑
Anger. Confusion.

713
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:28,008
孤独
Loneliness.

714
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:30,107
恐惧
Feat

715
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:33,514
我经历过那些感情
I had experienced those feelings before,

716
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:38,348
我的星球被摧毁时感受更加倍强烈
multiplied exponentially

717
00:47:35,604 --> 00:47:38,273
on the day my planet was destroyed.

718
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:44,024
我决定不再感受这样的感觉
Such a feeling is something I choose

719
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:43,946
never to experience again.

720
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:50,030
娜欧塔，你以为我压抑感情…
Nyota, you mistake my choice not to feel

721
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,868
…是因为我不在乎
as a reflection of my not caring.

722
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:57,366
我保证情况正好相反
Well, I assure you, the truth is precisely the opposite.

723
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:04,873
发生什么事？
What the hell was that?

724
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:06,979
讯号呢？
What happened? Where's their signal?

725
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:09,219
中断了，我在试着重新连接
It cut out. I'm working to get them back.

726
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:15,319
D4级克林贡战舰正在追我们
We are being pursued by a D-4 class Klingon vessel.

727
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:16,559
我以为这区没有人
I thought this sector was abandoned!

728
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:17,859
一定是巡逻舰
It must be a random patrol.

729
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:18,960
坐稳了！
Hold on!

730
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:24,330
这船没有武装
This ship has no offensive capabilities.

731
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:26,468
还有我们，把能源全转给我
It's got us. Give me all six fuel cells.

732
00:48:26,363 --> 00:48:28,282
Aye, Captain.

733
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:42,648
该死！
Damn it!

734
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,780
他们快速逼近，方向285
They're closing fast, bearing 285!

735
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,720
我们可以在那里甩掉他们！
All right, there! There! We can lose them there.

736
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:56,293
你想穿过那些结构体？这船挤不过去的
If you are suggesting that we utilize the passage

737
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:55,517
between the approaching structures,

738
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,397
可以的    - 绝对挤不过去
- this ship will not fit. - We'll fit.

739
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:00,296
可以的！可以的！
- Captain, we will not fit. - We'll fit, we'll fit!

740
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:19,188
我都说挤得过去的！
- I told you we'd fit. - I am not sure that qualifies.

741
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:21,050
我不认为那样算

742
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:25,962
看到他们了吗？
Any sign of them?

743
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:27,161
还没，我有点担心
- No. Which worries me. - We lost them!

744
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:28,356
甩掉他们了！
Or they're jamming our scanners.

745
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:29,658
或者我们的扫描仪被干扰
Or we lost them.

746
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:30,892
也说不定我们甩掉他们了

747
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:50,420
他们命令我们降落
They're ordering us to land.

748
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:54,317
舰长，他们会想知道我们来干嘛
Captain, they're gonna want to know why we're here.

749
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,752
他们会折磨我们
And they're gonna torture us.

750
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:58,594
拷问我们
Question us.

751
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:00,429
然后把我们杀了
And they're gonna kill us.

752
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:04,266
那我们就放手一搏
So we come out shooting.

753
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:10,432
他们人数众多，火力强大
We're outnumbered, outgunned.

754
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:13,776
冲出去只有死路一条
There's no way we survive if we attack first.

755
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:17,843
你找我是因为我会讲克林贡语
You brought me here because I speak Klingon.

756
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:20,846
让我去和他们讲讲看
Then let me speak Klingon.

757
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,396
这行不通的
This isn't going to work.

758
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,395
这是唯一合逻辑的选择
It is our only logical option.

759
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:15,671
如果你阻止她，不但会激怒克林贡人
And if you interrupt her now, you will not only incur the wrath of the Klingons

760
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:18,237
还会激怒乌胡拉
but that of Lieutenant Uhura as well.

761
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,148
我是来帮助你们的

762
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,267
拿去    - 谢谢
- Lieutenant. - Thanks, Captain.

763
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:02,015
恕我直言

764
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:07,319
有个逃犯躲在这个废墟

765
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:10,787
他杀了我们很多人

766
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:27,299
人类自相残杀关我什么事？

767
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:31,071
因为你重视荣誉

768
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:35,212
而这个人没有荣誉

769
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:38,448
你们的人也会陷入危险

770
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,460
把武器放下    - 有几发鱼雷？
- Stand down. - How many torpedoes?

771
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:03,510
把武器放下
Stand down!

772
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:06,995
你用来威胁我的鱼雷…
The torpedoes,

773
00:55:05,261 --> 00:55:07,261
the weapons you threatened me with in your message.

774
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,669
有几发？
How many are there?

775
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,172
72发
Seventy-two.

776
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,112
我投降
I surrender.

777
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,035
我代表克里斯托弗帕克…
On behalf of Christopher Pike,

778
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,526
…我的朋友…
my friend,

779
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,703
…接受你的投降
I accept your surrender.

780
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,963
舰长！
Captain!

781
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,004
舰长
Captain.

782
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:32,251
把他铐起来
Cuff him.

783
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:54,372
老骨头，到禁闭室来    - 马上到
<i>- Bones, meet me in the</i> brig. <i>- Be right there.</i>

784
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:55,778
上尉
Lieutenant.

785
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,874
通知舰队我们逮捕了哈里森
Contact Starfleet, let them know we have Harrison in custody,

786
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:02,781
等我们修好曲速核就会回去
and we'll be on our way once the warp core is repaired.

787
00:57:02,754 --> 00:57:04,005
Yes, sir.

788
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:22,537
<i>他为什么会投降？    - 不知道</i>
<i>- Why the hell did he surrender?</i> <i>- I don't know.</i>

789
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:25,765
我只想知道他如何杀光整队克林贡人
But he just took out a squad of Klingons single-handedly.

790
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:28,136
看来超人上了我们的船
I want to know how.

791
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:28,029
Sounds like we have a superman on board.

792
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,742
你检查看看
You tell me.

793
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:39,917
把手伸出来让我抽血
Put your arm through the hole. I'm gonna take a blood sample.

794
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:57,473
舰长，为什么我们还不回航？
Why aren't we moving, Captain?

795
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:01,504
难道是曲速核发生意外故障…
An unexpected malfunction, perhaps in your warp core

796
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:04,939
正好让你困在克林贡领空？
conveniently stranding you on the edge of Klingon space?

797
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,942
你怎么知道？    - 老骨头
- How the hell do you know that? - Bones.

798
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:11,515
你会感谢我的意见的
I think you'd find my insight valuable, Captain.

799
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:14,782
好了吗？
- We good? - Yeah.

800
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,125
有结果就告诉我
Let me know what you find.

801
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:22,461
不理我的话，全船的人都会死
Ignore me and you will get everyone on this ship killed.

802
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:31,196
我认为他只是想尝试影响你
Captain, I believe he will only attempt to manipulate you.

803
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,874
我不建议你继续与他对话
I would not recommend engaging the prisoner further.

804
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:35,544
很快就好
Give me a minute.

805
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:50,255
让我解释一下情况
Let me explain what's happening here.

806
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:52,390
你是个罪犯
You are a criminal.

807
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:55,060
我亲眼看到你滥杀无辜
I watched you murder innocent men and women.

808
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,723
我被授命狙杀你
I was authorized to end you!

809
00:58:58,134 --> 00:59:03,094
你还活着的原因也是因为我
And the only reason why you are still alive

810
00:59:01,414 --> 00:59:02,999
is because I am allowing it.

811
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:06,101
所以闭上你的嘴
So shut your mouth.

812
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:11,777
你还想打我打到手抽筋吗？
Oh, Captain, are you going to punch me again

813
00:59:09,005 --> 00:59:11,925
over and over till your arm weakens?

814
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:14,446
显然你很想杀我…
Clearly you want to, so tell me,

815
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:17,780
那为什么还留我活口？
why did you allow me to live?

816
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:19,145
每个人都会做错事
We all make mistakes.

817
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:22,050
不是，我投降的原因
No. I surrendered to you because,

818
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:27,285
是因为你虽然刻意隐瞒，却有良知
despite your attempt to convince me otherwise,

819
00:59:24,312 --> 00:59:27,190
you seem to have a conscience, Mr. Kirk.

820
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:33,131
如果你没有，我也不可能说服你
If you did not, then it would be impossible for me

821
00:59:30,985 --> 00:59:33,029
to convince you of the truth.

822
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:38,971
23…17…46…11
23-17-46-11.

823
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:42,140
这坐标离地球很近
Coordinates not far from Earth.

824
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:45,413
你想知道我为什么这么做
If you want to know why I did what I did,

825
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:47,073
就去那里看一看
go and take a look.

826
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:50,148
我为什么要听你的
Give me one reason why I should listen to you.

827
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,317
我有72个理由
I can give you 72.

828
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:55,650
而且全都在你船上
And they're on board your ship, Captain.

829
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:58,991
他们一直在这儿
They have been all along.

830
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:02,458
我建议你随便打开一个
I suggest you open one up.

831
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:19,701
- Ohoo. - Hey.

832
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,149
你知道我最担心什么吗？
You know what really bothers me, though?

833
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:32,994
是我做的那些修改和强化的零件
It's the modifications, you know, the enhancements.

834
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:38,493
竟然这样把我赶走！我只是做对的事！
Right? And then like that, I'm off the ship!

835
01:00:36,217 --> 01:00:38,386
Just for trying to do what's right!

836
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:40,432
你又做了什么？
And what did you do anyway?

837
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,003
你只是像个蚌壳一直瞪着我！
You just stood there like an oyster,

838
01:00:41,848 --> 01:00:43,057
looking at me!

839
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:45,771
史考特，我是寇克
What?

840
01:00:44,434 --> 01:00:45,893
Scotty, it's Kirk.

841
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,442
噢，是你啊！
Oh, well now!

842
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:50,338
这可不是美发男詹姆士舰长吗？
If it isn't Captain James Tiberius Perfect Hair!

843
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,507
<i>你有没有听到？我叫他美发男耶</i>
<i>Did you hear that? I called him Perfect Hair.</i>

844
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,339
你在哪里？    - <i>你又在哪里？</i>
<i>- Where are you? - Where are you?</i>

845
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:55,280
你喝醉了吗？
Are you drunk?

846
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,343
我下班时间喝酒不用你管
What I do in my private time is my business, Jimbo.

847
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:01,189
帮我一个忙，把这坐标写下来好吗？
I need you to help me out with something.

848
01:01:00,033 --> 01:01:01,326
Will you take these coordinates down?

849
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:04,458
23…17…46…11
23-17-46-11.

850
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:06,560
<i>你写下来了？</i>
<i>Are you writing?</i>

851
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:09,028
四个号码，很难吗？
What, you don't think I can remember four numbers?

852
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:12,363
这么不相信我，第三个号码是多少？
Ye of little faith. What was the third one?

853
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,466
<i>46</i>
<i>Forty-six.</i>

854
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,704
我不知道你要找什么
I don't know exactly what you're looking for,

855
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:20,974
但我猜你看到就知道了
but I have a feeling you'll know it when you see it.

856
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:23,644
鱼雷的事可能被你说中了
You may have been right about those torpedoes.

857
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:29,650
我就当你是在道歉，我会考虑看看
I will consider that an apology.

858
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,645
And I will consider that apology.

859
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,245
是你自己要辞职的
You are the one who quit.

860
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,149
是你逼我辞职的！
You made me quit!

861
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,048
史考特？
Mr. Scott?

862
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:37,717
史考特
Scott.

863
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:40,991
他还真大胆
The nerve of that guy!

864
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:45,065
我才不帮他！
I am not doing that man any favors!

865
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:46,894
不帮就是不帮！
No!

866
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:48,828
好啦好啦
All right, then!

867
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:50,902
你疯了吗？
Are you out of your corn-fed mind?

868
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:52,938
你怎么能相信他！
You're not actually going to listen to this guy?

869
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:55,044
他杀了帕克还差点杀了你
He killed Pike, he almost killed you,

870
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:58,109
他现在叫你开鱼雷你就开？
and now you think it's a good idea to pop open a torpedo

871
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:00,382
老骨头，他为什么救我们？
because he dared you to.

872
01:01:58,633 --> 01:02:00,426
Why did he save our lives, Bones?

873
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,117
舰长，他说的有道理
The Doctor does have a point, Captain.

874
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:03,612
史巴克，别附和我
Don't agree with me, Spock. It makes me very uncomfortable.

875
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:04,777
我浑身不对劲
Perhaps you, too, should learn to govern your emotions, Doctor.

876
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:08,888
也许你该学习控制你的情绪，逻辑上…

877
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:12,616
逻辑？一个疯子想炸掉我们的船…
In this situation, logic dictates...

878
01:02:09,143 --> 01:02:11,187
Logic? Oh, my God! There's a maniac

879
01:02:11,312 --> 01:02:12,939
trying to make us blow up our own damn ship and...

880
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:14,863
我不知道他为什么投降
That's not it. I don't know why he surrendered,

881
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:16,226
但不会是要杀我们
but that's not it.

882
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:18,626
我们要打开鱼雷，问题只是怎么打开？
Look, we're gonna open a torpedo. The question is how.

883
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:20,766
现在史考特不在
But, Jim, without Mr. Scott on board,

884
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:23,905
还有谁可以拆炸弹？
who exactly is qualified

885
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:24,158
to just pop open a four-ton stick of dynamite?

886
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,568
上将的女儿对那鱼雷很有兴趣
The Admiral's daughter appeared to have interest

887
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:28,075
而且还是武器专家
in the torpedoes and she is a weapons specialist.

888
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:30,412
或许她可以帮忙
Perhaps she could be of some use.

889
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:32,144
谁是上将的女儿？
What Admiral's daughter?

890
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:33,472
卡萝马可士
Carol Marcus. Your new science officer

891
01:02:33,616 --> 01:02:36,642
你的新科学官是用假名登船的
concealed her identity to board the ship.

892
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,578
你打算什么时候才说？
When were you going to tell me that?

893
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:41,483
有必要才说，就是现在
When it became relevant. As it just did.

894
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:43,157
鱼雷在武器室吗？
Are the torpedoes in the weapons bay?

895
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:44,851
早就装填好了，里面到底装了什么？
Loaded and ready to fire. What are they?

896
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:47,857
不知道，所以我伪造文件跑来想弄清楚
I don't know. That's why I forged my transfer

897
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:49,464
真的对不起
onto your ship to find out why.

898
01:02:47,932 --> 01:02:49,642
I do apologize for that.

899
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:52,132
很抱歉我造成你困扰
By the way, if I caused you any problems, I am sorry.

900
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:53,702
我是卡萝马可士
I'm Carol Marcus.

901
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,035
詹姆士寇克
- James Kirk. - Torpedoes.

902
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:56,102
鱼雷…

903
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:59,464
我父亲让我参与所有和他有关的计划
My father gave me access to every program he oversaw,

904
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,770
后来听说他在研发实验性鱼雷
then I heard he was developing these prototype torpedoes.

905
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:05,444
当我去问他时，他却不肯见我
When I went to confront him about it, he wouldn't even see me.

906
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:10,115
我才发现鱼雷的纪录都被删除了
That's when I discovered the torpedoes had disappeared

907
01:03:07,952 --> 01:03:10,079
from all official records.

908
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:12,113
然后他把鱼雷都给我了
And then he gave them to me.

909
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:15,219
舰长，你比传说中的聪明多了
You're much cleverer than your reputation suggests, Captain Kirk.

910
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:16,788
我还有传言啊？
I have a reputation?

911
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:19,561
有啊，我是克丽丝汀查佩的朋友
Yes, you do. I'm a friend of Christine Chapel's.

912
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:21,126
克丽丝汀啊，她还好吗？
Christine, yes. How is she?

913
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:24,299
在边疆当护士，她现在开心多了
She transferred to the outer frontier to be a nurse.

914
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,567
很好啊
She's much happier now.

915
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:28,065
你根本不知道我在说谁吧？
That's good.

916
01:03:25,761 --> 01:03:28,055
You have no idea who I'm talking about, do you?

917
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:30,072
我们来这做什么？
What are we doing in here?

918
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:31,966
这个航天飞机可以起飞吗？    - 可以
Is this shuttle prepped to fly?

919
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:34,072
请你转过去一下    - 为什么？
Of course it is.

920
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,187
- Would you please turn around? - Why?

921
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:36,645
转过去就对了
Just turn around.

922
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:41,739
在企业号上拆鱼雷太危险了
It's too dangerous to try and open

923
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,736
one of these torpedoes on the Enterprise.

924
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:45,986
附近有颗小行星，我可以在那里拆
But there is a nearby planetoid.

925
01:03:44,614 --> 01:03:46,199
I can open one up there.

926
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:48,154
但我需要有人帮忙
But I will need some help.

927
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:50,090
转回去啊
Turn around.

928
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:52,488
转啊！
Now!

929
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:55,497
舰长抵达舰桥！
Captain on the bridge!

930
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:59,495
苏鲁，马可士和麦考伊降落了没？
Mr. Sulu,

931
01:03:57,251 --> 01:03:59,712
have Doctors Marcus and McCoy landed on the planetoid yet?

932
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:02,497
有，他们正把鱼雷搬出来
Yes, sir. They're moving the torpedo into position now.

933
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:04,772
很好，克林贡人有动静吗？
Good. Any activity from the Klingons?

934
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:08,269
还没，但我们困在这里，迟早会被发现
Not yet.

935
01:04:06,302 --> 01:04:08,463
But if we're stuck here much longer, they will find us.

936
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:10,076
乌胡拉
Lieutenant Uhura, did you let Starfleet know

937
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,443
舰队知道已逮捕哈里森的消息吗？
we have Harrison in custody?

938
01:04:12,715 --> 01:04:15,343
我通知了，但还没响应
Yes, sir. No response yet.

939
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:19,518
<i>轮机室呼叫舰桥，舰长，听到吗？</i>
<i>Engineering to bridge.</i>

940
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,607
<i>Hello. Captain, can you hear me?</i>

941
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:21,517
契可夫，我只要听好消息
Mr. Chekov, give me some good news.

942
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:26,291
找到泄漏点了，有些严重，我们在修理
We found the leak, sir, but the damage is substantial.

943
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:28,122
<i>你知道为什么外泄吗？</i>
We're working on it.

944
01:04:26,447 --> 01:04:28,115
<i>Any idea what caused it?</i>

945
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:32,358
不知道，但我负完全责任
No, sir. But I accept full responsibility.

946
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:37,703
我有预感不是你的错，继续努力
Something tells me it wasn't your fault. Stay on it.

947
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:39,872
航天飞机准备好了
Shuttle is standing by, Captain.

948
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:44,410
老骨头，谢谢你，马可士要手最稳的人
Bones, thanks for helping out.

949
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:44,590
Dr. Marcus asked for the steadiest hands on the ship.

950
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:48,343
我幻想过和美女困在荒废星球上
You know, when I dreamt about being stuck

951
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,302
on a deserted planet with a gorgeous woman,

952
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:49,509
我可没梦到鱼雷！
there was no torpedo!

953
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:52,319
<i>麦考伊，我可没叫你去泡妞</i>
<i>Dr. McCoy, may I remind you, you are not there to flirt.</i>

954
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:55,156
你想要这双神奇的手怎么帮你？
So how can these legendary hands help you, Dr. Marcus?

955
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:56,388
<i>老骨头！</i>
<i>Bones!</i>

956
01:04:56,692 --> 01:05:01,220
我们得拆开弹头，才能了解它的威力
To understand how powerful these weapons are,

957
01:04:58,354 --> 01:04:59,521
we need to open the warhead.

958
01:04:59,522 --> 01:05:01,148
To do that, we need to access the fuel compartment.

959
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:04,693
但是这些弹头都已经在待命中
Unfortunately for us,

960
01:05:02,316 --> 01:05:04,902
the warheads on these weapons are live.

961
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:08,266
宝贝，我帮葛恩人紧急接生过
Sweetheart, I once performed

962
01:05:06,112 --> 01:05:08,489
an emergency C-section on a pregnant Gorn.

963
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:11,903
八胞胎，而且他们一出生就会咬人
Octuplets.

964
01:05:09,657 --> 01:05:11,826
And let me tell you, those little bastards bite.

965
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:14,903
鱼雷还难不倒我啦
I think I can work some magic on your missile.

966
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:18,945
内框里面有很多光纤线路
Dr. McCoy, there's a bundle of fiber optic cables

967
01:05:17,665 --> 01:05:19,083
against the inner casing.

968
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,182
你得切断第23条
You'll need to cut the 23rd wire down.

969
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:23,878
千万别碰到其它的，知道吗？
Whatever you do, do not touch anything else.

970
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:26,053
我也没想过
Do you understand?

971
01:05:24,088 --> 01:05:26,007
Right. The thought never crossed my mind.

972
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:27,256
麦考伊医生
Dr. McCoy,

973
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:31,221
<i>等我指示，我要绕过引爆装置</i>
<i>wait for my word.</i>

974
01:05:29,552 --> 01:05:31,429
<i>I'm rerouting the detonation processor.</i>

975
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:33,462
准备好了吗？    - 等不及了
- Are you ready? - And raring.

976
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:34,730
祝你好运
Good luck.

977
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,893
鱼雷启动了    - 30秒后引爆！
Sir, the torpedo just armed itself.

978
01:05:37,602 --> 01:05:39,103
The warhead's gonna detonate in 30 seconds, sir!

979
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:41,566
搞什么鬼？我的手卡住了！
What the hell happened? I can't get my arm out!

980
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,235
锁定他们讯号，把他们传送回来
Target their signal. Beam them back right now.

981
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:45,474
传送器没办法分开麦考伊和鱼雷
The transporter cannot differentiate between Dr. McCoy and the torpedo.

982
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:49,404
一次得整个传送回来
We cannot beam back one without the other.

983
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:51,406
<i>马可士，你能拆除它吗？</i>    - 我正在试
Dr. Marcus, can you disarm it?

984
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:52,978
我正在试
I'm trying. I'm trying

985
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:54,440
把她救走！
Jim, get her the hell out of here!

986
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:55,949
不！传送我他就死定了！
No! If you beam me back, he dies!

987
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:57,751
<i>不要干扰我！</i>
<i>Just let me do it!</i>

988
01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,914
10，9…
Ten. Nine.

989
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:01,086

Eight.

990
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:03,758
准备好传送马可士博士了
Standing by to transport Dr. Marcus on your command, sir.

991
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:05,582
4，3…
Four. Three.

992
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:07,284
该死！
Shit!

993
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:15,003
成功解除引爆
Deactivation successful,

994
01:06:13,471 --> 01:06:14,972
Captain.

995
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:17,806
麦考伊，你没事吧？
Dr. McCoy, are you all right?

996
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:24,407
<i>老骨头！</i>
<i>Bones!</i>

997
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:26,640
吉姆？
Jim?

998
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:29,743
你得来看看这个
You're going to want to see this.

999
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:42,659
“坐标23.17.46.11，木星”

1000
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:38,652
<i>第四小组，把推进器送到12号码头</i>
<i>Delta team, deliver your thrusters to loading dock 12.</i>

1001
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:43,718
<i>星舰复仇号，请求进入建设机棚</i>
U.S.S. Vengeance, <i>bridge crew</i>

1002
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:43,686
<i>requesting entry to construction hangar.</i>

1003
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:47,326
<i>允许进入机棚</i>
<i>Man 1'. You are cleared to enter the hangar.</i>

1004
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:59,897
<i>我需要焊接人员到一号引擎舱</i>
<i>Man 3'. I need a welding team on the number one nacelle.</i>

1005
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:04,746
挖哩…
Holy...

1006
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:07,749
有什么发现？
What have we got?

1007
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:10,917
这招很聪明，燃料箱被拆掉…
It's quite clever actually.

1008
01:08:08,919 --> 01:08:11,046
This fuel container's been removed from the torpedo

1009
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,848
冬眠舱再放进去
and retrofitted to hide this cryo tube.

1010
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:17,191
他活着吗？    - 还活着
- Is he alive? - He's alive.

1011
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:19,424
但如果想叫醒他
But if we try to revive him

1012
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:21,719
解冻程序出错他就会死
without the proper sequencing, it could kill him.

1013
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:23,924
这科技我不熟
This technology's beyond me.

1014
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,497
这很先进吗？
How advanced, Doctor?

1015
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:28,099
不是先进，这冬眠舱是古董
It's not advanced. That cryo tube is ancient.

1016
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:31,099
自从曲速技术成熟以后…
We haven't needed to freeze anyone since we developed warp capability,

1017
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:32,396
就再也不必进行冷冻了
which explains the most interesting thing about our friend here.

1018
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:35,602
这也是这位朋友好玩的地方

1019
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:37,542
他已经300岁了
He's 300 years old.

1020
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,082
为什么鱼雷里躺了一个人？
Why is there a man in that torpedo?

1021
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:52,457
所有鱼雷里都有人
There are men and women

1022
01:08:50,628 --> 01:08:52,421
in all those torpedoes, Captain.

1023
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:54,062
是我放进去的
I put them there.

1024
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:57,432
你到底是谁？
Who the hell are you?

1025
01:09:02,631 --> 01:09:05,259
我是旧时代的杰作
A remnant of a time long past.

1026
01:09:06,468 --> 01:09:08,402
基因强化后要带领人类
Genetically engineered to be superior

1027
01:09:08,504 --> 01:09:11,439
终结世界大战，带来和平
so as to lead others to peace in a world at war.

1028
01:09:12,641 --> 01:09:17,601
但我们却被当成罪犯被放逐
But we were condemned as criminals, forced into exile.

1029
01:09:18,881 --> 01:09:20,678
沉睡了几世纪…
For centuries we slept,

1030
01:09:21,817 --> 01:09:25,446
希望在醒后世界已经改变
hoping when we awoke, things would be different.

1031
01:09:25,888 --> 01:09:28,015
但是自从瓦肯星被摧毁以后
But as a result of the destruction of Vulcan,

1032
01:09:28,323 --> 01:09:31,781
星际舰队积极地向境外的象限扩张
your Starfleet began to aggressively search

1033
01:09:30,501 --> 01:09:31,752
distant quadrants of space.

1034
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:34,460
发现了我们的船，只有我被叫醒
My ship was found adrift. I alone was revived.

1035
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:38,029
我查约翰哈里森，一年前根本没这个人
I looked up "John Harrison."

1036
01:09:36,632 --> 01:09:38,008
Until a year ago, he didn't exist.

1037
01:09:38,333 --> 01:09:41,632
约翰哈里森是个虚构人物
John Harrison was a fiction created the moment I was awoken

1038
01:09:41,904 --> 01:09:44,805
马可士上将叫醒我来帮助他
by your Admiral Marcus to help him advance his cause.

1039
01:09:45,374 --> 01:09:48,775
建立假身分来掩饰我
A smokescreen to conceal my true identity.

1040
01:09:49,845 --> 01:09:53,110
我名字叫做可汗
My name is

1041
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:53,357
Khan.

1042
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,948
星舰上将为什么需要…
Why would a Starfleet Admiral

1043
01:10:01,323 --> 01:10:04,781
一个300岁的冷冻人帮忙？
ask a 300-year-old frozen man for help?

1044
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,628
因为我比较强
Because I am better.

1045
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:08,794
哪方面？
- At what? - Everything.

1046
01:10:08,897 --> 01:10:10,364
各方面

1047
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:13,801
马可士上将身处和平盛世
Alexander Marcus needed to respond to

1048
01:10:13,902 --> 01:10:15,961
却面临战争威胁
an uncivilized threat in a civilized time

1049
01:10:16,238 --> 01:10:19,696
他需要有战斗专长的人，就是我
and for that he needed a Warrior's mind.

1050
01:10:18,507 --> 01:10:19,675
My mind.

1051
01:10:20,075 --> 01:10:22,134
来设计武器和战舰
To design weapons and warships.

1052
01:10:22,511 --> 01:10:23,978
你说上将违反所有的规章…
You are suggesting the Admiral

1053
01:10:24,246 --> 01:10:28,205
只是为了要利用你的智力
violated every regulation he vowed to uphold

1054
01:10:26,307 --> 01:10:28,392
simply because he wanted to exploit your intellect.

1055
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:30,748
他是想利用我残暴的天性
He wanted to exploit my savagery.

1056
01:10:31,119 --> 01:10:33,747
只有智力是打不赢的，史巴克
Intellect alone is useless in a fight, Mr. Spock.

1057
01:10:34,056 --> 01:10:38,356
你连规定都不敢打破，怎么打断骨头？
You... You can't even break a rule.

1058
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:38,402
How would you be expected to break bone?

1059
01:10:39,361 --> 01:10:41,886
马可士上将利用我设计武器
Marcus used me to design weapons.

1060
01:10:42,097 --> 01:10:44,759
帮他把星际舰队变成一支战斗军队
To help him realize his vision of a militarized Starfleet.

1061
01:10:45,233 --> 01:10:47,861
他派你来发射武器
He sent you to use those weapons.

1062
01:10:48,236 --> 01:10:52,195
把我的鱼雷射到无关的星球
To fire my torpedoes on an unsuspecting planet.

1063
01:10:52,908 --> 01:10:55,376
然后故意破坏你的船
And then he purposely crippled your ship

1064
01:10:55,744 --> 01:10:59,373
让你困在敌境等死
in enemy space, leading to one inevitable outcome.

1065
01:10:59,748 --> 01:11:03,047
克林贡人会来寻找攻击者
The Klingons would come searching

1066
01:11:01,342 --> 01:11:03,177
for whomever was responsible,

1067
01:11:03,318 --> 01:11:05,218
你们根本死路一条
and you would have no chance of escape.

1068
01:11:05,487 --> 01:11:09,719
这样马可士就可以准备开战了
Marcus would finally have the war he talked about.

1069
01:11:10,092 --> 01:11:11,889
正如他所愿
The war he always wanted.

1070
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:13,887
不，不可能
No. No.

1071
01:11:14,930 --> 01:11:18,559
我看到你攻击一群没武装的军官
I watched you open fire

1072
01:11:16,023 --> 01:11:18,776
in a room full of unarmed Starfleet officers.

1073
01:11:18,834 --> 01:11:20,563
你冷血屠杀了他们！
You killed them in cold blood!

1074
01:11:20,836 --> 01:11:23,066
马可士把我的船员抢走了
Marcus took my crew from me.

1075
01:11:23,338 --> 01:11:24,635
你是个凶手！
You are a murderer!

1076
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:28,398
他用我的朋友来威胁我
He used my friends to control me.

1077
01:11:32,614 --> 01:11:35,242
我把他们藏在武器里
I tried to smuggle them to safety

1078
01:11:35,517 --> 01:11:38,816
想要偷偷逃走
by concealing them in the very weapons

1079
01:11:37,086 --> 01:11:38,796
I had designed,

1080
01:11:40,622 --> 01:11:42,590
但是被发现了
but I was discovered.

1081
01:11:43,959 --> 01:11:47,588
我只好自己逃走
I had no choice but to escape alone.

1082
01:11:49,131 --> 01:11:53,261
我逃走以后…
And when I did, I had every reason to suspect

1083
01:11:53,535 --> 01:11:56,333
马可士一定会杀我所有的同伴
that Marcus had killed every single one

1084
01:11:56,638 --> 01:12:00,938
我最爱的一群人
of the people I hold most dear.

1085
01:12:05,313 --> 01:12:07,781
所以我就以牙还牙
So I responded in kind.

1086
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:13,117
我的船员…
My crew

1087
01:12:13,488 --> 01:12:15,786
就是我的家人
is my family, Kirk.

1088
01:12:16,491 --> 01:12:20,120
为了你的家人你有什么做不出来？
Is there anything you would not do for your family?

1089
01:12:22,364 --> 01:12:25,299
<i>外围警报！有船以曲速朝我们接近中</i>
<i>Proximity</i> alert, <i>sir!</i>

1090
01:12:23,674 --> 01:12:25,426
<i>There's a ship at warp heading right for us.</i>

1091
01:12:25,567 --> 01:12:27,194
克林贡人吗？    - 曲速？
- Klingons? - At warp?

1092
01:12:27,502 --> 01:12:30,130
不是，我们都知道是谁
No, Kirk.

1093
01:12:30,505 --> 01:12:33,303
<i>应该不是，不是从克罗诺斯来的</i>
<i>- We both know who it is. - I don't think so.</i>

1094
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:33,350
<i>It's not coming at us from Kronos.</i>

1095
01:12:38,513 --> 01:12:41,812
把他送去医疗室，找6个警卫看好他
Lieutenant, move Khan to med bay.

1096
01:12:39,773 --> 01:12:41,025
Post six security officers on him.

1097
01:12:42,551 --> 01:12:44,178
舰长抵达舰桥！
Yes, Captain.

1098
01:12:42,484 --> 01:12:44,611
Captain on the bridge!

1099
01:12:44,753 --> 01:12:46,050
对方多久会到？
ETA of the incoming ship.

1100
01:12:46,354 --> 01:12:47,548
3秒钟
Three seconds, sir.

1101
01:12:49,591 --> 01:12:51,559
防护罩    - 是的，长官
- Shields. - Aye, Captain.

1102
01:13:16,017 --> 01:13:17,484
他们在呼叫我们
They're hailing us, sir.

1103
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:19,717
放上屏幕
On screen.

1104
01:13:20,756 --> 01:13:22,986
全船广播，作为纪录
Broadcast shipwide, for the record.

1105
01:13:26,962 --> 01:13:28,259
寇克舰长
<i>Captain Kirk.</i>

1106
01:13:29,865 --> 01:13:32,231
马可士上将，我不知道你要来
Admiral Marcus. I wasn't expecting you.

1107
01:13:33,435 --> 01:13:34,993
你的船看起来真厉害
That's a hell of a ship you got there.

1108
01:13:35,303 --> 01:13:38,101
我也没想到你会违反命令
<i>And I wasn't expecting to get word</i>

1109
01:13:36,622 --> 01:13:38,142
<i>that you'd taken Harrison into custody</i>

1110
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:39,867
逮捕哈里森
<i>in violation of your orders.</i>

1111
01:13:40,909 --> 01:13:42,376
这个嘛…
Well, we...

1112
01:13:42,644 --> 01:13:46,444
我们曲速核故障以后，只好改变计划
We had to improvise when our warp core

1113
01:13:44,671 --> 01:13:46,590
unexpectedly malfunctioned.

1114
01:13:46,748 --> 01:13:48,545
但你早就知道了吧
But you already knew that, didn't you, sir?

1115
01:13:48,817 --> 01:13:50,114
我不懂你的意思
<i>MARCUS'. I don't take your meaning.</i>

1116
01:13:50,418 --> 01:13:54,047
你不就赶来了吗？来帮我们修理的吧？
Well, that's why you're here, isn't it?

1117
01:13:51,845 --> 01:13:53,972
To assist with our repairs?

1118
01:13:54,756 --> 01:13:59,056
不然舰队指挥官为什么要来中立区呢？
Why else would the head of Starfleet

1119
01:13:56,433 --> 01:13:58,352
personally come to the edge of the Neutral Zone?

1120
01:13:59,828 --> 01:14:01,295
他们在扫瞄我们
Captain, they're scanning our ship.

1121
01:14:01,596 --> 01:14:03,621
你在找什么，要不要我帮你？
Is there something I can help you find, sir?

1122
01:14:04,599 --> 01:14:06,226
囚犯在哪里？
<i>Where is your prisoner, Kirk?</i>

1123
01:14:06,601 --> 01:14:11,561
按照规定，我要把可汗带回去受审
Per Starfleet regulation,

1124
01:14:07,569 --> 01:14:11,782
I'm planning on returning Khan to Earth to stand trial.

1125
01:14:12,941 --> 01:14:14,568
惨了
Well, shit.

1126
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:17,077
你跟他讲话了
You talked to him.

1127
01:14:18,346 --> 01:14:20,644
我就怕你会这么做
This is exactly what I was hoping to spare you from.

1128
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:25,883
我冒着风险把那混蛋给叫醒
<i>I took a tactical risk and I woke that bastard up,</i>

1129
01:14:23,794 --> 01:14:26,213
<i>believing that his superior intelligence</i>

1130
01:14:26,254 --> 01:14:29,155
相信他的超凡智慧能帮我们保护自己
could help us protect ourselves from whatever came at us next.

1131
01:14:31,026 --> 01:14:32,323
但我错了
But I made a mistake.

1132
01:14:32,928 --> 01:14:36,557
现在他杀的人都算在我头上
<i>And now the blood of everybody he's killed is on my hands.</i>

1133
01:14:36,998 --> 01:14:38,795
所以我拜托你
So I'm asking you,

1134
01:14:39,334 --> 01:14:40,892
把他交给我
give him to me

1135
01:14:41,169 --> 01:14:43,797
让我可以把我的错做个了结
so that I can end what I started.

1136
01:14:47,275 --> 01:14:50,904
那我该拿他的船员怎么办呢？
And what exactly would you like me to do

1137
01:14:48,944 --> 01:14:50,863
with the rest of his crew, sir?

1138
01:14:52,447 --> 01:14:55,939
用他们射克林贡人？结束72条生命？
Fire them at the Klingons? End 72 lives?

1139
01:14:56,051 --> 01:14:57,416
顺便引起战争？
Start a war in the process?

1140
01:14:57,686 --> 01:15:00,314
是他自己把人放进鱼雷的
He put those people in those torpedoes.

1141
01:15:00,622 --> 01:15:03,989
我只是不希望你知道里面是什么
<i>And I simply didn't want to burden you</i>

1142
01:15:02,332 --> 01:15:04,418
<i>with knowing what was inside of them.</i>

1143
01:15:04,626 --> 01:15:06,423
你看到他一个人能造成多少破坏
<i>You saw what this man can do all by himself.</i>

1144
01:15:06,528 --> 01:15:09,588
假如他叫醒其它人会怎么样？
<i>Can you imagine what would happen if we woke up the rest of his crew?</i>

1145
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:13,429
他还说了什么？他是和平使者吗？
What else did he tell you? That he's a peacekeeper?

1146
01:15:13,702 --> 01:15:16,330
他在玩弄你，你还看不出来？
<i>He's playing you, son, don't you see that?</i>

1147
01:15:16,638 --> 01:15:20,096
可汗和他的船员都是被判死刑的战犯
<i>Khan and his crew were condemned to death as war criminals.</i>

1148
01:15:20,709 --> 01:15:25,169
我们应该执行死刑以免别人再受害
<i>And now it is our duty to carry out that sentence</i>

1149
01:15:22,811 --> 01:15:25,189
<i>before anybody else dies because of him.</i>

1150
01:15:27,883 --> 01:15:30,181
我再要求你一次！
Now, I'm going to ask you again!

1151
01:15:31,052 --> 01:15:33,020
最后一次
One last time, son.

1152
01:15:35,056 --> 01:15:36,683
降下防护罩
<i>Lower your shields.</i>

1153
01:15:37,225 --> 01:15:38,852
告诉我他在哪里
<i>Tell me where he is.</i>

1154
01:15:41,897 --> 01:15:43,797
他在轮机室
He's in engineering, sir.

1155
01:15:45,901 --> 01:15:48,870
我会把他送去传送室
But I'll have him moved

1156
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,879
to the transporter room right away.

1157
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:50,967
接下来就交给我吧
<i>I'll take it from here.</i>

1158
01:15:51,673 --> 01:15:53,470
苏鲁，千万不要降下防护罩
Do not drop those shields,

1159
01:15:53,742 --> 01:15:58,042
你明知可汗在医疗室，你有什么打算？
- Mr. Sulu. - Aye, Captain.

1160
01:15:53,842 --> 01:15:54,843
Captain, given your awareness

1161
01:15:54,968 --> 01:15:56,428
of Khan's true location in the med bay,

1162
01:15:56,511 --> 01:15:58,180
may I know the details of your plan?

1163
01:15:58,346 --> 01:16:01,008
我说过要把逃犯带回地球
I told Marcus we were bringing a fugitive back to Earth.

1164
01:16:01,116 --> 01:16:02,981
我还打算这么做
That's what we're going to do.

1165
01:16:03,251 --> 01:16:04,548
契可夫，我们有曲速了吗？
Mr. Chekov, can we warp?

1166
01:16:04,853 --> 01:16:09,483
如果强行启动可能会严重损坏核心
Sir, if we go to warp,

1167
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,566
we run the risk of seriously damaging the core!

1168
01:16:09,758 --> 01:16:11,055
<i>可不可以？</i>
Can <i>we do it?</i>

1169
01:16:11,927 --> 01:16:15,488
技术上可以，但我不建议
Technically, yes, but I would not advise it, Captain.

1170
01:16:15,931 --> 01:16:17,057
知道了
Noted.

1171
01:16:17,933 --> 01:16:20,060
苏鲁，设定航向回地球
Mr. Sulu, set course for Earth.

1172
01:16:20,235 --> 01:16:21,099
是，长官
Yes, sir.

1173
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:23,071
出发
Punch it.

1174
01:16:23,071 --> 01:16:23,594
出发

1175
01:16:30,745 --> 01:16:33,373
至少船又开了
Well, at least we're moving again.

1176
01:16:35,417 --> 01:16:39,046
你以为进曲速就安全的话，那你就错了
If you think you're safe at warp, you're wrong.

1177
01:16:43,124 --> 01:16:44,853
联络舰队
Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet.

1178
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,861
说我们被不明联邦船舰追赶至中立区
Tell them we were pursued into the Neutral Zone

1179
01:16:46,186 --> 01:16:47,771
by an unmarked Federation ship.

1180
01:16:48,063 --> 01:16:48,927
通讯系统故障了
Comms are down, sir.

1181
01:16:51,566 --> 01:16:53,534
请求允许进入舰桥    - 马可士
Permission to come on the bridge.

1182
01:16:52,651 --> 01:16:53,694
Dr. Marcus.

1183
01:16:54,469 --> 01:16:57,632
他会追上来，但我能阻止他摧毁这艘船
He's gonna catch up with us, and when he does,

1184
01:16:55,821 --> 01:16:57,155
the only thing that's gonna stop him destroying

1185
01:16:57,772 --> 01:16:58,636
你得让我跟他谈一谈
this ship is me, so you have to let me talk to him.

1186
01:16:58,807 --> 01:17:00,604
我们在曲速，他追不上的
Carol, we're at warp. He can't catch up with us.

1187
01:17:00,909 --> 01:17:03,207
他的船有先进的曲速科技
Yes, he can. He's been developing a ship

1188
01:17:03,378 --> 01:17:05,938
舰长！这个读数我看不懂
that has advanced warp capabilities...

1189
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:05,998
Captain! I'm getting a reading I don't understand.

1190
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:38,140
我们在哪里？    - 离地球23万公里
- Where are we? - We're 237,000 kilometers from Earth.

1191
01:17:38,246 --> 01:17:39,076
损害报告！
- Damage report! - Weapons are way down.

1192
01:17:39,381 --> 01:17:40,439
武器失效，毫无防御
- Shields are dropping. - We're defenseless, sir.

1193
01:17:40,548 --> 01:17:42,015
舰身已有破裂
Sir, we have a bulkhead breach.

1194
01:17:42,317 --> 01:17:44,114
哪里损坏？    - 舰身严重破损
- Where's the damage? - Major hull damage, Captain.

1195
01:17:49,824 --> 01:17:52,019
紧急闪避动作！赶快逃到地球
Evasive maneuvers! Get us to Earth! Right now!

1196
01:17:52,394 --> 01:17:56,694
听好！你不让我跟他讲话，大家都会死
Captain! Stop! Everybody on this ship is going to die

1197
01:17:55,589 --> 01:17:56,910
if you don't let me speak to him.

1198
01:17:59,401 --> 01:18:00,527
乌胡拉，呼叫他们
Uhura, hail him.

1199
01:18:01,836 --> 01:18:04,134
爸爸，我是卡萝
Sir. It's me. It's Carol.

1200
01:18:13,715 --> 01:18:16,183
你在那艘船上做什么？
<i>What are you doing on that ship?</i>

1201
01:18:16,551 --> 01:18:18,178
我听到你刚说的话
I heard what you said.

1202
01:18:19,888 --> 01:18:23,517
你说你错了，现在想要弥补
That you made a mistake

1203
01:18:21,156 --> 01:18:23,575
and now you're doing everything you can to fix it.

1204
01:18:24,726 --> 01:18:26,023
但是，爸爸…
But, Dad,

1205
01:18:30,065 --> 01:18:32,863
我不相信养我长大的人
I don't believe that the man who raised me

1206
01:18:33,234 --> 01:18:37,694
会杀死全船无辜的人
is capable of destroying a ship full of innocent people.

1207
01:18:38,073 --> 01:18:40,541
<i>如果我错了…</i>
<i>And, if I'm wrong about that,</i>

1208
01:18:40,909 --> 01:18:43,309
你得一起把我杀了才行
then you're gonna have to do it with me on board.

1209
01:18:46,414 --> 01:18:48,041
卡萝，我不必连你一起杀
<i>Actually, Carol, I won't.</i>

1210
01:18:50,185 --> 01:18:51,228
Oh.

1211
01:18:53,088 --> 01:18:54,385
能不能拦截传送讯号？
- Jim... - Can we intercept the transport signal?

1212
01:18:54,556 --> 01:18:55,580
没办法
No, sir.

1213
01:18:57,984 --> 01:18:58,985
Carol!

1214
01:18:59,594 --> 01:19:03,496
寇克舰长，你擅自与哈里森结盟
<i>Captain Kirk, without authorization</i>

1215
01:19:01,571 --> 01:19:03,698
<i>and in league with the fugitive John Harrison,</i>

1216
01:19:03,765 --> 01:19:05,596
叛变并进入敌人领域
<i>you went rogue in enemy territory,</i>

1217
01:19:05,733 --> 01:19:08,725
逼我不得不追捕并摧毁你
<i>leaving me no choice</i>

1218
01:19:06,868 --> 01:19:08,787
<i>but to hunt you down and destroy you.</i>

1219
01:19:09,104 --> 01:19:11,072
锁定光炮    - 等等！等一下！
<i>- Lock</i> phasers. - Wait, sir, wait, wait, wait!

1220
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:12,498
有话快说
<i>I'll make this quick.</i>

1221
01:19:12,774 --> 01:19:14,833
舰尾鱼雷瞄准企业号舰桥
<i>Target all aft torpedoes on the Enterprise bridge.</i>

1222
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:17,408
我的船员只是听我的命令
Sir, my crew was just following my orders.

1223
01:19:17,712 --> 01:19:22,012
我为我的行为负全责，让我一个人负责
I take full responsibility for my actions.

1224
01:19:20,173 --> 01:19:22,217
But they were mine and they were mine alone.

1225
01:19:23,218 --> 01:19:27,518
我把可汗的位置告诉你，不要杀我船员
If I transmit Khan's location to you now,

1226
01:19:25,345 --> 01:19:27,681
all that I ask is that you spare them.

1227
01:19:34,562 --> 01:19:36,359
拜托你
Please, sir.

1228
01:19:38,233 --> 01:19:40,360
我什么都愿意做
I'll do anything you want.

1229
01:19:41,803 --> 01:19:43,600
放他们一条生路
Just let them live.

1230
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:47,540
这道歉还真诚恳
That's a hell of an apology.

1231
01:19:47,809 --> 01:19:51,768
这样讲好了，我本来也没想留活口
But if it's any consolation,

1232
01:19:49,995 --> 01:19:51,913
I was never going to spare your crew.

1233
01:19:54,082 --> 01:19:55,379
准备好就…
<i>Fire when...</i>

1234
01:20:15,837 --> 01:20:16,804
对不起
I'm sorry.

1235
01:20:24,345 --> 01:20:25,505
武器没办法发射！
Our weapons won't fire, sir!

1236
01:20:25,647 --> 01:20:26,636
防护罩失效了！
Our shields are down! We're losing power!

1237
01:20:26,948 --> 01:20:29,143
有人从轮机室重新启动所有系统
Someone in engineering just manually reset our systems!

1238
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:31,577
什么叫“有人”？是谁？
What do you mean, "someone"? Who?

1239
01:20:31,886 --> 01:20:33,183
他们武器系统关闭了
Their weapons have powered down. Sir.

1240
01:20:34,522 --> 01:20:36,752
<i>企业号！你们听得到吗？</i>
Enterprise! Can <i>you</i> hear me?

1241
01:20:37,025 --> 01:20:37,923
史考特！
Scotty!

1242
01:20:40,128 --> 01:20:41,823
猜猜我在木星找到了什么？
Guess what I found behind Jupiter.

1243
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:43,927
你在他们船上！    - <i>我溜进来的</i>
- You're on that ship! - I <i>snuck</i> on.

1244
01:20:44,199 --> 01:20:46,690
我刚做的事是叛国罪
And seeing as I've just committed an act of treason

1245
01:20:46,834 --> 01:20:48,426
我真的很想下船
against a Starfleet Admiral, I'd really like

1246
01:20:48,536 --> 01:20:49,332
快把我传送回去！
to get off this bloody ship. Now beam me out!

1247
01:20:49,604 --> 01:20:52,402
你真是个奇葩，我们现在能源不太够
You're a miracle worker.

1248
01:20:50,889 --> 01:20:52,724
We're a little low on power right now.

1249
01:20:52,707 --> 01:20:53,674
<i>等一下</i>
<i>Just stand by. Stand by.</i>

1250
01:20:53,942 --> 01:20:56,740
能源不足？企业号怎么了吗？
What do you mean, "low on power"?

1251
01:20:55,268 --> 01:20:56,548
<i>What happened to the Enterprise?</i>

1252
01:20:57,111 --> 01:20:58,237
我等下再打给你
Call you back.

1253
01:21:00,281 --> 01:21:01,407
史考特！
Scotty!

1254
01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:04,918
史巴克，我们的船怎么样了？
Spock. Our ship, how is she?

1255
01:21:05,553 --> 01:21:08,852
我们没什么能做的，不能打也不能逃
Our options are limited, Captain.

1256
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:08,990
We cannot fire and we cannot flee.

1257
01:21:12,227 --> 01:21:13,194
还有一件事能做
There is one option.

1258
01:21:13,628 --> 01:21:16,927
联络上史考特就转接给我    - 好的
Uhura, when you get Scotty back,

1259
01:21:15,372 --> 01:21:17,165
- patch him through. - Yes, sir.

1260
01:21:17,298 --> 01:21:18,424
史巴克，舰桥交给你
Mr. Spock, you have the conn.

1261
01:21:22,637 --> 01:21:24,434
舰长，我强烈反对
Captain, I strongly object.

1262
01:21:24,739 --> 01:21:26,366
反对什么？我什么都没说
To what? I haven't said anything yet.

1263
01:21:26,641 --> 01:21:28,268
既然我们不能从外面攻击
Since we cannot take the ship from the outside,

1264
01:21:28,409 --> 01:21:29,774
只能从内部破坏
the only way we can take it is from within.

1265
01:21:30,078 --> 01:21:31,477
由于大批登舰部队会被发现
And as a large boarding party would be detected,

1266
01:21:31,613 --> 01:21:34,275
只能越少人越好
it is optimal for you to take

1267
01:21:32,681 --> 01:21:34,432
as few members of the crew as possible.

1268
01:21:34,582 --> 01:21:36,880
你会和敌人交战
You will meet resistance, requiring personnel

1269
01:21:37,151 --> 01:21:40,120
需要有人善于战斗又熟悉内部
with advanced combat abilities

1270
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:40,105
and innate knowledge of that ship.

1271
01:21:40,421 --> 01:21:42,480
显然你想和可汗结盟
This indicates that you plan to align with Khan,

1272
01:21:42,624 --> 01:21:44,216
一个我们本来要杀的人
the very man we were sent here to destroy.

1273
01:21:44,492 --> 01:21:46,323
我没有要和他结盟，是利用他
I'm not aligning with him, I'm using him.

1274
01:21:46,461 --> 01:21:48,122
敌人的敌人就是我朋友
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."

1275
01:21:48,429 --> 01:21:52,058
讲这句阿拉伯俗语的王子后来被砍头了
An Arabic proverb attributed to a prince who was

1276
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:52,283
betrayed and decapitated by his own subjects.

1277
01:21:52,333 --> 01:21:54,301
这句话还是很酷
Still, it's a hell of a quote.

1278
01:21:54,602 --> 01:21:56,627
我也一起去    - 不，你要坐镇舰桥
- I will go with you, Captain. - No, I need you on the bridge.

1279
01:21:56,771 --> 01:21:59,137
我不能让你这么做
I cannot allow you to do this.

1280
01:21:59,607 --> 01:22:02,007
我的责任就是让你做最明智的决定
It is my function aboard this ship to advise you

1281
01:22:00,584 --> 01:22:02,002
on making the wisest decisions possible,

1282
01:22:02,143 --> 01:22:04,475
我确定你不知道怎么做最好
something I firmly believe

1283
01:22:03,253 --> 01:22:04,671
you are incapable of doing in this moment.

1284
01:22:04,779 --> 01:22:06,076
你说得对
You're right!

1285
01:22:07,682 --> 01:22:11,812
我做事没有道理、不合逻辑，只凭冲动
What I'm about to do, it doesn't make any sense,

1286
01:22:09,509 --> 01:22:11,970
it's not logical. It is a gut feeling.

1287
01:22:15,456 --> 01:22:17,981
我不知道我该做什么
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

1288
01:22:19,193 --> 01:22:21,161
我只知道我能做什么
I only know what I can do.

1289
01:22:22,030 --> 01:22:25,591
企业号需要有能力的人来指挥
The Enterprise and her crew need someone

1290
01:22:23,523 --> 01:22:26,318
in that chair that knows what he's doing.

1291
01:22:30,038 --> 01:22:31,437
那个人不是我
And it's not me.

1292
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:35,672
是你
It's you, Spock.

1293
01:22:58,399 --> 01:23:00,026
告诉我那艘船的一切
Tell me everything you know about that ship.

1294
01:23:00,668 --> 01:23:03,967
无畏级战舰，两倍大、三倍快
Dreadnought class.

1295
01:23:02,395 --> 01:23:04,064
Two times the size, three times the speed.

1296
01:23:04,238 --> 01:23:06,866
先进武器系统，只需少数船员操控
Advanced weaponry. Modified for a minimal crew.

1297
01:23:07,175 --> 01:23:10,042
和一般联邦星舰不同，这是战舰
Unlike most Federation vessels, it's built solely for combat.

1298
01:23:11,245 --> 01:23:16,205
我会尽全力让你得到应有的制裁
I will do everything I can

1299
01:23:14,074 --> 01:23:16,368
to make you answer for what you did.

1300
01:23:22,690 --> 01:23:24,055
但我现在需要你帮助
But right now I need your help.

1301
01:23:24,359 --> 01:23:26,054
我有什么好处？
In exchange for what?

1302
01:23:27,695 --> 01:23:29,993
你说愿意为船员付出一切
You said you'd do anything for your crew.

1303
01:23:31,532 --> 01:23:34,160
我可以保证他们安全    - 拜托
- I can guarantee their safety. - Captain.

1304
01:23:35,203 --> 01:23:38,832
你连你自己船员都保不住了
You can't even guarantee the safety of your own crew.

1305
01:23:44,879 --> 01:23:46,403
老骨头，你弄那个小毛怪干嘛？
Bones, what are you doing with that tribble?

1306
01:23:47,448 --> 01:23:48,574
牠死了
The tribble's dead.

1307
01:23:48,883 --> 01:23:52,842
我在注射可汗的血小板进牠的身体
I'm injecting Khan's platelets into the deceased tissue of a necrotic host.

1308
01:23:53,388 --> 01:23:57,415
他的细胞再生非常快，我想知道为什么
Khan's cells regenerate like nothing I've ever seen,

1309
01:23:55,824 --> 01:23:57,575
and I want to know why.

1310
01:24:02,797 --> 01:24:05,027
你到底跟不跟我去？
You coming with me or not?

1311
01:24:07,635 --> 01:24:09,034
你有没有搞错？
You want to do what?

1312
01:24:09,303 --> 01:24:12,431
我们要过去，苏鲁正在把船对准
We're coming over there. Sulu's maneuvering

1313
01:24:10,797 --> 01:24:12,632
<i>the Enterprise into position as we speak.</i>

1314
01:24:12,807 --> 01:24:14,104
<i>来这艘船？怎么来？</i>
<i>To this ship? How?</i>

1315
01:24:14,409 --> 01:24:16,877
7号船舱有个卸货门，编号101A
There's a cargo door, hangar 7, access port 101A.

1316
01:24:16,978 --> 01:24:19,037
你要手动打开闸门
You need to find the manual override to open that airlock.

1317
01:24:19,313 --> 01:24:21,611
你疯了吗？还有你是谁啊
Are you crazy? Whoever you are.

1318
01:24:21,983 --> 01:24:23,780
照他的话做，不会有问题的
Just listen to him, Scotty. It's gonna be all right.

1319
01:24:24,085 --> 01:24:25,382
当然有问题
It is not gonna be all right.

1320
01:24:25,653 --> 01:24:27,245
你叫我打开通往太空的闸门
You want me to open an airlock into space,

1321
01:24:27,355 --> 01:24:30,381
要是掉出去我会冻死然后爆开！
whereupon I will freeze, die and explode!

1322
01:24:30,658 --> 01:24:34,116
我们能从这里联络新瓦肯星吗？
Lieutenant, from our current position, is it possible

1323
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:34,070
to establish contact with New Vulcan?

1324
01:24:34,829 --> 01:24:37,297
我尽力试试    - 谢谢
- I'll do my best. - Thank you.

1325
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,227
苏鲁，对方的状态如何？
Mr. Sulu, what is the status of the other ship?

1326
01:24:41,502 --> 01:24:44,960
他们系统还没恢复，我正在把船对准
Their systems are still offline.

1327
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:44,914
I'm aligning our ship now.

1328
01:25:19,474 --> 01:25:20,498
史考特，状况怎么样？
Scotty, how we doing over there?

1329
01:25:21,142 --> 01:25:23,110
<i>我真希望我有好消息</i>
<i>Captain, I wish I had better news.</i>

1330
01:25:23,711 --> 01:25:27,511
<i>计算机接口操控已被限制，武器还有…</i>
<i>They've locked out access to the ship's computer.</i>

1331
01:25:25,872 --> 01:25:27,457
<i>They'll have full weapons in</i>

1332
01:25:27,815 --> 01:25:29,043
3分钟就会修复
three minutes.

1333
01:25:29,183 --> 01:25:32,778
下次我就没办法阻止他们了，稍候
That means next time I won't be able to stop them

1334
01:25:30,794 --> 01:25:32,629
destroying the Enterprise. Stand by.

1335
01:25:34,322 --> 01:25:37,621
我们的垃圾排放口瞄准101A闸门了
Commander, our trash exhaust is aimed at

1336
01:25:35,465 --> 01:25:37,717
access port 101A of the other ship.

1337
01:25:37,892 --> 01:25:39,450
舰长，已经瞄准好了
Captain, the ships are aligned.

1338
01:25:39,727 --> 01:25:40,591
收到
Copy that.

1339
01:25:41,496 --> 01:25:44,192
我到船舱了，再等一下
- Scotty! - I'm in the hangar. Give me a minute.

1340
01:25:48,236 --> 01:25:50,534
我快跑到了，等等
I'm running. Stand by.

1341
01:26:00,414 --> 01:26:04,544
等等，舰长，这门太小了
Whoa, whoa, hold on, now, Captain.

1342
01:26:01,908 --> 01:26:04,828
This door is very wee. I mean, you know, small.

1343
01:26:04,919 --> 01:26:06,819
超级小，顶多4平方米大
It's four square meters, tops.

1344
01:26:07,088 --> 01:26:10,888
就像从车上跳进桥下的酒杯一样
It's gonna be like jumping out of a moving car,

1345
01:26:09,207 --> 01:26:11,125
off a bridge, into your shot glass.

1346
01:26:11,192 --> 01:26:13,057
没关系，我跳过
It's okay. I've done it before.

1347
01:26:15,096 --> 01:26:18,554
上次是往下跳，我们是跳到一个…呃…
Yeah, it was vertical.

1348
01:26:16,172 --> 01:26:19,092
We jumped onto a... it was a...

1349
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:20,326
不重要啦
It doesn't matter. Scotty...

1350
01:26:20,468 --> 01:26:22,868
你找到手动开关了吗？
Did you find the manual override?

1351
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:23,012
The manual override, Scotty.

1352
01:26:23,271 --> 01:26:24,738
还没啦
Not yet, not yet.

1353
01:26:31,612 --> 01:26:34,911
舰长，两艘船中间有很多残骸
Captain, before you launch, you should be aware there is

1354
01:26:33,273 --> 01:26:35,074
a considerable debris field between our ships.

1355
01:26:35,216 --> 01:26:36,513
史巴克别吵，史考特，好了没？
- Spock, not now. Scotty, you good? - It's not easy!

1356
01:26:36,784 --> 01:26:40,584
没那么简单，等我一下好不好，疯子
Just give me two seconds, all right, you mad bastard!

1357
01:26:48,963 --> 01:26:51,261
告诉我这行得通
Tell me this is gonna work.

1358
01:26:52,133 --> 01:26:55,432
我没把握也没信心这样说
I have neither the information

1359
01:26:53,543 --> 01:26:55,378
nor the confidence to do so, Doctor.

1360
01:26:55,636 --> 01:26:56,933
<i>舰长，请稍候</i>
<i>Okay, Captain, stand by.</i>

1361
01:26:57,305 --> 01:26:58,704
你还真会安慰人啊
Boy, you're a real comfort.

1362
01:27:00,141 --> 01:27:01,938
快点、快点、快点
Come on, come on, come on.

1363
01:27:03,244 --> 01:27:04,711
<i>好了，我可以开门了</i>
Yes!

1364
01:27:03,344 --> 01:27:04,888
<i>Okay, okay! I'm set to open the door.</i>

1365
01:27:05,079 --> 01:27:06,046
准备好了吗？
You ready?

1366
01:27:06,414 --> 01:27:07,711
那你呢？
Are you?

1367
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:12,148
<i>史巴克，开始吧</i>
Spock, pull the trigger.

1368
01:27:13,588 --> 01:27:14,555
是的
Yes, Captain.

1369
01:27:20,328 --> 01:27:21,955
发射程序倒数
Launching activation sequence on

1370
01:27:22,263 --> 01:27:23,230
<i>3</i>
<i>three,</i>

1371
01:27:23,598 --> 01:27:24,724
<i>2</i>
<i>two,</i>

1372
01:27:25,433 --> 01:27:26,400
<i>1</i>
<i>ODE.</i>

1373
01:27:36,844 --> 01:27:39,074
寇克会撞到432方向的物体
Sir, Kirk is headed for collision at .432!

1374
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:41,411
舰长，正前方有残骸
Captain, there is debris directly ahead.

1375
01:27:41,515 --> 01:27:42,982
收到
Copy that.

1376
01:27:46,654 --> 01:27:47,951
吉姆，你偏离航道了
Whoa! Jim, you're way off course!

1377
01:27:48,189 --> 01:27:50,157
我知道！我看得出来
I know, I know! I can see that.

1378
01:27:59,967 --> 01:28:01,264
不许动
Don't move.

1379
01:28:03,704 --> 01:28:08,334
用屏幕上的罗盘，你要修正37.243度
Use your display compass, Captain.

1380
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:06,240
You must correct precisely

1381
01:28:06,324 --> 01:28:08,409
- 37.243 degrees. - Got it.

1382
01:28:08,643 --> 01:28:10,406
我正在往回修正
I'm working my way back.

1383
01:28:12,647 --> 01:28:14,342
史考特，你会开门吧？
Scotty, you're gonna be ready with that door, right?

1384
01:28:15,650 --> 01:28:16,947
你在这做什么？
What are you doing in here?

1385
01:28:17,652 --> 01:28:20,951
来修理这个闸门控制台，你个子真高
Wee bit of maintenance on the airlock console. You're big.

1386
01:28:21,255 --> 01:28:22,552
史考特，你在哪里？
Mr. Scott, where are you?

1387
01:28:22,823 --> 01:28:26,452
舰长，他好像听不到你，我重新接通他
Captain, he can't seem to hear you.

1388
01:28:24,175 --> 01:28:26,095
I'm working on getting his signal back. Stand by.

1389
01:28:28,896 --> 01:28:30,523
该死    - <i>怎么了？</i>
<i>- Damn it. - Captain, what is it?</i>

1390
01:28:30,798 --> 01:28:33,164
头盔受损了，乌胡拉，接通史考特没？
My helmet was hit.

1391
01:28:31,808 --> 01:28:33,393
Uhura, tell me you have Mr. Scott back.

1392
01:28:33,501 --> 01:28:34,798
还没
Not yet. I'm still working on a signal.

1393
01:28:35,069 --> 01:28:37,697
<i>通讯器没问题，不知道为什么他不回答</i>
<i>His communicator is working.</i>

1394
01:28:38,005 --> 01:28:38,767
那是什么？
<i>- I don't know why he isn't responding.</i> - What <i>is that?</i>

1395
01:28:39,073 --> 01:28:40,301
你是舰队还是佣兵？
Are you Starfleet or private security?

1396
01:28:40,508 --> 01:28:41,372
另一只手伸出来
Show me your other hand.

1397
01:28:41,475 --> 01:28:42,567
你看起来像佣兵
Because you look like private security.

1398
01:28:42,743 --> 01:28:44,040
很快就要撞上去了
Imminent collision detected!

1399
01:28:44,345 --> 01:28:46,313
可汗，快闪避！前方有残骸
Khan, use evasive action!

1400
01:28:46,614 --> 01:28:47,478
我看到了
- There is debris directly ahead. - I see it.

1401
01:28:54,021 --> 01:28:55,488
苏鲁，可汗死了吗？
Mr. Sulu, did we lose Khan?

1402
01:28:55,856 --> 01:28:58,154
我不知道，残骸太多没办法侦测
I don't know, Commander. I'm having trouble

1403
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,334
tracking him in all this debris.

1404
01:28:59,393 --> 01:29:00,257
可汗被撞了吗？
Was Khan hit?

1405
01:29:00,528 --> 01:29:01,825
我们还在搜寻他
We are trying to find him now.

1406
01:29:02,096 --> 01:29:05,827
舰长你得朝183.473方向前进
Captain, you need to adjust your target destination

1407
01:29:03,756 --> 01:29:06,092
to 183 by 473 degrees.

1408
01:29:17,545 --> 01:29:19,570
我的屏幕坏了，我不能定位
Spock, my display's dead. I'm flying blind.

1409
01:29:20,715 --> 01:29:23,684
没有罗盘的话几乎不可能命中目标
Captain, without your display compass,

1410
01:29:21,858 --> 01:29:23,693
hitting your target destination is mathematically impossible.

1411
01:29:24,285 --> 01:29:25,274
史巴克，等我回来
Spock, if I get back,

1412
01:29:25,419 --> 01:29:26,909
一定要教教你怎么说话
we really need to talk about your bedside manner.

1413
01:29:27,221 --> 01:29:29,189
中校，他不会成功的
Commander, he's not going to make it.

1414
01:29:34,729 --> 01:29:36,356
我的屏幕还是正常的
My display is still functioning.

1415
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:38,257
寇克，你在我前方200米一点钟方向
I see you, Kirk, you're 200 meters ahead of me

1416
01:29:38,566 --> 01:29:41,694
<i>往左转几度然后跟着我</i>
at my one o'clock.

1417
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:41,627
Come to your left a few degrees and follow me.

1418
01:29:54,148 --> 01:29:58,107
我们快到了，你准备好欢迎我们了吗？
Scotty, we're getting close. We need a warm welcome.

1419
01:29:55,808 --> 01:29:58,227
Do you copy? Do you copy? Scotty?

1420
01:29:58,419 --> 01:30:01,388
如果你听得到，10秒后开门
If you can hear us, Mr. Scott,

1421
01:29:59,729 --> 01:30:01,522
- open the door in ten, nine... - Scotty!

1422
01:30:01,822 --> 01:30:03,449
是谁在倒数？
That person counting down,

1423
01:30:03,758 --> 01:30:04,725
是你幻听啦
<i>- what is that? - Eight...</i>

1424
01:30:04,992 --> 01:30:05,583

I think you're hearing things, mate.

1425
01:30:05,726 --> 01:30:06,750
史考特，你在哪里？
- Seven... - Mr. Scott, where are you?

1426
01:30:07,328 --> 01:30:09,728
距离1800米…1600米
- Six, five... - 1,800 meters. 1,600 meters.

1427
01:30:09,964 --> 01:30:11,261
史考特，你死到哪去了？    - 3…
- Scotty, where are you? - Three...

1428
01:30:11,499 --> 01:30:13,057
你听得到吗，史考特！
- Do you copy, Scotty? Please! <i>- Two...</i>

1429
01:30:13,334 --> 01:30:14,494
真的很抱歉    - 什么？
- Sorry about this. - About what?

1430
01:30:14,668 --> 01:30:15,896
史考特，快开门！    - 开门啊！
- Mr. Scott, open the door! - Open the door!

1431
01:30:16,003 --> 01:30:17,334
<i>就是现在！</i>
Mr. Scott, now!

1432
01:30:38,959 --> 01:30:40,256
欢迎光临
Welcome aboard.

1433
01:30:42,296 --> 01:30:43,593
史考特，真高兴能见到你
- It's good to see you, Scotty. - Who is that?

1434
01:30:43,864 --> 01:30:44,956
这谁啊？

1435
01:30:46,967 --> 01:30:48,594
这是史考特，这是可汗
Khan, Scotty. Scotty, Khan.

1436
01:30:48,869 --> 01:30:49,995
哈啰
Hello.

1437
01:30:50,805 --> 01:30:52,136
他们会发现我们的
They'll know we're here.

1438
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:54,173
我知道去舰桥的快捷方式
I know the best way to the bridge.

1439
01:30:58,045 --> 01:30:59,672
光炮锁在电晕的程度
It's locked to stun.

1440
01:30:59,980 --> 01:31:01,277
他们可不会这么好心
Theirs won't be.

1441
01:31:01,549 --> 01:31:03,176
那就不要被他们射中
Try not to get shot.

1442
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:09,118
中校，已经连上线了
Commander, I have that transmission as requested.

1443
01:31:09,490 --> 01:31:11,117
请接上屏幕
On screen, please.

1444
01:31:11,492 --> 01:31:12,618
稍候
Stand by.

1445
01:31:18,833 --> 01:31:20,130
史巴克，你好
<i>Mr. Spock.</i>

1446
01:31:21,669 --> 01:31:22,966
史巴克，你好
Mr. Spock.

1447
01:31:27,508 --> 01:31:28,702
上将
Admiral.

1448
01:31:31,846 --> 01:31:33,370
我晚点再来处置你…
I'll deal with you in a...

1449
01:31:35,516 --> 01:31:37,814
我以当你女儿为耻
I am ashamed to be your daughter.

1450
01:31:41,589 --> 01:31:44,319
第13层的一个船舱门刚被打开
Sir, we just had a hangar door open on deck 13.

1451
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:46,986
可汗
Khan.

1452
01:31:47,261 --> 01:31:49,320
他们都要恢复动力了，我们还用走的？
They're going to have full power and we're walking?

1453
01:31:49,597 --> 01:31:52,225
坐电梯容易被发现，而且逃不了
The turbolifts are easily tracked

1454
01:31:50,756 --> 01:31:52,175
and Marcus would have us in a cage.

1455
01:31:52,366 --> 01:31:54,561
这信道旁边就是引擎室
This path runs adjacent to the engine room.

1456
01:31:54,869 --> 01:31:57,667
他们在这里开枪会影响曲速核
They know they won't be able to use their weapons here

1457
01:31:57,771 --> 01:31:58,999
所以对我们有利
without destabilizing the warp core,

1458
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:59,098
which gives us the advantage.

1459
01:31:59,273 --> 01:32:00,672
你打哪找到这家伙的？
- Where'd you find this guy? - It's a long story.

1460
01:32:00,774 --> 01:32:02,002
说来话长
<i>I Will be brief.</i>

1461
01:32:02,276 --> 01:32:03,243
<i>我长话短说</i>

1462
01:32:04,378 --> 01:32:07,506
你有没有碰过可汗这个人？
In your travels, did you ever encounter a man named Khan?

1463
01:32:12,286 --> 01:32:15,585
你知道我曾发誓不会告诉你…
<i>As you know,</i>

1464
01:32:13,362 --> 01:32:15,698
<i>I have made a vow never to give you information</i>

1465
01:32:15,890 --> 01:32:18,757
任何会影响你命运的事
<i>that could potentially alter your destiny.</i>

1466
01:32:19,727 --> 01:32:24,357
你的路要由你自己走
<i>Your path is yours to walk, and yours alone.</i>

1467
01:32:28,068 --> 01:32:30,036
话虽如此…
<i>That being said,</i>

1468
01:32:31,238 --> 01:32:35,197
可汗努宁辛格是企业号所碰过…
<i>Khan Noonien Singh is the most dangerous adversary</i>

1469
01:32:35,476 --> 01:32:37,706
最可怕的敌人
<i>the Enterprise ever faced.</i>

1470
01:32:38,412 --> 01:32:40,880
他非常聪明、无情…
<i>He is brilliant, ruthless,</i>

1471
01:32:41,248 --> 01:32:45,878
而且毫不犹豫就会杀光你们
<i>and he will not hesitate to kill</i>

1472
01:32:43,976 --> 01:32:45,937
<i>every single one of you.</i>

1473
01:32:49,757 --> 01:32:51,384
你打败他了吗？
Did you defeat him?

1474
01:32:52,426 --> 01:32:55,725
付出了惨痛的代价才打败他
<i>At great cost. Yes.</i>

1475
01:32:57,765 --> 01:32:58,732
怎么打败的？
How?

1476
01:32:58,999 --> 01:33:00,728
我不想触霉头，不过人都到哪里去了？
I don't mean to tempt fate here, but where is everybody?

1477
01:33:01,001 --> 01:33:03,799
这艘船不需太多人操作，一个人都能飞
The ship is designed to be flown by minimal crew,

1478
01:33:02,703 --> 01:33:03,746
one, if necessary.

1479
01:33:03,829 --> 01:33:05,081
One? I...

1480
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:28,758
你还好吧？    - 还好，可汗呢？
- You all right? - Yeah. Where's Khan?

1481
01:33:34,301 --> 01:33:38,101
找所有高阶医疗和轮机人员去武器室
Lieutenant, I need you to assemble all senior medical

1482
01:33:36,612 --> 01:33:38,213
and engineering staff in the weapons bay.

1483
01:33:39,039 --> 01:33:40,165
好的
All right.

1484
01:33:41,709 --> 01:33:45,446
麦考伊你误触鱼雷的方法，能重复吗？
Dr. McCoy, you inadvertently activated a torpedo.

1485
01:33:45,446 --> 01:33:46,003
麦考伊你误触鱼雷的方法，能重复吗？
Could you replicate the process?

1486
01:33:46,313 --> 01:33:47,780
我干嘛要再来一次？
Why the hell would I want to do that?

1487
01:33:47,881 --> 01:33:49,007
你能不能？
Can you or can you not?

1488
01:33:49,316 --> 01:33:51,944
该死，我是医生，不是鱼雷工程师！
Damn it, man, I'm a doctor, not a torpedo technician!

1489
01:33:52,219 --> 01:33:55,120
就因为你是医生，请仔细听好
The fact that you are a doctor is precisely

1490
01:33:53,421 --> 01:33:55,047
why I need you to listen very carefully.

1491
01:33:56,657 --> 01:33:57,954
他跑哪去了？
Where is he?

1492
01:34:03,497 --> 01:34:04,794
靠！
Shit!

1493
01:34:05,165 --> 01:34:06,462
这里
This way.

1494
01:34:09,336 --> 01:34:11,634
我们一到舰桥就电晕他
The minute we get to the bridge, drop him.

1495
01:34:12,006 --> 01:34:15,203
电晕可汗？我以为他在帮我们
What, stun him? Khan? I thought he was helping us.

1496
01:34:15,509 --> 01:34:17,204
我想应该是我们在帮他
I'm pretty sure we're helping him.

1497
01:34:26,487 --> 01:34:27,784
能源已经恢复了！
Power coming online, sir!

1498
01:34:27,988 --> 01:34:29,785
重新锁定企业号    - 是的
<i>Retarget the Enterprise now.</i>

1499
01:34:29,373 --> 01:34:30,374
Aye, sir.

1500
01:34:44,438 --> 01:34:45,735
别让他爬起来
Make sure he stays down.

1501
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:48,137
借过
- Excuse me. - Yeah.

1502
01:34:52,012 --> 01:34:54,139
马可士上将，你被逮捕了
Admiral Marcus, you're under arrest.

1503
01:34:54,515 --> 01:34:56,142
你不是认真的吧？
You're not actually going to do this, are you?

1504
01:34:57,851 --> 01:34:59,978
上将，站起来
Admiral, get out of the chair.

1505
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:02,688
你先想一想自己在做什么
You better stop and think about what you're doing, Kirk.

1506
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:04,958
想想你在克罗诺斯做了什么
You better think about what you did on Kronos.

1507
01:35:05,426 --> 01:35:09,795
你入侵敌人星球，歼灭克林贡巡逻队
You made an incursion onto an enemy planet!

1508
01:35:08,037 --> 01:35:09,955
You killed a Klingon patrol.

1509
01:35:10,097 --> 01:35:13,225
就算你成功离开，还是免不了开战
Even if you got away without a trace, war is coming.

1510
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:16,799
谁来率领军队？你吗？
And who is going to lead us? You?

1511
01:35:17,171 --> 01:35:21,471
如果没有我坐镇，大家都别想活了！
If I'm not in charge,

1512
01:35:18,839 --> 01:35:21,550
our entire way of life is decimated!

1513
01:35:22,176 --> 01:35:24,644
如果你想要我离开这艘船
So you want me off this ship,

1514
01:35:25,012 --> 01:35:27,139
你就杀了我吧
you better kill me.

1515
01:35:27,514 --> 01:35:29,243
我不会杀你的
I'm not going to kill you, sir.

1516
01:35:30,451 --> 01:35:34,080
但我可以电晕你，把你拖下来
But I could stun your ass and drag you out of that chair.

1517
01:35:34,354 --> 01:35:36,982
我只是不想让你在女儿面前丢脸
I'd rather not do that in front of your daughter.

1518
01:35:40,794 --> 01:35:42,819
你还好吗？    - 还好，舰长
- You all right? - Yes, Captain.

1519
01:35:45,366 --> 01:35:46,409
"- Jim!"

1520
01:35:59,646 --> 01:36:00,613
听我说！
Listen! Wait!

1521
01:36:00,814 --> 01:36:01,838
等等！

1522
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:14,127
你这家伙…
You...

1523
01:36:14,828 --> 01:36:17,797
你应该让我一直冬眠下去
You should have let me sleep.

1524
01:36:23,337 --> 01:36:24,304
舰长在哪里？
Where is the Captain, Mr. Sulu?

1525
01:36:24,671 --> 01:36:27,469
传感器坏了，我找不到他
Our sensor array's down, sir. I can't find him.

1526
01:36:28,709 --> 01:36:30,768
我说得简单一点吧
<i>I'm going to make this very simple for you.</i>

1527
01:36:31,378 --> 01:36:33,346
用我的船员换你船员的命
<i>- Captain. - Your crew for my crew.</i>

1528
01:36:33,647 --> 01:36:34,614
你背叛我们
You betrayed us.

1529
01:36:34,748 --> 01:36:36,716
你还真聪明，史巴克
<i>You are smart, Mr. Spock.</i>

1530
01:36:37,151 --> 01:36:38,448
史巴克，不要…
<i>Spock don't...</i>

1531
01:36:40,988 --> 01:36:44,116
史巴克，把我的船员还我
<i>Mr. Spock, give me my crew.</i>

1532
01:36:44,992 --> 01:36:46,516
他们交给你以后，你要做什么？
And what will you do when you get them?

1533
01:36:46,827 --> 01:36:49,193
继续我们被放逐前的目标
<i>Continue the work we were doing before we were banished.</i>

1534
01:36:49,363 --> 01:36:50,159
按照我所听说的
Which, as I understand it, involves the mass genocide

1535
01:36:50,264 --> 01:36:53,961
也就是消灭你们认为比较落后的生命
of any being you find to be less than superior.

1536
01:36:54,334 --> 01:36:56,302
我该摧毁你吗？
<i>Shall I destroy you, Mr. Spock?</i>

1537
01:36:56,670 --> 01:36:59,298
还是你把我要的交出来？
<i>Or will you give me what I want?</i>

1538
01:37:01,909 --> 01:37:03,706
我们的传送器坏了
We have no transporter capabilities.

1539
01:37:04,011 --> 01:37:05,808
幸好我的还能用
<i>Fortunately mine are perfectly functional.</i>

1540
01:37:06,079 --> 01:37:08,047
解除你的防护罩
<i>Drop your shields.</i>

1541
01:37:08,515 --> 01:37:11,712
这样我就不能确保企业号的安全
If I do so, I have no guarantee

1542
01:37:10,284 --> 01:37:11,994
that you will not destroy the Enterprise.

1543
01:37:12,019 --> 01:37:14,487
那我们用逻辑来思考吧
Well, let's play this out logically then, Mr. Spock.

1544
01:37:14,855 --> 01:37:18,154
首先我会杀了你舰长来表示我的决心
Firstly, I will kill your Captain

1545
01:37:16,415 --> 01:37:18,042
to demonstrate my resolve.

1546
01:37:18,525 --> 01:37:23,485
如果你还不顺从，我只好杀了你们全部
Then if yours holds, I will have no choice

1547
01:37:21,086 --> 01:37:23,631
but to kill you and your entire crew.

1548
01:37:23,764 --> 01:37:27,393
如果你摧毁我的船，也会杀死你的人
If you destroy our ship,

1549
01:37:25,549 --> 01:37:27,551
you will also destroy your own people.

1550
01:37:27,701 --> 01:37:30,568
你们需要呼吸，但我船员不必
Your crew requires oxygen to survive, mine does not.

1551
01:37:30,704 --> 01:37:32,171
我只要摧毁…
I will target your life support systems

1552
01:37:32,439 --> 01:37:34,407
…引擎后方的维生系统
located behind the aft nacelle.

1553
01:37:34,708 --> 01:37:37,836
等你们全部都窒息而死…
And after every single person aboard your ship suffocates,

1554
01:37:38,111 --> 01:37:40,579
我就会踩着你们冰冷的尸体
I will walk over your cold corpses to recover my people.

1555
01:37:40,714 --> 01:37:42,409
把我的人救回来

1556
01:37:45,052 --> 01:37:46,417
所以…
Now,

1557
01:37:47,221 --> 01:37:49,189
可以开始了吗？
shall we begin?

1558
01:37:53,227 --> 01:37:54,524
解除防护罩
Lower shields.

1559
01:37:58,465 --> 01:38:00,365
很明智的决定
A wise choice, Mr. Spock.

1560
01:38:08,408 --> 01:38:11,104
我看到72枚鱼雷还在发射管里面
I see your 72 torpedoes are still in their tubes.

1561
01:38:11,578 --> 01:38:13,876
如果那不是我的，我会发现的
If they are not mine, Commander, I will know it.

1562
01:38:14,147 --> 01:38:16,274
瓦肯人是不说谎的
Vulcans do not lie.

1563
01:38:17,584 --> 01:38:19,552
那些就是你的鱼雷
The torpedoes are yours.

1564
01:38:30,197 --> 01:38:31,824
谢啦，史巴克
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

1565
01:38:32,199 --> 01:38:34,326
我已经照你说的做了
I have fulfilled your terms.

1566
01:38:34,868 --> 01:38:36,199
换你了
Now fulfill mine.

1567
01:38:37,304 --> 01:38:38,828
寇克…
Well, Kirk,

1568
01:38:39,473 --> 01:38:41,600
你该回你船上去了
it seems apt to return you to your crew.

1569
01:38:42,542 --> 01:38:43,839
毕竟…
After all,

1570
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:50,145
舰长应该和船共存亡
no ship should go down without her captain.

1571
01:38:52,819 --> 01:38:54,286
他用光炮锁定我们了！
He's locking phasers on us, sir!

1572
01:39:00,494 --> 01:39:02,462
快放我们出去！
Let us out of here now!

1573
01:39:10,737 --> 01:39:12,364
防护罩只剩6％！
Shields at 6%!

1574
01:39:12,673 --> 01:39:14,766
那些鱼雷！还要多久？
The torpedoes! How much time, Lieutenant?

1575
01:39:14,941 --> 01:39:15,908
12秒
Twelve seconds, sir!

1576
01:39:16,009 --> 01:39:16,805
所有船员准备
<i>Crew of the Enterprise,</i>

1577
01:39:17,210 --> 01:39:18,507
将有爆炸冲击波
prepare for imminent proximity detonation.

1578
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:20,539
他说什么？什么爆炸？
What's he talking about? What detonation?

1579
01:39:20,847 --> 01:39:22,872
是鱼雷，他启动鱼雷了！
The torpedoes. He armed the damn torpedoes!

1580
01:39:33,218 --> 01:39:34,219
No!

1581
01:39:41,435 --> 01:39:42,663
他们的武器系统被炸坏了
Sir, their weapons have been knocked out.

1582
01:39:44,104 --> 01:39:46,163
中校，这招不错    - 谢谢
- Not bad, Commander. - Thank you, Lieutenant.

1583
01:39:46,873 --> 01:39:47,999
老骨头！
- Bones! - Bones!

1584
01:39:48,542 --> 01:39:49,839
护士！
- Nurse! - I got you. I got you.

1585
01:39:50,744 --> 01:39:52,041
马可士博士
Dr. Marcus.

1586
01:39:54,448 --> 01:39:55,415
吉姆，真高兴见到你
Good to see you, Jim.

1587
01:39:55,982 --> 01:39:57,347
你帮史巴克引爆鱼雷的？
You helped Spock detonate those torpedoes?

1588
01:39:57,451 --> 01:39:58,281
当然啰
Damn right I did.

1589
01:39:58,385 --> 01:39:59,682
他杀了可汗的船员了！
He killed Khan's crew!

1590
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:01,583
他冷漠，但不残忍
Spock's cold, but he's not that cold.

1591
01:40:02,022 --> 01:40:03,853
可汗的人在我这
I've got Khan's crew.

1592
01:40:04,124 --> 01:40:08,891
72根人型棒冰，好好的躺在冬眠舱里
Seventy-two human popsicles

1593
01:40:06,585 --> 01:40:09,088
safe and sound in their cryo tubes.

1594
01:40:09,796 --> 01:40:11,093
这小子！
Son of a bitch!

1595
01:40:17,237 --> 01:40:18,534
我们主动力网故障了！
Sir, the central power grid is failing!

1596
01:40:18,672 --> 01:40:19,900
转用辅助动力
- Switch to auxiliary power. - Auxiliary power failing, sir.

1597
01:40:20,374 --> 01:40:21,932
辅助动力也不行了

1598
01:40:29,483 --> 01:40:31,451
我们进入地球的重力范围里了
Commander, our ship's caught in Earth's gravity!

1599
01:40:31,718 --> 01:40:32,548
能停下来吗？
- Can we stop? - I can't do anything.

1600
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:33,777
我无能为力

1601
01:40:43,163 --> 01:40:44,915
Sorry! Oh, no.

1602
01:40:45,132 --> 01:40:46,224
赶快疏散！
Clear the area!

1603
01:40:46,933 --> 01:40:49,731
紧急锁定！希望你不会晕船
Engage emergency lockdown! I hope you don't get seasick.

1604
01:40:50,003 --> 01:40:51,800
你会吗？    - 会
- Do you? - Yeah.

1605
01:40:52,072 --> 01:40:53,699
发布弃船警告
Lieutenant, sound evacuation, all decks.

1606
01:40:53,799 --> 01:40:54,800
Aye, sir.

1607
01:40:55,909 --> 01:40:59,538
身为代理舰长，我下令弃船
As acting Captain, I order you to abandon this ship.

1608
01:41:00,914 --> 01:41:04,213
我会留在这控制维生系统和逃生舱
I will remain behind and divert all power

1609
01:41:03,016 --> 01:41:04,393
to life support and evacuation shuttle bays.

1610
01:41:04,518 --> 01:41:06,145
<i>Evacuation protocols...</i>

1611
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:08,718
我命令你们弃船！
I order you to abandon the ship!

1612
01:41:08,989 --> 01:41:12,049
恕我冒犯，但我们也要留下来
All due respect, Commander, but we're not going anywhere.

1613
01:41:12,276 --> 01:41:13,902
<i>Attention all decks.</i>

1614
01:41:13,986 --> 01:41:15,863
<i>Evacuation protocols initiated.</i>

1615
01:41:16,096 --> 01:41:18,963
我才离开一天！一天而已！
One day I've been off this ship! One bloody day!

1616
01:41:23,136 --> 01:41:25,331
重力系统故障，抓稳了
Gravity systems are failing. Hold on! Hold on!

1617
01:41:29,009 --> 01:41:32,604
<i>所有船员注意，撤退程序启动</i>
<i>Attention, all decks.</i>

1618
01:41:30,836 --> 01:41:32,296
<i>Evacuation protocols initiated.</i>

1619
01:41:32,979 --> 01:41:36,005
<i>到指定航天飞机报到准备离舰</i>
<i>Proceed to exit bays</i>

1620
01:41:34,506 --> 01:41:36,466
<i>- and report to your assigned shuttle.</i>

1621
01:41:36,383 --> 01:41:41,013
如果没动力来稳住这艘船，谁也逃不了
There won't be time for evacuation

1622
01:41:37,843 --> 01:41:41,013
if we don't get power to stabilize the damn ship!

1623
01:41:41,288 --> 01:41:43,620
可以恢复吗？    - 要去轮机室
- Can we restore it? - Only from engineering.

1624
01:41:43,857 --> 01:41:46,325
我们得到曲速核那里
We have to get back to the warp core.

1625
01:41:46,518 --> 01:41:49,062
<i>- Attention all decks.</i>

1626
01:41:49,129 --> 01:41:50,426
吉姆？
Jim?

1627
01:41:51,631 --> 01:41:53,792
史考特，我们得恢复动力，快！
Scotty, we got to get the power back on! Come on!

1628
01:42:11,585 --> 01:42:12,882
史考特，我们要跳过去！
- Scotty, we got to jump! - What?

1629
01:42:13,186 --> 01:42:14,312
跳啊！
Jump! Jump!

1630
01:42:14,554 --> 01:42:15,578
天啊
Oh, God.

1631
01:42:17,390 --> 01:42:20,018
紧急动力剩15％，还在减少中
Emergency power at 15% and dropping.

1632
01:42:20,227 --> 01:42:23,196
<i>所有船员注意，撤退程序启动</i>
<i>Attention, all decks.</i>

<i>到指定航天飞机报到准备离舰</i>
<i>Proceed to exit bays and report to your assigned shuttle.</i>

1635
01:42:39,579 --> 01:42:40,978
吉姆？    - 撑住！
- Jim? - Hold on!

1636
01:42:41,348 --> 01:42:42,645
我不行了
I can't.

1637
01:43:01,234 --> 01:43:02,701
舰长我来了！
I've got you, Captain!

1638
01:43:02,969 --> 01:43:04,527
契可夫    - 别放手！
- Chekov. - Don't let go!

1639
01:43:15,649 --> 01:43:18,209
就算曲速核上线，还得转接能源输出
Even if we get the warp core online, we've still got to redirect the power!

1640
01:43:18,485 --> 01:43:19,952
他说的对！    - 什么意思？
- He's right, Captain! - What are you talking about?

1641
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:23,721
有人得去用手动开关，那是在…
Someone has to hit the manual override.

1642
01:43:23,924 --> 01:43:25,892
…偏导碟的后方！我去！
Laddie, there's a switch...

1643
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:26,034
Behind the deflector dish! I'll flip the switch!

1644
01:43:26,159 --> 01:43:27,524
我们走吧！
Let's go!

1645
01:43:30,455 --> 01:43:31,456
Oh, no.

1646
01:43:35,711 --> 01:43:37,963
<i>Ov-vov! Ov-vov! Ov-vov-vov!</i>

1647
01:43:42,742 --> 01:43:47,611
<i>撤退程序启动，到指定航天飞机报到</i>
<i>Evacuation protocols initiated.</i>

01:43:45,637 --> 01:43:48,307
<i>Proceed to exit bays and report to your assigned shuttle.</i>

1649
01:43:50,216 --> 01:43:52,116
苏鲁，所有动力转入稳定器
Mr. Sulu, divert any remaining power to stabilizers.

1650
01:43:52,419 --> 01:43:53,943
我尽力在做
Doing what I can, sir. Doing what I can.

1651
01:44:10,337 --> 01:44:13,067
<i>曲速核校准偏离，危险</i>
<i>Core misaligned. Danger.</i>

1652
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:14,907
噢不，完了！
- Oh, no, no, no, no! - What?

1653
01:44:15,175 --> 01:44:18,235
框架歪了！没办法转接动力了！
The housings are misaligned!

1654
01:44:16,585 --> 01:44:18,503
There's no way we can redirect the power!

1655
01:44:18,511 --> 01:44:21,480
这艘船完蛋了，没救了
The ship's dead, sir. She's gone.

1656
01:44:22,949 --> 01:44:24,473
还有救
- No, she's not. - Wait, Jim!

1657
01:44:24,951 --> 01:44:29,581
进去就死定了！辐射会杀了我们！
If we go in there, we'll die!

1658
01:44:27,638 --> 01:44:29,681
Do you hear me? The radiation will kill us!

1659
01:44:29,856 --> 01:44:31,915
你听我说好不好？你到底想干什么？
Will you listen to me? What the hell are you doing?

1660
01:44:32,192 --> 01:44:33,159
我要进去
I'm opening the door. I'm going in.

1661
01:44:33,460 --> 01:44:35,621
这道门就是为了防止辐射外泄
That door is there to stop us from getting irradiated!

1662
01:44:35,729 --> 01:44:37,993
我们还没爬上去就会死掉！
We'd be dead before we made the climb!

1663
01:44:40,467 --> 01:44:41,764
我没有要你爬
You're not making the climb.

1664
01:44:43,028 --> 01:44:45,739
<i>Danger. Core misaligned.</i>

1665
01:44:46,539 --> 01:44:48,507
<i>曲速核校准偏离</i>
<i>Danger. Core misaligned.</i>

1666
01:45:47,801 --> 01:45:49,769
如果没动力或防护罩
If we don't get power or shields back online,

1667
01:45:49,869 --> 01:45:51,996
我们会烧死在大气层
we're gonna be incinerated on re-entry!

1668
01:46:59,038 --> 01:47:00,062
曲速核上线了！
Warp core is back online!

1669
01:47:00,373 --> 01:47:01,840
苏鲁，推进器开到最大！
Maximum thrusters, Mr. Sulu!

1670
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:09,378
已开到最大！请稍候
Thrusters at maximum! Stand by! Stand by!

1671
01:47:36,743 --> 01:47:38,836
防护罩恢复了！    - 我们有动力了
- Shields restored! - Commander, power online.

1672
01:47:39,212 --> 01:47:41,180
高度稳住了
Mr. Spock, altitude stabilizing.

1673
01:47:41,548 --> 01:47:43,345
这真是奇迹
It's a miracle.

1674
01:47:45,385 --> 01:47:47,353
没有奇迹这种事
There are no such things.

1675
01:47:49,556 --> 01:47:51,854
<i>轮机室呼叫舰桥，史巴克！</i>
<i>Engineering to bridge.</i>

1676
01:47:52,392 --> 01:47:55,293
<i>你最好过来这里</i>
- Mr. <i>Spock!</i> - Mr. Scott.

1677
01:47:52,467 --> 01:47:55,387
<i>Sir, you'd better get down here.</i>

1678
01:47:55,562 --> 01:47:56,859
<i>越快越好</i>
<i>Better hurry.</i>

1679
01:48:19,519 --> 01:48:20,486
把门打开
Open it.

1680
01:48:20,753 --> 01:48:22,380
污染清除程序还没完成
The decontamination process is not complete.

1681
01:48:22,522 --> 01:48:25,719
辐射会扩散到整个区域，门已上锁
You'd flood the whole compartment.

1682
01:48:23,832 --> 01:48:25,876
The door's locked, sir.

1683
01:48:55,288 --> 01:48:56,346
我们的船怎么样了？
How's our ship?

1684
01:48:58,124 --> 01:48:59,591
安全了
Out of danger.

1685
01:49:02,128 --> 01:49:04,028
你救了所有船员
You saved the crew.

1686
01:49:05,798 --> 01:49:08,596
你利用他最想要的东西对付他
You used what he wanted against him.

1687
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:14,436
那招很棒
That's a nice move.

1688
01:49:16,142 --> 01:49:18,110
换作是你也会那么做
It is what you would have done.

1689
01:49:19,979 --> 01:49:21,207
而这…
And this,

1690
01:49:22,815 --> 01:49:24,783
…换作是你也会这么做
this is what you would have done.

1691
01:49:25,151 --> 01:49:27,278
这么做很合逻辑
It was only logical.

1692
01:49:33,660 --> 01:49:35,389
我很害怕，史巴克
I'm scared, Spock.

1693
01:49:39,098 --> 01:49:40,793
教我如何不害怕
Help me not be.

1694
01:49:45,271 --> 01:49:47,569
你是怎么选择不去感觉？
How do you choose not to feel?

1695
01:49:54,347 --> 01:49:55,974
我不知道
I do not know.

1696
01:49:58,851 --> 01:50:00,819
我现在没办法控制
Right now I am failing.

1697
01:50:07,627 --> 01:50:10,653
我希望你了解为什么我不能任由你丧命
I want you to know why I couldn't let you die.

1698
01:50:14,734 --> 01:50:16,463
为什么我一定要去救你
Why I went back for you.

1699
01:50:18,371 --> 01:50:20,669
因为你是我的朋友
Because you are my friend.

1700
01:51:44,624 --> 01:51:47,252
可汗！
Khan!

1701
01:51:49,962 --> 01:51:51,122
哇靠，差点撞到！
God, that was close!

1702
01:51:54,467 --> 01:51:58,699
设定目标，星舰总部！
Set destination, Starfleet Headquarters!

1703
01:51:58,971 --> 01:52:02,202
<i>引擎故障，无法保证能抵达目标</i>
<i>Engines compromised.</i>

1704
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:02,300
<i>Cannot guarantee destination.</i>

1705
01:52:02,408 --> 01:52:03,773
<i>请确认指令</i>
<i>Confirm order.</i>

1706
01:52:04,077 --> 01:52:05,305
确定
Confirm.

1707
01:53:09,775 --> 01:53:11,970
搜寻敌舰的生命迹象
Search the enemy ship for signs of life.

1708
01:53:12,278 --> 01:53:14,803
不可能有人活下来的
Sir, there's no way anyone survived.

1709
01:53:15,481 --> 01:53:16,448
可汗就有可能
He could.

1710
01:53:17,350 --> 01:53:18,317
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

1711
01:53:50,149 --> 01:53:51,776
哇！他一跳就30米！
Whoa! He just jumped 30 meters!

1712
01:53:51,984 --> 01:53:52,951
能不能把他传送上来？
Can we beam him up?

1713
01:53:53,219 --> 01:53:55,517
故障太严重了，没办法锁定
There's too much damage.

1714
01:53:54,370 --> 01:53:55,747
I have no incoming signal.

1715
01:53:55,888 --> 01:53:58,686
可是应该还可以把你传送下去
But it may be possible to beam you down, sir.

1716
01:53:59,258 --> 01:54:00,225
去抓他吧
Go get him.

1717
01:54:05,598 --> 01:54:07,225
准备接收坐标
- Stand by for coordinates. - Yes, sir.

1718
01:54:08,467 --> 01:54:10,833
输入3517-2598
Enter 3517 by 2598.

1719
01:54:11,070 --> 01:54:12,833
坐标确认
Coordinates confirmed.

1720
01:55:51,037 --> 01:55:52,834
快拿一个冬眠舱给我
Get me a cryo tube, now!

1721
01:56:48,394 --> 01:56:51,454
把这个人抬出来，用药物维持昏迷
Get this guy out of the cryo tube.

1722
01:56:51,731 --> 01:56:54,791
把寇克放进去，这样才能保住他脑功能
Keep him in an induced coma.

1723
01:56:51,756 --> 01:56:53,216
We're gonna put Kirk inside.

1724
01:56:53,299 --> 01:56:55,009
It's our only chance to preserve his brain function.

1725
01:56:55,067 --> 01:56:57,968
可汗的血还剩多少？    - 一滴也不剩
How much of Khan's blood is left?

1726
01:56:57,053 --> 01:56:58,054
None.

1727
01:56:58,904 --> 01:57:01,702
企业号呼叫史巴克！
<i>Enterprise to Spock. Spoon!</i>

1728
01:58:02,835 --> 01:58:04,962
启动冬眠程序
Activate the cryogenic sequence.

1729
01:58:07,006 --> 01:58:08,633
麦考伊呼叫舰桥
McCoy to bridge.

1730
01:58:09,008 --> 01:58:10,236
我联络不到史巴克
I can't reach Spock. I need Khan alive.

1731
01:58:10,342 --> 01:58:11,468
要他留可汗活口
You get that son of a bitch back on board right now!

1732
01:58:11,777 --> 01:58:14,746
把那混蛋抓回船上！

1733
01:58:15,681 --> 01:58:16,978
他可能可以救寇克
I think he can save Kirk.

1734
01:58:17,383 --> 01:58:18,577
能不能把他们传送上来？
Can we beam them up to the ship?

1735
01:58:18,684 --> 01:58:20,914
他们一直移动，两个都没办法锁定
They keep moving! I can't get a lock on either of them.

1736
01:58:21,187 --> 01:58:22,484
那能不能把人传送下去？
Can you beam someone down?

1737
01:58:57,423 --> 01:58:58,390
史巴克！
Spock!

1738
01:59:05,931 --> 01:59:06,863
史巴克！
Spock!

1739
01:59:07,333 --> 01:59:08,925
史巴克，住手！
Spock, stop! Stop!

1740
01:59:09,335 --> 01:59:11,860
只有他能救寇克
He's our only chance to save Kirk!

1741
01:59:21,714 --> 01:59:24,012
<i>是男还是女？    - 男孩</i>
<i>- What is it? </i>- It's a <i>boy.</i>

1742
01:59:24,383 --> 01:59:25,350
<i>就叫他吉姆</i>
<i>Let's call him Jim.</i>

1743
01:59:25,651 --> 01:59:27,676
<i>你父亲只当了12分钟舰长</i>
<i>Your father was captain of a starship for 12 minutes.</i>

1744
01:59:27,887 --> 01:59:29,684
<i>但是救了八百人</i>
<i>He saved 800 lives. I dare you to do better.</i>

1745
01:59:29,822 --> 01:59:31,687
<i>你能做得比他更好吗？</i>

1746
01:59:40,866 --> 01:59:43,835
别这么惊讶，你只是死了一下下而已
Don't be so melodramatic. You were barely dead.

1747
01:59:44,069 --> 01:59:46,299
现在只是输血的后遗症
It was the transfusion that really took it's toll.

1748
01:59:46,705 --> 01:59:48,673
你昏迷了两个星期    - 输血？
You were out cold for two weeks.

1749
01:59:48,841 --> 01:59:51,708
你辐射伤害太严重，没别的办法
Transfusion?

1750
01:59:49,058 --> 01:59:51,769
Your cells were heavily irradiated. We had no choice.

1751
01:59:52,511 --> 01:59:53,705
可汗的血？
Khan?

1752
01:59:54,079 --> 01:59:57,537
我们抓到他以后，用他的血合成出药剂
Once we caught him,

1753
01:59:55,189 --> 01:59:57,817
I synthesized a serum from his superblood.

1754
01:59:57,850 --> 02:00:01,718
你会不会想杀人？或极度渴望权力
Tell me, are you feeling homicidal?

1755
02:00:00,570 --> 02:00:02,113
Power mad? Despotic?

1756
02:00:02,087 --> 02:00:03,714
没有特别想
No more than usual.

1757
02:00:04,356 --> 02:00:05,482
你怎么抓到他的？
How'd you catch him?

1758
02:00:05,925 --> 02:00:07,222
不是我抓的
I didn't.

1759
02:00:16,101 --> 02:00:17,659
你救了我一命
You saved my life.

1760
02:00:17,903 --> 02:00:20,371
乌胡拉和我也帮了不少忙耶
Uhura and I had something to do with it, too, you know.

1761
02:00:22,174 --> 02:00:24,369
你也救过我，还有全船的…
You saved my life, Captain. And the lives...

1762
02:00:24,677 --> 02:00:25,974
史巴克…
Spock, just...

1763
02:00:27,746 --> 02:00:29,043
谢谢你
Thank you.

1764
02:00:30,416 --> 02:00:32,543
不客气，吉姆
You are welcome, Jim.

1765
02:00:43,395 --> 02:00:46,762
<i>永远都会有人想伤害我们</i>
<i>There will always be those who mean to do us harm.</i>

1766
02:00:48,734 --> 02:00:50,099
<i>为了阻止他们…</i>
<i>To stop them,</i>

1767
02:00:50,736 --> 02:00:54,604
<i>我们可能会冒险唤醒自身的邪恶</i>
<i>we risk awakening the same evil within ourselves.</i>

1768
02:01:00,646 --> 02:01:02,876
当挚爱被剥夺的当下
<i>Our first instinct is to seek revenge</i>

1769
02:01:02,982 --> 02:01:05,610
我们马上会想到复仇
<i>when those we love are taken from us.</i>

1770
02:01:08,654 --> 02:01:10,349
但那不是我们的本性
<i>But that's not who we are.</i>

1771
02:01:12,024 --> 02:01:13,389
今天我们来参加…
<i>We are here today</i>

1772
02:01:13,659 --> 02:01:16,423
企业号的复航典礼
<i>to rechristen the U.S.S. Enterprise,</i>

1773
02:01:16,795 --> 02:01:19,593
并且向一年前的…
<i>and to honor those who lost their lives</i>

1774
02:01:20,532 --> 02:01:22,124
…罹难者致敬
<i>nearly one year ago.</i>

1775
02:01:22,768 --> 02:01:24,895
当帕克把他的船交给我的时候
<i>When Christopher Pike first gave me his ship</i>

1776
02:01:25,004 --> 02:01:27,404
他要我朗读舰长的誓言
<i>he had me recite the Captain's Oath,</i>

1777
02:01:28,340 --> 02:01:31,138
当时我并不在意那些话
<i>words I didn't appreciate at the time.</i>

1778
02:01:31,844 --> 02:01:34,836
但我现在了解，那是要提醒我们…
<i>Now I see them as a call for us to remember</i>

1779
02:01:35,714 --> 02:01:37,511
我们的本质…
<i>who we once were,</i>

1780
02:01:39,451 --> 02:01:41,817
和我们所信守的理念
<i>and who we must be again.</i>

1781
02:01:43,122 --> 02:01:44,589
<i>那段话就是…</i>
<i>And those words?</i>

1782
02:01:45,290 --> 02:01:48,316
<i>太空，人类的终极边疆</i>
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

1783
02:01:48,794 --> 02:01:52,491
<i>这些是星舰企业号的旅程</i>
<i>These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.</i>

1784
02:01:53,365 --> 02:01:54,923
<i>它未来的五年任务</i>
<i>Her five-year mission,</i>

1785
02:01:55,300 --> 02:01:57,165
<i>是为了探索陌生的新世界</i>
<i>to explore strange new worlds,</i>

1786
02:01:57,870 --> 02:02:01,328
<i>寻找新生命和新文明</i>
<i>to seek out new life and new civilizations,</i>

1787
02:02:02,041 --> 02:02:05,772
<i>勇敢航向人类足迹从未踏至的领域</i>
<i>to boldly go where no one has gone before.</i>

1788
02:02:08,814 --> 02:02:10,679
舰长抵达舰桥
Captain on the bridge.

1789
02:02:13,819 --> 02:02:17,448
一坐上去就放不下了，对吧？
It's hard to get out of it once you've had a taste,

1790
02:02:16,288 --> 02:02:17,790
isn't that right, Mr. Sulu?

1791
02:02:17,823 --> 02:02:19,848
舰长这头衔是蛮好听的
