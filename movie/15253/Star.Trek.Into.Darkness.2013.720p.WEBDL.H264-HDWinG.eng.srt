00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,890 
That our vehicles! 
You disable our vehicles! 

4
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,590 
Oh, great! 

5
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,570 
Run! 

6
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,270 
You take what! 

7
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,690 
I do not know, 
but they worship. 

8
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,990 
Kirk, the Ship One. 

9
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,520 
Residents have come out of the danger area. 
Continue the operation. 

10
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,050 
Spock, that's where, neutralize the mountain 
berapinya and let's go from here. 

11
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,360 
Must now! 
I said to the Captain 
ship can not stand this heat. 

12
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,350 
Captain, native creatures see? 

13
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,960 
No, Tn. 
Spock. 

14
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,620 
Commandment says 
there should be no interference - 

15
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,320 
I know! 
That's why I penetrate 
forest with a pseudonym! 

16
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,790 
Ice throw your super 
and we went! 
Kirk out! 

17
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,490 
You can do. 

18
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,620 
If you want to do this, 
now is the time! 

19
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,510 
Abu is damaging our coils. 

20
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,300 
Want me to go? 

21
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,290 
That makes no sense. 
I've - 

22
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,580 
Spock, I'm kidding. 

23
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,990 
- You can do it. 
- We have to go now! 

24
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,030 
They want to kill us! 

25
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,950 
They want to kill us, Jim! 

26
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,930 
See you 90 seconds longer. 

27
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,300 
Do it, do it, do it! 

28
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,460 
MACHINE heat 

29
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,960 
I can not hold this position 
Spock, I have to drag you. 

30
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,530 
No. 
It's the only chance 
to save this species. 

31
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,570 
If the mountain is erupting, 
this planet dies. 
31, 
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,040 
Pull him. 
Now! 

32
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,900 
<i> Spock, are you all right? </ i> 

33
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,470 
I ... 

34
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,550 
... Still alive. 
Wait. 

35
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,760 
We have to pull it. 
I put on my costume and go down. 

36
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,740 
We must leave this ship. 

37
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,840 
- We can not leave him! 
- We have no choice! 

38
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,190 
Uhura, I'm sorry. 

39
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,680 
Spock. 
We are going to the Enterprise. 
We'll get you out. 

40
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,060 
Captain, I left the ship. 
You have to Enterprise alone. 

41
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,220 
<i> Good! </ i> 

42
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,190 
- Uhura! 
Are you ready to swim? 
- I'm ready. 

43
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,810 
Jim! 
Beaches that way! 

44
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,000 
I know, but 
we are not to the beach! 

45
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,760 
No, no, no. 

46
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,820 
I hate this! 

47
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,460 
I know! 

48
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,920 
You know how ridiculous 
hide planes in the ocean? 

49
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,910 
We down here since last night! 

50
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,290 
Scotty! 
Where's Spock? 

51
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,060 
Still on the volcano, sir. 

52
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,900 
<i> captain on the bridge. </ i> 

53
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,930 
Lieutenant. 
There is an open channel to Tn. 
Spock? 

54
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,100 
Faulty communication 
because of the heat, but no contact. 

55
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,220 

56
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,050 
Active appliance. 
It's time countdown, Captain ... 

57
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,840 
reaction would 
appease the volcano. 

58
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,230 
It also would ease it. 

59
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,420 
Sender can use the tool? 

60
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,950 
No, 
no magnetic field. 

61
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,810 
I need to send a ship to Spock. 
Give me how. 

62
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,890 
Maybe if we see it directly. 
If we approached. 

63
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,920 
Into an active volcano? 
If erupts 
I assure you we are not heat resistant. 

64
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,600 
I wonder what we could 
maintain altitude. 

65
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,450 
Ashes to cover our vessel, 
but the Enterprise is too big. 

66
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,170 
If used for 
will rescue 

67
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,690 
seen by native species. 

68
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,350 
Spock, you at least know the rules, 
but there must be exceptions 

69
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,230 
It violated 
Commandment. 

70
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,050 
Shut up Spock! 
We are trying to help you! 

71
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,960 
Doctorate, the interests of many people 
more important than a few people. 

72
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,690 
Spock, we're talking about your life! 

73
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,810 
Rules can not be broken - 

74
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,840 
Spock! 

75
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,520 
Try to contact him again. 

76
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,730 
90 seconds before the explosion, sir. 

77
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,870 
If Spock here and I'm there, 
what will he do? 

78
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,450 
He will let you die. 

79
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,780 

80
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,390 
Are you okay? 

81
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,610 
Captain, did you leave the control room? 

82
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,130 
He's fine. 

83
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,330 
- Automated reporting sir? 
- Yes, please. 

84
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,540 
What is Commander Spock aboard sir? 

85
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,840 
- No less than one. 
- Tell, detonator successfully. 

86
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,480 
<i> Did you hear that? 
Congratulations, Spock. </ I> 

87
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,230 
You saved the world. 

88
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,320 
You're breaking the First Commandment. 

89
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,740 
Come on, Spock. 
That's not a problem.

Oh, Jim. 
Come on.

Spock, For this is he phone. 
I can feel it. 

102
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,150 
Besides firasatmu 
I think there may be 

103
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,130 
we selected for the new program. 

104
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,300 
To what Pike would like to meet? 

105
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,690 
They gave us the best 
latest. 
Who else do they send? 

106
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,340 
There are several possibilities. 

107
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,810 
Five-year mission, Spock! 

108
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,870 
Outer space! 
Foreign territory! 
Think how great it 

109
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,960 
Hey, ladies, Jim Kirk. 

110
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,630 
- "It was okay." 
- What, Admiral? 

111
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,240 
So your explanation about 
Nibiru survey in the journal captain. 

112
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,160 
I do not want to waste 
your time with the details. 

113
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,210 
Tell me about the mountain. 
According to data from an active mountain. 

114
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,880 
If the burst 
will destroy the planet. 

115
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,870 
I hope not, sir. 

116
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,310 
I think it will not explode. 

117
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,850 
Change is relative, sir. 
The data may be inaccurate. 

118
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:38,540 
Or maybe Mr.. 
Spock blow 
cold fusion device ... 

119
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:43,370 
In it after civilization ... 
is not to reinvent the wheel ... 

120
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,830 
See spacecraft ... 
emerged from the ocean. 

121
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,630 
So your explanation? 

122
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,480 
You file a report? 
Why did not you say? 

123
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,020 
I suspect 
you're going to falsified jurnalmu. 

124
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,830 
I'll be honest if 
I do not have to help you. 

125
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,870 
I'm grateful for it and 
The reason for the charge - 

126
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,610 
Great responsibility. 
It was glorious, 
taper, if you do not displeases me. 

127
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,320 
"Taper"? 
It was an insult to - 

128
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,330 
Gentlemen. 

129
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:13,200 
Starfleet command is exploring 
and observe, not interfere. 

130
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,620 
If the mission as planned, they 
would not know our intervention. 

131
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,870 
It technically. 

132
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,750 
I'm a Vulcan. 
Our technical talk 

133
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,270 
You teach me? 

134
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,540 
I give a lot of lessons, sir. 
Which one do you mean? 

135
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,440 
Out. 

136
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,420 
You may go, Commander. 

137
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,030 
You know how 
annoying you? 

138
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,430 
I guess, yes sir. 

139
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:46,130 
Tell me what your fault. 
What is the lesson here? 

140
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,300 
Do not believe the Vulcan. 

141
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:52,130 
You can not answer the question. 
You lied in official reports. 

142
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,510 
You think the rules do not apply to you 
because you do not agree. 

143
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:58,590 
That's why you want me 
register. 
Why did you give your ship. 

144
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,130 
I'll give you my boat because 
I see great things in you. 

145
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,460 
Now I see 
you still arrogant. 

146
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,140 
- I have to let Spock die? 
- You're missing the point. 

147
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,410 
I do not really, sir. 
What would you do? 

148
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,900 
From the beginning, I would not harm 
My Preferred officer! 

149
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,880 
You're supposed to survey the planet, 
not change the destiny! 

150
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,520 
You're breaking the rules dozens of Starfleet 
and nearly killed awakmu. 

151
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,640 
But no! 
You know 
how much of my crew are dead? 

152
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:28,550 
That's your problem - 
do you think you're perfect! 

153
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,500 
Regulation only for other people! 

154
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,420 
Some do. 

155
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,330 
Even worse, you're desperate 
determine life and death! 

156
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,530 
It is known 
by Admiral Marcus. 

157
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,570 
He held a special session, 
and I was not invited. 

158
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,520 
You know the importance of the trial 
in this case. 

159
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,750 
They took over the Enterprise from you. 

160
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,870 
They send 
back to the Academy. 

161
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360 
Admiral, hearing - 

162
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,850 
I do not want to hear. 
Why? 
You just listen to yourself. 

163
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,340 
- Every decision - 
- I do not want to hear it! 

164
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,670 
You do not follow the rules, 
you're not responsible for anything, 

165
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,810 
And you ... 
not respect your position. 

166
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,300 
You know why? 

167
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,940 
Because you're not ready. 

168
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,810 
How did you find me? 

169
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,250 
I know you better 
than you think. 

170
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,480 
The first time I found you, 
at the bar like this. 

171
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,220 
Remember? 
You're battered. 

172
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,110 
No. 

173
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,780 
- Not? 
- That's not what happened. 

174
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,550 
- You were beaten severely. 
- Not. 

175
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,630 
You plug your nose 
with a napkin. 

176
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,700 
Right? 

177
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,230 
It was exciting fights. 

178
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,680 
"Fighting is exciting." 

179
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,930 
That's your problem. 

180
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,180 
They returned it to me. 

181
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,820 
Enterprise. 

182
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,610 
Congratulations. 

183
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,280 
Beware the Primary Officers. 

184
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,660 
Spock did not work for me. 
He moved. 

185
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,540 
U.S.S. 
Bradbury. 

186
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,670 
You're My Preferred officer. 

187
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,530 
I convinced Marcus. 

188
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,120 
But once in a while I can 
make a good argument. 

189
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,250 
What did you say to him? 

190
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,160 
Truth. 

191
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,430 
That I believe you. 

192
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,390 
If there is inappropriate to 
second chance, Jim Kirk is the man. 

193
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,340 
Either I have to say. 

194
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,750 
It was the first time. 

195
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,130 
All will be fine, kid. 

196
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,110 
"Emergency Session, Daystrom." 

197
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,400 
That's us. 

198
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,400 
Wear uniforms. 

199
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,190 
- Captain. 
- Not anymore, Spock. 
Primary officer. 

200
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,380 
I demoted 
and you moved. 

201
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:19,620 
Fortunately result 
not too severe. 

202
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,190 
You must be kidding. 

203
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,210 
- Captain, I do not intend to - 
- Not Captain. 

204
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,830 
I help you, Spock. 
You wrote the report lost my ship. 

205
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,280 
Commander, you should tell 
I filed a report. 

206
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:37,870 
I know you are very 
comply with the rules. 
But I can not. 

207
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,250 
Where I come from, you do not 
stabbing people who help you. 

208
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600 
Vulcan man could not lie. 

209
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,940 
So I talk 
to your human side. 

210
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,150 
You know why 
I returned utukmu? 

211
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,530 
Commander Spock? 
Frank Abbott U.S.S. 

212
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,180 
You're coming with me. 

213
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,010 
Yes, Captain. 

214
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,740 
To be honest, I miss you. 

215
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,100 
Thank you for coming. 

216
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,520 
Please sit down. 

217
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,280 
Some of you 
've heard about London. 

218
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,780 
The goal is a central archive Starfleet, 

219
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,820 
So ... who is now a hole 
which killed 42 men and women. 

220
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,340 
An hour ago, I received a message 
from Starfleet Officer ... 

221
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,040 
Recognize ... that the attack and 
says that he was forced by the ... 

222
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:46,070 
Commander ... John Harrison. 
He's one of us. 

223
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,180 
He's the man in charge 
for this attack. 

224
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:54,000 
Somehow, John Harrison 
declare war with Starfleet. 

225
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,950 
We must not let this 
escape from the Federation area. 

226
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,650 
You present here represent 
Commander of the entire region. 

227
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,380 
For the sake of those who died 
you have to catch this person. 

228
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,070 
This hunt, that's all 
that need to be spoken of. 

229
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:19,310 
<i> We did not detect a warp characteristics, 
so we're sure he's not far away. </ i> 

230
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,800 
You position the ship <i> 
blockade in formation ... </ i> 

231
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,360 
<i> ... then muster the vehicle search. </ i> 

232
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,860 
This man <i> killing innocent people. </ i> 

233
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:35,380 
<i> If met this guy and he was afraid 
will to fight ... </ i> 

234
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,040 
<i> ... you may use 
violence. </ i> 

235
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,570 
- What's in the bag? 
- Jim, not now. 

236
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,230 
Is not it strange attack the data center? 
It was more like a library. 

237
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,510 
Chris, what's the problem there? 

238
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:53,000 
Yes, sir. 
Tn. 
Kirk is being 
adapt as the main officer. 

239
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:55,750 
Speak up if you want to talk, Kirk. 
Tomorrow is too late. 

240
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,050 
Never mind, sir. 
Sorry. 

241
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,380 
Say it. 
Do not be shy. 

242
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,330 
Why data center? 

243
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:10,350 
Opera's entire public record. 
If he wanted to destroy Starfleet ... 

244
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,000 
This is just the beginning ... maybe. 

245
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,510 
The beginning of what, Tn. 
Kirk? 

246
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,060 
In the event of an attack, 
procedure requires ... 

247
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,410 
Senior command collects ... 
The Captain 

248
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:23,560 
Officer and President at Starfleet Headquarters ... 

249
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,850 
... In this room. 

250
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,590 
Surprisingly Harrison <i> up 
small vessels without warp speed - </ i> 

251
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,830 
Clear the room! 

252
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,070 
We need air defense squads! 
Daystrom Conference Room! 

253
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,090 
Come on, quickly! 

254
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,040 
<i> Shoot! </ i> 

255
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:18,630 
<i> Commander. 
Scott found 
something in the wreckage of the ship Harrison. </ i> 

256
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,110 
<i> He wanted to meet us. </ i> 

257
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:27,320 
Captain! 
I found it in the rubble 
ship. 
In this way he escaped. 

258
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,860 
- What do you mean? 
- This is a portable transfer device. 

259
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,590 
Able to track where it goes? 

260
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,930 
Already, sir, 
and you will not like it. 

261
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,060 
He went to the place ... 

262
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,780 
I can not ... we are headed. 

263
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,310 
Admiral, he was not on Earth. 

264
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,780 
He was at Kronos, sir. 

265
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,730 
I ask again be captain 
and permission to pursue. 

266
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,080 
Give us time. 

267
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,870 
- Kronos? 
- Yes, sir. 

268
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:01,180 
Harrison to the Klingon world. 
He defected? 

269
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,360 
We're not sure, sir. 

270
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,660 
He Ketha Province, 
uninhabited areas. 

271
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,840 
He must have hidden in there, sir! 

272
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,750 
He knows if we get there, 
will be war. 

273
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,760 
Starfleet could not mengerjarnya, 
but I could. 

274
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,070 
Please, sir. 

275
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:20,360 
Inevitable war with the Klingons. 
It has already begun. 

276
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,350 
Since we know about them, 
Klingon Empire conquered ... 

277
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:27,020 
Two planets ... which we know and 
we ship fired six times. 

278
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,700 
They want to attack us. 

279
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,340 
London is not the center of the explosion in the archive. 

280
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:39,330 
It was a secret branch of Starfleet 
called Section 31. 

281
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,930 
They developed technology 
defense and officer training ... 

282
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:46,840 
To gather information ... 
about Klingon and other enemies. 

283
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,090 
Harrison one of our best agents. 

284
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,250 
Now he is a fugitive 
and I wanted to kill him. 

285
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,000 
Pike always says 
you're the best and the brightest. 

286
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,230 
You should hear 
when he defended you. 

287
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,860 
She persuade 
joined Starfleet, right? 

288
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:03,890 
Yes, sir. 

289
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:06,680 
He says who 
who persuaded him? 

290
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,640 
He died because of me. 

291
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,100 
I do not want you to die because of me. 

292
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,520 
Spock, you say where Harrison 
hidden uninhabited? 

293
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,640 
Correct, sir. 

294
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:29,240 
As part of our defense, 31 
create a new photon torpedo. 

295
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,200 
Remote and untraceable - 
invisible Klingon sensor. 

296
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,980 
I do not want you to get hurt, 
but I want you to kill him. 

297
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:42,080 
Parking at the edge of the Neutral Zone, 
Harrison key position ... 

298
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:44,460 
... Shoot, kill him and go. 

299
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:48,550 
Mr. commissioned ask permission. 
Spock 
My Preferred officer returned so. 

300
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:51,510 
Given. 

301
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,480 
- Where are you? 
- For what? 

302
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,280 
Your medical tests. 
10 hours ago 
you exchanged gunfire. 

303
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,890 
I'm fine, Bones. 

304
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,930 
Of course not. 

305
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,010 
I'm fine. 

306
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,610 
Status report, Mr., Spock. 

307
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,710 
Enterprise will be ready to go 
when we arrived. 

308
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,130 
Good. 

309
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,380 
Captain. 

310
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:30,940 
Thank you 
sent me back. 

311
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,370 
Sam-same. 

312
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:38,250 
Because I Main officer again, 
I object to our mission. 

313
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,000 
Of course. 

314
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,030 
Starfleet regulations prohibit 
executing people without trial ... 

315
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,310 
Something that you and your ... 
Admiral Marcus forgotten. 

316
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:49,930 
Firing torpedoes 
Klingon breaking into the world - 

317
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,420 
Area was uninhabited. 
There will be only one victim. 

318
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,810 
And we do not regard order 
by Starfleet regulations. 

319
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,900 
We fired a torpedo into Klingon? 

320
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,310 
In addition to the regulations, 
This action immoral. 

321
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:05,640 
Help you from the volcano is 
immoral and I do not get nothing. 

322
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,580 
Calm down. 

323
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,210 
I do not accept 
ethical lessons of the robot! 

324
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:11,420 
Ridicule it shows that 
and you were right all defensive. 

325
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:15,280 
I do not ask for your opinion. 
Bones, get that thing out of my face. 

326
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,420 
We could start a war mission 
and this is immoral. 

327
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,330 
Maybe you need time to 
arrive at this conclusion. 

328
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,180 
Captain Kirk. 

329
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,410 
Scientific Officer Wallace. 
I was assigned 
in Enterprise by Admiral Marcus. 

330
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,440 
This command pemindahanku. 

331
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,210 
You ask for additional scientific officer? 

332
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,380 
I hope yes. 

333
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,840 
"Lieutenant Carol Wallace." 

334
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:44,800 
"Can a doctorate in physics 
specialized in advanced weapons. " 

335
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,040 
Amazing achievement. 

336
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,150 
Thank you. 

337
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,130 
But no need for 
I'm back. 

338
00:34:49,130 ​​--> 00:34:50,470 
The more increasingly crowded. 

339
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:51,910 
Sitting, Doctor. 

340
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,650 
The crew, 
be prepared for launch. 

341
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:23,490 
I will not sign anything! 
Get rid of this thing from my boat! 

342
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,350 
- There is a problem, Tn. 
Scott? 

343
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:30,820 
I told him there should be no weapons 
on this ship if I did not know what was in it. 

344
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,270 
- Mr. 
Scott has a point - 
- Report to the bridge. 

345
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:34,540 

346
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,890 
Scott I know you mean 
but we need this torpedo. 

347
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,080 
Pak, photon torpedoes 
using fuel. 

348
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,070 
I could not detect this type of 
fuel because it is protected. 

349
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,710 
I ask for specifics, 
but he says - 

350
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,850 
Confidential. 

351
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:53,170 
I said, "There is no specification, 
no signature! " 

352
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:53,730 

353
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,350 
Completed flight preparation. 
We're ready to go. 

354
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:57,660 
Thank you, Mr.. 
Sulu. 

355
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,290 
Excuse me, sir, 
I have to prepare the warp core. 

356
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,140 
Dropped. 

357
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,390 
Vitalmu above normal. 

358
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,860 
Report to the medical room. 
Scotty! 

359
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,680 
Approve the weapons. 

360
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,730 
- You know what this is? 
- I do not have time to talk. 

361
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:15,070 
- That's warp core. 

362
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,700 
This radioactive disaster 
waiting to happen. 

363
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,300 
Slight changes in the magnetic power of 

364
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,960 
fired one 
6 or more dozen torpedo ... 

365
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,010 
Without knowing its contents ... ... 

366
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:27,420 
Can trigger a chain reaction ... 
that could kill the whole ship. 

367
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:30,480 
Leaving this in the Enterprise 
disappointment is the last! 

368
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,000 
- What a disappointment the first? 
- Any - 

369
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:36,740 
There is a lot of disappointment - Starfleet 
mine seized transwarp equation. 

370
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:39,480 
Now there are crazy people use it 
across the galaxy! 

371
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,590 
From where it can be? 

372
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,730 
We have to follow orders, Scotty! 

373
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,280 
That's what scares me. 

374
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,490 
Obviously this is a military operation. 

375
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:49,840 
Is that what we are now? 
I thought we were explorers. 

376
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,840 
Sign the torpedoes - it commands. 

377
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,210 
You leave me no choice 
but to resign. 

378
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,510 
Come on, Scotty. 

379
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:01,510 
- You leave me no choice, sir. 
- You did not give me much - 

380
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,290 
You accept resignation 
me or not? 

381
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,130 
I accept! 

382
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,320 
I accept. 

383
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,850 
You're relieved, Tn. 
Scott. 

384
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,590 
Jim ... 

385
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:33,190 
... For God's sake, 
do not use the torpedo. 

386
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,990 
I'm sorry 
about Admiral Pike. 

387
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,030 
We are all well. 

388
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,460 
- Are you okay? 
- Well, thank you, Lieutenant. 

389
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,550 
Actually, Scotty has just stopped. 

390
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,770 
And your girlfriend is always doubt me. 

391
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,010 
Sorry, it does not deserve. 

392
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,300 
Sometimes wish I pulled her bangs. 

393
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,470 
Maybe because I 

394
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,070 
Not your fault. 

395
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,350 
Is not it? 

396
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:34,040 
- Wait, you guys fight? 
- I do not want to talk about - 

397
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,790 
What's it like? 

398
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,840 
Hot ears? 

399
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,620 
Captain on the bridge! 

400
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:50,030 
- Mr.
Chekov. 
You're close to Scott. 

401
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,310 
- Do you know about the engine system? 
- Yes, sir. 

402
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:53,970 
Good. 

403
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,980 
You're my new Chief Technical Officer. 
Wear red shirts. 

404
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,540 
Yes, Captain. 

405
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,900 
Pull all fastening, Tn. 
Sulu. 

406
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:10,640 
Yes, sir. 

407
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,570 
A deck clamp, 
two and three released. 

408
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,470 
All fastening withdrawn. 

409
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,510 
- Lieutenant Uhura. 
Open communication channels ship. 

410
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,430 
Tn. 
Chekov how it is? 

411
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:37,400 
- All systems normal, Captain. 
- Received. 

412
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,020 
Warp speed waiting for your command. 

413
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,040 
Thank you Mr.. 
Chekov. 

414
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,710 
- Come on. 

415
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,560 
Channel is open, sir. 

416
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,540 
Attention, crew, Enterprise. 

417
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:06,700 
As you know, Christopher Pike, 
former captain and our friends ... 

418
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,150 
... Has died. 

419
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,570 
The killer hiding 
Klingon world ... 

420
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,460 
and he was sure we would get there. 

421
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,900 
We're heading there. 

422
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:24,260 
Admiral Marcus asked 
that our presence is unknown. 

423
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,230 
Tension between the Federation 
and high Klingon. 

424
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,490 
Anything can trigger 
lead to war. 

425
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,360 
Will kupimpin group of people 
to the empty city in Kronos surface ... 

426
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,250 
Where we will capture ... 
fugitive John Harrison ... 

427
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:56,350 
And bring it to Earth ... 
to stand trial for his actions. 

428
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:03,230 
Let's go get him. 
Kirk finished. 

429
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,430 
Captain, correct decision. 

430
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,800 
I would love 
if you can participate. 

431
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:18,540 
You? 
Happy? 

432
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,400 
I used to language 
convey an idea. 

433
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,690 
Thank you, Mr.. 
Spock. 

434
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,560 
Spock. 
You surprise me. 

435
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,020 
What are you doing, Doctor? 

436
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,420 
- Check the torpedoes - 
- You're wrong. 

437
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:56,990 
What are you doing on this ship? 
There was no 
note you assigned to the Enterprise. 

438
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,760 
It was definitely one. 

439
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,800 
I think so too, Dr. 
Marcus. 

440
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:04,290 
Unless you're lying 
about identity. 

441
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:09,460 
Wallace is your mother's name. 
Admiral guess is your father. 

442
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:14,020 

443
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:17,600 
I know I have no right 
ask you this. 

444
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,990 
But please. 
he must not know I'm here - 

445
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:30,760 
Technicians cut warp speed. 

446
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,640 
Chekov, you ruined my ship? 

447
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,170 
I do not know what happened. 
Warp core overheating. 

448
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,020 
Kuaktifkan forced emergency stop. 
Definitely coolant leaks. 

449
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,880 
- Sorry Captain. 
- Damn. 

450
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,440 
Sulu, when arriving at the destination. 

451
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,460 
20 minutes in the enemy 
which we did not take into account. 

452
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,990 
- Come on hurry, Where Spock? 
- Here the captain. 

453
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,460 
You come with me to the Kronos. 

454
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,900 
Lieutenant, how your Klingon language? 

455
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,110 
Less trained, but good. 

456
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:56,280 
Good, you're coming too. 

457
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,320 
Will there be a problem 
if you guys work together? 

458
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,930 
Of course not. 

459
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:05,020 
Not clear. 

460
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:07,390 
I'll meet you in the space ship. 

461
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,630 
You're not going down, right? 

462
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:13,630 
You do not rob a bank if 
your escape car tire leak. 

463
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,640 
Technicians will be completed 
fix it when we get back. 

464
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,720 
True, Tn. 
Chekov? 

465
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,450 

466
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,220 
I tried my best. 

467
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,740 
Sulu you control. 

468
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:31,230 
So off we went, send 
signal is directed to the location of Harrison 

469
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:34,000 
Said that he was shot with a torpedo. 

470
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,630 
and if he did not think 
You will use 

471
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:38,990 
- That's the problem? 
- No, sir. 

472
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,770 
I just was never a leader. 

473
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,040 
You'll be fine. 

474
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,150 
Jim! 
Wait! 

475
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:49,150 
You tell him to play high stakes poker 

476
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,040 
without a good card 
and told him to bluff. 

477
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,610 
Sulu has the potential, 
but he can not be a captain. 

478
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,540 
During the 2 hours following his captain. 
Quite figurative, it commands. 

479
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,970 
Make sure the ship K'Normian 
ready to fly. 

480
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,850 
While Captain Sulu 
the Space Ship 2. 

481
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,910 
Fill fuel merchant ships 
we seized when the incident Mudd. 

482
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,650 
Captain Kirk headed toward you. 

483
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:23,840 
Leave prepared separately, Captain. 

484
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,740 
Lieutenant, remove the red shirts. 

485
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,980 
You are the arms dealer 
K'Normian. 
Wear it. 

486
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,000 
If this mission fails. 
Starfleet would not be involved. 

487
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,350 
Unless you want to start a war, 
Hendroff. 

488
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,510 
- No, sir. 

489
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,720 
Good. 
AKu too. 

490
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:58,110 
I detect a hint of life 
Ketha Province. 

491
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:02,660 
According to information from Tn. 
Scott, 
This possibility is John Harrison. 

492
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,480 
Sulu, we found it. 
Tell him that you're serious. 

493
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,670 
Attention, John Harrison. 

494
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,780 
This Captain Hikaru Sulu 
of U.S.S. 
Enterprise. 

495
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,920 
A vessel contains a trained officer 
heading toward you. 

496
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:21,520 
If you do not give up 
to them ... 

497
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,860 
will kutembakkan 
all torpedoes remotely ... 

498
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:28,300 
Your location ... the lock. 

499
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,220 
You have 2 minutes 
to surrender. 

500
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,980 
If you reject it destroyed. 

501
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,270 
If you're testing me ... 
you will fail. 

502
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:45,450 
Sulu ... 

503
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:48,550 
Remind me ... 
do not make you angry. 

504
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:53,570 
PLANET KRONOS 

505
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:56,170 
We will arrive at the location of Harrison 
3 minutes longer. 

506
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:58,400 
He would not go away. 

507
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,310 
Possibility he tried 
we kill is 91.6 percent. 

508
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,440 
Terrific. 

509
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,620 
Good thing you're not afraid to die. 

510
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:09,980 
- I do not hear your words. 
- I did not say anything. 

511
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,800 
I will speak if you listen. 

512
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,530 
- I'd rather talk alone. 
- You'd rather not talk about it. 

513
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:20,660 
You will fight now? 

514
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:24,080 
Attention was never on - 
Sorry, Captain, briefly. 

515
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:27,070 
- Us. 
On the volcano, 
You do not think of us. 

516
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,610 
What impacts me 
if you die, Spock. 

517
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:32,590 
You do not feel anything. 

518
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:38,300 
You do not care. 
Not just me 
that upset you. 
The captain also. 

519
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:40,200 
No. 
Do not involve me. 

520
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:43,460 
He's right. 

521
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,300 
You mean lack pedulianku 
of death was wrong. 

522
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:51,150 
Everyone wants to 
live long and prosper. 

523
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:51,940 
Great, 

524
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,470 
That's not a song of love, Spock. 

525
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:54,720 
You misunderstand. 

526
00:46:56,610 --> 00:47:00,990 
I did not want to 
feel anything before I die. 

527
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:05,510 
When Admiral Pike dying, 
I joined his consciousness ... 

528
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:09,260 
.. And feel that he felt 
when he died. 

529
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,820 
Anger. 
Confusion. 

530
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:13,740 
Lonely. 

531
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,190 
Fear. 

532
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:19,450 
I never felt 
The previous ... 

533
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,880 
Many times ... 
when the planet was destroyed. 

534
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:29,580 
I chose 
to not feel that way anymore. 

535
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,750 
Nyota, you're mistaken 
my choice not to feel ... 

536
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:39,100 
As a form of ... ketidakpedulianku. 

537
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,070 
I assure you, the truth 
the opposite of that. 

538
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,180 
What is it? 

539
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,330 
Where's the signal? 

540
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:55,120 
Disconnected. 
I tried to return it. 

541
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:01,780 
<i> We chased ship classes Klingon D-4. </ i> 

542
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,100 
- I thought it was vacated sector. 
- Must be a random patrol. 

543
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,040 
Hold on! 

544
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,590 
This ship is not 
have the ability to attack. 

545
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:12,670 
The ship got us. 
Give me the entire fuel cell. 

546
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:28,370 
Damn! 

547
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,220 
They came - towards 285! 

548
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,430 
It! 
We can get away there. 

549
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,950 
If you mean the space between 
building it, this ship will not fit. 

550
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:44,510 
- Must be fit. 
- Captain, will not fit. 

551
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,240 
Definitely fit! 

552
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:07,140 
- I told you for sure fit. 
- I doubt it count. 

553
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,450 
- Any sign of them? 
- No, it worries me. 

554
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,340 
- We passed! 
- Or they ruin our scanner. 

555
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,350 
Or we escaped. 

556
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,140 
They ordered 
we landed. 

557
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,450 
Captain, they will ask 
why we are here. 

558
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:42,270 
They will torture us. 

559
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:43,880 
We asked. 

560
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:45,830 
And kill us. 

561
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:50,230 
We go out and shoot. 

562
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:55,780 
We're outnumbered, lost weapons. 

563
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:58,940 
Unlikely survivor 
if we strike first. 

564
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,150 
You brought me here 
because I speak Klingon. 

565
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,980 
Let me speak Klingon. 

566
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:56,250 
It's not gonna work. 

567
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:58,480 
It's our only chance. 

568
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:01,710 
If you cut it not only 
you make angry Klingon ... 

569
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:03,650 
But also make ... 
Lieutenant Uhura angry. 

570
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,070 
I'm here to help you. 

571
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:37,550 
- Lieutenant. 
- Thank you. 
Captain. 

572
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,070 
With respect. 

573
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:53,070 
There are criminals 
hiding in the ruins. 

574
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:56,130 
He killed a lot of our people. 

575
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:12,930 
Why should I care 
people kill people? 

576
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,890 
Because you care about honor. 

577
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:20,650 
This man has no honor. 

578
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:24,300 
You and your men 
in danger. 

579
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:45,280 
- Lower the weapon. 
- How many torpedoes? 

580
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:49,890 
Torpedo that you use 
to threaten me. 

581
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:50,840 
How much? 

582
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,440 
72. 

583
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,600 
I give up. 

584
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:21,280 
On behalf of Christopher Pike ... 

585
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,000 
My friend ... ... 

586
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,100 
I accept the submission ... you. 

587
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:50,770 
Captain! 

588
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:01,270 

589
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:14,080 
Cuff him. 

590
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,780 
- Bones, meet me in the cell. 
- Immediately. 

591
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:38,060 
Lieutenant. 

592
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,510 
Contact Starfleet and tell 
we have captured Harrison ... 

593
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:44,990 
And we will be back ... 
so fixed warp core. 

594
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,800 
<i> - Why did he give up? 
- I do not know. </ I> 

595
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:07,660 
He killed a bunch of Klingon 
alone. 
I want to know how. 

596
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,710 
There seems to be a super human being here. 

597
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,320 
You tell me. 

598
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:22,830 
Hands out of the hole. 
I want to take a blood sample. 

599
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:39,200 
Why do not we move, Captain? 

600
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:44,040 
Unexpected damage 
perhaps the warp core ... 

601
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,760 
Makes you stranded ... 
on the edge of Klingon territory? 

602
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:49,400 
- How do you know? 
- Bones. 

603
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:53,150 
You will assess 
wawasanku useful, Captain. 

604
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,690 
Already? 

605
00:57:58,010 --> 00:57:59,080 
Let me know the results. 

606
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:04,040 
Ignore me, then everyone 
on this ship will die. 

607
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:13,380 
Captain, he just wanted to fool. 

608
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:16,030 
Better not 
talk to him again. 

609
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:17,200 
Give me some time. 

610
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:32,140 
Let me explain the situation. 

611
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,760 
You're a criminal. 

612
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:37,680 
I see you kill people 
innocent. 

613
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:39,800 
I was given permission to kill you. 

614
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:45,430 
You're alive because I let. 

615
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,200 
Then shut up. 

616
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:54,040 
You're going to hit me again and again 
until limp hand? 

617
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:56,270 
Obviously you want, 
so tell me ... 

618
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,550 
Why did you let me live? 

619
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,290 
We've all done wrong. 

620
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:04,250 
I give up 
to you because ... 

621
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:09,040 
... You have a conscience, even if you 
trying to convince me otherwise. 

622
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:14,690 
If not, no way I could 
convince yourself of the truth. 

623
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:21,250 
23 ... 17 ... 46 ... 11 

624
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:23,920 
Coordinates not far from the Earth. 

625
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:29,370 
If you want to know why 
I did all of that, take a look there. 

626
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:32,340 
Give me one reason 
why should I listen to you. 

627
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:34,150 
I could give you 72 reasons. 

628
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:37,210 
And everything is on your ship, Captain. 

629
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:40,840 
Since from the beginning. 

630
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,950 
I suggest you open one. 

631
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:11,430 
You know what bothers 
torpedo about it? 

632
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:15,280 
Modification, improvement. 

633
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,860 
Then suddenly I stopped. 
Just for doing right. 

634
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:22,490 
And what are you doing? 

635
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:24,340 
Stand alone as an oyster 
looked at me. 

636
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:26,160 
What? 

637
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:27,580 
Scotty, this is Kirk. 

638
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:28,560 
Oh, wow! 

639
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:32,540 
It turns out Captain James Tiberius 
Perfect hair! 

640
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:34,200 
<i> Did you hear? 
I call him the Perfect Hair. </ I> 

641
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,310 
<i> - Where are you? 
- Where are you? </ I> 

642
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,240 
Are you stoned? 

643
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:40,170 
None of my business what I want, Jim. 

644
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,320 
I need your help. 
Record these coordinates. 

645
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:46,490 

646
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:48,290 
You write it? 

647
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:50,110 
You think I'm 
can not remember four figures? 

648
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:54,280 
Trust me a little. 
What are the three numbers? 

649
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,160 
<i> ... 46 ... </ i> 

650
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:58,740 
I do not know what you're looking for ... 

651
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:02,020 
... But I think you'll know 
so you see it. 

652
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,350 
Maybe you're right about the torpedo. 

653
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:11,540 
I'll take that apology. 
And I consider it an apology. 

654
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:14,040 
You are asked to stop. 

655
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,250 
You made me stop! 

656
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,250 
Scott? 

657
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:18,650 
Scott. 

658
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,230 
Nerve of that guy! 

659
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:26,270 
I do not want to help him. 

660
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,170 
Not! 

661
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:30,380 
Alright! 

662
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,590 
Are you crazy? 

663
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:34,760 
Do not listen to this guy! 

664
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:36,810 
He killed Pike, 
he almost killed you ... 

665
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:40,460 
Now ... you want to open a torpedo 
because he dare. 

666
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:41,910 
Why did he help us, Bones? 

667
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:43,900 
He has a point, Captain. 

668
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:46,470 
Do not agree denganju, Spock. 
It makes me uncomfortable. 

669
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:51,200 
Control your emotions, Doctor. 
Logic said ... 

670
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:54,970 
Logic? 
People want to make us mad 
blow up our ship and - 

671
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:57,310 
Not that. 
Somehow 
he gave up, but not that. 

672
01:01:58,330 --> 01:02:00,380 
We will open the torpedo. 
The trick? 

673
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:06,060 
Without Tn. 
Scott, who can 
weighing 4 tons of dynamite to open? 

674
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,790 
Admiral's daughter is a weapons expert. 

675
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:11,420 
Maybe he could. 

676
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:13,540 
Admiral's daughter what? 

677
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:18,200 
Carol Marcus. 
Your new scientific officer 
cover his identity in order to participate. 

678
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:20,210 
When you want to say it? 

679
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:22,350 
When needed. 
Like I just did. 

680
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:26,530 
- Torpedoes in armory? 
- Ready fired. 
Actually it's what? 

681
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:29,530 
I do not know. 
Kupalsukan pemindahanku 
to your ship to reveal - 

682
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,050 
Sorry about that. 

683
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:35,260 
If I create a problem, 
I'm sorry. 
I'm Carol Marcus. 

684
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:36,260 
James Kirk. 

685
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,120 
Torpedoes. 

686
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:41,040 
My father gave 
access to the entire program, 

687
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:43,840 
Then I heard ... he makes this torpedo. 

688
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:46,900 
When I menyanyakan this case, 
he did not want to see me. 

689
01:02:47,950 --> 01:02:51,270 
And I found missing torpedoes 
of all official records. 

690
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:53,470 
Then he gave it to me. 

691
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:56,470 
You're smarter 
of reputation, Captain Kirk. 

692
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,230 
I have a reputation? 

693
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:00,310 
Yes. 
I friend Christine Chapel. 

694
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:03,000 
Christine. 
What is she doing? 

695
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,280 
He moved to the outer limits 
to be a nurse. 
He's happier. 

696
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:07,190 
Good for you. 

697
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:09,720 
You do not know who 
I'm talking about, yes? 

698
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:11,750 
What are we doing here? 

699
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,550 
- The ship was ready to fly? 
- Of course. 

700
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:15,520 
- Turn around. 
- Why? 

701
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:17,760 
Rotate it. 

702
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:22,990 
Too dangerous 
open torpedo at Enterprise. 

703
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:27,490 
There is a small planet near here. 
I can open one there. 

704
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,240 
But I need help. 

705
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,290 
Turn around. 

706
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:33,660 
Now! 

707
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,600 
Captain on the bridge. 

708
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:41,530 
Sulu. 
Doctor Marcus and McCoy 
've landed on a small planet? 

709
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:44,190 
Yes, sir. 
They bring 
torpedo into position. 

710
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:46,380 
Good, No sign of a Klingon? 

711
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:50,020 
Yet. 
But if here any longer, 
they will find us. 

712
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:53,830 
Lieutenant Uhura, you tell Starfleet 
we catch Harrison? 

713
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:56,070 
there has been no answer. 

714
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:58,580 
Technicians to the bridge. 
Captain, do you hear? 

715
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:00,410 
Chekov, Give me the good news. 

716
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:05,110 
We found the leak, 
but severely damaged. 
We're working on. 

717
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:06,120 
<i> know what causes it? </ i> 

718
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:11,230 
No, sir. 
But I take full responsibility. 

719
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,920 
I guess this is not your fault. 
Work continues. 

720
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:17,950 
Ship was waiting, Captain. 

721
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:20,810 
Bones, thank you for your help. 

722
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:23,330 
Dr.. 
Marcus took 
most stable hands here. 

723
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:26,990 
When I'm stuck in the dream planet 
blank with a beautiful woman ... 

724
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:28,520 
Torpedoes ... no! 

725
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,240 
McCoy, 
you were not there to woo. 

726
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:33,990 
How this legendary hand 
can help you, Dr. 
Marcus? 

727
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:35,100 
Bones! 

728
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:40,070 
In order to know the power of this weapon, 
we need to open the warhead would be. 

729
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:43,550 
Unfortunately, this weapon is active warheads. 

730
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:47,050 
Unfortunately, I had an emergency cesarean section 
the Gorn are pregnant. 

731
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:50,160 
Twins 8, and they bite. 

732
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:53,030 
I think I can handle 
torpedomu well. 

733
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:57,790 
McCoy, There is a bundle of fiber optic cable 
in the frame. 

734
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,220 
Cut the cable to-23. 

735
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:02,420 
Do not touch the other. 
Understand? 

736
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:04,820 
It never occurred to me 

737
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:05,670 
McCoy ... 

738
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:09,450 
<i> ... wait for my mark. 
I changed 
Explosive route processor. </ i> 

739
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,900 
- Are you ready? 
- It is. 

740
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:12,710 
Good luck. 

741
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:17,590 
- Torpedo active by itself. 
- Will explode in 30 seconds, sir! 

742
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:20,240 
What happened? 
My hands can not get out! 

743
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,370 
Move them now. 

744
01:05:22,430 --> 01:05:23,640 
Shifters can not distinguish 

745
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:27,720 
Dr. ... between. 
McCoy and torpedoes. 
We can not move one of them. 

746
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:29,930 
- Can you disarmed? 
- I'm trying. 

747
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:31,060 
I'm trying. 

748
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:33,360 
Jim, get him out! 

749
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,200 
Do not! 
If you move me, he's dead! 

750
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,470 
<i> Let me do! </ i> 

751

753
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:42,140 
Ready to move Dr. 
Marcus

754
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:44,540 
4 ..., 3 ... 

755
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:45,660 

756
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:52,600 
Successful disarmament, Captain. 

757
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:56,410 
McCoy, are you okay? 

758
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:02,550 

759
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:04,840 
Jim? 

760
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,210 
You definitely want to see this. 

761
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:20,940 
COORDINATES 23.17.46.11

Gosh. 

767
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,180 
How? 

768
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:49,480 
Clever. 
Place fuel revoked ... 

769
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:51,770 
And tuned to hide ... 
The cryogenic body. 

770
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,780 
- He's still alive? 
- Yes. 

771
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:57,760 
But if we try to revive him ... 

772
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:02,100 
... Without the right order, he could die. 
This technology is beyond my knowledge. 

773
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:03,880 
How sophisticated. 
Doctor? 

774
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,670 
Not advanced. 
Cryo capsule was ancient. 

775
01:08:07,310 --> 01:08:08,830 
We do not freeze people since ...

Warp ... development ... 

777
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:13,100

about our friend.

01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:26,680 
Why would anyone in the torpedo? 

780
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:31,360 
There are men and women 
throughout torpedo, Captain. 

781
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,640 
I put it there. 

782
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,000 
Who are you? 

783
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:43,050 
Remnants of the past. 

784
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,390 
Designed to be 
super to be able to ... 

785
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:49,810 
led peace 
The world is at war. 

786
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:55,510 
However, we are considered criminals, 
exiled. 

787
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:58,700 
For centuries we slept. 

788
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:03,700 
Hope when we wake up ..., 
circumstances are different. 

789
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,350 
After the destruction of Vulcan. 

790
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:09,910 
Starfleet-mu ... start exploring 
farthest space. 

791
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:13,130 
Found floating my boat. 
I just generated. 

792
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:16,420 
I checked "John Harrison" 
Before a year ago, he was not there. 

793
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:19,910 
John Harrison is just fiction 
created when I wake up ... 

794
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:22,720 
Admiral ... by Marcus 
to help achieve the goal. 

795
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,490 
Hoax to cover 
actual identity. 

796
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:31,520 
My name is Khan. 

797
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,330 
Why would a Starfleet admiral ... 

798
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:43,010 
To ask for help ... 
300-year-old frozen human? 

799
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:45,890 
Because I'm better. 

800
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:47,960 
- In what way? 
- Everything. 

801
01:09:50,150 --> 01:09:52,950 
Marcus needs to respond to threats 
uncivilized in the civilized ... 

802
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:57,700 
... And for that he needs thought 
a soldier. 
Mind. 

803
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,410 
To design a weapon 
and warships. 

804
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:02,130 
You mean Admiral ... 

805
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:06,530 
Breaking the rules ... 
to utilize knowledge. 

806
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:08,420 
He wanted to take advantage of kekejamanku. 

807
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:12,060 
Cleverness is not enough 
in war, Tn.
Spock. 

808
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:16,400 
Just breaking the rules you can not, 
what else break a bone? 

809
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,320 
Marcus makes use 
to design weapons. 

810
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:22,970 
To realize the 
Starfleet military will their dreams. 

811
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,470 
He sent you to 
use these weapons. 

812
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:29,800 
Firing torpedoku 
to the unsuspecting planet. 

813
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:33,650 
Then he deliberately 
cripple your ship ... 

814
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:37,530 
... In enemy territory, 
lead to a definite result. 

815
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:40,100 
Klingon will seek 
whoever the perpetrators ... 

816
01:10:40,330 --> 01:10:42,950 
... And you can not escape. 

817
01:10:43,450 --> 01:10:47,870 
So Marcus will get 
war he was talking about. 

818
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:49,860 
The war that she always wanted. 

819
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:50,950 
No. 

820
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,210 
I saw shooting 
room full of Starfleet officers. 

821
01:10:57,590 --> 01:10:59,140 
You killed them in cold blood! 

822
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:01,720 
Marcus grabbed my crew. 

823
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:02,890 
You're a killer! 

824
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:06,160 
He used my friends 
to control me. 

825
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:13,540 
I tried to smuggle 
them to a safe place ... 

826
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:16,030 
To hide their ... 
kurancang in arms ... 

827
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:20,010 
... But I got caught. 

828
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:25,740 
I had no choice but to 
blurred alone. 

829
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:31,170 
When I did, 
I have reason to suspect ... 

830
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:35,250 
That Marcus ... 
had killed all ... 

831
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:38,600 
I care ... people. 

832
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:45,350 
So I acted the same. 

833
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:50,990 
My crew. 

834
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:53,990 
Kirk ... is my family. 

835
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:58,090 
Are not you going to do 
anything for your family? 

836
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:03,310 
Warning <i> sir! 
A ship 
warp speed toward us. </ i> 

837
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:05,170 
- Klingon? 
- At warp speed? 

838
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:08,640 
No, Kirk. 
We know that's who. 

839
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,630 
I guess not. 
At him instead of Kronos. 

840
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:19,360 
Lieutenant, Khan Bring to the medical room. 
6 Ask the security guard. 

841
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:21,500 
<i> Captain on the bridge! </ i> 

842
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:24,390 
Estimated ship time arrives. 

843
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:25,440 
Three seconds Pak. 

844
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,980 
- Shield. 
- Yes, Captain. 

845
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:55,220 
They contacted us, sir. 

846
01:12:56,230 --> 01:12:57,180 
Show. 

847
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:00,370 
Broadcast to all ships, 
for proof. 

848
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:05,940 
Captain Kirk. 

849
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:09,950 
Admiral Marcus. 
I do not expect you to come. 

850
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:12,840 
Awesome your ship. 

851
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:16,270 
I do not suspect 
you catch Harrison. 

852
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:17,700 
and violating orders. 

853
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:20,030 
We ... 

854
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:24,140 
Had to improvise when ... 
we suddenly broken warp core. 

855
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:25,970 
But you knew that, right? 

856
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:27,900 
I do not see what you mean. 

857
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:31,000 
That's why you are here, right? 
Improvements help us? 

858
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:36,470 
Why else the head of Starfleet 
come to the edge of the Neutral Zone? 

859
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:39,190 
They scan our ship. 

860
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:41,000 
Quest can I help, sir? 

861
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:43,800 
Where the prisoner, Kirk? 

862
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:49,510 
According to the rules of Starfleet, I'll bring 
Khan to Earth for trial. 

863
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:52,360 
Shit. 

864
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,630 
You talk to him. 

865
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:58,500 
That's who wanted to avoid. 

866
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:03,870 
I took the risk and wake, 
think of high intelligence ... 

867
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:07,060 
can protect us 
from the next attack. 

868
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,190 
But I was wrong. 

869
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:13,390 
Now the blood of all those who 
he was killed there in my hand. 

870
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:15,870 
So I ask you ... 

871
01:14:16,830 --> 01:14:18,130 
He ... gave me. 

872
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:20,910 
I ended the order to which I start. 

873
01:14:24,990 --> 01:14:27,970 
Then what to do with 
the rest of the crew, sir? 

874
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:34,940 
Shoot them into Klingon? 
End 
72 soul? 
All start a war? 

875
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,570 
He is put 
the people in the torpedo. 

876
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:41,550 
<i> I do not want you to know it 
so you're not burdened. </ i> 

877
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,570 
<i> You saw his ability. </ i> 

878
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:46,690 
Can you imagine if <i> 
we wake up crew? </ i> 

879
01:14:48,930 --> 01:14:50,900 
She said what? 
That he keep the peace? 

880
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,940 
He's a fool, son, 
You do not see it? 

881
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:57,780 
Khan and his crew put to death 
as a war criminal. 

882
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:02,300 
Tasks that we carry out punishment 
before the death of another person because of her. 

883
01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:07,070 
I ask again! 

884
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:10,640 
This last one, son. 

885
01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:14,020 
<i> Lower your shield. </ i> 

886
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:16,120 
<i> Tell him that. </ i> 

887
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:20,860 
He's in the engine room, sir. 

888
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:26,280 
But I will ask that 
He was taken to the transfer chamber. 

889
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:27,970 
I'll take it from here. 

890
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:31,210 
Do not lower the shield, Tn. 
Sulu. 

891
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:35,730 
Khan was given the medical room, 
may I know what's the plan? 

892
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:37,820 
I said to Marcus 
we will bring 

893
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:40,130 
fugitive to Earth, it's what we do. 

894
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,250 
Tn. 
Chekov, use warp. 

895
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:47,050 
If you use the warp, 
we can destroy the core! 

896
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:48,130 
<i> Can we do? </ i> 

897
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:53,040 
Technically, yes. 
But would not advise it, Captain. 

898
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:54,100 
Understand. 

899
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:57,300 
Sulu, set the direction to Earth. 

900
01:15:57,610 --> 01:15:58,410 
Yes, sir. 

901
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:00,690 
Do it. 

902
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:10,410 
At least we are moving again. 

903
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,610 
If you think you're safe 
at warp speed, you're wrong. 

904
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:22,140 
Contact Starfleet. 

905
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:25,380 
Tell us chased into the Neutral Zone 
by the Federation ship was unmarked. 

906
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:26,410 
Communications dead. 

907
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:30,820 
- Ask permission to enter the pavilion. 
- Dr. 
Marcus. 

908
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:33,940 
He will follow and I just ... 

909
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:35,480 
Who can stop him ... 
destroy this plane. 

910
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:36,440 
Let me talk to him. 

911
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,280 
Carol, We warp speed. 
He can not catch up. 

912
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:41,150 
His ship has the ability to 
advanced warp - 

913
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:43,520 
Captain! 
I detect 
I do not understand something. 

914
01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:16,040 
- Where are we? 
- 237 000 kilometers from Earth. 

915
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,770 
- Reports of damage! 
- Weapons to die. 
We have no defense. 

916
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:19,110 
There was a leak in the wall. 

917
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:21,710 
- Where's the damage? 
- Damage to the body of the ship. 

918
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:29,400 
Movement away! 
Take us to the Earth! 

919
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:34,300 
Stop it! 
The whole ship is going to die 
if you do not let me talk to him. 

920
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:37,690 
Uhura, contact them. 

921
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:41,530 
Pak. 
This is me. 
This is Carol. 

922
01:17:51,070 --> 01:17:52,890 
What are you doing on that ship? 

923
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,010 
I hear your words. 

924
01:17:57,460 --> 01:18:00,300 
That you made a mistake 
and you try to fix it. 

925
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:02,950 
But, Dad ... 

926
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:09,970 
I do not believe ... 
people who raised me ... 

927
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:14,670 
Able to destroy the ship ... 
full of innocent people. 

928
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,140 
If I'm wrong about that ... 

929
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:19,840 
Then do it ... 
with me in it. 

930
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:25,430 
Of course not, Carol. 

931
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:32,100 
Signals can be intercepted pemindahnya? 

932
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:32,820 
No, sir. 

933
01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:40,740 
Captain Kirk, without permission and 
working with Harrison ... 

934
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:42,600 
You escape ... into enemy territory ... 

935
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,790 
So I was forced to ... 
hunt you down and destroy you. 

936
01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:48,550 
- Key with laser. 
- Hold on, sir! 

937
01:18:48,730 --> 01:18:49,530 
Hurry. 

938
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:52,220 
Shutter rear torpedo 
to the Enterprise bridge. 

939
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:54,540 
My crew just follow orders. 

940
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:59,290 
I was responsible for 
actions. 
It was my own fault. 

941
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:04,120 
I'll send you the location of Khan now 
I'm just forgive them. 

942
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,000 
Please, sir. 

943
01:19:15,490 --> 01:19:17,000 
I'll do whatever you want. 

944
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:20,210 
Let them live. 

945
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:24,500 
It was a great apology. 

946
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:29,080 
Just so you know, I never 
awakmu want to forgive. 

947
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:32,170 
Fired immediately - 

948
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:54,050 
Sorry. 

949
01:19:59,950 --> 01:20:02,930 
Someone in the engine room 
reset our system. 

950
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:05,120 
What do you mean? 
Who? 

951
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:06,790 
Their arms off. 

952
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:10,280 
<i> Enterprise! 
Can you hear me? </ I> 

953
01:20:10,910 --> 01:20:11,650 
Scotty! 

954
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:15,590 
Guess what 
I found behind Jupiter? 

955
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,010 
<i> - You're on board! 
- I slipped inside. </ I> 

956
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:21,930 
For betraying Admiral 
Starfleet, then I want to go. 

957
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,110 
Get me out! 

958
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:26,300 
You're a miracle maker. 
We are understaffed. 

959
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:27,500 
<i> Wait! </ i> 

960
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:29,660 
Lack of energy? 
What happened to the Enterprise? 

961
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,200 
I'll call. 

962
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:34,400 

963
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:37,880 
Spock. 
How do we ship? 

964
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:42,210 
Our options are limited - 
can not shoot or run away. 

965
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:46,820 
There is one option. 

966
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,660 
When Scotty connected, 
connect to me. 

967
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:50,440 

968
01:20:50,950 --> 01:20:51,930 
Spock, you're in control. 

969
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:57,540 
Captain, I do mind. 

970
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,000 
On what? 
I did not say anything. 

971
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:03,290 
Because the ship could not beat it 
from the outside, then we attack from the inside. 

972
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:05,250 
Because the arrival of many people 
will be detected ... 

973
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:07,700 
Then we need to bring ... 
crew as little as possible. 

974
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,340 
You will be able to fight, 
it took the personnel ... 

975
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:13,100 
Fighting and excelling ... 
knowledge of the ship. 

976
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:17,750 
You will work with Khan, 
people who should we kill. 

977
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:21,700 
Not working, use it 
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend." 

978
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:23,540 
Uttered by the prince ... 

979
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:25,830 
And betrayed ... 
beheaded by his subordinates. 

980
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:27,540 
it's still a good quote. 

981
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:29,990 
- I'm coming. 
- No, I need you on the bridge. 

982
01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:32,680 
Can not let 
you do this. 
Fungsiku is ... 

983
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,390 
Help you take ... 
the best decision ... 

984
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:38,010 
That ... you can not do at this time. 

985
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:38,840 
You're right! 

986
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:45,180 
I'd do not 
unreasonable and illogical. 
This hunch. 

987
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:50,820 
I do not know what to do. 

988
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:54,320 
I just know I can do. 

989
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,290 
Enterprise and its crew took 
leader who knows that he is working on. 

990
01:22:03,350 --> 01:22:04,380 
I'm not a guy. 

991
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:08,720 
You're the one, Spock. 

992
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:33,540 
Explain everything about the ship. 

993
01:22:34,130 --> 01:22:37,610 
Heavy weapons class. 
Size 2-fold, 
3-fold speed. 

994
01:22:37,610 --> 01:22:39,950 
Sophisticated weaponry. 
Designed for little crew. 

995
01:22:40,610 --> 01:22:43,240 
Unlike the Federation ship generally, 
This boat is made for war. 

996
01:22:44,570 --> 01:22:49,730 
I'll do whatever 
so you're punished for what you did. 

997
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:57,160 
But now I need your help. 

998
01:22:57,570 --> 01:22:58,830 
What a reward for me? 

999
01:23:00,770 --> 01:23:02,720 
You said you would do 
anything to awakmu. 

1000
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:07,190 
- I can guarantee their safety. 
- Captain. 

1001
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:12,100 
Ensure safety 
awakmu course you can not. 

1002
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:19,550 
Bones, what are you doing 
with the Tribble? 

1003
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:21,490 
Tribble's death. 

1004
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:25,600 
Kusuntikkan platelet Khan 
to the body's tissues. 

1005
01:23:26,630 --> 01:23:29,940 
I've never seen regenerating cells 
like this, and I want to know why. 

1006
01:23:35,990 --> 01:23:37,860 
You coming or not? 

1007
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,060 
You want to do what? 

1008
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:45,670 
We were there. 
Sulu bring the Enterprise to the position. 

1009
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:47,390 
<i> Into this ship? 
The trick? </ I> 

1010
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:50,010 
There is a cargo door, hangar 7, 
access ports 101A. 

1011
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,240 
Search for manual switching 
air to open the door. 

1012
01:23:52,410 --> 01:23:54,530 
<i> Are you crazy? 
Whoever you are. </ I> 

1013
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:56,820 
Listen to him - 
all will be fine. 

1014
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:58,470 
Will not. 

1015
01:23:58,770 --> 01:24:00,400 
You want me to open the door the air ... 

1016
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:02,940 
There ... I could freeze, 
die and explode! 

1017
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:06,530 
From our position, 
could think to contact the New Vulcan? 

1018
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:09,880 
- I'll try. 
- Thank you. 

1019
01:24:12,110 --> 01:24:14,190 
Sulu, how 
status of the other ship? 

1020
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:17,360 
Their system is still dead. 
I align our ships. 

1021
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:53,780 
Scotty, how are things there? 

1022
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,540 
<i> Captain, I wish I had better news. </ i> 

1023
01:24:56,950 --> 01:24:59,020 
They lock 
access to the onboard computer. 

1024
01:24:59,430 --> 01:25:00,470 
<i> weapons they will be ready in the ... </ i> 

1025
01:25:00,650 --> 01:25:01,590 
... Three minutes. 

1026
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:05,640 
I can not stop attacks 
Their next. 
Wait. 

1027
01:25:07,070 --> 01:25:08,760 
We focus on the garbage disposal 

1028
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:10,570 
access ports 101A 
on the other ship. 

1029
01:25:11,090 --> 01:25:12,330 
Captain, the ship is parallel. 

1030
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:13,360 
Accepted. 

1031
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:16,640 
- Scotty. 
- I was in the hangar. 
Give me some time. 

1032
01:25:21,410 --> 01:25:22,730 
I ran. 

1033
01:25:33,470 --> 01:25:38,100 
Wait, Captain. 
This door is very small. 

1034
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,470 
At least 4 square meters. 

1035
01:25:39,870 --> 01:25:44,090 
Like a running jump from the car, 
from the bridge, into a small glass. 

1036
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:45,550 
It's fine. 
I've done it. 

1037
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,380 
Vertical jump. 
We jump to ... 

1038
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:53,110 
Not important. 

1039
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,780 
- You find manual removal? 
- Shifters manual. 

1040
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:56,060 
Yet. 

1041
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:07,960 
Captain, there is a lot of debris 
between our ship. 

1042
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:09,340 
Spock, not now, 
Scotty, are you ready? 

1043
01:26:09,490 --> 01:26:13,280 
It's not easy! 
Give me two seconds! 

1044
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,700 
Tell me 
This will succeed. 

1045
01:26:25,110 --> 01:26:27,950 
I have no information or belief 
to do that, Doctor. 

1046
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:29,620 
Captain, wait. 

1047
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:31,400 
You're very entertaining. 

1048
01:26:32,970 --> 01:26:34,250 
Come on. 
Come on. 

1049
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,110 
<i> Good! 
I'm ready to open its doors. </ I> 

1050
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:38,560 
Are you ready? 

1051
01:26:39,310 --> 01:26:40,110 
You? 

1052
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:44,510 
Spock, pull the trigger. 

1053
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:47,410 
Yes, Captain. 

1054
01:26:53,290 --> 01:26:54,610 
Launched a series of activation on the ... 

1055
01:26:54,790 --> 01:26:55,220 
Three ... ... 

1056
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:56,990 
... Two ... 

1057
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:58,680 
... One. 

1058
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:11,960 
Pak, Kirk headed collisions at 432! 

1059
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:14,020 
Captain, there is debris on the front. 

1060
01:27:14,450 --> 01:27:15,090 

1061
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:20,530 
Jim, you're out of line. 

1062
01:27:20,530 --> 01:27:22,130 
I know! 
I can see. 

1063
01:27:32,470 --> 01:27:33,350 
Do not move. 

1064
01:27:36,210 --> 01:27:40,380 
Use your compass, Captain. 
You have to be exactly at 37 243 degrees. 

1065
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:42,280 
I tried again. 

1066
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:47,180 
Scotty, you're going to be ready 
the door, right? 

1067
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,020 
What are you doing here? 

1068
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:53,360 
Care regulator 
air doors. 
You're great. 

1069
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:54,890 
Scott, where are you?! 

1070
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:56,420 
Captain, she can not hear you. 

1071
01:27:56,420 --> 01:27:57,530 
I tried to get a 
signal back. 

1072
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,170 
- Damn. 
- Captain, what is it? 

1073
01:28:03,650 --> 01:28:06,020 
Hit my helmet. 
Scott managed to contact? 

1074
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:06,900 

1075
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:10,600 
Communicator functions. 
Somehow she did not answer. 

1076
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:13,070 
- What is it? 
- You're Starfleet or personal security? 

1077
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:15,000 
- Show the other hand. 
- It seems you personal security. 

1078
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:16,670 
Collision detected! 

1079
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,790 
Khan, use a movement away! 
Debris on the front. 

1080
01:28:18,790 --> 01:28:19,840 
I saw it. 

1081
01:28:26,730 --> 01:28:28,000 
Sulu, we lose the Khan? 

1082
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,600 
I do not know. 
I can not 
trace in the rubble. 

1083
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:32,900 
What Khan shot? 

1084
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:34,180 
We are trying to find. 

1085
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:38,330 
Captain, set the destination 
to 183 to 473 degrees. 

1086
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,480 
Tampilanku dead. 
I flew without direction. 

1087
01:28:52,650 --> 01:28:56,790 
Captain, without it, mathematically 
achieving a goal is impossible. 

1088
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:59,470 
Spock, if I go back, we need to 
talk about how you entertain. 

1089
01:28:59,790 --> 01:29:01,810 
Commander, he will not succeed. 

1090
01:29:07,230 --> 01:29:08,690 
Tampilanku still functioning. 

1091
01:29:09,370 --> 01:29:11,210 
Kirk, you're 200 feet in front of me ... 

1092
01:29:11,210 --> 01:29:14,020 
satuku o'clock. 
Move to the left 
some degree and follow me. 

1093
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:29,050 
Scotty, we're close. 
We need 
warm welcome. 
Did you hear? 

1094
01:29:29,810 --> 01:29:33,040 
If you hear us, Tn. 
Scotty, 
Open the door in 10 ... 

1095
01:29:33,370 --> 01:29:36,050 
Who is counting down? 

1096
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:37,370 
You heard wrong. 

1097
01:29:37,370 --> 01:29:38,210 
Seven ... ... 

1098
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:40,000 
- Scott, where are you?! 
- ... 6 ... 

1099
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,350 
1800 meters. 
1600 meters. 

1100
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:43,680 
- Where are you?! 
- ... Three ... 

1101
01:29:43,930 --> 01:29:45,120 
You hear, Scotty? 

1102
01:29:45,790 --> 01:29:46,880 
- Sorry for this. 
- What? 

1103
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:48,580 
- Open the door! 
- Open the door! 

1104
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:49,290 
Now! 

1105
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:12,110 
Welcome. 

1106
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:15,790 
Glad to see you, Scotty. 

1107
01:30:16,150 --> 01:30:17,170 
Who is it? 

1108
01:30:19,190 --> 01:30:20,780 
Khan, Scotty. 
Scotty, Khan. 

1109
01:30:21,110 --> 01:30:21,570 
Hello. 

1110
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:25,660 
They will know we are here. 
I know the best way to the bridge. 

1111
01:30:30,670 --> 01:30:31,700 
Locked to immobilize. 

1112
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:33,290 
They had not. 

1113
01:30:34,010 --> 01:30:35,090 
Try not to get shot. 

1114
01:30:38,740 --> 01:30:40,750 
Commander, 
I got the transmission on demand. 

1115
01:30:41,690 --> 01:30:43,220 

1116
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:44,870 

1117
01:30:51,110 --> 01:30:51,900 

1118
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:54,770 

1119
01:30:59,810 --> 01:31:00,330 
Admiral. 

1120
01:31:04,150 --> 01:31:04,900 
I'll take care of you nan - 

1121
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:10,000 
I'm ashamed to be your daughter. 

1122
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:16,340 
Sir, there is an open hangar door 
on deck 13. 

1123
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:18,920 
Khan. 

1124
01:31:19,730 --> 01:31:21,700 
They will have full power 
and we walk? 

1125
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:24,170 
Turbofit easily tracked 
and we will be trapped. 

1126
01:31:24,390 --> 01:31:26,260 
The path to the engine room. 

1127
01:31:26,830 --> 01:31:29,780 
They can not use guns 
here without damaging the warp core 

1128
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:30,970 
give us a chance. 

1129
01:31:31,330 --> 01:31:33,350 
- Where did you find this guy? 
- Long story. 

1130
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:35,160 
I'll be quick. 

1131
01:31:36,410 --> 01:31:39,240 
In your journey, you never 
met a man named Khan? 

1132
01:31:44,610 --> 01:31:47,780 
You know I swear to 
not give information ... 

1133
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:50,240 
... That could change your destiny. 

1134
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:56,620 
You have to live your own path. 

1135
01:32:00,170 --> 01:32:02,060 
But ... 

1136
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:07,560 
Khan Noonien Singh is ... 
The most dangerous enemy ... 

1137
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:09,190 
Enterprise ... ever faced. 

1138
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,670 
He's smart, ruthless ... 

1139
01:32:13,330 --> 01:32:17,790 
And will not hesitate ... 
to kill you. 

1140
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:23,240 
You did? 

1141
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:27,580 
With great sacrifice. 
Yes. 

1142
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:31,080 
The trick? 

1143
01:32:31,370 --> 01:32:33,460 
Instead of wanting to tempt fate, 
but where is everyone? 

1144
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:35,800 
The vessel is designed for little crew - 
one person, if necessary. 

1145
01:32:58,430 --> 01:33:00,460 
- Are you okay? 
- Yes. 
Where Khan? 

1146
01:33:06,050 --> 01:33:10,690 
Lieutenant, collect all senior staff 
and medical technicians in space weapons. 

1147
01:33:11,150 --> 01:33:12,180 
Alright. 

1148
01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:17,040 
Dr.. 
McCoy, you do not 
accidentally activate the torpedo. 

1149
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:18,350 
Can repeat the process? 

1150
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:19,670 
Why would I do that? 

1151
01:33:19,670 --> 01:33:21,300 
I'm not an expert torpedo. 

1152
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:24,470 
Because you doctor then 
I want you to listen very carefully. 

1153
01:33:26,290 --> 01:33:27,000 
Where is he? 

1154
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:33,890 
Damn! 

1155
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:35,840 
This way. 

1156
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:41,070 
Once we arrived at the bridge, 
Shoot him. 

1157
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:44,940 
Take him? 
Khan? 
I think he helps us. 

1158
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:46,950 
We are the ones who help him. 

1159
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:58,510 
- Power is back, sir. 
- Navigate to the Enterprise shot! 

1160
01:33:58,780 --> 01:33:59,160 

1161
01:34:13,490 --> 01:34:14,610 
Make sure he's still unconscious. 

1162
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:17,240 
- Excuse me. 
- Yes. 

1163
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:22,780 
Admiral Marcus, you're under arrest. 

1164
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:25,220 
You're not serious, right? 

1165
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:29,300 
Admiral, down from the chair. 

1166
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:31,420 
Should refrain 
and think about what you did, Kirk. 

1167
01:34:32,090 --> 01:34:33,830 
Think about what you did at Kronos. 

1168
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:38,940 
You attack the enemy planet! 
You killed the Klingon patrol. 

1169
01:34:39,130 ​​--> 01:34:42,640 
Even if you escape without a trace, 
war will happen. 

1170
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:45,310 
Then who will 
lead us? 

1171
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:50,390 
If I do not lead, 
our lives will be destroyed! 

1172
01:34:51,450 --> 01:34:53,500 
So if you want to 
I got off the boat ... 

1173
01:34:54,170 --> 01:34:56,000 
... Kill me. 

1174
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:57,920 
I will not kill you, sir. 

1175
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:02,790 
But you can kulumpuhkan 
and kuseret you down from the chair. 

1176
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,710 
I do not want to do that 
in front of your daughter. 

1177
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:12,140 
- Yes Captain. 

1178
01:35:28,630 --> 01:35:30,090 
Listen. 
Wait! 

1179
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:47,210 
You should have let me sleep. 

1180
01:35:52,590 --> 01:35:53,990 
Where's Captain, Tn. 
Sulu? 

1181
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:56,080 
Sensors we die, sir. 
I can not find it. 

1182
01:35:58,030 --> 01:35:59,870 
This will kupermudah for you. 

1183
01:35:59,870 --> 01:36:00,700 
Captain! 

1184
01:36:00,700 --> 01:36:02,690 
Awakmu replace my crew. 

1185
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:04,110 
You betrayed us. 

1186
01:36:04,110 --> 01:36:06,070 
You're very clever, Tn. 

1187
01:36:06,390 --> 01:36:07,310 
Spock, do - 

1188
01:36:10,190 --> 01:36:13,060 
Spock, give my crew. 

1189
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:15,690 
What are you doing 
after that? 

1190
01:36:15,690 --> 01:36:17,840 
Continuing our work 
before we were discharged. 

1191
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:18,990 
Which, I know of ... 

1192
01:36:18,990 --> 01:36:22,830 
involves slaughter 
all creatures you weak. 

1193
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,880 
I need to kill you, Tn. 
Spock? 

1194
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:28,080 
Or are you going to give my request? 

1195
01:36:30,970 --> 01:36:32,690 
We do not have the ability to transfer. 

1196
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:34,910 
Luckily mine functions 
properly. 

1197
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:36,730 
Lower your shield. 

1198
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:40,860 
If I did, there's no guarantee you 
would destroy the Enterprise. 

1199
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:43,460 
Let's use logic, Tn. 

1200
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,920 
First, I will kill your captain 
as evidence of seriousness. 

1201
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:52,280 
And if you insist, 
I'll kill you and the whole awakmu. 

1202
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:56,510 
Awakmu will be killed 
if you destroy our ship. 

1203
01:36:56,510 --> 01:37:00,840 
Awakmu need oxygen, my crew is not. 
Kubidik life support system ... 

1204
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:03,410 
Located ... in the back of the boat. 

1205
01:37:03,510 --> 01:37:06,540 
After each person 
in your boat out of breath ... 

1206
01:37:06,890 --> 01:37:11,070 
Kulangkahi thrown you will ... 
to pick up my crew. 

1207
01:37:14,070 --> 01:37:14,880 
Now ... 

1208
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:17,610 
... Can we start? 

1209
01:37:22,090 --> 01:37:22,830 
Lower the shield. 

1210
01:37:26,860 --> 01:37:28,100 
A wise choice, Tn.
Spock. 

1211
01:37:37,530 --> 01:37:40,120 
I saw 72 torpedomu still 
inside the tube. 

1212
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:42,710 
If not mine, 
I would know. 

1213
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,470 
Vulcan man could not lie. 

1214
01:37:46,370 --> 01:37:48,260 
Torpedoes it yours. 

1215
01:37:59,130 ​​--> 01:38:00,530 
Thank you, Mr.. 

1216
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:02,380 
Fulfill your have your terms. 

1217
01:38:03,870 --> 01:38:05,110 
Now meet my terms. 

1218
01:38:06,230 --> 01:38:07,020 
Kirk ... 

1219
01:38:08,330 --> 01:38:10,360 
I'll return to you ... awakmu. 

1220
01:38:11,470 --> 01:38:12,580 
Anyway ... 

1221
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:19,390 
Captain had drowned ... 
with his ship. 

1222
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:23,440 
He's our aim with lasers! 

1223
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:30,580 
Get us! 

1224
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:41,010 
Shield at 6 percent! 

1225
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:43,420 
Torpedoes! 
How much longer? 

1226
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:44,750 
12 seconds, sir! 

1227
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:47,840 
The crew of the Enterprise, 
be prepared for the explosion. 

1228
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,520 
What does he mean? 
What explosion? 

1229
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:51,680 
Torpedoes. 
He activates torpedoes! 

1230
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:11,940 
Their arms paralyzed. 

1231
01:39:13,090 --> 01:39:15,310 
- Not bad, Commander. 
- Thank you, Lieutenant. 

1232
01:39:17,050 --> 01:39:17,460 
Bones! 

1233
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:18,010 
Nurse! 

1234
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:20,390 
Dr.. 
Marcus. 

1235
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:24,050 
Glad to see you, Jim. 

1236
01:39:24,380 --> 01:39:26,040 
You're helping Spock 
detonate torpedoes? 

1237
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:27,160 
Sure. 

1238
01:39:27,590 --> 01:39:28,670 
He killed the crew Khan! 

1239
01:39:28,670 --> 01:39:32,620 
Spock's cool, but not as cold as it was. 
Khan crew there to me. 

1240
01:39:32,890 --> 01:39:36,880 
72 ice man safe 
are in their kriorganik tube. 

1241
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:39,240 
Not playing! 

1242
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:47,060 
The main power weakened. 

1243
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:50,020 
- Move to backup power. 
- Power down backup, sir. 

1244
01:39:58,270 --> 01:39:59,970 
Sir, we ship stuck Earth's gravity! 

1245
01:40:00,230 --> 01:40:02,280 
- Can we stop? 
- I can not anything. 

1246
01:40:13,780 --> 01:40:14,810 
Clear the area. 

1247
01:40:15,820 --> 01:40:18,740 
Perform emergency locking! 
I hope you do not get seasick. 

1248
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:20,560 
- Do you? 
- Yes. 

1249
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:22,380 
Lieutenant, ordered the evacuation, 
the entire deck. 

1250
01:40:24,690 --> 01:40:27,530 
As a captain, 
I tell you to leave the ship. 

1251
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:30,840 
I will live and 
power beat ... 

1252
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:32,770 
to support living and evacuation. 

1253
01:40:35,050 --> 01:40:36,960 
I tell you to leave the ship! 

1254
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:40,530 
Sorry, the commander, but we 
will not go away. 

1255
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:47,140 
One day I was on this ship! 
One day. 

1256
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:54,150 
Gravity system weakened. 
Hold on! 

1257
01:40:58,470 --> 01:41:01,470 
<i> Attention all decks. 
Evacuation procedures are run. </ I> 

1258
01:41:01,990 --> 01:41:04,970 
<i> Going to space out 
and report to your ship. </ i> 

1259
01:41:05,210 --> 01:41:09,640 
There would be no evacuation if there is no 
effort to stabilize the ship! 

1260
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:12,270 
- Can we recover? 
- Only from the engine room. 

1261
01:41:12,740 --> 01:41:14,740 
We need to warp core. 

1262
01:41:17,180 --> 01:41:18,690 
Jim? 

1263
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:22,260 
Scotty we need 
energy back! 

1264
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:41,600 
Scotty, we have to jump! 

1265
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:42,840 
Jump! 

1266
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:43,690 
Yes, Lord. 

1267
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,350 
Emergency power 
at 15 percent and declining. 

1268
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:52,280 
<i> Emergency procedures began. </ i> 

1269

- Hold on! 

1271
01:42:09,870 --> 01:42:10,550 
I can not. 

1272
01:42:30,050 --> 01:42:31,190 
I got you, Captain. 

1273
01:42:31,350 --> 01:42:33,470 
- Chekov. 
- Do not be released. 

1274
01:42:44,410 --> 01:42:47,130 
Although essentially re-active, 
we had to switch tenganya! 

1275
01:42:47,130 --> 01:42:48,660 
- He's right! 
- What do you mean? 

1276
01:42:48,970 --> 01:42:52,220 
There should be a move 
manually. 
Button - 

1277
01:42:52,370 --> 01:42:54,380 
Behind the deflector dish. 
Will flick! 

1278
01:42:54,650 --> 01:42:55,370 
Come on! 

1279
01:43:13,910 --> 01:43:16,960 
<i> Attention!

Evacuation procedures in the run. </ I> 

1280
01:43:18,570 --> 01:43:20,390 
Divert the rest of the power 
to the stabilizer. 

1281
01:43:20,650 --> 01:43:22,070 
I tried my best. 

1282
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:41,530 
<i> warp core is not aligned. 
Danger. </ I> 

1283
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:42,840 
Oh, no! 

1284
01:43:43,510 --> 01:43:46,250 
The structure is not aligned! 
Can not megalihkan power! 

1285
01:43:46,660 --> 01:43:49,310 
This ship is dead, sir. 

1286
01:43:51,370 --> 01:43:52,130 
No. 

1287
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,370 
Wait! 
Jim! 
We're going to die if there! 

1288
01:43:55,370 --> 01:43:57,610 
Listen to me! 
You want what? 

1289
01:43:57,790 --> 01:43:58,570 
I'm going to go. 

1290
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:01,290 
The door was blocking 
so we are not subject to radiation. 

1291
01:44:01,290 --> 01:44:02,960 
We will die before the climb! 

1292
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:07,220 
You would not climb. 

1293
01:44:11,550 --> 01:44:13,300 
Core <i> not parallel. </ i> 

1294
01:45:12,990 --> 01:45:16,690 
If power or shield back, 
we will burn up in the atmosphere. 

1295
01:46:23,990 --> 01:46:25,110 
Active warp core! 

1296
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:26,550 
Full speed, Tn. 
Sulu! 

1297
01:46:31,950 --> 01:46:34,530 
Full speed ahead! 
Wait. 

1298
01:47:01,930 --> 01:47:03,950 
- Shielding recovered! 
- Commanders, active force. 

1299
01:47:04,670 --> 01:47:06,820 
Tn. 
Spock, altitude began to stabilize. 

1300
01:47:07,130 --> 01:47:08,080 
It's magical. 

1301
01:47:10,690 --> 01:47:12,200 
Such a thing does not exist. 

1302
01:47:15,090 --> 01:47:16,510 
<i> Engineering to the bridge, Tn. 
Spock! </ I>

Scott. 

1304
01:47:17,740 --> 01:47:20,300 
Sir, you'd better come here. 

1305
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:21,480 
Hurry. 

1306
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:45,360 
Open the. 

1307
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:47,310 
Decontamination has not been completed. 

1308
01:47:47,310 --> 01:47:50,060 
You're going to flood the entire space. 
The door was locked. 

1309
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:22,660 
How do we ship? 

1310
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:25,400 
Escape from danger. 

1311
01:48:28,330 --> 01:48:29,650 
You saved the crew. 

1312
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:34,500 
You use what he wants 
to defeat it. 

1313
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:40,150 
It was a smart move. 

1314
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:43,750 
That's what you're gonna do. 

1315
01:48:46,430 --> 01:48:47,300 
And this ... 

1316
01:48:48,350 --> 01:48:50,380 
Is this ... are you gonna do. 

1317
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,080 
It was only logical. 

1318
01:48:58,620 --> 01:49:00,300 
I'm afraid, Spock. 

1319
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:05,510 
Help me to not be afraid. 

1320
01:49:10,230 --> 01:49:12,270 
How did you choose 
to not feel? 

1321
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:19,640 
I do not know. 

1322
01:49:22,550 --> 01:49:24,320 
This time I failed. 

1323
01:49:31,140 --> 01:49:34,060 
I want you to know why 
I can not let you die. 

1324
01:49:37,230 --> 01:49:38,750 
Why did I come back to you. 

1325
01:49:41,230 --> 01:49:42,720 
Because you're my friend. 

1326
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:06,660 
Khan! 

1327
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:10,110 
Gosh, that was close! 

1328
01:51:13,250 --> 01:51:16,950 
Set goals, Starfleet Headquarters! 

1329
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:21,090 
<i> Machine weakened. 
Not guaranteed to arrive at the destination. </ I>

1332
01:52:25,450 --> 01:52:29,450 
- Check the ship was, is there any survivors? 
- There can be no survivors. 

1333
01:52:31,010 --> 01:52:32,170 
He survived. 

1334
01:52:32,980 --> 01:52:33,460 
Yes, sir. 

1335
01:53:04,210 --> 01:53:05,690 
He jumped as high as 30 feet! 

1336
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:06,990 
Can we pindahi him? 

1337
01:53:06,990 --> 01:53:09,200 
Too much damage. 
There is no incoming signal. 

1338
01:53:09,790 --> 01:53:12,110 
Maybe we could 
move you, sir. 

1339
01:53:13,020 --> 01:53:13,870 
Catch him. 

1340
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:20,710 
Waiting coordinates. 

1341
01:53:21,890 --> 01:53:24,330 
3517 per 2598 entries. 

1342
01:53:24,330 --> 01:53:25,450 
Coordinates confirmed. 

1343
01:54:59,510 --> 01:55:01,400 
Give me a cryogenic tube, now! 

1344
01:55:54,650 --> 01:55:57,540 
Get him out of the tube krigenik. 
Keep him still comatose. 

1345
01:55:57,910 --> 01:56:01,160 
We put Kirk in the - 
so his brain remains active. 

1346
01:56:01,160 --> 01:56:03,700 
- How much blood the rest of Khan? 
- Nothing. 

1347
01:56:04,690 --> 01:56:07,610 
Enterprise to Spock. 
Spock! 

1348
01:57:05,710 --> 01:57:07,120 
Enable cryogenic circuit. 

1349
01:57:09,990 --> 01:57:11,050 
McCoy to the bridge. 

1350
01:57:11,050 --> 01:57:14,190 
I can not call Spock. 
I need Khan alive. 

1351
01:57:14,190 --> 01:57:16,780 
Bring that bastard here now! 

1352
01:57:17,930 --> 01:57:19,630 
He could save Kirk. 

1353
01:57:19,630 --> 01:57:20,900 
Can we pindahi them? 

1354
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:23,340 
They keep moving! 
I can not lock both. 

1355
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:24,910 
Pindahi can someone out there. 

1356
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:08,130 
Spock, stop! 

1357
01:58:09,710 --> 01:58:12,060 
He's the only chance 
to save Kirk. 

1358
01:58:21,870 --> 01:58:23,230 
- What kind of sex? 
- Male. 

1359
01:58:24,550 --> 01:58:25,310 
Let's call Jim 

1360
01:58:25,310 --> 01:58:28,290 
Your father was captain of a starship so 
for 12 minutes. 

1361
01:58:28,830 --> 01:58:30,950 
He saved 800 lives. 
Kuantang you do better. 

1362
01:58:38,980 --> 01:58:41,810 
Do not over-dramatize. 
You're just dead a while. 

1363
01:58:42,780 --> 01:58:44,640 
Transfusinya took effect. 

1364
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:47,200 
- You're unconscious two weeks. 
- Transfusion. 

1365
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:49,770 
Your cells are exposed to radiation. 
We had no choice. 

1366
01:58:50,770 --> 01:58:51,780 
Khan? 

1367
01:58:52,530 --> 01:58:55,740 
Once we got him, 
I made the blood serum of the superclass. 

1368
01:58:55,890 --> 01:58:59,960 
Tell me, what do you feel like to kill? 
Power hungry? 
Despot? 

1369
01:59:00,130 --> 01:59:01,640 
Ordinary. 

1370
01:59:02,190 --> 01:59:03,500 
How did you catch it? 

1371
01:59:04,350 --> 01:59:05,080 
Not me. 

1372
01:59:13,700 --> 01:59:15,100 
You saved my life. 

1373
01:59:15,570 --> 01:59:17,840 
Uhura and I also took part. 

1374
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:21,660 
You saved me, Captain. 
And souls - 

1375
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:23,230 
Spock, anyway ... 

1376
