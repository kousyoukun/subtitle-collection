1
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:40,059
If you're going to throw it away,
then don't give birth.

2
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,314
Please take care of her.

3
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:15,713
Anything?

4
00:04:19,182 --> 00:04:20,416
She probably ran away.

5
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:23,628
I guess so.

6
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:26,214
Give me the towel.

7
00:04:35,464 --> 00:04:37,184
Woosung, I'm sorry.

8
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,170
I'll be sure to come pick you up.

9
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:42,648
Here we go again.
I'll come pick him up.

10
00:04:42,777 --> 00:04:44,110
No number...

11
00:04:46,927 --> 00:04:48,948
They have no intention of doing that.

12
00:04:50,004 --> 00:04:52,159
Hey, hurry up and delete the video.

13
00:05:00,749 --> 00:05:03,630
Your eyes are bright too, huh?

14
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:06,826
Just not much hair on the eyebrows.

15
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,844
Even so, you're such a cute kid.

16
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:13,123
How could they think of
getting rid of you? Really, huh?

17
00:05:14,827 --> 00:05:16,436
So, you're Woosung.

18
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:18,646
That's right, Woosung.

19
00:05:19,484 --> 00:05:22,984
You can be happy with us now. OK?

20
00:05:23,718 --> 00:05:24,756
Right?

21
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,741
<i>For those wanting to transfer
to a bus or an express bus,</i>

22
00:07:47,765 --> 00:07:49,750
<i>please exit now.</i>

23
00:08:01,108 --> 00:08:03,967
<i>The exit for the Busan
West Intercity Bus Terminal,</i>

24
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:05,809
<i>is exit 3.</i>

25
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:08,036
<i>Gimhae International Airport is...</i>

26
00:09:02,602 --> 00:09:04,111
- How's your knee?
- Huh?

27
00:09:04,135 --> 00:09:06,451
- Your knees hurt, right?
- Yes, I'm okay.

28
00:09:06,475 --> 00:09:08,393
- You okay?
- Oh, it's gotten a lot better.

29
00:09:08,566 --> 00:09:09,774
Okay.

30
00:09:09,804 --> 00:09:10,961
You should come more often.

31
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:12,594
It'll be good for you
to exercise.

32
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,292
It's been a while, so I just want
to rest whenever I come here.

33
00:09:16,071 --> 00:09:17,956
Is the laundry doing well these days?

34
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,015
It's so-so...

35
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,218
<i>Hey Socrates...</i>

36
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,500
By the way,

37
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:12,001
I can't believe
they're thinking of

38
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:13,546
using baby boxes
for human trafficking.

39
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,323
That's really bold.

40
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,960
It's their fault for making
those boxes in the first place

41
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,848
it's creating irresponsible mothers...

42
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,602
You have a nice side to you.

43
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,979
Why?

44
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:30,374
Oh, that baby.

45
00:10:30,398 --> 00:10:33,283
He would've died
if he had been left on that floor.

46
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:37,578
I am nice.

47
00:10:38,352 --> 00:10:39,491
You didn't know?

48
00:10:40,562 --> 00:10:42,835
Was it a boy or a girl?

49
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:51,226
- Hello.
- How have you been?

50
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:52,463
You worked hard.

51
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,882
That dish last time was really good

52
00:10:56,183 --> 00:10:58,449
It was Shu, Shu...

53
00:10:58,552 --> 00:11:01,013
- Schweinshaxen.
- Oh, Schweinshaxen.

54
00:11:01,345 --> 00:11:02,909
The day after

55
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:04,951
I was so surprised
because my skin was so smooth.

56
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:06,977
What are you saying?
It's just pig's feet.

57
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,398
And, uh,
do you happen to know Choucroute?

58
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:11,710
I'm gonna try making that next.

59
00:11:11,734 --> 00:11:13,796
You should come to have a bite.

60
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,862
It's just boiled pork. It's bland.

61
00:11:16,394 --> 00:11:18,675
I left the white one at the laundry.

62
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:20,011
I brought it in black instead.

63
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:21,638
- It's thick.
- Oh, thanks.

64
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:23,723
- And this too, just in case...
- Right, thanks.

65
00:11:23,747 --> 00:11:25,374
- Go, okay, go.
- Okay.

66
00:11:27,412 --> 00:11:29,086
- Take care.
- Yeah, okay.

67
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:34,593
Whatever the situation is,

68
00:11:34,617 --> 00:11:37,029
you should get out of the car
and say goodbye...

69
00:11:37,053 --> 00:11:38,280
It's fine.

70
00:11:38,304 --> 00:11:40,060
He stays home all day anyways.

71
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:41,683
It's good for him
to get some exercise.

72
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:45,103
He's a perfect match
for a marriage partner.

73
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:46,225
Oh, really?

74
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,662
What about it? Do you want him?

75
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,890
Because even if you have a kid,

76
00:11:50,914 --> 00:11:53,218
he can look after the kid
since he writes from home...

77
00:11:55,553 --> 00:11:56,977
The baby's mother came to see him?

78
00:12:02,094 --> 00:12:03,164
Is something wrong?

79
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:05,187
Yes.

80
00:12:05,797 --> 00:12:08,252
They left the baby
outside. Outside the box.

81
00:12:12,324 --> 00:12:14,593
Could it have been a mistake?
Because she was flustered?

82
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:24,008
Hey, if you think they're gonna go to
the police just bring the baby here, OK?

83
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:26,062
I'll do that.

84
00:12:27,993 --> 00:12:28,994
Okay.

85
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:37,627
There's nothing on the records...

86
00:12:40,651 --> 00:12:41,932
Call the pastor.

87
00:12:41,956 --> 00:12:44,597
And can you please give Soo-kyung
a bath for me?

88
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:45,877
OK, sure.

89
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:52,300
You were on night
watch yesterday, right?

90
00:12:53,318 --> 00:12:55,556
Yes, every Sunday...

91
00:12:56,324 --> 00:12:59,432
Can you show her
some of the babies you have now?

92
00:13:04,942 --> 00:13:06,682
This is a playroom for big kids.

93
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:09,443
There are 19 kids living here.

94
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:12,391
They're all abandoned in the baby box.

95
00:13:18,904 --> 00:13:20,789
He came in last week...

96
00:13:21,006 --> 00:13:22,874
The mother was 15 years old...

97
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:26,378
His mom is from Pakistan.

98
00:13:27,686 --> 00:13:29,756
She said she was a babysitter.

99
00:13:31,006 --> 00:13:32,260
That's it?

100
00:13:34,858 --> 00:13:36,055
Yes, for now.

101
00:13:38,842 --> 00:13:42,131
What about letters?
Did you put a letter with the baby?

102
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:45,562
Yes.

103
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:49,554
How about your name and contact number?
Did you write that, too?

104
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:55,200
So even if you have a baby,

105
00:13:55,572 --> 00:13:57,452
there's no evidence
that you're the mother...

106
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,747
What's going on?

107
00:14:01,071 --> 00:14:03,876
She's looking for a baby named Woosung.

108
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:08,299
She says she left a baby
outside the baby box yesterday.

109
00:14:09,806 --> 00:14:13,114
If you had put the baby in the box,
our staff would have gone out

110
00:14:13,138 --> 00:14:14,846
right away and spoken to you.

111
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,873
Yes.

112
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:18,475
- That's what I said.
- Peek-a-boo.

113
00:14:18,744 --> 00:14:20,604
Peek-a-boo!

114
00:14:59,771 --> 00:15:00,854
Of course, not.

115
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:04,149
Kidnapping?

116
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:06,860
What are you talking about?

117
00:15:07,425 --> 00:15:08,488
Hey, don't you think so?

118
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:11,425
You threw him away.

119
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,053
What are you talking about?
I just left him with you for a bit.

120
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:16,150
Do you think we're like a dog hotel?

121
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:20,250
I even wrote in the letter
that I'd come and pick him up.

122
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:26,835
If there's a message saying

123
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,169
you're coming back for the baby,

124
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,887
the church takes
the baby off the adoption list.

125
00:15:31,546 --> 00:15:33,523
He's 100% going to a childcare facility.

126
00:15:34,256 --> 00:15:35,642
Do you know what that means?

127
00:15:36,451 --> 00:15:39,399
Well, I'm sure you did it out of love,

128
00:15:39,463 --> 00:15:43,175
but that's what narrows down
this kid's future possibilities.

129
00:15:44,265 --> 00:15:45,484
We...

130
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:47,196
uh, Woosung...

131
00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:52,159
we want to save Woosung
from that dark future.

132
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:55,967
It's better for him
to grow up in a nice home

133
00:15:56,047 --> 00:15:58,667
than to be an orphan
in a childcare facility...

134
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,670
It's much better.

135
00:16:05,071 --> 00:16:06,071
Adoption.

136
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,802
We're looking for parents to raise him.

137
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:11,782
You don't have the right to do that.

138
00:16:11,806 --> 00:16:14,034
You don't have the right either,
you abandoned him.

139
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:16,203
- You stole him.
- To protect.

140
00:16:16,227 --> 00:16:19,582
Yes, of course.
We don't have the right. We don't.

141
00:16:19,606 --> 00:16:22,316
In other words...

142
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:25,042
Should I say it's with good intentions?

143
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:27,795
Good intentions...

144
00:16:28,705 --> 00:16:31,339
I haven't heard those words in a while.

145
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,098
There are people wanting children
but can't have them

146
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:35,964
and can't wait
for the screening period,

147
00:16:35,989 --> 00:16:38,642
we can send the baby to those parents.

148
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:43,298
You're in an explainable situation.

149
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,826
Your name is...

150
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:49,555
It's Seon-ah, Moon Seon-ah.

151
00:16:49,747 --> 00:16:50,950
Miss Seon-ah.

152
00:16:50,974 --> 00:16:54,457
You can think of us as a cupid

153
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,321
that sends your precious baby
to those parents.

154
00:16:56,715 --> 00:17:00,567
I promise to find
the best adoptive parents for Woosung.

155
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:04,372
Cupid my ass.

156
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,240
Yeah, well,
it's a bit strange to call us that...

157
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:08,877
What's another good name...

158
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:12,120
Should we call ourselves the storks?
Since it's two of us, two storks?

159
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:14,475
Oh, and...

160
00:17:14,499 --> 00:17:18,628
It's case by case,
but there's a little reward.

161
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,226
A reward?

162
00:17:22,218 --> 00:17:23,591
How much was it?

163
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:27,637
It's about 10 million won for a boy.

164
00:17:28,162 --> 00:17:29,388
For who?

165
00:17:29,786 --> 00:17:34,308
Of course,
for you and us, the mediators...

166
00:17:39,461 --> 00:17:41,318
Good intentions my ass.

167
00:17:42,265 --> 00:17:44,446
You're just a broker.

168
00:17:47,242 --> 00:17:49,602
To put it simply, yes.

169
00:17:56,587 --> 00:17:58,587
When is the departure?

170
00:18:04,526 --> 00:18:06,697
- Get some rest.
- Yes, go home.

171
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:07,973
Yes.

172
00:18:12,979 --> 00:18:15,480
She's the mother of that baby, right?

173
00:18:17,073 --> 00:18:18,650
I'm not sure.

174
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:23,424
She doesn't look like it...

175
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:35,902
Oh, Taeho.

176
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:37,869
What are doing h...

177
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,835
Oh, hello.

178
00:18:41,724 --> 00:18:43,802
We're temporarily closed for today..

179
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:47,347
I don't know if this can be removed...

180
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:51,393
Oh, this...

181
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:53,540
This is...

182
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:55,607
It's obviously blood.

183
00:18:57,506 --> 00:18:58,902
I'll give it a try.

184
00:18:59,412 --> 00:19:00,904
And, the

185
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:03,299
the money could be here by next week...

186
00:19:03,323 --> 00:19:05,700
We're going to open
a chicken restaurant here.

187
00:19:08,935 --> 00:19:10,849
Well, if you can't,
I'll take you to the casino.

188
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:13,208
No. I'm not going back.

189
00:19:14,235 --> 00:19:16,212
I guess he has another solution.

190
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,817
Then you'll have 5,000 by next week

191
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:20,777
and please take care of that shirt.

192
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:22,093
Okay.

193
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,431
Goodbye.

194
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,809
Hey, Taeho.

195
00:19:29,891 --> 00:19:32,855
Since when have you been hanging out
with thugs like that?

196
00:19:33,454 --> 00:19:34,940
Why are you nagging me?

197
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:38,277
Mind your own business, old man.

198
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:42,157
You were doing a good
at the restaurant with your mom.

199
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:45,619
Those noodles
make me sick to my stomach now.

200
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:07,015
What was that?

201
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,687
Nothing. They came to complain.

202
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,066
And fix this.

203
00:20:14,432 --> 00:20:18,445
There's a trick to it.
Press it to the left.

204
00:20:30,108 --> 00:20:31,668
Do we have to take her?

205
00:20:32,536 --> 00:20:35,881
Well, it's good to have his mother
around, it'll be less suspicious.

206
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:39,635
Ms. Sun-ah, let's go, let's go.

207
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,079
It's like she's crazy for money.

208
00:20:43,232 --> 00:20:45,616
- 50-50?
- That's right.

209
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:47,644
At least divide it into three...

210
00:20:50,091 --> 00:20:52,262
If we take the Gyeongbu
Expressway to Yeongdeok,

211
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:53,872
it will take us 2
hours and 30 minutes.

212
00:20:53,897 --> 00:20:57,552
We'll take a break at the rest stop
in Gyeongju around lunch time.

213
00:21:26,914 --> 00:21:31,614
They wouldn't go too far
with a car like that, right?

214
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:35,637
Maybe Ulsan or Pohang?

215
00:21:40,962 --> 00:21:44,242
I wanna take a shower
and change as soon as possible.

216
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:47,457
You know, right?

217
00:21:47,877 --> 00:21:52,088
We're gonna catch them red-handed.

218
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,560
Ms. Sun-ah, where are you from?

219
00:22:08,685 --> 00:22:10,066
I'm from Busan.

220
00:22:11,544 --> 00:22:15,923
He's self-proclaimed from Seoul.

221
00:22:15,947 --> 00:22:17,098
Self-proclaimed?

222
00:22:19,466 --> 00:22:20,801
Where are you from then?

223
00:22:21,483 --> 00:22:22,704
Yeosu.

224
00:22:23,497 --> 00:22:24,706
Yeosu?

225
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:27,938
There's nothing
but gondolas there, isn't it?

226
00:22:28,193 --> 00:22:29,628
Cable car.

227
00:22:29,862 --> 00:22:31,547
The sashimi is good there.

228
00:22:31,952 --> 00:22:33,872
The leaf mustard kimchi is good too...
What that?

229
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:47,237
Remember when we went to sell a kid.

230
00:22:48,512 --> 00:22:50,597
And it was a male couple?

231
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,964
Oh, yeah, that's right, that's right.

232
00:22:52,988 --> 00:22:56,365
That was in Yeosu.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

233
00:22:56,766 --> 00:23:00,119
I wonder how he grew up?
He must be in elementary school by now.

234
00:23:00,394 --> 00:23:03,956
Night beach at Yeosu.

235
00:23:08,383 --> 00:23:11,692
Stop talking nonsense.
Leave the negotiations to us.

236
00:23:11,716 --> 00:23:15,978
Yeah, the customer always comes first.

237
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,850
Think of them as
people who chose to buy...

238
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:18,992
Hey, hey...

239
00:23:19,016 --> 00:23:20,016
- What?
- They're coming.

240
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,103
Are you Mr. Lim Chang Ho?

241
00:23:24,996 --> 00:23:26,458
I'm the guy from Busan...

242
00:23:26,482 --> 00:23:28,301
- Yes, show us the baby.
- Yes, of course.

243
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,052
He just woke up from a nap...

244
00:23:31,847 --> 00:23:33,138
Beautiful, isn't he?

245
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:39,260
By any chance,
did you use Photoshop on his pictures?

246
00:23:39,536 --> 00:23:41,640
This one is not as
cute as the picture...

247
00:23:41,664 --> 00:23:43,333
It's only because he just woke up.

248
00:23:43,551 --> 00:23:45,854
No, you can see that even his eyebrows.

249
00:23:45,878 --> 00:23:47,313
It's too thin...

250
00:23:47,337 --> 00:23:50,574
That's because he's a baby. His
eyes usually look like this, like this.

251
00:23:50,598 --> 00:23:52,736
He's a beautiful baby.
Woosung, open your eyes.

252
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,848
Open your eyes, go on.

253
00:23:53,872 --> 00:23:55,011
Let's make it 400.

254
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,380
But you said a thousand yesterday.

255
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:00,327
Even 400 is too much in this situation.

256
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:01,560
Right.

257
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:04,013
Or we can pay in installments.
Installments are OK, right?

258
00:24:04,037 --> 00:24:05,773
- 12-month installment.
- Yeah, that's good.

259
00:24:06,308 --> 00:24:08,347
Well, this is something
I've never heard of before.

260
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:10,958
You can't suddenly
put up such conditions.

261
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,198
What can you tell us about his father?

262
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,670
The father?

263
00:24:16,591 --> 00:24:17,727
The father, well...

264
00:24:17,842 --> 00:24:19,204
Hey, don't tell me

265
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:21,351
It's not rape
or something like that, is it?

266
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,211
- We can't be...
- What are you talking about?

267
00:24:23,235 --> 00:24:24,990
- Involved in something like that...
- No,

268
00:24:25,015 --> 00:24:27,835
No, the baby's mother right here
and she's a very diligent person.

269
00:24:27,874 --> 00:24:30,734
She's been all alone taking care
of her sick parents...

270
00:24:30,758 --> 00:24:32,552
Hey, you crazy punk.

271
00:24:33,735 --> 00:24:35,264
What, what, crazy?

272
00:24:35,977 --> 00:24:39,662
Talking about no eyebrows and
small eyes, have you seen your face?

273
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,788
What the fuck are you talking about?

274
00:24:41,812 --> 00:24:44,485
- Are you crazy?
- What, you bastard!

275
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:46,442
Ms. Sun-ah, Ms. Sun-ah. Okay.

276
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:51,239
What is this person doing? So rude...

277
00:24:51,517 --> 00:24:52,699
Rude?

278
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:57,305
Yeah, I'm damn rude.
Are you polite? Huh?

279
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:01,125
When you look at other people's babies
and talk nonsense. Are you being polite?

280
00:25:01,924 --> 00:25:05,430
I came all the way to
this crappy village and now what? 400?

281
00:25:05,705 --> 00:25:08,451
Is this a fucking joke Fuck that.

282
00:25:09,228 --> 00:25:11,963
I would never give
him to people like you.

283
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:15,348
Get the fuck out of here before I do
something I regret, you beggar bastard.

284
00:25:15,372 --> 00:25:18,101
What, beggars, really...

285
00:25:19,261 --> 00:25:20,626
Wait...

286
00:25:28,305 --> 00:25:31,577
Beggars...

287
00:25:31,636 --> 00:25:32,637
Seriously...

288
00:25:51,272 --> 00:25:54,424
Wanna get some crabs?
Everything is steamed in stores.

289
00:25:58,013 --> 00:25:59,230
That was harsh.

290
00:26:00,024 --> 00:26:01,814
Yeah, yeah, it was harsh.

291
00:26:01,892 --> 00:26:03,477
That's what I should be saying.

292
00:26:04,961 --> 00:26:06,862
He was a customer.

293
00:26:07,273 --> 00:26:08,711
We haggle with each other...

294
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,800
That's a customer.

295
00:26:10,824 --> 00:26:13,410
If he wasn't a customer,
I would've beaten the shit out of him.

296
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:18,791
That's how we negotiate...

297
00:26:20,093 --> 00:26:23,564
Well, with that attitude...
things won't go your...

298
00:26:23,588 --> 00:26:26,758
If you want to make it work,
find a better buyer.

299
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:30,553
That makes sense.

300
00:26:30,577 --> 00:26:33,871
What? 12-month installment plan
for 4 million won? Is this a joke?

301
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,328
What should we do?

302
00:26:40,783 --> 00:26:42,483
Shall we go back to Busan?

303
00:26:43,846 --> 00:26:46,779
We have no other choice.

304
00:26:49,001 --> 00:26:50,603
There are other candidates, right?

305
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,748
- Hello, sir.
- Hey.

306
00:26:57,401 --> 00:26:59,292
Is there any blood?

307
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:01,291
A little bit - Candy?

308
00:27:01,315 --> 00:27:02,355
Oh, thank you.

309
00:27:02,379 --> 00:27:03,797
Tomorrow is Children's Day.

310
00:27:04,031 --> 00:27:06,425
Yes, my grandmother gave me
allowance when I left for work.

311
00:27:11,825 --> 00:27:13,100
What about identification?

312
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,021
We're contacting his family now.

313
00:27:18,441 --> 00:27:19,690
What's the cause of death?

314
00:27:20,155 --> 00:27:22,155
I think he broke his neck
because he got beaten up.

315
00:27:23,966 --> 00:27:25,552
He's still young.

316
00:27:29,373 --> 00:27:31,411
I really hate blood.

317
00:27:34,314 --> 00:27:35,832
This view is amazing.

318
00:27:39,928 --> 00:27:41,255
Hmm.

319
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:43,728
A girl?

320
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,269
There will be more, right?

321
00:28:08,718 --> 00:28:10,983
They can't just go back to Busan...

322
00:28:12,242 --> 00:28:13,276
They can't do that.

323
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,048
Hi.

324
00:28:24,063 --> 00:28:26,886
That person over there has been
the director for three generations.

325
00:28:27,495 --> 00:28:29,516
He looks like
he's been working for 3 years, huh?

326
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:31,971
- Brother Dong-soo!
- Brother Dong-soo!

327
00:28:31,996 --> 00:28:33,655
- How have you been?
- Brother Dong-soo!

328
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,098
- Hi, how are you?
- Hello.

329
00:28:35,123 --> 00:28:37,123
- Bro, I'll show you this!
- It's brother Dong-soo!

330
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:39,569
- Hey, it's brother Dong-soo.
- Brother Dong-soo? Dong-soo?

331
00:28:39,594 --> 00:28:41,887
- Wow, it's Dong-soo!
- It's Dong-soo!

332
00:28:41,912 --> 00:28:43,530
It's brother Dong-soo.

333
00:28:43,668 --> 00:28:45,241
Wow, it's brother Dong-soo!

334
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,160
Really? For real?

335
00:28:54,747 --> 00:28:56,603
So that's why he wanted to come here.

336
00:28:56,627 --> 00:28:58,720
You should've called
to tell me you were coming.

337
00:28:59,327 --> 00:29:02,239
It looks like few are gone.

338
00:29:03,137 --> 00:29:06,069
Three kids, in about 6 months?

339
00:29:06,724 --> 00:29:09,535
Hey, I lose 450 a month

340
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:11,560
on subsidies
Hey, you guys go play now.

341
00:29:11,672 --> 00:29:13,103
- Go play.
- Let's go.

342
00:29:13,142 --> 00:29:15,560
Hey, the losing team
gets a finger flick, okay?

343
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,441
Hurry up and go.

344
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,361
What?

345
00:29:24,358 --> 00:29:26,033
He got a new wife.

346
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:29,579
Hey, she's too young.

347
00:29:29,803 --> 00:29:31,163
Oh? How did they meet?

348
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:34,210
A dating app?
Or something like that?

349
00:29:34,234 --> 00:29:36,820
Hey, you! Hey!

350
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,108
Hey, you idiot,
I told you not to go in there. Hey!

351
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:41,351
Can't you see that flower?

352
00:29:41,376 --> 00:29:43,075
How many times do I
have to tell you?

353
00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:44,396
Dong-soo! Let's play basketball.

354
00:29:44,421 --> 00:29:45,534
- Okay.
- Come on.

355
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:47,185
Nice, nice.

356
00:29:50,117 --> 00:29:53,318
Remember how you told the chief that

357
00:29:53,523 --> 00:29:58,016
they're selling infants
and the church was in on it?

358
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,528
The church is in on it.

359
00:30:00,157 --> 00:30:02,257
That young man is
also a church employee.

360
00:30:02,281 --> 00:30:03,481
I thought he was a part-timer?

361
00:30:04,627 --> 00:30:07,381
He's an employee,
just not a full employee.

362
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,979
But for a professional broker,

363
00:30:12,362 --> 00:30:14,210
they look like they're
doing a sloppy job...

364
00:30:17,864 --> 00:30:20,634
You added lukewarm water to this, right?

365
00:30:23,538 --> 00:30:25,473
It's because you didn't wait
for three minutes.

366
00:30:27,261 --> 00:30:30,978
Aren't you a professional broker
if you sell and get paid?

367
00:30:32,925 --> 00:30:34,774
That's right but...

368
00:30:36,922 --> 00:30:40,650
I feel like saying that they're behind
an organization is going too far.

369
00:30:41,868 --> 00:30:46,097
You don't like the detective department
talking shit to us, do you?

370
00:30:48,183 --> 00:30:49,276
Give it to me.

371
00:30:50,346 --> 00:30:51,412
Give me the ball.

372
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,585
No, no!

373
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,864
- That's not a goal! That's not a goal!
- Yoon-woo.

374
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,087
Yeah?

375
00:30:58,112 --> 00:31:00,573
Let Ha-jun borrow it now.

376
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,060
Haejin, that's enough football.

377
00:31:03,084 --> 00:31:04,472
Five more minutes please!

378
00:31:06,254 --> 00:31:08,274
He's not improving much, that kid.

379
00:31:14,265 --> 00:31:16,486
I see that the scar is still there.

380
00:31:19,889 --> 00:31:22,242
You bled so much when that happened.

381
00:31:22,718 --> 00:31:24,912
I called the ambulance and everything
It was crazy.

382
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:28,165
There was a kite on the branch,

383
00:31:28,252 --> 00:31:30,529
I was going to grab it
when it broke...

384
00:31:32,985 --> 00:31:35,464
Young-min is the only
troublemaker like that now.

385
00:31:36,852 --> 00:31:37,883
Young-min?

386
00:31:39,211 --> 00:31:40,679
Oh, Young-min?

387
00:31:41,431 --> 00:31:42,931
He's escaping now.

388
00:31:43,373 --> 00:31:44,391
Again?

389
00:31:47,033 --> 00:31:48,979
At least, that hasn't changed.

390
00:32:02,315 --> 00:32:03,661
I haven't heard from him.

391
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:05,746
Sorry to say...

392
00:32:08,065 --> 00:32:11,335
That's not why I visit anymore.

393
00:32:19,108 --> 00:32:23,265
Well, at first
it's like a blind date.

394
00:32:23,729 --> 00:32:24,829
Toe.

395
00:32:25,084 --> 00:32:27,187
Okay, I'll take a picture
and send it to you. Okay.

396
00:32:30,505 --> 00:32:34,069
His eyebrows are a bit thin, huh?

397
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,242
Excuse me for a second.

398
00:32:44,594 --> 00:32:46,576
- That's weird.
- Huh?

399
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:51,191
What? He looks strong with this.

400
00:32:51,983 --> 00:32:53,757
But why am I playing the wife?

401
00:32:57,381 --> 00:32:59,578
- Everyone here knows Dong-soo.
- Oh, it's a baby.

402
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,431
Then you can tell
them I'm your daughter.

403
00:33:01,456 --> 00:33:03,125
<i>So cute.</i>

404
00:33:04,711 --> 00:33:06,562
We don't look alike at all.

405
00:33:07,076 --> 00:33:08,958
Hey kid, don't touch him.

406
00:33:08,982 --> 00:33:10,441
Your hands are dirty from the ball.

407
00:33:10,898 --> 00:33:12,561
I said don't touch him.

408
00:33:12,585 --> 00:33:14,838
And we're doing this
until someone comes to buy him.

409
00:33:14,862 --> 00:33:18,100
What's the big deal?
Hey, don't touch him,

410
00:33:19,101 --> 00:33:20,501
your hands are dirty from the ball.

411
00:33:20,735 --> 00:33:22,329
He has weird eyebrows.

412
00:33:30,237 --> 00:33:31,964
Can I be your son?

413
00:33:32,448 --> 00:33:33,449
Why?

414
00:33:34,642 --> 00:33:35,969
I want to play football.

415
00:33:36,244 --> 00:33:37,262
Football?

416
00:33:37,454 --> 00:33:40,640
I want to make a lot
of money like Son Heung-min.

417
00:33:41,071 --> 00:33:44,102
Well, it hasn't been long
since Woosung was born...

418
00:33:44,806 --> 00:33:47,898
And it's too early to talk
about a second kid, right?

419
00:33:48,257 --> 00:33:50,652
Right, one's enough.

420
00:33:51,737 --> 00:33:53,978
It would be a good suggestion.

421
00:33:57,433 --> 00:34:00,954
There was a kid from here
who became a professional footballer.

422
00:34:01,048 --> 00:34:03,039
He wore... what was it,

423
00:34:03,063 --> 00:34:05,274
the team with stripes on their uniforms?

424
00:34:05,568 --> 00:34:06,669
No idea.

425
00:34:07,684 --> 00:34:10,600
Well, these facilities
they promote saying

426
00:34:10,624 --> 00:34:12,144
even people like us can succeed but

427
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:15,511
97% - Stop being a smart ass.

428
00:34:16,965 --> 00:34:19,140
3% is great, too.

429
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,852
Look at him getting riled up
about this place.

430
00:34:22,147 --> 00:34:24,479
What percent
of the average is successful then...

431
00:34:27,506 --> 00:34:28,692
Who is it?

432
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:33,238
They said he escaped.
Must've been caught and brought back.

433
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:36,826
I broke Dong-soo's record!

434
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:41,056
It took them 3 days to catch me.

435
00:34:42,023 --> 00:34:43,249
That's nothing to brag about.

436
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:46,711
Considering time and distance,
I was much ahead.

437
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,817
You must be real proud.

438
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:52,374
Yes, hello?

439
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:57,514
<i>Okay, I understand.
You're in Uljin, right?</i>

440
00:34:57,851 --> 00:34:59,558
<i>- No, no. That's alright.</i>
- What the hell?

441
00:35:00,226 --> 00:35:02,466
<i>- We'll see you tomorrow.</i>
- What's up with your eyebrows?

442
00:35:04,062 --> 00:35:06,782
Here is your order seafood doenjang.

443
00:35:12,228 --> 00:35:14,673
The coin laundromat...

444
00:35:14,782 --> 00:35:16,596
This is Si-woo, he
was a grade below me.

445
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,040
- I was the forward.
- Buttons.

446
00:35:18,065 --> 00:35:20,735
- And he was the midfielder.
- Do they attach the buttons?

447
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,173
Back then, we would've made
two football teams.

448
00:35:24,197 --> 00:35:25,554
- Don't you think so?
- Well now,

449
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:27,601
- When I go as a coach...
- I take the seams out

450
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:28,834
from pants they shortened

451
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:30,979
- 11 players...
- The worn out knees.

452
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,164
- They don't put a lining, right?
- No, there's no one.

453
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,616
You know that law, adoption...

454
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,142
Yeah, the adoption law.

455
00:35:39,815 --> 00:35:41,348
The conditions for
overseas adoptions

456
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:43,161
became more strict
so I thought it was good.

457
00:35:43,186 --> 00:35:45,646
But don't all the kids
want to be adopted?

458
00:35:46,871 --> 00:35:48,319
Oh, well...

459
00:35:48,626 --> 00:35:51,633
That kid that likes football,
he seems very active.

460
00:35:51,657 --> 00:35:53,519
Yes, Haejin.

461
00:35:54,887 --> 00:35:56,870
It's already too late for him.

462
00:35:57,473 --> 00:35:58,706
He's 7 years old.

463
00:35:59,161 --> 00:36:00,142
He's 8.

464
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:02,292
Oh, too late. Too late.

465
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:03,771
Too late for him.

466
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:06,941
Adoption... you can say
that's only for kids

467
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:09,973
below 6...

468
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,138
Even he should know by now...

469
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:18,935
There are also kids that come
because they don't want it.

470
00:36:19,162 --> 00:36:22,731
There was a case like
that recently, remember?

471
00:36:22,951 --> 00:36:25,012
The adopted child was abused.

472
00:36:27,038 --> 00:36:29,031
It's because blood
is thicker than water.

473
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,427
Think about what would've happened

474
00:36:31,451 --> 00:36:33,894
if the parents had a biological baby
after the adoption.

475
00:36:34,914 --> 00:36:38,999
Yeah, that's for most of the kids here
at least once, right?

476
00:36:39,718 --> 00:36:43,587
They were denied of their existence
when they were abandoned, right?

477
00:36:43,626 --> 00:36:45,579
And they experience it again.

478
00:36:46,507 --> 00:36:49,677
Then, I've been denied all my life.

479
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,898
What?

480
00:36:50,923 --> 00:36:53,033
Then do something about that whistle.

481
00:36:53,057 --> 00:36:54,432
You're not the military.

482
00:36:55,259 --> 00:36:56,267
Hey - The whistle.

483
00:36:56,829 --> 00:36:59,270
For me, it's like

484
00:37:00,142 --> 00:37:03,525
me wanting to be like a father to them.

485
00:37:03,634 --> 00:37:04,735
Understand?

486
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:09,239
So that's why I'm using this whistle
like this, OK?

487
00:37:16,581 --> 00:37:17,996
Hey, hurry up and hide.

488
00:37:31,448 --> 00:37:36,560
Good night, my baby.

489
00:37:38,543 --> 00:37:44,333
In the front garden and back garden,

490
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:50,885
birds and baby sheep,

491
00:37:52,529 --> 00:37:57,478
they're all asleep.

492
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,815
She was singing.

493
00:38:20,591 --> 00:38:21,693
What song?

494
00:38:23,024 --> 00:38:24,237
A lullaby.

495
00:38:25,211 --> 00:38:26,656
A lullaby?

496
00:38:32,222 --> 00:38:35,116
It's so nice here because
they have everything you need.

497
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,751
Let's take it all.

498
00:38:39,361 --> 00:38:40,754
Rub his earlobes like this.

499
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:43,215
You talk too much...

500
00:38:44,977 --> 00:38:46,336
Well, if we search a little more,

501
00:38:46,361 --> 00:38:48,654
we could find a someone
with better conditions.

502
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:50,556
Just go with the ones in Uljin.

503
00:38:51,046 --> 00:38:53,602
All done.

504
00:38:54,127 --> 00:38:56,730
You were so good during your bath.

505
00:38:57,197 --> 00:39:00,185
Your mom wants to say goodbye to you
as soon as possible.

506
00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:03,057
We're working so hard...

507
00:39:03,081 --> 00:39:05,282
Do you know how hard
it is to raise a child by yourself?

508
00:39:06,487 --> 00:39:08,411
That's still not a reason to

509
00:39:08,435 --> 00:39:09,723
abandon your child.

510
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,427
How are you going
to justify selling them?

511
00:39:11,452 --> 00:39:12,918
There are people
selling them because

512
00:39:12,942 --> 00:39:14,346
there are people
abandoning them.

513
00:39:14,371 --> 00:39:15,982
That's the right order.

514
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,731
Then you shouldn't have made that box.

515
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:21,684
That's what I'm saying.

516
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:23,944
It's only there to make the mothers
feel at ease

517
00:39:23,968 --> 00:39:26,197
by telling them we're saving
the baby or whatever.

518
00:39:26,221 --> 00:39:28,657
That's not the case.
Woosung is alive

519
00:39:28,681 --> 00:39:30,887
because of that box.

520
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:33,898
That wipe has alcohol in it
you can't wipe his face with that.

521
00:39:33,922 --> 00:39:35,309
Look at him crying.

522
00:39:37,107 --> 00:39:38,334
Sorry, I'm sorry.

523
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:40,438
Then how many mothers
do you think come back for them

524
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:42,797
after leaving only a letter behind?

525
00:39:42,821 --> 00:39:44,198
How would I know?

526
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:46,992
It's one out of forty.

527
00:39:47,298 --> 00:39:49,620
You never hear from
the other 39 ever again.

528
00:39:50,142 --> 00:39:53,725
Why are you only complaining about the
mothers? Say the same about the dads.

529
00:39:53,749 --> 00:39:56,377
You could've at least left
your contacts in the letter.

530
00:39:56,774 --> 00:39:58,700
This is the second time hearing that.

531
00:39:58,989 --> 00:40:00,966
What? You want me to tell you again?

532
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:02,860
I can tell you many times as you want.

533
00:40:02,884 --> 00:40:04,636
Who are you to be so arrogant?

534
00:40:04,661 --> 00:40:06,215
Do you think you're
something because

535
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,545
the kids call you big brother

536
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,655
at this pathetic place?

537
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,302
You feel proud?
Then just stay here.

538
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,613
Oh, it's cold.

539
00:40:22,785 --> 00:40:24,119
He thought

540
00:40:24,143 --> 00:40:27,619
his mother would be one in forty.

541
00:40:27,938 --> 00:40:29,939
Well, you see that old door there

542
00:40:30,651 --> 00:40:32,727
outside at the playground? Over there.

543
00:40:32,751 --> 00:40:35,128
They said he was abandoned there

544
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:38,089
with a letter saying,
"I'll be back to get you."

545
00:40:38,307 --> 00:40:41,300
That's the reason why he's so grumpy
so please cut him some slack.

546
00:40:51,847 --> 00:40:53,698
Jiyoung was working.

547
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,066
Yeah, she came back.

548
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,984
Becoming a singer was
never gonna happen.

549
00:41:02,012 --> 00:41:04,492
I liked her voice though.

550
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:07,360
3 to 1.

551
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:16,212
Well

552
00:41:16,896 --> 00:41:18,841
we all settle down here.

553
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:24,597
But it looks fun.

554
00:41:25,256 --> 00:41:27,441
- Yeah?
- 4 to 1.

555
00:41:30,378 --> 00:41:31,645
Fun?

556
00:41:36,218 --> 00:41:39,112
It's more fun than
being alone I suppose.

557
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,202
Still.

558
00:41:45,608 --> 00:41:49,750
You should go far away, far.

559
00:41:53,508 --> 00:41:54,922
Far away, where?

560
00:41:55,157 --> 00:41:56,157
Far.

561
00:41:57,672 --> 00:42:02,221
You're the hope
and the star for us kids.

562
00:42:04,618 --> 00:42:06,398
Where am I supposed to go?

563
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,828
Anywhere.

564
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:14,692
I think it'll be sad
if you do come back, really.

565
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:33,360
Good morning.

566
00:43:45,016 --> 00:43:47,584
Woosung, it's raining.

567
00:43:48,571 --> 00:43:49,586
It's raining.

568
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:52,339
This is a raindrop.

569
00:43:54,032 --> 00:43:55,383
It's the same thing.

570
00:44:08,439 --> 00:44:10,024
I'm sorry about yesterday.

571
00:44:12,009 --> 00:44:13,595
I was too harsh.

572
00:44:15,775 --> 00:44:17,404
I don't remember.

573
00:44:23,582 --> 00:44:25,500
I have these dreams sometimes

574
00:44:28,535 --> 00:44:30,214
it's raining...

575
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:36,091
And the rain washes me clean
from everything of my past.

576
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:43,519
But when I open my eyes,

577
00:44:44,911 --> 00:44:48,483
it's still pouring.

578
00:44:52,435 --> 00:44:54,281
And nothing has changed.

579
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,493
Wouldn't it be okay
if you had an umbrella?

580
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:01,616
An umbrella?

581
00:45:04,343 --> 00:45:06,877
Yes, a big umbrella.

582
00:45:09,194 --> 00:45:10,948
Something that two people can use...

583
00:45:20,626 --> 00:45:22,728
Stop it.

584
00:45:23,422 --> 00:45:27,649
I hope it's red
One with strawberries on it.

585
00:45:29,797 --> 00:45:32,487
When I was young,
my friend had something like that.

586
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,325
I was so jealous.

587
00:45:37,954 --> 00:45:39,078
You stole it?

588
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:42,697
Yeah, I took it and threw it away.

589
00:46:24,145 --> 00:46:26,171
But they're not blood related, are they?

590
00:46:26,363 --> 00:46:28,799
Yeah, everyone calls her mom, but...

591
00:46:28,907 --> 00:46:29,991
Everyone?

592
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:33,201
It woke me up
and my husband, too.

593
00:46:33,225 --> 00:46:35,306
We were so shocked
that we couldn't sleep.

594
00:46:35,348 --> 00:46:36,636
What's happening?

595
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,202
No, a police car came to them.

596
00:46:38,226 --> 00:46:40,520
- What's happened? Huh?
- Quiet, quiet.

597
00:46:41,748 --> 00:46:44,232
- Hey, come here.
- Hold on a second.

598
00:46:46,567 --> 00:46:48,361
No, that...

599
00:46:48,989 --> 00:46:52,911
I've never seen him before.
What's going on?

600
00:46:53,804 --> 00:46:57,037
He was killed in a hotel, then...

601
00:46:58,624 --> 00:46:59,791
Take a good look.

602
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:05,213
It's a picture captured by the hotel
CCTV. The girl lives here, right?

603
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:07,507
Yeji.

604
00:47:08,288 --> 00:47:09,969
Take the kids over there.

605
00:47:10,642 --> 00:47:12,555
Really, in front of the kids..

606
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:16,308
Hang on. Hey tall kid.

607
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,060
Tall kid, wait a minute.

608
00:47:19,341 --> 00:47:21,272
Here, candy.

609
00:47:24,399 --> 00:47:27,610
You can tell me anything.

610
00:47:28,666 --> 00:47:30,991
She lives here, right?

611
00:47:33,799 --> 00:47:35,245
I don't know.

612
00:47:43,526 --> 00:47:44,964
Ma'am,

613
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:48,968
This kid here is a baby, isn't he?

614
00:47:49,245 --> 00:47:53,493
I told her not to give birth.
How can a girl become a mother?

615
00:47:54,023 --> 00:47:55,578
What? What did you say?

616
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,415
I said I told her not to give birth!

617
00:47:59,439 --> 00:48:01,965
How can a girl like
that become a mother?

618
00:48:04,628 --> 00:48:06,204
Quiet! Quiet!

619
00:48:08,902 --> 00:48:11,742
Then is this... what you do here.

620
00:48:12,035 --> 00:48:13,411
Is this mother-like?

621
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,706
Well, I

622
00:48:17,028 --> 00:48:21,378
just took care of the kids
who didn't have a place to go.

623
00:48:23,044 --> 00:48:24,269
Murder?

624
00:48:27,922 --> 00:48:29,525
You mean prostitution?

625
00:48:34,163 --> 00:48:35,685
So you're saying

626
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:38,547
that she needed to run,
but the baby got in her way.

627
00:48:42,476 --> 00:48:47,073
Give me three days. I'm going to
make sure they sell within that time.

628
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:02,273
If it's murder,
the detective department will move?

629
00:49:02,297 --> 00:49:04,007
They're already on the move.

630
00:49:06,407 --> 00:49:07,678
We should set them up.

631
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:09,513
A set-up?

632
00:49:10,775 --> 00:49:11,807
As a buyer.

633
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:29,909
- The person you're calling...
- Shit...

634
00:49:29,972 --> 00:49:32,098
She's not picking up,
the one from Uljin.

635
00:49:32,353 --> 00:49:36,083
This is all because you sent her
the picture with weird eyebrows.

636
00:49:37,238 --> 00:49:38,420
What do you think of this?

637
00:49:39,012 --> 00:49:40,111
20 million won.

638
00:49:41,073 --> 00:49:42,652
Twice the market price...

639
00:49:43,617 --> 00:49:44,778
Do you want to meet them?

640
00:49:44,802 --> 00:49:46,219
Huh? Who?

641
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,055
I think it's the owner of the building.

642
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:51,851
How old is the woman?

643
00:49:52,545 --> 00:49:53,728
36.

644
00:49:53,753 --> 00:49:56,230
- Why?
- You want someone younger?

645
00:49:57,451 --> 00:49:59,025
No, it's not that.

646
00:50:01,685 --> 00:50:03,696
I have a bad feeling about this though.

647
00:50:07,794 --> 00:50:11,028
Isn't this too cheap?

648
00:50:13,067 --> 00:50:14,346
10 million?

649
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,946
The market price for the baby.

650
00:50:20,358 --> 00:50:22,485
A girl baby only costs 8 million won.

651
00:50:22,509 --> 00:50:24,344
Miss - Yeah?

652
00:50:25,411 --> 00:50:27,086
Using bait to provoke crime...

653
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,087
Two million won.

654
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:30,283
- Isn't that against the law?
- What's the difference?

655
00:50:30,308 --> 00:50:31,648
This is pissing me off.

656
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,605
What did you say?

657
00:50:36,217 --> 00:50:40,394
I've learned that it's not even taken
as evidence in a trial.

658
00:50:44,014 --> 00:50:46,174
They had intentions
to commit the crime from the start.

659
00:50:46,586 --> 00:50:48,666
This isn't crime induction.

660
00:50:50,703 --> 00:50:52,120
It's giving them an opportunity.

661
00:50:53,071 --> 00:50:54,214
Opportunity...

662
00:50:56,631 --> 00:50:59,526
<i>Oh, Bro Socrates...</i>

663
00:50:59,582 --> 00:51:02,510
Hey, if we get a deal there, you know...

664
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:06,097
Do you want to go to that place
when we get back to Busan?

665
00:51:06,924 --> 00:51:08,808
Are you asking to go see Jennifer?

666
00:51:09,394 --> 00:51:10,651
No, you can go on your own.

667
00:51:10,762 --> 00:51:13,688
- I'm not interested in those places.
- Keep it down, you punk...

668
00:51:13,847 --> 00:51:17,651
You're good at
talking nonsense even in this situation.

669
00:51:18,014 --> 00:51:20,821
Just to relax the situation.

670
00:51:21,206 --> 00:51:23,883
Even in the military,
before the soldiers go to training.

671
00:51:23,907 --> 00:51:26,679
You didn't even go to the military
because you were in jail.

672
00:51:26,703 --> 00:51:27,722
You didn't go either.

673
00:51:27,746 --> 00:51:29,747
You exempted for
being from an orphanage.

674
00:51:30,262 --> 00:51:32,875
I'm on the same level
as gold medalists.

675
00:51:33,949 --> 00:51:37,893
Why is love like this again?

676
00:51:49,287 --> 00:51:50,436
What's wrong?

677
00:51:55,169 --> 00:51:57,090
Why would you pull over here?

678
00:51:59,168 --> 00:52:00,714
I think I'm gonna pee.

679
00:52:01,912 --> 00:52:03,548
I'm really going to pee.

680
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:06,202
This kid...

681
00:52:17,658 --> 00:52:21,136
I told you.
I have a bad feeling about this.

682
00:52:22,266 --> 00:52:23,764
That hunch was this?

683
00:52:33,994 --> 00:52:37,320
Car was shaking so much
that I almost peed a little bit.

684
00:52:42,283 --> 00:52:43,576
This car stinks.

685
00:52:46,603 --> 00:52:49,323
Look at this kid talking like this
No one told you to get in the car.

686
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:53,063
Sir, can you take me with you?

687
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:56,215
No, everyone will be worried.

688
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,426
I'll give you some money,
you take the bus home by yourself.

689
00:52:59,535 --> 00:53:00,552
No.

690
00:53:04,738 --> 00:53:07,519
Why are you trying to
interrupt our family trip?

691
00:53:08,027 --> 00:53:10,355
I already know.
You're not a family.

692
00:53:10,505 --> 00:53:12,232
You're trying to sell Woosung.

693
00:53:13,722 --> 00:53:16,069
- How much did you hear?
- Everything.

694
00:53:21,973 --> 00:53:24,977
Please be careful.
I'll put this here.

695
00:53:26,091 --> 00:53:28,996
The important thing
is to not say negative things like,

696
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:31,580
"The baby doesn't have thick hair",
or, "His eyes are too small."

697
00:53:31,706 --> 00:53:34,483
And don't ask the mother
about the baby's biological father.

698
00:53:34,507 --> 00:53:36,369
- There must be something going on.
- Okay,

699
00:53:37,316 --> 00:53:39,679
- Have some coffee.
- Yes, thank you.

700
00:53:39,871 --> 00:53:41,222
Yes, thank you.

701
00:53:43,311 --> 00:53:45,768
Do they look like building owners?

702
00:53:47,628 --> 00:53:49,565
Aren't you a bit young?

703
00:53:50,508 --> 00:53:51,591
I'm sorry.

704
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:54,588
No, you don't need to apologize.

705
00:53:54,612 --> 00:53:55,655
Oh, okay.

706
00:53:56,263 --> 00:53:58,907
So, you two are married

707
00:53:59,265 --> 00:54:00,893
but not officially registered.

708
00:54:02,007 --> 00:54:04,179
That's why official adoption
is not an option for you.

709
00:54:04,204 --> 00:54:06,249
- Okay.
- Yes.

710
00:54:07,898 --> 00:54:10,653
And let's say your
sperm count is a bit low.

711
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,151
Me?

712
00:54:15,407 --> 00:54:17,839
Just give them the money
quickly and do it naturally.

713
00:54:17,864 --> 00:54:19,998
Got it. Your sperm count
is low and speak naturally...

714
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:23,060
Not enough sperm count
and money quickly...

715
00:54:23,111 --> 00:54:27,038
Then, let's practice our line.

716
00:54:27,062 --> 00:54:28,230
Yes, okay.

717
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:32,693
And this is the money we've prepared.

718
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,901
It's already been 5 years since
we started the infertility treatment.

719
00:54:39,245 --> 00:54:41,745
And we're exhausted from waiting.

720
00:54:42,354 --> 00:54:46,398
Hey detective, how about we mention
the de facto marriage story here?

721
00:54:46,422 --> 00:54:47,969
Since our marriage is not legal,

722
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,001
legal adoption is not easy,
something like that...

723
00:54:50,026 --> 00:54:51,402
Okay, let's go with that.

724
00:54:51,715 --> 00:54:52,715
Thank you.

725
00:54:55,442 --> 00:54:59,014
We will cherish him
like our actual child.

726
00:55:01,513 --> 00:55:04,330
Should we take out
the "actual" from that sentence?

727
00:55:04,354 --> 00:55:05,562
Should I take out "actual"?

728
00:55:05,943 --> 00:55:07,669
Oh, okay, minus the "actual", right.

729
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:10,303
Let's really cherish our children
No...

730
00:55:10,327 --> 00:55:12,615
We will cherish our children...

731
00:55:13,389 --> 00:55:14,568
- What did I say?
- Cherish.

732
00:55:14,592 --> 00:55:15,592
Oh, right.

733
00:55:15,794 --> 00:55:18,309
We will cherish

734
00:55:18,397 --> 00:55:20,481
the baby

735
00:55:21,046 --> 00:55:23,581
like our very own.

736
00:55:31,497 --> 00:55:36,427
<i>Jin jin ja ra, Ji ri ji ri ja.
Jin jin ja ra, Ji ri ji ri ja.</i>

737
00:55:36,451 --> 00:55:38,681
Jin jin ja ra, Ji ri ji ri ja.

738
00:55:38,983 --> 00:55:41,559
Oh, can I call this car Hae Jin-ho?

739
00:55:42,124 --> 00:55:43,997
Yeah, suit yourself.

740
00:55:44,021 --> 00:55:45,188
Yes!

741
00:55:45,672 --> 00:55:49,192
But Jennifer? Who's Jennifer?

742
00:55:50,086 --> 00:55:51,773
That's Dong-soo's girlfriend.

743
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:56,425
Hey, what does it say here?

744
00:55:56,449 --> 00:55:57,469
- Oh, this?
- Yes.

745
00:55:57,493 --> 00:55:58,633
Hae-jin.

746
00:55:58,672 --> 00:56:01,025
It's my name.
The pastor gave it to me.

747
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:05,543
You must really like your name.

748
00:56:05,651 --> 00:56:06,919
No.

749
00:56:07,181 --> 00:56:09,922
This is the only way to not get it
stolen at the orphanage.

750
00:56:10,106 --> 00:56:13,780
Thieves steal everything
even if you write your name on it.

751
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:16,055
- <i>9388, pull over to the right.</i>
- Right?

752
00:56:18,644 --> 00:56:20,786
<i>9388, pull over to the right.</i>

753
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:23,521
What? I didn't even speed up.

754
00:56:23,796 --> 00:56:26,966
Damn, huh?

755
00:56:32,449 --> 00:56:33,907
You're the wife...

756
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:38,346
So, let's say that you are
our store employees and are a couple.

757
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:40,372
No, we don't have to be a couple.

758
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:41,410
I don't like it either.

759
00:56:41,435 --> 00:56:43,455
Then let's call you a relative.
A distant relative.

760
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,260
- Got it?
- What? Second cousin? Eighth?

761
00:56:45,285 --> 00:56:46,441
- That's not...
- Hello.

762
00:56:46,466 --> 00:56:47,487
Good day, sir.

763
00:56:47,512 --> 00:56:48,555
Your license please.

764
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:49,769
Sure.

765
00:56:50,122 --> 00:56:52,886
But I wasn't speeding...

766
00:56:53,872 --> 00:56:55,263
Mr. Ha Jin-young.

767
00:56:55,825 --> 00:56:57,409
Your trunk door is open.

768
00:56:57,433 --> 00:57:00,464
You'll cause a huge accident
if things were too fall out

769
00:57:00,722 --> 00:57:01,771
I'm sorry.

770
00:57:07,397 --> 00:57:08,986
Are you all going somewhere?

771
00:57:09,082 --> 00:57:10,131
Yes.

772
00:57:10,155 --> 00:57:12,341
We're going to Lotte World
to ride the Ferris wheel.

773
00:57:12,365 --> 00:57:13,865
Wow, you're going far, aren't you?

774
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:15,385
Yes, we're going on a family trip.

775
00:57:15,409 --> 00:57:17,597
But there's no Ferris wheel there.

776
00:57:17,621 --> 00:57:18,705
Really?

777
00:57:19,617 --> 00:57:21,500
If you want to ride a Ferris wheel,

778
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:22,959
you have to go to Wolmido.

779
00:57:23,318 --> 00:57:25,521
Shall we go to Wolmido then?

780
00:57:25,545 --> 00:57:26,670
If you have time, - Yes.

781
00:57:26,725 --> 00:57:29,148
Ask your dad for a ride
on the cruise ship.

782
00:57:29,173 --> 00:57:31,966
- Yeah!
- I'm a little weak on boats.

783
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:33,388
I get motion sickness...

784
00:57:34,248 --> 00:57:35,992
- Do you run a laundry?
- Yes.

785
00:57:36,016 --> 00:57:38,236
I recently got this shirt
back from a dry cleaners.

786
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,187
It got all shriveled up.
What's wrong with this?

787
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,133
This needs to be dry cleaned
but it looks like they just washed it.

788
00:57:44,157 --> 00:57:45,264
Oh, really?

789
00:57:45,289 --> 00:57:47,805
There are so many amateurs
in dry cleaning these days.

790
00:57:47,887 --> 00:57:49,556
- Boss...
- You have to pay attention.

791
00:57:49,581 --> 00:57:51,017
- Make sure to clean this...
- Boss!

792
00:57:51,042 --> 00:57:52,705
- What?
- I think we should go...

793
00:57:52,736 --> 00:57:54,549
- Yeah, we have to...
- Your license, yes.

794
00:57:54,574 --> 00:57:55,741
Yes, thank you.

795
00:57:55,766 --> 00:57:57,439
You have to dry clean it next time.

796
00:57:57,463 --> 00:57:58,580
- All right.
- Okay.

797
00:57:58,605 --> 00:57:59,855
- Have a good time.
- Yes.

798
00:58:01,823 --> 00:58:03,625
- To Wolmido.
- Okay.

799
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:18,287
- Oh, my. Hello.
- Oh, yes.

800
00:58:18,311 --> 00:58:20,247
I'm sorry I'm late.
Did you wait long?

801
00:58:20,271 --> 00:58:21,332
- Not at all.
- No.

802
00:58:21,357 --> 00:58:22,416
We just got here.

803
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,528
- I see.
- Yes.

804
00:58:23,553 --> 00:58:25,086
I'm Ha Sang-hyun.
Are you Song Ji-chul?

805
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:26,379
Yes, that's correct.

806
00:58:26,403 --> 00:58:28,530
- Is he Woosung?
- Yes, yes.

807
00:58:29,528 --> 00:58:31,746
- Are you his mother?
- Yes.

808
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:34,327
Could I please hold the baby?

809
00:58:35,717 --> 00:58:37,512
Yes, go ahead.

810
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,824
I touched him.
I'm touching him, honey.

811
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:45,917
His facial features are so clear now.

812
00:58:45,941 --> 00:58:46,941
- Yes.
- Yes.

813
00:58:49,255 --> 00:58:51,262
You're really
going to raise him properly, right?

814
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:54,743
Of course, we will really cherish him.

815
00:58:54,767 --> 00:58:58,605
Are you going to cherish him the
same way even if your own child is born?

816
00:58:59,047 --> 00:59:00,106
Of course.

817
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,617
- You're serious?
- That's enough.

818
00:59:01,642 --> 00:59:03,961
- I should pay, huh?
- Yeah, this is really happening.

819
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,431
Give them the money...

820
00:59:05,497 --> 00:59:08,149
- Even his eyebrows are now...
- And your infertility treatment?

821
00:59:08,842 --> 00:59:11,267
We've already been
doing it for 5 years, so…

822
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:13,763
- Both of us.
- Both of us have gotten tired of it.

823
00:59:13,787 --> 00:59:14,930
- Right.
- So that's why we…

824
00:59:14,954 --> 00:59:17,194
We're not officially married, so...

825
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:18,460
Honey.

826
00:59:18,809 --> 00:59:20,578
Have you tested for AMH?

827
00:59:21,617 --> 00:59:23,909
Or HSG?

828
00:59:25,157 --> 00:59:27,219
- Yeah, well, that one...
- Yes.

829
00:59:28,494 --> 00:59:30,514
I guess Letrozole didn't work.

830
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:34,267
Yes. Letrozole had such
serious side effects, so I...

831
00:59:34,418 --> 00:59:38,021
It's so hard for her to watch me like
that, so I intend to stop taking it now.

832
00:59:39,071 --> 00:59:41,317
Letrozole is an
ovulation-inducing product.

833
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:44,862
Of course it won't
work if you take that.

834
00:59:46,557 --> 00:59:48,741
I know, right? So, my sperm...

835
00:59:48,861 --> 00:59:50,670
We're talking about
ovulation-inducing drugs.

836
00:59:50,695 --> 00:59:52,038
Why are you bringing up sperm?

837
00:59:52,063 --> 00:59:53,432
Here, here.
Take this, take this.

838
01:00:10,081 --> 01:00:12,536
That's just for resale, right?

839
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,912
I recognized it right away.

840
01:00:13,936 --> 01:00:15,614
Do you know about
reselling medication?

841
01:00:15,639 --> 01:00:17,006
Haejin, don't open that window.

842
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,076
- Someone paid them to do it.
- Don't touch me.

843
01:00:19,708 --> 01:00:22,071
But how do you know
so much about infertility treatment?

844
01:00:22,095 --> 01:00:23,692
Wow, there's a lot of foam.

845
01:00:24,012 --> 01:00:27,865
No, something similar
happened last year, hyung was scammed.

846
01:00:27,897 --> 01:00:30,526
I said don't touch me.
I'm just, just looking.

847
01:00:30,803 --> 01:00:32,007
If we had given up on him,

848
01:00:32,031 --> 01:00:34,517
Woosung would have gone
to another country by now...

849
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:35,679
Hey!

850
01:00:35,704 --> 01:00:37,330
Hey, hey, close it, close it, you punk!

851
01:00:43,794 --> 01:00:45,886
Close it, you punk!
Hey, hey, close it. Hurry up!

852
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:14,333
He's going to catch a cold.

853
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:16,228
Let's take care of what's in the back.

854
01:01:16,252 --> 01:01:17,629
Stop it.

855
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,073
But that driver's
license I saw earlier...

856
01:01:28,097 --> 01:01:29,140
Yeah?

857
01:01:29,249 --> 01:01:30,725
Who's Ha Jin-young?

858
01:01:31,794 --> 01:01:35,065
Sanghyun is my nickname
From when I was in the military.

859
01:01:35,505 --> 01:01:38,871
Right so, hyung, you know you didn't go
to the military, don't you? Right?

860
01:01:39,255 --> 01:01:40,792
Figure it out, punk.

861
01:01:40,816 --> 01:01:42,066
What about you?

862
01:01:42,363 --> 01:01:45,956
"I have a weak stomach,
so I get motion sickness"?

863
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:47,564
Wasn't that entirely real?

864
01:01:47,738 --> 01:01:50,500
What do you mean it was real?
It was completely ridiculous.

865
01:01:50,524 --> 01:01:51,916
Haejin was better.

866
01:01:52,637 --> 01:01:54,043
Idiot.

867
01:01:55,521 --> 01:01:57,583
Actually, the name Sang-hyun...

868
01:01:57,607 --> 01:02:01,112
I was going to give it to
my son when he was born.

869
01:02:01,847 --> 01:02:03,012
Really?

870
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:04,959
Yeah.

871
01:02:08,021 --> 01:02:10,202
It's not really a funny
story or anything, huh?

872
01:02:16,529 --> 01:02:17,823
So-young...

873
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:19,818
Huh?

874
01:02:20,354 --> 01:02:23,115
My real name is Moon So-young.

875
01:02:23,247 --> 01:02:24,343
Then Sun-ah is...

876
01:02:24,367 --> 01:02:28,052
Just a really annoying
lady who lives next door.

877
01:02:29,514 --> 01:02:32,570
What a bunch of liars, am I right?

878
01:03:05,822 --> 01:03:07,705
I mean, since this happened...

879
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:10,722
Should we use it?

880
01:03:11,793 --> 01:03:12,944
A person's death.

881
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:49,500
Hello.

882
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,587
Who's this?

883
01:03:56,309 --> 01:03:58,092
Hand over the baby.

884
01:03:59,271 --> 01:04:03,014
You paid all the money to that mother.

885
01:04:03,568 --> 01:04:04,808
5 million won.

886
01:04:07,521 --> 01:04:10,022
You were supposed to erase
that baby on that condition.

887
01:04:11,022 --> 01:04:13,025
Why did you give birth to that baby?

888
01:04:26,359 --> 01:04:30,127
Moon So-young, we're the police.

889
01:04:30,524 --> 01:04:32,213
Can I talk with you for a moment?

890
01:05:12,034 --> 01:05:13,131
You're here?

891
01:05:13,239 --> 01:05:14,340
You're here?

892
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:16,059
Took you a while.

893
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:18,324
We're making a three-person work
responsibility schedule.

894
01:05:18,683 --> 01:05:20,096
A work responsibility schedule?

895
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,187
A schedule for feeding milk to Woosung.

896
01:05:23,745 --> 01:05:25,561
Did something good happen?

897
01:05:25,765 --> 01:05:26,783
Yes.

898
01:05:27,184 --> 01:05:29,024
I have a guest in Seoul.

899
01:05:29,739 --> 01:05:31,364
They're giving me 30 million won.

900
01:05:33,389 --> 01:05:36,240
Oh, that's amazing.

901
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:39,345
Are you going to give him a bath now?

902
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:41,020
Oh, no.

903
01:05:41,721 --> 01:05:45,822
He has poop on his butt,
and this hyung is really bad at this.

904
01:05:46,316 --> 01:05:50,608
Okay, two-hour shifts from 10 p.m.

905
01:05:50,632 --> 01:05:52,591
until 6 a.m., how about that?

906
01:05:53,929 --> 01:05:56,762
"Sang, Dong, So, Dong, Sang..."

907
01:05:57,037 --> 01:06:00,265
Wait, this is a schedule where
you sleep well for 6 hours, ya know.

908
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:03,435
No, rather than sleeping well…
can't I do this?

909
01:06:04,152 --> 01:06:06,415
- That's a bit too much.
- Oh, really?

910
01:06:06,439 --> 01:06:07,918
- I want to do it.
- What?

911
01:06:07,942 --> 01:06:09,544
- Feeding him powdered milk.
- Really?

912
01:06:09,568 --> 01:06:12,195
- Then from 4am to 6am?
- Yes.

913
01:06:13,334 --> 01:06:16,919
Then, from 10pm to 12pm.

914
01:06:16,966 --> 01:06:19,540
You can't take your
shift out and give it away.

915
01:06:22,173 --> 01:06:24,133
Don't you think she seems
easy to cooperate with?

916
01:06:26,151 --> 01:06:27,628
You're right.

917
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:32,086
Did the commutation
of the sentence reduction work?

918
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:34,885
No, I don't think so.

919
01:06:35,296 --> 01:06:37,262
- <i>Give it to me.</i>
- Then what?

920
01:06:37,573 --> 01:06:39,024
<i>Hey, then...</i>

921
01:06:39,324 --> 01:06:41,062
I don't know, well, I...

922
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:44,617
I don't know, but...

923
01:06:44,641 --> 01:06:46,147
<i>Just do it all.</i>

924
01:06:46,276 --> 01:06:48,609
I don't think it's a commutation.

925
01:06:48,736 --> 01:06:49,985
<i>I want to take a bath, too.</i>

926
01:06:50,883 --> 01:06:52,881
You wash yourself.

927
01:06:52,905 --> 01:06:54,241
Geez, I don't want to.

928
01:07:01,028 --> 01:07:03,542
How is he? Did you feed him?

929
01:07:03,984 --> 01:07:05,919
No, he threw up again.

930
01:07:08,738 --> 01:07:11,676
Are you sure you cooled it down?
Isn't it because it's too hot?

931
01:07:14,078 --> 01:07:15,304
It was fine.

932
01:07:15,786 --> 01:07:17,890
Is it because he got wet yesterday?

933
01:07:19,044 --> 01:07:20,476
I'm sorry, Woosung.

934
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:22,979
No, it's not your fault.

935
01:07:23,465 --> 01:07:25,314
No, I don't think it's just a cold...

936
01:07:26,754 --> 01:07:29,042
Have you ever done it before?

937
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:33,600
We have to take him
to the hospital, hyung.

938
01:07:35,458 --> 01:07:39,109
We can't do that.
We might get caught.

939
01:07:52,994 --> 01:07:57,056
It's not like meningitis, right?

940
01:07:57,625 --> 01:07:59,935
Since yesterday,
his fever suddenly went up...

941
01:08:01,837 --> 01:08:03,647
Will he get better?

942
01:08:04,867 --> 01:08:06,692
What if he dies?

943
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:11,281
Is he your little brother?

944
01:08:13,721 --> 01:08:14,744
Yes.

945
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,832
He'll be fine. He won't die.

946
01:08:19,713 --> 01:08:21,556
It looks like a cold,

947
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:23,255
but make sure that you
keep an eye on him

948
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:24,953
so that it doesn't
spread into pneumonia.

949
01:08:24,977 --> 01:08:27,991
For now, I'll give you a fever reducer.

950
01:08:28,015 --> 01:08:31,345
If his fever doesn't go down,
come back tomorrow.

951
01:08:33,183 --> 01:08:35,474
Woosung, that's great.

952
01:08:37,542 --> 01:08:42,041
What's sadder than love

953
01:08:42,065 --> 01:08:44,745
is affection.

954
01:08:44,931 --> 01:08:46,798
Will the baby be okay?

955
01:08:49,239 --> 01:08:50,907
Everyone's making a fuss...

956
01:08:51,769 --> 01:08:54,540
Anyway, It's just a cold.

957
01:08:54,619 --> 01:08:56,663
Well, that's true, but...

958
01:08:57,819 --> 01:09:00,909
But it'll be a big problem
if he doesn't get better soon.

959
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:05,039
Are you afraid they
won't be able to sell him?

960
01:09:10,038 --> 01:09:13,931
Well, if they can't sell him,
we can't catch them in the act.

961
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:17,857
I thought since you're in the Department
for Women and Adolescents…

962
01:09:17,881 --> 01:09:20,015
I thought you should've
cast your net a little

963
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:21,982
higher up the river
than the detectives.

964
01:09:24,509 --> 01:09:25,652
Higher up the river?

965
01:09:26,835 --> 01:09:29,883
Shouldn't you have saved her
first before she abandoned the baby?

966
01:09:29,907 --> 01:09:32,101
That's the Department
of Health's job, okay?

967
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:34,603
Before she throws him away,
it's Department of Health's case.

968
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:36,336
After she abandons
him, it's the police's.

969
01:09:37,052 --> 01:09:38,153
Seriously.

970
01:09:41,009 --> 01:09:43,589
Team leader,
why are you so cold to that woman?

971
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:52,056
She's irresponsible.

972
01:09:54,455 --> 01:09:56,978
Because she gave birth
to him and threw him away,

973
01:09:58,517 --> 01:10:02,734
but we can't conclude
that she's the same.

974
01:10:05,181 --> 01:10:08,073
Do you understand how a mother
feels about abandoning her child?

975
01:10:11,346 --> 01:10:12,786
I guess I can't.

976
01:10:22,049 --> 01:10:25,192
He can't do this.
This isn't a playground.

977
01:10:25,216 --> 01:10:27,510
Right, yes, this is...

978
01:10:28,036 --> 01:10:30,263
- Are you his father?
- Oh, yes...

979
01:10:31,865 --> 01:10:33,619
- There are a lot of patients here…
- Okay.

980
01:10:33,643 --> 01:10:35,096
- Please be careful.
- Yes, okay.

981
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,518
Are you Woosung's father?

982
01:10:37,396 --> 01:10:38,814
Yeah, oh...

983
01:10:39,761 --> 01:10:40,775
Yes.

984
01:10:40,967 --> 01:10:42,682
What's his resident registration number?

985
01:10:42,706 --> 01:10:43,712
- Got it?
- Yes.

986
01:10:44,862 --> 01:10:46,039
Okay.

987
01:10:46,064 --> 01:10:47,766
Actually, he's only one month old so...

988
01:10:48,949 --> 01:10:51,760
- One month?
- Everyone was surprised.

989
01:10:53,144 --> 01:10:55,361
Is it because of that
powdered milk? That...

990
01:10:55,693 --> 01:10:57,186
That American brand... What was it?

991
01:10:57,210 --> 01:10:58,461
Similac...

992
01:10:59,404 --> 01:11:01,399
Similac.

993
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:03,413
- His grandmother is in the countryside.
- Yes.

994
01:11:03,437 --> 01:11:05,593
- I wonder how many she sent me...
- I know.

995
01:11:05,763 --> 01:11:07,887
She must be so happy
to have her first grandchild.

996
01:11:09,208 --> 01:11:11,407
Okay, then, Woosung's
father, please come this way...

997
01:11:12,164 --> 01:11:13,432
Oh, okay.

998
01:11:16,177 --> 01:11:19,316
Gosh, that kid,
he plays soccer all the time...

999
01:11:19,904 --> 01:11:23,498
That's why the owner always squeaks.

1000
01:11:23,522 --> 01:11:25,601
Jin jin ja ra, Jiri jiri ja.

1001
01:11:25,625 --> 01:11:28,185
- Jin jin ja ra, Jiri jiri ja.
- What's wrong with him and how...

1002
01:11:31,968 --> 01:11:33,665
Thank you for taking care of Woosung.

1003
01:11:34,702 --> 01:11:38,753
Well, babies get fever and they grow up.

1004
01:11:40,202 --> 01:11:42,591
If I were alone,
I wouldn't be able to do anything.

1005
01:11:43,625 --> 01:11:47,096
You don't have to do it all by yourself.

1006
01:11:51,813 --> 01:11:54,384
The father

1007
01:11:55,328 --> 01:11:56,479
of Woosung?

1008
01:11:57,131 --> 01:11:58,817
I was against it from the beginning.

1009
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:04,072
I see...

1010
01:12:33,542 --> 01:12:36,693
She probably ran away with the baby.

1011
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:39,194
Find him and bring him back.

1012
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:41,988
The girl?

1013
01:12:42,832 --> 01:12:43,948
The baby.

1014
01:12:46,177 --> 01:12:48,120
What are you going to do with the baby?

1015
01:12:52,404 --> 01:12:53,704
I'm going to raise him.

1016
01:12:54,442 --> 01:12:55,442
I will.

1017
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:57,963
Because he's my husband's child.

1018
01:13:08,171 --> 01:13:11,520
It's fully automatic?
Are you kidding me?

1019
01:13:12,764 --> 01:13:14,773
How do you do this?

1020
01:13:27,493 --> 01:13:28,831
Oh, Taeho.

1021
01:13:29,165 --> 01:13:32,751
Uh, I'm sorry,
but I'll rush the money.

1022
01:13:36,884 --> 01:13:38,007
What?

1023
01:13:38,564 --> 01:13:40,802
Baby? Who, who?

1024
01:13:45,025 --> 01:13:46,641
Woosung's father?

1025
01:13:47,994 --> 01:13:49,185
How much?

1026
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,597
Four thousand?

1027
01:13:57,963 --> 01:13:59,780
He's totally asleep.

1028
01:14:01,674 --> 01:14:03,095
I guess he's tired.

1029
01:14:03,831 --> 01:14:06,455
You've been worrying about him all day.

1030
01:14:10,198 --> 01:14:12,087
He looks like Siwoo.

1031
01:14:14,254 --> 01:14:16,923
These types don't
sell well and get left behind.

1032
01:14:19,543 --> 01:14:22,221
Didn't you want to be adopted?

1033
01:14:25,098 --> 01:14:27,143
I really liked it there.

1034
01:14:27,747 --> 01:14:29,979
That's why I refused
to talk about adoption.

1035
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:33,608
Because your mom said she'd pick you up?

1036
01:14:37,575 --> 01:14:39,403
What else did hyung tell you?

1037
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:43,620
Um, he told me about the letter.

1038
01:14:47,053 --> 01:14:49,834
'Cause I never thought I'd be abandoned.

1039
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:58,552
He fell asleep.

1040
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:02,973
Do you want to try?

1041
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:05,684
Please just do me a favor.

1042
01:15:08,054 --> 01:15:10,565
Put his chin on your shoulder.

1043
01:15:10,674 --> 01:15:12,359
I know. I know.

1044
01:15:13,235 --> 01:15:15,570
- No, a little higher.
- I said I know.

1045
01:15:16,501 --> 01:15:18,740
- Hey, that's too weak...
- Oh, you're too loud, just...

1046
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:26,040
You're not taking care
of Woosung on purpose, are you?

1047
01:15:26,502 --> 01:15:27,645
Huh?

1048
01:15:30,778 --> 01:15:32,698
I'm afraid you won't be
able to part ways later.

1049
01:15:38,994 --> 01:15:40,263
Why are you laughing?

1050
01:15:41,517 --> 01:15:44,851
It's perfect for girls.

1051
01:15:48,046 --> 01:15:50,232
Why are you saying
the same thing as hyung?

1052
01:16:07,568 --> 01:16:08,669
Where are you going?

1053
01:16:08,944 --> 01:16:10,004
Convenience store.

1054
01:16:10,249 --> 01:16:11,422
Do you want me to go instead?

1055
01:16:11,759 --> 01:16:15,524
There are things that
women can't ask others to do.

1056
01:16:16,459 --> 01:16:19,472
Bring an umbrella in case it rains.

1057
01:16:20,639 --> 01:16:22,309
Come and pick me up if it rains.

1058
01:16:24,857 --> 01:16:26,104
With an umbrella.

1059
01:16:30,415 --> 01:16:31,577
I don't want to.

1060
01:16:32,679 --> 01:16:34,614
I'll be back.

1061
01:16:42,521 --> 01:16:44,665
Where did you meet that mother?

1062
01:16:46,469 --> 01:16:49,254
I was sleeping on Songdo beach
after running away from home,

1063
01:16:49,523 --> 01:16:51,298
and she told me to come if I was hungry.

1064
01:16:53,507 --> 01:16:56,193
And then you were
forced to prostitute yourself?

1065
01:17:00,851 --> 01:17:02,917
Do you pity me?

1066
01:17:05,109 --> 01:17:08,521
- No, that's not what I meant...
- I did it even before I met his mom.

1067
01:17:09,812 --> 01:17:12,650
Then, why did you kill him?

1068
01:17:14,401 --> 01:17:15,794
It's because of, well

1069
01:17:16,595 --> 01:17:17,697
fit of rage?

1070
01:17:19,079 --> 01:17:20,283
In a fit of rage?

1071
01:17:21,063 --> 01:17:24,292
He's telling me to lick it before I
take a shower, that crazy bastard...

1072
01:17:25,955 --> 01:17:29,109
So the first other person...
i mean, was it self-defense or...

1073
01:17:29,133 --> 01:17:32,094
If you want to know the list of
the other customers, I can tell you.

1074
01:17:34,824 --> 01:17:37,652
That's enough.
All I want to know is...

1075
01:17:37,676 --> 01:17:40,059
Is this an interrogation? Or a sermon?

1076
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:43,251
Like I said, the baby
will be sold, so don't worry.

1077
01:17:44,645 --> 01:17:48,067
My team leader
and I want to help you...

1078
01:17:52,169 --> 01:17:54,107
Have you ever abandoned a child?

1079
01:17:54,494 --> 01:17:56,250
Have you ever killed a man?

1080
01:17:56,942 --> 01:18:00,539
Okay, then tell me,
because I don't understand.

1081
01:18:03,388 --> 01:18:06,671
Why did you throw him away
outside the church?

1082
01:18:12,279 --> 01:18:13,386
You saw that?

1083
01:18:17,787 --> 01:18:19,892
If you left him like that, he'd be dead.

1084
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:25,387
That's because
I didn't want to see him again.

1085
01:18:26,663 --> 01:18:28,863
Why did you give birth
to him if you couldn't raise him?

1086
01:18:29,261 --> 01:18:30,786
Are you saying I
should've aborted him?

1087
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:34,022
If you're thinking about the child,
don't you have that option?

1088
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:37,602
Is it lighter crime
to kill the child

1089
01:18:37,626 --> 01:18:39,382
before giving birth
than to throw it away

1090
01:18:40,172 --> 01:18:41,625
after giving birth?

1091
01:18:48,844 --> 01:18:49,922
Well...

1092
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:52,636
Since no one wants them,

1093
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:55,176
aren't babies more
unhappy when they're born?

1094
01:18:55,237 --> 01:18:57,505
You're saying I should've
killed him before he was born?

1095
01:18:57,530 --> 01:18:59,150
You talk like that
in front of Woosung?

1096
01:18:59,175 --> 01:19:01,373
What did you mean by throwing him away?

1097
01:19:38,887 --> 01:19:40,041
Yes.

1098
01:19:43,258 --> 01:19:44,801
Uh, you know,

1099
01:19:46,161 --> 01:19:50,073
can you get me some
clothes? My buttons fell off.

1100
01:19:51,575 --> 01:19:54,405
Yes, in Uljin.

1101
01:20:01,137 --> 01:20:02,320
Right?

1102
01:20:06,908 --> 01:20:08,760
No, it's okay.

1103
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:15,601
Look at this.
Hold on. Listen to this song.

1104
01:20:25,992 --> 01:20:29,633
Hello? Oh, can you hear
it? Do you remember this?

1105
01:20:29,657 --> 01:20:32,119
In the movie we watched together...

1106
01:20:33,033 --> 01:20:34,663
The one that came out...

1107
01:20:39,556 --> 01:20:40,961
That's right.

1108
01:20:42,931 --> 01:20:47,010
In reality, well,
that's not gonna happen.

1109
01:20:53,221 --> 01:20:55,328
Rice? What rice?

1110
01:20:55,352 --> 01:20:57,065
Oh, like in the wedding?

1111
01:20:57,791 --> 01:20:59,066
Yes.

1112
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:08,782
No, I don't think so.

1113
01:21:13,229 --> 01:21:14,371
Sorry.

1114
01:21:22,904 --> 01:21:24,167
It's just.

1115
01:21:36,241 --> 01:21:38,023
Poke it on the outside.

1116
01:21:38,896 --> 01:21:41,802
Look at the bottom
of the button like this.

1117
01:21:42,991 --> 01:21:46,490
If you spin it a few times,
if you spin it like this,

1118
01:21:46,709 --> 01:21:47,741
it's not coming off.

1119
01:21:47,928 --> 01:21:49,514
Wow, Dong-soo hyung,
how do you do that?

1120
01:21:49,538 --> 01:21:51,619
- Hae-jin, try this one, too.
- I want to do it, too.

1121
01:21:51,821 --> 01:21:53,089
I said try this one out, too.

1122
01:21:53,314 --> 01:21:54,916
No, I want to do this.

1123
01:22:00,013 --> 01:22:03,007
What kind of person are
you meeting tomorrow?

1124
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:05,635
Someone rich, of course.

1125
01:22:06,391 --> 01:22:08,949
With that 40 million won...

1126
01:22:08,973 --> 01:22:10,182
It's 3,000.

1127
01:22:10,315 --> 01:22:13,484
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's 3,000, 3,000.

1128
01:22:14,266 --> 01:22:16,839
Why? What kind of
person do you want it to be?

1129
01:22:17,883 --> 01:22:20,067
Someone as pretty as So-young.

1130
01:22:21,407 --> 01:22:24,781
Hey, Dong-soo, learn from him. Learn.

1131
01:22:25,384 --> 01:22:28,511
You shouldn't let
a man say such empty words, man.

1132
01:22:28,535 --> 01:22:31,329
Oh, I learned a lesson, Master.

1133
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:32,486
What?

1134
01:22:32,908 --> 01:22:34,374
I couldn't hear you that well.

1135
01:22:35,108 --> 01:22:37,264
In the past, it was said the
eldest son takes after

1136
01:22:37,289 --> 01:22:39,348
his mom and the eldest
daughter takes after her dad.

1137
01:22:39,373 --> 01:22:41,307
So our house is ruined.

1138
01:22:41,806 --> 01:22:43,933
It's okay. We don't live together.

1139
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:46,503
That's all superstition.

1140
01:22:46,705 --> 01:22:49,909
Oh, she's the eldest daughter.

1141
01:22:49,933 --> 01:22:50,979
Shut up.

1142
01:22:51,004 --> 01:22:53,968
Whenever I see pictures
of my mom, I get surprised.

1143
01:22:54,148 --> 01:22:55,381
I thought it was me.

1144
01:22:58,134 --> 01:23:00,129
The button was about to fall off.

1145
01:23:00,153 --> 01:23:01,988
Now, okay.

1146
01:23:07,187 --> 01:23:08,312
Where are you going?

1147
01:23:08,359 --> 01:23:09,708
To wash up.

1148
01:23:15,482 --> 01:23:16,962
Even he

1149
01:23:18,447 --> 01:23:20,074
doesn't know his parents' faces either.

1150
01:23:21,864 --> 01:23:23,494
Living without knowing...

1151
01:23:24,826 --> 01:23:26,973
There are cases like that.

1152
01:23:33,983 --> 01:23:38,234
It's better if Woosung
doesn't know my face.

1153
01:23:41,075 --> 01:23:42,386
Why do you think so?

1154
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:47,495
Because I'm a murderer.

1155
01:23:49,776 --> 01:23:50,961
Murder?

1156
01:23:52,233 --> 01:23:53,250
Yes.

1157
01:23:55,820 --> 01:23:57,129
Who'd you kill?

1158
01:23:59,867 --> 01:24:01,219
Woosung's biological father.

1159
01:24:06,236 --> 01:24:07,308
Why?

1160
01:24:15,714 --> 01:24:18,362
He shouldn't have been born like this.

1161
01:24:20,063 --> 01:24:21,668
I was going to take Woosung away.

1162
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:27,159
What?

1163
01:24:30,198 --> 01:24:33,294
His wife is probably after me by now.

1164
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:42,345
So if you're going to sell it properly,
you can leave me behind.

1165
01:24:52,505 --> 01:24:54,400
Uh, I'm out of the motel right now.

1166
01:24:55,583 --> 01:24:57,528
Okay, hold on.

1167
01:24:57,736 --> 01:24:59,420
Uh, wait.

1168
01:25:01,762 --> 01:25:03,685
Let me ask you something.

1169
01:25:04,062 --> 01:25:05,158
Hyung.

1170
01:25:08,928 --> 01:25:10,166
What are you doing here?

1171
01:25:10,841 --> 01:25:15,046
Well, what So young said yesterday
was on my mind, so I looked here.

1172
01:25:16,295 --> 01:25:17,425
This...

1173
01:25:17,533 --> 01:25:18,719
What's this?

1174
01:25:20,531 --> 01:25:23,682
Is this GPS?
Where did you find this?

1175
01:25:23,978 --> 01:25:25,350
Over here.

1176
01:25:28,445 --> 01:25:29,445
Is it the police?

1177
01:25:30,242 --> 01:25:33,303
The police don't use
old items like this these days.

1178
01:25:34,493 --> 01:25:37,655
That means they've been following us.

1179
01:25:38,097 --> 01:25:39,365
Don't you think so?

1180
01:25:39,545 --> 01:25:41,976
Woosung's paternal side.

1181
01:25:46,647 --> 01:25:47,850
I can't.

1182
01:25:47,874 --> 01:25:48,874
Can't what?

1183
01:25:49,485 --> 01:25:52,171
Hyung, you're thinking
of leaving So-young here.

1184
01:25:53,216 --> 01:25:54,651
Well...

1185
01:25:57,635 --> 01:26:01,580
This time, it's not money,
it's about convincing So young.

1186
01:26:02,681 --> 01:26:04,767
Let's find her a buyer like that.

1187
01:26:05,987 --> 01:26:09,773
Hey, man, money isn't everything.

1188
01:26:10,839 --> 01:26:12,108
Then that's a relief.

1189
01:26:13,854 --> 01:26:15,487
Then I'll take care of this myself.

1190
01:26:18,972 --> 01:26:20,075
What?

1191
01:26:21,659 --> 01:26:23,037
What are you doing now?

1192
01:26:48,154 --> 01:26:49,941
I know everything.

1193
01:26:50,381 --> 01:26:53,027
Woosung's dad is dead.

1194
01:26:54,124 --> 01:26:57,046
Who cares?
You just need to get paid.

1195
01:26:59,718 --> 01:27:03,038
I mean, who the hell is
trying to save Woosung?

1196
01:27:06,515 --> 01:27:07,815
A dead man's wife.

1197
01:27:08,694 --> 01:27:10,335
What is she going to
do after buying him?

1198
01:27:11,922 --> 01:27:13,539
She wanted to raise him.

1199
01:27:13,563 --> 01:27:16,344
Raise him?
Let's not talk nonsense.

1200
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:18,305
You're trying to sell
him out, aren't you?

1201
01:27:18,796 --> 01:27:21,750
You're going abroad, huh?
I will never sell him.

1202
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:24,962
Come out, mister. Come out.

1203
01:27:25,374 --> 01:27:26,748
Hey, hey.

1204
01:27:28,501 --> 01:27:29,775
Who the hell are you?

1205
01:27:30,884 --> 01:27:32,111
I see.

1206
01:27:33,181 --> 01:27:34,772
Are you from Woosung's father's side?

1207
01:27:34,888 --> 01:27:37,808
Shut up. Give me the kid. Hey, are
you not coming out? Come out! Come out!

1208
01:27:49,065 --> 01:27:51,239
Hey, hey, hey.

1209
01:27:53,650 --> 01:27:55,887
Hey, isn't he dead?

1210
01:27:57,381 --> 01:27:59,909
Hey, he's the son of
someone I know, you punk.

1211
01:28:00,468 --> 01:28:02,269
It's okay. He just passed out.

1212
01:28:07,698 --> 01:28:08,795
Let's do it together.

1213
01:28:27,715 --> 01:28:29,354
Where are they going now?

1214
01:28:29,587 --> 01:28:32,627
Oh, they're heading
south along this road.

1215
01:28:32,651 --> 01:28:34,834
I think we can
catch up with them in about 5km.

1216
01:28:35,084 --> 01:28:36,876
- Speed up a little bit.
- Okay.

1217
01:28:36,931 --> 01:28:38,015
I let my guard down.

1218
01:29:23,448 --> 01:29:24,482
Oh.

1219
01:29:26,229 --> 01:29:27,569
I had a dream.

1220
01:29:29,753 --> 01:29:32,449
Once, my daughter,

1221
01:29:33,268 --> 01:29:37,121
wife, and mom rode
this and went to Wolmido.

1222
01:29:38,691 --> 01:29:39,976
And then...

1223
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,250
That's a nice dream.

1224
01:29:41,692 --> 01:29:44,044
No, not really.

1225
01:29:50,645 --> 01:29:53,763
Why do you think she
showed it to us on purpose?

1226
01:29:54,664 --> 01:29:56,583
- Their destination?
- Yes.

1227
01:30:00,437 --> 01:30:02,606
I guess she wants us to follow them.

1228
01:30:03,571 --> 01:30:07,278
You mean not to lose Woosung?

1229
01:30:10,264 --> 01:30:12,200
I guess that's what she's thinking.

1230
01:30:27,311 --> 01:30:28,634
Are you gonna be okay?

1231
01:30:29,284 --> 01:30:30,677
It's on me.

1232
01:30:32,123 --> 01:30:33,253
That's not what I meant.

1233
01:30:36,876 --> 01:30:39,188
I'm just going by myself if I have to.

1234
01:30:41,422 --> 01:30:42,942
Even so, it's fine.

1235
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:46,220
As long as it's not
like installments or anything like that.

1236
01:30:47,938 --> 01:30:49,640
- So-young.
- Yes?

1237
01:30:51,594 --> 01:30:55,372
You put Woosung in the box.

1238
01:30:57,478 --> 01:31:02,212
I mean, were you
really going to pick him up again?

1239
01:31:09,337 --> 01:31:10,555
No.

1240
01:31:12,885 --> 01:31:14,308
I don't know.

1241
01:31:17,962 --> 01:31:19,313
But...

1242
01:31:21,502 --> 01:31:24,193
If we have met a little earlier...

1243
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:29,097
I wouldn't have had to throw him away.

1244
01:31:33,417 --> 01:31:35,033
It's not too late.

1245
01:31:36,636 --> 01:31:38,333
Huh? What was that?

1246
01:31:40,199 --> 01:31:41,461
Oh, nothing.

1247
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:50,153
So-young only has you, Mr. Sang-hyun.
You're too mean.

1248
01:31:50,942 --> 01:31:53,433
Really? Okay, touch the baton then.

1249
01:31:59,621 --> 01:32:01,598
What kind of man do you like, noon a?

1250
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:03,444
Huh?

1251
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:07,866
I'm not sure.

1252
01:32:08,872 --> 01:32:11,500
A guy who looks good
in overalls like you?

1253
01:32:15,366 --> 01:32:18,539
Hae-jin, that's a nice name.

1254
01:32:19,531 --> 01:32:21,130
I like your name.

1255
01:32:21,796 --> 01:32:23,799
That means heading to the sea, right?

1256
01:32:24,976 --> 01:32:29,038
When you grow up,
I'm sure you'll be working abroad.

1257
01:32:29,865 --> 01:32:31,813
In the Premier League?

1258
01:32:33,649 --> 01:32:34,686
That's right.

1259
01:32:37,461 --> 01:32:39,566
Who named Woosung?

1260
01:32:40,095 --> 01:32:41,301
I did.

1261
01:32:41,375 --> 01:32:42,691
Sounds wonderful.

1262
01:32:43,493 --> 01:32:45,822
What does Woosung mean?

1263
01:32:51,479 --> 01:32:53,665
Woo means wings,

1264
01:32:53,907 --> 01:32:55,181
Sung means star.

1265
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:58,349
It means I want him to go far away.

1266
01:32:58,791 --> 01:33:01,923
If Heajin is going to the sea,
then Woosung is over there,

1267
01:33:02,128 --> 01:33:04,718
beyond the sky going
to the stars, like this.

1268
01:33:05,212 --> 01:33:06,720
Just like an astronaut?

1269
01:33:07,573 --> 01:33:08,831
Or a pilot?

1270
01:33:10,538 --> 01:33:12,056
You two look like siblings.

1271
01:33:38,865 --> 01:33:40,060
Oh, yes, hello?

1272
01:33:40,116 --> 01:33:43,565
Well, I'd like to make
an appointment for an hour or two.

1273
01:33:43,842 --> 01:33:46,280
I'll see you at 12:00. Yeah, yeah.

1274
01:33:46,304 --> 01:33:47,723
All right, okay.

1275
01:33:55,874 --> 01:33:57,900
Today's star is Woosung.

1276
01:33:58,905 --> 01:34:00,112
Understand?

1277
01:34:00,358 --> 01:34:03,716
- If they adopt me...
- No, never.

1278
01:34:16,688 --> 01:34:21,104
Oh, thank you so much
for doing us a favor.

1279
01:34:22,318 --> 01:34:24,721
I've already told you this,

1280
01:34:26,884 --> 01:34:30,185
but my wife had a stillborn...

1281
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:33,212
I don't want to think about
the next time, so...

1282
01:34:33,236 --> 01:34:36,358
Yes, you must have had a hard time.

1283
01:34:37,611 --> 01:34:39,362
It was a girl.

1284
01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:43,154
She was a cute baby
that looked like him...

1285
01:34:44,226 --> 01:34:46,745
Oh, let's sit down
and have some coffee...

1286
01:34:46,785 --> 01:34:48,331
Oh, how about ice coffee?

1287
01:34:49,432 --> 01:34:50,432
Okay.

1288
01:34:52,128 --> 01:34:56,232
Can I hold him?

1289
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:57,735
Oh, sure, yes.

1290
01:34:57,759 --> 01:34:59,050
Excuse me...

1291
01:35:00,097 --> 01:35:02,615
Yes, iced coffee.

1292
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:04,347
- One, two, three...
- Woosung.

1293
01:35:09,613 --> 01:35:11,271
It's all right, I'm not scary.

1294
01:35:11,411 --> 01:35:12,723
Maybe he's hungry?

1295
01:35:12,747 --> 01:35:14,832
- Get the formula.
- Is he hungry?

1296
01:35:14,919 --> 01:35:18,326
- Oh, yes.
- If it's okay...

1297
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:21,114
Do you mind if
I try breastfeeding him?

1298
01:35:22,231 --> 01:35:23,827
It's fine, right?

1299
01:35:24,122 --> 01:35:26,847
Okay, then, i...
Over there, yes.

1300
01:35:26,871 --> 01:35:29,666
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you, yeah.

1301
01:35:31,459 --> 01:35:32,669
Woosung.

1302
01:35:33,607 --> 01:35:37,048
It's okay, it's all right.

1303
01:35:38,992 --> 01:35:40,426
Oh, how...

1304
01:35:44,371 --> 01:35:46,433
Drink, drink it, yes.
Yes, go ahead.

1305
01:35:48,461 --> 01:35:49,812
Oh, good.

1306
01:35:51,046 --> 01:35:52,774
Oh, that's good.

1307
01:35:58,829 --> 01:36:01,742
I didn't write it in the mail,

1308
01:36:02,352 --> 01:36:04,140
but can I make a suggestion?

1309
01:36:05,399 --> 01:36:07,174
I was thinking, in the future...

1310
01:36:08,109 --> 01:36:10,878
I want to raise Woosung as my own child.

1311
01:36:12,026 --> 01:36:15,433
So I don't want Woosung

1312
01:36:16,298 --> 01:36:19,678
to meet his biological
mother after this.

1313
01:36:20,913 --> 01:36:22,431
I'm sure it'll be hard,

1314
01:36:22,697 --> 01:36:26,018
so think about it slowly today.

1315
01:36:39,057 --> 01:36:41,367
No on a, noon a, over here.
Here, here, here.

1316
01:36:53,364 --> 01:36:54,816
Wow, that turned out good.

1317
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:56,242
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1318
01:37:04,176 --> 01:37:07,562
It's a monorail. Bye.

1319
01:37:08,652 --> 01:37:10,080
Good bye.

1320
01:37:16,583 --> 01:37:20,160
Let's take a picture here.
Let's take a picture.

1321
01:37:20,609 --> 01:37:21,870
Come in, hurry.

1322
01:37:23,694 --> 01:37:24,998
Do you have money?

1323
01:37:27,202 --> 01:37:28,335
4,000 won.

1324
01:37:34,322 --> 01:37:35,861
What prize do you want?

1325
01:37:35,885 --> 01:37:37,734
No, not yet, not yet.
I haven't tried it yet.

1326
01:37:37,758 --> 01:37:38,795
Hold on, hold on.

1327
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:40,338
The monkey doll,
the monkey doll!

1328
01:37:40,363 --> 01:37:41,643
- The monkey doll.
- I'm screwed.

1329
01:37:42,015 --> 01:37:44,310
I can't make a mistake, huh?

1330
01:37:45,742 --> 01:37:46,799
Wai, wait.

1331
01:37:46,823 --> 01:37:48,338
- I want to try it too.
- Go! Go! Go!

1332
01:37:48,423 --> 01:37:49,596
I want to try, too.

1333
01:37:54,274 --> 01:37:57,592
Hae-jin, there's a soccer field
Look.

1334
01:37:57,616 --> 01:37:58,867
- Okay.
- Yeah?

1335
01:37:59,383 --> 01:38:01,354
- That's the soccer field.
- Okay.

1336
01:38:02,642 --> 01:38:06,543
I'm scared right now.
I'm afraid of heights.

1337
01:38:06,838 --> 01:38:10,422
Oh, my
But you said wanted to ride it.

1338
01:38:11,082 --> 01:38:12,619
Back then, I was just...

1339
01:38:12,643 --> 01:38:15,354
Hey, what's wrong with your face?

1340
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:17,446
Hey, you're not going
to throw up, are you?

1341
01:38:17,470 --> 01:38:20,181
Why are you so blue?
Are you okay?

1342
01:38:20,697 --> 01:38:22,627
- Hey, you can't throw up here.
- Okay.

1343
01:38:22,684 --> 01:38:23,728
- Huh?
- Okay.

1344
01:38:24,448 --> 01:38:26,308
- Don't throw up here.
- Okay.

1345
01:38:26,784 --> 01:38:30,610
Gosh, this kid. I tried to be
nice to you like a mother, but...

1346
01:38:30,927 --> 01:38:32,696
Take me there.

1347
01:38:32,846 --> 01:38:34,700
- Where?
- The new car...

1348
01:38:34,724 --> 01:38:36,676
- Huh?
- New car...

1349
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:38,545
- A new car? A new car?
- Yeah.

1350
01:38:39,099 --> 01:38:41,270
You mean, with the water
on top, you like that?

1351
01:38:41,294 --> 01:38:42,294
Yes.

1352
01:38:43,833 --> 01:38:47,967
Okay, let's come back
when things go well tomorrow.

1353
01:38:48,599 --> 01:38:49,903
When we get there, - Yes.

1354
01:38:49,927 --> 01:38:50,959
Tell me.

1355
01:38:50,984 --> 01:38:52,651
Sure, yes.

1356
01:38:53,036 --> 01:38:54,887
- Don't throw up.
- Okay.

1357
01:38:55,030 --> 01:38:57,039
Oh, this kid, gosh...

1358
01:39:13,624 --> 01:39:15,283
Should we look for more?

1359
01:39:20,662 --> 01:39:24,184
Or you can quit.
You can send him for adoption.

1360
01:39:28,312 --> 01:39:29,574
Still...

1361
01:39:32,210 --> 01:39:33,511
Then

1362
01:39:34,538 --> 01:39:36,223
we can raise him.

1363
01:39:40,188 --> 01:39:41,330
We?

1364
01:39:43,306 --> 01:39:44,439
The four of us...

1365
01:39:46,454 --> 01:39:49,654
The five of us, with
Hae-jin, that sounds nice.

1366
01:39:52,893 --> 01:39:56,702
What a weird family.
Who's father is who's dad?

1367
01:40:02,988 --> 01:40:04,714
I'll be Woosung's dad.

1368
01:40:09,783 --> 01:40:12,511
That's what people usually say
when they propose, you know?

1369
01:40:14,741 --> 01:40:15,861
Is that so?

1370
01:40:27,364 --> 01:40:30,390
I wish I could start over like that.

1371
01:40:44,568 --> 01:40:46,130
But it won't work.

1372
01:40:48,909 --> 01:40:51,011
I'm gonna be arrested soon.

1373
01:40:57,818 --> 01:41:00,606
Moon, a prostitute in Busan,

1374
01:41:00,646 --> 01:41:03,031
killed a man and ran away.

1375
01:41:04,164 --> 01:41:07,320
When the baby got in the way,
she throws it away in the baby box.

1376
01:41:20,150 --> 01:41:21,711
Does it come out like this?

1377
01:41:25,689 --> 01:41:28,090
They don't blur the face these days.

1378
01:41:30,899 --> 01:41:32,148
Oh, yeah?

1379
01:41:38,834 --> 01:41:40,811
It shook a bit, right?

1380
01:41:43,424 --> 01:41:46,570
It's okay. It's because
we're at the top.

1381
01:41:49,971 --> 01:41:52,534
I'm scared 'cause
I can't see anything.

1382
01:41:53,957 --> 01:41:55,163
It's weird...

1383
01:42:10,989 --> 01:42:13,891
I feel a bit relaxed
when I see you.

1384
01:42:16,317 --> 01:42:17,436
Why is that?

1385
01:42:18,958 --> 01:42:20,273
My mother...

1386
01:42:22,795 --> 01:42:26,029
I thought there might be
a reason why she had to abandon me.

1387
01:42:36,649 --> 01:42:37,959
But still...

1388
01:42:40,742 --> 01:42:43,132
You don't have to forgive her.

1389
01:42:45,281 --> 01:42:48,429
Because it doesn't change
the fact that she's a terrible mother.

1390
01:42:57,291 --> 01:42:58,433
That's why.

1391
01:43:01,164 --> 01:43:03,108
I will forgive you instead.

1392
01:43:17,361 --> 01:43:19,837
Woosung will never forgive me.

1393
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:27,155
You threw away Woosung

1394
01:43:29,011 --> 01:43:31,850
because you didn't
want to make him a murderer's child.

1395
01:43:39,335 --> 01:43:40,645
But still,

1396
01:43:44,078 --> 01:43:46,055
I threw him away.

1397
01:44:07,162 --> 01:44:10,308
I guess I was the one
who wanted to sell him the most.

1398
01:44:14,968 --> 01:44:17,066
We're more like brokers.

1399
01:44:37,851 --> 01:44:40,776
Was it when you were young?

1400
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,300
You were in my arms

1401
01:44:42,898 --> 01:44:44,803
you almost threw up, but...

1402
01:44:45,031 --> 01:44:47,974
You didn't throw up.
I hugged you against my stomach.

1403
01:44:48,759 --> 01:44:52,645
I don't remember.
I was 3 years old.

1404
01:44:54,730 --> 01:44:56,445
Has it been that long?

1405
01:44:59,048 --> 01:45:02,906
How can you solve
such a difficult question already?

1406
01:45:08,823 --> 01:45:11,416
Why? Who is it?

1407
01:45:11,826 --> 01:45:13,001
Mom.

1408
01:45:13,443 --> 01:45:14,669
Why? Answer it.

1409
01:45:15,228 --> 01:45:17,332
What? Is it a text message?

1410
01:45:17,498 --> 01:45:18,958
Text her back.

1411
01:45:19,402 --> 01:45:21,385
Should we take a
selfie and send it to her?

1412
01:45:21,533 --> 01:45:22,544
It's fine.

1413
01:45:22,569 --> 01:45:25,195
Here's your order.
Enjoy your meal.

1414
01:45:26,957 --> 01:45:28,934
Dig in. It looks delicious.

1415
01:45:31,863 --> 01:45:36,193
Dad will have
a lot of money coming tomorrow.

1416
01:45:37,192 --> 01:45:40,989
Then like in the past,

1417
01:45:41,075 --> 01:45:43,167
the three of us in Busan.

1418
01:45:44,278 --> 01:45:46,828
Oh, daddy can come to Seoul...

1419
01:45:48,474 --> 01:45:53,235
Now that you have money,
please don't contact me again.

1420
01:45:54,782 --> 01:45:57,182
That's what mom said.

1421
01:45:59,935 --> 01:46:01,181
Mom did...

1422
01:46:04,506 --> 01:46:08,190
But she seriously told me
don't ever come back home.

1423
01:46:12,233 --> 01:46:15,651
Last time, daddy was so drunk.

1424
01:46:15,929 --> 01:46:19,112
Oh, this straw is

1425
01:46:19,749 --> 01:46:21,448
a heart. It's shaped like a heart.

1426
01:46:24,492 --> 01:46:25,829
You know what,

1427
01:46:27,235 --> 01:46:29,416
the baby's going to be born soon.

1428
01:46:32,423 --> 01:46:33,587
Mom's?

1429
01:46:34,822 --> 01:46:37,591
Yes, a boy.

1430
01:46:42,747 --> 01:46:44,266
Oh, I see.

1431
01:46:47,739 --> 01:46:50,981
Well, then tell your
mom congratulations.

1432
01:46:52,986 --> 01:46:54,315
Sorry.

1433
01:46:55,956 --> 01:46:57,430
Oh, don't be.

1434
01:47:00,347 --> 01:47:05,496
But I'll continue to be your dad.

1435
01:47:06,214 --> 01:47:07,214
Right?

1436
01:47:09,416 --> 01:47:10,532
Really?

1437
01:47:16,309 --> 01:47:17,384
Of couse.

1438
01:47:20,582 --> 01:47:22,014
I better go.

1439
01:47:25,691 --> 01:47:26,884
Let's meet again.

1440
01:48:12,407 --> 01:48:15,549
Steak, steak...

1441
01:48:15,573 --> 01:48:17,157
Should I try that?

1442
01:48:17,954 --> 01:48:21,263
Anyway, I wish you success tomorrow...

1443
01:48:21,287 --> 01:48:22,287
Here.

1444
01:48:23,087 --> 01:48:24,331
Here...

1445
01:48:32,198 --> 01:48:34,611
Woosung, say, "Hae-jin hyung."

1446
01:48:34,635 --> 01:48:36,511
"Hae-jin hyung. Hae-jin hyung."

1447
01:48:38,221 --> 01:48:39,847
Oh! He said Hae-jin.

1448
01:48:40,779 --> 01:48:42,125
That must be you.

1449
01:48:43,112 --> 01:48:46,605
- Woosung, did you? Right?
- That's right, he did.

1450
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:50,818
Woosung, you must never forget it.

1451
01:48:51,444 --> 01:48:52,921
He will forget it soon.

1452
01:48:54,082 --> 01:48:58,091
You just have to remember everything,
even on Woosung's behalf.

1453
01:48:59,494 --> 01:49:03,432
Gosh, this kid. No matter how
you look at it, he's really unfortunate.

1454
01:49:03,456 --> 01:49:05,000
I totally agree.

1455
01:49:07,129 --> 01:49:09,971
Woosung, we really had fun today,

1456
01:49:10,599 --> 01:49:13,634
so let's not forget
about today in the future.

1457
01:49:15,094 --> 01:49:18,807
So young doesn't talk to Woosung.

1458
01:49:20,772 --> 01:49:22,072
No?

1459
01:49:22,454 --> 01:49:25,397
No, I've never seen it before either.

1460
01:49:28,311 --> 01:49:30,026
It's the last day. Say something.

1461
01:49:32,155 --> 01:49:33,739
What should I say?

1462
01:49:35,617 --> 01:49:37,459
Well, anything.

1463
01:49:39,359 --> 01:49:42,081
Well, "Thank you for being born." there.

1464
01:49:42,992 --> 01:49:45,032
Well, people usually say
something like that, what?

1465
01:49:46,922 --> 01:49:48,789
He doesn't even understand anything.

1466
01:49:48,813 --> 01:49:50,298
Even if he doesn't understand

1467
01:49:51,477 --> 01:49:54,636
he would want to
hear it at least once...

1468
01:50:05,506 --> 01:50:09,778
Sister, then tell us everything.

1469
01:50:10,634 --> 01:50:12,197
- Everything?
- Yes.

1470
01:50:13,033 --> 01:50:15,283
- Everything, here?
- Yes!

1471
01:50:16,087 --> 01:50:17,786
This idiot.

1472
01:50:18,311 --> 01:50:19,454
I'll pass.

1473
01:50:20,220 --> 01:50:21,266
What?

1474
01:50:21,290 --> 01:50:23,083
If she talks first to him...

1475
01:50:25,347 --> 01:50:27,297
Then, I'll pass, too.

1476
01:50:35,519 --> 01:50:37,474
Fine, I'll talk to him.

1477
01:50:40,544 --> 01:50:42,313
Everyone, close your eyes, then.

1478
01:50:43,923 --> 01:50:45,358
W-Wait, wait a second!

1479
01:50:47,442 --> 01:50:48,694
Let's turn off the light.

1480
01:50:49,988 --> 01:50:52,365
What, hey!

1481
01:50:52,413 --> 01:50:54,623
If you turn off the lights,
How can I eat my steak...

1482
01:50:54,768 --> 01:50:57,287
Hey! Don't turn off the lights.

1483
01:50:58,287 --> 01:51:00,082
Don't turn it off...

1484
01:51:03,865 --> 01:51:06,096
Okay, I'm going to start.

1485
01:51:11,161 --> 01:51:15,682
Hae-jin, thank you for being born.

1486
01:51:20,303 --> 01:51:21,604
Sang-hyun,

1487
01:51:24,585 --> 01:51:26,526
thank you for being born.

1488
01:51:29,609 --> 01:51:30,990
Dong-soo,

1489
01:51:34,304 --> 01:51:36,120
thank you for being born.

1490
01:51:41,233 --> 01:51:42,502
Woosung,

1491
01:51:46,157 --> 01:51:47,990
thank you

1492
01:51:50,908 --> 01:51:52,096
for being born.

1493
01:51:55,127 --> 01:51:56,392
So-young,

1494
01:52:00,987 --> 01:52:03,483
So young, thank you for being born, too.

1495
01:52:15,647 --> 01:52:18,583
Now, now, let's sleep everyone.

1496
01:52:20,058 --> 01:52:21,252
Good night.

1497
01:53:01,611 --> 01:53:03,507
I'll make a suggestion.

1498
01:53:09,546 --> 01:53:11,723
Let's say you turn yourself in.

1499
01:53:13,687 --> 01:53:14,687
What?

1500
01:53:15,309 --> 01:53:18,648
Woosung...
You don't have to sell him anymore.

1501
01:53:19,953 --> 01:53:22,360
What, you said to sell him,
and now I shouldn't?

1502
01:53:23,243 --> 01:53:25,172
If you turn yourself in,

1503
01:53:25,196 --> 01:53:28,449
you'll be on parole
for the first time in three years.

1504
01:53:30,273 --> 01:53:33,751
Then, you can live with
Woosung again someday.

1505
01:53:37,494 --> 01:53:39,050
Those two people

1506
01:53:39,620 --> 01:53:42,281
cannot become parents, I'm afraid.

1507
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:46,032
I agree.

1508
01:53:48,502 --> 01:53:50,685
The couple I met today was like that.

1509
01:53:53,393 --> 01:53:56,312
Woosung is not abandoned,
he's a protected child.

1510
01:53:57,823 --> 01:54:00,251
He'll grow up talking
about that every day.

1511
01:54:03,425 --> 01:54:06,489
I hope Woosung grows up
under that kind of people.

1512
01:54:10,887 --> 01:54:12,113
Then..

1513
01:54:18,449 --> 01:54:19,759
Then..

1514
01:54:22,465 --> 01:54:24,622
He doesn't have to live like me.

1515
01:54:47,374 --> 01:54:48,483
Where are you going?

1516
01:54:52,898 --> 01:54:54,249
So-young isn't here either.

1517
01:54:55,156 --> 01:54:59,255
So young is probably meeting
with the detectives outside right now.

1518
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:03,760
So-young is not the type to sell us out.

1519
01:55:03,917 --> 01:55:06,304
No, it can happen.

1520
01:55:07,242 --> 01:55:10,141
She'll do anything for Woosung.

1521
01:55:12,157 --> 01:55:13,299
But

1522
01:55:14,689 --> 01:55:16,065
she can do that.

1523
01:55:21,392 --> 01:55:25,616
You too, man. You'll find out
when you become a parent.

1524
01:55:29,775 --> 01:55:31,377
Will So-young

1525
01:55:33,768 --> 01:55:36,253
be able to start over
if she sells us out?

1526
01:55:38,197 --> 01:55:39,214
Of course.

1527
01:55:40,319 --> 01:55:41,587
No matter what,

1528
01:55:43,104 --> 01:55:44,455
with Woosung.

1529
01:56:04,247 --> 01:56:06,369
If you go ahead,
I'll catch up with you in a while.

1530
01:56:10,083 --> 01:56:12,041
Hey, come here.

1531
01:56:12,317 --> 01:56:14,020
- Hey, Taeho.
- Come here.

1532
01:56:14,044 --> 01:56:15,426
- I need to talk to you.
- Come on.

1533
01:56:15,451 --> 01:56:16,746
- Wait.
- Let go.

1534
01:56:16,771 --> 01:56:18,872
You haven't given up yet?
Hey, wait.

1535
01:56:18,918 --> 01:56:20,688
Of course, so don't ask.

1536
01:56:22,203 --> 01:56:24,388
Hey, think about it too.

1537
01:56:24,670 --> 01:56:28,255
If that woman raises that kid,
I don't think he'll grow up.

1538
01:56:28,279 --> 01:56:30,561
Would that make you happy? Huh?

1539
01:56:30,804 --> 01:56:32,964
Why are you pretending to be nice, huh?

1540
01:56:33,201 --> 01:56:35,808
You're just a broker.
Seriously, come on, let go.

1541
01:56:36,726 --> 01:56:39,169
- Oh, seriously.
- I need to talk to you.

1542
01:56:39,562 --> 01:56:40,864
Hey, come on.

1543
01:56:44,085 --> 01:56:47,086
Do business with me
with that 40 million won, huh?

1544
01:56:50,164 --> 01:56:53,231
That's bullshit.
Why would I do that with you?

1545
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:58,199
I don't work with Dong-soo anymore.

1546
01:57:02,282 --> 01:57:03,306
What?

1547
01:57:05,002 --> 01:57:06,893
I don't know what to do with them.

1548
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:12,732
I don't need them anymore...

1549
01:57:19,890 --> 01:57:23,077
She scolded me
a lot for saying that yesterday.

1550
01:57:23,908 --> 01:57:26,089
You suddenly brought that up.

1551
01:57:26,784 --> 01:57:28,399
We're being rude to his mother.

1552
01:57:29,281 --> 01:57:31,092
So, uh

1553
01:57:31,206 --> 01:57:33,895
you can call us whenever
you want to see him.

1554
01:57:33,919 --> 01:57:35,920
Please tell his mother, please.

1555
01:57:37,492 --> 01:57:41,096
I don't want to hide anything from him.

1556
01:57:43,871 --> 01:57:45,850
I think it would be okay

1557
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:49,239
even if we would send away

1558
01:57:51,060 --> 01:57:53,317
Woosung to people like you.

1559
01:57:57,680 --> 01:57:59,532
Oh? Who is that?

1560
01:58:00,583 --> 01:58:01,948
Maybe Sang-hyun.

1561
01:58:04,826 --> 01:58:07,249
Yes, who are you?

1562
01:58:09,271 --> 01:58:10,580
This is the police.

1563
01:58:11,436 --> 01:58:13,313
No, this is... What is this?
May I help you?

1564
01:58:13,338 --> 01:58:16,091
I need you to come with me
on charges of illegal child trafficking.

1565
01:58:16,116 --> 01:58:17,451
Honey.

1566
01:58:17,498 --> 01:58:18,860
You stay in there for a second.

1567
01:58:18,885 --> 01:58:20,799
Well, wait a minute. I'll go out...

1568
01:58:21,797 --> 01:58:25,185
Mr. Kim Dong-soo? You're under
arrest for human trafficking charges.

1569
01:58:26,055 --> 01:58:27,146
Dong-soo hyung!

1570
01:58:34,734 --> 01:58:36,021
Where is So-young?

1571
01:58:37,836 --> 01:58:39,326
She turned herself in.

1572
01:58:42,193 --> 01:58:43,751
What about the other one?

1573
01:58:46,677 --> 01:58:48,005
I don't know.

1574
01:58:50,946 --> 01:58:52,797
- Take him away.
- Yes.

1575
01:59:05,171 --> 01:59:06,312
Let's go.

1576
01:59:32,256 --> 01:59:34,175
