1
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,036
My name is Alice.

2
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,608
I worked for the Umbrella Corporation..

3
00:04:17,415 --> 00:04:19,948
The largest and most powerful commercial entity in the world.

4
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:24,210
I was head of security at a secret
high tech facility called the Hive..

5
00:04:24,824 --> 00:04:29,124
A giant underground laboratory
Developing experimental viral weaponry.

6
00:04:31,235 --> 00:04:34,652
There was an incident, the virus escaped...

7
00:04:36,072 --> 00:04:37,417
A lot of people died.

8
00:04:38,376 --> 00:04:39,528
(Screams)

9
00:04:40,372 --> 00:04:42,714
Trouble was.. they didn't stay dead.

10
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:50,430
The computer that controlled the Hive was a state of the art
artificial intelligence the Red Queen.

11
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:56,995
The Red Queen responded to the threat
Of the viral outbreak in an extreme way..

12
00:04:57,917 --> 00:04:59,414
She went homicidal

13
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,870
(Red Queen)
You're all going to die down here.

14
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:06,247
The Red Queen attempted to kill everyone
Whether they were infected or not.

15
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:12,543
I managed to escape but this was only the beginning.

16
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:18,724
Viral outbreak spread like wildfire

17
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:23,293
First across the United States, then the world..

18
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,823
But the T virus didn't just bring the dead back to life..

19
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:31,393
It mutated them in terrifying ways.

20
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:38,956
Despite the apocalypse they had created the
Umbrella Corporation continued to experiment with the deadly virus

21
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:44,522
I was infected but the virus
Bonded with me on the cellular level..

22
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:47,171
I developed powers.

23
00:05:50,856 --> 00:05:51,854
I became different.

24
00:05:54,197 --> 00:05:56,692
Powerful.  Unstoppable.

25
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,836
As I got stronger the human race became weaker

26
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:08,285
I tried my best to lead what survivors I could find to safety,
But we were pursued relentlessly.

27
00:06:09,131 --> 00:06:12,048
Even my friend Jill Valentine was
seized and brainwashed by Umbrella

28
00:06:13,814 --> 00:06:18,267
Finally I confronted the head of the
Umbrella Corporation Albert Wesker..

29
00:06:19,265 --> 00:06:22,413
He robbed me of my powers but
I still managed to defeat him.

30
00:06:23,564 --> 00:06:29,170
At last we thought it was over..
We thought we had survived the horror..

31
00:06:33,047 --> 00:06:40,303
But we were wrong.. Once again we found ourselves fighting..
For our lives

32
00:07:14,048 --> 00:07:15,238
(Alice screams)

33
00:07:41,573 --> 00:07:47,563
Rise and shine,
C'mon babe we're late, The alarm didn't go off.

34
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:52,476
Becky's not up yet, Ms. Anderson is gonna be pissed.

35
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:56,238
You know how they get when we
drop her off late at the school.

36
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:06,412
Babe!?  You all right babe?

37
00:08:07,832 --> 00:08:11,825
Yeah...  I'll go get Becky.

38
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:17,929
I charged your batteries for you.
(Becky Signs "Thank you Dad")

39
00:08:20,117 --> 00:08:26,605
Becky?  You know Ms. Anderson,
She wants you to speak while you sign.

40
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,564
Thank you daddy.

41
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:33,477
(Whispers) When you come back from school
I have a surprise for you.

42
00:08:34,322 --> 00:08:35,473
I heard that.

43
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,387
The way these batteries are lasting less
and less we'll need to get some new ones.

44
00:08:40,848 --> 00:08:44,380
- OK well I can pick some up on my way home.
- I'm going to be late.. again.

45
00:08:45,647 --> 00:08:49,563
- Ah Shit!
- I'll get you another shirt from the bedroom..

46
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:56,204
- Someone picked up your dry cleaning yesterday.
- You know you're my little angel don't you?

47
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,314
- You're going to be late remember?
- Oh.. yeah

48
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:00,965
(Slaps Rear)

49
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:04,036
I'll get you that shirt.

50
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:07,491
Get Becky back.. Ahhh!

51
00:09:10,101 --> 00:09:10,946
No!!

52
00:09:20,044 --> 00:09:23,576
Help!! Help Us!!

53
00:09:25,918 --> 00:09:26,954
(Becky Screams)

54
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:34,978
C'mon!

55

57
00:10:52,795 --> 00:10:55,213
Go! Go!!

58
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,591

(Helicopter overhead, Sirens)

61
00:11:12,527 --> 00:11:14,638
Wait!  Wait!!

62
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:19,208
What the hell is wrong with you?

63
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,856
C'mon get in the car!

64
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:30,302
(Zombie Snarls, Alice Screams)

65
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:40,092
- What's going on?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

66
00:11:40,437 --> 00:11:43,163
- Why are these people doing this?
- Those things are not people..

67
00:11:43,777 --> 00:11:45,581
Not anymo.. (Crash)

68
00:11:53,068 --> 00:11:58,634
(Car Alarms Blaring)

69
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:08,347
Are you hurt?

70
00:12:11,226 --> 00:12:13,721
Can you move?  OK.

71
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,560
(Alice Grunts)

72
00:12:33,722 --> 00:12:34,835
Oh shit!!

73
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,936
(Alice Grunts and Locks Door)

74
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:45,738

(Alice Groans)

79
00:15:08,204 --> 00:15:16,151
- Project Alice why did you turn against Umbrella?
- Jill is that you?

80
00:15:16,996 --> 00:15:22,831
- Project Alice why did you turn against Umbrella?
- What happened to Chris and Claire?

81
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,327
Where are the others from the ship?

00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:26,052
Oh yeah!

(Alice Gasps)

103
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:50,352
Don't!

104
00:24:50,774 --> 00:24:53,922
- My name is..
- Ada Wong operative for the Umbrella Corporation..

105
00:24:54,114 --> 00:24:58,645
One of Wesker's top agents..
I know exactly who and what you are..

106
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:03,942
Now the real question is..
why don't I just cancel your contract right now?

107
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:08,818
I don't work for Umbrella anymore,
and neither does Albert Wesker.

108
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:14,500
- I don't care.
- You can kill her if you like but
then you'll never know the truth

109
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:17,840
- Now be a good girl.
- Wesker!

110
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,412
Put down the knife. (Screen Shatters)

111
00:25:20,988 --> 00:25:23,329
Oh and Alice?
How nice to see you again.

112
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:28,129
- How did she get out?
- She's obviously getting help..

113
00:25:28,397 --> 00:25:33,311
- We have a traitor in this facility.
- Security Systems were shut down for 2 minutes ma'am.

114
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,921
- What about control?
- We still can't raise them.

115
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:44,560
(Ada) I executed everyone in this control room,
I enabled Wesker to hack the mainframe..

116
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:48,897
We shut down the Security Systems,
we let you out of that cell.

117
00:25:49,665 --> 00:25:51,738
(Wesker)
We have to get you out of this facility

118
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:57,573
- So why do you want to help me?
- We need you, the human race faces extinction..

119
00:25:58,379 --> 00:26:01,451
Our only hope for survival is for us to work together.

120
00:26:02,065 --> 00:26:06,211
I'm not going anywhere until I know where we are
and what the hell is going on here.

121
00:26:06,595 --> 00:26:10,280
- You're in the prime Umbrella testing facility.
- Explain Tokyo?

122
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:14,965
What you saw was just a detailed recreation,
nothing more

123
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,957
It goes on for a few city blocks that's all.

124
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:22,143
- I was outside.
- Were you?

125
00:26:22,988 --> 00:26:25,099
- Saw the sky did you?
- It was night.

126
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:32,240
- Stars? the Moon?
- The testing floor is 300 feet high, the ceiling black..

127
00:26:33,123 --> 00:26:37,384
It's usually night in there,
but isn't that when the monsters come out anyway?

128
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:43,987
- It was raining.
- Climate control, wind, rain,
They can even make it snow if they want to

129
00:26:44,716 --> 00:26:45,792
Why build such a place?

130
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:51,435
Simple, the Umbrella Corporation derived
It's primary income from the sale of viral weaponry..

131
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:54,583
Something that's impossible to test in the real world.

132
00:26:55,389 --> 00:27:02,146
They recreated the center of New York, simulated an outbreak,
showed it to the Russians and sold them the virus..

133
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,868
They simulated an outbreak in Moscow
and sold it to the Americans

134
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:09,977
- An outbreak in Tokyo.
- Sold it to the Chinese.

135
00:27:10,438 --> 00:27:13,202
- An outbreak in China.
- Sold it to the Japanese.

136
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:18,462
Exactly!  Everyone had to have it,
The Umbrella Corporation built a new arms race..

137
00:27:19,844 --> 00:27:23,567
Only this time it was biological rather than nuclear.

138
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:30,592
Highly profitable, and this is where it all happened.
This is Umbrella's greatest creation.

139
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,622
- The belly of the beast.
- So why don't we just get the hell out of here?

140
00:27:37,388 --> 00:27:45,065
Stop!  Sun up is in less than 1 minute,
Why don't you just see for yourself.

141
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:50,517
This facility is located in the straits of
Kamchatka, Northern Russia

142
00:27:51,324 --> 00:27:54,740
The old Soviet Union built submarine pens here in the 80s

143
00:27:55,508 --> 00:28:02,341
After the Cold War ended the Umbrella Corporation
expanded them and built the testing floor.

144
00:28:05,912 --> 00:28:08,522
No one has ever escaped from this facility.

145
00:28:10,134 --> 00:28:14,012
- Ice!
- You'll need all the help you can get..

146
00:28:14,703 --> 00:28:18,274
So I've arranged for a strike team
to enter from the surface and assist you.

147
00:29:01,846 --> 00:29:04,994
There they are, intake vents for the Umbrella facility.

148
00:29:08,449 --> 00:29:11,098
- Looks abandoned.
- That's what they want you to think.

149
00:29:11,866 --> 00:29:15,513
Let's move!
We have just 2 hours to extract Alice and Ada..

150
00:29:15,897 --> 00:29:18,392
After that we can expect heavy
Umbrella reinforcements.

151
00:29:31,214 --> 00:29:32,443
Running a bypass.

152
00:29:36,628 --> 00:29:38,087
These are the access codes Ada gave us.

153
00:29:38,854 --> 00:29:40,850
- You trust her?
- Just enter the numbers.

154
00:29:46,532 --> 00:29:51,178
- The charges are set.
- We're in!

155
00:30:08,376 --> 00:30:09,797
Let's go do this.

156
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:14,864
- They're in.
- The strike team has secured an elevator for your escape to the surface.

157
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:20,469
They will eliminate Umbrella resistance,
Then rendezvous with us and escort us out

158
00:30:21,313 --> 00:30:25,882
- They have a friend of yours with them.. Luther West
- He's Alive?

159
00:30:27,149 --> 00:30:29,337
All right hold on ladies.

160
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:42,390
Synchronize watches, 2 hours exactly in..3..2..1..Mark!

161
00:30:49,568 --> 00:30:52,255
Leon why don't we just trigger the explosives remotely?

162
00:30:52,909 --> 00:30:58,552
Can't risk them jamming the signal,
Whether we succeed or not this facility has to be destroyed.

163
00:31:00,088 --> 00:31:04,349
- What if we take longer than 2 hours?
- Well then I hope you're really good at holding your breath.

164
00:31:06,882 --> 00:31:12,104
Security Chief Valentine has reached the Tokyo
test environment, she's tracking you.

165
00:31:13,064 --> 00:31:14,100
They're headed this way.

166
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:20,089
Her orders are to recapture you if possible,
terminate you if necessary.

167
00:31:20,895 --> 00:31:23,468
- Who's giving these orders?
- The Red Queen.

168
00:31:23,813 --> 00:31:28,650
- the computer?
- Yes the same artificial intelligence you encountered in the Hive.

169
00:31:29,648 --> 00:31:32,374
She now controls what remains
of the Umbrella Corporation,

170
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:36,059
She will stop at nothing to prevent
you escaping to the surface.

171
00:31:36,942 --> 00:31:40,436
I've plotted an escape route for you..
You'll cross the New York environment..

172
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:43,737
To suburbia where you'll rendezvous
with the strike team..

173
00:31:44,198 --> 00:31:48,190
They'll escort you through the
Moscow environment to the submarine pens..

174
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,069
And take the elevator back to the surface.

175
00:31:51,722 --> 00:31:56,138
The Red Queen has intercepted my signal,
She's about to regain control of the facility..

176
00:31:56,637 --> 00:31:58,249
You must hurry, I can't...

177
00:32:00,706 --> 00:32:04,276
Don't listen to the traitor Wesker,
I am in control now.

178
00:32:05,197 --> 00:32:08,268
Project Alice, Ada Wong stay where you are.

179
00:32:08,805 --> 00:32:10,803
- Let's move
- Project Alice..

180
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:16,138
- You're all going to die down here!
- I've heard that before.

181
00:32:38,366 --> 00:32:43,012
Defensive formation..
Lock your targets.. Fire at will.

182
00:32:59,404 --> 00:33:00,901
Submarine pens are up ahead.

183
00:33:03,934 --> 00:33:10,115
Barry, you and I take point.
We rendezvous with Alice and Ada in 30 minutes.

184
00:33:17,064 --> 00:33:18,714
(Gunshots)

185
00:33:21,901 --> 00:33:25,048
(Gunshots)

186
00:33:27,122 --> 00:33:27,698
Clear!

187
00:33:34,493 --> 00:33:40,827
- (Whistles) now that's some hardware!
- Typhoon Class, Biggest nuclear subs the Soviets ever built.

188
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:44,743
Umbrella used them to secretly
transport Bio weapons all over the globe.

189
00:33:45,626 --> 00:33:47,853
Let's pick up the pace, we have less than 90 minutes.

190
00:33:48,505 --> 00:33:52,152
(Red Queen)
Intruders detected, targeted for termination.

191
00:33:56,567 --> 00:34:00,829
- New York.
- We need to cross two more test environments to escape.

192
00:34:01,635 --> 00:34:04,283
- Let's move!
- Why would Umbrella continue to run these tests?

193
00:34:04,821 --> 00:34:08,045
They want to study the biohazard, learn how to control it.

194
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:12,844
(Red Queen)
Initialize New York sequence, Activate biohazard.

195
00:34:16,338 --> 00:34:22,557
(Computer) Standby! Standby!
New York sequence initialized!

196
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:25,935
The Red Queen!
She's activating bio weapons to stop us.

197
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:30,658
- Let's go!
- Wait!  You hear that?

198
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:37,760
(Axe Dragging)

199
00:34:39,794 --> 00:34:42,404
- You know what it is?
- I have an idea.

200
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,330
You've got to be kidding me!

201
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:12,272
(Axemen Growl)

202
00:35:31,775 --> 00:35:33,502
(Windshield Shatters, Ada Gasps)

203
00:35:56,306 --> 00:35:58,762
(Gasoline Sloshes)

204
00:36:32,047 --> 00:36:33,238
Hey boys..

205
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,539
Bad idea!

206
00:36:47,787 --> 00:36:50,513
(Car Alarm Blares)

207
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,574
Let's move!  We're behind schedule.

208
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:17,501
- What's going on?
- It's the end of the sequence,
They rarely last more than an hour.

209
00:37:18,115 --> 00:37:22,223
C'mon.. Before the Red Queen activates something else

210
00:37:24,181 --> 00:37:28,250
(Red Queen) Target survived,
Security Chief Valentine to intercept.

211
00:37:29,824 --> 00:37:34,854
Intruders entering Moscow test environment,
Activate Los Plagos undead.

212
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:49,518
- What's going on?
- The Red Queen knows we're here, keep your eyes open.

213
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,891
(Computer) Standby! Standby!
Moscow sequence initialized.

214
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,688
- What?
- Listen!

215
00:38:08,522 --> 00:38:09,481
Right there!

216
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:19,309
What the hell are those things?

217
00:38:24,914 --> 00:38:26,795
Fall back!  Everyone fall back!

218
00:38:49,176 --> 00:38:54,168
- Clouds?
- They're not real, it's a holographic projection..

219
00:38:55,933 --> 00:39:00,386
When they were running a simulation
Trust me no one was looking at the sky.

220
00:39:07,604 --> 00:39:12,595
This is the rendezvous point,
the strike team is late, where are they?

221
00:39:14,591 --> 00:39:18,199
Someone is in the house behind you..
Upstairs window.

222
00:39:42,462 --> 00:39:43,691
Why would they be in here?

223
00:39:50,217 --> 00:39:53,096
(Alice Huffs)
They're using clones of me.

224
00:39:54,210 --> 00:40:00,582
- Of course! You were one of the 50 basic models.
- (Alice Huffs) Basic Models.

225
00:40:01,388 --> 00:40:04,459
How do you think Umbrella
populates these test scenarios?

226
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:08,298
Hundreds of people dead
each time they run a simulation..

227
00:40:09,028 --> 00:40:11,063
Umbrella imprints them with basic memories..

228
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:16,437
Just enough to ensure a correct emotional response
to the threat of the biohazard.

229
00:40:17,474 --> 00:40:22,119
In one life she could be a suburban housewife,
the next a businesswoman in New York..

230
00:40:22,618 --> 00:40:25,306
The next a soldier working for Umbrella.

231
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,415
(Upper Floor Creaks)

232
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:31,260
(Zombie Screeches)

233
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:45,464
Mommy! I hid like you told me.

234
00:41:50,723 --> 00:41:52,835
What happened to your clothes
and your hair?

235
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:37,905
RPG.. Down!!

236
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:43,510
We're running out of time..

237
00:42:44,393 --> 00:42:48,079
- You have to find as a way out now!
- Almost there!

238
00:43:06,698 --> 00:43:09,193
- None of this is real.
- It is to her.

239
00:43:09,615 --> 00:43:14,491
I know that's the point.
All these feelings she has for you, they were imprinted.

240
00:43:16,756 --> 00:43:22,745
A day ago she was a blank slate,
I could show you a dozen just like her in cold storage.

241
00:43:24,664 --> 00:43:26,507
I'm sorry, but it's true.

242
00:43:27,466 --> 00:43:32,534
- Ready! I was fast wasn't I?
- Yes you were.

243
00:44:00,136 --> 00:44:02,056
- Daddy?
- He's not your father.

244
00:44:02,632 --> 00:44:05,243
(Red Queen)
Capture if possible, terminate if necessary.

245
00:44:07,047 --> 00:44:10,387
- There's a child here.
- Your problem, not ours.

246
00:44:11,461 --> 00:44:15,607
- All heart, you haven't changed a bit.
- I don't know you lady.

247
00:44:17,259 --> 00:44:19,793
Now, surrender or die.

248
00:44:32,884 --> 00:44:33,920
Get down!

249
00:45:16,878 --> 00:45:18,107
Advance, B Team!

250
00:45:25,785 --> 00:45:29,393
You can't stay here,
This will show you the way out..

251
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:36,650
Go through Moscow to the submarine pens, take this,
The less I have with me the better.

252
00:45:38,915 --> 00:45:40,296
Alpha team forward!

253
00:46:01,641 --> 00:46:03,791
They're coming we have to hurry, Go!

254
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,249
(Leon's Gun Jams)

255
00:46:52,739 --> 00:46:54,351
I got it, this way!

256
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:06,483
- Hey!
- Wait she helped us, don't you remember?

257
00:47:08,057 --> 00:47:12,702
You two made it..
I thought I was the only one that survived.

258
00:47:13,469 --> 00:47:15,197
What is this place and why is everything in Russian?

259
00:47:16,348 --> 00:47:18,229
And what's with the S&M Getup?

260
00:47:20,302 --> 00:47:23,374
- You know how to use this?
- I campaigned for gun control.

261
00:47:26,061 --> 00:47:28,672
No I don't think you understand,
I marched against the NRA.

262
00:47:29,132 --> 00:47:34,699
Concentrate..
It's just like a camera, point and shoot.

263
00:47:38,999 --> 00:47:41,648
Congratulations you're officially a bad ass!

264
00:47:42,531 --> 00:47:46,293
(Loud Banging)
What the hell's going on here?

265
00:47:47,252 --> 00:47:49,863
I'll explain when I get back,
Right now you have to keep her safe.

266
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:53,741
- You stay with her.
- You're going? You said you wouldn't leave.

267
00:47:54,547 --> 00:47:58,117
Trust me OK?  What I say is true..
I'll come back for you.

268
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:00,727
- You promise?
- Trust me.

269
00:48:06,447 --> 00:48:07,792
I love you.

270
00:48:11,669 --> 00:48:14,970
Come on, she'll be back for you.
Gotta find a hiding place.

271
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,462
I met your sister,
She's not very nice.

272
00:48:21,688 --> 00:48:22,686
Let's try hiding down here.

273
00:48:34,741 --> 00:48:36,008
- This way!
- Let's move!

274
00:48:38,042 --> 00:48:40,500
We can work our way around the... (Screams)

275
00:49:05,415 --> 00:49:06,950
Waiting for a written invitation?

276
00:49:09,715 --> 00:49:12,249
(Tires Squeal)

277
00:49:16,433 --> 00:49:20,118
- Sweet ride!
- Well this is Moscow.

278
00:49:21,347 --> 00:49:23,381
I heard gunfire,
Thought you might need some help.

279
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:28,334
- Where's Ada?
- I don't think she made it, I'm sorry.

280
00:49:29,371 --> 00:49:31,405
- You saw her die?
- No.

281
00:49:32,864 --> 00:49:34,054
She always has a plan.

282
00:50:11,907 --> 00:50:13,635
Boys? You mind?

283
00:50:14,517 --> 00:50:16,283
- Shall we?
- My pleasure.

284
00:50:42,619 --> 00:50:43,540
(Luther Yells)

285
00:50:46,842 --> 00:50:48,262
Let me know when you plan on doing that again.

286
00:50:54,212 --> 00:50:55,325
Heads up!

287
00:51:15,097 --> 00:51:16,441
(Alice Gasps)

288
00:51:30,146 --> 00:51:31,682
Our little friend is back!

289
00:51:33,064 --> 00:51:33,908
Oh Shit!

290
00:51:38,284 --> 00:51:41,202
- Almost there.
- What are you going to do?

291
00:52:14,255 --> 00:52:18,402
(Car Sizzles and Sputters)

292
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:25,581
- Is everyone OK?
- Yeah.

293
00:52:26,464 --> 00:52:27,385
OK let's go.

294
00:52:30,034 --> 00:52:35,217
Hello? You can come out! I'm back!

295
00:52:41,052 --> 00:52:42,626
Where'd you find these guys?

296
00:52:44,238 --> 00:52:46,811
- Who's this?
- I'm Becky.

297
00:52:47,694 --> 00:52:49,997
- Hi Becky.
- This is my mom.

298
00:52:50,727 --> 00:52:54,604
- Your mom? Oh!
- Long story.

299
00:52:56,562 --> 00:52:57,752
22 minutes left.

300
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:01,975
- There's no going back the way we came.
- Yeah and we lost our map with Sergei.

301
00:53:02,474 --> 00:53:03,549
I'm on it!

302
00:53:16,486 --> 00:53:20,633
We can take this tunnel at the end there's a service shaft
That leads down to the submarine pens.

303
00:53:21,439 --> 00:53:22,245

(Rubble Moves)

305
00:53:47,006 --> 00:53:51,959
- How'd you end up working for Wesker?
- I don't work for him, things on the surface have changed.

306
00:53:53,072 --> 00:53:56,873
Wesker said you knew of some weapon,
Something I could turn the tide for us

307
00:53:59,214 --> 00:54:01,172
But I don't think I would've risked so much
for one person.

308
00:54:02,861 --> 00:54:04,474
You're probably right.

309
00:54:05,511 --> 00:54:09,273
This way!
The submarine pens are up above us.

310
00:54:10,693 --> 00:54:11,384
C'mon move!

311
00:54:30,886 --> 00:54:35,724
- The elevator platforms are up ahead.
- 11 minutes, we're gonna be OK.

312
00:54:39,448 --> 00:54:45,973
- 11 minutes, we're gonna be OK.
- (Red Queen) Accessing power grid, dispatching biohazard.

Everybody get onboard!

00:54:57,222 --> 00:55:00,984
Hold on!
Next stop menswear and sporting goods.

315
00:55:08,816 --> 00:55:09,929
Get down!

- Barry what is it?
- I don't know.

317
00:55:13,922 --> 00:55:15,995
- Where are you going?
- Somebody must have cut the power remotely.

318
00:55:19,526 --> 00:55:22,752
Be strong,
I'm gonna keep you safe.

319
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:35,305
- Can you get it back online?
- Not without the access codes.

320
00:55:38,952 --> 00:55:41,793
9 minutes..
Looks like we're going with plan B.

321
00:55:42,484 --> 00:55:44,864
- What?
- There's a reason we planted those explosives.

322
00:55:46,899 --> 00:55:48,780
(Squishing)

323
00:55:55,115 --> 00:55:55,959

(Neck Cracks)

325
00:56:02,024 --> 00:56:04,942
Mommy!! (Screams) Mommy!!

326
00:56:09,396 --> 00:56:12,851
(Barry Spits)
I feel like shit.

327
00:56:16,997 --> 00:56:17,918
She's dead!

328
00:56:27,055 --> 00:56:30,356
- What are you doing?
- She's alive, I'm going to get her.

329
00:56:30,932 --> 00:56:34,694
- I didn't lose this many friends so you could just walk away.
- I plan on coming back.

330
00:56:36,844 --> 00:56:39,148
Don't do this, you're more important than she is.

331
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:42,757
- That's where you're wrong.
- This is a mistake.

332
00:56:43,524 --> 00:56:44,868
Get out of my way.

333
00:56:54,696 --> 00:56:57,767
- Don't leave without me OK?
- Are you kidding? I'm going with you.

334
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:09,745
- Don't move, don't move.
- It's OK, go get her back.

335
00:57:37,309 --> 00:57:39,266
You like that, Huh?

336
00:59:12,786 --> 00:59:14,052
Fall back!

337
00:59:21,653 --> 00:59:27,296
- Fall back to the elevator!
- You go, I'm gonna stay here awhile.

338
00:59:28,103 --> 00:59:32,710
- Barry!
- When the countdown gets to zero you have to be on that elevator.

339
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:42,153
Someone's gotta stay here Leon..
Besides I'm kind of enjoying myself.

340
00:59:47,682 --> 00:59:50,599
- Go, go!

Bring out the prisoner!

347
01:02:05,503 --> 01:02:08,650
Cease your firing or I'll execute her.

348
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,100
Now, put down your guns and step out.

349
01:02:16,827 --> 01:02:18,248
Step out or she dies.

What the hell is that?

360
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:15,004
- Becky are you hurt?
- No I'm OK.

361
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:31,707
Told you she'd have a plan.

- I'm gonna kill you.
- Perhaps..

388
01:21:01,466 --> 01:21:03,347
But first you have work to do.

389
01:21:07,148 --> 01:21:10,373
The Red Queen is determined
to destroy all life on earth..

390
