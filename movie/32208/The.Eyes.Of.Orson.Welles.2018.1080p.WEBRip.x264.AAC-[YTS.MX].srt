3
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,090
-Dear Orson Welles...

4
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,079
Look where we are, one of the wonders of the

5
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,080
world.

6
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,719
With an eye like yours, you'll have noticed

7
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,670
something missing in this skyline.

8
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,499
The Twin Towers are no more.

9
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,659
All things come to an end, don't they?

10
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,030
People, buildings, cities.

11
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,169
That was one of the big themes in your movies.

12
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,559
You died more than 30 years ago.

13
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,519
Since then, some things haven't changed.

14
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,520
But quite a lot has changed since you died.

15
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,939
Life has become far more visual.

16
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,430
Something called the Internet has come along.

17
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,759
It's hard to explain, but see those two guys at

18
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
the bottom of this shot?

19
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,709
They're using mobile phones to send

20
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,810
pictures, not just words.

21
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,189
Or order pizza or book a flight

22
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,037
or watch 'Citizen Kane'.

23
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,120
Phones are televisions and travel agents

24
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,130
now.

25
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,300
The Internet is like black magic.

26
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,289
The addict in you, the adrenaline junkie would

27
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,290
love it.

28
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,069
What you would have done with the Internet.

29
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,199
There've been other big changes since you died.

30
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,109
We've had an African-American president in the

31
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,110
Oval Office.

32
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,580
Oh, and a guy who thinks he's Charles Foster Kane.

33
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,709
The world has become more Wellesian, Orson.

34
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,030
The despots that you were fascinated by

35
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,439
are gaining ground.

36
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,870
Things seem exaggerated.

37
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,212
But what is Wellesian?

38
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,570
Who were you?

39
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,241
When I told a waitress recently that I was making

40
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,253
a film about you, she said, "Oh, that

41
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,116
big creepy actor?

42
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,599
He gave me the willies."

43
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,942
You did act the creeps, didn't you?

44
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,830
And bullies.

45
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,037
In 'The Third Man', the camera wooshed into

46
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,709
Harry Lime, your most famous character,

47
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,950
a monster, a smirker,

48
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,850
in the limelight.

49
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,059
So the waitress was partly right.

50
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,179
Can we look at you anew, Orson?

51
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,354
Can we tell your story anew?

52
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,770
Can we?

53
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,373
I went to this secure storage unit in

54
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,110
New York.

55
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,319
And found this box.

56
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,719
What's in the box?

57
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,316
An aspect of you, Orson?

58
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,439
You left no autobiography, but you left

59
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,610
something else.

60
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,830
I took the box in a taxi.

61
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,159
That's me, 40 years after I saw

62
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,829
your film 'Touch of Evil' on TV as a boy.

63
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,442
I didn't understand it, but I swooned.

64
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,510
I felt the woosh of love.

65
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,870
You threw a rope to me when I watched it, Orson.

66
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,717
When I'm nervous now anywhere in the world,

67
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,460
I hum the tune that plays on 'Touch of Evil''s

68
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,830
pianola.

69
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,809
It's a sultry lullaby of sorts.

70
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,590
I took the box in a plane and now

71
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,729
it's in my flat.

72
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,856
What's in the box, Orson?

73
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,680
Not words or films but drawings.

74
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,420
Many have never been seen before.

75
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,770
What's in the box, Orson?

76
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,440
Visual thinking.

77
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
What's in the box, Orson?

78
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,799
A sketchbook of your life.

79
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,302
Look how freely your quill moves across the page

80
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,300
of this BBC TV documentary.

81
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,073
Scratch and scribble, lines

82
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,849
faster than you could think, for the back of the

83
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:29,899
head and the lapel.

84
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,600
Then more careful for the nose.

85
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,130
You were obsessed by noses.

86
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,196
Old-school technique, dipping into

87
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,170
an inkwell.

88
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,599
Where would you start the story of your drawing

89
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
life, Orson?

90
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,439
You said that at nine, "I'd started to paint.

91
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,919
That's what I loved the most always."

92
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,589
And then later, "I'd never been

93
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,199
excited by movies as movies as the way

94
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:05,020
I've been excited by magic or bullfighting

95
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,789
or painting."

96
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,379
Your guardian, Dr. Ben Stein, encouraged you to

97
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,560
study art in the Windy City.

98
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,379
What a transit lounge.

99
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,839
Was it a visual treat?

100
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,269
Did it affect your looking life?

101
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,420
You could look at Chicago Square on like this.

102
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,560
But surely the city of the first great skyscrapers

103
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,300
made you look upwards.

104
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,379
And you became the greatest ever filmmaker of

105
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,459
looking upwards.

106
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,620
Whether it's by craning.

107
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,459
Oh, I'm shooting below people's feet.

108
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,129
I've got this waiting for 20000

109
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,310
tons of marble to suggest power.

110
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,600
You wouldn't have to request to miniaturised

111
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,650
a character.

112
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,239
Not so loud.

113
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,169
You want to bring all the officials down on this.

114
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,760
Ask who you are.

115
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,429
You lived here and had a drawing studio

116
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,569
here in Rush Street.

117
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,869
It was just big enough for your band and a large

118
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,870
drawing board.

119
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,759
Your teacher said that you did dozens of sketches

120
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,220
here, but three, most of them away.

121
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,569
But you studied drawing here, didn't you?

122
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,000
The Art Institute of Chicago

123
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,099
in your early teens.

124
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,239
Do you remember as a boy sitting on the tail

125
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,649
of its famous lions?

126
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,030
And inside.

127
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,380
What did you see?

128
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Europe.

129
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,890
Myths.

130
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,820
Bodies.

131
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,730
Selfhood.

132
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,810
Pointers to your future.

133
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,000
Translucent ceilings lit from above.

134
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,669
A technique used in the trial

135
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,690
could be similar to the right.

136
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,500
Where are you? I need Mr. BLOCK.

137
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,700
You are high here.

138
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:46,009
And citizen, can you talk about the

139
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,989
people as though you own them?

140
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,709
Years later, if you knew someone who was going

141
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,259
to the Art Institute, he told them to go

142
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,299
and see these miniature rims.

143
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,789
Did there look there wideness

144
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,729
influence any of the visuals in your films,

145
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,879
the train of voicing of.

146
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,860
I think.

147
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,789
If you could be here now, your eyes would be

148
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,929
ducting. Awesomer.

149
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,999
Chicago's got new ways of seeing.

150
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,070
So you're drawing and painting life had begun.

151
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,909
It continued for 60 years.

152
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,799
You drew everywhere.

153
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,613
You went to there at least a thousand

154
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,860
of your artworks.

155
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Where are they now?

156
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,399
Many are in Michigan, in Ann

157
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,100
Arbor, which was named after its trees.

158
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,599
Here in the University of Michigan's archive,

159
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,940
they have your relics.

160
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,990
Your beloved knows Putti.

161
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,200
Kuchu war as Rochester in Jane Eyre.

162
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,169
Letters from you and to you.

163
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,389
This one's from Vivien Lee.

164
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,620
And then there are your drawings themselves.

165
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,240
Another place where I find your artworks was here.

166
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,340
Can you guess where I am?

167
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,110
And who lives here?

168
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,350
Brace yourself. Awesome.

169
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,649
It's Beatrice, your third daughter.

170
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,499
She's in her 60s now, which is still

171
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,049
a rocker chick and sometimes

172
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,340
drives with no hands.

173
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,329
So what am I doing? First getting these are

174
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,682
though, all of those should be his paintings, if

175
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,860
I remember. Right.

176
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,610
That is gorgeous. That is not.

177
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,960
Well, it does. I see that fabulous.

178
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,150
A Christmas card.

179
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,190
It was a Christmas card.

180
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,529
That's sort of what I saw this morning when I got

181
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,840
up. That's right. I called it Broadway Blues.

182
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,940
Mm hmm.

183
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,789
And that, you know about a

184
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,060
producer saying so.

185
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,880
Sorry, Mr. Wells, we have got around to

186
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,440
reading. Yes.

187
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,660
Yes.

188
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,370
He's saying, hey, but my players are.

189
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,450
Yes, exactly that.

190
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,779
That's him. And where did the money go to?

191
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,179
You see, it's just it's my life and my father.

192
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,634
Some sign he put here some

193
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,169
Broadway blues.

194
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,989
This is in Munich. This is when he was traveling

195
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,459
with his father around the world.

196
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,929
This is before he got to Ireland was.

197
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,380
No. Oh, yes. This is probably when he was about, I

198
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,450
think, 12.

199
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,620
And that's in Munich.

200
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,759
And then here he's an idealist

201
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,770
family. This.

202
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,099
So he'd been to Shanghai at this point they so

203
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,539
hence this particular one.

204
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,690
And then these look like German Karaca

205
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,820
Chinese weighted to Germany, obviously

206
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,829
a drawing of you painting Austen.

207
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,970
Look how many kisses you put on this letter.

208
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,124
And I just had a look at this picture and then

209
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,969
I remembered that this was the day that

210
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,490
the painting he drew when they threw him out of

211
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,339
the window, when I

212
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,480
said, you can't come back.

213
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,059
You can't touch your movie, which is this

214
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,060
one. Yeah.

215
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,790
And as you can see, the anger in it.

216
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,049
I mean, you can just.

217
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
Thank you.

218
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,409
You took a line for a walk.

219
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,679
Portraits, sketches and letters.

220
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,590
Costume designs, stage layouts.

221
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,019
Backdrop plans, Christmas cards,

222
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,049
pictures of your loves and travels.

223
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,860
You drew compulsively.

224
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,960
A lifetime of lines.

225
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,299
Were you in the zone when you drew awesome like

226
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,779
sports people are in the zone.

227
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,240
Do your sketches Shusha on conscious?

228
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,559
Can we glimpse in them the story of your life?

229
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,380
It's politics, love and power.

230
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,759
Ordinary people. Awesome.

231
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,259
The 20th century was theirs.

232
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,870
Many got to vote for the first time.

233
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,440
Old elites lost power.

234
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,850
Was they extraordinary wells, very

235
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,900
ordinary?

236
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,799
Did you know many working class people?

237
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,429
My own allegiance

238
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:03,019
is stronger to the idea of citizenship

239
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,879
than my own loyalty is greater the idea

240
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,429
of myself as a member of the human family

241
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,320
than it is to a as a member of

242
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,370
any profession.

243
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,690
I don't take art as seriously as politics.

244
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,980
The hotel now he's in Paris, 1960,

245
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,099
a TV interview.

246
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,940
How solid you are in the frame

247
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,929
and then your laugh and that trademark cigar.

248
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,320
But where did your belief in citizenship start?

249
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,230
With your mother, Beatrice.

250
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,739
She co-founded the Women's Alliance

251
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,330
to help Chicago's poor,

252
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,169
her activism was inspired by this Unitarian

253
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,960
Church, which was open to all races

254
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,990
and classes.

255
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,249
The Women's Alliance hosted speeches on the

256
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,159
persecution of Jews in Russia.

257
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,569
Your mother was the first woman in your hometown

258
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,359
of Kenosha ever to be elected to public

259
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,360
office.

260
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,780
She had a community tree planted.

261
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,399
I think it's this one to raise

262
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,360
money so that every Canosa child between

263
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,860
2 and 14 would receive

264
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,049
a Christmas gift.

265
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,949
One of the reasons you painted and drew Christmas

266
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:25,220
trees so often awesome in impasto,

267
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,240
snow, white paint and black card.

268
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,249
A black line helix daubed with green and

269
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,919
red, a gothic black

270
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,359
ink tree in the sunshine.

271
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,589
An eight second test of pine

272
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,860
agrees a tree encased

273
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,239
magenta and sage, a

274
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,429
pine branch and ink and brush wash.

275
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,299
Helix and White tonight were just two hieroglyph.

276
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,059
All distant reminders of your mother, perhaps.

277
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,430
What a woman she was.

278
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,739
This film should be about her.

279
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,439
She laid the foundation of your political beliefs,

280
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,829
but she died when you were just nine.

281
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,309
And then the Wall Street crash came.

282
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,579
The depression brought new realism in American

283
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,249
art, but something more personal happened

284
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,916
to you. Orson, that further shaped

285
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,010
your politics.

286
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,030
Took a boat.

287
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,839
The S.S. Baltic to Ireland

288
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,749
explicitly to draw and paint.

289
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,059
We can feel your 16 year old eyes darting about

290
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,200
on the Baltic. Awesome.

291
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,239
There are four liquor's alone in this small

292
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,950
section of one of your drawings.

293
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,019
They're befuddled. Suspicious or glowing?

294
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,489
What you saw on the boat was people,

295
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,759
real people like you'd seldom

296
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,760
seen before.

297
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,810
What about this woman's twisty jaw line and pursed

298
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,940
lips?

299
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,460
And these two profiles that

300
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,650
they know you were drawing them.

301
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,680
Did this guy.

302
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,920
Your background was privileged, but on the Baltic,

303
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,009
you met migrants and really looked at

304
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,010
them.

305
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,299
You later became fascinated by aging, sagging

306
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,300
faces.

307
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,219
It's just 23 in the play.

308
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,259
Heartbreak House.

309
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,259
You were like the man you drew on the Baltic.

310
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,070
Were you in a hurry to get old Dawson

311
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,369
youth or you or

312
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,099
maybe in the months and Ireland, your youth

313
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
ended and

314
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,809
then you set foot on Ireland?

315
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,560
You wrote Our very landing was

316
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
dramatic.

317
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,479
Men and women good on their knees, weeping for

318
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,480
joy.

319
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,769
It's almost beyond belief that two days

320
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,499
journeying from the world's greatest metropolis

321
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,680
brings one to a land where an intelligent

322
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,589
and aristocratic people lives in

323
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,329
archaic simplicity.

324
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,510
Intelligent, aristocratic,

325
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,283
archaic, the words you used

326
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,040
about the Irish were rich.

327
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,039
Indeed, you wrote in 16

328
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,349
short years of living, nothing

329
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,079
comparable with Galway in the west of Ireland

330
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,769
has loomed so unexpectedly or breathtakingly

331
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,270
on my horizon.

332
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,560
You bought a donkey, she dog and cart

333
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,620
and roughed it.

334
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,180
You wrote, I curled up under the cart

335
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,420
and fell asleep.

336
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,700
There were nights too spent in cottages,

337
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,790
weeks, weddings and match makings.

338
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,839
My week with the band of gypsies, my

339
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,690
mountain climbs, my night

340
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,780
in the quagmire,

341
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,650
you really encountered the old world.

342
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,489
You spoke of these people who produced

343
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,489
and flourished in Teuton Common's time.

344
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,326
You painted hundreds of landscapes here, but

345
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,450
destroyed them.

346
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,660
It was the people and faces that you preferred.

347
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,990
He went to the Ahran Islands and came across

348
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,599
a visual world as exciting as

349
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Chicago.

350
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,450
It's here that the documentaries Robert Flaherty

351
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,762
had made this film, which he'd started

352
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,369
shooting in the same year that you were there.

353
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,109
His eyes scanned between faces to

354
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,269
the camera, pans between them.

355
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,779
Your mother had taken you to see his early film,

356
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,209
Nanook of the North, and you loved it.

357
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,589
Now you were in the world of his movies.

358
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,580
More profiles,

359
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,930
pencil and then ink wash.

360
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,210
Same for Mr Costello.

361
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,560
A Gallaway shopkeeper.

362
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,640
This man has sold himself to the black one.

363
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,740
Your note says.

364
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,249
And so you have devils and wanking around the edge

365
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,250
of the page

366
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,829
and ski slope noses, your most

367
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,780
geometric Irish sketches.

368
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,510
It's like you're using a protractor.

369
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,029
And then you work for Dublin.

370
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,019
Were you famously blagged your way into the Gate

371
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,030
Theater?

372
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,259
You claim to be famous and then in Ireland

373
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,320
became so.

374
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,439
You drew makeup sketches for the performance at

375
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,509
the gate that made headlines.

376
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,070
Carl Alexander.

377
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,420
But again, your eyes darted to new types of faces

378
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,460
in the three on the right.

379
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,109
Your hand was getting freer.

380
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,800
Looking at Irish people was training you to look

381
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,460
to draw.

382
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,259
Talk about taking a line for.

383
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,189
So to your mother's politics and Harlins

384
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,736
now let's add a third encounter with working

385
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,130
people.

386
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,999
Two years after Ireland, you went here.

387
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,590
Morocco.

388
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,679
Another new visual world for you.

389
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,349
A faster place with it.

390
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,413
New polls in your Irish drawings is confidently

391
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,940
done.

392
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,989
Is this guys on the left, his left elbow

393
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,040
and has raised knee.

394
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,559
Less than a dozen pencil lines give us

395
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,800
the shape of his body.

396
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:31,850
Hundreds, his Juba.

397
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,789
This is better still the diagonal of the

398
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,160
long pipe of the big guy on the left

399
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,279
set the line for the shadows on his face.

400
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,023
JButton legs on the wall on

401
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,220
the left.

402
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,599
You were seeing real people better than ever.

403
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,630
Awesome.

404
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,640
And these three women thing

405
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,759
from left to right, a dark face,

406
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,260
what looks like glasses.

407
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,410
And then that beautiful single eye.

408
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,839
And a drawing like this is echoed 22

409
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,850
years later.

410
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,869
In a moment like this in your film, Mr. Arkadin.

411
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,641
You walked towards us and then one of your frames

412
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,349
within frames.

413
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,770
Also, in the summer of 1933, you went here,

414
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:43,130
Spain, to the gypsy quarter of Seville.

415
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:46,690
Working people again,

416
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,210
traditional culture, again, the

417
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,099
non Anglo world, the non Protestant

418
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,619
world, Catholics and Arabs were

419
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,579
more expressive than Protestants.

420
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,839
More visual in the beginning was not

421
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,990
the word.

422
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,680
Your life experience was broadening.

423
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,680
And also in 1933, of course, Hitler

424
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,455
became chancellor of Germany, Italy

425
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,180
was a police state. By then.

426
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,279
Then a year you were in New York doing radio

427
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:30,846
upon medium intimate and

428
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,769
personal dictators and

429
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,770
Democrats were devoted to it.

430
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,769
It let you get into the minds of the people

431
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,659
and let you whisper to them or boom, that

432
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,959
big voice of yours.

433
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,190
You wanted to be the listeners, Grio, a

434
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,450
conciliatory, their consciousness raiser.

435
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,769
And so you acted as the announcer in a radio

436
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:00,769
play by Archibald

437
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:01,770
MacLeish.

438
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,359
It's set in a central square in a city,

439
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,859
a conquerer like Hitler's coming.

440
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,470
It's getting closer and clipped,

441
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,759
English accented voice of the announcer

442
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,040
describing what he sees.

443
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,249
It's coming clear.

444
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,869
The shadow of the sun takes him.

445
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,239
They cover their faces with fingers they color

446
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,040
before they fall this fall on the stone.

447
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,339
He's a long ways walking.

448
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,489
He marches with rattle of metal.

449
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,199
He tremble at the shadow.

450
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,320
He mounts, but the filament stamps on the stairway

451
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,050
turns.

452
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,540
His arm rises.

453
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:39,589
These guys is opening.

454
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,760
There's no one.

455
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,040
There's no one at all.

456
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:47,890
No one.

457
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,949
The helmet is hollow.

458
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,220
The metal is empty. The armor is empty.

459
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:54,680
I tell you, there's no one at all there.

460
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,970
The people invent their oppressors.

461
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,510
They wish to believe in them.

462
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,750
They wish to be free of their freedom.

463
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,319
Look, this is rising.

464
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,469
It arms rising, watching his arm

465
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,470
as it rises.

466
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
Shouting

467
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,010
like.

468
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,210
This is a calling.

469
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,700
Fascism as a beast

470
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,460
in Ireland, joujou mostly faces

471
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,730
quite a few of your later paintings and drawings

472
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,050
are faceless.

473
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,530
Like the conqueror was faceless.

474
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,620
Awesome.

475
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,506
And in films, you usually tried to hide your

476
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,719
face under whiskers, a false nose

477
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,089
or thick makeup.

478
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,549
And look awesome at how your wife, Paola,

479
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,520
Beatrice's mother, painted you.

480
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,469
We'll come to your love life later.

481
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,270
But you can't wait for that.

482
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,440
If your mom ceded your political life awesome

483
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,720
on your trips abroad, people it.

484
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,099
The rise of fascism made it ramrod.

485
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,559
So you came here to Harlem and

486
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,560
New York.

487
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,549
The year was 1936.

488
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,219
Your progressive politics were taking on a new

489
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,220
dimension.

490
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,279
The Depression had led the U.S.

491
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,560
government to launch the previous year

492
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,744
a nationwide theater project to give

493
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,806
jobs to unemployed theater and entertainment

494
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,230
workers.

495
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,792
This woman, Holly Flanagan, as much of

496
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,940
an activist as your mother made it happen.

497
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,950
Did she remind you of her?

498
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,699
The Harlem Renaissance had been a big story in the

499
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,519
1920s, but a decade later,

500
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,389
80 percent of Harlemites had no

501
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,400
work.

502
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,420
And you and your team decided to make an

503
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,119
African-American theater production of

504
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,650
Shakespeare's Macbeth.

505
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,559
You were fascinated by Macbeth.

506
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,030
You built a plasticine model of the stage,

507
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:49,299
a stylized jungle Berkoff was painted.

508
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,920
Production was conceived visually as

509
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,190
a series of pictures and chromatic ascension.

510
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,839
The setting would be Haiti,

511
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,169
the witches would be voodoo.

512
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,980
Ten thousand people showed up at the opening

513
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,410
searchlights.

514
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,770
Roads were blocked.

515
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:16,839
The excitement of something new, a new

516
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,269
way of seeing and being seen.

517
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,989
Black intellectuals in ermine and jewels.

518
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:29,150
Inside, what were they about to see,

519
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,950
their own people?

520
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,170
Plasticizers.

521
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,930
At the center of culture

522
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,490
and claim.

523
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:54,749
Want to see the Lafayette 9 Orson 80 summers

524
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,829
after your triumph?

525
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,290
You sure?

526
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,260
Okay, look.

527
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
It's no more.

528
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,859
It's apartments instead.

529
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,309
100000 people saw your voodoo

530
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,310
Macbeth.

531
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,450
The company and the crew of one hundred and ten

532
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:25,180
African-Americans went on tour with it

533
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,630
around the country.

534
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,209
The wind of change blew through the 1930s,

535
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,829
your 1930s.

536
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,040
The decade when you were in your 20s,

537
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,230
your activism grew.

538
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,250
Since we're talking about social justice,

539
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,123
I bet you're expecting me to mention The Cradle

540
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,829
Will Rock, the most famous left

541
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,496
wing theater story of the time you

542
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,380
directed it.

543
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:55,559
But the federal theater projects, government

544
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,560
sponsors are there.

545
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,650
Guards padlock the theater.

546
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,659
Are you getting goose bumps thinking about it

547
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,859
after all these years?

548
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,920
What did you do?

549
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,959
Locked out of your own theater?

550
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,890
You and your team had the audience

551
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:11,950
march way uptown to

552
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,719
an empty theater.

553
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,210
Your fancy sets were left behind.

554
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:23,019
Union rules meant that your actors couldn't

555
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,909
perform on the new stage.

556
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,384
So all that could happen was that the composer

557
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,439
Mark Bloodstone could sit at a piano

558
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,196
on the empty stage and do the show

559
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,410
alone.

560
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,479
Well, guess what?

561
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:40,089
Awesome, they've made a film of it.

562
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,275
Cooks up and blitzed and on his own

563
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,140
and nervous.

564
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,260
I

565
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,990
lie.

566
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,839
But then famously, your actors

567
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,689
stood up in the stalls and joined

568
00:33:58,690 --> 00:33:59,690
in.

569
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,570
Spotlight.

570
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,089
And then a crane shot to help the spirits

571
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,620
soar.

572
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,190
Just search

573
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,860
history.

574
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,280
Talk about people's theater.

575
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,250
And in the same year as this.

576
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,859
What a 1937 you had

577
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,280
you major anti-fascism more explicit.

578
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,800
You ripped into another Shakespeare play,

579
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,499
the one that stimulated your visual imagination

580
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,349
most and your political imagination

581
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,809
to Julius Caesar

582
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,349
as a teenager. You do Mark Anthony speech to

583
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,760
the people like this.

584
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,679
He casts a vast shadow

585
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,785
already. You are thinking of Julius Caesar in

586
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,010
terms of lighting.

587
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,689
And look what I found in the box or some

588
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,510
drawings from about 1950.

589
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,130
You were planning a film of Julius Caesar.

590
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,539
You imagine a camera above a light,

591
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,979
a pink and black sky.

592
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,119
Maybe the stormy night in Rome after the plot

593
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,159
to kill Caesar is hatched.

594
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,980
And Luke, you planned to shoot it in Rome's

595
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,030
EU are.

596
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,600
The Chile monumental district built by Mussolini's

597
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,120
fascists.

598
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,089
You saw Caesar as an ancient Mussolini, didn't

599
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,090
you?

600
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,780
And the ancient crowd didn't resist.

601
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,739
They didn't resist the Conqueror MacLeish's

602
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:54,770
play.

603
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,519
You wanted to use a hanging miniature in front of

604
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,520
the camera.

605
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,360
An old Hollywood technique.

606
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,969
You thought of the capital as a kind of beehive,

607
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,469
but back in 1937, your

608
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,540
visual ideas were even bolder.

609
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,610
It seen images of the Nazi Nuremberg rallies.

610
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:25,359
The vertical torch lights made columns

611
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,560
like a Roman temple.

612
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,510
So you hide your stage production.

613
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:30,930
Look the same.

614
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,300
And guess what? Awesome.

615
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,920
They re-created your production in the film,

616
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,510
me and Orson Welles.

617
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,829
Square on shocked that graphic white

618
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:45,230
lighting camera glides in

619
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,300
as the audience gets engrossed.

620
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,719
Case, but every noise we

621
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:57,730
still.

622
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,709
And all this before Hitler invaded Poland.

623
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,719
We've come a long way from your mother's

624
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,360
Unitarian, good deeds.

625
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:12,639
But the story of your social ideas isn't over yet.

626
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,090
Far from it.

627
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,559
You were only 22 when you did Cesar on

628
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,719
the stage after radio

629
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:23,110
and theater. You found a new medium of the people

630
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,920
movies.

631
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,690
Your first feature, of course, was 'Citizen Kane'.

632
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,372
It changed cinema and is known for its

633
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,879
expressionism and critique of vainglory.

634
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,809
But it's most touching moment is related to

635
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:41,360
your mother's ideas or your time

636
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,420
in Ireland.

637
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,089
Why did you try laughing at me again?

638
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,999
Charles Foster Kane is in the rented room of

639
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,880
a working class woman, Susan Alexander,

640
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,509
who offered him a place to clean up after

641
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,340
he got covered in mud by a passing car.

642
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,079
I'm wiggling both my ears.

643
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:59,480
Same time I'm at the top right here.

644
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,707
Photos of a woman who looks a bit like your

645
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:02,850
mother.

646
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:07,709
It took me two solid years and the best boy school

647
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,959
in the world to learn that trick fellow taught it

648
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,760
to me. Now the president of Venezuela.

649
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,070
They play a kid's shadow game.

650
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,099
He's famous, but she doesn't know it.

651
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,520
She's probably one of the most ordinary people

652
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,380
he's met in his life.

653
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,210
The camera drifts in the look of love.

654
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,849
Perhaps some of the softest

655
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,579
lighting in the film, your small

656
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,789
tribute to a powerless but sincere

657
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,550
woman. I guess you got onto that.

658
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,760
You know, it turned out a virgin in

659
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:52,569
Hollywood was more interested in glamorous people

660
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,710
in the 1940s.

661
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,929
But you spoke highly of this unpolished

662
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,090
B-movie.

663
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,569
A scene like this must have caught

664
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,570
your eye.

665
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,179
A white couples in Harlem.

666
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,570
Well, you did your Macbeth and they go into a bar.

667
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,389
No fancy lighting here.

668
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,869
No wells and angles, but a social

669
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:17,139
setting. Not often seen in escapist

670
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,470
Hollywood cinema.

671
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,691
In its old tree, the film that you shot in Brazil

672
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,829
in the early 1940s but didn't complete.

673
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,819
There's a similar sincerity and

674
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,900
fame that I'm talking about now,

675
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,570
famous in five different

676
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,059
different sound of the world.

677
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,920
They might be different colors

678
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,289
at different churches, but the same

679
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:50,079
fate, different like over the same hangover,

680
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,309
different joke with the same laugh, the different

681
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,490
humanity.

682
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:59,369
Thank God for the different because it's out of

683
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:01,320
those differences, the culture grows

684
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,079
and grows big in all directions.

685
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,169
It's like a Soviet film by Eisenstein.

686
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,950
Brilliant close-ups of On Hollywood's Faces.

687
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,369
And this same track is one of your radio

688
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,370
broadcasts.

689
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,340
But safe in Central America.

690
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,599
Argentina, thank God for Walt Disney

691
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,959
and Captain Grant or fellow Carmen

692
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,630
Miranda. Thank God for Chavez, Villalobos

693
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,619
and a thousand unknown troubadours who improvise

694
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,120
the people song. Thank God for Mark Twain

695
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,119
and Mickey Rooney and all the others

696
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:38,990
living there.

697
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,460
And look, awesome, low angle, a

698
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,540
girl crying.

699
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,499
And is that your hand reaching up to console

700
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,500
her?

701
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,989
In 1947, Joseph McCarthy was elected

702
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:04,170
senator in your home state, Wisconsin.

703
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,290
You made political speeches, no.

704
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,579
One said, in this shrinking world,

705
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,340
adult education must first enlist

706
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,530
in the war against provincialism.

707
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,013
Educators are sworn to the tremendous

708
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,449
task of telling people about

709
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
each other.

710
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,115
You received hate mail, hundreds of

711
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,920
letters.

712
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,179
One asked if you would allow your daughters

713
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,709
to be touched by Negroes.

714
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,163
Another said, if you and the other Jews of your

715
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,313
class and the Negroes want us to love

716
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,389
you, why not better yourself?

717
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,010
J. Edgar Hoover had your name

718
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,230
added to the security register.

719
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,130
Were you scared? Awesome.

720
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,069
If so, you didn't show it,

721
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,150
especially in the case of the African-American

722
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,560
soldier, Isaac Woodard.

723
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,239
Here's your drawing of him.

724
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,349
In your BBC TV show, Orson Welles Sketchbook.

725
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,650
He told his Story Square on Wall Street,

726
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,679
the camera underplaying your rage

727
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,420
was on a bus and the way fell ill.

728
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,949
He asked the bus driver to let him off.

729
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:26,750
Bus driver refused.

730
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,239
UCLA was an argument.

731
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,710
The end of which a policeman was called in to drag

732
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,579
the boy out of the bus, took him behind a building

733
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,599
and beat him viciously.

734
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,530
And while he was unconscious, poor Jen over him,

735
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,539
put him in jail, charged he was drunkenness

736
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,540
and assault.

737
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,759
When the boy regained consciousness, he discovered

738
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,760
that he was blind.

739
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,139
The policeman had literally beaten out his eyes.

740
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:58,410
A terrible crime in itself.

741
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:01,559
But the fact that Woodard ended up blind

742
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:03,959
seemed to dig deep into you.

743
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,639
Such a visual person.

744
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,401
And so on radio, you tried to

745
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:12,951
hunt down the cop who blinded

746
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,320
him.

747
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,389
The policeman's name wasn't known.

748
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:21,809
So you called him Officer X?

749
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,520
You said that he brought the justice of how and

750
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:26,989
Fitz to America.

751
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:31,750
You went on Officer X,

752
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,159
I'm talking to you.

753
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,699
Where stands the sum of common fellowship?

754
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,489
When will it rise in your dark country?

755
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:43,139
I must know Officer X, because I

756
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,510
must know where the rest of us are going

757
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:47,940
in our American experiment.

758
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:51,629
You continued awesome.

759
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:55,579
We will blast at your name Officer X..

760
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,570
I will find means to remove from you all refuge

761
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:00,889
Officer X.

762
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,929
You can't get rid of me.

763
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,176
God judge me if this isn't the most pressing

764
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,249
business I have.

765
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:11,100
The blind soldier fought for me during the war.

766
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,930
I have eyes.

767
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,050
He hasn't.

768
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:16,360
I have a voice on radio.

769
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,389
Awesome, the research carried out by you and your

770
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:27,030
associates did help find the officer.

771
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:30,679
He was chief of police Linwood Linear Schull.

772
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,079
He was tried, found not guilty

773
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:36,119
and returned to his job.

774
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:42,869
Years later, again, in your sketchbook program,

775
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,539
you drew out the lesson of the without incident.

776
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,369
Why should I speed it up?

777
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:50,489
I are leaning forward into the lens,

778
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,320
into your passionate theme.

779
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,889
I'm willing to admit that policeman has a

780
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:57,419
difficult job, very hard job,

781
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,829
but it's the essence of our society that the

782
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,460
policeman's job should be hard.

783
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:05,939
He's there to protect, protect the

784
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,900
free citizen, not to chase criminals.

785
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,389
That's an incidental part of his job.

786
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:13,289
Free citizen is always more of a nuisance to the

787
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:15,719
policeman than the criminal knows what to do about

788
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,720
the criminal.

789
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:20,219
I know it's very nice to look out of our window in

790
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,920
our comfortable home and see the policemen that

791
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:23,010
protecting our home.

792
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:24,689
We should be grateful for the policeman, but I

793
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:27,269
think we should be grateful, too, for the

794
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:28,691
laws which protect us against

795
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,060
the policemen.

796
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,010
Which brings us to here.

797
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,800
Awesome. And another story about the law.

798
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,469
You recognize this place?

799
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:42,719
One of your favorite cities.

800
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,340
The City of Light.

801
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:46,440
He drew and painted it.

802
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,589
You've seen the Eiffel Tower 100 times, of course.

803
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,460
But when you see this from the year 2000.

804
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:01,340
It has sparkled.

805
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,256
We're here. Awesome to end the story of your

806
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:07,760
political evolution.

807
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:13,039
You made a film loosely here, the trial

808
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:14,389
and the novel by Kafka.

809
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:17,199
In the box, I find this.

810
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,039
I think it's one of your early drawings for the

811
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,040
film.

812
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:25,669
Joseph Kay, who's accused of an unspecified

813
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:28,579
crime in the middle, casting a shadow.

814
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:33,099
On either side are the two agents who arrest

815
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,570
him on his 30th birthday.

816
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:38,510
In the novel case helped by a painter.

817
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,090
Hence the paintings on the wall.

818
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,300
Is that right?

819
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,420
And above highlight exactly like the one

820
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,179
you sketched for your abandoned film of Julius

821
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,180
Caesar.

822
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:52,519
You have such lights in the trial.

823
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,739
They're totalitarian for you

824
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,980
or them.

825
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,630
I can't expect you to know where the interrogation

826
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:02,820
commission is sitting.

827
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,960
That's right. I don't.

828
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:09,679
But then in Paris, you decided to film

829
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:11,300
in the abandoned garden or say.

830
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,859
Low angle, plunging perspective

831
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,960
and your drawing comes to life

832
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,610
and one of your screenshots, arrays

833
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:29,349
like an airplane taking off.

834
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:40,139
The drawing has that facelessness again.

835
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,630
The trial is about facelessness.

836
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:49,650
The law has no name Officer

837
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,680
X.

838
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,900
Go ahead with your work. My boy.

839
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,269
The trial was your portrait of the 20th century.

840
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,469
It's deskbound armies of salarymen.

841
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,599
You can't see him now.

842
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:09,690
He was a René Magritte painting in which the law

843
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:13,349
played by you is faceless at times.

844
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:17,620
Any mummified and steaming

845
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,719
like a racehorse.

846
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,500
And you famously changed the ending of the novel

847
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,549
Kafka Joseph K lead the henchman

848
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,199
to the place of his execution.

849
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,550
He acquiesces.

850
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:42,100
Anthony Perkins whispers at first.

851
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:50,829
And then yells the yell of the century.

852
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:52,830
Yeah, yeah.

853
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,800
Oh, yeah.

854
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,680
Yeah.

855
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:00,910
You have to kill me

856
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,800
a salary man in the final solution.

857
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:10,358
He was a pawn in the game of the

858
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,320
century.

859
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,869
In this on edited hand-held shot, which captures

860
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:22,749
the atmosphere of a Q&A after a screening

861
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:25,959
of the trial, you explain your change.

862
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,550
What are the changes you made?

863
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,399
The story was at the very at the very end when

864
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:32,140
Joseph is killed.

865
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,749
He's killed in a very

866
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:37,090
alarmingly different way than in the book.

867
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,969
And I was really curious as to

868
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,339
why you changed both the way he was killed and the

869
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,619
way he was acting when he died because the book

870
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:46,469
was written before the Holocaust.

871
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,210
And I couldn't bear the defeat

872
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,969
of Kay in the book after

873
00:49:58,970 --> 00:49:59,989
the Holocaust.

874
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,394
I'm not Jewish, but we are

875
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,670
all Jewish. Since the Holocaust.

876
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,650
And I couldn't bear for him to submit

877
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:13,469
to death, as he does

878
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,319
in Kafka Masochistic, fully

879
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,369
submit to death that it it stank

880
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:22,739
of the old brow Prague ghetto to me.

881
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:33,169
Your politics had come a long way from Kenosha

882
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,119
and the community tree of your mother.

883
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,138
You'd traveled the world, fallen for Irish

884
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:41,269
Islanders and Moroccan merchants and

885
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:42,979
been outraged by racism.

886
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:46,600
It felt at home in Harlem.

887
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:48,547
Become an idealist and used three

888
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:52,119
art forms radio, theater

889
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:53,925
and film to dramatize and visualize

890
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:56,150
your ideas.

891
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,809
But the Europe you so admired disgraced itself

892
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,670
in the 1930s and 40s.

893
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:07,599
And it's hard not to see that disgrace in

894
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,890
some of your drawings.

895
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,320
Even in a scribble on a menu in Rio de Janeiro.

896
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,489
What political smoke signals use and

897
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:28,890
what a trail you left.

898
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,499
We've tried to follow that trail horse and

899
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,889
see where it leads.

900
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:38,459
Eight years after you died, there was a movie

901
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,039
called Groundhog Day in which the same

902
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,770
elements were relived over and over.

903
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,279
It's sometimes good to rewind the clock, isn't it?

904
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:52,360
It's good to look at our life again

905
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,639
through another lens.

906
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,420
What's the story of your love life?

907
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:12,530
Awesome.

908
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,779
You'd probably prefer me to talk about politics

909
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,949
and love, but you're not here to stop me.

910
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:22,159
You traveled the world and fell in love

911
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,240
everywhere.

912
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,929
What and who and how did you love?

913
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:30,590
I think there are five answers.

914
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:34,010
You loved places he loved visually.

915
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,260
You believed in the chivalry.

916
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,959
Love does if it was

917
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,960
a waltz.

918
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:44,089
You are an omnivorous lover and you felt

919
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:46,190
the guilt and end of love.

920
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,410
Let's start with your love of places

921
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,799
and this place, Arizona.

922
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,709
When you lived here, you didn't go for walks, but

923
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,750
you seem to have loved the sunshine

924
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:05,039
crayon on watercolor paper.

925
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,260
The opposite of that totalitarian spotlight.

926
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,138
Chalk and paint and felt to pen to conjure

927
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,030
a storm over the Red Rocks.

928
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,929
The first place you loved was Grand

929
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,899
Detour, Illinois, your father,

930
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,370
Dick. It took you traveling on

931
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:35,540
this hotel there.

932
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,556
Dick built a ballroom on the first floor and

933
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:43,400
you recalled sneaking up there at night

934
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,679
in the moonlight and dancing

935
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:50,809
and you had a hut across from it.

936
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:53,869
Who's your arch to do it when you were a boy at

937
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,059
it in the bottom left of this picture?

938
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:57,090
Awesome.

939
00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:59,630
Did you know the hotel burned down?

940
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:02,199
Look what's there now.

941
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,710
He called grandaughter one of those lost

942
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:13,599
worlds. One of those etten's

943
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,610
that you get thrown out of.

944
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:23,530
Look awesome.

945
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,030
It's still a kind of Eden.

946
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:29,480
Your first love.

947
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,559
For the rest of your life, you talked about places

948
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,569
of pre-industrial innocence.

949
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,840
Mary Englands you often call them.

950
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,770
Timeless places of joy, unspoilt

951
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:45,559
nature and love.

952
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,420
I hate to do this to yourson, but here's another

953
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,030
Eden, a snowy Eden in

954
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,969
'Citizen Kane' and building like the Sheffield

955
00:54:57,970 --> 00:54:58,970
Hotel.

956
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,966
Be careful, Joe, blow your muffler

957
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,120
around your neck.

958
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:09,499
I think will have to tell him now.

959
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:11,070
Yes.

960
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:13,900
I'll sign those papers now that

961
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,219
people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.

962
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:19,889
Parents are doing as yours did in

963
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:21,749
the Sheffield Co..

964
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,629
I don't see why we can't raise our own son just

965
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:27,650
because of the money he met with mischance.

966
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,260
Your film Chimes at Midnight was part set

967
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,350
in such an Eden.

968
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:34,050
The Boar's Head Tavern.

969
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,469
You love to have actors, swell women and

970
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:38,470
laughter.

971
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,020
It was a labyrinth.

972
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:42,989
This pleasure dome is playpen.

973
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:46,469
And you designed and oversaw the painting of it

974
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:47,530
yourself.

975
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,306
The place from your unconscious in

976
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:52,079
which you wake up as Falstaff.

977
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,070
Here's where you shot some of the Boar's Head

978
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,199
Tavern scenes in Spain.

979
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,809
Another one of your beloved places.

980
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:10,969
This guy was in the film and still lives here.

981
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,090
What other places did you love?

982
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:20,889
Three hundred and nineteen West 14th Street,

983
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:22,948
Manhattan, where you lived with your first

984
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,500
wife, Virginia.

985
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,069
It's Gothic and your drawing.

986
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:30,280
But guess what? Orson it's still here.

987
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:35,190
You said that it had space charm,

988
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:36,829
electric icebox, garden and all

989
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:39,810
for fifty five dollars a month.

990
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,479
Virginia's having the time of our life here.

991
00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:45,260
A real home. And all the rest of it.

992
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:49,469
With Virginia, you had your first daughter, Chris.

993
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:54,070
And in The Magnificent Ambersons, there's another

994
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:56,629
Paradice Christmas

995
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:59,260
kind of scene with bells on the same track.

996
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:03,320
The snow was a blanket and the clarinet.

997
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:08,900
All right.

998
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,000
There already is about.

999
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,770
There's no bags of other bags.

1000
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,214
Only in a studio could such an idealized scene

1001
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:17,690
be shot.

1002
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:21,849
And that's what you used, the biggest ice box

1003
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:22,989
in Los Angeles.

1004
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,969
It was on this corner, but it's gone now.

1005
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,639
This part of downtown L.A.

1006
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:33,789
is now one of the most deprived the U.S..

1007
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,300
Paradises don't last.

1008
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:45,548
The second aspect of your love life is how

1009
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,739
visual it was when

1010
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,809
you were 17. You saw this film

1011
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:53,150
2N Del Rio Swims Naked.

1012
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:56,719
You fell in love with her visually and

1013
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:59,450
later became her lover in real life.

1014
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:03,340
The man in this scene is Joel McCrea.

1015
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,537
But the imagery sums up your love

1016
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:09,770
life, staring obsessive

1017
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:13,010
love at first glance, moonlit

1018
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:15,470
and flickering. To capture the look of love.

1019
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:17,869
What looking feels like.

1020
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:25,140
You and Dolores.

1021
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,069
Beatrice says that she was the true love of your

1022
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:29,070
life.

1023
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,400
And the lady from Shanghai.

1024
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,399
A camera glided towards another of your loves.

1025
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:37,630
Rita Hayworth.

1026
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,599
It was your eyes.

1027
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:44,000
You saw her on the cover of Life magazine

1028
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,650
and immediately pledged to marry her

1029
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:49,260
dearest little loved one.

1030
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:50,290
You wrote, I love

1031
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:53,369
you more tonight than ever.

1032
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,030
Really? Really.

1033
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:56,260
Even more.

1034
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:01,369
And how's this for the look of love?

1035
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:07,099
You move in again, the point

1036
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,100
of view of a kiss.

1037
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:21,519
A change

1038
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:25,939
in her skills on return of.

1039
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,670
Framed on one of your famed diagnose.

1040
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,319
Then you seem summoned from below.

1041
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:43,760
Drawn by her tractor beam,

1042
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:48,953
your makeup artist wanted to put beads of sweat

1043
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:51,889
on her beret, but you said horses

1044
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:54,020
sweat. Rita glows.

1045
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:04,344
She kept her love letters, notes in her makeup

1046
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:06,189
books for years.

1047
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:14,139
With Rita, of course, you had your second

1048
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:15,429
daughter, Rebecca.

1049
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:21,189
You cast your third wife, Paola,

1050
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,880
as your daughter.

1051
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,559
Mr. Clinton, Morsan

1052
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,900
film about a powerful man with a mysterious past.

1053
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:32,050
I want to speak to my father.

1054
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:34,989
Have you see? Can you give Pilar these concerned

1055
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:35,990
close-ups?

1056
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:39,539
She hears that her father was less than he seeming

1057
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,440
away. Tell him it's too late.

1058
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,520
Too late.

1059
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,909
His relationship with your mother.

1060
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:52,250
Did he hurt? Oh, he would.

1061
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:53,870
Yes. I mean, how they met.

1062
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:57,020
They were in Phrygian and she was walking

1063
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,650
on the beach and he was with Visconti and

1064
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:01,309
he saw and he said, I got to meet her.

1065
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,189
So she was a young starlet.

1066
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:06,829
And the next day, she got a phone call

1067
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,469
and it was this Conti's assistant

1068
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,783
and said, you know, Mr. Visconti would like for

1069
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,010
you to do a trial.

1070
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:14,940
And she was so excited.

1071
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,989
And of course, SIPTU at rushing over there

1072
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:18,619
earnings that she met Orson Welles.

1073
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:35,189
In 1961, while filming the trial,

1074
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,810
you met. Oh, Yaku da.

1075
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:41,010
She became your long term lover and companion.

1076
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,909
Look how you introduced her in a Hefe for fake

1077
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:50,710
glimpsed, glanced at gold

1078
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:54,209
long lens, the center of a network

1079
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,290
of men's looks.

1080
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:03,390
An eye opener.

1081
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,469
No scene in your film is more about looking

1082
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,749
in splinters and seductions.

1083
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:11,790
The look of love as a mosaic.

1084
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,609
So you loved places, Orson, and you loved

1085
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:19,980
visually.

1086
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,699
The third aspect of your love life

1087
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:26,490
is its attraction to chivalry.

1088
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:37,389
The millennium old idea of the chivalrous

1089
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,320
knight in love is so archaic,

1090
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,469
so like a faded pencil.

1091
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:49,390
Lantle, look, I'm gonna be a Syrian led

1092
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,060
to the Middle Ages.

1093
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,719
But more than most artists of the 20th century

1094
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:57,329
have filled in the line drawings.

1095
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:05,390
You believed in these samurai, these

1096
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,900
courtiers who behaved with honor.

1097
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:11,559
By the rules of love and courtship from the era

1098
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:14,199
of the Magna Carta, the myths held

1099
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,559
true for centuries.

1100
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:18,674
One of the best interviews you give to Bernard

1101
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,380
Levin was not only takes this further, you're

1102
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:23,739
leaning forward again on the subject

1103
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,719
and in profile at first.

1104
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:28,300
And I'm rather fond of chivalry and honor.

1105
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:30,859
And I I

1106
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,030
to use it to the hackneyed

1107
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:37,400
drugstore psychiatry word.

1108
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:40,239
I identify with Quixote to the extent

1109
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:43,360
that I am interested in outmoded virtues,

1110
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:48,129
the virtues of chivalry and yes, on

1111
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:50,969
personal honor and courage and things like that.

1112
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,749
Well, you're clearly a romantic.

1113
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:53,849
Whatever else you want.

1114
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:56,460
As much as it is, I think it

1115
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:58,804
is. Aren't you a romantic in a very unromantic

1116
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:00,550
time, you guess?

1117
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:01,989
Do you feel out of your time?

1118
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:05,032
Oh, yes, but I don't think every self-respecting

1119
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:06,530
artist talked to.

1120
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:10,869
Which brings us awesome to the most out of time

1121
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:13,599
night in your art, an absurd

1122
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:16,239
but glorious man who rails against

1123
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:18,437
everything and doesn't seem to realize that

1124
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:20,589
chivalry is long dead.

1125
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:25,179
He was one of your obsessions, this man.

1126
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,469
He made what you called a home movie.

1127
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,469
But Don Quixote and his sidekick, Squire

1128
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:33,588
Central Panter, others will cheer you from

1129
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:35,110
the window.

1130
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:37,450
You filmed the dawn against the sky, his

1131
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:39,269
head in the clouds

1132
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,010
giving up the princess.

1133
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,420
But you are

1134
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:48,090
not only a bit.

1135
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:50,309
And here's a woman which tells us something about

1136
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:52,719
the dawn and the love he

1137
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:54,410
thinks the woman gets.

1138
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:56,520
Paola has been kidnaped

1139
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:58,090
by the vestberg.

1140
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:00,270
Who? This lunatic.

1141
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,110
Don't get updated. I'm on shock.

1142
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:03,389
Knight errant than ever.

1143
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:05,369
The gallant knight. He wants to rescue her.

1144
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:07,620
This isn't your editing, of course.

1145
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:09,030
You never finished the film.

1146
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:12,239
But does the moment capture some of the energy you

1147
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,039
wanted? The absurdity,

1148
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:17,579
but also Don's desire to

1149
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:18,810
do the right thing.

1150
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:20,699
You treat your liver.

1151
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:23,520
That's not a promise you'll go to.

1152
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,309
Oh, I don't know.

1153
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:34,794
And in your painting, the Dons head is against

1154
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:36,300
the sun.

1155
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:38,130
Like Icarus.

1156
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:41,320
Such a delicate man in your painting,

1157
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:42,910
he'll be burnt.

1158
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:46,749
The dawn doesn't look at Central Pend.

1159
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:50,349
In the book and film, they bicker.

1160
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,400
But you have them joined at the hip.

1161
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:58,239
They're on the road of life together, opposites

1162
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:00,969
but indivisible, yin and yang,

1163
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:04,809
your essential Penza is thick smears

1164
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:06,219
at the Donze Elbel.

1165
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,489
A blur to him in some ways.

1166
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:15,516
And love in other ways, you relish

1167
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:17,700
this.

1168
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:22,139
The thickness of their story.

1169
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:27,270
Their themes, their history.

1170
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:32,090
The novel's author, 70s, set out to mock

1171
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:34,556
chivalry, but ended up celebrating

1172
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:36,620
it.

1173
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:39,091
Maybe Laurel and Hardy were the knights

1174
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:40,850
of your time.

1175
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,383
And your one painting of a bullfighter is night

1176
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:46,570
like.

1177
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,951
He's a slayer in a swirl of light, like

1178
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:53,590
your son George with his dragon against the sun,

1179
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:56,500
like Don Quixote, his head Lord,

1180
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:59,200
as if in prayer at his own violence.

1181
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:08,010
The figure in your arc that you loved most

1182
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,919
was another night, but a penniless one

1183
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:14,219
who lived in the boar's head, one of your Eden's.

1184
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:18,139
On the Dean Martin Show, you painted him in a way,

1185
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:21,050
but the canvass was your own face.

1186
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:23,360
You might call a swinger.

1187
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,170
Late 18th century.

1188
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:34,010
They didn't call him swingers, but they swung.

1189
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:39,359
And nobody more so than Sir John.

1190
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:49,010
Your intensity, if

1191
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,979
we get to speak, is if you're lost in the

1192
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:51,980
transformation.

1193
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:57,909
You're a funny man, he was a fat man.

1194
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:02,120
He was a great man then Shakespearean

1195
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:04,919
language with.

1196
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,120
He said himself.

1197
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:11,040
You was not only Widdy and MSL.

1198
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:15,530
At the cause, which was in other men.

1199
01:08:16,939 --> 01:08:18,330
A huge chill about

1200
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:20,889
this town of man.

1201
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,869
This Reverend Feis.

1202
01:08:27,399 --> 01:08:28,779
Gray and equidae

1203
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:31,329
then eatin' again.

1204
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:34,189
He was a spokesman.

1205
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:36,929
You might say for marrying

1206
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:39,819
the old Mary England of

1207
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,739
Maine mornings and Midsummer Eves.

1208
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:48,350
And even villainy was innocent.

1209
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:56,066
And of course, she filmed Falstaff Chimes at

1210
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:57,430
midnight.

1211
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,089
Your drawings for the Battle of Shrewsbury

1212
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:03,880
sequence are a gallery of horsemen

1213
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:05,270
of chevallier

1214
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:07,910
compan.

1215
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:12,029
Colored brush and pen.

1216
01:09:18,899 --> 01:09:21,600
This swiftest in the best brush

1217
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:22,660
only.

1218
01:09:26,649 --> 01:09:29,259
In Poe's and concision, it's as good as

1219
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:30,260
this.

1220
01:09:39,149 --> 01:09:41,579
This bed scene in Chimes at midnight, which you

1221
01:09:41,729 --> 01:09:44,519
don't hear shit, Prince Howe and his friend

1222
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:47,350
Nail points his remarkable recovery.

1223
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:50,789
You get up and move left and then

1224
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:53,950
a swirl of movement like a 60s love-in.

1225
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,910
I owe her money. Whether she'd be dead for that,

1226
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:57,940
I don't know.

1227
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:01,979
Might not fall anyway.

1228
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:03,689
Like a Tintoretto painting.

1229
01:10:05,490 --> 01:10:07,793
Like you, he like to have people almost roll in

1230
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:09,010
the foreground.

1231
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:11,010
He looked up at the world.

1232
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:17,630
He's about everybody in bed.

1233
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,520
The camaraderie of love,

1234
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:23,079
the beds here is another Eden

1235
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,689
of I was there is Beatrice.

1236
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:28,789
All right. Felt good about you.

1237
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:32,480
And it brings us to the fourth aspect of your love

1238
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:35,159
life after place, visual

1239
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,890
ality and chivalry.

1240
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,080
How omnivorous you were.

1241
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:43,991
Your relationships with the man you loved weren't

1242
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:46,689
sexual, but it sounds as if they

1243
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:48,880
were as intense as those with women.

1244
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:51,710
Your letters are full of ardent love for

1245
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:53,380
male friends.

1246
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:55,900
You adored use of cotton, didn't you?

1247
01:10:57,130 --> 01:10:59,020
Can I mention John Heisman?

1248
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:03,899
Here in New York in December 1934,

1249
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:05,259
age 19.

1250
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:08,160
You were playing Tybalt and Romeo and Juliet.

1251
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:12,539
A British Romanian grain merchant turned

1252
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:15,090
theater producer came to see the show.

1253
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,080
It was Heisman.

1254
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:21,720
He called your performance obscene, terrible

1255
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:24,960
and driven by some irresistible interior

1256
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:26,020
violence.

1257
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:29,841
He visited your dressing room and found

1258
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:31,510
you half naked.

1259
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:34,409
The two of you went outside to a nearby bar.

1260
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,319
Your dedicated biographer, Simon Callow,

1261
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:39,479
says you wooed Iceman.

1262
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:42,270
You said that he fell in love with you.

1263
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:45,479
It was part of a pattern.

1264
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:49,729
You seem to become addicted to Jack Carter,

1265
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,219
the actor who played the lead in your voodoo

1266
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:53,220
Macbeth.

1267
01:11:54,230 --> 01:11:56,539
You threw your arms around him crying with

1268
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:58,550
gratitude. According to Houseman.

1269
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,693
You wooed him and went carousing with

1270
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:03,859
him in the bars of Harlem.

1271
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:06,788
You loved as passionately as a bullfighter

1272
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:08,670
fights.

1273
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:13,529
But of course, the bull fight ends and death.

1274
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:19,509
Which brings us to the last aspect of your love

1275
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:22,029
life. Guilt and the death of

1276
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:23,030
love.

1277
01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:24,589
Even Thomas is badass.

1278
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:29,030
Give me the.

1279
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,919
The lady from Shanghai.

1280
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:32,763
Again, you and Rita look purposefully

1281
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:36,470
ahead, but she steers.

1282
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:42,859
I was taught to think about love in Chinese,

1283
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:46,880
the way a Frenchman thinks about laughter

1284
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:48,060
French.

1285
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:50,569
The Chinese say.

1286
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:54,020
It is difficult for love to last long.

1287
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:57,170
Therefore, one who loves passionately

1288
01:12:58,090 --> 01:12:59,090
is cured.

1289
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,029
That's a hard way of thinking.

1290
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,759
But it seems borne out by your love life.

1291
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:06,790
Awesome.

1292
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:09,300
It was full of guilt and sadness.

1293
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:12,750
Your relationship with Heyworth quickly waned.

1294
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:15,780
You draw yourself crying.

1295
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:18,539
And in one of your most surprising images

1296
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,920
also for Haber's, you have a devil visit

1297
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:23,610
you in her absence.

1298
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:26,879
You had affairs is the devil.

1299
01:13:26,930 --> 01:13:29,760
Your guilt or your guilt and sadness

1300
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:30,790
combined.

1301
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:33,989
He called this pencil and watercolor sketch with

1302
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:36,859
its miserable sun, another self

1303
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:38,850
portrait of self-pity.

1304
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:43,510
And how about this?

1305
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:51,120
You're far from Eden here.

1306
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:53,789
The smoke from the factories gathers to show

1307
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:54,790
your mood.

1308
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:02,850
In 168th. And then there's this drawing of Bhola,

1309
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:05,250
right, pregnant and she's had a horrible

1310
01:14:05,390 --> 01:14:08,090
pregnancy. She must be a bitch and

1311
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:09,829
pregnant with you. Yeah.

1312
01:14:11,630 --> 01:14:13,688
I feel lousy is one of your most ambiguous

1313
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:15,300
drawings, Orson.

1314
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:19,040
Are you just recording Paolo's feeling bad

1315
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:22,669
or empathizing with it or mirroring

1316
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:25,460
it? Is it you that feels bad?

1317
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:34,689
You showed the death of love.

1318
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:37,300
The perversion of love most visually

1319
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:39,010
awesome in Morocco

1320
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:41,270
and Venice.

1321
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:45,000
You know what I'm going to say, don't you?

1322
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:49,359
A fellow sufferer,

1323
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:52,050
I know how

1324
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:53,980
bad you.

1325
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,620
A fellow killed Desdemona.

1326
01:14:58,440 --> 01:14:59,840
Facelessness night.

1327
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:01,250
Is murder.

1328
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:03,060
He's blinded by jealousy.

1329
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:05,279
Another margarita painting.

1330
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:21,469
And when she's dead.

1331
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:24,320
This

1332
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:30,028
circle in the ceiling was inspired by this

1333
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:32,859
Montagnier painting and Mantua, wasn't

1334
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:33,860
it?

1335
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:37,239
You had a ceiling built to echo it visually.

1336
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:41,080
And before James Bond films, you liked to circular

1337
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:43,999
ceiling only to be used for Jean

1338
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,960
Vigo cameras low enough to short well to

1339
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,369
hailo him to anti-Hitler him.

1340
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,350
Sophie, what was her last name?

1341
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:52,879
She married years ago.

1342
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:54,349
What's her married name?

1343
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,420
Nothing extenuate, no set down in malice.

1344
01:15:59,850 --> 01:16:00,960
Love as hell.

1345
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,840
Not even to speak.

1346
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:04,939
You had the camera on a scaffold here.

1347
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:08,540
Wisely, but.

1348
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:17,509
Is that how you loved not wisely,

1349
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:18,540
but too well?

1350
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:23,560
But love doesn't just perish naturally.

1351
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:25,561
In Shakespeare's play, it's poisoned by

1352
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:28,779
Jagow whispering gossip in the murder

1353
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:30,069
of fellow's ear.

1354
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,810
You talked well in filming Othello.

1355
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:36,640
It's like an art critic.

1356
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:39,339
Does the film was more an illustrated lecture

1357
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:40,390
than a documentary?

1358
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:43,270
The visual style of the film

1359
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:45,446
mirrors the marriage at the center

1360
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,119
of the play, which is not that

1361
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:50,649
also on Desdemona.

1362
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:54,259
The first marriage of or fellow

1363
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:58,259
the either filming Othello

1364
01:16:58,270 --> 01:16:59,887
had a late night film to multiply

1365
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:03,729
like so many, and you were both cautious and

1366
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:06,220
bold and how you discussed your film

1367
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:07,569
and used clips.

1368
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:09,879
Now the grandeur and simplicity

1369
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:11,645
are the more the dizzying

1370
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:16,779
camera movements, the tortured compositions,

1371
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:19,359
the grotesque shadows and insane

1372
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:20,390
distortion.

1373
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:24,400
The Argo, he is the

1374
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,739
agent of chaos.

1375
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,159
Jagow torpedoes the marriage with gossip.

1376
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:34,560
You did it with style.

1377
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:37,830
The death of love.

1378
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:39,180
The back of love.

1379
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:41,149
They're not much fun to talk about.

1380
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:42,180
Are they arson?

1381
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:44,319
I wonder, am I losing you here?

1382
01:17:46,890 --> 01:17:49,095
We're getting on to kingship in a moment, but

1383
01:17:49,310 --> 01:17:50,927
before we do, one more Kord about

1384
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:53,200
passion dying.

1385
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:55,579
It's in chimes at midnight again.

1386
01:17:56,390 --> 01:17:57,800
And you know what's coming, don't you?

1387
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:01,090
The most resonant line in your art.

1388
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:04,409
Here it is in your screenplay in Michigan.

1389
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:08,240
Are you ready to be heartbroken?

1390
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,489
I know the not old man.

1391
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,550
The prince. The boy says to the man

1392
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:17,350
that the dream is over.

1393
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:20,020
Their friendship is over.

1394
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,770
Vertical spears like the Nuremberg searchlights.

1395
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:25,840
Then you break through

1396
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:30,909
the back of the new king year old drinking

1397
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,229
and cavorting, pal.

1398
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:34,540
Bye bye.

1399
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:36,680
Show.

1400
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:41,199
Speak to me by heart.

1401
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:44,949
I know being not old man faltered,

1402
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:45,960
I praise.

1403
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,219
Al White has become a fool

1404
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:55,220
and gesta.

1405
01:18:57,590 --> 01:19:00,439
I have long dreamed of such a kind of man,

1406
01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:04,250
so surface swell, so old

1407
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:07,399
and so profane, but being awake,

1408
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:09,950
I do despise my dream.

1409
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:14,676
Despise this body, wouldn't reject

1410
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:16,770
have been enough?

1411
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:20,600
Shakespeare's pen was a dagger here, a grave

1412
01:19:20,610 --> 01:19:23,209
to keep for the not only an end of

1413
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:25,550
love, but a rewrite of its history.

1414
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:27,808
Till then, I banish thee on pain

1415
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:30,791
of death as I have done the rest for my

1416
01:19:31,490 --> 01:19:34,160
mislead us not to come near

1417
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:36,109
our passing by.

1418
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:37,110
Ten by.

1419
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,270
And Falstaff falls to his knees

1420
01:19:41,570 --> 01:19:43,334
like John Heisman did as he realizes

1421
01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:47,089
he has the power and who can control the

1422
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:50,039
love means and hurls

1423
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,319
exclusion order.

1424
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:53,489
You wanted to be full staff.

1425
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:54,800
Awesome.

1426
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,949
But let's face it, you ask how

1427
01:19:58,070 --> 01:19:59,449
qualities give you?

1428
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:06,539
The prince, the night

1429
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,425
loving a lot, but in your

1430
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:10,720
exhilaration.

1431
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:13,619
Moving on to other loves, other

1432
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:14,620
worlds.

1433
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:17,550
So we move on to our next world.

1434
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:19,469
Oh, the decent people in your life and work.

1435
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,169
Awesome. Your mother, your head teacher,

1436
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:24,810
Michael O'Hara and the lady from Shanghai.

1437
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:27,989
Joseph Cotton's character, Jedediah Leland.

1438
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:29,340
And 'Citizen Kane'.

1439
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:30,940
Don Quixote.

1440
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,790
Charlton Heston's Character and 'Touch of Evil'.

1441
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:36,060
Sir John Falstaff.

1442
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:40,439
These knights and pongs are often exemplary

1443
01:21:40,710 --> 01:21:41,710
and right.

1444
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:45,540
But there's another type of person excited you

1445
01:21:45,630 --> 01:21:46,630
more.

1446
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:50,194
Dove deeper into your unconscious and you find

1447
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,640
him there.

1448
01:21:54,370 --> 01:21:57,020
This creature from the Black Lagoon, he

1449
01:21:57,070 --> 01:21:59,050
is, of course, the king.

1450
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,260
You mocked the king and chimes at midnight.

1451
01:22:08,710 --> 01:22:10,800
You can't even get up onto his throne.

1452
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,364
He has a port for a crown and speaks

1453
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:15,630
like John Gielgud.

1454
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:22,520
I do not only marvel well,

1455
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:23,710
I'll spend say, time.

1456
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:26,460
So was a.

1457
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:30,539
But you were attracted to the grandeur of

1458
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:31,540
kingship.

1459
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:36,869
Admited awesome.

1460
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:39,109
Your tastes were regal.

1461
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:43,499
Is it true that the director, Richard Fleischer,

1462
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,440
once accused you of treating a lowly photographer

1463
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:48,060
as if you are royalty?

1464
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:49,680
I am royalty.

1465
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:51,220
You barked back.

1466
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:56,449
He used to say that you're a king actor.

1467
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:00,719
And you were fascinated by Latvian gun runner

1468
01:23:00,970 --> 01:23:03,369
and friend of Nazis himura and Gehring.

1469
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:06,430
His name was Michael OLIEN in this time

1470
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:08,770
in this mansion designed by Rafaelle.

1471
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:13,419
He should have played Napoleon or

1472
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:14,529
Henry the eighth.

1473
01:23:17,610 --> 01:23:20,279
Actor Geraldine Fitzgerald said that you were like

1474
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:22,739
a lighthouse when you were

1475
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:23,939
and has been.

1476
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,700
He was utterly dazzling.

1477
01:23:26,370 --> 01:23:28,477
When the beam moves on, you're plunged into

1478
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:29,920
darkness.

1479
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:37,789
Kinship. In your work is visual about

1480
01:23:37,790 --> 01:23:40,399
lawmaking, suffocating,

1481
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:43,219
isolating and about ambition,

1482
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:46,580
totalitarianism, corruption

1483
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,360
and madness.

1484
01:23:49,910 --> 01:23:51,319
Let's take a visual first.

1485
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:52,380
Awesome.

1486
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:55,699
Most aspects of your visual style were extravagant

1487
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,189
as we saw in the porn section.

1488
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:00,380
You had moments of realism in your work.

1489
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,458
But you mostly rejected them, you famously

1490
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:06,739
walked out of this film, Lucchino Visconti's

1491
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:08,630
Neorealist LEITHEAD A tremor.

1492
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:12,807
It's hard to imagine you doing a simple pan

1493
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,280
like this.

1494
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:18,859
Shoulder height to show a fisherman

1495
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:20,159
scene. Naturally,

1496
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:23,479
this was more your style.

1497
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,354
Macbeth at Distant Castle.

1498
01:24:26,210 --> 01:24:27,760
Misty MiddleGround.

1499
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:39,149
It's like Charles Foster Keynes isolated castle.

1500
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:44,880
Castles fired your imagination.

1501
01:24:45,930 --> 01:24:47,580
Especially if they were crumbling.

1502
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:52,749
This etching of yours looks like there's been a

1503
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:53,750
fire.

1504
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:56,979
You had an eye on Piran Azeez imaginary prison

1505
01:24:56,980 --> 01:24:59,109
sketches of the seventeen hundreds.

1506
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:10,249
The land you like to use most 18.5

1507
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:11,659
was a king land.

1508
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:15,020
You could say it made the world bulge

1509
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:17,840
the is the marble, it is the rock.

1510
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:20,223
You slung at low, of course, to make four grand

1511
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:23,239
people massive cramped

1512
01:25:23,570 --> 01:25:26,200
confinement bound into

1513
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:27,920
Soshi doubts and fears

1514
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,420
to make patterns between near and far.

1515
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,450
It was expressionists, this lens.

1516
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:42,000
It was good to abstraction between

1517
01:25:42,030 --> 01:25:43,100
classes I took over.

1518
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:46,100
Beyond visual things, King men

1519
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:48,770
are lawmakers and law breakers.

1520
01:25:49,790 --> 01:25:52,669
That lends again a seated king,

1521
01:25:53,150 --> 01:25:55,960
an insolent press baron Arsdale JUILA.

1522
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,040
You provide the prose poems.

1523
01:25:58,190 --> 01:26:00,280
I'll provide the war that

1524
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:02,489
I like to write.

1525
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:05,689
And here in your late film, The Immortal Story,

1526
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:08,570
you're a king of sorts in a carriage.

1527
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,869
The running man is a sailor you've just picked up.

1528
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,569
You'll pay him to have sex with a woman.

1529
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,729
You're a Benny king making

1530
01:26:18,730 --> 01:26:21,010
the rules, setting down the law,

1531
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,829
treating others like the homes

1532
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,552
you arrived, where the sex has to happen in your

1533
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:36,129
own home in Madrid.

1534
01:26:36,190 --> 01:26:37,190
Awesome.

1535
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:41,411
And here's your Hank Quinlan and 'Touch of Evil'

1536
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:45,270
barely first, then looming above the camera,

1537
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:47,819
then a whale's in body twist.

1538
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:52,489
He's a king in his own mind, a detective.

1539
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:56,120
He thinks the laws for little people, for poems,

1540
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:58,939
not for him, he's above the law

1541
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:00,899
and bend to his will.

1542
01:27:05,150 --> 01:27:07,459
Beyond their visual and legal lives,

1543
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:11,119
your kings are often suffocated or imprisoned.

1544
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:13,729
They're trapped inside their castles.

1545
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:20,369
They can't escape their own power,

1546
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:22,859
their own thoughts.

1547
01:27:25,470 --> 01:27:26,939
Their echo chambers.

1548
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:33,079
Beatrice tells us this was painted in frustration

1549
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:35,637
at the Universal Film Studios, stopping you

1550
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,060
completing 'Touch of Evil'.

1551
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,939
It's an isolation picture, too, isn't it?

1552
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:42,859
Appear uneasy in the desert.

1553
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:46,249
You were the king forced to abdicate.

1554
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:09,109
Intense visuals, a man above the law.

1555
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:10,620
Isolation.

1556
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:12,680
You know where this is leading, I'm sure.

1557
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:15,140
To Scotland. And your film?

1558
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:16,260
Macbeth.

1559
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:25,770
It first imagined my bath in your teens

1560
01:28:26,030 --> 01:28:28,649
in this drawing and your everybody's Shakespeare

1561
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:30,169
book and we've seen your Voodoo

1562
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:33,779
Macbeth of 1936.

1563
01:28:35,930 --> 01:28:37,220
Just nine years later.

1564
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:39,979
What a long nine years they must have seemed

1565
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:43,129
two marriages, WOR radio stardom,

1566
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:45,109
Hollywood fame for films.

1567
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:48,859
You were filming it on the cheap for a B movie

1568
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:49,860
studio.

1569
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:53,574
You imagined the film's landscape with angular

1570
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:55,129
trees against the sky.

1571
01:28:58,060 --> 01:29:00,420
The film would be shot quickly in the studio.

1572
01:29:00,930 --> 01:29:02,899
So you came up with this main set.

1573
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:08,309
Scotland can sometimes look like a production.

1574
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:09,600
Designers had a hand in it.

1575
01:29:13,170 --> 01:29:16,049
The characters were to be horned like cattle

1576
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:17,230
or rams.

1577
01:29:18,870 --> 01:29:20,310
It was your most graphic film.

1578
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:23,789
The witches pagan symbols that

1579
01:29:23,790 --> 01:29:26,142
set it looked like something you'd see in a fish

1580
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:29,350
tank, an underwater Macbeth.

1581
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:31,969
Perhaps your

1582
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:33,329
contrasts were violent

1583
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:37,729
slo mo mist then dissolve

1584
01:29:37,730 --> 01:29:38,760
to this Close-Up.

1585
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:42,696
One of the most contrasty images in American

1586
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:44,510
film.

1587
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:47,939
Then we're behind the head of Macbeth.

1588
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:51,149
This king whose ambition is detestable,

1589
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:54,209
this Hank Quinlan, the Stellan.

1590
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:55,780
This Foust

1591
01:30:05,730 --> 01:30:07,886
the real world seemed to enter the film as a

1592
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:09,100
nightmare.

1593
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,989
Macbeth.. So in the shadow of himself

1594
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:17,449
that he doesn't even realize that he's free.

1595
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:20,699
He feels railroaded by the witches prophecy.

1596
01:30:21,730 --> 01:30:24,189
He's a slave to his own lust for power.

1597
01:30:25,390 --> 01:30:27,939
You've dived so deep nigh that you're in the land

1598
01:30:27,940 --> 01:30:28,940
of the surreal.

1599
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:32,220
The colonnade.

1600
01:30:32,770 --> 01:30:34,810
It's like a Caraco nightmare painting.

1601
01:30:34,850 --> 01:30:35,850
Orson.

1602
01:30:38,910 --> 01:30:41,260
At least categorize lable image in macbeth.

1603
01:30:41,530 --> 01:30:44,109
and in all your art, I think is

1604
01:30:44,110 --> 01:30:45,460
the shot. Awesome.

1605
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:48,699
It looks like Klyde scene from an airplane.

1606
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:53,039
Or an archipelago with a colossus ending

1607
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,040
in it.

1608
01:30:54,340 --> 01:30:55,340
Turtle.

1609
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:05,209
Macbeth's one of the few films I wanted to draw

1610
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:06,300
as I watched.

1611
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,689
The fourth aspect of your kingship is its

1612
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:15,479
totalitarianism and corruption.

1613
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:19,520
These themes are in Sezer, of course,

1614
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:22,633
and in your Cesare a Borgia and the film Prince

1615
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:25,429
of Foxes draw a map of all he

1616
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:26,704
conquers the King, actors,

1617
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:29,819
big shoulders and flowing gun.

1618
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,160
The ultimate goal.

1619
01:31:31,940 --> 01:31:32,940
Wanted to.

1620
01:31:34,390 --> 01:31:36,759
One kingdom, one king

1621
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:38,240
shares a border.

1622
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:41,700
You made Prince of Foxes in the same year.

1623
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:44,370
You played your most corrupt character,

1624
01:31:44,730 --> 01:31:47,810
Harry Lime, who profiteers from penicillin

1625
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:49,350
stolen from hospitals.

1626
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:52,869
He famously talks of the Borgias as

1627
01:31:52,890 --> 01:31:55,709
you casually put on gloves and the camera lines

1628
01:31:55,740 --> 01:31:58,310
in what the fella sends

1629
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,170
naturally for 30 years under the Borgias.

1630
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:04,080
They had warfare, terror, murder, bloodshed,

1631
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:06,749
but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci

1632
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:08,840
and the Renaissance in Switzerland.

1633
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:10,060
Brotherly love.

1634
01:32:10,890 --> 01:32:13,470
500 years of democracy and peace.

1635
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:14,760
And what did that produce?

1636
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:16,740
The cuckoo clock.

1637
01:32:17,510 --> 01:32:18,931
Call it a scene you wrote, of

1638
01:32:20,010 --> 01:32:22,949
course, cinema's most famous strike

1639
01:32:23,220 --> 01:32:24,959
of the authoritarian bell.

1640
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,329
In the late 1930s, before 'Citizen Kane',

1641
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:34,088
you were to make a film about an even more

1642
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:37,079
dangerous man, ivory trader.

1643
01:32:37,130 --> 01:32:39,709
KURTZ And Joseph Conrad's novella,

1644
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:40,850
Heart of Darkness.

1645
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:47,109
Here's your sketch of the compound where he lives

1646
01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:49,510
in 1938.

1647
01:32:49,670 --> 01:32:51,880
You adapted to darkness for radio.

1648
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,309
You played Kurtz, of course, and tried to

1649
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:57,310
capture his genius, his panic,

1650
01:32:57,640 --> 01:32:58,640
his tyranny.

1651
01:32:59,590 --> 01:33:01,790
A way of life is weird

1652
01:33:02,230 --> 01:33:04,209
enough to effectively back my station

1653
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:06,320
freshies mine.

1654
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:09,999
I have no right to take me away.

1655
01:33:11,010 --> 01:33:13,869
Bank manager Lubitsch

1656
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:16,499
Yojimbo wants my hobby.

1657
01:33:17,220 --> 01:33:18,520
His Verloc major.

1658
01:33:18,670 --> 01:33:20,620
Why? Don't excite yourself.

1659
01:33:21,570 --> 01:33:22,570
You're

1660
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:25,900
sick,

1661
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:30,340
not so sick if you'd like to believe.

1662
01:33:33,090 --> 01:33:35,729
Heart of darkness is set during one of the worst

1663
01:33:35,730 --> 01:33:36,869
human atrocities.

1664
01:33:36,910 --> 01:33:39,419
Orson Belgium's colonization

1665
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:40,420
of the Congo.

1666
01:33:41,370 --> 01:33:44,149
KURTZ was for you a fascist

1667
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,160
king.

1668
01:33:45,980 --> 01:33:48,620
That's the end of the king line, in a way.

1669
01:33:49,070 --> 01:33:52,489
Except for one more thing, the madness

1670
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:53,580
of kingship.

1671
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:57,890
In 1953, you played King Lear

1672
01:33:58,040 --> 01:33:59,329
live on TV.

1673
01:34:00,410 --> 01:34:02,949
That lolking angle, that roaring

1674
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,029
king of voice,

1675
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:16,579
he says, Oh, let me not be mad.

1676
01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:18,229
Not mad, sweet heaven.

1677
01:34:20,630 --> 01:34:23,300
But he's driven by the burdens of power

1678
01:34:23,390 --> 01:34:24,390
and family.

1679
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:30,920
The camera pulls out and lightning

1680
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:32,659
and that expressionism again.

1681
01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:43,089
Did you intend this to be Lere Lawson?

1682
01:34:46,710 --> 01:34:49,589
It's like it's raining here or it's a lightning

1683
01:34:49,590 --> 01:34:50,590
storm.

1684
01:34:52,710 --> 01:34:54,866
You did Christopher Marlowe's first on stage

1685
01:34:55,330 --> 01:34:56,590
in 1937.

1686
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:58,826
You heard him say, I refused to be

1687
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:02,289
insane. I do not claim the sanctuary

1688
01:35:02,290 --> 01:35:03,290
of the madhouse.

1689
01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:06,279
Do not think I stumbled into the pit.

1690
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,640
Pray for the free man who damned hymns

1691
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:10,700
of.

1692
01:35:16,810 --> 01:35:18,430
Did you dam yourself?

1693
01:35:18,490 --> 01:35:19,490
Awesome.

1694
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,609
And if so, for what?

1695
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:24,870
Politics.

1696
01:35:27,950 --> 01:35:29,979
Love power.

1697
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:32,030
Glory.

1698
01:35:33,090 --> 01:35:34,090
Excitment.

1699
01:35:34,950 --> 01:35:37,409
Loneliness define

1700
01:35:38,850 --> 01:35:39,850
fury.

1701
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:56,840
Dear mom, I pray

1702
01:35:56,850 --> 01:35:59,589
in your letters when you show

1703
01:35:59,650 --> 01:36:01,850
these unlucky deeds and

1704
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:05,619
speak of me as nothing

1705
01:36:05,630 --> 01:36:06,630
extenuate.

1706
01:36:09,770 --> 01:36:12,770
So the world kept turning

1707
01:36:13,230 --> 01:36:14,659
after high tide.

1708
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:16,669
Who'd have guessed?

1709
01:36:18,510 --> 01:36:21,119
It sounds as if I'd have taken to the

1710
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:22,380
21st century.

1711
01:36:23,790 --> 01:36:24,929
I wasn't tired of living.

1712
01:36:26,010 --> 01:36:27,350
I wasn't tired of Rs.

1713
01:36:29,870 --> 01:36:32,930
In your letter, mark, you'll split

1714
01:36:32,990 --> 01:36:35,089
my politics from my love.

1715
01:36:35,530 --> 01:36:36,830
But the same thing.

1716
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:39,319
Or at least hold the same route.

1717
01:36:40,490 --> 01:36:42,350
You missed how, honey.

1718
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:43,850
I found it all.

1719
01:36:45,220 --> 01:36:48,520
You do know that life is a circus.

1720
01:36:48,730 --> 01:36:49,730
Don't show.

1721
01:36:52,210 --> 01:36:53,919
Beatrice still seems to.

1722
01:36:57,390 --> 01:36:59,459
Was this Martha in your box?

1723
01:37:01,820 --> 01:37:02,820
No.

1724
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:05,759
My ending was the lady from Shanghai

1725
01:37:07,010 --> 01:37:09,600
at a print shop sidewalk

1726
01:37:09,610 --> 01:37:10,799
intending to find.

1727
01:37:14,130 --> 01:37:15,459
Everybody is.

1728
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:16,840
Somebody is cool.

1729
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:20,340
The only way to stay out of trouble is to grow.

1730
01:37:20,490 --> 01:37:22,080
So I guess I'll concentrate on

1731
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:25,070
maybe our lives or long.

1732
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:30,739
Maybe I'm a guy

1733
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,636
that's more important than the ending of the

1734
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:35,950
trial.

1735
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:39,709
And as you're so taken by my drawings.

1736
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:41,089
How about this one

1737
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:44,430
lady would be a woman.

1738
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:47,149
Johnson is not only a brawling,

1739
01:37:47,630 --> 01:37:49,550
bumbling and inept

1740
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:52,179
pursed lips.

1741
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:53,840
I adore her.

1742
01:37:54,430 --> 01:37:55,900
The toffs were their drinkers.

1743
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:58,870
Noses and eyes closed

1744
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:02,569
amidst all the power and politics

1745
01:38:02,570 --> 01:38:04,579
of which you speak. My line ran naturally

1746
01:38:05,210 --> 01:38:06,770
to doodles like this.

1747
01:38:08,660 --> 01:38:10,640
Does he remind you of anyone?

1748
01:38:13,590 --> 01:38:16,290
And several lifetimes ago, before

1749
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,084
Cain, I made a large number of phone

1750
01:38:18,970 --> 01:38:20,520
calls, too much jobs.

1751
01:38:22,270 --> 01:38:25,149
There was a scene where a well-dressed young man

1752
01:38:25,150 --> 01:38:27,729
on police officers had their hats

1753
01:38:27,730 --> 01:38:28,730
removed.

1754
01:38:30,650 --> 01:38:33,279
It was absurd, like a Mack Senate

1755
01:38:33,310 --> 01:38:34,310
comedy.

1756
01:38:40,230 --> 01:38:41,970
That's cluelessness again.

1757
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:43,469
Like so much life.

1758
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:50,109
And since you mention Mr. Archi

1759
01:38:50,850 --> 01:38:53,109
call if you its climax

1760
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:56,359
a stalk of the film like a shadow.

1761
01:38:56,420 --> 01:38:59,390
But the world of my story is absurd.

1762
01:39:00,290 --> 01:39:02,970
Kim's character Zouk was Luster's at its

1763
01:39:03,430 --> 01:39:06,169
peak. If he catches me out here dancing

1764
01:39:06,170 --> 01:39:08,899
around in my arms, does

1765
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:10,550
it remind you of anything?

1766
01:39:11,510 --> 01:39:13,609
Laurel and Hardy, perhaps.

1767
01:39:16,930 --> 01:39:19,689
My camera was usual a low, of course,

1768
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:21,435
but the humanity in Stein and Dolly

1769
01:39:22,510 --> 01:39:24,119
is the same childish.

1770
01:39:24,210 --> 01:39:25,270
The circus.

1771
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:27,679
The comedic de la Punchinello.

1772
01:39:27,910 --> 01:39:30,699
What's new in the UK called Punch and Judy?

1773
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:37,590
I did scores of pictures and sent

1774
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,600
pics.

1775
01:39:40,630 --> 01:39:43,169
There were conventional ones in the red

1776
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,200
and white.

1777
01:39:45,930 --> 01:39:47,530
It come down the chimney.

1778
01:39:47,890 --> 01:39:48,920
I'll be by the fire.

1779
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:55,500
But I remember that as I drew,

1780
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,190
he started to look like he was on the stage

1781
01:39:59,250 --> 01:40:01,689
taking a ball per chance

1782
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:03,239
call.

1783
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:07,242
Those with a keen eye might say I paid

1784
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:10,840
to do more and more, so emerge

1785
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:12,760
with some of the things that I admire.

1786
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:14,814
And he morphed, his colors

1787
01:40:16,390 --> 01:40:19,479
changed, but Red disappeared,

1788
01:40:21,670 --> 01:40:23,770
rather a trunk to his nose.

1789
01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:27,359
UC Santa is becoming a drinker

1790
01:40:27,830 --> 01:40:28,899
like Christmas for

1791
01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:31,390
a drunk.

1792
01:40:33,470 --> 01:40:35,600
Sir John, step

1793
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:39,959
more cards. I did, the more rapid I became,

1794
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:41,430
the colors leached out

1795
01:40:43,210 --> 01:40:45,859
day became night, and this Christmas, Carol

1796
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:46,860
of mine

1797
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:49,890
debacle grow.

1798
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:55,949
And then even the nose was no longer

1799
01:40:55,950 --> 01:40:56,950
red.

1800
01:40:57,790 --> 01:41:00,329
They took on the tone of a lot of my

1801
01:41:00,330 --> 01:41:01,330
work.

1802
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:03,093
Call it dark exuberance, if

1803
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:05,380
you like.

1804
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,369
That's what the lady from Shanghai was.

1805
01:41:09,110 --> 01:41:12,070
I don't like baths, canibus

1806
01:41:13,190 --> 01:41:14,190
and excessive.

1807
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:19,399
I've often said that Cain has the same

1808
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:20,400
tension.

1809
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:25,340
Cain himself is proposed to fast

1810
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:28,489
close to parity, close to burlesque.

1811
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:34,029
That roller coaster you showed was like the great

1812
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:37,279
here in the United

1813
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:38,280
States.

1814
01:41:51,930 --> 01:41:55,020
I was a satirist.

1815
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:57,320
Didn't you see that?

1816
01:42:01,460 --> 01:42:02,930
A was training.

1817
01:42:05,390 --> 01:42:07,310
What happens when it fragos

1818
01:42:08,410 --> 01:42:10,399
absurdity becomes the norm?

1819
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:38,459
The sites and thralls of lust doing spare

1820
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:40,224
hours more thrive than I that spends

1821
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:44,069
her life upon my cause.

1822
01:42:49,180 --> 01:42:51,069
How is Ireland these days?

1823
01:42:52,110 --> 01:42:53,110
Yours, Arsen.

1824
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:26,583
Dear Orson, I just imagined

1825
01:43:27,790 --> 01:43:28,960
that you wrote back to me.

1826
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:30,920
I wish you had.

1827
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:34,459
How do I finish a letter like this?

1828
01:43:36,490 --> 01:43:37,989
Should I mention that there's been another

1829
01:43:37,990 --> 01:43:39,159
financial crash?

1830
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:42,035
Who's a Wall Street screwed up like

1831
01:43:42,850 --> 01:43:44,409
they did in 1929?

1832
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:46,899
This is Kenosha, where you were born.

1833
01:43:47,150 --> 01:43:48,150
No.

1834
01:43:48,670 --> 01:43:50,826
Parts of it looked like a deserted Hollywood

1835
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:51,970
studio, a backlot.

1836
01:43:52,630 --> 01:43:54,770
More images from the 1930s.

1837
01:44:03,650 --> 01:44:05,719
The Great Depression that followed the Wall Street

1838
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:08,000
crash helped form, didn't it?

1839
01:44:08,090 --> 01:44:09,903
Awesome. Will our new depression make

1840
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:11,760
a new awesome?

1841
01:44:21,060 --> 01:44:23,520
Beatrice had an on opened letter from you

1842
01:44:23,940 --> 01:44:25,529
to your guardian Dadda benching.

1843
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:29,061
This letter was written on the 14th of October in

1844
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:31,819
1931 when

1845
01:44:31,820 --> 01:44:33,710
dad was still living in Chicago.

1846
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:35,810
Any of these unopened?

1847
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:41,289
Top man.

1848
01:44:44,050 --> 01:44:46,409
Funny you forgot to post something.

1849
01:44:46,650 --> 01:44:48,179
This is insane.

1850
01:44:49,350 --> 01:44:51,509
We were hoping that there'd be some secret in that

1851
01:44:51,510 --> 01:44:53,078
envelope. PAWSON Some new way of

1852
01:44:54,090 --> 01:44:55,090
seeing you.

1853
01:44:55,170 --> 01:44:56,170
Isn't that why?

1854
01:44:56,850 --> 01:44:59,369
But maybe what was in the box and what's

1855
01:44:59,370 --> 01:45:01,680
in the University of Michigan archive?

1856
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:04,170
There's a bit of a new way of seeing you.

1857
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:05,590
There's nothing in Agnes.

1858
01:45:05,940 --> 01:45:08,549
Your art has made me look again at your life and

1859
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:09,550
work.

1860
01:45:11,450 --> 01:45:13,609
This scene in Mr. Codon, for example.

1861
01:45:13,820 --> 01:45:15,859
Oh, it isn't. That's what all these crazy

1862
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:16,880
Frankensteins.

1863
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:20,462
Well, you don't understand supposed to

1864
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:22,100
represent the paintings.

1865
01:45:22,370 --> 01:45:24,460
Now some of it comes with visions and monsters.

1866
01:45:24,910 --> 01:45:27,050
Boy, oh, boy.

1867
01:45:27,250 --> 01:45:28,250
Glad to meet you.

1868
01:45:29,290 --> 01:45:31,250
It's a Goya painting with an added bench

1869
01:45:31,930 --> 01:45:33,459
of Tusa from sternbergh.

1870
01:45:36,460 --> 01:45:39,590
In the same film, this scene near the start

1871
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:42,590
is what graphic certainly

1872
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:45,979
it's a murder and chase moment, but who's

1873
01:45:45,980 --> 01:45:48,529
being shot or why doesn't seem to be

1874
01:45:48,530 --> 01:45:49,909
your main concern.

1875
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:53,840
You're more taken by the steam of the train

1876
01:45:54,350 --> 01:45:56,930
ships within the frame, the angles,

1877
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:58,440
the cubism.

1878
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:05,149
And then the lady from Shanghai, you painted

1879
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:07,230
these sets yourself, didn't you?

1880
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:09,560
And that was not you walk through a lattice

1881
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:13,040
shards, a constructivist design.

1882
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:15,374
If the cops traced it to Grisby like

1883
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:18,289
this one by ALEXANDRA Extern.

1884
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:25,930
And a few scenes later in your hall of mirrors.

1885
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:28,290
We're in the land of my bridge.

1886
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:29,320
Play it your way.

1887
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:32,869
You didn't love panel imagery

1888
01:46:34,230 --> 01:46:35,230
erotic.

1889
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:38,280
In love with lenses.

1890
01:46:42,650 --> 01:46:45,209
And then the lady from Shanghai is like a drawing

1891
01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:46,709
or a knew about her.

1892
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:49,789
She planned to kill Bannister.

1893
01:46:50,490 --> 01:46:51,510
She and Grisby.

1894
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:53,250
Isn't that it?

1895
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:55,949
Is that what's been on the tip of my tongue in

1896
01:46:55,950 --> 01:46:56,950
this letter?

1897
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:01,080
Many of your films are like charcoal drawings,

1898
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:04,140
hair nets and grills are hatchings

1899
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:05,500
shadings.

1900
01:47:11,470 --> 01:47:14,740
Mr. Carden, you used the Segovia Aqueduct

1901
01:47:15,190 --> 01:47:17,000
like an architectural drawing.

1902
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:19,080
Oh, I went.

1903
01:47:27,390 --> 01:47:29,859
As I'm thinking this, I see this scene

1904
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:31,479
in the lady from Shanghai.

1905
01:47:32,590 --> 01:47:34,529
Rita wants her cigaret lit.

1906
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:38,169
Your shot sweeps left with it.

1907
01:47:38,530 --> 01:47:39,850
Mano a mano.

1908
01:47:40,750 --> 01:47:43,239
There's no story need to do this, but there's a

1909
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:45,670
graphic need, a drawing need.

1910
01:47:46,140 --> 01:47:49,010
God will never be too old to earn a salary.

1911
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:51,445
And then the shot comes back again, following

1912
01:47:51,910 --> 01:47:53,020
the cigaret again.

1913
01:47:54,970 --> 01:47:57,669
Two simple moments, but they're like this

1914
01:47:57,670 --> 01:47:58,810
drawing of yours.

1915
01:48:01,610 --> 01:48:02,630
Or this destroying.

1916
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:07,310
That's it.

1917
01:48:07,810 --> 01:48:09,579
That's my light bulb moment.

1918
01:48:09,670 --> 01:48:10,670
Awesome.

1919
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:12,579
That's what's been on the tip of my tongue.

1920
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:14,439
Your visual thinking.

1921
01:48:15,310 --> 01:48:17,890
You thought with lines and shapes,

1922
01:48:18,730 --> 01:48:20,710
your films are sketchbooks.

1923
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:22,600
Calligraphy.

1924
01:48:25,230 --> 01:48:27,435
That's why people who love Laurence Olivier's

1925
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:30,599
literary and psychological Shakespeare films

1926
01:48:30,930 --> 01:48:31,930
don't like yours.

1927
01:48:32,670 --> 01:48:35,820
Yours were rougher and more to do with space

1928
01:48:35,910 --> 01:48:37,290
and graphics and power.

1929
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:41,310
Once I realize this, I discover

1930
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:43,439
that it's sort of said it already.

1931
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:47,189
He told one of your biographers that Macbeth

1932
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:50,069
was a violent charcoal sketch of the play.

1933
01:48:51,380 --> 01:48:54,449
And the Nazi Party's filmmaker, Leni Riefenstahl,

1934
01:48:54,570 --> 01:48:57,240
of all people, wasn't far off

1935
01:48:57,270 --> 01:48:58,789
when she said that Welles draws

1936
01:48:59,970 --> 01:49:01,587
marvelous pictures in the margins

1937
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:03,640
of Shakespeare.

1938
01:49:05,380 --> 01:49:07,144
F for fake was a sketchbook unfolded

1939
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:11,020
paper touch of evals of fresco.

1940
01:49:11,790 --> 01:49:13,719
The trial is like a lino cut

1941
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:17,469
Macbeth. The Lady from Shanghai, Othello

1942
01:49:17,550 --> 01:49:20,109
and Mr. Arkadin scratch at

1943
01:49:20,110 --> 01:49:22,540
their characters like your quill and

1944
01:49:22,630 --> 01:49:25,479
ink scratched in the TV sketches.

1945
01:49:26,870 --> 01:49:29,299
Approximately excitingly,

1946
01:49:29,900 --> 01:49:32,770
but in a way that many find too sharp.

1947
01:49:34,490 --> 01:49:36,401
They make you seem mad for contact with

1948
01:49:37,010 --> 01:49:40,039
the world, taking its fragments roughly

1949
01:49:40,820 --> 01:49:43,369
and absorbing them into yourself to

1950
01:49:43,370 --> 01:49:46,220
make art that jagged and fractured.

1951
01:49:49,630 --> 01:49:52,209
In 1953, you went here,

1952
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:55,629
Edinburgh and Scotland, and made a speech about

1953
01:49:55,630 --> 01:49:57,220
the future of the movies.

1954
01:49:58,750 --> 01:50:01,359
You said that a Hollywood film needs an audience

1955
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:04,090
of 60 million people to break even.

1956
01:50:05,450 --> 01:50:08,600
But you dreamt of smar more distinctive films

1957
01:50:08,990 --> 01:50:11,120
that could speak to 2 million people.

1958
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:15,040
Guess what? Orson from the future.

1959
01:50:15,490 --> 01:50:18,100
I can tell you that your dream is sort of

1960
01:50:18,180 --> 01:50:19,180
country.

1961
01:50:21,450 --> 01:50:23,753
Film technology has changed massively since she

1962
01:50:24,090 --> 01:50:25,090
died.

1963
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:28,520
If many of your films were like sketches,

1964
01:50:29,270 --> 01:50:31,377
if you dreamt of a camera being more like a

1965
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:34,399
pencil, your dream is coming

1966
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:35,400
true.

1967
01:50:36,770 --> 01:50:39,469
More than ever, you can draw with a camera.

1968
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:40,520
No.

1969
01:50:40,950 --> 01:50:43,590
Studio cinema was like history painting.

1970
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:47,310
Knife film is more like oil painting.

1971
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:49,440
And look at this.

1972
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:52,189
An oil painting of, you know,

1973
01:50:52,460 --> 01:50:53,629
it's an accident.

1974
01:50:54,330 --> 01:50:56,899
Our computer didn't copy some footage of you

1975
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:59,630
properly and so it pixelated it

1976
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:02,960
and it looks like Manet or Rembrandt.

1977
01:51:07,810 --> 01:51:10,179
We're back in the 1940s when you were making

1978
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:13,299
'Citizen Kane'. You and cinematographer Gregg

1979
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:14,672
Toland dreamt of a time when

1980
01:51:15,910 --> 01:51:18,489
there would be no film and the camera would be an

1981
01:51:18,580 --> 01:51:19,750
electronic eye.

1982
01:51:20,990 --> 01:51:23,539
That dream has come tree to.

1983
01:51:27,790 --> 01:51:29,929
On the morning of October the 10th, nineteen

1984
01:51:29,930 --> 01:51:31,860
eighty five, you died.

1985
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:37,239
It was said that you were at your typewriter when

1986
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:38,240
it happened.

1987
01:51:38,620 --> 01:51:39,620
This typewriter.

1988
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:43,199
But your life probably ended in your bathroom.

1989
01:51:44,710 --> 01:51:47,589
But still, is this one of the last things

1990
01:51:47,590 --> 01:51:49,452
in the world those great eyes of yours

1991
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:51,520
saw? Awesome.

1992
01:51:54,330 --> 01:51:56,192
If you're alive now, if you were still

1993
01:51:57,090 --> 01:51:59,819
seeing, you could be making so

1994
01:51:59,850 --> 01:52:01,100
many films.

1995
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:06,170
Your archetypes, pond, knights,

1996
01:52:06,350 --> 01:52:09,259
kings and jesters are as relevant

1997
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:10,500
as ever.

1998
01:52:13,510 --> 01:52:15,617
Your friend Kenneth Tynan said when writing

1999
01:52:16,270 --> 01:52:17,642
about you, the B will always

2000
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:20,060
make honey.

2001
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:23,420
What, honey?

2002
01:52:23,530 --> 01:52:24,530
You made.

2003
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:29,810
What, honey? You could have made.

2004
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:35,985
In an interview 1962, you

2005
01:52:37,310 --> 01:52:39,979
said being alive means not

2006
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:42,679
killing the tensions one carries within

2007
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:43,680
oneself.

2008
01:52:44,060 --> 01:52:46,549
On the contrary, support must seek out

2009
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:49,399
and cultivate his contradictions.

2010
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:55,500
Buzzed with contradictions or awesomer,

2011
01:52:56,160 --> 01:52:58,770
you love porn's nights and

2012
01:52:58,790 --> 01:52:59,790
games.

2013
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:04,399
Do I contradict myself?

2014
01:53:04,730 --> 01:53:06,890
Very well, then I contradict.

2015
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:10,279
I am large, I contain

2016
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:11,420
multitudes.

2017
01:53:11,780 --> 01:53:14,359
I, too, am not a bit tamed.

2018
01:53:14,690 --> 01:53:17,510
I, too, am untranslatable.

2019
01:53:17,930 --> 01:53:20,660
I sound my barbaric

2020
01:53:20,900 --> 01:53:21,978
your over the roofs of

2021
01:53:23,540 --> 01:53:24,540
the world.

2022
01:53:28,820 --> 01:53:30,600
We can still hear your sound.

2023
01:53:30,650 --> 01:53:31,650
Awesome.

2024
01:53:31,790 --> 01:53:34,699
And most of all, we can still

2025
01:53:34,790 --> 01:53:36,500
look through your eyes.

2026
01:54:18,010 --> 01:54:20,229
Look, their Sancho Panza, my friend,

2027
01:54:20,530 --> 01:54:23,680
and see those 30 or so wild giants

2028
01:54:24,070 --> 01:54:26,619
with whom I intend to do battle and kill each and

2029
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:27,680
all of them.

2030
01:54:28,660 --> 01:54:31,189
What Giants Ass and Chapin's are

2031
01:54:31,870 --> 01:54:33,310
the ones you can see over there?

2032
01:54:33,370 --> 01:54:36,700
Answered his master with the huge arms.

2033
01:54:37,690 --> 01:54:38,700
Now look, Greece.

2034
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:40,270
It's unsure what you see over.

2035
01:54:40,870 --> 01:54:44,350
There aren't giants, but windmills,

2036
01:54:46,930 --> 01:54:48,969
obviously, replied Don Quixote.

2037
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:52,060
You don't know much about adventures.
