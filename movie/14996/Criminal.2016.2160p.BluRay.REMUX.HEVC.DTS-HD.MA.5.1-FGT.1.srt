1
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,860
他们搞乱我的大脑
They messed with my brain.

2
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,900
他们以为已经得到了他们想要的
Thought they knew what they'd get.

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,330
但他们错了
But they were wrong.

4
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,940
他们不了解我
They don't know me.

5
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,140
我不知道接下来发生了什么，但我敢肯定
I don't know what happens next, but this I do know.

6
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,370
如果你伤害了我，我就加倍奉还
You hurt me, I hurt you worse.

7
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,300
换 脑 行 动

00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,280
比尔波普
中情局驻伦敦特工

9
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,560
借过
Excuse me.

10
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,060
你好，我的妻子上个星期在这...
Hi there. My wife was in last week

11
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,300
订了一个棕色的达尔夫皮包
and she ordered a brown duffle in leather.

12
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,100
先生，我们只进到了黑色款的
We were only able to locate in black, sir.

13
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,360
那么她肯定会很失望
Well, she'll be very disappointed.

14
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,380
Right.

15
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,130
好的，非常感谢
Okay, thank you very much.

16
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,060
- 嘿，吉莉  - 爸爸，我是艾玛
- Hey, Jillie.
- No, Daddy, it's Emma.

17
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,140
我找不到我的宠物玩具
I can't find my Elly.

18
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,420
亲爱的，别担心，会找到的，让妈妈接电话
Hey, baby, we'll find it. Put Mommy on.

19
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,480
妈妈，爸爸的电话
Mommy, it's Daddy.

20
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,280
- 嘿，比利  - 嘿，吉莉
- Hey, Billy.
- Hey, Jillie.

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,100
你什么时候回家？
When are you coming home?

22
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,040
这就要看情况了，你现在穿着什么？
That depends really. What are you wearing?

23
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,620
睡衣
Lingerie.

24
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,620
和我平时从学校接艾玛回家时穿的一样
Same thing I always wear
when I pick up Emma from school.

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,560
难怪老师给艾玛打的分数越来越高
That explains the good grades she's been getting.

26
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,540
比利，怎么不说话了？
Hello? Billy?

27
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,380
听着，我得走了，晚点打电话给你
Um, listen, I gotta go. I'm gonna call
you back a little bit later.

28
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,820
好吧，亲爱的，我爱你
All right, baby. Love you.

29
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,840
嘿，站住！那是我的车！
Hey! That's my bike!

30
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,580
中情局办事处
美国驻伦敦大使馆

31
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,680
桂格韦尔斯
中情局驻伦敦办事处主管

32
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,360
我们在桥上失去了他的踪迹
So we lost him off the bridge,

33
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,180
但他在环岛路上只有三个去向
but he has three options at the roundabout.

34
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,900
滑铁卢路，斯坦福大街和滑铁卢桥
Waterloo Road, Stamford Street, and Waterloo Bridge.

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,080
他已经失联近20分钟了
He's been off the grid for 20 minutes.

36
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,620
给我环岛路四面的监控录像
I want two by twos out from the roundabout.

37
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,040
- 嘿查理，刷新一下显示屏  - 是
- Hey, Charlie, re-wreck every screen.
- Sir.

38
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,540
找到他了，他在银行地铁站
Found him. Bank two.

39
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,900
黑色皮包和钱都不见了
Duffle's gone. Money's gone.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,720
- 什么时间出现的？  - 就是现在
- Time stamp?
- It's now.

41
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,440
Hey.

42
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,660
- 要去哪？  - 尽管开就行
- Where to, mate?
- Just drive.

43
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,840
谢谢，不要开的太快
Please, thank you. Not too fast.

44
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,440
他上了辆黑色计程车
It's a black cab.

45
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,260
车牌号为SI52-JGN，我去追
License number S-I-5-2-J-G-N. I'm on him.

46
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,320
I52-JGN
I-5-2...J-G-N.

I-5-2...J-G-N.

48
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,360
博伊德，威廉
Boyd, William.

49
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,860
我能借用一下你的手机吗？多给你20镑
Can I borrow your mobile, mate? 20 quid extra.

50
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,180
- 你想要借我的手机？  - 对
- Borrow me phone?
- Yeah.

51
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,090
可以，给我25镑，只能打一个电话啊
20 quid? One call, yeah?

52
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,070
玛塔，我是比利
不能回去找荷兰人，他们盯上我了

53
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,860
是比利发来的
It's Billy.

54
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,380
他们盯上他了
They're all over him.

55
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,380
让比利引他们去那个以前用过的水泥厂
Get him to the cement factory
in Deptford. We used it before.

56
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,640
现在赶快派一个清理小队过去
Get a laundry team rolling, now.

57
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,300
我要去一家水泥厂，在霍林科路，德特福德码头附近
We're going to a cement factory.
Hornlink Way, Deptford docks.

58
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,220
我把地址输到了你的GPS里，你跟着走就行
I put it in your GPS, so just follow that.

59
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,760
好的
All right.

60
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,900
<i>前往目的地的路线已经规划成功</i>
Road to destination has been calculated.

61
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,160
德特福德码头
The docks at Deptford.

62
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,420
真天真，以为我会上钩？
Very romantic.

63
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,400
<i>在下一个路口左转</i>
Turn left at the next roundabout.

64
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,010
快快快！
Move, move, move.

65
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,480
<i>报告长官，外围情况正常</i>
Outside cement factory, sir.

66
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,420
- 这不是我要去的那个水泥厂  - 什么？
- This isn't a cement factory.
- Eh?

67
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,460
这不是我要去的那个水泥厂
This isn't a cement factory!

68
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,260
霍林科路，德特福德码头，小伙子，导航仪可不会骗人
Hornlink Way, Deptford. I mean,
the GPS don't lie, mate.

69
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,600
快掉头！
Turn around.

70
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,460
该死的！
Fuck!

71
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,660
- 发现了他的踪影吗？ <i>- 报告长官，什么都没发现</i>
- Do we have him?
- We got nothing, sir.

72
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,000
这里没人
Nobody here.

73
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,820
定位刚刚那台手机的位置
Do a GPS on that phone number.

74
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,490
给我马上找到他
Find him now.

75
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,860
要是你从来没去过屠宰场
If you've never been to a slaughterhouse,

76
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,700
你一定要去一次
you have to go.

77
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,600
去看看那些可怜的动物遭受的折磨
To see what we do to those poor animals.

78
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,620
我们用这种电击棍
They use this...A picana.

79
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,860
用这样一种恶毒的方式结束它们的生命
Nasty way to push them towards their doom.

80
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,170
现在告诉我，我要找的那个人在哪？
Now where is our friend?

81
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,720
比利，我敬佩你的毅力
Billy...I respect your silence.

82
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,880
衷心的敬佩
I really do.

83
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,720
可现在问题是，我要找到那个荷兰人
The problem is, I need the Dutchman.

84
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,780
最后一次机会
Last chance.

85
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,420
去死吧，疯子！
Fuck you, psycho!

86
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,760
所有人行动！
Left. Go, go, go, move.

87
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,880
Going silent.

88
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,260
<i>行动小组就绪，报告长官，我们刚刚到达现场</i>
Point established. Just arrived on site, sir.

89
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,060

<i>北部外围一切正常</i>
North perimeter is clear.

91

B队收到
Bravo, copy.

92
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,160
上上上
Go. Go. Go.

93
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,260
Go.

94
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,900
<i>- 请求支援  - 需要急救</i>
- Action required.

<i>离手</i>
Clear!

103

<i>报告长官，他已经死了</i>
He's dead, sir.

104
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,560
该死！
Fuck!

105
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,920
医生，我很抱歉，但这位说他是政府派来的，一定要见你
Doctor, I'm so sorry, but this man says
he's with the government.

106
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,380
法兰克斯博士，我奉命执行任务
Dr. Franks, I have one job at the moment,

107
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,500
要立刻带你去多佛搭乘A400空客飞机
which is to get you onto a A400 airbus
sitting on a tarmac at Dover ASAP.

108
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,940
你的记忆项目要派上用场了
Your memory program is going live.

109
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,850
我们一位特工牺牲了，我们需要知道一个只有他才知道的信息
We have an officer down
and we need what only he knew.

110
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,700
你的任务是帮助我们找回这个信息
You're going to retrieve it for us.

111
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,700
他还有脑活动吗？
Does he have any brain activity?

112
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,240
这是几小时前的检查结果
That was taken a few hours ago.

113
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,140
我已经有五年没做过人体试验了
I am five years away from human trials.

114
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,540
你有48小时找回这条情报
You have 48 hours to make this work.

115
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,840
事关国家安全，最高级别
National security threat, highest level.

116
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,500
你能否做到把死去哺乳动物的记忆
Can you or can you not transfer memories

117
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,500
转移到活体动物身上？
from a dead mammal to a live one?

118
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,380
- 可以  - 你需要什么？
Yeah. What do you need?

119
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,100
我需要我的仪器，工作人员
I'll need my equipment, I'll need my staff,

120
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,020
和一个合适的受体
I'll need a suitable, uh, recipient.

121
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,540
有人选吗？
D'you have any candidates?

122
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,200
有，但是你们肯定不会喜欢他的
Um, they're not gonna like him.

123
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,550
美国西弗吉尼亚州
黑泽尔顿联邦监狱

124
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,000
希望接收他的地方心里有底
Just so wherever you're taking him knows...

125
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,500
杰瑞可史都华，大半辈子都是监狱里的常客
Jerico Stewart. He's in and out
of prison more than half his life.

126
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,340
他不懂如何控制自己的情绪，做事毫无分寸
He's got no impulse control, no sense of proportion.

127
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,060
他无法估计出自己的行为
He's unable to calculate

128
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,740
会带来哪些负面的影响
the potential negative consequences of his actions.

129
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,740
他对任何人，任何东西都毫无怜悯之心
He has a total lack of empathy for anybody or anything.

130
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
打开二号门
Through.

131
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,540
他没有感情，不懂憎恨，也不懂爱
He feels nothing. No hatred, no love.

132
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,540
而且情况越来越糟
It gets worse.

133
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,850
这就是试图拉他入伙的帮派成员的下场
This is what was left of a gang member
who tried to recruit him.

134
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,520
说句实话，我也没有办法管教他
Truth is, I have no way to discipline him.

135
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,920
惩罚一个不知道自己错在哪的人是毫无作用的
You can't punish someone who doesn't
know they did anything wrong.

136
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,460
他不懂社会规则
He does not understand society

137
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,980
不知道哪些行为举止才是正常的
or how people are supposed to behave.

138
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,940
快点给我吃的
Come on.

139
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,960
- 嘿，杰瑞科  - 快点给我吃的
- Hey, Jerico.
- Come on.

140
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,160
这是人是来找你的
These men are here to see you.

141
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,650
他们要把你带走
They're taking you out.

142
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,340
我还没吃我的午饭呢
I haven't had my lunch.

143
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,660
好吧，给杰瑞科拿饭来
That's right. Get Jerico his lunch.

144
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,100
- 这就对了  - 把午饭给他
- Yeah.
- Send in the lunch.

145
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,090
好吧，给杰瑞科拿饭来
That's right, get Jerico his lunch.

146
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,780
<i>饭送进去了</i>
Lunch in the hole.

147
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Come on. Yeah.

148
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,600
Yeah.

149
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,880
行了，闹够了，午餐时间结束
All right, enough of this shit. Lunch is over.

150
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,260
你得跟我们走了，走吧
You're coming with us now. Let's go.

151
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,600
不行
I can't.

152
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,660
我脖子上有铁链
I got a chain around my neck.

153
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,600
你知道要用两发才有效
You know you're gonna have to use two of those.

154
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,160
Oh!

155
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,660
真好玩！
Yeah!

156
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,020
你们这群混蛋！
You fuckers.

157
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,010
你们这群混蛋！
Oh, you fuckers.

158
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,360
行了！
Got him.

159
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,700
打开牢房
That's it. Open the cell.

160
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,160
上
Go!

161
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,620
<i>G-EMHE特种直升机</i>
Chopper Gamma EMHG special,

<i>你们可以在22L跑道降落</i>
you are clear for approach on runway 2-2-Lima.

多佛空军基地
美国特拉华州

165
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
把这个交给医生
Give this to the doctor.

166
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,250
你有过敏史吗，杰瑞科
Any allergies, Jerico?

167
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,340
- 你说啥？  - 你对什么过敏吗？
- What?
- Anything you're allergic to?

168
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,660
- 我对运气过敏  - Ha!
- Yeah, luck.
- Ha!

169
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,500
好运还是霉运？
Good kind or the bad kind?

170
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,540
你说呢？
You tell me.

171
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,540
医生，一切准备就绪
We're all set, doctor.

172
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,780
以前动过手术吗？
Any previous surgeries?

173
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,400
以前？
Previous?

174
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,120
我没病不需要手术
I don't need no surgery...

175
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,860
给他注射150毫克安泰乐让他安静点
All right, hit him with 150 mg of hydroxyzine.

176
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,260
150毫克，明白
- That's enough of this.
- 150. Yes, sir.

177
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,120
你要对我做什么
What are you doing to me?

178
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,240
Ooh.

179
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,960
Ooh...

180
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,280
你头上有个伤口
You had an injury to your head.

181
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,700
在小的时候你受过伤，对吧？
You got hurt, right? When you were young.

182
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,400
你还记得你是怎么受伤的吗
You remember how it happened?

183
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,060
记得啊，我妈...亲
Yeah. My mother...

184
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,260
告诉我爸他不是我的亲生父亲
told my Daddy that he wasn't my daddy.

185
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,880
接着，他大骂我妈是个婊子，然后把我扔出了车外
So he called her a whore
and threw me out the car window.

186
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,320
杰瑞科，我们会照顾好你的
I'm gonna take care of you, Jerico.

187
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,620
<i>我们的下个嘉宾是哈维耶·海姆达尔</i>
My next guest is Xavier Heimdahl.

188
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,020
<i>他最为人熟知的身份是石心集团的创立者</i>
He's best known as the founder
of Stone Harp Industries,

189
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,180
<i>主要研制手机，电脑和通讯系统</i>
makers of phone, computer and communication systems.

190
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,540
最近他被西班牙政府冠上了叛国的罪名
Most recently, he was charged
with treason by the Spanish government.

191
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,780
海姆达尔先生，你是如何看待这些严重的指控呢？
Mr. Heimdahl, how would you respond
to these very serious allegations?

192
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:13,140
我认为，如果叛国罪指的是揭发最高层的大规模腐败行为
Well, if it's treasonous to call out
massive corruption at the highest levels

193
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,220
和曝光政治谋杀案的话
and to expose political murders...

194
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,100
那么我的确有罪
Yes, then I'm guilty.

195
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,300
可你的指控在法庭上从未被证实过
But your accusations were never actually
proven in a court of law.

196
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,000
当然没有，怎么可能在大庭广众之下被证实
Of course not. How could they be?

197
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,520
警察，法官和法院
The police, the judges and the courts

198
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,340
全都是世界上最强大的犯罪组织的一部分
are all part of the world's
most powerful criminal enterprise.

199
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,540
先生，直白的说，你是要求推翻现在的西班牙政府吗
So to clarify, you're calling for the
overthrow of the Spanish government.

200
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,100
不不不，我要求推翻世界上所有的政府组织
No, no, no. I'm calling for
the overthrow of all governments.

201
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
政治家，宗教狂热分子
Politicians, religious fanatics.

202
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,340
给民众洗脑的企业
Brainwashing by corporations,

203
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,490
腐朽的银行体系，一去不复返
the corruption of the banking system... Gone. Gone.

204
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,180
像华盛顿，柏林这样的大城市，都将变成墓地
Washington, Berlin, Beijing will be graveyards.

205
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,300
到那时人们才会意识到
And only then people will understand

206
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,460
还有更好的运作世界的方式
there is a better way to run this world.

207
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,900
所以你真正想要实现的是一场全球革命
And that's what you really want here,
worldwide revolution.

208
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,380
必须推翻所有政府
Governments must fall.

209
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,260
找到一个，艾尔莎·米勒，前德国特种部队成员
Got one. Elsa Mueller. Former German Special Forces.

210
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,620
海姆达尔的同伙之一
One of Heimdahl's.

211
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,120
你们该出发了，杰瑞可史都华到了
Guys, you gotta roll. Jerico Stewart is now landing.

212
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,830
英国萨福克莱肯希斯皇家空军基地

213
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,320
比利还有呼吸吗？
Is Billy still breathing?

214
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,020
正在做人工呼吸中
Artificially breathing.

215
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,500
机气维持他身体的基本运转，但他已经死了
The machine's keeping his body alive but he's gone.

216
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,460
- 看到了那些二极管吗？ - 嗯
- You see those diodes?
- Mm.

217
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,740
它们向他的额叶传送微弱的电荷
They deliver a micro charge to his frontal lobe.

218
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,740
虽然他的大脑在临床上已经死亡
Even though his brain is clinically dead,

219
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,140
电荷还能最后激活一次神经元
the charge fired the neurons one last time

220
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,220
让我们绘制出神经元的分布图
and lets us build a map of the neuronal pattern.

221
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,820
然后你们把分布图传送到另一个人的脑袋里？
And then you transfer it to the other guy's head?

222
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,820
不对，不是传送
No, it's not a transfer.

223
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,740
之所以选杰瑞科做受体，是因为他患有额叶综合症
Jerico Stewart was chosen because
he has frontal lobe syndrome,

224
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,500
他小时候脑部收过创伤
trauma to the brain when he was a child.

225
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,620
非常罕见，一千万人中才出现一例
Incredibly rare. One in 10 million.

226
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,380
他的额叶还保持着尚未开发的状态
His frontal lobe remains in an undeveloped state.

227
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,900
能作为脑部干细胞的温床
A hotbed of neural stem cells.

228
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,200
我们用西塔波刺激他们，复制一样的记忆分布模式
We stimulate them with theta waves,
duplicating the pattern.

229
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,660
你们以前成功过吗
And you've made this work?

230
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,260
实验鼠成功的走出了他们从没见过的迷宫
Subject rats can walk straight through
mazes they've never seen before.

231
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,690
只用过老鼠做实验？
Rats.

232
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,380
人体实验呢？
What about human trials?

233
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,760
你正看着第一例人体试验呢
You're looking at it.

234
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,290
那家伙怎么了？
What happened to the other... other guy?

235
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,020
<i>开始钻孔</i>

<i>开始刺激脑部干细胞</i>

测试西塔波
Testing theta.

241
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,370
天啊，受体的体温正在飙升
Whoa, temperature is spiking.

242
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,580
在102，104点上有出血
We've got a bleed. He's at 102... 104.

243
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,420
给他敷些冰袋，别让他死了
Put the cold packs on him before he strokes out.

244
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,020
出什么事了
What's going on?

245
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,340
他快不行了
We're losing him.

246
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,600
必须赶快止血，终止手术，要不然他会死的
We have to pull out the robotic arm
or he's going to die.

247
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,820
好吧，我们将机械注射器移除，他就快承受不住了
All right, we're going to pull
the robotics, it's too much for him.

248
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,780
嘿，你们什么都不准撤
Hey! You pull nothing!

249
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,540
你给我继续手术
You carry on!

250
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,370
你以为我会在乎他的死活吗？
You think I give a shit if he dies?

251
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,050
给我继续
Carry on!

252
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,800
体温稳定下来了
He's stabilizing.

253
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,680
我们怎么向比利的妻子解释这一切
What are we gonna tell his wife?

254
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,040
我们什么都不用解释
Nothing.

255
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,720
对于她来说，比利十天前就去世了
As far as she's concerned, Billy died two days ago.

256
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,340
杰瑞科有比利的记忆不代表他就是比利
It's not right.

257
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,120
他和比利有天壤之别
Not when you come from nothing, like Billy.

258
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,360
你那么粗鲁，和他也差不多了
Like you.

259
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,300
杰瑞科
Jerico?

260
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,740
杰瑞科
Jerico!

261
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
杰瑞科
Jerico.

262
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,400
杰瑞科
Jerico.

263
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,560
杰瑞科，冷静一点，没事的
Jerico, take it easy, everything's fine.

264
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,060
- 我的头  - 我刚刚给你打了一针
- My head.
- I just gave you an injection.

265
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,540
等等起效了，你就会好受一些
It will take effect in a minute
and you will feel better.

266
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,400
你对天发誓
You swear to God?

267
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,060
是的，你可以信任我
I do. You can trust me.

268
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,900
好了，所有人都出去
Okay, everybody out.

269
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,780
- 不，不行，按照规定我必须  - 不，不是你
- No, no, there's a protocol...
- No, not you.

270
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,000
你留下，其他人都出去，快点
You stay. Everybody else, come on.

271
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,820
嘿，嘿，看着我
Hey, hey. Look at me.

272
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,040
看着我，你知道我是谁吗？
Look at me. You know who I am?

273
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,940
我的头快要炸了，我要止痛药
My... my head's bad, I need some kind of pill.

274
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,980
别急，我会让他们给你的
Yeah, no, I want to give them to you.

275
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,540
但首先你得回忆起一些事
But first, I need you to remember.

276
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,060
- 回忆到什么？  - 你的名字是？
- Remember what?
- What's your name?

277
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,680
我的...
My...

278
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,180
- 我的名字？  - 没错
- My name...
- Yeah, your name.

279
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,160
你的名字是，比尔波普
Your name is Bill Pope.

280
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,860
你干嘛老跟我过意不去
Why are you messing with me, boss?

281
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,940
医生，我不舒服，给我注射点东西，我需要治疗，给我点药
I'm sick, doc, I need some kind of shot.
I need something just...

282
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,740
别看他，他帮不了你
Don't, don't look at him. He can't help you.

283
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,380
只有你才能帮你自己
Only you can help you.

284
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,460
听好了，你叫比尔波普
Your name is Bill Pope.

285
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,100
你是中情局的情报人员
You're an intelligence officer with the CIA.

286
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,460
情报人员？
Intelligence...

287
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,500
搞什么鬼，这是怎么回事
What the fuck... What the fuck?

288
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,060
- 听我说  - 你对我做了什么
- Pay attention.
- What did you do to me?

289
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,340
- 你对我做了什么？  - 听我说话！
- Pay... Pay attention, all right?
- What did you do to me?

290
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,300
杨·史特鲁普，荷兰籍天才程序员
Jan Strook. Dutch programmer. Genius.

291
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,340
他向海姆达尔出售了一些系统后门
Selling trap doors to Heimdahl.

292
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,010
我要喝水
I need some water.

293
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,540
这才像话
That's better. Now...

294
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,180
听着，几天前
A few days ago,

295
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,820
这个荷兰人在暗网里发现了一个漏洞
The Dutchman dug a wormhole in the deep web.

296
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,620
你能停下让我给他看看吗
Will you stop this and give me a moment with him?

297
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,740
他脑部刚刚动了一个大手术
The man has just had major brain surgery

298
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,420
他要是死了你什么都问不出来
and he's not going to tell you anything
if you kill him.

299
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,940
突然间这个荷兰人掌握了整个指挥控制系统
Suddenly the Dutchman's got his finger
on the whole Command and Control.

300
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,340
他随时能向任何地方发射导弹
He can fire missiles anytime, anywhere, mm?

301
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,660
但事情的发展超出了他的控制范围
But he's in way over his head.

302
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,460
所以这个荷兰人就找上你，比尔波普
So the Dutchman calls you, Bill Pope.

303
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,980
他需要庇护
And he needed protection,

304
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,760
跟你比尔波普做了一个交易
offered to make a deal with you, Bill Pope.

305
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,340
求求你，给我点止痛药
I need something, please.

306
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,820
一片阿斯匹灵就行，我求求你
Aspirin. I'm being good.

307
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,340
老天啊，给他一片阿斯匹灵
Christ, give him an aspirin.

308
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,920
阿斯匹灵对你不好，但是这个药能让你舒服点
Aspirin is not good for you, but this will help.

309
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,820
比利，上头命令我们干掉这个荷兰人
Billy, we had orders to put a bullet
in the Dutchman's head.

310
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,940
- 但你改变了计划  - 天啊
- All right? But you forced the play...
- Oh, God...

311
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,580
因为你觉得你可以信任他
because you thought you could trust him.

312
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,760
我们能用钱收买他，记起来了吗？
You thought you could pay him off. Remember?

313
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,900
比利，我们按照你的计划行事
Billy, we did it your way.

314
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,360
把他带到了安全屋里，记起来了吗？
You got him to the safe house. Remember?

315
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,940
记起点什么都行，比利！
Anything. Billy!

316
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,420
你把他藏到哪了？那个荷兰人现在在哪？
Where did you put him?
Where is the Dutchman right now?

317
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,420
我们现在就想知道这个！
That is all we need to know.

318
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,760
你本来要回去找他
You were headed back to him

319
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,100
你拿上了钱
and you picked up the money.

320
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,820
准备去跟他完成交易，记得吗？
You were going back to close the deal! Remember!

321
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,200
记得吗？
Remember!

322
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,450
我什么都记不起来，混蛋
I don't remember nothing, fucker.

323
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:22,080
你把我跟其他人搞混了
You got me confused with somebody else.

324
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,080
试试家人
Try family.

325
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,700
记得你女儿的名字吗？
Your daughter's name. Huh?

326
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,140
你肯定记得，她的名字是？
Come on, you remember. What's her name?

327
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,660
艾玛，你的妻子，吉莉
Emma. Your wife, Jillian.

328
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,260
你叫她吉儿，对吧？
Jill, huh?

329
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,180
快点，你这个废物
Come on, you dumb shit, remember!

330
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,200
想起点什么，什么都行
Something! Anything!

331
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,300
一点有用的情报都没有
We have nothing, absolutely fucking zero.

332
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,900
- 科学理论是完全正确的  - 噢，科学，他妈的
- The science is good.
- Oh, the science is shit!

333
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,260
科学有屁用，你研究这个多久了？
Look at the fucking science!
How long you been working on this?

334
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,380
18年
18 years.

335
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,680
我们要求退款
We want a refund.

336
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,660
- 把那废物带走  - 是的，长官
- Take out the trash.
- Yes, sir.

337
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,280
杨·史特鲁普
又名“荷兰人”

338
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:18,580
石心集团

339
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,680
伙计们，我们又重回起点了，从头开始查
Guys, we're back to square one.
We start from the beginning.

340
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,880
查理，把荷兰人的那段影片调出来
Hey, Charlie, pull up the Dutchman video.

341
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,600
- 是的，长官  - 真是他妈的一团糟
- Yes, sir.
- What a fucking mess.

342
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,520
<i>我叫杨·史特鲁普<\i>
My name is Jan Strook.

343
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,880
我的网名是“荷兰人”
My cybername is Dutchman.

344
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,940
我现在是“警戒之盾”的唯一管理员
I am now the sole administrator of Vigilant Shield,

345
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,900
我掌控着美国军方的应急指挥控制系统
the Emergency Command and Control system
for the United States military.

346
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,900
我可以授权发射你们武器库中的任何导弹
I can authorize and activate
any weapon system in your arsenal

347
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,080
还能取消任何已经生效的命令
and I can override any standing order.

348
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,500
我可以把这个漏洞卖给你们
I will sell Wormhole back to you for asylum,

349
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,180
我的条件是政治庇护，永久护照，人身安全保障
permanent passport, guaranteed protection

350
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,580
- 以及一千万美元  - 关掉影片
- and $10 million.
- Turn it off.

351
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,580
伙计们，我们考虑一下这个
All right, guys, let's, uh, think about this.

352
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,980
海姆达尔的安全屋在这个位子
There's Heimdahl, and the safe house, here.

353
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,730
皮包店在这
Luggage store is here.

354
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,260
所以荷兰人就在这两点之间，对吧？
So somewhere between these two
points is the Dutchman, right?

355
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,080
现在问题是，具体在哪？
Okay, where?

356
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,780
宾馆，青年旅社，那会很快被我们发现
Hotel, youth hostel, we'd know about.

357
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,780
收容所也查过了
Homeless shelter, we've already checked.

358
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,480
所以他究竟在哪
So where the hell is he?

359
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,740
我跟你说了多少次，你根本没认真听过
You're not listening to me.

360
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,740
- 你好  - 我找比尔波普
- Hello?
- Uh, Bill Pope, please.

361
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,960
你是谁？
Who's this?

362
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:30,180
我是他的一个老朋友，杨·史特鲁普
Uh, old friend. Jan Strook.

363
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,800
他在吗？
Is he there?

364
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,920
比利已经
Billy's...

365
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,360
我的丈夫已经去世了
My husband's dead.

366
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,960
喂？
Hello? Hello?

367
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,920
喂？
Hello?

368
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,840
能让我跟他说几句吗？
Can I have a minute, fellas?

369
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,480
张开嘴巴
Open your mouth.

370
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,740
这是血管扩张剂
It's a vessel dilator.

371
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,420
能改善血液循环
It will increase the blood circulation

372
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,760
减少你的脑部压力
and relieve the pressure inside your head.

373
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,420
谢了医生
Thanks, doc.

374
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
你们要放我走了吗？
They gonna release me now?

375
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,940
保重
You take care of yourself.

376
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,040
好
Okay.

377
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,560
Oh, fuck.

378
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,900
You all right?

379
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,180
上面那种给我来一个
One of those. I want that.

380
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,060
4块2
￡4.20.

381
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,540
11号，东西好了
Hey, number 11, order up.

382
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,140
- 嘿，嘿，嘿！这不是给你的  - 嗯
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey!
- Mm.

383
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,860
来打一架啊
Go on.

384
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,220
你真好笑
You're funny.

385
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,970
不值得动手动脚
It's not worth the kerfuffle, man.

386
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,520
这家伙是谁啊
Who is this guy?

387
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,980
你的脸怎么了
What's wrong with your face?

388
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,970
我的地盘我做主
- United, all right!
- Oi, yeah!

389
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,760
- 你的车归我了  - 你说什么？
- I'm taking your van.
- What?

390
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,180
你说什么？
What did you say?

391
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,800
我说你的车归我了
I said I'm taking your van.

392
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,540
嘿，这家伙在胡言乱语，他说我的车归他了
Hey, this nob says he's taking our van.

393
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,420
什么？这人脑子有洞吧
What? That's bang out of order!

394
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,000
你病的不轻阿，现在给我滚开
That's out of order, mate. Now fuck off.

395
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,420
快滚
Go on, jog on.

396
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,700
怎么回事？
What the fuck is going on here?

397
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,020
这他妈是怎么回事？
What the fuck is that?

398
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,440
怎么回事？
What the fuck?

399
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,880
- 我的腿，你这个混蛋  - 马丁！
- My leg! You fuck!
- Martin!

400
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,960
你他妈的
You fucking cunt!

401
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,940
这家伙是谁啊？
Who is this guy, huh?

402
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,820
我的头有点冷
My head's cold.

403
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,700
- 混音金曲  - 带你聆听
- The essential mix.
- Bloody new.

404
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,660
全世界最红的深浩室音乐

509
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,970
老天爷，赶快锁住系统，关闭账户

No, leave him in there.
I want to see what he's looking for.

医生，怎么回事？

524
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,780
上回的药再给我一些
I need more of those pills, all right?

525
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,660
没有那些药，我一想起比尔波普的事
Because without them,
when I remember Bill Pope stuff,

526
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,540
脑袋就像要爆炸一样
it's like my head's being crushed
from the fucking inside!

527

unless you figure out how to help me.

530
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,380
好，好的，没问题
Yeah, of course. Yes, yes, of course.

现在去哪？
Well, where to?

532
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,900
嗯...
Um...

533
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,360
现在去哪？我在等你回答我
Where to? I'm not hearing anything.

534
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,880

抱歉，我不该骂人
That was mean, I'm sorry.

540
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,820
你听见了吗？我才不抱歉
You hear that? I'm not sorry.

541
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:24,340
那是比利说的，不是我，他总是坏我的好事
That's Billy talking, not me.
This guy's fucking up my game.

542
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:28,100
比尔波普的人格正在影响着你的行为
Billy Pope's personality
is affecting your behavior. Goddamn.

543
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,020
我才不认识比利，我才不认识那死人
I don't know about Billy, all right?
I don't know about that shit.

544
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,340
我只知道我还活着
All I know is that I'm living this.

545
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,660
我还能做事，这都是你弄的，对吗？
I can do stuff. It was you, all right?

546
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,380
是你把那些东西塞到我脑子里的，我查过你了
You're the one that put stuff in my head.
I tracked you down.

547
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,860
你拥有了他的能力
You have skill sets?

548
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,300
没错，现在我会数学，我会说其他语言
That's right. I do math now. I talk languages.

549
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,020
我想去哪就去哪，想做什么就做什么
I go where I want, I do what I want.

550
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,340
我脱胎换骨，焕然一新
Everything's different. I'm brand-new.

551
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,300
你的记忆是时序性的吗？
Are these memories chronological?

552
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,580
我不知道，有时我看到什么，闻到什么
I don't know. It's kicked off by shit I see, smells.

553
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,060
记忆就会一下子涌现出来
You know, sometimes stuff just blurts out.

554
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,900
求求你，给我一片那种药就行
Please, I just need one of those pills.

555
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,330
- 好的  - 我只需要...
- Okay. Okay.
- All right. All I need is...

556
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,300
我只需要一片药
All I need is one pill.

557
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,520
杰瑞科，你刚刚提到的那些是比利的感官
You're recalling Billy Pope's
automatic responses to sensory stimulus.

558
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,080
对触觉，视觉，嗅觉刺激的反应
Cognitive sense, touch, smell.

559
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,010
- 对情绪刺激有反应吗？  - 有啊
- What about emotions?
- Yeah.

560
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,260
我见了他的妻子和女儿
I met his wife and kid.

561
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:13,020
- 然后呢  - 然后...
- And?
- And there was...

562
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,800
发生了一些变化
There was something.

563
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,140
"一些变化" 是指什么？
What do you mean, "something"?

564
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:21,100
别人总说我对任何东西都没有感情
People always told me that I didn't have
feelings about this or that.

565
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,860
我刚开始一直不懂那是什么意思
I didn't know what they were talking about until...

566
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,260
打不开，这玩意要怎么打开
I can't. How do you do this?

567
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,480
这是为了防止儿童误食
It's child-proof.

568
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,560
Yeah.

569
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,420
现在呢？
What about now?

570
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,420
现在你让我脑子更乱了
Now it's messing me up.

571
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,500
这都是为了让你舒服点，你说的这些叫做“感情”
Or making you better. It's called emotions.

572
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,860
Hmm.

573
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,940
管它是什么，反正对我没用
Well, whatever they are, I got no use for them.

574
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,920
没有感情的生活将失去很多意义
Not much meaning in life without them.

575
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,560
是嘛，多谢你的药，博士
Yeah, well. Thanks for the pills, doc.

576
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:01,980
在你的记忆消失前我得给你做些检查
I need to run some tests on you
before the re-patterning starts to fade.

577
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,560
记忆消退？
Starts to fade?

578
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,400
我还剩下多久时间？
How much, uh, time...do I got?

579
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,420
大概48小时吧，我不确定
48 hours. I don't know.

580
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,020
也许有办法再延长一会儿
Maybe there's a way to make it last longer.

581
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,240
那我现在得出发了，是吧博士？
Well, then I better boogie, right, doc?

582
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,160
我还有不少事要做，还有一大袋子钱等着我呢
Got shit to do. Money to find.

583
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,660
- 钱？  - 没错，好大一袋子钱
- Money?
- Yeah. Big bag full of money.

584
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:28,780
找到钱以后你准备用它们买什么？
What are you gonna do with money when you find it?

585
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,610
我没想好
I don't know.

586
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:37,340
买一栋房子，你知道的，买个电视
I might buy a house, you know. Get a TV.

587
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,460
像其他人一样去度个假，对吧？
Go on vacation like other people, right?

588
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,840
那挺不错的
Of course.

589
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,820
这是药钱，这次我请客
Here. Take what I owe you.

590
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,490
谢了
- On the house.
- Cheers.

591
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,680
谁他妈说谢了
Cheers. Who the fuck says "cheers"?

592
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,980
鲁伊斯拉
Ruiza.

593
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,420
上次阿森纳的那场球你还欠比利20镑吧
You still owe Billy ￡20 on Arsenal.

594
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,500
现在还给我也一样，没错吧
Guess it's only fair you pay me, right?

595
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,860
行了，别打了
All right, that's enough!

596
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,700
你什么都记得，对吧？
You remember everything, right?

597
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,780
荷兰人在哪？
Where's the Dutchman?

598
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,820
我不知道，但我知道迈克的脚踝就要断了
I don't know. But I remember Mike's busted-up ankle.

599
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,220
我不知道你的人平时怎么做事的
I don't know what your men do,

600
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,900
但是你们不能再打他了
I don't know how they do it,
but you have got to stop hitting him,

601
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,720
尤其是不能打头
especially in the head.

602
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:12,460
明白了，他马上就到我这了
I get the point. But he's coming over here.

603
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,220
我见到的这个是谁的人格
So who am I dealing with in there?

604
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,730
比尔波普的？
Is it Bill Pope?

605
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,540
不，还是杰瑞科，可是他受到比尔波普的影响
No, he's Jerico. But he's influenced
by Billy Pope's memories,

606
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,460
像是记忆、技能和习惯影响了
skill sets, routines.

607
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,900
- 习惯？  - 没错，习惯
- Routines?
- Yeah, routines.

608
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,730
生活中很多行为久而久之会变成潜意识的习惯
Most of what we do in life
is reduced to subconscious routine.

609
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:31,540
就是它们将比尔波普和杰瑞科联系在了一块
It's these things that have made
the leap from Bill Pope into Jerico.

610
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,050
他提到了一袋钱
He mentioned money, a bag of it.

611
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:36,340
钱激励着他，把那些钱给他，可能他就会告诉你你想知道的一切
It's driving him. Offer him that money,
he'll give you anything you want.

612
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,500
带他去你们最后一次见到荷兰人的地方
Take him to the last place you had the Dutchman,

613
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,260
刺激比尔波普的记忆，跟着线索走就行
trigger Billy Pope's memories, and follow the trail.

614
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,760
卢比扬卡广场那边刚刚发来的情报
Source in Lubyanka Square just forwarded this to us.

615
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,060
荷兰人正在试图与俄罗斯人做交易
The Dutchman is trying
to make a deal with the Russians.

616
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,560
他今天下午6点证明他对“警戒之盾”的掌控权
Says he's gonna give them proof today at 6:00 P.M.

617
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,300
你听到了没？我们完蛋了
Did you hear that? We're fucked.

618
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,820
就因为你要选那个神经病，而不要一个海豹六队的英雄
Because you wanted a psychopath
instead of a hero from Seal Team Six.

619
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,130
距离下午六点还有3小时

620
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:33,380
包里的钱是用来跟荷兰人交易的
The ransom money in the bag.

621
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,050
你带我们找到荷兰人，那些钱就归你了
You take us to the Dutchman, it's yours.

622
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,960
成交吗？
Do we have a deal?

623
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,920
成交吗？
Do we have a deal?

624
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:55,010
我还要那个！
That. That.

625
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,800
没错，海边
Yeah. The beach.

626
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,820
那个我也要，我要去那里
I want that too. I want to go there.

627
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,380
好
Okay.

628
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,900
好，我们会带你去海边
Okay, you can go to the beach.

629
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,440
现在成交吗？
Now, do we have a deal?

630
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,940
成交
Yeah.

631
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,860
- 别开枪！  - 放开他！
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Get your hands off him!

632
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,780
都给我退下
Stand down!

633
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,200
只有你能了解这件事
Only you can put out this fire.

634
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:36,380
告诉我们荷兰人在哪，那些钱就归你了
The Dutchman.
Where is he? And the money's yours.

635
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,460
那些钱归我？
The money's mine?

636
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,300
全给你
All of it.

637
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,970
我还要去海边
I want to go there.

638
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,920
那照片也归你
And the picture. Yeah.

639
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,090
杰瑞科，走哪边？
Which way, Jerico?

640
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,680
走右边
Right.

641
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:38,690
<i>伦敦城市机场</i>

642
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,660
长官，我们的面部识别系统发现了一位重要通缉犯
Sir, the facial recognition system
just picked up a red notice.

643
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,280
停车！停车！
Pull over! Pull over!

644
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,100
把罪犯送回局里
Put the convict on ice and send him home.

645
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,260
- 就这样？ - 荷兰人在伦敦城市机场被拦截了
- That's it?
- The Dutchman's been flagged at London City airport.

646
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,220
安全局的人盯着他呢
MI-5 are covering him.

647
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,180
我们得马上赶过去
We're heading over.

648
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,660
嘿！嘿！
Hey! Hey!

649
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,180
嘿！我的钱呢
Hey, my money.

650
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,850
嘿！我的钱怎么了？
Hey! What about my money?

651
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,900
艾尔莎，就看你的了
Elsa, he's yours now.

652
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,160
我要抓活的
I need him alive.

653
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,850
恐怕他不是你们要找的那位
I'm afraid it's not your man.

654
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:50,220
我中弹了
I'm hit!

655
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,730
把枪给我
Give me the gun!

656
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,360
别杀他
Don't shoot him!

657
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,720
先生，我们派潜水队去打捞杰瑞科的尸体
Sir, we ordered a dive team
to search for Jerico's body.

658
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,080
真是他妈的一团糟
What a fucking mess.

659
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,660
我们得阻止荷兰人跟俄罗斯人的交易
The Russians cannot be allowed to make the buy.

660
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,090
给我监视他们的大使馆
Blanket their embassy.

661
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,220
无论谁进出要检查，明白了吗？
Anything in, anything out gets covered.

662
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,620
是，长官
- Clear?
- Yes, sir.

663
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:36,160
海姆达尔这混蛋从一开始就跟在我们屁股后面
And that fucker Heimdahl's been
up our asses from the start.

664
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:40,170
给我换新的密码，新的防火墙
I want new passcodes, new firewalls.

665
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:43,640
- 切换成军用频道，明白了吗？  - 明白了
- Switch to military channels, got it?
- Yes, sir.

666
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:49,390
距下午六点还有1小时

667
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:53,820
<i>今天早些时候康诺特大桥上爆发枪战</i>
Gunfire broke out earlier today
on the Connaught Bridge,

668
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:58,740
<i>枪战导致五人手上，还有多人伤势严重</i>
with five confirmed fatalities
and numerous seriously injured.

669
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:02,760
<i>有关部门仍在泰晤士河中寻找失踪者遗体</i>
Authorities continue to search
for missing bodies in the river Thames.

670
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,740
我很抱歉我把人弄丢了，如果我能...
I'm really sorry that I lost him. Maybe if I...

671
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,200
如果，天天就是如果
If, if, if, if!

672
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,580
如果你当初盯紧点荷兰人
If you had kept closer tabs on the Dutchman,

673
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,920
现在我们说不定已经搞到漏洞了！
maybe we'd already have the Wormhole!

674
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:23,160
不得不说我现在真的很不高兴，艾尔莎
I must say I'm not that happy at the moment, Elsa.

675
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,520
- 你这是赶我走吗？  - 不
- Do you want me to leave?
- No.

676
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,780
我收回刚刚说的话，抱歉发那么大的火
I apologize.

677
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,480
没事
Good.

678
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:48,090
我们一定得找到杰瑞科
We need to find Jerico.

679
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,740
妈咪，我能看电视吗
Mommy, can I watch TV?

680
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,410
亲爱的，当然可以
Sure, baby. Of course.

681
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,060
你在我家地下室干什么？
What are you doing in my basement?

682
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:46,810
这是什么情况？
What is all this?

683
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,850
这是艾玛的梳子
That belongs to Emma.

684
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,020
你和比利共事过吗？
Did you work with Billy?

685
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:59,940
我不觉得像他那样的人
I don't think anyone like him

686
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:03,420
会跟我这样的人共事
ever would've worked with somebody like me.

687
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,680
他们把比利的记忆塞到了我脑子里
They stuck Billy in my head.

688
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,730
看，我头上有个伤口
I got a scar. See?

689
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:14,360
他知道的一切，他会的那些技能
All the stuff that he knew,
all the stuff that he could do,

690
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,200
都在我的脑子里乱成一团
I got it all scrambled up inside me.

691
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,970
这是不可能的
That's impossible.

692
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:26,100
你们两个一起买的第一辆车，是一辆二手路虎
First car you two ever bought, used... used Rover.

693
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,700
车里一股炸鱼薯条味
It smelled like fish and chips.

694
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,700
没一个星期离合器就坏了
Bum clutch blew the first week.

695
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:35,100
花了你们100块才修好
Cost you 1,100 quid to get it fixed.

696
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:38,780
我告诉你，他们把比利的脑子装在了我身上
I told you. They stuck his brain in me.

697
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,780
- 够了  - 妈妈？
- That's enough.
- Mom?

698
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,060
妈妈，你在哪呢，我饿了
Mom, where are you? I'm hungry.

699
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,160
亲爱的，我马上来
Just a second, baby.

700
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:51,520
星期天晚上，做鸡肉和华夫饼
Sunday night. Chicken and waffles.

701
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:56,060
你烤的鸡肉，我做的华夫饼
You do the chicken, I do the waffles.

702
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:59,720
我知道艾玛喜欢只有饼底蘸糖浆的
I know that she likes the syrup on the bottom only.

703
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:07,060
那些记忆支离破碎，不断涌现
I get pieces. Things pop up.

704
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:12,220
在不同的地方，我眼前出现幻觉，看到以前发生的事
Different places, I... I see things.

705
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,360
别问我他们是怎么做到的，但是
Don't ask me how they did it, but they...

706
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,580
他们就是做到了
they did it.

707
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:20,080
为什么？
Why?

708
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,440
噢，天啊
Oh, God.

709
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:26,160
他们在找一个人，你丈夫被杀前把他藏了起来
They're looking for details about where
your husband stashed a guy before he was killed

710
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:35,160
现在去做饭吧，我把这打扫一下
Now, go feed your kid. I'll finish here and...

711
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,780
我弄完了就走
I'll finish here and get out.

712
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,540
不再打扰你
Leave you alone.

713
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,800
不
No.

714
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,650
比利不会伤害你，所以我也不会
Billy could never hurt you, Jill, so neither can I.

715
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:07,440
葡萄牙附近海域

716
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:15,930
美国海军弗吉尼亚级，SSN743核潜艇

717
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,740
长官，导弹准备发射
Hot bird in tube 4, sir.

718
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,380
这不可能，导航系统失灵
- That's not possible.
- Guidance system's a go!

719
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,720
- 定位系统失灵  - 关闭整个系统
- Tracking system's a go!
- Shut it down!

720
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:50,250
无法关闭，系统被锁定了，长官
I can't! We're locked out, sir!

721
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:00,240
导弹已发射，重复一遍，导弹已发射
Missile away! Repeat! Missile away!

722
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:09,260
在爆炸前快输入自毁代码
Punch in the self-destruct code
before the fish can arm itself!

723
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,170
A30 E40 BH
Alpha 30, echo 40, Bravo Hotel.

724
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,720
自毁代码无效，没有反应
Negative. It's not responding.

725
01:14:30,570 --> 01:14:31,320
导弹终止

726
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:31,460
导弹已自毁，未见核爆光
We're good. No nuke flash. We're good.
导弹终止

727
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:33,740
导弹已自毁，未见核爆光
We're good. No nuke flash. We're good.

728
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,700
老天爷啊
Jesus fucking Christ.

729
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,500
导弹不是我们终止的，长官
We didn't terminate that missile, sir.

730
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:01,770
你知道我的父亲去世了吗
Did you know I lost my Daddy?

731
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,820
我知道
Yeah.

732
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:09,200
艾丽是他送我的生日礼物
He gave me Elly. For my birthday.

733
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,540
不挖深一点，她的象鼻子就会露出来
If we don't go deeper, his trunk's gonna stick out.

734
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,720
那就挖深点吧
Go deeper.

735
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,540
这是你自己弄的吗
Did you hurt yourself?

736
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:34,300
住手
Stop.

737
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,700
艾玛，到妈妈身边来好吗
Emma, come here, please.

738
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,740
没事的妈咪，我们在埋艾丽
No, Mommy. We're burying my Elly.

739
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,520
快过来
Come here.

740
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:43,160
他说他是爸爸的一个朋友
He said he was a friend of Daddy's.

741
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,960
请你离开这里
Leave. Please.

742
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,490
能让他留下来吃晚饭了，他人挺好的
Can he stay for dinner? He's nice.

743
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,840
艾玛，到屋里去
Emma, go inside.

744
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,880
我把华夫饼做完就走
I'll do the waffles, then I'll go.

745
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,770
- 过来弹琴吧  - 你说什么？
- Come and play.
- What?

746
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:27,240
过来弹琴吧
Come and play.

747
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,820
我不知道怎么弹琴
I don't know how.

748
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,160
我来教你
I'll teach you.

749
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,340
我觉得这样好像不太好
I don't know if this is such a good idea.

750
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,680
没事的，来吧
It's fine. Come on.

751
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,810
来吧
- Mm-hmm.
- Come on.

752
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:56,140
像这样把手放在上面
So you just put your hands like this.

753
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:58,620
把手放在这儿
Put your hand there.

754
01:16:58,720 --> 01:16:59,960
然后开始弹
And then you go...

755
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,080
弹的挺好的
It's okay.

756
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:23,540
就是这样，然后接着弹
That's right. And then you go again.

757
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,900
好了，艾玛，很晚了
Okay, Emma. It's late.

758
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,420
该上床睡觉了
It's time to go to bed.

759
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:35,720
好的，妈咪，晚安杰瑞科
Yes, Mommy. Good night, Jerico.

760
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,600
- 晚安，妈咪  - 晚安，亲爱的
- Good night, Mommy.
- Good night, baby.

761
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,170
你究竟是谁？
Who are you?

762
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,160
我自己也不清楚
I don't know.

763
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,160
我大半辈子都只有一个编号
Most of my life, a number.

764
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,160
我的有时候神经不正常
My brain don't always work right.

765
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:13,980
有时做出一些异常的举动
I haven't always acted right.

766
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,360
有了你丈夫的记忆后
Having your man in my head made me...

767
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,960
我感觉到了很多东西，学到了很多东西
made me feel things. Know things.

768
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,640
知道了是非对错
Right. Wrong.

769
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,840
不过这都无关紧要了
I guess it don't matter.

770
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,080
医生说记忆很快就会消退
Doc says it's all going away pretty soon.

771
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,600
你能感受到比利的感情吗
Can you feel what Billy felt?

772
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,080
你能吗
Can you?

773
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:47,280
以前比利经常做一个滑稽的手势
There was this funny thing Billy used to do.

774
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,160
我受不了了
This is too much.

775
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:02,320
那个手势代表他爱着我
That was our signal that he loves me.

776
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:05,920
我
I, uh...

777
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:10,100
我知道的
I know... I know...

778
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:15,820
我知道“爱”这个词字面上的意思，但我...
I know what that "love" word's
supposed to mean, but I...

779
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:16,570
从来没有...
I never...

780
01:19:16,570 --> 01:19:17,340
- 我从来没有  -
从来没有...
I never...

781
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:17,440
- 我从来没有  -

782
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:18,930
我们结婚的那天
Our wedding day.
- 我从来没有  -

783
01:19:18,930 --> 01:19:19,140
- 我从来没有  -

784
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,330
你还记得吗
Do you remember?

785
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,250
记得
Yes.

786
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:27,300
在海边
The beach.

787
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,540
- 我第一次把艾玛交到你手上  - 是啊
- First time I handed you Emma?
- Yeah...

788
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,020
你当时是那么的开心
You were so happy.

789
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,840
是的，我记得，我记得
Yeah. I have...

790
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,460
我感觉到了
I feel it.

791
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,840
我感觉到了，我...
I feel it. Yeah, I...

792
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:52,160
他深爱着你
He loves you... so much.

793
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:02,080
你现在要去哪
Where will you go now?

794
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:09,080
我也不知道，去他...去他的记忆带我去的地方
I don't know, wherever he... wherever he takes me.

795
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:13,290
那就留下来吧
Then stay here.

796
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,920
你可以睡在沙发上
You can stay on the couch.

797
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,690
应该不是第一次睡在那张沙发上了
It won't be the first time on that couch.

798
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,060
<i>今日要闻：一枚神秘的导弹</i>
Our top story, a mystery missile

799
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:36,380
<i>在葡萄牙近海被发射</i>
that was launched off the coast of Portugal.

800
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,140
<i>问题是，这枚导弹是从哪发射的</i>
The question is, where'd this missile come from?

801
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:41,460
我们的对手都越来越不可测
Our adversaries are getting more sophisticated.

802
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:49,940
早安，我给你煮了一些咖啡
Good morning. Got you some fresh coffee.

803
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,530
谢谢
Thanks.

804
01:20:57,160 --> 01:21:00,130
不用太在意，没事的
Don't worry about it. It's okay.

805
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,260
在五角大楼给出导弹的来源前
...where this missile came from,

806
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,500
我们无法确定这次事件的主要负责人
we won't know who will be held accountable.

807
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,440
目前掌握的证据是雷达分析结果
This is now the smoking gun.
We have radar analysis...

808

814
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:22,980
一个带钥匙的书柜

长官，有新情况

阿克玛多夫，俄国家安全局特工

843
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:07,240
他怎么跑到达格南的一艘渔船上去了
What's he doing arriving
on a fishing boat in Dagenham?

844
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:09,020
他们还没蠢到
The Russians aren't stupid enough

845
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,620
直接在自家的大使馆里采取行动

我不是特别喜欢小孩
I don't particularly like children.

851
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:47,580
他们总是达不到你的要求
They never live up to their hype.

852
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,780
杰瑞科！杰瑞科，救命！求求你！

我们跟踪他们，不要交火

866
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,420
在看到荷兰人之前不要靠近

867
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:00,170
所有单位注意，不要靠近

873
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:45,300

I'm sending you directions.

947
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:06,540
- 你给我过来...  - 不，不，不
- You come here...
- No, no, no.

948
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:08,980
...把随身碟交给我
...and deliver me that flash drive.

949
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:11,620
要么我就杀了她们，说几句话
Or they die. Say something.

950
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:13,060
杰瑞科，救命，他抓住我了
Jerico, help, he's taking me.

951
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:14,620
- 他要做坏事  - 嘿
- He's gonna do something.
- Hey.

952
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:15,940
小孩先上路
His little one first...

953
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:17,540
在妈妈的目送下
so her Mommy can watch.

954
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:19,180
听懂了吗？
Do you understand?

955
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:21,220
我非把你宰了不可
I'm gonna fuck you up.

956
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:22,650
我非把你宰了不可
I'm gonna fuck you up!

957
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:40,530
杰瑞科！
Jerico! Jerico!

958
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,620
别把随身碟给他
Do not give him the flash drive.

959
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:44,940
听懂了吗？世界会毁在他手里的
Do you understand me? He will scorch the earth.

960
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:47,780
听见了吗？
You copy?

961
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:49,290
我已经搞清楚了
I got this figured out.

962
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,500
杰瑞科，你什么都没弄清楚
Jerico, you have nothing figured.

963
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,580
你只有一个半吊子脑袋
You only have half a fucking brain.

964
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:55,170
你不是比尔波普
You are not Bill Pope.

965
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:57,860
混蛋，他用枪指着她们的头
He has a gun to her head, asshole, all right?

966
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:01,850
他会杀了她们的
He has a gun to the... to the baby.

967
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:04,180
那个孩子叫什么，我想不起她的名字
What's her name? I can't remember her name.

968
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:06,850
艾玛！她叫艾玛
Emma! Her name is Emma!

969
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,180
接通车上的无线电
Patch in the ambulance radio.

970
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:10,460
接通了，他听得见
We're on. He can hear you.

971
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:11,980
杰瑞科，我是法兰克斯博士
Jerico, it's Dr. Franks.

972
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:14,300
我想我已经找到了保留你记忆的方式了
I think I can freeze
what's left of the implant, Jerico.

973
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:15,640
你可以过上正常的日子
You can be normal.

974
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:18,460
但得赶在记忆消失前我们得立即手术
But we have to do this now, before it's gone.

975
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:21,000
马上掉头回来见我
You turn around, come back here and see me.

976
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:24,300
那吉儿怎么办
What about Jillian?

977
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:26,260
这事关无数人的性命，杰瑞科，你把随身碟给他
There's too many lives at stake, Jerico.

978
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:28,060
我们都得死
We're all gonna die.

979
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:29,880
别管她们了，她们不重要
Leave them. They don't matter.

980
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:32,420
她们对我很重要！
They do to me.

981
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:23,440
一群废物
Little closer.

982
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:43,120
Yeah!

983
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:50,540
<i>有警员受伤！</i>
Officers down! Officers down!

984
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:53,780
<i>医疗小组出动，这里有人受伤</i>
Medical units en route. We have casualties.

985
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:09,560
他马上到，做好准备
He's getting close, so let's get ready.

986
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:44,360
杰瑞科
Jerico!

987
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,720
不
No!

988
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,240
艾玛在他手上
He's got Emma.

989
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:17,780
把枪放下
Put it down.

990
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:21,930
扔在地上
Put it down!

991
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,000
把随身碟给我
Give me the flash drive.

992
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:54,200
艾玛，快跑
Emma, run!

993
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:29,820
刚才那里的坐标是多少
What are the coordinates down there?

994
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:34,600
我有要送个小小的纪念品给他们
I have a... little souvenir for them.

995
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:43,780
密码确认

996
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:45,780
发射程序启动

997
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:04,980
<i>- 桂格尔  - 收到</i>
- Quaker!
- Copy!

998
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:08,820
海姆达尔刚刚发射了一枚巡航导弹，位于你以北60千米处
Heimdahl just fired one of our cruise
missiles 60 miles north of you.

999
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:12,080
疏散那个区域，赶快撤出去
Evacuate the area. Get out of there!

1000
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:17,700
嘿，你知道你刚刚做了什么蠢事吗
Hey! Do you have any idea what you've done? Yeah?

1001
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:20,660
你他妈的混蛋，你把我们都害死了
You killed us all, you fucking asshole!

1002
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:23,060
你在干什么，他中枪了，天啊
Hey! What are you doing?
He just got shot, for God's sake!

1003
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:24,700
退后，快把她带走
Get back! Get her out of here!

1004
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,420
快把她带走
Get her out of here!

1005
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,940
别操心了
Ah, you worry too much.

1006
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:32,540
我...我已经把那个家伙搞定了
I made... I made that guy fix it.

1007
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:34,780
- 谁？  - 我不记得他的名字了
- Who?
- I can't remember his name.

1008
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,260
- 杨·史特鲁普？  - 没错
- Jan Strook?
- No.

1009
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:37,740
荷兰人？是荷兰人吗？
The Dutchman? The Dutchman?

1010
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,380
是的
Yeah. Yeah.

1011
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:41,060
没错，那个荷兰人已经搞定了
Yeah, the Dutchman. He fixed it.

1012
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:42,940
- 搞定了什么？  - 他...
- Fixed what?
- He...

1013
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:47,320
杰瑞科！杰瑞科 你说话啊！荷兰人搞定了什么？
Jerico! Jerico, what did the Dutchman fix?

1014
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,260
海姆达尔发射的第一枚导弹
Heimdahl's first shot.

1015
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:58,770
不论他用什么武器，不论他想攻击哪里
Whatever it was, wherever he tried to send it...

1016
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,360
都会转而攻击他
it comes back for him.

1017
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:06,480
我跟那个混蛋说了
I told that motherfucker...

1018
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:10,680
如果你伤害了我，我会加倍奉还
You hurt me, I hurt you worse.

1019
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,360
见鬼
Fuck me.

1020
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:38,600
我的头好冷
My head's cold.

1021
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:46,640
我好冷
I'm cold.

1022
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:34,700
你确定那能行吗
Are you sure about this?

1023
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:37,080
他一直没有反应
He hasn't been responding.

1024
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:40,040
也许这能刺激他的记忆
Maybe this will trigger something.

1025
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:42,260
他只要想起一件事情，就能想起全部
If he remembers anything, he remembers it all

1026
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:43,850
比尔波普的记忆就能保存下来
and Bill Pope is here to stay.

1027
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,420
你可能不记得我了
You might not remember me,

1028
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:29,040
但我认识你
but I know you.

1029
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:22,760
真是难以置信，他记起来了
It's unbelievable. He remembers.

1030
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:27,280
你准备放了他吗？
You gonna release him now, turn him loose?

1031
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:31,280
我打算给他一份工作
I'm gonna offer him a job.

1032
01:44:51,060 --> 01:45:00,060
