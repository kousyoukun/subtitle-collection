大巧局
Family Plot

5
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,810
有人在這裡
Someone is here.

6
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,510
不太靠近
Not closely.

7
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,480
不太情願
Not willingly.

8
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,220
我感到了阻礙
I feel a holding back.

9
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,690
有什麼麻煩  亨利  
What's the trouble, Henry?

10
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,760
太多回憶  太多痛苦
Too many memories, too much pain.

11
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,250
太多悲傷
Too... much... sorrow.

12
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,870
無論和你在一起的是誰
Whoever is there with you,

13
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,640
讓他們說話  亨利
tell them to speak up, Henry.

14
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,810
讓他們靠近一點
Tell them to come closer.

15
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,650
我想我知道那是誰  布蘭琪夫人
I think I know who it is, Madame Blanche.

16
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,680
我想我知道是什麼困擾著她
I think I know what's bothering her.

17
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,520
"她"是嗎  別擔心  蘭伯特女士
Her, is it? Never you mind, Miss Rainbird.

18
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,320
沒有你的指示  亨利不會做任何事的
I won't have you doing Henry's work for him.

19
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,270
現在  讓我們一起來吧  親愛的  
Now, let's have it, my love.

20
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,960
這就是為什麼今晚我們在這裡
That's why we're here tonight.

21
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,900
為了幫助我的朋友  擺脫她的痛苦
To help my friend be rid of her torment.

22
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,690
她有休息的權力  讓她疲憊的頭腦
She has a right to rest her weary head

23
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,820
能在枕頭上歇息  於每個晚上  
on a pillow each night...

24
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,840
平靜地安睡  有如天使
and sleep the peaceful sleep of the angels.

25
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,080
你怎麼知道我有睡眠的困擾  
How did you know about my troubled sleep?

26
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,890
誰告訴你的  
Who told you?

27
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,100
她夜晚無法長睡
Her nights cannot go on like this much longer.

28
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,850
我從來沒有告訴別人我的噩夢
I never told a soul about my nightmares.

29
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,220
-你怎麼會  -是誰來到這裡  
- How could you...  - Who is this person who arrives...

30
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,160
今晚我們的存在  所以才不敢靠近嗎  
in our presence tonight, but does not dare to come close to us?

31
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,070
是她  是我的妹妹哈麗葉
It's her. It's my sister Harriet.

32
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:22,500
-絕對是  -她保持距離
- It must be.  - She stays her distance,

33
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,240
朱莉亞·蘭伯特  因為她沒有感受到  
Julia Rainbird, for she does not feel...

34
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,480
你的愛或是你的善意
your love or your kindness yet.

35
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,780
你太自私了
There is selfishness where you are.

36
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,750
我已經什麼都為她做了
I've had all I can take from her.

37
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,150
她每晚都來到我的夢中
Night after night, coming into my dreams.

38
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,420
發牢騷  抱怨  努力使我感到內疚
Whining, complaining, trying to make me feel guilty,

39
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,630
就好像我需要她來告訴我是非
as though I need her to tell me right from wrong.

40
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,700
告訴她  我知道該怎麼做
Tell her I know what has to be done.

41
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,230
我一直想這麼做已經一年了
I've been wanting to do it for a year.

42
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:58,100
但是我  朱莉亞·蘭伯特  已經做出決定了
But it is I, Julia Rainbird, who has made the decision.

43
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,110
我不需要她來鞭策我
I don't need her to goad me on!

44
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:07,180
他們在我夢中醜陋的話語  使我生病
They're making me ill with their ugly words in my ugly dreams.

45
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,950
告訴她該停止了  回去  不要管我
Tell her to stop it, to go away and leave me alone.

46
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,990
喔  不  不  別讓她走
Oh, no. No, no. Don't let her go!

47
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,560
-別讓她離開  -哈麗葉  
- Don't let her go away.  - Harriet?

48
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,730
哈麗葉  留下來  哈麗葉
Harriet, stay with us, Harriet.

49
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,710
你姐姐要和你說話
Your sister wants to speak to you now,

50
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,910
從她的心靈深處
from the depths of her soul.

51
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,570
怎麼了  怎麼回事  
What's wrong? What is it?

52
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,680
她說"我已經等了好久"
She says, "I've waited so long...

53
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,810
"想聽到你說話  朱莉亞"
"to hear from you, Julia.

54
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,440
"沒有你在  我很不快樂"
I've been so unhappy without you."

55
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,990
是你  哈麗葉
It is you, Harriet.

56
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,220
喔  我很抱歉
Oh, I'm so sorry!

57
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,230
我不該讓你那麼做的
I-I should never have made you do it.

58
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,230
喔  都已經過去了
Oh, it's all past now.

59
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,670
但是我會盡我所能地去彌補
But I'll do what I can to make up for it.

60
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,000
如果他還活著  我會找到你的兒子
If he's still alive, I'll find your son.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,040
我會帶他到我身邊並且愛他
And I'll take him in my arms and love him...

62
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,040
有如我就是你  我可憐的哈利葉
as if I were you, my poor Harriet.

63
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,780
我會  我會待他如己出
And I'll... I'll make him one of us.

64
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,120
給予他一切  一切
And give him everything. Everything!

65
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,190
離太遠了
Far away.

66
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,490
離太遠  太遠了
So far, far away.

67
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,390
但  但我需要她的協助
Bu-But I need her. I need her help.

68
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,060
我一個人做不到
I can't do it alone.

69
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,100
你看  我需要她的記憶
You see, I need her memory.

70
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,740
那都已經40年了  我不知道孩子被帶到哪裡  
It's over 40 years ago, and I don't know where the child was taken...

71
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,740
或是送給了誰
or who it was given to.

72
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,310
我不知道他現在在哪裡  或他現在是誰
I don't know where he is now or who he is.

73
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,580
對於衡量朱莉亞·蘭伯特  真實的愛  
The true measure of Julia Rainbird's love...

74
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,580
在於她現在要如何去做
lies in what she does now,

75
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,180
藉由你的幫助  當然  還有我的
with your help, of course, and mine,

76
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,320
親愛的  離開吧  
and that of the dear, departed one...

77
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,820
是誰漂流遠離了我們
who has drifted so far from us.

78
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,830
我們瞭解了  蘭伯特女士  對吧  
We understand him. Don't we, Miss Rainbird?

79
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:05,070
噢  是的  我是  我願意去做任何事  任何的事
Oh, yes. Yes, I do. I'm willing to do anything. Anything at all.

80
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,100
最後  幸福將會到來
In the end, there will be happiness.

81
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,680
從逝去的眼淚當中  沙漠般的心靈會開出花朵
From the tears of the past, the desert of the heart will bloom.

82
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,110
再見  朱莉亞·蘭伯特  再見  布蘭琪
Good-bye, Julia Rainbird! Good-bye, Blanche.

83
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,650
再見
Good-bye.

84
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,330
布蘭琪夫人  你沒事吧  
Madame Blanche! Are you all right?

85
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,800
噢  這是  
Oh. It was...

86
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
這到底是怎麼回事  
What in the world's been going on here?

87
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,130
我覺得我好像做了什麼事
I feel as though I've been properly done over.

88
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,510
你不記得發生什麼了  
Don't you remember what happened? Mm-mm.

89
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,770
不記得細節了  布蘭琪女士  只有大略  
Not the details, Miss Rainbird, only the gist,

90
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,740
你應該知道我的意思
if you know what I mean.

91
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,210
我以為你會告訴我一些要點
Suppose you give me the gist of it.

92
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,580
喔  我不知道  
Oh well, I wonder...

93
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,920
我能麻煩你弄點什麼喝的  
Could I trouble you for a sip of something? Ju-Just...

94
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,920
噢  當然  你要喝什麼  
Oh, of course. What would you like?

95
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,190
噢  隨便給我一點混合的  
Oh, a double shot of anyth...

96
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,350
-來點雪莉酒或許比較好  -噢  是的  沒問題
- A spot of that sherry might be nice.  - Oh, yes. Of course.

97
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,000
謝謝
Thank you.

98
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,780
-現在  請告訴我還記得的招魂內容  -說個大概  
- Now, tell me what you remember of the seance.  - In a nutshell?

99
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,810
拜託了
Please.

100
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,120
嗯  
Well...

101
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,250
大約40年前  你安排  
About 40 years ago, you arranged to have...

102
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,860
把你妹妹的小嬰兒送給了別人
your sister Harriet's baby given away without a trace.

103
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,020
如今你總是做噩夢  你困惑的良心告訴你
And now your bad dreams and troubled conscience tell you...

104
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,730
必須去找到長大了的小孩  並帶他回家
to find the grown-up person, take him into the family...

105
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,730
給予他財富
and bestow your wealth on him.

106
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,400
-很好  -謝謝
- Excellent.  - Thank you.

107
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,070
但我為什麼  要強迫我妹妹把小孩送人  
And why did I force my sister to give the child away?

108
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:53,230
我想  那個小孩可能是  私生子  蘭伯特女士
I guess the kid was a... illegitimate, Miss Rainbird.

109
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,180
我不希望你以為我是個清教徒  布蘭琪夫人
I don't want you to think me a puritan, Madame Blanche.

110
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,980
但是  40年前  未婚母親
But 40 years ago, an unmarried mother...

111
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,580
並不像現在這麼普遍
was not the commonplace it is nowadays.

112
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,620
尤其是在我們這樣的家族
And in a family like ours,

113
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,560
不得不犧牲一切代價來掩蓋醜聞
a scandal had to be covered up at all costs.

114
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,860
我明白
I understand.

115
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,960
我必須保持傳統
And I'm still sufficiently old-fashioned,

116
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,960
並維護蘭伯特家的名聲
and sufficiently protective of the Rainbird name,

117
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,970
尋找失蹤的繼承人時  
to want to seek the missing heir...

118
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,140
必須以私人並秘密的方式進行
in a private and secret fashion,

119
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,170
而不是去找偵探社
rather than go to detective agencies...

120
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,310
或是登報尋人
and put notices in the newspapers.

121
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,470
這是個明智的決定  蘭伯特女士
A most wise decision, Miss Rainbird.

122
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,620
那麼  現在  我們找到了必須請你幫忙的理由
Well, now, suppose we get to the reason...for my sending for you.

123
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,290
我已經78歲了
I'm 78 years of age.

124
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,720
我希望能帶著一顆平靜的心  跨進棺材
I would like to go to my grave with a quiet conscience.

125
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,260
特別是當我知道唯一的繼承人  就在外面的某個地方
Particularly as I know that my only heir is out there somewhere,

126
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,300
是我的行為  剝奪了他蘭伯特的姓氏
deprived by my acts of his true Rainbird name.

127
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,130
你能用你的力量幫助我嗎  
Will you help me with your powers?

128
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,940
如果你是誠心的  我可以
If in your heart you believe that I can,

129
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,880
我有責任讓我們共同去嘗試  蘭伯特女士
then I owe it to both of us to try, Miss Rainbird.

130
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,950
不  我太老了  做不到了
No, I'm too old for trying.

131
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,010
我只來得及去看到結果
I've only time enough left for results!

132
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,960
幫我找到他  布蘭琪夫人
Find him for me, Madame Blanche.

133
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
用你的精神力量  還有你的亨利
Use your spirit-control, your "Henry."g

134
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,860
透過我的妹妹
Get through to my sister.

135
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,990
找到她的兒子  查出他是誰  無論他的身份
Find her son, whoever he is, wherever he is,

136
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,500
我會付給你一萬美元
and I'll pay you $10,000.

137
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,490
一萬  
Te...

138
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,170
如果你是真心的  蘭伯特女士
Only if you genuinely wish to, Miss Rainbird.

139
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:36,240
但是不要認為這些錢是付給了我
But let's not think of this as a payment to me.

140
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,680
因為我很有愛心
There are many causes dear to my heart,

141
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,150
世上所有的慈善機構都需要它
which need all the charity the world can spare.

142
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,450
你不知道它讓一個女人多麼振奮  我的財富
You've no idea how refreshing it is for a woman of my wealth...

143
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,320
找個人只需要用到這麼一點點錢
to find someone who has so little use for money.

144
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,420
謝謝
Thank you.

145
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,200
那麼  我想我們已經談妥了
Well, now, I regard our arrangement as completed.

146
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,170
我的睡覺時間到了
I... It's my bedtime.

147
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,840
我必須向你這位  令人愉快的客人告別了
I must take leave of your delightful company.

148
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,870
對我來說這是一個難忘的夜晚  蘭伯特女士
This has been a most memorable evening for me, Miss Rainbird.

149
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,840
你讓錢發揮了更大的價值
See to it that you make it a rewarding one.

150
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,510
你讓自己反覆的陷入險境
At the risk of repeating myself,

151
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,510
我希望你不要忘記  
I hope you will not forget...

152
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,020
沒有人  絕對沒有任何人  能知道我們的尋找行動
that nobody, absolutely no one, should know of our search.

153
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,290
蘭伯特家的名聲必須受到保護
The Rainbird name must be protected.

154
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,620
我保證守口如瓶
My jaw is locked.

155
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,250
一言為定  再見了  感謝你的光臨
On that note, I will say good-bye, and thank you for coming.

156
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,990
事情怎麼樣了  
So, how'd it go?

157
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,270
我不知道  扮演亨利  簡直是在謀殺我的喉嚨
I don't know. Having to do Henry is murder on my throat.

158
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:11,270
-謀殺  -是  是  我明白
- Murder.  - Yeah, yeah. I know.

159
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,610
-那事情怎麼樣了  -她上鉤了  就等著被拉上來
- So how did it go?  - She's hooked, waiting to be pulled in.

160
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,450
另一條價值25元的沙丁魚  
Another one of your $25 sardines?

161
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,580
不  這是條大魚  喬治  一條大鯨魚
No. This is a big one, George. A great big whale.

162
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,820
哦  快點  告訴我
Well, come on. Give.

163
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,920
把你的眼睛留在路上  別催我
Keep your eyes on the road. Don't rush me.

164
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,490
好的  布蘭琪
Okay, Blanchie.

165
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,930
洗耳恭聽
Start way up at the top.

166
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,430
嗯  就像收聽ABC廣播一樣簡單  
Well, it was as simple as A-B-C.

167
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,960
亨利來找我  來自天上
Henry came to me from the Upper Brightness,

168
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,500
低聲對我說"這位女士長期有睡眠的困擾"
whispered to me, "This womars been having sleep problems."

169
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,170
之後就順其自然  按照邏輯
From there on, things followed naturally, logically.

170
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,470
啊哈  我一次又幫了你大忙啊  親愛的  
Aha! So I came through for you again, didn't I, darlin?

171
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,740
不  你在說什麼  喬治  
No. What are you talking about, George?

172
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,940
你是什麼意思  我說了什麼  
What do you mean, what am I talking about?

173
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,850
你他媽的知道我在說什麼
You know damn well what I'm talking about.

174
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,620
所有的資訊  是我向當地的藥劑師挖來的  
All that information that I dug up by gabbir to the local druggist...

175
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,620
關於她被失眠搞得快發瘋  
about how she was drivir him crazy...

176
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,620
試圖沒有處方購買安眠藥
tryir to get sleeping pills without a prescription!

177
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,160
這本來對我非常非常有用
That could have been very, very useful to me.

178
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,160
為什麼你沒告訴我這些事  
Why didn't you tell me about that?

179
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,930
你什麼意思  我沒告訴你  你他媽的知道我告訴過你
What do you mean, why didn't I tell you? I told you. You know damn well I told you.

180
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,700
不  你總是以為你告訴過我事情  但其實你忘了
No, you always think you tell me things, and you forget to.

181
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,900
我必須跨越天堂與地獄  去和亨利溝通
I have to go through heaven and hell, the Great Beyond, with Henry.

182
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,240
亨利  聽好  是我
Henry, my ass. It was me.

183
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,510
總是我
It's always me.

184
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,810
如果沒有我的調查  你這通靈人不過是個干臘腸
Without my research, you're about as psychic as a dry salami.

185
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,350
齷齪  齷齪  齷齪
Nasty. Nasty, nasty.

186
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,220
我已經厭煩了當你的水晶球
I'm sick and tired of having you hang me by the crystal balls.

187
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,190
顧好你自己的水晶球吧  喬治
Leave your crystal balls out of this, George.

188
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,790
不  別談亨利了  把廢話留給你的客戶吧
No, let's leave Henry out of this and keep the bullshit for your customers.

189
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,860
你嫉妒他  是嗎  
You're jealous of him, aren't you?

190
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,900
喔  拜託  布蘭琪
Oh, please, Blanche.

191
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,370
我喜歡你的嫉妒  這是你這駕駛的臭味
I like your jealousy. It's your driving that stinks.

192
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,570
嘿  聽著  我偶爾也是個演員  不是計程車司機
Hey, look. I happen to be an actor, not a cab driver.

193
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,840
我當然能扮演司機  但我相信地獄不需要一位駕駛
I can play cab drivers, but I sure as hell don't have to drive like one.

194
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,180
哦  直到我賺到  朱莉亞·蘭伯特這一票以前
Well, until I can collect from Julia Rainbird,

195
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,880
恐怕你需要  繼續扮演好計程車司機
I'm afraid you're gonna have to go on playing a cab driver.

196
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,980
我們倆都不希望餓死
Neither of us seems to be very fond of starving to death.

197
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,650
哦  我們該如何幹這票  這條蘭伯特鯨魚能噴出多少錢  
Well, how are we supposed to collect? How much is this Rainbird whale gonna spout up?

198
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,820
你要繼續扮演好私家偵探
Also, you're gonna have to go on playing a private eye.

199
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,320
上帝  不  我已經演夠了私家偵探
Christ, no! I've had it playing private eyes.

200
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,860
上帝  是的  喬治
Christ, yes! Now, George.

201
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,100
停止褻瀆吧
Stop blaspheming.

202
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,620
你想要詛咒十張大鈔  
You wanna put the curse on ten big ones?

203
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,240
等一等  布蘭琪
Now, wait a minute, Blanche.

204
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,070
-你說十張大鈔  -嗯哼
- Did you say ten big ones?  - Mm-hmm.

205
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,070
-一萬  -嗯哼
- Ten thousand?  - Mm-hmm.

206
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,600
-美元  -美元  喬治
- Dollars?  - Dollars, George!

207
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,210
現在  布蘭琪  你想想  
Now, Blanche, you got any idea...

208
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,220
我們能如何花這一萬美元  
what you and I could do with ten grand?

209
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,350
嗯哼  我們甚至可以結婚
Mm-hmm. We could even get married.

210
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,290
為什麼你總是要掃興呢  
What are you always a wet blanket for?

211
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,890
哈  你太誇獎我了
Oh, you flatter me so.

212
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,890
那麼  怎麼做  我們該做什麼  
Well, what's the deal? What do we have to do?

213
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,260
我晚點會在床上告訴你的
I'll tell you about it in bed, afterwards.

214
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,870
噢  拜託  布蘭琪  給我一點暗示
Aw, come on, Blanche. Give me a hint.

215
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,700
只是一點  前戲
Just a little... Fore play.

216
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,700
好吧  找一個人  就這樣
All right. Find one man. That's all.

217
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,810
哦  我們做過更糟糕的事  他叫什麼名字  
Well, we've had to do worse than that. What's his name?

218
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:04,280
呃  沒有人知道
Hmm. Ah... nobody knows.

219
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,720
-那麼  他是誰  -好問題  沒有人知道
- Well, who is he?  - That's a problem. Nobody knows.

220
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,490
-他在哪裡  -沒有人知道
- Where is he?  - Nobody knows.

221
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,420
喔  別說笑了  
Well, for chrissake!

222
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,290
你的意思是  都沒有人知道  布蘭琪
You mean, nobody knows, Blanche?

223
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,720
沒有人知道他的名字  他在哪裡  或者他是誰  
Nobody knows his name, or where he is, or who he is?

224
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,860
嘿  喬治  別叫了
Well, George, stop yelling.

225
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,700
有個人可能會知道
There's a possibility of one person who might have known.

226
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,000
-哦  是誰  -朱莉亞·蘭伯特沒有對我提到他
- Well, who's that?  - Julia Rainbird didn't mention him to me.

227
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,600
幸運的是  她的朋友愛達·庫克森跟我說了
Fortunately, her friend Ida Cookson did.

228
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,440
-哦  那是誰  -蘭伯特的私人司機
- Well, who is it?  - The Rainbird family chauffeur.

229
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,780
哦  你總算說出了一條正道
Well, now you're talkir. Now we're on our way.

230
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,710
麻煩的是  呃  
Trouble is... Well,

231
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,820
他已經死了25年
he's been dead for 25 years.

232
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,120
喔  別再說笑了  布蘭琪  
Oh, for chrissake, Blanche...

233
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,650
喔  不不不  別緊張  喬治
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, don't start to fret, George,

234
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,020
否則今晚我們在水床上  將會失去樂趣
or our water bed will be no fun at all tonight.

235
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,260
做為一個演員  你應該知道  煩躁會毀了演出的
As an actor, you should know fretting will ruin a performance.

236
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,930
你該不會是在擔心  我今晚的表現吧
You're not gonna have to worry about my performance tonight.

237
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:57,160
事實上  今天晚上
As a matter of fact, uh, on this very evening,

238
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,330
你會想要起立鼓掌的
you're gonna see a standing ovation.

239
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,720
她在這裡  不  不是男的  是個女人
She's here. No, not a man. It's a woman.

240
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,240
好的  跟我來
Right. Follow me.

241
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,110
只要維克多·康斯坦丁  還在你手上  我們就不能動你
As long as you've got Victor Constantine, we can't touch you.

242
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,810
所以  你不如把那東西放下吧
So you might as well put that thing away.

243
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,030
你一直稱自己為"交易人"因此我們以為你是一個男人
You've been calling yourself"The Trader," so we thought you were a man.

244
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,210
我認為我們也應該得到一些保證  確認肉票仍然活著
I think we deserve some assurance that the victim is still alive.

245
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,090
按照你的指示  無線電已經從直升機上移除
All radios have been removed from the helicopter, as you instructed.

246
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,870
"康斯坦丁先生正在昏睡當中  
"Mr. Constantine will be unconscious but in perfect condition when picked up.

247
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,790
只要等安眠藥藥效退去就會醒來"
Just let him sleep the drug off."

248
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,010
好吧  警長  開燈
All right, Sergeant, turn on the lights.

249
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,530
-別逞英雄  -是的  先生
- Don't try and be a hero.  - Yes, sir.

250
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,210
好  我們已經盡了我們的部分
Well, we've done our part.

251
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,110
我們要去哪  
Where are we going?

252
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,110
別發生任何該死的錯誤
Not one goddamn mistake.

253
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,650
還要飛多遠  
How far are we going?

254
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,020
你運氣真好  他們還願意為肉票付出
It's lucky for you they've still got the victim.

255
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,190
更重要的是我把你扔下去  這件事沒發生在你身上
I'd like nothing better than to toss you right out of this thing on your head.

256
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,040
當然  這趟小旅行是你預訂的  不是嗎  
You sure have this little trip mapped out, don't you?

257
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,310
我打賭  那東西甚至沒裝子彈
I bet that thing isn't even loaded.

258
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,720
高爾夫球場  
Golf course, huh?

259
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,960
耀眼  非常完美
Brilliant. Absolutely perfect.

260
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:02,560
我的腳快斷了  這該死的六英吋高跟鞋
My feet are killing me. These damn six-inch heels.

261
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,130
我恰巧喜歡高挑的女人
I happen to like tall women.

262
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,940
每個人都喜歡高挑的女人
Everybody likes tall women.

263
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,870
事實上  每個人都在尋找  高挑的女人
In fact, everyone's going to be looking for a tall woman.

264
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,870
但總是不盡如人意
Aside from complaining a lot,

265
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,010
你最近都在做些什麼  
what have you been doing with yourself lately?

266
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,150
噢  沒什麼  抱贖金啦  諸如此類的事情
Oh, nothing much. Picking up a ransom, that sort of thing.

267
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,880
你有看到任何  我們不知道的人嗎  
Did you see anyone, uh, we know?

268
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,550
有兩個看來是警察  另外第三個絕對是FBI
Two men who look like police and a third who just had to be F.B.I.

269
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,220
最常和你打交道的人
You mix with the nicest people.

270
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,360
家常便飯
Beats housework.

271
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,260
-你有對他們說什麼  -一個聲音也沒發出
- Did you say anything to them?  - Not a syllable.

272
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,500
你看吧  親愛的
Now, you see, honey?

273
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,860
我說過你可以學著緘默  只要你去嘗試
I told you you could learn to keep your mouth shut, if you tried.

274
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,430
瞧瞧是誰在這裡  
Look who's here.

275
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,690
嗯  有沒有人看到一位身材高挑的  
Mm. Has anyone seen a tall,

276
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,950
金髮美女  剛才她還在這裡
blonde woman around here lately?

277
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,950
喔  走掉了  有誰會需要她  
Gone, poof! Who needs her?

278
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:02,050
我要  至少多留點時間給我吧
I do. At least one more time.

279
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,530
好了  親愛的
Let me put that there, darlin.

280
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,010
康斯坦丁先生給我們  留了一點葡萄酒
Mr. Constantine has left us some wine.

281
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,750
我不認為他喜歡進口的東西
I don't think he likes the imported stuff.

282
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,820
嗯  還有我的牛肉乾酪
Uh... It was probably my veal parmesan.

283
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,300
我想我煮得太爛了  
- I'm afraid I overcooked it.

284
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,320
他喜歡在餐廳吃東西  就這樣
- He likes eating in a room with a view, that's all.

285
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,490
你知道  有錢人很挑剔的
You know how fussy rich people are.

286
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,450
別忘了洗乾淨
Don't forget to empty that out.

287
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,460
你不覺得洗馬桶  有損寶石收藏家的尊嚴嗎  
Don't you think emptying a chemical toilet... is below the dignity of a jewel collector?

288
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,660
-真是罪惡的工作啊  亞瑟  -我明天再做
- The wages of sin, Arthur.  - I'll do it tomorrow.

289
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,470
不能拖到明天  
Never put off till tomorrow...

290
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:01,930
-或是你今晚也可以先略過  -婊子
- what you can empty out tonight.  - Bitch.

291
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,440
亞瑟  阿姆斯特丹是怎樣的地方  
Arthur, what's Amsterdam like?

292
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,450
喔  大量的運河
Oh, lots of canals.

293
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,620
很多乾癟的老頭  
Lots of wizened old men...

294
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:46,250
坐在大石頭上  以銳利的目光盯著年輕人
with sharp eyes, sitting around cutting big stones into little ones.

295
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,690
你會看到的
You'll see.

296
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,890
我不知道什麼是影響我  今晚我渾身感到不舒服
I don't know what's come over me tonight. I'm tingling all over.

297
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,870
我告訴過你危險的  不是嗎  
I told you about danger, didn't I?

298
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,370
首先  它使你生病
First it makes you sick.

299
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:06,740
當你平安度過  它又讓你非常  
Then, when you get through it, it makes you very,

300
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,570
非常熱愛
very loving.

301
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,150
-親愛的  這  -嗯  
- Darling, is it...  - Hmm?

302
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,710
這太過容易了  讓人害怕
It was all too easy. It's frightening.

303
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,990
出色的計劃
Brilliant planning.

304
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,750
他們沒有任何線索可以追蹤
They don't have a single lead to follow.

305
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,330
我們對他用的麻藥有效嗎  
What about the ketamine we stuck him with?

306
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:32,070
哦  如果沃格爾醫生六個月前  拔我的臼齒時有效
Well, if Doctor Vogel didn't miss it six months ago when I had my wisdom tooth out,

307
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,070
現在對他一樣有效吧
he's not gonna miss it now.

308
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,440
不要在這裡浪費時間了  我們上床吧
Don't finish up in there. Let's go to bed.

309
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,140
-累了嗎  -嗯  全身酸痛
- Tired?  - Mm-mm. Tingling all over.

310
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,910
為什麼我會讓你佔有這一切  
How'd I ever let you get me into all this?

311
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:48,080
我想我愛上了你  因為我需要一些穩定
I thought I fell in love with you because I needed some stability.

312
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,020
哦  我猜只是你的性格不好
Well, I guess you're just a bad judge of character.

313
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,550
-你把到手的鑽石放在哪  -大家都看得到的地方
- Where'd you put the diamond, dear?  - Where everyone can see it.

314
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,820
-你才沒有  -我有
- You didn't.  - I did.

315
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,460
-你要告訴我在哪裡嗎  -你得先折磨我
- Are you gonna tell me where?  - You'll have to torture me first.

316
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,700
喔  我正打算呢
Oh! I intend to.

317
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,130
就在幾分鐘後
In a few minutes.

318
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,110
我已經夠尊重FBI和督察局了
Now, with all due respect to the F.B.I. And the Bureau of Inspectors,

319
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,440
我沒有時間玩遊戲
I have no time to play games.

320
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,310
不要忘記  先生們  我已經強烈的想離開這個辦公桌
Now, lest we forget, gentlemen, I have been away from this desk forcibly.

321
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,310
我還有許多工作趕著做
I've got a lot of work to catch up on.

322
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:25,270
這該死的事情  我們還要談多少回  
Now, how many more times we gonna go through this goddamn thing?

323
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,660
直到我們找到線索為止  康斯坦丁先生
Until we come up with something, Mr. Constantine.

324
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,820
這種解決綁架的方法真是地獄
That's a hell of a way to solve a kidnapping.

325
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,920
康斯坦丁先生  你要知道  
Mr. Constantine, you're not the first victim, you know.

326
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,330
你不是第一個受害者  還有其他人
There have been others.

327
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:38,200
好了  好了  但是從我這裡  你們也得不到線索的
All right, all right. But from me, you'll learn absolutely nothing.

328
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,700
-你永遠不會知道  -我知道
- You never know.  - I know.

329
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,900
好吧  弗伊
All right. Floyd?

330
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,370
現在  從地下停車場說起
Now. The underground garage.

331
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:48,140
-停滿了車  -聲音呢  
- Full of cars.  - Sounds?

332
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,380
-有個人在我身後  -是男人還是女人  
- People, behind me.  - Was it a man, or was it a woman?

333
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,380
-我不知道  -男人還是女人  
- I don't know.  - Man or woman?

334
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,710
-男人  -然後呢  
- Man.  - Then what?

335
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,790
就在我正要轉身時  我的肩膀一陣刺痛
It was a prick in my shoulder. I started to turn.

336
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,350
接著  我在一個房間裡醒來
Eh...And I woke up in a room.

337
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:05,860
是的  你有聽到什麼嗎  屋內或屋外的聲音  
Yes, and what did you hear? Inside or outside?

338
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,160
房間是隔音的
The room was soundproofed.

339
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,930
我什麼都聽不到  除了揚聲器裡傳來空洞的聲音
I never heard anything except a disembodied voice of a loudspeaker.

340
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,840
-描述一下  -但我已經說過了
- Describe it.  - But I've already done that.

341
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,200
再說一次
Again!

342
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,910
是一個男人的聲音  沒有口音
It was the voice of a man, no accent.

343
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:25,350
-電子變聲過  無法辨識  -有幾個人在那裡  
- Doctored up electronically. Unrecognizable.  - How many of them were there?

344
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,850
兩個  一男一女
Two. A man and a woman.

345
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:33,150
-你為什麼這麼說  -因為只有微弱的光線照射下來
- Why do you say that?  - Because the faintest light filtered down from above.

346
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,760
不足以給我機會看看他們是誰
But not enough to give me a chance to see who they were.

347
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,990
-那麼是誰煮飯  -她煮的
- Yes, and who did the cooking?  - She did.

348
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,730
-為什麼  -因為男人不會費心思  
- Why?  - Because a man would not bother to put the parsley...

349
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,730
在魚排上放香芹  這就是原因
on the filet of sole, that's why.

350
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,170
-她多大年紀  -喔  拜託
- How old is she?  - Come on, now. Please.

351
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:50,140
-她多大年紀  -25
- How old is she?  - Twenty-five.

352
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,310
-為什麼  -為什麼  
- Why?  - Why?

353
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,810
如果像我這樣年齡的男人  要被一個女人綁架
Because if a man my age is gonna get kidnapped by a woman,

354
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,300
他希望她有25歲  這就是原因
he wants her to be 25, that's why.

355
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,480
-描述一下你如何被釋放  -釋放  
- Describe your return.  - The return.

356
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,650
那空洞的聲音叫我坐下來  並背對著門
The disembodied voice tells me to sit with my back to the door.

357
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,020
燈光熄滅  門打開  他們走了進來
The light goes out, the door opens, they both come in.

358
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,930
我感到左手臂一陣刺痛
I feel a prick in my left arm.

359
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:16,130
接下來我只知道  我在醫院的病床上醒來
The next thing I know, I wake up in that hospital bed...

360
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:19,630
你就坐在那裡  開始問東問西的
with you sitting there, thinking up questions!

361
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,240
謝謝  康斯坦丁先生  你做得很好
Thank you, Mr. Constantine. You're doing great.

362
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,610
-這就是你的感想  -好  讓我們重頭開始
- That's what you think.  - All right, let's start all over again.

363
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,570
噢  媽的
Aw, shit!

364
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,640
亨利  為什麼你面帶微笑  
Why, Henry, you have such a beaming smile on your face.

365
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,980
我微笑是因為我很高興  布蘭琪
I smile because I'm happy, Blanche.

366
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,680
能透過你  布蘭琪  傳達訊息給你朋友  愛達·庫克森
It comes through you, Blanche, from your friend, Ida Cookson.

367
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,450
我是她的嚮導  亨利
I'm her guide, Henry.

368
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:13,120
只有在不被否認的時候  才能稱為真正的友誼
Friendship can be claimed only when it cannot be denied.

369
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,120
告訴愛達·庫克森  我們在這裡都很感謝  
Tell Ida Cookson we're all thankful here...

370
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,630
她溫暖而寧靜的心靈
for the warm tranquility in her heart.

371
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,530
因為她信任你  使得這更加溫暖
It will grow even warmer as she trusts in you,

372
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:27,470
向你傾訴  沒有對你保留秘密  
and confides in you, and holds back no secrets from you...

373
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:32,240
無論是對她自己  或是她的親密朋友
be they her own, or those of her intimate friends.

374
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,970
你聽到了嗎  庫克森夫人
Did you hear that, Mrs. Cookson?

375
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,980
是的  布蘭琪夫人
Yes, Madame Blanche.

376
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,810
亨利  我需要你  幫我們尋找沃爾特
Henry, I want you to seek Walter for us now.

377
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,750
透過善意的尋找  直到  
Search through to the Double Strand of Kindness, until...

378
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,220
我的朋友愛達·庫克森  能加入這愛的交流
my friend Ida Cookson is joined in loving communication...

379
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,430
與她親愛的丈夫溝通
with her dear, departed husband.

380
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,730
我試試看  布蘭琪
I will try, Blanche.

381
00:28:55,730 --> 00:29:00,070
但是首先  必須讓迷霧消散  並揭起薄紗
But first, the mist must part a little, and the veil must rise...

382
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:04,240
讓光線指引我們道路
to let in the light that will show us the path.

383
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,610
我準備好了  亨利
Ah, I'm ready now, Henry.

384
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:11,180
準備  準備好了跟隨你  無論你要我去哪兒
Ready! Ready to follow you, wherever you want me to go.

385
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:14,280
哪裡  你要帶我到哪裡  亨利  
Where? Where are you taking me, Henry?

386
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,580
是的  是的  我看到了
Yes, yes, yes! I see.

387
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:20,190
我看到你在向我招手
I see your hand beckoning to me.

388
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:23,660
喔  多麼迷人的花園啊  亨利
Oh, what a lovely garden, Henry.

389
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,430
我  我  喔
My, my. Oh!

390
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,400
那是  那是一尊雕像嗎  
Is that... Is that a statue there?

391
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,630
噢  那是沃爾特站在噴泉旁邊嗎  
Oh! Could this be Walter standing beside the fountain?

392
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,910
-你怎麼能這樣對我  -我需要你的車鑰匙  
- How can you do this to me?  - I need your car keys.

393
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,910
-我趕時間  -喔
- I'm in a hurry.  - Oh!

394
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,110
你知道打斷我的思緒  會造成什麼損害嗎  
Do you realize what damage you can do my psyche, breaking in this way?

395
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,310
只要給我你的鑰匙  我趕時間
Just give me your keys. I need 'em.

396
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,310
是的  亨利  要幹嘛  
Yes, Henry! What for?

397
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,320
我找到蘭伯特司機的女兒了
I've located the daughter of the Rainbird chauffeur.

398
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,720
-我這計程車司機卻去不了  -喔
- And I'm not going as a cab driver.  - Oh!

399
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,290
-你說我應該做的  我卻沒有車  -我才不在乎你做什麼
- What am I supposed to do without my car?  - I don't care what you do.

400
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,690
-我開計程車  只要給我鑰匙  -樹在搖動
- Take a taxi. Just give me the keys.  - The trees are swaying!

401
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,160
枝葉分開了
And the branches part!

402
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,760
但那兒一個人也沒有  在這裡
But there's no one there! Here.

403
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,400
我看到影子消失了  空氣越來越冷
I see shadows falling! The air is getting cold!

404
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,300
光線變暗了  再見  亨利
The brightness... dims. Good-bye, Henry!

405
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,270
喔
Oh!

406
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,240
你找到沃爾特了  
Did you find Walter?

407
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,010
-在哪裡  -在廚房裡啊
- Where?  - In the kitchen.

408
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,910
沒錯
I did.

409
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,000
我不知道能不能和你談幾分鐘  海妮根女士  
I wonder if I could speak to you for a couple minutes, Mrs. Hannagan.

410
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,770
當然  我們認識嗎  
Why, sure. Do we know each other?

411
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,910
不  我叫法蘭克·麥克布萊  
No, I'm Frank McBride,

412
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,910
弗格森和麥克布萊律師事務所的
of the law firm of Ferguson, Ferguson & McBride,

413
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,630
我只是想知道  如果你不介意  
and I just wondered if you would mind...

414
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,680
回答一些關於你背景的問題
answering a couple questions about your background.

415
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,680
-我的背景  -嗯
- My background?  - Mm-hmm.

416
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,680
就像洗碗水一樣無趣
Dull as dishwater.

417
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,480
我的意思是  你為什麼會想知道這個  
I mean, what in the world would you be wanting with that?

418
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,950
呃  這樣說吧  嗯  
Well, let's just say that the, uh,

419
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:03,660
我對那些訊息感興趣  是因為值不少錢
information that I'm interested in could be won'th a great deal of money.

420
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,890
哦  是嗎  給誰  
Oh, yeah? To who?

421
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,090
嗯  我們只要花一點點時間  問幾個愉快的小問題  
Well, we'll get around to that pleasant little subject in a minute,

422
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:10,830
如果你不介意
if you don't mind.

423
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,870
-好吧  -太好了
- Okay.  - Oh, swell.

424
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,800
現在  我們從頭開始吧  
Now, why don't we just start at the beginning?

425
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,070
-你的父母呢  -喔  他們都過世了  蒙主寵召
- Your parents.  - Oh, they're both dead. God rest 'em.

426
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,710
-你的父親是一名司機  對吧  -你怎麼知道  
- Your father was a chauffeur, though, right?  - How did you know that?

427
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:26,480
他是蘭伯特家族的司機
He was a chauffeur for the Rainbird family.

428
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,420
又說對了  你像是個冥界的偵探  麥克布萊先生
Right again! You'd be a hell of a detective, Mr. McBride.

429
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,920
這我可就不知道了  親愛的
I don't know about that, my dear.

430
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,990
這段時間  你還記不記得有誰  
Now, during this period of time, though, can you remember anybody, uh,

431
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,390
是你父親的親密朋友  
being a close friend of your father's?

432
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:44,700
嗯  是有一個人  很久以前了  當時我還在讀書
Uh, there was a man. It was away back when I was in school.

433
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,170
那人經常和我父親一起喝啤酒
Uh, there was this guy that my father used to drink beer with...

434
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,600
並一起到村裡打撞球
and shoot pool with down in the village.

435
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,370
這哈利·休奎奇  和他太太莎蒂開了一間家禽店
This Harry Shoebridge had a poultry shop with his wife, Sadie.

436
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,380
休奎奇
Shoebridge.

437
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,380
是啊  他的生意一直很差
Yeah. His business was always lousy,

438
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,310
即使在景氣好的時候
even when times were good.

439
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,350
她曾經流產過  
And she used to have miscarriages...

440
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,850
就像其他女人一樣不再過生日
like other women have birthdays.

441
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:08,820
後來  他們放棄並搬走了
Well, they stopped trying, and they moved away...

442
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,430
搬到巴洛溪去  並收養了一個小孩  我想
to Barlow Creek, and, uh, adopted a kid, I think.

443
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,730
-男孩嗎  -是啊  一個嬰兒
- A boy?  - Yeah. An infant.

444
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,700
但是  你知道的  我不太確定
But, you know, I'm not so sure.

445
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,730
我  記憶有些模糊  嗯  
I... It's all kind of hazy, an-and, uh,

446
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,400
我試著回想  
I keep connecting it with...

447
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,310
嗯  我記得有一晚
Well, I remember this night...

448
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:33,180
我父親從休奎奇那裡  一個人開車回家
with my Dad driving over there... to the Shoebridge's all alone, and then getting in...

449
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,450
然後和我媽媽大吵了一架  因為他回到家時已經凌晨四點了
a big fight with Ma because he'd come home at 4:00 A.M.,

450
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,790
且他不告訴她  他到底去做了些什麼
and he wouldn't tell her what he was doing or something.

451
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:44,020
現在  我父親過世了  願上帝保佑他的靈魂安息
Now, after my dad passed away... God rest his soul...

452
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,830
我媽媽非常痛恨休奎奇
my ma was damn mad at the Shoebridge's,

453
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,360
因為他們一直沒有來參加葬禮
because they never showed up at the funeral.

454
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,330
-後來  她發現了原因  -為什麼  
- Then she found out why.  - Why?

455
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:57,300
就在一年前  他們參加了自己的葬禮
A year earlier, they'd gone to their own funeral.

456
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,970
-死了  -嗯
- Dead?  - Mm-hmm.

457
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:03,740
-他們和房子一起燒死了  -那麼  小孩怎麼了  
- Their house burned down with them in it.  - Well, what about the son?

458
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,380
海妮根女士  你沒看到有顧客嗎  
Mrs. Hannagan! Can't you see that there are customers?

459
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,120
-噢  好的  我馬上過去  -她馬上過去  夫人
- Oh, yes. Yes. I'll be right there.  - She'll be right there, ma'am.

460
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,890
嗯  聽著  麥克布萊先生
Uh-Uh, look, um, Mr. McBride,

461
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:16,250
-事情差不多就這樣了  -海妮根女士
- about all this being won'th something...  - Mrs. Hannagan!

462
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,330
-好的  -等一下
- Yeah.  - Wait a second.

463
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,960
我到哪裡才能找到  休奎奇的兒子  
This Shoebridge son... where do I look for him?

464
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,960
嗯  到巴洛溪公墓試試吧
Well, try the Barlow Creek Cemetery.

465
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,810
什麼意思  到公墓  
What do you mean, the cemetery?

466
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:29,440
嗯  我不確定  但我認為他死了
Well, I'm not sure, but I think he's dead, too.

467
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,870
抱歉
Sorry!

468
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,790
死胡同  布蘭琪
Dead end, Blanche.

469
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,230
早就埋葬了
Dead and buried.

470
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:04,120
-我是管理人  能為你做什麼嗎  -我是這家庭的朋友
- Caretaker. Do somethir for you?  - I'm a friend of the family.

471
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:11,160
什麼都沒留下  這差事糟透了
None left. Bad business, that.

472
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,600
你是指大火嗎  
You mean the fire?

473
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,770
我不喜歡他們同時被埋葬
Never liked them multiple funerals.

474
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,760
太多工作都擠在同一時間
Too much work involved, all at one time.

475
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:26,680
他們是一起死的  但他們沒有埋在一起
They died together, yet they're not... buried together in the same hole.

476
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,250
為什麼  
How come?

477
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:32,440
我怎麼知道
Search me.

478
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,220
瞧這裡
Here. Look.

479
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,640
1950年過世
Died in 1950. Died 1950.

480
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,640
1950年過世
Died 1950.

481
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,500
這兩個死亡日期相同
Both died the same date.

482
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:00,380
舊石碑
Old stone.

483
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,740
而這個是新的石碑
This is practically new stone.

484
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,010
-真是聰明人  -怎麼  被我發現什麼了  
- Smart fellow, ain't ya?  - Why? Have I stumbled on to something?

485
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:13,930
哦  很高興認識你
Well, nice meetir ya.

486
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:18,520
我該回去幹活了  明天在這兒還有份工作
Better get back to my work. I got a job comir in here tomorrow.

487
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,520
把那該死的東西關小  瑪西洛
Turn that damn thing down, Marcella.

488
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,090
我甚至聽不到自己的說話聲
Can't even hear myself think.

489
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:46,430
你想我怎麼可能  記得那麼久以前的事情  
How do you expect me to remember anything that far back?

490
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,660
我必須要翻閱我的舊檔案  來找資料才行
I'd have to go through my old files for that kind of information.

491
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,130
嗯  威勒先生  我不喜歡堅持  
Well, Mr. Wheeler, I hate to insist...

492
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:55,940
你知道嗎  麥克布萊先生
You know something, Mr. McBride?

493
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,100
你們律師全都一樣
You lawyers are all alike.

494
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,070
麻煩  麻煩  麻煩
Trouble, trouble, trouble.

495
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,210
來吧  我可沒有整天的時間
Well, come on. I don't have all day.

496
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:07,050
你說的那一家是哪一年死的  
What year did you say the family died?

497
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,480
嗯  1950年
Uh, 1950.

498
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,880
幾月  
What month?

499
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,540
這我可幫不了你
Ah, I can't help you there.

500
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,860
-我能坐下嗎  -好  請便
- Shoebridge. Shoebri...  - Can I sit down?  - Yeah, go ahead.

501
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,430

505
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:34,870
"第一教堂末世聖徒  巴洛溪"
First Church of Latter Day Saints, Barlow Creek."

506
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,780
那兒子呢  
What about the son?

507
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:42,010
-艾迪·休奎奇  他們的兒子  -艾迪  
- Edward Shoebridge. He's their son.  - Edward?

508
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,180
-是的  -好  不
- Yeah.  - Okay. Nope.

509
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,020
-沒有  -什麼意思  沒有  
- Nothing.  - What do you mean, nothing?

510
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,720
肯定有  或許他比較晚來
There's gotta be something. Maybe it came later.

511
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,190
等等  你是說艾迪·休奎奇  他的墓碑  
Wait a minute. You're talking about Eddie Shoebridge. His headstone?

512
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,690
是的  他比較晚來
Yeah, that did come later.

513
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:58,430
我想是  嗯  65號
I think in, uh, '65.

514
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,600
是的  我記得那孩子
Sure, I remember that kid.

515
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,500
他在這裡太受歡迎  有人說是他自己放的火
He wasrt too popular around here. Some say he set that fire himself...

516
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,670
為了擺脫他的家人然後消失
to get rid of his family, and then disappeared...

517
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,640
使他看起來  像是也在大火中喪生
to make it look like he died in the fire too.

518
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,620
他們從來沒發現他的屍體  
They never did find his body.

519
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,610
你是說沒有屍體在他的墳墓中
You mean, there's no body in that grave?

520
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:16,150
嗯  我記得  這就是為什麼當地的牧師  
Well, as I recollect, that's why the local parson...

521
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,320
沒有為艾迪做任何事的原因
wouldn't say any services for Eddie.

522
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,290
沒有死亡證明嗎  
Well, Wasrt there a death certificate?

523
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:25,490
我不知道  我也不需要知道
I wouldn't know about that. And I don't need to know.

524
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:28,120
我只是個生意人  麥克布萊先生
I'm just a businessman, Mr. McBride.

525
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:32,530
啊  在這兒
Ah, here it is.

526
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:35,900
"艾迪·休奎奇  特級花崗岩"
"Edward Shoebridge. Granite special.

527
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,240
"11月12日訂製"
"Ordered, November 12.

528
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,910

529
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,340
"395美元"
$395."

530
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,710
有趣的是  他以現金支付
Now, that's funny. It's paid in cash.

531
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,820
-他們通常不會這樣做  -那是誰  
- They don't usually do that.  - Who was it?

532
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,820
我不知道  麥克布萊先生
I don't know, Mr. McBride.

533
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,250
我猜他不想讓人知道他的名字
I guess he didn't want his name known.

534
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,990
什麼意思"他"
Well, what do you mean, he?

535
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:03,480
-你剛才說"他"-我有說嗎  
- You just said he.  - I did, didn't I?

536
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,070
哦  你知道的  我依稀記得好像  是個男人
Well, you know, I seem to sort of remember... that it was a man.

537
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,610
對了  年輕小伙子
Yeah. A young fella.

538
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:18,640
微禿  我猜他20多歲
Slightly bald. I'd say in his late twenties.

539
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,020
你有沒有再見到他  嗯  安置墓碑的時候  
And did you see him again when you, uh... Put in the headstone?

540
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:27,150
我們並沒有這樣做  是他自己來把墓碑帶走的
We didn't do that. He came by and picked it up himself.

541
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:30,860
對  我想起來了  用一輛拖車
Yes, I remember now. In one of those tow trucks.

542
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:34,390
-你知道  那種拖車庫的  -我知道
- You know, the kind that garages use?  - Gotcha.

543
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,000
不  這裡沒有  艾迪·休奎奇的死亡證明
No, there is no death certificate here for Edward Shoebridge,

544
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,600

only Harry J. Shoebridge and Sadie L. Shoebridge.

545
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,540
就只有這樣  
That's all you have?

546
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,850
哦  這裡還有
Well, there is this.

547
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,740
似乎曾有人為艾迪·休奎奇  申請死亡證明書
It appears to be an application for a death certificate...

548
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:02,120
日期是1965年11月4日

"沒有提供醫療死亡證明書"

"and nothing from the coroner's office, the application was denied.

00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:15,900
"申請人接獲通知後可到法院訴訟"
"Applicant, when informed he could file a petition for court action,

554
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,470

Funny, uh, you didn't hardly need any gas.

569
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:51,960
不需要加油  我猜你來這裡不是為了車  先生  
Didrt need no oil... Guess you didn't come here for the car, huh, mister?

570
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,960
你能幫我擦一下擋風玻璃嗎  
Could you get my windshield, please?

571
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,590
沒問題
Don't worry.

00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,770
你知道一個叫做  艾迪·休奎奇的人嗎  
You wouldn't happen to know a guy by the name of Edward Shoebridge, would ya?

573
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:06,240
以前住在這一邊
Used to live around here.

574

What would you be wantir with this, uh, what's his name, uh, Shoebridge?

我第一次和不需要  我付錢的律師交談
First time I ever talked to a lawyer didn't cost me money.

right now, for any information that could lead me to Eddie Shoebridge.

583
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,680
我到任何地方  律師通常是帶來壞消息
Where I come from, lawyers are usually bad news.

584
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,350
喔  不  這次不是  這次會是個好消息
Oh, no. Not this time. This time they're good news.

585
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,720
事實上  我認為艾迪·休奎奇  
Matter of fact, I think that Eddie Shoebridge...

586
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,650
會很高興聽到我帶給他的消息
would be delighted when he hears from me.

587
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:53,850
你要告訴他什麼  
What are you gonna tell him?

588
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:57,360
嗯  我的客戶要求我保密
Well, my client has asked me to keep that confidential.

589
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,220
誰聘請你去找這傢伙

-這也得保密  -我當然希望能幫你  先生  
- That's confidential also.  - Sure like to help you, Mister...

591
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,200
這裡的生意並不太好
Business ain't all that good around here.

592
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,570
-我想你能幫我  -是嗎  
- I think you can help me.  - Is that right?

593

嗯  這裡的人們告訴我  艾迪·休奎奇已經死了
Mm-hmm. See, people around here have been telling me that Eddie Shoebridge is dead.

594
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:17,980
如果他死了  看來他就聽不到  
Well, if he's dead, looks like he ain't gonna be hearir...

595
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:20,350
你要告訴他的好消息了  嗯
all that good news you have to tell him, huh?

596
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:25,550
我認為他還活著
I think he's alive.

597
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,650
看來這輛車不需要太乾淨了
Sure don't keep this car very clean.

598
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:31,410
你能告訴我  為什麼要在空墳上  安置墓碑嗎  馬洛尼
You want to tell me why you put a headstone on an empty grave, Maloney?

599
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,690
什麼墓碑  
What headstone?

一個你付了395美元買的  就在1965年
The one you paid $395 for back in 1965.

你到縣政府申請

605
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,030
而且你被拒絕了
and you were turned down.

606
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,820
-你要用信用卡支付嗎  -不
- You wanna give me your credit card?  - No.

607
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:01,050
信用卡被停用了
Credit cards are out.

608
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:11,430
跟你一樣  我喜歡付  現金
Like you, I prefer to pay... in cash.

609
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,750
這個是我個人最喜歡的
Now, this one happens to be my personal favorite.

610
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,960
是不是很高雅  
Isn't it exquisite?

611
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,830
對我來說太貴了
Probably too expensive for me.

612
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:42,990
我能幫你嗎  先生
Can I help you, sir?

613
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:51,570
抱歉  我馬上回來
Excuse me. I'll be right back. Uh, Mrs. Clay?

614
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,940
克萊兒女士  你能幫我  接待一下坎妮安女士嗎  
Would you take care of Mrs. Cunningham for a few moments?

615
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:58,670
好的  亞當森先生
Certainly, Mr. Adamson.

616

我擔心我太過喜歡了
I'm afraid I rather like it.

617
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,220
嘿  艾迪  你這狗娘養的
Hey, Eddie. You old son of a bitch.

618
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,990
如果對你來說都一樣  我比較喜歡叫亞瑟·亞當森
If it's all the same to you, I prefer Arthur Adamson.

619
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:13,730
你來這裡幹嘛  
Now what in the hell are you doing here?

- Couldrt you have phoned me?  - Some things you don't put on no telephone.

622
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,060
嘿  你有酒嗎  
Hey, uh, you got any booze around?

623
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,510
好吧  喬森  這次是什麼事  
All right, Joseph. What is it this time?

624
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:38,180
要買新的冰箱給你老婆  
New freezer for your wife?

625
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:42,120
老媽要做另一個手術  賭徒威脅要殺你  還是什麼  
Mother needs another operation? Bookies threatened to kill you? What?

626
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,960
嘿  艾迪  你把我說得好像寄生蟲
Aw, come on, Eddie. You make me sound like some kind of sponger.

627

我不是不感激你的幫助
Not that I ain't grateful for all your favors.

- Did I ever have a choice?  - Okay, okay. Here it is.

629
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,370
首先  我得問你一個問題
First off, I gotta ask you a question.

630
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:59,370
-問吧  -我問你  別廢話  艾迪
- Go ahead.  - I'm tellir ya. No shit now, Eddie.

631
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,730
你能想到什麼理由  這麼多年後  
Can you think of any reason why anyone would be sniffir around in your life...

632
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:03,330
怎麼會有人對你的生活感興趣
after all these years?

633
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:10,350
我想不出任何理由  怎麼了  
I can't think of any reason at all. Why?

634
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,890
今天有個傢伙來到車廠
Well, there's this guy comes around the garage today...

635
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:17,220
探問艾迪·休奎奇
tryir to locate Eddie Shoebridge.

636
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,520
他自稱是個律師  有個好消息帶給你
Claims he's a lawyer, he's got good news for ya.

637
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,360
沒說是什麼事  為誰工作
Wort say what, or who he's workir for.

638
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,850
只說他叫麥克布萊  我第一眼看到他就知道是說謊
Calls himself McBride. I know he's a phony the minute I see him.

639
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:29,000
-警察  -不  是業餘的
- Police?  - No way. He's a real amateur.

640
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,500
我追查他的車牌
I traced his license plates with the bureau...

641
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,270
也不是開他自己的車
Doesrt even drive his own car.

642
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:40,600
"布蘭琪·泰勒  城堡大道17號"
"Blanche Tyler, 17 Castle Heights Road."

643
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,250
-他長什麼樣子  -高瘦  大約35歲
- What did he look like?  - He's tall, thin, about 35.

644
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:50,120
他叼著一支煙斗  問許多自以為是的問題
He's always got a pipe on. Asking a lot of smart-ass questions.

645
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:55,530
-你告訴他什麼了  -什麼該死的都沒說
- What'd you tell him?  - Nothir. Not a goddamn thing.

646
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:57,530
我不需要說  他什麼都知道
I didn't have to. He knew everything...

647
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:59,870
你叫我幫你立的假墓碑
fake headstone you had me put up,

648
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,800
我如何試圖幫你申請死亡證明
how I tried to get you officially declared dead.

649
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,270
那狗娘養的還說了  他認為你還活著
The son of a bitch says he thinks you're still alive.

650
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:08,110
他在找你  艾迪
He's lookir for you, Eddie.

651
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:10,840
任何一個狗娘養的想找到你
And any son of a bitch who's lookir for you...

652
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,470
就會找上我
is lookir for me.

653
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,390
哦  
Well,

654
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:24,060
無論他有什麼行動  他不會找到我的
whatever he's up to, he won't find me.

655
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,790
你太過擔心了  喬森
You worry too much, Joseph.

656
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:30,060
是呀  我太過擔心  因為你只是策劃放火
Yeah, I worry too much, because you only planned the fire,

657
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:33,030
把老先生和老太太鎖在臥房裡
and locked your old man and old lady in the bedroom.

658
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:37,640
-是我淋汽油  我點燃抹布  -我很感謝你
- I poured the gasoline. I lit the rags.  - And I thank you.

659
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,470
那是我不光彩的童年當中  最快樂的一天
The happiest day of my whole, inglorious childhood.

660
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:44,980
好吧  你想繼續當孩子  我有我的做法
All right, you want to kid about it, it's all right with me.

661
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:49,070
-我要跟蹤這傢伙  -然後呢  
- I'm gonna track this guy down.  - And then what?

662
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,350
這個  
This.

663
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:58,790
-你永遠不會改變  是嗎  -你有沒有理由抱怨
- You'll never change, will you?  - You got no cause to complain.

664
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:01,870
當你需要我  我總是在那裡  
- When you needed me, I was always there, wasrt I?

665
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:04,000
聽著  把那東西拿開
- Look, put that thing away.

666
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,630
聽我說  我要你回巴洛溪
And listen to me. I want you to go back to Barlow Creek.

667
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,630
什麼都別做  什麼都別說
Do nothing, say nothing.

668
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:13,400
讓我自己來解決這件事  用平靜的方式
Let me look into this matter in my own, quiet way.

669
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:17,940
如果我需要你  我會和你聯絡
And if I need you for anything, I'll contact you.

670
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,440
好嗎  
Okay?

671
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:27,990
你是老闆  亞瑟
You're the boss, Arthur.

672
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:31,890
這很感人不是嗎  一個完美的謀殺  
Isn't it touching how... a perfect murder...

673
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:35,090
使我們的友誼  這些年來一直維繫著  
has kept our friendship alive all these years?

674
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:38,200
你最好相信
You better believe it.

675
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,870
抱歉  打擾了  亞當森先生
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Adamson.

676
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:45,390
有兩位先生找您  從警局來的
There are two gentlemen here to see you, from the police department.

677
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,840
告訴他們  我馬上來
Tell them I'll be right out.

678
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,010
老天  艾迪
Jesus Christ, Eddie!

679
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:54,440
在這兒等著
Wait here.

680
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:11,500
-我是亞瑟·亞當森  能為您效勞  -抱歉  打擾您
- Arthur Adamson. What can I do for you gentlemen?  - Sorry to bother you.

681
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:15,300
我是安迪·布希檢察官  這位是彼得森副官
Andy Bush, Bureau of Inspectors, and this is Lieutenant Peterson.

682
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,300
-嗨  -我的榮幸
- Hi.  - My pleasure.

683
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:21,310
毫無疑問  你一定讀過或聽說過  康斯坦丁綁架案
No doubt you've been reading, or hearing, about the Constantine kidnapping.

684
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:23,610
哦  我必須承認  檢察官
Well, I have a confession to make, Inspector.

685
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:26,710
當我聽到那寶石的大小  我都流口水了
When I heard of the size of that stone, my mouth watered.

686
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:29,480
專業來說
Professionally speaking, of course.

687
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,120
希望你不要感到受歧視  亞當森先生
Well, just so you don't feel discriminated against, Mr. Adamson,

688
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:37,490
我們只是對城裡的每個珠寶商  和銀樓做例行性詢問
we're routinely covering every gem dealer and jewelry store in the city.

689
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:40,490
哦  我受寵若驚
Well, I'm flattered.

690
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:45,530
你有許多機會去接觸  有注意到什麼不尋常嗎  
Have you, by any chance, noticed anything out of the ordinary, Mr. Adamson?

691
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:48,730
有任何異常的大小寶石  
Any unusual movement of large... or small...

692
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,140
在過去幾天流入市面
stones into the markets these last few days?

693
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:54,140
-絕對沒有  -我明白了
- Absolutely not.  - I see.

694
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,800
我認為你們可以假設這個  嗯  
I take it that you're going on the assumption...

695
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,310
"贓物"已經被切割成較小的寶石
that this, uh, "ransom stone" has been cut up into smaller gems?

696
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:02,410
-有道理  先生  -這樣更有銷路
- That's correct, sir.  - It makes a lot of sense.

697
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,450
我們也是這麼認為
We think so.

698
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:07,020
如果可以  恕我冒昧地提出一項建議
If I may presume to make a suggestion,

699
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:11,420
在我看來  你們應該涵蓋  古董商和二手珠寶市場
it seems to me you ought to be covering the antique and secondhand jewelry markets.

700
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:16,630
他們從任何人那裡購買  而我們只向專業珠寶批發商買貨
They buy from anyone, whereas we jewelers buy exclusively on the wholesale exchanges.

701
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:19,870
-我們已經這麼做了  亞當森先生  -喔
- That's already being done, Mr. Adamson.  - Oh!

702
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:23,270
我認為我們已經佔用  亞當森先生太多時間了
I think we've taken up enough of Mr. Adamsors time.

703
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:26,670
很抱歉  我沒能給你們  太多的幫助
Well, I'm sorry I haven't been able to be of more help to you.

704
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:31,380
不過  如果我有聽到任何  不尋常的市場交易
However, if I do hear of any unusual transactions in the marketplace,

705
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,380
我一定會與您聯繫
I'll be sure and contact you.

706
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:37,320
-好的  不勝感激  再見  -保重
- Yes, we'd appreciate that. Much obliged.  - Take care.

707
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,810
-再見  先生  -祝你們好運
- Good-bye, sir.  - Good day. And good luck!

708
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,970
克萊兒女士  你可以關門了  我還有一些工作要做
Mrs. Clay, close up as soon as you wish. I have some work to do in here.

709
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:03,240
我會從後門離開
I'll let myself out the back way.

710
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,680
-晚安  -晚安
- Good night.  - Good night.

711
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:18,650
-你的朋友布蘭琪·泰勒是個靈媒  -靈媒  
- Your friend, Blanche Tyler, is a spiritualist.  - A spiritualist?

712
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:23,020
招牌上是這麼寫的  但沒有人在家
That's what it says on her shingle. Also, there's no one home.

713
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:26,550
靈魂是永遠不會在家的  上車
A spirit is never at home. Get in.

714
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,900
你認為我們該怎麼辦  
What do you think we should do?

715
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:37,840
我們等待  我們仍然不知道那男的是誰
We'll wait. We still don't know who the man is yet.

716
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,270
-非抽不可  -嗯哼
- Must you?  - Mm-hmm.

717
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,650
那一定是她
That must be her.

718
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:28,050
那個叼著煙斗的  肯定就是去找馬洛尼的人
That must be the fellow with the pipe who called on Maloney.

719
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:30,020
一個計程車司機
A cab driver.

720
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,790
魯尼  魯尼  怎麼回事  你要去哪兒  
Lumley. Lumley, what's this? Where are ya goir?

721
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:35,990
我要回家躺在自己的床上  可以好好睡個覺
I'm going home to my own bed where I can get some sleep.

722
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:37,600
不  你不會的
No, you're not.

723
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,470
布蘭琪  你不能每件事  都要順著你的意
Blanche, is that all you've ever got on your mind?

724
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,900
你留著要幹嘛  未雨綢繆  
What are you saving it for, a rainy day?

725
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,990
親愛的  你永遠不會知道  什麼時候會需要它
Honey, you never know when you're gonna need it.

726
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,210
你很不體貼  魯尼
You're not being friendly, Lumley.

727
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:51,410
布蘭琪  我已經精疲力盡了  我對你是沒利用價值的
Blanche, I'm too pooped to pop. I'd be useless to you.

728
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:53,780
你對我總是毫無用處
You're always useless to me!

729
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:57,320
當我需要你時  你總是精疲力盡
You're always pooping out when I need you!

730
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,220
我們可以賺一大筆錢  你說這是毫無用處  
we can collect a huge sum of money, You call that useless?

731
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:03,420
你知道我在說什麼  來  進屋吧  別吵了
You know what I'm talking about. Come on in side and stop being difficult.

732
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,560
今晚不行  我不會留在這兒
Not tonight, Josephine. I'm outta here.

733
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:05,970
你這個懶蟲  
You're a fink!

734
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:07,050
如果我是懶蟲  你就是一個忘恩負義的婊子
If I'm a fink, you're an ungrateful bitch.

735
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:12,060
-那明天呢  -怎樣  
- What about tomorrow?  - What about it?

736
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:15,470
你有重要的工作要做  我要你確認誰是艾迪·休奎  
You've got important work to do. I want you to be sure about Eddie Shoe...

737
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:17,800
跟他說
Talk to him!

738
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,210
你要告訴我多少次  
How many times are you going to tell me that?

739
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:25,180
我又要告訴你多少次  我明天的工作是開計程車  
How many times am I gonna have to tell you that tomorrow I have to work in my cab?

740
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:27,640
所以要等到禮拜天
So it'll wait till Sunday.

741
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:48,400
你最好給我一個簡要  我一頭霧水
You better give me a quick synopsis. I'm confused.

742
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,740
很簡單  一個疲憊的計程車司機
Simple. A cab driver is shacked up...

743
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,200
和一個性飢渴的靈媒  布蘭琪·泰勒
with a sex-starved medium named Blanche Tyler.

744
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,550
別問我為什麼  但很顯然  
Don't ask me why, but apparently they're on the trail...

745
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:57,910
他們找到了艾迪·休奎奇的幽靈
of some spook named Eddie Shoebridge.

746
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:02,080
幸運的是  不是在追蹤  你最喜歡的"贓物"和我
Fortunately, not on the trail of your favorite kidnapper and mine.

747
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,080
你怎麼能那麼肯定  
How can you be so sure?

748
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,050
你也聽到了  他們談論到將賺一大筆錢
You did hear him talk about collecting a huge hunk of money.

749
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:09,920
那報酬不是在我們頭上  
Couldrt that be the reward that's on our heads?

750
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,520
你說到重點了  法蘭西大姊
You got yourself a point there, Frances, old girl.

751
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,430
只有時間才能告訴我們  是好是壞
Only time will tell whether it's any good.

752
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:17,430
但有一件事是肯定的
One thing's certain.

753
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:21,460
我們不會改變我們的計劃  不會是現在
We're not going to change our game plan. Not now.

754
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:25,100
買瓶酒給我  亞瑟
Buy me a drink, Arthur.

755
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:28,070
一輛閃亮的車
A shiny car.

756
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:30,940
一輛豪華轎車  
A... limousine?

757
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:33,450
他為什麼要開得這麼快  亨利  
Why does he drive so fast, Henry?

758
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,510
那是什麼  在他旁邊座位上的  
What's that? On the seat beside him?

759
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:42,150
我聽到嬰兒的哭聲  快  亨利  在他消失前
I hear the sound of a baby crying. Quick, Henry, before he disappears.

760
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:45,520
問他  是的  我明白
Ask...Yes, I know.

761
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,930
我  看到他了
I...see him now.

762
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:53,770
穿著制服  一個司機
The uniform. A chauffeur.

763
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:56,470
什麼  亨利  我要聽他說話
What? Henry, I need words.

764
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:58,470
誰  什麼  
Who? The what?

765
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:01,840
蘭伯特家的司機  
The Rainbird chauffeur?

766
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:05,540
天哪  老麥克·歐基夫  我們的司機
Good heavens. Old Michael O'Keefe, our chauffeur.

767
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:08,410
麥克要去哪裡  
Where is Michael going?

768
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:12,480
亨利  問他把哈麗葉的嬰兒  帶去哪裡  
Henry, ask him where he's taking Harriet's baby.

769
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,290
噢  有太多影像  閃得太快了
Oh, more pictures are coming in too fast.

770
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:18,060
我看不清楚
I can hardly make them out.

771
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:21,430
亨利  墓地  一個墓碑  
Henry, a graveyard, a headstone?

772
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,860
我不喜歡這樣  亨利
I don't like this, Henry.

773
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,870
鞋子  橋  
A shoe. Bridge.

774
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:31,100
鞋子橋  噢  不要這樣對我  亨利
A shoe bridge? Oh, don't do this to me, Henry.

775
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,770
-對司機說話  -噢  上帝  有東西在燃燒
- Speak to the chauffeur.  - Oh, God, something's burning.

776
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:38,780
是房子  快  亨利  房子著火了
The house. Quick, Henry. The house is on fire.

777
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:41,180
帶我離開這裡
Take me away from here.

778
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:43,210
我不想看這些
I don't want to see this.

779
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:46,890
我受不了他們可怕的尖叫聲
I can't bear the sound of their awful screaming.

780
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:50,120
回到司機那裡  亨利  讓麥克加入我們
Go back to the chauffeur, Henry. Get Michael into our presence.

781
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,220
蘭伯特女士記得他
Miss Rainbird remembers him.

782
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:55,390
是的  我記得
Yes, I remember.

783
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:58,130
布蘭琪夫人  讓我來說
Madame Blanche, listen to me.

784
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:02,030
你能聽到我嗎  
Can you hear me?

785
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:06,170
我想起一件事  這非常重要
I've remembered something else that could be terribly important.

786
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:09,610
等一下  亨利  在你走之前
Wait one minute, Henry. Before you go,

787
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:13,910
蘭伯特女士需要知道  哈麗葉孩子的情況
Miss Rainbird deserves some kind of assurance about Harriet's child.

788
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:16,680
他現在是個大人了
He's a man by now,

789
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:20,150
我們想知道他現在快樂嗎  
and we have to know, is he happy, Henry?

790
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:23,880
他還活著嗎  過得幸福嗎  
Is he alive and well and happy?

791
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:27,590
如果你不能  
If you can't, you can't.

792
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:30,360
我當然不能強迫你
I certainly can't force you.

793
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:34,500
是  當然  她會理解的
Yes. Of course she'll understand.

794
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:38,700
直到下一次  那麼  再見了
Until next time, then. Good-bye.

795
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,140
再見  親愛的
Good-bye, my love.

796
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,270
-發生什麼事  -難道你不記得了  
- What happened?  - Don't you remember?

797
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:52,550
-並不太愉快  -噢  沒關係了
- Not a blessed thing.  - Oh, it doesn't matter now.

798
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:55,090
聽著  聽著  布蘭琪夫人
Listen, listen, Madame Blanche.

799
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:59,790
你的亨利拾回了  我完全遺忘的記憶
Your Henry jogged my memory of something I'd completely forgotten.

800
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:03,930
當我們可憐的老司機麥克  意識到他即將死亡時
When our poor old chauffeur, Mike, realized he was dying,

801
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:08,130
他寫信給我  說世上有個人  
he wrote to me and said there was one person on earth...

802
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:11,040
他許下承諾說
who had promised that he'd make it his business...

803
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:15,540
只要他還活著  就能夠知道哈麗葉的兒子在哪兒
to know where Harriet's son was as long as he lived.

804
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:20,810
是個牧師  幫新生嬰兒洗禮的
It was the parson who baptized the newborn baby.

805
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:24,080
還有一件事我要告訴你  
And there's an additional thing I can tell you.

806
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:28,250
別告訴我  讓我猜猜看
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

807
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:31,790
-500美元  -沒錢  連100也沒有
- Five hundred.  - Not a penny. Not even a hundred for expenses.

808
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:33,790
這是全有或全無  喬治
It's all or nothing, George,

809
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:36,330
直到我可以找出  他的名字和現在的住址
until I can produce his name and his present address.

810
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:40,530
-老天  布蘭琪  -不過  她給了我一條重大線索
- Jesus, Blanche.  - However, she gave me a marvelous clue.

811
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:43,500
-我們又來了  -不  是你有得忙了  
- Here we go again.  - No, here you go again...

812
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:46,540
有一個人可以告訴你  休奎奇是生是死
to the man who might tell you if Shoebridge is dead or alive.

813
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:50,680
-那是誰  -聖安塞爾姆大教堂的伍德主教
- Who's that?  - Bishop Wood at St. Anselm's Cathedral.

814
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,610
-老天爺  布蘭琪  -不  喬治  不是祂
- Holy Christ, Blanche.  - No, George, not him.

815
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:56,250
是聖安塞爾姆大教堂的伍德主教
Bishop Wood at St. Anselm's Cathedral.

816
01:00:56,250 --> 01:01:00,680
他曾經是一個牧師  替嬰兒時期的休奎奇受洗過
He was a parson once and he baptized the Shoebridge baby.

817
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,930
打擾一下
Excuse me.

818
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:56,310
抱歉
Sorry.

819
01:01:56,310 --> 01:02:00,710
你知道我要怎樣  才能約見伍德主教  
Do you know how I could, uh, make a date to see Bishop Wood?

820
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:05,780
如果你想今天約見  你必須先找牧師
If you want to make the appointment today, you'll have to make it through the chaplain.

821
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:08,350
哪一個是牧師  
Which one is the chaplain?

822
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:11,620
禮拜結束後  我會帶你去的
When the service is over, I'll show you where to go.

823
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:38,640
噢  親愛的
Oh, dear.

824
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:22,520
你知道他還在動  你確定給他的用量足夠  
You know he's moving. You sure you gave him enough?

825
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:26,260
只是一般的劑量  他看起來無害
Just the usual dose. He looks so harmless.

826
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:29,430
當我還是個孩子時  住在這個村莊
When I was a little kid living in that village,

827
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:32,300
他總是讓我覺得  我是個邪惡的東西
he always made me feel like I was something evil.

828
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:36,230
-看看我現在  -我覺得年輕了幾歲
- And look at me now.  - I feel years younger.

829
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:39,400
你知道  多一個像這樣的今天  我們將一臉土灰
You know, one more like this one today, and we'll be naturally gray.

830
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:43,740
這是一個令人難以置信的工作  我真的認為這超過100萬
It was an incredible job. I really think it's won'th more than a million.

831
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:46,430
抱歉  親愛的  但我可不想回去  重寫我的贖金紙條
I'm sorry, darling, but I'm not going back...

832
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:49,250
那將背離了我的祈禱書
and rewrite my ransom note that I left in my prayer book.

833
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:52,280
你必須好好動一動  去解決這100萬
You'll have to be a good sport and settle for a million.

834
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:54,990
你很漂亮  法蘭  很漂亮
You were beautiful, Fran. Just beautiful.

835
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:58,790
-我很害怕  -我告訴過你沒問題的  不是嗎  
- I was scared.  - I told you it'd be all right, didn't I?

836
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:01,560
人們在教堂是很守禮節的
People in church are inibited.

837
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,870
他們不會跳起來亂跑  或是製造噪音  
They don't jump up and run around and make a lot of noise.

838
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:06,100
他們都虔誠有禮
They're all too religiously polite.

839
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:10,970
我們要繼續自我陶醉  或是你想談談他呢  
Shall we go on congratulating ourselves, or would you like to talk about him now?

840
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:13,700
-誰  -誰  
- Who?  - "Who."

841
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,410
那個叼著煙斗的男人
The man with the pipe.

842
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:20,680
-你看到他在那裡  -如影隨形
- So you saw him there, huh?  - Larger than life.

843
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,680
比死亡還難纏
Larger than death, you mean.

844
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,980
他現在追求的毫無疑問了
There's no doubt about who he's after now.

845
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:27,280
你打算怎麼處理他  親愛的
What were you planning to do about him, dear,

846
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,520
除了不想告訴我的以外  
besides just not telling me?

847
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,060
我不打算對他做任何事情
I'm not planning to do anything about him.

848
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:36,630
喬森·馬洛尼渴望的那份工作  現在他得到了
Joe Maloney's been itching for that job. He's got it.

849
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:40,300
我會打電話給他  等我把我們的客人安置好後
I'll phone him as soon as we put our guest in his quarters.

850
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:43,730
我說得對  那計程車司機真傻
I was right about that silly cab driver.

851
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:46,340
在我的生命裡  這次我討厭說對了
For once in my life I hate being right.

852
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,690
他怎麼會知道我們要去那裡  
Well, how in the hell could he have known we were going to be there...

853
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:51,210
除了你和我  世上還有誰會知道
when you and I are the only two people in the world who knew that?

854
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:53,210
我有一個想法
I've got a thought.

855
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:55,880
-就是有點愚蠢  -說吧
- It's a dumb one.  - Say it.

856
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,010
你相信特異功能嗎  
Do you believe in E.S.P.?

857
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:01,420
特異功能  超常的心靈現象
Extra sensory perception, all that psychic phenomena?

858
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:04,320
什麼意思  是說那個叫什麼的夫人  
What do you mean? Madame What's-her-name?

859
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,820
布蘭琪·泰勒
Blanche Tyler.

860
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,090
老天
Jesus.

861
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:14,500
你和我都知道這一面牆  但我們能犯錯嗎  
You and I know that that's off the wall, but, uh, can we afford to be wrong?

862
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:20,040
恐怕我們的那對歡喜冤家  將會共同發生一起致命的事故
I'm afraid our two quarrelsome lovers are going to have to share a fatal accident.

863
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,470
噢  我的天啊
Oh, my God.

864
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:25,780
但馬洛尼不會這麼做的  對吧  
But Maloney wouldn't be willing to do that, would he?

865
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:29,550
當然  他會很樂意做的
Of course he'd be willing. Gladly.

866
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:33,550
他會相信那是為了保護自己  和他的老夥伴
He'd believe he was protecting himself and his old buddy.

867
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:36,550
我不想知道  好嗎  
I don't want to know about it. Okay?

868
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:39,760
-答應我  亞瑟  -拜託  親愛的
- Promise me, Arthur.  - Come on, now, dear.

869
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,130
這有什麼好激動的
That's what's so exciting about all of this.

870
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:47,190
我們同生共死  沒有什麼好退縮的
We move as one. Everything together. Nothing held back.

871
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:22,130
這是嚴重的疏失  就這樣失去他  他是我們的所有
It was gross negligence, losing him that way. He was all we had.

872
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:25,070
我沒有失去他  他只是被綁架
I didn't lose him. He was kidnapped.

873
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:30,740
為什麼會有人對主教幹這種事  
Why would anyone want to do that to a bishop?

874
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:34,370
為了贖金啊  傻瓜  那可是100萬美元
For the ransom, dummy. It's a million dollars.

875
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:41,920
我無能為力  你知道  我就在那兒
I can't get over it. You know, I was right there.

876
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:46,650
噢  忘了那100萬吧  我們的一萬該怎麼辦  
Tsk. Oh, forget about the million. What about out 10,000?

877
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:51,590
我們現在無路可走  魯尼
We've got nowhere to go now, Lumley.

878
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,400
我該怎麼告訴蘭伯特女士  
What am I gonna tell Miss Rainbird?

879
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,100
看來我和亨利又得費盡心力  
I suppose Henry and I are going to have to exhaust ourselves

880
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:00,040
來補原本該是你的工作
again doing your work for you.

881
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:03,560
什麼意思  我的工作  我的工作是駕駛該死的計程車
What d'ya mean, my work? My work is driving a goddamn cab, for Christ's sake.

882
01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:07,040
看在上帝的分上  從這一分鐘開始  做點正確的  
And startir right this minute, that's exact...

883
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:10,410
-正確的什麼  繼續說  -接電話
- That's exact what? Go ahead.  - Answer the telephone.

884
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:18,590
哈羅  誰  
Hello? Who?

885
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:20,720
馬洛尼先生  
Mr. Maloney?

886
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,930
巴洛溪  請繼續
Barlow Creek? Go ahead.

887
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:27,060
哈羅
Hello.

888
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:29,700
你能說大聲一點嗎  馬洛尼先生
Can you speak a little louder, Mr. Maloney?

889
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:32,150
我說我透過你那律師朋友  
I said I traced you through the license plates on

890
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,240
駕駛的車牌號碼追查到你
that car your lawyer friend was driving.

891
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,340
我猜你仍然想尋找艾迪·休奎奇
I figured if you was still lookir for some dope on Eddie Shoebridge,

892
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:39,840
-我可以給你一點情報  -哦
- I might have somethir for you.  - Oh.

893
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:42,610
你為什麼改變主意了  馬洛尼先生  
How come you changed your mind, Mr. Maloney?

894
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:44,500
我沒和你的人說  
I didn't say nothir to your man

895
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,820
是因為我覺得不關我的事
'cause I felt it was none of my business and none of his,

896
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:49,320
但我一直在想  我可以因此賺點外快
but I been thinkir about it and how I could use the bread.

897
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:52,020
因此考慮過後  我願意帶你去見一個人
So for a little consideration, I'm willing to lead you to someone...

898
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:54,160
他認識艾迪·休奎奇的太太
who knows Eddie Shoebridge's wife.

899
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:57,130
你得付一大筆錢
It'll cost you a grand.

900
01:07:57,130 --> 01:07:59,860
喔  別傻了  馬洛尼先生
Oh, don't be silly, Mr. Maloney.

901
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:02,070
我的律師就在我的身邊
I have my lawyer right here beside me,

902
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:06,830
他說願意付你100美元  只要能找到人
and he says he'll give you $100 provided it leads to something. Make it two.

903
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:12,410
喔  好吧  成交
Oh... All right. It's a deal.

904
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:14,940
-我們在哪碰面  -你和你的律師朋友  
- Where do we meet?  - You and that lawyer friend of yours,

905
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:17,750
你們開車來  兩個小時後在梅布斯見面
you drive up and meet me at Abe and Mabel's in two hours.

906
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:22,590
-梅布斯  -是路邊咖啡屋  在榭爾曼路上
- Abe and Mabel's?  - It's a cafe up the road to Mt. Sherman,

907
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:26,480
進入22號公路後大約五英哩  你知道哪裡嗎  
about five miles off Route 22. You know where it is?

908
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:29,990
知道  為什麼到那麼遠  我們不能找個更方便的地方嗎  
Yeah. Why so far away? Can't we meet somewhere more convenient?

909
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:33,660
我要帶你去的派對就在那邊
This party I'm gonna take you to happens to be up in that area.

910
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:37,830
我明白了  馬洛尼先生  你肯定艾迪·休奎奇還活著  
I see. Mr. Maloney, are you admitting Edward Shoebridge is still alive?

911
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:41,200
兩個小時後  我看到白花花的鈔票再說
I ain't sayir a thing till I see the color of your money, in two hours.

912
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,780
-你怎麼想  -我聞到魚腥味
- What d'ya think?  - Smells fishy to me.

913
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:48,780
我知道
I know.

914
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:52,480
但是當你快餓死時  甚至魚腥味都會覺得好
But even fish smells good when you're starving to death.

915
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:55,420
我們會有什麼損失  他是唯一的線索
What have we got to lose? He's the only clue left.

916
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:59,060
你有200美元嗎  
You got $200 on you?

917
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,060
你比我更清楚
You know me better than that.

918
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:05,230
當然沒有  再給我一個
Of course not. Fix me another one of these.

919
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:07,760
你不需要  你已經有一個了  
You don't need another one. You already got one.

920
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,630
我們只有兩個小時去那裡
We only got two hours to get there.

921
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:12,800
-我要在車上吃  -走吧
- I'll eat it in the car.  - Come on.

922
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,170
你真難應付
You're impossible.

923
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:50,670
兩杯啤酒  麻煩
A couple of beers, please.

924
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:58,760
他遲到了
He must be late.

925
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:25,500
謝謝
Thank you, dear.

926
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:38,210
孩子們  去坐那邊
You kids sit over there.

927
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:49,030
-哦  今天週日的學校如何  -吵死了
- How was Sunday school today?  - Noisy.

928
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:51,790
-五瓶可樂  麻煩  -我們沒有吵啊
- Five Cokes, please.  - We didn't make any noise.

929
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:53,800
這就對了  所以你才在這裡
That's right. That's why you're here.

930
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,590
不要怪我
Don't blame me.

931
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:24,030
我有說什麼嗎  
Did I say anything?

932
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:34,000
-你好  抱歉  我遲到了  -我幫你搬張椅子
- Hello. I'm sorry I'm late.  - I'll get you a chair.

933
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,440
-沒關係  我坐這兒  -我和你坐一起
- That's all right. I'll sit over here.  - I'll join you.

934
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:48,350
瞧  好手段
Look at that. Nice arrangement.

935
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:51,480
別下流了  喬治
Don't be obscene, George.

936
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,400
喔
Oh.

937
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,400
謝謝  親愛的
Thank you, my dear.

938
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:12,000
讓頭腦保持清醒  好嗎  
Just see that you keep you head screwed on straight, will you?

939
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:26,090
他不會來了
He's not coming.

940
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:43,700
噢  就這樣結束了
Well, that's the end of that.

941
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:58,180
喬治  在急什麼  
George, what's the big hurry?

942
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:06,360
開慢一點  好嗎  
Just slow down a little, will ya, please?

943
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:11,330
我說了別開那麼快  喬治
I told you not to drive so fast, George!

944
01:15:11,330 --> 01:15:14,420
我不知道怎麼回事  油門好像卡住了
I don't know what's wrong. The accelerator seems to be sticking.

945
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,170
喬治  看在老天的份上  開慢點  好嗎  
George, for God's sake, slow up, will ya?

946
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:21,240
我做不到
I can't.

947
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,670
我的漢堡快要吐出來了
My hamburger's coming up.

948
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:26,610
油門  卡住了
The accelerator... is stuck.

949
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:29,080
踩煞車
Use the brakes!

950
01:15:31,310 --> 01:15:33,750
-沒反應  -什麼  
- They don't work.  - What?

951
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:38,310
-煞車沒反應  -什麼意思  
- The brakes don't work.  - What do you mean?

952
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,930
-喬治  -拜託  別抓我  看在老天的份上
- George!  - Come on, woman. Don't grab me, for God's sake!

953
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:48,100
不是我  是煞車壞了
It's not me. It's the brakes don't work.

954
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:51,900
我快得心臟病了  喬治
I'm getting violently ill, George.

955
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:55,740
-你快讓我窒息了  布蘭琪  老天  -喬治
- You're chokir me, Blanche, for Christ's sake!  - George!

956
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:59,140
快想辦法
Do something!

957
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:09,150
拉手煞車  伸手拉手煞車
Grab the brake! Reach down and pull the hand brake.

958
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:11,250
-快拉  -我在拉了
- Pull on it!  - I am pulling!

959
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:13,420
你的手別抓方向盤  快拉
Get your hands off the steering wheel. Pull on it!

960
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:15,860
-我在拉了  -快拉
- I am pulling.  - Pull it.

961
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:20,090
快啊
Come on.

962
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,930
你的手別抓方向盤  該死的
Get your hand off the goddamn wheel!

963
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:09,630
我得離開這條路
I gotta get off this road.

964
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:14,710
布蘭琪  堅持住
Blanche, just hang on.

965
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:31,190
有趣嗎  
Wasrt that fun?

966
01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:34,530
-去你的  喬治·魯尼  -你吃錯藥啦  
- Damn you, George Lumley!  - What's the matter with you?

967
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:37,300
-不是我  是馬洛尼  -開車的不是他
- It was't me. It's Maloney.  - He was't driving!

968
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:40,340
那當然  是他對車動了手腳  弄壞了煞車
Of course, but he screwed up the car and broke the brakes.

969
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:42,710
-馬洛尼  -沒錯
- Maloney?  - Yes.

970
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:45,910
你認為這是巧合  布蘭琪  
You think it's a coincidence, Blanche?

971
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:48,340
嗯  
Huh?

972
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:54,080
你的車  可能要大修幾天了
Your car... is gonna be out of commission for a couple days.

973
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:58,280
我們想個辦法回家吧
So let's go find us another way to get home.

974
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:02,930
喬治  你沒事吧  
George. Are you all right?

975
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:06,700
嗯  我想是吧  你呢  
Mm-hmm. I think so. How about you?

976
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:10,530
我很好  對不起
I'm okay. I'm sorry.

977
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:16,940
-你真的認為馬洛尼要我們死  -嗯哼
- Do you really think Maloney wanted us dead?  - Mm-hmm.

978
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:22,180
為什麼  老天  為何有人會想這樣對我們  
Why, in the name of God, would anyone want to do that to us?

979
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:24,180
我不知道
I don't know,

980
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:28,220
但可以打賭  肯定和你那個  神秘的朋友艾迪·休奎奇有關
but you can bet is has something to do with your mysterious friend, Eddie Shoebridge.

981
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:30,990
或許馬洛尼就把他埋在他家後院
Maloney's probably got him buried in his backyard.

982
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:34,220
不希望被我們給找到
Doesrt want us to find out.

983
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,920
那邊
That way.

984
01:20:41,990 --> 01:20:43,990
你好  抱歉  遲到了
Hi there. Sorry I'm late.

985
01:20:43,990 --> 01:20:47,760
恭喜你對我們的車幹的好事  做得很完美  馬洛尼
Congratulations on the nice job you did on our car, Maloney.

986
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,970
為什麼你們倆要站在路中間  
What are you two doir standir in the middle of the road?

987
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:54,040
你明知我們為何站在路上  馬洛尼
You know perfectly well what we're doing on the road, Maloney.

988
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:57,570
你一定就是布蘭琪·泰勒  很高興見到你  你的車子呢  
You must be Blanche Tyler. Pleased to meet ya. Where's your car?

989
01:20:57,570 --> 01:21:00,680
這麼說吧  它不太聽話  你明白我的意思吧  
Let's just say it ain't in runnir order, you know what I mean?

990
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:02,880
上車  我載你們到最近的車站
Hop in. I'll give ya a lift to the nearest station.

991
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:06,310
不  謝了  我們不坐靈車
No, thank you. We don't ride in hearses.

992
01:21:07,450 --> 01:21:09,450
你以為我是來這裡玩的  
You think I came up here for the fun of it?

993
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:12,120
是你要我帶你去派對  那人認識艾迪·休奎奇的太太啊
Then you want me to take you to this party that knows Eddie Shoebridge's wife.

994
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:17,620
你為什麼不繼續前進  自己走吧  馬洛尼  我們當沒看到
Why don't you just go ahead, uh, by yourself this time, Maloney. We'll skip it.

995
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:30,140
他真是迷人
He's all charm.

996
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:16,690
那是誰  
Who's that?

997
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:19,520
是馬洛尼  他跟著我們
That's Maloney. He's after us.

998
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,790
快點
Come on.

999
01:22:31,270 --> 01:22:33,700
嘿  夥計們  我們快閃
Hey, guys, let's get the hell outta here.

1000
01:23:03,130 --> 01:23:05,600
我們最好通知警察
We better get the police.

1001
01:23:07,670 --> 01:23:10,100
然後損失我們的一萬美元  
And lose our $10,000?

1002
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:40,000
我能幫你嗎  夫人
May I be of some help to you, madam?

1003
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,240
-我想看一些手鐲  -要特定款式嗎  
- I'd like to see some bracelets.  - Any particular kind?

1004
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:48,400
你有綠寶石或珍珠的嗎  
Do you have anything with turquoise, or perhaps pearls?

1005
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:58,920
-我們的客人還好嗎  -他很好
- Anything wrong with our houseguest?  - He's fine.

1006
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:03,490
我給了他一頓豐盛的午餐  和一瓶新產的紅酒
I gave him a very nice lunch and a fresh bottle of wine.

1007
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:07,430
-或許這其中一條會吸引你  -這些是海洋珍珠  
- Maybe one of these will appeal to you?  - Are those seed pearls?

1008
01:24:07,430 --> 01:24:09,860
是的
That's right.

1009
01:24:12,770 --> 01:24:17,100
-你來這裡幹嘛  -這些看起來像淡水珍珠
- What are you doing here?  - These look like freshwater pearls.

1010
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,710
有消息傳來
The message has come through on KFAG.

1011
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:23,510
他們已經準備好  我們所提出的寶石了
They've located the stone we asked for.

1012
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:25,880
在紐約溫士頓
In New York. Harry Winston.

1013
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:28,320
53克拉
Fifty-three carats.

1014
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:33,290
這些都很好  多少錢  
These are very nice. How much are they?

1015
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:37,930
315美元  含稅
$315, including tax.

1016
01:24:37,930 --> 01:24:40,530
我們什麼時候行動  
When do we make the pickup?

1017
01:24:40,530 --> 01:24:43,370
明晚9:30
Tomorrow night, 9:30.

1018
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:46,770
好的  現在回家吧
Good. Now go on home.

1019
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:49,670
你能不能把這些先預留下來
Would it be possible for you to set these aside...

1020
01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:51,940
以便我可以帶丈夫過來看看  
so that I can bring in my husband and he can look at them?

1021
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:53,940
當然可以  夫人
Of course, madam.

1022
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:57,710
還有一個壞消息
Now for the bad news.

1023
01:24:57,710 --> 01:24:59,480
看看這個
Take a look at this.

1024
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:17,430
沒用的廢物  他搞砸了
Incompetent bastard. He blew it.

1025
01:25:17,430 --> 01:25:21,200
現在我們得自己去幹掉他們
Now we'll have to eliminate these two ourselves.

1026
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:24,540
-我們  -沒錯
- Ourselves?  - That's right.

1027
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:28,370
明晚  等我們把客人送走後
Tomorrow night, right after we return our guest.

1028
01:25:29,810 --> 01:25:32,540
-我不行  -你必須做
- I can't.  - You must.

1029
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:38,820
記著  共謀等同於主謀
Remember: Share and share alike.

1030
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:42,920
你別說了  別說了
You stop it! Stop it!

1031
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,870
-決定了嗎  -這個好
- Decide on something?  - That'll be fine.

1032
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:52,000
我要這一個
I'll have it wrapped.

1033
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,740
但不僅如此  遠遠不止於此
But it was more than that, much more than that...

1034
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:59,780
你留下了生命中珍貴的禮物
that you left behind as your precious gift to life.

1035
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:04,450
是的  喬森·馬洛尼  你是一個慷慨的人
Yes, Joseph Maloney, you were a generous man.

1036
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:06,950
你獻出了你的心和靈魂
You gave of your heart and soul.

1037
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:09,580
你獻出了最好的你
You gave the very best that was in you,

1038
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:13,760
凡世上無人比你付出的更多
and no more than that can be asked of mortal man on this earth.

1039
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,630
你深愛你的妻子
You loved your wife dearly.

1040
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:19,700
你給予你親愛的母親和父親
You bestowed upon your dear mother and father...

1041
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:23,430
所有的照料  所有的關心
all the care, all the attention,

1042
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:28,190
在他們的晚年  給予他們需要的耐心和安慰
patience and comfort that they needed... in the sunset of their lives.

1043
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:31,510
我們這些留下的人們
And those of us who are left behind...

1044
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:34,040
為你而哀傷  喬森
to grieve for you, Joseph,

1045
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:38,010
只能遵從上帝的決定
can only bow to the divine judgement of our Lord,

1046
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:41,620
誰選擇了帶你遠離我們
who has chosen to take you away from us...

1047
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:45,220
在一場殘酷的意外
in this cruel accident.

1048
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:48,820
喔  神聖偉大的主啊
Oh, how great the holiness of our God.

1049
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:51,790
祂擁有一切智慧
For He knoweth all things.

1050
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:55,600
祂無所不知
And there is not anything save He knows it.

1051
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:58,500
祂來到了這個世界
And He cometh into the world...

1052
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:04,310
祂可以拯救世人  如果他們能去傾聽祂的聲音
that He may save all men if they will harken unto His voice.

1053
01:27:04,310 --> 01:27:08,410
因為祂看到了世人遭受的痛苦
For behold, He suffered that the pains of all men.

1054
01:27:08,410 --> 01:27:12,280
是的  每一個活著的生命  都在遭受痛苦
Yea, the pains of every living creature,

1055
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:15,080
男人  女人和孩童  
both men, women and children...

1056
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,400
你就不能讓我獨自一人嗎  
Can't you leave me alone?

1057
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,740
你殺了他還不夠嗎  
Isn't it enough that you killed him?

1058
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:37,440
並非如此  馬洛尼太太  事情正好相反
That's not so, Mrs. Maloney. It was the other way.

1059
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:40,440
是你  是你來這裡之後  開始了一切
You. You started it all coming here...

1060
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:43,150
並且在你那交易中  把事情搞得一團糟
and messing in things that were none of your business.

1061
01:27:43,150 --> 01:27:45,750
請走開  拜託
Now go away. Please!

1062
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:48,250
-馬洛尼太太  我要和你談談  -他已經死了  埋葬了
- Mrs. Maloney, I have to talk to you.  - He's dead and buried.

1063
01:27:48,250 --> 01:27:50,390
-沒有什麼可談的  -他為什麼不想要我  
- There's nothing to talk about.  - Why didn't he want me...

1064
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:53,160
-尋找艾迪·休奎奇  -我不想聽你說話
- Iooking for Eddie Shoebridge?  - I am not listening to you.

1065
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:55,820
-離開我  -馬洛尼太太  你丈夫要殺我
- Get away from me!  - Mrs. Maloney, your husband tried to kill me,

1066
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:58,030
-你也有份  是嗎  -不
- and you were in on it, werert you?  - No.

1067
01:27:58,030 --> 01:28:01,930
-那為何總是逃避我  那就是原因  -不
- Then why are you always running away from me? Is that why?  - No.

1068
01:28:01,930 --> 01:28:05,670
你知道你是企圖謀殺的共犯嗎  
Do you realize that you are an accessory to an attempted murder?

1069
01:28:05,670 --> 01:28:10,110
-與我無關  -也許警方會認為你也有份
- I had nothing to do with that.  - Perhaps the police would think that you did.

1070
01:28:10,110 --> 01:28:13,940
-你要我去跟警察說嗎  -看在老天的份上
- You want me to go to the police about it?  - For God's sake.

1071
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:18,910
-你不會那樣  -告訴我艾迪·休奎奇在哪兒  
- You wouldn't do that...  - Just tell me where is Eddie Shoebridge?

1072
01:28:18,910 --> 01:28:23,820
-我不能  -馬洛尼太太  他在哪  請告訴我
- I can't.  - Mrs. Maloney, where is he? Please tell me.

1073
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:29,830
沒有艾迪·休奎奇
There is no Eddie Shoebridge.

1074
01:28:29,830 --> 01:28:34,960
他如煙霧般25年前來到這都市
He went up in smoke 25 years ago and came down in the city.

1075
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:39,300
他自稱亞瑟·亞當森
He calls himself Arthur Adamson.

1076
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:41,740
亞瑟·亞當森  
Arthur Adamson?

1077
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:46,980
如果他發現我告訴了你  他會殺了我
If he finds out I told you, he'll kill me.

1078
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:51,670
走開吧  別再靠近我了
Now go away, and don't ever come near me again.

1079
01:28:54,850 --> 01:28:58,580
騙子  騙子
Fake! Fake!

1080
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:14,770
等等  你這是在誇大
Wait a second, now. You're the one that's exaggerating.

1081
01:29:14,770 --> 01:29:18,510
不  不  我是失蹤了兩三天  但不可能更多了
No, I'll give you two or three days maybe I missed, but never more than that.

1082
01:29:18,510 --> 01:29:21,880
-告訴他這非常重要  -噓
- Tell him it's deeply important.  - Shh!

1083
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:24,480
-硬起來  -為何是我  
- Stand up.  - Why me?

1084
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,650
是什麼使你認為是我跑超過里程  
What makes you think that it's me that ran up all the extra mileage?

1085
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:32,950
那些傢伙如何  賀比或艾爾  值日班的人
What about that little asshole, Herbie, or, uh, Al, the one on the day shift?

1086
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:36,560
我明白了  我會去的
I understand. I'll be there.

1087
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:39,080
是  我保證我會過去
Yes, I promise I'll be there.

1088
01:29:42,530 --> 01:29:44,570
答案是不行
The answer's no.

1089
01:29:44,570 --> 01:29:48,140
他說我必須輪班  並且我今晚就要上工
He says I must work the shift, and I must work it tonight.

1090
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:50,440
幫我個忙  布蘭琪
And do me a favor, Blanche.

1091
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:52,870
拜託別再給我製造麻煩
Please don't give me a hard time.

1092
01:29:52,870 --> 01:29:54,980
你沒有全力去抗爭
You didn't put up much of a fight.

1093
01:29:54,980 --> 01:29:58,780
親愛的  聽著  我一直消磨時間在幫你
Honey, look. After all the goofir off I've been doir on your behalf,

1094
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:02,180
我差點就要失去我的駕駛座  
I'm within a gnat's eyelash of losir my cab

1095
01:30:02,190 --> 01:30:03,650
被踢出公司了
and gettir kicked right out of the company.

1096
01:30:03,650 --> 01:30:06,490
魯尼  你真傻  你不需要開計程車
Lumley, you're thick! You won't have to drive a cab...

1097
01:30:06,490 --> 01:30:09,560
如果你能把這件事辦好  就能拿到錢啊
if you can get this thing over and done with and collect the money.

1098
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,960
"如果"親愛的  你總是對我說如果
"If," darling. You're always givir me ifs.

1099
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:13,960
我不能靠如果吃飯  你也不能
I can't eat ifs and neither can you,

1100
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:17,130
朱莉亞·蘭伯特和你之間的  華爾滋太過遙遠了
while Julia Rainbird and you are waltzir around in the great beyond.

1101
01:30:17,130 --> 01:30:20,370
拜託  親愛的  我該做的就是回去工作
Come on, sweetheart. The least I can do is show up for work every now and then.

1102
01:30:20,370 --> 01:30:22,640
至少  我不是已經給你  那傢伙的名字了嗎  
After all, didn't I give you the guy's name?

1103
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,940
但是電話簿裡滿滿的都是  亞瑟·亞當森
But the phone book is full of Arthur Adamsons.

1104
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:28,840
這很簡單  你要做的  就是找出正確的那一個
It's very simple. All you need to do is find out the right one.

1105
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,810
那很容易  一個大約40歲
That's a snap. The one that's close to 40 years old...

1106
01:30:31,810 --> 01:30:33,920
聽到艾迪·休奎奇這名字  就會顫抖的傢伙
and trembles a little bit at the name Eddie Shoebridge.

1107
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:36,990
-簡單  我們明天來做  -現在做會更好
- Easy. We do that tomorrow.  - Now would be much better.

1108
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:40,090
食物就要到手了  魯尼  拜託你  親愛的
A bird in the hand, Lumley. Please. Oh, sweetheart.

1109
01:30:40,090 --> 01:30:42,290
唯一的食物是在我的手上
The only bird that's gonna be in my hand...

1110
01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:44,360
我必須遺憾地說
and I'm very sorry to say this...

1111
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:47,160
四點至午夜我必須開車
is a steering wheel from 4:00 to midnight.

1112
01:30:48,230 --> 01:30:51,200
好吧  我何時才能得到一個吻  
Sure. Why should I get a kiss?

1113
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:53,800
當我開始認為  你不再難以忍受的時候
Just when I was beginning to think you werert impossible.

1114
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,800
也許沒有你我也能做到
Maybe I'll do it without you.

1115
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,940
絕不可能
The hell you will!

1116
01:30:57,940 --> 01:30:59,940
來吧  布蘭琪  拜託
Come on, now. Please.

1117
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:03,140
這個休奎奇惹了許多麻煩  不想被發現
This Shoebridge fellow's gone to a lot of trouble not to be found.

1118
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:06,510
如今你不知道會被捲入  什麼麻煩當中
Now you got no idea what kind of trouble you could get into.

1119
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:09,080
不管是什麼  他會忘了那些事的
Whatever it is, he'll forget about it...

1120
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:11,550
當他聽到他將獲得數百萬時
when he hears about the millions he's coming into.

1121
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:13,760
噢  布蘭琪  拜託
Oh, Blanche, come on.

1122
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:18,160
坐下吧  你漂亮的小  屁股
Just sit down on your pretty little... behind.

1123
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:20,560
我得說  這很  
And I must say, it is quite an...

1124
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:23,100
不  這是很吸引人的小屁股
No, it is. Very attractive little behind.

1125
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:25,270
等我  好嗎  
Just wait for me, okay?

1126
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:29,970
今晚我回到家  我們會  
And tonight when I get home, we will, uh...

1127
01:31:29,970 --> 01:31:33,510
很好  好好地商量我們的策略
Right. Very nice. Plot our strategy.

1128
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:36,070
明白我的意思嗎  親愛的
Know what I mean, darlir?

1129
01:31:50,990 --> 01:31:53,430
誰需要他
Who needs him.

1130
01:32:03,870 --> 01:32:07,010
你不會是亞瑟·亞當森  對吧  
You wouldn't be Arthur Adamson, would you?

1131
01:32:07,010 --> 01:32:09,440
抱歉
Excuse me.

1132
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:16,850
抱歉
Excuse me!

1133
01:32:19,190 --> 01:32:22,220
哈羅  你是亞瑟·亞當森  
Hello. Are you Arthur Adamson?

1134
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:24,660
嘿  亞瑟
Hey, Art!

1135
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:28,430
什麼事  
Yeah?

1136
01:32:53,190 --> 01:32:55,190
對不起  我們打烊了
I'm sorry. We're just closing.

1137
01:32:55,190 --> 01:32:59,660
我知道  我不是要購物  請問亞當森先生在嗎  
I understand. I'm not shopping. Is Mr. Adamson around?

1138
01:32:59,660 --> 01:33:04,430
-不  他不在  但你可以明天再來  -好的
- I'm afraid not. But if you come back tomorrow...  - All right.

1139
01:33:04,430 --> 01:33:07,040
但是為了確認是我要找的  亞當森先生
But just to be sure I have the right Mr. Adamson,

1140
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:11,670
-我猜他是一位年約40歲的紳士  -是的  沒錯
- he is a gentleman of about 40, I trust?  - Yes, that's about right.

1141
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:14,840
噢  整個下午以來  這是第一個令人鼓舞的消息
Oh, that's the first encouraging news I've had all afternoon.

1142
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:17,710
為了不耽誤時間  我到哪裡能找到他  
Isn't there someplace I might reach him without delay?

1143
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:19,710
-你是說今晚  -是的
- You mean tonight?  - Yes.

1144
01:33:19,710 --> 01:33:23,020
他平常都會直接從這裡回家
Well, he usually goes directly home from here.

1145
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:26,550
但今晚很不幸  因為我想他今天要開個派對
But tonight would be very bad because I believe he's giving a party.

1146
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:29,790
我知道他今天提早離開  是為了這個原因
I know he left unusually early for some such reason.

1147
01:33:29,790 --> 01:33:32,490
是不是有什麼我可以幫你轉達的  在明天早上  
Isn't there something I can tell him for you in the morning?

1148
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:36,130
-這是私人事情  相當私人  -喔  我明白了
- This is personal. Rather personal.  - Oh, I see.

1149
01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:39,530
或是你想留個字條給他
Perhaps you'd like to leave him a note.

1150
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:42,200
-字條  是的  -好的  請這邊走
- A note? Very good.  - Yes. Come this way.

1151
01:33:43,770 --> 01:33:46,210
抱歉
Excuse me.

1152
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:50,480
謝謝
Thank you.

1153
01:34:03,290 --> 01:34:05,730
有什麼問題嗎  
Is anything the matter?

1154
01:34:05,730 --> 01:34:08,330
嗯  我只是在想  
Uh, I was, uh, just thinking.

1155
01:34:08,330 --> 01:34:11,200
與其留字條在這裡
Instead of leaving this note here,

1156
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:15,440
不如這樣會更好  我今晚  就發個電報給亞當森先生
it might be better if I sent Mr. Adamson a telegram tonight.

1157
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:18,670
-能告訴我他的地址嗎  -呃  我不能  
- What's his address, please?  - Well, I don't...

1158
01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:22,110
沒關係的  我們是朋友
It's all right. We're friends.

1159
01:34:22,110 --> 01:34:24,680
-富蘭克林街1001號  -富蘭克林街1001號
- 1001 Franklin Street.  - 1001 Franklin.

1160

非常感謝你  你真是親切
Thank you very much. You've been very kind.

1161
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:32,690
你是摩羯座的嗎  
You're a Capricorn, aren't you?

1162
01:34:32,690 --> 01:34:35,120
不  我是獅子座
No, I'm a Leo.

1163
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:39,450
我想也是
That's what I thought.

1164
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:56,440
-皮特  嗨  -哈羅  布蘭琪寶貝
- Pete, hi.  - Hello, there, Blanche, baby.

1165
01:34:56,440 --> 01:35:00,380
-你有看到喬治嗎  -他幾分鐘前剛離開  很快會回來
- Have you seen George?  - He just left a few minutes ago, but he'll be back.

1166
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:02,850
送四個人到河谷參加派對
Took a party of four out to River Valley.

1167
01:35:02,850 --> 01:35:04,730
喔  親愛的  那可能要通宵  
Oh, dear. That could take all night.

1168
01:35:04,730 --> 01:35:05,950
放輕鬆  有什麼事嗎
Easily. What's up?

1169
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:08,290
-你能幫我傳個話給他嗎  -當然可以
- Would you give him a message for me?  - Sure thing.

1170
01:35:08,290 --> 01:35:10,930
-告訴他說我找到他了  -你找到他  
- Just tell him I found him.  - You found him?

1171
01:35:10,930 --> 01:35:13,700
沒錯  他住在富蘭克林1001號  
That's right. He lives at 1001 Franklin.

1172
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:15,160
富蘭克林1001號
1001 Franklin.

1173
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:17,700
那就是他的住所  而我現在就要過去
That's where he lives, and that's where I'm going now.

1174
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:20,440
你找到他了  那就是他的住所  並且你現在就要過去
You found him, and that's where he lives, and that's where you're going now.

1175
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:22,930
-謝謝  皮特  -隨時候勞  布蘭琪
- Thanks, Pete.  - Any time, Blanche.

1176
01:35:32,350 --> 01:35:35,150
你要去踩點了  
You wanna go over the new pickup spot once again?

1177
01:35:35,150 --> 01:35:37,420
我記在心裡
I know it by heart.

1178
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:40,820
你沒問題吧  
Are you all right?

1179
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:43,760
-我沒問題  -你確定  
- I will be.  - You sure?

必須在9:30前到達  我們走吧
Have to be there at 9:30. Let's get going.

1181
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:31,040
伍德主教  該走了
Bishop Wood, it's time to go.

1182
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:33,270
你有穿上你的法衣嗎  
Have you your vestments on?

1183
01:36:33,270 --> 01:36:36,740
是的  但我還沒吃完雞
Yes, but I haven't finished the chicken.

1184
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:41,550
對不起  閣下
I'm sorry, Your Excellency.

1185
01:36:41,550 --> 01:36:43,750
我要你照以下說的做
Here's what I want you to do.

1186
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:46,090
請把椅子放在房間中央
Place the armchair in the center of the room...

1187
01:36:46,090 --> 01:36:50,190
背對著門  坐在椅子上
facing away from the door and seat yourself in it.

1188
01:36:50,190 --> 01:36:53,800
你會睡得很安穩
You're going to be comfortably put to sleep.

1189
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:57,200
只是一小段時間
But it'll last only for a short while.

1190
01:36:57,200 --> 01:37:02,000
非常感謝你  你想得真周到
Thank you very much. You are most considerate.

1191
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,910
當你準備好後  讓我知道
Let me know when you're ready.

1192
01:37:04,910 --> 01:37:08,040
順便說一下  我還沒看完那本書
By the way. I haven't quite finished that book...

1193
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:10,410
你讓我看書真好
you were kind enough to let me have.

1194
01:37:10,410 --> 01:37:13,240
我想  能讓我帶走嗎  
May I, uh, take it along?

1195
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:18,390
好帶走我們的指紋  
With our fingerprints on it? Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1196
01:37:18,390 --> 01:37:21,560
不錯的嘗試  閣下
Nice try, Your Excellency.

1197
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:26,760
謝謝  不煩你了  我準備好了
Thank you. Don't bother, then. I'm ready.

1198
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:29,660
好的  我會把你的燈熄滅
All right, I'll be turning your light off now.

1199
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:58,950
我們不能遲到  看看是誰  小心點
We mustrt be late. See who it is, and be careful.

1200
01:38:29,420 --> 01:38:32,660
是她  那個女人  布蘭琪·泰勒
It's her. That woman. Blanche Tyler.

1201
01:38:32,660 --> 01:38:36,100
簡直難以置信
This is incredible!

1202
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:39,690
-計程車司機和她在一起  -只有她
- Is that cab driver with her?  - She's alone.

1203
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:44,640
如果我不是要在35分鐘內辦事  
If I didn't have to make this pickup in 35 minutes...

1204
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:47,240
我們應該怎麼做  
What are we going to do?

1205
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:49,610
什麼也別做
Nothing!

1206
01:38:49,610 --> 01:38:52,010
等一會兒
Until later tonight.

1207
01:39:04,290 --> 01:39:07,130
-她不見了  -快點  走吧
- She's gone.  - Come on. Let's go.

1208
01:39:07,130 --> 01:39:09,560
快  快  快
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

1209
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:28,610
-我想你說過  -我知道
- I thought you said...  - I know.

1210
01:40:28,610 --> 01:40:32,080
-亞當森先生  -看著他
- Mr. Adamson?  - Watch him.

1211
01:40:38,150 --> 01:40:42,220
喔  亞當森先生  真幸運  我沒有錯過你
Oh, Mr. Adamson. How lucky I am not to have missed you.

1212
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:45,230
-顯然你沒有聽到我在前門按鈴  -顯然是
- Apparently you didn't hear me at the front door.  - Apparently.

1213
01:40:45,230 --> 01:40:49,100
我叫布蘭琪·泰勒  是個通靈師
I am Madame Blanche Tyler, the spiritualist.

1214
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:51,430
晚安  甜心
Good evening, honey.

1215
01:40:51,430 --> 01:40:53,490
布蘭琪女士  我能麻煩你  
Madame Blanche, I wonder if I might suggest to you to remove

1216
01:40:53,490 --> 01:40:55,270
把你的車移開我們的車道嗎
your car from our driveway.

1217
01:40:55,270 --> 01:40:58,240
-我們約會快遲到了  -喔  是的
- We're terribly late for an appointment.  - Well, yes.

1218
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:02,780
當你聽到我來的原因  亞當森先生  或者該稱呼休奎奇  
When you hear why I've come, Mr. Adamson... Or should I say Shoebridge?

1219
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:05,050
-你就不會介意遲到了  -我親愛的女士
- You won't mind being late at all.  - My dear lady,

1220
01:41:05,050 --> 01:41:07,240
-我很清楚你來的原因  -你怎麼知道的  
- I know exactly why you've come here.  - How could you?

1221
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:10,850
-你和你的朋友  那個計程車司機  -你認識喬治  
- And exactly why you and your friend, that cab driver...  - You know George?

1222
01:41:10,850 --> 01:41:16,020
過去幾個星期以來一直在追查我  就好像兩條嗜血的獵犬
Have been sniffing along my trail like two eager bloodhounds these past few weeks.

1223
01:41:16,020 --> 01:41:18,330
我沒有這樣想  亞當森先生
I had no idea, Mr. Adamson.

1224
01:41:18,330 --> 01:41:21,560
-好吧  布蘭琪女士  你找到我了  -真是好極了
- All right, Madame Blanche, you found me.  - Music to my ears.

1225
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:24,040
我非常願意聽取你的要求  
I'm perfectly willing to listen to your demands,

1226
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:26,330
不論是什麼  但不是現在
whatever they might be, but not right now.

1227
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:29,400
沒有要求  亞當森先生  噢  不  不  不
No demands, Mr. Adamson. Oh, no, no, no!

1228
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:33,310
是幾乎沒有  朱莉亞·蘭伯特  不會向你要求什麼  
Hardly that. Julia Rainbird wants nothing from you...

1229
01:41:33,310 --> 01:41:38,050
但是你必須做她的繼承人  繼承所有蘭伯特家的財富
but the privilege of making you heir to the entire Rainbird fortune.

1230
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:40,280
所有的  動人的數百萬美元
The whole, lovely millions and millions of it.

1231
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:44,890
如果她有提出任何要求  那就是要我找到你
Now if she made any demands at all, they were on me to find you.

1232
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:47,920
透過通靈的手段  那是當然的
Through psychic means, of course.

1233
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:49,500
讓我搞清楚一下  
Let me get this straight.

1234
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:52,860
這就是你和  你的朋友一直追查我的原因
Is that the only reason you and your friend have been, shall we say, investigating me?

1235
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:55,530
喔  是的  不要以為這很容易
Oh, yes. And don't think it's been easy.

1236
01:41:55,530 --> 01:41:58,970
噢  亞當森先生  你給了我和喬治魔鬼般的考驗
Oh, Mr. Adamson, you've given George and me the devil's own time of it.

1237
01:41:58,970 --> 01:42:01,570
追蹤打從你嬰兒時期被遺棄開始
Tracing you from a foundling baby...

1238
01:42:01,570 --> 01:42:06,010
一直到叫做休奎奇的青年  然後是叫做亞當森的男士
to a young boy named Shoebridge to a man named Adamson.

1239
01:42:06,010 --> 01:42:08,880
噢  但是  亞當森先生  你就在這裡  我也在這裡
Oh, but, Mr. Adamson, here you are, : Here I am.

1240
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:12,550
這對我們來說  真是快樂的時刻  不是嗎  
It's a happy moment for us all, isn't it?

1241
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:15,480
是主教
It's the Bishop.

1242
01:42:26,290 --> 01:42:29,190
有誰知道你來這裡  
Does anyone know that you've come here?

1243
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:32,770
沒有人知道  
No one know...

1244
01:42:32,770 --> 01:42:35,640
有誰會知道  
Anyone kn-know?

1245
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:39,310
不  連靈魂也沒有
No. Not a soul.

1246
01:42:39,310 --> 01:42:42,780
即使是喬治的靈魂
Not even George soul.

1247
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:46,510
你沒有什麼好擔心的  亞當森先生
You have nothing to worry about, Mr. Adamson.

1248
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:50,150
我保證
I promise.

1249
01:42:52,350 --> 01:42:56,520
我不會吐露半個字  給任何人
I won't breathe a word... to anyone.

1250
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:18,740
看來布蘭琪·泰勒女士  需要休息一下
It looks like Miss Tyler needs some rest.

1251
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:26,620
你不聽我的話  
Will you do as I say?

1252
01:43:43,170 --> 01:43:47,400
不  不
No. No.

1253
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:31,520
打開門
Unlock the door.

1254
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,960
高興一點  法蘭
Cheer up, Fran.

1255
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:44,290
讓我們去取新的鑽石  來裝飾我們的吊燈吧
Let's go get the new diamond for our chandelier.

1256
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:12,120
哇  真是漂亮
Wow. It's gorgeous.

1257
01:45:22,170 --> 01:45:25,140
現在輪到布蘭琪女士了
And now for Madame Blanche.

1258
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:48,450
噢  我的天
Oh, my God.

1259
01:51:32,310 --> 01:51:34,740
布蘭琪  
Blanche?

1260
01:51:45,690 --> 01:51:48,120
布蘭琪  
Blanche?

1261
01:51:55,130 --> 01:51:57,560
布蘭琪  
Blanche?

1262
01:52:26,860 --> 01:52:31,030
如果我說得太多  也許是因為你不說話
If I'm talking too much, perhaps it's because you're not talking.

1263
01:52:31,030 --> 01:52:34,330
我胃痛  亞瑟  它不同意謀殺
It's my stomach, Arthur. Murder doesn't agree with it.

1264
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:36,970
你以為我很期待  
You think I'm looking forward to it?

1265
01:52:36,970 --> 01:52:40,800
如果喬森·馬洛尼能幹一點  他們現在早就都死了
If Joe Maloney had been more efficient, they'd both be dead by now.

1266
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:44,340
你可以拿走我的那一份  亞瑟
You can have my share, Arthur.

1267
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:49,210
你可以把兩顆鑽石都佔為己有  只要你能結束一切
You can keep both diamonds all to yourself if you'll just end it.

1268
01:52:49,850 --> 01:52:52,650
我會告訴你該怎麼做
I'll tell you what I'll do.

1269
01:52:52,650 --> 01:52:55,820
如果你幫我把這個睡美人  從地窖搬到我們的車上
If you help me carry Sleeping Beauty up out of the cellar, load her into our car...

1270
01:52:55,820 --> 01:53:00,060
開車送她去荒蕪的公路  那些可以自殺的地方
and drive her out to some deserted road where a suicide can take place,

1271
01:53:00,060 --> 01:53:02,890
我向你保證  我們可以來討論這件事
I promise you we'll talk this thing over.

1272
01:53:03,630 --> 01:53:06,700
-好嗎  -計程車司機怎麼辦  
- Okay?  - What about the cab driver?

1273
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:11,070
如果她能找到我們  我相信他也可以
If she was able to find us, I'm sure he can too.

1274
01:53:11,070 --> 01:53:15,840
-他逃不出我們的手掌心  -是你的手  不是我的
- He'll walk right into our hands.  - Your hands, not mine.

1275
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:18,350
你不覺得我們  應該下去看一看她嗎  
Don't you think we ought to go down and take a look at her?

1276
01:53:18,350 --> 01:53:20,510
自從我們給她注射以來  已經有一段時間了
It's been a while since we gave her that shot.

1277
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:24,280
-你去  -好吧
- You do it.  - Okay.

1278
01:54:37,690 --> 01:54:40,960
你會很高興知道她仍然昏迷著
You'll be happy to know she's still unconscious.

1279
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:06,080
-布蘭琪  -噓
- Blanche.  - Shh!

1280
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:34,480
我會這樣結束  把管子的一端  
I'll put this end into her exhaust pipe...

1281
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:37,620
接到排氣管  另一端放在車窗中
and the other end in the window.

1282
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:40,780
這樣看來就像是自殺
That way, it'll look like suicide.

1283
01:56:15,020 --> 01:56:17,260
最好現在就去把她帶過來
Better go and get her now.

1284
01:56:17,260 --> 01:56:20,780
我要把她放在我們車裡  你開她的
I'll take her in our car. You follow in hers.

1285
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:36,070
你抓住她的雙腳
You take hold of her feet.

1286
01:56:40,550 --> 01:56:43,950
老天  她還真重
Jesus, she's heavy.

1287
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:47,550
喬治
George!

1288
01:56:48,620 --> 01:56:51,390
抓到他們了
Got 'em.

1289
01:56:54,390 --> 01:56:56,900
布蘭琪  你演的太好了
Blanche, you faked that one beautifully.

1290
01:56:56,900 --> 01:56:59,870
你仍然是冠軍
You are still the champ.

1291
01:56:59,870 --> 01:57:02,440
謝謝  喬治
Thank you, George.

1292
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:06,060
你知道這兩個的賞金值多少嗎  
Do you realize how much the reward is for those two?

1293
01:57:07,510 --> 01:57:09,540
是的
Yes.

1294
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:12,230
但是你知道  如果我們能夠
But do you realize how much more the reward would be...

1295
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:16,190
找到鑽石  還會有多少獎勵嗎  
if we could find the diamonds and turn 'em in?

1296
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:25,290
你怎麼了  
What's the matter with you?

1297
01:57:25,290 --> 01:57:27,460
我  
I...

1298
01:57:27,460 --> 01:57:29,890
布蘭琪  怎麼回事  
Blanche, what's the matter?

1299
01:57:40,610 --> 01:57:43,080
布蘭琪  怎麼回事  
Blanche, what's the matter?

1300
01:57:56,590 --> 01:57:59,020
怎麼了  
What is it?

1301
01:58:29,060 --> 01:58:31,590
布蘭琪  你辦到了
Blanche, you did it!

1302
01:58:31,590 --> 01:58:34,030
你真是個通靈師
You are psychic!

1303
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:38,730
-我們在樓梯上幹嘛  -你不再是假的
- What am I doing here on the stairs?  - You're not a fake.

1304
01:58:38,730 --> 01:58:41,430
你真的找到了一個  瞧
You actually found one. Look.

1305
01:58:41,430 --> 01:58:43,440
我找到的  
I did?

1306
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:46,410
我要打電話給警察  告訴他們好消息
I'll get the police on the phone and give them our good news,

1307
01:58:46,410 --> 01:58:50,070
還要通知蘭伯特女士  告訴她壞消息
and call Miss Rainbird and give her the bad.

1308
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:59,820
接線生  能幫我接通警察局嗎  
Operator, can I have the police?
