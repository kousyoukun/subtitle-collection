1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Family Plot

2
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,810
Someone is here.

3
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,510
Not closely.

4
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,480
Not willingly.

5
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,220
I feel a holding back.

6
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,690
What's the trouble, Henry?

7
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,760
Too many memories, too much pain.

8
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,250
Too... much... sorrow.

9
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,870
Whoever is there with you,

10
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,640
tell them to speak up, Henry.

11
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,810
Tell them to come closer.

12
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,650
I think I know who it is, Madame Blanche.

13
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,680
I think I know what's bothering her.

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,520
Her, is it? Never you mind, Miss Rainbird.

15
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,320
I won't have you doing Henry's work for him.

16
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,960
Now, let's have it, my love. That's why we're here tonight.

17
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,900
To help my friend be rid of her torment.

18
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,690
She has a right to rest her weary head

19
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,820
on a pillow each night...

20
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,840
and sleep the peaceful sleep of the angels.

21
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,080
How did you know about my troubled sleep?

22
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,890
Who told you?

23
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,100
Her nights cannot go on like this much longer.

24
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,850
I never told a soul about my nightmares.

25
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,220
- How could you...  - Who is this person who arrives...

26
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,160
in our presence tonight, but does not dare to come close to us?

27
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,070
It's her. It's my sister Harriet.

28
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:22,500
- It must be.  - She stays her distance,

29
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,240
Julia Rainbird, for she does not feel...

30
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,480
your love or your kindness yet.

31
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,780
There is selfishness where you are.

32
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,750
I've had all I can take from her.

33
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,150
Night after night, coming into my dreams.

34
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,420
Whining, complaining, trying to make me feel guilty,

35
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,630
as though I need her to tell me right from wrong.

36
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,700
Tell her I know what has to be done.

37
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,230
I've been wanting to do it for a year.

38
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:58,100
But it is I, Julia Rainbird, who has made the decision.

39
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,110
I don't need her to goad me on!

40
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:07,180
They're making me ill with their ugly words in my ugly dreams.

41
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,950
Tell her to stop it, to go away and leave me alone.

42
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,990
Oh, no. No, no. Don't let her go!

43
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,560
- Don't let her go away.  - Harriet?

44
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,730
Harriet, stay with us, Harriet.

45
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,710
Your sister wants to speak to you now,

46
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,910
from the depths of her soul.

47
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,570
What's wrong? What is it?

48
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,680
She says, "I've waited so long...

49
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,810
"to hear from you, Julia.

50
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,440
I've been so unhappy without you."

51
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,990
It is you, Harriet.

52
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,220
Oh, I'm so sorry!

53
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,230
I-I should never have made you do it.

54
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,230
Oh, it's all past now.

55
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,670
But I'll do what I can to make up for it.

56
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,000
If he's still alive, I'll find your son.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,040
And I'll take him in my arms and love him...

58
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,040
as if I were you, my poor Harriet.

59
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,780
And I'll... I'll make him one of us.

60
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,120
And give him everything. Everything!

61
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,190
Far away.

62
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,490
So far, far away.

63
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,390
Bu-But I need her. I need her help.

64
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,060
I can't do it alone.

65
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,100
You see, I need her memory.

66
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,740
It's over 40 years ago, and I don't know where the child was taken...

67
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,740
or who it was given to.

68
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,310
I don't know where he is now or who he is.

69
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,580
The true measure of Julia Rainbird's love...

70
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,580
lies in what she does now,

71
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,180
with your help, of course, and mine,

72
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,320
and that of the dear, departed one...

73
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,820
who has drifted so far from us.

74
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,830
We understand him. Don't we, Miss Rainbird?

75
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:05,070
Oh, yes. Yes, I do. I'm willing to do anything. Anything at all.

76
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,100
In the end, there will be happiness.

77
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,680
From the tears of the past, the desert of the heart will bloom.

78
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,110
Good-bye, Julia Rainbird! Good-bye, Blanche.

79
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,650
Good-bye.

80
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,330
Madame Blanche! Are you all right?

81
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,800
Oh. It was...

82
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
What in the world's been going on here?

83
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,130
I feel as though I've been properly done over.

84
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,510
Don't you remember what happened? Mm-mm.

85
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,740
Not the details, Miss Rainbird, only the gist, if you know what I mean.

86
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,210
Suppose you give me the gist of it.

87
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,580
Oh well, I wonder...

88
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,920
Could I trouble you for a sip of something? Ju-Just...

89
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,920
Oh, of course. What would you like?

90
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,190
Oh, a double shot of anyth...

91
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,350
- A spot of that sherry might be nice.  - Oh, yes. Of course.

92
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,000
Thank you.

93
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,780
- Now, tell me what you remember of the seance.  - In a nutshell?

94
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,810
Please.

95
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,120
Well...

96
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,250
About 40 years ago, you arranged to have...

97
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,860
your sister Harriet's baby given away without a trace.

98
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,020
And now your bad dreams and troubled conscience tell you...

99
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,730
to find the grown-up person, take him into the family...

100
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,730
and bestow your wealth on him.

101
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,400
- Excellent.  - Thank you.

102
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,070
And why did I force my sister to give the child away?

103
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:53,230
I guess the kid was a... illegitimate, Miss Rainbird.

104
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,180
I don't want you to think me a puritan, Madame Blanche.

105
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,980
But 40 years ago, an unmarried mother...

106
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,580
was not the commonplace it is nowadays.

107
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,620
And in a family like ours,

108
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,560
a scandal had to be covered up at all costs.

109
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,860
I understand.

110
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,960
And I'm still sufficiently old-fashioned,

111
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,960
and sufficiently protective of the Rainbird name,

112
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,970
to want to seek the missing heir...

113
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,140
in a private and secret fashion,

114
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,170
rather than go to detective agencies...

115
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,310
and put notices in the newspapers.

116
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,470
A most wise decision, Miss Rainbird.

117
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,620
Well, now, suppose we get to the reason...for my sending for you.

118
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,290
I'm 78 years of age.

119
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,720
I would like to go to my grave with a quiet conscience.

120
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,260
Particularly as I know that my only heir is out there somewhere,

121
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,300
deprived by my acts of his true Rainbird name.

122
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,130
Will you help me with your powers?

123
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,940
If in your heart you believe that I can,

124
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,880
then I owe it to both of us to try, Miss Rainbird.

125
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,950
No, I'm too old for trying.

126
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,010
I've only time enough left for results!

127
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,960
Find him for me, Madame Blanche.

128
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
Use your spirit-control, your "Henry."g

129
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,860
Get through to my sister.

130
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,990
Find her son, whoever he is, wherever he is,

131
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,500
and I'll pay you $10,000.

132
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,490
Te...

133
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,170
Only if you genuinely wish to, Miss Rainbird.

134
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:36,240
But let's not think of this as a payment to me.

135
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,680
There are many causes dear to my heart,

136
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,150
which need all the charity the world can spare.

137
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,450
You've no idea how refreshing it is for a woman of my wealth...

138
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,320
to find someone who has so little use for money.

139
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,420
Thank you.

140
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,200
Well, now, I regard our arrangement as completed.

141
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,170
I... It's my bedtime.

142
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,840
I must take leave of your delightful company.

143
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,870
This has been a most memorable evening for me, Miss Rainbird.

144
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,840
See to it that you make it a rewarding one.

145
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,510
At the risk of repeating myself,

146
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,510
I hope you will not forget...

147
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,020
that nobody, absolutely no one, should know of our search.

148
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,290
The Rainbird name must be protected.

149
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,620
My jaw is locked.

150
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,250
On that note, I will say good-bye, and thank you for coming.

151
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,990
So, how'd it go?

152
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,270
I don't know. Having to do Henry is murder on my throat.

153
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:11,270
- Murder.  - Yeah, yeah. I know.

154
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,610
- So how did it go?  - She's hooked, waiting to be pulled in.

155
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,450
Another one of your $25 sardines?

156
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,580
No. This is a big one, George. A great big whale.

157
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,820
Well, come on. Give.

158
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,920
Keep your eyes on the road. Don't rush me.

159
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,490
Okay, Blanchie.

160
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,930
Start way up at the top.

161
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,960
Well, it was as simple as A-B-C. Henry came to me from the Upper Brightness,

162
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,500
whispered to me, "This womars been having sleep problems."

163
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,170
From there on, things followed naturally, logically.

164
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,470
Aha! So I came through for you again, didn't I, darlin?

165
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,740
No. What are you talking about, George?

166
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,940
What do you mean, what am I talking about?

167
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,850
You know damn well what I'm talking about.

168
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,620
All that information that I dug up by gabbir to the local druggist...

169
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,620
about how she was drivir him crazy...

170
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,620
tryir to get sleeping pills without a prescription!

171
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,160
That could have been very, very useful to me.

172
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,160
Why didn't you tell me about that?

173
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,930
What do you mean, why didn't I tell you? I told you. You know damn well I told you.

174
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,700
No, you always think you tell me things, and you forget to.

175
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,900
I have to go through heaven and hell, the Great Beyond, with Henry.

176
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,240
Henry, my ass. It was me.

177
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,510
It's always me.

178
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,810
Without my research, you're about as psychic as a dry salami.

179
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,350
Nasty. Nasty, nasty.

180
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,220
I'm sick and tired of having you hang me by the crystal balls.

181
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,190
Leave your crystal balls out of this, George.

182
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,790
No, let's leave Henry out of this and keep the bullshit for your customers.

183
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,860
You're jealous of him, aren't you?

184
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,900
Oh, please, Blanche.

185
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,370
I like your jealousy. It's your driving that stinks.

186
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,570
Hey, look. I happen to be an actor, not a cab driver.

187
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,840
I can play cab drivers, but I sure as hell don't have to drive like one.

188
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,180
Well, until I can collect from Julia Rainbird,

189
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,880
I'm afraid you're gonna have to go on playing a cab driver.

190
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,980
Neither of us seems to be very fond of starving to death.

191
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,650
Well, how are we supposed to collect? How much is this Rainbird whale gonna spout up?

192
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,820
Also, you're gonna have to go on playing a private eye.

193
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,320
Christ, no! I've had it playing private eyes.

194
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,860
Christ, yes! Now, George.

195
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,100
Stop blaspheming.

196
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,620
You wanna put the curse on ten big ones?

197
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,240
Now, wait a minute, Blanche.

198
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,070
- Did you say ten big ones?  - Mm-hmm.

199
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,070
- Ten thousand?  - Mm-hmm.

200
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,600
- Dollars?  - Dollars, George!

201
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,210
Now, Blanche, you got any idea...

202
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,220
what you and I could do with ten grand?

203
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,350
Mm-hmm. We could even get married.

204
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,290
What are you always a wet blanket for?

205
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,890
Oh, you flatter me so.

206
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,890
Well, what's the deal? What do we have to do?

207
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,260
I'll tell you about it in bed, afterwards.

208
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,870
Aw, come on, Blanche. Give me a hint.

209
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,700
Just a little... Fore play.

210
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,700
All right. Find one man. That's all.

211
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,810
Well, we've had to do worse than that. What's his name?

212
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:04,280
Hmm. Ah... nobody knows.

213
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,720
- Well, who is he?  - That's a problem. Nobody knows.

214
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,490
- Where is he?  - Nobody knows.

215
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,290
Well, for chrissake! You mean, nobody knows, Blanche?

216
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,720
Nobody knows his name, or where he is, or who he is?

217
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,860
Well, George, stop yelling.

218
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,700
There's a possibility of one person who might have known.

219
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,000
- Well, who's that?  - Julia Rainbird didn't mention him to me.

220
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,600
Fortunately, her friend Ida Cookson did.

221
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,440
- Well, who is it?  - The Rainbird family chauffeur.

222
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,780
Well, now you're talkir. Now we're on our way.

223
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,710
Trouble is... Well,

224
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,820
he's been dead for 25 years.

225
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,120
Oh, for chrissake, Blanche...

226
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,650
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, don't start to fret, George,

227
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,020
or our water bed will be no fun at all tonight.

228
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,260
As an actor, you should know fretting will ruin a performance.

229
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,930
You're not gonna have to worry about my performance tonight.

230
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:57,160
As a matter of fact, uh, on this very evening,

231
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,330
you're gonna see a standing ovation.

232
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,720
She's here. No, not a man. It's a woman.

233
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,240
Right. Follow me.

234
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,110
As long as you've got Victor Constantine, we can't touch you.

235
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,810
So you might as well put that thing away.

236
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,030
You've been calling yourself"The Trader," so we thought you were a man.

237
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,210
I think we deserve some assurance that the victim is still alive.

238
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,090
All radios have been removed from the helicopter, as you instructed.

239
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:16,790
"Mr. Constantine will be unconscious but in perfect condition when picked up. Just let him sleep the drug off."

240
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,010
All right, Sergeant, turn on the lights.

241
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,530
- Don't try and be a hero.  - Yes, sir.

242
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,210
Well, we've done our part.

243
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,110
Where are we going?

244
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,110
Not one goddamn mistake.

245
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,650
How far are we going?

246
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,020
It's lucky for you they've still got the victim.

247
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,190
I'd like nothing better than to toss you right out of this thing on your head.

248
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,040
You sure have this little trip mapped out, don't you?

249
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,310
I bet that thing isn't even loaded.

250
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,720
Golf course, huh?

251
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,960
Brilliant. Absolutely perfect.

252
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:02,560
My feet are killing me. These damn six-inch heels.

253
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,130
I happen to like tall women.

254
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,940
Everybody likes tall women.

255
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,870
In fact, everyone's going to be looking for a tall woman.

256
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,870
Aside from complaining a lot,

257
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,010
what have you been doing with yourself lately?

258
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,150
Oh, nothing much. Picking up a ransom, that sort of thing.

259
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,880
Did you see anyone, uh, we know?

260
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,550
Two men who look like police and a third who just had to be F.B.I.

261
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,220
You mix with the nicest people.

262
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,360
Beats housework.

263
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,260
- Did you say anything to them?  - Not a syllable.

264
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,500
Now, you see, honey?

265
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,860
I told you you could learn to keep your mouth shut, if you tried.

266
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,430
Look who's here.

267
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:54,950
Mm. Has anyone seen a tall, blonde woman around here lately?

268
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,950
Gone, poof! Who needs her?

269
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:02,050
I do. At least one more time.

270
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,530
Let me put that there, darlin.

271
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,010
Mr. Constantine has left us some wine.

272
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,750
I don't think he likes the imported stuff.

273
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,820
Uh... It was probably my veal parmesan.

274
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,320
- I'm afraid I overcooked it.  - He likes eating in a room with a view, that's all.

275
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,490
You know how fussy rich people are.

276
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,450
Don't forget to empty that out.

277
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,460
Don't you think emptying a chemical toilet... is below the dignity of a jewel collector?

278
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,660
- The wages of sin, Arthur.  - I'll do it tomorrow.

279
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,470
Never put off till tomorrow...

280
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:01,930
- what you can empty out tonight.  - Bitch.

281
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,440
Arthur, what's Amsterdam like?

282
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,450
Oh, lots of canals.

283
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,620
Lots of wizened old men...

284
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:46,250
with sharp eyes, sitting around cutting big stones into little ones.

285
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,690
You'll see.

286
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,890
I don't know what's come over me tonight. I'm tingling all over.

287
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,870
I told you about danger, didn't I?

288
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,370
First it makes you sick.

289
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:06,740
Then, when you get through it, it makes you very,

290
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,570
very loving.

291
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,150
- Darling, is it...  - Hmm?

292
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,710
It was all too easy. It's frightening.

293
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,990
Brilliant planning.

294
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,750
They don't have a single lead to follow.

295
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,330
What about the ketamine we stuck him with?

296
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:32,070
Well, if Doctor Vogel didn't miss it six months ago when I had my wisdom tooth out,

297
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,070
he's not gonna miss it now.

298
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,440
Don't finish up in there. Let's go to bed.

299
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,140
- Tired?  - Mm-mm. Tingling all over.

300
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,910
How'd I ever let you get me into all this?

301
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:48,080
I thought I fell in love with you because I needed some stability.

302
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,020
Well, I guess you're just a bad judge of character.

303
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,550
- Where'd you put the diamond, dear?  - Where everyone can see it.

304
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,820
- You didn't.  - I did.

305
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,460
- Are you gonna tell me where?  - You'll have to torture me first.

306
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,700
Oh! I intend to.

307
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,130
In a few minutes.

308
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,110
Now, with all due respect to the F.B.I. And the Bureau of Inspectors,

309
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,440
I have no time to play games.

310
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,310
Now, lest we forget, gentlemen, I have been away from this desk forcibly.

311
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,310
I've got a lot of work to catch up on.

312
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:25,270
Now, how many more times we gonna go through this goddamn thing?

313
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,660
Until we come up with something, Mr. Constantine.

314
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,820
That's a hell of a way to solve a kidnapping.

315
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:35,330
Mr. Constantine, you're not the first victim, you know. There have been others.

316
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:38,200
All right, all right. But from me, you'll learn absolutely nothing.

317
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,700
- You never know.  - I know.

318
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,900
All right. Floyd?

319
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,370
Now. The underground garage.

320
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:48,140
- Full of cars.  - Sounds?

321
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,380
- People, behind me.  - Was it a man, or was it a woman?

322
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,380
- I don't know.  - Man or woman?

323
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,710
- Man.  - Then what?

324
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,790
It was a prick in my shoulder. I started to turn.

325
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,350
Eh...And I woke up in a room.

326
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:05,860
Yes, and what did you hear? Inside or outside?

327
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,160
The room was soundproofed.

328
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,930
I never heard anything except a disembodied voice of a loudspeaker.

329
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,840
- Describe it.  - But I've already done that.

330
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,200
Again!

331
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,910
It was the voice of a man, no accent.

332
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:25,350
- Doctored up electronically. Unrecognizable.  - How many of them were there?

333
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,850
Two. A man and a woman.

334
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:33,150
- Why do you say that?  - Because the faintest light filtered down from above.

335
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,760
But not enough to give me a chance to see who they were.

336
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,990
- Yes, and who did the cooking?  - She did.

337
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,730
- Why?  - Because a man would not bother to put the parsley...

338
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,730
on the filet of sole, that's why.

339
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,170
- How old is she?  - Come on, now. Please.

340
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:50,140
- How old is she?  - Twenty-five.

341
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,310
- Why?  - Why?

342
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,810
Because if a man my age is gonna get kidnapped by a woman,

343
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,300
he wants her to be 25, that's why.

344
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,480
- Describe your return.  - The return.

345
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,650
The disembodied voice tells me to sit with my back to the door.

346
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,020
The light goes out, the door opens, they both come in.

347
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,930
I feel a prick in my left arm.

348
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:16,130
The next thing I know, I wake up in that hospital bed...

349
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:19,630
with you sitting there, thinking up questions!

350
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,240
Thank you, Mr. Constantine. You're doing great.

351
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,610
- That's what you think.  - All right, let's start all over again.

352
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,570
Aw, shit!

353
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,640
Why, Henry, you have such a beaming smile on your face.

354
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,980
I smile because I'm happy, Blanche.

355
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,680
It comes through you, Blanche, from your friend, Ida Cookson.

356
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,450
I'm her guide, Henry.

357
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:13,120
Friendship can be claimed only when it cannot be denied.

358
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,120
Tell Ida Cookson we're all thankful here...

359
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,630
for the warm tranquility in her heart.

360
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,530
It will grow even warmer as she trusts in you,

361
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:27,470
and confides in you, and holds back no secrets from you...

362
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:32,240
be they her own, or those of her intimate friends.

363
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,970
Did you hear that, Mrs. Cookson?

364
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,980
Yes, Madame Blanche.

365
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,810
Henry, I want you to seek Walter for us now.

366
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,750
Search through to the Double Strand of Kindness, until...

367
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,220
my friend Ida Cookson is joined in loving communication...

368
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,430
with her dear, departed husband.

369
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,730
I will try, Blanche.

370
00:28:55,730 --> 00:29:00,070
But first, the mist must part a little, and the veil must rise...

371
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:04,240
to let in the light that will show us the path.

372
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,610
Ah, I'm ready now, Henry.

373
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:11,180
Ready! Ready to follow you, wherever you want me to go.

374
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:14,280
Where? Where are you taking me, Henry?

375
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,580
Yes, yes, yes! I see.

376
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:20,190
I see your hand beckoning to me.

377
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:23,660
Oh, what a lovely garden, Henry.

378
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,430
My, my. Oh!

379
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,400
Is that... Is that a statue there?

380
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,630
Oh! Could this be Walter standing beside the fountain?

381
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,910
- How can you do this to me?  - I need your car keys.

382
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,910
- I'm in a hurry.  - Oh!

383
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,110
Do you realize what damage you can do my psyche, breaking in this way?

384
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,310
Just give me your keys. I need 'em.

385
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,310
Yes, Henry! What for?

386
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,320
I've located the daughter of the Rainbird chauffeur.

387
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,720
- And I'm not going as a cab driver.  - Oh!

388
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,290
- What am I supposed to do without my car?  - I don't care what you do.

389
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,690
- Take a taxi. Just give me the keys.  - The trees are swaying!

390
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,160
And the branches part!

391
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,760
But there's no one there! Here.

392
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,400
I see shadows falling! The air is getting cold!

393
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,300
The brightness... dims. Good-bye, Henry!

394
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,270
Oh!

395
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,240
Did you find Walter?

396
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,010
- Where?  - In the kitchen.

397
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,910
I did.

398
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,000
I wonder if I could speak to you for a couple minutes, Mrs. Hannagan.

399
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,770
Why, sure. Do we know each other?

400
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:45,910
No, I'm Frank McBride, of the law firm of Ferguson, Ferguson & McBride,

401
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:50,680
and I just wondered if you would mind... answering a couple questions about your background.

402
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,680
- My background?  - Mm-hmm.

403
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,680
Dull as dishwater.

404
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,480
I mean, what in the world would you be wanting with that?

405
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,950
Well, let's just say that the, uh,

406
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:03,660
information that I'm interested in could be won'th a great deal of money.

407
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,890
Oh, yeah? To who?

408
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,830
Well, we'll get around to that pleasant little subject in a minute, if you don't mind.

409
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,870
- Okay.  - Oh, swell.

410
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,800
Now, why don't we just start at the beginning?

411
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,070
- Your parents.  - Oh, they're both dead. God rest 'em.

412
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,710
- Your father was a chauffeur, though, right?  - How did you know that?

413
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:26,480
He was a chauffeur for the Rainbird family.

414
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,420
Right again! You'd be a hell of a detective, Mr. McBride.

415
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,920
I don't know about that, my dear.

416
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,990
Now, during this period of time, though, can you remember anybody, uh,

417
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,390
being a close friend of your father's?

418
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:44,700
Uh, there was a man. It was away back when I was in school.

419
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,170
Uh, there was this guy that my father used to drink beer with...

420
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,600
and shoot pool with down in the village.

421
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,370
This Harry Shoebridge had a poultry shop with his wife, Sadie.

422
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,380
Shoebridge.

423
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,380
Yeah. His business was always lousy,

424
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,310
even when times were good.

425
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,350
And she used to have miscarriages...

426
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,850
like other women have birthdays.

427
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:08,820
Well, they stopped trying, and they moved away...

428
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,430
to Barlow Creek, and, uh, adopted a kid, I think.

429
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,730
- A boy?  - Yeah. An infant.

430
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,700
But, you know, I'm not so sure.

431
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,730
I... It's all kind of hazy, an-and, uh,

432
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,400
I keep connecting it with...

433
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,310
Well, I remember this night...

434
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:33,180
with my Dad driving over there... to the Shoebridge's all alone, and then getting in...

435
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,450
a big fight with Ma because he'd come home at 4:00 A.M.,

436
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,790
and he wouldn't tell her what he was doing or something.

437
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:44,020
Now, after my dad passed away... God rest his soul...

438
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,830
my ma was damn mad at the Shoebridge's,

439
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,360
because they never showed up at the funeral.

440
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,330
- Then she found out why.  - Why?

441
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:57,300
A year earlier, they'd gone to their own funeral.

442
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,970
- Dead?  - Mm-hmm.

443
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:03,740
- Their house burned down with them in it.  - Well, what about the son?

444
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,380
Mrs. Hannagan! Can't you see that there are customers?

445
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,120
- Oh, yes. Yes. I'll be right there.  - She'll be right there, ma'am.

446
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,890
Uh-Uh, look, um, Mr. McBride,

447
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:16,250
- about all this being won'th something...  - Mrs. Hannagan!

448
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,330
- Yeah.  - Wait a second.

449
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,960
This Shoebridge son... where do I look for him?

450
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,960
Well, try the Barlow Creek Cemetery.

451
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,440
- What do you mean, the cemetery?  - Well, I'm not sure, but I think he's dead, too.

452
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,870
Sorry!

453
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,790
Dead end, Blanche.

454
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,230
Dead and buried.

455
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:04,120
- Caretaker. Do somethir for you?  - I'm a friend of the family.

456
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:11,160
None left. Bad business, that.

457
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,600
You mean the fire?

458
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,770
Never liked them multiple funerals.

459
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,760
Too much work involved, all at one time.

460
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:26,680
They died together, yet they're not... buried together in the same hole.

461
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,250
How come?

462
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:32,440
Search me.

463
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,220
Here. Look.

464
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,640
Died in 1950. Died 1950.

465
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,640
Died 1950.

466
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,500
Both died the same date.

467
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:00,380
Old stone.

468
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,740
This is practically new stone.

469
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,010
- Smart fellow, ain't ya?  - Why? Have I stumbled on to something?

470
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:13,930
Well, nice meetir ya.

471
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:18,520
Better get back to my work. I got a job comir in here tomorrow.

472
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,520
Turn that damn thing down, Marcella.

473
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,090
Can't even hear myself think.

474
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:46,430
How do you expect me to remember anything that far back?

475
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,660
I'd have to go through my old files for that kind of information.

476
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,130
Well, Mr. Wheeler, I hate to insist...

477
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:55,940
You know something, Mr. McBride?

478
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,100
You lawyers are all alike.

479
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,070
Trouble, trouble, trouble.

480
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,210
Well, come on. I don't have all day.

481
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:07,050
What year did you say the family died?

482
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,480
Uh, 1950.

483
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,880
What month?

484
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,540
Ah, I can't help you there.

485
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,860
- Shoebridge. Shoebri...  - Can I sit down?  - Yeah, go ahead.

486
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,430
Shoebridge. Shoebridge.

487
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:26,000
Oh, here it is. "Shoebridge: Harry and Sadie.

488
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,070
"Large marble. Model 28.

489
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,570
"Paid in full. Check number 93.

490
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:34,870
First Church of Latter Day Saints, Barlow Creek."

491
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,780
What about the son?

492
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:42,010
- Edward Shoebridge. He's their son.  - Edward?

493
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,180
- Yeah.  - Okay. Nope.

494
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,020
- Nothing.  - What do you mean, nothing?

495
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,720
There's gotta be something. Maybe it came later.

496
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,690
Wait a minute. You're talking about Eddie Shoebridge. His headstone? Yeah, that did come later.

497
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:58,430
I think in, uh, '65.

498
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,600
Sure, I remember that kid.

499
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,500
He wasrt too popular around here. Some say he set that fire himself...

500
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,670
to get rid of his family, and then disappeared...

501
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,640
to make it look like he died in the fire too.

502
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,610
- They never did find his body.  - You mean, there's no body in that grave?

503
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:16,150
Well, as I recollect, that's why the local parson...

504
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,320
wouldn't say any services for Eddie.

505
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,290
Well, Wasrt there a death certificate?

506
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:25,490
I wouldn't know about that. And I don't need to know.

507
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:28,120
I'm just a businessman, Mr. McBride.

508
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:32,530
Ah, here it is.

509
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:35,900
"Edward Shoebridge. Granite special.

510
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,240
"Ordered, November 12.

511
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,910
"Paid for, November 18, 1965.

512
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,340
$395."

513
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,710
Now, that's funny. It's paid in cash.

514
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,820
- They don't usually do that.  - Who was it?

515
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,820
I don't know, Mr. McBride.

516
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,250
I guess he didn't want his name known.

517
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,990
Well, what do you mean, he?

518
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:03,480
- You just said he.  - I did, didn't I?

519
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,070
Well, you know, I seem to sort of remember... that it was a man.

520
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,610
Yeah. A young fella.

521
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:18,640
Slightly bald. I'd say in his late twenties.

522
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,020
And did you see him again when you, uh... Put in the headstone?

523
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:27,150
We didn't do that. He came by and picked it up himself.

524
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:30,860
Yes, I remember now. In one of those tow trucks.

525
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:34,390
- You know, the kind that garages use?  - Gotcha.

526
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,000
No, there is no death certificate here for Edward Shoebridge,

527
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,600
only Harry J. Shoebridge and Sadie L. Shoebridge.

528
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,540
That's all you have?

529
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,850
Well, there is this.

530
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,740
It appears to be an application for a death certificate...

531
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:02,120
for one Edward Shoebridge, dated November 4, 1965.

532
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,720
"Inasmuch as applicant could furnish no proof of death...

533
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,730
"for party whose body had never been found,

534
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,330
"and who could supply no medical death certificate,

535
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:13,130
"and nothing from the coroner's office, the application was denied.

536
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:15,900
"Applicant, when informed he could file a petition for court action,

537
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,470
declined the suggestion."

538
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,840
Does it say who the applicant was?

539
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,680
Yes. "Request was made by Joseph P. Maloney,

540
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,150
426 Main Street, Barlow Creek."

541
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,910
- Attagirl. Thank you.  - You're welcome.

542
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,590
- Fill 'er up?  - Please.

543
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:01,810
- You want to check under the hood?  - If you would, please.

544
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:15,350
- Better be careful with those matches.  - Oh. Right.

545
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,950
Sorry.

546
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:23,660
- This your place?  - Yeah.

547
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,530
Then you must be, uh, "J. Maloney."

548
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:33,070
Tell me, does that stand for, uh, John orJim?

549
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,810
- Joe.  - Right.

550
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:38,380
Everything's okay.

551
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,980
Funny, uh, you didn't hardly need any gas.

552
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:51,960
Didrt need no oil... Guess you didn't come here for the car, huh, mister?

553
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,960
Could you get my windshield, please?

554
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,590
Don't worry.

555
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,770
You wouldn't happen to know a guy by the name of Edward Shoebridge, would ya?

556
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:06,240
Used to live around here.

557
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,580
Name don't ring no bell with me.

558
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,910
What would you be wantir with this, uh, what's his name, uh, Shoebridge?

559
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:17,450
Yeah. Legal matter.

560
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:20,220
- You a lawyer?  - Yeah.

561
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,360
Name's McBride. Frank McBride.

562
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,290
First time I ever talked to a lawyer didn't cost me money.

563
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:32,030
Actually, Mr. Maloney, by talking to me you could make yourself some money.

564
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:36,440
- Yeah?  - I'm prepared to pay a reasonable sum of cash,

565
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:41,470
right now, for any information that could lead me to Eddie Shoebridge.

566
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,680
Where I come from, lawyers are usually bad news.

567
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,350
Oh, no. Not this time. This time they're good news.

568
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:51,650
Matter of fact, I think that Eddie Shoebridge... would be delighted when he hears from me.

569
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:53,850
What are you gonna tell him?

570
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:57,360
Well, my client has asked me to keep that confidential.

571
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,220
Who hired you to find this guy?

572
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,860
- That's confidential also.  - Sure like to help you, Mister...

573
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,200
Business ain't all that good around here.

574
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,570
- I think you can help me.  - Is that right?

575
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:15,070
Mm-hmm. See, people around here have been telling me that Eddie Shoebridge is dead.

576
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:20,350
Well, if he's dead, looks like he ain't gonna be hearir... all that good news you have to tell him, huh?

577
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:25,550
I think he's alive.

578
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,650
Sure don't keep this car very clean.

579
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:31,410
You want to tell me why you put a headstone on an empty grave, Maloney?

580
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,690
What headstone?

581
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:39,760
The one you paid $395 for back in 1965.

582
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,600
You owe me $2.47, mister.

583
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:49,540
Two weeks before that, you went to the county courthouse...and asked for a certificate of death for Edward Shoebridge,

584
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,030
and you were turned down.

585
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,820
- You wanna give me your credit card?  - No.

586
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:01,050
Credit cards are out.

587
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:11,430
Like you, I prefer to pay... in cash.

588
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,750
Now, this one happens to be my personal favorite.

589
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,960
Isn't it exquisite?

590
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,830
Probably too expensive for me.

591
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:42,990
Can I help you, sir?

592
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:51,570
Excuse me. I'll be right back. Uh, Mrs. Clay?

593
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,940
Would you take care of Mrs. Cunningham for a few moments?

594
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:58,670
Certainly, Mr. Adamson.

595
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:03,710
I'm afraid I rather like it.

596
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,220
Hey, Eddie. You old son of a bitch.

597
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,990
If it's all the same to you, I prefer Arthur Adamson.

598
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:13,730
Now what in the hell are you doing here?

599
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:17,300
Had to see you about something kind of urgent. That's all, Eddie... Arthur.

600
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,800
- Couldrt you have phoned me?  - Some things you don't put on no telephone.

601
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,060
Hey, uh, you got any booze around?

602
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,510
All right, Joseph. What is it this time?

603
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:38,180
New freezer for your wife?

604
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:42,120
Mother needs another operation? Bookies threatened to kill you? What?

605
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,960
Aw, come on, Eddie. You make me sound like some kind of sponger.

606
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,990
Not that I ain't grateful for all your favors.

607
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:51,160
- Did I ever have a choice?  - Okay, okay. Here it is.

608
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,370
First off, I gotta ask you a question.

609
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:59,370
- Go ahead.  - I'm tellir ya. No shit now, Eddie.

610
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:03,330
Can you think of any reason why anyone would be sniffir around in your life... after all these years?

611
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:10,350
I can't think of any reason at all. Why?

612
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,890
Well, there's this guy comes around the garage today...

613
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:17,220
tryir to locate Eddie Shoebridge.

614
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,520
Claims he's a lawyer, he's got good news for ya.

615
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,360
Wort say what, or who he's workir for.

616
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,850
Calls himself McBride. I know he's a phony the minute I see him.

617
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:29,000
- Police?  - No way. He's a real amateur.

618
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,500
I traced his license plates with the bureau...

619
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,270
Doesrt even drive his own car.

620
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:40,600
"Blanche Tyler, 17 Castle Heights Road."

621
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,250
- What did he look like?  - He's tall, thin, about 35.

622
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:50,120
He's always got a pipe on. Asking a lot of smart-ass questions.

623
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:55,530
- What'd you tell him?  - Nothir. Not a goddamn thing.

624
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:57,530
I didn't have to. He knew everything...

625
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:59,870
fake headstone you had me put up,

626
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,800
how I tried to get you officially declared dead.

627
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,270
The son of a bitch says he thinks you're still alive.

628
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:08,110
He's lookir for you, Eddie.

629
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:10,840
And any son of a bitch who's lookir for you...

630
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,470
is lookir for me.

631
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,390
Well,

632
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:24,060
whatever he's up to, he won't find me.

633
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,790
You worry too much, Joseph.

634
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:30,060
Yeah, I worry too much, because you only planned the fire,

635
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:33,030
and locked your old man and old lady in the bedroom.

636
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:37,640
- I poured the gasoline. I lit the rags.  - And I thank you.

637
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,470
The happiest day of my whole, inglorious childhood.

638
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:44,980
All right, you want to kid about it, it's all right with me.

639
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:49,070
- I'm gonna track this guy down.  - And then what?

640
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,350
This.

641
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:58,790
- You'll never change, will you?  - You got no cause to complain.

642
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:04,000
- When you needed me, I was always there, wasrt I?  - Look, put that thing away.

643
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,630
And listen to me. I want you to go back to Barlow Creek.

644
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,630
Do nothing, say nothing.

645
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:13,400
Let me look into this matter in my own, quiet way.

646
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:17,940
And if I need you for anything, I'll contact you.

647
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,440
Okay?

648
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:27,990
You're the boss, Arthur.

649
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:31,890
Isn't it touching how... a perfect murder...

650
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:35,090
has kept our friendship alive all these years?

651
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:38,200
You better believe it.

652
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,870
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Adamson.

653
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:45,390
There are two gentlemen here to see you, from the police department.

654
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,840
Tell them I'll be right out.

655
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,010
Jesus Christ, Eddie!

656
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:54,440
Wait here.

657
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:11,500
- Arthur Adamson. What can I do for you gentlemen?  - Sorry to bother you.

658
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:15,300
Andy Bush, Bureau of Inspectors, and this is Lieutenant Peterson.

659
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,300
- Hi.  - My pleasure.

660
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:21,310
No doubt you've been reading, or hearing, about the Constantine kidnapping.

661
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:23,610
Well, I have a confession to make, Inspector.

662
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:26,710
When I heard of the size of that stone, my mouth watered.

663
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:29,480
Professionally speaking, of course.

664
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,120
Well, just so you don't feel discriminated against, Mr. Adamson,

665
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:37,490
we're routinely covering every gem dealer and jewelry store in the city.

666
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:40,490
Well, I'm flattered.

667
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:45,530
Have you, by any chance, noticed anything out of the ordinary, Mr. Adamson?

668
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:51,140
Any unusual movement of large... or small... stones into the markets these last few days?

669
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:54,140
- Absolutely not.  - I see.

670
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:59,310
I take it that you're going on the assumption... that this, uh, "ransom stone" has been cut up into smaller gems?

671
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:02,410
- That's correct, sir.  - It makes a lot of sense.

672
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,450
We think so.

673
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:07,020
If I may presume to make a suggestion,

674
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:11,420
it seems to me you ought to be covering the antique and secondhand jewelry markets.

675
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:16,630
They buy from anyone, whereas we jewelers buy exclusively on the wholesale exchanges.

676
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:19,870
- That's already being done, Mr. Adamson.  - Oh!

677
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:23,270
I think we've taken up enough of Mr. Adamsors time.

678
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:26,670
Well, I'm sorry I haven't been able to be of more help to you.

679
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:31,380
However, if I do hear of any unusual transactions in the marketplace,

680
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,380
I'll be sure and contact you.

681
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:37,320
- Yes, we'd appreciate that. Much obliged.  - Take care.

682
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,810
- Good-bye, sir.  - Good day. And good luck!

683
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,970
Mrs. Clay, close up as soon as you wish. I have some work to do in here.

684
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:03,240
I'll let myself out the back way.

685
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,680
- Good night.  - Good night.

686
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:18,650
- Your friend, Blanche Tyler, is a spiritualist.  - A spiritualist?

687
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:23,020
That's what it says on her shingle. Also, there's no one home.

688
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:26,550
A spirit is never at home. Get in.

689
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,900
What do you think we should do?

690
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:37,840
We'll wait. We still don't know who the man is yet.

691
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,270
- Must you?  - Mm-hmm.

692
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,650
That must be her.

693
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:28,050
That must be the fellow with the pipe who called on Maloney.

694
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:30,020
A cab driver.

695
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,790
Lumley. Lumley, what's this? Where are ya goir?

696
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:35,990
I'm going home to my own bed where I can get some sleep.

697
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:37,600
No, you're not.

698
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,470
Blanche, is that all you've ever got on your mind?

699
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,900
What are you saving it for, a rainy day?

700
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,990
Honey, you never know when you're gonna need it.

701
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,210
You're not being friendly, Lumley.

702
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:51,410
Blanche, I'm too pooped to pop. I'd be useless to you.

703
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:53,780
You're always useless to me!

704
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:57,320
You're always pooping out when I need you!

705
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,220
we can collect a huge sum of money, You call that useless?

706
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:03,420
You know what I'm talking about. Come on in side and stop being difficult.

707
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,560
Not tonight, Josephine. I'm outta here.

708
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,050
- You're a fink!  - If I'm a fink, you're an ungrateful bitch.

709
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:12,060
- What about tomorrow?  - What about it?

710
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:15,470
You've got important work to do. I want you to be sure about Eddie Shoe...

711
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:17,800
Talk to him!

712
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,210
How many times are you going to tell me that?

713
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:25,180
How many times am I gonna have to tell you that tomorrow I have to work in my cab?

714
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:27,640
So it'll wait till Sunday.

715
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:48,400
You better give me a quick synopsis. I'm confused.

716
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,740
Simple. A cab driver is shacked up...

717
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,200
with a sex-starved medium named Blanche Tyler.

718
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,910
Don't ask me why, but apparently they're on the trail... of some spook named Eddie Shoebridge.

719
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:02,080
Fortunately, not on the trail of your favorite kidnapper and mine.

720
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,080
How can you be so sure?

721
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,050
You did hear him talk about collecting a huge hunk of money.

722
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:09,920
Couldrt that be the reward that's on our heads?

723
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,520
You got yourself a point there, Frances, old girl.

724
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,430
Only time will tell whether it's any good.

725
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:17,430
One thing's certain.

726
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:21,460
We're not going to change our game plan. Not now.

727
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:25,100
Buy me a drink, Arthur.

728
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:28,070
A shiny car.

729
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:30,940
A... limousine?

730
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:33,450
Why does he drive so fast, Henry?

731
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,510
What's that? On the seat beside him?

732
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:42,150
I hear the sound of a baby crying. Quick, Henry, before he disappears.

733
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:45,520
Ask...Yes, I know.

734
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,930
I...see him now.

735
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:53,770
The uniform. A chauffeur.

736
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:56,470
What? Henry, I need words.

737
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:58,470
Who? The what?

738
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:01,840
The Rainbird chauffeur?

739
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:05,540
Good heavens. Old Michael O'Keefe, our chauffeur.

740
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:08,410
Where is Michael going?

741
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:12,480
Henry, ask him where he's taking Harriet's baby.

742
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,290
Oh, more pictures are coming in too fast.

743
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:18,060
I can hardly make them out.

744
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:21,430
Henry, a graveyard, a headstone?

745
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,860
I don't like this, Henry.

746
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,870
A shoe. Bridge.

747
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:31,100
A shoe bridge? Oh, don't do this to me, Henry.

748
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,770
- Speak to the chauffeur.  - Oh, God, something's burning.

749
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:38,780
The house. Quick, Henry. The house is on fire.

750
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:41,180
Take me away from here.

751
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:43,210
I don't want to see this.

752
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:46,890
I can't bear the sound of their awful screaming.

753
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:50,120
Go back to the chauffeur, Henry. Get Michael into our presence.

754
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,220
Miss Rainbird remembers him.

755
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:55,390
Yes, I remember.

756
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:58,130
Madame Blanche, listen to me.

757
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:02,030
Can you hear me?

758
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:06,170
I've remembered something else that could be terribly important.

759
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:09,610
Wait one minute, Henry. Before you go,

760
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:13,910
Miss Rainbird deserves some kind of assurance about Harriet's child.

761
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:16,680
He's a man by now,

762
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:20,150
and we have to know, is he happy, Henry?

763
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:23,880
Is he alive and well and happy?

764
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:27,590
If you can't, you can't.

765
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:30,360
I certainly can't force you.

766
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:34,500
Yes. Of course she'll understand.

767
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:38,700
Until next time, then. Good-bye.

768
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,140
Good-bye, my love.

769
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,270
- What happened?  - Don't you remember?

770
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:52,550
- Not a blessed thing.  - Oh, it doesn't matter now.

771
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:55,090
Listen, listen, Madame Blanche.

772
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:59,790
Your Henry jogged my memory of something I'd completely forgotten.

773
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:03,930
When our poor old chauffeur, Mike, realized he was dying,

774
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:08,130
he wrote to me and said there was one person on earth...

775
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:11,040
who had promised that he'd make it his business...

776
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:15,540
to know where Harriet's son was as long as he lived.

777
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:20,810
It was the parson who baptized the newborn baby.

778
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:24,080
And there's an additional thing I can tell you.

779
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:28,250
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

780
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:31,790
- Five hundred.  - Not a penny. Not even a hundred for expenses.

781
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:33,790
It's all or nothing, George,

782
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:36,330
until I can produce his name and his present address.

783
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:40,530
- Jesus, Blanche.  - However, she gave me a marvelous clue.

784
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:43,500
- Here we go again.  - No, here you go again...

785
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:46,540
to the man who might tell you if Shoebridge is dead or alive.

786
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:50,680
- Who's that?  - Bishop Wood at St. Anselm's Cathedral.

787
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,610
- Holy Christ, Blanche.  - No, George, not him.

788
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:56,250
Bishop Wood at St. Anselm's Cathedral.

789
01:00:56,250 --> 01:01:00,680
He was a parson once and he baptized the Shoebridge baby.

790
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,930
Excuse me.

791
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:56,310
Sorry.

792
01:01:56,310 --> 01:02:00,710
Do you know how I could, uh, make a date to see Bishop Wood?

793
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:05,780
If you want to make the appointment today, you'll have to make it through the chaplain.

794
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:08,350
Which one is the chaplain?

795
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:11,620
When the service is over, I'll show you where to go.

796
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:38,640
Oh, dear.

797
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:22,520
You know he's moving. You sure you gave him enough?

798
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:26,260
Just the usual dose. He looks so harmless.

799
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:29,430
When I was a little kid living in that village,

800
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:32,300
he always made me feel like I was something evil.

801
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:36,230
- And look at me now.  - I feel years younger.

802
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:39,400
You know, one more like this one today, and we'll be naturally gray.

803
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:43,740
It was an incredible job. I really think it's won'th more than a million.

804
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:46,430
I'm sorry, darling, but I'm not going back...

805
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:49,250
and rewrite my ransom note that I left in my prayer book.

806
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:52,280
You'll have to be a good sport and settle for a million.

807
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:54,990
You were beautiful, Fran. Just beautiful.

808
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:58,790
- I was scared.  - I told you it'd be all right, didn't I?

809
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:01,560
People in church are inibited.

810
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:06,100
They don't jump up and run around and make a lot of noise. They're all too religiously polite.

811
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:10,970
Shall we go on congratulating ourselves, or would you like to talk about him now?

812
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:13,700
- Who?  - "Who."

813
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,410
The man with the pipe.

814
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:20,680
- So you saw him there, huh?  - Larger than life.

815
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,680
Larger than death, you mean.

816
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,980
There's no doubt about who he's after now.

817
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:27,280
What were you planning to do about him, dear,

818
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,520
besides just not telling me?

819
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,060
I'm not planning to do anything about him.

820
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:36,630
Joe Maloney's been itching for that job. He's got it.

821
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:40,300
I'll phone him as soon as we put our guest in his quarters.

822
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:43,730
I was right about that silly cab driver.

823
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:46,340
For once in my life I hate being right.

824
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:51,210
Well, how in the hell could he have known we were going to be there... when you and I are the only two people in the world who knew that?

825
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:53,210
I've got a thought.

826
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:55,880
- It's a dumb one.  - Say it.

827
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,010
Do you believe in E.S.P.?

828
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:01,420
Extra sensory perception, all that psychic phenomena?

829
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:04,320
What do you mean? Madame What's-her-name?

830
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,820
Blanche Tyler.

831
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,090
Jesus.

832
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:14,500
You and I know that that's off the wall, but, uh, can we afford to be wrong?

833
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:20,040
I'm afraid our two quarrelsome lovers are going to have to share a fatal accident.

834
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,470
Oh, my God.

835
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:25,780
But Maloney wouldn't be willing to do that, would he?

836
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:29,550
Of course he'd be willing. Gladly.

837
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:33,550
He'd believe he was protecting himself and his old buddy.

838
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:36,550
I don't want to know about it. Okay?

839
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:39,760
- Promise me, Arthur.  - Come on, now, dear.

840
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,130
That's what's so exciting about all of this.

841
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:47,190
We move as one. Everything together. Nothing held back.

842
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:22,130
It was gross negligence, losing him that way. He was all we had.

843
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:25,070
I didn't lose him. He was kidnapped.

844
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:30,740
Why would anyone want to do that to a bishop?

845
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:34,370
For the ransom, dummy. It's a million dollars.

846
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:41,920
I can't get over it. You know, I was right there.

847
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:46,650
Tsk. Oh, forget about the million. What about out 10,000?

848
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:51,590
We've got nowhere to go now, Lumley.

849
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,400
What am I gonna tell Miss Rainbird?

850
01:06:55,400 --> 01:07:00,040
I suppose Henry and I are going to have to exhaust ourselves again doing your work for you.

851
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:03,560
What d'ya mean, my work? My work is driving a goddamn cab, for Christ's sake.

852
01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:07,040
And startir right this minute, that's exact...

853
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:10,410
- That's exact what? Go ahead.  - Answer the telephone.

854
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:18,590
Hello? Who?

855
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:20,720
Mr. Maloney?

856
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,930
Barlow Creek? Go ahead.

857
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:27,060
Hello.

858
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:29,700
Can you speak a little louder, Mr. Maloney?

859
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:34,240
I said I traced you through the license plates on that car your lawyer friend was driving.

860
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,340
I figured if you was still lookir for some dope on Eddie Shoebridge,

861
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:39,840
- I might have somethir for you.  - Oh.

862
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:42,610
How come you changed your mind, Mr. Maloney?

863
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:46,820
I didn't say nothir to your man 'cause I felt it was none of my business and none of his,

864
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:49,320
but I been thinkir about it and how I could use the bread.

865
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:52,020
So for a little consideration, I'm willing to lead you to someone...

866
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:54,160
who knows Eddie Shoebridge's wife.

867
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:57,130
It'll cost you a grand.

868
01:07:57,130 --> 01:07:59,860
Oh, don't be silly, Mr. Maloney.

869
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:02,070
I have my lawyer right here beside me,

870
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:06,830
and he says he'll give you $100 provided it leads to something. Make it two.

871
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:12,410
Oh... All right. It's a deal.

872
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:14,940
- Where do we meet?  - You and that lawyer friend of yours,

873
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:17,750
you drive up and meet me at Abe and Mabel's in two hours.

874
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:22,590
- Abe and Mabel's?  - It's a cafe up the road to Mt. Sherman,

875
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:26,480
about five miles off Route 22. You know where it is?

876
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:29,990
Yeah. Why so far away? Can't we meet somewhere more convenient?

877
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:33,660
This party I'm gonna take you to happens to be up in that area.

878
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:37,830
I see. Mr. Maloney, are you admitting Edward Shoebridge is still alive?

879
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:41,200
I ain't sayir a thing till I see the color of your money, in two hours.

880
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,780
- What d'ya think?  - Smells fishy to me.

881
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:48,780
I know.

882
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:52,480
But even fish smells good when you're starving to death.

883
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:55,420
What have we got to lose? He's the only clue left.

884
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:59,060
You got $200 on you?

885
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,060
You know me better than that.

886
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:05,230
Of course not. Fix me another one of these.

887
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:09,630
You don't need another one. You already got one. We only got two hours to get there.

888
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:12,800
- I'll eat it in the car.  - Come on.

889
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,170
You're impossible.

890
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:50,670
A couple of beers, please.

891
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:58,760
He must be late.

892
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:25,500
Thank you, dear.

893
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:38,210
You kids sit over there.

894
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:49,030
- How was Sunday school today?  - Noisy.

895
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:51,790
- Five Cokes, please.  - We didn't make any noise.

896
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:53,800
That's right. That's why you're here.

897
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,590
Don't blame me.

898
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:24,030
Did I say anything?

899
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:34,000
- Hello. I'm sorry I'm late.  - I'll get you a chair.

900
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,440
- That's all right. I'll sit over here.  - I'll join you.

901
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:48,350
Look at that. Nice arrangement.

902
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:51,480
Don't be obscene, George.

903
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,400
Oh.

904
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,400
Thank you, my dear.

905
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:12,000
Just see that you keep you head screwed on straight, will you?

906
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:26,090
He's not coming.

907
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:43,700
Well, that's the end of that.

908
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:58,180
George, what's the big hurry?

909
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:06,360
Just slow down a little, will ya, please?

910
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:11,330
I told you not to drive so fast, George!

911
01:15:11,330 --> 01:15:14,420
I don't know what's wrong. The accelerator seems to be sticking.

912
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,170
George, for God's sake, slow up, will ya?

913
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:21,240
I can't.

914
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,670
My hamburger's coming up.

915
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:26,610
The accelerator... is stuck.

916
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:29,080
Use the brakes!

917
01:15:31,310 --> 01:15:33,750
- They don't work.  - What?

918
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:38,310
- The brakes don't work.  - What do you mean?

919
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,930
- George!  - Come on, woman. Don't grab me, for God's sake!

920
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:48,100
It's not me. It's the brakes don't work.

921
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:51,900
I'm getting violently ill, George.

922
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:55,740
- You're chokir me, Blanche, for Christ's sake!  - George!

923
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:59,140
Do something!

924
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:09,150
Grab the brake! Reach down and pull the hand brake.

925
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:11,250
- Pull on it!  - I am pulling!

926
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:13,420
Get your hands off the steering wheel. Pull on it!

927
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:15,860
- I am pulling.  - Pull it.

928
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:20,090
Come on.

929
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,930
Get your hand off the goddamn wheel!

930
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:09,630
I gotta get off this road.

931
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:14,710
Blanche, just hang on.

932
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:31,190
Wasrt that fun?

933
01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:34,530
- Damn you, George Lumley!  - What's the matter with you?

934
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:37,300
- It was't me. It's Maloney.  - He was't driving!

935
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:40,340
Of course, but he screwed up the car and broke the brakes.

936
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:42,710
- Maloney?  - Yes.

937
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:45,910
You think it's a coincidence, Blanche?

938
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:48,340
Huh?

939
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:54,080
Your car... is gonna be out of commission for a couple days.

940
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:58,280
So let's go find us another way to get home.

941
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:02,930
George. Are you all right?

942
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:06,700
Mm-hmm. I think so. How about you?

943
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:10,530
I'm okay. I'm sorry.

944
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:16,940
- Do you really think Maloney wanted us dead?  - Mm-hmm.

945
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:22,180
Why, in the name of God, would anyone want to do that to us?

946
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:24,180
I don't know,

947
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:28,220
but you can bet is has something to do with your mysterious friend, Eddie Shoebridge.

948
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:30,990
Maloney's probably got him buried in his backyard.

949
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:34,220
Doesrt want us to find out.

950
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,920
That way.

951
01:20:41,990 --> 01:20:43,990
Hi there. Sorry I'm late.

952
01:20:43,990 --> 01:20:47,760
Congratulations on the nice job you did on our car, Maloney.

953
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,970
What are you two doir standir in the middle of the road?

954
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:54,040
You know perfectly well what we're doing on the road, Maloney.

955
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:57,570
You must be Blanche Tyler. Pleased to meet ya. Where's your car?

956
01:20:57,570 --> 01:21:00,680
Let's just say it ain't in runnir order, you know what I mean?

957
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:02,880
Hop in. I'll give ya a lift to the nearest station.

958
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:06,310
No, thank you. We don't ride in hearses.

959
01:21:07,450 --> 01:21:09,450
You think I came up here for the fun of it?

960
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:12,120
Then you want me to take you to this party that knows Eddie Shoebridge's wife.

961
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:17,620
Why don't you just go ahead, uh, by yourself this time, Maloney. We'll skip it.

962
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:30,140
He's all charm.

963
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:16,690
Who's that?

964
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:19,520
That's Maloney. He's after us.

965
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,790
Come on.

966
01:22:31,270 --> 01:22:33,700
Hey, guys, let's get the hell outta here.

967
01:23:03,130 --> 01:23:05,600
We better get the police.

968
01:23:07,670 --> 01:23:10,100
And lose our $10,000?

969
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:40,000
May I be of some help to you, madam?

970
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,240
- I'd like to see some bracelets.  - Any particular kind?

971
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:48,400
Do you have anything with turquoise, or perhaps pearls?

972
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:58,920
- Anything wrong with our houseguest?  - He's fine.

973
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:03,490
I gave him a very nice lunch and a fresh bottle of wine.

974
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:07,430
- Maybe one of these will appeal to you?  - Are those seed pearls?

975
01:24:07,430 --> 01:24:09,860
That's right.

976
01:24:12,770 --> 01:24:17,100
- What are you doing here?  - These look like freshwater pearls.

977
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,710
The message has come through on KFAG.

978
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:23,510
They've located the stone we asked for.

979
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:25,880
In New York. Harry Winston.

980
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:28,320
Fifty-three carats.

981
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:33,290
These are very nice. How much are they?

982
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:37,930
$315, including tax.

983
01:24:37,930 --> 01:24:40,530
When do we make the pickup?

984
01:24:40,530 --> 01:24:43,370
Tomorrow night, 9:30.

985
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:46,770
Good. Now go on home.

986
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:49,670
Would it be possible for you to set these aside...

987
01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:51,940
so that I can bring in my husband and he can look at them?

988
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:53,940
Of course, madam.

989
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:57,710
Now for the bad news.

990
01:24:57,710 --> 01:24:59,480
Take a look at this.

991
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:17,430
Incompetent bastard. He blew it.

992
01:25:17,430 --> 01:25:21,200
Now we'll have to eliminate these two ourselves.

993
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:24,540
- Ourselves?  - That's right.

994
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:28,370
Tomorrow night, right after we return our guest.

995
01:25:29,810 --> 01:25:32,540
- I can't.  - You must.

996
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:38,820
Remember: Share and share alike.

997
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:42,920
You stop it! Stop it!

998
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,870
- Decide on something?  - That'll be fine.

999
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:52,000
I'll have it wrapped.

1000
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,740
But it was more than that, much more than that...

1001
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:59,780
that you left behind as your precious gift to life.

1002
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:04,450
Yes, Joseph Maloney, you were a generous man.

1003
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:06,950
You gave of your heart and soul.

1004
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:09,580
You gave the very best that was in you,

1005
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:13,760
and no more than that can be asked of mortal man on this earth.

1006
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,630
You loved your wife dearly.

1007
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:19,700
You bestowed upon your dear mother and father...

1008
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:23,430
all the care, all the attention,

1009
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:28,190
patience and comfort that they needed... in the sunset of their lives.

1010
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:31,510
And those of us who are left behind...

1011
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:34,040
to grieve for you, Joseph,

1012
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:38,010
can only bow to the divine judgement of our Lord,

1013
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:41,620
who has chosen to take you away from us...

1014
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:45,220
in this cruel accident.

1015
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:48,820
Oh, how great the holiness of our God.

1016
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:51,790
For He knoweth all things.

1017
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:55,600
And there is not anything save He knows it.

1018
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:58,500
And He cometh into the world...

1019
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:04,310
that He may save all men if they will harken unto His voice.

1020
01:27:04,310 --> 01:27:08,410
For behold, He suffered that the pains of all men.

1021
01:27:08,410 --> 01:27:12,280
Yea, the pains of every living creature,

1022
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:15,080
both men, women and children...

1023
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,400
Can't you leave me alone?

1024
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,740
Isn't it enough that you killed him?

1025
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:37,440
That's not so, Mrs. Maloney. It was the other way.

1026
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:40,440
You. You started it all coming here...

1027
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:43,150
and messing in things that were none of your business.

1028
01:27:43,150 --> 01:27:45,750
Now go away. Please!

1029
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:48,250
- Mrs. Maloney, I have to talk to you.  - He's dead and buried.

1030
01:27:48,250 --> 01:27:50,390
- There's nothing to talk about.  - Why didn't he want me...

1031
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:53,160
- Iooking for Eddie Shoebridge?  - I am not listening to you.

1032
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:55,820
- Get away from me!  - Mrs. Maloney, your husband tried to kill me,

1033
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:58,030
- and you were in on it, werert you?  - No.

1034
01:27:58,030 --> 01:28:01,930
- Then why are you always running away from me? Is that why?  - No.

1035
01:28:01,930 --> 01:28:05,670
Do you realize that you are an accessory to an attempted murder?

1036
01:28:05,670 --> 01:28:10,110
- I had nothing to do with that.  - Perhaps the police would think that you did.

1037
01:28:10,110 --> 01:28:13,940
- You want me to go to the police about it?  - For God's sake.

1038
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:18,910
- You wouldn't do that...  - Just tell me where is Eddie Shoebridge?

1039
01:28:18,910 --> 01:28:23,820
- I can't.  - Mrs. Maloney, where is he? Please tell me.

1040
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:29,830
There is no Eddie Shoebridge.

1041
01:28:29,830 --> 01:28:34,960
He went up in smoke 25 years ago and came down in the city.

1042
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:39,300
He calls himself Arthur Adamson.

1043
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:41,740
Arthur Adamson?

1044
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:46,980
If he finds out I told you, he'll kill me.

1045
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:51,670
Now go away, and don't ever come near me again.

1046
01:28:54,850 --> 01:28:58,580
Fake! Fake!

1047
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:14,770
Wait a second, now. You're the one that's exaggerating.

1048
01:29:14,770 --> 01:29:18,510
No, I'll give you two or three days maybe I missed, but never more than that.

1049
01:29:18,510 --> 01:29:21,880
- Tell him it's deeply important.  - Shh!

1050
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:24,480
- Stand up.  - Why me?

1051
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,650
What makes you think that it's me that ran up all the extra mileage?

1052
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:32,950
What about that little asshole, Herbie, or, uh, Al, the one on the day shift?

1053
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:36,560
I understand. I'll be there.

1054
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:39,080
Yes, I promise I'll be there.

1055
01:29:42,530 --> 01:29:44,570
The answer's no.

1056
01:29:44,570 --> 01:29:48,140
He says I must work the shift, and I must work it tonight.

1057
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:50,440
And do me a favor, Blanche.

1058
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:52,870
Please don't give me a hard time.

1059
01:29:52,870 --> 01:29:54,980
You didn't put up much of a fight.

1060
01:29:54,980 --> 01:29:58,780
Honey, look. After all the goofir off I've been doir on your behalf,

1061
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:03,650
I'm within a gnat's eyelash of losir my cab and gettir kicked right out of the company.

1062
01:30:03,650 --> 01:30:06,490
Lumley, you're thick! You won't have to drive a cab...

1063
01:30:06,490 --> 01:30:09,560
if you can get this thing over and done with and collect the money.

1064
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,960
"If," darling. You're always givir me ifs.

1065
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:13,960
I can't eat ifs and neither can you,

1066
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:17,130
while Julia Rainbird and you are waltzir around in the great beyond.

1067
01:30:17,130 --> 01:30:20,370
Come on, sweetheart. The least I can do is show up for work every now and then.

1068
01:30:20,370 --> 01:30:22,640
After all, didn't I give you the guy's name?

1069
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,940
But the phone book is full of Arthur Adamsons.

1070
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:28,840
It's very simple. All you need to do is find out the right one.

1071
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,810
That's a snap. The one that's close to 40 years old...

1072
01:30:31,810 --> 01:30:33,920
and trembles a little bit at the name Eddie Shoebridge.

1073
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:36,990
- Easy. We do that tomorrow.  - Now would be much better.

1074
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:40,090
A bird in the hand, Lumley. Please. Oh, sweetheart.

1075
01:30:40,090 --> 01:30:42,290
The only bird that's gonna be in my hand...

1076
01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:44,360
and I'm very sorry to say this...

1077
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:47,160
is a steering wheel from 4:00 to midnight.

1078
01:30:48,230 --> 01:30:51,200
Sure. Why should I get a kiss?

1079
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:53,800
Just when I was beginning to think you werert impossible.

1080
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,800
Maybe I'll do it without you.

1081
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,940
The hell you will!

1082
01:30:57,940 --> 01:30:59,940
Come on, now. Please.

1083
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:03,140
This Shoebridge fellow's gone to a lot of trouble not to be found.

1084
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:06,510
Now you got no idea what kind of trouble you could get into.

1085
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:09,080
Whatever it is, he'll forget about it...

1086
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:11,550
when he hears about the millions he's coming into.

1087
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:13,760
Oh, Blanche, come on.

1088
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:18,160
Just sit down on your pretty little... behind.

1089
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:20,560
And I must say, it is quite an...

1090
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:23,100
No, it is. Very attractive little behind.

1091
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:25,270
Just wait for me, okay?

1092
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:29,970
And tonight when I get home, we will, uh...

1093
01:31:29,970 --> 01:31:33,510
Right. Very nice. Plot our strategy.

1094
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:36,070
Know what I mean, darlir?

1095
01:31:50,990 --> 01:31:53,430
Who needs him.

1096
01:32:03,870 --> 01:32:07,010
You wouldn't be Arthur Adamson, would you?

1097
01:32:07,010 --> 01:32:09,440
Excuse me.

1098
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:16,850
Excuse me!

1099
01:32:19,190 --> 01:32:22,220
Hello. Are you Arthur Adamson?

1100
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:24,660
Hey, Art!

1101
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:28,430
Yeah?

1102
01:32:53,190 --> 01:32:55,190
I'm sorry. We're just closing.

1103
01:32:55,190 --> 01:32:59,660
I understand. I'm not shopping. Is Mr. Adamson around?

1104
01:32:59,660 --> 01:33:04,430
- I'm afraid not. But if you come back tomorrow...  - All right.

1105
01:33:04,430 --> 01:33:07,040
But just to be sure I have the right Mr. Adamson,

1106
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:11,670
- he is a gentleman of about 40, I trust?  - Yes, that's about right.

1107
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:14,840
Oh, that's the first encouraging news I've had all afternoon.

1108
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:17,710
Isn't there someplace I might reach him without delay?

1109
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:19,710
- You mean tonight?  - Yes.

1110
01:33:19,710 --> 01:33:23,020
Well, he usually goes directly home from here.

1111
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:26,550
But tonight would be very bad because I believe he's giving a party.

1112
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:29,790
I know he left unusually early for some such reason.

1113
01:33:29,790 --> 01:33:32,490
Isn't there something I can tell him for you in the morning?

1114
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:36,130
- This is personal. Rather personal.  - Oh, I see.

1115
01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:39,530
Perhaps you'd like to leave him a note.

1116
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:42,200
- A note? Very good.  - Yes. Come this way.

1117
01:33:43,770 --> 01:33:46,210
Excuse me.

1118
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:50,480
Thank you.

1119
01:34:03,290 --> 01:34:05,730
Is anything the matter?

1120
01:34:05,730 --> 01:34:08,330
Uh, I was, uh, just thinking.

1121
01:34:08,330 --> 01:34:11,200
Instead of leaving this note here,

1122
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:15,440
it might be better if I sent Mr. Adamson a telegram tonight.

1123
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:18,670
- What's his address, please?  - Well, I don't...

1124
01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:22,110
It's all right. We're friends.

1125
01:34:22,110 --> 01:34:24,680
- 1001 Franklin Street.  - 1001 Franklin.

1126
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:27,940
Thank you very much. You've been very kind.

1127
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:32,690
You're a Capricorn, aren't you?

1128
01:34:32,690 --> 01:34:35,120
No, I'm a Leo.

1129
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:39,450
That's what I thought.

1130
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:56,440
- Pete, hi.  - Hello, there, Blanche, baby.

1131
01:34:56,440 --> 01:35:00,380
- Have you seen George?  - He just left a few minutes ago, but he'll be back.

1132
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:02,850
Took a party of four out to River Valley.

1133
01:35:02,850 --> 01:35:05,950
- Oh, dear. That could take all night.  - Easily. What's up?

1134
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:08,290
- Would you give him a message for me?  - Sure thing.

1135
01:35:08,290 --> 01:35:10,930
- Just tell him I found him.  - You found him?

1136
01:35:10,930 --> 01:35:15,160
- That's right. He lives at 1001 Franklin.  - 1001 Franklin.

1137
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:17,700
That's where he lives, and that's where I'm going now.

1138
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:20,440
You found him, and that's where he lives, and that's where you're going now.

1139
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:22,930
- Thanks, Pete.  - Any time, Blanche.

1140
01:35:32,350 --> 01:35:35,150
You wanna go over the new pickup spot once again?

1141
01:35:35,150 --> 01:35:37,420
I know it by heart.

1142
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:40,820
Are you all right?

1143
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:43,760
- I will be.  - You sure?

1144
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:51,030
Have to be there at 9:30. Let's get going.

1145
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:31,040
Bishop Wood, it's time to go.

1146
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:33,270
Have you your vestments on?

1147
01:36:33,270 --> 01:36:36,740
Yes, but I haven't finished the chicken.

1148
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:41,550
I'm sorry, Your Excellency.

1149
01:36:41,550 --> 01:36:43,750
Here's what I want you to do.

1150
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:46,090
Place the armchair in the center of the room...

1151
01:36:46,090 --> 01:36:50,190
facing away from the door and seat yourself in it.

1152
01:36:50,190 --> 01:36:53,800
You're going to be comfortably put to sleep.

1153
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:57,200
But it'll last only for a short while.

1154
01:36:57,200 --> 01:37:02,000
Thank you very much. You are most considerate.

1155
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,910
Let me know when you're ready.

1156
01:37:04,910 --> 01:37:08,040
By the way. I haven't quite finished that book...

1157
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:10,410
you were kind enough to let me have.

1158
01:37:10,410 --> 01:37:13,240
May I, uh, take it along?

1159
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:18,390
With our fingerprints on it? Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1160
01:37:18,390 --> 01:37:21,560
Nice try, Your Excellency.

1161
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:26,760
Thank you. Don't bother, then. I'm ready.

1162
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:29,660
All right, I'll be turning your light off now.

1163
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:58,950
We mustrt be late. See who it is, and be careful.

1164
01:38:29,420 --> 01:38:32,660
It's her. That woman. Blanche Tyler.

1165
01:38:32,660 --> 01:38:36,100
This is incredible!

1166
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:39,690
- Is that cab driver with her?  - She's alone.

1167
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:44,640
If I didn't have to make this pickup in 35 minutes...

1168
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:47,240
What are we going to do?

1169
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:49,610
Nothing!

1170
01:38:49,610 --> 01:38:52,010
Until later tonight.

1171
01:39:04,290 --> 01:39:07,130
- She's gone.  - Come on. Let's go.

1172
01:39:07,130 --> 01:39:09,560
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

1173
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:28,610
- I thought you said...  - I know.

1174
01:40:28,610 --> 01:40:32,080
- Mr. Adamson?  - Watch him.

1175
01:40:38,150 --> 01:40:42,220
Oh, Mr. Adamson. How lucky I am not to have missed you.

1176
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:45,230
- Apparently you didn't hear me at the front door.  - Apparently.

1177
01:40:45,230 --> 01:40:49,100
I am Madame Blanche Tyler, the spiritualist.

1178
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:51,430
Good evening, honey.

1179
01:40:51,430 --> 01:40:55,270
Madame Blanche, I wonder if I might suggest to you to remove your car from our driveway.

1180
01:40:55,270 --> 01:40:58,240
- We're terribly late for an appointment.  - Well, yes.

1181
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:02,780
When you hear why I've come, Mr. Adamson... Or should I say Shoebridge?

1182
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:05,050
- You won't mind being late at all.  - My dear lady,

1183
01:41:05,050 --> 01:41:07,240
- I know exactly why you've come here.  - How could you?

1184
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:10,850
- And exactly why you and your friend, that cab driver...  - You know George?

1185
01:41:10,850 --> 01:41:16,020
Have been sniffing along my trail like two eager bloodhounds these past few weeks.

1186
01:41:16,020 --> 01:41:18,330
I had no idea, Mr. Adamson.

1187
01:41:18,330 --> 01:41:21,560
- All right, Madame Blanche, you found me.  - Music to my ears.

1188
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:26,330
I'm perfectly willing to listen to your demands, whatever they might be, but not right now.

1189
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:29,400
No demands, Mr. Adamson. Oh, no, no, no!

1190
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:33,310
Hardly that. Julia Rainbird wants nothing from you...

1191
01:41:33,310 --> 01:41:38,050
but the privilege of making you heir to the entire Rainbird fortune.

1192
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:40,280
The whole, lovely millions and millions of it.

1193
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:44,890
Now if she made any demands at all, they were on me to find you.

1194
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:47,920
Through psychic means, of course.

1195
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:52,860
Let me get this straight. Is that the only reason you and your friend have been, shall we say, investigating me?

1196
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:55,530
Oh, yes. And don't think it's been easy.

1197
01:41:55,530 --> 01:41:58,970
Oh, Mr. Adamson, you've given George and me the devil's own time of it.

1198
01:41:58,970 --> 01:42:01,570
Tracing you from a foundling baby...

1199
01:42:01,570 --> 01:42:06,010
to a young boy named Shoebridge to a man named Adamson.

1200
01:42:06,010 --> 01:42:08,880
Oh, but, Mr. Adamson, here you are, : Here I am.

1201
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:12,550
It's a happy moment for us all, isn't it?

1202
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:15,480
It's the Bishop.

1203
01:42:26,290 --> 01:42:29,190
Does anyone know that you've come here?

1204
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:32,770
No one know...

1205
01:42:32,770 --> 01:42:35,640
Anyone kn-know?

1206
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:39,310
No. Not a soul.

1207
01:42:39,310 --> 01:42:42,780
Not even George soul.

1208
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:46,510
You have nothing to worry about, Mr. Adamson.

1209
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:50,150
I promise.

1210
01:42:52,350 --> 01:42:56,520
I won't breathe a word... to anyone.

1211
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:18,740
It looks like Miss Tyler needs some rest.

1212
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:26,620
Will you do as I say?

1213
01:43:43,170 --> 01:43:47,400
No. No.

1214
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:31,520
Unlock the door.

1215
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,960
Cheer up, Fran.

1216
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:44,290
Let's go get the new diamond for our chandelier.

1217
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:12,120
Wow. It's gorgeous.

1218
01:45:22,170 --> 01:45:25,140
And now for Madame Blanche.

1219
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:48,450
Oh, my God.

1220
01:51:32,310 --> 01:51:34,740
Blanche?

1221
01:51:45,690 --> 01:51:48,120
Blanche?

1222
01:51:55,130 --> 01:51:57,560
Blanche?

1223
01:52:26,860 --> 01:52:31,030
If I'm talking too much, perhaps it's because you're not talking.

1224
01:52:31,030 --> 01:52:34,330
It's my stomach, Arthur. Murder doesn't agree with it.

1225
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:36,970
You think I'm looking forward to it?

1226
01:52:36,970 --> 01:52:40,800
If Joe Maloney had been more efficient, they'd both be dead by now.

1227
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:44,340
You can have my share, Arthur.

1228
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:49,210
You can keep both diamonds all to yourself if you'll just end it.

1229
01:52:49,850 --> 01:52:52,650
I'll tell you what I'll do.

1230
01:52:52,650 --> 01:52:55,820
If you help me carry Sleeping Beauty up out of the cellar, load her into our car...

1231
01:52:55,820 --> 01:53:00,060
and drive her out to some deserted road where a suicide can take place,

1232
01:53:00,060 --> 01:53:02,890
I promise you we'll talk this thing over.

1233
01:53:03,630 --> 01:53:06,700
- Okay?  - What about the cab driver?

1234
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:11,070
If she was able to find us, I'm sure he can too.

1235
01:53:11,070 --> 01:53:15,840
- He'll walk right into our hands.  - Your hands, not mine.

1236
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:18,350
Don't you think we ought to go down and take a look at her?

1237
01:53:18,350 --> 01:53:20,510
It's been a while since we gave her that shot.

1238
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:24,280
- You do it.  - Okay.

1239
01:54:37,690 --> 01:54:40,960
You'll be happy to know she's still unconscious.

1240
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:06,080
- Blanche.  - Shh!

1241
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:37,620
I'll put this end into her exhaust pipe... and the other end in the window.

1242
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:40,780
That way, it'll look like suicide.

1243
01:56:15,020 --> 01:56:17,260
Better go and get her now.

1244
01:56:17,260 --> 01:56:20,780
I'll take her in our car. You follow in hers.

1245
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:36,070
You take hold of her feet.

1246
01:56:40,550 --> 01:56:43,950
Jesus, she's heavy.

1247
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:47,550
George!

1248
01:56:48,620 --> 01:56:51,390
Got 'em.

1249
01:56:54,390 --> 01:56:56,900
Blanche, you faked that one beautifully.

1250
01:56:56,900 --> 01:56:59,870
You are still the champ.

1251
01:56:59,870 --> 01:57:02,440
Thank you, George.

1252
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:06,060
Do you realize how much the reward is for those two?

1253
01:57:07,510 --> 01:57:09,540
Yes.

1254
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:12,230
But do you realize how much more the reward would be...

1255
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:16,190
if we could find the diamonds and turn 'em in?

1256
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:25,290
What's the matter with you?

1257
01:57:25,290 --> 01:57:27,460
I...

1258
01:57:27,460 --> 01:57:29,890
Blanche, what's the matter?

1259
01:57:40,610 --> 01:57:43,080
Blanche, what's the matter?

1260
01:57:56,590 --> 01:57:59,020
What is it?

1261
01:58:29,060 --> 01:58:31,590
Blanche, you did it!

1262
01:58:31,590 --> 01:58:34,030
You are psychic!

1263
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:38,730
- What am I doing here on the stairs?  - You're not a fake.

1264
01:58:38,730 --> 01:58:41,430
You actually found one. Look.

1265
01:58:41,430 --> 01:58:43,440
I did?

1266
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:46,410
I'll get the police on the phone and give them our good news,

1267
01:58:46,410 --> 01:58:50,070
and call Miss Rainbird and give her the bad.

1268
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:59,820
Operator, can I have the police?
