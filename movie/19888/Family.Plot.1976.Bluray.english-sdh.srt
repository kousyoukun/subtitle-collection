1
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,416
(IN AIRY VOICE)
Someone is here.

2
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,962
Not closely.

3
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,215
Not willingly.

4
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,594
I feel they're
holding back.

5
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:57,265
What's the trouble, Henry?

6
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:04,647
(IN DEEP MALE VOICE) Too many
memories, too much pain.

7
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:08,943
Too much sorrow.

8
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,700
(IN AIRY VOICE) Whoever
is there with you,

9
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,869
tell them to
speak up, Henry.

10
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,623
Tell them
to come closer.

11
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:26,502
I think I know who
it is, Madame Blanche.

12
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,589
I think I know
what's bothering her.

13
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,591
Her, is it?

14
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,509
Never you mind,
Miss Rainbird.

15
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,803
I won't have you doing
Henry's work for him.

16
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,640
Now, let's have it,
my love.

17
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:41,851
That's why
we're here tonight.

18
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,812
To help my friend
be rid of her torment.

19
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,734
She has a right to rest her weary
head on a pillow each night

20
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,237
and sleep the peaceful
sleep of the angels.

21
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,949
How did you know about
my troubled sleep?

22
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,159
Who told you?

23
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:02,455
Her nights cannot go on
like this much longer.

24
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:06,876
I never told a soul about my nightmares.
How could you...

25
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,630
Who is this person who arrives
in our presence tonight

26
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,049
but does not dare
to come close to us?

27
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:17,386
It's her.
It's my sister Harriet.

28
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,430
It must be.

29
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:24,185
(IN HENRY'S VOICE) She stays
her distance, Julia Rainbird,

30
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,355
for she does not feel your
love or your kindness yet.

31
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,609
There is selfishness
where you are.

32
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,737
I've had all
I can take from her.

33
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:38,074
Night after night,
coming into my dreams.

34
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:42,245
Whining, complaining, trying
to make me feel guilty.

35
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,540
As though I need her to
tell me right from wrong.

36
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,502
Tell her I know
what has to be done.

37
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:53,172
I've been wanting
to do it for a year.

38
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:57,593
But it is I, Julia Rainbird,
who has made the decision.

39
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:02,390
I don't need her
to goad me on!

40
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:07,061
They're making me ill with their
ugly words in my ugly dreams.

41
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:10,773
Tell her to stop it, to go
away and leave me alone.

42
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:16,112
No, no. No, no. Don't let her go.
Don't let her go away.

43
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:20,616
Harriet? Harriet,
stay with us, Harriet.

44
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,578
Your sister wants
to speak to you now

45
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,413
from the depths
of her soul.

00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:36,632
She says, "I've waited so
long to hear from you, Julia.

50
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,844
"I've been so unhappy
without you."

51
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,931
It is you, Harriet.

52
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,976
Oh, I'm so sorry.

53
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,105
I should never have
made you do it.

54
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,774
It's all past now,

55
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:57,528
but I'll do what I can
to make up for it.

56
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:01,908
If he's still alive,
I'll find your son.

57
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,912
And I'll take him in
my arms and love him

58
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,664
as if I were you,
my poor Harriet.

59
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,585
And I'll make him
one of us

60
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,964
and give him everything,
everything.

(WHISPERING) Far away.

So far, far away.

63
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,389
But I need her.
I need her help.

64
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,893
I can't do it alone.

65
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,978
You see,
I need her memory.

66
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,814
It's over 40 years ago,

67
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:37,652
and I don't know where the child
was taken or who it was given to.

68
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:42,114
I don't know where he
is now or who he is.

(IN HENRY'S VOICE) The true
measure of Julia Rainbird's love

70
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,535
lies in what
she does now

71
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,997
with your help, of course,
and mine,

72
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:53,209
and that of the dear,
departed one

73
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,795
who has drifted
so far from us.

Don't we,

00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,175
Oh, yes. Yes, I do.

I'm willing to do anything,
anything at all.

Mmm-mmm.

Not the details,

only the gist, if you
know what I mean.

the gist of it.

(CLEARS THROAT)

107
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:30,014
About 40 years ago,
you arranged

108
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:33,726
to have your sister Harriet's
baby given away without a trace.

109

And now, your bad dreams and a
troubled conscience tell you

110
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,899
to find the grown-up person,
take him into the family,

111

and bestow
your wealth on him.

Thank you.

114
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,948
And why did I force my sister
to give the child away?

115
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:52,661
I guess the kid was
illegitimate, Miss Rainbird.

116
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,083
I don't want you to think me
a puritan, Madame Blanche.

117
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,878
But 40 years ago,
an unmarried mother

118
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,506
was not the commonplace
it is nowadays.

119
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,508
And in a family
like ours,

120
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,469
a scandal had to be
covered up at all costs.

I understand.

122

And I'm still sufficiently
old-fashioned

123
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,893
and sufficiently protective
of the Rainbird name

124

to want to seek
the missing heir

in a private
and secret fashion,

126

in the newspapers.

Most wise decision,

reason for my sending for you.

only heir is out there somewhere,

his true Rainbird name.

believe that I can,

No, I'm too old
for trying.

You've no idea how refreshing
it is for a woman of my wealth

to find someone who has
so little use for money.

00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,506
At the risk of
repeating myself,

159
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,384
I hope you will not
forget that nobody,

160
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,888
absolutely no one,
should know of our search.

161
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,183
The Rainbird name
must be protected.

162
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,560
My jaw is locked.

163
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:25,648
On that note, I will say goodbye
and thank you for coming.

164
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,142
So, how'd it go?

165
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,106
I don't know. Having to do
Henry is murder on my throat.

166
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,274
Murder.

167
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,067
Yeah, yeah. I know.

168
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,403
So how did it go?

169
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,488
She's hooked,
waiting to be pulled in.

170
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,366
Another one of
your $25 sardines?

171
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,994
No. This is
a big one, George.

172
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,453
A great big whale.

173
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,706
Well, come on. Give.

174
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,874
Keep your eyes on the road.
Don't rush me.

175
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,335
Okay, Blanchie.

176
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,754
Start way up
at the top.

177
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,881
Well, it was
as simple as ABC.

178
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,883
Henry came to me from
the upper brightness,

179
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,303
whispered to me, "This woman's
been having sleep problems."

180
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:41,015
From there on, things followed
naturally, logically.

181
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,393
Aha! So I came through for you
again, didn't I, darling?

182
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,645
No. What are you
talking about, George?

183
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,897
What do you mean,
what am I talking about?

184
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,817
You know damn well
what I'm talking about.

185
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,820
All that information that I dug up
by gabbing to the local druggist

186
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,655
about how she was
driving him crazy

187
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,574
trying to get sleeping pills
without a prescription.

188
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,161
That could have been
very, very useful to me.

189
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,996
Why didn't you
tell me about that?

190
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,873
What do you mean, why didn't I tell you?
I told you.

191
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,958
You know damn well
I told you, Blanche.

192
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:12,004
No, you always think you tell
me things, and you forget to.

193
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,131
I have to go through
heaven and hell,

194
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,883
the great beyond,
with Henry.

195
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,343
Henry, my ass.

196
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,012
It was me.
It's always me.

197
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,683
Without my research, you're about
as psychic as a dry salami.

198
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,227
Nasty. Nasty, nasty.

199
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:31,106
I'm sick and tired of having you
have me by the crystal balls.

200
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,068
Leave your crystal balls
out of this, George.

201
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,694
No, let's leave Henry
out of this

202
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,072
and keep the bullshit
for your customers.

203
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,740
You're jealous of him,
aren't you?

204
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,992
Oh, please, Blanche.

205
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,371
I like your jealousy. It's
your driving that stinks.

206
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,582
Hey, look. I happen to be
an actor, not a cab driver.

207
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,752
I can play cab drivers, but I sure as
hell don't have to drive like one.

208
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,213
Well, until I can collect
from Julia Rainbird,

209
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,799
I'm afraid you're gonna have
to go on playing a cab driver.

210
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,843
Neither of us seems to be very
fond of starving to death.

211
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,261
Well, how are we
supposed to collect?

212
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,722
How much is this Rainbird
whale gonna spout up?

213
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:06,767
Also, you're gonna have to
go on playing a private eye.

214
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,186
Christ, no! I've had it
playing private eyes.

215
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,105
Christ, yes.

216
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,900
Now, George.
Stop blaspheming.

217
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,027
You wanna put the curse
on 10 big ones?

218
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,906
Now, wait a minute,
Blanche.

219
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,491
Did you say
10 big ones?

220
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:23,992
Mmm-hmm.

225

you and I could do with 10 grand?

226
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,257
Mmm-hmm. We could
even get married.

we have to do for the money?

230

I'll tell you about it
in bed, afterwards.

Aw, come on, Blanche.
Give me a hint.

All right. Find one man.
That's all.

where he is, or who he is?

Well, George,
stop yelling.

There's a possibility of one
person who might have known.

Well, who's that?

mention him to me.

I don't think he likes
the imported stuff.

313
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,686
It was probably
my veal parmesan.

314
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,021
I'm afraid
I overcooked it.

315
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,148
He likes eating in a room with a view.
That's all.

316
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,316
You know how fussy
rich people are.

317
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,945
Don't forget to
empty that out.

318
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,740
Don't you think
emptying a chemical toilet

319
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:49,576
is a little below the dignity
of a jewel collector?

320
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,536
The wages of sin, Arthur.

321
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,998
I'll do it tomorrow.

322
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,375
Never put off
till tomorrow

323
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,544
what you can
empty out tonight.

324
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,421
Bitch.

325
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,956
Arthur, what's
Amsterdam like?

326
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,334
Oh, lots of canals.

327
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,921
Lots of wizened old men
with sharp eyes

328
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,757
sitting around, cutting big
stones into little ones.

329
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,175
You'll see.

330
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:56,392
I don't know what's come over me tonight.
I'm tingling all over.

331
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,229
I told you about danger,
didn't I?

332
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,566
First,
it makes you sick.

333
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:07,862
Then when you get through it,
it makes you very, very loving.

334
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,118
Darling...

335
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,244
Hmm?

336
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,872
It was all too easy.
It's frightening.

337
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,959
Brilliant planning.

338
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,796
They don't have a
single lead to follow.

339
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,216
What about the ketamine
we stuck him with?

340
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,635
Well, if Dr. Vogel didn't
miss it six months ago

341
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,972
when I had my wisdom tooth out,
he's not gonna miss it now.

342
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,266
Don't finish up in there.
Let's go to bed.

343
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,600
Tired?

344
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,978
Mmm-mmm.
Tingling all over.

345
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,982
How'd I ever let you
get me into all this?

346
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:47,902
I thought I fell in love with you because
I needed some stability in my life.

347
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,822
Well, I guess you're just
a bad judge of character.

348
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,615
Where'd you put
the diamond, dear?

349
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,367
Where everyone
can see it.

350
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,578
- You didn't.
- I did.

351
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,288
Are you gonna
tell me where?

352
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:00,206
You'll have to
torture me first.

353
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,916
Oh! (GIGGLING)

354
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,586
I intend to
in a few minutes.

355
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:13,052
Now with all due respect to the
FBI and the Bureau of Inspectors,

356
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,430
I have no time
to play games.

357
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,098
Now lest we forget,
gentlemen,

358
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:19,517
I have been away
from this desk forcibly.

359
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:21,394
I've got a lot of work
to catch up on.

360
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,772
Now how many more times are we gonna
go through this goddamn thing?

361
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,693
Until we come up with
something, Mr. Constantine.

362
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,737
That's a hell of a way
to solve a kidnapping.

363
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:34,115
Mr. Constantine, you're not
the first victim, you know.

364
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,325
There have been others.

365
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,369
All right, all right. But from me,
you'll learn absolutely nothing.

366
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,872
- You never know.
- I know.

367
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,790
All right. Floyd?

368
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,293
Now, the underground garage.

369
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:46,836
Full of cars.

370
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:48,087
Sounds?

371
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:49,339
People behind me.

372
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:50,506
Was it a man,
or was it a woman?

373
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:51,633
I don't know.

374
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:52,717
Man or woman?

375
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,594
- Man.
- Then what?

376
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,013
There was a prick
in my shoulder.

377
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:01,351
I started to turn,
and I woke up in a room.

378
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:04,979
Yes, and what did you
hear, inside or outside?

379
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,191
The room was
soundproofed.

380
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:12,904
I never heard anything except a
disembodied voice over a loudspeaker.

381
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,280
Describe it.

382
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:15,657
But I've already done that.

383
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:16,741
Again.

384
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:20,912
It was the voice of a man,
no accent.

385
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:24,082
Doctored up electronically.
Unrecognizable.

386
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,959
How many of them
were there?

387
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,752
Two, a man and a woman.

388
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,004
Why do you say that?

389
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:33,091
Because the faintest light filtered
down from the hallway above.

390
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,843
But not enough to give me a
chance to see who they were.

391
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,887
- Yes, and who did the cooking?
- She did.

392
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:38,972
Why?

393
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,140
Because a man
would not bother

394
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,935
to put the parsley on the filet of sole.
That's why.

395
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,436
How old is she?

396
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,188
Come on now. Please.

397
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:50,024
- How old is she?
- 25.

398
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:53,236
- Why?
- Why?

399
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,780
Because if a man my age is gonna
get kidnapped by a woman,

400
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,366
he wants her to be 25.
That's why.

401
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,786
Describe your return.

402
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,454
The return.

403
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:07,959
The disembodied voice tells me
to sit with my back to the door.

404
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,004
The light goes out. The door opens.
They both come in.

405
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:13,923
I feel a prick
in my left arm.

406
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:16,217
The next thing I know, I
wake up in that hospital bed

thinking up questions!

408

Thank you, Mr. Constantine.
You're doing great.

That's what you think.

Yes, Madame Blanche.

Henry, I want you to
seek Walter for us now.

I will try, Blanche.

But first, the mist
must part a little,

433

00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,848
about your background.

467
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,725
- My background?
- Mmm-hmm.

468
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,519
It's as dull
as dishwater.

469
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:57,438
I mean, what in the world would
you be wanting with that?

470
00:30:57,523 --> 00:31:01,734
Well, let's just say that the
information that I'm interested in

471
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,362
could be worth
a great deal of money.

472
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,739
- Oh, yeah? To who?
- Mmm-hmm.

473
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:10,034
Well, we'll get around to that
pleasant little subject in a minute

474
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,285
if you don't mind.

475
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,703
- Okay.
- Oh, swell.

476
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:17,166
Now, why don't we just start at
the beginning? Your parents.

477
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:19,252
Oh, they're both dead.
God rest them.

478
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,128
Your father was a
chauffeur, though, right?

479
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,297
How the heck
did you know that?

480
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:26,551
He was a chauffeur
for the Rainbird family.

481
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,469
Right again.

482
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:31,347
You'd be a hell of a
detective, Mr. McBride.

483
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,891
I don't know about that, my dear.
(CHUCKLES)

484
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:35,935
Now during this
period of time, though,

485
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:41,315
can you remember anybody being a
close friend of your father's?

486
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,819
There was a man. It was way
back when I was in school.

487
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,071
There was this guy that my
father used to drink beer with

488
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,574
and shoot pool with
down in the Village.

489
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:53,786
This Harry Shoebridge. Had a
poultry shop with his wife, Sadie.

490
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:56,789
Shoebridge.

491
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:57,915
Yeah.

492
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,625
His business
was always lousy,

493
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,377
even when times
were good.

494
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,421
And she used to
have miscarriages

495
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,548
like other women
have birthdays.

496
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,677
Well, they stopped trying, and
they moved away to Barlow Creek

497
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,513
and adopted a kid,
I think.

498
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:13,806
A boy?

499
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,099
Yeah, an infant.

500
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:19,061
But, you know,
I'm not so sure.

501
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:23,024
It's all kind of hazy, and I
keep connecting it with...

502
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,321
Well, I remember
this night

503
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:32,450
with my dad driving over there
to the Shoebridge's all alone,

504
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,493
and then getting in
a big fight with Ma,

505
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,495
because he'd come
home at 4:00 a.m.,

506
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,165
and he wouldn't tell her what
he was doing or something.

507
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:43,169
Now after my dad passed
away, God rest his soul,

508
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,672
my ma was damn mad
at the Shoebridges,

509
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:49,467
because they never
showed up at the funeral.

510
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,469
Then she found out why.

511
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,305
Why?

512
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,725
A year earlier, they'd
gone to their own funeral.

513
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,560
Dead?

514
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,563
Their house burned
down with them in it.

515
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:03,814
Well, what about the son?

516
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,233
Mrs. Hannagan, can't you see that
there are customers waiting?

517
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,902
Oh, yes. Yes.
I'll be right there.

518
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,737
She'll be right there,
ma'am.

519
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:14,825
Look, Mr. McBride, about all
this being worth something...

520
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,827
WOMAN:
Mrs. Hannagan!

521
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:19,205
- Yeah.
- (SIGHS) Wait a second.

522
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:22,583
This Shoebridge son,
where do I look for him?

523
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,835
Well, try the
Barlow Creek Cemetery.

524
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,837
What do you mean,
the cemetery?

525
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:30,174
Well, I'm not sure,
but I think he's dead, too.

526
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:12,943
Sorry.

527
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,081
(SIGHS)

528
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,047
Dead end, Blanche.

529
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,716
Dead and buried.

530
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:01,826
Caretaker.
Do something for you?

531
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,577
I'm just a friend
of the family.

532
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,875
None left.
Bad business, that.

533
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,795
You mean the fire?

534
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,091
Never liked them
multiple funerals.

535
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,635
Too much work involved
all at one time.

536
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,430
They died together,

537
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,684
yet they're not buried
together in the same hole.

538
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,269
How come?

539
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,105
Search me.

540
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,192
Here. Look.

541
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:49,415
Died 1950.

542
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,543
Died 1950.

543
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,962
Both died the same date.

544
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,593
Old stone.

545
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,303
This is
a practically new stone.

546
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,016
Smart fellow, ain't ya?

547
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,475
Why? Have I stumbled on
to something?

548
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,063
Well, nice meeting you.

549
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:18,027
Better get back to my work. I got
a job coming in here tomorrow.

550
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,242
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

551
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:39,089
Turn that damn
thing down, Marcella.

552
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,425
I can't even
hear myself think.

553
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,388
How do you expect me to remember
anything that far back?

554
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:49,642
I'd have to go through my old files
for that kind of information.

555
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:52,353
Well, Mr. Wheeler,
I hate to insist.

556
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,856
You know something,
Mr. McBride?

557
00:37:55,941 --> 00:38:00,069
You lawyers are all alike.
Trouble, trouble, trouble.

558
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,031
Well, come on.
I don't have all day.

559
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,951
What year did you say
the family died?

560
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,869
Uh, 1950.

561
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,247
What month?

562
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,292
Oh, I can't
help you there.

563
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:16,835
Shoebridge.

564
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,671
- Can I sit down here?
- Sure. Yeah, go ahead.

565
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:22,049
Shoebridge.
Shoebridge.

566
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:23,592

570
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,106
What about the son?

571
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,651
Edward Shoebridge.
He's their son.

572
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,236
Edward?

573
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,696
Yeah.

574
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,364
Nope. Nothing.

575
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,991
What do you mean,
nothing?

576
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:49,660
There's gotta be something.
Maybe it came later.

577
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,954
Wait a minute. You're talking
about Eddie Shoebridge.

578
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,623
His headstone? Yeah,
that did come later.

579
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:57,751
I think in '65.

580
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,212
Sure, I remember that kid.

581
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,423
He wasn't too popular
around here.

582
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,341
Some say he set
that fire himself,

583
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:06,010
you know,
to get rid of his family,

584
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:09,346
and then disappeared to make it
look like he died in the fire, too.

585
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:11,515
They never did
find his body.

586
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,642
You mean, there's
no body in that grave?

587
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:15,060
Well, as I recollect,

588
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:18,022
that's why the local parson wouldn't
say any services for Eddie.

589
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:21,108
Well, (CLEARS THROAT) wasn't
there a death certificate?

590
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:25,487
I wouldn't know about that,
and I don't need to know.

591
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:28,032
I'm just a businessman,
Mr. McBride.

592
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:35,831
Ah, here it is. "Edward Shoebridge.

It's paid in cash.

They don't
usually do that.

597
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,931
- Who was it?
- I don't know, Mr. McBride.

598
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,808
I guess he didn't
want his name known.

599
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:58,645
Well, what do
you mean, "he?"

600
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,606
You just said "he."

601
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,900
I did, didn't I?

602
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:10,074
Well, you know, I seem to sort
of remember that it was a man.

603
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,868
Yeah. A young fella.

604
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,995
Slightly bald.

605
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:18,665
I'd say
in his late 20s.

606
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,878
And did you see him again when
you put in the headstone?

607
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,755
We didn't do that.

608
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,257
He came by and
picked it up himself.

609
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:29,009
Yes, I remember now.

No, there is no death certificate

Well, there is this.

- you could make yourself some money.
- Yeah?

Matter of fact, I think
that Eddie Shoebridge

he ain't gonna be hearing

have to tell him, huh?

What headstone?

You owe me $2.47, mister.

went to the county courthouse

death for Edward Shoebridge,

No doubt you've been
reading or hearing

777
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,536
about the
Constantine kidnapping.

778
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,580
Well, I have a confession
to make, Inspector.

779
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:26,791
When I heard of the size of
that stone, my mouth watered.

780
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:28,543
Professionally speaking,
of course.

781
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:29,753
(CHUCKLES)

782
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:33,214
Well, just so you don't feel
discriminated against, Mr. Adamson,

783
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:37,594
we're routinely covering every gem
dealer and jewelry store in the city.

784
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:39,679
Well, I'm flattered.

785
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:43,433
Have you,
by any chance,

786
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,685
noticed anything out of the
ordinary, Mr. Adamson?

787
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:49,731
Any unusual movement
of large or small stones

788
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,274
into the markets
these last few days?

789
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,026
Absolutely not.

790
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,360
I see.

791
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:56,237
I take it then that you're
going on the assumption

792
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:59,407
that this ransom stone has
been cut up into smaller gems?

793
00:51:59,492 --> 00:52:00,784
That's correct, sir.

794
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,619
It makes
a lot of sense.

795
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:04,537
We think so.

796
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:07,916
If I may presume to make a
suggestion, it seems to me

797
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,503
you gentlemen ought to be covering the
antique and secondhand jewelry markets.

798
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:13,004
They buy from anyone.

799
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:16,716
Whereas we jewelers buy exclusively
on the wholesale exchanges.

800
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,969
- That's already being done, Mr. Adamson.
- Oh.

801
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:23,640
I think we've taken up enough
of Mr. Adamson's time.

802
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:26,935
Well, I'm sorry I haven't been able
to be of more help to you, gentlemen.

803
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:31,481
However, if I do hear of any unusual
transactions in the marketplace,

804
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,024
I'll be sure
and contact you.

805
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:36,277
Yes, we'd appreciate that.
Much obliged.

806
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:37,403
Take care.

807
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:38,613
Goodbye, sir.

808
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,698
Good day.
And good luck.

809
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,509
Mrs. Clay, close up
as soon as you wish.

810
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:00,844
I have some work
to do in here,

811
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:03,346
and I'll let myself
out the back way.

812
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,557
- Good night.
- Good night.

813
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:17,253
Your friend, Blanche
Tyler, is a spiritualist.

814
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:18,838
A spiritualist?

815
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:21,090
That's what it says
on her shingle.

816
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:23,217
Also, there's no one home.

817
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:26,346
A spirit is never at home.
Get in.

818
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:33,895
What do you think
we should do?

819
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:34,979
We'll wait.

820
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:36,773
We still don't know
who the man is yet.

821
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:37,941
Yeah.

822
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:39,609
- Must you?
- Mmm-hmm.

823
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,205
That must be her.

824
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,783
That must be the fellow with the
pipe who called on Maloney.

825
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,159
A cab driver.

826
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:32,912
Lumley. Lumley, what's this?
Where are you going?

827
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:35,748
I'm going home to my own bed
where I can get some sleep.

828
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,667
No, you're not.

829
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,670
Blanche, is that all you've
ever got on your mind?

830
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:43,089
What are you saving
it for, a rainy day?

831
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,174
Hey, honey, you never know
when you're gonna need it.

832
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:47,301
You're not being
friendly, Lumley.

833
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:51,514
Blanche, I'm too pooped to pop.
I'd be useless to you.

834
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,808
You're always useless to me!
(DOG BARKING)

835
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:57,395
You're always pooping out when
I need you most! (CAR HORN HONKING)

836
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:00,314
...so we can collect a huge sum of money.
You call that being useless?

837
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:01,733
You know what
I'm talking about.

838
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:03,526
Come on inside and
stop being difficult.

839
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,695
Not tonight, Josephine.
I'm out of here.

840
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,488
You're a fink!

841
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:09,741
If I'm a fink, honey,
you're an ungrateful bitch.

842
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:11,034
What about tomorrow?

843
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:12,160
What about it?

844
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:14,037
You've got important
work to do.

845
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:16,831
I want you to be sure
about Eddie Shoebridge.

846
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,499
See that you find him
and talk to him!

847
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:20,334
How many times are you going
to tell me that? Huh?

848
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:22,545
And how many times am I
gonna have to tell you

849
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:25,715
that tomorrow I have
to work in my cab?

850
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,216
So it'll wait
till Sunday.

851
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:48,571
You better give me a quick synopsis.
I'm confused.

852
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,990
Simple. A cab driver
is shacked up

853
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:53,326
with a sex-starved medium
named Blanche Tyler.

854
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,494
And don't ask me why,

855
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:58,164
but apparently, they're on the trail
of some spook named Eddie Shoebridge.

856
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:02,251
Fortunately, not on the trail of
your favorite kidnapper and mine.

857
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:04,170
How can you
be so sure?

858
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:07,256
You did hear him talk about
collecting a huge hunk of money.

859
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:10,051
Couldn't that be the reward
that's on our heads?

860
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,678
You got yourself a point
there, Frances, old girl.

861
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:15,765
And only time will tell
whether it's any good.

862
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,517
One thing's certain.

863
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:21,437
We're not going to change
our game plan. Not now.

864
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,774
Buy me a drink, Arthur.

865
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:29,904
A shiny car.
A limousine?

866
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:33,533
Why does he drive
so fast, Henry?

867
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:36,619
What's that on the seat
beside him?

868
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:39,455
I hear the sound
of a baby crying.

869
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:43,084
Quick, Henry, before he
disappears from view, ask...

870
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,378
Yes, I know.

871
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:50,007
I see him now.

872
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:53,928
The uniform.
A chauffeur.

873
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,556
Words.
Henry, I need words.

874
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,474
Who? The what?

875
00:57:58,559 --> 00:57:59,767
(PANTING)

876
00:57:59,852 --> 00:58:02,019
The Rainbird chauffeur?

877
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:05,648
Good heavens. Old Michael
O'Keefe, our chauffeur.

878
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:08,693
BLANCHE: (GASPS)
Where is Michael going?

879
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:12,572
Henry, ask him where he's
taking Harriet's baby.

880
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,658
Oh, more pictures are
coming in too fast.

881
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,202
I can hardly
make them out.

882
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:21,581
Henry, a graveyard,
a headstone?

883
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,958
I don't
like this, Henry.

884
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,419
A shoe. Bridge.

885
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:31,090
A shoe bridge? Oh, don't
do this to me, Henry.

886
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,426
Speak to the chauffeur.

887
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,927
Oh, God,
something's burning.

888
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:38,764
The house. Quick, Henry.
The house is on fire.

889
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,392
Well, take me
away from here.

890
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,311
I don't want
to see this.

891
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:47,064
I can't bear the sound
of their awful screaming.

892
00:58:47,149 --> 00:58:48,691
Go back to
the chauffeur, Henry.

893
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,276
Get Michael
into our presence.

894
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,236
Miss Rainbird
remembers him.

895
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:54,906
Yes, I remember.

896
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:57,617
And, Madame Blanche,
listen to me.

897
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,912
Can you hear me?

898
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:04,123
I've remembered
something else

899
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:06,292
that could be
terribly important.

900
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:09,837
Wait one minute, Henry,
before you go.

901
00:59:09,922 --> 00:59:14,008
Miss Rainbird deserves some kind of
assurance about Harriet's child.

902
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:18,846
He's a man by now,
and we have to know.

903
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:20,431
Is he happy, Henry?

904
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:23,643
Is he alive,
and well, and happy?

905
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:27,688
Well, if you can't,
you can't.

906
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,441
I certainly
can't force you.

907
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:34,612
Yes, of course
she'll understand.

908
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,658
Until next time then.
Goodbye.

909
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:41,077
Goodbye, my love.

910
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:45,414
What happened?

911
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:46,958
Don't you remember?

912
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:50,086
Not a blessed thing.

913
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,755
It doesn't matter now.

914
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,258
Listen, listen,
Madame Blanche.

915
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:59,929
Your Henry jogged my memory of
something I'd completely forgotten.

916
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:02,223
When our poor
old chauffeur, Mike,

917
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,225
realized that
he was dying,

918
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:08,396
he wrote to me and said there
was one person on Earth

919
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,190
who had promised that
he'd make it his business

920
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:15,444
to know where Harriet's son
was as long as he lived.

921
01:00:15,988 --> 01:00:20,324
It was the parson who
baptized the newborn baby.

922
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:23,744
And there's an additional
thing I can tell you.

923
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:27,581
Don't tell me.
Let me guess.

924
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:29,625
500.

925
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:32,128
Not a penny.
Not even 100 for expenses.

926
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:33,963
It's all or nothing,
George,

927
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:36,465
until I can produce his name
and his present address.

928
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,009
Jesus, Blanche.

929
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:40,636
However, she gave me
a marvelous clue.

930
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:41,971
Here we go again.

931
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,639
No, here you go again.

932
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:46,642
To the man who might tell you
if Shoebridge is dead or alive.

933
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:47,768
Yeah, who's that?

934
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:50,771
Bishop Wood at
St. Anselm's Cathedral.

935
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:52,440
Holy Christ, Blanche.

936
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:53,733
No, George, not him.

937
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:56,485
Bishop Wood at
St. Anselm's Cathedral.

938
01:00:56,570 --> 01:01:00,489
He was a parson once, and he
baptized the Shoebridge baby.

939
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,661
(CHOIR SINGING)

940
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,164
Excuse me.

941
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,291
(INAUDIBLE)

942
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:55,961
Sorry.

943
01:01:56,630 --> 01:02:00,883
Do you know how I could make
a date to see Bishop Wood?

944
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,718
If you want to make
the appointment today,

945
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:05,971
you'll have to make it
through the chaplain.

946
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:08,557
Which one is
the chaplain?

947
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:12,186
When the service is over,
I'll show you where to go.

948
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,502
Oh, dear.

949
01:02:36,837 --> 01:02:38,838
(CONGREGATION MURMURING)

950
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,156
The bishop,
where are they taking him?

951
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,365
I don't know.
Do you think he's sick?

952
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:22,465
You know he's moving. You
sure you gave him enough?

953
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:26,218
Just the usual dose.
He looks so harmless.

954
01:03:26,553 --> 01:03:29,346
You know, when I was a little
kid living in that village,

955
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:32,224
he always made me feel
like I was something evil.

956
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:33,851
And look at me now.

957
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:36,312
Well, I feel
years younger.

958
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:39,607
You know, one more like this one
today, and we'll be naturally gray.

959
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:41,859
It was an incredible job.

960
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:44,361
You know, I really think it's
worth more than a million.

961
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:46,614
Well, I'm sorry, darling,
but I'm not going back

962
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:49,200
and rewrite my ransom note
that I left in my prayer book.

963
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:52,369
You'll have to be a good sport
and settle for a million.

964
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,997
You were beautiful, Fran.
Just beautiful.

965
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:57,208
I was scared.

966
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:59,376
I told you it'd be
all right, didn't I?

967
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:01,670
People in church
are inhibited.

968
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:04,006
They don't jump up, and run
around, and make a lot of noise.

969
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,050
They're all too
religiously polite.

970
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:09,053
Shall we go on
congratulating ourselves,

971
01:04:09,137 --> 01:04:10,930
or would you like to
talk about him now?

972
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:12,556
Who?

973
01:04:12,641 --> 01:04:14,808
"Who." The man
with the pipe.

974
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:18,437
So you saw him
there then, huh?

975
01:04:18,522 --> 01:04:20,105
Larger than life.

976
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:22,858
Larger than death,
you mean.

977
01:04:22,943 --> 01:04:25,027
There's no doubt about
who he's after now.

978
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,363
What were you planning
to do about him, dear,

979
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:29,532
besides just not
telling me?

980
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:33,077
I'm not planning to do
anything about him.

981
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:36,539
Joe Maloney's been itching for that job.
He's got it.

982
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:40,334
I'll phone him as soon as we
put our guest in his quarters.

983
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:43,754
I was right about that
silly cab driver.

984
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:46,048
For once in my life,
I hate being right.

985
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,384
Well, how in the hell could he have
known we were going to be there

986
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:51,136
when you and I are the only two
people in the world who knew that?

987
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:54,223
(SIGHS) I've got a thought.
It's a dumb one.

988
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:55,891
Well, say it.

989
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:58,060
Do you believe in ESP,

990
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:01,397
extra sensory perception, all
that sort of psychic phenomena?

991
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:03,315
What do you mean?
Madame What's-Her-Name?

992
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:05,401
Blanche Tyler.

993
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,071
Jesus.

994
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,240
You and I know that
that's off the wall,

995
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,742
but can we afford
to be wrong?

996
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:18,163
I'm afraid our two
quarrelsome lovers

997
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:20,291
are going to have to
share a fatal accident.

998
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:22,001
Oh, my God.

999
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:25,713
But Maloney wouldn't be
willing to do that, would he?

1000
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:28,716
Of course he'd be
willing. Gladly.

1001
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:32,344
He'd believe he was protecting
himself and his old buddy.

1002
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,473
Well, I don't want
to know about it. Okay?

1003
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:38,392
Promise me, Arthur.

1004
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:39,727
Come on, now, dear.

1005
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:43,314
That's what's so exciting
about all of this.

1006
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:46,692
We move as one. Everything together.
Nothing held back.

1007
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,893
It was gross negligence,
losing him that way.

1008
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,186
He was all we had.

1009
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:25,314
I didn't lose him, Blanche.
He was kidnapped.

1010
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:30,944
Why would anyone want
to do that to a bishop?

1011
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:34,490
For the ransom, dummy.
It's a million dollars.

1012
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:41,872
I can't get over it. You
know that I was right there.

1013
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:46,210
Forget about the million.
What about our 10,000?

1014
01:06:49,089 --> 01:06:51,090
We've got nowhere
to go now, Lumley.

1015
01:06:52,384 --> 01:06:55,511
And what am I gonna
tell Miss Rainbird?

1016
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:58,806
I suppose Henry and I are going to
have to exhaust ourselves again

1017
01:06:58,890 --> 01:06:59,890
doing your work for you.

1018
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:01,016
What do you mean,
my work?

1019
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:04,603
My work is driving a goddamn
cab, for Christ's sake.

1020
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:07,231
And starting right this minute,
that's exact... (PHONE RINGING)

1021
01:07:07,315 --> 01:07:08,732
That's exact what?
Go ahead.

1022
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:10,109
Answer the telephone.

1023
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:17,574
Hello? Who?

1024
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:22,287
Mr. Maloney? Barlow Creek?
Go ahead.

1025
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:25,624
Hello.

1026
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:29,837
Can you speak a little
louder, Mr. Maloney?

1027
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:32,214
<i>I said I traced you through the
license plates on that car</i>

1028
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:34,425
<i>your lawyer friend
was driving.</i>

1029
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:37,386
<i>I figured if you was still looking
for some dope on Eddie Shoebridge,</i>

1030
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,972
<i>- I might have something for you.</i>
- Oh.

1031
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,725
How come you changed
your mind, Mr. Maloney?

1032
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:44,226
<i>I didn't say nothing
to your man,</i>

1033
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,895
<i>'cause I felt it was none of
my business and none of his,</i>

1034
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,398
<i>but I been thinking about it,
and how I could use the bread.</i>

1035
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:50,733
<i>So for a little
consideration,</i>

1036
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:52,234
<i>I'm willing to
lead you to someone</i>

1037
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:55,988
<i>who knows Eddie Shoebridge's wife.
It'll cost you a grand.</i>

1038
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,322
(LAUGHS)

1039
01:07:57,407 --> 01:08:00,075
Oh, don't be silly,
Mr. Maloney.

1040
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,869
I have my lawyer
right here beside me,

1041
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:03,746
and he says
he'll give you $100

1042
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:06,039
provided it leads
to something.

1043
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:07,541
<i>Make it two.</i>

1044
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:12,421
All right.
It's a deal.

1045
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:14,006
Where do we meet?

1046
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,132
<i>You and that
lawyer friend of yours,</i>

1047
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:18,135
<i>you drive up and meet me at
Abe & Mabel's in two hours.</i>

1048
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,762
Abe & Mabel's?

1049
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:22,681
<i>Yes, it's a cafe up the road to Mt.
Sherman,</i>

1050
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:25,559
<i>about five miles up
off Route 22.</i>

1051
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:27,770
<i>- You know where it is?</i>
- Yeah. Why so far away?

1052
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:30,105
Can't we meet somewhere
more convenient?

1053
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:33,776
<i>Well, this party I'm gonna take you
to happens to be up in that area.</i>

1054
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:34,860
I see.

1055
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:37,946
Mr. Maloney, are you admitting
Edward Shoebridge is still alive?

1056
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:40,282
<i>I ain't saying a thing till I
see the color of your money.</i>

1057
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,201
<i>In two hours.</i>

1058
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:45,954
What do you think?

1059
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:47,247
Smells fishy to me.

1060
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:48,791
I know.

1061
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:52,586
But even fish smells good when
you're starving to death.

1062
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:55,047
What do we have to lose?
He's the only clue left.

1063
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:57,758
You got $200 on you?

1064
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:02,095
You know me better than that.
Of course not.

1065
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:05,224
Fix me
another one of these.

1066
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,143
You don't need another one.
You already got one.

1067
01:09:08,228 --> 01:09:09,728
We only got two hours
to get there.

1068
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:12,064
- I'll eat in the car.
- Come on.

1069
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:14,691
You're impossible.

1070
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:50,704
A couple of beers, please.

1071
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:57,502
He must be late.

1072
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:23,528
Thank you, dear.

1073
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:38,043
You kids
sit over there.

1074
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:47,886
Well, how was
Sunday school today?

1075
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:49,054
Noisy.

1076
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:50,305
Five Cokes, please.

1077
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:51,807
We didn't make
any noise.

1078
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:53,725
That's right. That's
why you're here.

1079

(BOY GIGGLES)

1080
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:21,420
Don't blame me.

1081
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:23,422
Did I say anything?

1082
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:32,806
Hello.
I'm sorry I'm late.

1238
01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:25,072
And he suffereth this that the
resurrection might pass upon all men,

1239
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:28,951
that all might stand before him
at the great and judgment day.

1240
01:27:29,036 --> 01:27:31,621
Can't you
leave me alone?

1241
01:27:31,705 --> 01:27:33,748
Isn't it enough
that you killed him?

1242
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:35,625
No, that's not so,
Mrs. Maloney.

1243
01:27:35,709 --> 01:27:37,585
It was the other way.

1244
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:40,588
You. You started
it all coming here

1245
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:43,299
and messing in things that
were none of your business.

1246
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:45,509
Now go away. Please!

1247
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:47,178
Mrs. Maloney,
I have to talk to you.

1248
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:49,472
He's dead and buried. There's
nothing to talk about.

1249
01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:51,599
Why didn't he want me looking
for Eddie Shoebridge?

1250
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:54,185
I am not listening to you.
Get away from me!

1251
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:55,770
Mrs. Maloney, your husband
tried to kill me,

1252
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:57,146
and you were in on it,
weren't you?

1253
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:58,272
No.

1254
01:27:58,357 --> 01:28:00,775
Well, then why are you always
running away from me? Is that why?

1255
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:02,443
No.

1256
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:05,821
Do you realize that you are an
accessory to an attempted murder?

1257
01:28:05,906 --> 01:28:07,573
I had nothing to do with that.
I don't know what you...

1258
01:28:07,658 --> 01:28:10,409
Perhaps the police would think that
you did have something to do with it.

1259
01:28:10,494 --> 01:28:12,453
You want me to go to
the police about it?

1260
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:14,538
For God's sake.
You wouldn't do that.

1261
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:17,792
Look, just tell me.
Where is Eddie Shoebridge?

1262
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:20,169
I can't.

1263
01:28:20,253 --> 01:28:23,464
Mrs. Maloney, where is he?
Please tell me.

1264
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:28,970
There is no
Eddie Shoebridge.

1265
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:35,017
He went up in smoke 25 years
ago and came down in the city.

1266
01:28:35,102 --> 01:28:38,062
He calls himself
Arthur Adamson.

1267
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:41,148
Arthur Adamson?

1268
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:46,988
If he finds out I told
you, he'll kill me.

1269
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:51,242
Now, go away and don't
ever come near me again.

1270
01:28:54,913 --> 01:28:57,248
Fake! Fake!

1271
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:14,849
Well, wait a second now. You're
the one that's exaggerating.

1272
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:17,351
No, no, now, I'll give you two
or three days maybe I missed,

1273
01:29:17,436 --> 01:29:18,519
but never
more than that.

1274
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:20,521
Tell him
it's deeply important.

1275
01:29:21,231 --> 01:29:23,107
Go on. Stand up.

1276
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:27,778
Why me? What makes you think that it's
me that ran up all the extra mileage?

1277
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:29,613
What about that
little asshole Herbie,

1278
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:32,199
or Al, the one
on the day shift?

1279
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:37,079
I understand.
I'll be there.

1280
01:29:37,164 --> 01:29:39,457
Yes, I promise
I'll be there.

1281
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:44,879
The answer's no.

1282
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:48,049
He says I must work the shift,
and I must work it tonight.

1283
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:50,468
And do me a favor,
Blanche.

1284
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:52,511
Please don't give me
a hard time.

1285
01:29:53,263 --> 01:29:55,222
You didn't put up
much of a fight.

1286
01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:58,893
Hey, honey, look, after all the goofing
off I've been doing on your behalf,

1287
01:29:58,977 --> 01:30:01,270
I'm within a gnat's
eyelash of losing my cab

1288
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:03,189
and getting kicked
right out of the company.

1289
01:30:03,273 --> 01:30:06,525
Lumley, you're thick! You
won't have to drive a cab

1290
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:09,612
if we can get this thing over and
done with and collect the money.

1291
01:30:09,696 --> 01:30:12,073
If, darling, if. You're
always giving me ifs.

1292
01:30:12,157 --> 01:30:13,949
I can't eat ifs
and neither can you

1293
01:30:14,034 --> 01:30:17,244
while Julia Rainbird and you are
waltzing around in the great beyond.

1294
01:30:17,329 --> 01:30:18,287
I mean,
come on, sweetheart.

1295
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:20,414
The least I can do is show up
for work every now and then.

1296
01:30:20,499 --> 01:30:22,625
After all, didn't I give
you the guy's name?

1297
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:24,960
Yeah, but the phone book is full
of Arthur Adamsons. Look at them.

1298
01:30:25,045 --> 01:30:28,964
It's very simple. All you need
to do is find out the right one.

1299
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:31,926
It's a snap. The one that's
close to 40 years old

1300
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:34,053
and trembles a little bit
at the name Eddie Shoebridge.

1301
01:30:34,137 --> 01:30:35,554
Easy.
We do that tomorrow.

1302
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:37,056
Now would be much better.

1303
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,600
A bird in the hand, Lumley.
Please.

1304
01:30:39,684 --> 01:30:42,353
Sweetheart, the only bird
that's gonna be in my hand,

1305
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,438
and I'm very sorry
to say this,

1306

is a steering wheel
from 4:00 to midnight.

1307
01:30:48,318 --> 01:30:50,569
Sure.
Why should I get a kiss?

1308
01:30:51,404 --> 01:30:54,615
Just when I was beginning to
think you weren't impossible.

1309
01:30:54,699 --> 01:30:55,950
Maybe I'll do it
without you.

1310
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:57,701
The hell you will!

1311
01:30:58,245 --> 01:31:00,037
Come on, now, Blanche.
Please.

1312
01:31:00,122 --> 01:31:03,124
This Shoebridge fellow's gone to a
lot of trouble not to be found.

1313
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:06,502
Now you got no idea what kind
of trouble you could get into.

1314
01:31:06,586 --> 01:31:09,130
Yeah, well, whatever it
is, he'll forget about it

1315
01:31:09,214 --> 01:31:11,549
when he hears about the
millions he's coming into.

1316
01:31:12,259 --> 01:31:17,221
Blanche, come on. Just sit down
on your pretty little behind.

1317
01:31:18,348 --> 01:31:20,641
And I must say,
it is quite an...

1318
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:23,144
No, it is. Very
attractive little behind.

1319
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:25,312
And just wait
for me, okay?

1320
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:28,858
And tonight when
I get home, we will...

1321
01:31:30,193 --> 01:31:34,738
Right. Very nice. Plot our strategy.
Know what I mean, darling?

1322
01:31:51,173 --> 01:31:52,756
Who needs him?

1323
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:00,472
(BUZZER BUZZING)

1324
01:32:03,935 --> 01:32:07,271
You wouldn't be Arthur
Adamson, would you?

1325
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:08,772
Excuse me.

1326
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:16,238
Excuse me!

1327
01:32:19,284 --> 01:32:22,286
Hello.
Are you Arthur Adamson?

1328
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:23,579
Hey, Art!

1329
01:32:26,082 --> 01:32:27,541
Yeah?

1330
01:32:32,923 --> 01:32:34,256
(DOORBELL RINGING)

1331
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:43,807
A.A.?

1332
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:55,402
I'm sorry.
We're just closing.

1333
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:59,531
I understand. I'm not shopping.
Is Mr. Adamson around?

1334
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:03,160
No, I'm afraid not. But if
you come back tomorrow...

1335
01:33:03,245 --> 01:33:07,164
All right. But just to be sure
I have the right Mr. Adamson,

1336
01:33:07,249 --> 01:33:10,125
he is a gentleman
of about 40, I trust?

1337
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:11,627
Yes, that's about right.

1338
01:33:12,045 --> 01:33:14,964
Oh, that's the first encouraging
news I've had all afternoon.

1339
01:33:15,048 --> 01:33:18,092
Now isn't there someplace I
might reach him without delay?

1340
01:33:18,176 --> 01:33:19,969
- You mean tonight?
- Yes.

1341
01:33:20,053 --> 01:33:23,180
Well, he usually goes
directly home from here.

1342
01:33:23,265 --> 01:33:26,600
But tonight would be very bad, because
I believe he's giving a party.

1343
01:33:26,685 --> 01:33:29,853
I know he left unusually
early for some such reason.

1344
01:33:29,938 --> 01:33:32,481
Isn't there something I can tell
him for you in the morning?

1345
01:33:32,565 --> 01:33:34,942
This is personal,
rather personal.

1346
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:36,068
Oh, I see.

1347
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:39,446
Perhaps you'd like
to leave him a note.

1348
01:33:39,531 --> 01:33:40,906
A note? Very good.

1349
01:33:40,991 --> 01:33:42,324
Yes. Come this way.

1350
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:45,744
Excuse me.

1351
01:33:47,747 --> 01:33:49,540
Thank you.

1352
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:04,305
Is anything
the matter?

1353
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:11,186
I was just thinking. Instead
of leaving this note here,

1354
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:15,149
it might be better if I sent
Mr. Adamson a telegram tonight.

1355
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:16,900
What's his address,
please?

1356
01:34:16,985 --> 01:34:18,319
Well, I don't...

1357
01:34:18,403 --> 01:34:20,404
It's all right.
We're friends.

1358
01:34:22,532 --> 01:34:24,658
- 1001 Franklin Street.
- 1001 Franklin.

1359
01:34:24,743 --> 01:34:27,745
Thank you very much.
You've been very kind.

1360
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:32,624
You're a Capricorn,
aren't you?

1361
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:34,668
No, I'm a Leo.

1362
01:34:36,046 --> 01:34:37,880
That's what I thought.

1363

Pete, hi.

1364
01:34:55,565 --> 01:34:56,523
Hello, there,
Blanche, baby.

1365
01:34:56,608 --> 01:34:57,691
Have you seen George?

1366
01:34:57,776 --> 01:35:00,444
Yeah, he just left a few minutes
ago, but he'll be back.

1367
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:02,863
- Took a party of four out to River Valley.
- River Valley?

1368
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:04,531
Oh, dear. That could
take all night.

1369
01:35:04,616 --> 01:35:05,908
Easily. What's up?

1370
01:35:06,034 --> 01:35:08,369
- Would you give him a message for me?
- Sure thing.

1371
01:35:08,453 --> 01:35:09,870
Just tell him
I found him.

1372
01:35:09,954 --> 01:35:10,996
You found him?

1373
01:35:11,081 --> 01:35:13,707
That's right.
He lives at 1001 Franklin.

1374
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:15,250
1001 Franklin.

1375
01:35:15,335 --> 01:35:17,795
That's where he lives, and
that's where I'm going now.

1376
01:35:17,879 --> 01:35:19,463
You found him,
and that's where he lives,

1377
01:35:19,547 --> 01:35:20,714
and that's where
you're going now.

1378
01:35:20,799 --> 01:35:23,634
- Thanks, Pete.
- Any time, Blanche.

1379
01:35:32,477 --> 01:35:35,229
You wanna go over the new
pickup spot once again?

1380
01:35:35,313 --> 01:35:37,564
I know it by heart.

1381
01:35:37,649 --> 01:35:39,066
Are you all right?

1382
01:35:40,902 --> 01:35:42,444
I will be.

1383
01:35:42,529 --> 01:35:43,821
You sure?

1384
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:50,661
Have to be there at 9:30.
Let's get going.

1385
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:30,951
Bishop Wood,
it's time to go.

1386
01:36:31,035 --> 01:36:32,661
Have you your
vestments on?

I want you to do.

Place the armchair in the center of
the room, facing away from the door,

and seat yourself in it.

comfortably put to sleep.

if I might suggest you

to remove your car
from our driveway.
