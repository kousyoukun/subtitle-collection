[Speaking In A Girlish,

Someone is here.

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,739
Not closely.

3
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:50,716
Not willingly.

4
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:54,447
I feel a holding back.

5
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:57,490
What's the trouble, Henry?

6
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:03,989
[In Deep Male Voice]
Too many memories,
too much pain.

7
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,057
Too... much... sorrow.

[In High Voice]
Whoever is there with you,

tell them
to speak up, Henry.

10
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:22,040
Tell them to come closer.

[Woman #2]
I think I know
who it is, Madame Blanche.

00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:28,922
I think I know
what's bothering her.

00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:32,755
[In High Voice]
Her, is it?
Never you mind, Miss Rainbird.

I won't have you doing
Henry's work for him.

[Moaning, Gasping]

16
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:41,190
Now, let's have it,
my love. That's why
we're here tonight.

17
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:44,135
To help my friend
be rid of her torment.

18
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:49,073
She has a right
to rest her weary head
on a pillow each night...

19
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:53,079
and sleep the peaceful
sleep of the angels.

20
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:56,310
H-How did you know
about my troubled sleep?

21
00:01:56,383 --> 00:02:01,844
Who told you?
Her nights cannot go on
like this much longer.

22
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:05,085
I-I never told a soul
about my nightmares.

How could you...
Who is this person
who arrives...

24
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:12,397
in our presence tonight,
but does not dare
to come close to us?

25
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:17,301
It's her.
It's my sister Harriet.

26
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:21,740
- It must be.
- [In Henry's Voice]
She stays her distance,

27
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:24,471
Julia Rainbird,
for she does not feel...

28
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:26,706
your love or
your kindness yet.

29
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,012
There is selfishness
where you are.

30
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,985
I've had all
I can take from her.

31
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:37,387
Night after night,
coming into my dreams.

32
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:41,656
Whining, complaining,
trying to make me feel guilty,

33
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,856
as though I need her
to tell me right from wrong.

34
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:48,925
Tell her I know
what has to be done.

35
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,460
I've been wanting
to do it for a year.

36
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:56,908
But it is I, Julia Rainbird,
who has made the decision.

[Sighing]
I don't need her
to goad me on!

They're making me ill
with their ugly words
in my ugly dreams.

Tell her to stop it,
to go away and
leave me alone.

[Stammering]
Oh, no. No, no.
Don't let her go!

Harriet, stay
with us, Harriet.

Oh, I'm so sorry!

I'll find your son.

in my arms and love him...

or who it was given to.

he is now or who he is.

[In Henry's Voice]
The true measure of
Julia Rainbird's love...

with your help,
of course, and mine,

70

We understand him.
Don't we, Miss Rainbird?

Oh, yes. Yes, I do.
I'm willing to do
anything. Anything at all.

In the end, there

Well...
[Clears Throat]

96

About 40 years ago,
you arranged to have...

00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:33,083
your sister Harriet's
baby given away
without a trace.

98
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,254
And now your bad dreams
and troubled conscience
tell you...

99
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,957
to find the grown-up
person, take him
into the family...

100
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,966
and bestow
your wealth on him.

101
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,628
Excellent.
Thank you.

102
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:47,299
And why did
I force my sister
to give the child away?

103
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:52,038
I guess the kid
was a... illegitimate,
Miss Rainbird.

104
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:56,416
I don't want you
to think me a puritan,
Madame Blanche.

105
00:06:56,483 --> 00:07:00,214
But 40 years ago,
an unmarried mother...

106
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,812
was not the commonplace
it is nowadays.

107
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,857
And in a family like ours,

108
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,792
a scandal had to be
covered up at all costs.

109
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,091
I understand.

110
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,188
And I'm still
sufficiently old-fashioned,

111
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,200
and sufficiently protective
of the Rainbird name,

112
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,202
to want to seek
the missing heir...

113
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,364
in a private
and secret fashion,

114
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,409
rather than go
to detective agencies...

115
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:25,536
and put notices
in the newspapers.

116
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:29,275
A most wise decision,
Miss Rainbird.

117
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,850
Well, now, suppose
we get to the reason...

118
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,853
for my sending for you.

119
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,515
I'm 78 years of age.

120
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:40,958
I would like
to go to my grave
with a quiet conscience.

121
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:45,487
Particularly as I know
that my only heir
is out there somewhere,

122
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:49,524
deprived by my acts
of his true Rainbird name.

123
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:52,936
Will you help me
with your powers?

124
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,174
If in your heart
you believe that I can,

125
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:01,112
then I owe it
to both of us
to try, Miss Rainbird.

126
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,172
No, I'm too old
for trying.

127
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,242
I've only time enough
left for results!

128
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,848
Find him for me, Madame Blanche.
Use your spirit-control,
your "Henry."

129
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:14,086
Get through to my sister.

130
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:18,222
Find her son,
whoever he is,
wherever he is,

131
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:21,734
and I'll pay you $10,000.

132
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:25,294
Te...

133
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,772
[Sighs]

134
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:31,402
Only if you genuinely
wish to, Miss Rainbird.

135
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:35,471
But let's
not think of this
as a payment to me.

136
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,915
There are many causes
dear to my heart,

137
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:41,385
which need
all the charity
the world can spare.

138
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,685
You've no idea
how refreshing it is
for a woman of my wealth...

139
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:47,556
to find someone
who has so little use
for money.

140
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,652
Thank you.

141
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:53,426
[Sighs]
Well, now, I regard
our arrangement as completed.

142
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,402
I... It's my bedtime.

143
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,064
I must take leave
of your delightful company.

144
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,109
This has been
a most memorable evening
for me, Miss Rainbird.

145
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:06,077
See to it that you
make it a rewarding one.

146
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,740
At the risk
of repeating myself,

147
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,749
I hope
you will not forget...

148
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,183
that nobody,
absolutely no one,

149
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,244
should know
of our search.

150
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:18,519
The Rainbird name
must be protected.

151
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:20,856
My jaw is locked.

152

Well, it was as simple

"This womars been having

That could have been
very, very useful to me.

Why didn't you
tell me about that?

I tell you? I told you.

00:23:57,203 --> 00:24:00,104
I told you about danger,
didn't I?

300
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,606
First it makes you sick.

301
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:05,974
Then, when
you get through it,
it makes you very,

302
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:08,377
very loving.

303
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:14,380
Darling, is it...
Hmm?

304
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,512
It was all too easy.
It's frightening.

305
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:21,217
[Sighs]
Brilliant planning.

306
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,557
They don't have
a single lead to follow.

307
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,555
What about the ketamine
we stuck him with?

308
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:31,296
Well, if Doctor Vogel
didn't miss it six months ago
when I had my wisdom tooth out,

309
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,304
he's not gonna
miss it now.

310
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,670
Don't finish up in there.
Let's go to bed.

311
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:39,370
Tired?
Mm-mm.
Tingling all over.

312
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:43,142
How'd I ever let you
get me into all this?

313
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:47,311
I thought I fell
in love with you because
I needed some stability.

314
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:50,253
Well, I guess you're just
a bad judge of character.

315
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,780
Where'd you put
the diamond, dear?
Where everyone can see it.

316
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,054
You didn't.
I did.

317
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:59,689
Are you gonna tell me where?
You'll have
to torture me first.

318
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:02,928
Oh!
[Giggling]
I intend to.

319
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,936
In a few minutes.

320
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:12,334
Now, with all due
respect to the F.B.I. And
the Bureau of Inspectors,

321
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:14,675
I have
no time to play games.

322
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:18,547
Now, lest we forget,
gentlemen, I have been away
from this desk forcibly.

323
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,551
I've got a lot
of work to catch up on.

324
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:24,077
Now, how many more
times we gonna go through
this goddamn thing?

325
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:27,892
Until we come up with
something, Mr. Constantine.

326
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,053
That's a hell of a way
to solve a kidnapping.

327
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:34,566
Mr. Constantine, you're not
the first victim, you know.
There have been others.

328
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:37,431
All right, all right.
But from me, you'll learn
absolutely nothing.

329
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:39,937
You never know.
I know.

330
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,132
All right.
Floyd?

331
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,608
Now.
The underground garage.

332
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:47,373
Full of cars.
Sounds?

333
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:49,607
- People, behind me.
- Was it a man,
or was it a woman?

334
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:51,616
I don't know.
Man or woman?

335
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:53,948
- Man.
- Then what?

336
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:58,012
[Grunts]
It was a prick in my shoulder.
I started to turn.

337
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,581
Eh...
And I woke up
in a room.

338
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:05,096
[Floyd]
Yes, and what did you hear?
Inside or outside?

339
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:07,394
The room was soundproofed.

340
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:12,165
I never heard anything
except a disembodied voice
of a loudspeaker.

341
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:15,071
- Describe it.
- But I've already done that.

342
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,438
Again!

343
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:20,137
It was the voice
of a man, no accent.

344
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:24,581
- Doctored up electronically.
Unrecognizable.
- How many of them were there?

345
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,084
Two. A man and a woman.

346
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:32,385
Why do you say that?
Because the faintest light
filtered down from above.

347
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:34,983
But not enough
to give me a chance
to see who they were.

348
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,221
- Yes, and who did the cooking?
- She did.

349
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:40,959
Why?
Because a man would not
bother to put the parsley...

350
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,967
on the filet of sole,
that's why.

351
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:46,402
- How old is she?
- Come on, now. Please.

352
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:49,373
How old is she?
Twenty-five.

353
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,535
- Why?
- Why?

354
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,045
Because if a man my age
is gonna get kidnapped
by a woman,

355
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,105
he wants her
to be 25, that's why.

356
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:02,716
- Describe your return.
- The return.

357
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:06,884
The disembodied voice
tells me to sit with
my back to the door.

358
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:10,258
The light goes out,
the door opens,
they both come in.

359
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:13,162
I feel a prick
in my left arm.

360
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:15,359
The next thing I know,
I wake up
in that hospital bed...

361
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:18,870
with you sitting there,
thinking up questions!

362
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:21,463
Thank you, Mr. Constantine.
You're doing great.

363
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,840
- That's what you think.
- All right, let's start
all over again.

364
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:28,379
Aw, shit!

365
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,955
[Piano Playing,
Birds Singing]

366
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:59,871
[Blanche]
Why, Henry, you have such
a beaming smile on your face.

367
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:02,209
[Blanche Playing Henry]
I smile because
I'm happy, Blanche.

368
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:05,910
It comes through you, Blanche,
from your friend, Ida Cookson.

369
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:08,681
[In Blanche's Voice]
I'm her guide, Henry.

370
00:28:08,754 --> 00:28:12,349
Friendship can be claimed only
when it cannot be denied.

371
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,359
[In Henry's Voice]
Tell Ida Cookson
we're all thankful here...

372
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,861
for the warm tranquility
in her heart.

373
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:21,764
It will grow even warmer
as she trusts in you,

374
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:26,703
and confides in you, and holds
back no secrets from you...

375
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:31,471
be they her own, or those
of her intimate friends.

376
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,205
[Blanche's Voice]
Did you hear that,
Mrs. Cookson?

377
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,213
[Mrs. Cookson]
Yes, Madame Blanche.

378
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:39,614
[Blanche]
Henry, I want you
to seek Walter for us now.

379
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:46,981
Search through
to the Double Strand
of Kindness, until...

380
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,460
my friend Ida Cookson
is joined in loving
communication...

381
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:52,656
with her dear,
departed husband.

382
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,961
[In Henry's Voice]
I will try, Blanche.

383
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:59,300
But first, the mist
must part a little,
and the veil must rise...

384
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:03,467
to let in the light
that will show us the path.

385
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:05,840
[In Blanche's Voice]
Ah, I'm ready now, Henry.

386
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:10,405
Ready! Ready to follow you,
wherever you want me to go.

387
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:13,508
Where? Where are
you taking me, Henry?

388
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,815
[Gasps]
Yes, yes, yes!
I see.

389
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:19,415
I see your hand
beckoning to me.
[Laughing]

390
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:22,892
Oh, what a lovely garden,
Henry.

391
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:25,657
My, my. Oh!

392
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:28,632
Is that...
Is that a statue there?

393
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:33,433
Oh! Could this be
Walter standing
beside the fountain?

394
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,142
[Whispering]
How can you do this to me?
I need your car keys.

395
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,144
I'm in a hurry.
[Moaning]
Oh!

396
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:42,339
Do you realize what damage
you can do my psyche,
breaking in this way?

397
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:44,541
Just give me your keys.
I need 'em.

398
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,550
[Shouting] Yes, Henry!
[Whispering] What for?

399
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,552
I've located the daughter
of the Rainbird chauffeur.

400
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,952
And I'm not going
as a cab driver.
[Shouting] Oh!

401
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:53,514
What am I supposed to do
without my car?
I don't care what you do.

402
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:56,925
Take a taxi.
Just give me the keys.
The trees are swaying!

403
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,395
And the branches part!

404
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,990
But there's no one there!
[Whispering] Here.

405
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:04,627
I see shadows falling!
The air is getting cold!

406
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:07,536
The brightness... dims.
Good-bye, Henry!

407
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:10,507
Oh!
[Chimes Tinkling]

408
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:13,477
[Gasps]
Did you find Walter?

409
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:16,810
- Where?
- In the kitchen.

410
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:20,711
I did.

411
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,817
[Chattering]

412
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,236
I wonder if I could speak
to you for a couple minutes,
Mrs. Hannagan.

413
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,999
Why, sure.
Do we know each other?

414
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:45,134
No, I'm Frank McBride,
of the law firm of Ferguson,
Ferguson & McBride,

415
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,144
and I just wondered
if you would mind...

416
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,908
answering a couple questions
about your background.

417
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:51,916
My background?
Mm-hmm.

418
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:53,918
[Chuckles]
Dull as dishwater.

419
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:56,716
I mean, what
in the world would you
be wanting with that?

420
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:59,188
Well, let's just say
that the, uh,

421
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:02,887
information that
I'm interested in could be
won'th a great deal of money.

422
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:06,124
Oh, yeah?
To who?
Mm-hmm.

423
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:10,066
Well, we'll get around
to that pleasant little subject
in a minute, if you don't mind.

424
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:12,103
Okay.
Oh, swell.

425
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:15,038
Now, why don't we just
start at the beginning?

426
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:18,304
Your parents.
Oh, they're both dead.
God rest 'em.

427
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,938
Your father was a chauffeur,
though, right?
How did you know that?

428
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:25,711
[Chuckles]
He was a chauffeur
for the Rainbird family.

429
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:30,653
Right again!
You'd be a hell of
a detective, Mr. McBride.

430
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,156
[Chuckles]
I don't know about that,
my dear.

431
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:37,218
Now, during this period
of time, though, can you
remember anybody, uh,

432
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:40,629
being a close friend
of your father's?

433
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:43,930
Uh, there was a man.
It was away back
when I was in school.

434
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:46,402
Uh, there was this guy
that my father used to
drink beer with...

435
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,837
and shoot pool with
down in the village.

436
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:53,606
This Harry Shoebridge
had a poultry shop
with his wife, Sadie.

437
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,613
[Chuckles]
Shoebridge.

438
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:58,616
Yeah.
His business
was always lousy,

439
00:31:58,684 --> 00:32:00,549
even when times
were good.

440
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:02,587
And she used to
have miscarriages...

441
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:05,088
like other women
have birthdays.

442
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:08,058
Well, they
stopped trying, and
they moved away...

443
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:11,653
to Barlow Creek,
and, uh, adopted

Name's McBride.
Frank McBride.

595
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,528
- First time I ever talked to
a lawyer didn't cost me money.
- [Chuckles]

596
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:31,261
Actually, Mr. Maloney,
by talking to me you could
make yourself some money.

597
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:35,670
- Yeah?
- I'm prepared to pay
a reasonable sum of cash,

598
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:40,700
right now,
for any information that could
lead me to Eddie Shoebridge.

599
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:43,906
Where I come from,
lawyers are usually
bad news.

600
00:44:43,982 --> 00:44:46,576
Oh, no.
Not this time.
This time they're good news.

601
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:48,585
Matter of fact, I think
that Eddie Shoebridge...

602
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:50,883
would be delighted
when he hears from me.

603
00:44:50,955 --> 00:44:53,082
What are you
gonna tell him?

604
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:56,593
Well, my client has asked me
to keep that confidential.

605
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:59,027
Who hired you
to find this guy?

606
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:04,092
- That's confidential also.
- Sure like to help you,
Mister...

607
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:06,432
Business ain't
all that good around here.

608
00:45:06,504 --> 00:45:09,803
- I think you can help me.
- Is that right?

609
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:14,311
Mm-hmm. See, people
around here have been telling me
that Eddie Shoebridge is dead.

610
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:17,177
[Sighs]
Well, if he's dead, looks like
he ain't gonna be hearir...

611
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:19,182
all that good news
you have to tell him, huh?

612
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:22,447
I think he's alive.

613
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,852
[Sighs]

614
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:26,890
Sure don't keep
this car very clean.

615
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:30,655
You want to tell me
why you put a headstone
on an empty grave, Maloney?

616
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,923
What headstone?

617
00:45:32,997 --> 00:45:38,560
The one you paid $395 for
back in 1965.

618
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:42,835
You owe me $2.47, mister.

619
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:45,637
Two weeks before that, you went
to the county courthouse...

620
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:48,770
and asked for a certificate
of death for Edward Shoebridge,

621
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,837
and you were turned down.

622
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:57,054
You wanna give me
your credit card?
No.

623
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,851
Credit cards are out.

624
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:10,232
Like you,
I prefer to pay...
in cash.

625
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:14,600
[Engine Starting]

626
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,401
[Car Leaving]
[Bell Dinging]

627
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,550
Now, this one happens
to be my personal favorite.

628
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:36,192
Isn't it exquisite?

629
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:39,058
[Woman]
Probably too expensive
for me.

630
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,792
[Bell Dings]
[Woman #2]
Can I help you, sir?

631
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:52,572
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
Uh, Mrs. Clay?

632
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,168
Would you take care
of Mrs. Cunningham
for a few moments?

633
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:57,476
Certainly, Mr. Adamson.

634
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:02,519
[Mrs. Cunningham]
I'm afraid I rather like it.

635
00:47:04,422 --> 00:47:07,448
[Joe]
Hey, Eddie.
You old son of a bitch.

636
00:47:07,525 --> 00:47:09,823
If it's all the same to you,
I prefer Arthur Adamson.

637
00:47:09,894 --> 00:47:12,954
Now what in the hell
are you doing here?

638
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:16,227
Had to see you about
something kind of urgent.
That's all, Eddie... Arthur.

639
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:20,031
- Couldrt you have phoned me?
- Some things you don't
put on no telephone.

640
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:22,868
Hey, uh, you got
any booze around?

641
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:29,038
[Bottle Clinking,
Top Unscrewing]

642
00:47:31,082 --> 00:47:33,744
All right, Joseph.
What is it this time?

643
00:47:33,818 --> 00:47:37,413
[Pouring Drink]
New freezer
for your wife?

644
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:41,356
Mother needs another operation?
Bookies threatened
to kill you? What?

645
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:44,189
Aw, come on, Eddie.
You make me sound
like some kind of sponger.

646
00:47:44,262 --> 00:47:46,230
Not that I ain't grateful
for all your favors.

647
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:50,393
- Did I ever have a choice?
- Okay, okay. Here it is.

648
00:47:50,468 --> 00:47:53,596
[Sniffs]
First off, I gotta
ask you a question.

649
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:58,608
- Go ahead.
- I'm tellir ya.
No shit now, Eddie.

650
00:47:58,676 --> 00:48:01,372
Can you think of any reason
why anyone would be sniffir
around in your life...

651
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:04,107
after all these years?

652
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:09,152
I can't think of
any reason at all. Why?

653
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:13,123
Well, there's this guy
comes around the garage today...

654
00:48:13,191 --> 00:48:16,456
tryir to locate
Eddie Shoebridge.

655
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:18,757
Claims he's a lawyer,
he's got good news for ya.

656
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:21,593
Wort say what,
or who he's workir for.

657
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:24,100
Calls himself McBride.
I know he's a phony
the minute I see him.

658
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:28,229
- Police?
- No way.
He's a real amateur.

659
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:31,742
I traced his license plates
with the bureau...

660
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:34,073
Doesrt even drive
his own car.

661
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,408
"Blanche Tyler,
17 Castle Heights Road."

662
00:48:42,186 --> 00:48:46,486
- What did he look like?
- [Coughs]
He's tall, thin, about 35.

663
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:48,923
He's always got
a pipe on. Asking a lot
of smart-ass questions.

664
00:48:51,162 --> 00:48:54,757
- What'd you tell him?
- Nothir. Not a goddamn thing.

665
00:48:54,832 --> 00:48:56,766
I didn't have to.
He knew everything...

666
00:48:56,834 --> 00:48:59,098
fake headstone
you had me put up,

667
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:02,037
how I tried to get you
officially declared dead.

668
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:04,506
The son of a bitch says
he thinks you're still alive.

669
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:07,339
He's lookir for you,
Eddie.

670
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:10,073
And any son of a bitch
who's lookir for you...

671
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:12,274
is lookir for me.

672
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,622
Well,

673
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:23,285
whatever he's up to,
he won't find me.

674
00:49:23,361 --> 00:49:26,023
You worry
too much, Joseph.

675
00:49:26,097 --> 00:49:29,294
Yeah, I worry too much, because
you only planned the fire,

676
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:32,268
and locked your old man
and old lady in the bedroom.

677
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:36,864
I poured the gasoline.
I lit the rags.
And I thank you.

678
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:40,707
The happiest day of
my whole, inglorious childhood.

679
00:49:40,778 --> 00:49:44,214
All right,
you want to kid about it,
it's all right with me.

680
00:49:44,282 --> 00:49:47,877
- I'm gonna track this guy down.
- And then what?

681
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,154
This.

682
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:58,019
- You'll never change, will you?
- You got no cause to complain.

683
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:03,226
- When you needed me, I was
always there, wasrt I?
- Look, put that thing away.

684
00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:06,862
And listen to me.
I want you to go back
to Barlow Creek.

685
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:08,871
Do nothing, say nothing.

686
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:12,204
Let me look into this matter
in my own, quiet way.

687
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:16,740
And if I need you for anything,
I'll contact you.

688
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:21,244
Okay?

689
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,084
[Folding Knife]

690
00:50:25,156 --> 00:50:27,215
You're the boss, Arthur.

691
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:31,125
Isn't it touching how...
a perfect murder...

692
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:33,891
has kept our friendship
alive all these years?

693
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:37,430
You better believe it.
[Knocking At Door]

694
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:41,096
- [Door Opens]
- I'm sorry to disturb you,
Mr. Adamson.

695
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:44,198
There are two gentlemen
here to see you,
from the police department.

696
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:49,072
Tell them I'll be right out.

697
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:51,239
[Door Closes]
Jesus Christ, Eddie!

698
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:53,249
[Softly]
Wait here.

699
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:10,732
Arthur Adamson. What can
I do for you gentlemen?
Sorry to bother you.

700
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:14,532
Andy Bush, Bureau
of Inspectors, and this
is Lieutenant Peterson.

701
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:16,539
Hi.
My pleasure.

702
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:20,543
No doubt you've been
reading, or hearing, about
the Constantine kidnapping.

703
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:22,841
Well, I have
a confession to make,
Inspector.

704
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,939
When I heard of
the size of that stone,
my mouth watered.

705
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,712
Professionally speaking,
of course.
[Chuckles]

706
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:32,347
Well, just so you don't
feel discriminated against,
Mr. Adamson,

707
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:36,723
we're routinely covering
every gem dealer and
jewelry store in the city.

708
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:39,729
Well, I'm flattered.

709
00:51:39,797 --> 00:51:44,757
Have you, by any chance,
noticed anything out of
the ordinary, Mr. Adamson?

710
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:50,364
Any unusual movement of large...
or small... stones into the
markets these last few days?

711
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:53,376
Absolutely not.
I see.

712
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,378
I take it that you're
going on the assumption...

713
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:58,540
that this, uh,
"ransom stone" has been
cut up into smaller gems?

714
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:01,642
That's correct,
sir.
It makes a lot of sense.

715
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:03,687
We think so.

716
00:52:03,754 --> 00:52:06,245
If I may presume
to make a suggestion,

717
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:10,657
it seems to me you ought
to be covering the antique
and secondhand jewelry markets.

718
00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:15,859
They buy from anyone, whereas
we jewelers buy exclusively
on the wholesale exchanges.

719
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:19,096
That's already being done,
Mr. Adamson.
Oh!

720
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:22,503
I think
we've taken up enough
of Mr. Adamsors time.

721
00:52:22,573 --> 00:52:25,906
Well, I'm sorry
I haven't been able to be
of more help to you.

722
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:30,606
However, if I do hear
of any unusual transactions
in the marketplace,

723
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:32,615
I'll be sure
and contact you.

724
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:36,551
Yes, we'd appreciate that.
Much obliged.
Take care.

725
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:39,612
Good-bye, sir.
Good day.
And good luck!

726
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,201
Mrs. Clay, close up as
soon as you wish. I have
some work to do in here.

727
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:02,472
I'll let myself out
the back way.

728
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:04,480
Good night.
Good night.

729
00:54:13,551 --> 00:54:17,885
Your friend, Blanche Tyler,
is a spiritualist.
A spiritualist?

730
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:22,255
That's what it says
on her shingle. Also,
there's no one home.

731
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:25,352
A spirit is never at home.
Get in.

732
00:54:30,701 --> 00:54:33,135
[Sighs]
What do you think
we should do?

733
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:37,071
We'll wait. We still don't
know who the man is yet.

734
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:39,075
Must you?
Mm-hmm.

735
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,454
That must be her.

736
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:27,282
That must be
the fellow with the pipe
who called on Maloney.

737
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:29,292
A cab driver.

738
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,022
Lumley. Lumley,

the right Mr. Adamson,

1185
01:33:06,181 --> 01:33:10,743
he is a gentleman
of about 40, I trust?
Yes, that's about right.

1186
01:33:10,819 --> 01:33:13,913
Oh, that's
the first encouraging news
I've had all afternoon.

1187
01:33:13,989 --> 01:33:16,787
Isn't there someplace
I might reach him
without delay?

1188
01:33:16,858 --> 01:33:18,792
You mean tonight?
Yes.

1189
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:22,091
Well, he usually goes
directly home from here.

1190
01:33:22,163 --> 01:33:25,621
But tonight would be
very bad because I believe
he's giving a party.

1191
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:28,863
I know he left unusually
early for some such reason.

1192
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:31,565
Isn't there something
I can tell him for you
in the morning?

1193
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:35,201
This is personal.
Rather personal.
Oh, I see.

1194
01:33:35,277 --> 01:33:38,610
Perhaps you'd like
to leave him a note.

1195
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,841
A note? Very good.
Yes. Come this way.

1196
01:33:42,918 --> 01:33:44,852
Excuse me.

1197
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:49,122
Thank you.

1198
01:34:02,437 --> 01:34:04,803
Is anything the matter?

1199
01:34:04,873 --> 01:34:07,398
Uh, I was, uh,
just thinking.

1200
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:10,273
Instead of leaving
this note here,

1201
01:34:10,345 --> 01:34:14,509
it might be better
if I sent Mr. Adamson
a telegram tonight.

1202
01:34:14,582 --> 01:34:17,745
What's his address,
please?
Well, I don't...

1203
01:34:17,819 --> 01:34:21,186
It's all right.
We're friends.

1204
01:34:21,256 --> 01:34:23,747
- 1001 Franklin Street.
- 1001 Franklin.

1205
01:34:23,825 --> 01:34:26,589
Thank you very much.
You've been very kind.

1206
01:34:29,631 --> 01:34:31,758
You're a Capricorn,
aren't you?

1207
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:33,767
No, I'm a Leo.

1208
01:34:35,103 --> 01:34:38,095
That's what I thought.

1209
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:55,512
Pete, hi.
Hello, there,
Blanche, baby.

1210
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:59,458
Have you seen George?
He just left a few minutes ago,
but he'll be back.

1211
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:01,927
Took a party of four
out to River Valley.

1212
01:35:01,997 --> 01:35:05,023
Oh, dear. That could
take all night.
Easily. What's up?

1213
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:07,364
Would you give him
a message for me?
Sure thing.

1214
01:35:07,435 --> 01:35:09,995
Just tell him
I found him.
You found him?

1215
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:14,235
That's right.
He lives at 1001 Franklin.
1001 Franklin.

1216
01:35:14,309 --> 01:35:16,777
That's where he lives,
and that's where I'm going now.

1217
01:35:16,845 --> 01:35:19,507
You found him, and
that's where he lives, and
that's where you're going now.

1218
01:35:19,581 --> 01:35:21,572
Thanks, Pete.
Any time, Blanche.

1219
01:35:31,493 --> 01:35:34,223
You wanna go over
the new pickup spot once again?

1220
01:35:34,295 --> 01:35:36,490
I know it by heart.

1221
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:39,897
Are you all right?

1222
01:35:39,968 --> 01:35:42,402
I will be.
You sure?

1223
01:35:46,241 --> 01:35:49,677
Have to be there at 9:30.
Let's get going.

1224
01:36:27,749 --> 01:36:30,115
Bishop Wood,
it's time to go.

1225
01:36:30,185 --> 01:36:32,346
Have you your vestments on?

1226
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:35,389
Yes, but I haven't
finished the chicken.

1227
01:36:37,592 --> 01:36:40,618
I'm sorry, Your Excellency.

1228
01:36:40,695 --> 01:36:42,822
Here's what
I want you to do.

1229
01:36:42,897 --> 01:36:45,161
Place the armchair
in the center of the room...

1230
01:36:45,233 --> 01:36:49,260
facing away from the door
and seat yourself in it.

1231
01:36:49,337 --> 01:36:52,864
You're going to be
comfortably put to sleep.

1232
01:36:52,941 --> 01:36:56,274
But it'll last only
for a short while.

1233
01:36:56,344 --> 01:37:01,077
Thank you very much.
You are most considerate.

1234
01:37:01,149 --> 01:37:03,982
Let me know
when you're ready.

1235
01:37:04,052 --> 01:37:07,112
By the way. I haven't quite
finished that book...

1236
01:37:07,188 --> 01:37:09,486
you were kind enough
to let me have.

1237
01:37:09,557 --> 01:37:11,889
May I, uh,
take it along?

1238
01:37:15,130 --> 01:37:17,462
With our fingerprints on it?
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1239
01:37:17,532 --> 01:37:20,626
Nice try,
Your Excellency.

1240
01:37:20,702 --> 01:37:25,833
Thank you.
Don't bother, then.
I'm ready.

1241
01:37:25,907 --> 01:37:28,307

turning your light off now.

with her?

this pickup in 35 minutes...

- Mr. Adamson?
- Watch him.

Oh, Mr. Adamson.
How lucky I am
not to have missed you.

1260
01:40:41,369 --> 01:40:44,304
Apparently you didn't hear me
at the front door.
Apparently.

1261
01:40:44,372 --> 01:40:48,172
I am Madame Blanche Tyler,
the spiritualist.

1262
01:40:48,242 --> 01:40:50,506
Good evening, honey.

1263
01:40:50,578 --> 01:40:54,344
Madame Blanche, I wonder if I
might suggest to you to remove
your car from our driveway.

1264
01:40:54,415 --> 01:40:57,316
We're terribly late
for an appointment.
Well, yes.

1265
01:40:57,385 --> 01:41:01,845
When you hear why
I've come, Mr. Adamson...
Or should I say Shoebridge?

1266
01:41:01,923 --> 01:41:04,118
You won't mind
being late at all.
My dear lady,

1267
01:41:04,192 --> 01:41:06,319
I know exactly why
you've come here.
How could you?

1268
01:41:06,394 --> 01:41:09,921
- And exactly why you and
your friend, that cab driver...
- You know George?

1269
01:41:09,997 --> 01:41:15,094
Have been sniffing along my
trail like two eager bloodhounds
these past few weeks.

1270
01:41:15,169 --> 01:41:17,399
I had no idea,
Mr. Adamson.

1271
01:41:17,472 --> 01:41:20,635
All right, Madame Blanche,
you found me.
Music to my ears.

1272
01:41:20,708 --> 01:41:25,407
I'm perfectly willing to listen
to your demands, whatever they
might be, but not right now.

1273
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:28,472
No demands, Mr. Adamson.
Oh, no, no, no!

1274
01:41:28,549 --> 01:41:32,383
Hardly that. Julia Rainbird
wants nothing from you...

1275
01:41:32,453 --> 01:41:37,117
but the privilege of making you
heir to the entire
Rainbird fortune.

1276
01:41:37,191 --> 01:41:39,352
The whole, lovely
millions and millions of it.

1277
01:41:39,427 --> 01:41:43,955
Now if she made any demands
at all, they were on me
to find you.

1278
01:41:44,031 --> 01:41:47,000
Through psychic means,
of course.

1279
01:41:47,068 --> 01:41:49,935
Let me get this straight.
Is that the only reason
you and your friend have been,

1280
01:41:50,004 --> 01:41:51,938
shall we say,
investigating me?

1281
01:41:52,006 --> 01:41:54,600
Oh, yes. And don't think
it's been easy.

1282
01:41:54,675 --> 01:41:58,042
Oh, Mr. Adamson,
you've given George and me
the devil's own time of it.

from a foundling baby...

to a man named Adamson.

she's still unconscious.

1332
01:55:02,162 --> 01:55:04,722
[Whispers]
Blanche.
Shh!

1333
01:55:30,290 --> 01:55:33,919
I'll put this end
into her exhaust pipe...

1334
01:55:33,994 --> 01:55:36,690
and the other end
in the window.

1335
01:55:36,763 --> 01:55:39,425
That way,
it'll look like suicide.

1336
01:56:14,167 --> 01:56:16,328
Better go and get her now.

1337
01:56:16,403 --> 01:56:19,429
I'll take her in our car.
You follow in hers.

1338
01:56:32,786 --> 01:56:34,720
You take hold
of her feet.

1339
01:56:39,693 --> 01:56:42,594
Jesus, she's heavy.
[Screaming]

1340
01:56:44,264 --> 01:56:46,198
George!

1341
01:56:47,768 --> 01:56:50,032
[Panting, Coughing]
Got 'em.

1342
01:56:53,540 --> 01:56:55,974
Blanche, you faked
that one beautifully.

1343
01:56:56,043 --> 01:56:58,944
You are still the champ.

1344
01:56:59,012 --> 01:57:01,503
Thank you, George.

1345
01:57:01,581 --> 01:57:04,709
Do you realize how much
the reward is for those two?

1346
01:57:06,653 --> 01:57:08,621
[Chuckling]
Yes.

1347
01:57:08,689 --> 01:57:12,250
But do you realize
how much more
the reward would be...

1348
01:57:12,326 --> 01:57:15,818
if we could
find the diamonds
and turn 'em in?

1349
01:57:21,601 --> 01:57:24,365
What's the matter
with you?

1350
01:57:24,438 --> 01:57:26,531
I...

1351
01:57:26,606 --> 01:57:28,540
Blanche,
what's the matter?

1352
01:57:39,753 --> 01:57:41,721
Blanche,
what's the matter?

1353
01:57:55,736 --> 01:57:57,670
What is it?

1354
01:58:28,201 --> 01:58:30,669
Blanche, you did it!

1355
01:58:30,737 --> 01:58:32,671
You are psychic!

1356
01:58:35,041 --> 01:58:37,805
What am I doing here
on the stairs?
You're not a fake.

1357
01:58:37,878 --> 01:58:40,506
You actually found one.
Look.

1358
01:58:40,580 --> 01:58:42,514
I did?

1359
01:58:42,582 --> 01:58:45,483
I'll get the police on the phone
and give them our good news,

1360
01:58:45,552 --> 01:58:48,715
and call Miss Rainbird
and give her the bad.

1361
01:58:56,029 --> 01:58:58,463
Operator,
can I have the police?
