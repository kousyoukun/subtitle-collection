1
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,680
Come on, come on.

2
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,380
She's been under too long.

3
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,510
Come on.

4
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,520
The name, pal.
Give us the name.

5
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,600
Za druziye.

6
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,010
Get rid of that scum.

7
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,130
Claire, come on...

8
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,550
Did we get it?

9
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,200
We got it.

10
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,970
Would you like to watch
a movie, Mr. Rosen?

11
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,430
No, thank you.

12
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,480
Would you like to watch
a movie, Mr. Phelps?

13
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,630
No. I prefer
the theater.

14
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,950
Would you consider
the cinema of the Ukraine?

15
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,010
Perhaps you'll
choose one for me.

16
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,450
Thank you.

17
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,750
Good morning, Mr. Phelps.

18
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,830
The man you're looking at
is Alexander Golitsyn...

19
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,660
an attache
at our embassy in Prague.

20
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,360
He is also a traitor.

21
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,430
He has stolen one half
of a C.I.A. NOC list--

22
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,430
a record of all our deep-cover agents
working in Eastern Europe.

23
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,680
For security reasons,
the NOC list is divided in two.

24
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,380
The portion that
Golitsyn already has...

25
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,720
contains code names...

26
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,780
but this half is useless
without its mate...

27
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,550
which matches the code names
with their true names.

28
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,910
It is this half...

29
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,550
which Golitsyn plans to
steal from the embassy...

30
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,450
during a reception
tomorrow night.

31
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,490
Your mission, Jim, should
you choose to accept it...

32
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,990
is to obtain
photographic proof...

33
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,020
of the theft...

34
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,130
shadow Golitsyn
to his buyer...

35
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,130
and apprehend them both.

36
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,340
We've already dispatched...

37
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,100
a team selected from
your usual group--

38
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,180
Sarah Davies is
already under cover...

39
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,330
Jack Harmon can hack into
any security system...

40
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,880
Hannah Williams will
handle surveillance...

41
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,670
your wife, Claire,
will cover transport...

42
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:56,480
and Ethan Hunt will be
your point man as usual.

43
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,660
He is now in Kiev...

44
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,590
and will rendezvous
in Prague...

45
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,770
at a safe house
of your choosing.

46
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,090
As always,
should you or any member...

47
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,960
of your l.M. force
be caught or killed...

48
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,170
the secretary will disavow...

49
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,100
all knowledge of your actions.

50
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,070
This tape will self-destruct
in five seconds.

51
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,590
Good luck, Jim.

52
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,830
A very straightforward
objective--

53
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,130
We photograph Golitsyn
stealing the NOC list...

54
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,800
follow him to his buyer...

55
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,300
apprehend both of them.

56
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,060
Now here's the plot.

57
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,110
Ethan, you're going into the embassy
in character during a party.

58
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,510
Hide in plain sight--
highest possible profile.

59
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,640
Are you game?

60
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,180
Wouldn't have it
any other way.

61
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,400
Sarah, you're at
the party already...

62
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,750
as the embassy's
Washington visitor liaison.

63
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,960
Make contact with Ethan.

64
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,820
You'll run the game
together.

65
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,220
I haven't a thing to wear.

66
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,690
Well, I'm sure
you'll work it out.

67
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,890
You'll Mark Golitsyn,
hand him off to Hannah.

68
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,430
Hannah, you'll have him
for the duration of the interior.

69
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,510
Find yourself a perch
and stay on him.

70
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,500
No problem.

71
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,960
- Jack...
- Yeah?

72
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,590
fingerprint security--

73
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,010
There's access through
the elevator shaft here.

74
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,060
So I guess I'm
not wearing my tux.

75
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,910
Open, close, get out.

76
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,780
Zero residual presence.

77
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,080
Claire, you're cover
outside in the vehicle.

78
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,090
Hannah will join you as
Golitsyn goes exterior...

79
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,030
you two stay on him
from there.

80
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,760
Anything goes wrong,
I call abort--

81
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,940
everybody
walk away immediately.

82
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,370
Regroup here at 4 a.m.
That's 0400.

83
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,130
Any questions?

84
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,120
Yeah.

85
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,350
Can we get a cappuccino
machine in here?

86
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,550
'Cause I don't know
what you call this.

87
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,610
I call it
cruel and unusual.

88
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,160
I made that coffee.

89
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,570
Exactly. Is it possible
it's even worse...

90
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,720
than that sludge you made
in that barn in Kiev?

91
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,590
Hey, take it easy on
my wife's coffee, will you?

92
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,080
We missed you
in Kiev, Jim.

93
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,990
Missed you, too, Ethan.

94
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,590
Off on one of your cushy
recruiting assignments again?

95
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,740
Where'd they put you up
this time? The Plaza?

96
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,220
Drake Hotel, Chicago.

97
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,200
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

98
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,240
Cushy! 24-hour
room service.

99
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,370
Chauffeured cars.

100
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,540
Fat expense account.

101
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,780
He's getting soft
in his old age.

102
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,770
Yeah, he is.
Look at him.

103
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,740
O.K., listen.

104
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,250
If that list gets out
into the open...

105
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,470
the names of our agents in every country
in Eastern Europe...

106
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,420
will be up for grabs
to the highest bidders--

107
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,620
third world terrorists,
arms dealers, drug lords...

108
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,430
any and everybody who'd love to get rid
of long-term coverts like us.

109
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:55,130
If they're exposed,
they'll be executed.

110
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,740
So, I'll run the whole show
from the crow's nest here.

111
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,050
Everyone knows their roles.

112
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,690
Let's punch out the details.

113
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,370
There's a camera built
right into the bridge.

114
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,560
Whatever you see,
it sees...

115
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,410
and then it transmits
it back here. See?

116
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,690
Can you hear me?

117
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,550
Of course
I can hear you.

118
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,210
No, in your--
Oh, you need an earpiece.

119
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,320
Oh.

120
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,770
You have lovely eyes.

121
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,340
Can you hear me now?

122
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,420
Loud and clear.

123
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,220
If he has a car waiting,
and he rolls...

124
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,220
you stay with him
no matter what.

125
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,890
You should take
the afternoon...

126
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,970
drive the streets
around this little quarter.

127
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,550
They're confusing as hell.

128
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,000
What do you think I've been
doing all morning?

129
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,940
We're using Waltzer?

130
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,400
He's our guy.

131
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,280
Isn't he chairing
the Armed Services hearing?

132
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,600
Not this week.

133
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,380
This week,
he's fly fishing...

134
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,080
at the Oughterard Slough
in County Kildare...

135
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,370
with one of our best
lrish guides.

136
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,460
Yup. And he won't be back
anytime soon.

137
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,420
...irrelevant at best...

138
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,990
or unconstitutional
at worst.

139
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,580
With all due respect,
Senator...

140
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:05,090
it sounds as if you want
to lead the kind of charge...

141
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,100
that Senator Frank Church
led in the 1970s...

142
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,310
and in the process destroy the
intelligence capability of this country.

143
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,940
No. Now, I want to know
who these people are...

144
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,310
and how they're spending
our taxpayers' money.

145
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,270
We were living in a democracy...

146
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,190
the last time I checked.

147
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,260
Stick of gum, right?

148
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,260
No?

149
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,660
No. Red light, green light.

150
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,690
You come up against
a lock you can't pick...

151
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,290
you mash them together--

152
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,960
Hasta lasagna,
don't get any on ya.

153
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,110
You'll have
about five seconds.

154
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,310
Just don't chew it.

155
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,550
Ethan, Jack's inside.

156
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,100
Let's go.

157
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,230
How do you do, Senator?

158
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,250
I'm Rand Housman,
the ambassador's aide.

159
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,390
Hello, Mr. Housman.

160
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,770
How was the opera?

161
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,410
Uh, it was boring.

162
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,970
Let me see if I can steer you
through this reception line.

163
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,650
How do you do, Senator?

164
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,800
His wife, Mrs. Reed.

165
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,370
Windows open by 2300.

166
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,140
Petr Brandl,
the mayor of Prague...

167
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,460
How do you do?

168
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,040
and Mrs. Brandl.

169
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,350
Oh...

170
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,950
I bet you don't
remember me, do you?

171
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,790
Of course I do.
How are you, Miss Norman?

172
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,940
He's in pocket,
on the stairway.

173
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,460
Mr. Golitsyn,
nice to see you.

174
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,000
Hannah...

175
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,810
pull the shade.

176
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,050
Sarah, mark the package
and go to two.

177
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,630
Your advance team mentioned you'd like
a tour of the facility...

178
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,960
so I've gone ahead
and set one up.

179
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,200
Excuse me.
This way.

180
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,340
Oh, great.

181
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,600
...which leads to
the denied area...

182
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,640
the only limited-access area
in the whole facility.

183
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,770
Governor's in position now.

184
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,860
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

185
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,950
Oh, I'm sorry.

186
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,450
As you can see,
there's a marine guard...

187
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,950
and video surveillance...

188
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,460
This place is like--Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

189
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,230
I know it's in here
somewhere.

190
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,330
Sergeant, why are you not
in your uniform this evening?

191
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,400
Uh, we've been ordered
to wear civilian clothes...

192
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,930
this evening, sir.

193
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,230
Be right back.

194
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,940
Tell me, Senator, do you have someone
on your staff named Jack?

195
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,050
Jack? Uh,
we did have a Jack.

196
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,950
An unreliable fellow,
as I recall--constantly late...

197
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,540
and behind in his work.

198
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,660
We were forced to tie him
behind one of my best stallions...

199
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,730
and drag him around...

200
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,760
my barn for a few days.

201
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,270
Relax your crack, Foghorn.
I'm working on it.

202
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,970
Sorry, sir.

203
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,950
Thank you.
Have a nice evening.

204
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,380
Thank you. Come.

205
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,070
That date with Sarah
is definitely off.

206
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,270
Higher.

207
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,000
He's heading to
the denied area.

208
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,890
Get moving, Ethan.

209
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,110
He's rolling to you.

210
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,820
Jack.

211
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,400
Jack, we're in
position here.

212
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,400
Jack.

213
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,200
I didn't touch it.

214
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,290
What about my coat?
I'll freeze.

215
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,720
Jack, open the doors.

216
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,710
He's in the box, Ethan.
He's in the box.

217
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,680
O.K....

218
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,850
we're taking
Golitsyn's exit.

219
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:28,910
Open these doors.

220
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:29,980
I don't have it.

221
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,230
I'm opening the doors.

222
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,390
Go under.

223
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,830
Go.

224
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,550
He's got it.

225
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,990
All right.

226
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,590
Saved your ass
again, Jack.

227
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,260
Give me a break, pops.

228
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,720
Such a nice ass.

229
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,990
And a lonely ass.

230
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,940
Transport in five minutes.

231
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,710
Yes, indeed.

232
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,680
Jack, we're in position.

233
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,190
Open the doors and
let the package roll.

234
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,960
Roger that.
Opening doors now.

235
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,590
Stairway, you're wrapped.

236
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,400
Go to transport.

237
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,340
Hey.

238
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,920
Jack, what are you doing?

239
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,530
I'm not doing anything.

240
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,500
I don't have control, Jack.

241
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,350
Uh, then I got a problem.

242
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,400
Cut the power.

243
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,270
Cut the power, Jack.

244
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,330
Come on, Jack.

245
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,820
Cut the power.

246
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,960
Jack...

247
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,460
Jack?

248
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,050
Jack?

249
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,810
Jack?

250
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,780
Jack?

251
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,100
Jack, do you copy?

252
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,080
Jack?

253
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,250
Man down, Ethan.

254
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,460
Man down.

255
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,220
Ethan, stay where you are.

256
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,710
I'm coming to you.

257
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,720
The package is
out in the open.

258
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,260
Jim...

259
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,660
he's in the open.

260
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,830
En route.

261
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,020
Jim, he's in the open.

262
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,120
Jim, the package
is in the open.

263
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,050
I've got a shadow.

264
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,000
Can you lose him?

265
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,970
No. Abort.

266
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,950
Ethan, he's out of pocket.

267
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,860
Can't do that.

268
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,440
We're being ambushed, Ethan.

269
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,940
Abort. That's an order.

270
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,620
Negative.
Golitsyn is on the move.

271
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,390
No, damn it! No!
I said abort!

272
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,160
Sarah, eye on
the package.

273
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,760
Jim, I'm coming to you.

274
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,230
Jim gave an abort.
We should walk away.

275
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,930
No. We are going to
recover that disk.

276
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,530
You understand me?

277
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,820
Now go!

278
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,090
Where are you?

279
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,110
About 200 yards
from the bridge.

280
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,840
They're covering
this frequency.

281
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,430
Cut all radio
communication.

282
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:03,600
Repeat-- Cut all radio
communication.

283
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,000
Ethan!

284
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,950
Ethan...

285
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,330
Sarah.

286
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:06,560
Abort. Repeat--abort.

287
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,140
Abort!

288
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,420
Do you read me?

289
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,970
Sarah?

290
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,350
God!

291
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,790
Claire!

292
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,660
Oh, my God!

293
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,750
My God!

294
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,600
Uhh!

295
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,930
Oh, no...Sarah...

296
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,230
Satcom Seven.

297
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,350
Central Europe, unsecured.

298
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,990
Designator?

299
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,400
Bravo Echo One One.

300
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,510
Switching.

301
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,570
This is Kittridge.

302
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,080
Go secure.

303
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,630
O.K., go ahead.

304
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,130
This is Ethan Hunt.

305
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:03,300
They're dead.

306
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,360
What--Who's dead?

307
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,480
My team.
My team is dead!

308
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,470
Jesus.

309
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,760
Golitsyn's gone.

310
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,810
They knew we
were coming, man.

311
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,910
They knew we were coming,
and the disk is gone.

312
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,230
Are you intact?

313
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,950
The disk is gone,
do you read me?

314
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,910
The list is in the open!

315
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,060
Listen, I read you.

316
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,990
Let's just bring
you in safely...

317
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,030
and then we'll worry
about that, O.K.?

318
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,200
Were you followed?

319
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,840
I don't think so.
I--I don't think so.

320
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,490
Don't think.
Be sure.

321
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,600
Are you clean?

322
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,730
Yes.

323
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,810
O.K. Iocation green,
one hour.

324
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,190
I'll be there myself.

325
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,800
You're in Prague?

326
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,810
One hour.

327
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,680
I, uh--

328
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,440
I can't tell you
how, uh, sorry I am.

329
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,880
I know how much Jim, in particular,
meant to you, Ethan...

330
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,030
personally as well
as professionally.

331
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,310
Yeah.

332
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,980
Here's a...

333
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,410
passport, visa.
Usual drill.

334
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,960
We'll work the exfiltration
through Canada...

335
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,270
debrief you at Langley...

336
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,790
throw the Prague police
a bone or two.

337
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,050
You know, toss them
a few suspects.

338
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,960
You follow me?

339
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,440
Yeah, I follow.

340
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,010
I think we've lost enough agents
for one night.

341
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:30,520
You mean, I've lost enough agents
for one night.

342
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,260
You seem hell-bent
on blaming yourself, Ethan.

343
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,790
Who else is left?

344
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,340
Yeah. I see your point.

345
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,770
Why was there another team?

346
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,570
What?

347
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:56,140
Of IMF agents
at the embassy tonight.

348
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:00,110
I don't quite follow you.

349
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,950
Well, let's see if you can
follow me around the room.

350
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:11,550
The drunk Russians on the embankment
at 7:00 and 8:00.

351
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:15,660
The couple waltzing around me
at the embassy at 9 and 11.

352
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,560
The waiter standing behind Hannah
at the top of the stairs--

353
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,220
bow tie, 12:00.

354
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,440
The other IMF team.

355
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,690
You're worried
about me. Why?

356
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,050
Well, for a little
over two years...

357
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,740
we've been spotting serious
blowback in IMF operations.

358
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,040
We have a penetration.

359
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:40,080
The other day, we decoded
a message on the lnternet...

360
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,300
from a Czech
we know as "Max."

361
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,280
The arms dealer.

362
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,790
That's right.

363
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:49,090
Max, it seems, has
two unique gifts--

364
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,280
a capacity
for anonymity...

365
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,580
and for corrupting
susceptible agents.

366
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,760
This time, he'd gotten
to someone on the inside.

367
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,340
He'd gotten himself in a position
to buy our NOC list.

368
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,800
An operation he referred to
as job 314--

369
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,650
the job he thought
Golitsyn was doing tonight.

370
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:12,380
But the list Golitsyn stole
was a decoy.

371
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:16,320
That's correct. The actual list
is secure at Langley.

372
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,550
Golitsyn was a lightning rod.
He's one of ours.

373
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:26,250
This whole operation
was a molehunt.

374
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,800
This whole operation
was a molehunt.

375
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,460
Yeah.

376
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:43,010
The mole's deep inside...

377
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,330
and like you said...

378
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,070
you survived.

379
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,730
I want to show you
something, Ethan.

380
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,890
Since your father's death...

381
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:02,770
your family's farm has
been in receivership...

382
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:06,770
and now, suddenly, they're flush
with over 120 grand in the bank.

383
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,050
Your father's illness...

384
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,810
was supposed to have wiped out
that bank account.

385
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:13,610
Dying slowly in America,
after all...

386
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:16,760
can be a very expensive
proposition.

387
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,220
So...

388
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,760
why don't we quietly
get out of here...

389
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,910
and onto a plane?

390
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,520
I can understand
you're very upset.

391
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,660
Kittridge, you've
never seen me very upset.

392
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,330
All right, Hunt.
Enough is enough.

393
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,700
You have bribed,
cajoled, and killed...

394
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,140
and you have done it using
loyalties on the inside.

395
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,170
You want to shake hands with
the devil, that's fine with me.

396
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:46,470
I just want to make sure
that you do it in hell.

397
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,080
Money, money.
Where's the damn money?

398
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,890
The other day, we decoded
a message on the lnternet...

399
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:21,130
from a Czech
we know as "Max."

400
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:24,800
He'd gotten himself in a position
to buy our NOC list.

401
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,900
An operation he referred to
as job 314.

402
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,380
Job 314...

403
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,040
Job--Job--Job 314.
I can't...

404
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:03,940
Job...

405
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,590
Job 3:14?

406
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,950
Job 3:14...

407
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,990
Oh, you son of a bitch.

408
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,390
Ethan...

409
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,250
what are you doing?

410
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,340
I needed you, Ethan.
I needed you...

411
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,760
on the bridge...

412
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,880
but you weren't there.

413
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,310
Ethan...

414
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,570
Ethan...

415
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,270
Ethan?

416
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,550
Don't move.

417
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,800
Ethan...

418
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:06,960
Ethan, it's O.K.

419
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:09,210
Just calm down.

420
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,470
It's Claire.

421
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,230
It's O.K.

422
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,230
You were in the car.

423
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,110
No, I wasn't.

424
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:19,570
I heard on the radio--

425
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:23,570
Shut up! I saw you.
You were in the car.

426
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,930
No. I got out of the car.

427
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,540
I ran to the bridge.

428
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,890
He said someone was--

429
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,260
Don't give me that.

430
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,740
I was on the bridge.

431
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,510
There was nobody
on the bridge.

432
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,870
What happened to Jim?

433
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,240
Wake up, Claire!
Jim's dead!

434
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,730
They're dead!
They're all dead!

435
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,710
Who sent you for me?

436
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,420
Jim's dead?

437
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,570
Who sent you here?

438
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,710
Jim...

439
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,920
Take off your coat.

440
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,240
Where were you, huh?

441
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,260
I--

442
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:09,200
Huh? Where were you?

443
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,230
I walked away.

444
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:15,260
He said abort.
I just...walked away.

445
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,890
That was four hours ago.

446
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:18,420
Who sent you?

447
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,230
Did they send
you for me?

448
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,270
Who's "they"?

449
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,790
Did they send you?

450
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:25,080
Look, who sent you?
Who sent you?

451
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,140
No one sent me.
No one sent me.

452
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,280
We were supposed to be
back here at 4:00, 4:00.

453
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,450
If we abort, we don't return
here until 4:00, 0400, 4 a.m.

454
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:38,620
4:00, Ethan. 4:00...

455
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:42,590
If we abort...4 a.m.

456
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,330
I've been disavowed.

457
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,790
They actually think I killed
Jim and everyone else.

458
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:23,860
Somehow $100,000 finds its way
into my parents' bank account.

459
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,860
Kittridge assumes I'm the mole
they've been tracing...

460
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:30,700
and I've been in the employ
of an arms dealer, Max...

461
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:34,870
for the last two years...
to get him our NOC list.

462
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:37,680
What are you going to do?

463
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,000
I'm going to get it for him.

464
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:44,380
Ethan, you're not
making any sense.

465
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,550
Whoever the mole is...

466
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:50,120
I think goes
by the name of Job.

467
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,570
I can't find him...

468
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:55,260
but if he knows
I have the NOC list...

469
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,510
he'll find me.

470
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,620
I'm going to go in...

471
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,160
and I'm going to talk
to Kittridge myself.

472
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,840
I'll tell him you had nothing
to do with this.

473
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,700
Claire, if you're not dead...

474
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:08,070
he's going to assume
you're with me.

475
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:26,860
The message is for Job.

476
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,410
That's right...

477
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,300
and I'm going to answer it.

478
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,710
Excuse me.

479
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:59,300
Can I trouble you
for a match?

480
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:17,540
Would you
remove your hat, please?

481
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:21,580
Why?

482
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,900
You wish to meet Max?

483
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,540
The price of admission.

484
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:38,460
I thought I was
going to see Max.

485
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,800
You misunderstood.
No one sees Max.

486
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,060
Then what the hell
am I doing here?

487
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,010
Allowing Max to see you...

488
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,570
and hear what
you've got to say.

489
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:52,400
Well, I don't communicate
very well through a shroud.

490
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,680
Well, if Max doesn't like what
you have to say...

491
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,350
you'll be wearing that shroud
indefinitely.

492
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:03,160
I'm willing
to take the chance.

493
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,650
Very well.

494
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,430
Who are you...

495
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:18,500
and what are
you doing here?

496
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,930
I need $150,000.

497
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:25,060
Ha ha ha.
Oh, really?

498
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,810
You--You--

499
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:30,950
And you thought...

500
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:33,030
if you simply showed up...

501
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:35,060
I might give it to you?

502
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,200
Why not?
You gave Job 125.

503
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,790
Hmm...the penny drops.

504
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,980
You are not Job.

505
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,570
Job is not given
to quoting scripture...

506
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,430
in his communications.

507
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:53,870
Then there was its tone--

508
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:56,440
aggressive but playful.

509
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,580
Job is not playful.

510
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:03,780
So you are something
of a paradox.

511
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,400
Well, that depends.

512
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:06,550
On what?

513
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,390
Whether you
like a paradox.

514
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:14,420
I want $150,000 today.

515
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:19,090
Ah, no. That's quite
out of the question.

516
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:21,030
The disk Job sold you--

517
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,990
it's worthless.

518
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,400
It's bait--part of
an internal molehunt.

519
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,020
And how might
you know that?

520
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,870
Are you another
company man?

521
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,380
Like Job?

522
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:43,570
Hmm...

523
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:47,740
We're asking about you.

524
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,460
I'm NOC--

525
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,160
Was-- Now...disavowed.

526
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,930
Why, may I ask?

527
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:00,200
That is the question
I want to ask Job.

528
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,310
I don't know Job...

529
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:05,750
any more
than Job knows me.

530
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:06,810
Even so...

531
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,650
I'm sure you could arrange
an introduction.

532
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:11,110
Why should l?

533
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:14,480
Because I can deliver
the actual NOC list.

534
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,020
The one you have
is not only worthless...

535
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:20,430
it's certain to be equipped
with a homing device...

536
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,790
to pinpoint
your exact location.

537
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:24,350
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm...

538
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,410
Boot it up.

539
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:28,640
In anywhere from 30 seconds
to 10 minutes...

540
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,160
you'll have
Virginia farmboys...

541
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,060
hopping around you
like jackrabbits.

542
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:36,070
It's easy to say
the disk is worthless...

543
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:39,840
when you say I can't
look at the information...

544
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,120
and see if it's worthless--

545
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,480
not a tenable position, sir.

546
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,520
O.K., use it...

547
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,980
but...

548
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:51,800
I'd suggest
you pack first.

549
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,300
26-27.
So far, so good.

550
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:11,910
Not so good for you,
my friend.

551
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:14,540
I'd say you've got
about two minutes.

552
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,440
32 and 33.

553
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,930
Doesn't mean it's a signal.

554
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,040
Could just be
the hard drive heating up.

555
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,950
44 and 45.

556
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:17,310
Now.

557
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,270
Man's gone black, Barnes.

558
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:55,370
He's under until
he decides to surface.

559
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:58,120
We can use somebody at the embassy.
Involve the local authorities.

560
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,770
We can cut off
his transportation--

561
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,590
What can we do, Barnes?

562
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,670
Put a guy at the airport?

563
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,220
How many identities
do you think Hunt has?

564
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,760
How many times
has he slipped past customs...

565
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,250
in how many countries?

566
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,860
These guys are trained
to be ghosts.

567
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,150
We taught them
to do it...

568
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,100
for Christ's sake.

569
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:18,870
Well, what do you suggest?

570
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:21,090
Let's not waste time
chasing after him.

571
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:22,910
Let's make him
come to us.

572
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,900
Everybody has
pressure points, Barnes.

573
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,950
You find something that's
personally important to him...

574
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:30,450
and you squeeze.

575
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:39,190
Gunther will never let me have one
of his apartments again.

576
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:42,660
Sorry I doubted you,
dear boy.

577
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,390
You are a good sport.

578
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:45,750
Thanks, Max.

579
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,260
Or is it Maxine?

580
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,810
Ha ha. I don't
have to tell you...

581
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:54,790
what a comfort anonymity
can be in my profession.

582
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,340
It's like
a warm blanket.

583
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:02,460
My deal with Job...

584
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,610
was subject to
a successful boot scan.

585
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,940
Obviously it didn't pass muster.
Deal's off.

586
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:11,240
What was
your deal with Job?

587
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:14,060
Um...$6 million.

588
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:16,090
I'll give you the same...

589
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:19,060
but I want the
complete list now...

590
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,870
not just Eastern Europe.

591
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,870
I won't do this piecemeal.
It's too dangerous.

592
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,080
10 million.

593
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:27,770
10 million in negotiable
U.S. Treasury certificates...

594
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:30,210
in bearer form,
coupons attached...

595
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:32,040
and one more thing.

596
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:35,810
Your personal assurance...

597
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:39,080
that Job will be
at the exchange.

598
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,190
Ohh...

599
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,870
Oh.

600
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:57,350
Max made a deal with you?

601
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:02,070
I deliver the NOC list,
Max delivers Job.

602
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:06,710
We've got 75 rounds
for your Beretta...

603
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:09,000
but only 20
for the Sig Sauer.

604
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:13,150
One pair of Visco glasses
with monitor.

605
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,680
Plenty of passports, and...

606
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:20,820
What?

607
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:23,400
You said it yourself...

608
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,260
if I'm not dead,
I'm with you.

609
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,360
Are you
sure about this?

610
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,660
Jim was my husband.

611
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:36,000
I want to get the son of a bitch
who did this.

612
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,660
We're going
to need some help.

613
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,760
We don't
have a lot of time...

614
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,810
so they're going
to have to be local.

615
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:43,820
What kind of help?

616
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:18,650
Simple game.

617
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:20,720
Four players.

618
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:23,290
Exfil opens the pocket.

619
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:25,050
Cyber Ops lifts the wallet.

620
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,410
Bank?

621
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:30,030
IMF mainframe.

622
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:32,760
Where exactly is it?

623
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,080
In Langley.

624
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:38,580
In Langley?

625
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,570
The one in Virginia,
Langley?

626
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:45,700
Inside CIA headquarters
at Langley?

627
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,230
Is he serious?

628
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:50,350
Always.

629
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:51,840
Aha.

630
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:54,180
If we're going to Virginia...

631
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:56,610
why don't we
drop by Fort Knox?

632
00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:58,120
I can fly a helicopter...

633
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,650
right in through the lobby...

634
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:00,970
and set it down
inside the vault...

635
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:03,000
and it would be
a hell of a lot easier...

636
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,280
than breaking into
the goddamn CIA.

637
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:06,570
What are we downloading?

638
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,130
Information.

639
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:09,030
What kind?

640
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,270
Profitable.

641
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,230
Payment on delivery.

642
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,940
I don't know.

643
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,170
I just don't know.

644
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,520
Well, this
doesn't sound like...

645
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,050
the Luther Stickell I heard of.

646
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:28,410
What did they call you,
the Net Ranger?

647
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,890
Phineas Phreak?

648
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:34,030
The only man alive who
actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.

649
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:36,490
There was never
any physical evidence...

650
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:38,810
that I had anything
to do with that...

651
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:39,760
with that...

652
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:43,510
that exceptional
piece of work.

653
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,130
You don't know
what you're missing.

654
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:52,610
This is the Mount Everest
of hacks.

655
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:55,080
You're all
kidding yourselves.

656
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,780
Even with top of the line crypto...

657
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,480
cray access, STU 3s--

658
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,700
Krieger can get it, right?

659
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,170
May take a little time.

660
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,850
What the hell do you mean,
"a little time"?

661
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:08,730
That's not what Claire
tells me about you.

662
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:11,660
Thinking-machine laptops.

663
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:16,000
I'm talking about
the 686 prototypes...

664
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,630
with the artificial
intelligence risk chip.

665
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:19,880
24 hours.

666
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,500
And, uh...

667
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:26,410
I get to keep the equipment
when we're done.

668
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:29,420
Luther, I guess you're
all out of excuses.

669
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:30,760
Ha ha.

670
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,350
Look, uh...

671
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,430
I just can't
hack my way inside.

672
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:42,430
See, there's no modem access
to the mainframe.

673
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:44,790
It's in what we call
the stand alone...

674
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:50,600
which means I'll have to be
physically at the terminal.

675
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,810
Relax, Luther.

676
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:54,570
It's much worse
than you think.

677
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:57,570
The terminal is in
a black vault lockdown.

678
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:00,170
The only person
allowed in the room...

679
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,680
has to pass through a series
of security checks.

680
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,230
William Donloe.

681
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,670
The first is a voiceprint
identification...

682
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,830
and a six-digit
access code.

683
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:15,680
This only gets him
into the outer room.

684
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:18,810
Next, he has to pass
a retinal scan.

685
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:24,700
And finally, the
intrusion countermeasures...

686
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:28,310
are only deactivated
by a double electronic key card...

687
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:30,070
which we won't have.

688
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:34,910
Now, inside the black vault...

689
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:36,910
there are
three systems operating...

690
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:39,310
whenever the technician
is out of the room.

691
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,570
The first
is sound sensitive--

692
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:44,220
anything above a whisper
sets it off.

693
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:49,030
The second system detects
any increase in temperature.

694
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:52,500
Even the body heat of an
unauthorized person in the room...

695
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,030
will trigger it
if the temperature rises...

696
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:56,650
just a single degree.

697
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,940
That temperature is controlled
by the air-conditioning...

698
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,440
coming in through
an overhead duct...

699
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,210
30 feet
above the floor.

700
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,910
That vent is guarded
by a laser net.

701
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:19,190
The third system is on the floor
and is pressure sensitive.

702
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:23,030
The slightest increase in weight
will trigger the alarm...

703
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:25,990
and any one
of these systems...

704
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:31,470
if set off, will activate
an automatic lockdown.

705
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:33,580
Now...believe me when
I tell you, gentlemen...

706
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,660
all three systems...

707
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:37,050
are state-of-the-art.

708
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:43,370
And you really think
we can do this?

709
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,180
We're going to do it.

710
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:23,520
We picked up alarms
in sector 3, 7, and 12.

711
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,550
Yeah, that's
what I've got, too.

712
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:26,730
What sector's
the air-conditioning?

713
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:29,550
21--but there's no alarm
in sector 21.

714
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:31,810
I got to get in there
and shut it down.

715
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:34,560
Nobody gets into any sector
where an alarm hasn't gone off.

716
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,360
You want to blow the fire through
this whole building?

717
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,440
No one goes into any sector
where the alarm hasn't gone off...

718
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,830
and it hasn't
gone off in 21.

719
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:43,980
Wait.

720
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:47,520
It's gone off.

721
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,140
Let's move.

722
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:02,690
Can I get you anything?

723
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,260
No, thank you.

724
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,580
21's through here.

725
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,070
He's recruiting.
For what purpose?

726
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:19,250
Survival.

727
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:21,770
Too shortsighted.
This guy initiates.

728
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:22,980
He's proactive.

729
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:24,950
The question is,
what does he want?

730
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:26,850
Where does
he need to get it?

731
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:28,900
Barnes, what the hell's
that noise?

732
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,730
Uh, fire alarm, Gene.

733
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:36,280
Do we have to evacuate?

734
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,290
Hey, there were three of you.
Where's the other guy?

735
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:31,830
Zero body count.

736
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:33,320
We'll see.

737
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,420
Hi there.

738
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,030
1.

739
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:11,140
2.

740
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,450
3.

741
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:14,480
Toast.

742
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,380
Toast.

743
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:18,180
Cake.

744
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:19,240
Good.

745
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:22,320
O.K., Luther,
I'm going in.

746
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,150
Everest, man.

747
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,360
You ready
to plant the flag?

748
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:33,420
Ah-choo!

749
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:34,850
Damn.

750
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:36,940
Krieger, from here on in...

751
01:01:36,970 --> 01:01:39,070
absolute silence.

752
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:56,830
He's rolling to you.

753
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:03,120
He's at the voiceprint corridor.

754
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:05,020
William Donloe.

755
01:03:20,770 --> 01:03:21,800
Outer room.

756
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,970
He's coming in the vault.

757
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,180
Come on, move.

758
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:31,250
Oh...

759
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:34,390
Oh...

760
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:05,600
He's in the bathroom.

761
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,790
A-W-9...

762
01:06:25,790 --> 01:06:28,450
6-B-6.

763
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:49,290
Holy mother of God.

764
01:06:49,310 --> 01:06:51,670
The NOC list.

765
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,890
He's at the vault.

766
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:04,710
Four yellows.

767
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:09,100
One red.

768
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:22,510
Get moving.

769
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:25,360
Toast.

770
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:27,950
Toast.

771
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:31,830
Merci.

772
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:31,740
Oh, my God.

773
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,880
Yeah.

774
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:49,480
It's...for you.

775
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:51,900
Kittridge.

776
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:17,400
You and I know about this.

777
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,620
That's where it stops,
you understand?

778
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:20,880
It never happened.

779
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:22,400
What about him?

780
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:25,140
I want him manning
a radar tower in Alaska...

781
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,080
by the end of the day.

782
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,800
Just mail him his clothes.

783
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:08,770
You contacting your buyer?

784
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:12,570
Ethan.

785
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:19,170
Ethan.

786
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,150
Ethan.

787
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:29,520
Oh.

788
01:13:29,570 --> 01:13:32,830
Excuse me. Mr. Hunt.

789
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:44,690
You're not going
to any meeting without me.

790
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:49,660
My contact
is extremely shy.

791
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:50,900
Ha ha ha.

792
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:54,170
I don't think you're in any
position to give orders...

793
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:55,410
do you?

794
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:58,370
Not while I'm holding this.

795
01:13:58,370 --> 01:13:59,580
Krieger...

796
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,400
Oh, you mean this?

797
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:09,880
That's not the list.

798
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:13,770
What's the matter?
You've never seen this trick?

799
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:23,820
Where'd it go?

800
01:14:26,590 --> 01:14:28,290
It's gone.

801
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:31,030
What?

802
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:31,960
You.

803
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:32,970
No.

804
01:14:33,070 --> 01:14:34,350
No?

805
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,940
No, come on.

806
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,430
But not too far.

807
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,700
I know what
you're thinking, Krieger.

808
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:48,620
You're thinking...

809
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,230
back in the computer room...

810
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:51,910
I was up here, he was...

811
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:53,610
he was down there.

812
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:57,650
Yes, and he was...

813
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:01,160
he was carrying two disks.

814
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:05,360
So hard to keep track
of these things.

815
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,390
Where is it?

816
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:25,260
Do you actually think l'd
let you have the NOC list?

817
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:28,590
Try any sleight of hand
with my money...

818
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:30,950
and I'll cut your throat.

819
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:58,520
You're off on one of your cushy...

820
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,050
recruiting assignments again?

821
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:02,340
Yeah. Where'd they put you
up this time, the Plaza?

822
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:03,850
Drake Hotel, Chicago.

823
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,420
I'm so sorry.

824
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,170
Krieger was my call.

825
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,050
I'm sorry, Ethan.

826
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:33,590
We did what we had to do.

827
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:37,130
I'm going to try
and get some sleep.

828
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:18,060
Krieger did
have the NOC list?

829
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:28,410
Now I want you
to hold on to it.

830
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:29,690
What makes you trust me?

831
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:32,030
Because if you knew what
you were getting into...

832
01:17:32,050 --> 01:17:34,160
you never would
have done it.

833
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:42,620
I'm not going to let this get
out in the open.

834
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:46,330
Exactly. That's your job
tomorrow on the train.

835
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:49,420
Don't let this NOC list
get out in the open.

836
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,610
What is the range
of this thing?

837
01:17:58,610 --> 01:17:59,750
It's hard to tell.

838
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:02,100
I'm going to have
to be close.

839
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:05,230
Ethan, I need to talk to you.

840
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:07,620
The unlikely setting--

841
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:10,150
a farm in the heartland
of America...

842
01:18:10,150 --> 01:18:11,580
the state of Wisconsin--

843
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:14,090
where federal agents claim
to have found the brains...

844
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:16,270
behind an international
drug ring.

845
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,630
The operation was masterminded
by Margaret Ethan Hunt...

846
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:21,660
and her brother-in-law
Donald Hunt.

847
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:23,700
They were arrested
this morning...

848
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:27,230
by Drug Enforcement Officers
in a major sting operation...

849
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:29,970
designed to expose
the illegal manufacture...

850
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:32,950
of the drug methcathinone,
known as Cat.

851
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:35,950
I'm afraid what we have here...

852
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:36,970
Kittridge.

853
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:06,720
Kittridge.

854
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:09,480
I see you've been out
visiting the folks.

855
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:12,880
It's Hunt. What do you
need for a pinpoint?

856
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:16,280
You've been watching
a little TV, have you?

857
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:19,800
Hauling Mom off
to jail in shackles...

858
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:21,590
was an especially nice touch.

859
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:22,800
He's in England.

860
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:23,890
Get M.I.5.

861
01:19:23,950 --> 01:19:25,870
Ethan, I want to assure you...

862
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:29,460
that my first order of business
after you come in...

863
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:33,170
is to have these ridiculous charges
against your family dropped...

864
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:35,670
and eliminated completely
from their files.

865
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:38,570
If you, uh,
if you come in now...

866
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:42,180
we can plea down the charges
against you as well.

867
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:45,560
Can I ask you something,
Kittridge?

868
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:48,540
Certainly, Ethan.

869
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:51,050
If you're dealing with someone...

870
01:19:51,050 --> 01:19:54,420
who's crushed, stabbed...

871
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:57,430
shot, and detonated...

872
01:19:57,430 --> 01:20:01,930
five members
of his own IMF team...

873
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:04,530
how devastated do you think
you're going to make him...

874
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:07,500
by marching Ma and Uncle Donald
down to the county courthouse?

875
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:10,910
I don't know, Ethan.
Why don't you tell me?

876
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:14,720
Lost him.

877
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,500
We needed
three more seconds.

878
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:21,570
He wanted us to know
he was in London.

879
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:37,330
You're a hard man
to catch up with.

880
01:20:45,670 --> 01:20:48,410
The next day I managed to drag
myself back to the safe house.

881
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:49,690
I must have
just missed you.

882
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:52,880
Anyway, I checked
our aliases.

883
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,990
And that's when you picked
us up in the States.

884
01:20:55,010 --> 01:20:56,370
But you left before
I could get there...

885
01:20:56,450 --> 01:20:57,940
and I could check
just so many places.

886
01:20:57,950 --> 01:21:00,720
Smaller countries don't computerize
customs records.

887
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:03,120
So I watched Europe.

888
01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:06,190
Once you turned up
in England, it was easy.

889
01:21:06,190 --> 01:21:09,000
You knew I liked the rentals
at Liverpool Street.

890
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,910
Hey, I showed them to you.

891
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:14,630
I remember.

892
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:19,460
Look, who do you think
you're kidding here?

893
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:20,610
A doctor's got
to look at that.

894
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:21,780
You can't sit up straight.

895
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,610
I can sit up straight.

896
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:25,830
I just can't sit
up straight very well.

897
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:29,430
Sit down. Sit down.
It's not important.

898
01:21:30,910 --> 01:21:32,990
Ethan...

899
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:35,850
I saw who shot me.

900
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:38,890
I saw the mole.

901
01:21:38,890 --> 01:21:40,740
It was Kittridge.

902
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,710
Kittridge.

903
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:45,020
Kittridge, Ethan.

904
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:53,240
Kittridge is the mole.

905
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:55,220
My God, of course.
You're right.

906
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:04,710
He was at the embassy
that night.

907
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,800
First, he took out Jack
at the elevator.

908
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:14,900
Aah!

909
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:20,840
He shot you on the bridge.

910
01:22:49,870 --> 01:22:51,600
Ethan!

911
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:08,890
He must have had backup to take out
Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.

912
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:29,480
How did he do Hannah?

913
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:58,660
No. No. He could have
done Hannah himself.

914
01:24:24,830 --> 01:24:26,290
Why, Jim?

915
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:29,500
Why?

916
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:34,830
When you think about it,
Ethan, it was inevitable.

917
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,460
No more cold war.

918
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:40,600
No more secrets you keep
from everyone but yourself.

919
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:44,940
Operations--you answer
to no one but yourself.

920
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:47,160
And then one day
you wake up.

921
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:48,770
The President
of the United States...

922
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:50,930
is running the country
without your permission.

923
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:54,450
The son of a bitch.
How dare he?

924
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:56,750
Then you realize it's over.

925
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,930
You're an obsolete piece of hardware
not worth upgrading.

926
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:03,190
You've got a lousy marriage
and 62 grand a year.

927
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,760
Kittridge...

928
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:10,310
we'll go after the no-good
son of a bitch big time.

929
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:17,810
We won't have to.

930
01:25:17,810 --> 01:25:19,860
He'll come after us.

931
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:22,390
What's going
to make him do that?

932
01:25:22,390 --> 01:25:24,820
What he didn't get in Prague.

933
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:26,320
The NOC list.

934
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:30,220
Whoa.

935
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:32,090
Jesus, Ethan.

936
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:34,850
Good for you.

937
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:36,070
Whew.

938
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:39,740
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV,
en route to Paris.

939
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:40,770
Tight security.

940
01:25:40,830 --> 01:25:41,770
No guns.

941
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:43,890
A real plus.

942
01:25:43,910 --> 01:25:46,910
If I supposedly deliver
the NOC list to Max...

943
01:25:46,910 --> 01:25:49,020
Max has agreed
to deliver Job to me.

944
01:25:49,050 --> 01:25:51,680
I'll have Claire and Luther Stickell
with me on the train.

945
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:54,940
Krieger is going to have
helicopter transport waiting in Paris.

946
01:25:57,750 --> 01:25:58,820
Jim?

947
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,100
I was in a cafe
waiting for you, Ethan.

948
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:15,870
And there she was...

949
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:18,500
standing in the rain...

950
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:19,960
alive and beautiful...

951
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:23,100
thinking I'm dead and gone.

952
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:27,840
God knows what
she's had to do...

953
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:29,400
to forget me, to keep going...

954
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:32,080
to get the job done.

955
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:36,750
She can't know about me, Ethan.

956
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:39,220
No one can.
Not till this is over.

957
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:41,300
You're probably right.

958
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:44,140
There's too much at stake.

959
01:26:46,470 --> 01:26:48,540
Once we leave
the safe house, Jim...

960
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:51,070
you get in there and crash.

961
01:26:51,070 --> 01:26:53,180
I'll call you from Paris.

962
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:54,590
You got it.

963
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,090
What happened?

964
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:25,320
I sent the message to Max.

965
01:27:29,270 --> 01:27:30,700
We're on for tomorrow.

966
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:39,960
O.K.

967
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:51,530
Come here.

968
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,810
Sir.

969
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,750
What's this?

970
01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:38,300
Incoming, sir, for you.

971
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:41,050
X-ray's clean.
Electronics, and no explosives.

972
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:53,440
Gene?

973
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,380
How long to
the London terminus?

974
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:01,500
20, 25 minutes.

975
01:29:01,570 --> 01:29:02,990
You've got 10 minutes. Move!

976
01:29:40,810 --> 01:29:41,710
Yes?

977
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:43,540
Give me Max.

978
01:29:43,570 --> 01:29:45,030
It's him.

979
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:50,360
This was not
what we discussed.

980
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:52,920
My apologies, Max.
It couldn't be helped.

981
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,900
There's a piece of black cloth
under your seat.

982
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:56,900
Tear it away,
and you'll find the disk.

983
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:34,930
Dear boy...

984
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:38,930
I hope this doesn't preclude
a meeting in private.

985
01:30:38,930 --> 01:30:41,570
Not as long as you tell me
where the money is.

986
01:30:41,570 --> 01:30:44,800
The mere possibility
is worth 10 million.

987
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,780
Baggage car, rack three.

988
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:51,280
Silver briefcase,
combination 314.

989
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:52,900
What about Job?

990
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:54,440
Wouldn't worry about him.

991
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,500
When you get the money,
he'll find you.

992
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:16,090
What's the matter?

993
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:17,830
It's not transmitting.

994
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,370
Try it--try it again!

995
01:31:19,410 --> 01:31:22,330
Damn it, I've got to get this through
before we hit the chunnel.

996
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:36,540
What's the problem?

997
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:37,950
Connection denied.

998
01:31:37,990 --> 01:31:39,480
I can see that.

999
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:40,910
Did you check the batteries?

1000
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,900
I always check the batteries.

1001
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:46,720
Don't you give me that.
Run it through from the top.

1002
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:51,690
This is bullshit.

1003
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:53,920
We don't even know
what Max looks like.

1004
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:55,600
We don't need to know.

1005
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:57,860
If he's got that list,
he's going to want to check it.

1006
01:31:57,870 --> 01:31:59,260
And that means laptops.

1007
01:32:10,930 --> 01:32:12,620
Excuse me, sir.

1008
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:13,940
Your telephone?

1009
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,550
- Hello?...

1010
01:32:17,330 --> 01:32:18,860
I can't hear anything.

1011
01:32:20,370 --> 01:32:21,790
Is everything all right, sir?

1012
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,010
It's just the battery is gone.

1013
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:24,040
It's working.

1014
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:26,720
Ha ha.

1015
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:38,930
He's in the baggage car.

1016
01:32:40,580 --> 01:32:41,520
Ethan...

1017
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:42,870
Kittridge is on the train.

1018
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:44,420
I'm right behind you.

1019
01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:45,880
The money's in the baggage car.

1020
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:47,460
I'll meet you there.

1021
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:05,330
Barnes?

1022
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,400
Ethan's right behind me.

1023
01:33:47,090 --> 01:33:48,220
Listen, Jim...

1024
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:51,240
is it such
a good idea to kill him?

1025
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,800
Kittridge is here.

1026
01:34:00,370 --> 01:34:02,940
We take the money...

1027
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:04,700
Ethan takes the blame.

1028
01:34:06,870 --> 01:34:09,650
No one else
has seen you alive.

1029
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:13,970
No one will believe him.

1030
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:43,070
Of course...

1031
01:34:43,110 --> 01:34:46,230
I'm very sorry to hear
you say that, Claire.

1032
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:50,450
Ethan...

1033
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:51,550
Yes.

1034
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,200
Ethan Hunt, darling.

1035
01:34:54,290 --> 01:34:55,840
You remember him, don't you?

1036
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:00,190
You knew about Jim?

1037
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:01,680
Of course.

1038
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:06,400
Just exactly when he knew
is something of a question.

1039
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,240
Mind telling me, Ethan?

1040
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:11,850
Before or after
I showed up in London?

1041
01:35:12,810 --> 01:35:14,090
Before London.

1042
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:15,910
But after you took the Bible...

1043
01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:18,580
from the Drake Hotel
in Chicago.

1044
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:20,560
They stamped it,
didn't they?

1045
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:22,200
Those damn Gideons.

1046
01:35:23,910 --> 01:35:25,650
Ethan...

1047
01:35:25,690 --> 01:35:27,560
if you knew about Jim, why--

1048
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:28,840
Why the masquerade?

1049
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:30,960
Why take the risk?

1050
01:35:30,990 --> 01:35:32,650
Well, Claire...

1051
01:35:32,690 --> 01:35:34,620
you've asked the question.

1052
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:37,330
And you are the answer.

1053
01:35:37,370 --> 01:35:39,630
I knew about Jim.

1054
01:35:39,630 --> 01:35:42,540
But he didn't know about you.

1055
01:35:42,540 --> 01:35:44,120
In all fairness, Ethan...

1056
01:35:44,170 --> 01:35:47,880
Claire was never convinced
her charms would work on you.

1057
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:49,430
But I was supremely confident...

1058
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:51,870
having tasted the goods.

1059
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:58,360
Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's wife...

1060
01:35:58,360 --> 01:36:00,640
Ethan.

1061
01:36:00,650 --> 01:36:03,190
Let's just get the money
and get out of here.

1062
01:36:03,190 --> 01:36:05,700
Yes, let's get the money.

1063
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:09,200
Ethan...the money.

1064
01:36:11,070 --> 01:36:12,310
Give her the money.

1065
01:36:16,170 --> 01:36:17,670
You've earned it.

1066
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:26,640
All 10 million.

1067
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:30,620
You know, Claire was
wrong about one thing, Jim.

1068
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:32,570
Oh?

1069
01:36:32,590 --> 01:36:33,800
What's that?

1070
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:55,030
Good morning, Mr. Phelps.

1071
01:36:56,640 --> 01:37:00,190
I'm not the only one
who's seen you alive.

1072
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:04,490
You son of a bitch.

1073
01:37:04,510 --> 01:37:06,290
It's over, Jim.

1074
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,250
Don't.

1075
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:15,510
Don't, Jim.

1076
01:37:15,570 --> 01:37:16,910
"Don't, Jim"?

1077
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,850
Aah!

1078
01:40:27,250 --> 01:40:28,460
Damn!

1079
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:34,560
No, it's in the tunnel!

1080
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:36,510
No, no, don't!
It'll crash into us!

1081
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:38,160
Accelerate! Accelerate!

1082
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:41,420
Red light!

1083
01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:44,320
Green light!

1084
01:43:36,910 --> 01:43:39,580
I think this is what
you're looking for.

1085
01:43:45,610 --> 01:43:48,120
Hello, Max.

1086
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:51,560
My lawyers are going to have
a field day with this.

1087
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:54,090
Entrapment,
jurisdictional conflict--

1088
01:43:54,090 --> 01:43:58,260
Well, maybe we'll just leave
the courts out of this one.

1089
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:05,240
I'm sure we can find
something I have that you need.

1090
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:06,770
In a freak accident...

1091
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:10,410
a helicopter lost altitude,
veered into a tunnel...

1092
01:44:10,410 --> 01:44:12,480
and collided
with a high-speed train...

1093
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:14,380
on its way
from London to Paris.

1094
01:44:14,410 --> 01:44:15,870
The pilot was killed...

1095
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:18,340
but no one on the train
was hurt.

1096
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:22,450
Authorities have attributed
the accident to instrument failure...

1097
01:44:22,450 --> 01:44:23,880
Reach your folks?

1098
01:44:23,890 --> 01:44:25,100
How do they feel?

1099
01:44:25,150 --> 01:44:26,480
About what?

1100
01:44:26,530 --> 01:44:30,600
The apology from the Justice
Department, VIP treatment--

1101
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:33,460
You know, the whole 9 yards.

1102
01:44:33,460 --> 01:44:35,770
Well, my mom was
a little confused...

1103
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:38,440
how the DEA could mistake
her and Uncle Donald...

1104
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:42,250
for a couple of dope smugglers
in the Florida Keys.

1105
01:44:43,670 --> 01:44:45,130
Cheers.

1106
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:48,340
To you, Luther.

1107
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:50,400
For being off
the disavowed list.

1108
01:44:50,420 --> 01:44:52,990
Hey, I'm the flavor
of the month.

1109
01:44:54,390 --> 01:44:56,780
Why don't you
come back with me?

1110
01:44:59,490 --> 01:45:01,040
I just...

1111
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:03,490
I just don't know why
I'd be doing it.

1112
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:08,530
Got to go catch my flight.

1113
01:45:08,530 --> 01:45:12,530
So how does it feel to be
a solid citizen again?

1114
01:45:13,670 --> 01:45:15,620
Man, I don't know.

1115
01:45:17,370 --> 01:45:20,010
I'm going to miss
being disreputable.

1116
01:45:20,010 --> 01:45:22,710
Well, Luther, if it makes you
feel any better...

1117
01:45:22,710 --> 01:45:25,600
I'll always think
of you that way.

1118
01:45:35,930 --> 01:45:38,010
Excuse me. Mr. Hunt?

1119
01:45:39,390 --> 01:45:42,800
Would you like
to watch a movie?

1120
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:45,090
Oh, uh...

1121
01:45:45,110 --> 01:45:46,800
no, thank you.

1122
01:45:46,810 --> 01:45:50,550
Would you consider the cinema
of the Caribbean?

1123
01:45:52,150 --> 01:45:53,880
Aruba, perhaps?
