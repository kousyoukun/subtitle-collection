1
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,290
Already thinking about the content?

2
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,124
Not yet

3
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,082
Why?

4
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,999
Do not we ever talk about it?

5
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,790
The horror film with cinema

6
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,915
Haunted killer can be seen in cinemas.

7
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:22,040
In short, quickly find the content

8
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,415
Please give me a half months

9
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,165
Well

10
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,332
I sometimes have these feelings occasionally.

11
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,790
I'm working with a new director ...

12
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,874
Still confused by the great director

13
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,540
I'll give you a half months

14
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,207
But this is the last chance

15
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:40,124
Representatives said that if there is no viable material at the end of this month ...

16
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,874
..Kau and I had to go

17
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,207
I hired you because you are the Film Festival Award winner for Best Director.

18
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:48,374
But now I've spent a bit of money on the outcome.

19
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,915
I am speechless.

20
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,332
Well, you can certainly write something decent.

21
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:55,082
- Yes - I trust you.

22
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,624
Well

23
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,082
This story does not seem too good.

24
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,207
Ah? So yes.

25
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,415
Is there nothing else?

26
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,624
I'm not so sure

27
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:22,540
No need to fear, tell

28
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:26,790
My friend heard it, about the oldest brother neighbors.

29
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,999
The elder brother was studying in Korea.

30
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,082
Horror movie that was filmed by classmates of the same class released.

31
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,749
He told me to see that half of the people have come out.

32
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,249
And one person died on the spot due to a heart attack

33
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,707
What is that?

34
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,124
Not clear

35
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,624
The student is being investigated

36
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:53,999
I heard that that the film is taken up by a ghost.

37
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,707
Ghost movie?

38
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:56,707
Correct

39
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,832
What is the title of the film?

40
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,165
I've never heard

41
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,707
When exactly that?

42
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:03,999
Do not know...

43
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,374
Can you contact the brother who said this?

44
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:10,290
Unable to reach him

45
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:20,165
Ah, I hear that sister went to Daejeon University film department.

46
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,999
Daejeon University Film Department

47
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,957
Who?

48
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,290
Ah, hello.

49
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:25,207
Whether you are a professor of the department of the film?

50
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:30,374
Ah, you are the director who made a short film.

51
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:35,207
So, what are you doing in our school?

52
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,832
A few years ago..

53
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,124
..siswa at this school

54
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,290
..mengambil horror film as a graduation project.

55
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,832
Sometimes there are classmates who recorded several types of films.

56
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:49,165
I heard, a film recorders say that it is a recording of a ghost.

57
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,790
What is the title of the film?

58
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:55,332
The title is not clear

59
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,165
If so, whether it was a few years ago?

60
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:02,290
It was not clear

61
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:06,790
I heard of a film taken by a ghost.

62
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:10,040
Do you find it here?

63
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,207
You really do not know?

64
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:16,165
Calculated from now on, I have become a professor at the school for ten years.

65
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,957
I heard about this incident for the first time.

66
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,415
Is it possible movie ten years ago?

67
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:27,082
This school drama department set up ten years ago.

68
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,665
Too bad you have to work hard for a while.

69
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:40,249
Representatives said that if there is no viable material at the end of this month ..

70
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,457
..Kau and I had to go

71
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,874
This is the last chance

72
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,790
Indeed, the more you see the more respectable

73
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,832
How old is there and whether there is a cult?

74
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:55,790
So you do not practice your work.

75
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,790
I told you not to again discuss work practices.

76
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,915
The old

77
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,249
Do you ...

78
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,124
... know if Cicario contact with space and time.

79
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,707
You have to say a few words to me.

80
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,582
Exercises that you do not yellow.

81
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,207
White spent 30 million

82
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:12,832
What do you know

83
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,624
Really

84
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,999
Excuse me ...

85
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:20,457
You're a student of the department director of the University of Daejeon?

86
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,665
Yes, it is true

87
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,915
Ok, let's play a game with his brother.

88
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,582
What game?

89
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:32,249
All three of you tell horror stories

90
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,499
Do not drink that awful

91
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,374
Then ... if horror

92
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,332
If it was really scary

93
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,665
I will fulfill your wish

94
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:40,874
- Desire - Hope?

95
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,749
Anything?

96
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,540
As a reference, if it is true, add 10 points

97
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,957
If this is your school, add 20 points.

98
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,457
Our schools, our school

99
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,124
Our schools?

100
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,415
older brother

101
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,207
Ok, you go first

102
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,207
This is what I heard from a senior.

103
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,749
There is a cinema left near our school.

104
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,249
But there was an actress named Sunmi.

105
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:12,624
When the film is burned, it becomes a ghost.

106
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:13,624
Cheers

107
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,749
Toast, toast, toasted

108
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,374
"Quick drink", fast food, fast food, fast drink ..

109
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,249
Ok, who's next?

110
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,457
I i..

111
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,790
Please

112
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,957
..Ten years ago

113
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,082
..Ada a film student who takes the horror film as a work of graduation.

114
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,499
Is not gathered to hold a movie screening?

115
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,582
However, the film director was filming ..

116
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,415
..very scary

117
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:40,165
Some people collapsed and died because of numbness

118
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,999
Oh really?

119
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,082
Do you know what the director?

120
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,957
This film is not for me to take.

121
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,290
It was a ghost record.

122
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,790
Ghost record? How?

123
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,540
It was recorded in an abandoned movie theater

124
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:53,665
The staff is waiting ...

125
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,374
..tiba turn up the ghost woman

126
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:59,999
Folding your arms and crush your throat and kill ..

127
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,957
..like this ...

128
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,874
He ... no, I want to say this.

129
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,499
- Sunmi ... - Hongtae

130
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,999
Your friend is not finished talking, do not interrupt ..

131
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,207
Correct?

132
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,249
Because I know the story details

133
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,165
The ghost film director asked what he wanted to record.

134
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:18,457
The director replied that I wanted to make the film the most terrible in the world.

135
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,207
Ghost has baffled director.

136
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,165
I'm talking about your son, damn it.

137
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,749
biting my tongue

138
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,749
Hello, You dare to argue in front of your sister.

139
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,749
Finding a fuss

140
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,582
biting my tongue

141
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,540
You do not have a problem when they bite the meat ten times.

142
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:40,290
The last part of the story is the most important sister

143
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:44,415
Namely, a movie called "War of Darkness".

144
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:48,874
Actually participate in the film festival

145
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,082
Is it true?

146
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:53,624
Ya, Festival Film Bucheon

147
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,957
Ghost movie

148
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,332
"War of Darkness"

149
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,665
Festival Film Bucheon

150
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:50,999
Mi-Jung .. .. Mi-Jung

151
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,540
Open the door

152
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,332
Park Mi-Jung quickly open the door!

153
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,124
Mi-Jung

154
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,332
Park Mi-Jung

155
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,582
Long time no see

156
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,999
You're forgetting pendahulumu.

157
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,165
Ah ... sorry suddenly comes to seniors.

158
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:49,165
You're so polite, by the way there is a need what?

159
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,790
Previously there was a movie that was released here

160
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,249
I want to watch the movie.

161
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,374
Is it true? Then come with me?

162
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,207
Does the movie "War of Darkness" ten years ago?

163
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,415
Ya

164
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,832
How do you know about this movie?

165
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,832
I'll tell you later.

166
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,749
Meet, "The War of Darkness"

167
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,982
This looks like the work that has been canceled after the finalists.

168
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,915
Is there any information is left?

169
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,332
It is not clear, just know when you open it.

170
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,332
Then open it.

171
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:32,707
It's not something that I do easily.

172
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:41,165
Do not worry, I'm calling to ask the producer.

173
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,665

Where do you find this?

249
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:41,999
You want to use this as a film material.

00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:55,165
No, no, no.

254
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:10,832
Do you know what is more terrible than death?

255
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:12,915
Living with horror

256
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:16,457
The most frightening thing in the world is a horror movie.

257
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:18,874
If you've been there,

258
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:21,624
You're going to feel that life is not as good as death.

00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,457
What are you saying?

265
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:44,749
No, it's really I get.

266
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,999
Senior, try again

267
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:49,499

268
00:34:50,916 --> 00:34:52,749

270
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:17,207

271
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:26,999
Harddrive successfully repaired?

272
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:46,832
How is my film?

273
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:48,832
Creepy?

274
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,582
Senior

275
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:58,707
You are okay?

276
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:07,082
How hard?

277
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,665
First, I do a recovery arrangements

278
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:14,374

279
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:16,249

280
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:26,415

283
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,457
Hard work

284
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:44,040
Wake up

285
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:46,124
Ok thanks director

286
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:48,040
- I go first - Beware

287
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:48,582
- I go first - Beware

288
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,874
- How? - I thought it was not bad ..

289
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:55,499
..kurasa appearance is very suitable for a horror movie

290
00:36:55,541 --> 00:36:59,332
I do not think his expression when sullen should ...

291
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:02,624
..seharusnya not like it

292
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:08,165
How do you feel the director?

293
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:11,540
I do not want to talk about the actor first.

294
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:16,124
I can not say even though the script is not ready, hence ..

295
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:19,415
Sister, when you will submit a manuscript?

296
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:21,874
Wait a minute, I'm almost finished.

297
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:26,790
This is where the film production process.

298
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:36,165
Why did you make a movie there?

299
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:40,040
I do, because I want to record a horror movie.

300
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:42,915
Why did you want to record a horror movie?

301
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:47,457
Because the horror movie saved me.

302
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:50,290
It turns out that, horror movies are saved.

303
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:56,374
You wondered how I could be saved by a horror movie?

304
00:37:56,375 --> 00:38:00,040
Actually, my most difficult time was when I was in high school.

305
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:02,790
Because I was really isolated

306
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:05,874
I was beaten up by the seniors during the day.

307
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:08,665
It was really dying every day.

308
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:09,582
Because it is always beaten ..

309
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:13,374
..menghabiskan time in the hospital longer than at school

310
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:17,290
Suddenly one day I saw an exorcism on TV.

311
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:22,457
You also know the most terrible movies in the world.

312
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,665
Actually let me keep my eyes open

313
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:30,790
His hands were shaking and saw tears

314
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:34,749
Feeling reborn

315
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:40,665
This is really scary, but all the pain is gone.

316
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:44,374
It is ridiculous that I have the determination at that time.

317
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:47,749
So, at that point I wanted to make.

318
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:53,665
The horror film to help people forget the pain

319
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:21,874
Power outage

320
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:25,790
Seriously

321
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:03,749
Aaa..

322
00:44:44,958 --> 00:44:47,457
When did we meet for the first time?

323
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:49,749
Aahh ..

324
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:54,124
..ketika we make your first short film, we meet each other.

325
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:56,790
It's been ten years.

326
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:58,790
It is also true

327
00:44:58,791 --> 00:45:00,582
thank you

328
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:04,832
Thank you for staying with me with this selfish person.

329
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:07,207
What the heck

330
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:12,207
I look very jealous of my predecessors.

331
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:16,749
I think you are very cool and very cool.

332
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:21,832
You were born entirely to dream.

333
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:31,290
I was mad, very mad.

334
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:34,082
So ...

335
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:38,374
..I see the script you write.

336
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:43,249
Sorry

337
00:45:45,666 --> 00:45:49,582
- How is it? - What?

338
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:54,249
I asked how the script.

339
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:58,624
Very interesting, very interesting

340
00:45:58,666 --> 00:46:04,457
But the director of women who appear in the game are exactly the same as its predecessor.

341
00:46:05,375 --> 00:46:09,665
What you do not feel awkward?

342
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:12,957
How many words what I have?

343
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:23,040
In a nutshell, the manuscript was fictitious, so do not misunderstand

344
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:25,457
I know

345
00:46:25,458 --> 00:46:27,374
But..

346
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:31,874
..sutradara women and youth in the script

347
00:46:31,916 --> 00:46:34,290
Like what would eventually?

348
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:38,415
End of this?

349
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:44,249
Since this is a horror movie, it's not a happy ending.

350
00:46:57,666 --> 00:46:59,874
all right

351
00:46:59,875 --> 00:47:02,665
Supposed to be full of sensation record here at night.

352
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:07,665
Go a little further and you will be there.

353
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:11,332
Exactly the same as what I imagine.

354
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:13,332
Such was the

355
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,624
Nice

356
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:34,374
You mean the ghost record here?

357
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:37,040
Yes, the plan it like that.

358
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:40,499
Some students call a classmate to this abandoned factory.

359
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,374
And documents the fear

360
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:44,624
There will be a real ghost

361
00:47:44,625 --> 00:47:45,957
Hello, are we going to turn up?

362
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:48,332
It is also possible

363
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:49,749
You said it was accurate

364
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:52,832
Let me say first that I would fix it in detail.

365
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:55,499
Well, here.

366
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:04,915
- Wow - What is it?

367
00:48:04,958 --> 00:48:07,790
- Aahh .. really - I'm sorry.

368
00:48:20,458 --> 00:48:22,165
What happened?

369
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:23,999
What is that?

370
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:38,999
scares

371
00:48:43,916 --> 00:48:46,457
Is not very good here?

372
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,332
It was unusual, serious.

373
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:01,207
You're going where?

374
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:03,332
I'll go in and see it

375
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,082
Nice

376
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,874
Who are you?

377
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:46,374
- To whom is he speaking? - the world's most terrible movies

378
00:49:46,375 --> 00:49:49,665
The most ...

379
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:13,415
- Aiihh - Senior, I'm really sorry.

380
00:50:13,416 --> 00:50:18,540
It's okay, why do you apologize, I'm fine.

381
00:50:18,541 --> 00:50:21,124
But have you heard that in fact there are rumors of ghosts here?

382
00:50:21,291 --> 00:50:22,499
Well, I heard it.

383
00:50:22,666 --> 00:50:25,249
Ghost woman who burned to death

384
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:27,499
Sunmi name if any.

385
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,207
Sunmi?

386
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:33,999
Ghosts what are you talking about, I'm more worried about the dust in it.

387
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:40,249
older brother

388
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:43,124
Do you want to go?

389
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:48,040
Sorry, I was suddenly in a hurry.

390
00:50:48,083 --> 00:50:49,457
I go first.

391
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,582
- Big Brother - You're going where?

392
00:50:51,625 --> 00:50:53,415
older brother

393
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:08,124
Who are you?

394
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:40,874
Sunmi, Sunmi

395
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:44,415
Ghost woman who burned to death, his name is Sunmi.

396
00:51:44,416 --> 00:51:46,165
Sunmi in cinema.

397
00:51:46,166 --> 00:51:50,665
I wish to say is that the ghost Sunmi.

398
00:51:50,689 --> 00:52:10,689
Subtitlekan.com

399
00:52:14,583 --> 00:52:16,957
Senior, I'm back.

400
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:15,749
This is the film production process.

401
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:18,790
What do you see? What is that?

402
00:53:18,791 --> 00:53:23,540
This is what I leave behind when I'm photographing my work.

403
00:53:23,541 --> 00:53:26,415
I think we can take it when it is used as a buffer.

404
00:53:26,458 --> 00:53:28,624
Open like this

405
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:33,124
Then, it will come out the fire

406
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:36,457
Then use this one two three

407
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:38,165
Oh cool

408
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:40,957
I feel this is too much smoke.

409
00:53:40,958 --> 00:53:43,374
Not too good?

410
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:47,374
Wait for the director to come and ask whether it is useful.

411
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:52,540
As a precaution, you grab one.

412
00:53:52,541 --> 00:53:54,415
Ok

413
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:55,290
I do not need

414
00:53:55,291 --> 00:53:58,124
Too dark to there.

415
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:08,249
older brother

416
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:09,582
Are you ready?

417
00:54:09,583 --> 00:54:10,832
Uh

418
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:13,790
But when the actress arrived?

419
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:18,207
Wait, he will soon come.

420
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:20,249
- Kak - Wait a minute

421
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:24,499
Not enough for me to go there and see the location.

422
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:27,415
- What is not enough - What happened to him?

423
00:54:27,416 --> 00:54:29,874
How he always acted alone?

424
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:39,624
Are you okay?

425
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:41,707
Give me water

426
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:51,707
Ji-Soo, she did not answer the phone?

427
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:55,040
My cell phone died.

428
00:54:57,958 --> 00:55:00,790
I'm going out to get around.

429
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,207
What happened to this?

430
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:08,624
Do not know

431
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:10,874
What happened?

432
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:15,957
Why is not confirmed?

433
00:55:15,958 --> 00:55:16,832
Ji-Soo, you okay?

434
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:18,040
Ok, I'm fine

435
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:20,249
Do not move here.

436
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,249
Jo Young-Min damn

437
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:22,457
You're going to get a flashlight first.

438
00:55:22,458 --> 00:55:23,290
Where the flashlight?

439
00:55:23,291 --> 00:55:24,957
Oh, it's in the back, ..

440
00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:27,249
Ji-Soo are in front and you have to confirm the lights in advance.

441
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:30,957
- Hmm - Ji-Soo, do not move.

442
00:55:31,875 --> 00:55:34,165
Be careful

443
00:55:42,083 --> 00:55:43,374
What happened?

444
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:47,790
Young-Min

445
00:55:53,458 --> 00:55:57,957
Young-Min, Jo Young-Min!

446
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:12,082
Senior .. it .. it ..

447
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,749
Is that ... blood?

448
00:56:19,166 --> 00:56:20,957
Kak Jae-Hyun did you here?

449
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:21,957
Kak Jae-ःyun

450
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:28,207
Jo Young-Min

451
00:59:30,875 --> 00:59:35,790
Please, save ..

452
00:59:36,208 --> 00:59:40,249
Please, save ..

453
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:51,874
Who?

454
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:03,749
Who are you?

455
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:07,832
You can see me?

456
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:17,665
Who are you?

457
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:58,624
Why are you here?

458
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:04,207
It was ... it was ...

459
01:03:04,208 --> 01:03:06,832
This is because ...

460
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:10,457
Do you think I will not be fooled when you dress like this?

461
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:18,457
Are you for real?

462
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:21,915
What are you talking about?

463
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:48,540
Can not be like this anymore

464
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:51,499
I need a break

465
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,124
It ... director

466
01:03:54,166 --> 01:03:56,082
I'm not Sunmi.

467
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:59,582
I am only ordinary human

468
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:04,332
I know, I can not kill you with this.

469
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:11,624
I went to your house to make trouble.

470
01:04:11,625 --> 01:04:14,124
I am sorry

471
01:04:14,791 --> 01:04:16,832
I understand about the "War of Darkness".

472
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:19,124
The woman who did it all.

473
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:23,082
Kill all the actors and let the movie appeared in theaters.

474
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:26,124
These all act the woman.

475
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:38,249
I know not what you do.

476
01:04:41,916 --> 01:04:44,624
So do not do it again.

477
01:04:44,625 --> 01:04:47,082
Let's go together.

478
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:50,499
I'm going to explain to the people

479
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,957
I will tell them that the director not guilty.

480
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,165
you're damn

481
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:59,874
I did not have a sin

482
01:05:11,791 --> 01:05:13,707
You

483
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:19,207
I know it.

484
01:05:31,875 --> 01:05:39,457
I took a video recording in which they died.

485
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:47,582
Then I edit it again

486
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:55,832
Then hang it to the cinema

487
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:56,832
What is that?

488
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,957
You

489
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:22,540
Is it crazy?

490
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,165
That's you

491
01:06:28,625 --> 01:06:32,165
That changed my life into a horror movie

492
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:01,957
It is time

493
01:07:01,958 --> 01:07:04,374
End of this movie

494
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:45,290
damn it

495
01:08:27,208 --> 01:08:29,124
You are crazy

496
01:13:02,041 --> 01:13:04,832
Come on, come on..

497
01:17:15,583 --> 01:17:16,665
Halo.

498
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:19,457
Hey, our director Park.

499
01:17:19,458 --> 01:17:21,624
So hard to reach you?

500
01:17:21,625 --> 01:17:24,124
I believe in director Park since its inception.

501
01:17:24,125 --> 01:17:26,165
Are you busy writing the script so it can not take care of themselves?

502
01:17:26,166 --> 01:17:27,415
Um, I'm fine.

503
01:17:27,416 --> 01:17:28,499
Take a look at the information that I send.

504
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:29,874
When are you free?

505
01:17:39,791 --> 01:17:42,540
Director Park, you're very difficult.

506
01:17:42,541 --> 01:17:44,999
Do you want to come to the office tomorrow?

507
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,499
We have to register, remember bring seal and passbook

508
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,415
Should apply?

509
01:17:49,458 --> 01:17:51,332
Of course, you have to register.

510
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:53,457
Why?

511
01:17:57,875 --> 01:18:00,249
Yes I know.

512
01:18:15,416 --> 01:18:17,540
You're also crazy

513
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,582
Director Park, investor just called.

514
01:18:56,583 --> 01:18:59,332
He had seen the video that has been taken so far directly.

515
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:02,165
He said he loved

516
01:19:04,333 --> 01:19:06,457
The atmosphere here is horrible, really.

517
01:19:06,458 --> 01:19:10,665
Team Art really is not permitted.

518
01:19:12,583 --> 01:19:15,249
I'm just curious.

519
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,749
Which part of the film is fictional?

520
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:18,832
Which part is real?

521
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,540
Huh?

522
01:19:25,958 --> 01:19:27,874
I do not know

523
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:34,207
- Directed look here. - Let's talk.

524
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:36,707
Director ...

525
01:19:36,708 --> 01:19:39,082
Let's take a good deal.

526
01:19:39,083 --> 01:19:40,915
See here

527
01:20:02,083 --> 01:20:10,249
Theaters on and the audience disappear

528
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:12,249
Then ...

529
01:20:32,416 --> 01:20:34,707
Help me

530
01:20:50,625 --> 01:20:52,415
Pak, go to ..

531
01:20:52,416 --> 01:20:53,749
Your call has been turned off

532
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:56,749
Daejeon, let's go to Daejeon.

533
01:21:27,416 --> 01:21:28,582
Senior where are you?

534
01:21:28,625 --> 01:21:31,624
I'm heading to the movies.

535
01:21:34,333 --> 01:21:39,415
Why? Why?

536
01:21:39,416 --> 01:21:41,582
Senior, are you really in?

537
01:21:41,583 --> 01:21:46,082
- Joon-Seo - Senior, Senior

538
01:22:16,291 --> 01:22:19,915
Senior, senior ...

539
01:22:25,839 --> 01:22:55,839
