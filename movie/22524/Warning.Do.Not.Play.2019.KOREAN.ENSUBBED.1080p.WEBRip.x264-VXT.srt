1
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,433
Lights went out in the theater,

2
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,894
and the audience disappeared...

3
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:13,479
And then...

4
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,397
<i>Horror-Mystery Short Stories 1</i>

5
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,404
<i>The real killer</i>

6
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,122
<i>A ghost</i>

7
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:58,232
<i>WARNING: DO NOT PLAY</i>

8
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,072
Any progress?

9
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,241
Not yet.

10
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:12,454
That horror idea we had,
centering around a theater.

11
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,916
Doesn't matter if
it's a ghost or a killer,

12
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,043
just put together a story.

13
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,547
Give me two weeks.

14
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,427
I sometimes wonder nowadays,

15
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:31,265
if I'm working with a
newbie or an auteur.

16
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,183
I'll give you two weeks,

17
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,852
but this is your last chance.

18
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,688
If you can't give him anything
by the end of the month,

19
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,273
both of us are out.

20
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,152
We brought in a film fest prodigy,

21
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:47,281
but development expenses
pile up, and get nothing in return.

22
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,284
You sure you can have something ready?

23
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:50,826
Yes.

24
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:51,785
I believe in you.

25
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,090
I don't like that story.

26
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,508
Yeah?

27
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,347
Got anything else?

28
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,226
I'm not so sure about this one...

29
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,520
Come on, spill it.

30
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,109
A friend heard it from
a neighborhood friend.

31
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:30,532
There was a graduation screening
for the film majors at his college,

32
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:34,536
and half of the people
ran out of the theater,

33
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,039
and one died of heart attack.

34
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,917
What was it about?

35
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,086
Well...

36
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,839
The student who made
it was investigated,

37
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,635
and he said it was made by...

38
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,553
a ghost.

39
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,347
A film made by a ghost?

40
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:54,640
Yes.

41
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:55,766
What's the title?

42
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,102
He didn't tell me.

43
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,645
How many years ago?

44
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,022
I don't...

45
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,857
Can you get in touch with him?

46
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,944
I've lost touch with him.

47
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,951
Actually,

48
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,996
I just heard that he majored
film at Daejeon University.

49
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,501
Daejeon University, film major.

50
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,722
<i>Daejeon Bus Terminal</i>

51
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,262
Who are you?

52
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,141
Hello.

53
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,269
Are you Prof. Jo Mi-kyung?

54
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:27,775
So you directed that short film.

55
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,779
What brings you here?

56
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:38,535
Didn't a student make a horror
film as his final project?

57
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,663
There are a few students
who shoot genre films.

58
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,668
The student claimed that
it was made by a ghost.

59
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,796
What's the title?

60
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,965
I don't know the title...

61
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,260
Which year?

62
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,972
I don't know that...

63
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:07,272
So you came all the way on a
rumor about a ghost-shot film?

64
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,067
<i>You really don't know?</i>

65
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:14,196
<i>This year marks my 10th
year as a professor here,</i>

66
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,490
<i>I've heard of no such thing.</i>

67
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,785
<i>Perhaps it was over 10 years ago.</i>

68
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:25,499
<i>The film department
here started 10 years ago.</i>

69
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,213
<i>Unfortunately, you wasted your time.</i>

70
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:38,012
<i>If you can't give him anything
by the end of the month,</i>

71
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,014
<i>both of us are out.</i>

72
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,516
<i>This is your last chance.</i>

73
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,813
The more I watch Nolan's
films, the more amazed I am.

74
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,274
Who cares about Nolan?

75
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,694
Your shorts are so dull because
you don't accept Nolan.

76
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,821
Don't talk about my stuff.

77
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:58,032
Always guessing and shit.

78
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,201
But you don't like
'Sicario', 'Arrival'...

79
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,704
Dude, tell him about Nolan.

80
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:07,499
You ruined your short by working
with Nam and wasted $30,000.

81
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:11,754
You can't talk about Nolan like that.

82
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,048
Are you...

83
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,135
Daejeon U film majors?

84
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:19,762
Yes, we are.

85
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,768
Shall we play a game?

86
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,394
What game?

87
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:32,149
Tell me a scary story.
Take a shot if it's not scary.

88
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,443
If it is scary...

89
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:37,738
If it's really scary,
I'll grant you a wish.

90
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,031
A wish?

91
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,949
Like anything?

92
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:43,577
FYI, 10 brownie points
if it's a real life event,

93
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,247
and 20 points, if
it's about this school.

94
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,625
This school? Our school?

95
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:51,794
Miss.

96
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,588
Okay, Sung-tae, you first.

97
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,091
This is something I
heard from my senior,

98
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,595
there's an abandoned
theater near our campus.

99
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:06,475
An actress named Soon-mi
was burned to death

100
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:09,728
while making a film and became a ghost.

101
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,689
- She did...
- Take a shot.

102
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,981
Take a shot!

103
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:16,568
- Drink it man!
- Shot! Shot!

104
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,362
Who's next?

105
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,446
Me! Me!

106
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:20,989
Sure, Jung-min.

107
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,825
This was 10 years ago.

108
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,036
A film student made a
horror film as a graduation film.

109
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,789
You know those graduation screenings?

110
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:33,627
I heard his film was so scary.

111
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:38,424
People passed out and
someone died of heart attack.

112
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,175
That scary?

113
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,844
Do you know what the director said?

114
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,222
He claims he didn't make the film.

115
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,433
But a ghost made it.

116
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,101
A ghost made it? How?

117
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:51,937
The crew were waiting to
shoot in an abandoned theater,

118
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,940
and the ghost appeared
and snapped their arms,

119
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:59,069
then twisted their necks,
and she was killing them...

120
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,615
I was trying to tell you
about her story, too. Soon-mi.

121
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:06,326
Sung-tae, don't
interrupt Jung-min's story.

122
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,327
Right!

123
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,414
It's because I know
more about this story.

124
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,751
The ghost asked him what
kind of film he wanted to make,

125
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,837
he said he wanted to
make the scariest film ever.

126
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,757
So the ghost knocked him out...

127
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,301
I'm talking here, you stupid nerd!

128
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,345
Let go! I bit my tongue!

129
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:28,932
Guys! How could
you fight in front of her!

130
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,684
I bit my tongue!

131
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,353
You deserve it!

132
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,979
Mi-jung.

133
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:37,816
What happened afterwards
is very important.

134
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,110
What I mean is,

135
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:46,825
The film 'Warning' was
accepted to a film festival.

136
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,202
Serious?

137
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,704
Yeah, Bucheon Fantastic Film Festival.

138
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,841
<i>A film made by a ghost, 'Warning'...</i>

139
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,011
<i>Bucheon Fantastic Film Festival...</i>

140
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:45,968
Mi-jung!

141
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:47,761
Park Mi-jung!

142
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,556
Can you open up?

143
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,392
Park Mi-jung! Open this door!

144
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,813
Mi-jung! Mi-jung!

145
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:34,725
Mi-jung!

146
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,397
It's been a while,
did you get here okay?

147
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,233
Yeah, sorry to drop by out of the blue.

148
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,736
No worries, so what's up?

149
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:50,824
I wanted to check out a
film that was screened here.

150
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,660
Yeah? Follow me.

151
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:00,626
A 10-year-old submission
called 'Warning'?

152
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:01,418
Yes.

153
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,879
How did you know about this film?

154
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,965
I'll tell you later.

155
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,349
Found it.

156
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,436
This film was selected
but got cancelled.

157
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,188
Are there any files left?

158
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,816
Well, I'll have to open it.

159
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,192
Then open it.

160
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,780
I can't do anything
about films in the archive.

161
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:39,498
Don't worry, I'll contact
my colleague about it.

162
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,710
Hold on, I got your back.

163
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:48,716
Mr. Kim.

164
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:54,179
A friend of mine would like
to see a film in the archive.

165
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:57,099
Is it possible to screen it?

166
