2
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,814
Hey, get up.
It's time to check the buoy.

3
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,546
Come on, Josh.

4
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:37,891
Oh, no.

5
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,258
So you regret
proposing to my sister?

6
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:46,329
What I regret is letting you
plan my engagement party.

7
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,169
I know.

8
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,837
Here, get this into you.

9
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,039
It's my great-gran's
hangover remedy.

10
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,145
Oh!

11
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,155
Smells like shit.

12
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,622
Oh, God.

13
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,662
You're spilling it.

14
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,961
You know, once you get
past the gag reflex,

15
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:19,597
- it's actually not that bad.
- Yeah.

16
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,566
Rory...?

17
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,044
I'll check the buoy.

18
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,912
Oh, my sister's down the beach.
She wants to show you something.

19
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,736
Rory: Looks like it's gonna be
a busy one. Want a hand with that?

20
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,572
What, you're actually gonna
get wet today?

21
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,601
Make a bit of a change, wouldn't it?

22
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,496
Hey.

23
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,728
I bet you've never seen one of these.

24
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,100
What is it?

25
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,800
Wow.

26
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,675
Were you looking at my butt?

27
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,203
No.

28
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,239
- No?
- Maybe.

29
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,759
Aww.

30
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,995
You look terrible.

31
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,940
Thanks.
It's your brother's fault.

32
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,509
But you smell nice.

33
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,383
You always smell nice.

34
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,045
Are you ready
to leave all this behind?

35
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,880
Where you go, I go.

36
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,818
Well, there won't be places like this
in Singapore.

37
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,695
Oh, we'll come back.

38
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,120
Lifeguard:
Shit.

39
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,790
Shark! Shark!

40
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,538
Get help!

41
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,238
Go get help!

42
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,746
Rory!

43
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,150
Get everyone out of the water!

44
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,216
Joe, give me a hand.

45
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,326
Rory!

46
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,097
No!

47
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:17,304
Rory!

48
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,777
- Shark!
- I can't hear you.

49
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,746
- Shark!
- What?

50
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,582
Give me your hand.

51
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,195
Rory!

52
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,996
I got you. I got you.

53
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,106
No.

54
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,581
No!

55
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,120
Along with
the yearly southern migration

56
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,222
of the humpback whales
along the East Coast waters,

57
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:22,132
"Surfline" surfing spokesman
Jeff Tripp said

58
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,796
people should be very vigilant
this time of year,

59
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,670
as we've seen large gatherings
of sharks in the waters

60
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,607
following the whales
along the coast.

61
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,007
Now, what they're doing

62
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,408
is hunting the whale calves

63
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,278
and bait fish
surrounding the migration.

64
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,982
So if you are heading to the beaches,

65
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,824
please observe the signs
and swim only between the flags.

66
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,320
Great whites are expected
in the area over the next month.

67
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,357
And now, on a brighter note,

68
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,961
it's been a picture-perfect day
here on the East Coast

69
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,038
with blue skies
as far as the eye can see.

70
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,675
No signs improving

71
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,612
for the sailors
and the windsurfers, however.

72
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,775
We seem to be hit
with the doldrums,

73
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,785
which means there are
no surface winds.

74
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,243
We gotta move to the car park.

75
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,678
Can't stay here.

76
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,834
Yes, please.

77
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,237
- Hey.
- Hey.

78
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,337
- Jessup come by yet?
- Not yet. You're safe.

79
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,371
Good morning, by the way.

80
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,313
Yeah.

81
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,403
Why are we stopping here?

82
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,781
- Hey, Kyle.
- Shh.

83
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,456
You're bad.

84
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,586
-Hey.

85
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,659
Shut up.

86
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,517
What are you doing here?

87
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,032
You scared me.

88
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,828
Happy anniversary.

89
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,602
You remembered.

90
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,474
11 months, baby.

91
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:02,140
It's not very much. It's just a song
playlist for when we go to Sydney.

92
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,649
Thank you. Thank you.

93
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,618
Ooh, and...

94
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,850
happy anniversary
to you too.

95
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:17,293
- Tell me you didn't steal these.
- Oh, Ryan.

96
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,559
Yeah, okay, okay, put them back.

97
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,930
But then I have nothing to give you.

98
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,594
Doesn't matter.
It's the thought that counts.

99
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,298
Put them back, okay?

100
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,498
Come on.

101
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,168
Oops, I hope we're not
interrupting anything.

102
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,275
You know, that's a really cool jacket.

103
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,609
Thanks.

104
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:39,084
Bet it's got lots of pockets, huh?
Mind if we take a little peek?

105
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,290
She's gonna pay for it.

106
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,054
Just take it out of my paycheck
if you don't believe me.

107
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,220
Paycheck?

108
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,457
You're living in a dream world, kid.

109
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,022
You're fired.

110
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:58,127
And you shoplifting,
destruction of property.

111
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,035
I've already called the cops.

112
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,698
Did you see all those birds this morning?

113
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,074
There must have been thousands.

114
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:09,444
You know, there were crows
and magpies and everything.

115
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,886
When did you get back?

116
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,898
Tina, this is what you want?

117
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,898
Josh, this is

118
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,270
Oh, Jesus.
Josh, look at you.

119
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,774
Go clean yourself up.

120
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,671
No, not the customer bathroom.

121
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,195
I got the call.

122
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,373
Oh, shit.

123
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,740
Whoa! Hello.

124
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,820
You starting to hear something

125
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,849
stirring around that head of yours?

126
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,162
The office is at the back of the store.

127
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:38,499
Cash pickup's in 10 minutes,
so you've got five to get out.

128
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,873
When this is done,

129
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,275
we're straight.

130
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,178
My brother's clean

131
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,978
and I don't want to ever see
your face around him again.

132
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,746
You understand me?

133
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,952
Whatever you say.

134
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,477
I want her charged this time.

135
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,558
She didn't steal this.

136
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,724
This is hers.

137
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,328
We both know you're not gonna
go through with it.

138
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,932
Just stop, because I'm this close.

139
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,238
To what?
Arresting me?

140
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,210
Yeah, real A-plus parenting, Dad.

141
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,338
- Jaimie, you're too smart to--
- Oh, you just dropped

142
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,611
to a C-minus due to lack of originality.

143
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,344
Okay, okay, what about this?

144
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,377
I'm gonna process you this time.

145
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,252
You can spend the day in lockup.

146
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,881
And what do you think that's gonna do?

147
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,654
Maybe it's the wake-up call you need.

148
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,290
Piss off.

149
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,266
What do you think your mother
would have thought about all of this?

150
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,603
Piss off!

151
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:59,067
Put that on.
That's it.

152
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,542
- Thanks.
- Great.

153
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,898
What the?

154
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,240
Give me the money.

155
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,475
Shit, man, there's no money in the safe.

156
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,579
Give me the money.

157
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,921
All right, just take it easy, okay?

158
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,639
You see?

159
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,006
Where is it?

160
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,811
Do you want a separate bag for that?

161
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,889
Hey, drop that fucking gun...

162
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,022
-...or I'll do this bitch!

163
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,531
Where's the money?

164
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,660
You I said,
put the guns down!

165
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,932
Put 'em down!

166
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:22,982
Thank you.

167
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,720
My dad was totally--

168
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,817
Your dad's right, Jaimes.

169
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,088
Not you too.

170
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,619
I lost my job today
because of you.

171
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,962
Who cares?
You hated that job anyway.

172
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,025
I care. I care.

173
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,969
Well, if it's that important
to you,

174
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,801
I'll go get your
stupid job back, then.

175
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,000
- Jaimie, just--
- No. Watch.

176
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:57,079
Oi! Freak boy
from history class, right?

177
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,490
You, get here.

178
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,393
- Get here.
- No.

179
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,330
You, get over there.
Stay back.

180
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,832
- No.
- Stay back.

181
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,391
Do as you're told.

182
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:45,528
What the fuck did you do?

183
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,595
Josh.

184
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,300
Get back.

185
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,332
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

186
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:54,402
Don't be a hero, mate.
Stay back.

187
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:55,572
Tina.

188
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:57,843
No!

189
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,578
Stop it.

190
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,345
What was that?

191
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,454
What?

192
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,725
Down! Down!

193
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,898
- Come on.

194
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,768
Oh.

195
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,343
I should know, I built the store.

196
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,087
Hurry up. This way.

197
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,989
Come on, come on!

198
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,389
Go! Run!

199
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,509
Hey!

200
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:49,986
Over here!

201
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,249
Have you seen anyone?

202
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,396
Anyone else?
Anyone?

203
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,862
I need help.

204
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,269
Anybody?

205
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,136
Help!

206
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,766
- Hey.
- Here.

207
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,767
Where's Tina?

208
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,440
Where's Tina?

209
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,472
Jesus Christ.

210
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,508
Can you help him?
I don't know what to do.

211
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:21,985
- Just calm down.
- Can you help him?

212
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,920
Calm down.

213
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,822
What the hell's happening?
What just happened?

214
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,587
We gotta get him
out of the water.

215
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,618
Help me lift him
onto this shelf.

216
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:45,710
I need you to go and find
anything you can to wrap this leg--

217
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,735
towels, electrical tape--
I don't care.

218
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,110
Okay.

219
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,685
Dad? Dad!

220
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,521
My God. Jaimie!

221
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,548
Dad?

222
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,321
- Jaimie.
- Dad!

223
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,356
Here, give me your hand.

224
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:14,933
Jaimie.

225
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,099
Da--

226
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:18,905
Dad.

227
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:24,971
How did you get out?

228
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,745
I was in the car.

229
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,412
I was in the car park, and...

230
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:31,422
Ryan Ryan--

231
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,651
Oh, my God.

232
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,490
Oh, my God,
Ryan's still in the car park.

233
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,621
- Forget it, kid.
- Ryan's still in the car park.

234
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:40,528
Forget it.

235
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:42,829
If it's flooded up here,

236
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:45,529
they've had it down there.

237
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:18,832
Tina?

238
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,535
Tina!

239
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:27,640
Okay, I need your help.

240
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,341
I need you to help
your dad, okay?

241
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:33,010
Put your hands here
and keep pressure on his leg.

242
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:35,019
Can you do that for me?

243
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,543
You'll be fine.

244
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,078
Tina.

245
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:48,258
Tina. Hey.

246
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,159
You're okay.

247
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:54,262
Look at me.

248
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,296
You're okay.

249
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,605
What what happened?

250
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,304
Where are all the people?

251
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,677
Hey, come on.

252
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,213
Here, give me your hand.

253
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:35,096
- Help me. Help me.
- Okay, okay.

254
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,506
- Help me.
- Calm down. Calm down.

255
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:58,886
Help!
We're trapped!

256
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,262
- Someone get us out of here!
- Is anyone there?

257
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,290
- Anyone? Anyone?
- Help!

258
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,734
Somebody help us, please.

259
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,670
Did you hear that?

260
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:12,335
- Did you hear that?
- Shh. Stop talking.

261
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:19,975
Where did it go?
Do you hear it?

262
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:21,747
Not when you don't shut up.

263
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:24,983
Well, excuse me for helping, Kyle, really.

264
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,316
It's behind you.
It's behind you.

265
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,691
Yeah, you find that noise.
You find it.

266
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,628
Good boy, Bully.
Good boy.

267
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:48,939
Shit.

268
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,847
Fuck. Fuck.

269
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:13,260
Fuck.

270
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,403
Can anybody hear me?

271
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,108
Hello?

272
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:12,729
Is anybody there?

273
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,892
Oh, fuck.

274
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:21,466
Oh.

275
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:26,340
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

276
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,252
Are you ready?

277
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,099
We've got to get out of here.

278
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,128
We can't stay here.
We've got to get help.

279
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,199
What--?

280
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,767
Oh, shit.

281
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,521
Don't let him
out of your sight.

282
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,761
The water's still rising.

283
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,290
No, no, it can't be.

284
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,394
The whole bloody town
must be flooded up there.

285
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:02,201
No, it's not.
Look, they're gonna come for us.

286
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,470
They know we're down here.
They're gonna come for us.

287
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,773
That's assuming there's
someone still up there to come.

288
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,803
- You, this is all your fault.
- Not mine, boy, not today.

289
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:13,180
Today Mother Nature saw us all
as sinners down here.

290
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,276
Why don't you just shut up?

291
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,514
He can't swim anywhere with this leg.

292
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,017
I'll stay here.

293
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,585
You guys find a way out
and bring a rescue team back.

294
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,426
What? No, Josh, wait.

295
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,432
Well, how do we get out?

296
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:32,402
With the car park flooded,
that leaves only

297
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,769
the loading bay storeroom
and the front entrance.

298
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,900
Josh, you cannot stay here, okay?
You know as well as I do

299
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:40,172
this is gonna bring aftershocks with it.
It's gonna bring more--

300
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,577
More waves, I know.

301
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,877
So you'll have to be quick.

302
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:52,481
Okay, well, Steven and l
will check the front.

303
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,436
I'll take the loading bay.

304
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:11,874
I don't think so.

305
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:16,004
- Bob?
- Yep.

306
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,378
You go.

307
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:20,914
Okay.

308
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:53,777
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

309
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,116
How could you not have
charged your phone?

310
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,089
I can't do everything, Kyle.
God, why didn't you charge it?

311
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:01,114
Uh, because it's not my phone.

312
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,650
Oh, well, then where is your phone?
Hello.

313
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,561
Oh, well, that's much better.

314
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,629
- What is it, Bully?

315
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,196
Why are you growling like that?

316
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,105
Because he's a fucking retard.

317
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:21,407
That is not funny, Kyle.
You're not a retard, Bully.

318
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:29,884
What the hell was that?

319
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:32,116
I have no idea.

320
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,577
What's that?

321
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,584
Where did it go?

322
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,560
Get everyone
out of the water.

323
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,829
What?

324
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,928
Get everyone out of the water now!

325
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:55,370
What's happening?

326
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,966
Tina!
Out of the water now!

327
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,840
- Can't get out that way.
- Hurry!

328
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,572
It's blocked.

329
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,170
Out of the water!

330
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,772
Quick, swim.

331
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,806
What's going on?

332
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,512
Tina, Steven, get out of the water!

333
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:12,518
Collins?

334
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:16,289
Tina, hurry!

335
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,264
Where is he?
Where did he go?

336
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,802
- Oh!
- Shit.

337
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,281
Jaimie, get back.

338
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,757
Help me!
Please help me!

339
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,283
Help me!

340
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,615
Shit.

341
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:21,723
Where did it go?
Did you see it?

342
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,886
What the hell could do that?
What is in here?

343
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:26,120
There.

344
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,271
Give me your hand.

345
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,745
Ow, my hand.

346
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,679
Jesus Christ.

347
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:53,683
- That had to be five feet.
- What had to be five feet?

348
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,284
- Six.
- Six? What do you mean, six?

349
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:59,296
Six feet from the tip
of the dorsal to the tip of the tail.

350
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,389
So what the hell does that mean?

351
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,901
It means there's a 12-foot
great white shark in here.

352
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,218
Fuck!

353
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:21,477
- I can't see anything.
- Just keep calm, babe.

354
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:23,639
We have to get out of this car.
I can't stay here much longer.

355
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,715
Give me your shoes.

356
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:30,913
Excuse me?

357
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:33,549
Well, I need something with a point
to break the windscreen.

358
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,354
Give me your shoes.

359
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:37,292
Are you crazy?
These are $300 Gucci.

360
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,228
They're gonna get wet anyway.
Just give me your shoes.

361
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,855
- No.
- Heather, give--

362
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:43,492
- I'm not giving you my Gucci.

363
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,261
They're not Gucci.

364
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:52,173
Um, clue you gave them to me
for Christmas last year,

365
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:54,074
and you said that they were
$300 Guccis.

366
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:57,046
Um, clue I know I did,
and they're not.

367
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,940
You bought me fake Gucci.

368
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,509
You wouldn't have known
if I didn't just tell you.

369
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,579
I can't believe you.
Fake Gucci?

370
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:07,750
Just give me your shoes.

371
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:11,822
What are you doing?

372
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,103
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

373
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:33,975
Hey! Hey, over here.

374
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:36,316
Freak boy? Is that you?

375
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:39,516
Jesus Christ, I never thought
I'd actually be happy to see you.

376
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,390
Yeah, no shit. Did you find
anyone? Is there anyone else?

377
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,519
There's bodies everywhere.
There's no one alive.

378
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,292
Well, did you check
the ramp?

379
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,424
It's all jammed up.
I can't get through.

380
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:52,264
You got a phone
or something in there?

381
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,464
Uh, no.

382
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:57,133
Holy shit, Kyle. Kyle!

383
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:59,165
What? What?

384
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,109
Oh, Jesus Christ.

385
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:03,940
Oh, shit.

386
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,457
It's okay.

387
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:20,122
- I think it's gone.

388
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:21,529
Oh, shit.

389
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,702
Oh, man,
this is not happening.

390
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,707
This is so not happening.

391
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,971
You you're a cop, right?

392
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,410
You gotta do something.

393
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,539
For Christsakes, do something.

394
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:39,913
Do you have any ideas?

395
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,180
Oh, you think
this is funny, do you?

396
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,949
- More ironic, really.
- Oh, really? Well, please share.

397
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:48,584
I'm sure we could all do
with a good ironic laugh right now.

398
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,617
Think about it.

399
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,789
You bust your ass in here
eight hours a day, seven days a week.

400
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:55,492
Right?

401
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:58,194
You'll probably hump away like that
for the next 40 years.

402
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:03,937
So whatever way you cut it,
this place was gonna kill you.

403
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,738
Now it's just sooner
rather than later.

404
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:09,075
You son of a bitch.

405
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:11,445
I want you to know,

406
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:15,248
the woman you killed--
her name was Julie

407
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:17,378
and she was a friend.

408
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,412
- I didn't kill anyone.
- It makes no difference.

409
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:21,981
She died during your robbery,
so it's your fault, you bastard.

410
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:24,324
If we get out of here alive, I swear
I'm gonna make you fucking pay.

411
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:26,488
Enough!

412
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,758
It's coming back.

413
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:35,732
Why does it keep doing that--
just circling?

414
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,764
Because it's not sure
what we are.

415
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:39,537
It's curious.

416
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:41,066
Curious about what?

417
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:44,410
A shark's only curious
about one thing.

418
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:47,042
It's trying to decide
if we're food or not.

419
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,256
- What was that?
- Hang on, everybody.

420
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,692
Just hang on.

421
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:11,400
We have another problem.

422
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:17,641
Why are you laughing?

423
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:19,615
'Cause he just realized
when the water hits those cables,

424
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,914
this whole place will light up
like a Christmas tree.

425
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:24,944
Jessup, where do we shut it down?

426
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,687
The storage room.

427
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,163
All the power mains
are in the storage room.

428
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:38,857
I'll go.

429
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,234
- What?
- Everyone go to the end of the shelf,

430
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:43,865
make as much noise as you can.

431
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,397
I'll swim for it.

432
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:46,875
Josh, no.

433
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,743
I mean, you can't.
Your arm look at your arm.

434
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,941
I mean, the shark will go
straight for you.

435
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:54,348
You can't, not with that.

436
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:56,648
I don't think we have
any other options.

437
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,725
Hold on.

438
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:09,222
I have an idea.

439
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,369
Do you see it anywhere?

440
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,501
Yeah, I see it, but I'm keeping it
a secret from you

441
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:22,171
because I want you to be surprised.

442
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:24,407
Oh, well, thank you for your
thoughtfulness, Kyle, really.

443
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,575
It's what I always dreamed of
in a boyfriend.

444
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:32,449
Oh, I can't handle this much longer.

445
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:34,389
It may surprise you,
but I am not equipped

446
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:36,324
to deal with this kind of situation.

447
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,818
Here, Bully,
I need some space.

448
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,601
Kyle, do something.
You have to do something.

449
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,765
Like what?
Ask the fucking thing to go away?

450
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:52,365
- Oh, shit.

451
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:55,708
- Help!
- Help us, please! Help us!

452
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,138
Get down. Get down.
Get down.

453
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:06,715
Help us!
Do something!

454
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:09,055
- Okay.
- Help us!

455
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:17,566
All right, just get back in the car.

456
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,694
Just stay as still and quiet as possible.

457
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:21,966
- What, are you fucking insane?
- Just listen, listen.

458
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,939
Why don't you jump in the water
and do a couple of laps?

459
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:25,703
All right, just listen to me.
You gotta keep still, okay?

460
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:27,972
The more you scream,
the more the shark's gonna come.

461
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,707
Hey, hey, just get back in and wait.

462
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:32,510
I'm gonna get the shark to come to me.

463
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:33,982
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What?

464
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:37,577
When I get it over here,
you swim like hell

465
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:40,055
for my van over there.
You see it?

466
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:45,318
This is crazy.

467
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,763
Babe, look at me.

468
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:55,533
Don't move.

469
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:58,666
Stay here as still as you can.
Can you do that?

470
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:17,486
You think this will work?

471
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:19,392
Absolutely.

472
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:22,990
I wouldn't eat a cheeseburger
with its wrapping on.

473
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:24,864
But of course...

474
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,893
I'm not a shark.

475
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,040
Here.

476
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,066
Yeah.

477
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:47,880
Look...

478
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:51,890
you don't know me...

479
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:56,995
- but when Tina came to Singapore--
- I don't want to know about it.

480
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:58,968
Well, you should.

481
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,330
We were never--

482
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:11,338
The whole time she was there...

483
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:15,117
she missed you.

484
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:19,312
It wasn't your fault--

485
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:21,756
what happened.

486
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,051
That's what she said.

487
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,756
Hey, I found some water.

488
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,893
Good?

489
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,606
You come back, okay?

490
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:50,414
Just come back.

491
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,223
Ready?

492
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,090
Here you go.

493
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:33,406
Oh, shit.

494
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,745
Oh, man, he's not gonna make it.

495
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,661
He did it.

496
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:31,937
- He did it.
- Where is he, Josh?

497
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:19,645
No!

498
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:23,519
No.

499
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:27,729
Fuck it. No!

500
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:55,022
Hey... are you okay?

501
00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:01,023
Look,

502
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:03,294
we've got to try to keep it together.

503
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,324
Okay?

504
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:11,733
I know. I just

505
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:18,103
When's it gonna end?

506
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:23,842
And why is this happening?

507
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:29,392
Why?

508
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:36,154
When my mom was dying--

509
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:39,327
she died two years ago--

510
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:42,497
she was so sick.

511
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:47,009
I tried.

512
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:53,039
A couple of months
before she died, I left.

513
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:55,278
I couldn't take it.

514
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:57,786
I just took off to America.

515
00:55:57,821 --> 00:56:00,051
And...

516
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,581
I wasn't there

517
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,616
when...

518
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:13,127
So this is my payback.

519
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:15,160
Life saying, "Screw you.

520
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:18,831
How are you gonna
run away from this?"

521
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,981
Here.

522
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:38,255
There's a secret to it.

523
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:41,521
You have to do it gently.

524
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:44,727
Just peel the two
pieces of plastic apart

525
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:46,759
Iike that.

526
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,804
Thanks.

527
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:55,569
Was she a friend of yours
the girl that got killed?

528
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:58,843
Julie?

529
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:00,873
No, not really.

530
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:03,977
I mean, I knew her
and everything, but

531
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:11,449
It was just supposed
to be me, you know?

532
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:13,485
A quick in and out.
Nobody else, just me.

533
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:17,698
I guess it's true what they say

534
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:19,725
"Let the devil take your hand

535
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,703
and God will make you pay."

536
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,375
We're not gonna make it
out of here, are we?

537
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:30,140
I don't believe that.

538
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:34,339
No.

539
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:37,476
We'll make it out of here.

540
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:41,687
Good.

541
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:37,676
Oh, shit, it's working.
It's working.

542
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:39,579
Go now.
Go, go now, now.

543
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:41,106
Come on, go, go, go.

544
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:44,052
Fuck! Swim!

545
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:47,315
- Swim!
- Climb! Just climb!

546
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:51,917
Sorry, Bully.

547
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,590
- Fuck!

548
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:56,792
Stay back!

549
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:01,060
Bully! Bully!

550
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,608
Fuck!

551
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:20,254
You need to
slide it through...

552
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:22,417
not fling it.

553
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:39,567
It's strong, but it can't
take much weight.

554
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,848
Screw this.
I'm out of here.

555
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:02,756
If you can get through,
you get help and bring them back.

556
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:04,528
Yeah, yeah, all right, all right.

557
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:13,039
- Ready?
- Let's go.

558
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:27,817
Got it?

559
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:56,084
- Pull him up!
- I can make it. I can make it.

560
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:58,952
- Pull up now.
- I can make it. I'm okay.

561
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:24,609
Give me your hand.

562
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:49,228
Are you gonna talk to me
or what?

563
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:52,070
No.

564
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:54,133
- Heather, I didn't.
- Don't.

565
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:56,839
Don't even try.

566
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,006
Murderer.

567
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:04,612
I'm not a murderer.

568
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:06,417
Oh, yes, you are.

569
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:10,119
You're a dog murderer,
which is worse than a person murderer.

570
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,218
How could you?

571
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:16,356
Heather, I didn't have a choice.

572
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:19,391
Bullshit.
You always have a choice.

573
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:23,234
Murderer.

574
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:28,467
Whatever.

575
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:37,849
Argh!

576
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,414
Uh!

577
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:05,242
Hey. Hey.

578
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,272
Can that pipe hold my weight?

579
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:10,308
I can't get out this way.
I want to get to that door.

580
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:12,048
What do you think?

581
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:13,953
I don't know.
Give it a go.

582
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,794
- You all right?
- Yeah.

583
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:31,830
Can you see it anywhere?

584
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:34,308
I don't know.
You're the one with the bloody torch.

585
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:41,846
Shit.

586
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:50,619
Are you okay?

587
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,724
Whew.

588
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,797
Ooh, Jesus.

589
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:07,268
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

590
01:04:12,715 --> 01:04:14,979
Good stuff.
Keep going.

591
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:16,985
Is he gonna make it?

592
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,611
Babe, shut up.

593
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:27,022
Shit.

594
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:35,030
You're good. You got,
like, six feet. Keep going.

595
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:47,776
Oh, shit.
Hold on.

596
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:49,375
Grab on. Grab on.

597
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:50,908
Shit.

598
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:56,849
Swim, swim, swim.
Quick, quick.

599
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:00,693
- Quick.
- Got you, buddy.

600
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:05,323
Kyle! No!

601
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:07,598
- Quick, quick.
- Give me your hand.

602
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:14,834
Give me your hand!

603
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:44,469
We're not gonna just
sit around and wait for that thing

604
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:46,441
to pick us off one by one.

605
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:48,409
And what do you think
you're gonna do?

606
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,435
At the very least, I'm gonna die
on my own terms

607
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:52,140
and not when that damn fish
decides it's time.

608
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:54,445
So you think what?

609
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:56,678
You're gonna catch it?

610
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:01,015
Why not?

611
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:05,523
What are you gonna do if you catch it?

612
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:08,724
Spark up the barbie
and crack open the tartare sauce?

613
01:06:08,764 --> 01:06:10,493
I'm gonna tie it to this shelf

614
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:12,592
and we're gonna swim like hell
to the entrance.

615
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,569
Get the hell out of here.

616
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:17,128
All I need isa hook.

617
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:22,473
You can't save everybody, mate.

618
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:24,672
You must be getting used
to that by now.

619
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:30,008
It's not that far.

620
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:33,284
If we can distract the shark,

621
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:34,789
I'll swim it,

622
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,792
get the hooks.

623
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:42,520
I'll do it.

624
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:45,033
What? Dad, no.

625
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:46,830
Oh, you can't, not with your leg.

626
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:48,359
My leg is exactly why I should go.

627
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:49,928
Dad, no, please.

628
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,205
You keep my daughter safe.

629
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:55,472
No matter what happens,
you get her out of here, okay?

630
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:11,352
Jaimie!

631
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:15,329
Jaimie! Jaimie!

632
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:17,958
Naomi, make noise,
get the shark to come toward us.

633
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:23,203
Hurry, quick, make some noise!

634
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:44,621
Jaimes, are you okay?

635
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,226
Yeah.

636
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:01,202
Okay, hang on.

637
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:07,173
Jump!

638
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:23,828
Good work, kid.

639
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,782
So what's the deal?

640
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:52,953
Do you know her
or just want to?

641
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,933
I used to.

642
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,628
Used to, huh?

643
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:01,659
'Cause I can see by that look in your eye,

644
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:04,002
whatever was there, still is.

645
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:08,173
That was a long time ago.

646
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:20,385
Trust me,
after this shit here,

647
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:22,822
everything we knew
is a long time ago.

648
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:45,542
You still wear that.

649
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,110
Yeah.

650
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:03,192
- Tina
- You don't have to.

651
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:05,564
- We don't have to do this, Josh.
- No, I do.

652
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:11,031
I wasn't fair to you.

653
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:15,400
I just..

654
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:19,947
I always set the buoy.

655
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:26,251
Rory did it for me that day.

656
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:30,549
But I should have been
the one out there.

657
01:10:30,593 --> 01:10:31,753
Josh.

658
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:34,126
And I hated myself.

659
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:39,964
But...

660
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:43,563
before I knew
what had happened,

661
01:10:43,606 --> 01:10:46,905
everything just...

662
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:49,137
slipped away.

663
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:51,646
And I'm sorry.

664
01:10:56,986 --> 01:10:59,318
I just wanted to say that.

665
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:07,191
I'm sorry.

666
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:15,460
The thing is, Josh...

667
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:21,031
you never had to say sorry to me.

668
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:26,607
All you had to do
was say it to yourself.

669
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,943
I would have been there.

670
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:36,724
Hey, you all secure
down there?

671
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,860
Yeah.

672
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:14,885
Why didn't it take it?

673
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:19,129
Well, if you ask me,
I think it's pretty obvious.

674
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,295
After the past couple of hours,

675
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:24,363
it's decided it prefers live bait.

676
01:12:24,406 --> 01:12:25,839
That's not funny.

677
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:27,967
Do I look like I'm joking?

678
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,001
Get down!

679
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:31,945
You stay back.
Stay back!

680
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,210
I saved this last bullet for you, Doyle.

681
01:12:34,249 --> 01:12:36,114
- You son of a bitch.
- You.

682
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:37,812
What about the mask on the body?

683
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:42,948
Wasn't me, mate.

684
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:45,391
Now, how about
we get ourselves a shark?

685
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:48,157
It really is a pretty good idea.

686
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,563
We just need better bait.

687
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:53,432
And this looks pretty tasty, eh, Doyle?

688
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:56,461
Kirby, listen to me.

689
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:58,530
You don't want to do this.

690
01:12:58,574 --> 01:12:59,836
Don't l?

691
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,365
No.

692
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:03,901
What you did earlier
doesn't matter right now.

693
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:07,473
So you let her go and
we can work something out.

694
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:09,108
Shut up, cop.

695
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:11,016
Don't bullshit me.

696
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:14,580
I shot someone.
That's not going away.

697
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:16,614
Now, I'm getting out of here

698
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:18,523
and I'm catching this fucking shark.

699
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:24,292
And whatever happens...
happens.

700
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,164
- Get in there!

701
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:28,692
- Josh, no.
- Anyone thinks about touching her,

702
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:30,500
you go in too.

703
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:44,245
Naomi, here.

704
01:13:48,223 --> 01:13:50,350
You're okay. Okay.

705
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:52,826
So you want to help?

706
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:55,193
You think it needs live bait?

707
01:13:57,966 --> 01:13:59,763
Well...

708
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:07,705
Let's give it what it wants.

709
01:14:54,923 --> 01:14:56,914
Oh, my God.

710
01:14:56,959 --> 01:14:59,086
It's worked.

711
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:01,118
Now let's get out of here.

712
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:11,801
I don't think anyone's coming for us.

713
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:15,768
I think if they were,
they'd be here by now.

714
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:21,214
I don't know.

715
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:24,413
Maybe they're trying

716
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:27,183
and they're just dealing
with the same shit we are.

717
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:37,932
- Bully?

718
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:40,962
Bully!

719
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:43,631
Oh, float over.

720
01:15:43,672 --> 01:15:45,333
No, don't. No.

721
01:15:46,608 --> 01:15:47,870
- Come on, Bully.
- Baby, swim.

722
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:51,938
Grab him quick.

723
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:59,252
Yay. Bully.

724
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:06,918
It's a sign.
I know it is.

725
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:09,123
Yay.

726
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:12,799
You're a good boy.

727
01:16:18,206 --> 01:16:19,764
Get up.

728
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:50,362
It's okay, sweetheart.
Come on.

729
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:02,176
- What are you doing?
- I don't know. Call it a sign.

730
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:10,518
What is that?

731
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:12,527
It's Ryan.

732
01:17:13,528 --> 01:17:15,792
Oh, my God, it's Ryan.

733
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:17,458
I have to go get him.

734
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:22,599
Jaimie, no. Jaimes.

735
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:29,967
Go after her, please.

736
01:17:34,616 --> 01:17:36,743
Josh.

737
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:05,069
I'll be back soon.

738
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:28,935
He's down there.
I know he is.

739
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:31,336
Wait here.

740
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:45,619
Is he there?
Did you see anyone?

741
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:52,583
All right, give mea hand.

742
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:54,618
We have to close this door,

743
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:56,654
so that when we open
the one downstairs,

744
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:58,495
we don't flood the car park.

745
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:23,014
- Jaimie!
- Ryan!

746
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:25,754
- There's a shark. Get out of the water.
- Quick, quick! Go, go!

747
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:28,819
Go, quick!

748
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:34,335
Give me your hand!

749
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:38,262
Come on.

750
01:19:38,306 --> 01:19:39,705
Josh!

751
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:43,506
Come on!

752
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:51,680
It's Dad's car.
There's a gun.

753
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,416
- What?
- There's a gun in the back.

754
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:57,355
Go to the other side.
Get the shark to come to you.

755
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:07,358
Hurry! Come on!

756
01:20:09,437 --> 01:20:11,428
Hurry, quick!

757
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:21,713
Josh, quick! Josh!

758
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:26,011
Come on, quick.
Come on.

759
01:21:16,438 --> 01:21:18,497
No go this side.

760
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:36,617
Make sure everyone's
out of the water, okay?

761
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:12,760
- Dad.
- Jaimes?

762
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:14,694
Jaimie!

763
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:31,843
Get everyone behind the ramp
and out of the water.

764
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,404
You know what you're doing?

765
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:37,246
I'm gonna hook this up

766
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:38,946
and I'm gonna blow us
a way out of here.

767
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:50,764
Hold on!

768
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,359
Is everyone okay?

769
01:23:20,395 --> 01:23:21,828
Yeah.

770
01:23:21,863 --> 01:23:23,694
- Tina!
- Josh!

771
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:31,101
Shit.
Get out of the water!

772
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:44,901
Hit it.

773
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:10,461
Josh.

774
01:26:41,262 --> 01:26:43,526
What are we gonna do now?

775
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,464
Start over.

776
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,075
