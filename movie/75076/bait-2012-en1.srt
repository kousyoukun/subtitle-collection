00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:17,225
Hey, get up.
It's time to check the buoy.

2
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:19,954
Come on, Josh.

3
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,293
Oh, no.

4
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,655
So you regret
proposing to my sister?

5
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,723
What I regret is letting you
plan my engagement party.

6
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:36,561
I know.

7
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:40,225
Here, get this into you.

8
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,425
It's my great-gran's
hangover remedy.

9
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:48,525
Oh--!

10
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:51,532
Smells like shit.

11
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:55,994
Oh, God.

12
00:01:58,132 --> 00:02:00,030
You're spilling it.

13
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:05,324
You know,
once you get past the gag reflex,

14
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:07,957
- it's actually not that bad.
- Yeah.

15
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:11,922
Rory...?

16
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:14,398
I'll check the buoy.

17
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:17,263
Oh, my sister's down the beach.
She wants to show you something.

18
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,060
Looks like it's gonna be
a busy one. Want a hand with that?

19
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:45,894
What, you're actually gonna
get wet today?

20
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,921
Make a bit of a change,
wouldn't it?

21
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:08,796
Hey.

22
00:03:08,832 --> 00:03:11,025
I bet you've never seen
one of these.

23
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,396
What is it?

24
00:03:13,832 --> 00:03:15,093
Wow.

25
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,961
Were you looking at my butt?

26
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:23,488
No.

27
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:25,522
- No?
- Maybe.

28
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:45,022
Aww.

29
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:48,255
You look terrible.

30
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,197
Thanks.
It's your brother's fault.

31
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,756
But you smell nice.

32
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,629
You always smell nice.

33
00:04:34,132 --> 00:04:36,257
Are you ready
to leave all this behind?

34
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:40,088
Where you go, I go.

35
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:44,022
Well, there won't be places like this
in Singapore.

36
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:46,896
Oh, we'll come back.

37
00:05:16,132 --> 00:05:17,291
Shit.

38
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,958
Shark! Shark!

39
00:05:29,932 --> 00:05:32,693
Get help!

40
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,392
Go get help!

41
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:35,898
Rory!

42
00:05:37,832 --> 00:05:40,298
Get everyone out of the water!

43
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:43,361
Joe, give me a hand.

44
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:55,459
Rory!

45
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:01,224
No!

46
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:05,427
Rory!

47
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:07,897
- Shark!
- I can't hear you.

48
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:09,864
- Shark!
- What?

49
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:19,690
Give me your hand.

50
00:06:25,932 --> 00:06:27,296
Rory!

51
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,090
I got you. I got you.

52
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:39,195
No.

53
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,665
No!

54
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:04,124
Along with
the yearly southern migration

55
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,223
of the humpback whales
along the East Coast waters,

56
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:10,130
"Surfline" surfing spokesman
Jeff Tripp said

57
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,791
people should be very vigilant
this time of year,

58
00:08:12,832 --> 00:08:15,662
as we've seen large gatherings
of sharks in the waters

59
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:17,597
following the whales
along the coast.

60
00:08:17,632 --> 00:08:18,996
Now, what they're doing

61
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,396
is hunting the whale calves

62
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,263
and bait fish
surrounding the migration.

63
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:34,955
So if you are heading
to the beaches,

64
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:37,794
please observe the signs
and swim only between the flags.

65
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:41,287
Great whites are expected
in the area over the next month.

66
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,322
And now, on a brighter note,

67
00:08:43,366 --> 00:08:45,923
it's been a picture-perfect day
here on the East Coast

68
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:48,997
with blue skies
as far as the eye can see.

69
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,628
No signs improving

70
00:08:54,665 --> 00:08:56,563
for the sailors
and the windsurfers, however.

71
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:58,724
We seem to be hit
with the doldrums,

72
00:08:58,765 --> 00:09:01,731
which means there are
no surface winds.

73
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:34,097
We gotta move to the car park.

74
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:36,529
Can't stay here.

75
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:01,660
Yes, please.

76
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,058
- Hey.
- Hey.

77
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,156
- Jessup come by yet?
- Not yet. You're safe.

78
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:11,188
Good morning, by the way.

79
00:11:12,365 --> 00:11:14,127
Yeah.

80
00:11:30,632 --> 00:11:33,224
♪ Shake your body ♪

81
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:35,959
♪ Shake your body ♪

82
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:37,658
♪ Shake your booty... ♪

83
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:41,190
Why are we stopping here?

84
00:11:43,132 --> 00:11:45,563
- Hey, Kyle.
- Shh.

85
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:55,229
You're bad.

86
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:57,356
Hey.

87
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:02,424
Shut up.

88
00:12:25,099 --> 00:12:27,257
What are you doing here?

89
00:12:33,298 --> 00:12:35,764
You scared me.

90
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:41,554
Happy anniversary.

91
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,326
You remembered.

92
00:12:43,365 --> 00:12:46,196
11 months, baby.

93
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:49,858
It's not very much. It's just a song
playlist for when we go to Sydney.

94
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:52,364
Thank you. Thank you.

95
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:55,330
Ooh, and...

96
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:58,559
happy anniversary
to you too.

97
00:13:01,632 --> 00:13:04,996
- Tell me you didn't steal these.
- Oh, Ryan.

98
00:13:05,032 --> 00:13:07,259
Yeah, okay, okay,
put them back.

99
00:13:07,298 --> 00:13:09,628
But then I have
nothing to give you.

100
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,290
Doesn't matter.
It's the thought that counts.

101
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,992
Put them back, okay?

102
00:13:14,032 --> 00:13:15,191
Come on.

103
00:13:15,232 --> 00:13:17,858
Oops, I hope we're not
interrupting anything.

104
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,962
You know, that's a really
cool jacket.

105
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:22,294
Thanks.

106
00:13:22,332 --> 00:13:26,765
Bet it's got lots of pockets, huh?
Mind if we take a little peek?

107
00:13:32,532 --> 00:13:33,964
She's gonna pay for it.

108
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:35,726
Just take it out of my paycheck
if you don't believe me.

109
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:37,890
Paycheck?

110
00:13:37,932 --> 00:13:40,125
You're living
in a dream world, kid.

111
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,688
You're fired.

112
00:13:41,732 --> 00:13:45,789
And you-- shoplifting,
destruction of property.

113
00:13:45,832 --> 00:13:47,695
I've already called the cops.

114
00:13:49,365 --> 00:13:51,354
Did you see all those birds
this morning?

115
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:53,728
There must have been
thousands.

116
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:57,095
You know, there were crows
and magpies and everything.

117
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,526
When did you get back?

118
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:16,529
Tina, this is what you want?

119
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:20,525
Josh, this is--

120
00:14:20,565 --> 00:14:22,895
Oh, Jesus.
Josh, look at you.

121
00:14:22,932 --> 00:14:24,397
Go clean yourself up.

122
00:14:27,265 --> 00:14:30,288
No, not the customer bathroom.

123
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,790
I got the call.

124
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:57,963
Oh, shit.

125
00:15:04,332 --> 00:15:06,321
Whoa! Hello.

126
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:13,394
You starting to hear something

127
00:15:13,432 --> 00:15:15,421
stirring around
that head of yours?

128
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:21,728
The office is at the back
of the store.

129
00:15:21,765 --> 00:15:26,061
Cash pickup's in 10 minutes,
so you've got five to get out.

130
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:31,429
When this is done,

131
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:33,829
we're straight.

132
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:36,729
My brother's clean

133
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:39,526
and I don't want to ever see
your face around him again.

134
00:15:40,632 --> 00:15:42,291
You understand me?

135
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:45,494
Whatever you say.

136
00:16:13,966 --> 00:16:15,989
I want her charged
this time.

137
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:24,061
She didn't steal this.

138
00:16:25,565 --> 00:16:27,224
This is hers.

139
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:33,822
We both know you're not gonna
go through with it.

140
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:36,423
Just stop,
because I'm this close.

141
00:16:36,465 --> 00:16:38,727
To what?
Arresting me?

142
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,697
Yeah, real A-plus
parenting, Dad.

143
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:42,823
- Jaimie, you're too smart to--
- Oh, you just dropped

144
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:45,093
to a C-minus
due to lack of originality.

145
00:16:45,131 --> 00:16:46,825
Okay, okay, what about this?

146
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:49,855
I'm gonna process you
this time.

147
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:51,728
You can spend the day
in lockup.

148
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:53,355
And what do you think
that's gonna do?

149
00:16:53,398 --> 00:16:56,125
Maybe it's the wake-up call
you need.

150
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:03,754
Piss off.

151
00:17:04,998 --> 00:17:07,726
What do you think your mother
would have thought about all of this?

152
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:10,060
Piss off!

153
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:46,488
Put that on.
That's it.

154
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:49,959
- Thanks.
- Great.

155
00:18:16,298 --> 00:18:18,287
What the--?

156
00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:22,625
Give me the money.

157
00:18:22,665 --> 00:18:24,858
Shit, man, there's no money
in the safe.

158
00:18:29,931 --> 00:18:31,954
Give me the money.

159
00:18:31,998 --> 00:18:34,294
All right, just--
just take it easy, okay?

160
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:51,994
You see?

161
00:18:56,298 --> 00:18:58,355
Where is it?

162
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:02,156
Do you want
a separate bag for that?

163
00:19:41,499 --> 00:19:44,192
Hey, drop that fucking gun...

164
00:19:44,232 --> 00:19:46,323
...or I'll do this bitch!

165
00:19:46,365 --> 00:19:47,830
Where's the money?

166
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:50,956
You-- I said,
put the guns down!

167
00:19:50,998 --> 00:19:53,226
Put 'em down!

168
00:20:08,532 --> 00:20:10,259
Thank you.

169
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:13,993
My dad was totally--

170
00:20:14,031 --> 00:20:16,088
Your dad's right, Jaimes.

171
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,358
Not you too.

172
00:20:17,398 --> 00:20:19,886
I lost my job today
because of you.

173
00:20:19,931 --> 00:20:22,227
Who cares?
You hated that job anyway.

174
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:24,288
I care. I care.

175
00:20:24,332 --> 00:20:26,230
Well, if it's that important
to you,

176
00:20:26,265 --> 00:20:28,060
I'll go get your
stupid job back, then.

177
00:20:28,098 --> 00:20:30,257
- Jaimie, just--
- No. Watch.

178
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:44,322
Oi! Freak boy
from history class, right?

179
00:21:21,432 --> 00:21:23,694
You, get here.

180
00:21:23,731 --> 00:21:25,595
- Get here.
- No.

181
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,530
You, get over there.
Stay back.

182
00:21:27,565 --> 00:21:29,030
- No.
- Stay back.

183
00:21:29,065 --> 00:21:30,588
Do as you're told.

184
00:21:30,632 --> 00:21:32,722
What the fuck did you do?

185
00:21:32,764 --> 00:21:34,787
Josh.

186
00:21:34,831 --> 00:21:36,491
Get back.

187
00:21:36,532 --> 00:21:38,521
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

188
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:41,588
Don't be a hero, mate.
Stay back.

189
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:42,756
Tina.

190
00:21:43,764 --> 00:21:45,025
No!

191
00:21:45,065 --> 00:21:46,758
Stop it.

192
00:21:49,532 --> 00:21:51,521
What was that?

193
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:57,624
What--?

194
00:21:57,665 --> 00:21:59,892
Down! Down!

195
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:05,060
Come on.

196
00:22:07,232 --> 00:22:09,925
Oh.

197
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:47,463
I should know,
I built the store.

198
00:22:56,865 --> 00:22:59,195
Hurry up. This way.

199
00:22:59,232 --> 00:23:01,095
Come on, come on!

200
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:05,491
Go! Run!

201
00:24:33,531 --> 00:24:35,520
Hey!

202
00:24:35,564 --> 00:24:36,996
Over here!

203
00:24:39,198 --> 00:24:41,255
Have you seen anyone?

204
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:46,397
Anyone else?
Anyone?

205
00:24:49,232 --> 00:24:51,857
I need help.

206
00:24:51,898 --> 00:24:54,262
Anybody?

207
00:24:54,298 --> 00:24:56,127
Help!

208
00:24:56,165 --> 00:24:57,755
- Hey.
- Here.

209
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:00,753
Where's Tina?

210
00:25:01,764 --> 00:25:03,424
Where's Tina?

211
00:25:03,465 --> 00:25:05,454
Jesus Christ.

212
00:25:05,498 --> 00:25:07,487
Can you help him?
I don't know what to do.

213
00:25:07,531 --> 00:25:08,963
- Just calm down.
- Can you help him?

214
00:25:08,998 --> 00:25:10,896
Calm down.

215
00:25:10,931 --> 00:25:13,795
What the hell's happening?
What just happened?

216
00:25:13,831 --> 00:25:15,558
We gotta get him
out of the water.

217
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,587
Help me lift him
onto this shelf.

218
00:25:29,698 --> 00:25:32,664
I need you to go and find
anything you can to wrap this leg--

219
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,687
towels, electrical tape--
I don't care.

220
00:25:34,731 --> 00:25:36,061
Okay.

221
00:25:39,165 --> 00:25:41,630
Dad? Dad!

222
00:25:43,065 --> 00:25:45,462
My God. Jaimie!

223
00:25:45,498 --> 00:25:47,487
Dad?

224
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:50,258
- Jaimie.
- Dad!

225
00:25:54,298 --> 00:25:56,287
Here, give me your hand.

226
00:26:00,631 --> 00:26:01,858
Jaimie.

227
00:26:01,898 --> 00:26:03,023
Da--

228
00:26:04,065 --> 00:26:05,826
Dad.

229
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:11,886
How did you get out?

230
00:26:11,931 --> 00:26:13,658
I was in the car.

231
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:15,324
I was in the car park, and...

232
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,331
Ryan-- Ryan--

233
00:26:18,365 --> 00:26:20,557
Oh, my God.

234
00:26:20,598 --> 00:26:23,394
Oh, my God,
Ryan's still in the car park.

235
00:26:23,431 --> 00:26:25,522
- Forget it, kid.
- Ryan's still in the car park.

236
00:26:25,564 --> 00:26:27,427
Forget it.

237
00:26:27,464 --> 00:26:29,726
If it's flooded up here,

238
00:26:29,764 --> 00:26:32,423
they've had it down there.

239
00:27:04,397 --> 00:27:05,693
Tina?

240
00:27:07,631 --> 00:27:09,392
Tina!

241
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:14,492
Okay, I need your help.

242
00:27:14,531 --> 00:27:17,191
I need you to help
your dad, okay?

243
00:27:17,232 --> 00:27:19,857
Put your hands here
and keep pressure on his leg.

244
00:27:19,898 --> 00:27:21,864
Can you do that for me?

245
00:27:21,898 --> 00:27:23,386
You'll be fine.

246
00:27:23,431 --> 00:27:24,920
Tina.

247
00:27:31,464 --> 00:27:35,090
Tina. Hey.

248
00:27:36,998 --> 00:27:38,987
You're okay.

249
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:41,088
Look at me.

250
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:43,120
You're okay.

251
00:27:43,165 --> 00:27:45,426
What-- what happened?

252
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:47,124
Where are all the people?

253
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,494
Hey, come on.

254
00:28:30,498 --> 00:28:32,987
Here, give me your hand.

255
00:29:18,764 --> 00:29:21,821
- Help me. Help me.
- Okay, okay.

256
00:29:21,865 --> 00:29:24,228
- Help me.
- Calm down. Calm down.

257
00:29:43,598 --> 00:29:45,587
Help!
We're trapped!

258
00:29:45,631 --> 00:29:47,961
- Someone get us out of here!
- Is anyone there?

259
00:29:47,998 --> 00:29:49,987
- Anyone? Anyone?
- Help!

260
00:29:50,031 --> 00:29:52,428
Somebody help us, please.

261
00:29:54,031 --> 00:29:56,360
Did you hear that?

262
00:29:56,397 --> 00:29:59,023
- Did you hear that?
- Shh. Stop talking.

263
00:30:05,065 --> 00:30:06,655
Where did it go?
Do you hear it?

264
00:30:06,698 --> 00:30:08,425
Not when you don't
shut up.

265
00:30:08,464 --> 00:30:11,658
Well, excuse me
for helping, Kyle, really.

266
00:30:12,931 --> 00:30:14,988
It's behind you.
It's behind you.

267
00:30:15,031 --> 00:30:17,360
Yeah, you find that noise.
You find it.

268
00:30:17,397 --> 00:30:19,295
Good boy, Bully.
Good boy.

269
00:30:34,397 --> 00:30:35,590
Shit.

270
00:30:35,631 --> 00:30:38,495
Fuck. Fuck.

271
00:30:58,364 --> 00:30:59,887
Fuck.

272
00:31:40,998 --> 00:31:42,987
Can anybody hear me?

273
00:31:45,698 --> 00:31:47,687
Hello?

274
00:31:57,364 --> 00:31:59,296
Is anybody there?

275
00:32:00,297 --> 00:32:02,456
Oh, fuck.

276
00:32:06,764 --> 00:32:08,025
Oh.

277
00:32:09,564 --> 00:32:12,894
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

278
00:33:00,097 --> 00:33:01,757
Are you ready?

279
00:33:10,297 --> 00:33:12,593
We've got to get out of here.

280
00:33:12,631 --> 00:33:14,620
We can't stay here.
We've got to get help.

281
00:33:15,631 --> 00:33:17,688
What--?

282
00:33:17,731 --> 00:33:20,253
Oh, shit.

283
00:33:29,598 --> 00:33:31,995
Don't let him
out of your sight.

284
00:33:39,997 --> 00:33:42,225
The water's still rising.

285
00:33:42,264 --> 00:33:43,753
No, no, it can't be.

286
00:33:43,798 --> 00:33:45,855
The whole bloody town
must be flooded up there.

287
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:48,659
No, it's not.
Look, they're gonna come for us.

288
00:33:48,698 --> 00:33:50,926
They know we're down here.
They're gonna come for us.

289
00:33:50,964 --> 00:33:53,226
That's assuming there's
someone still up there to come.

290
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:56,253
- You, this is all your fault.
- Not mine, boy, not today.

291
00:33:56,297 --> 00:33:59,627
Today Mother Nature saw us all
as sinners down here.

292
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:01,721
Why don't you just shut up?

293
00:34:01,764 --> 00:34:03,956
He can't swim anywhere
with this leg.

294
00:34:06,865 --> 00:34:08,455
I'll stay here.

295
00:34:08,498 --> 00:34:11,020
You guys find a way out
and bring a rescue team back.

296
00:34:11,064 --> 00:34:12,860
What? No, Josh, wait.

297
00:34:12,898 --> 00:34:14,864
Well, how do we get out?

298
00:34:14,898 --> 00:34:18,830
With the car park flooded,
that leaves only

299
00:34:18,865 --> 00:34:21,194
the loading bay storeroom
and the front entrance.

300
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:24,322
Josh, you cannot stay here, okay?
You know as well as I do

301
00:34:24,364 --> 00:34:26,592
this is gonna bring aftershocks with it.
It's gonna bring more--

302
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,994
More waves, I know.

303
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,292
So you'll have to be quick.

304
00:34:36,297 --> 00:34:38,889
Okay, well, Steven and I
will check the front.

305
00:34:54,598 --> 00:34:56,826
I'll take the loading bay.

306
00:34:56,865 --> 00:34:58,262
I don't think so.

307
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:02,388
- Bob?
- Yep.

308
00:35:02,431 --> 00:35:03,761
You go.

309
00:35:05,997 --> 00:35:07,293
Okay.

310
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,123
Oh, you've got to be
kidding me.

311
00:35:40,164 --> 00:35:42,460
How could you not have
charged your phone?

312
00:35:42,498 --> 00:35:45,430
I can't do everything, Kyle.
God, why didn't you charge it?

313
00:35:45,464 --> 00:35:47,453
Uh, because it's not
my phone.

314
00:35:47,498 --> 00:35:49,986
Oh, well, then where is your phone?
Hello.

315
00:35:55,731 --> 00:35:57,889
Oh, well, that's much better.

316
00:35:58,897 --> 00:36:00,954
What is it, Bully?

317
00:36:00,997 --> 00:36:02,520
Why are you growling
like that?

318
00:36:02,564 --> 00:36:04,427
Because he's
a fucking retard.

319
00:36:04,464 --> 00:36:07,726
That is not funny, Kyle.
You're not a retard, Bully.

320
00:36:13,864 --> 00:36:16,194
What the hell was that?

321
00:36:16,231 --> 00:36:18,424
I have no idea.

322
00:37:17,097 --> 00:37:18,824
What's that?

323
00:37:24,097 --> 00:37:25,824
Where did it go?

324
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,789
Get everyone
out of the water.

325
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,057
What?

326
00:37:38,097 --> 00:37:40,154
Get everyone
out of the water now!

327
00:37:40,197 --> 00:37:41,595
What's happening?

328
00:37:41,631 --> 00:37:44,188
Tina!
Out of the water now!

329
00:37:44,231 --> 00:37:46,060
- Can't get out that way.
- Hurry!

330
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,790
It's blocked.

331
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,387
Out of the water!

332
00:37:49,431 --> 00:37:50,987
Quick, swim.

333
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:53,019
What's going on?

334
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:54,723
Tina, Steven,
get out of the water!

335
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,725
Collins?

336
00:38:00,231 --> 00:38:02,493
Tina, hurry!

337
00:38:06,064 --> 00:38:08,462
Where is he?
Where did he go?

338
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,987
- Oh!
- Shit.

339
00:38:24,598 --> 00:38:26,461
Jaimie, get back.

340
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:34,928
Help me!
Please help me!

341
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:36,453
Help me!

342
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:01,759
Shit.

343
00:39:03,997 --> 00:39:07,861
Where did it go?
Did you see it?

344
00:39:07,897 --> 00:39:10,022
What the hell could do that?
What is in here?

345
00:39:11,197 --> 00:39:12,254
There.

346
00:39:25,231 --> 00:39:27,390
Give me your hand.

347
00:39:29,064 --> 00:39:31,859
Ow, my hand.

348
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,789
Jesus Christ.

349
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,789
- That had to be five feet.
- What had to be five feet?

350
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:42,388
- Six.
- Six? What do you mean, six?

351
00:39:42,431 --> 00:39:45,397
Six feet from the tip
of the dorsal to the tip of the tail.

352
00:39:45,431 --> 00:39:47,488
So what the hell
does that mean?

353
00:39:48,531 --> 00:39:50,996
It means there's a 12-foot
great white shark in here.

354
00:40:49,264 --> 00:40:51,253
Fuck!

355
00:41:05,064 --> 00:41:07,496
- I can't see anything.
- Just keep calm, babe.

356
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,655
We have to get out of this car.
I can't stay here much longer.

357
00:41:13,464 --> 00:41:15,725
Give me your shoes.

358
00:41:15,763 --> 00:41:16,922
Excuse me?

359
00:41:16,964 --> 00:41:19,555
Well, I need something with a point
to break the windscreen.

360
00:41:19,597 --> 00:41:21,359
Give me your shoes.

361
00:41:21,397 --> 00:41:23,295
Are you crazy?
These are $300 Gucci.

362
00:41:23,331 --> 00:41:25,229
They're gonna get wet anyway.
Just give me your shoes.

363
00:41:25,264 --> 00:41:26,854
- No.
- Heather, give--

364
00:41:26,897 --> 00:41:29,489
I'm not giving you my Gucci.

365
00:41:32,264 --> 00:41:34,253
They're not Gucci.

366
00:41:34,297 --> 00:41:38,161
Um, clue-- you gave them to me
for Christmas last year,

367
00:41:38,197 --> 00:41:40,060
and you said that they were
$300 Guccis.

368
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:43,029
Um, clue-- I know I did,
and they're not.

369
00:41:45,431 --> 00:41:46,919
You bought me fake Gucci.

370
00:41:46,964 --> 00:41:48,486
You wouldn't have known
if I didn't just tell you.

371
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:51,553
I can't believe you.
Fake Gucci?

372
00:41:51,597 --> 00:41:53,722
Just give me your shoes.

373
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,790
What are you doing?

374
00:42:11,497 --> 00:42:14,055
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

375
00:42:16,864 --> 00:42:19,921
Hey! Hey, over here.

376
00:42:19,964 --> 00:42:22,260
Freak boy? Is that you?

377
00:42:22,297 --> 00:42:25,456
Jesus Christ, I never thought
I'd actually be happy to see you.

378
00:42:25,497 --> 00:42:28,328
Yeah, no shit. Did you find
anyone? Is there anyone else?

379
00:42:28,364 --> 00:42:30,454
There's bodies everywhere.
There's no one alive.

380
00:42:30,497 --> 00:42:33,225
Well, did you check
the ramp?

381
00:42:33,264 --> 00:42:35,355
It's all jammed up.
I can't get through.

382
00:42:35,397 --> 00:42:38,192
You got a phone
or something in there?

383
00:42:38,231 --> 00:42:40,390
Uh, no.

384
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:43,056
Holy shit, Kyle. Kyle!

385
00:42:43,097 --> 00:42:45,086
What? What?

386
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:47,028
Oh, Jesus Christ.

387
00:42:48,197 --> 00:42:49,856
Oh, shit.

388
00:43:01,064 --> 00:43:03,360
It's okay.

389
00:43:03,397 --> 00:43:06,022
I think it's gone.

390
00:43:06,064 --> 00:43:07,427
Oh, shit.

391
00:43:12,264 --> 00:43:14,593
Oh, man,
this is not happening.

392
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,596
This is so not happening.

393
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,858
You-- you're a cop, right?

394
00:43:18,897 --> 00:43:21,295
You gotta do something.

395
00:43:21,331 --> 00:43:23,421
For Christ sakes, do something.

396
00:43:23,463 --> 00:43:25,793
Do you have any ideas?

397
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:28,058
Oh, you think
this is funny, do you?

398
00:43:28,097 --> 00:43:30,824
- More ironic, really.
- Oh, really? Well, please share.

399
00:43:30,864 --> 00:43:34,455
I'm sure we could all do
with a good ironic laugh right now.

400
00:43:34,497 --> 00:43:36,486
Think about it.

401
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,655
You bust your ass in here
eight hours a day, seven days a week.

402
00:43:39,697 --> 00:43:41,357
Right?

403
00:43:41,396 --> 00:43:44,056
You'll probably hump away like that
for the next 40 years.

404
00:43:46,463 --> 00:43:49,793
So whatever way you cut it,
this place was gonna kill you.

405
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:52,591
Now it's just sooner
rather than later.

406
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,926
You son of a bitch.

407
00:43:54,964 --> 00:43:57,294
I want you to know,

408
00:43:57,331 --> 00:44:01,093
the woman you killed--
her name was Julie

409
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:03,221
and she was a friend.

410
00:44:03,264 --> 00:44:05,253
- I didn't kill anyone.
- It makes no difference.

411
00:44:05,297 --> 00:44:07,819
She died during your robbery,
so it's your fault, you bastard.

412
00:44:07,864 --> 00:44:10,160
If we get out of here alive, I swear
I'm gonna make you fucking pay.

413
00:44:10,197 --> 00:44:12,322
Enough!

414
00:44:15,597 --> 00:44:17,586
It's coming back.

415
00:44:19,363 --> 00:44:21,556
Why does it keep doing that--
just circling?

416
00:44:21,597 --> 00:44:23,586
Because it's not sure
what we are.

417
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:25,357
It's curious.

418
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:26,885
Curious about what?

419
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:30,226
A shark's only curious
about one thing.

420
00:44:30,264 --> 00:44:32,855
It's trying to decide
if we're food or not.

421
00:44:38,697 --> 00:44:41,061
- What was that?
- Hang on, everybody.

422
00:44:41,097 --> 00:44:43,494
Just hang on.

423
00:44:55,563 --> 00:44:57,189
We have another problem.

424
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,423
Why are you laughing?

425
00:45:03,463 --> 00:45:05,395
'Cause he just realized
when the water hits those cables,

426
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:07,692
this whole place will light up
like a Christmas tree.

427
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:10,719
Jessup, where do we
shut it down?

428
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:17,455
The storage room.

429
00:45:17,497 --> 00:45:19,929
All the power mains
are in the storage room.

430
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:24,618
I'll go.

431
00:45:24,663 --> 00:45:26,993
- What?
- Everyone go to the end of the shelf,

432
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:29,621
make as much noise
as you can.

433
00:45:29,663 --> 00:45:31,152
I'll swim for it.

434
00:45:31,197 --> 00:45:32,628
Josh, no.

435
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:35,493
I mean, you can't.
Your arm-- look at your arm.

436
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:37,689
I mean, the shark will go
straight for you.

437
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:40,094
You can't, not with that.

438
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:42,391
I don't think we have
any other options.

439
00:45:49,097 --> 00:45:50,460
Hold on.

440
00:45:52,964 --> 00:45:54,953
I have an idea.

441
00:46:02,363 --> 00:46:04,091
Do you see it anywhere?

442
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:06,220
Yeah, I see it, but I'm keeping it
a secret from you

443
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,889
because I want you
to be surprised.

444
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,123
Oh, well, thank you for your
thoughtfulness, Kyle, really.

445
00:46:10,164 --> 00:46:12,288
It's what I always dreamed of
in a boyfriend.

446
00:46:15,463 --> 00:46:18,157
Oh, I can't handle this
much longer.

447
00:46:18,197 --> 00:46:20,095
It may surprise you,
but I am not equipped

448
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:22,028
to deal with this kind
of situation.

449
00:46:22,064 --> 00:46:25,518
Here, Bully,
I need some space.

450
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:33,293
Kyle, do something.
You have to do something.

451
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,455
Like what?
Ask the fucking thing to go away?

452
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:38,053
Oh, shit.

453
00:46:38,097 --> 00:46:41,392
- Help!
- Help us, please! Help us!

454
00:46:43,296 --> 00:46:44,819
Get down. Get down.
Get down.

455
00:46:50,263 --> 00:46:52,388
Help us!
Do something!

456
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:54,726
- Okay.
- Help us!

457
00:47:00,763 --> 00:47:03,228
All right, just get back
in the car.

458
00:47:03,263 --> 00:47:05,354
Just stay as still and quiet
as possible.

459
00:47:05,396 --> 00:47:07,624
- What, are you fucking insane?
- Just listen, listen.

460
00:47:07,663 --> 00:47:09,595
Why don't you jump in the water
and do a couple of laps?

461
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,357
All right, just listen to me.
You gotta keep still, okay?

462
00:47:11,396 --> 00:47:13,624
The more you scream,
the more the shark's gonna come.

463
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:16,356
Hey, hey, just get back in
and wait.

464
00:47:16,396 --> 00:47:18,157
I'm gonna get the shark
to come to me.

465
00:47:18,196 --> 00:47:19,628
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What?

466
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:23,219
When I get it over here,
you swim like hell

467
00:47:23,263 --> 00:47:25,695
for my van over there.
You see it?

468
00:47:28,964 --> 00:47:30,953
This is crazy.

469
00:47:36,663 --> 00:47:38,390
Babe, look at me.

470
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:41,157
Don't move.

471
00:47:41,196 --> 00:47:44,287
Stay here as still as you can.
Can you do that?

472
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:03,089
You think this will work?

473
00:48:03,129 --> 00:48:04,993
Absolutely.

474
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:08,587
I wouldn't eat a cheeseburger
with its wrapping on.

475
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:10,459
But of course...

476
00:48:10,497 --> 00:48:12,486
I'm not a shark.

477
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:17,628
Here.

478
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:19,652
Yeah.

479
00:48:31,463 --> 00:48:33,452
Look...

480
00:48:35,196 --> 00:48:37,458
you don't know me...

481
00:48:39,797 --> 00:48:42,558
- but when Tina came to Singapore--
- I don't want to know about it.

482
00:48:42,597 --> 00:48:44,529
Well, you should.

483
00:48:47,897 --> 00:48:49,886
We were never--

484
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,887
The whole time she was there...

485
00:48:58,196 --> 00:49:00,662
she missed you.

486
00:49:02,864 --> 00:49:04,853
It wasn't your fault--

487
00:49:04,897 --> 00:49:07,294
what happened.

488
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,586
That's what she said.

489
00:49:12,263 --> 00:49:15,286
Hey, I found some water.

490
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,421
Good?

491
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:31,120
You come back, okay?

492
00:49:33,196 --> 00:49:35,924
Just come back.

493
00:49:45,563 --> 00:49:46,722
Ready?

494
00:49:49,096 --> 00:49:50,585
Here you go.

495
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:18,753
Oh, shit.

496
00:52:47,663 --> 00:52:50,060
Oh, man, he's not
gonna make it.

497
00:53:11,963 --> 00:53:13,952
He did it.

498
00:53:15,396 --> 00:53:17,225
- He did it.
- Where is he, Josh?

499
00:54:02,896 --> 00:54:04,885
No!

500
00:54:07,096 --> 00:54:08,755
No.

501
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:12,961
Fuck it. No!

502
00:54:36,829 --> 00:54:40,227
Hey... are you okay?

503
00:54:43,563 --> 00:54:46,222
Look,

504
00:54:46,263 --> 00:54:48,491
we've got to try
to keep it together.

505
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:50,519
Okay?

506
00:54:54,796 --> 00:54:56,921
I know. I just--

507
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:03,285
When's it gonna end?

508
00:55:07,029 --> 00:55:09,018
And why is this happening?

509
00:55:12,597 --> 00:55:14,563
Why?

510
00:55:17,863 --> 00:55:21,318
When my mom was dying--

511
00:55:21,363 --> 00:55:24,488
she died two years ago--

512
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:27,655
she was so sick.

513
00:55:29,696 --> 00:55:32,162
I tried.

514
00:55:34,662 --> 00:55:38,186
A couple of months
before she died, I left.

515
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:40,423
I couldn't take it.

516
00:55:40,463 --> 00:55:42,928
I just took off to America.

517
00:55:42,963 --> 00:55:45,191
And...

518
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:47,718
I wasn't there

519
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:49,751
when...

520
00:55:54,662 --> 00:55:58,254
So this is my payback.

521
00:55:58,296 --> 00:56:00,285
Life saying, "Screw you.

522
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:03,952
How are you gonna
run away from this?"

523
00:56:19,096 --> 00:56:21,085
Here.

524
00:56:21,129 --> 00:56:23,357
There's a secret to it.

525
00:56:24,597 --> 00:56:26,619
You have to do it gently.

526
00:56:26,662 --> 00:56:29,822
Just peel the two
pieces of plastic apart

527
00:56:29,863 --> 00:56:31,852
Like that.

528
00:56:32,996 --> 00:56:34,894
Thanks.

529
00:56:37,563 --> 00:56:40,653
Was she a friend of yours--
the girl that got killed?

530
00:56:40,696 --> 00:56:43,924
Julie?

531
00:56:43,963 --> 00:56:45,952
No, not really.

532
00:56:45,996 --> 00:56:49,053
I mean, I knew her
and everything, but--

533
00:56:52,563 --> 00:56:56,518
It was just supposed
to be me, you know?

534
00:56:56,563 --> 00:56:58,552
A quick in and out.
Nobody else, just me.

535
00:57:00,363 --> 00:57:02,760
I guess it's true what they say--

536
00:57:02,796 --> 00:57:04,785
"Let the devil take your hand

537
00:57:04,829 --> 00:57:06,761
and God will make you pay."

538
00:57:09,996 --> 00:57:12,428
We're not gonna make it
out of here, are we?

539
00:57:12,463 --> 00:57:15,190
I don't believe that.

540
00:57:17,396 --> 00:57:19,385
No.

541
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:22,519
We'll make it out of here.

542
00:57:24,896 --> 00:57:26,725
Good.

543
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:22,658
Oh, shit, it's working.
It's working.

544
00:58:22,696 --> 00:58:24,559
Go now.
Go, go now, now.

545
00:58:24,596 --> 00:58:26,085
Come on, go, go, go.

546
00:58:27,096 --> 00:58:29,028
Fuck! Swim!

547
00:58:30,129 --> 00:58:32,288
- Swim!
- Climb! Just climb!

548
00:58:34,896 --> 00:58:36,885
Sorry, Bully.

549
00:58:37,896 --> 00:58:39,555
Fuck!

550
00:58:39,596 --> 00:58:41,755
Stay back!

551
00:58:43,496 --> 00:58:46,019
Bully! Bully!

552
00:58:51,163 --> 00:58:52,560
Fuck!

553
00:59:02,796 --> 00:59:05,194
You need to
slide it through...

554
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:07,355
not fling it.

555
00:59:21,896 --> 00:59:24,487
It's strong, but it can't
take much weight.

556
00:59:29,296 --> 00:59:31,761
Screw this.
I'm out of here.

557
00:59:45,096 --> 00:59:47,653
If you can get through,
you get help and bring them back.

558
00:59:47,696 --> 00:59:49,423
Yeah, yeah,
all right, all right.

559
00:59:55,562 --> 00:59:57,926
- Ready?
- Let's go.

560
01:00:11,462 --> 01:00:12,689
Got it?

561
01:00:38,462 --> 01:00:40,928
- Pull him up!
- I can make it. I can make it.

562
01:00:40,963 --> 01:00:43,793
- Pull up now.
- I can make it. I'm okay.

563
01:01:08,129 --> 01:01:09,424
Give me your hand.

564
01:01:31,496 --> 01:01:34,019
Are you gonna talk to me
or what?

565
01:01:34,063 --> 01:01:36,858
No.

566
01:01:36,896 --> 01:01:38,919
- Heather, I didn't--
- Don't.

567
01:01:38,963 --> 01:01:41,622
Don't even try.

568
01:01:41,662 --> 01:01:43,787
Murderer.

569
01:01:47,762 --> 01:01:49,387
I'm not a murderer.

570
01:01:49,429 --> 01:01:51,191
Oh, yes, you are.

571
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:54,889
You're a dog murderer,
which is worse than a person murderer.

572
01:01:55,996 --> 01:01:57,985
How could you?

573
01:01:59,063 --> 01:02:01,120
Heather, I didn't have
a choice.

574
01:02:01,163 --> 01:02:04,152
Bullshit.
You always have a choice.

575
01:02:05,729 --> 01:02:07,991
Murderer.

576
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:13,219
Whatever.

577
01:02:20,762 --> 01:02:22,591
Argh!

578
01:02:25,163 --> 01:02:27,152
Uh!

579
01:02:48,196 --> 01:02:49,957
Hey. Hey.

580
01:02:49,996 --> 01:02:51,985
Can that pipe
hold my weight?

581
01:02:52,029 --> 01:02:55,018
I can't get out this way.
I want to get to that door.

582
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:56,756
What do you think?

583
01:02:56,796 --> 01:02:58,659
I don't know.
Give it a go.

584
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,485
- You all right?
- Yeah.

585
01:03:14,529 --> 01:03:16,518
Can you see it anywhere?

586
01:03:16,562 --> 01:03:18,994
I don't know.
You're the one with the bloody torch.

587
01:03:24,729 --> 01:03:26,524
Shit.

588
01:03:33,629 --> 01:03:35,288
Are you okay?

589
01:03:41,863 --> 01:03:43,385
Whew.

590
01:03:45,329 --> 01:03:47,454
Ooh, Jesus.

591
01:03:49,762 --> 01:03:51,921
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

592
01:03:57,362 --> 01:03:59,624
Good stuff.
Keep going.

593
01:03:59,662 --> 01:04:01,628
Is he gonna make it?

594
01:04:01,662 --> 01:04:03,252
Babe, shut up.

595
01:04:10,462 --> 01:04:11,655
Shit.

596
01:04:16,996 --> 01:04:19,655
You're good. You got,
like, six feet. Keep going.

597
01:04:30,729 --> 01:04:32,388
Oh, shit.
Hold on.

598
01:04:32,429 --> 01:04:33,986
Grab on. Grab on.

599
01:04:34,029 --> 01:04:35,517
Shit.

600
01:04:38,395 --> 01:04:41,452
Swim, swim, swim.
Quick, quick.

601
01:04:43,929 --> 01:04:45,292
- Quick.
- Got you, buddy.

602
01:04:47,429 --> 01:04:49,918
Kyle! No!

603
01:04:49,963 --> 01:04:52,190
- Quick, quick.
- Give me your hand.

604
01:04:57,829 --> 01:04:59,419
Give me your hand!

605
01:05:26,729 --> 01:05:29,025
We're not gonna just
sit around and wait for that thing

606
01:05:29,062 --> 01:05:30,995
to pick us off one by one.

607
01:05:31,029 --> 01:05:32,961
And what do you think
you're gonna do?

608
01:05:32,996 --> 01:05:34,985
At the very least, I'm gonna die
on my own terms

609
01:05:35,029 --> 01:05:36,688
and not when that damn fish
decides it's time.

610
01:05:36,729 --> 01:05:38,991
So you think what?

611
01:05:39,029 --> 01:05:41,221
You're gonna catch it?

612
01:05:44,395 --> 01:05:45,554
Why not?

613
01:05:47,796 --> 01:05:50,057
What are you gonna do
if you catch it?

614
01:05:50,095 --> 01:05:53,255
Spark up the barbie
and crack open the tartare sauce?

615
01:05:53,295 --> 01:05:55,023
I'm gonna tie it to this shelf

616
01:05:55,062 --> 01:05:57,119
and we're gonna swim like hell
to the entrance.

617
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:59,094
Get the hell out of here.

618
01:05:59,128 --> 01:06:01,651
All I need isa hook.

619
01:06:04,729 --> 01:06:06,991
You can't save everybody, mate.

620
01:06:07,028 --> 01:06:09,187
You must be getting used
to that by now.

621
01:06:12,529 --> 01:06:14,518
It's not that far.

622
01:06:15,529 --> 01:06:17,791
If we can distract
the shark,

623
01:06:17,829 --> 01:06:19,294
I'll swim it,

624
01:06:19,329 --> 01:06:21,295
get the hooks.

625
01:06:25,028 --> 01:06:27,017
I'll do it.

626
01:06:27,062 --> 01:06:29,528
What? Dad, no.

627
01:06:29,562 --> 01:06:31,323
Oh, you can't,
not with your leg.

628
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:32,851
My leg is exactly
why I should go.

629
01:06:32,896 --> 01:06:34,418
Dad, no, please.

630
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:37,692
You keep
my daughter safe.

631
01:06:37,729 --> 01:06:39,957
No matter what happens,
you get her out of here, okay?

632
01:06:54,662 --> 01:06:55,821
Jaimie!

633
01:06:57,896 --> 01:06:59,794
Jaimie! Jaimie!

634
01:06:59,829 --> 01:07:02,420
Naomi, make noise,
get the shark to come toward us.

635
01:07:05,262 --> 01:07:07,660
Hurry, quick,
make some noise!

636
01:07:27,295 --> 01:07:29,056
Jaimes, are you okay?

637
01:07:30,329 --> 01:07:31,659
Yeah.

638
01:07:44,462 --> 01:07:45,621
Okay, hang on.

639
01:07:49,995 --> 01:07:51,586
Jump!

640
01:08:06,429 --> 01:08:08,224
Good work, kid.

641
01:08:33,162 --> 01:08:35,151
So what's the deal?

642
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:37,320
Do you know her
or just want to?

643
01:08:40,329 --> 01:08:42,295
I used to.

644
01:08:42,329 --> 01:08:43,988
Used to, huh?

645
01:08:44,028 --> 01:08:46,017
'Cause I can see by that look
in your eye,

646
01:08:46,062 --> 01:08:48,358
whatever was there,
still is.

647
01:08:50,662 --> 01:08:52,525
That was a long time ago.

648
01:09:01,395 --> 01:09:04,725
Trust me,
after this shit here,

649
01:09:04,762 --> 01:09:07,159
everything we knew
is a long time ago.

650
01:09:27,629 --> 01:09:29,856
You still wear that.

651
01:09:35,928 --> 01:09:37,417
Yeah.

652
01:09:44,329 --> 01:09:47,489
- Tina--
- You don't have to.

653
01:09:47,529 --> 01:09:49,858
- We don't have to do this, Josh.
- No, I do.

654
01:09:53,195 --> 01:09:55,320
I wasn't fair to you.

655
01:09:58,162 --> 01:09:59,685
I just--

656
01:10:01,795 --> 01:10:04,227
I always set the buoy.

657
01:10:08,195 --> 01:10:10,525
Rory did it for me that day.

658
01:10:12,762 --> 01:10:14,818
But I should have been
the one out there.

659
01:10:14,862 --> 01:10:16,021
Josh.

660
01:10:16,062 --> 01:10:18,392
And I hated myself.

661
01:10:20,962 --> 01:10:24,224
But...

662
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:27,819
before I knew
what had happened,

663
01:10:27,862 --> 01:10:31,158
everything just...

664
01:10:31,195 --> 01:10:33,388
slipped away.

665
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:35,894
And I'm sorry.

666
01:10:41,229 --> 01:10:43,559
I just wanted to say that.

667
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:51,424
I'm sorry.

668
01:10:57,162 --> 01:10:59,685
The thing is, Josh...

669
01:11:02,761 --> 01:11:05,250
you never had to say
sorry to me.

670
01:11:08,229 --> 01:11:10,820
All you had to do
was say it to yourself.

671
01:11:14,662 --> 01:11:17,150
I would have been there.

672
01:11:18,496 --> 01:11:20,927
Hey, you all secure
down there?

673
01:11:22,162 --> 01:11:24,060
Yeah.

674
01:11:57,562 --> 01:11:59,050
Why didn't it take it?

675
01:12:00,062 --> 01:12:03,290
Well, if you ask me,
I think it's pretty obvious.

676
01:12:03,329 --> 01:12:05,454
After the past
couple of hours,

677
01:12:05,496 --> 01:12:08,519
it's decided it prefers
live bait.

678
01:12:08,562 --> 01:12:09,993
That's not funny.

679
01:12:10,028 --> 01:12:12,119
Do I look like I'm joking?

680
01:12:12,162 --> 01:12:14,151
Get down!

681
01:12:14,195 --> 01:12:16,093
You stay back.
Stay back!

682
01:12:16,128 --> 01:12:18,356
I saved this last bullet
for you, Doyle.

683
01:12:18,395 --> 01:12:20,258
- You son of a bitch.
- You.

684
01:12:20,295 --> 01:12:21,954
What about the mask
on the body?

685
01:12:24,028 --> 01:12:27,085
Wasn't me, mate.

686
01:12:27,128 --> 01:12:29,526
Now, how about
we get ourselves a shark?

687
01:12:29,562 --> 01:12:32,289
It really is
a pretty good idea.

688
01:12:32,329 --> 01:12:34,692
We just need better bait.

689
01:12:34,728 --> 01:12:37,559
And this looks pretty tasty,
eh, Doyle?

690
01:12:37,596 --> 01:12:40,585
Kirby, listen to me.

691
01:12:40,628 --> 01:12:42,651
You don't want to do this.

692
01:12:42,695 --> 01:12:43,956
Don't I?

693
01:12:43,995 --> 01:12:45,484
No.

694
01:12:45,529 --> 01:12:48,017
What you did earlier
doesn't matter right now.

695
01:12:48,062 --> 01:12:51,586
So you let her go
and we can work something out.

696
01:12:51,628 --> 01:12:53,219
Shut up, cop.

697
01:12:53,262 --> 01:12:55,125
Don't bullshit me.

698
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:58,685
I shot someone.
That's not going away.

699
01:12:58,728 --> 01:13:00,717
Now, I'm getting out of here

700
01:13:00,761 --> 01:13:02,624
and I'm catching
this fucking shark.

701
01:13:04,728 --> 01:13:08,388
And whatever happens...
happens.

702
01:13:08,429 --> 01:13:10,258
Get in there!

703
01:13:10,295 --> 01:13:12,783
- Josh, no.
- Anyone thinks about touching her,

704
01:13:12,828 --> 01:13:14,590
you go in too.

705
01:13:27,128 --> 01:13:28,321
Naomi, here.

706
01:13:32,295 --> 01:13:34,420
You're okay. Okay.

707
01:13:34,462 --> 01:13:36,893
So you want to help?

708
01:13:36,928 --> 01:13:39,258
You think it needs live bait?

709
01:13:42,028 --> 01:13:43,823
Well...

710
01:13:49,928 --> 01:13:51,757
Let's give it what it wants.

711
01:14:38,928 --> 01:14:40,917
Oh, my God.

712
01:14:40,962 --> 01:14:43,087
It's worked.

713
01:14:43,128 --> 01:14:45,117
Now let's get out of here.

714
01:14:53,062 --> 01:14:55,789
I don't think
anyone's coming for us.

715
01:14:57,661 --> 01:14:59,752
I think if they were,
they'd be here by now.

716
01:15:02,761 --> 01:15:05,193
I don't know.

717
01:15:05,229 --> 01:15:08,389
Maybe they're trying

718
01:15:08,429 --> 01:15:11,156
and they're just dealing
with the same shit we are.

719
01:15:19,928 --> 01:15:21,894
Bully?

720
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:24,921
Bully!

721
01:15:24,962 --> 01:15:27,587
Oh, float over.

722
01:15:27,628 --> 01:15:29,288
No, don't. No.

723
01:15:30,561 --> 01:15:31,822
- Come on, Bully.
- Baby, swim.

724
01:15:34,795 --> 01:15:35,886
Grab him quick.

725
01:15:39,329 --> 01:15:43,193
Yay. Bully.

726
01:15:47,862 --> 01:15:50,851
It's a sign.
I know it is.

727
01:15:51,895 --> 01:15:53,054
Yay.

728
01:15:54,295 --> 01:15:56,726
You're a good boy.

729
01:16:02,128 --> 01:16:03,684
Get up.

730
01:16:31,229 --> 01:16:34,252
It's okay, sweetheart.
Come on.

731
01:16:43,428 --> 01:16:46,054
- What are you doing?
- I don't know. Call it a sign.

732
01:16:53,229 --> 01:16:54,387
What is that?

733
01:16:54,428 --> 01:16:56,394
It's Ryan.

734
01:16:57,394 --> 01:16:59,656
Oh, my God, it's Ryan.

735
01:16:59,695 --> 01:17:01,321
I have to go get him.

736
01:17:03,695 --> 01:17:06,456
Jaimie, no. Jaimes.

737
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:13,817
Go after her, please.

738
01:17:18,461 --> 01:17:20,586
Josh.

739
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:48,884
I'll be back soon.

740
01:18:09,862 --> 01:18:12,726
He's down there.
I know he is.

741
01:18:12,761 --> 01:18:15,125
Wait here.

742
01:18:26,928 --> 01:18:29,393
Is he there?
Did you see anyone?

743
01:18:34,361 --> 01:18:36,350
All right, give me a hand.

744
01:18:36,394 --> 01:18:38,383
We have to close this door,

745
01:18:38,428 --> 01:18:40,417
so that when we open
the one downstairs,

746
01:18:40,461 --> 01:18:42,257
we don't flood the car park.

747
01:19:04,728 --> 01:19:06,751
- Jaimie!
- Ryan!

748
01:19:06,795 --> 01:19:09,488
- There's a shark. Get out of the water.
- Quick, quick! Go, go!

749
01:19:11,062 --> 01:19:12,550
Go, quick!

750
01:19:16,595 --> 01:19:18,061
Give me your hand!

751
01:19:20,495 --> 01:19:21,984
Come on.

752
01:19:22,028 --> 01:19:23,425
Josh!

753
01:19:24,995 --> 01:19:27,222
Come on!

754
01:19:32,228 --> 01:19:35,388
It's Dad's car.
There's a gun.

755
01:19:35,428 --> 01:19:38,122
- What?
- There's a gun in the back.

756
01:19:39,195 --> 01:19:41,058
Go to the other side.
Get the shark to come to you.

757
01:19:48,062 --> 01:19:51,051
Hurry! Come on!

758
01:19:53,128 --> 01:19:55,117
Hurry, quick!

759
01:20:02,062 --> 01:20:05,391
Josh, quick! Josh!

760
01:20:06,628 --> 01:20:09,685
Come on, quick.
Come on.

761
01:21:00,062 --> 01:21:02,119
No go this side.

762
01:21:18,062 --> 01:21:20,220
Make sure everyone's
out of the water, okay?

763
01:21:53,361 --> 01:21:56,327
- Dad.
- Jaimes?

764
01:21:56,361 --> 01:21:58,259
Jaimie!

765
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:15,391
Get everyone behind the ramp
and out of the water.

766
01:22:15,428 --> 01:22:16,951
You know
what you're doing?

767
01:22:19,028 --> 01:22:20,789
I'm gonna hook this up

768
01:22:20,828 --> 01:22:22,487
and I'm gonna blow us
a way out of here.

769
01:22:32,361 --> 01:22:34,293
Hold on!

770
01:23:02,495 --> 01:23:03,859
Is everyone okay?

771
01:23:03,895 --> 01:23:05,326
Yeah.

772
01:23:05,361 --> 01:23:07,190
- Tina!
- Josh!

773
01:23:12,761 --> 01:23:14,590
Shit.
Get out of the water!

774
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:28,316
Hit it.

775
01:24:51,862 --> 01:24:53,851
Josh.

776
01:26:24,561 --> 01:26:26,822
What are we gonna do now?

777
01:26:28,495 --> 01:26:30,757
