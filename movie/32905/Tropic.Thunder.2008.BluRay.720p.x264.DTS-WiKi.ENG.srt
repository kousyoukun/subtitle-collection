1
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:04,003
Alpa Chino!

2
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:05,754
We're loaded

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,674
I love the pussy, hell, yeah

4
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:11,510
I love that pussy
dripping down to the floor, oh, no

5
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:14,096
The wettest pussy, hell, yeah
I love the pussy, hell, yeah

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,266
I'm drinking up
your Booty Sweat and busting a nut

7
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,184
Alpa Chino got that pussy control

8
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,186
Alpa Chino's Booty Sweat.

9
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,688
Pop an ass open!

10
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:26,275
Booty Sweat and Bust-A-Nut bars
available at concessions now.

11
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:34,533
In 2013, when the Earth's rotation
came to a halt...

12
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:38,203
The President has declared
all of North America a disaster area.

13
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,040
I call on my fellow Americans
to come together...

14
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:45,127
...the world called on the one man
who could make a difference.

15
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:53,260
When it happened again,
the world called on him once more.

16
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,972
And no one saw it coming
three more times!

17
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,730
Now,

18
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:08,734
the one man who made a difference
five times before,

19
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:15,574
is about to make a difference again.

20
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:20,412
Only this time, it's different.

21
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,832
Who left the fridge open?

22
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,252
Tugg Speedman.

23
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:32,091
Scorcher Vl: Global Meltdown.

24
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,967
Here we go again.

25
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,512
Again.

26
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,940
Will there be anything else?

27
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,276
Yes, my dear man. More beans.

28
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,280
Granny!

29
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,367
Please!

30
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:03,455
This summer, America's
favorite obese family is back.

31
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,876
Gross!

32
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,003
- You're just mad 'cause I'm skinny.
- Am not!

33
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:16,301
Jeff Portnoy.

34
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:22,474
And Jeff Portnoy are
The Fatties: Fart Two.

35
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,393
In some countries,

36
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,229
it's considered a compliment.

37
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,566
Letting loose this summer.

38
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:45,581
In a time where to be different
was to be condemned,

39
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:04,057
and to be condemned was to die,

40
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:12,357
one man chose to question his God.

41
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,030
From Fox Searchlight,

42
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:30,125
five-time Academy Award winner
Kirk Lazarus

43
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:35,547
and MTV Movie Award
Best Kiss winner Tobey Maguire.

44
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:46,475
Winner of the Beijing Film Festival's
coveted Crying Monkey Award,

45
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,645
Satan's Alley.

46
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,026
I've been a bad, bad boy, Father.

47
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:35,023
In the winter of 1969,

48
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,109
an elite force of the U.S. Army

49
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:42,114
was sent on a top-secret assignment
in southeast Vietnam.

50
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,950
The objective,
rescue Sergeant Four Leaf Tayback

51
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:48,120
from a heavily guarded
NVA Prison Camp.

52
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,331
The mission was considered
to be near suicide.

53
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,961
Of the 10 men sent, four returned.

54
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,464
Of those four, three wrote books
about what happened.

55
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,551
Of those three, two were published.

56
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,847
Of those two, just one got a movie deal.

57
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:13,562
This is the story of the men
who attempted to make that movie.

58
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,992
Whisky Fire Old Snake
requests an LZ prep

59
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,661
at Alpha-Delta-two-four-eight-niner,
over.

60
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:39,212
Floyd, this is lead. Right echelon
approach from RP to LZ, acknowledge.

61
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,090
Floyd, Wall-Eye airborne.
Welcome aboard.

62
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,679
All right, lead's going in.
Give her some cover.

63
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,599
Delivery on five.
I repeat, delivery on five.

64
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,024
This is Zero-Three.
I'm on your six, don't worry.

65
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,943
Chalk-Three's taking fire.
Guns right, guns right.

66
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,124
Lay that shit down!

67
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,542
Come on!

68
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,713
Come on, you damn dirty heathens!

69
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,801
Fats! Run your motherfucking ass
over there,

70
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,219
hold these men off, now!

71
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,054
We're fixing to lift off!

72
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,723
Put some pep in your step, dick!
Jelly-ass bitch!

73
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,143
Wall-Eye, Wall-Eye,
this is Boomer One-Seven in the Zee!

74
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:39,398
I need fast movers
on my Yankee Smoke, copy?

75
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,900
Boomer, this is Wall-Eye.
I got two-Alpha-four

76
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,236
- snake and nape on the ready!
- Oh, Jesus! Holy shit!

77
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,487
Holy shit!

78
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,406
Get on that horn
and get some firepower, boy!

79
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,448
Jesus Christ!

80
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,699
Listen, you cherry fuck,

81
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,203
you call in that snake and nape
and get us some boom-boom now!

82
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,789
I'd do it myself
but I'm kind of goddamn busy!

83
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,290
I need an answer, Boomer!

84
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,917
Wall-Eye, Wall-Eye!

85
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,752
I copy!

86
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,422
We got beaucoup zips in the zee.

87
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,006
Rock and roll!

88
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,925
What the fuck?

89
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,273
That's for Brooklyn, motherfucker!

90
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,275
I think I can put it back in!

91
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,193
We got to get back to the bird.

92
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,361
Lukemeyer's got popped!

93
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,364
This is the last Christmas
I spend with Victor Charlie up my ass!

94
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,284
Want some? Get some!

95
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,537
Hey, yo, Fats! I ain't seen Four Leaf!

96
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,874
Don't count him out! That bastard's
got luck tattooed to his ass!

97
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,960
Motown, get your Detroit jukebox
Jheri curl ass

98
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,296
in this chickenshit chop-chop! ASAFP!

99
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,214
Four Leaf is still
outside the perimeter, Sarge!

100
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,384
Miss me with that cracker chump jive!
We di di mau! We di di mau!

101
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,136
Come on, Sarge. Stop jiving.
Four Leaf is there.

102
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,971
Dead meat, soldier!

103
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,056
Or do you want to be a hero?

104
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,058
That's just how Brooks
got his Jew ass killed, man.

105
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,895
And Meatball's dago ass
bought the six-by-three farm.

106
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,690
Now get your ass up in the Huey, before
I stomp a trench in your hiney hole!

107
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,651
Come on, get down, get down!

108
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,820
What am I looking at? What is this?

109
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:13,658
Come on, let's get, let's go!
Come on, elevator up, up!

110
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,328
Sarge. It's Four Leaf.

111
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,674
No!

112
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,553
You get out of that hole!

113
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,442
You make it home, now.

114
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,117
Survive!

115
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,968
I hope y'all like hamburger meat.

116
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,136
'Cause that's exactly what
I'm gonna be bringing back

117
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,305
and serving up in this whirly bird.

118
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,891
Cover me, you limp dick fuckups!

119
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,775
Peek-a-boo! I see you!

120
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,487
Hold on, Four Leaf!

121
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,491
Oh, shit!

122
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,834
Watch my right!

123
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,505
Fuck you, Charlie!

124
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,804
Come on, Leaf, let's boogie!

125
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,856
No!

126
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,111
- Fats!
- Holy fuck!

127
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,948
Take us over to those men! Shit!

128
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,372
Look at you, man.
Playing with grenades.

129
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,169
I'm cold, Linc.

130
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,048
I can't feel my legs.

131
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,176
Ain't nothing but a thang.

132
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,056
Hey, Linc.

133
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,391
What, man?

134
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,728
Why does man

135
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,731
got to pick up sticks
against another man?

136
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,235
Instead of using them sticks to

137
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,238
prop a man up?

138
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,990
I'll never know.

139
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,494
Hold my hands,

140
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,412
'cause I got something to...

141
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,414
I got something to say.

142
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,501
Oh, boy.

143
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,341
- You holding 'em?
- I got 'em tight.

144
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,762
When we get back to the world,

145
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,350
we gonna put together that three-piece
combo band we talked about?

146
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,436
- Me on stand-up bass.
- Johnny on drums.

147
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,107
And me tickling the ivories.

148
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,445
I ain't never been worth a nothing
in this life,

149
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,281
but I want you to know something.

150
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,701
What, man?

151
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,912
You are my...

152
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,124
You are my brother.

153
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:07,142
You are my brother.
You are my... You are my...

154
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,935
I am your brother.

155
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,149
I'm sorry. Could we cut?

156
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,734
- What's he saying?
- Damien, can we cut?

157
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,485
- No. No, no, no, no, no...
- All right, you know what?

158
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,655
We got the jets coming in,
big explosion, two minutes.

159
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,823
Still rolling.

160
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,575
You know what? No, not still rolling.
Can we cut?

161
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,326
- We're cutting.
- No, we're not. Get out!

162
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,412
Hey, what's going on?
For real, my butt is hurting!

163
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,330
This harness is riding up my crack!

164
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,167
- Damien, are we cutting?
- No! No! Still rolling!

165
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,419
Mr. Cockburn! Are we cutting, sir?

166
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,672
No! No. I'm not cutting!
We're still rolling!

167
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,840
Damien, what's the dealy, dude?

168
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,759
Are we gonna blow
this tree line or what?

169
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,427
Tuk Tuk and Kim
got the blue balls here.

170
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,762
I'm gonna let them squirt if we're a go!

171
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,097
- Play it through. Still rolling!
- Dieter, can he hear me?

172
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,767
That's C-4, dipshit. Put that back.
I said a detonator.

173
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,269
I need some dudes up here
who speak American, God damn it!

174
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,854
He's making
a fucking sweater back here.

175
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,273
I'm trying to put Tiger Balm
on this jungle's nuts.

176
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,524
Everyone, please shut up.

177
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,777
The jets are coming in.
We only have one chance at this!

178
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,278
And go!

179
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,697
Let's do it. You feel it? You feel me?

180
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,034
- You are my...
- I am your brother.

181
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,369
We've seen it all, man.

182
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,121
I'm sorry, Damien?

183
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,539
Are you seeing that?

184
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,708
The little froggy on the boom mike?
It's right in my eyeline.

185
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,670
Donny! What's up, man?

186
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,297
It's been there the whole show.

187
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,465
Yeah, well it's right in my face,

188
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,633
I'm staring at a frog, I'm trying to feel...

189
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,219
It's always the yellow frog that
brings them black frog on Fridays, man.

190
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,054
Hell, no, I didn't pee on that girl.

191
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,223
No, I didn't pee on her,
listen, listen, listen, listen. No, no.

192
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,892
The story is this. She was in the way
when I was peeing, she walked past.

193
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,311
What the fuck is going on here?

194
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,563
On three, baby. One, two, breathe.

195
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,233
Look, do me a favor. I don't want to do
a countdown before I do the scene.

196
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,400
- No countdown?
- No countdown.

197
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,735
- Okay.
- Can we just do it off of "Action"?

198
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,403
Just... ln your own time.

199
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,239
- Good...
- I'm not a rocket ship, okay?

200
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,990
- All right, dude.
- And action!

201
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,077
Whatever floats your boat, baby.
Fuck! Don't die!

202
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,579
Erika, get me a Vitamin Water!

203
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,164
You know what it is, Damien? I'm sorry.

204
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,669
Not to get into his thing, but if
I'm crying, should Osiris be crying, too?

205
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,671
- No, it's everyone cry...
- We cutting or we crying?

206
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,089
- No, no, no, we're crying!
- Just call it, man!

207
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,341
- Kirk, you can cry. Tugg, you can cry.
- Thanks!

208
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,176
- Everybody cry...
- You know what?

209
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,262
- You see how agitated he is now?
- I know.

210
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,764
- Let's make lemonade. Let's go to work.
- Okay. Still rolling!

211
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,851
This is Falcon One. We have the ridge
in sight, approximately two miles out.

212
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,186
Dieter, these jets
are about to crest this ridge line.

213
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,272
They got about 200 pounds
of shit your pants.

214
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,439
I need to know if we're ready to go.

215
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,444
- You're my... You're my...
- I am your...

216
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,031
See, that's what I think it is, Damien.
I think it's the line.

217
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,116
Yeah?

218
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,118
I don't know if Four Leaf
would say that... Four Leaf?

219
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,537
Were you crying
when your hands blew up?

220
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,289
No. See, he didn't.
Yeah, I mean, just that's what...

221
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,957
So now we in re-writes, right?

222
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,208
- Where you going?
- Let's re-write it!

223
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,460
Action Jackson can't cry.
That's what's going down.

224
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,546
You know what, Kirk?
I'm ready to do the scene!

225
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,216
What scene? The scene is
about emotionality. Where is it?

226
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,885
- Now it's time to flip the script!
- Kirk...

227
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,137
Be here till Chinese New Year
waiting for my man to cry.

228
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,306
You're tangling me,
you're fucking tangling me.

229
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,640
You're tangling me, God damn it!

230
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,560
- Kirk, no!
- Stop tailgating me, you pasty tea bag!

231
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,478
I'm going potty.
You want to hold my dick?

232
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,732
Shit! What are you fucking both doing,
Good Lord!

233
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,401
We're getting this in a wide shot, right?

234
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,069
Of course we're getting it
in a fucking wide.

235
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,195
What, do you think
I'm a dick or something?

236
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,906
Get that fucking food...

237
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,449
Here they come!

238
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,911
- The planes are inbound!
- Shit! Shit!

239
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:17,916
Shit, shit, cocksucker, bollocks.
Tropic tits!

240
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,002
That's the signal! Go, go, go, go, go!

241
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,171
Let's go freaking Tet here!

242
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,298
Goddamn shit-picking cock!

243
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,010
That's my shit!

244
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,477
Mother Nature just pissed her pantsuit!

245
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,444
- Sweet.
- Oh, mama!

246
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,616
Bungle in the jungle.

247
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,869
More bad news from the Vietnamese set
of Tropic Thunder,

248
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,706
where a $4 million explosion
charred the Asian location

249
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,708
and the camera wasn't even rolling.

250
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,544
Financed by hotheaded mega-mogul
Les Grossman,

251
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,714
the film is already rumored to be
one month behind schedule

252
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,717
just five days into shooting.
The reason?

253
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,720
Fingers are pointed at rookie director
Damien Cockburn,

254
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,890
who, insiders say,
can't control a star-studded cast,

255
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:20,728
including flatulent star of the popular
Fatties franchise, Jeff Portnoy.

256
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,398
Let me tell you something.
A lot of people are disrespecting me.

257
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:27,235
They say that the movie's
just about farts. It's about family,

258
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,405
and... you! You can't do what I do.

259
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:34,742
Fresh from his most recent arrest
for heroin, glue and crack possession,

260
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,245
Portnoy was almost uninsurable.

261
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:41,666
Also in the mix is Booty Sweat-hocking
hip-hop hyphenate Alpa Chino.

262
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,252
I'm so excited, you know what I'm
saying, about doing Tropic Thunder.

263
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,504
Hey, drink Booty Sweat, baby.
Drink Booty Sweat.

264
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,256
But the real heavyweight on the set

265
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,092
is five-time Academy Award winner
Kirk Lazarus.

266
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,929
The brilliant Australian
known for his bad boy antics off-screen

267
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,599
is famous for his total immersion
into any role he portrays.

268
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,018
Well, being an actor is no different

269
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,353
than being a rugby player
or a construction worker,

270
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,604
save for the fact that my tools

271
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,773
are the mechanisms
that trigger human emotion.

272
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,942
Lazarus underwent a controversial

273
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,029
pigmentation alteration procedure
in order to play

274
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:14,198
the platoon's African-American
sergeant, Lincoln Osiris.

275
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,783
Yeah!

276
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,702
Trying to hold his own onscreen
with Kirk

277
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,954
is action juggernaut Tugg Speedman.

278
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,874
Once the highest grossing star
in the world,

279
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,044
lately his Scorcher films
have lost their heat.

280
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,713
Recently, Speedman opened up to Tyra.

281
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,798
You have no real family.

282
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:35,303
You're on the wrong side of 40.
You're childless and alone.

283
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,138
Somebody close to you said,

284
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,974
"One more flop and it's over."

285
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,228
Somebody said they were close to me?

286
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,314
It's been a tough year for Tugg.

287
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,150
The disappointing buddy comedy
Chitlin' & the Dude

288
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:53,905
was followed by an ill-advised venture
into serious dramatic territory.

289
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,156
Simple Jack,

290
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,993
the story of a mentally impaired
farmhand who can talk to animals,

291
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,912
was a box office disaster

292
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:05,666
that many critics called,
"One of the worst movies of all time."

293
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,337
I ain't got a good brain.

294
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,257
I think you've got a fine brain, Jack.

295
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:18,513
You make me happy.

296
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:24,519
But now the question is,
can Speedman make audiences happy

297
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,354
in what's being called
the most expensive

298
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,773
- war movie never made?
- Rick Peck.

299
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,358
Wishing Tugg all the best on that one.

300
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:34,779
Rum-Tum-Tuggernauts, it's the Pecker.
You got time for your agent?

301
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,197
- Rick?
- Hey, buddy,

302
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,865
guess who I'm staring at right now.

303
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,617
- What?
- I'm looking at your ugly mug

304
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,036
on the back cover
of Vanity Fair magazine,

305
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,539
holding a cute, cuddly panda
from Cutesville.

306
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,208
It is insane, bro. You are a rock star.

307
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,961
Hey, did you get the gift basket I sent?

308
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,045
From Rick.

309
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,297
Yeah. Yeah. It's cool, man. Thanks.

310
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,967
All right,
that is a real satellite phone, bro.

311
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,635
Do not re-gift.

312
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,221
Hey. You see
that Access Hollywood piece?

313
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,307
Yeah, I did.
It was like pistol-whipping a blind kid.

314
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:07,812
I mean, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,
Tugg. You are a huge star, all right?

315
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,397
But right now,

316
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,065
you're like that kid on the playground,
you know,

317
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,152
the one who has lice that none
of the other kids want to play with?

318
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,237
- What do you mean?
- I mean we gotta shave your head

319
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,823
and get you back
on the monkey bars, right?

320
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,241
What?

321
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,243
How did the crying scene go?

322
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,078
Horrible. Lazarus started crying.

323
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,331
Then he starts drooling and dribbling,
and it wasn't even in the script...

324
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,583
Stop right there!

325
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,418
You gotta buck up here, Tuggboat.

326
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,171
Who cares how much more talented
he may be than you?

327
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,674
If he cries, you cry harder, man.

328
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,926
Didn't your dog have, like, leukemia
or something

329
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,428
when you were a kid?
I mean, think of that.

330
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:44,265
Boom! End of story.
They hook up the TiVo yet?

331
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,600
Good gosh.

332
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,602
- What?
- The TiVo, they hook it up?

333
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,937
- No. The guy didn't come.
- What?

334
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,607
For fuck's sake, that is unacceptable.

335
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,609
They have digital cable, but,
I mean, it's okay.

336
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,944
No, no, no. Come on, man. It's not okay.

337
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,197
It is not okay, Tugg!

338
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,450
And you don't need to explain to me
why you need TiVo

339
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:06,454
or clean water, clean sheets,
food, shelter.

340
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,707
I mean, I fought for that in your contract.

341
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,876
How's the adoption thing coming,
buddy?

342
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,961
Not too great.

343
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,967
I feel like all the good ones are gone.

344
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,888
Well, at least you get to choose yours.

345
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,806
I'm stuck with mine.

346
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,311
Tell you what, get back to work,
genius soldier.

347
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,231
The Pecker's on a TiVo mission
for the Y-O-U.

348
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,149
Work on those tears, my man.

349
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,317
All right. Yeah.

350
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,985
Say it for me one time.

351
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,323
- You make me happy.
- Make me happy.

352
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,033
- I love you, buddy.
- All right, bye.

353
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,953
Crisis meeting?
What does that mean, exactly?

354
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,704
I mean, are we in a crisis?

355
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,331
He's the head of the studio.

356
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,792
He's reaching out.
We're 10,000 miles away.

357
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,001
He just wants a little face-time.

358
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,712
I know, it's just you said
that he called it a crisis meeting. So...

359
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,215
It's Les Grossman.
He throws these words around.

360
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:03,719
"Crisis," "explosion,"
"not rolling," "fired."

361
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,137
These are just words.

362
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,348
Yeah! Yeah!

363
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,768
Keep a secret? A camera truck in
London just ploughed into Judi Dench.

364
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:11,978
Trust me, he's got bigger problems.

365
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,563
Look, he may be able to see me,
but I can't see him.

366
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,193
- Move! Move! Hello, Les! Hello!
- Get your ass out of my...

367
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,736
- Your feet were on my desk.
- Can he see us?

368
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,154
I don't know why we don't have...

369
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,448
Get him a Diet Coke. Les! It's working!

370
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,034
Yeah, whatever you're doing right there.
Hello, Les!

371
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,536
- Hello, Les!
- Okay.

372
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,705
We got you loud and clear here, Les.

373
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:34,500
I see you. I see you. I see you.

374
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,753
Which one of you fuckfaces
is Damien Cockburn?

375
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,298
That's me, sir.

376
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,926
It's good to finally meet you at last,
get some face-time.

377
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:48,055
And who here is the key grip?
You? You.

378
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:53,519
Hit that director in the face,
really fucking hard.

379
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,736
Sorry, man.

380
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:11,078
This is your fault, you limey fuck!

381
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,039
You shit the money-bed, my friend.

382
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,708
- What?
- God damn it, Damien!

383
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,878
With all due respect, Les Grossman did
not blow up the jungle.

384
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,087
- What?
- Fuck the jungle.

385
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,589
Exactly!

386
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,758
Come on, man.

387
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,178
Hey, Les, I understand if you're angry,

388
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,263
but I am dealing
with a bunch of prima donnas!

389
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:32,892
Clowns! Tugg Speedman, he can't cry!
He can't cry!

390
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,394
You know how you handle an actor?
They whine about anything,

391
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,773
you pull down their pants
and you spank their ass.

392
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,067
- You spank that ass, Les.
- What?

393
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,945
Spanking a child
turns him into a little snot.

394
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,783
Fear makes him a man.

395
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:54,372
I know a place
where a man's worth is measured

396
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:58,250
in the ears hanging from his dog tags.

397
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,087
The real deep shit.

398
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,798
You wanna make this movie right?

399
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:07,468
That's where you take
your pansy-ass actors.

400
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,846
Who is this guy?

401
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,848
Les, that's Four Leaf.

402
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:16,310
Sergeant Four Leaf Tayback.
I wrote the book.

403
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,525
You're a great American.
This nation owes you a huge debt.

404
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,653
Now shut the fuck up
and let me do my job!

405
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,947
- Look, Cockburn.
- Yes.

406
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:32,076
From now on, my fist
is gonna be so far up your shithole

407
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,536
that every time you have a thought,

408
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,664
it's gonna have to tiptoe
past my wedding ring.

409
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,292
Take control of your actors,
or I will shut you down.

410
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,502
Diet Coke!

411
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,480
One week down, two weeks behind,

412
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:05,359
GI Joe can't cry, don't matter 'cause you
ain't got the camera turned on anyway.

413
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,861
Let's party!

414
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,697
Man, you better get your shit straight,

415
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,700
or I'll be on the next NetJet out of here,
baby. You feel me?

416
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,535
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

417
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,204
Here comes another.
There we go. Now what?

418
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,832
- Sandusky. Good.
- Hey, Mr. Cockburn.

419
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,834
We need to have a cast meeting
right now.

420
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,210
- Right now? Awesome.
- Yes.

421
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,503
You actually care, don't you?

422
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,214
Yeah, it's a huge deal for me,
are you kidding?

423
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,300
I've spent the past two years of my life

424
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:33,095
living off residuals from a anti-herpes
medication commercial.

425
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,346
I know, you're the only one
who auditioned,

426
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,015
the only one who did
the two-week boot camp.

427
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,850
Hey, hey, Alpa.

428
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,978
I'm the director. He's...
I need to speak to my actor.

429
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,313
All right, hold up. Chino?

430
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,231
What? Hell, yo. What's up, baby?

431
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,609
This about
the Booty Sweat cross-promotion?

432
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,735
No, it's about the film.

433
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,904
Oh, the film and Booty Sweat's
the same thing. Give him a shot.

434
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,364
Hey, how you doing, Jeff?

435
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,910
- Who are you?
- That's awesome, man.

436
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:02,917
Kevin. Kevin Sandusky. I play Brooklyn,
we've been working together.

437
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,627
Oh, right, right. I like you.

438
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,712
Man, it's a real honor to be here...

439
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,088
I can tell it's gonna be
a good experience.

440
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,340
I'm really having a good time.

441
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,050
Hey, can you help me out, man?
I'm looking for this guy.

442
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:15,387
The grip with the bandana.
He's got a package for me.

443
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,265
There he is, fucker. Dragon!

444
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,143
What the fuck? Oh, buddy!

445
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,645
I'm gonna go shoot a video, right?

446
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,897
I'm gonna have V.C. Soldiers
in the video

447
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,273
doing the noodle-legs, Damien.

448
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:30,778
Hell, yeah, do it. V.C. Soldiers doing
the hip-hop bunny hop, Damien.

449
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,655
It's good, I love it, great. But I need to...

450
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,741
V.C. Soldiers doing the seizure, baby.
Hit it, baby.

451
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,576
Hell yeah, get it. Get it, Cornbread.

452
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:40,913
Alpa!

453
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,414
Yo, check it out. Donny on the phone.

454
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,541
Hello? Yo, yo, Donny!

455
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,751
Can we call him back?
I've got to have a cast meeting.

456
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,549
When we put aside our differences,

457
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,510
we see we're kind of the same.

458
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,973
When we put aside our differences,
we see

459
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,476
we're kind of the same.

460
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,104
Let's be friends.

461
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,982
I know we can do great things together.

462
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,862
That's a quotation from
a children's book I co-wrote,

463
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,782
The Boy Everybody Was Jealous Of.

464
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,617
I think it pertains to the journey...

465
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,035
Simple Jack sucked ass!

466
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,497
All right, who said that? It's not funny.

467
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,374
Whoever it is, it's not funny, okay?

468
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,384
When the herd loses its way,

469
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:39,972
the shepherd must kill
the bull that leads them astray.

470
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:45,019
- Four Leaf?
- Come on over. It's okay.

471
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,188
- Sit down.
- Yes.

472
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:54,695
- So, you don't like the hotel?
- Beds give me nightmares.

473
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:04,955
I'm guessing right about now
you couldn't find a Dixie coonskin

474
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,376
with an Ohio hooker holding your prick
and showing you the way.

475
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,551
What?

476
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,386
You're a riddle

477
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,849
with no cheese to maze through.

478
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,769
Don't you get it?

479
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,522
No, I don't. I'm a cock of the mouse
or something. I don't know.

480
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:34,526
I put my story in your limp Brit hands,

481
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:38,072
and you are not going to fail me.

482
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:41,784
You think I was just blowing
my own bagpipe in that meeting?

483
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,704
You must put those boys in the shit.

484
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,373
What? I don't understand.

485
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:50,751
- You wanna make your movie or not?
- Yes, I do.

486
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:54,380
All right, you get
some of those little video type cameras.

487
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:58,092
We take them out there, and we put
them in the trees in different angles.

488
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:01,553
Then you give me
and that pyromaniac Cody

489
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:06,517
all the smoke bombs, charges,
explosives, detonators you got.

490
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:09,061
Then we take those boys up there,

491
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:12,231
me and Cody,
we could light up that fucking jungle,

492
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:15,275
so those lily-dick actors
would be shitting their pants

493
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,403
and screaming for their mammies.

494
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:20,948
They'd be begging for a body bag
if it means a ride home.

495
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,327
I could do it.

496
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:29,540
I could shoot the whole thing
guerrilla style. Gritty, dirty.

497
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:32,960
Get them away from their helpers
and ass-licking assistants.

498
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,169
Put them in the real shit.

499
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,462
- Real shit.
- With real fear in their eyes!

500
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:38,632
Real fear, real emotion!
Yes, Four Leaf, yes!

501
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,843
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

502
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,761
Take them off the fucking grid!

503
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,948
You are no longer actors in a movie!

504
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,785
You are five men in a helicopter!

505
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,330
With three other men!

506
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,463
How long are we gonna be gone,
anyways?

507
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:21,633
'Cause I left most of my vitamins
back at the hotel.

508
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,344
- Save your breath, maggots!
- That's right, maggots!

509
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:40,861
M&M?

510
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,342
Go, go, go! Get out of the chopper!

511
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,805
Move it, maggots, move!
Move, grunts, move your ass!

512
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,182
Get out, you wriggly worms!

513
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,768
- It's up too high!
- Move, move, move!

514
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,023
See you in hell!

515
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:33,705
This is bullshit!
I gotta at least call my fucking assistant.

516
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,668
Fucking! Jesus! Dude!

517
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,380
You're sitting on a nest
of hostile enemy V.C.

518
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:44,925
Congratulations, Fats.
You just got us all killed.

519
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:49,513
Anybody else care to give away
our position to Charlie?

520
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,390
Cell phones!

521
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,975
What the hell, Damien?

522
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,770
Weren't no cell phones in '69, man.
I'm head-to-toe legitimate.

523
00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:00,274
Gentlemen, I've got good news
and bad news.

524
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,861
The studio wants to shut us down.
That's the bad news.

525
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,321
And the good news.

526
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:09,324
If you wanna save this movie,
you will become a unit.

527
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,203
Your objective is to head north
to the D'ang Kwook River

528
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,788
and liberate the POW camp,

529
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,166
at which point Four Leaf
will get himself captured,

530
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,043
at which point you will rescue him,

531
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,547
at which point
we will chopper you home!

532
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,841
Damn.

533
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,718
Four Leaf,
since you're the staff sergeant,

534
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:30,220
there's the map, this is the scene list.

535
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,472
Think you can handle it?

536
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:36,810
We have rigged this entire
valley of death with hidden cameras.

537
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:41,899
And I will be shooting as well,
from unseen vantage points,

538
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:45,569
so that every glorious moment
is captured on film.

539
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:50,032
And believe me, gentlemen,
it will be glorious.

540
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,659
If it looks real,
chances are it probably is.

541
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,369
You wanted to be actors.

542
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:57,080
You wanted to occupy
the skin of another human being.

543
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,167
Well, get ready to occupy the skin
of a terrified U.S. Infantry grunt,

544
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:04,046
surrounded by death,
crawling up Satan's bottom.

545
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:09,760
There'll be ambushes, enemy fire,
your own little personal slice of 'Nam.

546
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:14,473
This radio goes to the chopper
and the chopper only.

547
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:19,019
The chopper is God,
and I am Jesus Christ, his son.

548
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,813
You are my chosen disciples.

549
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,942
And no one gets to go home
till we get the shots.

550
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:28,111
Put on your war faces, gentlemen.

551
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:32,908
Now, let's go and make
the greatest war movie ever!

552
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,369
- Yeah!
- All right!

553
00:32:54,055 --> 00:33:01,645
Yeah!

554
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,118
Not bad, Cockburn!

555
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,162
Not bad.

556
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,457
Wherever you are!

557
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,504
Wherever he is?
Looks like he's all over the place.

558
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,216
Here we go.

559
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,343
Must be an old French mine.

560
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,930
It's a remnant from colonial Indo-China.
This jungle must be full of them.

561
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:42,477
Don't you get it?
He's messing with our heads.

562
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,604
That's what all that
playing God stuff was about.

563
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,274
He's trying to get us to act good,
save the movie.

564
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,444
He ain't playing God.
He's being judged by him.

565
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,117
That's our objective.
Complete the mission.

566
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,209
No offense, Kirk,
I know you're the big fancy actor here,

567
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:10,213
but I've done a lot more effects-driven
event films than you. Okay?

568
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,715
And I think I can spot

569
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,385
a prop head when I see one.

570
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,970
Oh, Jesus.

571
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:21,683
It's corn syrup, guys.
Corn syrup and latex.

572
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:28,023
Warm, blood-flavored corn syrup.

573
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,232
Oh, God.

574
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:33,028
Smoke and mirrors, guys.
Welcome to the movie factory.

575
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,321
Oldest trick in the book.

576
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,616
He getting down now.

577
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,076
Oh, my God!

578
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,955
Whoa, look at me!

579
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,540
You're going to get the shots,

580
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:48,627
and I'm going to make sure
because I'm the director.

581
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,879
I'm from London. I direct plays.

582
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:54,007
Hey, Damien! We got our war faces on!

583
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,727
Look, I'm Dave Beckham.

584
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,781
So, we gotta
light these boys up today, huh?

585
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,075
Blow some sense into these young men.

586
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,954
Hey, I don't want to come off
as weird or anything,

587
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:27,958
but I might be your biggest fan. Yeah.

588
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,879
Tropic Thunder.
Kind of like my Catcher in the Rye.

589
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,299
Yeah, I've never been in the military,
per se,

590
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,885
but I have lost an appendage
in the line of duty.

591
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,889
Driving Miss Daisy, first studio gig.

592
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,724
Yeah.

593
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:48,019
It's a pretty cool sidearm you got there.
What is it?

594
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,813
I don't know what it's called.

595
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:55,652
I just know the sound it makes
when it takes a man's life.

596
00:35:58,781 --> 00:35:59,906
Okay.

597
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,658
Damien, we're go for explosion.

598
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:04,578
Ready to kick the tires
and light the fires on your say-so.

599
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,413
Damien, we're go for explosion.

600
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,582
Do you copy?

601
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,543
I got an itchy trigger finger here,
and I'm ready to blow some shit up.

602
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:15,297
All right, you happy now?
Can we do the scene?

603
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:18,008
Or do you need a formal invitation?
Come on, let's go!

604
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:20,927
Here. Okay.

605
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,263
"Scene 12, exterior,
jungle clearing, day, ambush.

606
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,687
"Four Leaf notices
movement in the brush.

607
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:33,857
"A dozen guerrilla fighters
can be seen moving in the tree line.

608
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,526
"Somewhere a mine explodes."
And you.

609
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,863
"I got a bad feeling on this one."

610
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,489
- Yeah.
- No, that's your line.

611
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,451
- I got... Now?
- Yeah, but scared. Like, scared.

612
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,287
- "I got a bad feeling on this one."
- Dude, wait, like how?

613
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,206
"I got a bad feeling on this one."

614
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,458
- Okay.
- Action. Go, come on.

615
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,303
I got a bad feeling
on this one there, Fats.

616
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,058
Our asses don't get fragged
in this bullshit valley,

617
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,976
first thing I'm doing
is paying my two bucks

618
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,728
so I can watch Brooklyn bust his cherry

619
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,522
on a sweet little mama-san's
dinky dau poontang.

620
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,525
Shit, Brooklyn be bagged and tagged
before he get any cooch.

621
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,862
He die, he probably die
a coochless motherfucker.

622
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,364
Zip it, Motown.

623
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,032
Don't you worry, Brooklyn.

624
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,201
You got a lot of days of fucking
ahead of you.

625
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,913
Man, I'm thirsty.

626
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:36,002
Might as well have some of this
Booty Sweat I got back in Danang.

627
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:40,340
Yo, asshole! This motherfucker's dead!

628
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,259
Ain't no Criss Angel Mindfreak,

629
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,679
David Blaine trapdoor
horseshit jumping off here!

630
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:49,557
Hey! You wanna get on the train here,
or do you wanna ruin another take?

631
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:53,019
There ain't no goddamn takes,
ain't no goddamn motion picture!

632
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,730
- You sure?
- Yeah.

633
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,607
- Yeah?
- For certain, man.

634
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,609
Then why are you still in character?

635
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,196
I know, but I don't have to tell you.

636
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,365
You don't know.

637
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,410
Man, I don't drop character
till I done a DVD commentary.

638
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,331
You happy now?
We're out of position for the effects!

639
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,208
Get down, fool!

640
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,796
Didn't anyone read the script?
This is the ambush!

641
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,884
- This feels pretty real!
- Exactly! Let's use it.

642
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:39,274
Yeah!

643
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,153
Eat lead!

644
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,490
They're busting caps
like a motherfucker down there.

645
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,829
This is FUBAR. I say we juice them.

646
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,456
- What do you think?
- Juice them.

647
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,336
Fuck you, Charlie!

648
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,922
Big-ass titties!

649
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,513
Look at that, huh?

650
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,978
And cut!

651
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,066
That's the trailer right there.

652
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,484
Yeah!

653
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,861
- What do we do now?
- Yeah.

654
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,488
North. Man said to head north.

655
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,908
- Did you see me shooting?
- That's how we do. Good work, baby.

656
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,076
I believed it.

657
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,369
D'ang Kwook River.

658
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,371
I'm betting
he's got more of these battles

659
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:37,207
and Viet Congs
rigged for us along the way.

660
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:41,127
Sergeant Osiris, get your men.
Load and lock.

661
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,546
Real, baby, I'm real.

662
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,384
Let's go! We got a lot of klicks to cover!

663
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,554
Hump it up, gentlemen!
Single formation.

664
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,515
Don't dawdle now!

665
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:21,918
D-Rod, D-Rod, this is Puddingface.
How are we coming on that hotplate?

666
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,841
Something's up.
I think we better drag ass back there.

667
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,677
Make sure Damien ain't forgot
how to use his talkbox again.

668
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:41,354
Yeah, baby, come on. Just a little taste.

669
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,108
- What are you doing, Jeff?
- Fucking... Nothing, man!

670
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:48,528
- I'm eating jellybeans.
- Wow, I love jellybeans. Can I please...

671
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,364
No, you can't have
any fucking jellybeans.

672
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,574
They're mine.

673
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,825
You think
you're the only one who gets sick

674
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,618
when he doesn't have his jellybeans?

675
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,120
Boundaries, man. Fuck.

676
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,767
Hey. I didn't mean to
show you up back there.

677
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:23,980
It's just, I feel like we really need
to set the example for the other guys.

678
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,982
It's gonna be tough,

679
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:29,152
but I think Damien's gonna get
some great shit out of us.

680
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,405
Just wish I had
a director like this on Jack.

681
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,991
On Jack. What? Jack?
What you talking about?

682
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,161
- Simple Jack.
- Oh, yeah.

683
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,916
Simple Jack, yeah.
You went all out on that one, huh?

684
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,293
You did.
Really swung for the fences, huh?

685
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,795
Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.

686
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,798
Yeah, it was an intense experience,
you know.

687
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,593
I just did the work.

688
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:57,514
Watched a lot of retarded people.
Spent time with them. Observed them.

689
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,975
Watched all the retarded stuff they did.

690
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,852
Then again,
I always found mere observation

691
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,230
in and of itself is a tad rudimentary.

692
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:08,399
Sometimes, we gotta dig deeper
to mine the true emotional pay dirt.

693
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:12,862
Thus, we can diagram the source
of the pain and then live it, you know.

694
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,031
Yeah, yeah, live it. Yeah, exactly.

695
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:17,867
You know, there were times
when I was doing Jack

696
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,411
that I actually felt retarded,

697
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,871
- like really retarded.
- Oh, yeah.

698
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,207
I mean, I brushed my teeth retarded,

699
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,084
- I rode the bus retarded.
- Damn.

700
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:29,420
In a weird way,
I had to sort of just free myself up

701
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,507
to believe that it was okay
to be stupid or dumb.

702
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,175
- To be a moron.
- Yeah.

703
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:37,011
- To be moronical.
- Exactly, to be a moron.

704
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,471
- An imbecile.
- Yeah.

705
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,432
Like the dumbest motherfucker
that ever lived.

706
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,725
When I was playing the character.

707
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,395
- When you was the character.
- Yeah, as Jack, definitely.

708
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,730
Jack, stupid ass Jack.

709
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,065
Trying to come back from that.

710
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:53,319
In a weird way it was almost like
I had to sort of fool my mind

711
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,406
into believing that it wasn't retarded,

712
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,241
and by the end of the whole thing,
I was like,

713
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:02,870
"Wait a minute, I flushed so much out,
how am I gonna jumpstart it up again?"

714
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,039
- It's just like... Right?
- Yeah.

715
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,917
You was farting in bathtubs
and laughing your ass off.

716
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,877
Yeah.

717
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,255
But Simple Jack thought he was smart,

718
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,673
or rather, didn't think he was retarded,

719
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,634
so you can't afford to play retarded,
being a smart actor.

720
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,262
Playing a guy who ain't smart
but thinks he is,

721
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,972
- that's tricky.
- Tricky.

722
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:24,601
It's like working with mercury.
It's high science, man. It's an art form.

723
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,769
- Yeah.
- You an artist.

724
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,646
- That's what we do, right? Yeah.
- Yeah.

725
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,023
Hats off for going there,

726
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,859
especially knowing how
the Academy is about that shit.

727
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:40,074
- About what?
- You're serious? You don't know?

728
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,370
Everybody knows
you never go full retard.

729
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,957
- What do you mean?
- Check it out.

730
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:52,211
Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man, looked
retarded, act retarded, not retarded.

731
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:56,424
Count toothpicks, cheat at cards.
Autistic, sure. Not retarded.

732
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,135
Then you got Tom Hanks,
Forrest Gump.

733
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:01,554
Slow, yes, retarded, maybe,
braces on his legs.

734
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,557
But he charmed the pants off Nixon,
and he won a Ping-Pong competition.

735
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,683
That ain't retarded.

736
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:09,771
And he was a goddamn war hero.
You know any retarded war heroes?

737
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,733
You went full retard, man.

738
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,611
Never go full retard.

739
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:21,157
You don't buy that?
Ask Sean Penn, 2001, I Am Sam.

740
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:24,577
Remember? Went full retard?
Went home empty-handed.

741
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:37,632
Oh, my God! Holy shit!

742
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,968
Good job, turd. You killed the director.

743
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,345
No, that's impossible, man.

744
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:45,306
I rigged the whole tree line,
and this is here.

745
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,974
- He must have missed his mark.
- Missed his mark?

746
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,309
Yeah, this isn't me.

747
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:51,229
Come on, let's bag and tag the bastard
and get back to the hotel.

748
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:54,023
- You're in a world of hurt, dumbo!
- We're in a world of hurt!

749
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,317
- You're in trouble.
- This isnt just on me!

750
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,653
- We're in a... We're together on this.
- Bullshit.

751
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,238
You're just gonna run away.
You're gonna leave.

752
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:01,989
What happened to,
"No man left behind," okay?

753
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,367
Just wait, just wait! Listen!
Listen, okay?

754
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:07,203
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Let me just be real with you, all right?

755
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:10,623
I almost blinded Jamie Lee Curtis
on Freaky Friday, okay?

756
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,041
This shit will fucking ruin me!

757
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,043
- Just get off me! You're pathetic.
- No, I'm not.

758
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,629
- Get off me!
- You are not going back!

759
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,968
- What the fuck?
- Now wait a minute.

760
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:35,022
So, what?
We're just supposed to keep walking?

761
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,984
Try to stay in character.
Remember, we're on camera.

762
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,110
This thing's too heavy.

763
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,611
I want the rubber one
that the prop guy gave me.

764
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,989
Where's the fucking prop guy?

765
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,538
How's it going with that map, chief?

766
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:53,249
- Can I have a look at it?
- I got it.

767
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,917
Yeah, Damien gave it to me,
remember?

768
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,544
Yeah, but he gave it to you for us.

769
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,254
- Yeah.
- Okay.

770
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,882
- I got it.
- You got it upside down.

771
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,049
Thank you.

772
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,718
Letters go one way
and the numbers another.

773
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,386
Dude, I'm trying to...
I got your back, man.

774
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,221
- Well, I'm cool. All right, I'm cool.
- You are?

775
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,223
Is your character dyslexic?

776
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,058
- No, my character's not dyslexic.
- So you a cartographer.

777
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,977
I'm tired, I want to go home.

778
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:15,605
Why, so you can get back and make
Fatties: Fart 20, or some shit?

779
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,649
It's Fatties: Fart Two, there's no... Hey,
you wish you had a Fatties franchise.

780
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:19,984
- What?
- It's Fatties: Fart Two.

781
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,319
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't want no Fatties franchise,

782
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,821
- I got a diamond toilet.
- Your stupid-ass commercials.

783
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,406
You're all fucked up, man,
you look tired.

784
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,616
You look like you bumped your head
or something,

785
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,576
so I came over to see
if you're fucking all right, that's all.

786
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,703
- Yeah, why don't you get on point?
- I'm on point right here.

787
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:31,829
...my farts
are fucking more beautiful than...

788
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:34,540
You still got that shit upside down.

789
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,501
The numbers help, man, the numbers...

790
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,836
The letters go across the top
and then the numbers.

791
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,505
- Want the map?
- Yeah, I want the fucking map.

792
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,048
Well, you can't have it,
'cause Damien gave it me.

793
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:45,301
You wish you had my farts,
my farts are fucking music.

794
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,762
All right. That's enough.

795
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:53,017
Everybody's obviously a little bushed
from all this humping.

796
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,103
So take a chow break. Chow break!

797
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,440
But stay alert.

798
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:03,569
Remember, Charlie don't care
if you're on break or not.

799
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:11,536
All right, that's lunch. Coming back
to the same scene afterwards,

800
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,995
"Lost in the goddamn jungle."

801
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,121
Captain Simple Jack.

802
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:15,873
Fuck you.

803
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,592
I fucking hate movies.

804
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,764
This is bullshit.
I don't wanna be in this shitty movie.

805
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,318
No! That's my jellybeans! No!

806
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:49,115
Kid, grab the bat! Please! Shit!

807
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:52,493
- Yo, man, I got a Bust-A-Nut.
- You go to hell! There he is.

808
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:58,833
God damn it! Okay. Where'd he go?

809
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,128
You little piece of shit!
I'm gonna fucking rip your wings off!

810
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:07,300
Sanducci. Hold up, man,
keep it on the down-low.

811
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,887
I don't really gotta piss.
I'm trying to talk at you, man.

812
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,638
Bait, I need bait.

813
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:17,476
You went to boot camp, right?
You can read a map?

814
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:18,811
Yeah, I think so.

815
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:21,606
I know Speedman
got everyone convinced we out here

816
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,526
making Planet of the Apes on YouTube
or some shit, but I don't buy it.

817
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:28,112
You wanna step on a real landmine?
You wanna die?

818
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,573
You wanna get shot
by a real motherfucker?

819
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,868
- Keep looking ahead, man.
- No, of course not.

820
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:36,412
Trying to get home, man.

821
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:38,205
Got a big job coming up next year.

822
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,707
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

823
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,376
It's about Abe Lincoln and John Wilkes
Booth when they were both young.

824
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,544
- Oh, wow!
- Yeah.

825
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,172
- That's a classy picture.
- Dude, you kind of look like Abe.

826
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,715
Slap a beard on you.

827
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,884
- What's your fucking name?
- Really? It's Kevin.

828
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,011
- Kevin Sandusky.
- Yeah.

829
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:56,223
If I can put that map in your hands,
can I count on you?

830
00:48:56,558 --> 00:49:00,186
- Well, yeah, I guess you can.
- Dynamite. I'm out.

831
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:06,233
That smelled just like bologna
for some reason.

832
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,903
Is anyone gonna fucking help me
get this fucking thing?

833
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:12,198
Why are they even out in the daytime?

834
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:18,829
I'm gonna level with you, bro.
I don't need to pee. I need to talk to you.

835
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:28,839
Lazarus is gonna torpedo the movie.

836
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,760
He's way out on a limb
with this character,

837
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,720
and I think he's getting cold feet.

838
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,766
And the men respect you,
'cause you went to boot camp

839
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,559
and rehearsal.

840
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:44,105
- Can I count on you, Kyle.
- It's Kevin.

841
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,272
Good.

842
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:49,694
If you want
I could give the map a look-see.

843
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,946
- I'll handle the map.
- Okay.

844
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:55,282
You stick with the program,
we get this movie in the can,

845
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:59,120
I'm thinking there could be
a Teen Choice Award in it for you.

846
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:03,416
You have that potential.
They'll slime you, the whole deal.

847
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:07,128
- Yeah, that's wicked.
- Good.

848
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,136
There it is! Yeah, now you're dead!

849
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:17,596
You O.D.'d!

850
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,474
Hold up now, Jeff.

851
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:24,270
Fucking hell!

852
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:28,983
What the hell, Jeff? That's a bat, man!

853
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,569
I don't have any more jellybeans.

854
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,952
You land there!

855
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:57,303
Wow. Look at these ruins.

856
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:03,851
- Where the hell are we?
- D'ang Kwook River.

857
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,353
That so? How do you know that?
How you sure?

858
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,647
Only one way to find out, dude. Let's go.

859
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:13,861
Yeah. I'm not feeling so good right now.
Seriously, my skin hurts!

860
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,363
Enough from the peanut gallery!
Into the water, ladies!

861
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,616
No, man. Let me take a look at that map
right quick.

862
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,326
Why is everybody
all obsessed with the map?

863
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,453
'Cause we're tired
of being your trail donkeys!

864
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:24,955
Acting like you some one-man GPS!

865
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,918
God damn it! We lost!
We fucking super lost, man!

866
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:31,170
Tell him, McClusky.
Tell him what time it is.

867
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,838
I don't believe you people.

868
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,300
What do you mean "you people"?

869
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,555
What do you mean, "you people"?

870
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:43,641
I think what Tugg means is...

871
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:45,101
No, look at his eyes, man.

872
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,937
...you people, you actors. You people...
- Look at them beady, white devil eyes.

873
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,605
I gotta get back to the hotel, for real!

874
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,690
- Hell, no!
- Silence!

875
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:55,361
Chill! All right? Just chill it.

876
00:51:56,863 --> 00:52:00,074
Now, let's go get those Viet Congs.

877
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:02,493
- "Viet Cong"!
- What?

878
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:05,996
It's "Viet Cong." There's no "S."
It's already plural.

879
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,706
You wouldn't say "Chineses."

880
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:11,502
All right, that's enough
of this insubordination!

881
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:14,421
If the machine breaks down,
we break down.

882
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,049
Hey, man, you know how in Rambo I,
he was big but a little puffy

883
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,759
and then Rambo II,
he got all shredded up?

884
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,720
- Yeah.
- That's kind of how you look right now.

885
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,389
- Yeah?
- Not Rambo I but II.

886
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:25,224
- Really?
- Yeah, when he was cut up.

887
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,685
I'm not that... I mean,
that's what I'm going for, but you know...

888
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:30,479
Come on, dude. You more shredded
than a julienne salad, man.

889
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,106
- Thanks.
- What's the secret, dude?

890
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,566
- It's a diet. I'm just dieting.
- Really?

891
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:36,652
'Cause I'm trying to come up a little,
but it's just... lt's tough.

892
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,279
- You look good.
- Any tips?

893
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,072
- What?
- Any tips, you got?

894
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:41,282
There's, like, the pineapple...

895
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,701
- Give me that goddamn map! Fuck you!
- Hey!

896
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:45,411
- Hey!
- All right, now!

897
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,955
What it is, Sikorski?
Tell us where we really at.

898
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:50,040
That's fucking bullshit!
It's a chump move.

899
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,084
We just getting a second opinion, doc.

900
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,171
We're going the wrong way!

901
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,380
- Damn!
- Son of a bitch.

902
00:52:56,464 --> 00:53:00,968
God! I think we were
supposed to be doing this,

903
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:03,971
and instead we did this.

904
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:07,683
Shit, shit, shit, shitty shit, shit!

905
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:10,311
Think you can get us back
to that drop zone, boy?

906
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,646
This is not cool!

907
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,483
Maybe.

908
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,445
This is insane!

909
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:23,073
Are you really going
to abandon this movie?

910
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:26,035
We're supposed to be a unit!

911
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,661
Suck my unit!

912
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:30,331
All right, fine.

913
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:35,336
- I'll finish it by myself.
- You go be all you can be, man.

914
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,463
Tugg, you have no idea
where you're going!

915
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,340
Yes, I do!

916
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:44,011
I'm going to, "Exterior, rain forest, dusk.

917
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:48,557
"Smash cut to Four Leaf, who treks
alone through a frightening jungle."

918
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,643
Suck on that unit, Kirk!

919
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:07,201
Come on, men. Let's get home.

920
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:50,035
Hello, Mr. Mantis. You're beautiful.

921
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:54,248
Now, if you recall that whole hullabaloo

922
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,083
where Hollywood
was split into schisms,

923
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:59,586
some studios backing Blu-ray Disc,
others backing HD DVD.

924
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:00,754
People thought it would come down to

925
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,132
pixel rate or refresh rate,
and they're pretty much the same.

926
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:07,052
What it came down to was
a combination of gamers and porn.

927
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,887
Now, whichever format porno backs

928
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:12,808
is usually the one
that becomes the most successful.

929
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,936
But, you know, Sony,
every PlayStation 3 has a Blu-ray in it.

930
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,771
You talking to me this whole time?

931
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,773
I was talking to whoever
was listening to me.

932
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:21,400
Jesus Christ, man!

933
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,879
Booty Sweat.

934
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,303
Oh, God!

935
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:56,101
It's cold! It's freezing. I'm fucking cold.

936
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:58,395
You want my flak jacket?

937
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,358
What, are you insane? It's boiling!
It's like a sweat lodge out here!

938
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,319
Keep the volume down on that bitching,
Flatch Adams.

939
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,321
I gotta take a fucking 12-pound shit!

940
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,365
- How we doing? We making good time?
- We're making good time,

941
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:12,618
but there's no way we make it
over that ridge before sundown.

942
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,204
All right, fellas,
we're gonna make camp, rest up!

943
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:17,623
- Oh, God.
- Y'all might be in for a treat.

944
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,124
You know,
back before the war broked out,

945
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,960
I was a saucier in San Antone.

946
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,671
I bet I could collar up
some of them greens.

947
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:29,093
Yeah, noodle some crawfish
out the paddy, yo.

948
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:33,263
And maybe some crab apples
for dessert, now, you hear? Hell, yeah!

949
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:35,849
Hell, yeah!

950
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:40,145
That's how we all talk.
We all talk like this, suh! Yes, suh.

951
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:45,484
Yeah, get some crawfish and some ribs.

952
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:50,489
You're Australian! Be Australian!
Excuse me, Kangaroo Jack.

953
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:57,121
I get excited about my foods, man.

954
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:25,167
Die!

955
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:41,183
No!

956
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:52,027
Dude, dude, what the hell
is going on here? Where are we?

957
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,530
I have no idea.

958
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:57,199
I've never been outside the States.

959
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:59,493
Wait, what?
Are you fucking kidding me?

960
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,578
Did you make this
whole goddamn thing up?

961
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,038
Dude, were you
even in the fucking service?

962
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,832
Yes. Of course. Coast Guard.

963
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:07,834
- Coast Guard.
- Sanitation Department.

964
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,629
Oh, my God!
You're a fucking garbage man!

965
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:14,466
Damn it. F.L. Tayback lies to me
and the whole goddamn U.S. Of A.

966
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,219
I wrote the book as a tribute!
I'm a patriot!

967
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:19,388
Yeah, you're the Milli Vanilli
of patriots, okay?

968
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,181
You lied
about fighting the Vietnam War.

969
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:24,560
It's like punching the American flag
in the face, God damn it.

970
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,103
God, and to think I believed in you!

971
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:28,564
- I don't wanna be next to you.
- Writers lie all the time.

972
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,816
Can I be tied to another post? Okay.

973
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,256
- Rick?
- Tugg.

974
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,425
I killed one, Rick.

975
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,970
The thing I love most in the world.

976
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:01,888
Vivica, get off the line now!

977
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,602
A hooker. All right, you killed a hooker.

978
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,770
Calm down.
Here's what you're gonna do.

979
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,063
Get your hands on some bleach,

980
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,524
some hydrogen peroxide
and a shitload of lime.

981
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,109
No, a panda.

982
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,986
I killed a panda.

983
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,904
Amanda? Come on, dude.

984
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,032
I mean,
that's probably not even her real name.

985
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,783
No, a panda!

986
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,243
A panda?

987
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:25,954
A sweet, cuddly,

988
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,998
vicious little panda.

989
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:31,084
Jesus Christ, Tugg!
Man, don't scare me like that!

990
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:32,336
It's beautiful here.

991
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,920
You on the set?

992
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,297
I am the set.

993
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:38,383
All right, man.
Hey, how's the TiVo working out?

994
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:39,718
Screw TiVo.

995
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,262
I'm way beyond TiVo.

996
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:44,473
Last I checked,
they hadn't hooked it up, though.

997
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:47,893
Hadn't hooked it up? No TiVo?

998
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,811
It doesn't matter anymore.

999
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,107
I've moved on.

1000
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,610
Where have you moved on to?

1001
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:58,195
Another agency?

1002
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:01,281
Who's with you?

1003
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,533
It's Nick Stevens, isn't it?
That little fucker.

1004
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:07,746
You are still my client, Tugg Speedman!
I am getting the TiVo!

1005
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,040
Jacket's on, I'm out the door!

1006
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:11,208
Tugg?

1007
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:15,796
Please don't fire me.

1008
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:17,881
I did it, I did it!

1009
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:20,300
Vivica, what do I have scheduled
this afternoon?

1010
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:23,303
- Two and a Half Men taping.
- Shit.

1011
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:25,305
Cancel it.

1012
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,099
And get me Tugg's Tropic Thunder
contract.

1013
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:30,310
I'm going to Grossman's office,
I'm playing the card.

1014
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:31,436
Okay.

1015
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:37,859
Oh, mama. Thirsty.

1016
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,112
He doesn't look too good.

1017
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:45,200
Must drink,
so I can throw something up!

1018
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,452
No, no. Don't drink that water!
That water's like a petri dish!

1019
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:48,620
No, don't!

1020
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:51,289
Alpa, do you have any Booty Sweat?

1021
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,792
Yeah, get him chugging on
some of Alpa's ass water.

1022
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,794
That'll bring him around. It's a cure-all.

1023
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,796
Man, what you coming out
in movies for anyway?

1024
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:59,548
Did you need another revenue stream?

1025
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:02,467
For your information,
my revenue stream

1026
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:04,886
currently generates $2 million a year

1027
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,972
in charitable contributions
for my community.

1028
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,391
- Hot damn.
- And why am I in this movie?

1029
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:11,810
Maybe I just knew I had to represent,

1030
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,729
because they had one good part
in it for a black man

1031
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,897
and they gave it to Crocodile Dundee.

1032
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:21,069
Pump your brakes, kid.
That man is a national treasure.

1033
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,321
I just wanted to throw another shrimp
on your barbie.

1034
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:24,489
That shit ain't funny.

1035
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:27,325
Hey, fellas! It's hot!
We're tired! It stinks!

1036
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:28,994
I'm just fucking with you,
Kangaroo Jack!

1037
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,829
I'm sorry a dingo ate your baby.

1038
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:33,415
You know that's a true story?
Lady lost her kid.

1039
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:36,168
- You about to cross some fucking lines.
- Guys, relax and stuff.

1040
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:37,335
You know what? Fuck that, man!

1041
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:40,130
I'm sick of this koala-hugging nigger
telling me...

1042
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,428
For 400 years,

1043
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,348
that word has kept us down.

1044
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,018
What the fuck?

1045
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:56,938
It took a whole lot of trying
just to get up that hill.

1046
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,941
Now we up in the big leagues,

1047
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,777
getting our turn at bat.

1048
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,529
Long as we live, it's you and me, baby.

1049
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:08,533
That's the theme song for
The Jeffersons. You really need help.

1050
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:11,787
Yeah. Just 'cause it's the theme song,
don't make it not true.

1051
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,872
You know what?
I'm gonna tell you what's true.

1052
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:17,375
I'm gonna tag you back.
You better believe that, baby.

1053
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:20,045
Guys! Hey, guys!

1054
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:23,173
Jeff, stay away from that animal.

1055
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,386
I'm gonna bite his hide. I need...

1056
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:32,682
I need to wear his stomach skin
like a unitard.

1057
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:36,895
Ain't nobody doing nothing
to no one or body!

1058
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:41,900
Now, if Mr. Portnoy is feeling
a little flu-ish, don't wanna walk,

1059
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:44,069
put him up on that cloven-hoof animal!

1060
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:46,738
We got ground to cover!

1061
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:19,020
All right, POW camp, scene 67.

1062
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:21,606
Bring it on, Cockburn!

1063
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,117
Maybe he's not, you know,
Ridley Scott or something,

1064
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,035
but I think Renny Harlin's
a tremendous filmmaker

1065
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,955
like, Adventures of Ford Fairlane,
you know,

1066
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:40,709
as far as an Andrew Dice Clay
vehicle goes, it's pretty decent.

1067
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:43,211
And Cliffhanger.
Cliffhanger's incredible.

1068
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,798
As far as the whole like,
man against nature type of movies go,

1069
01:04:46,924 --> 01:04:49,050
it's absolutely amazing.

1070
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:51,094
Shut the fuck up!

1071
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:57,392
Who send you here?

1072
01:04:57,476 --> 01:05:02,147
Tayback, John, Sergeant,
United States Army.

1073
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:08,278
Serial number 694529987.

1074
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:15,076
Perhaps some hot tea
will make conversing

1075
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:16,953
a little easier.

1076
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:22,834
My leader's not quite as cordial.

1077
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:29,174
Look, what? I just thought you might
like some hot tea

1078
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:32,761
- in order to calm your nerves.
- Tayback, John, Sergeant,

1079
01:05:32,845 --> 01:05:37,849
United States Army, 694529987.

1080
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:44,272
And here's a little message
from my Uncle Sam.

1081
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:52,280
Dude, you all right?

1082
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:53,782
Man you totally leaned into that.

1083
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:56,952
I was pulling it back
and you just came in too...

1084
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:59,287
Hey, it was an accident, man.

1085
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,708
Come on, good.
You want to keep going?

1086
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:05,460
- Let's go.
- Get up.

1087
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:07,128
I rather rot in your V.C. Jail!

1088
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:11,132
I'll never bend to your will!
You scum! You scum!

1089
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,218
Now say this
and go to the beginning again,

1090
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:15,136
let's do the tea part, okay?

1091
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,056
Dude, I hope you're not pissed.

1092
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,225
I see moss on both sides of that tree.

1093
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:23,478
Well, you know, maybe if I wasn't
the only one at boot camp...

1094
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,480
My belly really hurts, you guys!

1095
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:27,732
I'm not joking around, I'm nauseous.

1096
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:30,068
Let me off, I gotta puke!
I don't wanna die like Hendrix!

1097
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:31,903
All right. All right.

1098
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:38,410
Are you okay, Jeff?

1099
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:39,911
I'm awesome.

1100
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:43,748
Holy shit!

1101
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:50,505
Okay. Everyone, down, down, down.

1102
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,678
Man. Now I'm tripping.

1103
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:59,431
That looks like the POW camp
from out the script, yo.

1104
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,017
Speedman was right?

1105
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:03,435
I don't think so.

1106
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,770
Look at the cooking vats,
the armed guards.

1107
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:09,524
Looks like a heroin processing plant.

1108
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:11,776
We were in that chopper for hours.

1109
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:14,112
I don't even think
we're in Vietnam anymore.

1110
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:16,614
- Fuck.
- Shit. We ain't even in 'Nam?

1111
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:19,534
No, most likely Myanmar or Laos.

1112
01:07:19,618 --> 01:07:21,161
What the fuck is Laos?

1113
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:22,454
It's the Golden Triangle.

1114
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,497
Oh, fuck. We're dead.

1115
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:26,583
No one gets out of here. I saw it on TV.

1116
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:30,712
Fucking boats, airplanes,
UFOs and shit, they all just vanish!

1117
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:33,339
Yo, that's the Bermuda Triangle,
dumbass.

1118
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,800
This is the Golden Triangle.

1119
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:37,469
It's the world's hard drug superhighway.

1120
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:38,887
How do you know that?

1121
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:41,765
It was a really long trip.
I read the in-flight magazine.

1122
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:44,809
Cut!

1123
01:07:44,935 --> 01:07:46,394
Oh, Jesus!

1124
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:48,980
What do you see, man? I'm blocked.

1125
01:07:49,106 --> 01:07:50,482
Damien, cut!

1126
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:53,818
Hey, Damien, cut!

1127
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:56,321
They got Speedman.

1128
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:58,323
And it doesn't look good.

1129
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:32,357
I am Tran.

1130
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:35,485
You are a trespasser in my poppy fields.

1131
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:39,531
You are D.E.A. Scum!

1132
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:44,869
Were there some re-writes
that I missed?

1133
01:08:51,168 --> 01:08:52,710
Do you want to die?

1134
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:54,879
- Do you?
- No!

1135
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:59,175
Please, don't hurt me!

1136
01:09:07,017 --> 01:09:08,226
Say that again.

1137
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:11,020
Please, don't hurt me.

1138
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:14,232
No! Like you did before! Say it!

1139
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:16,192
Say it!

1140
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:20,280
Please, don't hurt me!

1141
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:38,548
- What?
- You are Simple Jack.

1142
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,344
You saw Simple Jack?

1143
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,763
We love the tale of this man,
Simple Jack.

1144
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,309
We do not have many luxury here.

1145
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:51,853
And Simple Jack is the only movie
we possess.

1146
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:55,773
You got the VHS.

1147
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,942
We've watched it many, many times.

1148
01:09:58,068 --> 01:10:00,570
You should've got Oscar.

1149
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:05,325
Well, you know. It's...

1150
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:07,869
Just to be nominated...

1151
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:09,204
You were nominated?

1152
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:10,830
No, no, no. I wasn't nominated.

1153
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:14,125
I'm just saying that to have been
nominated would have been nice.

1154
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:16,586
It's just... lt's very political.
You have to take out ads...

1155
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:19,172
- Shut up now!
- Okay. Okay.

1156
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:21,799
So, are you going to

1157
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:25,011
let me go, or...

1158
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:27,263
No. We'll hold you for ransom.

1159
01:10:27,348 --> 01:10:29,140
Much more money now!

1160
01:10:40,694 --> 01:10:41,736
He's in a meeting.

1161
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:44,656
Yeah, I know.
In about two seconds with the Pecker.

1162
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:47,492
I'm gonna rip your fucking tits off.

1163
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:50,286
You wanna talk about trouble?
That's trouble.

1164
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:51,996
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1165
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:55,750
What do you need, Peck?

1166
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:58,503
No, more like what do you need, Les?

1167
01:10:58,629 --> 01:10:59,837
Glasses?

1168
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:01,923
What?

1169
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:04,509
So you can read
the Tropic Thunder contract

1170
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:07,011
that guarantees my client,
Tugg Speedman,

1171
01:11:07,137 --> 01:11:10,848
some form of digital video recorder
on location.

1172
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:13,810
- Huh?
- I can't believe you let him in.

1173
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:18,231
Look, fuckstick, I'm incredibly busy,
so why don't you get the hell out of here

1174
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:21,401
before I snap your dick off
and jam it into your ass?

1175
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:23,528
No, not you, Helen.

1176
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:27,365
But I will rip your tits off
if you don't get me those theaters.

1177
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:28,992
Perfect.

1178
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:31,536
Hey, Tuggernuts,
I've got you on speakerphone.

1179
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:33,496
I'm standing here with Les Grossman,

1180
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:36,749
and he is dying to tell you
why he's apparently wiped his ass

1181
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:39,210
with the TiVo clause from your contract.

1182
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:42,380
We are Flaming Dragon.

1183
01:11:42,506 --> 01:11:44,841
Speedman is with us now.

1184
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:48,511
For 50 million, you will get him back.

1185
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:50,763
- Are you gonna get those...
- Who is this?

1186
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:53,558
- And how did you get this phone?
- We are Flaming Dragon!

1187
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:55,560
Simple Jack belong to us now.

1188
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:00,356
He does, does he?

1189
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:02,900
Let me tell you something, shitbird.

1190
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:05,445
I've never even heard
of your little agency.

1191
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:07,530
But if you think
you can poach my client...

1192
01:12:07,614 --> 01:12:12,160
Send $50 million, or you no see
Simple Jack again because we kill him.

1193
01:12:12,244 --> 01:12:13,745
This is Les Grossman. Who is this?

1194
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:16,164
This is Flaming Dragon!

1195
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:19,042
Okay. Flaming Dragon. Fuckface.

1196
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:23,963
First, take a big step back
and literally fuck your own face!

1197
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:28,092
Now, I don't know what kind of
pan-Pacific bullshit power play

1198
01:12:28,218 --> 01:12:30,636
you're trying to pull here,
but Asia, Jack, is my territory.

1199
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,055
So whatever you're thinking,
you better think again.

1200
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:33,514
Otherwise, I'm gonna
have to head down there,

1201
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:36,976
and I will rain down an ungodly
fucking firestorm upon you.

1202
01:12:37,102 --> 01:12:38,728
You're gonna have to call
the fucking United Nations

1203
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:42,857
and get a fucking binding resolution
to keep me from fucking destroying you.

1204
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:45,568
I am talking scorched earth,
motherfucker!

1205
01:12:45,652 --> 01:12:47,445
I will massacre you!

1206
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:49,447
I will fuck you up!

1207
01:12:57,289 --> 01:12:58,998
- Could you find out who that was? Go.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1208
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:37,453
You wear these.
More like Simple Jack teeth.

1209
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:39,288
Okay.

1210
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:42,041
Hey. Look, I know you're a big fan,
and that's great...

1211
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:46,796
Put teeth in!

1212
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:55,721
Now do movie.

1213
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:57,515
The whole movie?

1214
01:13:57,641 --> 01:13:59,267
I can't. I don't know the whole...

1215
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:01,853
You perferm! You perferm or die!

1216
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:04,147
Monkey swine!

1217
01:14:07,025 --> 01:14:08,401
Pa.

1218
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:11,737
More stupid!

1219
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:18,578
Pa, why you gotta make me feel bad?

1220
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:22,373
You saw what I saw.

1221
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:25,042
Tugg Speedman is dead meat
if we don't do something soon.

1222
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:27,545
Yeah. We could do something
by getting our asses back to the hotel,

1223
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:28,963
which is in the other direction!

1224
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:30,673
Ain't right.

1225
01:14:30,757 --> 01:14:32,800
What would've happened
in The Great Escape

1226
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:36,721
if Steve McQueen and them dudes
had turned tail and ran?

1227
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:40,850
Well, that's what that movie was about.
They were escaping. They ran away.

1228
01:14:40,934 --> 01:14:43,561
I'm trying to agree with you.
The point is they did something.

1229
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:44,896
Then what are we supposed to do, huh?

1230
01:14:45,022 --> 01:14:48,900
'Cause he's cleaning a gun
with no bullets. Yeah, that's a plan.

1231
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:53,112
I'm just like a little boy,
playing with his dick when he's nervous.

1232
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:58,826
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1233
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:01,996
I got an idea.
This might be a little crazy.

1234
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,081
Crazy's better than nothing.

1235
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:08,127
Back in '98, I did a low-budget
titty comedy for Skinemax.

1236
01:15:08,253 --> 01:15:11,589
- Sex Camp. Remember it?
- Yeah.

1237
01:15:11,715 --> 01:15:15,635
Anyway, me and the campers
from the uncool camp

1238
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:18,262
had to break into the rich girl camp.

1239
01:15:18,388 --> 01:15:20,097
So, what we did,

1240
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:23,184
we built a catapult
out of logs and underwear,

1241
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:26,896
and they shot us over the wall,
and we parachuted down.

1242
01:15:32,444 --> 01:15:33,819
Look,

1243
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,988
you guys, we already know the plan.

1244
01:15:36,114 --> 01:15:38,074
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm giving you gold.

1245
01:15:38,158 --> 01:15:42,537
We do it just like in the book,
Chapter 26, the Wet Offensive.

1246
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:45,039
The book of Tropic Thunder.

1247
01:15:45,123 --> 01:15:47,416
Yeah, did you guys read the book?

1248
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:51,295
The flap, I read the back flap
and saw the pictures.

1249
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:55,216
Well, it's okay.
It's exactly the same as in the script.

1250
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,425
Cool.

1251
01:15:58,303 --> 01:16:00,930
You guys all read the script, right?

1252
01:16:01,014 --> 01:16:03,140
I don't read the script, script reads me.

1253
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:05,768
What the hell does that even mean?

1254
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:09,272
What you getting at with the books,
scripts? Spit that shit out, man!

1255
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:14,443
All right. The Wet Offensive.

1256
01:16:15,445 --> 01:16:18,322
Osiris and Fats go undercover
as a diversion.

1257
01:16:18,448 --> 01:16:20,783
Motown and Brooklyn sneak in
via the river.

1258
01:16:20,867 --> 01:16:23,327
Yeah. But those dudes
was trained soldiers.

1259
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:26,205
Yeah!

1260
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:30,293
And we trained actors, motherfucker.

1261
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:34,714
Time to man up.
And I ain't gonna sugarcoat.

1262
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,592
Some of us
might not even make it back.

1263
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:40,845
What do you mean?
Like not on the same flight?

1264
01:16:43,515 --> 01:16:46,267
Alpa and I's already wearing
earth mama's natural night camo.

1265
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:48,185
- Cool it, Benson.
- Sorry.

1266
01:16:49,229 --> 01:16:53,858
We gonna scout, get a plan together.
We ain't back in 20, come looking.

1267
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:57,194
We are Flaming Dragon.

1268
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:02,158
Okay.

1269
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:06,537
Flaming Dragon's
a heroin manufacturer.

1270
01:17:06,663 --> 01:17:09,707
They're responsible
for an eighth of the drug trade in Asia.

1271
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:13,044
- Huge profit margin.
- Guys!

1272
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:16,088
Would somebody please let me know
what the game plan is?

1273
01:17:16,214 --> 01:17:17,923
Peck! We have it handled.

1274
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:20,551
Please, don't interrupt.
Everything's under control.

1275
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:22,678
I got it. Got it.

1276
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:37,026
- Les Grossman.
- We not get money yet.

1277
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:39,654
Price now 100 million!

1278
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:42,573
You pay now,
or tomorrow Simple Jack die.

1279
01:17:42,699 --> 01:17:45,743
Great. Let me get this down.

1280
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:47,328
100 million.

1281
01:17:47,412 --> 01:17:49,914
Wait! I got a better idea.

1282
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,500
Instead of 100 million,

1283
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:55,503
how about I send you
a hobo's dick cheese?

1284
01:17:55,587 --> 01:17:57,922
Then you kill him! Do your thing!
Skin the fucking bastard!

1285
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:00,174
Go to town, man! Go to town!

1286
01:18:00,258 --> 01:18:02,426
- No...
- In the meantime, and as usual,

1287
01:18:02,552 --> 01:18:04,261
go fuck yourself!

1288
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:07,932
- No.
- We don't negotiate with terrorists.

1289
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:12,770
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, are you insane?

1290
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:14,689
- I think I could've done that better.
- I thought it was good.

1291
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:16,607
They're gonna kill him!

1292
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:20,778
And?

1293
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:24,281
"And?"

1294
01:18:25,617 --> 01:18:29,620
It's a cold, hard world. Shit happens.

1295
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:35,126
We'll weep for him, in the press.

1296
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:37,962
Set up a scholarship in his name.

1297
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:41,966
Eventually, and I'm talking way,
way down the road,

1298
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:43,634
we file an insurance claim.

1299
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:46,470
Preferably before
the end of the fiscal year.

1300
01:18:46,596 --> 01:18:50,307
Actually, the claim alone would net us
more than the movie would lose.

1301
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:54,228
You can't be serious.

1302
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:56,981
You kick in the door to my house,

1303
01:18:57,107 --> 01:19:02,570
all ants in your pants,
sucking my left nut to get a TiVo scrap

1304
01:19:02,654 --> 01:19:07,324
for the third runner-up
Sexiest Man Alive 1998,

1305
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:09,785
and you're asking if I'm serious?

1306
01:19:13,623 --> 01:19:15,332
Let's face it.

1307
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:19,503
The kids aren't dressing up as Scorcher
for Purim anymore.

1308
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:23,841
Speedman is a dying star,

1309
01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:27,178
a white dwarf heading for a black hole.

1310
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:30,014
That's physics. It's inevitable.

1311
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:33,517
We've been handed
an incredible opportunity here, Peck.

1312
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:37,438
The universe is talking to us right now.

1313
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:39,106
You just gotta listen.

1314
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:55,790
See, this is the good part, Pecker.
This is when the job gets fun.

1315
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:57,041
Yeah.

1316
01:19:57,125 --> 01:20:00,294
Ask and you shall receive.

1317
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:05,466
- All right.
- You play ball, we play ball.

1318
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:08,886
I know you want the goodies.

1319
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:11,055
Welcome to the goody room.

1320
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:15,726
You paying attention?
'Cause I'm talking G5 for the Pecker.

1321
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:17,144
That's how you're gonna roll.

1322
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:21,232
No more frequent flier
bitch miles for my boy.

1323
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:22,566
Yeah!

1324
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:24,401
Playa.

1325
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,570
Playa!

1326
01:20:27,572 --> 01:20:28,906
Big dick playa.

1327
01:20:29,032 --> 01:20:30,991
Swinging past your knees!

1328
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:32,159
Big dick, baby.

1329
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:33,410
Yep.

1330
01:20:36,748 --> 01:20:39,416
Or you can grow a conscience

1331
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:41,877
in the next five minutes
and see where that takes you.

1332
01:20:46,758 --> 01:20:48,926
Let me get this straight.

1333
01:20:49,052 --> 01:20:52,680
You want me
to let my client of 15 years,

1334
01:20:52,764 --> 01:20:54,098
one of my best friends,

1335
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:58,894
die in the jungle, alone,
for some money and a G5?

1336
01:20:59,938 --> 01:21:01,105
Yes.

1337
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:08,445
A G5 airplane?

1338
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:11,615
Yes.

1339
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:15,452
And lots of money.

1340
01:21:16,788 --> 01:21:18,956
Playa.

1341
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:23,085
Yeah!

1342
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:26,922
Smack it up, flip it, rub it down!

1343
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:32,136
But Mama take care of Jack a lot.

1344
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:36,724
How many more sleeps
before she wakes up again?

1345
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:38,309
Sorry, Jack.

1346
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:40,728
She in heaven now.

1347
01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:44,732
Damn! I thought the movie was bad.

1348
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:47,985
She sleep forever.

1349
01:21:48,111 --> 01:21:51,238
To the man's credit, he's actually
eased up on the retard throttle.

1350
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:54,909
And now that's added a balance,
and the audience can connect.

1351
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:58,829
I mean, this is Theater 101,
but, you know, he's had a tough road.

1352
01:21:58,955 --> 01:22:00,080
He'll become a naturalist.

1353
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:01,832
- Yeah.
- Break down the aesthetic distance,

1354
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:03,667
then the...

1355
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:08,005
Told you I'd tag you back.

1356
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:12,927
Can I tell you that I'm sorry

1357
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:15,346
for any offense I might've caused, man?

1358
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:17,848
- I just got caught up in...
- In being a dumbass?

1359
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:19,350
I guess so.

1360
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:22,102
Why you still doing this
Chicken George shit, I have no idea.

1361
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:23,520
- Neither do I.
- It's beyond me.

1362
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:25,856
- It's beyond me.
- You confused.

1363
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,858
- I am a little confused.
- I know.

1364
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:31,278
But are we cool?

1365
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:32,696
Not really.

1366
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:38,118
Hey, man.

1367
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:39,870
- How's it going?
- Good. Yourself?

1368
01:22:39,996 --> 01:22:42,039
Hey, so, if it's no big deal,

1369
01:22:42,165 --> 01:22:45,042
I think I'm just gonna hang back here
for the mission.

1370
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:46,710
Watch the stuff.

1371
01:22:46,836 --> 01:22:48,879
- Is that cool?
- What? No!

1372
01:22:49,005 --> 01:22:50,881
We need you, Jeff.

1373
01:22:51,007 --> 01:22:52,549
What are you talking about?

1374
01:22:52,676 --> 01:22:54,218
Okay, look, man.

1375
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,805
- I got something to tell you.
- Okay.

1376
01:23:00,016 --> 01:23:02,768
You know those jellybeans
I was eating?

1377
01:23:02,852 --> 01:23:05,980
Well, they werent jellybeans, okay?

1378
01:23:06,856 --> 01:23:09,692
- They were drugs.
- Really?

1379
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:14,154
I get down there near the mother lode,
I am done. I'm jonesing bad, man.

1380
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:17,199
I'm gonna fucking do all the heroin
in the fucking world.

1381
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:24,665
If you guys wanna make it through
this thing, you gotta strap me to a tree.

1382
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:29,795
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious. Literally, a tree.

1383
01:23:29,879 --> 01:23:32,798
And you can, no matter what, you can't
fucking untie me until it is done,

1384
01:23:32,882 --> 01:23:34,466
until it is out of my system.

1385
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:36,176
I'm gonna say,
"Hey, man, I'm cool. It's cool.

1386
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:37,845
"I'm finally better. I'm finally better.
Untie me."

1387
01:23:37,929 --> 01:23:41,140
Don't listen to me!
Anything I fucking say is a lie!

1388
01:23:41,224 --> 01:23:42,599
You got it!

1389
01:23:43,226 --> 01:23:45,310
Goodbye, Mama!

1390
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:48,564
Now you can have ice cream in heaven.

1391
01:23:48,648 --> 01:23:53,652
I'll see you tonight, when I go to bed,
in my head movies.

1392
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:59,158
But this head movie
makes my eyes rain.

1393
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:11,462
Dang.
Short-bus is taking some real hits.

1394
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:16,133
- They got him on the move!
- That's torture, man.

1395
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:19,136
Okay. That's where they keeping him.

1396
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:21,430
I gotta get cracking on my costume.

1397
01:24:21,514 --> 01:24:22,931
Say, are you good
with a needle and thread?

1398
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:24,058
Hell, yeah.

1399
01:24:24,142 --> 01:24:27,519
Alpa Chino chinos sold more than
five million pairs last spring at the Gap.

1400
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:30,314
- I sewed them patterns myself, baby.
- Let's roll out.

1401
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:04,556
It's a little twig man Oscar.

1402
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:13,565
I'm going to call you Half Squat.

1403
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:17,236
And you can call me

1404
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:19,571
Papa.

1405
01:25:43,054 --> 01:25:44,805
Wow, look at all those stars.

1406
01:25:46,766 --> 01:25:48,767
Really makes a guy feel pretty small.

1407
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:52,855
This could be the last time
we look at these stars.

1408
01:25:53,773 --> 01:25:55,274
Man, that's beauty.

1409
01:25:57,193 --> 01:26:00,279
Nights like tonight
make a man wonder what it's all about.

1410
01:26:00,363 --> 01:26:02,698
Hey, you guys.
Anybody got some bug spray?

1411
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:05,659
Don't ignore me!

1412
01:26:05,743 --> 01:26:08,620
Stick it out, man.
We're gonna get through this.

1413
01:26:09,747 --> 01:26:11,832
- Hey, Kirk?
- Yeah?

1414
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:14,793
Are you still dating
Jennifer Love Hewitt?

1415
01:26:14,878 --> 01:26:16,295
'Cause I think she's hot.

1416
01:26:16,379 --> 01:26:19,756
No, that was just some
tabloid conjecture.

1417
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:23,844
Hey, guys, I'm good. I made it through.
You can untie me now.

1418
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:26,263
Funny, huh?

1419
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:29,266
The circus life 280 days a year
on location.

1420
01:26:30,476 --> 01:26:33,395
It's hard to find a girl
that can hang with that, you know?

1421
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:37,274
Not one worth keeping, nohow.

1422
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:39,651
Hey, Radar? Evans?

1423
01:26:39,736 --> 01:26:40,819
No, it's Kevin.

1424
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:42,654
Kev, whatever the fuck.
Come over here.

1425
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:44,990
I didn't tell you, but Fatties: Fart Three
is coming down the pike,

1426
01:26:45,074 --> 01:26:48,619
and there's a role in there for you
if you come over and untie me.

1427
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:51,288
Jeff, you're just going to
have to tough it out.

1428
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:53,332
Your mother's a cankerous whore!

1429
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:54,791
Jesus, man.

1430
01:26:55,793 --> 01:26:57,294
Hey, man.

1431
01:26:57,378 --> 01:27:00,297
Remember way back when I said
your mother was a cankerous whore?

1432
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:03,800
I'm sorry, man.
I did not mean that. She's not.

1433
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:05,594
How about you, man?

1434
01:27:05,678 --> 01:27:08,138
You got some little minx waiting for you
on the other side of tomorrow?

1435
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:09,723
Me?

1436
01:27:09,807 --> 01:27:12,601
I've barely even had a girlfriend, and...

1437
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:17,105
I was really hoping I'd get laid
when this movie came out,

1438
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:19,608
but that's not gonna happen.

1439
01:27:20,443 --> 01:27:21,944
What about you, Masterblaster?

1440
01:27:22,028 --> 01:27:24,655
You got a certain someone you trying
to get with back in the States?

1441
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:29,493
What, Alpa Chino?
He's like 10 girls deep, 24/7.

1442
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:30,827
No. You missing me, man.

1443
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:32,746
I'm talking about something special.
Big difference.

1444
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:34,039
How about it?

1445
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:35,958
Yeah.

1446
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:39,336
Yeah, there is.

1447
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:42,756
Well? What's the skinny?
Y'all been on a date or what?

1448
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,758
No. I mean...

1449
01:27:44,842 --> 01:27:49,680
I always wanted to, but I guess
I just never had the courage to ask.

1450
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:51,515
It's... lt's complicated.

1451
01:27:51,599 --> 01:27:54,017
No! It's simple as pie, man.

1452
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:56,728
You plant your feet in the ground, you
look her square in the eyes, you say,

1453
01:27:56,813 --> 01:28:00,482
"Hey, baby, you and me's going
on a date." That's the end of story.

1454
01:28:00,566 --> 01:28:03,277
- What's her name?
- Lance.

1455
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:05,153
"Listen here, Lance..."

1456
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:09,825
Lance? What the fuck did I just hear?
Lance?

1457
01:28:09,909 --> 01:28:11,660
- Did you say "Lance"?
- No!

1458
01:28:11,744 --> 01:28:13,704
- That sounded like "Lance."
- No, I said "Nance."

1459
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,956
- That's what I said, "Nance."
- It sounded like "Lance."

1460
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:17,582
Look, I'm Alpa Chino, okay?

1461
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:19,376
I love the pussy! All right?

1462
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,378
Lay your ass back down
and look at the stars.

1463
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:22,838
When you wrote I Love Tha Pussy

1464
01:28:22,922 --> 01:28:26,300
was you thinking of dangling your dice
on Lance's forehead?

1465
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:28,760
Oh, hell, no! What? Come on. Look.

1466
01:28:28,845 --> 01:28:31,805
- Man, everyone's gay once in a while.
- I'm not gay!

1467
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:32,931
This Hollywood.

1468
01:28:33,016 --> 01:28:34,099
How about we all get back to work?

1469
01:28:34,183 --> 01:28:35,892
- Okay. Cool.
- This is ridiculous!

1470
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:38,895
We got a big day tomorrow.
Let's get focused.

1471
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:46,278
Alpa, if you untie me,
I will literally suck your dick right now.

1472
01:28:46,362 --> 01:28:49,614
I told you, for the last time,
I love the pussy!

1473
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:53,827
I'll cradle the balls, stroke the shaft,

1474
01:28:53,911 --> 01:28:57,039
work the pipe and swallow the gravy.

1475
01:28:57,123 --> 01:28:59,207
Get it over here, buddy. Let's do this.

1476
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:06,840
Okay, so, what's the plan?

1477
01:29:06,924 --> 01:29:08,342
Are you gonna talk Vietnamese
to those dudes?

1478
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:10,218
No. No. Mandarin Chinese.

1479
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:12,012
Which, from what I can tell,
is what they speaking down there.

1480
01:29:12,096 --> 01:29:13,680
How the hell do you know Chinese?

1481
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:17,267
Land of Silk and Money with Gong Li.
Second Globe, third Oscar.

1482
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:21,313
Prepped for that one by working in
a Beijing textile factory for eight months.

1483
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:23,357
That might be our ride.

1484
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:41,333
The straps are too tight!

1485
01:29:41,417 --> 01:29:43,794
Shut your mouth and follow my lead.

1486
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:14,658
The straps are cutting off
my circulation!

1487
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:15,826
Fuck you!

1488
01:30:23,334 --> 01:30:26,169
Not the fucking bull again.
Fucking asshole.

1489
01:31:20,183 --> 01:31:22,893
Laz, don't let him take me off the yak.

1490
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:29,691
Bitch whore! Fucking hate you!

1491
01:31:39,785 --> 01:31:40,869
Okay.

1492
01:31:43,206 --> 01:31:44,789
All right.

1493
01:31:44,874 --> 01:31:47,292
That looks like it could be
the munitions hut right there.

1494
01:31:47,376 --> 01:31:49,461
I'm gonna try to find Speedman
in the main building.

1495
01:32:07,396 --> 01:32:11,066
I don't know Chinese but it sounds like
your improvising is for shit.

1496
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:12,275
Oh, fuck!

1497
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:29,417
Get over here!

1498
01:32:30,753 --> 01:32:32,337
- What are you guys doing here?
- He has hands.

1499
01:32:32,421 --> 01:32:34,839
- He killed Damien.
- Bullshit!

1500
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:37,467
- He blinded Jamie Lee Curtis.
- Almost!

1501
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:40,762
What are you talking about?
Damien stepped on a old landmine.

1502
01:32:40,846 --> 01:32:42,430
Sweet. Thank God.

1503
01:32:42,515 --> 01:32:44,724
- We busting Speedman out.
- Speedman's here?

1504
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:15,505
I take it y'all are doing
the Wet Offensive from the book.

1505
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:16,840
I can give y'all a diversion.

1506
01:33:16,924 --> 01:33:20,885
I got enough shit here to light this place
up like it's the Fourth of fucking July.

1507
01:34:02,345 --> 01:34:04,846
Yes, your farm.

1508
01:34:09,185 --> 01:34:11,603
Where is your farm,

1509
01:34:13,147 --> 01:34:14,648
American?

1510
01:34:17,443 --> 01:34:18,735
My farm?

1511
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:21,946
Oh, shit.

1512
01:34:22,698 --> 01:34:25,909
Here's my motherfucking farm!

1513
01:34:25,993 --> 01:34:27,535
Yeah!

1514
01:34:32,416 --> 01:34:35,460
Yeah! Chicka-chickaw, baby!

1515
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:37,671
Kwan-Lo!

1516
01:34:39,131 --> 01:34:41,091
I'm a lead farmer, motherfucker!

1517
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:42,759
Yeah!

1518
01:34:44,261 --> 01:34:47,514
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
keep your head down!

1519
01:34:47,598 --> 01:34:49,891
Keep your head down on the ground!

1520
01:34:49,975 --> 01:34:52,143
Nobody move or I do the little big guy!

1521
01:34:52,228 --> 01:34:55,689
That's right,
we running this program now, J.P.

1522
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:58,441
Now show me where the drugs are.

1523
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:00,318
What the fuck?

1524
01:35:00,403 --> 01:35:02,112
That ain't the plan!

1525
01:35:02,196 --> 01:35:03,947
Dont judge me!

1526
01:35:07,576 --> 01:35:09,369
He's got a real serious problem.

1527
01:35:10,121 --> 01:35:12,455
Hey! Hey, you!

1528
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:16,501
Take off your clothes!

1529
01:35:16,585 --> 01:35:17,919
What do we do now?

1530
01:35:18,003 --> 01:35:19,838
Stick with the plan. Find Speedman.

1531
01:35:19,922 --> 01:35:22,340
Alpa, keep this clown posse down.
Come on now.

1532
01:35:22,425 --> 01:35:25,802
Y'all heard the man.
Be suede, don't move!

1533
01:35:25,886 --> 01:35:27,804
Fuck your do-rag. Fuck your do-rag.

1534
01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:30,432
- Door!
- One, two, three!

1535
01:35:43,654 --> 01:35:45,530
I go high, you go low.

1536
01:35:49,869 --> 01:35:53,788
Get down. Get down! Get down!
Chow Yun-Fat, get the hell down!

1537
01:35:53,873 --> 01:35:57,167
If I see one more head pop up,
it's gonna be bullet Whac-A-Mole.

1538
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:00,170
Come on, come on!

1539
01:36:00,254 --> 01:36:02,297
- Smoke grenade.
- Don't drop it now.

1540
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:04,507
Here.

1541
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:07,010
- What's this?
- I don't know what it's called.

1542
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:09,721
I just know the sound it makes
when it lies.

1543
01:36:09,805 --> 01:36:13,349
Don't move, Matchbox,
or I will shoot you.

1544
01:36:13,434 --> 01:36:16,352
I'm gonna put on this thing. Don't move.

1545
01:36:16,437 --> 01:36:18,188
I can still see you.

1546
01:36:24,278 --> 01:36:25,403
Tugg!

1547
01:36:27,907 --> 01:36:29,115
Tugg?

1548
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:32,368
Gotcha.

1549
01:36:33,537 --> 01:36:36,456
Roll your shit up, man. We going home.

1550
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:37,707
Home?

1551
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:43,671
But I'm doing five shows a day
for a standing-room-only crowd.

1552
01:36:43,756 --> 01:36:46,341
Don't you get it? I already am home.

1553
01:36:48,594 --> 01:36:51,763
All right, now, dude, you gotta get it...

1554
01:36:51,847 --> 01:36:54,057
My son gave this to me.

1555
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:57,685
- That's your stick buddy?
- His name is Twigman.

1556
01:36:57,770 --> 01:36:59,604
Does he wanna come with us?

1557
01:37:20,584 --> 01:37:22,752
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1558
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:27,799
Maybe y'all heard of me.
Y'all heard of Alpa Chino? No?

1559
01:37:27,883 --> 01:37:30,385
I love that pussy, hell, yeah, hell, yeah

1560
01:37:30,469 --> 01:37:31,594
They're not your demo, dude.

1561
01:37:32,054 --> 01:37:34,472
Come on.
Six motherfucking VMAs, baby.

1562
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:37,767
Two BET Awards. Alpa Chino.

1563
01:37:37,852 --> 01:37:44,274
Like him in Carlito's Way?

1564
01:37:44,608 --> 01:37:47,318
Hey, yo, you know what?
Speak English. I don't speak that stuff.

1565
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:49,362
What're you sayin'? Huh?

1566
01:37:49,446 --> 01:37:54,033
Devil's Advocate. Dog Day Affernoon.

1567
01:37:54,368 --> 01:37:57,245
Cruising. Sea of Love.

1568
01:37:57,329 --> 01:38:00,331
Real Al Pacino.

1569
01:38:00,416 --> 01:38:04,043
Get the fuck down. That's a whole
different dude altogether.

1570
01:38:04,128 --> 01:38:07,213
What you doing? What you doing?
Don't touch that gun.

1571
01:38:07,298 --> 01:38:08,715
Don't do it! Don't touch that gun!

1572
01:38:08,799 --> 01:38:11,134
On my momma, if you touch that gun...

1573
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:18,141
- Oh, shit, it's on!
- Over here!

1574
01:38:52,509 --> 01:38:54,344
- What're you doing?
- I'm gonna give these boys

1575
01:38:54,428 --> 01:38:56,054
a Hanoi high-five.

1576
01:39:08,692 --> 01:39:10,068
Shadow me, Pinocchio!

1577
01:39:10,819 --> 01:39:12,070
Smoke!

1578
01:39:17,868 --> 01:39:19,619
Oh, shit!

1579
01:39:24,416 --> 01:39:26,000
Jeff, don't!

1580
01:39:26,794 --> 01:39:28,836
It doesn't matter what I do.

1581
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:31,881
I'll always be a screw-up.
No one'll ever respect me.

1582
01:39:31,966 --> 01:39:36,010
That is not true, you are not a screw-up!
You make so many people laugh.

1583
01:39:36,095 --> 01:39:38,346
They only laugh at my farts.

1584
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:40,431
Jeff, we really need to go now!

1585
01:39:40,516 --> 01:39:42,141
This is all I deserve!

1586
01:40:02,246 --> 01:40:04,539
Laugh at that, you bastards!

1587
01:40:04,623 --> 01:40:08,042
Hilarious! Hilarious!

1588
01:40:09,545 --> 01:40:12,422
Let's move. We only have 16 hours
before they wake up.

1589
01:40:28,647 --> 01:40:30,273
Sounds like the dinner bell's ringing.

1590
01:40:30,357 --> 01:40:33,317
These assholes are gonna be crawling
in here ready to fucking eat us.

1591
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:39,115
There. All right, you keep six right here.

1592
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:43,244
Come on, let's go.

1593
01:40:43,328 --> 01:40:45,288
Come on, what are you guys doing?
Let's get out of here!

1594
01:40:45,372 --> 01:40:47,040
He's on tilt status.

1595
01:40:47,124 --> 01:40:51,127
Same thing happened to me when
I played Neil Armstrong in Moonshot.

1596
01:40:51,211 --> 01:40:53,296
They found me in an alley in Burbank

1597
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:56,632
trying to re-enter the Earth's
atmosphere in an old refrigerator box.

1598
01:40:57,342 --> 01:40:58,468
What're you talking about?

1599
01:40:58,552 --> 01:41:00,928
Come on, fellas, we really need to go.

1600
01:41:01,013 --> 01:41:05,475
Daggomit, Blamtucky,
I ain't re-programming a VCR.

1601
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:13,608
Give me the flame thrower.
You gotta start the chopper.

1602
01:41:13,692 --> 01:41:17,153
- No, fuck that! Just give me this.
- No time! I'll take care of this!

1603
01:41:18,322 --> 01:41:20,281
All right. Give me your hooks.

1604
01:41:20,365 --> 01:41:21,991
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna put them on again.

1605
01:41:22,076 --> 01:41:24,952
- Just give me your goddamn hooks.
- All right. Here.

1606
01:41:25,037 --> 01:41:27,205
Get those boys back to the bird, pronto!

1607
01:41:32,127 --> 01:41:34,337
Shit! Enough!

1608
01:41:34,421 --> 01:41:36,339
Fake shit!

1609
01:41:39,384 --> 01:41:40,551
Fuck!

1610
01:41:48,227 --> 01:41:51,437
Go get your guys!
Get them to the chopper!

1611
01:41:51,522 --> 01:41:53,648
I'll take care of these yahoos!

1612
01:41:55,651 --> 01:41:57,944
You're gonna focus up now,
motherfucker, and say it.

1613
01:41:58,028 --> 01:42:00,196
- "It's me, Tugg!"
- It's me, Tugg.

1614
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:01,739
That's right! Now, Tugg who?

1615
01:42:01,824 --> 01:42:04,659
- Tugg who? I don't know. Who are you?
- Me?

1616
01:42:04,743 --> 01:42:06,452
I know who I am!

1617
01:42:06,537 --> 01:42:10,289
I'm a dude playing a dude
disguised as another dude.

1618
01:42:10,374 --> 01:42:11,457
What?

1619
01:42:11,542 --> 01:42:13,668
You a dude
that don't know what dude he is!

1620
01:42:13,752 --> 01:42:16,462
Or are you a dude who has no idea
what dude he is

1621
01:42:16,547 --> 01:42:17,839
and claims to know what dude he is...

1622
01:42:17,923 --> 01:42:19,715
What the fuck
are you guys talking about?

1623
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:20,883
...by playing other dudes?

1624
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:22,218
I know what dude I am!

1625
01:42:22,302 --> 01:42:25,096
- You're scared.
- I ain't scared. Scared of what?

1626
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:26,472
Or scared of who?

1627
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:29,183
- Scared of who?
- Come on, guys. We really need to go!

1628
01:42:29,268 --> 01:42:30,560
Scared of you.

1629
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:37,775
- Jesus.
- What's going on?

1630
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:39,402
The dudes are emerging.

1631
01:42:39,486 --> 01:42:40,862
He's right, you know.

1632
01:42:42,573 --> 01:42:44,031
I am not

1633
01:42:45,576 --> 01:42:47,285
Sergeant Lincoln Osiris.

1634
01:42:51,665 --> 01:42:53,166
We gotta roll out.

1635
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:56,502
Nor am I Father O'Malley.

1636
01:42:58,714 --> 01:43:01,674
Or Neil Armstrong.

1637
01:43:09,224 --> 01:43:11,434
I think I might be nobody.

1638
01:43:12,769 --> 01:43:13,978
Wow!

1639
01:43:14,062 --> 01:43:16,772
The insecurity level
with you guys is ridiculous!

1640
01:43:17,983 --> 01:43:20,985
- Everybody's got issues!
- Yeah, man, everybody got issues.

1641
01:43:21,069 --> 01:43:23,654
Come on! You're Kirk Lazarus.

1642
01:43:23,739 --> 01:43:25,948
You're the whole reason
I got into acting.

1643
01:43:26,033 --> 01:43:27,867
I memorized every single monologue

1644
01:43:27,951 --> 01:43:30,578
you ever did
when I was in theater school.

1645
01:43:30,662 --> 01:43:32,705
- Really?
- Yeah. And look, Tugg!

1646
01:43:32,789 --> 01:43:35,249
I saw Scorcher I
24 times when I was in eighth grade.

1647
01:43:35,334 --> 01:43:38,294
That shit blew me away!
I got high to that shit! You the man!

1648
01:43:38,378 --> 01:43:41,547
Yeah, man, Scorcher I was great.
Let's get the fuck out of here!

1649
01:43:41,632 --> 01:43:45,801
Tugg, Tugger, you're the last piece
of the puzzle, buddy.

1650
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:48,888
We need you! Your men need you!
Are you with us?

1651
01:43:53,185 --> 01:43:55,228
I'm a rooster illusion.

1652
01:43:55,312 --> 01:43:56,520
Fuck it. We'll deal with him later.

1653
01:43:56,605 --> 01:43:59,815
Let's move. Come on. Come on.
Double time. Gotta go!

1654
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:04,153
Come on, come on, come on.

1655
01:44:07,866 --> 01:44:09,825
Bingo! Move out.

1656
01:44:11,745 --> 01:44:13,162
Oh, God.

1657
01:44:15,082 --> 01:44:18,000
Just say no to this,
you drug-making midget.

1658
01:44:22,506 --> 01:44:24,006
Gotta hold on!

1659
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:31,555
Four Leaf!

1660
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:37,645
You grew hands?

1661
01:44:46,863 --> 01:44:48,406
RPG, gentlemen!

1662
01:44:51,159 --> 01:44:52,702
Where are you going?

1663
01:44:58,208 --> 01:45:00,751
Oh, my God.
I am moving to catering after this.

1664
01:45:22,733 --> 01:45:28,696
My ass!

1665
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:33,576
Hey, yo!
We gotta get our shit together, Tugg!

1666
01:45:33,660 --> 01:45:35,911
We gotta get his cracker ass
to the chopper!

1667
01:45:35,996 --> 01:45:40,291
Are you still crazy?
We gotta get Candisky to the chopper!

1668
01:45:40,375 --> 01:45:41,876
It's Sandusky.

1669
01:45:43,712 --> 01:45:47,048
- Kevin Sandusky.
- That's my name.

1670
01:45:47,132 --> 01:45:48,758
You remembered my name.

1671
01:45:48,842 --> 01:45:50,885
Alpa, go help Cody.

1672
01:45:50,969 --> 01:45:52,970
Portnoy, get Sandusky
back to the chopper. Go!

1673
01:45:53,055 --> 01:45:54,930
- I got him!
- Let's go!

1674
01:45:56,308 --> 01:45:57,892
Let's get out of here!

1675
01:46:09,738 --> 01:46:11,280
Hey, Leaf!

1676
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:12,615
- Leaf!
- Yeah.

1677
01:46:12,699 --> 01:46:13,783
Hit the plunger

1678
01:46:13,867 --> 01:46:15,076
- as soon as they clear the bridge!
- Got it!

1679
01:46:20,207 --> 01:46:22,666
Come on! Get in the chopper!

1680
01:46:22,834 --> 01:46:25,669
- Come on! Move!
- Kirk! Wait!

1681
01:46:30,175 --> 01:46:31,842
Laz, I'm gonna blow the bridge!

1682
01:46:31,927 --> 01:46:33,761
Are you the special effects guy?

1683
01:46:33,845 --> 01:46:35,971
- You God damn right I am.
- Fuck yeah!

1684
01:46:36,348 --> 01:46:37,598
Leaf's about to blow the bridge.
Come on!

1685
01:46:37,682 --> 01:46:40,309
You don't have to! You don't have to!
I'm staying.

1686
01:46:40,394 --> 01:46:41,894
No, I can't let you do that, mate.
We gotta go.

1687
01:46:41,978 --> 01:46:44,522
No, I'm telling you, I'm not being crazy.
They'll listen to me.

1688
01:46:44,606 --> 01:46:47,149
I know it sounds weird,
but I have a connection with them.

1689
01:46:47,234 --> 01:46:50,027
You're not doing tofu dinner theater
for these motherfuckers. Let's roll!

1690
01:46:50,112 --> 01:46:53,989
- Get over here!
- I have a son now. Little Half Squat.

1691
01:46:54,074 --> 01:46:55,658
Who in crikey fuck is Half Squat?

1692
01:46:55,742 --> 01:46:57,993
He's my son. He's my boy!

1693
01:46:58,078 --> 01:47:00,496
He needs me. I have to go back to him.

1694
01:47:03,625 --> 01:47:05,334
You tell the world what happened here.

1695
01:47:05,419 --> 01:47:07,253
What happened here?

1696
01:47:07,337 --> 01:47:09,588
I don't know, but you need to tell them.

1697
01:47:11,925 --> 01:47:13,801
I got this.

1698
01:47:13,885 --> 01:47:15,052
Tugg!

1699
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:19,348
You take care of the boys!
I'll deal with these guys.

1700
01:47:20,684 --> 01:47:24,353
Where is he going?
We're gonna fucking die!

1701
01:47:24,438 --> 01:47:27,064
Laz, come on. He joined the circus.
Let's go.

1702
01:47:27,149 --> 01:47:28,357
- You've got hands.
- Yeah.

1703
01:47:28,442 --> 01:47:30,609
- Fuck! You've got hands?
- Come on!

1704
01:47:31,653 --> 01:47:32,820
- Come on!
- Get in!

1705
01:47:32,904 --> 01:47:34,530
- Come on!
- He's staying?

1706
01:47:34,614 --> 01:47:36,907
Go! He's a lost cause, mate!
Get out of here!

1707
01:47:41,455 --> 01:47:46,000
I was wrong! Blow the bridge!
Blow the fucking bridge!

1708
01:47:51,798 --> 01:47:53,215
I got this.

1709
01:47:53,884 --> 01:47:55,342
Leaf, no!

1710
01:48:39,429 --> 01:48:42,097
It's over! He's gone!

1711
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:44,266
Cody! We gotta go!

1712
01:48:46,269 --> 01:48:47,478
Look.

1713
01:49:10,085 --> 01:49:11,460
Think he's done.

1714
01:49:11,545 --> 01:49:12,795
Cover me!

1715
01:49:13,797 --> 01:49:16,799
- Come on!
- Wait, come back!

1716
01:49:16,883 --> 01:49:18,634
How do we cover him?

1717
01:49:22,806 --> 01:49:26,267
All right, game over. Come on, mate.
Come on.

1718
01:49:26,351 --> 01:49:28,978
- You all right, man?
- I'm cold.

1719
01:49:29,062 --> 01:49:31,063
I can't feel my legs.

1720
01:49:31,147 --> 01:49:34,108
No, no, they're in a puddle, mate. See?
There's a puddle right there.

1721
01:49:34,192 --> 01:49:35,401
- No worries.
- Good.

1722
01:49:35,485 --> 01:49:36,819
Come on, we gotta split, man.

1723
01:49:36,903 --> 01:49:39,196
- You guys came back for me.
- Course.

1724
01:49:39,281 --> 01:49:41,657
Hey! I want you to know something.

1725
01:49:41,741 --> 01:49:42,950
What?

1726
01:49:44,077 --> 01:49:45,911
I know who you are.

1727
01:49:47,998 --> 01:49:49,790
You're my friend.

1728
01:49:52,002 --> 01:49:53,669
You're my brother.

1729
01:49:54,504 --> 01:49:57,381
But like a really cool brother, you know?

1730
01:49:57,465 --> 01:49:58,841
Like a brother
where there was no animosity or...

1731
01:49:58,925 --> 01:50:01,802
Don't look now,
you got some real tears going.

1732
01:50:01,886 --> 01:50:02,970
Really?

1733
01:50:03,054 --> 01:50:04,513
That's the stuff
that accolades are made of.

1734
01:50:04,598 --> 01:50:06,056
Jesus, let's go, man!

1735
01:50:06,141 --> 01:50:07,641
All right?

1736
01:50:09,185 --> 01:50:10,644
Upsy-daisy.

1737
01:50:12,355 --> 01:50:15,399
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

1738
01:50:17,527 --> 01:50:18,861
Get in! Get in!

1739
01:50:18,945 --> 01:50:20,988
Come on! Here we go!

1740
01:50:23,491 --> 01:50:26,327
Tuggernuts! I got it!

1741
01:50:28,663 --> 01:50:30,998
- Tugger!
- Rick!

1742
01:50:33,543 --> 01:50:34,835
What the fuck?

1743
01:50:34,919 --> 01:50:36,545
I got the TiVo!

1744
01:50:37,422 --> 01:50:41,884
My friend wants a TiVo,
my friend gets a TiVo!

1745
01:50:47,015 --> 01:50:48,307
Oh, shit!

1746
01:51:25,095 --> 01:51:27,179
And the Oscar goes to...

1747
01:51:29,891 --> 01:51:32,226
Yes! Tugg Speedman.

1748
01:51:33,812 --> 01:51:36,563
"Tropic Blunder,
The True Story Behind the Making

1749
01:51:36,648 --> 01:51:39,191
"of the Most Expensive
Fake True War Story Ever."

1750
01:51:40,735 --> 01:51:41,902
Yeah!

1751
01:51:46,574 --> 01:51:48,492
Yeah, you son of a bitch!

1752
01:52:07,804 --> 01:52:12,182
Eight Oscars, $400 million

1753
01:52:12,267 --> 01:52:15,519
and you saved
Tugg Speedman's career.

1754
01:52:15,603 --> 01:52:18,480
I couldn't have done it
without you, Slolom.

1755
01:52:20,483 --> 01:52:21,650
Really?

1756
01:52:21,735 --> 01:52:23,736
No, dickhead, of course I could.

1757
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:26,488
- A nutless monkey could do your job.
- Well, I...

1758
01:52:26,573 --> 01:52:29,491
Now, go get drunk
and take credit at all the parties.

1759
01:52:29,576 --> 01:52:32,327
- I would never do that to...
- Joking.

1760
01:52:32,412 --> 01:52:33,787
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1761
01:52:33,872 --> 01:52:36,081
Very... Okay, there he is.

1762
01:52:36,166 --> 01:52:37,666
- There he is. Okay.
- Go have fun.

1763
01:52:37,751 --> 01:52:39,334
All right. We're having a...

1764
01:52:39,419 --> 01:52:41,837
Fuck, okay. Thank you, Les.
Thank you. You have a good night...

1765
01:52:41,921 --> 01:52:44,339
But seriously,
a nutless monkey could do your job.

1766
01:52:44,424 --> 01:52:46,175
Good. Thank you, sir.
