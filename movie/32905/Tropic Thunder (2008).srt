I am your brother.

161
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,959
I'm sorry. Could we cut?

162
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:15,555
- What's he saying?
- Damien, can we cut?

163
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:17,328
- No. No, no, no, no, no...
- All right, you know what?

164
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:20,427
We got the jets coming in,
big explosion, two minutes.

165
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:21,631
Still rolling.

166
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,367
You know what? No, not still rolling.
Can we cut?

167
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:25,136
- We're cutting.
- No, we're not. Get out!

168
00:12:25,243 --> 00:12:27,211
Hey, what's going on?
For real, my butt is hurting!

169
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:29,439
This harness is riding up my crack!

170
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,016
- Damien, are we cutting?
- No! No! Still rolling!

171
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:34,244
Mr. Cockburn! Are we cutting, sir?

172
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:37,515
No! No. I'm not cutting!
We're still rolling!

173
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:38,680
Damien, what's the dealy, dude?

174
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,587
Are we gonna blow
this tree line or what?

175
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:42,250
Tuk Tuk and Kim
got the blue balls here.

176
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,588
I'm gonna let them squirt if we're a go!

177
00:12:43,695 --> 00:12:45,925
- Play it through. Still rolling!
- Dieter, can he hear me?

178
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,591
That's C-4, dipshit. Put that back.
I said a detonator.

179
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,066
I need some dudes up here
who speak American, God damn it!

180
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:52,636
He's making
a fucking sweater back here.

181
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:55,069
I'm trying to put Tiger Balm
on this jungle's nuts.

182
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:56,333
Everyone, please shut up.

183
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:58,602
The jets are coming in.
We only have one chance at this!

184
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,109
And go!

185
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:02,509
Let's do it. You feel it?
You feel me?

186
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:05,881
- You are my...
- I am your brother.

187
00:13:06,351 --> 00:13:08,216
We've seen it all, man.

188
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:09,943
I'm sorry, Damien?

189
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,352
Are you seeing that?

190
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:13,481
The little froggy on the boom mike?
It's right in my eyeline.

191
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,455
Donny! What's up, man?

192
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:19,096
It's been there the whole show.

193
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,254
Yeah, well it's right in my face,

194
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:21,354
I'm staring at a frog, I'm trying to feel...

195
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:24,026
It's always the yellow frog that
brings them black frog on Fridays, man.

196
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:25,830
Hell, no, I didn't pee on that girl.

197
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:28,030
No, I didn't pee on her,
listen, listen, listen, listen. No, no.

198
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:30,664
The story is this. She was in the way
when I was peeing, she walked past.

199
00:13:30,775 --> 00:13:33,141
What the fuck is going on here?

200
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:35,405
On three, baby. One, two, breathe.

201
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:38,038
Look, do me a favor. I don't want to do
a countdown before I do the scene.

202
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:39,207
- No countdown?
- No countdown.

203
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:40,511
- Okay.
- Can we just do it off of "Action"?

204
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,177
Just... In your own time.

205
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:44,084
- Good...
- I'm not a rocket ship, okay?

206
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:45,816
- All right, dude.
- And action!

207
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:48,859
Whatever floats your boat, baby.
Fuck! Don't die!

208
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,394
Erika, get me a VitaminWater!

209
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:52,963
You know what it is, Damien? I'm sorry.

210
00:13:53,064 --> 00:13:57,467
Not to get into his thing, but if
I'm crying, should Osiris be crying, too?

211
00:13:57,569 --> 00:13:59,469
- No, it's everyone cry...
- We cutting or we crying?

212
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:00,902
- No, no, no, we're crying!
- Just call it, man!

213
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,133
- Kirk, you can cry. Tugg, you can cry.
- Thanks!

214
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:04,970
- Everybody cry...
- You know what?

215
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:07,044
- You see how agitated he is now?
- I know.

216
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:09,579
- Let's make lemonade. Let's go to work.
- Okay. Still rolling!

217

218

Dieter, these jets
are about to crest this ridge line.

219
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,054
They got about 200 pounds
of shit your pants.

220
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:18,281
I need to know if we're ready to go.

221
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,257
- You're my... You're my...
- I am your...

222
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:26,819
See, that's what I think it is, Damien.
I think it's the line.

223
00:14:26,931 --> 00:14:27,955
Yeah?

224
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:29,931
I don't know if Four Leaf
would say that... Four Leaf?

225
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,367
Were you crying
when your hands blew up?

226
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,097
No. See, he didn't.
Yeah, I mean, just that's what...

227
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:35,763
So now we in re-writes, right?

228
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:37,000
- Where you going?
- Let's re-write it!

229
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:39,269
Action Jackson can't cry.
That's what's going down.

230
00:14:39,377 --> 00:14:41,345
You know what, Kirk?
I'm ready to do the scene!

231
00:14:41,446 --> 00:14:45,007
What scene? The scene is
about emotionality. Where is it?

232
00:14:45,116 --> 00:14:46,708
- Now it's time to flip the script!
- Kirk...

233
00:14:46,818 --> 00:14:48,979
Be here till Chinese New Year
waiting for my man to cry.

234
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:51,155
You're tangling me,
you're fucking tangling me.

235

You're tangling me, God damn it!

236
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:55,390
- Kirk, no!
- Stop tailgating me, you pasty tea bag!

237
00:14:55,493 --> 00:14:57,290
I'm going potty.
You want to hold my dick?

238
00:14:57,762 --> 00:15:00,526
Shit! What are you fucking both doing,
Good Lord!

239
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,224
We're getting this in a wide shot, right?

240
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:04,858
Of course we're getting it
in a fucking wide.

241
00:15:04,969 --> 00:15:05,993
What, do you think
I'm a dick or something?

242
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:07,696
Get that fucking food...

243

Shit, shit, cocksucker, bollocks.
Tropic tits!

<i>the most expensive</i>

305
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:28,568
<i>- war movie never made?</i>
- Rick Peck.

306
00:18:28,673 --> 00:18:30,163
<i>Wishing Tugg all the best on that one.</i>

307
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:34,609
Rum-Tum-Tuggernauts, it's the Pecker.
You got time for your agent?

308
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:35,974
- Rick?
- Hey, buddy,

309
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,638
guess who I'm staring at right now.

310
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,410
<i>- What?</i>
- I'm looking at your ugly mug

311
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:41,815
on the back cover
of <i>Vanity Fair</i> magazine,

312
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,354
holding a cute, cuddly panda
from Cutesville.

313
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:47,049
It is insane, bro. You are a rock star.

314
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:49,752
Hey, did you get the gift basket I sent?

315
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:50,885
From Rick.

316
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:53,088
Yeah. Yeah. It's cool, man. Thanks.

317
00:18:53,197 --> 00:18:55,757
<i>All right,</i>
<i>that is a real satellite phone, bro.</i>

318
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:57,459
Do not re-gift.

319
00:18:57,568 --> 00:19:00,059
Hey. You see
that <i>Access Hollywood</i> piece?

320
00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:03,106
Yeah, I did.
It was like pistol-whipping a blind kid.

321
00:19:03,207 --> 00:19:07,644
I mean, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,
Tugg. You are a huge star, all right?

322
00:19:07,745 --> 00:19:09,212
But right now,

323
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,872
<i>you're like that kid on the playground,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

324
00:19:10,982 --> 00:19:13,951
the one who has lice that none
of the other kids want to play with?

325
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,043
- What do you mean?
- I mean we gotta shave your head

326
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:18,622
and get you back
on the monkey bars, right?

327
00:19:18,723 --> 00:19:20,054
What?

328
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:22,023
How did the crying scene go?

329
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:23,889
Horrible. Lazarus started crying.

330
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:27,158
<i>Then he starts drooling and dribbling,</i>
<i>and it wasn't even in the script...</i>

331
00:19:27,265 --> 00:19:28,357
Stop right there!

332
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:30,195
<i>You gotta buck up here, Tuggboat.</i>

333
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:32,997
Who cares how much more talented
he may be than you?

334
00:19:33,104 --> 00:19:36,471
If he cries, you cry harder, man.

335
00:19:36,574 --> 00:19:38,735
Didn't your dog have, like, leukemia
or something

336
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:40,208
<i>when you were a kid?</i>
<i>I mean, think of that.</i>

337
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:44,077
Boom! End of story.
They hook up the TiVo yet?

338
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:45,444
Good gosh.

339
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,381
<i>- What?</i>
- The TiVo, they hook it up?

340
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:49,749
<i>- No. The guy didn't come.</i>
- What?

341
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:52,448
For fuck's sake, that is unacceptable.

342
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:54,457
They have digital cable, but,
I mean, it's okay.

343
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,789
No, no, no. Come on, man. It's not okay.

344
00:19:56,894 --> 00:19:59,021
<i>It is not okay, Tugg!</i>

345
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,258
And you don't need to explain to me
why you need TiVo

346
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:06,303
or clean water, clean sheets,
food, shelter.

347
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:09,498
<i>I mean, I fought for that in your contract.</i>

348
00:20:09,607 --> 00:20:11,666
How's the adoption thing coming,
buddy?

349
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:13,801
Not too great.

350
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:19,744
I feel like all the good ones are gone.

351
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,717
Well, at least you get to choose yours.

352
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:25,652
I'm stuck with mine.

353
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:30,083
Tell you what, get back to work,
genius soldier.

354
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:33,061
The Pecker's on a TiVo mission
for the Y-O-U.

355
00:20:33,164 --> 00:20:34,927
<i>Work on those tears, my man.</i>

356
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,125
All right. Yeah.

357
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,792
Say it for me one time.

358
00:20:37,902 --> 00:20:42,168
- You make me happy.
- Make me happy.

359
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:43,865
<i>- I love you, buddy.</i>
- All right, bye.

360
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,767
Crisis meeting?
What does that mean, exactly?

361
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,539
I mean, are we in a crisis?

362
00:20:48,646 --> 00:20:50,170
He's the head of the studio.

363
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:52,647
He's reaching out.
We're 10,000 miles away.

364
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,842
He just wants a little face-time.

365
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:56,545
I know, it's just you said
that he called it a crisis meeting. So...

366
00:20:56,654 --> 00:20:59,054
It's Les Grossman.
He throws these words around.

367
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:03,560
"Crisis," "explosion,"
"not rolling," "fired."

368
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:04,992
These are just words.

369
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:07,189
Yeah! Yeah!

370
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:10,597
Keep a secret? A camera truck
in London just plowed into Judi Dench.

371
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:11,827
Trust me, he's got bigger problems.

372
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:14,404
<i>Look, he may be able to see me,</i>
<i>but I can't see him.</i>

373
00:21:14,505 --> 00:21:19,033
- Move! Move! Hello, Les! Hello!
<i>- Get your ass out of my...</i>

374
00:21:19,143 --> 00:21:20,576
<i>- Your feet were on my desk.</i>
- Can he see us?

375
00:21:20,678 --> 00:21:22,009
I don't know why we don't have...

376
00:21:22,113 --> 00:21:24,274
Get him a Diet Coke. Les! It's working!

377
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:26,873
Yeah, whatever you're doing right there.
Hello, Les!

378
00:21:26,984 --> 00:21:28,383
- Hello, Les!
<i>- Okay.</i>

379
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:30,545
We got you loud and clear here, Les.

380
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:34,352
<i>I see you. I see you. I see you.</i>

381
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,587
<i>Which one of you fuckfaces</i>
<i>is Damien Cockburn?</i>

382
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:40,120
That's me, sir.

383
00:21:40,231 --> 00:21:43,758
It's good to finally meet you at last,
get some face-time.

384
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:47,827
<i>And who here is the key grip?</i>
<i>You? You.</i>

385
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:53,299
<i>Hit that director in the face,</i>
<i>really fucking hard.</i>

386
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:01,515
Sorry, man.

387
00:22:08,025 --> 00:22:10,926
<i>This is your fault, you limey fuck!</i>

388
00:22:11,028 --> 00:22:12,893
<i>You shit the money-bed, my friend.</i>

389
00:22:12,997 --> 00:22:15,522
- What?
- God damn it, Damien!

390
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:18,727
With all due respect, Les Grossman did
not blow up the jungle.

391
00:22:18,836 --> 00:22:19,928
- What?
<i>- Fuck the jungle.</i>

392
00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:21,368
Exactly!

393
00:22:22,073 --> 00:22:23,540
Come on, man.

394
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:27,005
Hey, Les, I understand if you're angry,

395
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:29,102
but I am dealing
with a bunch of prima donnas!

396
00:22:29,213 --> 00:22:32,705
Clowns! Tugg Speedman, he can't cry!
He can't cry!

397
00:22:32,817 --> 00:22:35,217
<i>You know how you handle an actor?</i>
<i>They whine about anything,</i>

398
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:38,618
<i>you pull down their pants</i>
<i>and you spank their ass.</i>

399
00:22:38,723 --> 00:22:40,918
- You spank that ass, Les.
- What?

400
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:44,791
Spanking a child
turns him into a little snot.

401
00:22:45,663 --> 00:22:48,564
Fear makes him a man.

402
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,196
I know a place
where a man's worth is measured

403
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:58,105
in the ears hanging from his dog tags.

404
00:22:58,209 --> 00:23:00,939
The real deep shit.

405
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:02,547
You wanna make this movie right?

406
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,639
You wanna make this movie right?

407
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:07,240
That's where you take
your pansy-ass actors.

408
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:10,684
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

409
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:12,688
Les, that's Four Leaf.

410
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:16,089
Sergeant Four Leaf Tayback.
I wrote the book.

411
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:22,357
<i>You're a great American.</i>
<i>This nation owes you a huge debt.</i>

412
00:23:22,466 --> 00:23:25,435
<i>Now shut the fuck up</i>
<i>and let me do my job!</i>

413
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,771
<i>- Look, Cockburn.</i>
- Yes.

414
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:31,899
<i>From now on, my fist</i>
<i>is gonna be so far up your shithole</i>

415
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:33,374
<i>that every time you have a thought,</i>

416
00:23:33,477 --> 00:23:36,503
<i>it's gonna have to tiptoe</i>
<i>past my wedding ring.</i>

417
00:23:36,614 --> 00:23:40,141
<i>Take control of your actors,</i>
<i>or I will shut you down.</i>

418
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:41,343
<i>Diet Coke!</i>

419
00:23:59,103 --> 00:24:01,298
One week down, two weeks behind,

420
00:24:01,405 --> 00:24:05,205
GI Joe can't cry, don't matter 'cause you
ain't got the camera turned on anyway.

421
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:06,708
Let's party!

422
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:09,545
Man, you better get your shit straight,

423
00:24:09,647 --> 00:24:12,514
or I'll be on the next NetJet out of here,
baby. You feel me?

424
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:14,351
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

425
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,977
Here comes another.
There we go. Now what?

426
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:19,687
- Sandusky. Good.
- Hey, Mr. Cockburn.

427
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,655
We need to have a cast meeting
right now.

428
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,056
- Right now? Awesome.
- Yes.

429
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,354
You actually care, don't you?

430
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:27,056
Yeah, it's a huge deal for me,
are you kidding?

431
00:24:27,164 --> 00:24:29,132
I've spent the past two years of my life

432
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:32,930
living off residuals from a anti-herpes
medication commercial.

433
00:24:33,037 --> 00:24:34,197
I know, you're the only one
who auditioned,

434
00:24:34,305 --> 00:24:35,863
the only one who did
the two-week boot camp.

435
00:24:35,973 --> 00:24:37,634
Hey, hey, Alpa.

436
00:24:38,342 --> 00:24:40,810
I'm the director. He's...
I need to speak to my actor.

437
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:42,139
All right, hold up. Chino?

438
00:24:42,246 --> 00:24:44,009
What? Hell, yo. What's up, baby?

439
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:46,439
This about
the Booty Sweat cross-promotion?

440
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,574
No, it's about the film.

441
00:24:47,685 --> 00:24:49,676
Oh, the film and Booty Sweat's
the same thing. Give him a shot.

442
00:24:50,054 --> 00:24:52,181
Hey, how you doing, Jeff?

443
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,748
- Who are you?
- That's awesome, man.

444
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:02,762
Kevin. Kevin Sandusky. I play Brooklyn,
we've been working together.

445
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:04,459
Oh, right, right. I like you.

446
00:25:04,568 --> 00:25:06,536
Man, it's a real honor to be here...

447
00:25:06,637 --> 00:25:07,934
I can tell it's gonna be
a good experience.

448
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,165
I'm really having a good time.

449
00:25:09,273 --> 00:25:10,900
Hey, can you help me out, man?
I'm looking for this guy.

450
00:25:11,008 --> 00:25:15,172
The grip with the bandana.
He's got a package for me.

451
00:25:15,646 --> 00:25:18,046
There he is, fucker. Dragon!

452
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,981
What the fuck? Oh, buddy!

453
00:25:21,118 --> 00:25:22,483
I'm gonna go shoot a video, right?

454
00:25:22,586 --> 00:25:24,713
I'm gonna have V.C. Soldiers
in the video

455
00:25:24,822 --> 00:25:26,119
doing the noodle-legs, Damien.

456
00:25:26,223 --> 00:25:30,592
Hell, yeah, do it. V.C. Soldiers doing
the hip-hop bunny hop, Damien.

457
00:25:30,828 --> 00:25:32,489
It's good, I love it, great. But I need to...

458
00:25:32,596 --> 00:25:35,588
V.C. Soldiers doing the seizure, baby.
Hit it, baby.

459
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:37,394
Hell yeah, get it. Get it, Cornbread.

460
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,730
Alpa!

461
00:25:40,838 --> 00:25:42,271
Yo, check it out. Donny on the phone.

462
00:25:42,373 --> 00:25:43,340
Hello? Yo, yo, Donny!

463
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,500
Can we call him back?
I've got to have a cast meeting.

464
00:25:49,046 --> 00:25:51,378
<i>When we put aside our differences,</i>

465
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:54,349
<i>we see we're kind of the same.</i>

466
00:25:55,252 --> 00:25:58,779
<i>When we put aside our differences,</i>
<i>we see</i>

467
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,323
<i>we're kind of the same.</i>

468
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:04,891
<i>Let's be friends.</i>

469
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,824
<i>I know we can do great things together.</i>

470
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:13,700
<i>That's a quotation from</i>
<i>a children's book I co-wrote,</i>

471
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,599
The Boy Everybody Was Jealous Of.

472
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:18,436
<i>I think it pertains to the journey...</i>

473
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:19,873
<i>Simple Jack</i> sucked ass!

474
00:26:20,945 --> 00:26:23,345
<i>All right, who said that? It's not funny.</i>

475
00:26:23,447 --> 00:26:25,210
<i>Whoever it is, it's not funny, okay?</i>

476
00:26:32,523 --> 00:26:35,219
When the herd loses its way,

477
00:26:35,326 --> 00:26:39,763
the shepherd must kill
the bull that leads them astray.

478
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,864
- Four Leaf?
- Come on over. It's okay.

479
00:26:46,537 --> 00:26:48,027
- Sit down.
- Yes.

480
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,537
- So, you don't like the hotel?
- Beds give me nightmares.

481
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:04,782
I'm guessing right about now
you couldn't find a Dixie coonskin

482
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:09,223
with an Ohio hooker holding your prick
and showing you the way.

483
00:27:16,033 --> 00:27:17,364
What?

484
00:27:17,601 --> 00:27:19,193
You're a riddle

485
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,639
with no cheese to maze through.

486
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:26,510
Don't you get it?

487
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:30,341
No, I don't. I'm a cock of the mouse
or something. I don't know.

488
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:34,384
I put my story in your limp Brit hands,

489
00:27:34,485 --> 00:27:37,921
and you are not going to fail me.

490
00:27:38,022 --> 00:27:41,617
You think I was just blowing
my own bagpipe in that meeting?

491
00:27:41,725 --> 00:27:45,559
You must put those boys in the shit.

492
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,221
What? I don't understand.

493
00:27:47,331 --> 00:27:50,596
- You wanna make your movie or not?
- Yes, I do.

494
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:54,193
All right, you get
some of those little video type cameras.

495
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:57,934
We take them out there, and we put
them in the trees in different angles.

496
00:27:58,042 --> 00:28:01,375
Then you give me
and that pyromaniac Cody

497
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:06,348
all the smoke bombs, charges,
explosives, detonators you got.

498
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,884
Then we take those boys up there,

499
00:28:08,986 --> 00:28:12,080
me and Cody,
we could light up that fucking jungle,

500
00:28:12,189 --> 00:28:15,124
so those lily-dick actors
would be shitting their pants

501
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,217
and screaming for their mammies.

502
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:20,786
They'd be begging for a body bag
if it means a ride home.

503
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:25,158
I could do it.

504
00:28:25,936 --> 00:28:29,372
I could shoot the whole thing
guerrilla style. Gritty, dirty.

505
00:28:29,473 --> 00:28:32,806
Get them away from their helpers
and ass-licking assistants.

506
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,002
Put them in the real shit.

507
00:28:34,111 --> 00:28:35,305
- Real shit.
- With real fear in their eyes!

508
00:28:35,412 --> 00:28:38,472
Real fear, real emotion!
Yes, Four Leaf, yes!

509
00:28:38,582 --> 00:28:40,675
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

510
00:28:40,784 --> 00:28:42,547
Take them off the fucking grid!

511
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,768
You are no longer actors in a movie!

512
00:29:03,874 --> 00:29:06,604
You are five men in a helicopter!

513
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,142
With three other men!

514
00:29:15,786 --> 00:29:17,310
How long are we gonna be gone,
anyways?

515
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:21,482
'Cause I left most of my vitamins
back at the hotel.

516
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:24,152
- Save your breath, maggots!
- That's right, maggots!

517
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,502
M&M?

518
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,707
M&M?

519
00:30:00,497 --> 00:30:02,633
Go, go, go! Get out of the chopper!

520
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:03,156
Go, go, go! Get out of the chopper!

521
00:30:04,468 --> 00:30:07,631
Move it, maggots, move!
Move, grunts, move your ass!

522
00:30:07,738 --> 00:30:10,036
Get out, you wriggly worms!

523
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,608
- It's up too high!
- Move, move, move!

524
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,809
See you in hell!

525
00:30:29,326 --> 00:30:33,524
This is bullshit!
I gotta at least call my fucking assistant.

526
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:37,528
Fucking! Jesus! Dude!

527
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,233
You're sitting on a nest
of hostile enemy V.C.

528
00:30:41,338 --> 00:30:44,774
Congratulations, Fats.
You just got us all killed.

529
00:30:45,776 --> 00:30:49,371
Anybody else care to give away
our position to Charlie?

530
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,243
Cell phones!

531
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:52,815
What the hell, Damien?

532
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:56,613
Weren't no cell phones in '69, man.
I'm head-to-toe legitimate.

533
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,121
Gentlemen, I've got good news
and bad news.

534
00:31:00,224 --> 00:31:03,716
The studio wants to shut us down.
That's the bad news.

535
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:06,159
And the good news.

536
00:31:06,263 --> 00:31:09,164
If you wanna save this movie,
you will become a unit.

537
00:31:09,266 --> 00:31:13,032
Your objective is to head north
to the D'ang Kwook River

538
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:14,627
and liberate the POW camp,

539
00:31:14,738 --> 00:31:18,003
at which point Four Leaf
will get himself captured,

540
00:31:18,108 --> 00:31:19,905
at which point you will rescue him,

541
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:23,377
at which point
we will chopper you home!

542
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:25,673
Damn.

543
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,580
Four Leaf,
since you're the staff sergeant,

544
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:30,085
there's the map, this is the scene list.

545
00:31:30,187 --> 00:31:32,314
Think you can handle it?

546
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:36,621
We have rigged this entire
valley of death with hidden cameras.

547
00:31:38,095 --> 00:31:41,724
And I will be shooting as well,
from unseen vantage points,

548
00:31:41,832 --> 00:31:45,427
so that every glorious moment
is captured on film.

549
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:49,867
And believe me, gentlemen,
it will be glorious.

550
00:31:49,973 --> 00:31:52,498
If it looks real,
chances are it probably is.

551
00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:54,201
You wanted to be actors.

552
00:31:54,311 --> 00:31:56,905
You wanted to occupy
the skin of another human being.

553
00:31:57,014 --> 00:32:00,006
Well, get ready to occupy the skin
of a terrified U.S. Infantry grunt,

554
00:32:00,117 --> 00:32:03,883
surrounded by death,
crawling up Satan's bottom.

555
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:09,621
There'll be ambushes, enemy fire,
your own little personal slice of 'Nam.

556
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:14,323
This radio goes to the chopper
and the chopper only.

557
00:32:14,431 --> 00:32:18,868
The chopper is God,
and I am Jesus Christ, his son.

558
00:32:18,969 --> 00:32:21,665
You are my chosen disciples.

559
00:32:21,772 --> 00:32:24,798
And no one gets to go home
till we get the shots.

560
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:27,934
Put on your war faces, gentlemen.

561
00:32:28,045 --> 00:32:32,744
Now, let's go and make
the greatest war movie ever!

562
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,182
- Yeah!
- All right!

563
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:54,995
Yeah!

564
00:33:00,444 --> 00:33:01,502
Yeah!

565
00:33:14,057 --> 00:33:15,957
Not bad, Cockburn!

566
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:18,989
Not bad.

567
00:33:20,697 --> 00:33:22,289
Wherever you are!

568
00:33:24,301 --> 00:33:27,361
Wherever he is?
Looks like he's all over the place.

569
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,073
Here we go.

570
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,200
Must be an old French mine.

571
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:36,768
It's a remnant from colonial Indo-China.
This jungle must be full of them.

572
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:42,307
Don't you get it?
He's messing with our heads.

573
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:44,444
That's what all that
playing God stuff was about.

574
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:47,115
He's trying to get us to act good,
save the movie.

575
00:33:47,224 --> 00:33:50,250
He ain't playing God.
He's being judged by him.

576
00:33:54,264 --> 00:33:56,960
That's our objective.
Complete the mission.

577
00:34:03,173 --> 00:34:06,074
No offense, Kirk,
I know you're the big fancy actor here,

578
00:34:06,176 --> 00:34:10,078
but I've done a lot more effects-driven
event films than you. Okay?

579
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,579
And I think I can spot

580
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,208
a prop head when I see one.

581
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:16,809
Oh, Jesus.

582
00:34:18,021 --> 00:34:21,513
It's corn syrup, guys.
Corn syrup and latex.

583
00:34:24,728 --> 00:34:27,856
Warm, blood-flavored corn syrup.

584
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:29,091
Oh, God.

585
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:32,861
Smoke and mirrors, guys.
Welcome to the movie factory.

586
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,164
Oldest trick in the book.

587
00:34:36,173 --> 00:34:37,470
He getting down now.

588
00:34:37,574 --> 00:34:38,939
Oh, my God!

589
00:34:41,745 --> 00:34:43,804
Whoa, look at me!

590
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:45,381
You're going to get the shots,

591
00:34:45,482 --> 00:34:48,474
and I'm going to make sure
because I'm the director.

592
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:50,712
I'm from London. I direct plays.

593
00:34:50,821 --> 00:34:53,847
Hey, Damien! We got our war faces on!

594
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:05,562
Look, I'm Dave Beckham.

595
00:35:15,212 --> 00:35:17,612
So, we gotta
light these boys up today, huh?

596
00:35:17,714 --> 00:35:19,909
Blow some sense into these young men.

597
00:35:20,884 --> 00:35:23,785
Hey, I don't want to come off
as weird or anything,

598
00:35:23,887 --> 00:35:27,823
but I might be your biggest fan. Yeah.

599
00:35:29,192 --> 00:35:32,684
<i>Tropic Thunder.</i>
Kind of like my <i>Catcher in the Rye.</i>

600
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:36,161
Yeah, I've never been in the military,
per se,

601
00:35:36,266 --> 00:35:38,700
but I have lost an appendage
in the line of duty.

602
00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:42,734
<i>Driving Miss Daisy,</i> first studio gig.

603
00:35:43,507 --> 00:35:44,565
Yeah.

604
00:35:45,075 --> 00:35:47,873
It's a pretty cool sidearm you got there.
What is it?

605
00:35:47,978 --> 00:35:49,639
I don't know what it's called.

606
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:55,514
I just know the sound it makes
when it takes a man's life.

607
00:35:58,655 --> 00:35:59,713
Okay.

608
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,518
Damien, we're go for explosion.

609
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:04,423
Ready to kick the tires
and light the fires on your say-so.

610
00:36:04,528 --> 00:36:06,257
Damien, we're go for explosion.

611
00:36:07,397 --> 00:36:08,421
<i>Do you copy?</i>

612
00:36:08,532 --> 00:36:11,399
<i>I got an itchy trigger finger here,</i>
<i>and I'm ready to blow some shit up.</i>

613
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:15,130
All right, you happy now?
Can we do the scene?

614
00:36:15,238 --> 00:36:17,866
Or do you need a formal invitation?
Come on, let's go!

615
00:36:19,676 --> 00:36:20,768
Here. Okay.

616
00:36:20,877 --> 00:36:23,072
"Scene 12, exterior,
jungle clearing, day, ambush.

617
00:36:28,618 --> 00:36:30,552
"Four Leaf notices
movement in the brush.

618
00:36:30,654 --> 00:36:33,680
"A dozen guerrilla fighters
can be seen moving in the tree line.

619
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,350
"Somewhere a mine explodes."
And you.

620
00:36:37,694 --> 00:36:39,719
"I got a bad feeling on this one."

621
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,320
- Yeah.
- No, that's your line.

622
00:36:41,431 --> 00:36:44,298
- I got... Now?
- Yeah, but scared. Like, scared.

623
00:36:44,401 --> 00:36:47,131
- "I got a bad feeling on this one."
- Dude, wait, like how?

624
00:36:47,237 --> 00:36:49,068
"I got a bad feeling on this one."

625
00:36:49,172 --> 00:36:51,265
- Okay.
- Action. Go, come on.

626
00:37:00,283 --> 00:37:03,150
I got a bad feeling
on this one there, Fats.

627
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:07,889
Our asses don't get fragged
in this bullshit valley,

628
00:37:07,991 --> 00:37:09,822
first thing I'm doing
is paying my two bucks

629
00:37:09,926 --> 00:37:11,553
so I can watch Brooklyn bust his cherry

630
00:37:11,661 --> 00:37:14,357
on a sweet little mama-san's
dinky dau poontang.

631
00:37:14,464 --> 00:37:17,365
Shit, Brooklyn be bagged and tagged
before he get any cooch.

632
00:37:17,467 --> 00:37:20,698
He die, he probably die
a coochless motherfucker.

633
00:37:20,804 --> 00:37:22,203
Zip it, Motown.

634
00:37:22,305 --> 00:37:23,863
Don't you worry, Brooklyn.

635
00:37:23,974 --> 00:37:26,033
You got a lot of days of fucking
ahead of you.

636
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:29,737
Man, I'm thirsty.

637
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:35,807
Might as well have some of this
Booty Sweat I got back in Danang.

638
00:37:36,686 --> 00:37:40,178
Yo, asshole! This motherfucker's dead!

639
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,087
Ain't no <i>Criss Angel Mindfreak,</i>

640
00:37:42,192 --> 00:37:45,525
David Blaine trapdoor
horseshit jumping off here!

641
00:37:45,629 --> 00:37:49,395
Hey! You wanna get on the train here,
or do you wanna ruin another take?

642
00:37:49,499 --> 00:37:52,832
There ain't no goddamn takes,
ain't no goddamn motion picture!

643
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,567
- You sure?
- Yeah.

644
00:37:55,672 --> 00:37:57,469
- Yeah?
- For certain, man.

645
00:37:57,574 --> 00:37:59,474
Then why are you still in character?

646
00:38:01,044 --> 00:38:03,012
I know, but I don't have to tell you.

647
00:38:04,147 --> 00:38:05,205
You don't know.

648
00:38:05,315 --> 00:38:08,250
Man, I don't drop character
till I done a DVD commentary.

649
00:38:11,021 --> 00:38:13,182
You happy now?
We're out of position for the effects!

650
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,019
Get down, fool!

651
00:38:16,726 --> 00:38:19,627
Didn't anyone read the script?
This is the ambush!

652
00:38:21,031 --> 00:38:24,694
- This feels pretty real!
- Exactly! Let's use it.

653
00:38:35,312 --> 00:38:36,472
Yeah!

654
00:38:37,747 --> 00:38:39,112
Yeah!

655
00:38:41,718 --> 00:38:42,980
Eat lead!

656
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:47,321
They're busting caps
like a motherfucker down there.

657
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:52,687
This is FUBAR. I say we juice them.

658
00:38:52,796 --> 00:38:54,286
- What do you think?
- Juice them.

659
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,191
Fuck you, Charlie!

660
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:02,738
Big-ass titties!

661
00:39:08,712 --> 00:39:10,339
Look at that, huh?

662
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:16,813
And cut!

663
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:20,920
That's the trailer right there.

664
00:39:21,024 --> 00:39:22,321
Yeah!

665
00:39:22,425 --> 00:39:24,689
- What do we do now?
- Yeah.

666
00:39:24,794 --> 00:39:26,318
North. Man said to head north.

667
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:29,762
- Did you see me shooting?
- That's how we do. Good work, baby.

668
00:39:29,866 --> 00:39:30,924
I believed it.

669
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:32,194
D'ang Kwook River.

670
00:39:32,836 --> 00:39:34,235
I'm betting
he's got more of these battles

671
00:39:34,337 --> 00:39:37,067
and Viet Congs
rigged for us along the way.

672
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:40,940
Sergeant Osiris, get your men.
Load and lock.

673
00:39:41,611 --> 00:39:43,374
Real, baby, I'm real.

674
00:39:44,447 --> 00:39:47,245
Let's go! We got a lot of klicks to cover!

675
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:51,411
Hump it up, gentlemen!
Single formation.

676
00:39:51,521 --> 00:39:53,352
Don't dawdle now!

677
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,746
D-Rod, D-Rod, this is Puddingface.
How are we coming on that hotplate?

678
00:40:24,387 --> 00:40:27,686
Something's up.
I think we better drag ass back there.

679
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:30,487
Make sure Damien ain't forgot
how to use his talkbox again.

680
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:41,204
Yeah, baby, come on. Just a little taste.

681
00:40:42,806 --> 00:40:44,933
- What are you doing, Jeff?
- Fucking... Nothing, man!

682
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:48,374
- I'm eating jellybeans.
- Wow, I love jellybeans. Can I please...

683
00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:51,208
No, you can't have
any fucking jellybeans.

684
00:40:51,314 --> 00:40:52,406
They're mine.

685
00:40:52,515 --> 00:40:53,675
You think
you're the only one who gets sick

686
00:40:53,783 --> 00:40:55,478
when he doesn't have his jellybeans?

687
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:56,984
Boundaries, man. Fuck.

688
00:41:16,906 --> 00:41:19,602
Hey. I didn't mean to
show you up back there.

689
00:41:19,709 --> 00:41:23,839
It's just, I feel like we really need
to set the example for the other guys.

690
00:41:23,947 --> 00:41:25,847
It's gonna be tough,

691
00:41:25,949 --> 00:41:28,975
but I think Damien's gonna get
some great shit out of us.

692
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,249
Just wish I had
a director like this on <i>Jack.</i>

693
00:41:32,355 --> 00:41:34,846
On <i>Jack.</i> What? <i>Jack?</i>
What you talking about?

694
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:38,027
<i>- Simple Jack.</i>
- Oh, yeah.

695
00:41:39,529 --> 00:41:42,760
<i>Simple Jack,</i> yeah.
You went all out on that one, huh?

696
00:41:42,866 --> 00:41:45,130
You did.
Really swung for the fences, huh?

697
00:41:45,235 --> 00:41:47,635
Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.

698
00:41:47,737 --> 00:41:50,638
Yeah, it was an intense experience,
you know.

699
00:41:51,341 --> 00:41:53,434
I just did the work.

700
00:41:53,543 --> 00:41:57,343
Watched a lot of retarded people.
Spent time with them. Observed them.

701
00:41:58,648 --> 00:42:00,809
Watched all the retarded stuff they did.

702
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:02,680
Then again,
I always found mere observation

703
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:05,084
in and of itself is a tad rudimentary.

704
00:42:05,188 --> 00:42:08,248
Sometimes, we gotta dig deeper
to mine the true emotional pay dirt.

705
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:12,692
Thus, we can diagram the source
of the pain and then live it, you know.

706
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:14,855
Yeah, yeah, live it. Yeah, exactly.

707
00:42:14,964 --> 00:42:17,694
You know, there were times
when I was doing <i>Jack</i>

708
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:20,269
that I actually felt retarded,

709
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,735
- like really retarded.
- Oh, yeah.

710
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:24,033
I mean, I brushed my teeth retarded,

711
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,937
- I rode the bus retarded.
- Damn.

712
00:42:26,042 --> 00:42:29,273
In a weird way,
I had to sort of just free myself up

713
00:42:29,379 --> 00:42:32,348
to believe that it was okay
to be stupid or dumb.

714
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,007
- To be a moron.
- Yeah.

715
00:42:34,117 --> 00:42:36,847
- To be moronical.
- Exactly, to be a moron.

716
00:42:36,953 --> 00:42:38,318
- An imbecile.
- Yeah.

717
00:42:38,421 --> 00:42:41,288
Like the dumbest motherfucker
that ever lived.

718
00:42:41,391 --> 00:42:42,551
When I was playing the character.

719
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:45,253
- When you was the character.
- Yeah, as Jack, definitely.

720
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:47,557
Jack, stupid ass Jack.

721
00:42:47,664 --> 00:42:48,926
Trying to come back from that.

722
00:42:49,032 --> 00:42:53,162
In a weird way it was almost like
I had to sort of fool my mind

723
00:42:53,269 --> 00:42:56,238
into believing that it wasn't retarded,

724
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:58,068
and by the end of the whole thing,
I was like,

725
00:42:58,174 --> 00:43:02,702
"Wait a minute, I flushed so much out,
how am I gonna jumpstart it up again?"

726
00:43:02,812 --> 00:43:04,871
- It's just like... Right?
- Yeah.

727
00:43:04,981 --> 00:43:07,745
You was farting in bathtubs
and laughing your ass off.

728
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:09,716
Yeah.

729
00:43:09,819 --> 00:43:12,117
But Simple Jack thought he was smart,

730
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:13,519
or rather, didn't think he was retarded,

731
00:43:13,623 --> 00:43:16,490
so you can't afford to play retarded,
being a smart actor.

732
00:43:16,593 --> 00:43:19,084
Playing a guy who ain't smart
but thinks he is,

733
00:43:19,195 --> 00:43:20,822
- that's tricky.
- Tricky.

734
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:24,457
It's like working with mercury.
It's high science, man. It's an art form.

735
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:26,592
- Yeah.
- You an artist.

736
00:43:26,703 --> 00:43:28,500
- That's what we do, right? Yeah.
- Yeah.

737
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:29,867
Hats off for going there,

738
00:43:29,973 --> 00:43:32,703
especially knowing how
the Academy is about that shit.

739
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:39,940
- About what?
- You're serious? You don't know?

740
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,177
Everybody knows
you never go full retard.

741
00:43:45,722 --> 00:43:47,815
- What do you mean?
- Check it out.

742
00:43:47,957 --> 00:43:52,053
Dustin Hoffman, <i>Rain Man,</i> looked
retarded, act retarded, not retarded.

743
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:56,258
Count toothpicks, cheat at cards.
Autistic, sure. Not retarded.

744
00:43:57,133 --> 00:43:58,998
Then you got Tom Hanks,
<i>Forrest Gump.</i>

745
00:43:59,102 --> 00:44:01,400
Slow, yes, retarded, maybe,
braces on his legs.

746
00:44:01,504 --> 00:44:04,405
But he charmed the pants off Nixon,
and he won a Ping-Pong competition.

747
00:44:04,507 --> 00:44:05,531
That ain't retarded.

748
00:44:05,675 --> 00:44:09,611
And he was a goddamn war hero.
You know any retarded war heroes?

749
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:13,539
You went full retard, man.

750
00:44:15,084 --> 00:44:16,449
Never go full retard.

751
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:21,015
You don't buy that?
Ask Sean Penn, 2001, <i>I Am Sam.</i>

752
00:44:21,124 --> 00:44:24,423
Remember? Went full retard?
Went home empty-handed.

753
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:37,467
Oh, my God! Holy shit!

754
00:44:38,141 --> 00:44:40,837
Good job, turd. You killed the director.

755
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:42,206
No, that's impossible, man.

756
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:45,179
I rigged the whole tree line,
and this is here.

757
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:46,839
- He must have missed his mark.
- Missed his mark?

758
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,178
Yeah, this isn't me.

759
00:44:48,284 --> 00:44:51,082
Come on, let's bag and tag the bastard
and get back to the hotel.

760
00:44:51,187 --> 00:44:53,883
- You're in a world of hurt, dumbo!
- We're in a world of hurt!

761
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:56,185
- You're in trouble.
- This isn't just on me!

762
00:44:56,292 --> 00:44:58,522
- We're in a... We're together on this.
- Bullshit.

763
00:44:58,628 --> 00:45:00,095
You're just gonna run away.
You're gonna leave.

764
00:45:00,196 --> 00:45:01,857
What happened to,
"No man left behind," okay?

765
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:04,229
Just wait, just wait! Listen!
Listen, okay?

766
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:07,064
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Let me just be real with you, all right?

767
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:10,469
I almost blinded Jamie Lee Curtis
on <i>Freaky Friday,</i> okay?

768
00:45:10,573 --> 00:45:11,904
This shit will fucking ruin me!

769
00:45:12,008 --> 00:45:13,908
- Just get off me! You're pathetic.
- No, I'm not.

770
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:16,478
- Get off me!
- You are not going back!

771
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:21,783
- What the fuck?
- Now wait a minute.

772
00:45:32,161 --> 00:45:34,857
So, what?
We're just supposed to keep walking?

773
00:45:34,964 --> 00:45:37,831
Try to stay in character.
Remember, we're on camera.

774
00:45:37,967 --> 00:45:38,934
This thing's too heavy.

775
00:45:39,035 --> 00:45:40,468
I want the rubber one
that the prop guy gave me.

776
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:42,834
Where's the fucking prop guy?

777
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:50,404
How's it going with that map, chief?

778
00:45:50,513 --> 00:45:53,107
- Can I have a look at it?
- I got it.

779
00:45:53,216 --> 00:45:54,774
Yeah, Damien gave it to me,
remember?

780
00:45:54,884 --> 00:45:56,374
Yeah, but he gave it to you for us.

781
00:45:56,486 --> 00:45:58,113
- Yeah.
- Okay.

782
00:45:58,221 --> 00:46:00,746
- I got it.
- You got it upside down.

783
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:01,857
Thank you.

784
00:46:01,991 --> 00:46:03,549
Letters go one way
and the numbers another.

785
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,218
Dude, I'm trying to...
I got your back, man.

786
00:46:05,328 --> 00:46:07,091
- Well, I'm cool. All right, I'm cool.
- You are?

787
00:46:07,196 --> 00:46:09,061
Is your character dyslexic?

788
00:46:09,165 --> 00:46:10,894
- No, my character's not dyslexic.
- So you a cartographer.

789
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,831
I'm tired, I want to go home.

790
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,461
Why, so you can get back and make
<i>Fatties: Fart 20,</i> or some shit?

791
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:18,507
It's <i>Fatties: Fart Two,</i> there's no... Hey,
you wish you had a <i>Fatties</i> franchise.

792
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:19,836
- What?
- It's <i>Fatties: Fart Two.</i>

793
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,171
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't want no <i>Fatties</i> franchise,

794
00:46:21,277 --> 00:46:23,677
- I got a diamond toilet.
- Your stupid-ass commercials.

795
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,247
You're all fucked up, man,
you look tired.

796
00:46:25,348 --> 00:46:26,474
You look like you bumped your head
or something,

797
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,414
so I came over to see
if you're fucking all right, that's all.

798
00:46:28,518 --> 00:46:30,543
- Yeah, why don't you get on point?
- I'm on point right here.

799
00:46:30,653 --> 00:46:31,677
...my farts
are fucking more beautiful than...

800
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:34,348
You still got that shit upside down.

801
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,357
The numbers help, man, the numbers...

802
00:46:36,459 --> 00:46:38,689
The letters go across the top
and then the numbers.

803
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:40,353
- Want the map?
- Yeah, I want the fucking map.

804
00:46:40,463 --> 00:46:41,896
Well, you can't have it,
'cause Damien gave it me.

805
00:46:41,998 --> 00:46:45,161
You wish you had my farts,
my farts are fucking music.

806
00:46:45,268 --> 00:46:47,634
All right. That's enough.

807
00:46:49,105 --> 00:46:52,836
Everybody's obviously a little bushed
from all this humping.

808
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:55,934
So take a chow break. Chow break!

809
00:46:57,747 --> 00:46:59,305
But stay alert.

810
00:46:59,882 --> 00:47:03,374
Remember, Charlie don't care
if you're on break or not.

811
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:11,393
All right, that's lunch. Coming back
to the same scene afterwards,

812
00:47:11,494 --> 00:47:12,859
"Lost in the goddamn jungle."

813
00:47:12,962 --> 00:47:13,929
Captain Simple Jack.

814
00:47:14,931 --> 00:47:15,693
Fuck you.

815
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,399
I fucking hate movies.

816
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:31,578
This is bullshit.
I don't wanna be in this shitty movie.

817
00:47:41,424 --> 00:47:44,188
No! That's my jellybeans! No!

818
00:47:44,293 --> 00:47:48,957
Kid, grab the bat! Please! Shit!

819
00:47:49,065 --> 00:47:52,330
- Yo, man, I got a Bust-A-Nut.
- You go to hell! There he is.

820
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:58,707
God damn it! Okay. Where'd he go?

821
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:01,974
You little piece of shit!
I'm gonna fucking rip your wings off!

822
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,106
Sanducci. Hold up, man,
keep it on the down-low.

823
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:10,748
I don't really gotta piss.
I'm trying to talk at you, man.

824
00:48:10,853 --> 00:48:12,480
Bait, I need bait.

825
00:48:13,623 --> 00:48:17,320
You went to boot camp, right?
You can read a map?

826
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:18,655
Yeah, I think so.

827
00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:21,457
I know Speedman
got everyone convinced we out here

828
00:48:21,564 --> 00:48:25,364
making <i>Planet of the Apes</i> on YouTube
or some shit, but I don't buy it.

829
00:48:25,468 --> 00:48:27,936
You wanna step on a real landmine?
You wanna die?

830
00:48:28,738 --> 00:48:30,433
You wanna get shot
by a real motherfucker?

831
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,703
- Keep looking ahead, man.
- No, of course not.

832
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:36,271
Trying to get home, man.

833
00:48:36,379 --> 00:48:38,040
Got a big job coming up next year.

834
00:48:38,147 --> 00:48:39,580
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

835
00:48:39,682 --> 00:48:42,207
It's about Abe Lincoln and John Wilkes
Booth when they were both young.

836
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:43,410
- Oh, wow!
- Yeah.

837
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:46,010
- That's a classy picture.
- Dude, you kind of look like Abe.

838
00:48:46,122 --> 00:48:47,589
Slap a beard on you.

839
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:49,715
- What's your fucking name?
- Really? It's Kevin.

840
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,817
- Kevin Sandusky.
- Yeah.

841
00:48:52,495 --> 00:48:56,056
If I can put that map in your hands,
can I count on you?

842
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:59,993
- Well, yeah, I guess you can.
- Dynamite. I'm out.

843
00:49:03,673 --> 00:49:06,107
That smelled just like bologna
for some reason.

844
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:08,734
Is anyone gonna fucking help me
get this fucking thing?

845
00:49:09,445 --> 00:49:12,005
Why are they even out in the daytime?

846
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:18,654
I'm gonna level with you, bro.
I don't need to pee. I need to talk to you.

847
00:49:24,894 --> 00:49:28,660
Lazarus is gonna torpedo the movie.

848
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:32,596
He's way out on a limb
with this character,

849
00:49:32,702 --> 00:49:34,533
and I think he's getting cold feet.

850
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:38,636
And the men respect you,
'cause you went to boot camp

851
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:40,368
and rehearsal.

852
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:43,935
- Can I count on you, Kyle.
- It's Kevin.

853
00:49:44,046 --> 00:49:45,104
Good.

854
00:49:46,682 --> 00:49:49,549
If you want
I could give the map a look-see.

855
00:49:49,652 --> 00:49:51,813
- I'll handle the map.
- Okay.

856
00:49:51,921 --> 00:49:55,152
You stick with the program,
we get this movie in the can,

857
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:58,955
I'm thinking there could be
a Teen Choice Award in it for you.

858
00:49:59,061 --> 00:50:03,259
You have that potential.
They'll slime you, the whole deal.

859
00:50:03,366 --> 00:50:06,995
- Yeah, that's wicked.
- Good.

860
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:15,002
There it is! Yeah, now you're dead!

861
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,407
You O.D.'d!

862
00:50:18,981 --> 00:50:20,312
Hold up now, Jeff.

863
00:50:22,718 --> 00:50:24,117
Fucking hell!

864
00:50:25,755 --> 00:50:28,815
What the hell, Jeff? That's a bat, man!

865
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:31,393
I don't have any more jellybeans.

866
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,797
You land there!

867
00:50:54,717 --> 00:50:57,117
Wow. Look at these ruins.

868
00:50:59,288 --> 00:51:03,725
- Where the hell are we?
- D'ang Kwook River.

869
00:51:03,826 --> 00:51:06,192
That so? How do you know that?
How you sure?

870
00:51:06,295 --> 00:51:08,490
Only one way to find out, dude. Let's go.

871
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:13,695
Yeah. I'm not feeling so good right now.
Seriously, my skin hurts!

872
00:51:13,803 --> 00:51:16,237
Enough from the peanut gallery!
Into the water, ladies!

873
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:18,407
No, man. Let me take a look at that map
right quick.

874
00:51:18,574 --> 00:51:20,166
Why is everybody
all obsessed with the map?

875
00:51:20,276 --> 00:51:22,301
'Cause we're tired
of being your trail donkeys!

876
00:51:22,411 --> 00:51:24,811
Acting like you some one-man GPS!

877
00:51:24,914 --> 00:51:28,782
God damn it! We lost!
We fucking super lost, man!

878
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:31,012
Tell him, McClusky.
Tell him what time it is.

879
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,678
I don't believe you people.

880
00:51:34,423 --> 00:51:36,118
What do you mean "you people"?

881
00:51:38,794 --> 00:51:41,388
What do you mean, "you people"?

882
00:51:41,497 --> 00:51:43,488
I think what Tugg means is...

883
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:44,964
No, look at his eyes, man.

884
00:51:45,067 --> 00:51:47,797
...you people, you actors. You people...
- Look at them beady, white devil eyes.

885
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:49,428
I gotta get back to the hotel, for real!

886
00:51:49,538 --> 00:51:51,506
- Hell, no!
- Silence!

887
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:55,203
Chill! All right? Just chill it.

888
00:51:56,712 --> 00:51:59,909
Now, let's go get those Viet Congs.

889
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,308
- "Viet Cong"!
- What?

890
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:05,844
It's "Viet Cong." There's no "S."
It's already plural.

891
00:52:05,955 --> 00:52:07,547
You wouldn't say "Chineses."

892
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:11,359
All right, that's enough
of this insubordination!

893
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:14,258
If the machine breaks down,
we break down.

894
00:52:14,363 --> 00:52:16,888
Hey, man, you know how in <i>Rambo I,</i>
he was big but a little puffy

895
00:52:16,999 --> 00:52:18,591
and then <i>Rambo II,</i>
he got all shredded up?

896
00:52:18,701 --> 00:52:21,568
- Yeah.
- That's kind of how you look right now.

897
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:23,229
- Yeah?
- Not <i>Rambo I but II.</i>

898
00:52:23,339 --> 00:52:25,068
- Really?
- Yeah, when he was cut up.

899
00:52:25,174 --> 00:52:27,540
I'm not that... I mean,
that's what I'm going for, but you know...

900
00:52:27,643 --> 00:52:30,339
Come on, dude. You more shredded
than a julienne salad, man.

901
00:52:30,446 --> 00:52:31,936
- Thanks.
- What's the secret, dude?

902
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:33,413
- It's a diet. I'm just dieting.
- Really?

903
00:52:33,516 --> 00:52:36,508
'Cause I'm trying to come up a little,
but it's just... It's tough.

904
00:52:36,619 --> 00:52:38,109
- You look good.
- Any tips?

905
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,915
- What?
- Any tips, you got?

906
00:52:40,022 --> 00:52:41,148
There's, like, the pineapple...

907
00:52:41,257 --> 00:52:43,555
- Give me that goddamn map! Fuck you!
- Hey!

908
00:52:43,659 --> 00:52:45,251
- Hey!
- All right, now!

909
00:52:45,361 --> 00:52:47,795
What it is, Sikorski?
Tell us where we really at.

910
00:52:47,897 --> 00:52:49,888
That's fucking bullshit!
It's a chump move.

911
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,234
We just getting a second opinion, doc.

912
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,332
We're going the wrong way!

913
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:56,530
- Damn!
- Son of a bitch.

914
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,100
God! I think we were
supposed to be doing this,

915
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:04,112
and instead we did this.

916
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:07,843
Shit, shit, shit, shitty shit, shit!

917
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:10,476
Think you can get us back
to that drop zone, boy?

918
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:12,820
This is not cool!

919
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:16,651
Maybe.

920
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:19,584
This is insane!

921
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,196
Are you really going
to abandon this movie?

922
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,195
We're supposed to be a unit!

923
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:27,827
Suck my unit!

924
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,502
All right, fine.

925
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:35,510
- I'll finish it by myself.
- You go be all you can be, man.

926
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,603
Tugg, you have no idea
where you're going!

927
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,511
Yes, I do!

928
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:44,144
I'm going to, "Exterior, rain forest, dusk.

929
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:48,714
"Smash cut to Four Leaf, who treks
alone through a frightening jungle."

930
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:50,759
Suck on that unit, Kirk!

931
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:07,333
Come on, men. Let's get home.

932
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:50,179
Hello, Mr. Mantis. You're beautiful.

933
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,389
Now, if you recall that whole hullabaloo

934
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,220
where Hollywood
was split into schisms,

935
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:59,727
some studios backing Blu-ray Disc,
others backing HD DVD.

936
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:00,921
People thought it would come down to

937
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:03,294
pixel rate or refresh rate,
and they're pretty much the same.

938
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,200
What it came down to was
a combination of gamers and porn.

939
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:09,032
Now, whichever format porno backs

940
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:12,973
is usually the one
that becomes the most successful.

941
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:16,068
But, you know, Sony,
every PlayStation 3 has a Blu-ray in it.

942
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:17,908
You talking to me this whole time?

943
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,945
I was talking to whoever
was listening to me.

944
00:55:20,049 --> 00:55:21,516
Jesus Christ, man!

945
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,995
Booty Sweat.

946
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:49,443
Oh, God!

947
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:56,243
It's cold! It's freezing. I'm fucking cold.

948
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:58,547
You want my flak jacket?

949
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:02,523
What, are you insane? It's boiling!
It's like a sweat lodge out here!

950
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:05,458
Keep the volume down on that bitching,
Flatch Adams.

951
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:07,462
I gotta take a fucking 12-pound shit!

952
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:09,532
- How we doing? We making good time?
- We're making good time,

953
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:12,760
but there's no way we make it
over that ridge before sundown.

954
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,360
All right, fellas,
we're gonna make camp, rest up!

955
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:17,770
- Oh, God.
- Y'all might be in for a treat.

956
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,273
You know,
back before the war broked out,

957
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:22,105
I was a saucier in San Antone.

958
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,840
I bet I could collar up
some of them greens.

959
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:29,248
Yeah, noodle some crawfish
out the paddy, yo.

960
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:33,379
And maybe some crab apples
for dessert, now, you hear? Hell, yeah!

961
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:35,986
Hell, yeah!

962
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:40,290
That's how we all talk.
We all talk like this, suh! Yes, suh.

963
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:45,629
Yeah, get some crawfish and some ribs.

964
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:50,604
You're Australian! Be Australian!
Excuse me, Kangaroo Jack.

965
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:57,244
I get excited about my foods, man.

966
00:58:22,865 --> 00:58:25,299
Die!

967
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:41,308
No!

968
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:52,157
Dude, dude, what the hell
is going on here? Where are we?

969
00:58:52,261 --> 00:58:54,661
I have no idea.

970
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:57,324
I've never been outside the States.

971
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:59,594
Wait, what?
Are you fucking kidding me?

972
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,693
Did you make this
whole goddamn thing up?

973
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:03,169
Dude, were you
even in the fucking service?

974
00:59:03,272 --> 00:59:05,934
Yes. Of course. Coast Guard.

975
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,942
- Coast Guard.
- Sanitation Department.

976
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,740
Oh, my God!
You're a fucking garbage man!

977
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:14,578
Damn it. F.L. Tayback lies to me
and the whole goddamn U.S. Of A.

978
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:17,346
I wrote the book as a tribute!
I'm a patriot!

979
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:19,512
Yeah, you're the Milli Vanilli
of patriots, okay?

980
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:21,317
You lied
about fighting the Vietnam War.

981
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:24,689
It's like punching the American flag
in the face, God damn it.

982
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:26,227
God, and to think I believed in you!

983
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:28,695
- I don't wanna be next to you.
- Writers lie all the time.

984
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:30,925
Can I be tied to another post? Okay.

985
00:59:52,243 --> 00:59:54,074
<i>- Rick?</i>
- Tugg.

986
00:59:54,178 --> 00:59:56,237
I killed one, Rick.

987
00:59:57,381 --> 00:59:59,781
The thing I love most in the world.

988
00:59:59,883 --> 01:00:01,714
Vivica, get off the line now!

989
01:00:04,021 --> 01:00:06,421
A hooker. All right, you killed a hooker.

990
01:00:06,523 --> 01:00:08,582
Calm down.
Here's what you're gonna do.

991
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:09,852
Get your hands on some bleach,

992
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,326
some hydrogen peroxide
and a shitload of lime.

993
01:00:12,429 --> 01:00:13,919
No, a panda.

994
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:15,794
<i>I killed a panda.</i>

995
01:00:15,899 --> 01:00:17,696
Amanda? Come on, dude.

996
01:00:17,801 --> 01:00:19,826
I mean,
that's probably not even her real name.

997
01:00:19,937 --> 01:00:21,598
No, a panda!

998
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:23,070
A panda?

999
01:00:23,173 --> 01:00:25,767
A sweet, cuddly,

1000
01:00:25,876 --> 01:00:27,810
<i>vicious little panda.</i>

1001
01:00:27,945 --> 01:00:30,880
Jesus Christ, Tugg!
Man, don't scare me like that!

1002
01:00:30,981 --> 01:00:32,141
It's beautiful here.

1003
01:00:32,249 --> 01:00:33,739
<i>You on the set?</i>

1004
01:00:33,851 --> 01:00:35,113
I am the set.

1005
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:38,188
All right, man.
Hey, how's the TiVo working out?

1006
01:00:38,289 --> 01:00:39,517
Screw TiVo.

1007
01:00:39,623 --> 01:00:42,091
I'm way beyond TiVo.

1008
01:00:42,192 --> 01:00:44,285
Last I checked,
they hadn't hooked it up, though.

1009
01:00:44,395 --> 01:00:47,694
Hadn't hooked it up? No TiVo?

1010
01:00:47,798 --> 01:00:49,629
It doesn't matter anymore.

1011
01:00:52,469 --> 01:00:53,936
I've moved on.

1012
01:00:54,672 --> 01:00:56,401
Where have you moved on to?

1013
01:00:56,507 --> 01:00:57,997
<i>Another agency?</i>

1014
01:00:59,543 --> 01:01:01,067
Who's with you?

1015
01:01:01,178 --> 01:01:03,339
It's Nick Stevens, isn't it?
That little fucker.

1016
01:01:03,447 --> 01:01:07,543
<i>You are still my client, Tugg Speedman!</i>
<i>I am getting the TiVo!</i>

1017
01:01:07,651 --> 01:01:09,846
Jacket's on, I'm out the door!

1018
01:01:09,953 --> 01:01:11,011
<i>Tugg?</i>

1019
01:01:14,325 --> 01:01:15,622
Please don't fire me.

1020
01:01:16,493 --> 01:01:17,687
I did it, I did it!

1021
01:01:17,795 --> 01:01:20,127
Vivica, what do I have scheduled
this afternoon?

1022
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:23,097
<i>- Two and a Half Men</i> taping.
- Shit.

1023
01:01:24,101 --> 01:01:25,125
Cancel it.

1024
01:01:25,235 --> 01:01:26,896
And get me Tugg's <i>Tropic Thunder</i>
contract.

1025
01:01:27,004 --> 01:01:30,132
I'm going to Grossman's office,
I'm playing the card.

1026
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,207
Okay.

1027
01:01:34,812 --> 01:01:37,713
Oh, mama. Thirsty.

1028
01:01:37,848 --> 01:01:39,907
He doesn't look too good.

1029
01:01:40,017 --> 01:01:45,045
Must drink,
so I can throw something up!

1030
01:01:45,155 --> 01:01:47,282
No, no. Don't drink that water!
That water's like a petri dish!

1031
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:48,483
No, don't!

1032
01:01:48,592 --> 01:01:51,117
Alpa, do you have any Booty Sweat?

1033
01:01:51,228 --> 01:01:53,594
Yeah, get him chugging on
some of Alpa's ass water.

1034
01:01:53,697 --> 01:01:55,631
That'll bring him around. It's a cure-all.

1035
01:01:55,733 --> 01:01:57,633
Man, what you coming out
in movies for anyway?

1036
01:01:57,735 --> 01:01:59,396
Did you need another revenue stream?

1037
01:01:59,503 --> 01:02:02,301
For your information,
my revenue stream

1038
01:02:02,406 --> 01:02:04,738
currently generates $2 million a year

1039
01:02:04,842 --> 01:02:06,776
in charitable contributions
for my community.

1040
01:02:06,877 --> 01:02:09,209
- Hot damn.
- And why am I in this movie?

1041
01:02:09,313 --> 01:02:11,645
Maybe I just knew I had to represent,

1042
01:02:11,749 --> 01:02:13,546
because they had one good part
in it for a black man

1043
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:15,709
and they gave it to Crocodile Dundee.

1044
01:02:17,321 --> 01:02:20,882
Pump your brakes, kid.
That man is a national treasure.

1045
01:02:20,991 --> 01:02:23,118
I just wanted to throw another shrimp
on your barbie.

1046
01:02:23,227 --> 01:02:24,353
That shit ain't funny.

1047
01:02:24,461 --> 01:02:27,157
Hey, fellas! It's hot!
We're tired! It stinks!

1048
01:02:27,264 --> 01:02:28,822
I'm just fucking with you,
Kangaroo Jack!

1049
01:02:28,932 --> 01:02:30,661
I'm sorry a dingo ate your baby.

1050
01:02:30,768 --> 01:02:33,236
You know that's a true story?
Lady lost her kid.

1051
01:02:33,337 --> 01:02:35,999
- You about to cross some fucking lines.
- Guys, relax and stuff.

1052
01:02:36,106 --> 01:02:37,164
You know what? Fuck that, man!

1053
01:02:37,274 --> 01:02:39,936
I'm sick of this koala-hugging nigger
telling me...

1054
01:02:44,681 --> 01:02:46,239
For 400 years,

1055
01:02:47,284 --> 01:02:50,185
that word has kept us down.

1056
01:02:51,255 --> 01:02:52,882
What the fuck?

1057
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:56,756
It took a whole lot of trying
just to get up that hill.

1058
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:59,761
Now we up in the big leagues,

1059
01:02:59,863 --> 01:03:01,626
getting our turn at bat.

1060
01:03:01,732 --> 01:03:04,394
Long as we live, it's you and me, baby.

1061
01:03:05,068 --> 01:03:08,401
That's the theme song for
<i>The Jeffersons.</i> You really need help.

1062
01:03:08,505 --> 01:03:11,633
Yeah. Just 'cause it's the theme song,
don't make it not true.

1063
01:03:11,742 --> 01:03:13,676
You know what?
I'm gonna tell you what's true.

1064
01:03:13,777 --> 01:03:17,213
I'm gonna tag you back.
You better believe that, baby.

1065
01:03:17,314 --> 01:03:19,908
Guys! Hey, guys!

1066
01:03:20,517 --> 01:03:22,985
Jeff, stay away from that animal.

1067
01:03:25,355 --> 01:03:28,188
I'm gonna bite his hide. I need...

1068
01:03:29,226 --> 01:03:32,491
I need to wear his stomach skin
like a unitard.

1069
01:03:33,464 --> 01:03:36,763
Ain't nobody doing nothing
to no one or body!

1070
01:03:36,867 --> 01:03:41,736
Now, if Mr. Portnoy is feeling
a little flu-ish, don't wanna walk,

1071
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:43,898
put him up on that cloven-hoof animal!

1072
01:03:45,275 --> 01:03:46,572
We got ground to cover!

1073
01:04:15,572 --> 01:04:18,837
All right, POW camp, scene 67.

1074
01:04:19,743 --> 01:04:21,472
Bring it on, Cockburn!

1075
01:04:29,553 --> 01:04:31,987
Maybe he's not, you know,
Ridley Scott or something,

1076
01:04:32,089 --> 01:04:33,886
but I think Renny Harlin's
a tremendous filmmaker

1077
01:04:33,991 --> 01:04:36,789
like, <i>Adventures of Ford Fairlane,</i>
you know,

1078
01:04:36,894 --> 01:04:40,523
as far as an Andrew Dice Clay
vehicle goes, it's pretty decent.

1079
01:04:40,631 --> 01:04:43,065
And <i>Cliffhanger.</i>
<i>Cliffhanger's</i> incredible.

1080
01:04:43,166 --> 01:04:46,624
As far as the whole like,
man against nature type of movies go,

1081
01:04:46,737 --> 01:04:48,898
it's absolutely amazing.

1082
01:04:49,006 --> 01:04:50,906
Shut the fuck up!

1083
01:04:55,546 --> 01:04:57,207
Who send you here?

1084
01:04:57,314 --> 01:05:01,944
Tayback, John, Sergeant,
United States Army.

1085
01:05:02,686 --> 01:05:08,090
Serial number 694529987.

1086
01:05:11,895 --> 01:05:14,887
Perhaps some hot tea
will make conversing

1087
01:05:14,998 --> 01:05:16,761
a little easier.

1088
01:05:20,537 --> 01:05:22,630
My leader's not quite as cordial.

1089
01:05:26,109 --> 01:05:28,976
Look, what? I just thought you might
like some hot tea

1090
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:32,606
- in order to calm your nerves.
- Tayback, John, Sergeant,

1091
01:05:32,749 --> 01:05:37,709
United States Army, 694529987.

1092
01:05:38,555 --> 01:05:44,084
And here's a little message
from my Uncle Sam.

1093
01:05:49,733 --> 01:05:52,099
Dude, you all right?

1094
01:05:52,202 --> 01:05:53,635
Man you totally leaned into that.

1095
01:05:53,737 --> 01:05:56,797
I was pulling it back
and you just came in too...

1096
01:05:56,907 --> 01:05:59,102
Hey, it was an accident, man.

1097
01:06:01,645 --> 01:06:03,579
Come on, good.
You want to keep going?

1098
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,272
- Let's go.
- Get up.

1099
01:06:05,382 --> 01:06:06,974
I rather rot in your V.C. Jail!

1100
01:06:07,084 --> 01:06:10,952
I'll never bend to your will!
You scum! You scum!

1101
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:13,079
Now say this
and go to the beginning again,

1102
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:14,953
let's do the tea part, okay?

1103
01:06:16,493 --> 01:06:17,926
Dude, I hope you're not pissed.

1104
01:06:18,261 --> 01:06:20,058
I see moss on both sides of that tree.

1105
01:06:20,163 --> 01:06:23,291
Well, you know, maybe if I wasn't
the only one at boot camp...

1106
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,300
My belly really hurts, you guys!

1107
01:06:25,402 --> 01:06:27,597
I'm not joking around, I'm nauseous.

1108
01:06:27,704 --> 01:06:29,934
Let me off, I gotta puke!
I don't wanna die like Hendrix!

1109
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,701
All right. All right.

1110
01:06:36,279 --> 01:06:38,270
Are you okay, Jeff?

1111
01:06:38,382 --> 01:06:39,747
I'm awesome.

1112
01:06:42,152 --> 01:06:43,619
Holy shit!

1113
01:06:48,158 --> 01:06:50,319
Okay. Everyone, down, down, down.

1114
01:06:55,032 --> 01:06:56,522
Man. Now I'm tripping.

1115
01:06:56,633 --> 01:06:59,261
That looks like the POW camp
from out the script, yo.

1116
01:07:00,137 --> 01:07:01,832
Speedman was right?

1117
01:07:01,938 --> 01:07:03,303
I don't think so.

1118
01:07:03,407 --> 01:07:05,637
Look at the cooking vats,
the armed guards.

1119
01:07:07,244 --> 01:07:09,337
Looks like a heroin processing plant.

1120
01:07:10,447 --> 01:07:11,573
We were in that chopper for hours.

1121
01:07:11,682 --> 01:07:13,946
I don't even think
we're in Vietnam anymore.

1122
01:07:14,051 --> 01:07:16,485
- Fuck.
- Shit. We ain't even in 'Nam?

1123
01:07:16,586 --> 01:07:19,350
No, most likely Myanmar or Laos.

1124
01:07:19,456 --> 01:07:21,014
What the fuck is Laos?

1125
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:22,284
It's the Golden Triangle.

1126
01:07:22,392 --> 01:07:24,360
Oh, fuck. We're dead.

1127
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:26,429
No one gets out of here. I saw it on TV.

1128
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:30,557
Fucking boats, airplanes,
UFOs and shit, they all just vanish!

1129
01:07:30,667 --> 01:07:33,192
Yo, that's the Bermuda Triangle,
dumbass.

1130
01:07:33,303 --> 01:07:35,669
This is the Golden Triangle.

1131
01:07:35,772 --> 01:07:37,330
It's the world's hard drug superhighway.

1132
01:07:37,441 --> 01:07:38,738
How do you know that?

1133
01:07:38,842 --> 01:07:41,572
It was a really long trip.
I read the in-flight magazine.

1134
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:44,677
Cut!

1135
01:07:44,781 --> 01:07:46,248
Oh, Jesus!

1136
01:07:46,349 --> 01:07:48,840
What do you see, man? I'm blocked.

1137
01:07:48,952 --> 01:07:50,317
Damien, cut!

1138
01:07:52,089 --> 01:07:53,681
Hey, Damien, cut!

1139
01:07:54,524 --> 01:07:56,185
They got Speedman.

1140
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,193
And it doesn't look good.

1141
01:08:30,861 --> 01:08:32,158
I am Tran.

1142
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:35,291
You are a trespasser in my poppy fields.

1143
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:39,328
You are D.E.A. Scum!

1144
01:08:41,271 --> 01:08:44,707
Were there some re-writes
that I missed?

1145
01:08:51,014 --> 01:08:52,504
Do you want to die?

1146
01:08:53,283 --> 01:08:54,750
- Do you?
- No!

1147
01:08:54,851 --> 01:08:58,981
Please, don't hurt me!

1148
01:09:06,863 --> 01:09:08,057
Say that again.

1149
01:09:09,065 --> 01:09:10,862
Please, don't hurt me.

1150
01:09:10,967 --> 01:09:14,061
No! Like you did before! Say it!

1151
01:09:15,038 --> 01:09:16,027
Say it!

1152
01:09:16,139 --> 01:09:20,132
Please, don't hurt me!

1153
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:38,353
- What?
- You are Simple Jack.

1154
01:09:41,331 --> 01:09:43,196
You saw <i>Simple Jack?</i>

1155
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,632
We love the tale of this man,
Simple Jack.

1156
01:09:47,337 --> 01:09:49,168
We do not have many luxury here.

1157
01:09:49,272 --> 01:09:51,706
And <i>Simple Jack</i> is the only movie
we possess.

1158
01:09:51,808 --> 01:09:55,642
You got the VHS.

1159
01:09:55,745 --> 01:09:57,804
We've watched it many, many times.

1160
01:09:57,914 --> 01:10:00,382
You should've got Oscar.

1161
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:05,183
Well, you know. It's...

1162
01:10:06,456 --> 01:10:07,718
Just to be nominated...

1163
01:10:07,824 --> 01:10:09,052
You were nominated?

1164
01:10:09,159 --> 01:10:10,683
No, no, no. I wasn't nominated.

1165
01:10:10,794 --> 01:10:13,957
I'm just saying that to have been
nominated would have been nice.

1166
01:10:14,064 --> 01:10:16,430
It's just... It's very political.
You have to take out ads...

1167
01:10:16,533 --> 01:10:19,024
- Shut up now!
- Okay. Okay.

1168
01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:21,599
So, are you going to

1169
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:24,867
let me go, or...

1170
01:10:24,975 --> 01:10:27,102
No. We'll hold you for ransom.

1171
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:29,007
Much more money now!

1172
01:10:40,590 --> 01:10:41,579
He's in a meeting.

1173
01:10:41,691 --> 01:10:44,455
Yeah, I know.
In about two seconds with the Pecker.

1174
01:10:45,495 --> 01:10:47,360
I'm gonna rip your fucking tits off.

1175
01:10:47,464 --> 01:10:50,126
You wanna talk about trouble?
That's trouble.

1176
01:10:50,233 --> 01:10:51,791
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1177
01:10:53,703 --> 01:10:55,603
What do you need, Peck?

1178
01:10:55,705 --> 01:10:58,333
No, more like what do you need, Les?

1179
01:10:58,441 --> 01:10:59,635
Glasses?

1180
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:01,768
What?

1181
01:11:01,878 --> 01:11:04,369
So you can read
the <i>Tropic Thunder</i> contract

1182
01:11:04,481 --> 01:11:06,881
that guarantees my client,
Tugg Speedman,

1183
01:11:06,983 --> 01:11:10,714
some form of digital video recorder
on location.

1184
01:11:11,488 --> 01:11:13,615
- Huh?
- I can't believe you let him in.

1185
01:11:15,258 --> 01:11:18,091
Look, fuckstick, I'm incredibly busy,
so why don't you get the hell out of here

1186
01:11:18,194 --> 01:11:21,254
before I snap your dick off
and jam it into your ass?

1187
01:11:21,364 --> 01:11:23,389
No, not you, Helen.

1188
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:27,197
But I will rip your tits off
if you don't get me those theaters.

1189
01:11:27,304 --> 01:11:28,828
Perfect.

1190
01:11:28,939 --> 01:11:31,373
Hey, Tuggernuts,
I've got you on speakerphone.

1191
01:11:31,474 --> 01:11:33,339
I'm standing here with Les Grossman,

1192
01:11:33,443 --> 01:11:36,606
and he is dying to tell you
why he's apparently wiped his ass

1193
01:11:36,713 --> 01:11:39,011
with the TiVo clause from your contract.

1194
01:11:40,216 --> 01:11:42,207
We are Flaming Dragon.

1195
01:11:42,319 --> 01:11:44,685
Speedman is with us now.

1196
01:11:44,788 --> 01:11:48,349
<i>For 50 million, you will get him back.</i>

1197
01:11:48,458 --> 01:11:50,619
- Are you gonna get those...
- Who is this?

1198
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:53,423
- And how did you get this phone?
- We are Flaming Dragon!

1199
01:11:53,530 --> 01:11:55,430
Simple Jack belong to us now.

1200
01:11:58,168 --> 01:12:00,193
He does, does he?

1201
01:12:00,303 --> 01:12:02,771
Let me tell you something, shitbird.

1202
01:12:02,872 --> 01:12:05,306
I've never even heard
of your little agency.

1203
01:12:05,408 --> 01:12:07,376
But if you think
you can poach my client...

1204
01:12:07,477 --> 01:12:12,005
Send $50 million, or you no see
Simple Jack again because we kill him.

1205
01:12:12,115 --> 01:12:13,605
This is Les Grossman. Who is this?

1206
01:12:13,717 --> 01:12:16,015
This is Flaming Dragon!

1207
01:12:16,119 --> 01:12:18,883
Okay. Flaming Dragon. Fuckface.

1208
01:12:18,989 --> 01:12:23,824
First, take a big step back
and literally fuck your own face!

1209
01:12:25,195 --> 01:12:27,925
Now, I don't know what kind of
pan-Pacific bullshit power play

1210
01:12:28,031 --> 01:12:30,499
you're trying to pull here,
but Asia, Jack, is my territory.

1211
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:31,897
<i>So whatever you're thinking,</i>
<i>you better think again.</i>

1212
01:12:32,002 --> 01:12:33,367
<i>Otherwise, I'm gonna</i>
<i>have to head down there,</i>

1213
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:36,837
and I will rain down an ungodly
fucking firestorm upon you.

1214
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:38,567
You're gonna have to call
the fucking United Nations

1215
01:12:38,675 --> 01:12:42,702
and get a fucking binding resolution
to keep me from fucking destroying you.

1216
01:12:42,812 --> 01:12:45,406
I am talking scorched earth,
motherfucker!

1217
01:12:45,515 --> 01:12:47,278
I will massacre you!

1218
01:12:47,384 --> 01:12:49,318
I will fuck you up!

1219
01:12:57,127 --> 01:12:58,856
- Could you find out who that was? Go.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1220
01:13:34,297 --> 01:13:37,289
You wear these.
More like Simple Jack teeth.

1221
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,129
Okay.

1222
01:13:39,235 --> 01:13:41,897
Hey. Look, I know you're a big fan,
and that's great...

1223
01:13:44,974 --> 01:13:46,601
Put teeth in!

1224
01:13:53,716 --> 01:13:55,581
Now do movie.

1225
01:13:55,685 --> 01:13:57,346
The whole movie?

1226
01:13:57,454 --> 01:13:59,115
I can't. I don't know the whole...

1227
01:13:59,222 --> 01:14:01,713
You perform! You perform or die!

1228
01:14:02,459 --> 01:14:03,949
Monkey swine!

1229
01:14:06,863 --> 01:14:08,262
Pa.

1230
01:14:10,233 --> 01:14:11,598
More stupid!

1231
01:14:13,369 --> 01:14:18,432
Pa, why you gotta make me feel bad?

1232
01:14:20,877 --> 01:14:22,208
You saw what I saw.

1233
01:14:22,312 --> 01:14:24,906
Tugg Speedman is dead meat
if we don't do something soon.

1234
01:14:25,014 --> 01:14:27,380
Yeah. We could do something
by getting our asses back to the hotel,

1235
01:14:27,484 --> 01:14:28,815
which is in the other direction!

1236
01:14:28,918 --> 01:14:30,510
Ain't right.

1237
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:32,645
What would've happened
in <i>The Great Escape</i>

1238
01:14:32,755 --> 01:14:36,589
if Steve McQueen and them dudes
had turned tail and ran?

1239
01:14:36,693 --> 01:14:40,686
Well, that's what that movie was about.
They were escaping. They ran away.

1240
01:14:40,797 --> 01:14:43,425
I'm trying to agree with you.
The point is they did something.

1241
01:14:43,533 --> 01:14:44,727
Then what are we supposed to do, huh?

1242
01:14:44,834 --> 01:14:48,736
'Cause he's cleaning a gun
with no bullets. Yeah, that's a plan.

1243
01:14:48,838 --> 01:14:52,968
I'm just like a little boy,
playing with his dick when he's nervous.

1244
01:14:56,179 --> 01:14:58,670
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1245
01:14:58,781 --> 01:15:01,841
I got an idea.
This might be a little crazy.

1246
01:15:01,951 --> 01:15:03,919
Crazy's better than nothing.

1247
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:07,979
Back in '98, I did a low-budget
titty comedy for Skinemax.

1248
01:15:08,091 --> 01:15:11,424
<i>- Sex Camp.</i> Remember it?
- Yeah.

1249
01:15:11,528 --> 01:15:15,487
Anyway, me and the campers
from the uncool camp

1250
01:15:15,598 --> 01:15:18,123
had to break into the rich girl camp.

1251
01:15:18,234 --> 01:15:19,929
So, what we did,

1252
01:15:20,036 --> 01:15:23,028
we built a catapult
out of logs and underwear,

1253
01:15:23,139 --> 01:15:26,700
and they shot us over the wall,
and we parachuted down.

1254
01:15:32,315 --> 01:15:33,680
Look,

1255
01:15:33,783 --> 01:15:35,842
you guys, we already know the plan.

1256
01:15:35,952 --> 01:15:37,920
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm giving you gold.

1257
01:15:38,021 --> 01:15:42,390
We do it just like in the book,
Chapter 26, the Wet Offensive.

1258
01:15:42,492 --> 01:15:44,892
The book of <i>Tropic Thunder.</i>

1259
01:15:44,994 --> 01:15:47,224
Yeah, did you guys read the book?

1260
01:15:48,531 --> 01:15:51,159
The flap, I read the back flap
and saw the pictures.

1261
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:55,063
Well, it's okay.
It's exactly the same as in the script.

1262
01:15:55,171 --> 01:15:56,229
Cool.

1263
01:15:58,208 --> 01:16:00,768
You guys all read the script, right?

1264
01:16:00,877 --> 01:16:02,970
I don't read the script, script reads me.

1265
01:16:04,147 --> 01:16:05,614
What the hell does that even mean?

1266
01:16:05,715 --> 01:16:09,082
What you getting at with the books,
scripts? Spit that shit out, man!

1267
01:16:12,422 --> 01:16:14,253
All right. The Wet Offensive.

1268
01:16:15,291 --> 01:16:17,727
Osiris and Fats go undercover
as a diversion.

1269
01:16:17,727 --> 01:16:18,193
Osiris and Fats go undercover
as a diversion.

1270
01:16:18,294 --> 01:16:20,626
Motown and Brooklyn sneak in
via the river.

1271
01:16:20,730 --> 01:16:23,130
Yeah. But those dudes
was trained soldiers.

1272
01:16:25,001 --> 01:16:26,059
Yeah!

1273
01:16:27,136 --> 01:16:30,128
And we trained actors, motherfucker.

1274
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:34,574
Time to man up.
And I ain't gonna sugarcoat.

1275
01:16:34,677 --> 01:16:37,441
Some of us
might not even make it back.

1276
01:16:37,547 --> 01:16:40,641
What do you mean?
Like not on the same flight?

1277
01:16:43,353 --> 01:16:46,117
Alpa and I's already wearing
earth mama's natural night camo.

1278
01:16:46,222 --> 01:16:48,053
- Cool it, Benson.
- Sorry.

1279
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:53,653
We gonna scout, get a plan together.
We ain't back in 20, come looking.

1280
01:16:55,164 --> 01:16:57,029
<i>We are Flaming Dragon.</i>

1281
01:17:00,770 --> 01:17:01,964
Okay.

1282
01:17:03,273 --> 01:17:06,367
Flaming Dragon's
a heroin manufacturer.

1283
01:17:06,476 --> 01:17:09,570
They're responsible
for an eighth of the drug trade in Asia.

1284
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:12,910
- Huge profit margin.
- Guys!

1285
01:17:13,016 --> 01:17:15,951
Would somebody please let me know
what the game plan is?

1286
01:17:16,052 --> 01:17:17,781
Peck! We have it handled.

1287
01:17:17,887 --> 01:17:20,378
Please, don't interrupt.
Everything's under control.

1288
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:22,481
I got it. Got it.

1289
01:17:34,604 --> 01:17:36,834
- Les Grossman.
<i>- We not get money yet.</i>

1290
01:17:37,373 --> 01:17:39,500
Price now 100 million!

1291
01:17:39,609 --> 01:17:42,442
You pay now,
or tomorrow Simple Jack die.

1292
01:17:42,545 --> 01:17:45,605
Great. Let me get this down.

1293
01:17:45,715 --> 01:17:47,148
100 million.

1294
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:49,718
Wait! I got a better idea.

1295
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:52,351
Instead of 100 million,

1296
01:17:52,455 --> 01:17:55,322
how about I send you
a hobo's dick cheese?

1297
01:17:55,425 --> 01:17:57,723
<i>Then you kill him! Do your thing!</i>
<i>Skin the fucking bastard!</i>

1298
01:17:57,827 --> 01:18:00,022
Go to town, man! Go to town!

1299
01:18:00,129 --> 01:18:02,290
- No...
- In the meantime, and as usual,

1300
01:18:02,398 --> 01:18:04,059
go fuck yourself!

1301
01:18:05,168 --> 01:18:07,728
- No.
- We don't negotiate with terrorists.

1302
01:18:09,839 --> 01:18:12,569
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, are you insane?

1303
01:18:12,675 --> 01:18:14,506
- I think I could've done that better.
- I thought it was good.

1304
01:18:14,610 --> 01:18:16,475
They're gonna kill him!

1305
01:18:19,549 --> 01:18:20,607
And?

1306
01:18:22,952 --> 01:18:24,078
"And?"

1307
01:18:25,455 --> 01:18:29,482
It's a cold, hard world. Shit happens.

1308
01:18:31,794 --> 01:18:34,991
We'll weep for him, in the press.

1309
01:18:35,131 --> 01:18:37,793
Set up a scholarship in his name.

1310
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:41,836
Eventually, and I'm talking way,
way down the road,

1311
01:18:41,938 --> 01:18:43,428
we file an insurance claim.

1312
01:18:43,539 --> 01:18:46,337
Preferably before
the end of the fiscal year.

1313
01:18:46,442 --> 01:18:50,173
Actually, the claim alone would net us
more than the movie would lose.

1314
01:18:52,281 --> 01:18:54,044
You can't be serious.

1315
01:18:55,284 --> 01:18:56,842
You kick in the door to my house,

1316
01:18:56,953 --> 01:19:02,414
all ants in your pants,
sucking my left nut to get a TiVo scrap

1317
01:19:02,525 --> 01:19:07,121
for the third runner-up
Sexiest Man Alive 1998,

1318
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:09,596
and you're asking if I'm serious?

1319
01:19:13,469 --> 01:19:15,164
Let's face it.

1320
01:19:15,271 --> 01:19:19,298
The kids aren't dressing up as Scorcher
for Purim anymore.

1321
01:19:20,710 --> 01:19:23,702
Speedman is a dying star,

1322
01:19:23,813 --> 01:19:27,044
a white dwarf heading for a black hole.

1323
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:29,880
That's physics. It's inevitable.

1324
01:19:29,986 --> 01:19:33,319
We've been handed
an incredible opportunity here, Peck.

1325
01:19:33,423 --> 01:19:37,257
The universe is talking to us right now.

1326
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,918
You just gotta listen.

1327
01:19:52,041 --> 01:19:55,636
See, this is the good part, Pecker.
This is when the job gets fun.

1328
01:19:55,745 --> 01:19:56,837
Yeah.

1329
01:19:56,946 --> 01:20:00,109
Ask and you shall receive.

1330
01:20:01,150 --> 01:20:05,280
- All right.
- You play ball, we play ball.

1331
01:20:05,388 --> 01:20:08,755
I know you want the goodies.

1332
01:20:08,858 --> 01:20:10,849
Welcome to the goody room.

1333
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:15,590
You paying attention?
'Cause I'm talking G5 for the Pecker.

1334
01:20:15,698 --> 01:20:16,960
That's how you're gonna roll.

1335
01:20:17,066 --> 01:20:21,025
No more frequent flier
bitch miles for my boy.

1336
01:20:21,137 --> 01:20:22,434
Yeah!

1337
01:20:22,939 --> 01:20:24,201
Playa.

1338
01:20:25,074 --> 01:20:26,405
Playa!

1339
01:20:27,443 --> 01:20:28,740
Big dick playa.

1340
01:20:28,845 --> 01:20:30,836
Swinging past your knees!

1341
01:20:30,947 --> 01:20:31,971
Big dick, baby.

1342
01:20:32,081 --> 01:20:33,275
Yep.

1343
01:20:36,619 --> 01:20:39,213
Or you can grow a conscience

1344
01:20:39,322 --> 01:20:41,688
in the next five minutes
and see where that takes you.

1345
01:20:46,662 --> 01:20:48,755
Let me get this straight.

1346
01:20:48,865 --> 01:20:52,494
You want me
to let my client of 15 years,

1347
01:20:52,602 --> 01:20:53,967
one of my best friends,

1348
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:58,700
die in the jungle, alone,
for some money and a G5?

1349
01:20:59,842 --> 01:21:00,968
Yes.

1350
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:08,312
A G5 airplane?

1351
01:21:10,419 --> 01:21:11,477
Yes.

1352
01:21:12,555 --> 01:21:15,251
And lots of money.

1353
01:21:16,626 --> 01:21:18,787
Playa.

1354
01:21:21,697 --> 01:21:22,891
Yeah!

1355
01:21:24,133 --> 01:21:26,727
Smack it up, flip it, rub it down!

1356
01:21:29,305 --> 01:21:31,967
But Mama take care of Jack a lot.

1357
01:21:32,808 --> 01:21:36,539
How many more sleeps
before she wakes up again?

1358
01:21:36,646 --> 01:21:38,170
Sorry, Jack.

1359
01:21:38,281 --> 01:21:40,545
She in heaven now.

1360
01:21:41,317 --> 01:21:44,582
Damn! I thought the movie was bad.

1361
01:21:44,687 --> 01:21:47,815
She sleep forever.

1362
01:21:47,924 --> 01:21:51,052
To the man's credit, he's actually
eased up on the retard throttle.

1363
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:54,755
And now that's added a balance,
and the audience can connect.

1364
01:21:54,864 --> 01:21:58,664
I mean, this is Theater 101,
but, you know, he's had a tough road.

1365
01:21:58,768 --> 01:21:59,894
He'll become a naturalist.

1366
01:22:00,002 --> 01:22:01,697
- Yeah.
- Break down the aesthetic distance,

1367
01:22:01,804 --> 01:22:03,533
then the...

1368
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:07,835
Told you I'd tag you back.

1369
01:22:10,513 --> 01:22:12,777
Can I tell you that I'm sorry

1370
01:22:12,882 --> 01:22:15,180
for any offense I might've caused, man?

1371
01:22:15,284 --> 01:22:17,650
- I just got caught up in...
- In being a dumbass?

1372
01:22:17,753 --> 01:22:19,152
I guess so.

1373
01:22:19,255 --> 01:22:21,951
Why you still doing this
Chicken George shit, I have no idea.

1374
01:22:22,058 --> 01:22:23,355
- Neither do I.
- It's beyond me.

1375
01:22:23,459 --> 01:22:25,654
- It's beyond me.
- You confused.

1376
01:22:25,761 --> 01:22:27,695
- I am a little confused.
- I know.

1377
01:22:29,298 --> 01:22:31,095
But are we cool?

1378
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,531
Not really.

1379
01:22:36,339 --> 01:22:37,931
Hey, man.

1380
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,735
- How's it going?
- Good. Yourself?

1381
01:22:39,842 --> 01:22:41,867
Hey, so, if it's no big deal,

1382
01:22:41,978 --> 01:22:44,845
I think I'm just gonna hang back here
for the mission.

1383
01:22:44,947 --> 01:22:46,574
Watch the stuff.

1384
01:22:46,682 --> 01:22:48,707
- Is that cool?
- What? No!

1385
01:22:48,818 --> 01:22:50,718
We need you, Jeff.

1386
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:52,412
What are you talking about?

1387
01:22:52,521 --> 01:22:54,079
Okay, look, man.

1388
01:22:55,324 --> 01:22:57,622
- I got something to tell you.
- Okay.

1389
01:22:59,862 --> 01:23:02,592
You know those jellybeans
I was eating?

1390
01:23:02,698 --> 01:23:05,792
Well, they weren't jellybeans, okay?

1391
01:23:06,702 --> 01:23:09,500
- They were drugs.
- Really?

1392
01:23:09,605 --> 01:23:13,974
I get down there near the mother lode,
I am done. I'm jonesing bad, man.

1393
01:23:14,076 --> 01:23:17,011
I'm gonna fucking do all the heroin
in the fucking world.

1394
01:23:20,316 --> 01:23:24,480
If you guys wanna make it through
this thing, you gotta strap me to a tree.

1395
01:23:25,855 --> 01:23:29,621
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious. Literally, a tree.

1396
01:23:29,725 --> 01:23:32,592
And you can, no matter what, you can't
fucking untie me until it is done,

1397
01:23:32,695 --> 01:23:34,253
until it is out of my system.

1398
01:23:34,363 --> 01:23:35,990
I'm gonna say,
"Hey, man, I'm cool. It's cool.

1399
01:23:36,098 --> 01:23:37,656
"I'm finally better. I'm finally better.
Untie me."

1400
01:23:37,767 --> 01:23:40,964
Don't listen to me!
Anything I fucking say is a lie!

1401
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:42,401
You got it!

1402
01:23:43,072 --> 01:23:45,131
Goodbye, Mama!

1403
01:23:45,241 --> 01:23:48,369
Now you can have ice cream in heaven.

1404
01:23:48,477 --> 01:23:53,437
I'll see you tonight, when I go to bed,
in my head movies.

1405
01:23:54,383 --> 01:23:58,979
But this head movie
makes my eyes rain.

1406
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:11,261
Dang.
Short-bus is taking some real hits.

1407
01:24:13,135 --> 01:24:15,933
- They got him on the move!
- That's torture, man.

1408
01:24:16,072 --> 01:24:18,939
Okay. That's where they keeping him.

1409
01:24:19,041 --> 01:24:21,236
I gotta get cracking on my costume.

1410
01:24:21,343 --> 01:24:22,742
Say, are you good
with a needle and thread?

1411
01:24:22,845 --> 01:24:23,869
Hell, yeah.

1412
01:24:23,979 --> 01:24:27,312
Alpa Chino chinos sold more than
five million pairs last spring at the Gap.

1413
01:24:27,416 --> 01:24:30,112
- I sewed them patterns myself, baby.
- Let's roll out.

1414
01:25:02,118 --> 01:25:04,348
It's a little twig man Oscar.

1415
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,360
I'm going to call you Half Squat.

1416
01:25:15,064 --> 01:25:17,032
And you can call me

1417
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:19,397
Papa.

1418
01:25:42,892 --> 01:25:44,621
Wow, look at all those stars.

1419
01:25:46,595 --> 01:25:48,563
Really makes a guy feel pretty small.

1420
01:25:50,099 --> 01:25:52,659
This could be the last time
we look at these stars.

1421
01:25:53,636 --> 01:25:55,103
Man, that's beauty.

1422
01:25:57,039 --> 01:26:00,099
Nights like tonight
make a man wonder what it's all about.

1423
01:26:00,209 --> 01:26:02,507
Hey, you guys.
Anybody got some bug spray?

1424
01:26:04,346 --> 01:26:05,472
Don't ignore me!

1425
01:26:05,581 --> 01:26:08,448
Stick it out, man.
We're gonna get through this.

1426
01:26:09,585 --> 01:26:11,644
- Hey, Kirk?
- Yeah?

1427
01:26:11,754 --> 01:26:14,587
Are you still dating
Jennifer Love Hewitt?

1428
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:16,089
'Cause I think she's hot.

1429
01:26:16,192 --> 01:26:19,559
No, that was just some
tabloid conjecture.

1430
01:26:19,662 --> 01:26:23,655
Hey, guys, I'm good. I made it through.
You can untie me now.

1431
01:26:24,733 --> 01:26:26,064
Funny, huh?

1432
01:26:26,168 --> 01:26:29,069
The circus life 280 days a year
on location.

1433
01:26:30,306 --> 01:26:33,207
It's hard to find a girl
that can hang with that, you know?

1434
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:37,069
Not one worth keeping, nohow.

1435
01:26:37,179 --> 01:26:39,477
Hey, Radar? Evans?

1436
01:26:39,582 --> 01:26:40,640
No, it's Kevin.

1437
01:26:40,749 --> 01:26:42,478
Kev, whatever the fuck.
Come over here.

1438
01:26:42,585 --> 01:26:44,815
I didn't tell you, but <i>Fatties: Fart Three</i>
is coming down the pike,

1439
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:48,412
and there's a role in there for you
if you come over and untie me.

1440
01:26:48,524 --> 01:26:51,084
Jeff, you're just going to
have to tough it out.

1441
01:26:51,193 --> 01:26:53,161
Your mother's a cankerous whore!

1442
01:26:53,262 --> 01:26:54,593
Jesus, man.

1443
01:26:55,631 --> 01:26:57,098
Hey, man.

1444
01:26:57,199 --> 01:27:00,100
Remember way back when I said
your mother was a cankerous whore?

1445
01:27:00,202 --> 01:27:03,603
I'm sorry, man.
I did not mean that. She's not.

1446
01:27:03,706 --> 01:27:05,401
How about you, man?

1447
01:27:05,541 --> 01:27:07,975
You got some little minx waiting for you
on the other side of tomorrow?

1448
01:27:08,077 --> 01:27:09,544
Me?

1449
01:27:09,645 --> 01:27:12,409
I've barely even had a girlfriend, and...

1450
01:27:13,249 --> 01:27:16,912
I was really hoping I'd get laid
when this movie came out,

1451
01:27:17,019 --> 01:27:19,419
but that's not gonna happen.

1452
01:27:20,289 --> 01:27:21,756
What about you, Masterblaster?

1453
01:27:21,857 --> 01:27:24,485
You got a certain someone you trying
to get with back in the States?

1454
01:27:24,593 --> 01:27:29,326
What, Alpa Chino?
He's like 10 girls deep, 24/7.

1455
01:27:29,431 --> 01:27:30,659
No. You missing me, man.

1456
01:27:30,766 --> 01:27:32,563
I'm talking about something special.
Big difference.

1457
01:27:32,668 --> 01:27:33,862
How about it?

1458
01:27:34,637 --> 01:27:35,763
Yeah.

1459
01:27:37,172 --> 01:27:39,140
Yeah, there is.

1460
01:27:39,241 --> 01:27:42,574
Well? What's the skinny?
Y'all been on a date or what?

1461
01:27:42,678 --> 01:27:44,578
No. I mean...

1462
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:49,515
I always wanted to, but I guess
I just never had the courage to ask.

1463
01:27:49,618 --> 01:27:51,313
It's... It's complicated.

1464
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:53,854
No! It's simple as pie, man.

1465
01:27:53,956 --> 01:27:56,550
You plant your feet in the ground, you
look her square in the eyes, you say,

1466
01:27:56,659 --> 01:28:00,288
"Hey, baby, you and me's going
on a date." That's the end of story.

1467
01:28:00,396 --> 01:28:03,092
- What's her name?
- Lance.

1468
01:28:03,198 --> 01:28:04,961
"Listen here, Lance..."

1469
01:28:05,834 --> 01:28:09,634
Lance? What the fuck did I just hear?
Lance?

1470
01:28:09,738 --> 01:28:11,467
- Did you say "Lance"?
- No!

1471
01:28:11,573 --> 01:28:13,507
- That sounded like "Lance."
- No, I said "Nance."

1472
01:28:13,609 --> 01:28:15,770
- That's what I said, "Nance."
- It sounded like "Lance."

1473
01:28:15,878 --> 01:28:17,402
Look, I'm Alpa Chino, okay?

1474
01:28:17,513 --> 01:28:19,174
I love the pussy! All right?

1475
01:28:19,281 --> 01:28:21,181
Lay your ass back down
and look at the stars.

1476
01:28:21,317 --> 01:28:22,648
When you wrote <i>I Love Tha Pussy</i>

1477
01:28:22,751 --> 01:28:26,118
was you thinking of dangling your dice
on Lance's forehead?

1478
01:28:26,221 --> 01:28:28,587
Oh, hell, no! What? Come on. Look.

1479
01:28:28,691 --> 01:28:31,626
- Man, everyone's gay once in a while.
- I'm not gay!

1480
01:28:31,727 --> 01:28:32,751
This Hollywood.

1481
01:28:32,861 --> 01:28:33,919
How about we all get back to work?

1482
01:28:34,029 --> 01:28:35,690
- Okay. Cool.
- This is ridiculous!

1483
01:28:35,798 --> 01:28:38,699
We got a big day tomorrow.
Let's get focused.

1484
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:46,105
Alpa, if you untie me,
I will literally suck your dick right now.

1485
01:28:46,208 --> 01:28:49,439
I told you, for the last time,
I love the pussy!

1486
01:28:50,813 --> 01:28:53,646
I'll cradle the balls, stroke the shaft,

1487
01:28:53,749 --> 01:28:56,843
work the pipe and swallow the gravy.

1488
01:28:56,952 --> 01:28:59,011
Get it over here, buddy. Let's do this.

1489
01:29:05,594 --> 01:29:06,652
Okay, so, what's the plan?

1490
01:29:06,762 --> 01:29:08,161
Are you gonna talk Vietnamese
to those dudes?

1491
01:29:08,263 --> 01:29:10,026
No. No. Mandarin Chinese.

1492
01:29:10,132 --> 01:29:11,827
Which, from what I can tell,
is what they speaking down there.

1493
01:29:11,934 --> 01:29:13,492
How the hell do you know Chinese?

1494
01:29:13,602 --> 01:29:17,060
<i>Land of Silk and Money</i> with Gong Li.
Second Globe, third Oscar.

1495
01:29:17,172 --> 01:29:21,131
Prepped for that one by working in
a Beijing textile factory for eight months.

1496
01:29:21,243 --> 01:29:23,177
That might be our ride.

1497
01:29:39,928 --> 01:29:41,156
The straps are too tight!

1498
01:29:41,263 --> 01:29:43,629
Shut your mouth and follow my lead.

1499
01:30:11,527 --> 01:30:14,496
The straps are cutting off
my circulation!

1500
01:30:14,596 --> 01:30:15,563
Fuck you!

1501
01:30:23,072 --> 01:30:25,973
Not the fucking bull again.
Fucking asshole.

1502
01:31:20,028 --> 01:31:22,724
Laz, don't let him take me off the yak.

1503
01:31:27,236 --> 01:31:29,500
Bitch whore! Fucking hate you!

1504
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,842
Okay.

1505
01:31:43,051 --> 01:31:44,609
All right.

1506
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:47,120
That looks like it could be
the munitions hut right there.

1507
01:31:47,222 --> 01:31:49,281
I'm gonna try to find Speedman
in the main building.

1508
01:32:07,176 --> 01:32:10,873
I don't know Chinese but it sounds like
your improvising is for shit.

1509
01:32:10,979 --> 01:32:12,105
Oh, fuck!

1510
01:32:27,629 --> 01:32:29,221
Get over here!

1511
01:32:30,599 --> 01:32:32,157
- What are you guys doing here?
- He has hands.

1512
01:32:32,267 --> 01:32:34,667
- He killed Damien.
- Bullshit!

1513
01:32:34,770 --> 01:32:37,261
- He blinded Jamie Lee Curtis.
- Almost!

1514
01:32:37,372 --> 01:32:40,569
What are you talking about?
Damien stepped on a old landmine.

1515
01:32:40,676 --> 01:32:42,234
Sweet. Thank God.

1516
01:32:42,344 --> 01:32:44,539
- We busting Speedman out.
- Speedman's here?

1517
01:33:12,708 --> 01:33:15,302
I take it y'all are doing
the Wet Offensive from the book.

1518
01:33:15,410 --> 01:33:16,672
I can give y'all a diversion.

1519
01:33:16,778 --> 01:33:20,714
I got enough shit here to light this place
up like it's the Fourth of fucking July.

1520
01:34:02,190 --> 01:34:04,658
Yes, your farm.

1521
01:34:09,031 --> 01:34:11,431
Where is your farm,

1522
01:34:13,001 --> 01:34:14,468
American?

1523
01:34:17,306 --> 01:34:18,568
My farm?

1524
01:34:20,509 --> 01:34:21,771
Oh, shit.

1525
01:34:22,544 --> 01:34:25,741
Here's my motherfucking farm!

1526
01:34:25,847 --> 01:34:27,337
Yeah!

1527
01:34:32,287 --> 01:34:35,279
Yeah! Chicka-chickaw, baby!

1528
01:34:36,291 --> 01:34:37,485
Kwan-Lo!

1529
01:34:38,994 --> 01:34:40,894
I'm a lead farmer, motherfucker!

1530
01:34:41,396 --> 01:34:42,556
Yeah!

1531
01:34:44,132 --> 01:34:47,329
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
keep your head down!

1532
01:34:47,436 --> 01:34:49,700
Keep your head down on the ground!

1533
01:34:49,805 --> 01:34:51,966
Nobody move or I do the little big guy!

1534
01:34:52,074 --> 01:34:55,510
That's right,
we running this program now, J.P.

1535
01:34:55,610 --> 01:34:58,238
Now show me where the drugs are.

1536
01:34:58,347 --> 01:35:00,144
What the fuck?

1537
01:35:00,248 --> 01:35:01,943
That ain't the plan!

1538
01:35:02,050 --> 01:35:03,745
Don't judge me!

1539
01:35:07,422 --> 01:35:09,185
He's got a real serious problem.

1540
01:35:09,991 --> 01:35:12,255
Hey! Hey, you!

1541
01:35:12,361 --> 01:35:14,556
Take off your clothes!

1542
01:35:14,663 --> 01:35:16,324
Take off your clothes!

1543
01:35:16,431 --> 01:35:17,728
What do we do now?

1544
01:35:17,833 --> 01:35:19,664
Stick with the plan. Find Speedman.

1545
01:35:19,768 --> 01:35:22,168
Alpa, keep this clown posse down.
Come on now.

1546
01:35:22,270 --> 01:35:25,637
Y'all heard the man.
Be suede, don't move!

1547
01:35:25,741 --> 01:35:27,641
Fuck your do-rag. Fuck your do-rag.

1548
01:35:27,743 --> 01:35:30,234
- Door!
- One, two, three!

1549
01:35:43,525 --> 01:35:45,356
I go high, you go low.

1550
01:35:49,731 --> 01:35:53,599
Get down. Get down! Get down!
Chow Yun-Fat, get the hell down!

1551
01:35:53,702 --> 01:35:57,001
If I see one more head pop up,
it's gonna be bullet Whac-A-Mole.

1552
01:35:58,573 --> 01:36:00,006
Come on, come on!

1553
01:36:00,108 --> 01:36:02,099
- Smoke grenade.
- Don't drop it now.

1554
01:36:02,778 --> 01:36:04,336
Here.

1555
01:36:04,446 --> 01:36:06,548
- What's this?
- I don't know what it's called.

1556
01:36:06,548 --> 01:36:06,843
- What's this?
- I don't know what it's called.

1557
01:36:06,948 --> 01:36:09,542
I just know the sound it makes
when it lies.

1558
01:36:09,651 --> 01:36:13,178
Don't move, Matchbox,
or I will shoot you.

1559
01:36:13,288 --> 01:36:16,155
I'm gonna put on this thing. Don't move.

1560
01:36:16,258 --> 01:36:17,987
I can still see you.

1561
01:36:24,132 --> 01:36:25,224
Tugg!

1562
01:36:27,769 --> 01:36:28,929
Tugg?

1563
01:36:31,006 --> 01:36:32,200
Gotcha.

1564
01:36:33,375 --> 01:36:36,276
Roll your shit up, man. We going home.

1565
01:36:36,378 --> 01:36:37,504
Home?

1566
01:36:39,648 --> 01:36:43,482
But I'm doing five shows a day
for a standing-room-only crowd.

1567
01:36:43,585 --> 01:36:46,145
Don't you get it? I already am home.

1568
01:36:48,457 --> 01:36:51,585
All right, now, dude, you gotta get it...

1569
01:36:51,693 --> 01:36:53,888
My son gave this to me.

1570
01:36:53,995 --> 01:36:57,487
- That's your stick buddy?
- His name is Twigman.

1571
01:36:57,599 --> 01:36:59,430
Does he wanna come with us?

1572
01:37:20,422 --> 01:37:22,549
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1573
01:37:22,657 --> 01:37:27,617
Maybe y'all heard of me.
Y'all heard of Alpa Chino? No?

1574
01:37:27,729 --> 01:37:30,197
<i>I love that pussy, hell, yeah, hell, yeah</i>

1575
01:37:30,298 --> 01:37:31,424
They're not your demo, dude.

1576
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:34,300
Come on.
Six motherfucking VMAs, baby.

1577
01:37:34,402 --> 01:37:37,599
Two BET Awards. Alpa Chino.

1578
01:37:37,706 --> 01:37:44,111
Like him in <i>Carlito's Way?</i>

1579
01:37:44,479 --> 01:37:47,141
Hey, yo, you know what?
Speak English. I don't speak that stuff.

1580
01:37:47,249 --> 01:37:49,183
What're you sayin'? Huh?

1581
01:37:49,284 --> 01:37:53,846
<i>Devil's Advocate. Dog Day Afternoon.</i>

1582
01:37:54,222 --> 01:37:57,055
<i>Cruising. Sea of Love.</i>

1583
01:37:57,158 --> 01:38:00,150
Real Al Pacino.

1584
01:38:00,262 --> 01:38:03,857
Get the fuck down. That's a whole
different dude altogether.

1585
01:38:03,965 --> 01:38:07,025
What you doing? What you doing?
Don't touch that gun.

1586
01:38:07,135 --> 01:38:08,534
Don't do it! Don't touch that gun!

1587
01:38:08,637 --> 01:38:10,935
On my momma, if you touch that gun...

1588
01:38:15,577 --> 01:38:17,977
- Oh, shit, it's on!
- Over here!

1589
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:54,143
- What're you doing?
- I'm gonna give these boys

1590
01:38:54,249 --> 01:38:55,876
a Hanoi high-five.

1591
01:39:08,530 --> 01:39:09,895
Shadow me, Pinocchio!

1592
01:39:10,665 --> 01:39:11,893
Smoke!

1593
01:39:17,739 --> 01:39:19,434
Oh, shit!

1594
01:39:24,279 --> 01:39:25,803
Jeff, don't!

1595
01:39:26,648 --> 01:39:28,639
It doesn't matter what I do.

1596
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:31,719
I'll always be a screw-up.
No one'll ever respect me.

1597
01:39:31,820 --> 01:39:35,813
That is not true, you are not a screw-up!
You make so many people laugh.

1598
01:39:35,924 --> 01:39:38,154
They only laugh at my farts.

1599
01:39:38,259 --> 01:39:40,250
Jeff, we really need to go now!

1600
01:39:40,362 --> 01:39:41,954
This is all I deserve!

1601
01:40:02,117 --> 01:40:04,347
Laugh at that, you bastards!

1602
01:40:04,452 --> 01:40:07,853
Hilarious! Hilarious!

1603
01:40:09,391 --> 01:40:12,224
Let's move. We only have 16 hours
before they wake up.

1604
01:40:28,510 --> 01:40:30,102
Sounds like the dinner bell's ringing.

1605
01:40:30,211 --> 01:40:33,146
These assholes are gonna be crawling
in here ready to fucking eat us.

1606
01:40:36,084 --> 01:40:38,951
There. All right, you keep six right here.

1607
01:40:40,889 --> 01:40:43,050
Come on, let's go.

1608
01:40:43,158 --> 01:40:45,092
Come on, what are you guys doing?
Let's get out of here!

1609
01:40:45,193 --> 01:40:46,854
He's on tilt status.

1610
01:40:46,961 --> 01:40:50,920
Same thing happened to me when
I played Neil Armstrong in <i>Moonshot.</i>

1611
01:40:51,032 --> 01:40:53,125
They found me in an alley in Burbank

1612
01:40:53,234 --> 01:40:56,465
trying to re-enter the Earth's
atmosphere in an old refrigerator box.

1613
01:40:57,205 --> 01:40:58,263
What're you talking about?

1614
01:40:58,373 --> 01:41:00,739
Come on, fellas, we really need to go.

1615
01:41:00,842 --> 01:41:05,279
Daggomit, Blamtucky,
I ain't re-programming a VCR.

1616
01:41:11,186 --> 01:41:13,416
Give me the flame thrower.
You gotta start the chopper.

1617
01:41:13,521 --> 01:41:16,957
- No, fuck that! Just give me this.
- No time! I'll take care of this!

1618
01:41:18,193 --> 01:41:20,093
All right. Give me your hooks.

1619
01:41:20,195 --> 01:41:21,822
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna put them on again.

1620
01:41:21,930 --> 01:41:24,763
- Just give me your goddamn hooks.
- All right. Here.

1621
01:41:24,866 --> 01:41:27,027
Get those boys back to the bird, pronto!

1622
01:41:31,973 --> 01:41:34,134
Shit! Enough!

1623
01:41:34,242 --> 01:41:36,142
Fake shit!

1624
01:41:39,247 --> 01:41:40,373
Fuck!

1625
01:41:48,089 --> 01:41:51,252
Go get your guys!
Get them to the chopper!

1626
01:41:51,359 --> 01:41:53,452
I'll take care of these yahoos!

1627
01:41:55,497 --> 01:41:57,761
You're gonna focus up now,
motherfucker, and say it.

1628
01:41:57,866 --> 01:41:59,993
- "It's me, Tugg!"
- It's me, Tugg.

1629
01:42:00,101 --> 01:42:01,568
That's right! Now, Tugg who?

1630
01:42:01,669 --> 01:42:04,467
- Tugg who? I don't know. Who are you?
- Me?

1631
01:42:04,572 --> 01:42:06,267
I know who I am!

1632
01:42:06,374 --> 01:42:10,105
I'm a dude playing a dude
disguised as another dude.

1633
01:42:10,211 --> 01:42:11,269
What?

1634
01:42:11,379 --> 01:42:13,472
You a dude
that don't know what dude he is!

1635
01:42:13,581 --> 01:42:16,277
Or are you a dude who has no idea
what dude he is

1636
01:42:16,384 --> 01:42:17,646
and claims to know what dude he is...

1637
01:42:17,752 --> 01:42:19,515
What the fuck
are you guys talking about?

1638
01:42:19,621 --> 01:42:20,713
...by playing other dudes?

1639
01:42:20,822 --> 01:42:22,016
I know what dude I am!

1640
01:42:22,123 --> 01:42:24,921
- You're scared.
- I ain't scared. Scared of what?

1641
01:42:25,026 --> 01:42:26,288
Or scared of who?

1642
01:42:26,394 --> 01:42:28,988
- Scared of who?
- Come on, guys. We really need to go!

1643
01:42:29,097 --> 01:42:30,359
Scared of you.

1644
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:37,602
- Jesus.
- What's going on?

1645
01:42:37,705 --> 01:42:39,229
The dudes are emerging.

1646
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:40,671
He's right, you know.

1647
01:42:42,443 --> 01:42:43,842
I am not

1648
01:42:45,413 --> 01:42:47,108
Sergeant Lincoln Osiris.

1649
01:42:51,519 --> 01:42:52,986
We gotta roll out.

1650
01:42:53,087 --> 01:42:56,318
Nor am I Father O'Malley.

1651
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:01,495
Or Neil Armstrong.

1652
01:43:09,070 --> 01:43:11,231
I think I might be nobody.

1653
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,800
Wow!

1654
01:43:13,908 --> 01:43:16,570
The insecurity level
with you guys is ridiculous!

1655
01:43:17,846 --> 01:43:20,815
- Everybody's got issues!
- Yeah, man, everybody got issues.

1656
01:43:20,915 --> 01:43:23,475
Come on! You're Kirk Lazarus.

1657
01:43:23,585 --> 01:43:25,746
You're the whole reason
I got into acting.

1658
01:43:25,854 --> 01:43:27,685
I memorized every single monologue

1659
01:43:27,789 --> 01:43:30,383
you ever did
when I was in theater school.

1660
01:43:30,491 --> 01:43:32,516
- Really?
- Yeah. And look, Tugg!

1661
01:43:32,627 --> 01:43:35,061
I saw <i>Scorcher I
24 times when I was in eighth grade.

1662
01:43:35,163 --> 01:43:38,132
That shit blew me away!
I got high to that shit! You the man!

1663
01:43:38,233 --> 01:43:41,361
Yeah, man, <i>Scorcher I was great.
Let's get the fuck out of here!

1664
01:43:41,469 --> 01:43:45,599
Tugg, Tugger, you're the last piece
of the puzzle, buddy.

1665
01:43:45,707 --> 01:43:48,699
We need you! Your men need you!
Are you with us?

1666
01:43:53,047 --> 01:43:55,038
I'm a rooster illusion.

1667
01:43:55,149 --> 01:43:56,343
Fuck it. We'll deal with him later.

1668
01:43:56,451 --> 01:43:59,614
Let's move. Come on. Come on.
Double time. Gotta go!

1669
01:44:02,156 --> 01:44:03,953
Come on, come on, come on.

1670
01:44:07,729 --> 01:44:09,663
Bingo! Move out.

1671
01:44:11,599 --> 01:44:12,964
Oh, God.

1672
01:44:14,936 --> 01:44:17,803
Just say no to this,
you drug-making midget.

1673
01:44:22,377 --> 01:44:23,844
Gotta hold on!

1674
01:44:30,018 --> 01:44:31,383
Four Leaf!

1675
01:44:36,124 --> 01:44:37,455
You grew hands?

1676
01:44:46,701 --> 01:44:48,225
RPG, gentlemen!

1677
01:44:51,005 --> 01:44:52,529
Where are you going?

1678
01:44:58,046 --> 01:45:00,571
Oh, my God.
I am moving to catering after this.

1679
01:45:22,603 --> 01:45:23,934
My ass!

1680
01:45:27,175 --> 01:45:28,506
My ass!

1681
01:45:30,111 --> 01:45:33,376
Hey, yo!
We gotta get our shit together, Tugg!

1682
01:45:33,481 --> 01:45:35,711
We gotta get his cracker ass
to the chopper!

1683
01:45:35,817 --> 01:45:40,117
Are you still crazy?
We gotta get Candisky to the chopper!

1684
01:45:40,221 --> 01:45:41,688
It's Sandusky.

1685
01:45:43,558 --> 01:45:46,857
- Kevin Sandusky.
- That's my name.

1686
01:45:46,961 --> 01:45:48,553
You remembered my name.

1687
01:45:48,663 --> 01:45:50,688
Alpa, go help Cody.

1688
01:45:50,798 --> 01:45:52,789
Portnoy, get Sandusky
back to the chopper. Go!

1689
01:45:52,900 --> 01:45:54,731
- I got him!
- Let's go!

1690
01:45:56,170 --> 01:45:57,694
Let's get out of here!

1691
01:46:09,584 --> 01:46:11,074
Hey, Leaf!

1692
01:46:11,185 --> 01:46:12,413
- Leaf!
- Yeah.

1693
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:13,509
Hit the plunger

1694
01:46:13,621 --> 01:46:14,815
- as soon as they clear the bridge!
- Got it!

1695
01:46:20,061 --> 01:46:22,495
Come on! Get in the chopper!

1696
01:46:22,697 --> 01:46:25,495
- Come on! Move!
- Kirk! Wait!

1697
01:46:30,038 --> 01:46:31,665
Laz, I'm gonna blow the bridge!

1698
01:46:31,773 --> 01:46:33,570
Are you the special effects guy?

1699
01:46:33,674 --> 01:46:35,801
- You God damn right I am.
- Fuck yeah!

1700
01:46:36,210 --> 01:46:37,404
Leaf's about to blow the bridge.
Come on!

1701
01:46:37,512 --> 01:46:40,106
You don't have to! You don't have to!
I'm staying.

1702
01:46:40,214 --> 01:46:41,704
No, I can't let you do that, mate.
We gotta go.

1703
01:46:41,816 --> 01:46:44,341
No, I'm telling you, I'm not being crazy.
They'll listen to me.

1704
01:46:44,452 --> 01:46:46,943
I know it sounds weird,
but I have a connection with them.

1705
01:46:47,055 --> 01:46:49,853
You're not doing tofu dinner theater
for these motherfuckers. Let's roll!

1706
01:46:49,957 --> 01:46:53,791
- Get over here!
- I have a son now. Little Half Squat.

1707
01:46:53,895 --> 01:46:55,453
Who in crikey fuck is Half Squat?

1708
01:46:55,563 --> 01:46:57,793
He's my son. He's my boy!

1709
01:46:57,899 --> 01:47:00,333
He needs me. I have to go back to him.

1710
01:47:03,471 --> 01:47:05,132
You tell the world what happened here.

1711
01:47:05,239 --> 01:47:07,070
What happened here?

1712
01:47:07,175 --> 01:47:09,405
I don't know, but you need to tell them.

1713
01:47:11,779 --> 01:47:13,610
I got this.

1714
01:47:13,714 --> 01:47:14,874
Tugg!

1715
01:47:15,583 --> 01:47:19,144
You take care of the boys!
I'll deal with these guys.

1716
01:47:20,555 --> 01:47:24,150
Where is he going?
We're gonna fucking die!

1717
01:47:24,258 --> 01:47:26,886
Laz, come on. He joined the circus.
Let's go.

1718
01:47:26,994 --> 01:47:28,188
- You've got hands.
- Yeah.

1719
01:47:28,296 --> 01:47:30,423
- Fuck! You've got hands?
- Come on!

1720
01:47:31,499 --> 01:47:32,625
- Come on!
- Get in!

1721
01:47:32,733 --> 01:47:34,360
- Come on!
- He's staying?

1722
01:47:34,469 --> 01:47:36,733
Go! He's a lost cause, mate!
Get out of here!

1723
01:47:41,309 --> 01:47:45,803
I was wrong! Blow the bridge!
Blow the fucking bridge!

1724
01:47:51,652 --> 01:47:53,051
I got this.

1725
01:47:53,721 --> 01:47:55,154
Leaf, no!

1726
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:41,928
It's over! He's gone!

1727
01:48:42,036 --> 01:48:44,095
Cody! We gotta go!

1728
01:48:46,107 --> 01:48:47,301
Look.

1729
01:49:09,931 --> 01:49:11,262
Think he's done.

1730
01:49:11,365 --> 01:49:12,593
Cover me!

1731
01:49:13,668 --> 01:49:16,603
- Come on!
- Wait, come back!

1732
01:49:16,704 --> 01:49:18,433
How do we cover him?

1733
01:49:22,677 --> 01:49:26,078
All right, game over. Come on, mate.
Come on.

1734
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:28,774
- You all right, man?
- I'm cold.

1735
01:49:28,883 --> 01:49:30,874
I can't feel my legs.

1736
01:49:30,985 --> 01:49:33,920
No, no, they're in a puddle, mate. See?
There's a puddle right there.

1737
01:49:34,021 --> 01:49:35,215
- No worries.
- Good.

1738
01:49:35,323 --> 01:49:36,620
Come on, we gotta split, man.

1739
01:49:36,724 --> 01:49:39,022
- You guys came back for me.
- Course.

1740
01:49:39,126 --> 01:49:41,458
Hey! I want you to know something.

1741
01:49:41,562 --> 01:49:42,756
What?

1742
01:49:43,931 --> 01:49:45,728
I know who you are.

1743
01:49:47,835 --> 01:49:49,598
You're my friend.

1744
01:49:51,872 --> 01:49:53,499
You're my brother.

1745
01:49:54,375 --> 01:49:57,208
But like a really cool brother, you know?

1746
01:49:57,311 --> 01:49:58,676
Like a brother
where there was no animosity or...

1747
01:49:58,779 --> 01:50:01,612
Don't look now,
you got some real tears going.

1748
01:50:01,716 --> 01:50:02,705
Really?

1749
01:50:02,817 --> 01:50:04,307
That's the stuff
that accolades are made of.

1750
01:50:04,418 --> 01:50:05,885
Jesus, let's go, man!

1751
01:50:05,987 --> 01:50:07,088
All right?

1752
01:50:07,088 --> 01:50:07,452
All right?

1753
01:50:09,023 --> 01:50:10,456
Upsy-daisy.

1754
01:50:12,226 --> 01:50:15,218
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

1755
01:50:17,365 --> 01:50:18,662
Get in! Get in!

1756
01:50:18,766 --> 01:50:20,791
Come on! Here we go!

1757
01:50:23,337 --> 01:50:26,135
Tuggernuts! I got it!

1758
01:50:28,509 --> 01:50:30,807
- Tugger!
- Rick!

1759
01:50:33,414 --> 01:50:34,642
What the fuck?

1760
01:50:34,749 --> 01:50:36,376
I got the TiVo!

1761
01:50:37,285 --> 01:50:41,688
My friend wants a TiVo,
my friend gets a TiVo!

1762
01:50:46,861 --> 01:50:48,123
Oh, shit!

1763
01:51:24,965 --> 01:51:26,990
<i>And the Oscar goes to...</i>

1764
01:51:29,737 --> 01:51:32,035
<i>Yes! Tugg Speedman.</i>

1765
01:51:33,674 --> 01:51:36,370
"Tropic Blunder,
The True Story Behind the Making

1766
01:51:36,477 --> 01:51:39,002
"of the Most Expensive
Fake True War Story Ever."

1767
01:51:40,581 --> 01:51:41,707
Yeah!

1768
01:51:46,420 --> 01:51:48,320
Yeah, you son of a bitch!

1769
01:52:07,641 --> 01:52:12,010
Eight Oscars, $400 million

1770
01:52:12,113 --> 01:52:15,344
and you saved
Tugg Speedman's career.

1771
01:52:15,449 --> 01:52:18,316
I couldn't have done it
without you, Slolom.

1772
01:52:20,354 --> 01:52:21,446
Really?

1773
01:52:21,555 --> 01:52:23,546
No, dickhead, of course I could.

1774
01:52:23,657 --> 01:52:26,319
- A nutless monkey could do your job.
- Well, I...

1775
01:52:26,427 --> 01:52:29,328
Now, go get drunk
and take credit at all the parties.

1776
01:52:29,430 --> 01:52:32,126
- I would never do that to...
- Joking.

1777
01:52:32,233 --> 01:52:33,598
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1778
01:52:33,701 --> 01:52:35,896
Very... Okay, there he is.

1779
01:52:36,003 --> 01:52:37,493
- There he is. Okay.
- Go have fun.

1780
01:52:37,605 --> 01:52:39,129
All right. We're having a...

1781
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:41,640
Fuck, okay. Thank you, Les.
Thank you. You have a good night...

1782
01:52:41,742 --> 01:52:44,142
But seriously,
a nutless monkey could do your job.

1783
01:52:44,245 --> 01:52:45,974
Good. Thank you, sir.
