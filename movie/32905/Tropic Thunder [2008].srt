1
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:03,832
Alpa chino!

2
00:00:03,936 --> 00:00:07,069
We're loaded I love
the pussy, hell, yeah

3
00:00:07,172 --> 00:00:08,571
I love the pussy, hell, yeah

4
00:00:08,674 --> 00:00:11,336
I love that pussy
dripping down to the floor, oh, no

5
00:00:11,443 --> 00:00:13,934
the wettest pussy, hell, yeah
I love the pussy, hell, yeah

6
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:17,140
I'm drinking up
your Booty sweat and busting a nut

7
00:00:17,249 --> 00:00:19,012
alpa chino got that pussy control

8
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:21,018
alpa chino's Booty sweat.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,553
Pop an ass open!

10
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:26,147
Booty sweat and bust-a-nut bars
available at concessions now.

11
00:00:30,262 --> 00:00:34,392
In 2013, when the earth's rotation
came to a halt...

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,061
The president has declared
all of north America a disaster area.

13
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,866
I call on my fellow Americans
to come together...

14
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:45,000
The world called on the one man
who could make a difference.

15
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:53,075
When it happened again,
the world called on him once more.

16
00:00:54,486 --> 00:01:00,356
And no one saw it coming
three more times!

17
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:04,556
Now,

18
00:01:04,663 --> 00:01:08,599
the one man who made a difference
five times before,

19
00:01:11,036 --> 00:01:15,405
is about to make a difference again.

20
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:20,237
Only this time, it's different.

21
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:23,708
Who left the fridge open?

22
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,084
Tugg speedman.

23
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:31,953
Scorcher vl: Global meltdown.

24
00:01:32,057 --> 00:01:33,820
Here we go again.

25
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:36,361
Again.

26
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,837
Will there be anything else?

27
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,137
Yes, my dear man. More beans.

28
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:55,106
Granny!

29
00:01:57,049 --> 00:01:58,209
Please!

30
00:01:58,317 --> 00:02:03,277
This summer,
America's favorite obese family is back.

31
00:02:06,158 --> 00:02:07,716
Gross!

32
00:02:07,826 --> 00:02:09,851
- You're just mad 'cause I'm skinny.
- Am not!

33
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:11,919
Jeff portnoy.

34
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:14,065
Jeff portnoy.

35
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,156
Jeff portnoy.

36
00:02:16,268 --> 00:02:22,366
And Jeff portnoy are
the fatties: Fart two.

37
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:24,305
In some countries,

38
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:27,138
it's considered a compliment.

39
00:02:27,246 --> 00:02:30,443
Letting loose this summer.

40
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:45,459
In a time where to be different
was to be condemned,

41
00:02:59,211 --> 00:03:03,910
and to be condemned was to die,

42
00:03:08,153 --> 00:03:12,214
one man chose to question his God.

43
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,890
From fox searchlight,

44
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:29,969
five-time academy award winner
kirk Lazarus

45
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:35,410
and mtv movie award
best kiss winner tobey Maguire.

46
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:46,315
Winner of the Beijing film festival's
coveted crying monkey award,

47
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:49,517
Satan's alley.

48
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:56,557
I've been a bad, bad boy, father.

49
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,868
In the winter of 1969,

50
00:04:34,973 --> 00:04:36,998
an elite force of the U.S. army

51
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:41,978
was sent on a top-secret assignment
in southeast Vietnam.

52
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,844
The objective,
rescue sergeant four leaf tayback

53
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,010
from a heavily guarded
nva prison camp.

54
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,214
The mission was considered
to be near suicide.

55
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:55,823
Of the 10 men sent, four returned.

56
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:59,364
Of those four, three wrote books
about what happened.

57
00:04:59,464 --> 00:05:02,433
Of those three, two were published.

58
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:06,698
Of those two, just one got a movie deal.

59
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:13,440
This is the story of the men
who attempted to make that movie.

60
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:26,850
Whiskey fire old snake
requests an lz prep

61
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,519
at Alpha-delta-two-four-eight-niner,
over.

62
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:39,099
Floyd, this is lead. Right Echelon
approach from rp to lz, acknowledge.

63
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,002
Floyd, wall-eye airborne.
Welcome aboard.

64
00:05:45,844 --> 00:05:47,573
All right, lead's going in.
Give her some cover.

65
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:50,512
Delivery on five.
I repeat, delivery on five.

66
00:05:56,588 --> 00:05:58,886
This is zero-three.
I'm on your six, don't worry.

67
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:01,852
Chalk-three's taking fire.
Guns right, guns right.

68
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:16,032
Lay that shit down!

69
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:17,438
Come on!

70
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,576
Come on, you damn dirty heathens!

71
00:06:23,515 --> 00:06:25,710
Fats! Run your motherfucking ass
over there,

72
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:27,114
hold these men off, now!

73
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:28,914
We're fixing to lift off!

74
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,649
Put some pep in your step, dick!
Jelly-ass bitch!

75
00:06:31,757 --> 00:06:35,056
Wall-eye, wall-eye,
this is boomer one-seven in the zee!

76
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:39,295
I need fast movers
on my yankee smoke, copy?

77
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,764
Boomer, this is wall-eye.
I got two-Alpha-four

78
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:44,097
- snake and nape on the ready!
- Oh, Jesus! Holy shit!

79
00:06:44,202 --> 00:06:45,362
Holy shit!

80
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,267
Get on that horn
and get some firepower, boy!

81
00:06:47,372 --> 00:06:48,372
Jesus Christ!

82
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,532
Listen, you cherry fuck,

83
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:53,133
you call in that snake and nape
and get us some boom-boom now!

84
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:55,713
I'd do it myself
but I'm kind of goddamn busy!

85
00:06:55,814 --> 00:06:57,179
I need an answer, boomer!

86
00:06:57,282 --> 00:06:58,977
Wall-eye, wall-eye!

87
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,783
I copy!

88
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:03,317
We got beaucoup zips in the zee.

89
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:04,912
Rock and roll!

90
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,780
What the fuck?

91
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:21,171
That's for Brooklyn, motherfucker!

92
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:23,207
I think I can put it back in!

93
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:25,071
We got to get back to the bird.

94
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:26,269
Lukemeyer's got popped!

95
00:07:26,378 --> 00:07:29,313
This is the last Christmas
I spend with Victor Charlie up my ass!

96
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:32,177
Want some? Get some!

97
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:35,450
Hey, yo, fats! I ain't seen four leaf!

98
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:38,750
Don't count him out! That bastard's
got luck tattooed to his ass!

99
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,882
Motown, get your Detroit jukebox
jheri curl ass

100
00:07:41,993 --> 00:07:44,223
in this chickenshit chop-chop! Asafp!

101
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:46,209
Four leaf is still
outside the perimeter, sarge!

102
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:49,290
Miss me with that cracker chump jive!
We di di mau! We di di mau!

103
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:51,061
Come on, sarge. Stop jiving.
Four leaf is there.

104
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:52,864
Dead meat, soldier!

105
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:54,971
Or do you want to be a hero?

106
00:07:55,073 --> 00:07:57,073
That's just how Brooks
got his Jew ass killed, man.

107
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:59,771
And meatball's dago ass
bought the six-by-three farm.

108
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:03,575
Now get your ass up in the huey, before
I stomp a trench in your hiney hole!

109
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:06,582
Come on, get down, get down!

110
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:08,710
What am I looking at? What is this?

111
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:13,580
Come on, let's get, let's go!
Come on, elevator up, up!

112
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:16,217
Sarge. It's four leaf.

113
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:29,565
No!

114
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,434
You get out of that hole!

115
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,355
You make it home, now.

116
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,062
Survive!

117
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:12,874
I hope y'all like hamburger meat.

118
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:15,064
'Cause that's exactly what
I'm gonna be bringing back

119
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:17,178
and serving up in this whirly bird.

120
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:19,780
Cover me, you limp dick fuckups!

121
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,661
Peek-a-boo! I see you!

122
00:09:30,702 --> 00:09:32,431
Hold on, four leaf!

123
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:36,404
Oh, shit!

124
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,706
Watch my right!

125
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,455
Fuck you, Charlie!

126
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:57,691
Come on, leaf, let's boogie!

127
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,730
No!

128
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:13,002
- Fats!
- Holy fuck!

129
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,839
Take us over to those men! Shit!

130
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:24,288
Look at you, man.
Playing with grenades.

131
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:29,054
I'm cold, Linc.

132
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:32,927
I can't feel my legs.

133
00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:36,056
Ain't nothing but a thang.

134
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:40,969
Hey, Linc.

135
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,305
What, man?

136
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,636
Why does man

137
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:49,680
got to pick up sticks
against another man?

138
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:54,181
Instead of using them sticks to

139
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,146
prop a man up?

140
00:10:57,255 --> 00:10:58,882
I'll never know.

141
00:11:00,191 --> 00:11:04,358
Hold my hands, 'cause
I got something to...

142
00:11:04,462 --> 00:11:06,327
I got something to say.

143
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:09,393
Oh, boy.

144
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:16,234
- You holding 'em?
- I got 'em tight.

145
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:20,638
When we get back to the world,

146
00:11:21,112 --> 00:11:25,276
we gonna put together that three-piece
combo band we talked about?

147
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:28,375
- Me on stand-up bass.
- Johnny on drums.

148
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:31,981
And me tickling the ivories.

149
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:37,357
I ain't never been worth a nothing
in this life,

150
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:40,226
but I want you to know something.

151
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:42,596
What, man?

152
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:45,799
You are my...

153
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:49,000
You are my brother.

154
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:07,015
You are my brother.
You are my... you are my...

155
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:08,819
I am your brother.

156
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,059
I'm sorry. Could we cut?

157
00:12:14,165 --> 00:12:15,766
- What's he saying?
- Damien, can we cut?

158
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:17,428
- No. No, no, no, no, no...
- All right, you know what?

159
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,527
We got the jets coming in,
big explosion, two minutes.

160
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,731
Still rolling.

161
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,467
You know what? No, not still rolling.
Can we cut?

162
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:25,236
- We're cutting.
- No, we're not. Get out!

163
00:12:25,343 --> 00:12:27,343
Hey, what's going on?
For real, my butt is hurting!

164
00:12:27,412 --> 00:12:29,539
This harness is riding up my crack!

165
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:32,116
- Damien, are we cutting?
- No! No! Still rolling!

166
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:34,344
Mr. cockburn! Are we cutting, sir?

167
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:37,615
No! No. I'm not cutting!
We're still rolling!

168
00:12:37,722 --> 00:12:38,780
Damien, what's the dealy, dude?

169
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,687
Are we gonna blow
this tree line or what?

170
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:42,353
Tuk tuk and Kim
got the blue balls here.

171
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,688
I'm gonna let them squirt if we're a go!

172
00:12:43,795 --> 00:12:46,115
- Play it through. Still rolling!
- Dieter, can he hear me?

173
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:48,691
That's c-4, dipshit. Put that back.
I said a detonator.

174
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,166
I need some dudes up here
who speak American, God damn it!

175
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:52,830
He's making
a fucking sweater back here.

176
00:12:52,837 --> 00:12:55,169
I'm trying to put tiger balm
on this jungle's nuts.

177
00:12:55,273 --> 00:12:56,433
Everyone, please shut up.

178
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,742
The jets are coming in.
We only have one chance at this!

179
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,209
And go!

180
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:02,609
Let's do it. You feel it?
You feel me?

181
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,981
- You are my...
- I am your brother.

182
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:08,316
We've seen it all, man.

183
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,054
I'm sorry, Damien?

184
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:11,452
Are you seeing that?

185
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:13,956
The little froggy on the boom Mike?
It's right in my eyeline.

186
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,555
Donny! What's up, man?

187
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:19,196
It's been there the whole show.

188
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,354
Yeah, well it's right in my face,

189
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:21,454
I'm staring at a frog,
I'm trying to feel...

190
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:24,126
It's always the yellow frog that
brings them black frog on Fridays, man.

191
00:13:24,235 --> 00:13:25,930
Hell, no, I didn't pee on that girl.

192
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:28,130
No, I didn't pee on her,
listen, listen, listen, listen. No, no.

193
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:30,764
The story is this. She was in the way
when I was peeing, she walked past.

194
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,241
What the fuck is going on here?

195
00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:35,505
On three, baby. One, two, breathe.

196
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:38,138
Look, do me a favor. I don't want to do
a countdown before I do the scene.

197
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:39,307
- No countdown?
- No countdown.

198
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:40,611
- Okay.
- Can we just do it off of "action"?

199
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,277
Just... in your own time.

200
00:13:42,387 --> 00:13:44,184
- Good...
- I'm not a rocket ship, okay?

201
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:45,916
- All right, dude.
- And action!

202
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:48,959
Whatever floats your boat, baby.
Fuck! Don't die!

203
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,494
Erika, get me a vitaminwater!

204
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:53,157
You know what it is, Damien? I'm sorry.

205
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:57,567
Not to get into his thing, but if
I'm crying, should osiris be crying, too?

206
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:59,569
- No, it's everyone cry...
- We cutting or we crying?

207
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:01,002
- No, no, no, we're crying!
- Just call it, man!

208
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,233
- Kirk, you can cry. Tugg, you can cry.
- Thanks!

209
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:05,070
- Everybody cry...
- You know what?

210
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:07,144
- You see how agitated he is now?
- I know.

211
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:09,725
- Let's make lemonade. Let's go to work.
- Okay. Still rolling!

212
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:12,743
This is falcon one. We have the Ridge
in sight, approximately two Miles out.

213
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,115
Dieter, these jets
are about to crest this Ridge line.

214
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,154
They got about 200 pounds
of shit your pants.

215
00:14:17,255 --> 00:14:18,695
I need to know if we're ready to go.

216
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:23,357
- You're my... you're my...
- I am your...

217
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:26,919
See, that's what I think it is, Damien.
I think it's the line.

218
00:14:27,031 --> 00:14:28,055
Yeah?

219
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,031
I don't know if four leaf
would say that... four leaf?

220
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,467
Were you crying
when your hands blew up?

221
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,197
No. See, he didn't.
Yeah, I mean, just that's what...

222
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:35,863
So now we in re-writes, right?

223
00:14:35,974 --> 00:14:37,100
- Where you going?
- Let's re-write it!

224
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,369
Action Jackson can't cry.
That's what's going down.

225
00:14:39,477 --> 00:14:41,445
You know what, kirk?
I'm ready to do the scene!

226
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:45,107
What scene? The scene is
about emotionality. Where is it?

227
00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:46,808
- Now it's time to flip the script!
- Kirk...

228
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:49,119
Be here till Chinese new year
waiting for my man to cry.

229
00:14:49,287 --> 00:14:51,255
You're tangling me,
you're fucking tangling me.

230
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:52,636
You're tangling me, God damn it!

231
00:14:52,657 --> 00:14:55,490
- Kirk, no!
- Stop tailgating me, you pasty tea bag!

232
00:14:55,593 --> 00:14:57,390
I'm going potty.
You want to hold my dick?

233
00:14:57,862 --> 00:15:00,626
Shit! What are you fucking both doing,
good lord!

234
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,324
We're getting this in a wide shot, right?

235
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:04,958
Of course we're getting it
in a fucking wide.

236
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:06,093
What, do you think
I'm a dick or something?

237
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:09,339
Get that fucking food...
Here they come!

238
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:12,841
- The planes are inbound!
- Shit! Shit!

239
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:17,847
Shit, shit, cocksucker, bollocks.
Tropic tits!

240
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:20,918
That's the signal! Go, go, go, go, go!

241
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:23,078
Let's go freaking tet here!

242
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,179
Goddamn shit-picking cock!

243
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:28,884
That's my shit!

244
00:15:34,432 --> 00:15:37,367
Mother nature just pissed her pantsuit!

245
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:46,471
- Sweet.
- Oh, mama!

246
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,544
Bungle in the jungle.

247
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:54,743
More bad news from the vietnamese set
of tropic thunder,

248
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:58,584
where a $4 million explosion
charred the Asian location

249
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,658
and the camera wasn't even rolling.

250
00:16:00,758 --> 00:16:03,420
Financed by hotheaded mega-mogul
les Grossman,

251
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:06,622
the film is already rumored to be
one month behind schedule

252
00:16:06,731 --> 00:16:09,598
just five days into shooting.
The reason?

253
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:12,636
Fingers are pointed at rookie director
Damien cockburn,

254
00:16:12,737 --> 00:16:15,831
who, insiders say,
can't control a star-studded cast,

255
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,639
including flatulent star of the popular
fatties franchise, Jeff portnoy.

256
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:23,270
Let me tell you something.
A lot of people are disrespecting me.

257
00:16:23,381 --> 00:16:27,112
They say that the movie's
just about farts. It's about family,

258
00:16:27,218 --> 00:16:30,312
and... you! You can't do what I do.

259
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:34,653
Fresh from his most recent arrest
for heroin, glue and crack possession,

260
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:37,125
portnoy was almost uninsurable.

261
00:16:37,228 --> 00:16:41,562
Also in the mix is Booty sweat-hocking
hip-hop hyphenate alpa chino.

262
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,157
I'm so excited, you know what I'm
saying, about doing tropic thunder.

263
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,430
Hey, drink Booty sweat, baby.
Drink Booty sweat.

264
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:48,198
But the real heavyweight on the set

265
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,217
is five-time academy award winner
kirk Lazarus.

266
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,082
Is five-time academy award winner
kirk Lazarus.

267
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:54,840
The brilliant Australian
known for his bad boy antics off-screen

268
00:16:54,946 --> 00:16:58,541
is famous for his total immersion
into any role he portrays.

269
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,947
Well, being an actor is no different

270
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:02,246
than being a rugby player
or a construction worker,

271
00:17:02,353 --> 00:17:03,479
save for the fact that my tools

272
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:05,647
are the mechanisms
that trigger human emotion.

273
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:07,816
Lazarus underwent a controversial

274
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,918
pigmentation alteration procedure
in order to play

275
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:14,123
the platoon's African-American
sergeant, Lincoln osiris.

276
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:15,665
Yeah!

277
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:17,632
Trying to hold his own onscreen
with kirk

278
00:17:17,735 --> 00:17:19,862
is action juggernaut tugg speedman.

279
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:22,769
Once the highest grossing star
in the world,

280
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:25,934
lately his scorcher films
have lost their heat.

281
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:28,638
Recently, speedman opened up to Tyra.

282
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:30,680
You have no real family.

283
00:17:30,782 --> 00:17:35,219
You're on the wrong side of 40.
You're childless and alone.

284
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,015
Somebody close to you said,

285
00:17:37,121 --> 00:17:39,919
"one more flop and it's over."

286
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:44,119
Somebody said they were close to me?

287
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:46,189
It's been a tough year for tugg.

288
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:49,061
The disappointing buddy comedy
chitlin' & the dude

289
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:53,831
was followed by an ill-advised venture
into serious dramatic territory.

290
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:55,030
Simple Jack,

291
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:58,870
the story of a mentally impaired
farmhand who can talk to animals,

292
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,842
was a box office disaster

293
00:18:00,945 --> 00:18:05,541
that many critics called,
"one of the worst movies of all time."

294
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:09,279
I ain't got a good brain.

295
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:13,189
I think you've got a fine brain, Jack.

296
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:18,456
You make me happy.

297
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:24,435
But now the question is,
can speedman make audiences happy

298
00:18:24,535 --> 00:18:26,298
in what's being called
the most expensive

299
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:28,668
- war movie never made?
- Rick peck.

300
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:30,293
Wishing tugg all the best on that one.

301
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:34,709
Rum-tum-tuggernauts, it's the pecker.
You got time for your agent?

302
00:18:34,812 --> 00:18:36,074
- Rick?
- Hey, buddy,

303
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,738
guess who I'm staring at right now.

304
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:39,510
- What?
- I'm looking at your ugly mug

305
00:18:39,617 --> 00:18:41,915
on the back cover
of vanity fair magazine,

306
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,454
holding a cute, cuddly panda
from cutesville.

307
00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:47,149
It is insane, bro. You are a rock star.

308
00:18:47,258 --> 00:18:49,852
Hey, did you get the gift basket I sent?

309
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:50,985
From Rick.

310
00:18:51,095 --> 00:18:53,188
Yeah. Yeah. It's cool, man. Thanks.

311
00:18:53,297 --> 00:18:55,857
All right,
that is a real satellite phone, bro.

312
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:57,559
Do not re-gift.

313
00:18:57,668 --> 00:19:00,159
Hey. You see
that access Hollywood piece?

314
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:03,206
Yeah, I did.
It was like pistol-whipping a blind kid.

315
00:19:03,307 --> 00:19:07,744
I mean, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,
tugg. You are a huge star, all right?

316
00:19:07,845 --> 00:19:09,312
But right now,

317
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:10,972
you're like that kid on the playground,
you know,

318
00:19:11,082 --> 00:19:14,051
the one who has lice that none
of the other kids want to play with?

319
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:16,232
- What do you mean?
- I mean we gotta shave your head

320
00:19:16,254 --> 00:19:18,722
and get you back
on the monkey bars, right?

321
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:20,154
What?

322
00:19:20,258 --> 00:19:22,123
How did the crying scene go?

323
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:23,989
Horrible. Lazarus started crying.

324
00:19:24,095 --> 00:19:27,258
Then he starts drooling and dribbling,
and it wasn't even in the script...

325
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:28,457
Stop right there!

326
00:19:28,566 --> 00:19:30,295
You gotta buck up here, tuggboat.

327
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:33,097
Who cares how much more talented
he may be than you?

328
00:19:33,204 --> 00:19:36,571
If he cries, you cry harder, man.

329
00:19:36,674 --> 00:19:38,835
Didn't your dog have, like, leukemia
or something

330
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:40,308
when you were a kid?
I mean, think of that.

331
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:44,177
Boom! End of story.
They hook up the TiVo yet?

332
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:45,544
Good gosh.

333
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,481
- What?
- The TiVo, they hook it up?

334
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:49,849
- No. The guy didn't come.
- What?

335
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:52,548
For fuck's sake, that is unacceptable.

336
00:19:52,657 --> 00:19:54,557
They have digital cable, but,
I mean, it's okay.

337
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:56,889
No, no, no. Come on, man. It's not okay.

338
00:19:56,994 --> 00:19:59,121
It is not okay, tugg!

339
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,358
And you don't need to explain to me
why you need TiVo

340
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:06,403
or clean water, clean sheets,
food, shelter.

341
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:09,598
I mean, I fought for that in your contract.

342
00:20:09,707 --> 00:20:11,766
How's the adoption thing coming,
buddy?

343
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:13,901
Not too great.

344
00:20:17,148 --> 00:20:19,844
I feel like all the good ones are gone.

345
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:23,817
Well, at least you get to choose yours.

346
00:20:23,921 --> 00:20:25,752
I'm stuck with mine.

347
00:20:27,658 --> 00:20:30,183
Tell you what, get back to work,
genius soldier.

348
00:20:30,294 --> 00:20:33,161
The pecker's on a TiVo mission
for the y-o-u.

349
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:35,027
Work on those tears, my man.

350
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,225
All right. Yeah.

351
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:37,892
Say it for me one time.

352
00:20:38,002 --> 00:20:42,268
- You make me happy.
- Make me happy.

353
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:43,965
- I love you, buddy.
- All right, bye.

354
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,867
Crisis meeting?
What does that mean, exactly?

355
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:48,639
I mean, are we in a crisis?

356
00:20:48,746 --> 00:20:50,270
He's the head of the studio.

357
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:52,747
He's reaching out.
We're 10,000 Miles away.

358
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:53,942
He just wants a little face-time.

359
00:20:54,051 --> 00:20:56,732
I know, it's just you said
that he called it a crisis meeting. So...

360
00:20:56,754 --> 00:20:59,154
It's les Grossman.
He throws these words around.

361
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:03,660
"Crisis," "explosion,"
"not rolling," "fired."

362
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:05,092
These are just words.

363
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:07,289
Yeah! Yeah!

364
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:10,697
Keep a secret? A camera truck
in London just plowed into judi dench.

365
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:11,927
Trust me, he's got bigger problems.

366
00:21:12,036 --> 00:21:14,504
Look, he may be able to see me,
but I can't see him.

367
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:19,133
- Move! Move! Hello, les! Hello!
- Get your ass out of my...

368
00:21:19,243 --> 00:21:20,676
- Your feet were on my desk.
- Can he see us?

369
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:22,109
I don't know why we don't have...

370
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:24,374
Get him a diet coke. Les! It's working!

371
00:21:24,482 --> 00:21:26,973
Yeah, whatever you're doing right there.
Hello, les!

372
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:28,483
- Hello, les!
- Okay.

373
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:30,645
We got you loud and clear here, les.

374
00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:34,452
I see you. I see you. I see you.

375
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,687
Which one of you fuckfaces
is Damien cockburn?

376
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:40,220
That's me, sir.

377
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:43,858
It's good to finally meet you at last,
get some face-time.

378
00:21:43,968 --> 00:21:47,927
And who here is the key grip?
You? You.

379
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:53,399
Hit that director in the face,
really fucking hard.

380
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:01,615
Sorry, man.

381
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:11,026
This is your fault, you limey fuck!

382
00:22:11,128 --> 00:22:12,993
You shit the money-bed, my friend.

383
00:22:13,097 --> 00:22:15,622
- What?
- God damn it, Damien!

384
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:18,827
With all due respect, les Grossman did
not blow up the jungle.

385
00:22:18,936 --> 00:22:20,028
- What?
- Fuck the jungle.

386
00:22:20,137 --> 00:22:21,468
Exactly!

387
00:22:22,173 --> 00:22:23,640
Come on, man.

388
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:27,105
Hey, les, I understand if you're angry,

389
00:22:27,211 --> 00:22:29,202
but I am dealing
with a bunch of prima Donnas!

390
00:22:29,313 --> 00:22:32,805
Clowns! Tugg speedman, he can't cry!
He can't cry!

391
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:35,317
You know how you handle an actor?
They whine about anything,

392
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:38,718
you pull down their pants
and you spank their ass.

393
00:22:38,823 --> 00:22:41,018
- You spank that ass, les.
- What?

394
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:44,891
Spanking a child
turns him into a little snot.

395
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:48,664
Fear makes him a man.

396
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,296
I know a place
where a man's worth is measured

397
00:22:54,405 --> 00:22:58,205
in the ears hanging from his dog tags.

398
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:01,039
The real deep shit.

399
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:03,739
You wanna make this movie right?

400
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:07,340
That's where you take
your pansy-ass actors.

401
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:10,784
Who is this guy?

402
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:12,788
Les, that's four leaf.

403
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:16,189
Sergeant four leaf tayback.
I wrote the book.

404
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:22,457
You're a great American.
This nation owes you a huge debt.

405
00:23:22,566 --> 00:23:25,535
Now shut the fuck up
and let me do my job!

406
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,871
- Look, cockburn.
- Yes.

407
00:23:27,972 --> 00:23:31,999
From now on, my fist
is gonna be so far up your shithole

408
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:33,509
that every time you have a thought,

409
00:23:33,577 --> 00:23:36,603
it's gonna have to tiptoe
past my wedding ring.

410
00:23:36,714 --> 00:23:40,241
Take control of your actors,
or I will shut you down.

411
00:23:40,351 --> 00:23:41,443
Diet coke!

412
00:23:59,203 --> 00:24:01,398
One week down, two weeks behind,

413
00:24:01,505 --> 00:24:05,305
gi Joe can't cry, don't matter 'cause you
ain't got the camera turned on anyway.

414
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:06,808
Let's party!

415
00:24:07,745 --> 00:24:09,645
Man, you better get your shit straight,

416
00:24:09,747 --> 00:24:12,614
or I'll be on the next netjet out of here,
baby. You feel me?

417
00:24:13,484 --> 00:24:14,484
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

418
00:24:14,552 --> 00:24:17,077
Here comes another.
There we go. Now what?

419
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,787
- Sandusky. Good.
- Hey, Mr. cockburn.

420
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,755
We need to have a cast meeting
right now.

421
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:23,156
- Right now? Awesome.
- Yes.

422
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,454
You actually care, don't you?

423
00:24:24,562 --> 00:24:27,156
Yeah, it's a huge deal for me,
are you kidding?

424
00:24:27,264 --> 00:24:29,232
I've spent the past two years of my life

425
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:33,030
living off residuals from a anti-herpes
medication commercial.

426
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:34,297
I know, you're the only one
who auditioned,

427
00:24:34,405 --> 00:24:35,963
the only one who did
the two-week boot camp.

428
00:24:36,073 --> 00:24:37,734
Hey, hey, alpa.

429
00:24:38,442 --> 00:24:40,910
I'm the director. He's...
I need to speak to my actor.

430
00:24:41,011 --> 00:24:42,239
All right, hold up. Chino?

431
00:24:42,346 --> 00:24:44,109
What? Hell, yo. What's up, baby?

432
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:46,539
This about
the Booty sweat cross-promotion?

433
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:47,674
No, it's about the film.

434
00:24:47,785 --> 00:24:49,776
Oh, the film and Booty sweat's
the same thing. Give him a shot.

435
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:52,281
Hey, how you doing, Jeff?

436
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,848
- Who are you?
- That's awesome, man.

437
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:02,862
Kevin. Kevin sandusky. I play Brooklyn,
we've been working together.

438
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:04,559
Oh, right, right. I like you.

439
00:25:04,668 --> 00:25:06,636
Man, it's a real honor to be here...

440
00:25:06,737 --> 00:25:08,034
I can tell it's gonna be
a good experience.

441
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:09,339
I'm really having a good time.

442
00:25:09,373 --> 00:25:11,000
Hey, can you help me out, man?
I'm looking for this guy.

443
00:25:11,108 --> 00:25:15,272
The grip with the bandana.
He's got a package for me.

444
00:25:15,746 --> 00:25:18,146
There he is, fucker. Dragon!

445
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,081
What the fuck? Oh, buddy!

446
00:25:21,218 --> 00:25:22,583
I'm gonna go shoot a video, right?

447
00:25:22,686 --> 00:25:24,813
I'm gonna have v.C. Soldiers
in the video

448
00:25:24,922 --> 00:25:26,219
doing the noodle-legs, Damien.

449
00:25:26,323 --> 00:25:30,692
Hell, yeah, do it. V.C. Soldiers doing
the hip-hop bunny hop, Damien.

450
00:25:30,928 --> 00:25:32,688
It's good, I love it, great.
But I need to...

451
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:35,688
V.C. Soldiers doing the seizure, baby.
Hit it, baby.

452
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:37,494
Hell yeah, get it. Get it, cornbread.

453
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,830
Alpa!

454
00:25:40,938 --> 00:25:42,418
Yo, check it out. Donny on the phone.

455
00:25:42,473 --> 00:25:43,473
Hello? Yo, yo, Donny!

456
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,661
Can we call him back?
I've got to have a cast meeting.

457
00:25:49,146 --> 00:25:51,478
When we put aside our differences,

458
00:25:51,582 --> 00:25:54,449
we see we're kind of the same.

459
00:25:55,352 --> 00:25:58,879
When we put aside our differences,
we see

460
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,423
we're kind of the same.

461
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:04,991
Let's be friends.

462
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:07,924
I know we can do great things together.

463
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:13,800
That's a quotation from
a children's book I co-wrote,

464
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,699
the boy everybody was jealous of.

465
00:26:16,807 --> 00:26:18,536
I think it pertains to the journey...

466
00:26:18,642 --> 00:26:19,973
Simple Jack sucked ass!

467
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:23,445
All right, who said that? It's not funny.

468
00:26:23,547 --> 00:26:25,310
Whoever it is, it's not funny, okay?

469
00:26:32,623 --> 00:26:35,319
When the herd loses its way,

470
00:26:35,426 --> 00:26:39,863
the Shepherd must kill
the bull that leads them astray.

471
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:44,964
- Four leaf?
- Come on over. It's okay.

472
00:26:46,637 --> 00:26:48,127
- Sit down.
- Yes.

473
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:54,637
- So, you don't like the hotel?
- Beds give me nightmares.

474
00:26:59,683 --> 00:27:04,882
I'm guessing right about now
you couldn't find a Dixie coonskin

475
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:09,323
with an Ohio hooker holding your prick
and showing you the way.

476
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:17,464
What?

477
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:19,293
You're a riddle

478
00:27:20,804 --> 00:27:23,739
with no cheese to maze through.

479
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:26,643
Don't you get it?

480
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:30,441
No, I don't. I'm a cock of the mouse
or something. I don't know.

481
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:34,484
I put my story in your limp brit hands,

482
00:27:34,585 --> 00:27:38,021
and you are not going to fail me.

483
00:27:38,122 --> 00:27:41,717
You think I was just blowing
my own bagpipe in that meeting?

484
00:27:41,825 --> 00:27:45,659
You must put those boys in the shit.

485
00:27:45,763 --> 00:27:47,321
What? I don't understand.

486
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:50,696
- You wanna make your movie or not?
- Yes, I do.

487
00:27:50,801 --> 00:27:54,293
All right, you get
some of those little video type cameras.

488
00:27:54,405 --> 00:27:58,034
We take them out there, and we put
them in the trees in different angles.

489
00:27:58,142 --> 00:28:01,475
Then you give me
and that pyromaniac Cody

490
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:06,448
all the smoke bombs, charges,
explosives, detonators you got.

491
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,984
Then we take those boys up there,

492
00:28:09,086 --> 00:28:12,180
me and Cody,
we could light up that fucking jungle,

493
00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:15,224
so those lily-dick actors
would be shitting their pants

494
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,317
and screaming for their mammies.

495
00:28:17,428 --> 00:28:20,886
They'd be begging for a body bag
if it means a ride home.

496
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:25,258
I could do it.

497
00:28:26,036 --> 00:28:29,472
I could shoot the whole thing
guerrilla style. Gritty, dirty.

498
00:28:29,573 --> 00:28:32,906
Get them away from their helpers
and ass-licking assistants.

499
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,102
Put them in the real shit.

500
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:35,405
- Real shit.
- With real fear in their eyes!

501
00:28:35,512 --> 00:28:38,572
Real fear, real emotion!
Yes, four leaf, yes!

502
00:28:38,682 --> 00:28:40,775
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

503
00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:42,647
Take them off the fucking grid!

504
00:29:00,104 --> 00:29:02,868
You are no longer actors in a movie!

505
00:29:03,974 --> 00:29:06,704
You are five men in a helicopter!

506
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:10,242
With three other men!

507
00:29:15,886 --> 00:29:17,410
How long are we gonna be gone,
anyways?

508
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:21,582
'Cause I left most of my vitamins
back at the hotel.

509
00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:24,252
- Save your breath, maggots!
- That's right, maggots!

510
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,602
M&M?

511
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,807
M&M?

512
00:30:00,597 --> 00:30:04,133
Go, go, go! Get out of the chopper!

513
00:30:04,568 --> 00:30:07,731
Move it, maggots, move!
Move, grunts, move your ass!

514
00:30:07,838 --> 00:30:10,136
Get out, you wriggly worms!

515
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,708
- It's up too high!
- Move, move, move!

516
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,909
See you in hell!

517
00:30:29,426 --> 00:30:33,624
This is bullshit!
I gotta at least call my fucking assistant.

518
00:30:34,898 --> 00:30:37,628
Fucking! Jesus! Dude!

519
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:41,333
You're sitting on a nest
of hostile enemy v.C.

520
00:30:41,438 --> 00:30:44,874
Congratulations, fats.
You just got us all killed.

521
00:30:45,876 --> 00:30:49,471
Anybody else care to give away
our position to Charlie?

522
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,343
Cell phones!

523
00:30:51,448 --> 00:30:52,915
What the hell, Damien?

524
00:30:53,016 --> 00:30:56,713
Weren't no cell phones in '69, man.
I'm head-to-toe legitimate.

525
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,221
Gentlemen, I've got good news
and bad news.

526
00:31:00,324 --> 00:31:03,816
The studio wants to shut us down.
That's the bad news.

527
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:06,259
And the good news.

528
00:31:06,363 --> 00:31:09,264
If you wanna save this movie,
you will become a unit.

529
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:13,132
Your objective is to head north
to the d'ang kwook river

530
00:31:13,237 --> 00:31:14,727
and liberate the pow camp,

531
00:31:14,838 --> 00:31:18,103
at which point four leaf
will get himself captured,

532
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:20,005
at which point you will rescue him,

533
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,477
at which point
we will chopper you home!

534
00:31:24,681 --> 00:31:25,773
Damn.

535
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:27,680
Four leaf,
since you're the staff sergeant,

536
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:30,185
there's the map, this is the scene list.

537
00:31:30,287 --> 00:31:32,414
Think you can handle it?

538
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:36,721
We have rigged this entire
valley of death with hidden cameras.

539
00:31:38,195 --> 00:31:41,824
And I will be shooting as well,
from unseen vantage points,

540
00:31:41,932 --> 00:31:45,527
so that every glorious moment
is captured on film.

541
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:49,967
And believe me, gentlemen,
it will be glorious.

542
00:31:50,073 --> 00:31:52,598
If it looks real,
chances are it probably is.

543
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:54,301
You wanted to be actors.

544
00:31:54,411 --> 00:31:57,005
You wanted to occupy
the skin of another human being.

545
00:31:57,114 --> 00:32:00,106
Well, get ready to occupy the skin
of a terrified U.S. infantry grunt,

546
00:32:00,217 --> 00:32:03,983
surrounded by death,
crawling up Satan's bottom.

547
00:32:05,022 --> 00:32:09,721
There'll be ambushes, enemy fire,
your own little personal slice of 'nam.

548
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:14,423
This radio goes to the chopper
and the chopper only.

549
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:18,968
The chopper is God,
and I am Jesus Christ, his son.

550
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:21,765
You are my chosen disciples.

551
00:32:21,872 --> 00:32:24,898
And no one gets to go home
till we get the shots.

552
00:32:25,008 --> 00:32:28,034
Put on your war faces, gentlemen.

553
00:32:28,145 --> 00:32:32,844
Now, let's go and make
the greatest war movie ever!

554
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,282
- Yeah!
- All right!

555
00:32:54,037 --> 00:32:55,095
Yeah!

556
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:01,602
Yeah!

557
00:33:14,157 --> 00:33:16,057
Not bad, cockburn!

558
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,089
Not bad.

559
00:33:20,797 --> 00:33:22,389
Wherever you are!

560
00:33:24,401 --> 00:33:27,461
Wherever he is?
Looks like he's all over the place.

561
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,173
Here we go.

562
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,300
Must be an old French mine.

563
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:36,868
It's a remnant from colonial indo-China.
This jungle must be full of them.

564
00:33:38,949 --> 00:33:42,407
Don't you get it?
He's messing with our heads.

565
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:44,544
That's what all that
playing God stuff was about.

566
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:47,215
He's trying to get us to act good,
save the movie.

567
00:33:47,324 --> 00:33:50,350
He ain't playing God.
He's being judged by him.

568
00:33:54,364 --> 00:33:57,060
That's our objective.
Complete the mission.

569
00:34:03,273 --> 00:34:06,174
No offense, kirk,
I know you're the big fancy actor here,

570
00:34:06,276 --> 00:34:10,178
but I've done a lot more effects-driven
event films than you. Okay?

571
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,679
And I think I can spot

572
00:34:13,784 --> 00:34:15,308
a prop head when I see one.

573
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:16,909
Oh, Jesus.

574
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:21,613
It's corn syrup, guys.
Corn syrup and latex.

575
00:34:24,828 --> 00:34:27,956
Warm, blood-flavored corn syrup.

576
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:29,191
Oh, God.

577
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:32,961
Smoke and mirrors, guys.
Welcome to the movie factory.

578
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,264
Oldest trick in the book.

579
00:34:36,273 --> 00:34:37,570
He getting down now.

580
00:34:37,674 --> 00:34:39,039
Oh, my God!

581
00:34:41,845 --> 00:34:43,904
Whoa, look at me!

582
00:34:44,014 --> 00:34:45,481
You're going to get the shots,

583
00:34:45,582 --> 00:34:48,574
and I'm going to make sure
because I'm the director.

584
00:34:48,685 --> 00:34:50,812
I'm from London. I direct plays.

585
00:34:50,921 --> 00:34:53,947
Hey, Damien! We got our war faces on!

586
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:05,662
Look, I'm Dave Beckham.

587
00:35:15,312 --> 00:35:17,712
So, we gotta
light these boys up today, huh?

588
00:35:17,814 --> 00:35:20,009
Blow some sense into these young men.

589
00:35:20,984 --> 00:35:23,885
Hey, I don't want to come off
as weird or anything,

590
00:35:23,987 --> 00:35:27,923
but I might be your biggest fan. Yeah.

591
00:35:29,292 --> 00:35:32,784
Tropic thunder.
Kind of like my catcher in the rye.

592
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:36,261
Yeah, I've never been in the military,
per se,

593
00:35:36,366 --> 00:35:38,800
but I have lost an appendage
in the line of duty.

594
00:35:40,604 --> 00:35:42,834
Driving miss Daisy, first studio gig.

595
00:35:43,607 --> 00:35:44,665
Yeah.

596
00:35:45,175 --> 00:35:47,973
It's a pretty cool sidearm you got there.
What is it?

597
00:35:48,078 --> 00:35:49,739
I don't know what it's called.

598
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:55,614
I just know the sound it makes
when it takes a man's life.

599
00:35:58,755 --> 00:35:59,813
Okay.

600
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,630
Damien, we're go for explosion.

601
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:04,523
Ready to kick the tires
and light the fires on your say-so.

602
00:36:04,628 --> 00:36:06,357
Damien, we're go for explosion.

603
00:36:07,497 --> 00:36:08,521
Do you copy?

604
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:11,499
I got an itchy trigger finger here,
and I'm ready to blow some shit up.

605
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:15,230
All right, you happy now?
Can we do the scene?

606
00:36:15,338 --> 00:36:17,966
Or do you need a formal invitation?
Come on, let's go!

607
00:36:19,776 --> 00:36:20,868
Here. Okay.

608
00:36:20,977 --> 00:36:23,172
"Scene 12, exterior,
jungle clearing, day, ambush.

609
00:36:28,718 --> 00:36:30,652
"Four leaf notices
movement in the brush.

610
00:36:30,754 --> 00:36:33,780
"A dozen guerrilla fighters
can be seen moving in the tree line.

611
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,450
"Somewhere a mine explodes."
And you.

612
00:36:37,794 --> 00:36:39,819
"I got a bad feeling on this one."

613
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,420
- Yeah.
- No, that's your line.

614
00:36:41,531 --> 00:36:44,398
- I got... now?
- Yeah, but scared. Like, scared.

615
00:36:44,501 --> 00:36:47,231
- "I got a bad feeling on this one."
- Dude, wait, like how?

616
00:36:47,337 --> 00:36:49,168
"I got a bad feeling on this one."

617
00:36:49,272 --> 00:36:51,365
- Okay.
- Action. Go, come on.

618
00:37:00,383 --> 00:37:03,250
I got a bad feeling
on this one there, fats.

619
00:37:04,588 --> 00:37:07,989
Our asses don't get fragged
in this bullshit valley,

620
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:09,922
first thing I'm doing
is paying my two bucks

621
00:37:10,026 --> 00:37:11,653
so I can watch Brooklyn bust his cherry

622
00:37:11,761 --> 00:37:14,457
on a sweet little mama-San's
dinky dau poontang.

623
00:37:14,564 --> 00:37:17,465
Shit, Brooklyn be bagged and tagged
before he get any cooch.

624
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:20,798
He die, he probably die
a coochless motherfucker.

625
00:37:20,904 --> 00:37:22,303
Zip it, motown.

626
00:37:22,405 --> 00:37:23,963
Don't you worry, Brooklyn.

627
00:37:24,074 --> 00:37:26,133
You got a lot of days of fucking
ahead of you.

628
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:29,837
Man, I'm thirsty.

629
00:37:30,947 --> 00:37:35,907
Might as well have some of this
Booty sweat I got back in danang.

630
00:37:36,786 --> 00:37:40,278
Yo, asshole! This motherfucker's dead!

631
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,187
Ain't no criss angel mindfreak,

632
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:45,625
David Blaine trapdoor
horseshit jumping off here!

633
00:37:45,729 --> 00:37:49,495
Hey! You wanna get on the train here,
or do you wanna ruin another take?

634
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,932
There ain't no goddamn takes,
ain't no goddamn motion picture!

635
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,667
- You sure?
- Yeah.

636
00:37:55,772 --> 00:37:57,569
- Yeah?
- For certain, man.

637
00:37:57,674 --> 00:37:59,574
Then why are you still in character?

638
00:38:01,144 --> 00:38:03,112
I know, but I don't have to tell you.

639
00:38:04,247 --> 00:38:05,305
You don't know.

640
00:38:05,415 --> 00:38:08,350
Man, I don't drop character
till I done a DVD commentary.

641
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:13,282
You happy now?
We're out of position for the effects!

642
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,119
Get down, fool!

643
00:38:16,826 --> 00:38:19,727
Didn't anyone read the script?
This is the ambush!

644
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:24,794
- This feels pretty real!
- Exactly! Let's use it.

645
00:38:35,412 --> 00:38:36,572
Yeah!

646
00:38:37,847 --> 00:38:39,212
Yeah!

647
00:38:41,818 --> 00:38:43,080
Eat lead!

648
00:38:45,055 --> 00:38:47,421
They're busting caps
like a motherfucker down there.

649
00:38:50,694 --> 00:38:52,787
This is fubar. I say we juice them.

650
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:54,386
- What do you think?
- Juice them.

651
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,291
Fuck you, Charlie!

652
00:39:01,371 --> 00:39:02,838
Big-ass titties!

653
00:39:08,812 --> 00:39:10,439
Look at that, huh?

654
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:16,913
And cut!

655
00:39:19,189 --> 00:39:21,020
That's the trailer right there.

656
00:39:21,124 --> 00:39:22,421
Yeah!

657
00:39:22,525 --> 00:39:24,789
- What do we do now?
- Yeah.

658
00:39:24,894 --> 00:39:26,418
North. Man said to head north.

659
00:39:26,529 --> 00:39:29,862
- Did you see me shooting?
- That's how we do. Good work, baby.

660
00:39:29,966 --> 00:39:31,024
I believed it.

661
00:39:31,134 --> 00:39:32,294
D'ang kwook river.

662
00:39:32,936 --> 00:39:34,335
I'm betting
he's got more of these battles

663
00:39:34,437 --> 00:39:37,167
and viet congs
rigged for us along the way.

664
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:41,040
Sergeant osiris, get your men.
Load and lock.

665
00:39:41,711 --> 00:39:43,474
Real, baby, I'm real.

666
00:39:44,547 --> 00:39:47,345
Let's go! We got a lot of klicks to cover!

667
00:39:48,485 --> 00:39:51,511
Hump it up, gentlemen!
Single formation.

668
00:39:51,621 --> 00:39:53,452
Don't dawdle now!

669
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:21,846
D-rod, d-rod, this is puddingface.
How are we coming on that hotplate?

670
00:40:24,487 --> 00:40:27,786
Something's up.
I think we better drag ass back there.

671
00:40:27,891 --> 00:40:30,587
Make sure Damien ain't forgot
how to use his talkbox again.

672
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:41,304
Yeah, baby, come on. Just a little taste.

673
00:40:42,906 --> 00:40:45,033
- What are you doing, Jeff?
- Fucking... nothing, man!

674
00:40:45,141 --> 00:40:48,474
- I'm eating jellybeans.
- Wow, I love jellybeans. Can I please...

675
00:40:48,578 --> 00:40:51,308
No, you can't have
any fucking jellybeans.

676
00:40:51,414 --> 00:40:52,506
They're mine.

677
00:40:52,615 --> 00:40:53,775
You think
you're the only one who gets sick

678
00:40:53,883 --> 00:40:55,578
when he doesn't have his jellybeans?

679
00:40:55,685 --> 00:40:57,084
Boundaries, man. Fuck.

680
00:41:17,006 --> 00:41:19,702
Hey. I didn't mean to
show you up back there.

681
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:23,939
It's just, I feel like we really need
to set the example for the other guys.

682
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:25,947
It's gonna be tough,

683
00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:29,075
but I think Damien's gonna get
some great shit out of us.

684
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,380
Just wish I had
a director like this on Jack.

685
00:41:32,455 --> 00:41:34,946
On Jack. What? Jack?
What you talking about?

686
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:38,127
- Simple Jack.
- Oh, yeah.

687
00:41:39,629 --> 00:41:42,860
Simple Jack, yeah.
You went all out on that one, huh?

688
00:41:42,966 --> 00:41:45,230
You did.
Really swung for the fences, huh?

689
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:47,735
Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.

690
00:41:47,837 --> 00:41:50,738
Yeah, it was an intense experience,
you know.

691
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:53,534
I just did the work.

692
00:41:53,643 --> 00:41:57,443
Watched a lot of retarded people.
Spent time with them. Observed them.

693
00:41:58,748 --> 00:42:00,909
Watched all the retarded stuff they did.

694
00:42:01,017 --> 00:42:02,780
Then again,
I always found mere observation

695
00:42:02,886 --> 00:42:05,184
in and of itself is a tad rudimentary.

696
00:42:05,288 --> 00:42:08,348
Sometimes, we gotta dig deeper
to mine the true emotional pay dirt.

697
00:42:08,458 --> 00:42:12,792
Thus, we can diagram the source
of the pain and then live it, you know.

698
00:42:12,896 --> 00:42:14,955
Yeah, yeah, live it. Yeah, exactly.

699
00:42:15,064 --> 00:42:17,794
You know, there were times
when I was doing Jack

700
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:20,369
that I actually felt retarded,

701
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:21,835
- like really retarded.
- Oh, yeah.

702
00:42:21,938 --> 00:42:24,133
I mean, I brushed my teeth retarded,

703
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,037
- I rode the bus retarded.
- Damn.

704
00:42:26,142 --> 00:42:29,373
In a weird way,
I had to sort of just free myself up

705
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:32,448
to believe that it was okay
to be stupid or dumb.

706
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:34,107
- To be a moron.
- Yeah.

707
00:42:34,217 --> 00:42:36,947
- To be moronical.
- Exactly, to be a moron.

708
00:42:37,053 --> 00:42:38,418
- An imbecile.
- Yeah.

709
00:42:38,521 --> 00:42:41,388
Like the dumbest motherfucker
that ever lived.

710
00:42:41,491 --> 00:42:42,651
When I was playing the character.

711
00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:45,353
- When you was the character.
- Yeah, as Jack, definitely.

712
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,657
Jack, stupid ass Jack.

713
00:42:47,764 --> 00:42:49,026
Trying to come back from that.

714
00:42:49,132 --> 00:42:53,262
In a weird way it was almost like
I had to sort of fool my mind

715
00:42:53,369 --> 00:42:56,338
into believing that it wasn't retarded,

716
00:42:56,439 --> 00:42:58,240
and by the end of the whole thing,
I was like,

717
00:42:58,274 --> 00:43:02,802
"wait a minute, I flushed so much out,
how am I gonna jumpstart it up again?"

718
00:43:02,912 --> 00:43:04,971
- It's just like... right?
- Yeah.

719
00:43:05,081 --> 00:43:07,845
You was farting in bathtubs
and laughing your ass off.

720
00:43:07,951 --> 00:43:09,816
Yeah.

721
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:12,217
But simple Jack thought he was smart,

722
00:43:12,322 --> 00:43:13,619
or rather, didn't think he was retarded,

723
00:43:13,723 --> 00:43:16,590
so you can't afford to play retarded,
being a smart actor.

724
00:43:16,693 --> 00:43:19,184
Playing a guy who ain't smart
but thinks he is,

725
00:43:19,295 --> 00:43:20,922
- that's tricky.
- Tricky.

726
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:24,557
It's like working with Mercury.
It's high science, man. It's an art form.

727
00:43:24,667 --> 00:43:26,692
- Yeah.
- You an artist.

728
00:43:26,803 --> 00:43:28,600
- That's what we do, right? Yeah.
- Yeah.

729
00:43:28,705 --> 00:43:29,967
Hats off for going there,

730
00:43:30,073 --> 00:43:32,803
especially knowing how
the academy is about that shit.

731
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:40,040
- About what?
- You're serious? You don't know?

732
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:44,277
Everybody knows
you never go full retard.

733
00:43:45,822 --> 00:43:47,915
- What do you mean?
- Check it out.

734
00:43:48,057 --> 00:43:52,153
Dustin Hoffman, rain man, looked
retarded, act retarded, not retarded.

735
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:56,358
Count toothpicks, cheat at cards.
Autistic, sure. Not retarded.

736
00:43:57,233 --> 00:43:59,098
Then you got tom Hanks,
Forrest Gump.

737
00:43:59,202 --> 00:44:01,500
Slow, yes, retarded, maybe,
braces on his legs.

738
00:44:01,604 --> 00:44:04,505
But he charmed the pants off Nixon,
and he won a ping-pong competition.

739
00:44:04,607 --> 00:44:05,631
That ain't retarded.

740
00:44:05,775 --> 00:44:09,711
And he was a goddamn war hero.
You know any retarded war heroes?

741
00:44:11,648 --> 00:44:13,639
You went full retard, man.

742
00:44:15,184 --> 00:44:16,549
Never go full retard.

743
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:21,115
You don't buy that?
Ask Sean penn, 2001, I am Sam.

744
00:44:21,224 --> 00:44:24,523
Remember? Went full retard?
Went home empty-handed.

745
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:37,567
Oh, my God! Holy shit!

746
00:44:38,241 --> 00:44:40,937
Good job, turd. You killed the director.

747
00:44:41,044 --> 00:44:42,306
No, that's impossible, man.

748
00:44:42,412 --> 00:44:45,279
I rigged the whole tree line,
and this is here.

749
00:44:45,415 --> 00:44:46,939
- He must have missed his mark.
- Missed his mark?

750
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:48,278
Yeah, this isn't me.

751
00:44:48,384 --> 00:44:51,182
Come on, let's bag and tag the bastard
and get back to the hotel.

752
00:44:51,287 --> 00:44:53,983
- You're in a world of hurt, dumbo!
- We're in a world of hurt!

753
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,285
- You're in trouble.
- This isn't just on me!

754
00:44:56,392 --> 00:44:58,622
- We're in a... we're together on this.
- Bullshit.

755
00:44:58,728 --> 00:45:00,195
You're just gonna run away.
You're gonna leave.

756
00:45:00,296 --> 00:45:02,056
What happened to,
"no man left behind," okay?

757
00:45:02,065 --> 00:45:04,329
Just wait, just wait! Listen!
Listen, okay?

758
00:45:04,434 --> 00:45:07,164
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Let me just be real with you, all right?

759
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:10,569
I almost blinded Jamie Lee Curtis
on freaky Friday, okay?

760
00:45:10,673 --> 00:45:12,004
This shit will fucking ruin me!

761
00:45:12,108 --> 00:45:14,068
- Just get off me! You're pathetic.
- No, I'm not.

762
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:16,578
- Get off me!
- You are not going back!

763
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:21,883
- What the fuck?
- Now wait a minute.

764
00:45:32,261 --> 00:45:34,957
So, what?
We're just supposed to keep walking?

765
00:45:35,064 --> 00:45:37,931
Try to stay in character.
Remember, we're on camera.

766
00:45:38,067 --> 00:45:39,067
This thing's too heavy.

767
00:45:39,135 --> 00:45:40,568
I want the rubber one
that the prop guy gave me.

768
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:42,934
Where's the fucking prop guy?

769
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:50,504
How's it going with that map, chief?

770
00:45:50,613 --> 00:45:53,207
- Can I have a look at it?
- I got it.

771
00:45:53,316 --> 00:45:54,874
Yeah, Damien gave it to me,
remember?

772
00:45:54,984 --> 00:45:56,474
Yeah, but he gave it to you for us.

773
00:45:56,586 --> 00:45:58,213
- Yeah.
- Okay.

774
00:45:58,321 --> 00:46:00,846
- I got it.
- You got it upside down.

775
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:01,990
Thank you.

776
00:46:02,091 --> 00:46:03,649
Letters go one way
and the numbers another.

777
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,318
Dude, I'm trying to...
I got your back, man.

778
00:46:05,428 --> 00:46:07,191
- Well, I'm cool. All right, I'm cool.
- You are?

779
00:46:07,296 --> 00:46:09,161
Is your character dyslexic?

780
00:46:09,265 --> 00:46:10,994
- No, my character's not dyslexic.
- So you a cartographer.

781
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,931
I'm tired, I want to go home.

782
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:15,596
Why, so you can get back and make
fatties: Fart 20, or some shit?

783
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:18,607
It's fatties: Fart two, there's no... hey,
you wish you had a fatties franchise.

784
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:19,988
- What?
- It's fatties: Fart two.

785
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:21,271
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't want no fatties franchise,

786
00:46:21,377 --> 00:46:23,777
- I got a diamond toilet.
- Your stupid-ass commercials.

787
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,347
You're all fucked up, man,
you look tired.

788
00:46:25,448 --> 00:46:26,574
You look like you bumped your head
or something,

789
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:28,514
so I came over to see
if you're fucking all right, that's all.

790
00:46:28,618 --> 00:46:30,643
- Yeah, why don't you get on point?
- I'm on point right here.

791
00:46:30,753 --> 00:46:31,777
My farts
are fucking more beautiful than...

792
00:46:31,888 --> 00:46:34,448
You still got that shit upside down.

793
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:36,538
The numbers help, man, the numbers...

794
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:38,789
The letters go across the top
and then the numbers.

795
00:46:38,895 --> 00:46:40,453
- Want the map?
- Yeah, I want the fucking map.

796
00:46:40,563 --> 00:46:41,996
Well, you can't have it,
'cause Damien gave it me.

797
00:46:42,098 --> 00:46:45,261
You wish you had my farts,
my farts are fucking music.

798
00:46:45,368 --> 00:46:47,734
All right. That's enough.

799
00:46:49,205 --> 00:46:52,936
Everybody's obviously a little bushed
from all this humping.

800
00:46:53,543 --> 00:46:56,034
So take a chow break. Chow break!

801
00:46:57,847 --> 00:46:59,405
But stay alert.

802
00:46:59,982 --> 00:47:03,474
Remember, Charlie don't care
if you're on break or not.

803
00:47:08,558 --> 00:47:11,493
All right, that's lunch. Coming back
to the same scene afterwards,

804
00:47:11,594 --> 00:47:12,959
"lost in the goddamn jungle."

805
00:47:13,062 --> 00:47:14,062
Captain simple Jack.

806
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:16,031
Fuck you.

807
00:47:24,941 --> 00:47:26,499
I fucking hate movies.

808
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:31,678
This is bullshit.
I don't wanna be in this shitty movie.

809
00:47:41,524 --> 00:47:44,288
No! That's my jellybeans! No!

810
00:47:44,393 --> 00:47:49,057
Kid, grab the bat! Please! Shit!

811
00:47:49,165 --> 00:47:52,430
- Yo, man, I got a bust-a-nut.
- You go to hell! There he is.

812
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:58,807
God damn it! Okay. Where'd he go?

813
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:02,256
You little piece of shit!
I'm gonna fucking rip your wings off!

814
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:07,206
Sanducci. Hold up, man,
keep it on the down-low.

815
00:48:08,618 --> 00:48:10,899
I don't really gotta piss.
I'm trying to talk at you, man.

816
00:48:10,953 --> 00:48:12,580
Bait, I need bait.

817
00:48:13,723 --> 00:48:17,420
You went to boot camp, right?
You can read a map?

818
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:18,755
Yeah, I think so.

819
00:48:18,861 --> 00:48:21,557
I know speedman
got everyone convinced we out here

820
00:48:21,664 --> 00:48:25,464
making planet of the apes on YouTube
or some shit, but I don't buy it.

821
00:48:25,568 --> 00:48:28,036
You wanna step on a real landmine?
You wanna die?

822
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:30,533
You wanna get shot
by a real motherfucker?

823
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,803
- Keep looking ahead, man.
- No, of course not.

824
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:36,371
Trying to get home, man.

825
00:48:36,479 --> 00:48:38,140
Got a big job coming up next year.

826
00:48:38,247 --> 00:48:39,680
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

827
00:48:39,782 --> 00:48:42,307
It's about Abe Lincoln and John wilkes
booth when they were both young.

828
00:48:42,418 --> 00:48:43,510
- Oh, wow!
- Yeah.

829
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:46,110
- That's a classy picture.
- Dude, you kind of look like Abe.

830
00:48:46,222 --> 00:48:47,689
Slap a beard on you.

831
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:49,815
- What's your fucking name?
- Really? It's Kevin.

832
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:51,917
- Kevin sandusky.
- Yeah.

833
00:48:52,595 --> 00:48:56,156
If I can put that map in your hands,
can I count on you?

834
00:48:56,566 --> 00:49:00,093
- Well, yeah, I guess you can.
- Dynamite. I'm out.

835
00:49:03,773 --> 00:49:06,207
That smelled just like bologna
for some reason.

836
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:08,834
Is anyone gonna fucking help me
get this fucking thing?

837
00:49:09,545 --> 00:49:12,105
Why are they even out in the daytime?

838
00:49:14,317 --> 00:49:18,754
I'm gonna level with you, bro.
I don't need to pee. I need to talk to you.

839
00:49:24,994 --> 00:49:28,760
Lazarus is gonna torpedo the movie.

840
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,696
He's way out on a limb
with this character,

841
00:49:32,802 --> 00:49:34,633
and I think he's getting cold feet.

842
00:49:35,938 --> 00:49:38,736
And the men respect you,
'cause you went to boot camp

843
00:49:38,841 --> 00:49:40,468
and rehearsal.

844
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:44,035
- Can I count on you, Kyle.
- It's Kevin.

845
00:49:44,146 --> 00:49:45,204
Good.

846
00:49:46,782 --> 00:49:49,649
If you want
I could give the map a look-see.

847
00:49:49,752 --> 00:49:51,913
- I'll handle the map.
- Okay.

848
00:49:52,021 --> 00:49:55,252
You stick with the program,
we get this movie in the can,

849
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:59,055
I'm thinking there could be
a teen choice award in it for you.

850
00:49:59,161 --> 00:50:03,359
You have that potential.
They'll slime you, the whole deal.

851
00:50:03,466 --> 00:50:07,095
- Yeah, that's wicked.
- Good.

852
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:15,102
There it is! Yeah, now you're dead!

853
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:17,507
You o.D.'D!

854
00:50:19,081 --> 00:50:20,412
Hold up now, Jeff.

855
00:50:22,818 --> 00:50:24,217
Fucking hell!

856
00:50:25,855 --> 00:50:28,915
What the hell, Jeff? That's a bat, man!

857
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:31,493
I don't have any more jellybeans.

858
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,897
You land there!

859
00:50:54,817 --> 00:50:57,217
Wow. Look at these ruins.

860
00:50:59,388 --> 00:51:03,825
- Where the hell are we?
- D'ang kwook river.

861
00:51:03,926 --> 00:51:06,292
That so? How do you know that?
How you sure?

862
00:51:06,395 --> 00:51:08,590
Only one way to find out, dude. Let's go.

863
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:13,795
Yeah. I'm not feeling so good right now.
Seriously, my skin hurts!

864
00:51:13,903 --> 00:51:16,337
Enough from the peanut gallery!
Into the water, ladies!

865
00:51:16,439 --> 00:51:18,507
No, man. Let me take a look at that map
right quick.

866
00:51:18,674 --> 00:51:20,354
Why is everybody
all obsessed with the map?

867
00:51:20,376 --> 00:51:22,401
'Cause we're tired
of being your trail donkeys!

868
00:51:22,511 --> 00:51:24,911
Acting like you some one-man GPS!

869
00:51:25,014 --> 00:51:28,882
God damn it! We lost!
We fucking super lost, man!

870
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:31,112
Tell him, mcclusky.
Tell him what time it is.

871
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:32,778
I don't believe you people.

872
00:51:34,523 --> 00:51:36,218
What do you mean "you people"?

873
00:51:38,894 --> 00:51:41,488
What do you mean, "you people"?

874
00:51:41,597 --> 00:51:43,588
I think what tugg means is...

875
00:51:43,699 --> 00:51:45,064
No, look at his eyes, man.

876
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:47,897
You people, you actors. You people...
- Look at them beady, white devil eyes.

877
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:49,605
I gotta get back to the hotel, for real!

878
00:51:49,638 --> 00:51:51,606
- Hell, no!
- Silence!

879
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:55,303
Chill! All right? Just chill it.

880
00:51:56,812 --> 00:52:00,009
Now, let's go get those viet congs.

881
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:02,408
- "Viet cong"!
- What?

882
00:52:02,918 --> 00:52:05,944
It's "viet cong." There's no "s."
It's already plural.

883
00:52:06,055 --> 00:52:07,647
You wouldn't say "Chineses."

884
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:11,459
All right, that's enough
of this insubordination!

885
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,358
If the machine breaks down,
we break down.

886
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,988
Hey, man, you know how in Rambo I,
he was big but a little puffy

887
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:18,739
and then Rambo ii,
he got all shredded up?

888
00:52:18,801 --> 00:52:21,668
- Yeah.
- That's kind of how you look right now.

889
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:23,329
- Yeah?
- Not Rambo I but ii.

890
00:52:23,439 --> 00:52:25,168
- Really?
- Yeah, when he was cut up.

891
00:52:25,274 --> 00:52:27,640
I'm not that... I mean,
that's what I'm going for, but you know...

892
00:52:27,743 --> 00:52:30,439
Come on, dude. You more shredded
than a julienne salad, man.

893
00:52:30,546 --> 00:52:32,036
- Thanks.
- What's the secret, dude?

894
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:33,513
- It's a diet. I'm just dieting.
- Really?

895
00:52:33,616 --> 00:52:36,608
'Cause I'm trying to come up a little,
but it's just... it's tough.

896
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:38,209
- You look good.
- Any tips?

897
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,015
- What?
- Any tips, you got?

898
00:52:40,122 --> 00:52:41,248
There's, like, the pineapple...

899
00:52:41,357 --> 00:52:43,655
- Give me that goddamn map! Fuck you!
- Hey!

900
00:52:43,759 --> 00:52:45,351
- Hey!
- All right, now!

901
00:52:45,461 --> 00:52:47,895
What it is, sikorski?
Tell us where we really at.

902
00:52:47,997 --> 00:52:49,988
That's fucking bullshit!
It's a chump move.

903
00:52:50,025 --> 00:52:51,959
We just getting a second opinion, doc.

904
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,057
We're going the wrong way!

905
00:52:55,163 --> 00:52:56,255
- Damn!
- Son of a bitch.

906
00:52:56,365 --> 00:53:00,825
God! I think we were
supposed to be doing this,

907
00:53:00,936 --> 00:53:03,837
and instead we did this.

908
00:53:03,939 --> 00:53:07,568
Shit, shit, shit, shitty shit, shit!

909
00:53:07,676 --> 00:53:10,201
Think you can get us back
to that drop zone, boy?

910
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,545
This is not cool!

911
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:16,376
Maybe.

912
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:19,309
This is insane!

913
00:53:20,589 --> 00:53:22,921
Are you really going
to abandon this movie?

914
00:53:23,725 --> 00:53:25,920
We're supposed to be a unit!

915
00:53:26,028 --> 00:53:27,552
Suck my unit!

916
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:30,227
All right, fine.

917
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:35,235
- I'll finish it by myself.
- You go be all you can be, man.

918
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,328
Tugg, you have no idea
where you're going!

919
00:53:37,439 --> 00:53:39,236
Yes, I do!

920
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:43,869
I'm going to, "exterior, rain forest, dusk.

921
00:53:43,979 --> 00:53:48,439
"Smash cut to four leaf, who treks
alone through a frightening jungle."

922
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:50,484
Suck on that unit, kirk!

923
00:54:04,066 --> 00:54:07,058
Come on, men. Let's get home.

924
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,904
Hello, Mr. mantis. You're beautiful.

925
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,114
Now, if you recall that whole hullabaloo

926
00:54:54,216 --> 00:54:55,945
where Hollywood
was split into schisms,

927
00:54:56,051 --> 00:54:59,452
some studios backing blu-ray disc,
others backing hd DVD.

928
00:54:59,554 --> 00:55:00,646
People thought it would come down to

929
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,019
pixel rate or refresh rate,
and they're pretty much the same.

930
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:06,925
What it came down to was
a combination of gamers and porn.

931
00:55:07,028 --> 00:55:08,757
Now, whichever format porno backs

932
00:55:08,864 --> 00:55:12,698
is usually the one
that becomes the most successful.

933
00:55:12,801 --> 00:55:15,793
But, you know, Sony,
every playstation 3 has a blu-ray in it.

934
00:55:15,904 --> 00:55:17,633
You talking to me this whole time?

935
00:55:18,373 --> 00:55:19,670
I was talking to whoever
was listening to me.

936
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:21,241
Jesus Christ, man!

937
00:55:39,661 --> 00:55:41,720
Booty sweat.

938
00:55:47,769 --> 00:55:49,168
Oh, God!

939
00:55:51,406 --> 00:55:55,968
It's cold! It's freezing. I'm fucking cold.

940
00:55:56,077 --> 00:55:58,272
You want my flak jacket?

941
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:02,248
What, are you insane? It's boiling!
It's like a sweat lodge out here!

942
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:05,183
Keep the volume down on that bitching,
flatch Adams.

943
00:56:05,287 --> 00:56:07,187
I gotta take a fucking 12-pound shit!

944
00:56:07,289 --> 00:56:09,257
- How we doing? We making good time?
- We're making good time,

945
00:56:09,357 --> 00:56:12,485
but there's no way we make it
over that Ridge before sundown.

946
00:56:12,594 --> 00:56:15,085
All right, fellas,
we're gonna make camp, rest up!

947
00:56:15,197 --> 00:56:17,495
- Oh, God.
- Y'all might be in for a treat.

948
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:18,998
You know,
back before the war broked out,

949
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:21,830
I was a saucier in San antone.

950
00:56:21,937 --> 00:56:24,565
I bet I could collar up
some of them Greens.

951
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:28,973
Yeah, noodle some crawfish
out the paddy, yo.

952
00:56:29,077 --> 00:56:33,104
And maybe some crab apples
for dessert, now, you hear? Hell, yeah!

953
00:56:34,449 --> 00:56:35,711
Hell, yeah!

954
00:56:35,817 --> 00:56:40,015
That's how we all talk.
We all talk like this, suh! Yes, suh.

955
00:56:40,121 --> 00:56:45,354
Yeah, get some crawfish and some ribs.

956
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:50,329
You're Australian! Be Australian!
Excuse me, kangaroo Jack.

957
00:56:54,569 --> 00:56:56,969
I get excited about my foods, man.

958
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:25,024
Die!

959
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:41,033
No!

960
00:58:47,582 --> 00:58:51,882
Dude, dude, what the hell
is going on here? Where are we?

961
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:54,386
I have no idea.

962
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:57,049
I've never been outside the states.

963
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:59,319
Wait, what?
Are you fucking kidding me?

964
00:58:59,427 --> 00:59:01,418
Did you make this
whole goddamn thing up?

965
00:59:01,529 --> 00:59:02,894
Dude, were you
even in the fucking service?

966
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:05,659
Yes. Of course. Coast guard.

967
00:59:05,767 --> 00:59:07,667
- Coast guard.
- Sanitation department.

968
00:59:07,769 --> 00:59:10,465
Oh, my God!
You're a fucking garbage man!

969
00:59:10,572 --> 00:59:14,303
Damn it. F.L. Tayback lies to me
and the whole goddamn U.S. of a.

970
00:59:14,409 --> 00:59:17,071
I wrote the book as a tribute!
I'm a patriot!

971
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:19,237
Yeah, you're the milli vanilli
of patriots, okay?

972
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,042
You lied
about fighting the Vietnam war.

973
00:59:21,149 --> 00:59:24,414
It's like punching the American flag
in the face, God damn it.

974
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:25,959
God, and to think I believed in you!

975
00:59:26,054 --> 00:59:28,420
- I don't wanna be next to you.
- Writers lie all the time.

976
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,650
Can I be tied to another post? Okay.

977
00:59:51,968 --> 00:59:53,799
- Rick?
- Tugg.

978
00:59:53,903 --> 00:59:55,962
I killed one, Rick.

979
00:59:57,106 --> 00:59:59,506
The thing I love most in the world.

980
00:59:59,608 --> 01:00:01,439
Vivica, get off the line now!

981
01:00:03,746 --> 01:00:06,146
A hooker. All right, you killed a hooker.

982
01:00:06,248 --> 01:00:08,307
Calm down.
Here's what you're gonna do.

983
01:00:08,417 --> 01:00:09,617
Get your hands on some bleach,

984
01:00:09,685 --> 01:00:12,051
some hydrogen peroxide
and a shitload of lime.

985
01:00:12,154 --> 01:00:13,644
No, a panda.

986
01:00:13,756 --> 01:00:15,519
I killed a panda.

987
01:00:15,624 --> 01:00:17,421
Amanda? Come on, dude.

988
01:00:17,526 --> 01:00:19,551
I mean,
that's probably not even her real name.

989
01:00:19,662 --> 01:00:21,323
No, a panda!

990
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:22,795
A panda?

991
01:00:22,898 --> 01:00:27,535
A sweet, cuddly,
vicious little panda.

992
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:30,605
Jesus Christ, tugg!
Man, don't scare me like that!

993
01:00:30,706 --> 01:00:31,866
It's beautiful here.

994
01:00:31,974 --> 01:00:33,464
You on the set?

995
01:00:33,576 --> 01:00:34,838
I am the set.

996
01:00:34,944 --> 01:00:37,913
All right, man.
Hey, how's the TiVo working out?

997
01:00:38,014 --> 01:00:39,242
Screw TiVo.

998
01:00:39,348 --> 01:00:41,816
I'm way beyond TiVo.

999
01:00:41,917 --> 01:00:44,010
Last I checked,
they hadn't hooked it up, though.

1000
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:47,419
Hadn't hooked it up? No TiVo?

1001
01:00:47,523 --> 01:00:49,354
It doesn't matter anymore.

1002
01:00:52,194 --> 01:00:53,661
I've moved on.

1003
01:00:54,397 --> 01:00:56,126
Where have you moved on to?

1004
01:00:56,232 --> 01:00:57,722
Another agency?

1005
01:00:59,268 --> 01:01:00,792
Who's with you?

1006
01:01:00,903 --> 01:01:03,064
It's Nick Stevens, isn't it?
That little fucker.

1007
01:01:03,172 --> 01:01:07,268
You are still my client, tugg speedman!
I am getting the TiVo!

1008
01:01:07,376 --> 01:01:09,571
Jacket's on, I'm out the door!

1009
01:01:09,678 --> 01:01:10,736
Tugg?

1010
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:15,347
Please don't fire me.

1011
01:01:16,218 --> 01:01:17,412
I did it, I did it!

1012
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,852
Vivica, what do I have scheduled
this afternoon?

1013
01:01:19,955 --> 01:01:22,822
- Two and a half men taping.
- Shit.

1014
01:01:23,826 --> 01:01:24,850
Cancel it.

1015
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,621
And get me tugg's tropic thunder
contract.

1016
01:01:26,729 --> 01:01:29,857
I'm going to Grossman's office,
I'm playing the card.

1017
01:01:29,965 --> 01:01:30,965
Okay.

1018
01:01:34,537 --> 01:01:37,438
Oh, mama. Thirsty.

1019
01:01:37,573 --> 01:01:39,632
He doesn't look too good.

1020
01:01:39,742 --> 01:01:44,770
Must drink,
so I can throw something up!

1021
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,007
No, no. Don't drink that water!
That water's like a petri dish!

1022
01:01:47,116 --> 01:01:48,208
No, don't!

1023
01:01:48,317 --> 01:01:50,842
Alpa, do you have any Booty sweat?

1024
01:01:50,953 --> 01:01:53,319
Yeah, get him chugging on
some of alpa's ass water.

1025
01:01:53,422 --> 01:01:55,356
That'll bring him around. It's a cure-all.

1026
01:01:55,458 --> 01:01:57,358
Man, what you coming out
in movies for anyway?

1027
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:59,121
Did you need another revenue stream?

1028
01:01:59,228 --> 01:02:02,026
For your information,
my revenue stream

1029
01:02:02,131 --> 01:02:04,463
currently generates $2 million a year

1030
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:06,501
in charitable contributions
for my community.

1031
01:02:06,602 --> 01:02:08,934
- Hot damn.
- And why am I in this movie?

1032
01:02:09,038 --> 01:02:11,370
Maybe I just knew I had to represent,

1033
01:02:11,474 --> 01:02:13,271
because they had one good part
in it for a black man

1034
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:15,434
and they gave it to crocodile dundee.

1035
01:02:17,046 --> 01:02:20,607
Pump your brakes, kid.
That man is a national treasure.

1036
01:02:20,716 --> 01:02:22,843
I just wanted to throw another shrimp
on your Barbie.

1037
01:02:22,952 --> 01:02:24,078
That shit ain't funny.

1038
01:02:24,186 --> 01:02:26,882
Hey, fellas! It's hot!
We're tired! It stinks!

1039
01:02:26,989 --> 01:02:28,590
I'm just fucking with you,
kangaroo Jack!

1040
01:02:28,657 --> 01:02:30,386
I'm sorry a dingo ate your baby.

1041
01:02:30,493 --> 01:02:32,961
You know that's a true story?
Lady lost her kid.

1042
01:02:33,062 --> 01:02:35,724
- You about to cross some fucking lines.
- Guys, relax and stuff.

1043
01:02:35,831 --> 01:02:36,889
You know what? Fuck that, man!

1044
01:02:36,999 --> 01:02:39,661
I'm sick of this koala-hugging nigger
telling me...

1045
01:02:44,406 --> 01:02:45,964
For 400 years,

1046
01:02:47,009 --> 01:02:49,910
that word has kept us down.

1047
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,607
What the fuck?

1048
01:02:52,715 --> 01:02:56,481
It took a whole lot of trying
just to get up that hill.

1049
01:02:56,585 --> 01:02:59,486
Now we up in the big leagues,

1050
01:02:59,588 --> 01:03:01,351
getting our turn at bat.

1051
01:03:01,457 --> 01:03:04,119
Long as we live, it's you and me, baby.

1052
01:03:04,793 --> 01:03:08,126
That's the theme song for
the jeffersons. You really need help.

1053
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:11,358
Yeah. Just 'cause it's the theme song,
don't make it not true.

1054
01:03:11,467 --> 01:03:13,401
You know what?
I'm gonna tell you what's true.

1055
01:03:13,502 --> 01:03:16,938
I'm gonna tag you back.
You better believe that, baby.

1056
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:19,633
Guys! Hey, guys!

1057
01:03:20,242 --> 01:03:22,710
Jeff, stay away from that animal.

1058
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,913
I'm gonna bite his hide. I need...

1059
01:03:28,951 --> 01:03:32,216
I need to wear his stomach skin
like a unitard.

1060
01:03:33,189 --> 01:03:36,488
Ain't nobody doing nothing
to no one or body!

1061
01:03:36,592 --> 01:03:41,461
Now, if Mr. portnoy is feeling
a little flu-ish, don't wanna walk,

1062
01:03:41,564 --> 01:03:43,623
put him up on that cloven-hoof animal!

1063
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,297
We got ground to cover!

1064
01:04:15,297 --> 01:04:18,562
All right, pow camp, scene 67.

1065
01:04:19,468 --> 01:04:21,197
Bring it on, cockburn!

1066
01:04:29,278 --> 01:04:31,712
Maybe he's not, you know,
Ridley Scott or something,

1067
01:04:31,814 --> 01:04:33,611
but I think renny harlin's
a tremendous filmmaker

1068
01:04:33,716 --> 01:04:36,514
like, adventures of Ford fairlane,
you know,

1069
01:04:36,619 --> 01:04:40,248
as far as an Andrew Dice Clay
vehicle goes, it's pretty decent.

1070
01:04:40,356 --> 01:04:42,790
And cliffhanger.
Cliffhanger's incredible.

1071
01:04:42,891 --> 01:04:46,349
As far as the whole like,
man against nature type of movies go,

1072
01:04:46,462 --> 01:04:48,623
it's absolutely amazing.

1073
01:04:48,731 --> 01:04:50,631
Shut the fuck up!

1074
01:04:55,271 --> 01:04:56,932
Who send you here?

1075
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:01,669
Tayback, John, sergeant,
United States army.

1076
01:05:02,411 --> 01:05:07,815
Serial number 694529987.

1077
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:14,612
Perhaps some hot tea
will make conversing

1078
01:05:14,723 --> 01:05:16,486
a little easier.

1079
01:05:20,262 --> 01:05:22,355
My leader's not quite as cordial.

1080
01:05:25,834 --> 01:05:28,701
Look, what? I just thought you might
like some hot tea

1081
01:05:28,804 --> 01:05:32,331
- in order to calm your nerves.
- Tayback, John, sergeant,

1082
01:05:32,474 --> 01:05:37,434
United States army, 694529987.

1083
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:43,809
And here's a little message
from my Uncle Sam.

1084
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:51,824
Dude, you all right?

1085
01:05:51,927 --> 01:05:53,360
Man you totally leaned into that.

1086
01:05:53,462 --> 01:05:56,522
I was pulling it back
and you just came in too...

1087
01:05:56,632 --> 01:05:58,827
Hey, it was an accident, man.

1088
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:03,304
Come on, good.
You want to keep going?

1089
01:06:03,405 --> 01:06:04,997
- Let's go.
- Get up.

1090
01:06:05,107 --> 01:06:06,699
I rather rot in your v.C. Jail!

1091
01:06:06,809 --> 01:06:10,677
I'll never bend to your will!
You scum! You scum!

1092
01:06:10,779 --> 01:06:12,804
Now say this
and go to the beginning again,

1093
01:06:12,915 --> 01:06:14,678
let's do the tea part, okay?

1094
01:06:16,218 --> 01:06:17,651
Dude, I hope you're not pissed.

1095
01:06:17,986 --> 01:06:19,783
I see moss on both sides of that tree.

1096
01:06:19,888 --> 01:06:23,016
Well, you know, maybe if I wasn't
the only one at boot camp...

1097
01:06:23,125 --> 01:06:25,025
My belly really hurts, you guys!

1098
01:06:25,127 --> 01:06:27,322
I'm not joking around, I'm nauseous.

1099
01:06:27,429 --> 01:06:29,670
Let me off, I gotta puke!
I don't wanna die like hendrix!

1100
01:06:29,765 --> 01:06:31,426
All right. All right.

1101
01:06:36,004 --> 01:06:37,995
Are you okay, Jeff?

1102
01:06:38,107 --> 01:06:39,472
I'm awesome.

1103
01:06:41,877 --> 01:06:43,344
Holy shit!

1104
01:06:47,883 --> 01:06:50,044
Okay. Everyone, down, down, down.

1105
01:06:54,757 --> 01:06:56,247
Man. Now I'm tripping.

1106
01:06:56,358 --> 01:06:58,986
That looks like the pow camp
from out the script, yo.

1107
01:06:59,862 --> 01:07:01,557
Speedman was right?

1108
01:07:01,663 --> 01:07:03,028
I don't think so.

1109
01:07:03,132 --> 01:07:05,362
Look at the cooking vats,
the armed guards.

1110
01:07:06,969 --> 01:07:09,062
Looks like a heroin processing plant.

1111
01:07:10,172 --> 01:07:11,298
We were in that chopper for hours.

1112
01:07:11,407 --> 01:07:13,671
I don't even think
we're in Vietnam anymore.

1113
01:07:13,776 --> 01:07:16,210
- Fuck.
- Shit. We ain't even in 'nam?

1114
01:07:16,311 --> 01:07:19,075
No, most likely Myanmar or Laos.

1115
01:07:19,181 --> 01:07:20,739
What the fuck is Laos?

1116
01:07:20,849 --> 01:07:22,009
It's the golden triangle.

1117
01:07:22,117 --> 01:07:24,085
Oh, fuck. We're dead.

1118
01:07:24,186 --> 01:07:26,154
No one gets out of here. I saw it on TV.

1119
01:07:26,255 --> 01:07:30,282
Fucking boats, airplanes,
ufos and shit, they all just vanish!

1120
01:07:30,392 --> 01:07:32,917
Yo, that's the Bermuda triangle,
dumbass.

1121
01:07:33,028 --> 01:07:35,394
This is the golden triangle.

1122
01:07:35,497 --> 01:07:37,098
It's the world's hard drug superhighway.

1123
01:07:37,166 --> 01:07:38,463
How do you know that?

1124
01:07:38,567 --> 01:07:41,297
It was a really long trip.
I read the in-flight magazine.

1125
01:07:43,105 --> 01:07:44,402
Cut!

1126
01:07:44,506 --> 01:07:45,973
Oh, Jesus!

1127
01:07:46,074 --> 01:07:48,565
What do you see, man? I'm blocked.

1128
01:07:48,677 --> 01:07:50,042
Damien, cut!

1129
01:07:51,814 --> 01:07:53,406
Hey, Damien, cut!

1130
01:07:54,249 --> 01:07:55,910
They got speedman.

1131
01:07:56,485 --> 01:07:57,918
And it doesn't look good.

1132
01:08:30,586 --> 01:08:31,883
I am tran.

1133
01:08:32,855 --> 01:08:35,016
You are a trespasser in my poppy fields.

1134
01:08:36,425 --> 01:08:39,053
You are d.E.A. Scum!

1135
01:08:40,996 --> 01:08:44,432
Were there some re-writes
that I missed?

1136
01:08:50,739 --> 01:08:52,229
Do you want to die?

1137
01:08:53,008 --> 01:08:54,475
- Do you?
- No!

1138
01:08:54,576 --> 01:08:58,706
Please, don't hurt me!

1139
01:09:06,588 --> 01:09:07,782
Say that again.

1140
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:10,587
Please, don't hurt me.

1141
01:09:10,692 --> 01:09:13,786
No! Like you did before! Say it!

1142
01:09:14,763 --> 01:09:15,763
Say it!

1143
01:09:15,864 --> 01:09:19,857
Please, don't hurt me!

1144
01:09:35,484 --> 01:09:38,078
- What?
- You are simple Jack.

1145
01:09:41,056 --> 01:09:42,921
You saw simple Jack?

1146
01:09:43,025 --> 01:09:45,357
We love the tale of this man,
simple Jack.

1147
01:09:47,062 --> 01:09:48,893
We do not have many luxury here.

1148
01:09:48,997 --> 01:09:51,431
And simple Jack is the only movie
we possess.

1149
01:09:51,533 --> 01:09:55,367
You got the vhs.

1150
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:57,529
We've watched it many, many times.

1151
01:09:57,639 --> 01:10:00,107
You should've got Oscar.

1152
01:10:03,145 --> 01:10:04,908
Well, you know. It's...

1153
01:10:06,181 --> 01:10:08,777
Just to be nominated...
You were nominated?

1154
01:10:08,884 --> 01:10:10,408
No, no, no. I wasn't nominated.

1155
01:10:10,519 --> 01:10:13,682
I'm just saying that to have been
nominated would have been nice.

1156
01:10:13,789 --> 01:10:16,189
It's just... it's very political.
You have to take out ads...

1157
01:10:16,258 --> 01:10:18,749
- Shut up now!
- Okay. Okay.

1158
01:10:19,595 --> 01:10:21,324
So, are you going to

1159
01:10:22,965 --> 01:10:24,592
let me go, or...

1160
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:26,827
No. We'll hold you for ransom.

1161
01:10:26,935 --> 01:10:28,732
Much more money now!

1162
01:10:40,315 --> 01:10:41,315
He's in a meeting.

1163
01:10:41,416 --> 01:10:44,180
Yeah, I know.
In about two seconds with the pecker.

1164
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:47,085
I'm gonna rip your fucking tits off.

1165
01:10:47,189 --> 01:10:49,851
You wanna talk about trouble?
That's trouble.

1166
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:51,516
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1167
01:10:53,428 --> 01:10:55,328
What do you need, peck?

1168
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:58,058
No, more like what do you need, les?

1169
01:10:58,166 --> 01:10:59,360
Glasses?

1170
01:11:00,435 --> 01:11:01,493
What?

1171
01:11:01,603 --> 01:11:04,094
So you can read
the tropic thunder contract

1172
01:11:04,206 --> 01:11:06,606
that guarantees my client,
tugg speedman,

1173
01:11:06,708 --> 01:11:10,439
some form of digital video recorder
on location.

1174
01:11:11,213 --> 01:11:13,340
- Huh?
- I can't believe you let him in.

1175
01:11:14,983 --> 01:11:17,816
Look, fuckstick, I'm incredibly busy,
so why don't you get the hell out of here

1176
01:11:17,919 --> 01:11:20,979
before I snap your dick off
and jam it into your ass?

1177
01:11:21,089 --> 01:11:23,114
No, not you, Helen.

1178
01:11:23,225 --> 01:11:26,922
But I will rip your tits off
if you don't get me those theaters.

1179
01:11:27,029 --> 01:11:28,553
Perfect.

1180
01:11:28,664 --> 01:11:31,098
Hey, tuggernuts,
I've got you on speakerphone.

1181
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:33,064
I'm standing here with les Grossman,

1182
01:11:33,168 --> 01:11:36,331
and he is dying to tell you
why he's apparently wiped his ass

1183
01:11:36,438 --> 01:11:38,736
with the TiVo clause from your contract.

1184
01:11:39,941 --> 01:11:41,932
We are flaming dragon.

1185
01:11:42,044 --> 01:11:44,410
Speedman is with us now.

1186
01:11:44,513 --> 01:11:48,074
For 50 million, you will get him back.

1187
01:11:48,183 --> 01:11:50,344
- Are you gonna get those...
- Who is this?

1188
01:11:50,452 --> 01:11:53,148
- And how did you get this phone?
- We are flaming dragon!

1189
01:11:53,255 --> 01:11:55,155
Simple Jack belong to us now.

1190
01:11:57,893 --> 01:11:59,918
He does, does he?

1191
01:12:00,028 --> 01:12:02,496
Let me tell you something, shitbird.

1192
01:12:02,597 --> 01:12:05,031
I've never even heard
of your little agency.

1193
01:12:05,133 --> 01:12:07,101
But if you think
you can poach my client...

1194
01:12:07,202 --> 01:12:11,730
Send $50 million, or you no see
simple Jack again because we kill him.

1195
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,330
This is les Grossman. Who is this?

1196
01:12:13,442 --> 01:12:15,740
This is flaming dragon!

1197
01:12:15,844 --> 01:12:18,608
Okay. Flaming dragon. Fuckface.

1198
01:12:18,714 --> 01:12:23,549
First, take a big step back
and literally fuck your own face!

1199
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:27,650
Now, I don't know what kind of
pan-pacific bullshit power play

1200
01:12:27,756 --> 01:12:30,224
you're trying to pull here,
but Asia, Jack, is my territory.

1201
01:12:30,325 --> 01:12:31,622
So whatever you're thinking,
you better think again.

1202
01:12:31,727 --> 01:12:33,092
Otherwise, I'm gonna
have to head down there,

1203
01:12:33,195 --> 01:12:36,562
and I will rain down an ungodly
fucking firestorm upon you.

1204
01:12:36,665 --> 01:12:38,292
You're gonna have to call
the fucking united nations

1205
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:42,427
and get a fucking binding resolution
to keep me from fucking destroying you.

1206
01:12:42,537 --> 01:12:45,131
I am talking scorched earth,
motherfucker!

1207
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,003
I will massacre you!

1208
01:12:47,109 --> 01:12:49,043
I will fuck you up!

1209
01:12:56,852 --> 01:12:58,892
- Could you find out who that was? Go.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1210
01:13:34,022 --> 01:13:37,014
You wear these.
More like simple Jack teeth.

1211
01:13:37,125 --> 01:13:38,854
Okay.

1212
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,622
Hey. Look, I know you're a big fan,
and that's great...

1213
01:13:44,699 --> 01:13:46,326
Put teeth in!

1214
01:13:53,441 --> 01:13:55,306
Now do movie.

1215
01:13:55,410 --> 01:13:57,071
The whole movie?

1216
01:13:57,179 --> 01:13:58,840
I can't. I don't know the whole...

1217
01:13:58,947 --> 01:14:01,438
You perform! You perform or die!

1218
01:14:02,184 --> 01:14:03,674
Monkey swine!

1219
01:14:06,588 --> 01:14:07,987
Pa.

1220
01:14:09,958 --> 01:14:11,323
More stupid!

1221
01:14:13,094 --> 01:14:18,157
Pa, why you gotta make me feel bad?

1222
01:14:20,602 --> 01:14:21,933
You saw what I saw.

1223
01:14:22,037 --> 01:14:24,631
Tugg speedman is dead meat
if we don't do something soon.

1224
01:14:24,739 --> 01:14:27,105
Yeah. We could do something
by getting our asses back to the hotel,

1225
01:14:27,209 --> 01:14:28,540
which is in the other direction!

1226
01:14:28,643 --> 01:14:30,235
Ain't right.

1227
01:14:30,345 --> 01:14:32,370
What would've happened
in the great escape

1228
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:36,314
if Steve McQueen and them dudes
had turned tail and ran?

1229
01:14:36,418 --> 01:14:40,411
Well, that's what that movie was about.
They were escaping. They ran away.

1230
01:14:40,522 --> 01:14:43,150
I'm trying to agree with you.
The point is they did something.

1231
01:14:43,258 --> 01:14:44,452
Then what are we supposed to do, huh?

1232
01:14:44,559 --> 01:14:48,461
'Cause he's cleaning a gun
with no bullets. Yeah, that's a plan.

1233
01:14:48,563 --> 01:14:52,693
I'm just like a little boy,
playing with his dick when he's nervous.

1234
01:14:55,904 --> 01:14:58,395
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1235
01:14:58,506 --> 01:15:01,566
I got an idea.
This might be a little crazy.

1236
01:15:01,676 --> 01:15:03,644
Crazy's better than nothing.

1237
01:15:03,745 --> 01:15:07,704
Back in '98, I did a low-budget
titty comedy for skinemax.

1238
01:15:07,816 --> 01:15:11,149
- Sex camp. Remember it?
- Yeah.

1239
01:15:11,253 --> 01:15:15,212
Anyway, me and the campers
from the uncool camp

1240
01:15:15,323 --> 01:15:17,848
had to break into the rich girl camp.

1241
01:15:17,959 --> 01:15:19,654
So, what we did,

1242
01:15:19,761 --> 01:15:22,753
we built a catapult
out of logs and underwear,

1243
01:15:22,864 --> 01:15:26,425
and they shot us over the wall,
and we parachuted down.

1244
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:35,567
Look, you guys, we
already know the plan.

1245
01:15:35,677 --> 01:15:37,645
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm giving you gold.

1246
01:15:37,746 --> 01:15:42,115
We do it just like in the book,
chapter 26, the wet offensive.

1247
01:15:42,217 --> 01:15:44,617
The book of tropic thunder.

1248
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:46,949
Yeah, did you guys read the book?

1249
01:15:48,256 --> 01:15:50,884
The flap, I read the back flap
and saw the pictures.

1250
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:54,788
Well, it's okay.
It's exactly the same as in the script.

1251
01:15:54,896 --> 01:15:55,954
Cool.

1252
01:15:57,933 --> 01:16:00,493
You guys all read the script, right?

1253
01:16:00,602 --> 01:16:02,695
I don't read the script, script reads me.

1254
01:16:03,872 --> 01:16:05,339
What the hell does that even mean?

1255
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,807
What you getting at with the books,
scripts? Spit that shit out, man!

1256
01:16:12,147 --> 01:16:13,978
All right. The wet offensive.

1257
01:16:15,016 --> 01:16:17,918
Osiris and fats go undercover
as a diversion.

1258
01:16:18,019 --> 01:16:20,351
Motown and Brooklyn sneak in
via the river.

1259
01:16:20,455 --> 01:16:22,855
Yeah. But those dudes
was trained soldiers.

1260
01:16:24,726 --> 01:16:25,784
Yeah!

1261
01:16:26,861 --> 01:16:29,853
And we trained actors, motherfucker.

1262
01:16:29,965 --> 01:16:34,299
Time to man up.
And I ain't gonna sugarcoat.

1263
01:16:34,402 --> 01:16:37,166
Some of us
might not even make it back.

1264
01:16:37,272 --> 01:16:40,366
What do you mean?
Like not on the same flight?

1265
01:16:43,078 --> 01:16:45,842
Alpa and I's already wearing
earth mama's natural night camo.

1266
01:16:45,947 --> 01:16:47,778
- Cool it, Benson.
- Sorry.

1267
01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:53,378
We gonna scout, get a plan together.
We ain't back in 20, come looking.

1268
01:16:54,889 --> 01:16:56,754
We are flaming dragon.

1269
01:17:00,495 --> 01:17:01,689
Okay.

1270
01:17:02,998 --> 01:17:06,092
Flaming dragon's
a heroin manufacturer.

1271
01:17:06,201 --> 01:17:09,295
They're responsible
for an eighth of the drug trade in Asia.

1272
01:17:09,404 --> 01:17:12,635
- Huge profit margin.
- Guys!

1273
01:17:12,741 --> 01:17:15,676
Would somebody please let me know
what the game plan is?

1274
01:17:15,777 --> 01:17:17,506
Peck! We have it handled.

1275
01:17:17,612 --> 01:17:20,103
Please, don't interrupt.
Everything's under control.

1276
01:17:20,215 --> 01:17:22,206
I got it. Got it.

1277
01:17:34,329 --> 01:17:36,559
- Les Grossman.
- We not get money yet.

1278
01:17:37,098 --> 01:17:39,225
Price now 100 million!

1279
01:17:39,334 --> 01:17:42,167
You pay now,
or tomorrow simple Jack die.

1280
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:45,330
Great. Let me get this down.

1281
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:46,873
100 million.

1282
01:17:46,975 --> 01:17:49,443
Wait! I got a better idea.

1283
01:17:50,245 --> 01:17:52,076
Instead of 100 million,

1284
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:55,047
how about I send you
a hobo's dick cheese?

1285
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:57,470
Then you kill him! Do your thing!
Skin the fucking bastard!

1286
01:17:57,552 --> 01:17:59,747
Go to town, man! Go to town!

1287
01:17:59,854 --> 01:18:02,015
- No...
- In the meantime, and as usual,

1288
01:18:02,123 --> 01:18:03,784
go fuck yourself!

1289
01:18:04,893 --> 01:18:07,453
- No.
- We don't negotiate with terrorists.

1290
01:18:09,564 --> 01:18:12,294
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, are you insane?

1291
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,231
- I think I could've done that better.
- I thought it was good.

1292
01:18:14,335 --> 01:18:16,200
They're gonna kill him!

1293
01:18:19,274 --> 01:18:20,332
And?

1294
01:18:22,677 --> 01:18:23,803
"And?"

1295
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:29,207
It's a cold, hard world. Shit happens.

1296
01:18:31,519 --> 01:18:34,716
We'll weep for him, in the press.

1297
01:18:34,856 --> 01:18:37,518
Set up a scholarship in his name.

1298
01:18:37,625 --> 01:18:41,561
Eventually, and I'm talking way,
way down the road,

1299
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:43,153
we file an insurance claim.

1300
01:18:43,264 --> 01:18:46,062
Preferably before
the end of the fiscal year.

1301
01:18:46,167 --> 01:18:49,898
Actually, the claim alone would net us
more than the movie would lose.

1302
01:18:52,006 --> 01:18:53,769
You can't be serious.

1303
01:18:55,009 --> 01:18:56,567
You kick in the door to my house,

1304
01:18:56,678 --> 01:19:02,139
all ants in your pants,
sucking my left nut to get a TiVo scrap

1305
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:06,846
for the third runner-up
sexiest man alive 1998,

1306
01:19:06,955 --> 01:19:09,321
and you're asking if I'm serious?

1307
01:19:13,194 --> 01:19:14,889
Let's face it.

1308
01:19:14,996 --> 01:19:19,023
The kids aren't dressing up as scorcher
for purim anymore.

1309
01:19:20,435 --> 01:19:23,427
Speedman is a dying star,

1310
01:19:23,538 --> 01:19:26,769
a white dwarf heading for a black hole.

1311
01:19:26,875 --> 01:19:29,605
That's physics. It's inevitable.

1312
01:19:29,711 --> 01:19:33,044
We've been handed
an incredible opportunity here, peck.

1313
01:19:33,148 --> 01:19:36,982
The universe is talking to us right now.

1314
01:19:37,085 --> 01:19:38,643
You just gotta listen.

1315
01:19:51,766 --> 01:19:55,361
See, this is the good part, pecker.
This is when the job gets fun.

1316
01:19:55,470 --> 01:19:56,562
Yeah.

1317
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:59,834
Ask and you shall receive.

1318
01:20:00,875 --> 01:20:05,005
- All right.
- You play ball, we play ball.

1319
01:20:05,113 --> 01:20:08,480
I know you want the goodies.

1320
01:20:08,583 --> 01:20:10,574
Welcome to the goody room.

1321
01:20:10,685 --> 01:20:15,315
You paying attention?
'Cause I'm talking g5 for the pecker.

1322
01:20:15,423 --> 01:20:16,685
That's how you're gonna roll.

1323
01:20:16,791 --> 01:20:20,750
No more frequent flier
bitch Miles for my boy.

1324
01:20:20,862 --> 01:20:22,159
Yeah!

1325
01:20:22,664 --> 01:20:23,926
Playa.

1326
01:20:24,799 --> 01:20:26,130
Playa!

1327
01:20:27,168 --> 01:20:28,465
Big dick playa.

1328
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:30,561
Swinging past your knees!

1329
01:20:30,672 --> 01:20:31,696
Big dick, baby.

1330
01:20:31,806 --> 01:20:33,000
Yep.

1331
01:20:36,344 --> 01:20:38,938
Or you can grow a conscience

1332
01:20:39,047 --> 01:20:41,413
in the next five minutes
and see where that takes you.

1333
01:20:46,387 --> 01:20:48,480
Let me get this straight.

1334
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:52,219
You want me
to let my client of 15 years,

1335
01:20:52,327 --> 01:20:53,692
one of my best friends,

1336
01:20:53,795 --> 01:20:58,425
die in the jungle, alone,
for some money and a g5?

1337
01:20:59,567 --> 01:21:00,693
Yes.

1338
01:21:05,773 --> 01:21:08,037
A g5 airplane?

1339
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:11,202
Yes.

1340
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,976
And lots of money.

1341
01:21:16,351 --> 01:21:18,512
Playa.

1342
01:21:21,422 --> 01:21:22,616
Yeah!

1343
01:21:23,858 --> 01:21:26,452
Smack it up, flip it, rub it down!

1344
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:31,692
But mama take care of Jack a lot.

1345
01:21:32,533 --> 01:21:36,264
How many more sleeps
before she wakes up again?

1346
01:21:36,371 --> 01:21:37,895
Sorry, Jack.

1347
01:21:38,006 --> 01:21:40,270
She in heaven now.

1348
01:21:41,042 --> 01:21:44,307
Damn! I thought the movie was bad.

1349
01:21:44,412 --> 01:21:47,540
She sleep forever.

1350
01:21:47,649 --> 01:21:50,777
To the man's credit, he's actually
eased up on the retard throttle.

1351
01:21:50,885 --> 01:21:54,480
And now that's added a balance,
and the audience can connect.

1352
01:21:54,589 --> 01:21:58,389
I mean, this is theater 101,
but, you know, he's had a tough road.

1353
01:21:58,493 --> 01:21:59,619
He'll become a naturalist.

1354
01:21:59,727 --> 01:22:01,447
- Yeah.
- Break down the aesthetic distance,

1355
01:22:01,529 --> 01:22:03,258
then the...

1356
01:22:05,933 --> 01:22:07,560
Told you I'd tag you back.

1357
01:22:10,238 --> 01:22:12,502
Can I tell you that I'm sorry

1358
01:22:12,607 --> 01:22:14,905
for any offense I might've caused, man?

1359
01:22:15,009 --> 01:22:17,375
- I just got caught up in...
- In being a dumbass?

1360
01:22:17,478 --> 01:22:18,877
I guess so.

1361
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:21,676
Why you still doing this
chicken George shit, I have no idea.

1362
01:22:21,783 --> 01:22:23,080
- Neither do I.
- It's beyond me.

1363
01:22:23,184 --> 01:22:25,379
- It's beyond me.
- You confused.

1364
01:22:25,486 --> 01:22:27,420
- I am a little confused.
- I know.

1365
01:22:29,023 --> 01:22:30,820
But are we cool?

1366
01:22:30,925 --> 01:22:32,256
Not really.

1367
01:22:36,064 --> 01:22:37,656
Hey, man.

1368
01:22:37,765 --> 01:22:39,460
- How's it going?
- Good. Yourself?

1369
01:22:39,567 --> 01:22:41,592
Hey, so, if it's no big deal,

1370
01:22:41,703 --> 01:22:44,570
I think I'm just gonna hang back here
for the mission.

1371
01:22:44,672 --> 01:22:46,299
Watch the stuff.

1372
01:22:46,407 --> 01:22:48,432
- Is that cool?
- What? No!

1373
01:22:48,543 --> 01:22:50,443
We need you, Jeff.

1374
01:22:50,545 --> 01:22:52,137
What are you talking about?

1375
01:22:52,246 --> 01:22:53,804
Okay, look, man.

1376
01:22:55,049 --> 01:22:57,347
- I got something to tell you.
- Okay.

1377
01:22:59,587 --> 01:23:02,317
You know those jellybeans
I was eating?

1378
01:23:02,423 --> 01:23:05,517
Well, they weren't jellybeans, okay?

1379
01:23:06,427 --> 01:23:09,225
- They were drugs.
- Really?

1380
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:13,699
I get down there near the mother lode,
I am done. I'm jonesing bad, man.

1381
01:23:13,801 --> 01:23:16,736
I'm gonna fucking do all the heroin
in the fucking world.

1382
01:23:20,041 --> 01:23:24,205
If you guys wanna make it through
this thing, you gotta strap me to a tree.

1383
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:29,346
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious. Literally, a tree.

1384
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:32,330
And you can, no matter what, you can't
fucking untie me until it is done,

1385
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:33,978
until it is out of my system.

1386
01:23:34,088 --> 01:23:35,715
I'm gonna say,
"hey, man, I'm cool. It's cool.

1387
01:23:35,823 --> 01:23:37,381
"I'm finally better. I'm finally better.
Untie me."

1388
01:23:37,492 --> 01:23:40,689
Don't listen to me!
Anything I fucking say is a lie!

1389
01:23:40,795 --> 01:23:42,126
You got it!

1390
01:23:42,797 --> 01:23:44,856
Goodbye, mama!

1391
01:23:44,966 --> 01:23:48,094
Now you can have ice cream in heaven.

1392
01:23:48,202 --> 01:23:53,162
I'll see you tonight, when I go to bed,
in my head movies.

1393
01:23:54,108 --> 01:23:58,704
But this head movie
makes my eyes rain.

1394
01:24:07,755 --> 01:24:10,986
Dang.
Short-bus is taking some real hits.

1395
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:15,658
- They got him on the move!
- That's torture, man.

1396
01:24:15,797 --> 01:24:18,664
Okay. That's where they keeping him.

1397
01:24:18,766 --> 01:24:20,961
I gotta get cracking on my costume.

1398
01:24:21,068 --> 01:24:22,467
Say, are you good
with a needle and thread?

1399
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:23,594
Hell, yeah.

1400
01:24:23,704 --> 01:24:27,037
Alpa chino chinos sold more than
five million pairs last spring at the gap.

1401
01:24:27,141 --> 01:24:29,837
- I sewed them patterns myself, baby.
- Let's roll out.

1402
01:25:01,843 --> 01:25:04,073
It's a little twig man Oscar.

1403
01:25:10,685 --> 01:25:13,085
I'm going to call you half squat.

1404
01:25:14,789 --> 01:25:16,757
And you can call me

1405
01:25:17,825 --> 01:25:19,122
papa.

1406
01:25:42,617 --> 01:25:44,346
Wow, look at all those stars.

1407
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,288
Really makes a guy feel pretty small.

1408
01:25:49,824 --> 01:25:52,384
This could be the last time
we look at these stars.

1409
01:25:53,361 --> 01:25:54,828
Man, that's beauty.

1410
01:25:56,764 --> 01:25:59,824
Nights like tonight
make a man wonder what it's all about.

1411
01:25:59,934 --> 01:26:02,232
Hey, you guys.
Anybody got some bug spray?

1412
01:26:04,071 --> 01:26:05,197
Don't ignore me!

1413
01:26:05,306 --> 01:26:08,173
Stick it out, man.
We're gonna get through this.

1414
01:26:09,310 --> 01:26:11,369
- Hey, kirk?
- Yeah?

1415
01:26:11,479 --> 01:26:14,312
Are you still dating
Jennifer love Hewitt?

1416
01:26:14,415 --> 01:26:15,814
'Cause I think she's hot.

1417
01:26:15,917 --> 01:26:19,284
No, that was just some
tabloid conjecture.

1418
01:26:19,387 --> 01:26:23,380
Hey, guys, I'm good. I made it through.
You can untie me now.

1419
01:26:24,458 --> 01:26:25,789
Funny, huh?

1420
01:26:25,893 --> 01:26:28,794
The circus life 280 days a year
on location.

1421
01:26:30,031 --> 01:26:32,932
It's hard to find a girl
that can hang with that, you know?

1422
01:26:34,735 --> 01:26:36,794
Not one worth keeping, nohow.

1423
01:26:36,904 --> 01:26:39,202
Hey, radar? Evans?

1424
01:26:39,307 --> 01:26:40,365
No, it's Kevin.

1425
01:26:40,474 --> 01:26:42,203
Kev, whatever the fuck.
Come over here.

1426
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:44,540
I didn't tell you, but fatties: Fart three
is coming down the pike,

1427
01:26:44,645 --> 01:26:48,137
and there's a role in there for you
if you come over and untie me.

1428
01:26:48,249 --> 01:26:50,809
Jeff, you're just going to
have to tough it out.

1429
01:26:50,918 --> 01:26:52,886
Your mother's a cankerous whore!

1430
01:26:52,987 --> 01:26:54,318
Jesus, man.

1431
01:26:55,356 --> 01:26:56,823
Hey, man.

1432
01:26:56,924 --> 01:26:59,825
Remember way back when I said
your mother was a cankerous whore?

1433
01:26:59,927 --> 01:27:03,328
I'm sorry, man.
I did not mean that. She's not.

1434
01:27:03,431 --> 01:27:05,126
How about you, man?

1435
01:27:05,266 --> 01:27:07,700
You got some little minx waiting for you
on the other side of tomorrow?

1436
01:27:07,802 --> 01:27:09,269
Me?

1437
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:12,134
I've barely even had a girlfriend, and...

1438
01:27:12,974 --> 01:27:16,637
I was really hoping I'd get laid
when this movie came out,

1439
01:27:16,744 --> 01:27:19,144
but that's not gonna happen.

1440
01:27:20,014 --> 01:27:21,481
What about you, masterblaster?

1441
01:27:21,582 --> 01:27:24,263
You got a certain someone you trying
to get with back in the states?

1442
01:27:24,318 --> 01:27:29,051
What, alpa chino?
He's like 10 girls deep, 24/7.

1443
01:27:29,156 --> 01:27:30,384
No. You missing me, man.

1444
01:27:30,491 --> 01:27:32,288
I'm talking about something special.
Big difference.

1445
01:27:32,393 --> 01:27:33,587
How about it?

1446
01:27:34,362 --> 01:27:35,488
Yeah.

1447
01:27:36,897 --> 01:27:38,865
Yeah, there is.

1448
01:27:38,966 --> 01:27:42,299
Well? What's the skinny?
Y'all been on a date or what?

1449
01:27:42,403 --> 01:27:44,303
No. I mean...

1450
01:27:44,405 --> 01:27:49,240
I always wanted to, but I guess
I just never had the courage to ask.

1451
01:27:49,343 --> 01:27:51,038
It's... it's complicated.

1452
01:27:51,145 --> 01:27:53,579
No! It's simple as pie, man.

1453
01:27:53,681 --> 01:27:56,275
You plant your feet in the ground, you
look her square in the eyes, you say,

1454
01:27:56,384 --> 01:28:00,013
"hey, baby, you and me's going
on a date." That's the end of story.

1455
01:28:00,121 --> 01:28:02,817
- What's her name?
- Lance.

1456
01:28:02,923 --> 01:28:04,686
"Listen here, Lance..."

1457
01:28:05,559 --> 01:28:09,359
Lance? What the fuck did I just hear?
Lance?

1458
01:28:09,463 --> 01:28:11,192
- Did you say "Lance"?
- No!

1459
01:28:11,298 --> 01:28:13,258
- That sounded like "Lance."
- No, I said "Nance."

1460
01:28:13,334 --> 01:28:15,575
- That's what I said, "Nance."
- It sounded like "Lance."

1461
01:28:15,603 --> 01:28:17,127
Look, I'm alpa chino, okay?

1462
01:28:17,238 --> 01:28:18,899
I love the pussy! All right?

1463
01:28:19,006 --> 01:28:20,906
Lay your ass back down
and look at the stars.

1464
01:28:21,042 --> 01:28:22,373
When you wrote I love tha pussy

1465
01:28:22,476 --> 01:28:25,843
was you thinking of dangling your dice
on Lance's forehead?

1466
01:28:25,946 --> 01:28:28,312
Oh, hell, no! What? Come on. Look.

1467
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:31,351
- Man, everyone's gay once in a while.
- I'm not gay!

1468
01:28:31,452 --> 01:28:32,476
This Hollywood.

1469
01:28:32,586 --> 01:28:33,644
How about we all get back to work?

1470
01:28:33,754 --> 01:28:35,415
- Okay. Cool.
- This is ridiculous!

1471
01:28:35,523 --> 01:28:38,424
We got a big day tomorrow.
Let's get focused.

1472
01:28:40,995 --> 01:28:45,830
Alpa, if you untie me,
I will literally suck your dick right now.

1473
01:28:45,933 --> 01:28:49,164
I told you, for the last time,
I love the pussy!

1474
01:28:50,538 --> 01:28:53,371
I'll cradle the balls, stroke the shaft,

1475
01:28:53,474 --> 01:28:56,568
work the pipe and swallow the gravy.

1476
01:28:56,677 --> 01:28:58,736
Get it over here, buddy. Let's do this.

1477
01:29:05,319 --> 01:29:06,377
Okay, so, what's the plan?

1478
01:29:06,487 --> 01:29:07,886
Are you gonna talk vietnamese
to those dudes?

1479
01:29:07,988 --> 01:29:09,751
No. No. Mandarin Chinese.

1480
01:29:09,857 --> 01:29:11,552
Which, from what I can tell,
is what they speaking down there.

1481
01:29:11,659 --> 01:29:13,217
How the hell do you know Chinese?

1482
01:29:13,327 --> 01:29:16,785
Land of silk and money with gong li.
Second globe, third Oscar.

1483
01:29:16,897 --> 01:29:20,856
Prepped for that one by working in
a Beijing textile factory for eight months.

1484
01:29:20,968 --> 01:29:22,902
That might be our ride.

1485
01:29:39,653 --> 01:29:40,881
The straps are too tight!

1486
01:29:40,988 --> 01:29:43,354
Shut your mouth and follow my lead.

1487
01:30:11,252 --> 01:30:14,221
The straps are cutting off
my circulation!

1488
01:30:14,321 --> 01:30:15,321
Fuck you!

1489
01:30:22,797 --> 01:30:25,698
Not the fucking bull again.
Fucking asshole.

1490
01:31:19,753 --> 01:31:22,449
Laz, don't let him take me off the yak.

1491
01:31:26,961 --> 01:31:29,225
Bitch whore! Fucking hate you!

1492
01:31:39,373 --> 01:31:40,567
Okay.

1493
01:31:42,776 --> 01:31:44,334
All right.

1494
01:31:44,445 --> 01:31:46,845
That looks like it could be
the munitions hut right there.

1495
01:31:46,947 --> 01:31:49,006
I'm gonna try to find speedman
in the main building.

1496
01:32:06,901 --> 01:32:10,598
I don't know Chinese but it sounds like
your improvising is for shit.

1497
01:32:10,704 --> 01:32:11,830
Oh, fuck!

1498
01:32:27,354 --> 01:32:28,946
Get over here!

1499
01:32:30,324 --> 01:32:31,882
- What are you guys doing here?
- He has hands.

1500
01:32:31,992 --> 01:32:34,392
- He killed Damien.
- Bullshit!

1501
01:32:34,495 --> 01:32:36,986
- He blinded Jamie Lee Curtis.
- Almost!

1502
01:32:37,097 --> 01:32:40,294
What are you talking about?
Damien stepped on a old landmine.

1503
01:32:40,401 --> 01:32:41,959
Sweet. Thank God.

1504
01:32:42,069 --> 01:32:44,264
- We busting speedman out.
- Speedman's here?

1505
01:33:12,433 --> 01:33:15,027
I take it y'all are doing
the wet offensive from the book.

1506
01:33:15,135 --> 01:33:16,397
I can give y'all a diversion.

1507
01:33:16,503 --> 01:33:20,439
I got enough shit here to light this place
up like it's the fourth of fucking July.

1508
01:34:01,915 --> 01:34:04,383
Yes, your farm.

1509
01:34:08,756 --> 01:34:11,156
Where is your farm,

1510
01:34:12,726 --> 01:34:14,193
American?

1511
01:34:17,031 --> 01:34:18,293
My farm?

1512
01:34:20,234 --> 01:34:21,496
Oh, shit.

1513
01:34:22,269 --> 01:34:25,466
Here's my motherfucking farm!

1514
01:34:25,572 --> 01:34:27,062
Yeah!

1515
01:34:32,012 --> 01:34:35,004
Yeah! Chicka-chickaw, baby!

1516
01:34:36,016 --> 01:34:37,210
Kwan-lo!

1517
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:40,619
I'm a lead farmer, motherfucker!

1518
01:34:41,121 --> 01:34:42,281
Yeah!

1519
01:34:43,857 --> 01:34:47,054
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
keep your head down!

1520
01:34:47,161 --> 01:34:49,425
Keep your head down on the ground!

1521
01:34:49,530 --> 01:34:51,691
Nobody move or I do the little big guy!

1522
01:34:51,799 --> 01:34:55,235
That's right,
we running this program now, j.P.

1523
01:34:55,335 --> 01:34:57,963
Now show me where the drugs are.

1524
01:34:58,072 --> 01:34:59,869
What the fuck?

1525
01:34:59,973 --> 01:35:01,668
That ain't the plan!

1526
01:35:01,775 --> 01:35:03,470
Don't judge me!

1527
01:35:07,147 --> 01:35:08,910
He's got a real serious problem.

1528
01:35:09,716 --> 01:35:11,980
Hey! Hey, you!

1529
01:35:12,086 --> 01:35:16,049
Take off your clothes!

1530
01:35:16,156 --> 01:35:17,453
What do we do now?

1531
01:35:17,558 --> 01:35:19,389
Stick with the plan. Find speedman.

1532
01:35:19,493 --> 01:35:21,893
Alpa, keep this clown posse down.
Come on now.

1533
01:35:21,995 --> 01:35:25,362
Y'all heard the man.
Be suede, don't move!

1534
01:35:25,466 --> 01:35:27,366
Fuck your do-rag. Fuck your do-rag.

1535
01:35:27,468 --> 01:35:29,959
- Door!
- One, two, three!

1536
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:45,081
I go high, you go low.

1537
01:35:49,456 --> 01:35:53,324
Get down. Get down! Get down!
Chow yun-fat, get the hell down!

1538
01:35:53,427 --> 01:35:56,726
If I see one more head pop up,
it's gonna be bullet whac-a-mole.

1539
01:35:58,298 --> 01:35:59,731
Come on, come on!

1540
01:35:59,833 --> 01:36:01,824
- Smoke grenade.
- Don't drop it now.

1541
01:36:02,503 --> 01:36:04,061
Here.

1542
01:36:04,171 --> 01:36:06,568
- What's this?
- I don't know what it's called.

1543
01:36:06,673 --> 01:36:09,267
I just know the sound it makes
when it lies.

1544
01:36:09,376 --> 01:36:12,903
Don't move, matchbox,
or I will shoot you.

1545
01:36:13,013 --> 01:36:15,880
I'm gonna put on this thing. Don't move.

1546
01:36:15,983 --> 01:36:17,712
I can still see you.

1547
01:36:23,857 --> 01:36:24,949
Tugg!

1548
01:36:27,494 --> 01:36:28,654
Tugg?

1549
01:36:30,731 --> 01:36:31,925
Gotcha.

1550
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:36,001
Roll your shit up, man. We going home.

1551
01:36:36,103 --> 01:36:37,229
Home?

1552
01:36:39,373 --> 01:36:43,207
But I'm doing five shows a day
for a standing-room-only crowd.

1553
01:36:43,310 --> 01:36:45,870
Don't you get it? I already am home.

1554
01:36:48,182 --> 01:36:51,310
All right, now, dude, you gotta get it...

1555
01:36:51,418 --> 01:36:53,613
My son gave this to me.

1556
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:57,212
- That's your stick buddy?
- His name is twigman.

1557
01:36:57,324 --> 01:36:59,155
Does he wanna come with us?

1558
01:37:20,147 --> 01:37:22,274
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1559
01:37:22,382 --> 01:37:27,342
Maybe y'all heard of me.
Y'all heard of alpa chino? No?

1560
01:37:27,454 --> 01:37:29,922
I love that pussy, hell, yeah, hell, yeah

1561
01:37:30,023 --> 01:37:31,149
they're not your demo, dude.

1562
01:37:31,625 --> 01:37:34,025
Come on.
Six motherfucking vmas, baby.

1563
01:37:34,127 --> 01:37:37,324
Two bet awards. Alpa chino.

1564
01:37:37,431 --> 01:37:43,836
Like him in carlito's way?

1565
01:37:44,204 --> 01:37:46,866
Hey, yo, you know what?
Speak English. I don't speak that stuff.

1566
01:37:46,974 --> 01:37:48,908
What're you sayin'? Huh?

1567
01:37:49,009 --> 01:37:53,571
Devil's advocate. Dog day afternoon.

1568
01:37:53,947 --> 01:37:56,780
Cruising. Sea of love.

1569
01:37:56,883 --> 01:37:59,875
Real Al Pacino.

1570
01:37:59,987 --> 01:38:03,582
Get the fuck down. That's a whole
different dude altogether.

1571
01:38:03,690 --> 01:38:06,750
What you doing? What you doing?
Don't touch that gun.

1572
01:38:06,860 --> 01:38:08,259
Don't do it! Don't touch that gun!

1573
01:38:08,362 --> 01:38:10,660
On my momma, if you touch that gun...

1574
01:38:15,302 --> 01:38:17,702
- Oh, shit, it's on!
- Over here!

1575
01:38:52,105 --> 01:38:53,868
- What're you doing?
- I'm gonna give these boys

1576
01:38:53,974 --> 01:38:55,601
a hanoi high-five.

1577
01:39:08,255 --> 01:39:09,620
Shadow me, Pinocchio!

1578
01:39:10,390 --> 01:39:11,618
Smoke!

1579
01:39:17,464 --> 01:39:19,159
Oh, shit!

1580
01:39:24,004 --> 01:39:25,528
Jeff, don't!

1581
01:39:26,373 --> 01:39:28,364
It doesn't matter what I do.

1582
01:39:28,475 --> 01:39:31,444
I'll always be a screw-up.
No one'll ever respect me.

1583
01:39:31,545 --> 01:39:35,538
That is not true, you are not a screw-up!
You make so many people laugh.

1584
01:39:35,649 --> 01:39:37,879
They only laugh at my farts.

1585
01:39:37,984 --> 01:39:39,975
Jeff, we really need to go now!

1586
01:39:40,087 --> 01:39:41,679
This is all I deserve!

1587
01:40:01,842 --> 01:40:04,072
Laugh at that, you bastards!

1588
01:40:04,177 --> 01:40:07,578
Hilarious! Hilarious!

1589
01:40:09,116 --> 01:40:11,949
Let's move. We only have 16 hours
before they wake up.

1590
01:40:28,235 --> 01:40:29,827
Sounds like the dinner bell's ringing.

1591
01:40:29,936 --> 01:40:32,871
These assholes are gonna be crawling
in here ready to fucking eat us.

1592
01:40:35,809 --> 01:40:38,676
There. All right, you keep six right here.

1593
01:40:40,614 --> 01:40:42,775
Come on, let's go.

1594
01:40:42,883 --> 01:40:44,817
Come on, what are you guys doing?
Let's get out of here!

1595
01:40:44,918 --> 01:40:46,579
He's on tilt status.

1596
01:40:46,686 --> 01:40:50,645
Same thing happened to me when
I played Neil Armstrong in moonshot.

1597
01:40:50,757 --> 01:40:52,850
They found me in an alley in Burbank

1598
01:40:52,959 --> 01:40:56,190
trying to re-enter the earth's
atmosphere in an old refrigerator box.

1599
01:40:56,930 --> 01:40:57,988
What're you talking about?

1600
01:40:58,098 --> 01:41:00,464
Come on, fellas, we really need to go.

1601
01:41:00,567 --> 01:41:05,004
Daggomit, blamtucky,
I ain't re-programming a vcr.

1602
01:41:10,911 --> 01:41:13,141
Give me the flame thrower.
You gotta start the chopper.

1603
01:41:13,246 --> 01:41:16,682
- No, fuck that! Just give me this.
- No time! I'll take care of this!

1604
01:41:17,918 --> 01:41:19,818
All right. Give me your hooks.

1605
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,547
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna put them on again.

1606
01:41:21,655 --> 01:41:24,488
- Just give me your goddamn hooks.
- All right. Here.

1607
01:41:24,591 --> 01:41:26,752
Get those boys back to the bird, pronto!

1608
01:41:31,698 --> 01:41:33,859
Shit! Enough!

1609
01:41:33,967 --> 01:41:35,867
Fake shit!

1610
01:41:38,972 --> 01:41:40,098
Fuck!

1611
01:41:47,814 --> 01:41:50,977
Go get your guys!
Get them to the chopper!

1612
01:41:51,084 --> 01:41:53,177
I'll take care of these yahoos!

1613
01:41:55,222 --> 01:41:57,486
You're gonna focus up now,
motherfucker, and say it.

1614
01:41:57,591 --> 01:41:59,718
- "It's me, tugg!"
- It's me, tugg.

1615
01:41:59,826 --> 01:42:01,293
That's right! Now, tugg who?

1616
01:42:01,394 --> 01:42:04,192
- Tugg who? I don't know. Who are you?
- Me?

1617
01:42:04,297 --> 01:42:05,992
I know who I am!

1618
01:42:06,099 --> 01:42:09,830
I'm a dude playing a dude
disguised as another dude.

1619
01:42:09,936 --> 01:42:10,994
What?

1620
01:42:11,104 --> 01:42:13,197
You a dude
that don't know what dude he is!

1621
01:42:13,306 --> 01:42:16,002
Or are you a dude who has no idea
what dude he is

1622
01:42:16,109 --> 01:42:17,371
and claims to know what dude he is...

1623
01:42:17,477 --> 01:42:19,240
What the fuck
are you guys talking about?

1624
01:42:19,346 --> 01:42:20,438
By playing other dudes?

1625
01:42:20,547 --> 01:42:21,741
I know what dude I am!

1626
01:42:21,848 --> 01:42:24,646
- You're scared.
- I ain't scared. Scared of what?

1627
01:42:24,751 --> 01:42:26,013
Or scared of who?

1628
01:42:26,119 --> 01:42:28,713
- Scared of who?
- Come on, guys. We really need to go!

1629
01:42:28,822 --> 01:42:30,084
Scared of you.

1630
01:42:34,995 --> 01:42:37,327
- Jesus.
- What's going on?

1631
01:42:37,430 --> 01:42:38,954
The dudes are emerging.

1632
01:42:39,065 --> 01:42:40,396
He's right, you know.

1633
01:42:42,168 --> 01:42:43,567
I am not

1634
01:42:45,138 --> 01:42:46,833
sergeant Lincoln osiris.

1635
01:42:51,244 --> 01:42:52,711
We gotta roll out.

1636
01:42:52,812 --> 01:42:56,043
Nor am I father O'Malley.

1637
01:42:58,285 --> 01:43:01,220
Or Neil Armstrong.

1638
01:43:08,795 --> 01:43:10,956
I think I might be nobody.

1639
01:43:12,365 --> 01:43:13,525
Wow!

1640
01:43:13,633 --> 01:43:16,295
The insecurity level
with you guys is ridiculous!

1641
01:43:17,571 --> 01:43:20,540
- Everybody's got issues!
- Yeah, man, everybody got issues.

1642
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:23,200
Come on! You're kirk Lazarus.

1643
01:43:23,310 --> 01:43:25,471
You're the whole reason
I got into acting.

1644
01:43:25,579 --> 01:43:27,410
I memorized every single monologue

1645
01:43:27,514 --> 01:43:30,108
you ever did
when I was in theater school.

1646
01:43:30,216 --> 01:43:32,241
- Really?
- Yeah. And look, tugg!

1647
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:34,786
I saw scorcher I
24 times when I was in eighth grade.

1648
01:43:34,888 --> 01:43:37,857
That shit blew me away!
I got high to that shit! You the man!

1649
01:43:37,958 --> 01:43:41,086
Yeah, man, scorcher I was great.
Let's get the fuck out of here!

1650
01:43:41,194 --> 01:43:45,324
Tugg, tugger, you're the last piece
of the puzzle, buddy.

1651
01:43:45,432 --> 01:43:48,424
We need you! Your men need you!
Are you with us?

1652
01:43:52,772 --> 01:43:54,763
I'm a rooster illusion.

1653
01:43:54,874 --> 01:43:56,068
Fuck it. We'll deal with him later.

1654
01:43:56,176 --> 01:43:59,339
Let's move. Come on. Come on.
Double time. Gotta go!

1655
01:44:01,881 --> 01:44:03,678
Come on, come on, come on.

1656
01:44:07,454 --> 01:44:09,388
Bingo! Move out.

1657
01:44:11,324 --> 01:44:12,689
Oh, God.

1658
01:44:14,661 --> 01:44:17,528
Just say no to this,
you drug-making midget.

1659
01:44:22,102 --> 01:44:23,569
Gotta hold on!

1660
01:44:29,743 --> 01:44:31,108
Four leaf!

1661
01:44:35,849 --> 01:44:37,180
You grew hands?

1662
01:44:46,426 --> 01:44:47,950
Rpg, gentlemen!

1663
01:44:50,730 --> 01:44:52,254
Where are you going?

1664
01:44:57,771 --> 01:45:00,296
Oh, my God.
I am moving to catering after this.

1665
01:45:22,328 --> 01:45:23,659
My ass!

1666
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:28,231
My ass!

1667
01:45:29,836 --> 01:45:33,101
Hey, yo!
We gotta get our shit together, tugg!

1668
01:45:33,206 --> 01:45:35,436
We gotta get his cracker ass
to the chopper!

1669
01:45:35,542 --> 01:45:39,842
Are you still crazy?
We gotta get candisky to the chopper!

1670
01:45:39,946 --> 01:45:41,413
It's sandusky.

1671
01:45:43,283 --> 01:45:46,582
- Kevin sandusky.
- That's my name.

1672
01:45:46,686 --> 01:45:48,278
You remembered my name.

1673
01:45:48,388 --> 01:45:50,413
Alpa, go help Cody.

1674
01:45:50,523 --> 01:45:52,514
Portnoy, get sandusky
back to the chopper. Go!

1675
01:45:52,625 --> 01:45:54,456
- I got him!
- Let's go!

1676
01:45:55,895 --> 01:45:57,419
Let's get out of here!

1677
01:46:09,309 --> 01:46:10,799
Hey, leaf!

1678
01:46:10,910 --> 01:46:12,138
- Leaf!
- Yeah.

1679
01:46:12,245 --> 01:46:13,245
Hit the plunger

1680
01:46:13,346 --> 01:46:15,106
- as soon as they clear the bridge!
- Got it!

1681
01:46:19,786 --> 01:46:22,220
Come on! Get in the chopper!

1682
01:46:22,422 --> 01:46:25,220
- Come on! Move!
- Kirk! Wait!

1683
01:46:29,763 --> 01:46:31,390
Laz, I'm gonna blow the bridge!

1684
01:46:31,498 --> 01:46:33,295
Are you the special effects guy?

1685
01:46:33,399 --> 01:46:35,526
- You God damn right I am.
- Fuck yeah!

1686
01:46:35,935 --> 01:46:37,129
Leaf's about to blow the bridge.
Come on!

1687
01:46:37,237 --> 01:46:39,831
You don't have to! You don't have to!
I'm staying.

1688
01:46:39,939 --> 01:46:41,429
No, I can't let you do that, mate.
We gotta go.

1689
01:46:41,541 --> 01:46:44,066
No, I'm telling you, I'm not being crazy.
They'll listen to me.

1690
01:46:44,177 --> 01:46:46,668
I know it sounds weird,
but I have a connection with them.

1691
01:46:46,780 --> 01:46:49,660
You're not doing tofu dinner theater
for these motherfuckers. Let's roll!

1692
01:46:49,682 --> 01:46:53,516
- Get over here!
- I have a son now. Little half squat.

1693
01:46:53,620 --> 01:46:55,178
Who in crikey fuck is half squat?

1694
01:46:55,288 --> 01:46:57,518
He's my son. He's my boy!

1695
01:46:57,624 --> 01:47:00,058
He needs me. I have to go back to him.

1696
01:47:03,196 --> 01:47:04,857
You tell the world what happened here.

1697
01:47:04,964 --> 01:47:06,795
What happened here?

1698
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:09,130
I don't know, but you need to tell them.

1699
01:47:11,504 --> 01:47:13,335
I got this.

1700
01:47:13,439 --> 01:47:14,599
Tugg!

1701
01:47:15,308 --> 01:47:18,869
You take care of the boys!
I'll deal with these guys.

1702
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:23,875
Where is he going?
We're gonna fucking die!

1703
01:47:23,983 --> 01:47:26,611
Laz, come on. He joined the circus.
Let's go.

1704
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:27,913
- You've got hands.
- Yeah.

1705
01:47:28,021 --> 01:47:30,148
- Fuck! You've got hands?
- Come on!

1706
01:47:31,224 --> 01:47:32,350
- Come on!
- Get in!

1707
01:47:32,458 --> 01:47:34,085
- Come on!
- He's staying?

1708
01:47:34,194 --> 01:47:36,458
Go! He's a lost cause, mate!
Get out of here!

1709
01:47:41,034 --> 01:47:45,528
I was wrong! Blow the bridge!
Blow the fucking bridge!

1710
01:47:51,377 --> 01:47:52,776
I got this.

1711
01:47:53,446 --> 01:47:54,879
Leaf, no!

1712
01:48:39,025 --> 01:48:41,653
It's over! He's gone!

1713
01:48:41,761 --> 01:48:43,820
Cody! We gotta go!

1714
01:48:45,832 --> 01:48:47,026
Look.

1715
01:49:09,656 --> 01:49:10,987
Think he's done.

1716
01:49:11,090 --> 01:49:12,318
Cover me!

1717
01:49:13,393 --> 01:49:16,328
- Come on!
- Wait, come back!

1718
01:49:16,429 --> 01:49:18,158
How do we cover him?

1719
01:49:22,402 --> 01:49:25,803
All right, game over. Come on, mate.
Come on.

1720
01:49:25,905 --> 01:49:28,499
- You all right, man?
- I'm cold.

1721
01:49:28,608 --> 01:49:30,599
I can't feel my legs.

1722
01:49:30,710 --> 01:49:33,645
No, no, they're in a puddle, mate. See?
There's a puddle right there.

1723
01:49:33,746 --> 01:49:34,940
- No worries.
- Good.

1724
01:49:35,048 --> 01:49:36,345
Come on, we gotta split, man.

1725
01:49:36,449 --> 01:49:38,747
- You guys came back for me.
- Course.

1726
01:49:38,851 --> 01:49:41,183
Hey! I want you to know something.

1727
01:49:41,287 --> 01:49:42,481
What?

1728
01:49:43,656 --> 01:49:45,453
I know who you are.

1729
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:49,323
You're my friend.

1730
01:49:51,597 --> 01:49:53,224
You're my brother.

1731
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:56,933
But like a really cool brother, you know?

1732
01:49:57,036 --> 01:49:58,401
Like a brother
where there was no animosity or...

1733
01:49:58,504 --> 01:50:01,337
Don't look now,
you got some real tears going.

1734
01:50:01,441 --> 01:50:02,441
Really?

1735
01:50:02,542 --> 01:50:04,032
That's the stuff
that accolades are made of.

1736
01:50:04,143 --> 01:50:05,610
Jesus, let's go, man!

1737
01:50:05,712 --> 01:50:07,813
All right?

1738
01:50:08,748 --> 01:50:10,181
Upsy-Daisy.

1739
01:50:11,951 --> 01:50:14,943
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

1740
01:50:17,090 --> 01:50:18,387
Get in! Get in!

1741
01:50:18,491 --> 01:50:20,516
Come on! Here we go!

1742
01:50:23,062 --> 01:50:25,860
Tuggernuts! I got it!

1743
01:50:28,234 --> 01:50:30,532
- Tugger!
- Rick!

1744
01:50:33,139 --> 01:50:34,367
What the fuck?

1745
01:50:34,474 --> 01:50:36,101
I got the TiVo!

1746
01:50:37,010 --> 01:50:41,413
My friend wants a TiVo,
my friend gets a TiVo!

1747
01:50:46,586 --> 01:50:47,848
Oh, shit!

1748
01:51:24,690 --> 01:51:26,715
And the Oscar goes to...

1749
01:51:29,462 --> 01:51:31,760
Yes! Tugg speedman.

1750
01:51:33,399 --> 01:51:36,095
"Tropic blunder,
the true story behind the making

1751
01:51:36,202 --> 01:51:38,727
"of the most expensive
fake true war story ever."

1752
01:51:40,306 --> 01:51:41,432
Yeah!

1753
01:51:46,145 --> 01:51:48,045
Yeah, you son of a bitch!

1754
01:52:07,366 --> 01:52:11,735
Eight oscars, $400 million

1755
01:52:11,838 --> 01:52:15,069
and you saved
tugg speedman's career.

1756
01:52:15,174 --> 01:52:18,041
I couldn't have done it
without you, slolom.

1757
01:52:20,079 --> 01:52:21,171
Really?

1758
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:23,271
No, dickhead, of course I could.

1759
01:52:23,382 --> 01:52:26,044
- A nutless monkey could do your job.
- Well, I...

1760
01:52:26,152 --> 01:52:29,053
Now, go get drunk
and take credit at all the parties.

1761
01:52:29,155 --> 01:52:31,851
- I would never do that to...
- Joking.

1762
01:52:31,958 --> 01:52:33,323
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1763
01:52:33,426 --> 01:52:35,621
Very... okay, there he is.

1764
01:52:35,728 --> 01:52:37,218
- There he is. Okay.
- Go have fun.

1765
01:52:37,330 --> 01:52:38,854
All right. We're having a...

1766
01:52:38,965 --> 01:52:41,445
Fuck, okay. Thank you, les.
Thank you. You have a good night...

1767
01:52:41,467 --> 01:52:43,867
But seriously,
a nutless monkey could do your job.

1768
01:52:43,970 --> 01:52:45,699
Good. Thank you, sir.
