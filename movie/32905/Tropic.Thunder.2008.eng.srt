00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,897
你看到好莱坞那单工作了吗?
Hey. you see that access hollywood piece?

258
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,944
看到了  就像往小瞎子身上放枪
Yeah, I did. it was like pistol-whipping a blind kid.

259
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:24,482
我不会接这破工作的  塔格  你是超级巨星!
I mean, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, Tugg. you are a huge star, all right?

260
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,050
但现在
But right now,

261
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,709
你就像操场上身单影孤的小毛孩
You're like that kid on the playground, you know,

262
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,789
就是身上有虱子所以没有朋友的那个
The one who has lice that none of the other kids want to play with?

263
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,880
-你是说?  -我是说要把你整理干净
- what do you mean? - I mean we gotta shave your head

264
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,460
拉回到儿童乐园的层面
And get you back on the monkey bars, right?

265
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,892
什么?
What?

266
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,861
对了  哭戏拍的怎么样?
How did the crying scene go?

267
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,727
非常糟糕  拉扎勒斯开始哭了
Horrible. Lazarus started crying.

268
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,996
并且伴随着剧本上没有提到的潺潺口水...
Then he starts drooling and dribbling, and it wasn't even in the script...

269
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,195
别说了
Stop right there!

270
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,033
你得加把劲了  拖拉船先生
You gotta buck up here, Tuggboat.

271
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,835
谁关心他的演技天分比你多?
Who cares how much more talented he may be than you?

272
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:53,309
他哭了  你就要哭的比他更猛
If he cries, you cry harder, man.

273
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,573
你小时候  你家的狗有没有
Didn't your dog have, like, leukemia or something

274
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,046
白血病之类的?  想想那个场景
When you were a kid? I mean, think of that.

275
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,084
胜负就揭晓了  他们数码录影机弄好了么?
Boom! end of story. they hook up the tivo yet?

276
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,675
-还没  -什么?
- no. - what?

277
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,687
他们有自己的数码有线电缆  没关系嘛
They have digital cable, but, I mean, it's okay.

278
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,019
什么没关系  拜托  大大滴有关系
No, no, no. come on, man. it's not okay.

279
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,252
你滴明白?  塔格!
It is not okay, Tugg!

280
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,488
你不需要解释为什么要数码录影机
And you don't need to explain to me why you need tivo

281
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:15,533
纯净水  干净床单  食物  睡觉的地方
Or clean water, clean sheets, food, shelter.

282
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:18,728
我都已经把这些争取到合同里了
I mean, I fought for that in your contract.

283
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,896
那收养的事又如何了?
How's the adoption thing coming, buddy?

284
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,031
不咋滴
Not too great.

285
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,708
好吧  至少你能自己挑
Well, at least you get to choose yours.

286
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,643
我已经死会了
I'm stuck with mine.

287
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,074
回去工作吧  天才士兵
Tell you what, get back to work, genius soldier.

288
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:36,052
派克去帮你完成数码录影机任务
The Pecker's on a tivo mission for the y-o-u.

289
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,918
用吃奶的力气挤出点眼泪来  亲爱的
Work on those tears, my man.

290
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,115
好吧  我会的
All right. yeah.

291
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,782
再对我说一遍
Say it for me one time.

292
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:45,159
你  让让让...让我快乐
- you make me happy. - make me happy.

293
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,856
-我爱你  伙计  -好吧  再见
- I love you, buddy. - all right, bye.

294
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,757
紧急会议?  什么意思?
Crisis meeting? what does that mean, exactly?

295
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,529
我们出了什么紧急情况吗?
I mean, are we in a crisis?

296
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,161
他是制片厂的老大
He's the head of the studio.

297
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,638
我们在一万英里之外
He's reaching out. we're 10,000 miles away.

298
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,833
他就想来个小会面
He just wants a little face-time.

299
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,536
是你说他称这个为紧急会议  所以我...
I know, it's just you said that he called it a crisis meeting. so...

300
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,045
他是莱斯・葛罗斯曼  最喜欢用这种夸张的形容词
It's Les Grossman. he throws these words around.

301
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:06,550
"危急关头"  "轰天爆炸"  "晕头转向"  "后院起火"这些
"crisis," "explosion," "not rolling," "fired."

302
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,983
就只是定语而已  毫无意义
These are just words.

303
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,588
以下保密  一辆摄影车被朱迪・戴区拉去做苦力了
Keep a secret? a camera truck in london just plowed into Judi Dench.

304
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:14,818
相信我  他麻烦大了
Trust me, he's got bigger problems.

305
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,395
他可能看得见我  但我可看不见他
Look, he may be able to see me, but I can't see him.

306
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:22,024
-闪开闪开  莱斯先生  -把你的大屁股抬开
- move! move! hello, Les! hello! - get your ass out of my...

307
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,567
-你的脚在我桌子上  -他看得见我们了吗?
- your feet were on my desk. - can he see us?

308
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,000
我就不明白为什么我们...
I don't know why we don't have...

309
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,265
给他一罐低脂可乐  莱斯  好用了!
Get him a diet coke. Les! it's working!

310
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,863
好了  停  你好  莱斯!
Yeah, whatever you're doing right there. hello, Les!

311
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,374
-你好  莱斯!  -好了
- hello, Les! - okay.

312
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,536
我们听得很清楚  莱斯
We got you loud and clear here, Les.

313
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:37,342
看见了  我看见你们了
I see you. I see you. I see you.

314
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,577
那个蠢脸是TM的达米安・考克本?
Which one of you fuckfaces is Damien Cockburn?

315
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,111
不才在下我  先生
That's me, sir.

316
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:46,749
真高兴见到你  来个小"会面"
It's good to finally meet you at last, get some face-time.

317
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:50,818
哪个是道具长  你?  你
And who here is the key grip? you? you.

318
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:56,289
你给我狠狠的揍那个导演的大饼脸
Hit that director in the face, really fucking hard.

319
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,473
得罪了
Sorry, man.

320
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,384
这都是你的错  你个英国来的傻×
This is your fault, you limey fuck!

321
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,511
你把我的钱当啥了?
You shit the money-bed, my friend.

322
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,352
嘿  莱斯  我能理解你很生气
Hey, Les, I understand if you're angry,

323
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,449
不过我这儿可伺候着一班太上皇呢!
But I am dealing with a bunch of prima donnas!

324
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,052
都是他  塔格・斯比德曼  他哭不出来!
Clowns! Tugg Speedman, he can't cry! he can't cry!

325
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,564
你知道怎么控制好演员?  他们一抱怨
You know how you handle an actor? they whine about anything,

326
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,965
把他们裤子脱了  抽一鞭子
You pull down their pants and you spank their ass.

327
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,264
-抽他们  莱斯  -什么?
- you spank that ass, Les. - what?

328
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:37,138
抽他们只会把他们搞成可怜虫
Spanking a child turns him into a little snot.

329
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,911
恐惧才会让人成长
Fear makes him a man.

330
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:46,543
我知道有个地方  能真正考验男人的价值
I know a place where a man's worth is measured

331
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:50,452
颈上的狗牌(军人颈上的金属牌)
In the ears hanging from his dog tags.

332
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,286
真正的东西
The real deep shit.

333
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,986
你要拍的逼真?
You wanna make this movie right?

334
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:59,586
你就得带着你的小娘娘腔们  去那儿体验一下
That's where you take your pansy-ass actors.

335
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,031
他又是谁?
Who is this guy?

336
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,035
莱斯  这是福尔・立夫
Les, that's Four Leaf.

337
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:08,436
福尔・立夫・泰柏克上士  是我写了那本书
Sergeant Four Leaf Tayback. I wrote the book.

338
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:14,703
你是美国的勇士  国家欠了你的
You're a great american. this nation owes you a huge debt.

339
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,782
不过现在请勿开尊口打扰我工作!
Now shut the fuck up and let me do my job!

340
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,117
-听着  考克本  -是
- look, Cockburn. - yes.

341
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:24,246
从现在开始  我的拳头离你的肛门就不远了
From now on, my fist is gonna be so far up your shithole

342
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,721
你一有了什么奇思妙想
That every time you have a thought,

343
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,850
就得问问我的结婚戒指答不答应
It's gonna have to tiptoe past my wedding ring.

344
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:32,488
管好你的演员  否则我就让你停拍
Take control of your actors, or I will shut you down.

345
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,690
我的低脂可乐呢!
Diet coke!

346
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,974
当羊群迷路时
When the herd loses its way,

347
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:53,518
牧羊人就会杀了带领它们迷路的领头羊
The shepherd must kill the bull that leads them astray.

348
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:58,619
-福尔・立夫?  -过来吧  别怕
- Four Leaf? - come on over. it's okay.

349
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,782
-坐下吧  -是
- sit down. - yes.

350
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:08,292
-你不喜欢旅馆的房间?  -席梦思让我做恶梦
- so, you don't like the hotel? - beds give me nightmares.

351
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:18,537
我猜对了  你用一艘俄亥俄的渔船
I'm guessing right about now you couldn't find a dixie coonskin

352
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:22,978
是找不到浣熊皮做的行军大铁锅的
With an ohio hooker holding your prick and showing you the way.

353
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,119
什么?
What?

354
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:35,159
我的故事交到了你这个英国佬的手上
I put my story in your limp brit hands,

355
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,696
你可不能让我失望
And you are not going to fail me.

356
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:42,392
你以为我在会议上那是虚张声势?
You think I was just blowing my own bagpipe in that meeting?

357
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:46,335
你必须带着那帮孩子到那儿去!
You must put those boys in the shit.

358
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:47,996
什么?  我没明白
What? I don't understand.

359
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:51,371
-你还想搞好你的电影吗?  -当然了
- you wanna make your movie or not? - yes, I do.

360
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,968
那好  你就带着你那些小摄像机
All right, you get some of those little video type cameras.

361
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,709
带到丛林那儿  放置在不同的角落
We take them out there, and we put them in the trees in different angles.

362
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:02,116
然后你把所有的烟幕弹  冲锋枪  炸药  雷管
Then you give me and that pyromaniac Cody

363
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,089
都给我和负责爆破的科迪
All the smoke bombs, charges, explosives, detonators you got.

364
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:09,626
然后带那些演员去那儿
Then we take those boys up there,

365
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:12,822
我和科迪  会炸了那个丛林
Me and Cody, we could light up that fucking jungle,

366
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:15,866
那些小娘娘腔演员会吓得屁滚尿流
So those lily-dick actors would be shitting their pants

367
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,958
吓得尖声叫妈
And screaming for their mammies.

368
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,528
他们宁愿被卷在裹尸布里面如果可以回家
They'd be begging for a body bag if it means a ride home.

369
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:25,900
我可以这么干
I could do it.

370
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:30,114
我可以把一切弄成游击式的  风沙  泥土
I could shoot the whole thing guerrilla style. gritty, dirty.

371
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:33,548
把他们和那些奶妈似的的助手保姆们隔离开
Get them away from their helpers and ass-licking assistants.

372
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:34,744
让他们处在真实的战争环境中
Put them in the real shit.

373
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,047
-真实环境  -要从他们的眼中看到真正的恐惧!
- real shit. - with real fear in their eyes!

374
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:39,214
真正的恐惧  真实的感情!  福尔・立夫  太好了!
Real fear, real emotion! yes, Four Leaf, yes!

375
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,417
-就这么干  -对  就这么干!
- yes! yes! - yes! yes!

376
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,289
让他们身处绝境
Take them off the fucking grid!

377
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,510
你们不再是电影演员
You are no longer actors in a movie!

378
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:07,346
你们就是直升机里的五个军人
You are five men in a helicopter!

379
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,884
还有三个陌生人:我们
With three other men!

380
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,052
那我们什么时候能回去?
How long are we gonna be gone, anyways?

381
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:22,224
我的大部分维他命都留在旅馆里了
'cause I left most of my vitamins back at the hotel.

382
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,894

387
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,371
我们地狱见
See you in hell!

388
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:21,086
这什么狗屁情况  我最少得打个电话告诉我助手吧
This is bullshit! I gotta at least call my fucking assistant.

389
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,090
日!  伙计你TMD干嘛!

You're sitting on a nest of hostile enemy v.c.

祝贺你  死胖子  你把我们都害死了
Congratulations, fats. you just got us all killed.

392
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:36,933
谁还想泄漏我们的行踪给那群傻瓜助手的?
Anybody else care to give away our position to Charlie?

393
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,805
把手机都交出来!
Cell phones!

394
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,377
达米安  这是TM怎么回事?
What the hell, Damien?

395
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:44,176
69年可没有手机  我从头到脚标准配备
Weren't no cell phones in '69, man. I'm head-to-toe legitimate.

396
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:47,683
同志们  我这儿有好消息和坏消息
Gentlemen, I've got good news and bad news.

397
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:51,278

Your objective is to head north to the D'ang Kwook River

401
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,189
解放战俘营
And liberate the pow camp,

402
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,565
也就是福尔・立夫会让自己被抓到的地方
At which point Four Leaf will get himself captured,

403
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,467
你们要去营救他

404
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:10,939
然后直升机会送你们回家

405
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,142
福尔・立夫  既然你是上士

406
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,647
这是地图  这是场景名单
There's the map, this is the scene list.

407
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:19,876
你们可以搞定吗?

408
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:24,183
我们在这整个死亡之谷布满了隐藏摄像机
We have rigged this entire valley of death with hidden cameras.

409
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:29,286
我也会在镜头外亲自拍摄
And I will be shooting as well, from unseen vantage points,

410
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:32,989
所以每一个辉煌的时刻都会被电影记录在册
So that every glorious moment is captured on film.

And believe me, gentlemen, it will be glorious.

你们想成为演员

414
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,467
你们想披起别人的皮演好戏
You wanted to occupy the skin of another human being.

415
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:47,568
准备好披上被吓倒的美国步兵连的画皮
Well, get ready to occupy the skin of a terrified u.s. infantry grunt,

416
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,445
死亡无处不在  撒旦近在咫尺
Surrounded by death, crawling up satan's bottom.

417
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:57,183
会有埋伏  敌军开火  你们自己的各种障碍
There'll be ambushes, enemy fire, your own little personal slice of 'nam.

418
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:01,885
这个步话机只能和直升机通信
This radio goes to the chopper and the chopper only.

419
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:06,396
直升机就是上帝  而我是上帝之子  耶和华
The chopper is god, and I am jesus christ, his son.

420
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:09,227
你们是我挑选的信徒
You are my chosen disciples.

421
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:12,360
我们没有完成目标之前  谁都回不了家
And no one gets to go home till we get the shots.

422
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,496
换上你们的战争画皮  伙计们
Put on your war faces, gentlemen.

423
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:20,306
我们一起创造这前所未有精彩绝伦的战争电影
Now, let's go and make the greatest war movie ever!

424
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,744
-好的  -没错!

425
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,520

不管你在哪儿

不管他在哪儿?  看来他到处都是啊
Wherever he is? looks like he's all over the place.

429
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,762
这肯定是个老旧的法式地雷
Must be an old french mine.

430
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:24,330
是印度和中国殖民的残留  这个丛林里肯定到处都是
It's a remnant from colonial indo-china. this jungle must be full of them.

431
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:29,869
你们还不明白吗?  他在玩心理战
Don't you get it? he's messing with our heads.

432
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,006
这就是为什么他一直在扮神
That's what all that playing god stuff was about.

433
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,677
他在试着让我们演好点  拯救这部电影
He's trying to get us to act good, save the movie.

434
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:37,812
他不是在扮神  他是被神裁决了
He ain't playing god. he's being judged by him.

435
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,522
这就是我们的目标  完成任务
That's our objective. complete the mission.

No offense, Kirk, I know you're the big fancy actor here,

437
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:57,640
不过我可比你拍了更多的效果电影
But I've done a lot more effects-driven event films than you. okay?

438
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,141
我可以认出
And I think I can spot

439
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,770
死人头的道具
A prop head when I see one.

440
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:09,075
这就是玉米糖浆而已  玉米糖浆和乳胶
It's corn syrup, guys. corn syrup and latex.

441

温暖的  带着血液味道的玉米糖浆
Warm, blood-flavored corn syrup.

你们要完成目标
You're going to get the shots,

447
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,036
我要监督你们  因为我是导演
And I'm going to make sure because I'm the director.

448
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:38,274
我来自伦敦  我导演戏剧
I'm from london. I direct plays.

449
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,409
嘿  达米安  我们已经换上军人画皮了
Hey, Damien! we got our war faces on!

450
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:52,991

让这些年轻人长长见识
Blow some sense into these young men.

453
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:11,347
我不想搞得很尴尬
Hey, I don't want to come off as weird or anything,

454
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:15,385
但我或许可以算是你的粉丝团团长了
But I might be your biggest fan. yeah.

455

Tropic thunder. kind of like my catcher in the rye.

456
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,723
虽然我本身从未在军队呆过
Yeah, I've never been in the military, per se,

457
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,262
不过我在工作中丢了一只手指
But I have lost an appendage in the line of duty.

458
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,296
驾驶首架摄影用马车的时候

我不知道它是什么
I don't know what it's called.

461

我只知道当它取走人的性命时的声音
I just know the sound it makes when it takes a man's life.

462
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,275

This is fubar. I say we juice them.

508
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,342
-你觉得怎样?  -后援
- what do you think? - juice them.

509
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:41,247
干你的  查理
Fuck you, Charlie!

510
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:44,795
让你爽歪歪
Big-ass titties!

511
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:52,395
你看看
Look at that, huh?

512
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:58,869
停止拍摄
And cut!

513
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,976
够做宣传片用了
That's the trailer right there.

514
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,746
-现在干什么  -耶
- what do we do now? - yeah.

515
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:08,375
向北  他说向北走
North. man said to head north.

516
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,819
-看到我狂射了么  -就那样  很好
- did you see me shooting? - that's how we do. good work, baby.

517
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:12,981
我还真信了
I believed it.

518
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:14,251
当库河
D'ang kwook river.

519
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:16,291
我打赌一路上还会有更多
I'm betting he's got more of these battles

520
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:19,124
和越共佬打斗的场面
And viet congs rigged for us along the way.

521
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,996
奥西里斯上士  让你的人上弹拉好保险
Sergeant Osiris, get your men. load and lock.

522
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,431
真的  宝贝  我说真的
Real, baby, I'm real.

523
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,302
出发  前面的仗还多着呢
Let's go! we got a lot of klicks to cover!

524
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,467
男士们  动起来  排成一队
Hump it up, gentlemen! single formation.

525
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,409
别游手好闲了
Don't dawdle now!

526
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:03,803
D棒  D棒  这是布丁脸  情况如何了
D-rod, d-rod, this is puddingface. how are we coming on that hotplate?

527
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:09,743
出事了  我认为我们得去看看
Something's up. I think we better drag ass back there.

528
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:12,543
确认下达米安还没忘怎么用对话器
Make sure Damien ain't forgot how to use his talkbox again.

529
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:23,260
宝儿  来一点就好
Yeah, baby, come on. just a little taste.

530
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:26,989
-杰夫  干嘛呢?  -我日  没什么
- what are you doing, Jeff? - fucking... nothing, man!

531
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:30,431
-吃软糖呢  -哇  我也喜欢  能给点给我...
- I'm eating jellybeans. - wow, I love jellybeans. can I please...

532
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:33,265
不行  门儿都没有
No, you can't have any fucking jellybeans.

533
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:34,463
都是我的
They're mine.

534
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,732
你觉得你是这儿唯一一个没软糖
You think you're the only one who gets sick

535
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,535
就要生病的人?
When he doesn't have his jellybeans?

536
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,041
原则问题  日
Boundaries, man. fuck.

537
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:01,659
嘿  之前我并不是找你茬
Hey. I didn't mean to show you up back there.

538
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,777
只是我觉得我们得
It's just, I feel like we really need

539
00:35:03,778 --> 00:35:05,896
给其他人树立榜样
To set the example for the other guys

540
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,903
会挺艰难
It's gonna be tough,

541
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:11,031
但我认为达米安一定能拍到很赞的画面
But I think Damien's gonna get some great shit out of us.

542
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,306
多希望当时拍杰克的时也有个这样的导演
Just wish I had a director like this on Jack.

543
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,903
拍什么杰克?  你在说什么
On Jack. what? Jack? what you talking about?

544
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,084
-笨蛋杰克  -哦  对
- simple Jack. - oh, yeah.

545
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:24,817
笨蛋杰克  你全力以赴的吧
Simple Jack, yeah. you went all out on that one, huh?

546
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:27,186
真的  打全垒打了  对吧
You did. really swung for the fences, huh?

547
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,691
谢谢  谢了
Thank you. thanks. yeah.

548
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,695
没错  是次很深刻的经历
Yeah, it was an intense experience, you know.

549
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,490
下了很多功夫
I just did the work.

550
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,400
观看一群弱智的人  花时间观察他们
Watched a lot of retarded people. spent time with them. observed them.

551
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,866
观看他们做的弱智事情
Watched all the retarded stuff they did.

552
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,737
而我总是觉得对它的观察
Then again, I always found mere observation

553
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:47,140
是很细小基础的东西
In and of itself is a tad rudimentary.

554
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:50,305
有时  我们得更深入的找寻内心情感
Sometimes, we gotta dig deeper to mine the true emotional pay dirt.

555
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:54,748
从而才能分析痛苦的来源  才能与之共存
Thus, we can diagram the source of the pain and then live it, you know.

556
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:56,911
对  对  与之共存  没错
Yeah, yeah, live it. yeah, exactly.

557
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:59,751
你知道么  当我在拍杰克的时候
You know, there were times when I was doing Jack

558
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:02,325
有时我真感觉自己弱智
That I actually felt retarded,

559
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:03,694
-真正的弱智  -妈的
- like really retarded. - damn.

560
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:04,319
-真正的弱智  -妈的
- like really retarded. - damn.

561
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:07,659
我要以奇怪的方式释放自己
In a weird way, I had to sort of just free myself up

562
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:10,734
安慰自己愚蠢智障没什么
To believe that it was okay to be stupid or dumb.

563
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,393
-当个低能儿  -对
- to be a moron. - yeah.

564
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:15,233

-痴呆儿  -对
- an imbecile. - yeah.

566
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:19,674
-像是有史以来最傻的白痴
Like the dumbest motherfucker that ever lived.

567
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:20,937
当我扮演这个角色的时候
When I was playing the character.

568
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:23,639
-当你进入这个角色时  -对  完全进入杰克
- when you was the character. - yeah, as Jack, definitely.

569
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,978
杰克  傻X的杰克
Jack, stupid ass Jack.

570
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,812
当结束拍摄使  我在想
By the end of the whole thing, I was like,

571
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,154
等一下  我入戏太深了
"wait a minute, I flushed so much out,

572
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:32,447
我该怎么重新回到生活
How am I gonna jumpstart it up again?

573
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:34,616
-感觉很...对吧  -对
- it's just like... right? - yeah.

574
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:37,489
你在浴缸里放屁  笑掉大牙
You was farting in bathtubs and laughing your ass off.

575
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:40,063
对  我是说  这太疯狂了
Yeah. I mean, it was really quite a... it was crazy.

576
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:43,656
兄弟  是高科技  一种艺术形式
It's like working with mercury. it's high science, man. it's an art form.

577
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,793
-对  -你是个艺术家
- yeah. - you an artist.

578
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,700
-这不就是我们干的么  -对
- that's what we do, right? yeah. - yeah.

579
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:49,067
向做到这样脱帽敬礼
Hats off for going there,

580
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,903
特别是知道奥斯卡是怎么回事的人
Especially knowing how the academy is about that shit.

581
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:59,140
-什么东西  -你当真不知道?
- about what? - you're serious? you don't know?

582
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,377
是人都知道不能变成彻底的弱智
Everybody knows you never go full retard.

583
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:07,015
-什么意思  -你听听看
- what do you mean? - check it out.

584
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:11,254
达斯汀・霍夫曼主演雨人  看着弱智  表演弱智  但他不弱智
Dustin hoffman, rain man, looked retarded, act retarded, not retarded.

585
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:15,458
数牙签  纸牌作弊  自闭  但不弱智
Count toothpicks, cheat at cards. autistic, sure. not retarded.

586
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,199
再来看汤姆・汉克斯  主演了阿甘正传
Then you got tom hanks, forrest gump.

587
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,600
迟钝没错  也许有点弱智  腿上装着矫正器
Slow, yes, retarded, maybe, braces on his legs.

588
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,606
但他征服了尼克松总统  赢了乒乓球比赛
But he charmed the pants off nixon, and he won a ping-pong competition.

589
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:24,902
那当然不弱智
That ain't retarded.

590
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,002
彼得・塞勒斯  也一样  幼稚但不弱智
Peter sellers, being there. infantile, yes. retarded, no.

591
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,739
而你则从头到尾彻底智障了
You went full retard, man.

592
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,450
千万别彻底智障
Never go full retard.

593
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:40,015
你不信?  去问演《我是山姆》的西恩・潘
You don't buy that? ask sean penn, 2001, I am sam.

00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,850
闻起来像博洛尼亚香肠
That smelled just like bologna for some reason.

633
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:23,476
有他妈人来帮我抓这该死的东西么
Is anyone gonna fucking help me get this fucking thing?

634
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,748
他们怎么白天都出来了
Why are they even out in the daytime?

635
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:33,396
我得跟你说实话  兄弟  我不尿就是跟你谈谈
I'm gonna level with you, bro. I don't need to pee. I need to talk to you.

636
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:43,403
拉扎勒斯要把这电影搅黄
Lazarus is gonna torpedo the movie.

637
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,338
他有点偏离现在这个角色了
He's way out on a limb with this character,

638
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,276
我觉得他临阵畏缩
And I think he's getting cold feet.

639
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:54,172
-我需要你站在我这边凯尔  -我叫凯文
- I need you on my side, Kyle. - it's Kevin.

640
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,446
很好  靠得住你么
Good. can I count on you?

641
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:01,492
如果可以  我能看看那地图
Yeah. if you want I could give the map a look-see.

642
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,720
-地图我来弄  -好的
- I'll handle the map. - okay.

643
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:07,059
我们按计划  就能完成电影拍摄
You stick with the program, we get this movie in the can,

644
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:10,861
我觉得你能获得年轻人选择奖
I'm thinking there could be a teen choice award in it for you.

645
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:15,166
你有潜质  他们会捧你的
You have that potential. they'll slime you, the whole deal.

646
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:18,901
-好  那太棒了  -好的
- yeah, that's wicked. - good.

647
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,908
这儿  现在死了吧
There it is! yeah, now you're dead!

648
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,313
你这该死的
You o.d.'d!

649
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,219
杰夫  等等
Hold up now, Jeff.

650
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,721
你干什么  杰夫  只是只蝙蝠
What the hell, Jeff? that's a bat, man!

651
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,299
我没软糖了
I don't have any more jellybeans.

652
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,704
在那里降落
You land there!

653
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:09,024
哇  悄悄这片废墟
Wow. look at these ruins.

654
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:15,632
-我们在哪儿  -当库河
- where the hell are we? - D'ang Kwook River.

655
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:18,099
是么  你怎么知道  你确定?
That so? how do you know that? how you sure?

656
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,397
只有走了才知道  老兄  出发
Only one way to find out, dude. let's go.

657
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:25,601
我感觉不对  真的  皮肤痛
Yeah. I'm not feeling so good right now. seriously, my skin hurts!

658
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,143
别在上面了  到水下来  娘们
Enough from the peanut gallery! into the water, ladies!

659
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,372
别  让我看看地图
No, man. let me take a look at that map right quick.

660
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,073
怎么大家都对地图着迷
Why is everybody all obsessed with the map?

661
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:34,207
因为我们厌倦了当你的跟班
'cause we're tired of being your trail donkeys!

662
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:36,718
演得跟你是个真人GPS似的
Acting like you some one-man gps!

663
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:40,688
操娘的  我们迷路了  彻底迷路了
God damn it! we lost! we fucking super lost, man!

664
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,918
麦克拉斯基告诉他  现在几点了
Tell him, Mcclusky. tell him what time it is.

665
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,585
真不敢相信你们这些人
I don't believe you people.

666
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,025
你说"你们这些人"是什么意思
What do you mean "you people"?

667
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:53,295
你说"你们这些人"是什么意思
What do you mean, "you people"?

668
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,395
我觉得塔格的意思是...
I think what Tugg means is...

669
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:56,871
不  看着他的眼睛
No, look at his eyes, man.

670
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,322
...你们这些人  你们这些演员...
...you people, you actors. you people...

671
00:42:58,323 --> 00:42:59,670
-看着眼珠子  -白种眼珠子
- look at them beady, white devil eyes

672
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,335
我要回到酒店  说真的
I gotta get back to the hotel, for real!

673
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,413
-停下来  -安静
- hell, no! - silence!

674
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:07,110
冷静点  好么  冷静下来
Chill! all right? just chill it.

675
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,816
我们去打越共佬佬
Now, let's go get those viet congs.

676
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:14,214
-"越共佬"  -什么
- "viet cong"! - what?

677
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:17,751
是"越共佬"  不用复数  本来就是了
It's "viet cong." there's no "s." it's already plural.

678
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,453
就像你不说中国人人
You wouldn't say "chineses."

679
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:23,265
够了  这场反抗够了
All right, that's enough of this insubordination!

680
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:26,165
如果组织散了  我们也就散了
If the machine breaks down, we break down.

681
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,795
嘿  你知道在第一滴血第一部里  他只是个肥猪
Hey, man, you know how in rambo i, he was big but a little puffy

682
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:30,498
在第一滴血第二部中  就满身肌肉了
And then rambo ii, he got all shredded up?

683
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,475
-对  -你现在就这样
- yeah. - that's kind of how you look right now.

684
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:35,135
-对  -不是第一部  是第二部
- yeah? - not rambo I but ii.

685
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:36,974
-真的?  -对当他塑身后
- really? - yeah, when he was cut up.

686
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:39,447
我倒没有...我是说  那是目标  但现在...
I'm not that... I mean, that's what I'm going for, but you know...

687
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,246
得了  兄弟  你比切条沙拉还有型
Come on, dude. you more shredded than a julienne salad, man.

688
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:43,843
-谢谢  -秘方是什么
- thanks. - what's the secret, dude?

689
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,319
-饮食  我控制饮食  -真的?
- it's a diet. I'm just dieting. - really?

690
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:48,414
因为我也想...但太难了
'cause I'm trying to come up a little, but it's just... it's tough.

691
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:50,015
-你看上去不错  -有小提示么
- you look good. - any tips?

692
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,822
-什么?  -提示  你有么
- what? - any tips, you got?

693
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,055
像比如菠萝
There's, like, the pineapple...

694
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:55,461
-把地图给我  我日  -嘿
- give me that goddamn map! fuck you! - hey!

695
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,158
-嘿  -好了
- hey! - all right, now!

696
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,701
这是什么  斯奥斯奇  告诉我们的位置
What it is, Sikorski? tell us where we really at.

697
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,794
真他妈鬼扯  这烂招都用
That's fucking bullshit! it's a chump move.

698
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:03,839
我们只是想听听另外的意见
We just getting a second opinion, doc.

699
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:06,938
我们走错路了
We're going the wrong way!

700
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:08,136
-操  -狗娘养的
- damn! - son of a bitch.

701
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:12,705
天  我认为我们该这样
God! I think we were supposed to be doing this,

702
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,717
但却这样了
And instead we did this.

703
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:22,081
你觉得能带我们会降落点?
Think you can get us back to that drop zone, boy?

704
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:24,426
太不爽了
This is not cool!

705
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:28,257
也许吧
Maybe.

706
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,190
太胡闹了
This is insane!

707
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:34,801
你们真打算放弃电影?
Are you really going to abandon this movie?

708
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:37,801
我们本该是个连队
We're supposed to be a unit!

709
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:39,432
滚他妈的连队
Suck my unit!

710
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,107
好吧  行
All right, fine.

711
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:47,115
-我自己完成  -你爱咋咋地
- I'll finish it by myself. - you go be all you can be, man.

712
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:49,208
-塔格  你不知道你要走向何方
Tugg, you have no idea where you're going!

713
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,116
我知道
Yes, I do!

714
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:55,749
我要  "在黄昏中走到外部雨林"
I'm going to, "exterior, rain forest, dusk.

715
00:44:55,859 --> 00:45:00,319
"独自一人穿过恐惧的丛林  突然转向福尔・立夫"
"smash cut to Four Leaf, who treks alone through a frightening jungle."

716
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:02,365
去你的连队
Suck on that unit, Kirk!

717
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:18,938
行了  兄弟们  我们回家
Come on, men. let's get home.

718
00:45:57,121 --> 00:46:01,785
你好螳螂  你很漂亮
Hello, mr. mantis. you're beautiful.

719
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,995
现在如果回想起之前的喧嚣
Now, if you recall that whole hullabaloo

720
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,825
当时好莱坞分为2阵营
Where hollywood was split into schisms,

721
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:11,332
一些厂牌支持蓝光  另外的支持HD-DVD
Some studios backing blu-ray disc, others backing hd dvd.

722
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,527
人们认为最后是
People thought it would come down to

723
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:14,900
像素速率和刷新率之争  但其实都一样
Pixel rate or refresh rate, and they're pretty much the same.

724
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:18,805
真正决定权在游戏和色情的发行上
What it came down to was a combination of gamers and porn.

725
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,638
只要色情电影支持哪种格式
Now, whichever format porno backs

726
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:24,578
一般就是最后流行的格式
Is usually the one that becomes the most successful.

727
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:27,673
你知道索尼的PS3配有蓝光光驱
But, you know, sony, every playstation 3 has a blu-ray in it.

728
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,514
你一直在跟我讲话?
You talking to me this whole time?

729
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:31,551
我在跟听的人讲话
I was talking to whoever was listening to me.

730
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:53,601
"超级能量"
Booty sweat.

731
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:07,849
冷  太冷了  真他妈冷
It's cold! it's freezing. I'm fucking cold.

732
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,493
你要我的防弹衣么
You want my flak Jacket?

733
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:10,152
你要我的防弹衣么
You want my flak Jacket?

734
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:14,128
你疯了么  这么热  像蒸桑拿似的
What, are you insane? it's boiling! it's like a sweat lodge out here!

735
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:17,064
吵架声音小点  
Keep the volume down on that bitching, flatch adams.

736
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,067
我背着12磅的东西呢
I gotta take a fucking 12-pound shit!

737
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,137
-怎样了  情况不错?  -是不错
- how we doing? we making good time? - we're making good time,

738
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:24,366
但要想在天黑前翻过那座山是不可能的
But there's no way we make it over that ridge before sundown.

739
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,965
好吧  伙计们  我们扎帐篷休息
All right, fellas, we're gonna make camp, rest up!

740
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:29,375
-天啊  -你们可占便宜了
- oh, god. - y'all might be in for a treat.

741
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:30,878
当初战争爆发时
You know, back before the war broked out,

742
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:33,711
我曾在圣安东尼奥服兵役
I was a saucier in san antone.

743
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:36,445
我打赌能将一些藏匿的人揪出来
I bet I could collar up some of them greens.

744
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:40,853
就像在稻田里捉小虾一样
Yeah, noodle some crawfish out the paddy, yo.

745
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:44,985
再弄点酸苹果当甜点  明白吗  当然!
And maybe some crab apples for dessert, now, you hear? hell, yeah!

746
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:51,896
那就是我们说话的方式  像这样
That's how we all talk. we all talk like this, suh! yes, suh.

747
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:57,235
是的  在稻田里捉小虾
Yeah, get some crawfish and some ribs.

748
00:47:57,341 --> 00:48:02,210
是澳大利亚人就好好做那里人!  懂吗  "袋鼠杰克"
You're australian! be australian! excuse me, kangaroo Jack.

749
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,850
伙计  我一想到食物就会激动
I get excited about my foods, man.

750
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,069
去死吧!
Die!

751
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,914
不!
No!

752
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:03,763
伙计  究竟发生什么了?  我们在哪儿?
Dude, dude, what the hell is going on here? where are we?

753
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:06,267
我也不知道
I have no idea.

754
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,930
我从未出过美国
I've never been outside the states.

755
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:11,200
什么?  你他妈是在开玩笑吗
Wait, what? are you fucking kidding me?

756
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:13,299
这一切都他妈是你编造的吗
Did you make this whole goddamn thing up?

757
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,775
伙计  难道你甚至都没参过军?
Dude, were you even in the fucking service?

758
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:17,540
我当然参过军  不过是海岸巡逻队  
Yes. of course. coast guard.

759
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:19,547
-海岸巡逻队  -公共卫生部门
- coast guard. - sanitation department.

760
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:22,345
上帝啊  你他妈只是个拣垃圾的!
Oh, my god! you're a fucking garbage man!

761
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:26,183
妈的  F・L・泰柏克骗了我和整个美国
Damn it. F.L. Tayback lies to me and the whole goddamn u.s. of a.

762
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:28,951
那本书是对国家的贡献!  我是个爱国者!
I wrote the book as a tribute! I'm a patriot!

763
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:31,118
好的  就算你有微乎其微的爱国情结  
Yeah, you're the milli vanilli of patriots, okay?

764
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:32,923
你骗了所有人说自己在越南战争上战斗
You lied about fighting the vietnam war.

765
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,295
就像用国旗蒙住世人的脸一样  该死
It's like punching the american flag in the face, god damn it.

766
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,833
上帝啊  我居然还相信了你!
God, and to think I believed in you!

767
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:40,300
-真不愿和你呆一起  -作家总是在欺骗
- I don't wanna be next to you. - writers lie all the time.

768
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:42,531
可以把我和别人绑一块吗
Can I be tied to another post? okay.

769
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:05,992
-瑞克?  -塔格  
- Rick? - Tugg.

770
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:08,155
我杀生了  瑞克
I killed one, Rick.

771
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:11,699
杀了我世间的最爱
The thing I love most in the world.

772
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:13,633
维薇卡  挂掉电话  马上!
Vivica, get off the line now!

773
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:18,339
是个妓女吧  你杀了个妓女
A hooker. all right, you killed a hooker.

774
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:20,501
冷静  你现在要做的是
Calm down. here's what you're gonna do.

775
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:21,770
在手上抹一些漂白粉
Get your hands on some bleach,

776
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:24,244
一些过氧化氢和石灰粉

不  是只熊猫

我杀了只熊猫
I killed a panda.

779
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:29,615
阿曼达?  听着  伙计
Amanda? come on, dude.

780
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:31,744
我是说  那也许都不是她的真名
I mean, that's probably not even her real name.

781
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:33,516
不  是只熊猫
No, a panda!

782
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:34,988
一只熊猫?
A panda?

783
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,686
一只可爱的
A sweet, cuddly,

784
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:39,728
"行为不轨"的小熊猫
Vicious little panda.

785
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:42,798
上帝啊  塔格!  别那样吓我!  
Jesus christ, Tugg! man, don't scare me like that!

786
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:44,059
这儿很美
It's beautiful here.

787
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:45,657
你在拍摄点?
You on the set?

788
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,031
我是在这儿
I am the set.

789
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:50,106
好的  伙计  数码录影机好用吗  
All right, man. hey, how's the tivo working out?

790
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:51,435
别提那玩意了
Screw tivo.

791
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:54,009
我早就不需要了
I'm way beyond tivo.

792
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,204
上次看过  压根没弄好
Last I checked, they hadn't hooked it up, though.

793
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:59,612
没有?  没有数码录像机?
Hadn't hooked it up? no tivo?

794
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:01,547
已经没有关系了
It doesn't matter anymore.

795
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:05,854
我已经离开了
I've moved on.

796
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:08,319
你离开去哪?
Where have you moved on to?

797
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:09,585
另一家经纪公司?
Another agency?

798
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:12,589
你和谁在一起?
Hey, who is with you?

799
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:16,792
你还是我的客户  塔格・斯比德曼!  我要拿到数码录像机!  
You are still my client, Tugg Speedman! I am getting the tivo!

800
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,095
穿上夹克  我出门了!
Jacket's on, I'm out the door!

801
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:20,260
塔格?
Tugg?

802
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:23,862
拜托别炒我鱿鱼
Please don't fire me.

803
00:52:27,408 --> 00:52:30,309
妈妈  好渴啊
Oh, mama. thirsty.

804
00:52:30,444 --> 00:52:32,503
他看起来不好
He doesn't look too good.

805
00:52:32,613 --> 00:52:37,641
我必须喝点什么  才能吐得出来
Must drink, so I can throw something up!

806
00:52:37,751 --> 00:52:39,878
别喝那水!  那水看上去就像细菌培养液
No, no. don't drink that water! that water's like a petri dish!

807
00:52:39,987 --> 00:52:41,079
不要!
No, don't!

808
00:52:41,188 --> 00:52:43,713
阿帕  你还有"超级能量"吗
Alpa, do you have any Booty Sweat?

809
00:52:43,824 --> 00:52:46,190
让他多喝点阿帕的狗屁饮料吧
Yeah, get him chugging on some of Alpa's ass water.

810
00:52:46,293 --> 00:52:48,227
能让他清醒过来的灵丹妙药
That'll bring him around. it's a cure-all.

811
00:52:48,329 --> 00:52:50,229
伙计  你来拍这部片子究竟是为了什么
Man, what you coming out in movies for anyway?

812
00:52:50,331 --> 00:52:51,992
你还需要额外经济来源吗
Did you need another revenue stream?

813
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:54,897
想要知道我的经济来源吗
For your information, my revenue stream

814
00:52:55,002 --> 00:52:57,334
我每年获利200万美元
Currently generates $2 million a year

815
00:52:57,438 --> 00:52:59,372
均用来作为我公司的慈善捐款
In charitable contributions for my community.

816
00:52:59,473 --> 00:53:01,805
-真够火的  -为什么我会来拍这部电影?
- hot damn. - and why am I in this movie?

817
00:53:01,909 --> 00:53:04,241
也许因为我知道我不得不出演
Maybe I just knew I had to represent,

818
00:53:04,345 --> 00:53:06,142
因为这部电影有一个"黑人"的好角色
Because they had one good part in it for a black man

819
00:53:06,246 --> 00:53:08,305
他们却把角色给了"鳄鱼邓迪"
And they gave it to crocodile dundee.

820
00:53:09,917 --> 00:53:13,478
管好你的嘴  孩子  他可是国宝级人物
Pump your brakes, kid. that man is a national treasure.

821
00:53:13,587 --> 00:53:15,714
我只是想在你的烤肉里加点作料
I just wanted to throw another shrimp on your barbie.

822
00:53:15,823 --> 00:53:16,949
这可不好笑
That shit ain't funny.

823
00:53:17,057 --> 00:53:19,753
伙计们  这又热又臭  我们又累
Hey, fellas! it's hot! we're tired! it stinks!

824
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,418
我只是在和你开玩笑  袋鼠杰克
I'm just fucking with you, kangaroo Jack!

825
00:53:21,528 --> 00:53:23,257
真抱歉一只澳洲犬吃了你的孩子
I'm sorry a dingo ate your baby.

826
00:53:23,364 --> 00:53:25,832
知道真有那回事吗  一位女士失去了孩子
You know that's a true story? lady lost her kid.

827
00:53:25,933 --> 00:53:28,595
-你有点太过分了  -伙计们  冷静点
- you about to cross some fucking lines. - guys, relax and stuff.

828
00:53:28,702 --> 00:53:29,760
你他妈去死吧
You know what? fuck that, man!

829
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:32,532
我受够了这个澳洲考拉假黑鬼对我说...
I'm sick of this koala-hugging nigger telling me...

830
00:53:37,277 --> 00:53:38,835
四百年来
For 400 years,

831
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,781
那个字眼让我们抬不起头
That word has kept us down.

832
00:53:43,851 --> 00:53:45,478
你他妈说什么呢
What the fuck?

833
00:53:45,586 --> 00:53:49,352
历尽千辛万苦才翻越那座高山
It took a whole lot of trying just to get up that hill.

834
00:53:49,456 --> 00:53:52,357
现在我们迎来了盛大的同盟
Now we up in the big leagues,

835
00:53:52,459 --> 00:53:54,222
终于轮到我们反击了
Getting our turn at bat.

836
00:53:54,328 --> 00:53:56,990
伙计  我们都是一家人
Long as we live, it's you and me, baby.

837
00:53:57,665 --> 00:54:00,998
那是"杰弗逊一家"的主题曲  你真是有问题
That's the theme song for the Jeffersons. you really need help.

838
00:54:01,101 --> 00:54:04,229
是啊  但别看那是主题曲就忽视它的真实性
Yeah. just 'cause it's the theme song, don't make it not true.

839
00:54:04,338 --> 00:54:06,272
让我来告诉你什么才具有真实性
You know what? I'm gonna tell you what's true.

840
00:54:06,373 --> 00:54:09,809
我会指控你的  相信我
I'm gonna tag you back. you better believe that, baby.

841
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:12,504
伙计们
Guys! hey, guys!

842
00:54:13,113 --> 00:54:15,581
杰夫  离那动物远点
Jeff, stay away from that animal.

843
00:54:17,951 --> 00:54:20,784
我会咬下它的皮  我要...
I'm gonna bite his hide. I need...

844
00:54:21,822 --> 00:54:25,087
撕下它的胃膜当紧身衣
I need to wear his stomach skin like a unitard.

845
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:29,359
什么也别做!
Ain't nobody doing nothing to no one or body!

846
00:54:29,463 --> 00:54:34,332
如果珀特诺依先生感到有些虚弱  不愿行走
Now, if mr. Portnoy is feeling a little flu-ish, don't wanna walk,

847
00:54:34,435 --> 00:54:36,494
就把他抬到那头偶蹄类动物身上
Put him up on that cloven-hoof animal!

848
00:54:37,871 --> 00:54:39,168
我们还要赶路呢
We got ground to cover!

849
00:55:08,168 --> 00:55:11,433
好的  战俘营  场景67
All right, pow camp, scene 67.

850
00:55:12,339 --> 00:55:14,068
来啊  你们这些混蛋!
Bring it on, Cockburn!

851
00:55:21,181 --> 00:55:24,981
我的身体虽然被俘  精神却仍旧自由
My body may be shackled, but my mind wanders free.

852
00:55:29,757 --> 00:55:30,917
等等  让我再说一遍
Wait, wait, wait, let me do the line again.

853
00:55:31,024 --> 00:55:32,116
再说一遍台词
Let me do the line again.

854
00:55:32,226 --> 00:55:36,322
我的身体虽然被俘  精神却仍旧自由
My body may be shackled, but my mind wanders free.

855
00:55:43,537 --> 00:55:44,868
太好了  再来一遍
Good, again. again.

856
00:55:50,677 --> 00:55:53,237
太好了  现在开始受折磨的场景
Good, good. now let's do the torture scene.

857
00:55:53,347 --> 00:55:55,144
我看见那棵树的两侧都有苔藓
I see moss on both sides of that tree.

858
00:55:55,249 --> 00:55:58,377
也许我不是唯一一个进过训练营的人...
Well, you know, maybe if I wasn't the only one at boot camp...

859
00:55:58,485 --> 00:56:00,385
我肚子真的很疼  伙计们
My belly really hurts, you guys!

860
00:56:00,487 --> 00:56:02,682
不是开玩笑  我想吐
I'm not joking around, I'm nauseous.

861
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:05,020
让我下来  我要吐了!  我不想像亨德里斯一样死去
Let me off, I gotta puke! I don't wanna die like Hendrix

862
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:06,786
好的  好的
All right. all right.

863
00:56:11,365 --> 00:56:13,356
杰夫  你没事吧
Are you okay, Jeff?

864
00:56:13,467 --> 00:56:14,832
我好极了
I'm awesome.

865
00:56:17,237 --> 00:56:18,704
不是吧
Holy shit!

866
00:56:23,243 --> 00:56:25,404
大家趴下  趴下
Okay. everyone, down, down, down.

867
00:56:30,117 --> 00:56:31,607
现在我正在感觉自己错了
Man. now I'm tripping.

868
00:56:31,718 --> 00:56:34,346
那像是个战俘营  剧本里提到过
That looks like the pow camp from out the script, yo.

869
00:56:35,222 --> 00:56:36,917
斯比德曼是对的?
Speedman was right?

870
00:56:37,024 --> 00:56:38,389
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

871
00:56:38,492 --> 00:56:40,722
看看那些煮东西的桶  拿枪的守卫
Look at the cooking vats, the armed guards.

872
00:56:42,296 --> 00:56:44,389
像是个海洛因制作工厂
Looks like a heroin processing plant.

873
00:56:45,499 --> 00:56:46,625
当时我们在直升机上坐了几个小时
We were in that chopper for hours.

874
00:56:46,733 --> 00:56:48,997
我甚至感觉我们根本不在越南
I don't even think we're in vietnam anymore.

875
00:56:49,102 --> 00:56:51,536
-妈的  -该死  都不在越南?
- fuck. - shit. we ain't even in 'nam?

876
00:56:51,638 --> 00:56:54,402
是啊  更像是在缅甸或是老挝
No, most likely myanmar or laos.

877
00:56:54,508 --> 00:56:56,066
老挝他妈是什么
What the fuck is laos?

878
00:56:56,176 --> 00:56:57,973
金三角地区
It's the golden triangle.

879
00:56:58,078 --> 00:56:59,636
世界毒品往来聚集地
The world's hard drug superhighway.

880
00:56:59,746 --> 00:57:01,043
你怎么会知道这些
And how do you know about that?

881
00:57:01,148 --> 00:57:03,878
来的路上  我在飞机里的杂志上看见的
It was a really long trip. I read the in-flight magazine.

882
00:57:05,686 --> 00:57:06,983
停拍!
Cut!

883
00:57:08,655 --> 00:57:11,146
你看到什么了?  我这被挡到了
What do you see, man? I'm blocked.

884
00:57:11,258 --> 00:57:12,623
达米安  停拍!
Damien, cut!

885
00:57:14,394 --> 00:57:15,986
达米安  停拍!
Hey, Damien, cut!

886
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:18,491
他们抓住了斯比德曼
They got Speedman.

887
00:57:19,066 --> 00:57:20,499
看上去情况不妙
And it doesn't look good.

888
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:54,463
我是川
I am Tran.

889
00:57:55,435 --> 00:57:57,596
你是我工厂的入侵者
You are a trespasser in my poppy fields.

890
00:57:59,006 --> 00:58:01,634
你是毒品管制局的人渣
You are d.e.a. scum!

891
00:58:03,577 --> 00:58:07,013
剧本改写了我没看见吗
Were there some re-writes that I missed?

892
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,810
你想死吗
Do you want to die?

893
00:58:15,589 --> 00:58:17,056
-想吗  -不!
- do you? - no!

894
00:58:17,157 --> 00:58:21,287
拜...托  别...别伤害我!
Please, don't hurt me!

895
00:58:29,169 --> 00:58:30,363
再说一遍
Say that again.

896
00:58:31,371 --> 00:58:33,168
拜托  别伤害我
Please, don't hurt me.

897
00:58:33,273 --> 00:58:36,367
不是!  像之前那样说!
No! like you did before! say it!

898
00:58:37,344 --> 00:58:38,333
快说!
Say it!

899
00:58:38,445 --> 00:58:42,438
拜...托  别...别伤害我!
Please, don't hurt me!

900
00:58:58,065 --> 00:59:00,659
-什么?  -你是笨蛋杰克
- what? - you are simple Jack.

901
00:59:03,637 --> 00:59:05,502
你们看了笨蛋杰克?
You saw simple Jack?

902
00:59:05,605 --> 00:59:07,937
我们很喜欢这个人的故事  笨蛋杰克
We love the tale of this man, simple Jack.

903
00:59:09,643 --> 00:59:11,474
我们这里没什么好东西
We do not have many luxury here.

904
00:59:11,578 --> 00:59:14,012
"笨蛋杰克"是我们唯一拥有的电影
And simple Jack is the only movie we possess.

905
00:59:14,114 --> 00:59:17,948
你们还在看录像机
You got the vhs.

906
00:59:18,051 --> 00:59:20,110
我们看了很多遍
We've watched it many, many times.

907
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,688
你本该得奥斯卡奖的
You should've got oscar.

908
00:59:25,726 --> 00:59:27,489
知道吗  这...
Well, you know. it's...

909
00:59:28,762 --> 00:59:30,024
就算仅仅是被提名...
Just to be nominated...

910
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:31,358
你受到提名了?
You were nominated?

911
00:59:31,465 --> 00:59:32,989
不  我没有被提名
No, no, no. I wasn't nominated.

912
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:36,263
我是说就算仅仅是被提名了也好
I'm just saying that to have been nominated would have been nice.

913
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:38,736
你知道...很商业化...得打广告...
It's just... it's very political. you have to take out ads...

914
00:59:38,839 --> 00:59:41,330
-给我闭嘴  -好的  好的
- shut up now! - okay. okay.

915
00:59:42,175 --> 00:59:43,904
那么  你们打算
So, are you going to

916
00:59:45,545 --> 00:59:47,172
放我走还是...
Let me go, or...

917
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,407
不  我们要拿你换赎金
No. we'll hold you for ransom.

918
00:59:49,516 --> 00:59:51,313
我们会更加富有了
Much more money now!

919
01:00:02,896 --> 01:00:03,885
他正在开会
He's in a meeting.

920
01:00:03,997 --> 01:00:06,761
知道  我只进去和他谈一小会儿
Yeah, I know. in about two seconds with the Pecker.

921
01:00:07,801 --> 01:00:09,666
我会揪下你的乳头
I'm gonna rip your fucking tits off.

922
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:12,432
想谈谈麻烦事吗  现在有麻烦了
You wanna talk about trouble? that's trouble.

923
01:00:16,009 --> 01:00:17,909
你要干什么  派克 
What do you need, Peck?

924
01:00:18,011 --> 01:00:20,639
这句话应该是我问你吧  莱斯
No, more like what do you need, Les?

925
01:00:20,747 --> 01:00:21,941
眼镜?
Glasses?

926
01:00:23,016 --> 01:00:24,074
什么?
What?

927
01:00:24,184 --> 01:00:26,675
让你看清楚"热带惊雷"的合约
So you can read the tropic thunder contract

928
01:00:26,787 --> 01:00:29,187
上面清楚写着  塔格・斯比德曼是我的客户  
That guarantees my client, Tugg Speedman,

929
01:00:29,289 --> 01:00:33,020
需要在外景拍摄点安装数字录影机
Some form of digital video recorder on location.

930
01:00:33,794 --> 01:00:35,921
真不敢相信你让他进来了
- huh? - I can't believe you let him in.

931
01:00:37,564 --> 01:00:38,891
听着  混蛋  我现在嫉妒繁忙
Look, fuckstick, I'm incredibly busy,

932
01:00:38,892 --> 01:00:40,397
你马上给我出去
So why don't you get the hell out of her

933
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,560
否则我会把你那家伙揪下来插进你的屁眼
Before I snap your dick off and jam it into your ass?

934
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:45,695
不  不是说你  海伦
No, not you, helen.

935
01:00:45,806 --> 01:00:49,503
但若你没把效果做好我也会揪下你的乳头
But I will rip your tits off if you don't get me those theaters.

936
01:00:49,609 --> 01:00:51,133
好极了
Perfect.

937
01:00:51,244 --> 01:00:53,678
好啊  伙计  我把扬声器打开
Hey, Tuggernuts, I've got you on speakerphone.

938
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:55,645
现在我正和莱斯・葛罗斯曼在一起
I'm standing here with Les Grossman,

939
01:00:55,749 --> 01:00:58,912
他现在很想告诉你为什么他要
And he is dying to tell you why he's apparently wiped his ass

940
01:00:59,019 --> 01:01:01,317
拿你数码录影机合约的纸擦屁股了
With the tivo clause from your contract.

941
01:01:02,522 --> 01:01:04,513
我们是火龙帮
We are flaming dragon.

942
01:01:04,624 --> 01:01:06,990
斯比德曼现在在我们手上
Speedman is with us now.

943
01:01:07,094 --> 01:01:10,655
拿5千万来  我们就放他回去
For 50 million, you will get him back.

944
01:01:10,764 --> 01:01:12,925
-能不能把那些...  -你是谁?
- are you gonna get those... - who is this?

945
01:01:13,033 --> 01:01:15,729
-电话怎么会在你手上?  -我们是火龙帮!
- and how did you get this phone? - we are flaming dragon!

946
01:01:15,836 --> 01:01:17,736
笨蛋杰克现在在我们手上
Simple Jack belong to us now.

947
01:01:20,474 --> 01:01:22,499
你说的是真的?
He does, does he?

948
01:01:22,609 --> 01:01:25,077
我来告诉你  笨蛋
Let me tell you something, shitbird.

949
01:01:25,178 --> 01:01:27,612
我从未听过你们那破中介公司
I've never even heard of your little agency.

950
01:01:27,714 --> 01:01:29,682
但如果你认为你能挖的走我的客户...
But if you think you can poach my client...

951
01:01:29,783 --> 01:01:34,311
拿5千万来  否则别想再见笨蛋杰克  我们会杀了他
Send $50 million, or you no see simple Jack again because we kill him.

952
01:01:34,421 --> 01:01:35,911
我是莱斯・葛罗斯曼  你是哪位?
This is Les Grossman. who is this?

953
01:01:36,022 --> 01:01:38,320
我们是火龙帮!
This is flaming dragon!

954
01:01:38,425 --> 01:01:41,189
好吧  火龙帮  去你妈的
Okay. flaming dragon. fuckface.

955
01:01:41,294 --> 01:01:46,129
首先  向后退一大步  操你自己的脸!
First, take a big step back and literally fuck your own face!

956
01:01:47,501 --> 01:01:50,231
我不知道你们要玩什么泛太平洋
Now, I don't know what kind of pan-pacific bullshit power play

957
01:01:50,337 --> 01:01:52,805
集中攻势的鬼把戏  但是亚洲人  杰克是我的人
You're trying to pull here, but asia, Jack, is my territory.

958
01:01:52,906 --> 01:01:54,203
因此无论你怎么想  请再思考一遍
So whatever you're thinking, you better think again.

959
01:01:54,307 --> 01:01:55,672
否则我会去那里
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to head down there,

960
01:01:55,775 --> 01:01:59,142
在那里进行一次残忍的大面积的轰炸
And I will rain down an ungodly fucking firestorm upon you.

961
01:01:59,246 --> 01:02:00,873
那时你他妈就得打电话到联合国
You're gonna have to call the fucking united nations

962
01:02:00,981 --> 01:02:02,889
寻求具有约束力的解决办法
And get a fucking binding resolution

963
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:05,008
以免被我完全毁了
To keep me from fucking destroying you

964
01:02:05,118 --> 01:02:07,712
我很认真  你们这些王八蛋!
I am talking scorched earth, motherfucker!

965
01:02:07,821 --> 01:02:09,584
我会将你们统统杀光
I will massacre you!

966
01:02:09,689 --> 01:02:11,623
我会干掉你们
I will fuck you up!

967
01:02:19,432 --> 01:02:21,161
-能帮我查出那是谁吗  -好的
- could you find out who that was? go. - yeah. yeah.

968
01:02:56,603 --> 01:02:59,595
戴上这个  更像笨蛋杰克的牙
You wear these. more like simple Jack teeth.

969
01:03:01,541 --> 01:03:04,203
我知道你是我的超级粉丝  那很好...
Hey. look, I know you're a big fan, and that's great...

970
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,907
戴上假牙!
Put teeth in!

971
01:03:16,022 --> 01:03:17,887
快演
Now do movie.

972
01:03:17,991 --> 01:03:19,652
整部电影?
The whole movie?

973
01:03:19,759 --> 01:03:21,420
我不能  我不知道整部电影...
I can't. I don't know the whole...

974
01:03:21,528 --> 01:03:24,019
快演!  不演就杀了你!
You perform! you perform or die!

975
01:03:29,169 --> 01:03:30,568
爸爸
Pa.

976
01:03:32,539 --> 01:03:33,904
更蠢一点!
More stupid!

977
01:03:35,675 --> 01:03:40,738
爸爸  为什么你要让我那么难受呢
Pa, why you gotta make me feel bad?

978
01:03:43,183 --> 01:03:44,514
你们都看见了
You saw what I saw.

979
01:03:44,618 --> 01:03:47,212
若我们袖手旁观  塔格・斯比德曼必死无疑
Tugg Speedman is dead meat if we don't do something soon.

980
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,686
我们得想办法赶紧回到旅馆
Yeah. we could do something by getting our asses back to the hotel,

981
01:03:49,789 --> 01:03:51,120
而那是另一个方向
Which is in the other direction!

982
01:03:51,224 --> 01:03:52,816
那是不对的
Ain't right.

983
01:03:52,926 --> 01:03:54,951
大逃亡中如果史蒂夫・麦奎因和他的伙计们
What would've happened in the great escape

984
01:03:55,061 --> 01:03:58,895
逃跑了  那激烈的场景还怎么上演
If steve mcqueen and them dudes had turned tail and ran?

985
01:03:58,999 --> 01:04:02,992
电影都那么演  他们最后顺利逃走
Well, that's what that movie was about. they were escaping. they ran away.

986
01:04:03,103 --> 01:04:05,731
我同意  但关键是他们都没有袖手旁观
I'm trying to agree with you. the point is they did something.

987
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:07,033
那我们该怎么做呢
Then what are we supposed to do, huh?

988
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:11,042
他擦那一支没有子弹的枪  那就是计划吗
'cause he's cleaning a gun with no bullets. yeah, that's a plan.

989
01:04:11,144 --> 01:04:14,944
我就像一个小男孩在紧张的时候玩弄他的小DD
I'm just like a little boy, playing with his dick when he's nervous.

990
01:04:18,485 --> 01:04:20,976
等一下  等一下  等一下
Wait a minute. wait a minute. wait a minute.

991
01:04:21,087 --> 01:04:24,147
我有个主意  这或许有些疯狂
I got an idea. this might be a little crazy.

992
01:04:24,257 --> 01:04:26,225
疯狂也比没有主意强
Crazy's better than nothing.

993
01:04:26,326 --> 01:04:30,285
1998年我为凯迪做过一个低成本的喜剧片
Back in '98, I did a low-budget titty comedy for skinemax.

994
01:04:30,397 --> 01:04:33,730
-性露营  记得吗?  -记得
- sex camp. remember it? - yeah.

995
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:37,792
总之  我和其他露营者当时必须
Anyway, me and the campers from the uncool camp

996
01:04:37,904 --> 01:04:40,429
冲进有钱女孩的露营地
Had to break into the rich girl camp.

997
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:42,235
我们做了什么呢
So, what we did,

998
01:04:42,342 --> 01:04:45,334
我们用木桩和内衣做了一个发射机
We built a catapult out of logs and underwear,

999
01:04:45,445 --> 01:04:49,006
我们用这个发射到墙那边然后跳伞着陆
And they shot us over the wall, and we parachuted down.

1000
01:04:54,621 --> 01:04:55,986
听着
Look,

1001
01:04:56,089 --> 01:04:59,388
-兄弟们  我们已经知道计划了  -好吧 
- you guys, we already know the plan. - fine.

1002
01:04:59,492 --> 01:05:03,861
我们就按照《热带惊雷》那本书
We do it just like in the book, chapter 26, the wet offensive.

1003
01:05:03,963 --> 01:05:06,363
第26章湿漉攻击所写的那样去做
The book of tropic thunder.

1004
01:05:06,466 --> 01:05:08,696
是啊  你们读过那本书吗?
Yeah, did you guys read the book?

1005
01:05:10,003 --> 01:05:12,631
我看了图片
The flap, I read the back flap and saw the pictures.

1006
01:05:13,406 --> 01:05:16,534
没关系  那和剧本是一模一样的
Well, it's okay. it's exactly the same as in the script.

1007
01:05:16,643 --> 01:05:17,701
太好了
Cool.

1008
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:22,239
你们都读过剧本的  是吧?
You guys all read the script, right?

1009
01:05:22,349 --> 01:05:24,442
我不读剧本  是剧本读我
I don't read the script, script reads me.

1010
01:05:25,618 --> 01:05:27,085
那TMD又是什么意思?
What the hell does that even mean?

1011
01:05:27,187 --> 01:05:30,554
你到底想到了什么  直接TMD说出来!
What you getting at with the books, scripts? spit that shit out, man!

1012
01:05:33,893 --> 01:05:35,724
好吧  湿漉攻击那章
All right. the wet offensive.

1013
01:05:36,763 --> 01:05:39,664
奥西里斯和胖子去分散敌人注意来做掩护
Osiris and fats go undercover as a diversion.

1014
01:05:39,766 --> 01:05:42,098
莫唐和布鲁克林就渡过河溜进去
Motown and brooklyn sneak in via the river.

1015
01:05:42,202 --> 01:05:44,602
是的  但是那些人可是经过训练的士兵
Yeah. but those dudes was trained soldiers.

1016
01:05:48,608 --> 01:05:51,600
我们TMD是经过训练的演员
And we trained actors, motherfucker.

1017
01:05:51,711 --> 01:05:56,045
是时候像个男人一样行动起来了  我不是说笑的
Time to man up. and I ain't gonna sugarcoat.

1018
01:05:56,149 --> 01:05:58,913
我们有人可能甚至会一去不返
Some of us might not even make it back.

1019
01:05:59,018 --> 01:06:02,112
你什么意思?  不在同一架飞机上?
What do you mean? like not on the same flight?

1020
01:06:04,824 --> 01:06:07,588
阿帕和我已经穿上了土地母亲的自然迷彩服
Alpa and I's already wearing earth mama's natural night camo.

1021
01:06:07,694 --> 01:06:09,525
-别激动  本森  -对不起
- cool it, benson. - sorry.

1022
01:06:10,597 --> 01:06:15,125
我们要去侦查  大家想个计划  20分钟后回来
We gonna scout, get a plan together. we ain't back in 20, come looking.

1023
01:06:16,636 --> 01:06:18,501
我们是火龙帮
We are flaming dragon.

1024
01:06:24,744 --> 01:06:27,838
火龙帮是一个海洛因制造商
Flaming dragon's a heroin manufacturer.

1025
01:06:27,947 --> 01:06:31,041
亚洲80%的毒品交易都是他们做的
They're responsible for an eighth of the drug trade in asia.

1026
01:06:31,151 --> 01:06:34,382
-利润率非常大  -各位!
- huge profit margin. - guys!

1027
01:06:34,487 --> 01:06:37,422
可不可以有人告诉我计划是什么?
Would somebody please let me know what the game plan is?

1028
01:06:37,524 --> 01:06:39,253
派克!  我们已经控制住情况了
Peck! we have it handled.

1029
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:41,850
请不要打岔  一切都在掌握中
Please, don't interrupt. everything's under control.

1030
01:06:41,961 --> 01:06:43,952
知道了  知道了
I got it. got it.

1031
01:06:56,075 --> 01:06:58,305
-莱斯・葛罗斯曼  -我们还没拿到钱
- Les Grossman. - we not get money yet.

1032
01:06:58,845 --> 01:07:00,972
现在的价钱是10亿!
Price now 100 million!

1033
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,913
你们要么现在付钱  否则明天就撕票
You pay now, or tomorrow simple Jack die.

1034
01:07:04,017 --> 01:07:07,077
好的  让我记一下
Great. let me get this down.

1035
01:07:07,187 --> 01:07:08,620
1亿
100 million.

1036
01:07:08,721 --> 01:07:11,189
等等!  我有一个更好的主意
Wait! I got a better idea.

1037
01:07:11,991 --> 01:07:13,822
不如不给你1亿
Instead of 100 million,

1038
01:07:13,927 --> 01:07:16,663
我们送给你一个芝士JB怎么样
How about I send you a hobo's dick cheese?

1039
01:07:16,896 --> 01:07:19,194
然后你杀掉他  该怎么做就怎么做  傻逼
Then you kill him! do your thing! skin the fucking bastard!

1040
01:07:19,299 --> 01:07:21,494
放手去做  随你的便
Go to town, man! go to town!

1041
01:07:21,601 --> 01:07:23,762
-不...  -在此期间  如往常一样
- no... - in the meantime, and as usual,

1042
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:25,531
去跟你自己搞去吧!
Go fuck yourself!

1043
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:29,199
-不  -我们不和恐怖分子谈判
- no. - we don't negotiate with terrorists.

1044
01:07:31,311 --> 01:07:34,041
你疯了吗?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! hey, hey, are you insane?

1045
01:07:34,147 --> 01:07:35,978
-我觉得我可以做得更好  -我认为那已经很好了
- I think I could've done that better. - I thought it was good.

1046
01:07:36,082 --> 01:07:37,379
他们会杀了他!
They're gonna kill him!

1047
01:07:43,256 --> 01:07:46,453
然后我们在媒体上为他悼念
And we'll weep for him, in the press.

1048
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:50,022
以他的名字建一个奖学金
Set up a scholarship in his name.

1049
01:07:50,129 --> 01:07:54,065
最后呢  我说的是最终的结果
Eventually, and I'm talking way, way down the road,

1050
01:07:54,167 --> 01:07:55,657
我们发一个保险赔偿申请
We file an insurance claim.

1051
01:07:55,768 --> 01:07:58,566
最好是在财政年度结束之前
Preferably before the end of the fiscal year.

1052
01:07:58,671 --> 01:08:02,402
实际上  保险赔偿的金额比电影损失的还多
Actually, the claim alone would net us more than the movie would lose.

1053
01:08:04,511 --> 01:08:06,274
你不是说真的吧
You can't be serious.

1054
01:08:08,214 --> 01:08:09,909
我们面对现实吧
Let's face it.

1055
01:08:10,016 --> 01:08:14,043
他再也不是什么炙手可热的演员了
The kids aren't dressing up as scorcher for purim anymore.

1056
01:08:15,455 --> 01:08:18,447
斯比德曼是个要消失的明星了
Speedman is a dying star,

1057
01:08:18,558 --> 01:08:21,789
一个走向黑洞的白人侏儒
A white dwarf heading for a black hole.

1058
01:08:21,895 --> 01:08:24,625
那是物理规律  不可避免的
That's physics. it's inevitable.

1059
01:08:24,731 --> 01:08:28,064
派克  我们在这里获得了一个绝好的机会
We've been handed an incredible opportunity here, Peck.

1060
01:08:28,167 --> 01:08:32,001
宇宙正在和我们交流
The universe is talking to us right now.

1061
01:08:32,105 --> 01:08:33,663
你只需要倾听
You just gotta listen.

1062
01:08:46,786 --> 01:08:50,381
派克  这就是工作中有趣的地方
See, this is the good part, Pecker. this is when the job gets fun.

1063
01:08:51,691 --> 01:08:54,854
要求就会有结果
Ask and you shall receive.

1064
01:08:55,895 --> 01:09:00,025
-好啊  -你合作  我们就合作
- all right. - you play ball, we play ball.

1065
01:09:00,133 --> 01:09:03,500
我知道你想要糖果
I know you want the goodies.

1066
01:09:03,603 --> 01:09:05,594
欢迎来到好糖果屋
Welcome to the goody room.

1067
01:09:05,705 --> 01:09:10,335
你有注意听吗?  因为我说的是G5飞机
You paying attention? 'cause I'm talking g5 for the Pecker.

1068
01:09:10,443 --> 01:09:11,705
那将是你能享受的
That's how you're gonna roll.

1069
01:09:11,811 --> 01:09:15,770
再也不用发传单做宣传
No more frequent flier bitch miles for my boy.

1070
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:25,581
摇摆着穿过你的膝盖!
Swinging past your knees!

1071
01:09:31,364 --> 01:09:33,958
或者你也可以良心发现
Or you can grow a conscience

1072
01:09:34,067 --> 01:09:36,433
然后看看在下面5分钟里会发生什么
In the next five minutes and see where that takes you.

1073
01:09:41,407 --> 01:09:43,500
我明说了吧
Let me get this straight.

1074
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:47,239
你想让我15年的客户
You want me to let my client of 15 years,

1075
01:09:47,347 --> 01:09:48,712
我最好的朋友
One of my best friends,

1076
01:09:48,815 --> 01:09:53,445
孤独的死在丛林里  为了一点钱和G5飞机?
Die in the jungle, alone, for some money and a g5?

1077
01:09:54,587 --> 01:09:55,713
是的
Yes.

1078
01:10:00,793 --> 01:10:03,057
一个G5飞机?
A g5 airplane?

1079
01:10:05,164 --> 01:10:06,222
是的
Yes.

1080
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:09,996
以及很多钱
And lots of money.

1081
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:26,712
但是妈妈很照顾杰克
But mama take care of Jack a lot.

1082
01:10:27,553 --> 01:10:31,284
她什么时候才能醒过来呢?
How many more sleeps before she wakes up again?

1083
01:10:31,391 --> 01:10:32,915
对不起  杰克
Sorry, Jack.

1084
01:10:33,026 --> 01:10:35,290
她现在在天堂了
She in heaven now.

1085
01:10:36,062 --> 01:10:39,327
妈的!  我以为电影就更差劲了
Damn! I thought the movie was bad.

1086
01:10:39,432 --> 01:10:42,560
她永远的沉睡了
She sleep forever.

1087
01:10:42,669 --> 01:10:45,797
值得赞赏啊  他缓和了弱智的程度
To the man's credit, he's actually eased up on the retard throttle.

1088
01:10:45,905 --> 01:10:49,500
现在演出就更平衡  观众能更有共鸣
And now that's added a balance, and the audience can connect.

1089
01:10:49,609 --> 01:10:53,409
这是101剧场  但是他还有很长的路要走
I mean, this is theater 101, but, you know, he's had a tough road.

1090
01:10:53,513 --> 01:10:54,639
他会成为一个自然主义者
He'll become a naturalist.

1091
01:10:54,747 --> 01:10:56,442
-是的  -打破那距离美感
- yeah. - break down the aesthetic distance,

1092
01:10:56,549 --> 01:10:58,278
然后...
Then the...

1093
01:11:00,953 --> 01:11:02,580
我告诉过你我会打回来的
Told you I'd tag you back.

1094
01:11:05,258 --> 01:11:07,522
我可以为我曾经所做的
Can I tell you that I'm sorry

1095
01:11:07,627 --> 01:11:09,925
任何攻击行为向你道歉吗
For any offense I might've caused, man?

1096
01:11:10,029 --> 01:11:12,395
-我只...  -是一个混蛋?
- I just got caught up in... - in being a dumbass?

1097
01:11:12,498 --> 01:11:13,897
我想是的
I guess so.

1098
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,696
我不知道为什么你还在做这种婆婆妈妈的事
Why you still doing this chicken george shit, I have no idea.

1099
01:11:16,803 --> 01:11:18,100
-我也不知道  -超出我的理解
- neither do i. - it's beyond me.

1100
01:11:18,204 --> 01:11:20,399
-超出我的理解  -你困惑了
- it's beyond me. - you confused.

1101
01:11:20,506 --> 01:11:22,440
-我确实有点困惑  -我知道
- I am a little confused. - I know.

1102
01:11:24,043 --> 01:11:25,840
但是我们和好了吗?
But are we cool?

1103
01:11:25,945 --> 01:11:27,276
还没
Not really.

1104
01:11:31,084 --> 01:11:32,676
老兄
Hey, man.

1105
01:11:32,785 --> 01:11:34,480
-情况怎么样?  -很好  你呢?
- how's it going? - good. yourself?

1106
01:11:34,587 --> 01:11:36,612
如果没有关系的话
Hey, so, if it's no big deal,

1107
01:11:36,723 --> 01:11:39,590
我想我就在这做后援了吧
I think I'm just gonna hang back here for the mission.

1108
01:11:39,692 --> 01:11:41,319
看着东西
Watch the stuff.

1109
01:11:41,427 --> 01:11:43,452
-可以吗?  -什么?  不!
- is that cool? - what? no!

1110
01:11:43,563 --> 01:11:45,463
我们需要你  杰夫
We need you, Jeff.

1111
01:11:45,565 --> 01:11:47,157
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

1112
01:11:47,266 --> 01:11:48,824
好吧  听着
Okay, look, man.

1113
01:11:50,069 --> 01:11:52,367
-我有事要告诉你  -好的
- I got something to tell you. - okay.

1114
01:11:54,607 --> 01:11:57,337
你知道我之前吃的那些软糖吗?
You know those jellybeans I was eating?

1115
01:11:57,443 --> 01:12:00,537
那些其实不是软糖
Well, they weren't jellybeans, okay?

1116
01:12:01,447 --> 01:12:04,245
-那些是毒品  -真的?
- they were drugs. - really?

1117
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:08,719
如果我下去了  靠近那些毒品  我就完了
I get down there near the mother lode, I am done. I'm jonesing bad, man.

1118
01:12:08,821 --> 01:12:11,756
我肯定会吸掉那里所有的海洛因
I'm gonna fucking do all the heroin in the fucking world.

1119
01:12:15,061 --> 01:12:16,893
如果你们想要我挺过去
If you guys wanna make it through

1120
01:12:16,894 --> 01:12:19,225
你们要把我捆在树上
This thing, you gotta strap me to a tree

1121
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:24,366
-你说真的?  -是的  我说真的  一棵树上
- are you serious? - yeah, I'm serious. literally, a tree.

1122
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:27,337
不管怎么样  你们都不要放我走
And you can, no matter what, you can't fucking untie me until it is done,

1123
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,998
直到那东西从我身上完全消失
Until it is out of my system.

1124
01:12:29,108 --> 01:12:30,735
我会说"老兄  我很好  没问题"
I'm gonna say, "hey, man, I'm cool. it's cool.

1125
01:12:30,843 --> 01:12:32,401
"我终于好了  我终于好了  放开我吧"
"i'm finally better. I'm finally better. untie me."

1126
01:12:32,512 --> 01:12:35,709
别听我的!  我所说的任何话都是谎言!
Don't listen to me! anything I fucking say is a lie!

1127
01:12:35,815 --> 01:12:37,146
明白了
You got it!

1128
01:12:37,817 --> 01:12:39,876
再见  妈妈!
Goodbye, mama!

1129
01:12:39,986 --> 01:12:43,114
现在你可以在天堂吃冰激淋
Now you can have ice cream in heaven.

1130
01:12:43,222 --> 01:12:48,182
我会在睡梦中看到你
I'll see you tonight, when I go to bed, in my head movies.

1131
01:12:49,128 --> 01:12:53,724
但是这个梦让我哭泣
But this head movie makes my eyes rain.

1132
01:13:02,775 --> 01:13:06,006
被打了一记
Dang. gilligan catching a kidney shot.

1133
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:10,678
-他们把他带走了!  -那真是折磨
- they got him on the move! - that's torture, man.

1134
01:13:10,817 --> 01:13:13,684
他们把他关在那里
Okay. that's where they keeping him.

1135
01:13:13,786 --> 01:13:15,981
我衣服要裂了
I gotta get cracking on my costume.

1136
01:13:16,088 --> 01:13:17,487
你能干针线活吗?
Say, are you good with a needle and thread?

1137
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:18,614
当然
Hell, yeah.

1138
01:13:18,724 --> 01:13:20,368
阿帕・奇诺上个春季卖了
Alpa Chino Chinos sold more than five

1139
01:13:20,369 --> 01:13:22,057
500万件裤子
Million pairs last spring at the gap

1140
01:13:22,161 --> 01:13:24,857
-我自己缝的样式  -我们走
- I sewed them patterns myself, baby. - let's roll out.

1141
01:13:56,863 --> 01:13:59,093
这是个树枝小奥斯卡人
It's a little twig man oscar.

1142
01:14:05,705 --> 01:14:08,105
我会叫你小胖墩
I'm going to call you half squat.

1143
01:14:09,809 --> 01:14:11,777
你可以叫我
And you can call me

1144
01:14:12,845 --> 01:14:14,142
爸爸
Papa.

1145
01:14:37,637 --> 01:14:39,366
看看这些星星
Wow, look at all those stars.

1146
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:43,308
真的让人感到很渺小
Really makes a guy feel pretty small.

1147
01:14:44,844 --> 01:14:47,246
这可能是我们最后一次看星星了
This could be the last time we look at these stars.

1148
01:14:48,381 --> 01:14:49,848
那真美
Man, that's beauty.

1149
01:14:51,784 --> 01:14:54,844
如今晚的夜色让我思考一切到底是为什么

01:23:24,997 --> 01:23:26,726
我仍然能看到你
I can still see you.

1279
01:23:32,871 --> 01:23:33,963
塔格!
Tugg!

1280
01:23:36,508 --> 01:23:37,668
塔格?
Tugg?

1281
01:23:39,745 --> 01:23:40,939
终于找到你了
Gotcha.

1282
01:23:42,114 --> 01:23:45,015
赶快收拾一下你的东西  我们回家去
Roll your shit up, man. we going home.

1283
01:23:45,117 --> 01:23:46,243
回家?
Home?

1284
01:23:48,387 --> 01:23:52,221
但是我每天都有5场演出  而且座无虚席
But I'm doing five shows a day for a standing-room-only crowd.

1285
01:23:52,324 --> 01:23:54,884
你还不明白么  这里就是我的家
Don't you get it? I already am home.

1286
01:23:57,196 --> 01:24:00,324
好吧  朋友  你得明白...
All right, now, dude, you gotta get it...

1287
01:24:00,432 --> 01:24:02,627
这个是我儿子给我的
My son gave this to me.

1288
01:24:02,734 --> 01:24:06,226
-这是你的树枝朋友?  -他叫树枝娃娃
- that's your stick buddy? - his name is twigman.

1289
01:24:06,338 --> 01:24:08,169
他是不是要跟我们走呢
Does he wanna come with us?

1290
01:24:28,427 --> 01:24:30,190
你  趴下!
Get the hell down!

1291
01:24:30,295 --> 01:24:33,355
你在干什么呢  别动那支枪
What you doing? what you doing? don't touch that gun.

1292
01:24:33,465 --> 01:24:34,864
不要  别动那枪 
Don't do it! don't touch that gun!

1293
01:24:34,967 --> 01:24:37,265
妈的  要是你敢动那抢...
On my momma, if you touch that gun...

1294
01:24:41,907 --> 01:24:44,307
-狗屁  开始了  -过来
- oh, shit, it's on! - over here!

1295
01:25:15,641 --> 01:25:17,700
掩护我  主角 
Shadow me, pinocchio!

1296
01:25:17,809 --> 01:25:19,037
烟雾
Smoke!

1297
01:25:31,423 --> 01:25:32,947
杰夫  不要
Jeff, don't!

1298
01:25:33,792 --> 01:25:35,783
我做什么都无所谓了
It doesn't matter what I do.

1299
01:25:35,894 --> 01:25:38,863
我就是个扫把星总把事情搞砸  没人会尊敬我
I'll always be a screw-up. no one'll ever respect me.

1300
01:25:38,964 --> 01:25:42,957
不是的  你可不是扫把星  你能带给我们欢笑   
That is not true, you are not a screw-up! you make so many people laugh.

1301
01:25:43,068 --> 01:25:45,298
他们只是笑我放屁
They only laugh at my farts.

1302
01:25:45,404 --> 01:25:47,395
杰夫  我们现在真的该走了  
Jeff, we really need to go now!

1303
01:25:47,506 --> 01:25:49,098
我是罪有应得!
This is all I deserve!

1304
01:26:09,261 --> 01:26:11,491
敢笑话我  你们这群杂种!
Laugh at that, you bastards!

1305
01:26:11,597 --> 01:26:14,998
很可笑  很滑稽啊
Hilarious! hilarious!

1306
01:26:16,535 --> 01:26:19,368
我们走吧  再过16小时他们就醒来了
Let's move. we only have 16 hours before they wake up.

1307
01:26:26,979 --> 01:26:28,571
听起来像是要吃晚饭的铃声
Sounds like the dinner bell's ringing.

1308
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:31,615
这群混账看来是要爬进来生吞了我们
These assholes are gonna be crawling in here ready to fucking eat us.

1309
01:26:34,553 --> 01:26:37,420
这  好了  你就在这呆着  
There. all right, you keep six right here.

1310
01:26:39,358 --> 01:26:41,519
快点  我们走
Come on, let's go.

1311
01:26:41,627 --> 01:26:43,561
快呀  你们磨蹭什么啊  我们得快点了
Come on, what are you guys doing? let's get out of here!

1312
01:26:43,662 --> 01:26:45,323
他现在失去自我了
He's on tilt status.

1313
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:49,389
我扮演内尔・阿姆斯特朗在月球探测器时也这样过
Same thing happened to me when I played Neil Armstrong in moonshot.

1314
01:26:49,501 --> 01:26:51,594
后来他们在伯班克的一条小道上发现的我
They found me in an alley in Burbank

1315
01:26:51,703 --> 01:26:54,934
还在一个旧冰箱盒里想要重新融入地球
Trying to re-enter the earth's atmosphere in an old refrigerator box.

1316
01:27:00,445 --> 01:27:02,675
给我喷火器  你得去开直升机  
Give me the flame thrower. you gotta start the chopper.

1317
01:27:02,781 --> 01:27:06,217
-不  不给  给我  -没时间了  我会处理好的
- no, fuck that! just give me this. - no time! I'll take care of this!

1318
01:27:07,452 --> 01:27:09,352
好吧  把你的钩子给我
All right. give me your hooks.

1319
01:27:09,454 --> 01:27:11,081
别担心  我反正也不会再用了
Don't worry, I'm not gonna put them on again.

1320
01:27:11,189 --> 01:27:14,022
-快点给我  -好  给
- just give me your goddamn hooks. - all right. here.

1321
01:27:14,126 --> 01:27:16,287
把那帮兄弟带上直升机  要快啊
Get those boys back to the bird, pronto!

1322
01:27:21,233 --> 01:27:23,394
妈的  还没玩够啊
Shit! enough!

1323
01:27:23,502 --> 01:27:25,402
破烂假货
Fake shit!

1324
01:27:28,507 --> 01:27:29,633
他妈的
Fuck!

1325
01:27:37,349 --> 01:27:40,512
快去找你的同伴们  把他们带到直升机那
Go get your guys! get them to the chopper!

1326
01:27:40,619 --> 01:27:42,712
我来对付这群混蛋
I'll take care of these yahoos!

1327
01:27:44,756 --> 01:27:47,020
你给我好好听着  然后跟我说  
You're gonna focus up now, motherfucker, and say it.

1328
01:27:47,125 --> 01:27:49,252
-是我  塔格  -是我  塔格
- "it's me, Tugg!" - it's me, Tugg.

1329
01:27:49,361 --> 01:27:50,828
很好  现在告诉我  塔格是谁  
That's right! now, Tugg who?

1330
01:27:50,929 --> 01:27:53,727
-塔格什么  我?  -我不知道  你是谁
- Tugg who? I don't know. who are you? - me?

1331
01:27:53,832 --> 01:27:55,527
我知道我是谁
I know who I am!

1332
01:27:55,634 --> 01:27:59,365
我是在电影里演那个假扮另一个家伙的家伙
I'm a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude.

1333
01:27:59,471 --> 01:28:00,529
什么
What?

1334
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:02,732
你却是一个都不知道自己谁的家伙
You a dude that don't know what dude he is!

1335
01:28:02,841 --> 01:28:05,537
还是你是一个不知道自己是谁的家伙
Or are you a dude who has no idea what dude he is

1336
01:28:05,644 --> 01:28:06,906
却假装知道自己是谁...
And claims to know what dude he is...

1337
01:28:07,012 --> 01:28:08,747
你们到底在说些什么呀
What the fuck are you guys talking about?

1338
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:09,972
...假扮另一个家伙?
...by playing other dudes?

1339
01:28:10,082 --> 01:28:11,276
我知道我是谁
I know what dude I am!

1340
01:28:11,383 --> 01:28:14,181
-你害怕了  -我才没害怕  我怕什么
- you're scared. - I ain't scared. scared of what?

1341
01:28:14,286 --> 01:28:15,548
或者是怕谁
Or scared of who?

1342
01:28:15,654 --> 01:28:18,248
-怕谁  -快点吧  我们真得快点离开了
- scared of who? - come on, guys. we really need to go!

1343
01:28:18,356 --> 01:28:19,618
怕你自己
Scared of you.

1344
01:28:24,529 --> 01:28:26,861
-俄滴娘啊  -这到底是怎么了
- jesus. - what's going on?

1345
01:28:26,965 --> 01:28:28,489
家伙要浮现出来了
The dudes are emerging.

1346
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:29,931
他是对的  
He's right, you know.

1347
01:28:31,703 --> 01:28:33,102
我不是
I am not

1348
01:28:34,673 --> 01:28:36,368
林肯・奥西里斯上士
Sergeant Lincoln Osiris.

1349
01:28:40,779 --> 01:28:42,246
我们得快点走了
We gotta roll out.

1350
01:28:42,347 --> 01:28:45,578
我也不是奥玛来爸爸
Nor am I father O'malley.

1351
01:28:47,819 --> 01:28:50,754
或者是内尔・阿姆斯特朗
Or Neil Armstrong.

1352
01:28:58,330 --> 01:29:00,491
我想...我只是一个无名小卒
I think I might be nobody.

1353
01:29:03,168 --> 01:29:05,830
你们俩内心的不安全感也太荒谬了吧
The insecurity level with you guys is ridiculous!

1354
01:29:07,105 --> 01:29:10,074
-"家家"有本难念的经  -是的  都有过
- everybody's got issues! - yeah, man, everybody got issues.

1355
01:29:10,175 --> 01:29:12,735
你是柯克・拉扎勒斯  
Come on! you're Kirk Lazarus.

1356
01:29:12,844 --> 01:29:15,005
就是因为你  我才喜欢上演戏的
You're the whole reason I got into acting.

1357
01:29:15,113 --> 01:29:16,944
我在戏剧学院的时候能背出
I memorized every single monologue

1358
01:29:17,048 --> 01:29:19,642
你所演的每一部剧的每一句台词
You ever did when I was in theater school.

1359
01:29:19,751 --> 01:29:21,776
-不会吧  -是的  听着  塔格
- really? - yeah. and look, Tugg!

1360
01:29:21,887 --> 01:29:24,321
我在8年级的时候  看了24遍炙热人物Ⅰ
I saw scorcher I 24 times when I was in eighth grade.

1361
01:29:24,422 --> 01:29:27,391
那影片让我神魂颠倒  我喜欢死了  你是纯爷们  
That shit blew me away! I got high to that shit! you the man!

1362
01:29:27,492 --> 01:29:30,620

Yeah, man, scorcher I was great. let's get the fuck out of here!

1363
01:29:30,729 --> 01:29:34,859
塔格  现在只剩下你了  朋友
Tugg, Tugger, you're the last piece of the puzzle, buddy.

1364
01:29:34,966 --> 01:29:37,958
我们需要你  你的朋友需要你  跟我们走吗
We need you! your men need you! are you with us?

1365
01:29:42,307 --> 01:29:44,298
我是幻想雄鸡
I'm a rooster illusion.

1366
01:29:44,409 --> 01:29:45,603
妈的  我们以后再跟他讲道理  
Fuck it. we'll deal with him later.

1367
01:29:45,710 --> 01:29:48,873
我们快走吧  快  加速  走
Let's move. come on. come on. double time. gotta go!

1369
01:30:04,196 --> 01:30:07,063
尝尝这个  你个嗑药的侏儒
Just say no to this, you drug-making midget.

1370
01:30:11,636 --> 01:30:13,103
坚持住
Gotta hold on!

1371
01:30:19,277 --> 01:30:20,642
福尔・立夫
Four Leaf!

1372
01:30:25,383 --> 01:30:26,714
你长出手来了?
You grew hands?

1373
01:30:35,961 --> 01:30:37,485
火箭筒  同志们
Rpg, gentlemen!

1374
01:30:40,265 --> 01:30:41,789
你们干吗
Where are you going?

1375
01:30:47,305 --> 01:30:49,830
做完这个我要转行到饮食业
Oh, my god. I am moving to catering after this.

1376
01:31:11,863 --> 01:31:13,194

不  说真的  我现在不疯了
No, I'm telling you, I'm not being crazy. they'll listen to me.

1399
01:32:25,971 --> 01:32:28,804

I know it sounds weird, but I have a connection with them.
