1
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:03,962
Alpa Chino!

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:05,672
We're loaded

3
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,592
I love the pussy, hell, yeah

4
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,470
I love that pussy
dripping down to the floor, oh, no

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,972
The wettest pussy, hell, yeah
I love the pussy, hell, yeah

6
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:17,184
I'm drinking up
your Booty Sweat and busting a nut

7
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,061
Alpa Chino got that pussy control

8
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,063
Alpa Chino's Booty Sweat.

9
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,564
Pop an ass open!

10
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,193
Booty Sweat and Bust-A-Nut bars
available at concessions now.

11
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:34,493
In 2013, when the Earth's rotation
came to a halt...

12
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:38,163
The President has declared
all of North America a disaster area.

13
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,999
I call on my fellow Americans
to come together...

14
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:45,087
... the world called on the one man
who could make a difference.

15
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:53,178
When it happened again,
the world called on him once more.

16
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,890
And no one saw it coming
three more times!

17
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,690
Now,

18
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:08,694
the one man who made a difference
five times before,

19
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:15,492
is about to make a difference again.

20
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,372
Only this time, it's different.

21
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,792
Who left the fridge open?

22
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,171
Tugg Speedman.

23
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:31,967
Scorcher Vl: Global Meltdown.

24
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,886
Here we go again.

25
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:36,471
Again.

26
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,900
Will there be anything else?

27
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:51,195
Yes, my dear man. More beans.

28
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,199
Granny!

29
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,285
Please!

30
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:03,373
This summer, America's
favorite obese family is back.

31
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,794
Gross!

32
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,963
- You're just mad 'cause I'm skinny.
- Am not!

33
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:16,261
Jeff Portnoy.

34
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:22,392
And Jeff Portnoy are
The Fatties: Fart Two.

35
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,269
In some countries,

36
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,189
it's considered a compliment.

37
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,484
Letting loose this summer.

38
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:45,499
In a time where to be different
was to be condemned,

39
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:03,976
and to be condemned was to die,

40
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,276
one man chose to question his God.

41
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,990
From Fox Searchlight,

42
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:30,085
five-time Academy Award winner
Kirk Lazarus

43
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:35,465
and MTV Movie Award
Best Kiss winner Tobey Maguire.

44
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:46,393
Winner of the Beijing Film Festival's
coveted Crying Monkey Award,

45
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,563
Satan's Alley.

46
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,986
I've been a bad, bad boy, Father.

47
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,983
In the winter of 1969,

48
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,069
an elite force of the U. S. Army

49
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:42,074
was sent on a top-secret assignment
in southeast Vietnam.

50
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,868
The objective,
rescue Sergeant Four Leaf Tayback

51
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,080
from a heavily guarded
NVA Prison Camp.

52
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:51,291
The mission was considered
to be near suicide.

53
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,879
Of the 10 men sent, four returned.

54
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:59,383
Of those four, three wrote books
about what happened.

55
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,469
Of those three, two were published.

56
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:06,765
Of those two, just one got a movie deal.

57
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:13,480
This is the story of the men
who attempted to make that movie.

58
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,869
Whisky Fire Old Snake
requests an LZ prep

59
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,580
at Alpha-Delta-two-four-eight-niner,
over.

60
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:39,173
Floyd, this is lead. Right echelon
approach from RP to LZ, acknowledge.

61
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:41,967
Floyd, Wall-Eye airborne.
Welcome aboard.

62
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,598
All right, lead's going in.
Give her some cover.

63
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,475
Delivery on five.
I repeat, delivery on five.

64
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,984
This is Zero-Three.
I'm on your six, don't worry.

65
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,862
Chalk-Three's taking fire.
Guns right, guns right.

66
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,084
Lay that shit down!

67
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,503
Come on!

68
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,673
Come on, you damn dirty heathens!

69
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,802
Fats! Run your motherfucking ass
over there,

70
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,179
hold these men off, now!

71
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,972
We're fixing to lift off!

72
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,683
Put some pep in your step, dick!
Jelly-ass bitch!

73
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:35,103
Wall-Eye, Wall-Eye,
this is Boomer One-Seven in the Zee!

74
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,274
I need fast movers
on my Yankee Smoke, copy?

75
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,902
Boomer, this is Wall-Eye.
I got two-Alpha-four

76
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,196
- snake and nape on the ready!
- Oh, Jesus! Holy shit!

77
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,364
Holy shit!

78
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,366
Get on that horn
and get some firepower, boy!

79
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:48,367
Jesus Christ!

80
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,576
Listen, you cherry fuck,

81
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:53,163
you call in that snake and nape
and get us some boom-boom now!

82
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,666
I'd do it myself
but I'm kind of goddamn busy!

83
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,167
I need an answer, Boomer!

84
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,877
Wall-Eye, Wall-Eye!

85
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,671
I copy!

86
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,382
We got beaucoup zips in the zee.

87
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,967
Rock and roll!

88
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,885
What the fuck?

89
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,191
That's for Brooklyn, motherfucker!

90
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,193
I think I can put it back in!

91
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,070
We got to get back to the bird.

92
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,280
Lukemeyer's got popped!

93
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,283
This is the last Christmas
I spend with Victor Charlie up my ass!

94
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:32,202
Want some? Get some!

95
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,497
Hey, yo, Fats! I ain't seen Four Leaf!

96
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,792
Don't count him out! That bastard's
got luck tattooed to his ass!

97
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,879
Motown, get your Detroit jukebox
Jheri curl ass

98
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,173
in this chickenshit chop-chop! ASAFP!

99
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,175
Four Leaf is still
outside the perimeter, Sarge!

100
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,303
Miss me with that cracker chump jive!
We di di mau! We di di mau!

101
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,096
Come on, Sarge. Stop jiving.
Four Leaf is there.

102
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,890
Dead meat, soldier!

103
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,975
Or do you want to be a hero?

104
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,977
That's just how Brooks
got his Jew ass killed, man.

105
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,771
And Meatball's dago ass
bought the six-by-three farm.

106
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:03,567
Now get your ass up in the Huey, before
I stomp a trench in your hiney hole!

107
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,570
Come on, get down, get down!

108
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,780
What am I looking at? What is this?

109
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:13,577
Come on, let's get, let's go!
Come on, elevator up, up!

110
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,288
Sarge. It's Four Leaf.

111
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:29,593
No!

112
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,472
You get out of that hole!

113
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:47,402
You make it home, now.

114
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,078
Survive!

115
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,886
I hope y'all like hamburger meat.

116
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,097
'Cause that's exactly what
I'm gonna be bringing back

117
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,266
and serving up in this whirly bird.

118
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,768
Cover me, you limp dick fuckups!

119
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,694
Peek-a-boo! I see you!

120
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,364
Hold on, Four Leaf!

121
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,368
Oh, shit!

122
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,794
Watch my right!

123
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,465
Fuck you, Charlie!

124
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,764
Come on, Leaf, let's boogie!

125
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:07,774
No!

126
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:13,071
- Fats!
- Holy fuck!

127
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,867
Take us over to those men! Shit!

128
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,291
Look at you, man.
Playing with grenades.

129
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,087
I'm cold, Linc.

130
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,966
I can't feel my legs.

131
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,094
Ain't nothing but a thang.

132
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:40,974
Hey, Linc.

133
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,268
What, man?

134
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,688
Why does man

135
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:49,691
got to pick up sticks
against another man?

136
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:54,196
Instead of using them sticks to

137
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,199
prop a man up?

138
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,867
I'll never know.

139
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,371
Hold my hands,

140
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,373
'cause I got something to...

141
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,375
I got something to say.

142
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,503
Oh, boy.

143
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:16,301
- You holding 'em?
- I got 'em tight.

144
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:20,681
When we get back to the world,

145
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:25,269
we gonna put together that three-piece
combo band we talked about?

146
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:28,397
- Me on stand-up bass.
- Johnny on drums.

147
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,067
And me tickling the ivories.

148
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:37,406
I ain't never been worth a nothing
in this life,

149
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:40,200
but I want you to know something.

150
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:42,703
What, man?

151
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:45,873
You are my...

152
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,084
You are my brother.

153
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:07,102
You are my brother.
You are my... You are my...

154
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:08,896
I am your brother.

155
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,067
I'm sorry. Could we cut?

156
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:15,694
- What's he saying?
- Damien, can we cut?

157
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,404
- No. No, no, no, no, no...
- All right, you know what?

158
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,574
We got the jets coming in,
big explosion, two minutes.

159
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:21,783
Still rolling.

160
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,493
You know what? No, not still rolling.
Can we cut?

161
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,287
- We're cutting.
- No, we're not. Get out!

162
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,372
Hey, what's going on?
For real, my butt is hurting!

163
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,291
This harness is riding up my crack!

164
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,085
- Damien, are we cutting?
- No! No! Still rolling!

165
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,379
Mr. Cockburn! Are we cutting, sir?

166
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:37,591
No! No. I'm not cutting!
We're still rolling!

167
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:38,800
Damien, what's the dealy, dude?

168
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,677
Are we gonna blow
this tree line or what?

169
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,387
Tuk Tuk and Kim
got the blue balls here.

170
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:43,680
I'm gonna let them squirt if we're a go!

171
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,974
- Play it through. Still rolling!
- Dieter, can he hear me?

172
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,685
That's C-4, dipshit. Put that back.
I said a detonator.

173
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,188
I need some dudes up here
who speak American, God damn it!

174
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,773
He's making
a fucking sweater back here.

175
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:55,192
I'm trying to put Tiger Balm
on this jungle's nuts.

176
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,485
Everyone, please shut up.

177
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,695
The jets are coming in.
We only have one chance at this!

178
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,197
And go!

179
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,574
Let's do it. You feel it? You feel me?

180
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,994
- You are my...
- I am your brother.

181
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,288
We've seen it all, man.

182
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:10,082
I'm sorry, Damien?

183
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:11,500
Are you seeing that?

184
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,669
The little froggy on the boom mike?
It's right in my eyeline.

185
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,589
Donny! What's up, man?

186
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:19,174
It's been there the whole show.

187
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,384
Yeah, well it's right in my face,

188
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,593
I'm staring at a frog, I'm trying to feel...

189
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:24,179
It's always the yellow frog that
brings them black frog on Fridays, man.

190
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,973
Hell, no, I didn't pee on that girl.

191
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:28,183
No, I didn't pee on her,
listen, listen, listen, listen. No, no.

192
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:30,769
The story is this. She was in the way
when I was peeing, she walked past.

193
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,272
What the fuck is going on here?

194
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:35,482
On three, baby. One, two, breathe.

195
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:38,193
Look, do me a favor. I don't want to do
a countdown before I do the scene.

196
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:39,403
- No countdown?
- No countdown.

197
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,696
- Okay.
- Can we just do it off of "Action"?

198
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,406
Just... ln your own time.

199
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,199
- Good...
- I'm not a rocket ship, okay?

200
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:45,868
- All right, dude.
- And action!

201
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,996
Whatever floats your boat, baby.
Fuck! Don't die!

202
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,498
Erika, get me a Vitamin Water!

203
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:53,083
You know what it is, Damien? I'm sorry.

204
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:57,588
Not to get into his thing, but if
I'm crying, should Osiris be crying, too?

205
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,590
- No, it's everyone cry...
- We cutting or we crying?

206
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:00,966
- No, no, no, we're crying!
- Just call it, man!

207
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,302
- Kirk, you can cry. Tugg, you can cry.
- Thanks!

208
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,095
- Everybody cry...
- You know what?

209
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,181
- You see how agitated he is now?
- I know.

210
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:09,683
- Let's make lemonade. Let's go to work.
- Okay. Still rolling!

211
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:12,769
This is Falcon One. We have the ridge
in sight, approximately two miles out.

212
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:15,105
Dieter, these jets
are about to crest this ridge line.

213
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:17,191
They got about 200 pounds
of shit your pants.

214
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:18,400
I need to know if we're ready to go.

215
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,405
- You're my... You're my...
- I am your...

216
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,992
See, that's what I think it is, Damien.
I think it's the line.

217
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,076
Yeah?

218
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:30,078
I don't know if Four Leaf
would say that... Four Leaf?

219
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:32,498
Were you crying
when your hands blew up?

220
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,208
No. See, he didn't.
Yeah, I mean, just that's what...

221
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,876
So now we in re-writes, right?

222
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,169
- Where you going?
- Let's re-write it!

223
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:39,379
Action Jackson can't cry.
That's what's going down.

224
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,507
You know what, Kirk?
I'm ready to do the scene!

225
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:45,177
What scene? The scene is
about emotionality. Where is it?

226
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:46,803
- Now it's time to flip the script!
- Kirk...

227
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:49,097
Be here till Chinese New Year
waiting for my man to cry.

228
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,308
You're tangling me,
you're fucking tangling me.

229
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,601
You're tangling me, God damn it!

230
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,479
- Kirk, no!
- Stop tailgating me, you pasty tea bag!

231
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,397
I'm going potty.
You want to hold my dick?

232
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,692
Shit! What are you fucking both doing,
Good Lord!

233
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:03,403
We're getting this in a wide shot, right?

234
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,988
Of course we're getting it
in a fucking wide.

235
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:06,073
What, do you think
I'm a dick or something?

236
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:07,908
Get that fucking food...

237
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,368
Here they come!

238
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:12,871
- The planes are inbound!
- Shit! Shit!

239
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:17,876
Shit, shit, cocksucker, bollocks.
Tropic tits!

240
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:21,004
That's the signal! Go, go, go, go, go!

241
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,090
Let's go freaking Tet here!

242
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,175
Goddamn shit-picking cock!

243
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:28,971
That's my shit!

244
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:37,396
Mother Nature just pissed her pantsuit!

245
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,405
- Sweet.
- Oh, mama!

246
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:51,577
Bungle in the jungle.

247
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:54,788
More bad news from the Vietnamese set
of Tropic Thunder,

248
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:58,667
where a $4 million explosion
charred the Asian location

249
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,669
and the camera wasn't even rolling.

250
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,505
Financed by hotheaded mega-mogul
Les Grossman,

251
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:06,675
the film is already rumored to be
one month behind schedule

252
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:09,678
just five days into shooting.
The reason?

253
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,681
Fingers are pointed at rookie director
Damien Cockburn,

254
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,767
who, insiders say,
can't control a star-studded cast,

255
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:20,689
including flatulent star of the popular
Fatties franchise, Jeff Portnoy.

256
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,275
Let me tell you something.
A lot of people are disrespecting me.

257
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,196
They say that the movie's
just about farts. It's about family,

258
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,407
and... you! You can't do what I do.

259
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:34,703
Fresh from his most recent arrest
for heroin, glue and crack possession,

260
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,206
Portnoy was almost uninsurable.

261
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:41,585
Also in the mix is Booty Sweat-hocking
hip-hop hyphenate Alpa Chino.

262
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,171
I'm so excited, you know what I'm
saying, about doing Tropic Thunder.

263
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:46,507
Hey, drink Booty Sweat, baby.
Drink Booty Sweat.

264
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:48,175
But the real heavyweight on the set

265
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,969
is five-time Academy Award winner
Kirk Lazarus.

266
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:54,890
The brilliant Australian
known for his bad boy antics off-screen

267
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:58,477
is famous for his total immersion
into any role he portrays.

268
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,978
Well, being an actor is no different

269
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,272
than being a rugby player
or a construction worker,

270
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,607
save for the fact that my tools

271
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:05,692
are the mechanisms
that trigger human emotion.

272
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:07,903
Lazarus underwent a controversial

273
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:10,989
pigmentation alteration procedure
in order to play

274
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:14,076
the platoon's African-American
sergeant, Lincoln Osiris.

275
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,702
Yeah!

276
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,704
Trying to hold his own onscreen
with Kirk

277
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,873
is action juggernaut Tugg Speedman.

278
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,793
Once the highest grossing star
in the world,

279
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,004
lately his Scorcher films
have lost their heat.

280
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:28,674
Recently, Speedman opened up to Tyra.

281
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:30,676
You have no real family.

282
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:35,305
You're on the wrong side of 40.
You're childless and alone.

283
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,099
Somebody close to you said,

284
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:39,893
"One more flop and it's over. "

285
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:44,189
Somebody said they were close to me?

286
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:46,275
It's been a tough year for Tugg.

287
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:49,069
The disappointing buddy comedy
Chitlin' & the Dude

288
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:53,907
was followed by an ill-advised venture
into serious dramatic territory.

289
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,075
Simple Jack,

290
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,871
the story of a mentally impaired
farmhand who can talk to animals,

291
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,873
was a box office disaster

292
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:05,586
that many critics called,
"One of the worst movies of all time. "

293
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:09,298
I ain't got a good brain.

294
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,177
I think you've got a fine brain, Jack.

295
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:18,473
You make me happy.

296
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:24,479
But now the question is,
can Speedman make audiences happy

297
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:26,273
in what's being called
the most expensive

298
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:28,692
- war movie never made?
- Rick Peck.

299
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,277
Wishing Tugg all the best on that one.

300
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:34,698
Rum-Tum-Tuggernauts, it's the Pecker.
You got time for your agent?

301
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,074
- Rick?
- Hey, buddy,

302
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,784
guess who I'm staring at right now.

303
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,578
- What?
- I'm looking at your ugly mug

304
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:41,997
on the back cover
of Vanity Fair magazine,

305
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,500
holding a cute, cuddly panda
from Cutesville.

306
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,169
It is insane, bro. You are a rock star.

307
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,880
Hey, did you get the gift basket I sent?

308
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,006
From Rick.

309
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,175
Yeah. Yeah. It's cool, man. Thanks.

310
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,886
All right,
that is a real satellite phone, bro.

311
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,596
Do not re-gift.

312
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,182
Hey. You see
that Access Hollywood piece?

313
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:03,310
Yeah, I did.
It was like pistol-whipping a blind kid.

314
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:07,773
I mean, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,
Tugg. You are a huge star, all right?

315
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:09,274
But right now,

316
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,984
you're like that kid on the playground,
you know,

317
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:14,071
the one who has lice that none
of the other kids want to play with?

318
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:16,198
- What do you mean?
- I mean we gotta shave your head

319
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,784
and get you back
on the monkey bars, right?

320
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,202
What?

321
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,204
How did the crying scene go?

322
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:23,997
Horrible. Lazarus started crying.

323
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:27,292
Then he starts drooling and dribbling,
and it wasn't even in the script...

324
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:28,502
Stop right there!

325
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,379
You gotta buck up here, Tuggboat.

326
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:33,090
Who cares how much more talented
he may be than you?

327
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:36,593
If he cries, you cry harder, man.

328
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:38,887
Didn't your dog have, like, leukemia
or something

329
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:40,389
when you were a kid?
I mean, think of that.

330
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:44,184
Boom! End of story.
They hook up the TiVo yet?

331
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:45,602
Good gosh.

332
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,604
- What?
- The TiVo, they hook it up?

333
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,898
- No. The guy didn't come.
- What?

334
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:52,609
For fuck's sake, that is unacceptable.

335
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:54,570
They have digital cable, but,
I mean, it's okay.

336
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,905
No, no, no. Come on, man. It's not okay.

337
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:59,074
It is not okay, Tugg!

338
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:02,411
And you don't need to explain to me
why you need TiVo

339
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:06,373
or clean water, clean sheets,
food, shelter.

340
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:09,710
I mean, I fought for that in your contract.

341
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,795
How's the adoption thing coming,
buddy?

342
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,881
Not too great.

343
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:19,887
I feel like all the good ones are gone.

344
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,807
Well, at least you get to choose yours.

345
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:25,809
I'm stuck with mine.

346
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:30,272
Tell you what, get back to work,
genius soldier.

347
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:33,192
The Pecker's on a TiVo mission
for the Y-O-U.

348
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,110
Work on those tears, my man.

349
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:36,278
All right. Yeah.

350
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,905
Say it for me one time.

351
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:42,284
- You make me happy.
- Make me happy.

352
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,994
- I love you, buddy.
- All right, bye.

353
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,872
Crisis meeting?
What does that mean, exactly?

354
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,707
I mean, are we in a crisis?

355
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,292
He's the head of the studio.

356
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,711
He's reaching out.
We're 10,000 miles away.

357
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:54,004
He just wants a little face-time.

358
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,673
I know, it's just you said
that he called it a crisis meeting. So...

359
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,176
It's Les Grossman.
He throws these words around.

360
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:03,680
"Crisis, " "explosion, "
"not rolling, " "fired. "

361
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:05,098
These are just words.

362
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:07,309
Yeah! Yeah!

363
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:10,687
Keep a secret? A camera truck in
London just ploughed into Judi Dench.

364
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:11,897
Trust me, he's got bigger problems.

365
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,483
Look, he may be able to see me,
but I can't see him.

366
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:19,071
- Move! Move! Hello, Les! Hello!
- Get your ass out of my...

367
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,697
- Your feet were on my desk.
- Can he see us?

368
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,074
I don't know why we don't have...

369
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:24,409
Get him a Diet Coke. Les! It's working!

370
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:26,995
Yeah, whatever you're doing right there.
Hello, Les!

371
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,497
- Hello, Les!
- Okay.

372
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,707
We got you loud and clear here, Les.

373
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,503
I see you. I see you. I see you.

374
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:37,673
Which one of you fuckfaces
is Damien Cockburn?

375
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:40,175
That's me, sir.

376
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,887
It's good to finally meet you at last,
get some face-time.

377
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:47,975
And who here is the key grip?
You? You.

378
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:53,480
Hit that director in the face,
really fucking hard.

379
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,697
Sorry, man.

380
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:10,998
This is your fault, you limey fuck!

381
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:13,000
You shit the money-bed, my friend.

382
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,711
- What?
- God damn it, Damien!

383
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:18,797
With all due respect, Les Grossman did
not blow up the jungle.

384
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:20,007
- What?
- Fuck the jungle.

385
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:21,508
Exactly!

386
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:23,677
Come on, man.

387
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:27,097
Hey, Les, I understand if you're angry,

388
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:29,183
but I am dealing
with a bunch of prima donnas!

389
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:32,811
Clowns! Tugg Speedman, he can't cry!
He can't cry!

390
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:35,272
You know how you handle an actor?
They whine about anything,

391
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:38,692
you pull down their pants
and you spank their ass.

392
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,986
- You spank that ass, Les.
- What?

393
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:44,907
Spanking a child
turns him into a little snot.

394
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:48,702
Fear makes him a man.

395
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:54,291
I know a place
where a man's worth is measured

396
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:58,212
in the ears hanging from his dog tags.

397
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:01,006
The real deep shit.

398
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,675
You wanna make this movie right?

399
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:07,387
That's where you take
your pansy-ass actors.

400
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:10,807
Who is this guy?

401
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:12,809
Les, that's Four Leaf.

402
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:16,271
Sergeant Four Leaf Tayback.
I wrote the book.

403
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:22,486
You're a great American.
This nation owes you a huge debt.

404
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:25,572
Now shut the fuck up
and let me do my job!

405
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,908
- Look, Cockburn.
- Yes.

406
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:31,995
From now on, my fist
is gonna be so far up your shithole

407
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,497
that every time you have a thought,

408
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,583
it's gonna have to tiptoe
past my wedding ring.

409
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:40,212
Take control of your actors,
or I will shut you down.

410
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:41,505
Diet Coke!

411
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:01,400
One week down, two weeks behind,

412
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:05,279
GI Joe can't cry, don't matter 'cause you
ain't got the camera turned on anyway.

413
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:06,780
Let's party!

414
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,575
Man, you better get your shit straight,

415
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:12,703
or I'll be on the next NetJet out of here,
baby. You feel me?

416
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:14,496
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

417
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,207
Here comes another.
There we go. Now what?

418
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,793
- Sandusky. Good.
- Hey, Mr. Cockburn.

419
00:24:19,877 --> 00:24:21,795
We need to have a cast meeting
right now.

420
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:23,172
- Right now? Awesome.
- Yes.

421
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:24,506
You actually care, don't you?

422
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:27,176
Yeah, it's a huge deal for me,
are you kidding?

423
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:29,303
I've spent the past two years of my life

424
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:32,973
living off residuals from a anti-herpes
medication commercial.

425
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:34,308
I know, you're the only one
who auditioned,

426
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:35,976
the only one who did
the two-week boot camp.

427
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:37,811
Hey, hey, Alpa.

428
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,898
I'm the director. He's...
I need to speak to my actor.

429
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:42,274
All right, hold up. Chino?

430
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:44,193
What? Hell, yo. What's up, baby?

431
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:46,612
This about
the Booty Sweat cross-promotion?

432
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:47,696
No, it's about the film.

433
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,907
Oh, the film and Booty Sweat's
the same thing. Give him a shot.

434
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:52,284
Hey, how you doing, Jeff?

435
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:55,913
- Who are you?
- That's awesome, man.

436
00:24:58,207 --> 00:25:02,878
Kevin. Kevin Sandusky. I play Brooklyn,
we've been working together.

437
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:04,588
Oh, right, right. I like you.

438
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,673
Man, it's a real honor to be here...

439
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:08,008
I can tell it's gonna be
a good experience.

440
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:09,301
I'm really having a good time.

441
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:11,011
Hey, can you help me out, man?
I'm looking for this guy.

442
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:15,307
The grip with the bandana.
He's got a package for me.

443
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:18,185
There he is, fucker. Dragon!

444
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:21,104
What the fuck? Oh, buddy!

445
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:22,606
I'm gonna go shoot a video, right?

446
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:24,775
I'm gonna have V. C. Soldiers
in the video

447
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,193
doing the noodle-legs, Damien.

448
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:30,697
Hell, yeah, do it. V. C. Soldiers doing
the hip-hop bunny hop, Damien.

449
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:32,574
It's good, I love it, great. But I need to...

450
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:35,702
V. C. Soldiers doing the seizure, baby.
Hit it, baby.

451
00:25:35,786 --> 00:25:37,496
Hell yeah, get it. Get it, Cornbread.

452
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:40,874
Alpa!

453
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:42,376
Yo, check it out. Donny on the phone.

454
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:43,502
Hello? Yo, yo, Donny!

455
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:45,712
Can we call him back?
I've got to have a cast meeting.

456
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:51,510
When we put aside our differences,

457
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:54,513
we see we're kind of the same.

458
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:58,892
When we put aside our differences,
we see

459
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:02,396
we're kind of the same.

460
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:05,107
Let's be friends.

461
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:07,901
I know we can do great things together.

462
00:26:10,112 --> 00:26:13,782
That's a quotation from
a children's book I co-wrote,

463
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,702
The Boy Everybody Was Jealous Of.

464
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:18,579
I think it pertains to the journey...

465
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:19,997
Simple Jack sucked ass!

466
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,375
All right, who said that? It's not funny.

467
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:25,294
Whoever it is, it's not funny, okay?

468
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:35,304
When the herd loses its way,

469
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:39,892
the shepherd must kill
the bull that leads them astray.

470
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:44,980
- Four Leaf?
- Come on over. It's okay.

471
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:48,108
- Sit down.
- Yes.

472
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:54,573
- So, you don't like the hotel?
- Beds give me nightmares.

473
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:04,875
I'm guessing right about now
you couldn't find a Dixie coonskin

474
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,296
with an Ohio hooker holding your prick
and showing you the way.

475
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:17,513
What?

476
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,306
You're a riddle

477
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:23,810
with no cheese to maze through.

478
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:26,688
Don't you get it?

479
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:30,484
No, I don't. I'm a cock of the mouse
or something. I don't know.

480
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:34,488
I put my story in your limp Brit hands,

481
00:27:34,613 --> 00:27:37,991
and you are not going to fail me.

482
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:41,703
You think I was just blowing
my own bagpipe in that meeting?

483
00:27:41,912 --> 00:27:45,707
You must put those boys in the shit.

484
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,292
What? I don't understand.

485
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:50,712
- You wanna make your movie or not?
- Yes, I do.

486
00:27:50,796 --> 00:27:54,299
All right, you get
some of those little video type cameras.

487
00:27:54,383 --> 00:27:58,011
We take them out there, and we put
them in the trees in different angles.

488
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:01,515
Then you give me
and that pyromaniac Cody

489
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:06,478
all the smoke bombs, charges,
explosives, detonators you got.

490
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:08,981
Then we take those boys up there,

491
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:12,192
me and Cody,
we could light up that fucking jungle,

492
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:15,195
so those lily-dick actors
would be shitting their pants

493
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:17,406
and screaming for their mammies.

494
00:28:17,406 --> 00:28:20,909
They'd be begging for a body bag
if it means a ride home.

495
00:28:23,704 --> 00:28:25,289
I could do it.

496
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:29,501
I could shoot the whole thing
guerrilla style. Gritty, dirty.

497
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:32,880
Get them away from their helpers
and ass-licking assistants.

498
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:34,089
Put them in the real shit.

499
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,382
- Real shit.
- With real fear in their eyes!

500
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:38,594
Real fear, real emotion!
Yes, Four Leaf, yes!

501
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:40,804
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

502
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:42,681
Take them off the fucking grid!

503
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:02,910
You are no longer actors in a movie!

504
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:06,705
You are five men in a helicopter!

505
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:10,292
With three other men!

506
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:17,382
How long are we gonna be gone,
anyways?

507
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:21,595
'Cause I left most of my vitamins
back at the hotel.

508
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:24,306
- Save your breath, maggots!
- That's right, maggots!

509
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:40,781
M&M?

510
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:03,303
Go, go, go! Get out of the chopper!

511
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:07,808
Move it, maggots, move!
Move, grunts, move your ass!

512
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:10,102
Get out, you wriggly worms!

513
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:12,688
- It's up too high!
- Move, move, move!

514
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:17,985
See you in hell!

515
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:33,709
This is bullshit!
I gotta at least call my fucking assistant.

516
00:30:34,877 --> 00:30:37,588
Fucking! Jesus! Dude!

517
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:41,300
You're sitting on a nest
of hostile enemy V. C.

518
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:44,887
Congratulations, Fats.
You just got us all killed.

519
00:30:45,888 --> 00:30:49,516
Anybody else care to give away
our position to Charlie?

520
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:51,310
Cell phones!

521
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:52,895
What the hell, Damien?

522
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:56,690
Weren't no cell phones in '69, man.
I'm head-to-toe legitimate.

523
00:30:56,815 --> 00:31:00,194
Gentlemen, I've got good news
and bad news.

524
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:03,780
The studio wants to shut us down.
That's the bad news.

525
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:06,283
And the good news.

526
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:09,286
If you wanna save this movie,
you will become a unit.

527
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:13,207
Your objective is to head north
to the D'ang Kwook River

528
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:14,708
and liberate the POW camp,

529
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:18,086
at which point Four Leaf
will get himself captured,

530
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:20,005
at which point you will rescue him,

531
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:23,509
at which point
we will chopper you home!

532
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:25,802
Damn.

533
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:27,679
Four Leaf,
since you're the staff sergeant,

534
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:30,182
there's the map, this is the scene list.

535
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:32,392
Think you can handle it?

536
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:36,813
We have rigged this entire
valley of death with hidden cameras.

537
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,777
And I will be shooting as well,
from unseen vantage points,

538
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:45,489
so that every glorious moment
is captured on film.

539
00:31:46,782 --> 00:31:49,993
And believe me, gentlemen,
it will be glorious.

540
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:52,579
If it looks real,
chances are it probably is.

541
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:54,289
You wanted to be actors.

542
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:57,000
You wanted to occupy
the skin of another human being.

543
00:31:57,084 --> 00:32:00,087
Well, get ready to occupy the skin
of a terrified U. S. Infantry grunt,

544
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:04,007
surrounded by death,
crawling up Satan's bottom.

545
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:09,680
There'll be ambushes, enemy fire,
your own little personal slice of 'Nam.

546
00:32:09,805 --> 00:32:14,393
This radio goes to the chopper
and the chopper only.

547
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:18,981
The chopper is God,
and I am Jesus Christ, his son.

548
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:21,817
You are my chosen disciples.

549
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:24,903
And no one gets to go home
till we get the shots.

550
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:28,115
Put on your war faces, gentlemen.

551
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:32,911
Now, let's go and make
the greatest war movie ever!

552
00:32:32,995 --> 00:32:35,289
- Yeah!
- All right!

553
00:32:54,016 --> 00:33:01,607
Yeah!

554
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:16,079
Not bad, Cockburn!

555
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:19,082
Not bad.

556
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:22,377
Wherever you are!

557
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:27,508
Wherever he is?
Looks like he's all over the place.

558
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:31,178
Here we go.

559
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:33,305
Must be an old French mine.

560
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:36,892
It's a remnant from colonial Indo-China.
This jungle must be full of them.

561
00:33:38,894 --> 00:33:42,397
Don't you get it?
He's messing with our heads.

562
00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:44,608
That's what all that
playing God stuff was about.

563
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:47,194
He's trying to get us to act good,
save the movie.

564
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:50,405
He ain't playing God.
He's being judged by him.

565
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:57,079
That's our objective.
Complete the mission.

566
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:06,213
No offense, Kirk,
I know you're the big fancy actor here,

567
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:10,217
but I've done a lot more effects-driven
event films than you. Okay?

568
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:11,718
And I think I can spot

569
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:15,305
a prop head when I see one.

570
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,890
Oh, Jesus.

571
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,603
It's corn syrup, guys.
Corn syrup and latex.

572
00:34:24,815 --> 00:34:27,985
Warm, blood-flavored corn syrup.

573
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,194
Oh, God.

574
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:32,990
Smoke and mirrors, guys.
Welcome to the movie factory.

575
00:34:33,115 --> 00:34:34,283
Oldest trick in the book.

576
00:34:36,285 --> 00:34:37,578
He getting down now.

577
00:34:37,703 --> 00:34:38,996
Oh, my God!

578
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,917
Whoa, look at me!

579
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:45,502
You're going to get the shots,

580
00:34:45,586 --> 00:34:48,589
and I'm going to make sure
because I'm the director.

581
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:50,799
I'm from London. I direct plays.

582
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:54,011
Hey, Damien! We got our war faces on!

583
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:05,689
Look, I'm Dave Beckham.

584
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:17,701
So, we gotta
light these boys up today, huh?

585
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:19,995
Blow some sense into these young men.

586
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:23,916
Hey, I don't want to come off
as weird or anything,

587
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:27,878
but I might be your biggest fan. Yeah.

588
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:32,799
Tropic Thunder.
Kind of like my Catcher in the Rye.

589
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:36,178
Yeah, I've never been in the military,
per se,

590
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:38,805
but I have lost an appendage
in the line of duty.

591
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:42,809
Driving Miss Daisy, first studio gig.

592
00:35:43,602 --> 00:35:44,686
Yeah.

593
00:35:45,187 --> 00:35:47,981
It's a pretty cool sidearm you got there.
What is it?

594
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:49,816
I don't know what it's called.

595
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:55,614
I just know the sound it makes
when it takes a man's life.

596
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,910
Okay.

597
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,578
Damien, we're go for explosion.

598
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:04,498
Ready to kick the tires
and light the fires on your say-so.

599
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:06,416
Damien, we're go for explosion.

600
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:08,502
Do you copy?

601
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:11,505
I got an itchy trigger finger here,
and I'm ready to blow some shit up.

602
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:15,217
All right, you happy now?
Can we do the scene?

603
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:18,011
Or do you need a formal invitation?
Come on, let's go!

604
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:20,889
Here. Okay.

605
00:36:21,014 --> 00:36:23,183
"Scene 12, exterior,
jungle clearing, day, ambush.

606
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:30,607
"Four Leaf notices
movement in the brush.

607
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:33,819
"A dozen guerrilla fighters
can be seen moving in the tree line.

608
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:36,488
"Somewhere a mine explodes. "
And you.

609
00:36:37,781 --> 00:36:39,783
"I got a bad feeling on this one. "

610
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:41,410
- Yeah.
- No, that's your line.

611
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:44,413
- I got... Now?
- Yeah, but scared. Like, scared.

612
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:47,207
- "I got a bad feeling on this one. "
- Dude, wait, like how?

613
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:49,209
"I got a bad feeling on this one. "

614
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:51,420
- Okay.
- Action. Go, come on.

615
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:03,307
I got a bad feeling
on this one there, Fats.

616
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,020
Our asses don't get fragged
in this bullshit valley,

617
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:09,897
first thing I'm doing
is paying my two bucks

618
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,690
so I can watch Brooklyn bust his cherry

619
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:14,485
on a sweet little mama-san's
dinky dau poontang.

620
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:17,488
Shit, Brooklyn be bagged and tagged
before he get any cooch.

621
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:20,782
He die, he probably die
a coochless motherfucker.

622
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:22,284
Zip it, Motown.

623
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:23,994
Don't you worry, Brooklyn.

624
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,205
You got a lot of days of fucking
ahead of you.

625
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:29,917
Man, I'm thirsty.

626
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:36,006
Might as well have some of this
Booty Sweat I got back in Danang.

627
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:40,302
Yo, asshole! This motherfucker's dead!

628
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:42,179
Ain't no Criss Angel Mindfreak,

629
00:37:42,304 --> 00:37:45,599
David Blaine trapdoor
horseshit jumping off here!

630
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:49,520
Hey! You wanna get on the train here,
or do you wanna ruin another take?

631
00:37:49,603 --> 00:37:52,981
There ain't no goddamn takes,
ain't no goddamn motion picture!

632
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:55,692
- You sure?
- Yeah.

633
00:37:55,818 --> 00:37:57,611
- Yeah?
- For certain, man.

634
00:37:57,611 --> 00:37:59,613
Then why are you still in character?

635
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:03,116
I know, but I don't have to tell you.

636
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:05,285
You don't know.

637
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,413
Man, I don't drop character
till I done a DVD commentary.

638
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:13,293
You happy now?
We're out of position for the effects!

639
00:38:13,418 --> 00:38:15,212
Get down, fool!

640
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:19,716
Didn't anyone read the script?
This is the ambush!

641
00:38:21,093 --> 00:38:24,805
- This feels pretty real!
- Exactly! Let's use it.

642
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:39,194
Yeah!

643
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,115
Eat lead!

644
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,411
They're busting caps
like a motherfucker down there.

645
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:52,791
This is FUBAR. I say we juice them.

646
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:54,418
- What do you think?
- Juice them.

647
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:59,298
Fuck you, Charlie!

648
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:02,885
Big-ass titties!

649
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:10,517
Look at that, huh?

650
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:16,899
And cut!

651
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:20,986
That's the trailer right there.

652
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:22,404
Yeah!

653
00:39:22,613 --> 00:39:24,781
- What do we do now?
- Yeah.

654
00:39:24,907 --> 00:39:26,408
North. Man said to head north.

655
00:39:26,617 --> 00:39:29,912
- Did you see me shooting?
- That's how we do. Good work, baby.

656
00:39:29,912 --> 00:39:30,996
I believed it.

657
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:32,289
D'ang Kwook River.

658
00:39:32,915 --> 00:39:34,291
I'm betting
he's got more of these battles

659
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:37,211
and Viet Congs
rigged for us along the way.

660
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:41,089
Sergeant Osiris, get your men.
Load and lock.

661
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:43,509
Real, baby, I'm real.

662
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:47,304
Let's go! We got a lot of klicks to cover!

663
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:51,517
Hump it up, gentlemen!
Single formation.

664
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,519
Don't dawdle now!

665
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:21,880
D-Rod, D-Rod, this is Puddingface.
How are we coming on that hotplate?

666
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:27,803
Something's up.
I think we better drag ass back there.

667
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:30,597
Make sure Damien ain't forgot
how to use his talkbox again.

668
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:41,316
Yeah, baby, come on. Just a little taste.

669
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:45,112
- What are you doing, Jeff?
- Fucking... Nothing, man!

670
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:48,490
- I'm eating jellybeans.
- Wow, I love jellybeans. Can I please...

671
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:51,285
No, you can't have
any fucking jellybeans.

672
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,494
They're mine.

673
00:40:52,703 --> 00:40:53,787
You think
you're the only one who gets sick

674
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:55,581
when he doesn't have his jellybeans?

675
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:57,082
Boundaries, man. Fuck.

676
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:19,688
Hey. I didn't mean to
show you up back there.

677
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:23,901
It's just, I feel like we really need
to set the example for the other guys.

678
00:41:23,984 --> 00:41:25,903
It's gonna be tough,

679
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:29,114
but I think Damien's gonna get
some great shit out of us.

680
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:32,409
Just wish I had
a director like this on Jack.

681
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:34,912
On Jack. What? Jack?
What you talking about?

682
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:38,081
- Simple Jack.
- Oh, yeah.

683
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:42,920
Simple Jack, yeah.
You went all out on that one, huh?

684
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:45,214
You did.
Really swung for the fences, huh?

685
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:47,716
Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.

686
00:41:47,883 --> 00:41:50,719
Yeah, it was an intense experience,
you know.

687
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:53,514
I just did the work.

688
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:57,518
Watched a lot of retarded people.
Spent time with them. Observed them.

689
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:00,896
Watched all the retarded stuff they did.

690
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:02,814
Then again,
I always found mere observation

691
00:42:02,898 --> 00:42:05,192
in and of itself is a tad rudimentary.

692
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:08,320
Sometimes, we gotta dig deeper
to mine the true emotional pay dirt.

693
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:12,783
Thus, we can diagram the source
of the pain and then live it, you know.

694
00:42:12,908 --> 00:42:14,993
Yeah, yeah, live it. Yeah, exactly.

695
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:17,788
You know, there were times
when I was doing Jack

696
00:42:17,913 --> 00:42:20,415
that I actually felt retarded,

697
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:21,792
- like really retarded.
- Oh, yeah.

698
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:24,211
I mean, I brushed my teeth retarded,

699
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:26,004
- I rode the bus retarded.
- Damn.

700
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:29,383
In a weird way,
I had to sort of just free myself up

701
00:42:29,508 --> 00:42:32,511
to believe that it was okay
to be stupid or dumb.

702
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:34,096
- To be a moron.
- Yeah.

703
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:37,015
- To be moronical.
- Exactly, to be a moron.

704
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:38,392
- An imbecile.
- Yeah.

705
00:42:38,517 --> 00:42:41,395
Like the dumbest motherfucker
that ever lived.

706
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,688
When I was playing the character.

707
00:42:42,813 --> 00:42:45,315
- When you was the character.
- Yeah, as Jack, definitely.

708
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:47,693
Jack, stupid ass Jack.

709
00:42:47,818 --> 00:42:48,986
Trying to come back from that.

710
00:42:49,111 --> 00:42:53,282
In a weird way it was almost like
I had to sort of fool my mind

711
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:56,410
into believing that it wasn't retarded,

712
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,203
and by the end of the whole thing,
I was like,

713
00:42:58,287 --> 00:43:02,791
"Wait a minute, I flushed so much out,
how am I gonna jumpstart it up again?"

714
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:05,002
- It's just like... Right?
- Yeah.

715
00:43:05,085 --> 00:43:07,921
You was farting in bathtubs
and laughing your ass off.

716
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:09,798
Yeah.

717
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:12,217
But Simple Jack thought he was smart,

718
00:43:12,301 --> 00:43:13,594
or rather, didn't think he was retarded,

719
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:16,597
so you can't afford to play retarded,
being a smart actor.

720
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:19,183
Playing a guy who ain't smart
but thinks he is,

721
00:43:19,308 --> 00:43:20,893
- that's tricky.
- Tricky.

722
00:43:21,018 --> 00:43:24,605
It's like working with mercury.
It's high science, man. It's an art form.

723
00:43:24,605 --> 00:43:26,690
- Yeah.
- You an artist.

724
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:28,609
- That's what we do, right? Yeah.
- Yeah.

725
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:29,985
Hats off for going there,

726
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,821
especially knowing how
the Academy is about that shit.

727
00:43:36,492 --> 00:43:39,995
- About what?
- You're serious? You don't know?

728
00:43:42,206 --> 00:43:44,291
Everybody knows
you never go full retard.

729
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,920
- What do you mean?
- Check it out.

730
00:43:48,003 --> 00:43:52,216
Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man, looked
retarded, act retarded, not retarded.

731
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:56,386
Count toothpicks, cheat at cards.
Autistic, sure. Not retarded.

732
00:43:57,221 --> 00:43:59,097
Then you got Tom Hanks,
Forrest Gump.

733
00:43:59,223 --> 00:44:01,517
Slow, yes, retarded, maybe,
braces on his legs.

734
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,520
But he charmed the pants off Nixon,
and he won a Ping-Pong competition.

735
00:44:04,603 --> 00:44:05,604
That ain't retarded.

736
00:44:05,687 --> 00:44:09,691
And he was a goddamn war hero.
You know any retarded war heroes?

737
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,695
You went full retard, man.

738
00:44:15,197 --> 00:44:16,615
Never go full retard.

739
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:21,119
You don't buy that?
Ask Sean Penn, 2001, I Am Sam.

740
00:44:21,203 --> 00:44:24,498
Remember? Went full retard?
Went home empty-handed.

741
00:44:34,383 --> 00:44:37,594
Oh, my God! Holy shit!

742
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,889
Good job, turd. You killed the director.

743
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:42,307
No, that's impossible, man.

744
00:44:42,391 --> 00:44:45,310
I rigged the whole tree line,
and this is here.

745
00:44:45,394 --> 00:44:46,895
- He must have missed his mark.
- Missed his mark?

746
00:44:47,104 --> 00:44:48,313
Yeah, this isn't me.

747
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:51,191
Come on, let's bag and tag the bastard
and get back to the hotel.

748
00:44:51,316 --> 00:44:53,986
- You're in a world of hurt, dumbo!
- We're in a world of hurt!

749
00:44:54,111 --> 00:44:56,321
- You're in trouble.
- This isnt just on me!

750
00:44:56,405 --> 00:44:58,615
- We're in a... We're together on this.
- Bullshit.

751
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:00,200
You're just gonna run away.
You're gonna leave.

752
00:45:00,284 --> 00:45:01,910
What happened to,
"No man left behind, " okay?

753
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:04,288
Just wait, just wait! Listen!
Listen, okay?

754
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:07,207
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Let me just be real with you, all right?

755
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:10,586
I almost blinded Jamie Lee Curtis
on Freaky Friday, okay?

756
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:12,004
This shit will fucking ruin me!

757
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:14,006
- Just get off me! You're pathetic.
- No, I'm not.

758
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:16,592
- Get off me!
- You are not going back!

759
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:21,889
- What the fuck?
- Now wait a minute.

760
00:45:32,316 --> 00:45:34,985
So, what?
We're just supposed to keep walking?

761
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:37,905
Try to stay in character.
Remember, we're on camera.

762
00:45:37,988 --> 00:45:39,114
This thing's too heavy.

763
00:45:39,114 --> 00:45:40,616
I want the rubber one
that the prop guy gave me.

764
00:45:40,616 --> 00:45:42,910
Where's the fucking prop guy?

765
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:50,501
How's it going with that map, chief?

766
00:45:50,584 --> 00:45:53,212
- Can I have a look at it?
- I got it.

767
00:45:53,295 --> 00:45:54,922
Yeah, Damien gave it to me,
remember?

768
00:45:55,005 --> 00:45:56,507
Yeah, but he gave it to you for us.

769
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,217
- Yeah.
- Okay.

770
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,802
- I got it.
- You got it upside down.

771
00:46:01,011 --> 00:46:02,012
Thank you.

772
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:03,722
Letters go one way
and the numbers another.

773
00:46:03,805 --> 00:46:05,307
Dude, I'm trying to...
I got your back, man.

774
00:46:05,516 --> 00:46:07,184
- Well, I'm cool. All right, I'm cool.
- You are?

775
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:09,186
Is your character dyslexic?

776
00:46:09,311 --> 00:46:11,021
- No, my character's not dyslexic.
- So you a cartographer.

777
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:12,898
I'm tired, I want to go home.

778
00:46:13,023 --> 00:46:15,609
Why, so you can get back and make
Fatties: Fart 20, or some shit?

779
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:18,612
It's Fatties: Fart Two, there's no... Hey,
you wish you had a Fatties franchise.

780
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:19,905
- What?
- It's Fatties: Fart Two.

781
00:46:19,988 --> 00:46:21,323
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't want no Fatties franchise,

782
00:46:21,406 --> 00:46:23,784
- I got a diamond toilet.
- Your stupid-ass commercials.

783
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:25,410
You're all fucked up, man,
you look tired.

784
00:46:25,494 --> 00:46:26,620
You look like you bumped your head
or something,

785
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:28,497
so I came over to see
if you're fucking all right, that's all.

786
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:30,707
- Yeah, why don't you get on point?
- I'm on point right here.

787
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:31,792
... my farts
are fucking more beautiful than...

788
00:46:31,917 --> 00:46:34,503
You still got that shit upside down.

789
00:46:35,003 --> 00:46:36,505
The numbers help, man, the numbers...

790
00:46:36,505 --> 00:46:38,799
The letters go across the top
and then the numbers.

791
00:46:38,924 --> 00:46:40,509
- Want the map?
- Yeah, I want the fucking map.

792
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:42,010
Well, you can't have it,
'cause Damien gave it me.

793
00:46:42,094 --> 00:46:45,305
You wish you had my farts,
my farts are fucking music.

794
00:46:45,305 --> 00:46:47,724
All right. That's enough.

795
00:46:49,184 --> 00:46:53,021
Everybody's obviously a little bushed
from all this humping.

796
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:56,108
So take a chow break. Chow break!

797
00:46:57,818 --> 00:46:59,403
But stay alert.

798
00:46:59,987 --> 00:47:03,490
Remember, Charlie don't care
if you're on break or not.

799
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:11,498
All right, that's lunch. Coming back
to the same scene afterwards,

800
00:47:11,623 --> 00:47:12,916
"Lost in the goddamn jungle. "

801
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,084
Captain Simple Jack.

802
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:15,794
Fuck you.

803
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:26,513
I fucking hate movies.

804
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:31,685
This is bullshit.
I don't wanna be in this shitty movie.

805
00:47:41,487 --> 00:47:44,323
No! That's my jellybeans! No!

806
00:47:44,406 --> 00:47:49,119
Kid, grab the bat! Please! Shit!

807
00:47:49,203 --> 00:47:52,414
- Yo, man, I got a Bust-A-Nut.
- You go to hell! There he is.

808
00:47:55,918 --> 00:47:58,795
God damn it! Okay. Where'd he go?

809
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:02,090
You little piece of shit!
I'm gonna fucking rip your wings off!

810
00:48:04,092 --> 00:48:07,304
Sanducci. Hold up, man,
keep it on the down-low.

811
00:48:08,597 --> 00:48:10,807
I don't really gotta piss.
I'm trying to talk at you, man.

812
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:12,601
Bait, I need bait.

813
00:48:13,685 --> 00:48:17,397
You went to boot camp, right?
You can read a map?

814
00:48:17,606 --> 00:48:18,816
Yeah, I think so.

815
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:21,610
I know Speedman
got everyone convinced we out here

816
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:25,489
making Planet of the Apes on YouTube
or some shit, but I don't buy it.

817
00:48:25,614 --> 00:48:28,116
You wanna step on a real landmine?
You wanna die?

818
00:48:28,826 --> 00:48:30,494
You wanna get shot
by a real motherfucker?

819
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:33,789
- Keep looking ahead, man.
- No, of course not.

820
00:48:34,206 --> 00:48:36,416
Trying to get home, man.

821
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:38,210
Got a big job coming up next year.

822
00:48:38,293 --> 00:48:39,711
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

823
00:48:39,795 --> 00:48:42,297
It's about Abe Lincoln and John Wilkes
Booth when they were both young.

824
00:48:42,506 --> 00:48:43,507
- Oh, wow!
- Yeah.

825
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,093
- That's a classy picture.
- Dude, you kind of look like Abe.

826
00:48:46,218 --> 00:48:47,719
Slap a beard on you.

827
00:48:47,803 --> 00:48:49,805
- What's your fucking name?
- Really? It's Kevin.

828
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:52,015
- Kevin Sandusky.
- Yeah.

829
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:56,186
If I can put that map in your hands,
can I count on you?

830
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,107
- Well, yeah, I guess you can.
- Dynamite. I'm out.

831
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:06,196
That smelled just like bologna
for some reason.

832
00:49:06,321 --> 00:49:08,907
Is anyone gonna fucking help me
get this fucking thing?

833
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:12,119
Why are they even out in the daytime?

834
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:18,792
I'm gonna level with you, bro.
I don't need to pee. I need to talk to you.

835
00:49:25,007 --> 00:49:28,802
Lazarus is gonna torpedo the movie.

836
00:49:31,013 --> 00:49:32,723
He's way out on a limb
with this character,

837
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:34,725
and I think he's getting cold feet.

838
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:38,687
And the men respect you,
'cause you went to boot camp

839
00:49:38,812 --> 00:49:40,522
and rehearsal.

840
00:49:41,523 --> 00:49:44,109
- Can I count on you, Kyle.
- It's Kevin.

841
00:49:44,193 --> 00:49:45,194
Good.

842
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:49,615
If you want
I could give the map a look-see.

843
00:49:49,698 --> 00:49:51,909
- I'll handle the map.
- Okay.

844
00:49:51,992 --> 00:49:55,204
You stick with the program,
we get this movie in the can,

845
00:49:55,412 --> 00:49:59,124
I'm thinking there could be
a Teen Choice Award in it for you.

846
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:03,420
You have that potential.
They'll slime you, the whole deal.

847
00:50:03,504 --> 00:50:07,090
- Yeah, that's wicked.
- Good.

848
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:15,098
There it is! Yeah, now you're dead!

849
00:50:16,308 --> 00:50:17,518
You O. D. 'd!

850
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:20,395
Hold up now, Jeff.

851
00:50:22,815 --> 00:50:24,191
Fucking hell!

852
00:50:25,818 --> 00:50:28,904
What the hell, Jeff? That's a bat, man!

853
00:50:29,112 --> 00:50:31,490
I don't have any more jellybeans.

854
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:39,915
You land there!

855
00:50:54,805 --> 00:50:57,307
Wow. Look at these ruins.

856
00:50:59,393 --> 00:51:03,814
- Where the hell are we?
- D'ang Kwook River.

857
00:51:03,897 --> 00:51:06,316
That so? How do you know that?
How you sure?

858
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,610
Only one way to find out, dude. Let's go.

859
00:51:08,694 --> 00:51:13,824
Yeah. I'm not feeling so good right now.
Seriously, my skin hurts!

860
00:51:13,907 --> 00:51:16,326
Enough from the peanut gallery!
Into the water, ladies!

861
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:18,620
No, man. Let me take a look at that map
right quick.

862
00:51:18,704 --> 00:51:20,289
Why is everybody
all obsessed with the map?

863
00:51:20,414 --> 00:51:22,416
'Cause we're tired
of being your trail donkeys!

864
00:51:22,499 --> 00:51:24,918
Acting like you some one-man GPS!

865
00:51:25,002 --> 00:51:28,922
God damn it! We lost!
We fucking super lost, man!

866
00:51:29,006 --> 00:51:31,091
Tell him, McClusky.
Tell him what time it is.

867
00:51:31,216 --> 00:51:32,801
I don't believe you people.

868
00:51:34,511 --> 00:51:36,305
What do you mean "you people"?

869
00:51:38,807 --> 00:51:41,518
What do you mean, "you people"?

870
00:51:41,602 --> 00:51:43,604
I think what Tugg means is...

871
00:51:43,687 --> 00:51:45,105
No, look at his eyes, man.

872
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:47,900
... you people, you actors. You people...
- Look at them beady, white devil eyes.

873
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:49,610
I gotta get back to the hotel, for real!

874
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:51,612
- Hell, no!
- Silence!

875
00:51:52,613 --> 00:51:55,324
Chill! All right? Just chill it.

876
00:51:56,825 --> 00:51:59,995
Now, let's go get those Viet Congs.

877
00:52:00,787 --> 00:52:02,414
- "Viet Cong"!
- What?

878
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:05,918
It's "Viet Cong. " There's no "S. "
It's already plural.

879
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:07,711
You wouldn't say "Chineses. "

880
00:52:09,004 --> 00:52:11,507
All right, that's enough
of this insubordination!

881
00:52:11,507 --> 00:52:14,426
If the machine breaks down,
we break down.

882
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:17,012
Hey, man, you know how in Rambo I,
he was big but a little puffy

883
00:52:17,095 --> 00:52:18,722
and then Rambo II,
he got all shredded up?

884
00:52:18,805 --> 00:52:21,725
- Yeah.
- That's kind of how you look right now.

885
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:23,310
- Yeah?
- Not Rambo I but II.

886
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:25,187
- Really?
- Yeah, when he was cut up.

887
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:27,606
I'm not that... I mean,
that's what I'm going for, but you know...

888
00:52:27,689 --> 00:52:30,400
Come on, dude. You more shredded
than a julienne salad, man.

889
00:52:30,526 --> 00:52:32,110
- Thanks.
- What's the secret, dude?

890
00:52:32,194 --> 00:52:33,487
- It's a diet. I'm just dieting.
- Really?

891
00:52:33,612 --> 00:52:36,615
'Cause I'm trying to come up a little,
but it's just... lt's tough.

892
00:52:36,698 --> 00:52:38,200
- You look good.
- Any tips?

893
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:39,993
- What?
- Any tips, you got?

894
00:52:40,118 --> 00:52:41,203
There's, like, the pineapple...

895
00:52:41,411 --> 00:52:43,705
- Give me that goddamn map! Fuck you!
- Hey!

896
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:45,415
- Hey!
- All right, now!

897
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:47,918
What it is, Sikorski?
Tell us where we really at.

898
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:50,003
That's fucking bullshit!
It's a chump move.

899
00:52:50,128 --> 00:52:52,005
We just getting a second opinion, doc.

900
00:52:53,924 --> 00:52:55,092
We're going the wrong way!

901
00:52:55,217 --> 00:52:56,301
- Damn!
- Son of a bitch.

902
00:52:56,426 --> 00:53:00,889
God! I think we were
supposed to be doing this,

903
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:03,892
and instead we did this.

904
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:07,604
Shit, shit, shit, shitty shit, shit!

905
00:53:07,688 --> 00:53:10,315
Think you can get us back
to that drop zone, boy?

906
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:12,609
This is not cool!

907
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,405
Maybe.

908
00:53:17,906 --> 00:53:19,408
This is insane!

909
00:53:20,617 --> 00:53:22,995
Are you really going
to abandon this movie?

910
00:53:23,787 --> 00:53:25,998
We're supposed to be a unit!

911
00:53:26,123 --> 00:53:27,624
Suck my unit!

912
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:30,294
All right, fine.

913
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:35,299
- I'll finish it by myself.
- You go be all you can be, man.

914
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:37,426
Tugg, you have no idea
where you're going!

915
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:39,303
Yes, I do!

916
00:53:39,428 --> 00:53:44,016
I'm going to, "Exterior, rain forest, dusk.

917
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:48,520
"Smash cut to Four Leaf, who treks
alone through a frightening jungle. "

918
00:53:48,604 --> 00:53:50,606
Suck on that unit, Kirk!

919
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:07,206
Come on, men. Let's get home.

920
00:54:45,327 --> 00:54:49,998
Hello, Mr. Mantis. You're beautiful.

921
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:54,211
Now, if you recall that whole hullabaloo

922
00:54:54,294 --> 00:54:56,004
where Hollywood
was split into schisms,

923
00:54:56,213 --> 00:54:59,508
some studios backing Blu-ray Disc,
others backing HD DVD.

924
00:54:59,716 --> 00:55:00,717
People thought it would come down to

925
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:03,095
pixel rate or refresh rate,
and they're pretty much the same.

926
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:07,015
What it came down to was
a combination of gamers and porn.

927
00:55:07,099 --> 00:55:08,809
Now, whichever format porno backs

928
00:55:09,017 --> 00:55:12,813
is usually the one
that becomes the most successful.

929
00:55:12,813 --> 00:55:15,899
But, you know, Sony,
every PlayStation 3 has a Blu-ray in it.

930
00:55:16,024 --> 00:55:17,693
You talking to me this whole time?

931
00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:19,695
I was talking to whoever
was listening to me.

932
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,405
Jesus Christ, man!

933
00:55:39,715 --> 00:55:41,800
Booty Sweat.

934
00:55:47,806 --> 00:55:49,308
Oh, God!

935
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:56,106
It's cold! It's freezing. I'm fucking cold.

936
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:58,317
You want my flak jacket?

937
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,321
What, are you insane? It's boiling!
It's like a sweat lodge out here!

938
00:56:02,404 --> 00:56:05,324
Keep the volume down on that bitching,
Flatch Adams.

939
00:56:05,407 --> 00:56:07,326
I gotta take a fucking 12-pound shit!

940
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:09,328
- How we doing? We making good time?
- We're making good time,

941
00:56:09,411 --> 00:56:12,623
but there's no way we make it
over that ridge before sundown.

942
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:15,209
All right, fellas,
we're gonna make camp, rest up!

943
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:17,628
- Oh, God.
- Y'all might be in for a treat.

944
00:56:17,711 --> 00:56:19,129
You know,
back before the war broked out,

945
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:21,924
I was a saucier in San Antone.

946
00:56:22,007 --> 00:56:24,593
I bet I could collar up
some of them greens.

947
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:29,014
Yeah, noodle some crawfish
out the paddy, yo.

948
00:56:29,097 --> 00:56:33,227
And maybe some crab apples
for dessert, now, you hear? Hell, yeah!

949
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,813
Hell, yeah!

950
00:56:35,896 --> 00:56:40,108
That's how we all talk.
We all talk like this, suh! Yes, suh.

951
00:56:40,192 --> 00:56:45,405
Yeah, get some crawfish and some ribs.

952
00:56:45,614 --> 00:56:50,410
You're Australian! Be Australian!
Excuse me, Kangaroo Jack.

953
00:56:54,623 --> 00:56:57,125
I get excited about my foods, man.

954
00:58:22,711 --> 00:58:25,130
Die!

955
00:58:39,019 --> 00:58:41,104
No!

956
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:51,990
Dude, dude, what the hell
is going on here? Where are we?

957
00:58:52,115 --> 00:58:54,493
I have no idea.

958
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:57,120
I've never been outside the States.

959
00:58:57,204 --> 00:58:59,414
Wait, what?
Are you fucking kidding me?

960
00:58:59,498 --> 00:59:01,500
Did you make this
whole goddamn thing up?

961
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:03,001
Dude, were you
even in the fucking service?

962
00:59:03,126 --> 00:59:05,796
Yes. Of course. Coast Guard.

963
00:59:05,921 --> 00:59:07,798
- Coast Guard.
- Sanitation Department.

964
00:59:07,923 --> 00:59:10,592
Oh, my God!
You're a fucking garbage man!

965
00:59:10,717 --> 00:59:14,429
Damn it. F. L. Tayback lies to me
and the whole goddamn U. S. Of A.

966
00:59:14,513 --> 00:59:17,224
I wrote the book as a tribute!
I'm a patriot!

967
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:19,309
Yeah, you're the Milli Vanilli
of patriots, okay?

968
00:59:19,393 --> 00:59:21,103
You lied
about fighting the Vietnam War.

969
00:59:21,228 --> 00:59:24,523
It's like punching the American flag
in the face, God damn it.

970
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:26,108
God, and to think I believed in you!

971
00:59:26,108 --> 00:59:28,527
- I don't wanna be next to you.
- Writers lie all the time.

972
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:30,821
Can I be tied to another post? Okay.

973
00:59:52,301 --> 00:59:54,219
- Rick?
- Tugg.

974
00:59:54,303 --> 00:59:56,430
I killed one, Rick.

975
00:59:57,514 --> 00:59:59,892
The thing I love most in the world.

976
01:00:00,017 --> 01:00:01,810
Vivica, get off the line now!

977
01:00:04,104 --> 01:00:06,607
A hooker. All right, you killed a hooker.

978
01:00:06,607 --> 01:00:08,692
Calm down.
Here's what you're gonna do.

979
01:00:08,817 --> 01:00:10,027
Get your hands on some bleach,

980
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:12,529
some hydrogen peroxide
and a shitload of lime.

981
01:00:12,613 --> 01:00:14,114
No, a panda.

982
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:15,908
I killed a panda.

983
01:00:15,991 --> 01:00:17,910
Amanda? Come on, dude.

984
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:19,995
I mean,
that's probably not even her real name.

985
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,705
No, a panda!

986
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:23,207
A panda?

987
01:00:23,332 --> 01:00:25,918
A sweet, cuddly,

988
01:00:26,001 --> 01:00:27,920
vicious little panda.

989
01:00:28,003 --> 01:00:31,006
Jesus Christ, Tugg!
Man, don't scare me like that!

990
01:00:31,131 --> 01:00:32,299
It's beautiful here.

991
01:00:32,424 --> 01:00:33,926
You on the set?

992
01:00:34,009 --> 01:00:35,219
I am the set.

993
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:38,305
All right, man.
Hey, how's the TiVo working out?

994
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:39,723
Screw TiVo.

995
01:00:39,806 --> 01:00:42,226
I'm way beyond TiVo.

996
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:44,394
Last I checked,
they hadn't hooked it up, though.

997
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,815
Hadn't hooked it up? No TiVo?

998
01:00:47,898 --> 01:00:49,817
It doesn't matter anymore.

999
01:00:52,611 --> 01:00:54,112
I've moved on.

1000
01:00:54,822 --> 01:00:56,615
Where have you moved on to?

1001
01:00:56,615 --> 01:00:58,116
Another agency?

1002
01:00:59,618 --> 01:01:01,203
Who's with you?

1003
01:01:01,328 --> 01:01:03,497
It's Nick Stevens, isn't it?
That little fucker.

1004
01:01:03,622 --> 01:01:07,709
You are still my client, Tugg Speedman!
I am getting the TiVo!

1005
01:01:07,793 --> 01:01:10,003
Jacket's on, I'm out the door!

1006
01:01:10,128 --> 01:01:11,213
Tugg?

1007
01:01:14,424 --> 01:01:15,717
Please don't fire me.

1008
01:01:16,593 --> 01:01:17,803
I did it, I did it!

1009
01:01:17,928 --> 01:01:20,305
Vivica, what do I have scheduled
this afternoon?

1010
01:01:20,305 --> 01:01:23,308
- Two and a Half Men taping.
- Shit.

1011
01:01:24,226 --> 01:01:25,310
Cancel it.

1012
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:27,020
And get me Tugg's Tropic Thunder
contract.

1013
01:01:27,104 --> 01:01:30,315
I'm going to Grossman's office,
I'm playing the card.

1014
01:01:30,315 --> 01:01:31,400
Okay.

1015
01:01:34,903 --> 01:01:37,823
Oh, mama. Thirsty.

1016
01:01:37,906 --> 01:01:40,117
He doesn't look too good.

1017
01:01:40,117 --> 01:01:45,205
Must drink,
so I can throw something up!

1018
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:47,416
No, no. Don't drink that water!
That water's like a petri dish!

1019
01:01:47,499 --> 01:01:48,625
No, don't!

1020
01:01:48,709 --> 01:01:51,211
Alpa, do you have any Booty Sweat?

1021
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:53,714
Yeah, get him chugging on
some of Alpa's ass water.

1022
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:55,716
That'll bring him around. It's a cure-all.

1023
01:01:55,924 --> 01:01:57,718
Man, what you coming out
in movies for anyway?

1024
01:01:57,926 --> 01:01:59,511
Did you need another revenue stream?

1025
01:01:59,595 --> 01:02:02,431
For your information,
my revenue stream

1026
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:04,808
currently generates $2 million a year

1027
01:02:04,933 --> 01:02:06,894
in charitable contributions
for my community.

1028
01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:09,313
- Hot damn.
- And why am I in this movie?

1029
01:02:09,396 --> 01:02:11,815
Maybe I just knew I had to represent,

1030
01:02:11,899 --> 01:02:13,692
because they had one good part
in it for a black man

1031
01:02:13,817 --> 01:02:15,819
and they gave it to Crocodile Dundee.

1032
01:02:17,404 --> 01:02:21,033
Pump your brakes, kid.
That man is a national treasure.

1033
01:02:21,116 --> 01:02:23,327
I just wanted to throw another shrimp
on your barbie.

1034
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:24,411
That shit ain't funny.

1035
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:27,331
Hey, fellas! It's hot!
We're tired! It stinks!

1036
01:02:27,414 --> 01:02:28,916
I'm just fucking with you,
Kangaroo Jack!

1037
01:02:29,124 --> 01:02:30,792
I'm sorry a dingo ate your baby.

1038
01:02:30,918 --> 01:02:33,420
You know that's a true story?
Lady lost her kid.

1039
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:36,131
- You about to cross some fucking lines.
- Guys, relax and stuff.

1040
01:02:36,215 --> 01:02:37,299
You know what? Fuck that, man!

1041
01:02:37,424 --> 01:02:40,093
I'm sick of this koala-hugging nigger
telling me...

1042
01:02:44,806 --> 01:02:46,433
For 400 years,

1043
01:02:47,392 --> 01:02:50,312
that word has kept us down.

1044
01:02:51,313 --> 01:02:53,023
What the fuck?

1045
01:02:53,106 --> 01:02:56,902
It took a whole lot of trying
just to get up that hill.

1046
01:02:57,027 --> 01:02:59,905
Now we up in the big leagues,

1047
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:01,698
getting our turn at bat.

1048
01:03:01,824 --> 01:03:04,493
Long as we live, it's you and me, baby.

1049
01:03:05,118 --> 01:03:08,497
That's the theme song for
The Jeffersons. You really need help.

1050
01:03:08,622 --> 01:03:11,708
Yeah. Just 'cause it's the theme song,
don't make it not true.

1051
01:03:11,834 --> 01:03:13,794
You know what?
I'm gonna tell you what's true.

1052
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:17,297
I'm gonna tag you back.
You better believe that, baby.

1053
01:03:17,506 --> 01:03:20,008
Guys! Hey, guys!

1054
01:03:20,634 --> 01:03:23,095
Jeff, stay away from that animal.

1055
01:03:25,514 --> 01:03:28,308
I'm gonna bite his hide. I need...

1056
01:03:29,309 --> 01:03:32,604
I need to wear his stomach skin
like a unitard.

1057
01:03:33,522 --> 01:03:36,817
Ain't nobody doing nothing
to no one or body!

1058
01:03:37,025 --> 01:03:41,905
Now, if Mr. Portnoy is feeling
a little flu-ish, don't wanna walk,

1059
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:44,032
put him up on that cloven-hoof animal!

1060
01:03:45,409 --> 01:03:46,702
We got ground to cover!

1061
01:04:15,731 --> 01:04:19,026
All right, POW camp, scene 67.

1062
01:04:19,818 --> 01:04:21,612
Bring it on, Cockburn!

1063
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:32,122
Maybe he's not, you know,
Ridley Scott or something,

1064
01:04:32,206 --> 01:04:33,999
but I think Renny Harlin's
a tremendous filmmaker

1065
01:04:34,124 --> 01:04:36,919
like, Adventures of Ford Fairlane,
you know,

1066
01:04:37,002 --> 01:04:40,714
as far as an Andrew Dice Clay
vehicle goes, it's pretty decent.

1067
01:04:40,714 --> 01:04:43,217
And Cliffhanger.
Cliffhanger's incredible.

1068
01:04:43,217 --> 01:04:46,720
As far as the whole like,
man against nature type of movies go,

1069
01:04:46,929 --> 01:04:49,014
it's absolutely amazing.

1070
01:04:49,097 --> 01:04:51,016
Shut the fuck up!

1071
01:04:55,604 --> 01:04:57,314
Who send you here?

1072
01:04:57,397 --> 01:05:02,110
Tayback, John, Sergeant,
United States Army.

1073
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:08,200
Serial number 694529987.

1074
01:05:11,912 --> 01:05:14,998
Perhaps some hot tea
will make conversing

1075
01:05:15,123 --> 01:05:16,917
a little easier.

1076
01:05:20,629 --> 01:05:22,798
My leader's not quite as cordial.

1077
01:05:26,218 --> 01:05:29,096
Look, what? I just thought you might
like some hot tea

1078
01:05:29,221 --> 01:05:32,724
- in order to calm your nerves.
- Tayback, John, Sergeant,

1079
01:05:32,808 --> 01:05:37,813
United States Army, 694529987.

1080
01:05:38,605 --> 01:05:44,194
And here's a little message
from my Uncle Sam.

1081
01:05:49,825 --> 01:05:52,202
Dude, you all right?

1082
01:05:52,327 --> 01:05:53,704
Man you totally leaned into that.

1083
01:05:53,829 --> 01:05:56,915
I was pulling it back
and you just came in too...

1084
01:05:56,999 --> 01:05:59,209
Hey, it was an accident, man.

1085
01:06:01,712 --> 01:06:03,714
Come on, good.
You want to keep going?

1086
01:06:03,797 --> 01:06:05,424
- Let's go.
- Get up.

1087
01:06:05,507 --> 01:06:07,134
I rather rot in your V. C. Jail!

1088
01:06:07,217 --> 01:06:11,096
I'll never bend to your will!
You scum! You scum!

1089
01:06:11,221 --> 01:06:13,223
Now say this
and go to the beginning again,

1090
01:06:13,307 --> 01:06:15,100
let's do the tea part, okay?

1091
01:06:16,602 --> 01:06:18,020
Dude, I hope you're not pissed.

1092
01:06:18,312 --> 01:06:20,230
I see moss on both sides of that tree.

1093
01:06:20,314 --> 01:06:23,400
Well, you know, maybe if I wasn't
the only one at boot camp...

1094
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:25,402
My belly really hurts, you guys!

1095
01:06:25,527 --> 01:06:27,696
I'm not joking around, I'm nauseous.

1096
01:06:27,821 --> 01:06:30,032
Let me off, I gotta puke!
I don't wanna die like Hendrix!

1097
01:06:30,115 --> 01:06:31,909
All right. All right.

1098
01:06:36,413 --> 01:06:38,415
Are you okay, Jeff?

1099
01:06:38,499 --> 01:06:39,917
I'm awesome.

1100
01:06:42,211 --> 01:06:43,712
Holy shit!

1101
01:06:48,217 --> 01:06:50,511
Okay. Everyone, down, down, down.

1102
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:56,600
Man. Now I'm tripping.

1103
01:06:56,725 --> 01:06:59,436
That looks like the POW camp
from out the script, yo.

1104
01:07:00,229 --> 01:07:02,022
Speedman was right?

1105
01:07:02,105 --> 01:07:03,398
I don't think so.

1106
01:07:03,524 --> 01:07:05,734
Look at the cooking vats,
the armed guards.

1107
01:07:07,319 --> 01:07:09,530
Looks like a heroin processing plant.

1108
01:07:10,614 --> 01:07:11,698
We were in that chopper for hours.

1109
01:07:11,824 --> 01:07:14,117
I don't even think
we're in Vietnam anymore.

1110
01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:16,620
- Fuck.
- Shit. We ain't even in 'Nam?

1111
01:07:16,703 --> 01:07:19,498
No, most likely Myanmar or Laos.

1112
01:07:19,623 --> 01:07:21,124
What the fuck is Laos?

1113
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:22,417
It's the Golden Triangle.

1114
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:24,419
Oh, fuck. We're dead.

1115
01:07:24,628 --> 01:07:26,505
No one gets out of here. I saw it on TV.

1116
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:30,717
Fucking boats, airplanes,
UFOs and shit, they all just vanish!

1117
01:07:30,717 --> 01:07:33,303
Yo, that's the Bermuda Triangle,
dumbass.

1118
01:07:33,428 --> 01:07:35,806
This is the Golden Triangle.

1119
01:07:35,931 --> 01:07:37,432
It's the world's hard drug superhighway.

1120
01:07:37,516 --> 01:07:38,809
How do you know that?

1121
01:07:38,934 --> 01:07:41,728
It was a really long trip.
I read the in-flight magazine.

1122
01:07:43,397 --> 01:07:44,815
Cut!

1123
01:07:44,898 --> 01:07:46,316
Oh, Jesus!

1124
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,902
What do you see, man? I'm blocked.

1125
01:07:49,111 --> 01:07:50,404
Damien, cut!

1126
01:07:52,114 --> 01:07:53,824
Hey, Damien, cut!

1127
01:07:54,616 --> 01:07:56,326
They got Speedman.

1128
01:07:56,827 --> 01:07:58,328
And it doesn't look good.

1129
01:08:31,028 --> 01:08:32,321
I am Tran.

1130
01:08:33,197 --> 01:08:35,407
You are a trespasser in my poppy fields.

1131
01:08:36,825 --> 01:08:39,536
You are D. E. A. Scum!

1132
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:44,833
Were there some re-writes
that I missed?

1133
01:08:51,131 --> 01:08:52,716
Do you want to die?

1134
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:54,801
- Do you?
- No!

1135
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:59,097
Please, don't hurt me!

1136
01:09:07,022 --> 01:09:08,232
Say that again.

1137
01:09:09,233 --> 01:09:11,026
Please, don't hurt me.

1138
01:09:11,109 --> 01:09:14,196
No! Like you did before! Say it!

1139
01:09:15,113 --> 01:09:16,114
Say it!

1140
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:20,202
Please, don't hurt me!

1141
01:09:35,926 --> 01:09:38,512
- What?
- You are Simple Jack.

1142
01:09:41,431 --> 01:09:43,308
You saw Simple Jack?

1143
01:09:43,433 --> 01:09:45,727
We love the tale of this man,
Simple Jack.

1144
01:09:47,437 --> 01:09:49,314
We do not have many luxury here.

1145
01:09:49,398 --> 01:09:51,817
And Simple Jack is the only movie
we possess.

1146
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:55,737
You got the VHS.

1147
01:09:55,904 --> 01:09:57,906
We've watched it many, many times.

1148
01:09:58,031 --> 01:10:00,534
You should've got Oscar.

1149
01:10:03,537 --> 01:10:05,330
Well, you know. It's...

1150
01:10:06,623 --> 01:10:07,833
Just to be nominated...

1151
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:09,209
You were nominated?

1152
01:10:09,209 --> 01:10:10,836
No, no, no. I wasn't nominated.

1153
01:10:10,919 --> 01:10:14,131
I'm just saying that to have been
nominated would have been nice.

1154
01:10:14,214 --> 01:10:16,508
It's just... lt's very political.
You have to take out ads...

1155
01:10:16,633 --> 01:10:19,136
- Shut up now!
- Okay. Okay.

1156
01:10:19,928 --> 01:10:21,722
So, are you going to

1157
01:10:23,307 --> 01:10:25,017
let me go, or...

1158
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:27,227
No. We'll hold you for ransom.

1159
01:10:27,311 --> 01:10:29,104
Much more money now!

1160
01:10:40,616 --> 01:10:41,700
He's in a meeting.

1161
01:10:41,825 --> 01:10:44,620
Yeah, I know.
In about two seconds with the Pecker.

1162
01:10:45,621 --> 01:10:47,414
I'm gonna rip your fucking tits off.

1163
01:10:47,623 --> 01:10:50,209
You wanna talk about trouble?
That's trouble.

1164
01:10:50,334 --> 01:10:51,919
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1165
01:10:53,837 --> 01:10:55,714
What do you need, Peck?

1166
01:10:55,797 --> 01:10:58,509
No, more like what do you need, Les?

1167
01:10:58,634 --> 01:10:59,801
Glasses?

1168
01:11:00,802 --> 01:11:01,929
What?

1169
01:11:02,012 --> 01:11:04,515
So you can read
the Tropic Thunder contract

1170
01:11:04,598 --> 01:11:07,017
that guarantees my client,
Tugg Speedman,

1171
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:10,813
some form of digital video recorder
on location.

1172
01:11:11,605 --> 01:11:13,816
- Huh?
- I can't believe you let him in.

1173
01:11:15,317 --> 01:11:18,237
Look, fuckstick, I'm incredibly busy,
so why don't you get the hell out of here

1174
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,406
before I snap your dick off
and jam it into your ass?

1175
01:11:21,532 --> 01:11:23,534
No, not you, Helen.

1176
01:11:23,617 --> 01:11:27,329
But I will rip your tits off
if you don't get me those theaters.

1177
01:11:27,412 --> 01:11:28,914
Perfect.

1178
01:11:28,997 --> 01:11:31,500
Hey, Tuggernuts,
I've got you on speakerphone.

1179
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:33,418
I'm standing here with Les Grossman,

1180
01:11:33,502 --> 01:11:36,713
and he is dying to tell you
why he's apparently wiped his ass

1181
01:11:36,839 --> 01:11:39,216
with the TiVo clause from your contract.

1182
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:42,302
We are Flaming Dragon.

1183
01:11:42,511 --> 01:11:44,805
Speedman is with us now.

1184
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:48,517
For 50 million, you will get him back.

1185
01:11:48,517 --> 01:11:50,727
- Are you gonna get those...
- Who is this?

1186
01:11:50,811 --> 01:11:53,522
- And how did you get this phone?
- We are Flaming Dragon!

1187
01:11:53,605 --> 01:11:55,524
Simple Jack belong to us now.

1188
01:11:58,235 --> 01:12:00,320
He does, does he?

1189
01:12:00,404 --> 01:12:02,906
Let me tell you something, shitbird.

1190
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:05,409
I've never even heard
of your little agency.

1191
01:12:05,534 --> 01:12:07,536
But if you think
you can poach my client...

1192
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:12,124
Send $50 million, or you no see
Simple Jack again because we kill him.

1193
01:12:12,207 --> 01:12:13,709
This is Les Grossman. Who is this?

1194
01:12:13,834 --> 01:12:16,128
This is Flaming Dragon!

1195
01:12:16,211 --> 01:12:19,006
Okay. Flaming Dragon. Fuckface.

1196
01:12:19,131 --> 01:12:23,927
First, take a big step back
and literally fuck your own face!

1197
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:28,015
Now, I don't know what kind of
pan-Pacific bullshit power play

1198
01:12:28,223 --> 01:12:30,601
you're trying to pull here,
but Asia, Jack, is my territory.

1199
01:12:30,726 --> 01:12:32,019
So whatever you're thinking,
you better think again.

1200
01:12:32,102 --> 01:12:33,520
Otherwise, I'm gonna
have to head down there,

1201
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,899
and I will rain down an ungodly
fucking firestorm upon you.

1202
01:12:37,107 --> 01:12:38,734
You're gonna have to call
the fucking United Nations

1203
01:12:38,817 --> 01:12:42,821
and get a fucking binding resolution
to keep me from fucking destroying you.

1204
01:12:42,905 --> 01:12:45,532
I am talking scorched earth,
motherfucker!

1205
01:12:45,616 --> 01:12:47,409
I will massacre you!

1206
01:12:47,534 --> 01:12:49,411
I will fuck you up!

1207
01:12:57,211 --> 01:12:58,921
- Could you find out who that was? Go.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1208
01:13:34,414 --> 01:13:37,417
You wear these.
More like Simple Jack teeth.

1209
01:13:37,501 --> 01:13:39,211
Okay.

1210
01:13:39,336 --> 01:13:42,005
Hey. Look, I know you're a big fan,
and that's great...

1211
01:13:45,133 --> 01:13:46,718
Put teeth in!

1212
01:13:53,809 --> 01:13:55,727
Now do movie.

1213
01:13:55,811 --> 01:13:57,521
The whole movie?

1214
01:13:57,604 --> 01:13:59,231
I can't. I don't know the whole...

1215
01:13:59,314 --> 01:14:01,817
You perferm! You perferm or die!

1216
01:14:02,526 --> 01:14:04,111
Monkey swine!

1217
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:08,407
Pa.

1218
01:14:10,325 --> 01:14:11,702
More stupid!

1219
01:14:13,537 --> 01:14:18,500
Pa, why you gotta make me feel bad?

1220
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:22,337
You saw what I saw.

1221
01:14:22,421 --> 01:14:25,007
Tugg Speedman is dead meat
if we don't do something soon.

1222
01:14:25,132 --> 01:14:27,509
Yeah. We could do something
by getting our asses back to the hotel,

1223
01:14:27,634 --> 01:14:28,927
which is in the other direction!

1224
01:14:29,011 --> 01:14:30,637
Ain't right.

1225
01:14:30,721 --> 01:14:32,806
What would've happened
in The Great Escape

1226
01:14:32,806 --> 01:14:36,727
if Steve McQueen and them dudes
had turned tail and ran?

1227
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:40,814
Well, that's what that movie was about.
They were escaping. They ran away.

1228
01:14:40,939 --> 01:14:43,525
I'm trying to agree with you.
The point is they did something.

1229
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:44,818
Then what are we supposed to do, huh?

1230
01:14:45,027 --> 01:14:48,906
'Cause he's cleaning a gun
with no bullets. Yeah, that's a plan.

1231
01:14:49,031 --> 01:14:53,118
I'm just like a little boy,
playing with his dick when he's nervous.

1232
01:14:56,205 --> 01:14:58,832
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1233
01:14:58,916 --> 01:15:01,919
I got an idea.
This might be a little crazy.

1234
01:15:02,002 --> 01:15:04,004
Crazy's better than nothing.

1235
01:15:04,213 --> 01:15:08,133
Back in '98, I did a low-budget
titty comedy for Skinemax.

1236
01:15:08,217 --> 01:15:11,512
- Sex Camp. Remember it?
- Yeah.

1237
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:15,599
Anyway, me and the campers
from the uncool camp

1238
01:15:15,724 --> 01:15:18,227
had to break into the rich girl camp.

1239
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:20,020
So, what we did,

1240
01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:23,106
we built a catapult
out of logs and underwear,

1241
01:15:23,232 --> 01:15:26,819
and they shot us over the wall,
and we parachuted down.

1242
01:15:32,407 --> 01:15:33,826
Look,

1243
01:15:33,909 --> 01:15:35,911
you guys, we already know the plan.

1244
01:15:36,119 --> 01:15:38,038
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm giving you gold.

1245
01:15:38,121 --> 01:15:42,501
We do it just like in the book,
Chapter 26, the Wet Offensive.

1246
01:15:42,626 --> 01:15:45,003
The book of Tropic Thunder.

1247
01:15:45,128 --> 01:15:47,422
Yeah, did you guys read the book?

1248
01:15:48,632 --> 01:15:51,218
The flap, I read the back flap
and saw the pictures.

1249
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:55,222
Well, it's okay.
It's exactly the same as in the script.

1250
01:15:55,305 --> 01:15:56,431
Cool.

1251
01:15:58,308 --> 01:16:00,936
You guys all read the script, right?

1252
01:16:01,019 --> 01:16:03,105
I don't read the script, script reads me.

1253
01:16:04,314 --> 01:16:05,732
What the hell does that even mean?

1254
01:16:05,816 --> 01:16:09,236
What you getting at with the books,
scripts? Spit that shit out, man!

1255
01:16:12,531 --> 01:16:14,408
All right. The Wet Offensive.

1256
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:18,328
Osiris and Fats go undercover
as a diversion.

1257
01:16:18,412 --> 01:16:20,706
Motown and Brooklyn sneak in
via the river.

1258
01:16:20,831 --> 01:16:23,333
Yeah. But those dudes
was trained soldiers.

1259
01:16:25,127 --> 01:16:26,211
Yeah!

1260
01:16:27,212 --> 01:16:30,215
And we trained actors, motherfucker.

1261
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:34,720
Time to man up.
And I ain't gonna sugarcoat.

1262
01:16:34,803 --> 01:16:37,514
Some of us
might not even make it back.

1263
01:16:37,639 --> 01:16:40,809
What do you mean?
Like not on the same flight?

1264
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,231
Alpa and I's already wearing
earth mama's natural night camo.

1265
01:16:46,315 --> 01:16:48,108
- Cool it, Benson.
- Sorry.

1266
01:16:49,234 --> 01:16:53,822
We gonna scout, get a plan together.
We ain't back in 20, come looking.

1267
01:16:55,324 --> 01:16:57,117
We are Flaming Dragon.

1268
01:17:00,829 --> 01:17:02,122
Okay.

1269
01:17:03,332 --> 01:17:06,502
Flaming Dragon's
a heroin manufacturer.

1270
01:17:06,627 --> 01:17:09,713
They're responsible
for an eighth of the drug trade in Asia.

1271
01:17:09,838 --> 01:17:13,008
- Huge profit margin.
- Guys!

1272
01:17:13,133 --> 01:17:16,011
Would somebody please let me know
what the game plan is?

1273
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:17,930
Peck! We have it handled.

1274
01:17:18,013 --> 01:17:20,516
Please, don't interrupt.
Everything's under control.

1275
01:17:20,641 --> 01:17:22,601
I got it. Got it.

1276
01:17:34,738 --> 01:17:37,032
- Les Grossman.
- We not get money yet.

1277
01:17:37,533 --> 01:17:39,618
Price now 100 million!

1278
01:17:39,701 --> 01:17:42,538
You pay now,
or tomorrow Simple Jack die.

1279
01:17:42,621 --> 01:17:45,707
Great. Let me get this down.

1280
01:17:45,833 --> 01:17:47,334
100 million.

1281
01:17:47,417 --> 01:17:49,920
Wait! I got a better idea.

1282
01:17:50,629 --> 01:17:52,506
Instead of 100 million,

1283
01:17:52,506 --> 01:17:55,509
how about I send you
a hobo's dick cheese?

1284
01:17:55,509 --> 01:17:57,928
Then you kill him! Do your thing!
Skin the fucking bastard!

1285
01:17:58,011 --> 01:18:00,139
Go to town, man! Go to town!

1286
01:18:00,222 --> 01:18:02,432
- No...
- In the meantime, and as usual,

1287
01:18:02,516 --> 01:18:04,226
go fuck yourself!

1288
01:18:05,227 --> 01:18:07,938
- No.
- We don't negotiate with terrorists.

1289
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:12,734
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, are you insane?

1290
01:18:12,818 --> 01:18:14,611
- I think I could've done that better.
- I thought it was good.

1291
01:18:14,736 --> 01:18:16,613
They're gonna kill him!

1292
01:18:19,616 --> 01:18:20,701
And?

1293
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,204
"And?"

1294
01:18:25,622 --> 01:18:29,626
It's a cold, hard world. Shit happens.

1295
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,132
We'll weep for him, in the press.

1296
01:18:35,215 --> 01:18:37,926
Set up a scholarship in his name.

1297
01:18:38,010 --> 01:18:41,930
Eventually, and I'm talking way,
way down the road,

1298
01:18:42,014 --> 01:18:43,640
we file an insurance claim.

1299
01:18:43,724 --> 01:18:46,435
Preferably before
the end of the fiscal year.

1300
01:18:46,518 --> 01:18:50,314
Actually, the claim alone would net us
more than the movie would lose.

1301
01:18:52,441 --> 01:18:54,234
You can't be serious.

1302
01:18:55,402 --> 01:18:56,904
You kick in the door to my house,

1303
01:18:57,112 --> 01:19:02,534
all ants in your pants,
sucking my left nut to get a TiVo scrap

1304
01:19:02,618 --> 01:19:07,331
for the third runner-up
Sexiest Man Alive 1998,

1305
01:19:07,414 --> 01:19:09,708
and you're asking if I'm serious?

1306
01:19:13,629 --> 01:19:15,339
Let's face it.

1307
01:19:15,422 --> 01:19:19,510
The kids aren't dressing up as Scorcher
for Purim anymore.

1308
01:19:20,803 --> 01:19:23,806
Speedman is a dying star,

1309
01:19:23,931 --> 01:19:27,142
a white dwarf heading for a black hole.

1310
01:19:27,309 --> 01:19:30,020
That's physics. It's inevitable.

1311
01:19:30,103 --> 01:19:33,524
We've been handed
an incredible opportunity here, Peck.

1312
01:19:33,607 --> 01:19:37,402
The universe is talking to us right now.

1313
01:19:37,528 --> 01:19:39,112
You just gotta listen.

1314
01:19:52,209 --> 01:19:55,712
See, this is the good part, Pecker.
This is when the job gets fun.

1315
01:19:55,838 --> 01:19:57,005
Yeah.

1316
01:19:57,130 --> 01:20:00,217
Ask and you shall receive.

1317
01:20:01,218 --> 01:20:05,430
- All right.
- You play ball, we play ball.

1318
01:20:05,514 --> 01:20:08,809
I know you want the goodies.

1319
01:20:09,017 --> 01:20:11,019
Welcome to the goody room.

1320
01:20:11,103 --> 01:20:15,732
You paying attention?
'Cause I'm talking G5 for the Pecker.

1321
01:20:15,816 --> 01:20:17,109
That's how you're gonna roll.

1322
01:20:17,234 --> 01:20:21,238
No more frequent flier
bitch miles for my boy.

1323
01:20:21,321 --> 01:20:22,531
Yeah!

1324
01:20:23,031 --> 01:20:24,408
Playa.

1325
01:20:25,242 --> 01:20:26,535
Playa!

1326
01:20:27,536 --> 01:20:28,912
Big dick playa.

1327
01:20:29,037 --> 01:20:30,914
Swinging past your knees!

1328
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:32,124
Big dick, baby.

1329
01:20:32,207 --> 01:20:33,417
Yep.

1330
01:20:36,712 --> 01:20:39,423
Or you can grow a conscience

1331
01:20:39,506 --> 01:20:41,842
in the next five minutes
and see where that takes you.

1332
01:20:46,722 --> 01:20:48,932
Let me get this straight.

1333
01:20:49,016 --> 01:20:52,603
You want me
to let my client of 15 years,

1334
01:20:52,728 --> 01:20:54,021
one of my best friends,

1335
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:58,817
die in the jungle, alone,
for some money and a G5?

1336
01:20:59,943 --> 01:21:01,111
Yes.

1337
01:21:06,116 --> 01:21:08,410
A G5 airplane?

1338
01:21:10,537 --> 01:21:11,622
Yes.

1339
01:21:12,706 --> 01:21:15,417
And lots of money.

1340
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:18,921
Playa.

1341
01:21:21,715 --> 01:21:23,008
Yeah!

1342
01:21:24,218 --> 01:21:26,929
Smack it up, flip it, rub it down!

1343
01:21:29,431 --> 01:21:32,142
But Mama take care of Jack a lot.

1344
01:21:32,935 --> 01:21:36,730
How many more sleeps
before she wakes up again?

1345
01:21:36,814 --> 01:21:38,315
Sorry, Jack.

1346
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:40,734
She in heaven now.

1347
01:21:41,443 --> 01:21:44,738
Damn! I thought the movie was bad.

1348
01:21:44,822 --> 01:21:47,908
She sleep forever.

1349
01:21:48,116 --> 01:21:51,203
To the man's credit, he's actually
eased up on the retard throttle.

1350
01:21:51,328 --> 01:21:54,915
And now that's added a balance,
and the audience can connect.

1351
01:21:54,915 --> 01:21:58,836
I mean, this is Theater 101,
but, you know, he's had a tough road.

1352
01:21:58,919 --> 01:22:00,003
He'll become a naturalist.

1353
01:22:00,128 --> 01:22:01,839
- Yeah.
- Break down the aesthetic distance,

1354
01:22:01,922 --> 01:22:03,632
then the...

1355
01:22:06,343 --> 01:22:08,011
Told you I'd tag you back.

1356
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:12,933
Can I tell you that I'm sorry

1357
01:22:13,016 --> 01:22:15,310
for any offense I might've caused, man?

1358
01:22:15,435 --> 01:22:17,813
- I just got caught up in...
- In being a dumbass?

1359
01:22:17,938 --> 01:22:19,314
I guess so.

1360
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:22,109
Why you still doing this
Chicken George shit, I have no idea.

1361
01:22:22,109 --> 01:22:23,527
- Neither do I.
- It's beyond me.

1362
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:25,821
- It's beyond me.
- You confused.

1363
01:22:25,904 --> 01:22:27,823
- I am a little confused.
- I know.

1364
01:22:29,408 --> 01:22:31,243
But are we cool?

1365
01:22:31,326 --> 01:22:32,619
Not really.

1366
01:22:36,415 --> 01:22:38,125
Hey, man.

1367
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,835
- How's it going?
- Good. Yourself?

1368
01:22:39,918 --> 01:22:42,004
Hey, so, if it's no big deal,

1369
01:22:42,129 --> 01:22:45,007
I think I'm just gonna hang back here
for the mission.

1370
01:22:45,132 --> 01:22:46,717
Watch the stuff.

1371
01:22:46,842 --> 01:22:48,844
- Is that cool?
- What? No!

1372
01:22:49,011 --> 01:22:50,804
We need you, Jeff.

1373
01:22:51,013 --> 01:22:52,514
What are you talking about?

1374
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:54,224
Okay, look, man.

1375
01:22:55,434 --> 01:22:57,811
- I got something to tell you.
- Okay.

1376
01:23:00,022 --> 01:23:02,733
You know those jellybeans
I was eating?

1377
01:23:02,816 --> 01:23:05,944
Well, they werent jellybeans, okay?

1378
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:09,615
- They were drugs.
- Really?

1379
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:14,119
I get down there near the mother lode,
I am done. I'm jonesing bad, man.

1380
01:23:14,244 --> 01:23:17,122
I'm gonna fucking do all the heroin
in the fucking world.

1381
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:24,630
If you guys wanna make it through
this thing, you gotta strap me to a tree.

1382
01:23:26,006 --> 01:23:29,718
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious. Literally, a tree.

1383
01:23:29,843 --> 01:23:32,721
And you can, no matter what, you can't
fucking untie me until it is done,

1384
01:23:32,805 --> 01:23:34,431
until it is out of my system.

1385
01:23:34,515 --> 01:23:36,141
I'm gonna say,
"Hey, man, I'm cool. It's cool.

1386
01:23:36,225 --> 01:23:37,810
"I'm finally better. I'm finally better.
Untie me. "

1387
01:23:37,935 --> 01:23:41,104
Don't listen to me!
Anything I fucking say is a lie!

1388
01:23:41,230 --> 01:23:42,523
You got it!

1389
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:45,317
Goodbye, Mama!

1390
01:23:45,317 --> 01:23:48,529
Now you can have ice cream in heaven.

1391
01:23:48,612 --> 01:23:53,617
I'll see you tonight, when I go to bed,
in my head movies.

1392
01:23:54,535 --> 01:23:59,122
But this head movie
makes my eyes rain.

1393
01:24:08,132 --> 01:24:11,426
Dang.
Short-bus is taking some real hits.

1394
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:16,140
- They got him on the move!
- That's torture, man.

1395
01:24:16,223 --> 01:24:19,143
Okay. That's where they keeping him.

1396
01:24:19,226 --> 01:24:21,436
I gotta get cracking on my costume.

1397
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:22,938
Say, are you good
with a needle and thread?

1398
01:24:23,021 --> 01:24:24,022
Hell, yeah.

1399
01:24:24,106 --> 01:24:27,526
Alpa Chino chinos sold more than
five million pairs last spring at the Gap.

1400
01:24:27,609 --> 01:24:30,320
- I sewed them patterns myself, baby.
- Let's roll out.

1401
01:25:02,227 --> 01:25:04,521
It's a little twig man Oscar.

1402
01:25:11,111 --> 01:25:13,530
I'm going to call you Half Squat.

1403
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,242
And you can call me

1404
01:25:18,243 --> 01:25:19,536
Papa.

1405
01:25:43,018 --> 01:25:44,812
Wow, look at all those stars.

1406
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:48,732
Really makes a guy feel pretty small.

1407
01:25:50,234 --> 01:25:52,820
This could be the last time
we look at these stars.

1408
01:25:53,737 --> 01:25:55,239
Man, that's beauty.

1409
01:25:57,115 --> 01:26:00,244
Nights like tonight
make a man wonder what it's all about.

1410
01:26:00,327 --> 01:26:02,621
Hey, you guys.
Anybody got some bug spray?

1411
01:26:04,414 --> 01:26:05,624
Don't ignore me!

1412
01:26:05,707 --> 01:26:08,627
Stick it out, man.
We're gonna get through this.

1413
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:11,839
- Hey, Kirk?
- Yeah?

1414
01:26:11,922 --> 01:26:14,716
Are you still dating
Jennifer Love Hewitt?

1415
01:26:14,842 --> 01:26:16,218
'Cause I think she's hot.

1416
01:26:16,343 --> 01:26:19,721
No, that was just some
tabloid conjecture.

1417
01:26:19,847 --> 01:26:23,809
Hey, guys, I'm good. I made it through.
You can untie me now.

1418
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:26,228
Funny, huh?

1419
01:26:26,311 --> 01:26:29,231
The circus life 280 days a year
on location.

1420
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:33,318
It's hard to find a girl
that can hang with that, you know?

1421
01:26:35,112 --> 01:26:37,239
Not one worth keeping, nohow.

1422
01:26:37,322 --> 01:26:39,616
Hey, Radar? Evans?

1423
01:26:39,741 --> 01:26:40,826
No, it's Kevin.

1424
01:26:40,909 --> 01:26:42,619
Kev, whatever the fuck.
Come over here.

1425
01:26:42,744 --> 01:26:44,913
I didn't tell you, but Fatties: Fart Three
is coming down the pike,

1426
01:26:45,038 --> 01:26:48,625
and there's a role in there for you
if you come over and untie me.

1427
01:26:48,709 --> 01:26:51,211
Jeff, you're just going to
have to tough it out.

1428
01:26:51,336 --> 01:26:53,338
Your mother's a cankerous whore!

1429
01:26:53,422 --> 01:26:54,715
Jesus, man.

1430
01:26:55,716 --> 01:26:57,217
Hey, man.

1431
01:26:57,342 --> 01:27:00,220
Remember way back when I said
your mother was a cankerous whore?

1432
01:27:00,345 --> 01:27:03,807
I'm sorry, man.
I did not mean that. She's not.

1433
01:27:03,807 --> 01:27:05,517
How about you, man?

1434
01:27:05,642 --> 01:27:08,145
You got some little minx waiting for you
on the other side of tomorrow?

1435
01:27:08,228 --> 01:27:09,730
Me?

1436
01:27:09,813 --> 01:27:12,608
I've barely even had a girlfriend, and...

1437
01:27:13,317 --> 01:27:17,112
I was really hoping I'd get laid
when this movie came out,

1438
01:27:17,112 --> 01:27:19,615
but that's not gonna happen.

1439
01:27:20,407 --> 01:27:21,909
What about you, Masterblaster?

1440
01:27:22,034 --> 01:27:24,620
You got a certain someone you trying
to get with back in the States?

1441
01:27:24,745 --> 01:27:29,416
What, Alpa Chino?
He's like 10 girls deep, 24/7.

1442
01:27:29,541 --> 01:27:30,834
No. You missing me, man.

1443
01:27:30,918 --> 01:27:32,711
I'm talking about something special.
Big difference.

1444
01:27:32,836 --> 01:27:34,046
How about it?

1445
01:27:34,713 --> 01:27:35,923
Yeah.

1446
01:27:37,341 --> 01:27:39,343
Yeah, there is.

1447
01:27:39,426 --> 01:27:42,721
Well? What's the skinny?
Y'all been on a date or what?

1448
01:27:42,846 --> 01:27:44,723
No. I mean...

1449
01:27:44,807 --> 01:27:49,645
I always wanted to, but I guess
I just never had the courage to ask.

1450
01:27:49,728 --> 01:27:51,522
It's... lt's complicated.

1451
01:27:51,522 --> 01:27:54,024
No! It's simple as pie, man.

1452
01:27:54,107 --> 01:27:56,735
You plant your feet in the ground, you
look her square in the eyes, you say,

1453
01:27:56,819 --> 01:28:00,447
"Hey, baby, you and me's going
on a date. " That's the end of story.

1454
01:28:00,531 --> 01:28:03,242
- What's her name?
- Lance.

1455
01:28:03,325 --> 01:28:05,118
"Listen here, Lance... "

1456
01:28:05,911 --> 01:28:09,832
Lance? What the fuck did I just hear?
Lance?

1457
01:28:09,915 --> 01:28:11,625
- Did you say "Lance"?
- No!

1458
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:13,710
- That sounded like "Lance. "
- No, I said "Nance. "

1459
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:15,921
- That's what I said, "Nance. "
- It sounded like "Lance. "

1460
01:28:16,046 --> 01:28:17,548
Look, I'm Alpa Chino, okay?

1461
01:28:17,631 --> 01:28:19,341
I love the pussy! All right?

1462
01:28:19,424 --> 01:28:21,343
Lay your ass back down
and look at the stars.

1463
01:28:21,426 --> 01:28:22,845
When you wrote I Love Tha Pussy

1464
01:28:22,928 --> 01:28:26,306
was you thinking of dangling your dice
on Lance's forehead?

1465
01:28:26,306 --> 01:28:28,725
Oh, hell, no! What? Come on. Look.

1466
01:28:28,809 --> 01:28:31,812
- Man, everyone's gay once in a while.
- I'm not gay!

1467
01:28:31,812 --> 01:28:32,938
This Hollywood.

1468
01:28:33,021 --> 01:28:34,022
How about we all get back to work?

1469
01:28:34,148 --> 01:28:35,816
- Okay. Cool.
- This is ridiculous!

1470
01:28:35,941 --> 01:28:38,819
We got a big day tomorrow.
Let's get focused.

1471
01:28:41,321 --> 01:28:46,243
Alpa, if you untie me,
I will literally suck your dick right now.

1472
01:28:46,326 --> 01:28:49,621
I told you, for the last time,
I love the pussy!

1473
01:28:50,914 --> 01:28:53,834
I'll cradle the balls, stroke the shaft,

1474
01:28:53,917 --> 01:28:57,045
work the pipe and swallow the gravy.

1475
01:28:57,129 --> 01:28:59,214
Get it over here, buddy. Let's do this.

1476
01:29:05,721 --> 01:29:06,847
Okay, so, what's the plan?

1477
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:08,307
Are you gonna talk Vietnamese
to those dudes?

1478
01:29:08,432 --> 01:29:10,225
No. No. Mandarin Chinese.

1479
01:29:10,309 --> 01:29:12,019
Which, from what I can tell,
is what they speaking down there.

1480
01:29:12,019 --> 01:29:13,645
How the hell do you know Chinese?

1481
01:29:13,729 --> 01:29:17,232
Land of Silk and Money with Gong Li.
Second Globe, third Oscar.

1482
01:29:17,316 --> 01:29:21,320
Prepped for that one by working in
a Beijing textile factory for eight months.

1483
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:23,322
That might be our ride.

1484
01:29:40,047 --> 01:29:41,340
The straps are too tight!

1485
01:29:41,423 --> 01:29:43,717
Shut your mouth and follow my lead.

1486
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:14,623
The straps are cutting off
my circulation!

1487
01:30:14,748 --> 01:30:15,833
Fuck you!

1488
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:26,135
Not the fucking bull again.
Fucking asshole.

1489
01:31:20,147 --> 01:31:22,816
Laz, don't let him take me off the yak.

1490
01:31:27,321 --> 01:31:29,615
Bitch whore! Fucking hate you!

1491
01:31:39,708 --> 01:31:40,834
Okay.

1492
01:31:43,212 --> 01:31:44,713
All right.

1493
01:31:44,838 --> 01:31:47,216
That looks like it could be
the munitions hut right there.

1494
01:31:47,341 --> 01:31:49,426
I'm gonna try to find Speedman
in the main building.

1495
01:32:07,319 --> 01:32:11,031
I don't know Chinese but it sounds like
your improvising is for shit.

1496
01:32:11,114 --> 01:32:12,241
Oh, fuck!

1497
01:32:27,714 --> 01:32:29,424
Get over here!

1498
01:32:30,717 --> 01:32:32,344
- What are you guys doing here?
- He has hands.

1499
01:32:32,427 --> 01:32:34,847
- He killed Damien.
- Bullshit!

1500
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:37,432
- He blinded Jamie Lee Curtis.
- Almost!

1501
01:32:37,516 --> 01:32:40,727
What are you talking about?
Damien stepped on a old landmine.

1502
01:32:40,811 --> 01:32:42,437
Sweet. Thank God.

1503
01:32:42,521 --> 01:32:44,731
- We busting Speedman out.
- Speedman's here?

1504
01:33:12,843 --> 01:33:15,512
I take it y'all are doing
the Wet Offensive from the book.

1505
01:33:15,512 --> 01:33:16,847
I can give y'all a diversion.

1506
01:33:16,930 --> 01:33:20,809
I got enough shit here to light this place
up like it's the Fourth of fucking July.

1507
01:34:02,309 --> 01:34:04,812
Yes, your farm.

1508
01:34:09,149 --> 01:34:11,610
Where is your farm,

1509
01:34:13,111 --> 01:34:14,613
American?

1510
01:34:17,449 --> 01:34:18,742
My farm?

1511
01:34:20,619 --> 01:34:21,912
Oh, shit.

1512
01:34:22,621 --> 01:34:25,916
Here's my motherfucking farm!

1513
01:34:25,916 --> 01:34:27,543
Yeah!

1514
01:34:32,422 --> 01:34:35,425
Yeah! Chicka-chickaw, baby!

1515
01:34:36,426 --> 01:34:37,636
Kwan-Lo!

1516
01:34:39,138 --> 01:34:41,014
I'm a lead farmer, motherfucker!

1517
01:34:41,515 --> 01:34:42,724
Yeah!

1518
01:34:44,226 --> 01:34:47,521
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
keep your head down!

1519
01:34:47,521 --> 01:34:49,815
Keep your head down on the ground!

1520
01:34:49,940 --> 01:34:52,151
Nobody move or I do the little big guy!

1521
01:34:52,234 --> 01:34:55,612
That's right,
we running this program now, J. P.

1522
01:34:55,737 --> 01:34:58,448
Now show me where the drugs are.

1523
01:34:58,532 --> 01:35:00,325
What the fuck?

1524
01:35:00,450 --> 01:35:02,119
That ain't the plan!

1525
01:35:02,119 --> 01:35:03,912
Dont judge me!

1526
01:35:07,541 --> 01:35:09,334
He's got a real serious problem.

1527
01:35:10,127 --> 01:35:12,421
Hey! Hey, you!

1528
01:35:12,546 --> 01:35:16,550
Take off your clothes!

1529
01:35:16,550 --> 01:35:17,926
What do we do now?

1530
01:35:18,010 --> 01:35:19,845
Stick with the plan. Find Speedman.

1531
01:35:19,928 --> 01:35:22,347
Alpa, keep this clown posse down.
Come on now.

1532
01:35:22,431 --> 01:35:25,851
Y'all heard the man.
Be suede, don't move!

1533
01:35:25,851 --> 01:35:27,811
Fuck your do-rag. Fuck your do-rag.

1534
01:35:27,811 --> 01:35:30,439
- Door!
- One, two, three!

1535
01:35:43,619 --> 01:35:45,537
I go high, you go low.

1536
01:35:49,833 --> 01:35:53,712
Get down. Get down! Get down!
Chow Yun-Fat, get the hell down!

1537
01:35:53,837 --> 01:35:57,132
If I see one more head pop up,
it's gonna be bullet Whac-A-Mole.

1538
01:35:58,717 --> 01:36:00,135
Come on, come on!

1539
01:36:00,219 --> 01:36:02,221
- Smoke grenade.
- Don't drop it now.

1540
01:36:02,930 --> 01:36:04,515
Here.

1541
01:36:04,515 --> 01:36:07,017
- What's this?
- I don't know what it's called.

1542
01:36:07,017 --> 01:36:09,728
I just know the sound it makes
when it lies.

1543
01:36:09,812 --> 01:36:13,315
Don't move, Matchbox,
or I will shoot you.

1544
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:16,318
I'm gonna put on this thing. Don't move.

1545
01:36:16,443 --> 01:36:18,111
I can still see you.

1546
01:36:24,243 --> 01:36:25,410
Tugg!

1547
01:36:27,913 --> 01:36:29,122
Tugg?

1548
01:36:31,124 --> 01:36:32,334
Gotcha.

1549
01:36:33,544 --> 01:36:36,421
Roll your shit up, man. We going home.

1550
01:36:36,547 --> 01:36:37,714
Home?

1551
01:36:39,716 --> 01:36:43,637
But I'm doing five shows a day
for a standing-room-only crowd.

1552
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:46,348
Don't you get it? I already am home.

1553
01:36:48,517 --> 01:36:51,728
All right, now, dude, you gotta get it...

1554
01:36:51,812 --> 01:36:54,022
My son gave this to me.

1555
01:36:54,148 --> 01:36:57,651
- That's your stick buddy?
- His name is Twigman.

1556
01:36:57,734 --> 01:36:59,611
Does he wanna come with us?

1557
01:37:20,549 --> 01:37:22,718
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1558
01:37:22,843 --> 01:37:27,723
Maybe y'all heard of me.
Y'all heard of Alpa Chino? No?

1559
01:37:27,848 --> 01:37:30,350
I love that pussy, hell, yeah, hell, yeah

1560
01:37:30,434 --> 01:37:31,518
They're not your demo, dude.

1561
01:37:32,019 --> 01:37:34,438
Come on.
Six motherfucking VMAs, baby.

1562
01:37:34,521 --> 01:37:37,733
Two BET Awards. Alpa Chino.

1563
01:37:37,816 --> 01:37:44,239
Like him in Carlito's Way?

1564
01:37:44,615 --> 01:37:47,326
Hey, yo, you know what?
Speak English. I don't speak that stuff.

1565
01:37:47,451 --> 01:37:49,328
What're you sayin'? Huh?

1566
01:37:49,411 --> 01:37:54,041
Devil's Advocate. Dog Day Affernoon.

1567
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:57,252
Cruising. Sea of Love.

1568
01:37:57,336 --> 01:38:00,339
Real Al Pacino.

1569
01:38:00,422 --> 01:38:04,051
Get the fuck down. That's a whole
different dude altogether.

1570
01:38:04,134 --> 01:38:07,221
What you doing? What you doing?
Don't touch that gun.

1571
01:38:07,221 --> 01:38:08,722
Don't do it! Don't touch that gun!

1572
01:38:08,722 --> 01:38:11,141
On my momma, if you touch that gun...

1573
01:38:15,729 --> 01:38:18,148
- Oh, shit, it's on!
- Over here!

1574
01:38:52,516 --> 01:38:54,351
- What're you doing?
- I'm gonna give these boys

1575
01:38:54,434 --> 01:38:56,019
a Hanoi high-five.

1576
01:39:08,615 --> 01:39:10,033
Shadow me, Pinocchio!

1577
01:39:10,826 --> 01:39:12,035
Smoke!

1578
01:39:17,833 --> 01:39:19,626
Oh, shit!

1579
01:39:24,423 --> 01:39:26,049
Jeff, don't!

1580
01:39:26,717 --> 01:39:28,844
It doesn't matter what I do.

1581
01:39:28,927 --> 01:39:31,847
I'll always be a screw-up.
No one'll ever respect me.

1582
01:39:31,930 --> 01:39:36,018
That is not true, you are not a screw-up!
You make so many people laugh.

1583
01:39:36,018 --> 01:39:38,353
They only laugh at my farts.

1584
01:39:38,437 --> 01:39:40,439
Jeff, we really need to go now!

1585
01:39:40,522 --> 01:39:42,149
This is all I deserve!

1586
01:40:02,252 --> 01:40:04,546
Laugh at that, you bastards!

1587
01:40:04,630 --> 01:40:08,050
Hilarious! Hilarious!

1588
01:40:09,551 --> 01:40:12,429
Let's move. We only have 16 hours
before they wake up.

1589
01:40:28,654 --> 01:40:30,239
Sounds like the dinner bell's ringing.

1590
01:40:30,322 --> 01:40:33,325
These assholes are gonna be crawling
in here ready to fucking eat us.

1591
01:40:36,245 --> 01:40:39,122
There. All right, you keep six right here.

1592
01:40:41,041 --> 01:40:43,252
Come on, let's go.

1593
01:40:43,335 --> 01:40:45,254
Come on, what are you guys doing?
Let's get out of here!

1594
01:40:45,337 --> 01:40:47,047
He's on tilt status.

1595
01:40:47,131 --> 01:40:51,135
Same thing happened to me when
I played Neil Armstrong in Moonshot.

1596
01:40:51,218 --> 01:40:53,220
They found me in an alley in Burbank

1597
01:40:53,345 --> 01:40:56,640
trying to re-enter the Earth's
atmosphere in an old refrigerator box.

1598
01:40:57,349 --> 01:40:58,433
What're you talking about?

1599
01:40:58,517 --> 01:41:00,936
Come on, fellas, we really need to go.

1600
01:41:01,019 --> 01:41:05,440
Daggomit, Blamtucky,
I ain't re-programming a VCR.

1601
01:41:11,321 --> 01:41:13,615
Give me the flame thrower.
You gotta start the chopper.

1602
01:41:13,615 --> 01:41:17,119
- No, fuck that! Just give me this.
- No time! I'll take care of this!

1603
01:41:18,328 --> 01:41:20,247
All right. Give me your hooks.

1604
01:41:20,330 --> 01:41:21,915
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna put them on again.

1605
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:24,918
- Just give me your goddamn hooks.
- All right. Here.

1606
01:41:25,043 --> 01:41:27,254
Get those boys back to the bird, pronto!

1607
01:41:32,134 --> 01:41:34,344
Shit! Enough!

1608
01:41:34,428 --> 01:41:36,346
Fake shit!

1609
01:41:39,349 --> 01:41:40,517
Fuck!

1610
01:41:48,233 --> 01:41:51,445
Go get your guys!
Get them to the chopper!

1611
01:41:51,528 --> 01:41:53,614
I'll take care of these yahoos!

1612
01:41:55,616 --> 01:41:57,951
You're gonna focus up now,
motherfucker, and say it.

1613
01:41:58,035 --> 01:42:00,120
- "It's me, Tugg!"
- It's me, Tugg.

1614
01:42:00,245 --> 01:42:01,747
That's right! Now, Tugg who?

1615
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:04,625
- Tugg who? I don't know. Who are you?
- Me?

1616
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:06,418
I know who I am!

1617
01:42:06,543 --> 01:42:10,214
I'm a dude playing a dude
disguised as another dude.

1618
01:42:10,339 --> 01:42:11,423
What?

1619
01:42:11,548 --> 01:42:13,634
You a dude
that don't know what dude he is!

1620
01:42:13,717 --> 01:42:16,428
Or are you a dude who has no idea
what dude he is

1621
01:42:16,553 --> 01:42:17,846
and claims to know what dude he is...

1622
01:42:17,930 --> 01:42:19,723
What the fuck
are you guys talking about?

1623
01:42:19,848 --> 01:42:20,849
... by playing other dudes?

1624
01:42:20,933 --> 01:42:22,226
I know what dude I am!

1625
01:42:22,351 --> 01:42:25,020
- You're scared.
- I ain't scared. Scared of what?

1626
01:42:25,145 --> 01:42:26,438
Or scared of who?

1627
01:42:26,522 --> 01:42:29,149
- Scared of who?
- Come on, guys. We really need to go!

1628
01:42:29,233 --> 01:42:30,526
Scared of you.

1629
01:42:35,322 --> 01:42:37,741
- Jesus.
- What's going on?

1630
01:42:37,825 --> 01:42:39,451
The dudes are emerging.

1631
01:42:39,451 --> 01:42:40,828
He's right, you know.

1632
01:42:42,538 --> 01:42:44,039
I am not

1633
01:42:45,541 --> 01:42:47,251
Sergeant Lincoln Osiris.

1634
01:42:51,630 --> 01:42:53,132
We gotta roll out.

1635
01:42:53,215 --> 01:42:56,552
Nor am I Father O'Malley.

1636
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:01,640
Or Neil Armstrong.

1637
01:43:09,231 --> 01:43:11,441
I think I might be nobody.

1638
01:43:12,734 --> 01:43:13,944
Wow!

1639
01:43:14,027 --> 01:43:16,738
The insecurity level
with you guys is ridiculous!

1640
01:43:17,948 --> 01:43:20,951
- Everybody's got issues!
- Yeah, man, everybody got issues.

1641
01:43:21,034 --> 01:43:23,620
Come on! You're Kirk Lazarus.

1642
01:43:23,745 --> 01:43:25,914
You're the whole reason
I got into acting.

1643
01:43:26,039 --> 01:43:27,833
I memorized every single monologue

1644
01:43:27,916 --> 01:43:30,544
you ever did
when I was in theater school.

1645
01:43:30,627 --> 01:43:32,754
- Really?
- Yeah. And look, Tugg!

1646
01:43:32,754 --> 01:43:35,215
I saw Scorcher I
24 times when I was in eighth grade.

1647
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:38,218
That shit blew me away!
I got high to that shit! You the man!

1648
01:43:38,343 --> 01:43:41,555
Yeah, man, Scorcher I was great.
Let's get the fuck out of here!

1649
01:43:41,638 --> 01:43:45,851
Tugg, Tugger, you're the last piece
of the puzzle, buddy.

1650
01:43:45,851 --> 01:43:48,854
We need you! Your men need you!
Are you with us?

1651
01:43:53,150 --> 01:43:55,235
I'm a rooster illusion.

1652
01:43:55,319 --> 01:43:56,528
Fuck it. We'll deal with him later.

1653
01:43:56,653 --> 01:43:59,823
Let's move. Come on. Come on.
Double time. Gotta go!

1654
01:44:02,326 --> 01:44:04,119
Come on, come on, come on.

1655
01:44:07,831 --> 01:44:09,833
Bingo! Move out.

1656
01:44:11,752 --> 01:44:13,128
Oh, God.

1657
01:44:15,047 --> 01:44:18,050
Just say no to this,
you drug-making midget.

1658
01:44:22,554 --> 01:44:24,056
Gotta hold on!

1659
01:44:30,145 --> 01:44:31,522
Four Leaf!

1660
01:44:36,235 --> 01:44:37,653
You grew hands?

1661
01:44:46,829 --> 01:44:48,455
RPG, gentlemen!

1662
01:44:51,125 --> 01:44:52,751
Where are you going?

1663
01:44:58,215 --> 01:45:00,717
Oh, my God.
I am moving to catering after this.

1664
01:45:22,739 --> 01:45:28,620
My ass!

1665
01:45:30,247 --> 01:45:33,542
Hey, yo!
We gotta get our shit together, Tugg!

1666
01:45:33,625 --> 01:45:35,919
We gotta get his cracker ass
to the chopper!

1667
01:45:35,919 --> 01:45:40,257
Are you still crazy?
We gotta get Candisky to the chopper!

1668
01:45:40,340 --> 01:45:41,842
It's Sandusky.

1669
01:45:43,719 --> 01:45:47,055
- Kevin Sandusky.
- That's my name.

1670
01:45:47,139 --> 01:45:48,724
You remembered my name.

1671
01:45:48,849 --> 01:45:50,851
Alpa, go help Cody.

1672
01:45:50,934 --> 01:45:52,936
Portnoy, get Sandusky
back to the chopper. Go!

1673
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:54,938
- I got him!
- Let's go!

1674
01:45:56,356 --> 01:45:57,816
Let's get out of here!

1675
01:46:09,745 --> 01:46:11,246
Hey, Leaf!

1676
01:46:11,330 --> 01:46:12,623
- Leaf!
- Yeah.

1677
01:46:12,623 --> 01:46:13,749
Hit the plunger

1678
01:46:13,832 --> 01:46:15,042
- as soon as they clear the bridge!
- Got it!

1679
01:46:20,255 --> 01:46:22,633
Come on! Get in the chopper!

1680
01:46:22,841 --> 01:46:25,636
- Come on! Move!
- Kirk! Wait!

1681
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:31,850
Laz, I'm gonna blow the bridge!

1682
01:46:31,934 --> 01:46:33,727
Are you the special effects guy?

1683
01:46:33,852 --> 01:46:35,938
- You God damn right I am.
- Fuck yeah!

1684
01:46:36,355 --> 01:46:37,523
Leaf's about to blow the bridge.
Come on!

1685
01:46:37,648 --> 01:46:40,317
You don't have to! You don't have to!
I'm staying.

1686
01:46:40,317 --> 01:46:41,819
No, I can't let you do that, mate.
We gotta go.

1687
01:46:41,944 --> 01:46:44,530
No, I'm telling you, I'm not being crazy.
They'll listen to me.

1688
01:46:44,655 --> 01:46:47,157
I know it sounds weird,
but I have a connection with them.

1689
01:46:47,241 --> 01:46:50,035
You're not doing tofu dinner theater
for these motherfuckers. Let's roll!

1690
01:46:50,118 --> 01:46:53,956
- Get over here!
- I have a son now. Little Half Squat.

1691
01:46:54,039 --> 01:46:55,624
Who in crikey fuck is Half Squat?

1692
01:46:55,749 --> 01:46:57,918
He's my son. He's my boy!

1693
01:46:58,043 --> 01:47:00,420
He needs me. I have to go back to him.

1694
01:47:03,632 --> 01:47:05,342
You tell the world what happened here.

1695
01:47:05,425 --> 01:47:07,219
What happened here?

1696
01:47:07,344 --> 01:47:09,555
I don't know, but you need to tell them.

1697
01:47:11,932 --> 01:47:13,851
I got this.

1698
01:47:13,851 --> 01:47:15,018
Tugg!

1699
01:47:15,727 --> 01:47:19,356
You take care of the boys!
I'll deal with these guys.

1700
01:47:20,649 --> 01:47:24,319
Where is he going?
We're gonna fucking die!

1701
01:47:24,444 --> 01:47:27,030
Laz, come on. He joined the circus.
Let's go.

1702
01:47:27,156 --> 01:47:28,323
- You've got hands.
- Yeah.

1703
01:47:28,448 --> 01:47:30,617
- Fuck! You've got hands?
- Come on!

1704
01:47:31,618 --> 01:47:32,828
- Come on!
- Get in!

1705
01:47:32,953 --> 01:47:34,538
- Come on!
- He's staying?

1706
01:47:34,621 --> 01:47:36,957
Go! He's a lost cause, mate!
Get out of here!

1707
01:47:41,420 --> 01:47:46,049
I was wrong! Blow the bridge!
Blow the fucking bridge!

1708
01:47:51,722 --> 01:47:53,223
I got this.

1709
01:47:53,849 --> 01:47:55,350
Leaf, no!

1710
01:48:39,436 --> 01:48:42,022
It's over! He's gone!

1711
01:48:42,147 --> 01:48:44,233
Cody! We gotta go!

1712
01:48:46,235 --> 01:48:47,444
Look.

1713
01:49:10,050 --> 01:49:11,426
Think he's done.

1714
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:12,719
Cover me!

1715
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:16,723
- Come on!
- Wait, come back!

1716
01:49:16,849 --> 01:49:18,642
How do we cover him?

1717
01:49:22,855 --> 01:49:26,233
All right, game over. Come on, mate.
Come on.

1718
01:49:26,358 --> 01:49:28,944
- You all right, man?
- I'm cold.

1719
01:49:29,027 --> 01:49:31,029
I can't feel my legs.

1720
01:49:31,155 --> 01:49:34,158
No, no, they're in a puddle, mate. See?
There's a puddle right there.

1721
01:49:34,158 --> 01:49:35,450
- No worries.
- Good.

1722
01:49:35,450 --> 01:49:36,827
Come on, we gotta split, man.

1723
01:49:36,952 --> 01:49:39,121
- You guys came back for me.
- Course.

1724
01:49:39,246 --> 01:49:41,623
Hey! I want you to know something.

1725
01:49:41,748 --> 01:49:42,958
What?

1726
01:49:44,042 --> 01:49:45,919
I know who you are.

1727
01:49:47,921 --> 01:49:49,756
You're my friend.

1728
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:53,635
You're my brother.

1729
01:49:54,553 --> 01:49:57,347
But like a really cool brother, you know?

1730
01:49:57,431 --> 01:49:58,849
Like a brother
where there was no animosity or...

1731
01:49:58,932 --> 01:50:01,852
Don't look now,
you got some real tears going.

1732
01:50:01,852 --> 01:50:02,936
Really?

1733
01:50:03,020 --> 01:50:04,521
That's the stuff
that accolades are made of.

1734
01:50:04,521 --> 01:50:06,023
Jesus, let's go, man!

1735
01:50:06,148 --> 01:50:07,649
All right?

1736
01:50:09,151 --> 01:50:10,652
Upsy-daisy.

1737
01:50:12,321 --> 01:50:15,324
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

1738
01:50:17,534 --> 01:50:18,827
Get in! Get in!

1739
01:50:18,952 --> 01:50:20,954
Come on! Here we go!

1740
01:50:23,457 --> 01:50:26,335
Tuggernuts! I got it!

1741
01:50:28,629 --> 01:50:30,923
- Tugger!
- Rick!

1742
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:34,843
What the fuck?

1743
01:50:34,927 --> 01:50:36,553
I got the TiVo!

1744
01:50:37,429 --> 01:50:41,850
My friend wants a TiVo,
my friend gets a TiVo!

1745
01:50:47,022 --> 01:50:48,357
Oh, shit!

1746
01:51:25,018 --> 01:51:27,146
And the Oscar goes to...

1747
01:51:29,857 --> 01:51:32,234
Yes! Tugg Speedman.

1748
01:51:33,819 --> 01:51:36,530
"Tropic Blunder,
The True Story Behind the Making

1749
01:51:36,655 --> 01:51:39,158
"of the Most Expensive
Fake True War Story Ever. "

1750
01:51:40,742 --> 01:51:41,952
Yeah!

1751
01:51:46,540 --> 01:51:48,459
Yeah, you son of a bitch!

1752
01:52:07,853 --> 01:52:12,149
Eight Oscars, $400 million

1753
01:52:12,232 --> 01:52:15,527
and you saved
Tugg Speedman's career.

1754
01:52:15,652 --> 01:52:18,447
I couldn't have done it
without you, Slolom.

1755
01:52:20,449 --> 01:52:21,658
Really?

1756
01:52:21,742 --> 01:52:23,744
No, dickhead, of course I could.

1757
01:52:23,827 --> 01:52:26,455
- A nutless monkey could do your job.
- Well, I...

1758
01:52:26,538 --> 01:52:29,458
Now, go get drunk
and take credit at all the parties.

1759
01:52:29,541 --> 01:52:32,336
- I would never do that to...
- Joking.

1760
01:52:32,419 --> 01:52:33,754
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1761
01:52:33,837 --> 01:52:36,048
Very... Okay, there he is.

1762
01:52:36,131 --> 01:52:37,633
- There he is. Okay.
- Go have fun.

1763
01:52:37,758 --> 01:52:39,343
All right. We're having a...

1764
01:52:39,426 --> 01:52:41,845
Fuck, okay. Thank you, Les.
Thank you. You have a good night...

1765
01:52:41,929 --> 01:52:44,348
But seriously,
a nutless monkey could do your job.

1766
01:52:44,431 --> 01:52:46,141
Good. Thank you, sir.
