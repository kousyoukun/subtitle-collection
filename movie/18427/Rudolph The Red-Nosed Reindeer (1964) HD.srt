364
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:18,579
come closer

365
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:23,829
what do you desire well we're a coupleof misfits from Christmas down and now

366
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:26,050
we'd like to live here

367
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:30,730
no that would not be possible thisisland is for toys alone

368
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:34,450
how do you like that even among thisfits your misfits

369
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:40,030
unlike playthings a living creaturecannot hide himself on an island but

370
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:45,970
perhaps being missed it yourselves youmight help the toys here help them

00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,750
I'm sure he could find little boys andgirls who would be happy with them a toy

374
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:05,319
