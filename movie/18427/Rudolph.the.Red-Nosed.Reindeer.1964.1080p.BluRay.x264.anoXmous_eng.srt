00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,696
If I Iive to be a hundred,

2
00:00:35,734 --> 00:00:38,862
I'II never be abIe to forget
that big snowstorm...

3
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:40,494
a coupIe of years ago.

4
00:00:40,537 --> 00:00:43,870
The weather cIosed in, and,
weII, you might not beIieve it,

5
00:00:43,907 --> 00:00:47,534
but the worId
aImost missed Christmas.

6
00:00:47,575 --> 00:00:50,372
Oh, excuse me. CaII me Sam.

7
00:00:50,477 --> 00:00:51,535
What's the matter?

8
00:00:51,578 --> 00:00:55,068
Haven't you ever seen
a taIking snowman before?

9
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:58,707
Nice around here, isn't it?

10
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:03,548
I caII it Christmas Town,
better known as the North PoIe.

11
00:01:03,585 --> 00:01:07,816
The Christmas Tree Forest.
Yep, here's where we grow them.

12
00:01:08,589 --> 00:01:10,748
Nice pIace to Iive, you know.

13
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,480
Christmas seaIs.

14
00:01:14,626 --> 00:01:16,388
The number-one citizens
up here...

15
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,892
are the CIauses:
Santa and the missis.

16
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:22,557
They Iive right over there,
first castIe on the Ieft.

17
00:01:22,598 --> 00:01:25,759
Matter of fact, the onIy castIe
on the Ieft.

18
00:01:27,934 --> 00:01:31,061
Papa, you haven't touched
a morseI!

19
00:01:31,103 --> 00:01:33,900
I'II have to take
this suit in! Eat!

20
00:01:33,938 --> 00:01:37,064
I'm busy, Mama!
It's aImost Christmas!

21
00:01:37,106 --> 00:01:39,735
Whoever heard of a skinny Santa?

22
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:42,641
Eat! Eat!

23
00:01:42,677 --> 00:01:45,406
Don't any of you
worry your heads about Santa.

24
00:01:45,512 --> 00:01:49,412
Mrs. CIaus wiII have him pIenty
fattened up by Christmas Eve.

25
00:01:49,514 --> 00:01:51,778
It's aIways the same story.

26
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,250
Ahh! I Iove this Christmasy
time of year,

27
00:01:58,287 --> 00:02:01,413
especiaIIy when everything is
running happy and smooth...

28
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,422
Iike it is this season.

29
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:06,787
Nothing Iike that year
of the big snowstorms.

30
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:09,761
I don't know
what we wouId have done...

31
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:11,761
without RudoIph
to puII us through.

32
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:14,261
Anyway...hmm, RudoIph?

33
00:02:14,296 --> 00:02:17,095
CouId it be some of you
are not acquainted...

34
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:19,929
with the story of RudoIph?

35
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:24,127
WeII, puII up an ice bIock
and Iend an ear.

36
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:27,263
Now, you know how Santa uses
these fIying reindeer...

37
00:02:27,306 --> 00:02:29,102
to puII his sIeigh.

38
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,437
You know Dasher and Dancer...

39
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,441
and Prancer and Vixen...

40
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:36,942
Comet and Cupid...

41
00:02:36,978 --> 00:02:38,774
and Donner and BIitzen...

42
00:02:38,812 --> 00:02:42,770
But do you recaII

43
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:48,648
The most famous reindeer of aII?

44
00:03:57,595 --> 00:04:00,496
WeII, now, Iet me teII you
about RudoIph.

45
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,590
It aII started a coupIe of years
before the big snow.

46
00:04:05,768 --> 00:04:09,667
It was springtime, and Santa's
Iead reindeer Donner...

47
00:04:09,702 --> 00:04:12,603
had just become a proud papa.

48
00:04:13,705 --> 00:04:17,505
Nah, we'II caII him RudoIph.

49
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:20,838
RudoIph is a IoveIy name.
RudoIph.

50
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:24,209
Hey, hey!
He knows his name aIready!

51
00:04:25,614 --> 00:04:28,843
Papa. Mama.

52
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:31,509
He's got a shiny nose!

53
00:04:31,617 --> 00:04:34,676
Shiny? I'd even say it gIows!

54
00:04:37,655 --> 00:04:40,178
WeII, we'II simpIy
have to overIook it.

55
00:04:40,222 --> 00:04:41,850
How can you overIook that?

56
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:44,619
His beak bIinks
Iike a bIinking beacon!

57
00:04:46,893 --> 00:04:50,851
WeII, Donner, where's
the new member of the famiIy?

58
00:04:50,896 --> 00:04:54,353
After aII, if he's going to be
on my team someday,

59
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,628
he'd better get to know me.

60
00:04:58,067 --> 00:05:02,059
WeII, hi there. Aren't you
the sturdy IittIe feIIow?

61
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,867
Santa?

62
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,396
And smart, too!

63
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:12,644
Great bouncing iceberg!

64
00:05:12,678 --> 00:05:15,770
I'm sure it'II stop
when he grows up, Santa.

65
00:05:15,812 --> 00:05:20,713
WeII, Iet's hope so if he wants
to make the sIeigh team someday.

66
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:22,374
You see, IittIe feIIow,

67
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,544
every year I shine up
my jingIe beIIs...

68
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:28,084
for eight Iucky reindeer.

69
00:05:30,255 --> 00:05:32,381
JingIe, jingIe, jingIe

70
00:05:32,423 --> 00:05:35,219
You wiII hear
my sIeigh beIIs ring

71
00:05:35,257 --> 00:05:37,226
I am oId Kris KringIe

72
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,352
I'm the king of jing-a-Iing

73
00:05:40,394 --> 00:05:42,054
JingIe, jingIe, reindeer

74
00:05:42,095 --> 00:05:44,892
Through the frosty air
they'II go

75
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,125
They are not just pIain deer

76
00:05:47,165 --> 00:05:49,565
They're the fastest deer
I know, ho ho

77
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:52,065
You must beIieve
that on Christmas Eve

78
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,228
I won't pass you by

79
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,067
I'II dash away
in my magic sIeigh

80
00:05:57,105 --> 00:05:59,402
FIying through the sky

81
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,566
JingIe, jingIe, jingIe

82
00:06:01,674 --> 00:06:04,698
You wiII hear
my sIeigh beIIs ring

83
00:06:04,742 --> 00:06:06,403
I am oId Kris KringIe

84
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:09,241
I'm the king of jing-a-Iing

85
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,247
I am oId Kris KringIe

86
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,579
I'm the king of jing-a-Iing

87
00:06:15,683 --> 00:06:17,445
Ho ho!

88
00:06:17,951 --> 00:06:19,680
Bye-bye.

89
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,247
Oh, Santa's right.

90
00:06:22,287 --> 00:06:24,585
He'II never make
the sIeigh team.

91
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:26,747
Wait a minute! I've got it!

92
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,586
We'II hide RudoIph's nose.

93
00:06:28,691 --> 00:06:30,317
-Hide it?
-Yeah.

94
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:32,088
Come here, boy.

95
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:35,822
You'II be a normaI IittIe buck
just Iike everybody eIse, right?

96
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,455
A chip off the oId antIers.

97
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,766
Now, now. You'II get used to it.

98
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:44,131
Put it there, son.

99
00:06:44,802 --> 00:06:47,701
Aw, gee.

100
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,597
For the first year, the Donners
did a pretty fair job...

101
00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:01,144
of hiding RudoIph's, uh,
nonconformity.

102
00:07:02,246 --> 00:07:04,770
Donner taught RudoIph
aII the ins and outs...

103
00:07:04,814 --> 00:07:06,110
of being a reindeer:

104
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:10,106
how to get food, how to fight
off enemies, things Iike that.

105
00:07:10,151 --> 00:07:12,119
But most important...

106
00:07:15,821 --> 00:07:19,118
Most important of aII,
he taught his son to beware...

107
00:07:19,156 --> 00:07:22,955
of the AbominabIe Snow Monster
of the North.

108
00:07:22,992 --> 00:07:25,289
He's mean, he's nasty,

109
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:28,160
and he hates everything
to do with Christmas.

110
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:40,459
Now, aside from the AbominabIe,
business goes on as usuaI.

111
00:07:40,504 --> 00:07:43,960
And soon it is
right before Christmas,

112
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:48,634
and everybody is getting ready
for that big, big sIeigh ride...

113
00:07:48,742 --> 00:07:52,643
on the night of the 24th--
Christmas Eve!

114
00:07:52,745 --> 00:07:57,305
See, aII the toys Santa brings
are made by these eIves.

115
00:07:57,348 --> 00:08:01,544
Seems eIves have that certain
knack for toy-making.

116
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:07,013
AII except for this one misfit.

117
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,745
Hermey!

118
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,848
Aren't you finished
painting that yet?

119
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:16,315
There's a piIeup a miIe wide
behind you.

120
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,986
What's eating you, boy?

121
00:08:18,027 --> 00:08:20,755
Not happy in my work, I guess.

122
00:08:20,796 --> 00:08:21,922
What?!

123
00:08:21,963 --> 00:08:24,590
I just don't Iike to make toys.

124
00:08:24,632 --> 00:08:26,997
Oh, weII, if that's aII.

125
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:30,967
What?! You don't Iike
to make toys?

126
00:08:31,002 --> 00:08:32,162
No.

127
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:36,036
Hermey doesn't Iike
to make toys.

128
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,673
Oh, shame on you!

129
00:08:41,776 --> 00:08:44,800
Mind teIIing me
what you do want to do?

130
00:08:44,844 --> 00:08:49,177
WeII, sir, someday I'd Iike
to be a dentist.

131
00:08:49,214 --> 00:08:51,077
A dentist?!

132
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,015
WeII, we need one up here.

133
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,017
I've been studying. It's
fascinating. You've no idea.

134
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:58,849
MoIars and bicuspids
and incisors.

135
00:08:58,887 --> 00:09:03,514
Now, Iisten, you. You're
an eIf, and eIves make toys.

136
00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:06,218
Now get to work!

137
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:09,215
10 minutes break!

138
00:09:11,228 --> 00:09:13,525
Not for you!

139
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:16,861
Finish the job, or you're fired!

140
00:09:25,803 --> 00:09:28,363
Why am I such a misfit?

141
00:09:28,406 --> 00:09:31,373
I am not just a nitwit

142
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:33,203
You can't fire me

143
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:34,709
I quit

144
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:37,402
Seems I don't fit in

145
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:44,879
Ah, weII.
Such is the Iife of an eIf.

146
00:09:44,915 --> 00:09:49,715
MeanwhiIe, RudoIph is having
his growing pains, too.

147
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:54,584
OId Donner is determined
to keep RudoIph's nose a secret.

148
00:09:55,288 --> 00:09:57,722
AII right, son. Try it on.

149
00:09:57,824 --> 00:10:01,281
I don't wanna.
Daddy, I don't Iike it.

150
00:10:01,327 --> 00:10:02,816
You'II Iike it and wear it.

151
00:10:02,861 --> 00:10:04,556
Oh, but, Daddy!

152
00:10:05,262 --> 00:10:07,559
It's not very comfortabIe!

153
00:10:07,597 --> 00:10:11,896
There are more important things
than comfort: seIf-respect.

154
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:14,833
Santa can't object to you now.

155
00:10:20,605 --> 00:10:24,563
Why am I such a misfit?

156
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:28,236
I am just not a nitwit

157
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:32,836
Just because my nose gIows

158
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:36,446
Why don't I fit in?

159
00:10:40,284 --> 00:10:43,081
And so time passes.

160
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:47,578
Christmas comes and goes on
scheduIe, and soon it is ApriI,

161
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:50,749
when aII the new fawns
come out with their foIks...

162
00:10:50,857 --> 00:10:56,452
to meet the other new fawns
and to be inspected by Santa.

163
00:10:57,862 --> 00:11:00,261
Now, don't worry
about your nose, son.

164
00:11:00,297 --> 00:11:03,093
Just get out there
and do your stuff.

165
00:11:03,131 --> 00:11:07,464
Remember, you're my IittIe buck.

166
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:14,864
Hi. My name's FirebaII.
What's yours?

167
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,875
-RudoIph.
-You can be my buddy.

168
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:20,432
-Where are we going?
-The reindeer games.

169
00:11:20,476 --> 00:11:21,773
Makes antIers grow.

170
00:11:21,877 --> 00:11:27,370
Besides, it's a great way to
show off in front of the does.

171
00:11:29,415 --> 00:11:31,280
Ah, youth.

172
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:34,614
MeanwhiIe, the eIves
are bustIing with activity.

173
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,779
Christmas is over, but they
stiII keep busy with Iessons...

174
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,218
in eIf improvement.

175
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:43,019
AII out for eIf practice!

176
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:45,949
Let's get this over with.

177
00:11:45,992 --> 00:11:48,426
I have to Iook over
the new deer.

178
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:52,122
OK, Santa. Let's try out
the new eIf song I wrote.

179
00:11:52,163 --> 00:11:54,960
And remember, it's for Santa.

180
00:11:54,998 --> 00:11:59,092
And a-1 and a-2 and a-3...

181
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:01,295
Ho ho ho, ho ho ho

182
00:12:01,336 --> 00:12:04,201
We are Santa's eIves

183
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:06,296
We are Santa's eIves

184
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:09,102
FiIIing Santa's sheIves

185
00:12:09,141 --> 00:12:10,970
With a toy
for each girI and boy

186
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:14,068
Oh, we are Santa's eIves

187
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,304
We work hard aII day

188
00:12:16,345 --> 00:12:18,642
But our work is pIay

189
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,546
DoIIs we try out,
see if they cry out

190
00:12:21,582 --> 00:12:24,049
We are Santa's eIves

191
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,142
We've a speciaI job each year

192
00:12:26,185 --> 00:12:29,118
We don't Iike to brag

193
00:12:29,153 --> 00:12:32,918
Christmas Eve
we aIways fiII Santa's bag

194
00:12:34,257 --> 00:12:36,314
Santa knows who's good

195
00:12:36,357 --> 00:12:39,121
Do the things you shouId

196
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,490
And we bet you
he won't forget you

197
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,361
We are Santa's eIves

198
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,333
We've a speciaI job each year

199
00:13:06,376 --> 00:13:09,004
We don't Iike to brag

200
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:13,036
Christmas Eve
we aIways fiII Santa's bag

201
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:16,515
Santa knows who's good

202
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,016
Do the things you shouId

203
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,519
And we bet you
he won't forget you

204
00:13:21,554 --> 00:13:24,419
We are Santa's eIves

205
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:26,685
Ho ho ho, ho ho ho

206
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:30,021
We are Santa's eIves, ho ho

207
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,722
Hmm. WeII, it needs work.
I have to go.

208
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:39,021
What does Papa know?

209
00:13:39,064 --> 00:13:42,862
It's beautifuI.
You keep it just the way it was.

210
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:45,400
Papa? Papa!

211
00:13:46,135 --> 00:13:48,535
That sounded terribIe!

212
00:13:48,571 --> 00:13:50,868
The tenor section was weak.

213
00:13:50,972 --> 00:13:53,530
Wasn't our fauIt, boss.
Hermey didn't show up.

214
00:13:53,573 --> 00:13:55,063
What?

215
00:13:56,241 --> 00:13:59,573
Now, this won't hurt a bit.

216
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,874
Why weren't you at eIf practice?

217
00:14:02,979 --> 00:14:04,970
Just fixing these doIIs' teeth.

218
00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:06,378
Just fixing--

219
00:14:06,414 --> 00:14:11,544
Now, Iisten! We have doIIs
that cry, taIk, waIk, bIink,

220
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:13,211
and run a temperature.

221
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,880
We don't need any chewing doIIs.

222
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:19,217
I just thought I found a way
to fit in.

223
00:14:19,256 --> 00:14:21,724
You'II never fit in!

224
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,215
You come to practice and Iearn
how to wiggIe your ears...

225
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,387
and chuckIe warmIy
and go ''hee hee'' and ''ho ho''

226
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:30,896
and important stuff Iike that.

227
00:14:30,997 --> 00:14:34,227
A dentist! Good grief!

228
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:39,895
No. I just can't.

229
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:44,266
It's Iike he said:
I'II never fit in.

230
00:14:48,608 --> 00:14:52,601
I guess I'm on my own now.

231
00:14:57,112 --> 00:15:00,275
Hey, Iook! Does!

232
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:05,751
What do you know?
One of them Iikes you.

233
00:15:05,786 --> 00:15:09,619
Yeah, FirebaII?
You reaIIy think so?

234
00:15:11,022 --> 00:15:13,547
Here comes the coach.

235
00:15:17,027 --> 00:15:19,084
AII right.
AII right, yearIings.

236
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,923
AII right, now!

237
00:15:21,028 --> 00:15:22,257
That's better.

238
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,263
My name is Comet.

239
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:27,924
Even though I'm your instructor,
I want to be your paI.

240
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:29,432
Right? Right.

241
00:15:29,468 --> 00:15:32,902
My job is to make bucks
out of you. Let's go.

242
00:15:34,638 --> 00:15:37,764
Now then, our first game
is caIIed Takeoff.

243
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:40,434
We aII want to puII
Santa's sIeigh someday,

244
00:15:40,475 --> 00:15:44,136
so we must Iearn to fIy.
Now, who's first to try?

245
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,302
Me! Me!

246
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:46,834
One at a time!

247
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,947
You're Dasher's IittIe boy,
aren't you?

248
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:55,949
You go first. The whoIe trick
is getting up enough speed...

249
00:15:56,051 --> 00:15:59,747
and jumping into the wind.
You got it? Go ahead.

250
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,123
Very good...for a first try.

251
00:16:08,158 --> 00:16:09,681
Next!

252
00:16:09,726 --> 00:16:14,719
He won't get to us for a whiIe.
Go get acquainted with that doe.

253
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:21,056
Nice day.

254
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:23,295
Yup.

255
00:16:23,335 --> 00:16:26,167
For takeoff practice, I mean.

256
00:16:26,837 --> 00:16:28,667
Yup.

257
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:30,696
I bet you'II be the best.

258
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,640
WeII, I don't know.

259
00:16:33,675 --> 00:16:39,134
Something wrong with your nose?
I mean, you taIk kind of funny.

260
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:42,977
What's so funny
about the way I taIk?

261
00:16:43,081 --> 00:16:45,877
Don't get angry. I don't mind.

262
00:16:45,915 --> 00:16:47,348
You don't?

263
00:16:48,518 --> 00:16:51,509
My name's CIarice. Hi.

264
00:16:52,352 --> 00:16:55,481
My name's RudoIph. Hi.

265
00:16:55,522 --> 00:16:56,988
Hi.

266
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:03,822
Hey, CIarice...
after practice, wouId you--

267
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:05,122
wouId you--

268
00:17:05,161 --> 00:17:07,823
RudoIph, you get back here!
It's your turn.

269
00:17:07,864 --> 00:17:12,129
Gee, I got to go back.
WouId you waIk home with me?

270
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,827
Uh-huh...RudoIph.

271
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,496
I think you're cute.

272
00:17:19,537 --> 00:17:21,004
I'm cute!

273
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:23,833
I'm cute!

274
00:17:23,873 --> 00:17:25,671
Magnificent!

275
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:27,834
I'm cute! I'm cute!

276
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:30,673
She said I'm cute!

277
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:36,405
Not bad. Not bad at aII.

278
00:17:37,115 --> 00:17:38,514
Hey, you're OK.

279
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,880
She said I'm cute!

280
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,517
For crying out Ioud!

281
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:54,218
FirebaII, what's the matter?

282
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:56,022
Get away from me!

283
00:17:56,127 --> 00:17:58,356
What's this nonsense here,
bucks?

284
00:17:58,395 --> 00:18:01,227
After aII--Aah!

285
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:05,528
Hey, Iook at the beak.

286
00:18:05,566 --> 00:18:07,193
Hey, Fire Snout!

287
00:18:07,234 --> 00:18:08,531
Rainbow puss!

288
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:09,865
Red schnoz!

289
00:18:09,903 --> 00:18:12,029
Stop caIIing me names!

290
00:18:12,137 --> 00:18:14,866
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer.

291
00:18:14,906 --> 00:18:17,873
Donner, you shouId be ashamed
of yourseIf.

292
00:18:17,907 --> 00:18:21,842
What a pity.
He had a nice takeoff, too.

293
00:18:23,244 --> 00:18:25,542
AII right now, yearIings.

294
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,876
Back to practice.

295
00:18:26,914 --> 00:18:28,881
Oh, no. Not you.

296
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:30,710
You better go home.

297
00:18:30,748 --> 00:18:31,875
From now on,

298
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:34,884
we won't Iet RudoIph join
in any reindeer games.

299
00:18:34,918 --> 00:18:36,909
Right! Right!

300
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,057
WeII, what do you want?

301
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:56,563
You promised to waIk me home.

302
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:59,226
Aren't you going to
Iaugh at my nose?

303
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:01,233
It's a handsome nose,

304
00:19:01,267 --> 00:19:04,236
much better than that faIse one
you were wearing.

305
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,896
It's terribIe.

306
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:08,065
It's different
from everybody eIse's.

307
00:19:08,173 --> 00:19:10,572
But that's
what makes it so grand.

308
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:14,270
Any doe wouId consider
herseIf Iucky to be with you.

309
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:16,309
Yeah?

310
00:19:17,278 --> 00:19:20,736
But I wasn't very Iucky
today, was I?

311
00:19:20,782 --> 00:19:22,441
I wish...

312
00:19:23,449 --> 00:19:25,574
I--I wish...

313
00:19:25,616 --> 00:19:32,919
There's aIways tomorrow
for dreams to come true

314
00:19:32,956 --> 00:19:39,756
BeIieve in your dreams,
come what may

315
00:19:39,793 --> 00:19:46,923
There's aIways tomorrow
with so much to do

316
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:54,596
And so IittIe time in a day

317
00:19:54,636 --> 00:20:01,266
We aII pretend
the rainbow has an end

318
00:20:01,306 --> 00:20:08,266
And you'II be there,
my friend, someday

319
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:15,272
There's aIways tomorrow
for dreams to come true

320
00:20:15,316 --> 00:20:21,946
Tomorrow is not far away

321
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:28,788
We aII pretend
the rainbow has an end

322
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:36,125
And you'II be there,
my friend, someday

323
00:20:36,228 --> 00:20:43,290
There's aIways tomorrow
for dreams to come true

324
00:20:43,332 --> 00:20:53,671
Tomorrow is not far away

325
00:21:02,245 --> 00:21:03,711
CIarice!

326
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:05,646
Get back to your cave!

327
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,307
-But I--
-This instant, young Iady!

328
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:09,645
Yes, sir.

329
00:21:09,683 --> 00:21:12,150
There's one thing
I want to make pIain:

330
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:17,778
no doe of mine wiII be seen
with a red-nosed reindeer!

331
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:27,122
Oh, is this your snowbank?

332
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,390
No. Who are you?

333
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:32,454
WeII, actuaIIy, I am a dentist.

334
00:21:32,498 --> 00:21:33,986
A dentist?

335
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:36,660
WeII, I want to be someday.

336
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:39,668
Right now, I'm just an eIf.

337
00:21:39,702 --> 00:21:41,499
But I don't need anybody.

338
00:21:41,537 --> 00:21:42,662
I'm...

339
00:21:42,704 --> 00:21:45,297
I'm independent.

340
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:47,829
Yeah? Me, too.

341
00:21:47,874 --> 00:21:50,864
I'm...whatever you said.

342
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:53,871
Independent.

343
00:21:55,845 --> 00:22:01,042
Hey, what do you say we both
be independent together, huh?

344
00:22:01,082 --> 00:22:05,643
You wouIdn't mind my red nose?

345
00:22:05,686 --> 00:22:09,677
Not if you don't mind me
being a dentist.

346
00:22:09,721 --> 00:22:11,745
It's a deaI.

347
00:22:13,557 --> 00:22:15,854
We're a coupIe of misfits

348
00:22:15,892 --> 00:22:18,189
We're a coupIe of misfits

349
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:20,193
What's the matter with misfits?

350
00:22:20,294 --> 00:22:22,352
That's where we fit in

351
00:22:22,395 --> 00:22:24,692
We're not daffy and diIIy

352
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,857
Don't go round wiIIy-niIIy

353
00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:29,024
Seems to us kind of siIIy

354
00:22:29,066 --> 00:22:31,193
That we don't fit in

355
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:35,532
We may be different
from the rest

356
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:40,438
Who decides the test
of what is reaIIy best?

357
00:22:40,474 --> 00:22:42,532
We're a coupIe of misfits

358
00:22:42,575 --> 00:22:44,543
We're a coupIe of misfits

359
00:22:44,577 --> 00:22:46,873
What's the matter with misfits?

360
00:22:46,911 --> 00:22:49,072
That's where we fit in

361
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:54,845
Why am I such a misfit?

362
00:22:54,883 --> 00:22:57,009
I am not just a nitwit

363
00:22:57,051 --> 00:22:58,880
I'm a dear of a reindeer

364
00:22:58,918 --> 00:23:01,046
Why don't I fit in?

365
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,213
Why am I such a misfit?

366
00:23:03,321 --> 00:23:05,379
I am not just a nitwit

367
00:23:05,422 --> 00:23:06,549
They can't fire me

368
00:23:06,591 --> 00:23:08,023
I quit

369
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:09,718
Seems I don't fit in

370
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:14,559
We may be different
from the rest

371
00:23:14,596 --> 00:23:18,724
Who decides the test
of what is reaIIy best?

372
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,891
We're a coupIe of misfits

373
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:23,400
We're a coupIe of misfits

374
00:23:23,434 --> 00:23:25,560
What's the matter with misfits?

375
00:23:25,602 --> 00:23:27,126
That's where we fit in

376
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,733
These two had no idea

377
00:23:33,774 --> 00:23:36,402
about what they were
Ietting themseIves in for.

378
00:23:36,443 --> 00:23:40,070
The worId Iooked a Iot more
compIicated and dangerous...

379
00:23:40,112 --> 00:23:43,774
than it seemed when they were
snug and warm at home.

380
00:23:49,784 --> 00:23:52,252
The AbominabIe!
He must see your nose.

381
00:23:52,353 --> 00:23:54,444
Quick, douse the Iight.

382
00:23:59,957 --> 00:24:05,622
Like I said, the outside worId
is up to its ears in danger.

383
00:24:20,637 --> 00:24:23,434
WeII, somehow RudoIph and Hermey

384
00:24:23,472 --> 00:24:25,872
managed to get through
the first night.

385
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:30,400
Mush!

386
00:24:34,146 --> 00:24:38,138
Mush. Don't you understand
North PoIe taIk?

387
00:24:39,383 --> 00:24:40,973
What's this?

388
00:24:42,985 --> 00:24:45,612
Hey, you get frostbit that way.

389
00:24:45,653 --> 00:24:46,779
Who are you?

390
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,617
Who am I?

391
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:51,122
The name's Yukon CorneIius,

392
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:54,283
the greatest prospector
in the North!

393
00:24:54,391 --> 00:24:58,952
This is my Iand,
and it's rich with goId.

394
00:24:58,995 --> 00:25:00,962
GoId!

395
00:25:00,996 --> 00:25:05,091
GoId and siIver.
SiIver and goId.

396
00:25:05,132 --> 00:25:07,530
Wahoo!

397
00:25:10,503 --> 00:25:12,162
Nothing.

398
00:25:14,405 --> 00:25:16,304
SiIver and goId.

399
00:25:16,406 --> 00:25:19,135
What do you think
of our friend CorneIius?

400
00:25:19,175 --> 00:25:23,133
Seems aII he thinks about
is siIver and goId.

401
00:25:23,178 --> 00:25:25,974
SiIver and goId

402
00:25:26,012 --> 00:25:28,946
SiIver and goId

403
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,643
Everyone wishes
for siIver and goId

404
00:25:33,684 --> 00:25:38,813
How do you measure its worth?

405
00:25:38,854 --> 00:25:41,878
Just by the pIeasure

406
00:25:41,922 --> 00:25:48,325
It gives here on earth

407
00:25:48,426 --> 00:25:51,156
SiIver and goId

408
00:25:51,196 --> 00:25:53,822
SiIver and goId

409
00:25:53,863 --> 00:25:59,163
Means so much more when I see

410
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,159
SiIver and goId decorations

411
00:26:04,204 --> 00:26:10,334
On every Christmas tree

412
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,838
What's a Christmas tree...

413
00:26:11,874 --> 00:26:15,673
without pretty siIver
and goId decorations?

414
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:19,075
Can't reaIIy caII it
a Christmas tree, right?

415
00:26:19,112 --> 00:26:23,014
Think of aII the joy that wouId
be Iost on Christmas morning...

416
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:28,212
if the young foIks didn't
see that sparkIing, happy tree.

417
00:26:28,885 --> 00:26:31,682
SiIver and goId

418
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,348
SiIver and goId

419
00:26:34,456 --> 00:26:39,687
Means so much more when I see

420
00:26:39,726 --> 00:26:46,026
SiIver and goId decorations

421
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:58,062
On every Christmas tree

422
00:26:59,471 --> 00:27:03,030
I'm off to get my suppIies:

423
00:27:03,073 --> 00:27:06,200
cornmeaI, gunpowder, hamhocks,
and guitar strings.

424
00:27:06,242 --> 00:27:09,075
I'II give you a Iift.
Hop aboard, mateys.

425
00:27:09,912 --> 00:27:12,072
Now, mush!

426
00:27:17,483 --> 00:27:21,076
Like this. Watch.

427
00:27:33,092 --> 00:27:34,560
Gadzooks!

428
00:27:34,594 --> 00:27:37,755
The BumbIe Snow Monster
of the North strikes again.

429
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:42,130
It's my nose!
It keeps giving us away.

430
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,696
I hate noisy
bumbIe snow monsters.

431
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:56,204
We'II outwit the fiend
with our superior inteIIigence.

432
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:58,400
-How?
-Douse your nose...

433
00:27:58,508 --> 00:28:00,601
and run Iike crazy!

434
00:28:00,644 --> 00:28:04,601
Come on! Wahoo!

435
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:18,251
We're trapped.
There's no way out!

436
00:28:18,288 --> 00:28:20,347
It's my nose again.

437
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,118
It's ruined us.

438
00:28:26,694 --> 00:28:30,026
The bumbIe has one weakness,
and I know it.

439
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,699
Do-it-yourseIf icebergs.

440
00:28:45,271 --> 00:28:48,535
Observe:
the bumbIe's one weakness.

441
00:28:54,278 --> 00:28:56,302
The bumbIe sinks.

442
00:29:02,082 --> 00:29:04,549
Yukon CorneIius scores again!

443
00:29:04,584 --> 00:29:06,984
Whoopee!

444
00:29:10,321 --> 00:29:11,982
Nothing.

445
00:29:12,723 --> 00:29:15,588
Mister, where are we going?

446
00:29:15,624 --> 00:29:16,955
You'II stay with me.

447
00:29:16,992 --> 00:29:20,449
We'II aII be rich with
the biggest siIver strike...

448
00:29:20,561 --> 00:29:22,459
this side of Hudson Bay.

449
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:25,428
SiIver!

450
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:27,795
I thought you wanted goId.

451
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:30,163
I changed my mind.

452
00:29:31,568 --> 00:29:34,468
Our friends were reaIIy
on their way,

453
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:37,663
but not one of them knew
where they were going.

454
00:29:39,672 --> 00:29:41,469
You can bet oId Donner

455
00:29:41,574 --> 00:29:45,031
feIt bad about the way
he had treated RudoIph.

456
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:47,476
He knew the onIy thing to do...

457
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:50,842
was to go out and Iook
for his IittIe buck.

458
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,642
Mrs. Donner wanted to go aIong,
naturaIIy,

459
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:57,980
but Donner said, ''No,
this is man's work.''

460
00:29:58,018 --> 00:30:00,644
No sooner did
the man of the house Ieave...

461
00:30:00,685 --> 00:30:05,018
when Mrs. Donner and CIarice
decided to set out on their own.

462
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:09,148
Now, they were reaIIy
taking their chances

463
00:30:09,191 --> 00:30:12,648
because, you see,
that IittIe ice boat...

464
00:30:12,693 --> 00:30:16,856
had run into a pack
of mighty wicked fog.

465
00:30:17,364 --> 00:30:21,493
HeIIo!

466
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,930
The fog is thick
as peanut butter.

467
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:28,198
-You mean pea soup.
-You eat what you Iike.

468
00:30:31,406 --> 00:30:35,602
Land ho!

469
00:30:35,642 --> 00:30:37,199
No kidding.

470
00:30:37,242 --> 00:30:39,607
WeII, where are we?

471
00:30:44,047 --> 00:30:47,174
Hey! Looky up there!

472
00:30:47,216 --> 00:30:49,046
Oh!

473
00:30:50,985 --> 00:30:52,975
HaIt! Who goes there?

474
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,782
Us, of course.

475
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,514
WeII, then that's OK.

476
00:30:56,621 --> 00:31:00,112
OK? Who, may I ask, are you?

477
00:31:00,157 --> 00:31:05,115
We're RudoIph, Hermey, and
Yukon CorneIius. Who are you?

478
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,890
I'm the officiaI sentry
of the IsIand of Misfit Toys.

479
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:10,896
A jack-in-the-box for a sentry?

480
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,295
Yes. My name is--

481
00:31:12,332 --> 00:31:14,265
Don't teII me. Jack.

482
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,200
No. CharIie.

483
00:31:16,235 --> 00:31:19,202
That's why I'm a misfit toy.

484
00:31:19,236 --> 00:31:21,033
My name is aII wrong.

485
00:31:21,071 --> 00:31:24,368
No chiId wants to pIay
with a charIie-in-the-box,

486
00:31:24,406 --> 00:31:26,397
so I had to come here.

487
00:31:26,441 --> 00:31:28,408
Where's here?

488
00:31:30,076 --> 00:31:36,206
We're on the isIand
of misfit toys

489
00:31:36,247 --> 00:31:42,047
Here we don't want to stay

490
00:31:42,084 --> 00:31:47,713
We want to traveI
with Santa CIaus

491
00:31:47,753 --> 00:31:54,418
In his magic sIeigh

492
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:56,049
A pack fuII of toys

493
00:31:56,092 --> 00:31:58,219
Means a sack fuII of joys

494
00:31:58,261 --> 00:31:59,728
For miIIions of girIs

495
00:31:59,762 --> 00:32:02,092
And for miIIions of boys

496
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:05,222
When Christmas day is here

497
00:32:05,265 --> 00:32:09,166
The most wonderfuI day
of the year

498
00:32:09,201 --> 00:32:10,725
A jack-in-the-box

499
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:13,167
Waits for chiIdren to shout

500
00:32:13,203 --> 00:32:17,104
Wake up! Don't you know
it's time to come out?

501
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:20,232
When Christmas day is here

502
00:32:20,275 --> 00:32:24,573
The most wonderfuI day
of the year

503
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:27,737
Toys gaIore

504
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,406
Scattered on the fIoor

505
00:32:31,448 --> 00:32:35,076
There's no room for more

506
00:32:35,117 --> 00:32:39,553
And it's aII because
of Santa CIaus

507
00:32:39,587 --> 00:32:41,487
A scooter for Jimmy

508
00:32:41,521 --> 00:32:43,078
A doIIy for Sue

509
00:32:43,122 --> 00:32:45,248
The kind that wiII even say

510
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,155
''How do you do?''

511
00:32:47,192 --> 00:32:50,251
When Christmas day is here

512
00:32:50,294 --> 00:32:54,457
The most wonderfuI day
of the year

513
00:32:55,963 --> 00:32:59,399
How wouId you Iike to be
a spotted eIephant?

514
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:03,390
Or a choo-choo with
square wheeIs on your caboose?

515
00:33:03,435 --> 00:33:06,801
Or a water pistoI
that shoots jeIIy?

516
00:33:06,838 --> 00:33:09,805
We're aII misfits!

517
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:12,602
WouId you Iike to be
a bird that doesn't fIy?

518
00:33:12,707 --> 00:33:14,072
I swim!

519
00:33:14,109 --> 00:33:18,568
Or a cowboy
who rides an ostrich?

520
00:33:18,612 --> 00:33:21,704
Or a boat
that can't stay afIoat.

521
00:33:21,747 --> 00:33:24,113
We're aII misfits!

522
00:33:24,149 --> 00:33:27,776
If we're on the IsIand
of Unwanted Toys

523
00:33:27,817 --> 00:33:29,284
We'II miss aII the fun

524
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:31,616
With the girIs and the boys

525
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,950
When Christmas day is here

526
00:33:34,989 --> 00:33:37,456
The most wonderfuI, wonderfuI

527
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:39,457
WonderfuI, wonderfuI

528
00:33:39,491 --> 00:33:44,257
WonderfuI day of the year

529
00:33:45,629 --> 00:33:50,087
Hey, we're aII misfits, too.
Maybe we couId stay for a whiIe.

530
00:33:50,132 --> 00:33:53,794
You'd have to get permission
from King Moonraiser.

531
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:54,959
Who's he?

532
00:33:55,001 --> 00:33:56,467
He ruIes here.

533
00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:59,471
Every night,
he searches the entire earth.

534
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:03,962
When he finds a misfit toy,
one that no girI or boy Ioves,

535
00:34:04,006 --> 00:34:07,964
he brings it to Iive here
tiII someone wants it.

536
00:34:08,009 --> 00:34:11,342
He's hoIding court in his castIe
right now.

537
00:34:15,448 --> 00:34:17,004
Come cIoser.

538
00:34:17,749 --> 00:34:19,580
What do you desire?

539
00:34:19,618 --> 00:34:22,642
We're a coupIe of misfits
from Christmas Town,

540
00:34:22,752 --> 00:34:25,549
and now we'd Iike to Iive here.

541
00:34:25,587 --> 00:34:27,486
No. That wouId not be possibIe.

542
00:34:27,522 --> 00:34:30,081
This isIand is for toys aIone.

543
00:34:30,123 --> 00:34:34,581
How do you Iike that? Even
among misfits, you're misfits.

544
00:34:34,626 --> 00:34:35,821
UnIike pIaythings,

545
00:34:35,861 --> 00:34:38,987
a Iiving creature cannot hide
himseIf on an isIand.

546
00:34:39,029 --> 00:34:41,997
But, perhaps,
being misfits yourseIves,

547
00:34:42,031 --> 00:34:44,498
you might heIp the toys here.

548
00:34:44,533 --> 00:34:45,966
HeIp them?

549
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:49,492
Yes. When someday
you return to Christmas Town,

550
00:34:49,537 --> 00:34:52,663
wouId you teII Santa
about our homeIess toys?

551
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:57,502
I'm sure he couId find chiIdren
who wouId be happy with them.

552
00:34:57,541 --> 00:35:02,842
A toy is never truIy happy
untiI it is Ioved by a chiId.

553
00:35:02,878 --> 00:35:07,246
When and if we ever get back,
we'II teII Santa, sir.

554
00:35:07,282 --> 00:35:10,681
Good. You are free
to spend the night.

555
00:35:10,782 --> 00:35:12,340
Footman!

556
00:35:12,384 --> 00:35:15,546
Show our friends
to their chambers.

557
00:35:18,053 --> 00:35:19,851
No. It's aII settIed.

558
00:35:19,889 --> 00:35:21,855
We Ieave tomorrow together.

559
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:25,847
But the AbominabIe
wiII see my nose and get us aII.

560
00:35:25,892 --> 00:35:27,654
I've got to go aIone.

561
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:29,853
Nonsense. It's aII for aII...

562
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:31,191
I mean, one...

563
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,526
Ah, Iet's get some shuteye.

564
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:36,054
-But--
-It's aII settIed.

565
00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:43,366
WeII, poor RudoIph reaIizes...

566
00:35:43,404 --> 00:35:47,236
that he can't endanger
his friends' Iives anymore.

567
00:35:48,072 --> 00:35:51,700
And so, that night,

568
00:35:51,808 --> 00:35:55,243
he decides to strike out
on his own.

569
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,548
Good-bye, CorneIius.

570
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:05,880
I hope you find Iots of tinseI.

571
00:36:05,917 --> 00:36:08,044
Good-bye, Hermey.

572
00:36:08,086 --> 00:36:11,179
Whatever a dentist is,

573
00:36:11,222 --> 00:36:12,710
I hope, someday,

574
00:36:12,821 --> 00:36:15,415
that you're the greatest.

575
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,729
WeII, time passed sIowIy.

576
00:36:28,831 --> 00:36:31,824
RudoIph existed
as best he couId.

577
00:36:32,834 --> 00:36:36,234
The snow monster
kept him on the run...

578
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:40,672
but once in a whiIe, he wouId
stop and make a friend or two.

579
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,604
But it wouIdn't Iast Iong,
and RudoIph wouId be on his own.

580
00:36:48,612 --> 00:36:50,408
But during aII that time,

581
00:36:50,446 --> 00:36:54,938
a strange and wonderfuI thing
was happening.

582
00:36:57,851 --> 00:37:00,409
RudoIph was growing up,

583
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:04,581
and growing up made RudoIph
reaIize you can't run away...

584
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,612
from your troubIes.

585
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:13,123
And pretty soon he knew
where he had to go: home.

586
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:20,592
You! I thought
you were gone for good.

587
00:37:20,632 --> 00:37:23,657
Hey, Iook who's back:
oId Neon Nose!

588
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,764
Mom? Pa?

589
00:37:30,871 --> 00:37:32,168
I'm home!

590
00:37:32,973 --> 00:37:35,304
They're gone, RudoIph.

591
00:37:36,476 --> 00:37:39,932
They've been gone for months
Iooking for you.

592
00:37:39,977 --> 00:37:41,273
CIarice?

593
00:37:41,311 --> 00:37:43,278
She's gone, too.
I'm very worried.

594
00:37:43,312 --> 00:37:45,610
Christmas Eve
is onIy two days off,

595
00:37:45,648 --> 00:37:47,114
and without your father,

596
00:37:47,148 --> 00:37:51,083
I'II never be abIe to get
my sIeigh off the ground.

597
00:37:51,118 --> 00:37:52,779
Gone?

598
00:37:52,886 --> 00:37:56,786
I'II find him, sir.
I'II find them aII.

599
00:37:56,888 --> 00:38:01,983
WeII, he was just about
to Ieave when suddenIy...

600
00:38:03,326 --> 00:38:04,986
It hit!

601
00:38:06,328 --> 00:38:09,353
The storm of storms,

602
00:38:09,397 --> 00:38:13,491
and onIy two days
before Christmas Eve.

603
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:28,304
RudoIph knew that he had to
find his foIks right away,

604
00:38:28,341 --> 00:38:31,468
and he knew
where he had to Iook:

605
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:36,673
the cave
of the AbominabIe Snow Monster.

606
00:38:44,585 --> 00:38:47,019
Put her down!

607
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:14,028
TeII me when it's over.

608
00:39:15,537 --> 00:39:19,165
Oh, where was I?
Their Iast chance.

609
00:39:19,206 --> 00:39:21,833
Not quite. You see,
ever since RudoIph Ieft them,

610
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:26,001
Hermey and Yukon CorneIius
had tried to find their friend.

611
00:39:26,044 --> 00:39:30,673
They arrived in Christmas Town
just as the storm hit.

612
00:39:30,715 --> 00:39:35,048
It was a good thing that I sent
them right out after RudoIph.

613
00:39:41,855 --> 00:39:44,220
Hey, Iook!

614
00:39:46,123 --> 00:39:47,955
Whoa!

615
00:39:50,226 --> 00:39:52,955
Unmush, wiII you?

616
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:01,529
What do we do? We can't Iet
that monster get ahoId of them.

617
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:04,558
I got an idea. Listen.

618
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:07,400
-Yes.
-And then...

619
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,037
Not bad.

620
00:40:10,071 --> 00:40:12,302
It might work.

621
00:40:16,509 --> 00:40:18,977
Why doesn't he get it over with?

622
00:40:19,012 --> 00:40:21,707
Pa? Ma?

623
00:40:21,747 --> 00:40:23,680
CIarice!

624
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:26,443
Are you sure we can get him out?

625
00:40:26,483 --> 00:40:29,542
Never knew the bumbIe
snow monster yet...

626
00:40:29,585 --> 00:40:32,553
who'd turn down a pork dinner
for deer meat.

627
00:40:32,587 --> 00:40:35,248
Do your stuff!

628
00:40:36,422 --> 00:40:38,049
Oink oink.

629
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:39,716
Put some heart in it!

630
00:40:39,758 --> 00:40:42,192
That bumbIe's hungry!

631
00:40:53,432 --> 00:40:57,299
Wahoo!

632
00:40:57,335 --> 00:40:59,599
TerribIe weather
we've been having.

633
00:41:00,271 --> 00:41:02,602
Snow and ice.

634
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:13,409
AII right, dentist,
you take it from here.

635
00:41:13,447 --> 00:41:15,845
It's Yukon CorneIius!

636
00:41:15,881 --> 00:41:18,405
Ta-da! In person.

637
00:41:18,449 --> 00:41:19,575
We're saved!

638
00:41:19,617 --> 00:41:21,413
Let's get outta here.

639
00:41:21,451 --> 00:41:24,145
I'II Iight the way.

640
00:41:26,721 --> 00:41:30,520
Why, bIast your hairy
bumbIe hide.

641
00:41:30,557 --> 00:41:33,582
Don't Iet this big bIowhard
scare you anymore.

642
00:41:33,626 --> 00:41:36,286
Just waIk right past him.

643
00:41:44,031 --> 00:41:49,468
I teII you, you're Iooking
at a mighty humbIe bumbIe.

644
00:41:53,137 --> 00:41:55,662
He's nothing
without his choppers.

645
00:41:55,707 --> 00:41:56,934
Let me at him.

646
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,599
Wahoo!

647
00:42:10,449 --> 00:42:12,075
Yukon!

648
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:15,113
He's gone!

649
00:42:15,151 --> 00:42:18,243
Oh, he's gone!

650
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:22,619
WeII, they are aII very sad
at the Ioss of their friend,

651
00:42:22,656 --> 00:42:25,625
but they reaIize that
the best thing to do...

652
00:42:25,659 --> 00:42:28,285
is get the women back
to Christmas Town.

653
00:42:28,326 --> 00:42:32,284
So they make it back and when
everybody hears their story,

654
00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:33,796
they start to reaIize...

655
00:42:33,831 --> 00:42:37,287
maybe they were a IittIe hard
on the misfits.

656
00:42:37,332 --> 00:42:40,528
Maybe misfits have a pIace, too.

657
00:42:40,568 --> 00:42:45,629
Even Santa reaIizes
that maybe he was wrong.

658
00:42:45,671 --> 00:42:49,628
RudoIph, I promise, as soon
as this storm Iets up,

659
00:42:49,673 --> 00:42:53,972
I'II find homes
for aII those misfit toys.

660
00:42:54,076 --> 00:42:57,476
AII right. You can open up
a dentist office.

661
00:42:57,512 --> 00:42:59,638
Next week, after Christmas.

662
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,840
Come here. Open your mouth.

663
00:43:03,082 --> 00:43:04,640
Oh, dear.

664
00:43:04,684 --> 00:43:07,810
I'II set up an appointment
for you: week from Tuesday,

665
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:10,217
4:30 sharp.

666
00:43:10,253 --> 00:43:13,516
I'm sorry, too, RudoIph,
for the way I acted.

667
00:43:14,523 --> 00:43:15,989
Open up!

668
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:19,285
It isn't a fit night out
for man nor beast!

669
00:43:23,094 --> 00:43:24,652
Here's the man...

670
00:43:24,696 --> 00:43:27,129
and here's the beast!

671
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:33,329
Now, caIm down.
I reformed this bumbIe.

672
00:43:33,368 --> 00:43:35,494
He wants a job.

673
00:43:35,536 --> 00:43:38,197
Looky what he can do.

674
00:43:41,373 --> 00:43:44,568
And he doesn't even need
a stepIadder.

675
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:49,643
But...but...you went over
the side of the cIiff.

676
00:43:49,677 --> 00:43:52,168
Didn't I ever teII you
about bumbIes?

677
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:53,941
BumbIes bounce!

678
00:43:58,117 --> 00:44:00,174
WeII, as good as everyone feeIs,

679
00:44:00,217 --> 00:44:02,344
this is no time
for ceIebrating...

680
00:44:02,386 --> 00:44:06,185
because the next day
is Christmas Eve--

681
00:44:06,222 --> 00:44:08,553
the biggest day of the year.

682
00:44:10,591 --> 00:44:12,582
Eat, Papa, eat.

683
00:44:12,627 --> 00:44:16,823
How can I eat? That siIIy
eIf song is driving me crazy.

684
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,193
You're going to disappoint
the chiIdren.

685
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,789
They expect a fat Santa.

686
00:44:22,566 --> 00:44:24,897
Latest weather report, sir.

687
00:44:25,867 --> 00:44:28,028
WeII, this is it.

688
00:44:28,136 --> 00:44:31,194
The storm won't subside
by tonight.

689
00:44:31,237 --> 00:44:35,195
We'II have to canceI Christmas.

690
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,265
Papa, are you sure?

691
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:40,708
Everything's grounded!

692
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:42,541
Oh, the poor kids.

693
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:45,546
They've been so good
this year, too.

694
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,877
But I couIdn't chance it.

695
00:44:47,915 --> 00:44:52,248
I'II have to teII everybody
that it's aII off this year.

696
00:44:54,252 --> 00:44:55,878
Quiet! Quiet!

697
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,378
PIease, everybody quiet!

698
00:44:59,423 --> 00:45:02,754
I've got some bad news, foIks.

699
00:45:03,692 --> 00:45:06,922
Christmas is
going to be canceIed.

700
00:45:07,761 --> 00:45:09,557
There's nothing I can do.

701
00:45:09,595 --> 00:45:11,563
This weather--

702
00:45:11,597 --> 00:45:13,723
RudoIph, RudoIph, pIease!

703
00:45:13,765 --> 00:45:18,928
CouId you tone it down a bit?
I mean, that nose of yours.

704
00:45:19,435 --> 00:45:21,731
That nose!

705
00:45:21,769 --> 00:45:25,670
That beautifuI, wonderfuI nose!

706
00:45:25,705 --> 00:45:29,402
-Huh?
-RudoIph, Christmas is not off,

707
00:45:29,442 --> 00:45:32,534
and you're
going to Iead my team.

708
00:45:32,577 --> 00:45:33,703
I am?

709
00:45:33,744 --> 00:45:37,736
Yes, sir. You and that
wonderfuI nose of yours.

710
00:45:37,781 --> 00:45:39,906
My nose, sir?

711
00:45:39,948 --> 00:45:41,575
From what I see now,

712
00:45:41,616 --> 00:45:45,414
that'II cut through the murkiest
storm they can dish up.

713
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,578
What I'm trying to say is...

714
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:51,076
RudoIph,
with your nose so bright,

715
00:45:51,188 --> 00:45:54,918
won't you guide
my sIeigh tonight?

716
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:57,221
It wiII be an honor, sir.

717
00:45:59,527 --> 00:46:03,189
I knew that nose
wouId be usefuI someday.

718
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:12,594
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas

719
00:46:12,635 --> 00:46:15,398
It's the best time of the year

720
00:46:15,437 --> 00:46:17,837
I don't know if there'II be snow

721
00:46:17,873 --> 00:46:20,067
But have a cup of cheer

722
00:46:20,107 --> 00:46:22,596
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas

723
00:46:22,641 --> 00:46:25,438
And when you waIk
down the street

724
00:46:25,476 --> 00:46:27,774
Say heIIo to friends you know

725
00:46:27,812 --> 00:46:30,371
And everyone you meet

726
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,937
Ho, ho, the mistIetoe

727
00:46:32,982 --> 00:46:35,541
Hung where you can see

728
00:46:35,583 --> 00:46:38,210
Somebody waits for you

729
00:46:38,252 --> 00:46:40,344
Kiss her once for me

730
00:46:40,386 --> 00:46:42,945
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas

731
00:46:42,988 --> 00:46:45,785
And in case you didn't hear

732
00:46:45,823 --> 00:46:46,948
Oh, by goIIy

733
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:51,653
Have a hoIIy, joIIy
Christmas this year

734
00:47:00,132 --> 00:47:01,463
HoIIy, joIIy

735
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,796
HoIIy, joIIy

736
00:47:02,834 --> 00:47:04,892
Oooohhhhhh

737
00:47:04,935 --> 00:47:07,426
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas

738
00:47:07,471 --> 00:47:10,404
And in case you didn't hear

739
00:47:10,438 --> 00:47:14,965
Oh, by goIIy,
have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas

740
00:47:15,009 --> 00:47:18,842
This year

741
00:47:24,515 --> 00:47:27,482
Eat now. ''Ho ho ho'' Iater.

742
00:47:27,516 --> 00:47:29,813
Let me check. Turn.

743
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:31,648
Oh, Mama!

744
00:47:31,686 --> 00:47:34,244
Now, shake when you Iaugh.

745
00:47:36,489 --> 00:47:39,787
Now, that's my Santa.

746
00:47:39,824 --> 00:47:43,690
Oh, thanks, Mama. My coat!

747
00:47:46,861 --> 00:47:48,624
Ready, RudoIph?

748
00:47:48,663 --> 00:47:50,391
Ready, Santa!

749
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:52,830
WeII, Iet's be on our way.

750
00:47:52,866 --> 00:47:57,028
OK, RudoIph. FuII power!

751
00:48:00,137 --> 00:48:04,868
First stop,
the IsIand of Misfit Toys.

752
00:48:05,573 --> 00:48:11,271
Up, up, up, and away!

753
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,179
He'II be a hero after this.

754
00:48:17,281 --> 00:48:19,180
Yes, a hero.

755
00:48:19,282 --> 00:48:22,682
That's my buck!

756
00:48:22,718 --> 00:48:25,344
Now, you see how it's done?

757
00:48:25,385 --> 00:48:28,377
Wahoo!

758
00:48:32,058 --> 00:48:36,015
Peppermint! What I've
been searching for aII my Iife!

759
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,526
I've struck it rich!

760
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,188
I've got me a peppermint mine!

761
00:48:40,296 --> 00:48:42,728
Wahoo!

762
00:48:49,068 --> 00:48:52,628
WeII, it's Christmas Eve, but...

763
00:48:53,738 --> 00:48:57,833
Looks Iike
we're forgotten again.

764
00:48:57,874 --> 00:49:02,366
But RudoIph promised
we'd go this time.

765
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:06,469
Guess the storm
was too much for them.

766
00:49:09,648 --> 00:49:15,312
Might just as weII go to bed and
start dreaming about next year.

767
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:18,717
I haven't any dreams Ieft
to dream.

768
00:49:18,753 --> 00:49:21,983
We'II never get off this isIand.

769
00:49:22,022 --> 00:49:23,546
Wait a minute.

770
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:25,056
What's that?

771
00:49:25,091 --> 00:49:26,991
Is it...is it...

772
00:49:27,026 --> 00:49:29,959
It sure is! It's Santa!

773
00:49:29,994 --> 00:49:32,723
And Iook!
RudoIph is Ieading the way!

774
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:35,787
You can see his nose from here.

775
00:49:41,601 --> 00:49:44,068
WeII, Iet's be on our way.

776
00:49:47,005 --> 00:49:48,495
Ready, RudoIph?

777
00:49:48,539 --> 00:49:50,232
Ready, Santa!

778
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:54,775
OK, RudoIph. FuII power!

779
00:49:57,445 --> 00:50:02,606
Up, up, up, and away!

780
00:50:03,682 --> 00:50:07,411
WeII, foIks, as for
the rest of the story...

781
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:11,249
He went down in history

782
00:50:11,353 --> 00:50:13,912
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer

783
00:50:13,955 --> 00:50:16,582
Had a very shiny nose

784
00:50:16,623 --> 00:50:19,091
And if you ever saw it

785
00:50:19,126 --> 00:50:21,753
You wouId even say it gIows

786
00:50:21,794 --> 00:50:24,420
AII of the other reindeer

787
00:50:24,461 --> 00:50:27,088
Used to Iaugh and caII him names

788
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:29,428
They never Iet poor RudoIph
