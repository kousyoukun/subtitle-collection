1
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,207
Today is a good day to die.

2
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:11,380
What's happening?
It's crack. Get some help.

3
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,716
So many crackheads, we don't
have time for anybody else.

4
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,344
What have we got?
Some kind of hemorrhage.

5
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,012
Husband brought her in a taxi.
Blood pressure?

6
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,390
90 over 60 and dropping…

7
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,059
Vaginal bleeding?
What's he saying?

8
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,644
Jeez, it's probably
a street abortion.

9
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,854
Probably the uterine artery.

10
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,522
Come on!
We've got to open her up.

11
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,233
All the OR's are full.
It'll be another 10 minutes.

12
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,068
Yeah, well, that's too late.
Ger her under.

13
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,361
Who's gonna do the surgery?

14
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,196
- I am.
- You can't!

15
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,531
Just do it!

16
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,326
Get him out of here.
Get him out of here!

17
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:48,417
Fifteen years on the job and you're
gonna get me canned in one day. You're crazy.

18
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,169
All right, here we go.
Shh! Shh! Shh!

19
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,922
All right, forceps!

20
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,134
Where the hell is it? Where is it?
Where is it? Clamp! Clamp!

21
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,927
Get it, Dave. Get it.

22
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,139
You got her.
All right, I've got her.

23
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,100
- Dave, get out of here. Now!
- I tried to stop him.

24
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:11,607
Labraccio! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

25
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:34,796
Randall STECKLE, "Diary
of a Surgeon." Not a surgeon yet.

26
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:38,508
Randall STECKLE,
"Diary of a Surgeon-to-be."

27
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,010
No, wimpy.

28
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,931
Randall STECKLE,
"Making of a…" Pbbt!

29
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:48,477
Randall STECKLE, "Forging of
a Surgeon." No, pretentious.

30
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:53,315
Randall STECKLE, "Genesis"?

31
00:03:54,025 --> 00:04:00,322
Randall STECKLE, "Genesis of
a Young Surgeon." Brilliant!

32
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,508
Morning.

33
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:24,554
Nice work. Keep it up.

34
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:36,024
Suddenly, even though
I was in a coma, I saw myself.

35
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:40,487
Like, from above, looking down.

36
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:46,201
Ralph, my husband, was crying.

37
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:50,539
And the doctor was
saying I was dying.

38
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:55,043
And I saw myself in
the bed and everything.

39
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:59,548
And I started to float out
into the hall.

40
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:06,555
And then into this tunnel
toward this light.

41
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:12,019
And it was the most
beautiful light I ever saw.

42
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:16,273
And I heard this voice.

43
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:21,570
And it was the most
beautiful voice I ever heard.

44
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:25,240
And it said,

45
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:29,202
"I'm going to take your baby."

46
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:35,584
"But you are going back."

47
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,296
And I woke up,

48
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:43,925
and there was Ralph
and the doctor.

49
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:50,599
I was legally dead
for four and a half minutes.

50
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:55,604
But I didn't see no tunnel
and I didn't see no light.

51
00:05:55,772 --> 00:06:00,108
Oh, I did and it was so beautiful!
Shh.

52
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:04,821
I was in this garden…
TERRY: This tunnel and this light,

53
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:10,911
and then this… Like, a guide,
and a chariot and music.

54
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,915
Terry, I think they'd better
get you off medication.

55
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,753
Thanks.

56
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,467
What's up?
Good morning.

57
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,220
There's trouble in ER.
Better watch your ass today.

58
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,429
Thanks.

59
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:33,308
Why are you always asking
the patients about death anyway?

60
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:37,312
I'm gonna be late for
class. Thanks, Edna.

61
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:43,777
The spoils of arthritis. Some
rather resilient inflammatory tissue here.

62
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,155
Trying to sever…
Come on, damn it.

63
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,574
We're now beneath the
transverse arch of the foot.

64
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,327
The three cuneiforms,
the five metatarsals.

65
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:57,499
Brilliant, Dr. STECKLE. You be sure to bring
all that talent with you tonight, okay?

66
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:03,880
Nelson, about tonight. It's because I like you as much
as I do that I have to decline on moral grounds.

67
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,301
Look, isn't there enough atrocity in the
world without your own little horror?

68
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,179
Horror? STECKLE,
it's ignorance we fear.

69
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:15,475
Since when did truth and
knowledge become a horror?

70
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:19,229
Especially to a scientist
and a genius like yourself.

71
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,532
Good morning, Mannus?
How you doing?

72
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,659
Fine.

73
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:37,164
I've been meaning to ask you
something, are you dating anyone?

74
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:41,251
Identify.
Costodiaphragmatic recess.

75
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,421
Look, it's not offensive
if I make conversation, is it?

76
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:49,843
I mean, sometimes it's nice to open up,
that's all. Like old Lenny here, he's open.

77
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,928
Identify.
Pylorus.

78
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,972
Look,

79
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,018
I've heard all the rumors and
nicknames about you, Rachel.

80
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:03,231
But I'm sure you're a very warm woman.
Not the least bit frigid or repressed.

81
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,403
Identify.
Your brains.

82
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,905
- Good.
- Mm-hm.

83
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:13,742
So you wanna come over to my place?
Where we can do some more serious thinking.

84
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,828
Excuse me, Dr. Hurley,
I need a word with Dr. Mannus.

85
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,371
Sure.

86
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,626
Didn't I already say no to this?

87
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,086
Look, I've already got
STECKLE and Hurley.

88
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,381
Two of the top
GPA's in the school.

89
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,927
All I need you to do is handle
the injections and the IV.

90
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:36,765
Forget it, Nelson, I have no interest
in watching you kill yourself.

91
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,601
I think you do.

92
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:44,439
Good morning, class.
Today's exam will be scaled.

93
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:48,109
Three A's will be given,
five B's, 10 C's,

94
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,404
and the remaining four
will get D's and F's.

95
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:59,287
Once again, as in life, you are not in
competition with me, yourself or this exam,

96
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:03,333
but with each other.
Piece of cake.

97
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:08,088
Look, there are a lot of others in this school who'd like to make
a name for themselves off of something like this.

98
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,466
Just seems a shame to me the people
with the ability don't have the nerve.

99
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,053
All right, you want us there,
then we'll be there, Nelson.

100
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,138
Hey, speak for yourself, Joseph.

101
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:21,977
Sure, it'll be dramatic, Nelson.
You'll cry, faint, puke at best.

102
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:26,147
But then what? Because frankly
I don't think you have the balls.

103
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:31,152
You just bring the equipment.
I'll bring my balls.

104
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,530
Did you hear about Labraccio?

105
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:41,162
Dave, it's a four-month suspension. It's
not even gonna affect your scholarship.

106
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,832
Forget it, I'm out of here.

107
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:50,672
You're the best student this school's ever had. They
don't let a guy like you walk away from medicine.

108
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,343
Besides, you were wrong.
No, goddamn it! She was dying.

109
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,722
I saved her life. All right, now
what the hell would you have done?

110
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,599
Why are you taking
this personally?

111
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,851
Of course they're gonna
make an example out of you.

112
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,353
They have to protect
their insurance bond.

113
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,981
They'll ask you back next term.

114
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,484
It doesn't matter. Because given the
same situation, I would do it again.

115
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,069
I know you would.

116
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:17,032
That's exactly why
I need you there tonight.

117
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,367
There are a few people that
I would like to kill right now.

118
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,369
You, however,
are not one of them.

119
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:25,332
Hey. I don't wanna die.

120
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:31,171
I want to come back with
the answers to death and life.

121
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,882
I can get there with the others,

122
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:40,180
but I need you. I need you
to bring me back. Please.

123
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,601
I'm sorry, man, I can't do that.

124
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,356
Great.

125
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:53,568
Why don't you just walk away,
Dave? Go climb a mountain.

126
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,112
You know, I don't even
understand you anymore.

127
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,239
You burned your career
today on a stranger.

128
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:01,910
Now you're turning
your back on a friend.

129
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:17,467
Look, I'm real sorry about what
happened today, okay? I really am.

130
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,054
But what are my chances
of making it back without you?

131
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,766
So don't do it.

132
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,613
Hey, Dave.

133
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:43,451
What if it works?

134
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,257
Hi.

135
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,279
I don't want to be
buried on Saturday.

136
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:24,325
It costs $150 more
to be buried on Saturday.

137
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:29,330
Mrs. Amsler,
you're doing much better.

138
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,377
Leave a message after the beep.

139
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,547
Dr. Hurley, I know you're home.

140
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,300
Don't be late.
Don't forget the camera.

141
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,551
What camera?

142
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,999
Shit.

143
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,546
Ah, the bed. Thank God
he called a specialist.

144
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,298
No lectures, okay, STECKLE?

145
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:46,301
Why should I expect that after you
become engaged, you might grow up?

146
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,761
Did it ever dawn on you that I'm
trying to work some things out?

147
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,472
Recording a few last adventures before
I resign to a life of monogamy.

148
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,516
No, never dawned
on me for a moment.

149
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,978
But the words "pussy marauder"
do pop into mind occasionally.

150
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:04,819
What the hell are we doing here? This is
goodbye, med school. Goodbye, career.

151
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,322
Chill out, Randall.
Ten bucks says he doesn't do it.

152
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,990
He shits his drawers
and we're out of here.

153
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:13,661
Not those lights.
Security will come running.

154
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,665
Set up over the grate.
I just got the boiler going.

155
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:22,003
You're really gonna do this?
Just humor the man.

156
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:26,549
You're gonna take me down with nitrous,
sodium pentothal and a refrigerated blanket.

157
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,344
I've got some chilled D5W
in the cooler.

158
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:35,308
When my body temperature hits 86 degrees,
you're gonna hit me with 200 joules.

159
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:39,687
The electric current will stop my heart.
When the heart is dead, take the mask off.

160
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,522
Where's Mannus? I thought
you said Rachel was coming.

161
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,150
- STECKLE, shut the door.
- Wait a minute.

162
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,862
I'm gonna draw 20 cc's.
You handle the injections.

163
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,698
When the EEG flatlines,
the brain is dead.

164
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,367
I'll be exploring.

165
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:58,373
Give me 30 seconds. Flip the blanket onto
warm and take me up to 93 degrees, slowly.

166
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,711
Inject 1 cc of adrenalin, and at one
minute, Joe, you come in with the defibs.

167
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:08,424
And you bring me back to life.
With brain damage.

168
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:14,222
Resembling in many ways
a Cabbage Patch doll.

169
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:18,685
Not with a body temperature
of 86 degrees.

170
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:25,441
Dr. Mannus, will you
handle the injections?

171
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:34,742
Wait a minute. Wait. Quite
simply, why are you doing this?

172
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,079
Quite simply to see if there is
anything out there beyond death.

173
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,249
Philosophy failed.
Religion failed.

174
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:46,421
Now it's up to the physical sciences.
I think mankind deserves to know.

175
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,090
So you're doing
this for mankind?

176
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:53,886
This letter absolves you of any
responsibility. Just in case.

177
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,264
This isn't for mankind.
This is for Nelson.

178
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,683
Why do I suddenly see
you on 60 Minutes,

179
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,811
sandwiched in between Andy
Rooney and a Subaru commercial.

180
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:06,941
"Tonight, a brilliant young medical student
who dared to experience death and come back."

181
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,694
Fame is inevitable.
That's the wrong reason.

182
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,779
It's the right idea.

183
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:17,702
Dr. Hurley, electrodes. Come on, Joe,
don't you want to be on 60 Minutes?

184
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:27,295
Rachel, how about a little nitrous?
At least I get to go out with a laugh.

185
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:33,801
Dr. Hurley,
get the blanket.

186
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:41,642
We're all professionals.
I'm sure this'll go very smoothly.

187
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,771
Nelson, if you die,
can I have your apartment?

188
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:48,608
- It's a joke. It's a joke!
- One minute.

189
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:53,821
Don't be late.
Start filming now.

190
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:57,200
You'll have a complete record
of the experiment.

191
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:01,829
Promise me you'll
go through with this.

192
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,340
One little kiss goodbye.

193
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:16,344
I'll see you soon.

194
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,063
Ninety-six degrees.

195
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,023
This letter does not mean shit.

196
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:33,444
Oh, please. Let him sleep it off. He'll have
a wet dream and think he went to heaven, okay?

197
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,446
Good idea.
Good night, Nelson.

198
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,073
Now I know why I'm here.

199
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,827
I've expressed myself very clearly
for the record, good night.

200
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:45,873
Steckle's right. Are you willing to risk everything,
med school, your future, for Nelson's fame?

201
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,795
Someone's coming!
Oh, shit.

202
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,885
- Is he dead?
- He's only sleeping.

203
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,722
Thank God you're here to talk
some sense into these people.

204
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,933
I'll do it.
What?

205
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,561
You're taking over?
I've got nothing to lose.

206
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,772
Just his life!
I can get him back.

207
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,276
Just stop his heart.
One minute, bring him right back.

208
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,735
Don't think I couldn't have.

209
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,410
No!

210
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,747
Clear.
What the fuck are you doing?

211
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,125
Asystole.

212
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,586
You're killing him.
It's called murder.

213
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,962
No wonder you got tossed.

214
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,423
This is not the kind of shit
I want on my transcript.

215
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,426
Please don't. Don't do anymore.

216
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:42,263
I did not come to medical school to murder
my classmates, no matter how deranged they might be.

217
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,934
Flatline.

218
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:56,485
They're getting smaller. He's dying.

219
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,655
Brain death.
Now it's real.

220
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,782
Start filming.

221
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:07,121
Let me defib him. He's dead, isn't that
enough? Let me try to bring him back.

222
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,248
Just watch the door.

223
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:13,961
Excuse me, I don't want to ruin anyone's evening,
but are we in the room with a dead man?

224
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:18,132
Oh, my God.
One minute to go.

225
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,301
Start filming!

226
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,468
Thirty seconds to go.

227
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,012
Okay, here we
go, let's heat him up.

228
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,037
Twenty seconds at 89, 90, 91…

229
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,706
Standing by with
sodium bicarb and epi.

230
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,374
Charging the paddles.

231
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,381
Charged.

232
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:47,888
Monitor the EKG.

233
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:55,604
Body temp, 93 degrees.
All right, here we go. Clear!

234
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:04,071
What have we got?
Not a goddamn thing.

235
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:07,491
Up me to 300. Charged.

236
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,037
All clear.

237
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,918
Begin CPR.

238
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:23,090
- Sodium bicarbonate and epi in.
- Bag him. Breathe.

239
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:26,594
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

240
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,728
Look at it.
Not a goddamn thing!

241
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:39,940
Ninety-eight degrees.
Hit him again. 350. Clear!

242
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,446
Nothing. Nothing.

243
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,619
Got him!

244
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,290
- STECKLE, help me.
- Epi. More epi.

245
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,960
In.

246
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,308
REM. We got REM.

247
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:28,322
- Nelson, can you hear us?
- Welcome back, man.

248
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,784
Nelson, you crazy
motherfucker, you did it!

249
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,329
Jesus Christ!

250
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:40,835
STECKLE, that's some bedside manner.
You're gonna make one hell of a doctor.

251
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:44,088
Suck me.

252
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,938
Can you recall any specific emotion
or sensation? Heat, cold, anything like that?

253
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,733
You can't break it
down into specifics.

254
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,027
They say they see a
tunnel of light at the end.

255
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:53,782
No. No, but there is something
out there. It's comforting.

256
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,076
Do you have any idea how big
this is? Can you even imagine?

257
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,411
You walked
on the moon, buddy.

258
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:01,957
Okay, okay, he could use some air. I think
you guys could get him some fluids.

259
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,419
- Thanks for saving my life.
- Lt was so much fun.

260
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,421
Let's get that
blood pressure going.

261
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,550
Are you all right, wise one?

262
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:15,262
Dave, I feel like a
highly tuned instrument.

263
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:19,266
Can you hear the traffic
on the lake shore?

264
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,101
Uh-huh.

265
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:25,481
Underneath that there's a hum.

266
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,775
It's the streetlights.

267
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,443
All right.

268
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:35,950
Even fainter I can hear
a kind of dragging sound.

269
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:41,330
And it's getting louder.
No.

270
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:46,460
I not only hear it,
I can feel it.

271
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:53,634
Yeah, well, your prognosis is excellent.
You'll look great on 60 Minutes.

272
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,302
It's bigger than that, David.

273
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,638
By the time you're through
with it, I'm sure it will be.

274
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:05,354
You're not buying any of this.
You forgot, I'm an atheist.

275
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:10,526
Are you all right for a few minutes?
Yeah.

276
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,661
How's he doing?
Well, physically he's stable.

277
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,622
He's talking like Lazarus
back from the dead.

278
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,667
That's what we did, right? We
brought him back from the dead.

279
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,335
All we did was get lucky.

280
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,170
I would like to go next.
Forget it.

281
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,214
Me too. Seriously.

282
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,341
Why shouldn't we all
get famous from this?

283
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,968
That's not what
this is about, Joe.

284
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,846
Yeah, Hurley, you're gonna be famous.
They're gonna build monuments to you.

285
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,640
Little stone ones,
about this high. "Rest in Peace."

286
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,350
Like it or not, I'm going next.

287
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:46,020
I'd be willing to go
one minute 20 seconds.

288
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,692
One thirty.

289
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,901
Are you two crazy?

290
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:57,573
Or are you just so tragically competitive that you
would enter into a bidding war with your lives?

291
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,159
One thirty.

292
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:07,374
That's it then. Not a bad price
to pay for fame and glory.

293
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:11,378
Die to be a hero,
but don't die to be a celebrity.

294
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,771
Champ?

295
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,491
I think someone ought
to stay with him tonight.

296
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,201
I have class in three hours.

297
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,786
I will.

298
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,956
All right. Are you okay?

299
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:32,751
I'd like to go home.

300
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:15,669
Are you okay?
You were hyperventilating.

301
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,216
Your can expect your
blood pressure to rise.

302
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:25,804
Cardiovascular vessels will constrict,
increasing your blood supply.

303
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:32,394
God, you're beautiful.
Get some rest.

304
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,146
Hey.

305
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:41,320
I bet 24 hours ago you didn't think
you'd be spending the night here.

306
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,700
You were lucky last night,
Nelson. Don't push it.

307
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:02,257
So I want to wish you two
the best of everything together.

308
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,222
I know you'll be healthy and wealthy
and happy together in your wealth.

309
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:16,355
Hello, may I please
speak to Anne Coldren?

310
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,693
Hello?
Anne?

311
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:26,740
Hi, I have been thinking
about you all day. How are you?

312
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,909
Counting the days
to Thanksgiving break.

313
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:35,415
Me too. You know, I've got to transfer to a
school closer to you or get a faster car.

314
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,418
Sometimes I wonder, maybe we should've
gotten married last summer.

315
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,587
My mother wasn't ready yet.

316
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,090
You know, honey,
you're the best.

317
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,761
And if anything should
ever happen…

318
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:52,891
Joe, what's wrong?
I don't know. I'm just tired.

319
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:57,271
I'm not making any sense.
Look, honey, I should go.

320
00:30:57,438 --> 00:31:02,484
Joe, you're scaring me.
It's okay, nothing's wrong.

321
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:05,946
I love you. Bye.

322
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,110
It's a boy.

323
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,868
- Nothing.
- Starting CPR.

324
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,370
One, 1000.
Two, 1000.

325
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,413
Three, 1000.
Four, 1000.

326
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,875
CPR and adrenalin, and nothing!

327
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,419
One forty-five.
What's going on? Come on, Joe!

328
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,923
Come on, Nelson, let me try.
Five, 1000.

329
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,217
Nothing.
We're running out of time!

330
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,885
Two, 1000.
Three, 1000.

331
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,388
Come on, Nelson, let me try.
I'm doing everything I fucking can!

332
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,931
Breathe.
Let him try.

333
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:59,893
Nelson, step back.
Come on, Joe!

334
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:05,065
One, 1000, two, 1000, three, 1000,
four, 1000, five. 1000. Breathe!

335
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:50,485
I got him. O2.

336
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,031
O2 up.

337
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:02,164
CPR successful. Hurley lives.

338
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,959
It's okay, Joe.

339
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,134
It was great.
Here it comes.

340
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,802
Why don't you
just let him talk, Dave?

341
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,138
Define "great."

342
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:23,769
I don't know, it's not thinking
about the past or the future.

343
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:27,064
It's difficult to explain.
Maybe impossible.

344
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,816
Yeah, dying is funny that way.

345
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:34,029
Dave, Nelson's right, there
definitely is activity beyond death.

346
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:38,492
- Absolutely.
- The experience was strange.

347
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:43,497
It was almost erotic.
He's dead and he gets laid.

348
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,958
Wait a sec.
What do you mean, erotic?

349
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:51,171
I don't want you to think it was
casually, wantonly sexual by any means.

350
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,549
No, that never would have occurred
to me in a million years, no way.

351
00:34:54,759 --> 00:35:00,514
It was friendly. Lt was something
vaguely feminine guiding me.

352
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:05,519
This could be the conquest of our
generation. The last great frontier.

353
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:10,857
First you had the sea, then
America, the West, the Moon,

354
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,485
Mr. Leary, drugs,
the inner journey,

355
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:17,072
Ms. MacLaine, and our illustrious
former First Lady, the outer journey.

356
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:20,325
But this, this is ours!
Well, we did have disco.

357
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:24,329
We have finally found something worthwhile,
something to upstage those fucking baby boomers.

358
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,248
Watch your mouths.

359
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:30,043
I found something.
Okay, let's not forget that.

360
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,379
I came back from
the dead tonight.

361
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:36,007
It doesn't surprise me. We had
Elvis in here last night.

362
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,098
Pay when you're ready, okay?

363
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,269
Joe, did you find it difficult
at the end, getting back?

364
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,188
No, not that I remember.

365
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:54,860
But you remember everything else?
I think you guys are full of shit.

366
00:35:56,571 --> 00:36:02,576
I'm not buying any of this.
I probably wouldn't buy it either,

367
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:06,538
unless I'd been there.
So, what about it, Dave?

368
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:10,584
Yeah, you're an atheist.
You got nothing to lose, right?

369
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,752
I'm going next.

370
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:19,050
Nobody's going next. You're looking
for answers? There's no answers here.

371
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:22,721
I think you just saw what
you wanted to see.

372
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,891
Give it up. It's too dangerous.
Who the hell are you to…?

373
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:31,771
We can't turn back now.
I'm going further. One fifty.

374
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,275
Two minutes.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you just said…

375
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,611
I changed my mind.
Two minutes.

376
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,780
Two ten.
Two twenty.

377
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,911
Well, looks like
we found a winner.

378
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:55,795
Enjoying yourself, Nelson?

379
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,975
Joe…

380
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:14,814
was there anything negative about your
experience? Anything negative at all?

381
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:18,526
No. Nothing.

382
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,491
Good. Good.

383
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:30,372
Hey. Hey! Hold on.
Was that your idea of chivalry?

384
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,873
No, absolutely not.

385
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:37,003
Were you trying to show me up?
Not everything is about you.

386
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:42,217
Nobody seems to want me to go under.
I don't need your protection.

387
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,512
Well, there seems to be a lot of speculation
about what you do need, Mannus.

388
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,641
Oh, does there? And what did you
decide in your infinite wisdom?

389
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:56,815
I decided that when someone is as smart
and driven as you are, and incredibly beautiful,

390
00:37:56,983 --> 00:38:00,568
it makes the rest of us
very nervous.

391
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,655
Why did you change your mind?

392
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:08,076
Because I'm the skeptic, I'm the control
in this experiment. I should go next.

393
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,162
If there's nothing out there, then I am
not gonna convince myself that there is,

394
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:15,000
and then there's no reason
for us to go any further.

395
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:19,045
Okay, but how do you explain the similarity
in death experiences all over the world?

396
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:24,009
People from different cultures and religions
all seeing the same things in the same order.

397
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:27,721
I don't know. Maybe there's some chemical
or a hormone released from the brain

398
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,682
at the time of death that makes
it more palatable to us.

399
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,851
No, you're reaching.

400
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,730
What if you go and there is
something out there?

401
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:41,151
Well, then you can kill yourself
for as long as you want.

402
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,028
I'm not going to kill myself.

403
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:46,239
I'm glad to hear that, Mannus. I really
haven't known you for very long,

404
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:49,743
but I get the feeling
like I might miss you.

405
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:56,416
So why this obsession with death?
It's not an obsession. It's an interest.

406
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,668
It's a personal interest.

407
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,796
Okay.
Good night.

408
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:06,760
Can I drive you home?
No, thanks.

409
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,494
I didn't take the money.

410
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:18,832
I got the toaster, but too many
appliances make you lonely.

411
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,000
Right, Nelson?

412
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:25,672
Because in the end,
we all know what we've done.

413
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:55,702
Champ?

414
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,461
Champ!

415
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:35,700
Champ?

416
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:41,372
Come on, boy.
Come here, Champ.

417
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:45,418
Come here, boy.
Come on, Champ.

418
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,345
What are you doing here, kid?
Are you all right?

419
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:59,766
Hey. You okay?

420
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,018
What are you doing here?
Are you lost?

421
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:28,461
Halloween morning.
Rotting pumpkins, burning leaves,

422
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:32,215
black cats
mating like rats in the alley.

423
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:37,178
It was…
It were as if we felt no fear.

424
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:42,892
As if we were already dead,
and had nothing to lose by dying.

425
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:49,607
Or perhaps it was because we lived
life so well, and loved life so much,

426
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,402
that we imagined
ourselves immortal.

427
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:58,408
Overwhelming the powers that be with
the force of our passion for science.

428
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,369
Or maybe we were
just fucked in the head.

429
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,833
Hey, I'm Joe Hurley.
You're Terry, right?

430
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,167
Uh-huh.

431
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:11,963
Listen, I heard you had
a near-death experience.

432
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,965
I don't want to talk about it.

433
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:20,346
Hey. Wait a minute. I had
a near-death experience also.

434
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:24,851
You did?
Yes, and I need someone to talk to.

435
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,771
Terry, this thing
changed my life.

436
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,983
First of all, they didn't
even believe me.

437
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,777
What the hell do they know?
We were there, right?

438
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:38,656
I want you to tell me all about it.
But if you've gotta go to class,

439
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:42,285
maybe we can get together some
night this week and discuss it?

440
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,246
You know, all that day I knew
something was going to happen.

441
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:52,503
I've always had premonitions. Once, my aunt
was supposed to fly in from Las Vegas…

442
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:04,223
Why did you do this to me, Joe?

443
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,309
Shit.

444
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,021
No!

445
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:38,776
Trick or treat.

446
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:24,155
I don't know, you guys.
It's Halloween. There's a full moon.

447
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,365
Don't you think we might be
pushing it just a little bit?

448
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,660
Sorry I'm late.

449
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,245
What the hell
happened to your face?

450
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,998
Some guys, some very
big guys. Lt doesn't matter.

451
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,292
Let me take a look at it.
I'm fine.

452
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,963
Where the hell have you been?

453
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:44,425
I don't feel very well.
What the hell happened to you?

454
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:48,221
Enough.
Worry about your camera.

455
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:49,889
Nice outfit.

456
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:55,394
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

457
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:00,358
Who are you supposed
to be? Boner Man?

458
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,693
Two twenty, don't forget.

459
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:06,239
You just hurry up and get back.

460
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:09,492
- You can buy us breakfast.
- Hey, Nelson.

461
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,494
Don't let go of the rope.

462
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,249
Hoka hey.

463
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:21,254
See you soon.

464
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:33,349
Twenty cc's sodium pentothal in.

465
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:36,811
Eighty-six degrees.

466
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,730
Two hundred joules charged.

467
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,610
Clear.

468
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,284
Flatline.

469
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:46,172
What hangs in the air palpably?
Is it hope, is it fear?

470
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,965
Is it the musky mist of death?

471
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:51,344
Shut up, STECKLE.
No, you shut up!

472
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,515
What if he didn't make it back?

473
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,853
Would you miss him, Rachel?

474
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,942
One minute.

475
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:26,212
Ninety degrees.
Give him another five seconds.

476
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,881
What?
Ten. Why not 10?

477
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,841
We've got a little time
to decide.

478
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,635
Are you serious?

479
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:36,806
Joey. I trusted you, Joe.

480
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:39,809
Stations. Joe, you're
blocking our view.

481
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,978
Come on, guys,
no kidding around here.

482
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:45,147
Who's kidding?

483
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:50,486
What the hell's going on here?
Ninety-two degrees.

484
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,739
Joe, get it!

485
00:49:54,491 --> 00:50:00,788
Come on,
18…

486
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,999
Two-twenty. Hand it over.

487
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,712
This is my lab.
Three hundred joules.

488
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,632
Charged.

489
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,426
Clear.

490
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,483
Breathe!
Sodium bicarb and epi in.

491
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:32,445
One, 1000, two, 1000.
What comes next?

492
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,114
Knock it off, Nelson!

493
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,491
Five, 1000. Breathe.

494
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:41,704
Three hundred
joules charged. Clear.

495
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:45,374
Come on, Dave.

496
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,303
That's it, that's it!

497
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,346
That's not it. He's stuck in v-fib!
Charging again, 300.

498
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:01,140
- You're hot.
- Try Lidocaine.

499
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:04,894
- At 2:45, atropine.
- Not yet, STECKLE. Clear.

500
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,353
Come on, Dave.
Come on.

501
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:10,066
Increasing to 360.
Charge. Clear.

502
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,735
- Go to Lidocaine.
- He won't hold the beat.

503
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:13,986
Three fucking minutes.

504
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:17,740
Starting CPR. One, 1000.
Atropine in.

505
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:21,494
Joe, keep filming. I'm gonna bring
him back. Five, 1000. Breathe.

506
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:22,995
You lied to me, Joe.

507
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,041
- We lost him.
- Lidocaine push.

508
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,001
Somebody do something.

509
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,670
Three sixty, charged. Clear.

510
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,468
- Got him!
- O2 standing by.

511
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,553
One mg epi in.

512
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:42,098
That sounds good.
That was close, boy.

513
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:47,520
Oh, my God, that was close. That was way
too close. Okay? That was too close.

514
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,357
Hoka hey.
What did you say there?

515
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:57,029
Hoka hey. It's the war cry of the
Sioux Indians. Very macho. Lt means…

516
00:51:57,197 --> 00:52:03,119
"Today is a good day to die." So was
it, Dave? Was today a good day to die?

517
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:07,957
I don't know if I was dead.
I may have felt something.

518
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:12,378
Like a dream or just a bunch of stuff
stored up inside my mind.

519
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,631
You were brain-dead.
There was no mind.

520
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:19,718
Yeah, but some electrical current
still circulating through my body…

521
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:26,058
Lt would've shown up on the EEG. You were dead.
So why don't you just tell us what happened?

522
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:32,398
Well, it's hard to verbalize.

523
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:36,485
It's like being paranoid
without the fear.

524
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:40,990
Like being watched. But that was probably
just you guys were standing over me.

525
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:44,243
Who could be watching?
The dead.

526
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:45,744
I didn't say that.

527
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:50,082
But the skeptic did feel
something. I'm going again.

528
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,251
No way, Nelson!
I've been bumped twice.

529
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,336
- Bidding starts at four minutes.
- Four minutes?

530
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,422
Yeah. Labraccio went for 3:50.

531
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,175
That was a mistake.
We almost lost him.

532
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,552
Anything under four minutes
would be redundant.

533
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,180
No one is going
for four minutes!

534
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:08,225
Four twenty-five.
Five minutes.

535
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:10,102
I'm next or I'm out for good.

536
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:13,647
Without her help, five
minutes is gonna be hard enough.

537
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:16,817
But without me…
Or me.

538
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:19,278
Count me out too, Nelson.

539
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:26,577
Well, mutiny at last.

540
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:36,003
I trusted you, all of you, with an idea that was so
simple and brilliant. You get one in a lifetime.

541
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,589
Give it a rest, Nelson.
No, you give it a rest!

542
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:42,259
None of you had the foresight or the
balls to do any of this until I did it.

543
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:45,262
Rachel, you want to go next?
Be my guest.

544
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:49,391
Fuck the rest of you.
This was my idea.

545
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,644
You're just tourists.

546
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:59,735
Hey, I would've gone
3:30 or 3:40. I still might.

547
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:05,741
But, Joe, 4:25 is crazy. We're pushing the
five-minute mark here. It's dangerous.

548
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,622
You shit, Joe.

549
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:15,167
You said you loved me, Joe.

550
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:21,715
- I love you, Joe.
- Yoo-hoo. Buddy?

551
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:26,762
Skeletor, are you listening to me?

552
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,335
Thanks for staying.

553
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:44,715
I'm on the early shift.
You seem fine. I'll see you later.

554
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:45,924
Wait, wait, wait.

555
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:49,511
About tonight…
Don't try to talk me out of it.

556
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,889
Why are you doing this?

557
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:57,436
Look, I've lost people
that are close to me.

558
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:02,900
I just want to make sure they've gone to
a good place. Does that seem trivial?

559
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:06,945
To tell you the truth, it's the best
reason I've heard yet for going.

560
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:12,284
But, listen, there's something
I didn't tell you about last night.

561
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:17,873
I had this feeling that
if I had gone any further,

562
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:22,169
that there was something
out there protecting me.

563
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:26,173
You know, something good.

564
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:33,138
So you don't need to go under.
The atheist now believes in God?

565
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:39,061
I'm trying to tell you that
I don't want you to do it.

566
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:45,984
Think about all we'll have to talk
about when you bring me back.

567
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:54,243
I'm dying. Don't lie to me.

568
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:59,915
Mrs. Amsler,
you've put up a great fight.

569
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:05,587
Sometimes we just have to let go.
That's what the voices say.

570
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,507
What voices?

571
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:11,802
They say,
"Have you done enough?"

572
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:15,222
"Have you told everyone
you love them?"

573
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,809
I have. I have.

574
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,936
It's okay.

575
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:26,525
They're friendly voices. They're
telling you what you need to know.

576
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:32,072
What?
That you have someplace to go.

577
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:38,120
Do you believe that?
Yes, I do.

578
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:46,628
Yes, I do.

579
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:34,009
Hey! Hey, fellatio!

580
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:40,474
Got a match? Well, I do.

581
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:43,685
Your face and my ass.

582
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,355
Your breath and a buffalo fart.

583
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,814
Do I know you?

584
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:52,611
You don't know jack shit!
Butt-wad, needle-dick, cock-bite,

585
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,405
jack-off, limp-wrist,
corn-hole,

586
00:58:55,573 --> 00:59:01,119
banana-breath, shit-bird,
bird-turd, turd-face,

587
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:05,582
kiss-ass, brown-nose, macho-wimp,
limp-dick, fart-face, turd-merchant!

588
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:11,004
What's the matter? Gonna cry?
Cry-baby Davie. Cry, cry, cry!

589
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:14,424
Shit-faced, rat-turd,
ass-licking son of a bitch.

590
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:38,448
How did it happen?
I was playing hockey.

591
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:41,118
Look, about last night…
It's okay.

592
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:45,205
No-show Labraccio.
This really isn't like him.

593
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:48,166
It's his way of trying to stop me.
It won't work, I'm ready.

594
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:51,044
It's not a good idea
to do this without David.

595
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:55,340
We don't need Dave.
Can you do this?

596
00:59:55,508 --> 01:00:01,597
Can you trust me?
No, but let's do it anyway.

597
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:04,766
Nitrous on.

598
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,646
See you soon.

599
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,123
How long's she been under?
One-twenty.

600
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,458
We're bringing her back.
No, we're not.

601
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,959
Get that blanket to warm.
Body temp?

602
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:33,670
She hasn't been under long enough.
Just do it, Joe.

603
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:37,299
Joe, we said 4:25
Just do it!

604
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,427
Don't expect any hugs
and kisses for this.

605
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:27,891
Waiting for body temp to rise.
Aborting fourth experiment. Why, Dave?

606
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:31,478
- Why don't you ask Dr. Death?
- Ninety degrees.

607
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:33,814
What's going on, Nelson?
Nothing.

608
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:35,982
Just bringing Rachel
back early, that's all.

609
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:39,111
That's all, huh?
Don't start now. Think about Rachel.

610
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:42,155
Joe's right. Ninety-one
degrees. Let's be ready.

611
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:21,737
Rachel, don't go in there.

612
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:25,782
I told you not to do that.

613
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,744
Denny!

614
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,496
It's your fault!

615
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:40,380
- Nothing.
- Take me up to 300.

616
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,257
Three hundred? You're hot.

617
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,801
- Come on, Rachel.
- No, not a thing. 2:05.

618
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,386
- You're hot.
- Clear.

619
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:48,221
- Come on, Rachel. Come on!
- Shit!

620
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:07,032
Oh, no! Denny!

621
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:10,619
Three hundred joules. Clear!

622
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,204
- Got her!
- V-fib.

623
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:13,622
We don't have her.

624
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:17,417
It's okay, we'll get her.
Step me up to 360. Clear.

625
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:22,380
What the hell is going on? What
did you do to me? I had her.

626
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:24,758
Fuse. A short,
maybe a circuit.

627
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:28,053
Joe, you charged the battery?
Shit!

628
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:31,556
Oh, shit.
Starting CPR. Bag her, STECKLE.

629
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:39,564
- No pulse.
- Epi in.

630
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:06,925
It's not working. Joe, take over.
Got her.

631
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,718
Four minutes. She's been
under four minutes.

632
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:14,933
- We're moving to bretylium.
- No.

633
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,768
It's the only way.
No!

634
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,520
It's our last chance.

635
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:22,065
Don't do it, you'll fry her.

636
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:27,946
Nelson!

637
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:32,200
Please, don't!

638
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:39,958
You'll bring her back?

639
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:47,632
Come on, Mannus.
You can do it.

640
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,304
Lidocaine in.

641
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:56,391
Come on back to us.
Come on.

642
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:02,731
Wait! Shh, shh, shh!
I got something.

643
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:07,819
I hear something.

644
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:11,615
O2! O2!

645
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:19,581
She's back.

646
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:31,635
I still don't understand
why you stopped us.

647
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:33,929
Something happened to me today.
Something very strange.

648
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,430
That's why you stopped us?

649
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,891
There was this girl.
Winnie Hicks, I think it was.

650
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,726
I was in elementary
school with her.

651
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:42,854
We used to make fun of her.

652
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:45,190
I was on the train, and I heard
someone calling me names.

653
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:49,277
I turned around, I swear to God,
she was standing right in front of me!

654
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,947
Still only 10 years old.
Maybe it was a hallucination.

655
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:54,908
Maybe you fell asleep. Thoughts
triggered by submerged guilt.

656
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:56,201
No, I was not asleep.

657
01:05:56,369 --> 01:06:00,288
Guys, I've seen some
odd things from my past too.

658
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,916
I thought it was brain damage.
In your case it probably is.

659
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:04,459
I'm gonna get
some of this on tape.

660
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,044
STECKLE, shut that off,
this is personal.

661
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,712
Go ahead, Joe.

662
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:12,550
I've been haunted by images of women
that I videotaped without them knowing.

663
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:15,887
They're all members of the
Joe Hurley Video Library.

664
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,014
What?

665
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:22,394
What about you, Nelson?
Who's come looking for you?

666
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:28,316
His name's Billy Mahoney.
He's a kid we picked on in school.

667
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,860
It's no big deal.
No big deal, huh?

668
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:33,238
Then what happened to your face?

669
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:35,907
Sometimes the little fella
gets carried away.

670
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:37,993
Wait a minute.
Wait.

671
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:43,581
I can understand Dave nodding off on the train,
and pervert here having a couple of flashbacks.

672
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,333
You're saying this guy
physically touches you?

673
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:47,877
That is not a hallucination
and it is not possible!

674
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:50,588
This whole lab's not
possible! Or is it?

675
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:54,592
This is too weird.
Weird? We've experienced death.

676
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,638
Now somehow we've brought our sins
back physically. And they're pissed.

677
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:03,768
When did you know about this?
I had my suspicions after Joe went.

678
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:06,521
Before I went. Before she went.
And you didn't say a word!

679
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:10,191
That's wrong, Nelson.
Jesus Christ! We're scientists.

680
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:15,780
Call yourself a scientist? It's reckless, immoral
and unethical for you to withhold your findings.

681
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:19,909
Rachel Mannus may have
the answers to life and death.

682
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:23,705
She was under for five minutes!

683
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:28,084
Now, if she walks out of that
ladies' room with those answers…

684
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:32,172
the whole world
will worship her.

685
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:38,511
Just like you do.
You should've told us, Nelson.

686
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:43,558
You wouldn't have done it.
At least we would've had a choice!

687
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,150
We're fucked.

688
01:07:54,945 --> 01:08:00,408
Rachel, are you all right?
I'm okay. I'm okay.

689
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:11,503
I said I was fine.

690
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:16,424
Are you guys gonna watch me?

691
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:33,835
Come on, Billy Mahoney.
Come on.

692
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:37,005
Give it your best shot.

693
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:43,636
I dare you. I fucking dare you.

694
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:47,891
Things from our past,
they want revenge?

695
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:51,603
I don't know. I'm not
exactly sure how it works.

696
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:57,233
But if you see anything, I want you to talk
to me about it. All right? Whatever it is.

697
01:09:57,401 --> 01:10:00,278
You just tell the doctor.

698
01:10:02,823 --> 01:10:04,782
I'll be in the living room
if you need anything.

699
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:09,454
Is it people who we've hurt
or wronged in some way?

700
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:13,291
Did something happen tonight? Ls there
something you want to talk to me about?

701
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:16,461
No.

702
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:20,089
Just try to get some rest.

703
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:27,972
How's she doing?
I think she's hiding something.

704
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,141
Like what? Ls there any
heebie-jeebie stuff going on?

705
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:31,768
What do you think
Nelson did to that kid?

706
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:34,395
How the hell am I
supposed to know?

707
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:37,649
It's really important
that we keep each other informed.

708
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,734
Yeah, I'm sorry.

709
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,736
Why don't you guys
take off? I'll stay with her.

710
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,529
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm sorry.

711
01:10:43,697 --> 01:10:45,156
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

712
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,196
We're gonna get you,
Billy Mahoney!

713
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:31,452
No! Sorry! No! No! No!

714
01:11:32,746 --> 01:11:35,373
No, stop! Stop, Nelson!

715
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:39,919
No!

716
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:10,033
How are you doing?
I'm late. I'll see you later.

717
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,909
Wait. Where are you going?

718
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:14,329
I'm late. I have to talk to her.
I've gotta stop her.

719
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,372
Talk to who?

720
01:12:16,623 --> 01:12:19,334
Good morning, Rachel.

721
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:23,671
No, no. No, no.

722
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:29,469
I wanted to tell her the voices were wrong.
There's nothing beautiful out there.

723
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:32,764
Rachel, you gotta get used to
losing them. It's part of our work.

724
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:35,725
But I was wrong.

725
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:45,253
You look like
you're enjoying the day.

726
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:47,088
Yeah, right.

727
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:52,760
Don't you remember me, Joe?
Yes, of course.

728
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:59,100
Are you a model? You could be.
Look, I've got to go.

729
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:03,729
I'm not picking you up.
I just picked you out.

730
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:07,108
Mind if I buy you a drink?
No, thanks.

731
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:10,319
I'll call you this weekend.
I've been looking for a study partner.

732
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:11,946
Fine, I'm in the book.

733
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:20,371
Hey, gorgeous.
Who are you?

734
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:22,290
What are you doing?

735
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:25,710
Some crazy girl…
I know you, don't I?

736
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:30,506
Would you like to?
We don't have to do anything.

737
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:35,052
We can just lie together.
Hold each other in our underwear.

738
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:44,645
I'll call you. I promise.

739
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:48,858
I'm tired of playing the field.

740
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:52,445
We can stop whenever you want.

741
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:57,325
It'll only make our
relationship better.

742
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:02,371
I've never felt like this before.

743
01:15:02,539 --> 01:15:05,082
I'm tired of playing the field.

744
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:07,210
Of course I respect you.

745
01:15:07,377 --> 01:15:08,961
We can stop whenever you want.

746
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:11,964
Joe.

747
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:14,091
Joey.

748
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:15,676
Mmm, Joseph.

749
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:17,470
Carl.
… whenever you want.

750
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:21,098
I need you to show me
that you love me.

751
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:24,685
You're not real!

752
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:32,527
Anne, is that you?

753
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:40,785
Is it really you?
You sounded so upset on the phone.

754
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:46,249
I was worried. I took the bus down.
What a great surprise.

755
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:52,296
How long have you been here?
Long enough to see your tapes.

756
01:15:53,757 --> 01:15:57,009
Oh, my God!

757
01:15:57,177 --> 01:16:03,391
You know, the worst part is, you're gonna think I'm
leaving you because you slept with those girls.

758
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:06,394
They meant nothing to me.

759
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:12,024
I wish they had meant something. If you were
honest, if you had cared for any of them,

760
01:16:12,192 --> 01:16:14,986
then I could have
fought that. I loved you.

761
01:16:15,153 --> 01:16:19,490
But to film all those girls without them
knowing it, to have so little respect…

762
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:22,201
Those women trusted you. What
kind of marriage can we have

763
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:24,453
when you have no
understanding of trust.

764
01:16:24,621 --> 01:16:26,539
Anne, please.

765
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:32,628
It's not what you think.
Yes, it is.

766
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:37,300
Hello, is this Mrs. Earl R. Hicks?

767
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:42,346
This is a strange question. Do you have
a daughter Winnie, about 26 years old?

768
01:16:42,514 --> 01:16:48,269
You do? I'm David Labraccio.
I was in school with Winnie.

769
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:51,772
Yeah, my parents
still live there.

770
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:56,193
I wanted to get in touch with her
and I was wondering…

771
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:59,196
Right.

772
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:03,868
Okay. And do you have
an address for her?

773
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:08,497
Great. I really
appreciate it. Bye-bye.

774
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:21,093
Jesus!
It looks as bad as it feels, huh?

775
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:26,307
You want me to take a look at it?
No. How's Rachel doing?

776
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:29,727
She didn't come out of that bathroom
with the answers to life and death.

777
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:31,270
I gotta go.

778
01:17:31,438 --> 01:17:34,649
Where are you going?
Bensenville.

779
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:36,317
Can I go?

780
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,069
It's a two-hour drive.

781
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:43,783
Look, I don't want to be alone.

782
01:17:44,701 --> 01:17:51,248
Today, we are going to remove the left
kidney and dissect the lower intestines.

783
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:57,880
I would like you to remove the ascending
colon from the transverse colon.

784
01:17:58,048 --> 01:18:02,718
Proceed to the sigmoid colon
and on to the appendix.

785
01:18:02,886 --> 01:18:05,971
Remove the appendix,
taking note of the blood supply.

786
01:18:06,139 --> 01:18:10,768
Where the hell are you going?
Are you okay?

787
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:14,522
I would be fine if everyone would
stop asking me if I'm all right.

788
01:18:20,445 --> 01:18:22,029
- Are you crazy?
- Yes!

789
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:24,657
Is she getting the heebie-jeebies?
I'm the one who's spooking.

790
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:29,036
Getting us kicked out of med school won't
get Anne back. Now you get to work.

791
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:22,631
Mannus! Mannus!

792
01:19:22,799 --> 01:19:28,012
I'll handle this. Back to work
or suffer the consequences.

793
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:31,307
Fuck it.

794
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:43,944
- This must be it.
- Winnie did well for herself.

795
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:47,448
She's probably not even
gonna remember who you are.

796
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:49,450
It's worth a shot.

797
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:52,953
Are you coming?
No.

798
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:59,585
Listen, if anything happens…
If you need me, just honk the horn.

799
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:01,295
Okay.

800
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:31,575
Ring, ring, ring. Dave,
you should've sent a letter.

801
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:36,205
Hello?
Anybody home?

802
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:47,091
- Hi, is your mother at home?
- Coming.

803
01:20:49,427 --> 01:20:52,346
Go in the house, baby.

804
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:59,353
Yes? Can I help you?
Yeah, I think you can.

805
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:03,065
You're Winnie Hicks,
aren't you? From Claremont?

806
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:04,275
Yes.

807
01:21:04,609 --> 01:21:09,363
Yeah, I'm David Labraccio.
We went to S. B. Butler together.

808
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:10,573
Really?

809
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:13,117
I was a little smaller then.

810
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:19,623
I just drove up from the city.
That's my truck there.

811
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,959
Hi.

812
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:25,546
Hello, I'm nice. He's nice.

813
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:30,134
We're both fucking lunatics.
Can I come in, please?

814
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:31,844
Thanks a lot.

815
01:21:33,471 --> 01:21:38,601
I've got to hand it to you,
Dave, you've got guts.

816
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:20,643
Wow, this is great.
It's beautiful.

817
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:23,479
Looks like you've done
well for yourself.

818
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:27,399
Well, it isn't medical school.

819
01:22:27,567 --> 01:22:31,487
But I never liked school anyway.

820
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:34,073
I wasn't very good at it.

821
01:22:35,408 --> 01:22:37,159
I'm surprised you even
remember me.

822
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:39,954
Oh, yeah, I do remember you.

823
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:44,083
I also remember the way
we treated you back then.

824
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:47,544
You were a little shy, and I
was a real jerk and I'm sorry.

825
01:22:47,712 --> 01:22:50,923
I mean, I just…
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

826
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:53,759
What are you talking about?

827
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:58,305
That was so long ago I don't even
remember what you could have done.

828
01:22:58,473 --> 01:23:01,558
Let's not dredge up all that stuff.
Sherry, go on in the house.

829
01:23:01,726 --> 01:23:06,230
However we made you feel,
it was wrong.

830
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,899
I mean, we were wrong.

831
01:23:11,277 --> 01:23:13,988
Go on.

832
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:21,704
I have a family now.

833
01:23:22,789 --> 01:23:26,333
I haven't been that ugly
little girl in quite some time.

834
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:30,671
You were never ugly.

835
01:23:31,881 --> 01:23:35,300
Why did you come here?

836
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:14,214
David, help!

837
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:20,095
It was just kids. I know how
kids are. Lt didn't mean anything.

838
01:24:20,263 --> 01:24:23,974
Listen, I didn't mean
to come here…

839
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:27,519
Winnie, are you all right?

840
01:24:27,687 --> 01:24:29,980
I'm fine, Ben.
Everything's okay.

841
01:24:30,774 --> 01:24:32,232
Okay.

842
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:44,578
I'm sorry if I made you feel bad.
I didn't want to hurt you again.

843
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,333
I'm gonna go.

844
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:55,297
David?

845
01:24:57,425 --> 01:24:59,426
Thank you.

846
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:03,972
Are you sure?

847
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:08,477
Thanks.

848
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:18,070
Oh, shit!

849
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:24,284
David! David, help! David!

850
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:27,204
Shit.

851
01:25:27,997 --> 01:25:29,164
No!

852
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:48,892
No!

853
01:26:02,907 --> 01:26:04,491
Nelson!

854
01:26:07,745 --> 01:26:09,329
Jesus.

855
01:26:10,748 --> 01:26:12,791
Nelson!

856
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:22,759
Nelson, stop. Stop, man!
Nelson, stop!

857
01:26:22,927 --> 01:26:25,721
Stop! Stop it!

858
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:27,973
Where's Billy Mahoney?
Where is he?

859
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:32,853
There is no Billy. There's no one here, man.
It's just the two of us. We're all alone.

860
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:35,439
Let go!

861
01:27:04,969 --> 01:27:07,721
Where the hell
have you guys been?

862
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:13,477
She freaked in class.
We've been with her all day.

863
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:14,978
How are you doing?

864
01:27:15,146 --> 01:27:20,275
I'm fine. Fine, for somebody
who keeps running into her father

865
01:27:20,443 --> 01:27:22,778
who's been dead for 20 years.

866
01:27:23,821 --> 01:27:28,242
"Death is beautiful."
What a bunch of crap.

867
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:35,249
How you doing,
Nelson? You okay?

868
01:27:37,543 --> 01:27:40,754
I'd like to thank you
for the nightmare.

869
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:47,261
Hey, you guys were all so eager to jump
on my coattails. Well, welcome aboard.

870
01:27:47,428 --> 01:27:49,763
You withheld information.
That's the same as lying.

871
01:27:50,014 --> 01:27:52,474
Oh. I'm sorry you're so upset.

872
01:27:52,642 --> 01:27:55,269
You think you're the only one that
risked or lost a goddamn thing here?

873
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:57,813
I always felt there was something
profoundly unnatural about this.

874
01:27:57,981 --> 01:28:00,983
Shut up, STECKLE. Talk about somebody
who hasn't risked a goddamn thing.

875
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:02,192
Screw yourself.

876
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:04,528
This is not gonna help!
Kiss my ass.

877
01:28:04,696 --> 01:28:07,155
We're all in this together.
No, we're not.

878
01:28:07,323 --> 01:28:09,199
Wait a minute.
Isn't she strong?

879
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:11,034
So independent.

880
01:28:11,202 --> 01:28:14,621
When I get into trouble, I don't
drag everybody down with me.

881
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:20,294
Drag every…? Come on! What happened to you?
You got caught with your videotapes down?

882
01:28:20,461 --> 01:28:24,298
You swore at a little girl
on a playground. Aww!

883
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:26,675
And now you're having
bad dreams about your daddy.

884
01:28:26,843 --> 01:28:30,345
I'm really sorry!
You don't know anything about me.

885
01:28:30,513 --> 01:28:32,055
You never have.

886
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:36,351
But Dave does, doesn't he?

887
01:28:36,519 --> 01:28:42,149
Come on, they're your sins.
Live with them. I do.

888
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:46,653
You want to see death?
Take a good look. Lt is beautiful.

889
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:52,159
You've already hurt yourself. Do you want to hurt
her too? Ls that what you want? Huh, do you?

890
01:28:55,788 --> 01:28:58,582
- Help him find Billy Mahoney.
- How's that gonna help?

891
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:02,127
Goddamn it, Joe.
Just help him find Billy, all right?

892
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:04,129
Don't leave him alone.

893
01:29:04,505 --> 01:29:08,175
Why do we want to
find Billy Mahoney?

894
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:14,931
Because young Dr. Dave thinks
he's solved our karmic problems.

895
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:21,146
Atonement, gentlemen.
Atonement?

896
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:26,777
Wait a goddamn minute! Jesus,
you're always running away from me.

897
01:29:26,944 --> 01:29:30,447
Why don't you talk to me?

898
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:37,245
My father shot himself
when I was 5.

899
01:29:37,413 --> 01:29:39,581
And you feel responsible?

900
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:45,962
There was this door in our hallway
and I wasn't supposed to go in…

901
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:51,343
Kids always feel responsible.
You could not have been to blame.

902
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:56,348
David, you said it yourself.
People we've wronged want revenge.

903
01:29:57,558 --> 01:30:02,020
I don't know if this is gonna help,
but going to see Winnie Hicks today,

904
01:30:03,022 --> 01:30:07,150
I mean, I don't know how
to explain it, but it lifted…

905
01:30:09,028 --> 01:30:11,863
Somehow, just asking
for forgiveness…

906
01:30:12,031 --> 01:30:15,909
Winnie Hicks is alive.
My father's dead.

907
01:30:16,077 --> 01:30:20,622
Rachel, your father
is in a good place.

908
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:24,584
He wants you to let him go.

909
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:27,796
Then why is he back?

910
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:45,230
Here.

911
01:30:45,398 --> 01:30:49,693
Where the hell are we?
We'd better get you to a hospital.

912
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:52,612
Nelson.

913
01:30:56,534 --> 01:31:02,164
Come on, this is a shortcut.
I can't believe I remember all this.

914
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:07,002
Holy shit, the neighborhood's
falling apart.

915
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:11,298
- Nelson! Give me the keys!
- Nelson!

916
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:14,968
"' Step on a crack
break your mother's back…"

917
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:25,312
Olly Olly oxen free!
Last one over is a rotten egg!

918
01:31:26,522 --> 01:31:30,609
Come on, boys,
salvation just ahead.

919
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:48,084
This is a graveyard.

920
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:56,843
Nelson, where the fuck are you?
This isn't funny anymore.

921
01:31:57,011 --> 01:31:59,638
It never was.

922
01:31:59,805 --> 01:32:02,516
- Where the hell are you?
- Right here.

923
01:32:07,897 --> 01:32:13,026
This is where Billy lives. Wake up,
you little shit, you've got company!

924
01:32:14,028 --> 01:32:16,696
Wanna know how
I knew he was here?

925
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:20,033
Because I put him here.

926
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:25,330
Billy Mahoney!
No, Nelson, no, don't do it!

927
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:30,585
No! No!

928
01:32:32,672 --> 01:32:33,922
Please don't! No!

929
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:37,050
Ow!

930
01:33:05,037 --> 01:33:09,374
I was taken away from my family
when I was 9 years old.

931
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:15,755
I was sent to Stoneham School
for Boys. I thought I'd paid my dues!

932
01:33:15,923 --> 01:33:21,553
It was an accident.
Let's go home, okay?

933
01:33:21,721 --> 01:33:28,184
Dave's right. I can
still make amends.

934
01:33:28,352 --> 01:33:30,687
How?

935
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:43,533
Nelson?

936
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:47,746
Joe, I gotta borrow your car.
Nelson.

937
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:54,085
Nelson, wait.

938
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:02,135
Oh, my God.

939
01:34:36,712 --> 01:34:42,258
Hello. What? Where?

940
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:52,811
Rachel.

941
01:34:56,190 --> 01:35:00,318
Nelson freaked out.
Joe and STECKLE are stranded.

942
01:35:00,486 --> 01:35:02,112
Will you be all right alone?
Yeah.

943
01:35:02,279 --> 01:35:03,446
Are you sure?
Yeah.

944
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:49,946
Daddy.

945
01:37:53,075 --> 01:37:56,411
Rachel.

946
01:37:57,288 --> 01:38:00,498
Sweetheart.

947
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:06,379
I'm sorry.

948
01:38:10,676 --> 01:38:14,888
Do you forgive me?
Can you ever forgive me?

949
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:54,218
Billy Mahoney died 17 years ago, and whether
he actually is or not, Nelson feels responsible.

950
01:38:54,386 --> 01:38:56,512
Jesus Christ. Do you have
any idea where he went?

951
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:58,973
He ran off mumbling something
about making amends.

952
01:38:59,141 --> 01:39:01,392
How can you make amends
with somebody who's already dead?

953
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:04,187
Oh, my God. You don't think he'd try
to flatline without us, do you?

954
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:05,563
That would be suicide.

955
01:39:18,953 --> 01:39:23,247
David?
No, it's Nelson.

956
01:39:23,415 --> 01:39:26,376
Nelson, where are you?
David's out trying to find you.

957
01:39:26,543 --> 01:39:31,589
Rachel, I wanted
to say I was sorry.

958
01:39:31,757 --> 01:39:33,174
Please, tell David.

959
01:39:34,301 --> 01:39:36,678
I'm sorry for ever getting
any of you involved in this.

960
01:39:36,845 --> 01:39:40,014
No, you don't understand.
None of that matters now.

961
01:39:44,478 --> 01:39:49,649
Rachel, everything matters.
Everything we do matters.

962
01:39:50,859 --> 01:39:54,612
That's why I'm going under again.
No, Nelson, wait.

963
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:57,448
Goodbye, Rachel.
Tell me where you are.

964
01:39:57,616 --> 01:40:00,243
I really am sorry.
Nelson, please. Please…

965
01:40:27,187 --> 01:40:30,523
It's payback for our arrogance.
Save it, Randy.

966
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,434
It's a good thing
I didn't flatline.

967
01:41:06,602 --> 01:41:08,561
My 350-pound babysitter
would be running after me,

968
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:11,230
waving the half-eaten pastrami
sandwich I stole from her.

969
01:41:19,406 --> 01:41:23,201
Okay, Billy Mahoney, come on.

970
01:41:39,343 --> 01:41:40,843
Shit.

971
01:43:04,386 --> 01:43:06,929
- Oh, God.
- Body temp down to 78.

972
01:43:07,097 --> 01:43:09,098
Potassium! He used potassium!
Oh, Christ.

973
01:43:14,021 --> 01:43:16,480
- Joe, electrodes!
- Calcium in.

974
01:43:16,648 --> 01:43:18,858
Three hundred, clear.

975
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:23,613
Nothing.
We have to go again.

976
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:26,532
Clear.
Nothing.

977
01:43:27,659 --> 01:43:28,659
Stop!

978
01:43:37,044 --> 01:43:40,421
Up to 360. Clear!

979
01:43:40,589 --> 01:43:44,467
Nothing. I can't hear anything.
He called me. He called me.

980
01:43:44,635 --> 01:43:46,719
It's been over nine minutes.
Nine minutes?

981
01:43:46,887 --> 01:43:49,138
All right, let's intubate.

982
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:55,144
Damn it, I can't get it in.
His trachea's too tight.

983
01:43:55,312 --> 01:43:56,312
Try again.

984
01:44:01,526 --> 01:44:02,526
Come on, Nelson!

985
01:44:02,736 --> 01:44:06,072
Stop, Billy! Stop, Billy!

986
01:44:06,281 --> 01:44:07,281
No!

987
01:44:12,955 --> 01:44:13,996
Epi in!

988
01:44:18,961 --> 01:44:21,003
- Nothing.
- Eighty-eight degrees.

989
01:44:21,171 --> 01:44:23,798
- Get me 4 mg of atropine ready.
- Four?

990
01:44:32,432 --> 01:44:35,977
David…
Atropine intratracheal. Come on.

991
01:44:36,144 --> 01:44:37,478
This is a truckload, Dave.

992
01:44:37,646 --> 01:44:40,189
This has gotta work. This has gotta work.
Come on back, Nelson.

993
01:44:40,357 --> 01:44:44,235
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, Nelson.

994
01:44:45,529 --> 01:44:47,154
Come on, Nelson.

995
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:51,867
Come on, Nelson.
He's been dead 10 minutes.

996
01:44:52,035 --> 01:44:53,995
Bretylium.
No, he's not in v-fib.

997
01:44:54,162 --> 01:44:56,372
He's dead!
Epi intracardial.

998
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:57,665
No, Rachel, no.

999
01:44:57,833 --> 01:44:59,250
Just do it!

1000
01:45:01,086 --> 01:45:02,086
No!

1001
01:45:03,797 --> 01:45:06,799
Stop! No!
Yeah.

1002
01:45:06,967 --> 01:45:09,969
Don't do it, Billy! Don't!

1003
01:45:10,137 --> 01:45:14,890
I'm sorry! No! No!

1004
01:45:16,059 --> 01:45:17,393
Oh!

1005
01:45:40,959 --> 01:45:42,084
Starting CPR!

1006
01:45:45,213 --> 01:45:48,049
It's been 12 minutes!
He is dead.

1007
01:45:48,216 --> 01:45:51,010
Five, 1000. Breathe!

1008
01:45:54,264 --> 01:45:55,931
Forget about it, Dave.
We lost him.

1009
01:45:56,099 --> 01:45:57,641
No, you son of a bitch!

1010
01:45:57,809 --> 01:46:00,728
Stop it! David, stop it!

1011
01:46:00,896 --> 01:46:03,439
- Stop, David. Stop it, David.
- No!

1012
01:46:03,607 --> 01:46:04,774
Stop it, David!

1013
01:46:04,941 --> 01:46:08,903
David, stop it! David! David!

1014
01:46:09,071 --> 01:46:10,905
Let him go.

1015
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:31,842
We're all responsible for this.
Maybe we deserve this.

1016
01:46:32,010 --> 01:46:36,389
No, no. It's not fair
and it's not right.

1017
01:46:36,556 --> 01:46:42,311
I'm sorry, God! I'm sorry we
stepped on your fucking territory!

1018
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:46,857
I'm sorry!
Isn't that enough?

1019
01:46:50,737 --> 01:46:56,283
Apparently not.
I'll call the police.

1020
01:46:58,912 --> 01:47:02,164
I could hear it in
his voice on the phone.

1021
01:47:03,291 --> 01:47:05,501
Nelson felt he deserved to die.

1022
01:47:05,710 --> 01:47:11,882
Bullshit! Lt was a mistake.
He was just a little kid.

1023
01:47:12,509 --> 01:47:15,177
And he doesn't deserve to die!

1024
01:48:22,787 --> 01:48:26,332
Come on, Nelson! Come on!

1025
01:48:31,463 --> 01:48:34,465
Clear!
No, no, no, wait!

1026
01:48:35,842 --> 01:48:37,468
Oh, my God.

1027
01:48:38,637 --> 01:48:42,056
I got a pulse. I got a pulse.
We've got him! We fucking got him!

1028
01:48:42,224 --> 01:48:43,599
Come on, Nelson,
pick up the beat.

1029
01:48:43,850 --> 01:48:47,436
Easy, easy, easy.
Don't rush him. Oh, my God.

1030
01:48:47,687 --> 01:48:50,773
Come on, Nelson, pick up the beat.
Pick up the beat, pick up the beat.

1031
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:53,526
Don't rush him.

1032
01:49:00,325 --> 01:49:03,327
That's it, that's it, that's it.

1033
01:49:07,749 --> 01:49:09,959
There we go.

1034
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:18,676
Hail Mary, praise Jesus, and all
that stuff. Oh, thank you, Jesus.

1035
01:49:18,843 --> 01:49:20,302
Hi, Nelson.

1036
01:49:21,805 --> 01:49:25,099
Don't try to talk.
I've got to get this on tape.

1037
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:44,577
He said…

1038
01:49:46,913 --> 01:49:50,708
He said it wasn't
such a good day to die.

1039
01:50:03,555 --> 01:50:05,347
Thank you.
