1
00:00:21,127 --> 00:00:23,125
My name is Jerrod Hartfelder.

2
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:27,345
I turn a video production company.
Here in California.

3
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,867
We focus primarily in-
on reality shows.

4
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:35,687
If you ever seen the show, "Tornado
Trackers, "is one of ours.

5
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,608
A club came to us by mail.

6
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:43,429
It was an episode of a reality show
new called "Grave Encounters".

7
00:00:43,454 --> 00:00:47,750
It was run by a young
producer named Lance Preston.

8
00:00:47,774 --> 00:00:52,370
The idea was that your group
paranormal investigators,

9
00:00:52,395 --> 00:00:57,190
investigate spirits
places and things like that.

10
00:00:57,215 --> 00:00:59,413
And this was long before
any other

11
00:00:59,414 --> 00:01:01,610
program of the same nature
that there are now around.

12
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:03,933
It seemed that he was not in his time.

13
00:01:05,257 --> 00:01:07,654
My name is Lance Preston.

14
00:01:07,679 --> 00:01:09,627
When I was small and
my parents moved us to

15
00:01:09,628 --> 00:01:11,575
a house, which later
found to be haunted.

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,997
The things it found
stayed with me forever.

17
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:18,318
Since then, I'm obsessed
in trying to capture evidence

18
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:20,741
and show that these things are real.

19
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:22,514
Come with me and
my team

20
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:24,262
paranormal investigators
professional

21
00:01:24,287 --> 00:01:26,085
while we risk
to enter the premises

22
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,883
Most Haunted
known to man.

23
00:01:27,908 --> 00:01:31,604
We'll be all night, and
with cameras to record everything.

24
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:34,626
If you're ready, it is
time to attend the

25
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:37,848
Grave Encounters
(Meeting Cemetery)

26
00:01:37,873 --> 00:01:41,070
Everything seemed to be going well.

27
00:01:41,095 --> 00:01:45,790
The cuts were to be fantastic.
We were very excited.

28
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:48,113
We had the same thing.

29
00:01:51,534 --> 00:01:54,131
And then of course, they
did the episode 6.

30
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,953
Want to say something else?

31
00:01:56,978 --> 00:01:59,975
Yes! I want to be very
clear about this.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,598
What is about to
see is not a movie.

33
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,121
Ok?

34
00:02:04,146 --> 00:02:06,893
There are 66 hours of film
continuous, unedited,

35
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:09,640
that was written for
Lance's show.

36
00:02:09,665 --> 00:02:14,261
It was not manipulated in any way.

37
00:02:14,286 --> 00:02:17,682
It's just continuous film, only
edited because of length.

38
00:02:21,204 --> 00:02:28,196
(Do not copy the movie)

39
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,117
Action!

40
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:36,038
Hello! Hello! Test Site, you!

41
00:02:36,063 --> 00:02:37,662
Lance Preston!

42
00:02:37,687 --> 00:02:39,685
Catch and background
all the time.

43
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,508
I'll just move a little, wait.

44
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:43,431
Ready? Yes I'm ready!

45
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:46,652
It's still recording.
I want to get you well.

46
00:02:46,677 --> 00:02:49,674
A palace back. Is it good?

47
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:54,395
Good Afternoon! Welcome to a new
Grave Encounters episode.

48
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:56,617
I'm your host
as always, Lance Preston.

49
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:58,840
And tonight I am very
happy to take you to visit

50
00:02:58,865 --> 00:03:01,662
One of the most terrifying
I have ever seen.

51
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:05,183
Behind me is the Hospital
Psychiatric Collingwood.

52
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:09,504
This is one of six buildings
an area of ??80 hectares.

53
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:12,326
Wait, wait, is
to pass a car.

54
00:03:12,351 --> 00:03:14,948
Matt continues from there,
I will not say that again.

55
00:03:14,973 --> 00:03:18,370
Between 1895 and 1960

56
00:03:18,395 --> 00:03:25,188
It was home to more than 80,000 men
sick and mentally disturbed.

57
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:30,408
After its closure in 1963
several ghosts have been seen.

58
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:34,079
Objects that move alone.
And sometimes you hear

59
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,725
the laughter of patients
condemned to live here.

60
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,944
Tonight, my team and I
we will be locked for 8 hours.

61
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:45,967
Locked inside,
during the hours

62
00:03:45,968 --> 00:03:47,965
that phenomena are
more frequent.

63
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:51,086
Using the tools most
advanced to hunt ghosts

64
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:54,608
we look, how
were known,

65
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,104
ghosts of the Hospital
Psychiatric Collingwood.

66
00:03:58,928 --> 00:04:01,226
Cut. Nice!

67
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:02,050
It was?

68
00:04:02,674 --> 00:04:04,872
Morgan! Morgan Turner! Yes Ola Ola

69
00:04:04,897 --> 00:04:06,695
Sorry! Thanks for coming.

70
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,618
I know the roads and everything.
Do not worry.

71
00:04:08,643 --> 00:04:10,342
I'm really happy to do this.

72
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:12,364
This will even appear on television?
Yes, hopefully.

73
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:14,088
Do not look for me
I'm just recording.

74
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:15,711
Do not worry, it records everything.

75
00:04:15,736 --> 00:04:17,834
Morgan is here with me
Turner, local historian.

76
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:20,256
Morgan is here today

77
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:23,578
to tell us about the
dark past of the hospital.

78
00:04:23,603 --> 00:04:26,700
Morgan? Can you tell us when
the hospital was built?

79
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:32,219
The story is very similar to
other institutes of the same time.

80
00:04:32,244 --> 00:04:34,542
Built in 1893

81
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:41,060
To relieve overcrowding
the County's hospital in Denver.

82
00:04:41,085 --> 00:04:44,681
At the time, mental illness
was not well perceived.

83
00:04:44,706 --> 00:04:45,805
Treatments were only
Many pioneers.

84
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,425
Psychiatric Hospitals like this
were seen as a trash

85
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,548
for family members
embarrassing, rather

86
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:54,646
a place where
could even heal.

87
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:55,870
Right.

88
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:58,492
The conditions were minimal,

89
00:04:58,517 --> 00:05:04,211
People slept on the floor, the
times, without blankets or clothing.

90
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:07,333
It was not at all, a place
fun place to be stuck.

91
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:10,155
Can you tell us about
Arthur Freinken?

92
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:13,775
Your story should be the most
interesting about this hospital.

93
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,998
Yes, right.
I assumed I would ask that.

94
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:18,820
Freinken was a neurosurgeon
Harvard graduate.

95
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:22,641
It was placed here from 1937 to 1948.

96
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,613
He was very
known due to their

97
00:05:25,614 --> 00:05:28,560
experimental methods
to operate the brain.

98
00:05:28,585 --> 00:05:32,381
He started the
frontal lobe surgery.

99
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:36,502
Performed about 140 surgeries
to the frontal lobe, the cable.

100
00:05:36,527 --> 00:05:39,724
August 15, 1948.

101
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:42,920
Six patients had fled
their rooms,

102
00:05:42,945 --> 00:05:45,593
and stabbed Freinken
in your office.

103
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:48,240
His body was found by
a nurse the next day.

104
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,761
Unfortunately, this death was
completely irrelevant due to

105
00:05:51,762 --> 00:05:55,258
death of the famous baseball player,
David Bruce, the same day.

106
00:05:55,283 --> 00:05:58,380
Wow! This story is 'the nuts'!

107
00:05:58,405 --> 00:06:02,400
Morgan, give us your opinion more
honest, believe in ghosts?

108
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:10,217
I do not know. But this would be if there
a good place to go looking for them.

109
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:13,090
The traffic was even
crap today.

110
00:06:13,091 --> 00:06:15,137
We did not take long, were
about 6 hours away is not it?

111
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:17,660
"Death awaits you." Oh my God!

112
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:21,281
Looks like we'll find out.
This is so silly!

113
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:24,453
This may take
rather, they're

114
00:06:24,454 --> 00:06:27,600
old current.
We should not use them.

115
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,823
Take it easy bro.

116
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:32,844
Slow motion, background music.
And it is scary.

117
00:06:32,869 --> 00:06:37,265
Well, that's it. Here we go ...

118
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:39,188
Go take ...

119
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:44,108
Oh my God!

120
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:47,130
This is the entrance
Main building.

121
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:49,452
Nice! Yes!

122
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:53,873
If you are family members, make
check-in at the reception, right there.

123
00:06:53,898 --> 00:06:56,595
This is scary as shit!
It's crazy!

124
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:58,718
Are you picking up? Records everything!

125
00:06:58,743 --> 00:07:00,341
I shoot everything!

126
00:07:01,065 --> 00:07:03,463
Do not smoke.

127
00:07:03,488 --> 00:07:06,884
Obviously you can not. Do not try.
It has a fire alarm.

128
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:12,104
I'm here with Kenny Sandivol.
Current caretaker, for eight years.

129
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:15,625
Kenny! Would you say that this
place is haunted?

130
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:21,245
Well, I've never done this before.
Should I speak to you or the camera?

131
00:07:21,369 --> 00:07:22,568
Only ... ignore the camera.

132
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:28,387
I do not know if I believe in spirits
or ghosts or anything.

133
00:07:28,412 --> 00:07:31,209
But since I'm here
seen very strange things.

134
00:07:31,234 --> 00:07:34,231
Especially at night,
can hear the

135
00:07:34,232 --> 00:07:37,228
sounds of the pipe and
of the construction.

136
00:07:37,253 --> 00:07:42,648
It is very difficult to say, but
I'm not alone.

137
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,469
Come see!

138
00:07:47,193 --> 00:07:48,791
Let? Ok

139
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:51,214
It is as if these corridors
be infinite.

140
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:52,438
Ah, yes.

141
00:07:52,462 --> 00:07:55,959
Hard to believe that this was the home
of thousands of mentally ill.

142
00:07:55,984 --> 00:07:57,183
Exact thousands.

143
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,705
The day is so dark here.

144
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:03,226
Are you afraid? Yes.

145
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:06,248
There are plenty of
interest, which I will show you.

146
00:08:06,273 --> 00:08:11,468
Guys! If you think that now is
wait until dark tonight.

147
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:13,890
None of these work lights,
is just too dark.

148
00:08:13,915 --> 00:08:16,912
You see this window here? Yes.

149
00:08:16,937 --> 00:08:20,334
Closing it before nightfall,
and sometimes I

150
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:23,730
here in the morning, and is
fully open.

151
00:08:23,755 --> 00:08:24,954
What!

152
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:26,178
I can not figure out what it is.

153
00:08:26,203 --> 00:08:29,999
It is as if something or someone was
trying to get out or so.

154
00:08:30,923 --> 00:08:33,121
It is definitely a point
interest in the paranormal.

155
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:38,640
Here you? Perfect.

156
00:08:46,857 --> 00:08:51,152
How is it supposed to help
people in those cubicles?

157
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:57,271
Oh my God!
This is officially fucked!

158
00:08:57,296 --> 00:09:00,393
Is this real? Yes, totally real.

159
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,814
One patient was here
caught a good few years.

160
00:09:03,815 --> 00:09:06,212
And this is what left us.

161
00:09:06,237 --> 00:09:08,235
He spent his time
write on the walls.

162
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,957
Then it was the same
a quarter of patients?

163
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:13,180
Yes, this was even the fourth
one of the patients. Really?

164
00:09:13,205 --> 00:09:16,801
I do not know if he died here, but
been here a very long time.

165
00:09:16,826 --> 00:09:18,424
Very scary.

166
00:09:19,848 --> 00:09:24,043
What the fuck!? Kenny!
This is awesome!

167
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:26,266
Fire, the acoustics are
same shit here.

168
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,790
What is this?

169
00:09:27,815 --> 00:09:31,111
Supposedly a young
patient committed suicide here.

170
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:33,234
What? Right here?!

171
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:38,254
One patient committed suicide right here?
Yes, cut his wrists in this bath.

172
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,477
Oh my God, it's so sad.

173
00:09:40,502 --> 00:09:43,399
Some say they hear the sound of
flow of water coming out.

174
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:45,821
Never heard such a thing.

175
00:09:46,046 --> 00:09:47,245
Where are we going now?

176
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:48,668
Let the service tunnels.

177
00:09:48,993 --> 00:09:51,191
Can not wait to see them.

178
00:09:53,513 --> 00:09:55,411
Pssst! Are you okay?

179
00:09:56,136 --> 00:09:59,232
Kenny! This is exactly
what I was looking for!

180
00:09:59,257 --> 00:10:01,355
These tunnels all the buildings together.

181
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,177
They have almost a mile long.

182
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,896
This is a maze down here.
You can easily lose yourself here.

183
00:10:09,921 --> 00:10:18,413
Once I got here, and the
air was very cold.

184
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:23,133
I was so quiet. I felt like
if someone were watching me.

185
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:27,453
A very strange feeling.

186
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:31,874
What? What? It's just my shadow.

187
00:10:34,196 --> 00:10:36,994
This is Garry Krefeld.
Krefeld company.

188
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,415
He worked here some time ago.

189
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,038
Is that true?

190
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:46,159
In 1983, the state was
try to make some changes here

191
00:10:46,184 --> 00:10:50,180
but in the end it was all the fucking.
Damn sorry.

192
00:10:50,205 --> 00:10:52,503
You want to say again? Yes is better.

193
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,725
Anyway,
I and my staff

194
00:10:54,726 --> 00:10:56,923
came here about
two weeks.

195
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,745
And experienced any type
of supernatural phenomenon?

196
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:06,663
The boys thought
heard weird noises.

197
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:10,060
And disappeared
some tools.

198
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:14,380
I thought they were thieves but
never seen any, so ...

199
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:17,003
And there was an accident, right? Yes ..

200
00:11:17,027 --> 00:11:21,023
One of the boys went upstairs.
Right there.

201
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,596
He swears that something
pushed the stairs.

202
00:11:23,597 --> 00:11:26,143
He gave a very hard fall.

203
00:11:26,168 --> 00:11:29,665
He hurt himself on his knees, and gave up.

204
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,737
Does not sound like a
residual haunting.

205
00:11:31,738 --> 00:11:33,785
Sounds more like a
intelligent haunting.

206
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:39,604
A residual haunting is
known as an echo of the past.

207
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:41,627
That repeats itself endlessly.

208
00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:45,149
An intelligent haunting
is actually a spirit.

209
00:11:45,174 --> 00:11:47,471
Interact with intent.

210
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:50,094
There have been reports
people who say they

211
00:11:50,095 --> 00:11:52,691
been pushed, scratched
or even fired.

212
00:11:52,716 --> 00:11:55,113
It's rare but it happens.

213
00:11:55,138 --> 00:11:58,135
So, you used
spend much time here?

214
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,856
Yes, the kids in high school
came here a lot.

215
00:12:01,881 --> 00:12:03,680
You know. Exit and such.

216
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:04,903
And then saw something?

217
00:12:05,228 --> 00:12:07,026
Yes.

218
00:12:07,051 --> 00:12:10,148
We were even here.

219
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:14,169
Here. The date or something.

220
00:12:14,993 --> 00:12:22,885
I looked up and I swear to God.
I swear I saw someone there.

221
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:30,202
One was wearing white robes ...
as a hospital gown ... yes.

222
00:12:30,227 --> 00:12:32,625
And had his head shaved.

223
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:37,645
Appearance of full spectrum!

224
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,667
Why not ask
quickly to the gardener?

225
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:46,186
Sorry! Sorry sir!

226
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:48,359
We are recording a program
TV, and we were

227
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,507
she liked to think of giving
a quick interview.

228
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,828
I am here with the gardener
local, Javier Horteguez.

229
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:58,348
Javier, have you ever noticed something
stranger around the building?

230
00:12:58,673 --> 00:13:01,171
No. Not really. What do you mean?

231
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:05,791
Well, he heard strange sounds or
witnessed anything paranormal?

232
00:13:05,816 --> 00:13:07,614
I started working here.

233
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,637
He started working. Okay.

234
00:13:09,662 --> 00:13:14,157
TC can take a break?
And if you do for the camera?

235
00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:15,381
Pretend you saw something?

236
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:18,502
I have to go back to work! Ok

237
00:13:18,527 --> 00:13:23,122
It will be fast! Wait, just
wait a bit. You do not have more?

238
00:13:25,844 --> 00:13:27,642
They are $ 20.

239
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:32,063
I am here with the gardener
local, Javier Horteguez.

240
00:13:32,088 --> 00:13:36,084
Javier, saw something in the past
10 years you worked here?

241
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:40,005
Yes, I saw a ghost. Right there.

242
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:42,327
It was very scary.

243
00:13:42,352 --> 00:13:46,548
A spirit outside the building.
Unbelievable.

244
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:49,120
This is a point of interest
supernatural different

245
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:51,668
any that
have recorded before.

246
00:13:51,693 --> 00:13:54,490
Three, two, one ...

247
00:13:57,112 --> 00:14:02,706
Due to the huge size of the
We place a medium flame.

248
00:14:02,731 --> 00:14:06,328
Houston we Gris
help in the investigation.

249
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,948
Houston! Are you feeling anything?

250
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:16,942
Wow! There is an energy
unbelievable here!

251
00:14:17,466 --> 00:14:19,164
It's like thousands of voices
talking at the same time.

252
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:20,863
This sound is deafening!

253
00:14:21,887 --> 00:14:24,584
There is something more.

254
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:34,398
There is something more.

255
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:36,720
It's like a dark spirit.

256
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:39,543
It may possibly be a demon.

257
00:14:39,568 --> 00:14:42,465
We have to be extremely
careful tonight.

258
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,685
We do not want to play with this thing.
No way.

259
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,205
It's here.

260
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,427
Are you feeling anything?

261
00:14:54,452 --> 00:14:56,450
Yes.

262
00:14:57,174 --> 00:15:00,871
I'm feeling a
great sadness here.

263
00:15:00,896 --> 00:15:03,493
A deep sadness.

264
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:11,859
I see a patient.
A female patient.

265
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,704
A girl. There is water, red ...
red water.

266
00:15:18,128 --> 00:15:28,717
Blood. Blood. He died here.
He cut his wrists in the bathtub.

267
00:15:29,142 --> 00:15:32,838
The guard said that a girl
had died here.

268
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,861
Houston! This is incredible.

269
00:15:34,886 --> 00:15:38,382
The spirit is still with us.

270
00:15:41,904 --> 00:15:43,901
Cut.

271
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:45,125
Yes!

272
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:49,845
There was too much? No.

273
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:59,261
Lance! How do you feel about
to your episode six? Very well.

274
00:15:59,286 --> 00:16:00,484
It is a good place.

275
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:02,857
Do you think this is because
we'll see a ghost?

276
00:16:02,858 --> 00:16:05,205
Yes, thousands of them.
I'm sure.

277
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,526
Wow! You try to sound like
less antiseptic.

278
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,548
It would be great.
But if we can not, I

279
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:14,545
to make sure we get
a good scares.

280
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:19,065
Wait, wait! TC!

281
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,588
Want to record something to the setting of the sun?

282
00:16:22,012 --> 00:16:23,711
Son of a bitch!

283
00:17:51,545 --> 00:17:53,344
House of the window, tip!

284
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:12,049
Ok, this is scary as shit.
I'll leave.

285
00:18:23,563 --> 00:18:28,957
Ok, here we are with our wise
Grave Encounters technician, Matt.

286
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,679
Matt! Why not show us the
What are you doing here?

287
00:18:31,704 --> 00:18:33,552
Installed ten cameras
in static

288
00:18:33,553 --> 00:18:35,400
main points
paranormal activity.

289
00:18:35,425 --> 00:18:37,124
Is recorded on tape.

290
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,147
But it also saved on the hard drive.

291
00:18:39,172 --> 00:18:41,969
All who come here is on
to my computer wirelessly.

292
00:18:41,994 --> 00:18:44,491
So always know
what is happening.

293
00:18:44,516 --> 00:18:46,064
Well done Matt!
Why not show to us

294
00:18:46,065 --> 00:18:47,613
what each one
this equipment?

295
00:18:47,638 --> 00:18:50,835
This is an EMF meter.
It is a device that

296
00:18:50,836 --> 00:18:54,031
measures levels of
electricity in the air.

297
00:18:54,056 --> 00:18:56,129
So the main idea
is that when the meter

298
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,202
EMF fields detects human
remains stable.

299
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,276
While the fields
caused by activity

300
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:02,348
paranormal will produce
peaks in reading.

301
00:19:02,373 --> 00:19:04,770
Infrared sensors.

302
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:09,391
The idea is the same as the EMF, but this
shows changes in temperature.

303
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,512
It is believed that the spirits
cause a loss of temperature.

304
00:19:12,537 --> 00:19:14,835
Known in the community
paranormal, such as cold spots.

305
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,457
One, two, three ...

306
00:19:17,482 --> 00:19:20,679
This is a recorder
analog audio. Right.

307
00:19:20,704 --> 00:19:23,901
It is used to capture EVPs.
Oh wait ...

308
00:19:23,926 --> 00:19:28,021
Explains to the audience
What is an EVP.

309
00:19:28,046 --> 00:19:30,244
Electronic Voice Phenomenon
(Electronic Voice Phenomenon).

310
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:34,964
Capture sounds that the ear
humans can not detect.

311
00:19:34,989 --> 00:19:37,337
So when you play,
if we hear something,

312
00:19:37,338 --> 00:19:39,684
means that something is
trying to communicate with us.

313
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:43,006
This is my favorite.
The Geiger counter.

314
00:19:43,031 --> 00:19:45,079
Turns the sound here, and
you're ready to go.

315
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,127
Look at this! It is spectacular.

316
00:19:47,951 --> 00:19:53,745
I assure you, if there is anything
paranormal here, we'll catch it.

317
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:57,966
Well folks, we are ready
to be locked.

318
00:19:57,991 --> 00:20:00,138
My friend Kenny, the
janitor of the building,

319
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:02,286
will have the honor of
locked inside.

320
00:20:02,311 --> 00:20:07,006
Kenny, thank you!
See you at 6 am.

321
00:20:07,031 --> 00:20:09,329
Six hours exactly. Good luck!

322
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:15,348
I am a demon. A demon child.

323
00:20:16,372 --> 00:20:17,571
I can not wait to see you in the morning.

324
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:23,989
Yes, we have to spend the
night with these two freaks.

325
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,911
What are you doing?
I'm talking to Kenny.

326
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:28,984
He locked the door?
It's good for the show.

327
00:20:28,985 --> 00:20:31,032
Do not worry about it.

328
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:32,855
What do we do if we need
more material?

329
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,577
Well done! This is what will happen.

330
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:40,597
This is the best place
ever investigated.

331
00:20:40,622 --> 00:20:42,620
And the most dangerous.

332
00:20:42,645 --> 00:20:45,242
I want to draw attention
to the fact that

333
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:47,839
have been built
almost like a prison.

334
00:20:47,864 --> 00:20:50,612
All the windows have bars.
Could never

335
00:20:50,613 --> 00:20:53,359
leave, even
we wanted.

336
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:56,081
We are locked here
Kenny in until the

337
00:20:56,082 --> 00:20:58,778
janitor of the building in
come get the morning.

338
00:20:58,803 --> 00:21:01,800
We will be working
in total darkness.

339
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:05,322
Capturing all three
night vision cameras.

340
00:21:05,346 --> 00:21:07,294
More static cameras
Matt set up in the

341
00:21:07,295 --> 00:21:09,242
main points
paranormal activity.

342
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:12,664
Okay folks! When you are
ready, it's about time we had a

343
00:21:13,888 --> 00:21:18,083
Grave Encounters!

344
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:21,005
Okay, we're
now go through the

345
00:21:21,006 --> 00:21:23,902
dark corridors of
old institution.

346
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:28,822
Abandoned for over 50 years.

347
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:33,842
We are looking for souls
were trapped in life.

348
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:37,164
And probably trapped
after life.

349
00:21:38,188 --> 00:21:42,084
I feel a cold, it's cold here.

350
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:44,756
This was the corridor
where you could see

351
00:21:44,757 --> 00:21:47,403
the appearance of the person
with the shaved head,

352
00:21:47,428 --> 00:21:49,726
to hang down the hall.

353
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:52,148
Sasha, we use the PVS.

354
00:21:53,372 --> 00:21:56,069
Is there someone here with us?

355
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:01,289
You were a patient here?

356
00:22:01,314 --> 00:22:04,910
You used to live here in the hospital?
Down again.

357
00:22:05,435 --> 00:22:08,032
"Is there someone here with us?"

358
00:22:10,754 --> 00:22:13,352
"You were a patient here?"

359
00:22:15,674 --> 00:22:18,272
"You used to live here in the hospital?"

360
00:22:21,493 --> 00:22:23,391
Nothing.

361
00:22:24,315 --> 00:22:25,714
Wait! I felt like ...

362
00:22:26,338 --> 00:22:29,235
Spirit, thou hast no
to be afraid of us.

363
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,658
If you're here, show yourself!

364
00:22:32,882 --> 00:22:35,978
I think it is getting cold as
move along, is to join us.

365
00:22:36,003 --> 00:22:38,001
Whether we will be here.

366
00:22:38,026 --> 00:22:43,820
If there is a spirit here
us, give us a sign.

367
00:22:44,545 --> 00:22:46,842
Open the window!

368
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:49,664
Even just a little bit.

369
00:22:57,082 --> 00:23:03,675
Now I use this camera to
try to capture paranormal anomalies.

370
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,197
Normally, there are
seen by the human eye.

371
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:09,020
It is known as
spirit photography.

372
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:17,636
One more.

373
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:19,659
We expect that
photos are revealed.

374
00:23:19,684 --> 00:23:24,379
If there is a ghost behind
me, just let us know later.

375
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:32,196
It was you who wrote these walls?

376
00:23:32,221 --> 00:23:34,918
Or just wanted to try to communicate?

377
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:43,934
Why not try
communicate with me now?

378
00:23:50,652 --> 00:24:00,042
If the patient who killed himself in this room,
in the same bath, is here now,

379
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:04,163
that show.

380
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:12,779
I'm really scared here.

381
00:24:13,104 --> 00:24:16,500
The chambers 2 and 4 have
temperature gauges.

382
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,016
Personally, I am the only one
have to be here alone?

383
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:29,936
Houston, feel anything?

384
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:33,957
I feel a very negative energy here.

385
00:24:34,582 --> 00:24:40,875
Not just one but many.

386
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,794
If there are spirits here
below, please show yourselves!

387
00:24:49,816 --> 00:24:52,513
Do you hear a sound.

388
00:24:53,437 --> 00:24:57,833
As I said, it seems that
these pipes are endless.

389
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,654
And it smells bad here.

390
00:25:03,177 --> 00:25:05,575
Heard what? I also heard.

391
00:25:11,494 --> 00:25:14,990
Ok, we hear something. What was that?

392
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:17,912
I do not know, come here. Here, follow me.

393
00:25:18,636 --> 00:25:21,733
Where does it sound? Behind this door.

394
00:25:21,758 --> 00:25:23,357
Ali

395
00:25:24,081 --> 00:25:26,778
Want to open it?
You can slide the camera?

396
00:25:26,803 --> 00:25:29,500
Oh, not really. Damn!

397
00:25:29,525 --> 00:25:32,223
Shit.

398
00:25:37,442 --> 00:25:40,639
Shut up. They are rats.

399
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,562
No way! Really?

400
00:25:42,587 --> 00:25:45,484
It's nothing more.

401
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:48,905
You're an idiot! There was a joke!

402
00:25:48,906 --> 00:25:49,905
This is almost as scary
as the "Saw Dawn"!

403
00:26:48,994 --> 00:26:52,091
Can this be plasmo-waste.

404
00:26:52,115 --> 00:26:55,512
Discovered for the first time
Team Record Encounters?

405
00:26:56,761 --> 00:27:00,657
I think we should give more
a look at the top.

406
00:27:00,682 --> 00:27:04,078
Saves me a few shots in the hallways,
does that chilling effect.

407
00:27:04,103 --> 00:27:07,699
As we did Playview Mansion.

408
00:27:07,724 --> 00:27:10,721
Yes yes, and then cut.

409
00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:21,136
Scary, scary, scary.

410
00:27:24,757 --> 00:27:28,353
"CHECKERS OF THE DEAD. KING ME."

411
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:33,572
What the fuck?!

412
00:27:33,597 --> 00:27:36,694
"GLORY HOLE"

413
00:27:37,318 --> 00:27:39,616
Kitchen of the dead.

414
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,836
Said to cause me to lunch, bitch!

415
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:47,258
What the fuck is that?

416
00:27:47,283 --> 00:27:50,480
This is scarier.
How did we miss this?

417
00:27:50,505 --> 00:27:53,202
Lance is gonna love me!

418
00:27:53,227 --> 00:27:55,724
Shit.

419
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:04,440
Wait, wait, wait ...

420
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:11,758
Yes, my dear?

421
00:28:11,783 --> 00:28:14,680
She is crying, give him the phone.

422
00:28:15,504 --> 00:28:18,401
Hello sweet!

423
00:28:18,426 --> 00:28:20,124
What your mother told me
was that you fear

424
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:21,822
the monsters are
under your bed.

425
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:24,245
We've had this conversation?

426
00:28:24,246 --> 00:28:29,264
The monsters are not real.

427
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:33,085
Even if they were not
came to our house.

428
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,207
You know that Daddy will take care of you.

429
00:28:36,931 --> 00:28:39,928
Says the mother who gave permission
to sleep with her today.

430
00:28:39,953 --> 00:28:43,249
Daddy will not be
at home until tomorrow.

431
00:28:43,274 --> 00:28:46,671
We will go to a pizzeria.
The father will be home soon.

432
00:28:46,696 --> 00:28:49,293
Bye bye.

433
00:28:54,813 --> 00:28:58,309
Because I got myself into this?

434
00:29:06,525 --> 00:29:09,722
Shit, it's cold.

435
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:12,744
What the fuck was that!

436
00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:15,566
Guys, stop this shit!
I'm not playing!

437
00:29:18,488 --> 00:29:21,285
It is not the best time
to do this shit!

438
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,308
What the fuck?!

439
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,528
Where are people?

440
00:29:28,553 --> 00:29:30,551
Maybe it was the wind or so.

441
00:29:30,576 --> 00:29:32,873
Solid. Not a tornado
would be able to move it.

442
00:29:32,874 --> 00:29:35,171
How do you think
it weighs?

443
00:29:35,196 --> 00:29:38,692
TC, how do you move?

444
00:29:38,717 --> 00:29:41,415
Whatever it was,
scared me like anything.

445
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,137
You can not explain?

446
00:29:44,162 --> 00:29:47,159
I have told you. I was shooting,
then turned and the door closed.

447
00:29:47,184 --> 00:29:49,981
I thought you were the first.
Were you shooting?

448
00:29:50,006 --> 00:29:52,603
I had already told you.
You were so busy ...

449
00:29:52,628 --> 00:29:55,126
Grave? Let's see.

450
00:29:57,948 --> 00:30:00,145
Oh my God!

451
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,568
That's scary.

452
00:30:03,692 --> 00:30:06,689
I accept your apology,
I accept your apology.

453
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,111
I do not think you saw that!

454
00:30:09,136 --> 00:30:11,634
The footage we just saw the
moments ago, was captured by

455
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:14,056
TC cameramen.

456
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:17,777
This door behind
me close by itself.

457
00:30:17,802 --> 00:30:23,197
There was no wind, no open windows
that could have caused this,

458
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:27,517
Let's now
establish contact.

459
00:30:32,337 --> 00:30:37,932
Is there anyone here with us?
Please make a noise.

460
00:30:39,855 --> 00:30:42,552
Batam in anything.

461
00:30:44,775 --> 00:30:47,372
Feel free
to close the door

462
00:30:47,373 --> 00:30:49,969
as did also
the bit with the TC.

463
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:53,790
Feel free to hit with
her with the strength you want.

464
00:30:53,915 --> 00:30:57,312
Force Shut it!

465
00:31:00,134 --> 00:31:02,531
Now, please give us a sign!

466
00:31:05,853 --> 00:31:08,650
Spirit, I invoke thee
to appear.

467
00:31:11,472 --> 00:31:16,567
If there is someone here,
give us a sign ...

468
00:31:17,391 --> 00:31:19,689
Shit. Shit.

469
00:31:19,714 --> 00:31:22,011
Do you really think
we had something here.

470
00:31:22,036 --> 00:31:25,133
Shit! What was it?

471
00:31:25,158 --> 00:31:26,956
Oh my God!

472
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:29,179
That was very
scary people!

473
00:31:29,404 --> 00:31:31,302
He came here!

474
00:31:35,523 --> 00:31:36,721
Shit, I see nothing.

475
00:31:36,746 --> 00:31:38,844
Did you hear?

476
00:31:43,664 --> 00:31:46,861
What? Oh shit ...

477
00:31:46,886 --> 00:31:48,484
Shit ...

478
00:31:52,505 --> 00:31:53,904
What the fuck?!

479
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:56,126
Hello!

480
00:31:59,048 --> 00:32:01,546
This is fucked up people.

481
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:07,864
What is this personal? Matt?

482
00:32:07,889 --> 00:32:10,686
Matt, is there anyone there?

483
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:13,808
Is there someone at some of the
floors above us?

484
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:16,830
No. What is happening?

485
00:32:16,855 --> 00:32:19,053
Does anyone know what we're here
shoot and walk with us to enjoy.

486
00:32:19,078 --> 00:32:21,176
Why do not we get out?

487
00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:24,497
Because this is where the sound came.
Jesus Christ.

488
00:32:24,722 --> 00:32:26,520
Hello!

489
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:29,742
Is there anyone here?
Somebody's kidding us.

490
00:32:31,465 --> 00:32:35,261
If someone is here to enjoy
us, no joke!

491
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,783
I'll call the police!
We have the right to be here!

492
00:32:38,808 --> 00:32:41,605
We have permission, and you do not!

493
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,027
Lower your voice. I'm trying to talk!

494
00:32:44,052 --> 00:32:47,549
Calm down guys. This is something real.

495
00:32:50,171 --> 00:32:53,468
I will use the EVP.

496
00:32:54,991 --> 00:32:57,388
What's your name?

497
00:32:57,413 --> 00:32:59,711
What do you want?

498
00:33:01,135 --> 00:33:04,132
You are in the room with us?

499
00:33:04,157 --> 00:33:06,854
Where are you?

500
00:33:06,879 --> 00:33:08,977
Come on, Sasha. Add to give.

501
00:33:09,002 --> 00:33:10,200
"What's your name?"

502
00:33:10,225 --> 00:33:12,223
"What do you want?"

503
00:33:13,247 --> 00:33:15,545
"Are you in the room with us?"

504
00:33:15,969 --> 00:33:18,567
"Where are you?"

505
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:22,688
What's that sound? What is this?

506
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:30,704
What the fuck was that?
What the fuck was that?

507
00:33:31,628 --> 00:33:34,625
No way! I recorded it.

508
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,348
Sasha!

509
00:33:36,373 --> 00:33:40,669
Please, please, I
want to go back to the entrance!

510
00:33:40,694 --> 00:33:42,342
I played some shit!

511
00:33:42,343 --> 00:33:43,991
Was some shit
breathe with me!

512
00:33:44,016 --> 00:33:49,410
We gotta go, gotta go now!

513
00:33:49,435 --> 00:33:52,432
Wait, wait a second.
Wait for what?

514
00:33:52,457 --> 00:33:54,854
We shot this program to what?
Five episodes?

515
00:33:54,855 --> 00:33:57,252
And we've never seen anything like it before.

516
00:33:57,277 --> 00:34:01,073
I do not care!
I just want to get out of here!

517
00:34:01,098 --> 00:34:04,694
Houston, going down there
and turns right ok?

518
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:06,717
I'd rather be down there.
No, no.

519
00:34:06,742 --> 00:34:09,140
I need another face in the camera.

520
00:34:09,165 --> 00:34:11,862
I'm really scared, I think
I can not do this ...

521
00:34:11,887 --> 00:34:14,884
Be a fucking work ok?
Retains the character.

522
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:17,606
We found something here.

523
00:34:17,631 --> 00:34:19,429
I do not do that.

524
00:34:19,454 --> 00:34:21,452
Ok, I'll be back. I'll go with Houston.

525
00:34:22,176 --> 00:34:24,574
No no. You come with me, come on.

526
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:27,696
What are you doing?
Are you kidding? Did you see that?

527
00:34:27,721 --> 00:34:32,316
We could find thousands of things!
Make millions ($$)!

528
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,936
Even the moments
this same corridor

529
00:34:36,961 --> 00:34:40,058
undeniable proven track record
of paranormal activity.

530
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:46,476
Sasha was terrified because
a ghost touched her hair.

531
00:34:47,301 --> 00:34:50,897
Let's try to make contact.

532
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:57,315
Spirit, which hangs in the hallway

533
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,688
to beg
show us a sign.

534
00:34:59,689 --> 00:35:02,036
Show yourself!

535
00:35:04,658 --> 00:35:07,155
Please!

536
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:12,175
If you're still here
us, give us a sign.

537
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:16,770
It plays a sound or
in my hair.

538
00:35:20,392 --> 00:35:22,989
Do you see anything?

539
00:35:23,014 --> 00:35:26,510
No. Wait. Give me the light ... no, nothing.

540
00:35:26,535 --> 00:35:28,933
Not you dare ask me ...
We are a team.

541
00:35:30,456 --> 00:35:32,454
I think it disappeared.

542
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:35,127
Honestly, that is
all very funny ...

543
00:35:35,128 --> 00:35:37,774
with these games that
we are preaching ...

544
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:39,597
Well, I do not know.

545
00:35:39,622 --> 00:35:42,219
Come on, do something.

546
00:35:43,843 --> 00:35:46,540
Have done before, do it again.

547
00:35:46,565 --> 00:35:49,062
Are you fucking scared?

548
00:35:53,682 --> 00:35:57,878
Jesus Christ. Forget it.

549
00:35:57,903 --> 00:36:02,299
Lance! Disappeared ...
is enjoying with us ...

550
00:36:02,324 --> 00:36:05,221
Shut up! Stop saying shit scenes.
Relax.

551
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,844
We could go home now?

552
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:11,764
Lance, some people try
answers all of life.

553
00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:12,988
Ok

554
00:36:13,412 --> 00:36:15,510
TC, what time is it?

555
00:36:15,535 --> 00:36:17,433
04:40

556
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:20,655
Let's go home.

557
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,675
Folks, we have footage that arrive.
Why do not we take everything and get out?

558
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,897
Let's go home.

559
00:36:27,922 --> 00:36:30,120
You have everything saved? Yes.

560
00:36:30,744 --> 00:36:33,442
I think it's right, up ahead.

561
00:36:35,465 --> 00:36:37,962
Are you sure?

562
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,985
Yes, that's all. That's all.

563
00:36:43,906 --> 00:36:48,401
Is this the way, right?
Shit, it's a dead end.

564
00:36:48,426 --> 00:36:50,125
Personal.

565
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,748
Shit.

566
00:36:51,773 --> 00:36:54,170
Not here.

567
00:36:54,195 --> 00:36:55,394
Come on, come on!

568
00:36:55,419 --> 00:36:59,215
Come on TC admits ...

569
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,638
What are applications?
We're not lost.

570
00:37:01,663 --> 00:37:04,859
We're not lost,
we came here ...

571
00:37:04,884 --> 00:37:10,678
Matt! Matt! We lost shovel.

572
00:37:10,703 --> 00:37:15,598
I need some information ...

573
00:37:17,122 --> 00:37:19,120
Why the hell is he not responding?

574
00:37:19,145 --> 00:37:21,742
I'm not going there. TC! Why?

575
00:37:21,767 --> 00:37:24,664
Because let's go back here.

576
00:37:24,689 --> 00:37:30,383
If we go in one direction,
'll get there ok?

577
00:37:30,408 --> 00:37:31,607
What? North?

578
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:34,779
I went around, and there
the corner is where

579
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,126
was the bathtub.
He knows where we are.

580
00:37:37,151 --> 00:37:40,847
've Been here since
TC were here.

581
00:37:40,872 --> 00:37:42,820
Explain to me when
saw this tub.

582
00:37:42,821 --> 00:37:44,768
Not the same bathtub!

583
00:37:44,793 --> 00:37:46,791
I know it is not.

584
00:37:46,816 --> 00:37:49,314
TC, get up, go.
He said six hours was not it?

585
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:52,535
You'll sleep here? Kenny is at 6 right?
I can not wait.

586
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,758
I can not wait, can not wait.

587
00:37:54,783 --> 00:37:56,881
I will not walk in darkness.
I can not wait.

588
00:38:03,799 --> 00:38:06,296
Where are they?

589
00:38:11,316 --> 00:38:13,814
Shit.

590
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:17,934
Where have you been?
Do not hear me calling you?

591
00:38:17,959 --> 00:38:21,855
* All the talk at the same time! *

592
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,377
We lost ourselves.
We do not hear the walkie-talkies?

593
00:38:25,402 --> 00:38:27,500
I do not hear the radio call?

594
00:38:27,525 --> 00:38:30,621
No, not heard. You hear? No.

595
00:38:30,646 --> 00:38:33,443
Because we locked Lance?

596
00:38:33,468 --> 00:38:35,766
Lance!

597
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:38,189
Because they had to lock
the fucking door?

598
00:38:38,214 --> 00:38:40,511
Holy shit!

599
00:38:40,536 --> 00:38:42,934
What are you seeing? What is it?

600
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:45,456
Her hair. Oh shit.

601
00:38:45,481 --> 00:38:48,178
Fuck.

602
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:49,752
I'll download it
to the computer.

603
00:38:49,753 --> 00:38:51,300
No, Matt, we do not have time.

604
00:38:51,325 --> 00:38:54,372
Take in the chambers
Still, all come together.

605
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:57,419
Guys, let's stand up
and begin to fix everything.

606
00:38:57,444 --> 00:38:59,242
Let's get ready to
when Kenny arrived.

607
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:01,864
Someone help me?
Please? No no.

608
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:04,187
I need everyone
down here, sorry.

609
00:39:04,212 --> 00:39:06,110
I know.

610
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,732
You have a radio? Yes, I have a radio.

611
00:39:08,757 --> 00:39:11,255
Working? I hope so.

612
00:39:11,256 --> 00:39:14,375
Do you hear that? Yes, that's great,

613
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,898
Be right back, okay? Ok man.

614
00:39:16,923 --> 00:39:19,520
Do not go without me.

615
00:39:28,736 --> 00:39:32,132
Okay, it's time to get out of here.

616
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:52,736
Fuck!

617
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,256
What the fuck!

618
00:40:05,773 --> 00:40:07,371
Lance, are you there?

619
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:16,387
Personally, I found something here.

620
00:40:17,111 --> 00:40:18,809
Hello!

621
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:23,729
Lance!

622
00:40:25,053 --> 00:40:26,252
Hello!

623
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:31,072
Guys, stop playing!

624
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:50,177
The morning is now approaching.

625
00:40:50,202 --> 00:40:53,299
We have not seen anything paranormal
this last hour.

626
00:40:53,324 --> 00:40:56,620
Grave Encounters,
I am Lance Preston.

627
00:40:57,445 --> 00:40:59,243
Again. No, we do not have ...

628
00:40:59,268 --> 00:41:01,266
Again.

629
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:05,287
Grave Encounters,
I am Lance Preston.

630
00:41:05,511 --> 00:41:09,008
That's all I have.
I can not do this anymore.

631
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:14,727
No matter, tomorrow with the light
the morning will be much better.

632
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,050
That sounds good.
Where is Matt, anyway?

633
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:19,672
Why is it taking so long?

634
00:41:19,697 --> 00:41:21,195
Matt?

635
00:41:22,918 --> 00:41:25,016
Matt? Are you there?

636
00:41:26,939 --> 00:41:28,837
Matt? Lance!

637
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:31,260
The radio was not working before.

638
00:41:33,882 --> 00:41:39,576
Personally, I know this
will sound stupid ...

639
00:41:39,601 --> 00:41:43,298
I'm the last person who wants
back to walk these halls

640
00:41:43,323 --> 00:41:47,718
It's dark, it can
have fallen and have been hurt.

641
00:41:47,743 --> 00:41:48,942
She's right, he may be hurt.

642
00:41:52,563 --> 00:41:55,660
Folks, we have to go look for the.
Very well.

643
00:41:55,685 --> 00:41:59,781
This is ridiculous. Let's look it up.

644
00:42:00,205 --> 00:42:03,602
TC takes the camera.
Sasha takes the camera. Why?

645
00:42:03,627 --> 00:42:06,923
If we do this is
good that shot it.

646
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:12,193
Thanks for your help.
Hey! By the way, not

647
00:42:12,194 --> 00:42:14,940
is easy to get here
alone, I tell you right now.

648
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:17,163
Jesus Christ.

649
00:42:17,987 --> 00:42:19,585
Matt!

650
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,497
Matt! Matt! Matt!

651
00:42:36,818 --> 00:42:38,915
What the fuck?

652
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,139
Shit!

653
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:47,756
Why is this shit
scattered all around?

654
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:49,480
Fuck.

655
00:42:54,899 --> 00:42:56,497
Okay, okay, okay.

656
00:42:56,522 --> 00:42:57,521
Why he left
the equipment here?

657
00:42:57,522 --> 00:42:58,520
Should not have done.

658
00:42:58,545 --> 00:43:02,941
He should be tidying up.
He must be here somewhere.

659
00:43:02,966 --> 00:43:05,863
TC going there, Sasha
and I will go here.

660
00:43:05,888 --> 00:43:08,685
Why we do this?
It is a terrible idea.

661
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:11,607
He has to be here, not
would leave things around ...

662
00:43:11,632 --> 00:43:14,329
Sasha comes to me.
TC goes by that side.

663
00:43:17,251 --> 00:43:21,547
This looks like my room after
arguing with my girl!

664
00:43:21,572 --> 00:43:24,768
Matt, where are you man?
I want to go home, that's enough!

665
00:43:24,793 --> 00:43:27,291
Have we scared you are!

666
00:43:27,316 --> 00:43:29,514
I am looking for cigarettes.

667
00:43:32,136 --> 00:43:33,834
Come on, Matt!

668
00:43:33,859 --> 00:43:35,557
Not funny man.

669
00:43:42,675 --> 00:43:44,373
It will take the horns.

670
00:43:54,588 --> 00:43:56,586
Matt! Come on, buddy!

671
00:43:56,611 --> 00:43:59,008
Look what my wife will kill me!

672
00:43:59,033 --> 00:44:03,928
It's late! Come on man.

673
00:44:03,953 --> 00:44:05,951
You better be dead
than to die.

674
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:12,270
Matt. I'm not kidding! Where are you?

675
00:44:12,295 --> 00:44:13,993
What the fuck?!

676
00:44:32,499 --> 00:44:34,497
Lance! Sasha!

677
00:44:34,522 --> 00:44:37,119
Shit! What happened, what happened?

678
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,241
What, what? No, no.

679
00:44:42,064 --> 00:44:42,763
You okay man?

680
00:44:42,788 --> 00:44:44,786
Raise me. What?

681
00:44:44,811 --> 00:44:46,509
Raise me.

682
00:44:50,306 --> 00:44:52,004
I swear, someone ...

683
00:44:53,128 --> 00:44:54,826
I was pushed ok?

684
00:44:54,851 --> 00:44:56,649
Someone pushed me fucking!

685
00:44:56,674 --> 00:44:59,821
I was on the stairs, the
Matt's looking, I looked

686
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,968
down, and something pushed me
was breaking the neck.

687
00:45:02,993 --> 00:45:05,090
Oh my God.
I looked back and there was nothing there.

688
00:45:05,115 --> 00:45:09,211
These are things to enjoy with us.
It has been like this all night

689
00:45:09,236 --> 00:45:11,234
Call him! Call Kenny!
What are you waiting for?

690
00:45:11,259 --> 00:45:13,157
Okay, okay!

691
00:45:13,182 --> 00:45:15,480
League now. I'll call ok? Take it easy.

692
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:17,403
Jesus Christ.

693
00:45:17,428 --> 00:45:20,225
Are you okay? No, I'm fine!

694
00:45:22,048 --> 00:45:24,845
Holy shit!

695
00:45:26,369 --> 00:45:30,265
I have no network, your attempt.

696
00:45:35,484 --> 00:45:37,282
Good!

697
00:45:37,307 --> 00:45:38,506
Good shit!

698
00:45:42,727 --> 00:45:44,924
What the hell are you doing TC?

699
00:45:44,949 --> 00:45:47,347
What do you think I'm doing?
Come help me.

700
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:50,669
You can not break the door! Then see!

701
00:45:50,694 --> 00:45:54,689
We can not damage the building,
we are responsible for this.

702
00:45:54,714 --> 00:45:56,612
Wait! The man can not see shit!

703
00:45:57,836 --> 00:46:00,034
Then shovel?

704
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:01,258
This will go out of your paycheck!

705
00:46:01,283 --> 00:46:03,181
You think I care? No!

706
00:46:03,206 --> 00:46:04,404
Shit man!

707
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:07,326
I'm sick of this shit,
want to go home

708
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:11,547
I lie down and sleep.

709
00:46:11,572 --> 00:46:14,669
This program is your only man.

710
00:46:14,694 --> 00:46:15,893
Put the fucking camera on the floor

711
00:46:15,918 --> 00:46:16,417
and help me.

712
00:46:19,739 --> 00:46:21,037
Help me.

713
00:46:21,062 --> 00:46:22,261
Ok

714
00:46:24,384 --> 00:46:25,583
Ok

715
00:46:25,608 --> 00:46:28,505
Need my help? No.

716
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,528
We're fine.

717
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:34,848
Shit, the three ok?

718
00:46:34,873 --> 00:46:39,269
One, two, three ...

719
00:46:41,491 --> 00:46:44,189
Fuck!

720
00:46:44,513 --> 00:46:46,711
Are you pushing? Yes I am.

721
00:46:46,736 --> 00:46:51,132
One, two, three ...

722
00:46:56,951 --> 00:46:58,849
What the fuck?!

723
00:47:00,472 --> 00:47:03,769
No, this is the fucking entry!

724
00:47:03,794 --> 00:47:04,992
This entry is the shit!

725
00:47:07,914 --> 00:47:10,112
We got here right?

726
00:47:10,137 --> 00:47:12,535
Yes, this is the entrance.

727
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,758
This is not right.

728
00:47:13,783 --> 00:47:15,282
This is impossible.

729
00:47:15,307 --> 00:47:18,903
It was here that we got right?

730
00:47:19,028 --> 00:47:21,026
It was here that brought things.

731
00:47:21,051 --> 00:47:23,348
This makes no sense.

732
00:47:25,871 --> 00:47:28,368
Makes no sense.

733
00:47:28,393 --> 00:47:30,591
It was here we come.

734
00:47:30,616 --> 00:47:32,914
It's just a hallway ...
I do not know ...

735
00:47:32,939 --> 00:47:36,835
He should have gone to get around, should
on the other side of the building.

736
00:47:38,258 --> 00:47:40,456
Lance!

737
00:47:45,676 --> 00:47:46,874
Lance!

738
00:47:49,297 --> 00:47:51,694
Are the same ports.

739
00:47:53,817 --> 00:47:56,215
I'm getting tired of this staff.

740
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,537
Yes!

741
00:47:58,562 --> 00:48:01,859
Houston, hold it.
Hold that, please.

742
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,279
Be careful with your leg
careful with your leg!

743
00:48:06,304 --> 00:48:09,301
Shut up, you stay where you only the
look and not do anything!

744
00:48:09,326 --> 00:48:10,525
Okay, okay!

745
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,548
What's wrong with you?

746
00:48:12,573 --> 00:48:15,070
One, two, three ...

747
00:48:25,884 --> 00:48:27,583
Fuck!

748
00:48:29,705 --> 00:48:33,202
What is there to say?
What's up Cock?

749
00:48:33,227 --> 00:48:35,824
Perhaps this is the way
for the emergency exit.

750
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:37,048
Houston shut the fuck up shit!

751
00:48:37,073 --> 00:48:38,272
Shut the fuck up shit!

752
00:48:38,696 --> 00:48:40,894
This, you see?

753
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:42,118
Move over.

754
00:48:42,143 --> 00:48:44,840
This work is man!

755
00:48:46,463 --> 00:48:48,261
Go la ... You did?

756
00:48:48,986 --> 00:48:50,284
Give me a minute ok?

757
00:48:52,507 --> 00:48:56,303
Oh fuck!
We are here fucking locked!

758
00:48:57,027 --> 00:49:00,124
Let's get a tool.
We try to take the bars.

759
00:49:00,149 --> 00:49:04,944
I have a toolbox.
But it's in the bag, out there!

760
00:49:04,969 --> 00:49:07,866
There was you who wanted to lock in?

761
00:49:07,891 --> 00:49:09,989
Fucking amazing idea!

762
00:49:10,513 --> 00:49:14,210
Obviously all
windows have bars.

763
00:49:14,235 --> 00:49:18,231
No, no! The window up there!
There was no bar do you?

764
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:19,654
We go there.

765
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:21,877
Come have my faith!

766
00:49:22,401 --> 00:49:24,899
What time is it Sasha?

767
00:49:24,924 --> 00:49:26,122
8:44

768
00:49:26,147 --> 00:49:27,346
You gotta be fucking kidding me!

769
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:30,418
I spotted you fucking? Got it?!

770
00:49:30,419 --> 00:49:33,465
8:44 pa are!
I have an audition tomorrow!

771
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:35,688
Nobody cares to you
or with your fucking

772
00:49:35,689 --> 00:49:37,885
nor with the career
hearing your shit!

773
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:39,609
Guys, let me
think for a minute!

774
00:49:39,634 --> 00:49:42,131
It makes no sense, it's all fucked!

775
00:49:42,156 --> 00:49:44,553
I checked the time of
Sunrise last night.

776
00:49:44,578 --> 00:49:46,576
What are you trying to say shit?

777
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:51,297
Should begin to be
clear from the 7:45.

778
00:49:53,819 --> 00:49:56,117
But it's still night.

779
00:49:56,641 --> 00:49:59,838
Still is the night ...
makes no sense!

780
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:01,761
There's no joke man.

781
00:50:01,786 --> 00:50:03,184
Shut up!

782
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,408
It makes no sense.

783
00:50:04,433 --> 00:50:09,828
Get them out of this building! Please!
Somebody help us!

784
00:50:11,151 --> 00:50:17,645
Ok ok. Ok let's be rational?
A building is old right?

785
00:50:17,669 --> 00:50:21,166
It is an old building can
to be an anomaly

786
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:24,662
power that made the mess
our clocks fastest ...

787
00:50:24,687 --> 00:50:29,482
So if this does not
this would be hours yet.

788
00:50:29,507 --> 00:50:31,206
This would explain why
it is still dark,

789
00:50:31,207 --> 00:50:32,904
and why Kenny
has not yet appeared.

790
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:35,426
Electric anomaly!
That idea sucks!

791
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:38,348
Why come to the
your ideas of rationalism?

792
00:50:38,373 --> 00:50:41,370
This is not an audition for any of the
your science fiction movies!

793
00:50:41,395 --> 00:50:42,794
There is nothing rational here.

794
00:50:42,795 --> 00:50:44,192
It is as rational as
anything else here.

795
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:12,488
I checked my phone e. ..

796
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,808
And mark 13:12 hours.

797
00:51:19,131 --> 00:51:22,428
Is 13:12 pm

798
00:51:23,951 --> 00:51:29,146
I do not think is right.
But I think that occurred to me ...

799
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:33,666
I do not know. They are all
are so tired

800
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:37,363
to take a nap.
Are taking a break.

801
00:51:38,786 --> 00:51:40,984
Let's wait until Kenny appears.

802
00:51:43,307 --> 00:51:46,903
I do not know how he
we will find.

803
00:51:46,928 --> 00:51:48,127
Makes no sense.

804
00:51:51,548 --> 00:51:53,746
I have not slept for about 20 hours.

805
00:51:55,669 --> 00:52:02,162
I'll stop now for a bit e. ..
I take a nap.

806
00:52:32,356 --> 00:52:34,254
What the fuck?!

807
00:52:36,477 --> 00:52:38,375
Houston, what is your problem man?

808
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,497
It was not me!
What are you doing, man?

809
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,817
What happened?
Oh my God!

810
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:52,136
Someone or something just
from our lights.

811
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,857
We are in total darkness.
All we

812
00:52:55,858 --> 00:52:58,355
remains are the lanterns and
the lights of the cameras.

813
00:52:58,379 --> 00:53:01,776
What a waste.
I checked my phone.

814
00:53:01,801 --> 00:53:03,699
St. 8 pm.

815
00:53:03,924 --> 00:53:07,021
We slept for 7 hours.

816
00:53:07,046 --> 00:53:09,543
The TC was going to eat a sandwich e. ??..

817
00:53:09,568 --> 00:53:11,166
They have to see it.

818
00:53:17,385 --> 00:53:20,482
Lance! It smells bad
shut that shit!

819
00:53:20,507 --> 00:53:23,703
What are you doing? Close it there!

820
00:53:26,725 --> 00:53:30,122
All our food is so but
we still have plenty of water so ...

821
00:53:30,347 --> 00:53:32,445
I do not know, we should be fine.

822
00:53:35,566 --> 00:53:38,164
Why not try to go through the tunnels?

823
00:53:38,189 --> 00:53:41,385
Kenny said that the tunnels
unite all the buildings.

824
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:43,608
Maybe we can find a
Output in other buildings.

825
00:53:43,633 --> 00:53:45,531
You see the Great Wall of China?

826
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:49,352
I'm not going to the tunnels ...
If the lights go out we're fucked.

827
00:53:49,377 --> 00:53:52,374
Remember when you asked me
to record the sunset?

828
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:54,946
I saw a fire exit.
If we ascend to the roof,

829
00:53:54,947 --> 00:53:57,494
maybe we can go down the
climbing and general merchandise here.

830
00:53:57,619 --> 00:54:00,066
So how?
We will stay here or ...

831
00:54:00,067 --> 00:54:02,514
I do not care what we
only do we get out of here man!

832
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:06,634
I do not want to be here.
Guys, want to do all this?

833
00:54:06,659 --> 00:54:08,657
On the roof! Okay, okay!

834
00:54:08,682 --> 00:54:11,779
Let's get the equipment
whole, and let's go.

835
00:54:13,702 --> 00:54:16,399
Give me a little personal light.
Sorry.

836
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:22,618
Let's here?

837
00:54:22,643 --> 00:54:24,741
Lance? Where? No, no, no!

838
00:54:24,766 --> 00:54:27,013
TC said you knew where it was.

839
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:29,261
I said nothing!
Do not put the blame on me.

840
00:54:29,286 --> 00:54:33,582
I do not know where it was said.
I said I had stairs.

841
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:35,854
What does that
matter now?

842
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:38,102
That's why we came.
I saw the outside.

843
00:54:38,127 --> 00:54:39,326
Ok! Fuck!

844
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:42,847
I can not do it guys!

845
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:47,467
What the fuck was that?!

846
00:54:47,692 --> 00:54:49,590
Hello! Someone up here?

847
00:54:50,115 --> 00:54:51,913
TC! Is there?

848
00:54:52,014 --> 00:54:54,334
I do not ask questions.
Stairs or not?

849
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:55,658
Let's get together.

850
00:54:56,782 --> 00:54:58,630
Listen, keep the light
connected in front of me.

851
00:54:58,631 --> 00:55:00,478
Move it, move it go!

852
00:55:00,503 --> 00:55:03,800
Get out of my fucking face!
Out of my way!

853
00:55:04,924 --> 00:55:06,122
Wait guys! Slowly.

854
00:55:06,147 --> 00:55:08,145
What's wrong with you man?

855
00:55:10,768 --> 00:55:13,665
Yes! Yes! (Access to roof)

856
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,881
No way!

857
00:55:21,906 --> 00:55:24,903
Shut up and secure it. I see!

858
00:55:29,623 --> 00:55:32,221
It's solid ass!

859
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:35,242
What do you think?
It seems that there is a long time?

860
00:55:35,267 --> 00:55:37,465
Makes no sense.

861
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:39,988
Fuck!

862
00:55:40,512 --> 00:55:43,709
The fucking camera away from me!

863
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:50,227
What do you think? I do not know, I do not know.

864
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:07,934
Just left of the stairs.
Was completely sealed at the top!

865
00:56:07,959 --> 00:56:10,456
I will document this
all, when we leave

866
00:56:10,457 --> 00:56:12,954
here, people will
want to see it.

867
00:56:15,576 --> 00:56:19,472
See it!
Here we climbed the stairs, right?

868
00:56:19,497 --> 00:56:21,195
This puts us on the 4th floor.

869
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:24,817
We came here, we
be here at least, right?

870
00:56:24,842 --> 00:56:26,540
Are you sure? I do not know ...

871
00:56:26,565 --> 00:56:28,363
TC, this ... Lance! Lance!

872
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:29,587
What, what?

873
00:56:30,211 --> 00:56:33,807
We are here? Can not ...
Nor is there stairs!

874
00:56:33,832 --> 00:56:35,830
It means nothing.

875
00:56:35,831 --> 00:56:37,828
This means that
we are on the 1st floor.

876
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:41,849
Remember that we
we came here right?

877
00:56:42,773 --> 00:56:47,968
TC, can you film it?
Yes, I'm shooting.

878
00:56:47,993 --> 00:56:49,891
This is so fucked!

879
00:56:50,715 --> 00:56:54,211
Fuck! What, what?

880
00:56:54,236 --> 00:56:56,035
What the fuck? Did you hear that?

881
00:56:56,059 --> 00:56:58,357
Did you hear? What the fuck was that?

882
00:56:58,981 --> 00:57:02,278
What is this? Matt? Matt?

883
00:57:04,301 --> 00:57:07,098
Fuck! Matt! On this side!

884
00:57:10,819 --> 00:57:13,117
Matt, are you?

885
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:19,036
Staff will return! Matt!

886
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:22,058
Not here. Not here!

887
00:57:23,581 --> 00:57:25,279
That just move?!

888
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,798
Let's fuck out of here!

889
00:58:01,093 --> 00:58:03,990
We had all day to try
find a ladder.

890
00:58:06,612 --> 00:58:09,309
I do not know.
We could not find any.

891
00:58:09,334 --> 00:58:10,533
This building is a maze of shit!

892
00:58:11,857 --> 00:58:13,955
That's what the TC says. It is as if this

893
00:58:13,956 --> 00:58:16,052
will always
change around us.

894
00:58:18,575 --> 00:58:21,572
We have not yet
find Matt.

895
00:58:21,597 --> 00:58:24,494
I do not know if he is okay.

896
00:58:24,519 --> 00:58:27,715
We should not be seeing so much shit!

897
00:58:32,835 --> 00:58:39,129
We are all tired, hungry.
We are trying to sleep again.

898
00:58:40,253 --> 00:58:42,850
This time we are sleeping in shifts.

899
00:58:43,274 --> 00:58:45,572
So it can always be one to watch.

900
00:58:51,891 --> 00:58:54,887
TC, you're writing? Yes.

901
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,608
We rise now.
You should see this!

902
00:58:59,633 --> 00:59:01,031
Off the fucking camera!

903
00:59:01,056 --> 00:59:02,753
Come Sasha!
We have to document everything.

904
00:59:02,778 --> 00:59:04,077
People have to see it.

905
00:59:04,102 --> 00:59:05,301
Caution! Caution!

906
00:59:07,224 --> 00:59:09,721
Sasha, we will take it,
you have to understand ...

907
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:11,594
It is impossible for anyone
have come here and

908
00:59:11,595 --> 00:59:13,442
have done it without us
We give for nothing.

909
00:59:14,366 --> 00:59:16,364
Cut! Cut shovel there.

910
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:18,587
Matt!

911
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:22,009
I swear I heard.

912
00:59:22,034 --> 00:59:23,232
Matt!

913
00:59:24,956 --> 00:59:26,454
Hello!

914
00:59:26,879 --> 00:59:31,574
See? I told you that was
fucking heard! Alive.

915
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,497
Matt! Are you okay?

916
00:59:34,521 --> 00:59:36,519
Can you hear me?

917
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:40,240
I'm frozen!

918
00:59:46,658 --> 00:59:49,256
Tell us where you are alone.
We'll pick you up!

919
00:59:52,078 --> 00:59:53,876
Shit!

920
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:55,100
No longer there!

921
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:56,623
We have to find it.

922
00:59:56,648 --> 00:59:58,246
How do we find the
if not managed

923
00:59:58,247 --> 00:59:59,845
find your way
to the front door?

924
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:03,266
We should not be far off.
These walkie-talkies are a shit.

925
01:00:05,489 --> 01:00:07,687
How do you know what is it?

926
01:00:10,809 --> 01:00:14,105
Matt! Are you here?

927
01:00:15,229 --> 01:00:18,426
Sorry, sorry, sorry! Fuck!

928
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:21,548
Matt! We hear you!
Where are you? Fuck!

929
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:25,968
Sasha tries in all
frequencies.

930
01:00:25,969 --> 01:00:27,866
This is weak, has no
that much reach.

931
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:30,588
How far is that
what was said?

932
01:00:30,589 --> 01:00:32,187
I did not say, was not
specifications.

933
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:37,506
Estimate? 200-300-400?
200 meters to get a clear sound.

934
01:00:37,531 --> 01:00:39,429
Maybe 300 meters ...
We will continue to walk.

935
01:00:39,454 --> 01:00:41,052
Before starting to cause noise.

936
01:00:41,077 --> 01:00:42,276
Stay together, come on.

937
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,598
It's a dead end!
A dead end.

938
01:00:53,515 --> 01:00:55,613
Where are you fucking?

939
01:01:05,727 --> 01:01:07,625
Listen people this is
completely useless right?

940
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:10,148
If it were to find it ...
the scope ...

941
01:01:10,173 --> 01:01:11,371
Fuck!

942
01:01:11,996 --> 01:01:12,895
What the fuck was that?!

943
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,119
It was Matt!

944
01:01:21,536 --> 01:01:23,634
What are you doing, man?

945
01:01:27,755 --> 01:01:29,852
Lance! Lance!

946
01:01:31,476 --> 01:01:32,674
Oh fuck!

947
01:01:39,293 --> 01:01:41,391
Do something man.

948
01:01:41,915 --> 01:01:42,914
Lance! Lance!

949
01:01:47,534 --> 01:01:50,032
Who are you? What are you doing here?

950
01:02:07,439 --> 01:02:10,536
Turn off the light! Turn off the light!

951
01:02:12,359 --> 01:02:14,157
Have you seen the fucking her face?!

952
01:02:14,182 --> 01:02:15,381
Shut your fucking mouth!

953
01:02:15,406 --> 01:02:16,604
Have you seen the fucking her face!?

954
01:02:24,321 --> 01:02:27,218
Why is this happening?
Oh my God!

955
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,136
Shit! Shit!

956
01:02:34,161 --> 01:02:38,257
We are lost!
Houston lost the fucking!

957
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,779
Matt!

958
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:50,295
Guys!

959
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,519
Guys!

960
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:56,738
Sasha!

961
01:03:06,753 --> 01:03:08,351
TC!

962
01:03:11,673 --> 01:03:13,271
Lance!

963
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,557
Is anybody there?!

964
01:04:19,353 --> 01:04:21,152
Help me! Guys!

965
01:04:47,949 --> 01:04:49,847
We are here today.

966
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:53,368
The Houston disappeared.

967
01:04:55,192 --> 01:04:58,988
Matt wanted to find the
radio but he does not respond.

968
01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:02,909
What the fuck was that?

969
01:05:04,132 --> 01:05:07,629
Just go to weird shit
around us. Fuck!

970
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:13,248
I do not know how long it will last.

971
01:05:16,869 --> 01:05:19,067
We are not alone.

972
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:27,184
My name is on the bracelet!

973
01:05:27,209 --> 01:05:29,007
How is my name
is in the band?!

974
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:30,805
Fuck!

975
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:35,325
First scratches on
my back and now ...

976
01:05:37,149 --> 01:05:38,747
What the fuck!

977
01:05:38,772 --> 01:05:40,320
When we wake,
we had one of these ...

978
01:05:40,321 --> 01:05:41,869
have to do this.

979
01:05:41,894 --> 01:05:42,793
Fuck you!

980
01:05:44,616 --> 01:05:49,811
You wanted to get out of there was not?
I did not want!

981
01:05:49,835 --> 01:05:52,533
Vieste is not it? I did not want!

982
01:05:52,558 --> 01:05:54,556
That's it! What an idiot!

983
01:05:54,581 --> 01:05:57,677
What does this mean?
It means we're fucked.

984
01:05:57,702 --> 01:05:58,901
Get it? It is what it means.

985
01:05:59,825 --> 01:06:01,523
This is crazy.

986
01:06:01,548 --> 01:06:03,447
This is crazy shit!

987
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:29,145
Do not look! Jesus Christ!

988
01:06:33,965 --> 01:06:35,564
What the fuck?!

989
01:06:39,485 --> 01:06:42,082
Is there something! What the fuck?

990
01:06:47,901 --> 01:06:49,599
Enough already!

991
01:06:49,624 --> 01:06:51,722
It is as if we walked in circles.

992
01:06:55,443 --> 01:06:58,640
Still can not find
or Matt Houston.

993
01:06:58,665 --> 01:07:01,662
Stop it! What do you mean, stop what?

994
01:07:01,687 --> 01:07:03,685
Are you kidding?
Fuck more to your program!

995
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:06,107
I am not part of it ... I just ...

996
01:07:06,132 --> 01:07:09,129
I'm just documenting ok?
People will want to see this!

997
01:07:09,154 --> 01:07:15,048
Matt disappeared and the Houston right?
We have to focus on out of here

998
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:16,172
and find them.

999
01:07:16,596 --> 01:07:20,393
And you're still doing that shit!

1000
01:07:20,417 --> 01:07:22,116
Okay folks, let's stop a bit.

1001
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:23,939
I just ...

1002
01:07:25,762 --> 01:07:27,360
Fuck it, let's bazaar!

1003
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:37,075
You can not run faster?
Let's fuck!

1004
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,198
Oh my God! Come on!

1005
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:41,121
No, no, no, no! Arise!

1006
01:07:41,146 --> 01:07:42,844
Are you crazy?! Arise!

1007
01:07:43,369 --> 01:07:45,067
Arise!

1008
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:50,187
I can not, I can not! You know!

1009
01:07:50,212 --> 01:07:54,208
Arise, Arise!
I know, I know.

1010
01:07:54,233 --> 01:07:57,030
Go recovers. Do what you have to do!

1011
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:59,852
We must continue on!

1012
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:03,773
Damn! What, what?

1013
01:08:03,798 --> 01:08:05,696
I found something! Come here!

1014
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:08,818
That are waiting for fucking? Come on!

1015
01:08:08,843 --> 01:08:09,942
Look!

1016
01:08:12,064 --> 01:08:15,061
Matt? Is he right? I do not know man!

1017
01:08:18,483 --> 01:08:20,781
Matt, get up!

1018
01:08:22,903 --> 01:08:24,901
So you close
shit the room!

1019
01:08:33,617 --> 01:08:37,613
Man, to the jokes!
Matt are you okay?

1020
01:08:38,537 --> 01:08:39,237
Oh fuck!

1021
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:45,655
The patient has some kind
phobia in childhood.

1022
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,978
Matt! Oh my God!

1023
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,798
Arise! Let's go!

1024
01:08:52,823 --> 01:08:55,320
Come on, get up!

1025
01:08:55,345 --> 01:08:57,842
Let us take you back!

1026
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,065
Come on! Here, here!

1027
01:09:00,190 --> 01:09:01,389
Come on!

1028
01:09:03,711 --> 01:09:06,009
Put him in bed, leave it there.

1029
01:09:06,034 --> 01:09:08,332
You see anything? No, we're fine.

1030
01:09:10,954 --> 01:09:13,951
Where were you?
Where did you get those clothes?

1031
01:09:15,774 --> 01:09:19,970
Damn, talk with us!
Look at his wrist.

1032
01:09:19,995 --> 01:09:21,193
Matt? Matt?

1033
01:09:25,414 --> 01:09:27,312
How did these wounds?

1034
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:34,829
Matt! What they'll do?
What did you see?

1035
01:09:36,453 --> 01:09:39,350
I'm sick of this!
We have to leave.

1036
01:09:42,572 --> 01:09:44,919
Yes of course we can leave.
We can go.

1037
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,267
When we are better.

1038
01:09:47,491 --> 01:09:50,389
What? What do you mean
"When we are better"?

1039
01:09:50,413 --> 01:09:52,212
What the fuck does that mean?

1040
01:09:53,935 --> 01:09:55,933
I was not ready.

1041
01:09:57,456 --> 01:09:59,854
The process is slow. But the patient
was responding to treatment.

1042
01:09:59,879 --> 01:10:01,877
He's crazy.
Must be stoned or so.

1043
01:10:01,878 --> 01:10:03,875
Not to say
make sense.

1044
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,397
TC! Shut up! Do not tell me to shut up.

1045
01:10:09,319 --> 01:10:12,216
Do not be sad it's okay.

1046
01:10:18,235 --> 01:10:20,433
It will help you too.

1047
01:10:26,851 --> 01:10:28,250
Oh my God!

1048
01:10:29,973 --> 01:10:32,470
TC! Go check the door!
I've done it.

1049
01:10:32,495 --> 01:10:33,694
Go on!

1050
01:10:33,719 --> 01:10:37,915
Come on man.
Make sure that nothing is here!

1051
01:10:46,431 --> 01:10:48,629
We found Matt.

1052
01:10:50,252 --> 01:10:52,350
It's completely fucked.

1053
01:11:03,963 --> 01:11:05,961
The TC is still here with us.

1054
01:11:05,986 --> 01:11:07,784
What?

1055
01:11:07,809 --> 01:11:11,206
It's okay.
What are you doing?

1056
01:11:25,416 --> 01:11:27,913
I do not feel well.

1057
01:11:29,637 --> 01:11:31,435
There is something wrong with me.

1058
01:11:39,452 --> 01:11:42,748
Yes, you're a bit hot.
You must have a fever.

1059
01:11:47,368 --> 01:11:49,366
It takes a lot of water. Thank you.

1060
01:11:49,391 --> 01:11:51,589
Get some sleep. I can not sleep.

1061
01:11:56,509 --> 01:11:59,806
And I think we'll ever get.

1062
01:12:04,726 --> 01:12:06,624
What the hell was this?

1063
01:12:06,649 --> 01:12:07,847
Jesus!

1064
01:12:14,965 --> 01:12:17,463
Come on!

1065
01:12:22,283 --> 01:12:25,080
Come on ... go!

1066
01:12:25,804 --> 01:12:27,502
Quick, here!

1067
01:12:59,195 --> 01:13:01,692
You see anything? What is it?

1068
01:13:02,616 --> 01:13:05,513
There is blood in the bathtub!
There is blood in the bathtub!

1069
01:13:05,538 --> 01:13:07,636
What? Come on!

1070
01:13:07,661 --> 01:13:09,459
We go where man? Come on!

1071
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:15,578
What the fuck?!

1072
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:19,898
Matt? Matt?

1073
01:13:19,923 --> 01:13:22,421
What do these fucking?
TC! Stay away from the bathtub.

1074
01:13:22,446 --> 01:13:24,044
Come on Matt!

1075
01:13:24,069 --> 01:13:25,967
TC! What is it
Cock is doing?

1076
01:13:26,691 --> 01:13:28,190
Fuck, I do not know!

1077
01:13:32,111 --> 01:13:34,309
Oh my God! Oh my God!

1078
01:13:35,832 --> 01:13:37,530
Help me! Help me!

1079
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:39,653
Turn the tub!

1080
01:13:48,369 --> 01:13:49,768
Gone!

1081
01:13:49,993 --> 01:13:51,391
Gone!

1082
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:53,814
Fucking disappeared!

1083
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:56,336
Suddenly gone! Without a trace!

1084
01:15:08,687 --> 01:15:10,685
Shit! No, no!

1085
01:15:16,803 --> 01:15:18,801
It is a lift!

1086
01:15:19,326 --> 01:15:21,224
Open it! Open it!

1087
01:15:21,449 --> 01:15:23,047
Open it! Open it!

1088
01:15:28,267 --> 01:15:30,165
It's just the echo of the elevator.

1089
01:15:30,689 --> 01:15:32,437
If we reach
tunnels, perhaps

1090
01:15:32,438 --> 01:15:34,186
can get out by
other building.

1091
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:42,502
Go there!

1092
01:15:42,727 --> 01:15:44,225
Fuck! Fuck!

1093
01:15:45,849 --> 01:15:51,842
Hear! Watch out Matt,
I'll get some tools.

1094
01:15:52,667 --> 01:15:54,964
Stay here.

1095
01:16:34,249 --> 01:16:35,747
What the fuck is that?

1096
01:16:38,769 --> 01:16:40,667
Jesus! It is a language? Fuck!

1097
01:17:00,172 --> 01:17:03,469
What's up? What's up?

1098
01:17:10,187 --> 01:17:11,685
Bring the light, points to there.

1099
01:17:14,508 --> 01:17:17,405
Here is a ladder. Head down.

1100
01:17:18,628 --> 01:17:20,027
How do we take Matt?

1101
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:22,749
I'll go first and you come
then with Matt ok?

1102
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:29,168
Get away! It is back there.

1103
01:17:29,992 --> 01:17:31,790
Lance! Lance!

1104
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:42,204
Where is the button?

1105
01:17:43,528 --> 01:17:44,727
Oh here it is!

1106
01:18:32,602 --> 01:18:34,201
Is gone?

1107
01:18:35,225 --> 01:18:36,923
I do not know, disappeared.

1108
01:18:37,947 --> 01:18:40,444
Ok ok. Let's go.

1109
01:18:44,665 --> 01:18:46,863
Where is he? Matt!

1110
01:18:49,785 --> 01:18:51,883
Jesus! He jumped! He jumped!

1111
01:19:22,077 --> 01:19:23,275
Come on!

1112
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,598
Relax. You're done!

1113
01:19:31,917 --> 01:19:34,314
It's okay. It's okay.

1114
01:19:47,725 --> 01:19:49,024
The tunnels are here!

1115
01:19:50,747 --> 01:19:53,345
Finally we arrived.

1116
01:19:53,769 --> 01:19:56,966
I can not. I can not go.

1117
01:19:56,991 --> 01:19:58,789
Come on, Sasha!

1118
01:19:58,814 --> 01:20:01,411
Kenny said that connected
all buildings.

1119
01:20:02,135 --> 01:20:03,534
You have to do this to me.

1120
01:20:03,759 --> 01:20:05,657
I can not do this alone!
Ok? Ok

1121
01:20:11,476 --> 01:20:13,973
It is close to me and let's here.

1122
01:20:16,296 --> 01:20:18,194
Should not be too far away.

1123
01:20:25,412 --> 01:20:26,710
Okay, off you go.

1124
01:20:33,528 --> 01:20:37,724
No, no! We've already been here!

1125
01:20:39,547 --> 01:20:42,144
We should not be here! What the fuck?!

1126
01:20:47,764 --> 01:20:49,462
I can not go!

1127
01:20:51,585 --> 01:20:53,183
Wait a minute!

1128
01:21:16,584 --> 01:21:19,081
I want my mother!

1129
01:21:37,488 --> 01:21:38,986
It's day ...

1130
01:21:39,511 --> 01:21:41,508
What day is today?

1131
01:21:45,130 --> 01:21:48,127
I do not know what day it is.

1132
01:21:48,651 --> 01:21:50,999
We spent the whole day
walking in one direction.

1133
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,346
We did not get anywhere.

1134
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:57,367
It pains me much to leg.

1135
01:21:57,392 --> 01:22:02,787
Sasha could.
It will not be able to continue.

1136
01:22:07,107 --> 01:22:08,805
Who's there?

1137
01:22:09,729 --> 01:22:11,428
Who are you?

1138
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:14,188
Sasha?

1139
01:23:24,303 --> 01:23:25,901
Sasha, where are you?

1140
01:23:25,926 --> 01:23:26,925
Where are you?

1141
01:23:52,624 --> 01:23:54,322
Fuck!

1142
01:24:01,839 --> 01:24:04,037
What do you want?

1143
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:11,854
What do you want?

1144
01:24:34,356 --> 01:24:37,153
I'm running out
battery bit by bit.

1145
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:42,672
Now, I can only connect
lights when needed.

1146
01:24:44,595 --> 01:24:46,893
But I do not need more light!

1147
01:24:49,915 --> 01:24:52,013
Just me walking straight ahead.

1148
01:24:54,136 --> 01:24:56,333
He could continue to walk for hours.

1149
01:24:58,556 --> 01:25:00,155
It's like a game.

1150
01:25:07,272 --> 01:25:09,070
How far can you go?

1151
01:25:10,794 --> 01:25:12,792
If someone is watching this ...

1152
01:25:14,515 --> 01:25:15,714
Fuck you!

1153
01:25:20,034 --> 01:25:21,233
Fuck you!

1154
01:25:22,057 --> 01:25:23,655
Fuck you, fuck!

1155
01:25:25,578 --> 01:25:27,476
This was for you.

1156
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:31,236
Do not you hear anything? Do not you hear anything?

1157
01:26:31,261 --> 01:26:33,059
Do not you hear anything?

1158
01:26:36,381 --> 01:26:38,978
I'm alive!

1159
01:26:44,398 --> 01:26:46,795
I woke up e. ..

1160
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:50,217
I do not know how long
I was sleeping but ...

1161
01:26:50,941 --> 01:26:52,839
There is a door!

1162
01:26:52,864 --> 01:26:55,062
Look!

1163
01:27:43,137 --> 01:27:44,935
This is not happening.

1164
01:27:47,058 --> 01:27:48,457
This is not happening.

1165
01:27:51,579 --> 01:27:53,477
I must be crazy!

1166
01:28:58,035 --> 01:28:59,734
Jesus!

1167
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:29,028
It is not possible!

1168
01:29:43,339 --> 01:29:46,036
No! I'm not crazy!

1169
01:29:46,061 --> 01:29:49,957
I'm not loco! No! No! No!

1170
01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:04,267
I'm so much better now!

1171
01:30:07,589 --> 01:30:08,788
Finally, I can go home!

1172
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:19,002
Grave Encounters. I'm Lance Preston.

1173
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:24,621
Cut!

 


9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
