3
00:00:21,127 --> 00:00:23,125
My name is Jerrod Hartfelder.

4
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:27,345
I turn a video production company.
Here in California.

5
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,867
We focus primarily in-
on reality shows.

6
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:36,687
If you ever seen the show, "Tornado
Trackers, "is one of ours.

7
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:40,608
A club came to us by mail.

8
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:43,429
It was an episode of a reality show
new called "Grave Encounters".

9
00:00:43,454 --> 00:00:48,750
It was run by a young
producer named Lance Preston.

10
00:00:48,774 --> 00:00:52,370
The idea was that your group
paranormal investigators,

11
00:00:52,395 --> 00:00:57,190
investigate spirits
places and things like that.

12
00:00:57,215 --> 00:00:59,413
And this was long before
any other

13
00:00:59,414 --> 00:01:02,610
program of the same nature
that there are now around.

14
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:04,933
It seemed that he was not in his time.

15
00:01:05,257 --> 00:01:08,654
My name is Lance Preston.

16
00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:10,627
When I was small and
my parents moved us to

17
00:01:10,628 --> 00:01:12,575
a house, which later
found to be haunted.

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,997
The things it found
stayed with me forever.

19
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:18,318
Since then, I'm obsessed
in trying to capture evidence

20
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:21,741
and show that these things are real.

21
00:01:21,766 --> 00:01:23,514
Come with me and
my team

22
00:01:23,515 --> 00:01:24,262
paranormal investigators
professional

23
00:01:24,287 --> 00:01:26,085
while we risk
to enter the premises

24
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,883
Most Haunted
known to man.

25
00:01:28,908 --> 00:01:32,604
We'll be all night, and
with cameras to record everything.

26
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:35,626
If you're ready, it is
time to attend the

27
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:38,848
Grave Encounters
(Meeting Cemetery)

28
00:01:38,873 --> 00:01:41,070
Everything seemed to be going well.

29
00:01:41,095 --> 00:01:46,790
The cuts were to be fantastic.
We were very excited.

30
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,113
We had the same thing.

31
00:01:52,534 --> 00:01:54,131
And then of course, they
did the episode 6.

32
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:57,953
Want to say something else?

33
00:01:57,978 --> 00:02:00,975
Yes! I want to be very
clear about this.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,598
What is about to
see is not a movie.

35
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,121
Ok?

36
00:02:04,146 --> 00:02:07,893
There are 66 hours of film
continuous, unedited,

37
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:10,640
that was written for
Lance's show.

38
00:02:10,665 --> 00:02:14,261
It was not manipulated in any way.

39
00:02:14,286 --> 00:02:18,682
It's just continuous film, only
edited because of length.

40
00:02:21,204 --> 00:02:28,196
(Do not copy the movie)

41
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,117
Action!

42
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:36,038
Hello! Hello! Test Site, you!

43
00:02:36,063 --> 00:02:38,662
Lance Preston!

44
00:02:38,687 --> 00:02:40,685
Catch and background
all the time.

45
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,508
I'll just move a little, wait.

46
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:43,431
Ready? Yes I'm ready!

47
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:47,652
It's still recording.
I want to get you well.

48
00:02:47,677 --> 00:02:50,674
A palace back. Is it good?

49
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:54,395
Good Afternoon! Welcome to a new
Grave Encounters episode.

50
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:57,617
I'm your host
as always, Lance Preston.

51
00:02:57,642 --> 00:02:59,840
And tonight I am very
happy to take you to visit

52
00:02:59,865 --> 00:03:02,662
One of the most terrifying
I have ever seen.

53
00:03:02,687 --> 00:03:05,183
Behind me is the Hospital
Psychiatric Collingwood.

54
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:10,504
This is one of six buildings
an area of ??80 hectares.

55
00:03:10,529 --> 00:03:12,326
Wait, wait, is
to pass a car.

56
00:03:12,351 --> 00:03:15,948
Matt continues from there,
I will not say that again.

57
00:03:15,973 --> 00:03:18,370
Between 1895 and 1960

58
00:03:18,395 --> 00:03:25,188
It was home to more than 80,000 men
sick and mentally disturbed.

59
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:30,408
After its closure in 1963
several ghosts have been seen.

60
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:34,079
Objects that move alone.
And sometimes you hear

61
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,725
the laughter of patients
condemned to live here.

62
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:44,944
Tonight, my team and I
we will be locked for 8 hours.

63
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:46,967
Locked inside,
during the hours

64
00:03:46,968 --> 00:03:48,965
that phenomena are
more frequent.

65
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:51,086
Using the tools most
advanced to hunt ghosts

66
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:55,608
we look, how
were known,

67
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:58,104
ghosts of the Hospital
Psychiatric Collingwood.

68
00:03:59,928 --> 00:04:01,226
Cut. Nice!

69
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:02,050
It was?

70
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:05,872
Morgan! Morgan Turner! Yes Ola Ola

71
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:07,695
Sorry! Thanks for coming.

72
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,618
I know the roads and everything.
Do not worry.

73
00:04:09,643 --> 00:04:10,342
I'm really happy to do this.

74
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:12,364
This will even appear on television?
Yes, hopefully.

75
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:14,088
Do not look for me
I'm just recording.

76
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:16,711
Do not worry, it records everything.

77
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:18,834
Morgan is here with me
Turner, local historian.

78
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,256
Morgan is here today

79
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:24,578
to tell us about the
dark past of the hospital.

80
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:27,700
Morgan? Can you tell us when
the hospital was built?

81
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:32,219
The story is very similar to
other institutes of the same time.

82
00:04:32,244 --> 00:04:35,542
Built in 1893

83
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:41,060
To relieve overcrowding
the County's hospital in Denver.

84
00:04:41,085 --> 00:04:45,681
At the time, mental illness
was not well perceived.

85
00:04:45,706 --> 00:04:46,805
Treatments were only
Many pioneers.

86
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,425
Psychiatric Hospitals like this
were seen as a trash

87
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,548
for family members
embarrassing, rather

88
00:04:53,549 --> 00:04:55,646
a place where
could even heal.

89
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:56,870
Right.

90
00:04:56,895 --> 00:04:58,492
The conditions were minimal,

91
00:04:59,517 --> 00:05:04,211
People slept on the floor, the
times, without blankets or clothing.

92
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:07,333
It was not at all, a place
fun place to be stuck.

93
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:10,155
Can you tell us about
Arthur Freinken?

94
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:14,775
Your story should be the most
interesting about this hospital.

95
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,998
Yes, right.
I assumed I would ask that.

96
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:19,820
Freinken was a neurosurgeon
Harvard graduate.

97
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:23,641
It was placed here from 1937 to 1948.

98
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,613
He was very
known due to their

99
00:05:26,614 --> 00:05:29,560
experimental methods
to operate the brain.

100
00:05:29,585 --> 00:05:32,381
He started the
frontal lobe surgery.

101
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:37,502
Performed about 140 surgeries
to the frontal lobe, the cable.

102
00:05:37,527 --> 00:05:40,724
August 15, 1948.

103
00:05:40,725 --> 00:05:43,920
Six patients had fled
their rooms,

104
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:46,593
and stabbed Freinken
in your office.

105
00:05:46,594 --> 00:05:48,240
His body was found by
a nurse the next day.

106
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:52,761
Unfortunately, this death was
completely irrelevant due to

107
00:05:52,762 --> 00:05:55,258
death of the famous baseball player,
David Bruce, the same day.

108
00:05:55,283 --> 00:05:58,380
Wow! This story is 'the nuts'!

109
00:05:58,405 --> 00:06:02,400
Morgan, give us your opinion more
honest, believe in ghosts?

110
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:10,217
I do not know. But this would be if there
a good place to go looking for them.

111
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:13,090
The traffic was even
crap today.

112
00:06:13,091 --> 00:06:15,137
We did not take long, were
about 6 hours away is not it?

113
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:18,660
"Death awaits you." Oh my God!

114
00:06:18,685 --> 00:06:21,281
Looks like we'll find out.
This is so silly!

115
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:24,453
This may take
rather, they're

116
00:06:24,454 --> 00:06:28,600
old current.
We should not use them.

117
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,823
Take it easy bro.

118
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:33,844
Slow motion, background music.
And it is scary.

119
00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:37,265
Well, that's it. Here we go ...

120
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:39,188
Go take ...

121
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:44,108
Oh my God!

122
00:06:45,732 --> 00:06:47,130
This is the entrance
Main building.

123
00:06:48,854 --> 00:06:49,452
Nice! Yes!

124
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:54,873
If you are family members, make
check-in at the reception, right there.

125
00:06:54,898 --> 00:06:57,595
This is scary as shit!
It's crazy!

126
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:59,718
Are you picking up? Records everything!

127
00:06:59,743 --> 00:07:00,341
I shoot everything!

128
00:07:01,065 --> 00:07:03,463
Do not smoke.

129
00:07:03,488 --> 00:07:07,884
Obviously you can not. Do not try.
It has a fire alarm.

130
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:12,104
I'm here with Kenny Sandivol.
Current caretaker, for eight years.

131
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:16,625
Kenny! Would you say that this
place is haunted?

132
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:21,245
Well, I've never done this before.
Should I speak to you or the camera?

133
00:07:21,369 --> 00:07:23,568
Only ... ignore the camera.

134
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:28,387
I do not know if I believe in spirits
or ghosts or anything.

135
00:07:28,412 --> 00:07:31,209
But since I'm here
seen very strange things.

136
00:07:31,234 --> 00:07:34,231
Especially at night,
can hear the

137
00:07:34,232 --> 00:07:37,228
sounds of the pipe and
of the construction.

138
00:07:37,253 --> 00:07:43,648
It is very difficult to say, but
I'm not alone.

139
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,469
Come see!

140
00:07:47,193 --> 00:07:49,791
Let? Ok

141
00:07:50,516 --> 00:07:51,214
It is as if these corridors
be infinite.

142
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:52,438
Ah, yes.

143
00:07:52,462 --> 00:07:56,959
Hard to believe that this was the home
of thousands of mentally ill.

144
00:07:56,984 --> 00:07:57,183
Exact thousands.

145
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:00,705
The day is so dark here.

146
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:03,226
Are you afraid? Yes.

147
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,248
There are plenty of
interest, which I will show you.

148
00:08:06,273 --> 00:08:11,468
Guys! If you think that now is
wait until dark tonight.

149
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:14,890
None of these work lights,
is just too dark.

150
00:08:14,915 --> 00:08:17,912
You see this window here? Yes.

151
00:08:17,937 --> 00:08:20,334
Closing it before nightfall,
and sometimes I

152
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:24,730
here in the morning, and is
fully open.

153
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:25,954
What!

154
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:26,178
I can not figure out what it is.

155
00:08:26,203 --> 00:08:30,999
It is as if something or someone was
trying to get out or so.

156
00:08:31,923 --> 00:08:33,121
It is definitely a point
interest in the paranormal.

157
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:39,640
Here you? Perfect.

158
00:08:47,857 --> 00:08:51,152
How is it supposed to help
people in those cubicles?

159
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:57,271
Oh my God!
This is officially fucked!

160
00:08:57,296 --> 00:09:00,393
Is this real? Yes, totally real.

161
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:04,814
One patient was here
caught a good few years.

162
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:06,212
And this is what left us.

163
00:09:06,237 --> 00:09:08,235
He spent his time
write on the walls.

164
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,957
Then it was the same
a quarter of patients?

165
00:09:11,982 --> 00:09:13,180
Yes, this was even the fourth
one of the patients. Really?

166
00:09:13,205 --> 00:09:17,801
I do not know if he died here, but
been here a very long time.

167
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:18,424
Very scary.

168
00:09:20,848 --> 00:09:24,043
What the fuck!? Kenny!
This is awesome!

169
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:26,266
Fire, the acoustics are
same shit here.

170
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,790
What is this?

171
00:09:28,815 --> 00:09:31,111
Supposedly a young
patient committed suicide here.

172
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:33,234
What? Right here?!

173
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:38,254
One patient committed suicide right here?
Yes, cut his wrists in this bath.

174
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,477
Oh my God, it's so sad.

175
00:09:41,502 --> 00:09:43,399
Some say they hear the sound of
flow of water coming out.

176
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:46,821
Never heard such a thing.

177
00:09:46,046 --> 00:09:47,245
Where are we going now?

178
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:49,668
Let the service tunnels.

179
00:09:49,993 --> 00:09:51,191
Can not wait to see them.

180
00:09:54,513 --> 00:09:55,411
Pssst! Are you okay?

181
00:09:56,136 --> 00:09:59,232
Kenny! This is exactly
what I was looking for!

182
00:09:59,257 --> 00:10:01,355
These tunnels all the buildings together.

183
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,177
They have almost a mile long.

184
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,896
This is a maze down here.
You can easily lose yourself here.

185
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:18,413
Once I got here, and the
air was very cold.

186
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:23,133
I was so quiet. I felt like
if someone were watching me.

187
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,453
A very strange feeling.

188
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:32,874
What? What? It's just my shadow.

189
00:10:34,196 --> 00:10:37,994
This is Garry Krefeld.
Krefeld company.

190
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,415
He worked here some time ago.

191
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,038
Is that true?

192
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:46,159
In 1983, the state was
try to make some changes here

193
00:10:46,184 --> 00:10:50,180
but in the end it was all the fucking.
Damn sorry.

194
00:10:50,205 --> 00:10:53,503
You want to say again? Yes is better.

195
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,725
Anyway,
I and my staff

196
00:10:55,726 --> 00:10:57,923
came here about
two weeks.

197
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,745
And experienced any type
of supernatural phenomenon?

198
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:07,663
The boys thought
heard weird noises.

199
00:11:07,664 --> 00:11:10,060
And disappeared
some tools.

200
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:14,380
I thought they were thieves but
never seen any, so ...

201
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:17,003
And there was an accident, right? Yes ..

202
00:11:17,027 --> 00:11:21,023
One of the boys went upstairs.
Right there.

203
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:24,596
He swears that something
pushed the stairs.

204
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:26,143
He gave a very hard fall.

205
00:11:26,168 --> 00:11:30,665
He hurt himself on his knees, and gave up.

206
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,737
Does not sound like a
residual haunting.

207
00:11:32,738 --> 00:11:34,785
Sounds more like a
intelligent haunting.

208
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:40,604
A residual haunting is
known as an echo of the past.

209
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:42,627
That repeats itself endlessly.

210
00:11:42,652 --> 00:11:45,149
An intelligent haunting
is actually a spirit.

211
00:11:45,174 --> 00:11:47,471
Interact with intent.

212
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:50,094
There have been reports
people who say they

213
00:11:50,095 --> 00:11:53,691
been pushed, scratched
or even fired.

214
00:11:53,716 --> 00:11:55,113
It's rare but it happens.

215
00:11:55,138 --> 00:11:58,135
So, you used
spend much time here?

216
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,856
Yes, the kids in high school
came here a lot.

217
00:12:02,881 --> 00:12:04,680
You know. Exit and such.

218
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:05,903
And then saw something?

219
00:12:05,228 --> 00:12:07,026
Yes.

220
00:12:07,051 --> 00:12:10,148
We were even here.

221
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:14,169
Here. The date or something.

222
00:12:15,993 --> 00:12:23,885
I looked up and I swear to God.
I swear I saw someone there.

223
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:30,202
One was wearing white robes ...
as a hospital gown ... yes.

224
00:12:30,227 --> 00:12:33,625
And had his head shaved.

225
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:38,645
Appearance of full spectrum!

226
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,667
Why not ask
quickly to the gardener?

227
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:46,186
Sorry! Sorry sir!

228
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:48,359
We are recording a program
TV, and we were

229
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,507
she liked to think of giving
a quick interview.

230
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,828
I am here with the gardener
local, Javier Horteguez.

231
00:12:54,853 --> 00:12:58,348
Javier, have you ever noticed something
stranger around the building?

232
00:12:59,673 --> 00:13:01,171
No. Not really. What do you mean?

233
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:06,791
Well, he heard strange sounds or
witnessed anything paranormal?

234
00:13:06,816 --> 00:13:08,614
I started working here.

235
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,637
He started working. Okay.

236
00:13:10,662 --> 00:13:14,157
TC can take a break?
And if you do for the camera?

237
00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:15,381
Pretend you saw something?

238
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:19,502
I have to go back to work! Ok

239
00:13:19,527 --> 00:13:23,122
It will be fast! Wait, just
wait a bit. You do not have more?

240
00:13:26,844 --> 00:13:28,642
They are $ 20.

241
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:32,063
I am here with the gardener
local, Javier Horteguez.

242
00:13:32,088 --> 00:13:36,084
Javier, saw something in the past
10 years you worked here?

243
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:40,005
Yes, I saw a ghost. Right there.

244
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:42,327
It was very scary.

245
00:13:42,352 --> 00:13:47,548
A spirit outside the building.
Unbelievable.

246
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:49,120
This is a point of interest
supernatural different

247
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:52,668
any that
have recorded before.

248
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:54,490
Three, two, one ...

249
00:13:57,112 --> 00:14:03,706
Due to the huge size of the
We place a medium flame.

250
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:06,328
Houston we Gris
help in the investigation.

251
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,948
Houston! Are you feeling anything?

252
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:17,942
Wow! There is an energy
unbelievable here!

253
00:14:17,466 --> 00:14:19,164
It's like thousands of voices
talking at the same time.

254
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:21,863
This sound is deafening!

255
00:14:22,887 --> 00:14:25,584
There is something more.

256
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,398
There is something more.

257
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:37,720
It's like a dark spirit.

258
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:40,543
It may possibly be a demon.

259
00:14:40,568 --> 00:14:42,465
We have to be extremely
careful tonight.

260
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:47,685
We do not want to play with this thing.
No way.

261
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,205
It's here.

262
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,427
Are you feeling anything?

263
00:14:54,452 --> 00:14:56,450
Yes.

264
00:14:57,174 --> 00:15:01,871
I'm feeling a
great sadness here.

265
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:03,493
A deep sadness.

266
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:12,859
I see a patient.
A female patient.

267
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,704
A girl. There is water, red ...
red water.

268
00:15:18,128 --> 00:15:29,717
Blood. Blood. He died here.
He cut his wrists in the bathtub.

269
00:15:29,142 --> 00:15:33,838
The guard said that a girl
had died here.

270
00:15:33,863 --> 00:15:35,861
Houston! This is incredible.

271
00:15:35,886 --> 00:15:38,382
The spirit is still with us.

272
00:15:42,904 --> 00:15:44,901
Cut.

273
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:45,125
Yes!

274
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,845
There was too much? No.

275
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:59,261
Lance! How do you feel about
to your episode six? Very well.

276
00:15:59,286 --> 00:16:00,484
It is a good place.

277
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:03,857
Do you think this is because
we'll see a ghost?

278
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:05,205
Yes, thousands of them.
I'm sure.

279
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:09,526
Wow! You try to sound like
less antiseptic.

280
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,548
It would be great.
But if we can not, I

281
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:15,545
to make sure we get
a good scares.

282
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:19,065
Wait, wait! TC!

283
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:22,588
Want to record something to the setting of the sun?

284
00:16:22,012 --> 00:16:24,711
Son of a bitch!

285
00:17:52,545 --> 00:17:53,344
House of the window, tip!

286
00:18:09,753 --> 00:18:12,049
Ok, this is scary as shit.
I'll leave.

287
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:29,957
Ok, here we are with our wise
Grave Encounters technician, Matt.

288
00:18:29,982 --> 00:18:32,679
Matt! Why not show us the
What are you doing here?

289
00:18:32,704 --> 00:18:34,552
Installed ten cameras
in static

290
00:18:34,553 --> 00:18:35,400
main points
paranormal activity.

291
00:18:35,425 --> 00:18:37,124
Is recorded on tape.

292
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,147
But it also saved on the hard drive.

293
00:18:39,172 --> 00:18:42,969
All who come here is on
to my computer wirelessly.

294
00:18:42,994 --> 00:18:44,491
So always know
what is happening.

295
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:46,064
Well done Matt!
Why not show to us

296
00:18:46,065 --> 00:18:48,613
what each one
this equipment?

297
00:18:48,638 --> 00:18:51,835
This is an EMF meter.
It is a device that

298
00:18:51,836 --> 00:18:54,031
measures levels of
electricity in the air.

299
00:18:54,056 --> 00:18:56,129
So the main idea
is that when the meter

300
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,202
EMF fields detects human
remains stable.

301
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,276
While the fields
caused by activity

302
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:02,348
paranormal will produce
peaks in reading.

303
00:19:02,373 --> 00:19:05,770
Infrared sensors.

304
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:09,391
The idea is the same as the EMF, but this
shows changes in temperature.

305
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:13,512
It is believed that the spirits
cause a loss of temperature.

306
00:19:13,537 --> 00:19:15,835
Known in the community
paranormal, such as cold spots.

307
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,457
One, two, three ...

308
00:19:17,482 --> 00:19:21,679
This is a recorder
analog audio. Right.

309
00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:24,901
It is used to capture EVPs.
Oh wait ...

310
00:19:24,926 --> 00:19:28,021
Explains to the audience
What is an EVP.

311
00:19:28,046 --> 00:19:30,244
Electronic Voice Phenomenon
(Electronic Voice Phenomenon).

312
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:35,964
Capture sounds that the ear
humans can not detect.

313
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:37,337
So when you play,
if we hear something,

314
00:19:37,338 --> 00:19:40,684
means that something is
trying to communicate with us.

315
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:43,006
This is my favorite.
The Geiger counter.

316
00:19:43,031 --> 00:19:45,079
Turns the sound here, and
you're ready to go.

317
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,127
Look at this! It is spectacular.

318
00:19:48,951 --> 00:19:54,745
I assure you, if there is anything
paranormal here, we'll catch it.

319
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:58,966
Well folks, we are ready
to be locked.

320
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:00,138
My friend Kenny, the
janitor of the building,

321
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:02,286
will have the honor of
locked inside.

322
00:20:02,311 --> 00:20:07,006
Kenny, thank you!
See you at 6 am.

323
00:20:07,031 --> 00:20:09,329
Six hours exactly. Good luck!

324
00:20:12,851 --> 00:20:15,348
I am a demon. A demon child.

325
00:20:16,372 --> 00:20:18,571
I can not wait to see you in the morning.

326
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:24,989
Yes, we have to spend the
night with these two freaks.

327
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,911
What are you doing?
I'm talking to Kenny.

328
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,984
He locked the door?
It's good for the show.

329
00:20:29,985 --> 00:20:31,032
Do not worry about it.

330
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:33,855
What do we do if we need
more material?

331
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,577
Well done! This is what will happen.

332
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:41,597
This is the best place
ever investigated.

333
00:20:41,622 --> 00:20:43,620
And the most dangerous.

334
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:45,242
I want to draw attention
to the fact that

335
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:48,839
have been built
almost like a prison.

336
00:20:48,864 --> 00:20:51,612
All the windows have bars.
Could never

337
00:20:51,613 --> 00:20:53,359
leave, even
we wanted.

338
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:56,081
We are locked here
Kenny in until the

339
00:20:56,082 --> 00:20:59,778
janitor of the building in
come get the morning.

340
00:20:59,803 --> 00:21:02,800
We will be working
in total darkness.

341
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:05,322
Capturing all three
night vision cameras.

342
00:21:05,346 --> 00:21:07,294
More static cameras
Matt set up in the

343
00:21:07,295 --> 00:21:09,242
main points
paranormal activity.

344
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:13,664
Okay folks! When you are
ready, it's about time we had a

345
00:21:14,888 --> 00:21:18,083
Grave Encounters!

346
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:21,005
Okay, we're
now go through the

347
00:21:21,006 --> 00:21:24,902
dark corridors of
old institution.

348
00:21:26,925 --> 00:21:29,822
Abandoned for over 50 years.

349
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:34,842
We are looking for souls
were trapped in life.

350
00:21:34,867 --> 00:21:37,164
And probably trapped
after life.

351
00:21:38,188 --> 00:21:42,084
I feel a cold, it's cold here.

352
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:45,756
This was the corridor
where you could see

353
00:21:45,757 --> 00:21:47,403
the appearance of the person
with the shaved head,

354
00:21:47,428 --> 00:21:50,726
to hang down the hall.

355
00:21:50,751 --> 00:21:52,148
Sasha, we use the PVS.

356
00:21:53,372 --> 00:21:56,069
Is there someone here with us?

357
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:01,289
You were a patient here?

358
00:22:01,314 --> 00:22:05,910
You used to live here in the hospital?
Down again.

359
00:22:05,435 --> 00:22:08,032
"Is there someone here with us?"

360
00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:13,352
"You were a patient here?"

361
00:22:16,674 --> 00:22:18,272
"You used to live here in the hospital?"

362
00:22:21,493 --> 00:22:23,391
Nothing.

363
00:22:24,315 --> 00:22:26,714
Wait! I felt like ...

364
00:22:26,338 --> 00:22:29,235
Spirit, thou hast no
to be afraid of us.

365
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,658
If you're here, show yourself!

366
00:22:33,882 --> 00:22:36,978
I think it is getting cold as
move along, is to join us.

367
00:22:36,003 --> 00:22:38,001
Whether we will be here.

368
00:22:38,026 --> 00:22:44,820
If there is a spirit here
us, give us a sign.

369
00:22:45,545 --> 00:22:47,842
Open the window!

370
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:50,664
Even just a little bit.

371
00:22:57,082 --> 00:23:04,675
Now I use this camera to
try to capture paranormal anomalies.

372
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,197
Normally, there are
seen by the human eye.

373
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:09,020
It is known as
spirit photography.

374
00:23:16,538 --> 00:23:18,636
One more.

375
00:23:18,661 --> 00:23:20,659
We expect that
photos are revealed.

376
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:24,379
If there is a ghost behind
me, just let us know later.

377
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:32,196
It was you who wrote these walls?

378
00:23:32,221 --> 00:23:35,918
Or just wanted to try to communicate?

379
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,934
Why not try
communicate with me now?

380
00:23:51,652 --> 00:24:00,042
If the patient who killed himself in this room,
in the same bath, is here now,

381
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:04,163
that show.

382
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:13,779
I'm really scared here.

383
00:24:13,104 --> 00:24:16,500
The chambers 2 and 4 have
temperature gauges.

384
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,016
Personally, I am the only one
have to be here alone?

385
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:30,936
Houston, feel anything?

386
00:24:30,961 --> 00:24:34,957
I feel a very negative energy here.

387
00:24:35,582 --> 00:24:41,875
Not just one but many.

388
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,794
If there are spirits here
below, please show yourselves!

389
00:24:50,816 --> 00:24:53,513
Do you hear a sound.

390
00:24:53,437 --> 00:24:58,833
As I said, it seems that
these pipes are endless.

391
00:25:00,956 --> 00:25:02,654
And it smells bad here.

392
00:25:03,177 --> 00:25:06,575
Heard what? I also heard.

393
00:25:11,494 --> 00:25:15,990
Ok, we hear something. What was that?

394
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:18,912
I do not know, come here. Here, follow me.

395
00:25:19,636 --> 00:25:22,733
Where does it sound? Behind this door.

396
00:25:22,758 --> 00:25:23,357
Ali

397
00:25:24,081 --> 00:25:27,778
Want to open it?
You can slide the camera?

398
00:25:27,803 --> 00:25:30,500
Oh, not really. Damn!

399
00:25:30,525 --> 00:25:32,223
Shit.

400
00:25:37,442 --> 00:25:41,639
Shut up. They are rats.

401
00:25:41,664 --> 00:25:43,562
No way! Really?

402
00:25:43,587 --> 00:25:45,484
It's nothing more.

403
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:49,905
You're an idiot! There was a joke!

404
00:25:49,906 --> 00:25:50,905
This is almost as scary
as the "Saw Dawn"!

405
00:26:49,994 --> 00:26:52,091
Can this be plasmo-waste.

406
00:26:52,115 --> 00:26:56,512
Discovered for the first time
Team Record Encounters?

407
00:26:57,761 --> 00:27:01,657
I think we should give more
a look at the top.

408
00:27:01,682 --> 00:27:04,078
Saves me a few shots in the hallways,
does that chilling effect.

409
00:27:04,103 --> 00:27:08,699
As we did Playview Mansion.

410
00:27:08,724 --> 00:27:11,721
Yes yes, and then cut.

411
00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:21,136
Scary, scary, scary.

412
00:27:25,757 --> 00:27:28,353
"CHECKERS OF THE DEAD. KING ME."

413
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:34,572
What the fuck?!

414
00:27:34,597 --> 00:27:37,694
"GLORY HOLE"

415
00:27:37,318 --> 00:27:40,616
Kitchen of the dead.

416
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,836
Said to cause me to lunch, bitch!

417
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:47,258
What the fuck is that?

418
00:27:47,283 --> 00:27:50,480
This is scarier.
How did we miss this?

419
00:27:51,505 --> 00:27:53,202
Lance is gonna love me!

420
00:27:53,227 --> 00:27:56,724
Shit.

421
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:04,440
Wait, wait, wait ...

422
00:28:09,861 --> 00:28:12,758
Yes, my dear?

423
00:28:12,783 --> 00:28:15,680
She is crying, give him the phone.

424
00:28:16,504 --> 00:28:18,401
Hello sweet!

425
00:28:18,426 --> 00:28:20,124
What your mother told me
was that you fear

426
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:22,822
the monsters are
under your bed.

427
00:28:22,847 --> 00:28:24,245
We've had this conversation?

428
00:28:24,246 --> 00:28:29,264
The monsters are not real.

429
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:33,085
Even if they were not
came to our house.

430
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,207
You know that Daddy will take care of you.

431
00:28:37,931 --> 00:28:40,928
Says the mother who gave permission
to sleep with her today.

432
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:43,249
Daddy will not be
at home until tomorrow.

433
00:28:43,274 --> 00:28:47,671
We will go to a pizzeria.
The father will be home soon.

434
00:28:47,696 --> 00:28:49,293
Bye bye.

435
00:28:55,813 --> 00:28:58,309
Because I got myself into this?

436
00:29:07,525 --> 00:29:10,722
Shit, it's cold.

437
00:29:10,747 --> 00:29:13,744
What the fuck was that!

438
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:16,566
Guys, stop this shit!
I'm not playing!

439
00:29:18,488 --> 00:29:21,285
It is not the best time
to do this shit!

440
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,308
What the fuck?!

441
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:29,528
Where are people?

442
00:29:29,553 --> 00:29:31,551
Maybe it was the wind or so.

443
00:29:31,576 --> 00:29:33,873
Solid. Not a tornado
would be able to move it.

444
00:29:33,874 --> 00:29:35,171
How do you think
it weighs?

445
00:29:35,196 --> 00:29:39,692
TC, how do you move?

446
00:29:39,717 --> 00:29:41,415
Whatever it was,
scared me like anything.

447
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,137
You can not explain?

448
00:29:44,162 --> 00:29:47,159
I have told you. I was shooting,
then turned and the door closed.

449
00:29:47,184 --> 00:29:50,981
I thought you were the first.
Were you shooting?

450
00:29:50,006 --> 00:29:53,603
I had already told you.
You were so busy ...

451
00:29:53,628 --> 00:29:55,126
Grave? Let's see.

452
00:29:58,948 --> 00:30:00,145
Oh my God!

453
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,568
That's scary.

454
00:30:04,692 --> 00:30:07,689
I accept your apology,
I accept your apology.

455
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,111
I do not think you saw that!

456
00:30:09,136 --> 00:30:12,634
The footage we just saw the
moments ago, was captured by

457
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:14,056
TC cameramen.

458
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:18,777
This door behind
me close by itself.

459
00:30:18,802 --> 00:30:23,197
There was no wind, no open windows
that could have caused this,

460
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:28,517
Let's now
establish contact.

461
00:30:32,337 --> 00:30:38,932
Is there anyone here with us?
Please make a noise.

462
00:30:40,855 --> 00:30:43,552
Batam in anything.

463
00:30:45,775 --> 00:30:47,372
Feel free
to close the door

464
00:30:47,373 --> 00:30:50,969
as did also
the bit with the TC.

465
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:54,790
Feel free to hit with
her with the strength you want.

466
00:30:54,915 --> 00:30:57,312
Force Shut it!

467
00:31:00,134 --> 00:31:03,531
Now, please give us a sign!

468
00:31:06,853 --> 00:31:09,650
Spirit, I invoke thee
to appear.

469
00:31:11,472 --> 00:31:17,567
If there is someone here,
give us a sign ...

470
00:31:17,391 --> 00:31:20,689
Shit. Shit.

471
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:22,011
Do you really think
we had something here.

472
00:31:22,036 --> 00:31:25,133
Shit! What was it?

473
00:31:25,158 --> 00:31:27,956
Oh my God!

474
00:31:27,981 --> 00:31:29,179
That was very
scary people!

475
00:31:29,404 --> 00:31:31,302
He came here!

476
00:31:36,523 --> 00:31:37,721
Shit, I see nothing.

477
00:31:37,746 --> 00:31:39,844
Did you hear?

478
00:31:44,664 --> 00:31:47,861
What? Oh shit ...

479
00:31:47,886 --> 00:31:48,484
Shit ...

480
00:31:53,505 --> 00:31:54,904
What the fuck?!

481
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:56,126
Hello!

482
00:31:59,048 --> 00:32:02,546
This is fucked up people.

483
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:08,864
What is this personal? Matt?

484
00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:11,686
Matt, is there anyone there?

485
00:32:11,711 --> 00:32:14,808
Is there someone at some of the
floors above us?

486
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,830
No. What is happening?

487
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:19,053
Does anyone know what we're here
shoot and walk with us to enjoy.

488
00:32:19,078 --> 00:32:21,176
Why do not we get out?

489
00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:24,497
Because this is where the sound came.
Jesus Christ.

490
00:32:25,722 --> 00:32:27,520
Hello!

491
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:30,742
Is there anyone here?
Somebody's kidding us.

492
00:32:31,465 --> 00:32:35,261
If someone is here to enjoy
us, no joke!

493
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:39,783
I'll call the police!
We have the right to be here!

494
00:32:39,808 --> 00:32:42,605
We have permission, and you do not!

495
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,027
Lower your voice. I'm trying to talk!

496
00:32:44,052 --> 00:32:48,549
Calm down guys. This is something real.

497
00:32:50,171 --> 00:32:53,468
I will use the EVP.

498
00:32:55,991 --> 00:32:57,388
What's your name?

499
00:32:57,413 --> 00:33:00,711
What do you want?

500
00:33:01,135 --> 00:33:04,132
You are in the room with us?

501
00:33:04,157 --> 00:33:07,854
Where are you?

502
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:09,977
Come on, Sasha. Add to give.

503
00:33:09,002 --> 00:33:10,200
"What's your name?"

504
00:33:10,225 --> 00:33:12,223
"What do you want?"

505
00:33:13,247 --> 00:33:16,545
"Are you in the room with us?"

506
00:33:16,969 --> 00:33:19,567
"Where are you?"

507
00:33:19,592 --> 00:33:23,688
What's that sound? What is this?

508
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:31,704
What the fuck was that?
What the fuck was that?

509
00:33:32,628 --> 00:33:35,625
No way! I recorded it.

510
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,348
Sasha!

511
00:33:36,373 --> 00:33:41,669
Please, please, I
want to go back to the entrance!

512
00:33:41,694 --> 00:33:42,342
I played some shit!

513
00:33:42,343 --> 00:33:44,991
Was some shit
breathe with me!

514
00:33:44,016 --> 00:33:49,410
We gotta go, gotta go now!

515
00:33:49,435 --> 00:33:52,432
Wait, wait a second.
Wait for what?

516
00:33:52,457 --> 00:33:55,854
We shot this program to what?
Five episodes?

517
00:33:55,855 --> 00:33:57,252
And we've never seen anything like it before.

518
00:33:57,277 --> 00:34:01,073
I do not care!
I just want to get out of here!

519
00:34:01,098 --> 00:34:05,694
Houston, going down there
and turns right ok?

520
00:34:05,719 --> 00:34:07,717
I'd rather be down there.
No, no.

521
00:34:07,742 --> 00:34:09,140
I need another face in the camera.

522
00:34:09,165 --> 00:34:12,862
I'm really scared, I think
I can not do this ...

523
00:34:12,887 --> 00:34:15,884
Be a fucking work ok?
Retains the character.

524
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:18,606
We found something here.

525
00:34:18,631 --> 00:34:19,429
I do not do that.

526
00:34:19,454 --> 00:34:21,452
Ok, I'll be back. I'll go with Houston.

527
00:34:22,176 --> 00:34:25,574
No no. You come with me, come on.

528
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,696
What are you doing?
Are you kidding? Did you see that?

529
00:34:28,721 --> 00:34:32,316
We could find thousands of things!
Make millions ($$)!

530
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,936
Even the moments
this same corridor

531
00:34:37,961 --> 00:34:40,058
undeniable proven track record
of paranormal activity.

532
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:46,476
Sasha was terrified because
a ghost touched her hair.

533
00:34:47,301 --> 00:34:51,897
Let's try to make contact.

534
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:57,315
Spirit, which hangs in the hallway

535
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,688
to beg
show us a sign.

536
00:35:00,689 --> 00:35:02,036
Show yourself!

537
00:35:05,658 --> 00:35:07,155
Please!

538
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,175
If you're still here
us, give us a sign.

539
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:17,770
It plays a sound or
in my hair.

540
00:35:20,392 --> 00:35:23,989
Do you see anything?

541
00:35:23,014 --> 00:35:27,510
No. Wait. Give me the light ... no, nothing.

542
00:35:27,535 --> 00:35:29,933
Not you dare ask me ...
We are a team.

543
00:35:30,456 --> 00:35:32,454
I think it disappeared.

544
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:35,127
Honestly, that is
all very funny ...

545
00:35:35,128 --> 00:35:38,774
with these games that
we are preaching ...

546
00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:40,597
Well, I do not know.

547
00:35:40,622 --> 00:35:42,219
Come on, do something.

548
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:47,540
Have done before, do it again.

549
00:35:47,565 --> 00:35:49,062
Are you fucking scared?

550
00:35:54,682 --> 00:35:58,878
Jesus Christ. Forget it.

551
00:35:58,903 --> 00:36:02,299
Lance! Disappeared ...
is enjoying with us ...

552
00:36:02,324 --> 00:36:05,221
Shut up! Stop saying shit scenes.
Relax.

553
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,844
We could go home now?

554
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:12,764
Lance, some people try
answers all of life.

555
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:13,988
Ok

556
00:36:13,412 --> 00:36:16,510
TC, what time is it?

557
00:36:16,535 --> 00:36:17,433
04:40

558
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:21,655
Let's go home.

559
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,675
Folks, we have footage that arrive.
Why do not we take everything and get out?

560
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,897
Let's go home.

561
00:36:28,922 --> 00:36:30,120
You have everything saved? Yes.

562
00:36:31,744 --> 00:36:33,442
I think it's right, up ahead.

563
00:36:35,465 --> 00:36:38,962
Are you sure?

564
00:36:38,987 --> 00:36:40,985
Yes, that's all. That's all.

565
00:36:44,906 --> 00:36:48,401
Is this the way, right?
Shit, it's a dead end.

566
00:36:48,426 --> 00:36:50,125
Personal.

567
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,748
Shit.

568
00:36:52,773 --> 00:36:54,170
Not here.

569
00:36:54,195 --> 00:36:55,394
Come on, come on!

570
00:36:55,419 --> 00:36:59,215
Come on TC admits ...

571
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,638
What are applications?
We're not lost.

572
00:37:02,663 --> 00:37:05,859
We're not lost,
we came here ...

573
00:37:05,884 --> 00:37:11,678
Matt! Matt! We lost shovel.

574
00:37:11,703 --> 00:37:16,598
I need some information ...

575
00:37:17,122 --> 00:37:19,120
Why the hell is he not responding?

576
00:37:19,145 --> 00:37:22,742
I'm not going there. TC! Why?

577
00:37:22,767 --> 00:37:25,664
Because let's go back here.

578
00:37:25,689 --> 00:37:30,383
If we go in one direction,
'll get there ok?

579
00:37:30,408 --> 00:37:32,607
What? North?

580
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:35,779
I went around, and there
the corner is where

581
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,126
was the bathtub.
He knows where we are.

582
00:37:37,151 --> 00:37:41,847
've Been here since
TC were here.

583
00:37:41,872 --> 00:37:43,820
Explain to me when
saw this tub.

584
00:37:43,821 --> 00:37:45,768
Not the same bathtub!

585
00:37:45,793 --> 00:37:47,791
I know it is not.

586
00:37:47,816 --> 00:37:49,314
TC, get up, go.
He said six hours was not it?

587
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:53,535
You'll sleep here? Kenny is at 6 right?
I can not wait.

588
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,758
I can not wait, can not wait.

589
00:37:55,783 --> 00:37:57,881
I will not walk in darkness.
I can not wait.

590
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:06,296
Where are they?

591
00:38:11,316 --> 00:38:14,814
Shit.

592
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:18,934
Where have you been?
Do not hear me calling you?

593
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:22,855
* All the talk at the same time! *

594
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,377
We lost ourselves.
We do not hear the walkie-talkies?

595
00:38:25,402 --> 00:38:28,500
I do not hear the radio call?

596
00:38:28,525 --> 00:38:31,621
No, not heard. You hear? No.

597
00:38:31,646 --> 00:38:33,443
Because we locked Lance?

598
00:38:33,468 --> 00:38:36,766
Lance!

599
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:38,189
Because they had to lock
the fucking door?

600
00:38:38,214 --> 00:38:41,511
Holy shit!

601
00:38:41,536 --> 00:38:43,934
What are you seeing? What is it?

602
00:38:43,959 --> 00:38:45,456
Her hair. Oh shit.

603
00:38:45,481 --> 00:38:48,178
Fuck.

604
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:50,752
I'll download it
to the computer.

605
00:38:50,753 --> 00:38:51,300
No, Matt, we do not have time.

606
00:38:51,325 --> 00:38:54,372
Take in the chambers
Still, all come together.

607
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:57,419
Guys, let's stand up
and begin to fix everything.

608
00:38:57,444 --> 00:38:59,242
Let's get ready to
when Kenny arrived.

609
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:02,864
Someone help me?
Please? No no.

610
00:39:02,889 --> 00:39:04,187
I need everyone
down here, sorry.

611
00:39:04,212 --> 00:39:06,110
I know.

612
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:09,732
You have a radio? Yes, I have a radio.

613
00:39:09,757 --> 00:39:11,255
Working? I hope so.

614
00:39:11,256 --> 00:39:14,375
Do you hear that? Yes, that's great,

615
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,898
Be right back, okay? Ok man.

616
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:20,520
Do not go without me.

617
00:39:29,736 --> 00:39:32,132
Okay, it's time to get out of here.

618
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:53,736
Fuck!

619
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,256
What the fuck!

620
00:40:06,773 --> 00:40:07,371
Lance, are you there?

621
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:16,387
Personally, I found something here.

622
00:40:17,111 --> 00:40:19,809
Hello!

623
00:40:22,532 --> 00:40:24,729
Lance!

624
00:40:25,053 --> 00:40:26,252
Hello!

625
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:31,072
Guys, stop playing!

626
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,177
The morning is now approaching.

627
00:40:50,202 --> 00:40:53,299
We have not seen anything paranormal
this last hour.

628
00:40:53,324 --> 00:40:57,620
Grave Encounters,
I am Lance Preston.

629
00:40:57,445 --> 00:40:59,243
Again. No, we do not have ...

630
00:40:59,268 --> 00:41:01,266
Again.

631
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:05,287
Grave Encounters,
I am Lance Preston.

632
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:09,008
That's all I have.
I can not do this anymore.

633
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:15,727
No matter, tomorrow with the light
the morning will be much better.

634
00:41:15,752 --> 00:41:17,050
That sounds good.
Where is Matt, anyway?

635
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:20,672
Why is it taking so long?

636
00:41:20,697 --> 00:41:21,195
Matt?

637
00:41:23,918 --> 00:41:25,016
Matt? Are you there?

638
00:41:27,939 --> 00:41:29,837
Matt? Lance!

639
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,260
The radio was not working before.

640
00:41:34,882 --> 00:41:40,576
Personally, I know this
will sound stupid ...

641
00:41:40,601 --> 00:41:43,298
I'm the last person who wants
back to walk these halls

642
00:41:43,323 --> 00:41:48,718
It's dark, it can
have fallen and have been hurt.

643
00:41:48,743 --> 00:41:49,942
She's right, he may be hurt.

644
00:41:53,563 --> 00:41:56,660
Folks, we have to go look for the.
Very well.

645
00:41:56,685 --> 00:42:00,781
This is ridiculous. Let's look it up.

646
00:42:00,205 --> 00:42:04,602
TC takes the camera.
Sasha takes the camera. Why?

647
00:42:04,627 --> 00:42:07,923
If we do this is
good that shot it.

648
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:12,193
Thanks for your help.
Hey! By the way, not

649
00:42:12,194 --> 00:42:15,940
is easy to get here
alone, I tell you right now.

650
00:42:15,965 --> 00:42:17,163
Jesus Christ.

651
00:42:18,987 --> 00:42:20,585
Matt!

652
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,497
Matt! Matt! Matt!

653
00:42:37,818 --> 00:42:39,915
What the fuck?

654
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:40,139
Shit!

655
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:48,756
Why is this shit
scattered all around?

656
00:42:48,781 --> 00:42:49,480
Fuck.

657
00:42:55,899 --> 00:42:56,497
Okay, okay, okay.

658
00:42:57,522 --> 00:42:58,521
Why he left
the equipment here?

659
00:42:58,522 --> 00:42:59,520
Should not have done.

660
00:42:59,545 --> 00:43:03,941
He should be tidying up.
He must be here somewhere.

661
00:43:03,966 --> 00:43:06,863
TC going there, Sasha
and I will go here.

662
00:43:06,888 --> 00:43:09,685
Why we do this?
It is a terrible idea.

663
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:12,607
He has to be here, not
would leave things around ...

664
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,329
Sasha comes to me.
TC goes by that side.

665
00:43:17,251 --> 00:43:22,547
This looks like my room after
arguing with my girl!

666
00:43:22,572 --> 00:43:25,768
Matt, where are you man?
I want to go home, that's enough!

667
00:43:25,793 --> 00:43:27,291
Have we scared you are!

668
00:43:27,316 --> 00:43:30,514
I am looking for cigarettes.

669
00:43:32,136 --> 00:43:34,834
Come on, Matt!

670
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:36,557
Not funny man.

671
00:43:43,675 --> 00:43:44,373
It will take the horns.

672
00:43:55,588 --> 00:43:57,586
Matt! Come on, buddy!

673
00:43:57,611 --> 00:43:59,008
Look what my wife will kill me!

674
00:43:59,033 --> 00:44:04,928
It's late! Come on man.

675
00:44:04,953 --> 00:44:06,951
You better be dead
than to die.

676
00:44:06,976 --> 00:44:12,270
Matt. I'm not kidding! Where are you?

677
00:44:12,295 --> 00:44:14,993
What the fuck?!

678
00:44:32,499 --> 00:44:34,497
Lance! Sasha!

679
00:44:35,522 --> 00:44:37,119
Shit! What happened, what happened?

680
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,241
What, what? No, no.

681
00:44:42,064 --> 00:44:43,763
You okay man?

682
00:44:43,788 --> 00:44:45,786
Raise me. What?

683
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:47,509
Raise me.

684
00:44:50,306 --> 00:44:52,004
I swear, someone ...

685
00:44:53,128 --> 00:44:55,826
I was pushed ok?

686
00:44:55,851 --> 00:44:57,649
Someone pushed me fucking!

687
00:44:57,674 --> 00:45:00,821
I was on the stairs, the
Matt's looking, I looked

688
00:45:00,822 --> 00:45:03,968
down, and something pushed me
was breaking the neck.

689
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:05,090
Oh my God.
I looked back and there was nothing there.

690
00:45:05,115 --> 00:45:09,211
These are things to enjoy with us.
It has been like this all night

691
00:45:09,236 --> 00:45:11,234
Call him! Call Kenny!
What are you waiting for?

692
00:45:11,259 --> 00:45:13,157
Okay, okay!

693
00:45:13,182 --> 00:45:15,480
League now. I'll call ok? Take it easy.

694
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,403
Jesus Christ.

695
00:45:17,428 --> 00:45:20,225
Are you okay? No, I'm fine!

696
00:45:22,048 --> 00:45:25,845
Holy shit!

697
00:45:26,369 --> 00:45:30,265
I have no network, your attempt.

698
00:45:35,484 --> 00:45:37,282
Good!

699
00:45:37,307 --> 00:45:39,506
Good shit!

700
00:45:43,727 --> 00:45:45,924
What the hell are you doing TC?

701
00:45:45,949 --> 00:45:47,347
What do you think I'm doing?
Come help me.

702
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:51,669
You can not break the door! Then see!

703
00:45:51,694 --> 00:45:55,689
We can not damage the building,
we are responsible for this.

704
00:45:55,714 --> 00:45:57,612
Wait! The man can not see shit!

705
00:45:58,836 --> 00:46:00,034
Then shovel?

706
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:01,258
This will go out of your paycheck!

707
00:46:01,283 --> 00:46:03,181
You think I care? No!

708
00:46:03,206 --> 00:46:04,404
Shit man!

709
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:07,326
I'm sick of this shit,
want to go home

710
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:12,547
I lie down and sleep.

711
00:46:12,572 --> 00:46:15,669
This program is your only man.

712
00:46:15,694 --> 00:46:16,893
Put the fucking camera on the floor

713
00:46:16,918 --> 00:46:16,417
and help me.

714
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:21,037
Help me.

715
00:46:21,062 --> 00:46:22,261
Ok

716
00:46:24,384 --> 00:46:26,583
Ok

717
00:46:26,608 --> 00:46:29,505
Need my help? No.

718
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:31,528
We're fine.

719
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:35,848
Shit, the three ok?

720
00:46:35,873 --> 00:46:39,269
One, two, three ...

721
00:46:41,491 --> 00:46:44,189
Fuck!

722
00:46:45,513 --> 00:46:47,711
Are you pushing? Yes I am.

723
00:46:47,736 --> 00:46:51,132
One, two, three ...

724
00:46:57,951 --> 00:46:59,849
What the fuck?!

725
00:47:00,472 --> 00:47:04,769
No, this is the fucking entry!

726
00:47:04,794 --> 00:47:05,992
This entry is the shit!

727
00:47:08,914 --> 00:47:10,112
We got here right?

728
00:47:10,137 --> 00:47:13,535
Yes, this is the entrance.

729
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,758
This is not right.

730
00:47:14,783 --> 00:47:15,282
This is impossible.

731
00:47:15,307 --> 00:47:19,903
It was here that we got right?

732
00:47:19,028 --> 00:47:21,026
It was here that brought things.

733
00:47:21,051 --> 00:47:23,348
This makes no sense.

734
00:47:26,871 --> 00:47:28,368
Makes no sense.

735
00:47:28,393 --> 00:47:31,591
It was here we come.

736
00:47:31,616 --> 00:47:33,914
It's just a hallway ...
I do not know ...

737
00:47:33,939 --> 00:47:37,835
He should have gone to get around, should
on the other side of the building.

738
00:47:38,258 --> 00:47:40,456
Lance!

739
00:47:46,676 --> 00:47:47,874
Lance!

740
00:47:49,297 --> 00:47:52,694
Are the same ports.

741
00:47:54,817 --> 00:47:56,215
I'm getting tired of this staff.

742
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,537
Yes!

743
00:47:59,562 --> 00:48:02,859
Houston, hold it.
Hold that, please.

744
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,279
Be careful with your leg
careful with your leg!

745
00:48:06,304 --> 00:48:09,301
Shut up, you stay where you only the
look and not do anything!

746
00:48:09,326 --> 00:48:11,525
Okay, okay!

747
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:13,548
What's wrong with you?

748
00:48:13,573 --> 00:48:15,070
One, two, three ...

749
00:48:26,884 --> 00:48:28,583
Fuck!

750
00:48:30,705 --> 00:48:33,202
What is there to say?
What's up Cock?

751
00:48:33,227 --> 00:48:36,824
Perhaps this is the way
for the emergency exit.

752
00:48:36,849 --> 00:48:37,048
Houston shut the fuck up shit!

753
00:48:37,073 --> 00:48:38,272
Shut the fuck up shit!

754
00:48:39,696 --> 00:48:41,894
This, you see?

755
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:42,118
Move over.

756
00:48:42,143 --> 00:48:45,840
This work is man!

757
00:48:46,463 --> 00:48:48,261
Go la ... You did?

758
00:48:49,986 --> 00:48:50,284
Give me a minute ok?

759
00:48:53,507 --> 00:48:56,303
Oh fuck!
We are here fucking locked!

760
00:48:57,027 --> 00:49:00,124
Let's get a tool.
We try to take the bars.

761
00:49:00,149 --> 00:49:05,944
I have a toolbox.
But it's in the bag, out there!

762
00:49:05,969 --> 00:49:08,866
There was you who wanted to lock in?

763
00:49:08,891 --> 00:49:10,989
Fucking amazing idea!

764
00:49:11,513 --> 00:49:14,210
Obviously all
windows have bars.

765
00:49:14,235 --> 00:49:18,231
No, no! The window up there!
There was no bar do you?

766
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:20,654
We go there.

767
00:49:20,679 --> 00:49:22,877
Come have my faith!

768
00:49:22,401 --> 00:49:25,899
What time is it Sasha?

769
00:49:25,924 --> 00:49:26,122
8:44

770
00:49:26,147 --> 00:49:27,346
You gotta be fucking kidding me!

771
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:30,418
I spotted you fucking? Got it?!

772
00:49:30,419 --> 00:49:33,465
8:44 pa are!
I have an audition tomorrow!

773
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:36,688
Nobody cares to you
or with your fucking

774
00:49:36,689 --> 00:49:38,885
nor with the career
hearing your shit!

775
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:40,609
Guys, let me
think for a minute!

776
00:49:40,634 --> 00:49:42,131
It makes no sense, it's all fucked!

777
00:49:42,156 --> 00:49:45,553
I checked the time of
Sunrise last night.

778
00:49:45,578 --> 00:49:47,576
What are you trying to say shit?

779
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:51,297
Should begin to be
clear from the 7:45.

780
00:49:54,819 --> 00:49:56,117
But it's still night.

781
00:49:57,641 --> 00:50:00,838
Still is the night ...
makes no sense!

782
00:50:00,863 --> 00:50:02,761
There's no joke man.

783
00:50:02,786 --> 00:50:03,184
Shut up!

784
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,408
It makes no sense.

785
00:50:04,433 --> 00:50:10,828
Get them out of this building! Please!
Somebody help us!

786
00:50:11,151 --> 00:50:18,645
Ok ok. Ok let's be rational?
A building is old right?

787
00:50:18,669 --> 00:50:21,166
It is an old building can
to be an anomaly

788
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:25,662
power that made the mess
our clocks fastest ...

789
00:50:25,687 --> 00:50:29,482
So if this does not
this would be hours yet.

790
00:50:30,507 --> 00:50:31,206
This would explain why
it is still dark,

791
00:50:31,207 --> 00:50:33,904
and why Kenny
has not yet appeared.

792
00:50:33,929 --> 00:50:35,426
Electric anomaly!
That idea sucks!

793
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:38,348
Why come to the
your ideas of rationalism?

794
00:50:38,373 --> 00:50:41,370
This is not an audition for any of the
your science fiction movies!

795
00:50:41,395 --> 00:50:43,794
There is nothing rational here.

796
00:50:43,795 --> 00:50:44,192
It is as rational as
anything else here.

797
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:12,488
I checked my phone e. ..

798
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,808
And mark 13:12 hours.

799
00:51:19,131 --> 00:51:22,428
Is 13:12 pm

800
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:29,146
I do not think is right.
But I think that occurred to me ...

801
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:34,666
I do not know. They are all
are so tired

802
00:51:34,667 --> 00:51:37,363
to take a nap.
Are taking a break.

803
00:51:39,786 --> 00:51:41,984
Let's wait until Kenny appears.

804
00:51:43,307 --> 00:51:47,903
I do not know how he
we will find.

805
00:51:47,928 --> 00:51:48,127
Makes no sense.

806
00:51:52,548 --> 00:51:54,746
I have not slept for about 20 hours.

807
00:51:56,669 --> 00:52:02,162
I'll stop now for a bit e. ..
I take a nap.

808
00:52:32,356 --> 00:52:34,254
What the fuck?!

809
00:52:36,477 --> 00:52:38,375
Houston, what is your problem man?

810
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,497
It was not me!
What are you doing, man?

811
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,817
What happened?
Oh my God!

812
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:52,136
Someone or something just
from our lights.

813
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,857
We are in total darkness.
All we

814
00:52:56,858 --> 00:52:58,355
remains are the lanterns and
the lights of the cameras.

815
00:52:58,379 --> 00:53:02,776
What a waste.
I checked my phone.

816
00:53:02,801 --> 00:53:04,699
St. 8 pm.

817
00:53:04,924 --> 00:53:07,021
We slept for 7 hours.

818
00:53:07,046 --> 00:53:10,543
The TC was going to eat a sandwich e. ??..

819
00:53:10,568 --> 00:53:11,166
They have to see it.

820
00:53:17,385 --> 00:53:20,482
Lance! It smells bad
shut that shit!

821
00:53:21,507 --> 00:53:24,703
What are you doing? Close it there!

822
00:53:27,725 --> 00:53:30,122
All our food is so but
we still have plenty of water so ...

823
00:53:30,347 --> 00:53:32,445
I do not know, we should be fine.

824
00:53:36,566 --> 00:53:38,164
Why not try to go through the tunnels?

825
00:53:38,189 --> 00:53:41,385
Kenny said that the tunnels
unite all the buildings.

826
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:44,608
Maybe we can find a
Output in other buildings.

827
00:53:44,633 --> 00:53:46,531
You see the Great Wall of China?

828
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:49,352
I'm not going to the tunnels ...
If the lights go out we're fucked.

829
00:53:49,377 --> 00:53:52,374
Remember when you asked me
to record the sunset?

830
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:55,946
I saw a fire exit.
If we ascend to the roof,

831
00:53:55,947 --> 00:53:57,494
maybe we can go down the
climbing and general merchandise here.

832
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:00,066
So how?
We will stay here or ...

833
00:54:00,067 --> 00:54:03,514
I do not care what we
only do we get out of here man!

834
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:07,634
I do not want to be here.
Guys, want to do all this?

835
00:54:07,659 --> 00:54:09,657
On the roof! Okay, okay!

836
00:54:09,682 --> 00:54:12,779
Let's get the equipment
whole, and let's go.

837
00:54:14,702 --> 00:54:16,399
Give me a little personal light.
Sorry.

838
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,618
Let's here?

839
00:54:23,643 --> 00:54:25,741
Lance? Where? No, no, no!

840
00:54:25,766 --> 00:54:27,013
TC said you knew where it was.

841
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:29,261
I said nothing!
Do not put the blame on me.

842
00:54:29,286 --> 00:54:34,582
I do not know where it was said.
I said I had stairs.

843
00:54:34,607 --> 00:54:36,854
What does that
matter now?

844
00:54:36,855 --> 00:54:38,102
That's why we came.
I saw the outside.

845
00:54:38,127 --> 00:54:39,326
Ok! Fuck!

846
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:43,847
I can not do it guys!

847
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:47,467
What the fuck was that?!

848
00:54:48,692 --> 00:54:50,590
Hello! Someone up here?

849
00:54:50,115 --> 00:54:52,913
TC! Is there?

850
00:54:52,014 --> 00:54:54,334
I do not ask questions.
Stairs or not?

851
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:56,658
Let's get together.

852
00:54:57,782 --> 00:54:59,630
Listen, keep the light
connected in front of me.

853
00:54:59,631 --> 00:55:00,478
Move it, move it go!

854
00:55:01,503 --> 00:55:04,800
Get out of my fucking face!
Out of my way!

855
00:55:05,924 --> 00:55:06,122
Wait guys! Slowly.

856
00:55:06,147 --> 00:55:08,145
What's wrong with you man?

857
00:55:11,768 --> 00:55:14,665
Yes! Yes! (Access to roof)

858
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,881
No way!

859
00:55:22,906 --> 00:55:25,903
Shut up and secure it. I see!

860
00:55:30,623 --> 00:55:32,221
It's solid ass!

861
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:35,242
What do you think?
It seems that there is a long time?

862
00:55:35,267 --> 00:55:37,465
Makes no sense.

863
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:40,988
Fuck!

864
00:55:41,512 --> 00:55:44,709
The fucking camera away from me!

865
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:50,227
What do you think? I do not know, I do not know.

866
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:08,934
Just left of the stairs.
Was completely sealed at the top!

867
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,456
I will document this
all, when we leave

868
00:56:10,457 --> 00:56:13,954
here, people will
want to see it.

869
00:56:16,576 --> 00:56:19,472
See it!
Here we climbed the stairs, right?

870
00:56:19,497 --> 00:56:21,195
This puts us on the 4th floor.

871
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:25,817
We came here, we
be here at least, right?

872
00:56:25,842 --> 00:56:27,540
Are you sure? I do not know ...

873
00:56:27,565 --> 00:56:28,363
TC, this ... Lance! Lance!

874
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:30,587
What, what?

875
00:56:30,211 --> 00:56:34,807
We are here? Can not ...
Nor is there stairs!

876
00:56:34,832 --> 00:56:36,830
It means nothing.

877
00:56:36,831 --> 00:56:38,828
This means that
we are on the 1st floor.

878
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:42,849
Remember that we
we came here right?

879
00:56:43,773 --> 00:56:48,968
TC, can you film it?
Yes, I'm shooting.

880
00:56:48,993 --> 00:56:50,891
This is so fucked!

881
00:56:51,715 --> 00:56:54,211
Fuck! What, what?

882
00:56:54,236 --> 00:56:56,035
What the fuck? Did you hear that?

883
00:56:56,059 --> 00:56:58,357
Did you hear? What the fuck was that?

884
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:02,278
What is this? Matt? Matt?

885
00:57:04,301 --> 00:57:07,098
Fuck! Matt! On this side!

886
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:13,117
Matt, are you?

887
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:19,036
Staff will return! Matt!

888
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:22,058
Not here. Not here!

889
00:57:24,581 --> 00:57:25,279
That just move?!

890
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,798
Let's fuck out of here!

891
00:58:01,093 --> 00:58:04,990
We had all day to try
find a ladder.

892
00:58:07,612 --> 00:58:09,309
I do not know.
We could not find any.

893
00:58:09,334 --> 00:58:11,533
This building is a maze of shit!

894
00:58:12,857 --> 00:58:14,955
That's what the TC says. It is as if this

895
00:58:14,956 --> 00:58:16,052
will always
change around us.

896
00:58:19,575 --> 00:58:22,572
We have not yet
find Matt.

897
00:58:22,597 --> 00:58:24,494
I do not know if he is okay.

898
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:28,715
We should not be seeing so much shit!

899
00:58:33,835 --> 00:58:39,129
We are all tired, hungry.
We are trying to sleep again.

900
00:58:40,253 --> 00:58:43,850
This time we are sleeping in shifts.

901
00:58:43,274 --> 00:58:46,572
So it can always be one to watch.

902
00:58:52,891 --> 00:58:55,887
TC, you're writing? Yes.

903
00:58:57,010 --> 00:59:00,608
We rise now.
You should see this!

904
00:59:00,633 --> 00:59:01,031
Off the fucking camera!

905
00:59:01,056 --> 00:59:03,753
Come Sasha!
We have to document everything.

906
00:59:03,778 --> 00:59:04,077
People have to see it.

907
00:59:04,102 --> 00:59:05,301
Caution! Caution!

908
00:59:07,224 --> 00:59:10,721
Sasha, we will take it,
you have to understand ...

909
00:59:10,746 --> 00:59:12,594
It is impossible for anyone
have come here and

910
00:59:12,595 --> 00:59:13,442
have done it without us
We give for nothing.

911
00:59:14,366 --> 00:59:16,364
Cut! Cut shovel there.

912
00:59:17,789 --> 00:59:19,587
Matt!

913
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:22,009
I swear I heard.

914
00:59:22,034 --> 00:59:23,232
Matt!

915
00:59:25,956 --> 00:59:26,454
Hello!

916
00:59:27,879 --> 00:59:32,574
See? I told you that was
fucking heard! Alive.

917
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:33,497
Matt! Are you okay?

918
00:59:35,521 --> 00:59:37,519
Can you hear me?

919
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:40,240
I'm frozen!

920
00:59:47,658 --> 00:59:49,256
Tell us where you are alone.
We'll pick you up!

921
00:59:52,078 --> 00:59:54,876
Shit!

922
00:59:54,901 --> 00:59:55,100
No longer there!

923
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:57,623
We have to find it.

924
00:59:57,648 --> 00:59:58,246
How do we find the
if not managed

925
00:59:58,247 --> 01:00:00,845
find your way
to the front door?

926
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:03,266
We should not be far off.
These walkie-talkies are a shit.

927
01:00:05,489 --> 01:00:08,687
How do you know what is it?

928
01:00:11,809 --> 01:00:14,105
Matt! Are you here?

929
01:00:15,229 --> 01:00:18,426
Sorry, sorry, sorry! Fuck!

930
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:22,548
Matt! We hear you!
Where are you? Fuck!

931
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:26,968
Sasha tries in all
frequencies.

932
01:00:26,969 --> 01:00:28,866
This is weak, has no
that much reach.

933
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:31,588
How far is that
what was said?

934
01:00:31,589 --> 01:00:32,187
I did not say, was not
specifications.

935
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:38,506
Estimate? 200-300-400?
200 meters to get a clear sound.

936
01:00:38,531 --> 01:00:39,429
Maybe 300 meters ...
We will continue to walk.

937
01:00:39,454 --> 01:00:41,052
Before starting to cause noise.

938
01:00:41,077 --> 01:00:42,276
Stay together, come on.

939
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,598
It's a dead end!
A dead end.

940
01:00:54,515 --> 01:00:56,613
Where are you fucking?

941
01:01:06,727 --> 01:01:08,625
Listen people this is
completely useless right?

942
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:10,148
If it were to find it ...
the scope ...

943
01:01:10,173 --> 01:01:11,371
Fuck!

944
01:01:12,996 --> 01:01:13,895
What the fuck was that?!

945
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:14,119
It was Matt!

946
01:01:22,536 --> 01:01:24,634
What are you doing, man?

947
01:01:28,755 --> 01:01:30,852
Lance! Lance!

948
01:01:31,476 --> 01:01:33,674
Oh fuck!

949
01:01:39,293 --> 01:01:41,391
Do something man.

950
01:01:42,915 --> 01:01:43,914
Lance! Lance!

951
01:01:48,534 --> 01:01:50,032
Who are you? What are you doing here?

952
01:02:07,439 --> 01:02:11,536
Turn off the light! Turn off the light!

953
01:02:12,359 --> 01:02:14,157
Have you seen the fucking her face?!

954
01:02:14,182 --> 01:02:15,381
Shut your fucking mouth!

955
01:02:15,406 --> 01:02:17,604
Have you seen the fucking her face!?

956
01:02:24,321 --> 01:02:27,218
Why is this happening?
Oh my God!

957
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,136
Shit! Shit!

958
01:02:34,161 --> 01:02:38,257
We are lost!
Houston lost the fucking!

959
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,779
Matt!

960
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:50,295
Guys!

961
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,519
Guys!

962
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:57,738
Sasha!

963
01:03:07,753 --> 01:03:08,351
TC!

964
01:03:12,673 --> 01:03:13,271
Lance!

965
01:03:50,659 --> 01:03:52,557
Is anybody there?!

966
01:04:19,353 --> 01:04:21,152
Help me! Guys!

967
01:04:48,949 --> 01:04:50,847
We are here today.

968
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:53,368
The Houston disappeared.

969
01:04:55,192 --> 01:04:59,988
Matt wanted to find the
radio but he does not respond.

970
01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:03,909
What the fuck was that?

971
01:05:04,132 --> 01:05:08,629
Just go to weird shit
around us. Fuck!

972
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:13,248
I do not know how long it will last.

973
01:05:17,869 --> 01:05:19,067
We are not alone.

974
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:27,184
My name is on the bracelet!

975
01:05:27,209 --> 01:05:29,007
How is my name
is in the band?!

976
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:31,805
Fuck!

977
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,325
First scratches on
my back and now ...

978
01:05:37,149 --> 01:05:39,747
What the fuck!

979
01:05:39,772 --> 01:05:40,320
When we wake,
we had one of these ...

980
01:05:40,321 --> 01:05:42,869
have to do this.

981
01:05:42,894 --> 01:05:43,793
Fuck you!

982
01:05:45,616 --> 01:05:50,811
You wanted to get out of there was not?
I did not want!

983
01:05:50,835 --> 01:05:53,533
Vieste is not it? I did not want!

984
01:05:53,558 --> 01:05:55,556
That's it! What an idiot!

985
01:05:55,581 --> 01:05:58,677
What does this mean?
It means we're fucked.

986
01:05:58,702 --> 01:05:59,901
Get it? It is what it means.

987
01:06:00,825 --> 01:06:02,523
This is crazy.

988
01:06:02,548 --> 01:06:03,447
This is crazy shit!

989
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,145
Do not look! Jesus Christ!

990
01:06:34,965 --> 01:06:36,564
What the fuck?!

991
01:06:39,485 --> 01:06:42,082
Is there something! What the fuck?

992
01:06:48,901 --> 01:06:50,599
Enough already!

993
01:06:50,624 --> 01:06:52,722
It is as if we walked in circles.

994
01:06:55,443 --> 01:06:59,640
Still can not find
or Matt Houston.

995
01:06:59,665 --> 01:07:02,662
Stop it! What do you mean, stop what?

996
01:07:02,687 --> 01:07:04,685
Are you kidding?
Fuck more to your program!

997
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:06,107
I am not part of it ... I just ...

998
01:07:06,132 --> 01:07:09,129
I'm just documenting ok?
People will want to see this!

999
01:07:09,154 --> 01:07:15,048
Matt disappeared and the Houston right?
We have to focus on out of here

1000
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:16,172
and find them.

1001
01:07:17,596 --> 01:07:20,393
And you're still doing that shit!

1002
01:07:20,417 --> 01:07:22,116
Okay folks, let's stop a bit.

1003
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:24,939
I just ...

1004
01:07:26,762 --> 01:07:27,360
Fuck it, let's bazaar!

1005
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:37,075
You can not run faster?
Let's fuck!

1006
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,198
Oh my God! Come on!

1007
01:07:40,922 --> 01:07:41,121
No, no, no, no! Arise!

1008
01:07:41,146 --> 01:07:43,844
Are you crazy?! Arise!

1009
01:07:43,369 --> 01:07:45,067
Arise!

1010
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:50,187
I can not, I can not! You know!

1011
01:07:50,212 --> 01:07:54,208
Arise, Arise!
I know, I know.

1012
01:07:54,233 --> 01:07:57,030
Go recovers. Do what you have to do!

1013
01:07:57,055 --> 01:08:00,852
We must continue on!

1014
01:08:01,976 --> 01:08:04,773
Damn! What, what?

1015
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:06,696
I found something! Come here!

1016
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:09,818
That are waiting for fucking? Come on!

1017
01:08:09,843 --> 01:08:10,942
Look!

1018
01:08:12,064 --> 01:08:15,061
Matt? Is he right? I do not know man!

1019
01:08:18,483 --> 01:08:21,781
Matt, get up!

1020
01:08:23,903 --> 01:08:25,901
So you close
shit the room!

1021
01:08:34,617 --> 01:08:38,613
Man, to the jokes!
Matt are you okay?

1022
01:08:39,537 --> 01:08:39,237
Oh fuck!

1023
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:46,655
The patient has some kind
phobia in childhood.

1024
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,978
Matt! Oh my God!

1025
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,798
Arise! Let's go!

1026
01:08:53,823 --> 01:08:55,320
Come on, get up!

1027
01:08:55,345 --> 01:08:58,842
Let us take you back!

1028
01:08:58,867 --> 01:09:00,065
Come on! Here, here!

1029
01:09:00,190 --> 01:09:01,389
Come on!

1030
01:09:04,711 --> 01:09:06,009
Put him in bed, leave it there.

1031
01:09:06,034 --> 01:09:08,332
You see anything? No, we're fine.

1032
01:09:11,954 --> 01:09:14,951
Where were you?
Where did you get those clothes?

1033
01:09:16,774 --> 01:09:20,970
Damn, talk with us!
Look at his wrist.

1034
01:09:20,995 --> 01:09:21,193
Matt? Matt?

1035
01:09:25,414 --> 01:09:27,312
How did these wounds?

1036
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:35,829
Matt! What they'll do?
What did you see?

1037
01:09:36,453 --> 01:09:39,350
I'm sick of this!
We have to leave.

1038
01:09:43,572 --> 01:09:45,919
Yes of course we can leave.
We can go.

1039
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,267
When we are better.

1040
01:09:47,491 --> 01:09:50,389
What? What do you mean
"When we are better"?

1041
01:09:50,413 --> 01:09:52,212
What the fuck does that mean?

1042
01:09:54,935 --> 01:09:56,933
I was not ready.

1043
01:09:57,456 --> 01:10:00,854
The process is slow. But the patient
was responding to treatment.

1044
01:10:00,879 --> 01:10:02,877
He's crazy.
Must be stoned or so.

1045
01:10:02,878 --> 01:10:04,875
Not to say
make sense.

1046
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,397
TC! Shut up! Do not tell me to shut up.

1047
01:10:09,319 --> 01:10:12,216
Do not be sad it's okay.

1048
01:10:18,235 --> 01:10:20,433
It will help you too.

1049
01:10:27,851 --> 01:10:28,250
Oh my God!

1050
01:10:30,973 --> 01:10:32,470
TC! Go check the door!
I've done it.

1051
01:10:32,495 --> 01:10:34,694
Go on!

1052
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:38,915
Come on man.
Make sure that nothing is here!

1053
01:10:46,431 --> 01:10:49,629
We found Matt.

1054
01:10:50,252 --> 01:10:52,350
It's completely fucked.

1055
01:11:04,963 --> 01:11:06,961
The TC is still here with us.

1056
01:11:06,986 --> 01:11:08,784
What?

1057
01:11:08,809 --> 01:11:11,206
It's okay.
What are you doing?

1058
01:11:25,416 --> 01:11:28,913
I do not feel well.

1059
01:11:30,637 --> 01:11:31,435
There is something wrong with me.

1060
01:11:39,452 --> 01:11:43,748
Yes, you're a bit hot.
You must have a fever.

1061
01:11:47,368 --> 01:11:49,366
It takes a lot of water. Thank you.

1062
01:11:49,391 --> 01:11:52,589
Get some sleep. I can not sleep.

1063
01:11:57,509 --> 01:12:00,806
And I think we'll ever get.

1064
01:12:05,726 --> 01:12:07,624
What the hell was this?

1065
01:12:07,649 --> 01:12:08,847
Jesus!

1066
01:12:15,965 --> 01:12:17,463
Come on!

1067
01:12:22,283 --> 01:12:25,080
Come on ... go!

1068
01:12:26,804 --> 01:12:28,502
Quick, here!

1069
01:12:59,195 --> 01:13:02,692
You see anything? What is it?

1070
01:13:03,616 --> 01:13:06,513
There is blood in the bathtub!
There is blood in the bathtub!

1071
01:13:06,538 --> 01:13:08,636
What? Come on!

1072
01:13:08,661 --> 01:13:09,459
We go where man? Come on!

1073
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:16,578
What the fuck?!

1074
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:20,898
Matt? Matt?

1075
01:13:20,923 --> 01:13:22,421
What do these fucking?
TC! Stay away from the bathtub.

1076
01:13:22,446 --> 01:13:24,044
Come on Matt!

1077
01:13:24,069 --> 01:13:26,967
TC! What is it
Cock is doing?

1078
01:13:27,691 --> 01:13:28,190
Fuck, I do not know!

1079
01:13:32,111 --> 01:13:34,309
Oh my God! Oh my God!

1080
01:13:36,832 --> 01:13:38,530
Help me! Help me!

1081
01:13:38,955 --> 01:13:40,653
Turn the tub!

1082
01:13:48,369 --> 01:13:50,768
Gone!

1083
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:51,391
Gone!

1084
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:54,814
Fucking disappeared!

1085
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:56,336
Suddenly gone! Without a trace!

1086
01:15:09,687 --> 01:15:11,685
Shit! No, no!

1087
01:15:17,803 --> 01:15:19,801
It is a lift!

1088
01:15:19,326 --> 01:15:21,224
Open it! Open it!

1089
01:15:21,449 --> 01:15:23,047
Open it! Open it!

1090
01:15:28,267 --> 01:15:30,165
It's just the echo of the elevator.

1091
01:15:31,689 --> 01:15:32,437
If we reach
tunnels, perhaps

1092
01:15:32,438 --> 01:15:34,186
can get out by
other building.

1093
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:43,502
Go there!

1094
01:15:43,727 --> 01:15:44,225
Fuck! Fuck!

1095
01:15:46,849 --> 01:15:52,842
Hear! Watch out Matt,
I'll get some tools.

1096
01:15:53,667 --> 01:15:55,964
Stay here.

1097
01:16:34,249 --> 01:16:36,747
What the fuck is that?

1098
01:16:39,769 --> 01:16:41,667
Jesus! It is a language? Fuck!

1099
01:17:00,172 --> 01:17:03,469
What's up? What's up?

1100
01:17:10,187 --> 01:17:12,685
Bring the light, points to there.

1101
01:17:15,508 --> 01:17:17,405
Here is a ladder. Head down.

1102
01:17:19,628 --> 01:17:20,027
How do we take Matt?

1103
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:23,749
I'll go first and you come
then with Matt ok?

1104
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:29,168
Get away! It is back there.

1105
01:17:30,992 --> 01:17:32,790
Lance! Lance!

1106
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:42,204
Where is the button?

1107
01:17:44,528 --> 01:17:45,727
Oh here it is!

1108
01:18:33,602 --> 01:18:34,201
Is gone?

1109
01:18:35,225 --> 01:18:37,923
I do not know, disappeared.

1110
01:18:38,947 --> 01:18:40,444
Ok ok. Let's go.

1111
01:18:45,665 --> 01:18:47,863
Where is he? Matt!

1112
01:18:50,785 --> 01:18:52,883
Jesus! He jumped! He jumped!

1113
01:19:22,077 --> 01:19:23,275
Come on!

1114
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,598
Relax. You're done!

1115
01:19:32,917 --> 01:19:34,314
It's okay. It's okay.

1116
01:19:48,725 --> 01:19:49,024
The tunnels are here!

1117
01:19:51,747 --> 01:19:53,345
Finally we arrived.

1118
01:19:54,769 --> 01:19:57,966
I can not. I can not go.

1119
01:19:57,991 --> 01:19:59,789
Come on, Sasha!

1120
01:19:59,814 --> 01:20:01,411
Kenny said that connected
all buildings.

1121
01:20:02,135 --> 01:20:04,534
You have to do this to me.

1122
01:20:04,759 --> 01:20:06,657
I can not do this alone!
Ok? Ok

1123
01:20:11,476 --> 01:20:14,973
It is close to me and let's here.

1124
01:20:16,296 --> 01:20:18,194
Should not be too far away.

1125
01:20:25,412 --> 01:20:27,710
Okay, off you go.

1126
01:20:34,528 --> 01:20:38,724
No, no! We've already been here!

1127
01:20:40,547 --> 01:20:42,144
We should not be here! What the fuck?!

1128
01:20:48,764 --> 01:20:49,462
I can not go!

1129
01:20:52,585 --> 01:20:53,183
Wait a minute!

1130
01:21:17,584 --> 01:21:19,081
I want my mother!

1131
01:21:37,488 --> 01:21:39,986
It's day ...

1132
01:21:40,511 --> 01:21:42,508
What day is today?

1133
01:21:45,130 --> 01:21:48,127
I do not know what day it is.

1134
01:21:49,651 --> 01:21:51,999
We spent the whole day
walking in one direction.

1135
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,346
We did not get anywhere.

1136
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:57,367
It pains me much to leg.

1137
01:21:57,392 --> 01:22:03,787
Sasha could.
It will not be able to continue.

1138
01:22:07,107 --> 01:22:09,805
Who's there?

1139
01:22:10,729 --> 01:22:11,428
Who are you?

1140
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:14,188
Sasha?

1141
01:23:24,303 --> 01:23:26,901
Sasha, where are you?

1142
01:23:26,926 --> 01:23:27,925
Where are you?

1143
01:23:53,624 --> 01:23:54,322
Fuck!

1144
01:24:02,839 --> 01:24:04,037
What do you want?

1145
01:24:10,856 --> 01:24:12,854
What do you want?

1146
01:24:34,356 --> 01:24:37,153
I'm running out
battery bit by bit.

1147
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:43,672
Now, I can only connect
lights when needed.

1148
01:24:45,595 --> 01:24:47,893
But I do not need more light!

1149
01:24:50,915 --> 01:24:52,013
Just me walking straight ahead.

1150
01:24:54,136 --> 01:24:56,333
He could continue to walk for hours.

1151
01:24:59,556 --> 01:25:00,155
It's like a game.

1152
01:25:07,272 --> 01:25:09,070
How far can you go?

1153
01:25:11,794 --> 01:25:13,792
If someone is watching this ...

1154
01:25:15,515 --> 01:25:16,714
Fuck you!

1155
01:25:20,034 --> 01:25:21,233
Fuck you!

1156
01:25:22,057 --> 01:25:24,655
Fuck you, fuck!

1157
01:25:26,578 --> 01:25:27,476
This was for you.

1158
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:31,236
Do not you hear anything? Do not you hear anything?

1159
01:26:31,261 --> 01:26:33,059
Do not you hear anything?

1160
01:26:36,381 --> 01:26:39,978
I'm alive!

1161
01:26:44,398 --> 01:26:47,795
I woke up e. ..

1162
01:26:48,619 --> 01:26:50,217
I do not know how long
I was sleeping but ...

1163
01:26:51,941 --> 01:26:53,839
There is a door!

1164
01:26:53,864 --> 01:26:55,062
Look!

1165
01:27:43,137 --> 01:27:45,935
This is not happening.

1166
01:27:47,058 --> 01:27:48,457
This is not happening.

1167
01:27:52,579 --> 01:27:53,477
I must be crazy!

1168
01:28:58,035 --> 01:29:00,734
Jesus!

1169
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:29,028
It is not possible!

1170
01:29:43,339 --> 01:29:46,036
No! I'm not crazy!

1171
01:29:46,061 --> 01:29:50,957
I'm not loco! No! No! No!

1172
01:30:02,870 --> 01:30:04,267
I'm so much better now!

1173
01:30:08,589 --> 01:30:09,788
Finally, I can go home!

1174
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:19,002
Grave Encounters. I'm Lance Preston.

1175
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:25,621
Cut!

1176
01:30:25,622 --> 01:30:28,019
