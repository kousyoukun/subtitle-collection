1
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:50,386
Driver's name is Arthur Shea.

2
00:01:50,952 --> 00:01:55,260
former Medford police officer,
57 years old.

3
00:01:55,422 --> 00:01:57,728
Soon as his partner leaves with
the coal bag...

4
00:01:57,893 --> 00:02:01,266
...Artie cracks The Herald, and he
don't look up till the guy gets back.

5
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:06,269
Marty MacGuire,
Cummins Armored courier.

6
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:10,174
5'10", 220, 52 years old.

7
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:13,344
Picks up every Wednesday and Friday
at exactly 8:12.

8
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:17,181
Makes $110 a day. Carries a SIG 9.

9
00:02:18,045 --> 00:02:20,616
And he's about to get robbed.

10
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,487
We're fucked if we see a helicopter,
we're fucked if we see SWAT.

11
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,190
We see a cruiser, stop, take out
the engine blocks, keep moving.

12
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:29,590
No one needs to get hurt.

13
00:02:29,755 --> 00:02:31,725
Now, these guards
like to test you, though.

14
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:34,830
They want to get hurt for $10 an hour,
don't get in the way.

15
00:02:37,196 --> 00:02:38,232
Let's go.

16
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,455
Move!

17
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,490
All right, now get away
from the counter!

18
00:03:04,656 --> 00:03:06,494
Go! Go! Go! Everybody away!

19
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:07,927
Back against the wall.

20
00:03:08,328 --> 00:03:10,799
You! Away from the computer!

21
00:03:10,963 --> 00:03:13,868
- Give me the fucking key!
- Back up! Back! Go! Go!

22
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:16,404
- Get up! Get up!
- Get the fucking door!

23
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:17,603
Get on the ground!

24
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:20,575
- Get down on the ground.
- Get your fucking ass on the ground!

25
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:22,241
Move!
Go, go, go, go!

26
00:03:24,977 --> 00:03:27,514
- On the floor!
- I need everybody's BlackBerrys.

27
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:30,084
- Everybody on the floor.
- Slide your BlackBerrys up.

28
00:03:30,249 --> 00:03:31,684
Take off your fucking shoes!

29
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,121
BlackBerrys to the front!
Slide your fucking phones up.

30
00:03:35,286 --> 00:03:37,556
- The fuck you looking at?
- Take your shoes off.

31
00:03:38,555 --> 00:03:40,759
Get the cash drawers. Let's go.

32
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:43,763
- Take off your fucking shoes!
- Take off your shoes.

33
00:03:43,927 --> 00:03:45,830
Bank manager, let's go.
Get up. Let's go.

34
00:03:45,996 --> 00:03:47,799
Get up, come on, get up.
Let's go.

35
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:51,304
Not you. You. Get up.
Let's go. Come on.

36
00:03:53,002 --> 00:03:55,005
- You trying to be a hero?
- Jesus Christ!

37
00:03:55,171 --> 00:03:57,309
- When's the time lock set for?
- 9:00.

38
00:03:57,474 --> 00:03:59,176
Don't lie to us, it's 8:15.

39
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:02,482
Listen, it's not your money.
You understand? Don't lie to us again.

40
00:04:02,646 --> 00:04:04,565
Hey, sweetheart, in the corner.
Get in the corner.

41
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,986
You too, brother-man.

42
00:04:19,162 --> 00:04:20,798
Go. Go.

43
00:04:24,869 --> 00:04:27,405
No distress call. Open it clean.

44
00:04:29,306 --> 00:04:31,744
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Don't stall.

45
00:04:32,443 --> 00:04:34,380
This guy a fucking friend of yours?

46
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:40,118
Let's go!

47
00:04:40,284 --> 00:04:42,822
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

48
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:47,325
Take your time, okay?

49
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,993
Breathe. Go.

50
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:07,110
Okay, get back. Get out of the way.

51
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:40,943
Front door.

52
00:05:42,077 --> 00:05:43,914
- Hello.
- Front door.

53
00:05:44,813 --> 00:05:46,816
Hey, you guys open?

54
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,899
We gotta go.

55
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,471
Let's go. Let's bleach it up.

56
00:06:09,638 --> 00:06:12,208
- Go, go, go.
- Let's bleach it up.

57
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,813
- Come on, let's go. We gotta go.
- Hold it. Silent alarm, this address.

58
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,914
- Who did it?
- Look, nobody did anything.

59
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:23,586
- What? Huh? What'd you say?
- Nobody did anything.

60
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,986
- You pull the alarm?
- No. No.

61
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,922
- Did you?
- I didn't pull any alarm.

62
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,458
We were leaving,
you motherfucker! You fuck!

63
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,162
Easy, easy. That's enough.

64
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,434
- All right? Easy.
- You fuck!

65
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,071
You fucker. We were out the door,
you fuck.

66
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,504
Let's go.

67
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,349
Where's your purse?

68
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:05,557
What the fuck is this?

69
00:07:05,723 --> 00:07:08,227
The cops get us walled in,
we're gonna need her.

70
00:07:08,392 --> 00:07:10,295
Sit down. Go.

71
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:22,374
Head for the boulevard.

72
00:07:31,816 --> 00:07:32,851
You're gonna be okay.

73
00:07:33,617 --> 00:07:35,487
All right?
No one's gonna hurt you.

74
00:08:01,945 --> 00:08:03,281
What's up?

75
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:05,365
Boosted a city work van.

76
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,056
Which still hasn't been reported
stolen.

77
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:10,055
Probably too busy working.

78
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,424
Used the van to screen the door.

79
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,693
Bleached the entire place for DNA.

80
00:08:14,857 --> 00:08:17,328
Kills all the clothing fiber,
so we can't get a match.

81
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:19,965
Silent bell
came from cage number two.

82
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:22,132
Assistant manager's at Beth Israel.

83
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:24,968
Our guys waited for the time lock
to expire...

84
00:08:25,134 --> 00:08:27,638
...then they had the manager
open sesame.

85
00:08:28,238 --> 00:08:30,074
Under duress?

86
00:08:30,473 --> 00:08:32,107
I don't know.

87
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:34,142
Ten foot steel safe.

88
00:08:35,543 --> 00:08:37,848
Only as strong
as the guy with the key.

89
00:08:40,114 --> 00:08:41,918
Found the dye packs
and the tracers.

90
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:48,891
Found the van. Torched.

91
00:08:49,056 --> 00:08:51,394
- Where is it?
- Where do you think?

92
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:15,184
Is that where we are now?

93
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:17,654
Where's Jem?

94
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,157
Stopped on the way
to light a couple house fires...

95
00:09:20,321 --> 00:09:22,926
...stick up a liquor store, maybe,
I don't know.

96
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,262
- Are we taking hostages now?
- No, we're not taking hostages now.

97
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:29,599
- You gonna talk to this
fucking asshole? - For one thing...

98
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:31,900
Hey.

99
00:09:32,065 --> 00:09:33,768
Speak of the fucking devil.

100
00:09:34,802 --> 00:09:36,337
You made it.

101
00:09:37,404 --> 00:09:39,308
- Take the scenic route?
- We got a problem.

102
00:09:39,473 --> 00:09:41,509
- What?
- Well, look.

103
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:44,411
So what?

104
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:46,315
What's the matter?
Let me see that.

105
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:48,316
- Fuck.
- Oh, shit.

106
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:51,052
- See the address on that?
- Bitch lives four blocks away.

107
00:09:51,218 --> 00:09:53,456
Yeah, I know
where we are, Gloans. Fuck.

108
00:09:53,621 --> 00:09:55,825
We gonna see this bitch
on the street every day?

109
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:57,191
She didn't see anything.

110
00:09:57,357 --> 00:09:58,760
Jesus, are you sure?

111
00:09:58,925 --> 00:10:01,029
- Taking her for a ride didn't help.
- Yeah.

112
00:10:01,194 --> 00:10:03,899
Oh, fuck.
All right. I'm gonna handle it.

113
00:10:04,064 --> 00:10:05,366
How you gonna handle this?

114
00:10:05,532 --> 00:10:08,171
I'm gonna stalk her
like a fucking A car, we'll find out.

115
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:10,339
- Find out what?
- If she needs to get scared.

116
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:13,208
- She's already scared.
- Well, maybe not scared enough.

117
00:10:18,477 --> 00:10:20,215
Thanks, Kathy.

118
00:10:21,014 --> 00:10:26,023
Ms. Keesey. Special Agent Adam Frawley,
Violent Crimes and Robbery.

119
00:10:26,186 --> 00:10:29,225
Derek here is gonna take some
elimination prints.

120
00:10:29,823 --> 00:10:32,093
I see you've given
a preliminary statement.

121
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:34,362
I want to talk to you
about your abduction.

122
00:10:34,526 --> 00:10:35,661
Okay.

123
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:39,499
- I understand they threatened you.
- Mm- hm.

124
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:42,268
One of them took my license.

125
00:10:42,967 --> 00:10:44,904
And did you try to escape
at any point?

126
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,940
No.

127
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,895
Is there anything you can identify
about the men?

128
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,646
Anything you'd testify to?

129
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:54,281
I didn't try to escape
because they had guns.

130
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,014
I understand.

131
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,686
Then they just let you go?

132
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:02,389
- Yeah. They just let me go.
- Thanks.

133
00:11:03,756 --> 00:11:05,960
Should I have a lawyer here?

134
00:11:07,859 --> 00:11:09,785
This isn't a very civil libertarian
thing of me to say,

135
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,169
but anyone who lawyers up
is guilty.

136
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,434
- I think you're all right.
- Okay.

137
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:20,508
When someone endures
an experience like this...

138
00:11:20,673 --> 00:11:23,444
...there are very often
residual effects.

139
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,912
It's gonna be okay.

140
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,613
Did they say anything?

141
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:31,055
"If you talk to the FBI,
we'll come to your house...

142
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,290
...and fuck you and kill you."

143
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:35,053
Are you gonna take care of it?

144
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,291
- I'll do it.
- Why are you gonna do it?

145
00:11:38,456 --> 00:11:40,459
You're the reason
we're having conversation.

146
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:43,262
- I'm gonna get it done.
- What are you gonna get done? Huh?

147
00:11:43,628 --> 00:11:45,697
You get picked up
for intimidating a witness.

148
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:48,399
You walk within 100 feet of her,
that's 10 years. Okay?

149
00:11:48,564 --> 00:11:49,833
You got two strikes
against you already.

150
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:52,606
They're gonna bury you
under the jail.

151
00:11:54,203 --> 00:11:55,872
How much money's in the sack?

152
00:11:56,037 --> 00:11:57,840
All right, we got 90 a pop.

153
00:11:58,007 --> 00:12:00,277
Minus what I had to shave off
for the Florist.

154
00:12:00,444 --> 00:12:02,914
Hey, Jem, what happened
with the assistant manager?

155
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,918
Yeah. Well, next time Skeletor comes
in the bank with an AK...

156
00:12:07,082 --> 00:12:10,288
...I think he's gonna think twice
about hitting that alarm, isn't he?

157
00:12:10,452 --> 00:12:12,523
He's lucky he just got tuned up.

158
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:21,766
- Hey, Rusty. How you doing?
- Hey, Jem. What's up? How are you?

159
00:12:21,931 --> 00:12:23,601
Fergie. Kid's here.

160
00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:27,471
Hey, Fergie.

161
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:30,807
- Here you go.
- How's it going, son?

162
00:12:30,974 --> 00:12:34,347
All right. You run that
under the sink, all right?

163
00:12:35,077 --> 00:12:36,611
Trust me.

164
00:12:42,685 --> 00:12:44,488
All right. Good to see you.

165
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:46,890
Take it easy, man. Good to see you.

166
00:12:49,524 --> 00:12:52,196
Where are they?
What are they doing right now?

167
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,734
They got the money, now they have to
clean it. Casinos. Tracks.

168
00:12:56,897 --> 00:12:59,469
Maybe they make a big drug buy,
flip it across town.

169
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,168
They want to go celebrate, right?

170
00:13:01,335 --> 00:13:05,175
B.P.D., DEA, I want tips,
names, witnesses, anything.

171
00:13:05,338 --> 00:13:08,378
We're gonna knock on some doors,
see who wants to help us out.

172
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:11,580
Any questions? No?
Great. Let's go.

173
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:19,153
What's going on, pal?

174
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:20,420
What up?

175
00:13:20,586 --> 00:13:21,922
Hey, there he is.

176
00:13:22,088 --> 00:13:23,290
- Boom.
- Sober Jackson.

177
00:13:23,457 --> 00:13:25,426
- What's up?
- Hey, hey. Krista's here.

178
00:13:26,794 --> 00:13:28,129
Go on, tell the story.

179
00:13:28,294 --> 00:13:31,734
Dougy, sit down. I'm trying to tell
these motherfuckers about your father.

180
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:34,737
The feds will never understand
the guy who's facing 40 years.

181
00:13:34,902 --> 00:13:38,409
Gonna give him the opportunity to walk
scot-free if he gives up his friends.

182
00:13:38,572 --> 00:13:40,642
He tells them,
"Suck a dick. Give me the 40".

183
00:13:40,808 --> 00:13:41,910
"Fucking suck a dick."

184
00:13:42,776 --> 00:13:45,113
Yeah, well, here's to Big Mac.

185
00:13:45,979 --> 00:13:47,280
Doing his time like a man.

186
00:13:47,446 --> 00:13:50,419
- That's right.
- Last crew in Charlestown.

187
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,053
I'm gonna get a tonic, I guess.

188
00:13:52,218 --> 00:13:54,188
All right.
Get me an umbrella for my beer.

189
00:13:54,353 --> 00:13:57,826
Let me get a Shirley Temple
with an extra cherry, please.

190
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:01,163
Poor fucking sober bastard.

191
00:14:04,796 --> 00:14:07,100
- Thanks.
- No problem.

192
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,638
Juice?

193
00:14:13,805 --> 00:14:16,042
Yeah. Juice.

194
00:14:16,574 --> 00:14:18,512
Do you want some snappers
to go with that?

195
00:14:18,677 --> 00:14:21,315
- What are you doing?
- I was just playing.

196
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:23,249
Fuck.

197
00:14:24,214 --> 00:14:26,251
My drink.

198
00:14:31,188 --> 00:14:33,626
Heard you got in a fight, Kris.

199
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:36,462
Do I look like I got in a fight?

200
00:14:37,096 --> 00:14:39,733
I don't know. Let me see.
They pull your hoop out?

201
00:14:39,898 --> 00:14:40,933
That's right.

202
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,206
Fucking Somalian started talking shit
when I was with my daughter.

203
00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:47,074
- You were with Shyne?
- All they see are yuppies down here.

204
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:50,211
They think there's no more serious
white people in Charlestown.

205
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,545
So they can fucking talk shit?

206
00:14:52,912 --> 00:14:54,381
No.

207
00:14:56,348 --> 00:14:58,117
Well, do you miss it?

208
00:14:58,282 --> 00:15:00,954
Fucking coke and Oxy
and all that shit? Yeah, I miss it.

209
00:15:02,787 --> 00:15:05,826
We smoked it to the filter,
right?

210
00:15:07,726 --> 00:15:09,463
You know what I miss?

211
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:20,238
There you go.

212
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:22,039
There you go.

213
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:24,642
That's what you want, right?

214
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:27,880
- Yeah.
- Is that what you want?

215
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:32,083
- Say you love it.
- Oh, fuck.

216
00:15:38,922 --> 00:15:40,925
Good night.

217
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:06,949
I'm grateful to be here today.

218
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:10,890
Growing up in Charlestown in,
you know, a small-knit community...

219
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,158
...we took care of each other,
were protected.

220
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:15,225
My friends were really
like my family.

221
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,828
I'm ashamed of the things I done
when I'm out there.

222
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:19,930
I don't know
where I learned these things.

223
00:16:20,096 --> 00:16:23,235
Seven years went by,
and I'd watch Christmas, birthdays...

224
00:16:23,398 --> 00:16:25,167
I didn't know what my son
looked like.

225
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,336
Make a fast buck if we had to...

226
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:31,842
...that progressed
into getting arrested, and...

227
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:34,625
The struggle that you have
within yourself, the loss,

228
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,714
you know what I mean?

229
00:16:35,876 --> 00:16:37,795
The disappointment in yourself.

230
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,952
The anger that turns
into disappointment. The despair.

231
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:42,953
It's like the guy sitting in the bar,
and a priest walks in.

232
00:16:43,117 --> 00:16:44,652
The guy says, "Hey, wait a minute.

233
00:16:44,818 --> 00:16:46,750
I hate to tell you this,
don't waste your time,

234
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,027
but I happen to know
there's no God".

235
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,859
The priest says,
"Yeah, how's that?"

236
00:16:51,024 --> 00:16:54,364
The guy says,
"I was an explorer in the North Pole.

237
00:16:54,528 --> 00:16:57,967
I got caught in a blinding storm once.
Freezing. I was blinded.

238
00:16:58,132 --> 00:17:01,738
Freezing to death. And I prayed,
'If there's a God, save me now'.

239
00:17:01,902 --> 00:17:03,404
Now, God didn't come".

240
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,445
And the priest says, you know,
"How's that?

241
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,279
You're alive.
He must've saved you".

242
00:17:07,441 --> 00:17:08,943
He says, "God never showed up.

243
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:13,151
An Eskimo came along.
Took me back to his camp and saved me".

244
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:16,352
That's Janice. She's my wife
and she's sitting right there.

245
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,420
She's my Eskimo.

246
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:08,667
- How you doing?
- Hey.

247
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:44,567
Excuse me?

248
00:18:45,302 --> 00:18:46,972
Are you doing laundry?

249
00:18:48,171 --> 00:18:49,606
Huh?

250
00:18:49,905 --> 00:18:52,577
I just wondered if you had any change.
The machine is out.

251
00:18:54,344 --> 00:18:56,514
- Can't help you. Sorry.
- Okay.

252
00:18:58,248 --> 00:19:00,418
I can just hang them up
when I get home.

253
00:19:30,513 --> 00:19:32,016
You all right?

254
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:34,853
I'm fine. I'm just...

255
00:19:35,018 --> 00:19:36,653
Are you sure?

256
00:19:41,057 --> 00:19:42,092
You okay?

257
00:19:42,692 --> 00:19:46,165
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine, thank you.
I'm fine, yeah.

258
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:48,066
Well, this is embarrassing.

259
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:50,702
No, you got nothing
to be embarrassed for.

260
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:54,503
Do you need help?

261
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,174
I'm just having a bad week.

262
00:19:59,341 --> 00:20:01,110
I understand.

263
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:04,681
I like to have a good cry
at the nail salon.

264
00:20:07,115 --> 00:20:11,357
Just open right up to the ladies.
They're very understanding.

265
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:14,657
But, you know, you like the Laundromat,
so that's fine.

266
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:25,103
Hey, why don't you let me
buy you a drink.

267
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,738
Make up for letting you down
with the quarters.

268
00:20:27,902 --> 00:20:30,506
You know, see if we can turn
your week around.

269
00:20:31,672 --> 00:20:33,308
What's the worst
that could happen?

270
00:20:33,475 --> 00:20:34,777
FBI! Open the door!

271
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,378
Open the door!

272
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,316
Fuck.

273
00:20:46,521 --> 00:20:47,655
Fuck.

274
00:20:47,821 --> 00:20:49,824
Fucking cocksucker. Get off him.

275
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,539
Jesus Christ, Henry.

276
00:21:05,271 --> 00:21:07,408
Oxy, guns?

277
00:21:08,207 --> 00:21:09,810
It's like townie Christmas.

278
00:21:12,778 --> 00:21:16,417
Minimum federal sentencing,
10 years.

279
00:21:19,186 --> 00:21:20,454
You're gonna need a friend.

280
00:21:22,522 --> 00:21:24,392
And she ain't it.

281
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:29,030
Great girl, though.
She really loves you, I can tell.

282
00:21:29,961 --> 00:21:33,168
Good news for you is you have an alibi
for the Cambridge job.

283
00:21:33,332 --> 00:21:37,106
The good news for me
is I bet you know something about it.

284
00:21:38,337 --> 00:21:40,574
Everyone does trucks.

285
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:43,477
These guys beat the alarm
for the vault.

286
00:21:43,975 --> 00:21:45,678
- Yeah?
- It's what I heard.

287
00:21:45,844 --> 00:21:49,586
A kid, he gets into the junction box.

288
00:21:58,156 --> 00:22:00,361
- There she is.
- Hey.

289
00:22:00,526 --> 00:22:03,030
- All set?
- Yes.

290
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,034
I should have come
get your door for you, huh?

291
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:11,138
What kind of a guy lets you open
your own door like that?

292
00:22:13,471 --> 00:22:14,705
What?

293
00:22:15,672 --> 00:22:17,542
I have to get something
out there...

294
00:22:17,707 --> 00:22:21,181
...otherwise I'll be pretending
to listen to you all night...

295
00:22:21,345 --> 00:22:23,849
...when really I'm thinking about
something else.

296
00:22:25,249 --> 00:22:26,284
Okay.

297
00:22:29,053 --> 00:22:31,490
A few days ago my bank was robbed.

298
00:22:31,654 --> 00:22:35,193
Four men took it over
and opened the safe.

299
00:22:35,592 --> 00:22:38,631
They took me as a hostage.

300
00:22:40,263 --> 00:22:43,068
They blindfolded me
and drove me around.

301
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:48,375
And then they stopped and let me out
over at the beach and...

302
00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:53,045
And one of the guys told me...

303
00:22:53,276 --> 00:22:57,018
...to walk until I felt the water
on my toes.

304
00:22:58,415 --> 00:23:02,289
It was the longest walk of my life.
I kept thinking I'd step off a cliff.

305
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,926
And then I felt the water.

306
00:23:11,794 --> 00:23:13,664
I'm sorry.

307
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,600
It's not your fault.

308
00:23:18,568 --> 00:23:22,709
Anyway, the FBI guy told me
it would feel like I was in mourning.

309
00:23:22,871 --> 00:23:25,976
FBI? You're working with the FBI?

310
00:23:26,141 --> 00:23:27,576
Mm-hm.

311
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,246
What does that mean?

312
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:34,184
Guy comes by, checks in on you,
gives you a call? That kind of thing?

313
00:23:34,348 --> 00:23:35,918
Pretty much.

314
00:23:36,652 --> 00:23:38,715
They don't have any suspects?
Any clues?

315
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,293
Any leads?
Anything like that?

316
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:43,058
I don't know.
Not that they've told me.

317
00:23:43,224 --> 00:23:46,028
He intimated that they were
scouring Charlestown...

318
00:23:47,395 --> 00:23:50,701
...but they were wearing masks, so...

319
00:23:51,332 --> 00:23:53,704
- Shit.
- Mm.

320
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:58,508
I'm sure I'd recognize their voices
if I heard them again.

321
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:02,879
I don't know,
might be harder than you think.

322
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:07,384
So, what do you do for work?

323
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:10,619
Boston Sand and Gravel.

324
00:24:10,785 --> 00:24:13,790
I break rocks.
Punch a ticket at the end of the day...

325
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:16,825
...slide down the back of
a brontosaurus like Fred Flintstone.

326
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,092
Call it a night.

327
00:24:19,426 --> 00:24:21,330
- Can I ask you something?
- You sure can.

328
00:24:21,495 --> 00:24:23,967
I volunteer at the Boys & Girls Club
in Charlestown...

329
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:25,299
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

330
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:27,125
Well, mostly as a kickball pitcher...

331
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,408
...since they haven't been able
to afford any ice for the rink.

332
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,241
Embarrassing. City won't put
any money into that place.

333
00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:36,211
Yeah, I know. Yeah, well, some
of the kids were calling me a toonie.

334
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:40,382
It just means a yuppie. Someone who's
not from Charlestown, that's all.

335
00:24:40,547 --> 00:24:43,854
- Of course it does.
- They're just being punks.

336
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:52,596
- Hey, Jem. How's it going?
- Hey, B. Can I have a beer? Thanks.

337
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:53,860
- Oh, shit.
- What up?

338
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:57,465
- How you doing?
- All right. Sox got rocked.

339
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:01,702
What's going on?

340
00:25:05,205 --> 00:25:07,242
You, uh, check on that thing?

341
00:25:07,407 --> 00:25:08,509
What?

342
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,812
The license.

343
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,816
- Yeah.
- And?

344
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,020
Nothing. It's a dead end.
We're all set.

345
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:21,455
So no need to remove her
from the equation?

346
00:25:22,055 --> 00:25:25,027
- What?
- You heard me.

347
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:28,262
What are you, a triggerman now?

348
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,564
Just loose ends, kid.

349
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:35,738
You're gonna get the fucking electric
chair brought back over to Charlestown.

350
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,238
Don't be so goddamned panicked,
all right, Dig Dug?

351
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,575
Just, you know, I don't wanna get
backdoored, that's all.

352
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:44,611
- We're fine. All right?
- All right. We're fine.

353
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:47,081
- Okay.
- We're fine.

354
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:51,651
They obviously know
how to work the box.

355
00:25:51,815 --> 00:25:55,856
But I like the way they zapped the BPT
to the D-5 station.

356
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:58,156
How does one learn how to do that?

357
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:01,360
Get a job at Vericom.

358
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:04,163
- Okay.
- Thank you.

359
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:08,034
All right, let's subpoena work logs,
employee records.

360
00:26:08,198 --> 00:26:10,201
Start with everybody
who lives in the town.

361
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:11,802
Got it.

362
00:26:12,236 --> 00:26:13,571
I lied to the FBI.

363
00:26:14,871 --> 00:26:16,407
What?

364
00:26:16,774 --> 00:26:18,276
When the guy attacked David...

365
00:26:18,442 --> 00:26:21,013
...I could see the back of his neck
and he had a tattoo.

366
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,548
Of what?

367
00:26:24,981 --> 00:26:28,154
It was one of those
Fighting Irish tattoos.

368
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:30,856
I'm afraid if I report it
they'll make me testify.

369
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:33,393
What do you think I should do?

370
00:26:36,892 --> 00:26:39,062
Tell the FBI.

371
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:43,370
If the guy's got a record,
and I'm sure he does...

372
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:46,171
...they'll have his tattoos on file.

373
00:26:46,469 --> 00:26:48,639
They'll ring him up the next day.

374
00:26:48,805 --> 00:26:51,810
Robbery, weapons.
He'll get 30 years.

375
00:26:51,975 --> 00:26:55,513
Course, they'll worry someone's
gonna come looking for the witness.

376
00:26:55,811 --> 00:26:57,445
The FBI will probably want to
put you in WITSEC,

377
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,553
you know, Witness Security.

378
00:26:59,715 --> 00:27:03,100
You know, they'll probably put you
somewhere, like, you know, in...

379
00:27:03,492 --> 00:27:06,156
Cleveland or Arizona,
you know, somewhere safe.

380
00:27:08,424 --> 00:27:09,827
Or...

381
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,961
...you could wait.

382
00:27:13,927 --> 00:27:15,897
You have a card.

383
00:27:16,764 --> 00:27:19,101
There's nothing says you gotta play it
right away.

384
00:27:19,267 --> 00:27:22,373
You're the one who's vulnerable
in this situation right now.

385
00:27:22,838 --> 00:27:25,375
The FBI are just people
like anyone else.

386
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,545
They wanna find the bad guy so they
can go home and nuke their supper.

387
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,782
You have to look out
for yourself, Claire.

388
00:27:33,748 --> 00:27:35,384
Quite an expert.

389
00:27:37,386 --> 00:27:38,955
Not really.

390
00:27:40,489 --> 00:27:41,791
Just watch a lot of TV.

391
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:44,661
I watch a lot of CSI.

392
00:27:44,827 --> 00:27:47,831
So I'm a really big expert
on all this. I know.

393
00:27:47,995 --> 00:27:51,402
And Miami CSI and New York CSI.

394
00:27:51,566 --> 00:27:53,436
All of them, I watch.

395
00:27:53,601 --> 00:27:54,936
You'll be well-prepared.

396
00:27:55,103 --> 00:27:56,505
And Bones.

397
00:27:59,874 --> 00:28:01,265
Do we know each other
well enough...

398
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:05,685
...for me to say
that this truck is a little much?

399
00:28:05,846 --> 00:28:06,981
It's my work truck.

400
00:28:07,146 --> 00:28:10,318
If you have problems with your Prius
I can throw it in the back.

401
00:28:10,483 --> 00:28:12,486
How did you know I had a Prius?

402
00:28:15,087 --> 00:28:18,494
Took a guess. I mean,
it just seemed like a toonie car.

403
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:20,496
- Why, do you really have a Prius?
- Yeah.

404
00:28:20,661 --> 00:28:23,031
- Really?
- I had a Prius.

405
00:28:23,194 --> 00:28:26,199
- It got vandalized, of course.
- What happened?

406
00:28:26,364 --> 00:28:29,738
Doesn't matter. Now I'm forced to walk
a mile through the projects.

407
00:28:29,902 --> 00:28:33,276
- There were these guys
and they started... - What?

408
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:36,311
I'm not sure if it was the same guys
who trashed my car, but...

409
00:28:36,475 --> 00:28:37,630
They started getting,
you know... It started...

410
00:28:37,635 --> 00:28:39,982
...with yelling
when I walked by...

411
00:28:40,146 --> 00:28:42,383
...and then it got
really aggressive and...

412
00:28:42,548 --> 00:28:43,750
What were they doing?

413
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:46,086
Once glass bottles
started getting thrown...

414
00:28:46,252 --> 00:28:48,385
...I started coming to terms
with not being cool enough...

415
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,194
...to walk through the projects.

416
00:28:50,356 --> 00:28:52,159
They threw bottles at you?

417
00:28:52,325 --> 00:28:55,932
I'm fine. I just have to,
you know, go the long way.

418
00:28:56,329 --> 00:28:58,265
That's all. It doesn't matter.

419
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,968
No. You just have to live with it,
I guess.

420
00:29:01,934 --> 00:29:04,071
You remember what they look like?

421
00:29:09,441 --> 00:29:11,712
I need your help.
I can't tell you what it is...

422
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:15,415
...you can never ask me about it later,
and we're gonna hurt some people.

423
00:29:17,514 --> 00:29:19,451
Whose car are we gonna take?

424
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,895
Townie credit card.

425
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,221
- Who is it?
- Open up.

426
00:29:59,324 --> 00:30:01,294
What the...?

427
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,974
Oh, shit, that hurts, huh?
Is that your throwing hand?

428
00:30:13,404 --> 00:30:16,543
If you're still here in a week,
we're coming back.

429
00:30:17,508 --> 00:30:19,545
Let's go, we're done.

430
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:22,714
Hey.

431
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,950
- What'd you do? - I don't know
what you're talking about.

432
00:30:26,114 --> 00:30:28,084
That's my brother.
What'd you do to him?

433
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,087
I don't know
what you're talking about.

434
00:30:30,252 --> 00:30:32,489
- You don't know?
How about now? - No.

435
00:30:32,655 --> 00:30:34,925
Hey, chill, chill, chill, man.
Chill. Chill, man.

436
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,459
Don't tell me to chill.

437
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:38,261
- Enough. Let's go.
- What'd you do?

438
00:30:38,428 --> 00:30:40,331
- I don't know what you're
talking about. - No?

439
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,600
There goes college soccer.
Hey, look at me.

440
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:47,002
See my face?

441
00:30:47,469 --> 00:30:49,372
Go tell the cops, all right?

442
00:30:49,538 --> 00:30:52,578
But just remember,
I seen yours too.

443
00:30:52,742 --> 00:30:54,579
Fuck.

444
00:31:05,987 --> 00:31:08,927
I can't be up there
killing people, man.

445
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,562
Hey, you brought me.

446
00:31:22,004 --> 00:31:23,039
Desmond Elden?

447
00:31:23,205 --> 00:31:26,110
Yeah, works for Vericom.
Never seen the inside of a jail cell.

448
00:31:26,274 --> 00:31:28,945
Most of these guys got no-show jobs.
Take down a truck...

449
00:31:29,111 --> 00:31:31,015
...foreman goes,
"Yeah, guy was here yesterday".

450
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,652
He shows us a forged timecard.

451
00:31:32,814 --> 00:31:35,718
Can't play them games at Vericom
because it's a public company.

452
00:31:35,883 --> 00:31:37,886
You don't show up,
it's a recorded sick day.

453
00:31:38,052 --> 00:31:40,689
And Dezzy here,
he's got some interesting sick days.

454
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:46,766
BankBoston, Cummins Armored,
Arlington Brinks, Cambridge Merchants.

455
00:31:53,466 --> 00:31:55,435
Jesus Christ.

456
00:31:59,005 --> 00:32:01,542
So do your parents
still live in Charlestown?

457
00:32:01,707 --> 00:32:06,084
No, my father finally
made it out to the suburbs.

458
00:32:06,546 --> 00:32:08,149
What about your mother?

459
00:32:08,581 --> 00:32:11,520
I couldn't tell you.
She left when I was 6.

460
00:32:14,754 --> 00:32:16,256
What happened?

461
00:32:17,357 --> 00:32:19,194
She left.

462
00:32:25,732 --> 00:32:27,134
Okay.

463
00:32:38,443 --> 00:32:40,815
This sound woke me up.

464
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:45,386
At first I didn't know what it was.

465
00:32:46,517 --> 00:32:49,556
Sounded like an animal
that got trapped.

466
00:32:51,989 --> 00:32:54,794
I never heard a man
cry before.

467
00:32:56,761 --> 00:32:59,567
I came downstairs
in my underwear.

468
00:33:00,732 --> 00:33:03,335
I see my father in the kitchen.

469
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:06,071
First thing I remember
was the ashtray.

470
00:33:06,236 --> 00:33:08,707
Must have been a hundred cigarettes
in there.

471
00:33:08,872 --> 00:33:11,377
Ash like a little mountain.

472
00:33:12,677 --> 00:33:14,781
He stopped crying...

473
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:18,553
...was just sitting there watching TV
on a little black-and-white.

474
00:33:18,716 --> 00:33:20,385
No sound.

475
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,391
I think he just didn't know
what else to do.

476
00:33:28,126 --> 00:33:31,999
He looked at me standing there
in the doorway in my Underoos.

477
00:33:34,565 --> 00:33:38,705
He said, "Your mother left.
She's not coming back".

478
00:33:41,338 --> 00:33:43,175
Just like that.

479
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:49,149
Smoking cigarettes and eating
a TV dinner at 6 in the morning.

480
00:33:52,515 --> 00:33:55,720
We lost our dog the year before...

481
00:33:58,254 --> 00:34:00,959
...and I wanted to make
these posters...

482
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:04,829
...in case my mother was lost...

483
00:34:04,994 --> 00:34:06,831
...someone could call us...

484
00:34:06,996 --> 00:34:09,668
...like the guy who found our dog.

485
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:14,900
To this day my father will tell you
he helped me make them posters,

486
00:34:14,905 --> 00:34:15,808
but he didn't.

487
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,780
He sat in the kitchen,
drank a case of beer...

488
00:34:17,785 --> 00:34:19,845
...while I went out by myself
on School Street...

489
00:34:19,908 --> 00:34:22,748
...asking people
if they'd seen my mother.

490
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:25,049
Her name was Doris.

491
00:34:25,214 --> 00:34:30,390
My grandmother had a place that's
a restaurant in Tangerine, Florida.

492
00:34:30,551 --> 00:34:33,456
So I used to imagine
maybe that's where she went.

493
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:40,402
Then I came to terms with the fact
that doesn't really matter, you know?

494
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:45,171
Wherever she went,
she had a good reason to leave here.

495
00:34:46,302 --> 00:34:49,141
She didn't wanna be
my mother anymore...

496
00:34:49,637 --> 00:34:53,812
...and she wasn't coming back.

497
00:34:56,378 --> 00:34:59,751
And now you know a little bit
about my family...

498
00:35:00,249 --> 00:35:02,654
...but I'm still not showing you
my apartment.

499
00:35:04,286 --> 00:35:06,590
How bad can it be?

500
00:35:16,963 --> 00:35:19,369
Oh, yeah.

501
00:35:34,648 --> 00:35:35,850
Desmond Elden.

502
00:35:36,017 --> 00:35:39,723
Systems tech at Vericom,
22 years old.

503
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:43,661
Albert Magloan. Only in Boston
is a guy named Albert Magloan.

504
00:35:43,824 --> 00:35:47,131
Mr. Magloan never met a car
he couldn't boost.

505
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,164
The kind of talented individual...

506
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,805
...that can start
your Cherokee for you...

507
00:35:50,812 --> 00:35:53,072
...while you're still
looking for your keys.

508
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:57,374
James Coughlin. Father was killed
in prison, mother died of HIV.

509
00:35:57,536 --> 00:36:01,043
Shot Brendan Leahey by the cemetery
behind Mishawum when he was 18.

510
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:03,410
Pled it out. When the judge
asked him why he did it,

511
00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:05,216
he said, "I didn't like the kid".

512
00:36:05,379 --> 00:36:07,449
Served nine years for manslaughter.

513
00:36:07,614 --> 00:36:11,320
These guys plan and execute
with sophistication and discipline.

514
00:36:11,484 --> 00:36:14,022
And that is not our boy Coughlin.

515
00:36:14,187 --> 00:36:18,661
We think the architect is this guy,
Coughlin's best friend, Doug MacRay.

516
00:36:18,823 --> 00:36:21,161
Lives in the same house,
dated Coughlin's sister...

517
00:36:21,327 --> 00:36:24,035
...who most likely
mules for the Florist,

518
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:25,903
who used to employ
MacRay's father.

519
00:36:26,064 --> 00:36:28,436
You need a fucking Venn diagram
for these people.

520
00:36:29,368 --> 00:36:34,043
Mac Sr. got life for the Nashua job,
which most of you should remember.

521
00:36:34,205 --> 00:36:36,275
Hijacked a bread truck
up to New Hampshire...

522
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,744
...one of the guards saw his face...

523
00:36:38,909 --> 00:36:41,581
...so they executed both of them
with their own weapons.

524
00:36:41,745 --> 00:36:45,252
Big Mac's legacy is now no A car driver
is allowed to leave the cab...

525
00:36:45,418 --> 00:36:47,588
...even if there's a gun
to his partner's head.

526
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:50,858
MacRay did eight months for
going over the counter at a BayBank...

527
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:53,025
...with a nail gun
after he washed out from pro hockey.

528
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:55,863
- Pro hockey? - Yeah,
he was a big deal for a minute.

529
00:36:56,027 --> 00:36:58,532
Got drafted, went to camp,
and here's the shocker:

530
00:36:58,696 --> 00:37:00,766
Started making trouble,
fighting with guys.

531
00:37:01,267 --> 00:37:02,965
Don't they pay you
to fight in hockey?

532
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,640
No, not the guys
on your own team.

533
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:07,973
MacRay came home,
got into the family business.

534
00:37:08,338 --> 00:37:09,741
Same song, got into OxyContin.

535
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,046
Hockey ship sailed with the narcotics.

536
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:15,682
Now, we are a long way away
from a grand jury here.

537
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:17,749
We'll never get
24-hour surveillance...

538
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:20,487
...unless one of these idiots
converts to Islam.

539
00:37:20,651 --> 00:37:22,488
So we build the case.

540
00:37:22,753 --> 00:37:25,156
All right, let's get to work.

541
00:37:26,522 --> 00:37:28,859
So I've been telling all my friends
about you.

542
00:37:29,025 --> 00:37:31,062
- Oh, yeah? All good, I hope.
- Yeah.

543
00:37:32,128 --> 00:37:33,563
Eh.

544
00:37:33,729 --> 00:37:37,903
Oh, yeah. They say
they're overcome with jealousy.

545
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:40,472
They can't believe your luck.

546
00:37:40,636 --> 00:37:45,277
You moved to Charlestown,
hooked up with a rock-breaking townie.

547
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:48,311
No.

548
00:37:49,544 --> 00:37:52,415
They just think it's a rebound.

549
00:37:52,715 --> 00:37:54,451
A rebound from what, the robbery?

550
00:37:54,617 --> 00:37:56,086
I don't know.

551
00:37:56,252 --> 00:37:59,291
I feel estranged from them
somehow.

552
00:38:01,357 --> 00:38:04,229
What? Why do you look like that?

553
00:38:06,094 --> 00:38:09,836
- My brother died on a day like this.
- When was this?

554
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:13,573
He was little. He had lymphoma.

555
00:38:15,404 --> 00:38:19,344
So now on really sunny days
I always think of someone dying.

556
00:38:21,377 --> 00:38:23,714
That's wrong, isn't it?

557
00:38:24,913 --> 00:38:26,316
No.

558
00:38:26,948 --> 00:38:29,453
I'm sure he'd be glad
you're thinking about him.

559
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,890
This is a good day.

560
00:38:34,055 --> 00:38:36,124
I'm having a good time.

561
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,793
Good.

562
00:38:38,392 --> 00:38:40,897
Then you'll miss me
while I'm gone.

563
00:38:56,342 --> 00:38:58,245
Money, bitch.

564
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:01,882
Pop.

565
00:39:02,883 --> 00:39:06,055
What the fuck you doing here?
Huh?

566
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,822
- Nothing.
- Nothing? What's this?

567
00:39:07,987 --> 00:39:09,623
- Who're you here with, huh?
- No one.

568
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:12,427
- Let's get out of here.
- You're telling me this is yours?

569
00:39:12,592 --> 00:39:14,261
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Fucking Hawaiian pizza?

570
00:39:14,428 --> 00:39:16,030
- Sit down.
- Let's hit the road.

571
00:39:16,195 --> 00:39:18,600
- I gotta go.
- Sit the fuck down. Just sit down.

572
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,013
- Hi.
- Hi.

573
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:35,216
- Hey.
- Claire.

574
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:36,517
- I'm Jem.
- Jim?

575
00:39:36,683 --> 00:39:38,185
Jem. Jem. It's just Jem, yeah.

576
00:39:38,351 --> 00:39:40,188
I'm friend of this loser right here.

577
00:39:40,353 --> 00:39:43,826
- Nice to meet you.
- Sit down, sit down, relax. All right?

578
00:39:51,496 --> 00:39:55,671
So I saw your fucking Avalanche
parked around the corner, so...

579
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:56,969
The Avalanche?

580
00:39:57,135 --> 00:39:59,875
- A truck. - Fucking truck.
His work truck right there.

581
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:03,878
- Dougy's quite the worker.
- Yeah.

582
00:40:04,042 --> 00:40:06,246
Have you two known each other
a long time or...?

583
00:40:06,411 --> 00:40:10,085
Since we were 6.
We're like brothers. Right?

584
00:40:10,848 --> 00:40:13,053
But he's never mentioned a word
about you.

585
00:40:13,218 --> 00:40:15,890
The secrets with this one,
you know, huh?

586
00:40:19,925 --> 00:40:22,730
Did you say your name was Jim
or Jem?

587
00:40:22,894 --> 00:40:26,200
It's Ji... Je...
Well, it's both, actually.

588
00:40:26,365 --> 00:40:28,970
Teachers, when we were growing up,
used to always say:

589
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,606
"Hey, you can have this one.
He's a real gem".

590
00:40:32,205 --> 00:40:34,107
So I guess it kind of stuck.

591
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:37,944
Whatever. I don't know.

592
00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:40,213
So, what do you do
for yourself there, Claire?

593
00:40:40,378 --> 00:40:42,249
Oh, I work at a bank.
I'm a bank manager.

594
00:40:42,414 --> 00:40:45,019
You're a bank manager?
Sounds fun. What bank?

595
00:40:45,716 --> 00:40:48,321
Cambridge Merchants.
Just over there.

596
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:51,993
Cambridge Merchants. Wait, that's
the one that just got robbed, isn't it?

597
00:40:52,157 --> 00:40:53,893
It got robbed, yeah.
It did, yeah.

598
00:40:54,058 --> 00:40:57,497
I read about that.
It's crazy.

599
00:40:57,994 --> 00:40:59,664
So then how is it that you two met?

600
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:00,931
Um...

601
00:41:01,731 --> 00:41:03,868
We met at a Laundromat.

602
00:41:05,001 --> 00:41:06,169
Okay.

603
00:41:06,336 --> 00:41:07,838
Love among the bleach, right?

604
00:41:08,004 --> 00:41:09,774
Hey, it happens more than you think.

605
00:41:14,843 --> 00:41:18,884
Hey, Claire, don't get too used
to your life of leisure here.

606
00:41:19,048 --> 00:41:22,187
Dougy here, he's a real workaholic,
you know.

607
00:41:22,351 --> 00:41:24,824
He's always taking his work home
with him.

608
00:41:24,988 --> 00:41:26,457
Aren't you?

609
00:41:28,992 --> 00:41:30,794
- All right.
- All right, brother.

610
00:41:31,594 --> 00:41:33,531
Take care of yourself, all right?
Be good.

611
00:41:33,697 --> 00:41:35,834
I'll see you at home.
It was nice to meet you.

612
00:41:35,998 --> 00:41:37,335
You too.

613
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:46,980
Well, I guess you haven't been telling
all your friends about me.

614
00:41:53,749 --> 00:41:56,454
Who you following, Jem?
Me or her?

615
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:58,789
I told you, I made the Avalanche.

616
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:02,527
Nothing to worry about.
It's all under control.

617
00:42:02,692 --> 00:42:04,561
Oh, so you're trying to get us
jammed up?

618
00:42:04,727 --> 00:42:06,997
- Is that it?
- I'm trying to get you jammed up.

619
00:42:07,862 --> 00:42:10,299
Tell me you got a move here, Dougy.

620
00:42:10,465 --> 00:42:14,239
Because the only way I see it is you
got sprung like a goddamn bear trap...

621
00:42:14,402 --> 00:42:18,611
...on some toonie pussy who happens
to be the one goddamn person... Fuck!

622
00:42:18,773 --> 00:42:21,912
The one person that can give us
to the fucking feds.

623
00:42:25,112 --> 00:42:28,051
Calm down, all right?

624
00:42:28,281 --> 00:42:30,585
Don't you think we need
to be smart right now?

625
00:42:30,751 --> 00:42:32,789
- Smart?
- Yeah.

626
00:42:34,222 --> 00:42:36,492
Let's start fucking all the witnesses.
All right?

627
00:42:36,657 --> 00:42:37,905
Yeah, I'm blowing
the assistant manager.

628
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:40,866
Am I smart now? Huh?

629
00:42:41,027 --> 00:42:45,301
And no, I didn't tell the other guys,
only because they'd flip the fuck out.

630
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:47,937
And I want them fucking ready
for the next thing.

631
00:42:48,102 --> 00:42:50,239
I told you, the next fucking thing's
not ready.

632
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:51,572
Then make it ready.

633
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:55,480
I don't like the guards
on the next thing, all right?

634
00:42:55,643 --> 00:42:57,946
One kid is like fucking G.I. Joe.

635
00:42:58,111 --> 00:42:59,450
He wears the vest
on the outside,

636
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:02,387
tucks his pants
into his fucking combat boots.

637
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,252
The truck's fucking waist-high.

638
00:43:04,418 --> 00:43:07,256
We'll find another truck
with a driver...

639
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:10,225
...who's a fucking fat kid
with his fucking shit untucked...

640
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:13,496
- ...who don't think he's
Special Forces. - Yeah?

641
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,564
All right, look, I know you're
happy in Fuck City over there...

642
00:43:16,729 --> 00:43:19,501
...but I waited nine years in Walpole
for you, motherfucker.

643
00:43:19,665 --> 00:43:21,869
Just nine years, that's all.

644
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:25,171
I'm done waiting.

645
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:29,911
This is the last one.
We're hitting pause after this.

646
00:43:30,843 --> 00:43:34,315
We get pinched,
remember whose idea this was, okay?

647
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,450
Be ready on Friday.

648
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,935
Visitors, straight ahead.

649
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:27,867
- Who you seeing?
- Stephen MacRay.

650
00:44:44,614 --> 00:44:46,116
Twelve.

651
00:44:46,282 --> 00:44:48,953
- Right down there.
- Thanks, Lenny.

652
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:13,414
You all right? Every time I come up
here now it's the red pajamas.

653
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:15,614
You still getting in trouble, Dad?

654
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:19,852
Hey, you know how it is.
I can't take no shit.

655
00:45:20,016 --> 00:45:22,721
You're getting a little old
for that bullshit, aren't you?

656
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,491
Fucking Southie kids.
They wanna run everything.

657
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:28,430
Listen, you put a year together
of good behavior...

658
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:29,163
...and get your points down...

659
00:45:29,325 --> 00:45:31,563
...you get classed out
over to Norfolk, Dad.

660
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:34,732
No one's gonna bother you there.
Nobody fights, you know?

661
00:45:34,897 --> 00:45:37,668
They got fucking Ben 'n' Jerry's
ice cream and shit.

662
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:42,074
Well, some things you gotta deal
with yourself, you know?

663
00:45:46,741 --> 00:45:48,110
All right.

664
00:45:54,582 --> 00:45:59,123
I'm thinking about taking a trip.

665
00:45:59,687 --> 00:46:02,459
- Going dark for a minute.
- Taking heat?

666
00:46:03,058 --> 00:46:05,662
Nah, just making a change.

667
00:46:05,827 --> 00:46:07,530
Yeah, don't tell me.

668
00:46:07,696 --> 00:46:09,065
"Making a change."

669
00:46:09,229 --> 00:46:11,834
Either you got heat or you don't.

670
00:46:13,133 --> 00:46:15,938
I heard a bread truck
got dropped.

671
00:46:16,337 --> 00:46:18,575
Oh, yeah? I didn't hear about it.

672
00:46:18,975 --> 00:46:20,711
Okay.

673
00:46:21,009 --> 00:46:24,749
You got five minutes.
Five minutes.

674
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,416
Let me ask you something.

675
00:46:27,948 --> 00:46:29,584
In case I don't see you again.

676
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,290
How come you never...?

677
00:46:36,457 --> 00:46:38,427
How come you never looked for her?

678
00:46:39,995 --> 00:46:42,132
Uh...

679
00:46:42,529 --> 00:46:44,199
Looked for who?

680
00:46:46,499 --> 00:46:48,068
For Ma.

681
00:46:48,868 --> 00:46:51,673
For my mother.
How come you never looked for her?

682
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:55,110
How come you never tried to call nobody
or look for her, or ask around?

683
00:46:55,273 --> 00:46:57,477
Look, when your mother left...

684
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:02,952
...you cried so hard you were
throwing up. All over the parlor.

685
00:47:04,149 --> 00:47:07,355
So I told you if you looked around
you might find her.

686
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,656
Just to give you an activity.

687
00:47:09,821 --> 00:47:13,061
I didn't think you'd carry it
like a fucking disease.

688
00:47:15,028 --> 00:47:17,767
What, you wanna think
she was an angel?

689
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,833
Go ahead.

690
00:47:20,532 --> 00:47:22,870
But look out your front door.

691
00:47:23,036 --> 00:47:25,740
How many 22-year-old girls
are out there...

692
00:47:25,905 --> 00:47:30,347
...they're fucking around
with kids they don't want...

693
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:34,784
...and, you know,
no sense in their heads.

694
00:47:35,748 --> 00:47:38,786
And your mother wasn't no different.

695
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:41,055
That's the hard truth.

696
00:47:42,055 --> 00:47:45,528
I made my peace with it.
You make yours.

697
00:47:46,025 --> 00:47:50,666
I didn't look for her
because there was nothing to find.

698
00:47:59,737 --> 00:48:03,677
Look, I gotta die five times
before I get out of here...

699
00:48:03,841 --> 00:48:07,380
...but I'll see you again.

700
00:48:08,178 --> 00:48:10,416
This side or the other.

701
00:48:44,481 --> 00:48:45,951
So I saw your picture yesterday.

702
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,723
- Are you sure it was me?
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

703
00:48:52,522 --> 00:48:55,794
- Oh, the Boys & Girls Club?
- Yeah.

704
00:48:55,959 --> 00:48:58,029
It was under
a "local heroes" banner.

705
00:48:58,193 --> 00:49:01,600
Yeah. They got a real low standard
for who qualifies on that.

706
00:49:02,065 --> 00:49:03,601
Apparently you were drafted.

707
00:49:03,766 --> 00:49:09,442
Yeah. I was slow.
And I couldn't skate backwards.

708
00:49:09,704 --> 00:49:12,743
You're supposed to be able to skate
backwards in pro hockey.

709
00:49:12,907 --> 00:49:14,695
But I could shoot, you know?

710
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,417
I could hit anything
with a hockey puck.

711
00:49:18,546 --> 00:49:23,154
But I got drafted and I just didn't do
what it took to make the team.

712
00:49:23,316 --> 00:49:27,958
And when I got a second chance,
I blew that too.

713
00:49:29,489 --> 00:49:32,729
They sent me home and that was it.

714
00:49:32,894 --> 00:49:35,332
I look at that picture
and I see a 20-year-old kid...

715
00:49:35,496 --> 00:49:38,235
...who thinks he's, you know,
got it all figured out.

716
00:49:39,534 --> 00:49:43,173
Right before he's about
to throw it all away.

717
00:49:54,215 --> 00:49:57,119
Hey, I don't wanna rush anything,
but can we go into your room?

718
00:49:57,284 --> 00:50:00,088
Because my uncle the bus driver
lives right across the way...

719
00:50:00,252 --> 00:50:03,059
...and he can see
right into this apartment.

720
00:50:04,526 --> 00:50:06,897
- Yes.
- Okay.

721
00:50:43,063 --> 00:50:45,400
They win the game in overtime.
Then you flip it over.

722
00:50:45,565 --> 00:50:47,167
Then you go back to Fenway Park.

723
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:50,072
Then you get another great ending
to another...

724
00:51:42,619 --> 00:51:44,723
...99, we walked through.

725
00:51:44,888 --> 00:51:47,292
Nothing appears disturbed.

726
00:51:48,825 --> 00:51:50,662
In this apartment anyway.

727
00:51:50,827 --> 00:51:52,496
Where the fuck's the truck?

728
00:51:53,231 --> 00:51:55,535
We shut and locked the door,
but...

729
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:58,204
- What happened to 8:45?
- Late is what happened.

730
00:51:58,368 --> 00:51:59,937
Fucking douche bag.

731
00:52:23,427 --> 00:52:25,964
Say your prayers. Here we go.

732
00:52:29,433 --> 00:52:30,968
Here we go.

733
00:52:49,118 --> 00:52:50,621
Gun!

734
00:52:51,987 --> 00:52:53,656
Don't move!

735
00:52:58,659 --> 00:53:00,596
- Go! Go!
- Get back! Get back!

736
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,799
Get out of the way!

737
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:15,144
Any units in the area,
10-61 in progress.

738
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:16,612
The call went out!

739
00:53:17,713 --> 00:53:19,215
Fuck.

740
00:53:19,714 --> 00:53:22,119
Get out here, asshole,
I got your friend.

741
00:53:22,385 --> 00:53:25,424
Calm down. Put your gun away,
all right? You're gonna get hurt.

742
00:53:25,587 --> 00:53:28,123
Put that fucking gun down now.
I got you, motherfucker.

743
00:53:29,556 --> 00:53:31,059
Jesus!

744
00:53:32,694 --> 00:53:35,031
You should have stayed
in the truck, cunt.

745
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:36,665
Let's go!

746
00:53:38,733 --> 00:53:40,102
What the fuck just happened?

747
00:53:40,268 --> 00:53:43,741
- Goddamn it, I fucking told you.
- Fucking shut the fuck up, all right?

748
00:53:43,904 --> 00:53:45,439
- Fucking knew it.
- Goddamn it!

749
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:47,630
All right, drive.
Just take it easy, all right?

750
00:53:47,636 --> 00:53:50,549
Take it easy.
Drive slow. Drive normal.

751
00:53:54,046 --> 00:53:55,314
- Shit.
- Ah, fuck.

752
00:53:56,682 --> 00:53:58,953
They must have been
around the corner.

753
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:42,430
Driver, turn your engine off.

754
00:54:42,995 --> 00:54:45,265
Hands where I can see them.

755
00:54:46,466 --> 00:54:47,501
Fuck.

756
00:54:47,666 --> 00:54:50,872
Shut the engine off now.
Put your hands in the a...

757
00:54:58,843 --> 00:55:01,047
Hit the engine block!

758
00:55:03,347 --> 00:55:04,682
Go, go, go, go, go!

759
00:55:28,006 --> 00:55:30,510
Go to the fucking switch!

760
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:40,385
Fuck!

761
00:55:48,192 --> 00:55:49,995
How do you like that,
motherfucker?

762
00:56:02,706 --> 00:56:04,175
Let's go, let's go!

763
00:56:04,341 --> 00:56:05,943
- It's Dez.
- Let's go, let's go!

764
00:56:06,109 --> 00:56:07,411
Drop it!

765
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:20,925
Let's go!

766
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,242
Dino.

767
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:41,712
What?

768
00:56:42,277 --> 00:56:43,379
Close the bridge.

769
00:56:44,446 --> 00:56:47,586
- What?
- Close the fucking bridge.

770
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:08,372
Alpha 101,
Alpha 412, Alpha 407...

771
00:57:08,537 --> 00:57:10,707
...en route to the north end
of the bridge.

772
00:57:10,872 --> 00:57:13,009
They're going for the bridge.

773
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:55,050
Now, that's how you drive
a fucking car.

774
00:58:11,097 --> 00:58:13,501
All the DNA in Charlestown.

775
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:47,032
You print the inside of the van?

776
00:58:47,197 --> 00:58:49,401
Frawl, the inside of the van
is a volcano.

777
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:53,241
Just find something and make it look
like something that looks like a print.

778
00:58:54,272 --> 00:58:56,409
We don't have enough
for a conviction. Fine.

779
00:58:56,807 --> 00:58:58,577
But I need to get them in a room.

780
00:58:58,775 --> 00:59:02,114
Right now, they are burning the money
bands at some bullshit safe house.

781
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,118
All their alibis were paid for
a week in advance.

782
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:08,489
We're not gonna pull any DNA
off of this or off the switch car.

783
00:59:08,654 --> 00:59:11,993
And that, as they say, is that.

784
00:59:12,657 --> 00:59:14,800
This is the "not fucking around"
crew.

785
00:59:15,005 --> 00:59:16,565
So, find me something
that looks like a print...

786
00:59:16,728 --> 00:59:19,499
...so I can grab one of these assholes
and shake their tree.

787
00:59:19,663 --> 00:59:22,302
This "not fucking around" thing
is about to go both ways.

788
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:46,189
Turn around for me, will you?

789
00:59:58,133 --> 01:00:00,337
Go ahead,
just read what's on that paper.

790
01:00:03,305 --> 01:00:07,045
"Come here, get on the ground,
before I pop your fucking teeth out!"

791
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:11,983
Come on, read it. Read it all.
There's about five things there.

792
01:00:12,716 --> 01:00:14,585
Uh...

793
01:00:15,351 --> 01:00:17,189
What is it with you guys
in Charlestown?

794
01:00:17,354 --> 01:00:20,393
Don't they teach you how to read?
There's things here. Read them.

795
01:00:20,557 --> 01:00:22,827
I don't wanna read that.
This doesn't sound right.

796
01:00:22,992 --> 01:00:26,164
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.
Read the pages, please.

797
01:00:26,329 --> 01:00:28,498
I'm trying to make this
sound authenticious.

798
01:00:28,664 --> 01:00:30,969
- You got it all fucked up.
- Authen-what?

799
01:00:33,737 --> 01:00:35,239
Thanks.

800
01:00:35,404 --> 01:00:38,209
- Hey, Dougy. How are you?
- Oh.

801
01:00:40,042 --> 01:00:41,677
How you doing?

802
01:00:41,843 --> 01:00:43,780
Local crime fighter.

803
01:00:44,046 --> 01:00:45,680
What's happening, Dino?

804
01:00:46,748 --> 01:00:48,318
I know your father.

805
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:52,788
Yeah. Me too.

806
01:00:52,953 --> 01:00:55,057
Got a few years left on his bid.

807
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:57,727
Yeah, one or two.

808
01:00:58,927 --> 01:01:01,264
I hear they got to the old guy.

809
01:01:01,896 --> 01:01:03,564
Split him up the back.

810
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:04,998
Fucking animals.

811
01:01:05,399 --> 01:01:07,903
You'd think they'd go after
a younger kid.

812
01:01:08,202 --> 01:01:11,206
I don't know.
Making a statement, I guess.

813
01:01:11,572 --> 01:01:13,944
Townie crews ain't
what they used to be.

814
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:16,878
Dorchester...

815
01:01:17,044 --> 01:01:18,312
...Southie...

816
01:01:18,912 --> 01:01:20,882
...looking to make a move.

817
01:01:21,982 --> 01:01:24,152
Maybe you can change all that
when you get up there.

818
01:01:26,316 --> 01:01:29,088
Let me ask you a question.
What do you call a guy...

819
01:01:29,254 --> 01:01:32,493
...who grows up with a group of people,
gets to know their secrets...

820
01:01:32,657 --> 01:01:34,727
...because they trust him,
and then turns around...

821
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:38,664
...and use those secrets against them,
put those people in prison?

822
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:42,268
You'd call him a rat, right?
You know what I call him?

823
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:44,102
Dino the dago.

824
01:01:44,268 --> 01:01:47,107
Those people made you
a part of that community.

825
01:01:47,304 --> 01:01:49,106
What did they get for it?

826
01:01:49,573 --> 01:01:51,843
Inside of the fucking can.

827
01:01:53,346 --> 01:01:56,918
You know we lifted a print
off the van? Right?

828
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,359
Special Agent Frawley...

829
01:02:07,658 --> 01:02:08,693
...Douglas MacRay.

830
01:02:11,563 --> 01:02:13,231
You and your boys didn't just...

831
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:18,138
...roll a Star Market
over in Malden for a box of quarters.

832
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:20,504
No, you decided to bang it out...

833
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:24,011
...in the North End at 9:00
in the morning. With assault rifles.

834
01:02:24,975 --> 01:02:28,314
You fucking dummies shot a guard.

835
01:02:29,613 --> 01:02:33,420
Now you're like a half-off sale
at Big and Tall. Every cop is in line.

836
01:02:33,584 --> 01:02:35,421
Fortunately, though, for you...

837
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:38,358
...this guard,
who is two-thirds to a retard...

838
01:02:38,523 --> 01:02:40,125
...has miraculously clung to life.

839
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:41,927
Now, if it were up to me...

840
01:02:42,093 --> 01:02:44,832
...and they gave me two minutes
and a wet towel...

841
01:02:45,196 --> 01:02:47,499
...I would personally asphyxiate
this half-wit...

842
01:02:47,664 --> 01:02:49,868
...so we could string you up
on a federal M1...

843
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:52,238
...and end this story
with a bag on your head...

844
01:02:52,403 --> 01:02:55,241
...and a paralyzing agent
running through your veins.

845
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,779
This isn't fucking townie hopscotch
anymore, Doug.

846
01:03:01,378 --> 01:03:03,648
But I did want to say one thing.

847
01:03:05,147 --> 01:03:07,484
You're here today
so I could personally tell you...

848
01:03:07,649 --> 01:03:10,621
...that you are going to die
in federal prison.

849
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:13,657
And so are all your friends.

850
01:03:14,021 --> 01:03:15,591
No deal.

851
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:17,192
No compromise.

852
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:20,464
And when that day comes...

853
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,533
...when you start trying to be
my hero collaborator so hard...

854
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:26,670
...that I have to slap you
to shut up... And it will come...

855
01:03:26,835 --> 01:03:32,712
...despite your pitiable,
misguided, Irish omerta.

856
01:03:32,874 --> 01:03:36,382
...when your code of silence
finally gives way...

857
01:03:36,545 --> 01:03:41,621
...to fear of trafficking in cigarettes
to prevent sexual enslavement...

858
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:43,945
...I just want you to know...

859
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:47,794
...that it's gonna be me
who tells you to go fuck yourself.

860
01:03:52,561 --> 01:03:56,936
Hey, next time you guys wanna take
pictures of me, just call ahead.

861
01:03:57,098 --> 01:03:59,234
You know, we can do better
than a barbeque.

862
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,638
A calendar shoot. You know?

863
01:04:01,804 --> 01:04:03,506
Maybe topless, lubed up.

864
01:04:03,672 --> 01:04:05,574
Whatever you guys are into.

865
01:04:06,507 --> 01:04:09,045
FBI car antennas
are half-inch matte black...

866
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:11,948
...about three-quarters the way down
the rear windshield.

867
01:04:12,113 --> 01:04:13,348
Statie are pigtailed...

868
01:04:13,514 --> 01:04:15,283
...B.P.D., half and half.

869
01:04:15,682 --> 01:04:19,723
Every peewee in the town knows
what an FBI rear antenna looks like.

870
01:04:19,886 --> 01:04:23,526
So, in the future, if you guys
are gonna try to be slick...

871
01:04:24,223 --> 01:04:26,293
...be slicker than a 6-year-old.

872
01:04:27,026 --> 01:04:28,763
I gotta get back to work.

873
01:04:29,095 --> 01:04:30,697
Can I go?

874
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:36,137
Good luck with that print.

875
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:08,234
Good morning,
Cambridge Savings.

876
01:05:08,399 --> 01:05:11,105
Claire Keesey, please.
She's the manager.

877
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:14,109
Oh, she's no longer working here.

878
01:05:14,273 --> 01:05:15,676
- Since when?
- Friday.

879
01:05:15,722 --> 01:05:16,855
Just get the warrant.

880
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:19,850
Land, cell, e-mail, fax, Skype.
The whole fucking thing.

881
01:05:24,818 --> 01:05:26,987
Why didn't you tell me
you quit your job?

882
01:05:27,151 --> 01:05:28,186
I don't know.

883
01:05:28,353 --> 01:05:30,356
Why don't you tell me
what's in the box?

884
01:05:30,555 --> 01:05:32,025
- What, this?
- Mm-hm.

885
01:05:32,423 --> 01:05:38,368
Anybody call you or say anything to you
or anything like that? After?

886
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:39,599
Mm. Nope.

887
01:05:39,765 --> 01:05:41,802
No? Well, what are you gonna do?

888
01:05:41,967 --> 01:05:43,301
You know what? I don't know.

889
01:05:43,468 --> 01:05:48,043
I can teach,
volunteer full-time.

890
01:05:48,205 --> 01:05:49,641
I have a little saved.

891
01:05:49,807 --> 01:05:51,242
So...

892
01:05:52,777 --> 01:05:55,182
What if I told you
I was gonna quit my job too?

893
01:05:56,247 --> 01:05:57,983
Well, then I guess
I'd have company.

894
01:05:58,883 --> 01:06:01,521
We'd do it together. Here.

895
01:06:01,953 --> 01:06:04,223
It's just a necklace, that's all.

896
01:06:06,323 --> 01:06:08,461
Why don't we go away together.

897
01:06:08,627 --> 01:06:11,198
Take a trip for a minute, you know?
Something like that.

898
01:06:11,362 --> 01:06:13,532
You know, just fun.

899
01:06:14,098 --> 01:06:15,133
Doug.

900
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:17,569
Is it right?
Took me forever trying to pick it.

901
01:06:17,734 --> 01:06:21,006
- Arguing with the lady, and...
- It's beautiful, but it...

902
01:06:21,172 --> 01:06:23,709
Well, as long as you didn't,
you know, sell your truck.

903
01:06:23,875 --> 01:06:26,112
Someone took over the payments.

904
01:06:28,012 --> 01:06:30,182
You know, people get up every day...

905
01:06:30,347 --> 01:06:32,752
...tell themselves
they're gonna change their lives.

906
01:06:32,917 --> 01:06:34,653
They never do.

907
01:06:35,685 --> 01:06:37,688
I'm gonna change mine.

908
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:40,157
Why don't you do it with me.

909
01:06:41,958 --> 01:06:45,030
Okay, well, where would we go?

910
01:06:45,193 --> 01:06:47,965
Come with me, I don't care.
We could go wherever you want.

911
01:06:48,363 --> 01:06:51,771
I mean, you know,
there's things...

912
01:06:52,435 --> 01:06:55,206
There's a few things
you still don't know about me.

913
01:06:57,006 --> 01:06:58,508
What do you mean?

914
01:06:59,374 --> 01:07:03,449
Nothing. I just understand if you have
some reservations, you know?

915
01:07:03,613 --> 01:07:05,515
Between the kind of things
people say about me...

916
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:08,322
...and the things
I'm not proud of...

917
01:07:08,484 --> 01:07:09,986
...don't leave a lot of room.

918
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:11,453
I know who you are.

919
01:07:11,621 --> 01:07:12,656
You do?

920
01:07:12,822 --> 01:07:15,894
Yeah, I do. Yeah.

921
01:07:16,257 --> 01:07:18,462
Does that mean
you want to go with me?

922
01:07:19,729 --> 01:07:21,032
Yeah.

923
01:07:22,231 --> 01:07:24,000
Let's start now.

924
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:26,636
Okay.

925
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:30,239
Frawl.

926
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:33,810
What is it?

927
01:07:33,876 --> 01:07:35,995
A phone conversation between
Claire Keesey and a burner cell

928
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,783
about an hour ago.

929
01:07:37,947 --> 01:07:40,518
See if you can recognize the voice.

930
01:07:41,616 --> 01:07:43,920
Hey, can I come over?
I want to talk to you.

931
01:07:44,085 --> 01:07:45,954
Yeah.
Where have you been?

932
01:07:46,353 --> 01:07:47,755
Sorry, I got held up.

933
01:07:47,921 --> 01:07:49,758
I'm coming over from my place.

934
01:07:49,923 --> 01:07:51,893
Will you come down the back
and let me in?

935
01:07:54,728 --> 01:07:56,965
Hadn't realized you'd left
your job at the bank.

936
01:07:57,965 --> 01:08:01,672
Uh... Oh, yeah. Yeah. Last week.

937
01:08:03,569 --> 01:08:05,906
I'm sorry,
was I supposed to notify someone?

938
01:08:10,643 --> 01:08:12,278
Fancy.

939
01:08:12,512 --> 01:08:14,082
Yeah. It was a gift.

940
01:08:20,586 --> 01:08:22,656
We have our suspects.

941
01:08:24,091 --> 01:08:26,662
I came by to share this
with you.

942
01:08:29,997 --> 01:08:32,000
James Coughlin.

943
01:08:32,231 --> 01:08:34,201
Albert Magloan.

944
01:08:35,535 --> 01:08:37,071
Desmond Elden.

945
01:08:37,236 --> 01:08:40,174
Part of a crew that we tied
into the bank job at North End...

946
01:08:40,338 --> 01:08:44,413
...and at least three other
armored car robberies.

947
01:08:48,881 --> 01:08:50,417
Look familiar?

948
01:08:53,086 --> 01:08:55,623
You opened the safe for him.

949
01:08:56,387 --> 01:08:58,792
He left you unharmed...

950
01:08:58,957 --> 01:09:01,195
...and now the two of you
are carrying on a relationship...

951
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:04,034
...about which you lied to the FBI.

952
01:09:04,196 --> 01:09:05,264
I was wrong.

953
01:09:06,263 --> 01:09:08,333
You do need a lawyer.

954
01:09:16,107 --> 01:09:17,743
Something wrong with the apartment?

955
01:09:17,908 --> 01:09:20,145
No. Florist.

956
01:09:21,045 --> 01:09:22,213
Florist? What?

957
01:09:22,378 --> 01:09:23,882
Came through.

958
01:09:24,348 --> 01:09:27,620
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- It's large, Dougy.

959
01:09:27,785 --> 01:09:29,955
- It's large.
- We're smoked. Punt it.

960
01:09:30,354 --> 01:09:34,528
Look, pick up an extra guy. All right?
Or go with three guys.

961
01:09:34,692 --> 01:09:36,929
Or fucking be smart and boot it.

962
01:09:37,094 --> 01:09:39,065
Oh, so you're not going?

963
01:09:40,232 --> 01:09:41,500
No.

964
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,702
And why's that?

965
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:47,207
Because we got a ton of heat on us,
for one thing.

966
01:09:47,371 --> 01:09:49,807
We'll put a move on.
We've done it a hundred times.

967
01:09:49,973 --> 01:09:53,013
You know what? Forget it.
Do what you want to do. I'm done.

968
01:09:53,177 --> 01:09:54,813
- What? What?
- I'm done.

969
01:09:54,979 --> 01:09:57,283
- You're done?
- What does it sound like?

970
01:09:57,447 --> 01:10:00,152
- I don't know. What's that mean?
- What you think it means?

971
01:10:00,316 --> 01:10:02,635
What does that mean "you're done"?
Sounds like a bunch of bullshit.

972
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,535
Let me put it to you this way...

973
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:06,893
I'm putting this whole fucking town
in my rear-view.

974
01:10:09,259 --> 01:10:11,630
There's people I can't let you
walk away from.

975
01:10:11,794 --> 01:10:13,029
What?

976
01:10:13,729 --> 01:10:15,131
Who?

977
01:10:16,732 --> 01:10:18,167
Come on.

978
01:10:20,971 --> 01:10:23,074
Are you serious, Jimmy?

979
01:10:23,773 --> 01:10:25,275
She's not my kid.

980
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:29,247
Did she tell you it was?

981
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:32,517
I mean, come the f...
Cut it out.

982
01:10:32,681 --> 01:10:34,752
All you give a fuck about
is coke and Xbox...

983
01:10:34,918 --> 01:10:37,790
...now you're trying to play it off
like you care about Shyne?

984
01:10:37,954 --> 01:10:40,859
Know what your problem is?
You think you're better than people.

985
01:10:41,024 --> 01:10:43,696
Mr. Fucking-Clean.
Mr. Fucking-Goddamn-High-and-Mighty.

986
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:46,598
I'm better than all these people.
I'm better than everybody.

987
01:10:46,762 --> 01:10:49,034
But you grew up right here.

988
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,901
Same rules that I did.

989
01:10:51,068 --> 01:10:52,904
Who the fuck you think you are?

990
01:10:53,069 --> 01:10:55,774
You aren't letting me
or not letting me do shit, all right?

991
01:10:55,939 --> 01:10:57,609
Here's a little cheat sheet
for you.

992
01:10:57,773 --> 01:11:00,845
It's never gonna be me and you
and your sister and Shyne...

993
01:11:01,009 --> 01:11:02,613
...fucking playing house up there.

994
01:11:02,779 --> 01:11:06,085
All right? You got it?
Get that in your fucking head!

995
01:11:06,249 --> 01:11:09,254
I'm tired of your one-way
fucking bullshit.

996
01:11:09,418 --> 01:11:13,559
If you wanna see me again,
come down and visit me in Florida.

997
01:11:19,427 --> 01:11:20,462
Cunt.

998
01:11:48,722 --> 01:11:50,659
In the 302...

999
01:11:51,458 --> 01:11:54,130
...feds have me dropping Brendan
right here.

1000
01:11:55,695 --> 01:11:58,000
I got him back on Tibbetts.

1001
01:12:00,201 --> 01:12:03,173
Fucking guy ran 100 yards
with a bullet in his heart, Dougy.

1002
01:12:03,337 --> 01:12:07,478
I mean, the fucking guy should've
ran track. You know what I'm saying?

1003
01:12:11,578 --> 01:12:12,948
I didn't ask you to do that.

1004
01:12:13,114 --> 01:12:15,251
Yeah, well, you didn't have to, Dougy.
Come on.

1005
01:12:15,882 --> 01:12:19,823
They told me Brendan was coming down
here to roll up on you with a Glock 21.

1006
01:12:19,986 --> 01:12:22,958
So I came over here,
and I put him in the fucking ground.

1007
01:12:24,824 --> 01:12:26,525
Did nine years for it.

1008
01:12:28,493 --> 01:12:30,263
Now, you don't gotta thank me...

1009
01:12:30,963 --> 01:12:32,732
...but you're not walking away.

1010
01:12:34,899 --> 01:12:37,771
I'm grateful for everything
you done for me.

1011
01:12:39,037 --> 01:12:42,010
Your family took me in
when my father went away.

1012
01:12:44,842 --> 01:12:46,679
You're like a brother to me.

1013
01:12:48,413 --> 01:12:50,116
But I'm leaving.

1014
01:12:52,917 --> 01:12:54,553
Gonna shoot me?

1015
01:12:55,787 --> 01:12:57,290
Go ahead.

1016
01:12:58,556 --> 01:13:00,993
But you're gonna have to shoot me
in the back.

1017
01:13:13,205 --> 01:13:15,142
- Don't get up.
- All right.

1018
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:17,077
How you doing, Fergie?

1019
01:13:17,242 --> 01:13:21,047
Listen, just wanted to stop by
and tell you myself...

1020
01:13:21,813 --> 01:13:24,552
...whatever this thing is you got
going on...

1021
01:13:24,716 --> 01:13:27,788
...I think my guys can handle it
without me. You know what I mean?

1022
01:13:27,952 --> 01:13:29,955
I wouldn't hire them without you.

1023
01:13:30,121 --> 01:13:32,058
And I wouldn't hire you
without them.

1024
01:13:32,223 --> 01:13:33,458
You're a unit.

1025
01:13:33,623 --> 01:13:37,429
Look, with all due respect,
I didn't come here for a debate.

1026
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,630
I'm not doing it.

1027
01:13:39,895 --> 01:13:43,769
So, you know, work it out
however you can. I...

1028
01:13:43,933 --> 01:13:46,738
Calm down. Okay?

1029
01:13:46,902 --> 01:13:49,808
It goes against
my better judgment...

1030
01:13:50,539 --> 01:13:53,644
...but just out of respect,
smooth things over...

1031
01:13:54,143 --> 01:13:56,447
...just take this for it,
all right?

1032
01:13:57,046 --> 01:13:58,114
Not gonna cut it.

1033
01:13:58,847 --> 01:14:01,852
Do you think I'm gonna put
Joe Flipperhead on this?

1034
01:14:02,351 --> 01:14:04,289
You're gonna do what I ask.

1035
01:14:04,454 --> 01:14:05,656
Not gonna cut it, huh?

1036
01:14:08,257 --> 01:14:09,492
Okay.

1037
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:12,764
Let me ask you something.
Who the fuck do you think you are?

1038
01:14:13,162 --> 01:14:15,266
The only guy in Charlestown
with a gun?

1039
01:14:15,663 --> 01:14:17,601
You guys run numbers and pump dope.

1040
01:14:17,767 --> 01:14:20,839
You're an old guy who don't know
his glory years are behind him.

1041
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:24,042
I ain't fucking working for you.
Got it?

1042
01:14:24,673 --> 01:14:27,413
You got a problem with that,
I live at 551 Bunker Hill Street.

1043
01:14:27,514 --> 01:14:29,114
Stop by anytime.

1044
01:14:29,277 --> 01:14:30,980
You know where to find me.

1045
01:14:31,614 --> 01:14:33,650
You're gonna do this for me...

1046
01:14:33,816 --> 01:14:36,220
...or I'm gonna clip your nuts...

1047
01:14:36,519 --> 01:14:37,989
...like I clipped your daddy's.

1048
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:40,156
Don't talk about my father.

1049
01:14:40,322 --> 01:14:42,859
Son, I knew your daddy.

1050
01:14:43,024 --> 01:14:45,962
He worked for me for years. Years.

1051
01:14:46,494 --> 01:14:48,598
Then he wanted his own thing.

1052
01:14:51,331 --> 01:14:52,399
You play the horses?

1053
01:14:54,168 --> 01:14:58,944
You know, they either geld
a horse with a knife...

1054
01:14:59,106 --> 01:15:01,044
...or with the chemicals.

1055
01:15:01,543 --> 01:15:03,646
When your daddy said no to me...

1056
01:15:04,111 --> 01:15:06,047
...I did him the chemical way.

1057
01:15:06,646 --> 01:15:08,383
Gave your mother a taste.

1058
01:15:08,549 --> 01:15:10,184
Put the hook into her.

1059
01:15:10,584 --> 01:15:12,921
She doped up good and proper.

1060
01:15:13,687 --> 01:15:16,491
Hung herself with a wire
on Melnea Cass.

1061
01:15:17,124 --> 01:15:20,029
And you? Running around
the neighborhood, looking for her.

1062
01:15:20,893 --> 01:15:23,231
Your daddy didn't have the heart
to tell his son...

1063
01:15:23,398 --> 01:15:26,604
...that he was looking for a suicide
doper who was never coming home.

1064
01:15:28,002 --> 01:15:31,375
If there's a heaven, son,
she ain't in it.

1065
01:15:36,711 --> 01:15:37,778
Oh.

1066
01:15:39,913 --> 01:15:42,351
I hear you got a nice,
sweet new girlfriend.

1067
01:15:42,517 --> 01:15:44,053
Lives on the park.

1068
01:15:44,852 --> 01:15:47,924
I don't want to send her
funeral arrangement to your house...

1069
01:15:48,822 --> 01:15:50,659
...but I will if I have to.

1070
01:15:51,658 --> 01:15:53,695
Now I know where to find you.

1071
01:15:55,495 --> 01:15:56,931
Claire.

1072
01:15:57,930 --> 01:15:59,565
Claire?

1073
01:16:11,244 --> 01:16:12,447
- Hey.
- Get out.

1074
01:16:12,613 --> 01:16:13,814
You okay?

1075
01:16:14,547 --> 01:16:16,984
- Get out.
- Hold on one second.

1076
01:16:17,149 --> 01:16:18,651
I have this on 911.

1077
01:16:18,817 --> 01:16:21,989
All right, you need to give me a chance
to explain myself first. Okay?

1078
01:16:22,154 --> 01:16:23,222
No. You had a chance.

1079
01:16:24,557 --> 01:16:26,093
Who talked to you?

1080
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:29,830
The FBI, Doug.

1081
01:16:32,063 --> 01:16:33,966
You have to listen to me.

1082
01:16:34,132 --> 01:16:36,670
You have to let me explain this.
You understand?

1083
01:16:36,835 --> 01:16:38,220
There's a lot going on here,
Claire...

1084
01:16:38,225 --> 01:16:40,043
No, you go to fucking hell!

1085
01:16:40,773 --> 01:16:42,642
- Fucking hell.
- All right, all right.

1086
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:44,310
All right. All right.

1087
01:16:44,477 --> 01:16:46,113
Easy, now.

1088
01:16:47,346 --> 01:16:49,248
Why did you do this to me?

1089
01:16:49,414 --> 01:16:52,219
Claire, I'm sorry. Okay?

1090
01:16:52,385 --> 01:16:53,365
I was gonna tell you.

1091
01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:55,257
I came over here that night
to tell you.

1092
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:59,094
What, the night you fucked me?
Is that your thing?

1093
01:16:59,257 --> 01:17:03,798
It's not enough to terrorize someone,
you have to fuck them too?

1094
01:17:03,962 --> 01:17:08,803
- Listen to me. Calm down, okay?
- No. No. Get out. Get out!

1095
01:17:10,301 --> 01:17:15,209
You don't ever let me see you again.
Never, never.

1096
01:18:16,765 --> 01:18:18,200
All right.

1097
01:18:19,668 --> 01:18:20,903
I'm in.

1098
01:18:22,103 --> 01:18:24,340
But if anything happens to her...

1099
01:18:24,505 --> 01:18:26,742
...if I think anything
might happen to her...

1100
01:18:27,575 --> 01:18:28,777
...I'm coming back here.

1101
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:32,848
And I'm gonna kill both of you
in your own shop.

1102
01:18:49,096 --> 01:18:50,832
Hey, Claire?

1103
01:18:52,433 --> 01:18:55,906
I just wanna talk to you,
just for two minutes. Okay?

1104
01:18:56,637 --> 01:18:58,207
Come on.

1105
01:18:59,675 --> 01:19:01,144
Claire, I would never hurt you.

1106
01:19:01,309 --> 01:19:03,747
I don't know what you would...
Don't fucking touch me.

1107
01:19:03,911 --> 01:19:05,079
All right.

1108
01:19:05,479 --> 01:19:06,815
I'm sorry.

1109
01:19:07,315 --> 01:19:09,785
Just listen to me for a second,
all right?

1110
01:19:09,949 --> 01:19:11,452
I will never lie to you again.

1111
01:19:11,619 --> 01:19:13,789
- Really?
- Yes, I promise you.

1112
01:19:14,288 --> 01:19:16,625
Ask me anything you want.
I'll tell you the truth.

1113
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:18,694
- Why? I won't believe you.
- Yes, you will.

1114
01:19:18,858 --> 01:19:19,893
Why?

1115
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:22,330
Because you'll fucking hate
the answers.

1116
01:19:27,032 --> 01:19:29,703
- You knew I was the manager
in the bank? - Yup.

1117
01:19:29,868 --> 01:19:32,239
- Were you following me?
- Yes.

1118
01:19:32,604 --> 01:19:34,174
How many banks have you robbed?

1119
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:36,575
Six trucks, two banks.

1120
01:19:37,008 --> 01:19:38,578
Have you ever killed anyone?

1121
01:19:38,744 --> 01:19:40,280
No.

1122
01:19:41,414 --> 01:19:42,716
Think about it.

1123
01:19:43,414 --> 01:19:44,750
All right?

1124
01:19:44,916 --> 01:19:47,353
I will never lie to you,
I will never hurt you...

1125
01:19:47,518 --> 01:19:52,794
...and if I lose you, I will
regret that for the rest of my life.

1126
01:19:55,694 --> 01:19:58,599
Just wait for me.

1127
01:20:10,609 --> 01:20:14,049
You know, it's funny. I can see
your daddies' faces in you.

1128
01:20:14,213 --> 01:20:15,281
All of youse.

1129
01:20:15,447 --> 01:20:17,184
Reminds me I'm still in the ring.

1130
01:20:17,549 --> 01:20:21,790
Still taking the punches.
Still ahead on points.

1131
01:20:22,153 --> 01:20:24,925
Now, I have a fellow
on the inside there.

1132
01:20:25,089 --> 01:20:28,864
He likes to play the ponies.
Has a gambling sickness.

1133
01:20:29,027 --> 01:20:31,664
He couldn't pick a horse
to save his fucking life.

1134
01:20:32,231 --> 01:20:34,501
But courtesy of this sick man...

1135
01:20:35,466 --> 01:20:38,171
...I have this. Hm?

1136
01:20:40,036 --> 01:20:42,841
Well, the gang's all here.

1137
01:20:45,142 --> 01:20:46,912
There's always a weak spot.

1138
01:20:47,077 --> 01:20:49,047
We just need to find it.

1139
01:20:52,617 --> 01:20:54,540
The cash is brought out
and stacked...

1140
01:20:54,545 --> 01:20:56,591
...15 minutes
before the van does the pickup.

1141
01:20:57,854 --> 01:20:59,958
That is when you hit.

1142
01:21:00,357 --> 01:21:03,128
And Monday morning, after
a four-game stand with New York...

1143
01:21:03,293 --> 01:21:08,202
...60,000 beers, food,
merchandise, total haul:

1144
01:21:08,365 --> 01:21:09,868
Three and a half million.

1145
01:21:13,938 --> 01:21:18,247
Taking down the cathedral of Boston.

1146
01:21:18,476 --> 01:21:19,611
Priceless.

1147
01:21:34,558 --> 01:21:36,025
How long you think
it's gonna take Rusty

1148
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:37,631
to dump the inside man...

1149
01:21:37,794 --> 01:21:38,997
...when this thing's over?

1150
01:21:39,162 --> 01:21:41,799
Well, he should have picked
better horses.

1151
01:21:45,167 --> 01:21:47,905
This is gonna be a motherfucker.
You know that, right?

1152
01:21:48,938 --> 01:21:52,979
Well, if they were easy, kid,
everybody would do them.

1153
01:21:57,479 --> 01:22:00,853
Lined into right field. A base hit.
Youkilis is headed for third base.

1154
01:22:01,015 --> 01:22:03,753
Hey, Bobby. Yeah, three Buds.

1155
01:22:12,059 --> 01:22:15,032
Seem to be having a bit
of a staring contest over there.

1156
01:22:15,196 --> 01:22:16,364
What can I say?

1157
01:22:16,966 --> 01:22:18,535
Boys like me.

1158
01:22:20,002 --> 01:22:21,337
I bet they do.

1159
01:22:23,171 --> 01:22:25,073
What are you doing down here?

1160
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:26,942
Slumming?

1161
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:30,346
I work for the FBI.

1162
01:22:31,312 --> 01:22:33,049
Me too.

1163
01:22:34,415 --> 01:22:35,885
Well, you must be new.

1164
01:22:39,186 --> 01:22:40,688
You're all right.

1165
01:22:41,589 --> 01:22:44,026
It doesn't mean
you're getting fucked, though.

1166
01:22:44,559 --> 01:22:48,032
You gotta chase the rabbit
if you want the tail.

1167
01:22:49,664 --> 01:22:50,966
My mom taught me that.

1168
01:22:55,636 --> 01:22:58,340
You used to hang around
with Doug MacRay a little bit, huh?

1169
01:22:59,505 --> 01:23:00,874
How do you know Dougy?

1170
01:23:01,041 --> 01:23:02,777
We sort of work together.

1171
01:23:03,175 --> 01:23:04,477
Sand and Gravel?

1172
01:23:05,111 --> 01:23:06,847
No. No, no.

1173
01:23:14,185 --> 01:23:16,556
You a pretty decent judge of size?

1174
01:23:17,122 --> 01:23:18,390
Depends.

1175
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:20,559
Size of what?

1176
01:23:21,894 --> 01:23:23,430
How big would you say that is?

1177
01:23:24,297 --> 01:23:25,499
Six inches?

1178
01:23:26,098 --> 01:23:27,567
Over or under?

1179
01:23:27,934 --> 01:23:28,969
Under.

1180
01:23:29,134 --> 01:23:30,303
Wrong.

1181
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:33,107
6.14 inches exactly.

1182
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:36,877
I know everything there is to know
about money.

1183
01:23:37,108 --> 01:23:39,948
Thickness: .0043 inches.

1184
01:23:40,746 --> 01:23:44,687
Weight: about one gram.

1185
01:23:45,384 --> 01:23:47,321
Which is interesting...

1186
01:23:47,386 --> 01:23:48,715
...because that means
that this $20 bill...

1187
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:51,293
...isn't even worth
its own weight...

1188
01:23:51,457 --> 01:23:53,394
...in Oxy.

1189
01:23:59,130 --> 01:24:00,599
So how does it work?

1190
01:24:01,801 --> 01:24:03,603
Bartender gets a call...

1191
01:24:04,703 --> 01:24:07,707
...you pick up a package at point A,
deliver it to point B...

1192
01:24:07,871 --> 01:24:10,409
...the Florist gives you C?

1193
01:24:14,210 --> 01:24:16,047
You're thinking of running out on me.

1194
01:24:17,748 --> 01:24:20,821
It's not that simple.
Because, you see...

1195
01:24:21,886 --> 01:24:23,721
...I start waving this around
in here...

1196
01:24:28,458 --> 01:24:29,827
...bad for you.

1197
01:24:34,197 --> 01:24:35,800
I want a lawyer.

1198
01:24:36,133 --> 01:24:38,070
Good. Get one.

1199
01:24:39,003 --> 01:24:41,574
I mean, it's all about protecting
yourself, right?

1200
01:24:41,872 --> 01:24:45,144
Not even yourself. Your daughter.

1201
01:24:45,308 --> 01:24:47,846
Don't talk about my daughter.

1202
01:24:50,115 --> 01:24:52,486
How long were you with MacRay?

1203
01:24:53,584 --> 01:24:54,886
All my life.

1204
01:24:56,185 --> 01:24:58,756
In all those years
that you were together...

1205
01:25:00,657 --> 01:25:03,897
...how many diamond necklaces
did he give you?

1206
01:25:06,729 --> 01:25:08,499
All right, the tools are set.

1207
01:25:08,665 --> 01:25:10,835
Got our body armor.

1208
01:25:14,236 --> 01:25:16,072
You know, this thing goes right...

1209
01:25:16,471 --> 01:25:18,875
...could be your turn
to step away too.

1210
01:25:19,041 --> 01:25:22,013
Yeah. Sure.

1211
01:25:22,243 --> 01:25:23,813
What am I gonna do, Dougy, huh?

1212
01:25:23,979 --> 01:25:25,405
Go down to Margaritaville,

1213
01:25:25,410 --> 01:25:28,488
drink me half a yard
and fall off fucking bar stools?

1214
01:25:29,017 --> 01:25:30,553
Do me a favor.

1215
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,923
The weight of this thing...

1216
01:25:33,555 --> 01:25:35,659
...pack a parachute at least.

1217
01:25:36,124 --> 01:25:38,829
You know the funniest thing
about being in prison?

1218
01:25:40,862 --> 01:25:43,166
Guys pretending
that they wanna get out.

1219
01:25:45,168 --> 01:25:47,372
I can't do any more time, Dougy.

1220
01:25:50,139 --> 01:25:51,774
So if we get jammed up...

1221
01:25:52,407 --> 01:25:54,344
...we're holding court on the street.

1222
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:14,564
Fuck are you doing here, Kris?

1223
01:26:15,198 --> 01:26:16,466
I need to talk to you.

1224
01:26:16,631 --> 01:26:18,266
Not a great time, hon.

1225
01:26:18,433 --> 01:26:19,635
- I know.
- You know?

1226
01:26:19,801 --> 01:26:21,771
Okay. Well, what do you want?

1227
01:26:21,937 --> 01:26:23,239
Here you go.

1228
01:26:23,705 --> 01:26:25,473
Dez told me you were here.

1229
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:28,709
I wanna see you before you go.

1230
01:26:28,876 --> 01:26:32,215
Kris, you could do 30 years
for walking in the door.

1231
01:26:32,378 --> 01:26:34,515
Okay? Do you understand that?
For being here.

1232
01:26:34,681 --> 01:26:37,753
You can't be bringing your kid
in here, you got it? You can't stay.

1233
01:26:37,917 --> 01:26:40,490
I don't wanna stay,
I wanna go with you.

1234
01:26:40,921 --> 01:26:42,758
- I wanna change too, Dougy.
- Christ.

1235
01:26:42,923 --> 01:26:45,827
Why the fuck can't I change?
I could be a different person.

1236
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:47,327
Jesus Christ.

1237
01:26:47,493 --> 01:26:50,765
You tell me what you want me to do.
I'll be whoever you want me to be.

1238
01:26:52,132 --> 01:26:54,136
I'm leaving with somebody else.

1239
01:26:58,304 --> 01:26:59,606
Oh, yeah?

1240
01:27:00,206 --> 01:27:01,442
Yeah.

1241
01:27:03,308 --> 01:27:05,211
Why isn't she here then?

1242
01:27:06,445 --> 01:27:08,316
Come on.
What do you want me to tell you?

1243
01:27:08,481 --> 01:27:11,053
She's going away with you,
why isn't she here?

1244
01:27:11,218 --> 01:27:13,155
Where is she? She's not here.

1245
01:27:14,721 --> 01:27:16,958
- Such a trashy little fuck pad.
- Take it easy.

1246
01:27:17,124 --> 01:27:20,261
After a Tiffany necklace,
I thought a room at the Ritz.

1247
01:27:20,659 --> 01:27:22,195
Huh?

1248
01:27:23,362 --> 01:27:24,732
What'd you say?

1249
01:27:25,932 --> 01:27:28,737
Where did you hear that?
Where'd you hear about a necklace?

1250
01:27:29,169 --> 01:27:30,738
A little bird.

1251
01:27:33,106 --> 01:27:35,943
Fucking smartass. Who told you that?
Who told you about a necklace?

1252
01:27:37,408 --> 01:27:40,480
I know you'd rather see a rope
around my neck!

1253
01:27:42,146 --> 01:27:44,383
You're getting the fuck out of here.
Let's go.

1254
01:27:44,549 --> 01:27:47,553
Come here, honey. I know,
it's gonna be okay. It's all right.

1255
01:27:47,718 --> 01:27:50,123
- We're coming with you.
- You're getting out of here.

1256
01:27:50,289 --> 01:27:52,126
Dougy, we're fucking coming with you.

1257
01:27:52,291 --> 01:27:55,496
It's time to go. Okay? Here we go.

1258
01:27:55,659 --> 01:27:58,931
Time to go, sweetheart. Okay?

1259
01:27:59,095 --> 01:28:00,598
- I'm not leaving here.
- Let's go.

1260
01:28:00,764 --> 01:28:02,868
- I'm not fucking leaving.
- Take the kid home.

1261
01:28:03,033 --> 01:28:04,704
Get the fuck off me!

1262
01:28:04,869 --> 01:28:06,772
I can walk myself.

1263
01:28:07,271 --> 01:28:09,375
Don't you say no to me!

1264
01:28:12,642 --> 01:28:14,045
Take this.

1265
01:28:21,485 --> 01:28:22,653
Hey.

1266
01:28:23,254 --> 01:28:26,594
Will you quit fucking doing that?
You're making me nervous.

1267
01:28:41,172 --> 01:28:44,478
Yeah, we got a DWI over here,
one car.

1268
01:28:44,641 --> 01:28:48,079
Coughlin, Kristina.
She had a kid with her.

1269
01:28:48,744 --> 01:28:51,315
The mother's at Mass General.
She wanted me to call you.

1270
01:28:51,479 --> 01:28:54,117
All right, yeah.
I'll be right there.

1271
01:29:22,411 --> 01:29:23,613
Officer.

1272
01:29:24,612 --> 01:29:26,147
Yeah. Let's go.

1273
01:29:33,454 --> 01:29:34,790
Down here.

1274
01:30:28,174 --> 01:30:29,844
There's the door.

1275
01:30:30,410 --> 01:30:33,047
And remember,
you never fucking saw me.

1276
01:30:33,312 --> 01:30:34,480
Okay.

1277
01:30:49,429 --> 01:30:52,168
Dr. Forrest, dial 992, please.

1278
01:30:52,332 --> 01:30:55,304
Dr. Forrest, please dial 992.

1279
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:03,146
Here he is, Mr. Six-Inches.

1280
01:31:04,977 --> 01:31:06,011
What happened?

1281
01:31:06,178 --> 01:31:09,584
You're a crimestopper,
figure it the fuck out.

1282
01:31:11,649 --> 01:31:12,884
Sweetheart.

1283
01:31:13,952 --> 01:31:17,525
I know you have OxyCodone,
cocaine and alcohol in your system.

1284
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:21,295
I know that you have five cars
registered in your name.

1285
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:23,025
And I know right now,

1286
01:31:23,030 --> 01:31:24,967
your daughter is sitting
in the back of a state van...

1287
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:27,400
...being driven to
the Department of Social Services.

1288
01:31:27,564 --> 01:31:29,167
So how long you wanna do this?

1289
01:31:29,334 --> 01:31:30,502
I'm a person, you know?

1290
01:31:30,667 --> 01:31:32,837
A person
who's gonna need a plea agreement...

1291
01:31:33,003 --> 01:31:35,141
...if you ever want to see
your kid again.

1292
01:31:38,777 --> 01:31:41,782
Why is it always I'm the one
who's getting used?

1293
01:31:42,713 --> 01:31:44,049
What do you have?

1294
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:51,758
Knowing just that...

1295
01:31:53,191 --> 01:31:54,928
...Dougy's going away after.

1296
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:58,932
Wait, what after? After what?

1297
01:32:01,131 --> 01:32:04,671
Krista, I need you to be smart here.

1298
01:32:05,103 --> 01:32:08,576
This could be a big moment for Shyne.

1299
01:32:09,773 --> 01:32:11,776
Make a huge difference in her life.

1300
01:32:19,248 --> 01:32:21,085
We can help you, sweetheart.

1301
01:33:15,737 --> 01:33:17,139
- You there?
- I'm here.

1302
01:33:17,305 --> 01:33:20,077
- All set.
- Okay. Go ahead.

1303
01:33:20,809 --> 01:33:22,111
All set.

1304
01:33:30,484 --> 01:33:31,586
Who called 911?

1305
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:34,822
You the guys who called 911?

1306
01:33:34,988 --> 01:33:36,491
No one from here called.

1307
01:33:36,657 --> 01:33:38,326
Nah, we didn't... It wasn't us.

1308
01:33:38,492 --> 01:33:39,695
We got a 911 call.

1309
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:41,295
Robbery, guys. Come on.

1310
01:33:41,462 --> 01:33:42,998
- You said a robbery?
- Yeah.

1311
01:33:43,163 --> 01:33:44,866
A call saying you're being held up.

1312
01:33:45,031 --> 01:33:46,700
- Let me call Mike.
- We just walked past Mike.

1313
01:33:46,866 --> 01:33:47,867
He let us in.

1314
01:33:48,034 --> 01:33:50,939
Hey, look, guys. We got
a distress call. All right?

1315
01:33:51,104 --> 01:33:53,541
- So who made the call?
- Nobody called from here.

1316
01:33:54,408 --> 01:33:57,045
No one called? What are we doing here?

1317
01:33:57,210 --> 01:34:00,382
- Hold on. Where's Mike?
- I just told you where Mike was.

1318
01:34:00,548 --> 01:34:01,650
You boys see all right?

1319
01:34:01,814 --> 01:34:04,051
- Huh? You fucking smartass.
- Listen. Listen.

1320
01:34:04,217 --> 01:34:07,256
For our safety, for everyone's safety,
we need to see your IDs.

1321
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:09,993
Guys, hold up.
We been here all morning. Take it easy.

1322
01:34:10,157 --> 01:34:13,129
My partner asked for your ID.
All right? We don't know you.

1323
01:34:13,294 --> 01:34:15,955
Till we identify all the parties
involved here,

1324
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:16,801
we're gonna need some IDs...

1325
01:34:16,963 --> 01:34:19,099
and we're gonna need to see
everyone on the ground. Right now.

1326
01:34:19,264 --> 01:34:20,500
Whoa, whoa.

1327
01:34:20,667 --> 01:34:22,905
- Get your hand off your weapon.
- Hey, relax.

1328
01:34:29,409 --> 01:34:32,214
- Get on the ground!
- Get on the fucking ground.

1329
01:34:32,579 --> 01:34:33,881
Hands behind your back.

1330
01:34:34,047 --> 01:34:35,215
Face down.

1331
01:34:35,381 --> 01:34:37,784
Behind your back. Come on.

1332
01:34:44,556 --> 01:34:47,627
Get your hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back. Let's go.

1333
01:34:47,792 --> 01:34:49,261
- Take it easy.
- Fuck.

1334
01:34:56,866 --> 01:34:58,101
In the cash room.

1335
01:34:58,269 --> 01:35:01,842
Arnold Washton. You live at
311 Hazer Street in Quincy...

1336
01:35:02,005 --> 01:35:05,212
...with a wife named Linda
and three small dogs.

1337
01:35:05,376 --> 01:35:07,748
Do not make a distress call.

1338
01:35:07,912 --> 01:35:09,982
Also in the cash room:

1339
01:35:10,147 --> 01:35:15,323
Morton Previtt.
You live at 21 Counting Lane, Randolph.

1340
01:35:15,486 --> 01:35:17,791
Wife, also Linda.

1341
01:35:17,955 --> 01:35:21,996
Morton, the Lindas
want you to open this door.

1342
01:35:22,193 --> 01:35:24,831
We have men outside your homes.

1343
01:35:28,932 --> 01:35:31,772
Back up. Back up.

1344
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:54,726
You think
you're gonna get out of here?

1345
01:35:55,058 --> 01:35:56,620
I got friends
that are guards at Walpole.

1346
01:35:56,625 --> 01:35:58,365
They'll make your lives hell.

1347
01:35:58,528 --> 01:36:00,833
Well, don't you worry about it,
old-timer.

1348
01:36:00,997 --> 01:36:02,734
No one's going to prison.

1349
01:36:20,684 --> 01:36:22,153
Ten more.

1350
01:36:22,319 --> 01:36:23,554
Right away.

1351
01:36:37,334 --> 01:36:38,568
Picking up.

1352
01:37:10,632 --> 01:37:13,235
...least from the fan base
when the Red Sox win.

1353
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:17,441
When the Red Sox win in extra innings
and everybody can go home happy...

1354
01:37:17,604 --> 01:37:20,242
...and they're singing "Dirty Water"...

1355
01:37:23,110 --> 01:37:25,080
- How you doing?
- Fucking beautiful.

1356
01:37:27,548 --> 01:37:28,883
Come on.

1357
01:37:37,591 --> 01:37:41,433
Last motherfucker who robbed
the Red Sox like this was Jack Clark.

1358
01:38:30,909 --> 01:38:31,930
Looked around the block.

1359
01:38:31,935 --> 01:38:34,183
There's no cars,
no vans around. Nothing.

1360
01:38:34,379 --> 01:38:36,516
Maybe we're too early.
Or too late.

1361
01:38:36,682 --> 01:38:38,525
Guys, let's go.
I want this street clear.

1362
01:38:38,530 --> 01:38:40,791
Come on, get these people
out of here. Let's go.

1363
01:38:40,853 --> 01:38:43,745
Sir! We've been trying to hail security
for the cash room.

1364
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:46,064
We're not getting a response.

1365
01:38:48,294 --> 01:38:50,331
Okay, let's go.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1366
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,931
Come on.

1367
01:38:56,034 --> 01:38:57,302
Come on.

1368
01:39:01,605 --> 01:39:02,808
Shit.

1369
01:39:23,259 --> 01:39:26,264
- Fuck!
- Let's get the fuck out of here!

1370
01:39:31,668 --> 01:39:33,604
That's us inside.

1371
01:39:35,738 --> 01:39:36,940
Go! Go!

1372
01:39:41,276 --> 01:39:43,680
Fuckers!

1373
01:39:58,862 --> 01:40:00,932
Gloans! Gloans. Fuck.

1374
01:40:03,399 --> 01:40:07,039
- He all right? - He's all right.
They just got the vest.

1375
01:40:16,177 --> 01:40:17,747
Yo, Dez, get the plunger!

1376
01:40:37,130 --> 01:40:38,967
Shut it!

1377
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:01,990
Dez?

1378
01:41:03,591 --> 01:41:05,094
Come on, come on.

1379
01:41:07,328 --> 01:41:08,831
They look like EMTs.

1380
01:41:08,998 --> 01:41:11,736
I count four. Maybe one down.

1381
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:13,503
Go.

1382
01:41:16,004 --> 01:41:17,607
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1383
01:41:18,039 --> 01:41:20,308
There's a million fucking cops
out there.

1384
01:41:24,211 --> 01:41:25,513
Cover your ears!

1385
01:41:50,137 --> 01:41:51,205
No!

1386
01:41:58,310 --> 01:42:00,580
- All right, go, go, go.
- All right, move it out.

1387
01:42:17,763 --> 01:42:18,966
Fuck you!

1388
01:42:25,370 --> 01:42:27,507
Move down.
Get them the fuck out of here.

1389
01:42:27,674 --> 01:42:29,542
Meet me at the fucking switch!

1390
01:42:33,612 --> 01:42:35,949
They ain't looking for fucking cops.

1391
01:42:36,314 --> 01:42:38,151
I'm gonna roll out the front...

1392
01:42:38,316 --> 01:42:42,189
...the two of youse beat it out
the side in the fucking cop uniforms.

1393
01:42:43,088 --> 01:42:45,091
The whole fucking force
is out there, kid.

1394
01:42:45,256 --> 01:42:47,492
You know I can take a pinch.

1395
01:42:47,825 --> 01:42:51,097
Don't worry about it.
I'll only give them your first name.

1396
01:43:22,292 --> 01:43:23,861
Clear.

1397
01:43:28,666 --> 01:43:30,368
Okay, go.

1398
01:43:31,202 --> 01:43:32,704
Move, move.

1399
01:43:39,042 --> 01:43:41,212
Hey, don't move. Don't move.

1400
01:43:42,213 --> 01:43:44,984
- Put your weapons down.
- Fuck you. Boston P.D.

1401
01:43:45,148 --> 01:43:48,187
Look out, coming through.
Stand down. Stand down.

1402
01:43:48,350 --> 01:43:49,653
See you in Florida, kid.

1403
01:43:50,253 --> 01:43:52,323
See you when you get back.

1404
01:43:52,654 --> 01:43:54,157
All right. Go.

1405
01:43:54,323 --> 01:43:57,962
All right, guys, let's back up.
Feds got this.

1406
01:44:00,828 --> 01:44:02,331
Hey. Hey.

1407
01:44:02,497 --> 01:44:04,234
You B.P.D. need to fuck off.

1408
01:44:04,398 --> 01:44:06,702
What are you doing?
It's an FBI crime scene.

1409
01:44:06,868 --> 01:44:08,471
Don't put your hand up to me. Go.

1410
01:44:08,636 --> 01:44:10,339
Jurisdiction, guys. Walk away.

1411
01:44:10,505 --> 01:44:11,674
That's my kill.

1412
01:44:25,419 --> 01:44:27,523
I don't know if we're dealing with...

1413
01:44:27,688 --> 01:44:30,092
...some high level of genius here
with security...

1414
01:44:30,423 --> 01:44:33,295
...but security's saying
they got hit by cops.

1415
01:44:33,795 --> 01:44:35,030
Cops?

1416
01:44:35,196 --> 01:44:38,202
Yeah. Two cops, they said.

1417
01:44:52,512 --> 01:44:53,781
Hold up.

1418
01:44:54,081 --> 01:44:55,149
Where you going?

1419
01:44:56,184 --> 01:44:57,219
Pull up here.

1420
01:45:10,462 --> 01:45:12,566
Officer, can you hold up a minute?

1421
01:45:22,108 --> 01:45:25,646
Visual on Coughlin,
heading south toward Boylston.

1422
01:45:25,810 --> 01:45:27,713
Hotel parking lot on Van Ness.

1423
01:45:27,879 --> 01:45:29,682
He's dressed as B.P.D.

1424
01:45:30,114 --> 01:45:31,249
Copy.

1425
01:45:31,416 --> 01:45:32,951
Officer.

1426
01:45:34,820 --> 01:45:36,355
Coughlin.

1427
01:46:15,127 --> 01:46:16,796
Drop your weapon!

1428
01:46:18,629 --> 01:46:20,232
No!

1429
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:23,970
Move! Move!

1430
01:46:48,759 --> 01:46:51,297
Coughlin, throw down your weapon.

1431
01:46:53,530 --> 01:46:55,332
Fuck you.

1432
01:46:55,832 --> 01:46:57,434
Let me see those hands,
right now.

1433
01:46:57,601 --> 01:46:59,171
Fuck you!

1434
01:47:06,543 --> 01:47:08,280
Move, move.

1435
01:47:09,478 --> 01:47:11,181
You got 30 seconds, asshole.

1436
01:47:39,909 --> 01:47:41,311
Okay.

1437
01:47:41,477 --> 01:47:43,214
I surrender.

1438
01:47:43,510 --> 01:47:44,980
I surrender.

1439
01:48:46,705 --> 01:48:49,310
Rusty, something went wrong.

1440
01:48:49,475 --> 01:48:50,644
Come here.

1441
01:49:01,787 --> 01:49:03,156
Fergie.

1442
01:49:04,190 --> 01:49:05,225
Prick.

1443
01:49:32,717 --> 01:49:34,287
Fergie...

1444
01:49:34,986 --> 01:49:37,324
...remember who clipped your nuts
for you.

1445
01:49:38,657 --> 01:49:42,698
I came in hot, saw the suspect run
across the street with a Tec-9.

1446
01:49:42,861 --> 01:49:45,200
I lit up the tires,
I jumped out of the cruiser,

1447
01:49:45,205 --> 01:49:47,536
engaged the suspect in gunfire.

1448
01:49:48,566 --> 01:49:49,567
So that's when...

1449
01:49:49,733 --> 01:49:51,502
- ...you get out of your cruiser.
- Yeah.

1450
01:49:51,668 --> 01:49:55,275
At that point, I fired, struck
the suspect at least once or twice.

1451
01:49:55,439 --> 01:49:56,574
Hey.

1452
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:58,443
Multiple victims down.

1453
01:49:58,609 --> 01:50:00,413
Location, 529 Main Street, Charlestown.

1454
01:50:00,579 --> 01:50:03,050
- Uniformed officers on the scene.
- That's the Florist.

1455
01:50:03,214 --> 01:50:04,749
Hey, Bobby, Bobby, what happened?

1456
01:50:04,914 --> 01:50:06,516
Somebody got Fergie.

1457
01:50:08,251 --> 01:50:10,288
- Jesus Christ, that's gotta be MacRay.
- Fuck.

1458
01:50:17,161 --> 01:50:19,565
Claire, it's me.

1459
01:50:19,829 --> 01:50:20,864
Are you okay?

1460
01:50:21,865 --> 01:50:22,900
I'll be fine. I know.

1461
01:50:23,066 --> 01:50:25,504
But I'm okay. I'm all right.

1462
01:50:25,668 --> 01:50:27,437
Claire, I wanna meet you.

1463
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:32,378
It's gotta be soon.
I don't have a lot of time.

1464
01:50:33,911 --> 01:50:35,380
Can you meet me?

1465
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:37,582
Claire, please.

1466
01:50:38,382 --> 01:50:40,818
I need to know. I gotta go.

1467
01:50:41,850 --> 01:50:43,554
Can you come here?

1468
01:50:49,593 --> 01:50:51,629
You want me
to come where you are now?

1469
01:50:51,961 --> 01:50:53,163
Mm-hm.

1470
01:50:57,100 --> 01:50:59,571
I don't think
that's a good idea for me.

1471
01:51:03,373 --> 01:51:04,608
Why?

1472
01:51:09,912 --> 01:51:11,716
What if there are police there?

1473
01:51:13,782 --> 01:51:15,351
There's no one here.

1474
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:24,028
All right, well, if you think I should
probably come by there...

1475
01:51:24,193 --> 01:51:26,598
...then I guess that's what I'll do.
Yeah.

1476
01:51:28,130 --> 01:51:29,298
Okay.

1477
01:51:30,766 --> 01:51:33,570
Claire, listen, I'm...
Listen. Listen to me.

1478
01:51:35,736 --> 01:51:37,239
I'm sorry, okay?

1479
01:51:38,675 --> 01:51:40,879
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

1480
01:51:42,278 --> 01:51:43,613
Remember that.

1481
01:51:44,347 --> 01:51:47,285
Come down in the back
and let me in in about an hour.

1482
01:51:50,151 --> 01:51:51,587
All right?

1483
01:51:53,488 --> 01:51:55,091
I'll see you.

1484
01:51:56,525 --> 01:51:58,295
Wait, Doug? Doug?

1485
01:51:59,428 --> 01:52:00,897
- Yeah.
- I want you to come.

1486
01:52:01,063 --> 01:52:03,967
I really wanna see you.

1487
01:52:08,703 --> 01:52:11,675
It'll be just like one of my
sunny days.

1488
01:52:23,949 --> 01:52:25,151
Well...

1489
01:52:27,354 --> 01:52:29,023
...I'm on my way then.

1490
01:52:31,824 --> 01:52:32,859
Bye.

1491
01:52:36,529 --> 01:52:38,432
Goodbye, Claire.

1492
01:52:44,571 --> 01:52:46,775
All right,
I'd say we've done our part here.

1493
01:52:46,939 --> 01:52:49,578
You know what? Not now.

1494
01:52:55,548 --> 01:52:58,353
He says he's coming, I want people
at Logan, South Station...

1495
01:52:58,518 --> 01:53:00,922
...downtown, Greyhound,
subway, everything. Now.

1496
01:53:01,086 --> 01:53:03,324
- The city's covered.
- Good.

1497
01:53:26,110 --> 01:53:28,848
We're secure, and everything's ready.

1498
01:53:35,118 --> 01:53:36,915
Sir, we need you
to stay off the street.

1499
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:39,060
Just going to work.
No problem.

1500
01:53:55,272 --> 01:53:57,009
- How long?
- Forty minutes.

1501
01:53:57,507 --> 01:53:59,378
- Alleyway clear?
- Yes, sir.

1502
01:54:27,236 --> 01:54:30,342
We got nothing.
Still no movement in the alley. Over.

1503
01:54:49,990 --> 01:54:51,560
"My sunny days."

1504
01:54:59,167 --> 01:55:01,939
You know, Claire,
we are a national organization.

1505
01:55:10,011 --> 01:55:13,083
All right, boys, let's pack it up.
He ain't coming.

1506
01:55:13,249 --> 01:55:15,720
Let's get the description out.
Let's go.

1507
01:55:15,984 --> 01:55:17,787
We know what he looks like.

1508
01:55:18,853 --> 01:55:20,188
Let's go find him.

1509
01:55:23,826 --> 01:55:24,928
All right. You good?

1510
01:55:25,093 --> 01:55:26,896
Hey, best possible outcome,
you know.

1511
01:55:27,061 --> 01:55:28,998
Well done, well done.

1512
01:55:41,675 --> 01:55:46,016
All aboard.
Amtrak number 93. All points south.

1513
01:56:06,901 --> 01:56:08,370
It's for you.

1514
01:57:13,564 --> 01:57:17,004
Claire, take this.

1515
01:57:17,302 --> 01:57:19,939
You'll do better with it than I can.

1516
01:57:20,539 --> 01:57:23,143
By the time you read this,
I'll be long gone.

1517
01:57:23,307 --> 01:57:24,576
Not the way I planned it...

1518
01:57:25,075 --> 01:57:29,150
...but for the first time in my life,
I'm leaving this city.

1519
01:57:41,725 --> 01:57:42,761
Maybe if I go...

1520
01:57:43,862 --> 01:57:45,498
...I can stop looking.

1521
01:58:07,517 --> 01:58:09,219
No matter how much you change...

1522
01:58:09,384 --> 01:58:12,290
...you still have to pay the price
for the things you've done.

1523
01:58:15,490 --> 01:58:17,327
So I got a long road.

1524
01:58:22,965 --> 01:58:25,303
But I know I'll see you again.

1525
01:58:31,139 --> 01:58:33,142
This side or the other.
