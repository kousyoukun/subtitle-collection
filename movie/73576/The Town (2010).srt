1
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,103
<i>Driver's name is Arthur Shea.</i>

2
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:54,977
<i>Former Medford police officer,
57 years old.</i>

3
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,446
<i>Soon as his partner leaves with
the coal bag...</i>

4
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,984
<i>...Artie cracks The Herald,
and he don't look up till the guy gets back.</i>

5
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,988
<i>Marty MacGuire,
Cummins Armored courier.</i>

6
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,890
<i>5'10", 220, 52 years old.</i>

7
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:13,055
<i>Picks up every Wednesday and Friday
at exactly 8:12.</i>

8
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,896
<i>Makes $110 a day. Carries a SIG 9.</i>

9
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,330
<i>And he's about to get robbed.</i>

10
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,202
We're fucked if we see a helicopter,
we're fucked if we see SWAT.

11
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:27,904
We see a cruiser, stop, take out
the engine blocks, keep moving.

12
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,309
No one needs to get hurt.

13
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,450
Now, these guards
like to test you, though.

14
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:34,553
They want to get hurt for $10 an hour,
don't get in the way.

15
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:37,947
Let's go.

16
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,171
Move!

17
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,213
All right, now get away
from the counter!

18
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,215
Go! Go! Go! Everybody away!

19
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,648
Back against the wall.

20
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,522
You! Away from the computer!

21
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,591
- Give me the fucking key!
- Back up! Back! Go! Go!

22
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,126
- Get up! Get up!
- Get the fucking door!

23
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,320
Get on the ground!

24
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,295
- Get down on the ground.
- Get your fucking ass on the ground!

25
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:21,956
Move! Go, go, go, go!

26
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,229
- On the floor!
- I need everybody's BlackBerrys.

27
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,807
- Everybody on the floor.
- Slide your BlackBerrys up.

28
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,409
Take off your fucking shoes!

29
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,843
BlackBerrys to the front!
Slide your fucking phones up.

30
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,278
- The fuck you looking at?
- Take your shoes off.

31
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,479
Get the cash drawers. Let's go.

32
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:43,486
- Take off your fucking shoes!
- Take off your shoes.

33
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,556
Bank manager, let's go.
Get up. Let's go.

34
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,522
Get up, come on, get up. Let's go.

35
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:51,027
Not you. You. Get up. Let's go.
Come on.

36
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,723
- You trying to be a hero?
- Jesus Christ!

37
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,028
- When's the time lock set for?
- 9:00.

38
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,898
Don't lie to us, it's 8:15.

39
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,200
Listen, it's not your money.
You understand? Don't lie to us again.

40
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,708
Hey, sweetheart, in the corner.
Get in the corner. You too, brother-man.

41
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:20,518
Go. Go.

42
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,122
No distress call. Open it clean.

43
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,469
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Don't stall.

44
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,105
This guy a fucking friend of yours?

45
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,836
Let's go!

46
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,538
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

47
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,043
Take your time, okay?

48
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,711
Breathe. Go.

49
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,838
Okay, get back. Get out of the way.

50
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,664
Front door.

51
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,639
- Hello.
- Front door.

52
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,535
Hey, you guys open?

53
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:05,621
We gotta go.

54
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:09,195
Let's go. Let's bleach it up.

55
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,929
- Go, go, go.
- Let's bleach it up.

56
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:16,536
- Come on, let's go. We gotta go.
- Hold it. Silent alarm, this address.

57
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,644
- Who did it?
- Look, nobody did anything.

58
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:23,315
- What? Huh? What'd you say?
- Nobody did anything.

59
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,708
- You pull the alarm?
- No. No.

60
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,648
- Did you?
- I didn't pull any alarm.

61
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,186
We were leaving,
you motherfucker! You fuck!

62
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,890
Easy, easy. That's enough.

63
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,159
- All right? Easy.
- You fuck!

64
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,800
You fucker. We were out the door,
you fuck.

65
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,230
Let's go.

66
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,080
Where's your purse?

67
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,281
What the fuck is this?

68
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,949
The cops get us walled in,
we're gonna need her.

69
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,027
Sit down. Go.

70
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,104
Head for the boulevard.

71
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,575
You're gonna be okay.

72
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,217
All right? No one's gonna hurt you.

73
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,012
What's up?

74
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:07,778
Boosted a city work van.
Which still hasn't been reported stolen.

75
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,785
Probably too busy working.

76
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,151
Used the van to screen the door.

77
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,418
Bleached the entire place for DNA.

78
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,062
Kills all the clothing fiber,
so we can't get a match.

79
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,698
Silent bell
came from cage number two.

80
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,857
Assistant manager's at Beth Israel.

81
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,696
Our guys waited for the time lock
to expire...

82
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,362
...then they had the manager
open sesame.

83
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,805
Under duress?

84
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,836
I don't know.

85
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:33,871
Ten foot steel safe.

86
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,579
Only as strong
as the guy with the key.

87
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,649
Found the dye packs and the tracers.

88
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,618
Found the van. Torched.

89
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,126
- Where is it?
- Where do you think?

90
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,919
Is that where we are now?

91
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,381
Where's Jem?

92
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,889
Stopped on the way
to light a couple house fires...

93
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,653
...stick up a liquor store, maybe,
I don't know.

94
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,991
- Are we taking hostages now?
- No, we're not taking hostages now.

95
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:29,328
- You gonna talk to this fucking asshole?
- For one thing...

96
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,629
Hey.

97
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,499
Speak of the fucking devil.

98
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,064
You made it.

99
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,043
- Take the scenic route?
- We got a problem.

100
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,236
- What?
- Well, look.

101
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,139
So what?

102
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,046
What's the matter?
Let me see that.

103
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,049
- Fuck.
- Oh, shit.

104
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,780
- See the address on that?
- Bitch lives four blocks away.

105
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,187
Yeah, I know
where we are, Gloans. Fuck.

106
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,554
We gonna see this bitch
on the street every day?

107
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:56,922
She didn't see anything.

108
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,495
Jesus, are you sure?

109
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,757
- Taking her for a ride didn't help.
- Yeah.

110
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,629
Oh, fuck.
All right. I'm gonna handle it.

111
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,100
How you gonna handle this?

112
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,899
I'm gonna stalk her
like a fucking A car, we'll find out.

113
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,065
- Find out what?
- Lf she needs to get scared.

114
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,938
- She's already scared.
- Well, maybe not scared enough.

115
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,946
Thanks, Kathy.

116
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:25,747
Ms. Keesey. Special Agent Adam Frawley,
Violent Crimes and Robbery.

117
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,951
Derek here is gonna take some
elimination prints.

118
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,826
I see you've given
a preliminary statement.

119
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,091
I want to talk to you
about your abduction.

120
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,392
Okay.

121
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,230
- I understand they threatened you.
- Mm-hm.

122
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,002
One of them took my license.

123
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,642
And did you try to escape
at any point?

124
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,669
No.

125
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,372
Is there anything you can identify
about the men? Anything you'd testify to?

126
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,018
I didn't try to escape
because they had guns.

127
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,744
I understand.

128
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,423
Then they just let you go?

129
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,117
- Yeah. They just let me go.
- Thanks.

130
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,691
Should I have a lawyer here?

131
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,900
This isn't a very civil libertarian thing of me
to say, but anyone who lawyers up is guilty.

132
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,164
- I think you're all right.
- Okay.

133
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:20,236
When someone endures
an experience like this...

134
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,177
...there are very often
residual effects.

135
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,646
It's gonna be okay.

136
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,349
Did they say anything?

137
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:33,015
"If you talk to the FBI, we'll come
to your house and fuck you and kill you."

138
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,784
Are you gonna take care of it?

139
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,027
- I'll do it.
- Why are you gonna do it?

140
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,188
You're the reason
we're having conversation.

141
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,994
- I'm gonna get it done.
- What are you gonna get done? Huh?

142
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,428
You get picked up
for intimidating a witness.

143
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:48,129
You walk within 100 feet of her,
that's 10 years. Okay?

144
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:52,334
You got two strikes against you already.
They're gonna bury you under the jail.

145
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,607
How much money's in the sack?

146
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,578
All right, we got 90 a pop.

147
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,014
Minus what I had to shave off
for the Florist.

148
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,654
Hey, Jem, what happened
with the assistant manager?

149
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,653
Yeah. Well, next time Skeletor comes
in the bank with an AK...

150
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:10,023
...I think he's gonna think twice
about hitting that alarm, isn't he?

151
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,255
He's lucky he just got tuned up.

152
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:21,497
- Hey, Rusty. How you doing?
- Hey, Jem. What's up? How are you?

153
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,335
Fergie. Kid's here.

154
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,204
Hey, Fergie.

155
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,540
- Here you go.
- How's it going, son?

156
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:34,083
All right. You run that under the sink,
all right?

157
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,344
Trust me.

158
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,225
All right. Good to see you.

159
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,626
Take it easy, man. Good to see you.

160
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,930
<i>Where are they?
What are they doing right now?</i>

161
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:56,473
They got the money,
now they have to clean it. Casinos. Tracks.

162
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:59,202
<i>Maybe they make a big drug buy,
flip it across town.</i>

163
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:00,902
<i>They want to go celebrate, right?</i>

164
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,914
B.P.D., DEA, I want tips,
names, witnesses, anything.

165
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,110
We're gonna knock on some doors,
see who wants to help us out.

166
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,313
Any questions? No? Great. Let's go.

167
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,892
What's going on, pal?

168
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,156
What up?

169
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,663
Hey, there he is.

170
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,028
- Boom.
- Sober Jackson.

171
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,170
- What's up?
- Hey, hey. Krista's here.

172
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:27,870
Go on, tell the story.

173
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,476
Dougy, sit down. I'm trying to tell
these motherfuckers about your father.

174
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,477
The feds will never understand
the guy who's facing 40 years.

175
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,139
Gonna give him the opportunity
to walk scot-free if he gives up his friends.

176
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,376
He tells them,
"Suck a dick. Give me the 40."

177
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,645
"Fucking suck a dick."

178
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,853
Yeah, well, here's to Big Mac.

179
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,021
Doing his time like a man.

180
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,162
- That's right.
- Last crew in Charlestown.

181
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,796
I'm gonna get a tonic, I guess.

182
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,932
All right.
Get me an umbrella for my beer.

183
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:57,557
Let me get a Shirley Temple
with an extra cherry, please.

184
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,901
Poor fucking sober bastard.

185
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,841
- Thanks.
- No problem.

186
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,382
Juice?

187
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,782
Yeah. Juice.

188
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,256
Do you want some snappers
to go with that?

189
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,052
- What are you doing?
- I was just playing.

190
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:22,990
Fuck.

191
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,988
My drink.

192
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,370
Heard you got in a fight, Kris.

193
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,203
Do I look like I got in a fight?

194
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,470
I don't know. Let me see.
They pull your hoop out?

195
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:40,669
That's right.

196
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:43,940
Fucking Somalian started talking shit
when I was with my daughter.

197
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,812
- You were with Shyne?
- All they see are yuppies down here.

198
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,955
They think there's no more serious
white people in Charlestown.

199
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,283
So they can fucking talk shit?

200
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,125
No.

201
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,858
Well, do you miss it?

202
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,692
Fucking coke and Oxy
and all that shit? Yeah, I miss it.

203
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,560
We smoked it to the filter, right?

204
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,202
You know what I miss?

205
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,978
There you go.

206
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,779
There you go.

207
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,383
That's what you want, right?

208
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,620
- Yeah.
- Is that what you want?

209
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,827
- Say you love it.
- Oh, fuck.

210
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,662
Good night.

211
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,688
<i>I'm grateful to be here today.</i>

212
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:10,631
<i>Growing up in Charlestown in,
you know, a small-knit community...</i>

213
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,896
<i>...we took care of each other,
were protected.</i>

214
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,972
<i>My friends were really
like my family.</i>

215
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,574
<i>I'm ashamed of the things I done
when I'm out there.</i>

216
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,676
<i>I don't know
where I learned these things.</i>

217
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,973
<i>Seven years went by,
and I'd watch Christmas, birthdays...</i>

218
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,911
<i>I didn't know what my son looked like.</i>

219
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,075
<i>Make a fast buck if we had to...</i>

220
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:31,586
<i>...that progressed
into getting arrested, and...</i>

221
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:35,454
<i>The struggle that you have within yourself,
the loss, you know what I mean?</i>

222
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:39,688
<i>The disappointment in yourself. The anger
that turns into disappointment. The despair.</i>

223
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,698
It's like the guy sitting in the bar,
and a priest walks in.

224
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:44,392
The guy says, "Hey, wait a minute.

225
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,768
I hate to tell you this, don't waste your
time, but I happen to know there's no God."

226
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,602
The priest says, "Yeah, how's that?"

227
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:54,109
The guy says,
"I was an explorer in the North Pole.

228
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:57,715
I got caught in a blinding storm once.
Freezing. I was blinded.

229
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:01,478
Freezing to death. And I prayed,
'lf there's a God, save me now.'

230
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,143
Now, God didn't come."

231
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:07,019
And the priest says, you know, "How's
that? You're alive. He must've saved you."

232
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,682
He says, "God never showed up.

233
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,888
An Eskimo came along.
Took me back to his camp and saved me."

234
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:16,091
That's Janice. She's my wife
and she's sitting right there.

235
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:19,166
She's my Eskimo.

236
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,413
- How you doing?
- Hey.

237
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,312
Excuse me?

238
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,718
Are you doing laundry?

239
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,359
Huh?

240
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:52,323
I just wondered if you had any change.
The machine is out.

241
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,260
- Can't help you. Sorry.
- Okay.

242
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:00,164
I can just hang them up
when I get home.

243
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,759
You all right?

244
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,602
I'm fine. I'm just...

245
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,400
Are you sure?

246
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:41,836
You okay?

247
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:45,905
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine, thank you.
I'm fine, yeah.

248
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:47,813
Well, this is embarrassing.

249
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,454
No, you got nothing
to be embarrassed for.

250
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,248
Do you need help?

251
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,919
I'm just having a bad week.

252
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,860
I understand.

253
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,431
I like to have a good cry
at the nail salon.

254
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:11,104
Just open right up to the ladies.
They're very understanding.

255
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:14,404
But, you know,
you like the Laundromat, so that's fine.

256
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:24,853
Hey, why don't you let me
buy you a drink.

257
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,491
Make up for letting you down
with the quarters.

258
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,253
You know, see if we can turn
your week around.

259
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,057
What's the worst that could happen?

260
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,529
<i>FBI! Open the door!</i>

261
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,128
Open the door!

262
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,068
Fuck.

263
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,404
Fuck.

264
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,570
Fucking cocksucker. Get off him.

265
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,293
Jesus Christ, Henry.

266
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,157
Oxy, guns?

267
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,558
It's like townie Christmas.

268
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:16,166
Minimum federal sentencing,
10 years.

269
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,206
You're gonna need a friend.

270
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,146
And she ain't it.

271
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,777
Great girl, though.
She really loves you, I can tell.

272
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,918
Good news for you is you have an alibi
for the Cambridge job.

273
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:36,857
The good news for me
is I bet you know something about it.

274
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,326
Everyone does trucks.

275
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,230
These guys beat the alarm
for the vault.

276
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,430
- Yeah?
- It's what I heard.

277
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:49,335
A kid, he gets into the junction box.

278
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,111
- There she is.
- Hey.

279
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:02,776
- All set?
- Yes.

280
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,788
I should have come
get your door for you, huh?

281
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,894
What kind of a guy lets you open
your own door like that?

282
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:14,459
What?

283
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,299
I have to get something out there...

284
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,927
...otherwise I'll be pretending
to listen to you all night...

285
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,597
...when really I'm thinking about
something else.

286
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,034
Okay.

287
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:31,248
A few days ago my bank was robbed.

288
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,943
Four men took it over
and opened the safe.

289
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,380
They took me as a hostage.

290
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,823
They blindfolded me
and drove me around.

291
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,124
And then they stopped and let me out
over at the beach and...

292
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:52,802
And one of the guys told me...

293
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,769
...to walk until I felt the water
on my toes.

294
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:02,044
It was the longest walk of my life.
I kept thinking I'd step off a cliff.

295
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:08,683
And then I felt the water.

296
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,421
I'm sorry.

297
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,353
It's not your fault.

298
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,460
Anyway, the FBI guy told me
it would feel like I was in mourning.

299
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:25,728
FBI? You're working with the FBI?

300
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,337
Mm-hm.

301
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,007
What does that mean?

302
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:33,933
Guy comes by, checks in on you,
gives you a call? That kind of thing?

303
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:35,670
Pretty much.

304
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:40,044
They don't have any suspects?
Any clues? Any leads? Anything like that?

305
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,817
I don't know.
Not that they've told me.

306
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,786
He intimated that they were
scouring Charlestown...

307
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,458
...but they were wearing masks, so...

308
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,462
- Shit.
- Mm.

309
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:58,265
I'm sure I'd recognize their voices
if I heard them again.

310
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,633
I don't know,
might be harder than you think.

311
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,139
So, what do you do for work?

312
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,376
Boston Sand and Gravel.

313
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,541
I break rocks.
Punch a ticket at the end of the day...

314
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,585
...slide down the back of a brontosaurus
like Fred Flintstone.

315
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:17,847
Call it a night.

316
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,091
- Can I ask you something?
- You sure can.

317
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,727
I volunteer at the Boys & Girls Club
in Charlestown...

318
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,055
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

319
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:29,166
As a kickball pitcher since they haven't
been able to afford any ice for the rink.

320
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,996
Embarrassing. City won't put
any money into that place.

321
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,970
Yeah, I know. Yeah, well, some of the kids
were calling me a toonie.

322
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:40,137
It just means a yuppie. Someone who's
not from Charlestown, that's all.

323
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,611
- Of course it does.
- They're just being punks.

324
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,356
- Hey, Jem. How's it going?
- Hey, B. Can I have a beer? Thanks.

325
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:53,616
- Oh, shit.
- What up?

326
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:57,228
- How you doing?
- All right. Sox got rocked.

327
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,457
What's going on?

328
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,995
You, uh, check on that thing?

329
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,264
What?

330
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,567
The license.

331
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:14,576
- Yeah.
- And?

332
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:17,772
Nothing. It's a dead end. We're all set.

333
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,211
So no need to remove her
from the equation?

334
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,789
- What?
- You heard me.

335
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:28,021
What are you, a triggerman now?

336
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,326
Just loose ends, kid.

337
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:35,492
You're gonna get the fucking electric
chair brought back over to Charlestown.

338
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,999
Don't be so goddamned panicked,
all right, Dig Dug?

339
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:41,332
Just, you know, I don't wanna get
backdoored, that's all.

340
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:44,373
- We're fine. All right?
- All right. We're fine.

341
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,841
- Okay.
- We're fine.

342
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,407
They obviously know
how to work the box.

343
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:55,610
But I like the way they zapped the BPT
to the D-5 station.

344
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,914
How does one learn how to do that?

345
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,124
Get a job at Vericom.

346
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,921
- Okay.
- Thank you.

347
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,798
All right, let's subpoena work logs,
employee records.

348
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:09,957
Start with everybody
who lives in the town.

349
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,568
Got it.

350
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,334
<i>I lied to the FBI.</i>

351
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,163
<i>What?</i>

352
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,031
When the guy attacked David...

353
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,769
...I could see the back of his neck
and he had a tattoo.

354
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,308
Of what?

355
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,912
It was one of those
Fighting Irish tattoos.

356
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,611
I'm afraid if I report it
they'll make me testify.

357
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,155
What do you think I should do?

358
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,822
Tell the FBI.

359
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:43,131
If the guy's got a record,
and I'm sure he does...

360
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:45,929
...they'll have his tattoos on file.

361
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:48,398
They'll ring him up the next day.

362
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:51,565
Robbery, weapons. He'll get 30 years.

363
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:55,270
Course, they'll worry someone's
gonna come looking for the witness.

364
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,311
The FBI will probably want to put you in
WITSEC, you know, Witness Security.

365
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:03,545
You know, they'll probably put you
somewhere, like, you know, in Cleveland...

366
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,917
...or Arizona, you know,
somewhere safe.

367
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,592
Or...

368
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:11,725
...you could wait.

369
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:15,666
You have a card.

370
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:18,866
There's nothing says you gotta play it
right away.

371
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:22,131
You're the one who's vulnerable
in this situation right now.

372
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:25,132
The FBI are just people
like anyone else.

373
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,302
They wanna find the bad guy so they
can go home and nuke their supper.

374
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,540
You have to look out
for yourself, Claire.

375
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,145
Quite an expert.

376
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,713
Not really.

377
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:41,555
Just watch a lot of TV.

378
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,428
<i>I watch a lot of CSI.</i>

379
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,588
So I'm a really big expert
on all this. I know.

380
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:51,167
<i>And Miami CSI and New York CSI.</i>

381
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,201
All of them, I watch.

382
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:54,702
You'll be well-prepared.

383
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,272
<i>And Bones.</i>

384
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:05,446
Do we know each other well enough for
me to say that this truck is a little much?

385
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:06,743
It's my work truck.

386
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:10,081
If you have problems with your Prius
I can throw it in the back.

387
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,246
How did you know I had a Prius?

388
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:18,260
Took a guess.
I mean, it just seemed like a toonie car.

389
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,261
- Why, do you really have a Prius?
- Yeah.

390
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,798
- Really?
- I had a Prius.

391
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,959
- It got vandalized, of course.
- What happened?

392
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:29,504
Doesn't matter. Now I'm forced to walk
a mile through the projects.

393
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:33,041
- There were these guys and they started...
- What?

394
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,078
I'm not sure if it was the same guys
who trashed my car, but...

395
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:39,739
They started getting, you know...
It started with yelling when I walked by...

396
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,148
...and then it got
really aggressive and...

397
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,514
What were they doing?

398
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,849
Once glass bottles
started getting thrown...

399
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:49,960
...I started coming to terms with not being
cool enough to walk through the projects.

400
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,925
They threw bottles at you?

401
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:55,692
I'm fine. I just have to, you know,
go the long way.

402
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,035
That's all. It doesn't matter.

403
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,728
No. You just have to live with it,
I guess.

404
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,833
You remember what they look like?

405
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,478
I need your help.
I can't tell you what it is...

406
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:15,176
...you can never ask me about it later,
and we're gonna hurt some people.

407
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:19,222
Whose car are we gonna take?

408
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:28,662
Townie credit card.

409
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,991
- Who is it?
- Open up.

410
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,065
What the...?

411
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:12,741
Oh, shit, that hurts, huh?
Is that your throwing hand?

412
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:16,306
If you're still here in a week,
we're coming back.

413
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:19,307
Let's go, we're done.

414
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:22,478
Hey.

415
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,718
- What'd you do?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

416
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,858
That's my brother.
What'd you do to him?

417
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,857
I don't know what you're talking about.

418
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:32,258
- You don't know? How about now?
- No.

419
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,694
Hey, chill, chill, chill, man. Chill.
Chill, man.

420
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,231
Don't tell me to chill.

421
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,028
- Enough. Let's go.
- What'd you do?

422
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,103
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No?

423
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,370
There goes college soccer.
Hey, look at me.

424
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,776
See my face?

425
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,145
Go tell the cops, all right?

426
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:52,340
But just remember, I seen yours too.

427
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,348
Fuck.

428
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:08,698
I can't be up there
killing people, man.

429
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,326
Hey, you brought me.

430
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:22,803
<i>Desmond Elden?</i>

431
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,882
Yeah, works for Vericom.
Never seen the inside of a jail cell.

432
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,712
Most of these guys got no-show jobs.
Take down a truck...

433
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,414
...foreman goes, "Yeah, guy was here
yesterday." He shows us a forged timecard.

434
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,491
Can't play them games at Vericom
because it's a public company.

435
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,651
You don't show up,
it's a recorded sick day.

436
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:40,457
And Dezzy here,
he's got some interesting sick days.

437
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:46,730
BankBoston, Cummins Armored,
Arlington Brinks, Cambridge Merchants.

438
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,212
Jesus Christ.

439
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:01,308
So do your parents
still live in Charlestown?

440
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:05,855
No, my father finally
made it out to the suburbs.

441
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:07,916
What about your mother?

442
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:11,294
I couldn't tell you.
She left when I was 6.

443
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,022
What happened?

444
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:18,966
She left.

445
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,909
Okay.

446
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:40,588
This sound woke me up.

447
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:45,162
At first I didn't know what it was.

448
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,323
Sounded like an animal
that got trapped.

449
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,567
I never heard a man cry before.

450
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:59,339
I came downstairs in my underwear.

451
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:03,105
I see my father in the kitchen.

452
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:05,845
First thing I remember was the ashtray.

453
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,485
Must have been a hundred cigarettes
in there.

454
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,144
Ash like a little mountain.

455
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,550
He stopped crying...

456
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:18,326
...was just sitting there watching TV
on a little black-and-white.

457
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,157
No sound.

458
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,162
I think he just didn't know
what else to do.

459
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:31,773
He looked at me standing there
in the doorway in my Underoos.

460
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:38,475
He said, "Your mother left.
She's not coming back."

461
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,950
Just like that.

462
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:48,921
Smoking cigarettes and eating
a TV dinner at 6 in the morning.

463
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:55,493
We lost our dog the year before...

464
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,732
...and I wanted to make these posters...

465
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,602
...in case my mother was lost...

466
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,607
...someone could call us...

467
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,440
...like the guy who found our dog.

468
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:15,580
To this day my father will tell you he helped
me make them posters, but he didn't.

469
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:19,621
Sat in the kitchen, drank a case of beer
while I went out on School Street...

470
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:22,521
...asking people
if they'd seen my mother.

471
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,824
Her name was Doris.

472
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:30,161
My grandmother had a place
that's a restaurant in Tangerine, Florida.

473
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:33,235
So I used to imagine
maybe that's where she went.

474
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:40,173
Then I came to terms with the fact
that doesn't really matter, you know?

475
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:44,939
Wherever she went,
she had a good reason to leave here.

476
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,917
She didn't wanna be
my mother anymore...

477
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,584
...and she wasn't coming back.

478
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,527
And now you know a little bit
about my family...

479
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,431
...but I'm still not showing you
my apartment.

480
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:06,366
How bad can it be?

481
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,147
Oh, yeah.

482
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,626
<i>Desmond Elden.</i>

483
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,497
<i>Systems tech at Vericom,
22 years old.</i>

484
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,437
Albert Magloan. Only in Boston
is a guy named Albert Magloan.

485
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:46,907
Mr. Magloan never met a car
he couldn't boost.

486
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,937
The kind of talented individual...

487
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:52,844
<i>...that can start your Cherokee for you
while you're still looking for your keys.</i>

488
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:57,147
James Coughlin. Father was killed
in prison, mother died of HIV.

489
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,813
<i>Shot Brendan Leahey by the cemetery
behind Mishawum when he was 18.</i>

490
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,985
Pled it out. When the judge asked him why
he did it, he said, "I didn't like the kid."

491
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,222
Served nine years for manslaughter.

492
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:11,095
These guys plan and execute
with sophistication and discipline.

493
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,794
And that is not our boy Coughlin.

494
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:18,431
We think the architect is this guy,
Coughlin's best friend, Doug MacRay.

495
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,941
Lives in the same house,
dated Coughlin's sister...

496
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:25,674
...who most likely mules for the Florist,
who used to employ MacRay's father.

497
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,216
You need a fucking Venn diagram
for these people.

498
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:33,817
Mac Sr. Got life for the Nashua job,
which most of you should remember.

499
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,050
Hijacked a bread truck
up to New Hampshire...

500
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,525
...one of the guards saw his face...

501
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,358
...so they executed both of them
with their own weapons.

502
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:45,024
Big Mac's legacy is now no A car driver
is allowed to leave the cab...

503
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,364
...even if there's a gun
to his partner's head.

504
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,632
MacRay did eight months
for going over the counter at a BayBank...

505
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:52,799
...with a nail gun
after he washed out from pro hockey.

506
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:55,639
- Pro hockey?
- Yeah, he was a big deal for a minute.

507
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:58,304
Got drafted, went to camp,
and here's the shocker:

508
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,541
Started making trouble,
fighting with guys.

509
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,021
- Don't they pay you to fight in hockey?
- No, not the guys on your own team.

510
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,751
MacRay came home,
got into the family business.

511
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,524
Same song, got into OxyContin.

512
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:12,825
<i>Hockey ship sailed with the narcotics.</i>

513
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,465
Now, we are a long way away
from a grand jury here.

514
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,533
We'll never get 24-hour surveillance...

515
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:20,262
...unless one of these idiots converts
to Islam.

516
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,269
So we build the case.

517
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,940
All right, let's get to work.

518
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,642
So I've been telling all my friends
about you.

519
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,838
- Oh, yeah? All good, I hope.
- Yeah.

520
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,349
Eh.

521
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:37,681
Oh, yeah.
They say they're overcome with jealousy.

522
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,255
They can't believe your luck.

523
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:45,054
You moved to Charlestown,
hooked up with a rock-breaking townie.

524
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,097
No.

525
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:52,200
They just think it's a rebound.

526
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,232
A rebound from what, the robbery?

527
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,872
I don't know.

528
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,066
I feel estranged from them somehow.

529
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:04,012
What? Why do you look like that?

530
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:09,614
- My brother died on a day like this.
- When was this?

531
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,348
He was little. He had lymphoma.

532
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:19,128
So now on really sunny days
I always think of someone dying.

533
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,497
That's wrong, isn't it?

534
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,101
No.

535
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:29,228
I'm sure he'd be glad
you're thinking about him.

536
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:33,667
This is a good day.

537
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:35,903
I'm having a good time.

538
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,570
Good.

539
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,673
Then you'll miss me while I'm gone.

540
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,033
Money, bitch.

541
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:01,668
Pop.

542
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,836
What the fuck you doing here? Huh?

543
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,602
- Nothing.
- Nothing? What's this?

544
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,405
- Who're you here with, huh?
- No one.

545
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,208
- Let's get out of here.
- You're telling me this is yours?

546
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,044
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Fucking Hawaiian pizza?

547
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:15,810
- Sit down.
- Let's hit the road.

548
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,386
- I gotta go.
- Sit the fuck down. Just sit down.

549
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,798
- Hi.
- Hi.

550
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,004
- Hey.
- Claire.

551
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,298
- I'm Jem.
- Jim?

552
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:37,964
Jem. Jem. It's just Jem, yeah.

553
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,973
I'm friend of this loser right here.

554
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:43,602
- Nice to meet you.
- Sit down, sit down, relax. All right?

555
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:55,452
So I saw your fucking Avalanche
parked around the corner, so...

556
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:56,752
The Avalanche?

557
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,657
- A truck.
- Fucking truck. His work truck right there.

558
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:03,666
- Dougy's quite the worker.
- Yeah.

559
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:06,029
Have you two known each other
a long time or...?

560
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:09,866
Since we were 6.
We're like brothers. Right?

561
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,836
But he's never mentioned a word
about you.

562
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,672
The secrets with this one, you know, huh?

563
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,515
Did you say your name was Jim
or Jem?

564
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:25,985
It's Ji... Je...
Well, it's both, actually.

565
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,751
Teachers, when we were growing up,
used to always say:

566
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,394
"Hey, you can have this one.
He's a real gem."

567
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:33,896
So I guess it kind of stuck.

568
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:37,732
Whatever. I don't know.

569
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,995
So, what do you do
for yourself there, Claire?

570
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,036
Oh, I work at a bank.
I'm a bank manager.

571
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,800
You're a bank manager?
Sounds fun. What bank?

572
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:48,103
Cambridge Merchants. Just over there.

573
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,771
Cambridge Merchants. Wait, that's the one
that just got robbed, isn't it?

574
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,678
It got robbed, yeah. It did, yeah.

575
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:57,287
I read about that. It's crazy.

576
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,449
So then how is it that you two met?

577
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,715
Um...

578
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,652
We met at a Laundromat.

579
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:05,955
Okay.

580
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,620
Love among the bleach, right?

581
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,561
Hey, it happens more than you think.

582
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:18,665
Hey, Claire, don't get too used
to your life of leisure here.

583
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,971
Dougy here, he's a real workaholic,
you know.

584
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,614
He's always taking his work home
with him.

585
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,249
Aren't you?

586
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,583
- All right.
- All right, brother.

587
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,322
Take care of yourself, all right?
Be good.

588
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,618
I'll see you at home.
It was nice to meet you.

589
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,124
You too.

590
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:46,767
Well, I guess you haven't been telling
all your friends about me.

591
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:56,240
Who you following, Jem?
Me or her?

592
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:58,574
I told you, I made the Avalanche.

593
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,314
Nothing to worry about.
It's all under control.

594
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:04,351
Oh, so you're trying to get us
jammed up?

595
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,786
- Is that it?
- I'm trying to get you jammed up.

596
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:10,092
Tell me you got a move here, Dougy.

597
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:14,027
Because the only way I see it is you
got sprung like a goddamn bear trap...

598
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:18,396
...on some toonie pussy who happens
to be the one goddamn person... Fuck!

599
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:21,697
The one person that can give us
to the fucking feds.

600
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:27,844
Calm down, all right?

601
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:30,376
Don't you think we need to be smart
right now?

602
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,573
- Smart?
- Yeah.

603
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:36,282
Let's start fucking all the witnesses.
All right?

604
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:40,651
Yeah, I'm blowing the assistant manager.
Am I smart now? Huh?

605
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:45,090
And no, I didn't tell the other guys,
only because they'd flip the fuck out.

606
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,726
And I want them fucking ready
for the next thing.

607
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,025
I told you, the next fucking thing's
not ready.

608
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,360
Then make it ready.

609
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:55,266
I don't like the guards
on the next thing, all right?

610
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:57,737
One kid is like fucking G.I. Joe.

611
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:02,174
He wears the vest on the outside, tucks
his pants into his fucking combat boots.

612
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,041
The truck's fucking waist-high.

613
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:07,047
We'll find another truck
with a driver...

614
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:10,015
...who's a fucking fat kid
with his fucking shit untucked...

615
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:13,281
...who don't think he's Special Forces.
- Yeah?

616
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:16,358
All right, look, I know you're
happy in Fuck City over there...

617
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:19,291
...but I waited nine years in Walpole
for you, motherfucker.

618
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:21,658
Just nine years, that's all.

619
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,965
I'm done waiting.

620
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:29,697
This is the last one.
We're hitting pause after this.

621
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:34,099
We get pinched,
remember whose idea this was, okay?

622
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:37,244
Be ready on Friday.

623
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:54,720
<i>Visitors, straight ahead.</i>

624
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:27,660
- Who you seeing?
- Stephen MacRay.

625
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,905
Twelve.

626
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:48,745
- Right down there.
- Thanks, Lenny.

627
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:13,207
You all right? Every time I come up
here now it's the red pajamas.

628
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,402
You still getting in trouble, Dad?

629
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:19,640
Hey, you know how it is.
I can't take no shit.

630
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:22,513
You're getting a little old
for that bullshit, aren't you?

631
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:25,280
Fucking Southie kids.
They wanna run everything.

632
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:28,948
Listen, you put a year together of
good behavior and get your points down...

633
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:31,356
...you get classed out
over to Norfolk, Dad.

634
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:34,520
No one's gonna bother you there.
Nobody fights, you know?

635
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:37,462
They got fucking Ben & Jerry's
ice cream and shit.

636
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:41,866
Well, some things you gotta deal with
yourself, you know?

637
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:47,908
All right.

638
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:58,912
I'm thinking about taking a trip.

639
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,254
- Going dark for a minute.
- Taking heat?

640
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,454
Nah, just making a change.

641
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:07,324
Yeah, don't tell me.

642
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:08,863
"Making a change."

643
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:11,626
Either you got heat or you don't.

644
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,734
I heard a bread truck got dropped.

645
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,370
Oh, yeah? I didn't hear about it.

646
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,505
Okay.

647
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:24,542
You got five minutes. Five minutes.

648
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,216
Let me ask you something.

649
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:29,378
In case I don't see you again.

650
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:35,084
How come you never...?

651
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,228
How come you never looked for her?

652
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,924
Uh...

653
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:43,993
Looked for who?

654
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,861
For Ma.

655
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:51,470
For my mother.
How come you never looked for her?

656
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,907
How come you never tried to call nobody
or look for her, or ask around?

657
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:57,273
Look, when your mother left...

658
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:02,745
...you cried so hard you were throwing up.
All over the parlor.

659
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:07,151
So I told you if you looked around
you might find her.

660
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,451
Just to give you an activity.

661
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:12,857
I didn't think you'd carry it
like a fucking disease.

662
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,562
What, you wanna think
she was an angel?

663
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,630
Go ahead.

664
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,669
But look out your front door.

665
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,536
How many 22-year-old girls
are out there...

666
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:30,146
...they're fucking around
with kids they don't want...

667
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:34,580
...and, you know,
no sense in their heads.

668
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:38,578
And your mother wasn't no different.

669
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:40,848
That's the hard truth.

670
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:45,317
I made my peace with it.
You make yours.

671
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:50,459
I didn't look for her
because there was nothing to find.

672
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:03,479
Look, I gotta die five times
before I get out of here...

673
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:07,174
...but I'll see you again.

674
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:10,215
This side or the other.

675
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:45,755
<i>So I saw your picture yesterday.</i>

676
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:51,524
- Are you sure it was me?
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

677
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:55,594
- Oh, the Boys & Girls Club?
- Yeah.

678
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,825
It was under a "local heroes" banner.

679
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:01,402
Yeah. They got a real low standard
for who qualifies on that.

680
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:03,396
Apparently you were drafted.

681
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:09,239
Yeah. I was slow.
And I couldn't skate backwards.

682
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:12,539
You're supposed to be able to skate
backwards in pro hockey.

683
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:17,210
But I could shoot, you know?
I could hit anything with a hockey puck.

684
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:22,951
But I got drafted and I just didn't do
what it took to make the team.

685
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:27,756
And when I got a second chance,
I blew that too.

686
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:32,530
They sent me home and that was it.

687
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:35,137
I look at that picture
and I see a 20-year-old kid...

688
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,035
...who thinks he's, you know,
got it all figured out.

689
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:42,972
Right before he's about
to throw it all away.

690
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:56,925
Hey, I don't wanna rush anything,
but can we go into your room?

691
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,892
Because my uncle the bus driver
lives right across the way...

692
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,861
...and he can see
right into this apartment.

693
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,700
- Yes.
- Okay.

694
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,205
<i>They win the game
in overtime. Then you flip it over.</i>

695
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,967
<i>Then you go back to Fenway Park.</i>

696
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:49,874
<i>Then you get another great ending
to another...</i>

697
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,525
<i>- 19, we walked through.</i>

698
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:47,101
<i>Nothing appears disturbed.</i>

699
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,469
<i>In this apartment anyway.</i>

700
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,301
Where the fuck's the truck?

701
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:55,341
<i>We shut and locked the door, but...</i>

702
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:58,003
- What happened to 8:45?
- Late is what happened.

703
00:51:58,181 --> 00:51:59,739
Fucking douche bag.

704
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,765
Say your prayers. Here we go.

705
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:30,770
Here we go.

706
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:50,422
Gun!

707
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:53,462
Don't move!

708
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:00,409
- Go! Go!
- Get back! Get back!

709
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:02,602
Get out of the way!

710
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:14,954
<i>Any units in the area, 10-61 in progress.</i>

711
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,422
The call went out!

712
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,017
Fuck.

713
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,929
Get out here, asshole,
I got your friend.

714
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,225
Calm down. Put your gun away,
all right? You're gonna get hurt.

715
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:27,927
Put that fucking gun down now.
I got you, motherfucker.

716
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,862
Jesus!

717
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,841
You should have stayed in the truck, cunt.

718
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:36,469
Let's go!

719
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:39,913
What the fuck just happened?

720
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:43,541
- Goddamn it, I fucking told you.
- Fucking shut the fuck up, all right?

721
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,244
- Fucking knew it.
- Goddamn it!

722
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:50,353
All right, drive. Just take it easy, all
right? Take it easy. Drive slow. Drive normal.

723
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:55,125
- Shit.
- Ah, fuck.

724
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:58,763
They must have been around the corner.

725
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:42,242
Driver, turn your engine off.

726
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:45,076
Hands where I can see them.

727
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:47,307
Fuck.

728
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:50,681
Shut the engine off now.
Put your hands in the a...

729
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,857
Hit the engine block!

730
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:04,497
Go, go, go, go, go!

731
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,315
Go to the fucking switch!

732
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:40,199
Fuck!

733
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,808
How do you like that, motherfucker?

734
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:03,992
Let's go, let's go!

735
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,752
- It's Dez.
- Let's go, let's go!

736
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:07,226
Drop it!

737
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,733
Let's go!

738
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:40,060
Dino.

739
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,527
What?

740
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:43,190
Close the bridge.

741
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:47,395
- What?
- Close the fucking bridge.

742
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:08,182
<i>Alpha 101, Alpha 412, Alpha 407...</i>

743
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:10,519
<i>...en route to the north end
of the bridge.</i>

744
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:12,820
They're going for the bridge.

745
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:54,868
Now, that's how you drive
a fucking car.

746
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,320
All the DNA in Charlestown.

747
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:46,847
<i>You print the inside of the van?</i>

748
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,218
<i>Frawl, the inside of the van
is a volcano.</i>

749
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:53,055
Just find something and make it look
like something that looks like a print.

750
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:56,224
<i>We don't have enough
for a conviction. Fine.</i>

751
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:58,396
<i>But I need to get them in a room.</i>

752
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:01,934
<i>Right now, they are burning the money
bands at some bullshit safe house.</i>

753
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:04,938
All their alibis were paid for
a week in advance.

754
00:59:05,408 --> 00:59:08,309
We're not gonna pull any DNA
off of this or off the switch car.

755
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:11,811
And that, as they say, is that.

756
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:16,384
This is the "not fucking around" crew.
Find me something that looks like a print...

757
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,317
...so I can grab one of these assholes
and shake their tree.

758
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:22,117
This "not fucking around" thing
is about to go both ways.

759
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,010
Turn around for me, will you?

760
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:00,156
Go ahead,
just read what's on that paper.

761
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:06,863
"Come here, get on the ground,
before I pop your fucking teeth out!"

762
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:11,798
Come on, read it. Read it all.
There's about five things there.

763
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:14,407
Uh...

764
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:17,009
What is it with you guys
in Charlestown?

765
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:20,206
Don't they teach you how to read?
There's things here. Read them.

766
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:22,647
I don't wanna read that.
This doesn't sound right.

767
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:25,982
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.
Read the pages, please.

768
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:28,316
I'm trying to make this
sound authenticious.

769
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:30,789
- You got it all fucked up.
- Authen-what?

770
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:35,053
Thanks.

771
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:38,029
- Hey, Dougy. How are you?
- Oh.

772
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:41,496
How you doing?

773
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:43,605
Local crime fighter.

774
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:45,500
What's happening, Dino?

775
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:48,134
I know your father.

776
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:52,608
Yeah. Me too.

777
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:54,875
Got a few years left on his bid.

778
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:57,552
Yeah, one or two.

779
01:00:58,755 --> 01:01:01,087
I hear they got to the old guy.

780
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:03,385
Split him up the back.

781
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:04,821
Fucking animals.

782
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:07,719
You'd think they'd go after
a younger kid.

783
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:11,023
I don't know.
Making a statement, I guess.

784
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,767
Townie crews ain't
what they used to be.

785
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:16,694
Dorchester...

786
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:18,135
...Southie...

787
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:20,709
...Iooking to make a move.

788
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:23,972
Maybe you can change all that
when you get up there.

789
01:01:26,145 --> 01:01:28,909
Let me ask you a question.
What do you call a guy...

790
01:01:29,082 --> 01:01:32,313
...who grows up with a group of people,
gets to know their secrets...

791
01:01:32,485 --> 01:01:34,544
...because they trust him,
and then turns around...

792
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:38,486
...and use those secrets against them,
put those people in prison?

793
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:42,094
You'd call him a rat, right?
You know what I call him?

794
01:01:42,261 --> 01:01:43,922
Dino the dago.

795
01:01:44,097 --> 01:01:46,930
Those people made you
a part of that community.

796
01:01:47,133 --> 01:01:48,930
What did they get for it?

797
01:01:49,402 --> 01:01:51,666
Inside of the fucking can.

798
01:01:52,503 --> 01:01:56,064
You know we lifted a print
off the van? Right?

799
01:02:04,381 --> 01:02:06,508
Special Agent Frawley...

800
01:02:06,817 --> 01:02:07,841
...Douglas MacRay.

801
01:02:10,721 --> 01:02:12,382
You and your boys didn't just...

802
01:02:13,224 --> 01:02:17,285
...roll a Star Market
over in Malden for a box of quarters.

803
01:02:17,661 --> 01:02:19,652
No, you decided to bang it out...

804
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:23,163
...in the North End at 9:00 in the morning.
With assault rifles.

805
01:02:24,134 --> 01:02:27,467
You fucking dummies shot a guard.

806
01:02:28,772 --> 01:02:32,572
Now you're like a half-off sale
at Big and Tall. Every cop is in line.

807
01:02:32,743 --> 01:02:34,574
Fortunately, though, for you...

808
01:02:34,745 --> 01:02:37,509
...this guard,
who is two-thirds to a retard...

809
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:39,273
...has miraculously clung to life.

810
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:41,077
Now, if it were up to me...

811
01:02:41,252 --> 01:02:43,982
...and they gave me two minutes
and a wet towel...

812
01:02:44,355 --> 01:02:46,653
...I would personally asphyxiate
this half-wit...

813
01:02:46,824 --> 01:02:49,019
...so we could string you up
on a federal M1...

814
01:02:49,193 --> 01:02:51,388
...and end this story
with a bag on your head...

815
01:02:51,562 --> 01:02:54,395
...and a paralyzing agent
running through your veins.

816
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:58,932
This isn't fucking townie hopscotch
anymore, Doug.

817
01:03:00,538 --> 01:03:02,802
But I did want to say one thing.

818
01:03:04,308 --> 01:03:06,640
You're here today
so I could personally tell you...

819
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:09,779
...that you are going to die
in federal prison.

820
01:03:10,648 --> 01:03:12,809
And so are all your friends.

821
01:03:13,183 --> 01:03:14,741
No deal.

822
01:03:15,152 --> 01:03:16,346
No compromise.

823
01:03:17,655 --> 01:03:19,623
And when that day comes...

824
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:22,691
...when you start trying to be
my hero collaborator so hard...

825
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:25,829
...that I have to slap you to shut up...
And it will come...

826
01:03:25,996 --> 01:03:31,866
...despite your pitiable,
misguided, Irish omerta.

827
01:03:32,036 --> 01:03:35,528
- When your code of silence
finally gives way...

828
01:03:35,706 --> 01:03:40,769
...to fear of trafficking in cigarettes
to prevent sexual enslavement...

829
01:03:42,112 --> 01:03:46,947
...I just want you to know that it's gonna
be me who tells you to go fuck yourself.

830
01:03:51,722 --> 01:03:56,091
Hey, next time you guys
wanna take pictures of me, just call ahead.

831
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:58,387
You know, we can do better
than a barbeque.

832
01:03:58,562 --> 01:04:00,792
A calendar shoot. You know?

833
01:04:00,965 --> 01:04:02,660
Maybe topless, lubed up.

834
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:04,733
Whatever you guys are into.

835
01:04:05,669 --> 01:04:08,194
FBI car antennas
are half-inch matte black...

836
01:04:08,372 --> 01:04:11,102
...about three-quarters the way down
the rear windshield.

837
01:04:11,275 --> 01:04:12,503
Statie are pigtailed...

838
01:04:12,676 --> 01:04:14,439
...B.P.D., half and half.

839
01:04:14,845 --> 01:04:18,872
Every peewee in the town knows
what an FBI rear antenna looks like.

840
01:04:19,049 --> 01:04:22,678
So, in the future, if you guys
are gonna try to be slick...

841
01:04:23,387 --> 01:04:25,446
...be slicker than a 6-year-old.

842
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:27,919
I gotta get back to work.

843
01:04:28,258 --> 01:04:29,850
Can I go?

844
01:04:33,464 --> 01:04:35,295
Good luck with that print.

845
01:05:05,829 --> 01:05:07,387
<i>Good morning, Cambridge Savings.</i>

846
01:05:07,564 --> 01:05:10,260
Claire Keesey, please.
She's the manager.

847
01:05:10,434 --> 01:05:13,267
<i>Oh, she's no longer working here.</i>

848
01:05:13,437 --> 01:05:14,927
<i>- Since when?
- Friday.</i>

849
01:05:15,105 --> 01:05:19,007
Just get the warrant. Land, cell, e-mail,
fax, Skype. The whole fucking thing.

850
01:05:23,981 --> 01:05:26,142
Why didn't you tell me
you quit your job?

851
01:05:26,316 --> 01:05:27,340
I don't know.

852
01:05:27,518 --> 01:05:29,509
Why don't you tell me
what's in the box?

853
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,187
- What, this?
- Mm-hm.

854
01:05:31,588 --> 01:05:37,527
Anybody call you or say anything to you
or anything like that? After?

855
01:05:37,695 --> 01:05:38,753
Mm. Nope.

856
01:05:38,929 --> 01:05:40,954
No? Well, what are you gonna do?

857
01:05:41,131 --> 01:05:42,462
You know what? I don't know.

858
01:05:42,633 --> 01:05:47,195
I can teach, volunteer full-time.

859
01:05:47,371 --> 01:05:48,804
I have a little saved.

860
01:05:48,972 --> 01:05:50,405
So...

861
01:05:51,942 --> 01:05:54,342
What if I told you
I was gonna quit my job too?

862
01:05:55,412 --> 01:05:57,141
Well, then I guess I'd have company.

863
01:05:58,048 --> 01:06:00,676
We'd do it together. Here.

864
01:06:01,118 --> 01:06:03,382
It's just a necklace, that's all.

865
01:06:05,489 --> 01:06:07,616
Why don't we go away together.

866
01:06:07,791 --> 01:06:10,351
Take a trip for a minute, you know?
Something like that.

867
01:06:10,527 --> 01:06:12,688
You know, just fun.

868
01:06:13,263 --> 01:06:14,287
Doug.

869
01:06:14,465 --> 01:06:16,729
Is it right?
Took me forever trying to pick it.

870
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:20,165
- Arguing with the lady, and...
- It's beautiful, but it...

871
01:06:20,337 --> 01:06:22,862
Well, as long as you didn't,
you know, sell your truck.

872
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,270
Someone took over the payments.

873
01:06:27,177 --> 01:06:29,338
You know, people get up every day...

874
01:06:29,513 --> 01:06:31,913
...tell themselves
they're gonna change their lives.

875
01:06:32,082 --> 01:06:33,811
They never do.

876
01:06:34,852 --> 01:06:36,843
I'm gonna change mine.

877
01:06:37,387 --> 01:06:39,321
Why don't you do it with me.

878
01:06:41,125 --> 01:06:44,185
Okay, well, where would we go?

879
01:06:44,361 --> 01:06:47,125
Come with me, I don't care.
We could go wherever you want.

880
01:06:47,531 --> 01:06:50,932
I mean, you know, there's things...

881
01:06:51,602 --> 01:06:54,366
There's a few things
you still don't know about me.

882
01:06:56,173 --> 01:06:57,663
What do you mean?

883
01:06:58,542 --> 01:07:02,603
Nothing. I just understand if you have
some reservations, you know?

884
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:07,479
Between the kind of things people say
about me and the things I'm not proud of...

885
01:07:07,651 --> 01:07:09,141
...don't leave a lot of room.

886
01:07:09,319 --> 01:07:10,616
I know who you are.

887
01:07:10,788 --> 01:07:11,812
You do?

888
01:07:11,989 --> 01:07:15,049
Yeah, I do. Yeah.

889
01:07:15,425 --> 01:07:17,620
Does that mean you want to go with me?

890
01:07:18,896 --> 01:07:20,193
Yeah.

891
01:07:21,398 --> 01:07:23,161
Let's start now.

892
01:07:24,334 --> 01:07:25,801
Okay.

893
01:07:27,938 --> 01:07:29,405
<i>Frawl.</i>

894
01:07:31,675 --> 01:07:33,074
What is it?

895
01:07:33,243 --> 01:07:36,940
Phone conversation between Claire Keesey
and a burner cell about an hour ago.

896
01:07:37,114 --> 01:07:39,674
See if you can recognize the voice.

897
01:07:40,784 --> 01:07:43,082
<i>Hey, can I come over?
I want to talk to you.</i>

898
01:07:43,253 --> 01:07:45,118
<i>Yeah. Where have you been?</i>

899
01:07:45,522 --> 01:07:46,921
<i>Sorry, I got held up.</i>

900
01:07:47,090 --> 01:07:48,921
<i>I'm coming over from my place.</i>

901
01:07:49,092 --> 01:07:51,060
<i>Will you come down the back
and let me in?</i>

902
01:07:53,897 --> 01:07:56,127
<i>Hadn't realized you'd left
your job at the bank.</i>

903
01:07:57,134 --> 01:08:00,831
Uh... Oh, yeah. Yeah. Last week.

904
01:08:02,739 --> 01:08:05,071
I'm sorry,
was I supposed to notify someone?

905
01:08:09,813 --> 01:08:11,440
Fancy.

906
01:08:11,682 --> 01:08:13,240
Yeah. It was a gift.

907
01:08:19,756 --> 01:08:21,815
We have our suspects.

908
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:25,820
I came by to share this with you.

909
01:08:29,166 --> 01:08:31,157
James Coughlin.

910
01:08:31,401 --> 01:08:33,369
Albert Magloan.

911
01:08:34,705 --> 01:08:36,229
Desmond Elden.

912
01:08:36,406 --> 01:08:39,341
Part of a crew that we tied
into the bank job at North End...

913
01:08:39,509 --> 01:08:43,570
...and at least three other
armored car robberies.

914
01:08:48,051 --> 01:08:49,575
Look familiar?

915
01:08:52,256 --> 01:08:54,781
You opened the safe for him.

916
01:08:55,559 --> 01:08:57,959
He left you unharmed...

917
01:08:58,128 --> 01:09:03,191
...and now the two of you are carrying on a
relationship about which you lied to the FBI.

918
01:09:03,367 --> 01:09:04,425
I was wrong.

919
01:09:05,435 --> 01:09:07,494
You do need a lawyer.

920
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:16,906
Something wrong with the apartment?

921
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,310
No. Florist.

922
01:09:20,217 --> 01:09:21,377
Florist? What?

923
01:09:21,551 --> 01:09:23,041
Came through.

924
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,785
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- It's large, Dougy.

925
01:09:26,957 --> 01:09:29,118
- It's large.
- We're smoked. Punt it.

926
01:09:29,526 --> 01:09:33,690
Look, pick up an extra guy. All right?
Or go with three guys.

927
01:09:33,864 --> 01:09:36,094
Or fucking be smart and boot it.

928
01:09:36,266 --> 01:09:38,234
Oh, so you're not going?

929
01:09:39,403 --> 01:09:40,665
No.

930
01:09:42,472 --> 01:09:43,871
And why's that?

931
01:09:44,041 --> 01:09:46,373
Because we got a ton of heat on us,
for one thing.

932
01:09:46,543 --> 01:09:48,977
We'll put a move on.
We've done it a hundred times.

933
01:09:49,146 --> 01:09:52,172
You know what? Forget it.
Do what you want to do. I'm done.

934
01:09:52,349 --> 01:09:53,976
- What? What?
- I'm done.

935
01:09:54,151 --> 01:09:56,449
- You're done?
- What does it sound like?

936
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:59,316
- I don't know. What's that mean?
- What you think it means?

937
01:09:59,489 --> 01:10:01,923
What does that mean?
Sounds like a bunch of bullshit.

938
01:10:02,092 --> 01:10:05,960
I'm putting
this whole fucking town in my rear-view.

939
01:10:08,432 --> 01:10:10,798
There's people I can't let you
walk away from.

940
01:10:10,968 --> 01:10:12,196
What?

941
01:10:12,903 --> 01:10:14,302
Who?

942
01:10:15,906 --> 01:10:17,339
Come on.

943
01:10:20,143 --> 01:10:22,236
Are you serious, Jimmy?

944
01:10:22,946 --> 01:10:24,436
She's not my kid.

945
01:10:26,283 --> 01:10:28,410
Did she tell you it was?

946
01:10:29,453 --> 01:10:31,683
I mean, come the f... Cut it out.

947
01:10:31,855 --> 01:10:33,914
All you give a fuck about
is coke and Xbox...

948
01:10:34,091 --> 01:10:36,958
...now you're trying to play it off
like you care about Shyne?

949
01:10:37,127 --> 01:10:40,028
Know what your problem is?
You think you're better than people.

950
01:10:40,197 --> 01:10:42,859
Mr. Fucking-Clean.
Mr. Fucking-Goddamn-High-and-Mighty.

951
01:10:43,033 --> 01:10:45,763
I'm better than all these people.
I'm better than everybody.

952
01:10:45,936 --> 01:10:48,200
But you grew up right here.

953
01:10:48,772 --> 01:10:50,069
Same rules that I did.

954
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,071
Who the fuck you think you are?

955
01:10:52,242 --> 01:10:54,938
You aren't letting me
or not letting me do shit, all right?

956
01:10:55,112 --> 01:10:56,773
Here's a little cheat sheet for you.

957
01:10:56,947 --> 01:11:00,007
It's never gonna be me and you
and your sister and Shyne...

958
01:11:00,183 --> 01:11:01,775
...fucking playing house up there.

959
01:11:01,952 --> 01:11:05,251
All right? You got it?
Get that in your fucking head!

960
01:11:05,422 --> 01:11:08,414
I'm tired of your one-way
fucking bullshit.

961
01:11:08,592 --> 01:11:12,722
If you wanna see me again,
come down and visit me in Florida.

962
01:11:18,602 --> 01:11:19,626
Cunt.

963
01:11:47,898 --> 01:11:49,832
In the 302...

964
01:11:50,634 --> 01:11:53,296
...feds have me dropping Brendan
right here.

965
01:11:54,871 --> 01:11:57,169
<i>I got him back on Tibbetts.</i>

966
01:11:59,376 --> 01:12:02,345
Fucking guy ran 100 yards
with a bullet in his heart, Dougy.

967
01:12:02,512 --> 01:12:06,642
I mean, the fucking guy should've ran track.
You know what I'm saying?

968
01:12:10,754 --> 01:12:12,119
I didn't ask you to do that.

969
01:12:12,289 --> 01:12:14,416
Yeah, well, you didn't have to, Dougy.
Come on.

970
01:12:15,058 --> 01:12:18,994
They told me Brendan was coming down
here to roll up on you with a Glock 21.

971
01:12:19,162 --> 01:12:22,131
So I came over here,
and I put him in the fucking ground.

972
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,695
Did nine years for it.

973
01:12:27,671 --> 01:12:29,434
Now, you don't gotta thank me...

974
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:31,903
...but you're not walking away.

975
01:12:34,077 --> 01:12:36,944
I'm grateful for everything you done
for me.

976
01:12:38,215 --> 01:12:41,184
Your family took me in
when my father went away.

977
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:45,851
You're like a brother to me.

978
01:12:47,591 --> 01:12:49,286
But I'm leaving.

979
01:12:52,095 --> 01:12:53,722
Gonna shoot me?

980
01:12:54,965 --> 01:12:56,455
Go ahead.

981
01:12:57,734 --> 01:13:00,168
But you're gonna have to shoot me
in the back.

982
01:13:12,382 --> 01:13:14,316
- Don't get up.
- All right.

983
01:13:14,484 --> 01:13:16,247
How you doing, Fergie?

984
01:13:16,419 --> 01:13:20,219
Listen, just wanted to stop by
and tell you myself...

985
01:13:20,991 --> 01:13:23,721
...whatever this thing is you got
going on...

986
01:13:23,894 --> 01:13:26,954
...I think my guys can handle it
without me. You know what I mean?

987
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:29,121
I wouldn't hire them without you.

988
01:13:29,299 --> 01:13:31,233
And I wouldn't hire you without them.

989
01:13:31,401 --> 01:13:32,629
You're a unit.

990
01:13:32,802 --> 01:13:36,602
Look, with all due respect,
I didn't come here for a debate.

991
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:38,801
I'm not doing it.

992
01:13:39,075 --> 01:13:42,943
So, you know, work it out
however you can. I...

993
01:13:43,113 --> 01:13:45,911
Calm down. Okay?

994
01:13:46,082 --> 01:13:48,983
It goes against
my better judgment...

995
01:13:49,719 --> 01:13:52,813
...but just out of respect,
smooth things over...

996
01:13:53,323 --> 01:13:55,621
...just take this for it, all right?

997
01:13:56,226 --> 01:13:57,284
Not gonna cut it.

998
01:13:58,028 --> 01:14:01,020
Do you think I'm gonna put
Joe Flipperhead on this?

999
01:14:01,531 --> 01:14:03,465
You're gonna do what I ask.

1000
01:14:03,633 --> 01:14:04,827
Not gonna cut it, huh?

1001
01:14:07,437 --> 01:14:08,665
Okay.

1002
01:14:08,838 --> 01:14:11,932
Let me ask you something.
Who the fuck do you think you are?

1003
01:14:12,342 --> 01:14:14,435
The only guy in Charlestown
with a gun?

1004
01:14:14,844 --> 01:14:16,778
You guys run numbers and pump dope.

1005
01:14:16,947 --> 01:14:20,007
You're an old guy who don't know
his glory years are behind him.

1006
01:14:20,183 --> 01:14:23,209
I ain't fucking working for you.
Got it?

1007
01:14:23,853 --> 01:14:28,290
You got a problem with that, I live at
551 Bunker Hill Street. Stop by anytime.

1008
01:14:28,458 --> 01:14:30,153
You know where to find me.

1009
01:14:30,794 --> 01:14:32,819
You're gonna do this for me...

1010
01:14:32,996 --> 01:14:35,396
...or I'm gonna clip your nuts...

1011
01:14:35,699 --> 01:14:37,166
...like I clipped your daddy's.

1012
01:14:37,801 --> 01:14:39,325
Don't talk about my father.

1013
01:14:39,502 --> 01:14:42,027
Son, I knew your daddy.

1014
01:14:42,205 --> 01:14:45,140
He worked for me for years. Years.

1015
01:14:45,675 --> 01:14:47,768
Then he wanted his own thing.

1016
01:14:50,513 --> 01:14:51,571
You play the horses?

1017
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:58,117
You know, they either geld a horse
with a knife...

1018
01:14:58,288 --> 01:15:00,222
...or with the chemicals.

1019
01:15:00,724 --> 01:15:02,817
When your daddy said no to me...

1020
01:15:03,293 --> 01:15:05,227
...I did him the chemical way.

1021
01:15:05,829 --> 01:15:07,558
Gave your mother a taste.

1022
01:15:07,731 --> 01:15:09,358
Put the hook into her.

1023
01:15:09,766 --> 01:15:12,098
She doped up good and proper.

1024
01:15:12,869 --> 01:15:15,667
Hung herself with a wire
on Melnea Cass.

1025
01:15:16,306 --> 01:15:19,207
And you? Running around
the neighborhood, looking for her.

1026
01:15:20,076 --> 01:15:22,408
Your daddy didn't have the heart
to tell his son...

1027
01:15:22,579 --> 01:15:25,776
...that he was looking for a suicide doper
who was never coming home.

1028
01:15:27,183 --> 01:15:30,550
If there's a heaven, son,
she ain't in it.

1029
01:15:35,892 --> 01:15:36,950
Oh.

1030
01:15:39,095 --> 01:15:41,529
I hear you got a nice,
sweet new girlfriend.

1031
01:15:41,698 --> 01:15:43,222
Lives on the park.

1032
01:15:44,034 --> 01:15:47,094
I don't want to send her
funeral arrangement to your house...

1033
01:15:48,004 --> 01:15:49,835
...but I will if I have to.

1034
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,865
Now I know where to find you.

1035
01:15:54,678 --> 01:15:56,111
Claire.

1036
01:15:57,113 --> 01:15:58,740
Claire?

1037
01:16:10,427 --> 01:16:11,621
- Hey.
- Get out.

1038
01:16:11,795 --> 01:16:12,989
You okay?

1039
01:16:13,730 --> 01:16:16,164
- Get out.
- Hold on one second.

1040
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:17,823
I have this on 911.

1041
01:16:18,001 --> 01:16:21,164
All right, you need to give me a chance
to explain myself first. Okay?

1042
01:16:21,338 --> 01:16:22,396
No. You had a chance.

1043
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:25,264
Who talked to you?

1044
01:16:26,743 --> 01:16:29,007
The FBI, Doug.

1045
01:16:31,247 --> 01:16:33,147
You have to listen to me.

1046
01:16:33,316 --> 01:16:35,841
You have to let me explain this.
You understand?

1047
01:16:36,019 --> 01:16:39,216
- There's a lot going on here, Claire...
- No, you go to fucking hell!

1048
01:16:39,956 --> 01:16:41,821
- Fucking hell.
- All right, all right.

1049
01:16:41,991 --> 01:16:43,481
All right. All right.

1050
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:45,287
Easy, now.

1051
01:16:46,529 --> 01:16:48,429
Why did you do this to me?

1052
01:16:48,598 --> 01:16:51,396
Claire, I'm sorry. Okay?

1053
01:16:51,568 --> 01:16:54,435
I was gonna tell you.
I came over here that night to tell you.

1054
01:16:54,604 --> 01:16:58,267
What, the night you fucked me?
Is that your thing?

1055
01:16:58,441 --> 01:17:02,969
It's not enough to terrorize someone,
you have to fuck them too?

1056
01:17:03,146 --> 01:17:07,981
- Listen to me. Calm down, okay?
- No. No. Get out. Get out!

1057
01:17:09,486 --> 01:17:14,389
You don't ever let me see you again.
Never, never.

1058
01:18:15,952 --> 01:18:17,385
All right.

1059
01:18:18,855 --> 01:18:20,083
I'm in.

1060
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:23,521
But if anything happens to her...

1061
01:18:23,693 --> 01:18:25,923
...if I think anything
might happen to her...

1062
01:18:26,763 --> 01:18:27,957
...I'm coming back here.

1063
01:18:28,998 --> 01:18:32,024
And I'm gonna kill both of you
in your own shop.

1064
01:18:48,284 --> 01:18:50,013
Hey, Claire?

1065
01:18:51,621 --> 01:18:55,079
I just wanna talk to you,
just for two minutes. Okay?

1066
01:18:55,825 --> 01:18:57,383
Come on.

1067
01:18:58,862 --> 01:19:00,329
Claire, I would never hurt you.

1068
01:19:00,497 --> 01:19:02,931
I don't know what you would...
Don't fucking touch me.

1069
01:19:03,099 --> 01:19:04,259
All right.

1070
01:19:04,667 --> 01:19:05,998
I'm sorry.

1071
01:19:06,503 --> 01:19:08,971
Just listen to me for a second,
all right?

1072
01:19:09,138 --> 01:19:10,628
I will never lie to you again.

1073
01:19:10,807 --> 01:19:12,968
- Really?
- Yes, I promise you.

1074
01:19:13,476 --> 01:19:15,808
Ask me anything you want.
I'll tell you the truth.

1075
01:19:15,979 --> 01:19:17,879
- Why? I won't believe you.
- Yes, you will.

1076
01:19:18,047 --> 01:19:19,071
Why?

1077
01:19:19,249 --> 01:19:21,513
Because you'll fucking hate
the answers.

1078
01:19:26,222 --> 01:19:28,884
- You knew I was the manager in the bank?
- Yup.

1079
01:19:29,058 --> 01:19:31,424
- Were you following me?
- Yes.

1080
01:19:31,794 --> 01:19:33,352
How many banks have you robbed?

1081
01:19:34,230 --> 01:19:35,754
Six trucks, two banks.

1082
01:19:36,199 --> 01:19:37,757
Have you ever killed anyone?

1083
01:19:37,934 --> 01:19:39,458
No.

1084
01:19:40,603 --> 01:19:41,900
Think about it.

1085
01:19:42,605 --> 01:19:43,936
All right?

1086
01:19:44,107 --> 01:19:46,541
I will never lie to you,
I will never hurt you...

1087
01:19:46,709 --> 01:19:51,976
...and if I lose you, I will
regret that for the rest of my life.

1088
01:19:54,884 --> 01:19:57,785
Just wait for me.

1089
01:20:09,799 --> 01:20:13,235
<i>You know, it's funny.
I can see your daddies' faces in you.</i>

1090
01:20:13,403 --> 01:20:14,461
All of youse.

1091
01:20:14,637 --> 01:20:16,366
Reminds me I'm still in the ring.

1092
01:20:16,739 --> 01:20:20,971
Still taking the punches.
Still ahead on points.

1093
01:20:21,344 --> 01:20:24,108
Now, I have a fellow
on the inside there.

1094
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:28,046
He likes to play the ponies.
Has a gambling sickness.

1095
01:20:28,217 --> 01:20:30,845
He couldn't pick a horse
to save his fucking life.

1096
01:20:31,421 --> 01:20:33,685
But courtesy of this sick man...

1097
01:20:34,657 --> 01:20:37,353
...I have this. Hm?

1098
01:20:39,228 --> 01:20:42,026
Well, the gang's all here.

1099
01:20:44,334 --> 01:20:46,097
There's always a weak spot.

1100
01:20:46,269 --> 01:20:48,237
We just need to find it.

1101
01:20:51,808 --> 01:20:55,767
The cash is brought out and stacked
15 minutes before the van does the pickup.

1102
01:20:57,046 --> 01:20:59,139
That is when you hit.

1103
01:20:59,549 --> 01:21:02,313
And Monday morning,
after a four-game stand with New York...

1104
01:21:02,485 --> 01:21:07,388
...60,000 beers, food, merchandise,
total haul:

1105
01:21:07,557 --> 01:21:09,047
Three and a half million.

1106
01:21:13,129 --> 01:21:17,429
Taking down the cathedral of Boston.

1107
01:21:17,667 --> 01:21:18,793
Priceless.

1108
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:36,810
How long you think it's gonna take Rusty
to dump the inside man...

1109
01:21:36,986 --> 01:21:38,180
...when this thing's over?

1110
01:21:38,354 --> 01:21:40,982
Well, he should have picked
better horses.

1111
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:47,090
This is gonna be a motherfucker.
You know that, right?

1112
01:21:48,131 --> 01:21:52,158
Well, if they were easy, kid,
everybody would do them.

1113
01:21:56,673 --> 01:22:00,040
<i>Lined into right field.
A base hit. Youkilis is headed for third base.</i>

1114
01:22:00,209 --> 01:22:02,939
Hey, Bobby. Yeah, three Buds.

1115
01:22:11,254 --> 01:22:14,223
Seem to be having a bit
of a staring contest over there.

1116
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:15,550
What can I say?

1117
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:17,717
Boys like me.

1118
01:22:19,195 --> 01:22:20,526
I bet they do.

1119
01:22:22,365 --> 01:22:24,265
What are you doing down here?

1120
01:22:24,901 --> 01:22:26,129
Slumming?

1121
01:22:27,770 --> 01:22:29,533
I work for the FBI.

1122
01:22:30,506 --> 01:22:32,235
Me too.

1123
01:22:33,609 --> 01:22:35,076
Well, you must be new.

1124
01:22:38,381 --> 01:22:39,871
You're all right.

1125
01:22:40,783 --> 01:22:43,217
It doesn't mean
you're getting fucked, though.

1126
01:22:43,753 --> 01:22:47,211
You gotta chase the rabbit
if you want the tail.

1127
01:22:48,858 --> 01:22:50,155
My mom taught me that.

1128
01:22:54,831 --> 01:22:57,527
You used to hang around
with Doug MacRay a little bit, huh?

1129
01:22:58,701 --> 01:23:00,066
How do you know Dougy?

1130
01:23:00,236 --> 01:23:01,965
We sort of work together.

1131
01:23:02,371 --> 01:23:03,668
Sand and Gravel?

1132
01:23:04,307 --> 01:23:06,036
No. No, no.

1133
01:23:13,382 --> 01:23:15,748
You a pretty decent judge of size?

1134
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:17,581
Depends.

1135
01:23:18,287 --> 01:23:19,754
Size of what?

1136
01:23:21,090 --> 01:23:22,614
How big would you say that is?

1137
01:23:23,493 --> 01:23:24,687
Six inches?

1138
01:23:25,294 --> 01:23:26,761
Over or under?

1139
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:28,154
Under.

1140
01:23:28,331 --> 01:23:29,491
Wrong.

1141
01:23:30,066 --> 01:23:32,296
6.14 inches exactly.

1142
01:23:33,936 --> 01:23:36,063
I know everything there is to know
about money.

1143
01:23:36,305 --> 01:23:39,138
Thickness:0043 inches.

1144
01:23:39,942 --> 01:23:43,878
About one gram.

1145
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:46,514
Which is interesting...

1146
01:23:46,682 --> 01:23:50,482
...because that means that this $20 bill
isn't even worth its own weight...

1147
01:23:50,653 --> 01:23:52,587
...in Oxy.

1148
01:23:58,327 --> 01:23:59,794
So how does it work?

1149
01:24:00,997 --> 01:24:02,794
Bartender gets a call...

1150
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:06,892
...you pick up a package at point A,
deliver it to point B...

1151
01:24:07,069 --> 01:24:09,594
...the Florist gives you C?

1152
01:24:13,409 --> 01:24:15,240
You're thinking of running out on me.

1153
01:24:16,946 --> 01:24:20,006
It's not that simple.
Because, you see...

1154
01:24:21,083 --> 01:24:22,914
...I start waving this around
in here...

1155
01:24:27,657 --> 01:24:29,022
...bad for you.

1156
01:24:33,396 --> 01:24:34,988
I want a lawyer.

1157
01:24:35,331 --> 01:24:37,265
Good. Get one.

1158
01:24:38,201 --> 01:24:40,761
I mean, it's all about protecting
yourself, right?

1159
01:24:41,070 --> 01:24:44,335
Not even yourself. Your daughter.

1160
01:24:44,507 --> 01:24:47,032
Don't talk about my daughter.

1161
01:24:49,312 --> 01:24:51,678
How long were you with MacRay?

1162
01:24:52,782 --> 01:24:54,079
All my life.

1163
01:24:55,384 --> 01:24:57,944
In all those years
that you were together...

1164
01:24:59,856 --> 01:25:03,087
...how many diamond necklaces
did he give you?

1165
01:25:05,928 --> 01:25:07,691
All right, the tools are set.

1166
01:25:07,864 --> 01:25:10,025
Got our body armor.

1167
01:25:13,436 --> 01:25:15,267
You know, this thing goes right...

1168
01:25:15,671 --> 01:25:18,071
...could be your turn
to step away too.

1169
01:25:18,241 --> 01:25:21,210
Yeah. Sure.

1170
01:25:21,444 --> 01:25:23,002
What am I gonna do, Dougy, huh?

1171
01:25:23,179 --> 01:25:27,673
Go down to Margaritaville, drink me
half a yard and fall off fucking bar stools?

1172
01:25:28,217 --> 01:25:29,741
Do me a favor.

1173
01:25:30,319 --> 01:25:32,116
The weight of this thing...

1174
01:25:32,755 --> 01:25:34,848
...pack a parachute at least.

1175
01:25:35,324 --> 01:25:38,020
You know the funniest thing
about being in prison?

1176
01:25:40,062 --> 01:25:42,360
Guys pretending
that they wanna get out.

1177
01:25:44,367 --> 01:25:46,562
I can't do any more time, Dougy.

1178
01:25:49,338 --> 01:25:50,965
So if we get jammed up...

1179
01:25:51,607 --> 01:25:53,541
...we're holding court on the street.

1180
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:13,758
Fuck are you doing here, Kris?

1181
01:26:14,397 --> 01:26:15,659
I need to talk to you.

1182
01:26:15,831 --> 01:26:17,458
Not a great time, hon.

1183
01:26:17,633 --> 01:26:18,827
- I know.
- You know?

1184
01:26:19,001 --> 01:26:20,969
Okay. Well, what do you want?

1185
01:26:21,137 --> 01:26:22,434
Here you go.

1186
01:26:22,905 --> 01:26:24,668
Dez told me you were here.

1187
01:26:26,509 --> 01:26:27,908
I wanna see you before you go.

1188
01:26:28,077 --> 01:26:31,410
Kris, you could do 30 years
for walking in the door.

1189
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:33,707
Okay? Do you understand that?
For being here.

1190
01:26:33,883 --> 01:26:36,943
You can't be bringing your kid
in here, you got it? You can't stay.

1191
01:26:37,119 --> 01:26:39,679
I don't wanna stay,
I wanna go with you.

1192
01:26:40,122 --> 01:26:41,953
- I wanna change too, Dougy.
- Christ.

1193
01:26:42,124 --> 01:26:45,025
Why the fuck can't I change?
I could be a different person.

1194
01:26:45,194 --> 01:26:46,525
Jesus Christ.

1195
01:26:46,696 --> 01:26:49,961
You tell me what you want me to do.
I'll be whoever you want me to be.

1196
01:26:51,334 --> 01:26:53,325
I'm leaving with somebody else.

1197
01:26:57,506 --> 01:26:58,803
Oh, yeah?

1198
01:26:59,408 --> 01:27:00,636
Yeah.

1199
01:27:02,511 --> 01:27:04,411
Why isn't she here then?

1200
01:27:05,648 --> 01:27:07,513
Come on.
What do you want me to tell you?

1201
01:27:07,683 --> 01:27:10,243
She's going away with you,
why isn't she here?

1202
01:27:10,419 --> 01:27:12,353
Where is she? She's not here.

1203
01:27:13,923 --> 01:27:16,153
- Such a trashy little fuck pad.
- Take it easy.

1204
01:27:16,325 --> 01:27:19,453
After a Tiffany necklace,
I thought a room at the Ritz.

1205
01:27:19,862 --> 01:27:21,386
Huh?

1206
01:27:22,565 --> 01:27:23,930
What'd you say?

1207
01:27:25,134 --> 01:27:27,932
Where did you hear that?
Where'd you hear about a necklace?

1208
01:27:28,371 --> 01:27:29,929
A little bird.

1209
01:27:32,308 --> 01:27:35,141
Fucking smartass. Who told you that?
Who told you about a necklace?

1210
01:27:36,612 --> 01:27:39,672
I know you'd rather see a rope
around my neck!

1211
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:43,580
You're getting the fuck out of here.
Let's go.

1212
01:27:43,753 --> 01:27:46,745
Come here, honey.
I know, it's gonna be okay. It's all right.

1213
01:27:46,922 --> 01:27:49,322
- We're coming with you.
- You're getting out of here.

1214
01:27:49,492 --> 01:27:51,323
Dougy, we're fucking coming with you.

1215
01:27:51,494 --> 01:27:54,691
It's time to go. Okay? Here we go.

1216
01:27:54,864 --> 01:27:58,129
Time to go, sweetheart. Okay?

1217
01:27:58,300 --> 01:27:59,790
- I'm not leaving here.
- Let's go.

1218
01:27:59,969 --> 01:28:02,062
- I'm not fucking leaving.
- Take the kid home.

1219
01:28:02,238 --> 01:28:03,899
Get the fuck off me!

1220
01:28:04,073 --> 01:28:05,973
I can walk myself.

1221
01:28:06,475 --> 01:28:08,568
Don't you say no to me!

1222
01:28:11,847 --> 01:28:13,246
Take this.

1223
01:28:20,689 --> 01:28:21,849
Hey.

1224
01:28:22,458 --> 01:28:25,791
Will you quit fucking doing that?
You're making me nervous.

1225
01:28:40,376 --> 01:28:43,675
Yeah, we got a DWI over here, one car.

1226
01:28:43,846 --> 01:28:47,282
Coughlin, Kristina.
She had a kid with her.

1227
01:28:47,950 --> 01:28:50,510
<i>The mother's at Mass General.
She wanted me to call you.</i>

1228
01:28:50,686 --> 01:28:53,314
All right, yeah. I'll be right there.

1229
01:29:21,617 --> 01:29:22,811
Officer.

1230
01:29:23,819 --> 01:29:25,343
Yeah. Let's go.

1231
01:29:32,661 --> 01:29:33,992
Down here.

1232
01:30:27,383 --> 01:30:29,044
There's the door.

1233
01:30:29,618 --> 01:30:32,246
And remember,
you never fucking saw me.

1234
01:30:32,521 --> 01:30:33,681
Okay.

1235
01:30:48,637 --> 01:30:51,367
<i>Dr. Forrest, dial 112, please.</i>

1236
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:54,509
<i>Dr. Forrest, please dial 112.</i>

1237
01:30:58,647 --> 01:31:02,344
Here he is, Mr. Six-Inches.

1238
01:31:04,186 --> 01:31:05,210
What happened?

1239
01:31:05,387 --> 01:31:08,788
You're a crimestopper,
figure it the fuck out.

1240
01:31:10,859 --> 01:31:12,087
Sweetheart.

1241
01:31:13,162 --> 01:31:16,723
I know you have oxycodone,
cocaine and alcohol in your system.

1242
01:31:17,933 --> 01:31:20,493
I know that you have five cars
registered in your name.

1243
01:31:20,669 --> 01:31:24,161
And I know right now, your daughter
is sitting in the back of a state van...

1244
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:26,604
...driven to
the Department of Social Services.

1245
01:31:26,775 --> 01:31:28,367
So how long you wanna do this?

1246
01:31:28,544 --> 01:31:29,704
I'm a person, you know?

1247
01:31:29,878 --> 01:31:32,039
A person
who's gonna need a plea agreement...

1248
01:31:32,214 --> 01:31:34,341
...if you ever want to see your kid again.

1249
01:31:37,987 --> 01:31:40,979
Why is it always I'm the one
who's getting used?

1250
01:31:41,924 --> 01:31:43,255
What do you have?

1251
01:31:49,298 --> 01:31:50,959
Knowing just that...

1252
01:31:52,401 --> 01:31:54,130
...Dougy's going away after.

1253
01:31:55,304 --> 01:31:58,137
Wait, what after? After what?

1254
01:32:00,342 --> 01:32:03,869
Krista, I need you to be smart here.

1255
01:32:04,313 --> 01:32:07,771
This could be a big moment for Shyne.

1256
01:32:08,984 --> 01:32:10,975
Make a huge difference in her life.

1257
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:20,291
We can help you, sweetheart.

1258
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:16,349
<i>- You there?
- I'm here.</i>

1259
01:33:16,518 --> 01:33:19,282
- All set.
- Okay. Go ahead.

1260
01:33:20,022 --> 01:33:21,319
All set.

1261
01:33:29,698 --> 01:33:30,790
Who called 911?

1262
01:33:32,434 --> 01:33:34,026
You the guys who called 911?

1263
01:33:34,203 --> 01:33:35,693
No one from here called.

1264
01:33:35,871 --> 01:33:37,532
Nah, we didn't... It wasn't us.

1265
01:33:37,706 --> 01:33:38,900
We got a 911 call.

1266
01:33:39,074 --> 01:33:40,507
Robbery, guys. Come on.

1267
01:33:40,676 --> 01:33:42,200
- You said a robbery?
- Yeah.

1268
01:33:42,378 --> 01:33:44,073
A call saying you're being held up.

1269
01:33:44,246 --> 01:33:45,907
- Let me call Mike.
- We just walked past Mike.

1270
01:33:46,081 --> 01:33:47,070
He let us in.

1271
01:33:47,249 --> 01:33:50,150
Hey, look, guys. We got a distress call.
All right?

1272
01:33:50,319 --> 01:33:52,753
- So who made the call?
- Nobody called from here.

1273
01:33:53,622 --> 01:33:56,250
No one called? What are we doing here?

1274
01:33:56,425 --> 01:33:59,588
- Hold on. Where's Mike?
- I just told you where Mike was.

1275
01:33:59,762 --> 01:34:00,854
You boys see all right?

1276
01:34:01,029 --> 01:34:03,259
- Huh? You fucking smartass.
- Listen. Listen.

1277
01:34:03,432 --> 01:34:06,458
For our safety, for everyone's safety,
we need to see your IDs.

1278
01:34:06,635 --> 01:34:09,195
Guys, hold up.
We been here all morning. Take it easy.

1279
01:34:09,371 --> 01:34:12,340
My partner asked for your ID.
All right? We don't know you.

1280
01:34:12,508 --> 01:34:16,000
Till we identify all the parties involved here,
we're gonna need some IDs...

1281
01:34:16,178 --> 01:34:18,305
...we need to see
everyone on the ground. Right now.

1282
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:19,708
Whoa, whoa.

1283
01:34:19,882 --> 01:34:22,112
- Get your hand off your weapon.
- Hey, relax.

1284
01:34:28,624 --> 01:34:31,422
- Get on the ground!
- Get on the fucking ground.

1285
01:34:31,794 --> 01:34:33,091
Hands behind your back.

1286
01:34:33,262 --> 01:34:34,422
Face down.

1287
01:34:34,596 --> 01:34:36,996
Behind your back. Come on.

1288
01:34:43,772 --> 01:34:46,832
Get your hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back. Let's go.

1289
01:34:47,009 --> 01:34:48,476
- Take it easy.
- Fuck.

1290
01:34:56,084 --> 01:34:57,312
In the cash room.

1291
01:34:57,486 --> 01:35:01,047
Arnold Washton.
You live at 311 Hazer Street in Quincy...

1292
01:35:01,223 --> 01:35:04,420
...with a wife named Linda
and three small dogs.

1293
01:35:04,593 --> 01:35:06,959
Do not make a distress call.

1294
01:35:07,129 --> 01:35:09,188
Also in the cash room:

1295
01:35:09,364 --> 01:35:14,529
Morton Previtt.
You live at 27 Counting Lane, Randolph.

1296
01:35:14,703 --> 01:35:17,001
Wife, also Linda.

1297
01:35:17,172 --> 01:35:21,199
Morton, the Lindas
want you to open this door.

1298
01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:24,038
We have men outside your homes.

1299
01:35:28,150 --> 01:35:30,983
Back up. Back up.

1300
01:35:52,007 --> 01:35:53,941
You think you're gonna get out of here?

1301
01:35:54,276 --> 01:35:57,575
I got friends that are guards at Walpole.
They'll make your lives hell.

1302
01:35:57,746 --> 01:36:00,044
Well, don't you worry about it,
old-timer.

1303
01:36:00,215 --> 01:36:01,944
No one's going to prison.

1304
01:36:19,902 --> 01:36:21,369
Ten more.

1305
01:36:21,537 --> 01:36:22,765
Right away.

1306
01:36:36,552 --> 01:36:37,780
Picking up.

1307
01:37:09,851 --> 01:37:12,445
<i>...least from the fan base
when the Red Sox win.</i>

1308
01:37:12,621 --> 01:37:16,648
<i>When the Red Sox win in extra innings
and everybody can go home happy...</i>

1309
01:37:16,825 --> 01:37:19,453
<i>...and they're singing "Dirty Water"...</i>

1310
01:37:22,331 --> 01:37:24,299
- How you doing?
- Fucking beautiful.

1311
01:37:26,768 --> 01:37:28,099
Come on.

1312
01:37:36,812 --> 01:37:40,646
Last motherfucker who robbed
the Red Sox like this was Jack Clark.

1313
01:38:30,132 --> 01:38:33,397
Looked around the block.
There's no cars, no vans around. Nothing.

1314
01:38:33,602 --> 01:38:35,729
Maybe we're too early. Or too late.

1315
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:40,000
Let's go. I want this street clear. Come on,
get these people out of here. Let's go.

1316
01:38:40,175 --> 01:38:45,272
We've been trying to hail security for the
cash room. We're not getting a response.

1317
01:38:47,516 --> 01:38:49,541
Okay, let's go.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1318
01:38:49,718 --> 01:38:51,151
Come on.

1319
01:38:55,257 --> 01:38:56,519
Come on.

1320
01:39:00,829 --> 01:39:02,023
Shit.

1321
01:39:22,484 --> 01:39:25,476
- Fuck!
- Let's get the fuck out of here!

1322
01:39:30,892 --> 01:39:32,826
That's us inside.

1323
01:39:34,963 --> 01:39:36,157
Go! Go!

1324
01:39:40,502 --> 01:39:42,902
Fuckers!

1325
01:39:58,086 --> 01:40:00,145
Gloans! Gloans. Fuck.

1326
01:40:02,624 --> 01:40:06,253
- He all right?
- He's all right. They just got the vest.

1327
01:40:15,403 --> 01:40:16,961
Yo, Dez, get the plunger!

1328
01:40:36,358 --> 01:40:38,189
Shut it!

1329
01:40:59,347 --> 01:41:01,212
Dez?

1330
01:41:02,818 --> 01:41:04,308
Come on, come on.

1331
01:41:06,555 --> 01:41:08,045
They look like EMTs.

1332
01:41:08,223 --> 01:41:10,953
<i>I count four. Maybe one down.</i>

1333
01:41:11,126 --> 01:41:12,718
Go.

1334
01:41:15,230 --> 01:41:16,822
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1335
01:41:17,265 --> 01:41:19,529
There's a million fucking cops
out there.

1336
01:41:23,438 --> 01:41:24,735
Cover your ears!

1337
01:41:49,364 --> 01:41:50,422
No!

1338
01:41:57,539 --> 01:41:59,803
- All right, go, go, go.
- All right, move it out.

1339
01:42:16,992 --> 01:42:18,186
Fuck you!

1340
01:42:24,599 --> 01:42:26,726
Move down.
Get them the fuck out of here.

1341
01:42:26,902 --> 01:42:28,767
Meet me at the fucking switch!

1342
01:42:32,841 --> 01:42:35,173
They ain't looking for fucking cops.

1343
01:42:35,543 --> 01:42:37,374
I'm gonna roll out the front...

1344
01:42:37,545 --> 01:42:41,413
...the two of youse beat it out
the side in the fucking cop uniforms.

1345
01:42:42,317 --> 01:42:44,308
The whole fucking force
is out there, kid.

1346
01:42:44,486 --> 01:42:46,716
You know I can take a pinch.

1347
01:42:47,055 --> 01:42:50,320
Don't worry about it.
I'll only give them your first name.

1348
01:43:21,523 --> 01:43:23,081
Clear.

1349
01:43:27,896 --> 01:43:29,591
Okay, go.

1350
01:43:30,432 --> 01:43:31,922
Move, move.

1351
01:43:38,273 --> 01:43:40,434
Hey, don't move. Don't move.

1352
01:43:41,443 --> 01:43:44,207
- Put your weapons down.
- Fuck you. Boston P.D.

1353
01:43:44,379 --> 01:43:47,405
Look out, coming through.
Stand down. Stand down.

1354
01:43:47,582 --> 01:43:48,879
See you in Florida, kid.

1355
01:43:49,484 --> 01:43:51,543
See you when you get back.

1356
01:43:51,886 --> 01:43:53,376
All right. Go.

1357
01:43:53,555 --> 01:43:57,184
All right, guys, let's back up.
Feds got this.

1358
01:44:00,061 --> 01:44:01,551
Hey. Hey.

1359
01:44:01,730 --> 01:44:03,459
You B.P.D. Need to fuck off.

1360
01:44:03,631 --> 01:44:05,929
What are you doing?
It's an FBI crime scene.

1361
01:44:06,101 --> 01:44:07,693
Don't put your hand up to me. Go.

1362
01:44:07,869 --> 01:44:09,564
Jurisdiction, guys. Walk away.

1363
01:44:09,738 --> 01:44:10,898
That's my kill.

1364
01:44:24,652 --> 01:44:26,745
I don't know if we're dealing with...

1365
01:44:26,921 --> 01:44:29,321
...some high level of genius here
with security...

1366
01:44:29,657 --> 01:44:32,524
...but security's saying
they got hit by cops.

1367
01:44:33,028 --> 01:44:34,256
Cops?

1368
01:44:34,429 --> 01:44:37,421
Yeah. Two cops, they said.

1369
01:44:51,746 --> 01:44:53,008
Hold up.

1370
01:44:53,314 --> 01:44:54,372
Where you going?

1371
01:44:55,417 --> 01:44:56,441
Pull up here.

1372
01:45:09,697 --> 01:45:11,790
Officer, can you hold up a minute?

1373
01:45:21,342 --> 01:45:24,869
Visual on Coughlin,
heading south toward Boylston.

1374
01:45:25,046 --> 01:45:26,946
Hotel parking lot on Van Ness.

1375
01:45:27,115 --> 01:45:28,912
He's dressed as B.P.D.

1376
01:45:29,350 --> 01:45:30,476
<i>Copy.</i>

1377
01:45:30,652 --> 01:45:32,176
Officer.

1378
01:45:34,055 --> 01:45:35,579
Coughlin.

1379
01:46:14,362 --> 01:46:16,023
Drop your weapon!

1380
01:46:17,866 --> 01:46:19,458
No!

1381
01:46:21,536 --> 01:46:23,197
Move! Move!

1382
01:46:47,996 --> 01:46:50,521
Coughlin, throw down your weapon.

1383
01:46:52,767 --> 01:46:54,564
Fuck you.

1384
01:46:55,069 --> 01:46:56,661
Let me see those hands, right now.

1385
01:46:56,838 --> 01:46:58,396
Fuck you!

1386
01:47:05,780 --> 01:47:07,509
Move, move.

1387
01:47:08,716 --> 01:47:10,411
You got 30 seconds, asshole.

1388
01:47:39,147 --> 01:47:40,546
Okay.

1389
01:47:40,715 --> 01:47:42,444
I surrender.

1390
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:44,217
I surrender.

1391
01:48:45,947 --> 01:48:48,541
Rusty, something went wrong.

1392
01:48:48,716 --> 01:48:49,876
Come here.

1393
01:49:01,029 --> 01:49:02,394
Fergie.

1394
01:49:03,431 --> 01:49:04,455
Prick.

1395
01:49:31,959 --> 01:49:33,517
Fergie...

1396
01:49:34,228 --> 01:49:36,560
...remember who clipped your nuts
for you.

1397
01:49:37,899 --> 01:49:41,926
I came in hot, saw the suspect run
across the street with a Tec-9.

1398
01:49:42,103 --> 01:49:46,767
I lit up the tires, I jumped out of the cruiser,
engaged the suspect in gunfire.

1399
01:49:47,809 --> 01:49:48,798
So that's when...

1400
01:49:48,976 --> 01:49:50,739
...you get out of your cruiser.
- Yeah.

1401
01:49:50,912 --> 01:49:54,507
At that point, I fired, struck the suspect
at least once or twice.

1402
01:49:54,682 --> 01:49:55,808
Hey.

1403
01:49:56,084 --> 01:49:57,676
<i>Multiple victims down.</i>

1404
01:49:57,852 --> 01:49:59,649
<i>Location, 529 Main Street, Charlestown.</i>

1405
01:49:59,821 --> 01:50:02,289
<i>- Uniformed officers on the scene.
- That's the Florist.</i>

1406
01:50:02,457 --> 01:50:03,981
Hey, Bobby, Bobby, what happened?

1407
01:50:04,158 --> 01:50:05,750
Somebody got Fergie.

1408
01:50:07,495 --> 01:50:09,520
- Jesus Christ, that's gotta be MacRay.
- Fuck.

1409
01:50:16,404 --> 01:50:18,804
<i>Claire, it's me.</i>

1410
01:50:19,073 --> 01:50:20,097
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1411
01:50:21,109 --> 01:50:22,133
<i>I'll be fine. I know.</i>

1412
01:50:22,310 --> 01:50:24,744
<i>But I'm okay. I'm all right.</i>

1413
01:50:24,912 --> 01:50:26,675
<i>Claire, I wanna meet you.</i>

1414
01:50:28,282 --> 01:50:31,615
<i>It's gotta be soon.
I don't have a lot of time.</i>

1415
01:50:33,154 --> 01:50:34,621
<i>Can you meet me?</i>

1416
01:50:35,623 --> 01:50:36,817
<i>Claire, please.</i>

1417
01:50:37,625 --> 01:50:40,059
<i>I need to know. I gotta go.</i>

1418
01:50:41,095 --> 01:50:42,790
Can you come here?

1419
01:50:48,836 --> 01:50:50,861
You want me
to come where you are now?

1420
01:50:51,205 --> 01:50:52,399
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

1421
01:50:56,344 --> 01:50:58,812
I don't think
that's a good idea for me.

1422
01:51:02,617 --> 01:51:03,845
Why?

1423
01:51:09,157 --> 01:51:10,954
What if there are police there?

1424
01:51:13,027 --> 01:51:14,585
There's no one here.

1425
01:51:20,334 --> 01:51:23,269
All right, well, if you think I should
probably come by there...

1426
01:51:23,438 --> 01:51:25,838
...then I guess that's what I'll do. Yeah.

1427
01:51:27,375 --> 01:51:28,535
Okay.

1428
01:51:30,011 --> 01:51:32,809
<i>Claire, listen, I'm...
Listen. Listen to me.</i>

1429
01:51:34,982 --> 01:51:36,472
<i>I'm sorry, okay?</i>

1430
01:51:37,919 --> 01:51:40,114
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

1431
01:51:41,522 --> 01:51:42,853
Remember that.

1432
01:51:43,591 --> 01:51:46,526
<i>Come down in the back
and let me in in about an hour.</i>

1433
01:51:49,397 --> 01:51:50,830
All right?

1434
01:51:52,733 --> 01:51:54,325
I'll see you.

1435
01:51:55,770 --> 01:51:57,533
Wait, Doug? Doug?

1436
01:51:58,673 --> 01:52:00,140
<i>- Yeah.
- I want you to come.</i>

1437
01:52:00,308 --> 01:52:03,209
<i>I really wanna see you.</i>

1438
01:52:07,949 --> 01:52:10,918
It'll be just like one of my sunny days.

1439
01:52:23,197 --> 01:52:24,391
Well...

1440
01:52:26,601 --> 01:52:28,262
...I'm on my way then.

1441
01:52:31,072 --> 01:52:32,096
Bye.

1442
01:52:35,776 --> 01:52:37,676
Goodbye, Claire.

1443
01:52:43,818 --> 01:52:46,013
All right,
I'd say we've done our part here.

1444
01:52:46,187 --> 01:52:48,815
You know what? Not now.

1445
01:52:54,795 --> 01:52:57,593
He says he's coming, I want people
at Logan, South Station...

1446
01:52:57,765 --> 01:53:00,165
...downtown, Greyhound,
subway, everything. Now.

1447
01:53:00,334 --> 01:53:02,564
<i>- The city's covered.
- Good.</i>

1448
01:53:25,359 --> 01:53:28,089
<i>We're secure, and everything's ready.</i>

1449
01:53:34,368 --> 01:53:38,304
- Sir, we need you to stay off the street.
- Just going to work. No problem.

1450
01:53:54,522 --> 01:53:56,251
- How long?
- Forty minutes.

1451
01:53:56,757 --> 01:53:58,622
- Alleyway clear?
- Yes, sir.

1452
01:54:26,487 --> 01:54:29,581
<i>We got nothing.
Still no movement in the alley. Over.</i>

1453
01:54:49,243 --> 01:54:50,801
"My sunny days."

1454
01:54:58,419 --> 01:55:01,183
You know, Claire,
we are a national organization.

1455
01:55:09,263 --> 01:55:12,323
All right, boys, let's pack it up.
He ain't coming.

1456
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:14,968
Let's get the description out.
Let's go.

1457
01:55:15,236 --> 01:55:17,033
We know what he looks like.

1458
01:55:18,105 --> 01:55:19,436
Let's go find him.

1459
01:55:23,077 --> 01:55:24,169
All right. You good?

1460
01:55:24,345 --> 01:55:26,142
Hey, best possible outcome, you know.

1461
01:55:26,313 --> 01:55:28,247
Well done, well done.

1462
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:45,262
<i>All aboard.
Amtrak number 93. All points south.</i>

1463
01:56:06,153 --> 01:56:07,620
It's for you.

1464
01:57:12,820 --> 01:57:16,256
<i>Claire, take this.</i>

1465
01:57:16,557 --> 01:57:19,185
<i>You'll do better with it than I can.</i>

1466
01:57:19,794 --> 01:57:22,388
<i>By the time you read this,
I'll be long gone.</i>

1467
01:57:22,563 --> 01:57:23,825
<i>Not the way I planned it...</i>

1468
01:57:24,331 --> 01:57:28,392
<i>...but for the first time in my life,
I'm leaving this city.</i>

1469
01:57:40,981 --> 01:57:42,005
<i>Maybe if I go...</i>

1470
01:57:43,117 --> 01:57:44,744
<i>...I can stop looking.</i>

1471
01:58:06,774 --> 01:58:08,469
<i>No matter how much you change...</i>

1472
01:58:08,642 --> 01:58:11,543
<i>...you still have to pay the price
for the things you've done.</i>

1473
01:58:14,748 --> 01:58:16,579
<i>So I got a long road.</i>

1474
01:58:22,223 --> 01:58:24,555
<i>But I know I'll see you again.</i>

1475
01:58:30,397 --> 01:58:32,388
<i>This side or the other.</i>
