1
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,042
Driver's name is Arthur Shea.

2
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:09,885
Former Medford police officer
57 years old.

3
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,391
Soon as his partner leaves with
the coal bag...

4
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,804
...Artie cracks The Herald,
and he don't look up till the guy gets back.

5
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,899
Marty MacGuire,
Cummins Armored courier:

6
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:24,813
5'10" 220, 52 years old.

7
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,982
Picks up every Wednesday and Friday
at exactly 8:12.

8
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,823
Makes $110 a day. Carries a SIG 9.

9
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,243
And he's about to get robbed.

10
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,118
We're fucked if we see a helicopter,
we're fucked if we see SWAT.

11
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,834
We see a cruiser, stop, take out
the engine blocks, keep moving.

12
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,248
No one needs to get hurt.

13
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,382
Now, these guards
like to test you, though.

14
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,465
They want to get hurt for $10 an hour,
don't get in the way.

15
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,885
Let's go.

16
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,118
Move!

17
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,123
All right, now getaway
from the counter!

18
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,125
Go! Go! Go! Everybody away!

19
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,581
Back against the wall.

20
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,456
You! Away from the computer!

21
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,501
-Give me the fucking key!
-Back up! Back! Go! Go!

22
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,045
-Get up! Get up!
-Get the fucking door!

23
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,258
Get on the ground!

24
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,220
-Get down on the ground.
-Get your fucking ass on the ground!

25
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,884
Move! Go, go, go, go!

26
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,139
-On the floor!
-I need everybody's BlackBerrys.

27
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,728
-Everybody on the floor.
-Slide your BlackBerrys up.

28
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,313
Take off your fucking shoes!

29
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,776
BlackBerrys to the front!
Slide your fucking phones up.

30
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,191
-The fuck you looking at?
-Take your shoes off.

31
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,410
Get the cash drawers. Let's go.

32
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,413
-Take off your fucking shoes!
-Take off your shoes.

33
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,495
Bank manager, let's go.
Get up. Let's go.

34
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,455
Get up, come on, get up. Let's go.

35
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,962
Not you. You. Get up. Let's go.
Come on.

36
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,666
-You trying to be a hero?
-Jesus Christ!

37
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,961
-When's the time lock set for?
-09:00.

38
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,845
Don't lie to us, it's 8:15.

39
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,133
Listen, it's not your money.
You understand? Don't lie to us again.

40
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,644
Hey, sweetheart, in the corner.
Get in the corner. You too, brother-man.

41
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,442
Go. Go.

42
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,032
No distress call. Open it clean.

43
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,373
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Don't stall,

44
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,046
This guy a fucking friend of yours?

45
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,761
Let's go!

46
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,469
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

47
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,973
Take your time, okay?

48
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,638
Breathe. Go.

49
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,743
Okay, get back. Get out of the way.

50
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,605
Front door.

51
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,574
-Hello.
-Front door.

52
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,444
Hey, you guys open?

53
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,551
We gotta go.

54
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:24,142
Let's go. Let's bleach it up.

55
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,850
-Go, go, go.
-Let's bleach it up.

56
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:31,480
-Come on, let's go. We gotta go.
-Hold it. Silent alarm, this address.

57
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,565
-Who did it?
-Look, nobody did anything.

58
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,240
-What? Huh? What'd you say?
-Nobody did anything.

59
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,659
-You pull the alarm?
-No. No.

60
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,569
-Did you?
-I didn't pull any alarm.

61
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,114
We were leaving,
you motherfucker! You fuck!

62
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,826
Easy, easy. That's enough.

63
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,081
-All right? Easy.
-You fuck!

64
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,716
You fucker. We were out the door,
you fuck.

65
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,172
Let's go.

66
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,013
Where's your purse?

67
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,194
What the fuck is this?

68
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,860
The cops get us walled in,
we're gonna need her.

69
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,949
Sit down. Go.

70
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,048
Head for the boulevard.

71
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,513
You're gonna be okay.

72
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,136
All right? No one's gonna hurt you.

73
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,922
What's up?

74
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:22,712
Boosted a city work van.
Which still hasn't been reported stolen.

75
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,720
Probably too busy working.

76
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,098
Used the van to screen the door.

77
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,351
Bleached the entire place for DNA.

78
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,978
Kills all the clothing fiber,
so we can't get a match.

79
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,606
Silent bell
came from cage number two.

80
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,766
Assistant manager's at Beth Israel.

81
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,607
Our guys waited for the time lock
to expire...

82
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,272
...then they had the manager
open sesame.

83
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,740
Under duress?

84
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,781
I don't know.

85
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,778
Ten foot steel safe.

86
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,494
Only as strong
as the guy with the key.

87
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,582
Found the dye packs and the tracers.

88
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,552
Found the van, Torched.

89
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,054
-Where is it?
-Where do you think?

90
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,150
-Nice to be back home, Dino?
-Yeah.

91
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:23,818
It's all the love I get
makes the homecoming feel so warm.

92
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,569
Could be 50 people here
eyewitnessed these guys.

93
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:32,456
And 50 hands on a bible
saying they never saw nothing.

94
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,123
Well, it's a pro job.

95
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,499
All the pro guys I know are away...

96
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,835
...so I guess we got new pro guys.

97
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,930
The part of the job where
we get to do something...

98
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:53,014
...that has no point and yields no results.
Excuse me.

99
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,562
Anybody see who lit this van on fire?

100
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,406
Is that where we are now?

101
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,870
Where's Jem?

102
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,373
Stopped on the way
to light a couple house tires...

103
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,160
...stick up a liquor store, maybe,
I don't know.

104
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,500
-Are we taking hostages now?
-No, we're not taking hostages now.

105
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,837
-You gonna talk to this fucking asshole?
-For one thing--

106
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,126
Hey.

107
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,011
Speak of the fucking devil.

108
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,548
You made it.

109
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,555
-Take the scenic route?
-We got a problem.

110
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,719
-What?
-Well, look.

111
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,643
So what?

112
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,558
What's the matter?
Let me see that.

113
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,567
Fuck.
Oh, shit.

114
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,275
-See the address on that?
-Bitch lives four blocks away.

115
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,690
Yeah, I know
where we are, Gloans. Fuck.

116
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,076
We gonna see this bitch
on the street every day?

117
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,406
She didn't see anything.

118
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:53,991
Jesus, are you sure?

119
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,248
-Taking her for a ride didn't help.
-Yeah.

120
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,125
Oh, fuck.
All right. I'm gonna handle it.

121
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,581
How you gonna handle this?

122
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,417
I'm gonna stalk her
like a fucking A car, we'll find out.

123
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,582
-Find out what?
-If she needs to get scared.

124
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,422
-She's already scared.
-Well, maybe not scared enough.

125
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,433
Thanks, Kathy.

126
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:21,265
Ms. Keesey. Special Agent Adam Frawley,
Violent Crimes and Robbery.

127
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,435
Derek here is gonna take some
elimination prints.

128
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,312
I see you've given
a preliminary statement.

129
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,606
I want to talk to you
about your abduction.

130
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:30,898
Okay.

131
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,736
-I understand they threatened you.
-Mm-hm.

132
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,497
One of them took my license.

133
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,121
And did you try to escape
at any point?

134
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,164
No.

135
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,873
Is there anything you can identify
about the men? Anything you'd testify to?

136
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,509
I didn't try to escape
because they had guns.

137
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,260
I understand.

138
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,927
Then they just let you go?

139
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,638
-Yeah. They just let me go.
-Thanks.

140
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,896
When someone endures
an experience like this...

141
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,811
...there are very often
residual effects.

142
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,317
It's gonna be okay.

143
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,987
Did they say anything?

144
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:17,655
"if you talk to the FBI, we'll come
to your house and fuck you and kill you."

145
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,447
Are you gonna take care of it?

146
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,667
-I'll do it.
-Why are you gonna do it?

147
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,827
You're the reason
we're having this conversation.

148
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,668
-I'm gonna get it done.
-What are you gonna get done? Huh?

149
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,091
You get picked up
for intimidating a witness.

150
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,799
You walk within 100 feet of her,
that's 10 years. Okay?

151
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:37,011
You got two strikes against you already.
They're gonna bury you under the jail.

152
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,264
How much money's in the sack?

153
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,224
All right, we got 90 a pop.

154
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,685
Minus what I had to shave off
for the Florist.

155
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,316
Hey, Jem, what happened
with the assistant manager?

156
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,313
Yeah. Well, next time Skeletor comes
in the bank with an AK...

157
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,699
...I think he's gonna think twice
about hitting that alarm, isn't he?

158
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,905
He's lucky he just got tuned up.

159
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,367
Are you gonna catch them?

160
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,701
Yes.

161
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,493
This is the FBI.
We're not completely inept.

162
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,543
In fact...

163
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,376
...I know where they are.

164
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,509
Three hundred and seventy
bank robberies in Boston last year.

165
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,046
More per capita than
anywhere else in the world.

166
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:20,558
The guys like this, hardcore guys, pros,
90 percent of them...

167
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:24,187
...emanate from a one-square-mile
neighborhood called Charlestown.

168
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,939
-Familiar with it?
-You must be kidding me.

169
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,731
First thing B.P.D. does
when there's an armored-car robbery?

170
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,692
-Close the Charlestown Bridge.
-And he's from Charlestown.

171
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:36,734
They use each other's yards, houses.
They're like rats.

172
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,409
They ditch us pretty quick.

173
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,866
Heisting banks is a trade in Charlestown.

174
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:45,034
The way villages in old Europe
used to be known for certain crafts.

175
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,076
In the town,
it's banks and armored cars.

176
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,748
I don't understand it, but it makes it easier
when you know which bridge to close.

177
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,757
Quinlan will set you up with a detail.

178
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:58,088
Meantime, if there's anything your
witness specialist can't do for you ....

179
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:02,676
You got nothing to worry about.
We're gonna find these guys.

180
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,447
-Hi, how you doing?
-Good. How are you?

181
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,859
-Good. Come in.
-Nice to see you.

182
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,743
-Good to see you.
-How have you been?

183
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:24,497
-Good. Come in and have a seat.
-Thanks, Margie.

184
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,413
-Can I get you guys anything?
-We're fine. Thank you.

185
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:31,125
-Okay, well, Mike'll be right out.
-Terrific.

186
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,594
Really done well for himself.

187
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,384
Yeah.

188
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:49,355
He got good money
for that place in the town.

189
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,315
Why does anybody move to Saugus?

190
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:57,814
It's gonna take us an hour
to get over the Portagee Slide.

191
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,527
Yep.

192
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,408
Jesus.

193
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,326
This shit with the Florist
is getting old, man.

194
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,491
I'm investing in a marquee score.

195
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,002
All right? So we gotta
make a few payments.

196
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,037
Fuck making payments to him.

197
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,956
Hey, let me give you some advice.

198
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,501
Money don't care where it came from,
all right?

199
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,170
The guy's a fucking
Lucky Charms Irishman...

200
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,680
...who can't find no one
to sell his AKs to...

201
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,342
...so he's selling narcotics,
trying to be the boss.

202
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,512
You didn't seem to care
when you were dropping 2 grand a week...

203
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,351
...on Monsters and Yay, did you?

204
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:34,859
Look, there's a difference between
a dealer and a straight killer, all right?

205
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:38,271
So he dropped a few Dominicans.
What, are you picky?

206
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,147
Hey, guys.

207
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,191
-Hey, Mike.
-Hey, Mike.

208
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,619
-Here you go, guys.
-Hey.

209
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,904
Here you go.

210
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,368
-Hundred G's?
-That's right.

211
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,370
Look at this.

212
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,127
-Like a newborn baby. All right.
-That's it.

213
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,880
-Take care, guys.
-All right. Good to see you, Mike.

214
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,881
-Looking good.
-All right.

215
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,094
-Hundred pounds.
-Hundred grand.

216
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,343
There you go.

217
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,382
-Green money.
-All right.

218
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:10,391
-Be smart, brother. We'll see you.
-Thanks. Thank you.

219
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,654
-Hey, Rusty. How you doing?
-Hey, Jem. What's up? How are you?

220
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,485
Fergie. Kid's here.

221
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,359
Hey, Fergie.

222
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,696
-Here you go.
-How's it going, son?

223
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:32,242
All right. You run that under the sink,
all right?

224
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,497
Trust me.

225
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,381
All right. Good to see you.

226
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,762
Take it easy, man. Good to see you.

227
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,853
Now it's time for the fun part.

228
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,619
What's going on, pal?

229
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,874
What up?

230
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,376
Hey, there he is.

231
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:58,752
-Boom.
-Sober Jackson.

232
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,879
-What's up?
-Hey, hey. Krista's here.

233
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,591
Go on, tell the story.

234
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,174
Dougy, sit down. I'm trying to tell
these motherfuckers about your father.

235
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,180
The Feds will never understand
the guy who's facing 40 years,

236
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,843
Gonna give him the opportunity
to walk soot-free if he gives up his friends.

237
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,104
He tells them,
"Suck a dick. Give me the 40."

238
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,354
"Fucking suck a dick."

239
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,566
Yeah, well, here's to Big Mac.

240
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,731
Doing his time like a man.

241
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,863
-That's right.
-Last crew in Charlestown.

242
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,524
I'm gonna get a tonic, I guess.

243
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,658
All right.
Get me an umbrella for my beer.

244
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:33,287
Let me get a Shirley Temple
with an extra cherry, please.

245
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,616
Poor fucking sober bastard.

246
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,542
-Thanks.
-No problem.

247
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,087
Juice?

248
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,506
Yeah. Juice.

249
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,971
Do you want some snappers
to go with that?

250
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,761
-What are you doing?
-I was just playing,

251
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,725
Fuck.

252
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,728
My drink.

253
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,069
Heard you got in a tight, Kris.

254
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,905
Do I look like I got in a fight?

255
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,196
I don't know. Let me see.
They pull your hoop out?

256
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:16,410
That's right.

257
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,454
The Jamaican started it.

258
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,999
"The Jamaican started it."
What Jamaican?

259
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,256
Fucking Somalian started talking shit
when I was with my daughter.

260
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,883
You were with Shyne?

261
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:32,263
Tonya was with us. And Cheryl too.

262
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,265
-The other girl was by herself?
-Yeah.

263
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,552
All they see are yuppies down here.

264
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,688
They think there's no more serious
white people in Charlestown.

265
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,767
So they can fucking talk shit? No.

266
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,935
You didn't say nothing to her first?

267
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,439
I said something
after I slapped the black off her face.

268
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,233
-Right, yeah.
-Fuck.

269
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,908
Well, do you miss it?

270
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,744
Fucking coke and Oxy
and all that shit? Yeah, I miss it.

271
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,828
You know what I miss?

272
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:05,171
The fucking grip I used to get
on your armrest.

273
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,380
We smoked it to the filter, right?

274
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,466
-So have one beer.
-Jimmy.

275
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:16,098
-One beer ain't gonna kill you, right?
-Drink my beer for me real quick.

276
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,180
-And one for me.
-One for you? Yeah.

277
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,151
Dougy.

278
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,074
Dougy.

279
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,200
Doug.

280
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,330
Motherfucker, I know you can hear me.

281
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,287
You know I got a key, Dougy.

282
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,263
Come on in.

283
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:59,175
Too fucking busy, huh?

284
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,063
Come on, Dougy.

285
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,686
What's up, Kris?

286
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,593
There you go.

287
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,137
That's what you want, right?

288
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,383
-Yeah.
-Is that what you want?

289
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,560
Say you love it.

290
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,395
Good night.

291
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,422
I'm grateful to be here today.

292
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,304
I started out with alcohol,
and, you know, right away...

293
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:26,312
...went to cocaine and smoking crack.

294
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,270
Growing up in Charlestown in,
you know, a small-knit community...

295
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,526
We were protected.

296
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,608
My friends were really
like my family.

297
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,989
I'm ashamed of the things I done
when I'm out there.

298
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,275
I don't know
where I learned these things.

299
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,615
Seven years went by,
and I'd watch Christmas, birthdays--

300
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,530
I didn't know what my son looked like.

301
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,699
Make a fast buck if we had to...

302
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:51,212
...that progressed
into getting arrested, and ....

303
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,091
The struggle that you have within yourself
the loss, you know what I mean?

304
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:59,299
The disappointment in yourself The anger
that turns into disappointment. The despair

305
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,305
It's like the guy sitting in the bar,
and a priest walks in.

306
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,011
The guy says, "Hey, wait a minute.

307
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:08,395
I hate to tell you this, don't waste your
time, but I happen to know there's no God."

308
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,227
The priest says, "Yeah, how's that?"

309
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,734
The guy says,
"I was an explorer in the North Pole.

310
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:17,318
I got caught in a blinding storm once.
Freezing. I was blinded.

311
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:21,109
Freezing to death. And I prayed,
'If there's a God, save me now'

312
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,777
Now, God didn't come."

313
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:26,664
And the priest says, you know, "How's
that? You're alive. He must've saved you."

314
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,324
He says, "God never showed up.

315
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,495
An Eskimo came along,
took me back to his camp and saved me."

316
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,710
That's Janice. She's my wife
and she's sitting right there.

317
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,796
She's my Eskimo.

318
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,058
-How you doing?
-Hey.

319
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:03,919
Excuse me?

320
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,343
Are you doing laundry?

321
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:08,970
Huh?

322
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,932
I just wondered if you had any change.
The machine is out.

323
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:15,894
-Can't help you. Sorry.
-Okay.

324
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,772
I can just hang them up
when I get home.

325
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,384
You all right?

326
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,227
I'm fine. I'm just--

327
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,013
Are you sure?

328
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:01,481
You okay?

329
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:05,531
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine, thank you.
I'm fine, yeah.

330
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,441
Well, this is embarrassing.

331
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:10,077
No, you got nothing
to be embarrassed for.

332
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:13,864
Do you need help?

333
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,542
I'm just having a bad week.

334
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,500
I understand.

335
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,042
I like to have a good cry
at the nail salon.

336
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:30,723
Just open right up to the ladies.
They're very understanding.

337
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:34,010
But, you know,
you like the Laundromat, so that's fine.

338
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:44,487
Hey, why don't you let me
buy you a drink.

339
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:47,114
Make up for letting you down
with the quarters.

340
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,866
You know, see if we can turn
your week around.

341
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,699
What's the worst that could happen?

342
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,158
FBI! Open the door

343
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:55,740
Open the door!

344
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,710
Fuck.

345
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,046
Fuck.

346
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,211
Fucking cocksucker. Get off him.

347
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:23,901
Jesus Christ, Henry.

348
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,771
Oxy, guns?

349
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,190
It's like townie Christmas.

350
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:35,781
Minimum federal sentencing,
10 years.

351
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:39,826
You're gonna need a friend.

352
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,753
And she ain't it.

353
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:48,422
Great girl, though.
She really loves you, I can tell.

354
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,554
Good news for you is you have an alibi
for the Cambridge job.

355
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:56,468
The good news for me
is I bet you know something about it.

356
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,937
Everyone does trucks.

357
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,849
These guys beat the alarm
for the vault.

358
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,066
-Yeah?
-It's what I heard.

359
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,946
A kid, he gets into the junction box.

360
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,948
-This is nice.
-Yeah, it's a good place.

361
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:23,460
A guy I played hockey with for a long time
is one of the managers here.

362
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,463
Oh, yeah? That's nice.

363
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,174
So, what do you do for work?

364
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,423
Boston Sand and Gravel.

365
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:35,590
I break rocks.
Punch a ticket at the end of the day...

366
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,635
...slide down the back of a brontosaurus
like Fred Flintstone.

367
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,892
Call it a night.

368
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,143
-Can I ask you something?
-You sure can.

369
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,774
I volunteer at the Boys & Girls Club
in Charlestown--

370
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,105
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

371
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:51,192
As a kickball pitcher since they haven't
been able to afford any ice for the rink.

372
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:54,029
Embarrassing, City won't put
any money into that place.

373
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:57,991
Yeah, I know. Yeah, well, some of the kids
were calling me a toonie?

374
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:02,158
It just means a yuppie. Someone who's
not from Charlestown, that's all.

375
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,498
-Of course it does.
-They're just being punks.

376
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:06,708
-A yuppie.
-Yeah.

377
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,215
-So where does the word come from?
-Uh ....

378
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,376
It comes from back in the '90s, like...

379
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,136
...the toonies supplied all the tunes
to Charlestown."

380
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:19,175
...because once they moved in
the townies stole all their car stereos.

381
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:21,719
So all of a sudden,
everyone in Charlestown...

382
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:25,185
...had a Blaupunkt in their car,
you know what I mean?

383
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:26,894
Anyway.

384
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,478
So do your parents still live
in Charlestown?

385
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,480
No. My mother moved away.

386
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:37,527
My father lives out in the suburbs.

387
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,531
Yeah. He don't get out much.

388
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,084
-No, I mean where did you grow up?
-Marblehead.

389
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,044
Marblehead?

390
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,542
Wow.

391
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:52,128
Yeah, well,
I represent Marblehead's poor.

392
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,669
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, you were defined by...

393
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:59,887
...whether or not your family owned a boat.
And, well, my family didn't own a boat.

394
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:03,643
No boat. How could you
look yourself in the mirror?

395
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,475
It's embarrassing.

396
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:08,641
-I have a boat.
-Oh, yeah?

397
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,401
-Yeah.
-Well, you would do well in Marblehead.

398
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,235
Yeah, maybe. It's not my boat,
it's my friend's boat.

399
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,612
You should...

400
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,368
...let me take you for a ride sometime.

401
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,831
-I'd love that. Sometime.
-Yeah.

402
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,494
What about right now?

403
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,515
That's the boat. Right there.

404
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:46,554
Wow,

405
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:50,437
-Not bad, right?
-Good friends to have.

406
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:13,331
Here you go.
It's the best cup I could find.

407
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,333
Not too much.

408
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,173
Thank you.

409
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,803
It's nice, right? I told you.

410
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,309
Is this where you take all the girls?

411
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:31,482
I can honestly tell you I have never taken
another girl here in my entire life.

412
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,234
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hm. That's the truth.

413
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,820
Hey, what do you know about
bank robbers?

414
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,822
-What's to know?
-You're from Charlestown.

415
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,082
I figured you grew up with some of them.

416
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,877
No, not really. I mean ....

417
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:55,669
A lot of what they say is exaggerated.
I mean, I--

418
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,467
When I was a kid, uh...

419
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,422
...we used to go to Wizard's ice cream.

420
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,841
It was across from J.J.'s Bar.

421
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,806
That was where all the big
armored-car guys hung out.

422
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:12,314
And they were like rock stars
in the neighborhood, you know?

423
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:15,646
Fancy cars. Pretty girls.

424
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:21,407
And you heard rumors
about the jobs they pulled.

425
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:25,866
The big houses they had
in Holbrook or Winthrop.

426
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,914
There was a lot of kids
in the ice-cream shop...

427
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,668
...with their noses pressed
against the glass, you know...

428
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:37,422
...who wanted to be like those guys.

429
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,881
I just wanted to play hockey.

430
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:49,518
Anyway, that's what I know
about bank robbers.

431
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:59,148
-Hey, Jem. How's it going?
-Hey, B. Can I have a beer? Thanks.

432
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,403
-Oh, shit.
-What up?

433
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:04,032
-How you doing?
-All right. Sox got rocked.

434
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,244
What's going on?

435
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,788
You, uh, check on that thing?

436
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,076
What?

437
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,371
The license.

438
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,382
-Yeah.
-And?

439
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,590
Nothing. It's a dead end, We're all set.

440
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:28,006
So no need to remove her
from the equation?

441
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,594
-What?
-You heard me.

442
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,809
What are you, a triggerman now?

443
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,099
Just loose ends, kid.

444
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,278
You're gonna get the fucking electric
chair brought back over to Charlestown.

445
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,781
Don't be so goddamned panicked,
all right, Dig Dug?

446
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,114
Just, you know, I don't wanna get
backdoored, that's all.

447
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,155
-We're fine. All right?
-All right. We're fine.

448
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,619
-Okay.
-We're fine.

449
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,211
They obviously know
how to work the box.

450
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,420
But I like the way they zapped the BPT
to the D-5 station.

451
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,710
How does one learn how to do that?

452
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,925
Get a job at Vericom.

453
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:10,716
-Okay.
-Thank you.

454
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,602
All right, let's subpoena work logs,
employee records.

455
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,763
Start with everybody
who lives in the town.

456
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,352
Go! it.

457
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:26,527
Ms. Keesey, it's Agent Frawley.
I have follow-up questions about your case.

458
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,784
Is there somewhere we can meet?

459
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:32,287
Why didn't you tell me
you lived in Charlestown?

460
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,662
It's on my paperwork.

461
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,331
You don't like your sandwich?

462
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:47,177
It's the unfortunate nagging suspicion
you get as an FBI agent..

463
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,555
...who has put a lot of neighborhood
people in federal prison...

464
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:54,389
...that someone may have
violated your meal.

465
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:57,020
Come on, I don't think
anyone would do that.

466
00:34:57,178 --> 00:35:00,398
They throw Tom Fitz off the roof
of Mishawum for cooperating...

467
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:04,061
...and then stand around and taunt him
while he drowned in his own blood.

468
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,022
So I don't think the lunch special
is out of bounds.

469
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,156
Okay.

470
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:12,322
They lionize criminals...

471
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,533
...and complain about crime...

472
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,198
...and I'm the bad guy.

473
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:20,828
This place is one square mile.

474
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:24,464
You walk into Lewisburg,
there's a hundred townies in there.

475
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:26,875
Well, I think I'll skip Lewisburg.

476
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,262
Doesn't sound like a fun second date?

477
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:36,013
If I ask a question,
will you give an honest answer?

478
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,227
It depends on the question.

479
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,647
Am I a suspect?

480
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,896
Would I ask you out
if I thought you were a suspect?

481
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,902
I don't know.

482
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,068
-Would you?
-Not if I wanted a conviction.

483
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,032
I might be seeing someone already.

484
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,455
-What? What is it?
-Stickup.

485
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,798
Chelsea Credit Union.

486
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,050
What would we do without Chelsea?

487
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,343
Anyway, aren't there rules?

488
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,096
Against dating the Vic?
Yeah, there's a rule.

489
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,931
You don't do it.

490
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,359
-There she is.
-Hey.

491
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:29,021
-All set?
-Yes,

492
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,029
I should have come
get your door for you, huh?

493
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,116
What kind of a guy lets you open
your own door like that?

494
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,699
What?

495
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,535
I have to get something out there...

496
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:47,172
...otherwise I'll be pretending
to listen to you all night...

497
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,833
...when really I'm thinking about
something else.

498
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:52,298
Okay.

499
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,469
A few days ago my bank was robbed.

500
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:01,182
Four men took it over
and opened the safe.

501
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,643
They took me as a hostage.

502
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:09,065
They blindfolded me
and drove me around.

503
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:14,366
And then they stopped and let me out
over at the beach and ....

504
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,029
And one of the guys told me...

505
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:23,000
...to walk until I felt the water
on my toes.

506
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:28,289
It was the longest walk of my life.
I kept thinking I'd step off a cliff.

507
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,928
And then I felt the water.

508
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,674
I'm sorry.

509
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,598
It's not your fault.

510
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:48,684
Anyway, the FBI guy told me
it would feel like I was in mourning.

511
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,979
FBI? You're working with the FBI?

512
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:53,567
Mm-hm.

513
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,237
What does that mean?

514
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:59,737
Guy comes by, checks in on you,
gives you a call? That kind of thing?

515
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,908
Pretty much.

516
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:06,285
They don't have any suspects?
Any clues? Any leads? Anything like that?

517
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,045
I don't know.
Not that they've told me.

518
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:12,048
He intimated that they were
scouring Charlestown...

519
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:16,719
...but they were wearing masks, so....

520
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:19,715
-Shit.
-Mm.

521
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:24,516
I'm sure I'd recognize their voices
if I heard them again.

522
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,895
I don't know,
might be harder than you think.

523
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,859
At least you weren't hurt.

524
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,363
No.

525
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:37,566
No, but David was.

526
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:41,862
My assistant manager, he was assaulted
really badly when the alarm went off.

527
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,656
He's been at Mass Eye and Ear
for a week.

528
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,416
Eye surgery.

529
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,665
And I still haven't been able
to go see him.

530
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,839
I feel like a terrible person.

531
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:57,177
Then I guess we know
where we're going.

532
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,274
Well, you should come in.

533
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:15,320
-Yeah?
-Yeah, you should meet him.

534
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,359
All right.

535
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,774
-Hi.
-Hello. Hi.

536
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,820
Oh, hi. Come to my good side.

537
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,579
-Hi.
-Look. You don't look so bad.

538
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,490
-Really?
-Well, you know.

539
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:28,954
-Hello.
-Hey.

540
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,836
-This is my friend Doug.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

541
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,872
Nice to meet you. I can almost see you.

542
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,381
So...

543
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,795
...they're hopeful.

544
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,632
Well, "hopeful" means I may recover...

545
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,172
...50 percent of my sight in this eye.

546
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,133
Oh, I just want to get back to work.

547
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,474
I'm gonna give you guys some privacy.
I'll be right outside.

548
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,894
-You heard what happened?
-Huh?

549
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:58,564
Big takedown robbery.

550
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:02,192
-Fucking punks laid the guy out.
-Oh, yeah?

551
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,413
It's a good thing you're here.

552
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,078
Those guys could come back.

553
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,334
Yeah.

554
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,957
I lied to the FBI.

555
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,709
What?

556
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,582
When the guy attacked David...

557
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:20,343
...I could see the back of his neck
and he had a tattoo.

558
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,842
Of what?

559
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:27,471
It was one of those
Fighting Irish tattoos.

560
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:30,183
I'm afraid if I report it
they'll make me testify.

561
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,689
What do you think I should do?

562
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,357
Tell the FBI.

563
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:42,699
If the guy's got a record,
and I'm sure he does...

564
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,485
...they'll have his tattoos on tile.

565
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,950
They'll ring him up the next day.

566
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,116
Robbery, weapons. He'll get 30 years.

567
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,832
Course, they'll worry someone's
gonna come looking for the witness.

568
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,874
The FBI will probably want to put you in
WITSEC, you know, Witness Security.

569
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,090
You know, they'll probably put you
somewhere, like, you know, in Cleveland...

570
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,471
...or Arizona, you know,
somewhere safe.

571
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,137
Or...

572
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,265
...you could wait.

573
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,223
You have a card.

574
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,401
There's nothing says you gotta play it
right away.

575
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,688
You're the one who's vulnerable
in this situation right now.

576
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,695
The FBI are just people
like anyone else.

577
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,861
They wanna find the bad guy so they
can go home and nuke their supper.

578
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:31,076
You have to look out
for yourself, Claire.

579
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,701
Quite an expert.

580
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,250
Not really.

581
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,086
Just watch a lot of TV.

582
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,968
I watch a lot of CSI.

583
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:47,131
So I'm a really big expert
on all this. I know.

584
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:50,721
And Miami CSI and New York CSI.

585
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,760
All of them, I watch.

586
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,270
You'll be well-prepared.

587
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:55,806
And Bones.

588
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:04,986
Do we know each other well enough for
me to say that this truck is a little much?

589
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:06,274
It's my work truck.

590
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:09,615
If you have problems with your Prius
I can throw it in the back.

591
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,779
How did you know I had a Prius?

592
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:17,786
Took a guess.
I mean, it just seemed like a toonie car.

593
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,795
-Why, do you really have a Prius?
-Yeah.

594
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,332
-Really?
-I had a Prius.

595
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,502
-It got vandalized, of course.
-What happened?

596
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:29,047
Doesn't matter. Now I'm forced to walk
a mile through the projects.

597
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:32,592
-There were these guys and they started ....
-What?

598
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:35,638
I'm not sure if it was the same guys
who trashed my car, but--

599
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:39,307
They started getting, you know--
it started with yelling when I walked by...

600
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,693
...and then it got
really aggressive and ....

601
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:43,068
What were they doing?

602
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,400
Once glass bottles
started getting thrown...

603
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:49,488
...I started coming to terms with not being
cool enough to walk through the projects.

604
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,493
They threw bottles at you?

605
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:55,247
I’m fine. I just have to, you know,
go the long way.

606
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,579
That's all. It doesn't matter.

607
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:00,291
No. You just have to live with it,
I guess.

608
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,373
You remember what they look like?

609
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:11,006
I need your help.
I can't tell you what it is...

610
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:14,722
...you can never ask me about it later,
and we're gonna hurt some people.

611
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,687
Whose car are we gonna take?

612
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,363
Kenny with the white nose.

613
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,905
-Hey, what's good, man?
-Hey.

614
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:34,662
-How you doing?
-I hope you here to buy something.

615
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:37,700
You roll up on a nigga,
"Kenny with the white nose" like that.

616
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,867
Well, we ain't here to play fucking Xbox.

617
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,708
-Yeah.
-Wanna buy some dope, Kenny.

618
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,838
-Cheap, shitty dope.
-Yeah? Okay.

619
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,216
-He sells no other kind.
-Let me go find my box.

620
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,753
-I'll be right back, okay?
-Appreciate it.

621
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,927
Kenny.

622
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:56,555
We're in Charlestown.

623
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,060
Worst heroin problem on the East Coast.
Nigga Ken can't find his box.

624
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,017
You ever buy from this clown before?

625
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,858
I bought drugs from
electrician Marty with the white nose.

626
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,067
All right.

627
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:15,328
Yeah, here we go.
I got just what you need, brother.

628
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,573
-All right, here.
-All right. Looks good to me, baby.

629
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,412
-Thanks, partner.
-Yes, sir.

630
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,581
Hey, um...

631
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:26,464
...you know them Dominican kids
always starting trouble on Medford Street?

632
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:27,874
Know what unit they're in?

633
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:44,144
Townie credit card.

634
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:09,465
-Who is it?
-Open up.

635
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:16,555
What the--'?

636
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,985
You drinking beers up here, huh? You--

637
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,486
That hurts, right? Fucking piece of shit.

638
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:40,955
Huh?

639
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:45,289
Throw with your left?

640
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,582
-Fuck!
-Oh, shit, that hurts, huh?

641
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,172
-What the fuck?
-That's a bitch, ain't it?

642
00:45:56,379 --> 00:46:00,680
Deal gone south for you motherfuckers.

643
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,559
-Too bad.
-Who the fuck are you?

644
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:07,182
Shouldn't be up here
fucking selling dope, I guess.

645
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,226
Listen to me,
we're coming back in a week.

646
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,650
-If you're fucking here then...
-Oh, shit.

647
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:15,941
...this is happening again.

648
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:20,115
Let's go, we're done.

649
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,288
Hey.

650
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:26,538
-What'd you do?
-I don't know what you're talking about.

651
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:28,669
That's my brother.
What'd you do to him?

652
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:30,671
I don't know what you're talking about.

653
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,049
-You don't know? How about now?
-No.

654
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,505
Hey, chill, chill, chill, man. Chill.
Chill, man.

655
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,045
Don't tell me to chill.

656
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,838
-Enough. Let's go.
-What'd you do?

657
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:40,882
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-No?

658
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:46,145
Soccer. There goes college soccer,
motherfucker.

659
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,773
-Fuck!
-What'd you do?

660
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,104
-No?
-I don't know. Aah!

661
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,527
See my face?

662
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,901
Go tell the cops, all right?

663
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:59,067
But just remember, I seen yours too.

664
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,076
Fuck.

665
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:15,462
I can't be up there
killing people, man.

666
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:18,090
Hey, you brought me.

667
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,601
Desmond Elden?

668
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:32,643
Yeah, works for Vericom.
Never seen the inside of a jail cell.

669
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:35,482
Most of these guys got no-show jobs.
Take down a truck...

670
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:39,194
...foreman goes, "Yeah, guy was here
yesterday." He shows us a forged timecard.

671
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:42,281
Can't play them games at Vericom
because it's a public company.

672
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,445
You don't show up,
it's a recorded sick day.

673
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:47,240
And Dezzy here,
he's got some interesting sick days.

674
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:53,504
BankBoston, Cummins Armored,
Arlington Brinks, Cambridge Merchants.

675
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,970
Jesus Christ.

676
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:08,098
So do your parents
still live in Charlestown?

677
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,640
No, my father finally
made it out to the suburbs,

678
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,692
What about your mother?

679
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:18,066
I couldn't tell you.
She left when I was 6.

680
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,817
What happened?

681
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,744
She left.

682
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,661
Okay.

683
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,675
Okay.

684
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,349
This sound woke me up.

685
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,937
At first I didn't know what it was.

686
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:56,104
Sounded like an animal
that got trapped.

687
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:01,363
I never heard a man cry before.

688
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,114
I came downstairs in my underwear.

689
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:09,872
I see my father in the kitchen.

690
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,617
First thing I remember was the ashtray.

691
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,252
Must have been a hundred cigarettes
in there.

692
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,914
Ash like a little mountain.

693
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,334
He stopped crying...

694
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:25,088
...was just sitting there watching TV
on a little black-and-white.

695
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:26,927
No sound.

696
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:31,932
I think he just didn't know
what else to do.

697
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,560
He looked at me standing there
in the doorway in my Underoos.

698
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:45,233
He said, "Your mother left.
She's not coming back."

699
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:49,745
Just like that.

700
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:55,706
Smoking cigarettes and eating
a TV dinner at 6 in the morning.

701
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:02,253
We lost our dog the year before...

702
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,512
...and I wanted to make these posters...

703
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,391
...in case my mother was lost...

704
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,393
...someone could call us...

705
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:16,226
...like the guy who found our dog.

706
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:22,354
To this day my father will tell you he helped
me make them posters, but he didn't.

707
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,400
Sat in the kitchen, drank a case of beer
while I went out on School Street...

708
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:29,284
...asking people
if they'd seen my mother.

709
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,616
Her name was Doris.

710
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:36,956
My grandmother had a place
that's a restaurant in Tangerine, Florida.

711
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,996
So I used to imagine
maybe that's where she went.

712
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:46,962
Then I came to terms with the fact
that doesn't really matter, you know?

713
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:51,717
Wherever she went,
she had a good reason to leave here.

714
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:55,685
She didn't wanna be
my mother anymore...

715
00:50:56,178 --> 00:51:00,354
...and she wasn't coming back.

716
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:06,314
And now you know a little bit
about my family...

717
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:09,192
...but I'm still not showing you
my apartment.

718
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:13,162
How bad can it be?

719
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,920
Oh, yeah.

720
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,398
Desmond Elden.

721
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:46,279
Systems tech at Vericom,
22 years old.

722
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:50,195
Albert Magloan. Only in Boston
is a guy named Albert Magloan.

723
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,702
Mr. Magloan never met a car
he couldn't boost.

724
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,704
The kind of talented individual...

725
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:59,618
...that can start your Cherokee for you
while you’re still looking for your keys.

726
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:03,913
James Coughlin. Father was killed
in prison, mother died of HIV.

727
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,583
Shot Brendan Leahey by the cemetery
behind Mishawum when he was 18.

728
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:11,755
Pled it out. When the judge asked him why
he did it, he said, "I didn't like the kid."

729
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,014
Served nine years for manslaughter.

730
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:17,894
These guys plan and execute
with sophistication and discipline.

731
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:20,555
And that is not our boy Coughlin.

732
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:25,226
We think the architect is this guy,
Coughlin's best friend, Doug MacRay.

733
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,736
Lives in the same house,
dated Coughlin's sister...

734
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:32,446
...who most likely mules for the Florist,
who used to employ MacRay's father.

735
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:34,986
You need a fucking Venn diagram
for these people.

736
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:40,579
Mac Sr. got life for the Nashua job,
which most of you should remember.

737
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:42,835
Hijacked a bread truck
up to New Hampshire...

738
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:45,291
...one of the guards saw his face...

739
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:48,128
...so they executed both of them
with their own weapons.

740
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,794
Big Mads legacy is now no A car driver
is allowed to leave the cab...

741
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,133
...even if there's a gun
to his partner's head.

742
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:57,425
MacRay did eight months
for going over the counter at a BayBank...

743
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,593
...with a nail gun
after he washed out from pro hockey.

744
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,434
-Pro hockey?
-Yeah, he was a big deal for a minute.

745
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,099
Got drafted, went to camp,
and here's the shocker:

746
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:07,313
Started making trouble,
fighting with guys.

747
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:10,780
-Don't they pay you to fight in hockey?
-No, not the guys on your own team.

748
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,533
MacRay came home,
got into the family business.

749
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,277
Same song, got into OxyContin.

750
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:19,621
Hockey ship sailed with the narcotics.

751
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:22,249
Now, we are a long way away
from a grand jury here.

752
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:24,285
We'll never get 24-hour surveillance...

753
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:27,045
...unless one of these idiots converts
to Islam.

754
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,047
So we build the case.

755
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,712
All right, let's get to work.

756
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:35,429
So I've been telling all my friends
about you.

757
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,635
-Oh, yeah? All good, I hope.
-Yeah.

758
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:40,142
Eh.

759
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:44,476
Oh, yeah.
They say they're overcome with jealousy.

760
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,016
They can't believe your luck.

761
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:51,813
You moved to Charlestown,
hooked up with a rock-breaking townie.

762
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:54,861
No.

763
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:58,987
They just think it's a rebound.

764
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:00,996
A rebound from what, the robbery?

765
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:02,657
I don't know.

766
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:05,827
I feel estranged from them somehow.

767
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,790
What? Why do you look like that?

768
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:16,387
-My brother died on a day like this.
-When was this?

769
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:20,140
He was little. He had lymphoma.

770
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:25,892
So now on really sunny days
I always think of someone dying.

771
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,275
That's wrong, isn't it?

772
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:32,854
No.

773
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,023
I'm sure he'd be glad
you're thinking about him.

774
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,452
This is a good day.

775
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:42,705
I'm having a good time.

776
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:44,365
Good.

777
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,451
Then you'll miss me while I'm gone.

778
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,806
Money, bitch.

779
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,434
Pop.

780
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:12,605
What the fuck you doing here? Huh?

781
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:14,395
-Nothing.
-Nothing? What's this?

782
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,188
-Who are you here with, huh?
-No one.

783
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:18,983
-Let's get out of here.
-You're telling me this is yours?

784
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,822
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Fucking Hawaiian pizza?

785
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,577
-Sit down.
-Let's hit the road.

786
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:25,159
-I gotta go.
-Sit the fuck down. Just sit down.

787
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,590
-Hi.
-Hi.

788
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:41,760
-Hey.
-Claire.

789
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:43,094
-I'm Jem.
-Jim?

790
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:44,759
Jem. Jem. It's just Jem, yeah.

791
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:46,768
I'm a friend of this loser right here.

792
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:50,397
-Nice to meet you.
-Sit down, sit down, relax. All right?

793
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:02,239
So I saw your fucking Avalanche
parked around the corner, so ....

794
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:03,527
The Avalanche?

795
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:06,447
-Truck.
-Fucking truck. His work truck right there.

796
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:10,451
-Dougy's quite the worker.
-Yeah.

797
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,790
Have you two known each other
a longtime or...?

798
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:16,628
Since we were 6.
We're like brothers. Right?

799
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:19,635
But he's never mentioned a word
about you.

800
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:22,467
The secrets with this one, you know, huh?

801
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:29,310
Did you say your name was Jim
or Jem?

802
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:32,769
It's Ji--Je--
Well, it's both, actually.

803
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:35,525
Teachers, when we were growing up,
used to always say:

804
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:38,153
"Hey, you can have this one.
He's a real gem."

805
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,647
So I guess it kind of stuck.

806
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:44,485
Whatever. I don't know.

807
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,779
So, what do you do
for yourself there, Claire?

808
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,822
Oh, I work at a bank.
I'm a bank manager.

809
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:51,583
You're a bank manager?
Sounds fun. What bank?

810
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:54,878
Cambridge Merchants. Just over there.

811
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:58,541
Cambridge Merchants. Wait, that's the one
that just got robbed, isn't it?

812
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:00,459
It got robbed, yeah. It did, yeah.

813
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:04,051
I read about that. It's crazy.

814
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,219
So then how is it that you two met?

815
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,507
Um ....

816
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,428
We met at a Laundromat.

817
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,725
Okay.

818
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:14,390
Love among the bleach, right?

819
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,354
Hey, it happens more than you think.

820
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:25,446
Hey, Claire, don't get too used
to your life of leisure here.

821
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:28,738
Dougy here, he's a real workaholic,
you know.

822
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:31,373
He's always taking his work home
with him.

823
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,033
Aren't you?

824
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,378
-All right.
-All right, brother.

825
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:40,086
Take care of yourself, all right?
Be good.

826
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:42,376
I'll see you at home.
It was nice to meet you.

827
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:43,885
You too.

828
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:53,562
Well, I guess you haven't been telling
all your friends about me.

829
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,029
Who you following, Jem?
Me or her?

830
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,361
I told you, I made the Avalanche.

831
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:09,077
Nothing to worry about.
It's all under control.

832
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:11,204
Oh, so you're trying to get us
jammed up?

833
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:13,582
-Is that it?
-I'm trying to get you jammed up.

834
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:16,877
Tell me you got a move here, Dougy.

835
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:20,881
Because the only way I see it is you
got sprung like a goddamn bear trap...

836
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:25,169
...on some toonie pussy who happens
to be the one goddamn person--Fuck!

837
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:28,464
The one person that can give us
to the fucking Feds.

838
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:34,599
Calm down, all right?

839
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:37,143
Don't you think we need to be smart
right now?

840
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,353
-Smart?
-Yeah.

841
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,065
Let's start fucking all the witnesses.
All right?

842
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:47,449
Yeah, I'm blowing the assistant manager.
Am I smart now? Huh?

843
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:51,862
And no, I didn't tell the other guys,
only because they'd flip the fuck out.

844
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,490
And I want them fucking ready
for the next thing.

845
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,784
I told you, the next fucking thing's
not ready.

846
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,122
Then make it ready.

847
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:02,040
I don't like the guards
on the next thing, all right?

848
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,503
One kid is like fucking G.l. Joe.

849
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:08,967
He wears the vest on the outside, tucks
his pants into his fucking combat boots.

850
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:10,881
The truck's fucking waist-high.

851
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:13,801
We'll end another truck
with a driver...

852
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,811
...who's a fucking fat kid
with his fucking shit untucked...

853
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:20,065
-...who don't think he's Special Forces.
-Yeah?

854
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:23,147
All right, look, I know you're
happy in Fuck City over there...

855
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:26,063
...but I waited nine years in Walpole
for you, motherfucker.

856
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,448
Just nine years, that's all.

857
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:31,735
I'm done waiting.

858
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:36,498
This is the last one.
We're hitting pause after this.

859
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:40,123
You hate prison
but you can't wait to get caught.

860
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:43,755
We get pinched,
remember whose idea this was, okay?

861
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,875
Be ready on Friday.

862
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:04,393
Visitors, straight ahead.

863
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:37,347
-Who you seeing?
-Stephen MacRay.

864
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,569
Twelve.

865
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,409
-Right down there.
-Thanks, Lenny.

866
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:22,855
You all right? Every time I come up
here now it's the red pajamas.

867
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,061
You still getting in trouble, Dad?

868
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:29,273
Hey, you know how it is.
Can't take no shit.

869
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:32,155
You're getting a little old
for that bullshit, aren't you?

870
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:34,942
Fucking Southie kids.
They wanna run everything.

871
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:38,612
Listen, you put a year together of
good behavior and get your points down...

872
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,997
...you get classed out
over to Norfolk, Dad.

873
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:44,160
No one's gonna bother you there.
Nobody fights, you know?

874
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:47,125
They got fucking Ben & Jerry's
ice cream and shit.

875
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:51,508
Well, some things you gotta deal with
yourself, you know?

876
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:57,548
All right.

877
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:08,563
I'm thinking about taking a trip.

878
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:11,895
-Going dark for a minute.
-Taking heat?

879
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:15,107
Nah, just making a change.

880
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:16,991
Yeah, don't tell me.

881
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,493
"Making a change."

882
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:21,280
Either you got heat or you don't.

883
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,371
I heard a bread truck got dropped.

884
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:28,003
Oh, yeah? I didn't hear about it.

885
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,163
Okay.

886
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:34,176
You got five minutes. Five minutes.

887
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:36,841
Let me ask you something.

888
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:39,006
In case I don't see you again.

889
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,723
How come you never...?

890
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:47,855
How come you never looked for her?

891
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,560
Uh ....

892
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:53,650
Looked for who?

893
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:57,532
For Ma.

894
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:01,115
For my mother.
How come you never looked for her?

895
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:04,532
How come you never tried to call nobody
or look for her, or ask around?

896
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:06,917
Look, when your mother left...

897
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:12,373
...you cried so hard you were throwing up.
All over the parlor.

898
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:16,801
So I told you if you looked around
you might find her.

899
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,088
Just to give you an activity.

900
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:22,508
I didn't think you'd carry it
like a fucking disease.

901
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:27,220
What, you wanna think
she was an angel?

902
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:29,272
Go ahead.

903
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:32,317
But look out your front door.

904
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:35,194
How many 22-year-old girls
are out there...

905
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:39,779
...they're fucking around
with kids they don't want...

906
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:44,242
...and, you know,
no sense in their heads.

907
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:48,245
And your mother wasn't no different.

908
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:50,502
That's the hard truth.

909
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:54,964
I made my peace with it.
You make yours.

910
01:03:55,457 --> 01:04:00,088
I didn't look for her
because there was nothing to find.

911
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:13,104
Look, I gotta die five times
before I get out of here...

912
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:16,816
...but I'll see you again.

913
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:19,857
This side or the other.

914
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:55,400
So I saw your picture yesterday.

915
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:01,156
-Are you sure it was me?
-Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

916
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:05,235
-Oh, the Boys & Girls Club?
-Yeah.

917
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,496
It was under a "local heroes" banner.

918
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:11,033
Yeah. They got a real low standard
for who qualities on that.

919
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:13,038
Apparently you were drafted.

920
01:05:13,201 --> 01:05:18,879
Yeah. I was slow.
And I couldn't skate backwards.

921
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:22,169
You're supposed to be able to skate
backwards in pro hockey.

922
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:26,841
But I could shoot, you know?
I could hit anything with a hockey puck.

923
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:32,604
But I got drafted and I just didn't do
what it took to make the team.

924
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:37,393
And when I got a second chance,
I blew that too.

925
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:42,189
They sent me home and that was it.

926
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:44,778
I look at that picture
and I see a 20-year-old kid...

927
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,694
...who thinks he's, you know,
got it all figured out.

928
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:52,617
Right before he's about
to throw it all away.

929
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:06,547
Hey, I don't wanna rush anything,
but can we go into your room?

930
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:09,557
Because my uncle the bus driver
lives right across the way...

931
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:12,515
...and he can see
right into this apartment.

932
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:16,348
-Yes.
-Okay.

933
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:54,848
They win the game
in overtime. Then you flip it over.

934
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,604
Then you go back to Fenway Park.

935
01:06:56,763 --> 01:06:59,516
Then you get another great ending
to another ....

936
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,162
--19, we walked through.

937
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,743
Nothing appears disturbed.

938
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:00,126
In this apartment anyway.

939
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:01,958
Where the fuck's the truck?

940
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:05,006
We shut and locked the door but...

941
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:07,667
-What happened to 08:45?
-Late is what happened.

942
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:09,381
Fucking douche bag.

943
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:35,408
Say your prayers. Here we go.

944
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:40,412
Here we go.

945
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:00,053
Gun!

946
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:03,102
Don't move!

947
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:10,070
-Go! Go!
-Get back! Get back!

948
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:12,231
Get out of the way!

949
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:24,585
Any units In the area, 10-61 In progress.

950
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:26,087
The call went out!

951
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,665
Fuck.

952
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,588
Get out here, asshole,
I got your friend.

953
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:34,883
Calm down. Put your gun away,
all right? You're gonna get hurt.

954
01:09:35,046 --> 01:09:37,595
Put that fucking gun down now.
I got you, motherfucker.

955
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,510
Jesus!

956
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:44,480
You should have stayed in the truck, cunt.

957
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:46,099
Let's go!

958
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:49,561
What the fuck just happened?

959
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:53,197
-Goddamn it, I fucking told you.
-Fucking shut the fuck up, all right?

960
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:54,903
-Fucking knew it.
-Goddamn it!

961
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:59,988
All right, drive. Just take it easy, all
right? Take it easy. Drive slow. Drive normal.

962
01:10:03,491 --> 01:10:04,788
-Shit.
-Ah, fuck.

963
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:08,417
They must have been around the corner.

964
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:51,880
Driver, turn your engine off.

965
01:10:52,457 --> 01:10:54,710
Hands where I can see them.

966
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:56,965
Fuck.

967
01:10:57,128 --> 01:11:00,348
Shut the engine off now.
Put your hands in the a--

968
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:10,525
Hit the engine block!

969
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:14,153
Go, go, go, go, go!

970
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:39,963
Go to the fucking switch!

971
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:49,856
Fuck!

972
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:59,445
How do you like that, motherfucker?

973
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,629
Let's go, let's go!

974
01:12:13,788 --> 01:12:15,415
-It's Dez.
-Let's go, let's go!

975
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:16,878
Drop it!

976
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:30,392
Let's go!

977
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:49,703
Dino.

978
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,163
What?

979
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:52,834
Close the bridge.

980
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:57,040
-What?
-Close the fucking bridge.

981
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:17,815
Alpha 101, Alpha 412, Alpha 407...

982
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:20,150
...en route to the north end
of the bridge.

983
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:22,486
They're going for the bridge.

984
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:04,524
Now, that's how you drive
a fucking car.

985
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:22,962
All the DNA in Charlestown.

986
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:50,407
The fuck was that?

987
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:53,618
He didn't wanna end up on the wall
at the VFW.

988
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:01,080
You print the inside of the van?

989
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,420
Frawl, the inside of the van
is a volcano.

990
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:07,257
Just find something and make it look
like something that looks like a print.

991
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:10,423
We don't have enough
for a conviction. Fine.

992
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,592
But I need to get them in a room.

993
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,145
Right now, they are burning the money
bands at some bullshit safe house.

994
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:19,147
All their alibis were paid for
a week in advance,

995
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:22,522
We're not gonna pull any DNA
off of this or off the switch car.

996
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:26,030
And that, as they say, is that.

997
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:30,614
This is the "not fucking around" crew.
Find me something that looks like a print...

998
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:33,529
...so I can grab one of these assholes
and shake their tree.

999
01:15:33,696 --> 01:15:36,324
This "not fucking around" thing
is about to go both ways.

1000
01:15:58,421 --> 01:16:00,173
Turn around for me, will you?

1001
01:16:15,312 --> 01:16:17,940
-Mr. Coughlin.
-Lawyer.

1002
01:16:25,489 --> 01:16:29,289
-This is it? Just say what's here?
-Yeah, go ahead. Read what's on the paper.

1003
01:16:29,452 --> 01:16:30,704
All right.

1004
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:35,091
"You aren't supposed to come out of
the truck. You got him but who got me?

1005
01:16:35,249 --> 01:16:37,923
Courier, you're gonna get hurt."

1006
01:16:39,503 --> 01:16:40,550
It's kind of short.

1007
01:16:40,713 --> 01:16:42,966
Go ahead, read what's on the page.

1008
01:16:43,591 --> 01:16:46,515
Right there? Um ....

1009
01:16:47,678 --> 01:16:50,306
"You aren't supposed
to come out of the truck."

1010
01:16:50,473 --> 01:16:54,068
-Come on, come on.
-"You got him but who got me?"

1011
01:16:57,521 --> 01:17:01,276
"Come here, get on the ground,
before I pop your fucking teeth out!"

1012
01:17:03,152 --> 01:17:06,201
Come on, read it. Read it all.
There's about five things there.

1013
01:17:06,947 --> 01:17:08,824
Uh ....

1014
01:17:09,575 --> 01:17:11,418
What is it with you guys
in Charlestown?

1015
01:17:11,577 --> 01:17:14,626
Don't they teach you how to read?
There's things here. Read them.

1016
01:17:14,789 --> 01:17:17,042
I don't wanna read that.
This doesn't sound right.

1017
01:17:17,208 --> 01:17:20,382
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.
Read the pages, please.

1018
01:17:20,544 --> 01:17:22,717
I'm trying to make this
sound authenticious.

1019
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,178
-You got it all fucked up.
-Authen-what?

1020
01:17:27,968 --> 01:17:29,470
Thanks.

1021
01:17:29,637 --> 01:17:32,436
-Hey, Dougy, How are you?
-Oh.

1022
01:17:34,266 --> 01:17:35,893
How you doing?

1023
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:38,028
Local crime fighter.

1024
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:39,897
What's happening, Dino?

1025
01:17:40,981 --> 01:17:42,528
I know your father.

1026
01:17:44,318 --> 01:17:47,037
Yeah. Me too.

1027
01:17:47,196 --> 01:17:49,290
Got a few years left on his bid.

1028
01:17:50,032 --> 01:17:51,955
Yeah, one or two.

1029
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:55,504
I hear they got to the old guy.

1030
01:17:56,122 --> 01:17:57,795
Split him up the back.

1031
01:17:57,957 --> 01:17:59,209
Fucking animals.

1032
01:17:59,625 --> 01:18:02,128
You'd think they'd go after
a younger kid.

1033
01:18:02,419 --> 01:18:05,423
I don't know.
Making a statement, I guess.

1034
01:18:05,798 --> 01:18:08,176
Townie crews ain't
what they used to be.

1035
01:18:09,593 --> 01:18:11,095
Dorchester...

1036
01:18:11,262 --> 01:18:12,559
...Southie...

1037
01:18:13,139 --> 01:18:15,107
...looking to make a move.

1038
01:18:16,225 --> 01:18:18,944
Maybe you can change all that
when you get up there.

1039
01:18:20,312 --> 01:18:23,236
Let me ask you a question.
What do you call a guy...

1040
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:26,619
...who grows up with a group of people,
gets to know their secrets...

1041
01:18:26,777 --> 01:18:28,871
...because they trust him,
and then turns around...

1042
01:18:29,029 --> 01:18:32,784
...and use those secrets against them,
put those people in prison?

1043
01:18:33,409 --> 01:18:36,413
You'd call him a rat, right?
You know what I call him?

1044
01:18:36,579 --> 01:18:38,252
Dino the dago.

1045
01:18:38,414 --> 01:18:41,258
Those people made you
a part of that community.

1046
01:18:41,417 --> 01:18:43,260
What did they get for it?

1047
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:45,964
Inside of the fucking can.

1048
01:18:47,423 --> 01:18:51,018
You know we lifted a print
off the van? Right?

1049
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:01,438
Special Agent Frawley...

1050
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:02,771
"Douglas MacRay.

1051
01:19:05,649 --> 01:19:07,322
You and your boys didn't just...

1052
01:19:08,152 --> 01:19:12,248
...roll a Star Market
over in Malden for a box of quarters.

1053
01:19:12,615 --> 01:19:14,617
No, you decided to bang it out...

1054
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:18,128
...in the North End at 9:00 in the morning.
With assault rifles.

1055
01:19:19,079 --> 01:19:22,424
You fucking dummies shot a guard.

1056
01:19:23,709 --> 01:19:27,509
Now you're like a half-off sale
at Big and Tall, every cop is in line.

1057
01:19:27,671 --> 01:19:29,514
Fortunately, though, for you...

1058
01:19:29,673 --> 01:19:32,472
...this guard,
who is two-thirds to a retard...

1059
01:19:32,635 --> 01:19:34,228
...has miraculously clung to life.

1060
01:19:34,386 --> 01:19:36,013
Now, if it were up to me...

1061
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:38,933
...and they gave me two minutes
and a wet towel...

1062
01:19:39,308 --> 01:19:41,606
...I would personally asphyxiate
this half-wit...

1063
01:19:41,769 --> 01:19:43,988
...so we could string you up
on a federal M1...

1064
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:46,319
...and end this story
with a bag on your head...

1065
01:19:46,482 --> 01:19:49,326
...and a paralyzing agent
running through your veins.

1066
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:53,872
This isn't fucking townie hopscotch
anymore, Doug.

1067
01:19:55,324 --> 01:19:56,701
But I did want to say one thing.

1068
01:19:57,159 --> 01:20:00,834
Just so we're both very, very clear.

1069
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:03,924
Because in these situations,
sometimes, you know...

1070
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:08,426
...various parties will bandy about
the possibility of sentence reduction...

1071
01:20:08,587 --> 01:20:12,842
...for cooperation
or otherwise assisting the--

1072
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:15,352
Assisting the prosecution.

1073
01:20:17,721 --> 01:20:19,519
Not this time.

1074
01:20:21,183 --> 01:20:23,527
You're here today
so I could personally tell you...

1075
01:20:23,686 --> 01:20:26,656
...that you are going to die
in federal prison.

1076
01:20:27,523 --> 01:20:29,696
And so are all your friends.

1077
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:31,618
No deal.

1078
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:33,199
No compromise.

1079
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:36,498
And when that day comes...

1080
01:20:36,657 --> 01:20:39,536
...when you start trying to be
my hero collaborator so hard...

1081
01:20:39,702 --> 01:20:42,706
...that I have to slap you to shut up--
And it will come...

1082
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:48,719
...despite your pitiable,
misguided, Irish omerta.

1083
01:20:48,877 --> 01:20:52,381
--when your code of silence
finally gives way...

1084
01:20:52,548 --> 01:20:57,645
...to fear of trafficking in cigarettes
to prevent sexual enslavement...

1085
01:20:58,971 --> 01:21:03,818
...I just want you to know that it's gonna
be me who tells you to go fuck yourself.

1086
01:21:08,564 --> 01:21:12,944
Hey, next time you guys
wanna take pictures of me, just call ahead.

1087
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:15,238
You know, we can do better
than a barbeque.

1088
01:21:15,404 --> 01:21:17,657
A calendar shoot. You know?

1089
01:21:17,823 --> 01:21:19,541
Maybe topless, lubed up.

1090
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,577
Whatever you guys are into.

1091
01:21:22,536 --> 01:21:25,085
FBI car antennas
are half-inch matte black...

1092
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:27,966
...about three-quarters the way down
the rear windshield.

1093
01:21:28,125 --> 01:21:29,377
Stacie are pigtailed...

1094
01:21:29,543 --> 01:21:31,295
...B.P.D., half and half.

1095
01:21:31,712 --> 01:21:35,762
Every peewee in the town knows
what an FBI rear antenna looks like.

1096
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:39,554
So, in the future, if you guys
are gonna try to be slick...

1097
01:21:40,262 --> 01:21:42,310
...be slicker than a 6-year-old.

1098
01:21:43,057 --> 01:21:44,775
I gotta get back to work.

1099
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,727
Can I go?

1100
01:21:50,314 --> 01:21:52,157
Good luck with that print.

1101
01:22:22,679 --> 01:22:24,272
Good morning, Cambridge Savings.

1102
01:22:24,431 --> 01:22:27,150
Claire Keesey, please.
She's the manager.

1103
01:22:27,309 --> 01:22:30,153
Oh, she's no longer working here.

1104
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:31,814
-Since when?
-Friday.

1105
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:35,860
Just get the warrant. Land, cell, e-mail,
fax, Skype. The whole fucking thing.

1106
01:22:42,116 --> 01:22:45,245
-Oh, my God, Doug,
-Took me forever trying to pick it out.

1107
01:22:45,411 --> 01:22:48,335
-Yeah, it's beautiful.
-Is that all right?

1108
01:22:48,497 --> 01:22:52,092
Yeah, but I can't accept that from you.
I can't take that,

1109
01:22:52,251 --> 01:22:55,471
Why not? You can hawk it.
I'm not taking it back.

1110
01:22:55,629 --> 01:22:57,677
No. I mean, you can't--

1111
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,559
Keep it. Come on, sit down. Sit down.

1112
01:23:00,717 --> 01:23:03,061
-Sit down.
-Okay.

1113
01:23:08,475 --> 01:23:09,818
Wow.

1114
01:23:12,312 --> 01:23:14,656
I quit my job today.

1115
01:23:14,815 --> 01:23:16,237
What?

1116
01:23:17,901 --> 01:23:19,619
What are you gonna do?

1117
01:23:20,571 --> 01:23:27,250
Uh, I don't know. Volunteer full-time.
Maybe go back to teaching.

1118
01:23:27,411 --> 01:23:30,540
I have a little cushion.

1119
01:23:32,416 --> 01:23:33,884
You know...

1120
01:23:34,334 --> 01:23:37,838
...people get up every day,
they do the same thing.

1121
01:23:38,005 --> 01:23:42,135
They tell themself they're gonna
change their life one day and they never do.

1122
01:23:42,843 --> 01:23:44,891
I'm gonna change mine.

1123
01:23:46,847 --> 01:23:48,770
Why don't you do it with me?

1124
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:51,519
Go somewhere.

1125
01:23:51,685 --> 01:23:56,737
I got a little sofa put away.

1126
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:00,740
Give it a shot.

1127
01:24:03,363 --> 01:24:05,115
Well, where would we go?

1128
01:24:06,074 --> 01:24:08,122
Wherever you want. I don't know.

1129
01:24:08,285 --> 01:24:09,753
See what we got there.

1130
01:24:11,038 --> 01:24:14,713
Doesn't have to be a big thing, you know?
I thought about going down to...

1131
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:19,096
...see if my grandma's place is still there.
Tangerine, Florida.

1132
01:24:19,254 --> 01:24:21,598
But I'll go to any town
named after a food.

1133
01:24:21,757 --> 01:24:24,681
Grapefruit, Michigan.
Watermelon, New Mexico.

1134
01:24:24,843 --> 01:24:27,471
Just pick it on a map.

1135
01:24:31,141 --> 01:24:35,396
You ever read that paper "The Town"?

1136
01:24:35,938 --> 01:24:38,316
-The free paper? Yeah.
-Uh-huh,

1137
01:24:40,025 --> 01:24:43,996
I was clearing my foyer the other day...

1138
01:24:44,154 --> 01:24:48,625
...and there was a picture of the guys
who were harassing me in the bricks.

1139
01:24:49,785 --> 01:24:51,207
-Yeah?
-Mm-hm.

1140
01:24:51,370 --> 01:24:54,419
It was an article
about how one of them got shot.

1141
01:24:55,749 --> 01:24:58,002
-Say who did it?
-No.

1142
01:24:58,544 --> 01:25:01,263
Local gangsters, apparently.

1143
01:25:03,507 --> 01:25:07,057
I guess that's what you get
for being out on the street dealing drugs.

1144
01:25:07,844 --> 01:25:10,768
What makes you say
they were dealing drugs?

1145
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:15,903
I grew up out there, Claire.
Believe me, that kid was selling drugs.

1146
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,198
What do you want me to say?

1147
01:25:20,524 --> 01:25:24,995
I feel bad the kid who was terrorizing you
ran into the wrong guys?

1148
01:25:25,654 --> 01:25:27,156
Believe me, I don't.

1149
01:25:28,115 --> 01:25:31,415
You know, I care about you.
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

1150
01:25:31,577 --> 01:25:33,579
You don't go after women.

1151
01:25:33,745 --> 01:25:36,715
He hurt you, someone hurt him.
Too bad. That's the way it goes.

1152
01:25:36,873 --> 01:25:39,001
You know? That's karma.

1153
01:25:42,129 --> 01:25:44,882
I don't think karma works like that.

1154
01:25:46,592 --> 01:25:51,189
Well, however it works,
it worked out bad for them kids, you know?

1155
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:55,351
And I'm not gonna shed a tear over it.

1156
01:25:56,810 --> 01:25:58,858
Let's go get some food, okay?

1157
01:26:03,525 --> 01:26:05,027
Frawl.

1158
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:08,701
What is it?

1159
01:26:08,864 --> 01:26:12,539
Phone conversation between Claire Keesey
and a burner cell about an hour ago.

1160
01:26:12,701 --> 01:26:15,295
See if you can recognize the voice.

1161
01:26:16,371 --> 01:26:18,715
Hey, can I come over?
I want to talk to you.

1162
01:26:18,874 --> 01:26:20,717
Yeah. Where have you been?

1163
01:26:21,126 --> 01:26:22,548
Sorry, I got held up.

1164
01:26:22,711 --> 01:26:24,554
I'm coming over from my place.

1165
01:26:24,713 --> 01:26:26,681
Will you come down the back
and let me in?

1166
01:26:29,509 --> 01:26:31,728
Hadn't realized you'd left
your job at the bank.

1167
01:26:32,721 --> 01:26:36,442
Uh .... Oh, yeah. Yeah. Last week.

1168
01:26:38,352 --> 01:26:40,696
I'm sorry,
was I supposed to notify someone?

1169
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,073
Fancy.

1170
01:26:47,277 --> 01:26:48,870
Yeah. It was a gift.

1171
01:26:54,576 --> 01:26:57,079
Look, I think maybe you should go.

1172
01:26:57,245 --> 01:26:59,293
We have our suspects.

1173
01:27:00,749 --> 01:27:03,298
I came by to share this with you.

1174
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:08,632
James Coughlin.

1175
01:27:08,882 --> 01:27:10,850
Albert Magloan.

1176
01:27:12,177 --> 01:27:13,724
Desmond Elden.

1177
01:27:13,887 --> 01:27:16,811
Part of a crew that we tied
into the bankjob at North End...

1178
01:27:16,973 --> 01:27:21,069
...and at least three other
armored car robberies.

1179
01:27:25,524 --> 01:27:27,071
Look familiar?

1180
01:27:29,736 --> 01:27:32,285
You opened the safe for him.

1181
01:27:33,031 --> 01:27:35,454
He left you unharmed...

1182
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:40,669
...and now the two of you are carrying on a
relationship about which you lied to the FBI.

1183
01:27:40,831 --> 01:27:41,923
I was wrong.

1184
01:27:42,916 --> 01:27:44,793
You do need a lawyer.

1185
01:27:52,801 --> 01:27:54,428
Something wrong with the apartment?

1186
01:27:54,594 --> 01:27:56,813
No, Florist.

1187
01:27:57,723 --> 01:27:58,895
Florist? What?

1188
01:27:59,057 --> 01:28:00,559
Came through.

1189
01:28:01,017 --> 01:28:04,317
-Oh, Jesus Christ.
-It's large, Dougy.

1190
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:06,652
-It's large.
-We're smoked. Punt it.

1191
01:28:06,982 --> 01:28:09,952
-Who else is gonna buy it?
-You should've thought about that...

1192
01:28:10,110 --> 01:28:12,704
...before you kept breaking the guy off
for 40 dimes.

1193
01:28:12,863 --> 01:28:15,207
-There's an expectation for me.
-I'll correct it.

1194
01:28:15,365 --> 01:28:18,995
-Oh, you will? Okay.
-Yeah. Look.

1195
01:28:19,161 --> 01:28:24,338
Look, pick up an extra guy. All right?
Or go with three guys.

1196
01:28:24,583 --> 01:28:26,836
Or fucking be smart and boot it.

1197
01:28:27,002 --> 01:28:28,970
Oh, so you're not going?

1198
01:28:30,130 --> 01:28:31,382
No.

1199
01:28:33,175 --> 01:28:34,597
And why's that?

1200
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:37,104
Because we got a ton of heat on us,
for one thing.

1201
01:28:37,262 --> 01:28:39,685
We'll put a move on.
We've done it a hundred times.

1202
01:28:39,848 --> 01:28:42,897
You know what? Forget it.
Do what you want to do. I'm done.

1203
01:28:43,059 --> 01:28:44,686
-What? What?
-I'm done.

1204
01:28:44,853 --> 01:28:47,197
-You're done?
-What does it sound like?

1205
01:28:47,355 --> 01:28:50,029
-I don't know. What's that mean?
-What you think it means?

1206
01:28:50,192 --> 01:28:52,661
What does that mean?
Sounds like a bunch of bullshit.

1207
01:28:52,819 --> 01:28:56,699
I'm putting
this whole fucking town in my rear-view.

1208
01:28:59,159 --> 01:29:01,537
There's people I can't let you
walk away from.

1209
01:29:02,996 --> 01:29:04,213
What?

1210
01:29:04,998 --> 01:29:06,375
Who?

1211
01:29:08,001 --> 01:29:09,423
Come on.

1212
01:29:12,214 --> 01:29:14,342
Are you serious, Jimmy?

1213
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:16,552
She's not my kid.

1214
01:29:21,556 --> 01:29:23,775
I mean, come the f--Cut it out.

1215
01:29:23,934 --> 01:29:26,028
All you give a fuck about
is coke and Xbox...

1216
01:29:26,186 --> 01:29:29,065
...now you're trying to play it off
like you care about Shyne?

1217
01:29:29,231 --> 01:29:32,110
Know what your problem is?
You think you're better than people.

1218
01:29:32,275 --> 01:29:34,949
Mr. Fucking-Clean.
Mr. Fucking-Goddamn-High-and-Mighty.

1219
01:29:35,111 --> 01:29:37,864
I'm better than all these people.
I'm better than everybody.

1220
01:29:38,031 --> 01:29:40,284
But you grew up right here.

1221
01:29:40,867 --> 01:29:42,961
Same rules that I did.

1222
01:29:43,495 --> 01:29:44,792
Okay.

1223
01:29:45,247 --> 01:29:46,794
What else?

1224
01:29:48,917 --> 01:29:50,419
Who the fuck's the father?

1225
01:29:51,628 --> 01:29:53,756
-I know I'm not.
-You were the one fucking her.

1226
01:29:53,922 --> 01:29:56,175
Yeah, I wasn't the only one, brother.

1227
01:29:56,424 --> 01:29:58,643
Okay? She knew
I knew I'm not the father...

1228
01:29:58,802 --> 01:30:01,396
...and I have enough respect for her
not to ask her.

1229
01:30:01,555 --> 01:30:03,273
Because I don't think she knows.

1230
01:30:03,431 --> 01:30:06,275
I don't wanna shatter
your illusions here, partner.

1231
01:30:06,434 --> 01:30:08,562
There aren't enough free clinics
in Mattapan...

1232
01:30:08,728 --> 01:30:11,322
...to find out who the father
of that kid is.

1233
01:30:11,857 --> 01:30:14,326
I don't know who the fuck
you think you are either.

1234
01:30:14,985 --> 01:30:17,704
You aren't letting me
or not letting me do shit, all right?

1235
01:30:17,863 --> 01:30:19,536
Here's a little cheat sheet for you.

1236
01:30:19,698 --> 01:30:22,793
It's never gonna be me and you
and your sister and Shyne...

1237
01:30:22,951 --> 01:30:24,544
...fucking playing house up there.

1238
01:30:24,703 --> 01:30:28,003
All right? You got it?
Get that in your fucking head!

1239
01:30:28,164 --> 01:30:31,168
I'm tired of your one-way
fucking bullshit.

1240
01:30:31,334 --> 01:30:35,464
If you wanna see me again,
come down and visit me in Florida.

1241
01:30:41,344 --> 01:30:42,391
Cunt.

1242
01:31:10,665 --> 01:31:12,588
In the 302...

1243
01:31:13,376 --> 01:31:16,050
...Feds have me dropping Brendan
right here.

1244
01:31:17,631 --> 01:31:19,929
I got him back on Tibbetts.

1245
01:31:21,509 --> 01:31:23,511
Shot him right in the chest.

1246
01:31:25,013 --> 01:31:26,356
I remember he looked at me.

1247
01:31:26,514 --> 01:31:30,018
I don't know who was more fucking
surprised he wasn't dead, him or me.

1248
01:31:30,352 --> 01:31:32,354
We just kind of stood there...

1249
01:31:33,021 --> 01:31:36,491
...for a second, like, waiting for some
shit to happen. I don't know what.

1250
01:31:37,692 --> 01:31:39,365
He started running.

1251
01:31:39,861 --> 01:31:42,831
Fucking guy ran 100 yards
with a bullet in his heart, Dougy.

1252
01:31:42,989 --> 01:31:47,119
I mean, the fucking guy should've ran track.
You know what I'm saying?

1253
01:31:51,206 --> 01:31:52,583
I didn't ask you to do that.

1254
01:31:52,749 --> 01:31:54,877
Yeah, well, you didn't have to, Dougy.
Come on.

1255
01:31:55,543 --> 01:31:59,468
They told me Brendan was coming down
here to roll up on you with a Glock 21,

1256
01:31:59,631 --> 01:32:02,601
so I came over here,
and I put him in the fucking ground.

1257
01:32:04,469 --> 01:32:06,187
Did nine years for it.

1258
01:32:08,139 --> 01:32:09,891
Now, you don't gotta thank me...

1259
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,398
...but you're not walking away.

1260
01:32:14,562 --> 01:32:17,406
I'm grateful for everything you done
for me.

1261
01:32:18,692 --> 01:32:21,662
Your family took me in
when my father went away.

1262
01:32:24,489 --> 01:32:26,332
You're like a brother to me.

1263
01:32:28,076 --> 01:32:29,749
But I'm leaving.

1264
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:34,207
Gonna shoot me?

1265
01:32:35,417 --> 01:32:36,919
Go ahead.

1266
01:32:38,211 --> 01:32:40,634
But you're gonna have to shoot me
in the back.

1267
01:32:52,851 --> 01:32:54,774
-Don't get up.
-All right.

1268
01:32:54,936 --> 01:32:56,734
How you doing, Fergie?

1269
01:32:56,896 --> 01:33:00,696
Listen, just wanted to stop by
and tell you myself...

1270
01:33:01,443 --> 01:33:04,196
...whatever this thing is you got
going on...

1271
01:33:04,362 --> 01:33:07,457
...I think my guys can handle it
without me. You know what I mean?

1272
01:33:07,615 --> 01:33:09,617
I wouldn't hire them without you.

1273
01:33:09,784 --> 01:33:11,707
And I wouldn't hire you without them.

1274
01:33:11,870 --> 01:33:13,122
You're a unit.

1275
01:33:13,288 --> 01:33:17,088
Look, with all due respect,
I didn't come here for a debate.

1276
01:33:17,625 --> 01:33:19,298
I'm not doing it.

1277
01:33:19,544 --> 01:33:23,424
So, you know, work it out
however you can. I ....

1278
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:26,389
Calm down. Okay?

1279
01:33:26,551 --> 01:33:29,475
It goes against
my better judgment...

1280
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:33,309
...but just out of respect,
smooth things over...

1281
01:33:33,808 --> 01:33:36,106
...just take this for it, all right?

1282
01:33:36,686 --> 01:33:37,778
Not gonna cut it.

1283
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:41,484
Do you think I'm gonna put
Joe Flipperhead on this?

1284
01:33:41,983 --> 01:33:43,951
You're gonna do what I ask.

1285
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:45,327
Not gonna cut it, huh?

1286
01:33:47,906 --> 01:33:49,158
Okay.

1287
01:33:49,324 --> 01:33:52,419
Let me ask you something.
Who the fuck do you think you are?

1288
01:33:52,827 --> 01:33:54,921
The only guy in Charlestown
with a gun?

1289
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:57,253
You guys run numbers and pump dope.

1290
01:33:57,415 --> 01:34:00,510
You're an old guy who don't know
his glory years are behind him.

1291
01:34:00,668 --> 01:34:03,672
I ain't fucking working for you.
Got it?

1292
01:34:04,339 --> 01:34:08,765
You got a problem with that, I live at
551 Bunker Hill Street. Stop by anytime.

1293
01:34:08,927 --> 01:34:10,645
You know where to find me.

1294
01:34:11,262 --> 01:34:13,310
You're gonna do this for me...

1295
01:34:13,473 --> 01:34:15,851
...or I'm gonna clip your nuts...

1296
01:34:16,184 --> 01:34:17,652
...like I clipped your daddy's.

1297
01:34:18,269 --> 01:34:19,816
Don't talk about my father.

1298
01:34:19,979 --> 01:34:22,528
Son, I knew your daddy.

1299
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:25,614
He worked for me for years. Years.

1300
01:34:26,152 --> 01:34:28,246
Then he wanted his own thing.

1301
01:34:30,990 --> 01:34:32,037
You play the horses?

1302
01:34:33,827 --> 01:34:38,583
You know, they either geld a horse
with a knife...

1303
01:34:38,748 --> 01:34:40,716
...or with the chemicals.

1304
01:34:41,209 --> 01:34:43,303
When your daddy said no to me...

1305
01:34:43,753 --> 01:34:45,721
...I did him the chemical way.

1306
01:34:46,297 --> 01:34:48,049
Gave your mother a taste.

1307
01:34:48,216 --> 01:34:49,843
Put the hook into her.

1308
01:34:50,218 --> 01:34:52,562
She doped up good and proper.

1309
01:34:53,346 --> 01:34:56,145
Hung herself with a wire
on Melnea Cass.

1310
01:34:56,766 --> 01:34:59,690
And you? Running around
the neighborhood, looking for her.

1311
01:35:00,562 --> 01:35:02,906
Your daddy didn't have the heart
to tell his son...

1312
01:35:03,064 --> 01:35:06,238
...that he was looking for a suicide doper
who was never coming home.

1313
01:35:07,652 --> 01:35:11,031
If there's a heaven, son,
she ain't in it.

1314
01:35:16,369 --> 01:35:17,416
Oh.

1315
01:35:19,581 --> 01:35:22,004
I hear you got a nice,
sweet new girlfriend.

1316
01:35:22,167 --> 01:35:23,714
Lives on the park.

1317
01:35:24,502 --> 01:35:27,597
I don't want to send her
funeral arrangement to your house...

1318
01:35:28,464 --> 01:35:30,307
...but I will if I have to.

1319
01:35:31,301 --> 01:35:33,349
Now I know where to find you.

1320
01:35:35,138 --> 01:35:36,606
Claire.

1321
01:35:37,599 --> 01:35:39,226
Claire?

1322
01:35:50,904 --> 01:35:52,121
-Hey.
-Get out.

1323
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:53,452
You okay?

1324
01:35:54,199 --> 01:35:56,622
-Get out.
-Hold on one second.

1325
01:35:56,784 --> 01:35:58,286
I have this on 911.

1326
01:35:58,453 --> 01:36:01,627
All right, you need to give me a chance
to explain myself first. Okay?

1327
01:36:01,789 --> 01:36:02,881
No. You had a chance.

1328
01:36:04,209 --> 01:36:05,756
Who talked to you?

1329
01:36:07,212 --> 01:36:09,465
The FBI, Doug.

1330
01:36:11,716 --> 01:36:13,639
You have to listen to me.

1331
01:36:13,801 --> 01:36:16,304
You have to let me explain this.
You understand?

1332
01:36:16,471 --> 01:36:19,691
-There's a lot going on here, Claire--
-No, you go to fucking hell!

1333
01:36:20,433 --> 01:36:22,310
-Fucking hell.
-All right, all right.

1334
01:36:22,477 --> 01:36:23,979
All right. All right.

1335
01:36:24,145 --> 01:36:25,772
Easy, now.

1336
01:36:26,981 --> 01:36:28,904
Why did you do this to me?

1337
01:36:29,067 --> 01:36:31,866
Claire, I'm sorry. Okay?

1338
01:36:32,028 --> 01:36:34,907
I was gonna tell you.
I came over here that night to tell you.

1339
01:36:35,073 --> 01:36:38,748
What, the night you fucked me?
ls that your thing?

1340
01:36:38,910 --> 01:36:43,461
It's not enough to terrorize someone,
you have to fuck them too?

1341
01:36:43,623 --> 01:36:48,470
-Listen to me. Calm down, okay?
-No. No. Get out. Get out!

1342
01:36:49,963 --> 01:36:54,844
You don't ever let me see you again.
Never, never.

1343
01:39:23,533 --> 01:39:25,752
I'm taking off for a while.

1344
01:39:26,411 --> 01:39:28,584
Are you taking heat?

1345
01:39:36,337 --> 01:39:38,465
Well, when are you coming back?

1346
01:39:44,470 --> 01:39:47,849
You know about this thing for Fergie
Jem wants me to do?

1347
01:39:48,015 --> 01:39:49,358
Yeah.

1348
01:39:53,104 --> 01:39:55,198
Tell him I say yes for me, will you?

1349
01:39:58,025 --> 01:39:59,493
Yeah.

1350
01:40:11,539 --> 01:40:13,007
All right.

1351
01:40:14,459 --> 01:40:15,711
I'm in.

1352
01:40:16,878 --> 01:40:19,131
But if anything happens to her...

1353
01:40:19,297 --> 01:40:21,550
...if I think anything
might happen to her...

1354
01:40:22,383 --> 01:40:23,555
...I'm coming back here.

1355
01:40:24,594 --> 01:40:27,643
And I'm gonna kill both of you
in your own shop.

1356
01:40:43,905 --> 01:40:45,623
Hey, Claire?

1357
01:40:47,241 --> 01:40:50,711
I just wanna talk to you,
just for two minutes. Okay?

1358
01:40:51,412 --> 01:40:53,005
Come on.

1359
01:40:54,457 --> 01:40:55,925
Claire, I would never hurt you.

1360
01:40:56,083 --> 01:40:58,552
I don't know what you would--
Don't fucking touch me.

1361
01:40:58,711 --> 01:40:59,883
All right.

1362
01:41:00,254 --> 01:41:01,597
I'm sorry.

1363
01:41:02,089 --> 01:41:04,592
Just listen to me for a second,
all right?

1364
01:41:04,759 --> 01:41:06,261
I will never lie to you again.

1365
01:41:06,427 --> 01:41:08,600
-Really?
-Yes, I promise you.

1366
01:41:09,096 --> 01:41:11,440
Ask me anything you want.
I'll tell you the truth.

1367
01:41:11,599 --> 01:41:13,476
-Why? I won't believe you.
-Yes, you will.

1368
01:41:13,643 --> 01:41:14,690
Why?

1369
01:41:14,852 --> 01:41:17,105
Because you'll fucking hate
the answers.

1370
01:41:21,817 --> 01:41:24,491
-You knew I was the manager in the bank?
-Yup.

1371
01:41:24,654 --> 01:41:27,032
-Were you following me?
-Yes.

1372
01:41:27,406 --> 01:41:28,953
How many banks have you robbed?

1373
01:41:29,825 --> 01:41:31,372
Six trucks, two banks.

1374
01:41:31,786 --> 01:41:33,379
Have you ever killed anyone?

1375
01:41:33,538 --> 01:41:35,085
No.

1376
01:41:36,207 --> 01:41:37,504
Think about it.

1377
01:41:38,209 --> 01:41:39,552
All right?

1378
01:41:39,710 --> 01:41:42,133
I will never lie to you,
I will never hurt you...

1379
01:41:42,296 --> 01:41:47,598
...and if I lose you, I will
regret that for the rest of my life.

1380
01:41:50,471 --> 01:41:53,395
Just wait for me.

1381
01:42:05,403 --> 01:42:08,828
You know, it's funny.
I can see your daddies' faces in you.

1382
01:42:08,990 --> 01:42:10,082
All of youse.

1383
01:42:10,241 --> 01:42:11,993
Reminds me I'm still in the ring.

1384
01:42:12,326 --> 01:42:16,581
Still taking the punches.
Still ahead on points.

1385
01:42:16,956 --> 01:42:19,709
Now, I have a fellow
on the inside there.

1386
01:42:19,875 --> 01:42:23,675
He likes to play the ponies.
Has a gambling sickness.

1387
01:42:23,838 --> 01:42:26,466
He couldn't pick a horse
to save his fucking life.

1388
01:42:27,008 --> 01:42:29,306
But courtesy of this sick man...

1389
01:42:30,261 --> 01:42:32,980
...I have this, Hm?

1390
01:42:34,849 --> 01:42:37,648
Well, the gang's all here.

1391
01:42:39,937 --> 01:42:41,689
There's always a weak spot.

1392
01:42:41,856 --> 01:42:43,858
We just need to find it.

1393
01:42:47,403 --> 01:42:51,374
The cash is brought out and stacked
15 minutes before the van does the pickup.

1394
01:42:52,658 --> 01:42:54,752
That is when you hit.

1395
01:42:55,161 --> 01:42:57,914
And Monday morning,
after a four-game stand with New York...

1396
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:03,007
...60,000 beers, food, merchandise,
total haul:

1397
01:43:03,169 --> 01:43:04,671
Three and a half million.

1398
01:43:08,716 --> 01:43:13,062
Taking down the cathedral of Boston.

1399
01:43:13,262 --> 01:43:14,388
Priceless.

1400
01:43:29,362 --> 01:43:32,411
How long you think it's gonna take Rusty
to dump the inside man...

1401
01:43:32,573 --> 01:43:33,790
...when this thing's over?

1402
01:43:33,949 --> 01:43:36,577
Well, he should have picked
better horses.

1403
01:43:39,955 --> 01:43:42,708
This is gonna be a motherfucker.
You know that, right?

1404
01:43:43,751 --> 01:43:47,756
Well, if they were easy, kid,
everybody would do them.

1405
01:43:52,259 --> 01:43:55,638
Lined into right Held.
A base hit. Youkilis is headed for third base.

1406
01:43:55,805 --> 01:43:58,558
Hey, Bobby. Yeah, three Buds.

1407
01:44:06,857 --> 01:44:09,827
Seem to be having a bit
of a staring contest over there.

1408
01:44:09,985 --> 01:44:11,157
What can I say?

1409
01:44:11,779 --> 01:44:13,326
Boys like me.

1410
01:44:14,782 --> 01:44:16,125
I bet they do.

1411
01:44:21,789 --> 01:44:24,087
I was at a bar one night, right?

1412
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:27,094
There was this guy there
going around to all the ladies...

1413
01:44:27,253 --> 01:44:31,679
...and telling them that he was
judging a hugging contest.

1414
01:44:32,258 --> 01:44:35,182
Some of them actually bought it, right?

1415
01:44:35,344 --> 01:44:39,895
So he throws his arms around them,
rubs their back, grabs their ass.

1416
01:44:40,057 --> 01:44:41,434
Charming.

1417
01:44:42,977 --> 01:44:45,355
Finally I get sick of it
and I go up to this guy...

1418
01:44:45,646 --> 01:44:50,322
...and I tell him that I am judging
a face-punching contest.

1419
01:44:50,484 --> 01:44:53,988
Oh. I'd have punched him myself.

1420
01:45:03,164 --> 01:45:05,758
By the way, I'm here tonight
judging a fucking contest.

1421
01:45:09,670 --> 01:45:11,547
What are you doing down here?

1422
01:45:12,173 --> 01:45:13,425
Slumming?

1423
01:45:15,050 --> 01:45:16,848
I work for the FBI.

1424
01:45:17,803 --> 01:45:19,521
Me too.

1425
01:45:20,890 --> 01:45:22,358
Well, you must be new.

1426
01:45:25,686 --> 01:45:27,188
You're all right.

1427
01:45:28,063 --> 01:45:30,532
It doesn't mean
you're getting fucked, though.

1428
01:45:31,025 --> 01:45:34,529
You gotta chase the rabbit
if you want the tail.

1429
01:45:36,155 --> 01:45:37,452
My mom taught me that.

1430
01:45:42,119 --> 01:45:44,838
You used to hang around
with Doug MacRay a little bit, huh?

1431
01:45:45,998 --> 01:45:47,375
How do you know Dougy?

1432
01:45:47,541 --> 01:45:49,259
We sort of work together.

1433
01:45:49,668 --> 01:45:50,965
Sand and Gravel?

1434
01:45:51,587 --> 01:45:53,339
No. No, no.

1435
01:46:00,679 --> 01:46:03,057
You a pretty decent judge of size?

1436
01:46:03,599 --> 01:46:04,896
Depends.

1437
01:46:05,559 --> 01:46:07,061
Size of what?

1438
01:46:08,395 --> 01:46:09,897
How big would you say that is?

1439
01:46:10,773 --> 01:46:11,990
Six inches?

1440
01:46:12,566 --> 01:46:14,068
Over or under?

1441
01:46:14,401 --> 01:46:15,448
Under.

1442
01:46:15,611 --> 01:46:16,783
Wrong.

1443
01:46:17,363 --> 01:46:19,582
6.14 inches exactly.

1444
01:46:21,242 --> 01:46:23,370
I know everything there is to know
about money.

1445
01:46:23,577 --> 01:46:26,421
.0043 inches.

1446
01:46:27,248 --> 01:46:31,173
about one gram.

1447
01:46:31,877 --> 01:46:33,800
Which is interesting...

1448
01:46:33,963 --> 01:46:37,763
...because that means that this $20 bill
isn't even worth its own weight...

1449
01:46:37,925 --> 01:46:39,893
...in Oxy.

1450
01:46:45,599 --> 01:46:47,101
So how does it work?

1451
01:46:48,269 --> 01:46:50,112
Bartender gets a call...

1452
01:46:51,188 --> 01:46:54,192
...you pick up a package at point A,
deliver it to point B...

1453
01:46:54,358 --> 01:46:56,907
...the Florist gives you C?

1454
01:47:00,698 --> 01:47:02,541
You're thinking of running out on me.

1455
01:47:04,243 --> 01:47:07,292
It's not that simple.
Because, you see...

1456
01:47:08,372 --> 01:47:10,215
...I start waving this around
in here...

1457
01:47:14,962 --> 01:47:16,305
...bad for you.

1458
01:47:20,676 --> 01:47:22,303
I want a lawyer.

1459
01:47:22,636 --> 01:47:24,559
Good. Get one.

1460
01:47:25,472 --> 01:47:28,066
I mean, it's all about protecting
yourself, right?

1461
01:47:28,350 --> 01:47:31,650
Not even yourself. Your daughter.

1462
01:47:31,812 --> 01:47:34,315
Don't talk about my daughter.

1463
01:47:36,609 --> 01:47:38,987
How long were you with MacRay?

1464
01:47:40,070 --> 01:47:41,367
All my life.

1465
01:47:42,656 --> 01:47:45,250
In all those years
that you were together...

1466
01:47:47,161 --> 01:47:50,381
...how many diamond necklaces
did he give you?

1467
01:47:55,169 --> 01:47:59,675
All right, he-re's the deal.
Looks like we're pretty dialed in.

1468
01:48:02,301 --> 01:48:05,350
Dez took the van home
over the weekend...

1469
01:48:05,512 --> 01:48:07,139
...so that should work.

1470
01:48:10,476 --> 01:48:13,696
He"s meeting bug eyes at the plant
on Monday.

1471
01:48:17,816 --> 01:48:21,821
Krista booked the rooms, set up the outfits,
and made the New Hampshire run.

1472
01:48:24,323 --> 01:48:26,451
That's what I got, How you looking?

1473
01:48:26,617 --> 01:48:28,369
All right, the tools are set.

1474
01:48:28,535 --> 01:48:30,708
Got our body armor.

1475
01:48:34,124 --> 01:48:35,967
You know, this thing goes right...

1476
01:48:36,377 --> 01:48:38,755
...could be your turn
to step away too.

1477
01:48:38,921 --> 01:48:41,891
Yeah. Sure.

1478
01:48:42,132 --> 01:48:43,725
What am I gonna do, Dougy, huh?

1479
01:48:43,884 --> 01:48:48,390
Go down to Margaritaville, drink me
half a yard and fall off fucking bar stools?

1480
01:48:50,015 --> 01:48:51,562
Do me a favor.

1481
01:48:52,101 --> 01:48:53,899
The weight of this thing...

1482
01:48:54,561 --> 01:48:56,655
...pack a parachute at least.

1483
01:48:57,106 --> 01:48:59,825
You know the funniest thing
about being in prison?

1484
01:49:01,860 --> 01:49:04,158
Guys pretending
that they wanna get out.

1485
01:49:07,074 --> 01:49:08,371
Fuck.

1486
01:49:09,451 --> 01:49:13,081
You ever hear the old-timers
call a guy a "50-pound horse"?

1487
01:49:13,580 --> 01:49:16,049
"Fifty-pound horse"? No.

1488
01:49:16,208 --> 01:49:18,006
All right. Ahem.

1489
01:49:18,168 --> 01:49:20,512
A guy's walking with two horses, right?

1490
01:49:20,671 --> 01:49:24,426
One horse is carrying a hundred pounds,
the other one's got 50.

1491
01:49:24,591 --> 01:49:29,597
Now, the hundred-pound horse falls over
dead. So the guy's like, "What the fuck?"

1492
01:49:29,763 --> 01:49:32,858
Takes the hundred-pound sack,
puts it on the 50-pound horse.

1493
01:49:33,017 --> 01:49:35,941
Then that 50-pound horse,
he won't move,

1494
01:49:37,062 --> 01:49:40,441
He won't take one step
with another pound on his back.

1495
01:49:41,358 --> 01:49:42,951
That's me.

1496
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:50,208
This is all I know.

1497
01:49:53,412 --> 01:49:55,631
I can't do any more time, Dougy.

1498
01:49:58,375 --> 01:50:00,002
So if we get jammed up...

1499
01:50:00,627 --> 01:50:02,595
...we're holding court on the street.

1500
01:50:04,256 --> 01:50:05,303
All right?

1501
01:50:11,472 --> 01:50:12,940
Mule.

1502
01:50:14,224 --> 01:50:15,441
What's that?

1503
01:50:15,601 --> 01:50:17,854
The story the old-timers tell...

1504
01:50:18,020 --> 01:50:20,022
...it ain't a horse.

1505
01:50:20,522 --> 01:50:23,071
It's a 50-pound mule.

1506
01:50:24,151 --> 01:50:25,994
See you out there.

1507
01:50:29,948 --> 01:50:31,325
What time did he get here?

1508
01:50:31,492 --> 01:50:34,336
Six a.m. according to the GPS
we have on his truck.

1509
01:50:34,495 --> 01:50:35,621
So we alerted you.

1510
01:50:38,082 --> 01:50:39,800
Pop the door, kick their nuts in.

1511
01:50:39,958 --> 01:50:42,882
We should wait for them
to commit a crime, don't you think, Dino?

1512
01:50:43,045 --> 01:50:44,092
No switch car.

1513
01:50:45,506 --> 01:50:47,759
Ran a cue hot on the parking lot.

1514
01:50:47,925 --> 01:50:49,177
That Cherokee is boosted.

1515
01:50:55,307 --> 01:50:57,309
Call SWAT now.

1516
01:51:03,148 --> 01:51:04,320
FBI! Open the door!

1517
01:51:04,483 --> 01:51:06,110
-FBI!
-Open the door! Open it!

1518
01:51:06,276 --> 01:51:08,153
Open the door! Open it!

1519
01:51:08,529 --> 01:51:09,701
FBI! FBI!

1520
01:51:11,031 --> 01:51:13,409
You brought the whole fucking
cavalry for me?

1521
01:51:13,575 --> 01:51:15,748
I'm unarmed, you motherfuckers.

1522
01:51:32,970 --> 01:51:35,268
Fuck are you doing here, Kris?

1523
01:51:35,889 --> 01:51:37,186
I need to talk to you.

1524
01:51:37,349 --> 01:51:38,976
Not a great time, hon.

1525
01:51:39,143 --> 01:51:40,360
-I know,
-You know?

1526
01:51:40,519 --> 01:51:42,487
Okay. Well, what do you want?

1527
01:51:42,646 --> 01:51:43,943
Here you go.

1528
01:51:44,398 --> 01:51:46,196
Dez told me you were here.

1529
01:51:48,026 --> 01:51:49,403
I wanna see you before you go.

1530
01:51:49,570 --> 01:51:52,915
Kris, you could do 30 years
for walking in the door.

1531
01:51:53,073 --> 01:51:55,246
Okay? Do you understand that?
For being here.

1532
01:51:55,409 --> 01:51:58,458
You can't be bringing your kid
in here, you got it? You can't stay.

1533
01:51:58,620 --> 01:52:01,214
I don't wanna stay,
I wanna go with you.

1534
01:52:01,623 --> 01:52:03,466
-I wanna change too, Dougy.
-Christ.

1535
01:52:03,625 --> 01:52:06,549
Why the fuck can't I change?
I could be a different person.

1536
01:52:06,712 --> 01:52:08,055
Jesus Christ.

1537
01:52:08,213 --> 01:52:11,467
You tell me what you want me to do.
I'll be whoever you want me to be,

1538
01:52:12,843 --> 01:52:14,845
I'm leaving with somebody else.

1539
01:52:19,016 --> 01:52:20,313
Oh, yeah?

1540
01:52:20,934 --> 01:52:22,151
Yeah.

1541
01:52:24,021 --> 01:52:25,944
Why isn't she here then?

1542
01:52:27,149 --> 01:52:29,026
Come on.
What do you want me to tell you?

1543
01:52:29,193 --> 01:52:31,787
She's going away with you,
why isn't she here?

1544
01:52:31,945 --> 01:52:33,868
Where is she? She's not here.

1545
01:52:35,449 --> 01:52:37,668
-Such a trashy little fuck pad.
-Take it easy.

1546
01:52:37,826 --> 01:52:40,955
After a Tiffany necklace,
I thought a room at the Ritz.

1547
01:52:41,371 --> 01:52:42,918
Huh?

1548
01:52:44,082 --> 01:52:45,459
What'd you say?

1549
01:52:46,627 --> 01:52:49,471
Where did you hear that?
Where'd you hear about a necklace?

1550
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:51,473
A little bird.

1551
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:56,644
Fucking smartass. Who told you that?
Who told you about a necklace?

1552
01:52:58,138 --> 01:53:01,187
I know you'd rather see a rope
around my neck!

1553
01:53:02,851 --> 01:53:05,104
You're getting the fuck out of here.
Let's go.

1554
01:53:05,270 --> 01:53:08,274
Come here, honey.
I know, it's gonna be okay. It's all right.

1555
01:53:08,440 --> 01:53:10,818
-We're coming with you.
-You're getting out of here.

1556
01:53:10,984 --> 01:53:12,827
Dougy, we're fucking coming with you.

1557
01:53:12,986 --> 01:53:16,206
It's time to go, Okay? Here we go.

1558
01:53:16,365 --> 01:53:19,665
Time to go, sweetheart, Okay?

1559
01:53:19,826 --> 01:53:21,328
-I'm not leaving here.
-Let's go.

1560
01:53:21,495 --> 01:53:23,589
-I'm not fucking leaving.
-Take the kid home.

1561
01:53:23,747 --> 01:53:25,420
Get the fuck off me!

1562
01:53:25,582 --> 01:53:27,505
I can walk myself.

1563
01:53:28,001 --> 01:53:29,924
Don't you say no to me!

1564
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:34,762
Take this.

1565
01:53:42,182 --> 01:53:43,354
Hey.

1566
01:53:43,976 --> 01:53:47,321
Will you quit fucking doing that?
You're making me nervous.

1567
01:54:01,868 --> 01:54:05,213
Yeah, we got a DWI over here, one car.

1568
01:54:05,372 --> 01:54:08,797
Coughlin, Kristina.
She had a kid with her.

1569
01:54:09,459 --> 01:54:12,053
The mother's at Mass General.
She wanted me to call you.

1570
01:54:12,212 --> 01:54:14,840
All right, yeah. I'll be right there.

1571
01:54:43,118 --> 01:54:44,335
Officer.

1572
01:54:45,329 --> 01:54:46,876
Yeah. Let's go.

1573
01:54:54,171 --> 01:54:55,514
Down here.

1574
01:55:48,892 --> 01:55:50,565
There's the door.

1575
01:55:51,144 --> 01:55:53,772
And remember,
you never fucking saw me.

1576
01:55:54,022 --> 01:55:55,194
Okay.

1577
01:56:10,163 --> 01:56:12,882
Dr. Forrest, dial 112, please.

1578
01:56:13,041 --> 01:56:16,011
Dr. Forrest, please dial 112.

1579
01:56:20,173 --> 01:56:23,848
Here he is, Mr. Six-Inches.

1580
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:26,726
What happened?

1581
01:56:26,888 --> 01:56:30,313
You're a crimestopper,
figure it the fuck out.

1582
01:56:32,352 --> 01:56:33,604
Sweetheart.

1583
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:38,238
I know you have oxycodone,
cocaine and alcohol in your system.

1584
01:56:39,443 --> 01:56:42,037
I know that you have five cars
registered in your name.

1585
01:56:42,195 --> 01:56:45,699
And I know right now, your daughter
is sitting in the back of a state van...

1586
01:56:45,866 --> 01:56:48,119
... being driven by a stranger to
the Department of Social Services.

1587
01:56:48,285 --> 01:56:49,878
So how long you wanna do this?

1588
01:56:50,036 --> 01:56:51,208
I'm a person, you know?

1589
01:56:51,371 --> 01:56:53,544
A person
who's gonna need a plea agreement...

1590
01:56:53,707 --> 01:56:55,880
...if you ever want to see your kid again.

1591
01:56:59,504 --> 01:57:02,508
Why is it always I'm the one
who's getting used?

1592
01:57:03,425 --> 01:57:04,768
What do you have?

1593
01:57:10,807 --> 01:57:12,480
Knowing just that...

1594
01:57:13,894 --> 01:57:15,646
...Dougy's going away after.

1595
01:57:16,813 --> 01:57:19,657
Wait, what after? After what?

1596
01:57:21,860 --> 01:57:25,410
Krista, I need you to be smart here.

1597
01:57:25,822 --> 01:57:29,292
This could be a big moment for Shyne.

1598
01:57:30,494 --> 01:57:32,496
Make a huge difference in her life.

1599
01:57:39,961 --> 01:57:41,804
We can help you, sweetheart.

1600
01:58:36,476 --> 01:58:37,853
-You there?
-I'm here.

1601
01:58:38,019 --> 01:58:40,818
-All set.
-Okay. Go ahead.

1602
01:58:41,523 --> 01:58:42,820
All set.

1603
01:58:51,199 --> 01:58:52,325
Who called 911?

1604
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:55,545
You the guys who called 911?

1605
01:58:55,704 --> 01:58:57,206
No one from here called.

1606
01:58:57,372 --> 01:58:59,045
Nah, we didn't--It wasn't us.

1607
01:58:59,207 --> 01:59:00,424
We got a 911 call.

1608
01:59:00,584 --> 01:59:02,006
Robbery, guys. Come on.

1609
01:59:02,168 --> 01:59:03,715
-You said a robbery?
-Yeah.

1610
01:59:03,878 --> 01:59:05,596
A call saying you're being held up.

1611
01:59:05,755 --> 01:59:07,428
-Let me call Mike.
-We just walked past Mike.

1612
01:59:07,591 --> 01:59:08,592
He let us in.

1613
01:59:08,758 --> 01:59:11,682
Hey, look, guys, We got a distress call.
All right?

1614
01:59:11,845 --> 01:59:14,268
-So who made the call?
-Nobody called from here.

1615
01:59:15,140 --> 01:59:17,768
No one called? What are we doing here?

1616
01:59:17,934 --> 01:59:21,108
-Hold on. Where's Mike?
-I just told you where Mike was.

1617
01:59:21,271 --> 01:59:22,363
You boys see all right?

1618
01:59:22,522 --> 01:59:24,775
-Huh? You fucking smartass.
-Listen. Listen.

1619
01:59:24,941 --> 01:59:27,990
For our safety, for everyone's safety,
we need to see your IDs.

1620
01:59:28,153 --> 01:59:30,702
Guys, hold up.
We been here all morning, Take it easy.

1621
01:59:30,864 --> 01:59:33,868
My partner asked for your ID.
All right? We don't know you.

1622
01:59:34,034 --> 01:59:37,538
Till we identify all the parties involved here,
we're gonna need some IDs...

1623
01:59:37,704 --> 01:59:39,832
...we need to see
everyone on the ground. Right now.

1624
01:59:39,998 --> 01:59:41,215
Whoa, whoa.

1625
01:59:41,374 --> 01:59:43,627
-Get your hand off your weapon.
-Hey, relax.

1626
01:59:50,133 --> 01:59:52,932
-Get on the ground!
-Get on the fucking ground.

1627
01:59:53,303 --> 01:59:54,600
Hands behind your back.

1628
01:59:54,763 --> 01:59:55,935
Face down.

1629
01:59:56,097 --> 01:59:58,520
Behind your back. Come on.

1630
02:00:05,273 --> 02:00:08,368
Get your hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back. Let's go.

1631
02:00:08,526 --> 02:00:09,994
-Take it easy.
-Fuck.

1632
02:00:17,577 --> 02:00:18,829
In the cash room.

1633
02:00:18,995 --> 02:00:22,590
Arnold Washton.
You live at 311 Hazer Street in Quincy...

1634
02:00:22,749 --> 02:00:25,923
...with a wife named Linda
and three small dogs.

1635
02:00:26,086 --> 02:00:28,464
Do not make a distress call.

1636
02:00:28,630 --> 02:00:30,724
Also in the cash room:

1637
02:00:30,882 --> 02:00:36,059
Morton Previtt.
You live at 27 Counting Lane, Randolph.

1638
02:00:36,221 --> 02:00:38,519
Wife, also Linda.

1639
02:00:38,682 --> 02:00:42,732
Morton, the Lindas
want you to open this door.

1640
02:00:42,936 --> 02:00:45,564
We have men outside your homes.

1641
02:00:49,651 --> 02:00:52,495
Back up. Back up.

1642
02:01:13,508 --> 02:01:15,476
You think you're gonna get out of here?

1643
02:01:15,802 --> 02:01:19,102
I got friends that are guards at Walpole.
They'll make your lives hell.

1644
02:01:19,556 --> 02:01:21,558
Well, don't you worry about it,
old-timer.

1645
02:01:21,725 --> 02:01:23,477
No one's going to prison.

1646
02:01:41,411 --> 02:01:42,879
Ten more.

1647
02:01:43,037 --> 02:01:44,289
Right away.

1648
02:01:58,052 --> 02:01:59,304
Picking up.

1649
02:02:31,377 --> 02:02:33,971
--least from the fan base
when the Red Sox win.

1650
02:02:34,130 --> 02:02:38,180
When the Red Sox win in extra innings
and everybody can go home happy...

1651
02:02:38,343 --> 02:02:40,971
...and they're singing 'Dirty Water"--

1652
02:02:43,848 --> 02:02:45,816
-How you doing?
-Fucking beautiful.

1653
02:02:48,269 --> 02:02:49,612
Come on.

1654
02:02:58,321 --> 02:03:02,167
Last motherfucker who robbed
the Red Sox like this was Jack Clark.

1655
02:03:51,624 --> 02:03:54,924
Looked around the block.
There's no cars, no vans around. Nothing.

1656
02:03:55,128 --> 02:03:57,256
Maybe we're too early. Or too late.

1657
02:03:57,422 --> 02:04:01,518
Let's go. I want this street clear. Come on,
get these people out of here. Let's go.

1658
02:04:01,676 --> 02:04:06,807
We've been trying to hail security for the
cash room. We're not getting a response.

1659
02:04:09,017 --> 02:04:11,065
Okay, let's go,
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1660
02:04:11,227 --> 02:04:12,649
Come on.

1661
02:04:16,774 --> 02:04:18,026
Come on.

1662
02:04:22,322 --> 02:04:23,539
Shit.

1663
02:04:44,010 --> 02:04:47,014
-Fuck!
-Let's get the fuck out of here!

1664
02:04:52,393 --> 02:04:54,361
That's us inside.

1665
02:04:56,481 --> 02:04:57,698
Go! Go!

1666
02:05:02,028 --> 02:05:04,406
Fuckers!

1667
02:05:19,587 --> 02:05:21,681
Gloans! Gloans. Fuck.

1668
02:05:24,133 --> 02:05:27,763
-He all right?
-He's all right. They just got the vest.

1669
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:38,489
Yo, Dez, get the plunger!

1670
02:05:57,875 --> 02:05:59,718
Shut it!

1671
02:06:20,857 --> 02:06:22,734
Dez?

1672
02:06:24,318 --> 02:06:25,820
Come on, come on.

1673
02:06:28,072 --> 02:06:29,574
They look like EMTs.

1674
02:06:29,741 --> 02:06:32,460
I count four. Maybe one down.

1675
02:06:32,618 --> 02:06:34,245
Go.

1676
02:06:36,748 --> 02:06:38,341
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1677
02:06:38,791 --> 02:06:41,044
There's a million fucking cops
out there.

1678
02:06:41,210 --> 02:06:42,757
Dez!

1679
02:06:45,631 --> 02:06:46,678
Listen.

1680
02:06:48,176 --> 02:06:52,807
The three of us, even if we get out of here,
we're getting the full ride, okay?

1681
02:06:53,306 --> 02:06:56,025
You walk out with your hands up,
you could get seven years.

1682
02:06:56,768 --> 02:06:58,770
No one'll think the worse of you.

1683
02:07:01,064 --> 02:07:02,156
Fuck you.

1684
02:07:08,279 --> 02:07:09,576
Cover your ears!

1685
02:07:34,180 --> 02:07:35,272
No!

1686
02:07:42,355 --> 02:07:44,653
-All right, go, go, go.
-All right, move it out.

1687
02:08:01,833 --> 02:08:03,050
Fuck you!

1688
02:08:09,423 --> 02:08:11,551
Move down.
Get them the fuck out of here.

1689
02:08:11,717 --> 02:08:13,594
Meet me at the fucking switch!

1690
02:08:17,682 --> 02:08:20,026
They ain't looking for fucking cops.

1691
02:08:20,393 --> 02:08:22,236
I'm gonna roll out the front...

1692
02:08:22,395 --> 02:08:26,241
...the two of youse beat it out
the side in the fucking cop uniforms.

1693
02:08:27,150 --> 02:08:29,152
The whole fucking force
is out there, kid.

1694
02:08:29,318 --> 02:08:31,571
You know I can take a pinch.

1695
02:08:31,904 --> 02:08:35,158
Don't worry about it.
I'll only give them your first name.

1696
02:09:06,355 --> 02:09:07,948
Clear.

1697
02:09:12,737 --> 02:09:14,455
Okay, go.

1698
02:09:15,281 --> 02:09:16,783
Move, move.

1699
02:09:23,122 --> 02:09:25,295
Hey, don't move. Don't move.

1700
02:09:26,292 --> 02:09:29,045
-Put your weapons down.
-Fuck you. Boston P.D.

1701
02:09:29,212 --> 02:09:32,261
Look out, coming through.
Stand down, Stand down.

1702
02:09:32,423 --> 02:09:33,720
See you in Florida, kid.

1703
02:09:34,300 --> 02:09:36,394
See you when you get back.

1704
02:09:36,719 --> 02:09:38,221
All right. Go.

1705
02:09:38,387 --> 02:09:42,017
All right, guys, let's back up.
Feds got this.

1706
02:09:44,894 --> 02:09:46,396
Hey. Hey.

1707
02:09:46,562 --> 02:09:48,314
You B.P.D. need to fuck off.

1708
02:09:48,481 --> 02:09:50,779
What are you doing?
It's an FBI crime scene.

1709
02:09:50,942 --> 02:09:52,535
Don't put your hand up to me, Go.

1710
02:09:52,693 --> 02:09:54,411
Jurisdiction, guys. Walk away.

1711
02:09:54,570 --> 02:09:55,742
That's my kill.

1712
02:10:09,502 --> 02:10:11,596
I don't know if we're dealing with...

1713
02:10:11,754 --> 02:10:14,177
...some high level of genius here
with security...

1714
02:10:14,507 --> 02:10:17,351
...but security's saying
they got hit by cops.

1715
02:10:17,843 --> 02:10:19,095
Cops?

1716
02:10:19,262 --> 02:10:22,266
Yeah. Two cops, they said.

1717
02:10:36,570 --> 02:10:37,867
Hold up.

1718
02:10:38,155 --> 02:10:39,202
Where you going?

1719
02:10:40,241 --> 02:10:41,288
Pull up here.

1720
02:10:54,547 --> 02:10:56,641
Officer, can you hold up a minute?

1721
02:11:06,183 --> 02:11:09,733
Visual on Coughlin,
heading south toward Boylston.

1722
02:11:09,895 --> 02:11:11,772
Hotel parking lot on Van Ness.

1723
02:11:11,939 --> 02:11:13,737
He's dressed as B.P.D.

1724
02:11:14,191 --> 02:11:15,317
Copy.

1725
02:11:15,484 --> 02:11:17,031
Officer.

1726
02:11:18,904 --> 02:11:20,406
Coughlin.

1727
02:11:59,195 --> 02:12:00,868
Drop your weapon!

1728
02:12:02,698 --> 02:12:04,291
No!

1729
02:12:06,369 --> 02:12:08,042
Move! Move!

1730
02:12:32,812 --> 02:12:35,361
Coughlin, throw down your weapon.

1731
02:12:37,608 --> 02:12:39,406
Fuck you.

1732
02:12:39,902 --> 02:12:41,495
Let me see those hands, right now.

1733
02:12:41,654 --> 02:12:43,247
Fuck you!

1734
02:12:50,621 --> 02:12:52,339
Move, move.

1735
02:12:53,541 --> 02:12:55,259
You got 30 seconds, asshole.

1736
02:13:23,988 --> 02:13:25,365
Okay.

1737
02:13:25,531 --> 02:13:27,283
I surrender.

1738
02:13:27,575 --> 02:13:29,043
I surrender.

1739
02:14:30,763 --> 02:14:33,391
Rusty, something went wrong.

1740
02:14:33,557 --> 02:14:34,729
Come here.

1741
02:14:45,861 --> 02:14:47,238
Fergie.

1742
02:14:48,280 --> 02:14:49,281
Prick.

1743
02:15:20,354 --> 02:15:21,947
Fergie...

1744
02:15:22,648 --> 02:15:24,992
...remember who clipped your nuts
for you.

1745
02:15:25,150 --> 02:15:26,151
GUNSHOT

1746
02:15:26,318 --> 02:15:30,323
I came in hot, saw the suspect run
across the street with a Tec-9.

1747
02:15:30,489 --> 02:15:35,165
I lit up the tires, I jumped out of the cruiser,
engaged the suspect in gunfire.

1748
02:15:36,203 --> 02:15:37,204
So that's when...

1749
02:15:37,371 --> 02:15:39,169
-...you get out of your cruiser.
-Yeah.

1750
02:15:39,331 --> 02:15:42,926
At that point, I fired, struck the suspect
at least once or twice.

1751
02:15:43,085 --> 02:15:44,211
Hey.

1752
02:15:44,503 --> 02:15:46,096
Multiple victims down.

1753
02:15:46,255 --> 02:15:48,053
Location, 529 Main Street, Charlestown.

1754
02:15:48,215 --> 02:15:50,684
-Uniformed officers on the scene.
-That's the Florist.

1755
02:15:50,843 --> 02:15:52,390
Hey, Bobby, Bobby, what happened?

1756
02:15:52,553 --> 02:15:54,180
Somebody got Fergie.

1757
02:15:55,889 --> 02:15:57,937
-Jesus Christ, that's gotta be MacRay.
-Fuck.

1758
02:16:04,815 --> 02:16:07,193
Claire, it's me.

1759
02:16:07,484 --> 02:16:08,531
Are you okay?

1760
02:16:09,528 --> 02:16:10,529
I'll be fine. I know.

1761
02:16:10,696 --> 02:16:13,165
But I'm okay. I'm all right.

1762
02:16:13,324 --> 02:16:15,076
Claire, I wanna meet you.

1763
02:16:16,702 --> 02:16:20,047
It's gotta be soon.
I don't have a lot of time.

1764
02:16:21,540 --> 02:16:23,042
Can you meet me?

1765
02:16:24,043 --> 02:16:25,215
Claire, please.

1766
02:16:26,045 --> 02:16:28,468
I need to know. I gotta go.

1767
02:16:29,506 --> 02:16:31,224
Can you come here?

1768
02:16:37,222 --> 02:16:39,270
You want me
to come where you are now?

1769
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:40,817
Mm-hm.

1770
02:16:44,730 --> 02:16:47,233
I don't think
that's a good idea for me.

1771
02:16:51,028 --> 02:16:52,245
Why?

1772
02:16:57,576 --> 02:16:59,374
What if there are police there?

1773
02:17:01,413 --> 02:17:03,006
There's no one here.

1774
02:17:08,754 --> 02:17:11,678
All right, well, if you think I should
probably come by there...

1775
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:14,263
...then I guess that's what I'll do. Yeah.

1776
02:17:15,761 --> 02:17:16,933
Okay.

1777
02:17:18,430 --> 02:17:21,229
Claire, listen, I'm--
Listen. Listen to me.

1778
02:17:23,394 --> 02:17:24,896
I'm sorry, okay?

1779
02:17:26,313 --> 02:17:28,532
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

1780
02:17:29,942 --> 02:17:31,285
Remember that.

1781
02:17:31,985 --> 02:17:34,955
Come down in the back
and let me in in about an hour:

1782
02:17:37,783 --> 02:17:39,251
All right?

1783
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:42,747
I'll see you.

1784
02:17:44,164 --> 02:17:45,962
Wait, Doug? Doug?

1785
02:17:47,084 --> 02:17:48,552
-Yeah.
-I want you to come.

1786
02:17:48,711 --> 02:17:51,635
I really wanna see you.

1787
02:17:56,343 --> 02:17:59,313
It'll be just like one of my sunny days.

1788
02:18:11,608 --> 02:18:12,825
Well...

1789
02:18:14,987 --> 02:18:16,660
...I'm on my way then.

1790
02:18:19,491 --> 02:18:20,492
Bye.

1791
02:18:24,163 --> 02:18:26,086
Goodbye, Claire.

1792
02:18:32,212 --> 02:18:34,431
All right,
I'd say we've done our part here.

1793
02:18:34,590 --> 02:18:37,218
You know what? Not now.

1794
02:18:43,182 --> 02:18:46,026
He says he's coming, I want people
at Logan, South Station...

1795
02:18:46,185 --> 02:18:48,563
...downtown, Greyhound,
subway, everything. Now.

1796
02:18:48,729 --> 02:18:50,982
-The city's covered.
-Good.

1797
02:19:13,754 --> 02:19:16,507
We 're secure, and everything 's ready.

1798
02:19:22,763 --> 02:19:26,734
-Sir, we need you to stay off the street.
-Just going to work. No problem.

1799
02:19:42,908 --> 02:19:44,660
-How long?
-Forty minutes.

1800
02:19:45,160 --> 02:19:47,037
-Alleyway clear?
-Yes, sir.

1801
02:20:00,551 --> 02:20:03,646
We got nothing.
Still no movement in the alley. Over.

1802
02:20:05,013 --> 02:20:08,267
Well, I guess he didn't have as big a thing
for you as you thought.

1803
02:20:10,018 --> 02:20:11,861
I guess not.

1804
02:20:33,667 --> 02:20:35,260
"My sunny days."

1805
02:20:42,843 --> 02:20:45,642
You know, Claire,
we are a national organization.

1806
02:20:53,687 --> 02:20:56,782
All right, boys, let's pack it up.
He ain't coming.

1807
02:20:56,940 --> 02:20:59,409
Let's get the description out.
Let's go.

1808
02:20:59,651 --> 02:21:01,494
We know what he looks like.

1809
02:21:02,529 --> 02:21:03,872
Let's go find him.

1810
02:21:07,492 --> 02:21:08,618
All right. You good?

1811
02:21:08,785 --> 02:21:10,583
Hey, best possible outcome, you know.

1812
02:21:10,746 --> 02:21:12,669
Well done, well done.

1813
02:21:50,452 --> 02:21:51,920
It's for you.

1814
02:22:57,269 --> 02:23:00,694
Claire, take this.

1815
02:23:00,981 --> 02:23:03,609
You'll do better with it than I can.

1816
02:23:04,234 --> 02:23:06,828
By the time you read this,
I'll be long gone.

1817
02:23:06,987 --> 02:23:08,284
Not the way I planned it...

1818
02:23:08,780 --> 02:23:12,830
...but for the first time in my life,
I'm leaving this city.

1819
02:23:25,422 --> 02:23:26,469
Maybe if I go...

1820
02:23:27,549 --> 02:23:29,176
...I can stop looking.

1821
02:23:51,198 --> 02:23:52,916
No matter how much you change...

1822
02:23:53,075 --> 02:23:55,999
You still have to pay the price
for the things you've done.

1823
02:23:59,164 --> 02:24:01,007
So I got a long road.

1824
02:24:06,671 --> 02:24:09,015
But I know I'll see you again.

1825
02:24:14,846 --> 02:24:16,848
This side or the other.
