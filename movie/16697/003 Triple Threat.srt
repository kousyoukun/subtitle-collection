1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,970
Right now we're going to talk about the triple threat.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:12,590
When you haven't used your dribble yet there's three things you can do off the triple threat.

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:25,980
First is to shoot second is to pass and the third is to dribble so what you first want to think of when

4
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,850
you're in this position is being strong with the ball.

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,680
You gotta make sure you have a strong grip so the defender doesn't strip the ball away from it.

6
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:44,040
And why things you can do is you could also pivot off the triple date if you want to move around with

7
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,620
the ball so you won't have that strong grip you will move around.

8
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,270
See I still have my pivot foot here and my job step here.

9
00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:00,450
So you move you move around where you're pivot and you want to make sure you're always facing the basket

10
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,220
and looking at the whole court at the same time with your peripheral vision.

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,310
So and where you want to play some more is at the hit.

12
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,420
So when you do get a pass you're ready to shoot.

13
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,840
When you're in trouble the position is ready to shoot you really a pass.

14
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,810
You really dribble off the triple threat.

15
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:32,110
And you could also swing the ball around going low like this going from hip to hit or going up here

16
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,810
shoulder shoulder.

17
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:44,260
So these are just ways you can just move around to make a pass to make trouble or to just shoot and

18
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,270
that is that.
