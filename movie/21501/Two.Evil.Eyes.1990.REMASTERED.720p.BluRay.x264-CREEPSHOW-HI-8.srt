[singing continues]

00:01:44,863 --> 00:01:47,196
[woman] Is that an accusation,
Mr. Pike?

10
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:50,483
Is that some sort of
an accusation?

11
00:01:53,538 --> 00:01:55,825
Is that some sort of
an accusation, Mr. Pike?

12
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:59,408
- [man] What'd you say?
- Nothing. Nothing.

13
00:01:59,502 --> 00:02:02,495
- I thought you said something.
- No.

14
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:06,298
I was just talking to myself.
It's nothing.

15
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,277
[clock ticking]

16
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:42,668
He's liquidating a substantial
number of his assets here.

17
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:48,883
This represents 15,
possibly 20 percent of his holdings.

18
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:53,178
I wouldn't know. Ernie has never talked
to me much about business.

19
00:02:53,264 --> 00:02:55,256
Perhaps if he'd be willing
to wait until...

20
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,012
He can't wait, Mr. Pike.

21
00:02:57,102 --> 00:03:00,891
The doctors give him three weeks.
Six at the most.

22
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:03,731
Ernie wants this done now.

23
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,275
With all the proceeds going to you.

24
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:09,069
- That's right.
- Bad timing.

25
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:13,149
The market price on some of these stocks
is lower than it's been in years.

26
00:03:14,035 --> 00:03:17,028
Why doesn't he simply put
these assets in your name?

27
00:03:17,122 --> 00:03:21,162
I don't need assets, Mr. Pike.
I need dollars to live on.

28
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:24,915
You've been remembered,
quite generously, in the will.

29
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:28,168
And how long will it take
to settle the estate, Mr. Pike?

30
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,383
Eighteen months. Two years.

31
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:33,631
- Depending on...
- What do I do while I'm waiting?

32
00:03:33,722 --> 00:03:35,384
Take a job as a waitress?

33
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,927
I'm not society, Mr. Pike.

34
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,679
I have nothing of my own.

35
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:44,518
I was a flight attendant
that Ernie brought home off the red-eye...

36
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:48,692
to the shock and dismay of you
and everyone else in this town.

37
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:51,816
I married a rich, old man.

38
00:03:51,906 --> 00:03:55,866
I let him use me...
for pleasure and for show.

39
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:00,454
Now I'm going to let him
pay me for my services.

40
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,499
[clock chiming]

41
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:20,341
This is Ernest's signature?

42
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:22,597
Is that some sort of
an accusation, Mr. Pike?

43
00:04:34,866 --> 00:04:37,279
Hello, Ernie. Yes.

44
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:41,154
Yes. I'm here with Steven Pike.

45
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:45,082
I gave him the papers.
I don't think he likes it very much.

46
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:48,293
- [clock ticking]
- Well...

47
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:50,462
are you sure you're up to it?

48
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,132
All right. I'll put him on.

49
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,762
[ticking continues]

50
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:06,641
- Hello, Ernest.
- [Ernest] <i>Hello, Steven.</i>

51
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,058
How are you feeling?
How's the pain?

52
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:12,017
Are you feeling much pain?

53
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,024
[Ernest] <i>No. No pain.</i>

54
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,448
[Pike] Listen, Ernest.

55
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:20,992
I have these papers here,
the ones you sent.

56
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:22,532
<i>Yes?</i>

57
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,032
Are you sure
you want to do this?

58
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,082
Have you thought this through?

59
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:31,832
<i>Yes. I want to do it,
Steven.</i>

60
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:34,165
<i>I owe it to Jessica.</i>

61
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:36,420
- [man] <i>Hello?</i>
- Yes?

62
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:39,754
<i>- Who is this?</i>
- I'm Steven Pike, Mr. Valdemar's attorney.

63
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:42,340
<i>Bob Hoffman, Mr. Pike.
I'm Ernie's doctor.</i>

64
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:46,017
<i>Look. Is all this really necessary?
Uh, Ernie's...</i>

65
00:05:46,104 --> 00:05:47,845
<i>Well, he needs as much rest
as he can get.</i>

66
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:49,771
<i>So, unless this is
something really urgent...</i>

67
00:05:49,858 --> 00:05:55,570
Well, Ernest is asking me
to do something a bit, uh, unorthodox.

68
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:59,239
Something that's, uh,
very unlike him to do.

69
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:03,945
<i>People with Ernest's prognosis will often
do surprising things, Mr. Pike.</i>

70
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:06,405
<i>I can assure you his mind
is as sharp as ever.</i>

71
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:09,037
I see. I see.
Thank you, Doctor. I...

72
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:11,585
I hope I haven't disturbed him
too much.

73
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,412
<i>I just don't want him agitated.
That's all.</i>

74
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:16,670
<i>- I'm sure you understand.</i>
- [Pike] Yes. Yes, of course. Yes, uh...

75
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,001
- Good-bye, Doctor.
<i>- Good-bye.</i>

76
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,847
I'll prepare the necessary forms

77
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:29,929
and mail them to you
for Ernest's signature.

78
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:32,982
Well, I wouldn't want any delays.
I'll stop by and pick them up.

79
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,023
Tomorrow morning.
They'll be ready, I hope?

80
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:39,605
- They'll be ready.
- Thank you.

81
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,115
Have a nice day, Mr. Pike.

82

- [ticking]
- [machine beeping]

84
00:08:02,824 --> 00:08:05,066
- God, he's still...
- Still under.

85
00:08:06,077 --> 00:08:08,740
Still completely at my command.

- [ticking continues]
- [beeping continues]

87
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,532
- Valdemar.
- [dial tone]

88
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,117
Repeat these words.

89
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:17,912
I want to do it.

90
00:08:18,756 --> 00:08:20,418
I owe it to JJessica.

91
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:24,927
I want to do it.
I owe it to Jessica.

92
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:27,754
- Wake him up.
- [handset settles in cradle]

93
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:31,513
To the pain?
To the realization that he's dying?

94
00:08:32,937 --> 00:08:34,678
He's better off where he is.

95
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:38,563
Besides,

96
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,351
I thought if we let him sleep,

97
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,773
we might be able to have some time,
liquidate a few assets of our own.

98
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:48,655
- Robert! What if he...
- What? What if he hears me?

99
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:50,407
Well, I'm sure he can. Valdemar.

100
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:52,947
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

101
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,663
- I hear you.
- Fascinating.

102
00:08:56,753 --> 00:09:00,372
Somewhere deep in his consciousness
he knows exactly what we're doing to him.

103
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:03,507
But when I wake him,
it'll all disappear.

104
00:09:05,136 --> 00:09:07,002
Like the fragments of a dream.

105
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:08,507
I don't find it fascinating.

106
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:11,347
It's morbid.

107
00:09:13,061 --> 00:09:14,097
Frightening.

108
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,725
- [beeping continues]
- [ticking continues]

109
00:09:17,982 --> 00:09:20,895
I'm not as...
vindictive as you are.

110
00:09:20,985 --> 00:09:22,692
I don't take
any pleasure out of this.

111
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:28,066
He's a ruthless old man who treats people
as if they were possessions.

112
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,277
He spent his life taking whatever
he wanted without a care for anyone else.

113
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,785
He took you away from me.
Vindictive? Yes. Yes, I am vindictive.

114
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,787
He didn't take me.
I went.

115
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,117
He didn't know
I was seeing you.

116
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,065
He doesn't even realize
we knew each other bef...

117
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:45,049
- I want you back, Jess.
- Robert. Please. I can't.

118
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:46,841
Not now. I couldn't.

119
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:50,717
I-I'm having a very
difficult time with this. I...

120
00:09:51,682 --> 00:09:56,677
I need you to try to be sensitive to that,
try to understand how hard this is for me.

121
00:09:57,688 --> 00:10:00,709
- If you want me to go through with it...
- You already have gone through with this.

122
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,349
There's no turning back anymore.

123
00:10:02,443 --> 00:10:05,443
What are you gonna tell Mr. Pike?
"Oh, this has all been a misunderstanding.

124
00:10:05,863 --> 00:10:07,820
I didn't realize my husband
was under hypnosis

125
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,648
when I asked him to sign
the papers."

126
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,109
You won't like it in prison, Jessica.
The food's awful.

127
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,242
And let's call a spade a spade, all right?

128
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:19,496
This was your idea, not mine.
I was willing to wait.

129
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,874
I just wanted us to be together again,
but that wasn't good enough, was it?

130
00:10:22,964 --> 00:10:25,081
Not after you got a taste
of what it was to be rich.

131
00:10:25,174 --> 00:10:27,111
You're going to pretend
you don't care about the money?

132
00:10:27,135 --> 00:10:28,501
No. Of course I want the money,

133
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,007
but I want you too,
and I thought you wanted me.

134
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,213
I do.

135
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,349
Robert, I do. Uh...

136
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:38,518
It's just difficult...

137
00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:41,771
Difficult to care about someone
you know is a thief?

138
00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:44,985
I know.

139
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:47,652
I have the same problem.

140
00:10:56,205 --> 00:10:57,616
- [beeping]
- [ticking stops]

141
00:10:57,707 --> 00:11:01,075
Valdemar.
I'm going to wake you now.

142
00:11:02,336 --> 00:11:03,793
When I count to five,

143
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:07,461
you will be completely awake
and alert.

144
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,759
One.

145
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:12,510
You will not remember anything.

146
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:17,345
Two. You're starting
to regain your senses.

147
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:21,811
Three. Starting to see the room.

148
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:23,514
Starting to see me.

149
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:26,107
Four.

150
00:11:27,028 --> 00:11:30,647
[Ernest] Oh, God! The pain!

151
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,322
[screaming]

152
00:11:32,408 --> 00:11:34,115
God. Can't you help him?

153
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:37,244
He'll be asleep soon.
He's had his injection.

154
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,616
There's not much else I can do.

155
00:11:38,706 --> 00:11:41,949
[sighs] You could stay with him.
That's what you're being paid for.

156
00:11:42,043 --> 00:11:43,909
You should have him in a hospital.

157
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:46,499
A man in his advanced state.

158
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:50,128
Keeping him at home.
I have never seen anything like it.

159
00:11:50,218 --> 00:11:52,881
In all my years of nursing,
I've never seen anything like it.

160
00:11:53,262 --> 00:11:56,255
[Ernest moaning]

161
00:12:03,064 --> 00:12:06,648
[Ernest] Where is
that bitch of a wife of mine?

162
00:12:08,486 --> 00:12:09,897
Where is she?

163
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:13,029
Out spending my money.

164
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:16,866
Where is she? Where...

165
00:12:18,663 --> 00:12:20,029
Jessica!

166
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,326
Jessica!

167
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:28,165
Jessica!

168
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:37,095
Jessica!

169
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:41,016
[TV: loud noises]

170
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:48,022
Two of the money market accounts
are with the local bank.

171
00:12:48,109 --> 00:12:52,194
Those funds are available to you now.
See Mr. Pratt.

172
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:54,897
The rest is going to take some time.

173
00:12:55,783 --> 00:12:58,150
- How much time?
- Paperwork, mails,

174
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,361
out-of-town checks
will have to clear.

175
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:02,446
Two to three weeks.

176
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:09,294
If anything should happen to Ernest,

177
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,747
you'll have a hard time collecting,
I'm afraid.

178
00:13:12,383 --> 00:13:14,545
So do your best to keep him alive,
won't you?

179
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:17,969
- I'll do my best.
- I'm sure you will.

180
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:30,983
This is quite a lot to be walking
around with in cash, Mrs. Valdemar.

181
00:13:31,068 --> 00:13:33,310
Now, we do offer
a liquid asset account

182
00:13:33,404 --> 00:13:35,270
that would allow you
to withdraw any amount...

183
00:13:35,364 --> 00:13:37,026
I'll be wanting to talk
to you about that.

184
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:40,609
I'll be coming into quite a large sum
in the next few weeks.

185
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:42,660
Something over three million,
I'm told.

186
00:13:43,706 --> 00:13:47,540
And, of course, I'll be wanting to put it
someplace where it will be safe.

187
00:13:48,002 --> 00:13:51,712
But this... I have a need
for this in cash.

188
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,754
Whatever you say,
Mrs. Valdemar.

189
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:56,128
Whenever you're ready,
just give me a call.

190
00:13:56,218 --> 00:13:59,006
We're, uh...
We're here to please.

191
00:14:13,944 --> 00:14:15,936
[whirring]

192
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,700
That's good enough, Martha. You can go.

193
00:14:22,787 --> 00:14:25,780
- We've not done the upstairs yet, Mrs. V.
- It doesn't need to be done.

194
00:14:25,873 --> 00:14:28,536
It's fine. Really.
You can get it next time.

195
00:14:28,626 --> 00:14:30,162
If you say so, mum.

196
00:14:30,252 --> 00:14:33,915
All right, people.
Let's pack it up. We're leaving.

197
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:37,124
Mr. V seems in
a bad way today, mum.

198
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,551
Yes. He's, uh, been bad
for some time now.

199
00:14:40,638 --> 00:14:44,473
Poor old soul. Night nurse left,
and I didn't know what to do.

200
00:14:44,558 --> 00:14:46,675
I'm sorry. I didn't expect
to be gone so long.

201
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:49,182
That's all right.
Doctor's with him now.

202
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:51,012
Oh, he's here? Good.

203
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,357
[door closes]

204
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,480
- [machine beeping]
- [ticking]

205
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,655
[Robert] Sign your name, Valdemar.
Sign your name on the line.

206
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,834
Again, Valdemar.

207
00:15:57,965 --> 00:15:59,797
Here. On the line.

208
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:01,753
Sign your name again.

209
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:04,461
[beeping continues]

210
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:21,773
Done.

211
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:23,901
- Is he...
- Still under.

212
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,366
Come here.

213
00:16:29,538 --> 00:16:31,245
Are you sure you want to?

214
00:16:34,001 --> 00:16:35,333
Yes.

215
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,669
What did you put
in the safe, Jesse?

216
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,797
[chuckles]
The safe?

217
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:47,421
When you came in.

218
00:16:48,098 --> 00:16:50,841
I saw you put something
in the safe. What was it?

219
00:16:50,935 --> 00:16:52,176
[Jessica] Money.

220
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:56,436
- You got the money.
- Some.

221
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,983
- Just a little.
- How much is a little?

222
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:05,146
[Jessica] I don't know.
A few thousand.

223
00:17:07,617 --> 00:17:09,575
None of it mine, I suppose.

224
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:12,157
I'll have the rest in
a few weeks.

225
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:14,830
Oh. Nothing for me
until the job is finished.

226
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,954
- Is that it?
- [chuckles]

227
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:18,993
That's not fair.

228
00:17:20,297 --> 00:17:22,880
I haven't gotten anything
out of this, Jess.

229
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:24,252
Soon.

230
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:26,797
In a few weeks.

231
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:29,963
In a few weeks we'll have it all.

232
00:17:31,141 --> 00:17:33,633
Just think of it.
A million dollars.

233
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:37,642
A million dollars
for us to share.

234
00:17:43,153 --> 00:17:44,985
Mine in cash.
Remember?

235
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:48,360
No checks.

236
00:17:49,577 --> 00:17:52,866
- Nothing with my name on it.
- Ah, don't worry.

237
00:17:53,622 --> 00:17:57,081
- Nothing to connect us.
- There's nothing to connect us.

238
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:00,877
Nothing at all to connect us.

239
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,207
[machine beeping]

240
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,261
It's Ernest.

241
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:23,020
[steady beep]

242
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,950
Oh, my God.

243
00:18:40,044 --> 00:18:42,878
- [steady EKG beep continues]
- [machines beeping erratically]

244
00:18:52,056 --> 00:18:54,343
[beeping continues]

245
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,074
Keep him alive for a few more weeks.
That's what Pike said you had to do.

246
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:18,572
That's what we're going to do.
No one needs to know he died here tonight.

247
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:25,044
We wait till the money comes through.
Then he dies a few days later.

248
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:33,924
Won't he have to be examined?

249
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:39,058
By a doctor. That's me.
I'll sign the death certificate.

250
00:19:40,521 --> 00:19:43,013
- What about the funeral?
- Closed coffin.

251
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,146
- Cremation.
- We can't just do that ourselves.

252
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:49,569
No. State law.
It has to be someone licensed.

253
00:19:50,364 --> 00:19:51,946
We don't have to have him embalmed,

254
00:19:52,783 --> 00:19:55,150
but the body does have
to be handled.

255
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:57,744
In three weeks he'll be...

256
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,287
Yes. He'll be melted.

257
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:03,042
Unless...

258
00:20:07,256 --> 00:20:08,337
In your basement.

259
00:20:10,718 --> 00:20:12,129
You can't be serious.

260
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:15,254
How badly do you want this, Jess?

261
00:20:22,646 --> 00:20:23,853
[water trickling]

262
00:20:48,672 --> 00:20:50,254
Oh, God.

263
00:20:54,136 --> 00:20:57,675
Jess, give me a hand. You gotta
give me a hand here, Jess.

264
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,181
Try to free the arm.

265
00:21:00,267 --> 00:21:02,224
Get the arm off
the banister there.

266
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:08,056
Jesse, for God's sake,
I'm losing him!

267
00:21:17,618 --> 00:21:19,450
- [doorbell rings]
- [Jessica whimpers]

[grunting]

269
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:26,453
It's the nurse.

270
00:21:28,962 --> 00:21:30,498
- Answer it.
- No.

271
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,193
If you don't answer it, she'll be
bugging us all night. Get rid of her.

272
00:21:33,217 --> 00:21:34,503
[doorbell ringing]

[doorbell rings]

274
00:21:45,687 --> 00:21:50,523
Uh, I... I should have called you.
I'm sorry. Uh, I won't be needing you.

275
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:53,526
[sighs] I came all this way.

276
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,812
- I'm gonna have to charge you for my time.
- [thumping]

277
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,407
Will you be wanting me tomorrow?

278
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:02,151
No. Uh...

279
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:05,868
Actually, I have decided
to take your advice.

280
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,792
I-I'm... I'm putting Mr. Valdemar
into a hospital.

281
00:22:09,378 --> 00:22:12,371
- I won't be needing you anymore.
- Well, it is about time.

282
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,171
A man in his advanced state.

283
00:22:14,842 --> 00:22:17,505
I'm here. I would be happy
to look in on him.

284
00:22:17,594 --> 00:22:20,257
[Jessica] Uh, no. Uh, the doctor's
with him right now.

285
00:22:20,347 --> 00:22:22,930
Well, I'm sorry to lose the work,

286
00:22:23,016 --> 00:22:26,384
but I am glad to see that you are
finally doing the right thing.

287
00:22:26,854 --> 00:22:28,971
I'll see that they send you
an adjusted bill.

288
00:22:29,064 --> 00:22:30,396
- Good night.
- Good night.

289
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,724
Thank you... for all your help.

290
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:36,940
[exhales deeply]

[crickets chirping]

292
00:22:59,636 --> 00:23:01,502
What if we need more signatures?

293
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,925
[Robert] I've done enough.
You can do the forging.

294
00:23:11,148 --> 00:23:13,140
You better practice,
just in case.

295
00:23:15,068 --> 00:23:18,061
What if Pike calls,
wants to talk to him?

296
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,067
No phone calls.
Doctor's orders.

297
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,950
- What if he comes to the house?
- He won't.

298
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,765
He gives you a hard time, but underneath
it all, he doesn't give a shit.

299
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:30,372
As long as he gets his fees,
that's all he cares about.

300
00:23:31,001 --> 00:23:33,288
That's all anybody
ever cares about in the end.

301
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,372
- Money.
- Yeah.

302
00:23:38,008 --> 00:23:39,499
Has a way, doesn't it?

303
00:23:48,936 --> 00:23:53,101
All taken care of:
400,000 in a liquid asset account.

304
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,058
There's your checkbook.
And...

305
00:23:56,777 --> 00:23:59,110
another 100,000 for you here.

306
00:24:01,031 --> 00:24:05,025
Do you mind if I ask what use
you could possibly have for all this cash?

307
00:24:05,118 --> 00:24:07,485
I do mind, Mr. Pratt.
It's private business.

[sighs] You scared
the hell out of me.

315
00:25:45,135 --> 00:25:48,924
- What are you doing down here?
- I... I thought I heard something.

316
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,051
It sounded...

317
00:25:52,976 --> 00:25:54,558
It sounded like Ernest.

318
00:25:56,396 --> 00:25:58,433
Come on. Come away from there.

319
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,105
Stay with me tonight.

320
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,020
- Jess, you gotta get a hold of yourself.
- Robert, please.

321
00:26:11,078 --> 00:26:15,072
I can't be alone here anymore.
I can't stand being alone here.

322
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:20,206
- All right. I'll stay.
- [siren wailing in distance]

323
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:35,091
You're not gonna freak out on me,
are you?

324
00:26:35,185 --> 00:26:37,097
You're gonna be able
to get through this.

325
00:26:37,187 --> 00:26:39,179
Because if you're not,
tell me now,

326
00:26:39,856 --> 00:26:42,269
so I can pull out
and start covering my tracks.

327
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:46,319
He said, in his typically kind
and understanding way.

328
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:50,489
I am sorry, Robert,
if I am not strong enough for you.

329
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:54,114
I didn't go to medical school. I haven't
spent a lot of time around cadavers.

330
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:23,686
[metronome ticking]

331
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:26,896
What are you doing?

332
00:27:27,696 --> 00:27:29,813
I'm going to sleep.
You should do the same.

333
00:27:30,657 --> 00:27:32,176
I can give you something, if you like.

334
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,783
God, no. After all that gin, you'd drop.

335
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:39,618
I should teach you how to do this.
Self-hypnosis. It's better than any pill.

336
00:27:40,834 --> 00:27:42,270
You know, you won't be able
to wake me.

337
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:46,163
So if you think you might change your mind
and want to mess around...

338
00:27:46,256 --> 00:27:48,748
- I won't be able to wake you?
- When you're hypnotized,

339
00:27:48,842 --> 00:27:51,334
you can only be wakened
by the voice that put you under.

340
00:27:52,095 --> 00:27:54,031
When you hypnotize yourself,
there's no such voice.

341
00:27:54,055 --> 00:27:56,968
- I need to have you with me.
- I am with you.

342
00:27:57,058 --> 00:27:59,095
[scoffs] If I can't wake you...

343
00:27:59,186 --> 00:28:01,269
I have got to get some sleep.

344
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:05,060
I have an early appointment.
I've been neglecting my practice.

345
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,142
You're not the only one
that's strung out, Jess.

346
00:28:07,235 --> 00:28:10,603
The last few weeks haven't exactly
been a vacation for me either.

347
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:14,907
I'm here. I'm with you.
Nothing is gonna happen.

[ticking continues]

349
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,907
I'm just gonna sleep
for a few hours.

350
00:28:46,066 --> 00:28:47,182

He's still alive.

373
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,228
Here. Here. Take a look at him.
See for yourself.

374
00:31:40,657 --> 00:31:42,614
Come down here,
Jessica, and look at him.

375
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,239
Just take one look at him,
then tell me you think he's still alive.

376
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:47,365
I can't.

Are you there?

381
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:11,056
[Ernest] Yes.

382
00:32:18,945 --> 00:32:23,531
Valdemar, uh,
are you still, uh...

383
00:32:23,616 --> 00:32:25,699
[Ernest] Sleeping.

384
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,486
Sleeping?

385
00:32:28,997 --> 00:32:30,579
[Ernest] Yes.

386
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:33,370
No.

387
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,999
I have been sleeping,

388
00:32:37,964 --> 00:32:39,580
and now...

389
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:43,589
I am dead.

390
00:32:43,678 --> 00:32:46,216
Oh, Mother of God.

391
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:52,096
[Robert] Valdemar.

392
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:00,727
Valdemar.

393
00:33:04,657 --> 00:33:06,239
Valdemar, can you hear me?

394
00:33:15,001 --> 00:33:16,993
[footsteps approaching]

395
00:33:18,671 --> 00:33:21,539
Nothing. Over an hour,
and nothing more.

396
00:33:22,509 --> 00:33:26,253
It's a trick.
It... It's a recorded voice.

397
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:29,676
- Someone's doing this to us. Pike.
- Oh, please.

398
00:33:29,766 --> 00:33:32,679
- It's either that, or he's still alive.
- He's dead, Jessica.

399
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:35,682
There's no vital signs.
He's frozen solid, for Christ's sake.

400
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:40,562
I don't know. I mean,
I don't know what's going on here.

401
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:44,987
All I can think is that he was
hypnotized when he died, so...

402
00:33:45,073 --> 00:33:48,237
somehow we're still able
to communicate with him.

403
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,785
It seems impossible, but...

404
00:33:52,747 --> 00:33:55,239
there's no other explanation
that makes any sense.

405
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,581
Here. Here.

406
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:06,167
Take two of these now,
and take another at 11:00.

407
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:07,627
And lay off the liquor.

408
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:12,130
- You're not leaving.
- I have to.

409
00:34:12,225 --> 00:34:13,806
Robert, you can't.

410
00:34:13,893 --> 00:34:16,260
I have an endoscopy at 8:00.

411
00:34:16,353 --> 00:34:19,250
They're prepping the patient right now.
I've canceled this guy three times.

412
00:34:19,274 --> 00:34:20,560
You can't do this to me.

413
00:34:22,735 --> 00:34:24,772
We are felons, Jessica.

414
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:26,853
We have committed
grand larceny here

415
00:34:26,947 --> 00:34:30,112
and fraud and God knows what else.

416
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,784
The last thing we need to do
is to arouse suspicion.

417
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,533
We have to maintain
an air of, uh...

418
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,531
An air of normality?

419
00:34:40,837 --> 00:34:43,123
[sighs] Look.

420
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,877
Uh, I'll leave early.
I'll be back here by 2:30.

421
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:49,380
You don't have to stay in the house.
Go outside. Get some air.

422
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:51,928
Take the pills,
and calm yourself.

423
00:34:53,474 --> 00:34:55,010
Take the pills, Jessica.

424
00:35:03,484 --> 00:35:05,066
No booze, Jessica.

425
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,240
Here.

426
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,865
Let me see you take 'em.

427
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:27,589
I'm terrified.

428
00:35:30,803 --> 00:35:32,339
I know...

429
00:35:33,222 --> 00:35:34,429
I'm sorry.

430
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,469
I shouldn't be so, uh...

431
00:35:43,983 --> 00:35:45,224
We'll be all right.

432
00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:48,151
Just try to think logically.

433
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,443
There's a logical explanation
for everything.

434
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:57,486
There's a logical explanation
for everything.

Can you see anything?
Can you...

451
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:17,734
- tell me what you see?
- [Ernest] Lights.

452

Very bright.

453
00:37:21,247 --> 00:37:22,863
Very far...

00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,540
in the distance.

455
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,702
Can't reach them.

456
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,873
Where I am, it is dark.

457
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:37,177
Dark. Cold.

458
00:37:38,765 --> 00:37:41,599
Very cold.

459
00:37:43,144 --> 00:37:46,637
Help me, Jessica!

460
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,017
God.

461
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,851
- Jesse?
- No. No...

462
00:37:51,944 --> 00:37:54,607
Christ. Don't go
spooking around like that.

[Ernest] Others.

464
00:38:01,454 --> 00:38:03,992
There are others.

- Others?
- [Ernest] Many...

466

many others.

467
00:38:12,965 --> 00:38:14,922
Looking at me.

468
00:38:15,718 --> 00:38:17,425
Watching me.

469
00:38:18,554 --> 00:38:21,262
They want something.

470
00:38:23,142 --> 00:38:24,849
These, uh, others...

471
00:38:25,394 --> 00:38:26,805
can you see them?

472
00:38:27,396 --> 00:38:30,935
What do they look like?
Who are they?

Hit it.

638
00:53:28,964 --> 00:53:30,080
Hoffman?

639
00:54:10,297 --> 00:54:13,961
What'd I tell you? Another rich guy.
Call in the troops.

[Robert] Help.

643
00:54:43,371 --> 00:54:46,159
There's no one to wake me.

644
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:49,951
No one to wake me.

645

any chance of me being transferred

[O'Neill]
No, sir. I was asking about a transfer.

659
00:55:47,978 --> 00:55:52,018
- Out. Oh, I'm real impressed. Out.
- [man] This is a pass to come in here.

660
00:55:52,107 --> 00:55:53,835
- Can you read English?
- [man 2] I can read English.

661
00:55:53,859 --> 00:55:56,087
I can read any language you want.
You don't come in with one of those.

662
00:55:56,111 --> 00:55:58,068
I want the police!
I want to see the police!

[detective] What's the matter, Rod? You
having a little problem with the bouncer?

You trying to get somebody killed?
Somebody stop this thing.

- [meows]
- Did you scratch him?

695
00:58:14,833 --> 00:58:17,041
You mustn't do that.
He's very fragile.

696
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:19,961
- Where did she come from?
- She's ours.

697

I found her outside.

698

You were so hungry, weren't you?
But I'll take care of you.

Isn't she pretty?

700

We can keep her, can't we?

00:58:38,565 --> 00:58:39,726
Sure, honey.

704
00:58:40,233 --> 00:58:41,233
Good.

- [woman] My brave lover.

Yeah, well, what if it decides to jump up
here in the middle of the night

I see a lot of terrible things
in my work. You don't know.

717
01:00:40,019 --> 01:00:41,601
You're superstitious.

718
01:00:43,481 --> 01:00:45,188
I think it's 'cause she's
a black cat.

719
01:00:48,486 --> 01:00:51,729
You know where those superstitions began,
don't you? It was in the Middle Ages.

720
01:00:53,825 --> 01:00:57,614
Inquisitors burned women and black cats
'cause they thought they were witches.

721
01:00:57,704 --> 01:01:00,071
Finally, there weren't
many black cats left.

I accidentally caught her tail
in the door.

745
01:04:18,738 --> 01:04:20,946
She's all right.
By the way, what's her name?

746
01:04:21,949 --> 01:04:22,985
It's a secret.

No, I... The crime photos are terrific.
They're startling.

I... I'm just saying contrast.
Contrast, that's all I'm saying.

But there's contrast here.

Rod, look. You know what
I'm talking about here.

Now, shots with the same tone,
but something other than crime photos.

No, he hasn't checked in yet.

Okay, I'll take care of it.

Hi, Anne.

No, I haven't heard anything at all.
I'm frantic about it.

I will. Thank you.

Don't you think this is

I don't have a child.

01:30:28,097 --> 01:30:29,963
It's Annabel.
We had an argument,

01:30:30,058 --> 01:30:33,426
and she locked herself
upstairs in her room.

I don't know about any argument.
We just want to sleep.

Of course. I'm sorry.
I'll tell her.

Didn't you say that your wife
was up in her room?

What's all this?

I didn't... didn't realize it.
Oh. Oh.

- Yeah.

Not today.
We're leaving.

Leaving? But Annabel told me
I had a lesson...

1025
01:32:24,088 --> 01:32:27,126
She must have made a mistake.
We're going on a vacation.

- Well, can I at least say good-bye?

Oh, for me? Oh, how sweet.

You know how it is.
We had an argument. Pfft.

01:33:38,037 --> 01:33:40,620
- Oh, nothing serious, I hope.
- No.

1037
01:33:41,707 --> 01:33:44,144
As a matter of fact, we're going away
for a week to be alone together.

1038
01:33:44,168 --> 01:33:49,129
Oh, that'll be so nice. Annabel needs it.
She's been kind of gloomy

1039
01:33:49,215 --> 01:33:51,693
- ever since her cat disappeared.
- So we'll see you next week.

Say good-bye to Mr. Pym for me.

Listen, asshole. You better listen to me.

1090

Don't you ever
call this house again. Ever!

You hear me?

- That's strange.
- What?

1093
01:39:49,074 --> 01:39:52,074
Well, you think if she'd have gone
on tour, she would have taken her violin.

1094
01:39:54,830 --> 01:39:56,162
She has two.

1095
01:39:57,416 --> 01:39:59,936
Look, I heard what you were saying
to that guy on the telephone.

- I mean, if...
- What do you want?

1097
01:40:02,379 --> 01:40:04,939
You don't know anything,
so why don't you mind your own business.

1098
01:40:08,344 --> 01:40:09,835
And don't come back.

1099

Oh, Mr. Usher.

1100

- You're back.
- Just me.

1101
01:40:16,519 --> 01:40:18,226
Yeah, Annabel went on tour,

1102
01:40:18,312 --> 01:40:20,975
only she didn't take her violin
and she never got there.

1103
01:40:21,941 --> 01:40:25,059
Well, uh,
will she be away long?

1104
01:40:25,152 --> 01:40:28,236
Two or three months.
If they want her longer, who knows.

1105
01:40:28,322 --> 01:40:30,484
Don't listen to this guy.
He's a damned liar.

1106
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:35,114
Well, I'll miss her. Your wife
and I love to talk together.

- You mean Annabel?
- Yes.

- She's not my wife.
- Oh? I-I thought...

1109
01:40:43,212 --> 01:40:45,532
We've lived together for four years,
but we're not married.

01:40:46,090 --> 01:40:47,090
Oh.

01:40:47,174 --> 01:40:50,918
Well, uh, come on, Gloria.
Excuse us.

1112
01:40:51,011 --> 01:40:52,218
Don't worry about it.

1113
01:40:55,516 --> 01:40:56,882
And you, stay away.

1114
01:40:57,977 --> 01:40:59,218
You're lying, man.

1115
01:41:04,650 --> 01:41:05,686
You're lying!

1116
01:41:07,611 --> 01:41:08,611
He's lying!

1117
01:41:10,489 --> 01:41:11,855
He knows where she is.

1118
01:41:27,631 --> 01:41:30,419
[object rattling]

1119
01:41:34,847 --> 01:41:37,840
[rattling continues]

1120
01:41:49,028 --> 01:41:50,940
[phone rings]

01:41:53,991 --> 01:41:56,404
[scratching]

1122
01:41:59,288 --> 01:42:01,029
[scratching continues]

1123
01:42:05,461 --> 01:42:07,794
[phone rings]

1124
01:42:15,346 --> 01:42:17,303
I told you not to call back.

1125
01:42:26,690 --> 01:42:28,852
[scratching continues]

1126
01:42:51,507 --> 01:42:54,341
[scratching continues louder]

1127
01:43:06,271 --> 01:43:08,711
[Usher] <i>Must have gotten inside
while I was building the wall.</i>

1128
01:43:10,567 --> 01:43:11,774
[screeches]

1129
01:43:17,116 --> 01:43:19,699
[screeching continues]

1130
01:43:27,668 --> 01:43:29,910
[loud screeching]

1131
01:43:49,857 --> 01:43:52,395
Mr. Usher. Hi.

1132
01:43:53,277 --> 01:43:54,984
My name's Father Hammer.
I'm your neighbor.

1133
01:43:55,070 --> 01:43:56,070
Hello.

1134
01:43:58,157 --> 01:44:00,740
- It's leaking.
- Yeah, it's blood.

1135
01:44:00,826 --> 01:44:02,783
- [Hammer] Oh.
- [Usher] It's a rat.

1136
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:06,454
- A big rat.
- Where did it come from?

1137
01:44:07,541 --> 01:44:09,703
It got into my house,
and I had to kill it.

1138
01:44:10,502 --> 01:44:14,371
Huge. I stabbed it a few times,
but, uh, it wouldn't die.

1139
01:44:14,465 --> 01:44:16,206
So I had to keep on stabbing it.

1140
01:44:17,593 --> 01:44:19,801
- You wanna take a look?
- No. Uh, thanks.

1141
01:44:19,887 --> 01:44:22,425
- I... I can't stand rats.
- [laughs]

1142
01:44:22,514 --> 01:44:23,880
I understand.

1143
01:45:03,263 --> 01:45:06,097
[no audible dialogue]

1144
01:45:09,144 --> 01:45:10,260
[Usher] "Murder."

1145
01:45:14,525 --> 01:45:15,936
Let him talk.

1146
01:45:21,490 --> 01:45:25,279
[doorbell ringing]

1147
01:45:32,793 --> 01:45:35,035
- [detective] Surprised?
- [Usher] Not really.

1148
01:45:35,128 --> 01:45:38,872
Not really? [laughs]

1149
01:45:38,966 --> 01:45:41,834
False accusations
are like the wind.

1150
01:45:43,595 --> 01:45:48,135
- At least I'm lucky they sent you.
- Yeah. Well, we'll see how lucky you are.

1151
01:45:48,225 --> 01:45:51,184
You know, Rod, they mentioned your name
down at the precinct, and I said,

1152
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:55,731
- "I know that guy. He's an artiste."
- [laughs]

1153
01:45:55,816 --> 01:45:58,058
Let's not stand on ceremony.
Have a seat.

1154
01:45:58,151 --> 01:46:02,646
Oh, we like standing.
But we prefer walking. Check it out.

1155
01:46:05,576 --> 01:46:07,192
[rustling]

1156
01:46:07,286 --> 01:46:11,246
[sighs] I haven't had breakfast yet,
and I've got a lot of errands to run.

1157
01:46:11,331 --> 01:46:13,618
Hmm. Well, we won't be long.

1158
01:46:15,586 --> 01:46:17,202
[clicking phone cradle]

1159
01:46:19,298 --> 01:46:20,960
- Phone's unplugged.
- Oh.

1160
01:46:22,634 --> 01:46:26,048
There have been a lot of kook
calls since the book came out.

1161
01:46:26,138 --> 01:46:28,300
- Amateur photographers.
- [sneezes]

1162
01:46:28,390 --> 01:46:31,258
- God bless you.
- Is there a cat in here?

1163
01:46:33,353 --> 01:46:37,347
- There was one, but now it's gone.
- And what happened to it?

1164
01:46:38,317 --> 01:46:40,934
Don't tell me you're here
to search for a lost cat.

1165
01:46:41,028 --> 01:46:44,396
[chuckles]
I asked you something.

1166
01:46:44,489 --> 01:46:49,029
It was here for a few days,
and then it disappeared!

1167
01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:53,284
Disappeared, huh? Look,
speaking of disappearance, uh, Rod,

1168
01:46:53,373 --> 01:46:54,830
what happened to your wife?

1169
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:58,041
She's not my wife.

1170
01:46:59,463 --> 01:47:03,628
[detective] Oh, right, right.
What was her name? Uh, Annabel.

1171
01:47:04,343 --> 01:47:07,051
What do you mean "was"?
It's still her name.

1172
01:47:07,971 --> 01:47:10,054
Well, past tense.

1173
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:11,551
It's a bad habit.

1174
01:47:12,225 --> 01:47:15,309
It seems whenever you and I meet,
there's always a body around.

1175
01:47:33,372 --> 01:47:36,035
Okay, tell us where she is,
we'll have breakfast delivered.

1176
01:47:36,124 --> 01:47:38,912
I don't know! If I knew,
I'd tell you.

1177
01:47:44,383 --> 01:47:45,749
She left me.

1178
01:47:47,761 --> 01:47:50,253
We spent a couple
of days up at a lake.

1179
01:47:50,347 --> 01:47:52,179
We couldn't patch things up.

1180
01:47:53,642 --> 01:47:57,602
- She has a sister who lives in...
- No, her sister hasn't heard from her.

1181
01:47:58,981 --> 01:48:00,768
No wonder.
They don't like each other.

1182
01:48:10,242 --> 01:48:11,983
[sneezes] Excuse me.

1183
01:48:12,077 --> 01:48:15,912
That cat of yours must have
left a lot of fur behind, huh?

1184
01:48:18,041 --> 01:48:20,454
Say, this is the cat,
isn't it, Rod?

1185
01:48:23,505 --> 01:48:28,341
You know, Rod, they say that you... you
tortured this cat to get these pictures.

1186
01:48:29,302 --> 01:48:30,964
Now you wouldn't do that,
would you?

1187
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:33,296
Say it isn't so, Rod.

1188
01:48:34,099 --> 01:48:35,260
It isn't so.

1189
01:48:36,059 --> 01:48:37,059
Good.

1190
01:48:37,644 --> 01:48:40,933
My kid has a couple
of little kittens. Loves 'em.

1191
01:48:41,648 --> 01:48:44,140
- Plays with 'em all the time.
- [man] Great, Legrand!

1192
01:48:44,234 --> 01:48:46,087
Have Rod take care of 'em
when you go on vacation.

1193
01:48:46,111 --> 01:48:47,602
[chuckles]

1194
01:48:48,613 --> 01:48:51,105
[phone rings]

1195
01:48:52,492 --> 01:48:54,654
- Hello.
- [Joseph] <i>This is Joseph.</i>

1196
01:48:54,745 --> 01:48:56,407
<i>I called yesterday
from New York.</i>

1197
01:48:58,081 --> 01:48:59,684
[British accent]
You wish to speak with Mr. Usher.

1198
01:48:59,708 --> 01:49:02,121
Sorry, Mr. Usher is not at home.

1199
01:49:02,210 --> 01:49:03,326
[hangs up]

1200
01:49:03,879 --> 01:49:05,523
[normal voice] Pain in the ass
won't leave me alone.

1201
01:49:05,547 --> 01:49:07,254
- Ah.
- Wants some of my pictures.

1202
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:08,660
I have to get an unlisted number.

1203
01:49:08,717 --> 01:49:13,678
Ah. So Annabel and the cat took off, huh?
Didn't say where they were going, though.

1204
01:49:13,764 --> 01:49:16,598
Cats don't talk.
But Annabel left a note.

1205
01:49:17,142 --> 01:49:18,633
It's around here somewhere.

1206
01:49:31,239 --> 01:49:33,697
[chuckles]
Real love letter.

1207
01:49:33,784 --> 01:49:37,152
Why'd you tell the neighbors
that she was going on an orchestra tour?

1208
01:49:37,245 --> 01:49:40,864
I don't have to tell
those busybodies my business.

1209
01:49:40,957 --> 01:49:44,667
True. You got any letters of hers?

1210
01:49:44,753 --> 01:49:47,245
- This is her picture, isn't it?
- Yes.

1211
01:49:47,339 --> 01:49:49,752
- Do you mind if we take it?
- No.

1212
01:49:55,889 --> 01:49:58,973
Oh, and you could give me
the book as a present, huh?

1213
01:50:00,143 --> 01:50:01,143
[Usher] Sure.

1214
01:50:02,604 --> 01:50:05,267
- Thanks, Rod.
- You almost coauthored it with me.

1215
01:50:07,317 --> 01:50:11,607
Oh, one more thing. Um, where'd you
and Annabel go on this vacation of yours?

1216
01:50:11,696 --> 01:50:14,404
To Lake Arthur. I have a dual house
on the shore there.

1217
01:50:14,491 --> 01:50:18,110
Uh-huh. Okay, Rod, thank you.
Let's go.

1218
01:50:27,629 --> 01:50:30,121
Gentlemen, I'm glad
your suspicions have been allayed.

1219
01:50:30,215 --> 01:50:32,081
I wish you a long and happy life.

1220
01:50:33,718 --> 01:50:38,088
And what did you expect to find
between these solidly put-together walls?

1221
01:50:46,273 --> 01:50:48,856
[knocks]

1222
01:50:48,942 --> 01:50:50,683
[Legrand]
Open up. It's me again.

1223
01:50:50,777 --> 01:50:53,064
[knocking]

1224
01:50:56,867 --> 01:50:58,233
You forgot to sign it.

1225
01:51:07,294 --> 01:51:08,330
Ah.

1226
01:51:13,175 --> 01:51:15,292
That's funny. It was working
a minute ago.

1227
01:51:20,348 --> 01:51:22,431
I'm sure you got a pen inside.

1228
01:51:34,571 --> 01:51:36,779
Hey, Rod, I liked
what you said before

1229
01:51:36,865 --> 01:51:39,107
about me almost coauthoring
the book with you.

1230
01:51:39,201 --> 01:51:40,658
Would you sign it like that?

1231
01:51:46,208 --> 01:51:47,324
Yeah.

1232
01:51:49,878 --> 01:51:52,291
[cat screeching]

1233
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:53,621
Where's that coming from?

1234
01:52:03,350 --> 01:52:05,433
[cat screeching]

1235
01:52:28,583 --> 01:52:32,293
[clattering]

1236
01:52:32,379 --> 01:52:34,746
- [shouting] What the fuck are you doing?
- Hold it.

1237
01:52:35,507 --> 01:52:36,793
What do you got?

1238
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:39,337
[clattering stops]

1239
01:52:43,223 --> 01:52:44,259
Boss.

1240
01:53:00,699 --> 01:53:03,737
- It's fresh.
- What'd you say, Rod?

1241
01:53:03,827 --> 01:53:07,446
What'd we think we were gonna find
behind these solidly built walls?

1242
01:53:07,539 --> 01:53:09,496
A little guessing game, huh, Rod?

1243
01:53:10,083 --> 01:53:13,702
- [man] What do you think? Break it down?
- [Legrand] Sure.

1244
01:53:14,170 --> 01:53:16,287
[chuckles]
I got just the tool.

1245
01:53:30,395 --> 01:53:32,432
Well, we found
what we were looking for.

1246
01:53:48,663 --> 01:53:51,997
[gasps]
Oh, God! The smell!

1247
01:53:53,001 --> 01:53:54,162
Keep going.

1248
01:53:58,214 --> 01:54:01,753
[Usher] <i>It was pregnant.
It had its kittens in there.</i>

1249
01:54:05,430 --> 01:54:06,762
Tear the whole thing down!

1250
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:13,644
- [screeches]
- You walled 'em in there!

1251
01:54:16,900 --> 01:54:17,936
[growling]

1252
01:54:20,195 --> 01:54:23,814
- [growling continues]
- They're... eating... her.

1253
01:54:23,907 --> 01:54:24,907
[gagging]

1254
01:54:25,241 --> 01:54:26,982

[doorbell rings]

1259
01:55:11,204 --> 01:55:13,696
- [knocks]
- [Mr. Pym] What's going on here?

1260
01:55:13,790 --> 01:55:16,578
- [doorbell ringing]
- [man] What's going on in there?

1261
01:55:16,668 --> 01:55:20,628
Open the door!
What's going on in there?

1262
01:55:21,047 --> 01:55:23,630
- [woman] Let us in!
- [man] Open the door!

1263
01:55:23,716 --> 01:55:25,503
