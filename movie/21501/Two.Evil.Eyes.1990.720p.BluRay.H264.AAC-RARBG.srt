5
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,350
To Edgar Allan Poe,

6
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:01,686
whose stories have inspired
this motion picture.

7
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,357
Is that an accusation, Mr. Pike?

8
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,822
Is that some sort of
an accusation, Mr. Pike?

9
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,159
What'd you say?
Nothing. Nothing.

10
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,537
I thought you said something.
No.

11
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,082
I was just talking to myself.
It's nothing.

12
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,702
He's liquidating a substantial
number of his assets here.

13
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:47,834
This represents 15,
possibly 20% of his holdings.

14
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:51,921
I wouldn't know.
Ernie has never talked to me
much about business.

15
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:55,800
Perhaps if he'd be
willing to wait until-
He can't wait, Mr. Pike.

16
00:02:55,884 --> 00:03:00,179
The doctors give him three weeks.
Six at the most.

17
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:02,515
Ernie wants this done now.

18
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,017
With all the proceeds
going to you.

19
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,020
That's right.
Bad timing.

20
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:12,191
The market price
on some of these stocks
is lower than it's been in years.

21
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:16,237
Why doesn't he simply put
these assets in your name?

22
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,991
I don't need assets, Mr. Pike.
I need dollars to live on.

23
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:23,703
You've been remembered,
quite generously, in the will.

24
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:27,206
And how long will it take
to settle the estate, Mr. Pike?

25
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,376
Eighteen months.
Two years.

26
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,587
Depending on-
What do I do
while I'm waiting?

27
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,589
Take a job as a waitress?

28
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,883
I'm not society, Mr. Pike.

29
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,926
I have nothing of my own.

30
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,972
I was a flight attendant
that Ernie brought home
off the red-eye...

31
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:47,476
to the shock and dismay of you
and everyone else in this town.

32
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,563
I married a rich, old man.

33
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:55,067
I let him use me-
for pleasure and for show.

34
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,238
Now I'm going to let him
pay me for my services.

35
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,133
This is Ernest's signature?

36
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,969
Is that some sort of
an accusation, Mr. Pike?

37
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,692
Hello, Ernie. Yes.

38
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,196
Yes. I'm here with Steven Pike.

39
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,033
I gave him the papers.
I don't think he likes it very much.

40
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,870
Well,

41
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,956
are you sure you're up to it?

42
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,042
All right. I'll put him on.

43
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:05,930
Hello, Ernest.
Hello, Steven.

44
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,100
How are you feeling?
How's the pain?

45
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,143
Are you feeling much pain?

46
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:14,230
No. No pain.

47
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,232
Listen, Ernest.

48
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,403
I have these papers here-
the ones you sent.

49
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,405
Yes?

50
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,074
Are you sure you want to do this?

51
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,076
Have you thought this through?

52
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,871
Yes. I want to do it, Steven.

53
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,332
I owe it to Jessica.

54
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,418
Hello?
Yes?

55
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,796
Who is this?
I'm Steven Pike,
Mr. Valdemar's attorney.

56
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,382
Bob Hoffman, Mr. Pike.
I'm Ernie's doctor.

57
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,969
Look. Is all this really necessary?
Uh, Ernie's...

58
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,556
Well, he needs as much rest
as he can get. So, unless
this is something really urgent...

59
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,644
Well, Ernest is asking me
to do something a bit,
uh, unorthodox.

60
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:58,024
Something that's, uh,
very unlike him to do.

61
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:02,862
People with Ernest's prognosis
will often do surprising things,
Mr. Pike.

62
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,448
I can assure you his mind
is as sharp as ever.

63
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,034
I see. I see.
Thank you, Doctor. I...

64
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,163
I hope I haven't disturbed him too much.
I just don't want him agitated.
That's all.

65
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,708
- I'm sure you understand.
- Yes. Yes, of course. Yes, uh...

66
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,044
- Good-bye, Doctor.
- Good-bye.

67
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:28,971
I'll prepare the necessary forms
and mail them to you
for Ernest's signature.

68
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:32,141
Well, I wouldn't want any delays.
I'll stop by and pick them up.

69
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,810
Tomorrow morning.
They'll be ready, I hope?

70
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,190
- They'll be ready.
- Thank you.

71
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,901
Have a nice day, Mr. Pike.

72
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:05,025
God, he's still-
Still under.

73
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,653
Still completely at my command.

74
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,324
Valdemar.

75
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,410
Repeat these words.

76
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,705
I want to do it.

77
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,790
I owe it to Jessica.

78
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:24,628
I want to do it.
I owe it to Jessica.

79
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,755
Wake him up.

80
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,426
To the pain?
To the realization
that he's dying?

81
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,305
He's better off where he is.

82
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,559
Besides,

83
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,020
I thought if we let him sleep,

84
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,523
we might be able to have some time,
liquidate a few assets of our own.

85
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,443
Robert! What if he-
What? What if he hears me?

86
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,153
Well, I'm sure he can. Valdemar.

87
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,364
Do you hear me?
Yes.

88
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,451
I hear you.
Fascinating.

89
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,163
Somewhere deep in his consciousness
he knows exactly what we're doing to him.

90
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,291
But when I wake him,
it'll all disappear.

91
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,794
Like the fragments of a dream.

92
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,880
I don't find it fascinating.

93
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,883
It's morbid.

94
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,885
Frightening.

95
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:19,642
I'm not as...
vindictive as you are.

96
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,311
I don't take any pleasure
out of this.

97
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:27,024
He's a ruthless old man
who treats people
as if they were possessions.

98
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,152
He spent his life taking
whatever he wanted without a care
for anyone else.

99
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:34,615
He took you away from me.
Vindictive? Yes.
Yes, I am vindictive.

100
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,742
He didn't take me. I went.

101
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,995
He didn't know I was seeing you.
He doesn't even realize
we knew each other bef...

102
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:44,083
I want you back, Jess.
Robert. Please. I can't.

103
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,085
Not now. I couldn't.

104
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,214
I-I'm having a very
difficult time with this. I...

105
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:55,511
I need you to try to be sensitive
to that, try to understand
how hard this is for me.

106
00:09:56,554 --> 00:10:01,141
- If you want me to go through with it-
- You already have gone through with this.
There's no turning back anymore.

107
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,103
What are you gonna tell Mr. Pike?
"Oh, this has all been a misunderstanding.

108
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:08,440
I didn't realize my husband was
under hypnosis when I asked him
to sign the papers."

109
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,901
You won't like it in prison, Jessica.
The food's awful.

110
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:18,284
And let's call a spade a spade, all right?
This was your idea, not mine.
I was willing to wait.

111
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,453
I just wanted us to be together again,
but that wasn't good enough, was it?

112
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,872
Not after you got a taste
of what it was to be rich.

113
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:27,668
- You're going to pretend
you don't care about the money?
- No. Of course I want the money,

114
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,795
but I want you too,
and I thought you wanted me.

115
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,880
I do.

116
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,759
Robert, I do. Uh...

117
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,761
It’s just difficult...

118
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,806
Difficult to care about someone
you know is a thief?

119
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,144
I know.

120
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,229
I have the same problem.

121
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,950
Valdemar.
I'm going to wake you now.

122
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,120
When I count to five,

123
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:06,415
you will be completely awake
and alert.

124
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,501
One...

125
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,879
You will not remember anything.

126
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:16,383
Two. You're starting
to regain your senses.

127
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,846
Three. Starting to see the room.

128
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,182
Starting to see me.

129
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,225
Four.

130
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,438
Oh, God! The pain!

131
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,567
God. Can't you help him?

132
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:37,571
He'll be asleep soon.
He's had his injection.
There's not much else I can do.

133
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,866
You could stay with him.
That's what you're being paid for.

134
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,452
You should have him
in a hospital.

135
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,746
A man in his advanced state.

136
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,957
Keeping him at home.
I have never seen anything like it.

137
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,627
In all my years of nursing,
I've never seen anything like it.

138
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:05,682
Where is that bitch
of a wife of mine?

139
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,685
Where is she?

140
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,022
Out spending my money.

141
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,901
Where is she? Where...

142
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,071
Jessica!

143
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,156
Jessica!

144
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,162
Jessica!

145
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,588
Jessica!

146
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:46,890
Two of the money market accounts
are with the local bank.

147
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:51,353
Those funds are available to you now.
See Mr. Pratt.

148
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:54,064
The rest is going to take some time.

149
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,942
How much time?
Paperwork, mails,

150
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,403
out-of-town checks
will have to clear.

151
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,488
Two to three weeks.

152
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:08,120
If anything should
happen to Ernest,

153
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,664
you'll have a hard time collecting,
I'm afraid.

154
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,333
So do your best to keep him
alive, won't you?

155
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,753
- I'll do my best.
- I'm sure you will.

156
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:29,808
This is quite a lot to be walking
around with in cash, Mrs. Valdemar.

157
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:33,353
Now, we do offer a liquid asset
account that would allow you to
withdraw any amount...

158
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,939
I'll be wanting to talk to you about that.

159
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:39,318
I'll be coming into quite a large sum
in the next few weeks.

160
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,445
Something over three million,
I'm told.

161
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,700
And, of course,
I'll be wanting to put it someplace
where it will be safe.

162
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:50,496
But this-
I have a need for this in cash.

163
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,917
Whatever you say, Mrs. Valdemar.
Whenever you're ready,
just give me a call.

164
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,794
We're, uh-
We're here to please.

165
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,568
That's good enough, Martha.
You can go.

166
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,571
We've not done
the upstairs yet, Mrs. V.
It doesn't need to be done.

167
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:27,199
It's fine. Really.
You can get it next time.

168
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,201
If you say so, mum.

169
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,704
All right, people.
Let's pack it up.
We're leaving.

170
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:36,250
Mr. V seems in a bad way today, mum.

171
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,461
Yes. He's, uh, been bad
for some time now.

172
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:43,465
Poor old soul.
Night nurse left,
and I didn't know what to do.

173
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,592
I'm sorry. I didn't expect
to be gone so long.

174
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,053
That's all right.
Doctor's with him now.

175
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,305
Oh, he's here? Good.

176
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,355
Sign your name, Valdemar.
Sign your name on the line.

177
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,869
Again, Valdemar.

178
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,957
Here. On the line.

179
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,043
Sign your name again.

180
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,686
Done.

181
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,731
- Is he-
- Still under.

182
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,151
Come here.

183
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,072
Are you sure you want to?

184
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,077
Yes.

185
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,708
What did you put in the safe, Jesse?

186
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,794
The safe?

187
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,047
When you came in.

188
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,092
I saw you put something
in the safe. What was it?

189
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,636
Money.

190
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,430
You got the money.
Some.

191
00:16:56,808 --> 00:17:00,644
Just a little.
How much is a little?

192
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:04,106
I don't know.
A few thousand.

193
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,735
None of it mine, I suppose.

194
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,029
I'll have the rest in a few weeks.

195
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:14,491
Oh. Nothing for me
until the job is finished. Is that it?

196
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,745
That's not fair.

197
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,998
I haven't gotten anything
out of this, Jess.

198
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,209
Soon.

199
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,753
In a few weeks.

200
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:29,881
In a few weeks we'll have it all.

201
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,592
Just think of it. A million dollars.

202
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,930
A million dollars for us to share.

203
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,312
Mine in cash. Remember?

204
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,566
No checks.

205
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,529
Nothing with my name on it.
Ah, don't worry.

206
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,991
Nothing to connect us.
There's nothing to connect us.

207
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,828
Nothing at all to connect us.

208
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,755
It's Ernest.

209
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,742
Oh, my God.

210
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:12,234
Keep him alive
for a few more weeks.
That's what Pike said you had to do.

211
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:17,405
That's what we're going to do.
No one needs to know
he died here tonight.

212
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:23,829
We wait till the money comes through.
Then he dies a few days later.

213
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,213
Won't he have to be examined?

214
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,843
By a doctor. That's me.
I'll sign the death certificate.

215
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:42,222
- What about the funeral?
- Closed coffin.

216
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,892
- Cremation.
- We can’t just do that ourselves.

217
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:48,812
No. State law.
It has to be someone licensed.

218
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,523
We don't have to
have him embalmed,

219
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,942
but the body does
have to be handled.

220
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,528
In three weeks he'll be...

221
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,613
Yes. He'll be melted.

222
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,368
Unless...

223
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,122
In your basement.

224
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,959
You can't be serious.

225
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,045
How badly do you want this, Jess?

226
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,706
Oh, God.

227
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:56,296
Jess, give me a hand.
You gotta give me a hand here, Jess.

228
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,798
Try to free the arm.

229
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,343
Get the arm off the banister there.

230
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,182
Jesse, for God's sake,
I'm losing him!

231
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,159
It's the nurse.

232
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,871
- Answer it.
- No.

233
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:34,292
- If you don't answer it, she'll be
bugging us all night. Get rid of her.

234
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:49,140
Uh, I-I should have called you.
I'm sorry. Uh, I won't be needing you.

235
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,310
I came all this way.

236
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:54,896
I'm gonna have to
charge you for my time.

237
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,942
Will you be
wanting me tomorrow?

238
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,528
No. Uh...

239
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:04,614
Actually, I have decided
to take your advice.

240
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:08,118
I- I'm-I'm putting Mr. Valdemar
into a hospital.

241
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,996
I won't be needing you anymore.
Well, it is about time.

242
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,373
A man in his advanced state.

243
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,792
I'm here. I would be happy
to look in on him.

244
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,712
Uh, no. Uh, the doctor's
with him right now.

245
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:21,589
Well, I'm sorry to lose the work,

246
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:26,011
but I am glad to see
that you are finally
doing the right thing.

247
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:29,681
I'll see that they send you
an adjusted bill. Good night.
Good night.

248
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,766
Thank you-for all your help.

249
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,253
What if we need
more signatures?

250
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,967
I've done enough.
You can do the forging.

251
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:12,182
You better practice,
just in case.

252
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:17,270
What if Pike calls,
wants to talk to him?

253
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,731
No phone calls.
Doctor's orders.

254
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:23,526
What if he comes to the house?
He won't.

255
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,613
He gives you a hard time,
but underneath it all,
he doesn't give a shit.

256
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:29,574
As long as he gets his fees,
that's all he cares about.

257
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,368
That's all anybody
ever cares about in the end.

258
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,790
Money.
Yeah.

259
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,958
Has a way, doesn't it?

260
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:51,930
All taken care of.
400,000 in a liquid asset account.

261
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,682
There's your checkbook. And...

262
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:59,145
another 100,000 for you here.

263
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,065
Do you mind if I ask what use...

264
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,109
you could possibly have
for all this cash?

265
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,528
I do mind, Mr. Pratt.
It's private business.

266
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,833
You scared the hell out of me.

267
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:47,587
What are you doing down here?
I-I thought I heard something.

268
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:50,632
It sounded...

269
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:53,885
It sounded like Ernest.

270
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,180
Come on.
Come away from there.

271
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,356
Stay with me tonight.

272
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:09,609
Jess, you gotta get a hold of yourself.
Robert, please.

273
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:14,197
I can't be alone here anymore. I-
I can't stand being alone here.

274
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,741
All right. I'll stay.

275
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,841
You're not gonna
freak out on me, are you?

276
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,843
You're gonna be able
to get through this.

277
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,513
Because if you’re not, tell me now,

278
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,890
so I can pull out
and start covering my tracks.

279
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:45,603
He said,
in his typically kind
and understanding way.

280
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:49,148
I am sorry, Robert,
if I am not strong enough for you.

281
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:52,735
I didn't go to medical school.
I haven't spent a lot of time
around cadavers.

282
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:25,977
What are you doing?

283
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,438
I'm going to sleep.
You should do the same.

284
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,732
I can give you something,
if you like.

285
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:34,777
God, no.
After all that gin, you'd drop.

286
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:38,239
I should teach you how to do this-
self-hypnosis.
It's better than any pill.

287
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:44,746
You know, you won't be able to wake me.
So, if you think you might change your mind
and want to mess around...

288
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,373
I won't be able to wake you?
When you're hypnotized,

289
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:50,501
you can only be wakened
by the voice that put you under.

290
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,545
When you hypnotize yourself,
there's no such voice.

291
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,798
I need to have you with me.
I am with you.

292
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:57,842
If I can't wake you...

293
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,886
I have got to get some sleep.

294
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,681
I have an early appointment.
I've been neglecting my practice.

295
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,850
You're not the only one
that's strung out, Jess.

296
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,270
The last few weeks haven't exactly
been a vacation for me either.

297
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:13,649
I'm here. I'm with you.
Nothing is gonna happen.

298
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:18,029
I'm just gonna sleep for a few hours.

299
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,474
Robert.

300
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:52,397
Robert.

301
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:56,150
Bastard.

302
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,387
Robert.

303
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:27,473
Goddamn you.

304
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:57,271
Robert. Robert.

305
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:00,233
Wake up!
Robert, wake up! Robert!

306
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:30,179
He's still alive.

307
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:37,853
Here. Here.
Take a look at him.
See for yourself.

308
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:41,607
Come down here, Jessica,
and look at him.

309
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:45,987
-Just take one look at him,
then tell me you think he's still alive.
- I can't.

310
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,627
Uh, Valdemar?

311
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,882
Are you there?

312
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:09,677
Yes.

313
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:22,273
Valdemar, uh, are you still, uh...

314
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,358
Sleeping.

315
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,154
Sleeping?

316
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,239
Yes.

317
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:32,241
No.

318
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:35,620
I have been sleeping,

319
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,123
and now...

320
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:42,209
I am dead.

321
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,879
Oh, Mother of God.

322
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,886
Valdemar.

323
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,227
Valdemar.

324
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,399
Valdemar, can you hear me?

325
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:21,165
Nothing.
Over an hour, and nothing more.

326
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:25,753
It's a trick. I-It's a recorded voice.

327
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:28,381
Someone's doing this to us. Pike.
Oh, please.

328
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:31,509
It's either that,
or he's still alive.
He's dead, Jessica.

329
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:34,720
There's no vital signs.
He's frozen solid,
for Christ's sake.

330
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:39,642
I don't know.
I mean, I don't know
what's going on here.

331
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:43,729
All I can think is that he was
hypnotized when he died, so...

332
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:47,274
somehow we're still able
to communicate with him.

333
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:51,320
It seems impossible, but...

334
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:54,323
there's no other explanation
that makes any sense.

335
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,331
Here. Here.

336
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,792
Take two of these now,
and take another at 11:00.

337
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,877
And lay off the liquor.

338
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,673
You're not leaving.
I have to.

339
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,675
Robert, you can't.

340
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,885
I have an endoscopy at 8:00.

341
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,888
They're prepping the patient right now.
I've canceled this guy three times.

342
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,974
You can't do this to me.

343
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,561
We are felons, Jessica.

344
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,563
We have committed
grand larceny here...

345
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:28,566
and fraud and God knows what else.

346
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,402
The last thing we need to do
is to arouse suspicion.

347
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,697
We have to maintain an air of, uh...

348
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,782
An air of normality?

349
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,787
Look.

350
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:44,623
Uh, I'll leave early.
I'll be back here by 2:30.

351
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:48,127
You don't have to stay in the house.
Go outside. Get some air.

352
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,838
Take the pills,
and calm yourself.

353
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,133
Take the pills, Jessica.

354
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,226
No booze, Jessica.

355
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,523
Here.

356
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:14,904
Let me see you take 'em.

357
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:26,999
I'm terrified.

358
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,921
I know. I know.

359
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,590
I'm sorry.

360
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,675
I shouldn't be so, uh...

361
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,434
We'll be all right. Just...

362
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,686
try to think logically.

363
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:50,564
There's a logical explanation
for everything.

364
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,612
There's a logical explanation
for everything.

365
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:14,046
Oh, yeah? There is
no such thing as monsters.

366
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,774
Are you comfortable?

367
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,777
Yes.

368
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:41,198
Do you have any more pain?

369
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:43,242
No.

370
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,327
No pain.

371
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:53,377
Are you comfortable?

372
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,462
Yes.

373
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:00,009
Do you have any more pain?

374
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:03,971
No. No pain.

375
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,266
Where are you, Valdemar?

376
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,145
Can you see anything? Can you...

377
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:16,358
tell me what you see?
Lights.

378
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:19,486
Very bright.

379
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,488
Very far...

380
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,658
in the distance.

381
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,745
Can't reach them.

382
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:31,498
Where I am, it is dark.

383
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,836
Dark. Cold.

384
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,549
Very cold.

385
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:45,262
Help me, Jessica!

386
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:47,264
God.

387
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:49,391
- Jesse?
- No.

388
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:53,228
- No.
- Christ. Don't go
spooking around like that.

389
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:56,023
Others.

390
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,613
There are others.

391
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,952
Others?
Many,

392
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,621
many others.

393
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,832
Looking at me.

394
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:16,043
Watching me.

395
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,506
They want something.

396
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,467
These, uh, others...

397
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,552
can you see them?

398
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:29,974
What do they look like?
Who are they?

399
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,769
Valdemar.

400
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,481
Valdemar.

401
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:05,092
Where I am, it is dark.

402
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,638
Dark. Cold.

403
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,559
Very cold.

404
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:19,565
There is consciousness after death.

405
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,325
Others.

406
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,913
He said there were...

407
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,999
others.

408
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,721
Took advantage of
end-of-model-year incentives.

409
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,849
If that sector is stripped away,
retail sales for August...

410
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,393
were up a much slimmer
two-tenths percent.

411
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:59,772
Still, for the year thus far,
sales are up 5.9%...

412
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:02,983
from the first
eight months of 1988.

413
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:04,943
James Limbaugh, Washington.

414
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:08,739
The market continued to be the victim
of sell programs and profit taking today,

415
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,992
as the first of many economic reports,
this one on retail sales, was...

416
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:18,707
Help me!

417
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:26,507
Valdemar, I'm here.

418
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,592
I'm with you.

419
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,844
Help me.

420
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,099
What-What can I do?

421
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:38,435
Wake me.

422
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,897
Wake you?
I am dead.

423
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,359
Let me go.

424
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:50,197
Wake me and let me go.

425
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,051
Wake you? Of course.

426
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:15,973
You're still-You're still hypnotized.
If I wake you...

427
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:19,143
I will be released.

428
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:23,105
Quickly. The others.

429
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,774
The others are coming.

430
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:30,195
I am part of both worlds.

431
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,866
Theirs and yours.

432
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,785
They want to use me...

433
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,829
to pass through.

434
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:43,125
To pass through.
They're coming.

435
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:46,795
Wake me. Wake me before...

436
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,928
It's over.

437
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,600
It's finished.

438
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:09,026
How could you do this?

439
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,236
How in the hell could you do this?

440
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:15,032
What are we supposed
to do now, Jessica?

441
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:20,037
How do we explain two bullet holes
in his body when he is supposed
to have died of natural causes?

442
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:22,539
We don't have to explain anything.
We're gonna bury him.

443
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:27,044
Bury him.
In the woods, out back.

444
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,546
Oh-
We'll say we...

445
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:31,548
took him somewhere else
for the funeral.

446
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,592
His hometown. Harrisburg.
Oh, Christ.

447
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:37,012
We have money, Robert.
It’s just like you said.

448
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,139
People won't ask
too many questions.

449
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:42,559
They'll cooperate,
as long as there's enough money.

450
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:44,895
I'm a living example of that.
God, I never should have...

451
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:48,607
We have to bury him, Robert.
It's the only way
to be rid of this.

452
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:55,489
He asked me to...

453
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,992
let him go, to wake him.

454
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:03,330
He was not dead.
He couldn't have been dead.

455
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,415
It's not possible.

456
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:09,628
Somehow the hypnosis kept him alive.

457
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,672
What if he's still...

458
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:16,593
How can we bury him if
there's still a chance that he might-
We have no choice, Robert.

459
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:19,388
We have no choice.

460
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,185
You have no choice.

461
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,729
If they find out about me,
they'll find out about you.

462
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:32,359
I'll deny it. Ah-
Ah, I'll deny everything.

463
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:35,070
Deny you talked to Pike?

464
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:42,596
Robert?

465
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,954
Robert?

466
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:17,839
Robert, is that you?

467
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:23,470
They're coming for you, Jessica.

468
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:26,973
They're coming for you.

469
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,603
They don't want me...

470
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:36,149
to go into the ground.

471
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:37,192
Oh!

472
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,347
It isn't me, Jessica.

473
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:10,767
It's the others.

474
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:21,111
It's the others, Jessica.

475
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,197
Using my body.

476
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:31,163
I asked you to help me.

477
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:35,876
You should have helped me.

478
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,961
Now...

479
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,338
it's too late!

480
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:58,583
Valdemar.

481
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:01,169
I'm gonna wake you, Valdemar!

482
00:48:01,254 --> 00:48:03,505
I'm gonna count to five.

483
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:06,424
One! Two!

484
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:10,387
Three! Four!

485
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:12,430
Five!

486
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,397
It's too late.

487
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:26,319
The others...

488
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:28,405
The others.

489
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:33,410
Without me, they can't return.

490
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:43,587
They're with you now.

491
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:47,507
They're with you.

492
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:43,271
Come on. Let's go. Nice night.

493
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:48,568
- Watch that umbrella.
- Come on. We got one over here.

494
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:52,322
Let 'em through here.
Let 'em through.

495
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,205
That's good right there.

496
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:05,043
Come on.

497
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,887
Guess she was gonna
bury him back here.

498
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,473
She couldn't have dug
that grave by herself.

499
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:24,145
We figure she popped him,
then shot herself.

500
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,564
Very strange things though.

501
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:30,235
We found blood in the freezer
down in the cellar.
Christ.

502
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,446
Rich people.

503
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:36,324
The sick stuff always turns out
to be rich people.

504
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,787
She had him in the freezer, huh?
That's what we think.

505
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:47,043
And there was blood
in the freezer.

506
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:50,380
So she had him down there
after he was shot.
Looks that way.

507
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,382
So how'd he get up here?

508
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,676
That's what we're asking ourselves.

509
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,637
Wait. Wait till you get
a load of this.

510
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,644
Oh, my God.

511
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,897
This guy's been dead for weeks.

512
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,450
911.
Yeah.

513
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:47,038
It's god-awful.
Screaming, crying,
like somebody's in some real pain.

514
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:51,334
How long's this
been going on?
A week. Two weeks maybe.

515
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:54,587
Long enough to have
the rest of us in the building
crazy over it.

516
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:57,924
Couldn't get anyone
to do anything about it.
You know how people are.

517
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,218
Shit. It's driving me to drink.

518
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:03,763
- I'm the guy who called 911.
- Well, you did the right thing.

519
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,770
Police, Hoffman! Open up!

520
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,528
Hit it.

521
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:28,830
Hoffman?

522
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:10,663
What'd I tell you?
Another rich guy.

523
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:13,416
Call in the troops.

524
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,903
Help.

525
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:45,239
There's no one to wake me.

526
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:48,284
No one to wake me.

527
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:50,662
What?

528
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:53,873
Oh! Oh!

529
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:58,002
No!

530
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,798
Oh!

531
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:14,852
It's the depravity that's in all of us.

532
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:22,986
Perversity is one of
the prime impulses of the heart.

533
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:27,615
- Who's never done something wrong just because it was forbidden?
- Watch your step there.

534
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,201
To be evil only for the love
of being evil.

535
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,999
Sir, do you think there's any
chance of me being transferred...

536
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:37,750
back to parking violations?

537
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:41,045
No. I-I don't
want any dinner, O'Neill.

538
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:43,131
Maybe just some coffee.

539
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:46,259
No, sir. I was asking
about a transfer.

540
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:50,888
- Out. Oh, I'm real impressed. Out.
- This is a pass to come in here.
Can you read English?

541
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:54,308
I can read English.
I can read any language you want.
You don't come in with one of those.

542
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:59,439
I want the police! I want to see the police! What's the matter, Rod?
You having a little problem with the bouncer? He's all right.

543
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:01,482
There's the police.
Be my guest.

544
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:10,199
How is it you get sent down
on every one of these, huh?

545
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:12,285
Still life is my specialty.

546
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,997
Already get him?

547
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:19,208
Yeah, this morning.
Bastard was asleep,
right next to her.

548
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,797
So who was the first one
on the scene?
Valenz.

549
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:47,528
Man! Oh!

550
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:49,989
Hey, Usher.
Who the hell told you
to pull that lever?

551
00:56:52,493 --> 00:56:54,660
You trying to get somebody killed?
Somebody stop this thing.

552
00:56:54,787 --> 00:56:57,288
I'm sorry.
You're sorry.

553
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:03,836
Look at him
taking pictures, will ya?

554
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:09,592
What's the big hurry, Usher?
Stiff's not going anywhere.

555
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:44,210
Where did you come from?

556
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,173
How did you get in here?

557
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:54,220
Oh. You have to get off the paper.
Come on.

558
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,475
How did you get in here?
How did you...

559
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:06,732
What did you do to her?
What did I do to her?
Look what she did to me.

560
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:09,277
Whose cat is it?

561
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:12,363
Did you scratch him?

562
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:15,283
You mustn't do that.
He's very fragile.

563
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:18,119
Where did she come from?
She's ours.

564
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:20,163
I found her outside.

565
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:24,584
You were so hungry, weren't you?
But I'll take care of you.

566
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:27,003
Isn't she pretty?

567
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:29,589
She has a beautiful
white spot on her chest.

568
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:34,093
We can keep her, can't we?

569
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,889
Sure, honey.

570
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:39,974
Good.

571
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:41,577
- What is it?
- The cat. I think it's staring at me.

572
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:43,579
My brave lover.

573
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:48,042
Yeah, well, what if it decides
to jump up here
in the middle of the night and...

574
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,670
claw my eyes out?

575
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,693
Better? Hmm?

576
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:32,044
I can be brave when I have to.

577
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:38,342
I see a lot of terrible things
in my work. You don't know.

578
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:40,428
You're superstitious.

579
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,390
I think it's 'cause
she's a black cat.

580
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:50,646
You know where those
superstitions began, don't you?
It was in the Middle Ages.

581
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:56,110
Inquisitors burned women
and black cats 'cause
they thought they were witches.

582
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:58,821
Finally, there weren't
many black cats left.

583
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:03,075
Cats remember, so they don't trust.

584
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:19,902
Three, four.

585
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:14,350
What happened?
I heard her screaming.

586
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:17,019
I accidentally caught her tail
in the door.

587
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:20,189
She's all right.
By the way, what's her name?

588
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,525
It's a secret.

589
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,368
Don't hurt her.

590
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,129
News International, Joe Wilson.

591
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:47,049
That fire on Oak Street?
Yeah, we've had a man
down there since 9:00.

592
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:50,928
- Are you saying you don't like it?
- No, I'm not saying that at all.

593
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:54,515
No, I-The crime photos are terrific.
They're startling.

594
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:58,352
I- I'm just saying contrast.
Contrast, that's all I'm saying.

595
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,354
But there's contrast here.

596
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:03,524
Rod, look. You know what
I'm talking about here.

597
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:07,736
Now, shots with the same tone,
but something other than crime photos.

598
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:10,698
Show the skeptics
you really have an eye.

599
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:13,367
No, he hasn't checked in yet.

600
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,661
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

601
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,913
Usher, you got a job downtown!

602
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:19,999
Thanks, Reverend.
Bye, Reverend.

603
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:23,002
See you next week.

604
01:06:57,389 --> 01:06:59,390
That's a good pussycat.

605
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:04,436
Good pussycat.

606
01:07:13,405 --> 01:07:15,781
Yes, you're a...

607
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,882
How 'bout fixing me
something to eat?

608
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:17,176
I'm here. The cat's not.

609
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:23,474
Hello?

610
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:26,727
Hi, Anne.

611
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:30,105
No, I haven't heard anything at all.
I'm frantic about it.

612
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:32,775
No, not really.

613
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:36,695
I will. Thank you.

614
01:08:37,906 --> 01:08:39,948
Don't you think
this is a bit much?

615
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:43,952
I mean,
your friends are calling you...

616
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:47,915
like it's some sort of
a fucking personal crisis.

617
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:53,045
Christ. You'd think
your child had been kidnapped.

618
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,047
I don't have a child.

619
01:08:57,717 --> 01:09:00,385
Why don't you go and drink
somewhere else?

620
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:04,431
Hey, this is my fucking kitchen.

621
01:09:04,516 --> 01:09:06,475
And I'll fucking stay.

622
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:10,562
And I'll fucking drink
if I fucking want!

623
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:17,110
I didn't fucking do anything!

624
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,115
Hello?

625
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,827
Hello, Christian.

626
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:27,329
No, I'm fine.
Did you practice?

627
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:30,999
Good. No, not yet.

628
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:34,962
Listen, I can't really talk right now.
Okay? I'll talk to you later.

629
01:09:40,385 --> 01:09:42,302
I know you killed her.

630
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:48,642
What, uh, are you talking about?
You are crazy. Do you know that?

631
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:52,855
It's a fucking cat.

632
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:55,065
A cat!

633
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:58,652
- You killed her.
- And I didn't kill her!

634
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:00,696
Yes, you did. You killed her.
I didn't!

635
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:03,282
Yes, you did.

636
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:07,953
Don't you ever, ever hit me!

637
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,469
No!

638
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:16,396
Rod.

639
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:20,525
Come on. Come on.

640
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:29,201
Oh, Rod.

641
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:34,373
Rod.

642
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:39,544
Come on, Rod.

643
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,218
Rod.

644
01:11:49,097 --> 01:11:51,098
Come on.

645
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:45,921
Say it, my sweet.

646
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:48,673
Who is thy murderer?

647
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:05,649
Rod?

648
01:14:13,616 --> 01:14:15,784
Rod?

649
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:28,797
Kill him!

650
01:14:31,843 --> 01:14:35,512
Your punishment is written here
in this white spot.

651
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:39,057
That is your destiny.
Where is it written?

652
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:42,394
There's nothing written.

653
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,980
Do you see it?

654
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:48,733
Do you see the mark?

655
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:57,742
Death! Give him death!

656
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:18,096
Get him!

657
01:16:32,213 --> 01:16:34,881
Okay, take it easy.

658
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:40,595
Okay, get your hands off that.
On his feet.

659
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:43,682
Come on. On your feet, asshole.

660
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:47,185
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Flunk out of dental school or what?

661
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:49,479
It was his cousin.

662
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:51,481
You know why he did it?

663
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:54,276
To pull her teeth out.

664
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,361
All 32 of 'em.

665
01:16:57,530 --> 01:17:01,825
How can a man
do something like that?

666
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:03,910
I'll never figure it out.

667
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:10,917
Come on. Get in.

668
01:17:11,002 --> 01:17:13,211
Come on. Get in, all right?

669
01:17:13,296 --> 01:17:15,297
But I didn't finish!

670
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:20,010
Say, Rod.

671
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:23,096
You might wanna get a shot of this.

672
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:29,936
What is it, Usher?
You all right?

673
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:32,939
Yeah.
Hey, I'm sorry.

674
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:36,318
No, no. I just have
a little bit of a hangover.
Oh.

675
01:17:36,444 --> 01:17:38,361
Open the box.
You sure?

676
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:41,323
Yeah.

677
01:18:09,769 --> 01:18:11,770
Annabel, what's wrong?

678
01:18:12,897 --> 01:18:16,441
Look, is it your cat?
I know she's gonna
come home soon.

679
01:18:21,489 --> 01:18:23,490
God, you're beautiful.

680
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:35,043
Kiss me.

681
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:36,563
Joseph, I don't even-
I don't even know how to say this.

682
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:39,065
It's like I'm living in a nightmare...

683
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:41,192
and he's a stranger.

684
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:45,280
The pictures in this book,
I can't believe it.

685
01:19:45,364 --> 01:19:47,490
Listen, can you find me a place
in New York?

686
01:19:47,575 --> 01:19:50,535
Yes, I can go anytime.

687
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,787
I just have to get out of here.

688
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:55,707
Can you help me?

689
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:02,046
Will you call me?

690
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:06,843
Oh, God, I'm frightened.

691
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:12,390
I'm frightened.

692
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:51,721
What-What is there south of heaven?
What's-What's south of heaven?

693
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:55,433
Ever read Dante's Divine Comedy?

694
01:20:57,603 --> 01:21:00,688
The canticles
of the Last Judgment?

695
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:03,691
No.
The texts...

696
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:07,028
of the reincarnation of chic.

697
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:09,864
Are you not gonna tell me
'cause I haven't?

698
01:21:09,949 --> 01:21:12,867
No.

699
01:21:12,952 --> 01:21:15,537
But you can try and guess.

700
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:38,351
What's the matter?
You don't like cats, pal?

701
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:41,521
Is it yours?
No.

702
01:21:41,605 --> 01:21:43,731
It just kind of wandered in
a couple days ago.

703
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:46,568
She was hungry. I fed her.
I'm a sucker for animals.

704
01:21:48,279 --> 01:21:50,655
Want another shot?

705
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:58,496
My girlfriend had a cat
that looked just like that one.

706
01:21:58,581 --> 01:22:01,708
Maybe it's hers.

707
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:04,586
Like I said,
she just wandered in.
No.

708
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:06,796
Hers is dead.

709
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:11,134
Strange how she's looking at you.

710
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:13,845
Why don't you pet her?

711
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:18,349
Hell, she's probably
your girlfriend's cat.

712
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:23,229
See this white spot?
Does your girlfriend's cat
have a spot like that?

713
01:22:23,314 --> 01:22:25,023
There's a little design in it.

714
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:26,858
What design?

715
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,944
Do you see it?

716
01:22:31,405 --> 01:22:33,406
Do you see the mark?

717
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:39,454
You can hardly see it, but...

718
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,751
if you want to,
we can look at it together.

719
01:22:44,877 --> 01:22:48,921
No.
My name's Eleonora.

720
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:52,175
No. Thanks.

721
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:55,678
Whatever.

722
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:58,097
Hello?

723
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:00,642
Annabel?
Joseph.

724
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:05,688
Good news. I found you a place
to stay and I got some info
on some possible teaching positions.

725
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:10,026
Oh, that's great.
It’s just a small place for
a couple of weeks, but it's a start.

726
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:13,446
I don't care.
I don't care what it is,
as long as I get out of here.

727
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:15,948
Listen, I'm gonna try to get
a flight tonight.

728
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:18,826
Okay, call me with your flight info
and I'll pick you up.

729
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:20,912
I will.

730
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:56,614
Where is the cat?

731
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:03,996
Will you sell her to me?

732
01:24:04,081 --> 01:24:06,165
Why not?
Where is she?

733
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:17,885
I put her in here.

734
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:24,976
I knew you'd come back for her.

735
01:24:25,978 --> 01:24:28,646
She's been waiting for you.

736
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:32,483
For me?
Yes.

737
01:24:34,945 --> 01:24:36,946
It's marvelous.

738
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:42,577
It's your destiny.
She's pregnant.

739
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,651
Oh, sweetheart.
Yes, I'm here.

740
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:23,613
It's okay. Yes, yes.

741
01:27:26,033 --> 01:27:28,743
You're alive! Pussy.

742
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:32,163
No!

743
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:37,501
No!

744
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:48,679
No!

745
01:27:48,764 --> 01:27:50,765
I'm gonna kill her!

746
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:57,521
No. No!

747
01:27:57,606 --> 01:28:00,274
No.

748
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,735
Give her to me.
No! No!

749
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:04,987
Give me the cat.
No!

750
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:08,366
No!
Your cat's dead.

751
01:28:14,164 --> 01:28:15,539
Go!

752
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:22,500
You're waking up
the whole damn neighborhood.

753
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:25,961
Now turn that damn noise down.
I'm sorry.

754
01:30:26,088 --> 01:30:32,009
It's Annabel.
We had an argument, and she locked
herself upstairs in-in her room.

755
01:30:32,094 --> 01:30:35,387
I don't know about any argument.
We just want to sleep.

756
01:30:35,472 --> 01:30:38,390
Of course. I'm sorry.
I'll tell her.

757
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:44,021
- Hey, what was that?
- Annabel, I think.

758
01:30:44,106 --> 01:30:48,400
Didn't you say that your wife
was up in her room?

759
01:30:50,237 --> 01:30:52,530
What's all this?

760
01:30:53,532 --> 01:30:55,574
It looks like blood.

761
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:05,167
Oh, I-I cut my foot coming down-
coming down the stairs.

762
01:31:05,252 --> 01:31:09,171
I didn't-didn't realize it.
Oh. Oh.

763
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:12,133
I better take care of it.
Good night.
Yeah.

764
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:15,094
And, uh, don't forget
about the music. I mean...

765
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:17,513
Yes.
Okay.

766
01:31:22,102 --> 01:31:24,770
"Life here has become ugly.

767
01:31:24,855 --> 01:31:26,856
"I'm leaving you.

768
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:31,277
"I know enough of what has happened
to never want to see you again.

769
01:31:31,361 --> 01:31:33,654
Do not look for me."

770
01:31:47,294 --> 01:31:51,338
You wanted to leave me,
but now we're together forever.

771
01:32:14,154 --> 01:32:16,155
Hi. I'm here for my lesson.

772
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:18,324
Not today. We're leaving.

773
01:32:18,408 --> 01:32:21,994
Leaving? But Annabel told me
I had a lesson...

774
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:25,080
She must have made a mistake.
We're going on a vacation.

775
01:32:25,207 --> 01:32:26,707
Well, can-
954? Mr. Usher?

776
01:32:26,833 --> 01:32:29,501
Come on in.
Well, can I at least say good-bye?

777
01:32:29,586 --> 01:32:32,379
She's sleeping.
Just put it right there.

778
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:35,049
Make sure to be quiet.
Somebody's sleeping.

779
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:38,344
Quiet. Somebody's sleeping.

780
01:33:22,764 --> 01:33:26,350
Sorry about last night.
Annabel and me...

781
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:28,644
Oh, for me?

782
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:31,855
Oh, how sweet.

783
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:35,901
You know how it is.
We had an argument. Pfft.

784
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:38,862
Oh, nothing serious, I hope.
No.

785
01:33:38,947 --> 01:33:42,074
As a matter of fact,
we're going away for a week
to be alone together.

786
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:45,494
Oh, that'll be so nice.
Annabel needs it.

787
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:49,665
She's been kind of gloomy
ever since her cat disappeared.
So we'll see you next week.

788
01:33:49,791 --> 01:33:53,961
Say good-bye to Mr. Pym for me.
Oh, he'll be right back.
You can catch him before we go out.

789
01:33:54,045 --> 01:33:55,838
You're going out?

790
01:33:55,922 --> 01:33:59,133
My hubby's taking me
to the movies tonight.

791
01:33:59,217 --> 01:34:01,218
We love the movies.

792
01:35:09,996 --> 01:35:12,873
Mr. Pym.

793
01:35:13,583 --> 01:35:16,210
- Mrs. Pym. See you next week.
- Oh, look.

794
01:35:16,336 --> 01:35:19,880
Ah!

795
01:35:20,006 --> 01:35:23,550
The bastard!
Come on. He’s just trying
to be friendly.

796
01:35:23,635 --> 01:35:25,969
Imagine taking a vacation
in this weather.

797
01:35:28,807 --> 01:35:32,351
They saw us leaving together.
Two witnesses.

798
01:35:32,435 --> 01:35:34,728
Nobody will think of looking
for you in the house.

799
01:35:57,710 --> 01:36:01,672
Mister. Your drink.

800
01:36:01,756 --> 01:36:03,715
Thanks.

801
01:36:03,842 --> 01:36:06,927
How's your wife feeling?
Much better.

802
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:09,972
Thanks.
In fact, she's leaving today.

803
01:36:10,056 --> 01:36:12,558
Nothing worse than getting sick
on your vacation, huh?

804
01:36:12,684 --> 01:36:14,601
Will you be eating here?
Yes.

805
01:36:14,686 --> 01:36:17,020
After I drop her off at the station.

806
01:36:54,142 --> 01:36:56,810
Hello.

807
01:37:17,415 --> 01:37:19,416
Hello.

808
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:23,921
Hello!

809
01:38:38,371 --> 01:38:42,249
Hey, sorry. It's just me.
It's Christian.
What are you doing here?

810
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:46,378
I-I left my violin.
I've been calling all week,
but nobody answered.

811
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:49,214
And I need to practice, so I-
Well, you got it.
Now get out.

812
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:53,594
All right.
Where's Annabel?
She's left.

813
01:38:53,678 --> 01:38:58,473
She's gone on tour with an orchestra.
She'll be gone for a while-
two, three weeks.

814
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:00,642
You have her address?
No.

815
01:39:03,730 --> 01:39:05,939
She-She's traveling a lot.

816
01:39:08,151 --> 01:39:10,944
- Hello.
- Hi. Can I speak to Annabel?

817
01:39:11,029 --> 01:39:13,155
Hmm?
She gave me this number.

818
01:39:13,239 --> 01:39:16,408
Is she there?
No, she's left.

819
01:39:16,492 --> 01:39:21,455
I don't understand.
Who-Who is this?
Did you call before?

820
01:39:21,539 --> 01:39:24,249
What do you want?
What do you mean,
she's left?

821
01:39:24,334 --> 01:39:27,961
I've been waiting for her
in New York for a week.
I don't mean to pry, but...

822
01:39:28,046 --> 01:39:30,756
What do you mean
you're waiting for her?

823
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:33,967
Who are you,
her boyfriend or something?

824
01:39:34,052 --> 01:39:36,428
Listen, asshole.
You better listen to me.

825
01:39:36,512 --> 01:39:40,807
Don't you ever
call this house again. Ever!

826
01:39:40,892 --> 01:39:42,893
You hear me?

827
01:39:44,854 --> 01:39:46,772
That's strange.
What?

828
01:39:46,856 --> 01:39:51,068
Well, you think if she'd have
gone on tour, she would have
taken her violin.

829
01:39:52,904 --> 01:39:55,405
She has two.

830
01:39:55,490 --> 01:39:57,699
Look, I heard what you were saying
to that guy on the telephone.

831
01:39:57,825 --> 01:40:00,494
I mean, if-
What do you want?

832
01:40:00,578 --> 01:40:04,122
You don't know anything,
so why don't you mind your own business.

833
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:07,751
And don't come back.

834
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:12,547
Oh, Mr. Usher.

835
01:40:12,674 --> 01:40:14,591
You're back.
Just me.

836
01:40:14,676 --> 01:40:18,804
Yeah, Annabel went on tour,
only she didn't take her violin
and she never got there.

837
01:40:18,888 --> 01:40:23,058
Well, uh, will she be away long?

838
01:40:23,142 --> 01:40:26,061
Two or three months.
If they want her longer, who knows.

839
01:40:26,145 --> 01:40:28,939
Don't listen to this guy.
He's a damned liar.

840
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:32,901
Well, I'll miss her.
Your wife and I love to talk together.

841
01:40:33,027 --> 01:40:36,613
You mean Annabel?
Yes.

842
01:40:36,698 --> 01:40:40,951
- She's not my wife.
- Oh? I-I thought...

843
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:43,036
We've lived together for four years,
but we're not married.

844
01:40:43,121 --> 01:40:45,163
Oh.

845
01:40:45,248 --> 01:40:48,750
Well, uh, come on, Gloria.
Excuse us.

846
01:40:48,835 --> 01:40:50,836
Don't worry about it.

847
01:40:53,506 --> 01:40:55,841
And you, stay away.

848
01:40:55,925 --> 01:40:57,968
You're lying, man.

849
01:41:02,598 --> 01:41:05,434
You're lying!

850
01:41:05,518 --> 01:41:08,228
He's lying!

851
01:41:08,312 --> 01:41:10,605
He knows where she is.

852
01:42:13,252 --> 01:42:15,587
I told you not to call back.

853
01:43:03,928 --> 01:43:06,930
Must have gotten inside
while I was building the wall.

854
01:43:48,139 --> 01:43:50,181
Mr. Usher. Hi.

855
01:43:50,308 --> 01:43:53,894
My name's Father Hammer.
I'm your neighbor.
Hello.

856
01:43:55,479 --> 01:43:58,815
It's leaking.
Yeah, it's blood.

857
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:01,318
Oh.
It's a rat.

858
01:44:01,444 --> 01:44:04,279
A big rat.
Where did it come from?

859
01:44:04,363 --> 01:44:07,782
It got into my house,
and I had to kill it.

860
01:44:07,867 --> 01:44:11,995
Huge. I stabbed it a few times,
but, uh, it wouldn't die.

861
01:44:12,079 --> 01:44:14,414
So I had to keep on stabbing it.

862
01:44:14,498 --> 01:44:17,667
- You wanna take a look?
- No. Uh, thanks.

863
01:44:17,793 --> 01:44:20,253
I- I can't stand rats.

864
01:44:20,338 --> 01:44:23,006
I understand.

865
01:45:07,093 --> 01:45:09,094
"Murder."

866
01:45:12,473 --> 01:45:14,808
Let him talk.

867
01:45:30,783 --> 01:45:33,118
- Surprised?
- Not really.

868
01:45:33,202 --> 01:45:36,997
Not really?

869
01:45:37,081 --> 01:45:39,874
False accusations are like the wind.

870
01:45:41,502 --> 01:45:46,131
At least I'm lucky they sent you.
Yeah. Well, we'll see
how lucky you are.

871
01:45:46,215 --> 01:45:49,050
You know, Rod, they mentioned
your name down at the precinct,
and I said,

872
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:52,554
"I know that guy.
He's an artiste."

873
01:45:52,638 --> 01:45:56,016
Let's not stand on ceremony.
Have a seat.

874
01:45:56,100 --> 01:46:00,478
Oh, we like standing.
But we prefer walking.
Check it out.

875
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:09,237
I haven't had breakfast yet,
and I've got a lot of errands to run.

876
01:46:09,321 --> 01:46:11,448
Oh. Well, we won't be long.

877
01:46:17,079 --> 01:46:20,540
Phone's unplugged.
Oh.

878
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:23,918
There have been a lot
of kook calls since
the book came out.

879
01:46:24,045 --> 01:46:26,796
Amateur photographers.

880
01:46:26,922 --> 01:46:29,132
God bless you.
Is there a cat in here?

881
01:46:31,385 --> 01:46:34,637
- There was one, but now it's gone.
- And what happened to it?

882
01:46:36,182 --> 01:46:38,767
Don't tell me you're here
to search for a lost cat.

883
01:46:38,851 --> 01:46:42,729
I asked you something.

884
01:46:42,813 --> 01:46:46,983
It was here for a few days,
and then it disappeared!

885
01:46:47,068 --> 01:46:50,653
Disappeared, huh?
Look, speaking of disappearance, uh, Rod,

886
01:46:50,738 --> 01:46:52,655
what happened to your wife?

887
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:57,327
She's not my wife.

888
01:46:57,411 --> 01:47:01,456
Oh, right, right.
What was her name? Uh, Annabel.

889
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:05,710
What do you mean "was"?
It's still her name.

890
01:47:05,795 --> 01:47:07,879
Well, past tense.

891
01:47:07,963 --> 01:47:10,090
It's a bad habit.

892
01:47:10,174 --> 01:47:13,843
It seems whenever you and I meet,
there's always a body around.

893
01:47:31,195 --> 01:47:33,863
Okay, tell us where she is,
we'll have breakfast delivered.

894
01:47:33,948 --> 01:47:35,949
I don't know!
If I knew, I'd tell you.

895
01:47:42,206 --> 01:47:45,500
She left me.

896
01:47:45,584 --> 01:47:48,086
We spent a couple of days
up at a lake.

897
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:50,505
We couldn't patch things up.

898
01:47:51,674 --> 01:47:55,426
- She has a sister who lives in-
- No, her sister hasn't heard from her.

899
01:47:56,887 --> 01:47:59,430
No wonder.
They don't like each other.

900
01:48:08,065 --> 01:48:09,816
Excuse me.

901
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:13,736
That cat of yours must have
left a lot of fur behind, huh?

902
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:18,533
Say, this is the cat, isn't it, Rod?

903
01:48:21,328 --> 01:48:26,416
You know, Rod, they say that you-
you tortured this cat
to get these pictures.

904
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:28,793
Now you wouldn't do that,
would you?

905
01:48:28,878 --> 01:48:31,129
Say it isn't so, Rod.

906
01:48:31,213 --> 01:48:33,089
It isn't so.

907
01:48:33,174 --> 01:48:35,383
Good.

908
01:48:35,467 --> 01:48:39,387
My kid has a couple
of little kittens. Loves 'em.

909
01:48:39,513 --> 01:48:41,973
Plays with 'em all the time.
Great, Legrand!

910
01:48:42,057 --> 01:48:46,227
- Have Rod take care of 'em
when you go on vacation.

911
01:48:50,107 --> 01:48:55,737
Hello.
This is Joseph.
I called yesterday from New York.

912
01:48:55,821 --> 01:48:59,699
You wish to speak with Mr. Usher.
Sorry, Mr. Usher is not at home.

913
01:49:01,952 --> 01:49:03,870
Pain in the ass
won't leave me alone.
Ah.

914
01:49:03,954 --> 01:49:06,414
Wants some of my pictures.
I have to get an unlisted number.

915
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:11,502
Ah. So Annabel
and the cat took off, huh?
Didn't say where they were going, though.

916
01:49:11,587 --> 01:49:15,131
Cats don't talk.
But Annabel left a note.

917
01:49:15,216 --> 01:49:17,884
It's around here somewhere.

918
01:49:29,313 --> 01:49:31,522
Real love letter.

919
01:49:31,607 --> 01:49:35,068
Why'd you tell the neighbors
that she was going on
an orchestra tour?

920
01:49:35,152 --> 01:49:38,696
I don't have to tell
those busybodies my business.

921
01:49:38,781 --> 01:49:42,492
True. You got any letters
of hers?

922
01:49:42,576 --> 01:49:44,994
This is her picture, isn't it?
Yes.

923
01:49:45,079 --> 01:49:47,830
Do you mind if we take it?
No.

924
01:49:53,712 --> 01:49:57,882
Oh, and you could give me
the book as a present, huh?

925
01:49:57,967 --> 01:49:59,550
Sure.

926
01:49:59,677 --> 01:50:02,345
Thanks, Rod.
You almost coauthored it with me.

927
01:50:05,266 --> 01:50:09,894
Oh, one more thing.
Um, where'd you and Annabel
go on this vacation of yours?

928
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:12,981
To Lake Arthur.
I have a dual house on the shore there.
Uh-huh.

929
01:50:13,065 --> 01:50:16,442
Okay, Rod, thank you.
Let's go.

930
01:50:25,494 --> 01:50:27,996
Gentlemen, I'm glad
your suspicions have been allayed.

931
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:31,624
I wish you a long and happy life.

932
01:50:31,709 --> 01:50:36,629
And what did you expect to find
between these solidly put-together walls?

933
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:49,058
Open up. It's me again.

934
01:50:54,773 --> 01:50:57,275
You forgot to sign it.

935
01:51:05,367 --> 01:51:07,368
Ah.

936
01:51:11,248 --> 01:51:13,583
That's funny.
It was working a minute ago.

937
01:51:18,297 --> 01:51:21,132
I'm sure you got a pen inside.

938
01:51:32,478 --> 01:51:36,856
Hey, Rod, I liked what you said before
about me almost coauthoring
the book with you.

939
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:39,400
Would you sign it like that?

940
01:51:44,281 --> 01:51:46,282
Yeah.

941
01:51:50,287 --> 01:51:52,288
Where's that coming from?

942
01:52:29,993 --> 01:52:33,079
What the fuck are you doing?
Hold it.

943
01:52:33,163 --> 01:52:35,123
What do you got?

944
01:52:41,130 --> 01:52:43,131
Boss.

945
01:52:58,605 --> 01:53:01,774
- It's fresh.
- What'd you say, Rod?

946
01:53:01,859 --> 01:53:05,319
What'd we think
we were gonna find behind
these solidly built walls?

947
01:53:05,404 --> 01:53:07,280
A little guessing game,
huh, Rod?

948
01:53:07,406 --> 01:53:11,909
What do you think?
Break it down?
Sure.

949
01:53:11,994 --> 01:53:14,120
I got just the tool.

950
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:30,803
Well, we found
what we were looking for.

951
01:53:45,319 --> 01:53:49,822
Oh, God! The smell!

952
01:53:49,907 --> 01:53:52,408
Keep going.

953
01:53:55,329 --> 01:53:59,582
It was pregnant.
It had its kittens in there.

954
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:04,587
Tear the whole thing down!

955
01:54:07,966 --> 01:54:11,469
You walled 'em in there!

956
01:55:09,278 --> 01:55:11,988
What's going on here?

957
01:55:12,114 --> 01:55:14,407
What's going on in there?

958
01:55:14,491 --> 01:55:19,036
Open the door!
What's going on in there?

959
01:55:19,121 --> 01:55:21,205
- Let us in!
- Open the door!

960
01:55:23,667 --> 01:55:26,544
What's going on in there?
Do you hear us?

961
01:55:26,670 --> 01:55:29,922
Come on. Open the door!
Open the door!

962
01:55:32,259 --> 01:55:35,469
Let's hurry! Come on. Open it!

963
01:55:35,554 --> 01:55:37,680
Open the door!
