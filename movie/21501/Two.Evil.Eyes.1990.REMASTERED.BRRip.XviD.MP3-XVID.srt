00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,645
70 Edgar Allan poe,

2
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,815
whose stories have inspired
this motion picture.

3
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,195
Is that an accusation, Mr. pike?

4
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,482
Is that some sort of an accusation?

5
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,824
Is that some sort of
an accusation, Mr. pike?

6
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:07,407
- What'd you say?
- Nothing. Nothing.

7
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,494
- I thought you said something.
- No.

8
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,297
I was just talking to myself.
It's nothing.

9
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,667
He's liquidating a substantial
number of his assets here.

10
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:56,882
This represents 15,
possibly 20 percent of his holdings.

11
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:01,177
I wouldn't know. Ernie has never talked
to me much about business.

12
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,255
Perhaps if he'd be willing to wait until...

13
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,011
He can't wait, Mr. pike.

14
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:08,890
The doctors give him three weeks.
Six at the most.

15
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,730
Ernie wants this done now.

16
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,274
With all the proceeds going to you.

17
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,068
- That's right.
- Bad timing.

18
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:21,148
The market price on some of these stocks
is lower than it's been in years.

19
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,027
Why doesn't he simply put
these assets in your name?

20
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:29,161
I don't need assets, Mr. pike.
I need dollars to live on.

21
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:32,914
You've been remembered,
quite generously, in the will.

22
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:36,167
And how long will it take
to settle the estate, Mr. pike?

23
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,382
Eighteen months. Two years.

24
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,630
- Depending on...
- What do I do while I'm waiting?

25
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,383
Take a job as a waitress?

26
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,926
I'm not society, Mr. pike.

27
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,678
I have nothing of my own.

28
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:52,517
I was a flight attendant
that Ernie brought home off the red-eye...

29
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:56,691
To the shock and dismay of you
and everyone else in this town.

30
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,815
I married a rich, old man.

31
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,865
I let him use me...
For pleasure and for show.

32
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,453
Now I'm going to let him
pay me for my services.

33
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,340
This is Ernest's signature?

34
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,596
Is that some sort of
an accusation, Mr. pike?

35
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,278
Hello, Ernie. Yes.

36
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,153
Yes. I'm here with Steven pike.

37
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:53,081
I gave him the papers.
I don't think he likes it very much.

38
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,292
“Well...

39
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,461
Are you sure you're up to it?

40
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,131
All right. I'll put him on.

41
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,640
- Hello, Ernest.
- Hello, Steven.

42
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,057
How are you feeling? How's the pain?

43
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,016
Are you feeling much pain?

44
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,023
No. No pain.

45
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,448
Listen, Ernest.

46
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,992
I have these papers here,
the ones you sent.

47
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,531
Yes?

48
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,031
Are you sure you want to do this?

49
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,081
Have you thought this through?

50
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,832
Yes. I want fo do it Steven.

51
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,164
[I owe it fo Jessica.

52
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,420
- Hello?
- Yes?

53
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,753
- Who is this?
- I'm Steven pike, Mr. Valdemar's attorney.

54
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,339
Bob Hoffman, Mr. pike. I'm Ernie's doctor.

55
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:54,017
Look. Is all this really necessary?
Uh, emies...

56
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,844
Well, he needs as much rest as he can get.

57
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,770
So, unless this is
something really urgent...

58
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:03,569
Well, Ernest is asking me
to do something a bit, uh, unorthodox.

59
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:07,239
Something that's, uh,
very unlike him to do.

60
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:11,944
People with Ernest's prognosis
will often do surprising things, Mr. pike.

61
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,404
I can assure you his mind
ls as sharp as ever.

62
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,036
I see. I see. Thank you, doctor. I...

63
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,584
I hope I haven't disturbed him too much.

64
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,411
I just don't want him agitated.
That's all

65
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,669
- I'm sure you understand.
- Yes. Yes, of course. Yes, uh...

66
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,000
- Good-bye, doctor.
- Good-bye.

67
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,846
I'll prepare the necessary forms

68
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,928
and mail them to you
for Ernest's signature.

69
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,981
Well, I wouldn't want any delays.
I'll stop by and pick them up.

70
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,022
Tomorrow morning.
They'll be ready, I hope?

71
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,604
- They'll be ready.
- Thank you.

72
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,114
Have a nice day, Mr. pike.

73
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,065
- God, he's still...
- Still under.

74
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,739
Still completely at my command.

75
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,531
Valdemar.

76
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,116
Repeat these words.

77
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,911
I want to do it.

78
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,417
I owe it to Jessica.

79
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:32,926
I want to do it. I owe it to Jessica.

80
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,753
Wake him up.

81
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,512
To the pain?
To the realization that he's dying?

82
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,677
He's better off where he is.

83
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,563
Besides,

84
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,350
I thought if we let him sleep,

85
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,772
we might be able to have some time,
liquidate a few assets of our own.

86
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,654
Robert! What if he...
“What? What if he hears me?

87
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,406
Well, I'm sure he can. Valdemar.

88
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,946
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

89
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,662
- I hear you.
- Fascinating.

90
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:08,371
Somewhere deep in his consciousness
he knows exactly what we're doing to him.

91
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,506
But when I wake him, it'll all disappear.

92
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,001
Like the fragments of a dream.

93
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,506
I don't find it fascinating.

94
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,346
It's morbid.

95
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,096
Frightening.

96
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,894
I'm not as... vindictive as you are.

97
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,691
I don't take any pleasure out of this.

98
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:36,065
He's a ruthless old man who treats people
as if they were possessions.

99
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,276
He spent his life taking whatever
he wanted without a care for anyone else.

100
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,784
He took you away from me.
Vindictive? Yes. Yes, I am vindictive.

101
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,786
He didn't take me. I went.

102
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,146
He didn't know I was seeing you.

103
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,065
He doesn't even realize
we knew each other bef...

104
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:53,048
- Ll want you back, Jess.
- Robert. Please. I can't.

105
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,840
Not now. I couldn't.

106
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,716
I-I'm having a very
difficult time with this. I...

107
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:04,676
I need you to try to be sensitive to that,
try to understand how hard this is for me.

108
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,709
- If you want me to go through with it...
- You already have gone through with this.

109
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,348
There's no turning back anymore.

110
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,443
What are you gonna tell Mr. pike?
"Oh, this has all been a misunderstanding.

111
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,819
I didn't realize my husband
was under hypnosis

112
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,647
when I asked him to sign the papers.”

113
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,108
You won't like it in prison, Jessica.
The food's awful.

114
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,241
And let's call a spade a spade, all right?

115
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,495
This was your idea, not mine.
I was willing to wait.

116
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,873
I just wanted us to be together again,
but that wasn't good enough, was it?

117
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,080
Not after you got a taste
of what it was to be rich.

118
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,111
You're going to pretend
you don't care about the money?

119
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,500
No. Of course I want the money,

120
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,006
but I want you too,
and I thought you wanted me.

121
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,212
I do.

122
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,348
Robert, I do. Uh...

123
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,517
It's just difficult...

124
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,770
Difficult to care about someone
you know is a thief?

125
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:52,985
I know.

126
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,651
I have the same problem.

127
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:09,074
Valdemar. I'm going to wake you now.

128
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,792
When I count to five,

129
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,460
you will be completely awake and alert.

130
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,759
One.

131
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,509
You will not remember anything.

132
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,344
Two. You're starting
to regain your senses.

133
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,810
Three. Starting to see the room.

134
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,513
Starting to see me.

135
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,106
Four.

136
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,646
Oh, god! The pain!

137
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,114
God. Can't you help him?

138
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,243
He'll be asleep soon.
He's had his injection.

139
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,615
There's not much else I can do.

140
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,948
You could stay with him.
That's what you're being paid for.

141
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,908
You should have him in a hospital.

142
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,498
A man in his advanced state.

143
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:58,127
Keeping him at home.
I have never seen anything like it.

144
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,880
In all my years of nursing,
I've never seen anything like it.

145
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,648
Where is
that bitch of a wife of mine?

146
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,896
Where is she?

147
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,028
Out spending my money.

148
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,865
Where is she? Where...

149
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,028
Jessical

150
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,325
jessical

151
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,165
jessical

152
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,094
Jessical

153
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,021
Two of the money market accounts
are with the local bank.

154
00:12:56,109 --> 00:13:00,193
Those funds are available to you now.
See Mr. Pratt.

155
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,896
The rest is going to take some time.

156
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,149
- How much time?
- Paperwork, mails,

157
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,360
out-of-town checks will have to clear.

158
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,445
Two to three weeks.

159
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,293
If anything should happen to Ernest,

160
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,746
you'll have a hard time collecting,
I'm afraid.

161
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,544
So do your best to keep him alive,
won't you?

162
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,968
- I'll do my best.
- I'm sure you will.

163
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:38,982
This is quite a lot to be walking
around with in cash, Mrs. Valdemar.

164
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,309
Now, we do offer a liquid asset account

165
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,269
that would allow you
to withdraw any amount...

166
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,044
I'll be wanting to talk to you about that.

167
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:48,608
I'll be coming into quite a large sum
in the next few weeks.

168
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,659
Something over three million, I'm told.

169
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:55,540
And, of course, I'll be wanting to put it
someplace where it will be safe.

170
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,711
But this... I have a need for this in cash.

171
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,753
Whatever you say, Mrs. Valdemar.

172
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,127
Whenever you're ready,
just give me a call.

173
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,005
We're, uh... we're here to please.

174
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,699
That's good enough, Martha. You can go.

175
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,779
- We've not done the upstairs yet, Mrs. v.
- It doesn't need to be done.

176
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,535
It's fine. Really.
You can get it next time.

177
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,162
If you say so, mum.

178
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,915
All right, people.
Let's pack it up. We're leaving.

179
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,123
Mr. v seems in a bad way today, mum.

180
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,550
Yes. He's, uh, been bad for some time now.

181
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:52,472
Poor old soul. Night nurse left,
and I didn't know what to do.

182
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,674
I'm sorry. I didn't expect
to be gone so long.

183
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,181
That's all right. Doctor's with him now.

184
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,011
Oh, he's here? Good.

185
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,654
Sign your name, Valdemar.
Sign your name on the line.

186
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,833
Again, Valdemar.

187
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,796
Here. On the line.

188
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,752
Sign your name again.

189
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,772
Done.

190
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,900
- Is he...
- Still under.

191
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,365
Come here.

192
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,244
Are you sure you want to?

193
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,332
Yes.

194
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,669
What did you put in the safe, Jesse?

195
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,796
The safe?

196
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,420
When you came in.

197
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,840
I saw you put something
in the safe. What was it?

198
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,175
Money.

199
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,436
- You got the money.
- Some.

200
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,983
- Just a little.
- How much is a little?

201
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,146
I don't know. A few thousand.

202
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,574
None of it mine, I suppose.

203
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,157
I'll have the rest in a few weeks.

204
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,830
Oh. Nothing for me
until the job is finished.

205
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,953
Is that it?

206
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,993
That's not fair.

207
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,879
I haven't gotten anything
out of this, Jess.

208
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,252
Soon.

209
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,797
In a few weeks.

210
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,962
In a few weeks we'll have it all.

211
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,632
Just think of it. A million dollars.

212
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,641
A million dollars for us to share.

213
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,984
Mine in cash. Remember?

214
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,359
No checks.

215
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,865
- Nothing with my name on it.
- Ah, don't worry.

216
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:05,080
- Nothing to connect us.
- There's nothing to connect us.

217
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,876
Nothing at all to connect us.

218
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,260
It's Ernest.

219
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:47,949
Oh, my god.

220
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,073
Keep him alive for a few more weeks.
That's what pike said you had to do.

221
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,571
That's what we're going to do.
No one needs to know he died here tonight.

222
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,044
We wait till the money comes through.
Then he dies a few days later.

223
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,924
Won't he have to be examined?

224
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:47,057
By a doctor. That's me.
I'll sign the death certificate.

225
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,012
- What about the funeral?
- Closed coffin.

226
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,145
- Cremation.
- We can't just do that ourselves.

227
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,568
No. State law.
It has to be someone licensed.

228
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,945
We don't have to have him embalmed,

229
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,149
but the body does have to be handled.

230
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,743
In three weeks he'll be...

231
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,286
Yes. He'll be melted.

232
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,042
Unless...

233
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,336
In your basement.

234
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,128
You can't be serious.

235
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,253
How badly do you want this, Jess?

236
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,253
Oh, god.

237
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:05,674
Jess, give me a hand.
You gotta give me a hand here, Jess.

238
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,180
Try to free the arm.

239
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,223
Get the arm off the banister there.

240
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,055
Jesse, for god's sake, I'm losing him!

241
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,452
It's the nurse.

242
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,498
- Answer it.
- No.

243
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:41,389
If you don't answer it, she'll be
bugging us all night. Get rid of her.

244
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:58,522
Uh, I... I should have called you.
I'm sorry. Uh, I won't be needing you.

245
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,525
I came all this way.

246
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,812
I'm gonna have to charge you for my time.

247
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,406
Will you be wanting me tomorrow?

248
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,150
No. Uh...

249
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:13,867
Actually, I have decided
to take your advice.

250
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,791
[-I'm... I'm putting Mr. Valdemar
into a hospital.

251
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:20,370
- I won't be needing you anymore.
- Well, it is about time.

252
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,170
A man in his advanced state.

253
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,504
I'm here. I would be happy
to look in on him.

254
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,256
Uh, no. Uh, the doctor's
with him right now.

255
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,929
Well, I'm sorry to lose the work,

256
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,383
but I am glad to see that
you are finally doing the right thing.

257
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,970
I'll see that they send you
an adjusted bill.

258
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,395
- Good night.
- Good night.

259
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,723
Thank you... for all your help.

260
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,501
What if we need more signatures?

261
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,924
I've done enough.
You can do the forging.

262
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,139
You better practice, just in case.

263
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,060
What if pike calls, wants to talk to him?

264
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,066
No phone calls. Doctor's orders.

265
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,949
- What if he comes to the house?
- He won't.

266
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,765
He gives you a hard time, but underneath
it all, he doesn't give a shit.

267
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,371
As long as he gets his fees,
that's all he cares about.

268
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,287
That's all anybody
ever cares about in the end.

269
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,371
- Money.
- Yeah.

270
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,498
Has a way, doesn't it?

271
00:23:56,936 --> 00:24:01,100
All taken care of:
400,000 in a liquid asset account.

272
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,057
There's your checkbook. And...

273
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,109
Another 100,000 for you here.

274
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:13,024
Do you mind if I ask what use
you could possibly have for all this cash?

275
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,484
I do mind, Mr. Pratt.
It's private business.

276
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:53,045
You scared the hell out of me.

277
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:56,923
- What are you doing down here?
- I... I thought I heard something.

278
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,050
It sounded...

279
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,557
It sounded like Ernest.

280
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,432
Come on. Come away from there.

281
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,104
Stay with me tonight.

282
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,020
- Jess, you gotta get a hold of yourself.
- Robert, please.

283
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:23,071
I can't be alone here anymore.
I can't stand being alone here.

284
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:28,205
All right. I'll stay.

285
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,090
You're not gonna freak out on me, are you?

286
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,096
You're gonna be able to get through this.

287
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,178
Because if you're not, tell me now,

288
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,268
so I can pull out
and start covering my tracks.

289
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:54,318
He said, in his typically kind
and understanding way.

290
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,488
I am sorry, Robert,
if I am not strong enough for you.

291
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:02,113
I didn't go to medical school. I haven't
spent a lot of time around cadavers.

292
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,895
What are you doing?

293
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,812
I'm going to sleep.
You should do the same.

294
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,176
I can give you something, if you like.

295
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,782
God, no. After all that gin, you'd drop.

296
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,617
I should teach you how to do this.
Self-hypnosis. It's better than any pill.

297
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,270
You know, you won't be able to wake me.

298
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:54,162
So if you think you might change your mind
and want to mess around...

299
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,747
- I won't be able to wake you?
- When you're hypnotized,

300
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,333
you can only be wakened
by the voice that put you under.

301
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,031
When you hypnotize yourself,
there's no such voice.

302
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,967
- I need to have you with me.
- I am with you.

303
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,094
If I can't wake you...

304
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,268
I have got to get some sleep.

305
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:13,059
I have an early appointment.
I've been neglecting my practice.

306
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,141
You're not the only one
that's strung out, Jess.

307
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:18,602
The last few weeks haven't exactly
been a vacation for me either.

308
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,906
I'm here. I'm with you.
Nothing is gonna happen.

309
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,906
I'm just gonna sleep for a few hours.

310
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,181
Robert.

311
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,900
Robert.

312
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,985
Bastard.

313
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,010
Robert.

314
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,847
Goddamn you.

315
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,357
Robert. Robert.

316
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:09,611
Wake up! Robert, wake up! Robert!

317
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,552
He's still alive.

318
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,227
Here. Here.
Take a look at him. See for yourself.

319
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,613
Come down here, Jessica, and look at him.

320
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,238
Just take one look at him,
then tell me you think he's still alive.

321
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,364
I can't.

322
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,505
Uh, Valdemar?

323
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,464
Are you there?

324
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,055
Yes.

325
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:31,530
Valdemar, uh, are you still, uh...

326
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,698
Sleeping.

327
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,485
Sleeping?

328
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,578
Yes.

329
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,369
No.

330
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,998
I have been sleeping,

331
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,579
and now...

332
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:51,588
I am dead.

333
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,215
Oh, mother of god.

334
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,095
Valdemar.

335
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:08,726
Valdemar.

336
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,238
Valdemar, can you hear me?

337
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,538
Nothing. Over an hour, and nothing more.

338
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:34,252
It's a trick. It... it's a recorded voice.

339
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,675
- Someone's doing this to us. Pike.
- Oh, please.

340
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:40,678
- It's either that, or he's still alive.
- He's dead, Jessica.

341
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,681
There's no vital signs.
He's frozen solid, for Christ's sake.

342
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,561
I don't know.
I mean, I don't know what's going on here.

343
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:52,986
All I can think is that he was
hypnotized when he died, so...

344
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:56,236
Somehow we're still able
to communicate with him.

345
00:33:58,328 --> 00:33:59,784
It seems impossible, but...

346
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,238
There's no other explanation
that makes any sense.

347
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,580
Here. Here.

348
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:14,166
Take two of these now,
and take another at 11:00.

349
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:15,626
And lay off the liquor.

350
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,130
- You're not leaving.
- I have to.

351
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,806
Robert, you can't.

352
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,259
I have an endoscopy at 8:00.

353
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:27,250
They're prepping the patient right now.
I've canceled this guy three times.

354
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:28,559
You can't do this to me.

355
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,771
We are felons, Jessica.

356
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,853
We have committed grand larceny here

357
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:38,111
and fraud and god knows what else.

358
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,783
The last thing we need to do
is to arouse suspicion.

359
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,532
We have to maintain an air of, uh...

360
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,530
An air of normality?

361
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,123
Look.

362
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,876
Uh, I'll leave early.
I'll be back here by 2:30.

363
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:57,380
You don't have to stay in the house.
Go outside. Get some air.

364
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,927
Take the pills, and calm yourself.

365
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,010
Take the pills, Jessica.

366
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,065
No booze, Jessica.

367
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,240
Here.

368
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:23,864
Let me see you take 'em.

369
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,588
I'm terrified.

370
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,339
I know...

371
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,428
I'm sorry.

372
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,469
I shouldn't be so, uh...

373
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,223
We'll be all right.

374
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,150
Just try to think logically.

375
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,442
There's a logical explanation
for everything.

376
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,485
There's a logical explanation
for everything.

377
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:23,007
Oh, yeah? There is
no such thing as monsters.

378
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,405
Are you comfortable?

379
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,033
Yes.

380
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:50,247
Do you have any more pain?

381
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,202
No.

382
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,497
No pain.

383
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:01,542
Are you comfortable?

384
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,843
Yes.

385
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:09,391
Do you have any more pain?

386
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:13,390
No. No pain.

387
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,014
Where are you, Valdemar?

388
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,526
Can you see anything? Can you...

389
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,733
- Tell me what you see?
- Lights.

390
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,568
Very bright.

391
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,862
Very far...

392
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,539
In the distance.

393
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,701
Can't reach them.

394
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,872
Where I am, it is dark.

395
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,176
Dark. Cold.

396
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,598
Very cold.

397
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:54,636
Help me, jessical

398
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:56,016
god.

399
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:59,850
- Jesse?
- No. No...

400
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,606
Christ. Don't go
spooking around like that.

401
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,029
Others.

402
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,991
There are others.

403
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,787
- Others?
- Many...

404
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,002
Many others.

405
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,921
Looking at me.

406
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,424
Watching me.

407
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,261
They want something.

408
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,848
These, uh, others...

409
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,804
Can you see them?

410
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,934
What do they look like? Who are they?

411
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,271
Valdemar.

412
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:45,854
Valdemar.

413
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:14,391
Where I am, it is dark.

414
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,970
Dark. Cold.

415
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,811
Very cold.

416
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,529
There is consciousness after death.

417
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:38,959
Others.

418
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,164
He said there were...

419
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,462
Others.

420
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,477
Fook advantage of
end-of-model-year incentives.

421
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,105
If that sector is stripped away,
retail sales for August

422
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,478
were up a much slimmer two-tenths percent.

423
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,435
Still, for the year thus far,

424
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:12,365
sales are up 5.9 percent
from the first eight months of 1986.

425
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:14,067
James limbaugh, Washington.

426
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,557
7he market continued fo
fo be the victim of sell programs

427
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:17,991
and profit-taking today,

428
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,370
as the first of many economic reports,
this one on retail sales, was...

429
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:28,544
Help me!

430
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,551
Valdemar, I'm here.

431
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,299
I'm with you.

432
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,218
Help me.

433
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,646
What... what can I do?

434
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,104
Wake me.

435
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:51,271
- Wake you?
- I am dead.

436
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,607
Let me go.

437
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:59,575
Wake me and let me go.

438
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,970
Wake you? Of course.

439
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:25,221
You're still... you're still hypnotized.
If I wake you...

440
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,183
I will be released.

441
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:32,479
Quickly. The others.

442
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,110
The others are coming.

443
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,573
I am part of both worlds.

444
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:43,581
Theirs and yours.

445
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:46,034
They want to use me

446
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:48,085
to pass through.

447
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:52,586
To pass through. They're coming.

448
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:56,090
Wake me. Wake me before...

449
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:03,729
It's over.

450
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,358
It's finished.

451
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,815
How could you do this?

452
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,325
How in the hell could you do this?

453
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,284
What are we supposed to do now, Jessica?

454
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,749
How do we explain
two bullet holes in his body

455
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:29,452
when he is supposed
to have died of natural causes?

456
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,959
We don't have to explain anything.
We're gonna bury him.

457
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,254
- Bury him.
- In the woods, out back.

458
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,345
Oh...

459
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,092
We'll say we took him
somewhere else for the funeral.

460
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,841
- His hometown. Harrisburg.
- Oh, Christ.

461
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,722
We have money, Robert.
It's just like you said.

462
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,516
People won't ask too many questions.

463
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:51,395
They'll cooperate,
as long as there's enough money.

464
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:54,228
I'm a living example of that.
God, I never should have...

465
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:57,610
We have to bury him, Robert.
It's the only way to be rid of this.

466
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,574
He asked me to...

467
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:08,408
Let him go, to wake him.

468
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:12,121
He was not dead.
He couldn't have been dead.

469
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:13,917
It's not possible.

470
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:18,543
Somehow the hypnosis kept him alive.

471
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,253
What if he's still...

472
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:22,933
How can we bury him

473
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:26,009
- if there's still a chance that he might...
- We have no choice, Robert.

474
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:28,261
We have no choice.

475
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,149
You have no choice.

476
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,149
If they find out about me,
they'll find out about you.

477
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,730
I'll deny it.

478
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:41,157
I'll deny everything.

479
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:44,490
Deny you talked to pike?

480
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:52,391
Robert?

481
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,211
Robert?

482
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:26,254
Robert, is that you?

483
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:32,811
They're coming for you, Jessica.

484
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,397
They're coming for you.

485
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,901
They don't want me...

486
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:45,573
To go into the ground.

487
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,660
Oh!

488
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,766
It isn't me, Jessica.

489
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,183
It's the others.

490
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:29,776
It's the others, Jessica.

491
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:33,613
Using my body.

492
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:40,582
I asked you to help me.

493
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,457
You should have helped me.

494
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:49,546
Now it's too late!

495
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:07,835
Valdemar.

496
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:10,547
I'm gonna wake you, Valdemar!

497
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,048
I'm gonna count to five.

498
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,889
One! Two!

499
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:19,803
Three! Four!

500
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,728
Five!

501
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,816
It's too late.

502
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:35,743
The others...

503
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,491
The others.

504
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:42,663
Without me, they can't return.

505
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:52,590
They're with you now.

506
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,339
They're with you.

507
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,899
Come on. Let's go. Nice night...

508
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:57,817
- Watch that umbrella.
- Come on. We got one over here.

509
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,862
All right.
Let 'em through here. Let 'em through.

510
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,082
That's good right there.

511
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:13,753
Come on.

512
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,207
Guess she was gonna bury him back here.

513
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:27,438
She couldn't have dug
that grave by herself.

514
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,484
We figure she popped him,
then shot herself.

515
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:35,150
Very strange things though.

516
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,072
We found blood in the freezer
down in the cellar.

517
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,491
Christ.

518
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,202
Rich people.

519
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:45,452
The sick stuff always turns out
to be rich people.

520
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:50,164
- She had him in the freezer, huh?
- That's what we think.

521
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:55,420
And there was blood in the freezer.

522
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,384
So she had him down there
after he was shot.

523
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,259
- Looks that way.
- So how'd he get up here?

524
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,260
That's what we're asking ourselves.

525
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:07,098
Wait. Wait till you get a load of this.

526
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:13,897
Oh, my god.

527
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,146
This guy's been dead for weeks.

528
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,949
- Hey, 9-1-1?
- Yeah.

529
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:56,208
It's god-awful. Screaming, crying,
like somebody's in some real pain.

530
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:00,795
- How long's this been going on?
- A week. Two weeks maybe.

531
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,753
Long enough to have the rest of us
in the building crazy over it.

532
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:07,431
Couldn't get anyone to do anything
about it. You know how people are.

533
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:09,474
Shit. It's driving me to drink.

534
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:13,145
- I'm the guy who called 9-1-1.
- Well, you did the right thing.

535
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:19,859
Police, Hoffman! Open up!

536
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:27,704
Hit it.

537
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:38,079
Hoffman?

538
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:21,960
What'd I tell you? Another rich guy.
Call in the troops.

539
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,651
Help.

540
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:54,158
There's no one to wake me.

541
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:57,950
No one to wake me.

542
00:54:58,045 --> 00:54:59,080
What?

543
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:03,130
Oh! Oh!

544
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:07,251
No!

545
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:12,180
Oh!

546
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:24,189
It's the depravity that's in all of us.

547
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:32,277
Perversity is one of
the prime impulses of the heart.

548
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,161
Who's never done something wrong

549
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:37,206
- just because it was forbidden?
- Watch your step there.

550
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,908
70 be evil only for the love
of being evil.

551
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:45,168
Sir, do you think there's
any chance of me being transferred

552
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:47,466
back to parking violations?

553
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:50,962
No. I... I don't want any dinner, O'Neill.

554
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,842
Maybe just some coffee.

555
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:55,891
No, sir. I was asking about a transfer.

556
00:55:55,978 --> 00:56:00,017
- Out. Oh, I'm real impressed. Out.
- This is a pass to come in here.

557
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,835
- Can you read english?
- I can read english.

558
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:04,087
I can read any language you want.
You don't come in with one of those.

559
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:06,067
I want the police!
I want to see the police!

560
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,758
What's the matter, rod? You
having a little problem with the bouncer?

561
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,301
- He's all right.
- There's the police.

562
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,325
Be my guest.

563
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:19,490
How is it you get sent down
on every one of these, huh?

564
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,791
Still life is my specialty.

565
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,378
Already get him?

566
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:29,174
Yeah, this morning.
Bastard was asleep, right next to her.

567
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:34,255
- So who was the first one on the scene?
- Valenz.

568
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,329
Man! Oh!

569
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:59,822
Hey, Usher.
Who the hell told you to pull that lever?

570
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:04,535
You trying to get somebody killed?
Somebody stop this thing.

571
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,996
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.

572
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:13,085
Look at him taking pictures, will ya?

573
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:18,015
What's the big hurry, Usher?
Stiff's not going anywhere.

574
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:54,047
Where did you come from?

575
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:58,926
How did you get in here?

576
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:03,685
Oh. You have to get off the paper.
Come on.

577
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:09,308
How did you get in here? How did you...

578
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,218
- What did you do to her?
- What did I do to her?

579
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,448
Look what she did to me.

580
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:18,867
“Whose cat is it?

581
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:22,196
Did you scratch him?

582
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:25,040
You mustn't do that. He's very fragile.

583
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:27,960
- Where did she come from?
- She's ours.

584
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,245
I found her outside.

585
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:34,421
You were so hungry, weren't you?
But I'll take care of you.

586
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,877
Isn't she pretty?

587
00:58:36,972 --> 00:58:38,692
She has a beautiful white spot
on her chest.

588
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:42,683
We can keep her, can't we?

589
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:47,725
Sure, honey.

590
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,233
Good.

591
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,329
- What is it?
- The cat.

592
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,412
- I think it's staring at me.
- My brave lover.

593
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,819
Yeah, well, what if it decides to jump up
here in the middle of the night

594
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:59,129
and claw my eyes out?

595
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,903
Better? Hmm?

596
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,960
I can be brave when I have to.

597
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:46,636
I see a lot of terrible things
in my work. You don't know.

598
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,600
You're superstitious.

599
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,187
I think it's 'cause she's a black cat.

600
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,728
You know where those superstitions began,
don't you? It was in the middle ages.

601
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:05,613
Inquisitors burned women and black cats
'cause they thought they were witches.

602
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:08,070
Finally, there weren't
many black cats left.

603
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:12,449
Cats remember, so they don't trust.

604
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:23,646
No, that's "b" natural.

605
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,740
Good.

606
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:26,384
Try the whole thing from the beginning.

607
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,408
Three, four.

608
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:23,936
What happened? I heard her screaming.

609
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:26,643
I accidentally caught her tail
in the door.

610
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:28,945
She's all right.
By the way, what's her name?

611
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:30,984
It's a secret.

612
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:41,078
Don't hurt her.

613
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,385
News international, Joe Wilson.

614
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:56,594
That fire on oak street? Yeah, we've had
a man down there since 9:00.

615
01:04:56,684 --> 01:05:00,518
- Are you saying you don't like it?
- No, I'm not saying that at all.

616
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:04,097
No, I... the crime photos are terrific.
They're startling.

617
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:07,935
I... I'm just saying contrast.
Contrast, that's all I'm saying.

618
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,186
But there's contrast here.

619
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:13,364
Rod, look. You know what
I'm talking about here.

620
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:17,535
Now, shots with the same tone,
but something other than crime photos.

621
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,704
Show the skeptics you really have an eye.

622
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,119
No, he hasn't checked in yet.

623
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:25,501
Don't worry about it.
Okay, I'll take care of it.

624
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:27,795
Usher, you got a job downtown!

625
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:29,622
- Thanks, reverend.
- Bye, reverend.

626
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,800
See you next week.

627
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,642
That's a good pussycat.

628
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:12,983
Good pussycat.

629
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,071
Yes, you're a...

630
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:24,005
How 'bout fixing me something to eat?

631
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:27,558
I'm here. The cat's not.

632
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:33,317
Hello?

633
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:34,985
Hi, Anne.

634
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:39,236
No, I haven't heard anything at all.
I'm frantic about it.

635
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,611
No, not really.

636
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:46,278
I will. Thank you.

637
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:49,781
Don't you think this is a bit much?

638
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:53,292
I mean, your friends are calling you

639
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:57,622
like it's some sort of
a fucking personal crisis.

640
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:02,885
Christ. You'd think
your child had been kidnapped.

641
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:04,883
I don't have a child.

642
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:10,289
Why don't you go and drink somewhere else?

643
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:14,397
Hey. This is my fucking kitchen.

644
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:16,315
And I'll fucking stay.

645
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:19,769
And I'll fucking drink if I fucking want!

646
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:26,947
I didn't fucking do anything!

647
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:30,749
Hello?

648
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:33,116
Hello, Christian.

649
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:37,169
No, I'm fine. Did you practice?

650
01:09:38,216 --> 01:09:40,832
Good. No, not yet.

651
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:44,799
Listen, I can't really talk right now.
Okay? I'll talk to you later.

652
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:52,135
I know you killed her.

653
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:59,021
What, uh, are you talking about?
You are crazy. Do you know that?

654
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,566
It's a fucking cat.

655
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:04,898
A cat!

656
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,363
- You killed her.
- And I didn't kill her!

657
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:09,973
- Yes, you did. You killed her.
- I didn't!

658
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:11,828
Yes, you did.

659
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:17,577
Don't you ever, ever hit me!

660
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,601
No!

661
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:25,027
Rod.

662
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:30,362
Come on. Come on.

663
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:38,791
Oh, rod.

664
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:44,212
Rod.

665
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:48,709
Come on, rod.

666
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:55,349
Rod.

667
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:00,304
Come on.

668
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:37,614
J look what I got in the forest &

669
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:39,320
j look what I have for you j

670
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:42,999
j look what I got in the forest
look what I have for you &

671
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:55,754
Say it, my sweet.

672
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:58,260
Who is thy murderer?

673
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,240
Rod?

674
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:24,452
Rod?

675
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:31,915
Burn him! Burn him!

676
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:38,630
Kill him!

677
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:45,390
Your punishment is written here
in this white spot.

678
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,849
That is your destiny.
Where is it written?

679
01:14:50,945 --> 01:14:52,230
There's nothing written.

680
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:53,985
Do you see it?

681
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,031
Do you see the Mark?

682
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:06,616
Death! Give him death!

683
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:27,929
Get him!

684
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:43,634
Okay, take it easy.

685
01:16:46,477 --> 01:16:49,514
Okay, get your hands off that.
On his feet.

686
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:53,264
Come on. On your feet, asshole.

687
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:57,022
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Flunk out of dental school or what?

688
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:58,728
It was his cousin.

689
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:00,730
You know why he did it?

690
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:03,232
To pull her teeth out.

691
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:05,571
All 32 of 'em.

692
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:10,615
How can a man
do something like that?

693
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:13,371
I'll never figure it out.

694
01:17:18,509 --> 01:17:19,749
Come on. Get in.

695
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:22,673
Come on. Get in, all right?

696
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:24,378
- Get in.
- But I didn't finish!

697
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:28,143
Say, rod.

698
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:31,348
Hey, you might wanna get a shot of this.

699
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:38,560
What is it, Usher? You all right?

700
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:42,021
- Yeah.
- Hey, I'm sorry.

701
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:46,860
No, no. I just have a little bit
of a hangover. Open the box.

702
01:17:46,954 --> 01:17:48,740
- You sure?
- Yeah.

703
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:21,018
Annabel, what's wrong?

704
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:25,898
Look, is it your cat?
I know she's gonna come home soon.

705
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:32,617
God, you're beautiful.

706
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:43,801
Kiss me.

707
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:45,645
Joseph, I don't even...
I don't even know how to say this.

708
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,151
It's like I'm living in a nightmare...

709
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:50,323
And he's a stranger.

710
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:54,862
The pictures in this book,
I can't believe it.

711
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:57,323
Listen, can you find me a place
in New York?

712
01:19:58,252 --> 01:19:59,867
Yes, I can go anytime.

713
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:02,627
I just have to get out of here.

714
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:04,830
Can you help me?

715
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:10,753
Will you call me?

716
01:20:13,851 --> 01:20:15,682
Oh, god, I'm frightened.

717
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:21,347
I'm frightened.

718
01:20:57,269 --> 01:21:01,603
What... what is there south of heaven?
What's... what's south of heaven?

719
01:21:02,024 --> 01:21:05,357
Ever read Dante's divine comedy?

720
01:21:07,488 --> 01:21:09,649
The canticles of the last judgment?

721
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:13,028
- No.
- The texts...

722
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,821
Of the reincarnation of chic.

723
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:19,447
Are you not gonna tell me
'cause I haven't?

724
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,657
No.

725
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:24,576
But you can try and guess.

726
01:21:46,276 --> 01:21:48,267
What's the matter?
You don't like cats, pal?

727
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:50,648
- Is it yours?
- No.

728
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:53,321
It just kind of wandered in
a couple days ago.

729
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:56,446
She was hungry. I fed her.
I'm a sucker for animals.

730
01:21:57,871 --> 01:21:59,077
Want another shot?

731
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:08,371
My girlfriend had a cat
that looked just like that one.

732
01:22:08,966 --> 01:22:10,376
Maybe it's hers.

733
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:14,460
- Like I said, she just wandered in.
- No.

734
01:22:14,555 --> 01:22:16,386
Hers is dead.

735
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:20,550
Strange how she's looking at you.

736
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:23,435
Why don't you pet her?

737
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:27,686
Hell, she's probably
your girlfriend's cat.

738
01:22:28,902 --> 01:22:30,438
See this white spot?

739
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:33,111
Does your girlfriend's cat
have a spot like that?

740
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:34,904
There's a little design in it.

741
01:22:35,534 --> 01:22:36,740
What design?

742
01:22:37,744 --> 01:22:38,904
Do you see it?

743
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:42,784
Do you see the Mark?

744
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:49,453
You can hardly see it, but...

745
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:54,800
If you want to,
we can look at it together.

746
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:57,424
- No.
- My name's eleonora.

747
01:22:58,599 --> 01:23:01,841
No. Thanks.

748
01:23:03,187 --> 01:23:04,267
Whatever.

749
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:07,892
Hello?

750
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,314
Annabel?

751
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:10,401
Joseph.

752
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:12,772
Good news. I found you a place to stay

753
01:23:12,863 --> 01:23:15,479
and I got some info
on some possible teaching positions.

754
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:17,110
Oh, that's great.

755
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:20,193
It's just a small place
for a couple of weeks, but it's a start.

756
01:23:20,287 --> 01:23:23,029
I don't care. I don't care what it is,
as long as I get out of here.

757
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:25,956
Listen, I'm gonna try to get
a flight tonight.

758
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:28,643
Okay, call me with
your flight info and I'll pick you up.

759
01:23:28,712 --> 01:23:29,792
I will.

760
01:24:04,581 --> 01:24:05,912
Where is the cat?

761
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:12,161
Will you sell her to me?

762
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,338
Why not? Where is she?

763
01:24:25,352 --> 01:24:26,558
I put her in here.

764
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:34,395
I knew you'd come back for her.

765
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:37,690
She's been waiting for you.

766
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:41,736
- For me?
- Yes.

767
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:46,236
It's marvelous.

768
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:51,830
It's your destiny. She's pregnant.

769
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:30,655
Oh, sweetheart. Yes, I'm here.

770
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:33,658
It's okay. Yes, yes.

771
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:38,575
You're alive! Pussy.

772
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:42,162
No!

773
01:27:46,344 --> 01:27:47,504
No!

774
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:57,014
No!

775
01:27:58,732 --> 01:28:00,438
I'm gonna kill her!

776
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:07,521
No. No!

777
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:12,363
- Give her to me.
- No! No!

778
01:28:12,454 --> 01:28:14,160
- Give me the cat.
- No!

779
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:17,698
- No!
- Your cat's dead.

780
01:28:24,174 --> 01:28:25,289
Go!

781
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:32,541
You're waking up
the whole damn neighborhood.

782
01:30:32,636 --> 01:30:36,003
- Now turn that damn noise down.
- I'm sorry.

783
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:37,962
It's Annabel. We had an argument,

784
01:30:38,058 --> 01:30:41,425
and she locked herself
upstairs in her room.

785
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:45,728
I don't know about any argument.
We just want to sleep.

786
01:30:45,815 --> 01:30:48,397
Of course. I'm sorry. I'll tell her.

787
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:53,611
- Hey, what was that?
- Annabel, I think.

788
01:30:54,532 --> 01:30:57,695
Didn't you say that your wife
was up in her room?

789
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:01,448
What's all this?

790
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:05,577
It looks like blood.

791
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:15,255
Oh, I... I cut my foot coming down...
Coming down the stairs.

792
01:31:15,345 --> 01:31:18,803
I didn't... didn't realize it. Oh. Oh.

793
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:21,715
- I better take care of it. Good night.
- Yeah.

794
01:31:22,268 --> 01:31:25,055
And, uh, don't forget
about the music. I mean...

795
01:31:25,146 --> 01:31:26,431
- Yes.
- Okay.

796
01:31:31,987 --> 01:31:34,103
"Life here has become ugly.

797
01:31:34,656 --> 01:31:35,771
I'm leaving you.

798
01:31:36,825 --> 01:31:40,158
I know enough of what has happened
fo never want to see you again.

799
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:43,027
Do not look for me.”

800
01:31:57,303 --> 01:32:00,716
You wanted fo leave me,
but now we're together forever.

801
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:26,158
Hi. I'm here for my lesson.

802
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:28,331
Not today. We're leaving.

803
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:31,997
Leaving? But Annabel told me
I had a lesson...

804
01:32:32,088 --> 01:32:35,125
She must have made a mistake.
We're going on a vacation.

805
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:36,752
- Well, can...
- 9547? Mr. Usher?

806
01:32:36,843 --> 01:32:39,550
- Come on in.
- Well, can I at least say good-bye?

807
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:42,094
She's sleeping. Just put it right there.

808
01:32:42,182 --> 01:32:44,298
Make sure to be quiet.
Somebody's sleeping.

809
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:47,308
Quiet. Somebody's sleeping.

810
01:33:33,399 --> 01:33:36,812
Sorry about last night. Annabel and me...

811
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:41,237
Oh, for me? Oh, how sweet.

812
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:45,943
You know how it is.
We had an argument. Pfft.

813
01:33:46,037 --> 01:33:48,619
- Oh, nothing serious, I hope.
- No.

814
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:52,144
As a matter of fact, we're going away
for a week to be alone together.

815
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:57,128
Oh, that'll be so nice. Annabel needs it.
She's been kind of gloomy

816
01:33:57,215 --> 01:33:59,693
- ever since her cat disappeared.
- So we'll see you next week.

817
01:33:59,717 --> 01:34:01,048
Say good-bye to Mr. pym for me.

818
01:34:01,136 --> 01:34:03,969
Oh, he'll be right back.
You can catch him before we go out.

819
01:34:04,848 --> 01:34:05,848
You're going out?

820
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:09,136
My hubby's taking me
to the movies tonight.

821
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:10,842
We love the movies.

822
01:35:22,342 --> 01:35:23,502
Mr. pym.

823
01:35:23,593 --> 01:35:25,321
- Mrs. pym. See you next week.
- Oh, look.

824
01:35:25,345 --> 01:35:27,961
Ah!

825
01:35:29,933 --> 01:35:33,471
- The bastard!
- Come on. He's just trying to be friendly.

826
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:35,973
Imagine taking a vacation in this weather.

827
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:41,774
They saw us leaving fogether.
Two withesses.

828
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:44,735
Nobody will think of looking
for you in the house.

829
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:11,672
Mister. Your drink.

830
01:36:12,517 --> 01:36:13,757
Thanks.

831
01:36:14,686 --> 01:36:17,769
- How's your wife feeling?
- Much better, thanks.

832
01:36:18,523 --> 01:36:19,933
In fact, she's leaving today.

833
01:36:20,024 --> 01:36:22,686
Nothing worse than getting sick
on your vacation, huh?

834
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:24,608
- Will you be eating here?
- Yes.

835
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:26,978
After I drop her off at the station.

836
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:07,147
Hello.

837
01:37:27,467 --> 01:37:28,502
Hello.

838
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:34,254
Hello!

839
01:38:48,172 --> 01:38:50,538
Hey, sorry. It's just me. It's Christian.

840
01:38:50,633 --> 01:38:53,841
- What are you doing here?
- I left my violin.

841
01:38:53,928 --> 01:38:56,340
I've been calling all week,
but nobody answered.

842
01:38:56,431 --> 01:38:59,031
- And I need to practice, so I...
- Well, you got it. Now get out.

843
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:03,093
- All right. Where's Annabel?
- She's left.

844
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:06,125
She's gone on tour with an orchestra.

845
01:39:06,149 --> 01:39:08,515
She'll be gone for a while.
Two, three weeks.

846
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:10,520
- You have her address?
- No.

847
01:39:13,573 --> 01:39:15,609
She... she's traveling a lot.

848
01:39:18,077 --> 01:39:20,693
- Hello.
- Hi. Can I speak fo Annabel?

849
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:22,653
- Hmm?
- She gave me this number.

850
01:39:22,748 --> 01:39:23,908
Is she there?

851
01:39:25,168 --> 01:39:26,408
No, she's left.

852
01:39:26,502 --> 01:39:30,791
- I don't understand.
- Who... who is this? Did you call before?

853
01:39:31,549 --> 01:39:33,790
- What do you want?
- What do you mean, she's left?

854
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:37,878
I've been waiting for her in New York
for a week. I don't mean to pry, but...

855
01:39:37,972 --> 01:39:39,972
What do you mean
you're waiting for her?

856
01:39:40,808 --> 01:39:42,639
Who are you, her boyfriend or something?

857
01:39:44,103 --> 01:39:46,594
Listen, asshole. You better listen to me.

858
01:39:46,689 --> 01:39:50,602
Don't you ever
call this house again. Ever!

859
01:39:50,943 --> 01:39:51,978
You hear me?

860
01:39:54,363 --> 01:39:56,979
That's strange. “What?

861
01:39:57,074 --> 01:40:00,074
Well, you think if she'd have gone
on tour, she would have taken her violin.

862
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:04,161
She has two.

863
01:40:05,416 --> 01:40:07,936
Look, I heard what you were saying
to that guy on the telephone.

864
01:40:08,586 --> 01:40:10,292
- I mean, if...
- What do you want?

865
01:40:10,379 --> 01:40:12,939
You don't know anything,
so why don't you mind your own business.

866
01:40:16,344 --> 01:40:17,834
And don't come back.

867
01:40:20,515 --> 01:40:22,756
Oh, Mr. Usher.

868
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:24,431
- You're back.
- Just me.

869
01:40:24,519 --> 01:40:26,225
Yeah, Annabel went on tour,

870
01:40:26,312 --> 01:40:28,974
only she didn't take her violin
and she never got there.

871
01:40:29,941 --> 01:40:33,058
Well, uh, will she be away long?

872
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:36,235
Two or three months.
If they want her longer, who knows.

873
01:40:36,322 --> 01:40:38,483
Don't listen to this guy.
He's a damned liar.

874
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:43,113
Well, I'll miss her.
Your wife and I love to talk together.

875
01:40:43,204 --> 01:40:45,820
- You mean Annabel?
- Yes.

876
01:40:46,832 --> 01:40:51,121
- She's not my wife.
- Oh? I-I thought...

877
01:40:51,212 --> 01:40:53,532
We've lived together for four years,
but we're not married.

878
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:55,090
Oh.

879
01:40:55,174 --> 01:40:58,917
Well, uh, come on, Gloria. Excuse us.

880
01:40:59,011 --> 01:41:00,217
Don't worry about it.

881
01:41:03,516 --> 01:41:04,881
And you, stay away.

882
01:41:05,977 --> 01:41:07,217
You're lying, man.

883
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:13,685
You're lying!

884
01:41:15,611 --> 01:41:16,611
He's lying!

885
01:41:18,489 --> 01:41:19,854
He knows where she is.

886
01:42:23,346 --> 01:42:25,302
I told you not to call back.

887
01:43:14,271 --> 01:43:16,711
Must have gotten inside
while I was building the wall.

888
01:43:57,857 --> 01:44:00,394
Mr. Usher. Hi.

889
01:44:01,277 --> 01:44:02,983
My name's father hammer.
I'm your neighbor.

890
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:04,070
Hello.

891
01:44:06,157 --> 01:44:08,739
- It's leaking.
- Yeah, it's blood.

892
01:44:08,826 --> 01:44:10,782
- Oh.
- It's a rat.

893
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:14,453
A big rat.
“Where did it come from?

894
01:44:15,541 --> 01:44:17,702
It got into my house,
and I had to kill it.

895
01:44:18,502 --> 01:44:22,370
Huge. I stabbed it a few times,
but, uh, it wouldn't die.

896
01:44:22,465 --> 01:44:24,205
So I had to keep on stabbing it.

897
01:44:25,593 --> 01:44:27,800
- You wanna take a look?
- No. Uh, thanks.

898
01:44:27,887 --> 01:44:30,424
Li... I can't stand rats.

899
01:44:30,514 --> 01:44:31,879
I understand.

900
01:45:17,144 --> 01:45:18,259
"Murder."

901
01:45:22,525 --> 01:45:23,935
Let him talk.

902
01:45:40,793 --> 01:45:43,034
- Surprised?
- Not really.

903
01:45:43,128 --> 01:45:46,871
Not really?

904
01:45:46,966 --> 01:45:49,833
False accusations are like the wind.

905
01:45:51,595 --> 01:45:56,134
- At least I'm lucky they sent you.
- Yeah. Well, we'll see how lucky you are.

906
01:45:56,225 --> 01:45:59,183
You know, rod, they mentioned your name
down at the precinct, and I said,

907
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:03,730
"I know that guy. He's an artiste."

908
01:46:03,816 --> 01:46:06,057
Let's not stand on ceremony. Have a seat.

909
01:46:06,151 --> 01:46:10,645
Oh, we like standing.
But we prefer walking. Check it out.

910
01:46:15,286 --> 01:46:19,245
I haven't had breakfast yet,
and I've got a lot of errands to run.

911
01:46:19,331 --> 01:46:21,617
Hmm. Well, we won't be long.

912
01:46:27,298 --> 01:46:28,959
- Phone's unplugged.
- Oh.

913
01:46:30,634 --> 01:46:34,047
There have been a lot
of kook calls since the book came out.

914
01:46:34,138 --> 01:46:36,299
Amateur photographers.

915
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:39,257
- God bless you.
- Lls there a cat in here?

916
01:46:41,353 --> 01:46:45,346
- There was one, but now it's gone.
- And what happened to it?

917
01:46:46,317 --> 01:46:48,933
Don't tell me you're here
to search for a lost cat.

918
01:46:49,028 --> 01:46:52,395
I asked you something.

919
01:46:52,489 --> 01:46:57,028
It was here for a few days,
and then it disappeared!

920
01:46:57,119 --> 01:47:01,283
Disappeared, huh?
Look, speaking of disappearance, uh, rod,

921
01:47:01,373 --> 01:47:02,829
what happened to your wife?

922
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:06,040
She's not my wife.

923
01:47:07,463 --> 01:47:11,627
Oh, right, right.
What was her name? Uh, Annabel.

924
01:47:12,343 --> 01:47:15,050
What do you mean "was"?
It's still her name.

925
01:47:15,971 --> 01:47:18,053
Well, past tense.

926
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:19,550
It's a bad habit.

927
01:47:20,225 --> 01:47:23,308
It seems whenever you and I meet,
there's always a body around.

928
01:47:41,372 --> 01:47:44,034
Okay, tell us where she is,
we'll have breakfast delivered.

929
01:47:44,124 --> 01:47:46,911
I don't know! If I knew, I'd tell you.

930
01:47:52,383 --> 01:47:53,748
She left me.

931
01:47:55,761 --> 01:47:58,252
We spent a couple of days up at a lake.

932
01:47:58,347 --> 01:48:00,178
We couldn't patch things up.

933
01:48:01,642 --> 01:48:05,601
- She has a sister who lives in...
- No, her sister hasn't heard from her.

934
01:48:06,981 --> 01:48:08,767
No wonder. They don't like each other.

935
01:48:18,242 --> 01:48:19,982
Excuse me.

936
01:48:20,077 --> 01:48:23,911
That cat of yours must have
left a lot of fur behind, huh?

937
01:48:26,041 --> 01:48:28,453
Say, this is the cat, isn't it, rod?

938
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:36,340
You know, rod, they say that you... you
tortured this cat to get these pictures.

939
01:48:37,302 --> 01:48:38,963
Now you wouldn't do that, would you?

940
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:41,295
Say it isn't so, rod.

941
01:48:42,099 --> 01:48:43,259
It isn't so.

942
01:48:44,059 --> 01:48:45,059
Good.

943
01:48:45,644 --> 01:48:48,932
My kid has a couple
of little kittens. Loves 'em.

944
01:48:49,648 --> 01:48:52,139
- Plays with 'em all the time.
- Great, legrand!

945
01:48:52,234 --> 01:48:54,194
Have rod take care of 'em
when you go on vacation.

946
01:49:00,492 --> 01:49:02,653
- Hello.
- This is Joseph.

947
01:49:02,745 --> 01:49:04,406
I called yesterday from New York.

948
01:49:06,081 --> 01:49:07,684
You wish to speak with Mr. Usher.

949
01:49:07,708 --> 01:49:10,120
Sorry, Mr. Usher is not at home.

950
01:49:11,879 --> 01:49:13,523
Pain in the ass
won't leave me alone.

951
01:49:13,547 --> 01:49:15,253
- Ah.
- Wants some of my pictures.

952
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:16,660
I have to get an unlisted number.

953
01:49:16,717 --> 01:49:21,677
Ah. So Annabel and the cat took off, huh?
Didn't say where they were going, though.

954
01:49:21,764 --> 01:49:24,597
Cats don't talk. But Annabel left a note.

955
01:49:25,142 --> 01:49:26,632
It's around here somewhere.

956
01:49:39,239 --> 01:49:41,696
Real love letter.

957
01:49:41,784 --> 01:49:45,151
Why'd you tell the neighbors
that she was going on an orchestra tour?

958
01:49:45,245 --> 01:49:48,863
I don't have to tell
those busybodies my business.

959
01:49:48,957 --> 01:49:52,666
True. You got any letters of hers?

960
01:49:52,753 --> 01:49:55,244
- This is her picture, isn't it?
- Yes.

961
01:49:55,339 --> 01:49:57,751
- Do you mind if we take it?
- No.

962
01:50:03,889 --> 01:50:06,972
Oh, and you could give me
the book as a present, huh?

963
01:50:08,143 --> 01:50:09,143
Sure.

964
01:50:10,604 --> 01:50:13,266
- Thanks, rod.
- You almost coauthored it with me.

965
01:50:15,317 --> 01:50:19,606
Oh, one more thing. Um, where'd you
and Annabel go on this vacation of yours?

966
01:50:19,696 --> 01:50:22,403
To lake Arthur.
I have a dual house on the shore there.

967
01:50:22,491 --> 01:50:26,109
Uh-huh. Okay, rod, thank you. Let's go.

968
01:50:35,629 --> 01:50:38,120
Gentlemen, I'm glad
your suspicions have been allayed.

969
01:50:38,215 --> 01:50:40,080
I wish you a long and happy life.

970
01:50:41,718 --> 01:50:46,087
And what did you expect to find
between these solidly put-together walls?

971
01:50:56,942 --> 01:50:58,682
Open up. It's me again.

972
01:51:04,867 --> 01:51:06,232
You forgot to sign it.

973
01:51:15,294 --> 01:51:16,329
Ah.

974
01:51:21,175 --> 01:51:23,291
That's funny. It was working a minute ago.

975
01:51:28,348 --> 01:51:30,430
I'm sure you got a pen inside.

976
01:51:42,571 --> 01:51:44,778
Hey, rod, I liked what you said before

977
01:51:44,865 --> 01:51:47,106
about me almost coauthoring
the book with you.

978
01:51:47,201 --> 01:51:48,657
Would you sign it like that?

979
01:51:54,208 --> 01:51:55,323
Yeah.

980
01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:01,620
Where's that coming from?

981
01:52:40,379 --> 01:52:42,745
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Hold it.

982
01:52:43,507 --> 01:52:44,792
What do you got?

983
01:52:51,223 --> 01:52:52,258
Boss.

984
01:53:08,699 --> 01:53:11,736
- It's fresh.
- What'd you say, rod?

985
01:53:11,827 --> 01:53:15,445
What'd we think we were gonna find
behind these solidly built walls?

986
01:53:15,539 --> 01:53:17,495
A little guessing game, huh, rod?

987
01:53:18,083 --> 01:53:21,701
- What do you think? Break it down?
- Sure.

988
01:53:22,170 --> 01:53:24,286
I got just the tool.

989
01:53:38,395 --> 01:53:40,431
Well, we found what we were looking for.

990
01:53:56,663 --> 01:53:59,996
Oh, god! The smell!

991
01:54:01,001 --> 01:54:02,161
Keep going.

992
01:54:06,214 --> 01:54:09,752
/t was pregnant.
It had its kittens in there.

993
01:54:13,430 --> 01:54:14,761
Tear the whole thing down!

994
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:21,643
You walled 'em in there!

995
01:54:28,195 --> 01:54:31,813
They're... eating... her.

996
01:55:19,204 --> 01:55:21,695
What's going on here?

997
01:55:21,790 --> 01:55:24,577
What's going on in there?

998
01:55:24,668 --> 01:55:28,627
Open the door! What's going on in there?

999
01:55:29,047 --> 01:55:31,629
- Let us in!
- Open the door!

1000
01:55:33,593 --> 01:55:36,505
What's going on in there? Do you hear us?

1001
01:55:36,596 --> 01:55:39,588
Come on. Open the door! Open the door!

1002
01:55:42,477 --> 01:55:44,934
Let's hurry! Come on. Open it!

1003
01:55:45,021 --> 01:55:47,603
Open the door!
