1
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:14,610
Our bosun's mate.
Been on quite a bender tonight.

2
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,580
Who are those pigs?

3
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:43,222
Their fireboat drill.
They're all from my boat.

4
00:04:07,371 --> 00:04:10,041
Captain.

5
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:21,052
Marten's crew.
They move out at dawn.

6
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:33,356
It's time to find ourselves
a little French quail.

7
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:39,111
Do you know how to flush it out?

8
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:44,617
They're scared. They comfort
themselves in women and schnapps.

9
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:49,789
- What's going on here?
- Ready ... Fire!

10
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:02,134
- Sir.
- My second officer.

11
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,350
This is Lieutenant Werner.
War correspondent.

12
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:16,815
He'll ship out with us, and report
the truth about life on a submarine.

13
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:22,863
- Welcome on board, Lieutenant.
- Good evening.

14
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:32,039
Come and have a drink with us.

15
00:05:32,873 --> 00:05:38,754
- Good evening, Captain.
- Two beers, please.

16
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:59,108
Where's our friend Thomsen?
He should be celebrating his medal.

17
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,073
Have you talked to your wife?

18
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:13,789
No calls to Germany
before 10 o'clock.

19
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:21,171
- Two beers.
- Thanks.

20
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:25,509
Captain.

21
00:06:27,594 --> 00:06:33,392
My report from U96, sir.
All provisions and arms aboard.

22
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:37,688
- Thank you.
- One more thing, Captain.

23
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:46,530
On the way here
some of the crew molested me.

24
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:52,327
It was ... quite outrageous.

25
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:56,790
- They stopped me and ...
- You were initiated?

26
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,629
- Exactly.
- Me, too.

27
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:12,973
May I have your attention?
Silence would be appreciated!

28
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:19,187
I'd like to call on Lt. Thomsen,
our latest hero!

29
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:37,664
Thomsen is from the old guard.
He's always drunk now.

30
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:02,981
Quiet in this whorehouse!

31
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:19,164
To our wonderful ... abstaining ...
womanless Fuhrer, -

32
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:25,837
- who rose gloriously
from an apprentice painter -

33
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:30,967
- to become the world's
greatest battle strategist.

34
00:08:31,134 --> 00:08:34,804
Isn't it true?

35
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:43,855
He's a great naval expert.
Who, in his infinite wisdom ...

36
00:08:52,614 --> 00:08:56,326
How does it go again?

37
00:08:56,493 --> 00:09:02,665
Our great Fuhrer has been showing
their English bed-wetter ...

38
00:09:02,832 --> 00:09:07,462
... the cigar-chomping
asshole Churchill ...

39
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:14,636
... where exactly to go
and stick his stinking cigars.

40
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:57,095
Excuse me.

41
00:09:57,261 --> 00:10:01,808
I'll see you in the morning.
I must phone home.

42
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:21,160
Phillip, the old bunch has gone.

43
00:10:21,327 --> 00:10:29,043
Look at these new heroes.
All wind and smoke. Big mouths.

44
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,463
Yeah, yeah ...

45
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:37,468
Cheeks together.
Balls in hand.

46
00:10:37,635 --> 00:10:42,765
And the belief in our Fuhrer
in their eyes.

47
00:10:42,932 --> 00:10:46,143
They will know in time.

48
00:11:36,485 --> 00:11:40,948
Combat! Conquer! Order!

49
00:11:55,296 --> 00:12:01,886
Come on, Phillip.
Give me a hand. Help me get him up.

50
00:12:09,393 --> 00:12:14,607
I wanted to really ...
screw my brains out tonight, -

51
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:19,361
- but I'm not
in any condition to fuck.

52
00:12:33,751 --> 00:12:38,756
That's Thomsen's boat.
Find anything wrong with our boat?

53
00:12:38,922 --> 00:12:44,178
- The propeller plate was banged.
- I see.

54
00:12:44,344 --> 00:12:51,351
- That explains the whining noise.
- We've got a brand new one.

55
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:27,638
That's our boat.

56
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:36,021
Stand by for inspection! Attention!
Eyes left!

57
00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:48,116
All hands present and accounted for.
The boat is clear for sea, Captain.

58
00:13:48,283 --> 00:13:51,661
Thank you, Number One.

59
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,669
At ease.

60
00:14:16,103 --> 00:14:20,273
Well, men ...

61
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:25,070
- All set?
- All set, sir!

62
00:14:27,948 --> 00:14:33,745
We have a guest on board.
Lt. Werner.

63
00:14:33,912 --> 00:14:40,961
A war correspondent.
He has even brought his camera.

64
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:54,432
He is writing about war heroes.
See you remember your manners.

65
00:14:54,599 --> 00:15:00,897
- Aye-aye, sir!
- Harbour stations, men.

66
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:52,907
Sink them all!

67
00:16:18,516 --> 00:16:18,599
Get those crates out of here!
This isn't a vegetable garden.

68
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:23,646
Get those crates out of here!
This isn't a vegetable garden.

69
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:27,817
Fish store, where we maintain
and store the torpedoes.

70
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:32,321
- You're going to be in the papers!
- Thank you, men.

71
00:16:32,488 --> 00:16:37,702
Follow me. Here we have the can.
Just one for 50 men.

72
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:43,833
The other one's full of provisions.
You can't eat shit. Logical, no?

73
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,883
Here's the Chief Petty Officer's
quarters. My home away from home.

74
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:57,138
- I've brought plenty of books.
- You have it really cosy here.

75
00:16:57,305 --> 00:17:02,477
- Where are you, Lieutenant?
- I hope you don't get sea sick.

76
00:17:02,643 --> 00:17:08,941
Here's the radio and the hydrophone.
The eyes and ears of the boat.

77
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:15,031
Here's the control room.
The boat's command post.

78
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,704
Through here, Lieutenant.

79
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:26,000
Wake up, you've got company.

80
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:29,629
Good morning, Lieutenant.

81
00:17:29,795 --> 00:17:34,050
The petty officers' bunk
sleeps 12 men.

82
00:17:34,216 --> 00:17:37,970
Two to a bunk.
One sleeps while one is on duty.

83
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:43,392
One man comes off watch and
climbs into the other man's stink.

84
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:49,065
You've got a bunk to yourself
since you're a guest on board.

85
00:17:49,231 --> 00:17:53,694
- Here.
- This is your escape gear.

86
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:59,742
- You can use it in the shower.
- The mask helps out with the stink.

87
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:03,788
Of Frenssen's feet!

88
00:18:03,954 --> 00:18:07,500
Come on.

89
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:15,174
This is our galley.
And here's Johann, our phantom.

90
00:18:18,469 --> 00:18:22,556
Johann, everything in order?

91
00:18:23,182 --> 00:18:28,979
- Permission to come up?
- Yes, Lieutenant.

92
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:53,504
It's better to take photos
on our return from the mission.

93
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:57,299
What do you mean?

94
00:18:57,466 --> 00:19:01,428
They'll have grown beards by then.

95
00:19:11,021 --> 00:19:16,151
The British will be ashamed
to see these shaven faces.

96
00:19:16,318 --> 00:19:22,699
Pale-faced kids.
Innocents dragged from mama's skirt.

97
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:31,083
Sailing with them
makes you feel so old.

98
00:19:33,502 --> 00:19:38,966
It's like a children's crusade.

99
00:19:46,932 --> 00:19:50,936
- Permission to pass, sir.
- Carry on.

100
00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:55,065
- Bon appetit.
- Thank you.

101
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:23,885
- From Mexico, aren't you?
- Yes. South of Mexico City.

102
00:20:24,052 --> 00:20:30,892
- Good there?
- Very nice. Good climate.

103
00:20:43,363 --> 00:20:49,953
- Quite a way.
- As a German, I had to come.

104
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:58,044
- Did you work there?
- On my step-parents' plantation.

105
00:20:59,796 --> 00:21:04,426
- You're the boss's son?
- You could say so.

106
00:21:05,177 --> 00:21:11,183
- Stand by, first watch.
- Excuse me.

107
00:21:12,976 --> 00:21:16,980
Can I get by?

108
00:21:24,154 --> 00:21:28,992
Permission to go on watch, Captain.

109
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:38,001
A new breed, our Mexican recruit.

110
00:21:40,503 --> 00:21:46,092
A young machine.
He follows orders without question.

111
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:51,973
He's so uptight he could
crack nuts with his butt cheeks.

112
00:22:01,024 --> 00:22:08,364
- Permission to come up?
- Yes, Lieutenant.

113
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:11,326
Stand by main vents.

114
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:22,337
- Shut out main engines!
- All hands forward!

115
00:22:22,504 --> 00:22:29,427
All hands forward!
Come on, move it.

116
00:22:29,594 --> 00:22:34,974
Come on, move! Move! Faster!

117
00:22:35,141 --> 00:22:38,311
Get a move on, you guys!

118
00:22:39,354 --> 00:22:45,443
It's an alarm, not a blasted cruise!
Get into diving positions!

119
00:23:02,752 --> 00:23:06,214
Blow negative tank.

120
00:23:08,132 --> 00:23:12,303
Stern planes ease to 10 degrees.

121
00:23:22,605 --> 00:23:28,945
Not bad. Practice makes perfect.
It keeps you from getting rusty.

122
00:23:29,112 --> 00:23:31,823
A practice drill.

123
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:39,247
- Level off, Chief.
- Bow up 15. Stern up 10.

124
00:23:39,413 --> 00:23:42,750
Planes on zero.

125
00:23:44,961 --> 00:23:49,173
- Levelled off, sir.
- Shut all main vents.

126
00:23:50,383 --> 00:23:57,098
- Main vents shut.
- Dive. Let's see how she does.

127
00:23:58,849 --> 00:24:01,769
Bow planes down 15. Stern up 10.

128
00:24:10,653 --> 00:24:18,285
The boat is rated to 90 metres,
but of course we could go deeper.

129
00:24:28,754 --> 00:24:34,176
There's a limit somewhere.
We can only take so much pressure -

130
00:24:34,343 --> 00:24:39,765
- before the boat will be crushed.

131
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:56,740
Check all valves.

132
00:25:00,077 --> 00:25:03,539
Check all valves.

133
00:25:03,706 --> 00:25:07,501
- The pressure.
- Yeah, sure.

134
00:25:15,134 --> 00:25:18,178
Deeper.

135
00:25:19,471 --> 00:25:22,975
140 metres.

136
00:25:28,147 --> 00:25:33,485
- She must take this depth.
- 150.

137
00:25:38,073 --> 00:25:41,410
160 metres.

138
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:53,464
- That'll do for now. Surface.
- Bow up 10. Stern up 5.

139
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,925
Our journalist is sweating.

140
00:26:37,758 --> 00:26:41,053
Your girl?

141
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:47,851
French girl?

142
00:26:54,191 --> 00:27:00,947
Do you know the flower shop
beside Cafe A L'Ami Pierrot?

143
00:27:01,114 --> 00:27:05,160
- A L'Ami Pierrot.
- Sure, I know it.

144
00:27:05,327 --> 00:27:09,539
The two pretty salesgirls.
Jeannette and ...

145
00:27:09,706 --> 00:27:12,876
Francoise.

146
00:27:14,961 --> 00:27:19,007
Nobody knows ... but we're engaged.

147
00:27:19,174 --> 00:27:22,260
Unofficially.

148
00:27:28,183 --> 00:27:31,436
Can I see?

149
00:27:35,148 --> 00:27:38,109
Very pretty. Really.

150
00:27:43,532 --> 00:27:46,826
What's wrong?

151
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,666
She's pregnant.

152
00:27:55,126 --> 00:28:00,215
Don't you know what that means?

153
00:28:00,382 --> 00:28:04,636
If the resistance finds out?
A German baby.

154
00:28:04,803 --> 00:28:11,810
I told her,
but she wants to have it.

155
00:28:13,853 --> 00:28:19,901
- She wants a baby.
- You've got problems, friend.

156
00:29:08,408 --> 00:29:14,831
Our masters spend all their time
finding Churchill new nicknames.

157
00:29:14,998 --> 00:29:17,834
What's the latest?

158
00:29:20,962 --> 00:29:24,382
Drunken pig.

159
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:27,593
Fat boy.

160
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,888
Paralytic.

161
00:29:31,055 --> 00:29:36,269
For a drunken paralytic
he's putting up a damn good fight.

162
00:29:36,436 --> 00:29:42,275
We'll cut the swine to shreds.
That is my firm belief.

163
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:53,202
Listen, smart guy. Mr. Churchill
is a long way from shreds.

164
00:29:55,288 --> 00:29:59,667
I'd like to know how many
of his ships are getting through -

165
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:04,255
- while we sit on our behinds
waiting for orders.

166
00:30:04,422 --> 00:30:08,509
Our patrol planes.
Where are they, Herr Goring?

167
00:30:08,676 --> 00:30:15,850
The British have plenty of them.
Talking big is all he's good for.

168
00:30:20,646 --> 00:30:25,026
Big heroes.
Nothing but hot air ... all of them.

169
00:30:32,617 --> 00:30:40,416
Put that one down. It'll make
exciting reading in your epic.

170
00:30:43,586 --> 00:30:48,090
The Propaganda Ministry
will love it.

171
00:30:48,257 --> 00:30:51,802
Music we need.

172
00:30:51,969 --> 00:30:57,600
Do you think our Hitler Youth leader
might put a record on for us?

173
00:30:59,226 --> 00:31:04,607
The "Tipperary" song
if you have no objections.

174
00:31:12,823 --> 00:31:19,830
- That stuff makes me puke.
- Now we're in the Royal Navy.

175
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:34,345
A record won't make you
into the king of England.

176
00:31:49,485 --> 00:31:53,739
- Shut the door, you lazy pig!
- Stupid jerk!

177
00:31:55,157 --> 00:32:01,372
They should use him as a doorstop,
his rear end's big enough.

178
00:32:01,538 --> 00:32:08,837
One day he'll stick it in the can
and he'll never get it out again.

179
00:32:12,257 --> 00:32:17,721
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Lieutenant.

180
00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:23,394
- It stinks in here.
- Sweaty feet and hair grease.

181
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:28,148
Pilgrim's specialty.

182
00:32:33,946 --> 00:32:40,244
Smells just like old socks ...
these rotten eggs.

183
00:32:41,495 --> 00:32:48,961
- Baby poo-poo.
- Pilgrim needs a chicken house.

184
00:32:49,128 --> 00:32:53,132
Right. Ducks in the bilge.
Sweet little ducklings.

185
00:32:53,298 --> 00:32:58,595
We could fatten them up
with jam from your filthy feet.

186
00:32:58,762 --> 00:33:06,562
They'd have good fun
feeding on Frenssen's toe jam.

187
00:33:38,135 --> 00:33:42,431
Aid to cleanliness, four letters?

188
00:33:44,224 --> 00:33:47,894
Bath.

189
00:33:49,521 --> 00:33:52,524
Thank you.

190
00:33:57,988 --> 00:34:02,534
A desert animal with two humps?

191
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:08,748
- Camel.
- Perfect.

192
00:34:18,383 --> 00:34:24,347
Intellectual starvation I would say.

193
00:34:30,437 --> 00:34:35,984
It's completed, sir. Signal decoded.

194
00:34:43,825 --> 00:34:47,412
One moment.

195
00:35:14,898 --> 00:35:22,739
It could just about do it.
Five, six, seven ...

196
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:28,536
- Eight.
- New course, sir?

197
00:35:33,124 --> 00:35:36,044
One minute.

198
00:35:39,797 --> 00:35:43,676
What's the signal position, sir?

199
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:52,685
"Convoy square at AK 22,46."

200
00:35:52,852 --> 00:35:58,733
"Mean course: 60 degrees.
Speed: 8 knots. U-boat 37."

201
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:03,780
U-boat 37. That's Marten's boat
moving in to attack.

202
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:14,540
- Too far away. We'd never make it.
- Bad luck.

203
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:20,963
Damn it!
When do we get some orders?

204
00:36:28,262 --> 00:36:35,061
Come on, pull it out!
Slap more grease on it!

205
00:36:35,228 --> 00:36:40,358
- For your journal?
- Yes, wonderful stuff.

206
00:36:40,525 --> 00:36:43,653
You there, this way a moment.

207
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:49,826
It's nicely greased with vaseline.
We're ready to ram it in!

208
00:36:49,992 --> 00:36:55,498
Can you just look this way?
Yes, good.

209
00:36:57,917 --> 00:37:03,923
Not quite so fast. This way. Great!

210
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:10,137
Stay here in the foreground.
Let's have some with a different ...

211
00:37:22,233 --> 00:37:25,361
Who did that?

212
00:37:27,697 --> 00:37:30,408
Who did that?

213
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:23,294
Tell me now ...
Have you got any hairs up your nose?

214
00:38:24,795 --> 00:38:29,425
- Why?
- I've got some up mine.

215
00:38:29,592 --> 00:38:33,721
Maybe we could knit them together.

216
00:38:41,103 --> 00:38:47,276
"2nd November, 1941.
Dear Francoise ..."

217
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:06,211
"20th day at sea."

218
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:10,966
- Alarm!
- Alarm!

219
00:39:12,468 --> 00:39:17,598
- Hatch secured!
- All main vents open!

220
00:39:17,765 --> 00:39:22,895
- Shadow off the starboard beam.
- Take her down 30 metres.

221
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:28,609
Bring her up easy.
Planes on zero.

222
00:39:28,775 --> 00:39:34,865
- Anything on the starboard beam?
- Propeller sounds.

223
00:39:43,624 --> 00:39:46,710
1 10 degrees.

224
00:39:51,048 --> 00:39:54,843
Way aft of us.

225
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:07,105
Contact growing fainter.

226
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:18,367
Fading fast, sir.

227
00:40:23,747 --> 00:40:32,130
Right ... we'd better stay down now.
Steer 120.

228
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:42,808
A lone ship traveling fast.
We have no chance in this light.

229
00:41:05,705 --> 00:41:11,211
"It's more than superficial to take
care in personal appearance."

230
00:41:11,378 --> 00:41:16,967
"It denotes that the inner man
is wholesome and upstanding."

231
00:41:17,133 --> 00:41:24,349
"An officer should be unpretentious
in his dress and deportment."

232
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:29,562
"In the old days young officers
were treated indulgently in this."

233
00:41:29,729 --> 00:41:35,318
"Knowing they risked their lives,
their superiors ..."

234
00:41:35,485 --> 00:41:38,488
It's comfortable here.

235
00:41:38,655 --> 00:41:42,659
No mail. No telephone.

236
00:41:42,826 --> 00:41:49,290
A well-ventilated boat.
Solid wood panelling.

237
00:41:52,127 --> 00:41:57,590
Free food, too.
We're in clover here.

238
00:41:57,757 --> 00:42:01,970
Like fresh horse droppings.

239
00:42:02,137 --> 00:42:08,476
They're rolling in clover, too.
No need to work.

240
00:42:08,643 --> 00:42:12,856
They're even allowed to smoke.

241
00:42:34,294 --> 00:42:38,840
U-boat special cocktail.
Want some?

242
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,729
Stop that!

243
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:16,794
Our recent triumphs.

244
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:21,007
"Dived to evade enemy aircraft."

245
00:43:21,174 --> 00:43:27,513
"Dived to avoid destroyer.
Depth charged."

246
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:37,440
The British
have stopped making mistakes.

247
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:49,368
Cut off extra supply of fuel
to the engines!

248
00:43:52,747 --> 00:43:58,961
Torpedo rooms ...
check the gyro-angles.

249
00:44:05,718 --> 00:44:12,808
- Watch out!
- Check periscope alignment.

250
00:44:12,975 --> 00:44:18,814
- What's going on?
- Here we go, girls.

251
00:44:18,981 --> 00:44:24,487
U-32 has spotted a British convoy.
We should be there in 10 hours.

252
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:37,541
U-32 is operating against a convoy.
We are joining in the hunt.

253
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:42,338
Contact expected
any time after 18:00 hours.

254
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:46,675
These beauties
are ready for blast off.

255
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:52,306
Over 30 freighters.

256
00:44:52,473 --> 00:44:57,895
Berthold is waiting for us to
arrive. He's following the convoy.

257
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:05,986
For me it's the best thrill
with U-boats and sailing ships.

258
00:45:06,153 --> 00:45:09,406
Skimming across the sea.

259
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:17,081
I've sailed on a schooner.
Roomy. Holds as big as churches.

260
00:45:24,213 --> 00:45:29,635
- That's a fine way to waste fuel.
- Lunatic!

261
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:39,311
Damn this weather!

262
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:50,072
We could pass the British completely
without seeing them.

263
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:57,621
We should be within range.
Why doesn't Berthold signal us?

264
00:45:59,081 --> 00:46:04,128
Why haven't we heard from H.Q.?

265
00:46:06,004 --> 00:46:10,968
Visibility is nil, sir.
It's useless!

266
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:20,352
Prepare to dive!

267
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:26,858
Clear the bridge now!

268
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:37,160
Diving positions.
Stand by main vents.

269
00:47:06,273 --> 00:47:06,314
- Take her down 30 metres.
- Bow planes up 10. Stern down 5.

270
00:47:06,314 --> 00:47:12,737
- Take her down 30 metres.
- Bow planes up 10. Stern down 5.

271
00:47:12,904 --> 00:47:19,202
Bow planes zero. Stern zero.

272
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:23,874
What's up? Why are we diving?

273
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,877
A hydrophone check.

274
00:47:27,043 --> 00:47:32,048
In bad weather you can hear more
than you can see on the surface.

275
00:47:32,215 --> 00:47:37,971
Stern planes up 5.
Easy. Both planes zero.

276
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:14,632
Can't you make a contact?

277
00:48:25,518 --> 00:48:29,147
Nothing?

278
00:49:16,945 --> 00:49:20,740
Captain, come here.

279
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:27,622
Contact bearing 060. Quite faint.

280
00:49:42,428 --> 00:49:46,015
Depth charges.

281
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,687
They are blasting someone.

282
00:49:57,193 --> 00:50:01,489
What's the bearing from us now.

283
00:50:05,117 --> 00:50:09,914
Moving right. 045 degrees.

284
00:50:10,081 --> 00:50:13,918
Moving away from us.

285
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:25,388
- Surface. Steer 330.
- All ahead two-thirds.

286
00:50:25,554 --> 00:50:31,602
Note this in our log book. Despite
bad weather, commencing operation.

287
00:51:03,426 --> 00:51:09,306
Damn this stinking weather!
How does it look?

288
00:51:12,143 --> 00:51:20,442
- The enemy should be here.
- Freighter on the starboard bow.

289
00:51:25,698 --> 00:51:31,996
- Over there! 040 and closing.
- Damn it!

290
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:44,800
That's no freighter.
Oh no! A destroyer!

291
00:51:45,467 --> 00:51:50,598
It's coming straight at us.
Clear the bridge.

292
00:51:56,312 --> 00:51:59,773
Take her down!

293
00:52:03,944 --> 00:52:06,363
Diving stations.

294
00:52:08,741 --> 00:52:15,289
- Come to periscope depth.
- All planes up 10.

295
00:52:27,968 --> 00:52:31,889
Steady at 2 metres.

296
00:52:35,893 --> 00:52:38,854
Both planes zero.

297
00:52:44,234 --> 00:52:48,697
Stern down 5.

298
00:52:49,031 --> 00:52:52,951
Come up.

299
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:17,893
- Stand by battle stations.
- Stand by battle stations.

300
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:22,189
- Stand by battle stations.
- Out of the way, damn it!

301
00:53:22,356 --> 00:53:25,651
Gangway!

302
00:53:27,319 --> 00:53:31,031
Faster! Faster!

303
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:42,000
Keep her level, Chief.

304
00:53:50,008 --> 00:53:56,848
- Flood tubes one to four.
- Flood tubes one to four.

305
00:53:57,724 --> 00:54:03,980
He wants to attack the destroyer.
Crazy in this weather.

306
00:54:05,982 --> 00:54:11,821
- Watch your depth, Chief.
- Bow planes up 2. Stern down 2.

307
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,787
Come on.

308
00:54:18,954 --> 00:54:25,168
Both planes come to zero.
13.5 metres.

309
00:54:26,962 --> 00:54:30,924
Open bow caps now.

310
00:54:43,478 --> 00:54:51,111
Enemy's speed: 10.
Range: 6,000.

311
00:54:51,277 --> 00:54:54,489
Depth: 2 metres.

312
00:54:54,656 --> 00:55:01,204
Torpedo speed: 40.
Spread torpedoes one and three.

313
00:55:01,371 --> 00:55:04,749
Spread shots one and three.

314
00:55:05,542 --> 00:55:09,838
Tubes one through four are ready.

315
00:55:32,652 --> 00:55:37,907
Damn it! What happened to them?

316
00:55:53,631 --> 00:55:56,301
Close bow caps! Dive!

317
00:56:04,434 --> 00:56:09,397
Depth charges dropped.

318
00:56:20,992 --> 00:56:26,956
- Get some fuses, quick!
- Check all valves and closures.

319
00:56:53,316 --> 00:56:56,944
No serious damage.

320
00:57:00,156 --> 00:57:04,368
They must've spotted our periscope.

321
00:57:04,535 --> 00:57:10,249
- Control room all secure.
- lncredible in this sea.

322
00:57:37,777 --> 00:57:44,325
- Is it getting louder?
- It seems constant. Ahead of us.

323
00:57:48,454 --> 00:57:51,373
280.

324
00:58:00,007 --> 00:58:06,305
280 minus 35 ...

325
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:19,652
- It's pulling further ahead. 295.
- Left full rudder.

326
00:58:22,446 --> 00:58:28,327
- Rudder is left full.
- Steer due north.

327
00:58:28,494 --> 00:58:32,665
- Deeper, Chief.
- Bow planes down 15. Stern up 10.

328
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:39,755
- Pump 200 litres forward.
- Steering due north, sir.

329
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:48,806
- 200 litres forward.
- Main motors ahead one-third.

330
00:58:53,977 --> 00:58:57,564
Now it gets psychological, friends.

331
00:59:56,915 --> 01:00:01,670
Easy, men.
There's more to come yet.

332
01:00:15,016 --> 01:00:19,187
Kill unnecessary lights.

333
01:00:24,443 --> 01:00:30,157
- Silent speed.
- Both main engines at 50 rpm.

334
01:00:30,323 --> 01:00:33,952
Both engines indicate 50 rpm.

335
01:00:47,632 --> 01:00:54,431
Contact coming closer.
Starboard bow. Closing fast.

336
01:00:54,598 --> 01:00:59,185
Main engines full ahead.
Right full rudder.

337
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:05,692
Both main engines ahead full.

338
01:01:23,626 --> 01:01:28,006
They're coming straight for us.

339
01:01:36,806 --> 01:01:43,313
- He knows what he's doing. Deeper.
- Bow down 20. Stern up 5.

340
01:02:16,763 --> 01:02:22,685
- Destroyer almost above us.
- Deeper, Chief. Quick.

341
01:02:29,692 --> 01:02:33,988
DEPTH GAUGE

342
01:02:41,204 --> 01:02:45,583
Don't be afraid.
It's only the pressure.

343
01:02:54,175 --> 01:02:58,721
- Deeper.
- Stern up 15.

344
01:03:21,536 --> 01:03:24,705
150 metres.

345
01:03:27,124 --> 01:03:30,211
Hurry!

346
01:03:31,837 --> 01:03:38,761
- Tighten that flange.
- Bring her up to 150 metres.

347
01:03:38,928 --> 01:03:43,349
Forward up 20. Stern down.10.

348
01:03:43,516 --> 01:03:51,232
Come on, Frenssen, quickly!
Get the damn thing tightened!

349
01:04:11,544 --> 01:04:17,842
Hull valves secured.
Both planes read zero.

350
01:04:20,511 --> 01:04:24,723
Level at 150 metres.

351
01:04:35,776 --> 01:04:41,532
Becoming louder.
She's turned around. 055.

352
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,962
Go on, get it over.

353
01:04:59,633 --> 01:05:03,387
Contact closing fast.

354
01:05:10,936 --> 01:05:17,276
They are above us ...
just above us.

355
01:05:44,845 --> 01:05:48,891
Contact fading to starboard.

356
01:05:58,734 --> 01:06:01,945
22.

357
01:06:08,577 --> 01:06:12,789
- 23.
- They are far away.

358
01:06:21,173 --> 01:06:24,885
Contact receding aft.

359
01:06:31,892 --> 01:06:35,979
I can barely hear it.

360
01:06:53,789 --> 01:06:58,668
- Now?
- It has passed us by.

361
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:13,475
I think that will be all, this time.

362
01:07:17,979 --> 01:07:23,777
- Silent speed.
- Both main engines 50 rpm.

363
01:07:26,279 --> 01:07:35,580
- Both main engines 50 rpm.
- All compartments report damage.

364
01:07:56,726 --> 01:07:59,979
From my private collection.

365
01:08:13,451 --> 01:08:17,580
- How is the engine room?
- Smashed up badly.

366
01:08:17,747 --> 01:08:22,961
- Will you be able to patch her up?
- I've already started.

367
01:08:23,128 --> 01:08:29,300
Make it good. I've got a feeling
we're going to see some action.

368
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:43,982
Nothing?

369
01:08:59,747 --> 01:09:06,045
- We've waited over an hour now.
- I guess we have shaken them off.

370
01:09:06,212 --> 01:09:13,177
Don't be too sure. He could
have stopped and be waiting -

371
01:09:13,344 --> 01:09:21,310
- to surprise us when we surface.
Not dumb, the British.

372
01:09:21,477 --> 01:09:25,857
Stay on silent speed.
When it's dark, we'll surface.

373
01:09:26,024 --> 01:09:29,277
I see better in the dark.

374
01:09:29,444 --> 01:09:32,113
Captain.

375
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:38,244
Thanks.

376
01:09:46,294 --> 01:09:52,467
- What's it like up top?
- It's dark.

377
01:09:54,510 --> 01:10:01,309
- Go up to 30 metres.
- Bow planes up 15. Stern up 5.

378
01:10:01,475 --> 01:10:05,688
90, 80 ...

379
01:10:05,855 --> 01:10:10,568
70, 60 metres.

380
01:10:11,193 --> 01:10:15,197
50. Coming up fast.

381
01:10:15,781 --> 01:10:23,122
- Sound check at 30.
- She's level at 30 metres.

382
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:37,428
Well?

383
01:10:40,890 --> 01:10:44,393
Periscope depth.

384
01:10:48,564 --> 01:10:54,779
Bow up 3.
Stern down five.

385
01:10:58,657 --> 01:11:01,619
Zero.

386
01:11:15,466 --> 01:11:19,386
- Surface.
- All set to blow.

387
01:12:13,273 --> 01:12:17,319
Cut it out! All this damn noise!

388
01:12:23,450 --> 01:12:29,289
- I've got bad news, men.
- What's up now?

389
01:12:30,999 --> 01:12:34,378
Our team is losing.

390
01:12:36,421 --> 01:12:40,133
5-0.

391
01:12:42,427 --> 01:12:46,181
Not a chance
of making the finals now.

392
01:12:46,348 --> 01:12:49,935
It can't be! I don't believe it!

393
01:12:58,652 --> 01:13:02,114
Drop 'em!

394
01:13:23,719 --> 01:13:27,472
You dirty little boy. Crabs!

395
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:34,146
A whole army of them. They'll eat
your winkie down to the bone.

396
01:13:38,066 --> 01:13:41,820
Give him a go with gun powder!

397
01:13:46,825 --> 01:13:50,537
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

398
01:14:14,019 --> 01:14:18,273
This meat needs a shave.

399
01:14:22,193 --> 01:14:27,407
What are those things
crawling about on your eyebrows?

400
01:14:27,574 --> 01:14:32,203
- Pardon?
- You'd better see the medic.

401
01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:36,291
Crabs by the look of them.

402
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:48,219
When the creatures begin to surface,
it's the fifth stage.

403
01:14:58,271 --> 01:15:04,527
- Get it all in the torpedo room.
- You two, give me a hand.

404
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:12,702
Bosun,
do you know where the medic is?

405
01:15:12,869 --> 01:15:16,581
Yeah, in the bow compartment.

406
01:15:19,459 --> 01:15:24,088
- The more the merrier.
- Have the crabs got you, too?

407
01:15:42,231 --> 01:15:49,572
- Lieutenant!
- What?

408
01:15:49,739 --> 01:15:56,287
Take it easy! Calm down!
Have you gone crazy?

409
01:16:01,334 --> 01:16:06,172
Have you heard the latest?
Our Dufte is tying the knot.

410
01:16:07,382 --> 01:16:13,137
- The stupid pig.
- Half the fleet have tried her.

411
01:16:13,304 --> 01:16:17,475
They should stick you in a zoo
with a chimpanzee.

412
01:16:17,642 --> 01:16:24,315
- Here's the pictures of her!
- You dirty, rotten swine!

413
01:16:27,944 --> 01:16:32,949
Don't tell me this hag
lets you sleep with her.

414
01:17:11,404 --> 01:17:18,577
These boats are built to take it.
You should try a sailing ship.

415
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:22,540
You hardly feel a thing down here.

416
01:17:33,259 --> 01:17:36,429
- Captain.
- Compass.

417
01:17:48,315 --> 01:17:52,528
She's heaving to starboard.
I can't keep on course.

418
01:17:53,195 --> 01:17:57,199
No cause for concern.

419
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:06,625
It's pointless, sir.
We're burning up fuel for nothing.

420
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:16,135
Prepare to dive.

421
01:18:16,302 --> 01:18:21,140
Diving stations.
Stand by all main vents.

422
01:19:21,992 --> 01:19:26,121
Nothing exciting out there?

423
01:19:28,624 --> 01:19:35,923
Position reports and very faint
SOS calls from enemy freighters.

424
01:19:39,259 --> 01:19:43,555
When the rudder breaks
on one of those old tenders ...

425
01:19:47,142 --> 01:19:50,937
... there's nothing to do but pray.

426
01:19:54,941 --> 01:20:02,157
The sea can't sink us, Hinrich.
No ships are as safe as our U-boats.

427
01:20:14,002 --> 01:20:16,922
Hinrich.

428
01:20:17,088 --> 01:20:23,678
Put the record on again.
You know the one.

429
01:21:35,208 --> 01:21:37,585
Watch out!

430
01:21:48,304 --> 01:21:50,557
Look out!

431
01:21:56,271 --> 01:21:58,940
Man overboard!

432
01:22:01,609 --> 01:22:04,529
Pilgrim!

433
01:22:08,199 --> 01:22:10,910
Hold on!

434
01:22:36,477 --> 01:22:41,774
- Get his legs.
- I've got him. Make way!

435
01:22:43,109 --> 01:22:47,989
- His legs!
- Hurry, will you? Move!

436
01:22:48,781 --> 01:22:53,744
- Lay him out flat.
- Get his hood off quickly.

437
01:22:53,911 --> 01:22:57,123
Pilgrim.

438
01:22:57,290 --> 01:23:02,795
Bring the first-aid kit, damn it!

439
01:23:02,962 --> 01:23:05,548
Prepare to dive.

440
01:23:14,807 --> 01:23:20,354
"Self-discipline is the only road
to military leadership ..."

441
01:23:22,815 --> 01:23:27,445
Three ribs cracked
and a gash on the head.

442
01:23:27,612 --> 01:23:30,823
He was lucky.

443
01:23:31,907 --> 01:23:38,581
What a rotten month.
Absolutely rotten.

444
01:23:39,957 --> 01:23:43,169
Mildew is good for you.

445
01:23:45,963 --> 01:23:52,094
It's the next best thing to ...
fresh-grown lettuce.

446
01:23:54,972 --> 01:24:01,687
Anything that grows on this boat
we've got to be grateful for.

447
01:24:07,777 --> 01:24:11,697
It must be snowing already
back home.

448
01:24:18,287 --> 01:24:21,248
Very funny.

449
01:24:22,917 --> 01:24:26,086
It's been years since I saw snow.

450
01:24:29,423 --> 01:24:32,968
- Can I look?
- Sure.

451
01:24:46,232 --> 01:24:48,859
Your wife?

452
01:25:53,507 --> 01:25:57,761
Look! There, in front!

453
01:26:02,474 --> 01:26:06,395
Captain, U-boat on port bow.

454
01:26:07,688 --> 01:26:11,441
It's one of ours.

455
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:20,242
A German U-boat! Over there!

456
01:26:25,914 --> 01:26:29,584
You're right.

457
01:26:29,751 --> 01:26:34,673
- Both engines stop.
- Bring up the lights.

458
01:27:05,662 --> 01:27:09,457
Look, it's Thomsen!

459
01:27:10,417 --> 01:27:15,297
- All back.
- It's Thomsen!

460
01:27:29,686 --> 01:27:34,649
Good hunting, you old rascal!

461
01:27:42,866 --> 01:27:49,247
My God, Phillip!
So they pushed you out to sea again.

462
01:27:55,795 --> 01:27:55,837
Damn it! How can this happen?

463
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:59,632
Damn it! How can this happen?

464
01:28:02,177 --> 01:28:09,058
12 boats we've got on the Atlantic,
from Greenland to the Azores.

465
01:28:09,225 --> 01:28:14,939
But still we almost collide
with one of our own.

466
01:28:15,106 --> 01:28:19,986
60 metres. Boat is trimmed, sir.

467
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:26,159
Something is wrong here.

468
01:28:28,119 --> 01:28:32,457
- Have you checked on our position?
- More or less.

469
01:28:32,624 --> 01:28:36,377
More or less is not good enough!

470
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:43,259
We've not had a sun shot in 14 days.
We've been drifting in this storm.

471
01:28:43,426 --> 01:28:47,263
It's hard to compute.

472
01:28:53,645 --> 01:29:01,319
If we make an error in our position,
and the others do the same, -

473
01:29:01,486 --> 01:29:05,990
- we end up playing collision games.
The route is wide open.

474
01:29:06,157 --> 01:29:11,996
The British could shove
the whole armada through.

475
01:29:12,163 --> 01:29:15,416
Yeah, yeah ...

476
01:29:18,127 --> 01:29:23,174
Another story in the middle
of the ocean, Lieutenant.

477
01:29:23,341 --> 01:29:29,305
I hope you're making notes. Maybe
headquarters will listen to you.

478
01:29:29,472 --> 01:29:36,979
- You've more influence than I have.
- So ... you believe that?

479
01:29:50,785 --> 01:29:58,000
Have you got your flashlight ready?
It's bound to be a false alarm.

480
01:30:05,466 --> 01:30:10,471
- What's up?
- A convoy.

481
01:30:24,318 --> 01:30:29,448
- Permission to come up?
- Permitted.

482
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:22,960
Outward bound convoy. Five columns.
Very juicy.

483
01:31:26,463 --> 01:31:30,509
Any escorts in sight? Destroyers?

484
01:31:30,676 --> 01:31:36,348
No, no screen.
They have no protection. Nothing.

485
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,064
That's funny.

486
01:31:45,983 --> 01:31:51,321
They could be off
chasing one of ours.

487
01:31:57,995 --> 01:32:01,790
That damn moon!

488
01:32:04,084 --> 01:32:08,922
- How many of our boats are here?
- Five.

489
01:32:11,550 --> 01:32:14,678
Do we risk it?

490
01:32:16,722 --> 01:32:20,934
It's worth a try, Captain.

491
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:24,897
Come left to 180.

492
01:32:25,063 --> 01:32:29,359
Left 5 degrees rudder.
New course: 180.

493
01:32:29,526 --> 01:32:33,238
Steady on course 180.

494
01:32:34,114 --> 01:32:38,243
Kriechbaum, what's your feeling?

495
01:32:40,579 --> 01:32:44,249
It'll work. We've got them.

496
01:32:56,011 --> 01:33:01,266
Prepare tubes one to four
for surface firing.

497
01:33:01,433 --> 01:33:06,772
- I'm going in.
- Master-sight to bridge.

498
01:33:09,566 --> 01:33:12,694
Tubes one to four flooded.

499
01:33:26,041 --> 01:33:30,837
All ahead full. Left full rudder.
Stand by to attack!

500
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:39,471
Watch the pressure
of the lubricating oil.

501
01:33:40,931 --> 01:33:45,936
- Bearing: 050.
- Locked on.

502
01:33:46,102 --> 01:33:49,064
Range: 2,200 metres.

503
01:33:49,231 --> 01:33:55,862
Those two over that way.
Then we'll drop on the big one.

504
01:33:56,029 --> 01:34:02,786
- Targets identified.
- Open the bow caps.

505
01:34:02,953 --> 01:34:09,751
Lock on tubes one and two.
New bow angle: 063.

506
01:34:09,918 --> 01:34:14,047
Follow for bearing.

507
01:34:14,214 --> 01:34:20,762
Tubes one and two,
fire when matched.

508
01:34:20,929 --> 01:34:23,431
Tube one, fire!

509
01:34:25,767 --> 01:34:30,730
Tube two, fire!

510
01:34:30,897 --> 01:34:35,610
- Tube three, fire when matched.
- Tube three ready.

511
01:34:35,777 --> 01:34:39,489
Tube three, fire!

512
01:34:40,115 --> 01:34:47,122
Tube four ready.
Tube four, fire!

513
01:34:47,288 --> 01:34:50,291
Destroyer ahead!

514
01:34:53,711 --> 01:34:56,714
Alarm!

515
01:34:56,881 --> 01:35:01,594
All men forward! Diving positions!

516
01:35:03,805 --> 01:35:07,350
Quick, keep it moving!

517
01:35:07,517 --> 01:35:12,397
- Clear the way.
- Move, move, move!

518
01:35:24,075 --> 01:35:28,621
- Battle stations!
- Out of the way.

519
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:35,878
Bow planes up 10. Stern up 5.

520
01:35:36,671 --> 01:35:40,008
Keep quite!

521
01:35:40,633 --> 01:35:44,595
Down 80 metres. Easy.

522
01:35:44,762 --> 01:35:50,309
Bow down 15. Stern up 10.

523
01:35:52,854 --> 01:35:58,484
- What about the torpedoes?
- Any minute now.

524
01:36:03,114 --> 01:36:06,659
Not long to go now.

525
01:36:06,826 --> 01:36:09,829
1 10 ...

526
01:36:16,836 --> 01:36:22,717
- 120.
- Those torpedoes don't run true.

527
01:36:22,884 --> 01:36:30,683
It was crazy to attack like that.
That destroy won't let us go.

528
01:36:31,893 --> 01:36:36,147
He'll try and hunt us down.

529
01:36:43,362 --> 01:36:49,035
- We hit the first.
- Out of the way. We hit her!

530
01:36:50,119 --> 01:36:53,164
Quiet!

531
01:37:15,519 --> 01:37:19,607
Time's up for the third torpedo.

532
01:37:24,361 --> 01:37:27,239
Number three.

533
01:37:42,379 --> 01:37:46,008
Now they are going to the bottom.

534
01:37:58,354 --> 01:38:02,441
It's the bulkheads.
They've collapsed.

535
01:38:19,667 --> 01:38:22,795
This is it.

536
01:38:26,548 --> 01:38:29,718
Now we have the payoff.

537
01:38:39,144 --> 01:38:45,859
Destroyer bearing 044.
Moving left. Fading, sir.

538
01:39:00,707 --> 01:39:05,838
Right full rudder.
Both engines ahead two-thirds.

539
01:39:06,004 --> 01:39:11,718
Rudder's right full.
Both engines ahead two-thirds.

540
01:39:11,885 --> 01:39:15,806
They're astern of us ...

541
01:39:17,224 --> 01:39:21,186
... way astern of us.

542
01:39:23,647 --> 01:39:27,609
They're spitting
in the wrong direction.

543
01:39:35,409 --> 01:39:41,999
We haven't thrown them off yet.
I reckon they won't be too happy.

544
01:39:42,165 --> 01:39:49,047
Propeller noises bearing 270.
Closing.

545
01:39:50,006 --> 01:39:55,137
Both engines ahead one-third.

546
01:40:01,893 --> 01:40:07,899
- Both engines ahead one-third.
- Now we'll see.

547
01:40:34,551 --> 01:40:40,724
All ahead full.
Pump out 150 litres.

548
01:40:44,728 --> 01:40:48,523
Pump out 150 litres. Ahead full!

549
01:41:43,036 --> 01:41:49,125
Asdic detection system.
Ultrasonic.

550
01:41:54,255 --> 01:41:59,427
The filthy rotten swine!

551
01:42:11,397 --> 01:42:17,028
- What's the damage?
- Air shaft fractured.

552
01:42:21,324 --> 01:42:25,703
Quiet, boys.

553
01:42:27,038 --> 01:42:30,750
Nice and quiet now.

554
01:43:17,255 --> 01:43:22,218
- Hold that speed.
- 50 rpm.

555
01:43:23,135 --> 01:43:26,931
Left 15 degrees.

556
01:43:28,808 --> 01:43:32,687
Steering left 15, sir.

557
01:43:45,574 --> 01:43:49,245
All ahead full!

558
01:43:50,996 --> 01:43:54,166
Let's get the hell out of here!

559
01:43:59,755 --> 01:44:05,970
- One of the valves is fractured!
- Isolate it!

560
01:44:09,849 --> 01:44:13,519
God! We're on fire!

561
01:44:13,686 --> 01:44:19,066
Cut the number two auxiliary!

562
01:44:22,945 --> 01:44:26,782
Calm down for God's sake!

563
01:44:51,598 --> 01:44:59,356
- Chief, emergency ventilation.
- Switch on fans.

564
01:45:27,885 --> 01:45:33,515
She doesn't want to let go of us.

565
01:45:41,857 --> 01:45:47,029
What's going on? Running away?

566
01:46:01,293 --> 01:46:09,384
We really smashed them.
Did you hear those bulkheads burst?

567
01:46:22,230 --> 01:46:28,945
- What's her bearing?
- 065. Bearing constant.

568
01:46:32,324 --> 01:46:36,953
Deeper, Chief. Silent speed.

569
01:47:01,186 --> 01:47:04,272
Bearing?

570
01:47:05,357 --> 01:47:10,362
050. Growing louder.

571
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:25,752
Yeah, yeah ...

572
01:47:31,591 --> 01:47:34,594
Yeah, sure.

573
01:47:43,937 --> 01:47:48,608
Deeper still. Right 30 degrees.

574
01:47:48,775 --> 01:47:55,615
We'll try doubling back.
Keep them guessing.

575
01:48:02,747 --> 01:48:07,544
Bow planes steady. Stern up 10.

576
01:48:55,049 --> 01:48:59,429
Contact bearing 270.

577
01:49:01,097 --> 01:49:05,017
It's fading.

578
01:49:18,990 --> 01:49:25,913
- Right full rudder.
- Rudder is full right, sir.

579
01:49:26,581 --> 01:49:30,960
Steer 090.

580
01:49:48,352 --> 01:49:50,479
No!

581
01:49:52,189 --> 01:49:56,902
Second contact closing fast.
Bearing: 076.

582
01:49:59,947 --> 01:50:03,451
Damn them!

583
01:50:04,744 --> 01:50:08,622
Another one.

584
01:50:38,402 --> 01:50:43,407
- Deeper.
- Sir ..?

585
01:50:44,825 --> 01:50:48,496
Yes, deeper.

586
01:50:51,415 --> 01:50:54,919
Bow planes down 10. Stern up 7.

587
01:51:13,145 --> 01:51:17,358
190 metres.

588
01:51:26,408 --> 01:51:28,535
200 metres.

589
01:51:40,714 --> 01:51:43,175
210 metres.

590
01:51:51,308 --> 01:51:54,394
220 metres.

591
01:52:00,901 --> 01:52:04,029
230 metres.

592
01:52:14,790 --> 01:52:19,586
- The bolts are bursting!
- 10 metres rise.

593
01:52:19,753 --> 01:52:23,507
All ahead.

594
01:52:29,054 --> 01:52:32,224
Quiet, men!

595
01:53:00,502 --> 01:53:03,255
Quiet.

596
01:53:12,556 --> 01:53:18,061
Bring her up to 150 metres!
Full ahead!

597
01:53:20,355 --> 01:53:23,984
Full ahead both, sir.

598
01:53:24,151 --> 01:53:29,656
Left 20 degrees.
Steer 050.

599
01:53:29,823 --> 01:53:33,243
He is near his mark.

600
01:53:37,289 --> 01:53:40,876
The foundation bolts are loose!

601
01:54:12,324 --> 01:54:19,581
- I want accurate damage reports.
- Water's pouring in!

602
01:54:24,210 --> 01:54:30,425
- The engine room is leaking water!
- I'll go and take a look.

603
01:54:30,592 --> 01:54:33,845
Number One, take over.

604
01:54:35,972 --> 01:54:38,725
It's the exhaust flap.

605
01:54:38,892 --> 01:54:44,981
- The plunge bolts have sheared.
- The gaskets!

606
01:54:46,858 --> 01:54:50,778
Bring me new gaskets. Move it!

607
01:54:51,446 --> 01:54:57,076
- Torpedo hatch taking water.
- Give us some light.

608
01:55:00,496 --> 01:55:04,542
Crow bar!

609
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:13,301
They'll soon be out of ammunition.

610
01:55:28,107 --> 01:55:31,861
The exhaust flap is secured, sir.

611
01:55:32,028 --> 01:55:38,826
- 50 metres. All ahead full.
- Torpedo hatch is secured.

612
01:55:53,424 --> 01:55:56,719
What's wrong, Johann?

613
01:56:02,391 --> 01:56:08,606
Get back to your battle station,
right now.

614
01:56:18,491 --> 01:56:24,830
Don't disobey my orders.
Do as you're told!

615
01:56:28,167 --> 01:56:32,046
I order you, Johann.

616
01:56:33,631 --> 01:56:37,426
Aft, Johann!

617
01:56:42,848 --> 01:56:49,397
Take him aft, boys.
Hold him down.

618
01:56:55,277 --> 01:56:58,781
He's under control.

619
01:57:38,821 --> 01:57:44,577
Who'd have thought it of Johann?

620
01:57:45,202 --> 01:57:50,916
Degrading. Shameful.

621
01:58:09,935 --> 01:58:14,940
Forget it, Hinrich.
We can hear them.

622
01:58:38,505 --> 01:58:40,299
That's it. Come on.

623
01:59:00,777 --> 01:59:03,780
170 metres.

624
01:59:06,366 --> 01:59:10,162
190 metres.

625
01:59:12,289 --> 01:59:15,083
200.

626
01:59:38,190 --> 01:59:43,904
- Man your stations.
- 220 metres!

627
01:59:44,071 --> 01:59:47,532
We're sinking!

628
01:59:48,075 --> 01:59:51,244
We're sinking!

629
02:00:56,601 --> 02:01:02,732
- Make a note for the war diary.
- Aye-aye, Captain.

630
02:01:04,025 --> 02:01:10,990
Stayed submerged for six hours
at silent speed.

631
02:01:11,157 --> 02:01:15,286
Satisfied
the destroyers have lost us.

632
02:01:16,538 --> 02:01:24,003
Intense glow in sky
observed at 210 degrees.

633
02:01:24,170 --> 02:01:29,300
Probably flames
from the tanker we hit.

634
02:01:36,391 --> 02:01:43,523
- We'll surface in ten minutes.
- Switch to red light.

635
02:01:49,696 --> 02:01:53,366
First watch, stand by for duty.

636
02:02:18,349 --> 02:02:21,561
You see, Lieutenant ...

637
02:02:23,563 --> 02:02:27,400
... they didn't kill us.

638
02:03:32,965 --> 02:03:36,552
Her back's already broken.

639
02:03:38,679 --> 02:03:43,059
She is a tough one.
She won't go down.

640
02:03:44,977 --> 02:03:52,651
Let's finish her off.
A final shot. Prepare to fire.

641
02:03:53,736 --> 02:03:59,325
Number one tube is flooded.
Ready for surface firing.

642
02:03:59,492 --> 02:04:05,623
Target's speed: Zero.
Range: 650 metres.

643
02:04:05,789 --> 02:04:09,960
Depth: Four metres.
Torpedo speed: 30.

644
02:04:10,127 --> 02:04:14,715
Aiming point: Forward of aft mast.

645
02:04:14,882 --> 02:04:18,594
Tube one ready.

646
02:04:18,761 --> 02:04:22,306
Tube one ... Fire!

647
02:05:05,390 --> 02:05:09,478
- There are still men on board.
- There!

648
02:05:20,405 --> 02:05:25,244
Why didn't their own ships
rescue them?

649
02:05:25,410 --> 02:05:28,247
They've had six hours.

650
02:05:54,439 --> 02:06:01,154
- They're swimming towards us.
- Both engines back two-thirds.

651
02:06:01,321 --> 02:06:04,950
We can't take prisoners.
You know that.

652
02:07:17,355 --> 02:07:21,234
May I clear the table, sir?

653
02:07:46,426 --> 02:07:49,846
Here, take it.

654
02:07:53,266 --> 02:07:57,770
- Some more signals, sir.
- Go ahead.

655
02:07:57,937 --> 02:08:02,692
"Three freighters sunk.
Convoy dispersed into groups."

656
02:08:02,859 --> 02:08:08,615
Contact broken.
Closing course: 030. U-1 12.

657
02:08:10,033 --> 02:08:13,703
Wenzel ... not bad.

658
02:08:13,870 --> 02:08:21,002
Kupsch is on the same convoy.
Stackmann torpedoed a 6,000 tonner.

659
02:08:23,630 --> 02:08:28,885
They're having a field day.
Any hope of joining them?

660
02:08:31,971 --> 02:08:37,560
Difficult. A minimum
of five hours away at full speed.

661
02:08:37,727 --> 02:08:42,273
- We can't make it.
- Yes, yes!

662
02:09:04,879 --> 02:09:08,549
Sir, when do we go back?

663
02:09:14,639 --> 02:09:20,394
When it's time for us to go back ...
and not before, Kriechbaum.

664
02:09:52,635 --> 02:09:57,682
"Fired at 950 metres.
Targeted aft mast."

665
02:09:57,848 --> 02:10:02,019
"Crew was still on board.
Swam toward U-96."

666
02:10:37,596 --> 02:10:40,975
Captain ...

667
02:10:43,018 --> 02:10:49,650
- I wish to apologize.
- There's nothing to be said.

668
02:10:50,651 --> 02:10:57,616
You deserted your post at a critical
moment and disobeyed a direct order.

669
02:11:09,962 --> 02:11:16,385
You mean to say that
there has to be a court martial?

670
02:11:20,681 --> 02:11:25,477
- How many patrols have you done?
- Nine, sir.

671
02:11:31,483 --> 02:11:34,403
Why you, Johann?

672
02:11:37,364 --> 02:11:43,203
It was a mistake.
I didn't ... It was ...

673
02:11:43,370 --> 02:11:46,331
It ...

674
02:11:49,334 --> 02:11:56,216
All of a sudden ... As if ...

675
02:11:59,261 --> 02:12:04,892
It won't ever happen again, sir.
You can depend on it.

676
02:12:06,393 --> 02:12:13,317
- I swear.
- All right, Johann.

677
02:12:14,818 --> 02:12:20,198
Then there's no court martial?

678
02:12:23,660 --> 02:12:27,539
Get some sleep.

679
02:12:40,969 --> 02:12:45,932
Decision, return to La Rochelle.

680
02:13:03,575 --> 02:13:04,534
Cipher officer.

681
02:13:04,534 --> 02:13:06,620
Cipher officer.

682
02:13:11,917 --> 02:13:16,296
- Have you found the problem?
- It's the bulkhead conduit.

683
02:13:16,463 --> 02:13:20,050
Good, get it fixed.

684
02:13:21,593 --> 02:13:24,679
Good morning.

685
02:13:24,846 --> 02:13:29,267
Get moving.
There's a signal to be decoded.

686
02:13:36,441 --> 02:13:42,781
Suppose it's top secret.
Another wild goose chase.

687
02:13:42,948 --> 02:13:47,285
They're not much use to us.
This relic needs a refit.

688
02:13:47,452 --> 02:13:52,374
On the fuel we've got
we won't even make La Rochelle.

689
02:13:52,540 --> 02:13:57,545
We'll hoist a sail.
Don't worry, Chief.

690
02:13:59,339 --> 02:14:03,218
Decoded it yet?

691
02:14:04,761 --> 02:14:11,142
- What is it?
- Top secret. For the captain only.

692
02:14:35,250 --> 02:14:40,004
Very strange.
It's triple enciphered.

693
02:14:47,178 --> 02:14:52,141
Christmas in La Rochelle.
Real girls in Christmas stockings.

694
02:14:52,308 --> 02:14:58,064
Sexy little nurses
to comfort and kiss.

695
02:14:58,231 --> 02:15:03,820
- We'll have a ball!
- A Valkyrie, big and fat.

696
02:15:04,737 --> 02:15:10,660
Now here this.
La Rochelle is out. I'm sorry.

697
02:15:10,827 --> 02:15:18,376
We have a new destination.
La Spezia Naval Base in ltaly.

698
02:15:18,543 --> 02:15:25,675
We'll pick up fuel and supplies
at Vigo in Spain. That's all.

699
02:15:28,469 --> 02:15:33,641
Swine. He must be crazy.

700
02:15:34,434 --> 02:15:39,272
- What a rotten trick.
- There goes our Christmas stocking.

701
02:15:39,439 --> 02:15:46,946
- No sexy little nurses.
- I'd like to kill those morons!

702
02:15:47,113 --> 02:15:52,535
- We'll have Christmas in ltaly.
- We've got to get there first!

703
02:15:52,702 --> 02:15:56,914
- And so?
- Gibraltar!

704
02:15:57,081 --> 02:16:01,544
Use your brain, you idiot!
That strait ...

705
02:16:04,881 --> 02:16:12,179
It's like the eye of a needle.
We'll never slip through there.

706
02:16:28,154 --> 02:16:35,494
The Mediterranean. It's madness.
It's swarming with combat ships.

707
02:16:35,661 --> 02:16:43,127
Stand by ...
Zero. 25 degrees, 43.3 minutes.

708
02:16:45,212 --> 02:16:50,718
Gibraltar. It's the best chance
to get ourselves killed.

709
02:17:05,191 --> 02:17:10,488
When we reach Vigo,
you go ashore with the chief.

710
02:17:10,654 --> 02:17:16,035
- But, sir ...
- I've already made the decision.

711
02:17:18,787 --> 02:17:24,293
I've got to find
a replacement for the chief.

712
02:17:25,377 --> 02:17:30,257
Our agents will smuggle you
out of Spain somehow.

713
02:17:30,424 --> 02:17:34,220
Dressed up as gypsies, for instance.

714
02:17:34,386 --> 02:17:40,267
- I thought I would be going ...
- No arguments.

715
02:17:40,434 --> 02:17:46,607
It's all settled.
It's easier to get two of you out.

716
02:17:49,693 --> 02:17:54,114
I really believe
the chief needs a break.

717
02:18:05,793 --> 02:18:09,129
His wife is very ill.

718
02:18:11,632 --> 02:18:15,052
He must get home.

719
02:18:19,098 --> 02:18:22,726
I understand, sir.

720
02:18:36,615 --> 02:18:40,118
Tough break.

721
02:18:50,796 --> 02:18:57,302
When we reach Vigo, it's goodbye.
The captain's ordered me ashore.

722
02:18:58,971 --> 02:19:03,183
The chief leaves, too.

723
02:19:05,602 --> 02:19:10,899
I ... could deliver
your mail for you.

724
02:19:18,907 --> 02:19:22,035
Yeah.

725
02:19:28,333 --> 02:19:32,045
There's quite a bunch of them here.

726
02:19:34,923 --> 02:19:38,844
Well, it's quite a romance,
isn't it?

727
02:20:19,009 --> 02:20:22,137
Equalize.

728
02:20:31,771 --> 02:20:36,651
- Help me out with the gear.
- Quiet, men!

729
02:20:36,818 --> 02:20:43,742
All ahead one-third.
Left 10 degrees rudder.

730
02:20:43,908 --> 02:20:49,164
Now we just have to find
this little barge.

731
02:20:49,330 --> 02:20:53,001
"SS Weser."

732
02:20:53,168 --> 02:20:57,464
A German merchant ship.
She's got herself interned here.

733
02:20:57,630 --> 02:21:04,888
- With torpedoes, fuel and supplies.
- All for us, Kriechbaum.

734
02:21:05,054 --> 02:21:08,475
First-class service.

735
02:21:20,820 --> 02:21:20,987
Starboard engines stop.

736
02:21:20,987 --> 02:21:24,490
Starboard engines stop.

737
02:21:25,408 --> 02:21:30,413
- We arrived.
- Port engines stop.

738
02:21:38,087 --> 02:21:41,841
Officers to bridge.

739
02:21:55,605 --> 02:21:58,733
Gentlemen ...

740
02:22:03,446 --> 02:22:06,491
Three cheers
for our galant U-boat men.

741
02:22:19,378 --> 02:22:25,134
- You are most welcome, Captain.
- No, no ...

742
02:22:26,427 --> 02:22:32,975
- This is our commander.
- My apologies, sir.

743
02:22:34,727 --> 02:22:39,690
A pleasure to have you aboard
the "Weser", Captain.

744
02:22:39,857 --> 02:22:45,112
A hero.
I'm delighted to be so honoured.

745
02:22:45,279 --> 02:22:51,577
Gentlemen, here they stand,
our heroes of the deep.

746
02:22:52,286 --> 02:23:00,586
The grey wolves.
Our humble ship is honoured.

747
02:23:00,753 --> 02:23:04,006
Captain, lead the way.

748
02:23:04,173 --> 02:23:08,678
- Welcome on board.
- What a nice clean tugboat.

749
02:23:09,679 --> 02:23:17,269
We've done what we can for you.
I hope it's to your taste.

750
02:23:17,436 --> 02:23:21,399
Quite a table. Just like home.

751
02:23:21,565 --> 02:23:28,948
Fresh bread. Cakes. Fruit.
Sausage, our chef's specialty.

752
02:23:29,115 --> 02:23:33,911
We're waiting to hear your news.

753
02:23:34,078 --> 02:23:38,040
You can't imagine
what it means to us.

754
02:23:38,207 --> 02:23:41,710
It isn't easy here.
It's very frustrating.

755
02:23:41,877 --> 02:23:45,422
Sure, there's plenty to eat.
Fuel is no problem.

756
02:23:45,589 --> 02:23:53,055
Torpedoes are very tricky though ...
but you're all set up.

757
02:23:53,222 --> 02:24:00,437
The Spaniards tolerate us, but
that's about all. Christmas cake.

758
02:24:02,565 --> 02:24:09,321
How many ship have you sunk?
I guess about ...

759
02:24:09,488 --> 02:24:14,243
Oh, champagne. Take a glass.

760
02:24:14,785 --> 02:24:21,417
Gentlemen, raise your glasses.
Drink to our heroes.

761
02:24:21,583 --> 02:24:29,216
To the German U-boat service
and out beloved Fuhrer ...

762
02:24:30,759 --> 02:24:35,472
We're not exactly at home ...
if you understand what I mean.

763
02:24:35,639 --> 02:24:37,975
All the best.

764
02:24:42,688 --> 02:24:49,903
- There's plenty for everyone.
- Let's get down to business.

765
02:24:53,741 --> 02:25:00,414
Tell us all about it, Captain.
I'm bursting with curiosity.

766
02:25:00,581 --> 02:25:04,001
Those are fresh figs.

767
02:25:05,961 --> 02:25:09,047
Fresh figs!

768
02:25:10,799 --> 02:25:15,012
I've never had one.

769
02:25:18,348 --> 02:25:22,519
Yeah ...

770
02:25:25,939 --> 02:25:31,153
This time we very nearly had it.

771
02:25:33,822 --> 02:25:40,370
Phenomenal. You see, gentlemen,
that's the stuff heroes are made of.

772
02:25:40,537 --> 02:25:45,667
Phenomenal, that's what it is.
I want to hear more, Captain.

773
02:25:45,834 --> 02:25:53,592
Give me your plate. Herring salad.
The chef's mother's own recipe.

774
02:25:55,093 --> 02:25:59,890
Just taste that. There's lots more.

775
02:26:00,057 --> 02:26:07,606
So ...
what's it like to be under water -

776
02:26:07,773 --> 02:26:11,151
- while overhead
the enemy lies in wait?

777
02:26:11,318 --> 02:26:15,781
- It's dark.
- Dark?

778
02:26:15,947 --> 02:26:22,120
- Yes, and very quiet.
- Just as long as no one belches.

779
02:26:22,287 --> 02:26:27,918
- Why is that?
- I can explain what he means.

780
02:26:28,084 --> 02:26:31,463
We're often running at silent speed.

781
02:26:31,630 --> 02:26:37,260
- And that's why you can't belch!
- The men from Madrid are here.

782
02:26:37,427 --> 02:26:40,889
Seewald, we've been expecting you.
Captain, over here.

783
02:26:44,226 --> 02:26:49,105
The representative
of our naval attache here.

784
02:26:49,272 --> 02:26:52,776
I have some
communications from Berlin.

785
02:26:53,860 --> 02:26:57,739
First the documents
for the breakthrough.

786
02:26:58,740 --> 02:27:03,036
Then ... this cable came.

787
02:27:14,089 --> 02:27:17,217
Chief, Lt. Werner.

788
02:27:20,804 --> 02:27:24,349
We are going for a little fresh air.

789
02:27:32,148 --> 02:27:36,569
- What's happening, Seewald?
- Bad news.

790
02:27:42,200 --> 02:27:47,664
Headquarters say no.
Our request has been denied, Chief.

791
02:27:50,834 --> 02:27:57,215
There's no replacement.
You'll stay too, Werner.

792
02:28:02,303 --> 02:28:05,431
I'm sorry.

793
02:28:07,767 --> 02:28:11,271
I guess it's just as well.

794
02:28:13,189 --> 02:28:18,403
Who knows what kind of idiot
they'd have sent you.

795
02:28:19,862 --> 02:28:24,033
One of those new found warriors
who's all wind and smoke.

796
02:28:29,747 --> 02:28:32,917
You could be right.

797
02:28:33,084 --> 02:28:36,754
They could have sent us
some senoritas.

798
02:28:36,921 --> 02:28:43,678
It's a good thing they didn't.
Spanish crabs. That's all we'd need.

799
02:28:43,845 --> 02:28:49,434
Get that chart table cleared.
I can't navigate on bananas.

800
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:55,273
What do you think you're doing?
Get that fruit out of here.

801
02:28:57,316 --> 02:29:03,531
- Is that a Christmas tree?
- No, camouflage for the bridge.

802
02:29:05,658 --> 02:29:09,412
We're staying.
They won't replace us.

803
02:29:21,048 --> 02:29:24,260
I'm sorry, Ullman.

804
02:29:40,401 --> 02:29:43,529
7 miles from coast to coast.
A bit narrow.

805
02:29:43,529 --> 02:29:46,282
7 miles from coast to coast.
A bit narrow.

806
02:29:48,367 --> 02:29:55,207
These are the only British dockyards
in the western Mediterranen.

807
02:29:57,209 --> 02:30:00,713
They are very heavily defended.

808
02:30:03,674 --> 02:30:08,179
The place will be crawling
with patrol boats.

809
02:30:08,345 --> 02:30:13,267
Anything that floats
will be on the water.

810
02:30:15,895 --> 02:30:21,525
This is where we have to go.
That's the situation.

811
02:30:34,205 --> 02:30:40,252
We move in under darkness.
On the surface.

812
02:30:44,089 --> 02:30:47,718
We'll see if we can slip through.

813
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:55,517
As near to Gibraltar as we can get.

814
02:31:04,902 --> 02:31:10,824
Then dive down
and let ourselves drift through.

815
02:31:15,913 --> 02:31:19,375
And so ...

816
02:31:21,293 --> 02:31:28,717
... dive and let the surface current
pull us through the Strait.

817
02:31:30,010 --> 02:31:34,014
It's an easy trick.

818
02:31:34,640 --> 02:31:40,896
Quiet as a shadow
and we burn less fuel.

819
02:31:49,822 --> 02:31:53,575
Well, Kriechbaum?

820
02:31:58,121 --> 02:32:01,917
Clever trick, Captain.

821
02:32:25,816 --> 02:32:29,277
Right, let's get going.

822
02:32:33,448 --> 02:32:37,202
All ahead two-thirds.

823
02:32:39,913 --> 02:32:44,543
The navigator and I stay up here.
Now clear the bridge.

824
02:33:01,059 --> 02:33:07,482
- Come right to 079.
- Course: 079.

825
02:33:16,157 --> 02:33:19,452
Half the British fleet is out there.

826
02:33:20,662 --> 02:33:27,210
Come left 20 degrees.
Change to main motors.

827
02:33:28,044 --> 02:33:34,050
It's very kind of the enemy
to show their navigation lights.

828
02:33:37,053 --> 02:33:42,100
Come left another 10.
Steer 050.

829
02:33:42,267 --> 02:33:45,020
Course: 050.

830
02:34:00,076 --> 02:34:05,039
Destroyer on port bow.
Range: 800.

831
02:34:05,206 --> 02:34:08,460
Going which way?
Is she closing?

832
02:34:15,508 --> 02:34:19,304
- No, she's heading away.
- That's good.

833
02:34:22,474 --> 02:34:26,311
Left full rudder. All ahead full.

834
02:34:26,478 --> 02:34:30,648
Rudder is left full.
All engines indicate ahead full.

835
02:34:32,901 --> 02:34:35,653
Steady as you go.

836
02:34:52,337 --> 02:34:59,260
- Come right. Course: 079.
- Course: 079.

837
02:34:59,427 --> 02:35:05,892
- All ahead two-thirds.
- Engines indicate ahead two-thirds.

838
02:35:27,914 --> 02:35:31,209
Right full rudder. Quick!

839
02:35:31,375 --> 02:35:34,545
- Right full rudder.
- Damn!

840
02:35:47,391 --> 02:35:50,853
Kriechbaum ...

841
02:35:52,688 --> 02:35:55,691
Gibraltar.

842
02:36:17,254 --> 02:36:19,632
We'll dive in 10 minutes.

843
02:36:35,022 --> 02:36:38,067
Alarm!

844
02:36:42,822 --> 02:36:47,993
- Alarm!
- Don't dive! The captain's up top!

845
02:36:49,787 --> 02:36:55,751
Navigator wounded.
Start flooding!

846
02:36:55,918 --> 02:36:59,880
Stand by escape gear.
Ready to abandon ship!

847
02:37:00,506 --> 02:37:07,388
- Where's the escape gear?
- Calm down!

848
02:37:07,555 --> 02:37:10,266
Bring the medic!

849
02:37:10,432 --> 02:37:16,939
Both engines maximum power.
Hard starboard.

850
02:37:17,106 --> 02:37:23,612
Easy. Here, take this.
Okay, we'll fix you up.

851
02:37:28,200 --> 02:37:33,372
Faster! Faster!

852
02:37:41,839 --> 02:37:44,258
Compresses!

853
02:37:50,055 --> 02:37:55,853
- Out of the way!
- Silence on board!

854
02:37:56,020 --> 02:38:01,191
- The port engine belt is loose.
- Maintain full power, Chief!

855
02:38:01,358 --> 02:38:04,945
All the power you've got!

856
02:38:05,112 --> 02:38:11,118
- Where the hell's he going?
- Due south. The African coastline.

857
02:38:19,585 --> 02:38:22,296
Damn it!

858
02:38:24,548 --> 02:38:30,554
- Alarm!
- Ready to dive! All hands forward!

859
02:38:36,310 --> 02:38:42,357
- Move! Clear the way!
- 90 metres. Quick!

860
02:38:42,524 --> 02:38:46,945
Bow planes zero.
Stern planes up 5. Shut vents.

861
02:38:47,112 --> 02:38:52,242
- Bow planes out of action!
- Switch to manual.

862
02:38:52,409 --> 02:38:56,121
The bow plane has jammed on dive.

863
02:39:01,418 --> 02:39:05,756
Damn it! All engines stop.

864
02:39:05,922 --> 02:39:12,262
- All men go aft!
- Hurry!

865
02:39:14,848 --> 02:39:20,937
- Move! Pump everything aft.
- Auxiliary pump out of action.

866
02:39:21,104 --> 02:39:25,984
- Blow forward tanks!
- Forward tanks blown.

867
02:39:26,151 --> 02:39:33,950
- She's still going down.
- We've got to shed some weight.

868
02:39:35,786 --> 02:39:39,956
Keep him quiet!

869
02:39:40,123 --> 02:39:46,296
- Main pump out of action!
- Permission to blow?

870
02:39:46,463 --> 02:39:49,758
Hard astern full.

871
02:39:52,719 --> 02:39:58,058
- No effect.
- All right, blow.

872
02:39:58,225 --> 02:40:00,852
Blow forward ballast.

873
02:40:03,146 --> 02:40:05,523
Pull out!

874
02:40:07,943 --> 02:40:11,863
Damn you! Pull out!

875
02:40:12,030 --> 02:40:17,202
- All you've got, Chief!
- Blow all we've got.

876
02:40:21,790 --> 02:40:23,958
Pull up.

877
02:40:28,088 --> 02:40:31,299
Christ, please ...

878
02:40:45,522 --> 02:40:49,025
We can't hold her.

879
02:40:53,780 --> 02:40:56,783
200.

880
02:40:59,744 --> 02:41:02,455
210.

881
02:41:05,291 --> 02:41:08,169
220 metres.

882
02:41:09,045 --> 02:41:13,550
230. 240.

883
02:41:24,269 --> 02:41:30,191
- My God!
- Lord, turn not away from me.

884
02:41:30,358 --> 02:41:32,819
Take away all our sins.

885
02:42:23,494 --> 02:42:26,789
A shovel full of sand.

886
02:42:28,416 --> 02:42:33,546
The gods left a shovel full of sand
to keep us up.

887
02:42:43,806 --> 02:42:50,271
280 metres
and she's still in one piece!

888
02:43:38,027 --> 02:43:42,531
Torpedo hatch taking water!

889
02:43:43,240 --> 02:43:49,580
- Torpedo hatch taking water!
- Motor room taking water.

890
02:43:54,418 --> 02:43:58,464
We're taking water!

891
02:44:00,132 --> 02:44:04,678
- What do you need?
- Some timber for sawing.

892
02:44:06,639 --> 02:44:12,603
- Exhaust valve okay?
- I need the saw.

893
02:44:12,770 --> 02:44:16,398
Give me that flashlight.

894
02:44:17,358 --> 02:44:23,489
- I need a wrench.
- Water coming in!

895
02:44:23,656 --> 02:44:27,576
Where are the tools?

896
02:44:27,743 --> 02:44:34,875
- Bring me the tools.
- Where are you going?

897
02:44:35,042 --> 02:44:40,380
- Switchboard out of action.
- Give me proper damage reports!

898
02:44:40,547 --> 02:44:46,637
- We can't stop the flooding.
- With so much damage, we've had it.

899
02:44:46,804 --> 02:44:52,101
- Where's the most damage?
- Below, sir.

900
02:44:52,267 --> 02:44:56,855
Check the damage
to the batteries. Quickly!

901
02:44:58,941 --> 02:45:03,445
- Tighten that bolt.
- I can't see.

902
02:45:03,612 --> 02:45:07,824
Push as hard as you can.
It's stuck tight.

903
02:45:07,991 --> 02:45:11,036
I can't wedge it.

904
02:45:11,203 --> 02:45:15,874
- Give me the hammer.
- Take the wrench!

905
02:45:20,170 --> 02:45:25,759
- Do you need more men aft?
- I'll ask the lieutenant.

906
02:45:25,926 --> 02:45:29,888
This damn thing! Hold my light!

907
02:45:32,599 --> 02:45:39,314
You stupid son of a pig!
We've got work to do!

908
02:45:39,481 --> 02:45:46,446
- Tools from the engine room.
- Where's that damn wrench?

909
02:45:49,783 --> 02:45:54,955
- Bring another wrench.
- Hold the light.

910
02:45:55,789 --> 02:46:03,255
The bearings have seized.
It just keeps rising!

911
02:46:03,422 --> 02:46:06,925
Tighten the seals.
Don't shear the bolts.

912
02:46:07,801 --> 02:46:14,850
- The cooling system is leaking.
- Tighten the seals down there.

913
02:46:18,186 --> 02:46:25,694
Give me that shoring.
Take it, quickly!

914
02:46:25,861 --> 02:46:31,491
It's flooded down here.
Get me the biggest one.

915
02:46:31,658 --> 02:46:35,161
That's the biggest we can find.

916
02:46:35,829 --> 02:46:38,498
Higher!

917
02:46:40,792 --> 02:46:44,296
- Where do we put him?
- Easy, men.

918
02:46:44,462 --> 02:46:49,134
Captain,
the chief's looking for you.

919
02:46:54,931 --> 02:47:00,270
We're taking water fast.
The cooling sytem is blocked.

920
02:47:00,437 --> 02:47:06,401
The compressors are dislodged.

921
02:47:06,568 --> 02:47:10,655
Damn! What about fuel leaks?

922
02:47:10,822 --> 02:47:17,245
I can't tell as yet. Many of
the battery cells are cracked.

923
02:47:17,412 --> 02:47:20,331
Chlorine gas.

924
02:47:22,792 --> 02:47:26,254
It's red. Acid in the bilge.

925
02:47:26,421 --> 02:47:31,259
See how many cells have cracked.
Get some battery straps.

926
02:47:31,426 --> 02:47:35,680
- Battery straps!
- Get that out of the way.

927
02:47:35,847 --> 02:47:42,145
The chief needs battery straps,
make it quick!

928
02:47:48,776 --> 02:47:53,907
- It's still coming in.
- Get me the hammer.

929
02:47:58,202 --> 02:48:01,956
- Here!
- Thanks, Lieutenant.

930
02:48:04,834 --> 02:48:09,631
Get it in!

931
02:48:11,257 --> 02:48:16,262
- Watch out. Coming through.
- Quiet.

932
02:48:16,429 --> 02:48:19,307
Easy.

933
02:48:24,062 --> 02:48:29,984
Tell the chief the water is up to
the torpedo hatch and rising.

934
02:48:36,949 --> 02:48:39,327
I need light.

935
02:48:39,494 --> 02:48:45,374
Who's working on those shaft seals.
Tell them to hurry up.

936
02:48:47,251 --> 02:48:54,008
- 24 battery cells cracked.
- What a hell of a mess.

937
02:48:54,175 --> 02:48:59,889
- Battery straps.
- Come here with those.

938
02:49:01,933 --> 02:49:05,853
Let's hope these are enough.

939
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:13,945
Our only chance
is to bridge all the live cells.

940
02:49:16,614 --> 02:49:21,786
- It's no good. I can't see.
- More light.

941
02:49:22,370 --> 02:49:28,167
We've got to close the leaks
or it's all over for us.

942
02:49:34,256 --> 02:49:37,551
More to the right.

943
02:49:44,684 --> 02:49:50,940
- I need wire to bridge them.
- Wire for the battery cells.

944
02:49:59,698 --> 02:50:04,954
The chief needs wire.
Get moving. Did you hear me?

945
02:50:05,121 --> 02:50:11,293
We've got plenty of fancy torpedoes.
Each one is 25,000 marks.

946
02:50:11,460 --> 02:50:17,716
All they forget
is 50 pfennigs' worth of old wire!

947
02:50:17,883 --> 02:50:23,931
- Now what?
- The draining pump is jammed.

948
02:50:24,098 --> 02:50:27,852
- That's great.
- Captain.

949
02:50:28,018 --> 02:50:33,148
- Here.
- Better than nothing.

950
02:50:33,315 --> 02:50:36,151
Pliers!

951
02:50:38,654 --> 02:50:41,782
Captain ...

952
02:50:46,996 --> 02:50:51,041
All the leaks have been stopped.

953
02:50:54,378 --> 02:50:57,047
Good, Johann.

954
02:50:59,883 --> 02:51:03,429
That's good.

955
02:51:06,807 --> 02:51:10,185
Now change your wet things, man.

956
02:51:20,112 --> 02:51:25,993
We must get rid of the water.
There just has to be a way.

957
02:51:26,160 --> 02:51:30,539
Into the control-room bilge
and then outside.

958
02:51:34,418 --> 02:51:40,549
- Give it to me.
- Careful, you jerk!

959
02:51:40,716 --> 02:51:45,596
- Hoist the bucket.
- Get a move on, boys.

960
02:51:49,182 --> 02:51:52,519
Keep the rhythm going.

961
02:51:53,103 --> 02:51:57,816
Put your backs into it.

962
02:51:57,983 --> 02:52:01,903
Step on it. Quick!

963
02:52:06,491 --> 02:52:12,581
- How's it going, Chief?
- Three more. Starboard side.

964
02:52:22,799 --> 02:52:28,263
- How does it look?
- Only three to go, sir.

965
02:52:40,442 --> 02:52:43,987
Make some room for the chief.

966
02:52:59,711 --> 02:53:00,587
- More hands needed aft.
- Take the men off watch.

967
02:53:00,587 --> 02:53:05,967
- More hands needed aft.
- Take the men off watch.

968
02:53:06,593 --> 02:53:12,682
Captain ... all of our compasses
are out of action.

969
02:53:14,601 --> 02:53:19,564
We've lost the sounding gear.
All radio contact is dead.

970
02:53:22,192 --> 02:53:28,448
- First-rate condition.
- Can we get up again?

971
02:53:34,037 --> 02:53:37,916
Do you think we have a chance, sir?

972
02:53:42,754 --> 02:53:46,257
Good question.

973
02:53:50,512 --> 02:53:56,810
A bit of air must still be in
the ballast tanks from the blowing.

974
02:53:58,978 --> 02:54:06,736
That should help us. We'll use all
the high-pressure air we have left.

975
02:54:09,114 --> 02:54:12,784
We'll try.

976
02:54:14,953 --> 02:54:23,211
The boat has to be lighter.
We've got to get the water out.

977
02:54:28,174 --> 02:54:31,928
It must work!

978
02:54:32,637 --> 02:54:36,266
Come with me aft.

979
02:54:42,480 --> 02:54:50,071
The ballast pump and the compressed
air could just force the water out.

980
02:54:50,238 --> 02:54:55,952
- The ballast pump?
- We're fixing it.

981
02:54:58,204 --> 02:55:05,002
We gamble on one count.
One blast and we ...

982
02:55:05,169 --> 02:55:10,717
- There won't be a second chance.
- When?

983
02:55:10,883 --> 02:55:16,389
When the repairs are completed.
ln about eight hours, sir.

984
02:55:16,556 --> 02:55:20,935
- CO2 content?
- 1.8%.

985
02:55:21,102 --> 02:55:25,648
- Will the oxygen last?
- No.

986
02:55:27,817 --> 02:55:34,907
Emergency issue.
All men not working turn in.

987
02:56:44,769 --> 02:56:50,316
- Will he pull through?
- It's difficult to say.

988
02:57:07,041 --> 02:57:10,836
He doesn't look too good.

989
02:57:48,749 --> 02:57:53,003
Well, Pilgrim ...
is everything okay?

990
02:57:53,170 --> 02:57:57,424
We're getting it under control.
I think we're winning.

991
02:58:01,011 --> 02:58:07,059
- How is it looking aft?
- We've done what we can, sir.

992
02:58:08,310 --> 02:58:12,022
I guess it's time
I looked things over.

993
02:58:44,388 --> 02:58:47,557
You should be careful.

994
02:59:09,121 --> 02:59:13,792
- Can you make it?
- We'll make it.

995
02:59:15,335 --> 02:59:22,134
- How does it look?
- We'll soon be running.

996
02:59:30,058 --> 02:59:37,148
- How's it going?
- Two bearings to be changed.

997
03:00:32,245 --> 03:00:36,207
Chief ...

998
03:00:42,505 --> 03:00:46,634
Do you want some glucose?

999
03:00:48,595 --> 03:00:51,806
How about some apple juice?

1000
03:01:25,381 --> 03:01:31,304
They were crazy,
ordering us through the strait.

1001
03:01:31,471 --> 03:01:34,974
It was going to go wrong ...

1002
03:01:39,354 --> 03:01:42,899
He knew it.

1003
03:01:43,066 --> 03:01:46,611
The old man, he knew it.

1004
03:01:50,698 --> 03:01:57,914
From the moment that radio signal
came through, he realized the risk.

1005
03:02:00,750 --> 03:02:07,089
That's the reason
he ordered us ashore.

1006
03:02:11,427 --> 03:02:15,181
He knew there was very little hope.

1007
03:02:30,446 --> 03:02:37,370
He tried to fool us.
"An easy trick," he said.

1008
03:02:41,040 --> 03:02:45,419
"Dive and drift with the current."

1009
03:02:49,632 --> 03:02:54,011
What a clever trick.

1010
03:02:54,637 --> 03:02:58,933
But it has to work.

1011
03:03:04,313 --> 03:03:07,983
Will we ever get out of this?

1012
03:03:16,784 --> 03:03:20,412
I really don't know.

1013
03:04:08,377 --> 03:04:14,800
- I'm sorry.
- You think it's hopeless now?

1014
03:04:17,886 --> 03:04:21,849
It's been 15 hours.

1015
03:04:28,689 --> 03:04:32,359
We'll never do it.

1016
03:04:53,172 --> 03:04:55,507
I'm sorry.

1017
03:05:03,682 --> 03:05:08,020
They made us all dream
for this day.

1018
03:05:12,149 --> 03:05:16,486
To be fearless and proud and alone.

1019
03:05:17,404 --> 03:05:23,243
They told us it would be
the test of our manhood.

1020
03:05:23,410 --> 03:05:31,710
To need no one and sacrific all
for the fatherland and courage.

1021
03:05:35,380 --> 03:05:39,134
Is that not the way
they said it all?

1022
03:05:42,095 --> 03:05:48,185
I just want someone to be with.

1023
03:05:53,440 --> 03:05:57,819
The only thing I feel is afraid.

1024
03:06:47,243 --> 03:06:50,705
Situation report, sir.

1025
03:06:54,542 --> 03:06:59,339
The boat is in order.
The pump is clear.

1026
03:07:00,715 --> 03:07:07,889
Water in the trimming tanks can
be blown out with compressed air.

1027
03:07:08,890 --> 03:07:14,521
The compass is in order.
Echo sounder clear.

1028
03:07:15,271 --> 03:07:19,400
Maybe we'll be okay.

1029
03:07:29,869 --> 03:07:33,706
Good, Chief.

1030
03:07:36,376 --> 03:07:39,337
Good.

1031
03:07:47,595 --> 03:07:50,807
Go and take a rest now.

1032
03:07:57,480 --> 03:08:01,150
Just a few small problems left, sir.

1033
03:08:46,696 --> 03:08:54,996
You have to have good men.
Good men, all of them.

1034
03:08:59,041 --> 03:09:01,961
Now listen ...

1035
03:09:02,128 --> 03:09:09,427
We're going to blow out the water
and try to get out of the sand.

1036
03:09:11,721 --> 03:09:18,811
If we make it to the surface,
it could still get pretty rough.

1037
03:09:19,937 --> 03:09:23,482
The traffic's heavy up there.

1038
03:09:27,111 --> 03:09:33,159
Pray the engines start
so we can get out of this mess.

1039
03:09:34,076 --> 03:09:41,542
With the condition the boat is in
we'll head straight for La Rochelle.

1040
03:09:43,711 --> 03:09:48,716
If we make it,
it's half a bottle of beer for each.

1041
03:09:53,095 --> 03:09:57,224
There's one thing on our side ...

1042
03:09:58,392 --> 03:10:02,104
They won't be expecting us.

1043
03:10:08,152 --> 03:10:11,280
Well, men ...

1044
03:10:12,239 --> 03:10:16,577
- All set?
- Aye-aye, sir.

1045
03:10:18,996 --> 03:10:23,000
- Surface contacts?
- Nothing near, Captain.

1046
03:10:23,167 --> 03:10:28,797
Get ready to surface.
Stand by escape gear. Red light on.

1047
03:10:29,715 --> 03:10:32,885
Battle stations.

1048
03:10:56,575 --> 03:11:00,662
- Let her blow.
- Blow all tanks.

1049
03:12:13,694 --> 03:12:16,613
She's rising.

1050
03:12:17,531 --> 03:12:21,785
- Easy.
- Starboard planes down 15.

1051
03:12:30,419 --> 03:12:36,758
- 270 metres!
- First watch, stand by.

1052
03:12:36,925 --> 03:12:39,761
260 metres.

1053
03:12:45,392 --> 03:12:48,478
250 metres.

1054
03:12:56,111 --> 03:12:59,114
240 metres.

1055
03:13:03,952 --> 03:13:06,997
230 metres.

1056
03:13:11,585 --> 03:13:14,379
220.

1057
03:14:09,267 --> 03:14:11,769
Start up engines?

1058
03:14:16,232 --> 03:14:21,696
- Go ahead. Both main engines.
- This is it, boys.

1059
03:14:30,413 --> 03:14:33,833
Yeah.

1060
03:14:47,930 --> 03:14:50,808
They're going!

1061
03:14:50,975 --> 03:14:55,855
I've never heard such sweet music
in all my life.

1062
03:14:58,566 --> 03:15:01,694
They're running!

1063
03:15:16,083 --> 03:15:19,879
They won't catch us this time.
Not this time!

1064
03:15:23,382 --> 03:15:28,721
Keep going and get us back.
That's an order!

1065
03:15:28,888 --> 03:15:32,683
Right full rudder.
Come to 320.

1066
03:15:32,850 --> 03:15:35,728
Jesus that's good!

1067
03:15:40,066 --> 03:15:46,197
They haven't spotted us.
They're snoring in their bunks.

1068
03:15:49,742 --> 03:15:55,539
They're drinking in the bar.
Celebrating our sinking!

1069
03:15:58,334 --> 03:16:02,171
Not yet, my friends!

1070
03:16:41,544 --> 03:16:46,924
- Boys, here's to home!
- And an end to the war.

1071
03:17:21,792 --> 03:17:25,337
Let's pray the engines hold out.

1072
03:17:27,715 --> 03:17:32,678
With a bit of luck ...

1073
03:17:35,222 --> 03:17:38,976
... we'll make it back home.

1074
03:17:42,855 --> 03:17:45,733
Third U-boat flotilla
welcome back home. Three cheers.

1075
03:17:45,733 --> 03:17:49,445
Third U-boat flotilla
welcome back home. Three cheers.

1076
03:18:20,392 --> 03:18:23,854
Both engines stop.
Stern line out.

1077
03:18:49,796 --> 03:18:56,428
- Thank you, Hinrich.
- It's okay. The sun is shining.

1078
03:18:57,429 --> 03:19:01,099
Another two metres.

1079
03:19:02,434 --> 03:19:05,520
Okay, we have it.

1080
03:19:12,110 --> 03:19:16,114
- Nearly there.
- Wounded man coming ashore.

1081
03:20:44,744 --> 03:20:47,831
Get under cover!

1082
03:21:21,656 --> 03:21:26,995
- Bring a medic!
- Over here.

1083
03:21:27,161 --> 03:21:30,957
Medic!
