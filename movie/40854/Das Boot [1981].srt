5
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,147
Our bosun's mate.

6
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,109
He's soaked to the gills.

7
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,617
The road's closed.

8
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:22,951
Who are those pigs?

9
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,707
The road's clear.
Coming through!

10
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,968
That's their fireboat drill.

11
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,471
They're all boys off our boat.

12
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,205
Captain.

13
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,673
Merkel's guys.
They ship out tomorrow too.

14
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:32,354
Okay, sailors!
Let's go set that cathouse on fire!

15
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,773
Just don't miss your mark!

16
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,235
Stuff some season's greetings
in there!

17
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,279
Scared fuckers.

18
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,031
They need sex
like the infantry needs alcohol.

19
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,868
What's going on here?

20
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,870
Good luck!

21
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,880
Captain!

22
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,383
My 2nd officer.

23
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,764
This is Lieutenant Werner,
naval war correspondent.

24
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,434
He'll ship out with us.

25
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,064
He'll report anything of interest.

26
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,735
Welcome aboard, lieutenant.

27
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,570
Good evening.

28
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,077
This way, lieutenant.

29
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,580
U-boat crews need relaxation.

30
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,749
Good evening.

31
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:34,916
Two beers.

32
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,128
Yes, captain.

33
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,102
Where's Thomsen?

34
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,855
Doesn't he want
to celebrate his medal?

35
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,154
Any news from your wife?

36
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,495
No personal calls allowed
till after 10 p.m.

37
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,125
Two beers.

38
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,054
Reporting back from U-96.

39
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,557
Munitions and provisions aboard,
ready to put to sea.

40
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,142
Thanks, 1st.

41
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,061
Something else, captain.

42
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,482
On my way here,

43
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,692
some of the crew harassed me.

44
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,823
They actually...

45
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,493
An incredible incident...

46
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,829
They...

47
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,914
They pissed on you.

48
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,334
Yes.

49
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,670
Me too.

50
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,176
Just a minute!

51
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:12,222
Attention, please!

52
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,016
Let's give
our newly decorated officer,

53
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,393
Captain Thomsen,

54
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,061
three cheers!

55
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,075
That's Thomsen for you.

56
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,411
One of the old guard.

57
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,745
Always drunk now.

58
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,637
My respects, Thomsen!

59
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,897
Quiet in this whorehouse!

60
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,074
A toast to our wonderful,

61
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,410
abstaining,

62
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,330
womanless Führer.

63
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:23,084
Who rose gloriously

64
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,420
from apprentice painter

65
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,590
to become the world's
greatest battle strategist.

66
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,636
What? Isn't it true?

67
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,098
He's the great naval expert,

68
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,810
who took it upon himself,

69
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,605
in his wisdom...

70
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,783
How's it go again?

71
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,498
Who's been showing
that English bedwetter,

72
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,502
that cigar-chomping
asshole Churchill,

73
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,297
where to go stick

74
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,717
his cigars!

75
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,218
Sorry.

76
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,389
See you tomorrow.
I've got a call to make.

77
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,615
It's not like the old gang.

78
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,038
These are so green and eager.

79
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,625
Wet behind the ears.

80
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,085
Braggarts.

81
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,383
Cheeks together, balls in their hands,

82
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,638
and belief
in the Führer in their eyes.

83
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,726
They'll calm down soon enough.

84
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,129
You're a pig's ass!

85
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:40,115
Fight! Win! Or Die!

86
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,966
Come on, Phillip, get up!

87
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,468
Help me here!

88
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,894
I wanted to

89
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,563
really

90
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,649
screw my brains out...

91
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,235
I am not in the condition to fuck.

92
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,820
It's all right.

93
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,587
That's Thomsen's boat.

94
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,839
Equipment checks okay?

95
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,176
The starboard propeller had
a bent blade.

96
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,930
That's what caused whining
on silent runs.

97
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,768
We have a brand-new propeller
now, captain.

98
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:24,761
Our boat.

99
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,055
Crew at attention!

100
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:33,228
Captain's revue, eyes left.

101
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,739
Crew reporting for duty.

102
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,075
All decks ready to sail.

103
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,577
Thank you, 1st officer.

104
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,752
At ease!

105
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,272
Well, men...

106
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,526
Everything okay?

107
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,279
Yes, captain!

108
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,783
We have a guest.

109
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,871
Lieutenant Werner.

110
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,956
Naval correspondent.

111
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,295
He wants to look around,

112
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,847
to watch respectable German heroes.

113
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,725
Act accordingly.

114
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,812
Man your stations.

115
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:51,032
Hail and victory and sink them all!

116
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,980
Pick up those vegetables.
This is no grocery store!

117
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,898
Command post.

118
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,818
Torpedo workshop and storage.

119
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,070
Shape up and your mugs
will make the newspaper!

120
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,074
Thank you, gentlemen.
Follow me.

121
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,742
This is our shit house.
Uh-huh.

122
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,744
One hole for fifty men.
Oh.

123
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,080
The other's full of provisions.

124
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,125
More space for food
than for shit. Some logic.

125
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,336
Chief petty officer's.
Uh-huh.

126
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,255
My home, so to speak.

127
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,340
Here's the officers' mess.

128
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,093
Don't stow stuff that way!

129
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,472
It's nice in here.

130
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,765
Where are you?

131
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,934
Sorry, coming. May I?

132
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,187
Careful!

133
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,442
Here's the radio room.
Over here, the control room.

134
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,651
Just what we need.

135
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,361
The control room.

136
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,114
The boat's command center.

137
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,536
This leads to quarters.

138
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,542
Gotta move this stuff.

139
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,795
Morning, lieutenant.

140
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,632
Petty officers sleep here.

141
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,342
Twelve men.

142
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,971
Two men share most bunks,
depending on their duties.

143
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,975
If one's on guard, the next one sleeps
in the other's stink. Right?

144
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,480
This is your bunk.

145
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,066
Just for you, our guest.

146
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,193
That's for you too.

147
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,987
Your oxygen mask.
Very important!

148
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,365
Not much good except in calm seas.

149
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,534
It comes in handy
when the diesel reeks.

150
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,163
Or when Frenssen farts.

151
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,707
Come along.

152
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,834
Coming through!

153
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,587
This is the galley.

154
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,048
And this is Johann, the ghost.

155
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,348
Hey, Johann, everything greased up?

156
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,393
Man on bridge?

157
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,545
Take photos of the crew returning,

158
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,547
not putting out to sea.

159
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,382
Why?

160
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,554
They'll have beards by then.

161
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:14,402
It would shame the Brits
to see mere boys give them hell.

162
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,572
Baby faces,

163
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,742
who should still suck Mama's breast.

164
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,584
I feel ancient around these kids.

165
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,673
Like I'm on some Children's Crusade.

166
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,102
Permission to pass?

167
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,384
You're from Mexico?

168
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,137
Yes, south of Mexico City.

169
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,473
Nice?

170
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,683
Yes, sir.

171
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,811
Great climate,
due to the high altitude.

172
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,492
You came a long way.

173
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,995
As a German,
it was a matter of course.

174
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,334
What did you do there?

175
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,213
I worked on my step-parents'
plantation.

176
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,592
The boss' son?

177
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,844
You could put it that way.

178
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,223
Stand by, first
watch and engine watch.

179
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,517
Excuse me.

180
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,021
Permission to pass?

181
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,534
Reporting to bridge watch.
Mm.

182
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,544
Rigid jawbones, our 1st officer.

183
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,924
He'll march anywhere.

184
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,386
A model of ideology.

185
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,222
He's so tense,
he could crack nuts with his ass.

186
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,231
Watch out. Eggs.

187
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,945
- Man on bridge?
- Yes.

188
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,073
Alarm!

189
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,589
All hands forward!

190
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,507
Come on, let's go!

191
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,092
Wake up, you guys!

192
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,929
Move that body.
Hop, hop! Let's go!

193
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,521
I'll kick your asses till they bleed!

194
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,858
That's an alarm, damn it!

195
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,693
This ain't a cruise ship!

196
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,298
Blow main dive tank.

197
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,012
Stern to 10.

198
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,984
April Fools.

199
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,861
Exercise is good for you.

200
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,072
Can't let no moss grow.

201
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,448
Practice drill.

202
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,078
Steady as she goes.

203
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,081
Bow up 15. Stern up 10.

204
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,084
Both up.

205
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,174
Boat trimmed.
Close main vents.

206
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,179
Vents closed.

207
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,265
Deeper, chief.

208
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,934
Let's see if these valves are tight.

209
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,021
Bow down 15, stern up 10.

210
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,616
The shipyard rates it to 90 meters.

211
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:17,580
But we can go deeper.

212
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:31,802
Of course, there's a limit.

213
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,556
We can only take so much pressure,

214
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:40,311
before the boat's crushed.

215
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,158
Secure upper hatches.

216
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,920
It's water pressure.
Yes, of course.

217
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,305
Deeper.

218
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,935
140 meters.

219
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,527
It's gotta take it.

220
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,028
150.

221
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,870
160 meters.

222
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,670
That's all today.

223
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,381
Surface.

224
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,550
Bow up 10. Stern up 5.

225
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:37,886
Your girl?

226
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,602
French?

227
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,531
You know that florist next
to the Cafe A l'Ami Pierrot?

228
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,034
Where?

229
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,036
A l'Ami Pierrot.

230
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,204
Yeah, sure,

231
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,873
the two salesgirls,

232
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,584
Jeannette and...
What's her name?

233
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,045
Francoise.

234
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:15,716
We're engaged.

235
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,596
Secretly, of course.

236
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,063
May I?

237
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,237
Really very pretty.

238
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,827
What's wrong?

239
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,250
She's pregnant.

240
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,464
But,

241
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,426
you know what that means.

242
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,596
Once the Partisans find out,

243
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:03,931
her kid's half-German...

244
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,267
What can I do?

245
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,270
She definitely wants it.

246
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,279
You've got a problem.

247
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:12,207
Those guys in Berlin got nothing
but insults for Churchill.

248
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,919
How's it go again?

249
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,259
"Drunkard."

250
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,345
"Guzzler."

251
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,016
"Paralytic."

252
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:34,730
He's sending a lot of heat our way
for a paralyzed drunk.

253
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,274
Nonetheless,

254
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,568
we'll force him to his knees.

255
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,445
That is my firm belief.

256
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,867
Listen, smart guy,

257
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:52,039
he's far from being on his knees.

258
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,377
Wonder how many ships get through.

259
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:02,382
Especially now, while we're staring
at the walls and waiting.

260
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,553
Where are our planes and scouts,
Herr Göring?

261
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,097
The enemy's got plenty.

262
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:15,062
Hot air, that's all that comes out
of that fat slob.

263
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:23,237
Braggarts, nothing but braggarts.

264
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,738
All of them.

265
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,956
Go on,

266
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,667
take it down.

267
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,835
Notes,

268
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,087
for your "Heroes' Epic"

269
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,259
and the propaganda machine.

270
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,680
Where's the music?

271
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,852
Our Hitler Youth leader here
could play us a record.

272
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,941
That "Tipperary" song, if you please!

273
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,959
Hey, now we're the Royal Navy.

274
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,805
This record won't hurt

275
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,724
your ideological edifice.

276
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:53,243
Shut that bulkhead, you cockroach!

277
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,663
What an asshole.

278
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,249
We should've used him for ballast.

279
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,171
One day I'll rip
his ass up to his ears

280
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,882
till he can watch himself
through his own asshole.

281
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,512
Morning.

282
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,185
This stinks.

283
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,689
It's sweaty socks and hair grease,

284
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,441
Pilgrim's special mix.

285
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,453
Tastes like shit, eh?

286
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,705
Those scrambled eggs,

287
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,293
taste like baby poo-poo.

288
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,215
Wanna raise chickens on the boat?

289
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:52,302
And ducks in the bilge.
Tiny ones.

290
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,431
We could feed them green boogers.

291
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,892
You pig's ass.
But why?

292
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,228
They'd love some.

293
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,563
Every morning,

294
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,816
fat, fresh boogers.

295
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,601
"Personal hygiene," four letters?

296
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,438
Bath.

297
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,110
Thanks.

298
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,537
"Innermost affection," four letters?

299
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,791
Love.

300
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,169
Exactly.

301
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,390
Not too intellectual around here.

302
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,818
Your radiogram, captain.

303
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,164
Hold on.

304
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,402
This could work.

305
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,791
A new course?

306
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,381
Wait and see.

307
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,138
May I see the radiogram?

308
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:52,065
"Convoy reported, coordinates AK 22,

309
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,943
general course about 60 degrees

310
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,737
at 8 nautical miles."
From U-37.

311
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:01,616
U-37 is Marten's boat.
He's after a convoy.

312
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,918
Too far away. Can't make it.

313
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,756
Damn this waiting!

314
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,259
Will we ever see some action?

315
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,102
Move it, you turtle!

316
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,188
Let's hear your bones crack!

317
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,441
Pull them out of the cozy Lady.

318
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,610
Pretty big johnnies, huh?

319
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,362
Move it, lazybones!
The press!

320
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,282
Let me get that. Hold it. Very nice.

321
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,659
Greased up nice with Vaseline,

322
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,953
and rammed back into the Lady.

323
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,955
Don't let me get in your way.

324
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,291
One more! Good.

325
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,629
And another.

326
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:06,514
A bit to the left.
Maybe a profile shot.

327
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:09,392
Another pose, a little to the...

328
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,697
Who did that?

329
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,545
Tell me,

330
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,465
you got hairs in your nose?

331
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:24,843
Why?

332
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,762
Because I've got some in my ass.

333
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,308
We can tie them together.

334
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,444
Francoise, my love,

335
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:46,573
this is my 14th letter,
but you've yet to see one.

336
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,837
20th day at sea.

337
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:05,425
Feeling foggy and overfed.
It's all so crazy.

338
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:06,676
Alarm!

339
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,180
All ahead full!

340
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,309
Flood tanks!

341
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,022
I saw a shadow off starboard
through the rain.

342
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,274
Take her down to 30 meters.

343
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,444
Stern up slowly, bow down 10.

344
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,325
Anything off starboard?

345
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:31,785
Propeller sounds.

346
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,714
110 degrees.

347
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,555
Way aft of us.

348
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,818
Contact getting fainter.

349
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,828
Fading fast.

350
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,174
We'll stay under.

351
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,010
Steer 120 degrees.

352
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,269
That's a fast, lone ship.

353
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,188
We've got no chance in the dark.

354
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:09,799
"Attention to personal hygiene
and dress are not just appearances.

355
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:13,094
It reflects an upright,
clean interior,

356
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:16,097
thus influencing the surroundings.

357
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:19,225
The true officer is unpretentious,

358
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:22,312
in character and wardrobe,

359
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,899
which was not always the case,

360
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:29,068
when superiors were more lenient,

361
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:33,239
because a German lieutenant
always knew how to die."

362
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,326
Comfy place, huh?

363
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,079
No mail, no phones.

364
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,167
A well-ventilated boat.

365
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,086
Attractive wood paneling.

366
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,259
Free home cooking.

367
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,970
We're sitting in clover.

368
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,599
Like horse droppings.

369
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,521
It sits in clover too.

370
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,690
It doesn't worry about anything,

371
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,026
and it gets to let off steam.

372
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,510
U-boat special cocktail.

373
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:37,971
Envious?

374
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,317
Turn it off!

375
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:14,674
These latest radiograms...

376
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:20,013
"Dived avoiding aircraft."

377
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,391
"Dived avoiding destroyer
depth charges."

378
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,737
Those Brits
don't make mistakes anymore.

379
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,706
Watch fuel flow!

380
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,416
Okay.

381
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,299
Let's get to the diesel room!

382
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,235
Watch out!

383
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,404
Tough times, huh?
What's up?

384
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,323
U-32, Berthold's boat,

385
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,910
discovered a convoy.
We'll be there in 10 hours.

386
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,002
Listen up.

387
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:37,090
We're in pursuit
of a convoy tracked by U-32.

388
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:40,426
Expect contact at 1800 hours.

389
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,097
I hope we blast off some eels.

390
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,807
It'll clear some space!

391
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,602
More than 30 freighters!

392
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,148
Berthold better not attack now.

393
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:57,110
Ought to stay close
until the other boats arrive.

394
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:03,491
There is nothing more beautiful
than a submarine,

395
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,451
and a sailboat.

396
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:08,788
There are no better lines
than those of a sailboat.

397
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:11,290
I sailed on
a 3-masted schooner once.

398
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,209
Gorgeous ship.

399
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,294
It had holds the size of a cathedral!

400
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,180
That burns some fuel, huh?

401
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,016
Asshole.

402
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:38,401
Shitty fog, damn it!

403
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:49,036
Watch out or else we'll sail
right by them.

404
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:53,166
Should have made contact by now.

405
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,835
Why's there no signal from Berthold?

406
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,007
Why no word from headquarters?

407
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:09,432
Visibility nil, captain.
It's useless!

408
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,316
Prepare to take her down!

409
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,405
Get below!

410
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,114
Take her down to 30 meters.

411
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:09,075
Bow up 10.

412
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,244
Stern down 5.

413
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,247
Bow zero.

414
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,249
Stern zero.

415
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:21,754
What's happening?
Why are we diving?

416
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,758
Hydrophone check.

417
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:30,930
You hear more down here
than you can see up there.

418
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,471
No contact, nothing?

419
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,569
Nothing at all?

420
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:26,045
Contact, bearing 60 degrees.
Quite faint.

421
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,062
Depth charges.

422
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,110
They're blasting someone.

423
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,911
What's their exact bearing now?

424
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,586
Forty-five degrees, moving right.

425
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,923
Moving away.

426
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,432
Surface!

427
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,434
Steer 330 degrees.

428
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:26,439
Entry for your log book.

429
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:29,442
Commenced operation despite weather.

430
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,977
Damn this weather!

431
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,313
What's it look like?

432
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,981
Just a moment.

433
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:14,820
Enemy's position here,
if they haven't zig-zagged.

434
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:19,575
Vessel! Starboard ahead!

435
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,501
Forty degrees, over that way!

436
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:31,545
See it.

437
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,844
That's no freighter.

438
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,933
That's a damn destroyer.

439
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,393
Approaching.

440
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:48,938
Get below.

441
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:56,654
Flood tanks!

442
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,959
Periscope depth.

443
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:14,732
Stand by battle stations.

444
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,824
Move!

445
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,038
Go! Go! Faster!

446
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,882
Watch out, chief.

447
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,977
Flood tubes 1to 4.

448
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:02,071
He wants to attack the destroyer.
That's madness in this weather.

449
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,367
Watch our depth!

450
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:08,869
Bow up 2.

451
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,038
Stern down 2.

452
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:15,834
Gently.

453
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,505
Bow average,

454
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,423
13.5 meters.

455
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,514
Open torpedo hatches.

456
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,239
12.

457
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,075
30.

458
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,703
6,000.

459
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:52,871
2.

460
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:58,877
40.
Spread shots from tubes 1 and 3.

461
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,379
3 degrees.

462
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:07,720
Tubes 1 to 4 ready to fire.

463
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,954
Damn.

464
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,476
Close hatches! Dive fast!

465
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,152
Depth charges!

466
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,294
Quick, get fuses!

467
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:25,714
Check outboard valves.

468
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,317
Control room secured.

469
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,153
All clear forward.

470
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,326
No serious damages.

471
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:03,001
They actually spotted our periscope.

472
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,341
Hard to believe in this heavy sea.

473
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,371
Getting any louder?

474
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:43,876
The same. Ahead of us.

475
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:15,991
It's pulling further ahead.
295 degrees.

476
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,201
Left full rudder.

477
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:24,291
Rudder is left full.

478
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,460
Steer due north.

479
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:28,629
Deeper.

480
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:31,507
Bow down 15. Stern up 10.

481
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,675
Pump 200 liters forward.

482
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,940
All ahead one-third.

483
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,823
Now it all turns psychological,
gentlemen.

484
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:40,409
Check torpedo tubes!

485
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:59,761
Stay calm, men.

486
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,930
That ain't nothing yet.

487
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:15,902
Kill the lights.

488
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,412
Silent run.

489
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:28,498
Both engines 50 r.p.m.

490
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,810
Contact closing.

491
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,730
Ahead, 52 degrees.

492
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:54,149
Approaching fast.

493
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,567
Midships.

494
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,570
All full ahead. Right full rudder.

495
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:25,138
Heading straight for us!

496
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:39,069
Those aren't amateurs
up there. Deeper!

497
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:40,237
Bow down 20.

498
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:42,364
Stern up 5.

499
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:19,276
Destroyer approaching.
Getting louder.

500
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,570
Deeper, quickly.

501
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,507
Don't worry.

502
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:44,885
It's just creaking.

503
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:54,853
Deeper.

504
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,563
Stern up 15.

505
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:32,933
Tighten that flange!

506
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,479
Higher! To 150 meters!

507
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:40,482
Hurry! Bow up 20!

508
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:44,528
Come on, tighter! Yaah!

509
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:48,532
Push already! Do it, do it!

510
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,181
Hull valves secured.

511
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:14,933
Both level.

512
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:22,107
Boat trimmed at 150 meters.

513
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,746
Getting closer.

514
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:37,914
New approach.

515
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:52,304
Come on, come on.

516
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,157
They're above us.

517
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:17,287
Directly above us.

518
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:46,358
Contact fading to starboard.

519
01:05:57,912 --> 01:05:59,454
Twenty-two.

520
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,464
Twenty-three.

521
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:11,883
Far away.

522
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,143
Fading aft.

523
01:06:31,278 --> 01:06:32,487
Barely audible.

524
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,804
No more contact.

525
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:12,235
That's the end of that.

526
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:19,200
Silent run.

527
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:22,662
Both engines, 50 r.p.m.

528
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:58,323
From my private collection.

529
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:14,923
Engine room damages?

530
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,925
A lot of smashed stuff.

531
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,261
Can you fix it?
It's in the works.

532
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:23,973
Make sure it's done right.

533
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:27,143
I've got a hunch we're going
to see action.

534
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,427
It's been almost an hour.

535
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:05,056
We got rid of them, captain.

536
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,225
We'll see.

537
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:11,729
Maybe they're just lying
in wait for us,

538
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:15,567
until we feel safe enough to surface.

539
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:20,822
These guys aren't stupid.

540
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,783
Continue silent run.
We'll surface at dark.

541
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:27,245
Then we'll see.

542
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,083
She's coming up fast.

543
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:17,170
Hydrophone check at 30 meters.

544
01:10:20,507 --> 01:10:22,342
She's at 30 meters.

545
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,028
Periscope depth.

546
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:49,494
Periscope clear.

547
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:52,163
Stern down 5.

548
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:54,332
Coming up.

549
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,501
Stern up 3.

550
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,212
Zero.

551
01:11:15,062 --> 01:11:16,229
Surface.

552
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:17,689
Blow tanks.

553
01:11:40,045 --> 01:11:42,255
What a cutie pie.

554
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:44,882
If Mama could see you now.

555
01:12:12,619 --> 01:12:15,246
Quiet in this whorehouse!

556
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:24,922
Bad news, guys.

557
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,633
What's going on?

558
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:32,096
Soccer. Schalke.

559
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,643
We lost, 5-0.

560
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:44,317
No chance to make the semi-finals.

561
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:48,279
I can't believe this shit!

562
01:12:58,123 --> 01:12:59,624
Drop them.

563
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:24,232
You pig.

564
01:13:24,858 --> 01:13:26,651
Crabs.

565
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:29,612
A whole army of crabs.

566
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:32,198
They'll eat little guys
like you to the bone.

567
01:13:37,454 --> 01:13:41,040
Give that hussy some puffy!

568
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,756
Permission to pass?

569
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,825
Ought to shave this pig, huh?

570
01:14:21,498 --> 01:14:24,333
What's that in your eyebrows?

571
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,004
Pardon?

572
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:31,215
You'd better see the medic.

573
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:33,342
You've got the crabs.

574
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:43,394
Are you joking?

575
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:47,064
Once they crawl up there,
it's really far gone.

576
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:08,586
Number One.

577
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:10,296
Lieutenant?

578
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:11,839
Where's the medic?

579
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,550
In the bow.

580
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:22,600
This can't be true!

581
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,831
Watch your sector.

582
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:49,293
What?

583
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:51,379
Pull yourself together!

584
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:55,466
Have you gone crazy?

585
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:03,766
Have you heard?

586
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:05,309
Dufte is engaged.

587
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:08,646
Poor woman!

588
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,106
Asshole!

589
01:16:10,315 --> 01:16:12,358
I thought he only jerks off.

590
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:16,696
Yeah, breed him
with a chimp at the zoo.

591
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:20,575
Here are photos of his lady.

592
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:21,909
Give them back!

593
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:29,083
I can't believe it.

594
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:30,876
You screw this bag?

595
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:12,918
This boat can take it.

596
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:18,382
You should be
in a storm on a schooner.

597
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:21,886
You don't feel a thing down here.

598
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:35,316
Compass.

599
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:49,538
The boat's heaving to starboard.

600
01:17:49,706 --> 01:17:51,749
I can barely keep her on course.

601
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:54,835
Don't worry about it.

602
01:17:59,883 --> 01:18:01,676
We're hardly moving.

603
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:04,762
We're just burning fuel.

604
01:18:12,979 --> 01:18:14,855
Prepare to dive.

605
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:17,483
Diving stations!

606
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,735
Flooding tanks.

607
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:21,737
All main vents clear.

608
01:19:21,381 --> 01:19:23,966
No tales of victory, huh?

609
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:30,931
Just some position reports.

610
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,643
SOS calls from far-off boats.

611
01:19:38,648 --> 01:19:42,151
If anyone breaks a rudder
in this weather,

612
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:48,866
they better start praying.

613
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:56,749
The sea can't drown us, though.

614
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:01,462
There's no ship as seaworthy as ours.

615
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:17,978
Play that record.

616
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:21,816
You know which one.

617
01:21:34,764 --> 01:21:37,141
Watch out!

618
01:21:55,827 --> 01:21:58,412
Man overboard!

619
01:22:23,146 --> 01:22:24,480
Hold on!

620
01:22:42,248 --> 01:22:45,960
Move! Hold onto him!

621
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:48,712
Put him on the chart box!

622
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,223
Get the medic case!

623
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:00,975
Damn it!

624
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:03,394
The medic case, damn it!

625
01:23:03,561 --> 01:23:05,104
Prepare to dive!

626
01:23:13,738 --> 01:23:18,033
"A military leader leads
through self-discipline.

627
01:23:18,201 --> 01:23:21,954
Without his example,
education is impossible."

628
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:25,582
Three broken ribs, one open wound.

629
01:23:26,876 --> 01:23:28,377
Could be worse.

630
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:33,799
Shitty month.

631
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:38,679
Real shitty.

632
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:41,598
Mildew is good for you.

633
01:23:45,645 --> 01:23:47,938
It's the next best thing

634
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:51,150
to fresh lettuce.

635
01:23:54,612 --> 01:23:58,490
Let's be grateful
for anything that grows here.

636
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:09,918
They'll have snow back home now.

637
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,261
Funny.

638
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:25,350
I haven't seen snow in years.

639
01:24:28,938 --> 01:24:29,980
May I?

640
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:31,440
By all means.

641
01:24:45,705 --> 01:24:47,164
Your wife?

642
01:25:54,524 --> 01:25:57,651
Over there, ahead!

643
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:06,118
Captain, U-boat, port ahead!

644
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:10,747
German boat, German U-boat!

645
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:17,671
Bearing 350 degrees.
Almost straight ahead!

646
01:26:25,471 --> 01:26:27,222
God, you're right!

647
01:26:28,808 --> 01:26:30,976
All engines stop.
Get that signal lamp up!

648
01:27:05,136 --> 01:27:06,720
That's Thomsen!

649
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:11,141
All back half.

650
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,787
Happy hunting, you old sea dog!

651
01:27:42,382 --> 01:27:44,091
Phillip, my friend.

652
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:47,594
So they kicked you out here again.

653
01:27:55,228 --> 01:27:57,813
God damn mess!

654
01:28:02,026 --> 01:28:04,319
Only 12 boats in the Atlantic.

655
01:28:04,487 --> 01:28:08,031
From Greenland to the Azores,
a lousy dozen!

656
01:28:09,033 --> 01:28:12,953
And here we are,
almost ramming into each other.

657
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:17,165
Sixty meters. Boat is trimmed.

658
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:24,381
Something's wrong here.

659
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:29,761
Our position's correct?

660
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,139
More or less, captain.

661
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:35,017
What's that supposed to mean?

662
01:28:35,935 --> 01:28:38,562
Not one sun shot in two weeks.

663
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:41,231
And we've drifted in this storm.

664
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:44,359
Hard to calculate.

665
01:28:53,077 --> 01:28:54,870
That's just great.

666
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:58,790
All of us "more or less" in position,

667
01:28:58,958 --> 01:29:00,709
and it'll happen.

668
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:05,213
Two boats in one place
and gaping holes in the route.

669
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:09,384
The British can slide
a whole fleet through.

670
01:29:17,852 --> 01:29:21,646
Here in the middle of the sea,
it's always another story.

671
01:29:22,982 --> 01:29:25,525
I hope you're taking notes.

672
01:29:25,693 --> 01:29:28,445
Maybe you can clue headquarters in.

673
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:30,947
Surely, you have better
connections than me.

674
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:36,870
You think so, huh?

675
01:30:04,607 --> 01:30:06,483
What's going on?

676
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:08,151
Convoy.

677
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:25,627
- Man on bridge?
- Affirmative.

678
01:31:15,219 --> 01:31:20,098
Convoy putting to sea.
Five columns.

679
01:31:20,349 --> 01:31:22,309
Real big show.

680
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:28,565
You see any escort?

681
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:29,816
Destroyers?

682
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:33,361
Nope, nothing.

683
01:31:33,529 --> 01:31:35,655
No security. Nothing.

684
01:31:40,786 --> 01:31:42,704
Strange.

685
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,335
Are they chasing one of ours
on the other side?

686
01:31:57,637 --> 01:31:59,429
Damn moonlight.

687
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:06,895
- How many of ours are here?
- Five.

688
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:12,984
Shall we risk it?

689
01:32:16,447 --> 01:32:18,406
I think so, captain.

690
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:24,246
Port to 180 degrees.

691
01:32:24,497 --> 01:32:25,664
New course,

692
01:32:25,873 --> 01:32:28,625
port to 180 degrees.

693
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:37,217
How's it feel to you, Kriechbaum?

694
01:32:40,096 --> 01:32:43,598
It will work, captain. For sure.

695
01:32:55,903 --> 01:32:58,697
Tubes 1 to 4,
prepare for surface firing.

696
01:32:58,864 --> 01:33:00,574
Flood tubes 1 to 4.

697
01:33:00,741 --> 01:33:02,200
I'll take the helm.

698
01:33:02,368 --> 01:33:04,411
Target optics to bridge.

699
01:33:25,516 --> 01:33:28,893
All ahead full, port to 107 degrees.

700
01:33:29,061 --> 01:33:30,186
Commencing attack!

701
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:36,276
Watch the oil pressure!

702
01:33:40,531 --> 01:33:42,782
Bow right, position 50.

703
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:44,409
Check.

704
01:33:44,577 --> 01:33:46,953
2,200.

705
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:50,665
Those two that overlap,

706
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:54,628
double blast the fat one,
single shots for the other.

707
01:33:55,546 --> 01:33:56,588
Tracking target.

708
01:33:56,756 --> 01:34:00,091
All ahead one-third.

709
01:34:00,259 --> 01:34:02,093
Open torpedo hatches.

710
01:34:02,345 --> 01:34:07,223
Target bearing 63.

711
01:34:07,391 --> 01:34:09,059
Sights adjusted.

712
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:11,061
Keep tracking target.

713
01:34:12,271 --> 01:34:13,313
Target acquisition.

714
01:34:13,522 --> 01:34:15,440
Tubes 1 and 2,

715
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:17,609
fire at will.

716
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:22,739
Tube 1, fire!

717
01:34:25,284 --> 01:34:26,409
Tube 2.

718
01:34:30,247 --> 01:34:31,790
Tube 3, stand by.

719
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,629
Fire!

720
01:34:39,965 --> 01:34:42,634
Tube 4 ready.

721
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,471
Fire!

722
01:34:46,847 --> 01:34:48,765
Destroyer dead ahead!

723
01:34:50,726 --> 01:34:51,976
They're firing!

724
01:34:53,062 --> 01:34:54,938
Alarm!

725
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:30,765
Bow up 10, stern up 5.

726
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:38,189
Quiet, damn it!

727
01:35:40,067 --> 01:35:41,735
Down to 80 meters.

728
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:43,862
Slowly.

729
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:48,032
Bow down 15, stern up 10.

730
01:35:52,204 --> 01:35:53,955
What's with the torpedoes?

731
01:35:54,623 --> 01:35:56,458
Wait and see.

732
01:36:02,256 --> 01:36:04,424
The party is about to start.

733
01:36:06,469 --> 01:36:08,052
Hundred ten.

734
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:17,771
Hundred twenty.

735
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:21,941
Shitty torpedoes.
Tracking is off again.

736
01:36:22,693 --> 01:36:24,944
The old man crazy, or what?

737
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:26,863
Just charges right in.

738
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:29,199
Like some speedboat attack.

739
01:36:31,243 --> 01:36:33,912
They'll rip our asses open now.

740
01:36:42,546 --> 01:36:43,713
Got that one.

741
01:36:45,716 --> 01:36:47,550
Yeah, boys, we got one!

742
01:36:49,428 --> 01:36:51,304
Quiet now!

743
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:16,663
Time's up for third torpedo.

744
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:24,963
Number three.

745
01:37:41,564 --> 01:37:42,939
Two going down.

746
01:37:57,705 --> 01:38:00,915
Their bulkheads are breaking.
They're drowning.

747
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:20,643
Here it comes,

748
01:38:25,858 --> 01:38:27,942
their revenge.

749
01:38:38,245 --> 01:38:40,413
Destroyer bearing 44 degrees.

750
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:41,831
Any movement?

751
01:38:41,999 --> 01:38:43,750
Moving left,

752
01:38:44,043 --> 01:38:45,919
fading.

753
01:38:59,808 --> 01:39:03,353
Right full rudder.
All ahead one-half.

754
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:12,862
Astern of us.

755
01:39:16,533 --> 01:39:18,284
Way astern of us.

756
01:39:23,082 --> 01:39:25,500
They're spitting at the wrong spot.

757
01:39:34,468 --> 01:39:36,719
We aren't rid of them yet.

758
01:39:39,098 --> 01:39:41,182
I guess they're a bit upset.

759
01:39:42,685 --> 01:39:44,644
Destroyer contact.

760
01:39:44,812 --> 01:39:48,064
Contact bearing 270 and closing.

761
01:39:49,233 --> 01:39:51,734
All ahead one-third.

762
01:40:04,415 --> 01:40:06,249
Here they come.

763
01:40:33,986 --> 01:40:35,278
All ahead full!

764
01:40:35,446 --> 01:40:36,904
Dump 150 liters!

765
01:41:42,346 --> 01:41:44,013
Asdic.

766
01:41:45,265 --> 01:41:48,601
Ultrasonic detection system.

767
01:41:53,565 --> 01:41:58,361
Pigs. Rotten pigs.

768
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:11,874
Damages?

769
01:42:12,042 --> 01:42:13,918
Air shaft fractured.

770
01:42:19,967 --> 01:42:24,762
Shh. Quiet. Keep quiet.

771
01:43:16,648 --> 01:43:17,648
Silent run.

772
01:43:17,816 --> 01:43:20,985
Fifty r.p.m. Shut off ventilators.

773
01:43:22,779 --> 01:43:23,946
Port 15.

774
01:43:44,843 --> 01:43:45,843
All ahead full!

775
01:43:55,812 --> 01:43:57,647
Shut it off!

776
01:44:13,163 --> 01:44:17,166
Shut down auxiliary control panel!

777
01:44:53,078 --> 01:44:55,371
Connect ventilation cartridges.

778
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:58,958
Start ventilators, connect cartridges.

779
01:45:27,738 --> 01:45:29,613
They ain't kidding.

780
01:45:31,158 --> 01:45:33,909
They really want to shake us up.

781
01:45:41,251 --> 01:45:43,085
So that was all?

782
01:45:44,755 --> 01:45:46,505
Calling it a day?

783
01:46:00,687 --> 01:46:02,938
Boy, we really gave it to them,

784
01:46:05,817 --> 01:46:09,111
when those bulkheads broke to pieces.

785
01:46:21,625 --> 01:46:23,542
What's the bearing?

786
01:46:24,378 --> 01:46:27,463
Steady at 65 degrees.

787
01:46:31,718 --> 01:46:33,636
Deeper. Silent run.

788
01:47:00,247 --> 01:47:02,039
New bearing?

789
01:47:04,668 --> 01:47:06,377
Fifty degrees.

790
01:47:07,504 --> 01:47:09,171
Growing louder.

791
01:47:30,819 --> 01:47:31,861
Come on.

792
01:47:43,623 --> 01:47:47,376
Still deeper.
Three degrees starboard.

793
01:47:48,086 --> 01:47:49,712
Let's throw them

794
01:47:52,924 --> 01:47:55,092
for another little loop.

795
01:48:01,975 --> 01:48:04,727
Bow steady. Stern up 10.

796
01:48:54,444 --> 01:48:56,946
Contact bearing 270 degrees.

797
01:49:00,325 --> 01:49:02,159
Fading.

798
01:49:18,176 --> 01:49:19,969
Right full rudder.

799
01:49:21,304 --> 01:49:23,305
Rudder is full right.

800
01:49:26,309 --> 01:49:27,977
To 90 degrees.

801
01:49:47,664 --> 01:49:49,999
Shit.

802
01:49:51,668 --> 01:49:55,004
Second propeller sounds, 76 degrees.
Closing fast.

803
01:49:59,009 --> 01:50:00,843
Reinforcements.

804
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,598
Those bastards.

805
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:38,422
Deeper.

806
01:50:44,137 --> 01:50:45,638
Deeper still.

807
01:50:50,769 --> 01:50:52,436
Bow down 10.

808
01:50:52,729 --> 01:50:54,229
Stern up 7.

809
01:51:12,749 --> 01:51:14,750
190 meters.

810
01:51:26,012 --> 01:51:27,846
200 meters.

811
01:51:40,276 --> 01:51:42,486
210 meters.

812
01:51:50,704 --> 01:51:52,955
220 meters.

813
01:52:00,505 --> 01:52:02,548
230 meters.

814
01:52:14,310 --> 01:52:16,478
The bolts! They're bursting!

815
01:52:16,646 --> 01:52:18,689
Keep the boat from dropping!
Up 10 meters!

816
01:52:19,983 --> 01:52:21,233
All ahead one-half!

817
01:52:28,324 --> 01:52:31,243
Quiet, men, quiet.

818
01:53:12,202 --> 01:53:14,578
Go to 150 meters! All ahead full!

819
01:53:23,379 --> 01:53:24,880
Port 20!

820
01:53:25,048 --> 01:53:26,548
Steer 50 degrees!

821
01:53:28,718 --> 01:53:30,803
Pretty good shooting, mister.

822
01:54:11,761 --> 01:54:13,262
Quiet, damn it!

823
01:54:13,429 --> 01:54:15,973
I want proper damage reports!

824
01:54:26,025 --> 01:54:28,277
Permission to check diesel?

825
01:54:29,696 --> 01:54:31,613
Take over the helm!

826
01:54:41,291 --> 01:54:44,126
Gaskets! Half-inch, hurry!

827
01:54:46,254 --> 01:54:47,921
Where are you?

828
01:54:48,089 --> 01:54:50,090
I need those gaskets!

829
01:54:50,383 --> 01:54:52,843
Torpedo hatch taking water!

830
01:54:59,893 --> 01:55:02,019
Tools! Hurry!

831
01:55:08,651 --> 01:55:11,570
The more they throw,
the sooner they run out.

832
01:55:27,170 --> 01:55:30,797
Leakage above exhaust vent repaired.

833
01:55:30,965 --> 01:55:34,259
150 meters, all ahead full.

834
01:55:52,779 --> 01:55:54,196
What's the matter?

835
01:56:02,288 --> 01:56:03,872
Return to your battle station.

836
01:56:04,165 --> 01:56:05,165
At once!

837
01:56:18,137 --> 01:56:20,263
Pull yourself together!

838
01:56:21,307 --> 01:56:22,599
Back!

839
01:56:27,522 --> 01:56:29,314
Go back, Johann.

840
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:52,337
Take him aft, quickly!

841
01:56:55,299 --> 01:56:56,591
He's gone, captain.

842
01:57:37,925 --> 01:57:40,635
Why Johann, of all people?

843
01:57:44,599 --> 01:57:46,224
Despicable.

844
01:57:48,770 --> 01:57:50,353
Shameless.

845
01:58:09,165 --> 01:58:12,667
Forget the headset.
We can hear it anyway.

846
01:58:37,985 --> 01:58:39,444
Come on, let's go.

847
01:59:05,388 --> 01:59:08,306
Boat dropping!

848
01:59:10,977 --> 01:59:12,602
190 meters!

849
01:59:40,464 --> 01:59:42,507
220 meters!

850
01:59:43,801 --> 01:59:45,802
We're drowning!

851
02:00:56,832 --> 02:00:59,834
Take this down for your log book.

852
02:01:03,506 --> 02:01:06,174
After 6 hours of silent run,

853
02:01:07,426 --> 02:01:09,177
it seems certain

854
02:01:10,179 --> 02:01:13,098
the enemy destroyers lost us.

855
02:01:15,768 --> 02:01:19,521
At 210 degrees,

856
02:01:19,689 --> 02:01:22,315
very heavy fire blazing.

857
02:01:22,650 --> 02:01:25,652
Assume it to be the tanker we hit.

858
02:01:35,621 --> 02:01:37,622
Surface in 10 minutes.

859
02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:19,748
See, lieutenant,

860
02:02:22,918 --> 02:02:25,045
they didn't kill us after all.

861
02:03:32,071 --> 02:03:34,572
Her backbone is broken.

862
02:03:38,244 --> 02:03:42,330
Damn tough ship, won't drown.

863
02:03:44,500 --> 02:03:46,167
Let's get to it.

864
02:03:46,335 --> 02:03:48,086
Target optics to bridge.

865
02:03:48,254 --> 02:03:50,422
Flood tube 1.

866
02:03:58,848 --> 02:04:00,473
Enemy movement nil.

867
02:04:02,309 --> 02:04:05,520
650 meters.

868
02:04:05,688 --> 02:04:09,107
Depth 4, torpedo speed 30.

869
02:04:09,817 --> 02:04:14,028
Target point,
directly before aft mast.

870
02:04:14,196 --> 02:04:16,489
Tube 1 ready.

871
02:04:20,202 --> 02:04:21,453
Fire!

872
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:07,248
Men still on board!

873
02:05:19,762 --> 02:05:21,596
Why weren't they rescued?

874
02:05:22,723 --> 02:05:24,265
Damn it!

875
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:26,100
After all these hours!

876
02:05:53,796 --> 02:05:55,630
They're swimming for us.

877
02:05:58,092 --> 02:05:59,551
All back one-half!

878
02:07:16,795 --> 02:07:17,920
Can I clear this?

879
02:07:18,088 --> 02:07:19,631
Mm-hm.

880
02:07:52,665 --> 02:07:53,831
Radiograms.

881
02:07:55,250 --> 02:07:56,751
Read them.

882
02:07:57,503 --> 02:08:01,714
"Three freighters sunk.
Convoys dispersed.

883
02:08:02,049 --> 02:08:03,716
Lost contact.

884
02:08:03,884 --> 02:08:06,552
In pursuit at 30 degrees."

885
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:07,762
From U-112.

886
02:08:09,390 --> 02:08:10,890
That's Wenzel.

887
02:08:11,058 --> 02:08:12,433
Not bad.

888
02:08:13,268 --> 02:08:15,728
Kupsch pursuing same convoy.

889
02:08:17,606 --> 02:08:20,066
Stackmann hit a 6000 tonner.

890
02:08:22,778 --> 02:08:24,779
Quite a battlefield.

891
02:08:26,782 --> 02:08:28,116
Can we get there?

892
02:08:31,245 --> 02:08:32,578
Difficult.

893
02:08:32,746 --> 02:08:34,455
At least 5 hours away.

894
02:08:35,624 --> 02:08:36,624
Our fuel...

895
02:08:36,792 --> 02:08:39,377
We couldn't do 5...
All right, already!

896
02:09:04,903 --> 02:09:06,279
When do we turn back?

897
02:09:13,996 --> 02:09:16,789
When I give the order,

898
02:09:17,332 --> 02:09:19,459
navigator.

899
02:09:51,867 --> 02:09:54,994
Fired at 950 meters.
Targeted aft mast.

900
02:09:55,162 --> 02:09:58,331
Crew, assumed rescued,
was still on board.

901
02:09:58,499 --> 02:10:01,250
Survivors swam toward U-96.

902
02:10:42,376 --> 02:10:44,669
I want to apologize.

903
02:10:45,754 --> 02:10:47,880
You can't just apologize.

904
02:10:49,758 --> 02:10:53,761
You left your battle station
at a critical time.

905
02:10:54,763 --> 02:10:56,931
Also, you disobeyed my order.

906
02:11:09,403 --> 02:11:11,946
Will l be court-martialed?

907
02:11:20,247 --> 02:11:21,956
How many war patrols for you?

908
02:11:23,125 --> 02:11:24,584
It's my ninth.

909
02:11:30,924 --> 02:11:33,551
You, of all people, Johann.

910
02:11:37,014 --> 02:11:39,056
It's never happened before.

911
02:11:48,775 --> 02:11:53,946
My nerves cracked somehow.

912
02:11:58,452 --> 02:12:02,580
It won't happen again.
You can count on me.

913
02:12:05,584 --> 02:12:07,501
I swear.

914
02:12:10,631 --> 02:12:12,340
All right, Johann.

915
02:12:14,927 --> 02:12:17,094
No court martial?

916
02:12:23,268 --> 02:12:25,686
Go on to bed.

917
02:12:39,451 --> 02:12:41,994
U-96 withdrew from survivors.

918
02:12:42,162 --> 02:12:45,206
Return to base 0700.

919
02:13:02,849 --> 02:13:04,558
Second officer!

920
02:13:11,525 --> 02:13:13,150
You'll fix it.

921
02:13:13,986 --> 02:13:15,903
It's the bulkhead conduit.

922
02:13:16,363 --> 02:13:17,905
It'll work.

923
02:13:20,742 --> 02:13:22,243
Morning.

924
02:13:23,912 --> 02:13:26,539
Get moving, signal to decode.

925
02:13:36,008 --> 02:13:37,758
More top secrets.

926
02:13:39,094 --> 02:13:41,429
Another special goose chase.

927
02:13:42,055 --> 02:13:43,889
Not us.

928
02:13:44,433 --> 02:13:46,267
We're ready for the wharf.

929
02:13:46,435 --> 02:13:50,021
And the fuel...
We won't even make La Rochelle.

930
02:13:50,605 --> 02:13:53,441
The last 100 miles...
We'll set sail.

931
02:13:54,067 --> 02:13:55,943
We'll be all right, chief.

932
02:13:58,530 --> 02:14:00,197
How's it coming?

933
02:14:03,952 --> 02:14:05,578
What you got?

934
02:14:07,247 --> 02:14:09,540
"For captain's eyes only."

935
02:14:34,399 --> 02:14:36,317
That's a first.

936
02:14:36,943 --> 02:14:38,986
Triple coded.

937
02:14:46,828 --> 02:14:49,580
Yeah.
Christmas in La Rochelle.

938
02:14:49,748 --> 02:14:51,290
Gonna get laid again.

939
02:14:51,458 --> 02:14:53,250
All of those sexy nurses,

940
02:14:53,418 --> 02:14:57,338
hot telephone operators,
all those warm bodies.

941
02:14:57,506 --> 02:14:59,006
Screwing like mad.

942
02:14:59,174 --> 02:15:03,677
A nice, slow afternoon fuck.

943
02:15:04,179 --> 02:15:06,514
Attention.
Our master's voice.

944
02:15:07,182 --> 02:15:08,265
La Rochelle's out.

945
02:15:10,310 --> 02:15:12,937
We've been ordered to a new port.

946
02:15:13,105 --> 02:15:14,230
La Spezia,

947
02:15:16,024 --> 02:15:18,359
in the Mediterranean.

948
02:15:19,027 --> 02:15:22,196
Fuel and provisions out of Vigo first.

949
02:15:22,697 --> 02:15:24,490
That's in Spain.

950
02:15:24,825 --> 02:15:26,200
That is all.

951
02:15:30,705 --> 02:15:32,832
Those bastards stuck it to us.

952
02:15:34,042 --> 02:15:35,126
Shit.

953
02:15:36,211 --> 02:15:38,295
No getting laid.

954
02:15:38,713 --> 02:15:42,049
No sexy nurses.
No hot telephone operators.

955
02:15:42,217 --> 02:15:44,093
Horse shit!

956
02:15:46,221 --> 02:15:48,556
Christmas with the Macaronis.

957
02:15:48,723 --> 02:15:51,392
Got to get there first, stupid!

958
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:53,894
What do you mean?

959
02:15:54,062 --> 02:15:55,980
Gibraltar!

960
02:15:56,231 --> 02:15:59,483
Stick a finger up your ass
to get the idea.

961
02:16:04,072 --> 02:16:06,323
It's as tight as a virgin.

962
02:16:07,325 --> 02:16:10,911
We'll need Vaseline to get through.

963
02:16:27,345 --> 02:16:28,762
The Mediterranean.

964
02:16:29,514 --> 02:16:31,432
They're nuts.

965
02:16:32,100 --> 02:16:34,894
It's swarming
with English combat ships.

966
02:16:35,103 --> 02:16:36,937
Stand by for calculations!

967
02:16:37,856 --> 02:16:39,190
Zero,

968
02:16:39,774 --> 02:16:42,943
25 degrees, 43.3 minutes.

969
02:16:44,779 --> 02:16:46,071
Gibraltar.

970
02:16:46,948 --> 02:16:49,742
Excellent prospects for drowning.

971
02:17:04,758 --> 02:17:08,636
You and the chief will go ashore
in Vigo.

972
02:17:09,804 --> 02:17:10,971
How's that?

973
02:17:11,473 --> 02:17:13,891
I'll radio it in a minute.

974
02:17:18,146 --> 02:17:21,148
I'll have to find a replacement
for the chief.

975
02:17:24,903 --> 02:17:28,072
They'll smuggle you
through Spain somehow,

976
02:17:29,616 --> 02:17:32,284
even if you have
to dress like gypsies.

977
02:17:33,453 --> 02:17:36,163
But I was on for the whole...
No heroics.

978
02:17:39,626 --> 02:17:41,585
It's already settled.

979
02:17:42,504 --> 02:17:45,005
One guy alone would be tough.

980
02:17:49,177 --> 02:17:52,137
We've got agents to get you through.

981
02:18:05,277 --> 02:18:07,611
Chief's wife is very ill.

982
02:18:10,991 --> 02:18:13,033
He's got to go ashore.

983
02:18:18,540 --> 02:18:20,207
Aye, aye, sir.

984
02:18:35,974 --> 02:18:37,391
Pretty bad, huh?

985
02:18:50,238 --> 02:18:52,573
I'm going ashore at Vigo

986
02:18:54,326 --> 02:18:56,493
with the chief.

987
02:18:58,330 --> 02:19:00,372
Captain's orders.

988
02:19:04,794 --> 02:19:10,591
Want me to take your letters?

989
02:19:27,734 --> 02:19:29,943
But it's a big pile.

990
02:19:33,907 --> 02:19:36,617
Well, it's a big love, right?

991
02:20:18,076 --> 02:20:19,118
Equalize pressure.

992
02:20:27,460 --> 02:20:28,752
All quiet.

993
02:20:29,796 --> 02:20:30,963
White light.

994
02:20:31,131 --> 02:20:32,923
Watch where you stomp.

995
02:20:33,591 --> 02:20:35,342
Quiet, man!

996
02:20:43,309 --> 02:20:46,311
We've got to find the right tub here.

997
02:20:48,982 --> 02:20:50,858
The "Weser",

998
02:20:52,777 --> 02:20:55,779
a German merchant vessel,
is interned here.

999
02:20:56,823 --> 02:21:01,160
With a bellyful of torpedoes,
fuel and provisions.

1000
02:21:01,536 --> 02:21:03,871
Just for us.

1001
02:21:04,539 --> 02:21:07,541
Yeah, 1st class service.

1002
02:21:20,346 --> 02:21:21,805
Starboard engine stop.

1003
02:21:24,684 --> 02:21:26,393
We've arrived.

1004
02:21:26,561 --> 02:21:28,353
Port engine stop.

1005
02:21:37,405 --> 02:21:38,906
Officers to bridge.

1006
02:21:40,909 --> 02:21:42,326
Watch out on deck.

1007
02:21:54,881 --> 02:21:56,006
Gentlemen.

1008
02:22:02,847 --> 02:22:06,850
We welcome our heroic
German U-boat crew.

1009
02:22:18,613 --> 02:22:20,447
A wholehearted welcome,

1010
02:22:20,782 --> 02:22:22,407
captain.

1011
02:22:22,617 --> 02:22:26,453
No, please, not me.

1012
02:22:27,705 --> 02:22:29,540
This is the captain.

1013
02:22:29,874 --> 02:22:31,917
My apologies.

1014
02:22:34,212 --> 02:22:38,131
Welcome aboard the "Weser," captain.

1015
02:22:38,967 --> 02:22:43,637
A real hero, in person.
I am most delighted.

1016
02:22:44,806 --> 02:22:46,306
Well, gentlemen,

1017
02:22:46,474 --> 02:22:48,767
here they are,

1018
02:22:48,935 --> 02:22:51,395
heroes of the deep.

1019
02:22:51,563 --> 02:22:53,772
The famous grey wolves,

1020
02:22:53,940 --> 02:22:57,317
with us, inside our modest cabin,

1021
02:22:57,652 --> 02:22:59,778
so to speak.

1022
02:22:59,946 --> 02:23:02,573
Captain, allow me.

1023
02:23:02,740 --> 02:23:04,241
A warm welcome.

1024
02:23:04,409 --> 02:23:05,993
Nice tugboat you've got here.

1025
02:23:10,957 --> 02:23:12,791
We're well prepared,

1026
02:23:12,959 --> 02:23:16,295
in all modesty, of course,
but not bad at all.

1027
02:23:16,462 --> 02:23:19,840
Like a taste of home, so to speak.

1028
02:23:20,842 --> 02:23:23,969
Fresh bread,
cakes from our own bakery,

1029
02:23:24,137 --> 02:23:28,515
bacon, fresh sausages,
stuffed just today, naturally.

1030
02:23:30,143 --> 02:23:32,769
You've got to tell us your news.

1031
02:23:32,937 --> 02:23:35,856
You can't imagine our curiosity.

1032
02:23:37,191 --> 02:23:40,652
It's not an easy life here,
appearances to the contrary.

1033
02:23:40,820 --> 02:23:44,698
There's plenty of fuel and food
to eat,

1034
02:23:44,866 --> 02:23:47,868
but torpedoes are difficult
to come by.

1035
02:23:49,287 --> 02:23:51,496
But we always have our ways.

1036
02:23:52,457 --> 02:23:57,127
The Spaniards tolerate us,
but there's no love lost between us.

1037
02:23:57,295 --> 02:23:59,504
Christmas bread.

1038
02:24:00,673 --> 02:24:03,342
Hmm? So, tell me,

1039
02:24:03,551 --> 02:24:05,552
how many ships have you sunk?

1040
02:24:05,720 --> 02:24:08,138
Let me guess...

1041
02:24:08,306 --> 02:24:09,848
The champagne.

1042
02:24:10,016 --> 02:24:12,017
How forgetful of me.

1043
02:24:12,185 --> 02:24:13,518
Please.

1044
02:24:14,228 --> 02:24:15,812
Gentlemen.

1045
02:24:18,358 --> 02:24:20,567
We drink to your health.

1046
02:24:20,735 --> 02:24:22,736
We are so proud of you.

1047
02:24:24,072 --> 02:24:27,074
We toast the German U-boats,
and our beloved Füh...

1048
02:24:30,078 --> 02:24:32,663
I forget we're not at home here,

1049
02:24:32,830 --> 02:24:34,706
if you know what I mean.

1050
02:24:36,125 --> 02:24:37,167
Cheers.

1051
02:24:38,002 --> 02:24:39,920
To your health.

1052
02:24:42,048 --> 02:24:44,883
Come on, dig in.

1053
02:24:45,843 --> 02:24:47,886
Let's dive into this stuff.

1054
02:24:53,226 --> 02:24:55,602
Come, captain, tell us all.

1055
02:24:55,770 --> 02:24:58,188
We're so very curious.

1056
02:24:59,440 --> 02:25:01,566
Those are fresh figs.

1057
02:25:09,867 --> 02:25:11,618
Never had one before.

1058
02:25:19,001 --> 02:25:21,461
Shh. Quiet, gentlemen.

1059
02:25:25,299 --> 02:25:27,968
They almost had us this time.

1060
02:25:33,141 --> 02:25:34,599
Phenomenal.

1061
02:25:36,310 --> 02:25:39,479
You see,
that's the language of a hero.

1062
02:25:39,647 --> 02:25:42,482
To-the-point. Simply phenomenal.

1063
02:25:43,109 --> 02:25:45,652
But you can't get away that easily.

1064
02:25:45,820 --> 02:25:48,989
Hand me that. Herring salad.

1065
02:25:49,407 --> 02:25:51,324
Our cook's specialty.

1066
02:25:51,492 --> 02:25:53,660
You must try it.

1067
02:25:54,662 --> 02:25:57,164
Come on now, taste it.

1068
02:26:02,253 --> 02:26:04,838
How's it feel beneath the surface,

1069
02:26:05,006 --> 02:26:06,923
submerged,

1070
02:26:07,592 --> 02:26:10,010
while the enemy lurks above?

1071
02:26:10,636 --> 02:26:12,095
Dark.

1072
02:26:15,099 --> 02:26:16,767
And real quiet.

1073
02:26:17,018 --> 02:26:19,019
As long as nobody farts.

1074
02:26:21,856 --> 02:26:22,981
Pardon me?

1075
02:26:23,357 --> 02:26:26,985
As long as...
He means, on silent runs,

1076
02:26:27,153 --> 02:26:30,489
the crew must show extreme discipline.

1077
02:26:30,656 --> 02:26:32,365
And that's why nobody can fart.

1078
02:26:36,788 --> 02:26:39,873
Herr Seewald,
we've been expecting you.

1079
02:26:43,711 --> 02:26:45,879
The delegate of the naval attache.

1080
02:26:48,216 --> 02:26:50,801
I have messages from headquarters.

1081
02:26:53,221 --> 02:26:55,972
But first, your orders for Gibraltar.

1082
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:02,354
And this radiogram.

1083
02:27:13,407 --> 02:27:16,034
Chief, Lieutenant Werner.

1084
02:27:20,248 --> 02:27:22,249
We're taking a stroll.

1085
02:27:31,551 --> 02:27:33,176
What's going on?

1086
02:27:33,553 --> 02:27:35,095
Bad news.

1087
02:27:41,727 --> 02:27:44,437
Request was denied by headquarters.

1088
02:27:50,403 --> 02:27:53,989
You've got to stay on board.
You too, lieutenant.

1089
02:28:01,622 --> 02:28:03,290
I'm sorry.

1090
02:28:07,128 --> 02:28:09,421
It's probably just as well.

1091
02:28:12,466 --> 02:28:15,302
Who knows who they'd replace me with?

1092
02:28:19,265 --> 02:28:23,476
Might be one of those
wet-behind-the-ears kids.

1093
02:28:28,816 --> 02:28:30,775
Very well could be.

1094
02:28:32,403 --> 02:28:36,323
They should've put some pussy
in storage for screwing.

1095
02:28:36,490 --> 02:28:40,577
Yeah, you'd be fighting
Spanish crabs by now.

1096
02:28:40,912 --> 02:28:42,996
Better than blue balls!

1097
02:28:43,164 --> 02:28:46,333
Move it and clear the chart table.

1098
02:28:46,500 --> 02:28:48,627
I can't navigate on bananas.

1099
02:28:49,587 --> 02:28:52,005
Are you nuts? Move that fruit.

1100
02:28:52,173 --> 02:28:54,090
The depth controls are blocked.

1101
02:28:56,177 --> 02:28:57,510
That's a Christmas tree?

1102
02:28:57,678 --> 02:29:00,180
It ain't camouflage for the bridge.

1103
02:29:05,102 --> 02:29:06,853
We're staying on board.

1104
02:29:07,021 --> 02:29:08,980
Orders from headquarters.

1105
02:29:20,368 --> 02:29:23,078
Sorry, Ullman.
Mm.

1106
02:29:39,637 --> 02:29:42,681
Seven miles between coasts.

1107
02:29:43,349 --> 02:29:45,350
A tight squeeze, I'd say.

1108
02:29:47,687 --> 02:29:49,896
These are the British docks.

1109
02:29:50,731 --> 02:29:54,901
Their only port for repairs
in the western Mediterranean.

1110
02:29:56,696 --> 02:29:59,364
It will be well protected.

1111
02:30:03,077 --> 02:30:05,245
All kinds of defenses.

1112
02:30:08,374 --> 02:30:11,584
Anything floating will be
on the water.

1113
02:30:15,131 --> 02:30:17,424
We'll have to maneuver through it.

1114
02:30:18,676 --> 02:30:20,844
That's the situation.

1115
02:30:33,524 --> 02:30:35,775
We'll move under cover of darkness,

1116
02:30:37,194 --> 02:30:39,070
skimming the surface.

1117
02:30:43,534 --> 02:30:46,286
We'll cut right
through the English ships.

1118
02:30:51,250 --> 02:30:54,753
As close to the Strait of Gibraltar
as we can get.

1119
02:31:04,513 --> 02:31:06,514
Then we'll dive,

1120
02:31:08,225 --> 02:31:10,226
and let ourselves drop.

1121
02:31:20,821 --> 02:31:22,322
Dive,

1122
02:31:24,575 --> 02:31:27,869
then float with the current
through the strait.

1123
02:31:34,210 --> 02:31:36,377
No racket.

1124
02:31:38,672 --> 02:31:40,048
It saves fuel.

1125
02:31:49,016 --> 02:31:50,517
So, Kriechbaum?

1126
02:31:57,316 --> 02:31:59,692
Not bad, captain.

1127
02:32:26,887 --> 02:32:28,388
Let's go.

1128
02:32:33,018 --> 02:32:36,104
All ahead one-half.

1129
02:32:39,608 --> 02:32:43,027
Navigator and l stay,
everyone else clear the bridge.

1130
02:33:15,978 --> 02:33:18,605
Half the English fleet is here.

1131
02:33:20,482 --> 02:33:23,443
Two degrees to port.
Switch to electric motor.

1132
02:33:59,730 --> 02:34:01,564
Destroyer across port.

1133
02:34:01,732 --> 02:34:04,150
800, running parallel.

1134
02:34:04,860 --> 02:34:06,277
What's he doing?

1135
02:34:06,987 --> 02:34:08,029
Closing in?

1136
02:34:14,870 --> 02:34:16,496
No, moving ahead.

1137
02:34:17,665 --> 02:34:19,165
Very good.

1138
02:34:25,005 --> 02:34:26,839
Left full rudder.

1139
02:34:28,175 --> 02:34:30,969
All ahead full.

1140
02:34:33,639 --> 02:34:35,223
All right, then.

1141
02:35:27,401 --> 02:35:29,861
Right full rudder! All ahead full.

1142
02:35:32,656 --> 02:35:33,823
Damn!

1143
02:36:00,601 --> 02:36:02,310
Gibraltar.

1144
02:36:15,074 --> 02:36:17,742
We'll dive in 10 minutes.

1145
02:36:34,301 --> 02:36:35,802
Alarm!

1146
02:36:36,011 --> 02:36:37,220
Flood tanks!

1147
02:36:43,185 --> 02:36:44,310
Watch out, don't dive!

1148
02:36:44,478 --> 02:36:47,730
- Captain's still on bridge!
- Kriechbaum's wounded!

1149
02:36:49,608 --> 02:36:52,193
Both diesels ahead full!

1150
02:36:52,403 --> 02:36:54,862
Blow all tanks!

1151
02:36:55,072 --> 02:36:56,989
Prepare to abandon ship!

1152
02:36:59,243 --> 02:37:02,495
Medic to officers' mess immediately!

1153
02:37:06,708 --> 02:37:09,419
Where's the medic?

1154
02:37:09,628 --> 02:37:12,547
Maximum power!
Right full rudder!

1155
02:37:15,300 --> 02:37:16,884
All men into rescue gear!

1156
02:37:17,052 --> 02:37:18,636
Prepare to abandon!

1157
02:37:18,804 --> 02:37:20,388
Hold this!

1158
02:37:27,396 --> 02:37:31,315
Faster, faster!

1159
02:37:41,285 --> 02:37:43,494
Get a compress!

1160
02:37:55,340 --> 02:37:58,634
Gotta shut down port diesel.
It's pulled loose.

1161
02:37:58,802 --> 02:38:00,428
Keep full speed!

1162
02:38:00,637 --> 02:38:04,182
Give it everything she's got!

1163
02:38:04,933 --> 02:38:06,517
What's he going to do?

1164
02:38:06,685 --> 02:38:07,727
Southern course,

1165
02:38:07,895 --> 02:38:10,271
moving toward the African coast.

1166
02:38:18,989 --> 02:38:21,491
Damn.

1167
02:38:25,454 --> 02:38:27,413
Flood tanks!

1168
02:38:27,581 --> 02:38:29,749
All men to bow!

1169
02:38:40,427 --> 02:38:41,552
Down to 90 meters.

1170
02:38:46,391 --> 02:38:49,435
Bow plane jammed!
Use manual rudder!

1171
02:38:51,730 --> 02:38:54,857
Bow plane stuck in full down position!

1172
02:39:03,534 --> 02:39:04,909
Both engines stop.

1173
02:39:05,285 --> 02:39:07,370
All men aft!

1174
02:39:14,086 --> 02:39:15,670
Hurry! Faster!

1175
02:39:15,879 --> 02:39:17,171
Trim all to stern!

1176
02:39:18,632 --> 02:39:20,132
Ballast pump down!

1177
02:39:20,300 --> 02:39:21,300
Trim with air!

1178
02:39:24,972 --> 02:39:26,138
Still sinking.

1179
02:39:26,306 --> 02:39:28,057
Load unchanged.

1180
02:39:28,225 --> 02:39:30,434
Gotta lose weight!

1181
02:39:30,602 --> 02:39:32,812
Pump 1000 liters!

1182
02:39:35,607 --> 02:39:37,441
Shut him up, medic!

1183
02:39:39,361 --> 02:39:40,861
Main pump down!

1184
02:39:42,155 --> 02:39:43,781
Blow tanks?

1185
02:39:44,116 --> 02:39:45,533
All back full!

1186
02:39:52,291 --> 02:39:53,833
Boat not responding.

1187
02:39:54,001 --> 02:39:57,003
Blow tanks. Blow tanks!

1188
02:39:57,170 --> 02:39:58,212
Blow front.

1189
02:40:02,718 --> 02:40:04,719
Stop now.

1190
02:40:07,222 --> 02:40:09,724
Why don't you stop!

1191
02:40:11,476 --> 02:40:13,936
Give it whatever she's got, chief!

1192
02:40:14,104 --> 02:40:15,104
Blow them all!

1193
02:40:17,107 --> 02:40:18,482
Come on up.

1194
02:40:45,010 --> 02:40:48,012
Boat is beyond control.

1195
02:40:53,226 --> 02:40:54,226
200.

1196
02:40:58,482 --> 02:40:59,565
210.

1197
02:41:04,321 --> 02:41:05,571
220 meters.

1198
02:41:08,784 --> 02:41:10,701
Beyond 230.

1199
02:41:11,828 --> 02:41:13,496
240 meters.

1200
02:41:16,249 --> 02:41:17,708
250 meters.

1201
02:41:23,590 --> 02:41:25,216
My God.

1202
02:41:26,718 --> 02:41:29,178
Do not turn

1203
02:41:29,638 --> 02:41:31,889
Thy face away from me.

1204
02:42:22,941 --> 02:42:24,608
A shovelful of sand.

1205
02:42:27,988 --> 02:42:31,907
God threw a shovelful
of sand beneath our keel.

1206
02:42:43,962 --> 02:42:45,463
280 meters.

1207
02:42:47,048 --> 02:42:49,216
This boat's amazing.

1208
02:43:39,684 --> 02:43:41,644
Torpedo hatch taking water!

1209
02:43:44,898 --> 02:43:47,149
Taking water behind control panel!

1210
02:43:49,194 --> 02:43:52,279
Taking water in motor bilge!

1211
02:43:53,281 --> 02:43:55,449
Tube 5 taking water!

1212
02:43:59,538 --> 02:44:00,788
What you need?

1213
02:44:00,956 --> 02:44:03,916
Leakage plugs.
In the bow.

1214
02:44:06,127 --> 02:44:07,253
Exhaust valve?

1215
02:44:07,921 --> 02:44:10,130
Leakage plugs! Move!

1216
02:44:13,844 --> 02:44:15,761
Give me that lamp!

1217
02:44:16,471 --> 02:44:18,138
I need a wrench, damn it!

1218
02:44:18,306 --> 02:44:20,015
Where are my reports?

1219
02:44:20,851 --> 02:44:23,060
Taking water at tower frame!

1220
02:44:23,228 --> 02:44:25,229
Where are the tools?

1221
02:44:30,819 --> 02:44:32,570
Where is it?
Bilge pump!

1222
02:44:34,364 --> 02:44:36,115
Motor control panels down!

1223
02:44:36,283 --> 02:44:37,700
Diesel's all busted!

1224
02:44:37,868 --> 02:44:39,618
I demand proper reports!

1225
02:44:46,167 --> 02:44:47,501
Where's it worst?

1226
02:44:47,669 --> 02:44:50,754
Shaft valves and housing.

1227
02:44:51,381 --> 02:44:53,966
Machinist, battery two,

1228
02:44:54,134 --> 02:44:56,135
determine damages.

1229
02:44:58,638 --> 02:45:01,098
Don't strip the crankshafts.

1230
02:45:01,266 --> 02:45:02,474
Can't see a thing!

1231
02:45:02,684 --> 02:45:05,561
Push harder!

1232
02:45:05,729 --> 02:45:06,979
I'm pushing!

1233
02:45:07,772 --> 02:45:10,274
Can't get the wedge in!

1234
02:45:10,442 --> 02:45:12,151
Give me that hammer!

1235
02:45:18,658 --> 02:45:21,160
Need more men aft?

1236
02:45:21,328 --> 02:45:23,537
I'll find out!

1237
02:45:25,582 --> 02:45:27,041
Damn it.
Can I help?

1238
02:45:27,208 --> 02:45:28,876
Hold the light!

1239
02:45:29,669 --> 02:45:32,922
Father, don't forsake us.

1240
02:45:34,174 --> 02:45:35,174
Stupid asshole!

1241
02:45:35,342 --> 02:45:38,135
Aah!
Damn idiot.

1242
02:45:39,596 --> 02:45:41,680
I need the diesel room toolbox.

1243
02:45:41,890 --> 02:45:43,641
Hurry!

1244
02:45:44,267 --> 02:45:45,935
Where are the tools?

1245
02:45:49,356 --> 02:45:50,564
Bigger wrench!

1246
02:45:51,149 --> 02:45:53,108
Leakage in diesel bilge!

1247
02:46:02,118 --> 02:46:05,454
Tighten them carefully.
Don't break the bolts.

1248
02:46:07,332 --> 02:46:08,540
Cooling pipe leaking!

1249
02:46:11,753 --> 02:46:15,089
Get down there
and tighten those valves!

1250
02:46:17,759 --> 02:46:20,177
Give me that timber!

1251
02:46:25,308 --> 02:46:28,185
More plugs, hurry!

1252
02:46:40,782 --> 02:46:42,700
Gently, men.

1253
02:46:54,379 --> 02:46:56,296
Taking water fast in stern.

1254
02:46:56,464 --> 02:47:00,801
All hull valves burst.
Cooling system down.

1255
02:47:00,969 --> 02:47:05,597
Compressors dislodged.
Shaft valves taking water.

1256
02:47:07,600 --> 02:47:09,852
What about fuel leaks?

1257
02:47:10,020 --> 02:47:11,103
Can't tell yet.

1258
02:47:11,271 --> 02:47:14,356
Anything else?
Battery cells are cracked.

1259
02:47:14,524 --> 02:47:16,525
They can't take this.

1260
02:47:22,615 --> 02:47:24,033
Acid in the bilge.

1261
02:47:24,200 --> 02:47:27,995
Neutralize with lime wash.
Count drained cells.

1262
02:47:28,163 --> 02:47:31,331
Get battery connectors, hurry!

1263
02:47:49,642 --> 02:47:50,642
Over here!

1264
02:47:50,810 --> 02:47:53,312
I need plugs and a hammer!

1265
02:47:58,109 --> 02:48:00,986
Here it is.
Thanks, lieutenant.

1266
02:48:14,125 --> 02:48:15,834
Calm down.

1267
02:48:23,802 --> 02:48:25,052
Tell the chief.

1268
02:48:25,220 --> 02:48:29,098
Taking water in motor room.
Rising above torpedo tubes.

1269
02:48:38,983 --> 02:48:40,400
Careful.

1270
02:48:47,117 --> 02:48:48,784
Twenty-four cells drained.

1271
02:48:48,952 --> 02:48:51,870
Twenty-four cells. Holy shit.

1272
02:49:01,381 --> 02:49:03,590
We're way short of connectors.

1273
02:49:07,720 --> 02:49:11,431
He's got to bridge
those damaged cells.

1274
02:49:11,724 --> 02:49:13,183
Or else we've had it.

1275
02:49:15,979 --> 02:49:18,313
Can't tighten it. Can't see.

1276
02:49:18,481 --> 02:49:20,399
Lieutenant, lights!

1277
02:49:21,693 --> 02:49:24,319
If we don't fix this, we're goners!

1278
02:49:33,663 --> 02:49:36,290
To the right, more to the right.

1279
02:49:43,882 --> 02:49:45,174
Wire.

1280
02:49:45,675 --> 02:49:47,593
I need wire for bridging.

1281
02:49:48,720 --> 02:49:51,763
Move it, we need wire.
Hurry up.

1282
02:49:58,980 --> 02:50:02,191
The chief needs wire.
Look for wire.

1283
02:50:02,442 --> 02:50:04,318
Move it. Search for wire.

1284
02:50:04,527 --> 02:50:07,029
Incredible torpedoes in these tubes.

1285
02:50:07,989 --> 02:50:10,490
Twenty-five thousand Marks apiece.

1286
02:50:10,658 --> 02:50:12,367
And we can't find

1287
02:50:12,535 --> 02:50:14,119
a piece of wire.

1288
02:50:14,287 --> 02:50:17,164
Some old wire worth 50 pennies.

1289
02:50:19,959 --> 02:50:21,668
Periscope hydraulics jammed.

1290
02:50:21,836 --> 02:50:24,004
Can't be moved manually, either.

1291
02:50:27,300 --> 02:50:28,508
Wire.

1292
02:50:29,469 --> 02:50:31,345
Finally, something.

1293
02:50:31,512 --> 02:50:32,888
Pliers!

1294
02:50:46,402 --> 02:50:47,694
Leaks stopped.

1295
02:50:53,618 --> 02:50:54,660
Good, Johann.

1296
02:50:59,332 --> 02:51:00,916
Really good.

1297
02:51:06,339 --> 02:51:08,924
Now, get out of those wet rags.

1298
02:51:19,811 --> 02:51:21,895
Now let's get it out.

1299
02:51:22,063 --> 02:51:24,189
This water's got to go.

1300
02:51:25,441 --> 02:51:27,109
First, into the control room bilge,

1301
02:51:28,569 --> 02:51:29,778
and then out.

1302
02:51:36,369 --> 02:51:38,829
Faster. Let's get rid of it.

1303
02:51:47,588 --> 02:51:50,382
And scoop. And scoop.

1304
02:51:57,807 --> 02:52:01,143
Get with it.
No falling asleep back there.

1305
02:52:07,775 --> 02:52:09,901
Three more cells starboard.

1306
02:52:22,415 --> 02:52:23,999
Where do we stand?

1307
02:52:24,584 --> 02:52:27,502
Almost done. Three cells to go.

1308
02:52:40,016 --> 02:52:42,893
Make way for the chief.

1309
02:53:09,754 --> 02:53:12,381
Entire compass system is down,

1310
02:53:14,133 --> 02:53:17,094
probably the sonar too.

1311
02:53:17,261 --> 02:53:18,845
Radio is totally out.

1312
02:53:21,641 --> 02:53:23,392
Quite a mess.

1313
02:53:26,104 --> 02:53:27,646
Can we surface?

1314
02:53:33,611 --> 02:53:35,028
Any chance at all?

1315
02:53:42,036 --> 02:53:44,246
Good question.

1316
02:53:49,877 --> 02:53:52,838
Some air may be left
in the ballast tanks,

1317
02:53:53,673 --> 02:53:55,465
from all that blowing.

1318
02:53:57,885 --> 02:54:00,095
That might help us.

1319
02:54:00,346 --> 02:54:03,098
With every last bit of air pressure,

1320
02:54:08,396 --> 02:54:09,855
maybe...

1321
02:54:14,152 --> 02:54:16,736
We've got to reduce our weight.

1322
02:54:18,281 --> 02:54:20,615
That water has to get out.

1323
02:54:27,623 --> 02:54:29,708
Might work. It just might!

1324
02:54:32,170 --> 02:54:34,296
Aft is almost bailed.

1325
02:54:41,804 --> 02:54:43,138
It could work,

1326
02:54:43,306 --> 02:54:45,182
by hand into tanks,

1327
02:54:45,349 --> 02:54:46,600
then with main pump,

1328
02:54:46,767 --> 02:54:49,603
and air pressure,
the water's pushed out.

1329
02:54:49,770 --> 02:54:51,563
Main pump?

1330
02:54:52,273 --> 02:54:53,899
Can do.

1331
02:54:57,862 --> 02:55:00,071
Then we go for broke.

1332
02:55:01,574 --> 02:55:03,158
Blow tanks, and...

1333
02:55:04,785 --> 02:55:06,661
We'll get only one try.

1334
02:55:08,873 --> 02:55:09,998
When?

1335
02:55:10,166 --> 02:55:12,334
Once everything's repaired.

1336
02:55:12,502 --> 02:55:14,294
In 6 to 8 hours.

1337
02:55:16,422 --> 02:55:19,382
CO2 content?
1.8 percent.

1338
02:55:20,468 --> 02:55:22,219
We got enough oxygen?

1339
02:55:22,887 --> 02:55:24,221
No.

1340
02:55:27,141 --> 02:55:29,851
Pass out oxygen masks as needed,

1341
02:55:30,019 --> 02:55:31,561
men off duty to their bunks.

1342
02:56:44,468 --> 02:56:45,844
How's he doing?

1343
02:56:46,012 --> 02:56:47,804
Hard to tell.

1344
02:57:06,657 --> 02:57:08,533
Doesn't look good.

1345
02:57:48,199 --> 02:57:49,783
So, Pilgrim,

1346
02:57:51,285 --> 02:57:52,577
all okay?

1347
02:57:52,745 --> 02:57:54,913
Yes, captain.

1348
02:57:55,081 --> 02:57:57,165
It's all okay.

1349
02:58:00,461 --> 02:58:02,712
How are things aft?

1350
02:58:03,297 --> 02:58:05,590
Moving along, captain.

1351
02:58:07,843 --> 02:58:10,387
Guess I'll show my face then, huh?

1352
02:58:43,796 --> 02:58:45,422
Be careful.

1353
02:59:08,237 --> 02:59:10,029
All right here?

1354
02:59:10,197 --> 02:59:12,574
Okay. Doing fine.

1355
02:59:17,913 --> 02:59:21,666
Sure, captain. It'll work out.

1356
02:59:29,425 --> 02:59:31,217
How's it going?

1357
02:59:33,053 --> 02:59:36,264
Got to change two more bearings.

1358
03:00:42,164 --> 03:00:43,748
Do you want some glucose?

1359
03:01:24,957 --> 03:01:26,499
Crazy idea

1360
03:01:27,626 --> 03:01:30,003
to ram us through this strait.

1361
03:01:31,463 --> 03:01:33,631
It was bound to go wrong.

1362
03:01:38,888 --> 03:01:40,889
He knew it.

1363
03:01:42,558 --> 03:01:45,393
That old fox knew it all along.

1364
03:01:50,482 --> 03:01:54,319
Since he got that radiogram,

1365
03:01:54,904 --> 03:01:57,655
ordering us to break through.

1366
03:02:00,200 --> 03:02:04,162
That's why he wanted us off the boat

1367
03:02:04,330 --> 03:02:06,039
in Vigo.

1368
03:02:11,003 --> 03:02:14,047
There was no chance to get through.

1369
03:02:29,772 --> 03:02:33,858
He wanted to make us believe
it was possible

1370
03:02:34,526 --> 03:02:36,235
with a simple trick.

1371
03:02:40,783 --> 03:02:44,619
"Drop down and glide through"...

1372
03:02:49,416 --> 03:02:52,126
Not a bad trick,

1373
03:02:54,421 --> 03:02:56,923
except that it had to work.

1374
03:03:03,931 --> 03:03:07,725
Will we ever surface, chief?

1375
03:03:16,402 --> 03:03:17,902
I don't know.

1376
03:04:07,870 --> 03:04:09,537
I'm sorry.

1377
03:04:11,707 --> 03:04:13,791
Is it hopeless?

1378
03:04:17,546 --> 03:04:20,339
It's been 15 hours.

1379
03:04:28,474 --> 03:04:30,308
He's not going to pull it off.

1380
03:04:52,915 --> 03:04:54,540
I'm sorry.

1381
03:05:03,342 --> 03:05:05,760
I asked for it.

1382
03:05:11,683 --> 03:05:15,436
"To be heading into the inexorable,

1383
03:05:17,189 --> 03:05:21,609
where no mother will care for us,

1384
03:05:22,903 --> 03:05:26,531
no woman crosses our path,

1385
03:05:28,033 --> 03:05:32,453
where only reality reigns,
with cruelty and grandeur."

1386
03:05:43,799 --> 03:05:46,300
I was drunk with those words.

1387
03:05:53,225 --> 03:05:56,060
Well, this is reality.

1388
03:06:47,112 --> 03:06:49,322
Reporting to the captain.

1389
03:06:54,161 --> 03:06:55,995
Electric motor fixed.

1390
03:06:57,289 --> 03:06:59,624
Main pump fixed.

1391
03:07:00,042 --> 03:07:02,210
Water can be pumped into tanks,

1392
03:07:04,379 --> 03:07:07,465
then blown out with compressed air.

1393
03:07:08,550 --> 03:07:10,551
Compass ready.

1394
03:07:11,637 --> 03:07:13,512
Sonar ready.

1395
03:07:29,821 --> 03:07:31,822
Good, chief.

1396
03:07:47,422 --> 03:07:49,423
Take a rest now.

1397
03:07:58,016 --> 03:08:00,393
Still got a few small problems.

1398
03:08:46,231 --> 03:08:48,816
All you need is good people.

1399
03:08:52,946 --> 03:08:54,739
Good people.

1400
03:08:59,119 --> 03:09:00,661
Listen up.

1401
03:09:04,166 --> 03:09:06,334
We're going to blow tanks now

1402
03:09:06,918 --> 03:09:09,587
to see if we can lift our butt.

1403
03:09:13,008 --> 03:09:14,258
If we do,

1404
03:09:15,177 --> 03:09:17,428
it might get uncomfortable again.

1405
03:09:19,598 --> 03:09:21,599
Lots of traffic up there.

1406
03:09:26,938 --> 03:09:28,689
So all we can do

1407
03:09:29,649 --> 03:09:32,109
is pray those diesels start up.

1408
03:09:33,445 --> 03:09:36,113
Then full speed ahead and off we go,

1409
03:09:36,698 --> 03:09:38,699
out of this crater,

1410
03:09:39,618 --> 03:09:41,452
and back home.

1411
03:09:43,205 --> 03:09:44,705
If it works,

1412
03:09:46,124 --> 03:09:47,708
half a bottle of beer for everyone.

1413
03:09:52,672 --> 03:09:55,466
We just might get lucky.

1414
03:09:58,011 --> 03:10:00,179
They're not expecting us.

1415
03:10:07,729 --> 03:10:09,313
Well, men,

1416
03:10:11,650 --> 03:10:12,817
are we ready?

1417
03:10:18,698 --> 03:10:20,491
Contact bearings?

1418
03:10:20,659 --> 03:10:21,992
No contact.

1419
03:10:22,994 --> 03:10:25,496
Prepare to surface, rescue gear ready.

1420
03:10:25,664 --> 03:10:27,331
Switch to red lights.

1421
03:10:29,459 --> 03:10:31,168
Man your diving stations.

1422
03:10:56,445 --> 03:10:58,028
Blow tanks.

1423
03:12:13,313 --> 03:12:14,605
Boat rising!

1424
03:12:16,942 --> 03:12:19,109
Quiet men! Calm down!

1425
03:12:30,038 --> 03:12:31,789
270 meters.

1426
03:12:33,959 --> 03:12:35,793
First watch, get ready.

1427
03:12:36,545 --> 03:12:38,504
260 meters.

1428
03:12:45,303 --> 03:12:47,137
250 meters.

1429
03:12:55,981 --> 03:12:57,815
240 meters.

1430
03:13:03,822 --> 03:13:05,698
230 meters.

1431
03:13:11,162 --> 03:13:12,997
220.

1432
03:13:53,288 --> 03:13:54,913
Hatch is open.

1433
03:14:08,887 --> 03:14:10,596
How about the engines?

1434
03:14:16,061 --> 03:14:17,436
Both diesels.

1435
03:14:19,105 --> 03:14:21,315
Now everything hinges on this.

1436
03:14:47,425 --> 03:14:48,425
I think

1437
03:14:48,677 --> 03:14:50,678
it's running!

1438
03:14:50,845 --> 03:14:52,805
Who says you can't make something
out of nothing?

1439
03:15:15,954 --> 03:15:17,788
They won't get us this time.

1440
03:15:17,956 --> 03:15:19,456
Not again!

1441
03:15:23,128 --> 03:15:25,671
Hang in there, damn it.

1442
03:15:26,172 --> 03:15:27,965
Hang in there!

1443
03:15:28,633 --> 03:15:31,969
Three degrees to starboard.
Course 320 degrees.

1444
03:15:33,179 --> 03:15:34,972
There he goes again!

1445
03:15:39,561 --> 03:15:41,812
They don't notice us.

1446
03:15:41,980 --> 03:15:44,982
They're all asleep in their bunks.

1447
03:15:49,362 --> 03:15:51,155
No, you know what?

1448
03:15:51,573 --> 03:15:54,742
They're at the casino,
celebrating our sinking!

1449
03:16:40,705 --> 03:16:44,541
Cheers, guys!
Here's to getting home!

1450
03:17:21,329 --> 03:17:23,789
As long as the diesels hold up,

1451
03:17:27,252 --> 03:17:29,503
and with a little bit of luck,

1452
03:17:34,676 --> 03:17:36,927
we'll make it home.

1453
03:17:43,017 --> 03:17:46,687
The 3rd Submarine
Flotilla welcomes our returning sailors.

1454
03:18:20,054 --> 03:18:21,638
All engines stop.

1455
03:18:21,806 --> 03:18:23,140
Let go aft line.

1456
03:18:31,900 --> 03:18:37,237
We Build For Victory!

1457
03:18:49,167 --> 03:18:51,752
Thanks, Hinrich.
Don't mention it.

1458
03:18:51,920 --> 03:18:53,712
The sun's shining.

1459
03:18:53,880 --> 03:18:55,505
Lift it!

1460
03:19:09,354 --> 03:19:11,855
All right? Almost there.
