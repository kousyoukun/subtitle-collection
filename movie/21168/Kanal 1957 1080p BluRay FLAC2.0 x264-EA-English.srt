1
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:04,401
CANAL

2
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:07,841
1944.

3
00:03:08,601 --> 00:03:10,201
Late September.

4
00:03:10,521 --> 00:03:13,521
The Warsaw Uprising is
nearing its tragic finale.

5
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:17,721
Long have fallen the Old Town,
Powiśle, Czerniaków and Sadyba.

6
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,161
Down town, Żoliborz and Mokotów

7
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:23,441
cut off and encircled by
German forces, are in flames.

8
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:25,681
This company now numbers 43.

9
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:28,841
Three days ago there were 70.

10
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:33,281
This is their commanding officer.

11
00:03:34,641 --> 00:03:36,201
Lieutenant "Splinter".

12
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:39,081
He recruited these men,

13
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:41,281
they're his responsibility.

14
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:48,761
His second-in-command,
Lieutenant "Wise".

15
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:53,401
He instilled
iron-clad military principles.

16
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:56,721
The messenger girl, Halinka.

17
00:03:57,121 --> 00:04:00,801
She promised her mother to keep warm.

18
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:03,401
They all promised that.

19
00:04:03,681 --> 00:04:05,481
All mothers are the same.

20
00:04:06,441 --> 00:04:08,081
Sergeant "Bullet".

21
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:10,241
Perfect hand-writing,

22
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:12,361
carries all records in his case.

23
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:16,161
Officer Cadet "Ark",
wishes for a bath.

24
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,841
But the 3rd Platoon has bigger troubles.

25
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:24,361
"Slim", Ark's aide,

26
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:26,961
wants to build planes after the war.

27
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:35,841
Finally, the "Artist".

28
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:38,001
Not a soldier.

29
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:40,681
Joined yesterday.

30
00:04:48,961 --> 00:04:51,081
These are the tragic heroes.

31
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:53,281
Take a good look.

32
00:04:53,721 --> 00:04:55,521
These are their last hours.

33
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:28,761
Hi.

34
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:31,601
Hi Splinter, right on time.

35
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:33,521
What? Were you hit?

36
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:35,441
By a strong wind.

37
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:38,281
- What's the situation?
- Look.

38
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:40,201
The Stukas came.

39
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:42,321
The Germans bombed three times.

40
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:46,361
It's good they sleep at night.
No fun time here tomorrow.

41
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,281
Maybe a fun death.

42
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,721
We'll try to live here for a while.

43
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:52,561
I'd like to stay here, too.

44
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:56,081
What, until Judgement Day?

45
00:07:57,201 --> 00:08:00,001
Future generations will worship us.

46
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:02,801
They won't take us alive.

47
00:08:03,161 --> 00:08:04,641
You bet. The Polish way.

48
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:07,201
What's wrong?

49
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:08,881
You're always so strong.

50
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:11,561
I've had enough, understand?

51
00:08:12,161 --> 00:08:13,641
What am I to tell my men?

52
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:15,161
They trust me.

53
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:19,041
You're soft. No time to think here.

54
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:21,841
Bartek almost ran away today.

55
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:23,881
As if he had somewhere to go.

56
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:26,001
It's getting crowded.

57
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:29,801
They want to finish Mokotów,
start with down town.

58
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:33,481
Damn, I can't believe it's the 56th day.

59
00:08:34,401 --> 00:08:35,681
It's hell.

60
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,241
That's always an option.

61
00:08:37,561 --> 00:08:38,601
Bożena!

62
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:42,201
How are you?

63
00:08:52,321 --> 00:08:53,481
We know each other.

64
00:08:53,761 --> 00:08:55,801
You gave them to me on day one.

65
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,921
- Do they fit?
- Sure.

66
00:08:59,681 --> 00:09:02,081
To think they can pull them
off my corpse.

67
00:09:04,401 --> 00:09:07,361
But I see you joined the Uprising.
What did mom say?

68
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:13,641
She's dead.

69
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:18,281
Is your wound bad?

70
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:19,721
No, it's nothing.

71
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:22,761
It's too bad that you...

72
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:40,041
Is there a phone anywhere nearby?

73
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,041
There will be.

74
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:42,921
Can I call Rakowiecka street?

75
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:45,321
Are you crazy? The Germans are there.

76
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:48,401
I know, but... I live there.

77
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:49,881
Please let me call, OK?

78
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:51,601
Go see the commander.

79
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,841
That way?

80
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:08,241
Living in Warsaw was nice!

81
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,201
A bourgeois living room. Terrible.

82
00:10:14,801 --> 00:10:18,001
Pistols and hand grenades
against tanks and airplanes.

83
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:21,641
- When are we ever going to learn?
- Orders are orders.

84
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,601
- Ark!
- Sir?

85
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:28,121
- Put out sensors, send out a patrol.
- Yes, sir.

86
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:29,721
I need six volunteers.

87
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:31,841
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

88
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:34,921
I have a special assignment for you.

89
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:37,001
Hold on.

90
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:38,921
- You're a composer?
- Yes.

91
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:40,201
Play something nice.

92
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:41,521
- But...
- Come on.

93
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:42,841
Christ, a Bechstein!

94
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,361
Take that God damned thing off.

95
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:57,081
La Comparsita would be best.

96
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:39,921
I dreamt of you today, Halinka.

97
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:44,681
We were dancing a tango and...

98
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:49,561
Well? What's new?

99
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:52,321
Please, Lieutenant.

100
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:54,961
You promised me a gun.

101
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:57,521
Don't want to be unarmed.

102
00:11:57,681 --> 00:11:59,281
Everyone's got something.

103
00:12:00,641 --> 00:12:03,481
So tiny? I was hoping for a Luger.

104
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:06,281
It would knock you off your feet.

105
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:07,721
This is perfect.

106
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:09,681
You can kill from two metres.

107
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:15,761
Stop that noise. Play something...

108
00:12:17,121 --> 00:12:18,281
from the heart.

109
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:23,601
I could get you a real gun.

110
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:25,761
Not this cap gun.

111
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,041
Cap gun?

112
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:29,401
Yours is an antique.

113
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,681
- Is everything clear?
- Yes, sir.

114
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,601
Don't go crazy.

115
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,321
Lieutenant...

116
00:13:15,321 --> 00:13:17,001
Can I call home,

117
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:19,001
Rakowiecka street?

118
00:13:19,521 --> 00:13:21,161
My family should be there.

119
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:22,241
Can I use this?

120
00:13:24,681 --> 00:13:28,921
Just ask them to connect with 4-02-18.

121
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:32,321
All right, hold on. Let's give it a try.

122
00:13:33,321 --> 00:13:36,681
- This is Splinter. Are you alive?
- We have no windows?

123
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:39,761
You have no windows?
I forgot what they look like.

124
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:44,201
You're lucky to have a roof.
Can you put me through

125
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:48,481
to 4-02-18?
The German side. Rakowiecka.

126
00:13:48,481 --> 00:13:50,441
- None there.
- We want to check.

127
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:52,521
- I'll try.
- Okay, I'll wait.

128
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:56,041
He says there's no one there any more.

129
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:01,241
Hello?

130
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,161
Wanda?

131
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:05,441
Wanda?

132
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:08,201
- It's me, Michał.
- Michał.

133
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:11,281
How are you?

134
00:14:11,841 --> 00:14:14,361
- I've been looking for you.
- Where are you?

135
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,081
Well... the resistance.

136
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:19,441
I joined a platoon.

137
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,561
Is the Uprising still there?

138
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:25,761
I don't know how, but it's there.
What about you?

139
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,601
- They're in here.
- Evacuating?

140
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:32,441
No. They make people go to the basement
and burn...

141
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:34,281
Jesus Christ...

142
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:36,641
- Here's your girl.
- Daddy?

143
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:38,201
zosia.

144
00:14:39,601 --> 00:14:41,601
It's me, daddy.

145
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:43,241
Come back quick.

146
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:45,401
- Why are they shooting?
- Zosia.

147
00:14:48,081 --> 00:14:49,441
They're coming for us.

148
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:52,881
Wanda... hello?

149
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:06,761
Jesus.

150
00:15:06,961 --> 00:15:08,481
She hung up.

151
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:15,081
- All sensors in place.
- Thank you.

152
00:15:15,521 --> 00:15:16,521
Slim!

153
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,841
What am I supposed to do now?

154
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:20,081
Go get rest.

155
00:15:20,641 --> 00:15:21,921
Get ready for supper!

156
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:25,401
Halinka, let's find a place to sleep.

157
00:16:24,161 --> 00:16:25,401
Lieutenant.

158
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:28,241
I hereby report.

159
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:30,321
No records of Ark's platoon.

160
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:33,681
Don't bother me with your records.

161
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,841
- It's starting soon.
- But...

162
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:39,201
We must keep records.

163
00:16:39,841 --> 00:16:41,041
There will be fallen.

164
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:43,081
There will be.

165
00:16:43,681 --> 00:16:44,841
I'm sure.

166
00:16:45,281 --> 00:16:47,321
But stop bothering me now!

167
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,081
Slim!

168
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:01,641
Can you see anything?

169
00:17:03,721 --> 00:17:04,681
Nothing.

170
00:17:05,081 --> 00:17:07,921
The potato sellers have just left.

171
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:12,841
Who knows if the potatoes...

172
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:15,041
will be of any use.

173
00:17:25,361 --> 00:17:26,921
If any more Stukas come,

174
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,801
this ruin is done.

175
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:30,641
Are you ready, Ark?

176
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,601
They'll begin before eight.

177
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:33,961
I'm shaving then.

178
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:35,361
I have ten ammo clips.

179
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,161
How old are you, Ark?

180
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:38,921
23.

181
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:43,161
Life doesn't seem so precious
when you're 23.

182
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:45,081
These are the final days.

183
00:17:45,761 --> 00:17:48,361
I know. We'll make them bleed first.

184
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:51,801
Is Daisy back yet?

185
00:18:06,441 --> 00:18:07,481
What's wrong?

186
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,961
- Nothing.
- Can you use that?

187
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:13,121
Careful!

188
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,761
Are you crazy?

189
00:18:17,961 --> 00:18:19,681
That's simple.

190
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:20,641
Careful.

191
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:23,761
I'm going. Germans are finishing
breakfast.

192
00:18:26,201 --> 00:18:27,401
What are you playing?

193
00:18:39,881 --> 00:18:43,321
It's out of tune.
Too many musicians here.

194
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:05,601
I'm going.

195
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:07,441
Just don't go crazy.

196
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:09,761
Pity to lose an artist.

197
00:19:09,761 --> 00:19:11,361
What do you know?

198
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,321
Ups, sorry.

199
00:19:30,321 --> 00:19:32,721
No worries. Come in. What's this about?

200
00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:34,361
You could get up.

201
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:37,801
- No time for this.
- Watch it.

202
00:19:38,561 --> 00:19:40,401
Actually, it's time.

203
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:42,361
High time.

204
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,681
We're in love.

205
00:19:51,641 --> 00:19:52,921
And how's Daisy?

206
00:20:12,081 --> 00:20:13,201
Jacek, I'm here.

207
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:20,921
I don't stink, do I?

208
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,641
Stop wandering the canals.

209
00:20:24,321 --> 00:20:26,601
You were supposed to be back yesterday.

210
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,161
Were you worried?

211
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:33,481
I stopped worrying long ago,
Splinter asked about you.

212
00:20:34,321 --> 00:20:35,361
You jealous?

213
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:38,641
Me?

214
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:40,961
Forget it!

215
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:43,201
But you spare no one.

216
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:47,681
I'm not doing anything.
I smiled at Splinter and everyone.

217
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:49,041
Right.

218
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,921
It looked as if you had
a soft spot for him.

219
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,281
That's just the way I am.

220
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,081
That's wrong.

221
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:02,521
You should've stayed down town,
you've got...

222
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:05,921
plenty of friends there.

223
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:07,921
They're going to finish us.

224
00:21:08,281 --> 00:21:09,281
I know.

225
00:21:14,321 --> 00:21:16,201
Look at what I brought you.

226
00:21:16,681 --> 00:21:18,921
Real English tea and cigarettes.

227
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,441
You know I don't smoke?

228
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:25,521
Where did you get that?

229
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:27,481
From my aunt.

230
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:30,001
Your aunt...

231
00:21:31,841 --> 00:21:34,921
Jacek, I came back just for you.

232
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:37,441
Me?

233
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:39,601
Interesting. Why?

234
00:21:40,761 --> 00:21:42,561
- Well, why?
- Why?

235
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,281
Because I'm your messenger.

236
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:53,561
You know the main attack will be here?

237
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,521
Stop shaving, will you.

238
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:02,841
Wash up, you stink.

239
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:13,921
You sunbathed in the nude?

240
00:22:14,241 --> 00:22:17,761
I spent all of July in Zalesie.

241
00:22:18,521 --> 00:22:20,641
I came back to Warsaw on August 1st.

242
00:22:21,401 --> 00:22:24,201
Did you stay at your aunt in Zalesie?

243
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,561
It's starting.

244
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:33,841
- Get the hell out of here!
- You're stupid.

245
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:52,241
Hit it!

246
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:55,641
Left machine gun, fire lower!

247
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:16,761
Look out!

248
00:24:22,841 --> 00:24:23,881
Hello?

249
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:32,081
Bartek! Bartek! Both phones are
dead, they'll come from the back.

250
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:33,761
- Zephyr!
- Yes!

251
00:24:35,281 --> 00:24:40,641
Go to H.Q. Explain that we're holding
but the Germans are near Bartek.

252
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:42,281
We need a counter attack

253
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:43,801
or we're cut off. Go!

254
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:45,241
- Did you get that?
- Yes.

255
00:24:57,681 --> 00:24:59,561
Junk! Useless pipe!

256
00:25:00,361 --> 00:25:02,281
They'll get us in ten minutes.

257
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,081
Withdraw.

258
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:08,881
Won't stop them with bare hands!
Bloody hell!

259
00:25:14,921 --> 00:25:16,921
That's the last one, Slim...

260
00:25:31,601 --> 00:25:33,361
He hit them!

261
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:35,001
Slim hit them!

262
00:25:37,961 --> 00:25:39,161
A Goliath...

263
00:28:01,961 --> 00:28:04,881
Stop that... I'm all right.

264
00:28:25,081 --> 00:28:26,081
Keep still.

265
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:28,041
You're alright?

266
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:32,761
I'm glad you're okay.

267
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:34,561
What's happening?

268
00:28:38,761 --> 00:28:40,201
What about the platoon?

269
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,001
What are they waiting for?

270
00:28:56,521 --> 00:28:57,521
Is Zephyr back?

271
00:28:57,801 --> 00:28:58,761
No.

272
00:28:59,841 --> 00:29:01,281
They surrounded us.

273
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:07,201
How's Ark?

274
00:29:07,961 --> 00:29:09,241
He'll live.

275
00:29:10,761 --> 00:29:12,041
They wasted my men.

276
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,241
Don't get sentimental.

277
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,721
The silence is ringing in my ears.

278
00:29:59,281 --> 00:30:00,441
It's a short pause.

279
00:30:00,601 --> 00:30:02,561
They're scheming how to get us.

280
00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:05,201
The front didn't work,
they'll try at the back.

281
00:30:06,481 --> 00:30:08,601
Now is a good time to withdraw, sir.

282
00:30:12,921 --> 00:30:14,561
You never smoked before.

283
00:30:15,361 --> 00:30:16,801
Nerves?

284
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:18,521
Fear.

285
00:30:19,241 --> 00:30:20,961
This war is eating through us.

286
00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:23,681
Not me. I've been smoking
since I was a kid.

287
00:30:47,161 --> 00:30:49,161
When did you join the resistance?

288
00:30:54,281 --> 00:30:56,241
In July of 1941.

289
00:30:57,361 --> 00:30:58,361
Any medals?

290
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:02,401
The Cross of Valour

291
00:31:02,681 --> 00:31:05,121
for an attack on Blank...

292
00:31:08,281 --> 00:31:10,561
For an attack on Blank Palace.

293
00:31:10,561 --> 00:31:13,441
Wounded in the chest on the right side,

294
00:31:13,641 --> 00:31:17,241
on 26 September, 1944.

295
00:31:18,561 --> 00:31:21,641
Any next of kin in case of death?

296
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:30,641
Thank you.

297
00:31:47,361 --> 00:31:48,481
They found a way.

298
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:07,041
I don't understand...

299
00:32:07,481 --> 00:32:11,321
I've changed my mind.
I won't build planes after the war.

300
00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:12,401
Splinter.

301
00:32:12,801 --> 00:32:13,761
Splinter.

302
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:18,281
The Game is looking for you.
Something happened.

303
00:32:27,241 --> 00:32:30,561
- Sir! The company is in the Red House.
- Hello, Splinter.

304
00:32:31,561 --> 00:32:33,201
Lead us, zephyr.

305
00:32:34,561 --> 00:32:35,521
Losses?

306
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:37,841
12 dead. 10 critically wounded.

307
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:42,201
You'll leave at dusk.

308
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:43,721
We're going down town.

309
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:45,641
What? How? Which way?

310
00:32:46,201 --> 00:32:47,161
Sewer canals.

311
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:51,721
I'm not going.

312
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:53,001
Are you crazy?

313
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:56,521
Only a few streets left.
They'll finish us off tomorrow.

314
00:32:57,881 --> 00:32:59,041
I'm not going.

315
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:00,721
All that blood that was shed,

316
00:33:01,001 --> 00:33:03,641
just so that we can run away like rats?

317
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:05,161
The sewers?

318
00:33:05,921 --> 00:33:07,761
How can I look them in the face?

319
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:13,841
It's an order, Splinter.

320
00:33:14,561 --> 00:33:16,441
Screw your orders!

321
00:33:17,081 --> 00:33:18,801
You're a bloody civilian.

322
00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:22,161
You don't want to rescue your men?

323
00:33:25,681 --> 00:33:26,841
They believed me.

324
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,121
We all believed someone.

325
00:33:33,401 --> 00:33:35,401
Here's your pass.

326
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:36,881
To the canals.

327
00:33:38,201 --> 00:33:39,521
Take care, Splinter.

328
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:55,321
Gentlemen, why is it so quiet in here?

329
00:33:55,561 --> 00:33:56,841
Play the gramophone.

330
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:04,761
Stop that.

331
00:34:06,521 --> 00:34:07,481
Stop that.

332
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:09,961
Should play an entire symphony.

333
00:34:09,961 --> 00:34:11,281
Here, you try.

334
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:18,321
On this thing?

335
00:34:21,001 --> 00:34:23,081
Smartass...

336
00:34:31,681 --> 00:34:33,321
Listen up, kids.

337
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:37,041
- Good news.
- Reinforcements?

338
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:41,681
We're going down town.

339
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:44,081
Through the sewers.

340
00:34:45,881 --> 00:34:46,881
What?

341
00:34:48,481 --> 00:34:49,681
We're leaving?

342
00:34:49,961 --> 00:34:51,601
We can't hold Mokotów.

343
00:34:53,161 --> 00:34:54,681
Only a few streets left.

344
00:34:56,241 --> 00:35:00,201
- They'll crush us.
- Hear that?

345
00:35:00,481 --> 00:35:02,481
We were crammed here for nothing!

346
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:31,601
It's an order from headquarters.

347
00:35:47,761 --> 00:35:48,721
Nothing.

348
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:52,681
Blank. I'm making hollow sounds.

349
00:35:54,961 --> 00:35:56,761
Don't drink any more, please.

350
00:36:00,721 --> 00:36:02,321
I'm an impotent, understand?

351
00:36:02,881 --> 00:36:04,041
A labourer.

352
00:36:09,441 --> 00:36:10,881
That's the real tragedy.

353
00:36:18,681 --> 00:36:21,681
- Don't drink.
- I'm glad this misery is ending.

354
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:24,881
Give it to me. I want some, too.

355
00:36:36,721 --> 00:36:38,921
The handsome soldier loves you, right?

356
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:40,241
Is he your first?

357
00:36:42,561 --> 00:36:45,241
I feel we won't make it
through this night.

358
00:36:47,721 --> 00:36:50,001
It's easier to die when you're in love.

359
00:36:52,081 --> 00:36:53,041
Nonsense!

360
00:36:54,321 --> 00:36:55,281
Drama!

361
00:37:00,441 --> 00:37:01,881
Don't get carried away.

362
00:37:04,481 --> 00:37:06,801
Make room for the company commander!

363
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:08,961
- Drink Splinter.
- You're mad.

364
00:37:09,881 --> 00:37:11,321
You too, Halinka?

365
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:14,521
I'm not drinking, listening to music.

366
00:37:14,761 --> 00:37:16,881
Music? Now you want music?

367
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,961
And you're playing!

368
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:20,521
It's the last time.

369
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:21,641
Drink, Splinter.

370
00:37:21,841 --> 00:37:23,961
It'll be easier to cross the sewers.

371
00:37:25,281 --> 00:37:26,921
This is your discipline?

372
00:37:27,281 --> 00:37:29,041
Hold the fort until the end.

373
00:37:29,401 --> 00:37:30,521
Only drunk.

374
00:37:31,281 --> 00:37:33,361
It's a long way to down town.

375
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:35,721
Plenty of time to sober up.

376
00:37:36,281 --> 00:37:37,281
And then what?

377
00:37:37,761 --> 00:37:39,241
We'll keep on fighting.

378
00:37:41,881 --> 00:37:42,921
Fighting?

379
00:37:43,481 --> 00:37:45,041
They'll crush us like bugs.

380
00:37:45,601 --> 00:37:47,041
This city is done.

381
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:49,041
Shut up! Can't you die like a man?

382
00:37:51,641 --> 00:37:53,201
Only now I know how to die.

383
00:37:59,441 --> 00:38:01,321
- Company muster call.
- Yes, sir.

384
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:04,521
But now it's a platoon, not a company.

385
00:38:07,761 --> 00:38:10,681
Don't you dare to fart once we start.

386
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:14,001
Quiet like in a family tomb.

387
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:17,321
Otherwise, Germans will end us.

388
00:38:19,561 --> 00:38:21,121
You afraid?

389
00:38:21,481 --> 00:38:22,681
Come to me,

390
00:38:23,081 --> 00:38:24,881
I'll hold your hand.

391
00:38:25,561 --> 00:38:27,441
Come on, cheer up!

392
00:38:27,961 --> 00:38:29,361
Old geezers.

393
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:30,641
Attention!

394
00:38:35,441 --> 00:38:38,201
The company is ready to depart.

395
00:38:38,481 --> 00:38:41,801
Two officers, five deputies
and twenty shooters.

396
00:38:41,961 --> 00:38:43,441
That's not a muster call.

397
00:38:43,761 --> 00:38:44,721
Thank you.

398
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:46,361
Thank you. At ease!

399
00:38:47,121 --> 00:38:48,241
Forward march!

400
00:39:01,321 --> 00:39:02,761
Can you make it, Ark?

401
00:39:02,921 --> 00:39:04,801
Sure. Give it to me.

402
00:39:05,841 --> 00:39:07,921
Let me try, I'm not risking much.

403
00:39:09,321 --> 00:39:11,161
He needs two strong men.

404
00:39:15,841 --> 00:39:17,441
I'll guide him, don't worry.

405
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:19,081
You come with me.

406
00:39:19,921 --> 00:39:21,321
You'll show us the way.

407
00:39:21,721 --> 00:39:23,081
It's easy.

408
00:39:24,241 --> 00:39:25,881
Please, let me go with him.

409
00:40:39,241 --> 00:40:41,441
Wise, don't fire until we cross.

410
00:42:40,921 --> 00:42:41,881
Tiger tanks.

411
00:43:23,641 --> 00:43:25,401
This is the last barricade.

412
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:28,041
- Get in the sewers, friend.
- Lieutenant...

413
00:43:28,361 --> 00:43:32,481
- I report it's our turn...
- Report respectfully into the hole.

414
00:43:32,481 --> 00:43:33,881
You little...

415
00:44:03,081 --> 00:44:05,961
Sir, have you seen my daughter?
She's blonde...

416
00:44:05,961 --> 00:44:09,641
- Let's go!
- Gentlemen, wait! Please wait!

417
00:44:09,641 --> 00:44:13,361
She is blonde and tall in a brown coat.

418
00:44:13,361 --> 00:44:17,361
Brown coat, brown coat.

419
00:44:22,561 --> 00:44:24,361
Gentlemen!

420
00:44:27,161 --> 00:44:28,641
Have mercy!

421
00:44:29,561 --> 00:44:33,001
Don't leave us! Don't leave us!

422
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:35,641
Don't go! Don't go!

423
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:30,721
- What happened?
- Crap!

424
00:45:30,721 --> 00:45:32,761
Oh, God, the acoustics is amazing!

425
00:45:33,241 --> 00:45:36,361
"A land of heavy dreams and shadows."

426
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:39,201
- Stop chatting and move on, Maestro!
- Quiet!

427
00:45:39,841 --> 00:45:43,801
- No talking!
- I'm too tall for... God damn it.

428
00:45:47,001 --> 00:45:48,321
You're lucky, Halinka.

429
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,201
Gas! Gas!

430
00:45:58,201 --> 00:46:01,921
- Go on!
- No! No! Gas!

431
00:46:02,081 --> 00:46:04,121
Germans! Gas!

432
00:46:06,161 --> 00:46:08,801
Wise, let's turn back. There's gas.

433
00:46:09,761 --> 00:46:11,881
Germans must be up there already.

434
00:46:11,881 --> 00:46:14,041
We have to catch up with the company.

435
00:46:20,481 --> 00:46:21,561
Stop!

436
00:46:21,881 --> 00:46:23,401
Germans have released gas!

437
00:46:23,641 --> 00:46:24,801
That way back?

438
00:46:24,801 --> 00:46:25,841
I think so.

439
00:46:28,001 --> 00:46:30,601
But who knows? All sewers look alike!

440
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:41,401
I'm from the Old Town.

441
00:46:41,921 --> 00:46:45,681
I've had enough of canals
and this stupid game of hide-and-seek!

442
00:47:29,641 --> 00:47:31,041
Go back, there's gas!

443
00:47:31,681 --> 00:47:33,561
Where are you going?

444
00:47:33,921 --> 00:47:34,921
Hey!

445
00:48:01,161 --> 00:48:02,801
My head's spinning.

446
00:48:05,601 --> 00:48:06,961
It must be the gas.

447
00:48:06,961 --> 00:48:08,281
It's the fever.

448
00:48:08,721 --> 00:48:10,001
There's no gas here.

449
00:48:11,561 --> 00:48:13,361
We're never going to catch up.

450
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,361
Maybe we should call Michał?

451
00:48:16,921 --> 00:48:18,521
There's no need.

452
00:48:18,881 --> 00:48:20,321
I know this sewer.

453
00:48:21,361 --> 00:48:22,921
It's an easy way.

454
00:48:24,281 --> 00:48:26,001
We'll make it step by step.

455
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:33,881
I'm going to rest.

456
00:48:33,881 --> 00:48:35,041
Keep going, damn it!

457
00:48:36,721 --> 00:48:37,841
Let's go.

458
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,481
You'll rest at home.

459
00:48:41,281 --> 00:48:42,401
Home...

460
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:44,601
Who still has a home?

461
00:48:51,641 --> 00:48:53,761
You're really strong.

462
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,121
Like a labourer.

463
00:48:57,441 --> 00:48:59,081
I've never been a labourer.

464
00:49:03,281 --> 00:49:05,161
I know nothing about you.

465
00:49:08,361 --> 00:49:10,601
We fought in the resistance together.

466
00:49:12,641 --> 00:49:14,641
I know that, but...

467
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:19,401
Should I tell you the story of my life?

468
00:49:21,281 --> 00:49:22,561
Is it long?

469
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,321
Longer than this sewer.

470
00:49:31,321 --> 00:49:32,321
Keep walking.

471
00:49:49,641 --> 00:49:50,601
Jacek!

472
00:49:51,041 --> 00:49:52,001
Jacek!

473
00:49:58,201 --> 00:49:59,161
What's that?

474
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:05,801
Look...

475
00:50:07,081 --> 00:50:08,761
Is it a lamp at the crossing?

476
00:50:10,361 --> 00:50:11,481
Maybe the Germans?

477
00:50:12,441 --> 00:50:14,121
They wouldn't come down here.

478
00:50:14,961 --> 00:50:16,041
You think?

479
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:18,081
Definitely.

480
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:46,721
Jacek, it's just a candle.

481
00:50:49,481 --> 00:50:51,241
This is the first barricade.

482
00:50:51,241 --> 00:50:52,721
You can rest.

483
00:51:01,401 --> 00:51:03,961
- Help me carry a wounded man!
- Be quiet.

484
00:51:14,881 --> 00:51:16,281
What are you staring at?

485
00:51:45,361 --> 00:51:47,921
Quiet! Germans above!

486
00:51:51,081 --> 00:51:53,721
Quiet, motherfucker!

487
00:52:12,081 --> 00:52:13,241
It's seven already.

488
00:52:23,681 --> 00:52:24,881
The sun is up.

489
00:52:29,721 --> 00:52:31,001
Get Lieutenant Wise.

490
00:52:33,521 --> 00:52:35,561
Wise, report to Splinter.

491
00:52:36,801 --> 00:52:38,921
Wise, report to Splinter.

492
00:52:40,601 --> 00:52:43,041
Wise, report to Splinter.

493
00:52:43,601 --> 00:52:45,081
Gas!

494
00:52:47,521 --> 00:52:48,681
Jesus Christ...

495
00:52:52,561 --> 00:52:55,281
It'll be difficult to maintain
discipline here.

496
00:52:56,801 --> 00:52:58,201
But we must.

497
00:52:58,201 --> 00:52:59,401
What are we doing?

498
00:52:59,641 --> 00:53:01,041
Let's wait for Wise.

499
00:53:01,321 --> 00:53:02,921
We can't leave them behind.

500
00:53:21,001 --> 00:53:22,601
Damned matches!

501
00:53:22,921 --> 00:53:24,641
It's not the matches, sir.

502
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:27,881
Too many feet stirred this crap.
Fumes are released.

503
00:53:28,921 --> 00:53:31,041
This is killing us, not the grenades.

504
00:53:31,801 --> 00:53:33,721
I know chemistry a bit.

505
00:53:34,161 --> 00:53:36,081
Do you feel dizzy?

506
00:53:36,361 --> 00:53:37,321
No.

507
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:39,761
But there's no oxygen in the air.

508
00:53:40,601 --> 00:53:42,201
Let's get out of here.

509
00:53:43,801 --> 00:53:45,401
Well, Lieutenant?

510
00:53:45,401 --> 00:53:47,641
Do we let the men die like this?

511
00:53:48,161 --> 00:53:49,801
Is it my fault?

512
00:53:50,241 --> 00:53:51,721
Why isn't Wise here, yet?

513
00:53:52,041 --> 00:53:53,041
Call him!

514
00:53:55,281 --> 00:53:56,321
Don't sit down!

515
00:53:56,801 --> 00:53:58,321
It's worse near the water.

516
00:53:58,601 --> 00:54:00,241
You won't be able to get up.

517
00:54:00,961 --> 00:54:03,201
I can't. I feel sick.

518
00:54:11,801 --> 00:54:13,041
Let's go, Lieutenant.

519
00:54:13,241 --> 00:54:14,641
We can't stay here.

520
00:54:21,121 --> 00:54:22,121
I'll go.

521
00:54:23,921 --> 00:54:24,921
I'll call them.

522
00:55:21,321 --> 00:55:23,601
Wise says we should continue.

523
00:55:25,241 --> 00:55:29,321
They stopped so that Ark could rest.

524
00:55:30,801 --> 00:55:32,281
Daisy knows the way.

525
00:55:33,641 --> 00:55:35,121
They'll catch up with us.

526
00:55:38,721 --> 00:55:40,041
Let's go.

527
00:55:48,921 --> 00:55:50,001
Let's go, guys.

528
00:56:13,521 --> 00:56:15,761
- Slow down, Wise.
- Faster!

529
00:56:16,961 --> 00:56:19,761
Splinter is probably out on Aleje Street
by now.

530
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:23,081
Give me the flask.

531
00:56:24,961 --> 00:56:26,721
- You'll get weaker.
- Give it!

532
00:56:45,241 --> 00:56:46,401
You want some?

533
00:56:46,401 --> 00:56:49,401
Sure. It's cold. I'm tired.

534
00:56:52,161 --> 00:56:53,201
Enough already.

535
00:56:55,521 --> 00:56:57,121
It's the Waters of Lethe.

536
00:56:57,121 --> 00:56:59,201
River of Oblivion.

537
00:56:59,841 --> 00:57:02,961
It's just moonshine.
Picks you up, doesn't it?

538
00:57:06,321 --> 00:57:08,001
Did you hear these sounds?

539
00:57:14,121 --> 00:57:15,601
Come on Artist, hurry!

540
00:57:16,561 --> 00:57:17,721
Jesus! What is that?

541
00:57:18,241 --> 00:57:19,481
Wise!

542
00:57:19,721 --> 00:57:22,441
Jesus!

543
00:57:34,641 --> 00:57:36,121
Are you okay, Halinka?

544
00:57:37,601 --> 00:57:39,481
Witold!

545
00:57:39,761 --> 00:57:43,521
- Where are you? Where's my child?
- Shut up, damned woman!

546
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:46,401
You sold us out! Murderers!

547
00:57:47,161 --> 00:57:48,521
What are you doing?

548
00:57:51,921 --> 00:57:52,881
Open it!

549
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:54,721
Open it!

550
00:58:02,681 --> 00:58:04,721
- Let me through!
- Marian!

551
00:58:06,641 --> 00:58:08,601
Let me through! I'll open it.

552
00:58:13,721 --> 00:58:16,361
"Thither we came, and thence
down in the moat

553
00:58:17,081 --> 00:58:22,121
I saw a people smothered in a filth

554
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:27,921
That out of human privies
seemed to flow"

555
00:58:28,481 --> 00:58:31,521
- What are you saying?
- It's not me, it's Dante.

556
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:43,521
I can't open it!

557
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:45,801
Get down here at once!

558
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:48,161
You'll draw the Germans' attention!

559
00:58:54,161 --> 00:58:55,121
Faster!

560
00:58:59,081 --> 00:59:03,481
- Wise. Let's save us! I'm scared.
- Stop whining!

561
00:59:03,481 --> 00:59:05,521
Think don't want to? Let's go back.

562
00:59:48,801 --> 00:59:50,241
You look bad, Jacek.

563
00:59:50,761 --> 00:59:52,441
You can shave when we're out.

564
00:59:54,561 --> 00:59:56,241
I don't care.

565
00:59:57,001 --> 00:59:58,521
You must be very ill.

566
01:00:05,241 --> 01:00:06,201
What's that?

567
01:00:13,161 --> 01:00:14,161
Rain?

568
01:00:14,481 --> 01:00:15,881
That's rain.

569
01:00:16,761 --> 01:00:17,721
Quiet.

570
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,281
Don't cry, child.

571
01:00:20,401 --> 01:00:21,401
Listen.

572
01:00:22,561 --> 01:00:24,121
Don't you hear...

573
01:00:25,241 --> 01:00:28,441
Everything 's singing.

574
01:00:28,961 --> 01:00:30,961
Yeah, you're seeing angels?

575
01:00:31,681 --> 01:00:33,521
- Get up! Get moving!
- Quiet!

576
01:00:35,241 --> 01:00:37,201
Can you hear it?

577
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,481
Nonsense! It's just the water!

578
01:00:42,081 --> 01:00:43,041
I hear it.

579
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:45,601
I can finally hear it.

580
01:00:46,721 --> 01:00:47,721
You know?

581
01:00:49,721 --> 01:00:50,801
I hear.

582
01:01:06,841 --> 01:01:08,441
Shut up! Damn you!

583
01:01:13,281 --> 01:01:14,241
What's with you?

584
01:01:14,401 --> 01:01:15,681
Are you mad!

585
01:01:27,521 --> 01:01:29,921
Funny little man.

586
01:01:32,721 --> 01:01:34,121
You can't understand.

587
01:01:35,001 --> 01:01:36,681
Come back! Don't be an idiot!

588
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:43,281
Stop, or I'll shoot!

589
01:01:58,801 --> 01:02:00,521
Come back, it's an order!

590
01:02:03,681 --> 01:02:04,721
Wise...

591
01:02:06,081 --> 01:02:07,281
Why am I so weak?

592
01:02:11,441 --> 01:02:12,921
We won't reach down town.

593
01:02:13,961 --> 01:02:14,921
There's no way.

594
01:02:17,121 --> 01:02:19,121
The sewer has to end somewhere!

595
01:02:20,561 --> 01:02:21,561
Let's go.

596
01:02:36,281 --> 01:02:37,241
What is that?

597
01:02:39,361 --> 01:02:40,761
Probably a wounded man.

598
01:02:41,161 --> 01:02:44,041
Could that really be a human voice?

599
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:47,681
Let's go.

600
01:02:47,921 --> 01:02:51,561
Sir, we can't make anything
out of these noises.

601
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:54,321
I'll go look. Wait here.

602
01:03:31,481 --> 01:03:32,921
I found your noise-maker.

603
01:03:57,121 --> 01:03:58,401
A man.

604
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:00,001
Let's get out of here, sir.

605
01:04:00,481 --> 01:04:01,601
I know him.

606
01:04:01,801 --> 01:04:04,641
It's the Colonel from Headquarters.

607
01:04:06,361 --> 01:04:08,201
Which one will carry him?

608
01:04:29,121 --> 01:04:30,161
What's wrong?

609
01:04:45,321 --> 01:04:46,401
Forward march!

610
01:05:09,321 --> 01:05:10,841
Where do we turn?

611
01:05:12,161 --> 01:05:16,441
There should be a sign for Wilcza street
here, on the left.

612
01:05:16,441 --> 01:05:18,361
We should have brought Daisy.

613
01:05:18,721 --> 01:05:19,801
She knows the way.

614
01:05:20,561 --> 01:05:22,201
Daisy is helping Ark...

615
01:05:23,881 --> 01:05:25,361
and we know how to read.

616
01:05:25,561 --> 01:05:27,321
I can't take this, Lieutenant.

617
01:05:27,601 --> 01:05:29,921
Let get out or we'll stay here forever.

618
01:05:33,641 --> 01:05:35,441
There are no signs.

619
01:05:38,481 --> 01:05:39,921
Call the men, Bullet.

620
01:05:39,921 --> 01:05:40,881
Yes, sir!

621
01:05:41,761 --> 01:05:42,721
Lieutenant...

622
01:05:57,161 --> 01:05:58,441
Get up!

623
01:05:58,641 --> 01:06:00,321
The Lieutenant is waiting!

624
01:06:00,961 --> 01:06:02,601
Go on ahead.

625
01:06:02,881 --> 01:06:04,281
Wait a moment.

626
01:06:05,001 --> 01:06:06,441
I'm weak.

627
01:06:06,641 --> 01:06:07,841
We'll rest for a bit.

628
01:06:35,441 --> 01:06:36,761
There!

629
01:06:46,761 --> 01:06:48,361
There should be...

630
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:51,041
a sign here... Wilcza.

631
01:06:52,561 --> 01:06:53,521
Wilcza...

632
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:00,761
No. There's no sign.

633
01:07:19,241 --> 01:07:21,161
- Well?
- They're coming.

634
01:07:23,241 --> 01:07:25,201
Hold on to me, Splinter.

635
01:07:33,681 --> 01:07:35,161
I've had enough of this.

636
01:07:46,281 --> 01:07:47,841
Just keep moving your legs.

637
01:07:50,161 --> 01:07:51,161
Daisy...

638
01:07:52,561 --> 01:07:53,801
aren't you tired?

639
01:07:54,281 --> 01:07:55,601
Why should I be tired?

640
01:07:56,161 --> 01:07:57,281
I'm not wounded.

641
01:08:01,161 --> 01:08:02,881
It's calm and misty.

642
01:08:04,441 --> 01:08:08,481
We're walking through
a dark and fragrant forest.

643
01:08:09,641 --> 01:08:12,081
We're stumbling
through stinking shit.

644
01:08:15,961 --> 01:08:20,201
You're always down to earth.

645
01:08:21,281 --> 01:08:22,241
No...

646
01:08:25,001 --> 01:08:27,081
You could never fall in love.

647
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:34,161
Keep moving your legs,

648
01:08:35,961 --> 01:08:37,841
or we'll be here for days.

649
01:08:38,561 --> 01:08:40,201
You have a fever,

650
01:08:40,441 --> 01:08:42,081
and we'll die of hunger.

651
01:08:49,441 --> 01:08:50,481
What's wrong?

652
01:08:53,041 --> 01:08:54,081
My heart...

653
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:01,081
What's that?

654
01:09:10,601 --> 01:09:11,641
He was old.

655
01:09:13,281 --> 01:09:16,681
He probably died during the gas panic.

656
01:09:18,201 --> 01:09:20,641
Stupid people, first time in the sewers.

657
01:09:42,841 --> 01:09:43,881
Nothing.

658
01:09:44,961 --> 01:09:45,921
I see nothing.

659
01:09:50,521 --> 01:09:53,041
There it is! The sign!

660
01:10:00,801 --> 01:10:02,041
I...

661
01:10:02,361 --> 01:10:05,881
love... Jacek.

662
01:10:07,481 --> 01:10:08,441
Oh, God.

663
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:40,841
My head's spinning.

664
01:10:43,841 --> 01:10:45,481
I think there's gas here.

665
01:10:47,521 --> 01:10:48,801
Look at the fog.

666
01:10:50,521 --> 01:10:51,841
You're a child.

667
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:53,881
It's the fever talking.

668
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:00,401
Wait.

669
01:11:00,801 --> 01:11:02,241
Our sewer.

670
01:11:02,561 --> 01:11:03,681
See?

671
01:11:04,201 --> 01:11:05,161
Wilcza.

672
01:11:13,881 --> 01:11:15,881
I wouldn't have noticed it.

673
01:11:18,201 --> 01:11:19,201
I can barely see.

674
01:11:20,241 --> 01:11:21,521
Let's go up there.

675
01:11:22,161 --> 01:11:23,521
Give me your hand.

676
01:12:07,201 --> 01:12:08,241
Your hand...

677
01:12:13,961 --> 01:12:15,681
- Hold on to me!
- Jacek!

678
01:12:23,521 --> 01:12:25,321
I can't go up that pipe!

679
01:12:25,881 --> 01:12:26,921
I can't reach it.

680
01:12:28,321 --> 01:12:29,721
Go by yourself.

681
01:12:34,201 --> 01:12:35,361
You idiot!

682
01:12:38,961 --> 01:12:40,481
You can't pull me up.

683
01:12:41,321 --> 01:12:43,201
You should go and get help.

684
01:12:44,161 --> 01:12:45,921
I'll just rest here and wait.

685
01:12:52,041 --> 01:12:53,881
Look there's a sign over there.

686
01:12:54,841 --> 01:12:55,841
Large letters...

687
01:12:58,481 --> 01:13:00,681
I love...

688
01:13:01,641 --> 01:13:03,441
We have to save the batteries.

689
01:13:03,641 --> 01:13:05,441
There's a sign there.

690
01:13:06,001 --> 01:13:07,241
What does it say?

691
01:13:09,401 --> 01:13:11,041
I love...

692
01:13:12,281 --> 01:13:13,561
Janek.

693
01:13:15,521 --> 01:13:17,761
Who could have written such nonsense?

694
01:13:18,921 --> 01:13:20,321
It's not nonsense.

695
01:13:21,881 --> 01:13:23,001
An empty sewer.

696
01:13:23,881 --> 01:13:26,361
Germans high above. It's fear, you know?

697
01:13:28,041 --> 01:13:29,041
You wrote it.

698
01:13:29,601 --> 01:13:30,641
And felt better.

699
01:13:31,921 --> 01:13:33,361
I used to walk here, too.

700
01:13:33,881 --> 01:13:35,921
And what did you write?

701
01:13:38,841 --> 01:13:40,401
Kiss my ass...

702
01:13:40,401 --> 01:13:42,521
- What?
- And things like that.

703
01:13:44,561 --> 01:13:46,201
And who's...

704
01:13:48,041 --> 01:13:49,281
this Janek?

705
01:13:50,921 --> 01:13:52,561
A guy that some girl loved.

706
01:13:53,481 --> 01:13:54,441
Loved him a lot?

707
01:13:56,961 --> 01:13:58,041
A lot.

708
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:00,961
A lot, Jacek.

709
01:14:01,881 --> 01:14:03,601
Come on, let's go.

710
01:14:03,961 --> 01:14:05,361
No.

711
01:14:05,361 --> 01:14:07,081
We can't go up.

712
01:14:07,601 --> 01:14:09,481
I'll rest and wait here.

713
01:14:10,401 --> 01:14:12,801
You'll come back with help, right?

714
01:14:13,281 --> 01:14:14,281
Get up!

715
01:14:14,801 --> 01:14:15,841
No.

716
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:27,841
I must have imagined it...

717
01:14:32,721 --> 01:14:35,121
I'm so dizzy now.

718
01:14:36,161 --> 01:14:37,561
I can hear music.

719
01:14:40,921 --> 01:14:42,961
Must be the fever...

720
01:14:45,561 --> 01:14:47,441
Wait, I can really hear it.

721
01:15:14,481 --> 01:15:15,641
Who was that?

722
01:15:18,761 --> 01:15:20,481
Is he crazy, or am I?

723
01:15:21,201 --> 01:15:22,561
He is! Remember?

724
01:15:29,841 --> 01:15:31,561
I don't remember anything.

725
01:15:40,241 --> 01:15:41,201
Michał.

726
01:15:42,161 --> 01:15:43,121
Michał.

727
01:15:45,161 --> 01:15:46,121
Michał!

728
01:15:46,881 --> 01:15:48,001
Come back!

729
01:16:00,881 --> 01:16:02,361
Quiet.

730
01:16:03,441 --> 01:16:05,001
He can't hear anything.

731
01:16:08,121 --> 01:16:09,601
Jacek.

732
01:16:10,561 --> 01:16:12,481
Stop whining...

733
01:16:13,081 --> 01:16:14,161
and let's go!

734
01:16:15,361 --> 01:16:16,841
I won't make it up there,

735
01:16:18,401 --> 01:16:19,761
but I want to live.

736
01:16:23,281 --> 01:16:24,521
That's good.

737
01:16:24,961 --> 01:16:26,601
Don't worry, you'll live.

738
01:16:28,761 --> 01:16:29,801
We'll go straight.

739
01:16:30,601 --> 01:16:33,561
This ends up at Vistula river soon.

740
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:47,201
It's dry here.

741
01:16:48,041 --> 01:16:49,401
There's an exit nearby.

742
01:16:50,041 --> 01:16:51,401
Turn on the flash light.

743
01:16:52,081 --> 01:16:53,601
The battery's almost dead.

744
01:16:53,881 --> 01:16:55,281
We'll get there anyway.

745
01:17:05,401 --> 01:17:06,481
That's impossible.

746
01:17:09,881 --> 01:17:11,281
I have no strength left.

747
01:17:12,401 --> 01:17:13,681
We'll never get out.

748
01:17:14,561 --> 01:17:16,001
- It's over.
- Over?

749
01:17:16,921 --> 01:17:18,321
It can't be over!

750
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:21,161
I have someone to live for!

751
01:17:21,161 --> 01:17:22,561
I'm right here.

752
01:17:22,801 --> 01:17:26,521
- Who do you live for?
- What? I have a wife and a child!

753
01:17:27,201 --> 01:17:28,681
A wife and a child?

754
01:17:29,721 --> 01:17:32,641
It's funny, you never mentioned.

755
01:17:34,161 --> 01:17:35,881
You never wore a wedding ring.

756
01:17:36,761 --> 01:17:39,161
What? I have it on me.

757
01:17:41,201 --> 01:17:42,241
Look!

758
01:17:45,561 --> 01:17:46,521
See?

759
01:17:47,081 --> 01:17:48,081
I have to live.

760
01:17:48,561 --> 01:17:51,081
Let's go back. We'll go up.

761
01:17:51,241 --> 01:17:53,281
Hurry, while I'm still on my feet.

762
01:17:54,201 --> 01:17:55,241
Hold on.

763
01:17:57,601 --> 01:17:59,161
Turn off the light, Wise.

764
01:17:59,521 --> 01:18:00,721
Get up!

765
01:18:28,361 --> 01:18:29,321
Daisy...

766
01:18:29,961 --> 01:18:31,401
I need to sit down.

767
01:18:31,401 --> 01:18:32,401
No.

768
01:18:32,761 --> 01:18:33,921
I have to.

769
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:37,601
I have to rest.

770
01:18:38,921 --> 01:18:41,401
Jacek, we'll be at the river soon.

771
01:18:43,921 --> 01:18:44,881
No.

772
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,601
I can't open my eyes.

773
01:18:48,601 --> 01:18:49,681
It hurts.

774
01:18:50,401 --> 01:18:51,641
Then don't.

775
01:18:51,961 --> 01:18:53,401
It's the fever.

776
01:18:54,961 --> 01:18:57,081
You'll stay at the hospital.

777
01:18:57,761 --> 01:18:59,281
Where's this hospital?

778
01:19:15,961 --> 01:19:17,481
You think...

779
01:19:17,721 --> 01:19:20,401
there's no more life out there?

780
01:19:23,121 --> 01:19:24,121
No more...

781
01:19:25,161 --> 01:19:26,281
Jacek.

782
01:19:28,361 --> 01:19:29,361
Life.

783
01:19:30,241 --> 01:19:31,561
Daisy...

784
01:19:32,321 --> 01:19:33,481
I promised you that.

785
01:19:34,521 --> 01:19:36,441
I was so rude to you...

786
01:19:36,801 --> 01:19:38,561
We'll talk about that later.

787
01:19:40,081 --> 01:19:41,521
I've been bad.

788
01:19:58,601 --> 01:20:00,041
I can see the light.

789
01:20:21,081 --> 01:20:22,361
We're going to live.

790
01:21:03,521 --> 01:21:05,561
Don't open your eyes. It's bright.

791
01:21:08,721 --> 01:21:10,601
Is it much further?

792
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:35,121
I see water.

793
01:21:35,841 --> 01:21:37,241
And green grass.

794
01:21:39,161 --> 01:21:40,521
Let's go there.

795
01:21:41,561 --> 01:21:42,921
Daisy...

796
01:21:47,641 --> 01:21:48,721
You can rest now.

797
01:21:52,361 --> 01:21:53,921
We'll go to the grass soon.

798
01:21:56,201 --> 01:21:57,161
No...

799
01:21:58,001 --> 01:22:00,041
Don't open your eyes because...

800
01:22:02,561 --> 01:22:04,881
Because the sun's come out.

801
01:23:16,201 --> 01:23:17,241
Hands up!

802
01:24:08,921 --> 01:24:10,401
Give the wedding ring.

803
01:24:44,761 --> 01:24:46,921
Come out!

804
01:25:01,841 --> 01:25:06,561
Slim, throw that damned gun away.
People have to move out.

805
01:25:06,561 --> 01:25:09,801
- You're killing yourself.
- I'm stunned, damn.

806
01:25:10,961 --> 01:25:13,801
Throw it away. Let's get some air.

807
01:25:14,241 --> 01:25:16,241
- And fast.
- Get lost!

808
01:25:18,681 --> 01:25:19,881
Light!

809
01:25:21,081 --> 01:25:22,881
Air, sir!

810
01:25:27,801 --> 01:25:31,241
We're going to the inlet.
Tell the men, Bullet.

811
01:25:31,681 --> 01:25:32,761
The inlet.

812
01:25:33,841 --> 01:25:35,641
We're turning left, guys.

813
01:25:36,001 --> 01:25:37,201
Going to the inlet.

814
01:25:51,561 --> 01:25:53,121
They're coming, Lieutenant.

815
01:25:54,761 --> 01:25:55,761
They're coming.

816
01:26:10,801 --> 01:26:11,801
No way.

817
01:26:12,761 --> 01:26:13,761
It's blocked.

818
01:26:22,881 --> 01:26:24,081
We're turning back.

819
01:26:27,641 --> 01:26:28,961
We've got the strength.

820
01:26:30,081 --> 01:26:31,801
I have to get my men out!

821
01:26:31,801 --> 01:26:32,761
Air...

822
01:26:32,961 --> 01:26:35,161
Sir, we have to get some air.

823
01:26:35,521 --> 01:26:36,841
It's death back there.

824
01:26:41,601 --> 01:26:43,521
They've hung grenades, bastards.

825
01:26:45,841 --> 01:26:47,121
Wait.

826
01:28:04,161 --> 01:28:05,121
Good.

827
01:28:11,641 --> 01:28:13,921
One more, and we're on our way.

828
01:28:38,841 --> 01:28:40,481
Let's go, sir.

829
01:28:40,921 --> 01:28:42,041
Let's go, sir.

830
01:29:57,841 --> 01:29:59,761
Thank you, Holy Mother...

831
01:30:02,761 --> 01:30:03,841
Lieutenant...

832
01:30:04,921 --> 01:30:06,321
Where are we?

833
01:30:17,361 --> 01:30:18,921
Why aren't they coming out?

834
01:30:20,281 --> 01:30:21,681
Call them, Bullet.

835
01:30:23,241 --> 01:30:24,841
We're safe.

836
01:30:25,681 --> 01:30:27,281
We're out!

837
01:30:28,281 --> 01:30:30,041
Let's go, sir.

838
01:30:35,121 --> 01:30:38,281
Bullet, call them.
They could have walked too far.

839
01:30:38,961 --> 01:30:42,081
They... stayed behind a long time ago.

840
01:30:42,681 --> 01:30:45,241
I only pretended they were behind us.

841
01:30:49,081 --> 01:30:50,161
You bastard!

842
01:30:53,561 --> 01:30:54,841
What about my company!

843
01:30:56,601 --> 01:30:58,921
They're still there?!

844
01:31:07,721 --> 01:31:09,081
My company...

845
01:31:10,961 --> 01:31:12,321
My company...

846
01:31:18,681 --> 01:31:21,921
My company...
