1944.
Late September.

8
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,900
The Warsaw Uprising is
nearing its tragic finale.

9
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,900
The towns of Riverside,
Czerniakow and Sadyba

10
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,900
have fallen
long ago.

11
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,900
The downtown areas of
Zoliborz and Mokotow,

12
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,900
cut off and surrounded by
German forces, are in flames.

13
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,900
This company
now numbers 43.

14
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,900
Three days ago,
there were 70.

15
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:59,900
This is their commanding
officer, Lieutenant "Splinter".

16
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,700
He recruited these men, and
is responsible for them.

17
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,900
His second-in-command,
Lieutenant "Wise",

18
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,900
drilled discipline into these
boys with an iron hand

19
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,900
And the messenger
girl, Halinka.

20
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,900
Leaving home, she promised
her mother she would keep warm.

21
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,900
They've most likely all made
the same promise.

22
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,900
All mothers
are alike.

23
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,900
Sergeant Major "Bullet",
has perfect hand-writing,

24
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,900
and carries all of
the records in his case.

25
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,900
Officer Cadet "Bearing"
dreams of his daily bath.

26
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,900
But the 3rd Platoon
has bigger troubles.

27
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,900
"Slim", Bearing's aide,
dreams of building

28
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,900
airplanes after
the war.

29
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,900
And finally, the artist.
He's not a soldier,

30
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,900
and only turned
up yesterday.

31
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,900
These are the
tragic heroes.

32
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,700
Watch them closely, since these
are the last hours of their lives.

33
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,900
Hi, Splinter,you're
right on time.

34
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,900
Were you hit?

35
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,900
A strong wind.

36
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,900
What's the situation?

37
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,900
As you see.
The Stukas came.

38
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,900
The Germans tried to
break through three times.

39
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,900
We're lucky that they
sleep at night.

40
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,900
You won't have a fun time
here, tomorrow.

41
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,900
Maybe a fun death.
We'll try to stay here for a while.

42
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,900
I'd like to stay
here, too.

43
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,900
What, until
Judgement Day?

44
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,900
We'll be hailed
by future generations.

45
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,900
They won't
take us alive.

46
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,900
Precisely.
The Polish way.

47
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,900
What's wrong? You've
always been so strong.

48
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,900
I've had enough, understand?

49
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,900
What am I supposed to tell
my men? They trust me.

50
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,900
You're losing it.
There's no time to think here.

51
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,900
Bartek almost abandoned
his position today.

52
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,900
As if he had
somewhere to go.

53
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,900
It's getting
more and more cramped.

54
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,900
They want to finish
Mokotow off,

55
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,900
and get started
on downtown.

56
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,900
Damn, I can't believe it's the
56th day of the Uprising.

57
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,900
It's hell...

58
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,700
Yes, that's always
an option...

59
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,900
We know each other.

60
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,900
You gave these to me
on the first day.

61
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,900
Do they fit?

62
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,700
Of course. To think that they
might pull them off my corpse.

63
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,900
But I see you've
joined the Uprising.

64
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,900
What does your mother
think of that?

65
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,900
She's dead.

66
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,900
Is your wound bad?

67
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,900
No, it's nothing.

68
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,900
It's too bad that you...

69
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,900
Excuse me, is there a
telephone anywhere nearby?

70
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,900
There will be.

71
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,900
Can I call
Rakowiecka Street?

72
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,900
Are you crazy?
The Germans are there.

73
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,900
I know, but...
I live there.

74
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,900
Please let me call,
all right?

75
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,900
Go see the commander.

76
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,300
That way?

77
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,900
Living in Warsaw must have been nice!

78
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,900
A bourgeois living room.
Absolutely horrible.

79
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,900
We have pistols and
hand grenades,

80
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,900
versus tanks
and airplanes.

81
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,900
When the hell
are we ever going to learn?

82
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,900
Orders are orders.
No sense in rationalizing.

83
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,300
Bearing!

84
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,300
Sir?

85
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,900
Post some sentries,
and send out a patrol.

86
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,900
Yes, sir.
I need six volunteers.

87
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,900
Yes, sir!
Yes sir!

88
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,900
I have a special
assignment for you.

89
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,900
Hold on for a minute.
You're a composer, right?

90
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,900
Yes.

91
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,900
Play something nice,
we have a piano.

92
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,900
But, l...

93
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,900
Come on...

94
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,700
Christ, a Bechstein!

95
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,900
Take that goddamned
thing off.

96
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,300
La Comparsita would
be much better,

97
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,700
or something like it.

98
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,900
I dreamt of you today,
Halinka.

99
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,700
We were
dancing a tango, and...

100
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,900
Well?
What's new?

101
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,900
Please, Lieutenant.
You promised me a gun.

102
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,700
I want to be armed.
Everyone has something...

103
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,900
That's it?
I was hoping it would be a Luger.

104
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,900
Oh, a Luger? It would
knock you off your feet.

105
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,900
This is perfect for you.
You can kill from six feet way.

106
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,700
Take it.

107
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,700
Stop that noise. Play
something... with some feeling.

108
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,900
I could get you a real gun,
instead of that cap gun.

109
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,900
Cap gun? And why
do you keep your antique?

110
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,900
Is everything clear?

111
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,900
Yes, sir!

112
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,700
Don't take unnecessary risks.

113
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,900
Can I phone home,
in Rakowiecka?

114
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,900
My family
should be there.

115
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,700
Can l
use that telephone?

116
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,900
Just ask them to connect us
to number 40218

117
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,900
All right, hold on.
Let's give it a try.

118
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,900
This is
Splinter. Are you still alive?

119
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,900
You don't have any
window panes?

120
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,900
I've forgotten what
they look like.

121
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,900
You're lucky that
you have a roof.

122
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,900
Listen, can you try
number 40218?

123
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,900
No, on the German side.
Rakowiecka.

124
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,900
We want to check if
there's anyone there.

125
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,900
Okay, I'll wait.

126
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,900
They're saying that there's no
one there anymore.

127
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,900
Wanda?
Wanda?

128
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,700
Wanda?
It's me, Michael.

129
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,900
What's happening
over there?

130
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,700
I've been looking
for you...

131
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,900
With the resistance.
I've joined one of the units.

132
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,900
I don't know how,
but it's still going...

133
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,900
What about you?

134
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,300
Evacuating?

135
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,300
Wanda...
My God!

136
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,900
Zosia.
Zosia.

137
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,700
Zosienka, it's me,
Daddy.

138
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,700
Zosia.
Zosia.

139
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,300
Wanda...
Hallo! Wanda!

140
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,900
Jesus.
They got cut off.

141
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,300
All sentries are
in place, sir.

142
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,700
Thank you.

143
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,900
Slim!

144
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,900
What am l
supposed to do now?

145
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,900
Go and get
some rest.

146
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,900
Everybody get ready
for supper!

147
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,700
Halinka, let's find
a place to sleep.

148
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,900
Lieutenant. Lieutenant, sir!

149
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,900
I don't have any records
of Bearing's platoon.

150
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,900
Don't bother me
with your records.

151
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,900
It's going to
start soon.

152
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,900
We must keep records, sir.
They're going to depend on them.

153
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,900
They'll depend on them.
That's for sure.

154
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,700
But stop
bothering me now!

155
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,900
Slim! Can you
see anything?

156
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,700
Nothing. The potato-diggers
have just returned.

157
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,500
Only the devil knows
if the potatoes

158
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,300
will do them
any good.

159
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,900
If they
send any more Stukas,

160
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,900
even the ruins will be destroyed.

161
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,900
Are you ready,
Bearing?

162
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,900
They 'll begin by
eight for sure.

163
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,900
I'm going to shave first.
I have ten ammo clips.

164
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,900
How old are
you, Bearing?

165
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,900
23.

166
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,900
At that age, life
doesn't seem so precious.

167
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,900
You know,
these are the final days.

168
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,300
I know, but we'll make
them bleed first.

169
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,700
Is Daisy
back yet?

170
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,900
What's wrong?

171
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,900
Nothing.

172
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,900
Do you know how
to use that? Careful!

173
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,900
Are you crazy?
It's easy.

174
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,900
Just be careful.

175
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,700
I'm going. The Germans are
finishing their breakfast.

176
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,700
What are you playing?

177
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,300
It's out of tune.
Too many aspiring musicians here.

178
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,900
I'm going.

179
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,900
Just don't go crazy. It'd be a
pity to lose an artist.

180
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,700
What do you know?

181
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,900
Oh, sorry.

182
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,900
That's all right.
Come in.

183
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,900
What's this about?

184
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,900
You should get up.

185
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,900
Now's not the time
for lovemaking.

186
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,900
You're speaking
to an officer.

187
00:18:52,900 --> 00:19:00,300
Now is precisely the time
for it. We're in love.

188
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,700
And how's Daisy?

189
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,700
Jacek, I'm here.

190
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,900
I don't stink, do l?

191
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,900
Because I left my shoes
in the hallway.

192
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,900
You should keep out
of those sewers.

193
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,900
You were supposed to
be back by yesterday.

194
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,900
Were you worried
about me?

195
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,900
I stopped worrying
long ago,

196
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,900
but Splinter was asking
about you.

197
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,900
Are you jealous?

198
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,900
Me? Forget it!

199
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,900
You, on the other
hand, spare no one.

200
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,900
I only smiled at Splinter,
and nothing else.

201
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,700
It looked as if you had
a soft spot for him.

202
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,900
That's just
the way I am.

203
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,900
That's not
a good thing.

204
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,900
You should've stayed
downtown,

205
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,900
with those
friends of yours.

206
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,900
They're going
to finish us.

207
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,700
I know.

208
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,900
Look at what
I brought you.

209
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,900
Real English tea,
and cigarettes.

210
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,900
You know I don't smoke?

211
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,900
Where did you
get them, anyway?

212
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,700
From my aunt.

213
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,700
Your aunt...

214
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,900
Jacek, I came back just
for you.

215
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,700
Me? That's interesting. Why?

216
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,900
Well, why?

217
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,700
Why? Because I'm your messenger.

218
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,300
Did you know that the main
attack will be here?

219
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,900
Stop shaving,
will you.

220
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,700
Wash up, because you stink.

221
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,900
Sun tanning
in the nude?

222
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,900
I spent all of July
in Zalesie.

223
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,900
I came back to Warsaw
on August 1st.

224
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,900
Only God
knows why...

225
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,900
Did you stay with your
aunt in Zalesie, too?

226
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,700
It's beginning.

227
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,900
Get out of here,
dammit!

228
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,700
Are you crazy?

229
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,900
Keep firing!

230
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,700
Left machine gun,
fire lower!

231
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,300
Look out!

232
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,700
Hello?

233
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,900
Hello, Bartek!
Great, both phones are dead!

234
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,900
They're going to come
from behind. Zephyr?

235
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,900
Yes, sir!

236
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,900
Go to H.Q.
Explain that we're holding

237
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,900
the red house,
and that the Germans

238
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,900
are near
Bartek's section.

239
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,900
We need a counter attack,

240
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,900
or else they'll cut
us off. Go!

241
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,900
Did you
get all that?

242
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,900
Sure.

243
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,700
Then go!

244
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,900
Junk!
Useless pipe!

245
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,900
They'll get to us
in ten minutes.

246
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,300
Withdraw.

247
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,900
We can't stop them with our bare hands!

248
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,700
God damn!

249
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,700
That's the last
shell, Slim...

250
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,900
Slim actually
hit them!

251
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,700
A Goliath...

252
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,700
Stop that...
I'm all right.

253
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,900
Keep still.

254
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,300
You're not hurt?

255
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,900
I'm glad
you're okay.

256
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,300
What's happening?

257
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,700
What about
the platoon?

258
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,700
What are
the Krauts waiting for?

259
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,300
Is Zephyr back?

260
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,300
No.

261
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,700
They've surrounded us.

262
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,900
How's Bearing?

263
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,900
He'll live.

264
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,900
They've wasted my men.

265
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,500
Don't get
too sentimental.

266
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,900
The silence is making
my ears ring.

267
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,900
It's only a short pause.

268
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,900
They're scheming
on how to get us.

269
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,700
The front didn't work,
so they'll try the back.

270
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,100
Now is an easy
time to withdraw, sir.

271
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,900
Lieutenant, you never
smoked before. Nerves?

272
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,300
Fear. It's eating
through all of us.

273
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,700
Not me. I've been smoking
since I was a kid.

274
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,300
When did you join
the resistance?

275
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,900
In July of 1941.

276
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,700
Any decorations?

277
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,300
The Cross of Valor
for an attack on Blank...

278
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,900
...for
an attack on Blank Palace.

279
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,900
Wounded in the chest,
in the right side,

280
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:30,700
on September 26th, 1944.
Any next of kin in case of death?

281
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,700
Thank you.

282
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,700
They've found a way.

283
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,900
I don't understand...

284
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,900
I've changed my mind.

285
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,900
I won't build planes
after the war is over.

286
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,700
Splinter. Splinter!

287
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,700
Game is looking for you.
Something's happened.

288
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,100
Sir! I report that the
company is in the Red House.

289
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,900
Hello, Splinter.

290
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,900
Leave us, Zephyr.

291
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,900
Losses?

292
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,700
12 dead.
10 critically wounded.

293
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,900
You'll be leaving
here at dusk.

294
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,900
We're going downtown.

295
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,900
What? How?
Which way?

296
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,700
Through the sewers.

297
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,900
I'm not going.

298
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,900
Are you crazy?

299
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,900
The are only a few
streets left.

300
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,900
Anyway, they're going to finish
us off by tomorrow.

301
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,900
I'm not going.
All that blood that was shed,

302
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,900
just so that we can
run away like rats?

303
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,700
The sewers?
How can I face my men?

304
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,900
It's an order, Splinter.

305
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,900
Screw your orders!

306
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,900
You're a damned civilian,
after all.

307
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,700
Don't you want to
rescue your men?

308
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,700
They trusted me.

309
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,900
We all trusted someone.

310
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,900
Here... this is your
pass to the sewers.

311
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,700
Take care, Splinter.

312
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,100
Gentlemen, why is it so
quiet in here? For God's sake!

313
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,900
So play a record
on the gramophone.

314
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,700
Stop that.

315
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,100
Stop that.

316
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,900
Maybe I should play
an entire symphony.

317
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,700
Here, you can try.

318
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,700
On this thing?

319
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,700
Smart ass...

320
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,900
Listen up, kids.
Good news.

321
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,700
What is it?
Reinforcements?

322
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,700
We're going downtown,
through the sewers.

323
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,900
What do you mean?
We're leaving here?

324
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,900
We can't hold Mokotow.
There are only

325
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:10,900
a few streets left.
They'll crush us.

326
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,900
Hear that, guys?

327
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,700
We've been fighting in
this coffin for nothing!

328
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,700
It's an order
from headquarters.

329
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,900
Nothing.
A void.

330
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,300
All I'm doing is making
up hollow sounds.

331
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,700
Don't drink
anymore, please.

332
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,700
I'm impotent, understand?
A pitiful hireling.

333
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,300
That's the real tragedy.

334
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,900
Please, don't drink.

335
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,900
I'm glad this misery
is ending.

336
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,700
Give it to me,
I want some, too.

337
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,900
He loves you, the handsome
trooper, doesn't he?

338
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,700
Is he you first?

339
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,900
I feel like we won't
live through this night.

340
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,700
It's easier to die
when you're in love.

341
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,700
That's nonsens!
Melodrama!

342
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,700
Don't get carried away.

343
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,900
Make room for the
company commander!

344
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,900
Drink Splinter.

345
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,900
You've gone mad.
Halinka, haven't you?

346
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,900
I'm not drinking.
I'm listening to music.

347
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,900
Music? So now you all
feel like hearing music?

348
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,900
And you're the one
who's playing?

349
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,900
That's because this will
be the last time!

350
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,900
Drink, Splinter. It'll be easier to
walk through the sewers.

351
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,900
So this is your
sense of discipline?

352
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,900
At your post until the end!
Only dead drunk!

353
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,900
It's a long way
to downtown.

354
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,900
There's plenty of time
to sober up.

355
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,900
What'll we
do downtown?

356
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,700
We'll keep fighting.

357
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,900
Keep fighting? They'll
crush us all like bed bugs.

358
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,900
There's not going to be
anything left of this city.

359
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,700
Shut up! Can't you even
die like a man?

360
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,300
On the contrary. Now l
finally know how to die!

361
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,900
Company roll call.

362
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,100
Yes, sir. But now it's a platoon
and not a company.

363
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,900
Don't anyone even dare
fart once we've started.

364
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,900
Absolute silence, like
in a family tomb.

365
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,900
Otherwise, the Germans
will cut us down.

366
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:35,900
If anyone is frightened, come
to me, and I'll hold his hand.

367
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,900
Come on,
cheere up!

368
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,700
Attention!

369
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,900
All present and accounted
for, sir, and ready to depart!

370
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,900
Two officers, five N.C.O.'s,
and twenty others.

371
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,900
You're drunk! This is
not the time for drills.

372
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,700
Thank you.
At ease! Forward march!

373
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,900
Can you make it,
Bearing?

374
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,900
I'll go.
Here, give that to me.

375
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,700
Let me try, I'm not
risking much.

376
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,700
He needs
two strong men.

377
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,900
I'll take care of him,
you don't need to worry.

378
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,900
It's better if you
come with me.

379
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,900
You can show us
the way.

380
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,900
That way is
pretty easy.

381
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,100
Please, let me go
with Bearing.

382
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,100
Wise, give us some
cover fire!

383
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,100
Tiger tanks.

384
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,900
This is the
last barricade.

385
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,900
Get in to sewers,
friend.

386
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,900
Lieutenant, may I respectfully
report that it's our turn...

387
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,900
Report respectfully
into the hole.

388
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,700
Why you little...

389
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,900
Sir, have you seen my
daughter? She's blonde...

390
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,900
Let's go!

391
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,900
Gentlemen, wait!
Please wait!

392
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,900
My daughter, blonde,
tall in a brown coat.

393
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,700
Please wait!
Gentlemen!

394
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,900
What's happened?

395
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:39,900
Crap!

396
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,900
Oh, God, the acoustics
are amazing!

397
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,900
"l see a land of heavy
dreams and shadows."

398
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,300
Stop the chit-chat and
get a move on, Maestro!

399
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,900
Quiet! The orders were, no talking!

400
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,700
I'm too tall for...
Goddamn it.

401
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,300
You're better
off, Halinka.

402
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,700
Gas! Gas!

403
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,900
Wise, let's turn back.
There's gas ahead.

404
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,900
The Germans must be
up there already.

405
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,700
We have to catch up to the company.

406
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:29,900
Stop!

407
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,900
The Germans have released gas!
Is this the way back?

408
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,700
I think so.

409
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,700
Anyway, who knows?
All the sewers look alike!

410
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,900
I'm from Old Town.

411
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,900
I've had enough
of these sewers,

412
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,300
and this stupid game
of hide and seek!

413
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,300
Go back, there's gas!

414
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,900
People, where
are you going?

415
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,700
Guys!

416
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:14,900
My head's spinning.
It must be the gas.

417
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:19,900
Jacek, it's your fever.
There's no gas here.

418
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,900
We're never going to
catch up.

419
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,900
Maybe we should
call Michael?

420
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,900
There's no need to,
I know this sewer.

421
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:34,300
It's not difficult. We'll make
it slowly by ourselves.

422
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,900
Daisy, I'm going to
rest for a minute.

423
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,900
Keep going, damn you!
Jacek, keep going.

424
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,700
We'll rest at home.

425
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,700
At home? Does anyone
still have a home?

426
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:04,900
You're really strong, Daisy,
as if you were a laborer

427
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,700
I've never been
a laborer.

428
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,100
You know, I don't know
anything about you.

429
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,700
We fought in the
resistance together.

430
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:24,900
I know that,
Daisy, but...

431
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,300
You want me to tell you
my life story now?

432
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,700
Is it a long story?

433
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,700
Longer than this sewer.

434
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,700
Keep going.

435
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,700
Jacek!

436
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,700
What's that?

437
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,900
Look...

438
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,900
Is it a lamp
at the crossing? Or...

439
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:20,900
Maybe the Germans?

440
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,900
They wouldn't dare
come down here.

441
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,900
Are you sure?

442
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,700
Positive.

443
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:58,900
Jacek, it's just a normal candle.
This is the first barricade.

444
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,700
You can rest here.

445
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,700
Well help me lift a wounded man!

446
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,700
What are you staring at?

447
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,700
Quiet! You dumb
son of a bitch!

448
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,700
It's allready seven.

449
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,700
It's already day up there.

450
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,900
Call Lieutenant Wise.

451
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:35,900
Lieutenant Wise, report
to Lieutenant Splinter.

452
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:42,900
Lieutenant Wise, report
to Lieutenant Splinter.

453
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:47,700
Gas! Gas! Gas!

454
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,900
It's going to be
extremely difficult

455
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,900
maintaining discipline
here,Lieutenant.

456
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,900
But we have to try and
keep control. What's next?

457
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,700
Let's wait for Wise.
We can't leave them behind.

458
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,900
Damned matches!

459
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,900
It's not the
matches, sir.

460
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,900
There are so many
feet stirring this crap.

461
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:26,900
Fumes are being released.

462
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,900
That's what's killing us,
and not the grenades.

463
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:34,900
I used to dabble in chemistry.
Don't you feel weak, Lieutenant?

464
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,900
No.

465
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,900
But, there's no
oxygen in the air.

466
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,900
Let's get out
of here, Lieutenant.

467
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:46,900
Well, Lieutenant? Do we let
the men die like this?

468
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,900
Is that my fault?
Why isn't Wise here, yet?

469
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:54,900
Call him!
Don't sit down!

470
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,700
It's worst near the water!
You won't be able to get up.

471
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:19,700
Let's go, Lieutenant.
We can't stay here.

472
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,700
I'm going to go, then,
to call them.

473
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:23,900
Lieutenant Wise says that
we should go ahead.

474
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,700
They stopped
so that Bearing could rest.

475
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:33,700
Daisy knows the way.
They'll catch up to us.

476
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,700
Let's go, Lieutenant.

477
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,700
Let's go, guys.

478
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:14,900
Slow down, Wise.

479
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:15,900
Faster, faster!

480
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,700
Splinter is probably
out on Aleje Street by now.

481
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,900
Give me the flask.

482
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,900
You're going to get weaker.

483
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,700
Give it to me,
come on!

484
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:44,900
You want some?

485
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,700
Sure. It's cold.
I've lost all my strength.

486
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:51,700
Enough already.

487
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:57,900
It's the Waters of Lethe.
River of Oblivion.

488
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,700
An ordinary homemade brew,
but it makes you feel better.

489
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,700
Did you hear those sounds?

490
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,900
Come on, Artist,
hurry up!

491
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,900
Christ! What is that?
Wise!

492
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,300
Jesus! Jesus!

493
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,700
Are you okay, Halinka?

494
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:39,900
Witold! Where are you?
Where's my child?

495
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,900
Shut up! Shut up,
damned woman!

496
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,700
You've sold us out!
Murderers!

497
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:14,900
"There, in the depths of the pit,
as we stand,

498
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,900
I see the people in a river of excretion

499
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:25,900
that seems to be the overflow
of the world's toilets."

500
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,900
What are you talking
about, Michael?

501
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,700
Not l, but Dante.

502
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:46,900
Get down here at once!
You'll draw the Germans' attention!

503
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,700
Faster!

504
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,900
Wise. Let's save ourselves!
I'm scared...

505
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,900
Stop whining!

506
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,700
Don't you think I want to
get out of here? Let's go back.

507
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:49,700
You look bad, Jacek.
You can shave when we're out.

508
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,900
I don't care.

509
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,700
You must be very ill.

510
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,700
What's that?

511
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:14,900
Raining?
That's rain... Quiet.

512
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:18,900
Don't cry, child.
Listen to that.

513
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:25,900
Don't you hear...
Everything 's singing.

514
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,900
Yeah, and maybe you're
seeing angels, also?

515
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,100
Get up! Keep going!
Don't stop!

516
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,700
Hear that?
Listen!

517
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,900
Nonsense!
It's just the water!

518
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:42,900
I can hear it!
Finally, I can hear it!

519
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:46,700
Do you?
I can hear it!

520
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,900
Shut up!
Damn you!

521
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:12,300
What's with you?
Have you lost it?

522
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:30,900
Ridiculous little man.
How could you understand?

523
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,700
Come back!
Don't be an idiot!

524
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,700
Stop, or I'll shoot!

525
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:57,700
I order you to come
back at once!

526
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:01,900
Wise...

527
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,700
Why am I so weak?

528
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,900
We're not going to
reach downtown, anyway.

529
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,900
There's no way.
This damned sewer

530
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:17,700
has to end somewhere!
Let's go.

531
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,700
What is that?

532
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:35,900
Probably a wounded man.

533
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,300
Could that really
be a human voice?

534
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:42,900
Let's keep going.

535
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:47,900
Sir, we can't make anything
out of those noises.

536
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:49,700
I'll go see what it is.
Wait here.

537
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,300
I found your noise-maker.

538
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:55,900
A man. Let's get out
of here, sir.

539
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,900
I know him. He's a
Colonel from Headquarters.

540
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,700
Which one of you
will carry him?

541
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,700
What's the matter?

542
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,300
Forward march!

543
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,900
Where... where is
that sign?

544
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,900
There should be a sign
for Wilcza Street

545
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:11,900
somewhere to the left.

546
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:15,900
We should have brought Daisy
along. She knows the way.

547
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:20,900
Daisy is helping Bearing,
and we know how to read.

548
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,900
I can't take
this, Lieutenant.

549
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:25,700
Let get out of here,
or we might be here forever.

550
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:30,300
There are no signs.

551
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:34,900
Call the men, Bullet.

552
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,700
Yes, sir!

553
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:55,900
Get up!
The Lieutenant is waiting!

554
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,900
Go on ahead.

555
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,900
Wait a few minutes.
I'm feeling weak.

556
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,700
We can rest for a bit.

557
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,700
There!

558
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:44,700
There should be
a sign here... Wilcza.

559
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:55,700
No, there's no sign.

560
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:15,900
Well?

561
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:18,900
They're close behind us.

562
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:21,700
Hold on to me, Splinter.

563
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:31,700
I've had enough of this.

564
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:45,900
All you have to do
is keep moving your legs.

565
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:48,900
Daisy...
aren't you tired?

566
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:52,700
Wh should I be tired?
I'm not wounded.

567
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,900
It's calm and misty.

568
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:03,900
We're taking a walk through
a dark and fragrant forest.

569
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:06,700
We're stumbling
through stinking shit.

570
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:14,700
You're always
straight to the point, Daisy.

571
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:23,900
I don't think you could
ever fall in love. Could you?

572
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:30,900
Keep moving those
legs of yours,

573
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:33,900
or we won't get
there for three days.

574
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:37,700
You have a fever,
and we'll die of hunger, here.

575
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:46,900
What's wrong?

576
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,700
Nothing.

577
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:56,700
What's that?

578
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:12,900
He was old. He probably
died during the gas panic.

579
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,900
Stupid people, never been
in the sewers before.

580
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:40,700
I don't see anything.

581
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:48,700
There it is, guys!
The sign!

582
01:08:55,900 --> 01:09:02,900
I... Iove...
Jacek.

583
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:04,700
Oh, God.

584
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:41,900
My head's spinning.
I think there's gas in the air.

585
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:45,900
Look at the fog.

586
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:49,700
You're a child, Jacek.
The fever's making you see things.

587
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:59,700
Wait, this is our sewer.
See it? Wilcza.

588
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:11,700
I wouldn't have
noticed it.

589
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:14,900
I can barely see now.

590
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:18,700
Let's go up there!
Give me your hand.

591
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,700
Your hand...

592
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:09,900
Hold on to me!

593
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:12,700
Jacek!

594
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:22,900
I can't go up that pipe!
I can't reach it.

595
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,700
Daisy, go by yourself.

596
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:30,700
You idiot!

597
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:35,900
You can't pull me up there, Daisy.

598
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,700
You should go
and get help.

599
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:41,700
I'll just rest
here and wait.

600
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:50,700
Look there's a sign over there.
Large letters...

601
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:56,900
I love...

602
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:58,900
We have to save
the batteries.

603
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:01,700
There's a sign there.
What does it say?

604
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:08,700
I love... Janek.

605
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:13,900
Who could have written
such nonsense?

606
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:18,900
It's not nonsense.
An empty sewer.

607
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:22,900
The Germans high above.
It's fear, you know?

608
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:26,900
Someone wrote that.
It made them feel better.

609
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,900
I used to pass
though here, too.

610
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:30,700
And what did you write?

611
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:35,900
Kiss my ass...

612
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:36,900
What?

613
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,700
...and other things like that.

614
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:45,900
And who's this Janek?

615
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:47,900
A guy that some girl loved.

616
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:50,900
Loved him a lot?

617
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:58,900
Yeah, she loved him a lot,
Jacek. Come on, let's go.

618
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:04,900
No, we won't get there, Daisy.
I'll just wait and rest here.

619
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:07,900
You'll come back with help,
won't you?

620
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:09,900
Get up!

621
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:10,700
No.

622
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:23,700
I must have imagined it...

623
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:32,700
My head is spinning so much.
I even hear music.

624
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:41,700
Must be the fever...
Wait, I can really hear it.

625
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:10,700
Who was that?

626
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,900
Is he crazy, or am l?

627
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:15,900
He is!

628
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:16,900
He's been crazy
for some time now,

629
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:17,700
don't you remember?

630
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:26,700
How strange!
I don't remember.

631
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:36,700
Michael.
Michael!

632
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:42,700
Michael!
Come back!

633
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:59,300
Quiet. He can't
hear anything.

634
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:06,700
Jacek, stop this whining,
and let's go!

635
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:15,900
I won't make it up there,
but I want to live.

636
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:20,700
Alright, Jacek,
don't worry, you'll live.

637
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,100
We'll go straight
that way.

638
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:28,700
The sewer should run
into the Vistula pretty soon.

639
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:44,900
It's dry here. There's got
to be an exit nearby.

640
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:46,900
Turn on the flashlight.

641
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:48,900
The battery's
almost dead.

642
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,700
We'll get there anyway.

643
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:02,900
No.
It's not possible!

644
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:05,900
I don't have
any strength left.

645
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:08,900
There's no way we're ever
getting out of here. It's over.

646
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:10,900
Over?
What do you mean?

647
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:14,900
It can't be over!
I have someone to live for!

648
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:17,900
I'm right here.
Who do you have to live for?

649
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:20,900
What are you talking about?
My wife and my child!

650
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:26,900
A wife and a child? How funny,
you've never mentioned them.

651
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:29,900
You've never worn
a wedding ring.

652
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:32,700
What?
I have it on me.

653
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:35,700
Look!

654
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:41,900
See? I have to live.

655
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:43,900
Let's go back,
up the sewer.

656
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,900
Hurry up, while I'm
still on my feet.

657
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:48,700
Hold on.

658
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:52,900
Turn off the light, Wise.

659
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:54,300
Get up, get up,
get up!

660
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,900
Daisy, I'm going to sit for a bit.

661
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:25,900
No.

662
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:31,900
I have...
I have to rest.

663
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:34,700
Jacek, we'll be at
the river soon.

664
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:43,900
I can't open my eyes.
It hurts.

665
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:48,900
Then don't.
It's the fever.

666
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:50,900
You're going to have
to go to a hospital.

667
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:53,300
Where's this hospital?

668
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:14,900
Don't you think we'll
get our lives back?

669
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:17,700
Never.

670
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:25,900
To live, Daisy.

671
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:28,900
I promised you that.

672
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,900
I was so rude to you...

673
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:32,900
We'll talk
about that later.

674
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:37,700
I've been bad.
I was bad.

675
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,700
I see some light
ahead, Jacek.

676
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:16,700
We're going to live.

677
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:59,300
Don't open your eyes.
It's really bright.

678
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:04,700
Is it much further?

679
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:31,900
I see water, Jacek.
And green grass.

680
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:34,700
Let's go there, Daisy.

681
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:48,900
You can rest now.
We go to the grass, soon.

682
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:52,300
No, don't open
your eyes because.

683
01:20:55,900 --> 01:21:11,700
...because the
sun's come out.

684
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:10,700
Hands up!

685
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:03,300
The wedding ring.

686
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:39,700
Come out! Come out!

687
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:57,900
Slim, throw that damned
gun away.

688
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:00,900
You're going to kill yourself.

689
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:02,900
That stunned me...

690
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:07,900
Throw it away.
Let's get some fresh air.

691
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:08,700
Get lost!

692
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:12,900
Light!

693
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:15,700
Air, sir!

694
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:20,900
We're going to the inlet.

695
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:25,900
Tell the men, Bullet.
The inlet.

696
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:29,700
We're turning left, guys.
Going to the inlet.

697
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:45,900
They're coming, Lieutenant.

698
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:48,700
They're coming.

699
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:06,700
No good.
The exit is blocked.

700
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:16,700
We're turning back.

701
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:22,900
We've got the strength.

702
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:24,900
I have to get my men out!

703
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:28,700
Sir, we have to get some air.
It's death back there.

704
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:39,700
They've hung grenades,
dirty bastards! Hold on.

705
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:57,700
Good.

706
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:06,700
One more, and we're
on our way.

707
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:33,700
Let's go. Let's go, Lieutenant.
Let's go.

708
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:51,700
Thank you,
Mother of God...

709
01:28:53,900 --> 01:29:08,900
Lieutenant,
where are we?

710
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:14,900
Why aren't they coming out?
Call them, Bullet.

711
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:20,700
We're safe. Fresh air,
at last! Let's go away, sir.

712
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:28,900
Bullet, call them.

713
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:30,900
They could have
walked too far.

714
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:33,900
They stayed behind
a long time ago.

715
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:36,700
I only pretended
they were behind us.

716
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:41,700
You bastard!

717
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:46,700
And my company?

718
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:49,700
My company's
still in there?

719
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:01,700
My company...

720
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:06,900
