1
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,245
Ah, there it is. My house.

2
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:01,549
And good old Cleveland Street. How could I ever forget it?

3
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,119
And there I am, with that dumb round face and...

4
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:07,019
that stupid stocking cap.

5
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:10,826
But no matter. Christmas was on its way.

6
00:01:11,128 --> 00:01:13,925
Lovely, glorious, beautiful Christmas...

7
00:01:14,265 --> 00:01:16,858
around which the entire kid year revolved.

8
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:44,490
Downtown Hohman was prepared for its yearly bacchanalia of...

9
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:47,221
peace on earth and good will to men.

10
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,876
Higbees' corner window was traditionally a high-water mark...

11
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,940
of the pre-Christmas season.

12
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,519
First nighters, packed earmuff to earmuff, jostled in wonderment...

13
00:02:49,058 --> 00:02:52,424
before a golden tinkling display...

14
00:02:52,762 --> 00:02:55,889
of mechanized, electronic joy.

15
00:03:40,475 --> 00:03:42,271
Wow, there it is.

16
00:03:43,345 --> 00:03:45,778
The holy grail of Christmas gifts.

17
00:03:45,848 --> 00:03:48,748
The Red Ryder 200-shot range model...

18
00:03:48,818 --> 00:03:49,977
air rifle.

19
00:03:50,887 --> 00:03:52,854
And there he is.

20
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:54,845
Red Ryder himself.

21
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:59,590
In his hand was the knurled stock of as coolly deadly-looking...

22
00:03:59,662 --> 00:04:03,654
a piece of weaponry as ever I had laid eyes on.

23
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,362
For weeks, I had been scheming to get my mitts on one of these...

24
00:04:12,474 --> 00:04:15,169
fearsome blue-steel beauties.

25
00:04:15,377 --> 00:04:19,608
My fevered brain seethed with the effort of trying to come up with...

26
00:04:19,681 --> 00:04:23,548
the infinitely subtle devices necessary to implant...

27
00:04:23,619 --> 00:04:26,815
the Red Ryder range model air rifle indelibly...

28
00:04:27,123 --> 00:04:29,488
into my parents' subconscious.

29
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,725
Ralphie!

30
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:32,227
Randy!

31
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:34,225
Down here in two minutes!

32
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:36,598
And I mean two minutes!

33
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,133
Come on, Ralphie. I got here first!

34
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:46,771
Cut it out.

35
00:05:12,534 --> 00:05:15,764
My mother, grabbing for her copy of Look magazine...

36
00:05:16,171 --> 00:05:20,470
would find herself cleverly trapped into reading a Red Ryder sales pitch.

37
00:05:23,312 --> 00:05:25,711
They traded Bullfrog. I don't believe it.

38
00:05:26,348 --> 00:05:27,507
What's that?

39
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:30,813
Well, for Christ's sake, the Sox traded Bullfrog...

40
00:05:30,886 --> 00:05:33,012
the only player they've got, for Shottenhoffer.

41
00:05:33,155 --> 00:05:35,714
"Four Eyes" Shottenhoffer, a utility infielder.

42
00:05:35,957 --> 00:05:38,948
Got a whole goddamned team of utility infielders.

43
00:05:39,027 --> 00:05:40,425
That's nice.

44
00:05:40,594 --> 00:05:42,493
Ralphie, on the double!

45
00:05:44,131 --> 00:05:46,360
Did you hear about this guy who swallowed a yo-yo?

46
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:47,728
Swallowed a yo-yo?

47
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:49,128
On a bet.

48
00:05:49,203 --> 00:05:51,727
Some clodhopper down in Griffith, Indiana.

49
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:55,804
They write the silliest things in the newspapers.

50
00:05:56,211 --> 00:05:58,838
What do you mean, silly? I mean that's real news.

51
00:05:58,947 --> 00:06:01,039
That's not like that politics slop.

52
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,813
What is the name of the Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?

53
00:06:07,522 --> 00:06:09,318
Victor. His name is Victor.

54
00:06:09,725 --> 00:06:11,216
How the hell did you know that?

55
00:06:11,217 --> 00:06:12,716
Everybody knows that.

56
00:06:14,395 --> 00:06:17,022
That's another one of your silly puzzles?

57
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:19,562
Yeah, it's another one of our silly puzzles.

58
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:22,999
Could be worth $50,000.

59
00:06:24,138 --> 00:06:25,900
What kind is it this time?

60
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,467
Name the great characters in American literature.

61
00:06:30,244 --> 00:06:33,701
Victor? The Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?

62
00:06:33,948 --> 00:06:37,212
Meanwhile, I struggled for exactly the right BB gun hint.

63
00:06:37,285 --> 00:06:38,717
It had to be firm, but subtle.

64
00:06:38,954 --> 00:06:41,979
Flick says he saw some grizzly bears near Pulaski's candy store.

65
00:06:47,895 --> 00:06:51,728
They looked at me as if I had lobsters crawling out of my ears.

66
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,565
I could tell that I was in imminent danger of over-playing my hand.

67
00:06:57,405 --> 00:06:59,304
Casually, I switched tactics.

68
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:01,065
Hey, Dad!

69
00:07:02,376 --> 00:07:05,640
I'll bet you'll never guess what I got you for Christmas.

70
00:07:07,181 --> 00:07:08,511
A new furnace.

71
00:07:10,351 --> 00:07:11,908
That's a good one, Dad.

72
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,550
My old man was one of the most feared furnace-fighters...

73
00:07:16,623 --> 00:07:18,385
in northern Indiana.

74
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:21,488
Hurry up, you're going to be late for school.

75
00:07:21,796 --> 00:07:24,161
Yeah. I'm running late already.

76
00:07:24,432 --> 00:07:25,955
Round one was over.

77
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:27,959
Parents, one.

78
00:07:28,102 --> 00:07:29,159
Kids, zip.

79
00:07:30,704 --> 00:07:33,570
I could feel the Christmas noose beginning to tighten.

80
00:07:33,908 --> 00:07:36,876
Maybe what happened next was inevitable.

81
00:07:36,944 --> 00:07:39,537
Ralphie, what would you like for Christmas?

82
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,874
Horrified, I heard myself blurt it out.

83
00:07:41,982 --> 00:07:46,008
I want an official Red Ryder carbine action 200-shot range model air rifle.

84
00:07:47,253 --> 00:07:49,186
No. Shoot your eye out.

85
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:53,020
Oh, no! It was the classic mother-BB gun block.

86
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,983
"You'll shoot your eye out."

87
00:07:55,228 --> 00:07:58,856
That deadly phrase uttered many times before by hundreds...

88
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:00,932
of mothers was not surmountable...

89
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:03,025
by any means known to kid-dom.

90
00:08:03,204 --> 00:08:07,003
But such was my mania, my desire for a Red Ryder carbine...

91
00:08:07,107 --> 00:08:10,371
that I immediately began to rebuild the dike.

92
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:14,572
I was just kidding. Even though Flick is getting one.

93
00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:16,681
I'd just like some Tinkertoys.

94
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,309
I couldn't believe my own ears. Tinkertoys?

95
00:08:19,452 --> 00:08:20,850
She'd never buy it.

96
00:08:21,287 --> 00:08:23,117
BB guns are dangerous.

97
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:24,780
I don't want anyone shooting his eye out.

98
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:34,496
Randy, will you eat? There are starving people in China.

99
00:08:43,944 --> 00:08:46,605
Mothers know nothing about creeping marauders...

100
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,770
burrowing through the snow toward the kitchen...

101
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:52,375
where only you, and you alone, stand between your tiny...

102
00:08:52,552 --> 00:08:55,281
huddled family and insensate evil.

103
00:09:03,162 --> 00:09:06,392
Save us, Ralphie! I just knew those bad guys...

104
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:08,899
would be coming for us in the end!

105
00:09:09,802 --> 00:09:13,032
Don't worry, Dad. As long as I got OI' Blue...

106
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,142
What've we got here, folks?

107
00:09:19,212 --> 00:09:22,146
Well, we figure it's Black Bart, Ralph.

108
00:09:22,514 --> 00:09:24,777
Well, just me and my trusty old...

109
00:09:24,884 --> 00:09:28,580
Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot range model air rifle.

110
00:09:29,088 --> 00:09:31,647
Lucky I've got a compass in the stock.

111
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:34,120
Well, I think I better have a look here.

112
00:09:48,074 --> 00:09:49,233
Oh, no!

113
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:52,006
It's OI' Blue!

114
00:09:52,312 --> 00:09:53,710
Oh, no!

115
00:09:54,513 --> 00:09:56,104
Cheese it, boys!

116
00:10:08,194 --> 00:10:11,890
There's another one! He's a dead-eye, ain't he?

117
00:10:19,105 --> 00:10:20,662
Okay, Ralphie!

118
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,833
You win this time, but we'll be back!

119
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:30,245
Adi¨®s, Bart.

120
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:34,611
But if you do come back, you'll be pushing up daisies!

121
00:10:39,558 --> 00:10:41,024
And don't you forget it!

122
00:10:41,093 --> 00:10:42,650
Well, son, you saved us!

123
00:10:42,728 --> 00:10:45,753
We were goners for sure! And you saved us!

124
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,604
Oldsmobile!

125
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:57,532
A pile of junk!

126
00:10:58,777 --> 00:11:00,971
That goddamned Olds is froze up again!

127
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:05,846
Some men are Baptists, others Catholics. My father was an Oldsmobile man.

128
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:10,211
That son of a bitch would freeze up in the middle of summer on the Equator!

129
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:11,950
Little pitchers...

130
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:13,250
Hold it!

131
00:11:26,638 --> 00:11:28,161
It's a clinker!

132
00:11:29,974 --> 00:11:32,100
That blasted, stupid furnace.

133
00:11:32,177 --> 00:11:33,507
Dadgummit!

134
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,239
Damn skates!

135
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:45,349
For Christ's sake, open up the damper, will you?

136
00:11:45,424 --> 00:11:48,119
Who the hell turned it all the way down again?

137
00:11:49,094 --> 00:11:50,117
Blasted!

138
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:04,503
In the heat of battle, my father wove a tapestry of obscenity...

139
00:12:04,742 --> 00:12:09,110
that as far as we know is still hanging in space over Lake Michigan.

140
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:22,924
Preparing to go to school was like getting ready...

141
00:12:22,994 --> 00:12:25,461
for extended deep-sea diving.

142
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:47,150
Come on, Mom, we're going to be late!

143
00:12:47,151 --> 00:12:48,850
Just wait, Ralph!

144
00:12:50,087 --> 00:12:52,646
My kid brother looked like a tick about to pop.

145
00:12:52,723 --> 00:12:53,518
What?

146
00:12:54,725 --> 00:12:55,554
What is it?

147
00:12:56,528 --> 00:12:58,188
What is it?

148
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:03,465
What is it?

149
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:05,465
I can't put my arms down!

150
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,606
Well, put your arms down when you get to school.

151
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,069
Hey, Flick! Wait up.

152
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:52,442
Wait up!

153
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,207
So what are you doing?

154
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:56,884
What does it look like I'm doing? Picking goobers?

155
00:13:57,121 --> 00:14:00,521
Hey, listen, smart ass. I asked my old man about sticking...

156
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,990
your tongue to metal light poles in winter...

157
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,460
and he says it will freeze right to the pole just like I told you.

158
00:14:06,697 --> 00:14:07,720
Baloney.

159
00:14:07,797 --> 00:14:09,764
What would your old man know about anything?

160
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,130
He knows because he once saw a guy stick his tongue...

161
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:15,796
to a railroad track on a bet and the fire department had to come...

162
00:14:15,872 --> 00:14:19,739
to get the guy's tongue off the track because he couldn't get it off.

163
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:21,571
Come on, guys, wait up!

164
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:23,134
Come on, guys!

165
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:25,843
Come on, guys, wait up!

166
00:14:31,088 --> 00:14:32,486
I can't get up!

167
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,553
I can't get up!

168
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:36,557
Help!

169
00:14:37,995 --> 00:14:40,258
I can't get out! Help me!

170
00:14:41,664 --> 00:14:43,324
Come on, Flick, wait up for me.

171
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:45,229
I can't get up!

172
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:49,500
Come on.

173
00:14:49,572 --> 00:14:51,903
Get up. Sit up. Come on.

174
00:14:53,743 --> 00:14:55,175
You're okay. Come on, let's go.

175
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:56,575
Come on, you're all right!

176
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:06,789
Miss Shields!

177
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:08,848
All right, everyone...

178
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:10,586
take your seats, please.

179
00:15:18,635 --> 00:15:20,431
Good morning, class.

180
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,835
Good morning, Miss Shields.

181
00:15:58,675 --> 00:16:01,074
Open your books to Page 32.

182
00:16:01,144 --> 00:16:04,010
And as you'll remember, Silas Marner...

183
00:16:14,489 --> 00:16:17,116
You're full of beans and so's your old man.

184
00:16:18,293 --> 00:16:19,522
Says who?

185
00:16:19,523 --> 00:16:20,522
Says me.

186
00:16:20,595 --> 00:16:22,494
Well, I double-dare you.

187
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,157
The exact exchange and nuance...

188
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,757
of phrase in this ritual is very important.

189
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:31,564
Are you kidding? Stick my tongue to that stupid pole?

190
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:32,640
That's dumb.

191
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:34,676
That's 'cause you know it will stick!

192
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:36,368
You're full of it.

193
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,039
Well, I double dog-dare you!

194
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,812
Now it was serious. A double dog-dare.

195
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:45,479
What else was left but a "triple-dare you"?

196
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,112
And finally, the coup de grace of all dares...

197
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,589
the sinister triple dog-dare!

198
00:16:51,193 --> 00:16:53,752
I triple dog-dare you!

199
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,230
Schwartz created a slight breach of etiquette...

200
00:16:57,332 --> 00:17:00,960
by skipping the triple-dare and going right for the throat.

201
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:02,366
All right, all right.

202
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:13,913
Go on, smart ass, and do it!

203
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:15,413
I'm going!

204
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:20,145
Flick's spine stiffened, his lips curled in a defiant sneer.

205
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:22,656
There was no going back now.

206
00:17:25,694 --> 00:17:27,285
This is nothing.

207
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,292
Stuck? Stuck!

208
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:35,460
Stuck! Stuck!

209
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:42,467
Jeez!

210
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:44,043
It really works!

211
00:17:44,112 --> 00:17:45,544
Look at him!

212
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:57,289
Ralphie, come back!

213
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:59,258
Come back! Don't leave me! Come back!

214
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:00,759
But the bell rang!

215
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:02,587
What are we going to do?

216
00:18:02,588 --> 00:18:04,387
I don't know! The bell rang!

217
00:18:14,576 --> 00:18:15,837
Where's Flick?

218
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:18,909
Has anyone seen Flick?

219
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:20,809
Flick? Flick who?

220
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:23,008
He was at recess, wasn't he?

221
00:18:24,652 --> 00:18:27,142
Ralphie, do you know where Flick is?

222
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:36,193
I said has anyone seen Flick?

223
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:40,193
Yes, Esther Jane?

224
00:18:46,274 --> 00:18:47,865
Oh, my God!

225
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:11,219
Holy cow, it's the fire department!

226
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,068
Wow, it's the cops!

227
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,586
Now, I know that some of you put Flick up to this.

228
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,859
But, he has refused to say who.

229
00:20:24,471 --> 00:20:27,098
But those who did it know their blame.

230
00:20:29,242 --> 00:20:32,301
And I'm sure the guilt you feel...

231
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:36,503
is far worse than any punishment you might receive.

232
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,946
Now, don't you feel terrible?

233
00:20:44,058 --> 00:20:46,890
Don't you feel remorse for what you have done?

234
00:20:49,296 --> 00:20:52,059
That's all I'm going to say about poor Flick.

235
00:20:55,102 --> 00:20:58,559
Adults love to say things like that. But kids know better.

236
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:02,472
We knew darn well it was always better not to get caught.

237
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:05,839
Now, boys and girls, I'm going to give you an assignment.

238
00:21:07,046 --> 00:21:08,740
I want you to write...

239
00:21:09,816 --> 00:21:11,009
a theme.

240
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:16,918
"What I want for Christmas."

241
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,780
The clouds lifted.

242
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:22,725
And I want it handed in tomorrow morning...

243
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:25,888
I saw a faint gleam of light at the other end of...

244
00:21:25,966 --> 00:21:27,830
the black cave of doom.

245
00:21:27,901 --> 00:21:31,927
I knew that when Miss Shields read my magnificent, eloquent theme...

246
00:21:32,005 --> 00:21:34,802
that she would sympathize with my plight...

247
00:21:34,874 --> 00:21:38,070
and everything would work out, somehow.

248
00:21:53,426 --> 00:21:55,893
Boy, did you see how it stuck?

249
00:21:56,462 --> 00:21:57,892
Did it hurt, Flick?

250
00:21:57,893 --> 00:21:59,692
No. I never felt a thing.

251
00:21:59,766 --> 00:22:01,192
It just caught me off-guard.

252
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:02,694
You sure were bawling.

253
00:22:02,695 --> 00:22:04,094
I never bawled!

254
00:22:04,236 --> 00:22:05,702
Baloney.

255
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:20,408
Scut Farkus!

256
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,614
Scut Farkus! What a rotten name. We were trapped.

257
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:27,591
There he stood, between us and the alley.

258
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,719
Scut Farkus, staring out at us with his yellow eyes.

259
00:22:31,064 --> 00:22:34,294
He had yellow eyes! So help me God, yellow eyes.

260
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:52,510
Grover Dill, Farkus' crummy little toady.

261
00:22:52,585 --> 00:22:54,074
Mean. Rotten.

262
00:22:54,153 --> 00:22:56,552
His lips curled over his green teeth.

263
00:22:57,156 --> 00:22:59,055
Randy lay there like a slug.

264
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,183
It was his only defense.

265
00:23:06,032 --> 00:23:07,158
Say "uncle."

266
00:23:07,158 --> 00:23:08,157
Uncle!

267
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:17,034
Louder!

268
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,878
In our world, you were either a bully, a toady...

269
00:23:21,947 --> 00:23:24,608
or one of the nameless rabble of victims.

270
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,875
All right.

271
00:23:26,084 --> 00:23:27,641
Who's next?

272
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:54,806
In the jungles of kid-dom, the mind switches gears rapidly.

273
00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:57,706
Weeks ago I had sent away for my Little Orphan Annie...

274
00:23:57,783 --> 00:23:59,807
secret society decoder pen.

275
00:24:00,152 --> 00:24:02,051
Oh, skunked again.

276
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,747
No matter. Today I had serious work to do.

277
00:24:05,424 --> 00:24:07,550
"What I want for Christmas."

278
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:10,753
"What I want is a Red Ryder BB gun with a compass in the stock...

279
00:24:10,828 --> 00:24:12,692
"and this thing which tells time."

280
00:24:12,863 --> 00:24:14,261
Wow, that's great.

281
00:24:14,331 --> 00:24:17,356
"I think that everybody should have a Red Ryder BB gun.

282
00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:19,333
"They're very good for Christmas.

283
00:24:19,938 --> 00:24:23,464
"I don't think that a football's a very good Christmas present."

284
00:24:24,276 --> 00:24:27,767
Oh, rarely had the words poured from my penny pencil...

285
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:29,642
with such feverish fluidity.

286
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,611
I've won! I've won!

287
00:24:47,832 --> 00:24:49,059
The Bumpus hounds.

288
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:53,028
Our hillbilly neighbors, the Bumpuses, had at least...

289
00:24:53,103 --> 00:24:54,967
785 smelly hound dogs.

290
00:24:55,573 --> 00:24:59,338
And they ignored every other human being on earth but my old man.

291
00:25:02,314 --> 00:25:03,610
I won!

292
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,009
I won!

293
00:25:07,652 --> 00:25:08,351
What?

294
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,278
A major prize!

295
00:25:09,354 --> 00:25:10,513
I won!

296
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:14,348
Hey, look at that. Look at that. A Western Union telegram.

297
00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:17,621
Tonight, he's coming tonight. Tonight. Hot damn, tonight!

298
00:25:17,695 --> 00:25:19,355
What does this mean here?

299
00:25:19,463 --> 00:25:21,225
It means it's coming tonight!

300
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:23,231
I called Ernie McClosky at the freight depot.

301
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,132
He said the telegram was late, the prize was already there...

302
00:25:26,203 --> 00:25:28,397
he was going to send it on tonight.

303
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:31,905
Come on. Have a chew, fellas, on me. It's my gift.

304
00:25:32,943 --> 00:25:37,276
You know, maybe it'll be one of those Spanish adobe houses down in Coral...

305
00:25:41,586 --> 00:25:44,019
Serves you right, you smelly buggers.

306
00:25:44,122 --> 00:25:46,282
Or it could be a bowling alley.

307
00:25:46,857 --> 00:25:49,051
A guy down in Terre Haute won a bowling alley.

308
00:25:49,193 --> 00:25:51,922
How are they going to deliver a bowling alley here tonight?

309
00:25:52,396 --> 00:25:55,762
They could send the deed, for cripesake. I mean...

310
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:59,399
I didn't expect they were going to send the whole damn bowling alley.

311
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:02,302
Yeah, well. How about eating? I'm starving to death.

312
00:26:02,573 --> 00:26:05,302
Getting rich is hard work, kid. Come on.

313
00:26:13,183 --> 00:26:15,377
Every family has a kid who won't eat.

314
00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:19,779
My kid brother had not eaten voluntarily in over three years.

315
00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:24,991
Oh, Randy, don't play with your food, eat it!

316
00:26:27,898 --> 00:26:30,229
Starving people would be happy to have that.

317
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:32,329
Can I have some more red cabbage?

318
00:26:39,276 --> 00:26:42,472
Stop playing with your food, or I'll give you something to cry about.

319
00:26:42,913 --> 00:26:46,075
You better stop fooling around with it and eat it or you'll be sorry.

320
00:26:51,454 --> 00:26:52,818
Can I please have some more?

321
00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:56,415
My mother had not had a hot meal for herself in 15 years.

322
00:26:58,595 --> 00:27:01,620
Meatloaf, double beetloaf.

323
00:27:02,231 --> 00:27:03,822
I hate meatloaf.

324
00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:07,592
All right. I'll get that kid to eat.

325
00:27:08,005 --> 00:27:09,767
Where's my screwdriver and plumber's helper?

326
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,205
I'll open up his mouth and I'll shove it in.

327
00:27:12,476 --> 00:27:14,534
My mother was more subtle.

328
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:17,342
How do the little piggies go?

329
00:27:18,082 --> 00:27:20,481
That's right. Oink, oink.

330
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:23,881
Now, show me how the piggies eat. This is your trough.

331
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:26,953
Show me how the piggies eat.

332
00:27:27,357 --> 00:27:30,189
Be a good boy. Show Mommy how the piggies eat.

333
00:27:58,955 --> 00:28:00,182
Oh, my.

334
00:28:00,657 --> 00:28:02,624
Mommy's little piggy.

335
00:28:23,012 --> 00:28:24,376
It's here.

336
00:28:32,088 --> 00:28:32,883
Are you Parker?

337
00:28:33,456 --> 00:28:34,548
All right, sign here.

338
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:35,548
Yeah. Well, what is it?

339
00:28:35,692 --> 00:28:36,885
I don't know.

340
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,617
What's in it?

341
00:28:38,695 --> 00:28:40,559
Here. Bring it in.

342
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:43,029
Okay, boys. Haul that on in here. Move your tails.

343
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:46,590
Bring it right on in. Right here. Bring it ahead. Straight ahead.

344
00:28:46,736 --> 00:28:47,793
That's right.

345
00:28:48,971 --> 00:28:50,062
Right.

346
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:52,936
Here, bring it right in, fellas. That's it. Here we go.

347
00:28:53,042 --> 00:28:55,134
A little more. Little more.

348
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,233
That's it.

349
00:28:59,014 --> 00:29:00,708
Watch the lady.

350
00:29:09,424 --> 00:29:11,118
Thanks a lot, guys.

351
00:29:11,193 --> 00:29:12,523
Merry Christmas.

352
00:29:12,595 --> 00:29:15,495
Get the crowbar and a hammer, Ralphie. Go on.

353
00:29:17,066 --> 00:29:19,090
"Fra-gi-ley."

354
00:29:19,268 --> 00:29:20,934
That must be Italian.

355
00:29:20,935 --> 00:29:22,634
I think that says "fragile."

356
00:29:22,872 --> 00:29:24,463
Oh, yeah.

357
00:29:25,808 --> 00:29:27,240
Here we go.

358
00:29:33,014 --> 00:29:35,243
They did a job on this, you know?

359
00:29:41,523 --> 00:29:43,820
No, here, Ralph, hold this.

360
00:29:50,232 --> 00:29:53,291
There could be anything in there!

361
00:29:53,368 --> 00:29:54,527
Jesus!

362
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,870
Maybe they forgot.

363
00:29:59,107 --> 00:30:01,939
It's in there. It's gotta be in there.

364
00:30:08,717 --> 00:30:09,982
Would you look at that?

365
00:30:09,983 --> 00:30:11,082
What?

366
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:13,517
Would you look at that?

367
00:30:16,124 --> 00:30:17,613
What is it?

368
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,724
It's a leg!

369
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:21,320
But what is it?

370
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,663
Well, it's a leg.

371
00:30:23,999 --> 00:30:25,397
You know, like in a statue.

372
00:30:25,967 --> 00:30:26,957
Statue?

373
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:27,957
Yeah, statue!

374
00:30:28,637 --> 00:30:30,297
Yeah, statue!

375
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:32,027
Ralphie!

376
00:30:32,473 --> 00:30:36,408
My mother was trying to insinuate herself between us and the statue.

377
00:30:36,644 --> 00:30:38,668
Holy smoke, would you...

378
00:30:38,747 --> 00:30:40,714
Do you know what this is?

379
00:30:40,782 --> 00:30:43,249
This is a lamp.

380
00:30:44,352 --> 00:30:46,148
It was indeed a lamp.

381
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:49,087
Isn't that great? What a great lamp!

382
00:30:50,158 --> 00:30:51,954
I don't know.

383
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:55,487
Here, hold it. Hold it. Here, go on.

384
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:58,262
The old man's eyes boggled...

385
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:00,990
overcome by art.

386
00:31:01,102 --> 00:31:03,035
I know just the place for it.

387
00:31:03,103 --> 00:31:06,094
Right in the middle of our front room window!

388
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:26,756
Jesus, God.

389
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:31,698
Honey?

390
00:31:31,699 --> 00:31:33,028
No. It's all right.

391
00:31:34,902 --> 00:31:36,368
Let's see...

392
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:41,106
This goes to the radio and this goes to the...

393
00:31:42,209 --> 00:31:44,699
Well, it's just one too many.

394
00:31:48,682 --> 00:31:49,670
Well, let's see.

395
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,980
The snap of a few sparks, a quick whiff of ozone...

396
00:31:53,053 --> 00:31:56,510
and the lamp blazed forth in unparalleled glory.

397
00:31:56,757 --> 00:31:59,247
Look at that! Will you look at that?

398
00:31:59,426 --> 00:32:01,620
Isn't that glorious?

399
00:32:03,098 --> 00:32:07,158
It's indescribably beautiful. It reminds me of the Fourth of July!

400
00:32:08,002 --> 00:32:08,968
Turn off all the lights.

401
00:32:09,036 --> 00:32:10,969
I wanna see what it looks like from the street.

402
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:12,435
I'll go get the dining room.

403
00:32:12,436 --> 00:32:13,835
Couldn't we talk this over?

404
00:32:34,461 --> 00:32:37,725
Move it a little bit to the right. A little that way.

405
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:42,024
Just a little... More to the right.

406
00:32:43,102 --> 00:32:45,092
Yeah. More. That's it. No, stop!

407
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:47,468
Right there. That's wonderful.

408
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:49,232
Parker, what is that?

409
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,209
Don't bother me now. Can't you see I'm busy?

410
00:32:51,378 --> 00:32:52,873
Yeah, but what is that?

411
00:32:52,874 --> 00:32:54,073
It's a major award.

412
00:32:55,149 --> 00:32:56,479
A major award?

413
00:32:57,518 --> 00:33:00,077
Shucks, I wouldn't have known that. It looks like a lamp.

414
00:33:00,154 --> 00:33:03,554
It is a lamp, you nincompoop. But it's a major award.

415
00:33:03,624 --> 00:33:04,885
I won it.

416
00:33:05,092 --> 00:33:06,955
Damn, hell, you say you won it?

417
00:33:06,956 --> 00:33:07,855
Yeah.

418
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:10,689
Mind power, Sweed, mind power.

419
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,527
The entire neighborhood was turned on.

420
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:16,499
You should see what it looks like from out here!

421
00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:19,637
It could be seen up and down Cleveland Street.

422
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,673
The symbol of the old man's victory.

423
00:33:21,808 --> 00:33:23,968
Yeah, he won that. It's a major award.

424
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:27,534
Isn't it about time for somebody's favorite radio program?

425
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,547
Holy smokes, it was 6:45.

426
00:33:31,685 --> 00:33:33,845
Only one thing that could've dragged me away...

427
00:33:33,921 --> 00:33:37,913
from the soft glow of electric sex gleaming in the window.

428
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,633
Kids, it's Little Orphan Annie time.

429
00:33:52,705 --> 00:33:55,366
Brought to you by rich, chocolaty Ovaltine.

430
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:57,305
I could still taste it.

431
00:33:59,045 --> 00:34:00,841
Hey, you turned the light off!

432
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:20,965
I knew I was handing Miss Shields a masterpiece.

433
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:24,734
Maybe Miss Shields, in her ecstasy, would excuse me from theme writing...

434
00:34:24,804 --> 00:34:27,363
for the rest of my natural life.

435
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,842
You call this a paragraph?

436
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:41,413
Margins! Margins! "F"!

437
00:34:42,355 --> 00:34:45,152
My life's work down the drain.

438
00:34:46,091 --> 00:34:47,955
A semicolon, you dolt!

439
00:34:48,026 --> 00:34:49,117
A period.

440
00:34:49,428 --> 00:34:50,189
"F"!

441
00:34:50,328 --> 00:34:54,730
Oh, I should weep if I have to read one more "F"!

442
00:34:56,369 --> 00:34:57,926
Ralphie Parker.

443
00:35:13,586 --> 00:35:16,213
The theme I've been waiting for all my life.

444
00:35:16,688 --> 00:35:18,245
Listen to this sentence.

445
00:35:18,657 --> 00:35:23,025
"A Red Ryder BB gun with a compass in the stock...

446
00:35:24,296 --> 00:35:26,991
"and this thing which tells time."

447
00:35:29,101 --> 00:35:30,294
Poetry.

448
00:35:30,368 --> 00:35:31,834
Sheer poetry.

449
00:35:32,204 --> 00:35:35,400
Ralph, an "A+."

450
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:37,432
My Ralph!

451
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,678
Oh, Ralphie, you've made me proud.

452
00:35:42,615 --> 00:35:44,013
"A+"!

453
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,943
Is there something you want, Ralph?

454
00:36:24,623 --> 00:36:27,250
I'm just turning in my theme.

455
00:36:29,394 --> 00:36:31,088
Well, you can take your seat now.

456
00:36:34,132 --> 00:36:35,325
Take your seat.

457
00:36:53,717 --> 00:36:55,445
Come on, you guys.

458
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:03,158
Get in the car. Get in the car.

459
00:37:04,029 --> 00:37:07,225
If we don't hurry we're going to miss all the good trees!

460
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:12,860
My mother was about to make another brilliant maneuver...

461
00:37:13,004 --> 00:37:15,938
in the legendary battle of the lamp.

462
00:37:16,074 --> 00:37:20,908
The epic struggle which followed lives in the folklore of Cleveland Street...

463
00:37:21,012 --> 00:37:22,308
to this very day.

464
00:37:22,413 --> 00:37:25,176
Don't want to waste electricity.

465
00:37:25,382 --> 00:37:27,110
"Don't want to waste electricity."

466
00:37:27,351 --> 00:37:29,910
Come on, Ralphie. Get in the car.

467
00:37:35,593 --> 00:37:37,617
You folks looking for a tree? We got 300 trees.

468
00:37:37,695 --> 00:37:40,959
This is the Christmas tree emporium of the entire Midwest.

469
00:37:41,031 --> 00:37:44,557
Now, you ain't gonna find no better tree than this here tree.

470
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:47,028
This here tree is built to last.

471
00:37:47,138 --> 00:37:48,934
Ain't no needles coming off this here tree.

472
00:37:52,143 --> 00:37:54,337
Okay. Now here's a tree.

473
00:37:54,411 --> 00:37:56,275
This here is a tree.

474
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,848
That's a little skimpy in the front.

475
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:00,748
Well, you just put it in the corner.

476
00:38:00,918 --> 00:38:02,546
Haven't you got a big tree?

477
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:04,546
Hell, this ain't no tree.

478
00:38:05,089 --> 00:38:07,488
Now here's a tree. This here is a tree.

479
00:38:09,126 --> 00:38:10,925
Wait'll the dogs see that one.

480
00:38:10,926 --> 00:38:12,754
Don't you think it's a little large?

481
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:16,128
Listen, Christmas only comes once a year. Why not?

482
00:38:16,533 --> 00:38:17,297
How much?

483
00:38:17,298 --> 00:38:18,397
I'll knock off $2...

484
00:38:18,502 --> 00:38:20,594
because I can see you're a man who knows his trees.

485
00:38:20,704 --> 00:38:24,070
This isn't one of those trees that all the needles falls off, is it?

486
00:38:24,175 --> 00:38:25,869
No, that's them balsams.

487
00:38:25,976 --> 00:38:28,671
The old man loved bargaining as much as an Arab trader...

488
00:38:28,746 --> 00:38:30,474
and he was twice as shrewd.

489
00:38:30,547 --> 00:38:32,946
You know, Dew Lock just bought one of those brand new...

490
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:35,244
green plastic trees.

491
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,880
Darn thing looks like it was made out of...

492
00:38:39,523 --> 00:38:41,422
green pipe cleaners.

493
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:44,151
This is a very nice tree.

494
00:38:44,328 --> 00:38:46,761
I'll throw in some rope and tie it to your car for you.

495
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,296
You got a deal.

496
00:38:48,499 --> 00:38:49,328
Deal.

497
00:39:09,219 --> 00:39:10,913
Damn it. Blow out!

498
00:39:19,363 --> 00:39:20,920
Not again.

499
00:39:22,132 --> 00:39:23,564
Four minutes!

500
00:39:23,634 --> 00:39:25,157
Time me.

501
00:39:26,303 --> 00:39:28,133
Actually, my old man loved it.

502
00:39:28,238 --> 00:39:31,536
He always saw himself in the pits at the Indianapolis Speedway...

503
00:39:31,641 --> 00:39:32,629
in the 500.

504
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,614
My old man's spare tires were actually only tires...

505
00:39:40,683 --> 00:39:41,876
in the academic sense.

506
00:39:42,085 --> 00:39:44,644
They were round. They had once been made of rubber.

507
00:39:49,093 --> 00:39:52,186
Ralphie, why don't you go help your father?

508
00:39:52,629 --> 00:39:53,428
Really? Can I?

509
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:54,255
Yes.

510
00:39:54,765 --> 00:39:55,932
Watch the traffic, there.

511
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:56,732
Okay.

512
00:39:57,568 --> 00:40:00,092
It was the first time that it had been suggested that...

513
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,535
I go help my father with anything.

514
00:40:06,743 --> 00:40:08,538
What are you doing here?

515
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:09,438
Mom says I should help.

516
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,639
Okay, sit down here. Squat down.

517
00:40:14,517 --> 00:40:15,813
Yeah, that's it.

518
00:40:16,018 --> 00:40:17,814
Here. Hold this.

519
00:40:21,491 --> 00:40:24,982
No, not that way. Come on, rat trap, hold it like this.

520
00:40:25,061 --> 00:40:25,492
How?

521
00:40:25,493 --> 00:40:25,992
Like this.

522
00:40:26,062 --> 00:40:27,961
I want to put the nuts in it. There we are.

523
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:31,021
There's four of them. And we got it!

524
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:34,867
There it is.

525
00:40:35,104 --> 00:40:38,300
That son of a gun. I'm gonna get that dirty...

526
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:39,537
There we go.

527
00:40:40,777 --> 00:40:43,108
For one brief moment I saw all the bolts silhouetted...

528
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:45,703
against the lights of the traffic. And then they were gone.

529
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,578
Oh, fudge!

530
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:55,188
Only I didn't say "fudge."

531
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:57,121
I said the word.

532
00:40:57,326 --> 00:41:00,556
The big one. The queen mother of dirty words.

533
00:41:00,897 --> 00:41:03,296
The "f, dash, dash, dash" word.

534
00:41:03,366 --> 00:41:05,265
What did you say?

535
00:41:08,203 --> 00:41:10,898
That's what I thought you said.

536
00:41:13,376 --> 00:41:15,172
Get in the car.

537
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,103
Go on.

538
00:41:19,182 --> 00:41:21,445
It was all over. I was dead.

539
00:41:21,684 --> 00:41:24,311
What would it be? The guillotine? Hanging?

540
00:41:24,387 --> 00:41:27,287
The chair? The rack? The Chinese water torture?

541
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:31,782
Mere child's play compared to what surely awaited me.

542
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,893
Everything go all right?

543
00:41:51,613 --> 00:41:53,307
Eight minutes.

544
00:41:55,617 --> 00:41:57,949
Do you know what your son just said?

545
00:41:57,951 --> 00:41:58,950
No. What?

546
00:41:59,689 --> 00:42:01,986
I'll tell you what he said. Randy!

547
00:42:05,661 --> 00:42:06,388
Ralphie!

548
00:42:08,497 --> 00:42:11,397
Over the years, I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap.

549
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,697
My personal preference is for Lux, but I found Palmolive had a nice...

550
00:42:15,871 --> 00:42:17,963
piquant, after-dinner flavor.

551
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:21,565
Heady, but with just a touch of mellow smoothness.

552
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,379
Lifebuoy, on the other hand...

553
00:42:29,384 --> 00:42:31,248
You ready to tell me?

554
00:42:35,957 --> 00:42:38,516
All right. Where did you hear that word?

555
00:42:38,694 --> 00:42:42,595
Now I had heard that word at least 10 times a day from my old man.

556
00:42:42,764 --> 00:42:45,061
My father worked in profanity the way...

557
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:47,599
other artists might work in oils or clay.

558
00:42:47,702 --> 00:42:50,397
It was his true medium. A master.

559
00:42:50,472 --> 00:42:52,871
But I chickened out. And I blurted out...

560
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:55,008
the first name that came to mind.

561
00:42:55,076 --> 00:42:56,337
Schwartz!

562
00:42:58,046 --> 00:42:59,637
I see.

563
00:43:11,025 --> 00:43:13,891
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz? Yes, I'm fine.

564
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:17,885
Mrs. Schwartz, do you know what Ralph just said?

565
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,666
No.

566
00:43:20,936 --> 00:43:22,459
He said...

567
00:43:24,439 --> 00:43:25,962
Not that!

568
00:43:26,174 --> 00:43:27,435
Yes, that.

569
00:43:27,576 --> 00:43:29,044
Do you know where he heard it?

570
00:43:29,045 --> 00:43:30,644
Probably from his father.

571
00:43:30,645 --> 00:43:33,135
No! He heard it from your son!

572
00:43:33,214 --> 00:43:34,202
What?

573
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:43,551
What'd I do, Mom?

574
00:43:44,325 --> 00:43:46,292
Why? I didn't do nothing!

575
00:43:51,332 --> 00:43:54,994
Another shot of mysterious, inexorable, official justice.

576
00:43:55,569 --> 00:44:00,335
Rinse out and go to bed. Am I glad you finished your homework!

577
00:44:00,507 --> 00:44:03,441
Get right into bed, and I don't want to see any lights on.

578
00:44:03,511 --> 00:44:06,479
You are being punished, so no comic book reading!

579
00:44:06,581 --> 00:44:08,571
I'll come in, and if any lights are on...

580
00:44:08,683 --> 00:44:11,583
Don't you give me that look! You're gonna get it!

581
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:36,103
Three blocks away, Schwartz was getting his.

582
00:44:37,745 --> 00:44:40,144
There has never been a kid who didn't believe...

583
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:44,214
vaguely but insistently, that he would be stricken blind...

584
00:44:44,385 --> 00:44:48,184
before he reached 21. And then they'd be sorry.

585
00:44:58,966 --> 00:45:00,762
Why, it's Ralph!

586
00:45:01,635 --> 00:45:04,865
Well, come on in, Ralph. Where've you been?

587
00:45:09,877 --> 00:45:11,207
Why, he's carrying a cane!

588
00:45:11,278 --> 00:45:12,767
What is it, Ralph? What happened?

589
00:45:12,846 --> 00:45:14,710
Why, he's blind!

590
00:45:14,782 --> 00:45:16,612
Blind? Oh, my God!

591
00:45:19,752 --> 00:45:21,412
Ralph, is it something we did?

592
00:45:21,521 --> 00:45:24,353
What brought you to this lonely state?

593
00:45:25,658 --> 00:45:28,592
Ralph, please tell us no matter how it hurts. What did we do?

594
00:45:29,463 --> 00:45:31,225
Look, I can't.

595
00:45:31,298 --> 00:45:33,197
Please, Ralph. I must know what we did.

596
00:45:33,434 --> 00:45:35,333
What brought you to this?

597
00:45:44,845 --> 00:45:47,005
Soap poisoning.

598
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,214
Oh, how could we do it?

599
00:45:56,889 --> 00:45:59,948
I'll manage to get along, somehow.

600
00:46:00,927 --> 00:46:02,360
I'll never forgive myself.

601
00:46:02,361 --> 00:46:03,360
Thanks, Mom.

602
00:46:03,529 --> 00:46:06,122
I told you not to use Lifebuoy.

603
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,996
I feel awful!

604
00:46:34,026 --> 00:46:34,889
Thank you, Heather.

605
00:46:34,961 --> 00:46:35,857
Merry Christmas.

606
00:46:35,858 --> 00:46:36,757
Merry Christmas.

607
00:46:37,563 --> 00:46:38,358
Thank you, Flick.

608
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:40,554
Merry Christmas, Miss Shields.

609
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:08,650
I just thought that you'd be getting tired of the same old stuff.

610
00:47:08,761 --> 00:47:12,025
Yes, truly, a little bribe never hurts.

611
00:47:12,565 --> 00:47:14,623
Well, thank you very much, Ralph.

612
00:47:20,072 --> 00:47:21,868
Merry Christmas.

613
00:47:24,609 --> 00:47:25,870
Happy New Year.

614
00:47:28,713 --> 00:47:30,771
You can take your seat now, Ralph.

615
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:57,432
The weeks of drinking gallons of Ovaltine, in order to get...

616
00:47:57,542 --> 00:48:00,977
the Ovaltine inner seal to send off for my Little Orphan Annie...

617
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:04,572
secret decoder pen, was about to pay off.

618
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:08,045
I got it. "Master Ralph Parker."

619
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:09,847
My decoder pen!

620
00:48:14,226 --> 00:48:15,692
All right!

621
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,832
"Be it known to all that Ralph Parker is hereby appointed...

622
00:48:23,903 --> 00:48:26,666
"a member of the Little Orphan Annie secret circle and...

623
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:29,639
"is entitled to all the honors and benefits occurring thereto."

624
00:48:30,175 --> 00:48:32,301
Signed, Little Orphan Annie.

625
00:48:32,544 --> 00:48:34,909
Countersigned, Pierre Andre!

626
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,576
In ink!

627
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:40,308
Honors and benefits. Already at the age of nine.

628
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:47,487
Come on. Let's get on with it.

629
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:50,527
I don't need all that jazz about smugglers and pirates.

630
00:48:51,563 --> 00:48:54,122
Listen tomorrow night for the concluding adventure of...

631
00:48:54,232 --> 00:48:57,223
The Black Pirate Ship. Now it's time...

632
00:48:57,369 --> 00:49:01,429
for Annie's secret message for you members of the secret circle.

633
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:04,299
Remember, kids, only members of...

634
00:49:04,376 --> 00:49:08,436
Annie's secret circle can decode Annie's secret message.

635
00:49:08,647 --> 00:49:11,740
Remember, Annie is depending on you.

636
00:49:12,684 --> 00:49:14,844
Set your pins to B-2.

637
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,346
Here is the message.

638
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:18,986
12. 11. 2...

639
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:21,524
I am in my first secret meeting.

640
00:49:21,593 --> 00:49:24,356
...25. 14. 11. 18.

641
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:26,191
16. 23...

642
00:49:26,264 --> 00:49:27,958
Pierre was in great voice tonight.

643
00:49:28,033 --> 00:49:31,798
I could tell that tonight's message was really important.

644
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:33,259
...3. 25.

645
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:37,533
That's a message from Annie herself. Remember, don't tell anyone.

646
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:44,313
Ninety seconds later I'm in the only room in the house...

647
00:49:44,382 --> 00:49:47,680
where a boy of nine can sit in privacy and decode.

648
00:49:50,188 --> 00:49:52,747
Ah! "B." I went to the next.

649
00:49:53,758 --> 00:49:56,385
"E." The first word is "be"!

650
00:49:56,861 --> 00:49:59,954
"S." It was coming easier now. "U."

651
00:50:01,766 --> 00:50:04,359
Come on, Ralphie! I gotta go.

652
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:06,763
I'll be right down, Ma.

653
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,268
Gee whiz.

654
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:12,866
"T. O."

655
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:16,310
"Be sure to." Be sure to what?

656
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:19,142
What was Little Orphan Annie trying to say? Be sure to what?

657
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,341
Ralphie! Randy has got to go! Will you please come out?

658
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:25,148
All right, Ma! I'll be right out!

659
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:26,989
I was getting closer now.

660
00:50:27,092 --> 00:50:30,060
The tension was terrible. What was it?

661
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:32,357
The fate of the planet may hang in the balance.

662
00:50:32,897 --> 00:50:34,955
Ralphie! Randy's gotta go!

663
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:38,526
I'll be right out, for crying out loud!

664
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:41,631
Almost there! My fingers flew.

665
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:43,399
My mind was a steel trap.

666
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:44,905
Every pore vibrated.

667
00:50:45,309 --> 00:50:46,969
It was almost clear.

668
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:48,167
Yes!

669
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:56,579
Ovaltine?

670
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:02,052
A crummy commercial?

671
00:51:04,695 --> 00:51:06,218
Son of a bitch!

672
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:10,955
I went out to face the world again.

673
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:12,533
Wiser.

674
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:26,948
Red cabbage?

675
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:29,985
No, that's for tomorrow night. You love red cabbage, Ralphie.

676
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,889
You filthy system!

677
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:35,617
I hate it!

678
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:38,420
Schmucker! Smelly watt-buster!

679
00:51:47,136 --> 00:51:51,504
What happened next was a family controversy for years.

680
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:09,550
What was that? What happened?

681
00:52:13,796 --> 00:52:15,228
What happened?

682
00:52:15,998 --> 00:52:17,487
What broke?

683
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:19,529
I don't know what happened.

684
00:52:19,602 --> 00:52:21,865
I was watering my plant and...

685
00:52:23,172 --> 00:52:24,934
I broke your lamp.

686
00:52:40,124 --> 00:52:41,784
Don't you touch that!

687
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:44,918
You were always jealous of this lamp.

688
00:52:45,661 --> 00:52:47,127
Jealous of a plastic leg?

689
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,389
Jealous!

690
00:52:48,564 --> 00:52:50,793
Jealous because I won.

691
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:54,191
That's ridiculous! Jealous?

692
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,462
Jealous of what?

693
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:58,002
That is...

694
00:52:58,074 --> 00:53:02,032
the ugliest lamp I have ever seen in my entire life!

695
00:53:02,411 --> 00:53:03,968
Now it was out.

696
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,676
Get the glue.

697
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:08,512
We're out of glue.

698
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:15,153
You used up all the glue on purpose!

699
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:19,392
The old man stood quivering with fury...

700
00:53:19,495 --> 00:53:21,928
stammering as he tried to come up with a real crusher.

701
00:53:22,331 --> 00:53:23,592
All he got out was:

702
00:53:23,666 --> 00:53:24,962
Not a finger!

703
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:07,937
With as much dignity as he could muster...

704
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:10,603
the old man gathered up the sad remains...

705
00:54:10,713 --> 00:54:13,237
of his shattered major award.

706
00:54:14,116 --> 00:54:16,913
Later that night, alone in the backyard...

707
00:54:17,319 --> 00:54:19,149
he buried it next to the garage.

708
00:54:19,754 --> 00:54:21,414
Now I could never be sure...

709
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:25,484
but I thought that I heard the sound of taps being played...

710
00:54:25,794 --> 00:54:27,055
gently.

711
00:54:27,462 --> 00:54:29,190
Know what I'm getting my old man for Christmas?

712
00:54:29,264 --> 00:54:30,060
What?

713
00:54:30,061 --> 00:54:31,060
A rose that squirts.

714
00:54:31,132 --> 00:54:33,190
People come to smell it, it squirts them.

715
00:54:33,368 --> 00:54:35,494
I'm getting my old man a Flit gun.

716
00:54:35,495 --> 00:54:36,894
A Flit gun?

717
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:41,402
Stop right there!

718
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:45,546
Ordinarily, if Dill so much as said "hi" to you, you felt great...

719
00:54:46,048 --> 00:54:49,574
warm inside. But mostly he just hit you in the mouth.

720
00:54:49,851 --> 00:54:52,512
I can't now, Grover. I've gotta go see Miss Shields.

721
00:54:52,854 --> 00:54:55,754
Hey, come here! Get over here!

722
00:54:56,191 --> 00:54:58,124
Come on, you! Hey, come here!

723
00:54:59,628 --> 00:55:00,559
You! Come here!

724
00:55:00,795 --> 00:55:01,522
Who, me?

725
00:55:01,763 --> 00:55:03,163
No, your Aunt Tilly.

726
00:55:03,164 --> 00:55:04,663
Yeah, you. Get over here!

727
00:55:04,866 --> 00:55:07,857
I left Flick to certain annihilation.

728
00:55:08,903 --> 00:55:11,393
But BB gun mania knows no loyalties.

729
00:55:11,873 --> 00:55:13,840
Uncle! Uncle!

730
00:55:18,813 --> 00:55:19,836
All right, class.

731
00:55:20,281 --> 00:55:22,874
I have your Christmas themes for you.

732
00:55:23,918 --> 00:55:25,282
I'm pleased.

733
00:55:25,887 --> 00:55:28,081
In general, you did very well.

734
00:55:31,259 --> 00:55:34,785
However, I was disappointed in the margins.

735
00:55:37,432 --> 00:55:39,023
This is it.

736
00:55:40,402 --> 00:55:42,596
"C+"? No, it can't be.

737
00:55:43,038 --> 00:55:44,436
C+?

738
00:55:44,606 --> 00:55:46,630
C+!

739
00:55:54,415 --> 00:55:55,642
Oh, no!

740
00:55:56,817 --> 00:55:58,477
"You'll shoot your eye out"?

741
00:56:00,821 --> 00:56:02,788
My mother must have gotten to Miss Shields.

742
00:56:02,956 --> 00:56:04,547
There could be no other explanation.

743
00:56:04,826 --> 00:56:08,955
You'll shoot your eye out. You'll shoot your eye out.

744
00:56:11,533 --> 00:56:15,263
Was there no end to this conspiracy of irrational prejudice...

745
00:56:15,337 --> 00:56:17,634
against Red Ryder and his peacemaker?

746
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:22,036
These multiplication questions were most missed in our last math test.

747
00:56:22,143 --> 00:56:23,700
Would you answer in unison, please?

748
00:56:24,011 --> 00:56:26,911
I was surrounded by happier kids who were all going to get...

749
00:56:27,014 --> 00:56:28,571
what they wanted for Christmas.

750
00:56:28,949 --> 00:56:30,176
...fifty-six.

751
00:57:00,848 --> 00:57:02,371
Hey, four-eyes!

752
00:57:02,449 --> 00:57:05,008
How'd you like your snowball sandwich?

753
00:57:05,686 --> 00:57:07,676
Maybe you'd like another one!

754
00:57:13,227 --> 00:57:14,215
Listen, jerk.

755
00:57:14,461 --> 00:57:17,759
When I tell you to come, you better come!

756
00:57:18,966 --> 00:57:21,433
What? Are you going to cry now?

757
00:57:21,635 --> 00:57:25,400
Come on, cry baby, cry for me. Come on.

758
00:57:25,773 --> 00:57:27,262
Cry!

759
00:57:27,407 --> 00:57:29,203
Deep in the recesses of my brain...

760
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:32,709
a tiny red-hot little flame began to grow.

761
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,585
Something had happened.

762
00:57:47,761 --> 00:57:51,753
A fuse blew and I had gone out of my skull.

763
00:58:00,873 --> 00:58:03,306
I'm telling my dad!

764
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:06,802
Hey, Ralphie!

765
00:58:13,654 --> 00:58:15,780
Beat him up! Beat him up!

766
00:58:30,269 --> 00:58:32,532
Did you hear what he said?

767
00:58:37,143 --> 00:58:39,576
I have since heard of people under...

768
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:43,341
extreme duress speaking in strange tongues.

769
00:58:43,649 --> 00:58:47,106
I became conscious that a steady torrent of obscenities...

770
00:58:47,286 --> 00:58:51,585
and swearing of all kinds was pouring out of me as I screamed.

771
00:59:00,434 --> 00:59:01,991
Ralphie!

772
00:59:18,885 --> 00:59:20,749
We're going home. Come on.

773
00:59:39,872 --> 00:59:42,840
Calm down. Come on in here, Ralph.

774
00:59:47,346 --> 00:59:48,778
Put your head down in here.

775
00:59:49,215 --> 00:59:51,375
Come on, get down in here.

776
00:59:52,485 --> 00:59:54,042
Settle down.

777
00:59:56,355 --> 01:00:00,085
I want you to go in there and lie down in your room for a while.

778
01:00:01,193 --> 01:00:03,319
Ralphie, just settle down.

779
01:00:07,032 --> 01:00:08,794
Here, dry off.

780
01:00:09,034 --> 01:00:11,001
All right, calm down.

781
01:00:11,136 --> 01:00:13,569
All right. Now go lie down.

782
01:00:33,326 --> 01:00:35,885
The light was getting purple and soft outside.

783
01:00:36,028 --> 01:00:38,860
Almost time for my father to come home from work.

784
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:00,841
What's the matter? What you crying for?

785
01:01:01,821 --> 01:01:04,254
Daddy's going to kill Ralphie.

786
01:01:04,857 --> 01:01:06,323
No, he's not.

787
01:01:06,459 --> 01:01:07,823
Yes, he is, too.

788
01:01:07,927 --> 01:01:09,484
No, he's not.

789
01:01:09,594 --> 01:01:13,791
I promise you Daddy is not going to kill Ralphie.

790
01:01:14,666 --> 01:01:16,189
Why don't you come on out of there?

791
01:01:19,771 --> 01:01:20,930
Would you like some milk?

792
01:01:22,807 --> 01:01:24,535
You would?

793
01:01:31,182 --> 01:01:32,375
Here you go.

794
01:01:33,718 --> 01:01:34,741
All right?

795
01:01:35,453 --> 01:01:38,182
I'll see you later? Okay. Bye.

796
01:01:50,502 --> 01:01:54,164
I heard the car roar up the driveway, and a wave of terror broke over me.

797
01:01:54,406 --> 01:01:57,431
He'll know what I said, the awful things that I said.

798
01:01:57,676 --> 01:01:59,472
Get out of here!

799
01:02:00,145 --> 01:02:03,409
Go on home, you mangy mutts. Get out of here, you rotten, filthy...

800
01:02:03,682 --> 01:02:04,409
Hey, Bumpus!

801
01:02:04,482 --> 01:02:06,949
Get over here and get your stinking dogs!

802
01:02:08,053 --> 01:02:11,112
Hey, come on, what's for dinner? I'm starving to death.

803
01:02:31,009 --> 01:02:33,636
Well, what happened today?

804
01:02:34,345 --> 01:02:35,675
Where's your glasses?

805
01:02:37,115 --> 01:02:38,775
Did you lose your glasses again?

806
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:40,081
Ralphie.

807
01:02:40,418 --> 01:02:43,511
Remember, you left these on the radio again.

808
01:02:43,754 --> 01:02:46,586
Now try not to do that anymore.

809
01:02:47,624 --> 01:02:49,181
So what else happened today?

810
01:02:50,694 --> 01:02:52,092
Nothing much.

811
01:02:52,296 --> 01:02:53,626
Ralphie had a fight.

812
01:02:54,431 --> 01:02:55,192
A fight?

813
01:02:55,399 --> 01:02:56,729
What kind of a fight?

814
01:02:59,169 --> 01:03:01,227
You know how boys are.

815
01:03:02,873 --> 01:03:04,772
I gave him a talking to.

816
01:03:06,176 --> 01:03:09,542
I see that the Bears are playing Green Bay on Sunday.

817
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:12,177
Oh, yeah.

818
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:14,374
Zudock's got tickets. I wish I had.

819
01:03:14,686 --> 01:03:16,585
He'll freeze his keister off out there.

820
01:03:19,656 --> 01:03:23,147
I slowly began to realize I was not about to be destroyed.

821
01:03:23,527 --> 01:03:24,993
The Chicago Bears.

822
01:03:25,596 --> 01:03:27,085
The terror of the midway.

823
01:03:28,065 --> 01:03:31,556
From then on, things were different between me and my mother.

824
01:03:33,837 --> 01:03:36,896
More like the Chicago Chipmunks, maybe.

825
01:03:37,074 --> 01:03:38,199
But Bears, never.

826
01:03:40,177 --> 01:03:41,165
Strange.

827
01:03:41,445 --> 01:03:45,175
Even something as monumental as "The Scut Farkus Affair"...

828
01:03:45,415 --> 01:03:46,938
as it came to be known...

829
01:03:47,116 --> 01:03:49,709
was pushed out of my mind as I struggled for a way out...

830
01:03:49,786 --> 01:03:52,618
of the impenetrable BB gun web...

831
01:03:52,689 --> 01:03:54,747
in which my mother had me trapped.

832
01:03:55,092 --> 01:03:56,183
Santa!

833
01:03:56,894 --> 01:03:58,622
Yeah, I'll ask Santa.

834
01:03:59,329 --> 01:04:00,989
Of course! Santa.

835
01:04:01,298 --> 01:04:03,356
The big man. The head honcho.

836
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:04,827
The connection.

837
01:04:05,102 --> 01:04:07,695
My mother had slipped up this time.

838
01:04:29,859 --> 01:04:31,485
Mickey!

839
01:04:48,545 --> 01:04:51,104
The store's going to close soon
and Santa will be gone.

840
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:55,206
Ralphie, Santa's not going anyplace. Just be still!

841
01:05:04,861 --> 01:05:07,294
Mom, this is just the same old dumb parade as last year.

842
01:05:07,396 --> 01:05:09,692
Ralphie, will you please calm down.

843
01:05:09,693 --> 01:05:10,592
Mom--

844
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:11,626
Hush!

845
01:05:11,627 --> 01:05:12,626
Shut up, Ralphie!

846
01:05:22,245 --> 01:05:23,040
There he is!

847
01:05:23,112 --> 01:05:25,272
Santa!

848
01:05:32,588 --> 01:05:35,078
Have you been a good boy? Have you?

849
01:05:35,224 --> 01:05:36,956
Can we go now? Can we go?

850
01:05:36,957 --> 01:05:38,056
Yes, we can go now.

851
01:05:38,194 --> 01:05:40,388
Come on, Ralphie.

852
01:05:52,041 --> 01:05:54,133
Merry Christmas!

853
01:05:56,845 --> 01:05:59,210
Come on, Randy, hurry up.

854
01:06:12,328 --> 01:06:14,522
Ralphie, look over there.

855
01:06:14,597 --> 01:06:17,622
See, the line's not so long. Get in it.

856
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,566
Take Randy's hand and hold on to him. We'll see you later, okay?

857
01:06:20,636 --> 01:06:23,798
Stay together, you hear? And don't get lost.

858
01:06:27,375 --> 01:06:28,466
Come on.

859
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:30,076
Let's go.

860
01:06:32,981 --> 01:06:34,607
Young man.

861
01:06:34,783 --> 01:06:35,908
Hey, kid.

862
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:38,044
Just where do you think you're going?

863
01:06:38,045 --> 01:06:39,844
We're going up to see Santa.

864
01:06:40,689 --> 01:06:43,486
The line ends here. It begins there.

865
01:06:43,926 --> 01:06:45,620
Merry Christmas!

866
01:06:45,828 --> 01:06:48,921
Come on, come up, boys and girls.
Hurry up.

867
01:06:54,837 --> 01:06:56,269
Come on.

868
01:07:00,175 --> 01:07:04,975
The line waiting to see Santa stretched all the way back to Terre Haute!

869
01:07:05,613 --> 01:07:07,512
And I was at the end of it.

870
01:07:09,851 --> 01:07:11,909
I like Santa.

871
01:07:16,291 --> 01:07:18,485
Let's face it. Most of us were scoffers.

872
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:23,587
Moments before zero hour, it did not pay to take chances.

873
01:07:24,533 --> 01:07:28,662
The chocolate snowman eats little boys.

874
01:07:30,405 --> 01:07:31,962
My pretty...

875
01:07:32,207 --> 01:07:34,333
What a tasty little boy.

876
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:38,510
Don't bother me. I'm thinking.

877
01:07:42,917 --> 01:07:45,043
I like The Wizard of Oz.

878
01:07:48,323 --> 01:07:50,256
I like the Tin Man.

879
01:07:54,462 --> 01:07:58,557
If Higbee thinks I'm working one minute past 9:00, he can kiss my foot.

880
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:02,259
Come on up on Santa's lap.

881
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:06,805
There's a wet one. And what's your name, little boy?

882
01:08:07,008 --> 01:08:07,996
Billy.

883
01:08:08,076 --> 01:08:09,269
Come on, Randy.

884
01:08:10,845 --> 01:08:14,041
And what do you want for Christmas, Billy? A toy truck?

885
01:08:14,149 --> 01:08:16,082
Get him off my lap.

886
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,013
Quick, get me a towel.

887
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,852
I hate the smell of tapioca.

888
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:32,832
Attention shoppers! It is now 9:00 and our store is closing.

889
01:08:33,233 --> 01:08:36,167
9:00! Great Scott! The store is gonna close!

890
01:08:37,204 --> 01:08:39,797
Santa can't wait all night.

891
01:08:40,374 --> 01:08:42,466
Come on up on Santa's lap.

892
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:53,378
Get moving, kid.

893
01:08:54,722 --> 01:08:56,416
Quit dragging your feet.

894
01:09:09,536 --> 01:09:11,093
Get him out of here.

895
01:09:21,815 --> 01:09:23,577
Come on, kid.

896
01:09:29,656 --> 01:09:32,146
Come on up.

897
01:09:42,503 --> 01:09:45,994
And what's your name, little boy?

898
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:49,575
Hey, kid, hurry up, the store's closing!

899
01:09:52,613 --> 01:09:57,276
Listen, little boy, we got a lot of people waiting here, so get going!

900
01:09:59,486 --> 01:10:02,454
What do you want for Christmas, little boy?

901
01:10:02,823 --> 01:10:04,915
My mind had gone blank.

902
01:10:05,058 --> 01:10:07,287
Frantically I tried to remember what it was I wanted.

903
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,917
I was blowing it, blowing it.

904
01:10:11,964 --> 01:10:15,023
How about a nice football?

905
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:18,160
Football. What's a football?

906
01:10:18,872 --> 01:10:20,998
Without conscious will, my voice squeaked out:

907
01:10:21,108 --> 01:10:22,335
Football.

908
01:10:22,876 --> 01:10:24,467
Okay, get him out of here.

909
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:28,344
A football! Oh, no. What was I doing?

910
01:10:28,415 --> 01:10:30,780
Wake up, stupid, wake up!

911
01:10:38,592 --> 01:10:41,685
I want an official Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot...

912
01:10:41,794 --> 01:10:42,851
range model air rifle.

913
01:10:44,931 --> 01:10:46,625
You'll shoot your eye out, kid.

914
01:10:48,367 --> 01:10:50,163
Merry Christmas.

915
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:07,682
I'll see you in Oz, folks.

916
01:11:16,262 --> 01:11:18,229
Well, did you see Santa Claus?

917
01:11:18,798 --> 01:11:21,231
Did you tell him what you wanted for Christmas?

918
01:11:21,334 --> 01:11:25,064
Did he ask you if you'd been a good boy all year?

919
01:11:25,471 --> 01:11:26,198
No.

920
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:29,165
Don't worry, he knows.

921
01:11:29,875 --> 01:11:31,398
He always knows.

922
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:36,807
Merry Christmas.

923
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:40,081
Okay, down you go.

924
01:11:40,354 --> 01:11:41,513
Bye, Chris.

925
01:11:51,864 --> 01:11:54,161
That's fine.

926
01:11:54,967 --> 01:11:57,526
Now wait a minute. All right. Plug her in!

927
01:11:59,438 --> 01:12:01,064
Well, the green string is out.

928
01:12:01,173 --> 01:12:03,436
No, the green is on. It's the blue that's out.

929
01:12:03,709 --> 01:12:05,801
Oh, don't tell me what color it is.

930
01:12:05,911 --> 01:12:07,070
I'm not color blind.

931
01:12:07,847 --> 01:12:09,336
I'm not color blind, either.

932
01:12:13,019 --> 01:12:14,508
There, see, I told you it was green.

933
01:12:17,022 --> 01:12:19,148
Hold it! Don't anybody move!

934
01:12:20,626 --> 01:12:22,024
Hold it right there!

935
01:12:22,662 --> 01:12:24,424
A fuse is out.

936
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:28,626
The old man could replace fuses quicker than a jackrabbit on a date.

937
01:12:28,701 --> 01:12:30,327
He bought them by the gross.

938
01:12:36,242 --> 01:12:37,970
Oh, Ralph.

939
01:12:38,277 --> 01:12:40,642
My, isn't that pretty?

940
01:12:40,813 --> 01:12:42,109
That son of a gun.

941
01:12:44,083 --> 01:12:45,276
Yeah. No.

942
01:12:45,418 --> 01:12:47,078
That star is crooked.

943
01:12:47,352 --> 01:12:49,285
That star is perfectly straight.

944
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:53,282
Oh, you've got to be careful.

945
01:12:53,283 --> 01:12:53,882
I am.

946
01:12:56,594 --> 01:12:59,721
It's just... Let me get it fixed. That's all right.

947
01:13:05,805 --> 01:13:07,328
Perfect.

948
01:13:10,209 --> 01:13:12,039
Oh, goodness, look at the time.

949
01:13:12,111 --> 01:13:14,101
I hope Santa hasn't had to pass up this house...

950
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:17,205
just because some boys weren't in bed when he came by.

951
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:19,943
I thought I heard Santa's sleigh bells...

952
01:13:20,018 --> 01:13:22,542
a little while ago, going up the other side of the street.

953
01:13:23,621 --> 01:13:24,951
All right, you two, upstairs.

954
01:13:26,091 --> 01:13:28,115
Go on the double, on the double.

955
01:13:39,637 --> 01:13:40,728
Okay, let's get them.

956
01:14:44,102 --> 01:14:46,160
Randy, come on! Get up, Randy!

957
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,972
Santa Claus had come!

958
01:15:02,553 --> 01:15:04,747
Wow! A truck! That's mine!

959
01:15:05,322 --> 01:15:07,551
Wow, look over here! That's mine!

960
01:15:07,624 --> 01:15:09,113
What's in here?

961
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:10,483
It's hard.

962
01:15:10,829 --> 01:15:13,888
Fire truck. Oh boy, that's mine!

963
01:15:22,974 --> 01:15:24,270
Does this raise?

964
01:15:39,456 --> 01:15:40,683
Merry Christmas.

965
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:44,490
Merry Christmas, you two.

966
01:15:45,295 --> 01:15:47,990
Randy, no. Wait for Christmas to start, honey.

967
01:15:48,432 --> 01:15:49,891
I want to play Santa!

968
01:15:49,892 --> 01:15:51,491
Well, wait a minute, Randy.

969
01:15:51,568 --> 01:15:53,467
He played Santa last year, didn't he?

970
01:15:53,838 --> 01:15:55,964
Ralphie, you play Santa this time.

971
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:57,073
Come on, Ralphie.

972
01:15:57,074 --> 01:15:58,173
Who should I start with?

973
01:15:58,475 --> 01:16:00,772
Well, give Randy a present.

974
01:16:00,878 --> 01:16:05,041
And, I think I see Aunt Clara's gift to you right over there.

975
01:16:05,148 --> 01:16:07,581
She always sends you such wonderful presents.

976
01:16:07,951 --> 01:16:10,646
Give me mine, Ralphie! Come on.

977
01:16:27,538 --> 01:16:32,031
Christmas had come. Officially. We plunged into the cornucopia...

978
01:16:32,108 --> 01:16:35,975
quivering with desire and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice.

979
01:16:36,113 --> 01:16:37,545
Didn't I get a tie this year?

980
01:16:44,688 --> 01:16:46,286
A zeppelin!

981
01:16:46,287 --> 01:16:47,986
A can of Simonize.

982
01:16:48,792 --> 01:16:51,954
Ralphie, what did Aunt Clara give you? Show everybody.

983
01:16:57,134 --> 01:16:57,997
I don't want to.

984
01:16:58,602 --> 01:17:01,035
Ralphie, show everybody what Aunt Clara gave you.

985
01:17:01,971 --> 01:17:04,803
Aunt Clara had for years labored under the delusion that...

986
01:17:04,874 --> 01:17:09,401
I was not only perpetually four years old, but also a girl.

987
01:17:09,912 --> 01:17:13,779
She just always gives you the nicest things, Ralphie.

988
01:17:18,288 --> 01:17:21,085
Oh, isn't that sweet?

989
01:17:21,525 --> 01:17:23,222
Ralph, go upstairs and try it on you--

990
01:17:23,223 --> 01:17:24,322
I don't want to!

991
01:17:24,428 --> 01:17:26,827
Go upstairs right now and try on that present!

992
01:17:26,930 --> 01:17:30,296
She went to all that trouble to make it! Now go on.

993
01:17:37,974 --> 01:17:42,137
While Ralphie is changing, I'm going to play Santa Claus.

994
01:17:42,211 --> 01:17:43,837
Now, let me see what can I find.

995
01:17:44,046 --> 01:17:47,606
I see something! Randy.

996
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:49,612
This is for you, honey.

997
01:17:50,486 --> 01:17:52,419
And this is for Daddy.

998
01:17:55,358 --> 01:17:56,051
Here.

999
01:17:56,125 --> 01:17:57,989
From me to you.

1000
01:18:00,263 --> 01:18:02,093
Thanks a lot.

1001
01:18:02,499 --> 01:18:04,728
I wonder what it could be?

1002
01:18:05,735 --> 01:18:08,726
Only one way to find out, isn't there?

1003
01:18:09,005 --> 01:18:11,199
Well, it's a blue ball!

1004
01:18:12,875 --> 01:18:14,637
It's a bowling ball.

1005
01:18:15,645 --> 01:18:16,906
Thank you, darling.

1006
01:18:17,013 --> 01:18:18,540
Do you like it?

1007
01:18:18,541 --> 01:18:20,140
Yes, very much. Very much.

1008
01:18:20,850 --> 01:18:21,747
Ralphie.

1009
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,975
We're waiting.

1010
01:18:24,153 --> 01:18:25,710
Oh, come on, Mom.

1011
01:18:26,155 --> 01:18:27,815
Right now!

1012
01:18:37,899 --> 01:18:41,527
Lmmediately my feet began to sweat as those two fluffy little bunnies...

1013
01:18:41,603 --> 01:18:44,969
with the blue button eyes stared sappily up at me.

1014
01:18:45,708 --> 01:18:48,403
Come down here so I can see you better.

1015
01:18:49,245 --> 01:18:51,041
I just hoped Flick would never spot them...

1016
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:54,478
as the word of this humiliation could easily make life...

1017
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:57,382
at Warren G. Harding School a veritable hell.

1018
01:18:59,822 --> 01:19:00,810
Isn't that cute?

1019
01:19:01,490 --> 01:19:05,118
That is the most precious thing I've ever seen in my life.

1020
01:19:05,928 --> 01:19:06,825
Shut up, Randy.

1021
01:19:07,829 --> 01:19:09,921
He looks like a deranged Easter bunny.

1022
01:19:12,133 --> 01:19:13,027
He does not!

1023
01:19:13,028 --> 01:19:13,827
He does, too.

1024
01:19:13,902 --> 01:19:15,596
He looks like a pink nightmare.

1025
01:19:16,271 --> 01:19:18,261
Are you happy wearing that?

1026
01:19:18,606 --> 01:19:19,594
Do you want to take it off?

1027
01:19:19,808 --> 01:19:21,035
You tell the kid to take it off.

1028
01:19:21,109 --> 01:19:24,077
You'll only wear it when Aunt Clara visits. Go on and take it off.

1029
01:19:24,145 --> 01:19:25,805
Take it off!

1030
01:19:29,418 --> 01:19:31,317
My God, will you look at that mess?

1031
01:19:31,721 --> 01:19:33,354
Who's going to clean the papers up?

1032
01:19:33,355 --> 01:19:34,154
Not me.

1033
01:19:35,558 --> 01:19:36,789
Randy did it last year.

1034
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:37,889
Well, he can do it again.

1035
01:19:40,462 --> 01:19:43,362
You know, this wine is not bad. It's not good either, but...

1036
01:19:43,431 --> 01:19:44,690
You want a sip?

1037
01:19:44,691 --> 01:19:45,990
No, you don't.

1038
01:19:47,469 --> 01:19:48,560
Did you have a nice Christmas?

1039
01:19:49,304 --> 01:19:50,270
Yeah, pretty nice.

1040
01:19:50,371 --> 01:19:51,837
Did you get everything you wanted?

1041
01:19:52,807 --> 01:19:54,468
Well, almost.

1042
01:19:54,469 --> 01:19:55,468
Almost?

1043
01:19:55,577 --> 01:19:57,203
Well, that's life.

1044
01:19:57,879 --> 01:19:59,573
Well, there's always next Christmas.

1045
01:20:02,817 --> 01:20:04,181
That's funny.

1046
01:20:05,086 --> 01:20:06,882
What's that over there behind the desk?

1047
01:20:07,923 --> 01:20:08,854
Where?

1048
01:20:08,924 --> 01:20:10,754
Behind the desk, against the wall over there.

1049
01:20:13,595 --> 01:20:14,925
Why don't you go check it out?

1050
01:20:31,613 --> 01:20:32,909
What did we put over there, honey?

1051
01:20:34,382 --> 01:20:36,474
Santa Claus probably put it.

1052
01:21:13,353 --> 01:21:17,186
Oh, it was beautiful. I could hardly wait to try it out.

1053
01:21:17,958 --> 01:21:19,618
Do you know how to load it?

1054
01:21:23,063 --> 01:21:24,324
That's right.

1055
01:21:32,006 --> 01:21:32,903
Be careful.

1056
01:21:33,374 --> 01:21:34,806
Don't. They run all over.

1057
01:21:41,649 --> 01:21:42,910
Close her up. Close it up.

1058
01:21:43,985 --> 01:21:46,680
Can I try it out, Ma? Can I?

1059
01:21:46,787 --> 01:21:47,553
Sure.

1060
01:21:47,554 --> 01:21:48,253
Okay.

1061
01:21:48,722 --> 01:21:49,847
But outside.

1062
01:21:49,957 --> 01:21:51,821
I still say those things are dangerous.

1063
01:21:53,327 --> 01:21:55,920
Put on your galoshes and your coat. It's cold out.

1064
01:21:59,366 --> 01:22:02,300
I had one when I was eight years old.

1065
01:22:02,903 --> 01:22:05,427
What if he hurts himself? Ralphie, your coat!

1066
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:08,641
Don't shoot any animals or birds!

1067
01:22:08,642 --> 01:22:10,641
Except the Bumpuses' dogs!

1068
01:22:12,246 --> 01:22:14,236
Be careful, Ralphie!

1069
01:22:14,916 --> 01:22:18,009
Now it is well known throughout the Midwest that the old man...

1070
01:22:18,085 --> 01:22:19,949
is a turkey junkie.

1071
01:22:20,821 --> 01:22:25,120
A bona fide garley turkicanus freak. A few days before Christmas...

1072
01:22:25,259 --> 01:22:29,354
his eyes would begin to gleam with a wild and ravenous light.

1073
01:22:33,333 --> 01:22:37,632
Okay, Black Bart, now you get yours.

1074
01:22:51,617 --> 01:22:53,550
Oh, my God! I shot my eye out!

1075
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:55,276
You'll shoot your eye out, kid.

1076
01:22:55,755 --> 01:23:00,020
You'll shoot your eye out, you'll shoot your eye out!

1077
01:23:00,961 --> 01:23:04,157
Ralphie, you be careful out there. Don't shoot your eye out!

1078
01:23:04,231 --> 01:23:06,289
She hadn't seen! She didn't know!

1079
01:23:06,934 --> 01:23:09,527
My eye's all right. The BB must've hit my glasses.

1080
01:23:10,938 --> 01:23:12,632
My glasses! Oh, no!

1081
01:23:12,706 --> 01:23:14,366
Where are my glasses?

1082
01:23:16,009 --> 01:23:18,772
Few things brought such swift and terrible retribution...

1083
01:23:18,879 --> 01:23:21,847
on a kid as a pair of busted glasses!

1084
01:23:26,185 --> 01:23:27,446
Stop!

1085
01:23:39,666 --> 01:23:41,132
Oh, no!

1086
01:23:43,603 --> 01:23:45,866
Oh, no! Pulverized.

1087
01:23:57,750 --> 01:24:01,913
For a moment I thought, I'll fake it. They'll never know the lens is gone!

1088
01:24:04,590 --> 01:24:07,422
Randomly, my mind evolved a spectacular plot.

1089
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:09,786
Let's see, an icicle!

1090
01:24:10,129 --> 01:24:12,494
Falls off the garage and hits me in the eye!

1091
01:24:12,832 --> 01:24:17,029
It would work. It had to work. Quickly, I whipped up some tears.

1092
01:24:23,309 --> 01:24:26,072
What's the matter, honey? What happened?

1093
01:24:26,145 --> 01:24:27,372
What happened? Let me see that.

1094
01:24:27,446 --> 01:24:31,211
There was this icicle and it fell off the garage and it hit me.

1095
01:24:35,588 --> 01:24:36,418
What is it?

1096
01:24:36,419 --> 01:24:38,818
No, it's okay. Just read your funnies.

1097
01:24:42,995 --> 01:24:44,484
Wake up, Randy.

1098
01:24:49,268 --> 01:24:50,598
Oh, God.

1099
01:24:50,770 --> 01:24:53,829
It hit my cheek and it broke my glasses.

1100
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:58,036
And I tried to get out of the way, but I...

1101
01:24:59,978 --> 01:25:03,879
There, see, it's just a little bump.

1102
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:05,910
You're lucky it didn't cut your eye.

1103
01:25:05,985 --> 01:25:08,111
Those icicles have been known to kill people.

1104
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:16,060
What's going on up there?

1105
01:25:16,061 --> 01:25:17,760
Nothing. We'll be right down.

1106
01:25:18,064 --> 01:25:20,725
You stay away from that turkey! It's got an hour to cook.

1107
01:25:20,833 --> 01:25:21,992
You'll get worms!

1108
01:25:27,172 --> 01:25:28,661
But what about my glasses?

1109
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:31,571
You can wear the old ones with the crack in them...

1110
01:25:31,643 --> 01:25:33,473
until we get you some new ones.

1111
01:25:36,314 --> 01:25:38,213
I had pulled it off!

1112
01:25:39,617 --> 01:25:41,481
But I left my gun outside.

1113
01:25:42,787 --> 01:25:45,653
When you get dressed you can go out and get your gun.

1114
01:25:45,857 --> 01:25:47,221
Hold that on there.

1115
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:49,317
Life is like that.

1116
01:25:49,795 --> 01:25:54,731
Sometimes at the height of our reveries, when our joy is at its zenith...

1117
01:25:54,834 --> 01:25:57,734
when all is most right with the world...

1118
01:25:57,870 --> 01:26:01,202
the most unthinkable disasters descend upon us.

1119
01:26:16,654 --> 01:26:18,211
Oh, turkey!

1120
01:26:33,071 --> 01:26:36,267
Sons a bitches! Bumpuses!

1121
01:26:51,489 --> 01:26:55,083
The heavenly aroma still hung heavy in the house. But it was gone.

1122
01:26:55,226 --> 01:26:58,251
All gone. No turkey. No turkey sandwiches.

1123
01:26:58,329 --> 01:27:02,355
No turkey salad. No turkey gravy, turkey hash, turkey a la king...

1124
01:27:02,466 --> 01:27:03,762
or gallons of turkey soup.

1125
01:27:03,834 --> 01:27:04,561
Gone.

1126
01:27:04,635 --> 01:27:05,896
All gone.

1127
01:27:10,541 --> 01:27:11,529
All right.

1128
01:27:12,010 --> 01:27:12,907
Everybody upstairs.

1129
01:27:13,144 --> 01:27:14,440
Get dressed.

1130
01:27:16,614 --> 01:27:18,103
We are going out to eat.

1131
01:27:42,406 --> 01:27:46,865
No! Not, "ra ra ra ra ra." "La la la la la."

1132
01:27:47,277 --> 01:27:48,072
Sing like this:

1133
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:58,010
Try again.

1134
01:28:08,031 --> 01:28:09,224
Stop!

1135
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,762
Sing something else.

1136
01:28:25,349 --> 01:28:26,406
No!

1137
01:28:26,483 --> 01:28:27,574
Stop!

1138
01:28:28,452 --> 01:28:30,715
Kitchen. Bring food. For customers.

1139
01:28:39,863 --> 01:28:41,193
Oh, I'm sorry.

1140
01:28:44,034 --> 01:28:45,694
It's a beautiful duck.

1141
01:28:46,103 --> 01:28:47,763
It really is.

1142
01:28:48,572 --> 01:28:50,198
But you see...

1143
01:28:52,709 --> 01:28:53,504
What?

1144
01:28:53,577 --> 01:28:55,544
It's smiling at me.

1145
01:29:01,118 --> 01:29:02,209
Okay?

1146
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:05,052
Beautiful!

1147
01:29:08,591 --> 01:29:10,615
That Christmas would live in our memories...

1148
01:29:10,726 --> 01:29:14,161
as the Christmas when we were introduced to Chinese turkey.

1149
01:29:15,598 --> 01:29:17,588
All was right with the world.

1150
01:29:38,555 --> 01:29:40,852
Oh, honey, come over here. Look at this.

1151
01:29:41,691 --> 01:29:43,658
Is that beautiful!

1152
01:30:29,605 --> 01:30:33,870
Next to me in the blackness lay my oiled blue-steel beauty.

1153
01:30:34,643 --> 01:30:36,974
The greatest Christmas gift I had ever received...

1154
01:30:37,079 --> 01:30:38,511
or would ever receive.

1155
01:30:39,682 --> 01:30:43,344
Gradually, I drifted off to sleep, pranging ducks on the wing...

1156
01:30:43,420 --> 01:30:45,944
and getting off spectacular hip shots.
