00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:45,150
这些年来，我有很多的称谓
恶魔之猫，毛毛爱人
<i>Through the years I have been known by many names.
Diablo Gato, The Furry Lover...</i>

4
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,950
卓柏卡布拉（一种吸血怪物），超级活宝
<i>... Chupa Cabra, Frisky Two Times ...</i>

5
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,950
还有活力猛猫
<i>... and then The Gingerhead man.</i>

6
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,550
但大多数人叫我：穿靴子的猫
<i>But to most I am Puss in Boots,</i>

7
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,250
法外之徒
<i>Outlaw!</i>

8
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,750
永远牵挂你，玛格丽塔…
I'll never forget you, Margarita ...

9
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:44,150
我是说…罗莎
抱歉，我想我该走了
I mean ... Rosa.
Sorry. I think maybe I should go.

10
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,950
我会抓到你的！穿靴子的猫！
You cannot run forever, Puss in Boots!

11
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,550
这就是我，一只小坏猫
<i>What can I say? I was a bad kitty.</i>

12
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,850
作为通缉犯，逃亡奔走
<i>... just a fugitive from the law,
forever running</i>

13
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,050
试图洗刷罪名
<i>Searching for a way to clear my name.</i>

14
00:02:51,423 --> 00:02:53,837
【片名：穿靴子的猫】

15
00:02:54,550 --> 00:03:00,250
而今晚，上天给了我这个机会
<i>And I would get that chance 
on this one fateful night.</i>

16
00:03:06,976 --> 00:03:10,124
（火焰节）

17
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:14,107
（也是鸡肉节）

18
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,550
小猫猫
Kitty-kitty!

19
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,050
拉乌尔，看它和猫一样窝囊
哦，等等，它本来就是猫
Raoul, look what the cat dragged in.
Oh, wait! That is the cat!

20
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,750
一杯牛奶，谢谢
Bottle of leche, please.

21
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:14,350
您来这里有何贵干，先生？
在找毛线团吗？
<i>What are you doing here,  Senor ?
Did you lose your ball of thread</i>

22
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,050
很好笑
So funny!

23
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,250
牛奶马上来
One leche coming up!

24
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,350
我不想生事
<i>I am not looking for trouble.</i>

25
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,550
我只是一只找寻下一餐的卑微的猫
I am but a humble gato 
in search of his next meal.

26
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,950
也许各位绅士能给我指条路
Perhaps you gentlemen 
can let me find a simple score.

27
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:57,250
你今晚能找到的只有麻烦，穿靴子的猫
The only thing you'll find tonight 
is trouble, Puss in Boots.

28
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,350
或许我们有人会报官
Well perhaps if one of us 
were to tell the law 

29
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,250
说你回来了，我们就能平分赏金了
that you're in town, 
we could split the reward.

30
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:28,950
你们惹猫生气了
你们不会喜欢猫生气的
You made the cat angry...
You do not want to make the cat angry!

31
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,750
圣米迦勒教堂新建了一个纯金雕像
The church if St. Michael has just put up 
a golden statue of,

32
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,250
圣母瓜达卢佩
The Virgin of Guadalupe.

33
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,350
我不沾教堂的钱！
I do not steal from churches!

34
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,350
那，有人给孤儿院捐赠了银烛台
Well, the boys orphanage has been donated 
silver candlesticks,

35
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,050
它们很适合你家
they would look very lovely in your home!

36
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,250
孤儿院也不是我的菜！
I do not steal from orphans!

37
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,250
- 那杰克和吉尔如何？
- 嘘！你疯啦？
- Uh...what about Jack and Jill?
- Shh! Are you crazy?

38
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,950
说下去！
The what?

39
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:00,450
在逃杀人犯，杰克和吉尔
他们手上有魔豆
The murderous outlaws, Jack and Jill, 
have gotten their hands on magic beans.

40
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,950
别拿魔豆和我开玩笑！
Do not joke with me about magic beans!

41
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,450
我找了它们半辈子，他们不存在
I searched half my life for them. 
They do not exist.

42
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,850
不，猫，我亲眼见过
No, cat...
We have seen them!

43
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:15,150
这些传说中的魔豆…
These are the beans of legends...

44
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:23,950
它们的蔓藤疯长到达巨人的领地
还有下金蛋的鹅
Grows the vine to the land of giants.
And the golden goose...

45
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,050
下金蛋的鹅
golden goose...

46
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,050
是啊，就能下半生极尽奢华
Yeah, it's like this could set you up for life.

47
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,550
你的9个下半生，给他看看金蛋蛋
All nine of them. Show him the golden eggs!

48
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,950
别！
No!

49
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,750
那个…好了…已经看够了
Please uh...you have uh...shown enough.

50
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:43,250
你要想死就去偷吧
Only a cat with a death wish 
would steal the beans from Jack and Jill.

51
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:49,350
我想的只是还一笔旧债
The only wish I have 
is to repay an old debt.

52
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,850
而现在机会来了
and this is my chance.

53
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,750
所以
Now ...

54
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,450
杰克和吉尔在哪？
Where to I find this Jack and Jill?

55
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,650
抱歉，没有空房了
Sorry, we have no rooms.

56
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,750
我想有人退房了
I think one just overcomed.

57
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,250
赠送的早餐要欧式的
We'd like a complimentary continental breakfast.

58
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,950
还有别想在小松饼上给我减料
And do not even think about
skimping on them baby muffins!

59
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,850
杰克和吉尔夫妇
Jack and Jill Mr. and Mrs..

60
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,450
人家这里不供应小松饼啊
We do not have any baby muffins!

61
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:14,550
- 吉尔，我考虑很久了
- 嗯，快说吧
- You know, Jill, I've been thinking
- Uuhh! Get it out.

62
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,950
我…等魔豆这票干完了
I um...once we're done 
with this magic bean business

63
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,150
拿到了值钱的金蛋
and got ourselves all them beautiful golden eggs.

64
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,750
然后呢？
Mmhmm. Go on.

65
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,050
我们何必继续抢劫和杀人呢？
Why don't we cut down on 
some of the hijackin' and murderin'.

66
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,050
我知道这样很好玩，但是…
I mean it's fun and all, but uh...

67
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,650
我想要个孩子
... I want a baby.

68
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,850
- 什么孩子，杰克？
- 我们的孩子，吉尔
<i>- A baby what, Jack?
- A baby of ours, Jill.</i>

69
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,050
我们会把他抚养得很狂野，就像松鼠似的
<i>We'll raise it wild, 
like a squirrel or somethin'.</i>

70
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,350
我的豆豆啊，它们是真的
Holy frijoles ...
They do exist!

71
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,650
自打你从山上跌下来摔坏了下巴
就开始说胡话了
Ever since you fell on that hill and
broke your crown, you've been talking crazy

72
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,350
嘿！搞啥？
Hey, what gives?

73
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,150
不！
No!

74
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,450
你你你，呆在哪儿别动！
You, you ... you stop where you are!

75
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,950
那些豆子是我的！
Those beans are mine!

76
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,050
我？
Me?

77
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,550
你？掐死我？
You, snap me?

78
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,650
你！？掐死我？！
You snap me?!

79
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,250
找什么呢？
You looking for something?

80
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,250
没
No.

81
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,450
俺不懂鹰语
<i>No hablo Ingles.</i>

82
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,150
你要为此付出代价！
You are going to pay for that!

83
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,250
卓柏卡布拉！
Chupacabra!

84
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,050
- 卓柏卡布拉！
- 你脑子被驴踢了！
- Chupacabra!
- You are crazy, woman!

85
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,350
这些魔豆是，我的，猎物
Those magic beans were my score.

86
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,850
你害我失去了得到金蛋的良机，伙计
<i>You just caused me a chance 
of getting the golden eggs, mi amigo.</i>

87
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,550
伸爪吧
Put up your paws up!

88
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:49,876
（周二之夜，比舞决斗）

89
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,050
非常好…
Very well ...

90
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,950
既然是比舞决斗
If it is to be a dance fight,

91
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,350
那我就在周二之夜的比舞决斗上
让你死而无憾
Then I will tuesday night dance fight you 
to the death!

92
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,450
你胆敢对我作这个动作！
How dare you do the litter box on me!

93
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,450
感觉到我了么？
Can you feel me?

94
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,350
够胆的话，畏惧我吧
Fear me if you dare!

95
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,850
你用吉他打我的头？
You hit me in the head with a guitar?

96
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,150
你…你是母猫？
You ... you are a woman?

97
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,850
真不专业
Amateur!

98
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,850
小姐，等等！
Wow! Senorita, wait! 

99
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:50,350
能赏脸让我请你喝杯奶吗？
我很有爱，并不…暴力
Let me buy you some leche! 
I am a lover not a...fighter.

100
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:58,250
有人吗？在和我躲猫猫吗？
Hello? You are hiding from me? 

101
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:05,250
我也很喜欢玩游戏哦
我感觉我们气味相投啊
I like to play the games too.
I sense in you a kindred spirit.

102
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,750
这气味很熟悉
I smell something familiar.

103
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,650
闻起来很危险
something dangerous.

104
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,550
闻起来像早餐
something breakfasty.

105
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,950
很久不见啊，兄弟
It's been a long time, brother.

106
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,450
该死的蛋！
Maldito Huevo!

107
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:39,250
矮蛋・亚历山大
Humpty Alexander Dumpty...

108
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,350
你怎敢出现在我面前？
How dare you show your face to me!

109
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,850
我知道你很生气，你应该生气
I know you're angry,
you have every right.

110
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,950
但我真的很高兴见到你，猫
But it is good to see you, Puss!

111
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,950
穿的新靴子吗？
Are those new boots?

112
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:56,350
不！还是你出卖我时穿的那双
No! They are the same boots 
I wore when you betrayed me.

113
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,150
背叛你？
Be...betrayed you? 

114
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,850
你留下心碎的我在那座桥上
还被卫兵围捕
You left me cracked in pieces on a bridge, 
surrounded by soldiers.

115
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,350
他们还为此写了首歌
They wrote a song about it.

116
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,750
那我们是为什么会到那座桥上的？
And how did we get on that bridge 
in the first place?!

117
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,850
因为我们是兄弟
而兄弟就应该互相照顾对方，不是…
Because we were brothers and 
brothers are supposed to look after each other. Not...

118
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,350
矮蛋
Humpty

119
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,250
不要把正事忘了
Remember why we're here

120
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,150
我早该料到
I should have known.

121
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,750
魔豆当时已经在我掌控中
而你派这只…
I had the magic beans in 
my grasp and you sent this very...

122
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,150
小魅魔来干涉我
attractive devil woman to interfere

123
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,750
你就是我一生的诅咒
You are a curse on my life!

124
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,650
等等，听我说完，好吗？
Woh! Woh! Wait! Here me out, okay? 

125
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,350
对，没错，我让咪咪带你来这里
Yes, yes! I sent Kitty to bring you here,

126
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,050
但她不是一般的窃贼
But she is no ordinary thief.

127
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:41,650
她是咪・柔爪
有全西班牙最柔软的爪子
She's Kitty Softpaws. 
The softest touch in Spain

128
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,850
男的穿这样高的根不舒服吧，不是吗？
That's a lot of heel for a guy, 
don't you think?

129
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,550
听好，有着咪的手段
你的剑术和我的头脑
Look, with Kitty's skill, 
your sword and my brain ,

130
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,350
我们有了千载难逢的机会啊
we've got a fighting chance here.

131
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,550
猫，拜托！
Puss, come on!

132
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,150
你们都知道没人能从巨人的城堡里偷走东西
You of all people know that nobody 
is ever ripped off the giant's castle 

133
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,150
还能活着回来的
and lived to tell the tale.

134
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,750
你想全身而退，就得有计划
You want to survive, 
you need a plan.

135
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,650
而我一生都在计划这件事
And I've studied this job my whole life, 

136
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,150
你知道的
you know that.

137
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,550
好吧，我们真诚相待
Alright, let's...let's...let's be honest, 

138
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,350
没有我你也不知道在哪里种魔豆，猫
without me you don't even know 
where to plant the beans, Puss.

139
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,850
但杰克和吉尔知道，他们已经启程了
But Jack and Jill do, they're on their way!

140
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,250
通缉犯爬上豆茎
We go up the beanstalk outlaws 

141
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,250
下来就成了传奇
and we come down legends. 

142
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,650
你意见如何？伙计？
So what do you say? Partner?

143
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,050
不，我不会再上当
No, never again.

144
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,150
对不起，好没？
你这仇要记恨多久啊？
I'm sorry, okay? 
How long are you going to hold a grudge? 

145
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,150
都7年了！
It's been seven years! 

146
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,650
差不多35个猫年了
That's like 35 cat years! 

147
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,650
你需要我！
You need me!

148
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,350
而且…我需要你，猫
And I...I need you, Puss.

149
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:53,150
你知道在圣里卡多的监狱里
他们怎么对蛋的吗？
You got any idea what they do 
to eggs in San Ricardo prison?

150
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:02,350
我来告诉你，朋友
可不像煎蛋那么简单
I'll tell you this, my friend. 
It ain't over-easy!

151
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,050
再见，矮蛋！
<i>Adios, Humpty Dumpty.!</i>

152
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,450
糟糕了，糟糕了
This is bad, this is bad!

153
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:22,850
别担心，我来对付他
我也是只猫猫哦
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
I know how to speak meow.

154
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,050
编的好
Such story,

155
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:28,050
说谎不打草稿
with your twisted lies...

156
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,350
我该当场把你敲碎！
I should crack you open for it

157
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,450
看看我找到啥了
<i>Look what I found</i>

158
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,450
有人忘记拿钱包哦
Someone forgot his money!

159
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,650
你真是很危险
You are dangerous ...

160
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,850
矮蛋说你喜欢冒险
Humpty says you like danger.

161
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:04,550
想想看，我们会遇到的危险
Just think of all trouble 
we can get into ...

162
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,550
我们俩，一起
The two of us, together,

163
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:14,250
我们能拿到不少的金蛋
We can steal a lot of golden eggs.

164
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:24,250
- 而且，你欠我的
- 我欠你啥？
- And... You owe me.
- I owe you?

165
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:30,150
- 你用吉他打了我
- 吉他很后悔
- You hit me in the head with a guitar.
- I regret the guitar.

166
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:35,350
好吧，我原谅你，那你加入吗？
Okay, I forgive you.
So ... You're in?

167
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,450
只有一个很小的微不足道的小问题
Only there's one tini tiny
itty bitty problem.

168
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,950
- 是什么呢？
- 你的老板，是矮蛋！
- And what is that?
- You work ... for the egg!

169
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,850
拜托啊，猫
Oh, come on, Puss! 

170
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,250
你和矮蛋之间到底发生了什么天大的事？
What happened between you and Humpty 
that was so bad?

171
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:59,750
恐怕我们俩之间，伤痕太深了
I am afraid with me and 
Humpty the scars are too deep. 

172
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,550
那是多年前的事情了
It all started a long time ago.

173
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,750
不不不不！你大可不必把整件事情都说完
Oh, no! No! No! No! You really don't have to 
tell me your whole life story, please!

174
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,050
请坐下，我详说
You may want to sit.

175
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:19,750
- 那是一段悲痛的日子
- 好吧，开始了
- It is at times quite...painful.
- Okay, here we go.

176
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:24,550
那是闹旱灾的一年
It was the year 
in which the rain had not fallen. 

177
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,550
大风呼啸，猫篮羸小
<i>The wind was big and 
the basket was small.</i>

178
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,750
随风颠簸，饥寒难消
<i>For days I bounced along</i>

179
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:37,450
没有妈妈没有酒吧
没有24小时奶喝的家
<i>A hungry little kitten with no milk, 
no mama and no litter box.</i>

180
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:41,650
直到我来到一个收留孤儿的地方
<i>Until I came to rest at a home 
for lost children..</i>

181
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,550
她的名字是伊梅尔达
<i>Her name was Imelda .</i>

182
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,150
如同母亲一般用心对待我
<i>and like a mother she took me 
into her heart </i>

183
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,050
如同亲生儿子一般
<i>and raised me as her own.</i>

184
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,350
都安静
Silensio ...

185
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,450
都安静！
Silensio!

186
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,650
她像天使般的温柔善良
<i>She was an angel of kindness...</i>

187
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,750
都安静！
Silensio!

188
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,350
大多数时候吧
<i>... most of the time.</i>

189
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,050
我要给大家介绍一个新来的同学
I would like to introduce a new boy joining us.

190
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:17,650
没事的，孩子，和大家见见面吧
It's okay, pequeno. You show the face.

191
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,150
去吧
Go on ...

192
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:34,250
- 就是那时我认识了…
- 矮蛋・亚历山大
<i>- And uh...that was the moment I met...
- Humpty Alexander Dumpty.</i>

193
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,850
长毛的，你坐在了蓝小子的座位上
Hey, whiskers!
You sit in the middle Boy Blue chair.

194
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,250
拜托，这有必要吗？
Come on! Is this necessary?

195
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,350
怎么不找个和你一样块头的欺负？
What don't you pick up somebody
your own size?

196
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,150
谁问你了，早餐？
Who asked you, breakfast?

197
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,050
还记得伊美尔达怎么说的吗？蓝小子
Remember what Imelda says, Boy Blue?

198
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,450
如果你怒发冲天，就用力吹你的号角
不是吗？
If you going to blow your top,
you blow your horn instead, right?

199
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,050
- 我们来玩转蛋蛋吧
- 请别转我
- Let spin him!
- Please don't spin me!

200
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,750
不要转我！我会散黄…
Not again! I'm gonna yolk!

201
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:00,650
虽然他拿了我的豆子，但他为我挺身而出
<i>Eventough he took my beans,
the egg stood up for me.</i>

202
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,750
那时我就决定了，我要永远保护他
<i>and I decided that I would always 
have his back.</i>

203
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,150
你真是太厉害了，谢谢
That was very impressive! Thanks!

204
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,450
蛋蛋男
Hey eggboy!

205
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:25,050
但这只奇怪的蛋总是…让我好奇
<i>It was something about this strange 
little egg that uh...intrigued me....</i>

206
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,750
是你啊
Oh, it's you...

207
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,250
我收集豆子都好几个月了
I've been collecting for months now.

208
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,750
你总不知道运气什么时候来，知道吗？
You never know when we're get lucky, 
you know what I mean?

209
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:53,050
魔豆，就是我要找的
Magic beans,
It's what they are.

210
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,050
喂？
Hello? 

211
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:58,550
你要向其他的孩子说我相信魔法吗？
You going to tell all the other kids 
that I believe in magic now? 

212
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,450
你正打算这样吗？
Is that what you're gonna do?

213
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,450
不吗？你叫什么名字？
No? What's your name?

214
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,550
你不怎么说话，对吧？
Well you don't say much, do you? 

215
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,150
我觉得就叫你闪闪
Well I think I'll call you Sparky.

216
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,250
毛毛？
Whiskers?

217
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,150
索尔塔！
（沉默的许愿机）
Zoltar!

218
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,050
那叫“猫”怎么样？
How about Puss?

219
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:22,450
他脑子里都是各种的幻想和冒险
<i>Humpty's mind was full of 
imagination and invention.</i>

220
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,350
有多高啊？15尺高吗？
What is it? 15 feet down there?

221
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,050
这就来吧，帮我推…
Here we go. Give me a pu...

222
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,050
我在飞！
I am flying!

223
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:40,050
他总是说着超乎我想象的传说和冒险
<i>He spoke of legends and adventures 
beyond my wildest dreams.</i>

224
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:45,850
党我找到那些魔法豆后，让它们长到云里
Oh, when I find those magic beans, 
they'll grow a vine straight up into the clouds ,

225
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:50,150
在那里有着可怕残忍的巨人
守护他最宝贵的宝藏，黄金之鹅
where a terrible and a fearsome giant 
hoards his greatest treasure, the golden goose

226
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,050
黄金鹅
Oh, the golden goose. 

227
00:24:53,150 --> 00:25:00,250
只要一颗，只要一颗她产下的金蛋
就够我一生享用了
Just one...just one of her golden eggs 
could set me for life.

228
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,950
这是我的使命，猫
It's my destiny, Puss.

229
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:08,450
我不知道怎么解释
但我总觉得，我属于那里的世界
I can't really explain it, 
but I just feel like I belong up there.

230
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,550
这有些难为情
Well, this is awkward. 

231
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:18,650
这只是…我个人的梦想
This is kind of uh...
a solo dream here

232
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,550
我的确不需要什么累赘，知道吗？
拖后腿的人
I don't really need a dead weight, you know?
Hold me down

233
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,550
你这是干什么？
我的天，太棒了
What are you doin'? Oh man, that's good. 

234
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,150
你眼睛的把戏，实在太棒了
The...the...the eye thing that you're doin', 
that is really splendid.

235
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,550
好了，让我再想一想，好吗？
Okay, let me just think for a second, alright? 

236
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:41,250
好吧，这太疯狂了
但我在想，想要一个搭档
Okay, uh...this is crazy 
but I am considering a partnership. 

237
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,150
但我还要知道一件事
I just need to know one thing. 

238
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:49,650
- 你能保证吗？
- 好，我能保证
- Can you commit?
- Si, I can commit.

239
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,950
你能说话啊
Oh, you can talk!

240
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,750
能帮我起来吗？
Could you help me up?

241
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:03,650
魔豆帮帮规第一条
不能谈起魔豆帮
First rule of bean club, 
you do not talk about bean club.

242
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,850
魔豆帮帮规第二条
Second rule of bean club, 

243
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,850
不能谈起魔豆帮
you don't talk about bean club.

244
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,150
- 准备好了？
- 好了
- You ready?
- Ready.

245
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,350
从今天开始到永远，我们会：
From this day forth, it shall be known.

246
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,850
永不落单，团结一致
Never alone, always together.

247
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,350
- 矮蛋和猫
- 永是兄弟
- Humpty and Puss...
- Brothers forever.

248
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,550
从那时起
<i>And from that moment on ,</i>

249
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,950
我们一起展开了伟大的冒险：寻找魔豆
<i>we were united on a great adventure 
to find the magic beans.</i>

250
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,450
扶我
Help me up!

251
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,850
贴蛋
Paint me!

252
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,850
矮蛋就是主脑
<i>Humpty was the brain...</i>

253
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,750
- 我的天啊！
- 我根本没看到他
- Good gracious!
- I never saw him!

254
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:37,750
真的好疼啊
It's really hurt!

255
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,450
而我就是执行者
<i>...and I was the skill.</i>

256
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,850
我们有红豆、绿豆、咖啡豆和利马豆
Well, we got red beans, we got green beans, 
coffee beans, lima beans 

257
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,850
但没有魔豆
but no Magic Beans.

258
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,150
- 要果冻豆吗？
- 要，谢谢
- Would you care for a jelly bean?
- Oh, thank you.

259
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,650
魔豆，就是我们的一切
<i>Finding them meant everything to us.</i>

260
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,050
我差点忘了最重要的哦
Oh, I Almost forgot the most important thing.

261
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,650
那就是我和你，猫
That's me and you, Puss... 

262
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,550
我和你
me and you.

263
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:07,350
但，我们从没找到
<i>But we never did find them.</i>

264
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,750
一年一年过去了，寻找魔豆的任务
<i>And as the years passed, 
the quest for magic beans </i>

265
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:14,950
越来越像孩子的梦想了
<i>seemed more and more 
like a dreams of a child.</i>

266
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,950
青年时，矮蛋和我总是惹事
<i>As teenagers, Humpty and I 
looked for trouble</i>

267
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,750
而结果就是
<i>and often found it.</i>

268
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:27,050
这个月第三次了，伊梅尔达
下一次我直接送监狱了
Third time this month, Imelda.
Next time, it's jail time.

269
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,150
他们还是孩子啊
But they're just kids...

270
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,950
他们是小偷！
They are thieves!

271
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:41,850
你们能有更大的作为
我一直从心里相信这点
You are better than this.
I believe in you with all my heart.

272
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,950
请不要让我失望
Please do not let me down.

273
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,550
我讨厌这地方
我等不及要离开这里了
I hate this place!
I can not wait for us to get out of here!

274
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,150
扔石头吧，能让你好受些
Throw a rock! It'll make you feel better.

275
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,850
天啊，该走了
Oh boy! we should go.

276
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,250
本能地，我行动了
<i>an instinct, I reacted</i>

277
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:21,050
- 他救了卫队长的妈妈
- 他救了卫队长的妈妈
- He saves the commandante's mother!
- He saves the commandante's mother!

278
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:23,643
他救了卫队长的妈妈哞~

279
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,550
你，救了我妈妈
You saved my mother!

280
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,650
猫先生
Senor Puss,

281
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,550
他是位英雄！
He is a hero!

282
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:39,050
今天我们看到了勇气和胆量
Today we see the courage and bravery!

283
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:45,750
那时我也不知道
我的人生在那时起就改变了
<i>Little did I know that one moment 
would change my whole life.</i>

284
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,650
这是给你的，我的孩子
These are for you, my boy.

285
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:53,350
穿上它们，代表着荣誉和正义
Wear them as a symbol of honor and justice.

286
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,150
我会让你骄傲的，妈妈
I will make you proud, mama.

287
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:02,250
你已经让我骄傲了，穿靴子的猫
You already have. My Puss in Boots.

288
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,250
一只猫穿靴子有多奇怪啊
<i>How strange it was to be a cat in boots,</i>

289
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,950
但我看起来真帅
<i>but woh, I look good!</i>

290
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,150
当我的人生路越来越明亮时
<i>And as the light of my path grew brighter,</i>

291
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,050
而他的人生路却越来越阴暗
<i>Humpty's road grew ever darker.</i>

292
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,050
谢谢你，卫队长
Gracias, Commandante!

293
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:30,250
小心选择你的伙伴
Be careful of the company you keep.

294
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,950
我知道，我知道我不该独自行动
I know. I know. I never should have tried 
something without you.

295
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:38,450
你不能再去偷棒棒糖了，矮蛋
我是说真的
You're not stealing lollipops anymore, Humpty. 
This is getting serious.

296
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,050
你说的对，我们应该做更精明的事
You're right!
We have to be smarter about this. 

297
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,550
听我说，我们要想得更远大
Here, look. We need to think bigger. 

298
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,350
我已经侦查过银匠铺了，很完美
I've been casing the silver smith 
and it's perfect.

299
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,950
你和我只需要50秒就完事
You and me, in and out, fifty seconds tops!

300
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,550
快把本子收起来！
Will you put that away! 

301
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:54,750
这是我们家
这些人没做过任何对不起我们的事
This is our home, 
these people have done nothing to us.

302
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:58,250
我们家？好了，我明白了
Our home?
Okay, yeah. I get it now. 

303
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:01,850
你有了双好靴子，你就比我强了？
You get some fancy boots 
and now you're too good for me?

304
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,650
- 不是那么回事
- 我们不在这儿出生，我们是孤儿
- That is not true.
- We weren't born here. We're orphans... 

305
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:09,850
- 我们只能相依为命，明白吗？
- 我们能更有作为
- and all we got is each other. You understand?
- We are better than this.

306
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:14,450
- 但我们是搭档啊
- 我们是兄弟
- But we're partners.
- We are brothers!

307
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,850
但我不会再偷东西了
But I am not stealing anymore.

308
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:23,150
但矮蛋却没那么容易放弃
<i>But Humpty would not give up so easily.</i>

309
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,450
我有麻烦了，猫
I'm in trouble, Puss!

310
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,850
是蓝小子的一个混混，我欠他一笔钱
It's boy blue and his gang
I owe him some money.

311
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,150
他们要来找我了，快帮我翻过这道墙
They're coming for me, 
just get me over this wall!

312
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,550
我们快走！帮我翻墙，快！
We got to go!
Help me up the wall! Hurry!

313
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:38,961
（圣里卡多银行）

314
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,750
好了，东西拿齐了，成功了
快走，走！
Okay, I got everything!
We did it! Come on, let's go!

315
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,550
- 你怎么能这样对我？
- 我帮了你大忙啊
- How could you do this to me?
- I did you a favor! 

316
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,550
- 我们终于可以离开这里了
- 这可是大家的钱啊
- We can finally get out of here.
- This is the money of the people. 

317
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,050
是他们所有的积蓄
This is all they have!

318
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:03,550
- 你！让这双靴子蒙羞！
- 卫队长！求求你，让我解释
- You disgrace those boots.
- Comandate, please! I can explain.

319
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,050
抓住他们！
Arrest them!

320
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,050
快！到桥那儿！
Hurry up! Go to the bridge!

321
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,350
- 你骗我！
- 我必须骗你，你让我别无选择
- You tricked me!
- I had too! You left me no choice!

322
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,150
妈妈
Mama ...

323
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,850
我的孩子
Pequeno

324
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:28,750
看路！
Watch out!

325
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,450
噢，不
Oh no ...

326
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:50,750
猫，我起不来，帮帮我，我起不来
Puss, I can't get up. 
Puss, help me I can't get up!

327
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,750
站住！
Freeze!

328
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:57,250
- 猫！救救我！
- 自己救自己吧
- Puss, save me!
- Save yourself!

329
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:18,250
在那一天，我失去了我在乎的一切
<i>I lost everything I cared about that day.</i>

330
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:23,650
我的兄弟，我的荣誉，我的家
<i>My brother, my honor, my home...</i>

331
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:30,250
我能想到的是，妈妈眼里深深的失望
<i>All I thought about was 
the disappointment in my mama's eyes.</i>

332
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,250
从那时起我就在逃亡
And I have been running ever since. 

333
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,850
那颗蛋背叛了我
The egg betrayed me.

334
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,750
他的谎言，让我失去一切
His lies cost me everything.

335
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,450
我没睡
I'm awake!

336
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,050
你以为我不想弥补过去吗？
You think I don't want to fix the past?

337
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,150
我下不来
I can't get down.

338
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:11,350
听好，没有一天，我不想我失去的东西
Listen, a day...a day doesn't go by 
when I don't think about what I lost.

339
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,350
我失去了最好的朋友
I lost my best friend ...

340
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,850
我唯一的朋友
my only friend.

341
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,350
而我明白了
我曾变得贪婪、穷凶极恶、让人失望
And I get it now, I got greedy and 
desperate and I let you down.

342
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,450
让自己失望
I let myself down.

343
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,450
我唯一想要的是，猫，再给我一次机会
All I'm asking for, Puss, is a second chance.

344
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:31,650
再给我一次机会
我就能补偿圣里卡多
Give me that second chance 
and I'll help repay you back San Ricardo.

345
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:37,550
求求你，猫，让我向你证明
我们的友情对我有多重要
Please, Puss. Let me show you 
what our friendship mean to me.

346
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:45,250
- 我加入
- 太好了
- I will do it.
- Oh, that's great!

347
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:48,850
我加入，是为了妈妈和圣里卡多
I will do this for my mother 
and for San Ricardo.

348
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,350
不是为了你
Not for you.

349
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:54,050
我们不是搭档，也不是朋友
We are not partners
and we're not friends.

350
00:33:54,950 --> 00:34:00,250
好，我向你保证，不会再让你失望了
Okay and I...I promise this time 
I will not let you down.

351
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:05,150
好！我想我们的魔豆帮重组了
Yes! I think we got our bean club back!

352
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:30,650
- 希望计划能成功
- 听好，你只需要关心你的任务
- This plan better work.
- Listen, you just need to worry about your part. .

353
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,450
别砸锅了
Don't screw it up!

354
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,150
- 怎么？
- 又要戴面具？
- What?
- Again with the mask?

355
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:38,550
我才不用尘灰靴先生给我造型意见
I don't need style advice from Mr. Dusty Boots.

356
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,450
加油，猫，快！
Come on, Puss! Now!

357
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,950
我们的年级也不小了，亲爱的
Our biological clocks are tickin', darlin'.

358
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,750
我们该为未来着想了
You gotta start lookin' at the big picture.

359
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,250
你怎么搞的？！
What's the problem?

360
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:01,250
听好，我一直都有努力保养
Listen, I put a lot of work into my body.

361
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:04,550
我看起来很好
而我也不会让这些努力付诸东流
I look good and I am not 
just gonna throw it away.

362
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,750
- 怎么？
- 看！
- What?
- Look!

363
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,550
太完美了
Excellent!

364
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,750
我才没有时间在家里洗尿片和袜子
I have no time to be at home
with no diapers and veggie stocks.

365
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,850
你大可不必，我可以作住家爸爸
You don't have to, Jill.
I will be the stay at home dad.

366
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,450
我们后面就有10只饥饿的小猪
We have 10 hungry piggies there on the back.

367
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:31,450
你可以先用他们练习
就停车然后喂饱他们
You can practice on them.
Just pull over, feed them!

368
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,750
动作快一些
You've got to hurry!

369
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:39,750
- 怎么不用你的爪子？
- 能给我闭嘴吗？我在弄了
- Why are you not using your claws?
- Would you please just shut up? I'm on it!

370
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,150
- 快用你的爪子！
- 给我安静！
- Just use your claws!
- Be quiet!

371
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:45,150
- 你的爪子！
- 我没有爪子，好没？
- Your claws!
- I don't have any claws, right?

372
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,750
好了好了~小猪乖~快睡觉哈~
是小猪在叫吗？
Was that 'em hog?
There, there, sleepy sleepy big fat piggy...

373
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,850
照顾小猪
You babysit.

374
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,050
柔爪
Soft paws.

375
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,250
好没？
Well ...

376
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:14,250
你好，传说中的豆子
Hello beans of legend!

377
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,050
我们走
Let's go!

378
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:28,550
看看谁来了，吉尔
Look at what we have here, Jill.

379
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:35,050
- 你敢动我们的宝宝
- 你还偷了我的魔豆
- You mess with our baby!
- And you took my beans!

380
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,850
猪肉炸弹来了！
Soft paws bomb!

381
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:47,350
你们会付出代价！坏猫！
You'll gonna pay for this, cat!

382
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,150
给蛋发信号
Signal the egg!

383
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,150
好！
Yes!

384
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,550
- 好了
- 准备
- Okay!
- Ready?

385
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,550
- 预备
- 跳！
Set ... Go!

386
00:37:36,584 --> 00:37:39,003
好吧，让我们看看呗
Well let's find out!

387
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:40,150
好了，小猫，给我豆子吧
Alright, cat! Give me them beans!

388
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:44,650
猫真的总是用脚着地吗？
Is it true, a cat always lands on its feet?

389
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:47,250
不！那只是狗散播的谣言！
No! That is just a rumor spread by dogs!

390
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,050
我说过不会让你失望吧
See I told you I won't let you down!

391
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,250
你以为就这样完了？
You think this is over?

392
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,750
差点打中我了！
Hey, that was close!

393
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:20,850
现在！
Now!

394
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,550
我们一定要撑到桥边
We just gonna make it to that bridge!

395
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,250
坐好了！
Hang on!

396
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:31,450
- 矮蛋，那里没有桥！
- 相信我
Humpty, There is no bridge!
- Trust me.

397
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,850
矮蛋！
Humpty!

398
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,050
我们死定啦！
We're going to die!

399
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:01,950
- 我恨猫
- 我们没完！
- I hate cats.
- This is war!

400
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:14,650
巨人的城堡，我们来了
Giants Castle, here we come!

401
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:21,150
我得把魔豆交给矮蛋，这是团队的成果
i must hand it to the egg.
This was a team effort.

402
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,650
魔豆帮连爪才能做到
Humpty's team had its claws ...

403
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:25,150
我是说连手，我想说的不是…
I mean flaws...
What i meant was...

404
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,750
不是爪子，他也不是猫
Not claws, he's not a cat.

405
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,950
我没觉得这样有什么问题
Not to say there is anything wrong ...

406
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,350
- 我不想谈这个
- 明白
- I don't want to talk about it!
- Got it.

407
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,550
好了，我们就要到了
Okay, We should be close.

408
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:39,550
留意所有运动不寻常的云
Keep your eyes up for 
any strange cloud activity.

409
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,650
我被称之为咪・柔爪
I am called Kitty Softpaws 

410
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:45,150
是因为我能偷走你的东西
而你却完全没有察觉
because I'll steal you blind 
and you'll never even know I was there.

411
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,150
咪
Kitty,

412
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,850
你和他们说的不一样
you're not as good as they say.

413
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,150
比传说更好
You're better!

414
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,650
我会尊重你的隐私
I will respect your privacy.

415
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:12,350
好吧，和你说吧
All right. I'll tell you.

416
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:18,050
那时我只是流浪猫，我有很美的爪子
I was just a stray, but I had beautiful claws.

417
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:23,450
有天，一对善良的夫妇收养了我
One day a really nice couple took me in, 

418
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:27,450
每天早上给我牛奶喝，爱着我
gave me milk every morning, loved me.

419
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:33,950
或许是我玩地毯玩太过了
或者对仓鼠太不友善
Maybe I scratched her curtains 
or play too rough with the hamster.

420
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:39,550
我不知道他们为什么这样，他们拔了我的爪子
I don't know why they did it, 
but they took my claws.

421
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,750
爱猫的人都是疯子
Cat people are crazy.

422
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,850
停车！快停车！我想我们到了
Stop! Stop the cart!
I think this is it!

423
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:12,150
你能相信吗，猫？这么多年之后
Can you believe it, Puss?
After all this years...

424
00:41:11,932 --> 00:41:14,351
这块云的确奇怪
That is a strange cloud.

425
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:17,050
来，我想让你来种
Here! I want you to plant them.

426
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:31,550
好，就是它了，这都是真的！
快来！
Okay, this is it! It's happening! Hurry!

427
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,150
这边来
This way!

428
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:38,050
走快点
Come on!

429
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:42,750
23…云…
停！就这里！
Right Here!

430
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:47,450
现在，种下豆子
Now, place the beans.

431
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,550
请小心地种下豆子
不要叠在一起
Place beans carefully please
not on top of each other!

432
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,450
这些魔法很娇弱
Magic is very delicate.

433
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:58,650
好了，非常好
现在，我们后退
Ok, good! Very good.
Now, just stand back.

434
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,250
这是怎么回事？
What's happening here?

435
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,650
- 是不是魔法在你口袋里走光了？
- 不可能
- Maybe the magic rubbed off in your pocket.
- That's impossible!

436
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,550
好了，好了，不要恐慌
Okay. Okay. Let's not panic.

437
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,850
知道吗，我从书上读过
植物也有感觉的，所以…
You know I read somewhere that plants 
have feelings, so ...

438
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:54,750
去吧，对它说些好话
come on. Say something nice to it.

439
00:42:54,750 --> 00:43:00,250
好了，让我想一想
嗨，小豆芽
Okay. Let me just think for a second.
Hi, little plant!

440
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,850
伙计们
Uh...guys

441
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:25,050
矮蛋
Humpty!

442
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:28,950
- 我看不到他了，你看到没？
- 我也找不到他
- I do not see him. Did you see him?
- I don't see him anywhere.

443
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:31,550
你声音好怪
You sound...weird.

444
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:38,850
因为空气稀薄
快下来，感觉太棒了
It's the thin air!
Come on in, it feels great!

445
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,950
这些云在挠我的鼻子
The cloud, it tickles my nose.

446
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:51,450
那是因为这些水气，天晓得呢
It's because the upper vest.
Who knew?

447
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:59,250
来吧
Come on!

448
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,450
抓到了！
Gotcha!

449
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,750
Meow!

450
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:28,050
猫，觉得如何？我该剃胡子吗？
Hey Puss, what do you think?
Do I shave?

451
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:30,550
来给你看样东西
Let me show you something.

452
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:42,350
这下面某个地方，有两个孩子
不知道是不是孤儿呢
Somewhere down there, there are two little kids.
I don't know, maybe orphans,

453
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:47,150
他们躺在草地上看云，梦想着未来
and they're laying on a hill staring at the clouds 
dreaming about the future.

454
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:50,150
就是我和你，猫
That was me and you, Puss.

455
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:53,350
我和你
Me and you.

456
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:58,850
小子们，你们应该看看这个
Boys, you might wanna take a look at this.

457
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:05,250
巨人的城堡
The giants castle!

458
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:11,550
- 好了，该整装了
- 矮蛋！
- Okay, time to suit up.
- Humpty!

459
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:14,350
我会完美地和金蛋混在一起
I'll fit right in with the golden eggs!

460
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:22,650
- 很棒吧？嗯？
- 矮蛋，你没穿内裤
- Brilliant or what, huh?
- Humpty, you're not wearing underwear!

461
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:27,250
怎么？你感到难为情？我没有哦
What? Are you embarrassed? I'm not.

462
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:32,650
猫，还记得别人都笑话魔豆帮吗？
Puss remember when everyone 
was laughing at bean club?

463
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:34,550
现在是谁笑得出来？我们！
And who is laughing now? We are!

464
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:03,450
那就是我们的目标
That is our target.

465
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:07,950
- 我们说话不像人妖了
- 因为这里面的气压正常了
- Hey, you don't sound like an elf anymore.
- It's because the air pressure in here is normal.

466
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:09,350
我们走
Let's go!

467
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:15,350
计划是这样：你们去拿走金蛋
So here is the plan:
You two get the golden eggs

468
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:18,350
- 我去找巨人单挑
- 没有巨人和你单挑
- I will fight the giant.
- There's no giant to fight.

469
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:19,970
- 巨人死了好几年了
- 啥？
- The giant's been dead for years.
- What? You didn't do the reading, did you? Oh, boy! 

470
00:47:19,971 --> 00:47:21,812
你不怎么读书，对吧，小子？

471
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:23,350
《杰克与魔豆》
Jack and the Beanstalk.

472
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:25,350
第14章里，巨人永远长眠了
Chapter 14,
Giant takes a big dirt nap.

473
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:27,650
脚跟疼
Ah, ankle burn!

474
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:33,350
- 那是什么？
- 这就是他们说的“恐怖”
- What was that?
- They call it The Great Terror.

475
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,950
守护黄金之鹅的那只怪物
It's the monster that guards the golden goose.

476
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:38,650
传说中提到过
当你直视它，你就会变成石头
Legend has it that if you look at it, 
you'll turn to stone.

477
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:42,050
没有人能证实
是因为没人能活着逃脱它
But nobody really knows,
because nobody's walked away from it alive.

478
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:44,250
跟着我，别作声
Follow me and keep quite.

479
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:56,850
- 嘘！矮蛋！
- 我忍不住啊
- Shh! Humpty!
- I can't...I can't help it!

480
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:00,550
我全身都粘粘痒痒的，我得用爽身粉
Everything's rubbing and pinching!
I need powder!

481
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:19,050
我们要怎么过去？
How are we gonna got across?

482
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:20,650
开香槟
Champagne!

483
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:25,250
干杯！
Cheers!

484
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,650
别害怕哦，我会保护你
Do not worry! I will protect you!

485
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:44,950
你要怎么做？用吉他敲它的头？
What you gonna do?
Hit it in the head with a guitar?

486
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:48,850
拜托，别再提吉他的事了
Please, stop bringing up the guitar.

487
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:07,950
接住我！
Catch me!

488
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:12,150
快！
Hurry!

489
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,650
躲！
Hide!

490
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:17,050
别看它！
Don't look at it!

491
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:24,450
闭嘴！
Be quiet!

492
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,850
你得振作起来
You got to get it together!

493
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:34,250
- 加油！
- 好了
- Come on!
- Okay.

494
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:52,750
看看啊！就像蛋蛋天堂
Look at this! It's egg paradise!

495
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:56,950
这儿太美了，我觉得我就属于这里
Oh, it's so beautiful. I feel like I belong here!

496
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:04,350
金蛋！
Golden Eggs!

497
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:08,250
这里能孵出很多小鸡哦
It'll be a lot of chicken!

498
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:12,950
我还以为它们和鸡蛋一样大
I thought they were going to be like chicken size!

499
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:17,450
你能想象它怎么下金蛋的吗？
矮油~
Can you imagine laying one of this? 
Ouch!

500
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,150
猫！
Puss!

501
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:24,350
- 我们要怎么把蛋弄出去？
- 我也不知道
- How do you suppose to get these out of here?
- I do not know!

502
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:29,350
我的天啊
Oh my!

503
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:35,350
黄金之鹅
The Golden Goose!

504
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:38,350
看看她啊
Just look at her!

505
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:39,950
她不美吗？
Isn't she beautiful?

506
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,650
我亲爱的宝贝
My sweet darling!

507
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,550
我觉得她喜欢你
I think she likes you!

508
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:00,750
我们就带走她吧
Let's just take her.

509
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:04,750
等等，这可是传说中的鹅啊
我们不知道带走她会有什么后果
Wait a minute! That's the goose of legend.
We do not know what happens if we take her.

510
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:07,350
我知道不带走她会有什么后果
I know what happen
if we don't take her.

511
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:08,950
我们啥也没捞着
We got nothing!

512
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:13,550
大家伙，她能下金子啊，我们要带走她
Guys! Guys! It's a gold pooper!
We're taking it!

513
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,250
就快到了
Almost there!

514
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,250
抓稳！
Hang on!

515
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,950
它来了！
It's coming!

516
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,650
跑！
Run!

517
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,550
咪！
Kitty!

518
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,350
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

519
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:44,350
抓稳！
Hang on!

520
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:50,450
给我过来！
Come here you!

521
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,450
抓到了！
Gotcha!

522
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:57,950
她是我的了
She's mine now!

523
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:09,450
你好
Hello!

524
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:17,850
不！飞啊！小鹅，飞啊！
No! Fly little gosling, fly!

525
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:25,150
不不，不是这样计划的啊！
Desn't meant to be this way!

526
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:29,050
- 猫？
- 不是
- Puss?
- No.

527
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,450
我很抱歉
I'm sorry!

528
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:56,150
谢谢，威猛先生
Thanks, Ranger.

529
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:05,250
我们应该砍了那豆芽
We should maybe cut that down.

530
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:13,350
看啊，你终于有了想要的家庭了，杰克
Look at that! You finally got 
that family you wanted, Jack.

531
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:17,250
听到了吗？我想他刚才叫我“爸”了
You here that? I think it just called me daddy.

532
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:21,250
- 他看起来很像你，杰克
- 谢谢
- Oh! He looks just like you, Jack.
- Thank you.

533
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:28,684
（矮蛋）

534
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:33,550
那是什么？
Well, what is it?

535
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:46,450
我相信这是给我们的信号
I do believe that's our cue.

536
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:53,750
为了报答圣里卡多！
To paying back San Ricardo!

537
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,650
为了富有
To being rich!

538
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:12,450
你！
You!

539
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:13,950
我？
Me?

540
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,950
嗯嗯，宝贝
Yeah, yeah, baby!

541
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:19,950
1，2，恰恰恰
One, two, cha-cha-cha!

542
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,150
3，4，恰恰恰，1，2
Three, four, cha-cha-cha!
One, two ...

543
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:24,450
什么？
What?

544
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:28,065
我只有一个字对你说，咪・柔爪
There is one word for you, Kitty Softpaws. 
Me-wow!

545
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:35,050
我知道你很有女人缘，超级猛猫先生
I know you have quite a reputation with the ladies, 
Mr. Frisky Two Times.

546
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:38,150
我同时也被称为，毛毛爱人
I've also been knowns as The Fury Lover! 

547
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:42,350
但那都是认识你之前的事了
But that was before I met you.

548
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:46,250
但你不认识我，猫，我不是你想象中的那样
You don't know me, Puss.
I'm not who you think I am.

549
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:47,950
我爱胜利不爱赢取
I'm all about the score.

550
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:52,850
来吧，看着我的眼睛
告诉我你只在乎那些金子？
Come on! Look me in the eyes 
and tell me all you care about is the gold?

551
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,850
- 猫
- 咪
- Puss ...
- Kitty ...

552
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:58,850
额滴神啊
Oh my God!

553
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:02,350
交换舞伴
New partners!

554
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:05,050
不要被他的公猫魅力迷惑
Do not fall for his animal magnetism! 

555
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,950
要专注
Stay focused!

556
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:09,250
什么？
What?

557
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:20,850
我一直在想，柔爪小姐
So, I have been thinking, Miss Softpaws,

558
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:22,350
如果我们要分开走的话
that when we go our separate ways 

559
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:26,550
那我们就能一起分开走了
we can go our separate ways together.

560
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:30,650
猫，你必须要走了
Puss, you have to go now!

561
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:34,350
你不必再抗拒我了，请相信我
You do not have to push me away anymore.
You can trust me.

562
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:35,250
但是…
But ...

563
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:40,450
为圣里卡多的传奇喝彩吧
矮蛋和猫，我们成功了
Give it up for the legend of San Ricardo!
Humpty and Puss, we did it!

564
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:45,250
- 我先去睡了，大家伙
- 咪，一起庆祝吧
- I'm calling it a night, guys.
- Kitty, stay up with us

565
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:49,450
不了，我感觉…要吐毛球了
No, I feel a... hairball coming on.

566
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:52,450
好吧，吐得开心点
Okay, yeah! Have fun with that!

567
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:55,050
我们该给她一点私人空间
We should give her some privacy.

568
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,450
我从没想到我们能走到这一步
I never thought we would get here,

569
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:06,450
在经历过这些事之后
能把它们都抛诸脑后
after all we went through. 
To pull this off together.

570
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:11,150
和好兄弟重聚的感觉真好
It is good to have my brother back.

571
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:14,085
是啊，的确是
Yep, it sure is. Well, we have a big day tomorrow. 
Really exciting stuff.

572
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,685
明天可有好戏上演

573
00:57:18,192 --> 00:57:19,898
多让人兴奋啊

574
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:22,350
我们该休息了
We should get some rest.

575
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:25,750
晚安，矮蛋
Good night, Humpty!

576
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:33,850
你也晚安
Que nesta!

577
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:08,050
我还没死
I'm still alive!

578
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:14,950
杰克和吉尔
Jack and Jill!

579
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:17,050
咪！
Kitty!

580
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:19,350
矮蛋？
Humpty?

581
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:23,850
我会找到你们的
I will find you!

582
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:29,250
快给我滚！
Get out of here!

583
00:58:53,094 --> 00:58:55,271
（圣里卡多）

584
00:59:01,032 --> 00:59:03,209
（通缉：穿靴子的猫
赏钱500）

585
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:24,750
滚开
Be gone!

586
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:29,350
你想要什么？金子吗？我有金子啊
What do you...what do you want? 
Gold? I have gold!

587
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:32,650
杰克，蛋蛋想收买我们呢
Jack, egg's tryin' to bribe us.

588
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:36,850
- 用我们的金子吗？
- 好了，我们只想吃早餐而已
- Hah, with our own gold.
- Come on now. All we want is a little breakfast.

589
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:39,650
- 不要！求求你！
- 你喜欢你的蛋吗，矮蛋？
- No! No! No! Please!
- How do you like your eggs, pumpkin?

590
00:59:39,850 --> 00:59:41,850
不！矮蛋！
Humpty! No!

591
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:51,250
- 好啊，猫
- 惊喜哦！
- Hello, Puss!
- Surprise!

592
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:55,250
这怎么回事？
What is going on?

593
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:59,450
这是个惊喜派对啊，而惊喜是给你的
It's a surprise party and the surprise 
is on you!

594
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:02,350
看起来猫猫刚起床呢
Looks like cat's out of the bag.

595
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:06,050
- 你们是一伙的？
- 是啊，他们都为我卖命
- You were in cahoots?
- Oh, yeah! They all work for me.

596
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:13,650
我在监狱里为了今天准备了很久
I spend a lot of time in the prison 
preparing for this.

597
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:16,450
- 你算计我
- 对啊，我算计你了
- You set me up?
- Oh, yeah! Set you up? Of course! 

598
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:18,450
你以为这就是拿回金子…
You think this was all about getting the gold 

599
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:20,250
然后挽回你的名声？
and clearing your name? 

600
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:25,850
这次的冒险只有一个目的
This little adventure was about one thing.

601
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:28,550
复仇！
Revenge!

602
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:34,450
你根本不知道，猫，我一直在你身边
You never knew it, Puss. But I was always there.

603
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:57,750
你想要补偿过去的过失吗，猫？
You wanted to repay and old debt, Puss? 

604
01:00:57,850 --> 01:00:59,450
我也想
Well so did I.

605
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:00,550
那你为什么这么做？
Why would you do this?

606
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:04,350
你把我抛弃在了桥上！
你在我最需要你的时候抛弃了我
You left me on that bridge! You abandoned me 
when I needed you the most!

607
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:07,050
- 你忘了“永是兄弟”了？
- 你欺骗了我！
- What happened to brothers forever?
- I trusted you!

608
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:08,250
那你终于明白我的感受了
Well now you're finally gonna know 
what it feels like.

609
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:12,250
就是，当你信赖一个人，他却在你背后插刀
You know? To trust someone 
and have them stab you in the back!

610
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:13,950
卫兵！
Guards!

611
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:19,250
穿靴子的猫
你因打劫圣里卡多银行的罪名而被捕
Puss in Boots, you are under arrest 
for the robbery of the San Ricardo bank.

612
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:21,450
把这当成魔豆帮的最后一次聚头吧
Consider this the final meeting of bean club.

613
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:23,650
我应该把你煎了拌着洋葱吃！
I should scramble you with onions!

614
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:26,850
你不应该回来这里
You should never have come back!

615
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:31,350
我的孩子，等等
Pequeno! Wait!

616
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:36,650
- 别和他们打，求你了
- 妈妈，听我说，我能解释
- Do not fight them, please.
- Mom, listen to me! I can explain.

617
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:40,850
不，猫，别再逃跑了
No! Puss, not more running!

618
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:45,650
请不要再让我伤心了
面对你做过的一切吧
Please stop breaking my heart
and face what you have done.

619
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:53,250
对不起，妈妈，我让你失望了
I'm sorry, Mama. I let you down.

620
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:58,550
把爪子举起来
Paws where we can see them!

621
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:01,350
转过身，慢慢地
Turn around... slow!

622
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:05,250
再慢！
Guard!

623
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:15,150
走进笼子里，走得安静漂亮些
Step into the carrier! Quietlike!

624
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:26,250
注意了！注意了！
请大家尽量走近一些
Attention, attention everyone, 
If you could move a little closer!

625
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:32,350
女士们先生们
我为您呈现――传说中的黄金之鹅
Ladies and gentlemen, I present
legendary the golden goose of legend!

626
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:39,650
咪，不要是你啊
Kitty? Not you too.

627
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:47,050
大家都有金子！
Gold for everyone!

628
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:52,250
我们有新鲜热辣的金子啦！乡亲们！
We got some fresh hot gold here,
folks!

629
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:56,150
都来拿啊！要趁热啊！
Step right up!
Get it hot!

630
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:13,550
帽子一顶，腰带一条
还有一双鞋
One hat. One belt. And two boots...

631
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:16,450
曾经，荣耀的象征
... Once a symbol of honor.

632
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:20,650
还有一瓶蒙汗药！
One bottle of catnap...

633
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:23,550
给我的青光眼用的
Uh...it is for my glaucoma.

634
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:30,550
这就是你该呆的地方，法外之徒
This is where you belong, outlaw!

635
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:35,350
这就是你度过下半辈子的地方
And this is where you will stay forever.

636
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:56,050
别因为我停下来哦
Don't stop on my account.

637
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:12,250
看来那颗蛋得到了他想要的东西
It looks like the egg got what he wanted.

638
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:15,550
- 你是在说矮蛋吗？
- 别提他的名字
- You talking about Humpty?
- Ublee..ublee...umm! Don't say his name!

639
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:19,150
以前那坏蛋和我一起在这个牢房里
I used to share this cell 
with that smelly thing.

640
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:22,450
他离开那天是我人生最快乐的日子
Happiest day of my life was when he left.

641
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:25,350
直到我发现他偷走了我的魔豆
till I realized he stole my magic beans.

642
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:28,650
等等等等，你曾拥有魔豆？你是谁？
Wait! Wait! Wait! You had the beans? 
Who are you?

643
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:32,150
你叫什么名字？
Hey! What's your name?

644
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:35,850
安迪・豆茎，朋友们都叫我杰克
Uuh! Andy Beanstalk,
my parents call me Jack.

645
01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:39,950
我用家里的牛换了那些魔豆
I traded the family cow for them beans.

646
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:43,450
当然，那不是我家的牛，是人家家里的牛
Of course it wasn't my family's cow, 
some others family's family cow.

647
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:45,150
所以我被判了8到10年
That's why I got eight to ten year.

648
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:49,050
一定要认清楚自己的牛啊
Always know which cow's you're...

649
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:54,550
老疯子，醒醒！你还知道什么？
Crazy man! Wake up!
What else do you know?

650
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:58,450
我们都完了，多亏了那坏蛋
We're all goners! Thanks to that little stinky.

651
01:04:58,550 --> 01:05:03,650
我说过，我说过不要带走那只鹅
但他一心只想要报仇
I told him! I told him not to take the goose, 
but all he wanted was his revenge.

652
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,850
别带走鹅，为什么？
Don't take the goose. Why?

653
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:13,950
那个“恐怖”，是黄金之鹅的妈妈
The Great Terror! That's the golden goose's mom.

654
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:15,150
噢，不
Oh, no.

655
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:21,350
当她回来找寻孩子的时候，就会带来血雨腥风
And she will be out for blood 
when she comes back for her baby!

656
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:25,050
守卫！圣里卡多灾难临头啦！
Guard! San Ricardo is
in terrible danger!

657
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:27,850
- 你一定要听我说！
- 闭嘴！
- You must listen to me!
- Quiet you!

658
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:53,450
闭嘴！
Shut up!

659
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:13,650
把门打开
Open the door ...

660
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:22,250
放下武器
Drop the weapon!

661
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:25,350
非常好
Very good!

662
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:27,550
站一边去
Step aside!

663
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:31,350
不！恶魔之猫！
No! Diablo gato!

664
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:34,350
有一套嘛
Nice try!

665
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:48,850
希望你能原谅我
I hope you can forgive me.

666
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:51,350
道歉接受！
Apology accepted!

667
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:54,150
我才没有时间理你
I don't really have time for you.

668
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:56,950
我要保护镇子不被“恐怖”毁了
I have to save the town from The Great Terror.

669
01:06:57,050 --> 01:07:00,950
等等，猫
你不明白吗？我来这里是因为…
Wait, Puss!
Don't you see, I'm here because...

670
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:04,350
我来这里是因为你让我明白
I am here because you made me realize 

671
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:08,650
我心里有比金子还重要的东西
that there is something I can care about more than gold.

672
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:13,750
- 东西？
- 好啦，某猫
- Some thing?
- Okay, someone.

673
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:16,850
他大概两尺高，穿高跟鞋
He's about two feet tall, wears high heels.

674
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:20,450
- 他帅不？
- 他超级的帅
- Handsome?
- He's very handsome!

675
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:22,450
是只猛猫吗？
A real beefcake?

676
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:23,649
- 骏马？
- 是的
- A stallion? Yes.
- Tiger? Oh, brother ...

677
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:25,541
- 猛虎？
- 大哥…

678
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:29,550
但是，这并不代表我们扯平了
But, this does not make us even.

679
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:30,950
别动！
Freeze!

680
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:34,650
- 不，扯平了
- 不，没扯平
- Yes it does!
- No, it doesn't!

681
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:42,650
我救过你，你欠我一次
I saved you!
You owed me one.

682
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:45,350
你没告诉我矮蛋的计划
You didn't tell me about Humpty.

683
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:49,350
所以你欠我两次了
So now you owe me two.

684
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:56,650
- 你真是难对付
- 对啊，但我值得嘛
- Oh, you are a lot of work.
- I know, but I am worth it!

685
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:03,350
你跑不掉的，穿靴子的猫！
You are not getting away, Puss in boots!

686
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:05,650
想要靴子吗？
Oh boots!

687
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:09,450
- 咪！
- 现在扯平了
- Kitty!
- Now we're even!

688
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:20,250
这里是圣里卡多的天气预报
This is your San Ricardo weather report.

689
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:22,950
一只巨鹅毁掉这镇子的几率是
The chances of giant goose
destroying the town ...

690
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:25,150
100%
... 100%.

691
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:32,450
“永不落单，团结一致”
<i>never alone. Always together.</i>

692
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:36,350
“矮蛋和猫，永是兄弟”
<i>- Humpty and Puss ...
- Brother forever</i>

693
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:42,850
来吧，宝贝，在妈妈来之前离开这里吧
Come on, sweetie. Let's get out of here
come before Momma shows up.

694
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:47,050
我该煎了你做鸡蛋沙拉三明治！
I shall make you into an egg salad sandwich!

695
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:49,450
这太恶心了！
Aah! That is disgusting!

696
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:53,250
- 给我金鹅，矮蛋
- 这恐怖做不到
- Give me the goose, Humpty!
- No can do, I'm afraid.

697
01:08:53,350 --> 01:08:55,250
她妈妈就要来了
而当她来了之后…
See the mama's on her way and when she gets here,

698
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:59,550
圣里卡多和你在乎的一切都要拜拜了
it's bye bye San Ricardo and everything 
you ever cared about.

699
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:02,950
对我复仇是一回事，那伊梅尔达呢？
Revenge on me is one thing;
but why Imelda?

700
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:05,750
孤儿院呢？那是我们的家啊
Why the orphanage?
This is our home!

701
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,550
你是说你家
You mean your home!

702
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:11,850
我根本不属于这里
I...I never belonged here.

703
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:13,450
我们本来计划好逃走的
We had a plan to get out of here,

704
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:17,150
但突然间英雄出现了
然后选择了这里而抛弃了我
but then you became a hero 
and you picked this place over me.

705
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:21,250
你带走了我的一切
You left me with nothing!

706
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:29,250
矮蛋，很抱歉我伤害了你
Humpty, I'm sorry I hurt you.

707
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:35,250
但不要牵连这里的人，你不是这样的人
But do not take it out on these people.
You are better than this.

708
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:37,950
不，我是的
No, I'm not.

709
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:40,350
拜托，我认识真正的矮蛋
Oh, come on! I know the real Humpty.

710
01:09:40,450 --> 01:09:44,950
那不平凡的眼光，那位发明家，那位梦想家
The way you saw the world, 
the inventor, the dreamer.

711
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:47,650
那个人怎么了？
What happened to that guy?

712
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:55,050
我想已经太晚了
I think it's too late!

713
01:09:55,150 --> 01:09:57,450
做正确的事情永远不晚
It is never too late to do the right thing.

714
01:09:57,550 --> 01:09:59,750
在一起，我们能拯救圣里卡多
Together, we can save San Ricardo.

715
01:10:05,650 --> 01:10:10,050
我这就原谅你，矮蛋，只要你帮我一把
I can forgive you, Humpty, if you help me now.
I'll try!

716
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:14,086
真的？在我对你做过这么多事情之后？
- Really? After everything put you through?
- Prove to me there is still a good egg in you!

717
01:10:14,087 --> 01:10:16,781
这就证明给我看，你有颗闪亮的心

718
01:10:59,150 --> 01:11:01,350
快跑！
Run!

719
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:14,050
眼镜好了
Googles ... check.

720
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:16,750
把小鹅带到桥那里
我会把妈妈带过去
Get the baby over the bridge.
I'll get the mother to follow.

721
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:19,550
帮我推…
Give me a puuuu!

722
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:44,850
鹅妈妈！
Mother Goose!

723
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:54,250
等等！跟我走，我能帮你找到宝宝
Wait! Just follow me and 
I'll lead you to your baby!

724
01:11:59,050 --> 01:12:01,550
不！不是那边！
No! Not that way!

725
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:05,850
我的孩子！救命啊！
Pequeno! Help!

726
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:07,350
撑住！
Hang on!

727
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:09,350
抓到你了
I got you!

728
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:18,350
那是我的孩子
That's my boy!

729
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:27,050
跟我来，鹅妈妈，我知道你的宝宝在哪儿
这边！
Come with me, mamam goose!
I know where your baby is! Here!

730
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:44,150
- 矮蛋！快马加鞭！
- 我鞭了！猫！我鞭了！
- Humpty, Pick up the pace!
- I'm trying, Puss! I'm trying!

731
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:52,550
抱歉，蛋头，我们想要的不止金蛋
Sorry, Egghead.
We want more than just egg.

732
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:54,450
把金鹅给我们怎样？
So how about give us that goose?

733
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:55,850
矮蛋
Humpty!

734
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:03,350
- 干的漂亮
- 没有我你能干什么？
- Nice moves!
- What would you do without me?

735
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:09,850
站住！
Freeze!

736
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:16,150
卫队长！我…能解释…
Commandante! I can explain!

737
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:21,850
猫！我一定要把你送回牢房！
我这辈子一定要抓住你！
Gato, you are going back to jail,
if it's the last thing I do!

738
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:23,550
矮蛋，快啊！
Humpty, hurry!

739
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:26,350
我们快到了
We're almost there!

740
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:53,050
- 救命！猫！
- 矮蛋！撑住！
- Puss! Help!
- Humpty! Hang on!

741
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:07,350
又这样了，对吧，猫？
Here we are again. Right, Puss?

742
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:13,150
我这次绝不放手，矮蛋
I will not leave you behind this time, Humpty.

743
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:23,350
对不起，猫
I'm sorry, Puss.

744
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:28,150
我总是做不好事情，我是颗坏蛋
I've made a mess out of everything.
I am a rotten egg!

745
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:35,850
我不是人类，我也不是鸟类
我还不能吃
I'm not...I'm not a person. I'm not a bird,
I'm not even a food.

746
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:39,050
我连自己是什么都不知道
I don't know what I am!

747
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:44,050
你就是，永远都是，我的兄弟
You are what you have always been, my brother!

748
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:49,150
永是兄弟
Brothers forever!

749
01:15:01,650 --> 01:15:05,650
- 你无法同时救我们俩
- 不，我能，撑住就好
- You can't save us both!
- Yes, I can. Just hang on!

750
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:12,250
猫，你必须要救鹅宝宝
不然鹅妈妈会毁了圣里卡多
Puss, you have to save the baby,
or the mama will destroy San Ricardo.

751
01:15:13,950 --> 01:15:16,450
这样做才对
It's the right thing to do.

752
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:22,050
这次我不会放手的，矮蛋
I will not let you go, Humpty!

753
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:26,850
我知道你不会，所以我让你别无选择
I know you won't, so I won't make you choose.

754
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,150
矮蛋
Humpty!

755
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:54,750
我很抱歉，她没事了
I'm very sorry. She's okay!

756
01:16:02,650 --> 01:16:04,950
矮蛋？
Humpty,

757
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:26,550
我就知道你内心闪亮
I always knew that you were good inside.

758
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:43,050
再见，矮蛋
Goodbye, Humpty.

759
01:16:56,650 --> 01:16:58,450
是他，穿靴子的猫
It's him, Puss in boots!

760
01:16:58,650 --> 01:17:02,450
- 他从巨鹅手中解救了我们
- 他的剑犹如闪电
- He saved us from the giant goose!
- His sword is like lightning!

761
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:04,450
他们说他有10条命
They said he has ten lives!

762
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:08,250
他的靴子是用最上乘的皮做的
His boots are made
of the finest leather!

763
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:10,750
他只喝牛奶
He drinks whole milk.

764
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:15,750
好传说
Good legend!

765
01:17:15,850 --> 01:17:19,350
他不是法外之徒，他救了我们
He is no outlaw. He saved us!

766
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:22,150
Meow!

767
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:26,050
给你的礼物，妈妈
A gift for you, Mama.

768
01:17:28,650 --> 01:17:31,950
我要走了，卫兵要来抓我了
I have to go, 
the soldiers are coming for me.

769
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:37,450
我真为你骄傲，孩子
I am so proud of you, my son.

770
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:44,350
今天，你以勇气和荣耀面对过去
Today you faced the past with bravery and honor.

771
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:47,339
你赢得了这双靴
You earned those boots and the people know 
that you are San Ricardo's greatest hero.

772
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:52,284
而人们都知道你是圣里卡多最伟大的英雄

773
01:17:53,850 --> 01:17:56,350
为你而做的，妈妈
I did it for you, Mom.

774
01:17:56,750 --> 01:18:02,950
- 你会一直在我心里
- 你也在我心里
- You will always be in my heart!
- And you in mine.

775
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:06,250
猫！
Gato!

776
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:09,150
在那儿！我看到他了！
