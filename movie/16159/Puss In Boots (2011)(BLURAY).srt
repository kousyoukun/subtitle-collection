1
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:39,673
<i>Through the years,
I have been known by many names.</i>

2
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,384
<i>Diablo Gato.</i>

3
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,990
<i>The Furry Lover.</i>

4
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,389
<i>Chupacabra.</i>

5
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,059
<i>Friskie Two-Times.</i>

6
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,386
<i>And the Ginger Hit Man.</i>

7
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:58,764
<i>But to most... lam Puss In Boots!</i>

8
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,569
<i>Outlaw.</i>

9
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,273
I will never forget you... Margherita.

10
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,768
I mean, Rosa.

11
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,972
Sorry. I think maybe I should go.

12
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,654
You cannot run forever,

13
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,986
Puss In Boots!

14
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:39,334
<i>What can I say? I was a had kitty.</i>

15
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,336
<i>Just a fugitive from the law...
forever running.</i>

16
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,108
<i>Searching for a way
to clear my name.</i>

17
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,018
<i>And I would get that chance...</i>

18
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:01,015
<i>on this one fateful night.</i>

19
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,235
Here, kitty, kitty!

20
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,901
Raoul.

21
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,737
Look what the cat dragged in.

22
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,915
Oh, wait... That is the cat!

23
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,247
One leche, please.

24
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:15,093
- What are you doing here, señor?
Did you lose your ball of yarn?

25
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,295
So funny.

26
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,604
One leche coming up.

27
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,788
I am not looking for trouble.

28
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,796
I am but a humble gato
in search of his next meal.

29
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,433
Perhaps you gentlemen
can help me find a simple score?

30
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:57,466
The only thing you'll find tonight
is trouble... Puss In Boots.

31
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:12,313
Well, perhaps if one of us were to
tell the law that you are in town,

32
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,822
we could split the reward.

33
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,626
You made the cat angry.

34
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,831
You do not want to make the cat angry!

35
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,108
The Church of St. Michael
has just put up a golden statue

36
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,679
of the Virgin of Guadalupe.

37
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,679
I do not steal from churches.

38
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,785
The boys' orphanage has been donated
silver candlesticks,

39
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,545
they would look very lovely
in your home.

40
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,553
I do not steal from orphans.

41
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,692
What about Jack and Jill?

42
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,851
- Shh! Are you crazy?
- The what?

43
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,466
The murderous outlaws Jack and Jill

44
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,627
have gotten their hands on...
magic beans.

45
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:03,239
Do not joke with me about magic beans!

46
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:07,902
I searched half my life for them.
They do not exist.

47
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,241
No, cat. We have seen them.

48
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:15,580
These... are the beans of legend.

49
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:21,523
Grows a vine to the Land of Giants,

50
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,423
and the Golden Goose.

51
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,188
The Golden Goose...

52
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:29,265
A heist like this
could set you up for life.

53
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,265
All nine of them.

54
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,563
Show him the golden eggs.

55
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,103
No!

56
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:38,071
Please, you have shown enough.

57
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:43,112
Only a cat with a death wish would
steal the beans from Jack and Jill.

58
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:49,786
The only wish I have
is to repay an old debt.

59
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,944
And this is my chance.

60
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,456
Now...

61
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,618
where do I find this Jack and Jill?

62
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,626
I'm sorry... we have no rooms.

63
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,233
Well, I think one just opened up.

64
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,680
We'd like a complimentary
continental breakfast.

65
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:54,250
And don't even think about skimpin'
on them baby muffins.

66
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,858
We don't have any baby muffins.

67
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,330
You know, Jill...

68
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,628
I been thinking.

69
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,032
Get it out.

70
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:19,199
I... Once we're done
with this magic bean business

71
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:22,539
and got ourselves
all them beautiful golden eggs...

72
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,041
Go on.

73
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,980
That we cut down on some
of the hijacking and murdering.

74
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,711
I mean, it's fun and all, but...

75
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,116
I want a baby.

76
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,560
A baby what, Jack?

77
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:47,293
A baby us, Jill. We'll raise it wild,
like a squirrel or something.

78
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:51,037
<i>Holy frijoles!</i>

79
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,040
They do exist.

80
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,975
Ever since you fell down that hill
and broke your crown,

81
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,637
you have been talking crazy.

82
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,655
It couldn't hurt to have
an extra shooter during ambushes.

83
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:09,020
Maybe I cut too deep...
cut that brain out of your head.

84
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,920
Hey! What gives?

85
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,224
If it's to be a girl,
she'll have your strong...

86
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,427
No! No! No!

87
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,664
You, you, you! You stop where you are!

88
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:26,571
I don't know, Jack. How do I ride and
shoot with a baby slung on my back?

89
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,111
They got them backpacks now.
The way I see it, Jill...

90
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,114
Those beans are mine!

91
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:36,685
We fall off this flat earth one time.
What better proof of our love...

92
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:37,843
Me?

93
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,725
You snap me?

94
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,461
You snap me?!

95
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,301
You looking for something?

96
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,315
No.

97
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,612
<i>No hablo inglés.</i>

98
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,555
You are going to pay for this!

99
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,328
No!

100
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:58,963
Chupacabra!

101
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,968
Chupacabra! Chupacabra!

102
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,539
- Chupacabra!
- You are a crazy woman!

103
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,588
Those magic beans were my score!

104
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,859
You just cost me a chance at getting
the golden eggs, <i>mi</i> amigo.

105
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,094
Put up your dukes.

106
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,415
Very well.

107
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,380
If it is to be a dance fight,

108
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,919
then I will Tuesday-Night-Dance-Fight
you to the death!

109
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,172
How dare you do the Litter Box at me!

110
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,140
Hello!

111
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,935
Can you feel me?

112
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,934
Fear me... if you dare.

113
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:28,128
You hit me in the head with a guitar?!

114
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,240
You are a woman?

115
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,204
Amateur.

116
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,583
Wow!

117
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,954
<i>Señorita, wait!</i>

118
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:50,992
Let me buy you some leche!
I am a lover, not a fighter.

119
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,257
Hello?

120
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:59,301
You are hiding from me?

121
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,064
I like to play the games, too.

122
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:07,268
I sense in you a kindred spirit, a...

123
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,283
I smell something familiar.

124
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,186
Something... dangerous.

125
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:20,754
Something...

126
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,819
breakfasty.

127
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,260
It's been a long time, brother.

128
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,960
<i>Maldito huevo.</i>

129
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:39,269
Humpty Alexander Dumpty.

130
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,443
How dare you show your face to me.

131
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:47,106
I know you're angry.
You have every right.

132
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,781
But it is good to see you, Puss.

133
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,353
Are those new boots?

134
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:57,119
No! They are the same boots I wore
when you betrayed me.

135
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,691
Betrayed you?

136
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,322
You left me cracked in pieces
on a bridge, surrounded by soldiers!

137
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,729
They wrote a song about it!

138
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,064
And how did we get on that bridge
in the first place?!

139
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,140
Because we were brothers, and brothers
are supposed to look after each other...

140
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,468
Humpty!

141
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,702
Remember why we're here.

142
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,372
I should have known.

143
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,483
I had the magic beans in my grasp,

144
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:27,317
and you sent this very attractive
devil woman to interfere.

145
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,319
You are a curse on my life!

146
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,059
Wait. Hear me out. OK?

147
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,753
Yes, yes,
I sent Kitty to bring you here.

148
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,092
But she is no ordinary thief.

149
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,564
She's Kitty Softpaws.

150
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,898
The softest touch in Spain.

151
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,042
That's a lot of heel for a guy,
don't you think?

152
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,004
Look, with Kitty's skill,
your sword and my brain,

153
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,741
we've got a fighting chance here.

154
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,853
Puss, come on, you of all people
know that nobody's ever ripped off

155
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,546
the giant's castle
and lived to tell the tale.

156
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,952
You want to survive? You need a plan.

157
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:07,530
And I've studied this job my whole life.
You know that.

158
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,791
Let's be honest.

159
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,458
Without me, you don't even know
where to plant the beans, Puss.

160
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,903
But Jack and Jill do.
They're on their way.

161
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:22,302
We go up the beanstalk outlaws,
and we come down legends.

162
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,309
So what do you say?

163
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:28,315
Partners?

164
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,984
No. Never again.

165
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:39,489
I'm sorry, OK?
How long are you gonna hold a grudge?

166
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:43,827
It's been seven years!
That's like 35 cat years.

167
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:47,501
You need me! And I need you.

168
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:53,641
Puss! You got any idea what they do
to eggs in San Ricardo prison?

169
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:00,013
I'll tell you this, my friend.

170
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,016
It ain't over easy.

171
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:10,687
Adiós... Humpty Dumpty.

172
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,866
Oh, this is bad. This is bad.

173
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:23,370
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
I know how to speak meow.

174
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,268
Sad story with your twisted lies

175
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:29,310
in your greasy shell
that smells like old ham!

176
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,675
I should crack you open for...

177
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,550
Look what I found.

178
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,562
Someone forgot his money.

179
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,734
Oh, you are dangerous.

180
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,673
Humpty says you like danger.

181
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,512
Just think of all the trouble
we can get into.

182
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,742
The two of us together.

183
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:13,913
We can steal a lot of golden eggs.

184
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,429
And... you owe me.

185
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:24,932
I owe you?

186
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:28,094
You hit me in the head with a guitar.

187
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,262
I regret the guitar.

188
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,940
OK, I forgive you.

189
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,442
So... you're in?

190
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:41,775
There is one teeny, tiny,
itty-bitty problem.

191
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,613
And what is that?

192
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:46,786
You work for the egg!

193
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:52,120
Come on, Puss. What happened between
you and Humpty that was so bad?

194
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:57,127
I am afraid with me and Humpty...

195
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,429
the scars are too deep.

196
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:07,944
It all started a long time ago.

197
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,910
Oh, no. You really don't have to tell me
your whole life story, please.

198
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,912
You may want to sit.

199
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:18,152
It is at times quite... painful.

200
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,153
OK, here we go.

201
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:24,650
It was a year
in which the rain had not fallen.

202
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:29,155
<i>The wind was big
and the basket was small.</i>

203
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,596
<i>For days, I bounced along...</i>

204
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:35,500
<i>a hungry little kitten
with no milk, no mama,</i>

205
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,504
<i>and no litter box.</i>

206
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:42,169
<i>Until I came to rest at a home
for lost children.</i>

207
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,679
<i>Her name was Imelda.</i>

208
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:57,315
<i>And, like a mother, she took me into
her heart and raised me as her own.</i>

209
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,789
<i>Silencio.</i>

210
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,757
<i>Silencio.</i>

211
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,129
<i>She was an angel of kindness.</i>

212
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,202
<i>, 'Silencio!</i>

213
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:10,470
<i>Most of the time.</i>

214
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:14,202
I'd like to introduce
a new boy joining us.

215
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:18,041
It's OK, pequeño.
You show with the face.

216
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,316
Go on.

217
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:32,161
<i>And that was the moment I met...</i>

218
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,293
Humpty Alexander Dumpty.

219
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:38,866
Hey, Whiskers! You're sitting
in Little Boy Blue's chair.

220
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,497
Oh, come on. Is this necessary?

221
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,662
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?

222
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,638
Who asked you, Breakfast?

223
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:47,299
Remember what Imelda says, Boy Blue:

224
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:50,538
If you're going to blow your top,
you blow your horn instead, right?

225
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,976
Let's spin him.

226
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,378
Please don't spin me. Do not spin me!

227
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,985
Not again! No! I'm going to yolk!

228
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:00,817
<i>Even though he took my beans,
the egg stood up for me,</i>

229
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,754
<i>and I decided then...</i>

230
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,360
<i>that I would always
have his hack.</i>

231
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:13,763
Wow!

232
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,266
That was very impressive. Thanks!

233
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:18,866
Hey, egg boy!

234
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:25,872
<i>There was something about this
strange little egg that intrigued me.</i>

235
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:46,266
Oh... it's you.
I've been collecting for months now.

236
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,905
You never know when you're gonna
get lucky. You know what I mean?

237
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,304
Magic beans... is what they are.

238
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,935
Hello?

239
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,914
You gonna tell all the other kids
that I believe in magic now?

240
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,879
Is that what you're gonna do?

241
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,478
No? What's your name?

242
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,654
You don't say much, do you?

243
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,259
I think I'll call you Sparky.

244
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:12,590
Whiskers?

245
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:13,988
Zoltar!

246
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,432
How about Puss?

247
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,633
<i>Humpty's mind
was full of imagination and invention.</i>

248
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,432
What is that, 50 feet down there?

249
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:27,133
Here we go. Give me a...

250
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,006
Puss!

251
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,743
Look at me, Puss! I'm flying!

252
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:40,348
<i>He spoke of legends and adventures
beyond my wildest dreams.</i>

253
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:43,925
When I find those magic beans,
they'll grow a vine

254
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,153
straight up into the clouds,

255
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:50,664
where a terrible and a fearsome giant
hoards his greatest treasure...

256
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,328
the Golden Goose.

257
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,802
Oh, the Golden Goose. Just one.

258
00:24:55,961 --> 00:25:00,603
Just one of her golden eggs...
could set me for life.

259
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,275
It's my destiny, Puss.

260
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:08,441
I can't really explain it,
but I just feel like I belong up there.

261
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,622
Oh, boy. This is awkward.

262
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,784
This is kind of a solo dream here.

263
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,792
I don't need any dead weight,
you know, holding me down.

264
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,900
What are you doing?

265
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:31,572
Oh, man, that's good. The eye thing that
you're doing, that is really splendid.

266
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,644
OK, let me just think for a second.
All right... OK.

267
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,211
This is crazy, but...

268
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,544
I am considering a partnership.

269
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,051
I just need to know one thing.

270
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,422
Can you commit?

271
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,825
<i>Si... I can commit.</i>

272
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:53,394
Oh, you can talk!
Could you help me up?

273
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:56,988
OK...

274
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,168
First rule of Bean Club...

275
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,504
you do not talk about Bean Club.

276
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,736
Second rule of Bean Club...

277
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,941
is you don't talk about Bean Club.
You ready?

278
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,206
Ready.

279
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:15,718
From this day forth,
it shall be known...

280
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:19,048
Never alone, always together...

281
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,553
Humpty and Puss...

282
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,349
Brothers forever.

283
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,789
<i>And from that moment on,</i>

284
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,126
<i>we were united on a great adventure
to find the magic beans.</i>

285
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:30,391
Help me up.

286
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,060
Egg me.

287
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:34,303
<i>Humpty was the brains...</i>

288
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:36,939
- Good gracious!
- I never saw him!

289
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:39,631
<i>- That really hurt!
- ...and I was the skill.</i>

290
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:42,135
I'm cracked!

291
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:49,079
We got red beans, green beans, coffee
beans, lima beans... but no magic beans.

292
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,148
Would you care for a jelly bean?

293
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,482
Thank you.

294
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,491
<i>Finding them meant everything to us.</i>

295
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,656
I almost forgot
the most important thing.

296
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:01,924
That's me and you, Puss.

297
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:04,923
Me and you.

298
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,593
<i>But we never did find them.</i>

299
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,002
<i>And, as years passed,
the quest for magic beans</i>

300
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:15,440
seemed more and more
like the dreams of <i>a</i> child.

301
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:20,510
<i>As teenagers,
Humpty and I looked for trouble...</i>

302
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,849
<i>and often found it.</i>

303
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:27,184
Third time this month, Imelda.
Next time is jail time.

304
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,586
They're just kids.

305
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:32,354
They are thieves.

306
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:39,200
You are better than this.

307
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,531
I believe in you with all my heart.

308
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:45,470
Please do not let me down.

309
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:50,810
I hate this place.
I cannot wait for us to get out of here.

310
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,611
Throw a rock.
It'll make you feel better.

311
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:58,647
Oh, boy. We should go.

312
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,717
<i>On instinct, I reacted.</i>

313
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,701
He saved the Comandante's mother!

314
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:21,204
He saved the Comandante's mother!

315
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,678
You saved my mother.

316
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:33,414
Señor Puss... he is a hero!

317
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:41,087
Today we see that courage and bravery
come in all sizes!

318
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:45,834
<i>Little did I know that one moment
would change my whole life.</i>

319
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,561
These are for you, my boy.

320
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:53,607
Wear them as a symbol of honor...
and justice.

321
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:57,542
I will make you proud, Mama.

322
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:02,742
You already have, my Puss In Boots.

323
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:08,286
<i>How strange it was
to give a cat boots...</i>

324
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:11,620
<i>but, whoa... I looked good!</i>

325
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:14,627
<i>And as the light of my path
grew brighter...</i>

326
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:19,128
<i>Humpty% road grew ever darker.</i>

327
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:27,304
Gracias, Comandante.

328
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,911
Be careful of the company you keep.

329
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,074
I know! I know, I never should've
tried something without you.

330
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,744
You're not stealing lollipops any more,
Humpty. This is getting serious.

331
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,288
You're right!
We have to be smarter about this.

332
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,653
Here, look. We need to think bigger.

333
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,591
I've been casing the silversmith
and it's perfect.

334
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:49,231
You and me, in and out,
50 seconds tops.

335
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,993
Will you put that away!
This is our home.

336
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,797
These people have done nothing to us.

337
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,429
Our home? OK, yeah, I get it now.

338
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:02,009
You get some fancy boots
and now you're too good for me?

339
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,578
That is not true.

340
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,806
We weren't born here.
We're orphans!

341
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,779
All we got is each other,
you understand?

342
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,577
We are better than this.

343
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,477
But we're partners.

344
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,681
We are brothers.

345
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,160
But I am not stealing any more.

346
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:23,461
<i>But Humpty would not
give up so easily.</i>

347
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,296
I'm in trouble, Puss!

348
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,663
It's Boy Blue and his gang.
I owe them some money.

349
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,033
They're coming for me.
Just get me over this wall.

350
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:33,673
I gotta go. Help me up the wall.
Get me up the wall. Hurry! Hurry!

351
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,987
OK, I've got everything. We did it.
Come on, let's go!

352
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:49,648
How could you do this to me?!

353
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:52,294
I did you a favor!
We can finally get out of here!

354
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,158
This is the money of the people!
This is all they have!

355
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,670
You disgrace those boots!

356
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:03,703
Comandante, please, I can explain!

357
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,068
Arrest them!

358
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,373
Hurry up! Get to the bridge!

359
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:15,712
- You tricked me!
- I had to! You left me no choice!

360
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,752
Mama...

361
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,759
Pequeño.

362
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:28,686
Watch out!

363
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,447
Oh, no.

364
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:48,606
Puss. I can't get up.

365
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:51,014
Puss! Help me. I can't get up!

366
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,518
Freeze!

367
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,087
Puss, save me!

368
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,225
Save yourself.

369
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,588
We got you.

370
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:18,207
<i>I lost everything
I cared about that day.</i>

371
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,046
<i>My brother.</i>

372
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:22,707
<i>My</i> honor.

373
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,217
<i>My home.</i>

374
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:30,451
<i>All I thought about was the
disappointment in my mama's eyes.</i>

375
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,386
And I have been running ever since.

376
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:40,900
The egg betrayed me.

377
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,733
His lies cost me everything.

378
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,741
- Hey!
- I'm awake!

379
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:52,006
You think I don't want to fix the past?

380
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,110
I can't get down.

381
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:10,031
Listen. A day... A day doesn't go by

382
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,327
when I don't think about what I lost.

383
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:17,028
I lost my best friend.

384
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,471
My only friend.

385
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,611
And I get it now. I got greedy
and desperate and I let you down.

386
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,804
I let myself down.

387
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:27,472
All I'm asking for, Puss,
is a second chance.

388
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:31,848
Give me that second chance
and I'll help you pay back San Ricardo.

389
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,788
Please, Puss.

390
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:37,722
Let me show you
what our friendship meant to me.

391
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:45,295
- I will do it.
- That's great.

392
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:50,667
I will do this for my mother
and for San Ricardo... not for you.

393
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:54,332
We are not partners
and we are not friends.

394
00:33:55,166 --> 00:34:00,013
OK. I promise this time,
I will not let you down.

395
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,344
Yes!

396
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:05,850
I think we got our Bean Club back.

397
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:27,575
Humpty's plan better work.

398
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:32,738
Listen, you just need to worry about
your part. Don't screw it up.

399
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,248
- What?
- Again with the mask?

400
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:39,013
I don't need style advice
from Mr. Dusty Boots.

401
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,360
Come on, Puss. Now!

402
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:55,229
Our biological clocks
are tickin', darlin'.

403
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,067
- You gotta look at the big picture.
- What's your problem?

404
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,471
Listen.
I put a lot of work into my body.

405
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:04,613
I look good, and I am not
just gonna throw that away.

406
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:09,651
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

407
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:11,286
- We're gonna start small.
- Look.

408
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,422
Let's just pretend you have a baby.

409
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,422
Excellent.

410
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:23,157
I don't have time to be at home
with no diapers and baby socks.

411
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,995
You don't have to, Jill.
I'll be the stay-at-home dad.

412
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:28,603
We got ten hungry piggies,
there in the back.

413
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:31,501
You can practice on them.
Just pull over, feed them.

414
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,608
- That little Hamhock's my favorite.
- You've got to hurry up.

415
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,334
He's a cute little bugger.

416
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,571
Why are you not using your claws?

417
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:39,646
Would you please just shut up!
I'm on it!

418
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,307
- Just use your claws!
- Be quiet.

419
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,477
- Your claws!
- I don't have any claws, all right?!

420
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:47,814
Was that Hamhock?

421
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:56,322
There, there.
Sleepy, sleepy, big, fat piggy.

422
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,092
Remember when we had to pretend
we had that monkey one time...?

423
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:02,670
You babysit.

424
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,940
- Soft paws.
- When did we have a monkey?

425
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,671
Well?

426
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,711
What happened last time...
You sat on it, Jack.

427
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,941
Hello, beans of legend.

428
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:15,907
Let's go.

429
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:28,520
Well, well, well.
Look what we have here, Jill.

430
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,326
You messed with our baby.

431
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:35,667
And you took my beans.

432
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,502
Sausage bomb!

433
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:48,176
You're gonna pay for this!
Soul-sucking cats!

434
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,545
Signal the egg!

435
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,586
Yes!

436
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,586
- OK.
- Ready.

437
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,752
- Set.
- Go!

438
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,377
Oh, my God!

439
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:40,294
All right, cat. Give me them beans.

440
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:44,434
Is it true
a cat always lands on its feet?

441
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,405
No! That is just a rumor spread by dogs!

442
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:49,772
Well, let's find out.

443
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:59,585
See? I told you I wouldn't let you down!

444
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,485
You think this is over?

445
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:09,492
Hey, that was close!

446
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:20,901
Now!

447
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:27,348
We just got to make it to that bridge!
Hang on!

448
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,276
- Humpty! There is no bridge!
- Trust me.

449
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,294
Humpty!

450
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,627
We're going to die!

451
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,474
I hate cats.

452
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,276
This is war!

453
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:12,654
Giant's castle...

454
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:14,819
here we come.

455
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,832
I must hand it to the egg.

456
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,800
This was a team effort.
Humpty still has his claws...

457
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,966
I mean, flaws. That was what I meant,
not claws. He's not a cat.

458
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:31,345
- Not to say there's anything wrong...
- I don't want to talk about it.

459
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,004
Got it.

460
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,879
OK, we should be close!

461
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,246
Keep your eyes out
for any strange cloud activity!

462
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:43,186
I am called Kitty Softpaws
because I'll steal you blind

463
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:45,554
and you'll never know I was there.

464
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:52,892
Kitty?

465
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,202
You are not as good as they say.

466
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,201
You're better.

467
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,837
I will respect your privacy.

468
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:12,510
OK. I'll tell you.

469
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,420
I was just a stray...

470
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,587
but I had beautiful claws.

471
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:23,625
One day,
a really nice couple took me in.

472
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,132
Gave me milk every morning.

473
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,633
Loved me.

474
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:34,466
Maybe I scratched their curtains
or played too rough with the hamster.

475
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,976
I don't know why they did it.

476
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:39,703
But they took my claws.

477
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:43,545
Cat people are crazy.

478
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,317
Stop the coach! I think this is it!

479
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,641
Can you believe this, Puss?

480
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,576
After all these years!

481
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:17,245
Here. I want you to plant them.

482
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:26,253
That... is a strange cloud.

483
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:31,760
OK! This is it! It's happening, hurry!

484
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,268
This way!

485
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:38,031
Good, good.
Come on, come on, come on.

486
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:40,669
Twenty-three divided by cloud depth.

487
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,538
Hole! Right here.

488
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,447
Now place the beans.

489
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,210
Place the beans carefully, please.

490
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:54,185
Not on top of each other.
The magic is very delicate.

491
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:58,524
OK, good. Very good
Now just stand back.

492
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,232
What's happening here?

493
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,340
Maybe the magic rubbed off
in your pocket?

494
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:48,670
- That's impossible.
- OK, OK. Let's not panic.

495
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:50,903
You know, I read somewhere
that plants have feelings.

496
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:54,743
So, come on...
say something nice to it.

497
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:55,906
OK.

498
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,580
Let me just think for a second.

499
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,511
Hi, little plant.

500
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,165
Guys?

501
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:25,704
Humpty!

502
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:28,867
- I do not see him. Do you see him?
- I don't see him anywhere.

503
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,343
You sound weird.

504
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,343
It's the thin air!

505
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:39,185
Come on in! It feels great!

506
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:48,493
The cloud, it tickles my nose.

507
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,065
That's because they effervesce!
Who knew?

508
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,367
Come on.

509
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:18,353
Gotcha!

510
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:23,691
Meow.

511
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:27,929
Hey, Puss.
What do you think? Do I shave?

512
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,428
Let me show you something.

513
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,048
Somewhere down there,
there are two little kids,

514
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,343
I don't know, maybe orphans,

515
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:45,419
and they're laying on a hill,
staring at the clouds,

516
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,522
dreaming about the future.

517
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:50,188
That was me and you, Puss.

518
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:52,850
Me and you.

519
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:55,958
Boys!

520
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,863
You might want to take a look at this.

521
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,366
The giant's castle.

522
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,569
OK, time to suit up.

523
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:11,769
Humpty!

524
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,438
I'll fit right in with the golden eggs.

525
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,778
Brilliant or what, huh?

526
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:23,550
Humpty, you're not wearing underwear!

527
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:27,457
What? Are you embarrassed? I'm not.

528
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,566
Puss, remember when everyone
was laughing at Bean Club?

529
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:35,602
And who is laughing now? We are!

530
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:48,246
Wow!

531
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:03,665
That is our target.

532
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,858
Hey, you don't sound
like an elf any more.

533
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,764
It's because the air pressure
in here is normal.

534
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:08,960
Let's go.

535
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:16,637
So here is the plan: You two get
the golden eggs, I will fight the giant.

536
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,542
There's no giant to fight.
The giant's been dead for years.

537
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,979
- What?!
- You didn't do the reading, did you?

538
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:25,484
Jack and the Beanstalk, chapter 14,
"Giant Takes a Big Dirt Nap."

539
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:27,215
Ankle burn.

540
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,358
- What was that?
- They call it the Great Terror.

541
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,963
It's the monster that guards
the Golden Goose.

542
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,690
Legend has it that if you look at it,
you'll turn to stone.

543
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:42,326
But nobody really knows because
nobody's walked away from it alive.

544
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:44,403
Follow me and keep quiet.

545
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:55,744
Shh! Humpty!

546
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:58,887
I can't help it.
Everything's rubbing and pinching!

547
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,680
I need powder!

548
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:19,100
How are we gonna get across?

549
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:20,367
Champagne.

550
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:25,342
Cheers!

551
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,592
Do not worry. I will protect you.

552
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:45,097
What are you gonna do?
Hit it in the head with a guitar?

553
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:48,429
Please. Stop bringing up the guitar.

554
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,255
Catch me!

555
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,615
Hurry!

556
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:14,121
Hide!

557
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:16,997
Don't look at it!

558
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:25,463
- Humpty! Be quiet!
- I'm hyperventilating!

559
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:29,407
I said I couldn't breathe and then
you zipped the thing over my mouth!

560
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:32,577
You gotta get it together. Come on!

561
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:33,908
OK.

562
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:52,832
Look at this. It's egg paradise.

563
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:57,128
It's so beautiful,
I feel like I belong here.

564
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,377
Golden eggs.

565
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:08,211
Grab as many as you can.

566
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:12,882
I thought they were going to be
like chicken size.

567
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:17,321
Can you imagine laying
one of these? Ouch!

568
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:18,892
Puss!

569
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:23,456
How are we supposed to
get these out of here?

570
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,894
I don't know.

571
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,236
Oh, my!

572
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:35,234
The Golden Goose.

573
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,574
Just look at her. Isn't she beautiful?

574
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:52,683
My sweet darling.

575
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:56,361
I think she likes you.

576
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:00,733
Let's just take her.

577
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,598
Wait a minute.
This is the goose of legend.

578
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:04,534
We don't know what happens
if we take her.

579
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:09,009
I know what happens
if we don't take her, we got nothing.

580
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:13,410
Guys, guys. It's a gold peeper.
We're taking it!

581
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:24,117
Almost there!

582
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:28,188
Hang on!

583
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,229
Hang on!

584
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:57,725
It's coming!

585
00:51:57,881 --> 00:51:59,326
Rum.

586
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,338
Kitty!

587
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:20,240
What are you doing?

588
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:44,304
Hang on!

589
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:50,041
Come here, you.

590
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:54,974
Got you!

591
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:57,884
She's mine now!

592
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:09,060
Hello!

593
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:17,837
Oh, no! Fly, little gosling, fly!

594
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:25,178
No! It's not supposed to be this way!

595
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,843
- Puss?
- No.

596
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:39,149
I'm sorry.

597
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:56,499
Thanks, Ginger.

598
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:05,117
We should maybe cut that down.

599
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:13,350
Look at that. You finally
got that family you wanted, Jack.

600
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:16,395
Did you hear that?
I think he just called me Daddy.

601
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:20,901
- He looks just like you, Jack.
- Thank you.

602
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:33,144
Well, what is it?

603
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:46,757
I do believe that's our cue.

604
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,730
To paying back San Ricardo!

605
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:55,460
To being rich!

606
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,763
<i>Olé!</i>

607
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:12,512
You.

608
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:13,979
Me?

609
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,680
Yeah, yeah, baby!

610
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,158
One, two, cha-cha-cha!

611
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,319
Three, four, cha-cha-cha!

612
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,294
One, two... What?!

613
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:29,827
There is one word for you,
Kitty Softpaws: Me-wow!

614
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:34,942
I know you have quite a reputation
with the ladies, Mr. Friskie Two-Times.

615
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:38,272
I've also been known as the...
Furry Lover!

616
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,443
But that was before I met you.

617
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:47,611
You don't know me, Puss. I'm not who
you think I am. I'm all about the score.

618
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:52,850
Come on. Look me in the eyes and
tell me all you care about is the gold.

619
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,124
Puss...

620
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:56,355
Kitty...

621
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:58,522
Oh, my God!

622
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:01,891
New partners!

623
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:06,573
Do not fall for his animal magnetism.
You stay focused.

624
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:09,235
What?!

625
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:20,647
So... I have been thinking,
Miss Softpaws,

626
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:24,417
that when we go our separate ways,
we can go our separate ways...

627
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:26,250
together.

628
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:30,525
Puss, you have to go, now.

629
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:34,362
You do not have to push me away
any more. You can trust me.

630
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:39,837
Give it up for the legends of San
Ricardo, Humpty and Puss! We did it!

631
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:45,339
- I'm calling it a night, guys.
- Kitty! Stay up with us.

632
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:49,348
No, I feel a... hairball coming on.

633
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:52,351
OK, yeah. Have fun with that!

634
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:55,046
We should give her some privacy.

635
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,083
I never thought we would get to here.

636
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:03,186
After all we went through...

637
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,025
to pull this off, together.

638
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:10,694
It is good to have my brother back.

639
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,242
Yep. Sure is.

640
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:17,066
Well, we have a big day tomorrow.

641
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:20,077
Pretty exciting stuff.

642
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:21,909
We should get some rest.

643
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,412
Good night, Humpty.

644
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:33,085
Canasta!

645
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:07,161
I am still alive!

646
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:14,457
Jack and Jill.

647
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,133
Kitty?

648
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:18,465
Humpty?

649
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:22,966
I will find you.

650
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:28,974
Get out of here!

651
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:24,435
Be gone!

652
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:29,499
What do you want? Gold? I have gold!

653
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:32,510
Jack, egg's trying to bribe us.

654
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:34,012
With our own gold.

655
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:36,411
Come on now,
all we want is a little breakfast.

656
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,417
- No, no, please!
- How do you like your eggs, pumpkin?

657
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,249
Humpty, no!

658
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,090
Hello, Puss.

659
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,095
Surprise!

660
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:55,130
What is going on?

661
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:59,239
It's a surprise party,
and the surprise is on you.

662
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:01,966
Looks like the cat's out of the bag.

663
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:03,701
You were in cahoots?!

664
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:06,142
Oh, yeah! They all work for me.

665
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:13,548
I spent a lot of time in prison
preparing for this.

666
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:16,418
- You set me up.
- Oh, yeah, I set you up. Of course.

667
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:20,925
You think this was all about getting
the gold and clearing your name?

668
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:25,430
This little adventure
was about one thing.

669
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:27,924
Revenge.

670
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:33,839
You never knew it, Puss...
but I was always there.

671
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:59,027
You wanted to repay an old debt, Puss?
Well, so did I.

672
01:00:59,188 --> 01:01:00,599
Why would you do this?

673
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:02,168
You left me on that bridge!

674
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,464
You abandoned me
when I needed you the most.

675
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:07,164
- What happened to "brothers forever"?!
- I trusted you!

676
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,367
Well, now you're finally gonna know
what it feels like,

677
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:12,342
you know, to trust someone
and have them stab you in the back.

678
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,311
Guards!

679
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:19,283
Puss In Boots, you're under arrest
for the robbery of the San Ricardo Bank!

680
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:21,444
Consider this the final meeting
of Bean Club.

681
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:23,488
I should scramble you with onions!

682
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:27,227
You should never have come back.

683
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:31,363
Pequeño! Wait.

684
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,660
Do not fight them, please.

685
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:36,633
Mama! Listen to me. I can explain.

686
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:41,173
No. Puss, no more running.

687
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:45,506
Please stop breaking my heart
and face what you have done.

688
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:50,177
I'm sorry, Mama.

689
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:52,676
I let you down.

690
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:57,914
Paws where we can see them!

691
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:01,084
Turn around... slow.

692
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:04,764
Slower!

693
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,542
Step into the carrier... quiet-like.

694
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:26,278
Attention! Attention, everyone! If you
could just come in a little closer.

695
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:32,051
Ladies and gentlemen, I present
to you... the Golden Goose of legend!

696
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,593
Kitty. Not you, too?

697
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:46,941
Gold for everyone!

698
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:52,103
We got some fresh,
hot gold here, people!

699
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:55,613
Step right up! Get it hot!

700
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:58,945
<i>Huevos! Huevos! Huevos!</i>

701
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:08,362
One hat.

702
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:10,724
One belt.

703
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:13,060
And two boots...

704
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:16,066
once a symbol of honor.

705
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:20,333
One bottle of catnip?

706
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,140
It is for my glaucoma.

707
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:30,242
This is where you belong, outlaw.

708
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:34,752
And this is where you will stay...
forever.

709
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:55,269
No, no. Don't stop on my account.

710
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:11,723
Well, it looks like the egg
got what he wanted.

711
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,724
You're talking about Humpty?

712
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:19,196
Don't say his name! I used to
share this cell with that smelly thing.

713
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:22,336
Happiest day of my life
was when he left.

714
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:25,199
Till I realized he stole my magic beans.

715
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:28,501
Wait, wait, wait!
You had the beans? Who are you?

716
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,073
Hey! What's your name?

717
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:34,078
Andy Beanstalk!

718
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:36,080
My friends call me Jack.

719
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:39,584
I traded the family cow for them beans.

720
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:41,688
Course'n, it wasn't my family's cow.

721
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:44,757
It was some other family's family cow.
That's why I got eight to ten.

722
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:48,919
Always know which cow is yours.

723
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,062
Crazy man. Wake up!

724
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:54,227
What else do you know?

725
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:58,099
We're all goners,
thanks to that little stinky!

726
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:03,540
I told him not to take the goose,
but all he wanted was his revenge!

727
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:06,043
Don't take the goose. Why?

728
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:13,414
The Great Terror!
That's the Golden Goose's mama.

729
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:14,884
Oh, no.

730
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:17,718
And she will be out for blood

731
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:21,418
when she comes back for her baby.

732
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:26,231
Guard! San Ricardo is in terrible
danger! You must listen to me!

733
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:27,732
Quiet, you!

734
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:53,090
Shut up.

735
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:12,777
Open the door.

736
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:22,011
Drop the weapon.

737
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:25,159
Very good.

738
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:27,487
Step aside.

739
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:29,661
No.

740
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,628
Diablo Gato!

741
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:33,795
Nice try.

742
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:48,514
I hope you can forgive me.

743
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:51,481
Apology accepted!

744
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:54,548
I don't really have time for you.

745
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,815
I have to save the town
from the Great Terror!

746
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:58,822
Wait, Puss!

747
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:00,892
Don't you see? I'm here because...

748
01:07:01,884 --> 01:07:04,660
I am here
because you made me realize

749
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,892
that there is something
I care about more than gold.

750
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:10,633
Something?

751
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:13,672
OK. Someone.

752
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:16,708
He's about two feet tall,
wears high heels.

753
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,345
Handsome?

754
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:20,481
He's very handsome.

755
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:21,876
A real beefcake?

756
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,013
- A stallion?
- Yes.

757
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:26,050
- Tiger?
- Oh, brother.

758
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:29,649
But this does not make us even.

759
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:30,813
Freeze!

760
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,425
Yes, it does.

761
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:34,254
No, no, no, it doesn't.

762
01:07:38,154 --> 01:07:39,599
I saved you!

763
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:42,191
You owed me one.

764
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,766
You didn't tell me about Humpty.

765
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:48,533
So now you owe me two.

766
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:55,775
- You're a lot of work.
- I know. But I am worth it!

767
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,855
You are not getting away, Puss In Boots!

768
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:05,014
Wrong boots.

769
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:07,083
Kitty!

770
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,922
Now we're even!

771
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:19,935
This is your San Ricardo weather report.

772
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,702
Chances of a giant goose
destroying the town...

773
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:24,938
one hundred percent.

774
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:32,647
Never alone, always together...

775
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:34,151
<i>Humpty and Puss...</i>

776
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:36,085
<i>Brothers forever.</i>

777
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:43,963
Come on, sweetie. Let's get
out of here before Mama shows up.

778
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,930
I should make you
into an egg salad sandwich!

779
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:49,558
That is disgusting!

780
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:51,227
Give me the goose, Humpty.

781
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:53,304
No can do, I'm afraid.

782
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,464
See, the mama's on her way,
and when she gets here,

783
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:59,977
it's bye-bye San Ricardo
and everything you ever cared about!

784
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:03,982
Revenge on me is one thing,
but why Imelda? Why the orphanage?

785
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,676
This is our home.

786
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:07,252
You mean your home.

787
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:11,981
I never belonged here.

788
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,491
We had a plan to get out of here,

789
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:17,825
but then you became a hero
and you picked this place over me.

790
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,998
You left me with nothing.

791
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,669
Humpty... I'm sorry I hurt you.

792
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:35,115
But do not take it out on these people.
You are better than this!

793
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:38,644
- No, I'm not.
- Oh, come on!

794
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:40,514
I know the real Humpty.

795
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:44,818
The way you saw the world!
The inventor! The dreamer!

796
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:47,290
What happened to that guy?

797
01:09:52,655 --> 01:09:55,135
I... I think it's too late.

798
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:57,794
It is never too late
to do the right thing.

799
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,031
Together we can save San Ricardo!

800
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:09,408
I can forgive you, Humpty...
if you help me now.

801
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:11,711
Really?

802
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:14,252
After everything I put you through?

803
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:17,220
Prove to me there is still
a good egg in you.

804
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:20,993
I'll try.

805
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:14,040
Goggles, check.

806
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:16,740
Get the baby over the bridge.
I'll get the mother to follow.

807
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:18,407
OK. Give me a...

808
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:19,917
Puss!

809
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:45,234
Mama Goose!

810
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:50,575
Wait!

811
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:54,186
Just follow me
and I will lead you to your baby.

812
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:01,857
No! Not that way!

813
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:05,324
<i>Pequeño,</i> help!

814
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:06,966
Hang on!

815
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,175
That's my boy!

816
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:25,485
Come with me, Mama Goose.
I know where your baby is.

817
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:27,917
Here. Look!

818
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:41,231
Humpty, pick up the pace!

819
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:43,870
I'm trying, Puss! I'm trying!

820
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,475
Sorry, egghead,
we want more than just eggs.

821
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:54,409
So how about you give us that goose!

822
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:55,514
Humpty!

823
01:12:57,339 --> 01:12:58,340
Get her off!

824
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:03,682
- Nice moves.
- What would you do without me?

825
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:09,556
Freeze!

826
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:14,428
Comandante!

827
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:16,069
I can explain?

828
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:21,766
Gato, you are going back to jail
if it's the last thing I do!

829
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:23,238
Humpty, hurry!

830
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:26,710
We're almost there. We're almost there!

831
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:53,567
- Puss, help!
- Humpty, hang on!

832
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:55,868
Puss!

833
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,250
Here we are again, right, Puss?

834
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:13,282
I will not leave you behind
this time, Humpty.

835
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:23,634
I'm sorry, Puss.

836
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:25,465
I've made a mess out of everything.

837
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:29,006
I'm a rotten egg.

838
01:14:29,164 --> 01:14:31,770
I'm not a person.

839
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:35,108
I'm not a bird. I'm not even a food.

840
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:38,581
I don't know what I am.

841
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:42,187
You are what you have always been.

842
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:44,451
My brother.

843
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:48,523
Brothers forever.

844
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:05,338
- You can't save us both.
- Yes, I can! Just hang on!

845
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:11,978
Puss, you have to save the baby,
or the mama will destroy San Ricardo.

846
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:15,712
It's the right thing to do.

847
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:21,857
I will not let you go, Humpty.

848
01:15:22,951 --> 01:15:24,362
I know you won't.

849
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:27,360
So I won't make you choose.

850
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:29,498
Humpty!

851
01:15:51,413 --> 01:15:53,324
I'm very sorry.

852
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:55,052
She's OK.

853
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:04,767
Humpty?

854
01:16:22,878 --> 01:16:26,621
I always knew that you were good inside.

855
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:42,135
Goodbye, Humpty.

856
01:16:52,874 --> 01:16:56,083
- Yeah, I think it's wonderful.
- And I got a goose egg.

857
01:16:56,745 --> 01:16:58,247
It's him. Puss In Boots.

858
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:00,415
He saved us from the giant goose!

859
01:17:00,582 --> 01:17:02,357
His sword is like lightning!

860
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:04,428
They say he has ten lives.

861
01:17:04,586 --> 01:17:08,398
His boots are made
of the finest Corinthian leather.

862
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:10,833
He only drinks whole milk.

863
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:15,637
Good leche.

864
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:19,335
He's no outlaw. He saved us!

865
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:21,671
Meow?

866
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:26,009
A gift for you, Mama.

867
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:32,692
I have to go.
The soldiers are coming for me.

868
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:37,023
I am so proud of you, my son.

869
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:44,131
Today, you faced the past
with bravery and honor.

870
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:47,372
You earned those boots.

871
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:52,535
And the people know that
you are San Ricardo's greatest hero.

872
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:55,542
I did it for you, Mama.

873
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:59,347
You will always be in my heart.

874
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,715
And you in mine.

875
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:06,359
EC-Faro!

876
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:09,155
- There he is!
- I see him!

877
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:54,601
I will see you again, Kitty Softpaws!

878
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:56,765
Sooner than you think.

879
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,582
She is a bad kitty.

880
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:16,424
<i>This is the story of a cat
who became a hero.</i>

881
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:21,091
<i>An outlaw dedicated to justice.
And a lover of beautiful women.</i>

882
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:24,897
<i>A great... great lover.</i>

883
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,700
<i>Really. It is crazy.</i>

884
01:19:27,863 --> 01:19:30,901
<i>Lam Puss In Boots!</i>

885
01:19:31,066 --> 01:19:35,606
<i>And my name would become... legend!</i>

886
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:09,308
Meow.
