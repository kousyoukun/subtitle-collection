latest movies at highest quality and smallest size

2
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:39,664
Through the years,
I have been known by many names.

3
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,376
Diablo Gato.

4
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,962
The Furry Lover.

5
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,381
Chupacabra.

6
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,050
Friskie Two-Times.

7
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,386
And the Ginger Hit Man.

8
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:58,766
But to most... I am Puss In Boots!

9
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,561
Outlaw.

10
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,264
I will never forget you... Margherita.

11
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,767
I mean, Rosa.

12
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,979
Sorry. I think maybe I should go.

13
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,646
You cannot run forever,

14
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,981
Puss In Boots!

15
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,325
What can I say? I was a bad kitty.

16
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,334
Just a fugitive from the law...
forever running.

17
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,088
Searching for a way to clear my name.

18
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,009
And I would get that chance...

19
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:01,013
...on this one fateful night.

20
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,230
Here, kitty, kitty!

21
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,900
Raoul.

22
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,737
Look what the cat dragged in.

23
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,906
Oh, wait... That is the cat!

24
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,246
One leche, please.

25
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:15,087
What are you doing here, señor?
Did you lose your ball of yarn?

26
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,302
So funny.

27
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,596
One leche coming up.

28
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,779
I am not looking for trouble.

29
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,788
I am but a humble gato
in search of his next meal.

30
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,416
Perhaps you gentlemen
can help me find a simple score?

31
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:57,463
The only thing you'll find tonight
is trouble... Puss In Boots.

32
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:12,311
Well, perhaps if one of us were to
tell the law that you are in town,

33
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,814
we could split the reward.

34
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,617
You made the cat angry.

35
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,829
You do not want to make the cat angry!

36
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,084
The Church of St. Michael
has just put up a golden statue

37
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,669
of the Virgin of Guadalupe.

38
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,671
I do not steal from churches.

39
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,757
The boys' orphanage has been donated
silver candlesticks,

40
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,551
they would look very lovely
in your home.

41
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,553
I do not steal from orphans.

42
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,680
What about Jack and Jill?

43
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,850
- Shh! Are you crazy?
- The what?

44
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,439
The murderous outlaws Jack and Jill

45
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,609
have gotten their hands on...
magic beans.

46
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,237
Do not joke with me about magic beans!

47
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:07,908
I searched half my life for them.
They do not exist.

48
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,245
No, cat. We have seen them.

49
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:15,583
These... are the beans of legend.

50
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:21,505
Grows a vine to the Land of Giants,

51
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,425
and the Golden Goose.

52
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,176
The Golden Goose...

53
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,263
A heist like this
could set you up for life.

54
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,265
All nine of them.

55
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,559
Show him the golden eggs.

56
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,102
No!

57
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,063
Please, you have shown enough.

58
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:43,110
Only a cat with a death wish would
steal the beans from Jack and Jill.

59
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:49,783
The only wish I have
is to repay an old debt.

60
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,952
And this is my chance.

61
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,455
Now...

62
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,625
...where do I find this Jack and Jill?

63
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,621
I'm sorry... we have no rooms.

64
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,212
Well, I think one just opened up.

65
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,678
We'd like a complimentary
continental breakfast.

66
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:54,223
And don't even think about skimpin'
on them baby muffins.

67
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,858
We don't have any baby muffins.

68
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,323
You know, Jill...

69
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,617
...I been thinking.

70
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,035
Get it out.

71
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:19,206
I... Once we're done
with this magic bean business

72
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:22,543
and got ourselves
all them beautiful golden eggs...

73
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,044
Go on.

74
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,965
...that we cut down on some
of the hijacking and murdering.

75
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,718
I mean, it's fun and all, but...

76
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,097
...I want a baby.

77
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,563
A baby what, Jack?

78
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:47,276
A baby us, Jill. We'll raise it wild,
like a squirrel or something.

79
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,030
Holy frijoles!

80
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,032
They do exist.

81
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,951
Ever since you fell down that hill
and broke your crown,

82
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,619
you have been talking crazy.

83
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,627
It couldn't hurt to have
an extra shooter during ambushes.

84
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,006
Maybe I cut too deep...
cut that brain out of your head.

85
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,926
Hey! What gives?

86
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,222
If it's to be a girl,
she'll have your strong...

87
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,433
No! No! No!

88
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,644
You, you, you! You stop where you are!

89
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,565
I don't know, Jack. How do I ride and
shoot with a baby slung on my back?

90
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,110
They got them backpacks now.
The way I see it, Jill...

91
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,113
Those beans are mine!

92
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,658
...we fall off this flat earth one time.
What better proof of our love...

93
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,826
Me?

94
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,705
You snap me?

95
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,459
You snap me?!

96
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,307
You looking for something?

97
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,314
No.

98
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,608
No hablo inglés.

99
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,532
You are going to pay for this!

100
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,316
No!

101
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,949
Chupacabra!

102
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,951
Chupacabra! Chupacabra!

103
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,537
- Chupacabra!
- You are a crazy woman!

104
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,594
Those magic beans were my score!

105
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:03,847
You just cost me a chance
at getting the golden eggs, mi amigo.

106
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,099
Put up your dukes.

107
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,396
Very well.

108
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,356
If it is to be a dance fight,

109
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,901
then I will Tuesday-Night-Dance-Fight
you to the death!

110
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,175
How dare you do the Litter Box at me!

111
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,137
Hello!

112
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,911
Can you feel me?

113
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,934
Fear me... if you dare.

114
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,135
You hit me in the head with a guitar?!

115
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,220
You are a woman?

116
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,186
Amateur.

117
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,564
Wow!

118
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,942
Señorita, wait!

119
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:50,991
Let me buy you some leche!
I am a lover, not a fighter.

120
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,246
Hello?

121
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:59,291
You are hiding from me?

122
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,043
I like to play the games, too.

123
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:07,257
I sense in you a kindred spirit, a...

124
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,263
I smell something familiar.

125
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,185
Something... dangerous.

126
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,729
Something...

127
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,814
...breakfasty.

128
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,234
It's been a long time, brother.

129
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,948
Maldito huevo.

130
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:39,247
Humpty Alexander Dumpty.

131
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,417
How dare you show your face to me.

132
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:47,088
I know you're angry.
You have every right.

133
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,759
But it is good to see you, Puss.

134
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,344
Are those new boots?

135
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:57,098
No! They are the same boots I wore
when you betrayed me.

136
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,684
Betrayed you?

137
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,313
You left me cracked in pieces
on a bridge, surrounded by soldiers!

138
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:04,731
They wrote a song about it!

139
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:08,068
And how did we get on that bridge
in the first place?!

140
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,112
Because we were brothers, and brothers
are supposed to look after each other...

141
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,447
Humpty!

142
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,701
Remember why we're here.

143
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,371
I should have known.

144
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,457
I had the magic beans in my grasp,

145
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:27,295
and you sent this very attractive
devil woman to interfere.

146
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,297
You are a curse on my life!

147
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,049
Wait. Hear me out. OK?

148
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,760
Yes, yes,
I sent Kitty to bring you here.

149
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,096
But she is no ordinary thief.

150
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,558
She's Kitty Softpaws.

151
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,893
The softest touch in Spain.

152
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,021
That's a lot of heel for a guy,
don't you think?

153
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,987
Look, with Kitty's skill,
your sword and my brain,

154
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,738
we've got a fighting chance here.

155
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,825
Puss, come on, you of all people
know that nobody's ever ripped off

156
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,536
the giant's castle
and lived to tell the tale.

157
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,955
You want to survive? You need a plan.

158
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:07,502
And I've studied this job my whole life.
You know that.

159
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,796
Let's be honest.

160
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,465
Without me, you don't even know
where to plant the beans, Puss.

161
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,885
But Jack and Jill do.
They're on their way.

162
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:22,309
We go up the beanstalk outlaws,
and we come down legends.

163
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,313
So what do you say?

164
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,315
Partners?

165
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,987
No. Never again.

166
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,492
I'm sorry, OK?
How long are you gonna hold a grudge?

167
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,830
It's been seven years!
That's like 35 cat years.

168
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:47,500
You need me! And I need you.

169
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:53,632
Puss! You got any idea what they do
to eggs in San Ricardo prison?

170
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,013
I'll tell you this, my friend.

171
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,016
It ain't over easy.

172
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:10,690
Adiós... Humpty Dumpty.

173
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,865
Oh, this is bad. This is bad.

174
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:23,370
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
I know how to speak meow.

175
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,247
...sad story with your twisted lies

176
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,292
in your greasy shell
that smells like old ham!

177
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,670
I should crack you open for...

178
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,557
Look what I found.

179
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,561
Someone forgot his money.

180
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,734
Oh, you are dangerous.

181
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,654
Humpty says you like danger.

182
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:04,494
Just think of all the trouble
we can get into.

183
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:09,749
The two of us together.

184
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,920
We can steal a lot of golden eggs.

185
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,429
And... you owe me.

186
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,931
I owe you?

187
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,101
You hit me in the head with a guitar.

188
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,270
I regret the guitar.

189
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,939
OK, I forgive you.

190
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,442
So... you're in?

191
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:41,781
There is one teeny, tiny,
itty-bitty problem.

192
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,616
And what is that?

193
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,786
You work for the egg!

194
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:52,125
Come on, Puss. What happened between
you and Humpty that was so bad?

195
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,130
I am afraid with me and Humpty...

196
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,425
...the scars are too deep.

197
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,932
It all started a long time ago.

198
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,894
Oh, no. You really don't have to tell me
your whole life story, please.

199
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,896
You may want to sit.

200
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:18,151
It is at times quite... painful.

201
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,153
OK, here we go.

202
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:24,657
It was a year
in which the rain had not fallen.

203
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:29,162
The wind was big
and the basket was small.

204
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,581
For days, I bounced along...

205
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,502
...a hungry little kitten
with no milk, no mama,

206
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,504
and no litter box.

207
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:42,175
Until I came to rest at a home
for lost children.

208
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,685
Her name was Imelda.

209
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:57,315
And, like a mother, she took me
into her heart and raised me as her own.

210
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:03,738
Silencio.

211
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:06,115
She was an angel of kindness.

212
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,201
¡Silencio!

213
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,453
Most of the time.

214
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:14,207
I'd like to introduce
a new boy joining us.

215
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:18,044
It's OK, pequeño.
You show with the face.

216
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,299
Go on.

217
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:32,141
And that was the moment I met...

218
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,269
Humpty Alexander Dumpty.

219
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,857
Hey, Whiskers! You're sitting
in Little Boy Blue's chair.

220
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,484
Oh, come on. Is this necessary?

221
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,653
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?

222
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,613
Who asked you, Breakfast?

223
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,282
Remember what Imelda says, Boy Blue:

224
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,535
If you're going to blow your top,
you blow your horn instead, right?

225
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:51,953
Let's spin him.

226
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,372
Please don't spin me. Do not spin me!

227
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,958
Not again! No! I'm going to yolk!

228
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:00,795
Even though he took my beans,
the egg stood up for me,

229
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,755
and I decided then...

230
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,341
...that I would always have his back.

231
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,766
Wow!

232
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,269
That was very impressive. Thanks!

233
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:18,855
Hey, egg boy!

234
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:25,862
There was something about this
strange little egg that intrigued me.

235
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:46,257
Oh... it's you.
I've been collecting for months now.

236
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,885
You never know when you're gonna
get lucky. You know what I mean?

237
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,306
Magic beans... is what they are.

238
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:55,934
Hello?

239
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,895
You gonna tell all the other kids
that I believe in magic now?

240
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:00,855
Is that what you're gonna do?

241
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,484
No? What's your name?

242
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,654
You don't say much, do you?

243
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,239
I think I'll call you Sparky.

244
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:12,575
Whiskers?

245
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,993
Zoltar!

246
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,413
How about Puss?

247
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,627
Humpty's mind
was full of imagination and invention.

248
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,420
What is that, 50 feet down there?

249
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,131
Here we go. Give me a...

250
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,008
Puss!

251
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,721
Look at me, Puss! I'm flying!

252
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:40,353
He spoke of legends and adventures
beyond my wildest dreams.

253
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:43,898
When I find those magic beans,
they'll grow a vine

254
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,150
straight up into the clouds,

255
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:50,655
where a terrible and a fearsome giant
hoards his greatest treasure...

256
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,324
...the Golden Goose.

257
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,785
Oh, the Golden Goose. Just one.

258
00:24:55,953 --> 00:25:00,581
Just one of her golden eggs...
could set me for life.

259
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,251
It's my destiny, Puss.

260
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:08,423
I can't really explain it,
but I just feel like I belong up there.

261
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,596
Oh, boy. This is awkward.

262
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,766
This is kind of a solo dream here.

263
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,770
I don't need any dead weight,
you know, holding me down.

264
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,898
What are you doing?

265
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:31,571
Oh, man, that's good. The eye thing that
you're doing, that is really splendid.

266
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:35,616
OK, let me just think for a second.
All right... OK.

267
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,202
This is crazy, but...

268
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,539
...I am considering a partnership.

269
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,043
I just need to know one thing.

270
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,420
Can you commit?

271
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,797
Sí... I can commit.

272
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:53,384
Oh, you can talk!
Could you help me up?

273
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:56,971
OK...

274
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,141
First rule of Bean Club...

275
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:04,479
...you do not talk about Bean Club.

276
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,731
Second rule of Bean Club...

277
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,943
...is you don't talk about Bean Club.
You ready?

278
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,195
Ready.

279
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,698
From this day forth,
it shall be known...

280
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:19,035
Never alone, always together...

281
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,536
Humpty and Puss...

282
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,330
Brothers forever.

283
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,791
And from that moment on,

284
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:29,128
we were united on a great adventure
to find the magic beans.

285
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,379
Help me up.

286
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,048
Egg me.

287
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,300
Humpty was the brains...

288
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:36,928
- Good gracious!
- I never saw him!

289
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,639
- That really hurt!
- ...and I was the skill.

290
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,141
I'm cracked!

291
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:49,065
We got red beans, green beans, coffee
beans, lima beans... but no magic beans.

292
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:52,151
Would you care for a jelly bean?

293
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,486
Thank you.

294
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:56,489
Finding them meant everything to us.

295
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,659
I almost forgot
the most important thing.

296
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,911
That's me and you, Puss.

297
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,914
Me and you.

298
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,583
But we never did find them.

299
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:11,003
And, as years passed,
the quest for magic beans

300
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:15,424
seemed more and more
like the dreams of a child.

301
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:20,513
As teenagers,
Humpty and I looked for trouble...

302
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,849
...and often found it.

303
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:27,186
Third time this month, Imelda.
Next time is jail time.

304
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,564
They're just kids.

305
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,358
They are thieves.

306
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,198
You are better than this.

307
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,535
I believe in you with all my heart.

308
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:45,454
Please do not let me down.

309
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:50,793
I hate this place.
I cannot wait for us to get out of here.

310
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,589
Throw a rock.
It'll make you feel better.

311
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,634
Oh, boy. We should go.

312
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,723
On instinct, I reacted.

313
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:21,199
He saved the Comandante's mother!

314
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,665
You saved my mother.

315
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:33,419
Señor Puss... he is a hero!

316
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:41,093
Today we see that courage and bravery
come in all sizes!

317
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:45,806
Little did I know that one moment
would change my whole life.

318
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,559
These are for you, my boy.

319
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:53,606
Wear them as a symbol of honor...
and justice.

320
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:57,526
I will make you proud, Mama.

321
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:02,740
You already have, my Puss In Boots.

322
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:08,287
How strange it was
to give a cat boots...

323
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,624
...but, whoa... I looked good!

324
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,627
And as the light of my path
grew brighter...

325
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:19,131
...Humpty's road grew ever darker.

326
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,306
Gracias, Comandante.

327
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,892
Be careful of the company you keep.

328
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:35,064
I know! I know, I never should've
tried something without you.

329
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:38,734
You're not stealing lollipops anymore,
Humpty. This is getting serious.

330
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,279
You're right!
We have to be smarter about this.

331
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,656
Here, look. We need to think bigger.

332
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:46,575
I've been casing the silversmith
and it's perfect.

333
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,203
You and me, in and out,
50 seconds tops.

334
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,998
Will you put that away!
This is our home.

335
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,792
These people have done nothing to us.

336
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,421
Our home? OK, yeah, I get it now.

337
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:02,008
You get some fancy boots
and now you're too good for me?

338
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,551
That is not true.

339
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,803
We weren't born here.
We're orphans!

340
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,763
All we got is each other,
you understand?

341
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,557
We are better than this.

342
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,476
But we're partners.

343
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,687
We are brothers.

344
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,149
But I am not stealing anymore.

345
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,446
But Humpty would not give up so easily.

346
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,281
I'm in trouble, Puss!

347
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,658
It's Boy Blue and his gang.
I owe them some money.

348
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,036
They're coming for me.
Just get me over this wall.

349
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:33,664
I gotta go. Help me up the wall.
Get me up the wall. Hurry! Hurry!

350
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,970
OK, I've got everything. We did it.
Come on, let's go!

351
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:49,638
How could you do this to me?!

352
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,266
I did you a favor!
We can finally get out of here!

353
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:55,144
This is the money of the people!
This is all they have!

354
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,650
You disgrace those boots!

355
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,694
Comandante, please, I can explain!

356
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,071
Arrest them!

357
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,369
Hurry up! Get to the bridge!

358
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:15,706
- You tricked me!
- I had to! You left me no choice!

359
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:24,757
Mama...

360
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,759
Pequeño.

361
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,677
Watch out!

362
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,445
Oh, no.

363
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,614
Puss. I can't get up.

364
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,991
Puss! Help me. I can't get up!

365
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,493
Freeze!

366
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,079
Puss, save me!

367
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,206
Save yourself.

368
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,583
We got you.

369
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:18,185
I lost everything
I cared about that day.

370
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,021
My brother.

371
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,690
My honor.

372
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,191
My home.

373
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:30,448
All I thought about was the
disappointment in my mama's eyes.

374
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,368
And I have been running ever since.

375
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,875
The egg betrayed me.

376
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:44,712
His lies cost me everything.

377
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,717
- Hey!
- I'm awake!

378
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,011
You think I don't want to fix the past?

379
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,099
I can't get down.

380
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:10,029
Listen. A day... A day doesn't go by

381
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,323
when I don't think about what I lost.

382
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,036
I lost my best friend.

383
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,455
My only friend.

384
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:22,583
And I get it now. I got greedy
and desperate and I let you down.

385
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,793
I let myself down.

386
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,463
All I'm asking for, Puss,
is a second chance.

387
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:31,842
Give me that second chance
and I'll help you pay back San Ricardo.

388
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:34,762
Please, Puss.

389
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,723
Let me show you
what our friendship meant to me.

390
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,272
- I will do it.
- That's great.

391
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,653
I will do this for my mother
and for San Ricardo... not for you.

392
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,323
We are not partners
and we are not friends.

393
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:59,995
OK. I promise this time,
I will not let you down.

394
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,331
Yes!

395
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,834
I think we got our Bean Club back.

396
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,565
Humpty's plan better work.

397
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:32,736
Listen, you just need to worry about
your part. Don't screw it up.

398
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,239
- What?
- Again with the mask?

399
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:38,993
I don't need style advice
from Mr. Dusty Boots.

400
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,335
Come on, Puss. Now!

401
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,217
Our biological clocks
are tickin', darlin'.

402
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:58,053
- You gotta look at the big picture.
- What's your problem?

403
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,473
Listen.
I put a lot of work into my body.

404
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,602
I look good, and I am not
just gonna throw that away.

405
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,648
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

406
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,275
- We're gonna start small.
- Look.

407
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,402
Let's just pretend you have a baby.

408
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,405
Excellent.

409
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,162
I don't have time to be at home
with no diapers and baby socks.

410
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,998
You don't have to, Jill.
I'll be the stay-at-home dad.

411
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,584
We got ten hungry piggies,
there in the back.

412
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:31,503
You can practice on them.
Just pull over, feed them.

413
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,589
- That little Hamhock's my favorite.
- You've got to hurry up.

414
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,341
He's a cute little bugger.

415
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,551
Why are you not using your claws?

416
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,637
Would you please just shut up!
I'm on it!

417
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,306
- Just use your claws!
- Be quiet.

418
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:45,476
- Your claws!
- I don't have any claws, all right?!

419
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,811
Was that Hamhock?

420
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,320
There, there.
Sleepy, sleepy, big, fat piggy.

421
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,075
Remember when we had to pretend
we had that monkey one time...?

422
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,660
You babysit.

423
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,913
- Soft paws.
- When did we have a monkey?

424
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,625
Well?

425
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,669
...what happened last time...
You sat on it, Jack.

426
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,921
Hello, beans of legend.

427
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:15,923
Let's go.

428
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:28,519
Well, well, well.
Look what we have here, Jill.

429
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,313
You messed with our baby.

430
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,651
And you took my beans.

431
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,487
Sausage bomb!

432
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:48,163
You're gonna pay for this!
Soul-sucking cats!

433
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,541
Signal the egg!

434
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,585
Yes!

435
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,591
- OK.
- Ready.

436
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,760
- Set.
- Go!

437
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,361
Oh, my God!

438
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:40,299
All right, cat. Give me them beans.

439
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,428
Is it true
a cat always lands on its feet?

440
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,389
No! That is just a rumor spread by dogs!

441
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,767
Well, let's find out.

442
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,568
See? I told you I wouldn't let you down!

443
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,487
You think this is over?

444
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,495
Hey, that was close!

445
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:20,881
Now!

446
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:27,346
We just got to make it to that bridge!
Hang on!

447
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:31,266
- Humpty! There is no bridge!
- Trust me.

448
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,274
Humpty!

449
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,615
We're going to die!

450
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,462
I hate cats.

451
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,256
This is war!

452
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,641
Giant's castle...

453
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,810
...here we come.

454
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,815
I must hand it to the egg.

455
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,776
This was a team effort.
Humpty still has his claws...

456
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:27,948
I mean, flaws. That was what I meant,
not claws. He's not a cat.

457
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,326
- Not to say there's anything wrong...
- I don't want to talk about it.

458
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,995
Got it.

459
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:35,873
OK, we should be close!

460
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,251
Keep your eyes out
for any strange cloud activity!

461
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,171
I am called Kitty Softpaws
because I'll steal you blind

462
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,549
and you'll never know I was there.

463
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:52,890
Kitty?

464
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,184
You are not as good as they say.

465
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,188
You're better.

466
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,819
I will respect your privacy.

467
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,492
OK. I'll tell you.

468
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,412
I was just a stray...

469
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,582
...but I had beautiful claws.

470
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:23,629
One day,
a really nice couple took me in.

471
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,131
Gave me milk every morning.

472
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:27,633
Loved me.

473
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:34,473
Maybe I scratched their curtains
or played too rough with the hamster.

474
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,975
I don't know why they did it.

475
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,686
But they took my claws.

476
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,523
Cat people are crazy.

477
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,319
Stop the coach! I think this is it!

478
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,633
Can you believe this, Puss?

479
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,552
After all these years!

480
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:17,224
Here. I want you to plant them.

481
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:26,233
That... is a strange cloud.

482
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,738
OK! This is it! It's happening, hurry!

483
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,243
This way!

484
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,036
Good, good.
Come on, come on, come on.

485
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,664
Twenty-three divided by cloud depth.

486
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,541
Hole! Right here.

487
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:47,421
Now place the beans.

488
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,216
Place the beans carefully, please.

489
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:54,177
Not on top of each other.
The magic is very delicate.

490
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:58,515
OK, good. Very good.
Now just stand back.

491
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,226
What's happening here?

492
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,312
Maybe the magic rubbed off
in your pocket?

493
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,648
- That's impossible.
- OK, OK. Let's not panic.

494
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,901
You know, I read somewhere
that plants have feelings.

495
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:54,738
So, come on...
say something nice to it.

496
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:55,906
OK.

497
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,575
Let me just think for a second.

498
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:00,494
Hi, little plant.

499
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,160
Guys?

500
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,704
Humpty!

501
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,874
- I do not see him. Do you see him?
- I don't see him anywhere.

502
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,334
You sound weird.

503
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,337
It's the thin air!

504
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:39,176
Come on in! It feels great!

505
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,476
The cloud, it tickles my nose.

506
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,063
That's because they effervesce!
Who knew?

507
00:44:58,196 --> 00:44:59,362
Come on.

508
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:18,340
Gotcha!

509
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:23,678
Meow.

510
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:27,933
Hey, Puss.
What do you think? Do I shave?

511
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:30,435
Let me show you something.

512
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,028
Somewhere down there,
there are two little kids,

513
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,322
I don't know, maybe orphans,

514
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,408
and they're laying on a hill,
staring at the clouds,

515
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,494
dreaming about the future.

516
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:50,163
That was me and you, Puss.

517
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,832
Me and you.

518
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:55,961
Boys!

519
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:59,839
You might want to take a look at this.

520
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,345
The giant's castle.

521
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,558
OK, time to suit up.

522
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:11,768
Humpty!

523
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:14,437
I'll fit right in with the golden eggs.

524
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,776
Brilliant or what, huh?

525
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:23,530
Humpty, you're not wearing underwear!

526
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:27,450
What? Are you embarrassed? I'm not.

527
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,539
Puss, remember when everyone
was laughing at Bean Club?

528
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:35,583
And who is laughing now? We are!

529
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,221
Wow!

530
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:03,653
That is our target.

531
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,864
Hey, you don't sound
like an elf anymore.

532
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,741
It's because the air pressure
in here is normal.

533
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:08,950
Let's go.

534
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:16,624
So here is the plan: You two get
the golden eggs, I will fight the giant.

535
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,544
There's no giant to fight.
The giant's been dead for years.

536
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:21,963
- What?!
- You didn't do the reading, did you?

537
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:25,467
Jack and the Beanstalk, chapter 14,
"Giant Takes a Big Dirt Nap."

538
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:27,218
Ankle burn.

539
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,350
- What was that?
- They call it the Great Terror.

540
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,935
It's the monster that guards
the Golden Goose.

541
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,688
Legend has it that if you look at it,
you'll turn to stone.

542
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:42,317
But nobody really knows because
nobody's walked away from it alive.

543
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,402
Follow me and keep quiet.

544
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:55,747
Shh! Humpty!

545
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:58,875
I can't help it.
Everything's rubbing and pinching!

546
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:00,668
I need powder!

547
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,104
How are we gonna get across?

548
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,355
Champagne.

549
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,318
Cheers!

550
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,582
Do not worry. I will protect you.

551
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:45,088
What are you gonna do?
Hit it in the head with a guitar?

552
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:48,425
Please. Stop bringing up the guitar.

553
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,236
Catch me!

554
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,614
Hurry!

555
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:14,117
Hide!

556
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:16,995
Don't look at it!

557
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,462
- Humpty! Be quiet!
- I'm hyperventilating!

558
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:29,382
I said I couldn't breathe and then
you zipped the thing over my mouth!

559
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,552
You gotta get it together. Come on!

560
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,887
OK.

561
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:52,822
Look at this. It's egg paradise.

562
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:57,118
It's so beautiful,
I feel like I belong here.

563
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,375
Golden eggs.

564
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:08,213
Grab as many as you can.

565
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:12,884
I thought they were going to be
like chicken size.

566
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:17,305
Can you imagine laying
one of these? Ouch!

567
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:18,890
Puss!

568
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,436
How are we supposed to
get these out of here?

569
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:24,896
I don't know.

570
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:29,234
Oh, my!

571
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:35,240
The Golden Goose.

572
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:39,577
Just look at her. Isn't she beautiful?

573
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,674
My sweet darling.

574
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,344
I think she likes you.

575
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:00,723
Let's just take her.

576
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,600
Wait a minute.
This is the goose of legend.

577
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,519
We don't know what happens
if we take her.

578
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:08,982
I know what happens
if we don't take her, we got nothing.

579
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:13,403
Guys, guys. It's a gold pooper.
We're taking it!

580
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:24,122
Almost there!

581
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:35,216
Hang on!

582
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,697
It's coming!

583
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,324
Run!

584
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,341
Kitty!

585
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:20,219
What are you doing?

586
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,285
Hang on!

587
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,041
Come here, you.

588
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:54,962
Got you!

589
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:57,882
She's mine now!

590
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,060
Hello!

591
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:17,819
Oh, no! Fly, little gosling, fly!

592
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:25,159
No! It's not supposed to be this way!

593
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,830
- Puss?
- No.

594
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,132
I'm sorry.

595
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,482
Thanks, Ginger.

596
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:05,116
We should maybe cut that down.

597
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:13,332
Look at that. You finally
got that family you wanted, Jack.

598
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,377
Did you hear that?
I think he just called me Daddy.

599
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:20,882
- He looks just like you, Jack.
- Thank you.

600
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,144
Well, what is it?

601
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:46,741
I do believe that's our cue.

602
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:53,706
To paying back San Ricardo!

603
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:55,458
To being rich!

604
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:56,751
¡Olé!

605
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:12,517
You.

606
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:13,976
Me?

607
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,686
Yeah, yeah, baby!

608
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,149
One, two, cha-cha-cha!

609
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,318
Three, four, cha-cha-cha!

610
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,278
One, two... What?!

611
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:29,826
There is one word for you,
Kitty Softpaws: Me-wow!

612
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:34,914
I know you have quite a reputation
with the ladies, Mr. Friskie Two-Times.

613
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:38,251
I've also been known as the...
Furry Lover!

614
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:42,421
But that was before I met you.

615
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:47,593
You don't know me, Puss. I'm not who
you think I am. I'm all about the score.

616
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:52,849
Come on. Look me in the eyes and
tell me all you care about is the gold.

617
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:55,101
Puss...

618
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:56,352
Kitty...

619
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:58,521
Oh, my God!

620
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:01,899
New partners!

621
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:06,571
Do not fall for his animal magnetism.
You stay focused.

622
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:09,240
What?!

623
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,626
So... I have been thinking,
Miss Softpaws,

624
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:24,422
that when we go our separate ways,
we can go our separate ways...

625
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,257
...together.

626
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,511
Puss, you have to go, now.

627
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:34,348
You do not have to push me away
anymore. You can trust me.

628
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:39,812
Give it up for the legends of San
Ricardo, Humpty and Puss! We did it!

629
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:45,318
- I'm calling it a night, guys.
- Kitty! Stay up with us.

630
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:49,322
No, I feel a... hairball coming on.

631
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,325
OK, yeah. Have fun with that!

632
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:55,036
We should give her some privacy.

633
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:00,082
I never thought we would get to here.

634
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:03,169
After all we went through...

635
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:06,005
...to pull this off, together.

636
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:10,676
It is good to have my brother back.

637
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,221
Yep. Sure is.

638
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:17,058
Well, we have a big day tomorrow.

639
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:20,061
Pretty exciting stuff.

640
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:21,896
We should get some rest.

641
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,399
Good night, Humpty.

642
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,074
Canasta!

643
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,149
I am still alive!

644
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,448
Jack and Jill.

645
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:17,118
Kitty?

646
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,452
Humpty?

647
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:22,957
I will find you.

648
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:28,963
Get out of here!

649
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,435
Be gone!

650
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:29,482
What do you want? Gold? I have gold!

651
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:32,485
Jack, egg's trying to bribe us.

652
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:33,986
With our own gold.

653
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:36,405
Come on now,
all we want is a little breakfast.

654
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,408
- No, no, please!
- How do you like your eggs, pumpkin?

655
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,243
Humpty, no!

656
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,085
Hello, Puss.

657
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,087
Surprise!

658
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,132
What is going on?

659
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:59,220
It's a surprise party,
and the surprise is on you.

660
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,972
Looks like the cat's out of the bag.

661
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,682
You were in cahoots?!

662
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:06,143
Oh, yeah! They all work for me.

663
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:13,526
I spent a lot of time in prison
preparing for this.

664
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:16,403
- You set me up.
- Oh, yeah, I set you up. Of course.

665
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:20,908
You think this was all about getting
the gold and clearing your name?

666
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:25,412
This little adventure
was about one thing.

667
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:27,915
Revenge.

668
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,838
You never knew it, Puss...
but I was always there.

669
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:59,029
You wanted to repay an old debt, Puss?
Well, so did I.

670
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,573
Why would you do this?

671
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,158
You left me on that bridge!

672
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,451
You abandoned me
when I needed you the most.

673
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:07,163
- What happened to "brothers forever"?!
- I trusted you!

674
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,373
Well, now you're finally gonna know
what it feels like,

675
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:12,334
you know, to trust someone
and have them stab you in the back.

676
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,295
Guards!

677
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:19,258
Puss In Boots, you're under arrest
for the robbery of the San Ricardo Bank!

678
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,427
Consider this the final meeting
of Bean Club.

679
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:23,470
I should scramble you with onions!

680
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:27,224
You should never have come back.

681
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:31,353
¡Pequeño! Wait.

682
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,647
Do not fight them, please.

683
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,609
Mama! Listen to me. I can explain.

684
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:41,155
No. Puss, no more running.

685
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:45,492
Please stop breaking my heart
and face what you have done.

686
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:50,164
I'm sorry, Mama.

687
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,666
I let you down.

688
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:57,922
Paws where we can see them!

689
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,091
Turn around... slow.

690
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:04,762
Slower!

691
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,521
Step into the carrier... quiet-like.

692
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:26,283
Attention! Attention, everyone! If you
could just come in a little closer.

693
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:32,039
Ladies and gentlemen, I present
to you... the Golden Goose of legend!

694
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,588
Kitty. Not you, too?

695
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,929
Gold for everyone!

696
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:52,101
We got some fresh,
hot gold here, people!

697
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:55,604
Step right up! Get it hot!

698
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:58,941
¡Huevos! ¡Huevos! ¡Huevos!

699
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:08,367
One hat.

700
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:10,703
One belt.

701
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,038
And two boots...

702
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:16,041
...once a symbol of honor.

703
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:20,337
One bottle of catnip?

704
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,132
It is for my glaucoma.

705
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:30,222
This is where you belong, outlaw.

706
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:34,727
And this is where you will stay...
forever.

707
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:55,247
No, no. Don't stop on my account.

708
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:11,722
Well, it looks like the egg
got what he wanted.

709
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:13,724
You're talking about Humpty?

710
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:19,188
Don't say his name! I used to
share this cell with that smelly thing.

711
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:22,316
Happiest day of my life
was when he left.

712
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:25,194
Till I realized he stole my magic beans.

713
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:28,489
Wait, wait, wait!
You had the beans? Who are you?

714
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,076
Hey! What's your name?

715
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,078
Andy Beanstalk!

716
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:36,080
My friends call me Jack.

717
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:39,583
I traded the family cow for them beans.

718
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:41,668
Course'n, it wasn't my family's cow.

719
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:44,755
It was some other family's family cow.
That's why I got eight to ten.

720
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:48,926
Always know which cow is yours.

721
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,054
Crazy man. Wake up!

722
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:54,223
What else do you know?

723
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:58,102
We're all goners,
thanks to that little stinky!

724
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:03,524
I told him not to take the goose,
but all he wanted was his revenge!

725
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:06,026
Don't take the goose. Why?

726
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:13,409
The Great Terror!
That's the Golden Goose's mama.

727
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:14,868
Oh, no.

728
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,704
And she will be out for blood

729
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:21,417
when she comes back for her baby.

730
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:26,213
Guard! San Ricardo is in terrible
danger! You must listen to me!

731
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:27,714
Quiet, you!

732
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:53,073
Shut up.

733
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:12,759
Open the door.

734
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:22,019
Drop the weapon.

735
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:25,147
Very good.

736
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,483
Step aside.

737
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,651
No.

738
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,612
Diablo Gato!

739
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,780
Nice try.

740
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:48,504
I hope you can forgive me.

741
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:51,465
Apology accepted!

742
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:54,551
I don't really have time for you.

743
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,803
I have to save the town
from the Great Terror!

744
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,805
Wait, Puss!

745
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,891
Don't you see? I'm here because...

746
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:04,645
I am here
because you made me realize

747
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:07,898
that there is something
I care about more than gold.

748
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:10,609
Something?

749
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:13,654
OK. Someone.

750
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:16,698
He's about two feet tall,
wears high heels.

751
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,325
Handsome?

752
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:20,452
He's very handsome.

753
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:21,870
A real beefcake?

754
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:23,997
- A stallion?
- Yes.

755
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:26,041
- Tiger?
- Oh, brother.

756
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:29,628
But this does not make us even.

757
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:30,796
Freeze!

758
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:32,422
Yes, it does.

759
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,258
No, no, no, it doesn't.

760
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:39,596
I saved you!

761
01:07:40,682 --> 01:07:42,182
You owed me one.

762
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,768
You didn't tell me about Humpty.

763
01:07:46,938 --> 01:07:48,522
So now you owe me two.

764
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:55,779
- You're a lot of work.
- I know. But I am worth it!

765
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:02,828
You are not getting away, Puss In Boots!

766
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:04,997
Wrong boots.

767
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,082
Kitty!

768
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,917
Now we're even!

769
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:19,928
This is your San Ricardo weather report.

770
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,681
Chances of a giant goose
destroying the town...

771
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:24,933
...one hundred percent.

772
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,649
Never alone, always together...

773
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:34,151
Humpty and Puss...

774
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,069
Brothers forever.

775
01:08:38,573 --> 01:08:43,952
Come on, sweetie. Let's get
out of here before Mama shows up.

776
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,913
I should make you
into an egg salad sandwich!

777
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,541
That is disgusting!

778
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:51,209
Give me the goose, Humpty.

779
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,295
No can do, I'm afraid.

780
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:55,464
See, the mama's on her way,
and when she gets here,

781
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:59,968
it's bye-bye San Ricardo
and everything you ever cared about!

782
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:03,972
Revenge on me is one thing,
but why Imelda? Why the orphanage?

783
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,682
This is our home.

784
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,225
You mean your home.

785
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,980
I never belonged here.

786
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,482
We had a plan to get out of here,

787
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:17,819
but then you became a hero
and you picked this place over me.

788
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,989
You left me with nothing.

789
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,664
Humpty... I'm sorry I hurt you.

790
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:35,087
But do not take it out on these people.
You are better than this!

791
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:38,632
- No, I'm not.
- Oh, come on!

792
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,509
I know the real Humpty.

793
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:44,805
The way you saw the world!
The inventor! The dreamer!

794
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:47,265
What happened to that guy?

795
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:55,107
I... I think it's too late.

796
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,776
It is never too late
to do the right thing.

797
01:09:57,944 --> 01:10:00,028
Together we can save San Ricardo!

798
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:09,413
I can forgive you, Humpty...
if you help me now.

799
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,707
Really?

800
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:14,251
After everything I put you through?

801
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:17,212
Prove to me there is still
a good egg in you.

802
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:20,966
I'll try.

803
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:14,019
Goggles, check.

804
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:16,730
Get the baby over the bridge.
I'll get the mother to follow.

805
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:18,398
OK. Give me a...

806
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:19,900
Puss!

807
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,217
Mama Goose!

808
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,555
Wait!

809
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:54,184
Just follow me
and I will lead you to your baby.

810
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:01,858
No! Not that way!

811
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:05,320
Pequeño, help!

812
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:06,947
Hang on!

813
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,166
That's my boy!

814
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:25,465
Come with me, Mama Goose.
I know where your baby is.

815
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:27,926
Here. Look!

816
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:41,231
Humpty, pick up the pace!

817
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:43,859
I'm trying, Puss! I'm trying!

818
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,450
Sorry, egghead,
we want more than just eggs.

819
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:54,411
So how about you give us that goose!

820
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:55,495
Humpty!

821
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:58,331
Get her off!

822
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:03,670
- Nice moves.
- What would you do without me?

823
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:09,551
Freeze!

824
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,431
Comandante!

825
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:16,057
I can explain?

826
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:21,771
Gato, you are going back to jail
if it's the last thing I do!

827
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:23,231
Humpty, hurry!

828
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:26,693
We're almost there. We're almost there!

829
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:53,553
- Puss, help!
- Humpty, hang on!

830
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:55,847
Puss!

831
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,233
Here we are again, right, Puss?

832
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:13,281
I will not leave you behind
this time, Humpty.

833
01:14:21,749 --> 01:14:23,625
I'm sorry, Puss.

834
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,460
I've made a mess out of everything.

835
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:29,005
I'm a rotten egg.

836
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:31,758
I'm not a person.

837
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:35,095
I'm not a bird. I'm not even a food.

838
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:38,556
I don't know what I am.

839
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:42,185
You are what you have always been.

840
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,437
My brother.

841
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:48,525
Brothers forever.

842
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:05,333
- You can't save us both.
- Yes, I can! Just hang on!

843
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:11,965
Puss, you have to save the baby,
or the mama will destroy San Ricardo.

844
01:15:14,135 --> 01:15:15,719
It's the right thing to do.

845
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:21,850
I will not let you go, Humpty.

846
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,352
I know you won't.

847
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:27,355
So I won't make you choose.

848
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:29,482
Humpty!

849
01:15:51,422 --> 01:15:53,298
I'm very sorry.

850
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,050
She's OK.

851
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:04,768
Humpty?

852
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:26,623
I always knew that you were good inside.

853
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:42,138
Goodbye, Humpty.

854
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:56,069
- Yeah, I think it's wonderful...
- And I got a goose egg.

855
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:58,238
It's him. Puss In Boots.

856
01:16:58,405 --> 01:17:00,406
He saved us from the giant goose!

857
01:17:00,574 --> 01:17:02,367
His sword is like lightning!

858
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:04,410
They say he has ten lives.

859
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:08,373
His boots are made
of the finest Corinthian leather.

860
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:10,834
He only drinks whole milk.

861
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:15,630
Good leche.

862
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:19,342
He's no outlaw. He saved us!

863
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:21,678
Meow?

864
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:26,015
A gift for you, Mama.

865
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:32,689
I have to go.
The soldiers are coming for me.

866
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:37,026
I am so proud of you, my son.

867
01:17:39,947 --> 01:17:44,117
Today, you faced the past
with bravery and honor.

868
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,370
You earned those boots.

869
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:52,542
And the people know that
you are San Ricardo's greatest hero.

870
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:55,545
I did it for you, Mama.

871
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:59,340
You will always be in my heart.

872
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,718
And you in mine.

873
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:06,347
¡Gato!

874
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:09,142
- There he is!
- I see him!

875
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:54,604
I will see you again, Kitty Softpaws!

876
01:18:54,772 --> 01:18:56,773
Sooner than you think.

877
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:07,575
She is a bad kitty.

878
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:16,417
This is the story of a cat
who became a hero.

879
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:21,089
An outlaw dedicated to justice.
And a lover of beautiful women.

880
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:24,884
A great... great lover.

881
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:27,679
Really. It is crazy.

882
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:30,890
I am Puss In Boots!

883
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:35,603
And my name would become... legend!

884
01:20:08,012 --> 01:20:09,304
Meow.

885
01:20:14,305 --> 01:21:10,305
