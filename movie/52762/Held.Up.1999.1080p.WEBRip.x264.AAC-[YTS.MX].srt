OH, YOU BACK OFF!
I CAN BE DANGEROUS.

177
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,496
HI, I NEED TO GET
TO AN AIRPORT.

178
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,664
WE AREN'T TAKING SIDES.

179
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,582
AIRPORT?
COME ON, RAE.

180
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,875
AN AIRPORT?
THAT'S CRAZY.

181
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,210
OH, YOU AIN'T SEEN
CRAZY YET, EITHER.

182
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,504
Man on intercom:
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN AIRPORT?

183
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:48,546
YEAH.

184
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,173
YEAH, ACTUALLY,
HI, I AM.

185
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,008
YEAH, I TOLD YOU ONCE
TO STAY OUT OF OUR BUSINESS.

186
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,553
Man on intercom:
LAS VEGAS IS JUST A SHORT
DRIVE AROUND THE CANYON.

187
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,096
OH, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

188
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,014
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

189
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,224
AFTER ALL THAT I'VE DONE.

190
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,226
TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER
A NICE LITTLE VACATION.

191
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,185
AND THIS IS
THE WAY YOU ACT?

192
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,853
YOU CALL THIS
A NICE VACATION?

193
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,106
AND NOW WE'RE SPENDING
THE REST OF OUR TIME
DRIVING BACK TO CHICAGO

194
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,901
TO LOOK FOR A HOUSE
THAT WE SUDDENLY
CAN'T AFFORD?

195
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,237
Man on intercom:
THAT MONEY WAS FOR A HOUSE?

196
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,571
YES!
CAN YOU BELIEVE HIM?

197
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:19,702
AND HE BOUGHT
THIS STUPID PIECE
OF SHIT BATMOBILE.

198
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,205
YOU KNOW,
I-I'M OUT OF HERE.

199
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,123
THAT'S IT.

200
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,916
RAE--IT'S NOT
A BATMOBILE, BRO.

201
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,043
RAE, WHERE YOU GOING?

202
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,378
AWAY FROM YOU.

203
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,089
LOOK, DON'T
MAKE ME CALL OUT
YOUR NAME, GIRL.

204
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,090
I WISH YOU WOULD.

205
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,633
I'LL CALL OUT YOUR NAME.

206
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,260
I'M GONNA
CALL OUT YOUR NAME.

207
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,177
MMM-HMMM.

208
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,887
I'LL CUSS YOU.

209
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:38,888

212
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,102
YOU'RE GETTING STRONG.

213
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,145
YOU AIN'T GOTTA TAKE IT
OUT ON THE CAR, EITHER.

214
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,857
HEY! DON'T
DISRESPECT ME, WOMAN.

215
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:49,941
HONOR THINE BOYFRIEND,

216
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,609
LIKE IT SAYS
IN THE BIBLE.

217
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,738
THERE'S A FLIGHT TO CHICAGO
LEAVING VEGAS AIRPORT
TONIGHT AT 6:00.

218
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,740
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU
WEREN'T TAKING SIDES.

219
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,784
I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WOULD BE SO EASY.

220
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:05,331
Man on intercom:
MICHAEL, SPENDING THAT MONEY
VIOLATED A TRUST, A BOND.

221
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,292
I'M GONNA SNATCH SOME
WIRES OUT YOUR ASS.

222
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,085
Man: WE'RE HEADED
THAT WAY, MA'AM.

223
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,628
AND YOU'RE SURE WELCOME
TO RIDE WITH US.

224
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:14,299
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T MIND RIDING
IN THE BACK WITH THE BOYS.

225
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,886
THE BOYS?

226
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:25,018
OH, MAN.

227
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:25,977
HOWDY.
HI.

228
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,103
THEY DON'T
WANT YOU, RAE.

229
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,397
THEY GOT SPURS THAT
JINGLE JANGLE JINGLE.

230
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,816
THEY GOT ROPES
AND NO STEERS.

231
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,067
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

232
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,611
LOOK, RAE, LISTEN.

233
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,029
LISTEN, COME ON,
NOW BLACK PEOPLE DON'T
DO THIS KIND OF STUFF.

234
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,655
ALL RIGHT,
MOUNTAIN CLIMBING,

235
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,823
GETTING LOST
IN THE FOREST

236
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,783
AND TAKING RIDES WITH
PEOPLE WE DON'T KNOW.

237
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,868
WE DON'T DO THAT.

238
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,870
SO LET'S
JUST CHILL, OK?

239
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,038
GOOD-BYE, MICHAEL.

240
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:45,955
I'M LEAVING.

241
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,123
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE LEAVING?

242
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,082
I CAN'T DO THIS.

243
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,125
YOU CAN'T DO WHAT?

244
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,127
I CAN'T BE WITH
YOU ANYMORE, MICHAEL.

245
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,879
YOU ARE
REALLY TRIPPING.

246
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,089
OH, NOW YOU'RE GONNA
GIVE THE RING BACK.

247
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:59,677
OK, COME ON.

248
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,096
WELL, I SPENT A LOT
OF MONEY ON THE RING.

249
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,765
NO, I DIDN'T MEAN IT
LIKE THAT, RAE. LOOK--

250
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:07,226
I MAY NOT BE AN EXPERT,
MICHAEL, BUT WOMEN LIKE
TO FEEL IMPORTANT.

251
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:11,481
IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS,
LIKE SENDING THEM FLOWERS
FOR NO REASON,

252
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:15,109
OR LEAVING LITTLE NOTES
IN THEIR SOCK DRAWERS.

253
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,946
UNCLE FESTER,
IF YOU DON'T GET UP
OUT OF HERE--

254
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,739
OK, LOOK, RAE, YOU DONE
HAD YOUR LITTLE FUN,

255
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,866

BEVERLY HILLBUDDIES
AND EVERYTHING,

256
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,326
BUT I'M GONNA COUNT TO 3

257
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,955
AND I WANT YOU TO GET
YOUR NARROW TAIL OFF
OF THIS TRUCK.

258
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,456

00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,041

260
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,250
I'M AT TWO, RAE.

261
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,044
THIS IS TWO.

262
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,089
OK, WELL, GO ON THEN.

263
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,423
I DON'T NEED YOU.

264
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,883
I'M JUST PLAYING, RAE.

265
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,093
RAE, I'M PLAYING.

266
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,095
WHAT ABOUT MY RING?

267
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,222
I'LL FED EX IT TO YOU!

268
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:48,434
AND DON'T TRY TO CALL
MY MAMA'S HOUSE.

269
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,520
GIRL, YOUR MOTHER LOVES ME.

270
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,897
WHAT?

271
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,024
I'LL CALL IF I WANT TO.

00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,038
WASN'T STUPID, MAN.

00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,206
I WAS JUST IN A HURRY.

00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,874
YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL,
THIS IS A CLASSIC CAR.

280
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,085
DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

281
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,837
I CAN OPEN IT,
YOU KNOW.

282
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:16,838
YOU CAN?

1043
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,462
Rodrigo: MICHAEL,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1044
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:33,007
MICHAEL, GET BACK HERE!

1045
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,844
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA SHOOT ME, MAN.

1046
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:39,972
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES.

1047
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:42,391
MICHAEL!

1048
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:44,351
[GUNFIRE]

1049
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:51,358
YOU GOT LYIN' EYES.

1050
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:56,071
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
SHOOTING AT IN THERE?

1051
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,031
YOU WANT TO BE
A TERRORIST, HUH?

1052
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:59,116
WELL YOU GOT
YOUR CHANCE. COME ON.

1053
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,117
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1054
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,244
WE'RE ABOUT
TO NEGOTIATE. COME ON!

1055
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:05,581
OK, BUT YOU TALK
TO HIM.

1056
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:06,540
SHERIFF...

1057
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,250
LOOK, I'M SICK
OF THIS, MAN!

1058
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,253
I'VE BEEN ROBBED,
KIDNAPPED, SHOT AT...

1059
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,714
I COULD'VE STAYED
IN CHICAGO FOR THIS SHIT!

1060
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:16,425
AND ALL YOUR TRIGGER-HAPPY
"BOSS HOGG" ASS CAN DO

1061
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,177
IS TURN OFF
THE AIR CONDITIONING.

1062
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:19,803
I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

1063
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,014
WHAT DO YOU WANT, TYSON?

1064
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:25,434
OK, HE'LL RELEASE
ALL OF THE HOSTAGES

1065
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:27,186
IF YOU'LL PROVIDE
TRANSPORTATION

1066
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:29,688
TO THE LAS VEGAS AIRPORT
BY 6:00.

1067
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:30,898
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

1068
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:33,067
LOOK, YOU NEED TO
GET TO MEXICO, RIGHT?

1069
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:35,402
I NEED TO GET TO RAE.

1070
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,071
OK, LISTEN UP.

1071
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:39,948
SOMEBODY IS GOING
WITH ME.

1072
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,076
SOMEBODY BESIDE HIM.

1073
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:43,744
[LAUGHING]

1074
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:46,497
LISTEN, HE NEEDS TO GET
TWO PLANE TICKETS

1075
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:49,958
AND WE NEED TO GET
TRANSPORTATION TO
THE VEGAS AIRPORT BY 6:00,

1076
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,627
AND IF HE DON'T GET
ALL OF THAT...

1077
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:54,421
IF HE DON'T GET
HIS DEMANDS MET, THEN...

1078
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,798
YOU DIE.

1079
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:57,049
THEN WE ALL DIE.

1080
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:59,093
YEAH, EVERYBODY DIES!

1081
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:03,389
6:00, AND I TAKE THIS
AND...BOOM!

1082
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,099
BRAINS EVERYWHERE!

1083
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,016
I'M SERIOUS.

1084
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,226
Mike: THEY KNOW
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

1085
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:08,102
BLOOD AND GUTS.

1086
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:09,144
BLOOD AND GUTS.
SERIOUS SHIT!

1087
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:12,106
HE'S JUST HOT.
IT'S HOT. IT'S REAL HOT.

1088
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:16,985
FIND OUT HOW MUCH
ALL THIS IS GONNA COST.

1089
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:23,867
SHERIFF.

1090
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,253
THIS IS OUR FIRST
TRIP TOGETHER.

1091
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:35,754
YOU KNOW WHAT
I DIDN'T REALIZE?

1092
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:38,173
I DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN
ON A PLANE BEFORE.

1093
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,384
SO I SAT THERE
WITH HER AND I SAID,

1094
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,677
"LOOK, ORDER
WHATEVER YOU WANT."

1095
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:44,054
SHE LOOKS UP
AND SEES THE FLIGHT
ATTENDANT BUTTON

1096
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,806
WITH THE LITTLE SPEAKER
BY IT, SO SHE GOES,

1097
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:51,103
BEEP. "COULD I GET
A DIET COKE?" RIGHT?

1098
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:52,438
SO EVERYBODY STARTS
LAUGHING, YOU KNOW,

1099
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:54,731
BUT I'M LIKE,
"HEY, DON'T LET HER
OFF THE HOOK."

1100
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,066
SO SHE SITS THERE
A LITTLE LONGER

1101
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,276
AND THE DIET COKE
AIN'T CAME,

1102
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:59,570
SO SHE GOES,
"OH, THESE PEOPLE."

1103
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:02,865
BEEP. "I SAID COULD
I GET A DIET COKE,
PLEASE?"

1104
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:04,908
AND IT WAS
JUST HILARIOUS, MAN.

1105
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,660
SHE WAS
JUST SO INNOCENT.

1106
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,328
WHY WERE THEY LAUGHING?

1107
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:11,665
I'M NOT EVEN
WASTING MY TIME.

1108
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:15,377
THAT'S MY LITTLE RAE, MAN.
LITTLE RAE OF SUNSHINE.

1109
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:18,172
THAT'S REALLY PRETTY.
WHERE IS THAT?

1110
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:19,381
IT'S MEXICO.

1111
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,967
YEAH,
IT'S TOPOLOBAMPO.

1112
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:26,013
DAMN, BROTHER.
YOU'RE A TRAVELING MAN.

1113
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:27,514
NO, I WAS BORN THERE.

1114
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,266
HOW DO YOU SAY IT?

1115
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,518

1116
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,020
Jack: NEVER HEARD OF IT.

1117
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,398
Biker: IT'S A SMALL PORT
CITY 20 MILES SOUTH
OF LOS MOCHIS.

1118
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:41,028
IT'S KNOWN FOR ITS TEMPERATE
CLIMATE AND GUAVA BEAN EXPORTS.

1119
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:42,905
OH, REALLY?

1120
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,533
YEAH.

1121
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,784
OH...SEE RIGHT HERE?

1122
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,161
WE'D BE SEEING
EACH OTHER FOR
A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

1123
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:53,749
WE HADN'T EVEN KNOWN
EACH OTHER THAT LONG,
YOU KNOW.

1124
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:55,334
OH-HH...

1125
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:58,795
I'M TELLING YOU,
GLORIA, WE WERE LIKE...

1126
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,131
WE WERE LIKE
THE PERFECT FIT.

1127
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,008
THE FIRST NIGHT WE WERE
TOGETHER, MAN...

1128
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:05,302
OH, MAN. HUMPTY DUMPTY
SAT ON THE WALL.

1129
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:10,265
WE COULD JUST TALK FOR HOURS
AND HOURS ABOUT EVERYTHING.

1130
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:14,686
SHE WOULD TALK FOR HOURS
ABOUT NOTHING,

1131
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:17,940
BUT I DIDN'T MIND
LISTENING.

1132
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,316
Sheriff: HELLO IN THERE...

1133
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:24,112
WE'VE GOT OURSELVES A LITTLE
BIT OF A PROBLEM OUT HERE.

WELL, WHAT WITH
THE COST OF PUTTING UP
THE NEW SCOREBOARD

1137
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,504
AND FISCAL CUTBACKS,

1138
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:45,884
THE MAYOR SAYS
THERE'S NO WAY THAT
WE CAN CHARTER A PLANE.

1139
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:48,428
WE CAN SEND YOU
ON A BUS, THOUGH.

1140
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:51,515
IT GOES DOWN THROUGH
NOGALES AND YUMA.

1141
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:54,393
IT'S A LOT OF PRETTY
SCENERY DOWN THERE.

1142
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:57,938
Biker: HOW ABOUT
FIRST CLASS SEATS?

1143
00:55:57,938 --> 00:55:59,481
Sheriff: IT'S A DAMN BUS!

1144
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:03,527
I GUESS WE COULD PUT YOU
CLOSER TO THE CRAPPER,
OR SOMETHING.

1145
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:05,862
Bike: WHAT
ABOUT DINNER?

1146
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:09,783
UH...IS THERE A MEAL?

THE FUSE IS LIT.

I REPEAT, THE FUSE
HAS BEEN LIT.

1196

HOW LONG IS THIS
GONNA TAKE?

1197
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:36,346
WELL, I REALLY
HAVE NO IDEA.

1198
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:39,099
WHERE THE HELL
IS MY SWAT TEAM?

MIGRANT WORK.

1205
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,073

NO, I'M PRESIDENT

1207
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:57,951
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1208
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:01,538
THINGS WEREN'T GOING

YOU UNDERSTAND?

1380
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:41,094
UM-HMM. OH,
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

1381
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:43,805
THE SUN JUST
POPPED OUT.

1382
01:09:43,805 --> 01:09:46,057
Beau: OK,
HERE'S THE DEAL.

1383
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:49,977
WE WANT YOU TO HELP
US TAKE HIM DOWN.

1384
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:51,187
YOU WILLING
TO PLAY BALL?

1385
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:56,192
UH, ACTUALLY
IT'S STARTING
TO LOOK LIKE RAIN.

1386
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,196
NOW YOU DO YOUR PART,

1387
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:04,659
AND WE'LL MAKE
SURE THAT PLANE
STAYS ON THE GROUND.

1388
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:07,036
WE GOT A DEAL?

1389
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,372
THE WEATHER IS NICE.

1390
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:15,962
Beau: OK, HERE'S
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO.

1391
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:18,840
YOU GET HIM TO RELEASE
EVERYBODY ELSE.

1392
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,050
AND THEN I WANT YOU
TO WALK OUT THERE WITH HIM.

1393
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,969
NOW, YOU KEEP YOUR
EYES ON THE SHERIFF,

1394
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:25,138
BECAUSE HE'S GOING
TO ASK YOU SWING AWAY.

1395
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:27,682
HAND ACROSS THE HAT,
THEN ACROSS THE CHEST

1396
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:30,977
AND THEN WHEN YOU SEE
HIM DO THAT, I WANT
YOU TO HIT THE DIRT.

1397
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:33,438
AND WE'LL TAKE
CARE OF THE REST.

1398
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:34,814
YOU GOT THAT?

1399
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:38,609
OK. WELL, OK,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
DAD, I'LL HOLLER.

1400
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:41,988
ALL RIGHT,
OK, BYE BYE.

1401
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:46,492
YEAH, THAT'S MY DAD.

1402
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:49,829
HE'S AN OLD
RETIRED WEATHERMAN.

1403
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:51,122
OH.

1404
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:57,837
I WANT YOU TO TAKE
HIM OUT WITH THE FIRST
SHOT, BEAU.

1405
01:10:57,837 --> 01:11:00,214
LET'S GET THOSE
KIDS OUT OF HERE.

1406
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:01,883
YES, SIR.

1407
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:07,013
WELL, I'LL BE DAMNED.

1408
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:12,935
Pembry: HELLO IN THERE.

1409
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,270
WE GOT THE BUS OUT HERE.

1410
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:19,108
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO LIVE UP
TO YOUR END OF THE DEAL.

1411
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:21,986
LET'S DO IT.

1412
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:26,032
LET'S CLEAR THESE
CIVILIANS OUT OF HERE.

1413
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:27,283
YES, SIR.

1414
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:28,743
ALL RIGHT, FOLKS,
I NEED YOU ALL
TO MOVE BACK.

1415
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:29,785
GO.

1416
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:31,078
Beau: LET'S MOVE
BACK BEHIND THE CARS.

1417
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:33,748
FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY.
COME ON, MOVE IT,
LET'S GO.

1418
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:35,958
WHAT'S GOING ON, ELI?

1419
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,961
JUST A
PRECAUTIONARY
MEASURE.

1420
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,047
YOU WANT US TO MOVE?

1421
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:44,050
OH, NO. YOU FINE
RIGHT THERE.

1422
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:54,185
CLARENCE, THAT'S ONE
YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR.

1423
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:57,188
THIS IS YOURS.

1424
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:00,107
THANKS.

1425
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:07,615
Jack: FOR GOD'S SAKE,
SIMMS, GET THAT--

1426
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:10,743
IT'S 116 IN THE SHADE.

1427
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,165
Rodrigo: WAIT, WAIT.

1428
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,084
NO GUNS.

1429
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:26,842
Pembry: ALL RIGHT,
LET'S PUT THEM DOWN.

1430
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:30,096
LET'S GO.

1431
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:38,020
IT'S ALL RIGHT, MARY.

1432
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:41,524
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

1433
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:42,692
ARE YOU OK?

1434
01:12:42,692 --> 01:12:43,693
NO, SHE'S NOT OK.

1435
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:45,945
SHE DON'T LIKE BEING
AROUND A KILLER.

1436
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:47,113
I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

1437
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:49,073
THEN WHAT ABOUT
THE DEAD BODY IN
THE CRATE.

1438
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:50,032
WHAT ABOUT THE WHAT?

1439
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,200
THE BODY.

1440
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:55,037
THE BODY IN THE CRATE.

1441
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,914
IT'S MY FATHER.

1442
01:12:56,914 --> 01:13:00,835
I'M TRYING TO TAKE
HIM BACK TO MEXICO.

1443
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:08,259
DON'T STOP MOVING,
DON'T STOP MOVING.

1444
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:17,268
AH!
Rodrigo: MARY!

1445
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:18,853
DROP YOUR WEAPON!
DROP IT.

1446
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:19,687
NO, NO, NO, NO.

1447
01:13:19,687 --> 01:13:20,646
DROP THAT GUN
OR I'LL FIRE.

1448
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:22,982
I JUST WANT TO GO
BACK TO MEXICO.

1449
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:25,026
DROP IT NOW.

1450
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:25,860
OH, NO. WAIT
A MINUTE, SHERIFF.

1451
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,278
MOVE OUT OF
THE WAY, TYSON.

1452
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:28,529
SHERIFF, HE'S
NOT A KILLER.

1453
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:29,822
Pembry: IF YOU
WANT US TO HOLD
THAT DAMN PLANE,

1454
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:32,950
YOU WILL MOVE
YOUR ASS OUT OF
THE WAY RIGHT NOW.

1455
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:35,036
WHAT'S GOING
ON, MICHAEL?

1456
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:37,455
MAN, THEY TRIED TO GET
ME TO SET YOU UP.

1457
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:39,832
YOU DID A PRETTY
GOOD JOB.

1458
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,878
LEAVE HIM ALONE.

1459
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:46,797
AW, HELL.

1460
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:48,674
MARY, YOU DROP THAT WEAPON
AND BACK AWAY FROM HIM.

1461
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:50,134
HE'S GOT A DEAD
BODY IN THERE.

1462
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:56,098
I KNOW. IT'S HIS
FATHER AND HE'S TRYING
TO TAKE HIM HOME.

1463
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:59,810
WELL, THAT DON'T
SEEM TO MAKE A BIG
DIFFERENCE.

1464
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:01,020
HE'S UNDER
ARREST ANYWAY.

1465
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:02,480
Michael: AW,
COME ON SHERIFF.
FOR WHAT CHARGE?

1466
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,775
WELL, FOR ATTEMPTED
MURDER FOR THAT SHOT
HE TOOK AT YOU.

1467
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:08,444
ATTEMPT--WELL, LOOK,
IF YOU CHARGE HIM WITH
ATTEMPTED MURDER,

1468
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:11,238
THEN YOU GOT TO CHARGE HIM
WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER, TOO,

1469
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:14,408
WITH HIS BARNEY FIFE ASS.

1470
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:17,703
ALL RIGHT, MEN, PUT
AWAY YOUR WEAPONS.

1471
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:29,674
WHAT IS IT
YOU WANT, TYSON?

1472
01:14:29,674 --> 01:14:30,883
I WANT WHAT YOU PROMISED.

1473
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:32,593
FIRST OF ALL, I NEED
TO GET THIS DUDE TO MEXICO

1474
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:34,553
SO HE CAN TAKE CARE
OF HIS FATHER.

1475
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:35,930
WE CAN'T DO THAT.

1476
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:37,515
WE DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH MONEY.

1477
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:39,058
WHAT? YOU DON'T
HAVE ENOUGH MONEY?

1478
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:40,351
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

1479
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:42,103
LOOK AT ALL THESE
TAXPAYING CITIZENS
AROUND HERE.

1480
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:43,229
YOU GOT SOME
MONEY IN HERE

1481
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:45,940
COME ON, DON'T
BULLSHIT ME.

1482
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:46,982
TOWN'S BROKE.

1483
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:49,819
Man: WE ARE NOT.

1484
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:53,447
Michael: 50.

1485
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:55,866
OH, COME ON, TYSON,
DON'T DO THIS.

1486
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:56,992
THAT'S 50.

1487
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:57,952
THAT'S A START.

1488
01:14:57,952 --> 01:15:00,705
ANYBODY ELSE? HUH?

1489
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:10,923
YOU DA MAN.

1490
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:12,758
GIVE ME SOME.

1491
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:14,677
THERE WE GO.

1492
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:16,095
ANYBODY ELSE?

1493
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,888
I'VE GOT 50.

1494
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:22,893
WELL, THIS HAS BEEN
ABOUT AS GOOD AS GOING
TO A MATINEE.

1495
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:24,937
THERE WE GO. THANK
YOU, MR. BOJANGLES.

1496
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:28,524
THIS DEFINITELY
QUALIFIES AS MY
RAINY DAY.

1497
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:29,984
MR. JACK HAD THE
MONEY IN HIS SHOE.

1498
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:32,319
LOOK OUT,
NOW EVERYBODY,
PLEASE, QUICKLY.

1499
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:33,988
THANK YOU, PEOPLE.
COME, CHILDREN.

1500
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:36,031
OH, LOOK AT THESE
HAPPY, GIVING FACES.

1501
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:38,909
COME ON DOWN, COME
HITHER, FEEL THE LOVE.

1502
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:41,829
YES, I'M LIKING THAT.

1503
01:15:41,829 --> 01:15:44,373
SHERIFF, ALL I NEED
IS ONE MORE FAVOR.

1504
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:47,585
I NEED TO GET A RIDE
TO THAT AIRPORT.

1505
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:57,094
WON'T DO YOU ANY GOOD.

1506
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:03,976
WE DIDN'T HOLD THE PLANE.

1507
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:07,188
SO YOU JUST
STRAIGHT UP LIED.

1508
01:16:07,188 --> 01:16:09,315
IT'S IN THE BOOK.

1509
01:16:11,192 --> 01:16:15,070
Announcer: FLIGHT 664
TO CHICAGO NOW BOARDING...

1510
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:16,572
IS THAT YOU?

1511
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,491
YEAH.

1512
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:20,367
HE'S NOT COMING.

1513
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:21,911
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

1514
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:23,662
YEAH, THAT'S OK.

1515
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,080
THANKS, GLORIA.

1516
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:28,042
BYE BYE, BABY.
OH, HERE NOW, DON'T
FORGET YOUR FLOWERS.

1517
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:30,461
HERE YOU GO.
THANKS.

1518
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:31,879
I'LL SEE YOU.

1519
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:33,964
BYE BYE.
BYE.

1520
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:42,348
GRACIAS A TODOS.

1521
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:43,224
I THINK
I OWE YOU ONE.

1522
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:44,600
HEY, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, MAN.

1523
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,102
HEY, I'M REALLY
SORRY ABOUT YOUR
GIRLFRIEND AND ALL.

1524
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:49,897
SHE PROBABLY WOULDN'T
TAKE ME BACK RIGHT
NOW ANYWAY.

1525
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:51,774
THEN SHE'D
BE A FOOL.

1526
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:53,567
YOU THINK?
UM-HMM.

1527
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:56,445
OH, A LITTLE LOVE.
WATCH THIS ONE, WATCH HER.

1528
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,905
SHH.

1529
01:16:57,905 --> 01:16:59,406
OK, IF YOU'RE
EVER IN MEXICO--

1530
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:02,785
WELL, IF YOU'RE EVER
IN CHICAGO ROBBING
A CONVENIENCE STORE,

1531
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:06,413
I HOPE THEY POP
A CAP IN YOUR ASS.

1532
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:09,124
Clarence:
MICHAEL.

1533
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:10,334
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1534
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:14,630
I'VE JUST HAD ONE HELL
OF AN UNLUCKY DAY, MAN.

1535
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:19,510
ONCE UPON A TIME,
THERE WAS A WISE WARRIOR

1536
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:22,304
IN A TRIBE
WHO FOUND A HORSE.

1537
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:26,100
AND EVERYBODY SAID
WHAT A LUCKY MAN HE WAS.

1538
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,102
THEN ONE DAY
THE HORSE THREW HIM
AND HE BROKE HIS LEG

1539
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:33,148
AND EVERYONE SAID
WHAT AN UNLUCKY MAN
HE WAS.

1540
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,776
THEN THERE WAS
A GREAT BATTLE.

1541
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:38,612
ALL THE YOUNG MEN DIED
EXCEPT THE WISE WARRIOR

1542
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:43,659
WHO COULDN'T GO BECAUSE
HE HAD A BROKEN LEG.

1543
01:17:45,953 --> 01:17:47,454
DEEP.

1544
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:50,958
DEEP AS USUAL,
STRANGE AS HELL.

1545
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:52,376
