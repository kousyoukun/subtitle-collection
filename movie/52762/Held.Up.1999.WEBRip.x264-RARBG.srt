00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:36,876
THESE PEOPLE
COULD BE DANGEROUS.

176
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,880
OH, YOU BACK OFF!
I CAN BE DANGEROUS.

177
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,352
HI, I NEED TO GET
TO AN AIRPORT.

178
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,680
WE AREN'T TAKING SIDES.

179
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:43,616
AIRPORT?
COME ON, RAE.

180
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:44,851
AN AIRPORT?
THAT'S CRAZY.

181
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,115
OH, YOU AIN'T SEEN
CRAZY YET, EITHER.

182
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,363
Man on intercom:
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN AIRPORT?

183
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,388
YEAH.

184
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,092
YEAH, ACTUALLY,
HI, I AM.

185
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,964
YEAH, I TOLD YOU ONCE
TO STAY OUT OF OUR BUSINESS.

186
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:56,403
Man on intercom:
LAS VEGAS IS JUST A SHORT
DRIVE AROUND THE CANYON.

187
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,029
OH, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

188
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:58,965
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

189
00:09:58,999 --> 00:09:59,929
AFTER ALL THAT I'VE DONE.

190
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:02,137
TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER
A NICE LITTLE VACATION.

191
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:03,099
AND THIS IS
THE WAY YOU ACT?

192
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,436
YOU CALL THIS
A NICE VACATION?

193
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:08,041
AND NOW WE'RE SPENDING
THE REST OF OUR TIME
DRIVING BACK TO CHICAGO

194
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:10,875
TO LOOK FOR A HOUSE
THAT WE SUDDENLY
CAN'T AFFORD?

195
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:13,151
Man on intercom:
THAT MONEY WAS FOR A HOUSE?

196
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,210
YES!
CAN YOU BELIEVE HIM?

197
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:20,747
AND HE BOUGHT
THIS STUPID PIECE
OF SHIT BATMOBILE.

198
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:23,121
YOU KNOW,
I-I'M OUT OF HERE.

199
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:23,856
THAT'S IT.

200
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:25,891
RAE--IT'S NOT
A BATMOBILE, BRO.

201
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,996
RAE, WHERE YOU GOING?

202
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,258
AWAY FROM YOU.

203
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,026
LOOK, DON'T
MAKE ME CALL OUT
YOUR NAME, GIRL.

204
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,025
I WISH YOU WOULD.

205
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,666
I'LL CALL OUT YOUR NAME.

206
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:36,172
I'M GONNA
CALL OUT YOUR NAME.

207
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:37,103
MMM-HMMM.

208
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,867
I'LL CUSS YOU.

209
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:39,866
GIMMIE THIS BAG!

210
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:41,337
GIMMIE! YOU BETTER!

211
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,144
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE GETTING,

212
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,076
YOU'RE GETTING STRONG.

213
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,078
YOU AIN'T GOTTA TAKE IT
OUT ON THE CAR, EITHER.

214
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:49,854
HEY! DON'T
DISRESPECT ME, WOMAN.

215
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:50,923
HONOR THINE BOYFRIEND,

216
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,251
LIKE IT SAYS
IN THE BIBLE.

217
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:56,755
THERE'S A FLIGHT TO CHICAGO
LEAVING VEGAS AIRPORT
TONIGHT AT 6:00.

218
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,760
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU
WEREN'T TAKING SIDES.

219
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,792
I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WOULD BE SO EASY.

220
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:06,228
Man on intercom:
MICHAEL, SPENDING THAT MONEY
VIOLATED A TRUST, A BOND.

221
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,196
I'M GONNA SNATCH SOME
WIRES OUT YOUR ASS.

222
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,035
Man: WE'RE HEADED
THAT WAY, MA'AM.

223
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,470
AND YOU'RE SURE WELCOME
TO RIDE WITH US.

224
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:15,214
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T MIND RIDING
IN THE BACK WITH THE BOYS.

225
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:18,912
THE BOYS?

226
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,985
OH, MAN.

227
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:26,949
HOWDY.
HI.

228
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:27,857
THEY DON'T
WANT YOU, RAE.

229
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:30,288
THEY GOT SPURS THAT
JINGLE JANGLE JINGLE.

230
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,833
THEY GOT ROPES
AND NO STEERS.

231
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,030
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

232
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:35,261
LOOK, RAE, LISTEN.

233
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,995
LISTEN, COME ON,
NOW BLACK PEOPLE DON'T
DO THIS KIND OF STUFF.

234
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,500
ALL RIGHT,
MOUNTAIN CLIMBING,

235
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,431
GETTING LOST
IN THE FOREST

236
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,796
AND TAKING RIDES WITH
PEOPLE WE DON'T KNOW.

237
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:42,865
WE DON'T DO THAT.

238
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,873
SO LET'S
JUST CHILL, OK?

239
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,005
GOOD-BYE, MICHAEL.

240
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:46,739
I'M LEAVING.

241
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:48,084
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE LEAVING?

242
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,038
I CAN'T DO THIS.

243
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:49,876
YOU CAN'T DO WHAT?

244
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,080
I CAN'T BE WITH
YOU ANYMORE, MICHAEL.

245
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:53,882
YOU ARE
REALLY TRIPPING.

246
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:56,054
OH, NOW YOU'RE GONNA
GIVE THE RING BACK.

247
00:11:56,083 --> 00:12:00,523
OK, COME ON.

248
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,063
WELL, I SPENT A LOT
OF MONEY ON THE RING.

249
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,390
NO, I DIDN'T MEAN IT
LIKE THAT, RAE. LOOK--

250
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:08,164
I MAY NOT BE AN EXPERT,
MICHAEL, BUT WOMEN LIKE
TO FEEL IMPORTANT.

251
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:12,365
IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS,
LIKE SENDING THEM FLOWERS
FOR NO REASON,

252
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,069
OR LEAVING LITTLE NOTES
IN THEIR SOCK DRAWERS.

253
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,943
UNCLE FESTER,
IF YOU DON'T GET UP
OUT OF HERE--

254
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:20,772
OK, LOOK, RAE, YOU DONE
HAD YOUR LITTLE FUN,

255
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:22,878
YOU AND THE
BEVERLY HILLBUDDIES
AND EVERYTHING,

256
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,040
BUT I'M GONNA COUNT TO 3

257
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,947
AND I WANT YOU TO GET
YOUR NARROW TAIL OFF
OF THIS TRUCK.

258
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:29,381
ONE...

259
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:31,017
TWO...

260
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:32,191
I'M AT TWO, RAE.

261
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,049
THIS IS TWO.

262
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,063
OK, WELL, GO ON THEN.

263
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,330
I DON'T NEED YOU.

264
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:39,888
I'M JUST PLAYING, RAE.

265
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,057
RAE, I'M PLAYING.

266
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,064
WHAT ABOUT MY RING?

267
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,166
I'LL FED EX IT TO YOU!

268
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:49,338
AND DON'T TRY TO CALL
MY MAMA'S HOUSE.

269
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,439
GIRL, YOUR MOTHER LOVES ME.

270
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,942
WHAT?

271
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:56,041
I'LL CALL IF I WANT TO.

272
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:02,147
WHAT THE HELL?

273
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:02,722
OH!

274
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,989
Man:
TOUGH BREAK, MAN.

275
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:05,948
HUH?

276
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:08,516
PRETTY STUPID TO LOCK
YOUR KEYS IN LIKE THAT.

277
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,015
WASN'T STUPID, MAN.

278
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:10,957
I WAS JUST IN A HURRY.

279
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:12,891
YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL,
THIS IS A CLASSIC CAR.

280
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,056
DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

281
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,855
I CAN OPEN IT,
YOU KNOW.

282
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:17,867
YOU CAN?

283
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:18,828
50 BUCKS.

284
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,996
50 BUCKS, PARTNER,
WHO YOU TRYING TO FOOL, MAN?

285
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,074
$50 AND I CAN
GET IN HERE MYSELF.

286
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,143
HEY, I HEARD SOME OF
THEM COWBOYS SAY

287
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,971
YOUR GIRLFRIEND
HAD A CUTE BUTT.

288
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,536
IS THAT WHAT THEY SAID?

289
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:28,244
MMM-HMMM.

290
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,605
IT WAS THE TALL ONE,
WASN'T IT?

291
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,142
KICK HIS ASS.

292
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:33,978
LOOK, ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS 50.

293
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:34,854
IT'S ALL I'VE GOT.

294
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:37,992
BUT YOU GET IT AFTER
YOU GET IN HERE, OK?

295
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,388
YOU OPEN IT,
THE MONEY'S YOURS.

296
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,219
LET'S GO.

297
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,864
WELL, I'M GOING
TO NEED A HANGER.

298
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:45,361
I CAN'T DO IT
WITHOUT A HANGER.

299
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:46,492
OK, I'M GOING TO RUN IN
AND GRAB YOU A HANGER

300
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:51,596
AND A WET NAP TO GET YOUR
SLUSH PUPPY-NESS OFF MY RIDE.

301
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:56,439
FOR 50 BUCK, YOU SHOULD
HAVE YOUR OWN HANGER.

302
00:13:57,137 --> 00:14:02,307
Man on intercom:
* BEAUTIFUL DREAMER...

303
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:04,644
YES!

304
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,047
* STARLIGHT A BOO BOO...

305
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:11,121
UH, EXCUSE ME, BING,
DO YOU WORK HERE?

306
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:13,151
NO, I JUST LIKE
WEARING PLAID.

307
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,116
OK, LOOK, I NEED TO GET
A HANGER FROM YOU.

308
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:19,525
AND I NEED $14.75
FOR THE GAS.

309
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,197
LOOK, I'M IN A HURRY,
THIS IS ALL I GOT.

310
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,943
BETTER GET
SOMETHING ELSE THEN.

311
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:37,439
ALL RIGHT, $14.75 FOR THE GAS,
$35.25 FOR A HANGER.

312
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,007
YOU DON'T NEED A HANGER.

313
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:40,106
NO, I DO NEED A HANGER.

314
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:41,917
LOOK, IF YOU WAS IN MY
BUSINESS LIKE YOU WERE EARLIER,

315
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:43,119
YOU'D UNDERSTAND
THE LITTLE MAN OUT THERE

316
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,090
CAN'T GET INTO MY CAR
WITHOUT A HANGER.

317
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,048
YOU WANT TO BET
THAT 50 BUCKS?

318
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:49,057
I WILL DOUBLE DOWN
ON THE 50 BUCKS.

319
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,559
AND THE PLAID SHIRT.

320
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,203
HEY! HEY!
GET OUT OF MY RIDE!

321
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,458
OH, I'M GONNA KICK
YOUR LITTLE ASS!

322
00:14:57,497 --> 00:15:00,127
YOUR LITTLE ASS IS KICKED!

323
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,437
I'M GONNA KICK YOUR ASS!

324
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,010
DAMN!

325
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:12,979
* BEAUTIFUL DREAMER
WAKE UNTO ME *

326
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:17,453
* STARLIGHT AND DREAMLIGHT...

327
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,118
I NEED A PHONE.

328
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:23,123
SHERIFF'S NUMBER'S
ON THE SIDE.

329
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:30,962
I NEED TO GET A QUARTER
FROM YOU, BOSS.

330
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:33,068
[CASH REGISTER DOOR]

331
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,430
I AIN'T GOT NO QUARTERS.

332
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:38,207
WHAT KIND OF A STORE
AIN'T GOT NO QUARTERS?

333
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:39,238
HEY, LOOK HERE,
PARTNER,

00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,542
WHAT DO I GOT TO
DO TO GET A QUARTER
AROUND HERE?

335
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:45,753
I KNOW WHERE YOU CAN
MAKE A QUICK 100 IF YOU
LIKE WEARING TIGHTS.

336
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,418
COME ON, MAN.

337
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,678
I AM IN THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

338
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:53,147
WHAT YOU NEED, OPIE?

339
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,556
ARE YOU PUFF DADDY?

340
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:58,188
DO I LOOK LIKE
PUFF DADDY TO YOU?

341
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:02,225
UM, YOU GOT A QUARTER?

342
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:04,102

01:09:00,904 --> 01:09:02,774
MY FATHER?
UM-HMM.

1367
01:09:02,806 --> 01:09:06,206
GIRL, MY FATHER
IS DEAD.

1368
01:09:06,243 --> 01:09:06,943
HELLO.

1369
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:07,776
Beau: DEPUTY BEAUMONT.

1370
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:09,951
OH, DAD. HEY, DADDY.

1371
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:13,419
GIRL, WHEN YOU SAID
"FATHER", I THOUGHT
YOU MEANT MY PRIEST.

1372
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:15,350
YEAH, MY PRIEST
IS DEAD.

1373
01:09:15,385 --> 01:09:17,745
GOD BLESS HIM.

1374
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:20,789
YEAH.

1375
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:22,834
Beau: I KNOW YOU CAN'T
TALK FREELY IN THERE.

1376
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:27,699
WHEN I ASK
YOU A QUESTION,
I WANT YOU TO SAY,

1377
01:09:27,731 --> 01:09:31,241
"THE WEATHER IS FINE"
IF THE ANSWER'S YES.

1378
01:09:31,268 --> 01:09:36,908
IF THE ANSWER'S NO,
I WANT YOU TO SAY,
"IT LOOKS LIKE RAIN."

1379
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:38,010
YOU UNDERSTAND?

1380
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:41,951
UM-HMM. OH,
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

1381
01:09:41,978 --> 01:09:44,708
THE SUN JUST
POPPED OUT.

1382
01:09:44,748 --> 01:09:46,918
Beau: OK,
HERE'S THE DEAL.

1383
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:50,850
WE WANT YOU TO HELP
US TAKE HIM DOWN.

1384
01:09:50,887 --> 01:09:51,817
YOU WILLING
TO PLAY BALL?

1385
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:57,255
UH, ACTUALLY
IT'S STARTING
TO LOOK LIKE RAIN.

1386
01:09:59,796 --> 01:10:00,826
NOW YOU DO YOUR PART,

1387
01:10:00,864 --> 01:10:05,604
AND WE'LL MAKE
SURE THAT PLANE
STAYS ON THE GROUND.

1388
01:10:05,635 --> 01:10:07,895
WE GOT A DEAL?

1389
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:10,407
THE WEATHER IS NICE.

1390
01:10:13,343 --> 01:10:16,853
Beau: OK, HERE'S
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO.

1391
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,750
YOU GET HIM TO RELEASE
EVERYBODY ELSE.

1392
01:10:19,783 --> 01:10:21,923
AND THEN I WANT YOU
TO WALK OUT THERE WITH HIM.

1393
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,851
NOW, YOU KEEP YOUR
EYES ON THE SHERIFF,

1394
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:25,987
BECAUSE HE'S GOING
TO ASK YOU SWING AWAY.

1395
01:10:26,022 --> 01:10:28,632
HAND ACROSS THE HAT,
THEN ACROSS THE CHEST

1396
01:10:28,658 --> 01:10:31,858
AND THEN WHEN YOU SEE
HIM DO THAT, I WANT
YOU TO HIT THE DIRT.

1397
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:34,425
AND WE'LL TAKE
CARE OF THE REST.

1398
01:10:34,464 --> 01:10:35,534
YOU GOT THAT?

1399
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:39,565
OK. WELL, OK,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
DAD, I'LL HOLLER.

1400
01:10:39,603 --> 01:10:42,913
ALL RIGHT,
OK, BYE BYE.

1401
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:47,481
YEAH, THAT'S MY DAD.

1402
01:10:47,511 --> 01:10:50,751
HE'S AN OLD
RETIRED WEATHERMAN.

1403
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:51,820
OH.

1404
01:10:54,318 --> 01:10:58,758
I WANT YOU TO TAKE
HIM OUT WITH THE FIRST
SHOT, BEAU.

1405
01:10:58,788 --> 01:11:01,058
LET'S GET THOSE
KIDS OUT OF HERE.

1406
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,830
YES, SIR.

1407
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:07,933
WELL, I'LL BE DAMNED.

1408
01:11:12,669 --> 01:11:13,839
Pembry: HELLO IN THERE.

1409
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:14,900
WE GOT THE BUS OUT HERE.

1410
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:20,008
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO LIVE UP
TO YOUR END OF THE DEAL.

1411
01:11:21,545 --> 01:11:22,905
LET'S DO IT.

1412
01:11:24,548 --> 01:11:26,918
LET'S CLEAR THESE
CIVILIANS OUT OF HERE.

1413
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:27,920
YES, SIR.

1414
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:29,691
ALL RIGHT, FOLKS,
I NEED YOU ALL
TO MOVE BACK.

1415
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:30,519
GO.

1416
01:11:30,554 --> 01:11:31,564
Beau: LET'S MOVE
BACK BEHIND THE CARS.

1417
01:11:31,588 --> 01:11:34,688
FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY.
COME ON, MOVE IT,
LET'S GO.

1418
01:11:34,724 --> 01:11:36,864
WHAT'S GOING ON, ELI?

1419
01:11:36,893 --> 01:11:39,863
JUST A
PRECAUTIONARY
MEASURE.

1420
01:11:39,896 --> 01:11:41,926
YOU WANT US TO MOVE?

1421
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:44,965
OH, NO. YOU FINE
RIGHT THERE.

1422
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:55,081
CLARENCE, THAT'S ONE
YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR.

1423
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,080
THIS IS YOURS.

1424
01:11:59,716 --> 01:12:01,016
THANKS.

1425
01:12:06,089 --> 01:12:08,589
Jack: FOR GOD'S SAKE,
SIMMS, GET THAT--

1426
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:11,725
IT'S 116 IN THE SHADE.

1427
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:17,028
Rodrigo: WAIT, WAIT.

1428
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:18,996
NO GUNS.

1429
01:12:23,873 --> 01:12:27,813
Pembry: ALL RIGHT,
LET'S PUT THEM DOWN.

1430
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:31,009
LET'S GO.

1431
01:12:37,654 --> 01:12:38,924
IT'S ALL RIGHT, MARY.

1432
01:12:38,955 --> 01:12:42,755
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

1433
01:12:42,792 --> 01:12:43,662
ARE YOU OK?

1434
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:44,463
NO, SHE'S NOT OK.

1435
01:12:44,494 --> 01:12:46,864
SHE DON'T LIKE BEING
AROUND A KILLER.

1436
01:12:46,896 --> 01:12:47,796
I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

1437
01:12:47,831 --> 01:12:49,971
THEN WHAT ABOUT
THE DEAD BODY IN
THE CRATE.

1438
01:12:49,999 --> 01:12:50,929
WHAT ABOUT THE WHAT?

1439
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:52,067
THE BODY.

1440
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:55,941
THE BODY IN THE CRATE.

1441
01:12:55,972 --> 01:12:57,842
IT'S MY FATHER.

1442
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:01,814
I'M TRYING TO TAKE
HIM BACK TO MEXICO.

1443
01:13:06,683 --> 01:13:09,153
DON'T STOP MOVING,
DON'T STOP MOVING.

1444
01:13:14,924 --> 01:13:18,134
AH!
Rodrigo: MARY!

1445
01:13:18,161 --> 01:13:19,801
DROP YOUR WEAPON!
DROP IT.

1446
01:13:19,829 --> 01:13:20,459
NO, NO, NO, NO.

1447
01:13:20,497 --> 01:13:21,227
DROP THAT GUN
OR I'LL FIRE.

1448
01:13:21,264 --> 01:13:23,904
I JUST WANT TO GO
BACK TO MEXICO.

1449
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:25,943
DROP IT NOW.

1450
01:13:25,969 --> 01:13:26,599
OH, NO. WAIT
A MINUTE, SHERIFF.

1451
01:13:26,636 --> 01:13:28,136
MOVE OUT OF
THE WAY, TYSON.

1452
01:13:28,171 --> 01:13:29,141
SHERIFF, HE'S
NOT A KILLER.

1453
01:13:29,172 --> 01:13:30,172
Pembry: IF YOU
WANT US TO HOLD
THAT DAMN PLANE,

1454
01:13:30,206 --> 01:13:33,876
YOU WILL MOVE
YOUR ASS OUT OF
THE WAY RIGHT NOW.

1455
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:35,950
WHAT'S GOING
ON, MICHAEL?

1456
01:13:35,979 --> 01:13:38,479
MAN, THEY TRIED TO GET
ME TO SET YOU UP.

1457
01:13:38,515 --> 01:13:40,815
YOU DID A PRETTY
GOOD JOB.

1458
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:44,851
LEAVE HIM ALONE.

1459
01:13:46,556 --> 01:13:47,556
AW, HELL.

1460
01:13:47,591 --> 01:13:49,661
MARY, YOU DROP THAT WEAPON
AND BACK AWAY FROM HIM.

1461
01:13:49,693 --> 01:13:50,833
HE'S GOT A DEAD
BODY IN THERE.

1462
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:57,000
I KNOW. IT'S HIS
FATHER AND HE'S TRYING
TO TAKE HIM HOME.

1463
01:13:57,033 --> 01:14:00,773
WELL, THAT DON'T
SEEM TO MAKE A BIG
DIFFERENCE.

1464
01:14:00,804 --> 01:14:01,744
HE'S UNDER
ARREST ANYWAY.

1465
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:02,911
Michael: AW,
COME ON SHERIFF.
FOR WHAT CHARGE?

1466
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:06,739
WELL, FOR ATTEMPTED
MURDER FOR THAT SHOT
HE TOOK AT YOU.

1467
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:09,476
ATTEMPT--WELL, LOOK,
IF YOU CHARGE HIM WITH
ATTEMPTED MURDER,

1468
01:14:09,513 --> 01:14:12,123
THEN YOU GOT TO CHARGE HIM
WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER, TOO,

1469
01:14:12,148 --> 01:14:15,248
WITH HIS BARNEY FIFE ASS.

1470
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:18,724
ALL RIGHT, MEN, PUT
AWAY YOUR WEAPONS.

1471
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:30,674
WHAT IS IT
YOU WANT, TYSON?

1472
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:31,640
I WANT WHAT YOU PROMISED.

1473
01:14:31,668 --> 01:14:33,598
FIRST OF ALL, I NEED
TO GET THIS DUDE TO MEXICO

1474
01:14:33,637 --> 01:14:35,567
SO HE CAN TAKE CARE
OF HIS FATHER.

1475
01:14:35,605 --> 01:14:36,865
WE CAN'T DO THAT.

1476
01:14:36,906 --> 01:14:38,536
WE DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH MONEY.

1477
01:14:38,575 --> 01:14:39,975
WHAT? YOU DON'T
HAVE ENOUGH MONEY?

1478
01:14:40,009 --> 01:14:41,009
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

1479
01:14:41,044 --> 01:14:43,014
LOOK AT ALL THESE
TAXPAYING CITIZENS
AROUND HERE.

1480
01:14:43,046 --> 01:14:44,106
YOU GOT SOME
MONEY IN HERE

1481
01:14:44,147 --> 01:14:46,877
COME ON, DON'T
BULLSHIT ME.

1482
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:47,916
TOWN'S BROKE.

1483
01:14:47,951 --> 01:14:50,821
Man: WE ARE NOT.

1484
01:14:52,756 --> 01:14:54,516
Michael: 50.

1485
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:56,831
OH, COME ON, TYSON,
DON'T DO THIS.

1486
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:57,930
THAT'S 50.

1487
01:14:57,961 --> 01:14:58,901
THAT'S A START.

1488
01:14:58,928 --> 01:15:01,728
ANYBODY ELSE? HUH?

1489
01:15:10,874 --> 01:15:11,884
YOU DA MAN.

1490
01:15:11,908 --> 01:15:13,738
GIVE ME SOME.

1491
01:15:13,777 --> 01:15:15,677
THERE WE GO.

1492
01:15:15,712 --> 01:15:17,012
ANYBODY ELSE?

1493
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:18,846
I'VE GOT 50.

1494
01:15:18,882 --> 01:15:23,852
WELL, THIS HAS BEEN
ABOUT AS GOOD AS GOING
TO A MATINEE.

1495
01:15:23,887 --> 01:15:25,887
THERE WE GO. THANK
YOU, MR. BOJANGLES.

1496
01:15:25,922 --> 01:15:29,562
THIS DEFINITELY
QUALIFIES AS MY
RAINY DAY.

1497
01:15:29,593 --> 01:15:30,933
MR. JACK HAD THE
MONEY IN HIS SHOE.

1498
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,200
LOOK OUT,
NOW EVERYBODY,
PLEASE, QUICKLY.

1499
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:34,929
THANK YOU, PEOPLE.
COME, CHILDREN.

1500
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:36,974
OH, LOOK AT THESE
HAPPY, GIVING FACES.

1501
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,870
COME ON DOWN, COME
HITHER, FEEL THE LOVE.

1502
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:42,813
YES, I'M LIKING THAT.

1503
01:15:42,839 --> 01:15:45,239
SHERIFF, ALL I NEED
IS ONE MORE FAVOR.

1504
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:48,654
I NEED TO GET A RIDE
TO THAT AIRPORT.

1505
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:58,045
WON'T DO YOU ANY GOOD.

1506
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:04,931
WE DIDN'T HOLD THE PLANE.

1507
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:08,101
SO YOU JUST
STRAIGHT UP LIED.

1508
01:16:08,131 --> 01:16:10,231
IT'S IN THE BOOK.

1509
01:16:12,135 --> 01:16:16,005
Announcer: FLIGHT 664
TO CHICAGO NOW BOARDING...

1510
01:16:16,039 --> 01:16:17,609
IS THAT YOU?

1511
01:16:17,641 --> 01:16:19,341
YEAH.

1512
01:16:19,375 --> 01:16:21,235
HE'S NOT COMING.

1513
01:16:21,277 --> 01:16:22,877
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

1514
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,682
YEAH, THAT'S OK.

1515
01:16:24,714 --> 01:16:25,824
THANKS, GLORIA.

1516
01:16:25,849 --> 01:16:28,989
BYE BYE, BABY.
OH, HERE NOW, DON'T
FORGET YOUR FLOWERS.

1517
01:16:29,018 --> 01:16:31,318
HERE YOU GO.
THANKS.

1518
01:16:31,354 --> 01:16:32,864
I'LL SEE YOU.

1519
01:16:32,889 --> 01:16:34,959
BYE BYE.

1520
01:16:41,164 --> 01:16:43,234
GRACIAS A TODOS.

1521
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:43,926
I THINK
I OWE YOU ONE.

1522
01:16:43,967 --> 01:16:45,027
HEY, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, MAN.

1523
01:16:45,068 --> 01:16:48,038
HEY, I'M REALLY
SORRY ABOUT YOUR
GIRLFRIEND AND ALL.

1524
01:16:48,071 --> 01:16:50,871
SHE PROBABLY WOULDN'T
TAKE ME BACK RIGHT
NOW ANYWAY.

1525
01:16:50,907 --> 01:16:52,777
THEN SHE'D
BE A FOOL.

1526
01:16:52,809 --> 01:16:54,409
YOU THINK?
UM-HMM.

1527
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:57,313
OH, A LITTLE LOVE.
WATCH THIS ONE, WATCH HER.

1528
01:16:57,346 --> 01:16:58,876
SHH.

1529
01:16:58,915 --> 01:17:00,075
OK, IF YOU'RE
EVER IN MEXICO--

1530
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:03,786
WELL, IF YOU'RE EVER
IN CHICAGO ROBBING
A CONVENIENCE STORE,

1531
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:07,290
I HOPE THEY POP
A CAP IN YOUR ASS.

1532
01:17:07,323 --> 01:17:10,063
Clarence:
MICHAEL.

1533
01:17:10,093 --> 01:17:11,033
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1534
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:15,700
I'VE JUST HAD ONE HELL
OF AN UNLUCKY DAY, MAN.

1535
01:17:17,801 --> 01:17:20,371
ONCE UPON A TIME,
THERE WAS A WISE WARRIOR

1536
01:17:20,403 --> 01:17:23,213
IN A TRIBE
WHO FOUND A HORSE.

1537
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:27,039
AND EVERYBODY SAID
WHAT A LUCKY MAN HE WAS.

1538
01:17:27,076 --> 01:17:29,046
THEN ONE DAY
THE HORSE THREW HIM
AND HE BROKE HIS LEG

1539
01:17:29,078 --> 01:17:34,078
AND EVERYONE SAID
WHAT AN UNLUCKY MAN
HE WAS.

1540
01:17:34,117 --> 01:17:36,787
THEN THERE WAS
A GREAT BATTLE.

1541
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:39,460
ALL THE YOUNG MEN DIED
EXCEPT THE WISE WARRIOR

1542
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:44,728
WHO COULDN'T GO BECAUSE
HE HAD A BROKEN LEG.

1543
01:17:46,963 --> 01:17:48,333
DEEP.

1544
01:17:48,364 --> 01:17:51,944
DEEP AS USUAL,
STRANGE AS HELL.

1545
01:17:51,968 --> 01:17:53,298
BUT DEEP.

1546
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:56,140
GET ON OUT OF HERE, MAN.

1547
01:18:01,144 --> 01:18:03,254
HEY, MICHAEL.
YEAH.

1548
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:07,149
DID I MENTION
I KNEW A GIRL IN
TOPOLOBAMPO ONCE?

1549
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:09,323
YEE-HAW!

1550
01:18:36,946 --> 01:18:39,846
SORRY ABOUT
YOUR STORE, JACK.

1551
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:43,150
THANKS, MICHAEL.

1552
01:18:55,298 --> 01:18:57,028
PLEASE COME AGAIN.

1553
01:18:58,935 --> 01:19:00,835
HEY--I...

1554
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:08,439
Michael: HEY, WAIT UP!

1555
01:19:35,071 --> 01:19:37,071
Jack: THAT'S JOSE'S PLANE.

1556
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:39,476
ALL RIGHT!

1557
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:44,848
HEY, MICHAEL, THIS MAY BE
YOUR LUCKY DAY AFTER ALL.

1558
01:19:44,881 --> 01:19:48,021
Michael: MAYBE I CAN
MAKE IT STILL.

1559
01:19:57,426 --> 01:19:58,286
WOW.

1560
01:19:58,327 --> 01:20:00,827
Michael: GRAPEFRUIT
LADY, YOU'RE MY RIDE.

1561
01:20:00,864 --> 01:20:01,534
WE ONLY GOT 10 MINUTES.

1562
01:20:01,564 --> 01:20:03,274
YEAH, WE CAN
STILL MAKE IT.

1563
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:04,269
ARE YOU SURE?

1564
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,270
YEAH. IT'S JUST
A SHORT FLIGHT
OVER THE CANYON.

1565
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:08,872
A CONDOM WITH GLASSES.
ALL RIGHT.

1566
01:20:08,905 --> 01:20:11,975
WAIT. YOU GOT
THE 35 BUCKS?

1567
01:20:12,008 --> 01:20:14,038
AT LEAST "HALF-AY".

1568
01:20:14,077 --> 01:20:15,007
35. COME ON, PLEASE.

1569
01:20:15,044 --> 01:20:18,054
THIS CANNOT BE
HAPPENING TO ME.

1570
01:20:23,019 --> 01:20:25,919
CONSIDER THAT
A LOAN, TYSON.

1571
01:20:28,992 --> 01:20:30,632
HAVE A NICE TRIP.

1572
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,999
THANKS, MAN.

1573
01:20:33,029 --> 01:20:35,059
I'M A LITTLE SENSITIVE
ABOUT MY MONEY.

1574
01:20:35,098 --> 01:20:36,098
SI, SI.

1575
01:20:36,132 --> 01:20:37,932
GET ME THERE.

1576
01:20:42,939 --> 01:20:44,539
Michael: DAMN!

1577
01:20:46,475 --> 01:20:49,045
HOW LONG YOU'VE
HAD YOUR LICENSE?

1578
01:20:49,078 --> 01:20:52,548
Pilot: WHAT IS THIS
LICENSE? [LAUGHS]

1579
01:20:53,983 --> 01:20:56,993
IT'S KIND OF SHAKY, HUH?

1580
01:21:03,526 --> 01:21:06,556
AH, THIS IS OK.
GO, WE NEED TO GO!

1581
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:10,165
Â¡AMORES ADELANTE!

1582
01:21:13,937 --> 01:21:20,007
Announcer: THIS IS
THE DEPARTURE OF ALTA AIR
FLIGHT 664 TO CHICAGO

1583
01:21:20,043 --> 01:21:21,543
IS READY FOR FINAL BOARDING.

1584
01:21:21,577 --> 01:21:26,477
ALL CONFIRMED PASSENGERS SHOULD
BE ON BOARD THE AIRCRAFT.

1585
01:21:39,462 --> 01:21:42,902
HEY! THAT'S MY CAR.

1586
01:21:46,102 --> 01:21:50,042
WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY RIDE?

1587
01:21:50,073 --> 01:21:52,943
KEEP IT, YOU LITTLE ASSHOLE.

1588
01:21:56,045 --> 01:21:58,975
Woman: DID YOU SEE
THE EXCITEMENT ON
THE TV TODAY?

1589
01:21:59,015 --> 01:22:01,445
IT WAS LIKE COPS
WITHOUT THE COMMERCIALS.

1590
01:22:01,484 --> 01:22:02,224
YOU'RE NOT KIDDING.

1591
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:03,621
EARL AND I WERE
GLUED TO THE SET.

1592
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:08,022
WHEN THEY CAME OUT OF
THERE IN THEIR UNDERWEAR,
I HAD TO TAKE A PILL.

1593
01:22:08,057 --> 01:22:10,057
BUT HOW THEY COULD
MISTAKE THAT SKINNY GUY

1594
01:22:10,093 --> 01:22:13,063
FOR MIKE TYSON,
I'LL NEVER KNOW.

1595
01:22:23,339 --> 01:22:27,509
Pilot: YOU GIVE ME THE OTHER
HALF RIGHT NOW, OK?

1596
01:22:27,543 --> 01:22:28,713
OK?

1597
01:22:28,744 --> 01:22:30,014
Michael: AARGH!

1598
01:22:30,046 --> 01:22:33,316
RAE! RAE!

1599
01:22:33,349 --> 01:22:34,249

DON'T MAKE ME GO
FOR THE DING-A-LING.
