Oh, Jack. That's a new one to me.

Imagine every cell being rinsed clean
with life-giving oxygen.

508
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,096
Do you have any clues
where the origin of this phobia lies?

509
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,507
I've had it all my life.

510
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:19,144
I've tried to get on top of it.

511
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,347
I went to a washhouse
when I was at college,

512
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,437
but I was just so terrified,

513
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,897
I accidentally trapped my load
in an OOO.

<i>Yes. An out of order machine.</i>

516
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,497
I was in there with about six months'
of unimaginably sensitive material.

517
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:41,124
The room gathered round,
engineers were called.

518
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,077
- It was a nightmare.
- No. I sympathize with you.

519
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,788
As unpleasant as the experience
may have been

520
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:50,796
it cannot have been traumatic enough
to create such a phobia.

You're an orphan?
I'm sorry, I didn't...

547
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,856
My mother abandoned me
when I was 5 years old.

548
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:36,527
She just packed
a little suitcase for me one day

549
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,488
and disappeared.

550
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,488
How did it happen, Jack?

551
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:48,627
- It's all right to feel vulnerable.
- These pyjamas aren't helping.

552
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,462
Try, Jack.

553
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,965
Try to go back.

554
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:59,508
The only memory I have of my mother
is of a book she gave me.

555
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:04,468
Fairy tales I suppose you call them.
With these awful talking rodents.

556

Look, truth is it doesn't bother me.

557
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,056
I don't miss my mother
because I don't remember her.

558
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:14,236
I just...
I'm sick of these irrational fears.

559
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:17,898
Like the bloody launderette.
It's stopping me from living my life.

560
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:22,444
Well, you can do something about it.
You're not a child anymore.

561
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:25,656
I once treated a girl
who had a phobia of bananas.

562
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:29,455
When this girl came to me,
she was so pleased with herself.

563
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,832
She'd been able
to overcome her phobia

564
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:36,000
to the extent that she could sit
in the same room as a closed banana.

565
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:40,671
It had to stay closed, unzipped, or
else she'd go completely psychotic.

566
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:44,387
But the point is, open or closed,
she had not made the connection

567
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,639
between her phobia and her fear.

568
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:50,556
- Of bananas?
- No. It was something else.

569
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:54,017
A past trauma. Something more
threatening than a mere banana.

570
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,523
Do you understand?
It's like a movie screen.

571
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,322
She projected her fear
onto the banana

572
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,901
because looking directly
at her trauma was too terrifying.

573
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,611
It was a projection.

574
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,538
- Onto a piece of fruit?
- Exactly.

575
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,868
Her banana's no different
to your launderette.

576
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,585
I also have a recurring nightmare
about an eyeball.

577
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,386
- What sort of eyeball?
- The giant, floating kind.

578
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,635
Sort of eye of death, watching me.

579
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,810
All fears and neurosis can be traced
back to our early childhood.

580
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:34,642
To the first terrifying recognition
that we are alone in the world.

581
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,773
When a child is abandoned,
it has no concept of time.

582
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,321
No understanding
that things can get better.

583
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:45,778
That there is hope. For a child,
Jack, mother equals life.

584
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,487
Take away the mother

585
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:52,292
and the child is literally
swallowed by death.

586
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,629
But I didn't die, did I?

587
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:59,462
No. You lived.

588
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:02,260
To experience your own death.

589
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,559
That's some scary shit, Dr. Friedkin.

590
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:13,138
It's the primal trauma
we are all trying to forget.

591
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,890
To bury in our subconscious.

592
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:20,900
But it inevitably finds expression
either in dreams or fears

593
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:23,527
- or infantile fantasies.

I don't know how to thank you,
Dr. Friedkin.

597
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:42,213
Perhaps as a teenager, you were
subliminally drawn to that OOO,

598
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:45,094
because somewhere deep
in your subconscious,

599
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:48,013
you recognised
that you, too, are out of order.

600
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,216
Broken. You don't work anymore.

you relied on

to get you through childhood
no longer support you as an adult.

603
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,524
I'm sorry.

604
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,652
You're fucked up, Jack.
You need therapy.

You see, this launderette
used to belong to my grandmother.

That is, before the whole

Broke her heart. Killed her.

01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:19,247
So I'm on a rampage,

Hey, stop it.

1067
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:36,700
You mustn't lose hope.

1068
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:39,956
There's no hope. We're dead.

1069
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:42,255
There is always hope.

1070
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:46,130
I was abandoned in a launderette
as a child.

1071
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:51,927
I couldn't speak for six weeks,
I was so afraid.

1072
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:54,433
I've come full circle.

1073
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:56,594
I'm alive,

1074
01:15:56,761 --> 01:16:00,891
alive to experience my own death.

1075
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:02,816
It's destiny.

1076
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:06,278
No!

Listen, your mother, she gave up
on herself, not on you.

1080
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:50,698
You don't make the same mistake.

1081
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:53,234
We can do it together.

1082
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:59,290
Come on, we have to try
and reason with him.

1083
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,667
There's always hope.

1084
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:08,374
I don't even know your name.

1085
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:11,886
Sangeet. My name is Sangeet.

1086
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:14,467
Sangeet.

1087
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,008
That's a very beautiful name.

1088
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:22,180
Sangeet, do you think
if all this blows over,

1089
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:26,647
you and I might perhaps
get some dinner or...?

1090
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:29,812
That's the spirit, John.

01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:29,797
What's wrong? Not your cup of tea?

1100
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:35,128
But how can you not like this?

1101
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:39,344
This is top-notch.
This is classic rock.

1102
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:42,180
Er, no.

1103
01:18:42,343 --> 01:18:45,813
Technically, this is '80s hair metal.

1104
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:47,518
What?

1105
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:52,148
Right.

1106
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:55,732
I'll have you know that
that track was number one

1107
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:58,822
in 25 separate countries in 1986. 25.

1108
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:03,865
Now, I think that qualifies it as
an all-time rock classic. Don't you?

1109
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:07,077
Yeah. Well, we had
different childhoods, mate.

1110
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:10,588
While you were jumping around
in your bedroom to men in tights,

1111
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,589
I was keeping it fresh,

1112
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:15,092
rolling with the brothers,
you know what I'm saying, y'all?

1113
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:18,762
- Dusting off my AK, motherfucker.
- Well, you missed out.

1114
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:24,177
You don't know
what you're talking about anyway.

1115
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:33,440
I used to lie over there, on my bed
with my headphones on.

1116
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:36,523
And I'd just disappear
into my imagination.

1117
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:39,609
Gran always said
I had a very vivid imagination.

1118
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,777
Oh, I could be anyone.

1119
01:19:41,944 --> 01:19:47,792
Sometimes I'd be this rock star,
half man, half elf,

1120
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:52,126
with this great mane of golden hair,
down to my waist

1121
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:54,377
and all the girls would be yelling,

1122
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:59,838
"Oh, Tony. Let me touch it, Tony.
Let me touch it. Let me touch it."

1123
01:20:00,004 --> 01:20:02,382
This was your bedroom?

1124
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:05,051
- Eh?
- You had a bed down here?

1125
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:07,682
Oh, mate.

1126
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:11,140
Me and this launderette go way back.

<i>there wasn't enough room</i>

1132

<i>for two people upstairs in the flat.</i>

1133
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:34,629
<i>So she made me a room down here.</i>

1134
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,832
<i>Down in the cellar.</i>

1135

<i>It was, well...</i>

1136
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,718
<i>It took a bit of getting used to.</i>

1137
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:47,176
<i>But she only locked the hatch</i>
<i>very late at night.</i>

1138

Oh, Tony, you poor thing.

What do you mean? Poor thing?

1143
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:08,706
You were abandoned, Tone.

1144
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:13,210
Mate, I had this whole
massive bedroom to myself.

1145
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:15,708
This is a cellar, Tone. A cellar.

1146

- But...
- Look, it's Dickensian.

- How big was your fucking bedroom?
- That's not the point.

keeps a child in a cellar?

Hey, don't you say a word
about my gran.

1150
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:31,061
My gran was a very special person.

1151

That's the kid talking.

1152

Any mother, even a twisted hag bitch
of a mother is better than no mother.

1153
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:41,781
Come on, Tone. You were dumped.
Alone. In a cellar.

Yeah, all right, thank you very much,

I'm the one feeding the press.
Baffling the police.

I'm conducting the whole thing

I'm like the André Previn
of serial killers.

Mate, I have studied serial killers
and you are not it.

1160

- A serial killer is an artist.
- Hey, I'm all about elegant design.

Tell them, Gran.
I am an artist, aren't I?

1162
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:12,679

there was a hedgehog...

whose name...

1219
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:44,022
was Brian.

1220
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:54,403

<i>deep in the forest,</i>

1221
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:59,117

<i>called the Wyrd Wild Wood.</i>

1222
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:06,087

<i>with howls and screams.</i>

1223
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:09,290
<i>And sometimes it seemed to Brian</i>
<i>as if even the moon</i>

1224
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:11,967
<i>conspired against him.</i>

1225
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:17,465
<i>But the more afraid Brian became,</i>
<i>the angrier he got,</i>

1226
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:21,556
<i>until one night,</i>
<i>frightened out of his wits...</i>

1227
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:26,937
<i>he turned himself</i>
<i>into a terrifying monster.</i>

1228
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:30,902
<i>He put on weight, painted his face</i>

1229
01:26:31,061 --> 01:26:36,158
<i>and started insisting on being</i>
<i>addressed as Balthazar the Berserker.</i>

1230
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:38,910
<i>But then a strange thing happened.</i>

1231
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:41,822
<i>Brian received an unexpected visitor.</i>

<i>"Come any closer</i>
<i>and I'll scratch your eyes out."</i>

1233
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:49,079
<i>He snarled angrily</i>
<i>at the ﬂickering eyes in the trees.</i>

1236
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:56,299
<i>"Who the fuck are you calling Brian?"</i>
<i>said Brian,</i>

1237
01:26:56,461 --> 01:27:00,637
<i>as menacingly as he could manage.</i>
<i>"Why, Brian, it is you."</i>

1238
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:04,724
<i>It was Harold, his brother,</i>
<i>last seen by the road,</i>
