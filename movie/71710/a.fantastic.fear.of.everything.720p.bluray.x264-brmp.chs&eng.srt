It's Humphries or bust.

- I understand.  - Good.

254
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,749
�������ݷù��׶�ÿһ�ҳ������ͷ��
I had sat in every head of scripts department in London,

255
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:16,089
����Щ�Ա������˵ı����ǽ���
listening to these twats full of white wine and arugula,

256
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,300

but I had never heard of this man.

"Harvey Humphries of Humbolt Mews."

258
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:24,219
�Ҳ�ϲ���������
I didn't like the sound of it.

259
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:28,435
������ֿ����������� ����ȴ�̶ܴ�
The name seemed innocent enough, but there was something that jarred.

260
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:32,394
������"�鱤�ֵĹ�ά��������˹"���Ҹо���ˬ��
It might be the "Harvey Humphries Humbolt" bit that was worrying me.

But I had a friend, Garry Gordon in Garrick Street.

262
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,565

And he'd never caused me any problem.

No.

264
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,949

It was something stronger than just a repetition of the H.

265
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:46,207
�о������Ǵ�һ���������õĽǶ�
It was more a sensation of having heard Harvey Humphries

266
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:50,037
������ά��������˹������
in some unsavory context.

Harvey.

00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,092

It was the Harvey.

269
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,640
��ά�ǻ�������ά������ƽҽ�����м���
Harvey was the middle name of Dr. Hawley Harvey Crippen,

00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,567
�Ǹ�ס��N5�� ����ϣ�������մ��39��
the Yank Who'd spent all night in the basement

of 39 Hilldrop Crescent, N5 separating his wife.

He'd done her in lime.

273
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,736

Crippen had come from America.

274
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,447

Humphries was going to America within hours

of completing his business with me.

276
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,253

Was Humphries related to Crippen?

277
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:36,503

Far-fetched as it might seem to others, it was not impossible.

278
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:39,176

Crippen was an American. Yes.

279
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,753

And so was Humphries.

280
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:44,591
һ������ȥ�������˻ᱻ����ǽ���"�������"����Ŀ������
Surely it was more than a coincidence that a man going to America

281
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,722
��һ�п϶��������Ǹ��ɺ�

No.

She'd been able to overcome her phobia

because looking directly at her trauma was too terrifying.

It was a projection.

Take away the mother

With that he chased him into the trees and over the dells, screaming,
