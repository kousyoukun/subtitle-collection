1
00:02:10,762 --> 00:02:12,161
Come. Quick!

2
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:18,669
Louis Alphonse Donatien,
the Marquis de Sade?

3
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:20,204
Dismount, sir.

4
00:02:20,272 --> 00:02:21,762
Dismount, sir, or we fire!

5
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:24,033
Fire!

6
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:01,040
You.

7
00:07:01,886 --> 00:07:02,875
Fellow.

8
00:07:07,258 --> 00:07:09,089
Stop when I speak to you.

9
00:08:19,497 --> 00:08:20,896
Ah, Louis.

10
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:22,364
You're here.

11
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,189
Good.

12
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,059
Uncle?

13
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:29,636
None else, Nephew.

14
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:35,276
Escaped again, have you?

15
00:08:35,346 --> 00:08:38,042
Yes, I hope so.

16
00:08:38,316 --> 00:08:39,681
Clever lad!

17
00:08:40,718 --> 00:08:44,210
What are you doing in here, Uncle?

18
00:08:44,722 --> 00:08:46,622
Waiting for you, Nephew.

19
00:08:47,425 --> 00:08:51,122
For me? But you couldn't possibly
have known I was coming tonight.

20
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:54,859
I hoped.

21
00:08:58,203 --> 00:09:01,900
Who was that old man I saw in the corridor
just a few moments ago?

22
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:04,105
A servant.

23
00:09:06,277 --> 00:09:09,405
I don't recall having seen him before.

24
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:12,081
Well, you know how...

25
00:09:12,183 --> 00:09:14,481
...servants come and go.

26
00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:16,184
I'll discharge him.

27
00:09:16,254 --> 00:09:17,687
Do that, Nephew.

28
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:20,324
But, for now, we're about to start.

29
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:22,257
Start what?

30
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,185
A play! Entertainment!

31
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:28,357
Diversion! Pleasure!

32
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:31,160
Which you so uniquely enjoy.

33
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:37,004
I doubt there'll be time for that.

34
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:39,043
Of course you have time.

35
00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:42,910
When did you ever not have time
for pleasure?

36
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,745
Perhaps a moment then, Uncle.

37
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:52,012
We know your weakness, eh, Nephew?

38
00:09:56,094 --> 00:09:59,291
Well, not much of an audience
for your play, Uncle.

39
00:09:59,564 --> 00:10:01,964
All the audience we need, Nephew.

40
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:26,585
Scene: The Montreuil Estate, outside Paris.

41
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:30,422
Characters:
The Count and Countess de Sade...

42
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:32,823
...your worshipped parents.

43
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:40,729
And <i>Monsieur</i> and <i>Madame</i> De Montreuil...

44
00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:43,738
...your benevolent parents-in-law to be.

45
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:47,107
Occasion: The arrangement
of a marriage contract...

46
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:49,746
...between the Marquis de Sade...

47
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:53,009
...and their daughter,
Lady Renée de Montreuil.

48
00:10:53,484 --> 00:10:56,681
"But first we must set the record right,
as it were!"

49
00:10:56,754 --> 00:10:58,449
- "Silence!"
- "My dear."

50
00:10:58,523 --> 00:11:00,991
- "We will not haggle."
- "No, we will not haggle."

51
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:02,526
"We never haggle!"

52
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:05,960
"We will board the young couple
for the first three years of their..."

53
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,588
- "Seven years!"
- "Four years."

54
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:09,565
- "Six."
- "Five years."

55
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:11,763
- "Five years."
- "Five years."

56
00:11:12,036 --> 00:11:13,833
"And a living allowance."

57
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:17,136
"Of say, 1,000 per annum."

58
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:18,707
- "5,000."
- "2..."

59
00:11:18,776 --> 00:11:20,300
"3,000 crowns."

60
00:11:20,378 --> 00:11:21,743
- "Pounds."
- "Pounds?"

61
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:23,144
"Very well, then.

62
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:24,613
"L3,000."

63
00:11:25,016 --> 00:11:28,452
"For our own part, then,
we will dress the bride...

64
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:32,956
"...and the bridegroom and their party
and provide a two...

65
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:35,185
"Let's say a four-horse carriage...

66
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,252
"...if I have to mortgage the remainder
of your properties to do so...

67
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,096
"...for thus will I ally our families
to the Montreuil fortune."

68
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:45,761
"But first we must set the record right,
as it were.

69
00:11:45,837 --> 00:11:50,774
"Is it not, in fact, true that your son,
the Marquis, is unmarried because of...

70
00:11:50,842 --> 00:11:52,810
- "...his unsavory rep..."
- "I never!"

71
00:11:53,144 --> 00:11:56,307
"Unsavory reputation! It is well known..."

72
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:58,778
- "Silence!"
- "My love."

73
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:02,875
"We are prepared to overlook
our prospective son-in-law's...

74
00:12:02,954 --> 00:12:04,353
"...youthful peccadilloes."

75
00:12:04,422 --> 00:12:05,616
One moment.

76
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:11,754
"I am prepared to overlook anything
to buy my family such a royal connection."

77
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:13,190
- "We, in turn..."
- Stop!

78
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:15,824
"...will add to our end of the dowry
the jewelry...

79
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,060
"...in my wife's collection.

80
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:19,296
- "Never!"
- "Yes, my dear."

81
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,066
"No, never! No, you can't do that!"

82
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,266
This is ludicrous!

83
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:24,899
"My dear!"

84
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:29,372
Stop it!

85
00:12:32,517 --> 00:12:34,485
I said, "Stop it!"

86
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:38,521
This is ludicrous!

87
00:12:39,957 --> 00:12:44,690
The actual negotiations
were nothing like this farce.

88
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:02,875
- They're prepared to see you shortly, sir.
- What?

89
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:06,383
<i>Madame</i> de Montreuil said
that they would see you shortly, sir.

90
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:08,078
If you will wait.

91
00:13:44,922 --> 00:13:48,653
<i>"I sit and I wait here</i>

92
00:13:48,726 --> 00:13:51,627
<i>"By day and by night</i>

93
00:13:51,696 --> 00:13:56,690
<i>"Where is he, when will he ever come?</i>

94
00:13:58,102 --> 00:14:01,902
<i>"I sigh to the sunbeam</i>

95
00:14:01,973 --> 00:14:04,635
<i>"And moonlight</i>

96
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:09,703
<i>"Where is he, when will he ever come?</i>

97
00:14:10,982 --> 00:14:14,008
<i>"I have waited so by truth now</i>

98
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:17,145
<i>"My true love should come</i>

99
00:14:17,221 --> 00:14:22,124
<i>"Where is he, when will he ever come?</i>

100
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:26,858
<i>"Through the waiting, someday</i>

101
00:14:26,931 --> 00:14:29,866
<i>"He surely will come</i>

102
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:34,928
<i>"Where is he, when will he ever come?"</i>

103
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:47,543
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

104
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:03,631
My son.

105
00:15:03,868 --> 00:15:06,496
Good. You've arrived just in time.

106
00:15:06,804 --> 00:15:09,272
<i>Monsieur,</i> we're ready to sign the contract.

107
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,275
You haven't met <i>Monsieur</i> Marais,
our prefect of Police.

108
00:15:12,777 --> 00:15:16,611
Who has kindly consented
to act as a witness to the signatures.

109
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:19,011
- <i>Monsieur.</i>
- My Lord.

110
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:26,582
Well, I'm ready.

111
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,589
And we are ready, too, <i>monsieur.</i>

112
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:08,122
What's the matter, my Son?

113
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:09,625
Where is she?

114
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:12,260
I beg your pardon?

115
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:15,497
Your daughter, the one I mean to marry.

116
00:16:17,108 --> 00:16:18,507
This is she.

117
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:22,670
But this isn't...

118
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:27,242
Have you no other daughter?

119
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,411
<i>Madame,</i> have you no other daughter?

120
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,551
My daughter Anne is not involved.

121
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:40,353
But you don't understand.
This is not the one. This is not she.

122
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:46,395
<i>Monsieur,</i> the contract was signed
between yourself and the Lady Renée...

123
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,698
...who loves you dearly.

124
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:49,706
- It must be torn up and redone.
- Outrageous!

125
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:50,934
Are you mad?

126
00:16:51,008 --> 00:16:54,444
<i>Monsieur,</i> your son has signed
a binding contract.

127
00:16:56,547 --> 00:16:58,139
No, <i>madame,</i> it is not.

128
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:02,945
I warn you, my Son, you have no choice.

129
00:17:05,122 --> 00:17:07,522
You must do as you are told, Son.

130
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,433
<i>Madame,</i> it's impossible...

131
00:17:21,505 --> 00:17:22,494
No!

132
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:40,988
"My dear Son...

133
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,693
"I beg that you reconsider and
return immediately by the post chaise...

134
00:17:45,763 --> 00:17:48,527
"...that I have hired for your return trip.

135
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,803
"I have requested your uncle, the Abbé,
to write to <i>Madame</i> de Montreuil...

136
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:57,999
"...stating that you left for Avignon
to prepare a house for your bride to be...

137
00:17:58,075 --> 00:18:01,875
"...but unfortunately,
you have been delayed there by illness.

138
00:18:02,446 --> 00:18:04,573
- "I've assured <i>Madame..."</i>
- Never mind the letter!

139
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:06,673
"I have assured <i>Madame...</i>

140
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:10,318
"...that you are in bed
with a serious attack of fever."

141
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:12,848
What a fever to be in bed with.

142
00:18:12,923 --> 00:18:14,390
There's more.

143
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:16,023
There's always more.

144
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:19,551
"Do you not appreciate, Son,
that a marriage contract is a legal...

145
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,427
"...and enforceable document...

146
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:28,665
"...and the penalty for its breach
is your imprisonment?

147
00:18:29,673 --> 00:18:34,201
"A reprisal, the dear <i>madame</i> assures me,
she will use without hesitation.

148

"I beg that you reconsider
and return immediately to your betrothed...

149

"...who is most eager for your return."

150
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,020
Does the thought of your blushing bride
hasten your departure, my lover?

151
00:18:48,526 --> 00:18:52,587
I hasten because of the prison sentence
that bitch mother of hers...

152
00:18:52,663 --> 00:18:54,961
...would be only too happy
to impose on me.

153
00:18:55,766 --> 00:18:59,793
"In anticipation of your acquiescence,
I remain your most loving...

154
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,838
"...and devoted father."

155
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:05,569
- That <i>merde!</i>
- What did you say, Louis?

156
00:19:05,643 --> 00:19:07,270
I said <i>"merde."</i>

157
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:11,174
<i>Merde,</i> my sweet Laura.

158
00:21:26,217 --> 00:21:30,244
Behold the maiden waiting for her
immolation to the pagan god.

159
00:21:33,924 --> 00:21:35,084
Renée.

160
00:21:37,394 --> 00:21:40,955
- <i>Monsieur,</i> my husband.
- That is correct. I am your husband.

161
00:21:42,032 --> 00:21:43,090
Yes.

162
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,459
You must regard me as
a fellow human being. I won't devour you.

163
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:48,929
No.

164
00:21:49,907 --> 00:21:52,171
I've come to give you pleasure...

165
00:21:53,777 --> 00:21:55,870
...not rend you limb from limb.

166
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,369
I know.

167
00:21:58,349 --> 00:22:00,340
Then cease your trembling.

168
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:09,120
You may look at me.

169
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:17,992
You are permitted to regard
the monster's face.

170
00:22:20,237 --> 00:22:21,226
<i>Voil!</i>

171
00:22:22,806 --> 00:22:23,966
Now...

172
00:22:25,576 --> 00:22:26,804
...a smile.

173
00:22:30,247 --> 00:22:31,612
Enchanting.

174
00:22:33,484 --> 00:22:35,008
Now a kiss.

175
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:47,658
If I wished to kiss a statue,
I'd visit a museum.

176
00:22:49,633 --> 00:22:50,793
Relax.

177
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:00,935
I will perform my duty.
I will yield to you your marriage rights.

178
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,308
No.

179
00:23:10,721 --> 00:23:12,188
No, sweet wife.

180
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:15,281
Take a moment...

181
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,355
...let your fervor moderate...

182
00:23:21,832 --> 00:23:23,959
...or it might overwhelm me.

183
00:26:24,281 --> 00:26:25,407
Enough!

184
00:26:28,185 --> 00:26:32,918
Don't you ever, ever say, "Enough," to me.

185
00:26:33,824 --> 00:26:35,257
I paid for you.

186
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,926
You understand that? I paid for you.

187
00:26:39,396 --> 00:26:42,695
I pay for your pleasure. And I'll have it.

188
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:45,691
Do as I say...

189
00:26:46,637 --> 00:26:48,002
...as I need...

190
00:26:51,074 --> 00:26:52,666
...or I'll punish you.

191
00:26:54,611 --> 00:26:59,480
That is to say, if such pleasure
can be considered punishment.

192
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,882
- But it hurts.
- Of course it hurts.

193
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:05,988
But that's what gives me pleasure.

194
00:27:06,623 --> 00:27:07,954
And that...

195
00:27:09,026 --> 00:27:10,789
...is what's important.

196
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,356
Self.

197
00:27:15,732 --> 00:27:18,724
Nature speaks to self...

198
00:27:20,737 --> 00:27:21,965
...only.

199
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,738
You have your nature...

200
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,405
...and I have mine.

201
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,179
You shall do as I want.

202
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:34,247
Seize him!

203
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,009
Come on.

204
00:27:38,755 --> 00:27:40,347
Marquis de Sade.

205
00:27:40,757 --> 00:27:44,523
I arrest you for vile excesses
committed with these innocent girls.

206
00:27:45,629 --> 00:27:46,721
Innocent?

207
00:27:48,465 --> 00:27:49,796
These whores?

208
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:51,895
Innocent?

209
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:56,168
My dear Marais, one has only to look.

210
00:27:56,573 --> 00:27:58,040
Take him out.

211
00:28:34,645 --> 00:28:36,670
You may come out if you wish.

212
00:28:40,117 --> 00:28:41,414
But what...

213
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,848
Who put me here?

214
00:28:45,589 --> 00:28:48,683
You put yourself there.
You can come out anytime.

215
00:28:51,495 --> 00:28:55,659
- The next scene concerns the occasion...
- No, there's no time for that now.

216
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:58,163
- I must find...
- Find what?

217
00:28:58,568 --> 00:29:00,035
I don't know.

218
00:29:00,137 --> 00:29:02,469
But I cannot stay here with you.

219
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:06,241
And where are you going, <i>monsieur?</i>

220
00:29:06,877 --> 00:29:08,037
To see Anne.

221
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:11,809
That's exactly what you must not do.

222
00:29:17,254 --> 00:29:21,190
I'm afraid that we'll never agree on
what I must or must not do, <i>madame.</i>

223
00:29:21,258 --> 00:29:24,421
I had hoped you wouldn't
remain bitter, <i>monsieur.</i>

224
00:29:25,328 --> 00:29:26,556
Did you?

225
00:29:28,298 --> 00:29:31,893
You're wrong to blame me
for the ugliness you endured...

226
00:29:31,968 --> 00:29:33,868
...at the Fortress of Vincennes, <i>monsieur.</i>

227
00:29:33,937 --> 00:29:35,700
Where's Anne going?

228
00:29:36,106 --> 00:29:40,338
I don't think you appreciate
it was I who obtained your release.

229
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:47,879
You turned the keys both ways, <i>madame.</i>

230
00:29:48,351 --> 00:29:52,378
Nevertheless, you agreed
to the conditions of your release...

231
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,215
...without qualifications.

232
00:30:00,597 --> 00:30:02,121
You're sending her away.

233
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:07,432
You agreed to absent yourself from Paris,
to remain here permanently with your wife.

234
00:30:08,071 --> 00:30:10,369
Not an extraordinary requirement
from a husband.

235
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,841
- Why are you sending Anne away?
- My daughter is going to her convent.

236
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:16,276
- Her convent?
- She's a canoness...

237
00:30:16,646 --> 00:30:20,377
...and a three-month residence each year
is a requirement...

238
00:30:20,817 --> 00:30:22,546
...of that station.

239
00:30:24,621 --> 00:30:26,145
But, <i>madame,</i> l...

240
00:30:26,256 --> 00:30:30,215
Do not distress yourself.
We do not intend her to take the vows.

241
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:35,591
The bride of Christ she will not be,
but in due course, she will marry.

242
00:30:36,366 --> 00:30:40,359
These things cannot be changed by you,
nor by any man.

243
00:30:40,871 --> 00:30:43,203
Not by God, if you had your way.

244
00:30:43,473 --> 00:30:45,566
Do not blaspheme, <i>monsieur.</i>

245
00:30:48,478 --> 00:30:52,039
If you do try to stop her,
we will all suffer in one way...

246
00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:53,412
...or another.

247
00:30:53,483 --> 00:30:57,510
But it will be you, <i>monsieur,</i>
who will suffer the direct penalty.

248
00:31:00,657 --> 00:31:04,457
As I love you as my son, <i>monsieur,</i>
I cannot let this happen to you.

249
00:31:05,095 --> 00:31:08,292
I'm sending her away, <i>monsieur,</i>
for your sake.

250
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:10,930
Do you understand that?

251
00:31:14,004 --> 00:31:15,801
I understand, <i>madame.</i>

252
00:31:16,673 --> 00:31:18,300
I'm glad you do.

253

I intrude.

265
00:32:52,969 --> 00:32:55,233
No. This is <i>Mademoiselle</i> Colette.

266
00:32:56,539 --> 00:33:00,168
Maman and I are to sponsor her debut
at court this season.

267
00:33:00,277 --> 00:33:02,609
And this is her singing master,
<i>Signor</i> Amaletti.

268
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:04,613
- Your Excellency.
- Maestro.

269
00:33:04,681 --> 00:33:08,412
My son-in-law has little interest
in the ambitions of a vocalist...

270
00:33:08,518 --> 00:33:10,748
...I assure you, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

271
00:33:11,388 --> 00:33:14,516
You always complain there's little time
for your scribbling.

272
00:33:14,591 --> 00:33:18,652
Well, there's no time like the present.
Be off, <i>monsieur.</i>

273
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:25,800
Pray continue, child. It's delightful.

00:34:43,413 --> 00:34:44,937
Coming, <i>madame.</i>

281
00:34:54,324 --> 00:34:55,985
Did I hear voices?

282
00:34:56,459 --> 00:35:00,418
Voices, <i>madame?</i> Perhaps you heard me
speaking in my sleep.

283
00:35:00,864 --> 00:35:02,388
Did I wake you?

284
00:35:03,066 --> 00:35:04,328
No.

285
00:35:05,335 --> 00:35:06,700
I sleep poorly at best.

286
00:35:07,137 --> 00:35:11,836
I'm truly sorry to hear that, <i>monsieur.</i>
Perhaps the bed is not quite comfortable?

287
00:35:11,908 --> 00:35:15,309
Only lonely in my sweet wife's absence.

288
00:35:15,745 --> 00:35:19,010
Besides, I fear that sleep will always be...

289
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:25,020
...an elusive butterfly
trapped only by men of easy conscience.

290
00:35:28,191 --> 00:35:31,524
Do you mind if I talk to you as a parent?

291
00:35:32,996 --> 00:35:33,985
<i>Madame.</i>

292
00:35:36,499 --> 00:35:39,263
I would be your son if you would have me.

293
00:35:41,137 --> 00:35:46,234
You've behaved so well these last
few months. I feel I would be churlish...

294
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:50,211
...to keep you here any longer,
especially with the season starting.

295
00:35:50,814 --> 00:35:53,840
<i>Madame,</i> I adore you.

296
00:36:21,311 --> 00:36:22,778
<i>Mademoiselle?</i>

297
00:36:26,616 --> 00:36:28,106
A thousand pardons, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

298
00:36:28,184 --> 00:36:31,176
What Louis?
You do not know La Beauvoisin?

299
00:36:31,855 --> 00:36:33,379
That's a scandal, my darling.

300
00:36:33,823 --> 00:36:37,486
Tell me quickly, how can
the abyss of my ignorance be crossed?

301
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,523
My honor, I claim it.

302
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:44,559
For if ever destiny arranged
an introduction between...

303
00:36:44,634 --> 00:36:49,628
...need I say,
our most magnificent actress in Paris...

304
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,806
<i>...Mademoiselle</i> La Beauvoisin...

305
00:36:54,277 --> 00:36:57,075
...and his Excellence, the Marquis de Sade.

306
00:36:57,881 --> 00:37:00,816
The Marquis? Of course, I know.

307
00:37:02,285 --> 00:37:05,083
Your servant, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

308
00:37:06,756 --> 00:37:09,247
I thought it might be the opposite.

309
00:37:29,412 --> 00:37:32,108
- Shall I predict your future?
- My entire future?

310
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:36,215
Only your immediate future.
Eternity is for clerics.

311
00:37:37,287 --> 00:37:40,814
You shall come to Castle La Coste,
and you shall be my mistress.

312
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:44,849
Naturally, for what other reason
would you take me to La Coste?

313
00:37:45,094 --> 00:37:48,621
There are other reasons.
I will build a theater at La Coste.

314
00:37:48,698 --> 00:37:53,726
<i>There I will produce an endless round</i>
<i>of plays, diversions and entertainments.</i>

315
00:38:10,086 --> 00:38:12,850
Can a man not kiss his own wife in public?

316
00:38:17,093 --> 00:38:21,154
Is the law of the state, that decrees one
thing, superior to the law of imagination...

317
00:38:21,231 --> 00:38:23,199
...that decrees another?

318
00:38:23,666 --> 00:38:25,031
I hold not.

319
00:38:27,403 --> 00:38:28,461
Men and women...

320
00:38:28,538 --> 00:38:33,237
For gentlemen and ladies
we know you're not!

321
00:38:46,689 --> 00:38:51,251
Let us agree there is no one single reality...

322
00:38:51,728 --> 00:38:54,663
...not on this stage, not in this world.

323
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:57,233
All is in the mind.

324
00:38:59,736 --> 00:39:02,967
Imagination is the only truth...

325
00:39:06,376 --> 00:39:10,972
"...because it cannot be contradicted
except by other imaginations."

326
00:39:14,951 --> 00:39:18,944
This theater will present
the spinning world in essence.

327
00:39:19,989 --> 00:39:22,514
Shakespeare called the world a stage.

328
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:24,890
Well, our stage...

329
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:27,853
...shall be our world.

330
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,941
- Tonight then...
- In honor of my uncle...

331
00:39:40,243 --> 00:39:42,905
The esteemed Abbé de Sade.

332
00:39:43,613 --> 00:39:46,639
...we shall present a minor segment...

333
00:39:46,983 --> 00:39:49,645
...of a major tragicomedy entitled:

334
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:51,179
<i>Childhood...</i>

335
00:39:51,254 --> 00:39:54,519
<i>... of Poor Little Louis Alphonse.</i>

336
00:39:57,026 --> 00:40:00,723
- The setting:
- The riding stables of Château Maubel.

337
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,569
The private estate of the esteemed
personage, the Abbé de Sade.

338
00:40:16,412 --> 00:40:17,504
The occasion:

339
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:21,448
Lmmediately following a brisk canter
through the forest of Maubel...

340
00:40:21,517 --> 00:40:24,577
...in the company of two ladies...

341
00:40:25,254 --> 00:40:28,121
...his housekeeper and her niece.

342
00:40:28,191 --> 00:40:29,658
The characters:

343
00:40:31,728 --> 00:40:33,889
<i>Madame</i> Grandcourt...

344
00:40:35,965 --> 00:40:40,163
...the housekeeper, and her niece...

345
00:40:40,236 --> 00:40:43,262
<i>...Mademoiselle</i> Cerise-lntactus.

346
00:40:46,342 --> 00:40:50,073
And poor little Louis Alphonse himself.

347
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:57,980
And last, but of course, not least...

348
00:41:01,357 --> 00:41:04,121
...Abbé de Sade, in person.

349
00:41:11,734 --> 00:41:15,192
"Now, here's a stallion
for you to ride, niece."

350
00:41:15,972 --> 00:41:17,462
"Or vice-versa."

351
00:41:17,907 --> 00:41:21,866
"And as fine a set of flanks
as you'll find anywhere."

352
00:41:23,212 --> 00:41:25,009
"The finest flanks.

353
00:41:25,782 --> 00:41:28,182
"The finest for you, dear Reverend."

354
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:31,984
"Shy little vixen, eh?

355
00:41:33,122 --> 00:41:37,855
"Well, give her some wine
to make her loosen her reserve."

356
00:41:37,927 --> 00:41:39,588
"It is not to my taste, sir."

357
00:41:39,662 --> 00:41:42,392
"Why then, girl, sit down...

358
00:41:42,799 --> 00:41:45,165
"...and drink it in one gulp."

359
00:41:50,306 --> 00:41:52,501
"Auntie, what is happening?"

360
00:41:52,608 --> 00:41:54,701
"You're drinking wine, girl."

361
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,770
"No wonder I like it so much, Auntie."

362
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:04,686
"Drink, child, drink.
Do not displease the Abbé."

363
00:42:20,269 --> 00:42:23,295
"The little rascal's spying on us, eh?"

364
00:42:36,285 --> 00:42:37,513
Stop it!

365
00:42:37,787 --> 00:42:40,551
Come here.

366
00:42:47,263 --> 00:42:48,730
Spying on us, were you?

367
00:42:51,467 --> 00:42:55,198
You're a very naughty boy.
You shall have a proper spanking.

368
00:42:55,972 --> 00:42:58,941
- Lf you spank me, I'll tell.
- Tell what?

369
00:42:59,008 --> 00:43:00,999
Tell what you were doing.

370
00:43:02,512 --> 00:43:05,003
That would be foolish.
Nobody would believe you.

371
00:43:05,081 --> 00:43:08,175
- They would only call you evil-minded.
- You are evil.

372
00:43:08,684 --> 00:43:11,278
Mark this, boy.
Matters little what one does...

373
00:43:11,354 --> 00:43:14,687
...so long as one presents
the face of virtue to the world.

374
00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:16,783
That's hypocrisy.

375
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:19,623
And where did you learn
that arrogant word?

376
00:43:20,162 --> 00:43:22,357
I learned it. And it's true.

377
00:43:22,431 --> 00:43:24,763
What a clever lad you've become.

378
00:43:26,202 --> 00:43:27,692
Don't let him.

379
00:43:29,005 --> 00:43:30,495
- Hold him.
- Don't let him hurt me.

380
00:43:30,907 --> 00:43:33,102
Come here, lass. Good girl.

381
00:43:43,786 --> 00:43:45,117
Flay the culprit.

382
00:43:50,326 --> 00:43:52,453
- Punish him.
- Do it, niece. Do it.

383
00:43:55,798 --> 00:43:58,096
Or it'll be you under the lash.

384
00:44:02,405 --> 00:44:03,565
Again.

385
00:44:49,418 --> 00:44:51,943
"Louis is a good boy...

386
00:44:52,321 --> 00:44:53,481
"...now."

387
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:05,856
Uncle.
Well, how did you like our little play?

388
00:46:05,928 --> 00:46:07,589
Bravo, Louis.

389
00:46:07,663 --> 00:46:09,528
A triumph, your greatest...

390
00:46:09,598 --> 00:46:12,192
...whose applause will echo
throughout France.

391
00:46:12,568 --> 00:46:13,865
Thank you, Uncle.

392
00:46:13,936 --> 00:46:15,961
But fame has its price.

393
00:46:16,038 --> 00:46:19,007
And no doubt your mother-in-law
will exact it.

394
00:46:19,341 --> 00:46:22,708
I'm very much afraid
you'll be going back to prison, Louis.

395
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:24,546
But that's tomorrow...

396
00:46:24,613 --> 00:46:27,411
...and we live for the moment,
don't we Louis?

397
00:46:27,483 --> 00:46:29,951
What matter if your wife is
six months pregnant...

398
00:46:30,553 --> 00:46:32,987
...if you go deeper and deeper into debt?

399
00:46:33,255 --> 00:46:34,882
You enjoy yourself.

400
00:46:35,691 --> 00:46:37,682
I have a little something arranged...

401
00:46:38,327 --> 00:46:40,124
...a very special treat.

402
00:46:42,264 --> 00:46:44,027
- In there?
- In there.

403
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,263
Something guaranteed
to tear your soul from its bosom.

404
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:45,022
Is there someone here?

405
00:47:48,464 --> 00:47:50,295
Is there anyone here?

406
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:54,897
A friend who mourns.
Mourn with me, Louis.

407
00:47:57,506 --> 00:47:58,803
I cannot.

408
00:48:00,176 --> 00:48:01,905
Didn't you love your father?

409
00:48:03,078 --> 00:48:04,943
What was there to love?

410
00:48:09,385 --> 00:48:12,786
He let my mother cut me loose
when I was only a child.

411
00:48:15,157 --> 00:48:17,250
And I kept waiting for him.

412
00:48:18,594 --> 00:48:20,653
Staying in no place for more than...

413
00:48:22,264 --> 00:48:23,356
...months.

414
00:48:27,269 --> 00:48:29,237
Except five years once.

415
00:48:30,105 --> 00:48:31,504
With my uncle.

416
00:48:33,142 --> 00:48:35,042
Those five years...

417
00:48:35,811 --> 00:48:38,109
You blame your father for that?

418
00:48:39,114 --> 00:48:40,206
I do.

419
00:48:40,983 --> 00:48:43,076
You are unjust then, Louis.

420
00:48:47,723 --> 00:48:48,747
Who are you?

421
00:54:21,156 --> 00:54:22,145
No.

422
00:54:22,224 --> 00:54:24,124
I cannot withdraw my charge.

423
00:54:25,027 --> 00:54:28,963
Not if you should offer me 1,000 crowns.

424
00:54:29,898 --> 00:54:32,332
That is a great amount of money,
<i>mademoiselle.</i>

425
00:54:33,569 --> 00:54:35,127
I am greatly injured.

426
00:54:36,672 --> 00:54:40,438
Shall we say L1,000, <i>mademoiselle?</i>

427
00:54:42,578 --> 00:54:46,275
Say you do go to court,
and say you win your case.

428
00:54:47,416 --> 00:54:49,680
And you know what courts are nowadays...

429
00:54:49,751 --> 00:54:52,720
...with a commoner against a person...

430
00:54:52,788 --> 00:54:53,948
...of noble birth.

431
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:56,853
With his reputation?

432
00:54:57,793 --> 00:55:01,490
He's been in enough scandals on his own
without me, that one.

433
00:55:02,431 --> 00:55:04,058
I'll win, all right.

434
00:55:05,434 --> 00:55:08,267
Shall we say L1,250?

435
00:55:08,337 --> 00:55:12,239
And only because
I sympathize with you, Rose, not with him.

436
00:55:13,508 --> 00:55:14,497
Well...

437
00:55:14,776 --> 00:55:16,073
Consider, Rose.

438
00:55:18,247 --> 00:55:19,908
I have been abused!

439
00:55:19,982 --> 00:55:22,712
L1,500, girl, or nothing.

440
00:55:23,252 --> 00:55:26,153
My husband is president
of the Paris courts.

441
00:55:26,321 --> 00:55:28,755
You can be jailed as a prostitute.

442
00:55:33,128 --> 00:55:35,358
I suggest you accept my offer.

443
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:39,997
All right. I'll take the L1,500 then.

444
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:46,173
Show <i>Madame</i> Keller
to her carriage, please.

445
00:55:47,009 --> 00:55:48,874
A wise decision, Rose.

446
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,784
When will you return to
La Coste with your wife?

447
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:03,321
We made a bargain.

448
00:56:03,392 --> 00:56:06,190
And this time, you're going to stick by it.

449
00:56:06,261 --> 00:56:07,489
François...

450
00:56:10,098 --> 00:56:14,000
...bring me wine.
My throat is dry from too much listening.

451
00:56:14,236 --> 00:56:19,731
François, no wine for his Lordship.
No wine at any time, unless I approve it.

452
00:56:19,808 --> 00:56:21,207
Yes, <i>madame.</i>

453
00:56:23,712 --> 00:56:28,411
That was unnecessary, <i>madame,</i> to rob me
of my dignity in front of a servant.

454
00:56:31,253 --> 00:56:36,520
You rob us all of dignity before the world.

455
00:56:37,292 --> 00:56:40,261
And your honor is no better
than your morality.

456
00:56:40,996 --> 00:56:43,294
You go today to La Coste...

457
00:56:44,132 --> 00:56:47,226
...with your wife
and stay there permanently.

458
00:56:47,903 --> 00:56:50,599
You do this because I say so...

459
00:56:51,373 --> 00:56:55,070
...because in your financial state,
you have no other choice!

460
00:56:55,777 --> 00:57:00,237
Either that,
or I will let the dogs have at you!

461
00:57:48,797 --> 00:57:49,786
Anne!

462
00:58:02,077 --> 00:58:03,305
Louis?

463
00:58:07,048 --> 00:58:08,572
What are you doing to me?

464
00:58:08,884 --> 00:58:10,875
I, Nephew?

465
00:58:16,758 --> 00:58:18,623
Why can't I reach her?

466
00:58:19,494 --> 00:58:21,394
Why must you reach her?

467
00:58:21,797 --> 00:58:23,662
Because I must.

468
00:58:25,267 --> 00:58:26,996
There's a moment...

469
00:58:28,637 --> 00:58:30,070
...and she's part of it.

470
00:58:31,072 --> 00:58:33,939
Your "moment of reality" again.

471
00:58:35,544 --> 00:58:37,136
I want to be with her.

472
00:58:39,548 --> 00:58:43,848
Then count to eight.
Eight is the magic number.

473
00:58:45,587 --> 00:58:47,555
Eight is your answer.

474
00:58:48,824 --> 00:58:51,019
You must accept my direction.

475
00:58:51,793 --> 00:58:54,387
You have no hope otherwise.

476
00:58:56,031 --> 00:58:57,055
One...

477
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,594
...two...

478
00:59:00,902 --> 00:59:02,130
...three...

479
00:59:03,171 --> 00:59:04,365
...four...

480
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,005
...five...

481
00:59:07,876 --> 00:59:08,865
...six...

482
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:11,873
...seven...

483
00:59:13,315 --> 00:59:14,304
...eight.

484
00:59:24,326 --> 00:59:27,159
Put those chairs on either side of the door.

485
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:42,139
Move that table back.

486
00:59:42,344 --> 00:59:43,333
Sir?

487
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:46,471
I said I wanted no one here
while I was rehearsing.

488
00:59:50,152 --> 00:59:51,244
Anne.

489
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,813
I'm sorry. I intrude.

490
00:59:54,823 --> 00:59:56,017
I'll go.

491
00:59:56,825 --> 00:59:57,849
No.

492
00:59:58,927 --> 01:00:00,451
You'll do no such thing.

493
01:00:02,164 --> 01:00:06,897
I wanted to see your theater for so long.
You've written so often about it.

494
01:00:07,269 --> 01:00:08,793
Yes, of course.

495
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:16,945
It's as lovely as you described it
in your beautiful letters.

496
01:00:18,013 --> 01:00:19,002
Come.

497
01:00:19,348 --> 01:00:20,713
Come up on the stage.

498
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:35,395
Well, do you like it?

499
01:00:37,566 --> 01:00:38,965
It's beautiful.

500
01:00:40,202 --> 01:00:42,500
Is it supposed to be a ballroom?

501
01:00:43,338 --> 01:00:46,705
Yes. It's a ballroom for a play I've written.

502
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:50,407
I've been working on it night and day.

503
01:00:50,479 --> 01:00:52,640
Poor Louis. I must leave you to work.

504
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:56,207
No, please. I cherish your concern for me.

505
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,247
My work isn't so important.

506
01:01:00,422 --> 01:01:01,946
But it must be.

507
01:01:02,858 --> 01:01:05,349
There aren't many
who would agree with you.

508
01:01:06,261 --> 01:01:07,455
Tell me...

509
01:01:08,797 --> 01:01:12,733
...why are you the only one who never
asks me why I do the things I do?

510
01:01:13,335 --> 01:01:15,132
Don't I frighten you?

511
01:01:16,004 --> 01:01:17,733
You know you don't.

512
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:23,844
Perhaps if someone...

513
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:26,809
...gave you love...

514
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:29,984
- I must go now.
- No, wait.

515
01:01:31,453 --> 01:01:33,387
I'd like you to wear this.

516
01:01:33,455 --> 01:01:34,615
What is it?

517
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:36,419
I've always had it.

518
01:01:37,693 --> 01:01:40,389
Then Renée should have it. I must go now.

519
01:01:40,462 --> 01:01:42,123
Come away with me.

520
01:01:42,831 --> 01:01:46,528
Louis, I have no right to be here
and we have no right to talk like this.

521
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:50,368
All right, I agree. I'll stop.

522
01:01:51,573 --> 01:01:54,007
I'll stop. But please don't go.

523
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:56,538
I must.

524
01:02:00,115 --> 01:02:01,377
No, wait.

525
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:04,711
Look.

526
01:02:05,754 --> 01:02:07,619
We're in a ballroom...

527
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:09,921
...alone.

528
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:12,693
It may never happen again.

529
01:02:12,961 --> 01:02:14,053
Come.

530
01:02:14,863 --> 01:02:16,353
Dance with me.

531
01:06:36,358 --> 01:06:37,723
Love me.

532
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:36,178
Not that way, Louis.

533
01:07:38,086 --> 01:07:39,178
Here.

534
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:47,920
Yes.

535
01:07:54,669 --> 01:07:57,570
It's only make-believe, as you can see.

536
01:08:02,277 --> 01:08:03,335
Yes.

537
01:08:04,679 --> 01:08:05,907
Touch it.

538
01:08:09,851 --> 01:08:11,148
That's right.

539
01:08:14,923 --> 01:08:16,584
You can come out.

540
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:18,558
Come along.

541
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,855
Come along. Yes.

542
01:08:24,232 --> 01:08:25,426
<i>Louis.</i>

543
01:08:25,934 --> 01:08:27,128
<i>Where are we?</i>

544
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:30,264
With me, darling.

545
01:08:34,409 --> 01:08:36,843
I was in a nightmare and you called me.

546
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:39,107
I should have let you sleep.

547
01:08:47,689 --> 01:08:49,452
You really are with me.

548
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:54,253
"Come to Italy," I said,
and you didn't blink an eye.

549
01:08:54,829 --> 01:08:56,228
You just said yes.

550
01:08:57,032 --> 01:08:58,124
Madness.

551
01:08:58,433 --> 01:09:00,230
Madness, I agree.

552
01:09:01,469 --> 01:09:03,699
- And quite awful.
- No, wonderful.

553
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:06,002
To run off with you? Awful.

554
01:09:12,447 --> 01:09:15,939
Promise me something.
You'll never leave me.

555
01:09:16,985 --> 01:09:18,577
I will never leave you.

556
01:09:18,653 --> 01:09:21,349
Baron Rothschild's residence,
your Excellency.

557
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:26,693
Must you see him?

558
01:09:26,761 --> 01:09:28,786
Well, we need money to travel.

559
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:30,329
No, please.

560
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:36,594
There's no danger.
At dawn, we'll be in Italy.

561
01:09:55,657 --> 01:09:56,646
Halt!

562
01:10:13,508 --> 01:10:14,497
Drive on!

563
01:10:17,345 --> 01:10:18,334
Fire!

564
01:11:57,779 --> 01:11:59,747
You're trembling, Louis.

565
01:12:00,281 --> 01:12:01,305
Am I?

566
01:12:02,417 --> 01:12:03,475
Why?

567
01:12:05,787 --> 01:12:06,879
Fear.

568
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:09,718
Why now?

569
01:12:12,093 --> 01:12:14,687
Because I have something to lose now.

570
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:19,729
I found my moment.

571
01:12:22,003 --> 01:12:23,163
And I don't know...

572
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:24,262
What?

573
01:12:27,142 --> 01:12:29,007
...if I can hold on to it.

574
01:12:33,381 --> 01:12:34,643
And yet...

575
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:37,980
You talk in riddles, lover. Yet what?

576
01:12:39,821 --> 01:12:42,051
And yet, on the other hand...

577
01:12:44,058 --> 01:12:46,618
...it can never be taken away from me.

578
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:46,210
If you step outside that door,
there won't be one friend who will...

579
01:13:46,287 --> 01:13:49,085
...give you even food
to keep you from starving.

580
01:13:49,524 --> 01:13:53,517
I'm not afraid of your threats.
I shall not be dominated by you.

581
01:13:54,829 --> 01:13:58,822
You repeat that like a catechism
you've learned...

582
01:14:00,568 --> 01:14:04,527
...from that man
who has wrecked all of our lives.

583
01:14:06,674 --> 01:14:10,610
Don't you understand
that I'm trying to rescue the last threads...

584
01:14:10,678 --> 01:14:13,078
...of self-respect for all of us?

585
01:14:13,781 --> 01:14:16,716
Lord and Lady de Beaumont have made
a generous offer.

586
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:19,786
You've bought me their son as a suitor
and call them generous?

587
01:14:19,954 --> 01:14:22,855
For soiled goods,
I should say, very generous.

588
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:25,551
If I agree, will you have Louis freed?

589
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:31,225
The de Beaumonts' only condition was that
he should remain where he is permanently.

590
01:14:32,066 --> 01:14:33,966
Yes, just one condition:

591
01:14:34,168 --> 01:14:37,934
That a man stays locked in a filthy prison
and ruins his life.

592
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:41,433
This is past discussion now.

593
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:46,009
What I want is your agreement now.

594
01:14:48,349 --> 01:14:50,214
What shall I do, Louis?

595
01:14:50,718 --> 01:14:53,380
I've always been especially
fond of you, my dear.

596
01:14:55,557 --> 01:15:00,517
Despite the discrepancy in our ages,
I feel very close to you in every way.

597
01:15:00,595 --> 01:15:01,584
Abbé.

598
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:05,531
Put your head here and give vent
to your grief over poor, wretched Louis...

599
01:15:05,733 --> 01:15:07,701
...in his faraway prison.

600
01:15:07,835 --> 01:15:11,703
Shed your tears freely,
let them wet my shirt through...

601
01:15:12,073 --> 01:15:14,337
...and sting my loving bosom.

602
01:15:14,609 --> 01:15:15,701
Abbé.

603
01:15:16,277 --> 01:15:17,266
How say you, Louis?

604
01:15:17,979 --> 01:15:20,777
Will the moment
when she lusts in bed with me...

605
01:15:21,349 --> 01:15:24,409
...be the moment of reality you seek?

606
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:43,960
You.

607
01:15:48,309 --> 01:15:50,277
What are you doing here?

608
01:15:52,146 --> 01:15:55,309
I don't need your answer.
I know why you've come.

609
01:15:56,951 --> 01:15:58,748
You've come to gloat.

610
01:15:59,153 --> 01:16:01,246
Come to watch me chained...

611
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:04,314
...begging for mercy.

612
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:09,496
Well, what passion does my degradation
arouse in you, <i>madame?</i>

613
01:16:11,132 --> 01:16:16,229
What unspeakable stirrings are there
in your breasts and belly...

614
01:16:17,805 --> 01:16:19,705
...to see poor Louis...

615
01:16:20,341 --> 01:16:21,831
...crushed...

616
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:24,475
...in his loathsome dungeon?

617
01:16:27,548 --> 01:16:29,277
Well, answer me!

618
01:16:33,588 --> 01:16:34,680
What?

619
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:38,819
Crying?

620
01:16:46,734 --> 01:16:47,792
Why?

621
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:50,129
For me?

622
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:52,897
Now you would cry for me?

623
01:16:53,574 --> 01:16:54,563
Why?

624
01:16:57,612 --> 01:16:59,307
You cry for yourself.

625
01:17:01,082 --> 01:17:04,779
That's it. Because I reveal you to yourself.

626
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:10,517
Yes. You see in yourself the corruption
you thought was only in me...

627
01:17:12,326 --> 01:17:14,191
...but is in all of us.

628
01:17:15,129 --> 01:17:16,824
And you weep to see it.

629
01:17:17,732 --> 01:17:18,858
No...

630
01:17:20,568 --> 01:17:22,559
...I don't weep for you.

631
01:17:24,338 --> 01:17:25,930
Your weakness...

632
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:31,410
...made you deserve
every punishment you received.

633
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,004
Nor for myself.

634
01:17:36,651 --> 01:17:38,118
My strength...

635
01:17:38,419 --> 01:17:42,082
...can bear whatever befalls me.

636
01:17:45,359 --> 01:17:46,485
I weep...

637
01:17:50,598 --> 01:17:51,587
For whom?

638
01:17:53,234 --> 01:17:56,931
For Renée, who is innocent.

639
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:02,666
And who loves you, God help her.

640
01:18:16,124 --> 01:18:17,455
What if...

641
01:18:21,262 --> 01:18:22,627
...I changed?

642
01:18:27,301 --> 01:18:28,962
You cannot change.

643
01:18:30,037 --> 01:18:32,471
And your promises mean nothing.

644
01:18:33,541 --> 01:18:35,270
The Devil owns you.

645
01:18:38,846 --> 01:18:42,179
No, <i>madame,</i> that's something
you shall never understand.

646
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:44,676
It's not the Devil, <i>madame.</i>

647
01:18:49,223 --> 01:18:51,748
It is our nature.

648
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:54,621
You say that, write it...

649
01:18:55,797 --> 01:18:59,597
...and I don't understand what you mean.

650
01:19:00,601 --> 01:19:04,128
You see everybody else in your own image.

651
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:08,241
I am trying to make you realize...

652
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:14,212
...that you cannot flay her pure soul...

653
01:19:15,116 --> 01:19:19,177
...as you flay the wanton flesh of whores.

654
01:19:20,421 --> 01:19:25,358
You still don't understand the enormity
of what you've done.

655
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:29,656
You've deserted a wife who loves you...

656
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:34,126
...you've abandoned your children
who love you...

657
01:19:35,703 --> 01:19:36,931
...and who...

658
01:19:38,139 --> 01:19:42,803
Who did you pervert
to serve your hellish plans?

659
01:19:43,811 --> 01:19:47,679
Your wife's own sister! My flesh!

660
01:19:48,549 --> 01:19:50,244
My daughter, Anne!

661
01:19:51,352 --> 01:19:54,981
And you still ask me why I weep?

662
01:20:02,296 --> 01:20:03,593
I beg you...

663
01:20:03,698 --> 01:20:05,165
...give me...

664
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:06,824
...one...

665
01:20:07,535 --> 01:20:09,025
...one chance.

666
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:14,965
I tell you, Louis. I tell you now.

667
01:20:17,044 --> 01:20:20,844
You will never, never be free again.

668
01:20:21,883 --> 01:20:26,081
You will stay here in this prison
for the rest of your life.

669
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:31,081
Look well on these walls
where you are now, Louis.

670
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:34,491
Because this is...

671
01:20:35,930 --> 01:20:37,921
...where you're going to die.

672
01:20:50,244 --> 01:20:53,805
<i>Madame,</i> I will change.

673
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:56,807
I will change!

674
01:20:57,952 --> 01:20:59,613
I swear it!

675
01:21:00,321 --> 01:21:03,518
I will change!

676
01:21:18,172 --> 01:21:19,161
Uncle?

677
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:20,468
"Silence!"

678
01:21:20,775 --> 01:21:24,643
Please, Uncle, no plays. Not now, please.

679
01:21:24,946 --> 01:21:26,709
"I insist on silence!"

680
01:21:27,381 --> 01:21:28,575
Please.

681
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:31,818
- Anne is dead.
- "Seize the prisoner."

682
01:21:35,256 --> 01:21:38,089
No! No, damn you!

683
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:40,184
Take off those damn masks.

684
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:45,865
The farce is over!

685
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,661
"You may continue with the prosecution."

686
01:21:48,736 --> 01:21:51,068
"We will prove beyond a doubt, my Lord...

687
01:21:51,238 --> 01:21:56,608
"...that Louis Alphonse Donatien,
the Marquis de Sade, did willfully take...

688
01:21:56,677 --> 01:22:00,636
"...the life of his sister-in-law,
Lady Anne-Prospere de Launay."

689
01:22:01,148 --> 01:22:02,137
Life?

690
01:22:02,516 --> 01:22:04,006
"First witness."

691
01:22:06,587 --> 01:22:10,523
"Inspector Marais, what is your estimate
of the character of the accused?"

692
01:22:10,591 --> 01:22:15,255
"He is evil, he is degenerate,
he is an animal to be put away."

693
01:22:16,197 --> 01:22:18,893
But I had nothing to do with her death.

694
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:21,998
She died of the plague.

695
01:22:23,137 --> 01:22:28,837
God, why do I bother to argue with you?
Uncle, please stop these damn plays.

696
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,474
"I have more witnesses.

697
01:22:39,553 --> 01:22:44,149
"These three are aunts of the accused,
my own good sisters...

698
01:22:44,225 --> 01:22:48,491
"...honorable abbesses, virtuous women,
who devoted themselves...

699
01:22:48,562 --> 01:22:52,225
"...to caring for him as a child.
Will one of you speak in his behalf?"

700
01:22:52,299 --> 01:22:54,267
"My nephew is evil, ungrateful."

701
01:22:54,635 --> 01:22:55,602
No!

702
01:22:55,669 --> 01:22:57,660
"My nephew is degenerate, an animal."

703
01:22:57,738 --> 01:22:58,727
No!

704
01:22:58,806 --> 01:23:01,673
"No, my nephew is worse
than any animal."

705
01:23:01,742 --> 01:23:03,972
They're not my aunts, they're actresses.

706
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:05,774
This is a travesty.

707
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:08,808
Uncle, stop this.

708
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:12,614
"Can we then allow a wild animal...

709
01:23:12,686 --> 01:23:16,019
"...to roam free
among the vulnerable human beings?

710
01:23:16,624 --> 01:23:19,821
"This killer of a sweet, innocent girl..."

711
01:23:19,894 --> 01:23:24,422
How dare you say I took her life,
her precious, precious life.

712
01:23:24,498 --> 01:23:25,897
"You killed her."

713
01:24:04,872 --> 01:24:06,567
<i>We had planned...</i>

714
01:24:07,074 --> 01:24:09,042
<i>... but she died of the plague.</i>

715
01:24:09,677 --> 01:24:11,872
<i>There was nothing I could do.</i>

716
01:24:17,852 --> 01:24:19,717
"Speak your judgments."

717
01:24:19,854 --> 01:24:21,651
"Put him away forever!"

718
01:24:25,826 --> 01:24:28,886
"I have here a <i>lettre de cachet</i>
from the King...

719
01:24:29,163 --> 01:24:33,600
"...empowering me to put
the Marquis de Sade in prison...

720
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:35,265
"...forever...

721
01:24:35,336 --> 01:24:37,099
"...and forever!"

722
01:24:37,271 --> 01:24:39,262
"Put him away forever!"

723
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:49,238
No!

724
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,867
Anne, tell them!

725
01:25:17,645 --> 01:25:19,442
"He is my murderer."

726
01:25:24,552 --> 01:25:25,780
"Behead him!"

727
01:26:06,393 --> 01:26:07,621
What do you see?

728
01:26:08,095 --> 01:26:10,188
What do you wish me to see?

729
01:26:11,732 --> 01:26:13,962
What is the meaning of eight?

730
01:26:14,501 --> 01:26:16,992
Eight is the sign of infinity.

731
01:26:17,905 --> 01:26:20,305
The serpent swallowing its tail.

732
01:26:21,542 --> 01:26:23,066
Why do you ask?

733
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:33,914
Can you tell me what this is?

734
01:26:37,958 --> 01:26:40,017
It belonged to your mother.

735
01:26:41,161 --> 01:26:43,095
You stole it from her.

736
01:26:44,298 --> 01:26:45,595
You can see that?

737
01:26:45,966 --> 01:26:47,524
It is very clear.

738
01:26:48,235 --> 01:26:50,260
You were four years old.

739
01:26:51,405 --> 01:26:54,863
You were being sent away
to live with a maiden aunt.

740
01:26:56,210 --> 01:27:00,044
You take this although
your mother cherishes it.

741
01:27:00,814 --> 01:27:01,872
Yes.

742
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:06,985
She cherished her jewels
more than she did me.

743
01:27:08,355 --> 01:27:10,448
I was sold instead of them.

744
01:27:14,962 --> 01:27:16,953
What is to come, gypsy?

745
01:27:17,831 --> 01:27:20,664
A revolution will rend France...

746
01:27:21,368 --> 01:27:23,962
...a bacchanalia of blood.

747
01:27:24,605 --> 01:27:28,268
They will say that you are
one of those who caused it.

748
01:27:30,811 --> 01:27:32,745
What will happen to me, gypsy?

749
01:27:35,316 --> 01:27:37,477
You'll be put in an asylum.

750
01:27:37,718 --> 01:27:39,709
You'll know pain and torment.

751
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:45,617
How long?

752
01:27:45,959 --> 01:27:47,517
Twenty-eight years...

753
01:27:47,828 --> 01:27:49,159
...Nephew.

754
01:27:50,497 --> 01:27:52,089
You, always you.

755
01:27:55,336 --> 01:27:57,201
Corrupter of my youth.

756
01:27:58,138 --> 01:27:59,833
Author of my sins.

757
01:28:00,874 --> 01:28:02,637
Nonsense, Nephew.

758
01:28:03,043 --> 01:28:04,943
Am I a force of nature?

759
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:09,115
I don't know, Uncle, perhaps you are.

760
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:11,741
You yourself proclaimed it:

761
01:28:12,619 --> 01:28:15,019
"Man is not seduced by evil.

762
01:28:15,089 --> 01:28:16,454
"He is evil...

763
01:28:16,757 --> 01:28:18,247
"...evil by nature."

764
01:28:19,259 --> 01:28:22,558
You condemn me for corrupting
that which is already corrupt.

765
01:28:25,265 --> 01:28:26,994
You were my teacher.

766
01:28:28,302 --> 01:28:30,133
Did I teach you falsely?

767
01:28:31,071 --> 01:28:32,732
In one thing, yes.

768
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:34,402
And that?

769
01:28:40,681 --> 01:28:43,775
That's one's pleasure
could be taken by force.

770
01:28:45,219 --> 01:28:48,552
It saddens me, Nephew, but I'm a saint.

771
01:28:49,723 --> 01:28:52,624
You lack the capacity for pleasure.

772
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:54,921
It frightens you.

773
01:28:55,295 --> 01:28:58,389
After the transport,
your soul begins to whimper.

774
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:04,230
You fear God's vengeance in the hereafter
and invite his mercy with a great show...

775
01:29:05,305 --> 01:29:07,239
...of suffering here on earth.

776
01:29:07,541 --> 01:29:09,668
If I am evil, you seduced me.

777
01:29:10,244 --> 01:29:13,042
Initiated rather than seduced.

778
01:29:14,615 --> 01:29:18,346
No, Nephew,
there was only one occasion...

779
01:29:19,119 --> 01:29:22,145
...on which I was required to lay snares.

780
01:29:22,222 --> 01:29:23,814
Demon! Bastard!

781
01:29:25,025 --> 01:29:27,550
Liar! She never gave herself to you.

782
01:29:27,694 --> 01:29:30,788
What if she had?
May I quote an eminent author?

783
01:29:31,131 --> 01:29:35,830
"Love: A disposition of the organs,
nothing more, an appetite."

784
01:29:36,103 --> 01:29:37,695
Marquis de Sade.

785
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:43,309
You rob me of everything...

786
01:29:44,278 --> 01:29:46,803
...even of hope for what might have been.

787
01:29:50,951 --> 01:29:52,350
With her...

788
01:29:53,754 --> 01:29:55,051
...I could...

789
01:29:56,790 --> 01:29:57,779
I could've...

790
01:29:58,692 --> 01:30:00,182
Could have what?

791
01:30:02,429 --> 01:30:03,953
Been different.

792
01:30:05,098 --> 01:30:06,395
Renée.

793
01:30:06,867 --> 01:30:08,232
My husband.

794
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:13,231
I sorrow for the pain I've given you.

795
01:30:14,942 --> 01:30:17,843
Perhaps someday,
you'll be able to understand me.

796
01:30:18,178 --> 01:30:20,840
What life would I have had without you?

797
01:30:21,748 --> 01:30:23,978
I was an ugly, stupid girl and...

798
01:30:25,552 --> 01:30:27,417
...not much of a woman.

799
01:30:29,056 --> 01:30:31,115
There were a few times...

800
01:30:31,992 --> 01:30:33,016
...a few...

801
01:30:37,364 --> 01:30:38,524
You have suffered.

802
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:42,492
At least I could share your fate
as your wife.

803
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:44,665
No one can take that from me.

804
01:30:50,677 --> 01:30:53,111
We shall go to Paris
and you will regain your health.

805
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:57,014
We can't. My mother would
simply put you in the asylum again.

806
01:31:02,222 --> 01:31:03,883
Perhaps she won't.

807
01:31:07,928 --> 01:31:09,589
It's so cold here.

808
01:31:18,205 --> 01:31:21,470
If only we could go to a warm place
for the winter.

809
01:31:23,544 --> 01:31:24,704
Yes.

810
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:28,213
A warm place.

811
01:32:05,252 --> 01:32:07,516
<i>You mean to say you had a choice?</i>

812
01:32:08,322 --> 01:32:10,620
<i>Then good and evil do exist.</i>

813
01:32:11,325 --> 01:32:12,792
<i>And you chose evil.</i>

814
01:32:15,395 --> 01:32:17,488
Poor, damn Louis.

815
01:32:18,966 --> 01:32:20,490
Why then...

816
01:32:21,768 --> 01:32:24,362
...I have no answers.

817
01:32:26,039 --> 01:32:27,028
None.

818
01:32:28,375 --> 01:32:31,469
I can find no meaning to my life.

819
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:37,207
I cannot find my moment of reality
because it does not exist.

820
01:32:37,417 --> 01:32:41,319
Not at all.
Not on the stage, not in the world.

821
01:32:43,023 --> 01:32:44,684
There is no reality.

822
01:32:45,959 --> 01:32:47,790
It's all in the mind.

823
01:32:51,865 --> 01:32:53,628
And there's nothing.

824
01:33:10,017 --> 01:33:12,451
What'll we burn when
all the furniture is gone?

825
01:33:12,519 --> 01:33:13,884
Each other.

826
01:33:22,763 --> 01:33:24,856
Go on! You're doing very well.

827
01:33:35,475 --> 01:33:36,874
Very good!

828
01:33:47,020 --> 01:33:48,009
Burn.

829
01:33:51,792 --> 01:33:54,556
The illumination of my life has gone out.

830
01:33:55,495 --> 01:33:59,454
Do you know what that means?
No, I don't suppose you do.

831
01:34:00,167 --> 01:34:02,328
Well, it doesn't matter.

832
01:34:49,116 --> 01:34:50,743
Bravo!

833
01:34:51,718 --> 01:34:54,152
Come!

834
01:34:55,088 --> 01:34:57,056
Let's put on a play.

835
01:36:20,273 --> 01:36:22,070
Do as you will!

836
01:36:23,443 --> 01:36:26,742
If not compelled, then why must I do
what desire dictates me?

837
01:40:17,010 --> 01:40:17,999
Renée!

838
01:40:36,129 --> 01:40:37,494
Renée!

839
01:40:50,110 --> 01:40:52,442
Forgive me.

840
01:41:02,422 --> 01:41:03,753
Marquis.

841
01:41:10,663 --> 01:41:13,496
It is not my province to forgive.

842
01:41:14,767 --> 01:41:15,756
No.

843
01:41:16,302 --> 01:41:18,236
Nor mine to ask.

844
01:41:24,344 --> 01:41:26,005
Have you been dreaming again?

845
01:41:26,779 --> 01:41:30,215
More than that. Much, much more.

846
01:41:31,050 --> 01:41:32,745
Trying to escape.

847
01:41:33,586 --> 01:41:36,214
At least, the young Marquis was trying.

848
01:41:39,993 --> 01:41:41,460
The young Marquis?

849
01:41:42,462 --> 01:41:43,622
Indeed.

850
01:41:44,164 --> 01:41:46,325
You must not judge by this.

851
01:41:47,267 --> 01:41:49,895
Inside is a fit, young fellow...

852
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:52,938
...trying to escape his prison...

853
01:41:53,506 --> 01:41:56,805
...this white slug in which he's encased.

854
01:41:58,178 --> 01:41:59,770
He must be free...

855
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:02,348
...for freedom is his life.

856
01:42:06,619 --> 01:42:09,554
I've been following him about...

857
01:42:10,190 --> 01:42:12,317
...as he relived that life...

858
01:42:13,026 --> 01:42:17,690
...seeking out a special moment of reality.

859
01:42:19,132 --> 01:42:20,360
And did he find it?

860
01:42:21,034 --> 01:42:23,025
I'm not sure.

861
01:42:23,803 --> 01:42:25,100
Nor is he.

862
01:42:27,574 --> 01:42:29,804
I think he will go back again...

863
01:42:31,244 --> 01:42:35,237
...search yet one more time.

864
01:42:36,249 --> 01:42:39,377
Perhaps he will find it then.

865
01:42:41,054 --> 01:42:42,351
Reality...

866
01:42:44,490 --> 01:42:47,254
...whatever that may be.
