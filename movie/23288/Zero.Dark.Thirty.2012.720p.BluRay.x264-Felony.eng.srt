is not an exercise.</i>

get up to the cockpit?</i>

00:02:29,158 --> 00:02:30,735
I own you, Ammar.

41
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:33,420
You belong to me.

42
00:02:35,874 --> 00:02:37,089
Look at me.

43
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:42,716
You don't look at me when I
talk to you, I hurt you!

44
00:02:43,014 --> 00:02:45,170
You step off this
mat, I hurt you!

45
00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:49,560
If you lie to me, I'm gonna hurt you!
Now! Now, look at me!

46
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,994
Look at me, Ammar!

47
00:02:56,562 --> 00:02:57,288
Come on.

48
00:03:23,676 --> 00:03:25,706
- Nobody talks to him.
- Roger that.

49
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,317
Are we gonna board these
windows up or what?

50
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,548
Just off the plane
from Washington,

51
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:41,192
rocking your best suit for
your first interrogation,

52
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,708
and you get this guy.

53
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,732
- They're not always this intense.
- I'm fine.

54
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,511
Well, just so you know,

55
00:03:51,646 --> 00:03:55,135
it's gonna take a while. He has
to learn how helpless he is.

56
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:00,776
Come on, let's get a coffee.

57
00:04:01,244 --> 00:04:02,909
No, we should go back in.

58
00:04:10,097 --> 00:04:12,549
You know, it's no shame if you
wanna watch from the monitor.

59
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:17,959
All right.

60
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:24,489
Might wanna put this on.

61
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,337
You're not wearing one?

62
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,418
Is he ever getting out?

63
00:04:31,557 --> 00:04:32,532
Never.

64
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:34,151
Let's go.

65
00:04:48,826 --> 00:04:50,036
Right now,

66
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:52,622
all this is about, simply,

67
00:04:53,077 --> 00:04:56,267
is you coming to terms
with your situation.

68
00:04:57,312 --> 00:04:58,684
It's you and me, bro.

69
00:05:00,465 --> 00:05:02,717
I want you to understand
that I know you

70
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:08,509
that I've been studying and
following you for a very long time.

71
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,716
That I could've had you killed
in Karachi, but I didn't.

72
00:05:11,773 --> 00:05:14,987
I let you live, so that
you and I could talk.

73
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,074
Then you beat me when
my hands are tied.

74
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:20,850
So I won't talk to you.

75
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,969
Well, life isn't always
fair, my friend.

76
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:25,523
Did you really think...

77
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,487
that when we got you, "I would
get a nice fucking guy"?

78
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:33,709
You're a mid-level guy. You're a
garbageman in the corporation!

79
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,309
What should I respect you, huh?

80
00:05:36,517 --> 00:05:39,159
- Why?
- And you're a moneyman.

81
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:42,271
Paperboy.

82
00:05:42,835 --> 00:05:47,550
A disgrace to humanity. You and your
uncle murdered 3,000 innocent people.

83
00:05:49,327 --> 00:05:50,196
Yeah.

84
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:53,015
I have your name...

85
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:58,784
on a $5,000 transfer via Western
Union to a 9/11 hijacker.

86
00:06:01,307 --> 00:06:02,787
And you got popped...

87
00:06:02,952 --> 00:06:08,354
with 150 kilograms of high
explosives in your house!

88
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:12,896
And then you dare question me?

89
00:06:18,823 --> 00:06:20,223
Come on, man, I'm
fucking with you.

90
00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:24,493
No, I don't want to
talk about 9/11 yet.

91
00:06:26,538 --> 00:06:29,999
What I want to focus
on is the Saudi group.

92
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:39,051
That, there, is
Hazem al-Kashmiri.

93
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:42,358
And I know this dude is
up to some serious shit.

94
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,616
What I want from you
is his Saudi e-mail.

95
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:49,879
Ammar, bro, I know that
you know this dude.

96
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:52,488
Just give me his e-mail, and I
will-I will give you a blanket.

97
00:06:52,858 --> 00:06:55,095
I will give you a blanket
and some solid food.

98
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:01,983
I know that you know him.

99
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,663
I told you before, I
won't talk to you.

100
00:07:11,658 --> 00:07:13,122
Have it your way. Let's go.

101
00:07:15,262 --> 00:07:16,004
Come on.

102
00:07:19,391 --> 00:07:22,734
When you lie to me, I hurt you.

103
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:44,019
Grab me the bucket.

104
00:07:44,717 --> 00:07:46,424
- Huh?
- Grab the bucket.

105
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:54,085
Put some water in it.

106
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:57,741
Come on, let's go.

107
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:03,476
Come on, give it to me.

108
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:11,650
Hazem was a friend of Ramzi Yousef. You
guys met in Iran back in the nineties.

109
00:08:11,685 --> 00:08:13,448
I don't know!

110
00:08:16,072 --> 00:08:17,152
Fuck you!

111
00:08:22,947 --> 00:08:25,592
I want the e-mails of the
rest of the Saudi group.

112
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:29,004
Give me one e-mail and
I will stop this.

113
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:31,545
Who's in the Saudi group?

114
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,442
And what's the target?

115
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,032
Where was the last time
you saw bin Laden?

116
00:08:37,252 --> 00:08:40,656
Where was the last time
you saw bin Laden, huh?

117
00:08:41,503 --> 00:08:43,570
You know when you lie
to me, I hurt you.

118
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:55,835
This is what defeat
looks like, bro.

119
00:08:56,193 --> 00:08:57,781
Your jihad is over.

120
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:01,409
Get him up.

121
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:14,681
Try to understand
the concept here.

122
00:09:15,517 --> 00:09:17,344
Okay, I have time. You don't.

123
00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:20,082
I have other things
to do but you don't.

124
00:09:24,488 --> 00:09:27,634
It'-it's cool that you're strong.
I respect it, I do.

125
00:09:28,793 --> 00:09:33,123
But in the end, everybody breaks, bro.
That's biology.

126
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,455
Can you open the trunk, ma'am?

127
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:28,277
It's clear.

128
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,161
How'd it go the other night?

129
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,517
It was good. I mean the local cops
need a little tactical help, but...

130
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:25,203
he's tier-fucking-one, baby. That's
your money maker right there.

131
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:26,843
And this is the guy
that's KSM's nephew.

132
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:28,028
- Yeah.
- And what's his issue?

133
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:29,033
He's being a dick.

134
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:31,344
Well, if he's tying to outsmart you,
why don't you tell him about your PhD?

135
00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:33,972
Yeah. No, but I am gonna have to
turn up the heat on this asshole.

136
00:11:34,456 --> 00:11:36,190
He needs to give up
the Saudi group now.

137
00:11:36,277 --> 00:11:37,930
He's gotta have that,
given the family ties.

138
00:11:37,978 --> 00:11:40,811
He's tight with his uncle. He's got
his prints all over 9/11 money.

139
00:11:41,164 --> 00:11:43,335
He's got 'em in his head,
he needs to disclose 'em.

140
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:45,831
Good.

141
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:49,237
Bill, she's good to go. I'll get
her the right one tomorrow.

142
00:11:51,937 --> 00:11:53,388
Was I lying or what?

143
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,423
Uh, Maya, this is Joseph Bradley,
our illustrious station chief.

144
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,824
Joe and I did Iraq together.

145
00:11:59,878 --> 00:12:02,101
- It's nice to meet you.
- You too, sir.

146
00:12:02,483 --> 00:12:04,868
- How's your flight?
- Fine.

147
00:12:04,881 --> 00:12:07,642
Um, she's been having a great time
since she got in, isn't that right?

148
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:11,327
- Good. How do you like Pakistan so far?
- It's kinda fucked up.

149
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:14,835
- You volunteered for this, didn't you?
- No.

150
00:12:20,855 --> 00:12:22,636
Third floor, northeast corner.

151
00:12:29,722 --> 00:12:31,925
You don't think she's a little
young for the hard stuff?

152
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:35,581
- Washington says she's a killer.
- Hmm.

153
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:37,525
Children's crusade, huh?

154
00:12:37,562 --> 00:12:39,214
They wanna put the next
generation on the field.

155
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:41,179
Listen, I've got a meeting
with ISI in twenty minutes.

156
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,930
They're slow-rolling us on Lahore,
you might wanna bitch about that.

157
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:11,715
Did I tell you this?
That, uh, this dude

158
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:14,603
in Malaysia, tells a Malaysian
station that his nephew...

159
00:13:14,849 --> 00:13:17,638
- works with a guy, who knows a guy...
- Aww, here we go.

160
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:22,785
No, hold on. He goes to a big feast
in Bangkok, about a year ago.

161
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,236
Guest of honor: Osama bin Laden.

162
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:29,329
- Except if it was Tupac there...
- This is worth 5 million bucks.

163
00:13:29,338 --> 00:13:30,601
You know we gonna have
to chase it down.

164
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,769
He's like, "Hey, that's me, man.
No job too small."

165
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,795
That's why I have a gift
for you, my friend.

166
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,521
Everyone, Agent Maya.
Maya, everyone.

167
00:13:37,522 --> 00:13:39,295
Please don't ask her how
it's going with Ammar,

168
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:40,666
'cause she's not gonna
fucking tell you.

169
00:13:40,675 --> 00:13:42,454
Ammar is withholding.

170
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:47,257
Washington assesses Abu Faraj as
officially the new "Number 3".

171
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,765
He's the best man for it.

172
00:13:50,383 --> 00:13:51,172
Uh, yeah, the...

173
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:54,557
London station's already asking if
he's contacting anybody in the UK.

174
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,483
- Like we're just keeping it from them?
- Yeah.

175
00:13:56,784 --> 00:13:59,817
Jordanians are being really helpful
with Ammar's transit papers.

176
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,213
Any imminent threats in here?

177
00:14:01,315 --> 00:14:04,545
Oh, we've one on the consulate,
the Marriott, it's low-security.

178
00:14:04,555 --> 00:14:08,703
Um, and they've got Maj Khan talking
about, uh, gas stations in the US.

179
00:14:08,796 --> 00:14:10,431
And that's a conversation?

180
00:14:10,503 --> 00:14:14,413
Honestly, there's 600 questions in there.
I'd do Heathrow, the Saudis.

181
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:17,091
Does it matter what Faraj
thinks about Heathrow?

182
00:14:17,172 --> 00:14:18,973
How much latitude does
he get to pick targets?

183
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,318
Um, I think he'll give up the Saudis,
but Heathrow's gonna be tough.

184
00:14:21,388 --> 00:14:24,138
Anyway, uh... anything
from last night?

185
00:14:24,173 --> 00:14:26,448
Qatar Base Six have a bead
on the Arabs that escaped.

186
00:14:26,457 --> 00:14:29,668
They're meeting with ISI this afternoon,
hopefully set up a raid down there.

187
00:14:29,672 --> 00:14:30,432
Great.

188
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:34,689
And Lahore reporting, ISI was
painfully slow last night, again.

189
00:14:34,788 --> 00:14:36,576
They're beginning to think
it's not incompetence.

190
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:38,607
Okay, agree. I spoke to
the chief about that.

191
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,596
Yeah, anything on bin Laden?

192
00:14:40,635 --> 00:14:42,499
Uh, farmer on the Afghan
border near Tora Bora...

193
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:44,120
reports a diamond-shaped
pattern in the hills,

194
00:14:44,127 --> 00:14:46,450
tall male in the center of the
diamond, flanked by four guards,

195
00:14:46,515 --> 00:14:48,559
consistent with UBL's movements.

196
00:14:48,618 --> 00:14:49,989
That's supposed to
be his Royal Guard.

197
00:14:49,996 --> 00:14:51,921
No, that's pre-9/11 behavior.

198
00:14:52,427 --> 00:14:54,842
We have no reason to believe
he's changed security tactics.

199
00:14:54,918 --> 00:14:57,099
We invaded Afghanistan,
that's a reason.

200
00:14:59,902 --> 00:15:00,855
Hey, boss. I got a guy,

201
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:04,158
for 5,000 bucks, he can set up a
taxi stand, and snoop around a bit.

202
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:07,451
No, don't need him. Sorry, the
diamond sighting is bullshit.

203
00:15:07,686 --> 00:15:11,681
Uh, see if the Paks will send someone
to talk to the farmer. Anything else?

204
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:13,293
No?

205
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:16,795
All right, let's put some runs on
the board against Faraj, okay?

206
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,779
Talk to the case officers who didn't see
fit to make it today, and "thank" them.

207
00:15:22,482 --> 00:15:24,258
Tora Bora, yeah?

208
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:25,129
- Uh-huh.
- Good.

209
00:16:20,268 --> 00:16:21,769
Come on, here we go.

210
00:16:22,578 --> 00:16:23,436
Here we go.

211
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:33,266
All right, let's just, uh...
Let's take it easy today, huh?

212
00:16:55,109 --> 00:16:56,214
You hungry?

213
00:16:58,656 --> 00:17:00,674
Food in here sucks, so I
brought you some of this.

214
00:17:09,534 --> 00:17:10,564
Pretty good, huh?

215
00:17:21,354 --> 00:17:22,476
Richard Reid.

216
00:17:23,921 --> 00:17:25,653
Oh, man, I was
thinking about him.

217
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,723
The guy gets a bomb in a shoe on a plane.
Un-fucking-believable.

218
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:31,849
You know him, don't you?

219
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:37,498
Yes.

220
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:40,804
I'm glad you said that.

221
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:48,701
Okay, uh, I got an e-mail from you to
him, with all your comms for years, bro.

222
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,609
Who, um...

223
00:17:54,117 --> 00:17:55,953
Who else is in your Saudi group?

224
00:17:57,564 --> 00:18:00,168
I just handed out
some cash for them.

225
00:18:02,474 --> 00:18:04,838
I didn't know who the guys were.

226
00:18:08,231 --> 00:18:11,547
When you lie to me, I hurt you.

227
00:18:13,512 --> 00:18:14,821
Please.

228
00:18:23,445 --> 00:18:26,928
I believe you. I
do, I believe you.

229
00:18:32,104 --> 00:18:33,283
It's good, huh?

230
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,310
Do you want the water again?

231
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:43,953
Or do you want something else?

232
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:53,266
- Water?
- Please.

233
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:55,936
Just... give me a name.

234
00:18:58,328 --> 00:19:03,325
I don't know!

235
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,690
Come on, let's go!

236
00:19:07,431 --> 00:19:08,337
Bring him up.

237
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,642
Here we go.

238
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:12,033
You see how this works?

239
00:19:17,165 --> 00:19:20,005
You don't mind if my female colleague
here checks out your junk, do you?

240
00:19:20,365 --> 00:19:21,607
No? Good.

241
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:25,626
Dude, you shit your pants?

242
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:28,908
You stay here, I'll be back.

243
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,143
Your friend is an animal.

244
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:49,491
Please, help me.

245
00:19:51,286 --> 00:19:52,360
Please.

246
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,245
You can help yourself
by being truthful.

247
00:20:14,408 --> 00:20:15,744
This is a dog collar.

248
00:20:20,138 --> 00:20:24,331
- No!
- Hang on.

249
00:20:29,413 --> 00:20:31,190
You determine how I treat you.

250
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:38,832
Come on.

251
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:43,569
I got you.

252
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,152
Come on.

253
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,301
Come on.

254
00:20:55,274 --> 00:20:56,824
You're my dog, I gotta walk you.

255
00:20:58,771 --> 00:21:00,572
What the fuck do you think
is going on, Ammar?

256
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:04,662
Walid has already told
me that you know, hmm?

257
00:21:07,713 --> 00:21:10,381
Here we go.

258
00:21:11,992 --> 00:21:15,296
This box here. This box sucks.

259
00:21:16,724 --> 00:21:18,046
And I'm gonna put you in it.

260
00:21:23,497 --> 00:21:24,827
When is the attack?

261
00:21:27,865 --> 00:21:29,460
When is the attack?

262
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,642
- S...
- What?

263
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:36,033
- What?
- "Ahad. " (Sunday)

264
00:21:37,638 --> 00:21:39,898
Sunday, where? Whoa...
Sunday, where?

265
00:21:41,772 --> 00:21:43,936
Sunday. This Sunday
or next Sunday?

266
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:48,016
Where?

267
00:21:50,731 --> 00:21:51,709
What?

268
00:21:54,197 --> 00:21:56,658
Come on, Ammar, is
it Sunday or Monday?

269
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,727
Partial information will
be treated as a lie.

270
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,197
Come on, let's go.

271
00:22:01,973 --> 00:22:03,450
Come on, which day is it?

272
00:22:03,951 --> 00:22:06,769
Partial information... You
gonna go in the box, huh?

273
00:22:06,874 --> 00:22:11,091
Partial information is treated as a lie!
Let's go!

274
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:15,177
- Saturday!
- In the box you go!

275
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:17,677
- Sunday!
- Almost.

276
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,225
Monday!

277
00:22:21,065 --> 00:22:24,745
- Tuesday!
- Huh? There we go.

278
00:22:24,753 --> 00:22:27,576
- Friday!
- Come on, let's go! Come on!

279
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:32,319
- Hang on...
- Sunday.

280
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:37,620
- Monday.
- Shh...

281
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,378
Thursd...

282
00:22:41,135 --> 00:22:43,540
Ammar, which day is it?

283
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:45,573
Which day?

284
00:22:51,158 --> 00:22:52,196
Frid...

285
00:22:54,868 --> 00:22:57,930
- Ammar, which day?
- Thursd...

286
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:02,188
Frid...

287
00:23:20,485 --> 00:23:21,846
"Yalla! Yalla!
Yalla!" (Let's go!)

288
00:23:25,608 --> 00:23:26,859
"Yalla! Yalla! Yalla!"

289
00:23:28,913 --> 00:23:32,117
<i>attack against westerners
and foreigners.</i>

290
00:23:32,152 --> 00:23:34,335
<i>When you look at the
break-up of casualties,</i>

291
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:39,214
<i>you can see that non-muslims were
killed, and so were Americans...</i>

292
00:23:39,636 --> 00:23:42,156
You don't worry about the Saudis,
they'll take care of business.

293
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:43,825
Yeah, now.

294
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:47,695
You warned them, they
didn't take you seriously.

295
00:23:47,701 --> 00:23:49,497
This is what happens.
It's not on you.

296
00:23:49,509 --> 00:23:51,531
Oh, and who said that, huh?
Zayid? Fuck him.

297
00:23:51,544 --> 00:23:53,576
This is on me. Ammar is on me,

298
00:23:53,589 --> 00:23:56,486
- and it's on her. And, we do not,
- No, no, no. Now, you had what, days?

299
00:23:56,499 --> 00:23:59,119
- We cannot let this be a win-win for AQ.
- Brief custody, unresponsive ally.

300
00:23:59,126 --> 00:24:00,557
The way you do this,
is look ahead.

301
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:03,370
London, Heathrow, mass casualties.
The plan is still active.

302
00:24:03,464 --> 00:24:05,358
Ammar doesn't have a clue
about what happened.

303
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,218
- Oh, he knows.
- How?

304
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:10,528
Oh, you have to be really careful with
people in KSM's circle, they're devious.

305
00:24:10,735 --> 00:24:12,777
He's not gonna talk about
attacks in the homeland.

306
00:24:12,778 --> 00:24:15,933
He's gonna withhold operational
details on the KSM network...

307
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:17,970
and probably bin Laden.

308
00:24:18,775 --> 00:24:20,371
But he's been in
complete isolation.

309
00:24:20,406 --> 00:24:22,855
He doesn't know we've failed.
We could tell him anything.

310
00:24:23,325 --> 00:24:24,351
What? Bluff him?

311
00:24:25,249 --> 00:24:27,701
He hasn't slept in.
He's clueless.

312
00:24:33,674 --> 00:24:35,017
You don't remember, do you?

313
00:24:35,451 --> 00:24:38,269
Well, short-term memory loss is a
side effect of sleep deprivation,

314
00:24:38,273 --> 00:24:39,699
so it should come back to you.

315
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:44,414
I don't know.

316
00:24:46,305 --> 00:24:47,894
How can I remember?

317
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:51,017
After we kept you awake
for 96 hours you

318
00:24:51,729 --> 00:24:53,155
gave us the names of
some of your brothers,

319
00:24:53,247 --> 00:24:56,196
and you helped save the lives
of a lot of innocent people.

320
00:24:56,702 --> 00:24:59,022
Which is a smart thing to do when
you're starting to think for yourself.

321
00:24:59,173 --> 00:24:59,914
Mm-hm.

322
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,844
Come on, eat up, man.

323
00:25:01,912 --> 00:25:07,900
Some hummus, tabbouleh, don't know what
that is, some figs. You earned it.

324
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:17,258
So uh you flew via
Amman to Kabul, yeah?

325
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,257
Hang out with your uncle.

326
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,192
Mukhtar.

327
00:25:23,718 --> 00:25:26,775
- How did you know that?
- I told you, man, I know you.

328
00:25:28,107 --> 00:25:30,041
All right, you got me.
You did, you got me.

329
00:25:30,574 --> 00:25:32,175
Flight manifests.

330
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:36,058
It must be pretty fucked up
for you guys after 9/11.

331
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:39,656
And what did you do, um, what
did you do after the invasion?

332
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,566
Before you went back to Pesh?

333
00:25:42,237 --> 00:25:44,762
After 9/11, we had to choose.

334
00:25:45,276 --> 00:25:47,734
Fight to protect
our turf or run.

335
00:25:47,778 --> 00:25:49,713
And you chose to fight, yeah?

336
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:53,634
We wanted to kill Americans.

337
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,029
Yeah.

338
00:25:55,573 --> 00:26:00,359
We tried to get into Tora Bora, but the
bombing was too high. We couldn't cross.

339
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,582
I'm sorry, who's the
"we" in that sentence?

340
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,672
Me, and some other guys who were
hanging around at that time.

341
00:26:10,317 --> 00:26:12,282
You know, I can always go and
eat with some other dude,

342
00:26:12,295 --> 00:26:14,047
hang you back up to the ceiling.

343
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:19,186
Hamza Rabia.

344
00:26:25,498 --> 00:26:27,005
Khabab al-Masri.

345
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:34,456
And Abu Ahmed.

346
00:26:39,582 --> 00:26:41,782
Who's Abu Ahmed? I've
heard of the other guys.

347
00:26:42,317 --> 00:26:44,847
He was a computer guy
with us at the time.

348
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:52,591
After Tora Bora, I went
back to Pesh, as you know.

349
00:26:52,633 --> 00:26:53,560
Mm-hm.

350
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:56,877
And they went north,
I think, to Kunar.

351
00:26:56,909 --> 00:26:58,226
What's his family name?

352
00:26:59,027 --> 00:27:01,117
Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti.

353
00:27:02,977 --> 00:27:06,487
Abu Ahmed means "father
of Ahmed", it's a kunya.

354
00:27:07,507 --> 00:27:10,703
Ammar, I know the difference between
a war name and an Arabic name.

355
00:27:10,772 --> 00:27:11,909
She got you there, dude.

356
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,766
I swear to you both, I don't
know his family name.

357
00:27:17,723 --> 00:27:19,974
I would have never asked
him something like that.

358
00:27:19,987 --> 00:27:22,248
It's not how my uncle worked.

359
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:23,136
I know.

360
00:27:24,845 --> 00:27:27,513
My uncle told me he
worked for bin Laden.

361
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:35,501
Um, I did see him, once, about
a year ago, in Karachi.

362
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:43,518
He read us all a letter
from the "Sheik".

363
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:45,108
A letter?

364
00:27:45,644 --> 00:27:46,713
What'd it say?

365
00:27:47,446 --> 00:27:48,315
Cigarette?

366
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:02,023
It said, "Continue the jihad."

367
00:28:03,118 --> 00:28:06,354
"The work will go on
for a hundred years."

368
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:15,489
<i>You and I are gonna talk about some of
the guys at the training camps, yeah?</i>

369
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:16,532
<i>Okay.</i>

370
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:20,209
<i>Some of these brothers
have done some bad things.</i>

371
00:28:20,228 --> 00:28:24,828
<i>What I wanna do is, I wanna separate
them from the people like you.</i>

372
00:28:24,831 --> 00:28:26,450
<i>Definitely, yeah.</i>

373
00:28:26,546 --> 00:28:31,030
<i>All right, a guy called
Abu Ahmed, from Kuwait.</i>

374
00:28:31,065 --> 00:28:33,611
<i>Yes, I remember him.
The nice guy.</i>

375
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:36,884
<i>How close was he? What was his
relationship to the leadership?</i>

376
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:37,985
<i>I don't know.</i>

377
00:28:38,014 --> 00:28:38,781
<i>Did he eat with you guys?</i>

378
00:28:38,837 --> 00:28:40,835
<i>Did he eat with the good guys, or
did he eat with the leadership?</i>

379
00:28:40,931 --> 00:28:43,159
<i>I don't know, sir. I
have no idea about it.</i>

380
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:45,466
<i>That's something you don't
need an idea about.</i>

381
00:28:49,245 --> 00:28:53,516
<i>When you met Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,
was this one of the facilitators?</i>

382
00:28:55,185 --> 00:28:57,059
<i>Is this Abu Ahmed?</i>

383
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:08,505
<i>- KSM, your boss.
- Mukhtar.</i>

384
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,952
<i>"Mukhtar"... "Potato"...</i>

385
00:29:09,987 --> 00:29:13,842
<i>You say, "Po-tah-to"; I say, "Fucking
KSM"; You say, "Mukhtar", okay?</i>

386
00:29:13,892 --> 00:29:17,232
<i>Now, after Mukhtar was captured,
what did Abu Ahmed do?</i>

387
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:22,203
<i>Abu Ahmed. I believe... I believe,
he went to work for the "Sheik".</i>

388
00:29:46,738 --> 00:29:47,555
<i>Is that him?</i>

389
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:52,906
<i>- Say it.
- Abu Ahmed.</i>

390
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,948
<i>- Say it again.
- Abu Ahmed.</i>

391
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:59,251
<i>Abu Ahmed.</i>

392
00:30:02,076 --> 00:30:03,369
<i>Abu Ahmed.</i>

393
00:30:40,243 --> 00:30:42,312
How's the needle
in the haystack?

394
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:44,702
Fine.

395
00:30:46,608 --> 00:30:47,921
Facilitators come and go.

396
00:30:47,922 --> 00:30:51,388
One thing you can count on in life
is that everyone wants money.

397
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:55,709
You're assuming that al-Qaeda members
are motivated by financial rewards.

398
00:30:56,015 --> 00:30:57,137
They're radicals.

399
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:01,110
Correct. You're
assuming that, uh,

400
00:31:01,162 --> 00:31:04,742
greed won't override ideology
in some of the weaker members.

401
00:31:04,848 --> 00:31:07,890
Money for walk-ins worked great in
the Cold War, I'll give you that.

402
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:09,645
Thank you.

403
00:31:49,623 --> 00:31:51,402
He says it looks like Abu Ahmed.

404
00:31:52,217 --> 00:31:53,495
Who did he work for?

405
00:32:03,418 --> 00:32:07,398
He was mostly with Abu Faraj.
They were always together.

406
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:09,448
What did he do for Faraj?

407
00:32:17,654 --> 00:32:20,047
He carried messages from
Abu Faraj to bin Laden,

408
00:32:20,055 --> 00:32:22,012
from bin Laden
back to Abu Faraj.

409
00:32:22,305 --> 00:32:24,766
We need to ask him something to
see if he's telling the truth.

410
00:32:24,785 --> 00:32:26,619
We don't know if he
really knew Faraj.

411
00:32:38,843 --> 00:32:42,192
He just told me the names of
all of Abu Faraj's children.

412
00:32:42,941 --> 00:32:44,627
I think he's telling the truth.

413
00:32:47,709 --> 00:32:50,170
Twenty detainees recognized
that photo of Abu Ahmed.

414
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:51,404
They say he's part of
an inner circle...

415
00:32:51,423 --> 00:32:54,061
of guys that was hanging out
in Afghanistan pre-9/11.

416
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:57,214
A lot of them say that after
9/11, he went to work for KSM.

417
00:32:57,243 --> 00:32:59,689
When KSM was captured, he
went to work for Abu Faraj.

418
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:02,708
Primarily as a courier,
from Faraj to bin Laden.

419
00:33:03,015 --> 00:33:04,447
That's good, but you
still don't have...

420
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,213
Yeah, but we don't know if Abu's
on the outside of the network.

421
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:07,458
A series of cut-outs
and dead drops,

422
00:33:07,493 --> 00:33:10,241
or if he has a direct
connection to bin Laden.

423
00:33:10,346 --> 00:33:12,290
I mean, does bin Laden invite
him into the living room,

424
00:33:12,308 --> 00:33:15,088
and hand him a letter directly,
or is Abu just the last guy...

425
00:33:15,092 --> 00:33:17,376
in a long line of couriers, and
that's why everybody knows him.

426
00:33:17,388 --> 00:33:19,623
That's not all you don't know.
You don't have his real name.

427
00:33:19,642 --> 00:33:22,266
- You don't have a clue of where he is.
- Yes, but we know that he's important.

428
00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:24,249
The fact that everybody's
heard of Abu Ahmed,

429
00:33:24,257 --> 00:33:26,849
but nobody will tell me
where he is, suggests that.

430
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:28,611
Maybe.

431
00:33:28,954 --> 00:33:31,302
Detainees can withhold his location
for any number of reasons.

432
00:33:31,307 --> 00:33:32,451
Perhaps they don't know.

433
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,323
Perhaps this "Abu" is actually a cover
story and he's really a fucking unicorn.

434
00:33:36,677 --> 00:33:39,723
But the withholding doesn't reveal
what you want it to, does it?

435
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:42,582
No.

436
00:33:43,303 --> 00:33:46,068
And if you did find him, you don't
know that he'd be with bin Laden.

437
00:33:46,086 --> 00:33:47,500
We don't know what
we don't know.

438
00:33:47,535 --> 00:33:49,303
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

439
00:33:52,137 --> 00:33:53,298
It's tautology.

440
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:59,634
Listen, not one single detainee has said
that he's been located with the big guy.

441
00:33:59,647 --> 00:34:01,880
Just that he delivers
messages, am I wrong?

442
00:34:03,091 --> 00:34:05,071
No.

443
00:34:07,773 --> 00:34:11,581
It's still good work. Let me know when
you've got some actual intelligence.

444
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,685
Preferably, something
that leads to a strike.

445
00:34:53,285 --> 00:34:55,933
<i>This is what remains of the No.
10 bus,</i>

446
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:59,603
<i>which was travelling through Tavistock
Square, near Euston station.</i>

447
00:35:00,138 --> 00:35:05,316
<i>There'd been explosions near Liverpool
Street and Edgware Road stations too.</i>

448
00:35:05,743 --> 00:35:08,221
<i>Dozens of the survivors
were critically injured,</i>

449
00:35:08,222 --> 00:35:11,607
<i>but many of the wounded were also
keen to share their stories.</i>

450
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,749
<i>We just pulled out
of Edgware Road,</i>

451
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:19,673
<i>and next thing I know, is a
loud, um, large flash of light.</i>

452
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:23,953
<i>Uh, I felt a burning sensation on my
hands, put my hands up to my face...</i>

453
00:35:25,009 --> 00:35:27,700
<i>Uh, I was on the floor
by that point...</i>

454
00:35:29,176 --> 00:35:31,195
<i>Yeah, I can't recall anything
prior to that anymore.</i>

455
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:33,237
<i>Any noise, any bang...</i>

456
00:35:33,258 --> 00:35:37,657
<i>Normal life in one of the busiest parts
of the capital has now been suspended.</i>

457
00:35:37,685 --> 00:35:41,558
<i>Just a few yards down the road here,
they continue to care for the injured.</i>

458
00:35:41,587 --> 00:35:46,462
<i>And all around, groups of Londoners are
standing on corners, asking themselves,</i>

459
00:35:46,463 --> 00:35:49,796
<i>"What has happened here, and who
could possibly have done this?"</i>

460
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:56,824
Come on.

461
00:36:06,024 --> 00:36:07,318
You too, come on.

462
00:36:18,475 --> 00:36:20,019
You agency guys are twisted.

463
00:36:21,474 --> 00:36:22,823
Detainee's ready for you.

464
00:36:29,656 --> 00:36:31,434
Come on. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa...

465
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:56,199
I want you to understand
that I know you

466
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:59,666
I've been following you, and
studying you, for a long time.

467
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,151
I chased you in Lahore.

468
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:02,903
I had you picked up
instead of killing you,

469
00:37:02,939 --> 00:37:05,977
because you're not a violent man,
and you don't deserve to die.

470
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,402
Thank you.

471
00:37:07,775 --> 00:37:10,778
But you do have deep ties to
al-Qaeda I want to ask you about,

472
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:14,434
before you get sent to your next
location, which might be Israel.

473
00:37:14,802 --> 00:37:17,585
However, depending on how
candid you are here today,

474
00:37:18,549 --> 00:37:20,788
I may be able to keep
you in Pakistan.

475
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,292
What do you want to know?

476
00:37:23,837 --> 00:37:27,346
I'm gonna ask you a series of questions,
based on your knowledge of al-Qaeda,

477
00:37:27,381 --> 00:37:30,308
and your position as key
financier for the organization.

478
00:37:30,469 --> 00:37:32,268
I have dealt with the horrors.

479
00:37:33,362 --> 00:37:37,969
I have no wish to be tortured again.
Ask me a question, I will answer it.

480
00:37:38,475 --> 00:37:41,275
What can you tell me about
Atiyah Abdul-Rahman?

481
00:37:42,424 --> 00:37:47,306
He works for Zawahiri. He's in
charge of military tactics.

482
00:37:48,368 --> 00:37:51,588
In what context have you ever
heard the name Abu Ahmed?

483
00:37:54,650 --> 00:38:00,092
He works for Faraj and bin Laden.
He is his most trusted courier.

484
00:38:02,578 --> 00:38:04,071
What makes you say that?

485
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:06,824
He brought me many
messages from the "Sheik".

486
00:38:13,032 --> 00:38:15,020
Where did you last see
him, and where is he now?

487
00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:20,035
- You will never find him.
- Why is that?

488
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:24,530
Even I couldn't find him. He always
contacted me out of the blue.

489
00:38:26,402 --> 00:38:28,528
He's one of "the
disappeared ones".

490
00:41:02,971 --> 00:41:05,435
You're in luck, I got you
a one-on-one with Faraj.

491
00:41:06,104 --> 00:41:07,429
Seriously? Thank you.

492
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:09,778
Don't you thank me until you
hear what I want for it.

493
00:41:09,906 --> 00:41:12,585
I want you to take care of all
this before your favorite subject.

494
00:41:12,616 --> 00:41:13,497
Deal.

495
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,922
Don't you wanna see
whats in the folder?

496
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:24,311
You want family ties, financial networks
media sources, disgruntled employees,

497
00:41:24,312 --> 00:41:27,839
imminent threats, homeland plots,
foreign sales, health status,

498
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,687
financial resources, tradecraft,
recruiting tactics, anything else?

499
00:41:31,806 --> 00:41:34,184
- No, I think that covers it.
- Yeah.

500
00:41:36,421 --> 00:41:37,198
Huh?

501
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,521
"What they say is true. The Shaolin
and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous."

502
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:46,478
What do you like to be called?
"Faraj", "Fareej", "Buzzie"?

503
00:41:47,212 --> 00:41:49,373
C'mon, dude, what do you like?
You like a bit of, uh...

504
00:41:50,026 --> 00:41:52,100
You guys like a bit of Bob
Marley, with the Reggae?

505
00:41:53,098 --> 00:41:55,299
Kick back, take it easy after
you've blown some shit up?

506
00:41:55,867 --> 00:41:56,793
Huh?

507
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,094
No?

508
00:42:00,398 --> 00:42:02,120
Got some Libyan music you like?

509
00:42:10,035 --> 00:42:11,585
You did the UK bombings, right?

510
00:42:13,117 --> 00:42:16,915
Well, you're the second "Number
3" I've captured. I got KSM.

511
00:42:25,298 --> 00:42:26,611
Can I be honest with you?

512
00:42:29,051 --> 00:42:30,734
I'm bad fuckin' news.

513
00:42:32,547 --> 00:42:33,690
I'm not your friend.

514
00:42:35,187 --> 00:42:36,335
Not gonna help you.

515
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:39,696
I'm gonna break you.

516
00:42:41,842 --> 00:42:43,128
Any questions?

517
00:42:44,556 --> 00:42:45,323
No?

518
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:49,433
All right, you haven't eaten in 18 hours.
We need to keep your energy up.

519
00:42:49,822 --> 00:42:50,862
You hungry?

520
00:42:57,806 --> 00:42:59,233
A lot of brothers told us,

521
00:42:59,268 --> 00:43:03,122
Abu Ahmed was Bin Laden's courier, and
that he worked very closely with you.

522
00:43:04,037 --> 00:43:07,141
You are thinking of Abu Khaled.

523
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:13,120
- Who?
- Al-Baluchi, my courier for the "Sheik".

524
00:43:15,368 --> 00:43:19,621
Okay, so you're telling me, all
the other brothers are wrong.

525
00:43:19,734 --> 00:43:23,271
And there's some famous "Baluchi"
guy, working for you and bin Laden,

526
00:43:23,306 --> 00:43:24,982
that I've never even heard of.

527
00:43:25,404 --> 00:43:28,834
- Why should you have heard of him?
- What does this Baluchi guy look like?

528
00:43:29,734 --> 00:43:32,601
Tall. Long white beard.

529
00:43:33,867 --> 00:43:38,449
- Thin. He uses a cane.
- Kinda like Gandalf.

530
00:43:39,726 --> 00:43:40,544
Who?

531
00:43:41,759 --> 00:43:43,667
When was the last
time you saw him?

532
00:43:44,234 --> 00:43:47,523
A month ago, in Karachi.

533
00:43:47,686 --> 00:43:53,162
But I don't know where he is now.
Sometimes, I wouldn't even see him.

534
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:58,020
He would just tell me, where
to leave the messages.

535
00:44:01,422 --> 00:44:03,644
You're not being fulsome
in your replies.

536
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:07,261
You cannot force me to tell
you something I don't know.

537
00:44:07,296 --> 00:44:11,562
You do realize this is not a normal prison?
You determine how you're treated.

538
00:44:11,597 --> 00:44:13,928
And your life is gonna be
very uncomfortable, until...

539
00:44:13,963 --> 00:44:16,587
you give me the
information I need!

540
00:44:18,566 --> 00:44:22,431
Where exactly is Abu Ahmed
living at the moment?

541
00:44:34,183 --> 00:44:37,242
Faraj is completely denying
knowing Abu Ahmed.

542
00:44:39,701 --> 00:44:41,701
That's using every
measure we have.

543
00:44:41,836 --> 00:44:43,102
Well, he's either gonna
keep withholding

544
00:44:43,235 --> 00:44:45,555
or he's gonna die from the
presssure you're putting on him.

545
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:49,505
Hey, you wanna
take a run at him?

546
00:44:51,435 --> 00:44:52,268
No.

547
00:44:53,169 --> 00:44:54,078
No?

548
00:44:54,549 --> 00:44:56,712
- No.
- Since when? No.

549
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:00,310
You know, I was meaning to tell
you, I'm getting outta here.

550
00:45:02,436 --> 00:45:05,337
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just...

551
00:45:06,346 --> 00:45:08,268
You know, I think I've
seen too many guys naked.

552
00:45:09,969 --> 00:45:11,470
It's gotta be over a fucking
hundred at this point.

553
00:45:11,568 --> 00:45:13,635
I need to go and do something
normal for a while.

554
00:45:15,235 --> 00:45:16,502
Like what?

555
00:45:17,069 --> 00:45:20,714
I'll go to Washington, do the dance,
see how that environment works.

556
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:23,422
You should come with me.

557
00:45:24,168 --> 00:45:26,936
Yeah, be my number two. You're looking
a little strung out yourself.

558
00:45:29,402 --> 00:45:31,736
I'm not gonna find
Abu Ahmed from DC.

559
00:45:39,401 --> 00:45:40,869
They killed my monkeys.

560
00:45:42,601 --> 00:45:45,435
Some bullshit about escaping,
you fucking believe that?

561
00:45:49,502 --> 00:45:51,036
Sorry, Dan.

562
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:56,104
Look, Maya, you gotta be real
careful with the detainees now.

563
00:45:56,469 --> 00:45:58,387
Okay, politics are changing,
and you don't wanna be...

564
00:45:58,412 --> 00:46:01,711
the last one holding a dog collar,
when the Oversight Committee comes.

565
00:46:02,803 --> 00:46:04,203
- I know.
- Yeah?

566
00:46:05,736 --> 00:46:07,791
And watch your back when
you get back to Pakistan.

567
00:46:07,804 --> 00:46:09,869
Everyone knows you there now.

568
00:47:02,703 --> 00:47:05,770
Sorry. Fucking checkpoints.

569
00:47:07,337 --> 00:47:08,838
- Maya?
- Yeah?

570
00:47:09,536 --> 00:47:11,669
We're socializing. Be social.

571
00:47:13,936 --> 00:47:15,003
Okay.

572
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:23,370
Look, I know Abu Ahmed is your baby, but
it is time to cut the umbilical cord.

573
00:47:23,469 --> 00:47:26,672
- No, it's not.
- So Faraj went south on you, it happens.

574
00:47:26,707 --> 00:47:28,651
There are still cells
in London and Spain,

575
00:47:28,686 --> 00:47:30,366
who are planning the
next round of attacks.

576
00:47:31,237 --> 00:47:33,304
I could work on it
at the same time.

577
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:36,137
Plus, I think it's a
good thing he lied.

578
00:47:36,171 --> 00:47:39,738
No, not at the expense of protecting
the homeland, you can't...

579
00:47:39,904 --> 00:47:41,424
Wait a minute. Why
is it a good thing?

580
00:47:41,537 --> 00:47:44,138
You sound just like Bradley. He
doesn't believe in my lead either.

581
00:47:48,774 --> 00:47:49,769
It's a good thing,

582
00:47:50,237 --> 00:47:53,970
because the fact that Faraj withheld
on Abu Ahmed is very revealing.

583
00:47:54,345 --> 00:47:58,186
The only other thing Faraj lied about,
was the location of bin Laden himself.

584
00:47:58,529 --> 00:48:03,283
That means Faraj thinks Abu Ahmed's just
as important to protect as bin Laden.

585
00:48:04,866 --> 00:48:08,311
- That confirms my lead.
- Or it's confirmation bias.

586
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:09,679
Mmm...

587
00:48:12,595 --> 00:48:15,426
We're just worried about you, okay?
Is that okay to say?

588
00:48:16,003 --> 00:48:18,930
I mean, look how
run-down you are.

589
00:48:26,266 --> 00:48:28,173
Where's Jack?

590
00:48:28,694 --> 00:48:30,641
Probably stuck in some
checkpoint, somewhere.

591
00:48:32,068 --> 00:48:33,399
You two hooked up yet?

592
00:48:33,796 --> 00:48:38,230
Hello, I work with him. I'm not that
girl that fucks. It's unbecoming.

593
00:48:39,528 --> 00:48:41,850
So, a little fooling
around wouldn't hurt you.

594
00:48:43,033 --> 00:48:44,397
Hmph...

595
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:47,737
- So, no boyfriend?
- Mm-mm.

596
00:48:49,548 --> 00:48:51,419
You got any friends at all?

597
00:48:57,733 --> 00:48:58,591
That's Jack.

598
00:48:59,827 --> 00:49:00,701
Hey.

599
00:49:01,899 --> 00:49:03,042
That's okay.

600
00:49:22,922 --> 00:49:23,625
Come on!

601
00:49:28,568 --> 00:49:29,421
Come on!

602
00:49:46,606 --> 00:49:47,361
Go!

603
00:49:48,623 --> 00:49:49,768
Come on, over here!

604
00:50:04,105 --> 00:50:09,238
<i>The blast left a crater, 10 meters or
30 feet wide, in front of the hotel.</i>

605
00:50:09,405 --> 00:50:13,471
<i>Police tell CNN, the driver of the truck
bomb tried to talk his way pass...</i>

606
00:50:13,506 --> 00:50:17,124
<i>the hotel's steel security gate.
When armed guards said no,</i>

607
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:21,480
<i>police said, the driver detonated
more than 2,000 pounds of explosives.</i>

608
00:50:21,515 --> 00:50:25,594
<i>The Marriott, one of the most popular
destinations for locals and westerners..</i>

609
00:50:25,629 --> 00:50:28,513
<i>In Islamabad, now destroyed.</i>

610
00:50:57,798 --> 00:50:59,320
The Jords have a mole.

611
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:00,831
What?

612
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,847
He made this video to
prove his bona fides.

613
00:51:03,672 --> 00:51:05,289
Shut up.

614
00:51:06,143 --> 00:51:09,818
Humam Khalil al-Balawi.
He's a Jordanian doctor.

615
00:51:11,854 --> 00:51:13,845
He's right there in
the inner circle.

616
00:51:15,962 --> 00:51:18,640
I don't buy it. Didn't you tell me
yourself, nobody turns on al-Qaeda?

617
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:21,271
The Jordans have worked him for a year,
dinners, money. They convinced him...

618
00:51:21,306 --> 00:51:24,849
it's his patriotic duty to turn on
al-Qaeda, and get rich doing it.

619
00:51:24,884 --> 00:51:27,456
- Yeah, well, so the Jords say.
- Yeah, you're right.

620
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:31,266
We can't rely on this or the Jords.
We've gotta evaluate him face-to-face.

621
00:51:31,301 --> 00:51:33,237
He may not be that smart,
he may be full of shit.

622
00:51:33,272 --> 00:51:34,966
But we have to talk
to him and find out.

623
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:36,876
The key is to meet him,

624
00:51:36,911 --> 00:51:39,231
so we can figure out for ourselves
what he can actually do.

625
00:51:48,419 --> 00:51:50,648
He really asked for
a dialysis machine?

626
00:51:53,532 --> 00:51:55,526
Maybe we can fill the
damn thing with poison.

627
00:52:03,562 --> 00:52:06,998
The meeting with Balawi is off.
He can't come to Islamabad.

628
00:52:07,073 --> 00:52:11,691
- Can't or won't?
- He's not gonna travel. Security risk.

629
00:52:13,264 --> 00:52:16,373
<i>And, uh, I've said repeatedly,
that America doesn't torture.</i>

630
00:52:16,572 --> 00:52:18,616
<i>And I'm gonna make sure
that we don't torture.</i>

631
00:52:18,629 --> 00:52:20,684
<i>Those are part
and parcel of...</i>

632
00:52:20,974 --> 00:52:26,973
<i>an-an effort to regain, uh, America's
moral stature in the world.</i>

633
00:52:27,073 --> 00:52:28,541
<i>Can you give us some sense
of when you might start...</i>

634
00:52:28,706 --> 00:52:31,922
He... wants us to go to him.

635
00:52:32,124 --> 00:52:36,092
He'll meet us in Maidan
Shar with the Tribals.

636
00:52:36,877 --> 00:52:38,757
He knows you're white,
we'd get kidnapped there.

637
00:52:38,782 --> 00:52:43,905
Could we do it somewhere else? Germany?
In the UK? He's got a clean passport.

638
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:46,871
He's not gonna travel out
of al-Qaeda territory.

639
00:52:46,974 --> 00:52:49,605
- And you're not going to him.
- I'm not, believe me.

640
00:52:51,165 --> 00:52:52,296
We're stuck.

641
00:52:55,942 --> 00:53:01,482
What about Camp Chapman... Afghanistan?
That can be safe territory.

642
00:53:11,202 --> 00:53:14,475
This may be going overboard,
but I baked him a cake.

643
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:17,947
<i>Muslims don't
celebrate with cake.</i>

644
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:20,708
Don't be so literal,
everyone likes cake.

645
00:53:20,773 --> 00:53:23,440
<i>It's not too late for you to
come, you know, it'll be fun.</i>

646
00:53:23,506 --> 00:53:25,773
No, I don't want to
be a straphanger.

647
00:53:26,033 --> 00:53:28,641
It's your show. You were the first
to see the potential in this.

648
00:53:28,673 --> 00:53:32,099
<i>Oh, come on, we've
got lots of wine.</i>

649
00:53:32,602 --> 00:53:34,242
Cool, bring me back a bottle.

650
00:53:35,441 --> 00:53:36,708
<i>That, I will do.</i>

651
00:53:38,513 --> 00:53:39,700
Not to get technical,

652
00:53:40,789 --> 00:53:44,370
but this guy is actually the first
big break we've had since 9/11.

653
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:48,507
To big breaks, and the little
people that make 'em happen.

654
00:53:52,085 --> 00:53:55,886
So far, everything he's said, we've
cross-checked, and it's proved legit.

655
00:53:56,436 --> 00:53:59,638
And I think the money
is persuasive.

656
00:54:00,807 --> 00:54:03,530
25 million dollars?

657
00:54:05,131 --> 00:54:06,690
That buy's a new life.

658
00:54:08,193 --> 00:54:10,443
Do you think he might be
exaggerating his access?

659
00:54:11,244 --> 00:54:12,340
Possibly.

660
00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:17,244
But, al-Qaeda needs doctors, and
they are short-staffed, and...

661
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:19,645
that could explain his rise.

662
00:54:21,064 --> 00:54:22,503
In six months to a year,

663
00:54:22,824 --> 00:54:27,387
if he doesn't fuck up, he could
be called in to treat bin Laden.

664
00:54:29,337 --> 00:54:33,774
At that moment, with 25 mill on the
table, I think he gives up the big man.

665
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:36,933
And if he doesn't, we kill him.

666
00:54:50,766 --> 00:54:51,844
- John.
- Yeah.

667
00:54:52,249 --> 00:54:54,675
When he arrives, let me set the
tone, and then I'll flip it to you,

668
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:57,341
and you can talk about
asset protection.

669
00:54:57,507 --> 00:54:59,108
- Roger that.
- Uh, Lauren,

670
00:55:00,679 --> 00:55:05,321
I know you wanna get some questions in
there, but give Balawi a little time.

671
00:55:05,356 --> 00:55:09,112
After John speaks, we'll cover the
basics, have his birthday cake,

672
00:55:09,147 --> 00:55:10,938
then we'll get into
the nitty-gritty.

673
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:15,757
Is that order okay? Or d-do
you wanna introduce everyone?

674
00:55:15,792 --> 00:55:17,653
I'll introduce you, you
introduce your team.

675
00:55:17,688 --> 00:55:20,295
- He knows this is a high-level meeting.
- Quick question.

676
00:55:21,541 --> 00:55:23,663
All this taking place
inside our main building?

677
00:55:23,698 --> 00:55:26,877
Right, and, uh, Lauren,
Washington will want...

678
00:55:26,919 --> 00:55:29,640
real-time updates, so please,
stay on top of that.

679
00:55:30,121 --> 00:55:31,924
Be concise, the
director's in the loop.

680
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:34,790
And I wouldn't be surprised,

681
00:55:36,586 --> 00:55:38,275
if he doesn't update
the president.

682
00:55:39,178 --> 00:55:40,150
Yeah, I'm on it.

683
00:55:40,974 --> 00:55:43,352
Now, I just gotta get
his ass down here.

684
00:57:29,052 --> 00:57:30,697
Why are there gate guards there?

685
00:57:30,732 --> 00:57:33,276
We talked about this, no one is supposed
to be there when my source arrives.

686
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:35,058
You might have
spooked him already.

687
00:57:35,093 --> 00:57:37,644
Well, procedures only work if
we follow them every time.

688
00:57:37,676 --> 00:57:41,698
This is different. I'm sorry, I can't
explain, but it's for a good cause.

689
00:57:42,608 --> 00:57:44,431
Look, I'm responsible for
everybody's safety, okay.

690
00:57:44,444 --> 00:57:46,277
It's not just about you.

691
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:47,930
I just need them to
go away for a minute.

692
00:57:47,941 --> 00:57:49,621
You can search him as
soon as he gets here.

693
00:57:54,177 --> 00:57:57,092
All stations, this is Whiplash.

694
00:57:57,259 --> 00:57:58,619
<i>Go ahead and stand down.</i>

695
00:57:59,477 --> 00:58:00,411
Copy that.

696
00:58:23,177 --> 00:58:24,255
Thank you.

697
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:09,425
Okay, he's coming.

698
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:14,804
- We gonna search him when he gets here.
- Sure.

699
00:59:52,411 --> 00:59:53,660
Okay, let's go.

700
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:14,323
- Is he supposed to limp like that?
- Get your hand out of your pocket.

701
01:00:15,474 --> 01:00:17,663
- Hey.
- "Allah hu Akbar. " (God is Great)

702
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:19,410
- Hey!
- Get your hand out of your pocket.

703
01:00:19,445 --> 01:00:21,385
- Do it now!
- "Allah hu Akbar."

704
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,581
- Get your hand out of your poc...
- "Allah hu Akb..."

705
01:00:42,577 --> 01:00:45,145
<i>The CIA says, seven of it's
employees were killed,</i>

706
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:49,331
<i>and six others wounded, in a suicide
bombing in a base in Afghanistan.</i>

707
01:00:49,366 --> 01:00:52,346
<i>It was one of the deadliest
attacks in CIA history.</i>

708
01:00:52,379 --> 01:00:53,784
<i>The Associated Press
has learned that...</i>

709
01:00:53,819 --> 01:00:57,273
<i>the chief of the CIA's post in the
province, is among the victims.</i>

710
01:00:57,308 --> 01:01:00,075
<i>Former officials say, she
was the mother of three.</i>

711
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:02,656
<i>The Taliban claimed resposibility
for the bombing...</i>

712
01:01:53,271 --> 01:01:55,248
- You okay?
- Mhm.

713
01:01:56,479 --> 01:02:00,410
I, um, didn't think this
day could get any worse,

714
01:02:01,735 --> 01:02:02,979
But, uh...

715
01:02:03,755 --> 01:02:07,166
bad news from Saudi intelligence.
The, um...

716
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:10,824
courier guy, Abu Ahmed, is dead.

717
01:02:11,912 --> 01:02:13,680
It's a detainee video.

718
01:02:37,413 --> 01:02:38,136
<i>He's dead.</i>

719
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,659
<i>In Afghanistan, 2001, I
buried him with my own hands.</i>

720
01:02:45,713 --> 01:02:49,180
<i>He's dead. In
Afghanistan, 2001...</i>

721
01:02:50,013 --> 01:02:51,141
<i>And where was this?</i>

722
01:02:52,478 --> 01:02:53,304
<i>Kabul.</i>

723
01:02:53,457 --> 01:02:56,190
No, I don't believe this.
I don't believe this.

724
01:02:57,748 --> 01:02:58,796
Sorry, Maya.

725
01:03:00,112 --> 01:03:01,679
I always liked this lead.

726
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:28,345
Sorry I just got here.

727
01:03:39,179 --> 01:03:40,184
What are you going to do?

728
01:03:47,891 --> 01:03:50,865
I'm gonna smoke everybody
involved in this op.

729
01:03:52,586 --> 01:03:54,441
And then I'm gonna
kill bin Laden.

730
01:04:04,429 --> 01:04:05,363
Right.

731
01:04:07,805 --> 01:04:08,531
Right.

732
01:04:31,855 --> 01:04:33,907
I wanna make something
absolutely clear.

733
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:36,986
If you thought there was some...

734
01:04:38,088 --> 01:04:41,289
secret cell somewhere,
working al-Qaeda,

735
01:04:42,269 --> 01:04:44,012
well, I want you to
know that you're wrong.

736
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,111
This is it.

737
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:51,593
There's no working group
coming to the rescue.

738
01:04:53,287 --> 01:04:56,275
There's nobody else hidden
away on some other floor.

739
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:58,618
There is just us.

740
01:05:00,657 --> 01:05:02,285
And we are failing!

741
01:05:05,756 --> 01:05:07,849
We're spending
billions of dollars.

742
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:09,884
People are dying!

743
01:05:11,299 --> 01:05:14,555
We are still no closer
to defeating our enemy.

744
01:05:16,937 --> 01:05:18,466
They attacked us!

745
01:05:19,258 --> 01:05:21,677
On land, in '98,

746
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:26,257
by sea in 2000, and
from the air in 2001.

747
01:05:28,171 --> 01:05:33,202
They murdered 3,000 of our
citizens, in cold blood.

748
01:05:34,748 --> 01:05:37,243
And they have slaughtered
our forward-deployed!

749
01:05:37,675 --> 01:05:40,309
And what the fuck have
we done about it, huh?

750
01:05:43,181 --> 01:05:44,314
What have we done?

751
01:05:46,793 --> 01:05:51,262
We have twenty leadership names.
We've only eliminated four of them.

752
01:05:54,266 --> 01:05:55,272
I want...

753
01:05:56,097 --> 01:05:56,948
targets.

754
01:05:58,194 --> 01:06:01,481
Do your fuckin' jobs,
bring me people to kill.

755
01:06:27,539 --> 01:06:31,149
Hi, I painstakingly combed through
everything in the system and found this.

756
01:06:33,403 --> 01:06:34,158
It's him.

757
01:06:35,016 --> 01:06:39,089
He was one of ten names on a watch list
sent to us by the Moroccans after 9/11.

758
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:40,909
Ibrahim Sayeed.

759
01:06:41,046 --> 01:06:43,121
They told us to watch out for him.
Apparently,

760
01:06:43,156 --> 01:06:47,397
they think his whole family and extended
family is bad, and has ties to KSM.

761
01:06:47,991 --> 01:06:51,737
He was picked up for fake papers and a
doctored exit visa leaving Afghanistan,

762
01:06:51,772 --> 01:06:54,089
traveling through Morocco,
en route to Kuwait.

763
01:06:54,102 --> 01:06:56,429
Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti.

764
01:06:56,864 --> 01:06:58,955
This must be Abu Ahmed.

765
01:07:05,042 --> 01:07:07,919
Doesn't matter. God, I wish
I had that five years ago.

766
01:07:09,336 --> 01:07:12,474
- How come I never saw it before?
- Nobody saw it, most likely.

767
01:07:13,191 --> 01:07:15,261
There was a lot of white
noise after 9/11.

768
01:07:15,427 --> 01:07:18,755
Countries wanting to help out.
We got a million tips, and...

769
01:07:19,588 --> 01:07:22,000
you know, things got
lost in the shuffle.

770
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:24,544
Human error.

771
01:07:26,512 --> 01:07:28,562
Anyway, I thought you
should know about it.

772
01:07:35,907 --> 01:07:38,690
I just wanna say, I've
heard a lot about you.

773
01:07:39,492 --> 01:07:41,337
You've inspired me
to come to Pakistan.

774
01:07:42,182 --> 01:07:44,617
Maybe you'd let me buy
you a kebab sometime.

775
01:07:44,957 --> 01:07:46,067
Don't eat out.

776
01:07:47,843 --> 01:07:49,108
It's too dangerous.

777
01:08:06,766 --> 01:08:10,018
- Yup.
- Dan, Debbie found Abu Ahmed.

778
01:08:11,598 --> 01:08:12,667
Really?

779
01:08:12,904 --> 01:08:14,248
<i>Yeah, he's been in
the files this...</i>

780
01:08:14,283 --> 01:08:16,537
whole time. The family's
name is Sayeed.

781
01:08:17,045 --> 01:08:18,193
Okay, but he's, uh...

782
01:08:18,228 --> 01:08:21,200
he's dead, so doesn't that make him
a little less interesting to you?

783
01:08:21,235 --> 01:08:24,992
<i>He may not be. We now know Abu
Ahmed is one of eight brothers.</i>

784
01:08:25,103 --> 01:08:28,500
All the brothers in the family look alike.
Three of them went to Afghanistan.

785
01:08:28,535 --> 01:08:29,846
<i>Isn't it possible that when...</i>

786
01:08:29,881 --> 01:08:34,129
<i>the three eldest brothers grew beards in
Afghanistan, they started to look alike?</i>

787
01:08:34,164 --> 01:08:36,994
I think the one calling himself
Abu Ahmed is still alive.

788
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:39,726
The picture we've
been using is wrong.

789
01:08:39,761 --> 01:08:44,242
It's of his older brother, Habib.
He's the one that's dead.

790
01:08:44,477 --> 01:08:46,065
Okay, and what are
you basing this on?

791
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:48,873
<i>We have no intercepts
about Abu Ahmed dying.</i>

792
01:08:49,052 --> 01:08:52,683
We just have a detainee, who said he
buried a guy, who looked like Abu Ahmed.

793
01:08:52,718 --> 01:08:55,265
But if someone as important
as Abu Ahmed had died,

794
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:56,757
they'd be talking
about it online,

795
01:08:56,792 --> 01:08:58,444
<i>in chatrooms all
over the place.</i>

796
01:08:58,576 --> 01:09:01,964
<i>Plus, the detainee said
that Habib died in 2001.</i>

797
01:09:01,999 --> 01:09:05,896
We know Abu Ahmed was alive then, trying
to get into Tora Bora with Ammar.

798
01:09:05,931 --> 01:09:08,841
That means it's probably one
of the other brothers...

799
01:09:08,886 --> 01:09:10,116
<i>that's dead.</i>

800
01:09:13,309 --> 01:09:16,737
- In other words, you want it to be true.
- Yes, I fucking want it to be true!

801
01:09:16,772 --> 01:09:18,710
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, calm down.</i>

802
01:09:18,745 --> 01:09:21,024
- Calm down.
- I am calm.

803
01:09:22,676 --> 01:09:23,849
State your request.

804
01:09:25,854 --> 01:09:27,088
Move heaven and earth.

805
01:09:28,321 --> 01:09:31,754
And bring me this fucking
Sayeed family's phone number.

806
01:09:35,969 --> 01:09:37,747
<i>Okay, I'll go and
talk to the Wolf.</i>

807
01:09:58,983 --> 01:10:02,144
- As-salam alaykum. (Peace be unto you)
- Wa-alaykum salam. (And unto you peace)

808
01:10:08,765 --> 01:10:10,793
I need a couple of
hundred thousand bucks.

809
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:13,446
Four max.

810
01:10:16,475 --> 01:10:19,486
- Where're you gonna get that?
- From you.

811
01:10:19,769 --> 01:10:21,344
- You think so?
- Yeah.

812
01:10:21,536 --> 01:10:22,459
This could crack open...

813
01:10:22,494 --> 01:10:25,393
the facilitator Maya's been looking
for, by giving us a phone number.

814
01:10:27,182 --> 01:10:29,142
She's your killer, Wolf,
you put her on the field.

815
01:10:30,906 --> 01:10:31,607
Come on.

816
01:10:31,642 --> 01:10:34,044
"Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Raheem" (In the
name of God, most Gracious, most Merciful)

817
01:10:34,335 --> 01:10:38,798
Allah rewards those that strive and
fight, over those that sit behind a desk.

818
01:10:42,769 --> 01:10:46,930
As you know, Abu Ghraib
and Gitmo fucked us.

819
01:10:47,852 --> 01:10:52,176
The Detainee Program is now flypaper. We
got Senators jumping out of our asses.

820
01:10:52,824 --> 01:10:55,019
And the director
is very concerned.

821
01:10:56,313 --> 01:10:58,953
They will not stop until
they have a body.

822
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:02,491
I ran it.

823
01:11:04,681 --> 01:11:05,726
I'll defend it.

824
01:11:10,147 --> 01:11:10,944
Done.

825
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:35,083
I tell you what, man, it's
good to be back in Kuwait.

826
01:11:35,929 --> 01:11:39,253
It's good to see you again.
Huh? It's been a while.

827
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:46,191
I need a favor.

828
01:11:48,955 --> 01:11:50,273
Why I should help you?

829
01:11:50,994 --> 01:11:52,143
Because we're friends.

830
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,985
You say we are friend.

831
01:11:54,650 --> 01:11:57,129
How come you only call
me when you need help?

832
01:11:57,631 --> 01:12:00,820
But when I need something, you are
too busy to pick up the phone.

833
01:12:01,434 --> 01:12:04,649
- I don't think we are friends.
- All right, fair enough.

834
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:09,922
How about a V10 Lamborghini?
How's that for friendship?

835
01:12:11,855 --> 01:12:13,290
Poor fucker had to
get out of bed.

836
01:12:17,325 --> 01:12:18,049
Hey.

837
01:12:21,851 --> 01:12:23,371
- As-salam alaykum.
- Wa-alaykum salam.

838
01:12:23,383 --> 01:12:24,503
- Thank you very much for this.
- You're welcome.

839
01:12:24,538 --> 01:12:25,357
Appreciate it.

840
01:12:28,299 --> 01:12:29,240
All right.

841
01:12:30,833 --> 01:12:32,694
- Ooh, is this a Balboni?
- Yeah.

842
01:12:35,265 --> 01:12:36,258
Fuck me dead.

843
01:12:37,247 --> 01:12:40,106
It's nice, really nice.
What are you thinking?

844
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,291
Huh? Maybe a convertible? Get a
little bit of wind in the hair?

845
01:12:45,406 --> 01:12:46,839
Huh? Put the top down?

846
01:12:50,405 --> 01:12:52,138
I think I will choose this one.

847
01:12:52,762 --> 01:12:54,504
Give us a minute? Thank you.

848
01:12:55,689 --> 01:12:59,363
That's a nice choice, my friend. Speed
yellow, go big or go home, huh?

849
01:12:59,999 --> 01:13:01,215
Nice choice.

850
01:13:08,416 --> 01:13:09,261
Sayeed.

851
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,301
- Who is it?
- Who do you think?

852
01:13:14,185 --> 01:13:15,254
Guy's a terrorist.

853
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:17,036
His mother lives here.

854
01:13:18,444 --> 01:13:20,153
I just need her phone number.

855
01:13:21,952 --> 01:13:24,369
There will be no
repercussions in Kuwait

856
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,886
I mean, somebody might die,
at some point, in Pakistan.

857
01:13:32,164 --> 01:13:33,257
We got a deal?

858
01:14:19,161 --> 01:14:19,918
Hey, Jack.

859
01:14:20,282 --> 01:14:22,857
Sayeed family call in progress,
but you're not gonna like this.

860
01:14:23,092 --> 01:14:25,080
<i>The ground branch guys are
dragging their heels,</i>

861
01:14:25,115 --> 01:14:26,885
<i>there's no team
deployed right now.</i>

862
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:27,623
Fuck.

863
01:14:27,658 --> 01:14:29,074
<i>He hasn't said anything
incriminating,</i>

864
01:14:29,109 --> 01:14:31,380
<i>but he's at the Rawal call
center in Rawalpindi.</i>

865
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:34,310
Hey!

866
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:37,971
Why haven't you deployed a
team to stay in Rawalpindi?

867
01:14:40,838 --> 01:14:42,225
For one thing, it's dangerous.

868
01:14:43,786 --> 01:14:46,512
For another, the area is too
congested for us to be effective,

869
01:14:46,547 --> 01:14:49,107
- without some predictive intelligence.
- Yeah, but that's why...

870
01:14:49,115 --> 01:14:51,583
you should forward deploy, so you
can shorten the response time.

871
01:14:51,618 --> 01:14:53,387
- It still wouldn't work.
- Why?

872
01:14:56,534 --> 01:14:58,377
The guy never stays on
the phone long enough.

873
01:14:58,412 --> 01:15:01,560
- You haven't tried.
- Look, I don't have the personnel.

874
01:15:01,595 --> 01:15:03,330
- That's bullshit, man.
- Yeah?

875
01:15:03,642 --> 01:15:07,053
As it is, my guys don't get any sleep,
tracking the threats within Pakistan.

876
01:15:07,847 --> 01:15:08,848
Right, I understand.

877
01:15:08,883 --> 01:15:11,661
But, you know, I don't really care
if your guys get sleep or not.

878
01:15:33,707 --> 01:15:35,345
This guy you are obsessed with.

879
01:15:36,650 --> 01:15:37,530
What's his name again?

880
01:15:37,835 --> 01:15:40,280
Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti
is the nom de guerre.

881
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,421
His true name, we think,
is Ibrahim Sayeed.

882
01:15:44,581 --> 01:15:47,208
Family lives in Kuwait. We've
been listening in on their calls.

883
01:15:48,066 --> 01:15:48,770
Wasn't it,

884
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:54,194
like, eight brothers and a million
cousins that we know about?

885
01:15:55,314 --> 01:15:57,535
- Anyone could be calling home.
- I know.

886
01:15:57,570 --> 01:16:00,370
I mean, it's not like he's saying,
"Hey, Mom, it's me, the terrorist."

887
01:16:01,527 --> 01:16:05,712
Yeah, I know. But, look, over
the course of two months,

888
01:16:06,076 --> 01:16:07,812
He's called from six
different payphones

889
01:16:07,847 --> 01:16:11,087
from two different cities, never
using the same phone twice.

890
01:16:11,142 --> 01:16:13,654
And when his mother asked
him where he was, he lied.

891
01:16:13,964 --> 01:16:16,775
He said that he was in a place in the
country with bad cell reception,

892
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:20,796
implying he was in the Tribals. When, in
fact, he was in a market in Peshawar.

893
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:23,932
I'm sorry but that's not normal
guy behavior, that's tradecraft.

894
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:28,921
Or maybe he just
doesn't like his Mum.

895
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:36,177
Look, if he talks
about an operation or

896
01:16:36,961 --> 01:16:40,385
refers to anything remotely
fishy, I'll get on him, okay?

897
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:42,006
No, no, not okay, look.

898
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:47,277
Abu Ahmed is too smart to tip his hand,
by talking about ops on the phone.

899
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:49,549
He works for bin Laden.

900
01:16:49,941 --> 01:16:52,747
The guys that talk about ops on
the phone don't get that job.

901
01:16:57,521 --> 01:17:00,075
A lot of my friends have
died, trying to do this.

902
01:17:04,426 --> 01:17:07,147
I believe I was spared, so
I could finish the job.

903
01:18:10,568 --> 01:18:15,222
<i>It is in surveillance video and pictures
like this of the explosive-laden vehicle</i>

904
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:19,035
<i>just moments before it was parked,
that police hope to find the man,</i>

905
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:23,704
<i>who wanted so badly last night, to
leave a body count in Times Square.</i>

906
01:18:23,739 --> 01:18:27,505
<i>There are some people around the world,
that find our freedom so threatening,</i>

907
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:30,067
<i>that they're willing to
kill themselves and others,</i>

908
01:18:30,102 --> 01:18:32,664
<i>to prevent us from enjoying it, but
we're not gonna let that happen...</i>

909
01:18:32,699 --> 01:18:33,910
Hey, I really need
to talk to you...

910
01:18:33,945 --> 01:18:36,103
about beefing up our surveillance
operation on the caller.

911
01:18:36,148 --> 01:18:38,940
We don't have a surveillance
operation on the caller.

912
01:18:39,443 --> 01:18:42,366
Someone just tried to blow up Times
Square and you're talking to me about...

913
01:18:42,401 --> 01:18:45,059
some facilitator, who some
detainee, seven years ago, said,

914
01:18:45,094 --> 01:18:48,177
- might have been working with al-Qaeda?
- He's the key to bin Laden.

915
01:18:50,799 --> 01:18:54,744
I don't fucking care about bin
Laden, I care about the next attack.

916
01:18:55,275 --> 01:18:58,120
You're gonna start working on
the American al-Qaeda cells.

917
01:18:58,155 --> 01:18:59,156
Protect the homeland.

918
01:18:59,266 --> 01:19:02,461
Bin Laden is the one who keeps
telling them to attack the homeland.

919
01:19:03,362 --> 01:19:06,985
If it wasn't for him, al-Qaeda would
still be focused on overseas targets.

920
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:10,866
If you really wanna protect the
homeland, you need to get bin Laden.

921
01:19:10,901 --> 01:19:12,815
This guy never met bin Laden.

922
01:19:14,013 --> 01:19:16,727
This guy's a freelancer working
off the fucking internet.

923
01:19:17,091 --> 01:19:18,779
No one's even talked to
bin Laden in four years.

924
01:19:18,792 --> 01:19:20,491
He's out of the game.

925
01:19:20,526 --> 01:19:23,128
He may well even be dead. He
might as well be fucking dead.

926
01:19:23,163 --> 01:19:24,585
But you know what you're doing?

927
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:28,064
You're chasing a ghost while the whole
fucking network grows all around you.

928
01:19:28,099 --> 01:19:30,811
You just want me to nail some
low-level molar-cracker-doler,

929
01:19:30,846 --> 01:19:32,846
so you can check that box
on your resume that says,

930
01:19:32,862 --> 01:19:35,922
while you were in Pakistan,
you got a real terrorist.

931
01:19:35,957 --> 01:19:41,305
But the truth is, you don't understand
Pakistan, and you don't know al-Qaeda!

932
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:44,440
Either give me the team I
need, to follow this lead,

933
01:19:44,475 --> 01:19:46,237
or that other thing you're
gonna have on your resume,

934
01:19:46,272 --> 01:19:49,721
is being the first station chief to be
called before Congressional Committee,

935
01:19:49,756 --> 01:19:54,096
for subverting the efforts to
capture or kill bin Laden!

936
01:19:58,347 --> 01:20:00,226
You're fucking out of your mind.

937
01:20:02,323 --> 01:20:05,085
I need four techs and a
safe house in Rawalpindi.

938
01:20:06,133 --> 01:20:07,951
Four techs and a safe
house in Peshawar.

939
01:20:08,893 --> 01:20:09,733
Either send them out,

940
01:20:09,752 --> 01:20:13,306
or send me back to DC, and explain
to the director why you didn't.

941
01:20:33,235 --> 01:20:34,297
I've been looking for you.

942
01:20:34,806 --> 01:20:35,773
But more importantly,

943
01:20:36,464 --> 01:20:37,580
he's been looking for you.

944
01:20:38,782 --> 01:20:41,002
Yesterday, your caller
bought himself a cell phone.

945
01:20:42,303 --> 01:20:44,218
And every time his phone rings,

946
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,441
this phone will ring.

947
01:20:48,962 --> 01:20:50,724
Did I hook you up? Did I?

948
01:21:02,990 --> 01:21:06,046
My guess is that he lives close
to where he's making the calls.

949
01:21:06,172 --> 01:21:08,736
And it makes sense he'd
be living in Rawalpindi,

950
01:21:09,116 --> 01:21:11,205
because there's an Al
Jazeera office there.

951
01:21:12,089 --> 01:21:14,104
It'd be convenient for him
to drop the tapes off,

952
01:21:14,139 --> 01:21:18,100
if he's messengering, either from
Bin Laden, or to an intermediary.

953
01:21:18,339 --> 01:21:20,407
So, when he wants
to make a call,

954
01:21:20,731 --> 01:21:24,502
he leaves the house, walks a few
blocks, then switches on the phone.

955
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,360
We need to keep canvassing the
neighborhood until we find him.

956
01:21:43,015 --> 01:21:44,012
We got a shooter.

957
01:21:50,549 --> 01:21:51,475
We're blocked.

958
01:21:57,535 --> 01:21:58,573
Let me talk to them.

959
01:22:35,187 --> 01:22:37,058
They said whites faces
don't belong here.

960
01:22:38,655 --> 01:22:40,398
If they don't move, shoot them.

961
01:23:11,004 --> 01:23:11,938
He's still on?

962
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:16,249
- He's east of us, try the market.
- Okay, heading east.

963
01:23:27,499 --> 01:23:28,258
Fuck.

964
01:24:04,134 --> 01:24:07,661
We got a signal on Tipu
Road for ten minutes.

965
01:24:08,513 --> 01:24:11,093
Then he went to Umar
Road for 5 minutes,

966
01:24:11,128 --> 01:24:15,744
NoGaza Road, Darya Abad,
that's in the Umar Road area.

967
01:24:16,058 --> 01:24:17,250
In Rawalpindi,

968
01:24:17,926 --> 01:24:18,986
Haider Road.

969
01:24:19,407 --> 01:24:20,776
Roomi Road.

970
01:24:21,776 --> 01:24:24,571
He went to the Convoy Road, which
is near the hospital, all right?

971
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:31,055
So that's Haider, Roomi Road,
Zahid, NoGaza, Taimur.

972
01:24:31,516 --> 01:24:35,068
He made a call from Hapur Street.
That's the Spice District.

973
01:24:35,639 --> 01:24:38,608
Lahore Street, which is also in Pesh.
30 minutes.

974
01:24:39,518 --> 01:24:42,007
Wazir Bagh Road - 5.

975
01:24:42,758 --> 01:24:45,110
Nishtarabad - 5.

976
01:24:47,433 --> 01:24:49,652
Phandu Road - 5 minutes.

977
01:24:53,943 --> 01:24:56,524
The Grand Trunk Road.
45 seconds.

978
01:24:57,610 --> 01:24:58,853
There's no pattern.

979
01:24:59,701 --> 01:25:01,825
Sometimes, he calls every two
weeks, sometimes, every three.

980
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:02,986
There's no consistency.

981
01:25:03,107 --> 01:25:06,107
I can't predict when he's gonna make
another call, 'cause the guy's erratic.

982
01:26:08,875 --> 01:26:12,317
<i>Meanwhile, our chief foreign
correspondent, Richard Engel confirms...</i>

983
01:26:12,352 --> 01:26:16,766
<i>the CIA's top spy in Pakistan
has been pulled out of there.</i>

984
01:26:16,801 --> 01:26:20,512
<i>He's been receiving death threats, after
being named publicly in a lawsuit,</i>

985
01:26:20,547 --> 01:26:24,368
<i>by the family of a victim
of a US drone attack.</i>

986
01:26:24,403 --> 01:26:27,511
<i>Richard Engel quotes a senior
intelligence official as saying,</i>

987
01:26:27,546 --> 01:26:31,513
<i>the officer is returning to the US,
after the decision was made that...</i>

988
01:26:31,548 --> 01:26:36,030
<i>terrorist threats against him, in
Pakistan, were of such a serious nature,</i>

989
01:26:36,065 --> 01:26:38,594
<i>it would not be
smart not to act.</i>

990
01:26:41,394 --> 01:26:42,995
ISI fucked you.

991
01:26:47,194 --> 01:26:48,895
I'm so sorry, Joseph.

992
01:27:19,381 --> 01:27:20,427
Still on tower three.

993
01:27:21,295 --> 01:27:22,044
5...

994
01:27:22,964 --> 01:27:24,834
Signal getting stronger, 10...

995
01:27:25,557 --> 01:27:26,787
15... Keep going.

996
01:27:27,183 --> 01:27:29,813
20... 15... 10...

997
01:27:30,418 --> 01:27:31,762
Signal's getting weaker.

998
01:27:36,548 --> 01:27:38,698
We lost him, no signal.

999
01:27:41,284 --> 01:27:42,548
Heading south.

1000
01:27:51,007 --> 01:27:52,113
He's up at 5 again.

1001
01:27:52,779 --> 01:27:54,115
15... 20...

1002
01:27:55,045 --> 01:27:57,154
He's moving fast,
he's in a vehicle.

1003
01:27:57,801 --> 01:27:59,281
Weaker now, he shifted.
Go back to 5.

1004
01:28:02,083 --> 01:28:03,585
He's close by here, somewhere.

1005
01:28:04,510 --> 01:28:05,550
I don't get it.

1006
01:28:07,975 --> 01:28:09,604
He's driving in circles.

1007
01:28:20,405 --> 01:28:21,619
- No change?
- No.

1008
01:28:31,381 --> 01:28:33,513
Now let's hope he
comes back around.

1009
01:29:05,582 --> 01:29:07,027
Okay, 15...

1010
01:29:08,682 --> 01:29:09,430
20...

1011
01:29:10,087 --> 01:29:10,809
30...

1012
01:29:12,103 --> 01:29:12,860
40...

1013
01:29:13,737 --> 01:29:14,510
50...

1014
01:29:15,505 --> 01:29:16,729
We're within ten meters of it.

1015
01:29:24,866 --> 01:29:25,720
Back to 40.

1016
01:29:27,343 --> 01:29:29,008
- He's here somewhere.
- Look at the cars.

1017
01:29:29,432 --> 01:29:30,872
Look at the cars,
he's in a vehicle.

1018
01:29:37,524 --> 01:29:39,125
The guy with the phone
in the white car.

1019
01:29:40,259 --> 01:29:41,110
You see him?

1020
01:29:42,988 --> 01:29:44,620
- Is that him?
- Could be.

1021
01:29:45,319 --> 01:29:46,540
- You got him?
- Got him.

1022
01:29:46,696 --> 01:29:47,645
Okay, breaking off.

1023
01:29:51,124 --> 01:29:52,642
The guy you've been looking for,

1024
01:29:52,912 --> 01:29:54,083
geolocated,

1025
01:29:54,355 --> 01:29:55,395
on his cell phone,

1026
01:29:55,969 --> 01:29:56,791
in his white car.

1027
01:29:58,668 --> 01:29:59,561
Thank you.

1028
01:30:02,432 --> 01:30:03,225
If you're right,

1029
01:30:04,457 --> 01:30:06,442
the whole world's gonna
want in on this.

1030
01:30:07,451 --> 01:30:09,159
So, you gotta stick
to your guns now.

1031
01:30:17,822 --> 01:30:21,760
Okay. No, it's great to speak to you too
I'm-I'm amazed that you're still here.

1032
01:30:23,464 --> 01:30:24,947
Well, I-I can do, um...

1033
01:30:25,562 --> 01:30:26,872
Let me have a look, um...

1034
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,659
Why don't we say 1:30.

1035
01:30:31,857 --> 01:30:32,557
Yeah.

1036
01:30:33,451 --> 01:30:35,663
Uh, can you just hold
the line, please?

1037
01:30:36,602 --> 01:30:39,441
I need a picket line along the GT
Highway, and men spaced at intervals...

1038
01:30:39,476 --> 01:30:42,260
- along the road, and at every exit.
- Maya, I know.

1039
01:30:42,463 --> 01:30:44,797
So, you agree with me
now, this is important.

1040
01:30:46,435 --> 01:30:49,508
No, I've just learned from my
predecessor, that life is better...

1041
01:30:49,543 --> 01:30:51,156
when I don't disagree with you.

1042
01:31:35,783 --> 01:31:38,693
Our current hypothesis is that he
lives somewhere along the highway,

1043
01:31:39,230 --> 01:31:42,001
in one of the towns, or a
medium-sized city called Abbottabad,

1044
01:31:42,036 --> 01:31:43,464
or up near Kashmir.

1045
01:31:45,471 --> 01:31:48,659
Kashmir is interesting because it's
a way station for the Tribals.

1046
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:53,131
Abbottabad is interesting because we
know from detainee reporting that...

1047
01:31:53,166 --> 01:31:55,964
Abu Faraj stayed there,
briefly, in 2003.

1048
01:31:58,743 --> 01:32:01,095
The good news is he's
driving a white SUV.

1049
01:32:01,571 --> 01:32:03,865
SUVs are actually pretty
rare in Pakistan.

1050
01:32:04,881 --> 01:32:07,472
If he was driving a sedan or
a compact, we'd be fucked.

1051
01:32:08,571 --> 01:32:10,966
Obviously, this assumes he
doesn't change vehicles.

1052
01:32:24,576 --> 01:32:26,451
- Morning.
- Morning, Hamad.

1053
01:33:23,339 --> 01:33:24,091
"Yalla, yalla..."

1054
01:33:31,609 --> 01:33:36,442
Any American in Pakistan is a target.
They don't necessarily know I'm CIA.

1055
01:33:36,761 --> 01:33:37,607
Doesn't matter.

1056
01:33:38,487 --> 01:33:39,542
You're on a list.

1057
01:33:40,401 --> 01:33:41,101
Yeah.

1058
01:33:41,573 --> 01:33:44,620
And you, of all people, should know
that once you're on their list,

1059
01:33:46,124 --> 01:33:47,340
you never get off.

1060
01:33:48,691 --> 01:33:51,490
Next time, there may not be
bulletproof glass to save you.

1061
01:33:54,217 --> 01:33:56,378
We'll keep up on the
surveillance as best we can.

1062
01:35:33,055 --> 01:35:35,276
The high-res version, can
you get closer than that?

1063
01:35:35,311 --> 01:35:36,831
Yeah, well, you can
up-res this image.

1064
01:35:37,458 --> 01:35:38,221
Even more?

1065
01:35:39,944 --> 01:35:41,177
Okay, that's good. Thank you.

1066
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:46,399
I'll take that. Thank
you very much.

1067
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:48,379
- Take that too.
- You got it "ch".

1068
01:35:48,699 --> 01:35:51,166
To clean that audio as well,
just take the low one out.

1069
01:36:06,215 --> 01:36:06,937
Hey.

1070
01:36:08,866 --> 01:36:11,466
All right, so tell me
how I'm doing so far.

1071
01:36:11,552 --> 01:36:14,512
Basically, we had a guy who rolled with
al-Qaeda, and did services for him.

1072
01:36:14,528 --> 01:36:16,203
- Mm-hm.
- We lost him for seven years.

1073
01:36:16,238 --> 01:36:19,784
Now we find him again, and... boy,
does he have a really nice house.

1074
01:36:19,819 --> 01:36:21,988
- Is that it?
- Pretty much.

1075
01:36:22,839 --> 01:36:25,090
All right, let's go
talk to the boss.

1076
01:36:29,961 --> 01:36:32,189
Oh, you, uh, you
should sit back there.

1077
01:36:33,162 --> 01:36:34,065
- Sorry.
- No.

1078
01:36:40,073 --> 01:36:41,088
So they're gonna ask,

1079
01:36:42,050 --> 01:36:44,070
if bin Laden is at the
end of this rainbow.

1080
01:36:45,293 --> 01:36:46,843
Is the Pak military with him?

1081
01:36:47,483 --> 01:36:49,875
The question isn't: Are the
Paks protecting bin Laden?

1082
01:36:50,122 --> 01:36:52,854
The question is: Would he allow
himself to be protected by the Paks?

1083
01:36:53,324 --> 01:36:55,832
I mean, why would he trust them?
He tried to kill Musharraf.

1084
01:37:05,087 --> 01:37:06,288
- Hello.
- Sir.

1085
01:37:08,342 --> 01:37:09,339
All right, go ahead.

1086
01:37:10,138 --> 01:37:13,385
So a little context here, if you
take a right, out of Islamabad,

1087
01:37:13,427 --> 01:37:17,153
drive about forty-five minutes north,
you'll find yourself here in Abbottabad.

1088
01:37:17,453 --> 01:37:20,784
Now it's a mostly middle-class
community, some ex-military.

1089
01:37:20,819 --> 01:37:22,629
Not particularly
interesting to us.

1090
01:37:22,972 --> 01:37:25,880
Except we did find this
compound, which is unique.

1091
01:37:26,906 --> 01:37:29,865
We got a 16-foot wall around
the entire perimeter.

1092
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:31,377
The windows are blacked out.

1093
01:37:31,585 --> 01:37:34,119
There's even a 7-foot
privacy wall here, so,

1094
01:37:34,450 --> 01:37:36,900
even if we got up high, we
couldn't get a vantage point.

1095
01:37:36,935 --> 01:37:37,693
I mean it's-

1096
01:37:38,030 --> 01:37:39,344
it's a fortress.

1097
01:37:39,984 --> 01:37:41,701
Well, can't you put
a camera somewhere?

1098
01:37:42,567 --> 01:37:45,237
In these trees here, maybe?
Get a look in the main house?

1099
01:37:45,546 --> 01:37:46,985
It would probably be discovered.

1100
01:37:49,906 --> 01:37:52,124
Well, we have to get a look
into the house, don't we?

1101
01:37:57,736 --> 01:37:58,552
All right.

1102
01:37:59,515 --> 01:38:01,836
What's this? This cluster
of buildings down here?

1103
01:38:01,894 --> 01:38:04,618
The PMA. It's the Pakistani
Military Academy.

1104
01:38:07,374 --> 01:38:08,793
It's their West Point.

1105
01:38:15,124 --> 01:38:16,690
And how close is
that to the house?

1106
01:38:17,932 --> 01:38:18,815
About a mile.

1107
01:38:19,288 --> 01:38:22,394
4,221 feet. It's closer to
eight-tenths of a mile.

1108
01:38:23,678 --> 01:38:24,659
But who are you?

1109
01:38:24,937 --> 01:38:27,379
I'm the motherfucker that
found this place, sir.

1110
01:38:29,807 --> 01:38:30,736
Really?

1111
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:39,021
All right, I wanna know more about who's
inside this house by the end of the week.

1112
01:38:41,355 --> 01:38:42,318
Sir.

1113
01:38:51,791 --> 01:38:52,891
Motherfucker.

1114
01:38:55,307 --> 01:38:56,016
Good.

1115
01:39:14,235 --> 01:39:15,308
Morning, George.

1116
01:39:17,350 --> 01:39:18,559
21 days.

1117
01:39:19,433 --> 01:39:22,268
It's been 21 days since we found
the house, nothing's happened.

1118
01:39:58,279 --> 01:39:58,979
Yeah.

1119
01:39:59,014 --> 01:40:00,043
<i>Maya, it's Steve.</i>

1120
01:40:00,569 --> 01:40:03,441
- Swing by, I wanna show you something.
- Okay.

1121
01:40:04,539 --> 01:40:06,760
Okay, you can leave it paused for now,
but we're gonna play through that...

1122
01:40:06,795 --> 01:40:07,495
Hey!

1123
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:10,010
- Maya, come see.
- Yeah.

1124
01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:13,985
Okay, this is from a
few minutes ago, okay?

1125
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:14,740
Yeah.

1126
01:40:14,805 --> 01:40:18,129
So remember, we've got two males,
two females and seven kids.

1127
01:40:18,164 --> 01:40:18,864
What's that?

1128
01:40:18,899 --> 01:40:21,045
Okay, I'm saying that's
Bushra, the brother's wife.

1129
01:40:21,276 --> 01:40:22,837
Whoa, whoa, how do
you know the gender?

1130
01:40:23,201 --> 01:40:25,135
Well, look, this is a clothesline
right here for laundry.

1131
01:40:25,170 --> 01:40:26,368
Men don't mess with the wash.

1132
01:40:26,735 --> 01:40:29,742
Okay, now watch, it takes her about
four seconds to move from there,

1133
01:40:29,777 --> 01:40:31,799
to the front door, so
she's on the older side.

1134
01:40:32,549 --> 01:40:35,135
- What's that up there?
- Uh, those are kids, they're...

1135
01:40:35,170 --> 01:40:37,833
shuffling around, sword fighting
or something, with sticks.

1136
01:40:37,868 --> 01:40:40,311
You can see their height relative to this.
These are cows.

1137
01:40:40,402 --> 01:40:42,486
So, they're probably
between 7 and 9.

1138
01:40:42,521 --> 01:40:45,184
- Boys, definitely.
- Wow, your female's moving fast.

1139
01:40:45,219 --> 01:40:47,779
Okay, that's what I wanted to show you.
Can we pause this please?

1140
01:40:48,245 --> 01:40:49,415
That's not the same lady.

1141
01:40:50,002 --> 01:40:51,312
That's female number three.

1142
01:40:54,095 --> 01:40:57,784
- So you found two males, three females.
- That's correct.

1143
01:41:00,116 --> 01:41:02,891
So, if there are three females,
there ought to be three males.

1144
01:41:03,701 --> 01:41:07,656
Observant Muslim women live with their
parents, or with their husbands.

1145
01:41:08,499 --> 01:41:11,384
We think there's a third
family, living in the house.

1146
01:41:12,295 --> 01:41:15,627
So, this third male that you've
identified as possibly being bin Laden,

1147
01:41:15,662 --> 01:41:17,907
do I give up all hope of ever
seeing a photograph of him?

1148
01:41:18,823 --> 01:41:20,817
Hope? Yeah.

1149
01:41:21,724 --> 01:41:23,734
You give up your
hope, right now.

1150
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:26,509
We scan for heat signatures,

1151
01:41:26,635 --> 01:41:29,702
but we can't validate if it's
a man or a woman up there.

1152
01:41:31,783 --> 01:41:34,451
We talked about burrowing a
pinhole camera, but there's a...

1153
01:41:34,486 --> 01:41:35,939
high risk of discovery.

1154
01:41:38,210 --> 01:41:39,512
We found a safe house,

1155
01:41:39,856 --> 01:41:43,784
but we can't get a vantage point to
fire a telescope over the balcony wall.

1156
01:41:43,819 --> 01:41:46,011
We have explored
the possibility,

1157
01:41:46,046 --> 01:41:48,888
of digging tunnels, of
sending hot air balloons,

1158
01:41:48,923 --> 01:41:53,820
of rerouting supply C-130s to take a
peek, but that might be too alerting.

1159
01:41:54,337 --> 01:41:57,953
We've looked for ways of collecting
available DNA from his trash,

1160
01:41:57,988 --> 01:42:00,619
you know, looking for his toothbrush,
but they burn the trash.

1161
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:04,073
We started a
vaccination program,

1162
01:42:04,798 --> 01:42:07,261
sent a doctor to the house,
see if he could pull blood,

1163
01:42:11,397 --> 01:42:12,861
but that didn't work out.

1164
01:42:14,774 --> 01:42:16,541
We thought about sending
a guy with a bucket,

1165
01:42:16,650 --> 01:42:19,761
to pull a sample from the sewer,
to analyze his fecal matter.

1166
01:42:19,796 --> 01:42:21,402
What was wrong with
that, exactly?

1167
01:42:22,398 --> 01:42:24,143
What was wrong with that?
That, uh...

1168
01:42:25,844 --> 01:42:27,535
The sample would be too diluted.

1169
01:42:28,237 --> 01:42:31,869
And it's asking too much to get a voice
confirmation with him on the phone?

1170
01:42:32,417 --> 01:42:34,818
They don't make telephone
calls from the compound.

1171
01:42:34,853 --> 01:42:36,524
We pulled the cell tower nearby.

1172
01:42:36,826 --> 01:42:41,225
And I'm also going to give up hope that
he might ever get in that white SUV, and

1173
01:42:43,067 --> 01:42:46,152
drive around a bit and
we could see him.

1174
01:42:46,856 --> 01:42:47,990
Don't they get groceries?

1175
01:42:48,532 --> 01:42:51,163
The unidentified third male
does not get groceries.

1176
01:42:51,536 --> 01:42:54,955
He does not leave the compound; He does
not present himself for photographs.

1177
01:42:54,990 --> 01:42:59,635
When he needs fresh air, he paces
around, beneath a grape arbor.

1178
01:43:00,202 --> 01:43:03,468
But the leaves are so thick, they
obscure our satellite views.

1179
01:43:03,502 --> 01:43:07,817
This is a professional
attempt to avoid detection.

1180
01:43:08,389 --> 01:43:10,384
Okay? Real tradecraft.

1181
01:43:11,448 --> 01:43:12,626
The only people we've seen...

1182
01:43:12,661 --> 01:43:15,962
behave in this way, are other
top-level al-Qaeda operatives.

1183
01:43:16,206 --> 01:43:18,211
We did a red team
on your analysis.

1184
01:43:19,058 --> 01:43:23,103
According to them, this behavior could
belong to someone other than al-Qaeda.

1185
01:43:23,138 --> 01:43:26,720
They did give a 40 percent chance
that the unidentified third man...

1186
01:43:26,755 --> 01:43:28,560
is a senior al-Qaeda operative.

1187
01:43:28,968 --> 01:43:32,256
But they also said there's a 35 percent
chance he's a Saudi drug dealer.

1188
01:43:32,569 --> 01:43:34,778
15 percent chance he's a
Kuwaiti arms smuggler.

1189
01:43:34,813 --> 01:43:37,351
10 percent chance he's one of
the relatives of the brothers.

1190
01:43:37,878 --> 01:43:40,264
Basically, we agree with you.
The house screams security.

1191
01:43:40,299 --> 01:43:43,631
It screams someone who wants
privacy; It even screams bad guy.

1192
01:43:43,666 --> 01:43:46,746
- But it does not scream bin Laden.
- You get the point?

1193
01:43:47,199 --> 01:43:50,193
If you can't prove it's bin Laden, at
least prove it's not someone else.

1194
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:52,444
Like a drug dealer.

1195
01:43:57,581 --> 01:44:01,533
You know we lost the ability to prove
them when we lost the Detainee Program.

1196
01:44:01,812 --> 01:44:04,120
Who the hell am I supposed to ask?
Huh?

1197
01:44:05,352 --> 01:44:07,169
Some guy in Gitmo who's
all lawyered up?

1198
01:44:07,204 --> 01:44:09,699
He'll just tell his
lawyer to warn bin Laden.

1199
01:44:13,474 --> 01:44:14,841
You'll think of something.

1200
01:44:32,702 --> 01:44:36,721
He'd be the first successful drug
dealer never to have dealt drugs.

1201
01:44:37,312 --> 01:44:42,278
He has no internet access to the house;
He makes no phone calls either in or out.

1202
01:44:42,313 --> 01:44:46,028
Who's he selling to? Who's he buying from?
How's he making his money?

1203
01:44:46,063 --> 01:44:49,103
And if you were to say, "He's retired,"
I'd say, "Where's the swimming pool?"

1204
01:44:50,133 --> 01:44:52,820
Where's the gold cage
with the falcons?

1205
01:44:54,138 --> 01:44:55,607
And why does he
send his courier...

1206
01:44:55,642 --> 01:44:59,650
to the two cities in Pakistan,
we most associate with al-Qaeda,

1207
01:44:59,685 --> 01:45:02,966
that have nothing particularly
to do with heroin production.

1208
01:45:03,622 --> 01:45:05,911
The president is a
thoughtful, analytical guy.

1209
01:45:05,924 --> 01:45:08,224
He needs proof.

1210
01:45:20,271 --> 01:45:21,840
Go ahead, you guys.

1211
01:45:24,901 --> 01:45:26,567
I gotta say, your job...

1212
01:45:27,202 --> 01:45:28,163
- Hmm.
- Huh.

1213
01:45:29,381 --> 01:45:31,620
I just don't get the
rhythms of politics.

1214
01:45:32,155 --> 01:45:34,780
Oh, you think this is political?
If this was political,

1215
01:45:34,815 --> 01:45:37,938
we'd be having this conversation in
October, when there's an election bump.

1216
01:45:38,436 --> 01:45:44,249
This is pure risk, based on deductive
reasoning, inference, supposition,

1217
01:45:44,284 --> 01:45:47,927
and the only human reporting
you have is six years old,

1218
01:45:47,962 --> 01:45:50,475
from detainees, who were
questioned under duress.

1219
01:45:50,510 --> 01:45:53,224
The political move here is to
tell you to go fuck yourself,

1220
01:45:53,259 --> 01:45:58,857
and remind you, that I was in the room,
when your old boss pitched WMD Iraq.

1221
01:45:59,214 --> 01:46:01,101
At least, there, you guys
brought photographs.

1222
01:46:01,136 --> 01:46:03,928
You know, you're right, I agree
with everything you just said.

1223
01:46:05,383 --> 01:46:07,899
What I meant was, a
man in your position.

1224
01:46:09,262 --> 01:46:12,535
How do you evaluate the risk
of not doing something?

1225
01:46:13,672 --> 01:46:14,406
Hmm?

1226
01:46:15,013 --> 01:46:18,489
The risk of potentially letting bin
Laden slip through your fingers.

1227
01:46:20,173 --> 01:46:21,792
That is a fascinating question.

1228
01:46:26,114 --> 01:46:26,929
Hey.

1229
01:46:32,027 --> 01:46:33,732
I'm not saying
we're gonna do it,

1230
01:46:34,850 --> 01:46:37,582
but the president wants to
know, if we were gonna act,

1231
01:46:38,344 --> 01:46:39,543
how would we do it?

1232
01:46:40,106 --> 01:46:41,429
Give us options.

1233
01:47:16,049 --> 01:47:17,811
Technically, these don't exist.

1234
01:47:18,070 --> 01:47:20,712
I actually tried to kill this
program a couple of times.

1235
01:47:21,942 --> 01:47:24,573
They've gone through, uh, an
initial round of testing,

1236
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:27,662
and they have excellent
radar defeat.

1237
01:47:27,911 --> 01:47:29,773
We just haven't tested
with people in them yet.

1238
01:47:30,810 --> 01:47:34,798
You'll notice these stealth panels,
similar to what we use on the B-2.

1239
01:47:35,134 --> 01:47:37,655
The rotors have been muffled
with decibel killers.

1240
01:47:37,690 --> 01:47:41,351
It's slower than a Black Hawk, lacks
the offense and the stability.

1241
01:47:41,770 --> 01:47:42,908
But, it can hide.

1242
01:47:43,103 --> 01:47:47,433
So, uh, e-excuse me, but what do we-what
do we need this for in-in Libya. I mean,

1243
01:47:47,468 --> 01:47:49,556
Gaddafi's anti-air is
virtually non-existent.

1244
01:47:51,347 --> 01:47:53,487
Maya, do you wanna brief them?

1245
01:48:01,815 --> 01:48:05,741
There are two narratives, about
the location of Osama bin Laden.

1246
01:48:06,046 --> 01:48:07,619
The one that you're
most familiar with,

1247
01:48:07,654 --> 01:48:10,566
is that UBL is hiding in a
cave in the tribal areas.

1248
01:48:10,601 --> 01:48:13,601
That he's surrounded by a large
contingent of loyal fighters.

1249
01:48:14,531 --> 01:48:17,942
But that narrative, is
pre-9/11 understanding of UBL.

1250
01:48:18,467 --> 01:48:21,296
The second narrative, is
that he's living in a city.

1251
01:48:21,958 --> 01:48:25,351
Living in a city with multiple
points of egress and entry,

1252
01:48:25,814 --> 01:48:30,274
Access to communications, so that he can
keep in touch with the organization.

1253
01:48:31,609 --> 01:48:34,979
You can't run a global network of
interconnected cells from a cave.

1254
01:48:35,647 --> 01:48:39,417
We've located an individual, we
believe, based on detainee reporting,

1255
01:48:39,452 --> 01:48:41,041
is bin Laden's courier.

1256
01:48:41,736 --> 01:48:44,507
He's living in a house,
in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

1257
01:48:45,413 --> 01:48:46,856
And we assess,

1258
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:51,459
that one of the other
occupants of the house,

1259
01:48:51,830 --> 01:48:53,191
is UBL.

1260
01:49:04,586 --> 01:49:05,505
General.

1261
01:49:13,630 --> 01:49:14,484
Excuse me.

1262
01:49:15,582 --> 01:49:19,062
Uh, so, UBL, you got-you got
an intel source on the ground?

1263
01:49:21,734 --> 01:49:23,763
- No.
- No?

1264
01:49:25,155 --> 01:49:27,218
Okay, so how do you
know it's bin Laden?

1265
01:49:28,301 --> 01:49:29,968
'Cause the truth is, we've
been on this op before.

1266
01:49:30,003 --> 01:49:33,038
It was '07, and it wasn't bin Laden,
and we lost a couple of guys.

1267
01:49:33,502 --> 01:49:34,507
Totally understand.

1268
01:49:34,736 --> 01:49:37,351
Bin Laden uses a courier, to
interact with the outside world.

1269
01:49:37,386 --> 01:49:40,075
By locating the courier,
we've located bin Laden.

1270
01:49:40,155 --> 01:49:41,489
That's really the intel.

1271
01:49:42,530 --> 01:49:43,412
That's it?

1272
01:49:44,376 --> 01:49:46,349
Quite frankly, I didn't
even wanna use you guys.

1273
01:49:46,384 --> 01:49:48,458
With your dip and your velcro
and all your gear bullshit.

1274
01:49:48,493 --> 01:49:49,723
I wanted to drop a bomb.

1275
01:49:50,275 --> 01:49:52,897
But people didn't believe in
this lead enough to drop a bomb.

1276
01:49:53,372 --> 01:49:55,883
So, they're using you
guys, as canaries,

1277
01:49:56,018 --> 01:49:59,295
in a theory that if bin Laden
isn't there, you can sneak away,

1278
01:49:59,330 --> 01:50:01,393
- and no one will be the wiser.
- Hmm.

1279
01:50:01,965 --> 01:50:04,176
But bin Laden, is there.

1280
01:50:06,377 --> 01:50:08,084
And you're gonna
kill him for me.

1281
01:50:13,597 --> 01:50:14,597
They're nervous downtown.

1282
01:50:15,811 --> 01:50:18,411
I don't think we'll get an approval.
This decision is not going...

1283
01:50:32,421 --> 01:50:33,761
It's her against the world.

1284
01:50:34,728 --> 01:50:35,843
Oh, yeah.

1285
01:50:39,437 --> 01:50:41,817
I'm about to go look the
president in the eye.

1286
01:50:42,515 --> 01:50:45,334
And what I'd like to know,
no fucking bullshit,

1287
01:50:46,019 --> 01:50:47,893
is where everyone
stands on this thing.

1288
01:50:48,979 --> 01:50:53,890
Now, very simply, is he there,
or is he not fucking there?

1289
01:50:55,469 --> 01:50:58,561
We all come at this, through the
filter of our own past experiences.

1290
01:50:58,741 --> 01:51:02,558
Now I remember Iraq WMD, very clearly.
I fronted that.

1291
01:51:02,593 --> 01:51:05,863
And I can tell you the case for that,
was much stronger than this case.

1292
01:51:05,898 --> 01:51:07,393
A fucking "yes" or a "no".

1293
01:51:07,804 --> 01:51:10,312
We don't deal in certainty,
we deal in probability.

1294
01:51:10,347 --> 01:51:14,185
And I'd say there's a 60 percent
probability he's there.

1295
01:51:17,298 --> 01:51:19,478
I concur, 60 percent.

1296
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:24,369
I'm at 80 percent, their
OPSEC is what convinces me.

1297
01:51:26,633 --> 01:51:29,849
- You guys ever agree on anything?
- Well, I agree with Mike.

1298
01:51:30,483 --> 01:51:32,526
We're basing this mostly
on detainee reporting,

1299
01:51:32,561 --> 01:51:37,298
and I spent a bunch of time in those rooms.
I'd say it's a soft 60, sir.

1300
01:51:37,888 --> 01:51:40,425
I'm virtually certain there's
some high value target there,

1301
01:51:40,460 --> 01:51:42,091
I'm just not sure
it's bin Laden.

1302
01:51:44,377 --> 01:51:47,200
Well, this is a little bit
of a cluster fuck, isn't it?

1303
01:51:48,637 --> 01:51:50,156
I'd like to know
what Maya thinks.

1304
01:51:50,191 --> 01:51:52,275
We're all incorporating
her assessment into ours.

1305
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:53,976
A hundred percent he's there.

1306
01:51:56,654 --> 01:51:59,458
Okay, fine, 95 percent 'cause I
know certainty freaks you guys out,

1307
01:51:59,493 --> 01:52:01,075
but it's a hundred.

1308
01:52:15,731 --> 01:52:16,929
They're all cowed.

1309
01:52:20,756 --> 01:52:23,714
- What do you think of the girl?
- I think she's fucking smart.

1310
01:52:24,675 --> 01:52:26,426
We're all smart, Jeremy.

1311
01:52:34,587 --> 01:52:35,842
May I join you?

1312
01:52:40,006 --> 01:52:41,751
How is the food
down here anyway?

1313
01:52:42,834 --> 01:52:43,927
Uh, it's okay.

1314
01:52:45,406 --> 01:52:48,699
- How long have you worked for the CIA?
- Twelve years.

1315
01:52:48,943 --> 01:52:52,138
- I was recruited out of high school.
- And do you know why we did that?

1316
01:52:52,848 --> 01:52:54,416
I don't think I can answer
that question, sir.

1317
01:52:54,429 --> 01:52:56,008
I don't think I'm...

1318
01:52:56,043 --> 01:52:58,181
allowed to... answer.

1319
01:52:58,797 --> 01:52:59,724
All right.

1320
01:53:01,953 --> 01:53:05,342
What else have you done for
us, besides bin Laden?

1321
01:53:06,625 --> 01:53:07,660
Nothing.

1322
01:53:09,343 --> 01:53:10,671
I've done nothing else.

1323
01:53:13,885 --> 01:53:15,725
Well, you certainly
have a flair for it.

1324
01:53:44,771 --> 01:53:45,517
No?

1325
01:53:46,679 --> 01:53:47,428
Yeah.

1326
01:53:48,298 --> 01:53:49,535
All right, let's be serious now.

1327
01:53:49,570 --> 01:53:51,564
Yeah don't fuck around
on this one, dude.

1328
01:53:51,962 --> 01:53:54,442
You're just fuckin' around, 'cause
you see I'm up by two games.

1329
01:53:54,496 --> 01:53:55,381
How many you got?

1330
01:54:05,911 --> 01:54:07,178
Patrick, be honest with me.

1331
01:54:07,983 --> 01:54:09,411
You really believe this story?

1332
01:54:11,234 --> 01:54:14,374
I mean, no offense, no
offense, I know, but,

1333
01:54:14,905 --> 01:54:16,501
Osama bin Laden?

1334
01:54:18,272 --> 01:54:20,543
- Yeah.
- What part convinced you?

1335
01:54:22,901 --> 01:54:23,951
Her confidence.

1336
01:54:24,987 --> 01:54:28,266
That's the kinda, concrete
data point I'm looking for.

1337
01:54:28,836 --> 01:54:29,684
I tell you, buddy.

1338
01:54:29,811 --> 01:54:31,002
Her confidence is
the one thing...

1339
01:54:31,037 --> 01:54:33,152
that's keeping me from getting
ass-raped in some Pakistani prison.

1340
01:54:33,187 --> 01:54:34,572
I'm gonna be honest
with you, bro.

1341
01:54:37,057 --> 01:54:38,016
I'm cool with it.

1342
01:54:45,352 --> 01:54:46,079
Yeah.

1343
01:54:46,939 --> 01:54:49,901
<i>Maya, I wanted you
to hear it first.</i>

1344
01:54:50,748 --> 01:54:52,282
You know that thing
we talked about?

1345
01:54:52,317 --> 01:54:53,204
<i>It's gonna happen.</i>

1346
01:54:53,371 --> 01:54:55,384
- When?
- Tonight.

1347
01:54:57,444 --> 01:54:58,378
<i>Good luck.</i>

1348
01:54:58,998 --> 01:55:00,234
- Fifty bucks?
- Fifty bucks.

1349
01:55:00,673 --> 01:55:02,031
- Fifty bucks?
- Representing.

1350
01:55:02,657 --> 01:55:03,542
Fifty bucks.

1351
01:55:08,241 --> 01:55:09,290
It's a lucky shot.

1352

You should listen to it. I
got plans for after this.

Big time. I wanna talk
to all of you about it.

02:19:47,706 --> 02:19:49,659
This is a gold mine, I
need more time than that.

1514
02:19:49,906 --> 02:19:52,558
Echo Zero-Five, if you're
not at the LZ at 4 Mikes,

1515
02:19:52,593 --> 02:19:54,026
I'm gonna leave your ass behind.

1516
02:19:54,238 --> 02:19:56,591
<i>The Paks have
scrambled the F-16s.</i>

1517
02:19:57,184 --> 02:19:57,964
Four!

1518
02:19:57,999 --> 02:19:59,027
Minutes!

1519
02:20:14,215 --> 02:20:16,598
<i>Red Five-Two, inbound for LZ.</i>

1520
02:20:38,978 --> 02:20:40,115
Where do you need the bag?

1521
02:20:40,504 --> 02:20:41,530
<i>Third deck.</i>

1522
02:20:58,901 --> 02:20:59,611
Here!

1523
02:20:59,819 --> 02:21:00,521
Hey.

1524
02:21:16,045 --> 02:21:16,747
Get it up.

1525
02:21:23,071 --> 02:21:24,302
All right, let's move it out.

1526
02:21:35,861 --> 02:21:37,211
Let's go! Now!

1527
02:22:01,491 --> 02:22:03,760
<i>You've got one Mike to
blow that downed helo.</i>

1528
02:22:40,719 --> 02:22:42,135
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1529
02:23:08,495 --> 02:23:11,913
<i>Kilo-Red Forty-Six inbound for
LZ in thirty seconds, out.</i>

1530
02:23:13,390 --> 02:23:15,742
<i>Chopper Four-Six, we
were demoing Five-One.</i>

1531
02:23:16,348 --> 02:23:17,923
<i>Chopper Four-Six, wave off.</i>

1532
02:23:19,599 --> 02:23:21,561
<i>Four-Six, wave off, wave off!</i>

1533
02:25:27,462 --> 02:25:28,167
Up!

1534
02:25:34,954 --> 02:25:36,266
Whoo-oo-oo!

1535
02:25:39,925 --> 02:25:42,585
- Well done, Patrick.
- Thank you.

1536
02:25:43,315 --> 02:25:44,225
Moving through!

1537
02:25:44,260 --> 02:25:45,926
All right, listen up, gentlemen.
Read the signs.

1538
02:25:45,961 --> 02:25:49,234
1st Floor! Hard drives,
files, anything!

1539
02:25:49,269 --> 02:25:52,153
2nd Floor! Opposite,
down on the right!

1540
02:25:53,326 --> 02:25:55,030
3rd Floor, ladies' underwear.

1541
02:25:56,649 --> 02:25:57,709
We're on strike,
they can't be...

1542
02:25:57,744 --> 02:25:59,201
- that many of 'em, right?
- Collect all media!

1543
02:25:59,236 --> 02:26:01,579
- CDs, DVDs?
- Who's got a Sharpie?

1544
02:26:04,559 --> 02:26:06,671
- Right here.
- Good job, man.

1545
02:26:18,812 --> 02:26:19,676
Nice job.

1546
02:26:23,835 --> 02:26:24,873
Where the hard drives go?

1547
02:26:24,908 --> 02:26:27,489
- Guys, marker on tables!
- Yes, sir.

1548
02:26:27,524 --> 02:26:30,057
We got Ziploc bags and
Sharpies use them.

1549
02:26:31,696 --> 02:26:33,130
You all, mark all media!

1550
02:26:35,296 --> 02:26:37,920
- Gentlemen, watch your backs.
- Slow down.

1551
02:26:39,297 --> 02:26:40,038
Thank you, sir.

1552
02:26:40,177 --> 02:26:40,877
Good job.

1553
02:26:40,912 --> 02:26:42,178
- Slow down.
- Video cameras?

1554
02:26:42,285 --> 02:26:44,534
Video cameras, where-where
was it found?

1555
02:26:53,152 --> 02:26:54,056
Yes, sir.

1556
02:26:54,579 --> 02:26:55,685
One moment, please.

1557
02:27:09,105 --> 02:27:10,216
One moment, please.

1558
02:27:39,388 --> 02:27:42,503
Sir, the agency expert
gave visual confirmation.

1559
02:27:43,161 --> 02:27:46,502
Yes, sir, the girl. Hundred percent.
Thank you, sir.

1560
02:28:43,188 --> 02:28:45,344
- Are you Maya?
- Yeah.

1561
02:28:45,551 --> 02:28:47,160
That's the only
name they gave me.

1562
02:28:47,195 --> 02:28:50,254
You can sit wherever you want,
you're the only one on the manifest.

1563
02:28:53,847 --> 02:28:55,633
You must be pretty important.

1564
02:28:56,411 --> 02:28:58,411
You got the whole
plane to yourself.

1565
02:28:59,411 --> 02:29:01,411
Where do you wanna go?

1566
02:30:08,411 --> 02:30:13,411
