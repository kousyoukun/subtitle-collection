1341
01:30:32,969 --> 01:30:35,597
Uh, can you just hold the line, please?

1342
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:37,974
I need a picket line along the GT highway

and men spaced at intervals along the road and at every exit.

或者是一個叫做阿伯塔巴德的中型城市 或者喀什米爾附近

1351
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:48,753
Kashmir's interesting because it's a way station for the Tribals.

從犯人那裡知道阿布·法拉赫在2003年曾經在那裡住過

The good news is he's driving a white SUV.
好消息是他開著一輛SUV

01:32:01,266 --> 01:32:03,601
SUVs are actually pretty rare in Pakistan.
在巴基斯坦SUV不常見

1356
01:32:04,561 --> 01:32:07,981
If he was driving a sedan or a compact, we'd be fucked.
如果他開的是小車 我們可費勁了

1357
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:10,650
Obviously, this assumes he doesn't change vehicles.

once you're on their list, you never get off.

01:33:48,122 --> 01:33:51,376
Next time, there may not be bulletproof glass to save you.

1368
01:33:53,795 --> 01:33:57,006
We'll keep up on the surveillance as best we can.

1380
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:14,394
- and did services for him.  - Mmm-hmm.

We lost him for seven years.

所以 他們會問如果本拉登就在那裡

1389
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:47,135
is the Pak military with him?
巴軍方會不會與他為伍?

1390
01:36:47,218 --> 01:36:49,637
The question isn't, "Are the Paks protecting bin Laden?"
而不是問 "巴軍是不是為本拉登提供保護?"

1391
01:36:49,721 --> 01:36:52,890
The question is, "Would he allow himself to be protected by the Paks?"
問題是 "他會允許巴軍保護他嗎?"
