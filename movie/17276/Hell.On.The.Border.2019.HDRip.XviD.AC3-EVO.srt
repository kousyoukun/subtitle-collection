00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:42,554
For a second there,

3
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,757
I thought I finally done
enough to see Glory.

4
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,629
But my senses is telling me
you ain't no angels.

5
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,664
Well, you add a few wrinkles,
take away a little hair,

6
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,933
why, it looks like
we got Charlie Storm.

7
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,501
Cow rustler, spirit pusher.

8
00:03:56,503 --> 00:04:00,672
Mr. Lawman, I'm not exactly
well here right now.

9
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,908
Give me a little assistance
getting out of this mire

10
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,411
and I'll turn myself in
nice and peaceful like.

11
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,780
Well, why don't you just
get down and walk out?

12
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,682
I'll arrange someone
to get your mare.

13
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:14,319
Damn, if I could walk
out of here on my own strength,

14
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,521
you'd be having this conversation
with only my horse here,

15
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:17,689
not me.

16
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,625
What do you surmise, Bass?

17
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:23,729
One of us will have to
bring him out of that pit.

18
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:24,830
Well, you heard the man.

19
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,031
If he could walk in that,

20
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,033
he'd be somewhere dancing
with the savages.

21
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:31,036
Besides, I ain't dressed
for this occasion.

22
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,641
See here,

23
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:39,411
what I was trying to say is...

24
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,580
I'd walk through,

25
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:44,383
carry him across my shoulders
back to you for the iron.

26
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:46,752
So, you're gonna walk
seven paces out there,

27
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:48,954
in mud that a horse
can't walk in?

28
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,756
Yes, sir.

29
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,958
Well, if you say it,
I wanna see it.

30
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,594
Marshal, you gonna let that nigger
kill himself and me in the process?

31
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,529
You need to watch
your mouth, old man.

32
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,498
And Mr. Reeves here,
he may be a Negro,

33
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,899
but he's my posseman.

34
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,968
And he may be the one
just saves your neck.

35
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,070
- I ain't going.
- Oh, you going.

36
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:07,839
- Oh, I ain't going.
- If'n he makes it out there to you,

37
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,441
you very well gonna
get on his shoulders

38
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:10,742
and make your way
back over here.

39
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:14,379
No, I won't.
I'm good right here.

40
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,781
Above ground
and breathing.

41
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:17,649
That little nigger,
he's gonna sink,

42
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,651
and he gonna sink
with me in it.

43
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,654
Quite frankly, I don't really
care if you survive or not.

44
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,057
Right here it says
"dead or alive."

45
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:27,059
And, Mr. Reeves,

46
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:28,860
why don't you try and not sink

47
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,997
before you get within
arm's shot of this bank here.

48
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:35,334
I don't suspect mud
is going to remove from my linens very well.

49
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,404
Marshal,

50
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,506
you better fix my obit right.

51
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,710
"The outlaw Charlie Storm,

52
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:48,380
the most wanted outlaw
in the Indian Territory,

53
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:53,352
took a fight on with eight
U.S. Marshals and sixteen possemen."

54
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,735
You sure you can get me
out of this thing?

55
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,832
Well, I'll be.

56
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,578
Now, Charlie Storm.
Charlie Storm.

57
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,213
Yep.

58
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:31,149
By the power vested in me...

59
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:35,921
from the federal judge
Isaac Parker,

60
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,689
I place you under arrest.

61
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,127
Let's go, Bass.

62
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,900
What is it now?

63
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,970
Think I'ma help that mare.

64
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,172
Help it do what?

65
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,708
Help it out.

66
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,176
You know we can't
wait on you.

67
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,613
Let's go, Charlie.

68
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,775
The outlaws here are unruly.

69
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,177
The only solution
to that unruliness is the rule of law.

70
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,779
The law that you were
brought here to dispense.

71
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,189
Judge Isaac C. Parker...

72
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:49,694
is there a man out of
the ones that you sentenced

73
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:53,031
that didn't make a victim out
of an innocent man or woman?

74
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:58,637
No, you can bring
me the final pardon request

75
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,206
for the man that
killed his friend.

76
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:23,228
Shouldn't I have
a counselor with me?

77
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,666
I do not care to speak with you
about your legal status.

78
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,001
The purpose of my inquiry today

79
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:33,071
is to endeavor to speak with you
about softening your heart

80
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:37,242
in preparation for your
inevitable meeting with God.

81
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,145
You shot your best friend
in the back.

82
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:42,847
And it will not be long
before you leave this world

83
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:45,116
and enter into eternity.

84
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,619
Now, I cannot
have mercy on you,

85
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:50,622
but there is one who can
pardon your offenses.

86
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:53,959
There is a savior whose blood
is sufficient enough

87
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:56,795
to wash this stain
from your soul.

88
00:09:56,797 --> 00:10:00,165
Now, I beg of you to seek
the salvation of His holy cross.

89
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:03,301
Because I cannot, and I
shall not pardon your crimes.

90
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:06,037
May God have mercy on you.

91
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,313
I didn't realize at the fort there would be
so much unruly activity.

92
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:20,986
Well, you know today is the day
that Judge Parker is gonna send

93
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:23,655
six souls to meet
their maker.

94
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:26,257
Six? At one time?

95
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:29,060
Judge Parker relishes on efficiency.

96
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:31,896
What kind of man hangs six men
in the name of efficiency?

97
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:34,199
Sounds more like
an outlaw than the law.

98
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,268
The law he is.

99
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,704
He passed the bar exam
when he was 21.

100
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,640
He was a city attorney at 23.

101
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,642
He left the Democrats
'cause he opposed slavery.

102
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,210
Yeah.

103
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:47,812
All that speak he speaks.

104
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:51,383
Only thing I can remember
is he hung six souls.

105
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:02,994
- Morning, Judge.
- Morning.

106
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:06,097
It's Charlie Storm here.
He's ready for his arraignment.

107
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:27,018
Marshal, your prisoner
is covered in mud,

108
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,988
yet you remain pristine.

109
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,290
Well, you know a good marshal
know how to bring his man in

110
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:35,160
without sacrificing his stature.

111
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,462
- You understand.
- Very well.

112
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:40,765
Bring him to the jailer's.
I'll arraign him tomorrow.

113
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,901
Before noon, around 11:00.

114
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,824
Y'all leave me the fuck alone.

115
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:29,347
You know the colored man
Bass Reeves?

116
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:32,250
Eh, no,
I can't say I do.

117
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,753
He broke away from
his master during the war.

118
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,988
Learned the land, their native
tongue before coming here,

119
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,793
and, well, Mr. Reeves has been
a posseman for a few years now.

120
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:44,362
I reckon it's time
for a promotion.

121
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:51,136
You want me to promote
a Negro to deputy marshal?

122
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:53,138
Yes, I do.

123
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,507
Why do you incessantly push me

124
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,408
to do things that are sure
to get me fired?

125
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,778
I'm doing
no such a thing.

126
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,881
I'm your assistant,
and I'm assisting you.

127
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:06,151
You'd do well just to listen.

128
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:08,086
You know as well as I do,

129
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:11,389
this country, as progressive
as it pretends to be,

130
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,458
is not ready
for a colored marshal.

131
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,294
These people, they can
only handle so much change.

132
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:23,568
Bass and my Archie
homesteaded land together.

133
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,804
He'd have told ya,

134
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,940
you won't find a man
more capable with a pistol.

135
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:32,143
I'll tell ya you won't find
a man more loyal to the law.

136
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,582
That's the kind
of deputy you need.

137
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,820
Evening, Bass.

138
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,521
Evening, Jessie.

139
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:46,591
You know Judge Parker?

140
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,293
Yes, ma'am.

141
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,963
Evening, sir.

142
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:53,898
Evening.

143
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,371
I'll be seeing you.

144
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,147
You're one of our possemen,
are you not?

145
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:14,219
Yes, sir.

146
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:17,021
How did you and that horse
find the occasion

147
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,224
to be so stained
by mud?

148
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:22,627
You'd have to ask
Marshal Franks, sir.

149
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,629
As a federal judge,

150
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,998
I'm inquiring of you now, sir.

151
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,200
And, frankly,
I expect nothing less

152
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,069
than a straight
answer here.

153
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:38,209
With all respect due you,

154
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,645
Marshal Franks
is the man I ride for.

155
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:45,617
I will give you $20 federal salary

156
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:48,052
if you speak
plainly to me, sir.

157
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,891
Judge, there is not
a dollar amount

158
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,126
that will cause me
to betray my employer.

159
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,430
Oh, come on. I employ him.

160
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,666
He employs you.

161
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:04,269
So, technically, I employ you.

162
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,671
What does he pay you anyway?

163
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:09,007
What, $3 a week?

164
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,577
I'm offering you 20
to tell me about a horse.

165
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:20,018
I guess I just don't
see it that way, sir.

166
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:25,123
Miss Jessie.

167
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,496
You care to hear
something humorous?

168
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:33,398
I was with Franks today,

169
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,633
and he was spit-shine clean.

170
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:40,371
But his prisoner was covered
about like you and that horse.

171
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,941
When I mentioned
that fact to him,

172
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,576
he failed to even acknowledge you.

173
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,578
Or your name.

174
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:58,623
Good Lord, in Jesus's name,

175
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,125
let me know that I'm doing
the right thing out here.

176
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:16,607
Wait.

177
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,613
I firmly believe that
it's been appointed to men to live and die but once.

178
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:25,483
Yet before me stands the soul

179
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,219
that I know has departed
from this place.

180
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,288
You killed my brother.

181
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:34,993
No, wait.
I did no such thing.

182
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:40,565
Now, your brother,
he did what he did.

183
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,334
He got justice.

184
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,536
Don't do this.

185
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:00,218
Oh, please, God...

186
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,462
Came back to apologize
for being rude.

187
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,631
Are you Creek?

188
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:23,441
I'm not a boy.

189
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,176
I'm Rufus Buck.

190
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,447
Rufus Buck.

191
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,624
Lord above.

192
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:50,728
Jessie was right about you.

193
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,232
She didn't
exaggerate at all.

194
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,634
I've never seen a man
utilize his armaments

195
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,670
with such speed and efficiency.

196
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:02,540
I mean, you had that boy dead
to rights and you just let him go.

197
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,279
Thank you.

198
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:13,651
What's wrong, sir?

199
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,523
Sir, I'm not a lawman.

200
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,827
And some of those folks was white.

201
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,931
You were witness.

202
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,401
Well, they drew first.

203
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:33,437
On you and me.

204
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,773
You're damn right
I'm a witness.

205
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,775
So be it.

206
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,413
If you the witness,
who gonna be the judge?

207
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,858
Well, there may be a solution.

208
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:13,638
Bass...

209
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,343
Bass?

210
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:29,480
What's wrong?

211
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:35,086
I think I'm...

212
00:22:35,088 --> 00:22:37,455
I might be a deputy marshal.

213
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,429
You what?

214
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,866
Bass...

215
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:54,739
You put a star on your chest,
you the target.

216
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:57,675
I've always been the target.
It's no difference.

217
00:22:57,677 --> 00:22:59,810
You trying to make
a widow of me?

218
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,846
- I'll just leave right now and save you the trouble.
- No, I'm not trying--

219
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:04,048
Let go of me,
Bass George Reeves.

220
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,983
Let me alone.

221
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:09,954
We doing just fine
with you on the farm

222
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:12,423
and walking with the marshal
on occasion.

223
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:15,459
Why now, Bass? Why?

224
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,395
Why?

225
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:22,633
'Cause we got six souls
sleeping in the next room.

226
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:36,106
All right, you three go around
back and we'll flank the front.

227
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:38,142
Wait.

228
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,579
Look, Jim, I know
we done come all this way,

229
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:46,116
but I think it's wise for us
to call somebody to assist us.

230
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:48,786
Since when did you
go yellowbelly?

231
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:50,955
I ain't no yellowbelly,
my friend.

232
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:54,525
but you've heard the same
stories that I've heard about Dozier.

233
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:59,029
Six of us here, that ain't
enough to bring him in.

234
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,764
You see this?

235
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,833
You see those words?

236
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,035
That says
"United States Deputy Marshal."

237
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:07,238
I am the United States.

238
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,206
And we, as the United States,

239
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,275
are gonna go in there
and we're gonna take Dozier

240
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:13,577
back to Judge Parker
to answer for his crimes.

241
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:16,680
And if any of you
are yellow like Tom,

242
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,282
you can just go somewhere
and bury your face

243
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:20,584
'cause your country
doesn't need you.

244
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:25,055
You see it like you want,
but I'm going home.

245
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:29,827
Judge is gonna have
your head for this.

246
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:33,664
Maybe, but he might have yours
for not listening to reason.

247
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:42,840
You two go around back.

248
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:47,645
Just the five of us?

249
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:50,581
- It's one man, Ned.
- I know.

250
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,288
Bob Dozier!

251
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,758
United States
Deputy Marshal Jim Bruce!

252
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,160
I have a warrant for your arrest

253
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:06,664
out of the District Court
Fort Smith, Arkansas.

254
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:10,267
Your house is surrounded.

255
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:12,770
Turn yourself in now,

256
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:15,806
won't be unnecessary
spilling of your blood.

257
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:20,978
Bob Dozier.

258
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:25,049
- United States Deputy--
- Dozier: I heard you cackle!

259
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:27,284
Repeating yourself is not gonna
endo you anymore jurisdiction

260
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:29,653
over me or my person
than it did the first time.

261
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,855
You might not have heard,

262
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:35,359
but the United States
has jurisdiction over the Indian Territory.

263
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:37,628
And this is the Indian Territory.

264
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,697
- That right?
- Yeah.

265
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:42,600
How's your government get jurisdiction
over land it don't own?

266
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:46,203
- Pardon?
- This land belongs to the Indian.

267
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:48,305
Savages.

268
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:50,841
Seems to me the Indians should
be giving you jurisdiction.

269
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:52,876
Seeing as you stole
every piece of land from them,

270
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:53,944
you forced them on this territory,

271
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,646
I don't see them doing so.

272
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:57,081
Sir, you must be mistaken.

273
00:26:57,083 --> 00:27:00,150
The government
doesn't ask for permission.

274
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:02,052
We are the United States,

275
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:03,821
and we are advising you
to come on out,

276
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:05,856
or we're coming in
there after you.

277
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:17,301
I dare you.

278
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:26,243
Well, go get him.

279
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:48,866
Is anyone left?

280
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:53,203
Oh, yes,

281
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:57,007
United States
Deputy Marshal Jim Bruce,

282
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,776
someone is left.

283
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:09,119
I told you you do not have
jurisdiction over me or my person.

284
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:12,456
Yet you still choose to
awaken me from my slumber.

285
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,825
Cause a ruckus
in my town.

286
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:23,333
Tell me something,
Deputy Marshal Jim Bruce,

287
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:26,136
what do you do when a rodent
invades your home?

288
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,980
That question was not
designed to be rhetorical.

289
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,752
- You kill it?
- Yes!

290
00:28:41,754 --> 00:28:44,054
You just don't kill it.

291
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,223
You kill it and you send it
back to where it came from

292
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,792
so that all the other rodents
see what happens

293
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:51,128
they get the same idea.

294
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:02,439
Gather the coins that
he and the others carry.

295
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:05,142
Put 'em with the gains
from last night's coach.

296
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:07,945
We'll give it to
the families that need it.

297
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:10,781
Keep the rest
so we may eat.

298
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,854
I apologize to
the women and children

299
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:18,756
who had to witness
that defense of self.

300
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:24,328
Bring him to the vault.

301
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,364
Bring me my knife.

302
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:36,507
You, government man,

303
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:39,943
are gonna deliver
a message for me.

304
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:43,814
It needs to be unmistakable.
Look at me.

305
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:46,283
Can you do that?

306
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:55,058
Senator Smith.

307
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:59,129
Word reached that you might be
slumbering in these parts.

308
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,465
And I heard
there are several souls

309
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:05,102
that slumber in these parts
at the hand of a black man.

310
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:08,939
One of those gentlemen
was white.

311
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:14,344
Now, you know that even here,
as progressive as we may be,

312
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:17,047
a Negro cannot shoot
a white man

313
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,982
without the protection
of a shield.

314
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:23,020
Is that what we call a white man
that ambushes a judge,

315
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:25,322
- a gentleman?
- You miss my meaning.

316
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,457
No, never mind, because I intend

317
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:30,093
to name that man deputy marshal.

318
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:33,297
Retroactively protecting
his bravery last night.

319
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:40,871
You do realize that
if you name that Negro,

320
00:30:40,873 --> 00:30:42,606
the one that lacks
the good sense

321
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:45,209
not to shoot down
a white man and he fails,

322
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:47,477
it will be a setback
for the whole Negro race.

323
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,980
- Senator, let me tell you--
- No, no, you hear me out.

324
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:52,482
You hear me out.

325
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:56,386
I nominated you because
I trust your judgment.

326
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:59,489
President Grant believes
in liberty of the Negro.

327
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:02,292
He is fighting that unrest
in the South.

328
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:06,196
But in order to
protect our progress,

329
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:09,433
we have to nurture the Negro.

330
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:13,170
Not just set 'em fully free.

331
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:16,306
I mean,
they're ready to be free,

332
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:18,275
but are they ready to lead?

333
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:20,310
And if he fails,

334
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:23,580
there's likely not to be another
one around for 100 years.

335
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:27,551
So, can you tell me just
what it is about this Negro

336
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:30,554
that makes you believe that he
is worthy to carry that burden?

337
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:35,425
Well, I don't know if it's fair

338
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:38,362
to hoist the burden of an entire
race upon his shoulders.

339
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:45,202
Your Honor,

340
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:48,305
- I know you to be a man of the church.
- Yes, sir.

341
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:51,942
- And the law.
- Mm-hmm.

342
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:55,312
But are you willing to gamble
your seat on the bench for that man?

343
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:57,047
I never gamble.

344
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,159
Deputy Marshal Reeves.

345
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:13,931
Well done, sir.

346
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:25,142
Judge, I'm sorry, but I've
buried my words far too long.

347
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:27,577
Now, I fancy Mr. Reeves here
as a posseman.

348
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:31,181
And you know I do,
but you bring a dishonor--

349
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:34,217
a dishonor on the name of
the marshal by naming him.

350
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:37,487
Franks, Negro or not,
in the course of a day,

351
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:39,489
I've known this man
to rescue a horse,

352
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:41,591
rescue an outlaw,
and bring him to justice,

353
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:44,294
save a judge from perish
from five men,

354
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:47,230
and refuse a payment worth
many times his monthly salary

355
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:49,466
simply to provide information.

356
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,703
Now, if those actions
do not quality that man there

357
00:32:52,705 --> 00:32:56,039
to ride as a deputy marshal
in my district,

358
00:32:56,041 --> 00:33:00,143
then I might just pull
the stars off every man here.

359
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:03,513
- Judge, you're making--
- Including yours.

360
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:06,717
Man: No outlaw will file
for a black man with a badge.

361
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:08,618
He'll be dead in a week.
Save them kids.

362
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,555
Who said that?
Now, there will be order in this court.

363
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:13,623
I'll clear this whole gallery.

364
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:17,094
Delivery here Judge Parker.

365
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:19,129
- I'm Judge Parker. Just set it there.
- Yes, sir. Okay. Yes, sir.

366
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,466
Judge, you may not know,

367
00:33:22,468 --> 00:33:24,401
why, Mr. Reeves here,
he can't read.

368
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:27,337
And if he can't read,
well, he can't write.

369
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:31,608
Is that right, Bass?

370
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:37,447
That's right, sir.

371
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:42,119
Can you tell me how is it
that you come to shoot

372
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:44,721
like a man possessed
but you can't read?

373
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:48,692
My generation
was not born free.

374
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:51,561
My master taught
me to shoot,

375
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:54,231
but he refused
to teach me to read.

376
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:58,502
Said that have
made me too dangerous.

377
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:01,538
More dangerous than you are
with those Colts?

378
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:07,577
Well,
how in God's good name

379
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:09,679
is he going to read a warrant

380
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:12,549
and ensure that he brings in
the right man?

381
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:16,219
We don't need litigation
by negligence

382
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,055
caused by a Negro.

383
00:34:19,825 --> 00:34:23,460
- Um...
- Man: Tell him, Marshal Franks.

384
00:34:30,836 --> 00:34:35,205
My husband may not read...

385
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:40,210
but you will respect him.

386
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:45,215
My husband Bass

387
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:48,151
can be and will be

388
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:52,189
a deputy worth remembering.

389
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,861
Okay, now,
we've heard you.

390
00:34:57,863 --> 00:34:59,563
We'll have order in this court.

391
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,670
May I?

392
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:08,505
Bass, you know
I can't do that.

393
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:12,509
There are no coloreds
allowed in the bar.

394
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:20,577
What is that awful smell
in my courtroom?

395
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:39,496
Judge, I suspect the smell

396
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:42,465
is coming from this here package.

397
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:43,967
Open it up.

398
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:55,845
Judge, you ain't gonna like it.

399
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:57,747
It's horrible, Judge, horrible.

400
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,583
Jeez.

401
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:21,538
That head was a promise.

402
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,574
It was a promise,
and it was a promise fulfilled.

403
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,643
Now, you let him
stay where he is.

404
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:28,378
Should he make his way
into town,

405
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,779
then you let the law
have its way with him.

406
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:31,982
Bruce went on a fool's errand.

407
00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:33,783
and he returned home
slight of his body.

408
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:37,988
Well, be that as it may...

409
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:42,826
is there anyone here...

410
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,564
who will execute service of
this here warrant?

411
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:52,269
Anyone?

412
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:55,772
No one...

413
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,575
under the authority
of this court here

414
00:37:58,577 --> 00:38:01,578
shall stand above the law.

415
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,747
Judge, ain't nobody ill
enough in their right mind

416
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:05,282
to take on that assignment.

417
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:06,850
You chase an animal
in its own habitat,

418
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:08,385
and it's simply suicide.

419
00:38:08,387 --> 00:38:10,420
I will.

420
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:14,891
Oh, that's good.

421
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,832
Mr. Reeves...

422
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:26,536
you aren't a deputy.

423
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:29,639
It seems, sir, that we both have
a problem and a solution.

424
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:35,879
You need someone to put an end
to Dozier's terror,

425
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:40,350
and I need to prove I would be
a more-than-capable deputy.

426
00:38:40,352 --> 00:38:43,019
Both problems solved
by the same solution.

427
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,491
If I can bring him back,
you put a badge on my chest.

428
00:38:51,797 --> 00:38:54,030
So this man here,

429
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:58,635
who many of you feel isn't worthy
enough to strap your boots,

430
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:02,972
this man has more courage
than any of you all combined.

431
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:08,978
Now, if I grant this request...

432
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,350
is there anybody
that will ride with him?

433
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:17,487
- I ride alone.
- No, Mr. Reeves.

434
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:19,823
As much as it might be
your inclination to do so,

435
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:21,691
you will not ride alone.

436
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,027
My orders.

437
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:26,663
Who will ride with him?

438
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:29,065
Ain't nobody going back
to hell to chase that man.

439
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:32,769
We're kinda partial to having
our heads attached to our torso.

440
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:35,372
I will.

441
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:44,681
Pardon my crime, shit,
I'll ride with the nigger.

442
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:51,054
Well, you wouldn't be the first
outlaw put on a straight path

443
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:53,757
by being a posseman.

444
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:56,793
You are charged with
some serious crimes, sir.

445
00:39:56,795 --> 00:39:59,763
You would likely fall upon
the ground if put in prison

446
00:39:59,765 --> 00:40:01,965
being as old as you are.

447
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:05,769
Upon execution of this warrant
with Mr. Reeves here...

448
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:10,440
I will pardon you.

449
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,677
- What's his name?
- Charlie Storm.

450
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,579
Pleased to meet you.

451
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,948
All right,
you ain't so bad

452
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,917
for somebody that hung
all them sons of bitches.

453
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,787
Oh, I get it.

454
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:28,825
We got a Negro
and a senile old man

455
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:32,028
to bring in the most notorious
outlaw in this territory.

456
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,700

What you do...

480
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,092
when the whole world
doesn't believe in you?

481
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:15,965
You make believers out of
every last one of 'em.

482
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:27,176
Man: That rain's coming down.
Should we get some cover?

483
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:32,248
I think it'll pass.

484
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,924
Think it's smart
to leave town?

485
00:42:40,926 --> 00:42:43,092
I don't think anyone
will bother us again.

486
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:46,195
Thing about the government
is they don't like to lose.

487
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:49,666
Won't pick a fight
if the decks are stacked.

488
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:52,835
Around here, we own the decks.
They know that.

489
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:54,704
Let's ride.

490
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:19,796
I need to see
Judge Parker now, missy.

491
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:22,665
I have orders from his boss,
President Grant,

492
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:24,834
not to appoint
Bass Reeves U.S. Marshal

493
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:27,704
and to have him
arrested forthwith.

494
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:30,974
I'm sorry, Senator.

495
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:33,042
Judge Parker's not
in the office today.

496
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:35,178
Nor is Mr. Reeves.

497
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:40,183
- Where in the hell is he?
- I don't know, sir.

498
00:43:40,185 --> 00:43:43,386
But they both have a home.

499
00:43:43,388 --> 00:43:45,788
I'll be sure to pass
the message along.

500
00:43:47,192 --> 00:43:48,625
Have good day now.

501
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:02,805
Nellie,
would you send Bass out,

502
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:05,908
so we can allow him to answer
to the proper authority?

503
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:08,211
It ain't nothing
he needs to answer for.

504
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:14,884
Gentlemen,
Mr. Reeves is not here.

505
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:18,788
And it would behoove you
to lay those arms aside.

506
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:22,058
Should one of her innocent
children get harmed,

507
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,993
I dare not be the man

508
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:26,896
to stand between
that person and Bass Reeves.

509
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:29,666
Put your arms away, boys.

510
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:31,901
It'd be nice
if you did, too, ma'am.

511
00:44:31,903 --> 00:44:34,837
I have orders here
from President Grant,

512
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,407
delivered from Senator Smith,

513
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:39,676
that Mr. Reeves stand trial.

514
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:41,744
Should they succeed in their endeavor,

515
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:44,347
I'll take it up with
President Grant myself.

516
00:44:46,418 --> 00:44:49,152
- If not--
- No "if not."

517
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:51,387
Bass Reeves is coming home.

518
00:44:52,824 --> 00:44:55,458
Of course.
Sorry, ma'am.

519
00:45:09,274 --> 00:45:12,909
See all them men got
sent to their grave?

520
00:45:14,345 --> 00:45:17,146
Son of bitches no better
than the outlaws out here.

521
00:45:33,498 --> 00:45:36,132
You know,
I'm gonna just pull my horse up and turn around

522
00:45:36,134 --> 00:45:38,301
if I don't get some straight talk.

523
00:45:38,303 --> 00:45:43,072
All right, wait a minute,
how's a nigger get land?

524
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,441
You can't own land,
can you?

525
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:47,477
You got a pretty wife,
you know.

526
00:45:47,479 --> 00:45:49,479
How'd an ugly son of a bitch
like you get such a pretty wife?

527
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:51,781
Don't you speak of my wife.

528
00:45:51,783 --> 00:45:54,050
Oh, so he can talk.

529
00:45:54,052 --> 00:45:57,153
- I talk when I need it.
- Uh-huh.

530
00:45:57,155 --> 00:46:00,456
- And don't you speak of my wife.
- All right.

531
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:02,225
Don't you worry about it.

532
00:46:02,227 --> 00:46:04,327
I'm not gonna speak at all.

533
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:31,354
I don't know if you realize this,

534
00:46:31,356 --> 00:46:33,556
but you can't get him without me.

535
00:46:36,261 --> 00:46:39,162
I don't need you
or nobody out here.

536
00:47:09,294 --> 00:47:12,295
We've been riding for two days.
We haven't seen a soul.

537
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:25,041
You even have a plan,
or you just get up and go?

538
00:47:25,043 --> 00:47:27,109
No time to plan.

539
00:47:27,111 --> 00:47:29,478
Well, shit, there's
always time for planning.

540
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,616
Plans are the difference between
being a cow rustler and a spirit pusher

541
00:47:33,618 --> 00:47:36,586
and being wanted for killing somebody
and having to face that hanging judge of yours.

542
00:47:36,588 --> 00:47:39,088
What you trying to say?

543
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,923
You done killed somebody
and got away with it?

544
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:43,125
I'm just saying what I said.

545
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:45,494
Yo, shut up, Charlie.

546
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:48,431
You ain't nothing but bluster.

547
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:51,367
Probably can't even hit a lick.

548
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:54,503
Can't even hit a buffalo in a herd.

549
00:47:54,505 --> 00:47:56,472
- Shit.
- You know, I'm starting to think riding to Detroit

550
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:59,942
would've been easier on
my nerves than riding with you.

551
00:47:59,944 --> 00:48:02,879
You know, your pardon doesn't depend
on how many words you speak.

552
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:07,383
Oh, I know.
I just find joy in talking.

553
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:10,653
Besides, you should thank
that God you sing to

554
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:12,555
I can shoot
pretty good, too.

555
00:48:14,926 --> 00:48:16,259
Yeah, okay.

556
00:48:16,261 --> 00:48:18,194
Okay?

557
00:48:19,264 --> 00:48:20,363
Okay?

558
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:23,666
Yeah, okay.

559
00:48:23,668 --> 00:48:25,601
Point.

560
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:28,004
- We do not have time for this.
- No, no, no, no.

561
00:48:28,006 --> 00:48:30,072
You just called
my ability into question.

562
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:32,208
Let me put your mind at ease.

563
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,510
I'm either going to prove you
right or wrong. Now point.

564
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:42,652
That rock.

565
00:48:42,654 --> 00:48:45,254
Which one?

566
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:47,323
- All right, let me bring it closer.
- No, no, no.

567
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:50,126
You don't have to bring it closer.

568
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:52,328
The big rock in between the--

569
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:53,996
- In between the trees.
- I got you.

570
00:49:00,305 --> 00:49:02,104
That wasn't me.

571
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,077
Let's go.

572
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:15,137
Why'd you tear off
like that?

573
00:51:15,139 --> 00:51:17,506
They needed help,
I helped.

574
00:51:17,508 --> 00:51:20,576
You don't get it, do you?
Them people might've been dead.

575
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:23,479
You just go off without no plan.

576
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:25,381
Just tear off like that.

577
00:51:25,383 --> 00:51:27,349
Don't they teach you niggers
anything about patience?

578
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:29,318
You're such a coon.

579
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:40,429
That is the last time
you use that word around me.

580
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:42,665
That's why you swung on me?

581
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:46,302
I-- I don't mean nothing by it!

582
00:51:46,304 --> 00:51:48,704
That's what my pappy
taught me.

583
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:50,773
Horse, nig--

584
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:52,475
Okay, okay, okay.

585
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:57,179
It don't mean nothing
coming from me.

586
00:51:57,181 --> 00:51:58,814
- Well, it means something coming to me.
- Well, all right.

587
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:05,721
Shit.

588
00:52:07,325 --> 00:52:09,225
All I'm trying to say is...

589
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:16,132
- ...you're all coon and no crow.
- What?

590
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:18,501
Coon, coon. You know,
an animal-- coon.

591
00:52:18,503 --> 00:52:20,736
He come into your house,
he takes what he wants,

592
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:22,605
and he leaves, he's fearless.

593
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:25,474
Now, a crow.
A crow wants a nut,

594
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:28,244
he don't want to break his beak.
He'll drop that nut in the middle of the road,

595
00:52:28,246 --> 00:52:31,313
wait for a wagon to come by,
break it, pick it up,

596
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,249
take his bounty and leave.

597
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:34,817
It's called patience.

598
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:36,485
Now, you making no sense,
Charlie Storm.

599
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:37,920
I'm making a lot of sense.

600
00:52:37,922 --> 00:52:39,922
And you'll get it...

601
00:52:42,527 --> 00:52:44,160
as soon as you get it.

602
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:46,929
Gentlemen,
sorry to disturb your brotherly spat,

603
00:52:46,931 --> 00:52:49,198
but the sun'll be set
before you settle.

Sweet song.

00:53:16,827 --> 00:53:18,827
Why you getting shot at?

610
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:21,897
Well, we been moving
our people from the south

611
00:53:21,899 --> 00:53:24,767
to this fertile ground in Kansas.

612
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:27,803
Been doing that since '72.

613
00:53:27,805 --> 00:53:30,906
But the federal government
been moving their troops out the south.

614
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:33,342
So we had to find
a new route.

615
00:53:33,344 --> 00:53:35,678
You should come.

616
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,214
Just planted our first collard.

617
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:40,716
Been fetchin' for people.

618
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,851
Got about 600 right now.

619
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:44,687
I got land.

620
00:53:44,689 --> 00:53:47,523
- You own it?
- I homestead it.

621
00:53:47,525 --> 00:53:50,793
'66, when the law changed.

622
00:53:50,795 --> 00:53:52,761
Became a citizen.

623
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:56,932
Federal government approved me.

624
00:53:56,934 --> 00:54:00,002
Homestead.
You heard of taxes?

625
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:01,837
Landlords?

626
00:54:03,774 --> 00:54:07,343
I was an undertaker
back there in Nashville.

627
00:54:07,345 --> 00:54:09,678
And sometimes
I'd have to bury fathers.

628
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,015
Maybe by the next morning,

629
00:54:13,017 --> 00:54:15,918
that landlord would
go to that mother,

630
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,621
she'd have about
six or seven children.

631
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:21,290
And that landlord would tell her,

632
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:23,959
"Your husband owed me
before he died."

633
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:25,828
And then he'd say,

634
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:29,665
"You have to go some other
place, I cannot take care of you."

635
00:54:31,269 --> 00:54:33,869
Now, that's something
I would take notice of.

636
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:37,806
Sooner or later,
you find her coming out
some disorderly house.

637
00:54:37,808 --> 00:54:40,276
And those children?

638
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:42,745
State prison.

639
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:45,948
Sounds like tales of Exodus.

640
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:49,351
I thought old Abe set you free.

641
00:54:49,353 --> 00:54:51,720
Although the law
say we free,

642
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:55,791
the South still sends for us
with money on our heads.

643
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:58,794
They call that a Southern
bounty group.

644
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:01,330
Southern country
is out of joint, sir.

645
00:55:01,332 --> 00:55:03,866
And it's coming west.

646
00:55:03,868 --> 00:55:06,302
They running out
of land already.

647
00:55:06,304 --> 00:55:08,771
And when they come,

648
00:55:08,773 --> 00:55:11,707
they're bringing all
their ills with them.

649
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:14,443
I know,

650
00:55:14,445 --> 00:55:17,680
the blood of a white man
runs through my veins.

651
00:55:17,682 --> 00:55:21,417
There is some good white men
in the Southern country.

652
00:55:21,419 --> 00:55:25,087
But it ain't the majority,
to which you just might fit.

653
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:27,423
Yeah.

654
00:55:27,425 --> 00:55:29,358
Maybe I would.

655
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:35,964
Maybe you just don't know
what you want, but I do.

656
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:38,600
I want to shut my eyes

657
00:55:38,602 --> 00:55:40,703
without the sound
of white oppression

658
00:55:40,705 --> 00:55:42,738
coursing through my ears.

659
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:45,507
I got a mission, and I'm gonna
need to get rested for it.

660
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:50,979
We gotta finish some work
we started days ago.

661
00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:56,385
We'll take you
to the next town over.

662
00:55:56,387 --> 00:55:59,121
See that you get a wagon
and a horse.

663
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:03,759
You'll be all right
in Cherokee land.

664
00:56:50,808 --> 00:56:52,941
Fellas?

665
00:56:55,613 --> 00:56:57,045
Fellas.

666
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:59,047
Whoa.

667
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:02,484
I think you and the lady
might be lost.

668
00:57:04,155 --> 00:57:06,522
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

669
00:57:06,524 --> 00:57:08,190
You can't do that in my territory.

670
00:57:08,192 --> 00:57:11,193
Your territory?

671
00:57:11,195 --> 00:57:13,162
Man as handsome
and strong as yourself

672
00:57:13,164 --> 00:57:15,030
needn't worry about us.

673
00:57:15,032 --> 00:57:16,732
We're just wandering.

674
00:57:16,734 --> 00:57:19,067
- We don't want any trouble, either.
- Mm-mm.

675
00:57:19,069 --> 00:57:22,171
A couple of my men
were gunned down.

676
00:57:22,173 --> 00:57:23,972
We're looking
for who's responsible.

677
00:57:23,974 --> 00:57:27,609
- Well, that wouldn't be--
- Why do you care?

678
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:29,578
Why do I care?

679
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:33,015
I'm saying, are they kin to you?

680
00:57:33,017 --> 00:57:35,851
- They got to be kin for me to care?
- Maybe not.

681
00:57:35,853 --> 00:57:37,886
But to approach a stranger
seeking information,

682
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:41,056
I would judge you to be kin or crazy.

683
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:45,894
Well, I ain't kin.

684
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:48,730
Well, then you must be crazy.

685
00:57:53,604 --> 00:57:55,771
I didn't get your name.

686
00:57:55,773 --> 00:57:58,740
Well, I'm Frank James.

687
00:57:58,742 --> 00:58:00,609
This is my brother Jesse.

688
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:02,211
And this firecracker
right here,

689
00:58:02,213 --> 00:58:04,580
- well, that's Belle.
- Belle?

690
00:58:04,582 --> 00:58:07,916
Belle Starr,
of the Sam Starr Gang.

691
00:58:07,918 --> 00:58:12,688
So if that name means something,
I suggest you be on your way.

692
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:16,859
James, of the Younger Gang?

693
00:58:16,861 --> 00:58:20,095
Yeah, they call us that.

694
00:58:20,097 --> 00:58:22,764
Well, thanks for the information
on your compadre.

695
00:58:22,766 --> 00:58:26,134
I think we'll be going to find him
now and congratulate him.

696
00:58:26,136 --> 00:58:28,203
Okay.

697
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:30,005
What'd you put inside
of the hole?

698
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:32,741
Just our dog.

699
00:58:32,743 --> 00:58:34,977
That's a mighty big
hole for a dog.

700
00:58:34,979 --> 00:58:36,912
He was a mighty big dog.

701
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,753
Come on.

702
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:03,138
You kin to him?

703
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:06,708
- Do I look like him?
- Little bit.

704
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,311
Sure don't sound like him,
though. Where you from?

705
00:59:09,313 --> 00:59:11,213
Scotland.

706
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:13,081
Where's that?

707
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:16,585
Europe. Read about it.
Pinkerton's from there.

708
00:59:16,587 --> 00:59:19,922
Pinkerton? You mean that motherfucker--
can't catch Jesse James?

709
00:59:19,924 --> 00:59:21,657
Yeah.

710
00:59:24,795 --> 00:59:26,929
He's about as skillful as...

711
00:59:30,868 --> 00:59:33,001
What's going on up there?

712
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:45,213
We got to go.

713
00:59:54,992 --> 00:59:56,892
Having a plan would
come in real handy

714
00:59:56,894 --> 00:59:59,127
about now, wouldn't it?

715
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,033
Who are you?

716
01:00:05,035 --> 01:00:08,637
Bass Reeves.

717
01:00:10,841 --> 01:00:12,808
We don't want no trouble.

718
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:14,843
Maybe trouble seeks you.

719
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:16,979
Sheriff,
excuse my friend here.

720
01:00:16,981 --> 01:00:19,314
He-- He said he knew
this land here.

721
01:00:19,316 --> 01:00:21,750
If we knew this was your piece,
we could have avoided

722
01:00:21,752 --> 01:00:23,952
this whole unfortunate confrontation.

723
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:26,254
- Shut up, old man.
- Yes, sir.

724
01:00:26,256 --> 01:00:28,724
Man: You say your name
was Bass Reeves?

725
01:00:31,729 --> 01:00:33,895
Who asks?

726
01:00:33,897 --> 01:00:36,932
My goodness,
thought you was Dick Lassen's boys

727
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:38,967
riding behind us to get
their piece of vengeance.

728
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:41,036
Sam?

729
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:56,218
- Sam Sixkiller.
- Mm-hmm.

730
01:01:00,124 --> 01:01:03,225
This here is Sam Sixkiller.

731
01:01:03,227 --> 01:01:04,960
He took me in
when I left my men.

732
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,364
When I left the war.

733
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:16,004
Saved my life.

734
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:19,741
What kind of name
is Sam Sixkiller?

735
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,843
And this here
is Charlie Storm.

736
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:26,882
Your friends?

737
01:01:26,884 --> 01:01:28,350
Mm-hmm.

738
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:31,186
What are you doing
in these parts, Bass?

739
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:34,890
I thought you was too fancy
to visit these lands again, huh?

740
01:01:34,892 --> 01:01:36,892
I'm just heading
to Muskogee for now.

741
01:01:36,894 --> 01:01:39,828
Mm-hmm, me too.
Sun's setting,

742
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:41,730
why don't you come
rest up in town,

743
01:01:41,732 --> 01:01:43,365
get that looked after.

744
01:01:56,113 --> 01:01:57,913
Bass?

745
01:02:01,185 --> 01:02:04,252
You all have an open
invitation to join us.

746
01:02:05,856 --> 01:02:08,190
We would, but we can't.

747
01:02:08,192 --> 01:02:10,258
Bass has got a family back home

748
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,427
depending on us getting back
and finishing this mission.

749
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:15,797
Mm-hmm. I understand.

750
01:02:22,339 --> 01:02:25,340
You be careful, though.
Make you drowsy.

751
01:02:32,049 --> 01:02:34,216
You believe that?

752
01:02:34,218 --> 01:02:36,485
About what?

753
01:02:36,487 --> 01:02:38,520
The white man took his land.

754
01:02:38,522 --> 01:02:41,523
Well, you white.
You own land?

755
01:02:41,525 --> 01:02:45,761
Oh, I had land.
They took it too.

756
01:02:45,763 --> 01:02:48,330
They? They, who?

757
01:02:48,332 --> 01:02:51,133
Well, Confederates
took it first.

758
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:54,236
That brought the Union
soldiers to my doorstep.

759
01:02:54,238 --> 01:02:57,139
Then the Union took it, kept it.

760
01:02:57,141 --> 01:03:00,876
What about your wife, offspring?

761
01:03:04,982 --> 01:03:06,314
No.

762
01:03:21,565 --> 01:03:25,033
So, what's this mission?
You on the hunt?

763
01:03:25,035 --> 01:03:26,501
Yeah.

764
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:28,270
Who would that be?

765
01:03:28,272 --> 01:03:30,138
Bob Dozier.

766
01:03:34,178 --> 01:03:36,845
We should get a drink.

767
01:03:36,847 --> 01:03:38,914
- I don't--
- I'll drink for the both of us.

768
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:40,282
All right.

01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:29,297
Bass.

779
01:04:29,299 --> 01:04:32,167
You hear a single word of this?

780
01:04:32,169 --> 01:04:34,469
I apologize, man.

781
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:38,240
Thought I was gonna have to have
a word with Charlie over there.

782
01:04:38,242 --> 01:04:42,010
He's quite a character,
isn't he?

783
01:04:42,012 --> 01:04:46,548
You know that man you seek?
He's as bad as they come.

784
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:49,517
We come from the same place,

785
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:52,087
breathe the same air.

786
01:04:52,089 --> 01:04:55,056
If he's as bad
as you say he is,

787
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:57,425
what that make me?

788
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:01,296
Huh?!

789
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:07,135
Dick Lassen is as mean as
that man's pinkie toe.

790
01:05:07,137 --> 01:05:09,337
Now, I don't run from
a fight, you know that.

791
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:11,273
But I would not pursue him.

792
01:05:11,275 --> 01:05:13,475
I ain't ever met
a man that mean.

793
01:05:13,477 --> 01:05:15,310
Or that fast.

794
01:05:15,312 --> 01:05:17,145
Not even you, Bass.

795
01:05:17,147 --> 01:05:18,480
Well, you haven't
seen me for a while.

796
01:05:18,482 --> 01:05:20,482
No. No, I haven't.

797
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:25,954
Look, he sent a man's head

798
01:05:25,956 --> 01:05:30,091
with a badge attached
to his eye to a judge.

799
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:33,662
Don't you never mind,
'cause I don't know where he is.

800
01:05:33,664 --> 01:05:36,031
Not many do.

801
01:05:45,575 --> 01:05:47,676
Whoa.

802
01:05:49,046 --> 01:05:51,713
Whoa, easy guys.

803
01:05:51,715 --> 01:05:53,648
Easy.

804
01:05:56,954 --> 01:05:58,553
It's just me.

805
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:04,225
I have a message for Dozier.

806
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:16,071
Any creature
that would leave to die, the delegate,

807
01:06:16,073 --> 01:06:19,541
they warrant any punishment
that befalls them.

808
01:06:41,732 --> 01:06:45,200
Negro, speaks Creek...

809
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:51,206
shot five men before
they could draw.

810
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:55,076
Right,
and he's looking for me.

811
01:06:57,314 --> 01:07:00,415
Well, I guess my last message
wasn't loud enough.

812
01:07:02,052 --> 01:07:04,719
Government man wants
to find me, Negro or not...

813
01:07:06,656 --> 01:07:09,657
well, I'll make it easy for 'em.

They're gonna be just fine.

Bass.

Yeah.

839
01:08:45,822 --> 01:08:48,556
What is it, Sam?

840
01:08:52,662 --> 01:08:55,797
I just never thought of you
as a law man.

841
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:58,333
Not after what the law
did to you.

842
01:08:59,703 --> 01:09:02,137
The law put me in chains.

843
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:07,175
But the law also set me free.

844
01:09:07,177 --> 01:09:10,211
Now, I got six little ones,
and I need to stay free.

845
01:09:10,213 --> 01:09:11,679
Six?

846
01:09:11,681 --> 01:09:14,215
Gracious, Bass,

847
01:09:14,217 --> 01:09:16,818
you wearing that poor woman
out, ain't you?

848
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:31,833
I hear there's a black boy
seeking my whereabouts.

849
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:34,169
It's him.

850
01:09:42,445 --> 01:09:44,379
It's Dozier!

851
01:09:44,381 --> 01:09:46,247
No.

852
01:09:47,184 --> 01:09:48,850
Seek no more, here I am.

853
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:05,833
Bass?

854
01:10:07,737 --> 01:10:10,605
He rides into my town,
we'll take him together, Bass.

855
01:10:10,607 --> 01:10:14,609
No, he rides into your town
for me, it's me he gets.

856
01:10:14,611 --> 01:10:16,878
You can't face him alone.

857
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,648
Even if I can't,
you with your one arm,

858
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:22,750
it's not gonna be much help.

859
01:10:22,752 --> 01:10:24,652
I can shoot with one
better than most with two,

860
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:26,487
you know that, Bass.

861
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:29,290
Sixkiller,

862
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:32,493
you saved a drowning boy once.

863
01:10:32,495 --> 01:10:34,562
Let that man repay you.

864
01:10:35,966 --> 01:10:37,599
You got two minutes.

865
01:10:37,601 --> 01:10:39,334
I won't need 'em.

866
01:10:54,251 --> 01:10:56,017
Don't tell me
you went coward on me.

867
01:11:14,871 --> 01:11:18,339
Well, I'll be damned.

868
01:11:18,341 --> 01:11:20,808
That young Indian was right.

869
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:26,381
A Negro on a quest for me.

870
01:11:26,383 --> 01:11:28,049
Bob Dozier...

871
01:11:30,287 --> 01:11:33,955
I have a warrant for your arrest.

872
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,560
A Negro with that warrant
has no authority here.

873
01:11:39,562 --> 01:11:40,762
Oh, but he does.

874
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:44,799
And so do I.

875
01:11:50,874 --> 01:11:53,941
I'm gonna
excuse your ignorance,

876
01:11:53,943 --> 01:11:55,910
give you a chance
to claim your life.

877
01:11:58,014 --> 01:12:01,015
Thank you, Mr. Dozier.

878
01:12:01,017 --> 01:12:02,950
I will return.

879
01:12:07,524 --> 01:12:10,858
But not without executing
this warrant.

880
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:14,629
Dead... or alive.

881
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:22,370
Is that the way
you want it to be?

882
01:12:22,372 --> 01:12:24,439
That's the way it is.

883
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:44,826
Your move, boy.

884
01:13:37,514 --> 01:13:39,046
Dead or alive.

885
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:42,583
Got one, boy!

886
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:32,560
Bass hasn't
been seen in a week,

887
01:15:32,562 --> 01:15:34,562
and he's feared dead.

888
01:15:34,564 --> 01:15:37,732
President Grant will be here
in two days.

889
01:16:22,879 --> 01:16:24,845
Let's take him together, Bass.

890
01:16:26,716 --> 01:16:30,184

a drowning boy once.

Well, I'm up now.

896
01:17:14,731 --> 01:17:18,199
Spanish Fort,
about a half a day's ride.

897
01:17:22,672 --> 01:17:24,972
You thinking about going alone?

898
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:29,343
Well, you got one arm,

899
01:17:29,345 --> 01:17:31,012
you liquored,

900
01:17:31,014 --> 01:17:33,247

01:17:35,952 --> 01:17:37,885
All right.

902
01:17:39,422 --> 01:17:41,322
Go on, then...

903
01:17:44,027 --> 01:17:47,028
make a widow of your wife,
orphan of them kids.

904
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:52,166
Go on!

905
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:54,802
Bad-ass Bass Reeves.

906
01:17:54,804 --> 01:17:57,672
The man who rides
with nobody by his side.

907
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:02,343
Shit. Well, go on.

908
01:18:04,347 --> 01:18:08,949
He may be slow of tongue,
but his words are sharp.

909
01:18:11,454 --> 01:18:14,455
Now, Dozier
may have some men,

910
01:18:14,457 --> 01:18:16,023
but he don't need
them anymore--

911
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:17,992
Well, what good are you?!

912
01:18:19,362 --> 01:18:22,029
You got one arm.

913
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:24,365
You can't even go a day
without drinking.

914
01:18:26,469 --> 01:18:28,869
The border's right there.

915
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:30,871
Why don't you run?

916
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:33,340
You don't have to finish.

917
01:18:40,116 --> 01:18:45,019
Buddy, I seen what you did
to Dozier's men.

918
01:18:45,021 --> 01:18:48,222
If you only had some help.

919
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:51,759
I mean, what I'm trying
to say is,

920
01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:53,327
if you insist on going

921
01:18:53,329 --> 01:18:55,763
after what you now know...

922
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,500
then fuck it!

923
01:18:59,502 --> 01:19:01,469
I'll go too.

924
01:19:01,471 --> 01:19:04,772
But we better pray
my boots become unstuck.

925
01:19:04,774 --> 01:19:08,075
Yeah, I could run.
I could be headed for the border.

926
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:10,311
Keep taking what I want,

927
01:19:10,313 --> 01:19:13,948
shoot anybody who doesn't
want to give it to me.

928
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:17,084
Or maybe
I could do something.

929
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:19,920
You know, something...

930
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:23,090
Worthy...
of a proper obit.

931
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:24,091
Huh?

932
01:19:26,195 --> 01:19:27,995
Something worth writing about.

933
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:35,302
Why don't you go home?
You're the one with the family.

934
01:19:36,773 --> 01:19:40,040
Leave this fool's errand
to this coward here.

935
01:19:40,042 --> 01:19:43,210
And this old drunk outlaw.

936
01:19:51,888 --> 01:19:55,189
If I leave...

937
01:19:55,191 --> 01:19:58,092
Who's gonna save ya
from the fool's folly?

938
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:01,829
Thatta boy!

939
01:20:05,101 --> 01:20:06,901
Thatta boy.

940
01:20:15,011 --> 01:20:16,811
Yow!

941
01:21:01,224 --> 01:21:03,390
"I'll annointest my hand with oil.

942

01:21:06,062 --> 01:21:08,863
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me

944
01:21:08,865 --> 01:21:11,198
all the days of my life."

945
01:21:59,215 --> 01:22:02,283
40 men on three.

946
01:22:02,285 --> 01:22:05,352
That's not odds I'd take
if I was a gambler.

947
01:22:05,354 --> 01:22:08,355
Yeah, you win at them odds,
you a legend.

948
01:22:08,357 --> 01:22:12,293
All right,
we wait till nightfall,

949
01:22:12,295 --> 01:22:14,628
circle the town,

950
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:17,564
then we jump them
before daybreak.

951
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:20,634
That's it?
That's what you want to do?

952
01:22:20,636 --> 01:22:22,970
That's why we came.

953
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:27,675
We circled this before,
and there were six of us,

954
01:22:27,677 --> 01:22:29,310
or five.

955
01:22:29,312 --> 01:22:31,645
And he was alone.

956
01:22:31,647 --> 01:22:33,948
And he still lives.

957
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:35,950
Did you go in by surprise?

958
01:22:35,952 --> 01:22:37,718
No, the stupid bastard

959
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:40,955
Well, you don't knock
on the Devil's door and ask to come in.

960
01:22:40,957 --> 01:22:44,291
You wait till nightfall.

961
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:47,494
You go in real quiet-like,
you take out every man that's posted.

962
01:22:47,496 --> 01:22:50,064
You make your way
through the house,

963
01:22:50,066 --> 01:22:53,334
you get to his bedroom,
you surround the motherfucker,

964
01:22:53,336 --> 01:22:56,070
he comes out with you.

965
01:22:56,072 --> 01:22:58,072
Dead or alive.

966
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:02,309

970
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:38,178
Then the boss rides up,
lights some dynamite,

971
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,080
tosses it in the house,

972
01:23:40,082 --> 01:23:42,116
we ride off, and then boom!

973
01:23:42,118 --> 01:23:44,218
Whole ground shook.

974
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:46,120
Is that it?

975
01:24:18,487 --> 01:24:20,754

No, I'm good.

I'm gonna go sleep off this fun.

978
01:24:28,531 --> 01:24:31,765

997
01:25:44,807 --> 01:25:46,640
I'm just passing through.

998
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:49,243
You the law?

999
01:25:49,245 --> 01:25:52,212
I don't know of any colored
lawmen around these parts.

1000
01:25:52,214 --> 01:25:54,615
Come on.

1001
01:25:54,617 --> 01:25:57,651
Oh! Easy...

1002
01:25:57,653 --> 01:26:00,821
If you've come for Dozier,
we ain't got no quarrel.

1003
01:26:00,823 --> 01:26:03,590
I do what I do out here
just not to die.

1004
01:26:03,592 --> 01:26:05,559
Where does Dozier
keep his horse?

1005
01:26:05,561 --> 01:26:07,861
Outside his house.

1006
01:26:07,863 --> 01:26:09,763
Especially since that
marshal showed up,

1007
01:26:09,765 --> 01:26:11,532
woods are dangerous over there.

1008
01:26:19,408 --> 01:26:21,341
You're a lucky man.

1009
01:27:46,929 --> 01:27:49,429
Lord,
tell me if I should act now.

1010
01:27:56,739 --> 01:27:59,406
I'm sorry, Lord.

1011
01:27:59,408 --> 01:28:01,775
I was kind of hoping
you'd be louder.

1012
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:07,047
But you didn't say no.

1013
01:28:48,524 --> 01:28:51,558
You killed a dear
friend of mine.

1014
01:28:53,028 --> 01:28:55,028
You tried to kill me too.

1015
01:28:56,765 --> 01:28:58,398
You didn't die.

1016
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:01,068
Like I said before,

1017
01:29:01,070 --> 01:29:04,638
I'm here to return you to Fort Smith.

1018
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:08,675
By the power given me
by the Federal Court.

1019
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:10,877
You can cackle all you want.

1020
01:29:13,048 --> 01:29:15,882
You and no Federal Court
has any jurisdiction over me.

1021
01:29:15,884 --> 01:29:18,652
Then maybe I'll just
shoot you dead now.

1022
01:29:21,423 --> 01:29:23,390
Just pull this trigger.

1023
01:29:23,392 --> 01:29:25,125
You won't.

1024
01:29:25,127 --> 01:29:27,394
'Cause you ain't me.

1025
01:29:29,832 --> 01:29:32,466
You don't like to shoot first
or you would have done so

1026
01:29:32,468 --> 01:29:34,101
when my men surrounded you, no?

1027
01:29:34,103 --> 01:29:36,670
But me?

1028
01:29:36,672 --> 01:29:38,505
I'd shoot you dead.

1029
01:29:40,376 --> 01:29:42,743
You better be a good shot.

1030
01:29:45,681 --> 01:29:47,547
I'm better than good.

1031
01:29:49,518 --> 01:29:51,785
Did you know I used to be
a deputy marshal?

1032
01:29:51,787 --> 01:29:54,488
- That doesn't matter.
- It matters.

1033
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:58,792
But your government
accused me a robbery.

1034
01:29:58,794 --> 01:30:00,794
Stripped me of my star.

1035
01:30:02,598 --> 01:30:04,698
And lashed me to confess,

1036
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:05,966
locked me up.

1037
01:30:05,968 --> 01:30:08,502
I lost my family.

1038
01:30:08,504 --> 01:30:10,504
Yellow fever.

1039
01:30:10,506 --> 01:30:12,472
Couldn't do nothing.

1040
01:30:15,144 --> 01:30:18,812
My Annie was the purest
thing I'd ever seen.

1041
01:30:18,814 --> 01:30:21,948
So was my Corina,
but they met the dirt.

1042
01:30:23,685 --> 01:30:25,552
Like an outlaw.

1043
01:30:25,554 --> 01:30:29,523
Because law wasn't reasonable,

1044
01:30:29,525 --> 01:30:32,426
and my wife and my baby died.

1045
01:30:32,428 --> 01:30:35,529
It was made very clear to me
that I was to pursue my earnest desires.

1046
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:39,800
Because living is to live...

1047
01:30:39,802 --> 01:30:41,701
and then you die.

1048
01:30:45,541 --> 01:30:47,808
That may well be.

1049
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:52,846
Jim Bruce, Sam Sixkiller,
Belle Starr's brother no longer living, and you are.

1050
01:30:52,848 --> 01:30:57,017
But you gonna do your living
and dying in Detroit prison.

1051
01:31:25,647 --> 01:31:28,882
Oh, you ain't leaving here
tonight, colored boy!

1052
01:31:28,884 --> 01:31:31,084
You should have thought
this through.

1053
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:03,517
Ah!

1054
01:32:20,202 --> 01:32:22,135
Get him!

1055
01:32:38,954 --> 01:32:40,754
Charlie!

1056
01:33:57,733 --> 01:33:59,366
Giddup!

1057
01:34:02,804 --> 01:34:04,704
Go get that son of a bitch!

1058
01:34:42,778 --> 01:34:45,378
Now, it's too dangerous
for you.

1059
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:47,814
I'm gonna be back.

1060
01:34:49,117 --> 01:34:51,217
But if I don't,

1061
01:34:51,219 --> 01:34:53,953
you make sure you take Nellie
and my little ones where they need to be.

1062
01:37:38,587 --> 01:37:40,520
Cheer up.

1063
01:38:34,242 --> 01:38:37,110
I gotta give it to you!

1064
01:38:37,112 --> 01:38:40,346
Only one moving!

1065
01:38:40,348 --> 01:38:43,349
You and me would've made a hell
of a team in another life,

1066
01:38:43,351 --> 01:38:45,218
nigger and all.

1067
01:38:48,223 --> 01:38:50,957
Why don't you come out now
and have a fair fight?

1068
01:40:10,572 --> 01:40:13,239
I told you, lawman,

1069
01:40:13,241 --> 01:40:15,441
government doesn't have
any jurisdiction over me.

1070
01:40:47,742 --> 01:40:50,510
Dead or alive.

1071
01:41:33,788 --> 01:41:35,421
Thank you.

1072
01:41:35,423 --> 01:41:38,424
Well, old man,
you got the spirit to ride

1073
01:41:38,426 --> 01:41:40,560
or should I just
retire you here?

1074
01:41:40,562 --> 01:41:42,628
You wish.

1075
01:41:42,630 --> 01:41:45,731
- Tom, you coming?
- No.

1076
01:41:45,733 --> 01:41:48,734
I think Spanish Fort

1077
01:41:48,736 --> 01:41:51,170
is a place that needs
some looking after.

1078
01:41:51,172 --> 01:41:55,141
Well,
if anybody ever says

1079
01:41:55,143 --> 01:41:57,710
Tom Pinkerton's a coward,

1080
01:41:57,712 --> 01:42:00,880
- you just send them my way.
- Thanks.

1081
01:42:02,650 --> 01:42:04,484
Come on, Jake.

1082
01:42:10,558 --> 01:42:11,858
Hey, Charlie!

1083
01:42:14,162 --> 01:42:17,597
I got my boots unstuck!

1084
01:42:19,467 --> 01:42:21,467
You crazy.

1085
01:42:24,272 --> 01:42:27,206
You gentlemen are making a mistake.

1086
01:42:27,208 --> 01:42:31,244
No, Your Honor,
you made the mistake.

1087
01:42:33,748 --> 01:42:36,449
Good people of Fort Smith?

1088
01:42:36,451 --> 01:42:38,851
Gather the paper writers!

1089
01:42:38,853 --> 01:42:42,321
Charlie Storm and Bass Reeves

1090
01:42:42,323 --> 01:42:45,158
have returned with the bounty!

1091
01:42:46,861 --> 01:42:49,395
Y'all ain't gonna believe this.

1092
01:42:49,397 --> 01:42:51,564
None of you said
we could do it, did you?

1093
01:42:51,566 --> 01:42:54,734
We done brought back an outlaw

1094
01:42:54,736 --> 01:42:57,637
that has killed many lawmen,

1095
01:42:57,639 --> 01:43:01,307
innocent people, and others.

1096
01:43:01,309 --> 01:43:04,243
We done brought back
Bob Dozier!

1097
01:43:10,251 --> 01:43:13,252
Nellie, Bass is back!

1098
01:43:13,254 --> 01:43:15,655
They killed Dozier!

1099
01:43:56,998 --> 01:43:59,398
I thought you was dead.

1100
01:44:09,310 --> 01:44:11,844
I've been thinking about my obit.

1101
01:44:11,846 --> 01:44:14,547
Oh, not this again.

1102
01:44:14,549 --> 01:44:16,449
You are no longer an outlaw.

1103
01:44:16,451 --> 01:44:19,285
That's my point.

1104
01:44:19,287 --> 01:44:21,787
What's a good obit for a lawman?

1105
01:44:21,789 --> 01:44:23,856
Bass Reeves!

1106
01:44:25,793 --> 01:44:28,427
For some reason...

1107
01:44:29,631 --> 01:44:31,664
I think you gonna
have plenty of time.

1108
01:44:31,666 --> 01:44:33,666
Well, you know.
you can't be too careful.

1109
01:44:33,668 --> 01:44:35,668
Gentlemen.

1110
01:44:52,587 --> 01:44:56,689
Mr. Reeves,
you may enter the bar.

1111
01:44:58,293 --> 01:45:00,426
Here and in any court I preside in

1112
01:45:00,428 --> 01:45:02,662
as long as there's breath in my body.

1113
01:45:03,931 --> 01:45:07,033
Please, sir,
come forward.

1114
01:45:26,788 --> 01:45:28,921
You have something
for us, Judge?

1115
01:45:28,923 --> 01:45:31,490
I have a stack of
warrants for you.

1116
01:45:31,492 --> 01:45:34,093
- No less than 3,000.
- Ma'am.

1117
01:45:37,432 --> 01:45:40,766
Oh, and, Mr. Reeves,
I think you'll need this.

1118
01:46:19,741 --> 01:46:22,575
Will you gentlemen be
