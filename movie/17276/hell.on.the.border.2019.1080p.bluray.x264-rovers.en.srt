1
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,504
For a second there,

2
00:03:42,604 --> 00:03:45,707
I thought I finally done
enough to see Glory.

3
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:50,579
But my senses is telling me
you ain't no angels.

4
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,879
Well, you add a few wrinkles,
take away a little hair,

5
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:54,884
why, it looks like
we got Charlie Storm.

6
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,451
Cow rustler, spirit pusher.

7
00:03:56,551 --> 00:04:00,622
Mr. Lawman, I'm not exactly
well here right now.

8
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:02,859
Give me a little assistance
getting out of this mire

9
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,361
and I'll turn myself in
nice and peaceful like.

10
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:08,730
Well, why don't you just
get down and walk out?

11
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,633
I'll arrange someone
to get your mare.

12
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:14,270
Damn, if I could walk
out of here on my own strength,

13
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,730
you'd be having this conversation
with only my horse here,

14
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:17,639
not me.

15
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,625
What do you surmise, Bass?

16
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:23,680
One of us will have to
bring him out of that pit.

17
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:24,781
Well, you heard the man.

18
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,981
If he could walk in that,

19
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:27,983
he'd be somewhere dancing
with the savages.

20
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:31,036
Besides, I ain't dressed
for this occasion.

21
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,591
See here,

22
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,362
what I was trying to say is...

23
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:41,531
I'd walk through,

24
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,334
carry him across my shoulders
back to you for the iron.

25
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:46,702
So, you're gonna walk
seven paces out there,

26
00:04:46,802 --> 00:04:48,904
in mud that a horse
can't walk in?

27
00:04:49,004 --> 00:04:50,706
Yes, sir.

28
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:52,908
Well, if you say it,
I wanna see it.

29
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:55,848
Marshal, you gonna let that nigger
kill himself and me in the process?

30
00:04:55,644 --> 00:04:57,480
You need to watch
your mouth, old man.

31
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:59,449
And Mr. Reeves here,
he may be a Negro,

32
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:00,850
but he's my posseman.

33
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:02,918
And he may be the one
just saves your neck.

34
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:05,021
- I ain't going.
- Oh, you going.

35
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,790
- Oh, I ain't going.
- If'n he makes it out there to you,

36
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:09,529
you very well gonna
get on his shoulders

37
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:10,851
and make your way
back over here.

38
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:14,329
No, I won't.
I'm good right here.

39
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,731
Above ground
and breathing.

40
00:05:15,831 --> 00:05:17,600
That little nigger,
he's gonna sink,

41
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,601
and he gonna sink
with me in it.

42
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:22,605
Quite frankly, I don't really
care if you survive or not.

43
00:05:22,704 --> 00:05:25,007
Right here it says
"dead or alive."

44
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:27,009
And, Mr. Reeves,

45
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,810
why don't you try and not sink

46
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,947
before you get within
arm's shot of this bank here.

47
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:35,334
I don't suspect mud
is going to remove
from my linens very well.

48
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,355
Marshal,

49
00:05:39,454 --> 00:05:41,456
you better fix my obit right.

50
00:05:41,557 --> 00:05:44,661
"The outlaw Charlie Storm,

51
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:48,331
the most wanted outlaw
in the Indian Territory,

52
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:53,351
took a fight on with eight
U.S. Marshals and sixteen possemen."

53
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,735
You sure you can get me
out of this thing?

54
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,831
Well, I'll be.

55
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,528
Now, Charlie Storm.
Charlie Storm.

56
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:27,629
Yep.

57
00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:31,149
By the power vested in me...

58
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:35,872
from the federal judge
Isaac Parker,

59
00:07:35,971 --> 00:07:37,689
I place you under arrest.

60
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,127
Let's go, Bass.

61
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,850
What is it now?

62
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:51,920
Think I'ma help that mare.

63
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:54,122
Help it do what?

64
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,622
Help it out.

65
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,175
You know we can't
wait on you.

66
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,612
Let's go, Charlie.

67
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,725
The outlaws here are unruly.

68
00:08:30,826 --> 00:08:33,105
The only solution
to that unruliness is the rule of law.

69
00:08:32,227 --> 00:08:34,778
The law that you were
brought here to dispense.

70
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,188
Judge Isaac C. Parker...

71
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:49,644
is there a man out of
the ones that you sentenced

72
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:53,030
that didn't make a victim out
of an innocent man or woman?

73
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:58,587
No, you can bring
me the final pardon request

74
00:08:58,687 --> 00:09:01,206
for the man that
killed his friend.

75
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:23,178
Shouldn't I have
a counselor with me?

76
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:27,616
I do not care to speak with you
about your legal status.

77
00:09:27,716 --> 00:09:29,951
The purpose of my inquiry today

78
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:33,022
is to endeavor to speak with you
about softening your heart

79
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:37,192
in preparation for your
inevitable meeting with God.

80
00:09:37,293 --> 00:09:40,096
You shot your best friend
in the back.

81
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:42,798
And it will not be long
before you leave this world

82
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:45,067
and enter into eternity.

83
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,570
Now, I cannot
have mercy on you,

84
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:50,572
but there is one who can
pardon your offenses.

85
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,909
There is a savior whose blood
is sufficient enough

86
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:56,745
to wash this stain
from your soul.

87
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,115
Now, I beg of you to seek
the salvation of His holy cross.

88
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:03,251
Because I cannot, and I
shall not pardon your crimes.

89
00:10:03,351 --> 00:10:06,037
May God have mercy on you.

90
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,312
I didn't realize at the fort there would
be
so much unruly activity.

91
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:20,937
Well, you know today is the day
that Judge Parker is gonna send

92
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,605
six souls to meet
their maker.

93
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,207
Six? At one time?

94
00:10:26,307 --> 00:10:29,010
Judge Parker relishes on efficiency.

95
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,846
What kind of man hangs six men
in the name of efficiency?

96
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:34,198
Sounds more like
an outlaw than the law.

97
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,219
The law he is.

98
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:39,654
He passed the bar exam
when he was 21.

99
00:10:39,754 --> 00:10:41,591
He was a city attorney at 23.

100
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:43,650
He left the Democrats
'cause he opposed slavery.

101
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:44,692
Yeah.

102
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,763
All that speak he speaks.

103
00:10:47,863 --> 00:10:51,383
Only thing I can remember
is he hung six souls.

104
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,945
- Morning, Judge.
- Morning.

105
00:11:03,044 --> 00:11:06,096
It's Charlie Storm here.
He's ready for his arraignment.

106
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,969
Marshal, your prisoner
is covered in mud,

107
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:29,938
yet you remain pristine.

108
00:11:30,038 --> 00:11:32,399
Well, you know a good marshal
know how to bring his man in

109
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:35,110
without sacrificing his stature.

110
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:37,413
- You understand.
- Very well.

111
00:11:37,513 --> 00:11:40,716
Bring him to the jailer's.
I'll arraign him tomorrow.

112
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:42,900
Before noon, around 11:00.

113
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,823
Y'all leave me the fuck alone.

114
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:29,298
You know the colored man
Bass Reeves?

115
00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:32,201
Eh, no,
I can't say I do.

116
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:34,703
He broke away from
his master during the war.

117
00:12:34,803 --> 00:12:37,124
Learned the land, their native
tongue before coming here,

118
00:12:37,038 --> 00:12:41,744
and, well, Mr. Reeves has been
a posseman for a few years now.

119
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,361
I reckon it's time
for a promotion.

120
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:51,086
You want me to promote
a Negro to deputy marshal?

121
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,088
Yes, I do.

122
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:55,457
Why do you incessantly push me

123
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:57,359
to do things that are sure
to get me fired?

124
00:12:57,459 --> 00:12:59,729
I'm doing
no such a thing.

125
00:12:59,828 --> 00:13:02,831
I'm your assistant,
and I'm assisting you.

126
00:13:02,932 --> 00:13:06,101
You'd do well just to listen.

127
00:13:06,201 --> 00:13:08,037
You know as well as I do,

128
00:13:08,136 --> 00:13:11,340
this country, as progressive
as it pretends to be,

129
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,408
is not ready
for a colored marshal.

130
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:16,293
These people, they can
only handle so much change.

131
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:23,519
Bass and my Archie
homesteaded land together.

132
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:25,754
He'd have told ya,

133
00:13:25,855 --> 00:13:28,890
you won't find a man
more capable with a pistol.

134
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,143
I'll tell ya you won't find
a man more loyal to the law.

135
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,581
That's the kind
of deputy you need.

136
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,770
Evening, Bass.

137
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,471
Evening, Jessie.

138
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,542
You know Judge Parker?

139
00:13:46,642 --> 00:13:48,293
Yes, ma'am.

140
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,913
Evening, sir.

141
00:13:52,014 --> 00:13:53,614
Evening.

142
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,370
I'll be seeing you.

143
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,147
You're one of our possemen,
are you not?

144
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,418
Yes, sir.

145
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:16,971
How did you and that horse
find the occasion

146
00:14:17,072 --> 00:14:19,174
to be so stained
by mud?

147
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:22,577
You'd have to ask
Marshal Franks, sir.

148
00:14:22,677 --> 00:14:24,580
As a federal judge,

149
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,948
I'm inquiring of you now, sir.

150
00:14:27,048 --> 00:14:29,150
And, frankly,
I expect nothing less

151
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,068
than a straight
answer here.

152
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:38,159
With all respect due you,

153
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:40,596
Marshal Franks
is the man I ride for.

154
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:45,567
I will give you $20 federal salary

155
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:48,052
if you speak
plainly to me, sir.

156
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,841
Judge, there is not
a dollar amount

157
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:55,125
that will cause me
to betray my employer.

158
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,380
Oh, come on. I employ him.

159
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,616
He employs you.

160
00:15:01,716 --> 00:15:04,220
So, technically, I employ you.

161
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,621
What does he pay you anyway?

162
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:08,957
What, $3 a week?

163
00:15:09,057 --> 00:15:12,576
I'm offering you 20
to tell me about a horse.

164
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:20,018
I guess I just don't
see it that way, sir.

165
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:25,123
Miss Jessie.

166
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,447
You care to hear
something humorous?

167
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:33,349
I was with Franks today,

168
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:35,584
and he was spit-shine clean.

169
00:15:35,683 --> 00:15:40,322
But his prisoner was covered
about like you and that horse.

170
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:42,892
When I mentioned
that fact to him,

171
00:15:42,991 --> 00:15:45,527
he failed to even acknowledge you.

172
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:47,577
Or your name.

173
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:58,573
Good Lord, in Jesus's name,

174
00:15:58,673 --> 00:16:01,125
let me know that I'm doing
the right thing out here.

175
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:14,673
Wait.

176
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,563
I firmly believe that
it's been
appointed to men to live and die but
once.

177
00:16:22,663 --> 00:16:25,433
Yet before me stands the soul

178
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:28,169
that I know has departed
from this place.

179
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:30,288
You killed my brother.

180
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,993
No, wait.
I did no such thing.

181
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:40,515
Now, your brother,
he did what he did.

182
00:16:40,615 --> 00:16:43,284
He got justice.

183
00:16:43,384 --> 00:16:45,536
Don't do this.

184
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,217
Oh, please, God...

185
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:11,413
Came back to apologize
for being rude.

186
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:13,631
Are you Creek?

187
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,392
I'm not a boy.

188
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:25,175
I'm Rufus Buck.

189
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,446
Rufus Buck.

190
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,624
Lord above.

191
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:50,679
Jessie was right about you.

192
00:18:50,778 --> 00:18:54,182
She didn't
exaggerate at all.

193
00:18:54,282 --> 00:18:56,585
I've never seen a man
utilize his armaments

194
00:18:56,684 --> 00:18:59,621
with such speed and efficiency.

195
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,539
I mean, you had that boy dead
to rights and you just let him go.

196
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,278
Thank you.

197
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,651
What's wrong, sir?

198
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,522
Sir, I'm not a lawman.

199
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,826
And some of those folks was white.

200
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,931
You were witness.

201
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,352
Well, they drew first.

202
00:19:30,451 --> 00:19:33,251
On you and me.

203
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:35,723
You're damn right
I'm a witness.

204
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:37,624
So be it.

205
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,413
If you the witness,
who gonna be the judge?

206
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,857
Well, there may be a solution.

207
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:13,404
Bass...

208
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,674
Bass?

209
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,480
What's wrong?

210
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,037
I think I'm...

211
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:37,454
I might be a deputy marshal.

212
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,429
You what?

213
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,500
Bass...

214
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:54,690
You put a star on your chest,
you the target.

215
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:57,625
I've always been the target.
It's no difference.

216
00:22:57,726 --> 00:22:59,760
You trying to make
a widow of me?

217
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:02,941
- I'll just leave right now and save you
the trouble.
- No, I'm not trying--

218
00:23:01,896 --> 00:23:03,999
Let go of me,
Bass George Reeves.

219
00:23:04,098 --> 00:23:05,982
Let me alone.

220
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,904
We doing just fine
with you on the farm

221
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:12,374
and walking with the marshal
on occasion.

222
00:23:12,473 --> 00:23:15,410
Why now, Bass? Why?

223
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:16,509
Why?

224
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:22,633
'Cause we got six souls
sleeping in the next room.

225
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:36,057
All right, you three go around
back and we'll flank the front.

226
00:24:36,156 --> 00:24:37,156
Wait.

227
00:24:38,192 --> 00:24:41,529
Look, Jim, I know
we done come all this way,

228
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:46,067
but I think it's wise for us
to call somebody to assist us.

229
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,737
Since when did you
go yellowbelly?

230
00:24:48,836 --> 00:24:50,905
I ain't no yellowbelly,
my friend.

231
00:24:51,006 --> 00:24:54,476
but you've heard the same
stories that I've heard about Dozier.

232
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:58,980
Six of us here, that ain't
enough to bring him in.

233
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,714
You see this?

234
00:25:00,815 --> 00:25:02,784
You see those words?

235
00:25:02,884 --> 00:25:04,986
That says
"United States Deputy Marshal."

236
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,189
I am the United States.

237
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:09,156
And we, as the United States,

238
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,257
are gonna go in there
and we're gonna take Dozier

239
00:25:11,326 --> 00:25:13,528
back to Judge Parker
to answer for his crimes.

240
00:25:13,627 --> 00:25:16,631
And if any of you
are yellow like Tom,

241
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,530
you can just go somewhere
and bury your face

242
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,584
'cause your country
doesn't need you.

243
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,055
You see it like you want,
but I'm going home.

244
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:29,778
Judge is gonna have
your head for this.

245
00:25:29,877 --> 00:25:33,663
Maybe, but he might have yours
for not listening to reason.

246
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,839
You two go around back.

247
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,596
Just the five of us?

248
00:25:47,695 --> 00:25:50,580
- It's one man, Ned.
- I know.

249
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,420
Bob Dozier!

250
00:25:57,338 --> 00:26:00,709
United States
Deputy Marshal Jim Bruce!

251
00:26:00,808 --> 00:26:03,111
I have a warrant for your arrest

252
00:26:03,211 --> 00:26:06,615
out of the District Court
Fort Smith, Arkansas.

253
00:26:06,714 --> 00:26:10,218
Your house is surrounded.

254
00:26:10,317 --> 00:26:12,721
Turn yourself in now,

255
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,806
won't be unnecessary
spilling of your blood.

256
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,929
Bob Dozier.

257
00:26:21,028 --> 00:26:25,000
- United States Deputy--
- Dozier: I heard you cackle!

258
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:27,579
Repeating yourself is not gonna
endo you anymore jurisdiction

259
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,604
over me or my person
than it did the first time.

260
00:26:29,703 --> 00:26:31,806
You might not have heard,

261
00:26:31,905 --> 00:26:35,309
but the United States
has jurisdiction
over the Indian Territory.

262
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,578
And this is the Indian Territory.

263
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,647
- That right?
- Yeah.

264
00:26:39,748 --> 00:26:42,550
How's your government get jurisdiction
over land it don't own?

265
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:46,153
- Pardon?
- This land belongs to the Indian.

266
00:26:46,253 --> 00:26:47,854
Savages.

267
00:26:48,355 --> 00:26:50,791
Seems to me the Indians should
be giving you jurisdiction.

268
00:26:50,892 --> 00:26:52,932
Seeing as you stole
every piece of land from them,

269
00:26:52,926 --> 00:26:54,287
you forced them on this territory,

270
00:26:53,994 --> 00:26:55,596
I don't see them doing so.

271
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,031
Sir, you must be mistaken.

272
00:26:57,132 --> 00:27:00,101
The government
doesn't ask for permission.

273
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,002
We are the United States,

274
00:27:02,103 --> 00:27:03,771
and we are advising you
to come on out,

275
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,855
or we're coming in
there after you.

276
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,300
I dare you.

277
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,242
Well, go get him.

278
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:48,865
Is anyone left?

279
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:52,002
Oh, yes,

280
00:27:53,253 --> 00:27:56,958
United States
Deputy Marshal Jim Bruce,

281
00:27:57,057 --> 00:27:58,776
someone is left.

282
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:09,069
I told you you do not have
jurisdiction over me or my person.

283
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:12,406
Yet you still choose to
awaken me from my slumber.

284
00:28:12,507 --> 00:28:14,825
Cause a ruckus
in my town.

285
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:23,284
Tell me something,
Deputy Marshal Jim Bruce,

286
00:28:23,384 --> 00:28:26,135
what do you do when a rodent
invades your home?

287
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,980
That question was not
designed to be rhetorical.

288
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,702
- You kill it?
- Yes!

289
00:28:41,802 --> 00:28:44,005
You just don't kill it.

290
00:28:44,105 --> 00:28:46,305
You kill it and you send it
back to where it came from

291
00:28:46,273 --> 00:28:48,742
so that all the other rodents
see what happens

292
00:28:48,843 --> 00:28:51,127
they get the same idea.

293
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:02,390
Gather the coins that
he and the others carry.

294
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,093
Put 'em with the gains
from last night's coach.

295
00:29:05,192 --> 00:29:07,895
We'll give it to
the families that need it.

296
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,780
Keep the rest
so we may eat.

297
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,805
I apologize to
the women and children

298
00:29:16,904 --> 00:29:18,756
who had to witness
that defense of self.

299
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,327
Bring him to the vault.

300
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,364
Bring me my knife.

301
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:36,458
You, government man,

302
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:39,894
are gonna deliver
a message for me.

303
00:29:39,993 --> 00:29:43,765
It needs to be unmistakable.
Look at me.

304
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,282
Can you do that?

305
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,009
Senator Smith.

306
00:29:55,108 --> 00:29:59,079
Word reached that you might be
slumbering in these parts.

307
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,415
And I heard
there are several souls

308
00:30:01,516 --> 00:30:05,053
that slumber in these parts
at the hand of a black man.

309
00:30:05,153 --> 00:30:08,890
One of those gentlemen
was white.

310
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:14,295
Now, you know that even here,
as progressive as we may be,

311
00:30:14,394 --> 00:30:16,998
a Negro cannot shoot
a white man

312
00:30:17,097 --> 00:30:18,932
without the protection
of a shield.

313
00:30:19,032 --> 00:30:22,971
Is that what we call a white man
that ambushes a judge,

314
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,272
- a gentleman?
- You miss my meaning.

315
00:30:25,373 --> 00:30:27,407
No, never mind, because I intend

316
00:30:27,508 --> 00:30:30,044
to name that man deputy marshal.

317
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:33,297
Retroactively protecting
his bravery last night.

318
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:40,822
You do realize that
if you name that Negro,

319
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,557
the one that lacks
the good sense

320
00:30:42,656 --> 00:30:45,160
not to shoot down
a white man and he fails,

321
00:30:45,259 --> 00:30:47,427
it will be a setback
for the whole Negro race.

322
00:30:47,528 --> 00:30:49,931
- Senator, let me tell you--
- No, no, you hear me out.

323
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,432
You hear me out.

324
00:30:52,532 --> 00:30:56,336
I nominated you because
I trust your judgment.

325
00:30:56,436 --> 00:30:59,440
President Grant believes
in liberty of the Negro.

326
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:02,242
He is fighting that unrest
in the South.

327
00:31:02,343 --> 00:31:06,146
But in order to
protect our progress,

328
00:31:06,247 --> 00:31:09,384
we have to nurture the Negro.

329
00:31:09,483 --> 00:31:13,121
Not just set 'em fully free.

330
00:31:13,221 --> 00:31:16,257
I mean,
they're ready to be free,

331
00:31:16,356 --> 00:31:18,226
but are they ready to lead?

332
00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:20,260
And if he fails,

333
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:23,530
there's likely not to be another
one around for 100 years.

334
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:27,501
So, can you tell me just
what it is about this Negro

335
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:30,554
that makes you believe that he
is worthy to carry that burden?

336
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:35,375
Well, I don't know if it's fair

337
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,362
to hoist the burden of an entire
race upon his shoulders.

338
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:45,153
Your Honor,

339
00:31:45,252 --> 00:31:48,256
- I know you to be a man of the church.
- Yes, sir.

340
00:31:48,355 --> 00:31:51,893
- And the law.
- Mm-hmm.

341
00:31:51,992 --> 00:31:55,262
But are you willing to gamble
your seat on the bench for that man?

342
00:31:55,363 --> 00:31:57,047
I never gamble.

343
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,159
Deputy Marshal Reeves.

344
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:13,931
Well done, sir.

345
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:25,093
Judge, I'm sorry, but I've
buried my words far too long.

346
00:32:25,192 --> 00:32:27,528
Now, I fancy Mr. Reeves here
as a posseman.

347
00:32:27,627 --> 00:32:31,132
And you know I do,
but you bring a dishonor--

348
00:32:31,231 --> 00:32:34,167
a dishonor on the name of
the marshal by naming him.

349
00:32:34,268 --> 00:32:37,438
Franks, Negro or not,
in the course of a day,

350
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,440
I've known this man
to rescue a horse,

351
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,541
rescue an outlaw,
and bring him to justice,

352
00:32:41,642 --> 00:32:44,244
save a judge from perish
from five men,

353
00:32:44,345 --> 00:32:47,181
and refuse a payment worth
many times his monthly salary

354
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,416
simply to provide information.

355
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:52,653
Now, if those actions
do not quality that man there

356
00:32:52,753 --> 00:32:55,990
to ride as a deputy marshal
in my district,

357
00:32:56,089 --> 00:33:00,094
then I might just pull
the stars off every man here.

358
00:33:00,193 --> 00:33:03,463
- Judge, you're making--
- Including yours.

359
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,667
Man: No outlaw will file
for a black man with a badge.

360
00:33:06,768 --> 00:33:08,568
He'll be dead in a week.
Save them kids.

361
00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:11,506
Who said that?
Now, there will be order in this court.

362
00:33:11,605 --> 00:33:13,574
I'll clear this whole gallery.

363
00:33:13,673 --> 00:33:17,045
Delivery here Judge Parker.

364
00:33:17,144 --> 00:33:19,825
- I'm Judge Parker. Just set it there.
- Yes, sir. Okay. Yes, sir.

365
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,416
Judge, you may not know,

366
00:33:22,517 --> 00:33:24,352
why, Mr. Reeves here,
he can't read.

367
00:33:24,451 --> 00:33:27,336
And if he can't read,
well, he can't write.

368
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:31,607
Is that right, Bass?

369
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:37,397
That's right, sir.

370
00:33:37,498 --> 00:33:42,069
Can you tell me how is it
that you come to shoot

371
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,672
like a man possessed
but you can't read?

372
00:33:44,771 --> 00:33:48,643
My generation
was not born free.

373
00:33:48,742 --> 00:33:51,511
My master taught
me to shoot,

374
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,230
but he refused
to teach me to read.

375
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:58,452
Said that have
made me too dangerous.

376
00:33:58,552 --> 00:34:01,538
More dangerous than you are
with those Colts?

377
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:07,528
Well,
how in God's good name

378
00:34:07,627 --> 00:34:09,630
is he going to read a warrant

379
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:12,500
and ensure that he brings in
the right man?

380
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:16,170
We don't need litigation
by negligence

381
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:18,054
caused by a Negro.

382
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:23,460
- Um...
- Man: Tell him, Marshal Franks.

383
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:35,204
My husband may not read...

384
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:40,210
but you will respect him.

385
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:45,114
My husband Bass

386
00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:48,101
can be and will be

387
00:34:48,202 --> 00:34:52,188
a deputy worth remembering.

388
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,811
Okay, now,
we've heard you.

389
00:34:57,911 --> 00:34:59,563
We'll have order in this court.

390
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,769
May I?

391
00:35:06,721 --> 00:35:08,505
Bass, you know
I can't do that.

392
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:12,509
There are no coloreds
allowed in the bar.

393
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:20,577
What is that awful smell
in my courtroom?

394
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:39,447
Judge, I suspect the smell

395
00:36:39,547 --> 00:36:42,416
is coming from this here package.

396
00:36:42,516 --> 00:36:43,967
Open it up.

397
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:55,795
Judge, you ain't gonna like it.

398
00:36:55,896 --> 00:36:57,697
It's horrible, Judge, horrible.

399
00:36:57,797 --> 00:36:58,797
Jeez.

400
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:21,489
That head was a promise.

401
00:37:21,588 --> 00:37:24,525
It was a promise,
and it was a promise fulfilled.

402
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:26,594
Now, you let him
stay where he is.

403
00:37:26,693 --> 00:37:28,329
Should he make his way
into town,

404
00:37:28,429 --> 00:37:30,188
then you let the law
have its way with him.

405
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:31,932
Bruce went on a fool's errand.

406
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,782
and he returned home
slight of his body.

407
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:37,987
Well, be that as it may...

408
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:42,826
is there anyone here...

409
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,563
who will execute service of
this here warrant?

410
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,668
Anyone?

411
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:55,304
No one...

412
00:37:55,822 --> 00:37:58,525
under the authority
of this court here

413
00:37:58,626 --> 00:38:01,528
shall stand above the law.

414
00:38:01,628 --> 00:38:03,697
Judge, ain't nobody ill
enough in their right mind

415
00:38:03,797 --> 00:38:05,233
to take on that assignment.

416
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:06,932
You chase an animal
in its own habitat,

417
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,335
and it's simply suicide.

418
00:38:08,436 --> 00:38:09,835
I will.

419
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,891
Oh, that's good.

420
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,831
Mr. Reeves...

421
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,487
you aren't a deputy.

422
00:38:26,586 --> 00:38:29,639
It seems, sir, that we both have
a problem and a solution.

423
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:35,829
You need someone to put an end
to Dozier's terror,

424
00:38:35,929 --> 00:38:40,300
and I need to prove I would be
a more-than-capable deputy.

425
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,018
Both problems solved
by the same solution.

426
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,490
If I can bring him back,
you put a badge on my chest.

427
00:38:51,797 --> 00:38:53,981
So this man here,

428
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:58,585
who many of you feel isn't worthy
enough to strap your boots,

429
00:38:58,686 --> 00:39:02,972
this man has more courage
than any of you all combined.

430
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:08,978
Now, if I grant this request...

431
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,300
is there anybody
that will ride with him?

432
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,438
- I ride alone.
- No, Mr. Reeves.

433
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:19,773
As much as it might be
your inclination to do so,

434
00:39:19,873 --> 00:39:21,641
you will not ride alone.

435
00:39:21,742 --> 00:39:23,742
My orders.

436
00:39:24,077 --> 00:39:26,614
Who will ride with him?

437
00:39:26,713 --> 00:39:29,016
Ain't nobody going back
to hell to chase that man.

438
00:39:29,115 --> 00:39:32,719
We're kinda partial to having
our heads attached to our torso.

439
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,219
I will.

440
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:44,681
Pardon my crime, shit,
I'll ride with the nigger.

441
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:51,005
Well, you wouldn't be the first
outlaw put on a straight path

442
00:39:51,105 --> 00:39:53,708
by being a posseman.

443
00:39:53,807 --> 00:39:56,744
You are charged with
some serious crimes, sir.

444
00:39:56,844 --> 00:39:59,713
You would likely fall upon
the ground if put in prison

445
00:39:59,813 --> 00:40:01,916
being as old as you are.

446
00:40:02,016 --> 00:40:05,768
Upon execution of this warrant
with Mr. Reeves here...

447
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,440
I will pardon you.

448
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,628
- What's his name?
- Charlie Storm.

449
00:40:14,728 --> 00:40:16,530
Pleased to meet you.

450
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,898
All right,
you ain't so bad

451
00:40:18,998 --> 00:40:20,958
for somebody that hung
all them sons of bitches.

452
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,737
Oh, I get it.

453
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:28,775
We got a Negro
and a senile old man

454
00:40:28,876 --> 00:40:32,027
to bring in the most notorious
outlaw in this territory.

455
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,699

00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,070

478

What you do...

479
00:42:06,907 --> 00:42:09,092
when the whole world
doesn't believe in you?

480
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:15,965
You make believers out of
every last one of 'em.

481
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:27,175
Man: That rain's coming down.
Should we get some cover?

482
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:32,248
I think it'll pass.

483
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,875
Think it's smart
to leave town?

484
00:42:40,974 --> 00:42:43,043
I don't think anyone
will bother us again.

485
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:46,146
Thing about the government
is they don't like to lose.

486
00:42:46,246 --> 00:42:49,617
Won't pick a fight
if the decks are stacked.

487
00:42:49,717 --> 00:42:52,786
Around here, we own the decks.
They know that.

488
00:42:52,885 --> 00:42:54,704
Let's ride.

489
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:19,746
I need to see
Judge Parker now, missy.

490
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,615
I have orders from his boss,
President Grant,

491
00:43:22,715 --> 00:43:24,784
not to appoint
Bass Reeves U.S. Marshal

492
00:43:24,885 --> 00:43:27,704
and to have him
arrested forthwith.

493
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:30,925
I'm sorry, Senator.

494
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,992
Judge Parker's not
in the office today.

495
00:43:33,092 --> 00:43:35,177
Nor is Mr. Reeves.

496
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:40,134
- Where in the hell is he?
- I don't know, sir.

497
00:43:40,233 --> 00:43:43,336
But they both have a home.

498
00:43:43,436 --> 00:43:45,788
I'll be sure to pass
the message along.

499
00:43:47,192 --> 00:43:48,625
Have good day now.

500
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:02,755
Nellie,
would you send Bass out,

501
00:44:02,856 --> 00:44:05,858
so we can allow him to answer
to the proper authority?

502
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:08,210
It ain't nothing
he needs to answer for.

503
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:14,835
Gentlemen,
Mr. Reeves is not here.

504
00:44:14,934 --> 00:44:18,739
And it would behoove you
to lay those arms aside.

505
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:22,009
Should one of her innocent
children get harmed,

506
00:44:22,108 --> 00:44:23,943
I dare not be the man

507
00:44:24,043 --> 00:44:26,847
to stand between
that person and Bass Reeves.

508
00:44:26,947 --> 00:44:29,617
Put your arms away, boys.

509
00:44:29,717 --> 00:44:31,851
It'd be nice
if you did, too, ma'am.

510
00:44:31,952 --> 00:44:34,788
I have orders here
from President Grant,

511
00:44:34,887 --> 00:44:37,358
delivered from Senator Smith,

512
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:39,626
that Mr. Reeves stand trial.

513
00:44:39,726 --> 00:44:41,695
Should they succeed in their endeavor,

514
00:44:41,795 --> 00:44:44,347
I'll take it up with
President Grant myself.

515
00:44:46,418 --> 00:44:49,103
- If not--
- No "if not."

516
00:44:49,202 --> 00:44:51,387
Bass Reeves is coming home.

517
00:44:52,824 --> 00:44:55,458
Of course.
Sorry, ma'am.

518
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:12,909
See all them men got
sent to their grave?

519
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:17,146
Son of bitches no better
than the outlaws out here.

520
00:45:33,498 --> 00:45:36,083
You know,
I'm gonna just pull my horse
up and turn around

521
00:45:36,182 --> 00:45:38,251
if I don't get some straight talk.

522
00:45:38,351 --> 00:45:43,023
All right, wait a minute,
how's a nigger get land?

523
00:45:43,123 --> 00:45:45,391
You can't own land,
can you?

524
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,427
You got a pretty wife,
you know.

525
00:45:47,527 --> 00:45:50,007
How'd an ugly son of a bitch
like you get such a pretty wife?

526
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,731
Don't you speak of my wife.

527
00:45:51,831 --> 00:45:54,001
Oh, so he can talk.

528
00:45:54,101 --> 00:45:57,103
- I talk when I need it.
- Uh-huh.

529
00:45:57,204 --> 00:46:00,407
- And don't you speak of my wife.
- All right.

530
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,175
Don't you worry about it.

531
00:46:02,275 --> 00:46:04,327
I'm not gonna speak at all.

532
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:31,304
I don't know if you realize this,

533
00:46:31,405 --> 00:46:33,556
but you can't get him without me.

534
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:39,161
I don't need you
or nobody out here.

535
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:12,295
We've been riding for two days.
We haven't seen a soul.

536
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:24,992
You even have a plan,
or you just get up and go?

537
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,059
No time to plan.

538
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:29,429
Well, shit, there's
always time for planning.

539
00:47:29,528 --> 00:47:33,567
Plans are the difference between
being a cow rustler and a spirit pusher

540
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:37,106
and being wanted for killing
somebody
and having to face that hanging
judge of yours.

541
00:47:36,637 --> 00:47:39,039
What you trying to say?

542
00:47:39,139 --> 00:47:41,018
You done killed somebody
and got away with it?

543
00:47:40,974 --> 00:47:43,076
I'm just saying what I said.

544
00:47:43,175 --> 00:47:45,445
Yo, shut up, Charlie.

545
00:47:45,545 --> 00:47:48,382
You ain't nothing but bluster.

546
00:47:48,481 --> 00:47:51,318
Probably can't even hit a lick.

547
00:47:51,418 --> 00:47:54,454
Can't even hit a buffalo in a herd.

548
00:47:54,554 --> 00:47:56,954
- Shit.
- You know, I'm starting to
think riding to Detroit

549
00:47:56,523 --> 00:47:59,893
would've been easier on
my nerves than riding with you.

550
00:47:59,992 --> 00:48:02,829
You know, your pardon doesn't depend
on how many words you speak.

551
00:48:02,929 --> 00:48:07,333
Oh, I know.
I just find joy in talking.

552
00:48:07,434 --> 00:48:10,603
Besides, you should thank
that God you sing to

553
00:48:10,704 --> 00:48:12,554
I can shoot
pretty good, too.

554
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:16,210
Yeah, okay.

555
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:17,309
Okay?

556
00:48:19,264 --> 00:48:20,264
Okay?

557
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:23,617
Yeah, okay.

558
00:48:23,717 --> 00:48:24,916
Point.

559
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,954
- We do not have time for this.
- No, no, no, no.

560
00:48:28,054 --> 00:48:30,023
You just called
my ability into question.

561
00:48:30,123 --> 00:48:32,159
Let me put your mind at ease.

562
00:48:32,259 --> 00:48:34,539
I'm either going to prove you
right or wrong. Now point.

563
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,603
That rock.

564
00:48:42,702 --> 00:48:44,702
Which one?

565
00:48:45,304 --> 00:48:47,344
- All right, let me bring it closer.
- No, no, no.

566
00:48:47,373 --> 00:48:50,077
You don't have to bring it closer.

567
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,278
The big rock in between the--

568
00:48:52,378 --> 00:48:53,996
- In between the trees.
- I got you.

569
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:02,103
That wasn't me.

570
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,077
Let's go.

571
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:15,088
Why'd you tear off
like that?

572
00:51:15,188 --> 00:51:17,456
They needed help,
I helped.

573
00:51:17,556 --> 00:51:20,527
You don't get it, do you?
Them people might've been dead.

574
00:51:20,626 --> 00:51:23,429
You just go off without no plan.

575
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:25,331
Just tear off like that.

576
00:51:25,431 --> 00:51:27,592
Don't they teach you niggers
anything about patience?

577
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,318
You're such a coon.

578
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:40,380
That is the last time
you use that word around me.

579
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,664
That's why you swung on me?

580
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,253
I-- I don't mean nothing by it!

581
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,655
That's what my pappy
taught me.

582
00:51:48,755 --> 00:51:50,724
Horse, nig--

583
00:51:50,824 --> 00:51:52,474
Okay, okay, okay.

584
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:57,130
It don't mean nothing
coming from me.

585
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:59,630
- Well, it means something coming to me.
- Well, all right.

586
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:05,489
Shit.

587
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:09,224
All I'm trying to say is...

588
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:16,083
- ...you're all coon and no crow.
- What?

589
00:52:16,182 --> 00:52:18,452
Coon, coon. You know,
an animal-- coon.

590
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,686
He come into your house,
he takes what he wants,

591
00:52:20,786 --> 00:52:22,556
and he leaves, he's fearless.

592
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:25,425
Now, a crow.
A crow wants a nut,

593
00:52:25,525 --> 00:52:28,724
he don't want to break his beak.
He'll
drop that nut in the middle of the road,

594
00:52:28,295 --> 00:52:31,264
wait for a wagon to come by,
break it, pick it up,

595
00:52:31,364 --> 00:52:33,199
take his bounty and leave.

596
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,768
It's called patience.

597
00:52:34,867 --> 00:52:36,507
Now, you making no sense,
Charlie Storm.

598
00:52:36,536 --> 00:52:37,871
I'm making a lot of sense.

599
00:52:37,971 --> 00:52:39,922
And you'll get it...

600
00:52:42,527 --> 00:52:44,110
as soon as you get it.

601
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,880
Gentlemen,
sorry to disturb your brotherly spat,

602
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,197
but the sun'll be set
before you settle.

00:53:16,827 --> 00:53:18,777
Why you getting shot at?

609
00:53:18,878 --> 00:53:21,847
Well, we been moving
our people from the south

610
00:53:21,947 --> 00:53:24,717
to this fertile ground in Kansas.

611
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:27,753
Been doing that since '72.

612
00:53:27,853 --> 00:53:30,856
But the federal government
been moving their troops out the south.

613
00:53:30,956 --> 00:53:33,293
So we had to find
a new route.

614
00:53:33,393 --> 00:53:35,628
You should come.

615
00:53:35,728 --> 00:53:38,164
Just planted our first collard.

616
00:53:38,264 --> 00:53:40,666
Been fetchin' for people.

617
00:53:40,766 --> 00:53:42,802
Got about 600 right now.

618
00:53:42,902 --> 00:53:44,637
I got land.

619
00:53:44,737 --> 00:53:47,474
- You own it?
- I homestead it.

620
00:53:47,574 --> 00:53:50,744
'66, when the law changed.

621
00:53:50,844 --> 00:53:52,760
Became a citizen.

622
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:56,882
Federal government approved me.

623
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:59,952
Homestead.
You heard of taxes?

624
00:54:00,052 --> 00:54:01,836
Landlords?

625
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:07,293
I was an undertaker
back there in Nashville.

626
00:54:07,393 --> 00:54:09,628
And sometimes
I'd have to bury fathers.

627
00:54:09,728 --> 00:54:12,965
Maybe by the next morning,

628
00:54:13,065 --> 00:54:15,869
that landlord would
go to that mother,

629
00:54:15,969 --> 00:54:18,572
she'd have about
six or seven children.

630
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:21,240
And that landlord would tell her,

631
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,909
"Your husband owed me
before he died."

632
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,778
And then he'd say,

633
00:54:25,878 --> 00:54:29,664
"You have to go some other
place, I cannot take care of you."

634
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,820
Now, that's something
I would take notice of.

635
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,757
Sooner or later,
you find her coming out
some disorderly house.

636
00:54:37,856 --> 00:54:40,226
And those children?

637
00:54:40,327 --> 00:54:42,695
State prison.

638
00:54:42,795 --> 00:54:45,898
Sounds like tales of Exodus.

639
00:54:45,998 --> 00:54:49,302
I thought old Abe set you free.

640
00:54:49,402 --> 00:54:51,670
Although the law
say we free,

641
00:54:51,771 --> 00:54:55,742
the South still sends for us
with money on our heads.

642
00:54:55,842 --> 00:54:58,744
They call that a Southern
bounty group.

643
00:54:58,844 --> 00:55:01,280
Southern country
is out of joint, sir.

644
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:03,817
And it's coming west.

645
00:55:03,916 --> 00:55:06,253
They running out
of land already.

646
00:55:06,353 --> 00:55:08,722
And when they come,

647
00:55:08,822 --> 00:55:11,657
they're bringing all
their ills with them.

648
00:55:11,757 --> 00:55:13,157
I know,

649
00:55:14,494 --> 00:55:17,630
the blood of a white man
runs through my veins.

650
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:21,367
There is some good white men
in the Southern country.

651
00:55:21,467 --> 00:55:25,038
But it ain't the majority,
to which you just might fit.

652
00:55:25,137 --> 00:55:26,137
Yeah.

653
00:55:27,474 --> 00:55:29,358
Maybe I would.

654
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:35,914
Maybe you just don't know
what you want, but I do.

655
00:55:36,014 --> 00:55:38,550
I want to shut my eyes

656
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:40,653
without the sound
of white oppression

657
00:55:40,753 --> 00:55:42,688
coursing through my ears.

658
00:55:42,789 --> 00:55:45,507
I got a mission, and I'm gonna
need to get rested for it.

659
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:50,978
We gotta finish some work
we started days ago.

660
00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:56,335
We'll take you
to the next town over.

661
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:59,121
See that you get a wagon
and a horse.

662
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:03,759
You'll be all right
in Cherokee land.

663
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:52,208
Fellas?

664
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:56,996
Fellas.

665
00:56:57,096 --> 00:56:58,096
Whoa.

666
00:56:59,097 --> 00:57:02,483
I think you and the lady
might be lost.

667
00:57:04,155 --> 00:57:06,472
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

668
00:57:06,572 --> 00:57:08,141
You can't do that in my territory.

669
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,143
Your territory?

670
00:57:11,244 --> 00:57:13,112
Man as handsome
and strong as yourself

671
00:57:13,213 --> 00:57:14,981
needn't worry about us.

672
00:57:15,081 --> 00:57:16,682
We're just wandering.

673
00:57:16,782 --> 00:57:19,018
- We don't want any trouble, either.
- Mm-mm.

674
00:57:19,117 --> 00:57:22,121
A couple of my men
were gunned down.

675
00:57:22,222 --> 00:57:23,922
We're looking
for who's responsible.

676
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:27,559
- Well, that wouldn't be--
- Why do you care?

677
00:57:27,659 --> 00:57:29,528
Why do I care?

678
00:57:29,628 --> 00:57:32,965
I'm saying, are they kin to you?

679
00:57:33,065 --> 00:57:35,802
- They got to be kin for me to care?
- Maybe not.

680
00:57:35,902 --> 00:57:37,836
But to approach a stranger
seeking information,

681
00:57:37,936 --> 00:57:41,056
I would judge you to be kin or crazy.

682
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:45,844
Well, I ain't kin.

683
00:57:45,945 --> 00:57:48,730
Well, then you must be crazy.

684
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:55,722
I didn't get your name.

685
00:57:55,822 --> 00:57:58,690
Well, I'm Frank James.

686
00:57:58,791 --> 00:58:00,559
This is my brother Jesse.

687
00:58:00,659 --> 00:58:02,161
And this firecracker
right here,

688
00:58:02,262 --> 00:58:04,530
- well, that's Belle.
- Belle?

689
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:07,867
Belle Starr,
of the Sam Starr Gang.

690
00:58:07,967 --> 00:58:12,639
So if that name means something,
I suggest you be on your way.

691
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:16,809
James, of the Younger Gang?

692
00:58:16,909 --> 00:58:20,045
Yeah, they call us that.

693
00:58:20,146 --> 00:58:22,715
Well, thanks for the information
on your compadre.

694
00:58:22,815 --> 00:58:26,085
I think we'll be going to find him
now and congratulate him.

695
00:58:26,184 --> 00:58:27,184
Okay.

696
00:58:28,253 --> 00:58:29,956
What'd you put inside
of the hole?

697
00:58:30,056 --> 00:58:32,655
Just our dog.

698
00:58:32,791 --> 00:58:34,927
That's a mighty big
hole for a dog.

699
00:58:35,027 --> 00:58:36,911
He was a mighty big dog.

700
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,320
Come on.

701
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:03,088
You kin to him?

702
00:59:03,188 --> 00:59:06,659
- Do I look like him?
- Little bit.

703
00:59:06,759 --> 00:59:09,262
Sure don't sound like him,
though. Where you from?

704
00:59:09,362 --> 00:59:11,164
Scotland.

705
00:59:11,264 --> 00:59:13,032
Where's that?

706
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:16,536
Europe. Read about it.
Pinkerton's from there.

707
00:59:16,635 --> 00:59:19,873
Pinkerton? You mean that motherfucker--
can't catch Jesse James?

708
00:59:19,972 --> 00:59:20,972
Yeah.

709
00:59:24,795 --> 00:59:26,929
He's about as skillful as...

710
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:33,001
What's going on up there?

711
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,213
We got to go.

712
00:59:54,992 --> 00:59:56,842
Having a plan would
come in real handy

713
00:59:56,943 --> 00:59:59,126
about now, wouldn't it?

714
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,983
Who are you?

715
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:07,483
Bass Reeves.

716
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,759
We don't want no trouble.

717
01:00:12,858 --> 01:00:14,793
Maybe trouble seeks you.

718
01:00:14,893 --> 01:00:16,929
Sheriff,
excuse my friend here.

719
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,264
He-- He said he knew
this land here.

720
01:00:19,364 --> 01:00:21,701
If we knew this was your piece,
we could have avoided

721
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,902
this whole unfortunate confrontation.

722
01:00:24,003 --> 01:00:26,204
- Shut up, old man.
- Yes, sir.

723
01:00:26,304 --> 01:00:28,724
Man: You say your name
was Bass Reeves?

724
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:33,528
Who asks?

725
01:00:33,945 --> 01:00:36,882
My goodness,
thought you was Dick Lassen's boys

726
01:00:36,983 --> 01:00:38,983
riding behind us to get
their piece of vengeance.

727
01:00:39,018 --> 01:00:40,018
Sam?

728
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:56,217
- Sam Sixkiller.
- Mm-hmm.

729
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:03,175
This here is Sam Sixkiller.

730
01:01:03,275 --> 01:01:04,960
He took me in
when I left my men.

731
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,364
When I left the war.

732
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,954
Saved my life.

733
01:01:16,054 --> 01:01:19,692
What kind of name
is Sam Sixkiller?

734
01:01:19,791 --> 01:01:21,842
And this here
is Charlie Storm.

735
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,833
Your friends?

736
01:01:26,932 --> 01:01:28,300
Mm-hmm.

737
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,137
What are you doing
in these parts, Bass?

738
01:01:31,237 --> 01:01:34,840
I thought you was too fancy
to visit these lands again, huh?

739
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:36,842
I'm just heading
to Muskogee for now.

740
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:39,778
Mm-hmm, me too.
Sun's setting,

741
01:01:39,878 --> 01:01:41,681
why don't you come
rest up in town,

742
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:43,364
get that looked after.

743
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:57,112
Bass?

744
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:04,251
You all have an open
invitation to join us.

745
01:02:05,856 --> 01:02:08,141
We would, but we can't.

746
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,208
Bass has got a family back home

747
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,588
depending on us getting back
and finishing this mission.

748
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:15,797
Mm-hmm. I understand.

749
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:25,340
You be careful, though.
Make you drowsy.

750
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:34,166
You believe that?

751
01:02:34,266 --> 01:02:36,436
About what?

752
01:02:36,536 --> 01:02:38,471
The white man took his land.

753
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:41,474
Well, you white.
You own land?

754
01:02:41,574 --> 01:02:45,711
Oh, I had land.
They took it too.

755
01:02:45,811 --> 01:02:48,280
They? They, who?

756
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:51,083
Well, Confederates
took it first.

757
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:54,186
That brought the Union
soldiers to my doorstep.

758
01:02:54,286 --> 01:02:57,090
Then the Union took it, kept it.

759
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:00,876
What about your wife, offspring?

760
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:05,981
No.

761
01:03:21,565 --> 01:03:24,983
So, what's this mission?
You on the hunt?

762
01:03:25,083 --> 01:03:26,083
Yeah.

763
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:28,221
Who would that be?

764
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,137
Bob Dozier.

765
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:36,795
We should get a drink.

766
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,864
- I don't--
- I'll drink for the both of us.

767
01:03:38,965 --> 01:03:40,282
All right.

Bass.

778
01:04:29,347 --> 01:04:32,117
You hear a single word of this?

779
01:04:32,217 --> 01:04:34,420
I apologize, man.

780
01:04:34,519 --> 01:04:38,190
Thought I was gonna have to have
a word with Charlie over there.

781
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:41,960
He's quite a character,
isn't he?

782
01:04:42,061 --> 01:04:46,498
You know that man you seek?
He's as bad as they come.

783
01:04:46,599 --> 01:04:49,467
We come from the same place,

784
01:04:49,568 --> 01:04:52,038
breathe the same air.

785
01:04:52,137 --> 01:04:55,007
If he's as bad
as you say he is,

786
01:04:55,106 --> 01:04:57,425
what that make me?

787
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:00,563
Huh?!

788
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:07,085
Dick Lassen is as mean as
that man's pinkie toe.

789
01:05:07,186 --> 01:05:09,288
Now, I don't run from
a fight, you know that.

790
01:05:09,387 --> 01:05:11,224
But I would not pursue him.

791
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,425
I ain't ever met
a man that mean.

792
01:05:13,525 --> 01:05:15,260
Or that fast.

793
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,096
Not even you, Bass.

794
01:05:17,195 --> 01:05:18,755
Well, you haven't
seen me for a while.

795
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:20,481
No. No, I haven't.

796
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:25,905
Look, he sent a man's head

797
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:30,041
with a badge attached
to his eye to a judge.

798
01:05:30,141 --> 01:05:33,612
Don't you never mind,
'cause I don't know where he is.

799
01:05:33,713 --> 01:05:36,030
Not many do.

800
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:46,574
Whoa.

801
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:51,664
Whoa, easy guys.

802
01:05:51,764 --> 01:05:52,764
Easy.

803
01:05:56,954 --> 01:05:58,552
It's just me.

804
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,224
I have a message for Dozier.

805
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:16,021
Any creature
that would leave to die, the delegate,

806
01:06:16,121 --> 01:06:19,541
they warrant any punishment
that befalls them.

807
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:45,199
Negro, speaks Creek...

808
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:51,206
shot five men before
they could draw.

809
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:55,076
Right,
and he's looking for me.

810
01:06:57,313 --> 01:07:00,414
Well, I guess my last message
wasn't loud enough.

811
01:07:02,052 --> 01:07:04,719
Government man wants
to find me, Negro or not...

812
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:09,608
well, I'll make it easy for 'em.

They're gonna be just fine.

Yeah.

838
01:08:45,822 --> 01:08:48,555
What is it, Sam?

839
01:08:52,662 --> 01:08:55,747
I just never thought of you
as a law man.

840
01:08:55,847 --> 01:08:58,332
Not after what the law
did to you.

841
01:08:59,703 --> 01:09:02,136
The law put me in chains.

842
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:07,126
But the law also set me free.

843
01:09:07,225 --> 01:09:10,162
Now, I got six little ones,
and I need to stay free.

844
01:09:10,261 --> 01:09:11,261
Six?

845
01:09:11,729 --> 01:09:14,166
Gracious, Bass,

846
01:09:14,265 --> 01:09:16,818
you wearing that poor woman
out, ain't you?

847
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,783
I hear there's a black boy
seeking my whereabouts.

848
01:09:31,884 --> 01:09:33,684
It's him.

849
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:44,329
It's Dozier!

850
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,430
No.

851
01:09:47,184 --> 01:09:48,850
Seek no more, here I am.

852
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:05,701
Bass?

853
01:10:07,737 --> 01:10:10,555
He rides into my town,
we'll take him together, Bass.

854
01:10:10,655 --> 01:10:14,560
No, he rides into your town
for me, it's me he gets.

855
01:10:14,659 --> 01:10:16,828
You can't face him alone.

856
01:10:16,929 --> 01:10:20,599
Even if I can't,
you with your one arm,

857
01:10:20,698 --> 01:10:22,701
it's not gonna be much help.

858
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:24,720
I can shoot with one
better than most with two,

859
01:10:24,703 --> 01:10:26,438
you know that, Bass.

860
01:10:26,537 --> 01:10:28,537
Sixkiller,

861
01:10:29,341 --> 01:10:32,444
you saved a drowning boy once.

862
01:10:32,543 --> 01:10:34,561
Let that man repay you.

863
01:10:35,966 --> 01:10:37,550
You got two minutes.

864
01:10:37,649 --> 01:10:39,333
I won't need 'em.

865
01:10:54,251 --> 01:10:56,016
Don't tell me
you went coward on me.

866
01:11:14,871 --> 01:11:18,289
Well, I'll be damned.

867
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:20,807
That young Indian was right.

868
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:26,332
A Negro on a quest for me.

869
01:11:26,431 --> 01:11:28,048
Bob Dozier...

870
01:11:30,287 --> 01:11:33,954
I have a warrant for your arrest.

871
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,511
A Negro with that warrant
has no authority here.

872
01:11:39,610 --> 01:11:40,761
Oh, but he does.

873
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:44,798
And so do I.

874
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:53,891
I'm gonna
excuse your ignorance,

875
01:11:53,992 --> 01:11:55,909
give you a chance
to claim your life.

876
01:11:58,014 --> 01:12:00,966
Thank you, Mr. Dozier.

877
01:12:01,065 --> 01:12:02,949
I will return.

878
01:12:07,524 --> 01:12:10,809
But not without executing
this warrant.

879
01:12:10,908 --> 01:12:14,309
Dead... or alive.

880
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:22,320
Is that the way
you want it to be?

881
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:24,439
That's the way it is.

882
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:44,826
Your move, boy.

883
01:13:37,514 --> 01:13:39,046
Dead or alive.

884
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,582
Got one, boy!

885
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:32,511
Bass hasn't
been seen in a week,

886
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:34,512
and he's feared dead.

887
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:37,731
President Grant will be here
in two days.

888
01:16:22,878 --> 01:16:24,845
Let's take him together, Bass.

889
01:16:26,716 --> 01:16:30,184

a drowning boy once.

895
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:18,198
Spanish Fort,
about a half a day's ride.

896
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:24,971
You thinking about going alone?

897
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:29,293
Well, you got one arm,

898
01:17:29,394 --> 01:17:30,962
you liquored,

899
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:33,247

All right.

901
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:41,322
Go on, then...

902
01:17:44,027 --> 01:17:47,028
make a widow of your wife,
orphan of them kids.

903

Bad-ass Bass Reeves.

905

The man who rides
with nobody by his side.

906
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:02,342
Shit. Well, go on.

907
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:08,948
He may be slow of tongue,
but his words are sharp.

908
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:14,405
Now, Dozier
may have some men,

909
01:18:14,506 --> 01:18:15,974
but he don't need
them anymore--

910
01:18:16,073 --> 01:18:17,992
Well, what good are you?!

911
01:18:19,362 --> 01:18:21,979
You got one arm.

912
01:18:22,079 --> 01:18:24,364
You can't even go a day
without drinking.

913
01:18:26,469 --> 01:18:28,819
The border's right there.

914
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,822
Why don't you run?

915
01:18:30,921 --> 01:18:33,340
You don't have to finish.

916
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:44,970
Buddy, I seen what you did
to Dozier's men.

917
01:18:45,069 --> 01:18:48,172
If you only had some help.

918
01:18:48,273 --> 01:18:51,710
I mean, what I'm trying
to say is,

919
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:53,278
if you insist on going

920
01:18:53,377 --> 01:18:55,762
after what you now know...

921
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,451
then fuck it!

922
01:18:59,551 --> 01:19:01,420
I'll go too.

923
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:04,722
But we better pray
my boots become unstuck.

924
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:08,025
Yeah, I could run.
I could be headed for the border.

925
01:19:08,126 --> 01:19:10,261
Keep taking what I want,

926
01:19:10,362 --> 01:19:13,899
shoot anybody who doesn't
want to give it to me.

927
01:19:13,998 --> 01:19:17,034
Or maybe
I could do something.

928
01:19:17,135 --> 01:19:19,871
You know, something...

929
01:19:19,970 --> 01:19:23,041
Worthy...
of a proper obit.

930
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:24,140
Huh?

931
01:19:26,194 --> 01:19:27,994
Something worth writing about.

932
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:35,301
Why don't you go home?
You're the one with the family.

933
01:19:36,773 --> 01:19:39,990
Leave this fool's errand
to this coward here.

934
01:19:40,091 --> 01:19:43,210
And this old drunk outlaw.

935
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:54,488
If I leave...

936
01:19:55,239 --> 01:19:58,091
Who's gonna save ya
from the fool's folly?

937
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:01,828
Thatta boy!

938
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,900
Thatta boy.

939
01:20:15,011 --> 01:20:16,011
Yow!

940
01:21:01,224 --> 01:21:03,341
"I'll annointest my hand with oil.

Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me

943
01:21:08,913 --> 01:21:11,198
all the days of my life."

944
01:21:59,215 --> 01:22:02,234
40 men on three.

945
01:22:02,333 --> 01:22:05,302
That's not odds I'd take
if I was a gambler.

946
01:22:05,403 --> 01:22:08,305
Yeah, you win at them odds,
you a legend.

947
01:22:08,405 --> 01:22:12,243
All right,
we wait till nightfall,

948
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:14,578
circle the town,

949
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:17,515
then we jump them
before daybreak.

950
01:22:17,614 --> 01:22:20,585
That's it?
That's what you want to do?

951
01:22:20,685 --> 01:22:22,970
That's why we came.

952
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:27,626
We circled this before,
and there were six of us,

953
01:22:27,725 --> 01:22:29,261
or five.

954
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:31,595
And he was alone.

955
01:22:31,695 --> 01:22:33,899
And he still lives.

956
01:22:33,998 --> 01:22:35,900
Did you go in by surprise?

957
01:22:36,001 --> 01:22:37,668
No, the stupid bastard
announced--

958
01:22:37,769 --> 01:22:40,905
Well, you don't knock
on the Devil's door and ask to come in.

959
01:22:41,006 --> 01:22:44,242
You wait till nightfall.

960
01:22:44,341 --> 01:22:47,444
You go in real quiet-like,
you take out every man that's posted.

961
01:22:47,545 --> 01:22:50,015
You make your way
through the house,

962
01:22:50,114 --> 01:22:53,284
you get to his bedroom,
you surround the motherfucker,

963
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:56,020
he comes out with you.

964
01:22:56,121 --> 01:22:58,072
Dead or alive.

965
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:02,309

969
01:23:35,393 --> 01:23:38,128
Then the boss rides up,
lights some dynamite,

970
01:23:38,229 --> 01:23:40,030
tosses it in the house,

971
01:23:40,131 --> 01:23:42,067
we ride off, and then boom!

972
01:23:42,167 --> 01:23:44,168
Whole ground shook.

973
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:46,119
Is that it?

974
01:24:18,487 --> 01:24:20,704

No, I'm good.

01:24:25,261 --> 01:24:28,479
I'm gonna go sleep off this fun.

977
01:24:28,579 --> 01:24:31,716
The stage comes through tomorrow.

01:24:31,815 --> 01:24:34,568

996
01:25:44,855 --> 01:25:46,591
I'm just passing through.

997
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:49,091
You the law?

998
01:25:49,293 --> 01:25:52,162
I don't know of any colored
lawmen around these parts.

999
01:25:52,262 --> 01:25:53,863
Come on.

1000
01:25:54,666 --> 01:25:56,865
Oh! Easy...

1001
01:25:57,702 --> 01:26:00,771
If you've come for Dozier,
we ain't got no quarrel.

1002
01:26:00,872 --> 01:26:03,541
I do what I do out here
just not to die.

1003
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:05,510
Where does Dozier
keep his horse?

1004
01:26:05,609 --> 01:26:07,811
Outside his house.

1005
01:26:07,912 --> 01:26:09,713
Especially since that
marshal showed up,

1006
01:26:09,814 --> 01:26:11,532
woods are dangerous over there.

1007
01:26:19,408 --> 01:26:21,341
You're a lucky man.

1008
01:27:46,929 --> 01:27:49,429
Lord,
tell me if I should act now.

1009
01:27:56,738 --> 01:27:59,356
I'm sorry, Lord.

1010
01:27:59,457 --> 01:28:01,774
I was kind of hoping
you'd be louder.

1011
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:07,046
But you didn't say no.

1012
01:28:48,524 --> 01:28:51,557
You killed a dear
friend of mine.

1013
01:28:53,028 --> 01:28:55,028
You tried to kill me too.

1014
01:28:56,765 --> 01:28:58,349
You didn't die.

1015
01:28:58,448 --> 01:29:01,019
Like I said before,

1016
01:29:01,118 --> 01:29:04,588
I'm here to return you to Fort Smith.

1017
01:29:04,689 --> 01:29:08,626
By the power given me
by the Federal Court.

1018
01:29:08,725 --> 01:29:10,877
You can cackle all you want.

1019
01:29:13,047 --> 01:29:15,832
You and no Federal Court
has any jurisdiction over me.

1020
01:29:15,932 --> 01:29:18,652
Then maybe I'll just
shoot you dead now.

1021
01:29:21,422 --> 01:29:23,341
Just pull this trigger.

1022
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,076
You won't.

1023
01:29:25,176 --> 01:29:27,394
'Cause you ain't me.

1024
01:29:29,832 --> 01:29:32,417
You don't like to shoot first
or you would have done so

1025
01:29:32,516 --> 01:29:34,051
when my men surrounded you, no?

1026
01:29:34,152 --> 01:29:35,551
But me?

1027
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:38,505
I'd shoot you dead.

1028
01:29:40,376 --> 01:29:42,743
You better be a good shot.

1029
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:47,546
I'm better than good.

1030
01:29:49,518 --> 01:29:51,735
Did you know I used to be
a deputy marshal?

1031
01:29:51,836 --> 01:29:54,439
- That doesn't matter.
- It matters.

1032
01:29:54,538 --> 01:29:58,743
But your government
accused me a robbery.

1033
01:29:58,842 --> 01:30:00,793
Stripped me of my star.

1034
01:30:02,597 --> 01:30:04,649
And lashed me to confess,

1035
01:30:04,748 --> 01:30:05,917
locked me up.

1036
01:30:06,016 --> 01:30:08,453
I lost my family.

1037
01:30:08,552 --> 01:30:10,454
Yellow fever.

1038
01:30:10,555 --> 01:30:12,471
Couldn't do nothing.

1039
01:30:15,144 --> 01:30:18,762
My Annie was the purest
thing I'd ever seen.

1040
01:30:18,863 --> 01:30:21,948
So was my Corina,
but they met the dirt.

1041
01:30:23,685 --> 01:30:25,502
Like an outlaw.

1042
01:30:25,603 --> 01:30:29,474
Because law wasn't reasonable,

1043
01:30:29,573 --> 01:30:32,377
and my wife and my baby died.

1044
01:30:32,476 --> 01:30:35,529
It was made very clear to me
that I was to pursue my earnest desires.

1045
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:39,751
Because living is to live...

1046
01:30:39,850 --> 01:30:41,701
and then you die.

1047
01:30:45,541 --> 01:30:47,759
That may well be.

1048
01:30:47,859 --> 01:30:52,796
Jim Bruce, Sam Sixkiller,
Belle Starr's
brother no longer living, and you are.

1049
01:30:52,896 --> 01:30:57,016
But you gonna do your living
and dying in Detroit prison.

1050
01:31:25,646 --> 01:31:28,832
Oh, you ain't leaving here
tonight, colored boy!

1051
01:31:28,932 --> 01:31:31,083
You should have thought
this through.

1052
01:32:01,582 --> 01:32:02,582
Ah!

1053
01:32:20,202 --> 01:32:21,801
Get him!

1054
01:32:38,953 --> 01:32:40,554
Charlie!

1055
01:33:57,733 --> 01:33:59,132
Giddup!

1056
01:34:02,804 --> 01:34:04,703
Go get that son of a bitch!

1057
01:34:42,778 --> 01:34:45,328
Now, it's too dangerous
for you.

1058
01:34:45,429 --> 01:34:47,814
I'm gonna be back.

1059
01:34:49,117 --> 01:34:51,167
But if I don't,

1060
01:34:51,268 --> 01:34:54,148
you make sure you take Nellie
and my
little ones where they need to be.

1061
01:37:38,587 --> 01:37:40,386
Cheer up.

1062
01:38:34,242 --> 01:38:37,060
I gotta give it to you!

1063
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:40,296
Only one moving!

1064
01:38:40,396 --> 01:38:43,300
You and me would've made a hell
of a team in another life,

1065
01:38:43,399 --> 01:38:45,217
nigger and all.

1066
01:38:48,222 --> 01:38:50,957
Why don't you come out now
and have a fair fight?

1067
01:40:10,572 --> 01:40:13,189
I told you, lawman,

1068
01:40:13,289 --> 01:40:15,440
government doesn't have
any jurisdiction over me.

1069
01:40:47,742 --> 01:40:50,510
Dead or alive.

1070
01:41:33,787 --> 01:41:35,372
Thank you.

1071
01:41:35,471 --> 01:41:38,375
Well, old man,
you got the spirit to ride

1072
01:41:38,475 --> 01:41:40,511
or should I just
retire you here?

1073
01:41:40,610 --> 01:41:42,411
You wish.

1074
01:41:42,679 --> 01:41:45,681
- Tom, you coming?
- No.

1075
01:41:45,782 --> 01:41:48,685
I think Spanish Fort

1076
01:41:48,784 --> 01:41:51,121
is a place that needs
some looking after.

1077
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:55,091
Well,
if anybody ever says

1078
01:41:55,192 --> 01:41:57,661
Tom Pinkerton's a coward,

1079
01:41:57,761 --> 01:42:00,880
- you just send them my way.
- Thanks.

1080
01:42:02,649 --> 01:42:04,484
Come on, Jake.

1081
01:42:10,557 --> 01:42:11,858
Hey, Charlie!

1082
01:42:14,162 --> 01:42:17,596
I got my boots unstuck!

1083
01:42:19,466 --> 01:42:21,466
You crazy.

1084
01:42:24,271 --> 01:42:27,157
You gentlemen are making a mistake.

1085
01:42:27,256 --> 01:42:31,243
No, Your Honor,
you made the mistake.

1086
01:42:33,747 --> 01:42:36,399
Good people of Fort Smith?

1087
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:38,801
Gather the paper writers!

1088
01:42:38,902 --> 01:42:42,271
Charlie Storm and Bass Reeves

1089
01:42:42,372 --> 01:42:45,158
have returned with the bounty!

1090
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:49,345
Y'all ain't gonna believe this.

1091
01:42:49,445 --> 01:42:51,515
None of you said
we could do it, did you?

1092
01:42:51,614 --> 01:42:54,685
We done brought back an outlaw

1093
01:42:54,784 --> 01:42:57,587
that has killed many lawmen,

1094
01:42:57,688 --> 01:43:01,257
innocent people, and others.

1095
01:43:01,358 --> 01:43:04,243
We done brought back
Bob Dozier!

1096
01:43:10,251 --> 01:43:13,203
Nellie, Bass is back!

1097
01:43:13,302 --> 01:43:15,654
They killed Dozier!

1098
01:43:56,997 --> 01:43:59,398
I thought you was dead.

1099
01:44:09,310 --> 01:44:11,795
I've been thinking about my obit.

1100
01:44:11,895 --> 01:44:14,497
Oh, not this again.

1101
01:44:14,597 --> 01:44:16,399
You are no longer an outlaw.

1102
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:19,235
That's my point.

1103
01:44:19,336 --> 01:44:21,738
What's a good obit for a lawman?

1104
01:44:21,837 --> 01:44:23,855
Bass Reeves!

1105
01:44:25,792 --> 01:44:28,426
For some reason...

1106
01:44:29,631 --> 01:44:31,614
I think you gonna
have plenty of time.

1107
01:44:31,715 --> 01:44:33,617
Well, you know.
you can't be too careful.

1108
01:44:33,716 --> 01:44:35,667
Gentlemen.

1109
01:44:52,587 --> 01:44:56,689
Mr. Reeves,
you may enter the bar.

1110
01:44:58,292 --> 01:45:00,377
Here and in any court I preside in

1111
01:45:00,476 --> 01:45:02,662
as long as there's breath in my body.

1112
01:45:03,930 --> 01:45:07,033
Please, sir,
come forward.

1113
01:45:26,787 --> 01:45:28,872
You have something
for us, Judge?

1114
01:45:28,971 --> 01:45:31,440
I have a stack of
warrants for you.

1115
01:45:31,541 --> 01:45:34,092
- No less than 3,000.
- Ma'am.

1116
01:45:37,431 --> 01:45:40,765
Oh, and, Mr. Reeves,
I think you'll need this.

1117
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:22,574
Will you gentlemen be
needing any additional help?
