1
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,620
抱歉 抱歉 路上堵车了
Sorry, there was traffic jam.

2
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,160
最讨厌早班了
I hate the morning shift.

3
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,660
他们吐得到处都是
There was always vomit everywhere.

4
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,080
就像前几天在七子通公园厕所一样…
Like the other day at Nanago Dori Park...

5
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,290
就在涩谷的幡谷
...in Hatagaya.

6
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,120
真是太可怕了
It was truly terrible.

7
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,830
还有个昏迷很久的人
There is someone who has been out for a long time.

8
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,370
太恐怖了 十分可以打八分
The horror level is 8 out of 10!

9
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,950
你在听我说话吗
Are you listening to me?

10
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,580
不用麻烦了 桧山先生 反正没过多久还是会变脏
No need to bother, Mr. Hiyarama. It'll get dirty again later.

11
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,410
妈妈
Mom!

12
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,490
怎么了
What is it?

13
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,240
是妈妈带你过来的吗
Are you here with your mother?

14
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,040
不会有事儿的
Everything will be fine.

15
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,290
仗助
Josuke?

16
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,120
妈妈正在找你呢
Mom is looking for you!

17
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,290
你是什么人啊
Where are you from?

18
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,370
妈妈在到处找你呢
Mom is looking for you everywhere!

19
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,700
我不是跟你说不要走得太远吗
Didn't Mom say not to go too far?

20
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,370
我在公园里到处找你呢
Mom is looking all over the park.

21
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,410
对不起 妈妈 
I'm sorry Mom, dear.

22
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,660
现在弟弟也哭了
Now he was crying too.

23
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,040
对不起 妈妈
I'm sorry mom.

24
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,290
现在好了
Now it's fine.

25
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,990
这要怎么用
How does this work?

26
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,200
谢谢
Thank you very much.

27
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,450
你好 欢迎光临
Hello, welcome.

28
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,950
欢迎
Welcome back!

29
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,790
犒劳一下你
For your hard work!

30
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,870
太好了 他打中了
Yes! He hit the ball!

31
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,830
是吧 没错吧
He's in, right?

32
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,830
你看到了没
He's in! Did you see?

33
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,080
嘿 你干嘛
Hey, what are you doing?

34
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:50,620
打赌吗 这有什么好玩儿的
Playing bets? Where's the fun?

35
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,410
凯酱 退后
Kat-chan! Back off!

36
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:58,160
你要尊重别人支持的队伍或者是宗教什么的 来击个掌
Always respect other people's sports teams or religions. High five!

37
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,540
现在回去吧
Now go away. All right.

38
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,620
他们作弊了
They cheated.

39
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,120
他们把其他队里厉害的球手挖走了
They steal great players from other teams.

40
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,490
天啊
Good grief!

41
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,450
绫 你来啦
Aya! You come!

42
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,870
百分之百的惊喜
What a surprise! The rating is 10 out of 10!

43
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,040
稍等 还剩最后一个地方了
Wait a moment! This is the last place.

44
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,950
马上就结束了
I'm about to finish!

45
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,120
看来你还是能很有效率地工作呀
Turns out you can work fast.

46
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,830
有个女孩在等我呢 我要下班了
There's a girl waiting for me. I'm done for today.

47
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,120
快点
Come on!

48
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,370
桧山先生 你的车能借我用一下吗
Mr Hiyarama, may I borrow your car?

49
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:16,080
拜托了 我可不能错过今天晚上的机会
I can't miss this opportunity tonight. Mr. Hiyarama, please!

50
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,740
求你了
I beg you.

51
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,200
拜托
Come on, please.

52
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,910
这是我的前辈 桧山先生
This is Mr. Hiyarama, my senior at work.

53
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:36,330
认真勤勉 而且还很安静
Hard worker, but very quiet.

54
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:39,330
可没有人这么说过我
I don't even know what it sounds like.

55
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,330
桧山先生 这是绫
Mr. Hiyarama, this is Aya.

56
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,700
绝对的满分女孩
Definitely a 10 out of 10!

57
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,490
别这么说了
Stop saying that.

58
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,200
这个还能放吗
Can this be done?

59
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,240
桧山先生...
Pak Hiyarama..

60
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,080
我喜欢这个声音
I like the sound.

61
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,490
是吗
Time?

62
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,540
史密斯
Smith?

63
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,540
很常见的名字
Very common name.

64
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,580
桧山先生...
Pak Hiyarama,...

65
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,290
…你真的喜欢这份工作吗
...do you really like this job?

66
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,040
你甚至有自己的设备和工具
You have your own equipment and tools.

67
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,120
这种工作你为什么还要这么努力呢
How can you work so hard at a job like this?

68
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:14,160
不必回答我
You don't have to answer it.

69
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,160
我只是好奇
I'm just curious.

70
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,040
这个人很奇怪
This person is strange.

71
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,660
满分十分可以打九分
The scale is oddly 9 out of 10.

72
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,580
我喜欢盒式磁带的声音
I like the sound of cassette recordings.

73
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,870
是的 卡带的声音听起来很棒
Yes! The cassette sounds great!

74
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,950
这是我第一次听
This is my first time listening to it.

75
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,040
第一次总是最好的
The first time is always good!

76
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,700
在那儿把我放下
Drop me off there.

77
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,490
我们不是在约会吗
Aren't we on a date?

78
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,990
酒吧要加班
I have an extra shift at the bar.

79
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,410
你来的话 我可以陪你一晚上
If you come, I'll be with you all night.

80
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,950
我还没发工资呢
I'm still waiting for my salary.

81
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:32,830
桧山先生 这对我来说非常重要
Mr. Hiyarama, this is very important to me.

82
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,950
人没钱的话还谈什么恋爱啊
People can't fall in love without money.

83
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:43,870
这个世界到底怎么了
What happened to this world?

84
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,160
这就是现代吗
Is this the modern era?

85
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,370
这个值多少钱啊
What is the price for this?

86
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,910
你不想知道吗
Don't you want to know?

87
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,990
我只是好奇
I'm just curious!

88
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,990
这些东西又流行起来了 没准儿这些很值钱呢
Analog is back in trend. All of this may be of great value.

89
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:11,580
我真的只是好奇而已 我知道下北有一个估价地地方
I'm really just curious! I know a suitable place in Shimokita.

90
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,330
我不去
I didn't go there.

91
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,700
都用不上三十分钟
It only takes less than 30 minutes.

92
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,040
应该就在这里的...
It should be here...

93
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,370
就在这里 看到了吧
Here, that's the sign.

94
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,620
借过
Excuse me.

95
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,580
请问 这个现在值多少
Excuse me, how much is the selling price for this?

96
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,990
卢·里德的磁带很少见啊
This one is rare, it's Lou Reed.

97
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:50,950
这个的话值12000日元
For this, 12 thousand yen.

98
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,200
真的吗

00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:57,620
- 这个值8000  - 真的吗
- For this 8000.   - Really?

100
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,540
这些磁带你是从哪儿弄到的
Where did you get these tapes?

101
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,950
都是我的前辈的
They belong to my seniors.

102
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,910
这个得有4000日元
This one is 4000 yen.

103
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,790
这盘差不多6000 你手里的这些值很多钱呢
This one can be sold for 6000. You can make a lot of money from all this.

104
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,240
这还只是估计
This is my estimate.

105
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,660
我的天啊
My goodness!

106
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,290
桧山先生 我们把这些都卖掉吧
Extraordinary! Mr. Hiyarama, let's sell all of this!

107
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:26,080
谁的我们都要 现在这个很流行
We accept everything. Cassettes are trending.

108
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:28,540
尤其是七八十年代的磁带
Especially cassettes from the 70s and 80s.

109
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,740
我们把你的收藏都卖了吧
We have to sell it, your entire collection.

110
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,240
光是这盘就值12000
Twelve thousand just for this tape!

111
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,700
现在正是时候
Now is the perfect time!

112
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,700
一个 就卖一个也行
OK, just one. We'll just sell one.

113
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:43,040
然后我就可以去酒吧见绫了 今晚对我真的很重要
Then I can go to the bar to meet Aya. This is a very important night for me.

114
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
真的很重要
This is a very important night for me!

115
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,830
如果我错过这个机会...
If I miss this opportunity...

116
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:00,330
没有钱还哪有什么爱情生活 是吧
No love life if we're broke? Is that so?

117
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:43,540
非常感谢
Thank you very much!

118
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,580
恩人 我先走了

谢谢你
Thank You!

122
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,290
桧山先生...
Pak Hiyarama..

123
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:15,910
我觉得我跟绫不会在一起了 大概只有两成的机会
I don't think it's possible for me to be with Aya. Chances are 2 out of 10.

124
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,870
但是我不会放弃的放弃
But that doesn't mean I give up.

125
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:36,330
桧山先生...
Pak Hiyarama..

126
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:38,450
你还没结婚吧
You're not married yet, right?

127
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,240
你这个年纪还一个人
Alone at your age..

128
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,580
不会觉得孤独吗
Don't you ever feel lonely?

129
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,120
高志
Takashi!

130
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:53,700

It's you!

131

How are you?

134
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:04,870
我在找你呢
I am looking for you.

135
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,990
- 真的吗  - 是啊

每次见面都会握住
Every time he meets me, he holds it.

139
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:21,740
而且不管我到哪里 他总是能找到我
He always finds me. 10 out of 10.

140
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,200
他喜欢我的耳朵 ...
Dera-chan likes my ears,...

141
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:28,950
我都要变成什么挂件了
...and I'm just the accessory, right?

142
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:31,120
