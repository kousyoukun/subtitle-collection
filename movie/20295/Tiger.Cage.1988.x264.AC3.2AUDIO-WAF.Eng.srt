1
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,879
Faster!

2
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,565
Give me a bag

3
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,285
Big Brother

4
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,969
The real thing, so it's lived up is name

5
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,565
Heroine can be had in any quantity

6
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,640
They say you've a way in NY.

7
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,009
Let's combine.

8
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,888
To snatch your heroine business from them

9
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,564
Okay, it's mutually beneficial

10
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,928
Now I want 20 kilos of that stuff

11
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,086
Where's the money?

12
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,361
Here. Mind you.

13
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,439
Don't talk nonsense in front of Mr Big Brother

14
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,047
Trying to draw? Are you looking for hell?

15
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,763
Great! If you work with me

16
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,927
the other families will go bust

17
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,243
He's my brother.

18
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,206
Get 20 kgs of stuff for him

19
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,241
You bustard Ping!

20
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,325
Don't move, CID!

21
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,558
Don't move!

22
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,123
Don't move! Police, drop your gun!

23
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,126
Damn it!

24
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,719
Drop your gun!

25
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,610
Big brother, run!

26
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,405
Stay where you are!

27
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,964
Drop your gun and climb up slowly

28
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:09,608
No monkey bsiness! My gun has no eyes

29
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,089
Put your hands on your ears!

30
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,125
I never flop in any mission!

31
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,645
Damn you!

32
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,205
Are you alright, Uncle Te?

33
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,689
Yes

34
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,368
Well, an experienced fireman
gets his fingers hurt?

35
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,686
Nonsense!

36
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:23,885
Trying to run?

37
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,598
Stop, police

38
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,640
Keep away!

39
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,850
Drop your gun! Drop or I'll kill her!

40
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,041
Come on, put it down! Hear me?

41
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,885
Drop it or I'll shoot her dead

42
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,239
Outrageous! You scum

43
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,280
Are you sick of living?

44
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,280
Get back in!

45
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,726
Keep down

46
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,365
Are you fed up with living?

47
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,080
After him!

48
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,241
Shirley, don't come up! It's dangerous!

49
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,962
- Get the frogmen to salvage
- Yes, sir!

50
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,799
Did you mean to get killed?

51
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:07,761
Sorry!

52
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:24,806
Mr Huang

53
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,929
Cordon off the spot & call an ambulance

54
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,840
Yes, sir!

55
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:34,845
Mr Huang...

56
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,245
Thank you all for the trouble

57
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:38,566
I nearly forgot to get back

58
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,208
a bait for Shirley

59
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,763
Uncle Te, see how much our haul is

60
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:45,885
Yes, sir

61
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:51,238
Hsiu, here you are, fixed

62
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,126
Good

63
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,246
Mr Wei

64
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,118
Here's a file from the USA

65
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,842
This new drug syndicate...

66
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:11,920
is now in HK

67
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,080
Watch their movements

68
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,045
- Let's celebrate
- Drink more

69
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,762
Cheers!

70
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,728
- Don't...
- No more,please

71
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,925
- Really can't drink
- What...

72
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,444
- You're lying
- Enough

73
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,083
Well, I'll drink more tomorrow

74
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,000
Let's talk about it tomorrow

75
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:30,526
Listen

76
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,483
anyone making trouble tomorrow
will be transferred to Shataukok

77
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,927
Are you trying to avenge a personal grudge

78
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:36,885
What do you mean?

79
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,888
Mr Huang judge for us

80
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,325
We celebrated for him
because we took him for a friend

81
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,884
He's not taking us for friends.

82
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:43,720
What do you think?

83
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,926
Help me, or I'll get drunk for sure

84
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,119
Okay

85
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:54,086
You're getting married tomorrow. Drink this

86
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:55,925
Or Shirley has to clean the house for me

87
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,762
Right, Shirley will stay to clear up the rubbish

88
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,123
Don't think it's easy to be a housewife

89
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,440
Do you want him to drink. I don't

90
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,042
- Well?
- Drink it

91
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,365
Don't drink

92
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,123
Drink this big glass

93
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,369
Don't side with him so soon

94
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,565
We bachelors really...

95
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,368
envy your true feeling

96
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,442
You're lucky, you're quitting tomorrow

97
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,009
But we really are depressed

98
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,805
Why fight?

99
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,041
Only yesterday the doctor said my heart's weak

100
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:27,687
What?

101
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,759
I can't stand the shock

102
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,281
Sometimes you can't take a doctor
advice too serious

103
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,407
Sister, he can't stand the shock. Can you?

104
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,887
You don't drink this, you must clean the house

105
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,722
Go and collect the ashes

106
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,602
Drinking's bad for health.
What about venting our feelings?

107
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,846
That suits me better. I'm a virgin

108
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,841
I've lots of grievances, lets vent them

109
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,640
Ah Yu, come here!

110
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:50,840
What's it, Hsiu?

111
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:51,806
What's wrong with you?

112
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:52,965
Fix him for me

113
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,360
Is that an order or a friendly request?

114
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,845
Only a friend would tell you to do this

115
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,006
Yes, sir

116
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,163
No peeping and no moving of lower jaws

117
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,401
Anyone blowing the egg to an opponent win

118
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:13,925
Ready!

119
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:15,726
Ready!

120
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:19,966
Start!

121
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,202
Hsiu, I'm on your side. Why tease me?

122
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,918
Either we play today or never

123
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:42,800
Even if you...

124
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,200
were my master, I'd tease you.

125
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,889
Amy...

126
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,565
Terrific!

127
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,320
Make fun of mel?

128
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,484
Stop that. Amy really is coming

129
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,039
I don't care about her

130
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,726
- So what?
- It's you who don't care about me

131
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,486
Everything alright?

132
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,241
Amy

133
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,326
What?

134
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,802
How dare you lay hands on my girl?

135
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,648
- Protect me, Madam
- Don't go

136
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,400
Forget it!

137
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,600
Outrageous!

138
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,519
Bastard, how dare you?

139
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,402
Anyone teasing Amy will get it

140
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,842
He's flaring up

141
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:24,920
What's the matter with you?

142
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:25,840
It's alright

143
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,244
They're always so wild.

144
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,160
Never mind them

145
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:38,879
- Mr Huang, stop him
- Your guys...

146
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:39,640
What're you up to again?

147
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,719
That bastard hit me

148
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,129
Don't go so wild, will you?

149
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,089
Mr Huang, now is the Happy Hour

150
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,320
We'll go on even if Madam ordered us to stop

151
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,483
Dare you even to tease me?

152
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,845
Sorry, sir. We'll go down to accompany you

153
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,520
Good, you dared to fling me down

154
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,246
Come in!

155
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,445
It really got into my head

156
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,958
Get me a cup of coffee, will you?

157
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,645
Thank you

158
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,408
For me?

159
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,568
I planned to give it to Shirley

160
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,845
Now I think it suits you better

161
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,403
It depends

162
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,969
How could it suit me?

163
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,963
Not for tonight

164
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,842
As of tomorrow

165
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,966
you're to work like a slave

166
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,729
You tease me last time

167
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,600
Well have some tear-gas

168
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,200
So you'll cry on your wedding day

169
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,761
Don't exaggerate

170
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,844
Okay, you win

171
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,560
Make way

172
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,047
Let me

173
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,927
No, you're clumsy

174
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,279
So mush the better

175
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,042
Let me taste this nice cup of coffee

176
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,959
Your heart's weak. Don't drink coffee anymore

177
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,650
I only meant to fool them

178
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,562
You've fooled me too

179
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,845
No

180
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,889
Stop lying, tell me the truth

181
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,284
Do you love Shirley?

182
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,925
If you don't say it, it means you don't

183
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,808
No, but...

184
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,165
I still can't make up my mind
after such a long time

185
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,839
I love her then

186
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,042
You're not sincere

187
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,563
- They're pushing
- Go now

188
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,326
I'll go then

189
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,479
- Bye-bye
- Bye-bye

190
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,441
Really heartless, idiot

191
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,529
Take it off first

192
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:44,600
Right

193
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,408
Remember to collect the bride at 10 tomorrow

194
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,924
Wear a necktie

195
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,285
Thank you. Bye-bye

196
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,322
Try it at once

197
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,760
Really beautiful

198
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,764
The flower on the head is beautiful

199
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,839
Hsiu

200
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:24,886
Don't run

201
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,809
Call an ambulance at once!

202
00:19:59,050 --> 00:19:59,926
Hsiu

203
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:09,039
Shir...Shirley, I...

204
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,242
Hsiu...

205
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,486
What happened...

206
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,126
C.I.D.

207
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,528
Heavenly Father of all men

208
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,319
We pray especially for those we love

209
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,639
but can't see any more

210
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,082
May you bless them

211
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,445
& shine on them

212
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:10,525
May thy love, wisdom & omnipotence

213
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,886
Be demonstrated...

214
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,640
in them

215
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:20,280
We pray in jesus' name, Amen

216
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,488
Why are you back from your leave?

217
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,649
There's no point in taking leave now

218
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,209
Michael, I'm applying for return to duty

219
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,329
Good. Work may do you good

220
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,639
Master. I'm in trouble. You must help

221
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,847
You made things so bad.

222
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,921
Who'd help you?

223
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:10,480
Here's a potion of American ginseng.

224
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,203
See if it will help

225
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,164
Don't move. Police

226
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,284
Yu, handcuff him

227
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,280
Don't move!

228
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,245
Where's Swatow Hsiung?

229
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,123
I don't know. Miss

230
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,562
I don't know...

231
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,364
I really don't know

232
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,965
You're his best friend! Speak up!

233
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:13,646
Speak up!

234
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,960
Are you going to speak or not?

235
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,483
Maybe these 2 monsters...

236
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,685
may speak

237
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,886
- Sorry, I don't know anything
- Let's go

238
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,365
Don't, Mr Big

239
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:36,840
Go over there!

240
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,648
Don't scare madam

241
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,487
Be smart and speak

242
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,286
I really don't know

243
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:44,722
Don't blame me...

244
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,368
if your bottom gets burnt

245
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,200
Hear that?

246
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,519
I really don't know

247
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,606
Well, are you going to speak or not

248
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,481
Speak up!

249
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:52,760
Take off has pants!

250
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:54,685
Take off has pants!

251
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,965
You're not speaking? Scald him

252
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,045
Good

253
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:02,123
I enjoy doing it.

254
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,563
You don't care a damn about me

255
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:08,242
Speak up!

256
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,086
No?

257
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,646
No?

258
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,686
He's collapsed

259
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,205
His bottom's got burnt

260
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,723
That one outside may last longer

261
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,165
Okay, scald him

262
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,000
Take off your pants

263
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,526
I'll speak... I only know he's sailing tomorrow

264
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,804
But I don't know...

265
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,204
where

266
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:45,000
Keep away...

267
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,123
Look, we've got so many complaint

268
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,361
You took action without my approval

269
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,327
Used violence to hurt suspects.

270
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,400
How can I protect you

271
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,204
Inspector Ho Shih-ling, you've let me down

272
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,406
Sorry, sir

273
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,566
What good to say sorry now?

274
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:00,999
How long have you been in the police force?

275
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,319
With your relationship with Hsiu

276
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,127
you shouldn't handle this case

277
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,769
We're legally...

278
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,204
still unmarried

279
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:07,960
Shut up!

280
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,002
To talk about law

281
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,602
we'll all die martyrs

282
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,489
Vengeance makes us...

283
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,044
no different from rascal

284
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,929
You're unfit to be a policeman

285
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,761
Sorry, sir, Insp Ho's operation...

286
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,125
got my verbal approval

287
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,759
I know the whole thing well

288
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,399
Don't cover her up

289
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,888
I only feel that I've a responsibility

290
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:34,368
Good fix it then

291
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,359
If anything goes wrong again, mind your future

292
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:38,646
Yes, sir

293
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,049
I don't mind bearing the blame for you

294
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,920
But remember foolhardiness doesn't always work

295
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,285
- Mr Wang!
- Uncle Te, how's it?

296
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:02,927
We've a glue

297
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,206
Swatow Hsiung will leave HK

298
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,165
at Sam Mun Pier at two

299
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,881
Buddy, when will the ship sail?

300
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,323
After these drums have been moved

301
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:26,839
Swatow Hsiung

302
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,208
Don't move! Sail quickly!

303
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,603
Sail, or I'll shoot you dead

304
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,005
Release the rope

305
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,442
Brother, don't shoot, it's loaded with gasoline

306
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,441
My whole family's on it.

307
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,405
Don't shoot. I beg you.

308
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,529
Release the rope, faster!

309
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:21,880
Go to hell!

310
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:39,680
Don't move!

311
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,524
You're violating the law

312
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,926
Tai-li, tell the bastard
to bring the boat back to shore

313
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,446
Yu, keep the evidence on the spot
and bring it back

314
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,686
Yes, Mr Wong

315
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,480
Captain, show me your licence and I.D.

316
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:02,320
Not my fault, sir

317
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,082
Back to the shore.

318
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,523
We'll take your statement then

319
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:09,766
I wanted to kill him too

320
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,086
No more

321
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,959
We're police

322
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,559
What are you doing?

323
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,203
Old Te. I know the American ginseng case

324
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:31,768
Give me a chance. It's for everyone's good

325
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,965
Save your nonsense for the Tomb Festival

326
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,439
Mr Hueng...

327
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,485
Fix all these

328
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,161
Mr Heung, do you know the American ginseng case?

329
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,126
Mr Heung

330
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,489
Be smart & let me go

331
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,081
or we'll both perish

332
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:59,683
Kill me! See how you'll...

333
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,086
make your report

334
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,282
Get away...

335
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,930
- A snatcher...
- Don't move

336
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:14,726
Go and see him

337
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,126
Over here, you stay to watch him

338
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,286
Yes, Madam

339
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,083
Come here! Come here to mark the seat

340
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:21,840
Stop the others from coming

341
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,363
Old Te, you need this gun...

342
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,083
for evidence

343
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,282
Oh. I forgot

344
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:29,480
He was stunned

345
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:33,483
This coffee came from my friend in Brazil

346
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,327
Try it

347
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:34,967
Thank you, sir

348
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,446
I've read the report on yesterday's incidence

349
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:42,521
Mr Wei

350
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,168
We got no full marks

351
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,519
but I'm satisfied with the result

352
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,445
Had we captured on alive

353
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,204
we could get more clues

354
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,604
I like you...

355
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,601
for your serious attitude

356
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,883
You're already so busy. Take 2 days' leave

357
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,000
Thank you, sir

358
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,203
A fish has swallowed the bait.

359
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:20,885
Go & see

360
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:23,806
A big fish

361
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,449
Even you've caught it, must be a stupid fish

362
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,359
So you're stupider!

363
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:32,679
Get it back right away

364
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:33,726
Over there! Catch it, get it back

365
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,083
Take care

366
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:42,365
I've seen it. So it's a crafty fish

367
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:44,841
Is it?

368
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:45,760
There's no lack of stupid fish.

369
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:46,725
Let's catch

370
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:56,129
I daren't convey anything to you

371
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,280
Let's me teach you yatching.

372
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,882
Some day we'll cross the Pacific

373
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,369
Come!

374
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,318
No...

375
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,879
Turn...

376
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:19,800
Which way

377
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:20,800
This way?

378
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,289
Right. Turn

379
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:28,640
I did it

380
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:39,806
Uncle Te

381
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:43,286
Spend more time on Amy...

382
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,883
to strengthen the ties

383
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,209
I wish I could

384
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,044
But I'm a policeman

385
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:51,806
Excuse me

386
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:52,765
Okay! Bye-bye

387
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:56,767
This is Yu

388
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:57,762
What happened?

389
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,528
Mr. Hueng. I've caught Uncle Te...

390
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,963
dealing drug with foreigner

391
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,001
Impossible

392
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,730
It's true. I've the video tape for evidence

393
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,240
Let's make immediate action. What do you suggest?

394
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,082
No, it could be complicated

395
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:12,524
Bring all the tapes to the station for me to see

396
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,206
Anything important?

397
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,926
Nothing serious. I'll take you home

398
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:18,640
Let's go

399
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,560
Cindy wants me to remind you...

400
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:26,923
today is Amy birthday

401
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,002
I know. I know.

402
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,441
See the cake & flowers is ready.

403
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,963
Go & be pardon.

404
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:37,479
What are you waiting for! Get in!

405
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:40,887
Girls have to be soothed

406
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:50,685
Go now. Amy will be off duty soon

407
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,085
You're meddlesome

408
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,002
Only 1 5 minutes for fooling around

409
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,526
Thank you

410
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:06,920
Thank you

411
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:16,640
Amy

412
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,887
Can I help you, sir?

413
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:22,522
Yes.

414
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:25,045
I want 2 tickets for a trip with my girlfriend

415
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,608
It's her birthday. Happy birthday!

416
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,358
It's yours.

417
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:46,885
What's it on the tape? Let me show it

418
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,402
What are you going to cook for me?

419
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,122
Let's eat cakes after dinner

420
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,968
Don't touch my videotape recorder! Open the door

421
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,279
- Open up!
- What are you doing?

422
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,359
It's none of your business

423
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,405
Come out...

424
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,079
Who told you to watch my videotape

425
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:25,923
Well, you're keeping such a serious thing from me

426
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:26,641
What is it?

427
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,719
Are you taking me for your brother

428
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,403
Speak up...

429
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:32,481
Uncle Te's your master

430
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,288
but he's keeping it from you

431
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,042
It means he doesn't trust me

432
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,160
Who knows? You're taking him for your dad

433
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,444
How do I know you're an accessory?

434
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,405
Would I be an accessory to this?

435
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,402
I went through everything with you

436
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,764
and you suspect me?

437
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:56,209
You're so impulsive. How could I tell you?

438
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,122
It would only ruin you

439
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:59,723
What have you to fear now?

440
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:03,001
I'm not afraid either. Be he a tiger

441
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,763
Or my own dad.

442
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,000
I'll take him...

443
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:07,726
if he sells drug

444
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:09,045
I'll go & arrest him right now

445
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:11,727
Let's go!

446
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,561
Don't be so impulsive!

447
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,722
Any rash action will ruin everything

448
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:21,765
Aren't we brothers?

449
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:31,240
Listen

450
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:34,403
this is only between me & Mr Huang

451
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:35,447
And me

452
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:36,839
Yes...!

453
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,642
Remember, don't take individual action...

454
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:42,807
if you discover anything. Okay?

455
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,129
Bad. I must explain to Amy

456
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,320
Don't do anything foolish!

457
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,000
Listen

458
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:00,640
It hurts!

459
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:01,879
Go now, or I'll call the police

460
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,682
and accuse you of trespassing

461
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,005
You must be joking

462
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,086
Who's joking with you?

463
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:07,567
Amy

464
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,401
I won't see you anymore. Go away!

465
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,644
My hand!

466
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,923
You're not going? I will

467
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:18,720
What are you doing?

468
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:19,926
Don't go

469
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,000
Are you taking me for a criminal?

470
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,648
Yes. I sue you for willful damage

471
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,800
to a policeman's pride

472
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,165
I must question you now

473
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,525
I've followed you all the way

474
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,519
and kept saying 'sorry'

475
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,565
What else do you want?

476
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:32,523
Mr Fang. I want you to have some respect for me.

477
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:35,206
You come to see me when you're in the mood

478
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,082
You leave me behind

479
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,603
& say sorry when you're not

480
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:39,606
What are you taking me for?

481
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:40,919
My girlfriend

482
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,524
worthy of my respect

483
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:45,045
Have my action to show how important you're to me

484
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:47,089
I'll keep you company till tomorrow morning

485
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,043
I'll quit as a policeman. Okay?

486
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,081
No

487
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:52,526
I'll give you...

488
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:53,640
as a citizen to go out

489
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:57,199
I'll break with anyone else,
but I won't let you go

490
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:58,999
Let me go!

491
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,481
No, you mean everything to me

492
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,599
I can't cook if you don't let me go, jerk

493
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:08,643
Right, right, I must let you go

494
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,402
Let me see if you're hurt

495
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,527
A policeman gets more sentence
for indecent assault

496
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,362
I couldn't care less

497
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:45,965
Chun-yu, what are you up to? Come & help

498
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,967
I'm preparing a birthday gift for you

499
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,284
Come and eat

500
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:51,922
The big gift is here

501
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,365
Am I sweet?

502
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,365
Take me

503
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,519
Disgusting...

504
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,083
Shirley, have you got the key?

505
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,325
Yes

506
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,807
but Hsiu never allowed me to open it

507
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,608
And I don't know what it contains

508
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:42,365
Did you give him this?

509
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,967
He always kept everything to himself

510
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,565
Over $10 million! Impossible for a man

511
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:15,889
of his family background!

512
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:18,440
And these 2 passports! What are they for?

513
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,601
This must be ill-gotten money

514
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:25,843
These passports are to help use another identity

515
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:28,640
To get out of HK, in case of need

516
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,723
Wish my reasoning was wrong

517
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:35,444
I've recently got a tip-off that

518
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:36,522
Someone abused...

519
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,804
his power for dope-push

520
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,523
I thought...

521
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,324
he was honest

522
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:45,243
Shriley, I know how you feel

523
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,523
Please face up to reality

524
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:52,241
There's indeed something wrong with him

525
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,085
But I'll help you find out the truth

526
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:52,963
Buy a flag, sir...

527
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,642
Follow that white car in front

528
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:01,808
Royal HK policeman, no more police affair

529
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:03,729
No

530
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:06,085
I'm all yours tonight

531
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:16,885
GET LOST

532
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:11,560
Police

533
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:16,600
Drop your gun!

534
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:24,843
Drop your gun too, old Te

535
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:26,165
Terry, I...

536
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:28,798
Stay to speak to the judge. Fling it to see

537
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:36,486
Get your handcuffs & put them on

538
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,040
Those two foreigners

539
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,080
Terry

540
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,524
You're trafficking in drugs

541
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,681
As a policeman, you know the law and violate it

542
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:15,838
I was as hot-tempered when I was young

543
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,120
I understood

544
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:22,921
Why did you do that?

545
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,401
I've followed you since I left school

546
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:28,808
I took you for my master, my dad

547
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:31,760
But now it's all over between us

548
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:33,520
You're under arrest

549
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:35,880
Arrest me? I was braver than you

550
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:39,204
What did I get for arresting some small frys

551
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:41,244
2 lousy medals

552
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:44,123
When the weather's bad

553
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:45,529
it hurts & I can't sleep

554
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:48,843
They did it again once the got discharged

555
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:50,799
I am a small fry too

556
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:52,602
A small fry of a big shot

557
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:55,604
I don't care

558
00:46:55,890 --> 00:47:00,805
Terry, you're still young & you've your idea

559
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,441
When you reach...

560
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,209
my age & are

561
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:07,481
In my straitened circumstances.

562
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:10,847
You'll see how important money is

563
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:14,958
Shut up! Don't find an excuse for yourself

564
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:24,844
Terry, let me go

565
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:29,689
Sorry, Uncle Te

566
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:35,281
I know you're nice to me, but I've no choice

567
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:45,728
I caught Te dealing in drugs with...

568
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:48,086
2 foreigners in Stephen Bay, Stanley

569
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:40,726
Come on

570
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:29,085
Stop...!

571
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:34,725
Hey guy, move and you are death

572
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:41,127
Sir

573
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,281
these 2 foreigners dealt in drugs with Uncle Te

574
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:45,288
I've got the tape for evidence

575
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:48,086
Well done! You've done a great credit

576
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:50,006
Handcuff Uncle Te

577
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:51,720
Yes, sir

578
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:42,006
I'll fix everything with your boss. Leave now

579
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:44,846
Okay!

580
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:50,238
Why do you want to kill him?

581
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:51,519
You'll die for sure if he doesn't

582
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:56,809
I'd rather go to jail than to kill him

583
00:51:58,890 --> 00:51:59,720
You're my best aide.

584
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:00,799
I'll cover you up

585
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:04,285
I quit

586
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:07,402
Finish this case for me first

587
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:09,684
You know how to handle...

588
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:10,965
the things here

589
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:36,406
You gave me personal assurance that

590
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:40,404
Everything would be okay

591
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:43,443
Only about the stuff.

592
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:45,329
I'm not your nanny

593
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:48,088
I've overassessed you.

594
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:50,482
You can't even finish a kid

595
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:53,809
Now the co-operation is over between us

596
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:57,525
Our market in New York is so big

597
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:01,448
Many in HK would vie to be my sidekick

598
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:03,248
Okay, no problem

599
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:04,759
Listen

600
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:07,247
no one dare touch any deals I touched

601
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:11,479
Hong Kong is mine,
and you're not the only market in USA

602
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:13,283
Get out of HK & return to New York

603
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:17,364
Hold it, Michael!

604
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:20,610
I came here to make money, not to make enemy

605
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:23,440
Okay, I'll trust you one more time

606
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:26,840
Well, if you want co-operation,
do one thing for me

607
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:30,001
I want 200 kilos of stuff tomorrow night

608
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:33,324
This is my A No.

609
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:36,604
Credit the money into it
You'll get the stuff tomorrow night

610
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:56,245
The killer can never get away

611
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:59,169
We can get hold of him for sure

612
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:01,120
Morning!

613
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:04,838
What's wrong?
Why are you all wearing a stone face?

614
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:06,080
A bereavement?

615
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:09,679
- Ah Yu
- Ah Yu, come in!

616
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:13,167
Shirley, please go out for a while

617
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:19,128
Ah Yu, close the door please

618
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:26,599
I've ascertained Hsiu's drug-trafficking

619
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,081
Is that so? Does Shirley know it?

620
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:35,560
I'm not too sure

621
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:39,245
Would she be an accessory?

622
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:43,449
We must take more care from now on

623
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,763
I don't think Shirley has a hand on it

624
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:58,606
Here's a cassette of Te's drug-trafficking

625
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:05,848
It's of serious consequence

626
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:08,760
Formerly it was Hsiu, now It's Uncle Te

627
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:10,882
How many more are involved

628
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:11,766
I don't know

629
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:18,162
Yu, have you got any other evidence?

630
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:20,208
I've put a tape at Amy's

631
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:22,400
Is that so?

632
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:24,838
Don't worry.

633
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:25,999
Amy knows nothing about it

634
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:29,529
We must get it back as soon as possible

635
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:31,644
For Amy's safety

636
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,365
don't tell anyone about it

637
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:34,879
I know what to do

638
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:39,602
Shirley, please come in

639
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:46,283
Yu, I want to talk to you

640
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:49,798
Keep cool.

641
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:51,719
Something happened last night

642
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:52,760
What is it?

643
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:54,406
Come in

644
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:56,080
Mr Huang

645
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:59,409
Shirley

646
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:01,118
put this important item in a safe

647
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:07,802
Aren't you afraid she might be Te's accompany

648
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:10,800
Impossible

649
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:18,524
Terry was killed yesterday

650
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:19,606
What?

651
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:26,767
He knew about Old Te

652
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:36,240
I must go out for a while

653
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:41,000
Old Te, hold it! You creep!

654
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:45,130
You ruined Terry. I'll kill you!

655
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:46,086
Ah Yu

656
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:47,569
Are you crazy? Uncle Te's taking
Terry for his own son.

657
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,400
You're mistaken

658
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:52,444
Yu, don't get the wrong idea.

659
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:53,644
He won't do that

660
00:56:57,770 --> 00:56:58,520
What happened?

661
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:00,885
A policeman trafficking in drugs can do anything

662
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:04,440
Quiet! We're all friends. Let's talk it over

663
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:05,406
Let me go!

664
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:07,682
I've proof of your drug-trafficking

665
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:10,685
I've already reported to Mr Huang.
I'll testify against you

666
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:12,487
Yu, don't be impulsive

667
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,124
You did report to me

668
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:17,569
but I can't accuse Te

669
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:19,404
Before I see the evidence

670
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:21,044
I must be him

671
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,762
I've got tapes of your drug-trafficking

672
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:28,726
Nonsense

673
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:32,805
Shirley, run it for him

674
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:34,806
Run it

675
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:02,485
How come?

676
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:06,129
Obviously the cassette has been swapped

677
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:08,086
What? Where's the evidence?

678
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:10,800
You yourself are under suspicion

679
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:12,079
You're exposing your own crime

680
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:13,286
Last time Hsiu got killed

681
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:15,520
because you planted a smoke bomb

682
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:17,801
This time Terry got killed
because you abandoned your duty

683
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:18,806
What explanation can you give?

684
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:20,249
I have other evidence

685
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:23,882
I saw him putting heroin in...

686
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:25,323
I also saw you put heroin into the locker

687
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:27,202
Let's search together

688
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:30,840
I'm not afraid. You're finished. Give me the key

689
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:32,078
Don't try anything foolish

690
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:33,360
Keep away!

691
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:37,526
Uncle Te, the key!

692
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:39,126
Pheasant

693
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,239
Sorry, Uncle Te

694
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,407
Keep cool

695
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:57,163
Uncle Te, you really did it

696
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:00,326
You put aside my book & said it was missing

697
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:03,998
Will you search more thoroughly?

698
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:05,324
We've searched everything. There's nothing

699
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:09,607
- Let's search his home
- Ah Yu,

700
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:11,764
- your locker
- Open it and see

701
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:12,646
Okay

702
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:20,086
Search!

703
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:40,205
- You really did it
- No

704
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:41,439
Yu, calm down

705
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:43,999
Are you going to tell me this is flour?

706
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:45,125
This bag is not mine

707
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,564
It was frame-up

708
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:49,643
Believe up me, Shirley, believe me

709
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:51,083
Now I won't trust anyone

710
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:53,127
I only believe in truth and evidence

711
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:55,122
You're arrested for drug possession

712
00:59:57,370 --> 01:00:00,203
Shirley, I know Te is not alone in the

713
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:01,798
Frame-up. Soon I'll seek them out!

714
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:03,199
Watch out

715
01:00:03,490 --> 01:00:04,684
Do you mean us?

716
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:06,249
- Don't frame us
- Don't get us involved

717
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:07,809
- Because you're evil
- Quiet

718
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:09,484
This is not a market

719
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:12,203
You're the Discipline Unit

720
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:15,604
I'll investigate the accusation
between Yu & Uncle Te

721
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:18,445
You'll also be subject to internal investigation

722
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:25,366
I'm drug investigation Special Operation

723

Insp Ho

724
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,882
You're suspected of drug possession.
What's your name?

725
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:29,920

726
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:31,640

727
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:36,886
A member of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force

01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:40,321
With the Drug Investigation Dept
of the Special Operations

729
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:41,082
Where do you live?

730
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:43,005
You know it already

731
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:44,883
As a policeman, you should know...

732
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:46,209
I know better in this respect

733
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:47,565
I've discovered heroin in your locker

734
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:48,525
how do you explain that?

735
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:51,887
I was framed. Why should I explain?

736
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:55,049
Possess no drugs, why should I be question

737
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:57,360
There's no evidence to support your state

738
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:59,168
You mean you've proof against me?

739
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:01,600
Can you think of anything to prove your innocence?

740
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:03,324
Law requires evidence

741
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:05,487
All your statement may be used
as evidence in court

742
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:06,879
Okay, I'll give my statement

743
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:10,129
I deal in drugs, smuggling and

744
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:11,684
Resort to killing, arson and robbery

745
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:14,845
Take it down as a matter of routine! Come on

746
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:16,882
Evidence in Court? Take it down!

747
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:18,126
Ah Yu

748
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:21,242
My name is Shih Shun-yu, I don't know you

749
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:25,764
I suspect Insp Ho Hsueh-ling's
conspiracy against me

750
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:28,646
Take it down! Sue me

751
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:07,883
The time is 20th Oct 1988 at 3 p.m.

752
01:02:08,370 --> 01:02:10,122
I'm Anti-Narcotics Bureau detective

753
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:11,803
Fang Shun-yu No.3368

754
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:14,599
I suspect my Sergeant Feng Chien-te
of drug-trafficking

755
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:17,002
As a result of 3 days probe & trace

756
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:18,763
I've discovered him

757
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:19,919
dealing in drugs with...

758
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:21,921
2 unidentified foreigners on a ferry

759
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:23,759
deduced that he used his detective identity

760
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:25,886
to cover up

761
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:27,523
his trafficking activities

762
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:39,759
Mr Huang

763
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:40,680
Mr Huang?

764
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:44,519
I'm Old Te, I've searched the whole house

765
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:45,685
There are many cassettes

766
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:47,562
but not the one you mention

767
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:48,959
I'm back first

768
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:11,606
Any clues?

769
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:15,763
Go back & retire. I'll take charge here

770
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:24,600
Mr Huang

771
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:37,158
Ah Yu, I believe you are innocent

772
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:40,239
Mr Huang, you must help me on this

773
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:47,719
Who else knows

774
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:49,000
the old Te case besides me?

775
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:53,286
Terry

776
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:56,567
You know Terry is impulsive

777
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:59,485
Now you've ruined him & yourself

778
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:08,609
The first thing is to prove your innocence

779
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:11,242
Take me to get the copy

780
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:13,680
of cassette you mentioned

781
01:05:23,810 --> 01:05:24,799
Don't you trust me?

782
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:34,240
Shun-yu

783
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:35,805
Have you seen the cassette I taped yesterday?

784
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:36,606
Yes

785
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:38,842
Besides Te, there's...

786
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:41,763
Go on! Speak up!

787
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:45,286
I don't know, I don't know anything

788
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:46,644
Do you know or not?

789
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:48,409
I know nothing

790
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:58,162
That cassette is very important to Yu

791
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:00,361
Bring it if you know where it is

792
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:05,727
There's no such a cassette

793
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:06,561
There must be.

794
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:08,049
I ran it on this VTR recorder last night

795
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:08,846
Have you ever taken it away?

796
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:10,363
No, I didn't even touch it

797
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:11,764
Just now you said you got it

798
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:12,885
Without it

799
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:15,609
I can't clear myself. I'll be in jail

800
01:06:16,930 --> 01:06:18,443
Do you know it or don't you?

801
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:19,765
I know...

802
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:21,204
Take out now

803
01:06:21,330 --> 01:06:22,843
You don't want Yu to get into trouble

804
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:35,447
I promise

805
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:38,121
I'll quit once I'm cleared

806
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:55,960
I'm so scared!

807
01:06:56,970 --> 01:06:57,607
Why?

808
01:06:57,610 --> 01:06:58,929
It's okay if you find the cassette

809
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:01,240
Well, Yu, we must leave

810
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:03,726
Amy's going to be alright,
I'll have someone watch her

811
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,160
I'm Michael

812
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:11,647
now at 5 Conduit Garden 26th floor

813
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:14,400
Send someone, a woman needs protection

814
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:17,600
Yu, we're in a hurry

815
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:19,760
Excuse me

816
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:24,082
Shun Yu, I want no protection

817
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:26,645
I'm alright, I'll return soon

818
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,165
Bye-bye!

819
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:29,406
Let's go!

820
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:38,366
Please call Amy, 3368 urgent.

821
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:39,759
Tell her to call my home

822
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:46,521
Mr Huang, let's return to Hq

823
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:47,599
Handcuff me

824
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:50,563
Okay, this will save us
from unnecessary complaints

825
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:53,680
Bear with it now & soon you'll clear your's

826
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:05,003
Mr Huang, sorry for the trouble

827
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:06,525
Don't mention it

828
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:20,767
Mr Huang

829
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:22,408
it was these foreigners who deal with Te

830
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:24,521
Turn around and arrest them!

831
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:47,725
Amy, what happened?

832
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:50,365
Shirley, Michael masterminded...

833
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:52,362
Te's dope-pushing

834
01:08:52,610 --> 01:08:53,725
He won't do that

835
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:57,445
It's true. He just took that cassette away

836
01:08:57,650 --> 01:08:58,799
I'm scared

837
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,682
Keep calm, don't go away.

838
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:03,808
Tell me in detail

839
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:52,201
Michael masterminded Te's dope-pushing

840
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:55,089
Believe me...

841
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:47,159
Freeze

842
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:50,526
Come in!

843
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:54,928
Why are you coming to see me at this hour

844
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:04,000
You're depressed, don't drink so much

845
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:06,569
After so much has happened

846
01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:08,244
go for a pleasure tour

847
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:12,322
Amy spoke to me over the phone before her dead

848
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:14,000
Is that so?

849
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:16,926
What did she say to you?

850
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:18,682
Yu is innocent of drug possession

851
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:20,279
A big shot is behind

852
01:14:20,610 --> 01:14:21,565
Te's drug-trafficking

853
01:14:21,770 --> 01:14:22,566
Who?

854
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:24,809
You should know better

855
01:14:27,450 --> 01:14:28,803
You suspect me.

856
01:14:29,650 --> 01:14:31,049
Call the police to arrest

857
01:14:31,850 --> 01:14:33,647
I would have done it

858
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:35,285
But we're good friends

859
01:14:35,450 --> 01:14:37,486
But now you've a chance to give yourself up

860
01:14:37,730 --> 01:14:39,402
Can you testify against me like this?

861
01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:42,045
Yes, with my name & position in the police force

862
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:43,843
My words will convince everyone

863
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:46,161
Now listen, I Michael Wong am a drug-trafficking

864
01:14:46,370 --> 01:14:47,359
What have got anything to accuse me of it

865
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,127
I've a copy of Te's drug-trafficking tape

866
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:53,325
I've a copy too.

867
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:55,888
His crime is not linked with me

868
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:57,399
I can testify against you

869
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:05,803
Testify against me?

870
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:26,126
That tape

871
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:27,643
even if released to the world
won't serve any purpose

872
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:29,967
Because only Te can testify against me

873
01:15:32,490 --> 01:15:35,050
Vincent, yes, I'm Michael

874
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:36,645
Finish off Te right away

875
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:38,283
I'll hand the stuff over to you in person

876
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:46,882
We've been getting on well

877
01:15:47,530 --> 01:15:48,804
because you're obedient

878
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:51,078
But, unfortunately...

879
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:49,519
Mr Feng, telephone

880
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:50,560
Yes, speaking

881
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:52,567
The long distance call to Canada is connect

882
01:16:53,570 --> 01:16:54,207
Thank you

883
01:16:55,890 --> 01:16:57,209
Darling

884
01:16:57,330 --> 01:16:58,046
Daddy

885
01:16:58,370 --> 01:16:59,246
Yes

886
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:00,166
What is it?

887
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:02,488
I'll fly to Canada

888
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:04,003
at 7 tomorrow morning

889
01:17:04,530 --> 01:17:05,087
What?

890
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:08,328
The Hq has approved my early retirement

891
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:10,807
for health reasons

892
01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:13,282
Have you received my remittance?

893
01:17:34,330 --> 01:17:35,285
Don't move

894
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:48,480
Old Te...

895
01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:51,005
Old Te...

896
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:58,086
No monkey business!

897
01:18:18,450 --> 01:18:19,439
Hell with you!

898
01:19:57,930 --> 01:20:02,128
Damn, I'll kill you...

899
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:04,007
Kill...

900
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:05,885
Let's go

901
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:33,405
Have you found out everything?

902
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:35,926
This resignation letter has explained everything

903
01:20:36,530 --> 01:20:37,087
I'm extremely sorry

904
01:20:37,090 --> 01:20:39,160
I didn't discover

905
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:40,925
My subordinate's misbehavior till now

906
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:44,728
I ready for disciplinary action & investify

907
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:46,325
But I've a request

908
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:48,163
I wish I could arrest these men myself

909
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:49,959
I hope Mr Wei will give me this chance

910
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:52,209
before I leave

911
01:20:52,490 --> 01:20:54,242
Good, go ahead

912
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,045
Thank you, sir

913
01:20:57,050 --> 01:20:58,927
Ladies and gentleman

914
01:20:59,210 --> 01:21:01,644
we've ample evidence against

915
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:04,125

and detective Fang for drug-trafficking

917
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:06,565
I personally can't shirk the responsible
for this disgrace

918
01:21:07,690 --> 01:21:10,284
They're now fugitives with arms

919
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:12,369
We must bring them to book

920
01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:14,806
Please put personal feelings aside

921
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:18,208
Shoot anyone on sight who tries to resist

922
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:26,886
Bitch

923
01:22:29,730 --> 01:22:31,368
I've already done what you want.

924
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:32,798
What about the stuff?

925
01:22:33,130 --> 01:22:34,245
Let me finish off that bitch

926
01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:36,839
No. I'll fix her for you

927
01:22:37,210 --> 01:22:40,407
I'll take your life
if I can't get the cargo tonight

928
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:06,287
3388, yes

929
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:08,203
Fang & Te have got Michael's drug

930
01:25:08,330 --> 01:25:10,400
trafficking proof in Jackson Road

931
01:25:10,850 --> 01:25:11,646
Tell her to come at once

932
01:25:11,850 --> 01:25:13,169
Yes, thank you

933
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:35,959
All the cargo is in the car

934
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:49,481
Making fun of me? Damn you

935
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:53,526
Michael Huang

936
01:25:57,890 --> 01:26:02,122
Damn killing you with
I shot is too good for you

937
01:26:03,130 --> 01:26:05,200
I want you to be a limply in jail all your life

938
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:07,122
You're wanted. What have you got to arrest

939
01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:08,240
My will power

940

Even by going to jail
I must testify against you double dealer

Be flexible my gun's still with you

945
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:25,565
Get out!

946

Damn you double-crosser I'll kill you

947
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:43,884
I made much money for you

948
01:26:44,050 --> 01:26:45,244
and you got men to kill me?

949
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:46,758
I'll kill you double crosser

950

I must take your life

951

None can testify against me when you're dead

952
01:27:40,930 --> 01:27:41,919
Let's perish together

953
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:11,964
Scum, traitor, I'll kill you

954
01:30:21,050 --> 01:30:22,563

You're a drug trafficker

957

You lie

958
01:30:26,770 --> 01:30:28,203
Don't move let's talk it over in the headquarter

959
01:30:28,210 --> 01:30:29,086

960

964
01:30:43,570 --> 01:30:46,721
Michael, you're no chance. Give up

965
01:30:47,170 --> 01:30:49,047
With her in my hands

Drive the car over away

970
01:31:01,770 --> 01:31:02,600
Yes sir

971
01:31:32,930 --> 01:31:34,124
Hold it

972
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:35,161
Thank you.

973
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:37,401
Without your help I would have cracked this case

974
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:40,928
I'll make good the grievances you've suffered
