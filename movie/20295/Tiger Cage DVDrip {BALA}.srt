1
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,034
Faster!

2
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,075
Give me a bag.

3
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,350
Big Brother.

4
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,679
The real thing,
so it's lived up its name.

5
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,149
Heroine can be had in any quantity.

6
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,520
They say you've a way in NY.
Let's combine

7
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,278
to snatch your heroine businesses
from them.

8
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,590
Okay, it's mutually beneficial.

9
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,351
Now I want 20 kilos of that stuff.

10
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,390
Where's the money?

11
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,875
Here.

12
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,232
Mind you.

13
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,274
Don't talk nonsense
in front of Mr. Big Brother.

14
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,518
Trying to draw?
Are you looking for hell?

15
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,189
Great!

16
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,155
If you work with me,
the other families will go bust.

17
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,433
He's my brother.
Get 20 kgs of stuff for him.

18
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,589
You bastard Ping!

19
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,640
Don't move, CID!

20
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,550
Don't move!

21
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,793
Don't move! Police, drop your gun!

22
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,995
Damn it!

23
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,519
Drop your gun!

24
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,280
Big brother, run!

25
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,469
Stay where you are!

26
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,591
Drop your gun and get up slowly.

27
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,039
No monkey business! My gun has no eyes.

28
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,474
Put your hands on your ears!

29
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,313
I never flop in any mission!

30
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,595
Damn you!

31
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,595
Are you alright, Uncle Te?

32
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,954
Yes.

33
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,599
Well, an experienced fireman
gets his fingers hurt?

34
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,790
Nonsense!

35
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,235
Trying to run?

36
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,870
Get out of my way!

37
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,675
Stop, police.

38
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,835
Freeze!

39
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,909
Keep away!

40
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,113
Drop your gun! Drop or I'll kill her!

41
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,950
Come on, put it down! Hear me?

42
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,915
Drop it or I'll shoot her dead.

43
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,950
Drop it!

44
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,477
Outrageous! You scum.

45
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,718
Are you sick of living?

46
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,994
Keep down, police!

47
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,471
Are you fed up with living?

48
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,876
After him!

49
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,153
Shirley, don't come up! It's dangerous!

50
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,630
Get the frogmen to salvage.

51
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,596
Yes, sir!

52
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,434
Did you mean to get killed?

53
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,429
Sorry!

54
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,510
Mr.Huang

55
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,472
Cordon off the spot
and call an ambulance.

56
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,356
Yes, sir!

57
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,189
Mr.Huang...

58
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,549
Thank you all for the trouble.

59
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,278
I nearly forgot
to get back a bait for Shirley.

60
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,633
Uncle Te, see how much our haul is,

61
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,750
Yes, sir.

62
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,596
Hsiu, here you are, fixed.

63
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,590
Good.

64
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,230
Mr.Wei.

65
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,039
Here's a file from the USA.

66
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,517
This new drug syndicate

67
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,555
is now in HK.

68
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,595
Watch their movements.

69
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,429
Let's have more.

70
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,675
I've had enough.

71
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,875
Cheers!

72
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,838
Don't...
What?

73
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,229
Really can't drink.

74
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,640
You're lying.

75
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,595
Enough...

76
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,789
Well, I'll drink more tomorrow.

77
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,830
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

78
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,395
Listen,

79
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,988
anyone making trouble tomorrow
will be transferred to Shataukok.

80
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,839
Are you trying to avenge
a personal grudge.

81
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,234
What do you mean?

82
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,430
Mr.Huang judge for us.

83
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,596
We celebrated for him
because we took him for a friend.

84
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,513
He's not taking us for friends.
What do you think?

85
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,996
Help me, or I'll get drunk for sure.

86
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,115
Okay.

87
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,671
You're getting married tomorrow.
Drink this,

88
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,589
or Shirley has to clean the house for me.

89
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,273
Right, Shirley will stay
to clear up the rubbish.

90
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,668
Don't think it's easy to be a housewife.

91
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,195
Do you want him to drink. I don't.

92
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,433
Well?
Drink it.

93
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,589
Don't drink.

94
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,358
Drink this big glass.

95
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,393
Don't side with him so soon.

96
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,518
We bachelors...

97
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,437
really envy your true feeling.

98
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,273
You're lucky, you're quitting tomorrow.

99
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,589
But we really are depressed.

100
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,349
Why fight? Only yesterday
the doctor said my heart's weak.

101
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,316
What?

102
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,435
I can't stand the shock.

103
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,631
Sometimes you can't take
a doctor advice too serious.

104
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,593
Sister, he can't stand the shock.
Can you?

105
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,757
You don't drink this,
you must clean the house.

106
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,109
Go and collect the ashes.

107
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,392
Drinking's bad for health.
What about venting our feeling?

108
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,477
That suits me better. I'm a virgin.

109
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,551
I've lots of grievances, lets vent them.

110
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,435
Ah Yu, come here!

111
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,431
What's it, Hsiu?
What's wrong with you?

112
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,640
Fix him for me.

113
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,596
Is that an order or a friendly request?

114
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,955
Only a friend would tell you to do this.

115
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,389
Yes, sir.

116
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,352
No peeping and no moving
of lower jaws.

117
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,238
Anyone blowing the egg
to an opponent win.

118
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,474
Ready?

119
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,469
Ready?

120
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,229
Start!

121
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,752
Hsiu, I'm on your side. Why tease me?

122
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,235
Either we play today or never.

123
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,069
Even if you were my master,
I'd tease you.

124
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,032
Amy...

125
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,595
Terrific!

126
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,355
Make fun of me?

127
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,159
Stop that. Amy really is coming.

128
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,952
I don't care about her.
She really is coming.

129
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,836
So what?

130
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,115
It's you who don't care about me.

131
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,915
Everything alright?

132
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,348
Amy.
What?

133
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,319
How dare you lay hands on my girl?

134
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,198
Protect me.
Stop fooling around.

135
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,588
Forget it!

136
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,595
Outrageous!

137
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,635
Bastard!

138
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,393
How dare you?

139
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,232
Anyone teasing Amy will get it.

140
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,477
He's flaring up.

141
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
What's the matter with you?

142
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
It's alright.

143
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,676
They're always so wild.
Never mind them.

144
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,590
Mr.Huang, stop him.

145
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,715
What's you up to again?

146
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,716
That bastard hit me.

147
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,994
Don't go so wild, will you?

148
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,834
Mr.Huang, now is the Happy Hour.

149
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,110
We'll go on even if Madam
ordered us to stop.

150
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,112
Dare you even to tease me?

151
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:28,951
Sorry, sir.

152
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,229
We'll go down to accompany you.

153
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,589
Good, you dared to fling me down.

154
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,516
Come in!

155
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,629
It really got into my head.

156
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,713
Get me a cup of coffee, will you?

157
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,354
Thank you.

158
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,708
For me?

159
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,639
I planned to give it to Shirley.

160
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,831
Now I think it suits you better.

161
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,359
It depends.

162
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,592
How could it suit me?

163
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,598
Not for tonight.

164
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,518
As of tomorrow,
you need to love Shirley.

165
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,595
you're to work like a slave.

166
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,039
You tease me last time.

167
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,598
Well have some tear-gas.

168
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,075
So you'll cry on your wedding day.

169
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,311
Don't exaggerate.

170
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,109
Okay, you win.

171
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,475
Make way.

172
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,916
Let me.

173
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,838
No, you're clumsy.

174
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,149
So much the better.

175
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,599
Let me taste this nice cup of coffee.

176
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,588
Your heart's weak.
Don't drink coffee anymore.

177
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,074
I only meant to fool them.

178
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,799
You've fooled me too.

179
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,109
No.

180
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,119
Stop lying, tell me the truth.

181
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,474
Do you love Shirley?

182
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,915
If you don't say it, it means you don't.

183
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,593
No, but...

184
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,635
I still can't make up my mind
after such a long time.

185
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,309
I love her then.

186
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,512
You're not sincere.

187
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,278
Have you finished talking?

188
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,789
Go now, They're pushing.

189
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,274
I'll go then.

190
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,555
Bye-bye!

191
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,879
Really heartless, idiot.

192
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,959
Take it off first.

193
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,589
Right.

194
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,151
Remember to collect
the bride at 10 tomorrow.

195
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,594
Wear a necktie.

196
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,392
Thank you. Bye-bye.

197
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,595
Try it at once.

198
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,155
Really beautiful.

199
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,753
The flower on the head is beautiful.

200
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,630
Hsiu!

201
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,390
Don't run.

202
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,310
Hsiu!

203
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,159
Call an ambulance at once!

204
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,189
Hsiu...

205
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:31,274
Shir..Shirley, I...

206
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,914
Hsiu...

207
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,796
What happened...

208
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,796
C.I.D.

209
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,632
Heavenly Father of all men.

210
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,713
We pray especially for those we love

211
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,159
but can't see any more.

212
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,353
May you bless them and shine on them.

213
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,070
May the love, wisdom

214
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,640
and omnipotence,

215
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,076
be demonstrated in them.

216
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,198
We pray in Jesus' name, Amen.

217
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,118
Why are you back from your leave?

218
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,193
There's no point in taking leave now.

219
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,598
Michael, I'm applying for return to duty.

220
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,593
Good. Work may do you good.

221
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,909
Master. I'm in trouble. You must help.

222
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,798
You made things so bad.

223
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,871
Who'd help you?

224
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,316
Here's a potion of American ginseng.

225
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,714
See if it will help.

226
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,193
Don't move. Police.

227
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,398
Yu, handcuff him.

228
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,515
Don't move!

229
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,239
Where's Swatow Hsiung?

230
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,595
I don't know. Miss.

231
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,633
I don't know...

232
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,550
Speak up!

233
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,709
I really don't know.

234
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,189
You're his best friend! Speak up!

235
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,915
Speak up!

236
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,592
Are you going to speak or not?

237
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,356
Maybe these 2 monsters may speak.

238
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,039
Sorry, I don't know anything.

239
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,990
Let's go.

240
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,549
Don't, Mr.Big.

241
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,110
Go over there!

242
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,471
Don't scare madam.

243
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,873
Be smart and speak.

244
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,830
I really don't know.

245
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,678
Don't blame me
if your bottom gets burnt.

246
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,795
Hear that?

247
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,069
I really don't know.

248
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,708
Well, are you going to speak or not.
Speak up!

249
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,395
Take off your pants!

250
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,153
Take off your pants!

251
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,191
You're not speaking? Scald him.

252
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,190
Good.

253
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,519
I enjoy doing it.

254
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,589
You don't care a damn about me.

255
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,593
Speak up!

256
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,790
No?

257
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,558
No?

258
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,994
He's collapsed.

259
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,435
His bottom's got burnt.

260
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,272
That one outside may last longer.

261
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,429
Okay, scald him.
Give it to me.

262
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,829
Take off your pants.

263
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,117
I'll speak...
I only know he's sailing tomorrow,

264
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,680
but I don't know where.

265
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,240
Keep away...

266
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,517
Look, we've got so many complaint.

267
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,596
You took action without my approval,

268
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,633
used violence to hurt suspects.
How can I protect you.

269
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,154
lnspector Ho Hsueh-ling,
you've let me down.

270
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,516
Sorry, sir.

271
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,392
What good to say sorry now?

272
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,675
How long have you been
in the police force?

273
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,074
With your relationship with Hsiu,

274
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,792
you shouldn't handle this case.

275
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,479
We're legally...

276
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,595
still unmarried.

277
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,590
Shut up!

278
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,030
To talk about law, we'll all die martrs.

279
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,593
Vengeance makes us

280
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,512
no different from rascal.

281
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,993
You're unfit to be a policeman.

282
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,914
Sorry, sir.

283
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,152
Insp Ho's operation
got my verbal approval.

284
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,793
I know the whole thing well.

285
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,399
Don't cover her up.

286
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,596
I only feel that I've a responsibility.

287
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,912
Good fix it then.

288
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,755
If anything goes wrong again,
mind your future.

289
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,354
Yes, sir.

290
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,591
I don't mind bearing the blame for you.

291
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,154
But remember foolhardiness
doesn't always work.

292
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,474
Mr. Huang!
Uncle Te, how's it?

293
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,311
We've a glue.

294
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,430
Swatow Hsiung will leave HK

295
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,471
at Sam Mun Pier at two.

296
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,598
Buddy, when will the ship sail?

297
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,789
After these drums have been moved.

298
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,195
Swatow Hsiung.

299
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,232
Don't move! Sail quickly!

300
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,912
Sail, or I'll shoot you dead.

301
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,359
Release the rope.

302
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,640
Brother, don't shoot,
it's loaded with gasoline.

303
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,789
My whole family's on it.

304
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,513
Don't shoot. I beg you.

305
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,398
Release the rope, faster!

306
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,956
Go to hell!

307
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,750
Don't move!

308
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,599
You're violating the law.

309
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,711
Terry, tell the bastard to bring
the boat back to shore.

310
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,356
Yu, keep the evidence on the spot
and bring it back.

311
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,589
Yes, Mr.Huang.

312
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,678
Captain, show me your license and I.D.

313
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,675
Not my fault, sir.

314
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,313
Back to the shore.

315
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,595
We'll take your statement then.

316
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,150
I wanted to kill him too.

317
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,395
No more.

318
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,233
We're police.

319
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,035
What are you doing?

320
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,593
Old Te.
I know the American ginseng case.

321
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,638
Give me a chance.
It's for everyone's good.

322
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,875
Save your nonsense
for the Tomb Festival.

323
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,311
Mr.Huang...

324
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,475
Fix all these.

325
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,150
Mr.Huang, do you know
the American ginseng case?

326
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,869
Mr.Huang.

327
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,599
Be smart and let me go
or we'll both penrish.

328
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,479
Kill me!

329
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,029
See how you'll make your report.

330
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,231
Get away...

331
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,038
A snatcher...
Don't move!

332
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,549
Go and see him.

333
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,640
Over here, you stay to watch him.

334
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,595
Yes, Madam.

335
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,557
Come here! Come here to mark the seat.

336
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,115
Stop the others from coming.

337
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,640
Old Te, were you scared?

338
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,153
You need this gun for evidence.

339
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,108
Oh. I forgot.

340
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,435
He was stunned.

341
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,711
This coffee came from my friend
in Brazil. Try it.

342
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,835
Thank you, sir.

343
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,750
I've read the report
on yesterday's incidence.

344
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,796
Mr.Wei.

345
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,319
We got no full marks,

346
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,748
but I'm satisfied with the result.

347
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,319
Had we captured on alive,
we could get more clues.

348
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,433
I like you for your serious attitude.

349
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,474
You're already so busy.
Take 2 days' leave.

350
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,595
Thank you, sir.

351
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,628
A fish has swallowed the bait.

352
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,599
Go and see.

353
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,390
A big fish.

354
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,955
Even you've caught it,
must be a stupid fish.

355
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,640
So you're stupider!

356
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,914
Is that possible?
It's going to drop down.

357
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,599
Catch it at once.
Be careful...

358
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,440
I've seen it. So it's a crafty fish.

359
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,640
Is it?

360
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,392
There's no lack of stupid fish.
Let's catch.

361
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,358
I daren't convey anything to you,

362
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,434
but you can trust me.

363
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,593
Let's me teach you yatching.
Some day we'll cross the Pacific.

364
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,119
Come!

365
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,596
No...

366
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,596
Turn...

367
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,716
Which way.

368
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,711
This away?

369
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,154
Right. Turn.

370
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,352
This way?

371
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,596
Go on.

372
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,399
I did it.

373
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,470
Uncle Te.

374
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,598
Yu, spend more time on Amy

375
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,119
to strengthen the ties.

376
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,389
I wish I could.

377
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,913
But I'm a policeman.

378
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,595
Excuse me.

379
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,636
Okay! Bye-bye.

380
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,155
This is Yu.

381
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,071
What happened?

382
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,916
Mr.Huang.

383
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,071
I've caught Uncle Te
dealing drug with foreigner.

384
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,110
Impossible.

385
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,595
It's true.
I've the video tape for evidence.

386
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,194
Let's make immediate action.
What do you suggest?

387
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,912
No, it could be complicated.

388
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,992
Bring all the tapes to the station
for me to see.

389
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,069
Anything important?

390
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,595
Nothing serious. I'll take you home.

391
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,956
Let's go.

392
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,676
Cindy wants me to remind you
today is Amy birthday.

393
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,633
I know. I know.

394
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,632
See the cake and flowers is ready.
Go and be pardon.

395
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,950
What are you waiting for! Get in!

396
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,951
Girls have to be soothed.

397
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,189
I know, you nosey.

398
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,711
Go now. Amy will be off duty soon.

399
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,155
You're meddlesome.

400
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,631
Only 15 minutes for fooling around.

401
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,109
Two first class airtickets.
Thank you.

402
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,595
Thank you.

403
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,909
Amy.

404
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,598
Can I help you, sir?

405
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,672
Yes. I want 2 tickets for a trip
with my girlfriend.

406
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,997
It's her birthday. Happy birthday!

407
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,675
It's yours.

408
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:27,392
What's it on the tape? Let me show it.

409
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,592
What are you going to cook for me?

410
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,119
Let's eat cakes after dinner.

411
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,839
Don't touch my videotape recorder!
Open the door.

412
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,989
Open up!
What are you doing?

413
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,075
It's none of your business.

414
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,596
Come out...

415
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,439
Who told you to watch my videotape.

416
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,995
Well, you're keeping
such a serious thing from me.

417
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:05,791
What is it?

418
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,069
Are you taking me for your brother.

419
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,640
Speak up...

420
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,640
Uncle Te's your master,

421
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,278
but he's keeping it from you.

422
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,631
It means he doesn't trust me.

423
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,712
Who knows?
You're taking him for you dad.

424
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,193
How do I know you're an accessory?

425
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,835
Would I be an accessory to this?

426
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,712
I went through everything with you

427
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,313
and you suspect me?

428
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,269
You're so impulsive.
How could I tell you?

429
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,118
It would only ruin you.

430
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,673
What have you to fear now?

431
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,673
I'm not afraid either. Be he a tiger,

432
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,313
or my own dad.

433
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,393
I'll take him if he sells drug.

434
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,595
I'll go and arrest him right now.

435
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,031
Let's go!

436
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,673
Don't be so impulsive!

437
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,950
Any rash action will ruin everything.

438
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,079
Aren't we brothers?

439
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,598
Listen this is only between me
and Mr.Huang.

440
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:11,956
And me.

441
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,309
Yes...!

442
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,795
Remember, don't take individual action
if you discover anything. Okay?

443
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,278
Bad. I must explain to Amy.

444
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,355
Don't do anything foolish!

445
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,555
Listen.

446
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,915
It hurts!

447
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,600
Go now, or I'll call the police
and accuse you of trespassing.

448
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,869
You must be joking.

449
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,195
Who's joking with you?

450
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,911
Amy.

451
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,399
I won't see you anymore. Go away!

452
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,474
My hand!

453
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,878
You're not going? I will.

454
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,436
What are you doing?

455
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,470
Don't go.

456
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,470
Are you taking me for a criminal?

457
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,916
Yes. I sue you for willful damage
to a policeman's pride.

458
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,474
I must question you now.

459
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,710
I've followed you all the way
and kept saying 'sorry'.

460
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,670
What else do you want?

461
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,599
Mr.Fan, I want you to have
some respect for me.

462
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,870
You come to see me
when you're in the mood.

463
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,996
You leave me behind and say sorry

464
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,479
when you're not.

465
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,640
What are you taking me for?

466
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,313
My girlfriend, worthy of my respect.

467
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,640
Have my action to show
how important you're to me.

468
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,596
I'll keep you company
till tomorrow morning.

469
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,438
I'll quit as a policeman. Okay?

470
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,595
No.

471
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,036
I'll give you as a citizen to go out.

472
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,993
I'll break with anyone else,
but I won't let you go.

473
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,119
Let me go!

474
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,437
No, you mean everything to me.

475
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,190
I can't cook
if you don't let me go, jerk.

476
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,915
Right, right, I must let you go.

477
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,710
Let me see if you're hurt.

478
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,750
A policeman gets more sentence
for indecent assault.

479
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,353
I couldn't care less.

480
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,269
Yu, what are you up to?
Come and help.

481
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,919
I'm preparing a birthday gift for you.

482
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,314
Come and eat.

483
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,759
The big gift is here.

484
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,474
Am I sweet?

485
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,198
Take me.

486
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,557
Disgusting...

487
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,033
Shirley, have you got the key?

488
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,275
Yes,

489
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,596
but Hsiu never allowed me to open it,

490
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,113
and I don't know what it contains.

491
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,109
Did you give him this?

492
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,393
He always kept everything to himself.

493
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,589
Over $10 million!

494
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,320
Impossible for a man
of his family background!

495
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,636
And these 2 passports!
What are they for?

496
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,836
This must be ill-gotten money.

497
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,876
These passports are to help
use another identity,

498
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,555
to get out of HK, in case of need.

499
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,598
Wish my reasoning was wrong.

500
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,953
I've recently got a tip-off that,

501
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,350
someone abused his power
for dope-push.

502
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,598
I thought he was honest.

503
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,558
Shirley, I know how you feel.

504
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,672
Please face up to reality.

505
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,996
There's indeed something wrong
with him,

506
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,675
but I'll help you find out the truth.

507
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,189
Buy a flag, sir...

508
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,389
Follow that white car in front.

509
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,756
Royal HK policeman,
no more police affair.

510
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,554
No,

511
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,517
I'm all yours tonight.

512
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,955
GET LOST.

513
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,590
Police.

514
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,509
Drop your gun!

515
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,276
Drop your gun too, old Te.

516
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,640
Terry, I...

517
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,200
Stay to speak to the judge.
Filing it to see.

518
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,589
Get you handcuffs and put them on,

519
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,394
those two foreigners.

520
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,554
Terry.

521
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,435
You're trafficking in drugs.

522
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,558
As a policeman,
you know the law and violate it.

523
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,313
I was as hot-tempered
when I was young.

524
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,709
I understood.

525
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,231
Why did you do that?

526
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,351
I've followed you since I left school.

527
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,552
I took you for my master, my dad,

528
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,590
but now it's all over between us.

529
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,314
You're under arrest.

530
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,591
Arrest me? I was braver than you.

531
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,679
What did I get for arresting
some small frys.

532
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,914
2 lousy medals.

533
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,038
When the weather's bad,
it hurts and I can't sleep.

534
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,953
They did it again once
they got discharged.

535
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,719
I am a small fry too.

536
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,593
A small fry or a big shot.

537
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,473
I don't care.

538
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:16,509
Terry, you're still young
and you're your idea.

539
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,599
When you reach my age and are,

540
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,750
in my straitened circumstances.

541
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,991
You'll see how important money is.

542
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,749
Shut up!
Don't find an excuse for yourself.

543
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,553
Terry, let me go.

544
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,358
Sorry, Uncle Te.

545
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:49,596
I know you're nice to me,
but I've no choice.

546
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,640
I caught Te dealing in drugs

547
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,756
with 2 foreigners
in Stephen Bay, Stanley.

548
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,440
Come on.

549
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,109
Stop...!

550
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,510
Don't move, or you'll die.

551
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:47,796
Sir,

552
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,996
these 2 foreigners dealt in drugs
with Uncle Te.

553
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,593
I've got the tape for evidence.

554
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,231
Well done! You're done a great credit.

555
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,149
Handcuff Uncle Te.

556
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,874
Yes, sir.

557
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,911
I'll fix everything with your boss.
Leave now.

558
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,588
Okay!

559
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,795
Why do you want to kill him?

560
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,955
You'll die for sure if he doesn't.

561
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,479
I'd rather go to jail...

562
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,198
than to kill him.

563
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,470
You're my best aide. I'll cover you up.

564
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,594
I quit.

565
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,557
Finish this case for me first.

566
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,596
You know how to handle the things here.

567
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,193
You gave personal assurance that,

568
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,234
everything would be okay.

569
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,871
Only about the stuff. I'm not your nanny.

570
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,557
I've overassessed you.

571
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,513
You can't even finish a kid.

572
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,719
Now the co-operation is over between us.

573
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,590
Our market in New York is so big.

574
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,392
Many in HK would vie to be my sidekick.

575
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,033
Okay, no problem.

576
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,588
Listen,

577
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,911
no one dare touch any deals I touched.

578
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,909
Hong Kong is mine,
and you're not the only market in USA.

579
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,593
Get out of HK and return to New York.

580
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,595
Hold it, Michael!

581
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,959
I came here to make money,
not to make enemy.

582
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,395
Okay, I'll trust you one more time.

583
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,432
Well, if you want co-operation,
do one thing for me.

584
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,596
I want 200 kilos of stuff tomorrow night.

585
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,759
This is my A/C No.,

586
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,676
Credit the money into it.
You'll get the stuff tomorrow night.

587
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,593
The killer can never get away.

588
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,599
We can get hold of him for sure.

589
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,709
Morning!

590
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,200
What's wrong?
Why are you all wearing a stone face?

591
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,429
A bereavement?

592
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,595
Ah Yu.
Ah Yu, come in!

593
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,078
Shirley, please go out for a while.

594
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,473
Ah Yu, close the door please.

595
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,959
I've ascertained
Hsiu's drug-trafficking.

596
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,113
Is that so? Does Shirley know it?

597
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,635
I'm not too sure.

598
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,279
Would she be an accessory?

599
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,312
We must take more care from now on.

600
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,318
I don't think Shirley has a hand on it.

601
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,596
Here's a cassette of
Te's drug-trafficking.

602
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,591
It's of serious consequence.

603
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,314
Formerly it was Hsiu, now it's Uncle Te.

604
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,279
How many more are involved
I don't know.

605
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,393
Yu, have you got any other evidence?

606
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,278
I've put a tape at Amy's.

607
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,629
Is that so?

608
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,156
Don't worry.

609
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,912
Amy knows nothing about it.

610
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,437
We must get it back as soon as possible.

611
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,190
For Amy's safety,
don't tell anyone about it.

612
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,589
I know what to do.

613
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,628
Shirley, please come in.

614
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:40,195
Yu, I want to talk to you.

615
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,551
Keep cool.

616
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,640
Something happened last night.

617
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,595
What is it?

618
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,835
Come in.

619
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,589
Mr.Huang.

620
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:54,552
Shirley,
put this important item in a safe.

621
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,078
Aren't you afraid
she might be Te's accompany.

622
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,074
Impossible.

623
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,309
Terry was killed yesterday.

624
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,515
What?

625
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:18,833
He knew about Old Te.

626
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,039
I must go out for a while.

627
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,915
Old Te, hold it! You creep!

628
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,632
You ruined Terry. I'll kill you!

629
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,631
Ah Yu.

630
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,711
Are you crazy? Uncle Te's taking
Terry for his own son. You're mistaken.

631
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,396
Yu, don't get the wrong idea.
He won't do that.

632
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,555
Are you crazy.

633
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,470
Stop!

634
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,675
What happened?

635
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,640
A policeman trafficking in drugs
can do anything.

636
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,950
Quiet! We're all friends.
Let's talk it over.

637
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:55,836
Let me go!

638
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,871
I've proof of your drug-trafficking.

639
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,955
I've already reported to Mr.Huang.
I'll testify against you.

640
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,673
Yu, don't be impulsive.

641
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,630
You did report to me,
but I can't accuse Te,

642
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,473
before I see the evidence.

643
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,914
It must be him.

644
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,592
I've got tapes of your drug-trafficking.

645
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,590
Nonsense.

646
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,239
Shirley, run it for him.

647
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,154
Run it for him.

648
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,435
Don't...

649
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,436
Run it.

650
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,869
How come?

651
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,200
Obviously the cassette has been swapped.

652
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,873
What? Where's the evidence?

653
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,631
You yourself are under suspicion.

654
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,034
You're exposing your own crime.

655
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,195
Last time Hsiu got killed

656
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,237
because you planted a smoke bomb.

657
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,550
This time Terry got killed
because you abandoned your duty.

658
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,470
What explanation can you give?

659
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,436
Search his locker!

660
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,715
I saw him putting heroin in...

661
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,912
I also saw you put heroin
into the locker.

662
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,678
Let's search together.

663
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,110
I'm not afraid. You're finished.
Give me the key.

664
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,475
Don't try anything foolish.

665
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,715
Keep away!

666
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,596
Uncle Te, the key!

667
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,309
Pheasant.

668
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,354
Sorry, Uncle Te.

669
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,595
Keep cool.

670
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:38,835
Don't mess around.

671
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,273
Uncle Te, you really did it.

672
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,470
You put aside my book
and said it was missing.

673
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,834
Will you search more thoroughly?

674
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,359
We've searched everything.
There's nothing.

675
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,553
Let's search his home.

676
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,358
Ah Yu, your locker...

677
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,276
Open it and see.

678
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,156
Okay.

679
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,150
Search!

680
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,675
You really did it.
No.

681
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,029
Yu, calm down.

682
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,230
Are you going to tell me this is flour?

683
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,640
This bag is not mine.

684
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,595
Calm down.

685
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,591
Believe me, Shirley, believe me.

686
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:34,999
Now I won't trust anyone.

687
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,872
I only believe in truth and evidence.

688
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,872
You're arrested for drug possession.

689
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,753
Shirley, I know Te is not alone
in the frame-up.

690
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,594
Soon I'll seek them out! Watch out.

691
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,756
Do you mean us? Don't frame us.

692
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,478
Don't get us involved
because you're evil.

693
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,471
Quiet, this is not a market.

694
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,472
You're the Discipline Unit.

695
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,628
I'll investigate the accusation
between Yu and Uncle Te.

696
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,394
You'll also be subject to
internal investigation.

697
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,599
I'm drug lnvestigation

698
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,199

Police Force,

00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:22,193
with the Drug lnvestigation Dept
of the Special Operations.

703
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,390
Where do you live?

704
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,159
You know it already.

705
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,594
As a policeman, you should know...

706
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,039
I know better in this respect.

707
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,031
I've discovered heroin in your locker,
how do you explain that?

708
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,397
I was framed. Why should I explain?

709
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,393
Possess no drugs,
why should I be question.

710
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,640
There's no evidence
to support your state.

711
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,278
You mean you've proof against me?

712
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,596
Can you think of anything
to prove your innocence?

713
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,318
Law requires evidence.

714
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,351
All your statement may be used
as evidence in court.

715
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,635
Okay, I'll give my statement.

716
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,714
I deal in drugs, smuggling and,

717
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,313
resort to killing, arson and robbery.

718
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,434
Take it down as a matter of routine!
Come on.

719
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,431
Evidence in Court? Take it down!

720
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,589
Ah Yu.

721
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,593
My name is Fan Shun-yu,
I don't know you.

722
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:05,830
I suspect Insp Ho Hsueh-ling's
conspiracy against me.

723
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,436
Take it down! Sue me.

724
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:46,279
The time is 20th Oct 1988 at 3p.m.

725
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:49,916
I'm Anti-Narcotics Bureau detective
Fan Shun-yu No. 3368.

726
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,549
I suspect my Sergeant Feng Chien-te
of drug-trafficking.

727
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,756
As a result of 3 days probe and trace.

728
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,558
I've discovered him
dealing in drugs with...

729
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,598
2 unidentified foreigners on a ferry,

730
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,195
deduced that he used
his detective identity,

731
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:05,029
to cover up his trafficking activities.

732
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,116
Mr.Huang.

733
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,429
Mr.Huang?

734
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,715
I'm Old Te, I've searched
the whole house.

735
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,915
There are many cassettes,

736
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,678
but not the one you mention.

737
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,069
Come back before we take any action.

738
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:44,709
Any clues?

739
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,759
Go back and take a rest.
I'll take charge here.

740
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,550
Mr.Huang.

741
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,438
I believe you are innocent.

742
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,154
Mr.Huang, you must help me on this.

743
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,640
Who else knows the old Te case,

744
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:20,709
besides me?

745
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:24,995
Terry.

746
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,036
You know Terry is impulsive.

747
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,710
Now you've ruined him and yourself.

748
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:39,592
The first thing is to prove
your innocence.

749
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,950
Take me to get the copy of cassette
you mentioned.

750
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,119
Don't you trust me?

751
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,150
Shun-yu.

752
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:05,589
Have you seen the cassette
I taped yesterday?

753
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,955
Yes. Besides Te, there's...

754
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,119
Go on! Speak up!

755
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:14,278
I don't know, I don't know anything.

756
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,675
Do you know or not?

757
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,393
I know nothing.

758
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,950
The cassette is very important to Yu.

759
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,918
Bring it if you know where it is.

760
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,831
There's no such a cassette.

761
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,991
There must be.
I ran it on this VTR recorder last night.

762
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,155
Have you ever taken it away?

763
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,514
NO, I didn't even touch it.

764
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:39,834
Just now you said got it.

765
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:40,915
Without it,

766
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,429
I can't clear myself. I'll be in jail.

767
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,513
Do you know it or don't you?

768
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:47,595
I know...

769
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,034
Now get it.

770
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,593
You don't want Yu to get into trouble.

771
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,072
I promise. I'll quit once I'm cleared.

772
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:22,595
I'm so scared!

773
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,396
Why? It's okay if you find the cassette.

774
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,278
Well, Yu, we must leave.

775
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,676
Amy's going to be alright,
I'll have someone watch her.

776
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:34,276
I'm Michael,

777
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,398
now at 5 Conduit Garden 26th floor.

778
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,035
Send someone,
a woman needs protection.

779
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,038
Yu, we're in a hurry.

780
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,389
Excuse me.

781
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,914
Shun Yu, I want no protection.

782
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,596
I'm alright, I'll return soon.

783
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,076
Bye-bye!

784
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,190
Let's go!

785
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,079
Please call 3388,

786
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,591
Amy urgent. Tell her to call my home.

787
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,834
Mr.Huang,
let's return to Hq Handcuff me.

788
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,913
Okay, this will save us
from unnecessary complaints.

789
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,631
Bear with it now
and soon you'll clear your's.

790
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,588
Mr.Huang, sorry for the trouble.

791
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:29,955
Don't mention it.

792
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,394
Mr.Huang, it was these foreigners
who deal with Te.

793
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,312
Turn around and arrest them!

794
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,593
Amy, what happened?

795
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,958
Shirley, Michael masterminded
Te's dope-pushing.

796
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,314
He won't do that.

797
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,708
It's true.

798
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,310
He just took that cassette away,
I'm scared.

799
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,631
Keep calm, don't go away.

800
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,631
Tell me in detail.

801
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:11,598
Michael mastermined Te's dope-pushing.

802
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,955
Believe me...

803
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:03,956
Stop!

804
01:10:58,920 --> 01:10:59,830
Come in!

805
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,072
Why are you coming to see me
at this hour.

806
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,596
You're depressed, don't drink so much.

807
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,913
After so much has happened,
go for a pleasure tour.

808
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,678
Amy spoke to me over the phone
before her dead.

809
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,314
Is that so?

810
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,319
What did she say to you?

811
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:26,833
Yu is innocent of drug possession.

812
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,640
A big shot is behind
Te's drug-trafficking.

813
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:30,989
Who?

814
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:32,912
You should know better.

815
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,593
Yes, I got Amy's phone too.

816
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,952
You did drug-trafficking with Yu.

817
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:41,437
Now I really understand you.

818
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:42,789
Are you a human being?

819
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,871
After all these, and you want
to make me the scapegoat.

820
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,592
I can say it is you
who want to make me the scapegoat.

821
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,560
Yes, with my name and position
in the police force,

822
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,073
my words will convince everyone.

823
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,357
Now listen,
I Michael Huang am a drug-trafficking.

824
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,589
What have got anything
to accuse me of it.

825
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,072
I've a copy of
Te's drug-trafficking tape.

826
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:02,670
I've a copy too.
His crime is not linked with me.

827
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:03,750
I can testify against you.

828
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:11,590
Testify against me?

829
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,274
That tape even if released to the world
won't serve any purpose,

830
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,278
because only Te can testify against me.

831
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:40,359
Vincent, yes, I'm Michael.

832
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,788
Finish off Te right away.

833
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,393
I'll hand the stuff
over to you in person.

834
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:53,349
We've been getting on well
because you're obedient.

835
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:55,593
But, unfortunately...

836
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,589
Mr.Feng, telephone.

837
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:52,590
Yes, speaking.

838
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,592
The long distance call from Canada
is connect.

839
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:56,070
Thank you.

840
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,117
Darling.

841
01:13:59,320 --> 01:13:59,991
Daddy.

842
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,075
Yes.

843
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,116
What is it?

844
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:05,640
I'll fly to Canada
at 7 tomorrow morning.

845
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:06,675
What?

846
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:11,872
The Hq has approved
my early retirement for health reasons.

847
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,592
Have you received my remittance?

848
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,595
Don't move.

849
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,353
Old Te...

850
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:57,629
No monkey business!

851
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:17,430
Hell with you!

852
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:55,597
Damn, I'll kill you...

853
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:58,390
Kill...

854
01:16:58,640 --> 01:16:59,675
Let's go.

855
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:26,555
Have you found out everything?

856
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:29,069
This resignation letter
has explained everything.

857
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,230
I'm extremely sorry,

858
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:31,998
I didn't discover
my subordinate's misbehavour...

859
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:33,588
till now.

860
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:37,355
I ready for disciplinary action
and investify.

861
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:38,959
But I've a request.

862
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,633
I wish I could arrest these men myself.

863
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:44,476
I hope Mr.Wei will give me this chance
before I leave.

864
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,358
Good, go ahead.

865
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:47,629
Thank you, sir.

866
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,031
Ladies and gentleman,

869
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:58,599
I personally can't shirk the responsible
for this disgrace.

870
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,920
They're now fugitives with arms.

871
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,992
We must bring them to book.

872
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:06,196
Please put personal feelings aside.

873
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:09,194
Shoot anyone on sight
who tries to resist.

874
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,031
Bitch!

875
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:21,196
I've already done what you want.
What about the stuff?

876
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,235
Let me finish off that bitch.

877
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,710
No, I'll fix her for you.

878
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:27,878
I'll take your life
if I can't get the cargo tonight.

879
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:33,555
Come on.

01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,955
Michael's drug trafficking proof
in Jackson Road.

883
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,390
Tell her to come at once.
Yes, thank you.

884
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,589
All the cargo is in the car.

885
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:29,392
Making fun of me? Damn you.

886
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:33,595
Michael Huang.

887
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:41,952
Damn killing you with I shot
is too good for you.

888
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,590
I want you to be a limply in jail
all your life.

889
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,592
You're wanted.
What have you got to arrest.

890
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:47,675

Damn you double-crosser I'll kill you.

I made much money for you
and you got men to kill me?

899
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:24,559
I'll kill you double crosser!

902
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,039
None can testify against me
when you're dead.

903
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:17,269
Let's perish together.

904
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:46,108
Scum, traitor, I'll kill you!

905
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:03,635

01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:55,156
You lie!

910
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,078

01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:00,476
Mr. Wei...

913
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:01,470
No need to talk now.

914
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:04,200
We now have ample evidence for your
drug trafficking you're under arrest.

915
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:08,360

01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:10,390

920
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:25,230
So we meet again.

921
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:27,190
Drive the car over.

922
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:28,874
Drive the car over away.

923
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:29,950

Hold it. Thank you.

925
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,517
Without your help
I would have cracked this case.

you've suffered.
