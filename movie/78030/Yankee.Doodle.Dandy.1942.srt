2111
01:58:07,789 --> 01:58:10,833
We entertained the royalty
But we were never flustered

2112
01:58:11,043 --> 01:58:14,045
We gave them Yankee hot dogs
With Colman's English Mustard

2113
01:58:14,254 --> 01:58:16,547
Don't print it
Strictly off the record

2114
01:58:17,299 --> 01:58:20,176
It's pleasant at the White House
But I'll tell you how I feel

2115
01:58:20,385 --> 01:58:23,345
The food is simply terrible
Just sauerkraut and veal

2116
01:58:23,555 --> 01:58:26,515
If Mrs. R. would stay at home
I'd get a decent meal

2117
01:58:26,725 --> 01:58:29,143
But that's off the record

2118
01:59:08,058 --> 01:59:09,433
When I go up to Hyde Park

2119
01:59:09,643 --> 01:59:11,102
It's not for just the ride there

2120
01:59:11,311 --> 01:59:12,645
It's not that I like Hyde Park

2121
01:59:12,854 --> 01:59:14,438
But I love to park and hide there

2122
01:59:14,648 --> 01:59:16,398
Don't print it
It's strictly off the record

2123
01:59:17,651 --> 01:59:20,569
I sit up in my study
Writing gags for Mr. Ickes

2124
01:59:20,779 --> 01:59:22,196
And insults for the gentlemen

2125
01:59:22,405 --> 01:59:23,864
Who'd love to slip him Mickeys

2126
01:59:24,074 --> 01:59:26,492
Don't print that
Off the record

2127
01:59:42,801 --> 01:59:45,886
I scrapped the Prohibition Act
When we required a bracer

2128
01:59:46,096 --> 01:59:49,181
And finished up the Boulder Dam
To give the boys a chaser

2129
01:59:49,391 --> 01:59:52,184
Don't print it
It's strictly off the record

2130
01:59:52,394 --> 01:59:55,396
And for my friends in Washington
Who complain about the taxes

2131
01:59:55,605 --> 01:59:58,649
Who cares as long as we can knock
The ax out of the Axis?

2132
01:59:58,859 --> 02:00:01,694
Don't print it
It's strictly off the record

2133
02:00:01,903 --> 02:00:04,947
I can't forget how Lafayette
Helped give us our first chance

2134
02:00:05,157 --> 02:00:08,033
To win our fight for liberty
And now they've taken France

2135
02:00:08,243 --> 02:00:11,120
We'll take it back from Hitler
And put ants in his Ja-pants

2136
02:00:11,329 --> 02:00:13,873
And that's for the record

2137
02:00:14,082 --> 02:00:16,041
[AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING]

2138
02:00:29,681 --> 02:00:32,474
Good work, kids.
I'll see you at 11 in the morning.

2139
02:00:35,437 --> 02:00:38,189
And then came your wire,
and I was really worried.

2140
02:00:38,899 --> 02:00:41,942
Well, here I am going on like Tennyson's book,
giving you the story of my life.

2141
02:00:42,152 --> 02:00:44,069
I'm sorry. You should've stopped me.

2142
02:00:44,279 --> 02:00:46,739
Why, I wanted to hear
the story of your life.

2143
02:00:46,948 --> 02:00:50,326
It has a direct bearing
on my sending for you.

2144
02:00:50,535 --> 02:00:52,494
Do you know what this is?

2145
02:00:54,164 --> 02:00:55,497
The Congressional Medal of Honor.

2146
02:00:55,707 --> 02:00:57,666
Let's see what the inscription says.

2147
02:00:58,585 --> 02:01:00,544
PRESIDENT [READING INSCRIPTION]:

2148
02:01:10,889 --> 02:01:13,140
I congratulate you, Mr. Cohan.

2149
02:01:13,350 --> 02:01:17,603
I understand you're the first person
of your profession to receive this honor.

2150
02:01:17,812 --> 02:01:19,855
You should be very proud.

2151
02:01:20,065 --> 02:01:21,565
Oh, I am proud.

2152
02:01:21,775 --> 02:01:23,317
In fact, I'm flabbergasted.

2153
02:01:23,526 --> 02:01:25,569
First time in my life,
I'm speechless.

2154
02:01:25,779 --> 02:01:28,322
Uh... You're sure there
isn't some mistake?

2155
02:01:28,531 --> 02:01:30,241
Quite sure.

2156
02:01:31,618 --> 02:01:35,162
This medal is for people who've given their lives
for their country or done something big.

2157
02:01:35,372 --> 02:01:37,748
I'm just a song-and-dance man.
Everybody knows that.

2158
02:01:37,958 --> 02:01:42,753
A man may give his life to his country
in many different ways, Mr. Cohan.

2159
02:01:42,963 --> 02:01:47,174
And quite often, he isn't the best judge
of how much he has given.

2160
02:01:47,384 --> 02:01:50,844
Your songs were a symbol
of the American spirit.

2161
02:01:51,054 --> 02:01:54,890
"Over There" was just as powerful
a weapon as any cannon...

2162
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:58,519
...as any battleship we had
in the first World War.

2163
02:01:58,728 --> 02:02:02,147
Today, we're all soldiers.
We're all on the front.

2164
02:02:02,357 --> 02:02:05,276
We need more songs to express America.

2165
02:02:05,485 --> 02:02:09,154
I know you and your comrades
will give them to us.

2166
02:02:09,364 --> 02:02:13,242
Mr. President, I've just begun
to earn this medal.

2167
02:02:13,451 --> 02:02:14,868
It's quite a thing.

2168
02:02:15,078 --> 02:02:20,124
Well, it's the best material we could find,
what with priorities and all.

2169
02:02:21,626 --> 02:02:23,335
Good-bye, sir.

2170
02:02:23,962 --> 02:02:27,423
And I want you to know
that I'm not the only one that's grateful.

2171
02:02:27,632 --> 02:02:29,550
My mother thanks you,
my father thanks you...

2172
02:02:29,759 --> 02:02:32,928
...my sister thanks you,
and I assure you, I thank you.

2173
02:02:33,138 --> 02:02:36,640
And, uh, I wouldn't worry
about this country if I were you.

2174
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:38,475
We've got this thing licked.

2175
02:02:38,685 --> 02:02:42,479
Where else could a plain guy like me come in
and talk things over with the head man?

2176
02:02:42,689 --> 02:02:44,982
Well, that's about as good
a definition of America...

2177
02:02:45,191 --> 02:02:46,859
...as any I've ever heard.

2178
02:02:47,068 --> 02:02:49,320
Good-bye, Mr. Cohan, and good luck.

2179
02:02:49,529 --> 02:02:51,780
Good-bye, sir, and good luck to you.
