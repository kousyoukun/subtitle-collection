00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,600
I call it a hit.
What'll your review say?

2
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,200
- I like it too, so I guess I'll pan it.
- That's logical.

3
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,700
My publisher resents Cohan
impersonating the president of the U.S.

4
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,600
Says our young readers dream
of being president.

5
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,000
"I'd rather be right than be president."
Cohan may find out he isn't either one.

6
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,100
- See how George does it at his age.
- I remember him when I was little.

7
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,700
Congratulations, George, old boy.
You did a great job.

8
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,700
- Thanks.
- Congratulations, Mr. Cohan.

9
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,100
- You had him down to a tee.
- But we're still on dangerous ground.

10
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,100
Imitating the president,
a lot of people won't like it.

11
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,600
It's good, clean fun.
Didn't they enjoy it in Boston?

12
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,900
Never could do anything wrong in Boston.

13
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,900
Greatest man in the U.S. Played by the
greatest actor. Nothing wrong with that.

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,200
Especially when the greatest actor
is my husband.

15
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,800
- This could be treason.
- A dollar-a-year man will take care of you.

16
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,700
A lot of them would like
to shoot actors.

17
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,000
Save these telegrams.
Government needs paper.

18
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,800
You've got a list with everybody
but Hirohito.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,100
- We'll bring him in.
- Here's the one I sent.

20
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,100
- Will you read our cleverness?
- What makes you think I didn't?

21
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,800
I didn't know there was that much love left
in the entire Western Union codebook.

22
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,800
Hold that. Thank you. Thank you.

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
- Don't bother me.
- It's from the White House.

24
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,700
- Well, that bothers me.
- Here.

25
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,400
You read it.
These aren't my reading glasses.

26
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,900
"George M. Cohan,
The Alvin Theater, New York.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,700
The president requests that you call
upon him at your earliest convenience...

28
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
...in regard to a personal matter.

29
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,000
Kindly reply for definite appointment
at White House.

30
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,200
Stephen T. Early,
secretary to the president."

31
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,500
There you are, Sam.
There you are. What did I tell you?

32
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,400
Coming at a time like this,
with everything on his mind...

33
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,500
...this is not just a casual invitation.
This is important.

34
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,400
- I think we're in trouble.
- Don't worry.

35
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,900
They don't telegraph you
to come and be shot at sunrise.

36
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,200
- He doesn't get up that early.
- I've got a run-of-the-play contract.

37
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,100
Fine time to make lame jokes.

38
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,400
I'm worried, Sam.

39
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,700
I'm really worried.

40
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,300
Halt!

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,700
- What can I do for you?
- I've got an appointment.

42
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,200
- The name, please?
- Cohan. George M. Cohan.

43
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,900
All right, sir. If you'll wait
just one moment, I'll call.

44
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,600
This is Sgt. Lewis
at the Pennsylvania Avenue gate...

45
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,900
- Good evening, Mr. Cohan.
- Good evening.

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,900
- We've been expecting you.
- Thank you.

47
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,900
Why, your coat's wet.

48
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,200
- Didn't you come in a car?
- No, I walked up from the station.

49
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,300
Washington's a great town to walk in.
Always get a kick out of it.

50
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Yes, indeed.
Won't you come with me?

51
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,500
I was supposed to be off duty
this evening, Mr. Cohan...

52
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,600
...but when I heard you was coming, I
thought I'd like to see if you look the same.

53
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,300
- That depends on when you saw me last.
- It must have been 30-some years ago.

54
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,100
I was valet for Teddy Roosevelt.

55
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,500
He got me a seat up in the gallery.
The play was <i>George Washington Jr...</i>

56
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,000
...and you was just singing and dancing
all about the grand old flag.

57
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,200
Mr. Teddy used to sing it in his bathtub.

58
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
- It was a good old song in its day.
- It was.

59
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,100
And it's just as good today
as it ever was.

60
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
Come in.

61
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,300
Well, hello there.
How's my double?

62
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,200
Your double isn't too sure.
Give me time to work on that.

63
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,800
- I was told you knew all the answers.
- There was a time when I thought so.

64
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,400
- Right now, I wish I did.
- Yes, so do I.

65
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,200
- Sit down, Mr. Cohan.
- Thanks.

66
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,500
You know, I'm a little bit nervous.

67
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,700
- I'm sorry I missed the opening of your show.
- Maybe just as well.

68
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,600
Don't worry about it.
We understand each other perfectly.

69
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
I think so.

70
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,100
<i>Herald Tribune</i> says that you make a better
president in <i>I'd Rather Be Right</i> than I am.

71
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,500
Don't forget,
that's a Republican newspaper.

72
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,100
I can remember you and your family
very well. The Four Cohans.

73
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,500
Do you really?
That's a long time ago.

74
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,600
Yes. It was while I was
attending school near Boston.

75
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,600
I was a pretty cocky kid those days.
Pretty cocky kid.

76
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,800
A regular Yankee Doodle Dandy.
Always carrying a flag in a parade.

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,100
- I hope you haven't outgrown the habit.
- Not a chance.

78
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,500
That's one thing I always admired
about you Irish-Americans.

79
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,500
You carry your love of country like a flag,
right out in the open. A great quality.

80
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,600
I inherited that.
I got that from my father.

81
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,000
He ran away to the Civil War at 13. Proudest
kid in the whole state of Massachusetts.

82
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,600
So you've spent your life telling the
other 47 states what a great country it is.

83
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,300
I never thought of it that way before,
but that's about the size of it.

84
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,100
And I lost no time either.

85
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,100
It started with a very funny incident
about 60 years ago.

86
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,900
<i>It was in Providence, Rhode Island,</i>
<i>on the 4th of July.</i>

87
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,900
<i>There weren't so many stars then,</i>
<i>in the flag or on the stage...</i>

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,900
<i>... but folks knew more were coming.</i>

89
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,000
<i>They were optimistic,</i>
<i>happy and expectant.</i>

90
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,300
<i>The beginning of the Horatio Alger age.</i>

91
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,600
<i>My father played in a variety theater,</i>
<i>breaking in a single.</i>

92
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,100
<i>No one was more expectant than he was,</i>
<i>unless it was Mother.</i>

93
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,100
<i>She was busy on a smaller production.</i>

94
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,700
- Message come yet?
- No word, Jerry.

95
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,800
- Take a bow.
- I can't. I gotta get out.

96
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,800
- Watch that border!
- I gotta find out what's happening.

97
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,700
Oh, for heaven's sake, Jerry.

98
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,500
Take up number three.
You're on. Go ahead. Lights up.

99
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,800
- Bye, Sally.
- You can't run through the streets in that.

100
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
- They'll put you in jail.
- They'll have to catch me.

101
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,200
- Don't forget, you're on again at 4:15.
- Don't worry, I'll be back.

102
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,200
- These things take hours sometimes.
- My wife never held up a show in her life.

103
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,900
- Can I get through here?
- The Irish are up in the head of the parade.

104
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,200
- I'm not in the parade. I wanna get through.
- Not a chance, brother.

105
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,600
You don't say!
We'll get you there in a jiffy.

106
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,000
Here, this'll give you courage.
Charge!

107
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,100
Nellie.

108
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,900
- She all right?
- She's fine.

109
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,200
What is it?

110
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,800
Well, all signs point to its being a boy.

111
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,500
He just got here,
and he's sleeping already.

112
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,500
All babies sleep 20 hours a day.

113
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,800
That's why most
never amount to anything.

114
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,900
- What'll we call him?
- I don't know.

115
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,800
- What do you say?
- Seeing that he arrived on the 4th of July...

116
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,800
...what about George Washington Cohan?

117
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,400
Has a nice patriotic ring to it.
What do you think?

118
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,500
The George is fine, but the Washington
may be too long for a billboard.

119
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,700
How about a nice, short Irish name?
Dennis or Michael.

120
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,100
George Michael Cohan.

121
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,200
Yes, I like that name.

122
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,000
Gosh, I forgot.

123
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,700
Hey! It's a boy!

124
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh, Jerry.

125
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,100
Heavenly day, Nellie,
he's crying with a brogue.

126
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,600
<i>The first thing I ever had in my fist</i>
<i>was the American flag.</i>

127
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,300
<i>I hitched my wagon to 38 stars</i>
<i>and 13 stripes.</i>

128
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,900
<i>I was 6 or 7 before I realized they weren't</i>
<i>celebrating my birthday on the 4th of July.</i>

129
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,700
<i>Then my folks had a real break when</i>
<i>my little sister, Josie, made her entrance.</i>

130
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,600
<i>She grew to love show business</i>
<i>just as she loved everybody and everything.</i>

131
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,400
<i>We toured the kerosene circuit on a show</i>
<i>called</i> Daniel Boone on the Trail.

132
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,700
<i>Everybody doubled in brass.</i>
<i>Dad walloped the bass drum.</i>

133
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,700
<i>They teamed me with a donkey.</i>
<i>I was a good Democrat even in those days.</i>

134
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,000
<i>Mother and Josie threw out handbills.</i>

135
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,500
<i>Their smiles would've sold tickets</i>
<i>to wooden Indians.</i>

136
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,300
<i>They kept putting new stars in the flag, and</i>
<i>the Cohans kept rushing out to meet them.</i>

137
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,500
<i>We had jokes to match every cornfield.</i>
<i>We sang at every milk station.</i>

138
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,600
<i>We trouped through depression and inflation,</i>
<i>part of the country's growing pains.</i>

139
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,700
<i>Froze in winter, and roasted in summer.</i>

140
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,500
<i>But it was a good life.</i>

141
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,100
<i>It's a lucky family</i>
<i>that dances together every day.</i>

142
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,800
<i>1891 found our fortunes</i>
<i>flat as a pancake.</i>

143
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,500
<i>Then came jobs for the whole family</i>
<i>in a show called</i> Peck's Bad Boy.

144
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,900
<i>We opened in Brooklyn.</i>

145
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,500
<i>The town was known for spirited audiences</i>
<i>even before it had a ball team.</i>

146
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,900
- Hammering on opening night!
What are you doing here?

147
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,800
- I'm the star of this play.
- You have the leading part, yes.

148
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,400
That means I'm a star...

149
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,900
...and there should be a star on my
dressing-room door. Law of the theater.

150
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,500
- Yes, Jerry, give the devil his due.
- I know, but I'm nervous.

151
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,900
I'll go blank.
I won't be able to remember a line.

152
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,200
Don't worry. If you stick,
I'll throw you the line. You too, Mother.

153
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,200
- It's to jail you're going, me boy.
- Oh, there.

154
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,100
Henry's not really a bad boy.
He's just mischievous, that's all.

155
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,100
Mr. Schults, that should take care
of the damage, don't you think?

156
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,900
Henry, I want you to promise
the cop and Mr. Schults...

157
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,800
...that from now on,
you will always be a good boy.

158
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,100
I'll promise, but I can still lick
any kid in town!

159
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,800
- Fine work, Georgie.
- Thanks.

160
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,600
- Great, Georgie. Great!
- Nice going, kid.

161
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,200
- Real piece of acting there.
- Son, you're going places.

162
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,300
- Boy, you sure rolled them in the aisles.
- Thanks, but why are you surprised?

163
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,100
You could've told during rehearsals
that I'd be a sensation.

164
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,300
Listen, there's nothing
to this acting business.

165
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,600
I wonder what took me so long
to become a star.

166
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,400
Excuse me. Hey! Call rehearsal
for 10:00 tomorrow morning.

167
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,200
Jerry, the time has come
for George's first spanking.

168
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,100
That's right.
I'll hold him, you hit him.

169
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,100
Not me. I don't hit hard enough
to make an impression.

170
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,200
I can't do it. He'd think I'm jealous
because he got more laughs.

171
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,500
Don't think I'm not, either.

172
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Several gentlemen to see you outside,
Mr. Cohan.

173
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,500
Gentlemen of the press, I presume.
It's started already.

174
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,500
Will you excuse me?

175
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,400
Let's see how tough he is!

176
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,400
Ought to be arrested,
every one of those hoodlums.

177
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,400
It seems to me you're taking this
very calmly, Jerry.

178
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Your own son almost murdered
in cold blood.

179
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,300
The way I figure, it's a fine tribute
to Georgie's acting.

180
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
The way he plays the part,
every tough kid...

181
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,300
...will want to take a punch
at Peck's Bad Boy.

182
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,100
What? Have I gotta go
through that every night?

183
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,700
Yes. And matinees Wednesdays
and Saturdays.

184
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,300
Georgie, those boys did you
a great favor...

185
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,700
...and they saved me a lot of trouble.

186
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,500
Most actors give their whole lives
to their profession without scoring a hit.

187
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,700
You're lucky.
You're a hit at the age of 13.

188
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,100
I've been in this business a long time.
I've never met a performer...

189
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,700
...who in the long run wouldn't rather
be a great guy than a great actor.

190
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,300
That is, until I made your acquaintance.

191
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,800
Can't I be both?

192
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Chances are, the way you're going,
you won't be either.

193
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,500
If the hoodlums don't get you,
a committee of actors will.

194
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,400
Actors are considered a very bad risk
by insurance companies.

195
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,100
Any actor with a conceit like yours,
we just couldn't afford the premium.

196
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,800
What your father really means
is you're too sensitive.

197
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,900
You're too anxious to make good.

198
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,500
You love the theater too much.

199
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,000
Oh, I know you can improve
if you want to.

200
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,000
Sure I can. Just watch me.

201
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,700
From now on, I'm Peck's Bad Boy
only from 8:30 till 11 in the evening.

202
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,200
- That's a boy, Georgie.
- I promise, Mother.

203
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,900
And don't forget, Wednesdays
and Saturdays, 2:30 till 5.

204
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,700
Yes, sir. And the other 21 and a half hours,
I pattern myself after Dad.

205
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,900
Well, you could find a better example,
but that's the general idea.

206
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,700
Jerry, what do you know!
Ed Albee's coming backstage to see you.

207
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,100
- Albee!
- Albee! That's B.F. Keys' partner.

208
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
That's bigtime vaudeville!
We're big time!

209
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,700
He didn't send for us.
He's come here to see us!

210
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,900
It may be better
if I spoke business to him.

211
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,300
I thought you said
you were going to reform.

212
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,800
I'm sorry.

213
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,000
When he comes in,
I want you to keep quiet.

214
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,900
- Look at the condition of this dressing room.
- Get the cheap makeup off the table.

215
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,700
Hurry up!

216
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,500
Quick, Georgie!

217
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Get the stuff off that shelf.
That's right.

218
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Albee will be right in.
He just stopped at the water cooler.

219
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,800
If he offers you a cigar,
don't take it.

220
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,600
I'll take it. It'll impress him
if he thinks I can smoke.

221
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,200
- Get behind that curtain.
- But...

222
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,800
Hurry up! I don't wanna hear a word.
I don't want to even hear you breathe.

223
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,700
Josie, fix the chairs.
The other one.

224
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,300
Here, take this.

225
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Oh, Jerry.

226
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,800
- Sit down, Nellie. Sit down.
- All right.

227
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,200
Come in.

228
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,100
Mr. E.F. Albee.

229
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,800
- Hello, Cohan.
- Albee. Meet Mrs. Cohan.

230
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,100
How do you do?

231
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,400
- Sit down, Mr. Albee.
- Thank you.

232
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,900
I saw your show tonight. Not bad.

233
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,500
Have a cigar?

234
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,000
No, thanks.

235
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,800
Your show's no good for vaudeville, but
I've seen a lot worse right here in Brooklyn.

236
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,900
We're opening a new theater in Philadelphia
on the 4th of July.

237
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,900
If you fix up a good vaudeville act...

238
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,000
...we'll double your salary, give ten weeks'
guarantee and third or fourth billing.

239
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,200
- Double our salary?
- You'll be with the best variety artists.

240
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,100
Vesta victoria, Eddie Foy, Ward & vokes,
Lottie Collins, Charlie Case...

241
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,300
Just a second.

242
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,400
I'm George M. Cohan. You're opening
a theater in Philadelphia on July 4th?

243
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,800
- Yes, that's right.
- That's my birthday.

244
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,100
That isn't why we're opening the theater.

245
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,700
The salary's all right,
but how have you got the nerve...

246
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,600
...to offer us third or fourth billing
after my performance tonight?

247
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,200
Is this kid in your show?

248
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,900
Am I in the show! Who do you think
was Peck's Bad Boy?

249
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,800
I beg your pardon.
I didn't quite recognize you.

250
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,100
You didn't? Then maybe you're not
the showman you're cracked up to be.

251
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,500
- George!
- George!

252
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,600
Well, now, maybe I'm not.

253
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,800
Maybe you're not quite ready
for the big time yet.

254
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,700
Mrs. Cohan. Mr. Cohan.
Good night.

255
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,800
Mr. Albee!

256
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,300
- How do you do, Mr. Albee?
- Good evening.

257
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,900
- Can I call you a carriage?
- Lf you will.

258
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,500
Carriage for Mr. Albee!

259
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You see what happens
because you wouldn't lay a hand on him?

260
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,900
A mother doesn't do any punishing.
She gives her permission.

261
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,000
Have I your permission?

262
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,500
You certainly have.

263
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,700
Shouldn't you get my permission too?

264
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,500
- Not on the hand, he has to play the violin!
- All right, not on the hand.

265
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,500
Not on the mouth, he has to sing!

266
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,800
All right, not on the mouth.
Come here.

267
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,000
Here's one place without any talent!

268
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,800
- Who were Lewis and Clark, George?
- Acrobats?

269
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,500
- Look at this swell write-up we got.
- Write-up?

270
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,200
<i>You found us whenever new states</i>
<i>sprouted on the prairie.</i>

271
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,700
<i>We played every town in America</i>
<i>that had a theater.</i>

272
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,700
- Any mail for Mr. Cohan?
- No. Your father picked up his mail.

273
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,100
I mean for Mr. George M. Cohan.

274
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,900
<i>The next 10 years rushed by</i>
<i>like a circus train.</i>

275
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,300
<i>Dad seemed content with the sticks,</i>
<i>but I was straining at the leash.</i>

276
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,500
- Here's your mail, Mr. Cohan.
- Thanks.

277
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,200
Couple of tickets for the show.

278
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,700
<i>We were playing stock in Buffalo.</i>

279
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,000
<i>And being versatile,</i>
<i>I was playing my mother's father.</i>

280
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,100
- Oh, Daddy, he's left me.
- All is for the best, my daughter.

281
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,600
In life we trip, but right ourselves.

282
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,300
I was correct about man's love.

283
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,200
First, he considers his pleasure
or his honor or his purse.

284
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,900
Only secondly does he think
of the woman he says he loves.

285
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:10,700
Now I must go life's journey alone and
struggle on my weary way to find peace.

286
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,000
Courage, Emily, courage.

287
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,000
Living has taught your father
many things.

288
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,100
Among them,
to take the bitter with the better.

289
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:27,600
The road to happiness is paved
with heartaches and stones.

290
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,000
They're all yours, sweetheart.

291
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,900
Good luck, honey.

292
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,500
There's a young lady. One of those
stage-struck kids would like to talk to you.

293
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,200
Show her in.

294
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,200
All right, miss.

295
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,500
- Mr. Cohan will see you.
- Thank you.

296
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,000
He's all yours.

297
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,900
I'm 18. I sing and I dance,
and I'm going to New York.

298
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,900
Should I?

299
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,300
Oh, Mr. Cohan. You're so old,
and so experienced in the theater...

300
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,600
...so fatherly.

301
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,100
Do you think it's wise?

302
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,400
I mean, my being 18, singing
and dancing, and going to New York.

303
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,100
Well, that's very wise.
I mean, being 18 is very wise.

304
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,000
As for New York, The Four Cohans
open there this fall with their new show...

305
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,900
...with a new cyclorama
and two carloads of scenery.

306
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,000
- Really? When are you leaving here?
- Tomorrow night, right after the show.

307
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,400
Oh, I can't leave till Wednesday.
I graduate from high school Tuesday.

308
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,300
That's too bad.

309
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,500
Georgie... Excuse me. You haven't forgotten
we have a date tonight, have you?

310
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,100
Oh, no, no. Of course not.
We're going roller-skating.

311
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,500
Roller-skating on a night like this?

312
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,100
Why, there's a moon out.

313
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,500
I'll be ready in five minutes.

314
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,600
- Pipperino, isn't she?
- Yes. Is she your daughter?

315
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,400
- I'm not married.
- Your niece, perhaps?

316
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,200
She's just a kid with the show.
We've been dating.

317
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,800
Isn't she a little too young for you?

318
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,800
No. She's getting along in years.
She's 17.

319
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,600
Well, shall I sing for you?

320
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,700
I know I have talent,
even if I am from Buffalo.

321
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,600
We haven't got any piano handy.

322
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,600
Then I'll dance.

323
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,200
That's rather old, isn't it?
Everybody's done that.

324
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,000
You don't want to be just an imitator.

325
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,900
Oh, no.
Here's a step I made up myself.

326
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,200
But on the other hand, you don't want
to be too original, either, do you?

327
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,000
- No.
- I'll tell you what you do.

328
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,700
You sit right here,
and I will give you an idea of what I mean.

329
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,000
It may not be much. I'm not the dancer
I used to be, but then who is?

330
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,800
Now watch carefully, now.

331
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,100
Oh, no, no!

332
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,100
- Don't you like it?
- But your heart!

333
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,900
My heart is every bit as good
as it ever was.

334
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:05,800
Oh, so fast!
Such excitement at your age.

335
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,300
- Sit down and rest.
- Thanks.

336
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,400
Maybe I have overdone it a little.

337
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,600
Look at the perspiration on your brow.

338
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,600
Your wrinkles!
What happened to your wrinkles?

339
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,400
I do have to make up older
than I actually am.

340
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,400
How old are you?

341
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,500
Not yet 70.

342
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,300
You seem different from when I first came in.
Even your voice sounds younger.

343
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,800
It's a gift I have.
I'm always as young as the people I'm with.

344
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,900
And you've made me feel very young.

345
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,000
- Very young.
- I'm glad.

346
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,400
Now, let's make plans.
Which manager shall I take you to see first?

347
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:47,400
Erlanger? Good old Abe's a very nice fellow,
but maybe a little bit too soon.

348
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,500
Tony Pastor?
Well, that's better.

349
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,800
Albee, Coster, Beall and Proctor...

350
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,700
Wait a minute, little girl. Don't let an old
white beard and eyebrows frighten you.

351
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,900
In show business,
you'll see a lot of those.

352
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,400
I'm not sure I wanna go
into show business now.

353
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,500
A girl with your talent and ability? There
are very few who can sing, dance and act.

354
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,200
How do you know I can do those?
You've never seen me.

355
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,200
I don't have to see you.
I can tell a trouper a mile away.

356
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,100
I feel as though I've known you
for years. What's your name?

357
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,500
- Mary.
- That's a very pretty name.

358
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,700
Now, Mary, you calm down.
Let's go and have a bite to eat.

359
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,000
I always eat after the last show.
Are you hungry?

360
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,300
I've been sitting in the theater since 2:00
trying to get up courage to come backstage.

361
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
You must be hungry after seven shows.

362
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,200
We'll have a nice cold bottle and a bird.

363
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,700
What's a cold bottle?

364
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,000
That's what we in show business
call a piece of pie and a glass of milk.

365
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,900
Aren't you going roller-skating
with that pipperino?

366
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,800
I'm tired of picking her up.

367
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,100
What's the matter, darling?

368
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,700
Got it.

369
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,300
Pretty good.

370
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,900
There's a contract on my desk already
made out. Get it.

371
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,300
Hey!

372
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,700
If any of The Four Cohans ask how
you like their act, tell them it was fair.

373
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,700
Ladies and gentlemen,
my mother thanks you.

374
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,000
My father thanks you.

375
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,400
My sister thanks you.

376
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,600
And I thank you.

377
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,600
- Nice going.
- That's tearing them out of their chairs.

378
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,500
All set up for you. Go get them.

379
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,600
After the way we went tonight
we're ready for New York.

380
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,000
If we're a hit here,
it's a cinch in New York.

381
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,600
- Nice going, kid.
- Thanks.

382
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:27,100
Oh, Mr. Cohan, just a minute.
Pretty fair act you folks have got.

383
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,500
- They seemed to like it.
- That's a soft audience.

384
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,400
- Got any open time?
- From now on.

385
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
- I'll make an offer.
- We'd be glad to talk.

386
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,100
Fine. Fine. You know, they're always a
soft audience here on Wednesday. Pushover.

387
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,600
- Did you catch it?
- Oh, you were wonderful, George.

388
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,000
- But I don't know, I miss that beard.
- Did you get up on that number?

389
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,700
It's a lovely song, George.
I've learned it by heart.

390
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,800
Good. I rehearsed it with the orchestra.
You'll do it this show.

391
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,200
He knows your key.
You just follow him for tempo.

392
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,700
But there's a notice. You can't
change your act after the first show.

393
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,100
The manager expects me to sing
"The Wedding of the Lily and the Rose."

394
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Who were they applauding,
the manager or me?

395
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,800
- Now go on out there and do it.
- Oh, George, I can't move.

396
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,400
I can't go out there,
not without rehearsal.

397
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,000
What are you worried about?

398
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,200
You're doing a George M. Cohan lyric
to a George M. Cohan melody.

399
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,500
- Yes, but it's my voice.
- A George M. Cohan discovery.

400
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:25,000
Nobody ever had a better start.
There's your introduction, go on.

401
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,900
Good luck, kid.

402
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,600
Ten consecutive weeks in New York.
That's the big time.

403
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,400
When you leave New York,
Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago...

404
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,600
- Just look at her.
- Excuse me.

405
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,900
What's going on here? Take your
makeup off. I'll be back in just a minute.

406
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,300
Bill, what is this? What's she singing?
Who told her to switch that number?

407
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,300
She's supposed to sing
"The Wedding of the Lily and the Rose."

408
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,800
- Who told her to switch that number?
- I don't know.

409
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,700
You don't know!

410
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:50,200
Bring down that curtain! When she finishes
the chorus pull out the houselights.

411
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,100
Wait a second. See how that song goes.

412
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,200
- The song is gone. Pull out the lights.
- Don't do it, Charlie.

413
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,600
Say, who does she think she is? Who
does she think is running this theater?

414
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,600
The only reason I put her on was
because the dog act got drunk.

415
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,300
- It'll be all right in the morning.
- She was your idea.

416
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,500
- And a very good idea too.
- Now I know who got the dog act drunk.

417
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,800
Who, me? Why I've never been
in a saloon in my life.

418
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,800
Now look at that. Could you ask
for anything more than that?

419
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,500
Mr. Dietz, she's wonderful.
Don't you think so?

420
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,800
Don't do that! Don't do that!

421
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,800
Pull out the lights.
Pull down that curtain.

422
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,900
Get your props together, you're on next.
Start limbering up, you follow the jugglers.

423
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,900
You get that curtain up. You can't ring
down on a George M. Cohan song.

424
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,100
A George... oh, I see!
It's your song. You wrote it.

425
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,900
You can tell that by the applause.

426
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,500
Now, Mary, I want you to do an encore.
Do one more chorus and really do it.

427
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Oh, no, you don't.
Young lady, listen.

428
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,900
If you're gonna try junk like that,
you'll do it on a split beat time.

429
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,200
But you'll not be singing
that in my theater.

430
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,400
You take a little tip from me.
Start packing.

431
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,900
If you've got any squawks, unload
them on me. I started all this.

432
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,100
Listen, squirt. Any more interference and
you'll be blacklisted in show business.

433
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,900
You won't be able to get
into a stage door of any theater.

434
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,100
What's more, as for those songs of yours...

435
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,300
...they won't be played on a hurdy-gurdy.
- Are you trying to threaten me?

436
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,900
- Mary, don't pay any attention to him.
- Get me the key to your dressing room.

437
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,600
Drunk or sober, the dog act goes on
on the next show. And look here...

438
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,700
Bring down the curtain!

439
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,700
Cohan, you're fired! You're canceled.
You're washed up!

440
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,500
You and your whole family!

441
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,300
<i>Oh, things were tough.</i>
<i>But at least I was in New York.</i>

442
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,800
<i>I had a trunk full of songs and play</i>
<i>scripts and a heart full of confidence.</i>

443
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,200
<i>I'm glad I had it.</i>

444
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,600
I'm sorry, I can't use this, Cohan.

445
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:02,000
<i>Youth needs confidence. I'd learned my job</i>
<i>the hard way, all over the United States.</i>

446
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:07,000
<i>Guys who'd never been past the corner</i>
<i>cigar store said my stuff was no good.</i>

447
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,300
<i>A kid had to believe</i>
<i>in himself to buck that.</i>

448
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,600
- What do you think?
- I didn't like it. Didn't appeal to me.

449
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,700
What do you mean it didn't appeal
to you? I'm the senior partner.

450
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,100
- I make the decisions.
- Well, what did you think?

451
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,200
- It didn't appeal to me either.
- Which proves you have no ear for music.

452
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:04,300
He's got no ear for music. I'm the senior
partner. I have a wonderful ear for music.

453
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,200
- The libretto is a grand story, isn't it?
- I laughed all the way through it.

454
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,900
That's my cue. If Harold laughs
then I know it isn't funny.

455
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,300
Why don't you have Mr. Cohan sing?
Maybe you didn't like "Harrigan"...

456
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,000
...because I haven't got much of a voice.
- I think you have a lovely voice.

457
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,900
- Don't you think so, Mr. Dietz?
- Yes. If you'd like a job answering phones...

458
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,600
Are you or are you not going
to produce my play?

459
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,700
If you think I'd put my wife's money
in that trash, you're crazy.

460
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,500
That's it, Mary. That's enough.
They've had their chance.

461
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,900
- Have you an appointment?
- Yes. I'm Sam Harris.

462
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,800
I want to see them
about this melodrama.

463
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
- We don't teach them their business.
- We're busy. We have no time.

464
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,100
You don't know it,
but your days are numbered.

465
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,500
You're making room for the likes of me.
Someday, Mr. Senior Partner...

466
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,100
...you're gonna come to me and
admit you were wrong.

467
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,300
In 20 years of show business, I never
once admitted I was wrong.

468
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,600
- That's his department.
- And your wife's money...

469
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,900
- Excuse me. I have an appointment.
- Who are you?

470
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,700
My name's Sam Harris. I have a
melodrama here called <i>Wildflower.</i>

471
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,800
<i>Wildflower.</i>

472
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,600
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten. Horses.

473
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,100
Oh, and Indians.

474
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,800
Come on. Don't let a couple like that
get under your skin. No sense in crying.

475
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,200
- Buffalo is such a beautiful city.
- Is that what you're crying about?

476
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,700
It's a beautiful city,
but I hate to go back to it.

477
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,900
Don't worry, you won't have to.
I'll show them.

478
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,800
I'm gonna have my name posted and
plastered up and down Broadway.

479
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,900
Now, you stick along,
we'll whip them to a standstill.

480
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,800
- I never really thought of leaving.
- We'll make this business holler for help.

481
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,300
That's what we'll do. They'll all hear
from us. Every one of them.

482
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,700
I'm the senior partner.
I'll do the throwing out.

483
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,100
You don't have to throw me out.
I know the way.

484
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,800
That's the last time I'll
ever bring you a play.

485
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,400
That's my department.

486
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,000
I will take it to Clower and Erlanger.
They don't always think of box office.

487
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,000
- Thanks.
- Too expensive.

488
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,000
Didn't even read the second act. Probably
the biggest forest fire ever on a stage.

489
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,300
I think he's a little upset.

490
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,600
5:30. We'd have done eight shows
by this time in Buffalo.

491
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,400
The juggler just paid
three weeks back board.

492
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,200
Put him at the head of the
table so he doesn't reach.

493
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,200
Where shall I put the magician?

494
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,400
Until he's paid he sits at the foot
of the table with the Cohans.

495
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,200
- Starvation corner.
- And put the goulash at the head.

496
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,300
Keep everything but the noodles and
syrup out of the reach of the Cohans.

497
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,900
Noodles and syrup are just
enough to keep them alive.

498
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,800
Anybody who owes me two month's
board bill I just keep alive.

499
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,700
I don't have to wait on them.

500
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,800
- Good evening.
- Good evening, madam.

501
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,100
Oh, no, no, no.
From now on, this is your seat.

502
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,800
- Oh, thank you.
- And you, master magician...

503
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,700
...you sit over there with the Cohans.

504
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,700
Madame, some day I hope you will give
me the pleasure of sawing you in half.

505
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,400
I just heard today that Hammerstein
was bringing over the Scotch actor.

506
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,600
Harry Lauder at 2500 bucks a week.

507
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,500
Hammerstein's a great showman. A lot
of people have never seen a Scotchman.

508
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,700
Take some goulash, Mrs. Cohan.

509
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,700
Did you have that appointment
with that man about your booking?

510
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,300
Oh, yes. He's gonna give work
to the act any day now.

511
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,100
What happened to that Boston offer?
That was a mighty sweet proposition.

512
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,300
Four weeks' guarantee, $300 a week,
and top billing.

513
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,100
Well, we didn't take it.
You see, it just wasn't right.

514
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,700
Any act that lays off as long as
you have, any offer's all right.

515
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,200
- Butter?
- Thanks.

516
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,600
We just thought we'd rest
a few more weeks.

517
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,500
Yes, my brother's writing some new
material. We're just not ready to open.

518
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,700
You're not fooling anybody.

519
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,700
Everybody knows that you, Nellie and
Josie can get work anytime, any place.

520
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,100
But nobody wants Georgie.

521
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,200
He's made trouble in every theater
this side of San Francisco.

522
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,900
You can't lay off just because every
manager in town has blackballed Georgie.

523
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,100
His family hasn't blackballed him.

524
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,200
We may take a lot of hard knocks and
make a lot of sacrifices...

525
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,800
...but if they want our act, they'll take him
too. We're not breaking up our act or family.

526
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,400
All right, all right. Let the blackballs
fall where they may.

527
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,000
Madame Bartholdi,
champagne for everybody!

528
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,300
- Swell.
- Even if I had it, who would pay?

529
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,900
Dietz & Goff. They're producing
<i>Little Johnny Jones.</i>

530
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,500
- George, really?
- They went crazy about the book.

531
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,700
Dietz said to heck with his wife's
money. He's gonna use his own.

532
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:27,700
Second round of champagne on me, if
you had it. Pass that goulash down.

533
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,200
Oh, George. Think of those billboards.

534
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,300
Book, music and lyrics all by
George M. Cohan.

535
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,000
- Oh, Georgie, l...
- Take it easy, Josie.

536
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,100
There's enough water on the goulash now.

537
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,100
Dad, I'm gonna be tied in rehearsal
for the next few months.

538
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,200
Why don't you and Mom and Josie
take other offers in the meantime.

539
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,400
Well, I hate to see the act split up,
but if you think so.

540
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,400
Oh, sure. Play all that stuff
around Chicago for Sullivan.

541
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:59,500
- The money's good. The jumps are short.
- Good idea. You get tired resting too long.

542
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,200
But it won't be the same going back
on the road without you, Georgie.

543
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,200
We'll be like a carriage
with only three wheels.

544
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,900
But you will admit I was a bumpy wheel.
You'll roll along easier without me.

545
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,400
- No, Georgie, no.
- You will.

546
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:16,200
If there's a part for a bicycle rider, I
used to be known as "venus on Wheels."

547
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,200
I always knew you weren't a cook.

548
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,000
- How's everything going, George?
- Not so good. Not so good.

549
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,900
I've been pounding the pavement
so long my socks have bunions.

550
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,600
- Mac, would you put a head on that?
- You bet I will.

551
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,200
The villain turns and says:

552
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,300
"I'll tell who you are unless
you help me hold up this train."

553
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,200
Think fast. It's due in 10 minutes.
You'll have the audience standing.

554
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,600
I know, I know. The hero helps him.
Gets shot in the leg.

555
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:53,000
- And the girl nurses him back to health.
- No. He gets shot in the arm, not the leg.

556
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,100
- Do you know what happens?
- I won't be in the theater to find out.

557
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,000
I will be on the street watching
a musical comedy.

558
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,400
Before I put $ 10,000 into a show...

559
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,500
...it must have songs, dances,
and a lot of girls.

560
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,900
Women, women. Little rose petals.

561
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,200
The big scene is where the hero saves
the girl from a burning forest fire.

562
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,500
It won't be terribly expensive.
I know where I can get a cheap fire.

563
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,000
You don't need much of a fire.
Just enough to burn that manuscript.

564
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,800
- I've been looking all over town for you.
- What?

565
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
We gotta go to Dietz & Goff
and sign papers.

566
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,500
- Papers?
- What papers?

567
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,600
- What papers?
- I see. You don't want to talk about it.

568
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,300
- You haven't discussed our musical?
- Musical?

569
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,100
- Remember what we promised.
- I haven't said a word.

570
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:39,100
Good. Dietz said it was the best musical
he's read. Even allowed Goff to agree.

571
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,300
When I told him about those 20 ponies
and 20 showgirls all coming...

572
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,200
- Ponies and showgirls?
- Just a minute...

573
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,700
...would you tell me what
you're talking about?

574
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,200
- You got the check?
- Yes.

575
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,800
- That's mine.
- No, no, no. We won't argue about it.

576
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,800
- Glad to have met you.
- That's minor.

577
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,600
- Come on. We can't keep Dietz waiting.
- You are a fine guy.

578
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,700
You have girls up your sleeve, you have
ponies and showgirls and you don't tell me?

579
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,000
- What's it about?
- We gave our word to Dietz.

580
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,300
We haven't got time.
It's about Todd Sloan.

581
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,300
- The famous jockey.
- Yeah. Come on.

582
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,900
Jockey sounds swell.
Just my luck to miss out on it.

583
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,600
Well, good luck, boys.

584
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,400
You forgot your manuscript. Say, before
we sign up with Dietz & Goff...

585
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,900
...I made some change in
the lyric of "Yankee Doodle."

586
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,500
- "Yankee Doodle"?
- You shouldn't have. It was perfect.

587
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,000
You'll like this.
It gives the number added value.

588
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,500
- May I listen a little?
- Think we should?

589
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,300
- Well, I don't know.
- Lf you promise to be quiet.

590
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,200
- I promise.
- All right. Come on.

591
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,300
- There's a piano in the private room.
- "Yankee Doodle." "Yankee Doodle."

592
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:47,200
- Yankee Doodle Candy.
- Dandy. "Yankee Doodle Dandy."

593
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,700
Yankee Doodle Candy.
Thank you. Yankee Doodle Candy.

594
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,800
I have heard enough.

595
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,300
I will never forgive you for trying
to pawn a forest fire on me...

596
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,600
...when you had that musical.
- Yes, but we gave our word to Dietz.

597
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:34,900
I can't understand it. Why is Dietz's wife's
money better than my wife's money?

598
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,400
Why?

599
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,000
Must you give it to Dietz & Goff?
Must you give it?

600
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,100
Well, I don't know. I like Dietz,
but I'm not too fond of Goff.

601
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,800
I'm crazy about Goff but
haven't got any use for Dietz.

602
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,000
Gentlemen, you are in perfect agreement.

603
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,600
- I will give you a check to bind the deal.
- Here.

604
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,800
- Thank you. What's your partner's name?
- I don't know.

605
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,000
What's my partner's name?

606
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,900
Well, don't toy with the kid at a time
like this. Tell him. George M. Cohan.

607
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,400
George M. Cohan. C-o-H-A-N.

608
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:16,700
- And what is my junior partner's name?
- Sam H. Harris. Shake.

609
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,500
- Hello. What should I write?
- Cohan and Harris.

610
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:25,200
Cohan and Harris.

611
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,000
That's it, ladies and gentlemen,
it's all over.

612
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,400
Yankee Doodle let them down.

613
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:22,500
So they'll either pasture him in clover or
have him hauling rubbish in London town.

614
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,300
Women, women. Little rose petals.

615
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,400
It's wonderful. You got them
eating from your hand.

616
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,200
- My congratulations.
- Thanks.

617
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,000
- As long as those critics don't eat my leg.
- Don't worry.

618
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,800
You have a smash hit. It's in the air.
You can't stop anything that's in the air.

619
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,700
All right. On the boat.

620
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,400
Remember, Jones, watch for the
skyrocket. If it goes off, you'll know...

621
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:37,700
...that I've obtained papers that'll prove
you innocent of throwing the Derby.

622
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,800
It'll mean complete vindication. So stick
on the pier and watch for the skyrocket.

623
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,900
Thanks, pal. I'll be watching.

624
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,500
Goodbye, Johnny. And don't worry,
we still believe in you.

625
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:01,300
- Thanks, kid. That'll help a lot. Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.

626
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,900
That was your department!

627
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,400
Is it the robin that heralds the first
breath of spring?

628
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:16,300
How can you think of robins in the
spring when we're freezing in Illinois?

629
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,500
Hey, Jerry. Did you see the way
they're billing you in Waukegan?

630
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:24,500
- Come here. Look at that. Funny, isn't it?
- "Jerry, Nellie and Josie Cohan...

631
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,200
...family of George M. Cohan,
the Broadway sensation."

632
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,400
- Hey, the kid's doing all right.
- Look at that.

633
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:35,800
Well, that's true. He is
the biggest thing on Broadway.

634
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,800
I know, but it ain't right.
We can build our own reputation.

635
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,400
- We'll be billed as The Three Cohans.
- All right. No need to get excited.

636
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:47,100
Don't think I'm jealous of Georgie's
success. Even though I am a better actor.

637
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,800
Of course you're not jealous.
Everybody knows that.

638
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,800
There'll be no stopping George. All he
needs is experience and he'll be a genius.

639
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,700
He mustn't know I'm a better actor.
It might interfere.

640
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,500
Still, it does look a little funny,
George being the toast of Broadway...

641
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,100
...and you folks gathering crumbs
in the tank towns.

642
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:07,600
- Is either of you fellows Jerry Cohan?
- I am.

643
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,200
It's from George.

644
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,400
"Lmpossible to find three clever actors
named Cohan for my new show...

645
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,300
...anywhere in New York.

646
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,800
- Return immediately for rehearsals."
- What'd I tell you?

647
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,800
The four of us back together
again. And on Broadway!

648
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:19,000
Even in the kitchen
you sound like a Tetrazzini.

649
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,800
In Buffalo they say I have a nice little voice.

650
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,800
A lot they know in Buffalo.
In Buffalo they thought I was an old man.

651
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,900
- Well, how do you like your part so far?
- Oh, I like it.

652
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,900
It's small.
I'd be afraid to try anything bigger.

653
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:36,000
You got something on the leading lady,
the best song in the show.

654
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,600
Here it is. It's finished.

655
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,700
- Come on.
- Well, what about the lyrics?

656
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,800
I'm gonna give it to you now.
Sit down and give me a pickup.

657
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:53,800
