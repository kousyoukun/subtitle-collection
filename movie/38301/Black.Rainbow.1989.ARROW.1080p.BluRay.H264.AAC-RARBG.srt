Well...

36
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,510
I can't help you there.
There's no one by that name in these parts.

37
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,590
She was seen in your store.

38
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,050
Maybe you might recognize her.

39
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,180
That's Emily Bowen.

40
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,390
She hasn't been in here in years.

41
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,230
Not one for company.

42
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,270
And she don't like, uh... intruders.

43
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,690
You want to talk to her?

44
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,360
- I do.
- You're out of luck, fella.

45
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,660
Emily can't speak to nobody.

Your eyes, Martha...

55
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,110
They look like they've seen too much.

56
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,990
Don't you remember me?

57
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,040
Gary Wallace, "The Oakville Bee".
I interviewed you...

58
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,670
with your father
before you disappeared.

59
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,050
Ten years I've been tracking you down.

60
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,680
The old fella at the store says
you haven't spoken since you came here.

61
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,140
Folks round here they think you're dumb,
but I know you're not.

62
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,060
I won't be leaving here

63
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,810
until you tell me what happened that night
your father was murdered.

64
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,400
- (Man) Breakfast?
- Are we running late?

65
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,070
What time do you have, ma'am?

66
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,110
Ten after seven.

67
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,030
Six!
You're just one hour ahead.

68
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,240
Ahead?

69
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,490
- Breakfast?
- No.

70

(Knock on door)

71
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,960
Breakfast?

72
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,340
I just had it.

73
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,180
- Uh... medicinal.
- For your liver?

74
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,010
More metaphysical than that -
for my soul.

79
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
Did you have breakfast, Daddy?

80
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,320
Yes.

81
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,080
Well, I see the developers
finally got to Oakville, Eunice.

82
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,920
(Eunice) Surely did, Mr. Travis.
They are ripping our heart out.

83

Worse! It's a lobotomy!

like a plague of locusts. (Laughs)

85

A national lobotomy! Huh!

86
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,340
We'll do this alone, Eunice, OK?

87
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,380
It's a private moment,
you understand?

88
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,050
- We won't be long.
- Fine, Mr. Travis!

89
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,810

90
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,310
Alright.
Let's hear it, baby!

91

101

Won't happen again, will it?

102
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,980
- Never!
- Promise?

103
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,400
I promise.

105
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,670
- Travis.
- Good day, Mr. Travis.

106
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,380
Will that be two rooms?

107
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,430
Certainly it will.

108
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,970
Two rooms were reserved,
weren't they?

109
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,810
- They were, sir. I was merely confirming.
- You're new here, aren't you?

110
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,440
Twenty years
I've been coming to this hotel...

111
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,860
and never before has anybody
ever, ever suggested...

112

- Alright, Daddy.

Rooms 11 and 14.

114

How will you be paying for that?

115
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,200
Like always. With cash.

116
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,250
Would you care to leave a deposit?

117
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,790
No!

118

119
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,510

- No.

120
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,510
Would you like help with your bags?

121
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,810
Are you coming, Martha?

122
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,310

Of course you can, sugar.

- Who was it? Stand up, don't be shy.

181
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,740
You know a little Johnny
who's passed over?

182
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,990
Yes.

183
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,790
- What's your name?
- Rachel Sachs.

184
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,080
Come to the microphone, Rachel.
Don't be nervous.

185
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,380
Remember,
I'm only God's instrument.

186
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,720
A telephone exchange

187
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,680
for those spirits who want to connect
with their folks here on earth.

188
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,560
Sometimes the connections aren't too good.
Sometimes the... signals are weak.

189
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,690
I've... I've lost a Johnny.

190
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,280
A little Johnny?

191
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,450
A baby Johnny?

192
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,490
Yes, his voice is very small.

193
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,830
Was it little Johnny's birthday?

194
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,120
- Yesterday.
- (Applause)

195
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,460
He's about three now?

196
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,710
Yes, he would be.

197
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,880
Yes, I can see him.
He's got black hair.

198
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,760
- Brown!
- Dark brown, almost black.

199
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,060
Yes. He's right here,
he's looking at the flowers.

200
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,150
Yes, you can, Johnny,
darling boy.

201
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,270
He said, "Can I pick some flowers
for my mom?"

202
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,020
- Oh... he wasn't my baby!
- (Audience) Aw...

203
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,990
Yes, but you know his mother!

204
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,860
I didn't say the flowers were for you.

205
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,320
(Audience chuckling)

206
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:41,950
He's... a handsome boy now
over there, spirit side.

207
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,620
Did he have a defect?

208
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,880
Yes.

209
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,460
In his heart.

210
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,260
I can feel it. I...

211
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,800
But he's all healed now, and he's...

212
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,300
He's very happy.

213
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:00,850
Very happy.

214
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,560
(Audience) Aw...

215
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,970
(Applause)

216
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,360
Another voice is coming through.

217
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,450
Tom?

218
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,950
It's hard to understand.

219
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,460
Yes, his accent
makes it hard to understand.

220
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,000
It's a Tom, though...

221
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,920
Tom.
Does anybody know a Tom?

222
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,590
Me.

223
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,300
(Applause)

224
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,970
What's your name?

225
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,970
Mary Kuron.

226
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,020
Yes, Tom?

227
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,940
I... I can't quite hear.

228
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,810
Could you speak slower, Tom?

229
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,360
His voice is...

230
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,070
- It's his accent. It's...
- He's Irish.

231
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,910
He's holding his hands out.

232
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,030
Big hands. Grained.

233
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,830
A working man's hands.

234
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,960
He worked
at the Silas Chemical Plant.

235
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,670
(Audience murmuring)

236
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,630
He says,
"You're not to worry, Mary."

237
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,470
He's alright.

238
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,100
What's he doing with hisself over there?

239
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,890
He says, "I'm doing great over here."

240
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,690
He's very happy.

241
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,150
Not playing the horses, is he?

242
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,980
(Audience laughing)

243
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,360
And drinking moonshine.

244
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,070
No, you can be sure
he isn't doing that.

245
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,950
He says,
"What's got into you, Mary?

246
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,370
"You know I was never one
for gambling or hooch."

247
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,630
Well, Pappy never was strong
with the truth!

248
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,840
(Audience laughing)

249
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,930
He says he learnt to play the guitar.

250
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,300
Did he want to play the guitar?

251
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,970
No, um...

252
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,140
You gotten it wrong, Martha.

253
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,100
It's my husband
that's crazy to play the guitar.

254
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,900
You gotten it real wrong this time.

255
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,900
He's still alive.

256
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,070
- No, he's not!
- (Audience gasping)

257
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,700
He was watching TV
when I left home tonight!

258
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,450
Only an hour ago!

259
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,920
I thought it was my daddy
you was talking to.

260
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,370
Is your daddy's name Tom?

261
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,750
Yeah.

262
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,550
Tom Murphy.

263
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,460
And my husband is Tom Kuron.

264
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,680
But it's my daddy that's dead.

265
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,970
It's not your daddy talking to me, Mary.

266
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,770
Did he die violently?

267
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,110
No.

268
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,400
This man did.

269
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,280
I can feel the impact.

270
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,660
His chest has exploded.

271
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,080
Blood and bone on the wall.

272
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,170
Flock wallpaper.

273
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,050
Do you have a white carpet?

274
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,680
Yeah.

275
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,850
We had it laid last week.

276
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,060
I'll tell her, Tom.

277
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,060
How did you know?

278
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,180
He says...

279
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,810
"Don't worry about a thing, Mary."

280
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,480
His chest has healed.

281
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,610
His ribs are back in place,
his organs.

282
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,320
But Tom's not dead!

283
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,860
I can hear him.

284
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,410
I can hear him playing his guitar

285
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,950
He's very happy over there, Mary.

286
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,210
There's another man with him.

287
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,340
I can see him quite clearly.

288
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,630
Brown hair. Smiling.

289
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,510
What's his name, Tom?

290
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,550
You don't know his name?

291
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,560
I know it, though...

292
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,400
I can see his house in Chicago.

293
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,110
His wife, waving...

294
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,690
Martha, for God's sake!

295
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,070
Something...

296
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,040
Something...

297
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,420
dangling in his hand.

298
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,800
It's a gun...

299
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,470
- (Audience member) What?
- No.

300
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,800
Black gloves.

301
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,970
Black gloves.

302
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,310
Black gun!

303
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,730
No! No! No!

Martha will explain.

311
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,100
What the hell
were you doing out there?

312
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,100
What's up with you?
What got into you?

313
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,440
I don't know.

314
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,570
You wouldn't let go,
would you? (Scoffs)

315
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,240
How many time have I told you

316
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,530
that when you're following
a wrong one, let go.

317
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,580
But no, your arrogance
has to have its way.

318
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,910
It was not a wrong one.

319
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,870
I saw it. All of it.

320
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,460
You "saw it"?

321
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,630
You saw nothing!

322
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,260
Nothing.

323
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,380
I know, remember?

324
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,510
I know!

325
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,720
It's just what you said to Momma.

326
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:17,600
Your mother saw nothing.

327
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,940
You don't still believe
that cock and bull story, do you?

328
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,400
You were with me
in St. Louis, remember?

329
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,650
Hundreds of miles away.

330
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,280
You couldn't have appeared to her.

331
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,990
You know your mother's problem?

332
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,250
- Religion.
- (Chuckles)

333
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,120
Yeah.
Too much religion.

334
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,000
She never did see you
like she said, baby.

335
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,920
It was all in her dreams.

336
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,130
Now...

337
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,560
You must apologize
to that poor woman!

338
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,100
I have her waiting outside.

339
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,560
I'm not apologizing.

340
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,230
You will.

341
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,110
No, I can't!

342
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,400
I saw it!

343
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,530
I saw it, all of it!

344
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,660
You heard what the woman said.
Her husband isn't dead.

345
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,490
She's wrong.

346
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,500
You heard what she said.
He's at home watching TV.

347
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,290
In some households,
that's considered being alive.

348
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,210
Now, now...

349
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:34,340
Yes, you must apologize,
sweetheart.

350
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,260
You frightened the life out of her.

351
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,600
What about me, Daddy?

352
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,690
Why should you be frightened?

353
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,400
You've been doing this
since you were a kid.

354
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,190
It was different this time.
You have to believe me.

355
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,790
Alright.

356
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,460
We'll talk about it
on the train, hmm?

357
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,080
Here.

358
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,920
Right now...

359
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,290
apologize.

360
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,920
Oh, look.

361
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,840
We have to keep them sweet.

362
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,390
We may want to come hack.

363
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,980
Only a few more years,
you know, that's all.

364
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,400
Then we can retire to the land...

365
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
of milk and honey.

366
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,860
Hmm?

367
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,070
One more time, sweetheart.

368
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,330
(TV blaring)

369
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,380
She knew about the carpet.

370
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,630
Weird that was.

371
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,800
And the wallpaper.

372
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,340
She knew about that.

373
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,550
(TV) 'Car A at 166 Western,

374
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,800
'bearing 138 degrees.'

375

'Hey, Cody,
that guy's a copper!

376
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,390
'He's a T-man, I know him.
His name is Fallon.'

377

'Maybe they're waiting
to pin a medal on him.

'A nice gold medal for the copper.'

380
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,980
Coffee?

381
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,990
'Only maybe he's going to get it
sooner than he thinks.'

382
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,110
Yes.

383
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,450
'We've got your boy Fallon in here,
and he'll be alright if you do as I say.'

384
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,870
'You haven't got a chance.
Come out with your hands up.'

385
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,160
'Come out with your hands up,

'Fan out! Fan out!
Give 'em the tear gas from both sides.'

389
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,130
And she said my chest had what?

390
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,550
- (Mary) Exploded.
- 'That was Cody Jarrett talking!'

391
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,930
Blood and bones all over the carpet?

392
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,550
(Mary) Right.

(Gunfire on TV)

394
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,680
That's disgusting.

'Made it, Ma!

396
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,980
'Top of the world!'

397
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,020

shouldn't be allowed...

No.

No.

Tom...

404
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,310
(Siren wailing)

405
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,060
Can we take some shots inside,
Lieutenant?

406
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,560
If you wanna make your viewers throw up,
be my guest.

407
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,360
Thank you.

408
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,780
Alright. Ready? There you go!

409
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,570
Wait a sec.

410
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,450
Can you confirm that Kuron worked
at Silas Chemical?

411
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,330
(Chuckles)
Where else is there to work?

412
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:49,120
- What did he do there?
- Uh, plant maintenance.

413
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,540
Is there a Ms. Kuron?

414
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,830
Yeah, Mary Kuron.

415
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,500
She was in the kitchen
when it happened.

416
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,040
Didn't see anything.

417
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,800
Can we talk to her?

418
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,880
Sorry.
She's sedated.

419
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,640
At the County Medical Center.

420
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,270
I didn't see an ambulance.
We got here with you guys!

421
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:14,480
Listen, kid, when I say she's sedated,
that's what she is.

422
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,020
OK?

423
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:23,110
(Man) Hey, why don't you pan from the blood
on the wall across to the Christmas tree?

424
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,860
Say hi to your mother, Gary.

425
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,240
She's dead, Irving.

426
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,040
Oh, shit!

427
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,750
I saw Amy just last month
up the State Fair.

428
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,750
She's been gone near two years.

429
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,130
How'd I miss that?

430
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,260
Sorry about that, Gary.

431
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:50,010
Could've sworn it was her.

432
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,930
(Police radio, indistinct)

433
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,340
(Siren wailing)

434
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,930
- Yes?
- Gary Wallace, "Oakville Bee".

435
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,270
Can I ask you some questions?

436
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:45,860
- You said you wouldn't, Jack!
- He's not gonna use our names.

437
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:48,160
- Will you?
- Not if you don't want me to.

438
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,030
You see?

439
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,160
You know the Kuron's?

440
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,660
Yeah.

441
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:58,040
- She's Mary's best friend.
- Enough, Jack.

442
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,920
I work down at Silas', where Tom did.

443
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,090
Any idea for motive?

444
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,300
All I'll say is this:

445
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,260
Safety and Health Administration

446
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:16,850
was about to start an audit
at the Oakville plant.

447
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,310
Did he have something to tell 'em?

448
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,400
That's all I'm gonna say.

449
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,570
Tom Kuron worked in maintenance,
didn't he?

450
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,000
He was going to blow the whistle on them,
wasn't he?

451
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,380
About Health and Safety violations?

452
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,470
- I got ya.

453
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,970
Well...

454
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,260
Thanks for the tip.

455
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,390
- That's not all!
- Don't you dare, Jack.

456
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,770
Eva, I've got to.
Mary knows who did it.

457
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,400
She doesn't, you dumb idiot.
She doesn't!

458
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,730
Eva was out with her some time tonight.
They went to see some freaky medium.

459
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,650
- What happened?
- Stop! Don't, Jack!

460
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,990
Please don't!
Something terrible will happen.

461
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,530
Nothing is gonna happen.

462
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,530
Don't be scared, baby.
Nothing is gonna happen.

463
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,080
Hit me.

464
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,540
(Train horn blares)

465
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,510
(Train horn blares)

466
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:37,310
(♪ Country music playing)

467
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,360
Thank you, Shelly.

468
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,580
Like to fuck her, Irving?

469
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,040
I'm a married man, sir.

470
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:06,250
Always knew you were a liar,
but not a hypocrite.

471
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,130
You know what she does for me, Irving?

472
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,010
Always reckoned
that was your affair, Mr. Silas.

473
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,430
Well...

474
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,310
Let me tell you, Irving.

475
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:23,270
I decided not only did I own
chemical plants,

476
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,560
I lived in one.

477
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,070
I decided to record exactly
what goes into me

478
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,280
and what comes out the other end.

479
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,780
Shelly is now taking my urine and stools
from last night to be analyzed.

480
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,120
Isn't that interesting?

481
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,830
- Certainly is.
- (Chuckles) You're full of shit, Irving.

482
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,920
Which brings me to your hysterical call.

483
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,500
I thought you should know.

484
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,760
- Are you being serious?
- I am, sir.

485
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,050
Kuron's wife's gonna give me trouble?

486
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,760
No!

487
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:00,010
It's the medium that could cause you
a problem, Mr. Silas.

488
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,560
She knows what he looks like.

489
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,600
She even knows his name.

490
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,650
Where is she now?

491
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,150
- On the train to Ironsboro.

492
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,780
She has another show there tonight.

493
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:18,200
So... she doesn't even know
what happened.

494
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,120
But Gary Wallace does.

495
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,290
"The Bee" is running with the story.

496
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,290
I'll have to interview her.

497
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,670
Tread water for a while.

498
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,210
Enough for you to contact your man?

499
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,720
He may not take
fortune tellers seriously.

500
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,800
Well, that's his business.

501
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,970
But she sure as shit
predicted Tom Kuron's death.

502
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,140
Reckon Health and Safety'll wanna
take a look at all the other plants, too.

503
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,730
Wouldn't think prison shit
much worth analyzing myself, Ted.

504
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,860
Specially when 3,000 volts
been passed through it.

505
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,830
I'll seek guidance from the Lord.

506
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,000
I'd telephone him right away
if I were you.

507
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,880
(Train horn blares)

508
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,310
Do you read the good book
every day, sir?

509
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,810
Every day.

510
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,860
I smell a preacher.

511
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,240
Is that the profession you follow?

512
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,150
It is.

513
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,410
So, uh...

514
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,240
for you, this is work.

515
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,790
A salesman's manual.

516
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,500
More a source of inspiration.

517
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,960
But also a source of income.

518
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,000
You can't deny it.

519
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,510
I don't.

520
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,510
Tell me, preacher,

521
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,180
what brings you on this journey?

522
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,680
I've been called to a new flock.

523
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,520
"Flock"? (Laughs)

524
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,360
Ironic, isn't it?

525
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,110
That word applies
to both sheep and Christians.

526
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,070
Indeed it does.

527
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,740
Our Lord is our shepherd.

528
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,740
He teaches us... humility.

529
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,910
(Laughs) That's a word I don't trust.

530
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,660
Uh, the reason I'm pursuing
the subject, preacher,

531
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,460
is that you and my daughter, Martha...

532
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,510
have something in common. Mm?

533
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,180
She, too, is interested...

534
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,770
in spiritual matters.

535
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:50,730
- Martha is a medium.
- Lay off me, Walter.

536
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:55,350
Only, Martha has
a distinct advantage over you

537
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:59,480
in the, uh... spirit-stakes,
so to speak.

538
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,740
- Does she?
- Sure.

539
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,320
You, preacher, can only tell your flock
what is written down in the Bible.

540
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,580
"The Word"!

541
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,540
Martha, on the other hand,
is like television.

542
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:16,160
She has a direct line to the dead
that transmits pictures to her.

543
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:21,550
She can offer proof
that there is life after death.

544
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,890
Why, she can even describe
what it's like over there.

545
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,470
Halls of music.

546
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,810
Of literature.

547
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,560
Pizza parlors.
Hamburger hamlets.

548
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,400
Visuals!

549
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,560
Isn't that right, Martha?

550
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,730
Ignore him, Reverend.
He's just mad at me.

551
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,860
I see.

552
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,360
But you are a medium?

553
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,740
- Sure.
- I find that very interesting.

554
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,910
Do you also have
the power of prophecy?

555
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,210
Funny you should ask that.

556
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,120
No.

557
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,000
I can't foretell the future.

558
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,630
Be grateful.

559
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,800
Why do you say that, preacher?

560
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,720
That's dangerous territory.

561
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:07,180
We steal if we touch tomorrow.

562
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,100
It is God's.

563
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,350
(Train horn blares)

564
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,570
- Do you really think she knows who did it?
- (Phone rings)

565
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,940
If she does,
she kept it from Kuron's widow.

566
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:27,490
All she did was apologize and say
it all had been a terrible mistake.

567
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,240
But it wasn't a mistake, was it?

568
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,830
Kuron died exactly as she predicted.

569
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,870
How do you account for that?

570
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,250
If she's trading in futures,

571
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,710
it has to be insider dealing with God.

572
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,340
You're plain cynical, Gary.

573
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:49,260
I am when it comes to supernatural shit
like this, Geoff.

574
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:51,010
Can't deny it.

575
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,430
You don't believe in God?

576
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,020
It's the way my mom and daddy
brought me up.

577
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,900
So any concept of the soul or life after death
is just bullshit?

578
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,240
Did you ask Weinberg
if he's gonna question her?

579
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,360
Yep.

580
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,620
- Laughed at me.
- Oh... did he now?

581
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,500
He said he wasn't going to look a goddamn
asshole interviewing a two-bit medium.

582
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,170
What time does a two-bit medium
arrive in Ironsboro?

583
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,590
Geoff...

584
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,920
Vern'll kill me if I don't come home.
It's bowling night. You know her.

585
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,180
- Frank.
- (Frank) 'Yeah?'

586
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,430
We have to get Gary over to Ironsboro
within two hours.

587
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,840
- Geoff...
- (Frank) 'Well, I'll check.'

588
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:35,470
Get somebody else to cover it, will you?
Like you said, I think it's all bullshit.

589
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,690
That's what makes you so right
for this assignment, Gary.

590
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,560
Your qualifications are impeccable.

591
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,020
What?

592
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,940
You're an agnostic and an asshole.

593
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,570
(Train bell)

594
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:05,380
(PA) 'The Oakville train
arrives on track eight.

595
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,220

00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,280
Let's go, then.

00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,370
- Mm?
- We're here. Wake up.

600
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,160
(Coughs)

601
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,750
Feeling alright?

602
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,500
Maybe it's something you ate.

603
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,300
- I'd delay getting off if I were you.
- Who the hell are you?

604
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,220
Mr. Travis,
I don't want to startle you...

605
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,720
- I said...
- ...but I wouldn't get off just yet, sir.

606
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,140
There's two cops out there,
waiting to interrogate your daughter.

607
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,260
- What?
- I repeat, who the hell are you?

608
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,970
Gary Wallace.
Reporter with "The Oakville Bee".

609
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,640
You obviously didn't see
our headline this morning.

610
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,860
What's that got to do with my daughter?

611
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,150
She predicted it would happen.

612
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,070
My daughter, sir,
is a renowned medium,

613
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,280
not some cheap fortune teller.

614
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:17,830
- Daddy, you know...
- Say not a word, Martha,

615
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:21,330
not a word
in front of the gutter press.

616
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:25,290
Alright, sir,
now show me these cops.

617
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:31,050
(PA) '...five minutes for Raleigh,
Wilmington, Hendersonville...'

618
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:33,260
Those aren't cops!

619
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:37,180
I can smell cops
like I can smell Limburger cheese.

620
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,470
Those are funeral directors.

621
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,520
- Trust me, sir, I'm being serious.
- So am I.

622
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,350
I tell you...

623
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,810
they are funeral directors.

624
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,190
You don't seem to understand, sir.

625
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,440
It's possible that your daughter
is in real danger.

626
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:53,740
Look!

627
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,110
(Chuckles) What did I tell you!

628
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,700
Common undertakers!

629
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,410
Huh-ha!

630
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:05,000
Your story, sir, is as dead
as the occupant of that box.

631
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,920
Kindly leave us in peace.

632
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,170
(PA) 'All aboard. All aboard.'

633
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,180
What's the population
of the world, Pops?

634
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,640
The population of the world
is too many!

635
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,390
Ask your mother,
she's the teacher.

636
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,190
Three billion plus.

637
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,270
That's three thousand million?

638
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,400
- That's right.
- (Phone rings)

639
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,650
How many's too many, Pops?

640
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,610
Too many is one, two,
three and four...

641
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,530
What's the population of America?

642
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,370
- Too many, son, too many.
- Two hundred and fifty four million.

643
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,250
- Hi.
- (Jack) 'It's Jack Callow.'

644
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:48,040
- Now, I asked you not to call me here.
- 'Yeah, I know.'

645
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:49,790
I don't care what the reason is.

646
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,130
- (Girl) Is Daddy going away again, Mommy?
- I don't know.

647
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,170
But he only just got back.

648
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,220
- (Boy) What does Daddy do, Mom?
- (Girl) He works for the CIA.

649
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,680
(Mom) Wrong, dumb-dumb.

650
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,890
- He runs a security company.
- (Boy) What's that?

651
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,890
What? You want me to do
this job for nothing

652
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,350
because some dumb bitch has visions?

653
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,560
'Gary Wallace knows!'

654
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:13,780
Well, then you finish the job yourself,
shit-head.

655
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,280
Damn!

656
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,250
What's up, honey?

657
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:30,500
Ah, some idiot client
trying to get something for nothing.

658
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,880
Forget it.

659
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,800
What does "security" mean, Pops?

660
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:43,260
Well, security means
having enough food and clothing

661
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:46,390
for you and Cindy and Larry and Mike.

662
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,100
And for Mommy.

663
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:51,440
Which car are you taking today, dear?

664
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,400
The Mercedes?

665
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,530
Are you going out?

666
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:58,240
- I may have to.
- (Phone rings)

667
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,880
What room is Mr. Travis in?

668
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,590
The house phone is over there, sir.

669
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:18,590
No, I need his room number.

670
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:23,760
It's a surprise.

671
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,220
Wally's an old friend.

672
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:10,020
Yes, can I speak to
Lieutenant Irving Weinberg, please?

673
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,640
(Woman) 'He's engaged just now.'

674
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:13,440
I'll wait.

675
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:16,730
'I'm putting you through.'

676
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:26,110
God chose Martha to be a link
with loved ones on the other side.

677
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,250
A spiritual telephone exchange.

678
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:38,000
Now, presumably
there can be interference,

679
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:40,300
maybe even crossed lines?

680
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,670
Exactly!

681
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,550
Is that what happened
with Mary Kuron last night?

682
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:49,010
(Chuckles)
Now... that's outta court, sir.

683
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,730
You have to realize that in a young girl,
such powers bring with them

684
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:56,810
a fertile imagination

685
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,480
and the nervous disposition
of a racehorse.

686
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:01,690
(Knocking on door)

687
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,450
(Martha) Daddy,
I know you're awake.

688
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:10,450
Stop giving me a hard time.

689
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,790
Please.

690
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,870
I need to talk to you.

691
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,540
It's no good saying
it's all in my dreams.

692
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:24,010
If you keep on with that,
I'll go crazy, like Momma.

693
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,600
Why won't you open up?

694
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:36,140
I have to talk to somebody.

695
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:40,060
(Door opens)

696
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:44,240
I'm going for some air, OK?

697
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,460
It must be a strange life.

698
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,090
Always on the road,
just the two of you?

699
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:03,130
It isn't a life, Gary.

700
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,460
It's a calling.

701
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:09,800
The precious gift bestowed upon Martha
has a price.

702
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,140
Loneliness?

703
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,600
You were telling me about her mother.

704
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:25,400
She left us when Martha was but twelve.

705
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,700
Does Martha have any friends?

706
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,580
Only in the spirit world.

707
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,250
Gate 18, sir.

708
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:40,460
Name is Davidson.

709
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:43,670
You have a pre-paid return to Ironsboro,
first class.

710
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:48,670
There is a booking for you,
but it's not first class.

711
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,880
First class was fully booked.

712
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:52,390
You got the last seat in coach,
Mr. Davidson.

713
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,770
- There is a delay, I'm afraid, Mr. Davidson.
- How long?

714
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:59,560
We're not sure.
The equipment hasn't arrived yet.

715
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:01,310
What equipment?

716
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:03,610
The aircraft, sir.

717
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,320
Then why don't you just say that?

718
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,110
The aircraft is goddamn late!
In plain English!

719
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,740
Do you have a club?

720
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,830
- Are you a member?
- No.

721
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,450
Sorry.

722
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:18,040
First class and members only.

723
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,080
Gate 18.

724
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,710
(TV blaring)

725
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:33,470
Martha!

726
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,220
Shh!

727
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:38,560
What is it?

728
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:51,910
You could've woken Daddy.

729
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,950
Don't worry about your daddy.

730
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,910
He and I've been drinking all afternoon.

731
00:47:57,830 --> 00:47:59,370
Drinking?

732
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,410
Daddy doesn't usually drink.

733
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:04,000
And you don't usually have strange men
in your room.

734
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:07,000
Are you strange?

735
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,380
Not strange.

736
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,470
Just married.

737
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,180
Can we talk?

738
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,810
Now?

739
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:22,390
I have to bathe before the show.

740
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,810
Hot water puts me in the right mood.

741
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,270
The spirits must like me clean
or something.

742
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:31,780
- Can you believe that?
- Sorry.

743
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,950
I got a problem
with all that spirit stuff.

744
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:36,700
You've never seen me work.

745
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,830
Oh, you can probably pick up
people's thoughts, like in telepathy,

746
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,960
that's possible, but that's all.

747
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:47,000
Your daddy says
you got a fertile imagination.

748
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,880
I think he's probably right.

749
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,300
So you think I'm a charlatan?

750
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,600
If you wish to put it that way.

751
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:01,680
Hey, hey, hey, the light is not on.

752
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,850
Certainly not the green one!

753
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,870
Is this your idea
of a deep and lasting relationship?

754
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,500
That's right.

755
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,710
This way men lie with me, not to me!

756
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:47,140
- (Eunice) 'Hello?'
- Hello Eunice? This is Walter Travis.

757
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:49,900
'Oh, hi, Mr. Travis.
How do you do?'

758
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:54,520
- I need a little, uh... favor, Eunice.
- 'What do you need?'

759
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,450
There's a young reporter
on "The Oakville Bee"...

760
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:02,620
'Oh, my sister purchases it.
I'm going to their Christmas party tonight.'

761
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:05,000
Oh, then you'll probably know him.
Gary Wallace?

762
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,410
'Yeah, I do!'

763
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,550
(Church bells ringing)

764
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,630
I need to know who killed Kuron.

765
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,810
My job depends on it, Martha.

766
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,890
I'm a charlatan, right?

767
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,900
A cheap performer.

768
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,570
A fraud.

769
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:35,820
- A stage act.
- Hey!

770
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:39,320
No one's going to believe me.
Or you.

771
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:42,120
It's as if it never happened.

772
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:46,040
Get outta here. Now!

773
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:51,170
- ♪ Just to behold my savior's face

782
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,540
Ladies and gentlemen,

783
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:33,160
would you please give a very,
very warm welcome to Martha Travis,

784
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:38,760
- the courier to your loved ones.
- (♪ Organ strikes up)

785
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,720
Thank you.

786
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,310
Thank you.

787
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,690
How many of you
have not seen me before?

788
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,820
Did you expect me to float on?

789
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:04,910
(Laughing)

790
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:08,200
Well, I'm not into levitation,
not tonight anyway.

791
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,370
Did you expect me to have
a radio antenna like R2-D2?

792
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:16,040
I'm just a normal person.

793
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:20,010
The woman next door.

794
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:21,420
So don't be afraid, alright?

795
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:25,680
(♪ Organ resumes)

796
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,350
We're going to chew the fat for a while,
until the voices start coming through.

797
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,270
While we're waiting, has anybody
any questions to ask me?

798
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:43,570
When we cross over to the spirit world,
do we still have to work?

799
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,360
(Laughing)

800
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:47,700
Oh, no!

801
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:49,950
We achieve spiritual rest.

802
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,080
We relax.

803
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:55,210
There's no more striving
to keep your head above water.

804
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:57,210
No more cut-throat deals to make.

805
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,960
No more keeping up
with the mortgage payments.

806
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,930
No more competing.

807
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:09,720
So does that mean Heaven's
like a communist country?

808
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:10,850
(Laughing)

809
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,610
If you donate a part of your body
and when you die it's removed,

810
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:22,030
does it affect you
when you enter the spirit world?

811
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,650
Well, I hope not.
I carry a kidney card!

812
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:29,280
Is the concept of time the same
as we understand it here?

813
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:31,740
Time is only a human concept.

814
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:33,700
Something to make things real for us.

815
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:44,970
- It's not too clear.
- (♪ Organ stops)

816
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:46,550
I'm trying to tune in, but...

817
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,060
Some days the signals
are stronger than others. I...

818
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:02,610
In the third row, is there someone
who knows the name of, uh, Butler?

819
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,780
I do.

820
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,990
(♪ Organ resumes)

821
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,710
- Don't be afraid. What's your name?
- (♪ Organ stops)

822
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:21,130
My late sister-in-law's name is Butler.
Was Butler.

823
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,760
Who... who is Susan?

824
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:29,010
Why, that's her.
Susan Butler.

825
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,190
Who's Jackie?

826
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,730
Me.
I'm Jackie Adams.

827
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:48,820
One moment.

828
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:51,200
I can hear you fine, Susan.
Just be patient.

829
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,370
She's very excited.

830
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:57,000
Susan wants to know have you done
any redecorating in your house recently?

831
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:01,170
I just painted my kitchen!

832
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:07,510
Only finished it last week.

833
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:10,260
She says you got in an awful mess,
paint everywhere.

834
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,930
(Laughing)

835
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,970
- I did.
- Susan says, "Stick to cooking."

836
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,950
- Who's Bill?
- My husband.

837
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:35,200
Susan says she's seen him.

838
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,240
Oh?

839
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:39,410
She says...

840
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,710
She says he's alright now.

841
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:49,170
His face...

842
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:54,140
blown completely away
in some sort of explosion.

843
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,720
Bill's face...? (Whimpers)

844
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:01,560
She says he's alright now.

845
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:06,480
He keeps looking in the mirror,
admiring himself.

846
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:11,030
His face is complete again.

847
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,740
She says, "Bill was always vain."

848
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:19,910
But Bill isn't dead!

849
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,120
(Walter) That's alright. Just don't worry.

850
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:29,790
In row eight, a lady in red,
knowing the name of Louis?

851
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:34,470
- Yes. He's my brother.
- (Man) Alright!

852
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:36,140
Yeah! Yeah!

853
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,390
Alright! Alright!

854
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,640
Who's Jimmy?

855
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:43,890
Uh, my older brother.
They were twins.

856
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,100
It's alright.

857
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:47,440
They're together again.

858
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:51,400
They can't be.
Jimmy isn't dead.

859
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:53,030
(Audience murmuring)

860
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,620
No one can tell
who's Jimmy and who's Louis.

861
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,450
They're having so much fun over there.

862
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,500
Jimmy isn't dead!

863
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:06,290
You're wrong!
He can't be "over there".

864
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:12,090
Bill Prior.
ls there a Bill Prior?

865
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:14,430
Yes, he's my son.

866
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,720
Is he alive?

867
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:19,560
Yes.

868
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:24,850
Mike Braddon?

869
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:27,600
Is there a Mike Braddon?

870
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:30,400
Me, uh... I'm Mike Braddon.

871
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,230
What's your job, Mike?

872
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,360
I'm a union official.

873
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,620
Well, K...

874
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,320
Karl Zwimmer.

875
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:40,830
Is there a Karl Zwimmer?

876
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:43,870
Karl's a friend of mine.
He's... he's meeting me later.

877
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,210
(Audience murmuring)

878
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:56,220
Sometimes this happens.

879
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,390
The voices stop.
The dead withdraw.

880
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,480
It's as if they become so disgusted
with what we're doing,

881
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,560
they can't speak to us anymore.

882
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,070
Tonight, they have turned
their backs on us.

883
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,400
I'm sorry.

Why is he in here?

892

Look at me, baby.

893
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:10,040
What's going on in there?

894
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:12,880
What kinda nightmare
keeps exploding in your mind?

895
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,050
Why won't you believe me, Daddy?

896
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:21,180
- Try to describe what you see, Martha.
- Stay away from me.

898

He sits on Kuron's corpse.

I'm only trying to help, Walter.

901

Oh, uh...
listen to what he's got to say.

902
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:35,610
He is a bright guy.

903
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:36,940
Just forget I'm a reporter.

904
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:39,360
After this afternoon...

905
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,490
Get him out, Walter.

906
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:48,950
Get that fucking hack outta here.

907
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:54,790
What happened this afternoon?

908
00:59:57,590 --> 00:59:59,670
- Nothing.
- He was with me.

909
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:02,380
See you, Walter.

910
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:04,550
I'm not family.

911
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,050
Thankfully.

912
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:12,190
While we're talking ethics, Martha,
I think your act is a scam.

913
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:15,440
That's the story
I intend to file tomorrow.

914
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,090
Put that away, Walter.

915
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:46,550
I want you clear-headed,
like you used to be before Mother left.

916

We're at the end of the road.

I can't go on.

918
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:07,950
We've got to.

919
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,160
Why have we?

920
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:23,800
There's something you're not telling me?

921
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,220
Something I ought to know?

922
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:32,470
The bank deposit's alright, isn't it?

923
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:34,940
The shares and everything?

924
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:44,610
My God!

925
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,570
You've lost it all, haven't you?

926
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,580
Where is it? Huh?

927
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,090
Have you been gambling again, huh?

928
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:04,970
Is it a woman this time?
Who is she? Huh? Who is she?

929
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:09,260
My money!

930
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:15,640
You bastard!

931
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:20,270
You've cheated me all my life.

932
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:27,030
You cheated me of my life!

933
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:28,990

934
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:35,580

935
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,120
You're laughing at me!

936
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,840
I can't help it.

937
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,630
I can't.

938
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:48,630
Here, look in the mirror.

939
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:51,640
See your mother's face.

940
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:56,020
Swollen with tears,
confused, stupid, mean.

941
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:00,560
The bitch walked out on me,
and now you.

942
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:04,110
You're full of the same
sweet-smelling garbage,

943
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:06,490
you and your mother.

944
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:10,910
Lynette! Even her name sounded
like a cake decoration!

945

946
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:18,450

- God help me!

948
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,050

950
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:29,300
I can't stop.

951
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:34,300
- I can't go on!
- Yes, you can, Martha.

952
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:36,140
You can go on.

953
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:38,890
Yes... tomorrow.

954
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:41,150
Tomorrow will be different.

955
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:46,730
Tonight out there, you simply
broke the rules, that's all.

956
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:48,650
(Chuckles) Yes.

957
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:51,820

Well...

959
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,200

I'm still at the airport.

963
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,260
Better tell your cop friend
to keep treading water.

964
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:14,430
Relax.

965
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:16,180
I'll be there tomorrow.

Maybe she was right.

01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:01,700
Have you read this?

1064
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:03,620
Never did take "The Bee".

1065
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:05,460
Well, maybe you should, Ted.

1066
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:09,170
The Lord didn't spend all His time
up the mountain, did he?

1067
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:12,090
All buzz, no sting.

1068
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:16,640
You think that because you're a dumb,
arrogant wasp!

1069
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:22,510
Well, as the only Jew in the area,
I know where the nails are going,

1070
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,770
and the crown of thorns,
and the vinegar!

1071
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:28,190
No sting, huh?

1072
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:31,570
They're asking why I haven't
questioned her yet,

1073
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:34,070
and whilst they don't actually
come out with it,

1074
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:37,280
imply negligence
if not possible corruption!

1075
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:41,490
And you don't come out
smelling of ammonia.

1076
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:43,750
You know, Irving,

1077
01:13:43,870 --> 01:13:47,170
I don't believe we're
in the Garden of Gethsemane yet.

1078
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:51,090
I can't tread water any longer.

1079
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:52,710
I have to go after her.

1080
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:55,510
Just pray your man gets there
before me.

1081
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,350
(Phone rings)

1082
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:09,060
Wallace.

1083
01:14:09,770 --> 01:14:12,360
She was right on the button.
He exists alright.

1084
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,990
Yes!

1085
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:15,740
Yes, yes, yes!

1086
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,570
Hold on.

1087
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:25,370
There is one flight a day
from Chicago to Ironsboro.

1088
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:28,750
- Uh-huh.
- 'Yesterday it was delayed, then cancelled.

1089
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,210
'It took off at eight o'clock this morning,'

1090
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:34,460
arrives at 11:37 local time.

1091
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:38,720
His name was not on the passenger list,
but I wouldn't expect it to be.

1092
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:42,140
'I suggest you take Ms. Travis
to the airport.

1093
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:45,020
'The litmus test is
whether she can recognize him.'

1094
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:46,140
Do it right away.

1095
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:49,100
Hope to see you in church next Sunday.

1096
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:17,760
(Knocking on door)

1097
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,800
(Gary) Come on, Walter, open up.
It's urgent.

1098
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:23,010
Walter, where's Martha?
She's not in her room.

1099
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:27,390
"A day of wrath,
and a day of despair and anguish,

1100
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:30,060
"a day of ruin and devastation,

1101
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:32,690
- "A day of darkness and gloom."
- Where's Martha, Walter?

1102
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:37,310
"A day of trumpet blast and battle cry."

1103
01:15:37,690 --> 01:15:39,820
(Groans)

1104
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:44,780
You foul and slimy creature.

1105
01:15:44,910 --> 01:15:49,000
You slid into...
into my confidence...

1106
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:52,130
- Walter.
- I took you into the...

1107
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:55,590
(Slurs) Yes, he laid hands
on my little girl, yes.

1108
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:58,460
- Walter.
- No, man.

1109
01:15:58,590 --> 01:16:00,340
Listen to me, Walter.

1110
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:02,680
Where is she? Walter!

1111
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:07,560
(Siren wails)

1112
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,770
(Man) "I'll bring distress on men

1113
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,400
"that they walk like blind men.

1114
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:20,240
"Hear me today,

1115
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,950
"because they have sinned
against the Lord.

1116
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:25,950
"Today is the day of salvation.

1117
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,660
"Your blood
shall be poured out as dust,

1118
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:30,370
"and your flesh as dung."

1119
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:35,330
(Siren wailing)

1120
01:16:36,290 --> 01:16:39,260
(Man) 'Let the rescue services
have a clear passage.'

1121
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,470
Witch!

1122
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:44,010
You bloody witch!

1123
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,680
Have you come to see
your prophecy fulfilled?

1124
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:51,600
Have you come to tell me
that Billy's alright?

1125
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,230
Alright in there?

1126
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,110
Alright up there?

1127
01:16:57,860 --> 01:16:59,320
Answer me, witch!

1128
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:05,160
You know, if we didn't believe
in all that crap about the hereafter,

1129
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:08,030
maybe we'd pay some attention
to what's going on down here.

1130
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,410
But we only get one shot, don't we?

1131
01:17:12,330 --> 01:17:13,790
And that's the truth!

1132
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:18,630
So tell me,

1133
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:21,380
what is my son doing over there?

1134
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:24,680
Picking flowers?

1135
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:27,300
Playing the guitar?

1136
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:30,310
I'm sorry.

1137
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:32,020
Sorry?

1138
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:34,600
You're sorry?

1139
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:37,400
You get the hell out of here!

1140
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,440
You'll not stay here and gloat over us.

1141
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,350
(Creaking)

1142
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:07,860
Hey, what are you doing, buddy?

1143
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:10,950
I'm here to meet Martha Travis.

1144
01:19:12,410 --> 01:19:14,120
Nobody told me.

1145
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,080
She's been and gone already.

1146
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,000
Maybe you'd better wait
out front, mister.

1147
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,790
Maybe she meant me to meet her
at her hotel?

1148
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:25,130
Who are you, anyway?

1149
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,510
Her brother.

1150
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:29,510
Just in from New York,

1151
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,430
Do you know where she's staying?

1152
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:38,850
Are you giving me the runaround, kid?
This is the third goddamn time!

1153
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:41,020
- (Man) 'Well, I'm afraid...'
- Well, what about Mr. Travis?

1154
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:42,940
- 'He's not answering.'
- Irv, there's someone to see you.

1155
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:46,110
- 'I'll get them to call you back.'
- They'd fucking better, kid!

1156
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:49,150
(Woman) ...male Caucasian,
approximately five foot eight,

1157
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,660
200 pounds, short blonde hair.

1158
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:55,580
You son of a bitch!

1159
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,950
I come in peace, Irving.

1160
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:01,330
Martha Travis has gone missing.
She hasn't been seen since late this morning.

1161
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:03,920
Well, that's great!

1162
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,790
I'll be getting on home, then.

1163
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:08,710
Not so fast, my friend.

1164
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,800
Kuron's killer's in town.

1165
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:13,640
You may have another murder
on your hands.

1166
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,140
You can forget all that shit
about the hit man.

1167
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:17,350
No, I can't.

1168
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:19,350
I have his name.

1169
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:28,570
Am I expected to believe
all this hocus-pocus voodoo crap?

1170
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:32,320
Irving, you're only on page one.

1171
01:20:32,450 --> 01:20:34,280
You haven't heard
what happened last night.

1172
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:09,110
- Yes...
- Is Martha back yet?

1173
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:11,650
- Ah! Hold on a second.
- Shit!

1174
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:13,700
Where the hell is she?

1175
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:16,660
There's a message for you.
"Call your editor."

1176
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:18,950
Uh, how many nights
will that be for?

1177
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,750
- I think we can do that.
- Excuse me.

1178
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:24,210
- Well, no, that'll be alright, sir.
- You have a reservation for me.

1179
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:25,330
Davidson.

1180
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:28,340
Uh, hold the phone.
Be with you in a moment.

1181
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:32,090
Uh, yes, Mr. Davidson,
you called me half an hour ago.

1182
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:33,380
Mr. Davidson...

1183
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:36,890
(Alarm clock ringing)

1184
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,770
(Thunder rumbling)

1185
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:33,860
(Man) OK, up here, Chief.
Want me to stay put?

1186
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:36,700
Yeah, we'll close off
the balcony, OK?

1187
01:22:38,530 --> 01:22:40,490
(Thunder rumbling)

1188
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:46,000
Do you think she'll turn up?

1189
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:49,540
- If she does, will you let her go on?
- Sure I will.

1190
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:51,670
But if I let her go on,
will she want to?

1191
01:22:53,130 --> 01:22:54,960
Just leave her to me.

1192
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:58,630
(Man) OK, over here, Sergeant.

1193
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:01,300
"The trap is set." Period.

1194
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:04,720
"But will the bait turn up?"
Question Mark.

1195
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:06,480
"She left her..."
Hold on! Hold on! Here she is!

1196
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:07,690
Martha?

1197
01:23:08,690 --> 01:23:11,690
- I have to change.
- It's important, for God's sake.

1198
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:14,230
For God's sake?

1199
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,860
- Yours.
- That's better.

1200
01:23:17,490 --> 01:23:18,490
Make it fast.

1201
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:23,830
Tom Kuron's killer is here.
In town.

1202
01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:27,910
- Where's Walter?
- In the hotel.

1203
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:29,540
Couldn't wake him.

1204
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:31,710
Drunk?

1205
01:23:34,630 --> 01:23:36,710
I'm sorry he won't be here tonight.

1206
01:23:38,050 --> 01:23:41,140
I could've told him why we turn everything
into entertainment.

1207
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:43,010
It's so obvious.

1208
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:46,180
It's the only way we can make sense
of the random stupidity of it all.

1209
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:48,520
Martha, you could be killed
out there tonight.

1210
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:50,690
Good.

1211
01:23:50,810 --> 01:23:53,020
(Hubbub of conversation)

1212
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:06,450
(♪ Gospel choir singing)

1213
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:37,980
♪ Just to behold my savior's face

1214
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:42,240

1217
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:00,170
- Good evening, everyone.
- (Audience) Good evening!

1218
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,430
(Thunder rumbling)

1219
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:14,940
I look at your faces
hungry for confirmation and could weep.

1220
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:19,110
There you are, wanting, waiting,

1221
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:22,740
expecting me to provide something concrete
to believe in.

1222
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:29,120
You'd hate me if I told you that when we die,
we return to nothing.

1223
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:33,660
To the exact state we were in
before we were born.

1224
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:36,290
You'd hate me, wouldn't you?

1225
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:37,920
(Audience) Yes!

1226
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:43,250
But if you knew for certain
that there was nothing after death,

1227
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:47,180
that you only had one shot,
as someone said to me this morning,

1228
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:52,350
maybe if we didn't indulge in the arrogance
of thinking we go on forever,

1229
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:56,520
we'd be better people
while we were alive.

1230
01:25:56,650 --> 01:25:58,110
Think of that!

1231
01:26:02,570 --> 01:26:04,440
But you don't wanna think about that,
do you?

1232
01:26:04,570 --> 01:26:06,910
- (Woman) No.
- (Man) Not really.

1233
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:09,330
Nor shall you.

1234
01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:15,370
It would mean my act was a fraud,
wouldn't it?

1235
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:16,500
(Audience) Yes!

1236
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:20,340
But you know it isn't, don't you?

1237
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:22,800
(Audience murmuring in agreement)

1238
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,170
That's it.

1239
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:28,050
You're rational, questioning people.

1240
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:30,550
You're not like the others tonight,

1241
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:33,720
sitting in front of the television
being told what to believe in.

1242
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:38,230
- No one pulls one over you, do they?
- (Woman) No.

1243
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:48,070
(♪ Piano strikes up)

1244
01:26:49,490 --> 01:26:51,030
(♪ Gospel choir sings)

1245
01:26:59,330 --> 01:27:01,670
In the fourth row,

1246
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:04,550
is there somebody who knows
the name Koestler?

1247
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:07,590
Me. Yes.

1248
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,510
(Applause)

1249
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:14,720
Don't be nervous.

1250
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:18,140
Is his name Art?

1251
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:20,650
Yes.

1252
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,070
He's only just gone over,
hasn't he?

1253
01:27:29,030 --> 01:27:30,280
He had a hard life.

1254
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:33,240
He was a coal miner.

1255
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,700
Art says...

1256
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:41,920
"It's good to be out in the light at last.

1257
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:51,760
- "All those years in the dark.
- (Thunderclap)

1258
01:27:51,890 --> 01:27:53,600
"No more bosses.

1259
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,430
"No more work.

1260
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:01,310
"All those years in the dark."

1261
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:18,720
Was his neck broken?

1262
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:21,890
He was on a motorcycle.

1263
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:23,690
(Applause)

1264
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:27,270
(Martha) Yes.

1265
01:29:28,650 --> 01:29:32,070
He said he was on his way home
and never got there.

1266
01:29:33,650 --> 01:29:35,780
Never got to see his mom again.

1267
01:29:39,870 --> 01:29:40,910
Who's Tony?

1268
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:43,710
Who's John?

1269
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:48,210
- Doesn't mean anything to you?
- No.

1270
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:54,340
Who's Walt?

1271
01:29:55,550 --> 01:29:57,470
Not so fast, Walt.
There's a lot of interference.

1272
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,140
I can't hear you properly.

1273
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:00,260
Who's...

1274
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:01,850
(Thunderclap)

1275
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,730
Walt?

1276
01:30:03,850 --> 01:30:05,230
Does anybody know a Walt?

1277
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:08,110
I know a Walter.

1278
01:30:08,230 --> 01:30:09,730
(Applause)

1279
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,780
My husband is... was Walt.

1280
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:15,070
He's on the other side.

1281
01:30:17,070 --> 01:30:18,070
No.

1282
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:22,200
He says he's somebody's father.

1283
01:30:22,330 --> 01:30:24,870
Does anybody have a father
named Walt?

1284
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,420
Over here!
My father was Walt.

1285
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:29,290
(Applause)

1286
01:30:33,050 --> 01:30:36,010
Y-Yes, Walt. Walter.

1287
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:37,430
My father was Walter.

1288
01:30:41,140 --> 01:30:43,270
He said not to worry.

1289
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:45,640
It's alright.

1290
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:47,640
He stopped drinking.

1291
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:52,440
- He had a drinking problem?
- No, he never drank.

1292
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:55,820
He was a Salvationist.
He never touched alcohol.

1293
01:31:08,370 --> 01:31:10,000
No! (Screams)

1294
01:31:11,210 --> 01:31:12,840
Daddy!

1295
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,840
(Screams)

1296
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:18,590
(Audience screaming)

1297
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:20,840
(Martha) Daddy!

1298
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:23,890
Hold it, Jake, it's Barry.

1299
01:31:33,770 --> 01:31:35,480
(Weinberg) Police! Move it!

1300
01:31:35,610 --> 01:31:37,110
Come on, move it!

1301
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:40,490
- Is she OK?
- Get over to the hotel.

1302
01:31:40,610 --> 01:31:42,660
- I'll stay here.
- What?

1303
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:44,830
Trust her, he'll be there.

1304
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:46,370
Go!

1305
01:31:58,470 --> 01:32:00,180
You stole my life.

1306
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:03,510
No, baby, no!

1307
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:09,350
(Mumbles) No, baby, no!

1308
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,190
I'm sorry.

1309
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:14,610
I'm sorry. God!

1310
01:32:17,150 --> 01:32:18,990
Don't let me die!

1311
01:32:19,110 --> 01:32:20,570
I...

1312
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:23,160
(Mumbles)

1313
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:25,450
How did you get in here?

1314
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,290
God!

1315
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:34,290
It shouldn't be happening like that.

1316
01:32:35,130 --> 01:32:38,420
Your mother said
that it's happening to me!

1317
01:32:40,970 --> 01:32:42,180
I didn't believe.

1318
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:45,180
She was right.
Why didn't I believe her?

1319
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:53,150
He's here, is he?

1320
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:57,110
Have you come to save me?

1321
01:33:00,650 --> 01:33:03,030
You have come to save me,
haven't you?

1322
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:15,210
Just one time, baby, that's all.

1323
01:33:21,970 --> 01:33:23,680
One more chance.

1324
01:33:34,190 --> 01:33:35,190
A trick?

1325
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,860
Revenge?

1326
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:42,820
(Martha, echoing) 'You stole my life.'

1327
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:12,680
(Clattering)

1328
01:34:27,870 --> 01:34:28,870
Martha?

1329
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,760
(Breathes heavily)

1330
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:51,100
A dream?

1331
01:34:53,470 --> 01:34:55,480
(Siren wailing)

1332
01:34:57,850 --> 01:34:59,350
Police! Freeze!

1333
01:35:13,990 --> 01:35:16,200
- Walter Travis?
- Uh, room 404.

1334
01:35:16,330 --> 01:35:18,250
Cover the back. I'll go in.

1335
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:32,260
(Elevator bell clings)

1336
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:56,370
Freeze!

1337
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:15,300
You OK?

1338
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:31,570
What about Walter?

1339
01:36:32,910 --> 01:36:34,450
Aren't you interested to know?

1340
01:36:37,490 --> 01:36:38,950
I stayed here with you.

1341
01:36:42,370 --> 01:36:43,580
Go.

1342
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:45,540
Do your job.

1343
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:49,090
I'm fine now.

1344
01:36:50,470 --> 01:36:51,470
You sure?

1345
01:37:07,770 --> 01:37:09,320
Gary...

1346
01:37:14,450 --> 01:37:16,120
He never knew.

1347
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:17,830
Knew what?

1348
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:21,580
If it was a dream.

1349
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:27,130
Gary...

1350
01:37:33,260 --> 01:37:34,510
Martha?

1351
01:37:40,270 --> 01:37:41,560
Martha?

1352
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:49,900
Martha?

1353
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:23,600
- Mind if I use the phone?
- Sure.

1354
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:27,850
Did you see her?

1355
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:30,060
- Yep.
- Sure it wasn't a ghost?

1356
01:38:30,190 --> 01:38:33,480
- None of us has seen her for years.
- So you told me.

1357
01:38:34,650 --> 01:38:38,700
- (Editor) 'Chatwin.'
- Jay. Gary. I found her, but she won't talk.

1358
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:40,620
'So, it's a waste of time.'

1359
01:38:41,740 --> 01:38:45,460
Listen, I got some great photographs.
I can still give you a terrific story.

1360
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:47,540
'Oh, sure,
I'll believe it when I see it.

1361
01:38:47,670 --> 01:38:49,670
'Why don't you take the next plane?'

1362
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:51,250
Right.

1363
01:38:51,380 --> 01:38:52,960
(Phone rings)

1364
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:56,050
You wanted to see me, Jay?

1365
01:38:57,430 --> 01:38:58,800
These just came in from the lab.

1366
01:39:07,890 --> 01:39:09,730
What is this shit?

1367
01:39:11,230 --> 01:39:13,940
Are you on mushrooms or something?
Are you sick?

1368
01:39:14,070 --> 01:39:17,530
Are you drinking too much?
Sniffing glue?

1369
01:39:17,650 --> 01:39:19,280
(Gary) Kudzu.

1370
01:39:19,410 --> 01:39:21,200
Goddamn kudzu.

1371
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:26,910
You know...
we can't kill this stuff, Jay.

1372
01:39:29,370 --> 01:39:31,210
Nothing can stop it.

1373
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Nothing.

1374
01:39:33,130 --> 01:39:35,090
You know, you're going to have to see
the company doctor.

1375
01:39:35,210 --> 01:39:36,300
We'll need a drug test.

1376
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:46,220
Jay...

1377
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:53,730
Gary...

1378
01:39:53,860 --> 01:39:56,070
She's still out there, Jay.

1379
01:39:56,190 --> 01:39:57,530
Somewhere.

1380
01:39:58,860 --> 01:40:00,490
And I'm going to find her.

1381
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:03,370
Maybe not today.

1382
01:40:03,490 --> 01:40:05,290
Maybe not tomorrow.

1383
01:40:05,410 --> 01:40:06,910
But I'll find her.

1384
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:09,330
Now you see me.

1385
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:11,830
