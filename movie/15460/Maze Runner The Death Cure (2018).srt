Of course it was them.

778
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,269
Hey, Teresa.

779
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,033
You shouldn't be here.

780
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,475
If Janson finds out
you're here...

781
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,199
I'm not staying.

782
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:09,956
It's just, uh...

783
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,399
I had to see you.

784
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,872
I have to ask you something.

785
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,839
Do you regret it?

786
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,993
What you did to us?

787
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,560
Sometimes.

788
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,790
But I did
what I thought was right.

789
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,074
I'd do it again.

790
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,755
Good.

the edge off, I see.

792
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,519
Beautiful, isn't it?

793
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,910
Yes.

794
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,672
- It's a lovely city.
- Hmm.

795
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,475
The walls.

796
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,232
It's amazing what people
can accomplish

797
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,471
when their survival's
at stake.

798
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,517
Squeeze them hard enough,
there's nothing they can't do.

799
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,235
No line they won't cross.

800
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,876
You've had a bit of a setback.

801
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:58,912
It's nothing
we're not used to.

802
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,513
Not this time.

803
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,231
The virus is airborne.

804
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,039
It's inside the walls.

805
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,391
That serum
was our last chance.

806
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,237
Anyone not already infected
will be inside of a month.

807
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:22,714
Okay.

808
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,714
We can handle this.

809
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,999
We just need to evacuate
essential personnel,

810
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,799
set up at another safe zone
farther north.

811
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,270
We've still got 28 immunes
right inside this building.

812
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,590
We can find more.

813
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,675
You would.

814
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,479
You'd hunt every last
one of them down

815
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,552
till there was no one left.

816
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,914
In spite of everything
we've done to them,

817
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:51,120
everything we've put
them through.

818
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,994
At least we gave
them the tools

819
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:01,719
they'll need to survive.

820
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,194
Maybe they'll succeed
where we've failed.

821
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,675
Are you really telling me
that you're giving up?

822
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,633
After everything?

823
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,356
It's not about
giving up, Janson.

824
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,080
It's about knowing
when you've lost.

Here's how this is gonna go.

828
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,077
We're gonna ask you
some questions,

829
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:59,640
and you're gonna tell us
exactly what we need to know.

830
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,190
We'll start off simple.
Where's Minho?

831
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,237
You guys don't
seriously think...

Don't look at him.

833
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,679
Why are you looking at him?

834
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:09,910
Look at me.

835
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,358
He's not gonna help you.

836
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,157
Now, we know you have Minho
in the building.

837
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,350
Where?

838
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,997
He's with the others
in holding.

839
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,674
Sublevel three.

840

841
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,960
28.

We don't necessarily need her.

Right?

850
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,994
Not all of her.

That's not the plan.
Back off.
