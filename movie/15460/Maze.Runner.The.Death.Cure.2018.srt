I'm fine. How are you?

90
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,740
他不在
He's not here.

91
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,850
我拿一個
I'll take one.

92
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,390

聽好了
All right, listen up.

99
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,540
我知道你們受盡折磨
I know you've all been through hell.

100
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,210
我也很想說 一切都過去了
I wish I could say our troubles are over.

101
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,180
但一切還沒結束
But we're not through this yet.

102
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,280
實驗部虎視眈眈 不肯放棄
WICKED's still out there. They're not giving up.

103
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,450
因為他們想利用你們
'Cause you got something they want.

104
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,620
他們抓你們是因為
They took you because you're immune

105
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:05,320
你們對一種能夠滅絕人類的病毒免疫
to a plague that's wiping out the human race.

106
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,530
他們認為應該犧牲你們研製解藥
And they think you're worth sacrificing to find a cure.

107
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,130
可我反對
Well, I don't.

108
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,100
所以兩天後
So in two days,

109
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,840
等我們把這艘船改造好
when we get this tub of rust seaworthy,

110
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,570
我們就離開這
we're getting the hell outta here.

111
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,440
去一個
We're gonna go to a place

112
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,640
實驗部找不到你們的地方
where WICKED will never find you.

113
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,940
在那堶奐s開始
A place you can start over.

114
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,550
在那埵w家
A place you can call home.

115
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,620
你們願意嗎
Are you with me?

116
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,350
快上船 開始幹活吧
Come on up here. Let's get to work.

117
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,820

Come on, I need some volunteers.

118
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,220
來吧
Let's go.

119
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,090
開始幹活
Let's get to work.

120
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,760
把板條釘到船上
Let's get these crates on the boat.

121
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,570
我們兩天後就出發
We got two days before we leave.

122
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,840
過來幫我個忙
All right. Give me a hand up here.

123
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,640
有什麼事嗎
May I help you?

124
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,580
看起來還行
It looks good.

125
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,350
好極了
How you feeling?

126
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,480
就隨便問問
Awesome.

127
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,480
我知道 你就隨便問問
I was just asking.

128
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,180
大家都是隨便問問
I know, I know, you're just asking.

129
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,690
別擔心
Everybody's just asking.

130
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,890
如果感染了
Don't worry. When I Crank out,

131
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,160
我第一個告訴你 行嗎
you'll be the first to know, okay?

132
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,630
給你 喝點吧
Here, drink this.

133
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,480
你們怎麼這麼久才來
Took you guys long enough to rescue us.

134
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,140
總算見到你了 夥計
It's good to see you, too, bud.

135
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,550
怎麼回事
So what happened?

136
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,250
我反擊了
I fought back.

137
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,780
我們嘗試過了
Tried to, anyway.

138
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,820
能找到我們不容易
You're lucky you found us at all.

139
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,720
他們到處轉移我們
They had us on the move a lot.

140
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,420
好像內部出了什麼事
It felt like something big was happening.

141
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,330
知道他們要去哪兒嗎
Any idea where they were heading?

142
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,230
我只知道
All I know is

143
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,130
他們經常提及一座城市
they kept talking about a city.

144
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,940
我覺得 現在應該已經沒有城市了吧
I didn't think there were any cities left.

145
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,340
是沒什麼城市了
That's because there aren't.

146
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,880
就算有也是廢墟
Not still standing, anyway.

147
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,350
好了 等等 米諾在哪
Okay, wait. What about Minho?

148
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,880
他怎麼不在火車上
Why wasn't he on the train?

149
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,260
抱歉 托馬斯
I'm sorry, Thomas.

150
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,600
他之前在
He was.

151
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,640
他們帶走了四五十個人
They got 40, maybe 50 kids.

152
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,240
具體數字還在統計
We're still compiling an official count,

153
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,370
飛行員看得很清楚
but the pilot got a good look.

154
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,710
應該是他們
He thinks it was them.

155
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,210
當然是他們
Of course it was them.

156
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,010
飛行器呢
What about the Berg?

157
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,210
我們追蹤了幾英里
We tracked it a few miles.

158
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,510
但他們拆了定位器
But someone must have known about the locator.

159
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,880
不見蹤影了
They're totally off the grid.

160
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,220
快走 免疫者
Move it, Immunes.

161
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,950
C22.

162
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,190
B9.

163
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,360
我們還在搜索附近區域
We're searching the area,

164
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,760
但是他們可能早就離開了
but they're probably long gone by now.

165
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,830
不會 他們哪兒都不會去的
Oh, no, they're not going anywhere.

166
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,540
他還沒救走最想救的人
He didn't get what he really wanted.

167
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,640
這 就這
There, that's it.

168
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,880
大概幾百英里遠
It's a few hundred miles.

169
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:07,880
根據火車線路
Based on the railways,

170
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,810
和阿里斯提供的消息
everything that Aris told us,

171
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,580
他們肯定是要去這
that's gotta be where they're headed.

172
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,050
帶米諾去這
That's where they're taking Minho.

173
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,220
我們帶上所有人
We take everyone who can fight.

174
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,220
沿路追蹤下去
Follow the roads where we can.

175
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,490
一周內就能回來
We can make it back within a week.

176
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,560
一周
A week?

177
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,700
我們花了六個月才走到今天這一步
It took us six months to get here.

178
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,300
現在我們已經有100多人了
We got over 100 kids here now.

179
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,130
我們不能一直留在這
We can't just hang out here forever

180
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,000
畢竟鬧出了大動靜
after what we just pulled.

181
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,430
你在地圖上
You wanna wander off

182
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,970
隨便指個地方就說要去
to some random point on the map.

183
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,240
你都不清楚那堛滷〞p
You don't even know what's there.

184
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,770
我知道
I do.

185
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,410
那是幾年前了
It's been a few years,

186
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,910
但我去過
but I've been there.

187
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,350
最後的城市
The Last City.

188
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,590
實驗部這麼叫它
That's what WICKED called it.

189
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,790
那堿O他們的大本營
It was their whole base of operations.

190
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,290
如果那座城市還在
If that city is still standing,

191
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,660
你最好離它遠點 夥計
that's the last place you wanna go, hermano.

192
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,000
那就是個狼窩
That's the lion's den.

193
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,730
我們什麼沒闖過
It's nothing we haven't done before.

194
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,300
對 但需要周密的計劃
Yeah, with months of planning,

195
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,340
準確可靠的情報 行動要隱秘
and reliable information, the element of surprise,

196
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,540
可現在這些要素都不具備
none of which we have now.

197
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,910
文斯 我想好了
Vince, I've thought this through.

198
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:11,810
你能聽我說完嗎
Would you just hear me out?

199
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,180
上次我們沒準備好就行動
The last time we went off half-cocked...

200
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,810
我失去了一切
I lost everything.

201
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:15,980
你還記得嗎
You remember that?

202
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,650
我知道要救米諾 好嗎
Look, I know it's Minho. All right?

203
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,520
但我不能不顧這些孩子的安危
But you can't ask me to put those kids

204
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,030
去救他一個
on the line for one man.

205
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,660
我做不到
I won't do it.

206
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,970
搜索該區域
Searching the grid now.

207
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,840
A區完畢
A is completed.

208
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,840
開始搜索B區
Scanning B-sector now.

209
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,870
糟了 快關燈
Shit. Hit the lights.

210
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,010
快走 快走
Let's go, let's go!

211
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,330
天哪 他們找過來了
Jeez, they're getting close.

212
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,800
說對了
You're right.

213
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,040
不能留在這
We can't stay here.

214
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,650
你這是要去哪兒
Where do you think you're going then?

215
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,250
紐特
Newt...

216
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,520
你別多說了
Don't be a twat about it.

217
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,960
我也一起
I'm already in.

218
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,490
走吧
Come on.

219
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,360
不 這次不行
No. No, not this time.

220
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,460
聽我說
Look,

221
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,660
就算我們找到米諾
even if we find Minho,

222
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,970
也未必能安全地逃出來
there's no guarantee we make it back from this.

223
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,700
那你就更需要幫手了 不是嗎
Well, you'll need all the help you can get then, won't you?

224
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,310
我們一起死堸k生
Well, we started this together.

225
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,920
現在也要一起去救他
May as well end it that way, too.

226
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,590
好吧
Okay.

227
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,790
一起去救他
Let's go get him back.

228
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,470
不不
No.

229
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,170
等等
Hey!

230
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:32,810
等等
Hey!

231
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,840
等等
Hey! No, no, no. Wait. Hey!

232
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,880
沒事的
Hey, wait, wait! Hey, it's okay! Hey!

233
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,320
他情況怎樣
How's he doing?

234
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,050
呼吸狀況還不錯
Breathing levels look strong.

235
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,000
不
Oh, shit!

236
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,360
不
No! No!

237
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,620
雖然效果不如迷宮
It's not as effective as the maze,

238
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,750
但似乎也有作用
but it seems to be working.

239
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,750
那就好
It's promising.

240
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,460
但我們還需要更多的試驗品
But we'll need a larger sample to work with.

241
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,730
明白了
All right.

242
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,830
繼續
Carry on.

243
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,380
不  不  不
No! No!

244
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,790
你想讓我們通過那
You want us to go in there?

245
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,830
我也不想說這種嚇人的話
I don't wanna come across as too negative,

246
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,900
但這堨i是狂客
but if I was a Crank,

247
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,240
最喜歡出沒的地方
that's exactly where I would be.

248
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,470
但我們現在別無選擇
I don't think we have much of a choice.

249
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,220
那走吧 我坐副駕
All right. I get shotgun.

250
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,000
我們進來了
Well, here we go.

251
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,440
好 小心 開慢點
Yeah, just take it nice and slow.

252
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:00,200
沒事 只有一個
It's okay. It's just one,

253
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,770
那就慢慢開繞過他
so take it slow, go around him.

254
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,540
不要緊的
We'll be fine.

255
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,910
慢慢開
Take it slow.

256
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,280
慢慢開
Take it slow.

257
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,320
求求你
Please.

258
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,950
求求你
Please.

259
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,660

00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,090
求求你
Please.

261
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,260
求你了 讓我進去
Please! Let me in.

262
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,870
好了 煎鍋 不要停
- Okay. Fry, we gotta go. - Please! Open the door.

263
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,470
求你了 繼續開
- You need to go right now! - Why won't you open it?

264
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,800
快踩油門 煎鍋
Just floor it, Fry!

265
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,340

- Come on, Fry, shake him! - I'm trying!

267

快
Go.

268
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:01,630
坐穩了
Hang on!

269
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:04,570
天哪
Oh, God.

270
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,500
煎鍋 小心
Frypan, watch out!

271
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,590

我的手
My hand.

274
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,460
煎鍋 閉上眼睛
Fry, cover your eyes.

275
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,160
見鬼 你沒事吧 沒事 你呢
Oh, shit. You okay, man?

Wait! Thomas!

278
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,940
托馬斯 車門
Thomas, the door!

279
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,980
你能出來嗎
Can you get out?

280
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,450
見鬼 好了 能出來嗎
Oh, shit. All right.

281
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,850
紐特 沒事吧   煎鍋 去那邊
- Newt, you all right? - Fry, go around.

282
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,390
我想辦法出去
I'm trying to get out.

283
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,560
紐特 你沒事吧
Newt, you okay?

284
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,220
我沒事
Yeah, I think so.

285
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,300
煎鍋 沒事啊
Fry, you good?

286
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,930
見鬼
Oh, shit.

287
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,200
煎鍋 我們得趕緊走
Frypan, I think we gotta move.

288
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,410
快 等一會

Come on, what are you doing? We gotta move! Come on!

291
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,080

- Come on! - Hold on!

292
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,640
煎鍋 快走 快啊 等等
- Frypan gotta go! Come on! - Wait!

293
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:25,690
快點
Come on!

294
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,550
打得好 煎鍋 謝謝
- Nice shot, Fry. - Thanks.

295
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,690
好了 我們快走
Okay. We gotta go.

296
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,500
走 走
Go, go!

297
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,300
煎鍋 快啊 快走
Fry, come on, let's go!

298
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,500
煎鍋 我們走 快走 快 快
- Fry, let's move, let's go! - Go! Go! Go!

299
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,140
小心
Watch out.

300
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,010
煎鍋 能搞定嗎 能
- Fry, you got any left? - Yeah!

301
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,580
好的 這邊 這邊
Okay. This way, this way!

302
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,580
行了 另一邊 另一邊
Okay, Fry. Other way, other way!

303
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,430
沒子彈了
I'm out!

304
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,760
見鬼
Shit!

305
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,140
快進來
Hey, get in!

306
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,870
快 豪爾赫 快 快
- Go, Jorge, go! - Go!

307
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,080
挺住
Hang on!

308
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,390
真不簡單
I'm impressed!

309
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,400
你們撐了差不多一整天
You guys almost lasted a whole day.

310
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,840
沒事吧 沒事
- You good? - Yeah.

311
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:00,280
抱歉 連累你們也跟著冒險
I'm sorry. I didn't wanna bring you guys into this.

312
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:03,980
我覺得他想說
I think what he's trying to say

313
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,580
謝謝你救了我們
is thanks for saving us.

314
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,620
不用客氣
You're welcome.

315
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,450
別高興太早
Hey, don't get your hopes up.

316
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,520
那邊的關卡
That checkpoint back there,

317
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,920
是這座城的最後的防線
that was the city's last defense.

318
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,330
如果那媥D到突破 這座城將在劫難逃
If that was overrun, chances are the city is, too.

319
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,230
是的 除非他們能想到
Yeah, unless they figured out

320
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,500
別的辦法把狂客阻擋在外面
some other way to keep the Cranks out.

321
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,650
有意思
Funny...

322
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,090
我們關在堶惜F三年
Spent three years trapped behind walls,

323
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,220
拚命逃了出來
trying to break out,

324
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,560
現在卻又要衝回去
and now we wanna break back in.

325
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,760
是啊 太諷刺了
Yeah. It's hilarious.

326
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,170
豪爾赫 我們該怎麼進去
Jorge, how do we get in?

327
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,900
別問我 兄弟
Don't look at me, hermano.

328
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,800
那些牆是新建的
Those walls are new.

329
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,610
實驗部最會這一招了
I guess that's WICKED's answer for everything.

330
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,750
站在這可沒法弄清楚
Well, we ain't gonna figure it out from up here.

331
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,280
出發吧
Let's go!

332
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,200
你真的覺得他在那
You really think he's in there?

333
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,930
去了就知道了
I guess we'll find out.

334
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,240
你知道特瑞莎應該也在那塈a
You know she's gonna be there, too.

335
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,200
我們想要的一切 必須確保有足夠的資源
We just have to make sure we have the resources.

336
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,410
我再聯繫你 很抱歉
And I'll keep in touch. Excuse me.

337
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,880
準備好了
Are you ready?

338
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,010
沒事的
It'll be fine.

339
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:17,810
大家已經開始喪失信心 博士
People are beginning to lose faith, Doctor.

340
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:20,320
當初你封閉圍牆時 你向我們保證
When you sealed off the walls, you assured us

341
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,450
那只是臨時預防措施
that it would only be a temporary precaution.

342
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,590
為什麼現在還沒有解禁
Why have you now denied all entry?

343
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:29,930
因為情況有變 情況惡化了
Because things are changing. And not for the better.

344
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:32,730
感染率上升了百分之三百
Infection rates were up 300%.

345
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,600
幸運的是
Fortunately,

346
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,400
我們技術上可能就要迎來突破了
we may be on the verge of a breakthrough.

347
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,500
這就是A7號實驗體
This is Subject A7.

348
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:46,440
他之前在迷宮堳搕F三年多
He spent over three years in the Maze Trials.

349
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:49,810
而且他體內產生的抗體
The antibodies produced in response

350
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,680
是我們見過最強的
have been the strongest we've ever seen.

351
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,020
我們正在提取一種新型血清
We're extracting a new serum as we speak.

352
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,350
如果你們同意的話
And with your support,

353
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,560
我們就可以展開人體實驗
we'd like to begin human trials.

354
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:05,230
謝謝你 博士 很不錯
Thank you, Doctor. That is very impressive.

355
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,000
但我們已經試過這種方法了
But we have been down this road before.

356
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:11,800
坦白地說 我們都開始懷疑...
Frankly, we are all beginning to wonder if...

357
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,040
我們的資源是否應該用於別的地方
If our resources couldn't be better spent elsewhere.

358
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,770
- 你是說 - 建立安全區
- Meaning? - Safe zones.

359
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,210
建和這一樣的保護區
Protected areas like the one we're in.

360
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,910
這樣我們能盡可能救更多的人
We could save as many people as possible.

361
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,350
能救多少
How many?

362
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,790
一千個
A thousand?

363
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,920
兩千個
Two thousand?

364
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,290
你能保證這些安全區
And that's assuming your protected areas

365
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,220
就一定安全嗎
stay protected,

366
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,890
你知道這是不可能的
which we know they won't.

367
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,730
被感染的人數已經是健康人數的三倍
The infected already outnumber the healthy three-to-one.

368
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:46,370
安全區只能延緩死亡的到來
All you'd be doing is delaying the inevitable.

369
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,740
你們有沒有親人因病毒感染而亡
Have any of you ever lost someone to the virus?

370
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,980
我侄女
A niece.

371
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,020
安娜
Anna.

372
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,950
很抱歉沒能幫到她
I'm sorry we weren't able to help her.

373
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:05,460
但試想 如果我們能戰勝這種病毒
But imagine if we were able to live with the virus.

374
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,430
活了下來
To survive it.

375
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,630
試想 你當時可以告訴安娜
Imagine being able to tell Anna

376
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:15,370
你能讓她過上正常的生活
that you could give her the chance to live a normal life.

377
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:19,470
我們現在已經無比接近解藥研製成功了
We've never been this close to a cure.

378
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,840
我們犧牲了很多才走到這一步
And we've sacrificed a lot to get this far.

379
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,580
請不要
Please,

380
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,680
讓這些犧牲付諸東流
don't let those sacrifices be for nothing.

381
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,660
做的不錯
Nicely done.

382
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:50,570
他們不好說話 你表現得非常好
They can be a tough crowd. You handled them perfectly.

383
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,440
延緩死亡的到來
"Delaying the inevitable."

384
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,580
托馬斯以前經常這樣說我們
Thomas used to say the same about us.

385
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,450
你還經常想他嗎
Do you still think about him?

386
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,420
我可以幫助你刪除記憶
I can help you with that, those memories.

387
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,450
沒必要揪著過去不放
There's no reason to keep holding on to them.

388
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,120
刪掉就行了
It's a simple procedure.

389
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,860
我不想刪掉是有原因的
There is a reason.

390
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,030
我想記住
I want to remember.

391
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,530
找到解藥
If we find a cure,

392
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,440
所有的付出才值得
that's the only way all this was worth it.

393
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,980
但願你是對的
I hope you're right.

394
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,330
這堹}壞的很嚴重
This place has really gone through hell.

395
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,670
我們不要走散了
We just gotta stay together.

396
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,030
我們是那些
We are the voice

397
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,800
無聲者的代言人
of the voiceless!

398
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:02,610
而他們藏在高牆之內
They hide behind their walls,

399
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:05,610
還幻想著可以獨佔解藥
thinking they can keep the cure for themselves,

400
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:10,450
然後看著其他人慢慢地死亡 腐爛
while they watch the rest of us wither and rot!

401
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:12,450
但我們的人數
But there are more of us

402
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,920
比他們多得多
than there are of them.

403
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,380
我提議 大家站起來
And I say,

404
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,250
拿回屬於我們的東西
we rise up

405
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,420
讓我們一起
and take back what is ours!

406
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:23,560
奪取勝利吧
Let's bring back a victory!

407
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,150
去通知詹森
Get Janson.

408
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:56,860
讓我們進去
Let us in!

409
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,930
就是那兒 從那兒進去
That's it. That's our way in.

410
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,500
讓我們進去
Let us in!

411
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,870
讓我們進去
To the wall!

412
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:08,270
讓我們進去 我要進去
Let us in! Let us in! Let us in!

413
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,040
托馬斯
Thomas!

414
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,910
應該不是這個地方
This is not what you're looking for.

415
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,640
這麼多人拚命想進去
All these people trying to find their way in,

416
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,610
你覺得你能有新發現嗎
you think you're gonna find something they can't?

417
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,950
走了這麼遠 我不想現在回頭
Came this far. I'm not turning back now.

418
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,990
我們怎麼捲進了這種事
What the hell did we get ourselves into?

419
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,670
快點走啊 給我讓開
Get out of my way! Get out of my way!

420
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:40,770
托馬斯 我感覺不太對
Thomas, this doesn't feel right.

421
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,240
你說對了 先生
You were right, sir.

422
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,310
無人機剛剛在牆外發現了他
The drone sweep picked him up outside the walls.

423
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:50,280
準備開火
Get the guns online.

424
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:23,680
各位 我們得走了 快看
Hey, guys, we gotta go now. Look.

425
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,910
快走 我們走 快啊 我們走
Let's go, let's go!

426
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,610
托馬斯 我們走
- Thomas, let's go. - We gotta get out of here!

427
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,180
我們離開這 快走
Let's go! Let's go!

428
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,980
快離開這 托馬斯
Go! Go! Go! Come on!

429
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,420
快點
Go! Keep going!

430
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,690
快跑
Come on!

431
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,660
快跑
Move!

432
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:18,540
躲起來 進來
Come on! Get in! Get in!

433
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,170
快點 他們來了 快
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

434
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,040
快點 跑
Come on!

435
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,810
- 沒路走了 - 快
- No way out! - Come on!

436
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:27,510
快點 紐特
Newt! Newt!

437
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,720
把手給我拿開
Get your hands off of me!

438
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,620
不 布倫達
No! Brenda!

439
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,220
布倫達
Brenda! Brenda!

440
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,160
快 快
Go, go, go!

441
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,860
放開我
Get off me! Get off me!

442
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,640
派人出去找
Send out a patrol.

443
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,280
找不到那小子就別回來了
Tell them not to come back until he's found.

444
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,990
我們走
Let's go!

445
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,180
都出來
Get out!

446
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,400
你想去哪兒
Where you going?

447
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,330
她在哪兒 你個混蛋
Where is she, you son of a bitch?

448
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,060
見鬼 住手 住手
Shit! Hey! Wait!

449
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,300
好了 好了 行了
Come on, come on, come on.

450
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,430
我在這
I'm right here. I'm right here!

451
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:53,230
行了
- Okay, okay, okay. - All right. Okay.

452
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,570
我在這
I'm right here. I'm right here!

453
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:55,700
布倫達
Oh, Brenda.

454
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,770
你們別緊張
Everybody relax.

455
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:58,540
我們是同一戰線的
We're all on the same side here.

456
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,410
什麼同一戰線的 你到底是誰
What do you mean same side? Who the hell are you?

457
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:14,390
菜鳥
Hey, Greenie.

458
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,890
蓋
Gally?

459
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,270
不可能
No way.

460
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,740
不 等等
No, wait!

461
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,470
住手
Hold!

462
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,810
住手 沒事的
Stop! It's all right!

463
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:35,880
行了 住手 別打了
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop! Stop it!

464
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,570
住手
Stop.

465
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:41,110
- 他殺了查克 - 對 我知道
- He killed Chuck. - Yeah, I know.

466
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,080
我記得 我當時也在場 好嗎
I remember. I was there too, all right?

467
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,350
但我也記得
But I also remember that he was stung

468
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,160
他當時被怪物咬了神志不清
and half out of his mind.

469
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:52,460
先冷靜下來 好嗎
Just calm down. All right?

470
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,530
拜託
Come on.

471
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:06,110
就猜到會這樣
Kind of had that coming.

472
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,840
還有誰 煎鍋 紐特
Anybody else? Fry? Newt?

473
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,210
你認識這個人
Do you know this guy?

474
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,350
老相識了
He was an old friend.

475
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,590
怎麼會
How?

476
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,290
這怎麼可能
How is this possible?

477
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,890
我們看到你死了
We watched you die.

478
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:25,790
不 你們丟下我等死
No, you left me to die.

479
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:27,760
如果我們剛才沒找到你們
And if we hadn't found you when we did,

480
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,030
你們早就死了
you'd be dead right now.

481
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,240
你們來這幹什麼
What the hell are you doing here?

482
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,440
米諾
Minho.

483
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,740
實驗部抓了他
WICKED has him here.

484
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,080
我們在想辦法進去
We're looking for a way in.

485
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:46,480
我可以幫忙
I can help with that.

486
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:50,950
跟我來
Follow me.

487
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:53,150
我不會跟你去任何地方
I'm not going anywhere with you.

488
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:56,190
隨你的便吧
Suit yourself.

489
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,490
但我能帶你們進去
But I can get you through those walls.

490
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:09,600
離開迷宮後 一群前往城市的人
After the maze, I got picked up by a group

491
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,370
把我給救了
headed to the city.

492
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:14,240
他們發現我是免疫者
They realized I was immune, patched me up,

493
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,610
就帶我來這 交給了勞倫斯
and they brought me here to Lawrence.

494
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:19,280
實驗部控制城市後
This group's been at war with WICKED

495
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,920
這個組織就在和他們抗爭
ever since they took control of the city.

496
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,480
實驗部不可能永遠躲在牆後
But WICKED can't hide behind those walls forever.

497
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,050
總有一天
Day's gonna come, and they're gonna pay

498
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,690
他們會付出代價的
for what they've done.

499
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,060
聽好
Listen, uh,

500
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,930
他平時很少見外人
he doesn't get a lot of visitors.

501
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:41,140
所以 我來和他交談 好嗎
So, let me do the talking. All right?

502
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,040
別盯著他看
And try not to stare.

503
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,140
玫瑰香氣如此甜蜜
Rose took my nose, I suppose.

504
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:52,240
甜蜜 甜蜜 玫瑰香氣
Rose took my nose, I suppose.

505
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:55,050
如此甜蜜
Suppose, suppose, took my nose...

506
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,020
如此甜蜜
I suppose.

507
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,360
蓋
Gally,

508
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,960
你安全回來了就好
glad to see you made it back.

509
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,030
賈思珀都告訴我了
Jasper told me what happened.

510
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,260
那是一場屠殺
It was a slaughter.

511
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:11,530
我們抵擋不了那些重型武器
There's nothing we could do against those guns.

512
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,270
對
No,

513
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:17,200
他們既然膽敢捅馬蜂窩
but they can only poke the hornet's nest so long

514
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:19,070
就等著被蟄吧
before they get stung.

515
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,780
這些人是誰
Now, who are these people?

516
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,650
為什麼來這
Why are they here?

517
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:28,020
我們要進實驗部
We need to get into WICKED.

518
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,450
蓋婸“A能幫我們進去
Gally said you can get us through the walls.

519
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,820
蓋 你要學會一點
Gally should know better than to make promises

520
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:38,430
不要許下兌現不了的承諾
that he can't keep.

521
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:46,340
高牆不過是第一道難關
Besides, that wall is only half your problem.

522
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,270
混入實驗部基本不可能
Getting inside WICKED is impossible.

523
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:52,340
現在應該有個辦法了
There might be a way now.

524
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,010
但是沒有托馬斯就做不到
But it doesn't work without Thomas.

525
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:00,750
是這樣嗎
Is that so?

526
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:05,450
知道我是誰嗎
Do you know what I am...

527
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:08,190
托馬斯
Thomas?

528
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,500
我是一個生意人
I am a businessman.

529
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:23,540
所以我絕不會去冒不必要的風險
Which means that I don't take unnecessary risks.

530
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:26,310
我為什麼要相信你
Why should I trust you?

531
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,310
因為我能幫你
'Cause I can help you.

532
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:33,080
如果你能幫我穿過高牆
You see, if you can get me through those walls...

533
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:35,820
我就給你想要的
I can get you what you need.

534
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:40,660
你覺得我想要的是什麼
What is it that you think I need?

535
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,420
時間
Time.

536
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,290
每分每秒
Every last drop.

537
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,400
這就是我想要的嗎
Is that what I need?

538
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:58,510
實驗部有我們想要的
WICKED has something we both want.

539
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,550
那這樣吧
I'll tell you what.

540
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:06,910
你們進去兩個人
Two can go for now.

541
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,390
其他人和我待在這
The rest stay down here with me.

542
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,650
只是為了確保
Just a little insurance to make sure

543
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,690
你會老老實實地回來
you find your way back.

544
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,700
成交嗎
We have a deal?

545
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:34,580
蓋 給他帶路
Gally, show him the way.

546
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:47,620
小心點 托馬斯
Be careful, Thomas.

547
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:53,860
蓋 照顧好他們倆
Gally, take care of these two.

548
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,160
好
Yeah.

549
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:14,750
太噁心了
This is gross.

550
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:15,820
天哪
Jesus.

551
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:19,520
是啊 太棒了
Yeah, this is great.

552
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:31,840
跟著我 還要走很遠
Stay with me. We got a ways to go.

553
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:46,420
準備好了
We're ready.

554
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:02,730
夏安
Shai?

555
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:08,140
特瑞莎女士
Hi, Miss Teresa.

556
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,410
感覺怎麼樣
How are you feeling?

557
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,650
還好
Okay.

558
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:23,850
這能讓我好起來嗎
Is that gonna make me better?

559
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,920
我希望會
I hope so.

560
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:31,390
還記得你給我講的那個故事嗎
Do you remember the story you were telling me?

561
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:33,600
你從小住的房子
About the house you grew up in?

562
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,030
我 不 不記得了
I don't remember.

563
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:38,740
湖邊的那個
The one by the lake?

564
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:44,200
好燙啊
It burns.

565
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:45,740
別怕 別怕
I know, I know.

566
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:51,250
打完了 沒事了
There we go. All done.

567
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,790
你真勇敢
You're so brave.

568
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,720
真是不可思議
Oh, that is incredible.

569
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,820
什麼時候能給感染者注射
How soon can you administer to the infected?

570
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,330
你之前還下令朝人群開槍
You show a lot of compassion

571
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:38,930
現在還挺有同情心啊
for someone who just opened fire on a crowd.

572
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:42,330
你要我履行職責 有機會自然要把握住
You told me to do my job. I had a shot. I took it.

573
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,300
但很明顯失手了
And missed, apparently.

574
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,510
巡邏隊沒有發現屍體
The patrols never found a body.

575
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:52,740
托馬斯還活著呢
Thomas is still out there.

576
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:56,810
那特瑞莎呢
What about her?

577
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,050
她知道嗎
Does she know?

578
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,860
不
No.

579
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:04,720
別告訴她
She can't.

580
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:08,920
我需要她集中精力
I need her to stay focused.

581
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:12,530
馬上提升全市的安全級別
Elevate security levels throughout the city.

582
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:15,570
我就指望你把這些事處理好了 詹森
I'm counting on you to handle this, Janson.

583
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:27,540
紅區
Red zone,

584
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:29,310
列車五分鐘後駛離車站
departing the station in five minutes.

585
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:30,620
謝謝
Thank you.

586
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,950
這離迷宮中心遠著呢
This is a long way from the Glade.

587
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:09,780
十五分鐘後開始強制宵禁
Fifteen minutes to mandatory curfew.

588
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:12,690
請大家遵守秩序返回家中
Please proceed home in an orderly fashion.

589
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:15,720
注意 這是為了您的安全
Remember, this is for your safety.

590
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:16,790
感謝您的配合
Thank you for your compliance.

591
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,290
我們最好快離開街道
Yeah, we better get off these streets.

592
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,000
我知道很難 但是你們要擺出一副經歷過這種情況的樣子
And I know it's hard, but act like you've seen it before.

593
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:49,690
警戒程度提高不少
They've definitely upped security.

594
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:53,400
我看應該跟你們有關係吧
I'm guessing you shanks have something to do with that.

595
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,130
好了 我們先走
All right, let's get outta here.

596
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,580
行了 紐特 你先上
All right, Newt, you're up.

597
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,950
我自己來
I got it.

598
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,650
就是這
There it is.

599
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,450
他們抓了米諾
If WICKED's got Minho,

600
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:51,190
肯定關在這
that's where they'll be keeping him.

601
00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:00,700
勞倫斯這些年來一直在想辦法混進去
Lawrence has been trying to find a way in for years.

602
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,500
但這堥麭B都是衛兵
Place is crawling with soldiers.

603
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,070
哪兒都有攝像頭
They got surveillance everywhere.

604
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:11,180
每層都有掃瞄儀
Scanners on every floor.

605
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,680
感覺就像個堡壘
Sounds like a bloody fortress.

606
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,950
你說有辦法進去的
Yeah, I thought you said you had a way in.

607
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:22,080
應該有
I might.

608
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:23,350
應該有
You might?

609
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:25,560
什麼叫應該有
What the hell do you mean "might"?

610
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:31,660
看看吧
Take a look.

611
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,810
我是說有辦法
I said I had a way in.

612
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,250
可沒說你會喜歡這辦法
I didn't say you were gonna like it.

613
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,960
不 肯定有別的辦法
No. There's gotta be another way.

614
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,590
什麼辦法 你看過那棟樓
Like what? You've seen the building.

615
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,160
她是我們唯一的方法
She is our only way in.

616
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:07,800
你覺得她會幫我們
You really think she's gonna help us?

617
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,730
我又沒說要去請她幫忙
I don't plan on asking for her permission.

618
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,070
是我聽錯了嗎
Am I missing something here?

619
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:13,940
你們說的是那個背叛過我們的女人 對吧
This is the same girl who betrayed us, correct?

620
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:15,140
那個賤人
Same dick?

621
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:16,640
我喜歡這種直爽的
I like her.

622
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,580
你怎麼回事
What's going on?

623
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:23,650
怎麼 怕你女朋友
What, are you afraid your little girlfriend's

624
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:25,120
會受傷嗎
gonna get hurt?

625
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,290
你果然不僅僅
Because this has obviously never been

626
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:30,450
是為了救米諾
just about rescuing Minho.

627
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,920
對吧
Has it?

628
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,020
紐特 你在說什麼
Wait, what are you talking about?

629
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,460
特瑞莎
Teresa.

630
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,660
要不是因為她
She's the only reason

631
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:37,860
米諾一開始也不會失蹤
that Minho's even missing in the first place.

632
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,700
現在終於有機會救他了
Now we finally have an opportunity to get him back.

633
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:42,160
結果呢 你又不願意了 因為她
And what? You don't want to because of her?

634
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:43,100
因為你心
Because deep down inside

635
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,370
還在乎她 對不對
you still care about her, don't you?

636
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:45,670
你承認吧
Just admit it.

637
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:47,370
紐特 我 不要對我撒謊
- Newt, I... - Don't lie to me!

638
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,610
不要對我撒謊
Don't lie to me!

639
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,950
抱歉
Sorry.

640
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:05,020
抱歉
I'm sorry.

641
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:34,390
剛才的事 很抱歉
Sorry about that. Back there.

642
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:41,260
看樣子我是瞞不住了
I guess I can't hide this anymore.

643
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,840
為什麼不告訴我
Why didn't you tell me?

644
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,980
告訴你又有什麼用呢
Didn't think it would make any difference.

645
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:04,250
我知道實驗部
All I know is that WICKED must have put me

646
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:05,950
把我關進迷宮是有原因的
in that maze for a reason.

647
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:08,220
他們只想
Maybe it was literally

648
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:09,650
把你這樣的免疫者
just so they could tell the difference

649
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,830
和我這樣的普通人區分開來
between immunes like you and people like me.

650
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:17,930
我們還有希望
You know we can still fix this, Newt.

651
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:21,170
別放棄 好嗎
Okay? We can.

652
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:22,800
不要擔心我
Don't worry about me.

653
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,300
要緊的是米諾
This is about Minho.

654
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:26,970
他現在需要我們
Now he needs us.

655
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:31,540
所以就算只有萬分之一的機會
So if there is even the slightest chance

656
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,210
能救他出來
that we can save him,

657
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:36,220
只要有一點希望我們都要試一試
we can get him out of there, then we have to take that.

658
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:40,820
不管要付出什麼代價
No matter what the cost.

659
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:44,860
好 我明白了
Okay. I hear you.

660
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,120
抬他起來
Let's get him up.

661
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,170
米諾
Minho.

662
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:29,370
能聽見嗎
Can you hear me?

663
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,310
這埵陪茪p女孩
There's a little girl here.

664
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,710
她名叫夏安
Her name is Shai Lun.

665
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:42,220
她已經被感染了三個星期了
She's been infected for three weeks now.

666
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,890
但是米諾
But, Minho,

667
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:47,560
你能救她的命
you're going to save her.

668
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:51,320
而且你還能救很多人的命
And you can save so many others.

669
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:55,330
我們在這付出的努力
Everything we're doing here,

670
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,060
沒有白費
it's working.

671
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:01,940
你明白嗎
Do you understand?

672
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,540
所以我們的工作非常重要
That's why this is so important.

673
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,400
我只想讓你知道
I just wanted you to know.

674
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:38,540
特瑞莎
Teresa.

675
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,020
米諾
Minho?

676
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:56,560
米諾
Minho?

677
00:59:58,530 --> 00:59:59,630
你這個叛徒
You're a traitor!

678
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:03,060
我們那麼信你
We trusted you!

679
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,830
放開她
- Get off! - Hey, let her go!

680
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,040
放開我
Get off me! Get off me!

681
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,700
我要殺了你 你這個叛徒
I'll kill you! You traitor!

682
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:16,270
你把他們都害死了
You killed them all!

683
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:29,050
特瑞莎 醫學實驗室叫你
Teresa, they need you in the med lab.

684
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,590
好像很著急
It sounds serious.

685
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,430
我很遺憾 特瑞莎
I'm sorry, Teresa.

686
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:50,180
這不是你的錯
It's not your fault.

687
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:54,350
你真的已經盡力了
You did everything you could.

688
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:26,540
請大家注意 宵禁已經開始
This is an alert. Curfew is now in effect.

689
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:28,140
違反宵禁令外出者
Anyone caught in violation of curfew

690
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,510
將被立即驅逐出城
will be subject to immediate deportation.

691
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:30,610
托馬斯
Thomas?

692
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:55,800
托馬斯
Thomas.

693
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,440
特瑞莎
Hey, Teresa.

694
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,180
你不應該來的
You shouldn't be here.

695
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:04,740
如果詹森發現你在這
If Janson finds out you're here...

696
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:06,380
我不會久留
I'm not staying.

697
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:10,190
我只是
It's just, uh...

698
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:13,560
要見見你
I had to see you.

699
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:18,130
想問你個問題
I have to ask you something.

700
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,100
背叛了我們
Do you regret it?

701
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:26,240
你後悔嗎
What you did to us?

702
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:31,670
有時候會
Sometimes.

703
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:37,080
但我做了我認為對的事
But I did what I thought was right.

704
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,280
要是能重來 我還會這麼做
I'd do it again.

705
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:47,820
很好
Good.

706
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:23,390
難得放鬆一下是嗎
Taking the edge off, I see.

707
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:26,660
多漂亮的城市
Beautiful, isn't it?

708
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,170
是啊
Yes.

709
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:34,770
真漂亮
- It's a lovely city. - Hmm.

710
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:37,640
那些牆
The walls.

711
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:42,310
當人們命懸一線時
It's amazing what people can accomplish

712
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:45,040
總會爆發非凡的力量
when their survival's at stake.

713
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:48,650
只要逼得夠緊 他們就沒什麼做不到的
Squeeze them hard enough, there's nothing they can't do.

714
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:53,420
沒什麼底線不能打破
No line they won't cross.

715
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,090
這只是一個小挫折
You've had a bit of a setback.

716
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:59,200
我們早就習慣挫折了
It's nothing we're not used to.

717
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,660
這次不一樣
Not this time.

718
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:06,370
病毒通過空氣
The virus is airborne.

719
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:08,270
已經傳到城堣F
It's inside the walls.

720
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:12,740
那個血清是最後的希望
That serum was our last chance.

721
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:16,450
頂多一個月內 所有人都會受到感染
Anyone not already infected will be inside of a month.

722
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,220
好吧
Okay.

723
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:25,390
我們還有辦法
We can handle this.

724
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:27,190
只需要撤離關鍵人員
We just need to evacuate essential personnel,

725
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:28,820
然後繼續北上在建立一個安全區
set up at another safe zone farther north.

726
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:31,590
這棟樓媮晹酗G十八名免疫者
We've still got 28 immunes right inside this building.

727
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,730
我們還能找到更多
We can find more.

728
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,800
我相信
You would.

729
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:37,500
你會抓住所有的免疫者
You'd hunt every last one of them down

730
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,700
直到一個也不剩
till there was no one left.

731
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:46,980
儘管我們這樣殘忍地利用他們
In spite of everything we've done to them,

732
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:51,350
讓他們受盡了折磨
everything we've put them through.

733
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:00,120
但至少我們給了
At least we gave them the tools

734
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,830
他們生存的希望
they'll need to survive.

735
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,430
也許他們能做到我們做不到的
Maybe they'll succeed where we've failed.

736
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,800
你這是告訴我你要放棄嗎
Are you really telling me that you're giving up?

737
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,770
付出了那麼多
After everything?

738
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:21,540
我不是要放棄 詹森
It's not about giving up, Janson.

739
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,320
是要做好失敗的心理準備
It's about knowing when you've lost.

740
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:51,140
蓋
Gally?

741
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,940
接下來我們這麼辦
Here's how this is gonna go.

742
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,810
我們要問你幾個問題
We're gonna ask you some questions,

743
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:59,710
而你要老實回答我們
and you're gonna tell us exactly what we need to know.

744
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:03,220
我們從簡單的開始  米諾在哪兒
We'll start off simple. Where's Minho?

745
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,390
你們不會真的以為...
You guys don't seriously think...

746
01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:07,150
不要看他
Don't look at him.

747
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,960
你為什麼要看他
Why are you looking at him?

748
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,460
看我
Look at me.

749
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:12,560
他不會幫你的
He's not gonna help you.

750
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:17,400
我們知道你們把米諾關在那棟樓
Now, we know you have Minho in the building.

751
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:19,610
哪一層？
Where?

752
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:23,200
他和其他人都在關押區
He's with the others in holding.

753
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:24,810
地下三層
Sublevel three.

754
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,380
其他人有多少？
How many others?

755
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:30,050
二十八個
28.

756
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:33,910
我都能救出去
I can make that work.

757
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,020
不  你們不明白
No. No, you guys don't understand.

758
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:38,750
整層樓都是限製出入的
The whole level's restricted.

759
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,760
你們沒有指紋認證根本進不去
You can't get in without a thumbprint ID.

760
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,730
所以要你跟我們一起去
That's why you're gonna come with us.

761
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:45,030
那可不一定
Well, I don't know.

762
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:48,370
我們也不一定需要她
We don't necessarily need her.

763
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:50,070
對吧
Right?

764
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,900
不用整個人
Not all of her.

765
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:56,170
- 有指紋就夠了 - 蓋  你夠了
- We just need her finger. - Gally, back off.

766
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:57,410
你覺得過分了？
What, are you squeamish?

767
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:59,370
我敢說她對米諾做的事肯定更過分
I guarantee you she's done a lot worse to Minho.

768
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,040
這不是我們的計劃  你讓開
That's not the plan. Back off.

769
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:02,510
沒有區別的
It won't make a difference.

770
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:04,040
你們怎麼對我都行
Do whatever you want to me.

771
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:05,780
但你們是進不去的
You still won't get through the front door.

772
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:07,050
傳感器會發現你們
The sensors will pick you up the...

773
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:08,750
我們知道 因為我們...被植入了芯片
We know. We're tagged.

774
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:11,720
實驗部資產
Property of WICKED.

775
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:17,360
你也能幫我們摘掉
You're gonna help us with that, too.

776
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:25,670
放鬆一點  會有點疼
Try to relax. This is gonna sting.

777
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,610
你快動手吧
Let's just get it over with.

778
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:40,380
她很享受吧
She enjoyed that.

779
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:42,020
你也許是對的
You're probably right.

780
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:44,250
給你  看合不合適
Here. See if these fit.

781
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:46,390
- 謝謝 - 謝謝  紐特
- Thanks. - Thanks, Newt.

782
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:52,800
該出發了  老頭子
Better get going, old man.

783
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,430
路可遠著呢
Long road ahead of you.

784
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,200
你真的不聽我的勸嗎
You sure I can't talk you out of this?

785
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,710
現在還來得及
It's your last chance.

786
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:06,440
我不像你總喜歡逃避戰鬥
You know, it's not like you to shy away from a fight.

787
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:09,040
追求戰鬥也不是你的個性
And it's not like you to go looking for one.

788
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:11,350
我只是忍不住想 一旦我走出門
I just can't help but think if I walk out that door...

789
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:13,020
就再也見不到你了
I'm never gonna see you again.

790
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:17,920
仔細想想  我們什麼時候開始為陌生人出生入死了
Since when do we go sticking our necks out for strangers?

791
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:22,830
我也曾是你的陌生人
I was a stranger once, too.

792
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:34,140
-隻是別讓我們等太久  -不
- Just don't leave us hanging. - No.

793
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:36,740
不會的
Never.

794
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,880
她看起來很好
She's looking good.

795
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:47,980
很健康
Healthy.

796
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:52,090
你們給她注射血清了
How've you been getting her serum?

797
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:55,530
你在說什麼
What are you talking about?

798
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:57,830
布倫達
Brenda.

799
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:02,030
我沒想到她能活下來
I didn't think she'd still be alive.

800
01:10:04,770 --> 01:10:06,540
上次治療是什麼時候？
When was her last treatment?

801
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,970
在干將組織
At the Right Arm.

802
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:11,980
上次見你的時候
The last time we saw you.

803
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:17,720
那都好幾個月前了
But that was months ago.

804
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:24,750
托馬斯  這根本不可能
Thomas, that's not possible.

805
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:28,690
她現在應該已經發作了啊
She should have turned by now.

806
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:30,430
她怎麼可能還能...
There's no way she could possibly still...

807
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:32,030
夠了  別說了
All right, that's enough.

808
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:34,930
你不相信我嗎？
You don't believe me?

809
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:37,870
你覺得我能信你嗎？
Do you really expect me to?

810
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,640
你做出了選擇
You made your choice.

811
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,780
你們倆沒事吧
Everything okay over here?

812
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:50,550
沒事
Yeah.

813
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:52,720
我們說完了
Yeah, we're done.

814
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:05,200
想得美
Nice try.

815
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:16,210
你愛過她的  對嗎？
You were in love with her, weren't you?

816
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:20,880
我不知道
I don't know.

817
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:26,550
你要注意一點
Just be careful.

818
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:27,680
你的軟肋
You sort of have this problem

819
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:29,890
就是沒法拋下別人
where you can't walk away from people.

820
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:32,690
即使你應當拋下
Even when you should.

821
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:37,330
你拯救不了所有人  托馬斯
You can't save everyone, Thomas.

822
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:43,630
總得試試
I can try.

823
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:12,900
別停下
Don't stop.

824
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:03,810
快
Go, go, go.

825
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:05,220
等等
Hold on. Hold on.

826
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:07,450
這個我能搞定
I can get in here.

827
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:09,350
-待著別動  -對講機給我
Stay there. Throw me the walkie.

828
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:34,180
煎鍋  我們進來了  你那邊怎樣？
Frypan, we're in. How you doing?

829
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,120
好  快了  我也快到了
Yeah, I'm getting there.

830
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,380
代我向米諾問好
Tell Minho "Hi," for me.

831
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:43,020
堅持住  夥計
Hang in there, buddy.

832
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:49,830
這就行了
This'll work.

833
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:51,490
布倫達  你那邊怎樣
Brenda, what's your status?

834
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:54,130
不怎麼樣  我在想辦法
Status is, I'm working on it.

835
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:56,370
收到  確保你那邊準備好了
Copy. Just make sure you're ready on your end.

836
01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:01,010
不用擔心  我會準時到那兒的
Don't worry. You know I'm gonna be there.

837
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:07,450
我們走
All right, let's go.

838
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:14,350
收到信號了
We got a signal.

839
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,290
蓋媟d定了
Gally did it.

840
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:18,390
我們黑進去了
We're in.

841
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:22,330
很好
Good.

842
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:25,360
放開手腳干
Give me everything.

843
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:28,470
徹底控制那
I want full control.

844
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:33,040
奇怪  系統故障了
That's funny. System's glitching.

845
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,740
我出去看看
I'll go check it out.

846
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:55,260
走吧  快點  走
Get back, get back! Move!

847
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:14,380
快點  我們走
Come on, let's go.

848
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:16,810
沒事
- Get them open. - Let's go.

849
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:18,350
來吧  我們走
It's okay. You guys are okay. Come on.

850
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:21,190
紐特 去看看另一間牢房
Come on, let's go. Newt, check the other cell.

851
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:24,090
你們沒事了  快走吧
Come on, you guys are okay. Come on.

852
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:26,130
保險庫  怎麼進去
The vault. How do I get in?

853
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:29,000
進不去的
You can't.

854
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,330
大家快點  快走
Come on, guys. Come on.

855
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:34,970
各位
Guys,

856
01:15:34,970 --> 01:15:36,870
可能要花些時間
this might take some time.

857
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:42,320
見鬼
Shit.

858
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:44,540
他不在這兒
He's not here.

859
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:46,850
他人在哪兒
Where is he?

860
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:56,460
真的不能等到明早嗎
This really couldn't wait till morning?

861
01:15:57,590 --> 01:15:59,020
一次注射這麼大劑量
You realize this could kill him, right?

862
01:15:59,030 --> 01:16:00,520
他會沒命的  你知道嗎
Taking this much, all at once.

863
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:02,290
我只是執行命令
I have my orders.

864
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:04,000
是詹森要求的
Janson wants it all.

865
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:16,370
有人把米諾帶去醫學部了
Somebody's moved him up to the medical wing.

866
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:19,250
托馬斯  那是大樓的另一邊
Thomas, that's on the other side of the building.

867
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,910
好  這就帶我去找他
Okay, take me to him. Right now.

868
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,480
我要跟你一起去
All right. I'm coming with you.

869
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:25,580
紐特  你不能去 聽著
Newt, no, you're not.

870
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:28,020
你留在這  等蓋堮釣鴞撗M
You have to stay here, wait with Gally for the serum.

871
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:30,120
你不能一個人冒險
You can't do this on your own.

872
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,530
米諾之前不就是那樣麼
Minho comes first, remember?

873
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:34,060
快走吧  別浪費時間了
Just go. We're wasting time.

874
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:36,160
我會搞到血清的  我們在外面會合
I'll get the serum. We'll meet you out back.

875
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:39,900
-好吧  我們走  -走吧
Okay, fine. Let's go. Come on.

876
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,100
嘿  菜鳥
Hey, Greenie.

877
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:44,900
祝你好運
Good luck.

878
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:58,020
不要停
Keep moving.

879
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,170
快點 快點
Come on, come on.

880
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,550
等等
Hold it.

881
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,070
熬夜工作了吧
You're working late.

882
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:56,610
特瑞莎  我就喜歡你這一點
See, that's what I like about you, Teresa.

883
01:17:56,610 --> 01:17:59,780
不管有多困難
No matter how bleak things get, you just...

884
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:01,320
你都不曾放棄
Well, you never give up.

885
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:04,150
現在這種情況
Times like this,

886
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:06,290
你需要一個靠得住的朋友
you need a friend that you can count on.

887
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,030
我會留心的
I'll bear that in mind.

888
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,060
有件事應該告訴你
There is one thing you should know.

889
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:19,700
但別說是我說的
One friend to another.

890
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:23,600
托馬斯就在城
Thomas is here.

891
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:35,750
我們的監控在牆外發現他了
A surveillance picked him up outside the walls.

892
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:37,080
艾娃不想讓你知道
Ava didn't want you to know,

893
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,680
但托馬斯可能會嘗試找你
but there is a chance that he may try to contact you,

894
01:18:39,690 --> 01:18:41,220
如果你見到他了...
and if he does,

895
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:47,300
那麼我希望你能第一時間通知我
I'd like to think that I'd be your first call.

896
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,500
你會殺了他嗎？
Are you going to kill him?

897
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:55,640
有問題嗎？
Would that be a problem?

898
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:02,680
我到了
This is me.

899
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:30,440
托馬斯  你先聽我說
Thomas, you have to listen to me.

900
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,440
拿到血清也救不了紐特
Getting that serum won't save Newt.

901
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,210
只能讓他活久一點  但是...
It might buy him some time, but...

902
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:35,270
別聽她的
Just ignore her.

903
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,540
她想要給你洗腦
She's trying to get inside your head.

904
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:39,080
托馬斯  聽我說 你知道外面的情況
Thomas, listen. You know what's going on out there.

905
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:42,150
人類要滅絕了  世界要毀滅了
People are dying. The world is dying.

906
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:44,950
你血液的情況我覺得有些異常
There's something about your blood I don't understand.

907
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:46,820
開門
Open it.

908
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:49,360
讓我做幾個測試吧
If you let me run some tests...

909
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,320
我保證會保護你的
I promise I can protect you.

910
01:19:51,330 --> 01:19:53,690
是嗎  像保護米諾那樣
Yeah? Like you protected Minho?

911
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:54,830
你這是幹什麼
What are you doing?

912
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:56,230
你們還要犧牲多少人
How many people is it gonna take?

913
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:57,760
你們要抓捕
How many more people do they have to round up,

914
01:19:57,770 --> 01:19:58,900
折磨  殺害多少人 才夠
torture, kill?

915
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,100
什麼時候才會結束
Huh? When the hell does it stop?

916
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:01,830
等找到解藥就結束了
It stops when we find a cure.

917
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,710
根本就沒有什麼解藥
There is no goddamn cure!

918
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:08,280
別白費口舌了  特瑞莎
Don't waste your breath, Teresa.

919
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:12,910
他早就做出選擇了
He made his choice long ago.

920
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:14,120
把槍放下
Drop it, kid!

921
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:19,620
退後 叫他們退後
Back up. Tell them to back off.

922
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:20,820
叫他們退後
Tell them to back off!

923
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:22,620
嘿  托馬斯
Hey, Thomas, come on.

924
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:23,960
是我
It's me.

925
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:25,930
我認識你很多年了
I've known you longer than you can remember.

926
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:27,890
你不會朝她開槍的
You're not gonna shoot her.

927
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:29,530
你以為我不敢
You don't think so?

928
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:32,500
好啊
Okay.

929
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:34,440
來啊
Go on then.

930
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,170
開槍啊
Shoot her.

931
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:42,180
證明給我看
Prove me wrong.

932
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:49,550
開槍
Shoot her.

933
01:20:56,530 --> 01:20:57,570
讓開 讓開
Clear! Clear!

934
01:20:58,230 --> 01:20:59,430
快 快
Move! Move!

935
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:13,070
你要好好解釋一下這是什麼情況
Your story better be good.

936
01:21:13,070 --> 01:21:14,980
我這是幫了你的忙
I just did you a favor.

937
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:17,310
門鎖死了 他們逃不出去
Doors are sealed. They can't get out.

938
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:20,620
詹森 我要你活捉他們
Janson, I need them alive.

939
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:22,650
快來
- Come on. Come on! - All right, let's move!

940
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:24,820
快來三樓
Yes, sir! Level three, now!

941
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,460
我們馬上逃出去
Okay. We need to get outta here now.

942
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:37,800
大家在一起 跟緊我
You stay close to me. Stick together.

943
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:41,940
你拿好這個 拼了命去保護它 明白了麼
You, you guard this with your life. You understand?

944
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,840
好了
All right.

945
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:48,210
我們走
Let's go.

946
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:51,580
封鎖大樓 派人去20樓
Lock down the building. Send everyone up to 20.

947
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:53,310
來人把那該死的警報給關上
And someone shut off those goddamn sirens!

948
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:54,520
是 長官
Yes, sir.

949
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:01,650

快快快
Go! Go! Go!

952
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:07,290
把頭埋低
Go! Stay low! Stay low!

953
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:09,330
布倫達 你在哪 我們來了

托馬斯在哪
Wait, where's Thomas?

958
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:22,040
我還以為她跟你會合了呢
I was hoping he was with you.

959
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,140
慢著
Come on.

960
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:24,950
你在這跟孩子們在一起

I'll find him.

963
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:31,280
在這等著
Just wait for us, okay?

我們哪都不去
We're not going anywhere.

965
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:34,250
有蹤跡了麼
Anything?

966
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:35,450
他們不在這 長官
No sign of them yet, sir.

967
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:36,520
他們肯定在這
Yeah, well, they're here somewhere.

968
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:37,790
他們逃不出去的 找到他們

所有工作人員請留在各自的房間

執行戒嚴令  嚴禁任何人進出
Declare martial law. No one leaves until they're found.

It's done, sir. We already have eyes on the bus.

1070
01:34:34,810 --> 01:34:36,280
閉嘴
Shut up.

1071
01:34:46,790 --> 01:34:48,460
他們還沒逃出去
They're not out yet.

1072
01:35:04,810 --> 01:35:07,650
他們肯定氣瘋了
Well, they're definitely pissed.

1073
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:10,380
隧道還有多遠
How far are the tunnels?

1074
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:13,120
大概還有十二條街吧
Uh, maybe 12 blocks from here.

1075
01:35:18,690 --> 01:35:20,200
我們能趕上的
We can make it.

1076

總算見到你了

1079
01:35:40,010 --> 01:35:42,080
他變成這樣多久了
How long has he been like this?

1080
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:45,790
他不會有事的  我們去找布倫達
He'll be okay. We just gotta get to Brenda.

1081
01:35:48,150 --> 01:35:50,190
她有血清
She's got the serum.

1082
01:35:50,190 --> 01:35:51,920
好了  我們走
Come on, let's go.

1083
01:35:51,930 --> 01:35:53,390
紐特  堅持住

-不要緊吧  -沒事
- You okay? - Yeah.

1086
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:02,470
你為什麼要幫我們 蓋
Why you helping us, Gally?

1087
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:05,040
我在你胸口開了個洞
I put a spear through your chest.

1088
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:07,580
沒錯
Yeah.

1089
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:10,350
不過人無完人
Nobody's perfect, man.

1090
01:36:37,570 --> 01:36:38,740
勞倫斯

1094
01:36:51,750 --> 01:36:53,190
托馬斯
Thomas!

1095
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:56,860
勞倫斯
Lawrence!

1096
01:36:57,730 --> 01:36:59,430
所有東西都不見了
Everything's gone.

1097
01:37:39,070 --> 01:37:41,130
不要怕
Don't be scared.

1098
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:43,270
也許我長得不好看
I may not be pretty,

1099
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:47,110
但我們都認得敵人的長相
but we all know who the enemies are,

1100
01:37:47,110 --> 01:37:49,270
他們就躲在這堵牆後面
cowering behind those walls!

1101
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:54,480
沒錯 他們起了個名字
They have a name

1102
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:58,080
來稱呼像我們這樣的人
for people like us in there.

1103
01:37:58,090 --> 01:38:00,360
他們叫我們狂客
They call us Cranks!

1104
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,860
但要我說 他們才是怪物
But I say that they are the monsters.

1105
01:38:05,430 --> 01:38:07,790
是他們發起的這場戰爭
They're the ones who started this war,

1106
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:08,840
但是今晚
but tonight,

1107
01:38:09,860 --> 01:38:11,500
我們要終結它
we will finish it.

1108
01:38:12,670 --> 01:38:15,100
跟著我
Follow me.

1109
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:17,040
跟著我  讓他們好好認識一下
Follow me, and we will show them

1110
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,640
他們選擇
the faces of the people

1111
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:21,240
遺忘的這些面孔
that they have chosen to forget!

1112
01:38:25,610 --> 01:38:28,550
跟著我著座城市就是你們的了
Follow me and this city is yours!

1113
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:54,840
準備出發

Let's go!

1115
01:39:11,660 --> 01:39:13,290
控制台  你們看到了嗎
Control, you seeing this?

1116

請求指示
Please advise.

1117
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:16,100
我的天
Holy shit.

1118
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:18,600
一號  二號炮塔準備開火
Get turrets one and two ready to fire.

1119
01:39:26,410 --> 01:39:28,010
手動控制失敗  拒絕訪問
Guns aren't responding. I'm locked out.

1120
01:39:30,310 --> 01:39:31,910
炮塔沒有反應 我被鎖死了
All right. Move forward.

1121
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:33,880
快過來  向前靠 開火  開火
Open fire! Open fire!

1122
01:39:56,370 --> 01:39:57,800
我們的目標是實驗部
We're supposed to take down WICKED,

1123
01:39:57,810 --> 01:39:59,270
不是整座城市
not the whole damn city.

1124
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:04,910
蓋  走吧
Gally, come on.

1125
01:40:17,490 --> 01:40:19,790
現在發佈強制撤離命令
This is a mandatory evacuation.

1126
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:23,060
最後一班車將在38分鐘後出發
The last transport leaves in 38 minutes.

1127

1128
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:27,770
重複一遍  現在發佈強制撤離命令
I repeat, this is a mandatory evacuation.

1129
01:40:27,770 --> 01:40:31,140

你看
Come. Look.

1135
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:48,090
它不止減緩了病毒的擴散
It's not just slowing the virus down.

1136
01:40:52,390 --> 01:40:54,460
還在摧毀它們

懂了嗎
Okay?

1163
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:53,580
想都別想
So forget it.

1164
01:42:56,390 --> 01:42:58,120
即使你應當拋下？
Even though you should?

1165
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:18,400

Thomas, don't worry. I'm coming to you.

1166

我讓他搭了便車
I picked up a stray.

1176
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:53,540

01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:07,370
大家別出來  別出來
Get back, guys, get back!

1219
01:47:07,370 --> 01:47:08,400
我的天
Oh, man.

1220
01:47:08,410 --> 01:47:10,370
沒事的 我們馬上離開這
It's okay, guys. We're getting out of here soon.

1221
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:12,040
我們不能再久留了
We can't stay here, Bren.

1222
01:47:12,810 --> 01:47:15,780
別著急  他們會來的
Don't worry. They'll be here.

1223
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:17,280
快點 快點
Come on. Come on.

1224
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:28,390
就快到了  紐特  跟我來  挺住
We're almost there, Newt. Stay with me, come on.

1225
01:47:29,530 --> 01:47:31,930
不  紐特
Newt, no, no. Hey!

1226
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:38,900
撐住
Come on.

1227
01:47:53,450 --> 01:47:54,890
托馬斯
Thomas?

1228
01:47:58,460 --> 01:47:59,820
你能聽到嗎
Can you hear me?

1229
01:48:02,390 --> 01:48:03,760
我需要你聽我說
I need you to listen to me.

1230
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:08,000
我知道你沒有理由相信我
I know you have no reason to trust me,

1231
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:14,440
但我需要你回來
but I need you to come back.

1232
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:21,350
托馬斯  你可以拯救紐特
Thomas, you can save Newt.

1233
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:25,320
他還有時間
There's still time for him.

1234
01:48:27,050 --> 01:48:30,590
布倫達病情的好轉是有原因的
There's a reason Brenda isn't sick anymore.

1235
01:48:30,590 --> 01:48:32,420
是因為你的血
It's your blood.

1236
01:48:33,390 --> 01:48:35,930
你明白嗎
Do you understand?

1237
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:38,560
她沒病發是因為...
She isn't sick,

1238
01:48:39,530 --> 01:48:41,530
因為你治好了她
because you cured her.

1239
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:47,170
你能救的不止她一個
She doesn't have to be the only one.

1240
01:48:49,010 --> 01:48:51,710
你只要回來就行了
All you have to do is come back.

1241
01:48:51,710 --> 01:48:54,180
我們一起結束這一切
And this will all finally be over.

1242
01:48:58,120 --> 01:48:59,160
求你了
Please.

1243
01:49:00,850 --> 01:49:02,890
回來我這吧
Just come back to me.

1244
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:06,390
我知道你會做出正確的...
I know you'll do the right...

1245
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:22,840
紐特？
Newt?

1246
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:34,120
紐特
Newt?

1247
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:40,260
紐特  紐特  是我
Newt? Newt, it's me. It's me!

1248
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:47,470
布倫達
Brenda!

1249
01:49:49,370 --> 01:49:50,670
血清在哪
Where's the serum?

1250
01:49:54,810 --> 01:49:57,380
托馬斯 殺了我
Tommy, kill me!

1251
01:49:57,880 --> 01:50:00,350
紐特  我在這
Newt, I'm here.

1252
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:09,320
紐特  別這樣
Newt, please!

1253
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:11,890
求你了
Please!

1254
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,630
真的對不起  對不起  托馬斯
I'm sorry, Tommy.

1255
01:50:21,570 --> 01:50:23,400
沒事的  沒事的
It's okay. It's okay.

1256
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:28,980
不
No!

1257
01:50:32,510 --> 01:50:34,380
布倫達
Brenda!

1258
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:35,950
托馬斯
Thomas!

1259
01:50:35,950 --> 01:50:37,350
趴下  快趴下
Stay down, stay down!

1260
01:51:03,380 --> 01:51:04,510
紐特
Newt.

1261
01:51:21,430 --> 01:51:22,530
托馬斯
Tommy.

1262
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:28,480
不
No, no.

1263
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:39,350
不  不
No, no, no.

1264
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:45,730
紐特
Newt?

1265
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:54,520
是真的嗎
Is it true?

1266
01:53:58,720 --> 01:53:59,760
紐特
Newt.

1267
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:04,690
我能救他的嗎
Could I have saved him?

1268
01:54:08,030 --> 01:54:10,130
你能拯救所有人
You can save us all.

1269
01:54:32,850 --> 01:54:33,920
沒事了
It's okay.

1270
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:39,790
放其他人走好嗎
Just leave the others alone.

1271
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:44,630
我保證
I promise.

1272
01:54:48,970 --> 01:54:50,270
我會...
I will...

1273
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:47,600
噢  托馬斯
Oh, Thomas.

1274
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:54,900
托馬斯 你應該逃跑的
You should have run.

1275
01:55:57,710 --> 01:55:58,910
托馬斯
Thomas.

1276
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:03,340
聽到了嗎
Can you hear me?

1277
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:31,940
你知道這是什麼地方嗎  托馬斯
Do you know what this place is, Thomas?

1278
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:37,680
這是救生船
It's a lifeboat.

1279
01:56:39,150 --> 01:56:42,450
整個世界就要被淹沒了
And the whole world might be sinking,

1280
01:56:42,450 --> 01:56:45,350
但不代表我們也要跟著沉沒
but doesn't mean that we have to go down with it.

1281
01:56:47,790 --> 01:56:49,450
還要多久
How much longer?

1282
01:56:49,460 --> 01:56:51,290
快了
It's almost done.

1283
01:56:56,430 --> 01:56:57,900
為什麼不直接殺了我？
Why don't you just kill me?

1284
01:56:57,900 --> 01:56:59,300
殺了你？
Kill you?

1285
01:57:00,170 --> 01:57:02,340
我才捨不得殺你呢
No, we don't wanna do that.

1286
01:57:05,210 --> 01:57:07,840
我們會精心照顧你的
We're gonna take special care of you.

1287
01:57:09,080 --> 01:57:10,780
讓你好好活著
We'll keep you alive.

1288
01:57:11,410 --> 01:57:12,650
只不過...
Just.

1289
01:57:15,350 --> 01:57:17,520
作為回報
And in return,

1290
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:20,420
你得為我們剩下的人續命
you will give life to the rest of us.

1291
01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:23,060
當然是我來選擇救誰
The ones we choose to save, anyway.

1292
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:29,660
當然這並不夠拯救所有人
Of course, there's not gonna be enough for everyone.

1293
01:57:29,660 --> 01:57:31,930
我們必須做出困難的選擇
Hard choices are gonna have to be made.

1294
01:57:31,930 --> 01:57:34,970
耀斑病毒早晚有一天會消失
In time, the Flare virus will burn itself out.

1295
01:57:34,970 --> 01:57:36,640
可唯一的問題在於
The only question is,

1296
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:40,580
哪些人能活到那一天
who will be the ones left standing?

1297
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:46,150
多虧了你 還有這個
And thanks to you, to this,

1298
01:57:46,150 --> 01:57:48,820
我們終於可以選擇
we finally get to choose.

1299
01:57:51,020 --> 01:57:54,490
自己親手創造一個未來
A future of our own making.

1300
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:02,400
祝你健康
To your health.

1301
01:58:10,210 --> 01:58:12,070
好了  我們趕緊走
Okay, let's get out of here.

1302
01:58:15,140 --> 01:58:16,180
拜託
Come on.

1303
01:58:20,450 --> 01:58:21,650
不
No!

1304
01:58:28,390 --> 01:58:30,660
你給我回來
Get back here.

1305
01:58:30,660 --> 01:58:31,890
回來
Get back!

1306
01:58:31,900 --> 01:58:32,990
不
No!

1307
01:58:34,460 --> 01:58:35,730
把它給我！
Give it to me.

1308
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:39,740
把它給我！
Give it to me!

1309
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:42,670
特瑞莎！
Teresa!

1310
01:59:18,010 --> 01:59:19,480
好啊  來啊
Come on.

1311
01:59:31,850 --> 01:59:33,220
好了
Okay.

1312
01:59:34,390 --> 01:59:35,720
夠了
That's enough.

1313
01:59:47,270 --> 01:59:48,570
準備武器
Weapons ready!

1314
01:59:48,570 --> 01:59:50,040
聽我指揮
On my command.

1315
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:52,070
裝彈
Charge it!

1316
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:53,810
準備
Ready.

1317
01:59:54,210 --> 01:59:55,250
開火
Fire!

1318
02:00:07,990 --> 02:00:09,230
特瑞莎
Teresa!

1319
02:00:18,130 --> 02:00:20,140
該死  我們得逃出去
We need to get out of here.

1320
02:00:20,970 --> 02:00:22,540
怎麼了
What's wrong?

1321
02:00:25,910 --> 02:00:26,950
托馬斯？
Thomas?

1322
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:29,280
托馬斯！
Thomas!

1323
02:00:35,990 --> 02:00:37,850
-沒事  我們要  -見鬼
- Okay. Okay, we need to... - Oh, shit...

1324
02:00:39,190 --> 02:00:41,720
拜託  在哪  這
Find something. Here. Here!

1325
02:00:42,790 --> 02:00:45,430
這樣  用手壓住傷口  按住
Just put pressure on it. Hold it.

1326
02:00:47,030 --> 02:00:48,260
你...你快走吧
You gotta go.

1327
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:51,300
你快走吧
You gotta go.

1328
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:52,340
不
No.

1329
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:54,700
要走一起走
Not without you.

1330
02:01:20,660 --> 02:01:23,070
我必須承認  特瑞莎  你把我耍了
I admit, Teresa, you had me fooled.

1331
02:01:24,700 --> 02:01:26,940
我還以為我們是朋友
I thought we were friends.

1332
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:35,240
也許你的本能就是
Maybe it's just in your nature to betray

1333
02:01:35,250 --> 02:01:37,780
會背叛你親近的人
the people closest to you.

1334
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:46,620
出來吧
Come on.

1335
02:01:48,460 --> 02:01:50,930
不要再拖拉了
Let's not prolong this.

1336
02:01:53,200 --> 02:01:56,070
我們都清楚你們逃不掉的了
We both know there's no way outta here.

1337
02:01:59,870 --> 02:02:01,700
不要再給
Let's not make this any more painful

1338
02:02:01,710 --> 02:02:03,870
自己增加傷痛了
than it needs to be.

1339
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:09,220
托馬斯
Thomas.

1340
02:02:13,180 --> 02:02:14,230
特瑞莎
Teresa.

1341
02:02:29,400 --> 02:02:31,270
不  不
No. No.

1342
02:02:34,510 --> 02:02:37,740
你好像拿了我的東西
I think you have something of mine.

1343
02:02:47,350 --> 02:02:48,820
不是那個
Not that.

1344
02:02:50,490 --> 02:02:51,960
他人在哪
Where is he?

1345
02:02:52,490 --> 02:02:54,690
拿這個走吧
Just take it.

1346
02:02:54,690 --> 02:02:56,460
放過他吧
Leave him alone.

1347
02:02:56,460 --> 02:02:58,260
你們兩個怎麼回事
What is it with you two?

1348
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:02,230
你以為他很特別嗎
You think he's so special?

1349
02:03:02,230 --> 02:03:04,370
他是只小白鼠 天生免疫病毒
He's a lab rat. He was born with a gift.

1350
02:03:04,370 --> 02:03:07,870
不用靠後天的努力 去和病毒抗爭
He never had to fight for it, he never earned it.

1351
02:03:07,870 --> 02:03:09,970
他根本就配不上
He doesn't deserve it.

1352
02:03:10,570 --> 02:03:12,080
也許吧
Maybe.

1353
02:03:13,140 --> 02:03:14,410
但他就是他
But it's his.

1354
02:03:17,610 --> 02:03:19,150
你怎麼想  托馬斯
What about you, Thomas?

1355
02:03:20,450 --> 02:03:22,880
你不想說點什麼嗎
What do you have to say?

1356
02:03:22,890 --> 02:03:25,860
你的手上沾的血還不夠嗎
Don't you have enough blood on your hands already?

1357
02:03:27,090 --> 02:03:29,420
你也許沒法向她開槍
You might not have been able to shoot her.

1358
02:03:29,430 --> 02:03:31,200
但我可以
But I can.

1359
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:37,070
行吧  好
Okay. Fine.

1360
02:03:37,570 --> 02:03:38,700
隨便你吧
Have it your way.

1361
02:03:40,170 --> 02:03:41,300
詹森
Janson.

1362
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:48,450
你打偏了  小兔崽子
Missed, you little shit.

1363
02:03:49,410 --> 02:03:50,460
是嗎
Did I?

1364
02:03:56,790 --> 02:03:58,160
該死
Oh, shit.

1365
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:08,530
快走  我們趕緊走
Come on. We need to go.

1366
02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:19,810
走這邊  這
This way. Here.

1367
02:04:29,750 --> 02:04:31,160
這
Come on.

1368
02:04:55,550 --> 02:04:56,780
快
Come on.

1369
02:05:40,290 --> 02:05:41,560
對不起  我...
I'm sorry.

1370
02:05:43,260 --> 02:05:44,530
我盡力了
I tried.

1371
02:05:49,330 --> 02:05:50,570
我...我知道
I know.

1372
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:12,360
我好像看到他了
I think I got him.

1373
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:13,790
對對  就是他  我去開門
Yeah, that's him. I'll get the hatch.

1374
02:06:13,790 --> 02:06:14,860
好了  找到他了  快點
All right, I got him, I got him.

1375
02:06:14,860 --> 02:06:16,060
快走
Let's go, let's go.

1376
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:19,230
快呀
Come on.

1377
02:06:32,650 --> 02:06:34,050
不
No!

1378
02:06:38,020 --> 02:06:40,290
我沒法再靠近了
I can't get any closer.

1379
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:46,160
托馬斯
Thomas!

1380
02:06:48,430 --> 02:06:49,530
快
Now!

1381
02:07:00,870 --> 02:07:02,340
拜託  拜託
Come on, come on, come on.

1382
02:07:03,980 --> 02:07:06,740
快點  快點  托馬斯
- Come on! - Come on, Thomas!

1383
02:07:06,740 --> 02:07:08,550
把手給我
Give me your hand!

1384
02:07:09,020 --> 02:07:10,920
再近一點
Get closer!

1385
02:07:11,650 --> 02:07:12,690
跳啊
Jump!

1386
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:15,920
低點
Lower!

1387
02:07:19,290 --> 02:07:20,720
快 不
No!

1388
02:07:20,730 --> 02:07:22,330
你們得再靠近一點
You gotta get closer.

1389
02:07:36,510 --> 02:07:37,680
伸手  該死
Come on!

1390
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:42,080
再來 好  快點  過來  撐住  近點
- Come on, reach! Come on! - Reach!

1391
02:07:45,650 --> 02:07:46,990
抓住他  拉他上來  用力
- Pull him up! - Pull!

1392
02:07:48,650 --> 02:07:49,700
上來
Come on!

1393
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:51,560
快呀
Come on!

1394
02:07:57,800 --> 02:07:59,300
特瑞莎
Teresa!

1395
02:08:15,450 --> 02:08:16,720
不
No!

1396
02:12:00,210 --> 02:12:02,340
我們經歷了漫長的征途
We have come a long way together.

1397
02:12:03,480 --> 02:12:06,810
無數人犧牲了生命
So many have sacrificed so much

1398
02:12:06,810 --> 02:12:08,680
才最終建立了這個家園
to make this place possible.

1399
02:12:10,050 --> 02:12:11,550
有我們的朋友
Your friends

1400
02:12:13,050 --> 02:12:14,260
我們的家人
and your family.

1401
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:20,160
這一杯敬沒能在這兒的夥伴
So here's to the ones who couldn't be here.

1402
02:12:20,160 --> 02:12:21,900
敬我們失去的朋友
Here's to the friends we lost.

1403
02:12:24,700 --> 02:12:27,840
這堿O你們的歸宿  所有人的家
This place is for you. It's for all of us.

1404
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:30,570
但是這個
But this,

1405
02:12:31,410 --> 02:12:33,340
是他們的長眠之處
this is for them.

1406
02:12:34,540 --> 02:12:37,950
所以用你們自己的時間 用你們自己的方式
So, in your own time, in your own way,

1407
02:12:39,510 --> 02:12:41,420
找到平靜吧
come make your peace.

1408
02:12:43,550 --> 02:12:45,850
歡迎來到避風港
And welcome to the Safe Haven.

1409
02:13:04,170 --> 02:13:05,510
想吃東西嗎
You all want some food?

1410
02:13:09,710 --> 02:13:11,980
這媟|成為我們安穩的家
This is gonna be a good home for us.

1411
02:13:15,950 --> 02:13:16,990
是啊
Yeah.

1412
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:33,300
你昏迷的時候還拿著這個
You had this on you while you were passed out.

1413
02:13:38,110 --> 02:13:40,510
我保管得還不錯吧
Figured I'd keep it safe for ya.

1414
02:13:44,180 --> 02:13:46,080
謝謝  米諾
Thanks, Minho.

1415
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:49,950
待會見
See you out there.

1416
02:13:49,950 --> 02:13:51,690
待會見
See ya.

1417
02:14:46,240 --> 02:14:48,170
親愛的托馬斯
Dear Thomas...

1418
02:14:48,180 --> 02:14:51,910
這是我有記憶以來寫的第一封信
This is the first letter I can remember writing.

1419
02:14:51,910 --> 02:14:55,680
雖然我不知道進迷宮之前我有沒有寫過
Obviously, I don't know if I wrote any before the maze.

1420
02:14:55,680 --> 02:15:00,990
但是即使這不是我寫的第一封 這也應該是最後一封
But even if it's not my first, it's likely to be my last.

1421
02:15:00,990 --> 02:15:03,760
我想讓你知道  我不曾害怕
I want you to know that I'm not scared.

1422
02:15:04,690 --> 02:15:06,490
至少我怕的不是死亡
Well, not of dying, anyway.

1423
02:15:06,490 --> 02:15:09,430
而是忘卻
It's more forgetting.

1424
02:15:09,430 --> 02:15:11,330
病毒奪走我的記憶
It's losing myself to this virus.

1425
02:15:11,330 --> 02:15:13,400
才是我最為害怕的
That's what scares me.

1426
02:15:16,940 --> 02:15:19,910
所以我每晚都大聲念出他們的名字
So every night I've been saying their names out loud.

1427
02:15:19,910 --> 02:15:21,210
艾爾比
Alby...

1428
02:15:21,210 --> 02:15:23,180
溫斯頓  查克
Winston, Chuck.

1429
02:15:24,710 --> 02:15:26,850
一遍又一遍地重複著
And I just repeat them over and over,

1430
02:15:26,850 --> 02:15:29,220
像做禱告一樣
like a prayer,

1431
02:15:29,220 --> 02:15:31,150
然後記憶就會湧現出來
and it all comes flooding back.

1432
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:35,790
都是些小事
Just the little things, like the way

1433
02:15:35,790 --> 02:15:36,960
比如夕陽
the sun used to hit the Glade

1434
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:39,160
沉下高牆前
at that perfect moment right before

1435
02:15:39,160 --> 02:15:41,560
餘暉掛在林間空地的那一剎那
it slipped beneath the walls.

1436
02:15:41,560 --> 02:15:45,200
我還想起了煎鍋燉的菜
And I remember the taste of Frypan's stew.

1437
02:15:45,200 --> 02:15:47,570
想不到我會這麼懷念那東西
I never thought I'd miss that stuff so much.

1438
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:52,770
我也會想起你
And I remember you.

1439
02:15:52,770 --> 02:15:55,140
記得你一開始走出籠子
I remember the first time you came up in the Box.

1440
02:15:55,140 --> 02:15:56,540
還是個驚慌失措
Just a scared little Greenie

1441
02:15:56,550 --> 02:15:58,680
連名字都想不起來的小子
who couldn't even remember his own name.

1442
02:15:59,780 --> 02:16:01,550
但從你衝進迷宮的那一刻起
But from that moment you ran into the maze,

1443
02:16:01,550 --> 02:16:03,990
我就知道我會追隨你
I knew I would follow you anywhere.

1444
02:16:05,560 --> 02:16:07,120
我做到了
And I have.

1445
02:16:09,060 --> 02:16:10,930
我們都做到了
We all have.

1446
02:16:14,430 --> 02:16:16,630
如果有機會我能重新來過
If I could do it all over again, I would

1447
02:16:16,630 --> 02:16:21,600
我還會做出同樣的選擇
and I wouldn't change a thing.

1448
02:16:21,600 --> 02:16:24,840
而我也希望
And my hope for you

1449
02:16:24,840 --> 02:16:26,810
等你多年後回想起來的時候
is that when you're looking back years from now,

1450
02:16:26,810 --> 02:16:29,110
你也能說出同樣的話
you'll be able to say the same.

1451
02:16:31,950 --> 02:16:35,610
未來就在你手中了  托馬斯
The future's in your hands now, Tommy.

1452
02:16:35,620 --> 02:16:38,150
我相信你會找到正確的道路的
And I know you'll find a way to do what's right.

1453
02:16:39,590 --> 02:16:41,160
你一定能的
You always have.

1454
02:16:43,190 --> 02:16:45,030
幫我照顧好大家
Take care of everyone for me.

1455
02:16:46,630 --> 02:16:48,600
也照顧好你自己
And take care of yourself.

1456
02:16:50,470 --> 02:16:52,730
你值得擁有幸福
You deserve to be happy.

1457
02:16:56,140 --> 02:16:58,110
多謝你做我的朋友
Thank you for being my friend.

1458
02:17:01,080 --> 02:17:03,140
再見了  兄弟
Goodbye, mate.

1459
02:17:03,150 --> 02:17:04,190
紐特
Newt.
