porta potty out back and...</i>

479
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,540
I think that'd be cruel
and unusual punishment, right?

480
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:11,450
Well, I'll be sure 'n give 'em a
good whup for it on Monday, though.

481
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,520
All right.

482
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,690
Thank you.

483
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,480
Front door's open.

484
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,620
Shh, it's okay.

485
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,460
That's an easy fix.

486
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,520
I gotta...

487
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,650
Get in. Come on.

488
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,490
Oh, shit.

489
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,560
We gotta make this quick.

490
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:36,470
She might leave me
before I get back.

491
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:48,610
So, this is all yours.

492
00:36:48,615 --> 00:36:51,520
Including everything between
here and your house.

493
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,580
Almost 2,000 acres.

494
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,550
What do you think?

495
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,420
I own all this?

496
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,460
Oh, yeah.

497
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,570
This whole airport?

498
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,660
Yeah. Congratulations.

499
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,460
AK-47s.

500
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:41,370
Soviet-made for the PLO.

501
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:46,530
The Israelis captured these,
and then secretly traded them to us.

502
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,480
And you're gonna
fly them to Nicaragua.

503
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,640
Uh, you didn't say
nothin' 'bout guns.

504
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,410
It's a war, Barry.

505
00:37:55,415 --> 00:37:58,580
Freedom fighters can't put up
much of a fight if they aren't armed.

506
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,550
This was the deal.

507
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,450
Or would you rather be
in a Colombian prison?

508
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:10,530
This is every current law enforcement
investigation in the Gulf Coast.

509
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:14,430
FBI, ATF, DEA, Customs.

510
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,430
These maps will help you
avoid all of 'em.

511
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,670
Holy shit.

512
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:24,510
You just fly where they ain't.

513
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,390
Everything in this hangar's mine.

514
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,450
Oh, yeah.

515
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,530
That truck's mine.

516
00:38:44,535 --> 00:38:45,555
Mm-hmm.

517
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,400
- Tools are mine.
- Yes, sir.

518
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:50,440
This airplane is mine.

519
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,540
Bag is mine.

520
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,510
What bag?

521
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,560
I fed the kids.
They're sleepin'.

522
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,380
I unpacked the car.

523
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,700
That is good.

524
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,610
Fixed the sink.
Just the valve.

525
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,650
See, I told you,
that was gonna be easy.

526
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,580
Fuck, Barry!

527
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,590
Okay, all right, all right.
Okay.

528
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,390
Ima come clean.

529
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,030
I don't work for TWA
no more.

530
00:39:50,035 --> 00:39:53,330
No shit, Barry.
Are you going to prison?

531
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,160
No, ma'am.

532
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,490
You gotta take care
of this family.

533
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,670
'Cause I will take the kids.

534
00:40:02,675 --> 00:40:05,470
I will go right back to working
for Kentucky Fried Chicken.

535
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,600
Luce, what I'm workin' on...

536
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:10,380
- Barry, I'm six months pregnant.
- It's top secret.

537
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:11,570
I need a fridge.

538
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,520
I need beds for our children.

539
00:40:13,525 --> 00:40:16,510
I need a stove,
a fucking washing machine.

540
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,180
Washing machine over there.

541
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,060
Let me just...

542
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,270
Is this all legal?

543
00:40:39,275 --> 00:40:44,070
All right, what I'm about to tell you...
Now, you-you...

544
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:48,270
You gotta swear you can't
ever tell anybody this, Lucy.

545
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,140
All right?

546
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:59,050
I am working...
for the CIA.

547
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:06,730
<i>Hola!</i>

548
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,720
Howdy, <i>amigos</i>.

549
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:12,660
I'm here on behalf
of Uncle Sam.

550
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:26,570
Look, Schafer.
I ain't no military expert,

551
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,700
but are you sure
these are the right guys?

552
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:31,410
'Cause they seem a damn sight
more interested in my boots

553
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:32,610
than in your guns.

554
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,640
<i>Look, this is getting big time.</i>

555
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,650
<i>Schafer, I just don't think
I'm the guy for this.</i>

556
00:42:36,655 --> 00:42:38,820
You just keep delivering
that pizza, you hear me?

557
00:42:38,825 --> 00:42:40,320
<i>You just keep delivering.</i>

558
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:55,160
<i>Hola.</i> All right.

559
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:57,800
These are gifts.

560
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:00,630
All right?

561
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:05,810
All right? Gifts.
<i>Regalos de mi.</i>

562
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,750
Back off. Off.

563
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,660
<i>Regalos.</i>

564
00:43:13,965 --> 00:43:15,100
<i>Amigos.</i>

565
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:16,700
<i>Atras, atras.</i>

566
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,620
Now, these guns
are gifts from Uncle Sam.

567
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,370
I'm not fuckin' around.

568
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:37,805
Barry! Put the bat down, <i>huevon!</i>

569
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:39,750
We're all friends here.

570
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:43,720
Jorge.
What the hell are you doing here?

571
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:45,690
This is Don Adolfo Calero.

572
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,460
He works for your
government on the revolution

573
00:43:48,465 --> 00:43:49,660
to bring down the Sandinistas.

574
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:52,420
Jorge tells me you are
the crazy gringo

575
00:43:52,425 --> 00:43:53,820
who always delivers.

576
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:57,700
We have a new business
proposition to you, Barry.

577
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:00,640
You bring your American
guns to Colombia,

578
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,800
deliver our cocaine here
to the Contras,

579
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,700
the Contras take it by
fishing boats to Miami,

580
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,680
and everybody's happy.

581
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:14,280
It's for the war effort, Mr. Seal.

582
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,480
<i>Lucho Castellanos y su Grupo -
"Bombo y Maracas"</i>

583
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:18,710
<i>Turns out the Contras didn't really
want to fight a war.</i>

584
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:21,780
<i>They just want to make money.
Like the rest of us.</i>

585
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:25,790
<i>Meanwhile, the Medellin Cartel
wanted guns.</i>

586
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,800
<i>So they worked out
a little trade.</i>

587
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,000
<i>What was I gonna tell 'em?</i>

588
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:32,770
I'm just a gringo
who always delivers.

589
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,570
<i>Here's how the operation worked.</i>

590
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,600
<i>I'd load up the guns at Mena.</i>

591
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,670
<i>Then, using Schafer's intel,
I'd bypass any law enforcement</i>

592
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:45,370
<i>and fly straight to the
Cartel's airstrip in Medellin.</i>

593
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,190
<i>Colombians, well,
they love them guns.</i>

594
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,225
<i>Then I'd load up with fresh powder</i>

595
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:56,330
<i>and fly on to the
Contra training camp.</i>

596
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:01,320
<i>The Contras hid the coke in
fishing boats and sailed it up to Miami.</i>

597
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:04,260
<i>Meanwhile, I'd get
another load of powder,</i>

598
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,430
<i>take it back to the States
with a quick stop to refuel in Panama,</i>

599
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,270
<i>under the protection of
my old friend, Colonel Noriega.</i>

600
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:13,470
Congratulations on your
promotion, General.

601
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,340
<i>Of course, he'd get his cut too.</i>

602
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,480
<i>On the way back,
I'd keep an eye out for the DEA.</i>

603
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,380
<i>Then I'd dump it all
in the swamps in Louisiana.</i>

604
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:31,250
<i>The operation got so big,
I had to get some help.</i>

605
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:34,390
<i>Pete Dubois, manufactured guns
until he discovered</i>

606
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,330
<i>he had a knack for selling pot.</i>

607
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:40,200
<i>Stan Mason flew dope from
Mexico to Arizona.</i>

608
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,330
<i>Bill Cooper,</i>

609
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:45,210
<i>he flew opium all around
Southeast Asia during Vietnam.</i>

610
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,210
<i>Then there's Bob.</i>

611
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,370
<i>Uh, I don't know much about Bob.
Hell of a pilot, though.</i>

612
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,380
<i>I call these boys my Snowbirds.</i>

613
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,410
<i>And we could fly through anything.</i>

614
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,170
Schafer.

615
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:24,470
Barry.

616
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,310
How's it going?

617
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:29,210
Hey Boss!

618
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,220
That was fucking crazy, man!

619
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:38,390
How's it uh,
how's it going down there?

620
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,320
Oh, you know...

621
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:42,250
Busy.

622
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,230
You?

623
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,300
Oh, yeah.

624
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:51,270
Busy.

625
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,220
Where are they going?

626
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:05,310
We need to borrow some
of your land.

627
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:11,320
They want you to
fly 'em up here to-to train.

628
00:47:11,325 --> 00:47:13,255
For training.

629
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,420
Who?

630
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:16,390
The Contras.

631
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,330
You want me to
bring 'em up here?

632
00:47:23,335 --> 00:47:24,505
To me?

633
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:27,410
We're setting up a
field and operational training ground.

634
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,380
Where? On...

635
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:37,420
- My land?
- Yeah.

636
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:39,450
Starting immediately.

637
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,250

Stop runnin'!

957
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:40,180
Fuck!

958
01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:05,305
Sorry, it's my wife.

959
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:08,180
- Hey Luce, you hear me?
<i>- Yes.</i>

960
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:10,280
- Honey? You all right?
<i>- Yeah, I can hear you.</i>

961
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:13,290
Honey, I hate to tell you this
right now, but JB's been arrested.

962
01:10:13,295 --> 01:10:15,090
- That little shit.
<i>- What happened?</i>

963
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,030
I don't know. He got caught
with a lot of money.

964
01:10:17,230 --> 01:10:18,830
- That dumbfuck.
<i>- Honey...</i>

965
01:10:18,835 --> 01:10:20,220
What do you want
me to do here, babe?

966
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:22,230
There ain't
nothin' to do, really.

967
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:23,500
Uh, I'm just in a meeting.

968
01:10:23,505 --> 01:10:25,200
And we'll go over that
when I get home.

969
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:27,160
All right? I got-
I'll take care of that.

970
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,170
- All right?
<i>- All right, hurry up, Barry.</i>

971
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,070
You just sit tight.
I love you.

972
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:35,270
How much?<i> Cuanto?</i>

975
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:44,140
1500?

976
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:46,090
<i>Si.</i> In one go.

977
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:48,180
In one go?

978
01:10:48,485 --> 01:10:50,620
<i>Si.</i>

979
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:53,150
Well, we ain't never
done that before.

980
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,360
Sanctuary isn't cheap.

981
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,230
That's a lot

982
01:10:57,260 --> 01:10:58,360
Can you do it?

983
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:02,300
Yeah, I'm gonna get home...

984
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:05,330
Right now. I'm gonna leave.
Then uh, we'll figure it out.

985
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:07,140
I'll figure it out.

986
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:16,110
Get it fucking done.

987
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:21,250
Fucking lawyer
doesn't know shit.

988
01:11:21,290 --> 01:11:24,280
I got two fucking priors, man.
And he doesn't understand.

989
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:26,320
No, no, no.
He does understand.

990
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:28,490
And you gotta do
what he tells you to do.

991
01:11:28,495 --> 01:11:29,990
<i>No, he doesn't, man.</i>

992
01:11:30,295 --> 01:11:33,190
<i>One more strike, man. One more
strike and I can go to prison...</i>

993
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:34,360
<i>- for-for life, man.</i>
- JB.

994
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,300
JB, just...
hold on.

995
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:41,370
Barry?
Barry, are you there?

996
01:11:42,110 --> 01:11:43,270
Daddy!

997
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:44,370
Hey, darlin'.

998
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:47,210
What's that?
Hold on.

999
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:48,340
- Yeah?
<i>- Barry.</i>

1000
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:50,520
We've been trying
to get a hold of you, <i>amigo.</i>

1001
01:11:50,525 --> 01:11:53,080
<i>Yeah, I know that, amigo. Listen,
could you hold on, I'll be right back.</i>

1002
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:01,260
- JB?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1003
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:03,360
<i>There's some people
that wanna talk to me.</i>

1004
01:12:03,365 --> 01:12:08,130
No, no no. You don't talk to
anyone about anything.

1005
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:09,660
<i>Now, you do what that
lawyer tells you to.</i>

1006
01:12:09,665 --> 01:12:11,160
<i>And you keep your
fucking mouth shut.</i>

1007
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:13,370
<i>- I'm taking care of this.</i>
- Okay.

1008
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:19,300
Listen, Jorge, we gotta put on
the brakes for a bit.

1009
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,000
Brakes? No, no, no.
No brakes.

1010
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:23,100
<i>We have product to move.</i>

1011
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:25,280
I understand <i>amigo</i>,
but I-I got a family situation.

1012
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:28,280
<i>Eh, your brother-in-law.
We know all about it.</i>

1013
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:31,160
<i>- We'll handle it, amigo.</i>
- No, no, no, no.

1014
01:12:31,165 --> 01:12:34,360
- I don't want you to handle it.
<i>- Barry, listen.</i>

1015
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:37,230
- I got it. I got this.
- Barry, listen to me.

1016
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:41,200
We'll handle it, okay?
So don't worry.

1017
01:12:41,205 --> 01:12:43,300
<i>- We'll talk business later.</i>
- Jorge...

1018
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:15,300
Barry, they don-they don't know
about them suitcases you got.

1019
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:16,840
or what you got in them planes,
the guns you got.

1020
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,140
They don't know anything about it.

1021
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:20,270
We're good, man.

1022
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:23,140
I can't fix this.
You hear?

1023
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:28,180
They're gonna give you 10-
10 years for not talkin'.

1024
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:30,310
That's 10 years people
gotta worry you will.

1025
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:32,200
I didn't say anything, man.

1026
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,220
You can talk to the goddamn lawyer.

1027
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:39,320
Where we going, man?

1028
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:47,200
You serious?
I'm fucking family.

1029
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:52,330
We're family!

1030
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:59,250
That's right. Right.
We're a family.

1031
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:04,240
- What's that?
- Inside's a passport...

1032
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:07,220
first-class ticket to
Bora Bora and enough cash...

1033
01:14:07,390 --> 01:14:10,220
Enough cash to make
a damn good life for yourself.

1034
01:14:11,265 --> 01:14:12,400
Now, you're gonna
get in that car,

1035
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:17,104
and you're gonna drive straight
to Dallas Fort Worth Airport

1036
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:18,860
and nowhere else.

1037
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:22,360
You don't even
stop to take a piss.

1038
01:14:22,370 --> 01:14:25,340
- You hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you.

1039
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,340
Good luck, kid.

1040
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:43,190
I'll tell you what, Barry.

1041
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:46,160
I'm gonna send you a
goddamn address, okay, Barry?

1042
01:14:46,165 --> 01:14:49,280
You're gonna start sending
me cash on the fucking regular.

1043
01:14:49,285 --> 01:14:52,160
You understand?
You hear me?

1044
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:02,180
Oh, and Barry...

1045
01:15:02,185 --> 01:15:05,300
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you and my cunt sister!

1046
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:12,140
Hey!

1047
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:15,150
Money every week, asshole!

1048
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:28,360
What the fuck?

1049
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:37,280
What?
Oh, shit.

1050
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,250
Hey, hey! Barry!

1051
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:29,190
Hey, Barry!

1052
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,220
Barry!

1053
01:16:31,225 --> 01:16:32,920
Yeah, Bill, what do you need?
What do you need?

1054
01:16:32,925 --> 01:16:34,520
Man, man, I'm like
freakin' out, man.

1055
01:16:34,525 --> 01:16:36,330
What is goin' on with JB?

1056
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:40,330
- Huh?
- Don't worry about JB.

1057
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:42,280
What if he talks, man?

1058
01:16:42,285 --> 01:16:46,140
- He ain't gonna.
- Yeah, but what if he does?

1059
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:50,210
- He ain't gonna talk, Bill.
- How do you know?

1060
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:53,310
I am fucking positive.

1061
01:16:58,130 --> 01:16:59,390
Okay, man.

1062
01:16:59,395 --> 01:17:02,160
Good, I'm gonna trust
you on this one, man.

1063
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,360
Good.

1064
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:12,600
<i>In calendar year, your
operations have transported</i>

1065
01:17:12,605 --> 01:17:15,300
10,500 Russian AKs
to the Contras.

1066
01:17:15,305 --> 01:17:16,400
Yeah.

1067
01:17:16,405 --> 01:17:20,450
5,000 of which, have found
themselves in the hands

1068
01:17:20,455 --> 01:17:22,115
of the Colombian Cartel.

1069
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,640
- Right, but...
- Out of the 916 Contras

1070
01:17:24,645 --> 01:17:27,250
brought in to the
United States to train,

1071
01:17:27,255 --> 01:17:29,250
only half made it back
to Nicaragua.

1072
01:17:29,255 --> 01:17:32,380
- Half is...
- The other half are in the wild...

1073
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,140
What's going on here?

1074
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:03,150
Oh, yeah. We had to send
the Contras home.

1075
01:18:03,190 --> 01:18:05,390
- Home?
- Yeah.

1076
01:18:05,695 --> 01:18:07,480
They weren't fighting.

1077
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:10,300
That's the reality
of that situation.

1078
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:16,190
You know, it didn't help that
their guns were in Colombia.

1079
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,630
Did it, Barry?

1080
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:31,120
So...

1081
01:18:34,290 --> 01:18:36,070
What now?

1082
01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:38,170
We'll call you.

1083
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:43,390
Call me?
Schafer?

1084
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,800
Hey, Schafer.

1085
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,550
Who the fuck's Schafer?

1086
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:56,210
Okay, everybody.
You know the drill.

1087
01:18:56,215 --> 01:18:57,700
Everybody gets a burn bag.

1088
01:18:57,710 --> 01:19:00,240
Into it, you put anything
with Barry Seal's face

1089
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:02,310
or name on it.

1090
01:19:05,190 --> 01:19:06,750
Come on, boys.
We gotta move.

1091
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:09,350
We gotta get all this
stuff outta here.

1092
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:13,070
- Pete. What, everything?
- Come on, boys, lets go.

1093
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,160
We gotta move this out.
Let's go! Let's go!

1094
01:19:15,165 --> 01:19:17,260
Into the burn bag, go!

1095
01:19:17,265 --> 01:19:20,300
Purchase orders,
aircraft invoices,

1096
01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:23,150
Need a team here,
let's move it out.

1097
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:26,160
Oh, shit, man.
Look at all these guns.

1098
01:19:26,170 --> 01:19:27,610
We gotta move all of it.

1099
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:29,110
Where are we supposed
to put all this stuff?

1100
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:30,300
Just get it off my property.

1101
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:32,250
Anything with the words "Mena".

1102
01:19:32,255 --> 01:19:38,190
Fuel bills, memos, names,
directives, photos, anything like that,

1103
01:19:38,195 --> 01:19:40,180
anything that can link us with him,
you put in the burn bag...

1104
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:42,280
and then what do you do with it?

1105
01:19:42,285 --> 01:19:43,740
- Burn it.
- You burn it.

1106
01:19:44,345 --> 01:19:46,250
Bob, I need a little help
back here.

1107
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:49,290
- Gimme a hand with this shit.
- You got it.

1108
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:56,370

Miss Sibota,
I have Governor Clinton on the line.

1138
01:21:47,350 --> 01:21:48,680
He says it's urgent.

1139
01:21:53,390 --> 01:21:55,180
It's...the Governor.

1140
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,380
It's the Governor.

1141
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:02,290
Put him through. Clear the room.
Take him with you.

1142
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:06,360
Yeah?
What do you need, Bill?

1143
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,340
Did you all know

1144
01:22:07,345 --> 01:22:08,760
that Caddies have more trunk space

1145
01:22:08,765 --> 01:22:10,400
than any other car in the world?

1146
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:13,230
I'll give each and
every one of you a Caddy.

1147
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:17,060
- Huh?
- You'd do that for all of us?

1148
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:18,260
Yes, sir, I would.

1149

I'd get all ya'll Caddies.
Have 'em here this afternoon.

1150
01:22:21,025 --> 01:22:23,275
What're you tryin' to do, Seal?
Add another 20 for bribery?

1151
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,220
Oh, no, no, no. I'm just offerin'
you Caddies for your troubles.

1152
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:27,120
What trouble, Seal?

1153
01:22:27,125 --> 01:22:29,180
Well, bringing me down here, for one.

Or you can always
tell us to fuck off
