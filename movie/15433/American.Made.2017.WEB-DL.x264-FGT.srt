deliver our cocaine here to the Contras,

the Contras take it by fishing boats to Miami,

and everybody's happy.

Turns out the Contras didn't really want to fight a war.

557
00:44:18,954 --> 00:44:21,943

They just want to make money. Like the rest of us.

558
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:25,953

Meanwhile, the Medellin Cartel wanted guns.

00:44:25,993 --> 00:44:28,965
×ÖÄ»
So they worked out a little trade.

560
00:44:29,105 --> 00:44:30,165
×ÖÄ»
What was I gonna tell 'em?

561
00:44:30,195 --> 00:44:32,934

I'm just a gringo who always delivers.

Here's how the operation worked.

563
00:44:35,804 --> 00:44:37,765
×ÖÄ»
I'd load up the guns at Mena.

564
00:44:37,805 --> 00:44:41,838
×ÖÄ»
Then, using Schafer's intel, I'd bypass any law enforcement

565
00:44:41,878 --> 00:44:45,539
×ÖÄ»
and fly straight to the Cartel's airstrip in Medellin.

00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:50,362

Colombians, well, they love them guns.

567
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:53,393

Then I'd load up with fresh powder

568
00:44:53,398 --> 00:44:56,499
×ÖÄ»
and fly on to the Contra training camp.

569
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:58,885
×ÖÄ»
The Contras hid the coke

570
00:44:58,886 --> 00:45:01,492
×ÖÄ»
in fishing boats and sailed it up to Miami.

571
00:45:02,443 --> 00:45:04,432
×ÖÄ»
Meanwhile, I'd get another load of powder,

572
00:45:04,472 --> 00:45:07,602
×ÖÄ»
take it back to the States with a quick stop to refuel in Panama,

under the protection of my old friend, Colonel Noriega.

Of course, he'd get his cut too.

576
00:45:17,456 --> 00:45:19,657

On the way back, I'd keep an eye out for the DEA.

577
00:45:20,397 --> 00:45:22,556
×ÖÄ»
Then I'd dump it all in the swamps in Louisiana.

578
00:45:27,437 --> 00:45:31,429
×ÖÄ»
The operation got so big, I had to get some help.
