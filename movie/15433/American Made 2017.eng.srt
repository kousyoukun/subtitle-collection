Walter Murphy -
"A Fifth of Beethoven"

2
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:26,421
Exactly three years ago,

3
00:00:26,622 --> 00:00:28,819
I promised you a president

4
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:32,175
who feels your pain
and who shares your dreams.

5
00:00:35,737 --> 00:00:39,394
I want to talk to you
about a fundamental threat

6
00:00:39,604 --> 00:00:42,036
to American democracy.

7
00:00:48,273 --> 00:00:50,558
For the first time
in the history of our country,

8
00:00:50,563 --> 00:00:52,411
a majority of our people believe

9
00:00:52,816 --> 00:00:55,112
that the next five years

10
00:00:55,618 --> 00:00:59,015
will be worse than
the past five years.

11
00:01:04,718 --> 00:01:07,434
Alpha, Alpha 15 uh,
tell us your route course.

12
00:01:09,115 --> 00:01:12,534
Yeah, Alpha, Alpha 15
at November for time at Delta Delta.

13
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:13,734
Shit.

14
00:01:15,954 --> 00:01:17,855
Howdy, folks.

15
00:01:18,815 --> 00:01:20,845
I apologize for the delay.

16
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:23,823
We're at number 11 for take off.

17
00:01:23,993 --> 00:01:25,965
We'll try to make it up
in the air.

18
00:01:27,866 --> 00:01:29,556
Just wake me up over Texas.

19
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:26,427
Apologies from the flight deck.

20
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,869
Just a little bit of turbulence.

21
00:02:35,912 --> 00:02:38,810
Thank you all for flying
TWA tonight.

22
00:02:38,852 --> 00:02:40,711
Welcome to Baton Rouge.

23
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:41,981
The people's choice.

24
00:02:44,852 --> 00:02:48,764
And for you history buffs
is in Louisiana.

What's that?

Barry Seal.

57
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:39,256
That's right.

58
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,336
You have a...

59
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:46,789
drop off and pick up service
here every other Thursday.

60
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,280
Cuban exiles.

61
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,078
They pay commercial pilots
to smuggle homegrown contraband

00:04:54,108 --> 00:04:58,051
through Canadian hubs.
Vancouver, Montreal.

63
00:04:58,081 --> 00:04:59,782
Right?

64
00:05:00,252 --> 00:05:02,865
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

65
00:05:03,063 --> 00:05:04,222
- No?
- No.

66
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:06,193
You're smuggling cigars.

67
00:05:10,831 --> 00:05:13,263
You have an
interesting file, Barry.

68
00:05:14,173 --> 00:05:15,234
File?

69
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:16,294
Starts off with a bang.

70
00:05:16,374 --> 00:05:18,346
Top of your class
in the Civil Air Patrol.

71
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:21,346
Youngest pilot in TWA history.

72
00:05:21,351 --> 00:05:23,965
You were going places.

73
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:26,286
What is goin' on here?

74
00:05:27,256 --> 00:05:29,347
Revolution is in the air, Barry.

75
00:05:30,157 --> 00:05:32,348
Central America, right now.

76
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:35,259
We're building nations
down there, Barry.

77
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,058
We're building nations.

78
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:40,189
It's America at its fuckin' finest.

79
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,099
And we could use someone like you.

80
00:05:48,712 --> 00:05:50,302
God damn.

81
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,510
You're CIA.

82
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,871
Shhh.

83
00:05:58,523 --> 00:06:00,004
Holy shit.

84
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:03,895
Hot damn.
Look at her.

85
00:06:04,206 --> 00:06:09,135
Well, they uh,
they tell me she's pretty fast.

86
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:12,165
Yeah. Yeah.

87
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:15,406
The fastest
twin engine on the planet.

88
00:06:16,147 --> 00:06:18,118
I mean, shit.

89
00:06:18,618 --> 00:06:22,748
She looks like she's goin' 300
miles an hour just sittin' there.

90
00:06:25,828 --> 00:06:27,659
CIA owns this?

91
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,751
No. No.

92
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:32,821
Uh, Independent Aviation Consultants.

93
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:37,573
- IAC.
- Yeah.

94
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:43,041
What is that? What do they call
one of them front groups, is it?

95
00:06:43,242 --> 00:06:45,453
No, no, no.
It's as real as IBM.

96
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,654
Uh-huh.

97
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:50,136
You'd run the company, but
after hours, you work for us.

98
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:54,343
Yup.

99
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,284
It takes pictures?

100
00:06:56,314 --> 00:06:59,217
Mm-hmm.
We say it collects intelligence.

101
00:06:59,517 --> 00:07:00,887
Uh-huh.

102
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:04,838
Where?
Russia?

103
00:07:04,848 --> 00:07:08,793
Uh, south of the border.
North of the equator.

104
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:10,489
Let's just say uh...

105
00:07:10,494 --> 00:07:12,308
Enemies of democracy.

106
00:07:12,508 --> 00:07:16,430
Look, the real work is covert.
You understand?

107
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:18,751
- So, so uh...
- "Covert".

108
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:20,853
Anyone finds out about it, uh...

109
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:24,569
Family, friends, even uh, Lucy.
It's Lucy, right?

110
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,871
Yeah, that's right.

111
00:07:29,403 --> 00:07:31,233
That'd be a problem.

112
00:07:35,145 --> 00:07:38,107
- What?
- All this is legal?

113
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,835
If you're doin' it for the good guys...
yeah.

114
00:07:43,285 --> 00:07:47,576
Just don't get caught.
You wanna take it for a spin?

115
00:07:47,987 --> 00:07:49,958
Fuck it.
Take it for a fucking spin.

116
00:07:49,988 --> 00:07:53,985
I want you to
take her for a spin.

117
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:18,724
It's all for me.

118
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,355
It's a new business.
It's gonna be my business.

119
00:08:21,365 --> 00:08:24,662
- Okay, logistical support for airports.
- That's right.

120
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:27,424
Okay.
And you're callin' it IAC?

121
00:08:28,505 --> 00:08:31,376
What do you know about business?

122
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:38,650
You are a TWA airline pilot.

123
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:41,213
That's how you support this family.

124
00:08:41,218 --> 00:08:43,112
This is gonna be good for us.

125
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:45,048
What about benefits?

126
00:08:45,188 --> 00:08:46,379
Our healthcare?

127
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,916
And we have great
healthcare with TWA.

128
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:52,537
Um, you know, I'm sure that's
not gonna be a problem.

129
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:55,259
And what the hell does
IAC mean, anyway?

130
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,401
Independent Aviation Consultants.

131
00:09:01,412 --> 00:09:04,283
Well, that sounds fuckin'
made up, Barry.

132
00:09:06,355 --> 00:09:07,516
It does?

133

144
00:09:31,818 --> 00:09:36,611
- Barry? Radius transponder radar.
- Yeah, check, check.

145
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:40,521
- Rudder aileron trim.

Closed.

Flight attendant briefing.

149
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:51,963
Uh, Barry?

150
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:54,771
You gonna be all right, Jimmy.

151
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:57,913
Where are you-
where are you going?

152
00:09:59,985 --> 00:10:04,716
Barry!
Barry, where are you going?

153
00:10:05,786 --> 00:10:07,917
Shit. I know, I know.

154
00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:09,925
That was bold.

155
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:12,056
That was bold.

156
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:15,127
I do tend to leap before I look.

157
00:10:16,738 --> 00:10:17,999
Maybe uh...

158
00:10:21,111 --> 00:10:23,981
Maybe I should've asked
a few more questions.

159
00:10:25,178 --> 00:10:27,940
Anyways, back in '78, in uh...

160
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,981
September?
October.

161
00:10:32,991 --> 00:10:34,922
Anyway, it uh...

162
00:10:36,923 --> 00:10:40,462
That was the day
I joined the CIA.

163
00:10:40,663 --> 00:10:44,164
The Allman Brothers -
"One Way Out"

164
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:53,666
Now, in those days,
the cold war was in full swing.

165
00:10:54,714 --> 00:10:55,715
The Soviets were backing

166
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:58,737
communist insurgents

00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:07,821

00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:38,937
They're mine.

174
00:11:39,137 --> 00:11:41,035
- Hey, Monty.

Jay Ramsey -
"Call Me Free"

184
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,710
So uh, so then
I show him this one.

185
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,253
And he goes uh, "Goddammit, Schafer,
I didn't ask for mug shots."

186
00:12:54,092 --> 00:12:56,255
I mean, they said they're

187
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,822
the best reconnaissance photos
they have ever seen.

188
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:01,824
So, does this mean
I get a raise?

189
00:13:02,024 --> 00:13:03,123
You're doing great.

190
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:06,235
You got a family, Schafer?

191
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,146
Big push!

192
00:13:08,151 --> 00:13:10,208
Ah, motherfucker!

00:13:16,055 --> 00:13:21,148
See, I uh, I didn't tell Lucy
I ain't workin' for TWA no more.

195
00:13:23,227 --> 00:13:25,029
You're serving your country.

196
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:31,970
I am gonna need
some more money at some point.

197
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:34,230
You'll figure it out.

198
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:36,971
Oh, uh...

199
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:41,101
We uh, we're sending you
to Panama tomorrow.

200
00:13:41,251 --> 00:13:44,121
The CIA was so happy
with my work,

201
00:13:44,251 --> 00:13:46,192
they gave me another job.

202
00:13:47,052 --> 00:13:48,113
Bag man.

203
00:13:49,054 --> 00:13:52,085
See, there was this
Colonel down in Panama

204
00:13:52,195 --> 00:13:54,095
named Noriega.

205
00:13:56,104 --> 00:13:59,124
And he was selling the Agency's intel
on all the commies down there.

206
00:13:59,165 --> 00:14:01,006
For your friends.

207
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:05,047
My job was just to
drop off and pick up.

208
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:09,650
Just drop off.

209
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,048

238
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:39,252
Or is it CIA?

239
00:16:39,462 --> 00:16:45,962
What? No, no, no.
I'm just a businessman here.

We decided to try new ideas.

261
00:18:02,487 --> 00:18:05,318
We want you
to take off from here.

262
00:18:05,323 --> 00:18:07,459
Fly directly to Miami.

263

We'll pay you $2,000 per kilo.

264
00:18:16,469 --> 00:18:18,530
How much is a kilo?

00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:21,832
2.2 pounds, Mr. Seal.

266
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:32,514
$2,000...

267
00:18:33,754 --> 00:18:35,715
every 2.2 pounds.

268
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:42,495
I'm sorry, fellas.

269
00:18:42,795 --> 00:18:45,494

A couple of billion
dollars from now,

274
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:55,439
they'd be known as
the Medellin Cartel.

275
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:57,180
See, back then, they're just
three businessmen

276
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:58,673
tryin' to figure out
how to get their

277
00:18:58,678 --> 00:19:01,479
merchandise to the United States.

278
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:04,840
There was just
one small problem.

279
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:05,980
See, pilots, they were

280
00:19:05,985 --> 00:19:09,362
killin' themselves tryin'
to get off that runway.

281
00:19:09,372 --> 00:19:12,244
I see you had a few other boys
try to make it outta here.

282
00:19:12,274 --> 00:19:14,911
Si. Si, terrible pilots.

283
00:19:16,241 --> 00:19:21,175
Yeah, well...
I'm sure they were heavy.

284
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,776
You know, carryin' a lot of fuel
to make to States...

285
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:24,975
And merchandise and...

286
00:19:29,924 --> 00:19:32,546
Yeah, you know, this airport,
I mean it's...

287
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:35,027
High altitude
and a short runway.

288
00:19:35,227 --> 00:19:38,348
I mean, shit, you got trees
and mountains on both sides.

289
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:45,637
Is there uh,

290
00:19:45,837 --> 00:19:48,238
Is there somewhere else
I could take off from?

291
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:51,881
Not where the army wouldn't notice.

292
00:19:51,911 --> 00:19:53,052
Well, uh...

293
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:56,832
Can you make the runway longer?

294
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,445
They say
I should get rid of you.

295
00:20:11,346 --> 00:20:13,304
That you can't do it.

296
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:26,289
- We have our people in Miami.
- Yeah.

297
00:20:26,294 --> 00:20:30,458
You gonna land at the Okeechobee
Airport between 2:00 and 6:00 a.m.

298
00:20:30,498 --> 00:20:32,358
Look, there's uh...

299
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:36,300
There's been a change of plans
'cause I ain't landin' in Miami...

300
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,531
Oh, thank you. Gracias.

301
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:41,713
See, I ain't landin'
anywhere with this stuff.

302
00:20:41,718 --> 00:20:43,411
That's, that's how
ya'll got in trouble.

303
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:45,082
Now, look, just,
just hear me out.

304
00:20:45,282 --> 00:20:48,282
I know Louisiana.
Now, here's a map.

305
00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:52,344
Now, I'm gonna drop this stuff
right where "X" marks the spot.

306
00:20:52,394 --> 00:20:54,455
All right? Just...

307
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:58,523
What do you mean
you're not gonna land, huevon?

308
00:20:58,528 --> 00:21:02,495
Okay, just...
Hey, come here, just...

309
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:06,306
Look, just look at this.

310
00:21:07,777 --> 00:21:08,978
Look.

311
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:13,508
See, right here.
See that there?

312
00:21:13,613 --> 00:21:15,108
Hmm.

313
00:21:15,587 --> 00:21:17,208
Right there is your
million-dollar door.

314
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:34,063
All right?
You just go around.

315
00:21:34,068 --> 00:21:35,903
Each side... tight.

316
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:45,374
No, no, no.
No more.

317
00:21:46,213 --> 00:21:47,714
I said no more.

318
00:21:47,984 --> 00:21:50,475
No mas. No mas.
No mas. No mas.

319
00:21:50,495 --> 00:21:52,517
But there's plenty of room, gringo.

320
00:21:52,527 --> 00:21:56,367
- No, no. Si, si, Hasta arriba.
- Guys, guys.

321
00:21:56,467 --> 00:22:00,377
It ain't about room, all right?
It's about weight.

322
00:22:00,382 --> 00:22:03,769
Now, we agreed on 200,
I even put on 300.

323
00:22:06,209 --> 00:22:08,610
No mas.
No mas.

324
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,542
Keep pushin', come on.
I need all the runway I can get.

325
00:22:11,592 --> 00:22:15,121
Keep goin', keep goin'.
See that.

326
00:22:15,261 --> 00:22:20,955
Pare. Pare. Pare.

00:22:21,255 --> 00:22:22,456
Bien, bien.

328
00:22:23,057 --> 00:22:24,657
Gracias, gracias.

329
00:22:28,854 --> 00:22:30,582
Ho, whoa.

330
00:22:31,474 --> 00:22:33,421
Where the hell do you
think you're going, big fella?

331
00:22:33,445 --> 00:22:35,316
Come on. Out.

332
00:22:35,486 --> 00:22:37,586
He's gonna guard the product.

333
00:22:41,428 --> 00:22:42,789
This guy's fatter than fuck.

334
00:22:42,989 --> 00:22:46,186
I'm already 1500 pounds
overweight.

335
00:22:47,427 --> 00:22:52,369
Either I fly the big fella,
or I fly your product.

336
00:23:04,482 --> 00:23:06,352
Good luck, hermano.

337
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:08,353
God will keep you safe.

338
00:23:10,324 --> 00:23:12,456
He ain't gonna make this
runway any longer.

339
00:23:15,463 --> 00:23:18,493
Hey, Jorge.
Come here, give me it.

340
00:23:54,814 --> 00:23:56,413
Come on.

341
00:24:09,636 --> 00:24:11,437
Come on, come on, come on.

342
00:24:11,638 --> 00:24:13,329
Come on!

343
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:29,607
Oh!
Jesus!

344
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:44,913
Woo!

345
00:24:46,114 --> 00:24:47,312
Mwah!

346
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:42,026
I've got a possible target
headed due north.

347
00:25:42,031 --> 00:25:43,727
25 miles off shore.

348
00:26:00,527 --> 00:26:03,599
That's platform 14,
one of Shell's helicopters.

349
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:05,800
You need to disregard.

350
00:27:24,048 --> 00:27:27,150
John Ever Villa -
"Seguro Lo Hara Otro"

351
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:31,066
Coronamos de mi puta!

352
00:27:33,548 --> 00:27:36,619
- Señores, salud, Barry.
- Cheers, cheers.

353
00:27:36,629 --> 00:27:37,919
Esta loco este huevon.

354
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:39,200
Esta loco.

355
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,522
- Barry, esto es para ti.
- Wow!

356
00:27:43,392 --> 00:27:44,583
For you.

357
00:27:51,502 --> 00:27:53,492
Was that... uh, Wednesday?

358
00:27:53,532 --> 00:27:57,436
You want me to go-he wants me
to go again on Wednesday.

359
00:27:57,604 --> 00:27:59,875
- Yes, next Wednesday.
- What about the uh...

360
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,073
That runway?

361
00:28:03,774 --> 00:28:05,976
Pablo, Jorge!

362
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,257
Tranquilo, tranquilo

363
00:28:16,387 --> 00:28:18,086
Wait here, Barry.
Wait here.

364
00:28:18,386 --> 00:28:19,887
Tranquilo, tranquilo

365
00:28:20,797 --> 00:28:21,928
Are we running?

366
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,732
What...

367
00:28:27,971 --> 00:28:30,379
What is that?
You want me to wait here?

368
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,371
Pablo?

369
00:28:47,534 --> 00:28:48,593
Oh, my God.

370
00:29:01,777 --> 00:29:03,276
Si, si, si, si, si...

371
00:29:23,612 --> 00:29:24,743
Barry?

372
00:29:26,413 --> 00:29:28,282
Barry Seal?

373
00:29:28,342 --> 00:29:29,373
Schafer?

374
00:29:30,253 --> 00:29:32,443
- Barry Seal?
- Schafer?

375
00:29:33,383 --> 00:29:36,225
Oh, my God.
You look terrible.

376
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:38,355
So good to see you.

377
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,926
- You missing a tooth?
- Yeah.

378
00:29:39,931 --> 00:29:41,217
What the fuck?

379
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:42,998
- See these guys here?
- Yeah.

380
00:29:43,098 --> 00:29:46,367
I think they know that I am CIA.

381
00:29:47,508 --> 00:29:49,396
You're not CIA.

382
00:29:49,736 --> 00:29:52,137
You're a drug smuggler, Barry.

383
00:29:52,648 --> 00:29:56,720
Listen, Louisiana PD was
notified of your arrest here.

384
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,809
They're gonna raid your
house at 6:00 am.

385
00:29:58,819 --> 00:30:01,538
They're gonna pick up Lucy,
bring her in for questioning.

386
00:30:01,688 --> 00:30:03,750
Maybe even keep her overnight.

387
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,921
Oh, my God.

388
00:30:06,832 --> 00:30:09,803
Oh, my God. You gotta
get me out of here.

389
00:30:11,063 --> 00:30:12,673
Well, maybe...

390
00:30:13,474 --> 00:30:15,675
Maybe we could figure
something out.

391
00:30:16,603 --> 00:30:20,433
Okay. You can-you can
stop now, if you want, 'cause...

392
00:30:20,543 --> 00:30:21,834
Believe me...

393
00:30:22,584 --> 00:30:24,856
Shit gets crazy from here.

394
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:29,506
Remember them fellas that I
told you I was takin' snaps of?

395
00:30:29,511 --> 00:30:31,354
Turns out, they was
a bunch of commies.

396
00:30:31,555 --> 00:30:33,235
Called themselves Sandinistas.

397
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,587
These fellas managed to get their
shit together

398
00:30:35,592 --> 00:30:39,563
and take control right here in this
little country called Nicaragua.

399
00:30:39,568 --> 00:30:43,531
Oh, no, that's El Salvador.
Here you go, Nicaragua.

400
00:30:43,571 --> 00:30:47,570
This is the first successful
revolution in Central America.

401
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,440
Now, that may have been
bad news for some people.

402
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,541
But not for me. See,
there's a new sheriff in town.

403
00:30:53,581 --> 00:30:56,023
My fellow Americans,
I must speak to you tonight

404
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:58,523
about a mounting danger
in Central America.

405
00:30:58,527 --> 00:31:02,421
Even after everything that happened,
I-I still love Ronnie Reagan.

406
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:04,062
I mean, any man that can make it
from that monkey movie

407
00:31:04,067 --> 00:31:07,235
- all the way to the White House...
- What's the matter with him?

408
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,560
He's gotta know
what the hell he's doing.

409
00:31:08,565 --> 00:31:09,567
What he wanted

410
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:13,407
was to kick them commie
Sandinistas out of Nicaragua.

411
00:31:13,412 --> 00:31:15,438
And he wanted the Nicaraguan
freedom fighters

412
00:31:15,443 --> 00:31:17,642
called Contras to do it.

413
00:31:17,647 --> 00:31:19,516
They need to know that the U.S.
supports them

414
00:31:19,521 --> 00:31:22,446
with more than just
pretty words and good wishes.

415
00:31:22,487 --> 00:31:25,688
But Congress, well they smelled
the makings of another Vietnam.

416
00:31:25,693 --> 00:31:29,529
And they outright refused
to let Ronnie have his war.

417
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:33,428
But do you think them politicians
could tell the Gipper what to do?

418
00:31:33,668 --> 00:31:37,400
Hell, no.
He turned to the CIA.

419
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,602
And the CIA turned to me.

420
00:31:39,642 --> 00:31:43,444
Schafer, Schafer, that uh,
morning raid on my family...

421
00:31:43,454 --> 00:31:44,504
So, that's off now, right?

422
00:31:44,704 --> 00:31:47,572
No, no. That's uh,
that's still happening.

423
00:31:47,582 --> 00:31:49,481
- What?
- 6:00 am

424
00:31:49,521 --> 00:31:50,542
This fucking country!

425
00:31:50,552 --> 00:31:52,453
- Now, hold on.
- Stop!

426
00:31:52,553 --> 00:31:54,494
Now, we have a deal.

427
00:31:54,524 --> 00:31:55,555
I'm not a cop, Barry.

428
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,157
I can't make a search warrant
go away, you know?

429
00:31:58,167 --> 00:31:59,395
Things are in motion here.

430
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,494
Come on, man.
What that hell am I gonna do?

431
00:32:01,594 --> 00:32:04,395
I suggest you get your
family out of Louisiana.

432
00:32:04,405 --> 00:32:07,497
- Where am I supposed to take 'em?
- We got a place for you.

433
00:32:07,537 --> 00:32:09,406
Mena.

434
00:32:09,576 --> 00:32:11,477
Arkansas.

435
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:14,550
Arkansas?

436
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:17,909
Hey.

437
00:32:19,048 --> 00:32:21,189
Hey, Luce.

438
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,592
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

439
00:32:27,663 --> 00:32:30,262
My God, baby,
what happened to you?

440
00:32:30,267 --> 00:32:31,462
I'm okay.

441
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:33,701
Barry, you're missing a tooth.

442
00:32:33,706 --> 00:32:38,613
Hey, uh...
We're movin'.

443
00:32:38,673 --> 00:32:41,414
We gotta pack everything up.

444
00:32:41,514 --> 00:32:44,647
We gotta be outta here
before the sun comes up.

445
00:32:44,657 --> 00:32:50,595
We uh, so we get these
dresses and...

446
00:32:50,696 --> 00:32:52,597
You uh, do you need
all them shoes?

447
00:32:53,627 --> 00:32:55,527
Hey, there, sunshine.

448
00:32:56,498 --> 00:32:59,668
How you doin'? Now look,
I'm gonna give you a plastic bag.

449
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:03,202
I want you to go upstairs
and put your favorite toys...

450
00:33:03,207 --> 00:33:04,938
Go on back to bed, honey.
Daddy done lost his mind.

451
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:07,705
No, darlin', you listen to Daddy.
You go do that.

452
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,505
- See, we're going on an adventure.
- No, we're not going on an adventure.

453
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,231
Like the time we went
camping in the park?

454
00:33:11,236 --> 00:33:13,922
Not actually, but-'cause every
adventure's different.

455
00:33:13,927 --> 00:33:16,130
Oh, my God, you're actually
serious right now.

456
00:33:16,135 --> 00:33:18,792
Barry, it's 4:00 a.m.,
I'm not moving.

457
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:23,123
- Christina's school play is tomorrow!
- Do you trust me?

458
00:33:23,603 --> 00:33:24,774
No!

459
00:33:26,935 --> 00:33:29,270
But you love me.
You do love me.

460
00:33:32,573 --> 00:33:34,604
Of course, I fucking love you.

461
00:33:35,445 --> 00:33:37,306
Then listen, we gotta move.

462
00:33:37,586 --> 00:33:41,456
We gotta get outta here
before the sun comes up.

00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,711
Get in. Come on.

488
00:36:26,592 --> 00:36:28,553
Oh, shit.

489
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:32,624
We gotta make this quick.

490
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:36,534
She might leave me
before I get back.

491
00:36:44,607 --> 00:36:48,676
So, this is all yours.

492
00:36:48,681 --> 00:36:51,586
Including everything between
here and your house.

493
00:36:51,646 --> 00:36:53,647
Almost 2,000 acres.

494
00:36:53,757 --> 00:36:55,618
What do you think?

495
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,489
I own all this?

496
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:01,559
Oh, yeah.

497
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,642
This whole airport?

498
00:37:08,672 --> 00:37:10,731
Yeah. Congratulations.

499
00:37:36,606 --> 00:37:38,537
AK-47s.

500
00:37:38,542 --> 00:37:41,448
Soviet-made for the PLO.

501
00:37:41,508 --> 00:37:46,611
The Israelis captured these,
and then secretly traded them to us.

502
00:37:47,592 --> 00:37:50,560
And you're gonna
fly them to Nicaragua.

503
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,720
Uh, you didn't say
nothin' 'bout guns.

504
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,491
It's a war, Barry.

505
00:37:55,496 --> 00:37:58,662
Freedom fighters can't put up
much of a fight if they aren't armed.

506
00:37:58,732 --> 00:38:00,633
This was the deal.

507
00:38:00,673 --> 00:38:03,530
Or would you rather be
in a Colombian prison?

508
00:38:05,671 --> 00:38:10,615
This is every current law enforcement
investigation in the Gulf Coast.

509
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:14,516
FBI, ATF, DEA, Customs.

510
00:38:14,757 --> 00:38:17,518
These maps will help you
avoid all of 'em.

511
00:38:18,586 --> 00:38:20,756
Holy shit.

512
00:38:20,796 --> 00:38:24,596
You just fly where they ain't.

513
00:38:38,711 --> 00:38:41,481
Everything in this hangar's mine.

514
00:38:41,551 --> 00:38:42,551
Oh, yeah.

515
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:44,622
That truck's mine.

516
00:38:44,627 --> 00:38:45,648
Mm-hmm.

517
00:38:45,653 --> 00:38:48,494
- Tools are mine.
- Yes, sir.

518
00:38:48,561 --> 00:38:50,533
This airplane is mine.

519
00:38:52,662 --> 00:38:54,633
Bag is mine.

520
00:38:55,764 --> 00:38:57,605
What bag?

521
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:25,660
I fed the kids.
They're sleepin'.

522
00:39:27,511 --> 00:39:29,482
I unpacked the car.

523
00:39:29,572 --> 00:39:30,802
That is good.

524
00:39:31,511 --> 00:39:33,712
Fixed the sink.
Just the valve.

525
00:39:33,779 --> 00:39:36,751
See, I told you,
that was gonna be easy.

526
00:39:39,623 --> 00:39:40,683
Fuck, Barry!

527
00:39:40,723 --> 00:39:43,695
Okay, all right, all right.
Okay.

528
00:39:44,295 --> 00:39:46,497
Ima come clean.

529
00:39:48,198 --> 00:39:50,136
I don't work for TWA no more.

530
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:53,435
No shit, Barry.
Are you going to prison?

531
00:39:55,066 --> 00:39:56,266
No, ma'am.

532
00:39:59,578 --> 00:40:01,598
You gotta take care
of this family.

533
00:40:01,648 --> 00:40:02,778
'Cause I will take the kids.

534
00:40:02,783 --> 00:40:05,577
I will go right back to working
for Kentucky Fried Chicken.

535
00:40:05,677 --> 00:40:07,708
Luce, what I'm workin' on...

536
00:40:07,718 --> 00:40:10,490
- Barry, I'm six months pregnant.
- It's top secret.

537
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,679
I need a fridge.

538
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,631
I need beds for our children.

539
00:40:13,636 --> 00:40:16,622
I need a stove,
a fucking washing machine.

540
00:40:23,231 --> 00:40:25,292
Washing machine over there.

541
00:40:27,244 --> 00:40:29,175
Let me just...

542
00:40:37,415 --> 00:40:39,385
Is this all legal?

543
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:44,187
All right, what I'm about to tell you...
Now, you-you...

544
00:40:44,297 --> 00:40:48,390
You gotta swear you can't
ever tell anybody this, Lucy.

545
00:40:50,238 --> 00:40:51,259
All right?

546
00:40:53,408 --> 00:40:59,171
I am working...
for the CIA.

547
00:41:01,671 --> 00:41:02,671
Synced by Roy_Neary

548
00:42:05,863 --> 00:42:06,863
Hola!

549
00:42:08,764 --> 00:42:09,855
Howdy, amigos.

550
00:42:09,925 --> 00:42:12,795
I'm here on behalf of Uncle Sam.

551
00:42:23,946 --> 00:42:26,709
Look, Schafer.
I ain't no military expert,

552
00:42:26,779 --> 00:42:28,840
but are you sure
these are the right guys?

553
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:31,552
'Cause they seem a damn sight
more interested in my boots

554
00:42:31,557 --> 00:42:32,751
than in your guns.

555
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:34,778
Look, this is getting big time.

556
00:42:34,828 --> 00:42:36,789
Schafer, I just don't think
I'm the guy for this.

557
00:42:36,794 --> 00:42:38,960
You just keep delivering
that pizza, you hear me?

558
00:42:38,965 --> 00:42:40,461
You just keep delivering.

559
00:42:52,114 --> 00:42:55,304
Hola. All right.

560
00:42:55,954 --> 00:42:57,945
These are gifts.

561
00:42:59,757 --> 00:43:00,777
All right?

562
00:43:00,987 --> 00:43:05,955
All right? Gifts.
Regalos de mi.

563
00:43:07,026 --> 00:43:09,898
Back off. Off.

564
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:13,809
Regalos.

565
00:43:14,114 --> 00:43:15,250
Amigos.

566
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:16,851
Atras, atras.

567
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:24,769
Now, these guns
are gifts from Uncle Sam.

568
00:43:32,973 --> 00:43:34,524
I'm not fuckin' around.

569
00:43:35,562 --> 00:43:37,958
Barry! Put the bat down, huevon!

570
00:43:37,963 --> 00:43:39,904
We're all friends here.

571
00:43:39,974 --> 00:43:43,875
Jorge.
What the hell are you doing here?

572
00:43:43,945 --> 00:43:45,846
This is Don Adolfo Calero.

573
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:48,617
He works for your
government on the revolution

574
00:43:48,622 --> 00:43:49,822
to bring down the Sandinistas.

575
00:43:49,848 --> 00:43:52,577
Jorge tells me you are
the crazy gringo

576
00:43:52,582 --> 00:43:53,975
who always delivers.

577
00:43:55,026 --> 00:43:57,858
We have a new business
proposition to you, Barry.

578
00:43:57,888 --> 00:44:00,801
You bring your American
guns to Colombia,

579
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:03,960
deliver our cocaine here
to the Contras,

580
00:44:04,801 --> 00:44:07,859
the Contras take it by
fishing boats to Miami,

581
00:44:07,969 --> 00:44:09,840
and everybody's happy.

582
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:14,442
It's for the war effort, Mr. Seal.

583
00:44:14,642 --> 00:44:16,643
Lucho Castellanos y su Grupo -
"Bombo y Maracas"

584
00:44:16,753 --> 00:44:18,930
Turns out the Contras didn't really
want to fight a war.

585
00:44:18,954 --> 00:44:21,943
They just want to make money.
Like the rest of us.

586
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:25,953
Meanwhile, the Medellin Cartel
wanted guns.

587
00:44:25,993 --> 00:44:28,965
So they worked out
a little trade.

588
00:44:29,105 --> 00:44:30,165
What was I gonna tell 'em?

589
00:44:30,195 --> 00:44:32,934
I'm just a gringo
who always delivers.

590
00:44:33,766 --> 00:44:35,734
Here's how the operation worked.

591
00:44:35,804 --> 00:44:37,765
I'd load up the guns at Mena.

592
00:44:37,805 --> 00:44:41,838
Then, using Schafer's intel,
I'd bypass any law enforcement

593
00:44:41,878 --> 00:44:45,539
and fly straight to the
Cartel's airstrip in Medellin.

594
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:50,362
Colombians, well,
they love them guns.

595
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:53,393
Then I'd load up with fresh powder

596
00:44:53,398 --> 00:44:56,499
and fly on to the
Contra training camp.

597
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:01,492
The Contras hid the coke in
fishing boats and sailed it up to Miami.

598
00:45:02,443 --> 00:45:04,432
Meanwhile, I'd get
another load of powder,

599
00:45:04,472 --> 00:45:07,602
take it back to the States
with a quick stop to refuel in Panama,

600
00:45:07,612 --> 00:45:11,444
under the protection of
my old friend, Colonel Noriega.

601
00:45:11,484 --> 00:45:13,644
Congratulations on your
promotion, General.

602
00:45:13,654 --> 00:45:16,515
Of course, he'd get his cut too.

603
00:45:17,456 --> 00:45:19,657
On the way back,
I'd keep an eye out for the DEA.

604
00:45:20,397 --> 00:45:22,556
Then I'd dump it all
in the swamps in Louisiana.

605
00:45:27,437 --> 00:45:31,429
The operation got so big,
I had to get some help.

606
00:45:31,509 --> 00:45:34,569
Pete Dubois, manufactured guns
until he discovered

607
00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:36,507
he had a knack for selling pot.

608
00:45:36,607 --> 00:45:40,379
Stan Mason flew dope from
Mexico to Arizona.

609
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,510
Bill Cooper,

610
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:45,391
he flew opium all around
Southeast Asia during Vietnam.

611
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:48,393
Then there's Bob.

612
00:45:48,423 --> 00:45:51,552
Uh, I don't know much about Bob.
Hell of a pilot, though.

613
00:45:52,502 --> 00:45:55,562
I call these boys my Snowbirds.

614
00:45:55,602 --> 00:45:57,593
And we could fly through anything.

615
00:46:21,629 --> 00:46:23,360
Schafer.

616
00:46:23,598 --> 00:46:24,658
Barry.

617
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,499
How's it going?

618
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:29,400
Hey Boss!

619
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:33,412
That was fucking crazy, man!

620
00:46:35,452 --> 00:46:38,581
How's it uh,
how's it going down there?

621
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:40,512
Oh, you know...

622
00:46:41,422 --> 00:46:42,444
Busy.

623
00:46:44,694 --> 00:46:46,425
You?

624
00:46:47,436 --> 00:46:48,496
Oh, yeah.

625
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:51,464
Busy.

626
00:47:00,547 --> 00:47:02,419
Where are they going?

627
00:47:03,449 --> 00:47:05,508
We need to borrow some
of your land.

628
00:47:07,557 --> 00:47:11,519
They want you to
fly 'em up here to-to train.

629
00:47:11,524 --> 00:47:13,454
For training.

630
00:47:13,459 --> 00:47:14,620
Who?

631
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,591
The Contras.

632
00:47:21,441 --> 00:47:23,532
You want me to
bring 'em up here?

633
00:47:23,537 --> 00:47:24,706
To me?

634
00:47:24,711 --> 00:47:27,612
We're setting up a
field and operational training ground.

635
00:47:33,686 --> 00:47:35,585
Where? On...

636
00:47:35,655 --> 00:47:37,622
- My land?
- Yeah.

637
00:47:38,493 --> 00:47:39,654
Starting immediately.

638
00:47:39,694 --> 00:47:41,455
Which is great.

639
00:47:42,695 --> 00:47:44,525
Is that a problem?

640
00:47:44,535 --> 00:47:46,598
Uh... hey.

641
00:47:47,508 --> 00:47:49,499
Whatever you need, boss.

642
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,212
Que?

643
00:48:01,412 --> 00:48:02,713
Necesito un baño.

644
00:48:04,912 --> 00:48:08,211
Uh... no baño.

645
00:48:27,615 --> 00:48:30,677
Hang on! We're supposed to have 15.
I'm only counting 12 here.

646
00:48:30,687 --> 00:48:33,658
Them Contras were damn excited
about being in the US of A.

647
00:48:34,557 --> 00:48:37,526
They were runnin' away almost
faster than we could bring 'em in.

648
00:48:41,698 --> 00:48:45,508
Hey, you two! Where do you
think you're going?

649
00:48:45,513 --> 00:48:47,600
What, you want to quadruple
the shipments?

650
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,511
We're counting on the Contras
to win by summer if we...

651
00:48:50,516 --> 00:48:51,629
if we give 'em what they need.

652
00:48:51,653 --> 00:48:53,411
That's great.

653
00:48:53,451 --> 00:48:55,510
How much more can you get
out of your guy in Mena?

654
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:57,421
We'll get everything out of him.

655
00:48:57,491 --> 00:48:58,571
That's what I like to hear.

656
00:48:59,563 --> 00:49:02,534
We're expanding operations, Barry.

657
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:06,595
Come on. One at a time.
One at a time! Hey, hold on.

658
00:49:06,635 --> 00:49:08,662
No, no, no.

659
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:10,573
We'll take care of everybody,
just calma.

660
00:49:11,804 --> 00:49:13,045
Back!

661
00:49:14,544 --> 00:49:15,705
Back!

662
00:49:15,905 --> 00:49:18,307
Calma, calma.

663
00:49:18,447 --> 00:49:20,578
Everyone just calm the fuck down!

664
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:41,600
Salud.

665
00:49:45,742 --> 00:49:48,443
- Hey, Barry.
- Yeah.

666
00:49:48,483 --> 00:49:50,455
Do you think those
Contras can win?

667
00:49:51,725 --> 00:49:52,725
No.

668
00:49:58,564 --> 00:49:59,495
Hi.

669
00:49:59,535 --> 00:50:02,627
This just came.
"Go Razorbacks, Barry."

670
00:50:02,707 --> 00:50:06,437
Season tickets.
50-yard line.

671
00:50:07,475 --> 00:50:09,536
Well, that was awful nice of him.

672
00:50:09,576 --> 00:50:12,548
How much property has Seal
bought us since he came to town?

673
00:50:13,478 --> 00:50:15,578
I don't know, 500 acres?

674
00:50:15,618 --> 00:50:18,679
2,000 acres.
From the airport to Ouachita.

675
00:50:18,689 --> 00:50:21,451
What's he want with all that
worthless land?

676
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:24,550
It's really none of our business.
Really.

677
00:50:27,499 --> 00:50:29,692
He's good people, Judy.

678
00:50:29,702 --> 00:50:33,434
And he's doing a lot
for the community.

679
00:50:38,607 --> 00:50:40,638
I'd like to open a bank account.

680
00:50:41,749 --> 00:50:42,809
Oh, bless you!

681
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:45,581
I'll be right back.

682
00:50:45,651 --> 00:50:46,712
David!

683
00:50:46,792 --> 00:50:48,623
Come on, Christina!

684
00:50:53,766 --> 00:50:54,796
Good job, guys.

685
00:50:55,577 --> 00:50:56,998
Woo!

686
00:50:57,878 --> 00:51:00,611
- Great, Christina!
- Go, go, go, go!

687
00:51:00,616 --> 00:51:01,858
Oranges. You guys
want some oranges?

688
00:51:01,882 --> 00:51:04,582
Hey guys, I got pizza!

689
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:05,854
You guys want some pizza?

690
00:51:06,184 --> 00:51:09,626
Yeah! All right.
Let me just put this right...

691
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:15,860
There you go.

692
00:51:22,684 --> 00:51:24,410
- Nice wheels!
- Oh, you like her?

693
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:25,685
I do.

694
00:51:25,686 --> 00:51:26,846
1982.

695
00:51:26,856 --> 00:51:28,727
All the bells and whistles.

696
00:51:28,757 --> 00:51:31,859
First one in the State of Arkansas,
and she's yours.

697
00:51:32,401 --> 00:51:34,002
She's mine?

698
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,703
She's yours.

699
00:51:35,733 --> 00:51:37,764
Oh, my God, Barry!

700
00:51:37,804 --> 00:51:39,835
Thank you!

701
00:51:41,876 --> 00:51:44,648
- Wow.
- A little somethin' extra in there.

702
00:51:45,688 --> 00:51:47,349
Fuck me, Barry!

703
00:51:50,831 --> 00:51:51,892
What?

704
00:51:53,863 --> 00:51:55,694
Okay, you need to behave.

705
00:51:56,695 --> 00:51:58,896
Louis Clark -
Hooked on Classics (Parts 1 & 2)

706
00:51:58,906 --> 00:52:00,677
I brought some snacks up
for you, Christina.

707
00:52:00,682 --> 00:52:01,838
By the summer of '82,

708
00:52:03,819 --> 00:52:06,652
business was booming.

709
00:52:09,764 --> 00:52:12,695
Got us at Tuesday at 3:00.
Tuesday at 3:00.

710
00:52:12,765 --> 00:52:14,526
We need to increase
the shipments.

711
00:52:14,667 --> 00:52:15,827
Can you add a Friday delivery?

712
00:52:15,837 --> 00:52:19,599
Friday? Okay. Hold on, now.
Yeah?

713
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:21,701
We want to double the
amount of guns we're bringing in.

714
00:52:21,711 --> 00:52:23,652
- Double?
- Next pass by Friday.

715
00:52:23,657 --> 00:52:25,713
Oh, hold on, does that-
does that have to be Friday?

716
00:52:28,755 --> 00:52:30,786
I opened a few
front corporations.

717
00:52:30,796 --> 00:52:33,468
I can't wait to learn
everything there is to know

718
00:52:33,473 --> 00:52:35,669
about the sign business, Mr. Seal.

719
00:52:35,729 --> 00:52:36,669
Me too.

720
00:52:36,701 --> 00:52:39,702
I spent 30 years workin' the pumps
at Gas 'n Sip.

721
00:52:39,712 --> 00:52:42,644
Well, Sir, I think it's about time
you moved to upper management.

722
00:52:42,674 --> 00:52:44,994
But the money was comin' in
faster than I could launder it.

723
00:52:56,971 --> 00:52:58,902
I was takin' pictures.

724
00:52:59,032 --> 00:53:00,673
Delivering guns.

725
00:53:01,043 --> 00:53:03,215
Droppin' off and pickin' up.

726
00:53:03,845 --> 00:53:06,386
Damn, I was buildin' an air force.

727
00:53:08,348 --> 00:53:09,518
New toy, boys.

728
00:53:14,392 --> 00:53:17,334
- I wanted a scary book.
- You did?

729
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:20,405
What are you doing Barry!

730
00:53:20,576 --> 00:53:22,437
Smile, Barry.

731
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,540
Jorge!

732
00:53:28,741 --> 00:53:29,741
Hermano.

733
00:53:31,452 --> 00:53:32,513
Lobsters!

734
00:53:32,553 --> 00:53:34,324
Aw, you remember.

735
00:53:34,364 --> 00:53:35,415
What, do you think I'd forget?

736
00:53:35,425 --> 00:53:37,326
Your husband is a genius.

737
00:53:37,366 --> 00:53:40,427
When it absolutely, positively
has to be delivered overnight...

738
00:53:41,368 --> 00:53:42,368
My wife, Lucy.

739
00:53:43,409 --> 00:53:45,381
No, no, no.

740
00:54:24,606 --> 00:54:29,508
I had my fingers in every pie
on the rack.

741
00:54:29,518 --> 00:54:31,550
$10 million in Mena National.

742
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,521
$12 million in Mena State.

743
00:54:33,551 --> 00:54:35,752
15 at Mena Trust.

744
00:54:35,792 --> 00:54:37,793
I had 40 parked in Miami.

745
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:40,735
20 in Panama,
$7 million in lawn bags.

746
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:43,997
8 in Samsonites, 4 buried in
the woods behind my house.

747
00:54:44,007 --> 00:54:46,378
90 pounds of gold in my closet.

748
00:54:46,684 --> 00:54:48,606
Hot damn!

749
00:54:48,611 --> 00:54:50,582
Honey, watch the yoke.

750
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:54,454
If this ain't the greatest
country in the world.

751
00:55:07,142 --> 00:55:08,342
Uh...

752
00:55:08,743 --> 00:55:10,273
JB.

753
00:55:14,676 --> 00:55:15,977
Uh...

754
00:55:18,598 --> 00:55:19,629
Yeah.

755
00:55:20,229 --> 00:55:22,171
- Hey, Sis!
- JB!

756
00:55:22,201 --> 00:55:24,193
What the fuck!

757
00:55:24,243 --> 00:55:26,034
Look at you!

758
00:55:26,074 --> 00:55:28,015
- Look at you!
- God damn!

759
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,035
Get in here.

760
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:30,246
Look at this fuckin' house.

761
00:55:30,656 --> 00:55:33,008
Parkin' Chevys a lot harder
than it fuckin' looks, dude.

762
00:55:33,018 --> 00:55:34,719
Hey, watch your mouth
around the kids.

763
00:55:34,724 --> 00:55:35,920
Sorry.

764
00:55:37,761 --> 00:55:39,131
Is that right?

765
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:40,922
Yeah, man.

766
00:55:40,927 --> 00:55:41,998
They had me uh...

767
00:55:42,003 --> 00:55:45,535
crammin' those S-10s into every
goddamn inch of the parkin' lot.

768
00:55:45,605 --> 00:55:47,436
Hey, you heard me.

769
00:55:47,476 --> 00:55:48,497
I'm sorry!

770
00:55:48,507 --> 00:55:49,509
But the thing is,

771
00:55:49,709 --> 00:55:52,374
is that, the cars were
so close to each other, right?

772
00:55:52,379 --> 00:55:54,612
- You couldn't help but scratch, right?
- Hmm.

773
00:55:54,622 --> 00:55:55,752
And then, they would take
the scratches out of

774
00:55:55,757 --> 00:55:57,453
my fucking paycheck, man.

775
00:55:57,463 --> 00:55:59,364
- Hey! JB.
- Sorry.

776
00:55:59,464 --> 00:56:01,626
Well, I don't know how
you handled the pressure, JB.

777
00:56:01,666 --> 00:56:03,597
You stayin' here,
you gettin' a job.

778
00:56:03,607 --> 00:56:05,108
Or you know, I could just
give you some folded cash,

779
00:56:05,113 --> 00:56:06,604
you go and do what you want.

780
00:56:06,609 --> 00:56:08,540
- Don't you look at him like that.
- What?

781
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:11,572
You are gettin' a job, JB,
not a handout.

782
00:56:11,812 --> 00:56:13,643
My brother's gettin' a job, Barry.

783
00:56:13,783 --> 00:56:16,544
You're gettin' a job.
Definitely.

784
00:56:16,655 --> 00:56:19,556
You hear that? Thats the law.

785
00:56:20,097 --> 00:56:21,587
You gonna have to work, son.

786
00:56:21,627 --> 00:56:23,599
- You gonna have to work.
- That's right.

787
00:56:23,629 --> 00:56:26,501
Hey, what-what is it
I'll be doin' exactly?

788
00:56:26,701 --> 00:56:30,103
The Troyes -
"I Don't Need You"

789
00:56:30,344 --> 00:56:32,145
Yo, Barry!

790
00:56:33,285 --> 00:56:35,086
Barry!

791
00:56:35,256 --> 00:56:36,317
Barry!

792
00:56:36,657 --> 00:56:37,888
What now, JB?

793
00:56:37,898 --> 00:56:40,309
Say, this is a big hangar.
And I'm tired of sweeping.

794
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,951
You can take a break
when you get it done.

795
00:56:42,956 --> 00:56:44,152
Let's go. Get it done.

796
00:56:44,182 --> 00:56:46,173
Hey man, I got a new job for ya.

797
00:56:46,223 --> 00:56:47,314
Give me a beer, man.

798
00:56:48,024 --> 00:56:49,215
Dead soldier.

799
00:56:49,315 --> 00:56:50,515
Eh, fuck this.

800
00:57:15,551 --> 00:57:16,752
Barry?

801
00:57:16,757 --> 00:57:17,853
Yeah?

802
00:57:17,863 --> 00:57:19,954
Roscoe dug this up
in the backyard.

803
00:57:20,024 --> 00:57:22,866
There are bills
blowin' around everywhere.

804
00:57:22,871 --> 00:57:24,727
I'll rake it up in the mornin'.

805
00:57:24,837 --> 00:57:27,768
I found three more of 'em
up in the fireplace.

806
00:57:28,269 --> 00:57:31,171
Tomborato -
"Negra Rosa"

807
00:57:31,472 --> 00:57:33,156
Coro-namos

808
00:57:33,273 --> 00:57:34,373
Coronamos.

809
00:57:36,575 --> 00:57:39,676
♪ Ay, Se me fue la Negra Rosa ♪

810
00:57:40,677 --> 00:57:43,483
♪ Ay, Se me fue la Negra ♪

812
00:58:01,459 --> 00:58:02,731
Shit.

813
00:58:14,018 --> 00:58:16,209
We had cash floodin' in
from every direction.

814
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:21,992
Who-who thought that was
gonna be a problem? I mean...

815
00:58:22,122 --> 00:58:24,224
We were runnin' out of
places to put it.

816
00:58:28,466 --> 00:58:30,237
Easy. Whoa.

817
00:58:30,708 --> 00:58:32,969
Don't get behind him.
These are dangerous animals.

818
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,471
You know, maybe we should
call the trainer.

819
00:58:34,476 --> 00:58:35,671
No, honey, I got this.

820

Come on.
Hang on.

JB got a new car.

823
00:58:51,871 --> 00:58:53,872
Did you give that boy a raise?

824
00:58:53,942 --> 00:58:55,103
Hey, Barry, Luce.

825
00:58:58,115 --> 00:59:01,987
What in the holy fuck?
That girl is 15.

826
00:59:04,128 --> 00:59:06,029
- It's huge
- I told you it's huge.

827
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:07,971
- You actually live here?
- Uh-huh.

828
00:59:08,032 --> 00:59:11,003
Hey. Can you talk to
you for a second?

829
00:59:11,103 --> 00:59:12,164
Yeah.

830
00:59:13,104 --> 00:59:14,906
- What?
- Come here

831
00:59:14,916 --> 00:59:16,907
- What the hell, JB?
- What?

832
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:18,978
- I hadn't done nothin' yet.
- JB.

833
00:59:19,048 --> 00:59:20,125
- JB. Come on.
- Hi, Mrs. Seal.

834
00:59:20,149 --> 00:59:23,060
What-we was just
gonna go for a swim.

835
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,191
Come here.

836
00:59:24,992 --> 00:59:26,993
- Please don't tell my mama I was here.
- Come on.

837
00:59:27,003 --> 00:59:29,164
Where'd you get the
money for this car?

838
00:59:36,108 --> 00:59:39,881
Ima be honest with you, Barry.
'Cause I can't lie to you.

839
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,153
I stole it from the hangar.

840
00:59:46,637 --> 00:59:47,776
What?

841
00:59:48,066 --> 00:59:49,607
I opened up
one of the Samsonites.

842
00:59:49,807 --> 00:59:52,008
I found so much
fuckin' money in there.

843
00:59:52,038 --> 00:59:53,980
- So much goddamn money.
- JB, JB, JB...

844
00:59:53,985 --> 00:59:55,941
JB, you can't do that

845
00:59:56,611 --> 00:59:57,972
You can't do that.

846
01:00:00,213 --> 01:00:03,125
500 down to 300.
Watch out for that tree at the end.

847
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:04,186
Yeah, I remember that.

848
01:00:09,369 --> 01:00:12,301
No, Pete, you gotta turn that off.
I can't see nothin' with that on.

849
01:00:12,306 --> 01:00:13,442
Gotcha.

850
01:00:13,812 --> 01:00:16,144
75. 50.

851
01:00:19,386 --> 01:00:21,357
Nicely done, boss.

852
01:00:41,188 --> 01:00:42,309
You boys see this?

853
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,334
Ho!
God!

854
01:00:50,235 --> 01:00:53,206
This is the United States
Drug Enforcement Administration.

855
01:00:53,211 --> 01:00:56,268
You are in violation of the
air defense identification zone.

856
01:00:56,408 --> 01:00:59,240
We are ordering you
to land immediately.

857
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,251
Follow us to New Orleans NAS.

858
01:01:01,556 --> 01:01:03,753
All right, boys.
Gonna be a long night.

859
01:01:04,553 --> 01:01:07,525
Come back to the sea, 105 knots.
And flaps down.

860
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:09,726
I repeat, we are ordering
you to land immediately.

861
01:01:09,731 --> 01:01:12,363
The DEA was using these
fancy new jets

862
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:13,668
that we couldn't outrun.

863
01:01:13,698 --> 01:01:15,641
Follow to New Orleans NAS.

864
01:01:15,646 --> 01:01:17,702
But all that speed
comes at a heavy price.

865
01:01:17,712 --> 01:01:18,712
I repeat...

866
01:01:18,742 --> 01:01:20,673
They could go fast.

867
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:23,275
But we could go slow.

868
01:01:23,355 --> 01:01:26,127
For a long time

869
01:01:42,247 --> 01:01:44,048
Low fuel.

870
01:01:44,088 --> 01:01:46,319
We gotta turn around, guys.
We're bingo.

871
01:01:46,359 --> 01:01:49,262
Those pricks are
right fucking there.

872
01:01:53,164 --> 01:01:54,335
All right, boys.

873
01:01:55,135 --> 01:01:58,107
DEA finally ran out of gas.
Time to head home.

874
01:02:08,323 --> 01:02:10,354
Bill! What the fuck, man?

875
01:02:11,135 --> 01:02:13,096
Where you headed, buddy?
Come on.

876
01:02:14,136 --> 01:02:16,128
All right, I'll get him.
I'll get him.

877
01:02:18,339 --> 01:02:22,282
Bill! Come on, turn around.
Come on, let's go.

878
01:02:23,213 --> 01:02:25,344
Bill? You hearin' me?

879
01:02:28,396 --> 01:02:31,087
Oh, son of a bitch!

880
01:02:31,198 --> 01:02:32,358
Bill's asleep.

881
01:02:33,399 --> 01:02:35,200
God damn!

882
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:37,261
Bill, wa-wake up, man!

883
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:39,142
That motherfucker can sleep anywhere.

884
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,233
Wake up, Bill.

885
01:02:42,244 --> 01:02:43,244
Bill!

886
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:48,218
- Good morning, Bill!
- Okay, I'm up.

887
01:02:50,359 --> 01:02:52,131
Welcome back.

888
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:55,363
Those bank financials
that you asked for.

889
01:02:56,263 --> 01:02:57,674
Yeah.

890
01:03:01,416 --> 01:03:04,178
There's a lot of money
in Mena, Arkansas.

891
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:07,380
Thanks.

892
01:03:09,191 --> 01:03:12,253
I think you're gonna appreciate
what we've done here, Barry.

893
01:03:18,306 --> 01:03:19,437
Making me my own vault?

894
01:03:20,177 --> 01:03:24,311
Oh, no, no. We're using this auxiliary
for all our other customers.

895
01:03:27,353 --> 01:03:30,224
We gave you the main vault.

896
01:03:33,326 --> 01:03:34,387
How 'bout that.

897
01:04:18,404 --> 01:04:21,235
Aerostar
two one niner three Golf.

898
01:04:21,275 --> 01:04:23,407
Head to New Orleans
Naval Air Station at once.

899
01:04:26,318 --> 01:04:28,179
Yeah, come on, come on, come on!

900
01:04:28,219 --> 01:04:29,351
You better run, you prick.

901
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:45,371
This is the United States
Border Patrol.

902
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:46,381
Shit.

903
01:04:46,411 --> 01:04:48,382
We are ordering you to land.

904
01:04:48,482 --> 01:04:50,253
Hey, boys.

905
01:04:51,424 --> 01:04:54,396
I see you finally got smart
and got a slower plane.

906
01:04:59,669 --> 01:05:01,071
Two of 'em.

907
01:05:01,271 --> 01:05:02,432
That's right, son.

908
01:05:02,472 --> 01:05:05,243
We're up here as long as you want.

909
01:05:06,344 --> 01:05:09,376
Aerostar, we are ordering you
to land immediately.

910
01:05:10,316 --> 01:05:12,418
All right, motherfuckers.
Let's land.

911
01:05:13,258 --> 01:05:15,459
I repeat, we are ordering
you to land imm...

912
01:05:19,372 --> 01:05:20,432
What the fuck?

913
01:05:22,634 --> 01:05:24,325
Stay on him.

914
01:05:57,855 --> 01:05:59,046
Shit.

915
01:06:01,047 --> 01:06:02,298
Oh, shit!

916
01:06:35,538 --> 01:06:37,371
Is this your yard?

917
01:06:42,313 --> 01:06:44,405
That's for the damage.
And uh...

918
01:06:44,515 --> 01:06:46,486
Here's a little somethin' extra
for your sister.

919
01:06:46,491 --> 01:06:47,557
Hey, little darlin'.

920
01:06:47,562 --> 01:06:48,647
And your bike.

921
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:55,431
You never saw me.

922
01:07:06,488 --> 01:07:11,392
A plane crashed in Louisiana with
200 kilos of Colombian powder.

923
01:07:11,432 --> 01:07:12,522
200.

924
01:07:12,527 --> 01:07:14,523
- Right.
- Is that your boy?

925
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:18,466
I'm sorry, are you working
for the fucking DEA now?

926
01:07:19,406 --> 01:07:20,567
Interesting read.

927
01:07:28,021 --> 01:07:29,342
I got it.

928
01:07:32,524 --> 01:07:34,365
- Hello, amigo.
- Si.

929
01:07:34,435 --> 01:07:36,542
I had to get out of Colombia
in the middle of the night.

930
01:07:36,566 --> 01:07:39,508
I wasn't the only one
having trouble with the DEA.

931
01:07:39,538 --> 01:07:42,481
Escobar's gone crazy and
declared war on the government.

932
01:07:42,486 --> 01:07:46,353
Thanks to Pablo Escobar's
unique management style...

933
01:07:46,513 --> 01:07:49,385
the cartel found themselves
kicked out of Colombia.

934
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:00,442
The only place the
DEA couldn't touch him?

935
01:08:00,542 --> 01:08:02,443
That's right. Nicaragua.

936
01:08:02,643 --> 01:08:04,944
- Is everything okay here?
- Yes, we're late.

937
01:08:05,484 --> 01:08:07,476
We're going to meet Sr. Vaughan.

938
01:08:07,556 --> 01:08:09,487
He's the Minister of Interiors.

939
01:08:09,517 --> 01:08:11,358
Controls the airstrips.

940
01:08:11,488 --> 01:08:13,359
It's how we get you in.

941
01:08:21,575 --> 01:08:26,348
Barry, sit and shut your mouth.

I'll take care of that.

971
01:10:30,515 --> 01:10:32,486
- All right?
- All right, hurry up, Barry.

972
01:10:32,516 --> 01:10:34,387
You just sit tight.
I love you.

973
01:10:37,489 --> 01:10:38,590
How much? Cuanto?

974
01:10:42,672 --> 01:10:44,573
"Mil quin..." that's 15 uh...

975
01:10:44,578 --> 01:10:46,434
1500 kilos, Barry.

976
01:10:46,474 --> 01:10:47,474
1500?

977
01:10:47,505 --> 01:10:49,416
Si. In one go.

978
01:10:50,517 --> 01:10:51,517
In one go?

979
01:10:51,812 --> 01:10:53,949
Si.

980
01:10:53,959 --> 01:10:56,481
Well, we ain't never
done that before.

981
01:10:56,891 --> 01:10:58,693
Sanctuary isn't cheap.

982
01:10:58,733 --> 01:11:00,564
That's a lot

983
01:11:00,594 --> 01:11:01,694
Can you do it?

984
01:11:02,705 --> 01:11:05,637
Yeah, I'm gonna get home...

985
01:11:05,677 --> 01:11:08,668
Right now. I'm gonna leave.
Then uh, we'll figure it out.

986
01:11:08,708 --> 01:11:10,479
I'll figure it out.

987
01:11:16,693 --> 01:11:19,455
Get it fucking done.

988
01:11:22,567 --> 01:11:24,598
Fucking lawyer
doesn't know shit.

989
01:11:24,638 --> 01:11:27,631
I got two fucking priors, man.
And he doesn't understand.

990
01:11:27,641 --> 01:11:29,672
No, no, no.
He does understand.

991
01:11:30,442 --> 01:11:31,843
And you gotta do
what he tells you to do.

992
01:11:31,848 --> 01:11:33,344
No, he doesn't, man.

993
01:11:33,649 --> 01:11:36,546
One more strike, man. One more
strike and I can go to prison...

994
01:11:36,586 --> 01:11:37,717
- for-for life, man.
- JB.

995
01:11:37,757 --> 01:11:39,658
JB, just...
hold on.

996
01:11:42,499 --> 01:11:44,731
Barry?
Barry, are you there?

997
01:11:45,471 --> 01:11:46,632
Daddy!

998
01:11:46,672 --> 01:11:47,732
Hey, darlin'.

999
01:11:48,673 --> 01:11:50,574
What's that?
Hold on.

1000
01:11:50,614 --> 01:11:51,705
- Yeah?
- Barry.

1001
01:11:51,745 --> 01:11:53,886
We've been trying
to get a hold of you, amigo.

1002
01:11:53,891 --> 01:11:56,731
Yeah, I know that, amigo. Listen,
could you hold on, I'll be right back.

1003
01:12:03,563 --> 01:12:04,633
- JB?
- Yeah.

1004
01:12:04,673 --> 01:12:06,735
There's some people
that wanna talk to me.

1005
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:11,507
No, no no. You don't talk to
anyone about anything.

1006
01:12:11,547 --> 01:12:13,038
Now, you do what that
lawyer tells you to.

1007
01:12:13,043 --> 01:12:14,539
And you keep your
fucking mouth shut.

1008
01:12:14,549 --> 01:12:16,751
- I'm taking care of this.
- Okay.

1009
01:12:19,592 --> 01:12:22,684
Listen, Jorge, we gotta put on
the brakes for a bit.

1010
01:12:22,784 --> 01:12:25,386
Brakes? No, no, no.
No brakes.

1011
01:12:25,391 --> 01:12:26,486
We have product to move.

1012
01:12:26,491 --> 01:12:28,668
I understand amigo,
but I-I got a family situation.

1013
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:31,669
Eh, your brother-in-law.
We know all about it.

1014
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:34,552
- We'll handle it, amigo.
- No, no, no, no.

1015
01:12:34,557 --> 01:12:37,754
- I don't want you to handle it.
- Barry, listen.

1016
01:12:37,784 --> 01:12:40,626
- I got it. I got this.
- Barry, listen to me.

1017
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:44,598
We'll handle it, okay?
So don't worry.

1018
01:12:44,603 --> 01:12:46,699
- We'll talk business later.
- Jorge...

1019
01:13:15,747 --> 01:13:18,719
Barry, they don-they don't know
about them suitcases you got.

1020
01:13:18,759 --> 01:13:20,436
Or what you got in them planes,
the guns you got.

1021
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:22,561
They don't know anything about it.

1022
01:13:22,566 --> 01:13:23,692
We're good, man.

1023
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:26,564
I can't fix this.
You hear?

1024
01:13:26,764 --> 01:13:31,607
They're gonna give you 10-
10 years for not talkin'.

1025
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:33,738
That's 10 years people
gotta worry you will.

1026
01:13:33,778 --> 01:13:35,629
I didn't say anything, man.

1027
01:13:35,829 --> 01:13:37,651
You can talk to the goddamn lawyer.

1028
01:13:41,564 --> 01:13:42,754
Where we going, man?

1029
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:50,639
You serious?
I'm fucking family.

1030
01:13:54,611 --> 01:13:55,772
We're family!

1031
01:13:58,784 --> 01:14:02,696
That's right. Right.
We're a family.

1032
01:14:04,697 --> 01:14:07,689
- What's that?
- Inside's a passport...

1033
01:14:07,699 --> 01:14:10,672
first-class ticket to
Bora Bora and enough cash...

1034
01:14:10,842 --> 01:14:13,673
Enough cash to make
a damn good life for yourself.

1035
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:15,855
Now, you're gonna
get in that car,

1036
01:14:15,865 --> 01:14:20,561
and you're gonna drive straight
to Dallas Fort Worth Airport

1037
01:14:20,567 --> 01:14:22,319
and nowhere else.

1038
01:14:23,689 --> 01:14:25,821
You don't even
stop to take a piss.

1039
01:14:25,831 --> 01:14:28,802
- You hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you.

1040
01:14:32,605 --> 01:14:33,805
Good luck, kid.

1041
01:14:44,693 --> 01:14:46,664
I'll tell you what, Barry.

1042
01:14:46,694 --> 01:14:49,636
I'm gonna send you a
goddamn address, okay, Barry?

1043
01:14:49,641 --> 01:14:52,757
You're gonna start sending
me cash on the fucking regular.

1044
01:14:52,762 --> 01:14:55,639
You understand?
You hear me?

1045
01:15:03,694 --> 01:15:05,665
Oh, and Barry...

1046
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:08,787
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you and my cunt sister!

1047
01:15:12,609 --> 01:15:15,632
Hey!

1048
01:15:15,642 --> 01:15:18,644
Money every week, asshole!

1049
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:31,861
What the fuck?

1050
01:15:37,815 --> 01:15:40,787
What?
Oh, shit.

1051
01:16:14,808 --> 01:16:16,779
Hey, hey! Barry!

1052
01:16:30,928 --> 01:16:32,729
Hey, Barry!

1053
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:34,761
Barry!

1054
01:16:34,766 --> 01:16:36,462
Yeah, Bill, what do you need?
What do you need?

1055
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:38,063
Man, man, I'm like
freakin' out, man.

1056
01:16:38,068 --> 01:16:39,874
What is goin' on with JB?

1057
01:16:40,844 --> 01:16:43,876
- Huh?
- Don't worry about JB.

1058
01:16:43,886 --> 01:16:45,827
What if he talks, man?

1059
01:16:45,832 --> 01:16:49,689
- He ain't gonna.
- Yeah, but what if he does?

1060
01:16:49,729 --> 01:16:53,763
- He ain't gonna talk, Bill.
- How do you know?

1061
01:16:53,803 --> 01:16:56,865
I am fucking positive.

1062
01:17:01,687 --> 01:17:02,948
Okay, man.

1063
01:17:02,953 --> 01:17:05,720
Good, I'm gonna trust
you on this one, man.

1064
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:06,921
Good.

1065
01:17:13,765 --> 01:17:16,166
In calendar year, your
operations have transported

1066
01:17:16,171 --> 01:17:18,868
10,500 Russian AKs
to the Contras.

1067
01:17:18,873 --> 01:17:19,968
Yeah.

1068
01:17:19,973 --> 01:17:24,022
5,000 of which, have found
themselves in the hands

1069
01:17:24,027 --> 01:17:25,688
of the Colombian Cartel.

1070
01:17:25,693 --> 01:17:28,214
- Right, but...
- Out of the 916 Contras

1071
01:17:28,219 --> 01:17:30,826
brought in to the
United States to train,

1072
01:17:30,831 --> 01:17:32,827
only half made it back
to Nicaragua.

1073
01:17:32,832 --> 01:17:35,959
- Half is...
- The other half are in the wild...

1074
01:18:00,714 --> 01:18:02,735
What's going on here?

1075
01:18:02,745 --> 01:18:06,748
Oh, yeah. We had to send
the Contras home.

1076
01:18:06,788 --> 01:18:08,989
- Home?
- Yeah.

1077
01:18:09,294 --> 01:18:11,080
They weren't fighting.

1078
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:13,902
That's the reality
of that situation.

1079
01:18:16,734 --> 01:18:19,795
You know, it didn't help that
their guns were in Colombia.

1080
01:18:19,805 --> 01:18:21,236
Did it, Barry?

1081
01:18:31,864 --> 01:18:34,735
So...

1082
01:18:37,907 --> 01:18:39,688
What now?

1083
01:18:39,888 --> 01:18:41,789
We'll call you.

1084
01:18:43,981 --> 01:18:47,012
Call me?
Schafer?

1085
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:49,424
Hey, Schafer.

1086
01:18:49,624 --> 01:18:51,175
Who the fuck's Schafer?

1087
01:18:56,838 --> 01:18:59,841
Okay, everybody.
You know the drill.

1088
01:18:59,846 --> 01:19:01,332
Everybody gets a burn bag.

1089
01:19:01,342 --> 01:19:03,873
Into it, you put anything
with Barry Seal's face

1090
01:19:03,883 --> 01:19:05,945
or name on it.

1091
01:19:08,826 --> 01:19:10,387
Come on, boys.
We gotta move.

1092
01:19:10,587 --> 01:19:12,989
We gotta get all this
stuff outta here.

1093
01:19:13,029 --> 01:19:16,711
- Pete. What, everything?
- Come on, boys, lets go.

1094
01:19:16,721 --> 01:19:18,802
We gotta move this out.
Let's go! Let's go!

1095
01:19:18,807 --> 01:19:20,903
Into the burn bag, go!

1096
01:19:20,908 --> 01:19:23,945
Purchase orders,
aircraft invoices,

1097
01:19:24,776 --> 01:19:26,797
Need a team here,
let's move it out.

1098
01:19:27,397 --> 01:19:29,809
Oh, shit, man.
Look at all these guns.

1099
01:19:29,819 --> 01:19:31,261
We gotta move all of it.

1100
01:19:31,461 --> 01:19:32,767
Where are we supposed
to put all this stuff?

1101
01:19:32,791 --> 01:19:33,952
Just get it off my property.

1102
01:19:33,962 --> 01:19:35,903
Anything with the words "Mena".

1103
01:19:35,908 --> 01:19:41,847
Fuel bills, memos, names,
directives, photos, anything like that,

1104
01:19:41,852 --> 01:19:43,854
anything that can link us with him,
you put in the burn bag...

1105
01:19:43,878 --> 01:19:45,939
and then what do you do with it?

1106
01:19:45,944 --> 01:19:47,400
- Burn it.
- You burn it.

1107
01:19:48,005 --> 01:19:49,912
Bob, I need a little help
back here.

1108
01:19:49,922 --> 01:19:52,953
- Gimme a hand with this shit.
- You got it.

1109
01:19:55,995 --> 01:20:00,038
Seal! DEA! Back away from the truck,
with your hands in the air.

1110
01:20:00,043 --> 01:20:02,029
Drop the fucking box, shithead!

1111
01:20:02,229 --> 01:20:04,471
Put up your hands!
Nice and high.

1112
01:20:06,042 --> 01:20:08,784
- ATF! Drop your weapons!
- What the fuck?

1113
01:20:08,789 --> 01:20:11,315
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! DEA!
- Lower your guns!

1114
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:13,076
Put your freaking guns down!

1115
01:20:13,081 --> 01:20:14,957
- Everybody's friends here!
- It's cool.

1116
01:20:14,962 --> 01:20:17,519
- DEA, all right?
- This is our collar.

1117
01:20:17,524 --> 01:20:20,771
- Bullshit.
- No, no, no, no.

1118
01:20:20,801 --> 01:20:22,001
State Police!

1119
01:20:22,006 --> 01:20:24,873
What the fuck
are ya'll doin' in my county?

1120
01:20:28,815 --> 01:20:30,877
Nobody move!

1121
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:34,929
FBI!

1122
01:20:43,775 --> 01:20:46,047
Well, hey, boys.
How about my phone call?

1123
01:20:51,850 --> 01:20:55,102
We're sorry, you have reached
a number that has been disconnected

1124
01:20:55,107 --> 01:20:56,993
- or is no longer in service.
- Bullshit.

1125
01:20:57,033 --> 01:21:00,025
If you feel you have reached
this recording in error...

1126
01:21:00,225 --> 01:21:01,526
Come on, Seal.

1127
01:21:10,882 --> 01:21:13,824
You know who I am, Mr. Seal?

1128
01:21:13,854 --> 01:21:16,916
- No, ma'am
- I'm Dana Sibota.

1129
01:21:17,026 --> 01:21:18,227
State Attorney General.

1130
01:21:18,427 --> 01:21:23,139
You've got DEA, ATF, FBI
all wantin' their pound of flesh.

1131
01:21:23,169 --> 01:21:26,231
Yes, ma'am, its...
It's quite a room.

1132
01:21:26,431 --> 01:21:29,143
Yeah. Well, you hit the trifecta,
didn't ya?

1133
01:21:29,153 --> 01:21:32,015
I mean, guns, drugs,
money launderin'.

1134
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:34,076
And the State of Arkansas,

1135
01:21:34,086 --> 01:21:37,568
is gonna rip the bark
right off o' you, boy.

1136
01:21:37,573 --> 01:21:41,626
We are gonna put you in a 4X6 cell
for the rest of your life.

1137
01:21:41,631 --> 01:21:44,833
- Ma'am, that's a long time.
- Yeah.

1138
01:21:44,843 --> 01:21:48,265
Miss Sibota,
I have Governor Clinton on the line.

1139
01:21:51,087 --> 01:21:52,418
He says it's urgent.

1140
01:21:57,131 --> 01:21:58,922
It's... the Governor.

1141
01:22:00,062 --> 01:22:02,123
It's the Governor.

1142
01:22:03,034 --> 01:22:06,036
Put him through. Clear the room.
Take him with you.

1143
01:22:06,076 --> 01:22:10,108
Yeah?
What do you need, Bill?

1144
01:22:10,148 --> 01:22:11,089
Did you all know

1145
01:22:11,094 --> 01:22:12,511
that Caddies have more trunk space

1146
01:22:12,516 --> 01:22:14,152
than any other car in the world?

1147
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:16,983
I'll give each and
every one of you a Caddy.

1148
01:22:18,024 --> 01:22:20,815
- Huh?
- You'd do that for all of us?

1149
01:22:21,016 --> 01:22:22,016
Yes, sir, I would.

1150
01:22:22,021 --> 01:22:24,778
I'd get all ya'll Caddies.
Have 'em here this afternoon.

1151
01:22:24,783 --> 01:22:27,034
What're you tryin' to do, Seal?
Add another 20 for bribery?

1152
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:28,986
Oh, no, no, no. I'm just offerin'
you Caddies for your troubles.

1153
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,881
What trouble, Seal?

1154
01:22:30,886 --> 01:22:32,943
Well, bringing me down here, for one.

1155
01:22:32,953 --> 01:22:37,065
See, Ima walk outta here.

1156
01:22:38,466 --> 01:22:40,677
Ima walk outta here.

1157
01:22:40,997 --> 01:22:44,159
And there ain't a damn thing
any one o' you can do about it.

1158
01:22:50,944 --> 01:22:52,105
Okay.

1159
01:22:56,958 --> 01:22:58,859
Do it.

1160
01:22:58,889 --> 01:23:02,381
- Wait, wait, wait a minute.
- No, no, no.

1161
01:23:02,386 --> 01:23:03,832
- He's free to go, boys.
- What the fuck?

1162
01:23:03,837 --> 01:23:05,319
What the hell do you mean,
"He's free to go"?

1163
01:23:05,343 --> 01:23:06,820
You wanna explain
what's goin' on here?

1164
01:23:06,844 --> 01:23:09,585
- He's free to go.
- Free to go?

1165
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:11,786
You boys shoulda taken the Caddies.

1166
01:23:14,388 --> 01:23:16,109
I'll be seein' you, Seal.

1167
01:23:17,521 --> 01:23:18,792
Ma'am.

1168
01:23:20,933 --> 01:23:22,534
I tell ya,

1169
01:23:22,734 --> 01:23:25,015
It is good to see you boys,
I ain't gonna lie.

1170
01:23:25,806 --> 01:23:27,767
But I figured you would
have to show up, see.

1171
01:23:27,867 --> 01:23:29,268
I just know too much.

1172
01:23:29,368 --> 01:23:31,269
Schafer sent you, right?

1173
01:23:31,749 --> 01:23:33,811
Who the fuck is Schafer?

1174
01:23:34,311 --> 01:23:37,613
Talking Heads -
"Slippery People"

1175

Nancy...

1188
01:24:22,231 --> 01:24:25,323
Not log ago, I was asked
by a group of children what to do

1189
01:24:25,333 --> 01:24:27,274
if they were offered drugs.

1190
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:30,206
And I answered, "Just say no".

1191
01:24:30,211 --> 01:24:33,108
Drug criminals are ingenious.

1192
01:24:33,148 --> 01:24:37,180
So we must be smarter and stronger
and tougher than they are.

1193
01:24:37,190 --> 01:24:39,151
Say yes to your life.

1194
01:24:39,156 --> 01:24:42,183
And when it comes to
drugs and alcohol...

1195
01:24:42,223 --> 01:24:43,394
just say no.

1196
01:24:46,235 --> 01:24:48,297
You a pilot?

1197
01:24:49,337 --> 01:24:52,209
- I've been known to fly some.
- Me too.

1198
01:24:52,214 --> 01:24:55,412
Air National Guard.
'68 to '69.

1199
01:24:55,417 --> 01:24:57,283
Junior?

1200
01:24:59,224 --> 01:25:02,356
Well, see you around, flyboy.

1201
01:25:03,266 --> 01:25:05,358

1205
01:25:11,616 --> 01:25:13,893
the American flag in the streets.

1206
01:25:14,243 --> 01:25:18,625
Please. There is no deal
if we don't get the Sandinistas.

1207
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:19,766
- Then there's no deal.
- Horseshit.

1208
01:25:19,771 --> 01:25:21,647
There's no deal
unless we get Medellin.

1209
01:25:21,652 --> 01:25:24,489
Now, you may be wondering why
my ass wasn't in jail at this point.

1210
01:25:24,529 --> 01:25:26,821
This is disgusting!

1211
01:25:26,826 --> 01:25:28,922
Now, I gotta be honest.
Frankly, so was I.

1212
01:25:29,503 --> 01:25:32,304
This fella here, is with the DEA.

1213
01:25:32,309 --> 01:25:35,276
And this fella here, is a colonel
named Ollie North.

1214
01:25:35,316 --> 01:25:37,027
Reagan's go-to guy.

1215
01:25:37,227 --> 01:25:41,180
The DEA just wants to nail the
Medellin Cartel once and for all.

1216
01:25:41,185 --> 01:25:43,311
Now, at the same time,
Colonel North wants to prove

1217
01:25:43,316 --> 01:25:46,763
that commies in Central America
are involved in the drug trade.

1218
01:25:46,768 --> 01:25:49,019
- Let me say that again,
- This is disgusting!

1219
01:25:49,024 --> 01:25:50,665
Colonel North wants to prove

1220
01:25:50,670 --> 01:25:52,927
that commies are dealing drugs.

1221
01:25:52,947 --> 01:25:54,407
And why am I in the room?

1222
01:25:55,048 --> 01:25:57,409
'Cause I'm the gringo
who always delivers.

1223
01:25:58,451 --> 01:26:01,553
So you want me to keep going?

1224
01:26:01,693 --> 01:26:03,554
For your country.

1225
01:26:04,494 --> 01:26:06,626
We're gonna bring these guys down.

1226
01:26:06,666 --> 01:26:09,397
And you're gonna be a hero.

1227
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:15,641
All right then.

1228
01:26:18,052 --> 01:26:20,114
They put me right
back in business.

1229
01:26:20,524 --> 01:26:22,935
Now, I'm working
for the White House.

1230
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:24,806
All right you have three cameras.

1231
01:26:24,811 --> 01:26:26,407
50-picture loads each.

1232
01:26:26,457 --> 01:26:28,564
You have one here in a bag.

1233
01:26:28,579 --> 01:26:31,011
The sightline goes
straight down the back

1234
01:26:31,016 --> 01:26:32,552
to where those
two gentlemen are now.

1235
01:26:33,192 --> 01:26:35,934
You have two more cameras
above each door.

1236
01:26:36,004 --> 01:26:40,046
Sightlines directly
in front of the door.

1237
01:26:43,588 --> 01:26:45,059
Each camera has a cord.

1238
01:26:45,169 --> 01:26:48,531
You just press this button
to take a picture.

1239
01:26:50,162 --> 01:26:51,763
That's it.

1240
01:26:52,734 --> 01:26:54,205
Let's go.

1241
01:26:56,676 --> 01:26:58,417
I can see the cords, Barry.

1242
01:26:59,628 --> 01:27:01,079
Yeah.

1243
01:27:03,991 --> 01:27:05,682
I can see this damn cord

1244
01:27:05,883 --> 01:27:07,603
which means they're
gonna be able to see it.

1245
01:27:08,534 --> 01:27:10,695
- We'll hide it.
- I'm not a photographer.

1246
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:12,106
- Your thumb work?
- Yeah.

1247
01:27:12,111 --> 01:27:13,957
Well, you just push a button.

1248
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:16,039
When am I supposed to
press the button?

1249
01:27:16,809 --> 01:27:20,371
When the guys are standin' here
holdin' the powder.

1250
01:27:20,381 --> 01:27:22,803
You know what, fuck it, Pete.
I'll take the pictures.

1251
01:27:22,808 --> 01:27:24,003
Fuck.

1252
01:27:24,008 --> 01:27:26,985
Listen, once we have
one of these photos,

1253
01:27:27,025 --> 01:27:29,997
who exactly is
gonna be lookin' at 'em?

1254
01:27:30,027 --> 01:27:32,528
These photos are gonna be
on a need-to-know basis.

1255
01:27:32,533 --> 01:27:33,729
Need-to-know.

1256
01:27:33,734 --> 01:27:37,002
They're gonna be classified
at the highest levels, Barry.

1257
01:27:37,012 --> 01:27:39,033
- Daddy!
- Classified.

1258
01:27:41,114 --> 01:27:44,957
We do recognize
the dangers involved here.

1259
01:27:47,928 --> 01:27:49,059
No, you don't.

1260
01:27:51,130 --> 01:27:53,061
Or you can always
tell us to fuck off

1261
01:27:53,066 --> 01:27:55,873
and spend the next
30 years in Leavenworth.

1262
01:27:55,903 --> 01:27:59,975
Come on, Boss!
Let's get this over with!

1263
01:28:05,018 --> 01:28:07,021
I'll see you, Rangel.

1264
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:12,094
- Smile, Barry!
- Bye, Daddy!

1265
01:29:08,928 --> 01:29:12,021
Shit, there's a fuckin'
army up there.

1266
01:29:15,033 --> 01:29:17,804
They're gonna torture us.

1267
01:29:17,944 --> 01:29:20,216
Pull our tongues out
through our necks.

1268
01:29:20,346 --> 01:29:21,797
That ain't helpin', Pete.

1269
01:29:21,802 --> 01:29:23,608
They gonna cut us up
in little pieces.

1270
01:29:23,618 --> 01:29:27,580
Feed us to the pigs.
I won't be fed in no pigs, Barry.

1271
01:29:28,421 --> 01:29:31,333
We gotta keep our shit together.
Hola!

1272
01:29:34,504 --> 01:29:36,566
We're gettin' yayo.

1273
01:29:36,606 --> 01:29:40,418
Take these damn pictures,
and get the hell outta here.

1274
01:29:40,423 --> 01:29:41,619
Keep our shit together.

1275
01:29:42,079 --> 01:29:43,771
Raise your hand!

1276
01:29:44,582 --> 01:29:45,582
Fuck.

1277
01:29:45,782 --> 01:29:48,424
Hello. No, no, no.

1278
01:29:50,925 --> 01:29:52,756
Amigos!

1279
01:29:52,796 --> 01:29:54,998
They're gonna hear that
goddamn camera, Barry.

1280
01:29:55,503 --> 01:29:57,099
Amigos.

1281
01:30:02,882 --> 01:30:05,114
Escobar, Ochoa.

1282
01:30:05,154 --> 01:30:07,955
Raise your hand!

1283
01:30:16,701 --> 01:30:18,603
Hey, hola.

1284
01:30:18,643 --> 01:30:21,634
Amigo.
Que paso?

1285
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:31,940
What's this?

1286
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:35,763
Regalos para Escobar y Ochoa.

1287
01:30:43,177 --> 01:30:45,208
Hey, Jorge!

1288
01:30:45,248 --> 01:30:47,189
Jorge, fuck.

1289
01:30:47,219 --> 01:30:48,411
Come on, man.

1290
01:30:50,192 --> 01:30:51,673
A little help.

1291
01:30:51,873 --> 01:30:53,194
Shoot the gringos.

1292
01:30:53,594 --> 01:30:55,185
What?

1293
01:30:55,275 --> 01:30:56,556
Shoot the gringos.

1294
01:30:56,606 --> 01:30:58,717
- What'd you say?
- Shoot the gringos!

1295
01:30:58,817 --> 01:31:00,478
Shoot the gringos!

1296
01:31:00,678 --> 01:31:01,979
No, no, no, no.

1297
01:31:02,079 --> 01:31:03,360
No.

1298
01:31:12,225 --> 01:31:13,896
You fucker.

1299
01:31:17,068 --> 01:31:18,849
Bad for crazy gringos.

1300
01:31:19,549 --> 01:31:20,941
Ochoa!

1301
01:31:21,141 --> 01:31:22,942
What the fuck is this, Ochoa?

1302
01:31:25,084 --> 01:31:26,875
Stand the fuck up.

1303
01:31:27,885 --> 01:31:29,847
Hey, you're shaking.
You're shaking.

1304
01:31:29,852 --> 01:31:31,247
Look at this.

1305
01:31:31,427 --> 01:31:34,049
Hey, he pissed himself, man.

1306
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:37,631
You got me.
That was a good one.

1307
01:31:37,831 --> 01:31:39,162
That was a good one.

1308
01:31:41,974 --> 01:31:43,915
I saved your life, Barry.

1309
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,666
- I saved your life, eh.
- Yes, you did.

1310
01:31:45,671 --> 01:31:47,317
- Remember that.
- Yeah.

1311
01:31:47,322 --> 01:31:48,883
Remember.
Crazy gringo.

1312
01:31:49,148 --> 01:31:50,339
Come here, Barry.

1313
01:31:55,583 --> 01:31:57,644
Hey, Jorge.

1314
01:31:57,684 --> 01:31:59,585
Now, let's go say hi to Pablo.

1315
01:31:59,815 --> 01:32:01,076
Pablo's here?

1316
01:32:01,081 --> 01:32:03,778
Si. He's paranoid, amigo.
On edge.

1317
01:32:03,828 --> 01:32:05,519
Thinks everyone
is out to get him.

1318
01:32:05,719 --> 01:32:07,860
Hola, Pablo!

1319
01:32:12,843 --> 01:32:14,644
Let's do it

1320
01:32:14,649 --> 01:32:16,215
Let's do it

1321
01:32:16,433 --> 01:32:17,641
Are we good?

1322
01:32:17,646 --> 01:32:18,706
What?

1323
01:32:20,617 --> 01:32:21,718
Are we good?

1324
01:32:24,861 --> 01:32:26,692
Are we good, Barry?

1325
01:32:28,663 --> 01:32:30,865
Si... Si.

1326
01:32:32,836 --> 01:32:34,807
Estoy aqui.

1327
01:32:35,807 --> 01:32:37,278
Estoy aqui.

1328
01:32:40,650 --> 01:32:42,752
Y traje tus Harleys.

1329
01:32:47,454 --> 01:32:48,955
Ah, okay.

1330
01:32:49,966 --> 01:32:51,707
So? We're still friends?

1331
01:32:53,678 --> 01:32:54,839
That was a good one

1332
01:32:54,879 --> 01:32:58,212
that you pulled right there.
You really got me.

1333
01:32:58,317 --> 01:32:59,727
This dude.

1334
01:32:59,733 --> 01:33:01,109
Hey, you know, I'm gonna
have to get you back.

1335
01:33:01,133 --> 01:33:03,044
What's he saying?

1336
01:33:03,054 --> 01:33:05,186
He's gonna get us back
on that joke, Pablo.

1337
01:33:05,191 --> 01:33:06,376
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

1338
01:33:06,577 --> 01:33:09,678
Soul, Inc. -
"Ultra Blue"

1339
01:33:09,828 --> 01:33:11,670
Jorge...

1340
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:13,641
Look at this, my friend.

1341
01:33:13,841 --> 01:33:16,232
Say cheese, motherfuckers.

1342
01:33:16,237 --> 01:33:18,003
We're gonna make history.

1343
01:33:27,379 --> 01:33:28,651
Barry Seal!

1344
01:33:28,851 --> 01:33:31,993
Barry Seal...
He's a goddamn genius.

1345
01:33:31,998 --> 01:33:33,593
- Yay!
- Yay!

1346
01:33:33,874 --> 01:33:35,590
There seems to be no crime

1347
01:33:35,595 --> 01:33:38,011
to which the Sandinistas
will not stoop.

1348
01:33:38,016 --> 01:33:40,918
This is an outlaw regime.

1349
01:33:40,948 --> 01:33:43,249
The Sandinistas have even
involved themselves

1350
01:33:43,254 --> 01:33:45,270
in the international drug trade.

1351
01:33:45,275 --> 01:33:46,791
I know every American parent

1352
01:33:46,796 --> 01:33:49,663
concerned about the
drug problem will be outraged

1353
01:33:49,668 --> 01:33:52,875
to learn that top Nicaraguan
government officials

1354
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:55,506
are deeply involved
in drug trafficking.

1355
01:33:55,887 --> 01:33:59,018
This picture, secretly taken
at a military airfield

1356
01:33:59,023 --> 01:34:01,121
outside Managua,

1357
01:34:01,126 --> 01:34:04,393
shows Federico Vaughan,
a top aide to one of

1358
01:34:04,398 --> 01:34:06,944
the nine comandantes
who rule Nicaragua...

1359
01:34:06,949 --> 01:34:07,955
Fuck!

1360
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:09,776
Loading an aircraft
with illegal narcotics

1361
01:34:09,781 --> 01:34:13,658
Motherfuckers! That's your
fucking face, Barry!

1362
01:34:13,663 --> 01:34:15,609
This is a outlaw regime.

1363
01:34:15,619 --> 01:34:17,010
Oh, my God.

1364
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:18,101
Just as you said, Pablo.

1365
01:34:18,111 --> 01:34:19,592
That son of a bitch.

1366
01:34:21,132 --> 01:34:22,974
Pablo, we must face
it immediately.

1367
01:34:27,206 --> 01:34:28,607
- Go on.
- Yes, sir.

1368
01:34:32,149 --> 01:34:35,002
I am truly sorry, Barry.
North jumped the gun.

1369
01:34:35,202 --> 01:34:38,013
Well, you boys fucked me good.

1370
01:34:38,018 --> 01:34:39,094
We all got fucked.

1371
01:34:39,099 --> 01:34:41,155
Those photos weren't
supposed to be released.

1372
01:34:41,195 --> 01:34:44,097
And certainly not until
we had the Colombians in custody.

1373
01:34:44,107 --> 01:34:45,863
Yeah, well, he ain't
gonna be comin' for you.

1374
01:34:45,868 --> 01:34:48,164
Barry, you knew the risks

1375
01:34:48,169 --> 01:34:49,520
when you took those pictures.

1376
01:34:52,282 --> 01:34:55,114
You knew what you were doing.

1377
01:34:57,555 --> 01:34:59,546
Barry?

1378
01:35:00,597 --> 01:35:02,218
Barry, you there?

1379
01:35:17,758 --> 01:35:19,789
Let's go get some ice cream.

1380
01:35:30,275 --> 01:35:34,278
The Feds. They're gonna
try to take everything.

1381
01:35:35,248 --> 01:35:37,149
When they come...

1382
01:35:37,259 --> 01:35:39,221
you gotta put on
all your jewelry.

1383
01:35:39,262 --> 01:35:42,623
All your rings.
Your bracelets.

1384
01:35:44,264 --> 01:35:45,325
Necklace.

1385
01:35:46,336 --> 01:35:49,307
If you wearin' it, they can't
take it away from you.

1386
01:35:50,208 --> 01:35:52,309
You understand?

1387
01:35:52,910 --> 01:35:55,601
And that's insurance for you
and the kids.

1388
01:35:55,611 --> 01:35:56,982
All right?

1389
01:35:58,723 --> 01:35:59,734
I understand.

1390
01:35:59,739 --> 01:36:01,985
All right, don't forget that.
It's gonna be all right.

1391
01:36:02,996 --> 01:36:06,568
- It's gonna be all right, I love you.
- I love you.

1392
01:36:06,838 --> 01:36:09,029
Sure enough, they came.

1393
01:36:11,582 --> 01:36:13,142
And they took it all.

1394
01:36:31,203 --> 01:36:33,765
Hey, you know, Luce, honey...

1395
01:36:33,845 --> 01:36:35,215
I was thinkin'...

1396
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:38,818
that you might like to move
back to Baton Rouge.

1397
01:36:38,823 --> 01:36:40,689
You ain't gonna find
nothin' in those drawers.

1398
01:36:41,929 --> 01:36:44,712
Try the hat boxes,
third shelf up.

1399
01:36:45,132 --> 01:36:47,454
I mean, you loved it there.

1400
01:36:48,404 --> 01:36:50,015
What about you?

1401
01:36:50,606 --> 01:36:52,707
I mean, I...

1402
01:36:53,007 --> 01:36:57,079
Me...
Listen, see...

1403
01:36:59,221 --> 01:37:01,802
Look, if I run, they're uh...

1404
01:37:02,523 --> 01:37:05,945
They're gonna come
for you and the kids. I mean...

1405
01:37:06,995 --> 01:37:09,327
That's how a thing like this goes.

1406
01:37:09,332 --> 01:37:11,768
But in Baton Rouge, you're safe.

1407
01:37:15,251 --> 01:37:16,922
No.

1408
01:37:17,152 --> 01:37:19,534
No, I ain't goin' nowhere.

1409
01:37:20,054 --> 01:37:22,906
We're a family,
and we're stayin' together.

1410
01:37:22,911 --> 01:37:24,126
- I know, but...
- No, sir!

1411
01:37:24,131 --> 01:37:25,837
- I ain't doin' this. No.
- Listen, Luce...

1412
01:37:25,842 --> 01:37:29,459
No, no. Honey, no.
Don't do this now.

1413
01:37:29,469 --> 01:37:31,145
Sir, sir, I'm sorry, no, no, no.

1414
01:37:31,271 --> 01:37:32,626
Come on, sir.

1415
01:37:32,641 --> 01:37:34,232
Excuse me,
she's wearin' this now.

1416
01:37:34,713 --> 01:37:36,123
Luce, you gotta stop. Hey.

1417
01:37:36,128 --> 01:37:38,365
You know, fellas!
Sorry, hey...

1418
01:37:38,370 --> 01:37:39,946
Can I just have a moment?

1419
01:37:39,956 --> 01:37:42,057
Can I just have a moment
with my wife?

1420
01:37:42,067 --> 01:37:43,532
It's been a hell of a day.

1421
01:37:43,928 --> 01:37:45,949
- Okay, Barry.
- Yeah.

1422
01:37:45,979 --> 01:37:47,421
You got one minute.

1423
01:37:47,431 --> 01:37:49,722
All right, Luce?
Honey, honey...

1424
01:37:49,727 --> 01:37:50,653
- Honey, listen to me.
- Let's give him a minute.

1425
01:37:50,658 --> 01:37:53,229
- Baby, baby, listen to me.
- All right, fellas, head on out.

1426
01:37:53,234 --> 01:37:54,265
Listen to me now.

1427
01:37:58,047 --> 01:37:59,698
Ima go to prison.

1428
01:37:59,703 --> 01:38:02,640
I'm gonna do just-
just a little time.

1429
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:05,802
And Ima be fine there.

1430
01:38:06,362 --> 01:38:08,600
And we'll work everything out.

1431
01:38:08,844 --> 01:38:11,555
But I gotta know
you gonna be safe.

1432
01:38:15,978 --> 01:38:18,249
It's gonna be all right.

1433
01:38:19,781 --> 01:38:21,552
You gotta trust me.

1434
01:38:21,852 --> 01:38:23,583
You trust me, right?

1435
01:38:24,154 --> 01:38:25,680
Fuck no!

1436
01:38:27,866 --> 01:38:29,157
All right.

1437
01:38:41,584 --> 01:38:44,916
Luce and the kids finally
did move to Baton Rouge.

1438
01:38:48,168 --> 01:38:51,301
How can we have a war on drugs...

1439
01:38:51,306 --> 01:38:52,671
when the biggest
enemy of the state

1440
