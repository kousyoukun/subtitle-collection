1
00:03:02,394 --> 00:03:04,123
Hey, Mr. Wilson!

2
00:03:33,992 --> 00:03:35,152
Mr. Wilson.

3
00:03:37,863 --> 00:03:39,763
Mr. Wilson?

4
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,498
Mr. Wilson?

5
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,703
Poor old Mr. Wilson must be so sick.

6
00:03:53,178 --> 00:03:55,043
No wonder he ain't up.

7
00:04:04,222 --> 00:04:05,450
Wow!

8
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:09,226
His heart sounds like our washing machine!

9
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:17,293
Oh, no.

10
00:04:17,502 --> 00:04:19,732
He's growing extra skin.

11
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:46,520
His tongue's very ugly...

12
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,299
...and blue and spotty.

13
00:04:53,638 --> 00:04:54,730
Cool!

14
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,271
He feels warm.

15
00:05:02,781 --> 00:05:04,578
He has a temperature.

16
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,947
I know what you need.

17
00:05:07,485 --> 00:05:08,884
You need an aspirin.

18
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:33,459
Don't you ever come back!
Do you hear me?

19
00:06:33,571 --> 00:06:34,731
Never!

20
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,666
Starting part time will give you a chance
to ease back into it.

21
00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:41,735
I mean, managing shopping malls
can't be much more difficult...

22
00:06:41,813 --> 00:06:43,405
...than managing Dennis.

23
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:45,810
Where have you been?

24
00:06:46,384 --> 00:06:47,373
Dennis?

25
00:06:48,653 --> 00:06:49,642
Dennis?

26
00:06:50,388 --> 00:06:52,515
I was at Mr. Wilson's house.

27
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:54,788
And, boy, is he sick.

28
00:06:55,026 --> 00:06:57,654
He's got a fever, and he's burning up.

29
00:06:58,129 --> 00:06:59,756
I better call Martha.

30
00:06:59,831 --> 00:07:02,391
You didn't bother him, did you?

31
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:04,860
No, but I gave him an aspirin.

32
00:07:04,936 --> 00:07:07,769
And he don't like them any better than me.

33
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,876
You shouldn't visit people
so early in the morning.

34
00:07:11,977 --> 00:07:15,174
That's the only time I know for sure
they'll be home.

35
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:16,975
Hello, George. Alice Mitchell.

36
00:07:17,048 --> 00:07:19,209
Are you feeling all right?
Dennis said that you...

37
00:07:19,284 --> 00:07:20,251
<i>Feeling all right!</i>

38
00:07:20,318 --> 00:07:24,482
<i>Your son just shot an aspirin</i>
<i>down my throat with a slingshot!</i>

39
00:07:24,556 --> 00:07:25,955
I'm very sorry.

40
00:07:26,024 --> 00:07:27,389
<i>You better talk to him!</i>

41
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:28,790
We'll talk to him.

42
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,693
<i>When I was a child,</i>
<i>none of this would have been tolerated!</i>

43
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:33,521
'Bye. 'Bye.

44
00:07:41,106 --> 00:07:42,130
Hi.

45
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,310
Did you shoot an aspirin
into Mr. Wilson's mouth?

46
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:49,836
I didn't want him to bite off my fingers
with his big, fake teeth.

47
00:07:49,914 --> 00:07:51,814
Those things are sharp!

48
00:07:52,951 --> 00:07:56,352
George said Dennis shot an aspirin
into his mouth with a slingshot.

49
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:57,581
What slingshot?

50
00:07:57,655 --> 00:07:59,520
- Do you have a slingshot?
- I'm not sure.

51
00:07:59,591 --> 00:08:00,922
Give it to me.

52
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:08,465
Mr. Wilson is very angry with you.

53
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,460
I thought he was sick.
I was only trying to help.

54
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:14,570
You go sit in the corner
and think about what you've done.

55
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,739
- For how long?
- Until you're sorry.

56
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:18,298
Oh, good. I'm sorry now.

57
00:08:18,877 --> 00:08:19,969
He can't sit in the corner.

58
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:22,843
I have to take him
to Margaret Wade's house.

59
00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:25,414
Margaret's house!

60
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:28,782
I didn't do anything bad enough
to deserve to go to her house.

61
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:31,686
She's a lunatic. I'll go crazy.
She tortures me.

62
00:08:31,756 --> 00:08:34,589
She's mean. She's ugly.
She doesn't share!

63
00:08:35,593 --> 00:08:40,087
I arranged with Mrs. Wade for you
to go to their house while I work.

64
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,464
Are you serious?

65
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:45,401
You can't spend the summer unsupervised.
You're out of school.

66
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,767
I'll go back.

67
00:08:46,838 --> 00:08:50,865
Your mother made arrangements.
That's it! I don't want any arguments.

68
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:57,004
My life is falling apart.

69
00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:08,053
Hello, George.

70
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,895
Let me take that off your hands. Sorry.

71
00:09:14,866 --> 00:09:15,855
I'm<i>...</i>

72
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:20,130
I'm sorry about this morning.

73
00:09:21,272 --> 00:09:23,968
I won't mince words, Mitchell.

74
00:09:24,742 --> 00:09:26,869
Your kid is driving me nuts.

75
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:30,514
- I'll talk to him again.
- Maybe it isn't talk that he needs.

76
00:09:30,582 --> 00:09:34,450
When my dad had something important
to tell me, he told me with his belt.

77
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,953
That's not how I deal with my son,
Mr. Wilson.

78
00:09:37,188 --> 00:09:38,382
However you deal with him...

79
00:09:38,456 --> 00:09:43,052
...he hasn't learned you don't shoot
an aspirin down a fellow's throat!

80
00:09:43,194 --> 00:09:46,425
- Mr. Wilson, he's five.
- When I was five, I had some respect.

81
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:49,399
You were probably an exceptional boy.

82
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:53,267
In 1925, I was not the exception,
I was the rule.

83
00:09:53,338 --> 00:09:55,670
I'll make sure
Dennis doesn't come by anymore.

84
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,571
Careful how you say it.

85
00:09:57,642 --> 00:10:01,009
I don't want everybody to think
I'm a child-hater or an ogre.

86
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:04,311
I'm a reasonable man
who expects reasonable treatment...

87
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:06,373
...from his neighbors and their children.

88
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:10,046
I was with the post office
for more than 43 years, and never once...

89
00:10:10,121 --> 00:10:11,247
I'm running a little late.

90
00:10:11,322 --> 00:10:14,257
I'll come by after work
and we can continue the conversation.

91
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:17,783
There's nothing to continue.
I've said my piece. We'll leave it at that.

92
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:21,195
The boy cannot come over here
unless he behaves himself.

93
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:22,699
He won't be over at all.

94
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:26,794
Now don't make me out to be a grump.
I didn't say '<i>'</i>never.'<i>'</i> I said...

95
00:10:26,871 --> 00:10:28,736
I really have to go.

96
00:10:29,674 --> 00:10:31,608
Well, now, don't<i>...</i>

97
00:10:34,712 --> 00:10:36,304
Have a good day.

98
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:38,746
He's out of school now.

99
00:10:38,816 --> 00:10:41,307
He can't spend all his free time here.

100
00:10:41,386 --> 00:10:44,014
I'm not the bad guy in this, Mitchell.

101
00:10:44,122 --> 00:10:45,646
I'm the victim!

102
00:10:46,925 --> 00:10:49,519
George, who were you shouting at?

103
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:53,562
Mitchell, and I wasn't shouting.
I was making my point.

104
00:10:53,798 --> 00:10:57,165
It's not right that his youngster
can run wild doing as he pleases...

105
00:10:57,235 --> 00:10:59,965
...without regard to people or property.

106
00:11:00,071 --> 00:11:02,039
He's only a boy, George.

107
00:11:02,207 --> 00:11:04,107
He'll knot my rope once too often.

108
00:11:04,175 --> 00:11:07,008
I can't stand that kid! He's a menace!

109
00:11:07,378 --> 00:11:11,781
You'd better come in and have breakfast.
We're due at the Garden Club at 9:00.

110
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:16,987
Today is an important day for me, and
I'm already in a lather because of that kid.

111
00:11:17,055 --> 00:11:20,388
I don't know if I'll even be able
to enjoy my moment of triumph.

112
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,426
Don't get your hopes up.

113
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,093
There are lots of other gardens in town
just as nice as yours.

114
00:11:26,164 --> 00:11:28,029
Please! I'm a shoe-in.

115
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:34,803
Who else has a night-blooming mock orchid
flowering this year?

116
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,135
It's an awfully homely looking plant.

117
00:11:39,444 --> 00:11:41,309
Hang the looks of the thing!

118
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:44,280
It opens before your eyes
in the light of the full moon.

119
00:11:44,349 --> 00:11:45,907
It's a marvel, Martha.

120
00:11:45,984 --> 00:11:48,418
Forty years to mature and blossom.

121
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,848
The flower opens and withers
in a matter of moments.

122
00:11:51,923 --> 00:11:54,585
There isn't a gardener in town
with a plant that requires...

123
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:58,322
...a 40-year investment
for 10 seconds of splendor.

124
00:12:11,342 --> 00:12:13,742
How do you feel about me working?

125
00:12:16,214 --> 00:12:17,943
A lot of moms work.

126
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,884
The best I could do finding someone
to watch you is Mrs. Wade.

127
00:12:25,156 --> 00:12:28,319
What about Joey?
Did you think about him?

128
00:12:28,426 --> 00:12:31,953
What if he comes over?
He'll think I moved.

129
00:12:32,063 --> 00:12:35,464
Joey's mother made plans
with Mrs. Wade just like I did.

130
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,793
Joey's at Margaret's house.

131
00:12:46,044 --> 00:12:47,204
Do it!

132
00:12:48,746 --> 00:12:51,214
- I can make you.
- How?

133
00:12:52,817 --> 00:12:54,478
I'll slug you back.

134
00:12:54,552 --> 00:12:57,350
- You can't hit a girl.
- I can too.

135
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:00,852
Try it. I'll scream
so awfully, bloody, deadly horrible...

136
00:13:00,925 --> 00:13:02,916
...my mom'll think you tried to murder me.

137
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:07,930
I'll say you did and she'll believe it.
Because boys are like that and girls aren't.

138
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,565
That really stinks.

139
00:13:09,634 --> 00:13:10,601
Quit wasting time.

140
00:13:10,668 --> 00:13:13,865
Mush your lips together
and let's get this over with.

141
00:13:18,376 --> 00:13:19,968
Close your eyes!

142
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:27,845
Kiss me.

143
00:13:34,926 --> 00:13:36,723
All right. Let's go.

144
00:13:37,362 --> 00:13:38,693
Dennis, come on.

145
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:40,258
Oh, gosh.

146
00:13:40,365 --> 00:13:42,128
Acting like a baby.

147
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:45,191
Get up!

148
00:13:46,437 --> 00:13:48,166
Right this instant!

149
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:51,300
Don't you dare embarrass me!

150
00:13:53,077 --> 00:13:55,307
Fine, I'll drag you inside.

151
00:13:59,817 --> 00:14:03,014
You guys are the boring ones.
There's lots to do.

152
00:14:03,554 --> 00:14:05,419
Oh, really? Like what?

153
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,624
We could practice singing songs.

154
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:09,057
Or put on a play...

155
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:10,822
...or a puppet show.

156
00:14:10,895 --> 00:14:14,524
- We could bury you alive.
- I could pound your face.

157
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:17,126
It doesn't matter, anyways, Margaret.

158
00:14:17,668 --> 00:14:20,569
We'll be leaving soon
and we have work to do.

159
00:14:20,638 --> 00:14:22,572
We're going to make a fort.

160
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:26,404
You can't leave unless I go with you,
or I'll tell on you.

161
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:28,775
So, tough kitty paws, I'm going.

162
00:14:29,013 --> 00:14:32,073
Climb down from there. I'll get my purse.

163
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:09,745
This thing's been here our whole life
and we never knew it.

164
00:15:09,821 --> 00:15:13,518
- Do you think anybody lives in it?
- Just squirrels and birds.

165
00:15:13,591 --> 00:15:15,491
It looks kind of junky.

166
00:15:15,726 --> 00:15:17,125
We'll fix it up.

167
00:15:17,428 --> 00:15:19,521
Good. I'll be the decorator.

168
00:15:19,597 --> 00:15:23,863
We'll put on a special room for the babies
and a powder room for guests.

169
00:15:24,435 --> 00:15:26,665
Forts don't have powder rooms.

170
00:15:27,205 --> 00:15:28,172
Really?

171
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:31,231
Where do the soldiers' wives go
to freshen up?

172
00:15:31,676 --> 00:15:34,975
Soldiers don't have wives, stupid.

173
00:15:35,446 --> 00:15:39,143
Don't call me stupid, baby rump kisser!

174
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:44,117
It won't be a fort. It'll be a house.

175
00:15:44,422 --> 00:15:45,821
A love nest.

176
00:15:46,724 --> 00:15:50,023
Let's go up and see
what color carpet we should get.

177
00:15:50,528 --> 00:15:52,291
Do forts got carpet?

178
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,562
Nope.

179
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:55,997
Forts don't got carpet!

180
00:15:56,534 --> 00:15:58,399
They do now, hot lips!

181
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,302
The Selection Committee has informed...

182
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,910
...Mrs. Butterwell and I...

183
00:16:08,112 --> 00:16:12,913
...that this summer's Floraganza
will be held in the garden of<i>...</i>

184
00:16:17,288 --> 00:16:19,051
Can you read this here?

185
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:25,385
You take these and I'll take those.

186
00:16:26,797 --> 00:16:29,595
There we go. The garden of...

187
00:16:32,003 --> 00:16:33,664
...George Wilson!

188
00:16:44,282 --> 00:16:48,343
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi, three Mississippi...

189
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:50,887
...four Mississippi, five Mississippi.

190
00:16:50,955 --> 00:16:52,149
Six Mississippi...

191
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:56,660
...seven Mississippi, eight Mississippi,
nine Mississippi.

192
00:16:56,928 --> 00:16:59,988
Gunther, are you watching
where everybody goes?

193
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:02,256
Yep.

194
00:17:06,437 --> 00:17:08,268
Girls. Now<i>...</i>

195
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:12,373
Let's go!

196
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,781
You know,
I was unbeatable at hide-and-seek.

197
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,415
Hiding or seeking?

198
00:17:20,484 --> 00:17:23,078
Both. I had a nose for hiding places.

199
00:17:23,654 --> 00:17:25,849
I wouldn't think you'd be much good
at hiding.

200
00:17:25,923 --> 00:17:27,151
Why not?

201
00:17:27,325 --> 00:17:29,190
Weren't you a fat boy?

202
00:17:30,595 --> 00:17:31,994
I was husky.

203
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:35,358
Ready or not, here I come!

204
00:17:38,469 --> 00:17:39,663
I see Joey and Mike!

205
00:17:39,737 --> 00:17:41,102
Run, Mikey!

206
00:17:41,672 --> 00:17:43,162
He's cheating.

207
00:17:44,408 --> 00:17:46,069
What are you doing?

208
00:17:46,978 --> 00:17:50,744
Dennis is cheating.
He's using the Beckman kid as a spy.

209
00:17:51,148 --> 00:17:53,309
Leave them alone, George.

210
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:55,547
I'll even things up.

211
00:17:55,853 --> 00:18:00,449
Gunther, I'm just talking to your daddy
on the telephone.

212
00:18:00,658 --> 00:18:04,526
He's going to the ice-cream store.
He wants to take you with him.

213
00:18:04,962 --> 00:18:06,987
Hurry up and go home!

214
00:18:10,234 --> 00:18:11,758
Now it's fair.

215
00:18:15,106 --> 00:18:17,336
You lied to a toddler, George.

216
00:18:18,542 --> 00:18:21,773
Think how disappointed he will be
when he gets home.

217
00:18:21,846 --> 00:18:25,873
He better get used to it.
Disappointment will be a big part of his life.

218
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,818
He's a foot short for his age.
And he's cross-eyed.

219
00:19:29,547 --> 00:19:31,845
Ain't that a pretty sight?

220
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,345
I bet they don't even lock their doors.

221
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:44,759
You won't notice a toy store
on the first level...

222
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:46,296
...but my suggestion is this:

223
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:50,527
Give the toy store six months free rent
to move up to the third level.

224
00:19:55,506 --> 00:19:59,909
When I go to the mall with my little boy,
we always visit the toy store.

225
00:20:00,478 --> 00:20:05,142
He knows he won't get anything unless
it's a special occasion, but like every kid...

226
00:20:05,216 --> 00:20:06,683
...he wants to look around...

227
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:09,311
Could you spare us the family anecdotes?

228
00:20:11,388 --> 00:20:14,186
There's always a lot of traffic in toy stores.

229
00:20:14,258 --> 00:20:17,853
If people have to go up to the third level
to visit the toy store...

230
00:20:17,928 --> 00:20:21,193
...then they have to go through
two other levels to get there.

231
00:20:21,265 --> 00:20:23,358
That's apparent to anyone with children.

232
00:20:23,434 --> 00:20:25,766
And you have to assume
that potential tenants...

233
00:20:25,836 --> 00:20:28,464
...might have kids and would know that...

234
00:20:28,572 --> 00:20:32,565
...and it might entice them
to take up space in the other levels.

235
00:20:34,178 --> 00:20:35,509
That's all I'm saying.

236
00:20:40,251 --> 00:20:43,186
We could have carried up a lot more stuff...

237
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:47,280
...if you didn't have to bring that idiotic doll
and all her junk!

238
00:20:47,358 --> 00:20:51,158
She's not idiotic!
She's an important training tool.

239
00:20:51,228 --> 00:20:55,460
You know why men are so lousy
when it comes to taking care of babies?

240
00:20:55,766 --> 00:20:57,996
They have better things to do.

241
00:20:58,135 --> 00:21:01,104
Like what? Play golf and drink beer?

242
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:06,041
No, like hunting, having wars, driving cars,
shaving, cleaning fish.

243
00:21:06,143 --> 00:21:07,576
Do you know how to do that?

244
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:08,737
Me?

245
00:21:09,046 --> 00:21:10,138
Margaret.

246
00:21:10,314 --> 00:21:11,076
Oh, okay.

247
00:21:11,148 --> 00:21:13,742
If you didn't have women,
you wouldn't have babies...

248
00:21:13,984 --> 00:21:15,975
...and you wouldn't have people.

249
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,322
If you didn't have men,
who'd drive the ladies to the hospital?

250
00:21:22,092 --> 00:21:27,052
Most important, they marry the women,
then the women can go and get the baby.

251
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:29,361
The baby is in her stomach!

252
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:34,498
She has to get it installed.
Her stomach isn't just filled up with babies.

253
00:21:34,572 --> 00:21:37,837
- Who installs them?
- A minister and a doctor.

254
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:39,407
- How?
- How?

255
00:21:40,377 --> 00:21:42,277
She wants to know how?

256
00:21:48,986 --> 00:21:50,851
Tell me, Dennis, how?

257
00:21:51,088 --> 00:21:52,953
The bellybutton. It opens up.

258
00:21:53,424 --> 00:21:57,918
- How come men have them?
- So they don't look weird in bathing suits.

259
00:21:59,697 --> 00:22:02,222
Okay, on the count of three...

260
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:04,128
...move your hand.

261
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:05,293
One.

262
00:22:07,805 --> 00:22:08,863
Two.

263
00:22:11,408 --> 00:22:12,568
Three!

264
00:22:17,748 --> 00:22:20,740
Okay, this time on the count of four.

265
00:22:21,652 --> 00:22:22,710
One.

266
00:22:23,687 --> 00:22:25,211
Two.

267
00:22:25,422 --> 00:22:26,582
Three.

268
00:22:27,157 --> 00:22:28,249
Four!

269
00:22:30,094 --> 00:22:33,825
Joey, you hold the hammer
and, Margaret, you hold the nail.

270
00:22:49,013 --> 00:22:50,844
We did a pretty good job.

271
00:22:50,915 --> 00:22:53,713
- How about a little paint?
- Couldn't hurt.

272
00:22:53,784 --> 00:22:56,116
- You got any?
- My dad does.

273
00:23:03,794 --> 00:23:07,059
- Give me my doll, you jerk!
- I don't have it!

274
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:11,325
- Give it to me! Dennis!
- I didn't take your doll.

275
00:23:11,402 --> 00:23:13,802
It's not here. Somebody took it.

276
00:23:13,938 --> 00:23:15,963
We've been with you.

277
00:23:20,811 --> 00:23:23,507
Do you guys swear you didn't take it?

278
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:24,739
Yep.

279
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:28,044
I've been robbed!

280
00:23:34,124 --> 00:23:39,027
You don't understand.
Baby Louise is a very expensive antique.

281
00:23:39,496 --> 00:23:41,555
Nobody robbed your doll.

282
00:23:41,732 --> 00:23:43,632
- Maybe a bear ate it.
- What?

283
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:46,834
Yeah, there's no robbers in our town.

284
00:24:42,893 --> 00:24:44,884
What are you eating there, sport?

285
00:24:46,363 --> 00:24:47,352
A apple.

286
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,166
Hi, Mr. Mitchell.

287
00:26:04,608 --> 00:26:06,473
Hello, Polly. Come on in.

288
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:09,875
- What's the helmet for?
- My girlfriend used to baby-sit for Dennis.

289
00:26:09,947 --> 00:26:12,609
She said to bring a helmet and wear pants.

290
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:52,446
I'm looking for Polly.

291
00:27:53,016 --> 00:27:54,506
You're Mickey?

292
00:27:54,851 --> 00:27:55,943
Yeah.

293
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,056
She's up in my mom's bathroom
using the armpit perfume.

294
00:28:00,123 --> 00:28:04,355
She says you're such a stud,
she gets nervous and sweats a lot.

295
00:28:05,495 --> 00:28:06,484
Cool.

296
00:28:07,097 --> 00:28:08,462
Come on in.

297
00:28:49,606 --> 00:28:51,073
Tastes funny.

298
00:28:58,215 --> 00:28:59,876
Tastes like paint.

299
00:29:02,886 --> 00:29:04,148
And wood.

300
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,820
I'll make us some sandwiches.

301
00:29:27,477 --> 00:29:30,173
'<i>'</i>'Do not cry, little locomotive,'...

302
00:29:30,247 --> 00:29:34,684
'<i>'...</i>said old Engine Number 99 to Huffy.

303
00:29:35,686 --> 00:29:39,383
'<i>'</i>'One day when you grow up,
you will realize...

304
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:42,448

305
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,655
'<i>'</i>'... even little mail trains."<i>'</i>

306
00:29:48,932 --> 00:29:50,524
How can a train grow?

307
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,763
He eats all his coal
and gets plenty of sleep.

308
00:29:54,638 --> 00:29:58,074
No, what's the point of reading lies?

309
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:02,174
It teaches kids to eat all their food...

310
00:30:02,245 --> 00:30:05,112
...and go to bed when they're supposed to.

311
00:30:05,282 --> 00:30:09,548
And not cry when mean cabooses
and boxcars make fun of them.

312
00:30:11,955 --> 00:30:13,422
This is so stupid.

313
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,425
Are you ready to get out of here
and go to bed, yet?

314
00:30:16,526 --> 00:30:19,984
I'm not even wrinkled up yet.
Keep reading.

315
00:30:25,235 --> 00:30:30,104
'<i>'</i>'I will never be big enough to pull anything

319
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:50,020
Where are you going?

320
00:30:58,869 --> 00:31:01,667
I'm going to investigate Mitchell's garage.

321
00:31:01,738 --> 00:31:05,572
Dennis has been fooling around with paint.
I know it, and I will prove it.

322
00:31:05,876 --> 00:31:08,970
Aren't you taking this a bit far, George?

323
00:31:09,846 --> 00:31:11,438
He's only a boy.

324
00:32:07,804 --> 00:32:08,896
Kids!

325
00:32:26,423 --> 00:32:28,118
G.D. Wading pool!

326
00:32:39,836 --> 00:32:41,167
That's it!

327
00:33:39,296 --> 00:33:42,288
Gee, I guess those kids took off.

328
00:33:58,481 --> 00:34:00,244
I got him this time.

329
00:34:00,717 --> 00:34:02,617
Mitchell can't deny it.

330
00:34:22,172 --> 00:34:23,764
Sorry. Good night.

331
00:34:30,714 --> 00:34:32,739
He's only a boy, huh?

332
00:35:12,722 --> 00:35:14,314
Hi, Mrs. Wilson.

333
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:17,456
Is Mr. Wilson up yet?

334
00:35:17,627 --> 00:35:19,117
Not yet, dear.

335
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:21,797
How long do you think he's going to sleep?

336
00:35:21,865 --> 00:35:25,096
Not too much longer.
He's having his picture taken this morning.

337
00:35:25,201 --> 00:35:28,898
- For what?
- He's being honored for his garden.

338
00:35:29,939 --> 00:35:33,102
Do you think he would get mad
if I went upstairs?

339
00:35:33,943 --> 00:35:36,411
What do you want to go upstairs for?

340
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:39,915
I made an '<i>'</i>I'm Sorry I Shot Paint
on Your Chicken'<i>'</i> card.

341
00:35:40,617 --> 00:35:42,608
That's very nice, Dennis.

342
00:35:42,986 --> 00:35:47,218
I'm kind of busy today,
so I won't have a chance to give it to him.

343
00:35:47,957 --> 00:35:50,084
I have to go to Margaret's house...

344
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,129
...because we're getting poor,
and my mom's got a job now.

345
00:35:53,196 --> 00:35:55,892
Could I leave it by his whisker cutter?

346
00:35:56,232 --> 00:35:58,700
That's where I leave
my dad's '<i>'</i>Sorry'<i>'</i> cards.

347
00:35:58,768 --> 00:36:01,498
And it's a good time to say you're sorry.

348
00:36:01,571 --> 00:36:04,404
Grownup guys are happy in the morning
when they wake up.

349
00:36:04,474 --> 00:36:05,668
My dad's so happy...

350
00:36:05,742 --> 00:36:08,006
...he whistles
when he goes to the bathroom.

351
00:36:08,111 --> 00:36:10,841
The only time he isn't happy
is on Sunday morning...

352
00:36:10,914 --> 00:36:12,506
...when he and my mom wrestle.

353
00:36:12,582 --> 00:36:14,607
They like to be alone when they do that.

354
00:36:14,684 --> 00:36:16,879
I think it's because they take off
their shirts.

355
00:36:16,953 --> 00:36:18,580
Then they start to make funny noises...

356
00:36:18,655 --> 00:36:19,747
You can go up...

357
00:36:19,823 --> 00:36:22,849
...as long as you promise
not to disturb Mr. Wilson.

358
00:36:22,926 --> 00:36:24,257
I promise.

359
00:36:29,065 --> 00:36:31,158
You know what, Mrs. Wilson?

360
00:36:31,534 --> 00:36:32,626
What?

361
00:36:32,702 --> 00:36:35,637
You're the nicest old gal on the block.

362
00:37:33,763 --> 00:37:34,752
Hello.

363
00:37:36,232 --> 00:37:37,995
My name is Dennis Mitchell.

364
00:37:39,936 --> 00:37:42,666
I'm the doctor. Open up and say<i>...</i>

365
00:38:17,974 --> 00:38:18,963
Hello.

366
00:38:27,116 --> 00:38:28,743
Mr. Wilson.

367
00:38:29,986 --> 00:38:32,181
George? Are you ready?

368
00:38:32,856 --> 00:38:34,847
The photographer's here.

369
00:38:37,994 --> 00:38:39,723
I got a 9:30, ma'am.

370
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:41,997
He'll be out any second.

371
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:44,291
Sorry.

372
00:38:48,538 --> 00:38:49,527
George?

373
00:38:56,145 --> 00:38:58,943
That looks fine, Martha. Leave it alone.

374
00:39:00,783 --> 00:39:03,616
Martha, step back. You're in the picture.

375
00:39:06,456 --> 00:39:07,787
Very good.

376
00:39:08,191 --> 00:39:09,419
Now...

377
00:39:09,692 --> 00:39:10,681
...smile.

378
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:05,206
Hey, you.

379
00:40:06,683 --> 00:40:08,674
Yeah, you. Come here.

380
00:40:16,426 --> 00:40:18,724
I haven't seen you around here before.

381
00:40:20,964 --> 00:40:23,660
Maybe because
I've never been around here.

382
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,233
What are you up to?

383
00:40:25,301 --> 00:40:26,928
What's it to you?

384
00:40:27,036 --> 00:40:28,025
Now, look.

385
00:40:28,771 --> 00:40:32,400
I run a nice, clean town here
and I don't want any trouble.

386
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:36,006
My advice to you
is just follow the sun out of here.

387
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,810
Only reason I ain't moving on because
you stopped to give me the breeze.

388
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:09,070
You have to go to two other levels
to get there and<i>...</i>

389
00:41:15,651 --> 00:41:17,585
Can I call you back?

390
00:41:20,757 --> 00:41:21,746
Hi, Mom.

391
00:41:22,492 --> 00:41:23,959
Good morning.

392
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:27,257
I hear you're trying to beg off
the Oklahoma City trip.

393
00:41:27,764 --> 00:41:29,755
I asked that it be rescheduled.

394
00:41:30,033 --> 00:41:32,661
Have a Cub Scout meeting or something?

395
00:41:32,835 --> 00:41:36,100
My husband has a trip
that was scheduled before mine.

396
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:41,306
If you two are traveling at the same time,
no one can watch your kid.

397
00:41:41,377 --> 00:41:42,708
Is that the problem?

398
00:41:42,779 --> 00:41:45,441
- It's not a problem, per se.
- Oh, good.

399
00:41:45,515 --> 00:41:49,645
Because if you want to blow off your trip,
I have to cover for you.

400
00:41:49,952 --> 00:41:52,284
And I have plans I can't break.

401
00:41:52,755 --> 00:41:54,723
I don't have kids but...

402
00:41:55,591 --> 00:41:57,218
...I do have a life.

403
00:41:58,661 --> 00:41:59,992
I'm sorry.

404
00:42:01,516 --> 00:42:03,643
I just won't be able to help you.

405
00:42:10,158 --> 00:42:11,216
God.

406
00:42:12,794 --> 00:42:14,887
- Okay.
- Who do we call first?

407
00:42:16,097 --> 00:42:18,190
Let's start with the A's.

408
00:42:18,366 --> 00:42:19,424
Vicki?

409
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,990
- You call.
- No, you call.

410
00:42:23,604 --> 00:42:24,434
Hello.

411
00:42:24,672 --> 00:42:28,130
Hi. This is Mrs. Mitchell.

412
00:42:34,415 --> 00:42:36,383
Hi. Alice Mitchell.

413
00:42:38,486 --> 00:42:39,748
Hi. Alice Mitchell.

414
00:42:40,488 --> 00:42:41,182
No.

415
00:42:44,959 --> 00:42:46,984
This is Henry Mitchell.

416
00:42:49,664 --> 00:42:51,723
This is Henry Mitchell.

417
00:43:07,215 --> 00:43:08,477
You call.

418
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:26,596
Hey, Mr. Wilson. I'm sleeping at your joint.

419
00:43:31,005 --> 00:43:34,668
- I brought you some grasshoppers.
- You shouldn't have.

420
00:43:34,942 --> 00:43:36,466
I'll take them, dear.

421
00:43:38,045 --> 00:43:41,173
Thank you so much, Martha. George.

422
00:43:41,482 --> 00:43:42,506
It's our pleasure.

423
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:45,984
- You saved our lives.
- Save two, lose one.

424
00:43:46,087 --> 00:43:48,180
I'll call you just as soon as I arrive.

425
00:43:48,256 --> 00:43:50,781
- Do you have our number?
- Don't worry about a thing.

426
00:43:52,527 --> 00:43:55,985
I brought my own pillow
so I don't get my spit on yours.

427
00:43:56,063 --> 00:43:57,655
Thank you, dear.

428
00:43:59,801 --> 00:44:01,598
Be a good boy, okay?

429
00:44:04,772 --> 00:44:08,071
Mind your manners
and listen to Mr. And Mrs. Wilson.

430
00:44:12,146 --> 00:44:13,613
- Thanks again.
- Thank you.

431
00:44:16,317 --> 00:44:17,477
Honey?

432
00:44:19,854 --> 00:44:20,843
Bye-bye.

433
00:44:20,922 --> 00:44:23,186
Bring me something good.

434
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:24,485
'Bye, sweetheart.

435
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:26,026
'Bye, Dennis.

436
00:44:27,061 --> 00:44:31,293
George, take Dennis' suitcase
up to the guest room, please.

437
00:44:31,766 --> 00:44:35,031
- He's got arms.
- Don't start, dear.

438
00:44:37,271 --> 00:44:40,240
You know why I'm not crying?

439
00:44:41,876 --> 00:44:44,367
Because if I can't be with my parents...

440
00:44:44,445 --> 00:44:47,141
...the person I want to be with is you.

441
00:44:50,284 --> 00:44:53,412
I can't tell you how deeply moved I am.

442
00:45:19,714 --> 00:45:21,341
Don't do that, please.

443
00:45:21,415 --> 00:45:22,211
What?

444
00:45:22,283 --> 00:45:23,477
The cord.

445
00:45:23,551 --> 00:45:25,212
Stop that tapping.

446
00:45:29,557 --> 00:45:33,254
There's not a lot to do around the house
when it's raining out.

447
00:45:35,897 --> 00:45:38,297
- Do you wanna play cards?
- No.

448
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:43,568
Want to put on your old Navy suit
and play war?

449
00:45:53,814 --> 00:45:56,214
- Is that pirates' gold?
- No.

450
00:45:57,051 --> 00:45:58,575
Is it real valuable?

451
00:45:59,287 --> 00:46:00,276
Yes.

452
00:46:01,255 --> 00:46:03,382
Is that why you keep it in your safe?

453
00:46:03,658 --> 00:46:04,647
Uh-huh.

454
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,287
How come your safe looks like books?

455
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:12,722
How come you ask so many questions?

456
00:46:13,301 --> 00:46:15,701
I've only been around for five years.

457
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:17,863
There's a lot of stuff I don't know.

458
00:46:21,809 --> 00:46:23,800
The safe looks like books...

459
00:46:24,245 --> 00:46:27,681
...so if a thief does come in,
he won't recognize it.

460
00:46:28,316 --> 00:46:30,546
- Is a thief a robber?
- Yes.

461
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:33,618
- Have you ever had a robber here?
- No.

462
00:46:34,488 --> 00:46:36,479
What's the combination to your lock?

463
00:46:38,259 --> 00:46:41,626
You're the last person in the world
I'd tell that to.

464
00:46:42,096 --> 00:46:44,223
You've got it wrote down someplace?

465
00:46:44,298 --> 00:46:45,697
It's in my head.

466
00:46:45,766 --> 00:46:49,497
- What's that mean?
- It means I know it. I remember it.

467
00:46:49,737 --> 00:46:53,400
- What if you forget it?
- I won't forget it. It's a familiar number.

468
00:46:53,474 --> 00:46:54,873
I won't forget it.

469
00:46:55,109 --> 00:46:56,736
What's that mean?

470
00:46:56,877 --> 00:47:01,405
It means it's a number
that I use all the time, so I won't forget it.

471
00:47:01,716 --> 00:47:03,581
I use it all the time.

472
00:47:04,218 --> 00:47:06,880
- I bet I know what it is.
- I doubt that.

473
00:47:07,188 --> 00:47:09,315
I bet it's your address.

474
00:47:10,257 --> 00:47:11,622
Know how I know?

475
00:47:11,692 --> 00:47:13,455
My friend has a bike lock...

476
00:47:13,527 --> 00:47:18,089
...and he uses his address
for the combination so he won't forget.

477
00:47:18,332 --> 00:47:20,459
- You're just as smart as him.
- He.

478
00:47:21,168 --> 00:47:24,365
You got everything figured out, don't you?

479
00:47:25,673 --> 00:47:30,167
I haven't figured out
how to get my work done...

480
00:47:30,244 --> 00:47:32,235
...with you in the house.

481
00:47:33,714 --> 00:47:35,443
That's a tough one.

482
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:54,960
Are you wrinkled enough yet, Dennis?

483
00:47:57,071 --> 00:47:59,801
- Yep.
- Want me to come help you out of the tub?

484
00:48:00,374 --> 00:48:02,808
Not unless you want to see
what the stork saw.

485
00:48:28,235 --> 00:48:29,327
Cool!

486
00:48:29,603 --> 00:48:31,127
Old Faithful.

487
00:49:38,739 --> 00:49:42,505
- How old is this bed?
- It belonged to my mother.

488
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:44,810
What's she sleeping on?

489
00:49:45,379 --> 00:49:47,472
She's been gone for many years, Dennis.

490
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:51,346
- On business?
- No.

491
00:49:52,253 --> 00:49:53,845
She's in heaven.

492
00:49:54,789 --> 00:49:57,587
There's an awful lot of people in heaven.

493
00:49:58,292 --> 00:50:00,157
Especially old people.

494
00:50:11,705 --> 00:50:15,801
How about if I recite my favorite poem
when I was your age?

495
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,640
- Is it about flowers and lambs?
- No.

496
00:50:19,513 --> 00:50:20,502
Okay.

497
00:50:23,184 --> 00:50:26,915

519
00:52:55,069 --> 00:52:58,095
Poor thing.
I wish he'd get that hernia fixed.

520
00:53:59,633 --> 00:54:01,624
George, are you sleeping?

521
00:54:03,137 --> 00:54:05,469
I was until you started yakking.

522
00:54:05,873 --> 00:54:07,204
I'm sorry.

523
00:54:09,676 --> 00:54:11,769
Was Dennis in our bathroom?

524
00:54:12,413 --> 00:54:13,402
Yes.

525
00:54:13,981 --> 00:54:18,441
I think the little rat
put mouthwash in my nasal spray...

526
00:54:19,053 --> 00:54:21,749
...and toilet cleanser in my mouthwash.

527
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:25,715
Why would he do something like that?

528
00:54:27,761 --> 00:54:29,228
Must you ask?

529
00:54:35,069 --> 00:54:36,229
Quiet!

530
00:54:38,238 --> 00:54:40,729
I recited a poem for Dennis tonight...

531
00:54:41,408 --> 00:54:44,104
...that my mother used to recite to me.

532
00:54:45,512 --> 00:54:47,480
I remembered every word.

533
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,850
In some tiny measure...

534
00:54:52,152 --> 00:54:56,145
...my mother would be proud
I passed something on.

535
00:54:57,024 --> 00:54:58,685
It's 10:00, Martha.

536
00:54:59,626 --> 00:55:01,821
Don't start with the regrets.

537
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,932
I would have been a good mother.

538
00:55:11,805 --> 00:55:14,433
And I would have made a swell fireman.

539
00:55:28,822 --> 00:55:32,280
- Where are you going?
- To make myself a cup of tea.

540
00:55:36,363 --> 00:55:39,423
I didn't decree
that we wouldn't have children.

541
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,298
That was out of both our hands.

542
00:55:44,037 --> 00:55:47,564
This isn't about having children
or not having children.

543
00:55:48,108 --> 00:55:49,632
You miss the point.

544
00:55:51,078 --> 00:55:52,545
It's about...

545
00:55:53,947 --> 00:55:56,541
...my feeling something very good...

546
00:55:57,284 --> 00:55:59,752
...and not being able to tell you about it.

547
00:56:40,661 --> 00:56:41,650
Martha?

548
00:56:47,801 --> 00:56:49,826
I didn't mean to hurt you.

549
00:56:50,604 --> 00:56:53,767
I'm not terribly good
with feelings and emotions.

550
00:56:54,975 --> 00:56:59,002
There are a lot of subjects
I'd just as soon not bring up or discuss.

551
00:56:59,913 --> 00:57:02,848
I would have liked a son or a daughter.

552
00:57:04,384 --> 00:57:07,478
You couldn't fire the fatherly feelings
in me...

553
00:57:08,455 --> 00:57:10,047
...because they're not there.

554
00:57:11,058 --> 00:57:14,425
But that doesn't mean my feelings for you
have gone cold.

555
00:57:14,494 --> 00:57:16,291
That'll never happen.

556
00:57:17,397 --> 00:57:19,695
You've got all the love I have.

557
00:57:22,069 --> 00:57:23,559
Remember this?

558
00:57:24,404 --> 00:57:28,465
<i>Je t'aime. Je t'adore. Ma petite chérie.</i>

559
00:57:37,584 --> 00:57:38,573
George.

560
00:57:52,432 --> 00:57:54,127
Get out of here!

561
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,070
What are you looking for now?

562
00:58:02,743 --> 00:58:04,335
Garden lanterns.

563
00:58:05,279 --> 00:58:09,773
You must be pretty brave to ride
on a tiger in your underpants.

564
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:12,414
Put that away. That's not for kids!

565
00:59:12,979 --> 00:59:13,968
Martha.

566
00:59:14,448 --> 00:59:16,939
Where are the G.D. Garden lanterns?

567
00:59:43,944 --> 00:59:46,242
I think I better go outside and play.

568
01:00:06,333 --> 01:00:07,322
Hello.

569
01:00:08,168 --> 01:00:09,192
Hello, Martha.

570
01:00:09,936 --> 01:00:11,301
It's Alice.

571
01:00:11,438 --> 01:00:12,871
I'm still in Oklahoma.

572
01:00:13,273 --> 01:00:14,535
Oh, dear.

573
01:00:14,808 --> 01:00:17,038
<i>Yes, there's a terrible storm.</i>

574
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:18,372
<i>My flight's been cancelled.</i>

575
01:00:18,979 --> 01:00:22,176
Till the weather clears,
I don't know what's going to happen.

576
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:26,610
<i>I know your garden party's tonight.</i>
<i>I feel terrible.</i>

577
01:00:26,686 --> 01:00:28,984
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

578
01:00:29,389 --> 01:00:32,722
Don't worry about it.
You get home when you can.

579
01:00:33,393 --> 01:00:35,190
We'll be just fine here.

580
01:00:35,796 --> 01:00:37,889
What's George going to say?

581
01:00:39,866 --> 01:00:42,300
Over my dead body!

582
01:00:42,636 --> 01:00:47,369
This is my crowning moment of retired life
and I won't throw it away like the trash...

583
01:00:47,441 --> 01:00:51,036
...for a ninny who can't get her keister
to the airport on time.

584
01:00:51,111 --> 01:00:54,080
George Wilson,
you have no right to insult Alice.

585
01:00:54,147 --> 01:00:57,173
She can't help the weather,
any more than you or I.

586
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:58,842
It's just plain bad luck.

587
01:00:58,919 --> 01:01:00,648
It's no one's fault.

588
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:04,451
A tragedy of this magnitude
has to be somebody's fault.

589
01:01:04,524 --> 01:01:06,253
It isn't a tragedy.

590
01:01:06,426 --> 01:01:09,122
A little boy's going to join us for a party.

591
01:01:09,896 --> 01:01:14,230
If you want to forsake your neighbors
when they need help, do it alone.

592
01:01:16,036 --> 01:01:19,199
Why is it, when everyone else
feasts on the pleasures of life...

593
01:01:19,272 --> 01:01:20,637
...I get the indigestion?

594
01:01:20,707 --> 01:01:22,834
Because you're an old grump.

595
01:01:39,759 --> 01:01:42,023
We did a pretty good job.

596
01:01:42,562 --> 01:01:43,995
Uh-huh.

597
01:01:44,531 --> 01:01:47,625
Now we can order furniture
and major appliances.

598
01:02:38,618 --> 01:02:40,210
Well, Dennis...

599
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,754
<i>...</i>your mother did not arrive.
- Nope.

600
01:02:43,823 --> 01:02:46,257
This is an important event for me.

601
01:02:46,526 --> 01:02:47,720
I know.

602
01:02:47,861 --> 01:02:49,556
I don't want any nonsense.

603
01:02:49,629 --> 01:02:53,087
You mind whatever manners you have
and don't be a pest.

604
01:02:53,166 --> 01:02:54,155
Okay.

605
01:02:54,234 --> 01:02:55,997
Don't embarrass me.

606
01:02:56,102 --> 01:02:57,091
Okay.

607
01:02:59,272 --> 01:03:00,796
Cheek pinchers.

608
01:03:05,245 --> 01:03:07,372
Look at the cute little boy.

609
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:12,477
Are you our little host?

610
01:03:12,686 --> 01:03:15,416
The party's in the back.

611
01:03:16,222 --> 01:03:19,089
Ladies, girls, the party's in the back.

612
01:03:19,159 --> 01:03:22,720
Thank you very much.
It's just this way, thank you.

613
01:03:23,296 --> 01:03:25,025
Don't embarrass me.

614
01:03:29,803 --> 01:03:31,236
Attention, everyone.

615
01:03:31,304 --> 01:03:33,135
Gather over here, please.

616
01:03:33,206 --> 01:03:36,573
Have a seat.
It's time to begin the ceremony.

617
01:03:37,043 --> 01:03:39,375
All right, members, don't be timid.

618
01:03:39,446 --> 01:03:41,846
Move down front. Plenty of seats.

619
01:03:41,982 --> 01:03:43,973
Either side, either side.

'<i>'</i>Plague.'<i>'</i> What does that mean?

628
01:04:14,447 --> 01:04:16,881
Thank you, everyone. I am honored.

629
01:04:17,517 --> 01:04:19,678
I will cherish this forever.

630
01:04:21,054 --> 01:04:22,612
Forty years ago...

631
01:04:22,856 --> 01:04:26,087
...when I started this garden,
I planted a seed.

632
01:04:27,594 --> 01:04:29,687
From that tiny seed...

633
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:32,721
...grew this grand plant.

634
01:04:35,035 --> 01:04:36,229
Tonight...

635
01:04:36,302 --> 01:04:40,796
...for the first and only time
in its entire life, it will blossom.

636
01:04:42,008 --> 01:04:43,908
As we await this glorious moment...

637
01:04:43,977 --> 01:04:47,538
...Martha and I invite you
to have some desert and coffee.

638
01:04:50,517 --> 01:04:52,246
Congratulations.

639
01:05:03,863 --> 01:05:06,229
George, would you bring the coffee?

640
01:05:15,542 --> 01:05:17,806
George, don't start, George.

641
01:05:19,779 --> 01:05:23,044
Could you get somebody
to come and clear this away?

642
01:05:26,286 --> 01:05:27,913
I made a mistake.

643
01:07:22,702 --> 01:07:24,294
Mr. Wilson!

644
01:07:25,205 --> 01:07:27,298
Somebody robbed your house.

645
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:53,194
Forty years down the drain.

646
01:08:09,315 --> 01:08:11,283
You're a pest.

647
01:08:11,351 --> 01:08:12,613
A menace.

648
01:08:12,919 --> 01:08:16,446
A selfish, spoiled little boy
and I have no use for you.

649
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:20,884
You took something from me
that I can never get back.

650
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,690
Something that means more to me
than you ever will.

651
01:08:23,997 --> 01:08:25,521
You understand?

652
01:08:26,599 --> 01:08:29,227
I don't want to see you.
I don't want to know you.

653
01:08:30,904 --> 01:08:32,565
Get out of my way.

654
01:08:36,142 --> 01:08:38,167
I'm sorry, Mr. Wilson.

655
01:08:39,879 --> 01:08:42,814
Party's over, everybody. Go on home.

656
01:08:42,882 --> 01:08:44,213
I'm sorry.

657
01:09:29,796 --> 01:09:31,696
Oh, my God!

658
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:35,597
Where's Dennis?

659
01:10:20,179 --> 01:10:22,443
Joey hasn't seen him all night?

660
01:10:24,217 --> 01:10:25,309
Okay.

661
01:10:25,385 --> 01:10:27,979
Well, if he shows up, please call me.

662
01:10:28,554 --> 01:10:29,543
'Bye.

663
01:10:37,296 --> 01:10:39,787
- Did you call the Wades?
- Yes.

664
01:10:39,999 --> 01:10:42,797
But that's the last place he'd go.

665
01:10:49,475 --> 01:10:52,000
<i>Don't you ever come back here again.</i>

666
01:10:52,845 --> 01:10:54,335
<i>He's a menace.</i>

667
01:10:55,681 --> 01:10:57,171
<i>Turn that off!</i>

668
01:10:57,950 --> 01:11:01,317
<i>Don't make a pest of yourself</i>
<i>and don't embarrass me.</i>

669
01:11:02,789 --> 01:11:06,247
<i>I don't want to know you.</i>
<i>I don't want to see you.</i>

670
01:11:06,359 --> 01:11:08,088
<i>Get out of my way.</i>

671
01:11:21,841 --> 01:11:24,036
These woods are pretty scary at night.

672
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:26,510
I'm sure glad I ran into a grownup.

673
01:11:26,679 --> 01:11:28,670
It'll work out real nice.

674
01:11:29,048 --> 01:11:31,710
- You can be my hostage.
- Cool!

675
01:11:33,319 --> 01:11:35,913
I can only be your hostage till tomorrow.

676
01:11:36,355 --> 01:11:38,346
I have church in the morning.

677
01:11:40,393 --> 01:11:42,418
You ain't going to church.

678
01:11:42,962 --> 01:11:46,193
You and me are catching the midnight train
out of here.

679
01:11:46,265 --> 01:11:47,254
Really?

680
01:11:47,834 --> 01:11:51,497
We better stop at my house first.
I have to tell my mom and dad...

681
01:11:51,571 --> 01:11:52,731
...or else they'll worry.

682
01:11:52,805 --> 01:11:55,865
And I must get clean underwear
and my camera...

683
01:11:56,275 --> 01:11:59,073
...and tell my parents to feed my fish...

684
01:11:59,178 --> 01:12:00,543
...some sun block...

685
01:12:00,613 --> 01:12:04,982
...and vitamins and stuff to play with
on the train so I don't get bored.

686
01:12:05,051 --> 01:12:07,383
Put a cork in it.
You're giving me a headache.

687
01:12:07,453 --> 01:12:08,477
I don't have a cork.

688
01:12:08,554 --> 01:12:10,146
Shut your mouth!

689
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:13,391
I can't because my nose is stuffy
because of my allergies.

690
01:12:13,459 --> 01:12:15,324
If I shut my mouth, I can't breathe good.

691
01:12:15,394 --> 01:12:18,227
Then keep your mouth open, but don't talk!

692
01:12:20,299 --> 01:12:23,598
Where do you put the cork
when you put a cork in it?

693
01:12:24,504 --> 01:12:26,438
Didn't I ask you to shut your yap?

694
01:12:26,506 --> 01:12:28,633
What's a yap?

695
01:12:29,675 --> 01:12:30,903
It's your mouth.

696
01:12:30,977 --> 01:12:33,810
I can't shut my mouth
because my nose is stuffy.

697
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,108
Shut up!

698
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:46,781
I have one more question.

699
01:12:48,561 --> 01:12:49,653
What?

700
01:12:50,163 --> 01:12:52,461
What does a hostage have to do?

701
01:12:52,899 --> 01:12:54,025
Nothing.

702
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:55,397
How come you need one?

703
01:12:56,302 --> 01:12:58,566
In case the cops show up.

704
01:12:59,105 --> 01:13:00,595
Do I get to use a gun?

705
01:13:00,673 --> 01:13:04,109
You get to stand in front of me
if the cops use a gun.

706
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:08,276
I've got a slingshot.

707
01:13:09,315 --> 01:13:10,373
Swell.

708
01:13:10,449 --> 01:13:12,644
I'm a good shot. Want to see?

709
01:13:14,887 --> 01:13:18,345
Excuse me, mister. Do you want to see?

710
01:13:19,725 --> 01:13:22,353
Mister, can you watch me for a minute?

711
01:13:25,631 --> 01:13:27,724
I'll tell you when to look.

712
01:13:36,842 --> 01:13:38,002
Look!

713
01:13:42,315 --> 01:13:44,510
Your fire's getting puny.

714
01:13:46,419 --> 01:13:50,753
When my dad's fire gets puny,
he wiggles it around and it gets bigger.

715
01:14:36,869 --> 01:14:37,893
Dennis!

716
01:14:49,248 --> 01:14:50,545
Dennis!

717
01:14:53,552 --> 01:14:56,851
I'm sorry
you're not having a very fun camping trip.

718
01:14:58,491 --> 01:15:01,858
Nobody shoots a marble at my head...

719
01:15:01,927 --> 01:15:03,861
...and sets my pants on fire.

720
01:15:04,263 --> 01:15:05,628
That was an accident.

721
01:15:05,698 --> 01:15:08,531
There ain't going to be no more accidents!

722
01:15:09,201 --> 01:15:10,600
Turn around!

723
01:15:21,814 --> 01:15:23,679
You're doing it wrong.

724
01:15:23,816 --> 01:15:25,078
Get lost.

725
01:15:25,618 --> 01:15:28,052
I tied up lots of guys in my life.

726
01:15:28,287 --> 01:15:31,745
I bet you've never tied up a 5-year-old.
I'll just get out.

727
01:15:31,824 --> 01:15:34,793
I'll tie it so tight
you won't be able to move.

728
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:38,159
The rope's too big and my legs are
too small to make it tight enough.

729
01:15:38,798 --> 01:15:40,993
There's only one way to do it
and I know because...

730
01:15:41,067 --> 01:15:44,002
...many people have tried to tie me up
but it doesn't work.

731
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:45,401
But you try your way.

732
01:15:45,471 --> 01:15:48,235
I'll get out
and you'll just have to keep doing it.

733
01:15:56,315 --> 01:15:57,839
What do you do differently?

734
01:16:02,955 --> 01:16:06,584
First, you must tie up each leg by itself.

735
01:16:07,059 --> 01:16:09,152
Then you tie them together.

736
01:16:26,512 --> 01:16:29,777
No matter how much I wiggle,
I can't ever get out.

737
01:16:31,851 --> 01:16:34,547
If you really don't want me to move at all<i>...</i>

738
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:42,891
Bend down.

739
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,695
You can't get out of that at all, right?

740
01:16:54,173 --> 01:16:55,003
Nope.

741
01:16:55,074 --> 01:16:59,670
You tie me up like that, no matter
how much I try, I can't ever get out.

742
01:16:59,945 --> 01:17:00,934
Thanks.

743
01:17:02,481 --> 01:17:04,642
- Now let me loose.
- Okay.

744
01:17:04,984 --> 01:17:06,315
Get the handcuff key.

745
01:17:06,385 --> 01:17:08,512
- Where is it?
- On my bag.

746
01:17:33,078 --> 01:17:34,170
What?

747
01:17:38,484 --> 01:17:39,678
Dennis!

748
01:17:43,589 --> 01:17:44,681
Dennis!

749
01:17:56,702 --> 01:17:58,192
I'm going to kill you.

750
01:17:58,270 --> 01:18:00,568
How? You can't move. Open up.

751
01:18:01,073 --> 01:18:02,597
I ain't hungry!

752
01:18:02,908 --> 01:18:05,308
It's the only way to get the key.

753
01:18:05,444 --> 01:18:07,241
You can't waste food.

754
01:18:07,413 --> 01:18:09,711
Plus, you must eat your dinner.

755
01:18:12,718 --> 01:18:13,946
Come on.

756
01:18:14,286 --> 01:18:15,685
Come on.

757
01:18:18,257 --> 01:18:19,747
It's coming.

758
01:18:28,767 --> 01:18:29,995
Too hot?

759
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:50,315
You must have swallowed it.

760
01:18:53,659 --> 01:18:55,627
I swallowed my allowance once.

761
01:18:55,694 --> 01:18:59,061
I had to wait a whole night and a day
to get it back.

762
01:19:10,009 --> 01:19:10,998
Dennis!

763
01:20:02,227 --> 01:20:04,627
Firewood. Bombs away!

764
01:20:22,047 --> 01:20:24,072
Poor little lamb.

765
01:20:24,383 --> 01:20:26,749
He must be exhausted.

766
01:20:26,819 --> 01:20:30,983
I better cover him up
so he doesn't catch his death of cold.

767
01:21:20,039 --> 01:21:21,472
There we go.

768
01:21:50,269 --> 01:21:52,294
What's he got a purse for?

769
01:21:58,711 --> 01:22:00,110
Holy smokes!

770
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:01,810
He's rich!

771
01:22:16,528 --> 01:22:18,052
Don't worry, I got it!

772
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:20,428
I got it! I got it!

773
01:23:05,744 --> 01:23:07,211
Dennis!

774
01:23:09,882 --> 01:23:12,407
I've lost the only man I ever loved.

775
01:23:24,129 --> 01:23:25,960
I'll get you out of there.

776
01:23:26,031 --> 01:23:29,933
You shouldn't jump in a river
with handcuffs on, for God's sake!

777
01:23:30,836 --> 01:23:32,428
You could drown.

778
01:23:40,779 --> 01:23:42,804
Hold on. I'm coming.

779
01:23:46,752 --> 01:23:48,151
Hey, mister!

780
01:23:49,421 --> 01:23:52,447
Good thing I know a lot about ropes, huh?

781
01:23:57,596 --> 01:23:59,086
That's my boy!

782
01:23:59,198 --> 01:24:01,860
Mr. Wilson taught me how to tie knots.

783
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,959
When I get you out, I'm going to bed.
I'm beat.

784
01:24:06,905 --> 01:24:09,032
It must be all the fresh air.

785
01:24:12,311 --> 01:24:14,074
Hold on, I'm coming.

786
01:24:23,789 --> 01:24:27,623
There you go. Now just pull yourself in.

787
01:25:15,974 --> 01:25:17,999
This is Mr. Wilson's gold.

788
01:25:19,278 --> 01:25:21,974
- How come you got it?
- I stole it.

789
01:25:22,481 --> 01:25:23,846
You're a robber?

790
01:25:23,916 --> 01:25:25,076
I'm a thief.

791
01:25:27,452 --> 01:25:29,852
Say your prayers, little rat!

792
01:25:29,988 --> 01:25:32,388
I can't. I didn't take my bath yet.

793
01:25:32,457 --> 01:25:34,288
Have it your own way.

794
01:27:48,126 --> 01:27:49,115
Martha!

795
01:27:49,428 --> 01:27:50,417
Mitchell!

796
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:04,372
Hey, Mr. Wilson!

797
01:28:23,528 --> 01:28:25,086
- Guess what?
- What?

798
01:28:26,998 --> 01:28:28,795
I got your gold back.

799
01:28:30,669 --> 01:28:31,658
Dennis!

800
01:28:34,706 --> 01:28:36,697
Mom! Dad!

801
01:28:37,976 --> 01:28:41,707
Oh, sweetheart! Thank God, you're okay.

802
01:28:54,526 --> 01:28:55,720
Help.

803
01:29:15,347 --> 01:29:18,339
This is my buddy. This is my pal.

804
01:29:29,461 --> 01:29:30,450
Wait a minute.

805
01:29:30,562 --> 01:29:34,692
You can tell everybody at the big house
you met our Dennis Mitchell.

806
01:29:37,302 --> 01:29:39,065
All right. Let's wrap it up.

807
01:29:43,108 --> 01:29:44,097
Mister.

808
01:29:45,877 --> 01:29:47,811
You forgot something.

809
01:29:52,918 --> 01:29:53,907
Dennis!

810
01:30:19,744 --> 01:30:22,042
I like that rhubarb pie that Martha makes.

811
01:30:22,113 --> 01:30:24,843
- Wonderful dinner.
- Thank you, Henry.

812
01:30:25,283 --> 01:30:27,012
Alice, your coffee.

813
01:30:29,921 --> 01:30:31,047
Guess what?

814
01:30:31,122 --> 01:30:32,851
I won't have to travel anymore.

815
01:30:32,924 --> 01:30:34,323
That's nice.

816
01:30:34,526 --> 01:30:36,824
They want me to work on the project here.

817
01:30:36,895 --> 01:30:40,490
They agreed to start a daycare center
so I can take Dennis with me to work.

818
01:30:40,565 --> 01:30:42,226
That's ridiculous!

819
01:30:42,867 --> 01:30:45,301
What the heck's he going to do all day?

820
01:30:45,370 --> 01:30:46,997
Don't be foolish.

821
01:30:47,105 --> 01:30:50,165
We're right next door. We can watch him.

822
01:30:51,476 --> 01:30:53,706
Well, of course. We'd love to.

823
01:30:53,778 --> 01:30:56,076
I don't think<i>...</i>

824
01:30:56,248 --> 01:31:00,685
I mean, you must remember back
to all the times Dennis upset you.

825
01:31:01,353 --> 01:31:04,686
This is a new ball game.
I've learned a few things.

826
01:31:04,756 --> 01:31:05,950
Kids are kids.

827
01:31:07,058 --> 01:31:09,356
You have to play by their rules.

828
01:31:09,728 --> 01:31:12,253
If you can't do that, you're in trouble.

829
01:31:12,330 --> 01:31:14,389
You must roll with the punches.

830
01:31:14,466 --> 01:31:16,764
You must expect the unexpected.

831
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:45,689
Aren't you supposed to be
in the daycare area with the other children?

832
01:31:46,831 --> 01:31:49,061
That's where I was, but I had to leave.

833
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:51,191
The lady who watches the kids said...

834
01:31:51,269 --> 01:31:54,363
...if she had to look at me
for five more seconds...

835
01:31:54,439 --> 01:31:57,237
...she'd jump out the window.

836
01:31:58,209 --> 01:31:59,972
She's a pretty nice lady...

837
01:32:00,178 --> 01:32:02,169
...so I wouldn't want her to do that.

838
01:32:05,216 --> 01:32:07,013
Can I push the button?

839
01:32:07,085 --> 01:32:09,781
No, because you don't know
which button to push.

840
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:24,295
It's this one!

841
01:32:34,379 --> 01:32:36,540
I'm going to get this little kid!
