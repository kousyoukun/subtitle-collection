1
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,907
Hey, Mr. Wilson!

2
00:03:31,748 --> 00:03:32,907
Mr. Wilson.

3
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,514
Mr. Wilson?

4
00:03:38,882 --> 00:03:40,246
Mr. Wilson?

5
00:03:47,782 --> 00:03:50,441
Poor old Mr. Wilson must be so sick.

6
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,779
No wonder he ain't up.

7
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,176
Wow!

8
00:04:04,017 --> 00:04:06,949
His heart sounds like our washing machine!

9
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:15,008
Oh, no.

10
00:04:15,217 --> 00:04:17,445
He's growing extra skin.

11
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:44,208
His tongue's very ugly...

12
00:04:45,086 --> 00:04:46,984
...and blue and spotty.

13
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,410
Cool!

14
00:04:58,353 --> 00:04:59,944
He feels warm.

15
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:02,248
He has a temperature.

16
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,615
I know what you need.

17
00:05:05,153 --> 00:05:06,550
You need an aspirin.

18
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:31,045
Don't you ever come back!
Do you hear me?

19
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,316
Never!

20
00:06:33,224 --> 00:06:36,248
Starting part time will give you a chance
to ease back into it.

21
00:06:36,324 --> 00:06:39,314
I mean, managing shopping malls
can't be much more difficult...

22
00:06:39,392 --> 00:06:40,982
...than managing Dennis.

23
00:06:41,725 --> 00:06:43,385
Where have you been?

24
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:44,946
Dennis?

25
00:06:46,225 --> 00:06:47,213
Dennis?

26
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,083
I was at Mr. Wilson's house.

27
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:52,354
And, boy, is he sick.

28
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:55,218
He's got a fever, and he's burning up.

29
00:06:55,692 --> 00:06:57,318
I better call Martha.

30
00:06:57,392 --> 00:06:59,950
You didn't bother him, did you?

31
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:02,417
No, but I gave him an aspirin.

32
00:07:02,493 --> 00:07:05,323
And he don't like them any better than me.

33
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:09,426
You shouldn't visit people
so early in the morning.

34
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:12,721
That's the only time I know for sure
they'll be home.

35
00:07:12,793 --> 00:07:14,520
Hello, George. Alice Mitchell.

36
00:07:14,593 --> 00:07:16,752
Are you feeling all right?
Dennis said that you...

37
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:17,793
<i>Feeling all right!</i>

38
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,020
<i>Your son just shot an aspirin
down my throat with a slingshot!</i>

39
00:07:22,094 --> 00:07:23,492
I'm very sorry.

40
00:07:23,561 --> 00:07:24,924
<i>You better talk to him!</i>

41
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:26,324
We'll talk to him.

42
00:07:26,394 --> 00:07:29,224
<i>When I was a child,
none of this would have been tolerated!</i>

43
00:07:29,528 --> 00:07:31,051
Bye. Bye.

44
00:07:38,628 --> 00:07:39,652
Hi.

45
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:43,828
Did you shoot an aspirin
into Mr. Wilson's mouth?

46
00:07:43,895 --> 00:07:47,350
I didn't want him to bite off my fingers
with his big, fake teeth.

47
00:07:47,428 --> 00:07:49,326
Those things are sharp!

48
00:07:50,462 --> 00:07:53,860
George said Dennis shot an aspirin
into his mouth with a slingshot.

49
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:55,088
What slingshot?

50
00:07:55,162 --> 00:07:57,025
- Do you have a slingshot?
- I'm not sure.

51
00:07:57,096 --> 00:07:58,426
Give it to me.

52
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,962
Mr. Wilson is very angry with you.

53
00:08:06,396 --> 00:08:08,954
I thought he was sick.
I was only trying to help.

54
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,061
You go sit in the corner
and think about what you've done.

55
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,228
- For how long?
- Until you're sorry.

56
00:08:14,297 --> 00:08:15,785
Oh, good. I'm sorry now.

57
00:08:16,364 --> 00:08:17,455
He can't sit in the corner.

58
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:20,326
I have to take him
to Margaret Wade's house.

59
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:22,895
Margaret's house!

60
00:08:22,964 --> 00:08:26,259
I didn't do anything bad enough
to deserve to go to her house.

61
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,161
She's a lunatic. I'll go crazy.
She tortures me.

62
00:08:29,231 --> 00:08:32,061
She's mean. She's ugly.
She doesn't share!

63
00:08:33,064 --> 00:08:37,554
I arranged with Mrs. Wade for you
to go to their house while I work.

64
00:08:38,565 --> 00:08:39,928
Are you serious?

65
00:08:39,998 --> 00:08:42,863
You can't spend the summer unsupervised.
You're out of school.

66
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:44,227
I'll go back.

67
00:08:44,298 --> 00:08:48,322
Your mother made arrangements.
That's it! I don't want any arguments.

68
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,455
My life is falling apart.

69
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:05,493
Hello, George.

70
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,332
Let me take that off your hands. Sorry.

71
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,288
<i>I'm...</i>

72
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,559
I'm sorry about this morning.

73
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,393
I won't mince words, Mitchell.

74
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,291
Your kid is driving me nuts.

75
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:27,933
- I'll talk to him again.
- Maybe it isn't talk that he needs.

76
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:31,865
When my dad had something important
to tell me, he told me with his belt.

77
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:34,366
That's not how I deal with my son,
Mr. Wilson.

78
00:09:34,601 --> 00:09:35,794
However you deal with him...

79
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:40,459
...he hasn't learned you don't shoot
an aspirin down a fellow's throat!

80
00:09:40,601 --> 00:09:43,829
- Mr. Wilson, he's five.
- When I was five, I had some respect.

81
00:09:43,902 --> 00:09:46,800
You were probably an exceptional boy.

82
00:09:46,868 --> 00:09:50,665
In 1925, I was not the exception,
I was the rule.

83
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:53,065
I'll make sure
Dennis doesn't come by anymore.

84
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:54,964
Careful how you say it.

85
00:09:55,035 --> 00:09:58,399
I don't want everybody to think
I'm a child-hater or an ogre.

86
00:09:58,903 --> 00:10:01,698
I'm a reasonable man
who expects reasonable treatment...

87
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,762
...from his neighbors and their children.

88
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,439
I was with the post office
for more than 43 years, and never once...

89
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:08,641
I'm running a little late.

90
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:11,654
I'll come by after work
and we can continue the conversation.

91
00:10:11,722 --> 00:10:15,183
There's nothing to continue.
I've said my piece. We'll leave it at that.

92
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:18,599
The boy cannot come over here
unless he behaves himself.

93
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,104
He won't be over at all.

94
00:10:20,172 --> 00:10:24,203
Now don't make me out to be a grump.
I didn't say <i>"never."</i> I said...

95
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,147
I really have to go.

96
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:29,022
<i>Well, now, don't...</i>

97
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:33,723
Have a good day.

98
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,167
He's out of school now.

99
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:38,731
He can't spend all his free time here.

100
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,440
I'm not the bad guy in this, Mitchell.

101
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:43,074
I'm the victim!

102
00:10:44,354 --> 00:10:46,951
George, who were you shouting at?

103
00:10:47,594 --> 00:10:50,998
Mitchell, and I wasn't shouting.
I was making my point.

104
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:54,604
It's not right that his youngster
can run wild doing as he pleases...

105
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:57,407
...without regard to people or property.

106
00:10:57,513 --> 00:10:59,483
He's only a boy, George.

107
00:10:59,652 --> 00:11:01,553
He'll knot my rope once too often.

108
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:04,457
I can't stand that kid! He's a menace!

109
00:11:04,828 --> 00:11:09,235
You'd better come in and have breakfast.
We're due at the Garden Club at 9:00.

110
00:11:10,005 --> 00:11:14,446
Today is an important day for me, and
I'm already in a lather because of that kid.

111
00:11:14,514 --> 00:11:17,851
I don't know if I'll even be able
to enjoy my moment of triumph.

112
00:11:17,921 --> 00:11:19,891
Don't get your hopes up.

113
00:11:20,225 --> 00:11:23,561
There are lots of other gardens in town
just as nice as yours.

114
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:25,499
Please! I'm a shoe-in.

115
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:32,280
Who else has a night-blooming mock orchid
flowering this year?

116
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,616
It's an awfully homely looking plant.

117
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:38,792
Hang the looks of the thing!

118
00:11:38,862 --> 00:11:41,766
It opens before your eyes
in the light of the full moon.

119
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,395
It's a marvel, Martha.

120
00:11:43,472 --> 00:11:45,908
Forty years to mature and blossom.

121
00:11:46,211 --> 00:11:49,342
The flower opens and withers
in a matter of moments.

122
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,082
There isn't a gardener in town
with a plant that requires...

123
00:11:52,156 --> 00:11:55,822
...a 40-year investment
for 10 seconds of splendor.

124
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:11,258
How do you feel about me working?

125
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,463
A lot of moms work.

126
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:20,409
The best I could do finding someone
to watch you is Mrs. Wade.

127
00:12:22,683 --> 00:12:25,849
What about Joey?
Did you think about him?

128
00:12:25,956 --> 00:12:29,487
What if he comes over?
He'll think I moved.

129
00:12:29,597 --> 00:12:33,001
Joey's mother made plans
with Mrs. Wade just like I did.

130
00:12:33,237 --> 00:12:35,333
Joey's at Margaret's house.

131
00:12:43,592 --> 00:12:44,753
Do it!

132
00:12:46,296 --> 00:12:48,767
- I can make you.
- How?

133
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:52,034
I'll slug you back.

134
00:12:52,108 --> 00:12:54,909
- You can't hit a girl.
- I can too.

135
00:12:55,248 --> 00:12:58,414
Try it. I'll scream
so awfully, bloody, deadly horrible...

136
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:00,481
...my mom'll think you tried to murder me.

137
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:05,500
I'll say you did and she'll believe it.
Because boys are like that and girls aren't.

138
00:13:05,736 --> 00:13:07,136
That really stinks.

139
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:08,173
Quit wasting time.

140
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,440
Mush your lips together
and let's get this over with.

141
00:13:15,956 --> 00:13:17,549
Close your eyes!

142
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:25,434
Kiss me.

143
00:13:32,522 --> 00:13:34,321
All right. Let's go.

144
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:36,293
Dennis, come on.

145
00:13:36,596 --> 00:13:37,860
Oh, gosh.

146
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:39,732
Acting like a baby.

147
00:13:41,808 --> 00:13:42,798
Get up!

148
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:45,776
Right this instant!

149
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,913
Don't you dare embarrass me!

150
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:52,924
Fine, I'll drag you inside.

151
00:13:57,438 --> 00:14:00,638
You guys are the boring ones.
There's lots to do.

152
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:03,046
Oh, really? Like what?

153
00:14:03,317 --> 00:14:05,253
We could practice singing songs.

154
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:06,687
Or put on a play...

155
00:14:06,757 --> 00:14:08,454
...or a puppet show.

156
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:12,160
- We could bury you alive.
- I could pound your face.

157
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:14,764
It doesn't matter, anyways, Margaret.

158
00:14:15,307 --> 00:14:18,211
We'll be leaving soon
and we have work to do.

159
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,216
We're going to make a fort.

160
00:14:20,885 --> 00:14:24,052
You can't leave unless I go with you,
or I'll tell on you.

161
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,425
So, tough kitty paws, I'm going.

162
00:14:26,663 --> 00:14:29,726
Climb down from there. I'll get my purse.

163
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:07,436
This thing's been here our whole life
and we never knew it.

164
00:15:07,512 --> 00:15:11,212
- Do you think anybody lives in it?
- Just squirrels and birds.

165
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,187
It looks kind of junky.

166
00:15:13,423 --> 00:15:14,823
We'll fix it up.

167
00:15:15,126 --> 00:15:17,221
Good. I'll be the decorator.

168
00:15:17,297 --> 00:15:21,568
We'll put on a special room for the babies
and a powder room for guests.

169
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,372
Forts don't have powder rooms.

170
00:15:24,913 --> 00:15:25,881
Really?

171
00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:28,943
Where do the soldiers' wives go
to freshen up?

172
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:32,691
Soldiers don't have wives, stupid.

173
00:15:33,162 --> 00:15:36,863
Don't call me stupid, baby rump kisser!

174
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,842
It won't be a fort. It'll be a house.

175
00:15:42,147 --> 00:15:43,548
A love nest.

176
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:47,754
Let's go up and see
what color carpet we should get.

177
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:50,024
Do forts got carpet?

178
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:51,296
Nope.

179
00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:53,734
Forts don't got carpet!

180
00:15:54,271 --> 00:15:56,138
They do now, hot lips!

181
00:16:00,383 --> 00:16:03,048
The Selection Committee has informed...

182
00:16:03,256 --> 00:16:05,658
...Mrs. Butterwell and I...

183
00:16:05,861 --> 00:16:10,666
...that this summer's Floraganza
will be held in the garden of...

184
00:16:15,046 --> 00:16:16,811
Can you read this here?

185
00:16:20,657 --> 00:16:23,151
You take these and I'll take those.

186
00:16:24,564 --> 00:16:27,365
There we go. The garden of...

187
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:31,438
...George Wilson!

188
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:46,132
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi, three Mississippi...

189
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,678
...four Mississippi, five Mississippi.

190
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:49,941
Six Mississippi...

191
00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:54,457
...seven Mississippi, eight Mississippi,
nine Mississippi.

192
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:57,788
Gunther, are you watching
where everybody goes?

193
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:00,059
Yep.

194
00:17:04,244 --> 00:17:06,077
Girls. Now...

195
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:10,186
Let's go!

196
00:17:13,696 --> 00:17:16,600
You know,
I was unbeatable at hide-and-seek.

197
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,236
Hiding or seeking?

198
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,901
Both. I had a nose for hiding places.

199
00:17:21,478 --> 00:17:23,675
I wouldn't think you'd be much good
at hiding.

200
00:17:23,749 --> 00:17:24,978
Why not?

201
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:27,019
Weren't you a fat boy?

202
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:29,826
I was husky.

203
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,193
Ready or not, here I come!

204
00:17:36,308 --> 00:17:37,503
I see Joey and Mike!

205
00:17:37,577 --> 00:17:38,943
Run, Mikey!

206
00:17:39,514 --> 00:17:41,005
He's cheating.

207
00:17:42,252 --> 00:17:43,915
What are you doing?

208
00:17:44,825 --> 00:17:48,595
Dennis is cheating.
He's using the Beckman kid as a spy.

209
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:51,162
Leave them alone, George.

210
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:53,403
I'll even things up.

211
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:58,309
Gunther, I'm just talking to your daddy
on the telephone.

212
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:02,390
He's going to the ice-cream store.
He wants to take you with him.

213
00:18:02,827 --> 00:18:04,854
Hurry up and go home!

214
00:18:08,104 --> 00:18:09,630
Now it's fair.

215
00:18:12,981 --> 00:18:15,213
You lied to a toddler, George.

216
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,655
Think how disappointed he will be
when he gets home.

217
00:18:19,728 --> 00:18:23,759
He better get used to it.
Disappointment will be a big part of his life.

218
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:27,708
He's a foot short for his age.
And he's cross-eyed.

219
00:19:27,496 --> 00:19:29,796
Ain't that a pretty sight?

220
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:34,301
I bet they don't even lock their doors.

221
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:42,723
You won't notice a toy store
on the first level...

222
00:19:42,793 --> 00:19:44,262
...but my suggestion is this:

223
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:48,497
Give the toy store six months free rent
to move up to the third level.

224
00:19:53,481 --> 00:19:57,888
When I go to the mall with my little boy,
we always visit the toy store.

225
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:03,126
He knows he won't get anything unless
it's a special occasion, but like every kid...

226
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,669
...he wants to look around...

227
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:07,296
Could you spare us the family anecdotes?

228
00:20:09,371 --> 00:20:12,168
There's always a lot of traffic in toy stores.

229
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,833
If people have to go up to the third level
to visit the toy store...

230
00:20:15,908 --> 00:20:19,171
...then they have to go through
two other levels to get there.

231
00:20:19,243 --> 00:20:21,335
That's apparent to anyone with children.

232
00:20:21,411 --> 00:20:23,741
And you have to assume
that potential tenants...

233
00:20:23,811 --> 00:20:26,438
...might have kids and would know that...

234
00:20:26,546 --> 00:20:30,537
...and it might entice them
to take up space in the other levels.

235
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:33,479
That's all I'm saying.

236
00:20:38,218 --> 00:20:41,152
We could have carried up a lot more stuff...

237
00:20:41,253 --> 00:20:45,243
...if you didn't have to bring that idiotic doll
and all her junk!

238
00:20:45,321 --> 00:20:49,119
She's not idiotic!
She's an important training tool.

239
00:20:49,189 --> 00:20:53,419
You know why men are so lousy
when it comes to taking care of babies?

240
00:20:53,725 --> 00:20:55,953
They have better things to do.

241
00:20:56,092 --> 00:20:59,060
Like what? Play golf and drink beer?

242
00:20:59,128 --> 00:21:03,994
No, like hunting, having wars, driving cars,
shaving, cleaning fish.

243
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,528
Do you know how to do that?

244
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,689
Me?

245
00:21:06,997 --> 00:21:08,089
Margaret.

246
00:21:08,265 --> 00:21:09,026
Oh, okay.

247
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:11,691
If you didn't have women,
you wouldn't have babies...

248
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:13,922
...and you wouldn't have people.

249
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:18,267
If you didn't have men,
who'd drive the ladies to the hospital?

250
00:21:20,036 --> 00:21:24,993
Most important, they marry the women,
then the women can go and get the baby.

251
00:21:25,072 --> 00:21:27,301
The baby is in her stomach!

252
00:21:27,774 --> 00:21:32,435
She has to get it installed.
Her stomach isn't just filled up with babies.

253
00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:35,772
- Who installs them?
- A minister and a doctor.

254
00:21:35,977 --> 00:21:37,341
- How?
- How?

255
00:21:38,311 --> 00:21:40,210
She wants to know how?

256
00:21:46,915 --> 00:21:48,779
Tell me, Dennis, how?

257
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,880
The bellybutton. It opens up.

258
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:55,842
- How come men have them?
- So they don't look weird in bathing suits.

259
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,144
Okay, on the count of three...

260
00:22:00,355 --> 00:22:02,049
...move your hand.

261
00:22:02,156 --> 00:22:03,213
One.

262
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:06,781
Two.

263
00:22:09,325 --> 00:22:10,484
Three!

264
00:22:15,661 --> 00:22:18,651
Okay, this time on the count of four.

265
00:22:19,563 --> 00:22:20,620
One.

266
00:22:21,597 --> 00:22:23,120
Two.

267
00:22:23,331 --> 00:22:24,490
Three.

268
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:26,156
Four!

269
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,729
Joey, you hold the hammer
and, Margaret, you hold the nail.

270
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:48,739
We did a pretty good job.

271
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,606
- How about a little paint?
- Couldn't hurt.

272
00:22:51,677 --> 00:22:54,008
- You got any?
- My dad does.

273
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:04,945
- Give me my doll, you jerk!
- I don't have it!

274
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:09,208
- Give it to me! Dennis!
- I didn't take your doll.

275
00:23:09,285 --> 00:23:11,684
It's not here. Somebody took it.

276
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,844
We've been with you.

277
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:21,384
Do you guys swear you didn't take it?

278
00:23:21,557 --> 00:23:22,615
Yep.

279
00:23:24,292 --> 00:23:25,918
I've been robbed!

280
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:36,895
You don't understand.
Baby Louise is a very expensive antique.

281
00:23:37,364 --> 00:23:39,421
Nobody robbed your doll.

282
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:41,497
- Maybe a bear ate it.
- What?

283
00:23:41,866 --> 00:23:44,698
Yeah, there's no robbers in our town.

284
00:24:40,725 --> 00:24:42,715
What are you eating there, sport?

285
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:45,182
A apple.

286
00:26:00,828 --> 00:26:01,953
Hi, Mr. Mitchell.

287
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:04,259
Hello, Polly. Come on in.

288
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,659
- What's the helmet for?
- My girlfriend used to baby-sit for Dennis.

289
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:10,391
She said to bring a helmet and wear pants.

290
00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:50,173
I'm looking for Polly.

291
00:27:50,743 --> 00:27:52,232
You're Mickey?

292
00:27:52,577 --> 00:27:53,668
Yeah.

293
00:27:54,345 --> 00:27:57,779
She's up in my mom's bathroom
using the armpit perfume.

294
00:27:57,846 --> 00:28:02,075
She says you're such a stud,
she gets nervous and sweats a lot.

295
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:04,203
Cool.

296
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,180
Come on in.

297
00:28:47,301 --> 00:28:48,767
Tastes funny.

298
00:28:55,905 --> 00:28:57,565
Tastes like paint.

299
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:01,835
And wood.

300
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:06,504
I'll make us some sandwiches.

301
00:29:25,151 --> 00:29:27,846
<i>"Do not cry, little locomotive, "...</i>

302
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,354
<i>"...said old Engine Number 99 to Huffy."</i>

303
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:37,050
<i>"One day when you grow up,
you will realize..."</i>

304
00:29:37,123 --> 00:29:40,114
<i>"... that all trains are impotent, important..."</i>

305
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:43,319
<i>"... even little mail trains."</i>

306
00:29:46,594 --> 00:29:48,185
How can a train grow?

307
00:29:48,261 --> 00:29:51,422
He eats all his coal
and gets plenty of sleep.

308
00:29:52,297 --> 00:29:55,731
No, what's the point of reading lies?

309
00:29:56,532 --> 00:29:59,829
It teaches kids to eat all their food...

310
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,765
...and go to bed when they're supposed to.

311
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:07,202
And not cry when mean cabooses
and boxcars make fun of them.

312
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,077
This is so stupid.

313
00:30:11,145 --> 00:30:14,081
Are you ready to get out of here
and go to bed, yet?

314
00:30:14,182 --> 00:30:17,641
I'm not even wrinkled up yet.
Keep reading.

315
00:30:22,894 --> 00:30:27,764
<i>"I will never be big enough to pull anything
but silly old mail cars, ..."</i>

316
00:30:28,401 --> 00:30:29,994
<i>"...sobbed Huffy."</i>

317
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:34,299
<i>"Sob..."</i>

318
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:37,103
<i>"Sobbobed Huffy."</i>

319
00:30:45,956 --> 00:30:47,685
Where are you going?

320
00:30:56,537 --> 00:30:59,336
I'm going to investigate Mitchell's garage.

321
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:03,242
Dennis has been fooling around with paint.
I know it, and I will prove it.

322
00:31:03,546 --> 00:31:06,641
Aren't you taking this a bit far, George?

323
00:31:07,517 --> 00:31:09,109
He's only a boy.

324
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:06,584
Kids!

325
00:32:24,115 --> 00:32:25,811
G.D. Wading pool!

326
00:32:37,532 --> 00:32:38,864
That's it!

327
00:33:37,009 --> 00:33:40,002
Gee, I guess those kids took off.

328
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:57,963
I got him this time.

329
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,336
Mitchell can't deny it.

330
00:34:19,897 --> 00:34:21,489
Sorry. Good night.

331
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,467
He's only a boy, huh?

332
00:35:10,461 --> 00:35:12,053
Hi, Mrs. Wilson.

333
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:15,196
Is Mr. Wilson up yet?

334
00:35:15,367 --> 00:35:16,858
Not yet, dear.

335
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,538
How long do you think he's going to sleep?

336
00:35:19,606 --> 00:35:22,838
Not too much longer.
He's having his picture taken this morning.

337
00:35:22,943 --> 00:35:26,641
- For what?
- He's being honored for his garden.

338
00:35:27,683 --> 00:35:30,847
Do you think he would get mad
if I went upstairs?

339
00:35:31,688 --> 00:35:34,157
What do you want to go upstairs for?

340
00:35:34,225 --> 00:35:37,661
I made an <i>"I'm Sorry I Shot Paint
on Your Chicken"</i> card.

341
00:35:38,364 --> 00:35:40,355
That's very nice, Dennis.

342
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:44,967
I'm kind of busy today,
so I won't have a chance to give it to him.

343
00:35:45,706 --> 00:35:47,833
I have to go to Margaret's house...

344
00:35:47,909 --> 00:35:50,879
...because we're getting poor,
and my mom's got a job now.

345
00:35:50,946 --> 00:35:53,643
Could I leave it by his whisker cutter?

346
00:35:53,983 --> 00:35:56,452
That's where I leave
my dad's <i>"Sorry"</i> cards.

347
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,251
And it's a good time to say you're sorry.

348
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:02,157
Grownup guys are happy in the morning
when they wake up.

349
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:03,422
My dad's so happy...

350
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:05,760
...he whistles
when he goes to the bathroom.

351
00:36:05,865 --> 00:36:08,596
The only time he isn't happy
is on Sunday morning...

352
00:36:08,669 --> 00:36:10,262
...when he and my mom wrestle.

353
00:36:10,338 --> 00:36:12,363
They like to be alone when they do that.

354
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,636
I think it's because they take off
their shirts.

355
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,337
Then they start to make funny noises...

356
00:36:16,412 --> 00:36:17,505
You can go up...

357
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:20,607
...as long as you promise
not to disturb Mr. Wilson.

358
00:36:20,684 --> 00:36:22,016
I promise.

359
00:36:26,825 --> 00:36:28,919
You know what, Mrs. Wilson?

360
00:36:29,295 --> 00:36:30,387
What?

361
00:36:30,463 --> 00:36:33,399
You're the nicest old gal on the block.

362
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,531
Hello.

363
00:37:34,011 --> 00:37:35,774
My name is Dennis Mitchell.

364
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:40,447
I'm the doctor. Open up and say...

365
00:38:15,765 --> 00:38:16,754
Hello.

366
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:26,537
Mr. Wilson.

367
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,976
George? Are you ready?

368
00:38:30,651 --> 00:38:32,642
The photographer's here.

369
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,520
I got a 9:30, ma'am.

370
00:38:37,826 --> 00:38:39,794
He'll be out any second.

371
00:38:40,997 --> 00:38:42,089
Sorry.

372
00:38:46,337 --> 00:38:47,326
George?

373
00:38:53,946 --> 00:38:56,745
That looks fine, Martha. Leave it alone.

374
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,419
Martha, step back. You're in the picture.

375
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,592
Very good.

376
00:39:05,996 --> 00:39:07,224
Now...

377
00:39:07,497 --> 00:39:08,486
...smile.

378
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,027
Hey, you.

379
00:40:04,505 --> 00:40:06,497
Yeah, you. Come here.

380
00:40:14,254 --> 00:40:16,553
I haven't seen you around here before.

381
00:40:18,794 --> 00:40:21,492
Maybe because
I've never been around here.

382
00:40:21,632 --> 00:40:23,066
What are you up to?

383
00:40:23,134 --> 00:40:24,762
What's it to you?

384
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,859
Now, look.

385
00:40:26,606 --> 00:40:30,237
I run a nice, clean town here
and I don't want any trouble.

386
00:40:30,646 --> 00:40:33,845
My advice to you
is just follow the sun out of here.

387
00:40:33,918 --> 00:40:37,651
Only reason I ain't moving on because
you stopped to give me the breeze.

388
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:06,928
You have to go to two other levels
to get there and...

389
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,448
Can I call you back?

390
00:41:18,622 --> 00:41:19,611
Hi, Mom.

391
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:21,825
Good morning.

392
00:41:21,926 --> 00:41:25,125
I hear you're trying to beg off
the Oklahoma City trip.

393
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:27,625
I asked that it be rescheduled.

394
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:30,532
Have a Cub Scout meeting or something?

395
00:41:30,706 --> 00:41:33,973
My husband has a trip
that was scheduled before mine.

396
00:41:35,915 --> 00:41:39,182
If you two are traveling at the same time,
no one can watch your kid.

397
00:41:39,253 --> 00:41:40,585
Is that the problem?

398
00:41:40,656 --> 00:41:43,320
- It's not a problem, per se.
- Oh, good.

399
00:41:43,394 --> 00:41:47,526
Because if you want to blow off your trip,
I have to cover for you.

400
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:50,167
And I have plans I can't break.

401
00:41:50,638 --> 00:41:52,607
I don't have kids but...

402
00:41:53,476 --> 00:41:55,103
...I do have a life.

403
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:57,879
I'm sorry.

404
00:41:59,404 --> 00:42:01,532
I just won't be able to help you.

405
00:42:08,051 --> 00:42:09,109
God.

406
00:42:10,688 --> 00:42:12,783
- Okay.
- Who do we call first?

407
00:42:13,993 --> 00:42:16,087
Let's start with the A's.

408
00:42:16,264 --> 00:42:17,322
Vicki?

409
00:42:17,398 --> 00:42:18,889
- You call.
- No, you call.

410
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:22,335
Hello.

411
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:26,033
Hi. This is Mrs. Mitchell.

412
00:42:32,322 --> 00:42:34,291
Hi. Alice Mitchell.

413
00:42:36,395 --> 00:42:37,658
Hi. Alice Mitchell.

414
00:42:38,398 --> 00:42:39,093
No.

415
00:42:42,872 --> 00:42:44,898
This is Henry Mitchell.

416
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,640
This is Henry Mitchell.

417
00:43:05,141 --> 00:43:06,403
You call.

418
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:24,533
Hey, Mr. Wilson. I'm sleeping at your joint.

419
00:43:28,944 --> 00:43:32,609
- I brought you some grasshoppers.
- You shouldn't have.

420
00:43:32,883 --> 00:43:34,408
I'll take them, dear.

421
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:39,118
Thank you so much, Martha. George.

422
00:43:39,427 --> 00:43:40,452
It's our pleasure.

423
00:43:40,529 --> 00:43:43,932
- You saved our lives.
- Save two, lose one.

424
00:43:44,035 --> 00:43:46,129
I'll call you just as soon as I arrive.

425
00:43:46,205 --> 00:43:48,732
- Do you have our number?
- Don't worry about a thing.

426
00:43:50,479 --> 00:43:53,939
I brought my own pillow
so I don't get my spit on yours.

427
00:43:54,017 --> 00:43:55,610
Thank you, dear.

428
00:43:57,757 --> 00:43:59,555
Be a good boy, okay?

429
00:44:02,731 --> 00:44:06,031
Mind your manners
and listen to Mr. And Mrs. Wilson.

430
00:44:10,109 --> 00:44:11,577
- Thanks again.
- Thank you.

431
00:44:14,282 --> 00:44:15,443
Honey?

432
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:18,811
Bye-bye.

433
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:21,155
Bring me something good.

434
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,455
'Bye, sweetheart.

435
00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:23,997
'Bye, Dennis.

436
00:44:25,032 --> 00:44:29,267
George, take Dennis' suitcase
up to the guest room, please.

437
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:33,007
- He's got arms.
- Don't start, dear.

438
00:44:35,248 --> 00:44:38,219
You know why I'm not crying?

439
00:44:39,856 --> 00:44:42,348
Because if I can't be with my parents...

440
00:44:42,426 --> 00:44:45,124
...the person I want to be with is you.

441
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:51,398
I can't tell you how deeply moved I am.

442
00:45:17,716 --> 00:45:19,343
Don't do that, please.

443
00:45:19,418 --> 00:45:20,214
What?

444
00:45:20,286 --> 00:45:21,481
The cord.

445
00:45:21,555 --> 00:45:23,217
Stop that tapping.

446
00:45:27,564 --> 00:45:31,263
There's not a lot to do around the house
when it's raining out.

447
00:45:33,908 --> 00:45:36,309
- Do you wanna play cards?
- No.

448
00:45:38,749 --> 00:45:41,583
Want to put on your old Navy suit
and play war?

449
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:54,236
- Is that pirates' gold?
- No.

450
00:45:55,074 --> 00:45:56,599
Is it real valuable?

451
00:45:57,311 --> 00:45:58,301
Yes.

452
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,409
Is that why you keep it in your safe?

453
00:46:01,685 --> 00:46:02,674
Uh-huh.

454
00:46:04,188 --> 00:46:06,316
How come your safe looks like books?

455
00:46:08,262 --> 00:46:10,754
How come you ask so many questions?

456
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:13,735
I've only been around for five years.

457
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:15,898
There's a lot of stuff I don't know.

458
00:46:19,846 --> 00:46:21,838
The safe looks like books...

459
00:46:22,284 --> 00:46:25,722
...so if a thief does come in,
he won't recognize it.

460
00:46:26,357 --> 00:46:28,588
- Is a thief a robber?
- Yes.

461
00:46:28,793 --> 00:46:31,662
- Have you ever had a robber here?
- No.

462
00:46:32,532 --> 00:46:34,525
What's the combination to your lock?

463
00:46:36,306 --> 00:46:39,675
You're the last person in the world
I'd tell that to.

464
00:46:40,145 --> 00:46:42,273
You've got it wrote down someplace?

465
00:46:42,348 --> 00:46:43,748
It's in my head.

466
00:46:43,817 --> 00:46:47,550
- What's that mean?
- It means I know it. I remember it.

467
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:51,455
- What if you forget it?
- I won't forget it. It's a familiar number.

468
00:46:51,529 --> 00:46:52,929
I won't forget it.

469
00:46:53,165 --> 00:46:54,793
What's that mean?

470
00:46:54,934 --> 00:46:59,465
It means it's a number
that I use all the time, so I won't forget it.

471
00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:01,642
I use it all the time.

472
00:47:02,279 --> 00:47:04,943
- I bet I know what it is.
- I doubt that.

473
00:47:05,251 --> 00:47:07,379
I bet it's your address.

474
00:47:08,322 --> 00:47:09,688
Know how I know?

475
00:47:09,758 --> 00:47:11,522
My friend has a bike lock...

476
00:47:11,594 --> 00:47:16,158
...and he uses his address
for the combination so he won't forget.

477
00:47:16,402 --> 00:47:18,530
- You're just as smart as him.
- He.

478
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:22,438
You got everything figured out, don't you?

479
00:47:23,747 --> 00:47:28,243
I haven't figured out
how to get my work done...

480
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,313
...with you in the house.

481
00:47:31,792 --> 00:47:33,522
That's a tough one.

482
00:47:50,922 --> 00:47:53,051
Are you wrinkled enough yet, Dennis?

483
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:57,894
- Yep.
- Want me to come help you out of the tub?

484
00:47:58,468 --> 00:48:00,903
Not unless you want to see
what the stork saw.

485
00:48:26,345 --> 00:48:27,437
Cool!

486
00:48:27,713 --> 00:48:29,238
Old Faithful.

487
00:49:36,889 --> 00:49:40,657
- How old is this bed?
- It belonged to my mother.

488
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:42,964
What's she sleeping on?

489
00:49:43,533 --> 00:49:45,627
She's been gone for many years, Dennis.

490
00:49:47,739 --> 00:49:49,503
- On business?
- No.

491
00:49:50,411 --> 00:49:52,004
She's in heaven.

492
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,748
There's an awful lot of people in heaven.

493
00:49:56,453 --> 00:49:58,319
Especially old people.

494
00:50:09,874 --> 00:50:13,966
How about if I recite my favorite poem
when I was your age?

495
00:50:14,575 --> 00:50:16,803
- Is it about flowers and lambs?
- No.

496
00:50:17,675 --> 00:50:18,663
Okay.

497
00:50:21,343 --> 00:50:25,070
<i>Wynken, Blynken, and Nod one night</i>

498
00:50:25,142 --> 00:50:27,631
<i>Sailed off in a wooden shoe</i>

499
00:50:28,309 --> 00:50:31,538
<i>Sailed on a river of crystal light</i>

500
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:33,235
<i>Into a sea of dew</i>

501
00:50:34,877 --> 00:50:38,037
<i>Where are you going
and what do you wish?</i>

502
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:41,605
<i>The old moon asked the three</i>

503
00:50:41,678 --> 00:50:46,576
<i>We have come to fish for the herring fish
That live in the beautiful sea</i>

504
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:50,243
<i>"Nets of silver and gold have we!"</i>

505
00:50:50,712 --> 00:50:53,543
<i>"Said Wynken, Blynken, and Nod"</i>

506
00:50:54,946 --> 00:50:58,106
<i>"Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes"</i>

507
00:50:58,946 --> 00:51:01,037
<i>"And Nod is a little head"</i>

508
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,674
<i>"And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies"</i>

509
00:51:06,181 --> 00:51:08,272
<i>"Is a wee one's trundle bed"</i>

510
00:51:09,981 --> 00:51:12,970
<i>"Now shut your eyes while Mother sings"</i>

511
00:51:13,047 --> 00:51:15,479
<i>"Of wonderful sights that be"</i>

512
00:51:17,082 --> 00:51:20,014
<i>"And you shall see the beautiful things"</i>

513
00:51:20,549 --> 00:51:23,811
<i>"As you rock in the misty sea"</i>

514
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:27,211
<i>"Where the old shoe
rocked the fishermen three"</i>

515
00:51:28,183 --> 00:51:29,206
<i>"Wynken"</i>

516
00:51:30,216 --> 00:51:31,682
<i>"Blynken"</i>

517
00:51:32,516 --> 00:51:33,880
<i>"and Nod"</i>

518
00:52:28,888 --> 00:52:31,218
New pajamas. God bless 'em.

519
00:52:53,092 --> 00:52:56,115
Poor thing.
I wish he'd get that hernia fixed.

520
00:53:57,598 --> 00:53:59,587
George, are you sleeping?

521
00:54:01,099 --> 00:54:03,429
I was until you started yakking.

522
00:54:03,832 --> 00:54:05,162
I'm sorry.

523
00:54:07,632 --> 00:54:09,723
Was Dennis in our bathroom?

524
00:54:10,366 --> 00:54:11,355
Yes.

525
00:54:11,933 --> 00:54:16,389
I think the little rat
put mouthwash in my nasal spray...

526
00:54:17,001 --> 00:54:19,694
...and toilet cleanser in my mouthwash.

527
00:54:21,134 --> 00:54:23,657
Why would he do something like that?

528
00:54:25,701 --> 00:54:27,166
Must you ask?

529
00:54:33,002 --> 00:54:34,161
Quiet!

530
00:54:36,168 --> 00:54:38,657
I recited a poem for Dennis tonight...

531
00:54:39,336 --> 00:54:42,029
...that my mother used to recite to me.

532
00:54:43,436 --> 00:54:45,402
I remembered every word.

533
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:49,768
In some tiny measure...

534
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:54,059
...my mother would be proud
I passed something on.

535
00:54:54,938 --> 00:54:56,597
It's 10:00, Martha.

536
00:54:57,537 --> 00:54:59,730
Don't start with the regrets.

537
00:55:04,505 --> 00:55:06,835
I would have been a good mother.

538
00:55:09,705 --> 00:55:12,331
And I would have made a swell fireman.

539
00:55:26,707 --> 00:55:30,162
- Where are you going?
- To make myself a cup of tea.

540
00:55:34,241 --> 00:55:37,299
I didn't decree
that we wouldn't have children.

541
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:40,171
That was out of both our hands.

542
00:55:41,908 --> 00:55:45,432
This isn't about having children
or not having children.

543
00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:47,498
You miss the point.

544
00:55:48,943 --> 00:55:50,409
It's about...

545
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:54,401
...my feeling something very good...

546
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:57,609
...and not being able to tell you about it.

547
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:39,470
Martha?

548
00:56:45,615 --> 00:56:47,639
I didn't mean to hurt you.

549
00:56:48,416 --> 00:56:51,576
I'm not terribly good
with feelings and emotions.

550
00:56:52,783 --> 00:56:56,806
There are a lot of subjects
I'd just as soon not bring up or discuss.

551
00:56:57,717 --> 00:57:00,649
I would have liked a son or a daughter.

552
00:57:02,184 --> 00:57:05,275
You couldn't fire the fatherly feelings
in me...

553
00:57:06,251 --> 00:57:07,841
...because they're not there.

554
00:57:08,852 --> 00:57:12,216
But that doesn't mean my feelings for you
have gone cold.

555
00:57:12,284 --> 00:57:14,080
That'll never happen.

556
00:57:15,185 --> 00:57:17,481
You've got all the love I have.

557
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,341
Remember this?

558
00:57:22,186 --> 00:57:26,243
<i>Je t'aime. Je t'adore. Ma petite chérie.</i>

559
00:57:35,354 --> 00:57:36,342
George.

560
00:57:50,189 --> 00:57:51,882
Get out of here!

561
00:57:57,590 --> 00:57:59,818
What are you looking for now?

562
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:02,081
Garden lanterns.

563
00:58:03,024 --> 00:58:07,514
You must be pretty brave to ride
on a tiger in your underpants.

564
00:58:07,891 --> 00:58:10,153
Put that away. That's not for kids!

565
00:59:10,663 --> 00:59:11,652
Martha.

566
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,620
Where are the G.D. Garden lanterns?

567
00:59:41,601 --> 00:59:43,897
I think I better go outside and play.

568
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:04,958
Hello.

569
01:00:05,803 --> 01:00:06,827
Hello, Martha.

570
01:00:07,571 --> 01:00:08,936
It's Alice.

571
01:00:09,073 --> 01:00:10,506
I'm still in Oklahoma.

572
01:00:10,908 --> 01:00:12,170
Oh, dear.

573
01:00:12,443 --> 01:00:14,673
<i>Yes, there's a terrible storm.</i>

574
01:00:14,745 --> 01:00:16,007
<i>My flight's been cancelled.</i>

575
01:00:16,614 --> 01:00:19,811
Till the weather clears,
I don't know what's going to happen.

576
01:00:21,685 --> 01:00:24,245
<i>I know your garden party's tonight.
I feel terrible.</i>

577
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:26,619
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

578
01:00:27,024 --> 01:00:30,357
Don't worry about it.
You get home when you can.

579
01:00:31,028 --> 01:00:32,825
We'll be just fine here.

580
01:00:33,431 --> 01:00:35,524
What's George going to say?

581
01:00:37,501 --> 01:00:39,935
Over my dead body!

582
01:00:40,271 --> 01:00:45,004
This is my crowning moment of retired life
and I won't throw it away like the trash...

583
01:00:45,076 --> 01:00:48,671
...for a ninny who can't get her keister
to the airport on time.

584
01:00:48,746 --> 01:00:51,715
George Wilson,
you have no right to insult Alice.

585
01:00:51,782 --> 01:00:54,808
She can't help the weather,
any more than you or I.

586
01:00:54,885 --> 01:00:56,477
It's just plain bad luck.

587
01:00:56,554 --> 01:00:58,283
It's no one's fault.

588
01:00:58,355 --> 01:01:02,086
A tragedy of this magnitude
has to be somebody's fault.

589
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:03,888
It isn't a tragedy.

590
01:01:04,061 --> 01:01:06,757
A little boy's going to join us for a party.

591
01:01:07,531 --> 01:01:11,865
If you want to forsake your neighbors
when they need help, do it alone.

592
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:16,834
Why is it, when everyone else
feasts on the pleasures of life...

593
01:01:16,907 --> 01:01:18,272
...I get the indigestion?

594
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:20,469
Because you're an old grump.

595
01:01:37,394 --> 01:01:39,658
We did a pretty good job.

596
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:41,630
Uh-huh.

597
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:45,260
Now we can order furniture
and major appliances.

598
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:37,845
Well, Dennis...

599
01:02:37,955 --> 01:02:40,389
<i>...</i>your mother did not arrive.
- Nope.

600
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:43,892
This is an important event for me.

601
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:45,355
I know.

602
01:02:45,496 --> 01:02:47,191
I don't want any nonsense.

603
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:50,722
You mind whatever manners you have
and don't be a pest.

604
01:02:50,801 --> 01:02:51,790
Okay.

605
01:02:51,869 --> 01:02:53,632
Don't embarrass me.

606
01:02:53,737 --> 01:02:54,726
Okay.

607
01:02:56,907 --> 01:02:58,431
Cheek pinchers.

608
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,007
Look at the cute little boy.

609
01:03:07,985 --> 01:03:10,112
Are you our little host?

610
01:03:10,321 --> 01:03:13,051
The party's in the back.

611
01:03:13,857 --> 01:03:16,724
Ladies, girls, the party's in the back.

612
01:03:16,794 --> 01:03:20,355
Thank you very much.
It's just this way, thank you.

613
01:03:20,931 --> 01:03:22,660
Don't embarrass me.

614
01:03:27,438 --> 01:03:28,871
Attention, everyone.

615
01:03:28,939 --> 01:03:30,770
Gather over here, please.

616
01:03:30,841 --> 01:03:34,208
Have a seat.
It's time to begin the ceremony.

617
01:03:34,678 --> 01:03:37,010
All right, members, don't be timid.

618
01:03:37,081 --> 01:03:39,481
Move down front. Plenty of seats.

619
01:03:39,617 --> 01:03:41,608
Either side, either side.

620
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,481
<i>"On behalf of the Garden Club..."</i>

621
01:03:44,555 --> 01:03:46,284
<i>"Selection Committee."</i>

622
01:03:46,357 --> 01:03:49,724
<i>- "We'd like to present..."
- "George Wilson."</i>

623
01:03:49,793 --> 01:03:52,057
<i>"With this beautiful..."</i>

624
01:03:54,031 --> 01:03:55,055
What does that say?

625
01:03:55,132 --> 01:03:57,362
<i>"Plague."</i> What does that mean?

626
01:03:57,735 --> 01:03:59,999
- Here, let me have your glasses.
- <i>No. I...</i>

627
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:06,205
<i>"Plaque."</i> Come on up, George.

628
01:04:12,082 --> 01:04:14,516
Thank you, everyone. I am honored.

629
01:04:15,152 --> 01:04:17,313
I will cherish this forever.

630
01:04:18,689 --> 01:04:20,247
Forty years ago...

631
01:04:20,491 --> 01:04:23,722
...when I started this garden,
I planted a seed.

632
01:04:25,229 --> 01:04:27,322
From that tiny seed...

633
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:30,356
...grew this grand plant.

634
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:33,864
Tonight...

635
01:04:33,937 --> 01:04:38,431
...for the first and only time
in its entire life, it will blossom.

636
01:04:39,643 --> 01:04:41,543
As we await this glorious moment...

637
01:04:41,612 --> 01:04:45,173
...Martha and I invite you
to have some desert and coffee.

638
01:04:48,152 --> 01:04:49,881
Congratulations.

639
01:05:01,498 --> 01:05:03,864
George, would you bring the coffee?

640
01:05:13,177 --> 01:05:15,441
George, don't start, George.

641
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:20,679
Could you get somebody
to come and clear this away?

642
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:25,548
I made a mistake.

643
01:07:20,337 --> 01:07:21,929
Mr. Wilson!

644
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,933
Somebody robbed your house.

645
01:07:48,065 --> 01:07:50,829
Forty years down the drain.

646
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:08,918
You're a pest.

647
01:08:08,986 --> 01:08:10,248
A menace.

648
01:08:10,554 --> 01:08:14,081
A selfish, spoiled little boy
and I have no use for you.

649
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:18,519
You took something from me
that I can never get back.

650
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:21,325
Something that means more to me
than you ever will.

651
01:08:21,632 --> 01:08:23,156
You understand?

652
01:08:24,234 --> 01:08:26,862
I don't want to see you.
I don't want to know you.

653
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:30,200
Get out of my way.

654
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:35,802
I'm sorry, Mr. Wilson.

655
01:08:37,514 --> 01:08:40,449
Party's over, everybody. Go on home.

656
01:08:40,517 --> 01:08:41,848
I'm sorry.

657
01:09:27,431 --> 01:09:29,331
Oh, my God!

658
01:09:31,935 --> 01:09:33,232
Where's Dennis?

659
01:10:17,814 --> 01:10:20,078
Joey hasn't seen him all night?

660
01:10:21,852 --> 01:10:22,944
Okay.

661
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:25,614
Well, if he shows up, please call me.

662
01:10:26,189 --> 01:10:27,178
'Bye.

663
01:10:34,931 --> 01:10:37,422
- Did you call the Wades?
- Yes.

664
01:10:37,634 --> 01:10:40,432
But that's the last place he'd go.

665
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:49,635
<i>Don't you ever come back here again.</i>

666
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,970
<i>He's a menace.</i>

667
01:10:53,316 --> 01:10:54,806
<i>Turn that off!</i>

668
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:58,952
<i>Don't make a pest of yourself
and don't embarrass me.</i>

669
01:11:00,424 --> 01:11:03,885
<i>I don't want to know you.
I don't want to see you.</i>

670
01:11:03,997 --> 01:11:05,727
<i>Get out of my way.</i>

671
01:11:19,492 --> 01:11:21,689
These woods are pretty scary at night.

672
01:11:21,763 --> 01:11:24,165
I'm sure glad I ran into a grownup.

673
01:11:24,334 --> 01:11:26,327
It'll work out real nice.

674
01:11:26,705 --> 01:11:29,369
- You can be my hostage.
- Cool!

675
01:11:30,979 --> 01:11:33,576
I can only be your hostage till tomorrow.

676
01:11:34,018 --> 01:11:36,011
I have church in the morning.

677
01:11:38,059 --> 01:11:40,086
You ain't going to church.

678
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:43,864
You and me are catching the midnight train
out of here.

679
01:11:43,936 --> 01:11:44,926
Really?

680
01:11:45,506 --> 01:11:49,173
We better stop at my house first.
I have to tell my mom and dad...

681
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,408
...or else they'll worry.

682
01:11:50,482 --> 01:11:53,544
And I must get clean underwear
and my camera...

683
01:11:53,954 --> 01:11:56,755
...and tell my parents to feed my fish...

684
01:11:56,860 --> 01:11:58,226
...some sun block...

685
01:11:58,296 --> 01:12:02,669
...and vitamins and stuff to play with
on the train so I don't get bored.

686
01:12:02,738 --> 01:12:05,072
Put a cork in it.
You're giving me a headache.

687
01:12:05,142 --> 01:12:06,167
I don't have a cork.

688
01:12:06,244 --> 01:12:07,837
Shut your mouth!

689
01:12:08,181 --> 01:12:11,085
I can't because my nose is stuffy
because of my allergies.

690
01:12:11,153 --> 01:12:13,019
If I shut my mouth, I can't breathe good.

691
01:12:13,089 --> 01:12:15,925
Then keep your mouth open, but don't talk!

692
01:12:17,998 --> 01:12:21,300
Where do you put the cork
when you put a cork in it?

693
01:12:22,207 --> 01:12:24,143
Didn't I ask you to shut your yap?

694
01:12:24,211 --> 01:12:26,339
What's a yap?

695
01:12:27,382 --> 01:12:28,611
It's your mouth.

696
01:12:28,685 --> 01:12:31,521
I can't shut my mouth
because my nose is stuffy.

697
01:12:31,591 --> 01:12:32,820
Shut up!

698
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:44,502
I have one more question.

699
01:12:46,284 --> 01:12:47,377
What?

700
01:12:47,887 --> 01:12:50,187
What does a hostage have to do?

701
01:12:50,626 --> 01:12:51,752
Nothing.

702
01:12:51,828 --> 01:12:53,126
How come you need one?

703
01:12:54,031 --> 01:12:56,297
In case the cops show up.

704
01:12:56,837 --> 01:12:58,328
Do I get to use a gun?

705
01:12:58,406 --> 01:13:01,845
You get to stand in front of me
if the cops use a gun.

706
01:13:04,217 --> 01:13:06,015
I've got a slingshot.

707
01:13:07,055 --> 01:13:08,114
Swell.

708
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:10,387
I'm a good shot. Want to see?

709
01:13:12,632 --> 01:13:16,093
Excuse me, mister. Do you want to see?

710
01:13:17,474 --> 01:13:20,104
Mister, can you watch me for a minute?

711
01:13:23,385 --> 01:13:25,480
I'll tell you when to look.

712
01:13:34,605 --> 01:13:35,766
Look!

713
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:42,279
Your fire's getting puny.

714
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:48,528
When my dad's fire gets puny,
he wiggles it around and it gets bigger.

715
01:14:34,682 --> 01:14:35,707
Dennis!

716
01:14:47,071 --> 01:14:48,369
Dennis!

717
01:14:51,379 --> 01:14:54,681
I'm sorry
you're not having a very fun camping trip.

718
01:14:56,322 --> 01:14:59,692
Nobody shoots a marble at my head...

719
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:01,696
...and sets my pants on fire.

720
01:15:02,099 --> 01:15:03,465
That was an accident.

721
01:15:03,535 --> 01:15:06,370
There ain't going to be no more accidents!

722
01:15:07,041 --> 01:15:08,441
Turn around!

723
01:15:19,664 --> 01:15:21,531
You're doing it wrong.

724
01:15:21,668 --> 01:15:22,931
Get lost.

725
01:15:23,472 --> 01:15:25,908
I tied up lots of guys in my life.

726
01:15:26,143 --> 01:15:29,604
I bet you've never tied up a 5-year-old.
I'll just get out.

727
01:15:29,683 --> 01:15:32,654
I'll tie it so tight
you won't be able to move.

728
01:15:32,721 --> 01:15:36,023
The rope's too big and my legs are
too small to make it tight enough.

729
01:15:36,663 --> 01:15:38,859
There's only one way to do it
and I know because...

730
01:15:38,933 --> 01:15:41,871
...many people have tried to tie me up
but it doesn't work.

731
01:15:41,939 --> 01:15:43,271
But you try your way.

732
01:15:43,341 --> 01:15:46,107
I'll get out
and you'll just have to keep doing it.

733
01:15:54,194 --> 01:15:55,719
What do you do differently?

734
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:04,472
First, you must tie up each leg by itself.

735
01:16:04,947 --> 01:16:07,042
Then you tie them together.

736
01:16:24,416 --> 01:16:27,684
No matter how much I wiggle,
I can't ever get out.

737
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,458
If you really don't want me to move at all<i>...</i>

738
01:16:39,477 --> 01:16:40,809
Bend down.

739
01:16:45,422 --> 01:16:47,618
You can't get out of that at all, right?

740
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:52,931
Nope.

741
01:16:53,002 --> 01:16:57,602
You tie me up like that, no matter
how much I try, I can't ever get out.

742
01:16:57,877 --> 01:16:58,867
Thanks.

743
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:02,578
- Now let me loose.
- Okay.

744
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,252
Get the handcuff key.

745
01:17:04,322 --> 01:17:06,451
- Where is it?
- On my bag.

746
01:17:31,038 --> 01:17:32,130
What?

747
01:17:36,448 --> 01:17:37,643
Dennis!

748
01:17:41,557 --> 01:17:42,650
Dennis!

749
01:17:54,681 --> 01:17:56,172
I'm going to kill you.

750
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:58,550
How? You can't move. Open up.

751
01:17:59,056 --> 01:18:00,581
I ain't hungry!

752
01:18:00,892 --> 01:18:03,294
It's the only way to get the key.

753
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:05,229
You can't waste food.

754
01:18:05,401 --> 01:18:07,701
Plus, you must eat your dinner.

755
01:18:10,711 --> 01:18:11,940
Come on.

756
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,680
Come on.

757
01:18:16,254 --> 01:18:17,745
It's coming.

758
01:18:26,773 --> 01:18:28,002
Too hot?

759
01:18:46,142 --> 01:18:48,339
You must have swallowed it.

760
01:18:51,686 --> 01:18:53,655
I swallowed my allowance once.

761
01:18:53,722 --> 01:18:57,092
I had to wait a whole night and a day
to get it back.

762
01:19:08,049 --> 01:19:09,039
Dennis!

763
01:20:00,311 --> 01:20:02,713
Firewood. Bombs away!

764
01:20:20,147 --> 01:20:22,174
Poor little lamb.

765
01:20:22,485 --> 01:20:24,850
He must be exhausted.

766
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:29,084
I better cover him up
so he doesn't catch his death of cold.

767
01:21:18,129 --> 01:21:19,562
There we go.

768
01:21:48,352 --> 01:21:50,377
What's he got a purse for?

769
01:21:56,792 --> 01:21:58,191
Holy smokes!

770
01:21:58,560 --> 01:21:59,891
He's rich!

771
01:22:14,606 --> 01:22:16,129
Don't worry, I got it!

772
01:22:16,207 --> 01:22:18,505
I got it! I got it!

773
01:23:03,811 --> 01:23:05,278
Dennis!

774
01:23:07,948 --> 01:23:10,472
I've lost the only man I ever loved.

775
01:23:22,192 --> 01:23:24,022
I'll get you out of there.

776
01:23:24,093 --> 01:23:27,995
You shouldn't jump in a river
with handcuffs on, for God's sake!

777
01:23:28,897 --> 01:23:30,489
You could drown.

778
01:23:38,838 --> 01:23:40,863
Hold on. I'm coming.

779
01:23:44,810 --> 01:23:46,209
Hey, mister!

780
01:23:47,478 --> 01:23:50,504
Good thing I know a lot about ropes, huh?

781
01:23:55,652 --> 01:23:57,141
That's my boy!

782
01:23:57,253 --> 01:23:59,915
Mr. Wilson taught me how to tie knots.

783
01:24:00,055 --> 01:24:04,013
When I get you out, I'm going to bed.
I'm beat.

784
01:24:04,958 --> 01:24:07,085
It must be all the fresh air.

785
01:24:10,363 --> 01:24:12,126
Hold on, I'm coming.

786
01:24:21,839 --> 01:24:25,672
There you go. Now just pull yourself in.

787
01:25:14,012 --> 01:25:16,037
This is Mr. Wilson's gold.

788
01:25:17,316 --> 01:25:20,011
- How come you got it?
- I stole it.

789
01:25:20,518 --> 01:25:21,883
You're a robber?

790
01:25:21,953 --> 01:25:23,112
I'm a thief.

791
01:25:25,488 --> 01:25:27,887
Say your prayers, little rat!

792
01:25:28,023 --> 01:25:30,423
I can't. I didn't take my bath yet.

793
01:25:30,492 --> 01:25:32,322
Have it your own way.

794
01:27:46,131 --> 01:27:47,120
Martha!

795
01:27:47,433 --> 01:27:48,422
Mitchell!

796
01:28:00,042 --> 01:28:02,374
Hey, Mr. Wilson!

797
01:28:21,526 --> 01:28:23,083
- Guess what?
- What?

798
01:28:24,995 --> 01:28:26,791
I got your gold back.

799
01:28:28,665 --> 01:28:29,654
Dennis!

800
01:28:32,701 --> 01:28:34,692
Mom! Dad!

801
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:39,701
Oh, sweetheart! Thank God, you're okay.

802
01:28:52,517 --> 01:28:53,711
Help.

803
01:29:13,333 --> 01:29:16,325
This is my buddy. This is my pal.

804
01:29:27,444 --> 01:29:28,433
Wait a minute.

805
01:29:28,545 --> 01:29:32,674
You can tell everybody at the big house
you met our Dennis Mitchell.

806
01:29:35,283 --> 01:29:37,046
All right. Let's wrap it up.

807
01:29:41,088 --> 01:29:42,077
Mister.

808
01:29:43,857 --> 01:29:45,790
You forgot something.

809
01:29:50,896 --> 01:29:51,885
Dennis!

810
01:30:17,716 --> 01:30:20,014
I like that rhubarb pie that Martha makes.

811
01:30:20,085 --> 01:30:22,814
- Wonderful dinner.
- Thank you, Henry.

812
01:30:23,254 --> 01:30:24,983
Alice, your coffee.

813
01:30:27,891 --> 01:30:29,017
Guess what?

814
01:30:29,092 --> 01:30:30,820
I won't have to travel anymore.

815
01:30:30,893 --> 01:30:32,292
That's nice.

816
01:30:32,495 --> 01:30:34,773
They want me to work on the project here.

817
01:30:34,843 --> 01:30:38,406
They agreed to start a daycare center
so I can take Dennis with me to work.

818
01:30:38,481 --> 01:30:40,127
That's ridiculous!

819
01:30:40,762 --> 01:30:43,175
What the heck's he going to do all day?

820
01:30:43,243 --> 01:30:44,856
Don't be foolish.

821
01:30:44,963 --> 01:30:47,996
We're right next door. We can watch him.

822
01:30:49,295 --> 01:30:51,506
Well, of course. We'd love to.

823
01:30:51,577 --> 01:30:53,855
I don't think<i>...</i>

824
01:30:54,025 --> 01:30:58,423
I mean, you must remember back
to all the times Dennis upset you.

825
01:30:59,085 --> 01:31:02,389
This is a new ball game.
I've learned a few things.

826
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:03,641
Kids are kids.

827
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:07,017
You have to play by their rules.

828
01:31:07,386 --> 01:31:09,889
If you can't do that, you're in trouble.

829
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:12,006
You must roll with the punches.

830
01:31:12,082 --> 01:31:14,360
You must expect the unexpected.

831
01:31:39,433 --> 01:31:43,029
Aren't you supposed to be
in the daycare area with the other children?

832
01:31:44,161 --> 01:31:46,372
That's where I was, but I had to leave.

833
01:31:46,509 --> 01:31:48,483
The lady who watches the kids said...

834
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:51,627
...if she had to look at me
for five more seconds...

835
01:31:51,702 --> 01:31:54,475
...she'd jump out the window.

836
01:31:55,439 --> 01:31:57,186
She's a pretty nice lady...

837
01:31:57,390 --> 01:31:59,364
...so I wouldn't want her to do that.

838
01:32:02,384 --> 01:32:04,726
Can I push the button?

839
01:32:04,820 --> 01:32:07,667
No, because you don't know
which button to push.

840
01:32:21,203 --> 01:32:22,768
It's this one!

841
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,076
I'm going to get this little kid!
