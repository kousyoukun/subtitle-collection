00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,660
l'll tell you something, Adrian,
when l went in that was all the go.

154
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,410
What did you do? Life?

155
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,500
You know, Charles,
you could put all these in a museum.

156
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,880
l'll tell you what l'll do with you, Adrian.
l'll tell you what l'll do.

157
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,920
-l'll take this lot now.
-Quite revolting.

158
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,300
l'll take this lot now. You wrap them up.

159
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,840
-And do us a favour, Adrian.
-Yeah.

160
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,890
Shorten the sleeves will you, love?
l'm not a gorilla.

161
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,900
Yes. Yes.
Well, there we are, Captain Croker.

162
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,320
l think you'll find
we've kept it in perfect tone.

163
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,910
l'll just run the engine for you, shall l?

164
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,910
You'll be able to hear
what it sounds like.

165
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,420
There we are. How's that?

166
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,170
-l say.
-Yes?

167
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,340
-l say.
-Hello?

168
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,550
There you are.
l thought l'd lost you for a second.

169
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,930
No, l came round here.
l was just thinking,

170
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,850
maybe it needs a little more air...

171
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,680
-Yeah.
-...through the second carburettor.

172
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,890
-Do you think so?
-Yeah, listen. There.

173
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,100
-Yes, maybe you're right.
-Yes.

174
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,480
-Yes. All right, l'll...
-No, l'll do it. Just stay there.

175
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,650
Would you open the bonnet for me,
please?

176
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,360
-Yes.
-Yes, thank you.

177
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,780
-l wonder if you'd hold this for me?
-The...

178
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,660
-The bonnet, yes.
-Yes, of course.

179
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,620
Thank you.

180
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,290
-l didn't quite...
-Yes. There we are.

181
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,880
-Do you want me to just...
-Hold. Thank you very much.

182
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,000
-There we are.
-Now...

183
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,420
-Yes. l can...
-How are you doing?

184
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:17,050
l can see what's wrong.
lt's very, very small.

185
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,550
Maybe... l don't know.
No, it's all right. Leave it. Leave it.

186
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,930
-Shall l...
-Yes, you shut it and l'll lock it all.

187
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,810
Thank you.

188
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,350
How are you doing? All right?

189
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,480
Yes, it's a long time since l was in here.

190
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,820
l dare say. There we are.

191
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,400
l haven't been in this car for so long.

192
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,570
Yes, l gather you've been in lndia
for about two years, sir.

193
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,740
-Yeah, shooting tigers.
-Really? Splendid.

194
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,040
The garage bill, sir.

195
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,630
-Yeah?
-Well, l'm afraid it's £200.

196
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,130
But, of course,
if you insist we can charge it.

197
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,630
No, no. Please, please.

198
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,260
There's a bounty for shooting tigers,
you know?

199
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,380
-Well...
-Yes, it's £50 a head.

200
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,350
-Really? There's no need to pay... l see.
-These are wrapped in bundles of 200.

201
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,270
-Well, there's no need to pay...
-No, that's quite all right.

202
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,650
Yes, you must have shot
an awful lot of tigers, sir.

203
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,860
Yes, l used a machine gun.

204
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,550
<i>CaIIing Mr WiIIiams. Mr R. J. WiIIiams.</i>

205
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,260
<i>Will Mr Williams please come
to reception...</i>

206
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:49,140
-Lord Croker. l am expected.
-Yes, Your Lordship. Suite 602.

207
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,310
And there's a message.

208
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,060
Thank you.

209
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,160
Hello, Charlie.

210
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:10,040
Well, shut the door, Charlie.
You're gonna cause a terrible draught.

211
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,250
Ladies?

212
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,960
Hey, Charlie.

213
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,880
-Hello, Charlie.
-Hi, Charlie.

214
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,760
-Love you, Charlie.
-Ciao, Charlie.

215
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,930
-Nice, Charlie.
-Good to see you, Charlie.

216
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,510
Sweet, Charlie.

217
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,060
Well, l thought, a coming-out present.

218
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,520
Very nice. Very nice.

219
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,810
-Now, what would you like?
-Everything.

220
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,790
-Where's your old man?
-He is dead.

221
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,340
ln the Alps, in a car crash.
lt wasn't an accident.

222
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,220
Well, there goes the job, then.

223
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,060
-Wait, Mr Croker.
-Yes, Mrs Beckerman.

224
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,230
This is for you.

225
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,650
What's this?
Some sort of a consolation prize?

226
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,900
These are all the plans that my husband
didn't have time to complete.

227
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,660
-He wants you to finish them.
-He does, does he?

228
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,950
Tell me, where do you figure

229
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,540
in the plans your husband
didn't have time to complete?

230
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,040
l don't.

231
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,380
l am going to New York
tomorrow morning at 6:00 a.m.

232
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,380
Pity.

233
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:32,470
But that still gives us four hours to kill.

234
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,730
And you still in your widow's weeds.

235
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:08,010
<i>-Charlie Croker, l am dead.
-Hello, Roger.</i>

236
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:12,350
<i>So l have arranged for my widow to
deliver some material to you in England.</i>

237
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,970
Yes, l got it.

238
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,520
<i>There you must find the backing
to do the job.</i>

239
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,480
<i>You must, Charlie,
because it is a work of genius.</i>

240
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,530
<i>Just think of it.</i>

241
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,780
<i>A city in chaos, a smash-and-grab raid</i>

242
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:37,200
<i>and $4 miIIion through a traffic jam.</i>

243
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,500
$4 million?

244
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:50,680
<i>This is the city of Turin,
the industrial capital of ltaly,</i>

245
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,850
<i>the most modern in Europe,
famed for its architecture,</i>

246
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:59,350
<i>and soon, l trust, for
the greatest robbery of the 20th century.</i>

247
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,520
<i>This is the Fiat armoured convoy.</i>

248
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:09,070
<i>lt leaves Turin airport every week.</i>

249
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,030
<i>lt never carries less than $4 million.</i>

250
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,160
l think we could take that over, Roger.

251
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,750
<i>To reach its destination,
the convoy has to travel</i>

252
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,250
<i>through one of the busiest
traffic systems in Europe,</i>

253
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,750
<i>a system which is controlled
by television cameras</i>

254
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:31,680
<i>and by the computer in this building,
the Turin Traffic ControI Centre.</i>

255
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,100
<i>If you can get into this room, CharIie,</i>

256
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,810
<i>you will cause the biggest traffic jam
in the history of the world.</i>

257
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,940
<i>Every street in the city
will be paralysed,</i>

258
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,270
<i>and then you will have a chance
to ambush the convoy.</i>

259
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,730
Very nice.

260
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,070
<i>Now, Charlie,
first you neutralise the TV cameras</i>

261
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,530
<i>which overlook the convoy's route.</i>

262
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:01,460
<i>You do this
with these little gadgets here. Look.</i>

263
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,880
<i>-Yeah.
-Second,</i>

264
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:12,050
<i>you break into the computer building
and substitute this new programme.</i>

265
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,800
<i>-Got it.
-And this causes the jam.</i>

266
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,050
Right.

267
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:23,770
<i>Third, you attack the convoy
in your own inimitabIe way, CharIie.</i>

268
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,480
<i>And fourth, you escape</i>

269
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,940
<i>on the only route out of the city
which is not blocked up with traffic.</i>

270
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,410
<i>You'II find the detaiIs of the route
in this portfolio.</i>

271
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,160
<i>Within just two hours,</i>

272
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,370
<i>you will be over the Alps
and into SwitzerIand.</i>

273
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,290
<i>And within three, you'll have the money
safe and sound in a Geneva bank.</i>

274
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,590
<i>-Make it work, Charlie.
-l will, Roger.</i>

275
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:04,390
$4 million through a traffic jam.

276
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:12,030
Money received from the collection
of Brighton so far is £15,000.

277
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,110
Hello. Camp Freddie?

278
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,570
<i>CharIie Croker.
l thought you were in ltaly.</i>

279
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,200
-l want to see Bridger.
-Mr Bridger to you.

280
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,700
l've got a job.

281
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:28,210
<i>If it's the GPO, City Road,
it's being done next week.</i>

282
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:33,510
Freddie, this job is bigger than anything
Bridger's done up until now.

283
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,720
lf it's the Bank of England, it's out.

284
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,720
Mr Bridger's very worried
about the economy of the country.

285
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,980
Exactly, Freddie.
Now, tell Bridger this is a foreign job

286
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,560
to help with this country's balance
of payments.

287
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,650
Charlie, l don't think
you have the kind of scheme

288
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,190
that yields the size of profit
that Mr Bridger is accustomed to.

289
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,860
But, Freddie, this job is big.

290
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,160
Charlie, you wouldn't even know
how to spell big.

291
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,330
B-l-G. Big.

292
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Now then, Butch Harry,
tell us about Fulham.

293
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,010
Well, now, Fulham,
a bit dodgy at the moment.

294
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,220
How are you?
How do you feel about a little outing?

295
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:26,350
Now l need Hazel.
Hazel, my lovely, out you come.

296
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,390
Come on, then, for me. There you are.

297
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,730
lt's a long time since
you've seen the nightlife, innit, darling?

298
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,320
Wait a minute. Where's my torch?
Where's my bloody torch?

299
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,200
-Good evening, Mr Bridger.
-Croker.

300
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,290
-Mr Bridger, l've got a job lined up.
-Get out of here.

301
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,250
lt's all here,
maps, drawings, plans, everything.

302
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,630
You've been put up to this, haven't you?

303
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:38,710
You've been bribed to upset
my natural rhythm and ruin my health.

304
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,550
No, Mr Bridger.
Mr Bridger, this is important.

305
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,010
$4 million. Europe.

306
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,600
The Common Market.
ltaly, the Fiat car factory.

307
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:52,940
-Croker, this is my toilet.
-Please. Just read it, Mr Bridger.

308
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,940
Get out.

309
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,440
Are you all right, Mr Bridger?
You all right?

310
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,970
He's all right.

311
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,920
l can always take it to the Americans.

312
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,340
They're people
who recognise young talent

313
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,510
and give it a chance, they are.

314
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,920
Last night, Mr Governor,
my toilet was broken into.

315
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,170
-Toilet?
-Toilet.

316
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,720
-Broken into?
-Broken into.

317
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:52,100
Well, l'm terribly sorry.

318
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,980
There are some places, Governor,
which, to an Englishman, are sacred.

319
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:00,150
-Well, l've apologised, Bridger.
-And so you should have.

320
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,070
You are not doing your job properly.
Her Majesty's prison is there

321
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:09,410
not only to keep people from getting out,
but to prevent people from getting in.

322
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,240
You are symptomatic of the lazy,
unimaginative management

323
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,950
which is driving this country
on the rocks!

324
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,080
-Well, is there anything else?
-No, thank you, Governor.

325
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,260
By the way, Mr Bridger,
did you happen to recognise the man

326
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,470
who so rudely interrupted you?

327
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,970
l've never seen him before in my life.

328
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,400
l want Charlie Croker
given a good going-over.

329
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,820
-Yes, Mr Bridger.
-Get the word out to Camp Freddie.

330
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,530
Yes, Mr Bridger.

331
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:50,360
l don't want him killed.
Just given a good going-over.

332
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,870
l understand exactly what you mean,
Mr Bridger.

333
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,120
Do you, Keats?
That's very imaginative of you.

334
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:59,870
<i>Sir, l've got you the two volumes
of the Anglo-American Trade,</i>

335
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,290
and UK balance of payments,
1966 and '67.

336
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:08,920
<i>And l've also brought you
The lllustrated London News, sir.</i>

337
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,380
For why, Keats, for why?

338
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:14,800
-There's a picture of the queen in it, sir.
-That's good of you.

339
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,430
-Sir?
-Keats.

340
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,060
l often wonder whether one day
you're going to top your career

341
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,360
by doing a job on their house.

342
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,780
You must learn, Keats, there are more
things to life than breaking and entering.

343
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,160
Yes, Mr Bridger.

344
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,870
By the way, while we're on the subject,

345
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:38,620
l notice that some of that young mob
in E Block are not standing to attention

346
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,500
while the national anthem is played
at the end of the nightly TV.

347
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,500
Tell them to do so, otherwise
they will incur my displeasure.

348
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,590
-Yes, Mr Bridger.
-All right, be off with you.

349
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,380
Get that word through to Camp Freddie.

350
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,510
Sir.

351
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,260
Charlie?

352
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:37,430
-Right then, Fred, come on.
-Wait a minute.

353
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,610
Take all your filthy clothes, too.
This is my man, my territory,

354
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,440
and don't come back!

355
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,860
Charlie's been caught on the job.

356
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:56,740
Okay, Charlie. All right, where are you?

357
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:00,540
l know you're in here, Charlie.
There's no use hiding.

358
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,660
Charlie, you had three birds in here.

359
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,670
You didn't seem to mind at the hotel,
did you?

360
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,460
That was your coming-out present.

361
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,670
Yeah, well,
l didn't get a chance to enjoy it.

362
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,420
l didn't get a chance to enjoy it today,
neither.

363
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,050
Coming in here, causing a fracas.

364
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,340
Why don't you even ask me
where l've been, Charlie?

365
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,680
You've been with the law, haven't you?

366
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,220
Yeah, they got me
for taking the ambassador's car,

367
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,680
and they got me
for not even paying the hotel bills.

368
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,430
You deserted me, Charlie.

369
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,810
Don't come here all moody, Lorna.
You know how the game is played.

370
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,520
No, you left me to my fate, Charlie.

371
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,820
Usual one, was it?

372
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,570
Twenty-four hours in a prison.
lt was humiliating.

373
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,400
Yeah, well, how did you get out, then?
How did you get out?

374
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:38,070
Because the ambassador for Pakistan
was a very sweet man.

375
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,570
He was a very sweet man, was he?
Go on.

376
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,700
And the hotel manager was very nice.

377
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,700
Lorna. Lorna, l knew you'd be all right.
l knew you'd be all...

378
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:47,040
Well, it's no thanks to you,
Charlie Croker, l can tell you that.

379
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,340
-Lorna, l was busy, wasn't l?
-So l see.

380
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,420
So l came in here and saw.
l want you out.

381
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,880
-And if you don't think l mean it...
-l was busy doing some work.

382
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,470
...then you're wrong.

383
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:06,480
-Charlie, it's the law, Charlie.
-What'd you tell them?

384
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,810
-Charlie, would l tell them anything?
-Of course you would.

385
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,580
-Morning, lads.
-Hello, Croker.

386
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,000
We've come
with Mr Bridger's compliments.

387
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,040
Sorry it's like this, Charlie.

388
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,630
Now, listen, lads...

389
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:41,470
You wouldn't hit a fellow
with no trousers on, would you?

390
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,510
Okay, then, put them on.

391
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,730
Get away from me!

392
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,050
-Have you seen Croker?
-Yes, Mr Bridger.

393
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,470
Well, l want you to see him again.

394
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:26,470
l don't think he'll take very kindly to that.

395
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,270
-l'm interested in his scheme.
-But, Mr Bridger...

396
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:35,060
What you fail to realise is, Freddie,
that we have a new objective.

397
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:40,190
The Chinese are giving Fiat
$4 million in gold

398
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,990
as a down payment on a car plant
they're constructing near Peking.

399
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,620
-But Croker...
-Croker can handle it.

400
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,410
He's got everything going for him.

401
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,040
There's even a football match in Turin
the day before the delivery.

402
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,040
England versus ltaly.

403
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,960
So there'll be enough
English supporters wandering about

404
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,760
to cover his movements,
and even to help him, if required.

405
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:04,840
There's only one snag.
We need an expert in computers,

406
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,800
someone to look after the technical end.

407
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,430
Well, the top man in the country
is Professor Peach.

408
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,430
l've seen him on television.

409
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,400
-Tell Croker to get him.
-But how?

410
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,360
Maybe the Professor's not bent.

411
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,570
Camp Freddie,
everybody in the world is bent.

412
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:25,110
Yes, well, my brother's no longer
with us, l'm afraid.

413
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,950
No.

414
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:34,370
-You mean, he's...
-No, no, no. Nothing like that.

415
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,880
Well, actually, he's in a home.

416
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,840
Yes. Well, we thought it best.
For his own good, you know?

417
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,840
Was it serious, Miss Peach?

418
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,100
-Pam.
-Serious, was it?

419
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,430
-What?
-Your brother. ln the home.

420
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,480
Yes, l'm afraid
it was quite serious, dear.

421
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,110
-lsn't this greenfly awful?
-Yes.

422
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:04,950
Yes, well,
not to put a too fine point to it,

423
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:08,320
he was discovered in the lounge.

424
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,500
-Doing what, Miss Peach?
-Where?

425
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,960
-ln the lounge.
-Oh, yes, he was doing it. Yes.

426
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,840
What?

427
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,970
Something quite obscene with Annette.

428
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:34,980
-A net?
-Annette. She was terrified, of course.

429
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:39,560
-Naturally.
-Yes, well. Would you like some tea?

430
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,530
Tea. Would you like some?

431
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,570
-You're very kind. Yes, please.
-Good.

432
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,660
Excuse me a minute.

433
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,290
Annette?

434
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:56,080
Annette, would you like to serve tea
in the lounge, dear?

435
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:02,550
l shouldn't let her do that, dear.
That gives them ideas.

436
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,470
This is Annette.

437
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:16,270
Professor Peach,
do you see what l'm getting at?

438
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,650
Your brawn, my brain.
l'm not stupid, you know.

439
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:25,740
lt's cooperation, isn't it?
Like that flagpole out there.

440
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,030
-Flagpole?
-The flagpole in the yard.

441
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,830
l mean, l know
if there was a convex mirror up there,

442
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,750
27 degrees vertical,
42 degrees horizontal,

443
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:40,670
l could see
straight into Matron's bedroom.

444
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,880
Of course, somebody else
would have to be up the pole to fix it.

445
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,710
l couldn't do it meself.

446
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,800
lt's cooperation, you see?
She's a big woman, you know?

447
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,390
Here, wait till you see them ltalian birds.

448
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:55,390
-Are they big? l like them big.
-They're enormous.

449
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:58,350
-Really?
-Very, very, very big.

450
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,560
Would we wear stockings
over our heads?

451
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:04,730
-No need for you to.
-l'd like that.

452
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,030
l could steal one of Matron's, couldn't l?

453
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,530
We'll have you out of here in no time.

454
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,910
Of course, l wouldn't want
to get Matron into trouble.

455
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:16,740
Not that way, anyway. She's big. Big.

456
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,870
Look out the window, Professor.

457
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,870
-Do what?
-Look out the window at my car.

458
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,580
-Come on.
-Car?

459
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,290
-What car?
-Down there.

460
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,020
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Please, gentlemen. Please.

461
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:46,690
We are about to do a job in ltaly,

462
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,110
and l would like to introduce you all
to each other.

463
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:54,070
First, Bill Bailey.
He'll be my number two.

464
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,080
Now, you all know Bill.
He's just done three years in Parkhurst.

465
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,410
He's as honest as the day is long,
and you can trust him.

466
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,540
Second, the getaway.
This will be done in three Mini Coopers.

467
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:10,670
And they will be driven by Chris,
Tony and Dominic.

468
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,090
Hello, chaps.

469
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,430
-Hello.
-Hello.

470
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,430
All right, all right, all right, all right.

471
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,310
These chinless wonders
will get you out of Turin

472
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:20,140
faster than anyone else on four wheels.

473
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,350
Remember that.

474
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,270
When we get to the Alps,
we will transfer to a coach.

475
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,570
The coach will be driven
by William here,

476
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,780
better known as Big William,
for very obvious reasons.

477
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,530
Now we come to the professor here.

478
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:42,660
The professor is in charge of all matters
relating to the Turin computer.

479
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:47,290
So l don't want anyone putting him down
because he's a man of reading.

480
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:53,090
l know he's got some very funny habits,
but make him feel at home.

481
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,930
He's very important to the operation.

482
00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:01,390
Finally, and very quickly, l would like
to introduce you to all the lads

483
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,390
who are going to do the job with me.

484
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:10,400
Arthur, Frank, Rozzer, Coco, Yellow,

485
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,400
Camp Freddie you all know.

486
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:20,910
Roger, Dave and Lorna
will be in reserve with three fast cars

487
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,870
in case anything goes wrong.

488
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,080
Right?

489
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,170
Now, it's a very difficult job

490
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:32,670
and the only way to get through it is,
we all work together as a team.

491
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,510
And that means you do everything l say.

492
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,260
Here's Charlie.

493
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,270
Charlie.

494
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,530
Putting the jib on.

495
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,490
Well,
don't just stand there doing nothing.

496
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,320
-Get on with something.
-l am, Charlie. l'm seeing...

497
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,200
Well, get on with it, then.

498
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,700
Rozzer?

499
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,240
Rozzer's having trouble
with his differential there.

500
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,790
-Tell him to hurry up.
-Hurry up.

501
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,120
Dippers for the Continent.
Just changing the...

502
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,210
-The other way round.
-Right.

503
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,090
-Are they quartz-iodide?
-Yeah, that's right, governor.

504
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,550
All right.

505
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,970
We couldn't afford the gold yet,
so we're using lead, Charlie.

506
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,880
Will it take the weight?

507
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,010
-Take the weight.
-Yeah, all right, Charlie.

508
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,970
-Will it take the weight?
-Yeah, yeah, it's all right, Charlie.

509
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,930
Mind your face, Charles.

510
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,390
-How you doing? All right?
-Okay, but l don't like the colour.

511
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,110
lt's beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.
Carry on.

512
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,280
Lorna!

513
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:43,780
Does he really need all this equipment?

514
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,330
He says he does.

515
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:00,970
No.

516
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,180
You're meant to use your brakes, Chris.

517
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,560
Terribly sorry, Charles.

518
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,770
-How many cars have we got left, Bill?
-A couple, Charlie.

519
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,150
Send the next one up.
Let's hope he gets it right.

520
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,710
What do you mean they're written off?

521
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,800
A series of accidents, Mr Bridger.
l promise there'll be no more.

522
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:45,640
Five, four, three,

523
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,560
two, one, go.

524
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:04,370
You're only supposed
to blow the bloody doors off.

525
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:31,520
How's your new house, Fred?

526
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,600
Very nice, Mr Bridger, thank you.
Very nice.

527
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,520
My pleasure.

528
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,550
<i>Beckerman's done his homework
very well.</i>

529
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:08,140
<i>The getaway is possible, but not easy.</i>

530
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,930
<i>For a start, the attack has to be made
in this square</i>

531
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:17,230
<i>and it must be completed
inside of three minutes.</i>

532
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,730
<i>Apart from knocking over
a few old dears with their carrycots,</i>

533
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,860
<i>l think we can manage it.</i>

534
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,490
Now, you all understand
what you've got to do.

535
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,660
Okay? Now, Bill.

536
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,080
Yeah, the transporters will move in here
and here,

537
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:39,500
-and they'll block off the main drag.
-Right. Roger.

538
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:43,050
Arthur and Lorna park
the three fast cars here

539
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,630
in case anything goes wrong and
we gotta make a quick getaway, right?

540
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,300
Correct. Now, it's 12:10.

541
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,930
The bullion van
will be entering the piazza

542
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:54,180
and will be forced slowly
towards the centre.

543
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,900
<i>It's the oId over-and-under routine.</i>

544
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,520
<i>First we go over the traffic
and through the museums</i>

545
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:08,360
<i>and then under again
and up into this church.</i>

546
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,870
<i>The difficulty is here.</i>

547
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:17,120
<i>lf the police can get a car
onto that bridge</i>

548
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:21,790
<i>before we've got across it,
we're done for,</i>

549
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,550
<i>but it's a gamble we've got to take.</i>

550
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,320
Now, the bullion wagon is here.
Right? Dominic.

551
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,070
We get into the Minis behind the piazza.

552
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,530
Right. Arthur.

553
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,830
We drive the Land Rover
into the square.

554
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:58,330
-Piazza, Arthur. Piazza.
-Sorry, Charlie. Piazza.

555
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:03,250
-Now, the Land Rover is in the piazza.
-And we come in right behind target.

556
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,090
That's it. Wallop.

557
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,300
<i>But since the bridge
will be blocked by traffic,</i>

558
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,390
<i>the only possible way out
is across the weir,</i>

559
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,970
<i>which runs along
by the side of the bridge.</i>

560
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,100
<i>l've only one comment to make
about that, Mr Bridger.</i>

561
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,310
<i>Good Iuck.</i>

562
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:49,300
Keats,
l think we'd better arrange a funeral.

563
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,870
-All ready to go, Croker?
-Yes, Mr Bridger.

564
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,160
The plans have been worked out
to the last detail?

565
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,040
Yes, Mr Bridger.

566
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,960
-Everything taken care of?
-Yes, Mr Bridger.

567
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,080
Well, Croker,
you've overlooked one thing.

568
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:29,250
The Mafia. They'll be waiting for you.

569
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,850
ln every shot of Camp Freddie's film
there's a Mafia man.

570
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:40,180
lf they were on to Beckerman,
they'll be on to us.

571
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,480
You're not thinking of calling it off?

572
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,020
As long as you know
what you're taking on, Croker.

573
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,820
-Yes, the Mafia.
-Yes, the Mafia.

574
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:57,070
Croker, you are about to take
a half a ton of gold,

575
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,780
in broad daylight,
from under their noses.

576
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:02,120
They won't take kindly to that.
That's why they killed Beckerman.

577
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:07,790
-lt's a question of prestige, is it?
-Yes, Croker, it's a question of prestige.

578
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,170
lf you go through with this,
you've got to win.

579
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,470
lf you muck it up,
don't ever think of coming back here,

580
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,470
except in your coffin.

581
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,350
We're ready now to start the service.

582
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,780
Who's that lot over there?

583
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:36,990
The drivers.

584
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:40,080
They're the lot
that smashed up my cars.

585
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,290
Practise makes perfect, Mr Bridger.

586
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:45,120
You pick them, don't you?

587
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:51,340
-Mr Bridger will now say a few words.
-What?

588
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,130
Your speech, sir.

589
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:10,060
We have come here to pay our respects
to Great Aunt Nellie.

590
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,280
She brought us up properly
and taught us loyalty.

591
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,490
l want you to remember that
during these next few days.

592
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:22,620
l also want you to remember

593
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,870
that if you don't come back
with the goods,

594
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,040
Nellie here will turn in her grave

595
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,130
and, likely as not,

596
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:34,170
jump right out of it
and kick your teeth in.

597
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,000
Dave, take the valley road to Turin,
okay?

598
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,420
Go.

599
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,340
You three take the Minis
along the B road

600
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,930
and keep the speed down, okay?

601
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,800
Right, there you go.
Go on, away you go.

602
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,760
Freddie, stay with the bus.

603
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,140
Big William,
take the bus along the main road.

604
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,020
Go. Go.

605
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:32,770
You lot, stay with me.
We're going out the mountain route.

606
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,940
Where's Peach?

607
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,690
Hey, what do you think this is?
A Sunday school outing?

608
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,360
Pity people aren't as lovely as flowers,
isn't it?

609
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:45,700
Take your flowers and get in the car.
Come on.

610
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,910
Hurry up.

611
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,640
-Mr Croker?
-That's right.

612
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:56,980
Six weeks ago, a friend of yours
met with an accident on this very road.

613
00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:02,320
-So?
-Do you mind if l show you how?

614
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:04,650
No.

615
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:43,110
-You just lost him his insurance bonus.
-lt cost Beckerman his life.

616
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,740
Listen, the gold arrives tomorrow,

617
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:53,040
and you think you can pick it up like a
bunch of groceries in the supermarket?

618
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:57,500
Just how are you going to do it?

619
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:00,040
Excuse me.

620
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:17,520
Does Mr Bridger think he can
take over Europe from a prison cell?

621
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,650
Your car?

622
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:28,160
Yeah.

623
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:42,460
Pretty car.

624
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,680
Paid for?

625
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:36,770
Very funny.

626
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:47,610
Hey!

627
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,450
You'll be making a grave error
if you kill us.

628
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:03,580
There are a quarter of a million ltalians
in Britain,

629
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:06,710
and they'll be made to suffer.

630
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,340
Every restaurant, café,
ice-cream parlour,

631
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,840
gambling den and nightclub

632
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:19,470
in London, Liverpool and Glasgow,
will be smashed.

633
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:26,150
Mr Bridger will drive them into the sea.

634
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:41,040
Well, gentlemen,
it's a long walk back to England,

635
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,540
and it's that way.

636
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:46,170
Good morning.

637
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,190
May l salute our American cousins,

638
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,700
Signor Francesco Cosca
and his lovely wife?

639
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,240
And may l raise my glass

640
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:22,580
to SignorAltabani
and his most beautiful wife

641
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,910
to thank him for his hospitality?

642
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:31,380
And to congratulate him on the way he
handled the English mob this morning.

643
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:36,220
l would not be too sure
about the English, cousin.

644
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,090
They wouldn't dare.

645
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,560
They are not so stupid as they look.

646
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,130
Candles. Quickly.

647
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:22,430
Gentlemen,
we must assume they are here.

648
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:16,190
<i>All passengers proceed
to gate number five for departure.</i>

649
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:17,440
<i>Thank you.</i>

650
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:25,030
-Got your passport?
-l don't know. l think so.

651
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:27,490
Well, you need your passport
directly after the tickets. Understand?

652
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:31,370
Now, as you walk out to the plane,
look neither to the right nor to the left.

653
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:35,160
Just look straight ahead, okay?
Just keep going straight ahead.

654
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,370
Geneva, please.

655
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:40,130
You all right? You got it?
Neither to the right nor to the left.

656
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:43,630
-Left, straight ahead.
-Look straight ahead and keep going.

657
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,570
Charlie, listen.
The plan was that we stay here.

658
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:02,320
The plan's changed.

659
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,030
-But why, Charlie, why?
-Because you're a liability.

660
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:32,390
Lorna, you see that lot out there?

661
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:37,310
lf we slip up, they'll tear us apart.

662
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:44,820
And l don't want you involved any more.

663
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,950
-Charlie?
-What?

664
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:52,080
You care?

665
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:57,710
Get on the plane. l'll see you in Geneva,

666
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,130
and have a cup of tea ready.

667
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,010
Bye-bye, Charlie.

668
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,640
Get on the plane. Get on the plane.

669
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,220
l love you, Charlie.

670
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:54,970
-Hello, Charlie.
-Hello, lads.

671
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,520
-Hello, Charles.
-Hello, Chris.

672
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,060
-Before we leave, Bill?
-Yes, Charles?

673
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:02,020
l want every one of those tins burned.

674
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,770
l don't want any fingerprints
on anything in the house.

675
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:07,650
-We're all wearing our gloves, Charlie.
-Yeah, but you can't be too careful.

676
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,820
-ls there a toilet here?
-lf you can call it that. lt's out the back.

677
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,030
Yeah, well,
wash the handle and the seat.

678
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,740
l don't want any prints on that, either.

679
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:20,200
Right, here is the crunch.

680
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,710
Do you all know how to get there?

681
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:25,540
Actually, we can all read maps, Charles.

682
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:30,170
The map will be in your head, Chris.
l'm burning this one. Any questions?

683
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:34,050
Now we've lost the two Jags
and the Aston,

684
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,100
what happens if anything
does go wrong?

685
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,970
Put your gloves on.

686
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,310
Anything else?

687
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:44,060
-Shall we synchronise our watches?
-Nuts to your watches.

688
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:48,980
You just be there by quarter to and
don't get stuck in the traffic jam neither.

689
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:51,190
Anything else?

690
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:53,780
Right, away you go.

691
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:59,790
One more thing. Just remember this,

692
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:03,500
in this country
they drive on the wrong side of the road.

693
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:18,680
-Bill?
-Yes, Charlie?

694
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,430
-Bill?
-Yes, Charlie?

695
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,600
-Burn this for me, will you?
-Yes, Charlie.

696
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,610
-Bill?
-Yes, Charlie?

697
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:32,860
-Get rid of this lot.
-Yes, Charlie.

698
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:27,580
They're in a trattoria in the city.

699
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,880
They know where to put these, do they?

700
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,920
Yes, you can see the cameras
on the rooftops.

701
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,340
-l can't argue...
-l am going in the front.

702
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:23,430
You are going in the back.

703
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:25,890
He says he wants to sit up in front
with the driver.

704
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:27,100
l always get sick in the back.

705
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:30,390
Listen, if l go in the back l'll get
me migraine, l'll be out like a light.

706
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,940
You... You are not gonna be sick.
You're not gonna have your migraine,

707
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:37,820
and everybody is gonna sit
in the back of the motor.

708
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:41,280
Charlie, me in the back of the motor,
with my asthma?

709
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:51,500
One more word out of you, Arthur...
All right?

710
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:58,050
All right. Right.
Now, everybody, all your gear in here.

711
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:59,260
Come on, get your gear out.

712
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:03,340
Pens, wallets, passports,
photographs of your girlfriend.

713
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:05,430
l want those cards, as well.
Put them in here.

714
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:07,680
But l'm going to need these cards,
Charlie.

715
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,850
What do you mean you're gonna
need the... Put them in here!

716
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:13,600
l want mascots, money, bottle openers.

717
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:15,770
-...in London l was...
-Arthur!

718
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:19,360
...and the game was up.
All l had to do, all the time...

719
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,650
What?

720
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:27,540
-l'm getting in a contact, Charlie.
-Let's hear it. Turn it up.

721
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,200
l'll turn it up.

722
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:38,960
-How about that?
-How about what?

723
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:44,720
-How about what?
-They've finished loading the gold.

724
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:48,510
Right, get dressed.

725
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,440
Right, away you go.

726
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,070
Away you go.

727
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:35,450
<i>Molto bene, Dad.</i>

728
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:53,680
Okay, let's go.

729
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:40,140
Can you direct me
to Corso Garibaldi Street?

730
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,070
Bloody foreigners.

731
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:54,700
Excuse me.

732
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,590
Blimey. Bloody Grand Prix.

733
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:06,370
-What the devil is happening?
-lt's another traffic jam.

734
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:09,710
-lt gets worse every time.
-We've lost the convoy.

735
01:08:44,530 --> 01:08:45,740
Any minute now.

736
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:48,120
lt's like the Black Hole of Calcutta
in here.

737
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,790
Shut it, Arthur.

738
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,000
-What are they gabbling about, Franco?
-Complaining about the traffic jam.

739
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,210
Yeah? They'll have something else
to complain about in a minute.

740
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,730
-Keep calm.
-Get off my feet, will you?

741
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:17,730
All right! All right! All right!

742
01:09:18,610 --> 01:09:21,820
Get yourselves sorted out and shut up!

743
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:24,530
No one talks any more, except me.

744
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:42,010
Now! Now! Now! Now! Get in front of it!

745
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,270
Right, put your helmets on.

746
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:52,080
Hold tight.

747
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:57,330
Now. Go. Go round. Get in front of it!

748
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:28,900
Put that bloody water cannon out.

749
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:54,890
Okay, Bill.

750
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,770
ln you come. ln you come.

751
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:42,270
Back! Back! Back!

752
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:45,770
Hey! Unload! Unload! Unload!

753
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,350
Where do you think you're going?
Don't just stand there!

754
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:03,770
Get on with it! Get on with it!

755
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,100
Get in the car. Just get back up there.
Get back up there.

756
01:14:07,190 --> 01:14:09,860
lf anybody comes through there,
hit them.

757
01:14:10,270 --> 01:14:12,480
Get up there. Right.

758
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:44,680
Okay, Charlie, that's it.

759
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:47,270
Right. You, you, you in the Dormobile.

760
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:48,650
Get in the car.

761
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:50,900
Get in the Dormobile.

762
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:02,330
Charlie, get your finger out, will you?

763
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,880
Come on, let's go. Get a move on, then!

764
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:58,800
Well, look happy, you stupid bastards.

765
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,720
We won, didn't we?

766
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:08,140
They went thataway.

767
01:16:38,670 --> 01:16:39,840
l could eat a horse.

768
01:18:49,010 --> 01:18:50,350
Good luck.

769
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:30,190
Try putting your foot down, Tony.
They're really getting rather close.

770
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:58,380
Look out, look out, look out, look out.

771
01:22:58,470 --> 01:22:59,680
lt's Charlie. lt's Charlie. lt's Charlie.

772
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:02,850
Now, as you go around,
look for that bloody exit.

773
01:23:02,930 --> 01:23:04,430
We can't go round here all night.

774
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:29,370
-Manzo?
-Yes, sir.

775
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:32,000
Check the railway station, all trains.

776
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:34,050
Check all names of passengers

777
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:37,090
who boarded aeroplanes
at Linate or Malpensa.

778
01:23:37,170 --> 01:23:38,880
This was a big operation.

779
01:23:38,970 --> 01:23:42,510
Those who were engaged in the earlier
part will already have left the town,

780
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,850
-probably by air.
-Yes, sir.

781
01:23:43,930 --> 01:23:46,350
-Check the autostradas.
-But the police will be doing this.

782
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:49,190
We know who they are, the police don't.
Also, have my plane made ready.

783
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:51,020
-Yes, sir.
-They can't get out.

784
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:52,440
Nothing can move in this mess.

785
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:55,320
lf they planned this jam,
they must have planned a way out.

786
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:11,460
l think you might make an effort
to keep up with the others, Tony.

787
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:12,540
All right. All right.

788
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,130
Here, make a wish.

789
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:21,180
Look out. They're behind us.

790
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:23,300
You better put your foot down,
we'll lose them easy.

791
01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:28,890
Hurry up, Dominic.

792
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:12,180
Let's go.

793
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:16,560
Have you heard the news, sir?
They've done it, Mr Bridger.

794
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:19,730
All the men are yelling for you, sir.
They've done it.

795
01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:22,320
-Done what, Keats?
-The job, sir.

796
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:44,000
-England!
-England!

797
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:48,050
-England!
-England!

798
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:52,180
-England!
-England!

799
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:56,020
-England!
-England!

800
01:28:45,730 --> 01:28:48,820
Get the wheels in line.
Get the wheels in line with it,

801
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:51,200
and then slam your brakes,
or we'll be in the cabin.

802
01:28:56,740 --> 01:28:59,700
You should've used more speed
on the up, accelerate and...

803
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:07,750
-Bridger!
-Bridger!

804
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:11,970
-Bridger!
-Bridger!

805
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:25,100
That's it. Go on now.

806
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:29,400
-Bridger!
-Bridger!

807
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:32,900
-Bridger!
-Bridger!

808
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:43,460
Okay, hang on.

809
01:29:54,130 --> 01:29:55,890
-Be very careful.
-Okay.

810
01:29:59,930 --> 01:30:01,600
-Bridger!
-Bridger!

811
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:06,900
Right, everybody out.
Start unloading the gold.

812
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:27,830
-Bridger!
-Bridger!

813
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:46,940
-Bridger!
-Bridger!

814
01:31:03,950 --> 01:31:05,450
-Bridger!
-Bridger!

815
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:32,570
Charlie boy?

816
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:39,240
Now!

817
01:31:56,630 --> 01:31:58,170
Ready, Charlie?

818
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:04,760
Now!

819
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:32,120
Ready?

820
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:36,550
Now!

821
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:06,910
Okay, out. Out you come.
Out you come.

822
01:33:06,990 --> 01:33:10,250
Leave the beer. Leave the beer. Get in.

823
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:12,920
Come on.

824
01:33:14,210 --> 01:33:15,920
Okay, William, go!

825
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:41,250
Hold still. Hold still. Hold still. Hold still.

826
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:46,760
Nobody move.

827
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:03,610
We're balancing right on the edge.

828
01:35:03,690 --> 01:35:07,570
Very slowly, move this way.

829
01:35:08,950 --> 01:35:11,740
Very slowly.
Don't make a sharp movement.

830
01:35:12,830 --> 01:35:15,620
Come as far up this end as you can get.

831
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:41,150
Watch it. Watch it. Watch it, Bill.

832
01:35:50,490 --> 01:35:54,790
The gold is pulling it over the edge.
We'll have to get it back.

833
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:17,850
Get back! Get back!

834
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:28,360
Now hold still. Don't move.
Don't move at all.

835
01:36:32,950 --> 01:36:37,950
Don't no one get out the door, neither.
Otherwise we'll all go.

836
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:03,060
Edge back as far as you can go

837
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:07,230
to counterbalance me. Now...

838
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:03,790
Hang on a minute, lads.
l've got a great idea.
