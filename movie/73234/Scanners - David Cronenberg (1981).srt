1
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,335
Will you look at that
fellow over there?

2
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:53,395
I've never seen anything
so disgusting in all my life.

3
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,701
I'll tell you something.

4
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,332
He's staring.

5
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,570
I think
he's looking at us.

6
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,712
I think we're
being picked up.

7
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,872
Oh, it's too awful.

8
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,210
Can you believe it?

9
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,513
They can let creatures
like that in here.

10
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,179
I mean, really. It's...

11
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,360
Anne, what's the matter, huh?

12
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:26,405
Anne?

13
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,940
Oh! Oh, help someone, please.

14
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,109
Oh! Please, help.

15
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,013
Damn it!

16
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,317
You're 35 years old, Mr. Vale.

17
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:59,117
Why are you such a derelict?

18
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,184
Such a piece of human junk?

19
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,089
The answer's simple.

20
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,326
You're a scanner,

21
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,562
but you don't realize it,

22
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:14,764
and that has been the source
of all your agony.

23
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,041
But I will show you now

24
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,411
that it can be
a source of great power.

25
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,983
Let them in.

26
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,192
Not much of a place, is it?

27
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,498
Still, didn't pay for it, so...

28
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,241
Hurry up.

29
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,797
Hurry up!

30
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,180
We can talk now.

31
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,530
I would like to scan all of you in this
room one at a time.

32
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:37,362
I, I must remind you that the, uh, scanning
experience is usually a painful one,

33
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,904
sometimes resulting in nosebleeds,

34
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,736
earaches, stomach cramps, nausea.

35
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,743
Sometimes other symptoms
of a similar nature.

36
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,678
There's a doctor present
Dr. Gatineau.

37
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,410
I know that you've all
been prepared for this,

38
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,214
but I thought I'd just
remind you just the same.

39
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,685
Uh, there is
one other thing.

40
00:10:55,755 --> 00:11:00,658
No one is to leave this room
once the demonstration has begun.

41
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,989
At this point I'd like
to call for volunteers.

42
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,867
Anyone. It doesn't matter.

43
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:21,875
Fine.

44
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,554
Just, uh...

45
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,556
Sit right here, please.

46
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,102
Now, I'd, I'd like you to think of
something specific.

47
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,333
Something that will not breach the security
of you organization.

48
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:50,569
And that you will not object to having
disclosed to this group.

49
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,840
- Something, uh, personal, perhaps.
- All right.

50
00:11:54,984 --> 00:11:56,014
Yes, I have something.

51
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,313
- Do I have to close my eyes?
- It doesn't matter.

52
00:11:58,976 --> 00:12:00,485
All right.
Yes, I have something.

53
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:01,851
All right.

54
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,763
Move everybody out! Now!

55
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,027
Call consec leader!

56
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:26,766
I want you to come with me.

57
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:27,739
I didn't do anything.

58
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,368
I said I want you to come with me.

59
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,467
Come on.

60
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,245
Gatineau, come with us.

61
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,785
Down there. Quick!

62
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,690
Move it!

63
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,828
Get down!

64
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,730
Give him a shot of ephemeral.

65
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,767
Come on!

66
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,735
OK.

67
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:57,959
Take it easy.

68
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,793
All we need is to get
stopped by a cop.

69
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,765
Ah, it'd serve'em right.

70
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,735
Why the hell did they have to send us to
the old factory?

71
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:08,330
If this guy's a scanner they don't want him
down at central.

72
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,136
They're afraid of him.

73
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,170
He's a scanner.

74
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,350
Hey, where's security 2?

75
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,885
- He's moving up fast on the left.
- Hey, man, what's happening?

76
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,754
Ray, what the hell's
the matter with you?

77
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,694
You gotta pull back
behind them, man.

78
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,201
Come on!

79
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,062
Ray, I'm gonna kill you
if you don't do it.

80
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,106
Ray!

81
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,744
Oh, my god.

82
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,684
Don't stop! Move it!

83
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,279
No, we got to get'em
out of there!

84
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:08,696
We've got to get in there.

85
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,134
They're charred, man!
You can see them burning.

86
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,500
Let go of me!

87
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,095
Those people are dead!

88
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,141
Get up.

89
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,583
Let's get out of here, man!
Come on!

90
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:27,485
You want to get us killed?

91
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,182
All right. All right. Pipe down!

92
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,908
Last night...

93
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:38,311
We at consec chose to reveal
to the outside world

94
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,517
our work with those...

95
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:44,187
Telepathic curiosities
known as scanners.

96
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,924
The result

97
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,898
6 corpses...

98
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,194
And a substantial loss in credibility for
our organization.

99
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:58,105
So, this morning we have a new director of
internal security,

100
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:02,546
- Mr. Braedon Keller.
- Thank you. Mr. Trevellyan.

101
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:03,911
Gentlemen,

102
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,815
we're in the business
of international security.

103
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,979
We deal in weaponry
and private armories.

104
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:14,685
We do not trade
in fantasy and pipe dreams.

105
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,860
Let us leave the development of dolphins

106
00:18:17,861 --> 00:18:21,427
and freaks as weapons
of espionage to others.

107
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,365
Now, with all due respect

108
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,198
to Dr. Paul Ruth,

109
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,570
I recommend that we drop
our scanner program immediately, sir.

110
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,940
Dr. Ruth, what's your response?

111
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:37,114
Mr. Keller, who composed
our audience last night?

112
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:41,341
We had 25 financial
and political V. I.P. S

113
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,853
from all over north america.

114
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,822
Were these V. I.P. S
carefully screened?

115
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,951
The screening process used
was very sophisticated, yes.

116
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:53,589
And yet an assassin managed
to infiltrate this group.

117
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:56,762
Yes.

118
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,769
And killed 6 of our people.

119
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,099
Yes.

120
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,867
How did he kill them?

121
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,431
We have reason to believe he...

122
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,274
used scanning techniques.

123
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,042
Then do you suggest, Mr. Keller,

124
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:13,983
that this highly-skilled assassin- very
deadly

125
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:18,352
who embarrassed us all in front of the
community we were trying to impress,

126
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,618
was himself a scanner?

127
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,819
We believe so, yes.

128
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,125
That, gentlemen, is my response.

129
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:29,827
The weapons capability
of these, uh, telepathic...

130
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,994
curiosities.

131
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:34,500
Is obvious.

132
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,768
If I may, doctor,

133
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:42,244
your program is based on a list of 236
known scanners,

134
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,441
- is it now?
- It is.

135
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,649
Of that number,

136
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,481
Of that number,

137
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,114
how many are now
working with us?

138
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,351
As of last night, none.

139
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:55,892
Well, then.

140
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:59,124
We don't even have
a program to drop, do we?

141
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,792
It shouldn't be
very painful for anyone.

142
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:06,201
Consec surveillance has gradually lost
contact with all the names on our list,

143
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,138
and I submit that this...
this is not an accident.

144
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,301
I think we've lost them
to a program

145
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,310
far in advance of ours.

146
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,538
What?

147
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:15,602
I can't believe it.

148
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,774
I think you might
elaborate, Dr. Ruth.

149
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,682
In my study of the situation
I've come to the conclusion

150
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,084
That there is
a scanner underground

151
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,918
Developed in north america.

152
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,515
It has an organization
that's well-motivated,

153
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:28,651
and it has a leader.

154
00:20:28,652 --> 00:20:29,927
Now, that's ridiculous, doctor.

155
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:34,365
You can't get 2 of them to sit in the same
room together without going berserk.

156
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:39,063
You're making a very
provocative allegation, Dr. Ruth.

157
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,866
Who controls this group?

158
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,999
If you study the descriptions
in this report,

159
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,739
You will find that you
probably met him last night.

160
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:52,047
His name is Darryl Revok,

161
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:53,607
and he was on our list.

162
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,381
This is total fiction.
Mr. Trevellyan, I...

163
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,752
A moment, Mr. Keller.

164
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,791
What do you suggest, doctor?

165
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,160
Eliminate the competition.

166
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,855
How?

167
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,832
Contact a scanner who is as yet
unknown to the underground,

168
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,234
convert him to out cause
and then send him out

169
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,296
to infiltrate the underground.

170
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,569
Convert him, doctor? How?

171
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:21,204
They're all pathetic social misfits.
Unstable. Unreliable.

172
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,717
That is because their unique gifts
are not understood, Mr. Keller.

173
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,878
There is one point about which there is no
doubt at all,

174
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,479
and that is that consec was attacked.

175
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,716
For our own peace of mind,

176
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,124
we have to retaliate in some way,

177
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:39,163
and I think
Dr. Ruth's suggestion

178
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,926
is a very interesting one.

179
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,391
Except that...

180
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:48,400
We don't have ant scanners left
to send into the field.

181
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,103
As a matter of fact,

182
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,235
I do have one,

183
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,475
still unaffiliated.

184
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,314
Very special one.

185
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:15,059
I don't suppose you speak much.

186
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,433
No.

187
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,894
It's not surprising.

188
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,699
With all those other voices in your head
how can your hear your own voice?

189
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:28,007
How can you develop
a self personality?

190
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,771
How do you feel?

191
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,350
I feel...

192
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,284
crystal clear.

193
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,248
How do you like...

194
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,384
clarity?

195
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,190
I'm not sure.

196
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,100
- I think I'm a bit afraid.
- Why?

197
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,069
I feel so exposed.

198
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,676
I can hear myself.

199
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,143
You hear your own voice?

200
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,271
- Yes.
- Good.

201
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:04,474
You called me a scanner.

202
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,941
What is that?

203
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,713
Freak of nature...

204
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:14,816
Born with a certain form of E.S.P.,

205
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,986
a derangement of the synapses

206
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,157
which we call telepathy.

207
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,532
Could be a disease, possibly,

208
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,162
or a result of radiation.

209
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,106
We don't really know why.

210
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:34,802
Who are you?

211
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,945
My name is Dr. Paul Ruth.

212
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:41,281
I'm a psychopharmacist by trade,

213
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,651
specializing in the phenomenon

214
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,519
of scanners.

215
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,297
The woman in the shopping mall.
What were you doing to her?

216
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,993
I wasn't doing anything to her.

217
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,728
It was her.

218
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,571
She was...

219
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,838
forcing me...

220
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,501
To what?

221
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,243
To think about her.

222
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:13,946
The 50 people that were in this room
they appeared to disturb you.

223
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,543
Why was that?

224
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,315
They talked too loud.

225
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,254
They talked, and they talked.

226
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:22,885
Really? I didn't see
their lips move, did you?

227
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,485
No, it was the other voices.

228
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,121
The ones without lips.

229
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,789
They were drowning me.

230
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,131
I couldn't stop them.

231
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,996
The injection I gave you, the needle.

232
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,042
What happened to the voices?

233
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,077
They stopped.

234
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:44,081
The drug is called ephemeral.

235
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,674
It's a scan suppressant.

236
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:49,845
It does nothing when it's given to ordinary
human being.

237
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:51,946
When given to a scanner,

238
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:55,015
it prevents the flow of telepathy.

239
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:58,460
It stops the voices.

240
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,157
It can help you.

241
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,359
How do you know these things?

242
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,459
It's my profession.

243
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,487
This is Mr. Keller.

244
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:32,920
Will my car be ready this evening?

245
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,695
Tell us what you did, please, Darryl.

246
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,732
I drilled a hole in my head.

247
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,471
- Where?
- Kind of obvious, isn't it?

248
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:49,679
Right here.

249
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,014
Why did you do it, Darryl?
Why did you drill the hole?

250
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,982
Too much pressure.

251
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,548
Had to release some pressure.

252
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,524
You wanted to let the pressure out?

253
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,959
You wanted to let
something out of your head?

254
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:11,268
Maybe I'm so smart I can't contain the
thoughts in my head.

255
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,634
You wanted to let something
out of your head?

256
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,673
What?

257
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:18,806
People.

258
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,203
There are people in my head.

259
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:24,976
Not enough room for Darryl.

260
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,109
You mean voices?

261
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,085
No. Whole people.

262
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:31,850
Arms, legs, hands.

263
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,289
What's that you've put
over the hole?

264
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,792
It's a door.

265
00:26:35,793 --> 00:26:38,495
Put an eye on the door so they won't know
it's a door and they can't get back in

266
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,623
'cause this is the eye
you know?

267
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,894
Do you think
that will fool them?

268
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:48,167
Sure. Sure it will.

269
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,033
- I mean...
- I mean, sure it will, you know?

270
00:26:51,034 --> 00:26:52,476
I mean, is that
the only way to...

271
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:54,001
No!

272
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,242
What do you know?

273
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,849
You don't know nothing
do you?

274
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,942
What's it like in there
eh, lady?

275
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,782
You want to see
how to get in?

276
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:05,821
Ok?

277
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,079
Come with me, Darryl.

278
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,381
Get your hands off me.

279
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:36,977
Get your hands...

280
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,387
Get your hands off me!

281
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,482
Get your hands off me!

282
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,410
That's me, isn't it?

283
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,414
As you were...

284
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,508
Without ephemeral
without guidance.

285
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,950
Is he still like that?

286
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:13,683
Worse.

287
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,191
How could he be?

288
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,320
At the age of 22
he was extremely self-destructive.

289
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:19,920
Now, at the age of 35,

290
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,990
he is simply destructive.

291
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,969
In many ways, Cameron,

292
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,732
he is your enemy.

293
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:29,773
And mine.

294
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,141
But I don't even know him.

295
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,838
He...

296
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,172
knows you.

297
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:43,514
Somehow he was able
to gather a master list

298
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:46,352
of all the scanners
who were ever born.

299
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,619
He has sought them out
one by one,

300
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:52,356
asked them to join him
in an insane crusade

301
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,126
to destroy the society
that created him.

302
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,199
And me?

303
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,263
He was looking for you
but I found you first.

304
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:01,999
That's why
you can help me.

305
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,802
I don't understand.

306
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,842
All the scanners

307
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,401
who didn't agree to
join him were murdered.

308
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,348
These murders represent
a loss to mankind

309
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,612
of the most spectacular human beings

310
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,314
that ever walked
the face of this planet.

311
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:19,288
Now, you, Cameron,

312
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:20,591
and your brothers and sisters,

313
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,755
can bring a, a glory
and a brilliance

314
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:27,025
to our society that has
never been seen before.

315
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,632
We must stop Revok now.

316
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,677
Consec are not ready
to give up their program.

317
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:26,321
Paul Ruth came up
with a secret weapon.

318
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:27,585
What?

319
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,825
Someone you've been
looking for, I think.

320
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,419
A scanner.

321
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,761
Calls himself Cameron Vale.

322
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,159
I've seen him.

323
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:42,138
And Ruth knew exactly
where to find him.

324
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,673
He's in indoctrination right now.

325
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,347
Can he do anything?
What kind of shape is he in?

326
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,850
He seems to function...

327
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:57,145
But he's nothing to worry about.

328
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,221
He's weak.

329
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,748
Very weak.

330
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:09,026
Welcome to our
little psychic gymnasium.

331
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,926
Cameron Vale...

332
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:18,166
You'll please meet...

333
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:22,304
Yoga master Dieter Tautz.

334
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,344
Mr. Tautz has kindly consented

335
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:32,014
to be your psychic
sparring partner.

336
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:36,891
He has publicly demonstrated
on many occasions

337
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,861
that by the power of his will.

338
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,263
He can control his heart rate,

339
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,801
his alpha-wave rhythm,

340
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:49,738
and many other supposedly uncontrollable
functions of the human body.

341
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,104
Are we ready?

342
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,301
Just about.

343
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,935
Proceed.

344
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:58,642
If you would be kind enough to sit facing
this gentleman here.

345
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,445
I want you...

346
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:10,990
I want you to...

347
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,087
slowly release your scan.

348
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,860
Slowly, with focus.

349
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:21,435
I want it to touch his heart
but not his brain.

350
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,098
You understand?

351
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,707
Telepathy is not mind reading.

352
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,872
It is the direct linking

353
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,678
of 2 nervous systems

354
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,911
separated by space.

355
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,512
I want you to make a link...

356
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,190
from your brain...

357
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:45,556
to his heart.

358
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,231
I want your brain

359
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,199
to make his heart...

360
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,967
beat fast.

361
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:59,807
Now, if his heart
beats too quickly...

362
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:03,836
then he will take over
control of his heart...

363
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:06,647
and slow it down.

364
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,553
Don't worry about it.

365
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:13,146
All you have to do...

366
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,755
is make his heart...

367
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,885
beat...

368
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,451
fast.

369
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:20,496
Fast.

370
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:22,856
Fast.

371
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,200
Now.

372
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:30,270
Fast. Faster.

373
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,774
Fast.

374
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:34,977
Fast.

375
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,513
Fast!

376
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,581
Fast!

377
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,225
End your scan.

378
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,100
End it!

379
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,095
Stop!

380
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,036
Stop him!

381
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,699
End it!

382
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,200
End it!

383
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,061
You were right, Dr. Ruth.

384
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:27,563
It was easy.

385
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,803
This man's name is...

386
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,236
Benjamin Pierce.

387
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:37,831
And these photographs
were taken in a prison

388
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,811
for the criminally insane.

389
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,380
Here's another one.

390
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,476
This is a plaster cast of him

391
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:51,954
at present on display
at the crostic art galley.

392
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,450
He's our only lead,

393
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:56,652
a known scanner

394
00:34:56,727 --> 00:35:00,993
who may or may not be part
of Revok's underground.

395
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,298
Why was he in prison?

396
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,802
He tried to kill his entire family.

397
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,634
His father, sister, mother...

398
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,241
At the age of 10.

399
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,439
It was in 1958.

400
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:20,041
A few years later, he was released.

401
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,275
What do they say here?

402
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:27,191
'Rehabilitation through art.'

403
00:35:58,055 --> 00:35:59,852
The man has incredible power,

404
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,255
doesn't he?

405
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,758
Power?

406
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:05,820
Yes, he does.

407
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,797
I am Arno Crostic.

408
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,629
I'm pleased you came
to my gallery.

409
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,166
Are you an aficionado
of Benjamin Pierce?

410
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:19,073
I'm interested in buying this
piece for my apartment in paris.

411
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:20,235
Yes?

412
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:24,441
But I don't think it'll work out unless I
can get to meet the artist first.

413
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,951
I'm afraid no.

414
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,988
I hope it won't prejudice you
against acquiring this piece,

415
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:36,083
but I would lose
Benjamin Pierce for good

416
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,958
if I even approached him
with the idea.

417
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,227
You see, it's pair
of our agreement.

418
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,860
He will not meet
his public.

419
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:48,701
Maybe you could just
tell me where he lives.

420
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,264
Then I could approach him myself,

421
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,537
and you wouldn't be involved.

422
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,738
I'm afraid I can't.

423
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,750
Then maybe you could just...

424
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,182
think about...

425
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,277
where he lives.

426
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,049
Excuse me.

427
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,152
I'm suddenly...

428
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,693
feeling ill.

429
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,038
Arno, what's the matter?

430
00:37:27,137 --> 00:37:29,079
- Are you all right?
- I will be all right.

431
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,081
Come on, Arno. Let me take you back to your
office.

432
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:34,745
You've got to lie down.
That's it. Take me arm.

433
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,726
Benjamin Pierce?

434
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,323
Why don't you leave me alone?

435
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,302
I need some help.

436
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:10,904
You're the only one
that can give it to me.

437
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,745
Is that right?

438
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,683
Me?

439
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,277
Yes.

440
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:31,797
Then I think you're
in big trouble, chum.

441
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,514
I've heard you know a man
named Darry Revok.

442
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,588
Who are you?

443
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:15,336
I was told you were coming
to pay me a visit, Mr. Vale.

444
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:17,603
How did you know that?

445
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:21,908
Well...

446
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,586
I have friends.

447
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,016
I don't want them...

448
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,661
but I have them.

449
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,264
Scanner friends?

450
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:46,037
What do you mean by that?

451
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,237
I am one of you.

452
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,313
- You're one of me.
- Yes.

453
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,988
You know what I think?

454
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,962
I think you better tell me
what you really want.

455
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:19,342
It's the voices in my head.

456
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,708
They're driving me crazy.

457
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,713
How do you stop them?

458
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,510
Your voices.

459
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,549
My art.

460
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:38,622
My art keeps me sane.

461
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:43,055
My art.

462
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,027
Sane.

463
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,366
I don't have anything like this.

464
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,410
That's why I have
to find Darryl Revok.

465
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:59,343
You...

466
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,543
my friend...

467
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:05,183
are a liar.

468
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:08,523
Get out.

469
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:10,822
Look, I'm not leaving here

470
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:14,058
until you tell me
where I can find Darryl Revok.

471
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:16,865
No?

472
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:18,900
All right.

473
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,937
Well, then I'll get out.

474
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,967
No!

475
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:25,557
Find Revok.

476
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:27,722
Find Revok.

477
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:30,699
These are his robots...

478
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,258
killers.

479
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,203
He'll turn you
into a zombie,

480
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:36,705
a robot,

481
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:37,866
a killer.

482
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:40,808
No, don't you let him.

483
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:43,039
There are others.

484
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:44,842
Other scanners.

485
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,281
Kim Obrist.

486
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,717
Kim Obrist.

487
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,221
Kim Obrist.

488
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,934
Good evening, sir.
Can I help you?

489
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:16,745
Are there any messages for me?

490
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:18,076
Your name, sir?

491
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:19,513
Cameron Vale.

492
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:20,784
Your room number?

493
00:45:20,785 --> 00:45:22,046
802.

494
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,988
Yes, this package is for you, sir.

495
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:24,635
My name is Cameron Vale.

496
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:27,108
I've got to talk to Kim Obrist.

497
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,111
Come on in.

498
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:42,218
Oh, God.

499
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,125
They killed Ben Pierce.

500
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,560
Yes.

501
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,896
Come on upstairs.

502
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,372
Just wait here a sec.

503
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:12,385
Kim, Revoc got to Ben Pierce.
He's dead.

504
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:14,424
This guy's name
is Cameron Vale.

505
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:17,486
I scanned him.
He's for real.

506
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,029
He was there when it happened.

507
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,529
Sit down.

508
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:42,618
I know you.

509
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,150
You were at the gallery.

510
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:48,317
You were looking for Pierce.

511
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:50,360
I need help.

512
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:36,539
Scan together.

513
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:41,168
Scan together and our minds will begin to
flow into each other

514
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:43,644
until they become one.

515
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:46,012
One nervous system.

516
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,176
One soul.

517
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,743
One experience.

518
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,482
Beautiful.

519
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:53,853
Beautiful.

520
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:57,353
And frightening.

521
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,212
So frightening to lose yourself.

522
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:20,340
So frightening
to lose yourself.

523
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:22,749
To lose your will
to the group will.

524
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:24,844
To lose yourself
to the group self.

525
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:26,479
...to the group self.

526
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:36,862
No!

527
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,002
The power.

528
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:46,804
The power we can generate

529
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:50,745
we wheb focus our scans
together is fantastic.

530
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:51,644
Fantastic.

531
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:52,204
Terrifying.

532
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:54,876
Terrifying.
Exhilarating.

533
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,969
No! Aroud the side!
Quick!

534
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:54,635
Hurry!

535
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,377
Get in!

536
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:03,813
Let's go! Come on!

537
00:52:09,697 --> 00:52:10,629
Kim?

538
00:52:11,665 --> 00:52:12,927
Kim?

539
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,366
Kim, come on. Kim!

540
00:52:19,073 --> 00:52:20,597
Now, I know...

541
00:52:21,475 --> 00:52:23,534
What if feesl like
to die.

542
00:52:25,146 --> 00:52:27,444
Everywhere you go,
somebody dies.

543
00:52:27,515 --> 00:52:29,415
Who are you?
Who sent you?

544
00:52:30,484 --> 00:52:33,419
- I'm a scanner.
- Who sent you?

545
00:52:33,487 --> 00:52:35,955
I was found by consec.

546
00:52:36,023 --> 00:52:37,456
Consec?

547
00:52:37,525 --> 00:52:39,652
They wanted me
to find Revok.

548
00:52:39,727 --> 00:52:41,695
I think they want
to kill him,

549
00:52:42,496 --> 00:52:44,862
but they never
told me about you.

550
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:01,841
Tony!

551
00:53:04,185 --> 00:53:05,277
Tony!

552
00:53:45,926 --> 00:53:47,120
Tony.

553
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,095
Oh, no.

554
00:53:54,935 --> 00:53:57,665
Come on.
We got to get out of here.

555
00:54:15,189 --> 00:54:16,486
Come on.

556
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:24,621
What happened?

557
00:54:24,698 --> 00:54:26,188
Excuse me.

558
00:54:27,368 --> 00:54:28,562
Excuse me.

559
00:54:28,802 --> 00:54:30,497
Sir, outside, please.

560
00:54:30,571 --> 00:54:32,129
There's nothing here
to see.

561
00:54:32,206 --> 00:54:33,833
Go back to the street.

562
00:54:37,912 --> 00:54:39,846
Back out. Back out.

563
00:54:48,956 --> 00:54:50,184
Oh, it's on fire!

564
00:54:50,257 --> 00:54:51,952
Let's get out of here.

565
00:54:53,294 --> 00:54:55,319
Let's get out of here,
like, right now.

566
00:55:53,954 --> 00:55:56,047
We'll be all right
here for a while.

567
00:55:57,591 --> 00:55:59,115
It doesn't matter.

568
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,752
It's finished.

569
00:56:02,396 --> 00:56:05,422
And nothing
can stop Revok now.

570
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,327
We were the dream.

571
00:56:08,402 --> 00:56:10,165
And he's the nightmare.

572
00:56:17,811 --> 00:56:19,438
There's still us.

573
00:56:19,513 --> 00:56:21,208
I can help you.

574
00:56:22,082 --> 00:56:24,073
We can destroy Revok together.

575
00:56:24,852 --> 00:56:26,251
You?

576
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:29,086
You're barely human.

577
00:56:37,665 --> 00:56:39,326
I'm sorry.

578
00:56:40,934 --> 00:56:43,926
I'm sorry,
but you don't understand.

579
00:56:44,004 --> 00:56:45,904
You don't know Revok.

580
00:56:45,973 --> 00:56:47,964
You don't know
how evil he is,

581
00:56:48,042 --> 00:56:51,170
how powerful he is.
You don't know anything.

582
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:55,132
What are you doing?

583
00:57:55,843 --> 00:57:58,937
He must have something
that will lead us to Revok.

584
00:57:59,513 --> 00:58:01,572
Us? No, not me.

585
00:58:08,856 --> 00:58:10,289
There it is.

586
00:58:13,227 --> 00:58:14,489
That's it.

587
00:58:15,596 --> 00:58:17,086
That's it.

588
01:01:19,947 --> 01:01:21,676
Dr. Ruth,
telephone call, sir.

589
01:01:21,748 --> 01:01:23,340
Take it right here.

590
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:32,586
Yes.

591
01:01:32,659 --> 01:01:34,456
It's Cameron Vale.

592
01:01:37,264 --> 01:01:38,788
I missed you.

593
01:01:39,533 --> 01:01:41,660
I made a breakthrough
to Revok.

594
01:01:41,735 --> 01:01:43,225
I want to come in.

595
01:01:43,303 --> 01:01:46,136
I want to bring you an
informant from Revok's group.

596
01:01:46,873 --> 01:01:48,465
That's excellent.

597
01:01:48,542 --> 01:01:51,238
I'll arrange for you
to be brought in.

598
01:01:51,945 --> 01:01:55,005
Can you call me back
in about 10 minutes?

599
01:01:55,082 --> 01:01:58,950
Ok. Good-bye,
Dr. Ruth.

600
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:06,350
All set?

601
01:02:07,294 --> 01:02:08,955
10 minutes.

602
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,988
We may have developed
a serious problem.

603
01:02:37,157 --> 01:02:38,021
Vale's coming in.

604
01:02:38,091 --> 01:02:40,150
He says he has an imformant
from your crew.

605
01:02:40,227 --> 01:02:41,922
Now, is that possible?

606
01:02:44,164 --> 01:02:45,859
No, he's lying.

607
01:02:47,401 --> 01:02:49,596
Then why
is he coming in?

608
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:52,104
Maybe he's homesick.

609
01:02:52,172 --> 01:02:54,663
Look, Vale must know something
or his informant does.

610
01:02:54,741 --> 01:02:57,232
It could be
about me and you.

611
01:02:57,310 --> 01:03:00,541
Then you'd better be the one
to interrogate the informant.

612
01:03:00,614 --> 01:03:01,788
And Ruth will talk to Vale.

613
01:03:01,815 --> 01:03:03,749
I won't be able to prevent that.

614
01:03:03,817 --> 01:03:05,512
If Ruth finds out anything,

615
01:03:05,585 --> 01:03:07,246
anything at all...

616
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,878
Kill him.

617
01:03:11,191 --> 01:03:12,488
Really?

618
01:03:14,027 --> 01:03:15,961
- I thought you didn't want...
- Kill him.

619
01:03:16,029 --> 01:03:18,156
Really.

620
01:03:28,341 --> 01:03:31,868
Contact central,
this is contact two-niner.

621
01:03:32,446 --> 01:03:33,229
Contact two-niner,

622
01:03:33,246 --> 01:03:35,612
this is contact central. Security is in
place

623
01:03:35,682 --> 01:03:37,240
and you are clear to land.

624
01:03:37,317 --> 01:03:39,376
Repeat, affirmative to land.

625
01:04:36,643 --> 01:04:39,942
I'm afraid I'm going to have to give you
both and injection of ephemerol.

626
01:04:41,248 --> 01:04:43,580
Well, Braedon, no apologies,

627
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:45,015
no vote of confidence,

628
01:04:45,085 --> 01:04:47,918
and my man brought back the goods.

629
01:04:47,988 --> 01:04:49,353
Why don't we save the party

630
01:04:49,422 --> 01:04:51,447
util we run around
with the president, doctor.

631
01:04:51,525 --> 01:04:52,992
It won't take long.

632
01:04:53,059 --> 01:04:55,619
I have a way
with these creatures.

633
01:04:55,695 --> 01:04:57,890
I know that.

634
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:00,589
So does Trevellyan.

635
01:05:04,204 --> 01:05:06,900
That's why he's asked me
to take the informant.

636
01:05:06,973 --> 01:05:09,271
You can do
what you like with Vale.

637
01:05:09,342 --> 01:05:11,469
Well, that won't work.

638
01:05:11,545 --> 01:05:15,504
Police state tactics
simply won't work. Sir.

639
01:05:15,582 --> 01:05:16,981
Really?

640
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:20,645
Why don't you send a letter
to the board about that, doctor?

641
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,188
I'm sure they'd love
to hear from you.

642
01:05:30,463 --> 01:05:31,760
Come in.

643
01:05:35,502 --> 01:05:36,696
Welcome.

644
01:05:38,004 --> 01:05:39,562
Congratulations.

645
01:05:40,574 --> 01:05:42,439
It's good to have you
back home.

646
01:05:43,109 --> 01:05:44,940
Where's the girl?
She should be here.

647
01:05:45,011 --> 01:05:47,809
She's in another room
being interrogated.

648
01:05:49,216 --> 01:05:50,877
Thought it would be you.

649
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:52,179
So did I.

650
01:05:52,252 --> 01:05:55,517
That's why I made sure that the needles I
gave you both were harmlesss.

651
01:05:55,589 --> 01:05:56,453
Don't worry.

652
01:05:56,523 --> 01:05:59,651
She'll be able to protect
herself if there's any problem.

653
01:05:59,726 --> 01:06:01,626
Why did you do that?

654
01:06:01,695 --> 01:06:05,722
Gesture of trust to you friend.

655
01:06:06,533 --> 01:06:08,330
I have my own methods.

656
01:06:09,369 --> 01:06:11,166
I have nothing to hide.

657
01:06:11,238 --> 01:06:13,638
Nothing at all to hide.

658
01:06:15,675 --> 01:06:17,768
Not even the right program?

659
01:06:18,311 --> 01:06:19,801
The what?

660
01:06:21,748 --> 01:06:25,809
Do you know of a drug laboratory
called biocarbon amalgamate?

661
01:06:25,885 --> 01:06:30,845
Yes, of course.
I founded it in 1942.

662
01:06:32,192 --> 01:06:33,250
You?

663
01:06:33,326 --> 01:06:36,318
Right, I sold it to consec.
That's why I'm here.

664
01:06:36,396 --> 01:06:39,388
Let's say
that we have a, uh...

665
01:06:39,466 --> 01:06:43,027
genial working relationship.

666
01:06:44,638 --> 01:06:46,799
Do you know
what that lab does?

667
01:06:46,873 --> 01:06:49,842
It's been so long
since I've been in touch with them.

668
01:06:49,909 --> 01:06:51,399
As far as I know,
they...

669
01:06:51,478 --> 01:06:56,882
They make some sort of chemical weaponry
among other things.

670
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:59,043
It manufactures ephemerol

671
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:00,609
for Darryl Rovok.

672
01:07:00,687 --> 01:07:04,214
It may even be run
by Darryl Revok.

673
01:07:04,291 --> 01:07:06,452
That's impossible.

674
01:07:07,394 --> 01:07:10,329
No, I was there.

675
01:07:10,397 --> 01:07:13,059
I took the place of
one of Revok's men.

676
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,494
I saw Revok
in the control room.

677
01:07:17,837 --> 01:07:21,238
The production of ephemrol
is computerized.

678
01:07:22,175 --> 01:07:24,109
It's being manufactured

679
01:07:24,177 --> 01:07:26,975
and sent out in huge tankers.

680
01:07:27,714 --> 01:07:30,376
Ephemerol has been sent out?

681
01:07:36,156 --> 01:07:37,987
Sent out where?

682
01:07:39,392 --> 01:07:42,122
The answer is in
you own computer.

683
01:07:42,195 --> 01:07:45,631
The program that controls
everything is called ripe,

684
01:07:45,699 --> 01:07:48,224
and it's a consec program.

685
01:07:50,737 --> 01:07:55,265
That means that someone
here at consec

686
01:07:55,342 --> 01:07:57,037
is a trator

687
01:07:57,610 --> 01:08:01,068
and that someone
is working with Revok.

688
01:08:03,883 --> 01:08:07,216
I want you to access
the ripe program.

689
01:08:07,287 --> 01:08:11,223
I do not have
consec computer clearance.

690
01:08:12,726 --> 01:08:14,318
Neither do I.

691
01:08:14,394 --> 01:08:16,521
But you do have
a nervous system...

692
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:19,258
and so does a computer.

693
01:08:20,633 --> 01:08:24,125
And you can scan the computer

694
01:08:24,204 --> 01:08:28,937
as you would
anothere human being.

695
01:08:32,145 --> 01:08:33,373
Come.

696
01:08:52,065 --> 01:08:53,362
Hello.

697
01:08:54,968 --> 01:08:55,992
Hello.

698
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:00,963
What a pleasant surprise.

699
01:09:04,244 --> 01:09:05,836
You're very attractive.

700
01:09:07,847 --> 01:09:10,941
Ok, let's do it the formal way.

701
01:09:12,419 --> 01:09:15,013
- Your name?
- Kim Obrist.

702
01:09:17,791 --> 01:09:19,281
Your name?

703
01:09:20,593 --> 01:09:22,288
Not relevant.

704
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,192
Now, tell me
everything you know

705
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:32,670
about Darryl Revok's organization.

706
01:09:33,339 --> 01:09:35,398
Before I tell you anything,

707
01:09:36,476 --> 01:09:39,001
I want to know how
you're going to protect me.

708
01:09:40,113 --> 01:09:42,638
When Revok finds out
that I've come here...

709
01:09:44,384 --> 01:09:46,375
He's going to try and kill me.

710
01:09:48,922 --> 01:09:52,255
Miss Obrist,
you best protection...

711
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:57,158
is to tell us everything
we need to know.

712
01:09:57,230 --> 01:09:58,857
As soon as you do,

713
01:09:59,566 --> 01:10:02,899
Revok will cease to be
a threat to anyone.

714
01:10:06,139 --> 01:10:07,697
Not good enough.

715
01:10:09,342 --> 01:10:11,537
Revok's people are everywhere.

716
01:10:13,179 --> 01:10:15,044
And that scares me.

717
01:10:16,483 --> 01:10:18,348
To be honest with you, Kim...

718
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:24,281
The only one you should
be afraid of is me.

719
01:10:25,391 --> 01:10:27,450
Why should I be
afraid of you?

720
01:10:27,527 --> 01:10:30,428
I came here
of my own free will.

721
01:10:38,505 --> 01:10:40,029
Because...

722
01:10:42,275 --> 01:10:45,005
I know you're not
what you say you are.

723
01:10:48,681 --> 01:10:50,672
I want to see someone else.

724
01:10:54,187 --> 01:10:56,587
Listen to me!
Listen to me!

725
01:10:59,125 --> 01:11:02,959
Now, I have acquaintances
in Revok's group. They tell me...

726
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:07,361
They tell me that you have
never been one of them.

727
01:11:09,269 --> 01:11:10,930
Why are you here?

728
01:11:16,676 --> 01:11:18,007
Why?

729
01:11:29,656 --> 01:11:32,819
Good-bye, Kim.

730
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:12,192
It must be Kim.

731
01:12:12,265 --> 01:12:13,630
Where is she?

732
01:12:14,601 --> 01:12:15,727
Where is she?

733
01:12:15,802 --> 01:12:17,269
This is more important.

734
01:12:17,337 --> 01:12:18,770
No!

735
01:12:22,508 --> 01:12:26,842
No, this is more important.

736
01:12:26,913 --> 01:12:29,438
The computer is more important.

737
01:12:29,515 --> 01:12:32,211
Access the ripe program.

738
01:12:32,285 --> 01:12:33,843
More important.

739
01:12:36,356 --> 01:12:39,587
But the ripe program
is the past.

740
01:12:39,659 --> 01:12:45,154
Therefore, to access the ripe program
is to access the past, no?

741
01:12:45,732 --> 01:12:48,530
Access the past.

742
01:12:48,601 --> 01:12:52,332
Access the past.

743
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:56,706
Security!

744
01:13:02,787 --> 01:13:04,516
The scanners,
find them and kill them.

745
01:13:04,517 --> 01:13:05,984
Put it on the air!

746
01:13:08,221 --> 01:13:09,813
Find them and kill them.

747
01:13:18,431 --> 01:13:20,194
Mustn't happen again.

748
01:13:21,634 --> 01:13:24,159
It's always been there
inside me...

749
01:13:24,237 --> 01:13:25,704
Lurking away.

750
01:13:25,772 --> 01:13:29,833
Sucking out my joy and
rotting my successes.

751
01:13:32,011 --> 01:13:36,107
Cameron, oh, Cameron.

752
01:13:36,182 --> 01:13:39,379
I have a way with you,
Cameron.

753
01:13:42,388 --> 01:13:44,515
Mustn't happen again.

754
01:13:46,025 --> 01:13:50,189
Ripe... ripe, indeed.

755
01:13:53,132 --> 01:13:56,260
The ripe program
must be stopped!

756
01:14:02,208 --> 01:14:04,176
This isn't the same
thing, you understand?

757
01:14:04,243 --> 01:14:06,040
Not the same thing at all.

758
01:14:06,112 --> 01:14:08,012
It's different.

759
01:14:09,615 --> 01:14:11,845
First time was an accident.

760
01:14:12,652 --> 01:14:14,552
Fortunate for some...

761
01:14:15,455 --> 01:14:17,787
unfortunate for others.

762
01:14:21,694 --> 01:14:25,721
The ripe program
is cold and cruel.

763
01:14:29,435 --> 01:14:35,135
Very... very cold.

764
01:14:39,846 --> 01:14:41,575
Very cruel.

765
01:15:27,059 --> 01:15:27,957
What happened?

766
01:15:28,027 --> 01:15:29,619
Keller tried to kill me.

767
01:15:29,695 --> 01:15:33,187
Keller?
Then he's the one.

768
01:15:46,345 --> 01:15:47,744
Oh, my god.

769
01:15:57,256 --> 01:16:00,054
Mom,
what are you doing here?

770
01:16:04,864 --> 01:16:06,388
I'm sorry, mom.

771
01:16:07,733 --> 01:16:13,569
Mom, I didn't...
l... I didn't mean it.

772
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:25,441
I didn't mean it, mom.
Please!

773
01:16:26,819 --> 01:16:28,719
There was blood
on my hand.

774
01:16:28,788 --> 01:16:31,120
Secure the computer room!

775
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:32,851
Blood on my hand.

776
01:16:34,861 --> 01:16:36,419
What's going on?

777
01:16:38,264 --> 01:16:40,562
What the hell
is going on?

778
01:16:40,633 --> 01:16:43,966
It's the scanners, sir.
They're out.

779
01:17:09,795 --> 01:17:11,285
Is this the only way
we can do it?

780
01:17:11,364 --> 01:17:13,389
If we don't plug
into the computer now,

781
01:17:13,466 --> 01:17:15,491
they're going
to reprogram it.

782
01:17:36,188 --> 01:17:37,621
What does that mean?

783
01:17:37,622 --> 01:17:40,492
It means that someone has reprogrammed the
computer in such a way

784
01:17:40,493 --> 01:17:42,825
that the ripe program
is locked away inside.

785
01:17:42,895 --> 01:17:45,830
Somebody not only threw away the key. He
plugged the keyhole.

786
01:17:47,633 --> 01:17:49,123
Try it again.

787
01:17:49,201 --> 01:17:50,759
Try it again.

788
01:18:08,254 --> 01:18:10,245
That's as deep into it
as we're going to get.

789
01:18:10,323 --> 01:18:13,952
Hey, Lee, punch up
your internal monitor.

790
01:18:14,026 --> 01:18:17,462
- Access is I M 863.
- Why? What is it?

791
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:21,466
Someone's inside this thing right now.
Getting the ripe program.

792
01:18:34,613 --> 01:18:36,171
How can this happen?

793
01:18:36,749 --> 01:18:38,842
This room is max security.

794
01:18:39,652 --> 01:18:41,711
We're plugged
into the telephone system.

795
01:18:41,787 --> 01:18:45,780
Anybody who has the proper series of access
codes could get in here long distance.

796
01:18:47,623 --> 01:18:49,561
You mean, someone's
getting that right now?

797
01:18:49,562 --> 01:18:50,893
Yeah.

798
01:18:52,932 --> 01:18:54,399
Damn!

799
01:19:33,272 --> 01:19:34,500
It's him.

800
01:19:35,841 --> 01:19:38,469
It's Vale. He's inside.

801
01:19:38,544 --> 01:19:40,444
- Is that possible?
- It's got to be.

802
01:19:42,448 --> 01:19:44,382
It's got to be.
I want to hurt him.

803
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:47,214
How can we hurt him
before he gets out?

804
01:19:47,286 --> 01:19:49,220
Hurt him?
I don't understand.

805
01:19:49,288 --> 01:19:52,917
Vale's nervous system and the computer's
nervous system are joined together.

806
01:19:52,992 --> 01:19:54,584
He's scanning it.

807
01:19:55,361 --> 01:19:57,352
I want to cripple them both.

808
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:59,625
Or maybe kill
them both. How?

809
01:20:02,034 --> 01:20:03,934
I don't know
if it's what you want,

810
01:20:04,003 --> 01:20:07,632
but I could override
the max security self-destruct.

811
01:20:07,633 --> 01:20:09,274
It's designed to blow
all the circuits

812
01:20:09,275 --> 01:20:10,875
in case of anticipated
possession of data

813
01:20:10,876 --> 01:20:13,344
by unauthorized
and unfriendly forces.

814
01:20:13,412 --> 01:20:14,436
Do it now.

815
01:20:14,513 --> 01:20:16,811
But, sir that would entail a total loss of
all data,

816
01:20:16,882 --> 01:20:18,747
all programs within
the consec system.

817
01:20:18,818 --> 01:20:22,083
I couldn't do that without the written
authorization of consec leader.

818
01:20:23,155 --> 01:20:24,679
Mister, this is
your authorization.

819
01:20:24,757 --> 01:20:26,486
Sit down!

820
01:20:33,966 --> 01:20:35,797
Do it now
or I'll kill you.

821
01:20:36,402 --> 01:20:37,733
Yes, sir
I'm doing it now.

822
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:09,668
Sir, I have to finish it
over there.

823
01:21:38,614 --> 01:21:39,864
Sir, this is the last step.

824
01:21:39,865 --> 01:21:41,730
- Are you sure?
- Do it!

825
01:21:57,016 --> 01:21:58,677
There's no need for that.

826
01:21:58,751 --> 01:22:00,412
It's all very quiet.

827
01:22:00,486 --> 01:22:02,283
It's just internal switching.

828
01:22:03,989 --> 01:22:09,427
Really? No one's ever switched
off a scanner before.

829
01:22:53,606 --> 01:22:55,699
Whoa, shit!

830
01:22:58,711 --> 01:23:00,645
See, I told you.

831
01:23:00,713 --> 01:23:01,873
No fireworks!

832
01:25:07,806 --> 01:25:09,398
Hey, I'll go find
the doctor.

833
01:25:09,475 --> 01:25:11,466
All right. I'll keep
an eye on the door.

834
01:25:24,656 --> 01:25:27,989
Excuse me. Do you know if the receptionist
is coming back soon?

835
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:29,994
Yeah, I guess so.

836
01:25:30,062 --> 01:25:31,529
Thanks.

837
01:26:13,405 --> 01:26:15,305
Please, I'll be with you
in a few moments.

838
01:26:15,374 --> 01:26:17,569
I have to talk to you
right now, doctor.

839
01:26:17,643 --> 01:26:19,770
Will you please
get out of here?

840
01:26:22,114 --> 01:26:24,582
It's about this drug,
Dr. Frane.

841
01:26:26,652 --> 01:26:29,849
I understand you've been prescribing it to
some patients.

842
01:26:32,024 --> 01:26:33,082
Excuse me.

843
01:26:33,158 --> 01:26:35,126
I'll be back
in just a moment.

844
01:26:36,895 --> 01:26:39,420
Just relax.
Read a magazine.

845
01:26:47,372 --> 01:26:48,566
Where did you
get this?

846
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:50,267
What do you want
with me?

847
01:26:50,342 --> 01:26:51,673
Who are you?

848
01:26:56,615 --> 01:26:57,980
What happened?

849
01:26:58,784 --> 01:27:00,411
I was scanned.

850
01:27:02,521 --> 01:27:05,581
The woman in the...
in the waiting room.

851
01:27:06,925 --> 01:27:08,586
She scanned you?

852
01:27:09,328 --> 01:27:10,886
No, not her...

853
01:27:12,531 --> 01:27:13,828
Her child.

854
01:27:16,168 --> 01:27:18,728
Her unborn child
scanned me.

855
01:27:21,106 --> 01:27:23,267
That's what
the ripe program is.

856
01:27:23,782 --> 01:27:25,243
The doctors
on the computer list

857
01:27:25,244 --> 01:27:28,407
are giving ephemerol
to there pregnant patients.

858
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:31,677
- I don't understand.
- Ephemerol!

859
01:27:32,351 --> 01:27:35,218
Ephemerol is creating
new scanners.

860
01:27:38,757 --> 01:27:40,554
- Hold still.
- Oh, god!

861
01:27:40,626 --> 01:27:42,526
- Hold still.
- Oh, my god.

862
01:27:44,229 --> 01:27:46,993
Ok, ok, come on.

863
01:27:47,533 --> 01:27:49,091
Let's got out of here.

864
01:27:55,874 --> 01:27:57,967
Come on, you can make it.
Come on!

865
01:28:01,079 --> 01:28:04,537
- Kim! Kim!
- Vale.

866
01:28:30,776 --> 01:28:32,141
Kim.

867
01:28:33,078 --> 01:28:35,069
Sleeping beauty awakes.

868
01:28:36,782 --> 01:28:38,511
Where's kim?

869
01:28:39,918 --> 01:28:41,317
The next room.

870
01:28:41,386 --> 01:28:43,854
She'll be awake
in a few hours.

871
01:28:44,923 --> 01:28:47,118
We don't want anyone
in here with us.

872
01:28:49,127 --> 01:28:51,118
This is just between you and me.

873
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:55,163
Where's your partner Keller?
He should be here.

874
01:28:55,233 --> 01:29:00,136
Keller? Seems he died
when you blew up his computer.

875
01:29:00,205 --> 01:29:02,696
By the way, that was very impressive.

876
01:29:04,343 --> 01:29:08,973
Keller murdered Dr. Ruth.
He deserved to die.

877
01:29:10,349 --> 01:29:12,112
Shouldn't mourn
the good doctor's death.

878
01:29:12,184 --> 01:29:14,209
You should celebrate it with me.

879
01:29:14,286 --> 01:29:16,777
Dr. Ruth was a great man.

880
01:29:16,855 --> 01:29:20,951
He tried to help us.
He helped me.

881
01:29:21,026 --> 01:29:22,926
'Great man.'

882
01:29:22,995 --> 01:29:26,396
There's only one person on earth who ever
tried to help you and that's me.

883
01:29:26,465 --> 01:29:27,762
You?

884
01:29:27,763 --> 01:29:29,400
You sent your soldiers
out to kill me.

885
01:29:29,401 --> 01:29:31,392
Never. Never you.

886
01:29:32,304 --> 01:29:34,534
I've spent years
looking for you.

887
01:29:34,535 --> 01:29:37,041
And then when Keller told me
that Ruth had dressed you up

888
01:29:37,042 --> 01:29:39,806
and sent you out as some
ridiculous amateur spy,

889
01:29:39,878 --> 01:29:45,111
I tried to take care of you
look after you, guide you to me.

890
01:29:47,285 --> 01:29:50,186
Now why would you try to do that?

891
01:29:51,957 --> 01:29:53,515
Who's your mother?

892
01:29:55,727 --> 01:29:57,354
I don't know.

893
01:30:00,732 --> 01:30:02,324
Who's your father?

894
01:30:02,401 --> 01:30:04,028
I don't know.

895
01:30:04,102 --> 01:30:06,570
What was your first
childhood memory?

896
01:30:06,638 --> 01:30:08,401
I don't have any.

897
01:30:08,473 --> 01:30:12,239
No, you don't.
It's no accident that you don't.

898
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:13,868
You were kept on ice.

899
01:30:13,945 --> 01:30:17,813
It wasn't until consec had trouble putting
me away that they thawed you out.

900
01:30:19,117 --> 01:30:24,020
You've been monitored every day of your
life allowed to live like garbage, scum.

901
01:30:24,089 --> 01:30:26,853
He knew where you were
but it wasn't until he needed you

902
01:30:26,925 --> 01:30:29,485
that he reached down and hauled you up out
of the slime.

903
01:30:30,195 --> 01:30:31,492
Who?

904
01:30:32,597 --> 01:30:34,224
Your father...

905
01:30:34,299 --> 01:30:36,529
Dr. Paul Ruth.

906
01:30:41,306 --> 01:30:43,171
Our father.

907
01:30:47,579 --> 01:30:48,978
No.

908
01:30:50,115 --> 01:30:52,140
You're my brother, Cameron...

909
01:30:52,217 --> 01:30:54,515
my kid brother.

910
01:30:55,654 --> 01:30:57,144
No.

911
01:31:04,362 --> 01:31:06,796
Sit down. I want to
show you something.

912
01:31:16,575 --> 01:31:20,477
This was a test campaign used in 1947 to
market a new product.

913
01:31:20,545 --> 01:31:24,003
The product was a drug
a tranquilizer called ephemerol.

914
01:31:25,383 --> 01:31:27,408
It was aimed at
pregnant women.

915
01:31:27,486 --> 01:31:31,354
If it had worked it would have been
marketed all over north america.

916
01:31:31,423 --> 01:31:34,017
But the campaign failed
and the drug failed.

917
01:31:34,092 --> 01:31:38,825
Because it had a side effect on the unborn
children an invisible side effect.

918
01:31:40,665 --> 01:31:42,792
It created scanners.

919
01:31:42,868 --> 01:31:49,000
Yes, the man who invented phemerol was very
excited by this weird mutation it caused.

920
01:31:49,074 --> 01:31:50,769
So was consec.

921
01:31:50,842 --> 01:31:53,640
They offered to finance
his experiments...

922
01:31:54,179 --> 01:31:57,512
so he sold them
his company and himself.

923
01:31:58,984 --> 01:32:01,316
And that man was Dr. Ruth?

924
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,911
That was daddy.

925
01:32:04,856 --> 01:32:07,017
Now I said that the side
effects of ephemerol

926
01:32:07,092 --> 01:32:10,084
were invisible
but that's not completely true.

927
01:32:10,162 --> 01:32:13,791
Daddy could see them.
He could see them in us.

928
01:32:13,865 --> 01:32:18,199
He had given the prototype of ephemerol to
his pregnant wife, our mother

929
01:32:18,270 --> 01:32:21,706
4 years before it hit the market
and then again a year later.

930
01:32:22,507 --> 01:32:24,566
These children turned
out to be difficult

931
01:32:24,643 --> 01:32:27,840
till he realized that the only thing that
would calm them down

932
01:32:27,913 --> 01:32:31,110
was his drug, ephemerol.

933
01:32:32,150 --> 01:32:34,983
That's why we're older
than all the others.

934
01:32:35,754 --> 01:32:39,155
Not only older
more powerful.

935
01:32:39,825 --> 01:32:43,090
The rest of them
they're nothing compared to us.

936
01:32:43,161 --> 01:32:45,686
Then what did you
need Keller for?

937
01:32:45,764 --> 01:32:49,427
Consec had hardware.
It had contacts.

938
01:32:49,501 --> 01:32:52,902
- Keller could see the future.
- The future?

939
01:32:53,572 --> 01:32:55,904
You murdered the future.

940
01:32:58,009 --> 01:33:04,505
That's nagative, Cam. Defeatist.
Disappoints me to hear you talk that way.

941
01:33:04,583 --> 01:33:07,017
You're starting to sound like them.

942
01:33:08,553 --> 01:33:10,161
There's a whole generation of scanner

943
01:33:10,162 --> 01:33:12,292
soldiers just a few months
away from being born.

944
01:33:12,357 --> 01:33:14,985
We'll find them
train them to be like us,

945
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:17,620
Not like an old person
or a band of cripples.

946
01:33:18,730 --> 01:33:21,392
Bring the world of normals
to their knees.

947
01:33:21,466 --> 01:33:25,095
Rule an empire
so brilliant, so glorious

948
01:33:25,170 --> 01:33:27,638
we'll be the envy
of the whole planet.

949
01:33:27,706 --> 01:33:32,166
You sound just like him
like Ruth.

950
01:33:32,244 --> 01:33:34,712
No, not like him.

951
01:33:34,779 --> 01:33:41,981
- Like Revok, Darryl Revok!
- No, like him.

952
01:33:42,053 --> 01:33:45,682
It's as though he's been
reincarnated in you.

953
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:50,194
You're not listening to me.

954
01:33:53,565 --> 01:33:55,590
You're not cooperating, Cam.

955
01:33:56,368 --> 01:33:58,836
You're not cooperating
with me at all.

956
01:34:05,076 --> 01:34:07,408
I've been counting on you
for years, Cam.

957
01:34:07,946 --> 01:34:10,471
Tell me you're not
going to betray me like all the rest.

958
01:34:10,548 --> 01:34:12,379
Tell me you're not.

959
01:34:12,450 --> 01:34:14,475
No!

960
01:34:24,496 --> 01:34:29,365
All right, we're going to do it the scanner
way. I'm going to suck your brain dry.

961
01:34:29,434 --> 01:34:31,800
Everything you are
is going to become me.

962
01:34:31,870 --> 01:34:34,532
You're going to be with me
Cameron, no matter what.

963
01:34:34,606 --> 01:34:38,906
After all, brothers should be close. Don't
you think?

964
01:38:54,032 --> 01:38:55,761
Cameron?

965
01:38:55,833 --> 01:38:57,460
Kim.

966
01:39:03,708 --> 01:39:07,644
It's me, Kim, Cameron.
I'm here.

967
01:39:10,048 --> 01:39:11,675
We've won.

968
01:39:13,718 --> 01:39:15,811
We've won.
