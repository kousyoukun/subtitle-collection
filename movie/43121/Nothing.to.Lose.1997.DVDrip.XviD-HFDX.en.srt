1
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,837
Where do I start?

2
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,477
It's not you.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,275
Well, actually, it is you.

4
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,234
Look, I'm just not--

5
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,113
I'm not attracted
to you any more.

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,957
I need space.

7
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,957
You kinda--

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,671
You kinda gross me out.

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,876
In the beginning, it was different.
In the beginning, you were better.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,312
But then I got to know you
real well, and...

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,193
I-- I came to realize...

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,396
that you're a fat idiot.

13
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,477
-I got ya. I got ya. I got ya. I got ya.
-Okay. Okay.

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,433
- Okay, okay, okay. Let me try it.
- You gotta be straight.

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,791
- Okay.
- Straight face.
- Okay, okay.
- All right.

16
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,189
- I want a divorce.
- Why?

17
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,073
It's a physical thing.

18
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,552
- Physical?
- I've been experimenting
with other men lately.

19
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,229
A lot of other men
and women.

20
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,629
I don't know. I mean, Antonio can do
this thing with his tongue...

21
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,239
and William's stamina
is amazing.

22
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,115
And as far as hands go,
well, your father's hands are--

23
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,315
You are no match.
I have no equal.

24
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,512
Get down here.

25
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,631
If the shoe fits

26
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,638
I want you to wear it
and wear it good

27
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,078
Sulkin' about them times
when I was by myself

28
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,239
I was always lookin'
for somebody else

29
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,638
But as time went on
I had a talk with my mind

30
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,548
Friends like you and you
I gotta leave behind

31
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,798
And I'm sayin' call me a fool
'Cause you only rub it in

32
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,994
- And I'll never see you if I had known
- I'll never see them again

33
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,590
'Cause, well I know the difference
Just stay in my own business

34
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,712
And I'll never, ever
depend on you

35
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,673
Friends and enemies
around me every day

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,952
I can't believe
the things they say

37
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,198
Takin' me for granted
Give me no credit at all

38
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,950
I'll just keep bouncin'
like a bouncin' ball

39
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,875
I don't wanna step
on nobody's foot but

40
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,559
You call me a fool
but you only rub it in

41
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,478
And I'll never see you
if I had known

42
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,511
I'll never see that again

43
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,474
'Cause, well I know the difference
Just stay in my own business

44
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,115
And I'll never, ever
depend on you

45
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,152
B-B-B-Brickman's!
B-B-Brickman's Powerboats!

46
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,919
Get it?
Brickman's sells powerboats.

47
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,511
We make the company mascot
a powerboat. What do you think?

48
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,195
- I like it. Good work, Alan.
- Y es!

49
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,914
- Zachary, you're up.
- All right. I just wanna show you--

50
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,713
- Ladies and gentlemen, Zachary!
- Y es, sir. No--

51
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,274
I haven't taken these to the focus group
yet. I'm still working on that part.

52
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,914
But I just wanted to let you know
these are just preliminary sketches.

53
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,076
Zach.

54
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,273
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing
the new mascot for Hidy Ho Cookies--

55
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,117
Zippy!

56
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,432
What-- What is it?

57
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,551
- Zippy.
- What is Zippy?

58
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,955
- He's a cookie man.
- He's a cookie man?

59
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,036
What is that, uh,
on the ground behind him?

60
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,469
Oh, that's a trail of chocolate chips.
See, wherever Zippy goes...

61
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,909
he leaves this magical trail of
chocolate for all the boys and girls--

62
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,079
Magical? This-- This looks like poop.
It looks like piles of poop.

63
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,079
- It looks like Zippy's walking around,
ju-- just crapping all over the place.
- Stop.

64
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,792
- It looks like--
- No, no. Those are chocolate chips.

65
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,229
- Emma, what do you think it looks like?
- Excrement.

66
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,478
Zach, let's just say
you're about to take a big bite
of a juicy chocolate chip cookie?

67
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,797
What's the last image you want
floating through your head?

68
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,990
- Excrement?
- Excrement. Right.

69
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,237
Listen, I wanna go out on a limb here.
I'm gonna say maybe we should avoid...

70
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,749
all bowel-related items
with this particular product.

71
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,836
- Just a hunch, you know?
- I'll work up something different.

72
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,155
- All right. Thanks.
- Nick Beam's office.

73
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,272
- Oh, hi, Ann.
- Ooh, aah--
- It's your wife.

74
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,119
Everybody out.
Big business deal.

75
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,190
- Hello.
- Now we're still on for tonight.
You stood me up twice, you know?

76
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,356
It's a done deal. New York
Philharmonic. Last night in town.

77
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,471
I'll be escorting
the sexiest woman in the world.

78
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,797
- What about me?
- We'll bring ya.

79
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,912
Oh, guess what? My sister left
a message on the machine.

80
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,076
And she's coming in
with her fiance next Friday.

81
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,519
- No. Oh, wow.
- Y eah!

82
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,074
I finally get to meet the
mysterious queen of the Peace Corps.

83
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,111
Y es, you do.
Hey, can you pick 'em up?

84
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,676
Y eah, sure. When is it?

85
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,836
A week from today.

86
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,111
I think it'll be around 10:30.
I'm not sure. I'll have to check.

87
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,515
PB. wants
to see you A.S.A.P.

88
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,950
Sorry, honey, I gotta go. There's
an onslaught of initials coming at me.

89
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,152
- Okay. Tell him hello.
- I will.

90
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,794
- I hate you.
- Me too. Bye.

91
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,390
- Philip.
- Nick.

92
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,114
Oh, oh!
Bungee jumping. Sunday.

93
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,913
Nick!

94
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,076
- No thanks, Phillip.
- P B.

95
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,918
No thanks, P B.

96
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,828
- Nick?
- P B.?

97
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,315
Okay, okay.
Okay, forget it.

98
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,035
- This guy is new.
- Y eah. What do you think?

99
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,072
Uh, I think he likes me.

100
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,392
Niroog, the fertility god.

101
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,274
Boy, I like looking at this.
Handmade in the Paleolithic period.

102
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,153
Had to sacrifice my ldes of March
gold aureus in trade.

103
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,558
Pity. But, uh,
I think worth it.

104
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,717
So, which one of you
wanted to see me?

105
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,035
- Charles McGinty is coming in at 5:00.
- The Charles McGinty?

106
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,913
- "McGinty Crackers" Charles McGinty?
- The very same.
- Fantastic.

107
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,077
Anyway, I was supposed to have
dinner with McGinty tonight.
I'd love for you to stand in for me.

108
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,589
Oh, no, uh, s-- Phillip,
l-I promised Ann l-I would--

109
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,633
Nick. Oh, Nick.
You gotta help me out here.

110
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,796
I don't get this lucky
every day.

111
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,879
- Look, if this is about a woman--
- You're a pal. I gotta go.

112
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,597
- It just needs to be--
- Guess who just called?

113
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,356
-Ann's divorce lawyer?
-McGinty's secretary. He's rescheduling.

114
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,995
- All right! Y es!
- Want me to get Ann on the line?

115
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,908
No, I'm gonna try to beat her home.
I wanna surprise her.

116
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,270
This is great, huh?

117
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,880
- The wife again?
- No, actually I just met this
incredible brunette on the elevator.

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,436
Well, I'm jealous. What would l
have to do to get flowers all the time?

119
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,518
- You don't get flowers all the time?
- Nope.

120
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,200
That's a crime.

121
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,511
Grab it! Grab it!

122
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,757
That's right. That's right.

123
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,031
Phillip.

124
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,038
Hey, asshole,
get outta the road!

125
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,109
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump,
jump, jump, jump, jump, jump

126
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,754
I say fight, You're outta the corner
a day late, a dollar short

127
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,632
Friday mornings
most people don't get

128
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,756
You change your life from left to right
You get your wit tracks tight

129
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,871
Must be testing the master

130
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,911
The under hood
the underworld's under man

131
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,076
Never mind being understood
Long as we understand

132
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,589
You can't twist transistor
mixing friends

133
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,995
Soldiers over here don't snitch
They bitch and bit

134
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,190
All hours while
the crowds peepin' in

135
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,398
Welcome to hell, bitch.

136
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,317
Car, keys, wallet. Now!

137
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,468
D'you hear what I said?

138
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,591
Okay. Now you listen,
and you listen good.

139
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,429
This is a gun. Okay? Don't be
fuckin' around with no gun, white boy.

140
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,596
Helen Keller,
I'm talkin' to you.

141
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,553
I know you hear
what the fuck I'm sayin' to you.

142
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,273
Boy, did you pick
the wrong guy on the wrong day.

143
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,032
Oh!

144
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,110
Oh, shit.

145
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,357
Oh, you're trying to lock me--
U-U-Unlock the door.

146
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,717
Stop, motherfucker!
Stop the car! Stop the car!

147
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,632
You're driving on the sidewalk,
man! People got to walk there!

148
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,911
Pull over, man!
White boy, I said pull over!

149
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,871
Y o, man, there's a truck.

150
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,753
I said, yo, man,
there's a truck.

151
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,599
Yo, man, there's a truck
right there. Stop!

152
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,754
What about my wallet?
You wanted to rob me, didn't you?

153
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,519
Yes. I distinctly remember
you wanting to rob me.

154
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,437
Here's my wallet.
You want it?

155
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,949
Here it is. Here. Here.
Right out there.

156
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,234
- What you doin', man? That was money.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I got
something else for you.

157
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,352
I'm blind!
I can't see shit.

158
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,474
The honeys dug my eyes.
The honeys loved my eyes.

159
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,072
All right, you win, man. All right?
Is that what you wanna hear? You win.

160
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,236
What the fuck?

161
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,158
No, you ain't one
of them desert slashers, are you?

162
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,149
Cut a person body up and
leave it out in the desert
in little tiny pieces and shit, huh?

163
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,636
Oh, shit!
We are in the fucking desert.

164
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,914
I'm in the car with a psycho,
freaky, Jason hack-killer motherfucker.

165
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,350
Hey, please don't kill me,
freaky Jason.

166
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,552
I said, please don't kill me,
freaky Jason.

167
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,679
I done fucked around and caught
a ride with the wrong white boy!

168
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,158
- Get out.
- With pleasure.

169
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,033
"Sayo-fuckin'-nara," pal.

170
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,517
I can't feel my ass.

171
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,995
My ass just fell asleep.

172
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,315
I didn't even know
an ass could fall asleep!

173
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,113
It's all tingly and shit!

174
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,993
Come on, man.
You can't leave me out here.

175
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,635
Yo, man! You can't
just leave me out here.

176
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,797
Okay, I'll make
a deal with you.

177
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,514
You drive me home, I'll forget
about this whole kidnapping shit.

178
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,712
Oh, come on.

179
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,751
Hello. You tried to rob me.

180
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,556
You had a gun to my head.

181
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,477
Look, I told you
the gun wasn't loaded.

182
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,194
You got yourself into this.

183
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,835
You know what you are? You're
a bad person. You're an armed robber.

184
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,632
Don't expect me
to feel sorry for you.

185
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,320
Excuse me.
Is there a problem here?

186
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,908
- Yes.
- Is this man botherin' you?

187
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,873
- Yes, he is.
- Oh, so you're just gonna come
right at the brother.

188
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,797
Why don't you ask
if he's bothering me?

189
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,957
Lady, for all you know,
I could be Denzel Washington.

190
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,275
Take a good look.

191
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,789
He could be some
celebrity stalker.

192
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,990
I'm gonna have to ask you
to pay for this coffee now...

193
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,031
'cause I've seen these things
escalate before.

194
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,676
No problem. My wallet.

195
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:11,078
Wow! Looks like the celebrity stalker
don't have a wallet.

196
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,795
Oh, well, thank you.
I will get your change, sir.

197
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:24,232
What? You want me to thank you?
So I owe you a buck.

198
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,353
How was you goin' to get gas? You don't
have no money, no credit cards.

199
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,438
No l.D.

200
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,438
Shit, man.

201
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,630
Okay. All right.

202
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,436
You give me money for gas
and I'll take you back.

203
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,313
I'm cool. I'm--
I'm straight.

204
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,113
As a matter of fact, l-- you know,
I like it out here in the desert.

205
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,674
You know, you get
all sweaty and shit.

206
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,396
Just bubbling off your ass.
Just-- What?

207
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,556
I just remembered.

208
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,036
I have a spare credit card
in the side compartment.

209
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,196
Uh-huh, right here!

210
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,392
What's up?

211
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,397
What's up, white boy?
W-W-What's up, huh?

212
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,795
Come on, come on.
What ya got?

213
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,913
Huh? Look at you. You done
fucked around and got dropped.

214
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,317
Get the fuck outta here.

215
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,591
- What?
- You hit like a ole girl, man.

216
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,995
Get the fuck on out of here, man.
Go about your business.

217
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,157
Motherf--

218
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,874
What the hell is this,
your merry-go-round move?

219
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,717
Yo, I understand.

220
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,708
Aha!

221
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,677
Thank you.

222
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,798
Hey. Oh, shit.

223
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,190
I didn't know it was expired.
I never use it.

224
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,877
So why are you out here?

225
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,434
- What do you care?
- I'm curious.

226
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,312
I'm a student
of human nature.

227
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,590
You're a freak
of human nature.

228
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,439
That's all right.
I forgive you.

229
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,552
It's clear you have
woman problems.

230
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,477
You're way off base.

231
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,160
- I'm off base?
- Yeah. Way off base.

232
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,430
- She mess around on you?
- Look.

233
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,030
Even if I wanted to talk about it--
which I don't-- it wouldn't be with you.

234
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,516
You give her some nastiness? I know you
gave her some serious nastiness.

235
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,679
- Just forget it.
- What about him? Did you fuck him up?

236
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,396
Did you whoop his ass? I bet you hit
that motherfucker with a bat, didn't ya?

237
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,478
Kling! Pow! Fucked his ass up,
didn't ya?

238
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,434
No, wait a minute. You capped him. You
capped that motherfucker, didn't you?

239
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,676
That's why you out here
in the desert, ain't ya?

240
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,837
Look. I didn't shoot him. I didn't say
anything to my wife. I just left.

241
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,791
- What do you mean, you just left?
- Just left. I--

242
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,753
I saw them doing you know...

243
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,032
and I walked away.

244
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,829
What a pussy.

245
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,794
No wonder your woman
is sneaking behind your back, man.

246
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,549
Know what your problem is? You don't
have the respect of your woman, man.

247
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,955
That's what it is.
Me, I got all that.

248
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,911
I go home, my dinner's
on the table.

249
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,996
Bam! I don't wanna
hear shit, woman.

250
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,033
- And if I want lovin'-- if I'm
in the mood-- I get that too.
- You're so full of shit.
What would you have done?

251
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,436
Man, I would have went back
to that house and I'd have pulled
a Terminator on the front door.

252
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,269
Boom, boom, boom! Who the fuck do you
think you're playin' with, woman?

253
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,995
Who do you think I am, some fruity pie?
I ain't no fruity pie.

254
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,509
I'm-- I'm Nick Beam.

255
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,437
That's what I told her.
I'm Nick Beam.

256
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,633
And Nick Beam ain't puttin' up
with that bullshit.

257
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,752
She'd have been crying, you know? "Oh,
Nick, oh, Nick, please take me back.

258
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,871
Please, please, Nick.
It was only one time."

259
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,754
I'm gonna "one time" your ass.
Nick Beam is the master of his fate...

260
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,677
the ruler of his destiny.

261
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,509
So if you wanna cry
on somebody's shoulder,
why don't you cry on Superdick?

262
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,074
As for Nick Beam,
I'm fit, lit...

263
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,953
and I damn sure
ain't takin' no shit.

264
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,676
So you can get the fuck out.

265
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,114
That's what I woulda
told the bitch.

266
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,073
That's what l
told the bitch.

267
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,108
- What the--
- Hey, hold it. Hold it.

268
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,549
Break it up. Break it up.
What's goin' on here?

269
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,913
Should I pay cash, or do you
wanna use your credit card?

270
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,037
Ah, fu-- Oh-- Ah--
Oh, shit.

271
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,516
- Put the money in the bag.
Put the money in the fuckin' bag!
- Okay.

272
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,757
- Shit.
- Let's go! Put the money
in the fuckin' bag.

273
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,314
Shit.

274
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,237
You weren't gonna leave
without me, were you?

275
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,432
- What do you think you're doing?
- There's a special they got goin' on.

276
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,950
You get a free stack of cash
with every fill-up. Some luck, huh?

277
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,355
How stupid can you be?

278
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,278
- We better get out of here.
- You take that money back.

279
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,234
- I'm serious, man. We better get goin'.
- We'll get goin' as soon you
bring back that money.

280
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,353
- I'm not bullshittin'! Move out!
- I'm not going anywhere
until you return--

281
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,993
Here we go.

282
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,153
- Why? Why? Why?
- I didn't have any money, man.

283
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,876
- Oh, you had money.
- No. No. That five dollars
I gave the waitress was it.

284
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,118
- What the--
- Oh, great. Buford's come to kill us.

285
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,150
- Persistent hillbilly motherfucker.
- He has every right to be.

286
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,272
You robbed him at gunpoint.
You dick!

287
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,315
Hey, hey, you're the one who threw
the wallet out the fuckin' window.

288
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,715
Smart.

289
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,909
Great!

290
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,552
Oh, shit.

291
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,311
- All right, man. What you doin'?
- Come on, asshole.

292
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,398
Well, would you look
at these crazy sons a bitches?

293
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,954
Oh, shit. We gonna die.
Pull off the fuckin' road.

294
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,594
Man, would you pull
off the fuckin' road!

295
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,234
Oh, shit!

296
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,193
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit.

297
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,790
Hey, Earl.

298
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,511
Oh, sh--

299
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,428
I'm alive! You alive!

300
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,630
How'd you know that hillbilly
was gonna turn first?

301
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,117
You did know he was gonna
turn first, didn't ya?

302
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,232
You know what?
It don't even matter.

303
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,193
I'm alive!
You alive, man!

304
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,474
- Get out!
- What?
- Get out!

305
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,791
What are you even thinking when
you do something like that?

306
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,480
- You think you're never
gonna get caught?
- We didn't get caught.

307
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,114
That's not the point.
It's beetleheaded.

308
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,151
It's-- It's only a matter of time
before you do get caught.

309
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,512
- What is beetleheaded?
- It's a synonym for "stupid."

310
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,634
Oh. Well, here's a synonym
for "procreation." Fuck you!

311
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,469
It's easy for you to point the finger
when you're sittin' on your rich ass
in a big fuckin' house.

312
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,273
- I'm not rich.
- Oh, yeah.

313
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,833
- How big's your TV?
- What?

314
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,076
- I say, how big's your TV?
- Fifty-inch.

315
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,556
- Get in the car.
- Oh, please. Let's not
make this a social issue.

316
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,195
The point is that even
if you wanted to rob a place,
there are smarter ways to do it.

317
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,915
- Enlighten me.
- A mask. Wear a mask.

318
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,076
You see, the police
have this thing called a "lineup..."

319
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,397
and if someone recognizes you,
you go to jail!

320
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,273
Oh, how about this for a novel idea?
Case the place first.

321
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,154
Find out if there's a security camera
or a hidden alarm.

322
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,953
Then again, why even rob
a convenience store?

323
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,196
How much money could you possibly get?
Two, three hundred dollars?

324
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,436
Then what? You're set
for two days! Wow!

325
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,518
- What do you know, lanky?
- I know you go for the big score.

326
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,232
One robbery, you're set.

327
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,591
News flash, big slim.

328
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,676
People with big money,
they protect it.

329
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,633
So you do a little research.
Take Quality Design Group where I work.

330
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,149
My boss keeps a ton of cash
in his vault.

331
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,317
At night, there's only two guards
and a personal security system.

332
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,238
Now, in this case,
I happen to even know the code.

333
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,749
But even if I didn't, l--

334
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,157
What?

335
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,109
I got a booger in my nose?

336
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,713
What?

337
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,796
Diversify.

338
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,195
You can't trust banks, Nick.

339
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,677
The entire system
could crumble at any second.

340
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,349
That bastard's so heavily leveraged,
it would wipe him out.

341
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,029
Wait a minute.
Am I hearing you right?

342
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,072
Mr "High and Mighty"
is gonna rob his boss?

343
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,071
You hear that,
gila monsters?

344
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,760
Old Nick Beam here
is gonna rob his boss!

345
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,032
I say, do you hear that,
gila monsters?

346
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,948
You know what, Nick? Your wife really
messed your head up bad, man.

347
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,516
You're serious?

348
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,111
- How much he got?
- Only the bulk of his personal assets.

349
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,268
- Six, seven hundred thousand.
- You what?

350
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,437
- Hey, you gonna need some help.
- Oh, no, this has nothing
to do with you.

351
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,439
Hey, I was present at the time
of creative inspiration...

352
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,835
which entitles me
to partial ownership...

353
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,270
in this
criminalistic endeavour.

354
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,518
- Get out.
- Maybe I'll just call Quality
Design Group when we get back.

355
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,913
I want half.

356
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,908
We're gonna bury
this asshole.

357
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,917
Sure, you're right.

358
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,553
If you ever plan

359
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,477
To motor West

360
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,432
Travel my way
Take the highway

361
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,393
That's the best

362
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,273
Come on
Get your kicks

363
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,277
On Route Sixty--

364
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,717
Six

365
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,113
Well, it winds from Chicago

366
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,117
To L.A.

367
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,913
More than 2,000 miles

368
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,395
- Highway shooters?
- One black, one white. You tell me?

369
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,272
You were there,
and they got away?

370
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,279
They were driving
a 1996 Yukon.

371
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,679
- Licence?
- You know, if I had a licence number,
Bart, I wouldn't be standing here...

372
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,234
- eating large quantities
of shit, now, would l?
- No, sir.

373
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,751
Monitor calls on both sides
of the border. Fax that photo
to every precinct on the planet.

374
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,112
There's so much as a sneeze
out there I wanna feel the mist.

375
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,751
I hear a voice

376
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,155
- Give me all your money and a Yoo Hoo.
- The money's all locked up.

377
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,315
That'll be 79 cents, please.

378
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,917
I said
Come on, little prisoner

379
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,634
I got something to say

380
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,952
Something stinks, man.

381
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,548
You sure you ain't got
a gas leak?

382
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,116
- It's my shoes.
- Your shoes?

383
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,796
You ever heard of Dr Scholl's?

384
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,117
I spilled some gas on my shoes
at the gas station.

385
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,800
You know,
the one you robbed.

386
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,352
- Oh, so you got a camcorder up in here.
- What are you doing?

387
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,913
I'm just
checkin' it out, man.

388
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,679
- Pu-- Pu-- Put it down.
- I ain't gonna break it, man.

389
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,190
Just let me check it out.
Just let me see.

390
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,637
Y o, this is your wife?

391
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:29,038
Man, I see why
you were upset.

392
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,755
Not bad, Nick.
Not bad, Nick.

393
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,871
I mean, you know,
for a cheatin' bitch.

394
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,309
Look, don't you call her that.

395
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,590
You-- You don't know her.
Don't call her that.

396
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,518
Okay. No disrespect. Okay?

397
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,831
What should I call her?

398
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,350
Monogamously challenged?

399
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,350
- God.
- I was just fuckin' with you, man.

400
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,436
You know, this is an all right camera
for a regular eight.

401
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,189
- It's the best on the market.
- Let me explain something to you, Nick.

402
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,756
If you ain't got digital,
you ain't got shit.

403
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,155
This has only got
one C.C.D. chip.

404
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,033
Broadcast has three, Nick.

405
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,550
Don't look at me like that.
What, are you surprised I know shit?

406
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,956
The guy that sold me that camera
just set up our computer network.

407
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,789
- Windows NT?
- No. Just Windows.

408
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,878
- Man, get out of here with that shit.
- Look, here's a nutty idea.

409
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,834
If you actually know something about
this stuff, why not use that knowledge
and get a job?

410
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,837
Take a good look at me.

411
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,713
- I'm not exactly the corporate colour.
- That's ridiculous.

412
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,469
- If you wanted a job,
you could have one.
- There's a spider on your head.

413
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,478
- What?
- There's a spider on your head.

414
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,989
Look, I am sorry.
I am not up on all this...

415
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,917
jive-talkin', homeboy lingo.

416
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,032
What's that supposed to mean,
there's a spider on your head?

417
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,153
It means: There's a spider on
your motherfuckin' head, man.

418
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,874
Well, get it off!
Get it off, get it off!

419
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,468
- I ain't touchin' that shit.
- Get it off!

420
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,397
Get it off, get it off,
get if off, get if off!

421
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,832
- Get it off!
- Yo, that's a big fuckin' spider, man.

422
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,632
Oh, shit!

423
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,709
Nick, it's just a spider.

424
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,434
I'm a scat man

425
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:17,030
No, no.
Now don't go crazy.

426
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,197
- Yeah, you go, boy.
- I'm a scat man

427
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,797
Hold on, let me focus.
Let me focus on this shit.

428
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,310
I'm a scat man

429
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,512
Oh, shit.

430
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,629
You got the hot foot!
Yo, Nick!

431
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,957
Get on the good foot.
Get on the good--

432
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,834
Aw, got it!

433
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,717
I'm a scat man

434
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,316
I'm a scat man

435
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,037
I gotta make a call.
You pump.

436
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,674
- Give me the gun.
- What?

437
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,791
Give me the gun.

438
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,314
Man, I wasn't gonna
rob the place, man.

439
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,317
Then you won't need this.

440
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,237
Then you won't need this.

441
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,277
You must be really fast.

442
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,873
Twenty dollars on pump number 15
and a sour fruity twist.

443
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,271
- You a cop?
- No.

444
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,039
You bastards have tried this
too many times!

445
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,957
- Oh, listen--
- Shut up!

446
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,594
- I wasn't gonna--
- Shut up.

447
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,396
Emmitt County Sheriff's Station.
Hello. Hello.

448
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,080
- Uh--
- Y es, may I help you?

449
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,476
That show, Cops...

450
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,795
I love it.

451
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,309
Have you ever had
a really bad day?

452
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,077
I'm havin' one right now.

453
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,839
Now, look, baby,
I told you I'd be home later.

454
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,839
Now, this guy say he got a job
for me, okay, payin' big money.

455
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,952
Okay, now, please, don't argue with me.
Not-Not now. All right?

456
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,355
I'll see you later. Okay.

457
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,157
Oh, oh. Oh.

458
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,478
Now all I want's $20 on pump number 15
and a sour fruity twist.

459
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,195
- Is that too much to ask?
- No, sir.

460
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,959
- Do you mind if I take your gun?
- No, sir.

461
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,390
Would you please rip the phone cord
out of the wall?

462
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,559
- What?
- Would you rip the phone cord
out of the wall, please?

463
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:37,515
Thank you. This is for the phone and for
the gun and for the sour fruity twist.

464
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:43,272
And $20 on pump number 15. Go on.

465
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,356
- Thank you for your patience.
- Yes, sir.

466
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,110
Le-- Let me get this straight.

467
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,993
It's all right for you to rob a place,
but it ain't all right for me?

468
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,917
I didn't rob him.

469
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,998
Well, you got a funny way
of not robbin' a motherfucker.

470
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,509
Nick, let's get out of here,
man, before he calls the cops.

471
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,437
- He's not gonna call the cops.
- How do you know?

472
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,358
I had him rip the phone cord
out of the wall.

473
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,438
Oh, shoot.
That's pretty good.

474
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,790
And you got his gun?

475
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,276
Not bad, Nicholas.
Not bad.

476
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,356
Charlie, this shit's depressing the shit
out of me. It's makin' me sad.

477
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,392
What? Oh, come on, man.
This shit is the shit.

478
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,590
- This is the shit.
It's supposed to make you sad.
- It's grim.

479
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,551
Oh, man, come on.
This is the shit.

480
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,549
This shit is the shit.
This is the hellified love music.

481
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,989
- I'm in bad shape over here.
- Ah, man, you know, maybe I can...

482
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,796
tune you in to a nice A.M. station
and get you some Donny Osmond.

483
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,234
- Charlie, what's this? Slow down.
- Get the fuck out of here.

484
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,794
Pull over and
turn the headlights off.

485
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,712
Y o, man, you could've
gotten me a piece of licorice.

486
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,115
- It's sour.
- So.

487
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,356
Still could've gotten me a piece.

488
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,040
- I didn't think of it.
- Oh, you didn't think of it.

489
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,628
Just selfish, man.
Guess that's the world.

490
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,150
- You know? You just-- You just selfish.
- Here.

491
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,077
Damn.

492
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,591
I swear, white people must got
totally different taste buds, man.

493
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,915
That's a very
racist thing to say.

494
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,032
Oh, yeah? Good.

495
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,720
What the f--

496
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,912
- Oh, shit!
- Whoa, they're rammin' us.

497
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:34,158
Thanks for the late-breakin' news.
Step on the gas, Nick!

498
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,555
I hate new cars.

499
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,671
Whoa!

500
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,432
Look at his face, man.

501
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,632
Look, man!

502
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,393
Our turf, baby.

503
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,793
They don't look like cops.

504
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,797
Definitely not cops.

505
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,514
Get out of the car.

506
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,119
- There you go.
- All right, motherfuckers,
back the fuck off!

507
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,072
Oh, shit. It's cool.

508
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,515
Oh, yeah, I'm cool.
We cool.

509
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,437
I was just fuckin'
with y'all, man.

510
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,357
Hey, what's up?
Y'all-Y'all live around here?

511
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,314
Bring your ass
around the front of the car.

512
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,672
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.
There you go. There you go.

513
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,509
- All right. Okay. Oh, shit.
- Uh-huh. Watch your feet.
- Uh-huh.

514
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,473
Come on, rubber legs. Let's go.
Watch where you're walkin'.

515
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,194
Watch-- Watch your feet.
There you go, baby.

516
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,709
Perhaps you two haven't heard
that my partner and I here...

517
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,116
own the rights to all violent crime
on this particular stretch of highway.

518
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,233
And we don't take kindly to any
unauthorized criminal activities.

519
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,920
You don't understand.
We were--

520
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,793
- Oh, shit.
- That's my car.

521
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,388
- Can I have your attention, please?
- Y eah.

522
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,433
I bet you used to sell more
Girl Scout cookies than any other member
of the whole troop, didn't ya?

523
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,155
What were you calling yourself back
then? Y olanda, you little bitch?

524
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,350
Cynthia? Susan? What was it?
I can't remember.

525
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,914
- Hey, guys, I will be gentle.
Don't even worry about it.
- Huh?

526
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,952
Now-- Now, don't even worry.

527
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,435
Uh-huh.

528
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,197
I have these.

529
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,436
Oh, now that's not
gonna be enough.

530
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,472
Where'd you put your booty?

531
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,639
Now I've done it. I finally found
someone I like less than you.

532
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,150
Shit. That's
a fancy case, friend.

533
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,874
You know, when a sweet-mouthed girl
like you has a fancy case like this...

534
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,549
a man gets to thinkin'
where's the wallet?

535
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,752
That's it.
We're dead, man.

536
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,598
I'm gonna need
that wallet, Alice.

537
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,679
Where's that big, fat wallet?
Give it to me.

538
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,360
Give me your fuckin' wallet,
you little bitch.

539
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,030
- You know what?
- Nick, Nick, what you doin'?

540
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,276
I'm sure you're
a really scary guy.

541
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,188
I'm sure that, normally, people just
quiver at the very sound of your voice.

542
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,835
But, you see, l, I can't
see that right now.

543
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,078
I-l-I just see a weak,
desperate little man...

544
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,953
that probably grew up
torturing little animals.

545
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,911
Some puny, little uncoordinated...

546
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:56,352
can't-make-the-football-team-
so-I'll-pick-on-third-graders-
and-steal-their-lunch-money...

547
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,948
punk, jerk-off bully...

548
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,275
that one day wakes up
and realizes he's nothing.

549
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,393
Just a sad, pathetic, useless,
illiterate piece of inbred shit.

550
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,790
I just want you to know,
I totally disagree.

551
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,430
- Time to die.
- That just makes you my best friend.

552
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,159
All right,
drop the fuckin' gun.

553
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,158
Drop the fuckin' gun!

554
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,077
Give me this, motherfucker.

555
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,953
Now back the fuck up before
I kick you in your bitch-ass chin.

556
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,277
Back the fuck up!
I said, back the fuck up!

557
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,233
Didn't I say, back the fuck up?
Everybody, back the fuck up.

558
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,113
Oh!

559
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:49,076
Shit.

560
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,952
- You shot me.
- I'm sorry, Nick.

561
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,197
- Put down the gun.
- Shut up.

562
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,835
- You shot me.
- I said, I'm sorry, man.
I-l-I didn't mean it.

563
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,837
The gun just went off.

564
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,235
You know, I have that
same trouble in bed.

565
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,432
Well, rarely. Every once
in a great while.

566
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,870
- Put down that gun, you idiot.
- Would you shut up? I'm shot here.

567
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,514
You shut the fuck up.
Who the hell do you think you are?

568
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,995
- You shut the fuck up!
You shut the fuck up!
- Huh? Look at yourself, you candy-ass--

569
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,156
- Man, you shut the fuck up.
- You shut the fuck up.
- Shut up!

570
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,590
- Put down the gun!
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Put that fucking gun down
before you take a fucking toe hit.

571
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,030
- You shut the fuck up!
- I don't give a shit!
- Shut the fuck up!
- Candy-ass motherfucker!

572
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,993
- Shut the fuck up, man!
- Shut the fuck up!
- Hey, hey, hey!

573
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,112
Hey! Everybody,
shut the fuck up!

574
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,515
Now, everybody,
shut the fuck up!

575
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,358
Especially you.
Shut the fuck up.

576
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,755
You like Girl Scout cookies?
Come here. Come here.

577
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,836
You want cookie?
Here's a cookie.

578
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,270
Now back the fuck up like I done
told you two dumb-ass mother--

579
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,595
Back up, back up.

580
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,509
Get in the car, Nick!
Look at you now.

581
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,437
That's good.

582
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,835
Bye, cowboys!

583
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,997
Nick, why the hell you start up
with that guy, man?

584
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,510
- You shot me.
- I'm sorry.

585
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,838
- You shot me.
- I'm sorry.

586
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,111
You don't say you're sorry
when you shoot someone.

587
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,515
You say you're sorry when
you step on someone's toe...

588
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,870
or you accidentally
break their glasses...

589
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,036
or you, you fart
while they're eating.

590
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,720
You-- You don't say you're sorry
when you shoot someone!

591
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,229
Shit.

592
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,796
Oh, my God. It's going numb.
It's going numb. It's going numb.

593
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,639
What?

594
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,069
Shit.

595
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,315
Oh, my God!

596
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,079
Nick, that's the most
hideous thing I ever seen.

597
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,237
Hey, yo, man, you know,
maybe if you wrap your arm in ice...

598
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,920
they can reattach it.

599
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,754
That's funny, man.

600
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,475
- That's a baby gash.
- Shut up.

601
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,070
- But it's a baby gash.
- It could've been a lot worse.
It could've been a lot worse!

602
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,998
- It could've been,
but it wasn't. I'm gonna--
- What are you thinking, shooting?

603
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,917
Look, just calm down,
all right?

604
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,510
You're gonna upset your wound.

605
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,677
Y eah. Do you folks
want a lift somewhere?

606
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,518
- Where you from?
- London.

607
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,392
- Me too!
- Really?

608
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,033
- Yeah!
- That's terrific.

609
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:59,790
Hop in me car. Let's go then.
Come on. Jump in. Let's go.

610
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,549
- Oh, this is great.
- Hey, would you scoot over a smidgen?

611
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,395
Sorry about that.
Cheers, mate.

612
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,237
- Nick Beam.
- Where we headed?

613
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,396
L.A.

614
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,112
City of Angels.

615
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,679
So where you plan
on stayin' tonight?

616
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,712
- I'll just sleep in the car.
- Y eah, right.

617
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,593
You can stay at my place,
brother.

618
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,280
Thanks.
Well, just for the night.

619
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,550
What? Did you think
I was asking you to move in?

620
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,194
- No, I was just sayin'--
- Please, Mr Beam.

621
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,995
- Stay with me forever.
- Just shut up.

622
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,317
- Mr Beam.
- Shut up.

623
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,034
- Mr Beam, Mr Beam, Mr Beam.
- You know how to shut up?

624
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,957
- Mr Beam.
- Is it in your vocabulary?

625
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,310
- Stay with me forever, Mr Beam.
- Is it possible? Do you ever shut up?

626
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,079
Will you stay with me
forever, Mr Beam?

627
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,192
Look here.
When you meet my wife...

628
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,470
she don't know nothin'
about my sideline gig.

629
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,910
- You mean she doesn't know
you're a thief?
- Hey, I'm not a thief, okay?

630
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,510
I just dabble
in future used goods.

631
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:41,349
- Well, what does she think
you do all day?
- Look for work, man.

632
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:48,158
Maybe if you did look for work,
you wouldn't have to steal.

633
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,475
Don't judge me.

634
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,157
You stepped on my shoe.

635
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,555
See, I don't usually
get in this late.

636
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:07,829
Baby, am I glad
to see you.

637
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,555
No, no, no. No, talk to me.
Explain this to me now.

638
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,877
I got mugged.

639
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,514
- Okay, I didn't get mugged.
- I got--

640
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:22,236
- I got mugged. He got beat up.
- Thank--

641
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,749
Remember how I was tellin' you
I had a job interview?

642
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,677
Baby, that's him.
He right there.

643
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,190
That's the player
right there.

644
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:35,189
My name's Nick. Nick Beam.
Nice to meet you.

645
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,118
When are you gonna stop
gettin' into trouble, Terrance?

646
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,878
- Terrance?
- "T."

647
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,629
Okay? My friends call me "T."
You can kiss my ass. Boo!

648
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,955
- Okay, Terrance.
- Oh, Mama.

649
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,675
Please go on
back to bed, Mama.

650
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,553
What kind of man stays out
till 2:30 in the morning...

651
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,477
then comes back lookin'
like a bruised turd?

652
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,114
- Mama, I ain't--
- Don't you talk back.

653
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,550
Don't talk back
to your mother.

654
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,910
W-- What-- What'd I do?

655
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,871
You got that slap
'cause you with him.

656
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,675
- And I know you're part of
whatever badness he's into.
- Mama, enough.

657
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,268
You got some explainin'
to do in the morning, Mr Gentleman.

658
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,233
Now you think on that.

659
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,435
Why do you keep on
smackin' me, Mama?

660
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,675
Okay.

661
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:32,318
- Shh.
- No, go ahead. Go ahead.

662
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,953
- Okay.
- Oh.

663
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,316
Okay, now you come here.
Come here.

664
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,000
Mama didn't have to
smack me three times.

665
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,949
- We gotta move out of here.
- I know.

666
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:54,029
- I know.
- I heard gunshots.

667
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,835
Hey, there, boy. Hey, what
you doing up this late, pal?

668
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,633
Huh? What's up?
What are you doing up this late?

669
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,877
Oh, honey, we woke you.

670
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,468
Now look, don't worry.
Give Daddy a kiss. Come on.

671
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:10,195
Don't worry. I ain't gonna let nothin'
happen to y'all. You know that, right?

672
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:15,269
- What happened to your face?
- No, I'm cool, little man.

673
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,277
Hey, you do your homework?

674
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,038
- Yes, sir.
- I said, did you do your homework?

675
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,037
- Hmm? Hmm?
- Y-- Yes, sir.

676
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:25,597
- What about you, little miss?
Did you do all your homework?
- I don't have any homework.

677
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:29,633
You don't have no homework? All right,
time to go back to bed. Let's go.

678
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,311
Hut-two-three-four
Make a right at the right door

679
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,877
Make your choice 'cause you got
to grow up to be successful

680
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,356
- I hope this isn't
an inconvenience for you.
- Not at all.

681
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,632
You seem like a nice man. Terrance
can use a few of those in his life.

682
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,035
- Good night.
- Good night.

683
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,037
Thanks.

684
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,637
Hey.

685
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,391
You know, I never noticed before,
but you got really nice eyes.

686
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,636
- Shut up!
- But you do.

687
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,151
Let's get this over with.
I can't believe it. I'm committing
armed robbery for two flashlights.

688
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,238
Hey, don't worry about it.
Let's go.

689
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,636
Freeze, motherfucker!

690
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,753
You move your ass so much
as an inch, I'll blow it off!

691
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,395
- You hear me, motherfucker?
- Hey.
- You hear me? What?

692
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:40,071
- Why you acting so mean?
- Hey, look, man. Now ain't
the fuckin' time, all right?

693
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,112
- You say scary shit, it scares 'em.
- Yeah, but you have a gun.

694
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,152
Plus, what you're doing
is a stereotypical robber thing.

695
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:51,229
I mean, it's a lot scarier
if someone with a gun is calm
and cool and collected, man.

696
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,432
- That's bullshit, man. Don't--
- Here.

697
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:58,473
Excuse me, sir. Come here.

698
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:02,639
Come here. Come here.

699
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,395
Now, look, Henry...

700
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,353
we're gonna take
some things outta here...

701
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,517
and you're just gonna
stand there.

702
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,713
- You got a problem with that?
- No.

703
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,877
Good.

704
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:30,997
Now, honestly, which one
did you think was scarier?

705
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,912
- Honestly?
- Mm-hmm.

706
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,430
He was scarier.

707
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:43,678
Really? You didn't find
what he did contrived?

708
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:48,157
- No. It was scary.
- Well, what part?

709
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:52,398
Well, the, uh, "Freeze, motherfucker"
part was scary.

710
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:56,149
And then he led me to believe
that if I moved my ass...

711
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,794
it, it might be blown off.

712
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:06,108
- You were scary too.
- Oh, come on. You're just saying that.
You don't have to lie.

713
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,038
No, I'm not. I thought
you were very scary.

714
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,957
- Really?
- Yeah.

715
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:14,470
- Well, thank you, Henry.
- Yo, check it out.

716
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,034
They're flashlights
with A.M./F.M. radio on it.

717
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:21,517
They all that. You can listen to
your music while the light's on, boy.

718
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,551
All right, all right!

719
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,797
Come on. Come on.

720
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,516
Freeze, sucker-bitch!

721
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,317
That was much better.

722
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,955
Thank you, Henry.
See ya later now.

723
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,913
What the hell is
"sucker-bitch"?

724
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:04,674
I wanna live in the jungle

725
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,951
Where you don't got
to wear no clothes

726
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,833
And they got no boutiques

727
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,996
Nothin' chic

728
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,032
In the jungle
they don't have no disco

729
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,390
Y o, yo, Rig!

730
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,636
Hey, yo, Rig!

731
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,832
Y eah, come on over here
and meet Ginger and Mary Ann.

732
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,631
Ow! God!

733
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,069
Charlie, we gotta go!

734
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,952
Go, go, go, go, go, go

735
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,799
Go, go, go, go, go, go

736
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:34,310
- Break, break
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

737
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,317
- Hey, Nick, what floor is it on?
- Fifteenth.

738
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,795
- What-- What-- What fifteenth?
- Come on.

739
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,797
Why can't we just
use the elevator?

740
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,037
- 'Cause there's a guard
that patrols the building.
- This is bullshit!

741
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,276
Come on, man. It's Saturday night.
They're not gonna be there anyway.

742
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,311
Look, I know we're gonna go
back Monday and we're gonna get him.

743
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,000
I just wanna check it out.
Take a left here, will you?

744
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,590
You seriously busted up my party.
You know that.

745
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:58,234
Those girls were attracted
to you. I mean, Christ's sake,
they're only human.

746
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,874
-You're a handsome man. We will go back.
-I'll hold you to that.

747
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,673
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm. What's the matter with you?

748
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,359
- You sharp.
- Okay.
- Yeah.

749
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,552
Beat you.

750
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,319
- I carried the damn bag.
- I still beat you.

751
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,079
Beat me at what?
Climbing steps?

752
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,079
Guess we'll call you
the "Step King."

753
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,476
Oh, shit.

754
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,510
No problem.
I know the code.

755
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,798
- What?
- Come on. Come on.

756
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,798
Shit! That asshole
must've changed the code.

757
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,480
Step aside. Let me take a look.
Let me take a look.

758
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,591
Okay, let me look.
Mm-hmm.

759
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:05,757
- What are you gonna do?
- You got 12 possible stations here.
You're only using seven.

760
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,668
I'm gonna make the other five stations
active, run a test mode...

761
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,075
and force the system
into rotation.

762
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,191
What does that mean?

763
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,390
We got five minutes.

764
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,633
Here. Put on your mask.

765
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,275
Is that mask sweaty? I think
that's the one I hid behind my balls.

766
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,799
All right.

767
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,878
- Y eah, all right.
- All right, all right.

768
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,151
Ooh, yeah. Let's go.
We got three minutes. Let's go.

769
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,635
- Lookin' good.
- Y eah.

770
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:12,639
Put the money in there.
Let's go. All right. Let's go.

771
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:18,558
Here we go. Money. Money.

772
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,955
Let's go. Mask, mask.

773
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:27,430
Let's go, baby.
Let's go, baby. Let's go!

774
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,714
What the hell are you doin'?
Nick?

775
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,196
Okay, that's real clever, Nick.
Let's go.

776
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:58,076
Come on, man.

777
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:09,270
This is very nice.
It's very nice. It's very nice.

778
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,517
Oh. I don't think I've ever seen
a more beautiful piece of shit.

779
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,517
Nick. Nick!

780
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,200
Very nice. Very nice.
Very nice.

781
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,230
Yeah!

782
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,875
That's great. That's great.
You done cut the dick off a statue.

783
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,597
How's it feel, Phillip?

784
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:38,157
You had it all, but it wasn't enough
for you. You had to mess with me.

785
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,512
Nobody messes with Nick Beam.

786
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,435
I feel lucky

787
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,199
I just feel that way

788
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:23,393
I'm on a bus to Atlantic City

789
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,990
Later on today

790
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,391
- Your face, man. You showed your face.
- It doesn't matter.

791
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:37,877
It does matter. They catch you,
they catch me. It damn well matters!

792
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,999
- I'm a winner
- Hey, man, look at me.

793
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,793
Look at me, man.
I'm not goin' down for this shit.

794
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:53,078
And now I know

795
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,156
Why I've been sent

796
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,829
Little rump shaker
She can really shake and bake

797
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,030
She's got skills

798
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,480
- Watch her slippin' and a slidin'
- Here, man!

799
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,955
- Makin' booty left to right
- Here!

800
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,469
She's got skills

801
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:01,989
Hmm. The alarm
must've been set.

802
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:19,669
Addressing the groove
I see you're drinkin' again

803
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:23,759
You're smokin' smack inside your
cigarettes and lookin' pale and thin

804
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,916
It's a shame

805
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:28,952
It's a pity in New York City

806
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:32,436
Well

807
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,477
Well, well, well
well, well

808
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,353
Something has changed

809
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,596
The way these people think

810
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:09,479
Hey there, lonely girl

811
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,717
Lonely girl

812
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:17,789
Let me make your
broken heart like new

813
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,191
- Oh, shit.
- Hey there, lonely--

814
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,917
White people.

815
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,875
Our dates.

816
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,990
Ohh, shit.

817
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,315
Oh-ho-ho.
Look at this, man!

818
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,752
Mama-say, mama-sa, makusa!
Oh, smack me two times!

819
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,711
Calm down.

820
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:16,308
My son is going
to the best schools.

821
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,193
My daughter, she ain't even
gonna know what a food stamp is.

822
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:23,279
My wife,
we goin' out all the time.

823
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,231
All the time!

824
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:32,276
- What's wrong with you, man?
- Nothing.

825
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,960
You sweatin' that bullshit, ain't you?
You sweatin' that bullshit.

826
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,640
You did what you had to do
to that guy, man. Don't worry about it.

827
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,479
All right? Put that shit
behind you, man. Where you goin'?

828
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:44,434
Where you goin'?
Where you goin'?

829
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,755
I'm just gonna--
I'm just gonna take a walk.

830
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,677
All right.
Well, hurry back.

831
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,598
I got willpower,
but I don't know how much.

832
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:55,110
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah.

833
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,396
There is somethin'

834
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:01,149
On your mind

835
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:09,471
By the way
you look at me

836
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,030
There is somethin'

837
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:20,233
On your mind, honey

838
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:26,951
Did you ever do somethin' that you
thought would make you feel great?

839
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,150
In a weird way,
you almost feel worse.

840
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,999
Revenge, huh?
Some things hurt no matter what.

841
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:34,156
That must be a fact
of life.

842
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:37,750
- And what you're thinkin'
- Hi!

843
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,633
Hi! Nick.

844
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:43,877
I can't believe it.
What are you doin' here?

845
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,072
- Danielle.
- Oops.

846
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,589
I don't know
what I'm doin' here.

847
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:52,473
- What are you doin' here?
- Well, Sheila, my best friend--

848
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:56,275
Well, she used to be my best friend.
I guess, technically,
Marcy would be my best friend.

849
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,073
I mean, they both think they're my
best friend, which is okay by me.

850
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:02,351
But once I did have this nightmare
where Sheila and Marcy are sitting...

851
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:05,278
right next to each other, and this
Eskimo guy comes over and says, "Pick."

852
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:09,632
I thought I was gonna die. I mean,
an Eskimo guy. What is that all about?

853
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:12,035
Anyway, Sheila, she's visiting
and she's staying here.

854
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,355
And so I thought I'd take her
to a party and show her a good time.

855
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:18,792
And she meets this guy and goes home
with him instead. And, oh, well.

856
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,673
You really look good.

857
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,591
You look--
You look good too.

858
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:27,917
- Thank you.
- Do you want a drink?

859
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,508
Uh-huh. Y eah. Sure.

860
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:36,159
You know, I'm such a klutz. I spilled
beer all over my dress earlier.

861
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:40,910
And, well, I think it's stained.
Did it stain, Nick?

862
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,348
I have Sheila's room key.
You wanna come up?

863
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,948
- Let's get hot
- Oh, yes, it's ladies' night

864
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:59,275
And the vibes is right

865
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,675
Oh, yes, it's ladies' night
Oh, what a night

866
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,791
Oh, what a night

867
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,913
It's ladies' night
and the feeling's right

868
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,793
Oh, yes, it's ladies' night
Oh, what a night

869
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,876
Oh, what a night

870
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,755
Nick, Nick,
use your key, man.

871
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,077
All right.
All right, Nick. Damn!

872
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,839
- Hey, Nick, why couldn't
you just use your key?
- Turn your bed down?

873
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,469
Stay.

874
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:12,190
The lady is lookin' good

875
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:16,233
- Just like the lady should
- Just like the lady should

876
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:20,148
I've been thinking about this
for so long. I want you so bad.

877
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,271
I just wanted to
make her happy.

878
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,039
This is gonna be a night
that you won't forget.

879
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:26,991
I try to forget,
but I can't.

880
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:31,318
- Give it to me, Nick.
- Give. That's all I did was give.

881
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:44,633
Nick? Nick, you're really putting
a damper on the mood here.

882
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,796
I'm sorry.
I don't know.

883
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,992
Danielle, I can't.
I just can't.

884
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,637
I just wanna make you mine

885
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:57,752
We'll be together
till the end of time

886
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:01,031
Hey, Kareem. Are you aware
that Charlie and l...

887
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:04,436
had intended to come up here
and cap your punk ass?

888
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,437
And your girlfriend Nick.

889
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,836
But, shit, you two muffins did such an
outstanding job with this financing...

890
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,077
I mean, who could think about killing
at a time like this?

891
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,590
Thanks. Your approval
means a lot.

892
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:20,793
- Did I tell you to speak?
Did I tell you to speak?
- Charlie, no.

893
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:24,151
That's gonna be too loud.

894
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:26,396
Too loud.

895
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:59,279
- Hello? Hello?
- Hi.

896
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,836
Oh, my God!
Nick, is that you? Are you okay?

897
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:07,192
- I'm fine.
- Oh, thank God!

898
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,356
I didn't know if, if you--

899
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:13,189
I thought that--
You're not hurt?

900
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:17,950
- No.
- Oh, thank God! Where are you?

901
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:23,359
Look, Ann, let's not make this harder
than it has to be. I saw you.

902
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:27,632
- What?
- I saw you. I know.

903
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,035
Saw me what?
What are you talking about?

904
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:32,879
Come on. Do you have to do this?
You and Phillip.

905
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,389
- What about him?
- You're denying it. She's denying it.

906
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:40,230
I don't believe this.
Friday afternoon. Remember?

907
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:45,070
Well, guess what.
I came home early. I saw you, Ann.

908
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:50,638
- I was there.
- Oh. Oh, no.

909
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,274
Yeah. Oh, no.

910
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,235
Nick, I was still
at work Friday afternoon.

911
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:03,434
At work? Well, then your-your clone
was at home screwing my boss.

912
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:07,269
Nick, it was my sister.
Remember, I told you...

913
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,994
she was coming next Friday
with her fiance?

914
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:13,556
Well, I made a mistake. It was this
Friday. They called from the airport.

915
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,352
I told them about
the key in the planter.

916
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,391
I called you, but you'd
already left the office.

917
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,909
So I left you a message
on the machine at home.

918
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:23,874
What about-- What about the cuff links?
Phillip's cuff links
were on the sink, Ann.

919
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,514
Honey, they've been in the dresser
since the Christmas party.

920
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:30,474
I left them on the counter so you'd
finally remember to bring them to him.

921
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,160
So you're not having
an affair?

922
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:36,955
- No, you dick!
- You still love me?

923
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:39,275
More than anything in the world.

924
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:43,712
You-- You wouldn't believe
what I've been through.

925
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:48,630
You're gonna laugh,
but I actually-- Shit.

926
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:51,593
- What's the matter? What's wrong?
- Shit!

927
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,792
- What's the matter? What?
- Shit!

928
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,797
Shit! Shit!

929
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,911
Shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit...

930
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,395
shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit.

931
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,754
Going down.

932
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,400
- Don't touch it.
- Oh, man.

933
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,397
Oh, man.

934
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:32,110
I think I can open the door
and catch the sheet.

935
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:35,152
- Don't touch the sheet, please. Don't--
- No, no, no.

936
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,158
- No, don't move. Don't move.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
I done moved the hand.

937
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:41,716
I really don't think
you should be moving right now.
I-I think you're moving.

938
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:44,274
- Call the paramedics. Listen to me.
- All right.

939
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,597
Get them here
as fast as you can!

940
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,870
Have them meet me
with a gurney.

941
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,560
- Wait. Let me practise.
- Let you practise?

942
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:56,275
I'm hangin' on
a fuckin' ledge, man.

943
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,119
- I don't wanna die like this, Nick.
- All right.

944
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:01,276
I wasn't tryin'
to stick you up, man!

945
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,516
First, I'm gonna say "one."
Then I'm gonna say "two."
Then I'm gonna say "three."

946
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,029
- And then I'm gonna do it.
- I can't hear you.

947
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:10,233
- I'm gonna start with one
and count to three!
- Okay.

948
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:12,635
Ready?
One.

949
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:14,637
- Right.
- Two.

950
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,035
I can't hear you!
You gotta be louder, Nick!

951
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:20,630
- I said, "two"!
- Are you on "two" already?

952
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:23,149
- I'll start again!
- Start from "one"!

953
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,230
- One..
- Right.
- Two.

954
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:29,272
- I got you.
- Three!

955
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:32,437
- Nick!
- I got it! I got it! Got it!

956
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:39,192
Well, you go, boy!
You my--

957
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:56,475
The elevator!
The money!

958
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,799
Remind me to kick
your ass later.

959
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:18,190
Oh! We're rich, man!

960
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:21,710
- We are in the bigs.
- Charlie. Charlie, smell that.

961
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,637
Oh, yes! You, too,
can be a millionaire!

962
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,398
Hookers!

963
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,954
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,
Charlie, smell this.

964
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,310
More hookers!

965
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:33,159
- Hookers!
- We hit the mother lode, man!

966
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,316
- What the fuck is that?
- What the fuck--

967
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,431
- Okay. What now?
- I don't know.

968
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,471
What do you mean, you don't know?
I thought you said you had a plan.

969
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:43,309
- That was my plan: to ram them.
- Ram them.

970
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,032
Speed up!

971
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:51,069
- Shoot the mother-- Shoot him!
- I got him! I got him!

972
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,111
- Shoot 'em!
- Geez!

973
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,028
You know, I'm tired of this shit.
Let's go!

974
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,792
Charlie!
Look out, Charlie!

975
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:15,115
I'm actually grabbing a gun
and going after bad guys.

976
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:17,674
You the man.

977
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:25,437
All right.

978
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:33,996
- You see 'em?
- No.

979
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:36,588
I'll, uh--
I'll let you know.

980
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:39,757
Please do.
Nick.

981
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:47,196
What?

982
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:53,832
- You checkin' this shit out?
- Hey, Nick.

983
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:55,837
I like you like this.

984
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:58,190
You and your prom date
both having weapons.

985
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:02,029
That way I don't have to kill
an unarmed couple. It's not my style.

986
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,355
Put down the bag.

987
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,071
- Paul Bunyan, come and take the bag.
- Nick, let me--

988
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,430
- You're an idiot! Shut up!
- Shoot this mother--
- No, you're a fuckin' idiot!

989
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:15,997
Who are you? Crime dog now?
Are you aware that there's only
two kind of people on the whole planet?

990
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:18,680
There are killers,
and then there's everybody else.

991
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:23,430
I'm a killer, Nick. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
What are you, Nick?

992
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:30,234
I'm married.

993
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:35,438
Oh, you son of a--
Wait, wait, wait.

994
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:38,154
Oh, shit!

995
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,077
What are you,
fuckin' out of your mind?

996
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,634
- Fuck!
- What, are you crazy?

997
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,469
Huh? Who's in control now?

998
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,875
Hand over the bag...

999
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,993
or else my man Nick Beam here
gonna put one in your ass.

1000
01:19:58,120 --> 01:19:59,951
Ain't that right, Nick?

1001
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:08,516
- I'll roll over.
- Okay, I see it. I see it.

1002
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:11,359
Let me try to get around
and get you.

1003
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,152
No, it's not--

1004
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,793
- No, they're in the alley.
- Charlie, it's the police.
- Oh, yes!

1005
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:22,516
- Thank God you're here.
- Thank God you're here, man.
- Oh, this nightmare's over.

1006
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:24,995
- What the fuck are you doin'?
- Put the gun down!

1007
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,509
Put that gun down,
you stupid pig!

1008
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:30,029
- Wait! Come on!
- Come on, man!

1009
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:36,073
It's them.

1010
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:40,398
Well, some folks in Arizona are
gonna be mighty happy to see you boys.

1011
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,390
Wait, wait, wait! Officer! Officer!
Officer, two other guys--

1012
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:53,036
"I'm married." Ka-blam!
You're too much.

1013
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,957
- Is the money all there?
- Looks like it.

1014
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:59,676
Great. We have just enough time
to get it back.

1015
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,836
Excuse me?

1016
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:05,032
We have to bring the money back.

1017
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,798
No, no.

1018
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:10,117
Maybe you're a little bit confused
about the purpose of a robbery.

1019
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:13,357
Oh, T., I didn't tell you. When we
were at the hotel, I called my wife.

1020
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,755
Everything's all right.
You see, it wasn't her.

1021
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:19,031
She wasn't even there.
Isn't that great?

1022
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:23,354
It was her sister
and her sister's fiance.

1023
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:27,109
I don't give a damn if it was
her Uncle Fester and Gumby.

1024
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,834
You ain't takin'
this money anywhere, man.

1025
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,956
I don't wanna
hear all that.

1026
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,390
- Let go. Let go.
- Gimme the bag. You let go.

1027
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,192
- Let go of the bag. You let--
- It's not your money.

1028
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,719
- It's not your money.
- It's not your money!

1029
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,478
- It's not yours. It's half mine.
- Let go!

1030
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,158
- You let go!
- Let go!
- You let go!

1031
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,157
Let go!

1032
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,070
Get back here!

1033
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,793
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1034
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:23,117
- And you?
- I'll live.

1035
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:28,440
Can't let you take
the money, Nick.

1036
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,279
T., my life is in that bag.

1037
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:36,474
Nick, even if you wanted
to take the money back, you can't.

1038
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:40,479
- Your face is on the video, man.
- They only review the tapes
if something's missing.

1039
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,910
I can go into work early
and bring it back. No one'll know.

1040
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,677
T.

1041
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:55,916
I can get my life back.

1042
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:15,428
You forget one thing, Nick.
I get my life back too.

1043
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,799
Money don't make
my world go 'round

1044
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:55,752
I'm reaching out
for the higher ground

1045
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:01,748
To a warm and peaceful place

1046
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:06,476
I can rest my weary face

1047
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,195
Life's answers we try to find

1048
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,914
Oh, we try to find
Yes, we try to find

1049
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:16,350
Battling inside our minds

1050
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:22,749
Where do I go from here

1051
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:27,237
Will all my friends be there

1052
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:30,272
'Cause we're living
we're living

1053
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,436
In a crazy maze

1054
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,358
And we're fighting
we're fighting

1055
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:36,833
To rise above the haze

1056
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:40,077
Lights at the end
of the tunnel

1057
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,839
Sometimes the journey's long

1058
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,349
There are many theories

1059
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:48,677
Who's right and who's wrong

1060
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:53,835
Pressure's on
I have to choose

1061
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,592
I've got nothing to lose

1062
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:04,194
I close my eyes
I take a chance

1063
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:08,552
I-l, I now dance
a different dance

1064
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,676
What's the key
to a happy life

1065
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,268
Tell me now, now, now

1066
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:18,358
Healthy mind
and lots of spice

1067
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,876
Running barefoot
through the trees

1068
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,151
- Oh, my God!
- That's my idea of free

1069
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,874
Ow. Ouch.

1070
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,560
What happened to you?

1071
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:34,989
It's a long story.

1072
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,395
- I got shot.
- What?

1073
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,114
And l-- I think
I'm wanted in Arizona.

1074
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:44,317
Plus, my shoes
caught on fire.

1075
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:52,117
You told me you were selling me
the top of the line.
The top of the line is digital.

1076
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:54,629
Did you sell me a digital?
No, you did not.

1077
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,637
So, I'm bringing it back,
and I expect a full refund.

1078
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,637
And if you do not give me
a full refund, you will not...

1079
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:00,955
be doing business
with myself or my company.

1080
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:02,911
Thank you.

1081
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,952
- So, did you hear?
- What?

1082
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,514
Some, uh, vandals
broke in over the weekend.

1083
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:15,633
- What?
- Well, nothing was stolen.
They-- They cut the--

1084
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,830
the thingy...

1085
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:21,350
off P B.'s statue.

1086
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:27,470
Um, they're reviewing
the videotape.

1087
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:37,278
- Hi, everybody. How's it going?
- Not now, Nick.

1088
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:42,313
- Did anybody see that game last night?
- Game? What game?

1089
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:45,352
- Oh, that game. Overtime.
- Will you please shut up!

1090
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:52,277
Don't touch it. Don't touch it.
Oh, you pig. Oh, you pig.

1091
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,951
Well, that's it.
What's done is done. Listen.

1092
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,957
I've got this great idea for
the new McGinty Cracker mascot.

1093
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:04,196
- Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!
Thank you.
- This mascot--

1094
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,629
- This--
- Nick! Shut up!

1095
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,674
What's happening?

1096
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:19,956
Well, what is this?
What the hell is this?

1097
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:23,914
- I don't know.
- You goin' crazy as a spider!

1098
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:26,315
Somebody must've recorded
over the tape.

1099
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:30,797
- Who had access?
- Uh, there was an electrician
in here this morning.

1100
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:33,354
What electrician?
I did not order an electrician!

1101
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:37,917
I did. The flickers on the--
Fluorescent lights were flickering.

1102
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:40,395
- I'm really sorry, sir.
- This is terrible, Phil.

1103
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:42,078
- I would really like to be alone now.
- I'll go now.
- You should go.

1104
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,316
- I would be really like to be alone.
- You should go.
- I'll leave now.
- You should go too.

1105
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:47,159
- I would like to be
extremely alone for a minute.
- I'm gonna leave you alone.

1106
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:50,078
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Nick.

1107
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:57,151
All right now. Cut that out.
Y'all wanna eat? You wanna eat?

1108
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,316
- Y eah, we wanna eat.
- I thought you wanna eat.
You wanna eat? All right.

1109
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,635
- Just don't burn the meat.
- I don't never burn the meat.

1110
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,558
- Uh-huh. What happened the last time?
- Hey, Dad don't burn the meat.

1111
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:07,717
- I'm gonna put some more
po-po sauce on it. Y'all like that.
- Joey. Tonya.

1112
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:11,355
- Y eah, that's--
- Go see your mama, boy. You know.

1113
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:14,313
Now this is my very
special mustard.

1114
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,715
- Don't let nobody touch that.
- Okay, Mama.

1115
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:19,434
- All right.
- Yeah.

1116
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:22,074
So, how's the
electrician business?

1117
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:27,837
Hey. Not bad.
The hours are a bitch.

1118
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:30,797
I wanna thank you.

1119
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:35,471
I don't know why-- I just wanna say
I appreciate what you did.

1120
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:40,710
Well, don't mention it. How's that?
How did you know where I was anyway?

1121
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,391
A friend gave me a tip.

1122
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:48,509
A friend, huh?

1123
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:51,438
- You hungry?
- Yes, we would love for you to join us.

1124
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:53,596
Wouldn't we, Mama?

1125
01:28:57,320 --> 01:29:00,039
I talked to my boss today
after things settled down.

1126
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:04,551
Convinced him we need
a new security system. Got any ideas?

1127
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:07,114
Sure. I can help you
pick one out.

1128
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:10,471
You wanna run it?
We need someone trustworthy.

1129
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:13,273
I told him I know
just the guy.

1130
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:15,118
Well, I'm gonna have to
think about this, Nick.

1131
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:19,392
Right now, I'm weighing out
several lucrative offers.
I mean, they rollin' in.

1132
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,829
A lot of people want me
to work for them right now.

1133
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:25,077
Now, that's just
the way I like it.

1134
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:28,317
All I need now is some
of Mama's special mustard.

1135
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:30,271
Stop.

1136
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:39,240
What'd I do?

1137
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:53,554
- Run, run!
- Stay down, Nick. Get on outta here.

1138
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:56,752
I'll beat you into the--

1139
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:01,516
See you when you get there

1140
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:15,590
Now I seen places and faces of things
you ain't never thought about thinkin'

1141
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:18,154
If you ain't peeked then you
must be drinkin' and smokin'

1142
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:21,636
Pretendin' that you're locin'
but you're broken, let me get you open

1143
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:24,513
Now, little Timmy got his diploma
and little Jimmy got life

1144
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:27,313
And Tamica around the corner
just took her first hit off the pipe

1145
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:30,000
The other homey shot the other homey
and ran off with his money

1146
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:32,634
And when the other homeys heard about it
they thought that it was funny

1147
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,115
But who's the dummy 'cause now
you done lost a hustler

1148
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:37,549
A down-ass brother
done replaced by a bustler

1149
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:39,910
And though I got love for ya
I know I can't trust ya

1150
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:42,634
'Cause my crew is rollin' numbers
and your crew is rollin' dusters

1151
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:45,513
And just because of that you act
like you don't like a brother no more

1152
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,790
I guess that's just
the way you go

1153
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:51,549
I ain't tryin' to preach, I believe
I can reach but your mind ain't prepared

1154
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:53,477
I see ya when you get there

1155
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:57,115
I'll see you
when you get there

1156
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:59,913
If you ever get there

1157
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:02,998
See you when you get there

1158
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:07,557
I'll see you
when you get there

1159
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:09,989
If you ever get there

1160
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:13,157
See you when you get there

1161
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,475
More temptation and fate
I guess we livin' for today

1162
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,319
I seen a man get swept off his feet
by a bull with an AK

1163
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:20,715
The situation's so twisted
everybody gettin' lifted

1164
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:23,593
I'm just tryin' to take care
of my kids and handle my business

1165
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:26,075
'Cause it's way too serious
so you gotta pay close attention

1166
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:28,634
So you don't get caught slippin'
when they come to do all the gettin'

1167
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:30,955
Life is a big game so you gotta
play it with the big boys

1168
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:33,514
Some of us gotta run a little faster
'cause we gotta lay the straw

1169
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:36,393
But I'd be a fool to surrender
when I know I can be a contender

1170
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,909
If everybody's ascended
then everybody can be a winner

1171
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:41,190
No matter your rag color
Deep down we all brothers

1172
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:43,834
And we gonna set a time
Somebody up there still love us

1173
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:46,474
I'm gonna scuffle and struggle with ya
I'm breathless and weak

1174
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:49,068
I done strived my whole life
to make it to the mountain peak

1175
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:51,555
Always keep reachin'
Sure to grab onto somethin'

1176
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,558
I'll be there when you get there
waitin' with the sounds bumpin'

1177
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:58,878
I'll see you
when you get there

1178
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,150
If you ever get there

1179
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:04,397
See you when you get there

1180
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:08,991
I'll see you
when you get there

1181
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:11,509
If you ever get there

1182
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:14,712
See you when
you get there

1183
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:17,798
As we walk down the road
of our destiny

1184
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:20,480
And the time comes to choose
which shall it be

1185
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,511
The wide and crooked
or the straight and narrow

1186
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:25,473
We got one voice to give
and one life to live

1187
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,273
Stand up for somethin'
or lay down in the game

1188
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,709
Listen to the song
that we sing

1189
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:32,717
It's up to you
to make your beef

1190
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:35,434
I guess I'll see you
when you see me

1191
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:39,439
I'll see you

1192
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:42,358
When you get there

1193
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:45,313
If you wanna get there

1194
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:49,752
- I'll see you
- I'll see you

1195
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:52,952
- When you get there
- When you get there

1196
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:55,753
- If you wanna get there
- If you really

1197
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:59,998
- I'll see you
- I'll see you

1198
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:03,430
- When you get there
- When you get there

1199
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:05,994
- If you wanna get there
- If you really

1200
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:10,113
I'll see you

1201
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:12,151
When you get there
