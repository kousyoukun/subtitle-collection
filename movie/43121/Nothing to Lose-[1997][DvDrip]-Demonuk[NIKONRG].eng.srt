1
00:00:15,987 --> 00:00:17,826
Where do I start?

2
00:00:23,707 --> 00:00:25,466
Its not you.

3
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:29,265
Well, actually, it is you.

4
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:34,235
Look, I��m just not-

5
00:00:34,386 --> 00:00:37,115
I��m not attracted
to you any more.

6
00:00:39,115 --> 00:00:40,954
I need space.

7
00:00:43,115 --> 00:00:44,954
You kinda-

8
00:00:46,554 --> 00:00:49,673
You kinda gross me out.

9
00:00:52,314 --> 00:00:56,873
In the beginning, it was different.
In the beginning, you were better.

10
00:00:57,033 --> 00:01:01,312
But then I got to know you
real well, and...

11
00:01:01,473 --> 00:01:04,192
I- I came to realize...

12
00:01:07,472 --> 00:01:09,391
that you��re a fat idiot.

13
00:01:12,312 --> 00:01:15,471
- I got ya. I got ya. I got ya. I got ya.
- Okay. Okay.

14
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:18,430
- Okay, okay, okay. Let me try it.
- You gotta be straight.

15
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:21,790
- Okay. - Straight face.
- Okay, okay. - All right.

16
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,189
- I want a divorce.
- Why?

17
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,069
Its a physical thing.

18
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,549
- Physical?
- I��ve been experimenting with other men lately.

19
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:39,228
A lot of other men
and women.

20
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:45,628
I don��t know. I mean, Antonio can do
this thing with his tongue...

21
00:01:46,628 --> 00:01:49,227
and Williams stamina
is amazing.

22
00:01:49,388 --> 00:01:54,107
And as far as hands go,
well, your fathers hands are-

23
00:01:56,667 --> 00:02:00,306
You are no match.
I have no equal.

24
00:02:00,477 --> 00:02:03,516
Get down here.

25
00:02:03,676 --> 00:02:05,635
If the shoe fits

26
00:02:05,796 --> 00:02:08,635
I want you to wear it
and wear it good

27
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:15,074
Sulkin about them times
when I was by myself

28
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:19,234
I was always lookin
for somebody else

29
00:02:19,395 --> 00:02:23,634
But as time went on
I had a talk with my mind

30
00:02:23,794 --> 00:02:27,553
Friends like you and you
I gotta leave behind

31
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:31,793
And I��m sayin�� call me a fool
��CCause you only rub it in

32
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:36,992
- And Ill never see you if I had known
- I��ll never see them again

33
00:02:37,153 --> 00:02:40,592
Cause, well I know the difference
Just stay in my own business

34
00:02:40,752 --> 00:02:43,711
And Ill never, ever
depend on you

35
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:49,671
Friends and enemies
around me every day

36
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:53,950
I cant believe
the things they say

37
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:58,190
Takin me for granted
Give me no credit at all

38
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,949
Ill just keep bouncin��
like a bouncin�� ball

39
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:11,868
I don��t wanna step
on nobody��s foot but

40
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:23,547
You call me a fool
but you only rub it in

41
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,467
And Ill never see you
if I had known

42
00:03:26,627 --> 00:03:28,506
Ill never see that again

43
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:32,476
Cause, well I know the difference
Just stay in my own business

44
00:03:32,637 --> 00:03:36,116
And Ill never, ever
depend on you

45
00:03:54,874 --> 00:03:59,153
B- B-B-Brickmans!
B- B-Brickman��s Powerboats!

46
00:03:59,314 --> 00:04:01,913
Get it?
Brickmans sells powerboats.

47
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:06,513
We make the company mascot
a powerboat. What do you think?

48
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,192
- I like it. Good work, Alan.
- Yes!

49
00:04:10,353 --> 00:04:12,912
- Zachary, you��re up.
- All right. I just wanna show you-

50
00:04:13,073 --> 00:04:15,712
- Ladies and gentlemen, Zachary!
- Yes, sir. No-

51
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:18,271
I haven��t taken these to the focus group
yet. I��m still working on that part.

52
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:20,911
But I just wanted to let you know
these are just preliminary sketches.

53
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:23,071
Zach.

54
00:04:23,232 --> 00:04:27,271
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing
the new mascot for Hidy Ho Cookies-

55
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:31,110
Zippy!

56
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,429
What- What is it?

57
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,549
- Zippy.
- What is Zippy?

58
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:44,948
- He��s a cookie man.
- He��s a cookie man?

59
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:47,028
What is that, uh,
on the ground behind him?

60
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:49,468
Oh, that��s a trail of chocolate chips.
See, wherever Zippy goes...

61
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:51,908
he leaves this magical trail of
chocolate for all the boys and girls-

62
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:56,067
Magical? This- This looks like poop.
It looks like piles of poop.

63
00:04:56,228 --> 00:05:00,067
- It looks like Zippy's walking around, ju-
just crapping all over the place. - Stop.

64
00:05:00,228 --> 00:05:01,797
- It looks like-
- No, no. Those are chocolate chips.

65
00:05:01,957 --> 00:05:04,236
- Emma, what do you think it looks like?
- Excrement.

66
00:05:04,397 --> 00:05:08,476
Zach, lets just say you��re about to take
a big bite of a juicy chocolate chip cookie?

67
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:11,796
What��s the last image you want
floating through your head?

68
00:05:11,956 --> 00:05:13,995
- Excrement?
- Excrement. Right.

69
00:05:14,156 --> 00:05:17,235
Listen, I wanna go out on a limb here.
I��m gonna say maybe we should avoid...

70
00:05:17,396 --> 00:05:19,755
all bowel-related items
with this particular product.

71
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,835
- Just a hunch, you know?
- Ill work up something different.

72
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:24,154
- All right. Thanks.
- Nick Beams office.

Its a done deal. New York
Philharmonic. Last night in town.

77
00:05:37,514 --> 00:05:39,473
Ill be escorting

78
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:42,792
- What about me?
- Well bring ya.

79
00:05:42,953 --> 00:05:45,912
Oh, guess what? My sister left
a message on the machine.

80
00:05:46,073 --> 00:05:48,072
And she��s coming in
with her fianc�� next Friday.

81
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:49,512
- No. Oh, wow.

82
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:52,071
I finally get to meet the
mysterious queen of the Peace Corps.

83
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:54,111
Yes, you do.
Hey, can you pick em up?

84
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:57,671
Yeah, sure. When is it?

85
00:05:57,832 --> 00:05:59,831
A week from today.

86
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:03,110
I think it��ll be around 10:30.
I��m not sure. I��ll have to check.

87
00:06:03,271 --> 00:06:05,510
P.B. wants
to see you A.S.A.P.

88
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:08,950
Sorry, honey, I gotta go. There��s
an onslaught of initials coming at me.

89
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,149
- Okay. Tell him hello.
- I will.

90
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,789

00:06:44,357 --> 00:06:47,396
Niroog, the fertility god.

101
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:51,275
Boy, I like looking at this.
Handmade in the Paleolithic period.

102
00:06:51,436 --> 00:06:54,155
Had to sacrifice my Ides of March
gold aureus in trade.

103
00:06:54,316 --> 00:06:58,555
Pity. But, uh,
I think worth it.

104
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:01,714
So, which one of you
wanted to see me?

105
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,034

You gotta help me out here.

110
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,792
I don��t get this lucky
every day.

111
00:07:18,953 --> 00:07:22,872
- Look, if this is about a woman-
- You��re a pal. I gotta go.

112
00:07:25,832 --> 00:07:27,591
- It just needs to be-
- Guess who just called?

113
00:07:29,112 --> 00:07:32,351
- Ann��s divorce lawyer?
- McGinty��s secretary. He��s rescheduling.

114
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:35,991
- All right! Yes!
- Want me to get Ann on the line?

115
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:39,910
No, I��m gonna try to beat her home.
I wanna surprise her.

116
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:42,270
This is great, huh?

117
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:02,908
- The wife again?
- No, actually I just met this incredible brunette on the elevator.

118
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,437
Well, I��m jealous. What would I
have to do to get flowers all the time?

119
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:09,517
- You don��t get flowers all the time?
- Nope.

120
00:08:09,678 --> 00:08:12,237
That��s a crime.

121
00:08:36,555 --> 00:08:38,514
Grab it! Grab it!

122
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:15,750
That��s right. That��s right.

123

125
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,758
I say fight, You��re outta the corner
a day late, a dollar short

126
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,638
Friday mornings
most people don��t get

127
00:11:16,678 --> 00:11:18,757
You change your life from left to right
You get your wit tracks tight

128
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:20,877
Must be testing the master

Soldiers over here don��t snitch
They bitch and bit

All hours while
the crowds peepin in

134
00:11:44,555 --> 00:11:47,394
Welcome to hell, bitch.

135
00:11:47,555 --> 00:11:49,314
Car, keys, wallet. Now!

136
00:11:53,034 --> 00:11:55,473
Do you hear what I said?

137
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:57,593
Okay. Now you listen,
and you listen good.

138
00:11:57,754 --> 00:12:01,433
This is a gun. Okay? Don��t be
fuckin�� around with no gun, white boy.

139
00:12:01,593 --> 00:12:03,592
Helen Keller,

140
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:06,552
I know you hear
what the fuck I��m sayin�� to you.

141
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:11,272
Boy, did you pick

142
00:12:12,312 --> 00:12:14,031
Oh!

143

Oh, shit.

Oh, you��re trying to lock me-
U- U-Unlock the door.

145
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:26,710
Stop, motherfucker!
Stop the car! Stop the car!

146
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,639
You��re driving on the sidewalk,

147
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,918
Pull over, man!
White boy, I said pull over!

148
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:52,877
Yo, man, there��s a truck.

149
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,757
I said, yo, man,

151
00:13:10,196 --> 00:13:12,755
What about my wallet?
You wanted to rob me, didn��t you?

152
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,515
Yes. I distinctly remember
you wanting to rob me.

153
00:13:15,676 --> 00:13:17,435
Here��s my wallet.
You want it?

154
00:13:17,595 --> 00:13:19,954
Here it is. Here. Here.
Right out there.

155
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:26,234
- What you doin, man? That was money.
- Oh, I��m sorry. I got something else for you.

156
00:13:26,394 --> 00:13:29,353
I��m blind!
I can��t see shit.

157
00:13:31,514 --> 00:13:36,473
The honeys dug my eyes.
The honeys loved my eyes.

158
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,078
All right, you win, man. All right?
Is that what you wanna hear? You win.

159
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,237

160
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:28,157
No, you aint one
of them desert slashers, are you?

161
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:33,157
Cut a person body up and leave it out in the
desert in little tiny pieces and shit, huh?

162
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:36,636
Oh, shit!
We are in the fucking desert.

163
00:14:36,797 --> 00:14:41,916
I��m in the car with a psycho,
freaky, Jason hack-killer motherfucker.

164
00:14:42,076 --> 00:14:45,355
Hey, please don��t kill me,
freaky Jason.

165
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:48,555
I said, please don��t kill me,
freaky Jason.

166
00:14:51,755 --> 00:14:55,674
I done fucked around and caught
a ride with the wrong white boy!

167
00:15:15,393 --> 00:15:18,152
- Get out.

168
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:21,032
��Sayo-fuckin��-- nara,���� pal.

00:15:25,752 --> 00:15:27,511
I cant feel my ass.

170
00:15:27,672 --> 00:15:30,001
My ass just fell asleep.

171
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:32,320
I didn��t even know
an ass could fall asleep!

172
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:35,120
Its all tingly and shit!

173
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:38,000
Come on, man.
You cant leave me out here.

174
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:41,640
Yo, man! You cant
just leave me out here.

175
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:10,796
Okay, Ill make
a deal with you.

176
00:16:10,957 --> 00:16:13,516
You drive me home, Ill forget
about this whole kidnapping shit.

177
00:16:13,677 --> 00:16:16,716
Oh, come on.

178
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:18,755
Hello. You tried to rob me.

179
00:16:21,156 --> 00:16:24,555
You had a gun to my head.

180
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:26,475
Look, I told you
the gun wasn��t loaded.

181
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:29,194
You got yourself into this.

182
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:32,834
You know what you are? You��re
a bad person. You��re an armed robber.

183
00:16:32,995 --> 00:16:34,634
Don��t expect me
to feel sorry for you.

184
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:37,354
Excuse me.
Is there a problem here?

185
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:39,913
- Yes.
- Is this man botherin you?

186
00:16:40,074 --> 00:16:42,873
- Yes, he is.
- Oh, so you��re just gonna come right at the brother.

187
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:44,793
Why don��t you ask
if he��s bothering me?

188
00:16:44,954 --> 00:16:47,953
Lady, for all you know,
I could be Denzel Washington.

189
00:16:48,113 --> 00:16:50,272
Take a good look.

190
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:52,792
He could be some
celebrity stalker.

191
00:16:52,953 --> 00:16:54,992
I��m gonna have to ask you
to pay for this coffee now...

192
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:57,031
cause I��ve seen these things
escalate before.

193
00:16:57,192 --> 00:17:01,681
No problem. My wallet.

194
00:17:05,681 --> 00:17:11,080
Wow! Looks like the celebrity stalker
don��t have a wallet.

195
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:14,800
Oh, well, thank you.

196
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,239
What? You want me to thank you?
So I owe you a buck.

197
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:28,358
How was you goin to get gas? You don��t
have no money, no credit cards.

198
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:31,438

199
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:34,438

203
00:17:44,477 --> 00:17:47,116
As a matter of fact, I- you know,
I like it out here in the desert.

204
00:17:47,277 --> 00:17:49,676
You know, you get
all sweaty and shit.

205
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:54,396
Just bubbling off your ass.

206
00:17:54,556 --> 00:17:56,555

207
00:17:56,716 --> 00:18:00,035
I have a spare credit card
in the side compartment.

208
00:18:10,794 --> 00:18:14,193
Uh-huh, right here!

00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:17,393

215
00:18:39,761 --> 00:18:42,000
Get the fuck on out of here, man.

216
00:18:45,161 --> 00:18:48,160
Motherf-

217
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,879
What the hell is this,
your merry-go-round move?

218
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:05,718
Yo, I understand.

219
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,717
Aha!

220
00:19:24,837 --> 00:19:26,676
Thank you.

221
00:19:37,955 --> 00:19:40,794
Hey. Oh, shit.

222
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:46,194
I didn��t know it was expired.
I never use it.

223
00:19:50,114 --> 00:19:51,873
So why are you out here?

224
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:54,433
- What do you care?
- I��m curious.

225
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:56,313
I��m a student
of human nature.

226
00:19:56,473 --> 00:19:58,602
You��re a freak
of human nature.

227
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:01,442
That��s all right.
I forgive you.

228
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:04,562
Its clear you have
woman problems.

229
00:20:04,723 --> 00:20:06,482
You��re way off base.

230
00:20:06,642 --> 00:20:09,201
- I��m off base?
- Yeah. Way off base.

231
00:20:09,322 --> 00:20:11,441
- She mess around on you?
- Look.

232
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:15,041
Even if I wanted to talk about it-
which I don��t- it wouldn��t be with you.

233
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:18,520
You give her some nastiness? I know you
gave her some serious nastiness.

234
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:22,680
- Just forget it.
- What about him? Did you fuck him up?

235
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:27,400
Did you whoop his ass? I bet you hit
that motherfucker with a bat, didn��t ya?

236
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,479
Kling! Pow! Fucked his ass up,
didn��t ya?

237
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,439
No, wait a minute. You capped him. You
capped that motherfucker, didn��t you?

238
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:36,678
That��s why you out here
in the desert, ain��t ya?

239
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:39,838
Look. I didn��t shoot him. I didn��t say
anything to my wife. I just left.

240
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:41,798
- What do you mean, you just left?
- Just left. I-

241
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:44,758
I saw them doing you know...

242
00:20:44,918 --> 00:20:49,037
and I walked away.

243
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:52,837
What a pussy.

244
00:20:52,997 --> 00:20:56,796
No wonder your woman
is sneaking behind your back, man.

245
00:20:56,957 --> 00:21:00,556
Know what your problem is? You don��t
have the respect of your woman, man.

246
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,956
That��s what it is.
Me, I got all that.

247
00:21:03,116 --> 00:21:04,915
I go home, my dinners
on the table.

248
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:06,995
Bam! I don��t wanna
hear shit, woman.

249
00:21:07,156 --> 00:21:11,035
- And if I want lovin- if I��m in the mood- I get that
too. - You��re so full of shit. What would you have done?

250
00:21:11,196 --> 00:21:14,435
Man, I would have went back to that house and
Id have pulled a Terminator on the front door.

251
00:21:14,595 --> 00:21:18,274
Boom, boom, boom! Who the fuck do you
think you��re playin�� with, woman?

252
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:21,994
Who do you think I am, some fruity pie?
I aint no fruity pie.

253
00:21:22,154 --> 00:21:24,513
I��m- I��m Nick Beam.

254
00:21:24,674 --> 00:21:26,433
That��s what I told her.
I��m Nick Beam.

255
00:21:26,594 --> 00:21:30,643
And Nick Beam aint puttin�� up

256
00:21:30,803 --> 00:21:33,762
Shed have been crying, you know? Ooh,
Nick, oh, Nick, please take me back.

257
00:21:33,923 --> 00:21:35,882
Please, please, Nick.
It was only one time. ��

258
00:21:36,043 --> 00:21:39,762
I��m gonna one time your ass.
Nick Beam is the master of his fate...

259
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,682
the ruler of his destiny.

260
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:45,521
So if you wanna cry on somebody��s
shoulder, why don��t you cry on Superdick?

261
00:21:45,682 --> 00:21:48,081
As for Nick Beam,
I��m fit, lit...

262
00:21:48,242 --> 00:21:50,961
and I damn sure

00:21:51,121 --> 00:21:55,680
So you can get the fuck out.

00:21:57,641 --> 00:22:00,120
That��s what I would

265
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,079
That��s what I
told the bitch.

266
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,119
- What the-
- Hey, hold it. Hold it.

267
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:11,558
Break it up. Break it up.
What��s goin�� on here?

268
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:15,918
Should I pay cash, or do you
wanna use your credit card?

269
00:22:40,636 --> 00:22:45,035
Ah, fu- Oh- Ah-
Oh, shit.

270
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:48,515
- Put the money in the bag. Put the money in the fuckin bag!
- Okay.

271
00:22:48,675 --> 00:22:51,754
- Shit.

You weren��t gonna leave
without me, were you?

274
00:23:00,394 --> 00:23:03,443
- What do you think you��re doing?
- There��s a special they got goin�� on.

275
00:23:03,604 --> 00:23:06,963
You get a free stack of cash
with every fill-up. Some luck, huh?

276
00:23:07,123 --> 00:23:09,362
How stupid can you be?

277
00:23:09,523 --> 00:23:12,282
- We better get out of here.
- You take that money back.

278
00:23:12,443 --> 00:23:16,242
- I��m serious, man. We better get goin��..

I��m not going anywhere until you return-

281
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:33,160
- Why? Why? Why?

282
00:23:33,321 --> 00:23:37,880
- Oh, you had money.

You robbed him at gunpoint.
You dick!

286
00:23:53,438 --> 00:23:58,317
Hey, hey, you��re the one who threw
the wallet out the fuckin�� window.

287
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,717
Smart.

299
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,639
How��d you know that hillbilly
was gonna turn first?

300
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,119
You did know he was gonna
turn first, didn��t ya?

301
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,239
You know what?
It don��t even matter.

302
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:24,198
I��m alive!
You alive, man!

303
00:25:35,918 --> 00:25:38,477
- Get out! -
What? - Get out!

304
00:25:47,996 --> 00:25:49,795
What are you even thinking when
you do something like that?

305
00:25:49,956 --> 00:25:52,515
- You think you��re never gonna get caught?
- We didn��t get caught.

306
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:55,115
That��s not the point.
It��s beetle headed.

307
00:25:55,276 --> 00:25:57,165
Its- It��s only a matter of time
before you do get caught.

308
00:25:57,315 --> 00:26:01,524
- What is beetle headed?
- Its a synonym for ����stupid. ����

309
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:06,644
Oh. Well, here��s a synonym
for ����procreation. ���� Fuck you!

310
00:26:06,804 --> 00:26:10,483
Its easy for you to point the finger when you��re
sittin�� on your rich ass in a big fuckin�� house.

311
00:26:10,644 --> 00:26:13,283
- I��m not rich.
- Oh, yeah.

312
00:26:13,444 --> 00:26:14,843
- How big is your TV?
- What?

313
00:26:15,004 --> 00:26:17,083
- I say, how big is your TV?
- Fifty-inch.

314
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:20,562
- Get in the car.
- Oh, please. Lets not make this a social issue.

315
00:26:20,723 --> 00:26:24,202
The point is that even if you wanted to rob
a place, there are smarter ways to do it.

316
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:27,922
- Enlighten me.
- A mask. Wear a mask.

317
00:26:28,082 --> 00:26:30,081
You see, the police
have this thing called a ��lineup... ����

318
00:26:30,242 --> 00:26:33,401
and if someone recognizes you,
you go to jail!

319
00:26:33,562 --> 00:26:36,281
Oh, how about this for a novel idea?
Case the place first.

320
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:40,160
Find out if there��s a security camera
or a hidden alarm.

321
00:26:40,321 --> 00:26:42,960
Then again, why even rob
a convenience store?

322
00:26:43,121 --> 00:26:45,200
How much money could you possibly get?
Two, three hundred dollars?

323
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,439
Then what? You��re set
for two days! Wow!

324
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,519
- What do you know, lanky?
- I know you go for the big score.

325
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,239
One robbery, you��re set.

326
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,599
News flash, big slim.

327
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:57,678
People with big money,
they protect it.

328
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:00,638
So you do a little research.
Take Quality Design Group where I work.

329
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,158
My boss keeps a ton of cash
in his vault.

330
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:06,318
At night, there��s only two guards
and a personal security system.

331
00:27:06,478 --> 00:27:09,237
Now, in this case,
I happen to even know the code.

332
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:11,757
But even if I didn��t, I-

333
00:27:15,317 --> 00:27:17,156
What?

334
00:27:20,837 --> 00:27:23,116
I got a booger in my nose?

335
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:26,725
What?

336
00:27:26,876 --> 00:27:28,795
Diversify.

337
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:31,205
You cant trust banks, Nick.

338
00:27:31,366 --> 00:27:35,685
The entire system
could crumble at any second.

339
00:27:35,845 --> 00:27:39,364
That bastards so heavily leveraged,
it would wipe him out.

340
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:43,044
Wait a minute.
Am I hearing you right?

341
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:46,083
Mr. ��High and Mighty����
is gonna rob his boss?

342
00:27:48,964 --> 00:27:52,083
You hear that,
gila monsters?

343
00:27:52,243 --> 00:27:54,802
Old Nick Beam here
is gonna rob his boss!

344
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:59,042
I say, do you hear that,
gila monsters?

345
00:27:59,203 --> 00:28:02,962
You know what, Nick? Your wife really
messed your head up bad, man.

346
00:28:06,522 --> 00:28:08,521
You��re serious?

347
00:28:10,761 --> 00:28:15,120
- How much he got?
- Only the bulk of his personal assets.

348
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:20,280
- Six, seven hundred thousand.
- You what?

349
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,439
- Hey, you gonna need some help.
- Oh, no, this has nothing to do with you.

350
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,439
Hey, I was present at the time
of creative inspiration...

351
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,839
which entitles me
to partial ownership...

352
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:33,278
in this
criminalistic endeavor.

353
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:37,518
- Get out.
- Maybe Ill just call Quality Design Group when we get back.

354
00:28:40,598 --> 00:28:41,917
I want half.

355
00:28:44,478 --> 00:28:46,917
Were gonna bury
this asshole.

356
00:28:47,078 --> 00:28:48,917
Sure, you��re right.

357
00:28:57,766 --> 00:29:00,555
If you ever plan

358
00:29:00,726 --> 00:29:02,485
To motor West

359
00:29:04,566 --> 00:29:07,445
Travel my way
Take the highway

360
00:29:07,605 --> 00:29:10,404
That��s the best

361
00:29:10,565 --> 00:29:13,284
Come on
Get your kicks

362
00:29:13,445 --> 00:29:15,284
On Route Sixty-

363
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:26,723
Six

364
00:29:28,483 --> 00:29:31,122
Well, it winds from Chicago

365
00:29:31,283 --> 00:29:33,122
To L.A.

366
00:29:35,283 --> 00:29:37,922
More than 2,000 miles

367
00:29:40,842 --> 00:29:44,401
- Highway shooters?
- One black, one white. You tell me?

368
00:29:44,562 --> 00:29:46,281
You were there,
and they got away?

369
00:29:46,441 --> 00:29:50,280
They were driving
a 1996 Yukon.

370
00:29:52,681 --> 00:29:56,680
- License?
- You know, if I had a license number, Bart, I wouldn��t be standing here...

371
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,239
- eating large quantities of shit, now, would I?
- No, sir.

372
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,759
Monitor calls on both sides of the border.
Fax that photo to every precinct on the planet.

373
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,119
There��s so much as a sneeze
out there I wanna feel the mist.

374
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:22,757
I hear a voice

375
00:30:22,918 --> 00:30:25,167
- Give me all your money and a Yoo Hoo.
- The moneys all locked up.

376
00:30:29,087 --> 00:30:31,326
That��ll be 79 cents, please.

377
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,925
I said
Come on, little prisoner

378
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:38,645
I got something to say

379
00:30:49,085 --> 00:30:51,964
Something stinks, man.

380
00:30:52,124 --> 00:30:54,563
You sure you aint got
a gas leak?

381
00:30:54,724 --> 00:30:58,123
- Its my shoes.
- Your shoes?

382
00:31:00,724 --> 00:31:02,803
You ever heard of Dr Scholl��s?

383
00:31:02,963 --> 00:31:06,122
I spilled some gas on my shoes
at the gas station.

384
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:08,842
You know,
the one you robbed.

385
00:31:10,483 --> 00:31:13,362
- Oh, so you got a camcorder up in here.
- What are you doing?

386
00:31:13,522 --> 00:31:14,921
I��m just
checkin�� it out, man.

387
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:17,681
- Pu- Pu- Put it down.
- I aint gonna break it, man.

388
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:21,201
Just let me check it out.
Just let me see.

389
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,640
Yo, this is your wife?

390
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:29,040
Man, I see why
you were upset.

391
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:32,760
Not bad, Nick.
Not bad, Nick.

392
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,879
I mean, you know,
for a cheatin bitch.

393
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,319
Look, don��t you call her that.

394
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,599
You- You don��t know her.
Don��t call her that.

395
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:42,518
Okay. No disrespect. Okay?

396
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,838
What should I call her?

397
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:49,358
Monogamously challenged?

398
00:31:51,238 --> 00:31:53,357
- God.
- I was just fuckin with you, man.

399
00:31:53,528 --> 00:31:55,447
You know, this is an all right camera
for a regular eight.

400
00:31:55,598 --> 00:31:59,207
- Its the best on the market.
- Let me explain something to you, Nick.

401
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:02,766
If you aint got digital,
you ain��t got shit.

402
00:32:02,927 --> 00:32:05,166
This has only got
one C.C.D. chip.

403
00:32:05,327 --> 00:32:08,046
Broadcast has three, Nick.

404
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:11,565
Don��t look at me like that.
What, are you surprised I know shit?

405
00:32:11,726 --> 00:32:14,965
The guy that sold me that camera
just set up our computer network.

406
00:32:15,126 --> 00:32:18,805
- Windows NT?
- No. Just Windows.

407
00:32:18,965 --> 00:32:21,884
- Man, get out of here with that shit.
- Look, here��s a nutty idea.

408
00:32:22,045 --> 00:32:25,844
If you actually know something about this
stuff, why not use that knowledge and get a job?

409
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:27,844
Take a good look at me.

410
00:32:28,004 --> 00:32:30,723
- I��m not exactly the corporate color.
- That��s ridiculous.

411
00:32:30,884 --> 00:32:34,483
- If you wanted a job, you could have one.
- There��s a spider on your head.

412
00:32:34,644 --> 00:32:37,483
- What?
- There��s a spider on your head.

413
00:32:37,643 --> 00:32:40,002
Look, I am sorry.
I am not up on all this...

414
00:32:40,163 --> 00:32:41,922
jive-talkin, homeboy lingo.

415
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:45,042
What��s that supposed to mean,
there��s a spider on your head?

416
00:32:45,203 --> 00:32:49,162
It means: There��s a spider on
your motherfuckin�� head, man.

417
00:32:49,322 --> 00:32:51,881
Well, get it off!
Get it off, get it off!

418
00:32:52,042 --> 00:32:54,481
- I aint touchin�� that shit.
- Get it off!

419
00:32:54,642 --> 00:32:56,401
Get it off, get it off,
get if off, get if off!

420
00:32:56,561 --> 00:33:00,840
- Get it off!
- Yo, that��s a big fuckin�� spider, man.

421
00:33:01,001 --> 00:33:02,640
Oh, shit!

422
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,719
Nick, its just a spider.

423
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,439
I��m a scat man

424
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,039
No, no.
Now don��t go crazy.

425
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:20,198
- Yeah, you go, boy.
- I��m a scat man

426
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:25,808
Hold on, let me focus.
Let me focus on this shit.

427
00:33:25,968 --> 00:33:29,327
I��m a scat man

428
00:33:29,488 --> 00:33:32,527
Oh, shit.

429
00:33:40,047 --> 00:33:43,646
You got the hot foot!
Yo, Nick!

430
00:33:43,806 --> 00:33:46,965
Get on the good foot.
Get on the good-

431
00:33:49,046 --> 00:33:52,845
Aw, got it!

432
00:34:08,884 --> 00:34:10,723
I��m a scat man

433
00:34:16,403 --> 00:34:18,322
I��m a scat man

434
00:34:39,281 --> 00:34:41,040
I gotta make a call.
You pump.

435
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,679
- Give me the gun.
- What?

436
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,799
Give me the gun.

437
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,319
Man, I wasn��t gonna
rob the place, man.

438
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:52,318
Then you wont need this.

439
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:54,238
Then you wont need this.

440
00:35:04,528 --> 00:35:06,287
You must be really fast.

441
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:12,886
Twenty dollars on pump number 15
and a sour fruity twist.

442
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:20,286
- You a cop?
- No.

443
00:35:20,446 --> 00:35:23,045
You bastards have tried this
too many times!

444
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:24,965
- Oh, listen-
- Shut up!

445
00:35:25,126 --> 00:35:27,605
- I wasn��t gonna-
- Shut up.

446
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:37,404
Emmett County Sheriffs Station.
Hello. Hello.

447
00:35:37,564 --> 00:35:40,123
- Uh-
- Yes, may I help you?

448
00:35:40,244 --> 00:35:43,483
That show, Cops...

449
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:45,803
I love it.

450
00:35:45,964 --> 00:35:48,323
Have you ever had
a really bad day?

451
00:35:50,323 --> 00:35:52,082
I��m havin�� one right now.

452
00:35:52,243 --> 00:35:54,842
Now, look, baby,
I told you Id be home later.

453
00:35:55,003 --> 00:35:58,842
Now, this guy say he got a job
for me, okay, payin big money.

454
00:35:59,002 --> 00:36:01,961
Okay, now, please, don��t argue with me.
Not-Not now. All right?

455
00:36:02,122 --> 00:36:04,361
Ill see you later. Okay.

456
00:36:12,401 --> 00:36:14,160
Oh, oh. Oh.

457
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:18,480
Now all I wants $20 on pump number 15
and a sour fruity twist.

458
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,199
- Is that too much to ask?
- No, sir.

459
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:24,969
- Do you mind if I take your gun?
- No, sir.

460
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,398
Would you please rip the phone cord
out of the wall?

461
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:32,568
- What?
- Would you rip the phone cord out of the wall, please?

462
00:36:32,729 --> 00:36:37,528
Thank you. This is for the phone and for
the gun and for the sour fruity twist.

463
00:36:37,688 --> 00:36:43,287
And $20 on pump number 15. Go on.

464
00:36:43,448 --> 00:36:45,367
- Thank you for your patience.
- Yes, sir.

465
00:36:49,087 --> 00:36:51,126
Le- Let me get this straight.

466
00:36:51,287 --> 00:36:54,006
Its all right for you to rob a place,
but it ain��t all right for me?

467
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:55,925
I didn��t rob him.

468
00:36:56,086 --> 00:36:59,005
Well, you got a funny way
of not robbin a motherfucker.

469
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:01,525
Nick, lets get out of here,
man, before he calls the cops.

470
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:03,445
- He��s not gonna call the cops.
- How do you know?

471
00:37:03,605 --> 00:37:06,364
I had him rip the phone cord
out of the wall.

472
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:09,444
Oh, shoot.
That��s pretty good.

473
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:11,804
And you got his gun?

474
00:37:11,965 --> 00:37:15,284
Not bad, Nicholas.
Not bad.

475
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,369
Charlie, this shits depressing the shit
out of me. It��s makin�� me sad.

476
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:57,409
What? Oh, come on, man.
This shit is the shit.

477
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,609
- This is the shit. Its supposed to make you sad.
- It��s grim.

478
00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:01,568
Oh, man, come on.
This is the shit.

479
00:38:01,729 --> 00:38:06,568
This shit is the shit.
This is the hellified love music.

480
00:38:06,729 --> 00:38:09,008
- I��m in bad shape over here.
- Ah, man, you know, maybe I can...

481
00:38:09,169 --> 00:38:13,808
tune you in to a nice A.M. station
and get you some Donny Osmond.

482
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:20,247
- Charlie, what��s this? Slow down.
- Get the fuck out of here.

483
00:38:20,407 --> 00:38:22,806
Pull over and
turn the headlights off.

484
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,725
Yo, man, you could��ve
gotten me a piece of licorice.

485
00:38:36,886 --> 00:38:39,125
- Its sour.
- So.

486
00:38:39,285 --> 00:38:41,364
Still could��ve gotten me a piece.

487
00:38:41,525 --> 00:38:44,084
- I didn��t think of it.
- Oh, you didn��t think of it.

488
00:38:44,205 --> 00:38:46,644
Just selfish, man.
Guess that��s the world.

489
00:38:46,805 --> 00:38:50,164
- You know? You just- You just selfish.
- Here.

490
00:39:07,322 --> 00:39:09,081
Damn.

491
00:39:09,242 --> 00:39:13,601
I swear, white people must got
totally different taste buds, man.

492
00:39:13,762 --> 00:39:15,921
That��s a very
racist thing to say.

493
00:39:16,081 --> 00:39:19,040
Oh, yeah? Good.

494
00:39:24,211 --> 00:39:26,770
What the f-

495
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,929
- Oh, shit!
- Whoa, they��re rammin�� us.

496
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:34,169
Thanks for the late-breakin news.
Step on the gas, Nick!

497
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,569
I hate new cars.

498
00:39:36,729 --> 00:39:38,688
Whoa!

499
00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:45,448
Look at his face, man.

500
00:39:45,608 --> 00:39:48,647
Look, man!

501
00:39:51,768 --> 00:39:54,407
Our turf, baby.

502
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:23,804
They don��t look like cops.

503
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:25,803
Definitely not cops.

504
00:40:25,964 --> 00:40:28,523
Get out of the car.

505
00:40:31,204 --> 00:40:35,123
- There you go.
- All right, motherfuckers, back the fuck off!

506
00:40:40,203 --> 00:40:43,082
Oh, shit. Its cool.

507
00:40:45,362 --> 00:40:47,521
Oh, yeah, I��m cool.
We cool.

508
00:40:47,682 --> 00:40:49,441
I was just fuckin
with y��all, man.

509
00:40:49,602 --> 00:40:51,361
Hey, what��s up?
Y��all-Y��all live around here?

510
00:40:51,521 --> 00:40:55,320
Bring your ass
around the front of the car.

511
00:40:55,481 --> 00:40:59,690
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.
There you go. There you go.

512
00:40:59,851 --> 00:41:03,530
- All right. Okay. Oh, shit. -
Uh-huh. Watch your feet. - Uh-huh.

513
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:06,489
Come on, rubber legs. Lets go.
Watch where you��re walkin��..

514
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:09,209
Watch- Watch your feet.
There you go, baby.

515
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,729
Perhaps you two haven��t heard
that my partner and I here...

516
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:15,128
own the rights to all violent crime
on this particular stretch of highway.

517
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:19,248
And we don��t take kindly to any
unauthorized criminal activities.

518
00:41:19,409 --> 00:41:21,968
You don��t understand.
We were-

519
00:41:22,088 --> 00:41:24,807
- Oh, shit.
- That��s my car.

520
00:41:24,968 --> 00:41:27,407
- Can I have your attention, please?
- Yeah.

521
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:31,447
I bet you used to sell more Girl Scout cookies
than any other member of the whole troop, didn��t ya?

522
00:41:31,607 --> 00:41:35,166
What were you calling yourself back
then? Yolanda, you little bitch?

523
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:37,366
Cynthia? Susan? What was it?
I cant remember.

524
00:41:37,527 --> 00:41:39,926
- Hey, guys, I will be gentle. Don��t even worry about it.
- Huh?

525
00:41:40,086 --> 00:41:42,965
Now- Now, don��t even worry.

526
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,445
Uh-huh.

527
00:41:47,446 --> 00:41:49,205
I have these.

528
00:41:49,365 --> 00:41:51,444
Oh, now that��s not
gonna be enough.

529
00:41:51,605 --> 00:41:54,484
Where��d you put your booty?

530
00:42:01,484 --> 00:42:06,643
Now I��ve done it. I finally found
someone I like less than you.

531
00:42:06,804 --> 00:42:10,163
Shit. That��s
a fancy case, friend.

532
00:42:10,323 --> 00:42:12,882
You know, when a sweet-mouthed girl
like you has a fancy case like this...

533
00:42:13,043 --> 00:42:16,562
a man gets to thinkin
where��s the wallet?

534
00:42:16,722 --> 00:42:19,761
That��s it.
We��re dead, man.

535
00:42:19,922 --> 00:42:21,601
I��m gonna need
that wallet, Alice.

536
00:42:21,762 --> 00:42:25,691
Where��s that big, fat wallet?
Give it to me.

537
00:42:25,852 --> 00:42:28,411
Give me your fuckin wallet,
you little bitch.

538
00:42:30,931 --> 00:42:33,050
- You know what?
- Nick, Nick, what you doin?

539
00:42:33,211 --> 00:42:35,290
I��m sure you��re
a really scary guy.

540
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:39,210
I��m sure that, normally, people just
quiver at the very sound of your voice.

541
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:42,849
But, you see, I, I cant
see that right now.

542
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:47,089
I- I-I just see a weak,
desperate little man...

543
00:42:47,249 --> 00:42:49,968
that probably grew up
torturing little animals.

544
00:42:50,129 --> 00:42:51,928
Some puny, little uncoordinated...

545
00:42:52,089 --> 00:42:56,368
cant-make-the-football-team- so-I��ll-pick-on-third-graders-
and-steal-their-lunch-money...

546
00:42:56,528 --> 00:42:58,967
punk, jerk-off bully...

547
00:42:59,128 --> 00:43:01,287
that one day wakes up
and realizes he��s nothing.

548
00:43:01,448 --> 00:43:05,407
Just a sad, pathetic, useless,
illiterate piece of inbred shit.

549
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:09,806
I just want you to know,
I totally disagree.

550
00:43:18,006 --> 00:43:21,445
- Time to die.
- That just makes you my best friend.

551
00:43:23,565 --> 00:43:26,164
All right,
drop the fuckin gun.

552
00:43:26,325 --> 00:43:29,164
Drop the fuckin gun!

553
00:43:29,325 --> 00:43:31,084
Give me this, motherfucker.

554
00:43:31,245 --> 00:43:33,964
Now back the fuck up before
I kick you in your bitch-ass chin.

555
00:43:34,124 --> 00:43:37,283
Back the fuck up!
I said, back the fuck up!

556
00:43:37,444 --> 00:43:40,243
Didn��t I say, back the fuck up?
Everybody, back the fuck up.

557
00:43:40,404 --> 00:43:43,123
Oh!

558
00:43:44,603 --> 00:43:49,082
Shit.

559
00:43:49,243 --> 00:43:50,962
- You shot me.
- I��m sorry, Nick.

560
00:43:51,123 --> 00:43:54,202
- Put down the gun.
- Shut up.

561
00:43:54,362 --> 00:43:57,851
- You shot me. - I said, I��m
sorry, man. I- I-I didn��t mean it.

562
00:43:58,012 --> 00:43:59,851
The gun just went off.

563
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,251
You know, I have that
same trouble in bed.

564
00:44:02,411 --> 00:44:05,450
Well, rarely. Every once
in a great while.

565
00:44:05,611 --> 00:44:08,890
- Put down that gun, you idiot.
- Would you shut up? I��m shot here.

566
00:44:09,051 --> 00:44:11,530
You shut the fuck up.
Who the hell do you think you are?

567
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,009
- You shut the fuck up! You shut the fuck
up! - Huh? Look at yourself, you candy-ass-

568
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:16,169
- Man, you shut the fuck up. -
You shut the fuck up. - Shut up!

569
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:19,609
- Put down the gun! - Hey, hey, hey! - Put that
fucking gun down before you take a fucking toe hit.

570
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:23,049
- You shut the fuck up! - I don��t give a shit!
- Shut the fuck up! - Candy-ass motherfucker!

571
00:44:23,209 --> 00:44:26,008
- Shut the fuck up, man! - Shut
the fuck up! - Hey, hey, hey!

572
00:44:26,169 --> 00:44:29,128
Hey! Everybody,
shut the fuck up!

573
00:44:29,289 --> 00:44:31,528
Now, everybody,
shut the fuck up!

574
00:44:31,688 --> 00:44:33,367
Especially you.
Shut the fuck up.

575
00:44:33,528 --> 00:44:35,767
You like Girl Scout cookies?
Come here. Come here.

576
00:44:35,928 --> 00:44:37,847
You want cookie?
Here��s a cookie.

577
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:41,287
Now back the fuck up like I done
told you two dumb-ass mother-

578
00:44:41,447 --> 00:44:43,606
Back up, back up.

579
00:44:47,927 --> 00:44:51,526
Get in the car, Nick!
Look at you now.

580
00:44:53,686 --> 00:44:55,445
That��s good.

581
00:44:55,606 --> 00:44:57,845
Bye, cowboys!

582
00:45:13,004 --> 00:45:16,003
Nick, why the hell you start up
with that guy, man?

583
00:45:16,164 --> 00:45:19,523
- You shot me.
- I��m sorry.

584
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:23,852
- You shot me.
- I��m sorry.

585
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:27,132
You don��t say you��re sorry
when you shoot someone.

586
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:29,531
You say you��re sorry when
you step on someone��s toe...

587
00:45:29,692 --> 00:45:31,891
or you accidentally
break their glasses...

588
00:45:32,052 --> 00:45:34,051
or you, you fart
while they��re eating.

589
00:45:34,212 --> 00:45:36,771
You- You don��t say you��re sorry
when you shoot someone!

590
00:45:36,891 --> 00:45:39,250
Shit.

591
00:45:39,411 --> 00:45:42,810
Oh, my God. Its going numb.
It��s going numb. It��s going numb.

592
00:45:42,971 --> 00:45:45,650
What?

593
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,089
Shit.

594
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:57,329
Oh, my God!

595
00:45:57,489 --> 00:46:00,088
Nick, that��s the most
hideous thing I ever seen.

596
00:46:00,249 --> 00:46:03,248
Hey, yo, man, you know,
maybe if you wrap your arm in ice...

597
00:46:03,409 --> 00:46:05,968
they can reattach it.

598
00:46:09,208 --> 00:46:11,767
That��s funny, man.

599
00:46:11,928 --> 00:46:15,487
- That��s a baby gash.
- Shut up.

600
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:19,086
- But its a baby gash.
- It could��ve been a lot worse. It could��ve been a lot worse!

601
00:46:19,247 --> 00:46:22,006
- It could��ve been, but it wasn��t. I��m
gonna- - What are you thinking, shooting?

602
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:23,926
Look, just calm down,
all right?

603
00:46:24,086 --> 00:46:27,525
You��re gonna upset your wound.

604
00:46:47,844 --> 00:46:49,683
Yeah. Do you folks
want a lift somewhere?

605
00:46:49,844 --> 00:46:51,533
- Where you from?
- London.

606
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:53,413
- Me too!
- Really?

607
00:46:53,573 --> 00:46:55,052
- Yeah!
- That��s terrific.

608
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:59,812
Hop in me car. Lets go then.
Come on. Jump in. Let��s go.

609
00:46:59,973 --> 00:47:03,572
- Oh, this is great.
- Hey, would you scoot over a smidgen?

610
00:47:06,252 --> 00:47:08,411
Sorry about that.
Cheers, mate.

611
00:47:13,171 --> 00:47:16,250
- Nick Beam.
- Where we headed?

612
00:47:16,411 --> 00:47:18,410
L.A.

613
00:47:20,411 --> 00:47:22,130
City of Angels.

614
00:47:31,089 --> 00:47:33,688
So where you plan
on staying tonight?

615
00:47:33,849 --> 00:47:36,728
- Ill just sleep in the car.
- Yeah, right.

616
00:47:36,889 --> 00:47:39,608
You can stay at my place,
brother.

617
00:47:39,769 --> 00:47:42,328
Thanks.
Well, just for the night.

618
00:47:42,448 --> 00:47:44,567
What? Did you think
I was asking you to move in?

619
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:47,207
- No, I was just sayin-
- Please, Mr. Beam.

620
00:47:47,368 --> 00:47:51,007
- Stay with me forever.
- Just shut up.

621
00:47:51,167 --> 00:47:54,326
- Mr. Beam.
- Shut up.

622
00:47:54,487 --> 00:47:57,046
- Mr. Beam, Mr. Beam, Mr. Beam.
- You know how to shut up?

623
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,966
- Mr. Beam.
- Is it in your vocabulary?

624
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,325
- Stay with me forever, Mr. Beam.
- Is it possible? Do you ever shut up?

625
00:48:01,486 --> 00:48:04,085
Will you stay with me
forever, Mr. Beam?

626
00:48:25,334 --> 00:48:28,213
Look here.
When you meet my wife...

627
00:48:28,373 --> 00:48:30,492
she don��t know nothing��
about my sideline gig.

628
00:48:30,653 --> 00:48:33,932
- You mean she doesn��t know you��re a thief?
- Hey, I��m not a thief, okay?

629
00:48:34,093 --> 00:48:37,532
I just dabble
in future used goods.

630
00:48:37,692 --> 00:48:41,371
- Well, what does she think you do all day?
- Look for work, man.

631
00:48:43,932 --> 00:48:48,171
Maybe if you did look for work,
you wouldn��t have to steal.

632
00:48:48,331 --> 00:48:50,490
Don��t judge me.

633
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:00,169
You stepped on my shoe.

634
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:02,569
See, I don��t usually
get in this late.

635
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:07,849
Baby, am I glad
to see you.

636
00:49:08,009 --> 00:49:11,568
No, no, no. No, talk to me.
Explain this to me now.

637
00:49:11,729 --> 00:49:14,888
I got mugged.

638
00:49:15,048 --> 00:49:17,527
- Okay, I didn��t get mugged.
- I got-

639
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:22,247
- I got mugged. He got beat up.
- Thank-

640
00:49:22,408 --> 00:49:24,767
Remember how I was telling you
I had a job interview?

641
00:49:24,927 --> 00:49:26,686
Baby, that��s him.
He right there.

642
00:49:26,847 --> 00:49:30,206
That��s the player
right there.

643
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:35,206
My names Nick. Nick Beam.
Nice to meet you.

644
00:49:35,366 --> 00:49:38,125
When are you gonna stop
getting into trouble, Terrance?

645
00:49:38,286 --> 00:49:39,885
- Terrance?
- ��TT.����

646
00:49:40,046 --> 00:49:43,645
Okay? My friends call me ��TT.����
You can kiss my ass. Boo!

647
00:49:43,805 --> 00:49:45,964
- Okay, Terrance.
- Oh, Mama.

648
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:49,684
Please go on
back to bed, Mama.

649
00:49:49,845 --> 00:49:52,574
What kind of man stays out
till 2:30 in the morning...

650
00:49:52,725 --> 00:49:54,494
then comes back lookin
like a bruised turd?

651
00:49:54,644 --> 00:49:57,123
- Mama, I aint-
- Don��t you talk back.

652
00:49:57,294 --> 00:50:00,573
Don��t talk back
to your mother.

653
00:50:00,734 --> 00:50:02,933
W- What- What��d I do?

654
00:50:03,093 --> 00:50:04,892
You got that slap
cause you with him.

655
00:50:05,053 --> 00:50:08,692
- And I know you��re part of whatever badness he��s into.
- Mama, enough.

656
00:50:08,853 --> 00:50:11,292
You got some explaining
to do in the morning, Mr. Gentleman.

657
00:50:11,453 --> 00:50:14,252
Now you think on that.

658
00:50:18,892 --> 00:50:22,451
Why do you keep on
smacking me, Mama?

659
00:50:24,531 --> 00:50:26,690
Okay.

660
00:50:28,251 --> 00:50:32,330
- Shh.
- No, go ahead. Go ahead.

661
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:33,969
- Okay.
- Oh.

662
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,329
Okay, now you come here.
Come here.

663
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:41,049
Mama didn��t have to
smack me three times.

664
00:50:45,449 --> 00:50:48,968
- We gotta move out of here.
- I know.

665
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:54,048
- I know.
- I heard gunshots.

666
00:50:54,208 --> 00:50:57,847
Hey, there, boy. Hey, what
you doing up this late, pal?

667
00:50:58,008 --> 00:51:00,647
Huh? What��s up?
What are you doing up this late?

668
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,886
Oh, honey, we woke you.

669
00:51:04,047 --> 00:51:06,486
Now look, don��t worry.
Give Daddy a kiss. Come on.

670
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:10,206
Don��t worry. I ain��t gonna let nothing��
happen to y��all. You know that, right?

671
00:51:10,366 --> 00:51:15,285
- What happened to your face?
- No, I��m cool, little man.

672
00:51:15,446 --> 00:51:17,285
Hey, you do your homework?

673
00:51:17,446 --> 00:51:19,045
- Yes, sir.
- I said, did you do your homework?

674
00:51:19,205 --> 00:51:21,054
- Hmm? Hmm?
- Y- Yes, sir.

675
00:51:21,205 --> 00:51:25,604
- What about you, little miss? Did you do all your homework?
- I don��t have any homework.

676
00:51:25,775 --> 00:51:29,654
You don��t have no homework? All right,
time to go back to bed. Let��s go.

677
00:51:29,814 --> 00:51:34,333
Hut-two-three-four
Make a right at the right door

678
00:51:34,494 --> 00:51:38,893
Make your choice cause you got
to grow up to be successful

679
00:51:39,053 --> 00:51:42,372
- I hope this isn��t an inconvenience for you.
- Not at all.

680
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:46,652
You seem like a nice man. Terrance
can use a few of those in his life.

681
00:51:46,813 --> 00:51:49,052
- Good night.
- Good night.

682
00:51:49,212 --> 00:51:51,051
Thanks.

683
00:51:55,892 --> 00:51:57,651
Hey.

684
00:53:56,209 --> 00:53:59,408
You know, I never noticed before,
but you got really nice eyes.

685
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,648
- Shut up!
- But you do.

686
00:54:01,808 --> 00:54:06,167
Lets get this over with. I can��t believe it.
I��m committing armed robbery for two flashlights.

687
00:54:06,328 --> 00:54:09,247
Hey, don��t worry about it.
Let��s go.

688
00:54:25,656 --> 00:54:27,655
Freeze, motherfucker!

689
00:54:27,816 --> 00:54:31,775
You move your ass so much
as an inch, Ill blow it off!

690
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:35,414
- You hear me, motherfucker?
- Hey. - You hear me? What?

691
00:54:35,575 --> 00:54:40,094
- Why you acting so mean?
- Hey, look, man. Now aint the fuckin�� time, all right?

692
00:54:40,254 --> 00:54:43,133
- You say scary shit, it scares em.
- Yeah, but you have a gun.

693
00:54:43,294 --> 00:54:46,173
Plus, what you��re doing
is a stereotypical robber thing.

694
00:54:46,334 --> 00:54:51,253
I mean, its a lot scarier if someone with
a gun is calm and cool and collected, man.

695
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:54,452
- That��s bullshit, man. Don��t-
- Here.

696
00:54:54,613 --> 00:54:58,492
Excuse me, sir. Come here.

697
00:54:58,652 --> 00:55:02,651
Come here. Come here.

698
00:55:04,932 --> 00:55:08,411
Now, look, Henry...

699
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:11,370
were gonna take
some things outta here...

700
00:55:11,531 --> 00:55:14,530
and you��re just gonna
stand there.

701
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:20,729
- You got a problem with that?
- No.

702
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:24,889
Good.

703
00:55:26,609 --> 00:55:31,008
Now, honestly, which one
did you think was scarier?

704
00:55:32,889 --> 00:55:35,928
- Honestly?
- Mm-hmm.

705
00:55:37,408 --> 00:55:39,447
He was scarier.

706
00:55:39,608 --> 00:55:43,687
Really? You didn��t find
what he did contrived?

707
00:55:43,848 --> 00:55:48,167
- No. It was scary.
- Well, what part?

708
00:55:48,327 --> 00:55:52,406
Well, the, uh, ��Freeze, motherfucker����
part was scary.

709
00:55:52,567 --> 00:55:56,176
And then he led me to believe
that if I moved my ass...

710
00:55:56,336 --> 00:55:58,815
it, it might be blown off.

711
00:56:02,376 --> 00:56:06,135
- You were scary too.
- Oh, come on. You��re just saying that. You don��t have to lie.

712
00:56:06,295 --> 00:56:09,054
No, I��m not. I thought
you were very scary.

713
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,974
- Really?
- Yeah.

714
00:56:11,135 --> 00:56:14,494
- Well, thank you, Henry.
- Yo, check it out.

715
00:56:14,654 --> 00:56:17,053
They��re flashlights
with A.M./F.M. radio on it.

716
00:56:17,214 --> 00:56:21,533
They all that. You can listen to
your music while the lights on, boy.

717
00:56:21,694 --> 00:56:23,573
All right, all right!

718
00:56:23,733 --> 00:56:26,812
Come on. Come on.

719
00:56:31,213 --> 00:56:34,532
Freeze, sucker-bitch!

720
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:37,331
That was much better.

721
00:56:37,492 --> 00:56:40,971
Thank you, Henry.
See ya later now.

722
00:56:41,132 --> 00:56:43,931
What the hell is
��sucker-bitch����??

723
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:04,689
I wanna live in the jungle

724
00:57:04,849 --> 00:57:07,968
Where you don��t got
to wear no clothes

725
00:57:08,129 --> 00:57:10,848
And they got no boutiques

726
00:57:11,008 --> 00:57:13,007
Nothing chic

727
00:57:13,168 --> 00:57:16,047
In the jungle
they don��t have no disco

728
00:57:16,208 --> 00:57:18,407
Yo, yo, Rig!

729
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:20,647
Hey, yo, Rig!

730
00:57:20,817 --> 00:57:23,856
Yeah, come on over here
and meet Ginger and Mary Ann.

731
00:57:26,857 --> 00:57:28,656
Ow! God!

732
00:57:28,817 --> 00:57:31,096
Charlie, we gotta go!

733
00:58:24,931 --> 00:58:27,970
Go, go, go, go, go, go

734
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,809
Go, go, go, go, go, go

735
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:34,329
- Break, break
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

736
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:36,329
- Hey, Nick, what floor is it on?
- Fifteenth.

737
00:58:36,489 --> 00:58:38,808
- What- What- What fifteenth?
- Come on.

738
00:58:38,969 --> 00:58:40,808
Why cant we just
use the elevator?

739
00:58:40,969 --> 00:58:44,048
- Cause there��s a guard that patrols the building.
- This is bullshit!

740
00:58:45,209 --> 00:58:47,288
Come on, man. Its Saturday night.
They��re not gonna be there anyway.

741
00:58:47,448 --> 00:58:49,327
Look, I know were gonna go
back Monday and we��re gonna get him.

742
00:58:49,488 --> 00:58:52,057
I just wanna check it out.
Take a left here, will you?

743
00:58:52,178 --> 00:58:55,617
You seriously busted up my party.
You know that.

744
00:58:55,767 --> 00:58:58,256
Those girls were attracted to you. I
mean, Christ��s sake, they��re only human.

745
00:58:58,417 --> 00:59:00,896
- You��re a handsome man. We will go back.
- I��ll hold you to that.

746
00:59:01,057 --> 00:59:03,696
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm. What��s the matter with you?

747
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:09,375
- You sharp.
- Okay. - Yeah.

748
00:59:16,855 --> 00:59:18,574
Beat you.

749
00:59:18,735 --> 00:59:21,334
- I carried the damn bag.
- I still beat you.

750
00:59:21,495 --> 00:59:24,094
Beat me at what?
Climbing steps?

751
00:59:25,494 --> 00:59:28,093
Guess well call you
the ����Step King. ����

752
00:59:33,493 --> 00:59:35,492
Oh, shit.

753
00:59:37,413 --> 00:59:39,532
No problem.
I know the code.

754
00:59:45,052 --> 00:59:47,811
- What?
- Come on. Come on.

755
00:59:49,572 --> 00:59:53,811
Shit! That asshole
must��ve changed the code.

756
00:59:53,971 --> 00:59:56,530
Step aside. Let me take a look.
Let me take a look.

757
00:59:56,651 --> 00:59:58,610
Okay, let me look.
Mm-hmm.

758
01:00:01,451 --> 01:00:05,770
- What are you gonna do?
- You got 12 possible stations here. You��re only using seven.

759
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:09,689
I��m gonna make the other five stations
active, run a test mode...

760
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:12,089
and force the system
into rotation.

761
01:00:12,249 --> 01:00:14,208
What does that mean?

762
01:00:17,289 --> 01:00:19,418
We got five minutes.

763
01:00:27,858 --> 01:00:30,657
Here. Put on your mask.

764
01:00:30,817 --> 01:00:34,296
Is that mask sweaty? I think
that��s the one I hid behind my balls.

765
01:00:36,377 --> 01:00:37,816
All right.

766
01:01:00,134 --> 01:01:02,893
- Yeah, all right.
- All right, all right.

767
01:01:03,054 --> 01:01:06,173
Ooh, yeah. Lets go.
We got three minutes. Let��s go.

768
01:01:06,334 --> 01:01:08,653
- Lookin good.
- Yeah.

769
01:01:08,813 --> 01:01:12,652
Put the money in there.
Lets go. All right. Let��s go.

770
01:01:14,413 --> 01:01:18,572
Here we go. Money. Money.

771
01:01:18,732 --> 01:01:20,971
Lets go. Mask, mask.

772
01:01:24,092 --> 01:01:27,451
Lets go, baby.
Let��s go, baby. Let��s go!

773
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:44,729
What the hell are you doin?
Nick?

774
01:01:49,969 --> 01:01:53,218
Okay, that��s real clever, Nick.
Let��s go.

775
01:01:56,018 --> 01:01:58,097
Come on, man.

776
01:02:05,857 --> 01:02:09,296
This is very nice.
Its very nice. It��s very nice.

777
01:02:09,457 --> 01:02:12,536
Oh. I don��t think I��ve ever seen
a more beautiful piece of shit.

778
01:02:12,697 --> 01:02:14,536
Nick. Nick!

779
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:17,256
Very nice. Very nice.
Very nice.

780
01:02:22,216 --> 01:02:24,255
Yeah!

781
01:02:24,415 --> 01:02:27,894
That��s great. That��s great.
You done cut the dick off a statue.

782
01:02:31,775 --> 01:02:33,614
How��s it feel, Phillip?

783
01:02:33,775 --> 01:02:38,174
You had it all, but it wasn��t enough
for you. You had to mess with me.

784
01:02:39,654 --> 01:02:42,533
Nobody messes with Nick Beam.

785
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:14,449
I feel lucky

786
01:03:15,610 --> 01:03:18,209
I just feel that way

787
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:23,419
I��m on a bus to Atlantic City

788
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:27,018
Later on today

789
01:03:30,299 --> 01:03:33,418
- Your face, man. You showed your face.
- It doesn��t matter.

790
01:03:33,578 --> 01:03:37,897
It does matter. They catch you,
they catch me. It damn well matters!

791
01:03:40,418 --> 01:03:43,017
- I��m a winner
- Hey, man, look at me.

792
01:03:43,177 --> 01:03:45,816
Look at me, man.
I��m not goin�� down for this shit.

793
01:03:48,857 --> 01:03:53,096
And now I know

794
01:03:53,256 --> 01:03:55,175
Why I��ve been sent

795
01:04:31,252 --> 01:04:34,851
Little rump shaker
She can really shake and bake

796
01:04:35,012 --> 01:04:37,051
She��s got skills

797
01:04:39,971 --> 01:04:42,530
- Watch her slipping and a sliding��
- Here, man!

798
01:04:42,651 --> 01:04:44,970
- Makin booty left to right
- Here!

799
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,490
She��s got skills

800
01:04:58,419 --> 01:05:02,018
Hmm. The alarm
must��ve been set.

801
01:05:16,017 --> 01:05:19,696
Addressing the groove
I see you��re drinkin�� again

802
01:05:19,857 --> 01:05:23,776
You��re smokin�� smack inside your
cigarettes and lookin�� pale and thin

803
01:05:23,937 --> 01:05:25,936
Its a shame

804
01:05:26,096 --> 01:05:28,975
Its a pity in New York City

805
01:05:30,376 --> 01:05:32,455
Well

806
01:05:47,494 --> 01:05:50,493
Well, well, well
well, well

807
01:05:50,654 --> 01:05:53,373
Something has changed

808
01:05:53,534 --> 01:05:55,613
The way these people think

809
01:06:04,332 --> 01:06:09,491
Hey there, lonely girl

810
01:06:09,652 --> 01:06:12,731
Lonely girl

811
01:06:12,891 --> 01:06:17,810
Let me make your
broken heart like new

812
01:06:19,341 --> 01:06:21,220
- Oh, shit.
- Hey there, lonely-

813
01:06:34,179 --> 01:06:35,938
White people.

814
01:06:42,738 --> 01:06:44,897
Our dates.

815
01:07:02,816 --> 01:07:05,015
Ohh, shit.

816
01:07:05,176 --> 01:07:07,335
Oh-ho-ho.
Look at this, man!

817
01:07:07,496 --> 01:07:11,775
Mama-say, mama-sa, makusa!
Oh, smack me two times!

818
01:07:11,935 --> 01:07:13,734
Calm down.

819
01:07:13,895 --> 01:07:16,334
My son is going
to the best schools.

820
01:07:16,495 --> 01:07:19,214
My daughter, she aint even
gonna know what a food stamp is.

821
01:07:19,374 --> 01:07:23,293
My wife,
we goin out all the time.

822
01:07:23,454 --> 01:07:25,253
All the time!

823
01:07:28,973 --> 01:07:32,292
- What��s wrong with you, man?
- Nothing.

824
01:07:32,453 --> 01:07:35,012
You sweating that bullshit, ain��t you?
You sweating�� that bullshit.

825
01:07:35,133 --> 01:07:37,692
You did what you had to do
to that guy, man. Don��t worry about it.

826
01:07:37,813 --> 01:07:40,492
All right? Put that shit
behind you, man. Where you goin?

827
01:07:40,652 --> 01:07:44,451
Where you goin?
Where you goin��??

828
01:07:44,612 --> 01:07:46,771
I��m just gonna-
I��m just gonna take a walk.

829
01:07:46,932 --> 01:07:48,691
All right.
Well, hurry back.

830
01:07:48,851 --> 01:07:51,620
I got willpower,
but I don��t know how much.

831
01:07:51,781 --> 01:07:55,140
You know what I��m sayin��??
Yeah.

832
01:07:55,421 --> 01:07:57,420
There is something

833
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:01,179
On your mind

834
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:09,499
By the way
you look at me

835
01:08:13,939 --> 01:08:16,058
There is something

836
01:08:16,219 --> 01:08:20,258
On your mind, honey

837
01:08:23,778 --> 01:08:26,977
Did you ever do something that you
thought would make you feel great?

838
01:08:27,137 --> 01:08:29,176
In a weird way,
you almost feel worse.

839
01:08:29,337 --> 01:08:32,016
Revenge, huh?
Some things hurt no matter what.

840
01:08:32,177 --> 01:08:34,176
That must be a fact
of life.

841
01:08:34,337 --> 01:08:37,776
- And what you��re thinkin��
- Hi!

842
01:08:37,936 --> 01:08:40,655
Hi! Nick.

843
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:43,895
I cant believe it.
What are you doin�� here?

844
01:08:44,056 --> 01:08:47,095
- Danielle.
- Oops.

845
01:08:47,255 --> 01:08:49,614
I don��t know
what I��m doin�� here.

846
01:08:49,775 --> 01:08:52,494
- What are you doin here?
- Well, Sheila, my best friend-

847
01:08:52,655 --> 01:08:56,294
Well, she used to be my best friend. I guess,
technically, Marcy would be my best friend.

848
01:08:56,454 --> 01:08:59,093
I mean, they both think they��re my
best friend, which is okay by me.

849
01:08:59,254 --> 01:09:02,373
But once I did have this nightmare
where Sheila and Marcy are sitting...

850
01:09:02,534 --> 01:09:05,293
right next to each other, and this
Eskimo guy comes over and says, ��Pick. ����

851
01:09:05,453 --> 01:09:09,652
I thought I was gonna die. I mean,
an Eskimo guy. What is that all about?

852
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:12,052
Anyway, Sheila, she��s visiting
and she��s staying here.

853
01:09:12,213 --> 01:09:14,372
And so I thought Id take her
to a party and show her a good time.

854
01:09:14,532 --> 01:09:18,811
And she meets this guy and goes home
with him instead. And, oh, well.

855
01:09:18,972 --> 01:09:21,691
You really look good.

856
01:09:22,822 --> 01:09:24,621
You look-
You look good too.

857
01:09:24,781 --> 01:09:27,940
- Thank you.
- Do you want a drink?

858
01:09:28,101 --> 01:09:30,540
Uh-huh. Yeah. Sure.

859
01:09:32,261 --> 01:09:36,180
You know, I��m such a klutz. I spilled
beer all over my dress earlier.

860
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:40,939
And, well, I think its stained.
Did it stain, Nick?

861
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:54,378
I have Sheila��s room key.
You wanna come up?

862
01:09:54,538 --> 01:09:56,977
- Lets get hot
- Oh, yes, it��s ladies�� night

863
01:09:57,138 --> 01:09:59,297
And the vibes is right

864
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:01,697
Oh, yes, its ladies�� night
Oh, what a night

865
01:10:01,857 --> 01:10:03,816
Oh, what a night

866
01:10:03,977 --> 01:10:07,936
Its ladies�� night
and the feeling��s right

867
01:10:08,097 --> 01:10:10,816
Oh, yes, its ladies�� night
Oh, what a night

868
01:10:10,976 --> 01:10:12,895
Oh, what a night

869
01:10:22,455 --> 01:10:24,774
Nick, Nick,
use your key, man.

870
01:10:27,335 --> 01:10:29,094
All right.
All right, Nick. Damn!

871
01:10:30,934 --> 01:10:34,853
- Hey, Nick, why couldn��t you just use your key?
- Turn your bed down?

872
01:10:49,212 --> 01:10:51,491
Stay.

873
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:12,219
The lady is lookin good

874
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:16,259
- Just like the lady should
- Just like the lady should

875
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:20,179
I��ve been thinking about this
for so long. I want you so bad.

876
01:11:20,339 --> 01:11:22,298
I just wanted to
make her happy.

877
01:11:22,459 --> 01:11:25,058
This is gonna be a night
that you wont forget.

878
01:11:25,219 --> 01:11:27,018
I try to forget,
but I cant.

879
01:11:27,178 --> 01:11:31,337
- Give it to me, Nick.
- Give. That��s all I did was give.

880
01:11:40,697 --> 01:11:44,656
Nick? Nick, you��re really putting
a damper on the mood here.

881
01:11:44,817 --> 01:11:46,816
I��m sorry.
I don��t know.

882
01:11:46,976 --> 01:11:50,015
Danielle, I cant.
I just can��t.

883
01:11:51,656 --> 01:11:54,655
I just wanna make you mine

884
01:11:54,816 --> 01:11:57,775
Well be together
till the end of time

885
01:11:57,935 --> 01:12:01,054
Hey, Kareem. Are you aware
that Charlie and I...

886
01:12:01,215 --> 01:12:04,454
had intended to come up here
and cap your punk ass?

887
01:12:04,614 --> 01:12:06,453
And your girlfriend Nick.

888
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:09,853
But, shit, you two muffins did such an
outstanding job with this financing...

889
01:12:10,014 --> 01:12:13,093
I mean, who could think about killing
at a time like this?

890
01:12:13,254 --> 01:12:16,613
Thanks. Your approval
means a lot.

891
01:12:16,773 --> 01:12:20,812
- Did I tell you to speak? Did I tell you to speak?
- Charlie, no.

892
01:12:20,983 --> 01:12:24,182
That��s gonna be too loud.

893
01:12:24,332 --> 01:12:26,421
Too loud.

894
01:12:55,299 --> 01:12:59,298
- Hello? Hello?
- Hi.

895
01:12:59,459 --> 01:13:02,858
Oh, my God!
Nick, is that you? Are you okay?

896
01:13:04,258 --> 01:13:07,217
- I��m fine.
- Oh, thank God!

897
01:13:07,378 --> 01:13:09,377
I didn��t know if, if you-

898
01:13:09,538 --> 01:13:13,217
I thought that-
You��re not hurt?

899
01:13:13,377 --> 01:13:17,976
- No.
- Oh, thank God! Where are you?

900
01:13:18,137 --> 01:13:23,376
Look, Ann, lets not make this harder
than it has to be. I saw you.

901
01:13:23,536 --> 01:13:27,655
- What?
- I saw you. I know.

902
01:13:27,816 --> 01:13:30,055
Saw me what?
What are you talking about?

903
01:13:30,215 --> 01:13:32,894
Come on. Do you have to do this?
You and Phillip.

904
01:13:33,055 --> 01:13:35,414
- What about him?
- You��re denying it. She��s denying it.

905
01:13:35,575 --> 01:13:40,254
I don��t believe this.
Friday afternoon. Remember?

906
01:13:40,414 --> 01:13:45,093
Well, guess what.
I came home early. I saw you, Ann.

907
01:13:46,574 --> 01:13:50,653
- I was there.
- Oh. Oh, no.

908
01:13:50,823 --> 01:13:53,302
Yeah. Oh, no.

909
01:13:54,783 --> 01:13:58,262
Nick, I was still
at work Friday afternoon.

910
01:13:58,423 --> 01:14:03,462
At work? Well, then your-your clone
was at home screwing my boss.

911
01:14:03,622 --> 01:14:07,301
Nick, it was my sister.
Remember, I told you...

912
01:14:07,462 --> 01:14:10,021
she was coming next Friday
with her fianc��?

913
01:14:10,181 --> 01:14:13,580
Well, I made a mistake. It was this
Friday. They called from the airport.

914
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:15,380
I told them about
the key in the planter.

915
01:14:15,541 --> 01:14:17,420
I called you, but you��d
already left the office.

916
01:14:17,581 --> 01:14:19,940
So I left you a message
on the machine at home.

917
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:23,899
What about
- What about the cuff links? Phillips cuff links were on the sink, Ann.

918
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,539
Honey, they��ve been in the dresser
since the Christmas party.

919
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:30,499
I left them on the counter so you��d
finally remember to bring them to him.

920
01:14:30,659 --> 01:14:33,218
So you��re not having
an affair?

921
01:14:33,339 --> 01:14:36,978
- No, you dick!
- You still love me?

922
01:14:37,138 --> 01:14:39,297
More than anything in the world.

923
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:43,737
You- You wouldn��t believe
what I��ve been through.

924
01:14:43,898 --> 01:14:48,657
You��re gonna laugh,
but I actually- Shit.

925
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:51,616
- What��s the matter? What��s wrong?
- Shit!

926
01:14:51,777 --> 01:14:54,816
- What��s the matter? What?
- Shit!

927
01:14:54,977 --> 01:14:56,816
Shit! Shit!

928
01:14:56,976 --> 01:14:58,935
Shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit...

929
01:14:59,096 --> 01:15:01,415
shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit.

930
01:15:06,295 --> 01:15:08,774
Going down.

931
01:15:17,894 --> 01:15:20,453
- Don��t touch it.
- Oh, man.

932
01:15:20,584 --> 01:15:22,423
Oh, man.

933
01:15:28,863 --> 01:15:32,142
I think I can open the door
and catch the sheet.

934
01:15:32,303 --> 01:15:35,182
- Don��t touch the sheet, please. Don��t-
- No, no, no.

935
01:15:35,342 --> 01:15:38,181
- No, don��t move. Don��t move.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I done moved the hand.

936
01:15:38,342 --> 01:15:41,741
I really don��t think you should be moving right now. I
- I think you��re moving.

937
01:15:41,902 --> 01:15:44,301
- Call the paramedics. Listen to me.
- All right.

938
01:15:44,461 --> 01:15:47,620
Get them here
as fast as you can!

939
01:15:47,781 --> 01:15:49,900
Have them meet me
with a gurney.

940
01:15:50,061 --> 01:15:52,620
- Wait. Let me practice.
- Let you practice?

941
01:15:52,741 --> 01:15:56,300
I��m hangin�� on
a fuckin�� ledge, man.

942
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:59,139
- I don��t wanna die like this, Nick.
- All right.

943
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:01,299
I wasn��t tryin��
to stick you up, man!

944
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:03,539
First, I��m gonna say one. ���� Then I��m gonna
say ����two. ���� Then I��m gonna say ����three. ����

945
01:16:03,699 --> 01:16:06,058
- And then I��m gonna do it.
- I can��t hear you.

946
01:16:06,219 --> 01:16:10,258
- I��m gonna start with one and count to three!
- Okay.

947
01:16:10,419 --> 01:16:12,658
Ready?
One.

948
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,657
- Right.
- Two.

949
01:16:14,818 --> 01:16:17,057
I cant hear you!
You gotta be louder, Nick!

950
01:16:17,218 --> 01:16:20,657
- I said, ��two����!!
- Are you on ����two���� already?

951
01:16:20,818 --> 01:16:23,177
- Ill start again!

952
01:16:24,057 --> 01:16:26,256

01:16:26,417 --> 01:16:29,296

954
01:16:29,457 --> 01:16:32,456
- Nick!

955
01:16:36,176 --> 01:16:39,215
Well, you go, boy!

956
01:16:52,944 --> 01:16:56,503
The elevator!
The money!

957
01:16:58,144 --> 01:17:00,823
Remind me to kick
your ass later.

958
01:17:16,182 --> 01:17:18,221
Oh! Were rich, man!

959
01:17:18,382 --> 01:17:21,741
- We are in the bigs.
- Charlie. Charlie, smell that.

960
01:17:21,901 --> 01:17:23,660
Oh, yes! You, too,
can be a millionaire!

961
01:17:23,821 --> 01:17:25,420
Hookers!

962
01:17:25,581 --> 01:17:27,980
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,
Charlie, smell this.

963
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:30,339
More hookers!

964
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:33,179
- Hookers!
- We hit the mother lode, man!

965
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:35,339
- What the fuck is that?
- What the fuck-

966
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,459
- Okay. What now?
- I don��t know.

967
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:39,498
What do you mean, you don��t know?
I thought you said you had a plan.

968
01:17:39,659 --> 01:17:43,338
- That was my plan: to ram them.
- Ram them.

969
01:17:44,499 --> 01:17:46,058
Speed up!

970
01:17:47,498 --> 01:17:51,097
- Shoot the mother- Shoot him!
- I got him! I got him!

971
01:17:51,258 --> 01:17:53,137
- Shoot em!
- Geez!

972
01:17:54,618 --> 01:17:57,057
You know, I��m tired of this shit.
Let��s go!

973
01:18:03,097 --> 01:18:04,816
Charlie!
Look out, Charlie!

974
01:18:11,496 --> 01:18:15,135
I��m actually grabbing a gun
and going after bad guys.

975
01:18:15,296 --> 01:18:17,695
You the man.

976
01:18:23,705 --> 01:18:25,464
All right.

977
01:18:32,024 --> 01:18:34,023
- You see em?
- No.

978
01:18:34,184 --> 01:18:36,623
Ill, uh-
I��ll let you know.

979
01:18:36,783 --> 01:18:39,782
Please do.
Nick.

980
01:18:45,222 --> 01:18:47,221
What?

981
01:18:49,742 --> 01:18:53,861
- You checkin this shit out?
- Hey, Nick.

982
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:55,860
I like you like this.

983
01:18:56,021 --> 01:18:58,220
You and your prom date
both having weapons.

984
01:18:58,381 --> 01:19:02,060
That way I don��t have to kill
an unarmed couple. It��s not my style.

985
01:19:02,221 --> 01:19:04,380
Put down the bag.

986
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:09,099
- Paul Bunyan, come and take the bag.
- Nick, let me-

987
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:11,459
- You��re an idiot! Shut up! - Shoot this
mother- - No, you��re a fuckin�� idiot!

988
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:16,019
Who are you? Crime dog now? Are you aware that
there��s only two kind of people on the whole planet?

989
01:19:16,179 --> 01:19:18,738
There are killers,
and then there��s everybody else.

990
01:19:18,859 --> 01:19:23,458
I��m a killer, Nick. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
What are you, Nick?

991
01:19:27,778 --> 01:19:30,257
I��m married.

992
01:19:31,218 --> 01:19:35,457
Oh, you son of a-
Wait, wait, wait.

993
01:19:35,617 --> 01:19:38,176
Oh, shit!

994
01:19:38,337 --> 01:19:40,096
What are you,
fuckin out of your mind?

995
01:19:40,257 --> 01:19:42,656
- Fuck!
- What, are you crazy?

996
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:51,495
Huh? Who��s in control now?

997
01:19:51,655 --> 01:19:53,904
Hand over the bag...

998
01:19:54,065 --> 01:19:58,024
or else my man Nick Beam here
gonna put one in your ass.

999
01:19:58,185 --> 01:19:59,984
Aint that right, Nick?

1000
01:20:03,984 --> 01:20:08,543
- Ill roll over.
- Okay, I see it. I see it.

1001
01:20:08,704 --> 01:20:11,383
Let me try to get around
and get you.

1002
01:20:11,543 --> 01:20:13,182
No, its not-

1003
01:20:15,183 --> 01:20:17,822
- No, they��re in the alley. -
Charlie, it��s the police. - Oh, yes!

1004
01:20:17,983 --> 01:20:22,542
- Thank God you��re here. - Thank God you��re
here, man. - Oh, this nightmare��s over.

1005
01:20:22,702 --> 01:20:25,021
- What the fuck are you doin?
- Put the gun down!

1006
01:20:25,182 --> 01:20:27,541
Put that gun down,
you stupid pig!

1007
01:20:27,702 --> 01:20:30,061
- Wait! Come on!
- Come on, man!

1008
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:36,100
Its them.

1009
01:20:36,261 --> 01:20:40,420
Well, some folks in Arizona are
gonna be mighty happy to see you boys.

1010
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:45,419
Wait, wait, wait! Officer! Officer!
Officer, two other guys-

1011
01:20:48,419 --> 01:20:53,058
��I��m married. ���� Ka-blam!
You��re too much.

1012
01:20:53,219 --> 01:20:54,978
- Is the money all there?
- Looks like it.

1013
01:20:55,139 --> 01:20:59,698
Great. We have just enough time
to get it back.

1014
01:20:59,858 --> 01:21:01,857
Excuse me?

1015
01:21:02,018 --> 01:21:05,057
We have to bring the money back.

1016
01:21:05,218 --> 01:21:06,817
No, no.

1017
01:21:06,977 --> 01:21:10,136
Maybe you��re a little bit confused
about the purpose of a robbery.

1018
01:21:10,297 --> 01:21:13,376
Oh, T., I didn��t tell you. When we
were at the hotel, I called my wife.

1019
01:21:13,537 --> 01:21:15,776
Everything��s all right.
You see, it wasn��t her.

1020
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:19,056
She wasn��t even there.
Isn��t that great?

1021
01:21:20,906 --> 01:21:23,385
It was her sister
and her sisters fianc��.

1022
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:27,145
I don��t give a damn if it was
her Uncle Fester and Gumby.

1023
01:21:27,305 --> 01:21:29,864
You aint takin��
this money anywhere, man.

1024
01:21:30,985 --> 01:21:32,984
I don��t wanna
hear all that.

1025
01:21:37,384 --> 01:21:39,423
- Let go. Let go.
- Gimme the bag. You let go.

1026
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:41,223
- Let go of the bag. You let-
- Its not your money.

1027
01:21:41,384 --> 01:21:42,743
- Its not your money.
- It��s not your money!

1028
01:21:42,904 --> 01:21:44,503
- Its not yours. It��s half mine.
- Let go!

1029
01:21:44,664 --> 01:21:46,183
- You let go! - Let
go! - You let go!

1030
01:21:46,343 --> 01:21:48,182
Let go!

1031
01:21:55,982 --> 01:21:58,101
Get back here!

1032
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:19,819
- You okay?
- Yeah, I��m okay.

1033
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:23,139
- And you?
- Ill live.

1034
01:22:25,939 --> 01:22:28,498
Cant let you take
the money, Nick.

1035
01:22:28,619 --> 01:22:31,298
T., my life is in that bag.

1036
01:22:31,459 --> 01:22:36,498
Nick, even if you wanted
to take the money back, you cant.

1037
01:22:36,658 --> 01:22:40,497
- Your face is on the video, man.
- They only review the tapes if something��s missing.

1038
01:22:40,658 --> 01:22:43,937
I can go into work early
and bring it back. No one will know.

1039
01:22:47,937 --> 01:22:49,696
T.

1040
01:22:54,026 --> 01:22:55,945
I can get my life back.

1041
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:15,463
You forget one thing, Nick.
I get my life back too.

1042
01:23:48,141 --> 01:23:50,820
Money don��t make
my world go ��round

1043
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:55,779
I��m reaching out
for the higher ground

1044
01:23:58,019 --> 01:24:01,778
To a warm and peaceful place

1045
01:24:03,099 --> 01:24:06,498
I can rest my weary face

1046
01:24:08,058 --> 01:24:10,217
Life��s answers we try to find

1047
01:24:10,378 --> 01:24:12,937
Oh, we try to find
Yes, we try to find

1048
01:24:13,098 --> 01:24:16,377
Battling inside our minds

1049
01:24:17,937 --> 01:24:22,786
Where do I go from here

1050
01:24:22,937 --> 01:24:27,266
Will all my friends be there

1051
01:24:27,426 --> 01:24:30,305
Cause we��re living
we��re living

1052
01:24:30,466 --> 01:24:32,465
In a crazy maze

1053
01:24:32,626 --> 01:24:35,385
And were fighting
we��re fighting

1054
01:24:35,546 --> 01:24:36,865
To rise above the haze

1055
01:24:37,025 --> 01:24:40,104
Lights at the end
of the tunnel

1056
01:24:40,265 --> 01:24:42,864
Sometimes the journeys long

1057
01:24:43,025 --> 01:24:45,384
There are many theories

1058
01:24:45,544 --> 01:24:48,703
Who��s right and who��s wrong

1059
01:24:50,384 --> 01:24:53,863
Pressures on
I have to choose

1060
01:24:55,583 --> 01:24:58,622
I��ve got nothing to lose

1061
01:25:00,423 --> 01:25:04,222
I close my eyes
I take a chance

1062
01:25:04,383 --> 01:25:08,582
I- I, I now dance
a different dance

1063
01:25:10,622 --> 01:25:12,701
What��s the key
to a happy life

1064
01:25:12,862 --> 01:25:15,301
Tell me now, now, now

1065
01:25:15,461 --> 01:25:18,380
Healthy mind
and lots of spice

1066
01:25:20,581 --> 01:25:23,900
Running barefoot
through the trees

1067
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:27,179
- Oh, my God!
- That��s my idea of free

1068
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:29,899
Ow. Ouch.

1069
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:32,619
What happened to you?

1070
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:35,019
Its a long story.

1071
01:25:35,179 --> 01:25:37,418
- I got shot.
- What?

1072
01:25:37,579 --> 01:25:40,138
And I- I think
I��m wanted in Arizona.

1073
01:25:41,339 --> 01:25:44,338
Plus, my shoes
caught on fire.

1074
01:25:49,148 --> 01:25:52,147
You told me you were selling me the top of
the line. The top of the line is digital.

1075
01:25:52,307 --> 01:25:54,666
Did you sell me a digital?
No, you did not.

1076
01:25:54,827 --> 01:25:56,666
So, I��m bringing it back,
and I expect a full refund.

1077
01:25:56,827 --> 01:25:58,666
And if you do not give me
a full refund, you will not...

1078
01:25:58,827 --> 01:26:00,986
be doing business
with myself or my company.

1079
01:26:01,147 --> 01:26:02,946
Thank you.

1080
01:26:04,866 --> 01:26:08,985
- So, did you hear?
- What?

1081
01:26:09,146 --> 01:26:11,545
Some, uh, vandals
broke in over the weekend.

1082
01:26:11,705 --> 01:26:15,664
- What? - Well, nothing was
stolen. They- They cut the-

1083
01:26:15,825 --> 01:26:17,864
the thingy...

1084
01:26:18,025 --> 01:26:21,384
off Pub��s statue.

1085
01:26:24,144 --> 01:26:27,503
Um, they��re reviewing
the videotape.

1086
01:26:34,543 --> 01:26:37,302
- Hi, everybody. How��s it going?
- Not now, Nick.

1087
01:26:39,702 --> 01:26:42,341
- Did anybody see that game last night?
- Game? What game?

1088
01:26:42,502 --> 01:26:45,381
- Oh, that game. Overtime.
- Will you please shut up!

1089
01:26:47,982 --> 01:26:52,301
Don��t touch it. Don��t touch it.
Oh, you pig. Oh, you pig.

1090
01:26:58,101 --> 01:26:59,980
Well, that��s it.
What��s done is done. Listen.

1091
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:01,979
I��ve got this great idea for
the new McGinty Cracker mascot.

1092
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:04,219
- Move! Move! Move! Move!
Move! Thank you. - This mascot-

1093
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:06,659
- This-
- Nick! Shut up!

1094
01:27:12,139 --> 01:27:14,698
What��s happening?

1095
01:27:16,739 --> 01:27:19,988
Well, what is this?
What the hell is this?

1096
01:27:20,148 --> 01:27:23,947
- I don��t know.
- You goin�� crazy as a spider!

1097
01:27:24,108 --> 01:27:26,347
Somebody must��ve recorded
over the tape.

1098
01:27:26,508 --> 01:27:30,827
- Who had access?
- Uh, there was an electrician in here this morning.

1099
01:27:30,987 --> 01:27:33,386
What electrician?
I did not order an electrician!

1100
01:27:33,547 --> 01:27:37,946
I did. The flickers on the-
Fluorescent lights were flickering.

1101
01:27:38,106 --> 01:27:40,425
- I��m really sorry, sir.
- This is terrible, Phil.

1102
01:27:40,586 --> 01:27:42,105
- I would really like to be alone
now. - Ill go now. - You should go.

1103
01:27:42,266 --> 01:27:44,345
- I would be really like to be alone. - You
should go. - Ill leave now. - You should go too.

1104
01:27:44,506 --> 01:27:47,185
- I would like to be extremely alone for a minute.
- I��m gonna leave you alone.

1105
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:50,104
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Nick.

1106
01:27:55,305 --> 01:27:57,184
All right now. Cut that out.
Y'all wanna eat? You wanna eat?

1107
01:27:57,344 --> 01:27:59,343
- Yeah, we wanna eat.
- I thought you wanna eat. You wanna eat? All right.

1108
01:27:59,504 --> 01:28:01,663
- Just don��t burn the meat.
- I don��t never burn the meat.

1109
01:28:01,824 --> 01:28:04,583
- Uh-huh. What happened the last time?
- Hey, Dad don��t burn the meat.

1110
01:28:04,744 --> 01:28:07,743
- I��m gonna put some more po-po sauce
on it. Y��all like that. - Joey. Tonya.

1111
01:28:07,903 --> 01:28:11,382
- Yeah, that��s-
- Go see your mama, boy. You know.

1112
01:28:11,543 --> 01:28:14,342
Now this is my very
special mustard.

1113
01:28:14,503 --> 01:28:16,742
- Don��t let nobody touch that.
- Okay, Mama.

1114
01:28:16,902 --> 01:28:19,461
- All right.
- Yeah.

1115
01:28:19,622 --> 01:28:22,101
So, how��s the
electrician business?

1116
01:28:23,542 --> 01:28:27,861
Hey. Not bad.
The hours are a bitch.

1117
01:28:28,981 --> 01:28:30,820
I wanna thank you.

1118
01:28:30,981 --> 01:28:35,500
I don��t know why- I just wanna say
I appreciate what you did.

1119
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:40,739
Well, don��t mention it. How��s that?
How did you know where I was anyway?

1120
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:44,419
A friend gave me a tip.

1121
01:28:46,179 --> 01:28:48,538
A friend, huh?

1122
01:28:48,709 --> 01:28:51,468
- You hungry?
- Yes, we would love for you to join us.

1123
01:28:51,629 --> 01:28:53,628
Wouldn��t we, Mama?

1124
01:28:57,388 --> 01:29:00,067
I talked to my boss today
after things settled down.

1125
01:29:00,228 --> 01:29:04,587
Convinced him we need
a new security system. Got any ideas?

1126
01:29:04,747 --> 01:29:07,146
Sure. I can help you
pick one out.

1127
01:29:07,307 --> 01:29:10,506
You wanna run it?
We need someone trustworthy.

1128
01:29:10,667 --> 01:29:13,306
I told him I know
just the guy.

1129
01:29:13,466 --> 01:29:15,145
Well, I��m gonna have to
think about this, Nick.

1130
01:29:15,306 --> 01:29:19,425
Right now, I��m weighing out several
lucrative offers. I mean, they rollin�� in.

1131
01:29:19,586 --> 01:29:21,865
A lot of people want me
to work for them right now.

1132
01:29:22,025 --> 01:29:25,104
Now, that��s just
the way I like it.

1133
01:29:25,265 --> 01:29:28,344
All I need now is some
of Mamas special mustard.

1134
01:29:28,505 --> 01:29:30,304
Stop.

1135
01:29:36,744 --> 01:29:39,303
What��d I do?

1136
01:29:49,862 --> 01:29:53,581
- Run, run!
- Stay down, Nick. Get on outta here.
