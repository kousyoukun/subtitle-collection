00:00:37,647 --> 00:00:39,966
Amira's
brought down just outside the area.

3
00:00:42,172 --> 00:00:43,651
The keeper catches it comfortably.

4
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:47,613
It now looks like there will be
a substitution for the blues.

5
00:00:47,738 --> 00:00:49,418
Gentry replaces Penny.

6
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,900
- Take your time.
- You what?

7
00:00:52,663 --> 00:00:54,063
Big head on that, mate. Thank you.

8
00:00:54,065 --> 00:00:55,262
No problem.

9
00:00:58,188 --> 00:01:01,670
Oh, yeah, two weeks straight
drinking, man. What a great time.

10
00:01:01,672 --> 00:01:03,752
Had a great time.
Felt better when I got home.

11
00:01:03,754 --> 00:01:05,072
Easy.

12
00:01:05,074 --> 00:01:08,716
- What about... What about Ibiza?
- No, we're too old for Ibiza.

13
00:01:08,718 --> 00:01:11,121
What are you talking about? You're
never too old for the island, mate.

14
00:01:11,123 --> 00:01:14,483
That's what people who are too old
for Ibiza say. Where are the crisps?

15
00:01:14,485 --> 00:01:16,045
Oh, I said, "Can I have crisps
for that guy,"

16
00:01:16,047 --> 00:01:18,887
I pointed to you, and he said you're
not allowed to have crisps any more.

17
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:20,049
Said you're only allowed salads.

18
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:21,170
Fucking dickhead.

19
00:01:21,172 --> 00:01:22,890
It's just what he said,
Dom, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:22,892 --> 00:01:24,051
That's harsh, man.

21
00:01:24,053 --> 00:01:27,616
Why don't we go to... Boom, Amsterdam?

22
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:30,859
- No, it's too touristy now, innit?
- All right, TripAdvisor.

23
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:32,941
- I'm not getting off my head again.
- Tuscany?

24
00:01:32,943 --> 00:01:34,743
- Yeah, yeah, no, good wines.
- No.

25
00:01:34,745 --> 00:01:36,986
- Berlin, then?
- Nein.

26
00:01:36,988 --> 00:01:38,507
- Belgium?
- Belgium?

27
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:40,510
Mate, no-one's ever been
to Belgium by choice.

28
00:01:40,512 --> 00:01:44,714
- What's in Belgium?
- Beers that are like 42% or something.

29
00:01:44,716 --> 00:01:47,196
What about hiking? Hiking in Sweden?

30
00:01:47,198 --> 00:01:48,756
- Hiking?
- Yeah.

31
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,600
- Hiking.
- That's a good shout.

32
00:01:51,602 --> 00:01:53,321
Come on, man, let's do something good.

33
00:01:54,686 --> 00:01:56,966
- What's it called again?
- The King's Trail.

34
00:01:56,968 --> 00:01:59,288
It kind of runs up between
Sweden and Norway.

35
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,609
You can go there in the summer.

36
00:02:00,611 --> 00:02:02,971
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's like
the Appalachian Trail, right?

37
00:02:02,973 --> 00:02:05,734
Yeah. Apart from there's more history
than hill billies.

38
00:02:05,736 --> 00:02:08,216
We wanna do something different.
I just don't want go to Amsterdam.

39
00:02:08,218 --> 00:02:10,419
You wanna mix it up.

40
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,381
Yeah, it's not like we're 21 any more.

41
00:02:12,783 --> 00:02:15,104
Oh, look, there's that...
I'm gonna get a bottle.

42
00:02:15,106 --> 00:02:18,026
- Who's on it?
- No way. School night, mate.

43
00:02:18,028 --> 00:02:19,345
I wanna crack on.

44
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:21,429
So no-one...
Anyone wanna come with me?

45
00:02:22,793 --> 00:02:24,513
- Nope.
- Come on, Robert.

46
00:02:24,515 --> 00:02:25,995
- Yeah, go on, then.
- Oh, man.

47
00:02:25,997 --> 00:02:28,397
- Bad idea.
- Anyone want any sweets or anything?

48
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,638
You're not involved in that, are you?

49
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,399
- I'm getting an Uber.
- Yeah, good.

50
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:35,726
Don't you think that it's getting
harder now to have a good time?

51
00:02:35,728 --> 00:02:38,288
Do you know that Phil actually
suggested making this brunch?

52
00:02:38,728 --> 00:02:40,608
Fucking brunch. I'm not, I'm not,

53
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,851
I'm not gonna plan a lads' holiday
over a fucking avocado on toast, mate.

54
00:02:43,853 --> 00:02:46,893
- I'm just... I'm not doing it.
- Avocado's all right.

55
00:02:47,537 --> 00:02:50,176
Do you really wanna go hiking?
Hiking, for fun?

56
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,062
- Yeah.
- In fucking Sweden?

57
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:53,343
Yeah, I do. I dunno,

58
00:02:53,345 --> 00:02:55,905
I just wanna test myself a little,
you know. A challenge.

59
00:02:55,907 --> 00:02:58,668
What would be a challenge is getting
Dom on the side of a mountain.

60
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:00,789
Where's the vodka?

61
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:04,591
Just a shame, you know. It's a shame.
It's a shame what he's become.

62
00:03:04,756 --> 00:03:06,516
Yeah. Yeah, big shame, yeah.

63
00:03:06,518 --> 00:03:09,399
Big successful businessman
with a beautiful wife and children.

64
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:10,839
Yeah, no, it's a...

65
00:03:16,888 --> 00:03:19,168
Don't fucking argue, you cunt!

66
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,530
There's more!
Where the fuck is it, huh?

67
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:23,770
Stop fucking crying!

68
00:03:27,619 --> 00:03:28,976
Don't fucking move.

69
00:03:34,746 --> 00:03:37,265
- Give me your wallet.
- Right, give it to him.

70
00:03:37,548 --> 00:03:39,949
Okay, okay, it's okay.

71
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:41,391
Don't just stand there, do it!

72
00:03:41,393 --> 00:03:42,791
Give me your fucking wallet.

73
00:03:46,315 --> 00:03:48,517
- What else you got?
- What else you got?

74
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,680
Just take his watch.

75
00:03:50,682 --> 00:03:52,883
- Give me the fucking watch.
- All right, no problem, here.

76
00:03:52,885 --> 00:03:55,044
- Do it!
- Okay, all right.

77
00:03:56,327 --> 00:03:57,566
And the ring.

78
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,091
No. It's my wedding ring.

79
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:05,012
- We don't give a fuck!
- Just give me the fucking ring.

80
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:08,298
- Just take it off him!
- No. Look, you've done enough.

81
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,899
It... Just leave.

82
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:11,978
Take it the fuck off him!

83
00:04:13,344 --> 00:04:14,782
Come on.

84
00:04:14,784 --> 00:04:18,185
Listen, you take that ring off
or I will fuck you up!

85
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:26,155
Look, I'm not...

86
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:31,918
Oh, fuck!
Mate, what are you doing?

87
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:33,523
I told you.

88
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:36,084
Fucking hell, mate!

89
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:37,567
What are you doing?

90
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:38,846
It's all right.

91
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:41,971
- For fuck's sake. Leave it.
- Right, let's go, let's go!

92
00:06:08,221 --> 00:06:09,578
Morning.

93
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:11,459
Fuck me, it's cold.

94
00:06:13,185 --> 00:06:14,423
I'll get the coffees on.

95
00:06:20,152 --> 00:06:21,552
- Morning, bud.
- Morning.

96
00:06:21,554 --> 00:06:24,114
How did you sleep?

97
00:06:24,797 --> 00:06:27,155
Like I'd just walked up
a big fucking mountain, man.

98
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,517
One night down, two to go, mate.

99
00:06:44,898 --> 00:06:46,617
Makes you feel insignificant, right?

100
00:06:46,778 --> 00:06:49,617
- Speak for yourself.
- Come on, man, where's your soul?

101
00:06:49,902 --> 00:06:54,224
These mountains were smashed out by
Nordic gods with big bastard hammers.

102
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:56,466
You know what they have
on walking trails in England?

103
00:06:57,548 --> 00:06:59,626
- Pubs.
- Yeah, whatever.

104
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:02,792
Don't tell me you're not impressed.

105
00:07:11,443 --> 00:07:14,165
Yeah, yeah, these are new boots.
Reduced to 200 quid.

106
00:07:14,525 --> 00:07:17,124
- Memory foam as well.
- But you still need to break them in.

107
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:18,767
Yeah, definitely.

108
00:07:19,411 --> 00:07:21,251
It's just basic common sense, Phil.

109
00:07:23,096 --> 00:07:24,774
Okay, I think I've found a spot.

110
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:27,015
Just up the top of that hill.

111
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:05,375
- Fuck me.
- It's beautiful.

112
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,699
Jesus... Christ!

113
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,184
Oh, fuck every hill in the world.

114
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:15,665
Shall we do this?

115
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:27,755
- Bo will be up there waiting for him.
- Man, I hated that dog.

116
00:08:30,202 --> 00:08:31,400
He was a good man.

117
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:34,523
The best of us.

118
00:08:37,128 --> 00:08:38,526
It should never have happened.

119
00:08:45,497 --> 00:08:47,495
It should never have happened
but it did...

120
00:08:50,183 --> 00:08:52,541
And all we can do is remember him.

121
00:09:48,161 --> 00:09:50,399
Robert, we miss you, mate.

122
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,382
We haven't seen her.

123
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:12,104
I can't remember
the last time I saw her.

124
00:10:12,106 --> 00:10:13,745
Yeah, I mean,
she mentioned Gayle.

125
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,547
Yeah, well, they get on.

126
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,693
Rob would have loved this place.

127
00:10:43,737 --> 00:10:45,456
Except we wouldn't be here, though,
would we?

128
00:10:45,618 --> 00:10:50,179
We'd be on some terrible lads' holiday
that he would have hated.

129
00:10:51,265 --> 00:10:54,066
I've said it before, I don't care what
anyone says,

130
00:10:54,068 --> 00:10:55,426
it wasn't your fault, mate.

131
00:11:02,756 --> 00:11:04,955
- Fucking hell, is that the lodge?
- I think it is, yeah.

132
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:07,158
Ah. I thought we were
further out than that.

133
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,358
Uh-uh.

134
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:13,402
When we get back I was thinking
I might stop on a few days.

135
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:16,005
Maybe get out there,
do a little bit more hiking.

136
00:11:16,407 --> 00:11:19,050
- What do you think, man?
- I dunno, mate.

137
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:20,972
Come all this way,
we gotta make the most of it.

138
00:11:20,974 --> 00:11:23,574
No, I think this is enough for me.

139
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:32,265
What are you doing, man?
Here, give it here.

140
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:35,346
You've done it the wrong way round.
Give it here. Unclip the pole.

141
00:11:35,348 --> 00:11:36,827
Christ!

142
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:49,359
Oh, this is awful
in almost every conceivable way.

143
00:11:49,764 --> 00:11:52,844
There are some, Phil,
who consider this character building.

144
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:56,326
Quite frankly, right now,
Sweden can lick my bridge.

145
00:11:56,528 --> 00:11:58,570
- Lick your what?
- My bridge.

146
00:11:58,572 --> 00:12:00,852
- Jesus Christ, the bridge.
- Oh, you mean the perineum.

147
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,814
- Yeah, the gooch. The bridge.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

148
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,536
Argh!

149
00:12:06,378 --> 00:12:07,577
Fuck!

150
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,421
- Come on, let's get you up.
- Argh!

151
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:12,905
Fuck, shit!

152
00:12:12,907 --> 00:12:14,943
All right, come on. Easy, easy.

153
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,591
- Come on, mate, you're all right.
- Up, up, up.

154
00:12:18,593 --> 00:12:19,991
Yeah, all right, easy.

155
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,475
- Oh, fuck.
- Walk about a bit on it.

156
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:25,635
- Argh!
- Give it a walk around.

157
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,397
That's it.

158
00:12:28,843 --> 00:12:30,081
You're okay.

159
00:12:30,564 --> 00:12:33,884
Argh! No, it's twisted. It's twisted.

160
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:37,247
- Can you put your full weight on it?
- Hurts like a son of a bitch.

161
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:40,250
You could probably walk it off,
couldn't you?

162
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:42,853
No, no, it's my meniscus.
I've done it before, it's fucked.

163
00:12:42,855 --> 00:12:46,857
We'll get him something to lean on.
Phil, can you get the rods, please?

164
00:12:49,624 --> 00:12:50,901
What we thinking, Dom?

165
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:54,626
'Cause the trail goes right round
those mountains there,

166
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:57,108
and it's probably, what,
six hours till we camp?

167
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,790
Another eight round to the lodge.

168
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:00,833
What we thinking?

169
00:13:01,435 --> 00:13:02,672
Fuck me.

170
00:13:03,156 --> 00:13:05,876
I'm not doing 14 hours on this.
Okay, man?

171
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,879
Let's get the map.

172
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:10,962
- Wanna try your phone as well?
- No, no need.

173
00:13:11,126 --> 00:13:13,725
- Well, there's no reception anyway.
- Cheers, man.

174
00:13:14,006 --> 00:13:15,605
Luke, my office.

175
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:21,892
What do you think?

176
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:23,734
I think we could be carrying him out

177
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,898
of here like
a fucking Egyptian princess

178
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,620
- if we're not careful.
- Probably not as bad as he says it is.

179
00:13:28,622 --> 00:13:30,541
Almost certainly not as bad
as he says it is,

180
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,863
but it's not gonna stop him moaning
the whole way back, is it?

181
00:13:38,153 --> 00:13:39,592
There is another way out of this, man.

182
00:13:39,594 --> 00:13:40,671
What?

183
00:13:40,673 --> 00:13:43,353
Well, you saw it last night.
The lodge.

184
00:13:43,677 --> 00:13:47,718
It's not that far as the crow flies.
Look, if we go south-west,

185
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,958
through here,
we cut the journey in half.

186
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,323
- What, through the forest?
- Yeah, why not?

187
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,687
Little off-trail hiking.

188
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:57,968
Could be exciting.
Might even do us some good.

189
00:13:58,411 --> 00:14:00,250
We could be kicking back
by the evening time.

190
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,018
I think we need this.

191
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:08,860
Look, why don't me and you
leave them here with the food

192
00:14:08,862 --> 00:14:10,941
and then we can go back,
get some help?

193
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:13,664
No fucking way you're leaving us
on this fucking mountain.

194
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:15,786
I can walk. All right?

195
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,788
If you know a quicker route,
let's do it.

196
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:39,451
- How's the knee, Dom-Dom?
- Killing me. How's your mum?

197
00:14:39,453 --> 00:14:40,971
Unnecessary, innit?

198
00:14:43,497 --> 00:14:46,457
- Are there bears in this forest?
- Course there's fucking bears.

199
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:47,856
Big bastards as well.

200
00:14:47,903 --> 00:14:49,461
Should have gone to Vegas.

201
00:14:49,463 --> 00:14:51,984
You'd have found something
to fall over in Vegas, too.

202
00:14:51,986 --> 00:14:54,264
Yeah, a massive pile of tits.

203
00:14:57,032 --> 00:14:58,470
Shithouse.

204
00:15:00,355 --> 00:15:02,915
Everything in this bastard country
is a relic.

205
00:15:03,197 --> 00:15:04,796
Strange place to park, innit?

206
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:07,439
My next door neighbour's
got one of those.

207
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,960
My eldest is absolutely
obsessed by it.

208
00:15:11,526 --> 00:15:13,966
I got a hand job in one of those once,
at a festival.

209
00:15:14,249 --> 00:15:16,168
Thanks, Phil. What a beautiful story.

210
00:15:16,969 --> 00:15:20,330
- We sure this is a good idea?
- What's up? You scared of the woods?

211
00:15:49,563 --> 00:15:52,603
Now, is it me
or is it really quiet in here?

212
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:55,806
All right, don't shit your pants.
The trees soak up the sound.

213
00:15:55,808 --> 00:15:57,330
That's what trees do.

214
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:58,931
Hiking was easier yesterday.

215
00:15:58,933 --> 00:16:00,652
We weren't
in the forest yesterday.

216
00:16:00,654 --> 00:16:01,934
No, we bloody weren't.

217
00:16:01,936 --> 00:16:03,856
The sooner we get going,
the sooner we get to the town,

218
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:05,856
the sooner we get to the bar,
the sooner we get drunk.

219
00:16:07,502 --> 00:16:10,782
The Swedes were big into logging,
until the 1950s.

220
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:13,067
- Then they decided to pack it in.
- That's interesting.

221
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:17,389
Which is why Sweden is
an untouched land of natural beauty

222
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:19,030
and Britain is a car park.

223
00:16:19,193 --> 00:16:21,713
If you love Sweden so much,
why don't you marry it?

224
00:16:24,838 --> 00:16:26,116
Right, time out.

225
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,762
Dom, what did Gayle say

226
00:16:27,764 --> 00:16:29,642
when you told her you were
going on a hiking holiday?

227
00:16:29,644 --> 00:16:32,003
She said, "Who are you?
What have you done with my husband?"

228
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,570
Oh, here we go, photo op.

229
00:16:38,613 --> 00:16:40,895
- Here we go.
- Scott of the Antarctic.

230
00:16:40,897 --> 00:16:44,295
- Fucking Amelia Earhart over there.
- Wallop.

231
00:16:44,297 --> 00:16:46,737
Yes, that's it.
Let's get a selfie while we're here.

232
00:16:46,902 --> 00:16:49,861
- Selfie? Really?
- You too, Luke, come on.

233
00:16:50,505 --> 00:16:53,664
- Let's preserve this magic moment.
- It's a beautiful thing.

234
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:54,866
Here we go.

235
00:16:54,868 --> 00:16:57,912
Everyone get in.
One, two, three, and Brexit.

236
00:16:57,914 --> 00:16:59,272
Boom.

237
00:16:59,914 --> 00:17:02,313
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah, four twats in a forest.

238
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:04,916
Yeah.

239
00:17:41,155 --> 00:17:43,635
My stomach is beginning to eat itself.

240
00:17:43,677 --> 00:17:45,356
Yeah, I could do a steak.

241
00:17:47,242 --> 00:17:49,721
Big fat, juicy steak.

242
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:53,206
One peppercorn sauce,
one hand-cooked chips.

243
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:56,807
Side salad. Nice tumbler of Scotch.

244
00:17:57,091 --> 00:17:59,652
And a big fat cigar at the end.

245
00:17:59,654 --> 00:18:02,294
Ah, man, I could go for some
sushi right now.

246
00:18:03,378 --> 00:18:06,418
Yeah, some red wine instead of white.

247
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:08,219
Lashings of wasabi.

248
00:18:08,503 --> 00:18:12,944
Big Mac, plastic tray, by myself,
no-one to talk to.

249
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:15,468
- Can I have a kebab, please, mate?
- Donner?

250
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:17,391
No, chicken shish, please.

251
00:18:18,594 --> 00:18:21,073
Rob liked a donner. You remember that?

252
00:18:22,116 --> 00:18:23,354
Yeah.

253
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:25,318
Every Saturday night at uni.

254
00:18:25,601 --> 00:18:28,800
There he was, pissed,
covered in grease.

255
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,208
What the fuck?

256
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:41,653
What the fuck is it?

257
00:18:52,868 --> 00:18:55,827
- Why is it ripped open?
- It's been gutted.

258
00:18:57,351 --> 00:18:59,151
Yeah, but why hang it like that?

259
00:18:59,956 --> 00:19:01,514
I mean, would someone do that?

260
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:04,196
Well, it didn't fucking
put itself there, that's for sure.

261
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:06,476
- Could be hunters out here.
- What, bait?

262
00:19:06,922 --> 00:19:08,160
Possibly.

263
00:19:08,644 --> 00:19:10,963
Or it's the bit they don't show you
in the nature documentaries.

264
00:19:10,965 --> 00:19:12,243
What could do that, though?

265
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:14,008
- A bear.
- Do bears do that?

266
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,047
I don't know, Dominic,
I'm not a fucking bear expert.

267
00:19:20,615 --> 00:19:22,653
- It's still bleeding.
- So?

268
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:26,738
So it means that whatever did that,
we should go. It's a fresh kill.

269
00:19:28,304 --> 00:19:29,823
Yeah, we should go.

270
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:15,707
Fucking Jesus Christ!

271
00:20:17,313 --> 00:20:18,752
Fuck.

272
00:20:19,394 --> 00:20:22,313
- Where the hell are we, Hutch?
- Let me check.

273
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:25,358
This is ridiculous, man.

274
00:20:27,402 --> 00:20:29,641
- We should pitch the tents.
- What?

275
00:20:29,766 --> 00:20:31,366
We should pitch the tents!

276
00:20:31,368 --> 00:20:33,606
So we're giving up
making it back to town tonight, then?

277
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,127
I don't see
we have much choice, Philip.

278
00:20:38,615 --> 00:20:39,813
Guys.

279
00:20:41,456 --> 00:20:43,856
- What is it? What is it?
- Look at this.

280
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:45,616
- Huh?
- Look.

281
00:20:57,153 --> 00:20:59,793
- Well, how about that?
- What is that?

282
00:21:00,557 --> 00:21:01,794
Is that a house?

283
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,959
- Come on.
- Thank Christ.

284
00:21:09,004 --> 00:21:11,563
- Hey, Hutch. Wait a minute!
- Come on!

285
00:21:20,297 --> 00:21:23,535
- Can you see anything?
- It looks empty!

286
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,179
We should leave it alone, then.

287
00:21:26,262 --> 00:21:29,343
- Let's kick it in.
- No fucking way.

288
00:21:29,345 --> 00:21:31,105
We need to get undercover, mate.

289
00:21:31,107 --> 00:21:33,346
- Phil, give us a hand.
- All right, come on, then.

290
00:21:35,151 --> 00:21:37,473
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
We can't just break in.

291
00:21:37,475 --> 00:21:39,395
We can't stay out here all night.

292
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:40,873
On three, yeah?

293
00:21:41,157 --> 00:21:43,077
One, two, three.

294
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:12,865
- Luke, you're getting soaked.
- Did you hear that?

295
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,030
No, I didn't hear anything. Come on.

296
00:22:25,282 --> 00:22:27,442
This is clearly the house
we'll get murdered in.

297
00:22:27,444 --> 00:22:30,002
It's not as bad as
our uni accommodation.

298
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:36,289
That's the shape on the tree, I think.

299
00:22:39,656 --> 00:22:42,136
Guys, this place is definitely
abandoned, yeah?

300
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:44,178
Abandoned? Who'd have moved in?

301
00:22:45,261 --> 00:22:48,140
Whoever it was,
they were packing. Look at that.

302
00:22:49,546 --> 00:22:52,546
- I don't like this place.
- Not too keen on it myself, mate,

303
00:22:52,548 --> 00:22:55,547
but it's a lesser-of-two-evils
kind of situation.

304
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:59,313
Hutch. I definitely
just heard something outside.

305
00:22:59,315 --> 00:23:00,916
Well, maybe you did, Lukey.

306
00:23:00,918 --> 00:23:02,477
We're not the only animals
in the woods.

307
00:23:04,402 --> 00:23:06,679
Right, let's see
if we can get this stove working.

308
00:23:06,681 --> 00:23:08,240
We'll need stuff to burn.

309
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,926
- Like what?
- Anything made of wood'll do.

310
00:23:17,372 --> 00:23:19,450
We're gonna smash the place up,
are we?

311
00:23:20,296 --> 00:23:23,255
- And what if the homeowners come back?
- Fuck 'em.

312
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,820
Anyone who lives here
has more to worry

313
00:23:24,822 --> 00:23:26,540
about than their table being on fire.

314
00:23:27,343 --> 00:23:29,022
Might be some stuff to burn up there.

315
00:23:29,705 --> 00:23:31,103
Go on, Phil, you're nearest.

316
00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:33,588
- What?
- Go on.

317
00:23:34,431 --> 00:23:36,749
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No.

318
00:24:06,062 --> 00:24:09,985
Wa-hey, that's it, lad!

319
00:24:11,749 --> 00:24:12,947
Dickheads.

320
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:56,668
Guys, get the fuck up here right now!

321
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,110
What now?

322
00:25:07,044 --> 00:25:08,282
Oh, shit.

323
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:13,287
Oh, my God.

324
00:25:16,493 --> 00:25:17,770
What the fuck is that?

325
00:25:24,581 --> 00:25:26,579
- That's witchcraft.
- Huh?

326
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,504
That's what that is,
that's witchcraft.

327
00:25:29,426 --> 00:25:31,105
Is that meant to be a person?

328
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:33,747
What, with no head
and antlers for hands?

329
00:25:34,832 --> 00:25:36,551
If I hear anything
coming down the stairs...

330
00:25:36,553 --> 00:25:38,792
Don't. Fucking hell!

331
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:44,960
I'm going downstairs
to get that fire started.

332
00:25:45,323 --> 00:25:46,921
You guys can stay up here if you want.

333
00:25:48,525 --> 00:25:50,723
- Yep. Good idea.
- Come on.

334
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:12,668
Looked like that fucking thing
in the tree.

335
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:16,150
Could be idolising
a spirit or a deity.

336
00:26:16,314 --> 00:26:19,633
Some kind of pagan or Nordic shit.

337
00:26:20,158 --> 00:26:21,396
Like an offering or something.

338
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:24,717
Yeah, well, I almost offered up
a massive shit when I saw it.

339
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,840
- I thought they worshipped Odin.
- Well, that is Nordic.

340
00:26:28,366 --> 00:26:32,607
Who knows what they're into out here?
Living here, in the middle of nowhere.

341
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:35,050
Sun goes down,
don't come up for six months.

342
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:37,210
You're bound to go fucking mental
in the winter.

343
00:26:38,215 --> 00:26:40,213
We should probably burn this place
down when we leave.

344
00:26:40,737 --> 00:26:43,377
Fucking well up for burning it down.

345
00:26:44,222 --> 00:26:45,981
Listen, though, I think that, um,

346
00:26:47,262 --> 00:26:48,620
when we wake up tomorrow,

347
00:26:48,945 --> 00:26:51,224
we should think about just going
back out the way we came.

348
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,790
We don't need to wilfully add
another day to the trip, do we?

349
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:58,473
- Let's just stick to the shortcut...
- My old scoutmaster used to say

350
00:26:58,475 --> 00:27:01,557
"If the shortcut was a shortcut,
it would be called a route."

351
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:04,240
Why pretend you were in the Scouts?
You were never in the Scouts.

352
00:27:04,242 --> 00:27:05,800
Where did I get the quote from, then?

353
00:27:05,802 --> 00:27:08,563
Guys, right, we have a map,
we have a compass,

354
00:27:08,565 --> 00:27:09,883
we have supplies.

355
00:27:10,249 --> 00:27:13,368
So as long as we don't panic,
as long as we don't fuck ourselves

356
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,530
- we're gonna be absolutely okay.
- No-one's fucking anyone.

357
00:27:15,532 --> 00:27:19,414
- Who knows? It could be a long night.
- No-one's fucking anybody.

358
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:23,376
We're in sleeping bags,
for crying out loud.

359
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,298
It could get messy.

360
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:31,187
I'll give any of you a grand to go
upstairs and sleep with that thing.

361
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,068
Absolutely no way.

362
00:27:33,353 --> 00:27:35,591
- My wife would never forgive me.
- No, she wouldn't.

363
00:27:35,672 --> 00:27:37,873
- Good night.
- Yeah, all right, okay.

364
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:40,675
Couple of hours, soon as it's light,
we'll get out.

365
00:28:59,076 --> 00:29:00,595
Hutch.

366
00:30:15,512 --> 00:30:19,311
Hutch?

367
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:21,237
Hutch?

368
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:22,400
Mate, wake up.

369
00:30:22,402 --> 00:30:25,042
Mate. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

370
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:27,363
- Where the fuck am I?
- We're in that house.

371
00:30:27,365 --> 00:30:28,924
We're in that fucking house, okay?

372
00:30:28,926 --> 00:30:30,924
Get up, okay? Get up.

373
00:30:32,451 --> 00:30:34,930
Where's the... Where's my fucking...

374
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,139
Jesus Christ.

375
00:30:43,263 --> 00:30:44,902
I've pissed myself.

376
00:30:45,024 --> 00:30:47,224
Gayle.

377
00:30:47,226 --> 00:30:48,664
Dom?

378
00:30:49,387 --> 00:30:51,066
Gayle!

379
00:30:51,709 --> 00:30:53,148
Dom.

380
00:30:53,313 --> 00:30:54,670
Dom!

381
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:58,514
- Gayle!
- Wake up. Mate, mate, it's okay.

382
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,716
Get up, mate.

383
00:31:03,842 --> 00:31:05,160
Wake up.

384
00:31:05,603 --> 00:31:06,683
Where's Phil?

385
00:31:06,685 --> 00:31:09,244
Where the fuck's...

386
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,177
Oh, fuck.

387
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:23,497
Phil.

388
00:31:26,306 --> 00:31:27,544
Fuck!

389
00:31:29,428 --> 00:31:32,549
Phil. Phil, what are you doing?

390
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,912
Phil, what are you doing?

391
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:39,355
It's okay.

392
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:41,998
It's okay. Mate, get up, okay?

393
00:31:44,324 --> 00:31:46,083
What's this? What's this?

394
00:31:46,203 --> 00:31:47,802
I don't know. I don't know, mate.

395
00:31:51,971 --> 00:31:53,249
Get up, okay?

396
00:32:12,271 --> 00:32:15,751
Just grab everything.
Just shove it in the bags, let's go.

397
00:32:23,601 --> 00:32:24,999
Can we fucking hurry up, yeah?

398
00:32:26,006 --> 00:32:27,283
I want to get out of here now!

399
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,541
Oh, for fuck's sake.

400
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:49,304
- We shouldn't be here.
- It's a warning.

401
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,588
No, we don't know that.
We do not know that.

402
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,628
- It's a warning.
- Fuck!

403
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:00,955
Listen.

404
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:04,403
Hutch, we just go out
the way we came in, okay?

405
00:33:04,405 --> 00:33:07,045
- We go north-east.
- It's a knee-jerk plan.

406
00:33:07,047 --> 00:33:08,526
- Guys.
- It's a bad plan.

407
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,967
- Mate.
- Hey!

408
00:33:09,969 --> 00:33:11,206
Hey!

409
00:33:11,609 --> 00:33:12,769
Is that a path?

410
00:33:12,771 --> 00:33:15,412
No, Dom, south-west is this way, mate.

411
00:33:15,414 --> 00:33:17,013
South-west can go and fuck itself.

412
00:33:17,015 --> 00:33:19,377
You said we were
getting out of this forest yesterday.

413
00:33:19,379 --> 00:33:21,458
The storm slowed us down.
What do you want?

414
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,299
So did the dead thing hanging
in the trees

415
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,142
and the spooky fucking house!

416
00:33:26,025 --> 00:33:27,703
Um, can we go?

417
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:29,423
We don't even know where that goes.

418
00:33:29,587 --> 00:33:31,788
We could end up in Norway
for all we know.

419
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:36,593
Great! You know, I'm sick of this
off-road bollocks. Okay?

420
00:33:37,116 --> 00:33:39,394
A path means civilisation.

421
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:43,679
Dom.

422
00:33:46,687 --> 00:33:47,925
Marvellous.

423
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:22,718
So are we gonna talk about it, then,
or not?

424
00:34:23,843 --> 00:34:25,363
Because I'd really like
to talk about it.

425
00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:28,164
- I'd rather not, mate.
- You'd rather not?

426
00:34:28,286 --> 00:34:30,808
I woke up stark bollock naked
in front of that thing,

427
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,251
praying to it, and I'd love someone
to explain it to me.

428
00:34:33,253 --> 00:34:36,295
It was a nightmare, Phil.
What's commonly known as a nightmare.

429
00:34:36,297 --> 00:34:40,778
- What happened to you, then, mate?
- We all did. We all had nightmares.

430
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:43,982
We got spooked and we had bad dreams.

431
00:34:43,984 --> 00:34:46,583
- All right?
- Yeah. Leave it out, mate.

432
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:50,228
Hang on, mate. You were screaming
and shouting at the top of your voice.

433
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,627
You were shouting "Gayle!"

434
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:54,471
- Have you ever done that before?
- I said leave it out, Luke.

435
00:34:54,994 --> 00:34:57,714
- Something made me do that.
- Press on.

436
00:34:57,716 --> 00:35:00,998
Bad dreams or not, I'd never have done
that. Something was in that house.

437
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,601
For fuck's sake, Phil!
Listen to yourself, mate.

438
00:35:04,484 --> 00:35:06,043
I'm a bit fucking humiliated

439
00:35:06,045 --> 00:35:08,364
about being found in my kegs
covered in piss.

440
00:35:08,447 --> 00:35:10,809
All right?
I don't really wanna psychoanalyse it.

441
00:35:10,811 --> 00:35:13,730
I don't wanna play fucking
make-believe because, right now,

442
00:35:13,813 --> 00:35:16,134
we have some real fucking problems.

443
00:35:16,136 --> 00:35:19,458
Like finding out which way
this fucking path ends up.

444
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,020
Enough of the bullshit
ghost stories, okay?

445
00:35:22,143 --> 00:35:23,822
You're starting to sound like
my daughters.

446
00:35:27,066 --> 00:35:28,665
Outside I'd never
have done that, mate.

447
00:35:31,592 --> 00:35:33,150
Something's not right here.

448
00:35:44,803 --> 00:35:46,365
- Did you say south-west, yeah?
- Yes.

449
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:48,686
- Which way is south-west?
- That ridge up there.

450
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:53,328
- What, towards the light?
- Yeah. We're just tracking along it.

451
00:35:55,094 --> 00:35:57,774
Five more minutes on this path
and I'm pulling rank.

452
00:36:01,302 --> 00:36:04,062
You see these things? Man-made.

453
00:36:04,823 --> 00:36:06,221
We're getting somewhere.

454
00:36:20,882 --> 00:36:24,681
- Should we have a look?
- Absolutely not.

455
00:36:25,406 --> 00:36:27,124
- Let's keep going.
- Yep.

456
00:36:27,406 --> 00:36:29,286
We can still get out of here today.

457
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:33,611
Dom...

458
00:36:35,856 --> 00:36:37,736
Dom, maybe we should think about this.

459
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:39,857
Dom.

460
00:37:02,522 --> 00:37:05,043
Guys, I just need a minute.

461
00:37:07,408 --> 00:37:08,646
My knee's killing me.

462
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:12,447
These are the wrong fucking shoes.

463
00:37:15,296 --> 00:37:20,097
Er, Dom, you might have to push
through the pain barrier a bit, mate.

464
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,941
- We can't keep going at this pace.
- Screw you.

465
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:27,226
I'm through the pain barrier.
I'm in bloody agony.

466
00:37:27,228 --> 00:37:30,106
No. I think you're uncomfortable.
There's a difference.

467
00:37:30,189 --> 00:37:32,792
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't realise you were a doctor.

468
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:35,955
Go give yourself a fucking prostate
exam and leave me in peace, yeah?

469
00:37:35,957 --> 00:37:38,236
Dom, come on, get up.

470
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,837
No.

471
00:37:41,282 --> 00:37:43,442
Dom, I want out of these woods now.

472
00:37:43,444 --> 00:37:45,162
Please get up.

473
00:37:45,646 --> 00:37:48,127
This is fucking ridiculous.

474
00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:52,209
I'm gonna go to the top of that ridge,
see if I can see anything.

475
00:37:52,332 --> 00:37:54,371
Yeah. Yeah, good idea, man.

476
00:37:54,734 --> 00:37:56,812
- To the ridge, straight back.
- Got it.

477
00:37:56,897 --> 00:37:58,656
- Don't go too far.
- Yeah, got it!

478
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,159
Fuck!

479
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:49,247
Guys!

480
00:39:50,052 --> 00:39:51,851
- Everything okay?
- There's something up there.

481
00:39:51,853 --> 00:39:53,011
What are you talking about?

482
00:39:53,013 --> 00:39:55,574
- There's something in those woods.
- What do you mean?

483
00:39:55,576 --> 00:39:58,297
- Something fucking big.
- Like an animal? What?

484
00:39:58,299 --> 00:39:59,980
Can we not do this, please?

485
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:03,021
Can we all agree to not start
losing our fucking shit in here?

486
00:40:03,023 --> 00:40:05,224
- There is fucking something up there.
- Shut up.

487
00:40:05,226 --> 00:40:07,427
Okay, listen, I'm not trying
to fucking freak you out

488
00:40:07,429 --> 00:40:10,308
but I woke up last night
and there was some fucking...

489
00:40:10,392 --> 00:40:11,911
And look at this.

490
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:15,513
- What...
- What the fuck is that?

491
00:40:17,237 --> 00:40:19,477
Nothing has done that to you. You...

492
00:40:20,922 --> 00:40:22,640
You're on your own.
You've done it to yourself.

493
00:40:22,642 --> 00:40:25,606
- I fucking what?
- You walked into a fucking tree.

494
00:40:25,608 --> 00:40:27,646
Why do you have to fucking deny
everything I say?

495
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,647
Because I do not value
your judgement, Luke.

496
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:33,813
And I wanna get the fuck out of here.

497
00:40:33,815 --> 00:40:35,775
Listen, mate, we wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you!

498
00:40:35,777 --> 00:40:38,498
No, we wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you!

499
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,937
Dom, shut up.

500
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:48,146
Come on, what do you mean by that?

501
00:40:52,393 --> 00:40:53,671
Track it back.

502
00:40:55,757 --> 00:40:58,639
- You know what I'm talking about.
- No. No, I don't.

503
00:40:58,641 --> 00:41:01,120
I don't, no. Why don't you just, er...

504
00:41:01,923 --> 00:41:05,162
- Fucking come out and say it?
- Come on, guys. This is bullshit!

505
00:41:05,406 --> 00:41:07,525
- Come on, mate.
- Now there it is!

506
00:41:07,808 --> 00:41:10,328
Now he's got some fucking
fight in him, yeah?

507
00:41:11,371 --> 00:41:13,131
Well, where was that with Rob?

508
00:41:14,376 --> 00:41:16,416
You fight your friends,
you can't stand up for them.

509
00:41:16,418 --> 00:41:19,178
You are not my
fucking friend any more.

510
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,259
No, I am not.

511
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:22,783
- No, you're fucking not.
- Oh, for fuck's sake, guys.

512
00:41:22,785 --> 00:41:24,623
No, you are fucking not. Okay?

513
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:26,465
Do you know what?
I am fucking done with you.

514
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,149
Not a drop of blood on you.

515
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:33,470
Fucking coward.

516
00:41:35,436 --> 00:41:37,798
- What?
- Dom, will you shut the fuck up.

517
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,599
No, hang on, Hutch, mate.
Hang on. Hang on. What?

518
00:41:41,683 --> 00:41:43,001
Fucking what?

519
00:41:43,205 --> 00:41:45,403
He has his skull cracked in half

520
00:41:45,687 --> 00:41:47,368
and you come out of there

521
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,209
without a drop of blood on you. Argh!

522
00:41:49,211 --> 00:41:52,292
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Dom, are you all right, mate?

523
00:41:52,294 --> 00:41:54,854
- He's broken my nose!
- Shut up.

524
00:41:54,856 --> 00:41:58,415
You've not broken your nose,
all right? Don't start your shit now.

525
00:41:58,618 --> 00:42:01,058
You keep quiet if you want,
but somebody's got to say something.

526
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,593
This is exactly the kind of situation

527
00:42:13,595 --> 00:42:16,158
where people fall out
and we need to be...

528
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,439
Where you going?
We need to be working together, man!

529
00:42:21,962 --> 00:42:24,040
Luke. Fucking hell. Luke.

530
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:26,205
Luke.

531
00:42:26,528 --> 00:42:29,969
Is that what you think? Eh?
That it was my fault?

532
00:42:31,372 --> 00:42:32,770
That I should have stood up?

533
00:42:35,658 --> 00:42:37,095
I don't know.

534
00:43:22,505 --> 00:43:23,862
Looks like someone was here.

535
00:43:25,589 --> 00:43:26,906
Are we stopping?

536
00:43:29,592 --> 00:43:30,870
What the fuck is that?

537
00:43:33,675 --> 00:43:37,235
Yeah, what is that, man?
Some sort of fabric, I think.

538
00:43:45,286 --> 00:43:47,966
I think
it's a tent or something.

539
00:44:12,553 --> 00:44:13,831
It's a credit card.

540
00:44:14,236 --> 00:44:16,516
Anna Eriksen. Expires 1984.

541
00:44:17,278 --> 00:44:18,876
That's a bad sign, isn't it?

542
00:44:19,401 --> 00:44:22,640
Just leaving your tent behind
and your shoes?

543
00:44:25,286 --> 00:44:28,847
Guys. Guys, seriously, come on.

544
00:44:28,891 --> 00:44:31,049
We're not gonna be these people,
right? Okay?

545
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:34,134
Because we registered at the lodge.

546
00:44:34,136 --> 00:44:37,297
And in five hours' time,
five hours' time,

547
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:39,018
they are gonna report us missing.

548
00:44:39,221 --> 00:44:42,701
We're on a path in the woods.
It's near a hiking trail.

549
00:44:43,385 --> 00:44:45,504
This is where people get found, right?

550
00:44:47,871 --> 00:44:49,188
It's getting dark again.

551
00:45:35,918 --> 00:45:37,397
Oh, thanks.

552
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,077
Thank you. Thank you.

553
00:45:40,403 --> 00:45:41,681
How are you doing?

554
00:45:42,526 --> 00:45:44,085
I'm looking forward
to the rescue party.

555
00:45:53,257 --> 00:45:55,136
Dom's knee is getting worse,
not better.

556
00:45:57,259 --> 00:45:58,697
Phil's not looking great.

557
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:10,350
You're the strongest.
You should try and get out, get help.

558
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:12,191
I'll stay with these two.

559
00:46:14,157 --> 00:46:17,356
- You think so?
- Definitely.

560
00:46:20,362 --> 00:46:21,841
I'll get you fixed up in the morning.

561
00:46:22,285 --> 00:46:24,845
- Take the compass, head south-west.
- Okay.

562
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:26,688
- Keep south-west.
- Okay.

563
00:46:28,771 --> 00:46:30,651
- Good man, mate.
- Yeah.

564
00:46:33,456 --> 00:46:34,694
How are we doing here, mate?

565
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,856
Let's have a look at this.

566
00:46:37,018 --> 00:46:39,300
Ooh, looks nasty, that, man.

567
00:46:41,143 --> 00:46:42,382
Yeah, it's not good.

568
00:46:42,384 --> 00:46:45,184
- Have you put anything on it?
- No, I haven't got anything.

569
00:46:45,827 --> 00:46:48,587
Maybe Dom's got
something in his backpack.

570
00:46:48,589 --> 00:46:49,711
Fucking shoes.

571
00:46:49,713 --> 00:46:50,951
That looks grim.

572
00:48:59,842 --> 00:49:01,080
Phil, Phil!

573
00:49:01,967 --> 00:49:03,925
- Phil, Phil, Phil!
- It was here.

574
00:49:10,654 --> 00:49:12,573
- Where's Hutch?
- I don't know, man.

575
00:49:12,734 --> 00:49:14,777
- Where's Hutch?
- All I saw was shadows.

576
00:49:14,779 --> 00:49:16,377
- What?
- I don't know!

577
00:49:16,379 --> 00:49:18,340
It just... It took him.

578
00:49:18,502 --> 00:49:19,622
Hutch?

579
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:21,342
Hutch!

580
00:49:22,905 --> 00:49:25,106
- Get up, Hutch has gone.
- What?

581
00:49:25,108 --> 00:49:26,347
Hutch has gone!

582
00:49:34,998 --> 00:49:36,959
Oh, fuck.

583
00:49:40,363 --> 00:49:42,603
- What we gonna do?
- I don't know.

584
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:45,848
Hutch?

585
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:48,928
Hutch!

586
00:49:50,574 --> 00:49:52,253
- Hutch!
- Luke...

587
00:49:53,138 --> 00:49:54,376
Hutch!

588
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,383
Luke, we're getting turned around
out here.

589
00:50:00,385 --> 00:50:04,184
- Hutch!
- We should try and retrace our steps.

590
00:50:04,749 --> 00:50:06,348
Everything we have
is in the tents, Luke.

591
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:07,869
- He's fucking screaming.
- I know.

592
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:11,472
But if we run around in circles,
we're gonna get fucking lost. Okay?

593
00:50:11,474 --> 00:50:14,235
We need to get back to the camp
and get our bearings. Yeah?

594
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:17,717
Fuck... Fuck.

595
00:50:21,165 --> 00:50:22,924
We'll find the tents
and come back for him.

596
00:51:44,689 --> 00:51:45,967
Is that...

597
00:51:48,013 --> 00:51:49,291
Is that Hutch?

598
00:52:00,905 --> 00:52:02,423
Oh, my God!

599
00:52:17,121 --> 00:52:18,319
Oh, fuck.

600
00:52:20,525 --> 00:52:21,763
Come on!

601
00:52:21,765 --> 00:52:23,324
- Did he have the map?
- No.

602
00:52:23,888 --> 00:52:25,848
- What are we gonna tell Catherine?
- I don't know.

603
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:29,212
- What about his kids?
- Listen, okay? Just calm down.

604
00:52:29,214 --> 00:52:31,934
We need to get out of here, now.
We need to move.

605
00:52:31,936 --> 00:52:33,294
We can't leave him here.

606
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:36,136
We can't bury him. Okay?

607
00:52:36,461 --> 00:52:38,501
We'll send people to come and get him.

608
00:52:38,503 --> 00:52:40,580
Fucking hell,
we don't know where we are.

609
00:52:41,225 --> 00:52:43,544
- It put him there, didn't it?
- What?

610
00:52:44,069 --> 00:52:45,308
It knew we were gonna come this way

611
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:46,909
and we were supposed to find him,
weren't we?

612
00:52:46,911 --> 00:52:48,671
Oh, for fuck's sakes.

613
00:52:48,793 --> 00:52:53,515
You don't fucking do this.
You keep your, your shit together.

614
00:52:53,517 --> 00:52:55,397
Shush. He's right.

615
00:52:55,399 --> 00:52:56,677
I'm not...

616
00:52:57,401 --> 00:52:58,799
I'm not leaving him like this.

617
00:53:26,751 --> 00:53:28,590
- We should say something.
- We need to go.

618
00:53:30,395 --> 00:53:31,753
It's gonna come back.

619
00:53:34,919 --> 00:53:36,277
Dom, come on.

620
00:53:37,442 --> 00:53:38,759
Come on.

621
00:53:49,614 --> 00:53:51,293
It was at that house.

622
00:53:53,739 --> 00:53:56,179
We had those nightmares
and it followed us, didn't it?

623
00:53:56,782 --> 00:53:58,020
Yeah.

624
00:53:59,222 --> 00:54:01,662
It followed us from that house
and it did that to Hutch.

625
00:54:03,429 --> 00:54:05,067
Did you actually see it yesterday?

626
00:54:05,671 --> 00:54:06,788
I don't know what I saw.

627
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:09,311
Well... I did see it,

628
00:54:10,754 --> 00:54:13,076
while I was up on that ridge,
and the trees were the same as this.

629
00:54:13,078 --> 00:54:14,756
Oh, Jesus Christ.

630
00:54:15,082 --> 00:54:16,999
It was big, okay?

631
00:54:17,001 --> 00:54:19,082
It had to be to put that fucking elk
in the tree.

632
00:54:19,084 --> 00:54:21,966
It was hunters, pagan fucking
hill billies from those houses.

633
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:23,928
No-one's lived in those houses
for years.

634
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:26,449
- Fucking hell!
- Keep your voice down.

635
00:54:26,451 --> 00:54:28,130
- There are houses in this forest.
- Keep it down.

636
00:54:28,132 --> 00:54:30,733
There are people
and they killed our fucking friend!

637
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:31,934
Shut the fuck up. Shut up!

638
00:54:33,337 --> 00:54:34,936
Keep your fucking voice down.

639
00:54:36,861 --> 00:54:39,860
There are three of us
and there is one of it.

640
00:54:40,745 --> 00:54:42,264
And I've got a fucking knife.

641
00:54:42,908 --> 00:54:45,789
So we are gonna keep walking
in the direction that Hutch said

642
00:54:45,791 --> 00:54:48,591
until we get out of this fucking
forest. Do you hear me?

643
00:55:47,293 --> 00:55:49,933
Oh, my God.

644
00:56:37,262 --> 00:56:40,742
You see? There's people.

645
00:56:42,629 --> 00:56:44,948
- Are we following these?
- Course not.

646
00:56:46,551 --> 00:56:47,909
We shouldn't go that way.

647
00:56:49,234 --> 00:56:51,473
Okay. Okay.

648
00:56:55,842 --> 00:56:57,199
South-west is up.

649
00:57:00,245 --> 00:57:01,443
I'm tired, man.

650
00:57:40,085 --> 00:57:41,564
Ah!

651
00:57:52,258 --> 00:57:53,536
It's okay.

652
00:57:58,465 --> 00:57:59,823
Come on, mate, get up.

653
00:58:01,346 --> 00:58:02,783
Got inside my head, man.

654
00:58:03,989 --> 00:58:06,148
Made me pray to that thing
in the house.

655
00:58:08,513 --> 00:58:10,232
I can't get it out of my fucking head.

656
00:58:12,278 --> 00:58:13,675
Come on, mate, get up.

657
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,118
We're far away from that now.

658
00:58:17,682 --> 00:58:18,923
Come on, you can do it.

659
00:58:39,704 --> 00:58:41,383
Dom, look. Look.

660
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:45,027
Phil.

661
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,237
Where are you going?

662
00:59:12,259 --> 00:59:13,536
We're close.

663
00:59:15,461 --> 00:59:17,701
Guys! I can see the end!

664
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:20,583
I can see the end.

665
00:59:26,393 --> 00:59:28,551
I shall... I shall try...

666
00:59:50,697 --> 00:59:52,014
Guys?

667
00:59:53,301 --> 00:59:54,579
Guys, you gotta see this.

668
00:59:55,421 --> 00:59:56,619
Dom?

669
00:59:58,386 --> 00:59:59,624
Phil.

670
01:00:00,468 --> 01:00:03,749
- What you doing?
- We heard something.

671
01:00:03,751 --> 01:00:05,029
Phil.

672
01:00:50,556 --> 01:00:52,274
You can't run.

673
01:01:29,675 --> 01:01:30,953
Dom...

674
01:01:32,278 --> 01:01:33,516
Dom!

675
01:01:34,921 --> 01:01:36,199
Phil?

676
01:02:03,549 --> 01:02:04,787
What the...

677
01:02:07,513 --> 01:02:10,433
You're alive, you're alive.
Where's Phil?

678
01:02:12,678 --> 01:02:16,318
I just heard something coming
and it, it just took him.

679
01:02:18,565 --> 01:02:20,525
What did you see?
What did it look like?

680
01:02:20,527 --> 01:02:23,127
I don't know. It's fast.

681
01:02:26,053 --> 01:02:27,493
It's fucking hunting us.

682
01:02:27,495 --> 01:02:30,095
Jesus Christ. I thought I'd die.

683
01:02:30,698 --> 01:02:33,459
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die alone.

684
01:02:33,461 --> 01:02:36,100
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.

685
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:40,186
I am not going to leave you. Okay?

686
01:02:40,188 --> 01:02:42,467
Okay?

687
01:02:48,995 --> 01:02:51,196
- Do you think it's gonna come back?
- Yes.

688
01:02:51,198 --> 01:02:52,516
Yeah.

689
01:02:53,241 --> 01:02:54,879
But I think I might
have found a way out.

690
01:03:00,367 --> 01:03:01,886
Do you think you can move your leg?

691
01:03:03,531 --> 01:03:05,290
Yeah, a little.

692
01:03:05,292 --> 01:03:07,732
Okay, okay.

693
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:11,776
Piggy back?

694
01:03:15,302 --> 01:03:17,021
- I'm afraid we're gonna have to run.
- Yeah.

695
01:03:17,023 --> 01:03:19,021
- I know.
- Are you ready?

696
01:03:19,628 --> 01:03:21,867
In a minute. In a minute.

697
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:32,516
Let's go on "three."

698
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,838
Okay?

699
01:03:36,443 --> 01:03:37,641
One...

700
01:03:40,809 --> 01:03:42,046
Two...

701
01:03:44,051 --> 01:03:45,328
Three.

702
01:03:47,654 --> 01:03:48,852
Come on.

703
01:04:23,929 --> 01:04:25,207
His eyes!

704
01:04:28,416 --> 01:04:29,694
Argh!

705
01:04:32,819 --> 01:04:34,018
There's a path.

706
01:04:37,986 --> 01:04:39,264
Oh, fuck.

707
01:04:39,827 --> 01:04:41,628
Oh, my God. No, no, no, no, no!

708
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:43,028
- Phil!
- No, we gotta go!

709
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:44,549
Phil!

710
01:04:55,283 --> 01:04:56,600
Hello?

711
01:04:58,487 --> 01:04:59,804
Please!

712
01:05:03,932 --> 01:05:06,811
Come on. Get up, get up, get up.

713
01:05:53,262 --> 01:05:54,821
- Luke.
- Mmm?

714
01:05:59,267 --> 01:06:00,584
Wake up.

715
01:06:02,511 --> 01:06:05,071
What the fuck?

716
01:06:13,642 --> 01:06:17,122
- What is that?
- I don't know. I don't fucking know.

717
01:06:31,459 --> 01:06:32,938
Okay, okay.

718
01:06:33,901 --> 01:06:35,138
What can you see?

719
01:06:35,944 --> 01:06:37,182
I see people.

720
01:06:39,027 --> 01:06:41,828
- Two, three... Four.
- What are they doing?

721
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:44,828
It looks like they're building.

722
01:06:44,872 --> 01:06:46,712
Putting something together.
Building something.

723
01:06:46,916 --> 01:06:48,395
What the hell do they want?

724
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:52,237
Those fuckers.

725
01:06:55,804 --> 01:06:57,122
I've gotta get out of here.

726
01:07:01,971 --> 01:07:03,329
Can you reach the table?

727
01:07:04,772 --> 01:07:06,252
- Why?
- Break the glass.

728
01:07:06,254 --> 01:07:07,572
Cut the ropes.

729
01:07:15,864 --> 01:07:17,623
Go on. Go on, Luke.

730
01:07:17,987 --> 01:07:19,185
Yes.

731
01:07:19,467 --> 01:07:20,705
Go on, Luke.

732
01:07:29,397 --> 01:07:30,635
Fuck.

733
01:08:03,511 --> 01:08:05,351
Is that water? Water?

734
01:08:25,814 --> 01:08:27,173
What are you doing?

735
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:41,147
What?

736
01:08:54,123 --> 01:08:55,361
Come on.

737
01:08:55,765 --> 01:08:59,724
No, give him some. No, give him some.

738
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:07,134
- No!
- What are you doing?

739
01:09:07,297 --> 01:09:10,255
Oh! Luke! Help!

740
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:12,938
Dom!

741
01:09:20,028 --> 01:09:21,588
Dom!

742
01:09:25,235 --> 01:09:26,472
Dom!

743
01:09:29,236 --> 01:09:30,515
Dom!

744
01:09:37,766 --> 01:09:39,085
Argh!

745
01:09:39,568 --> 01:09:41,327
- Oh, please don't!
- Dom!

746
01:09:41,650 --> 01:09:44,529
Oh, God, no!

747
01:10:10,119 --> 01:10:16,280
They prepare for sacrifice. Over soon.

748
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:57,203
You okay?

749
01:11:02,493 --> 01:11:03,770
Dom?

750
01:11:08,739 --> 01:11:09,976
Are you okay, mate?

751
01:11:13,903 --> 01:11:17,264
I never told you about my nightmare.

752
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:23,990
I saw these people,
offering me to that thing.

753
01:11:25,675 --> 01:11:26,913
Dead hands.

754
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,357
Gripping me.

755
01:11:36,206 --> 01:11:39,047
And I saw... Gayle.

756
01:11:41,811 --> 01:11:43,089
I saw my wife.

757
01:11:48,659 --> 01:11:50,017
I'm gonna die here, Luke.

758
01:11:50,461 --> 01:11:54,942
No. No. No, you're not.
I couldn't lose all of you.

759
01:11:55,145 --> 01:11:57,025
They're gonna kill me.
Do you understand?

760
01:11:57,106 --> 01:11:58,266
They are not.

761
01:11:58,268 --> 01:12:00,906
They're not gonna kill you because
I'm not gonna let them kill you, okay?

762
01:12:01,349 --> 01:12:02,628
Listen to me.

763
01:12:03,834 --> 01:12:05,313
You're gonna get out of here

764
01:12:06,236 --> 01:12:12,118
and you're gonna burn this fucking
place to the ground behind you.

765
01:12:14,123 --> 01:12:15,401
Do you understand?

766
01:12:17,088 --> 01:12:20,046
You don't stop. You keep going.

767
01:12:21,129 --> 01:12:22,327
You live.

768
01:12:25,535 --> 01:12:27,175
And you tell my wife...

769
01:12:29,498 --> 01:12:31,217
I tried to get back to her.

770
01:12:31,421 --> 01:12:34,661
I'm not gonna do that,
cos I don't need to do that. Okay?

771
01:12:34,864 --> 01:12:36,102
Luke.

772
01:12:37,025 --> 01:12:39,664
I don't need to do that.
I don't need to do that.

773
01:12:42,072 --> 01:12:44,271
Okay? Okay?

774
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:53,220
Come on. Come on.

775
01:14:02,672 --> 01:14:04,391
What the hell is this?

776
01:14:20,491 --> 01:14:24,812
You fucking stupid pricks.

777
01:14:27,937 --> 01:14:29,497
Why don't we do this, yeah?

778
01:14:30,502 --> 01:14:32,302
What are you waiting for?

779
01:14:42,391 --> 01:14:43,749
Come on.

780
01:14:46,796 --> 01:14:48,034
Come on.

781
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,000
What are you waiting for!

782
01:15:07,619 --> 01:15:08,816
Come on.

783
01:15:09,821 --> 01:15:11,100
Fucking come on.

784
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:56,623
Gayle?

785
01:15:59,712 --> 01:16:00,948
Gayle!

786
01:16:01,952 --> 01:16:03,189
Dom?

787
01:16:07,397 --> 01:16:09,077
Gayle!

788
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,599
Gayle?

789
01:16:23,093 --> 01:16:25,371
- Dom.
- Gayle?

790
01:17:52,143 --> 01:17:53,822
Did you take him down from the tree?

791
01:17:55,625 --> 01:17:57,064
We don't move the bodies.

792
01:17:58,148 --> 01:17:59,386
What is it?

793
01:18:00,151 --> 01:18:01,469
A god.

794
01:18:02,114 --> 01:18:03,432
Ancient.

795
01:18:04,196 --> 01:18:05,474
One of the Jotunn.

796
01:18:09,441 --> 01:18:11,680
A bastard offspring of Loki.

797
01:18:12,484 --> 01:18:13,842
We do not say its name.

798
01:18:14,285 --> 01:18:15,723
Because you're afraid of it?

799
01:18:17,047 --> 01:18:18,406
We worship it.

800
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:20,128
It keeps us here.

801
01:18:21,252 --> 01:18:23,132
Let us live beyond natural life.

802
01:18:24,175 --> 01:18:27,455
No more pain. No more death.

803
01:18:30,903 --> 01:18:32,462
Your ritual begins tonight.

804
01:18:33,666 --> 01:18:35,465
It is a privilege to worship.

805
01:18:37,068 --> 01:18:38,828
You will kneel before the god.

806
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:43,071
If not, it will hang you
from the trees.

807
01:18:47,357 --> 01:18:48,636
Why me?

808
01:18:51,522 --> 01:18:52,961
Your pain is great.

809
01:18:53,044 --> 01:18:56,645
Yeah, I'm not like you,
and I will not live like this.

810
01:18:58,851 --> 01:19:00,250
You will kneel before it,

811
01:19:00,252 --> 01:19:01,690
like the rest of us.

812
01:23:05,817 --> 01:23:07,015
Yes.

813
01:23:44,218 --> 01:23:45,497
Fuck off. Fuck off.

814
01:23:49,423 --> 01:23:51,501
Shit.

815
01:23:51,503 --> 01:23:53,622
Fuck.

816
01:24:16,609 --> 01:24:17,928
Drop the axe.

817
01:24:19,452 --> 01:24:20,690
Stay there.

818
01:24:21,214 --> 01:24:23,774
Stay there. Stay there. Stay there.

819
01:27:13,348 --> 01:27:14,666
No. No.

820
01:30:06,643 --> 01:30:11,643
