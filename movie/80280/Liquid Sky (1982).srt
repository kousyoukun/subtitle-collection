1
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,080
Hey, I need some stuff.

2
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,590
You got any money babe ?

3
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,250
No but I'll get some tomorrow.

4
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,090
But I don't wanna think about tomorrow,
you had for me tonight remember ?

5
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,990
-Hey listen...
-No.

6
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,700
Let's go to your place.

7
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,500
Right now, with you ?

8
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,240
Sure.

9
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,510
Ok, let's go.

10
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,010
You know where she keeps
the stuff ?

11
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,010
Don't ever ask me about that.

12
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,550
I don't usually fuck girls.

13
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,780
That's Ok I prefer girls
to men anyway.

14
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,380
You think we can find it ?

15
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,150
Find what ?

16
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,590
We could take just a little.

17
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,760
She wouldn't know.

18
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,890
Adrian would know.

19
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,260
Besides...

20
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,000
I don't know where it is.

21
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,600
Yes, you do...

22
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,000
Fuck you!

23
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,890
Cut it out!

24
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,890
That's enough I think
you should leave.

25
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,490
If you want to go to the club and
ask Dave, you'll go ask her.

26
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,610
Are you gonna take a cab?

27
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,680
Fuck yourself.

28
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,580
Margaret ?

29
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,390
You have to get back to the club.

30
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,890
Adrian will have finished singing and we'll
still have to make up for the fashion show.

31
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,960
Open the door.

32
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,400
I wanna get me backed and dressed.

33
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,200
OK.

34
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,900
Margaret ?

35
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,810
Accompany me to the club.

36
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,190
So it's all set Margaret
we'll come over tomorrow night.

37
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,790
Janet was supposed to be in here.

38
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,360
Your roof is great.

39
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,860
And you're even better.

40
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,000
Jimmy ! Looking forward to seeing
you tomorrow night.

41
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,900
I don't know.

42
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,210
Come on, we'll have a great time
and get some terrific shots.

43
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,110
There's a chance to get them
published in Midnight Magazine.

44
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,080
What kind of drugs we have ?

45
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,680
The thing you want.

46
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,280
Allright.

47
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,610
Liquid sky...

48
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:25,180
Key to heaven...
Paradise

49
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,980
That's what they used to call.

50
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,990
But I don't want you
to do it anymore.

51
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:33,990
It's dangerous.

52
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,290
So...see you tomorrow
at Margaret's roof.

53
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:42,300
And don't stay out all night
I want you looking fresh for the shoot.

54
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,200
You want to look bad ?

55
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,400
I said yes.

56
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,210
People have been using
opiates for centuries.

57
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,310
Ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome,
India, China

58
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,580
Everybody used them nobody thought it
was destructive or dangerous

59
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,780
They didn't think it was
immoral to feel euphoric.

60
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,290
Are you gonna come to my roof
tomorrow night ?

61
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,990
I'll decide that tomorrow night.

62
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,990
All right listen to me everyboby.

63
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,690
Listen up !

64
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,800
Get it restless,
let's start the show.

65
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,410
In this country at the turn
of the century,

66
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,710
you could buy a heroin derivative
in any drugstore

67
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:04,050
to cure your ill's housewives.

68
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,680
They loved these and used for
everything like aspirin.

69
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,790
Everybody wants euphoria.

70
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,490
What's wrong with that ?

71
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,990
I'm not a housewife at the turn
of the century and

72
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,700
I do not want heroin in
my house.

73
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,780
It's not just for pleasure...
I use it to open my blocked creativity,

74
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,480
Cocteau wrote great litterature
while high on opium.

75
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,590
Cocteau was Cocteau before
he ever did drugs.

76
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,390
What's that supposed to mean ?

77
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,200
That it's not gonna help you.

78
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,400
You bitch.

79
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,510
Help me out won't you ?

80
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,610
You always have to throw your
success in my face.

81
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:43,580
If you wanna help me...
hold this for me.

82
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,080
Hold this.

83
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,390
Please !

84
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,200
Paul...I did it because I love you.

85
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,310
You want some stuff ?

86
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,510
What do you think ?

87
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,380
You have my money yet ?

88
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,580
No but we'll get some,
I could pay you tomorrow.

89
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,790
No money no stuff babe.

90
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,590
I'll have it tomorrow.

91
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,690
Talk to me tomorrow.

92
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,290
You'll give me the stuff or
I'll rat on you.

93
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,290
He smashed up the place
looking for it.

94
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,300
He's not going to get
any stuff tomorrow either.

95
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,700
I'm not nice.

96
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,070
Hey, Marv and you should
snort some scagg.

97
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,310
Actually, I'd rather have cocaine.

98
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,510
I hate you, ugly chick.

99
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,610
There's some guy on the dance
floor offering cocaine to all the chicks.

100
00:15:49,651 --> 00:15:51,380
Why don't you ask him ?

101
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,000
Hi you...

102
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,200
Nice chick, want snort some blow ?

103
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Sure.

104
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,910
Well, I don't wanna do it here.

105
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,210
Will go to my place it's not far.

106
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,400
Where's the cocaine ?

107
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,900
Did you ever do Quaaludes before ?

108
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,600
I've done more Quaaludes than
you have aspirin.

109
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,870
They don't excite me.

110
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,110
These are "lemons"...you can't get
them all the time.

111
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,210
Listen if I wanna dance I can
shoot heroin any time I want.

112
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,880
Where's the cocaine ?

113
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,880
Why don't you just take these ?

114
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,350
Now !

115
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,990
Because I don't want them.

116
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,490
What are you gonna do ?
Throw them down my throat or something ?

117
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,400
You're a model right ?

118
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,600
Right.

119
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,800
Where's the cocaine ?

120
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,210
I do soaps...

121
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,810
Do you have
ever seen me ?

122
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,310
I don't watch soaps.

123
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,780
My father works for MGM.

124
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,450
He gets me jobs.

125
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,080
My father...

126
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,990
...could help you.

127
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,890
What do you say, your daddy
his gonna

128
00:18:13,931 --> 00:18:16,090
help me break into show business ?

129
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,990
That's the corniest line
I've ever heard.

130
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:36,110
My father will get you a job
as an actress.

131
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:38,380
You're pretty enough ?

132
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,350
He'll do it if I ask him.

133
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,090
You should be nice
to me.

134
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,250
You just want to get laid.

135
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,390
You'll say anything to get laid.
Like every one else from California.

136
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,230
What do you have a cock
for a brain baby ?

137
00:18:50,271 --> 00:18:52,360
Don't fuck with me you asshole.

138
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,700
Why don't you go fuck your
father, he loves you so much.

139
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,300
Swallow it !

140
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,210
Swallow it ! Swallow !

141
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,610
Come on swallow.
Swallow it !

142
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,160
What's that supposed to do ?

143
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,290
Make me fall apart and
spread my legs.

144
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,500
Takes more than two Quaaludes
to do that baby.

145
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,700
Why don't you go home
to your mama ?

146
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,410
You fucking horse.

147
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,160
Swallow it !

148
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,790
Swallow, just swallow that.
Swallow it !

149
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,500
Son of a bitch.

150
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,000
Bitch.

151
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,310
Want more ?

152
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,300
Would you give me
my flask ?

153
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,100
You wanna drink ?

154
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,870
Yeah, please.

155
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,300
-Want a drink ?
-Yeah

156
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,800
All right.

157
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,210
All right.

158
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,190
Is that better ?

159
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,300
I want my vision to be blurred
so I don't have to look at your face.

160
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Shit !

161
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,780
What I want you to do,

162
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:19,790
turn around...go over there
and stay put.

163
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,000
Who are you?

164
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,000
I live here.

165
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,100
Are you her girlfriend?

166
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,700
What difference does it make?

167
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,910
Just curious.

168
00:24:36,951 --> 00:24:38,310
You like girls better
than boys?

169
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,980
I'm always curious about
who love to make those sexual definitions.

170
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,580
What do you mean?

171
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,680
Homosexual, heterosexual,
bisexual.

172
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:52,590
Whether or not I like someone doesn't
depend on what kind of genitals they have.

173
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,690
As long as I find them attractive,
don't you think?

174
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:01,000
See I don't want to fuck a man,

175
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Okay, it's your business.

176
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,380
So you like both man and women.

177
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,180
What difference does it make to you?
You're a junkie.

178
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,590
Can't get it up anyway.

179
00:25:24,631 --> 00:25:26,090
How do you know?

180
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,390
Live her alone.

181
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,990
Live me alone.

182
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,000
Don't worry it's a good count.

183
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,810
I don't have any works can I use
yours and do it now.

184
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,410
I don't wanna watch him.

185
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,080
I wasn't talking to you.

186
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,480
Your girlfriend,
she's very pretty.

187
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,590
She's a bitch.

188
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,590
Margaret...

189
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,190
...is an uptight Wasp cunt
from Connecticut.

190
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,600
Can I use your works?

191
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,400
Yeah, It's allright.

192
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,000
But give me an extra four hours.

193
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,300
Sure.

194
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,610
Do me a favor...

195
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:21,210
Can't get around to get off.

196
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,680
Relax baby.

197
00:26:25,721 --> 00:26:28,180
-Takes a lot.
-You should be happy.

198
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,090
Paul give us some money we can
go take a lunch. So what?

199
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,890
Get ready to go.

200
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:37,090
It gets this bitch two hours
to get ready to go out somewhere.

201
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,300
In the beginning aliens were
spotted in places with large amounts of heroin.

202
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,900
Later, aliens appeared in specific
sub cultures, punk cultures.

203
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,270
Still around heroin and in these
punk cultures

204
00:29:01,311 --> 00:29:03,370
many more strange deaths have occured.

205
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,510
Big fucking belly, eat your food!

206
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,980
Apple pie, shit!

207
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:17,090
Why don't you ask something to eat
some cheese some...and taste some wine...

208
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,890
Nothing strange about deaths
in punk culture.

209
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,300
They kill each other by shooting
too much dope.

210
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:34,300
I remember when we were...
in Cambridge there was war

211
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,910
I think between the Mods and Rockers.

212
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,110
They went on each other
with bicycle chains.

213
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,980
I don't think your punks need help
from the outside to kill themselves.

214
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:49,790
My mother used to bake five or six
apple pies at once.

215
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,390
Apple pie...

216
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:57,390
She put them in the porch to cool.

217
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,600
We had an apple tree in
the backyard.

218
00:30:00,641 --> 00:30:04,800
When coming from play
and the porch would be filled with steam.

219
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,300
We couldn't have any pie
until after dinner.

220
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,810
You were lucky baby she
sounds like a real angel.

221
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,010
Listen I happen to have
a free evening tonight.

222
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:18,180
I'd love you to come at my place
I've done some changes.

223
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,180
I'd love to know what
you're doing.

224
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,480
I'd love you for dinner.

225
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:29,090
Well I have an appointment with a
fashion photographer, I can't get out of it.

226
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,590
Well I'm glad your carrer
is going so well.

227
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:37,000
The most interesting fact we found

228
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,400
these killings occur during
sexual intercourse.

229
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,570
You don't know my mom
was great, listen to this:

230
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,710
One time she came out
of the house for a ride.

231
00:30:45,751 --> 00:30:47,810
And she was OK she was cool
she was great.

232
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:51,380
So she went out with this guy,
this really straight guy,

233
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,480
they went to this really
fancy restaurant.

234
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,780
You know, best in town! Right?

235
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,390
She was doing fine.

236
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,590
And all of a sudden, man,

237
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,490
she stood up on the balcony.

238
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,590
She could be right up
on the balcony man, and

239
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:08,500
she pulled up her skirt and she looked at
all the people and she said:

240
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,300
I'm Jesus Christ, man. And I baptize you
in the name of the son the father and the holly ghost

241
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,310
and she pissed on every body.

242
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,910
It must have gone in the fucking food
and everything.

243
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,610
Can you beat that?

244
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,210
Shit...

245
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,220
Then what happened?

246
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,220
Then they threw her back in.

247
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,220
Thank you.

248
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,430
Get check, please.

249
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Remember the last time you
were off at the studio?

250
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,910
When was that?

251
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,810
-Six months ago.
-Right.

252
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:00,080
Remember there were a lot
of people there?

253
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,590
Well, several people came up
to me and said:

254
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,790
Is that your brother?

255
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,290
Of course you're my sister mom.

256
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,300
I show you the documentation
about progress.

257
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,810
You mean you made slides
of sexual intercourse?

258
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:30,280
They're gorgeous you know.

259
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,580
Hey mom, can I have some money?

260
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:41,190
I have to be right, I'll send you
a check allright?

261
00:32:41,231 --> 00:32:42,190
Allright.

262
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,000
You take American Express?

263
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,200
I really need it you know.

264
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,600
Can I give you when
I left uptown?

265
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,410
No! I'm going down.

266
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:05,180
It's not funny, we've not only
located the UFO,

267
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,280
but we've managed to photograph
the creature inside of the craft.

268
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:13,990
We did an attempt to classify
his various emotions and states.

269
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,400
May be I'll go to Berlin.

270
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,500
They'll love me in Germany baby,
I'll be a star.

271
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,000
I'll buy cocaine.

272
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:32,510
Saw a fax with beautiful names.

273
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,010
C'mon will be great.

274
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,680
You think it will be different there?

275
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,890
Why would you have to fuck up your hair.
Your hair look like shit.

276
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,690
That's what Owen always says.

277
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:54,100
Owen...I was supposed to meet Owen.
I forgot.

278
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,500
Where?

279
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,700
Taking Owen to our place?

280
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,400
Well, I didn't want
to go there.

281
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,010
I don't like Owen baby,
I don't want to see Owen.

282
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,810
What's your schedule like?
I need your help.

283
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,110
I cannot get to close because
I'm a stranger in this country.

284
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:15,380
There are some things which are
difficult to study because of that.

285
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,990
I watched the creature from
the empire state building

286
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,090
but at night it's closed.

287
00:34:20,131 --> 00:34:23,490
How can I study the behaviour
of this creature?

288
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,890
It's on a private property.

289
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,400
I don't know...I'd like to help you,

290
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,700
but I don't know
what you expect me to do.

291
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,300
I'm just a college
acting teacher.

292
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,010
Fuck see Owen, OK.

293
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:44,480
I got business, I got things to do.

294
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,280
See fucking Owen.

295
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:52,090
Well, listen...I'd like to help you
in some way but...

296
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:54,990
I've an appointment right now,

297
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:57,290
can we get in touch tomorrow?

298
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:00,800
These aliens are killing people,
you're the only person I know in New-York.

299
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,000
Telephone me tomorrow,
keep in touch OK?

300
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,800
Almost everything you've done
since you left me

301
00:35:37,841 --> 00:35:42,200
has been self destructive.
Adrian is a real bad influence on you.

302
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,510
She didn't care anything about you.

303
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,380
She's only using you.

304
00:35:50,421 --> 00:35:54,480
You're ruining your carrer.
Your future.

305
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,780
What are you talking about?

306
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,290
It's the only thing I care,
about my carrer.

307
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,090
What do you thing I'm doing right now?

308
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:04,990
I'm getting ready to shoot with
a fashion photographer I met at the club.

309
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,400
Who's got to come here.

310
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,500
He only wants to go to bed with you.

311
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Nobody, nobody fucks at the club,
everybody's gay.

312
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,610
It's you who thinks about fucking
all the time.

313
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:21,910
Your vocabulary is punctuated
to two words "Shit" and "Fuck".

314
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,280
What do you say I should say making
love instead of fucking?

315
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:42,900
So what do you think?
Is that better professor?

316
00:36:42,941 --> 00:36:45,700
I think you look like a hooker.

317
00:36:45,741 --> 00:36:48,300
And you act like a hooker.

318
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:53,510
You'll end up in a hospital with
some horrible sexual disease.

319
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:57,380
You don't understand, so I look
like a hooker?

320
00:36:57,421 --> 00:36:58,880
So what?

321
00:36:58,921 --> 00:37:02,790
You like it...I know that you like it.

322
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:05,490
So why should I live these lies?

323
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:10,790
The way you want me to dress and behave
is as a sweet housewife

324
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:14,000
slave of her husband's will.

325
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:19,000
A hooker at least is independant
...nobody's victim.

326
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,610
It's the only fair that I warn them,
this pussy has teeth.

327
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,380
You're my best student.

328
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,790
I invested a lot of time in you.

329
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,990
What do you say? We've spent
most possible time in bed.

330
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,600
You know, Adrian has turned you
into a real mean bitch.

331
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,810
Every body says so.
Try to be nice.

332
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,880
What do you think?
Do you like this professor?

333
00:38:03,921 --> 00:38:06,880
I think you look better in jeans
that in a turtleneck.

334
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:08,780
Yes, professor.

335
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,390
May I help you?

336
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,700
Yes...what side of the building
do your windows face?

337
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,700
Are you the fire inspector?

338
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,200
No, I'm a scientist.

339
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,500
Well, I put my fire extinguisher in
and all my exit rows are accesible.

340
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,210
I'm a scientist.

341
00:38:30,251 --> 00:38:32,510
And you're studying windows.

342
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:36,010
Well, windows have something to do
with my research

343
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:38,880
you see I'm an astrophysicist
and I'm researching

344
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,680
some phenomenon which has
occured in some countries.

345
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,680
I'm from West Berlin.

346
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:46,290
Let me show you my...identification.

347
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,800
Have you had dinner?

348
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,710
No.

349
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,310
Well I have a free evening tonight.

350
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:11,580
Why don't we go upstairs and discuss
a bite while we eat?

351
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:19,090
All your costumes...

352
00:39:19,131 --> 00:39:23,090
they're just a participation
in somekind of a phony theater.

353
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,400
I only tell you this for
your own good.

354
00:39:30,441 --> 00:39:34,400
It's a freak show.

355
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,210
Are you trying to say that your blue
jeans weren't theater?

356
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,210
It's not the same thing.

357
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:47,280
So your professor wore a three
piece suit and blamed you for your jeans.

358
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,280
And your jeans were too much.

359
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:53,290
Don't you understand that your
suit was also a costume?

360
00:39:55,890 --> 00:40:00,400
Is that your jeans did for love
and sexual quality weird
is no way wearing a costume.

361
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,600
So you want me now, right?

362
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:50,680
You have the best legs.

363
00:40:50,721 --> 00:40:53,980
We both have good legs.

364
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:58,790
We had children they would
have the best legs to stand.

365
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,790
I thought I looked ugly and
would give you diseases.

366
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,600
It's a perfect place for watching.

367
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,900
I'm ordering some chinese
is that OK?

368
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,310
It's perfect.

369
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,210
You are wet.

370
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:26,480
You have no right to do that
I'm not your possession.

371
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,790
It's so simple isn't it?

372
00:41:37,831 --> 00:41:40,400
Well you can have me.

373
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,800
I don't wanna have you.

374
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,410
I wanna make love to you.

375
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,980
I'm telling this for your own good...

376
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,190
I think you should go home.

377
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:09,690
You've spent all your energy
trying to get me excited

378
00:42:09,731 --> 00:42:12,800
and then...
Want to throw me out?

379
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Please leave...

380
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,810
Come here.

381
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,390
Ok I'd like two orders of shrimp
fried rice.

382
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,590
An order of shrimp and pea pods.

383
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,690
An order of shrimp with
lobster sauce.

384
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:46,200
And an order of jumbo shrimp.

385
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,200
Owen...get up.

386
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:33,680
-What I'm working on.
-That's what I'm working on.

387
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:36,680
Are you...a researcher?

388
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:40,780
No I'm a TV producer,
do you think that they exist?

389
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,710
So you're looking for heroin
and you don't want the police to
know about it.

390
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:07,110
Listen, this really has nothing to do
with drug traffic.

391
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:11,780
What can I do? Nobody really knows
the true nature of these aliens.

392
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,580
You're from Germany?

393
00:44:14,621 --> 00:44:15,980
Yes, Berlin.

394
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,490
I'm jewish...

395
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:22,390
So what connections
do you think

396
00:44:22,431 --> 00:44:26,800
there can possibly be between
UFO's and...heroin?

397
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:39,910
What the fuck is going on
in here?

398
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,380
Have you ever seen a UFO ?

399
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,990
Yes, this morning, that's why
I'm here.

400
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,090
Well that's very interesting.

401
00:44:52,131 --> 00:44:53,890
Would you like a drink?

402
00:44:53,931 --> 00:44:55,490
You can see it as well.

403
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:56,990
I can see a UFO?

404
00:44:57,031 --> 00:44:59,290
Yes, through your window.

405
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,500
You mean I can go over, there
to my window,

406
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:05,300
and I can look at it
I can see a UFO?

407
00:45:05,341 --> 00:45:08,400
No, but you can see it through
my telescope.

408
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,210
Oh, you have a telescope with you?

409
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,610
Yes, in my case.

410
00:45:13,651 --> 00:45:15,910
So why don't you set it up?

411
00:45:15,951 --> 00:45:18,080
I always dreamed about
seeing a UFO.

412
00:45:18,121 --> 00:45:20,580
Hey, what did you say
you were drinking?

413
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:46,110
So you're dead now...shit.

414
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,810
And you're going to hell.

415
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:51,480
Straight from your
marihuana jungles.

416
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,680
Straight from your lies,
your lies, your lies.

417
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:58,690
You dropped it, fuck!

418
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,090
Suits you well.

419
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:03,290
You go to hell.

420
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:07,600
Whe'll all go to hell.
I'll go to hell too.

421
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,600
But I know I'm damned.

422
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,700
And you, never knew.

423
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,000
So you weren't ready?

424
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,310
to toll the bell.

425
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:20,910
For me it's easy.

426
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:24,380
From hell to hell I'm not dancing
in marihuana jungles.

427
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,180
I live in concrete mazes,
stone and glass.

428
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,890
Hard like my heart,
sharp and clean.

429
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:34,690
No romantic illusions
to changing the world.

430
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:37,890
I don't lie to myself.

431
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:41,200
That love can cure because
I know I'm alone.

432
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,000
And you fucked that every day.

433
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,410
You lived, you lied,
you lied you lied.

434
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,780
You go to hell?
Suits you well.

435
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,180
Shit!

436
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,280
Ok, you wanna see an alien craft?

437
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,490
You will see it. Look.

438
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:13,400
You know I always dreamt
to fuck a dead man, that's my chance.

439
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,700
You're crazy.

440
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,300
Sure I'm baby.

441
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
That's why you like me,
so let's fuck him.

442
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,600
-Don't you touch him.
-You want any?

443
00:47:22,641 --> 00:47:24,410
So you fucked twice today already.

444
00:47:24,451 --> 00:47:25,810
Don't do it!

445
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:32,980
You don't like it baby,
you don't have to watch.

446
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,390
Crazy!

447
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,470
Don't do it.

448
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,810
Don't get moral with me, whore,
you had to fuck him didn't you?

449
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,110
I told you not to fuck him.

450
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,980
This is my place I do what
I want here.

451
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,980
You can fuck any petty asshole
who gives you a chance.

452
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,080
You god damn whore!

453
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:13,690
Don't you call me that
you low-class freaking monster!

454
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:15,490
Monster!

455
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:18,490
I'm a monster? You let these guys
walk on your bones, bitch!

456
00:48:18,531 --> 00:48:21,700
and you're gonna kill me
with syphylis one day, you dirty cunt.

457
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,800
Don't talk to me like that.

458
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,100
Your mother was nuts,
your father was a bum.

459
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,610
You'll never go anywhere but to the Bowery
you belong with the bums.

460
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:33,710
You shut your mouth or
I'll cut you baby.

461
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:36,510
And nobody will fuck your ugly cunt.

462
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,900
Why did you have to do
that to him?

463
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,700
He was a good man.

464
00:49:31,741 --> 00:49:34,100
He never did anything to you.

465
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,810
That's a dead body.

466
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:43,010
Now, let me see.

467
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:59,090
That's an alien craft.

468
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,100
That's an alien craft?

469
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,300
Isn't it kind of small?

470
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,910
The alien craft is about the size
of a dinner plate,

471
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:15,510
Who ever told you that aliens
need as much space as people?

472
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:20,580
Well, that's really quite
a world that you showed me.

473
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:24,690
You're a scientist as tall as
the empire state building.

474
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:26,690
and the aliens are as big as...

475
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:29,490
Jumbo shrimp.

476
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:35,700
I've available no other
world to show you.

477
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,500
Well, isn't it possible that that
might be a child's toy?

478
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,610
And not a UFO?

479
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:46,510
Don't worry, forget it...

480
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:51,080
We'll leave this fucking
place, baby, and we'll go to Berlin.

481
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,380
I wanna sing in the night clubs.

482
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,090
Germans love me...
We'll be happy.

483
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:04,390
What are we gonna do
with this body?

484
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:06,400
Don't worry about the body...

485
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,600
I know what to do,
you wanna do it right now?

486
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,600
Are you sure this has
something to do with the UFO?

487
00:51:12,641 --> 00:51:14,400
Looks like two women just
killed a man.

488
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,510
This is not my first encounter
with the aliens.

489
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:24,680
Just watch in the long run
you will see what happens there.

490
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Why don't they call the police?

491
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,410
Why don't we call the police?

492
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:53,310
They don't want the police
to be involved.

493
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,010
Why?

494
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:59,280
Everyone has his own reasons
for avoiding the authorites
in their home.

495
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:02,480
They have a very good reason,
they've heroin there.

496
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:06,890
I sure wouldn't like to be
in their shoes right now.

497
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,490
I wouldn't like it either.

498
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,990
What are we gonna do?

499
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:41,490
Just leave him there,
we're going to Berlin baby, aren't we?

500
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:43,690
Sure.

501
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:47,800
We should have a wake.

502
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,200
There's no food.

503
00:52:49,241 --> 00:52:52,400
So I go to the store
and get some food.

504
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:56,000
These are no protection
for aliens.

505
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:59,410
Oh! And do you have protection
for aliens?

506
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:02,610
You have a laser down in your pants?

507
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,080
I think I need another drink.

508
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:18,390
Wake up, honey...

509
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:21,200
Come on get up and take a shower.

510
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,300
I feel sick, Kathy.

511
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,300
I know you feel sick.
You took drugs today.

512
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,400
No...

513
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:32,510
Come on and stand up
It'll make you feel better.

514
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:35,610
Guests are already starting to arrive.
Can't miss the party.

515
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:37,880
Fuck the guests.

516
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:40,680
You are brave, noble knight.

517
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,990
Why don't you go overthere and
freed those two beauties from the dragon?

518
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:55,300
It's exactly what I'm gonna do.

519
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,600
You're going...over to the appartment?

520
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,910
No the little one just went out,
I  want to try to warn her.

521
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:06,710
Are you serious?

522
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,810
Yes.

523
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:12,280
Well you're really a brave.

524
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:16,190
You're the first man to ever leave me
just before we're about to have dinner.

525
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:18,990
Fuck the guests.

526
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:22,990
Fuck the party.
Just gonna sleep.

527
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:28,100
Be serious.

528
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,500
I'm ab-so-fucking-lutely serious.

529
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:32,400
Don't talk to me like that.

530
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,310
Why can't I?

531
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:40,510
Because...

532
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:45,480
Because this is your place,
because you pay for anything

533
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:46,980
Let's not start that subject again.

534
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,890
I didn't start that subject, you did,
I don't care...

535
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:53,390
I'm sorry but I'll be right back.

536
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:56,090
Oh don't expect me to wait for you.

537
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:59,500
I don't like cold chinese food.

538
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:03,600
I don't intend to start
liking it now.

539
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I'm sorry but duty is more
important than shrimps.

540
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,510
Well the duty is yours
the house is mine.

541
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:15,610
And in my house shrimps are more
important than duty.

542
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:19,480
I'm going to sleep.

543
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,980
Right?

544
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,890
You ruined your carrer
and now you want to ruin mine?

545
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:27,490
You know I've invited
everybody to this.

546
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:30,990
Do you know how hard
I've worked to make everything perfect,

547
00:55:31,031 --> 00:55:33,200
and you've not lifted
a finger to help me!

548
00:55:33,241 --> 00:55:37,400
Now you want to humiliate me
and embarass me in front of my clients.

549
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,900
You wanna just prove to everybody
that you're a failure.

550
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,510
That you take dope, you take drugs,
that you haven't made any money

551
00:55:43,551 --> 00:55:47,610
from any of your films, your books
or anything you've ever done, mainly.

552
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,680
You want to humiliate me,
that's your point.

553
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:56,290
But I'm such a fool to love you.

554
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:01,590
Well, if you don't like me, leave!

555
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:08,000
This is my house...
Leave my house!

556
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:12,600
You either get dressed up and
behave like you have some self respect

557
00:56:12,641 --> 00:56:14,800
you'd just leave!

558
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:34,090
Steve, will you fix me a drink please?

559
00:56:34,131 --> 00:56:35,990
Sure.

560
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:39,900
Having a problem with the
Neanderthal man back there?

561
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,100
Yeah.

562
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,900
Relax, you're fabulous.

563
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,500
Don't make a penny of
domestic quarrels.

564
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,890
What are you staring at big cock?

565
00:57:03,931 --> 00:57:05,690
Sorry I wish I knew how to tell you...

566
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:09,190
If you got something to say
copper, just spit it out.

567
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:12,090
You are in a dangerous situation.

568
00:57:12,131 --> 00:57:14,300
Man, listen let me tell you something

569
00:57:14,341 --> 00:57:17,100
you guys won't catch me, man, never!

570
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,700
And I don't understand why you're
being so stupid copper

571
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,600
to let me know what's coming down
that's really dumb.

572
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,410
Copper? What does that mean,
I can help you.

573
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:25,010
Fuck off, get out of my way.

574
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:27,210
You don't understand, I can help you.

575
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:28,710
Oh! You're a rat man.

576
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:31,780
You want me to put you on the take,
so you'll let me know

577
00:57:31,821 --> 00:57:34,080
when your invasion come in?

578
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:35,980
Invasion? Yeah what do you know
about the invasion?

579
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:38,090
Oh, shut your face scab,
I don't play it your way.

580
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,490
Just forget it fuck off, man!

581
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:43,290
I don't need you man! Fuck off!

582
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,400
Still sitting in front of the mirror.

583
00:58:29,441 --> 00:58:30,910
Adrian is here.

584
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:35,510
I didn't come here to see Adrian.

585
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:37,780
Well I don't have any dope for you.

586
00:58:37,821 --> 00:58:39,980
You have to see her about that.

587
00:58:40,021 --> 00:58:41,580
I don't want any dope.

588
00:58:41,621 --> 00:58:42,790
What do you want?

589
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:44,790
Entertain you.

590
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:47,090
So, how do you expect
to entertain me?

591
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:50,990
Well, men have always
entertained women.

592
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:53,900
I'm gonna show you...the difference.

593
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,800
Between men and women.

594
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Don't make me laugh.

595
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,600
I'm not gonna make you laugh.

596
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,810
I'm gonna make you come.

597
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:05,510
So what?

598
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,410
I can come with or without you.

599
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:11,380
You think I can't get it up, hmm?

600
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:18,390
I don't care, I wanna fuck with
someone else but not you.

601
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:23,390
Oh I thought you wished
for a big hard man.

602
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:27,500
Seems to me that too many men
today are telling me what I want.

603
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,600
What I'm wishing is that you would leave.

604
00:59:29,641 --> 00:59:33,100
What are you gonna do if I stay
call the cops?

605
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,900
They'd love the chance
to make love with you.

606
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:39,010
You think that sexy become
I'm turned on by that?

607
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,910
Make me sick you big junkie.

608
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,780
Fucking dyke.

609
00:59:46,821 --> 00:59:49,590
You're just a dyke.

610
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:54,590
You're so attractive to me I'm just
coming and coming.

611
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:57,790
Shut up cunt!
You're not coming yet!

612
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:00,900
I wanna fuck you till you know
what it means.

613
01:00:00,941 --> 01:00:01,800
Dyke!

614
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:05,000
You sick pig, I don't need
your cock or anything.

615
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:10,310
You're nothing you're nobody,
you're nothing you're nothing.

616
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:12,610
Alright wore, I'm gonna be sorry.

617
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:18,980

619
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,290

you're just a fly.

620
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,980
-Hi there.
-Hi.

621
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,990
Just set it down there, OK?

622
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:05,490
Are you studying the stars

623
01:01:05,531 --> 01:01:07,700

624

Thank you!

01:01:12,341 --> 01:01:13,400
Oh my god!

627
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,310
Oh add out 20 percent.

628
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:20,110
Very good, thank you.

629
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:22,810
I'm falling asleep I'm tired,
I'm falling asleep and you're boring me to death.

630
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:27,680

01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:34,590

637
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:08,280
Sorry, you're eating.

638
01:03:08,321 --> 01:03:11,490
Oh It's my pleasure.

639
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:13,690
How did you meeting go with the girl?

640
01:03:13,731 --> 01:03:15,290
She didn't believe me.

641
01:03:15,331 --> 01:03:18,490
Who would believe a man who's
capable of waiting till the shrimps get cold?

642
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,500
Oh, what did you got?

643
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,900
This is for you.
This is what I drink.

644
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,510
Oh, thank you.

645
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:35,010
Start getting your dinner,
I shouldn't start talking about your duty again.

646
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:38,580
Here, open it.

647
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:41,180
Hey you?

648
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:46,090
Hey you?

649
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:52,190
What's with these glass
arrows in the head?

650
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:55,500
To the last of your project.

651
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:59,000
To the beautiful

652
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:02,910
I can't have all these bodies.

653
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:06,310
Just seems like that every body is
involved with drugs

654
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:09,110
not only teenagers but everybody.

655
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:11,880
And now you're telling me
that aliens have come here

656
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:15,780
and they're also looking for drugs.
It's just incredible.

657
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:22,290
Corpses...all these corpses here.
Dead people...

658
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:27,100
Please...no more bodies.

659
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:39,210
It is for me?

660
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:43,880
You did that for me Chief?

661
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:45,580
Why?

662
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,290
Why don't you come to me?

663
01:04:50,331 --> 01:04:53,990
It seems to be strange that the aliens
are interested in heroin

664
01:04:54,031 --> 01:04:56,090
but there could be a lot
of reasons for that.

665
01:04:56,190 --> 01:05:01,100
We now know because of the research
of few American scientists in the late 70's.

666
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,900
There are special receptors,
opiate receptors in the human brain.

667
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:13,010
Heroin, codeine, morphine
all belong to the same chemical family

668
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:15,510
derived from the poppy,
they' re called opiates.

669
01:05:15,551 --> 01:05:18,980
So that's what they found
these Americans.

670
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:21,680
That there are special receptors
in the human brain

671
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:23,490
to receive opiate molecules.

672
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:30,390
What are these opiate receptors
doing sitting around in the human brain?

673
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:34,300
Waiting for someone to come along
and give them heroin?

674
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,600
Look what I got for you.

675
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:44,010
Some physicians think...

676
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:48,010
There's a naturally occuring molecule,
in the human body.

677
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:52,380
That is nearly the same molecular
structure as opiates.

678
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:58,490
Oh you mean to say that opium
occurs naturally in the human body?

679
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:03,890
Not opium, I said nearly the same
molecular structure, nearly the same properties

680
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:09,000
Opium users have said that the drug
creates a similar feeling

681
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:12,500
to what people experience
during orgasm.

682
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:18,110
Could be that this molecule is
realeased into the brain during orgasm.

683
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:22,710
During orgasm?

684
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,580
That's very interesting.

685
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,780
Are you gonna fuck him?

686
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:31,490
He's dead. He's beautiful.

687
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:35,790
I'm not playing house baby,
you are. You fuck him.

688
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:39,190
Get him real juicy.

689
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,300
Stick him in the oven
then we'll fuck.

690
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,800
I know it always cheered you up
before? A good fuck.

691
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,200
Please continue about orgasm.

692
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:52,710
I have a theory.
If all humans have in their brains

693
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:57,880
some substantial process
based on the opiate mechanism of action

694
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:01,380
why can't they exist somewhere
on the universe some other

695
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:04,190
form of life which would depend
on this mechanism,

696
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:06,090
even more...

697
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:09,590
this would attract the alien to heroin.

698
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:14,700
Well according to you to
humans as well during orgasm.

699
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,800
Well,

700
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:31,080
Well, doesn't that mean that
orgasms are dangerous?

701
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:46,800
Yo!

702
01:07:46,841 --> 01:07:48,800
It's Jimmy!

703
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,000
So looks like he found some
money for some stuff.

704
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:03,380
or something

705
01:08:03,421 --> 01:08:05,680
I forgot.

706
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:08,380
I mean, I forgot the time.

707
01:08:08,421 --> 01:08:09,590
I'm not ready.

708
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:12,190
Don't worry about it,
that's what their job is,

709
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:14,890
they gonna fix you beautifully.

710
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:19,900
Don't move...I love it,
the chicken is great,

711
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,100
Let me get a shot at him.

712
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,400
What are you doing? You can't
go around snapping pictures

713
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:26,100
at people when they're not ready!

714
01:08:26,141 --> 01:08:29,510
Calm down darling,
I've got some cocaine for you.

715
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:31,610
And I don't want any bakery.

716
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:34,710
We're gonna have
a marvelous time.

717
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:39,980
Margaret this is Nelly,
she's the fashionary from Midnight Magazine.

718
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,380
She has longer legs than yours,
hasn't she Margaret?

719
01:08:42,450 --> 01:08:44,290
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

720
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:46,290
You don't mind do you?

721
01:08:46,331 --> 01:08:50,290
-Recording your doing.
-Turn it off...now.

722
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,200
If she doesn't want, she doesn't want.

723
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,100
Why?

724
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,010
nasty things this morning?

725
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:07,010
you know where they
have the drugs?

726
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:09,910
How should I know?
Ask Jack.

727
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,280
Drugs?

728
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,680
Don't be impatient, be cool.

729
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:23,490
Brian was right, your roof is perfect.

730
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:31,300
This fucking city is really something.

731
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:36,810
What have you done to yourself now.

732
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:39,010
She can't hide it.
A chicken is a chicken.

733
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:41,710
Come on Jimmy. You're both
so beautiful

734
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:44,480
and you look alike.
Be nice.

735
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:46,080
I'm not a chicken.

736
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:48,480
-Ouch!
-I'm sorry Jimmy!

737
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:50,990
I didn't know your scalp was
so sensitive.

738
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:57,190
Now don't get anything dirty,
and tape the tags on the inside

739
01:09:57,590 --> 01:10:00,100
It's not necessary to cut them.

740
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,700
Where's the cocaine?

741
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,600
Dwayne?

742
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,300
Would you fix us a few
lines, darling?

743
01:10:09,341 --> 01:10:12,810
Here, I've got some
blow too, baby.

744
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:17,980
I'd like to ask you a few questions
over your childhood.

745
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:19,480
Come here, legs.

746
01:10:19,521 --> 01:10:22,890
Can't you see she's busy?
I'll tell you about her childhood.

747
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,500
Margaret dropped from Connecticut.

748
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:43,310
She went to church every sunday.

749
01:10:43,351 --> 01:10:45,810
This is when she was sixteen.

750
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:31,280
What are you doing?

751
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:35,280
This is my hair, you could at least
consult me about it.

752
01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:38,790
I think, Jane, the hairdresser...

753
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:40,290
Hair stylist.

754
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:42,690
Hair stylist is right.

755
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:46,400
We don't need this accessory.

756
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,300
The image should be simple.

757
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Your photographs that Adrian
was just showing me

758
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:27,400
indicate a fairly traditional
upbringing.

759
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:31,610
And you slipped to a weird off with
some obscure fantasy look.

760
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:43,990
spirit of paradise everyday
in Las Vegas and better.

761
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:45,990
It's tacky.

762
01:13:50,890 --> 01:13:52,390
You're tacky.

763
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:03,010
What do you mean by wearing all
this weird make up and strange clothes?

764
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:10,180
Nothing.

765
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:17,190
You don't admit to dressing
strange?

766
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:21,890
You're strange.

767
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:28,300
What do you mean by that?
I'm not wearing rags.

768
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,700
You're wearing what they want
from you...baby.

769
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:36,610
America!

770
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:39,210
What do you mean America?

771
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:41,710
I'm American, she's American.

772
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:44,680
He's American.

773
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,480
Where're you from?

774
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,680
-Detroit.
-Las Vegas.

775
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,690
-I'm coming from Montana.
-El Paso.

776
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:53,090
-Where are you from?
-Philadelphia.

777
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:55,490
See we got the whole country
representative.

778
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:56,990
-Right.
-It's the melting pot.

779
01:14:57,031 --> 01:14:59,400
And this chicken is Miss America
of the eighties.

780
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,900
No Jimmy, you are.

781
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:16,680
No. I think Margaret is Miss America.

782
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,180
I think it's Jimmy.

783
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,680
You just say that
because you're gay.

784
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:22,480
Oh he's not gay all the time.

785
01:15:22,521 --> 01:15:25,190
I seriously think Jimmy is
the new Miss America.

786
01:15:25,231 --> 01:15:27,490
He has all the mannerisms
of a sex symbol.

787
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:31,390
That's what we should call this
make it a series.

788
01:15:32,290 --> 01:15:34,300
The two miss Americas.

789
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,600
Great idea. And we could end it
with the two of them fucking.

790
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,300
He can't fuck.

791
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,000
I can too fuck.

792
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:43,510
I just can't fuck you.

793
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:46,610
You two are just too chicken to be
photographed fucking.

794
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:49,210
Chicken woman.

795
01:15:49,251 --> 01:15:51,080
He's the chicken not I.

796
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:53,480
That sounds like a challenge
to me, Jimmy.

797
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,480
You're just a chicken.

798
01:16:04,090 --> 01:16:05,790
You're just a chicken.

799
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:09,800
Please don't start
on me now.

800
01:16:09,841 --> 01:16:11,800
You look tired.

801
01:16:11,841 --> 01:16:13,500
You look old...

802
01:16:13,541 --> 01:16:16,710
...and ugly and washed up.

803
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:20,510
Stop it! Jimmy
you don't understand anything.

804
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:23,780
What I don't understand anything
is why anybody

805
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,680
would want to take your picture.

806
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,080
That's what I don't understand.

807
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:35,590
You're just a freak.

808
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:37,390
A weirdo.

809
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:39,800
Behind your back everybody
laughs.

810
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,200
They call you chicken woman.

811
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:45,600
That's why you look just
like her.

812
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:53,010
Such a sweet point.

813
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:57,280
Don't step on that shoe,
we'll have to pay for it.

814
01:16:57,321 --> 01:17:01,080
C'mon! C'mon!

815
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:03,390
One day the chicken woman
had chicks.

816
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:07,890
And everybody stepped on,
cause they were so ugly...

817
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:12,490
Don't talk to her like that.

818
01:17:12,531 --> 01:17:16,000
We still have two rolls of film.

819
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:20,600
Old Mac Donald had a farm
E...I...E...I...O

820
01:17:20,641 --> 01:17:24,910
and on his farm he had some chicken.
E...I...E...I...O

821
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:28,010
With a chick, chick here
and a chick, chick there

822
01:17:28,051 --> 01:17:29,010
Here a chick...chick there,
Chick Everywhere a chick chick

823
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:33,080
Old Mac Donald had a farm
E...I...E...I...O

824
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:43,890
What is going on?
What is going on?

825
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:46,500
Why are they all being
so mean?

826
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,100
Being mean here and in the club
is no fucking difference

827
01:17:50,141 --> 01:17:52,900
than all those
fuckers out on the street.

828
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,100
Or anybody else in
the goddamn world.

829
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:58,310
The only difference is out there
they all pretend to be nice.

830
01:17:58,410 --> 01:18:01,510
And in here we ain't
pretending shit.

831
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,780
What do you mean
nobody's pretending?

832
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:12,890
We're all dressed up like for a masquerade
going on stage playing hoodlums.

833
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:15,990
famous bags.

834
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:21,500
The biggest eye bags around
chicken with the eye bag.

835
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,900
It's just like a three penny

836
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,100
You're too old to model.

837
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,200
Don't make me hate you!

838
01:18:27,241 --> 01:18:29,510
You're so ugly.

839
01:18:29,551 --> 01:18:31,810
And you are so beautiful.

840
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:39,680
You're the most beautiful
boy in the world.

841
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:47,080
You're the most beautiful
boy.

842
01:18:51,490 --> 01:18:52,900
What?

843
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:58,300
I don't care what you say.
I don't love you.

844
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,310
Margaret what's wrong with you?

845
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:03,610
Let me see your eyes.

846
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:11,180
God what eyes.

847
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:13,180
Chicken woman.

848
01:19:13,221 --> 01:19:14,680
C'mon, Jimmy!

849
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:16,690
And your lips.

850
01:19:19,190 --> 01:19:22,190
You're so old and ugly,
I can't look at you.

851
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:26,600
Come on, she's beautiful.

852
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:34,100
No, I know I'm ugly you should punish me
I'm not good enough for you.

853
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:37,600
I'm just an old and ugly whore.

854
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:40,110
The oldest and the ugliest.

855
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:45,280
You should beat me.

856
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:46,490
If you want...

857
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:48,790
-Beat her?
-Come on, do it!

858
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:50,490
Move the lights, pay attention!

859
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:53,290
Get out of the way,
quicly, quickly!

860
01:19:57,090 --> 01:19:58,700
Yeah you want me to hate you?

861
01:19:58,741 --> 01:20:01,200
Whatever you want I'll do it.

862
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:10,210
I'm so ugly and you're so
beautiful I think you should hit me.

863
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:16,110
C'mon, hit me.
Hit me,

864
01:20:16,151 --> 01:20:18,380
You ugly old whore,
you make me sick.

865
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:23,090
Cunt!

866
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:28,790
Let me see your beautiful cock.
And let me do it for you baby.

867
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:32,390
I'll do it and you could hit me
if I do it wrong.

868
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,510
Beg for it.

869
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:49,210
You asked for it.

870
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:51,980
Let me see your beautiful cock.

871
01:20:52,021 --> 01:20:55,180
Come on baby, I'll do it good.

872
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:57,690
Come on.

873
01:20:57,890 --> 01:20:59,690
Give it to me.

874
01:20:59,990 --> 01:21:01,800
Give it to me.

875
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,200
I can't.

876
01:21:14,241 --> 01:21:16,610
Do it!

877
01:21:16,651 --> 01:21:18,010
Do it!

878
01:21:20,110 --> 01:21:21,510
I can't.

879
01:21:23,110 --> 01:21:24,780
Beg for it.

880
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,080
Look at yourself.

881
01:21:27,010 --> 01:21:29,390
Look at yourself.

882
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:31,090
Look at yourself.

883
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:36,990
You are the most beautiful boy,
you are the most beautiful fucker.

884
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:39,600
We want to see you fuck her.

885
01:21:39,641 --> 01:21:40,600
Fuck her!

886
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:42,400
Get him, Margaret you whore.

887
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,000
Do it!

888
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,000
Give it to me baby.

889
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:50,610
Do it!

890
01:21:50,810 --> 01:21:52,610
I can't.

891
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:55,210
Come on! You can do it!

892
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:05,890
You whore.

893
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:12,000
Do it!

894
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,910
Come on Margaret.

895
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:22,680
Do it!

896
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,810
Let's go!

897
01:23:32,410 --> 01:23:33,410
What for?

898
01:23:33,710 --> 01:23:35,280
Let's go!

899
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:41,290
You made me do it.

900
01:23:45,090 --> 01:23:48,090
This pussy has teeth no one
should fuck me ever.

901
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:52,190
What did you do with him, Margaret?

902
01:23:52,590 --> 01:23:54,300
I can't...

903
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,800
So where's the body?

904
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,700
I don't know.

905
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,510
Would somebody look on the roof.

906
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,680
Nothing out here.

907
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,590
What's in the box?

908
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:19,490
Was it a magic trick?

909
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:24,600
No, Ann, it's no magic trick, I keep
dead bodies in so I can fuck 'em.

910
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,200
Adrian, you should leave me
alone.

911
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:30,700
You should leave me
alone.

912
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,200
What are you talking about?

913
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:34,910
I can.

914
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:36,800
How?

915
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:39,210
I killed the people that fucked me.

916
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:41,480
That's it, if you fuck me you'll die.

917
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:45,080
Come on, baby!

918
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:47,480
No, it's true!

919
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:49,390
It's not true.

920
01:24:49,490 --> 01:24:51,090
I'm serious.

921
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:52,790
I'm serious too.

922
01:24:52,990 --> 01:24:54,690
Hey you!

923
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:59,690
How many people want me
see me fuck Margaret and not die?

924
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,900
It's too much Adrian

925
01:25:01,941 --> 01:25:03,700
Lay off!

926
01:25:03,741 --> 01:25:06,300
There's something very strange
going on here.

927
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,200
I'm going to leave.

928
01:25:08,241 --> 01:25:11,210
Right there's something strange
going on here.

929
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:15,410
I bet you 300$ that I can fuck
Margaret and not die.

930
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:17,480
Of course she won't die.

931
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:21,380
But I'm not sure watching you
fuck is worth 300$.

932
01:25:22,490 --> 01:25:25,090
But it sure sounds interesting.

933
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:27,990
I'd like to watch but I'm not sure
Margaret's in the mood.

934
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:30,790
Adrian! You should stay away
from me, I'm a killer.

935
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:34,800
You like to fuck, baby, better
than anything in the world.

936
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,200
I don't want you!

937
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:39,500
Why not?

938
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,410
Because I'm killing all
the people that I fuck.

939
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:49,510
You kill me bitch, that's
the joke of all time.

940
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:53,380
Adrian...

941
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:57,490
Leave me alone.

942
01:25:57,690 --> 01:25:58,890
You like it honey?

943
01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:00,990
You like it...

944
01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:02,190
Don't do it, Adrian.

945
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:05,790
These good people want to see
me fuck you now.

946
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:09,000
No! We're gonna go away,
We're gonna go away.

947
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:11,900
We're going to Berlin.
Right after you fuck me.

948
01:26:11,941 --> 01:26:13,900
No! No! No! No!

949
01:26:18,810 --> 01:26:20,010
Berlin.

950
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:24,480
Help me hold her down, she likes it.

951
01:26:24,521 --> 01:26:26,080
It's Ok.

952
01:26:32,490 --> 01:26:34,490
It's Ok baby,

953
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:43,510
No!

954
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:46,110
You'll die Adrian!

955
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:48,780
Kill me baby!

956
01:26:49,780 --> 01:26:50,780
Kill me baby!

957
01:26:57,980 --> 01:26:59,380
No!

958
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:26,500
What have we done?

959
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:28,610
Wait a minute.

960
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:31,210
We think clearly this
cannot be explained.

961
01:27:33,010 --> 01:27:35,210
It's easy to explain.

962
01:27:44,290 --> 01:27:47,200
You wanna know who
and what I am?

963
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:49,700
I'm a killer.

964
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:54,410
I kill with my cunt.

965
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:01,510
You can write about it...

966
01:28:01,810 --> 01:28:04,410
in Midnight Magazine.

967
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:06,980
Or National Enquirer.

968
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:16,990
It's gonna be a new sensation.

969
01:28:45,190 --> 01:28:47,690
You wanted to know
where I'm from?

970
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:50,290
I'm from connecticut.

971
01:28:50,590 --> 01:28:52,290
Mayflower stock.

972
01:29:01,310 --> 01:29:03,510
I was taught that my prince would come.

973
01:29:03,710 --> 01:29:07,910
And he would be a lawyer and I would
have his children.

974
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:10,710
And in the week ends
we would barbecue.

975
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:15,180
And all the other princes and their
princesses would come:

976
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:19,590
and they would say delicious,
delicious,

977
01:29:20,690 --> 01:29:22,290
Or, how boring!

978
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:41,210
So I was taught,

979
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:45,980
that I should come to New-York
and become an independant model.

980
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:51,990
And my prince would come
and he would be...

981
01:29:53,290 --> 01:29:55,490
an agent.

982
01:29:57,190 --> 01:29:59,500
And he would get me a role.

983
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,300
And I would make my living
waiting on tables.

984
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:09,100
I would wait till thirty...
till forty...till fifty.

985
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:18,480
And I was taught that to
be an actress

986
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:22,380
one should be fashionable.

987
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:25,490
And to befashionable is
to be androgenous.

988
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:31,590
And I'm androgenous not less
that David Bowie himself.

989
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,900
They call me beautiful.

990
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,910
And I kill with my cunt.

991
01:30:48,410 --> 01:30:50,980
Isn't it fashionable?

992
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,980
Come on who's next?

993
01:30:55,990 --> 01:30:57,490
I take lessons.

994
01:30:58,090 --> 01:31:00,490
How to get into show business.

995
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:02,470
Be nice to your professor,

996
01:31:05,570 --> 01:31:07,570
be nice to your agent.

997
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:13,000
Be nice to your audience.
Be nice.

998
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:17,010
How to be a woman?

999
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:19,980
Want them when they want you.

1000
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:31,990
How to be free and equal.

1001
01:31:32,190 --> 01:31:34,790
Fuck women instead of men

1002
01:31:34,890 --> 01:31:38,300
and you'll discover
a whole kingdom of freedom.

1003
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:43,000
Men won't step on you anymore.

1004
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:46,800
Women will.

1005
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:51,310
So come on, who's next?

1006
01:31:51,410 --> 01:31:53,410
Who wants to teach me?

1007
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:55,980
Come on! Teach me.

1008
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,680
Are you afraid?

1009
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:01,580
You're right.

1010
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:04,490
Because they're all dead.

1011
01:32:04,690 --> 01:32:07,490
All my teachers.

1012
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:14,400
-What time is it?
-What?

1013
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:17,700
We go to the club.

1014
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:20,700
We go to the club,
we'll dance.

1015
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,800
There's nothing else to do,
we might as well dance.

1016
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,100
Come on let's go,
let's go.

1017
01:32:35,780 --> 01:32:40,380
-Are you looking for Adrian?
-Adrian is dead, it's every man for himself.

1018
01:34:24,490 --> 01:34:28,000
I'm delighted to see you,
you don't know how it thrills me.

1019
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:31,000
-You're glad?
-Sure I'm baby you're the man.

1020
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:33,710
I love your sexy body.

1021
01:34:37,710 --> 01:34:40,610
-You're freaky.
-Sure I'm baby, freaky for you.

1022
01:34:41,010 --> 01:34:41,710
Let's go to my place.
Come on.

1023
01:34:43,210 --> 01:34:47,080
Well now that we've had dinner
and coffee and everything...

1024
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:50,280
Why don't you take off
your jacket

1025
01:34:50,321 --> 01:34:52,790
and make yourself
at home.

1026
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:58,490
I really should
update my notes.

1027
01:34:58,890 --> 01:35:02,600
You're absolutely right,
now is "the" perfect time.

1028
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:10,810
This is gonna be the fuck
of your lifetime.

1029
01:35:13,310 --> 01:35:15,810
-I got some coke.
-I don't care about that.

1030
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:18,980
I just want you...now.

1031
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:25,990
Orgasms, wasn't that the subject
we were discussing?

1032
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:31,590
I think that right now I should
study the alien.

1033
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:34,500
Two aliens have orgasms.

1034
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:38,210
They don't even have bodies.

1035
01:35:40,710 --> 01:35:43,710
Oh! You're an alien in
this country.

1036
01:35:44,510 --> 01:35:48,710
And I wouldn't certainly complain
about your body.

1037
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:50,480
Do sit down.

1038
01:35:56,990 --> 01:36:00,090
Well being a German alien
and a scientist.

1039
01:36:01,790 --> 01:36:05,690
What do you think about
German alien orgasms?

1040
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,500
I want you now.

1041
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:32,590
That's too good.
What's your hurry?

1042
01:36:32,690 --> 01:36:36,090
I'll do anything you want.
Do you want to hit me?

1043
01:36:36,790 --> 01:36:39,500
You are sick.

1044
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:45,100
Sure I'm baby, I've got so many problems
with my brain it's a real pain in the ass.

1045
01:36:45,141 --> 01:36:47,300
Ho, yeah.

1046
01:36:47,341 --> 01:36:49,510
Look stop, I'm gonna come.

1047
01:36:49,551 --> 01:36:51,410
Give it to me, baby,
give it to me.

1048
01:36:51,451 --> 01:36:54,610
come on , come on.

1049
01:36:57,610 --> 01:37:00,680
Suppose orgasms are killing people.

1050
01:37:03,190 --> 01:37:07,090
What would you say about a person
who had multiple orgasms?

1051
01:37:08,490 --> 01:37:12,190
I would say this person is very sick.

1052
01:37:12,590 --> 01:37:17,100
And  would you be interested
into studying such a person?

1053
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:20,300
Being a scientist?

1054
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,400
And German alien?

1055
01:37:30,670 --> 01:37:31,970
Come on...

1056
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,280
Give it to me.

1057
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,380
Give it to me.

1058
01:38:14,090 --> 01:38:19,490
I'm sorry, I can't stay,
I must go with, she's in great danger.

1059
01:38:25,490 --> 01:38:26,890
I'm sorry.

1060
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:40,180
Shit.

1061
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:46,080
Excuse me, do you know anybody here
by the name of Adrian?

1062
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:47,380
Sure.

1063
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:10,810
Come out!

1064
01:40:12,710 --> 01:40:14,410
Come out in the end.

1065
01:40:16,210 --> 01:40:18,380
We got them all.

1066
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:21,280
Is there one left?

1067
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:23,480
We can meet together now.

1068
01:40:30,890 --> 01:40:33,300
Where are you?

1069
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:37,800
Why don't you come out?

1070
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:30,690
What do you want?

1071
01:41:30,990 --> 01:41:33,590
My name is Jurgen Hoffman,
I'm a scientist.

1072
01:41:33,790 --> 01:41:37,090
I've come to get you out of here.
We should leave immediately.

1073
01:41:37,290 --> 01:41:39,100
What do you know?

1074
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:41,400
I've watched through this window.

1075
01:41:41,441 --> 01:41:43,300
I've witnessed the deaths
from over there.

1076
01:41:43,341 --> 01:41:45,300
I know how and why
they died.

1077
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,300
You're in great danger, come with me.

1078
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:49,910
So you tell me why they died.

1079
01:41:50,010 --> 01:41:53,000
What difference does it make to you?
Now. Come with me.

1080
01:41:53,410 --> 01:41:55,180
Wait a minute you come to my
place and you want me to leave

1081
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:56,980
and you don't want to tell me why?

1082
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:00,180
Ok, you have a creature,
an alien creature on your roof.

1083
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:02,280
Where?

1084
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:04,690
I study these creatures.

1085
01:42:07,490 --> 01:42:09,490
You're in great danger, come with me.

1086
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:11,690
-Tell me where he is.
-You want to die?

1087
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:14,400
-No.
-Let me explain.

1088
01:42:14,450 --> 01:42:16,600
-Let me go.
-Let me explain.

1089
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:21,470
My theory is that these creatures,
aliens feed of people

1090
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:24,400
like we feed about other creatures,
and that they need for substinance

1091
01:42:24,450 --> 01:42:27,100
a substance similar to opiates,
heroin is an opiate,

1092
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:31,210
so this one can hear for it
but they found something better!

1093
01:42:31,310 --> 01:42:35,110
That substance is produced in
the brain during an orgasm and is similar

1094
01:42:35,660 --> 01:42:37,400
in chemical structure to opiates.

1095
01:42:37,441 --> 01:42:39,410
It is the key to get this substance.

1096
01:42:40,090 --> 01:42:43,090
Why didn't he kill me?

1097
01:42:43,290 --> 01:42:46,000
Did you have an orgasm?

1098
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:49,600
No!

1099
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:55,100
In the end, in the end...

1100
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:57,310
Where are you?

1101
01:42:57,410 --> 01:42:58,510
Why don't you come out?

1102
01:43:00,910 --> 01:43:01,780
Over there...

1103
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:24,000
In the end.

1104
01:43:24,041 --> 01:43:25,800
In the end come on now.

1105
01:43:25,841 --> 01:43:28,100
We can be together now.

1106
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:29,600
Come out!

1107
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:31,710
You can feed on me if you want.

1108
01:43:32,110 --> 01:43:34,110
It's OK.
I don't mind.

1109
01:43:35,010 --> 01:43:37,080
Now you care for me.

1110
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:39,780
We can be happy.

1111
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:42,580
I wanna make love with you.

1112
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:55,400
No!

1113
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:02,510
You can't leave me.

1114
01:44:02,610 --> 01:44:04,610
Don't leave without me.

1115
01:44:05,210 --> 01:44:07,780
No! No!

1116
01:45:56,590 --> 01:46:02,190
Excuse me, I'm in a tremendous rush,
I can't make any stop

1117
01:46:02,290 --> 01:46:05,190
I've got to go strait to the penthouse.

1118
01:46:05,290 --> 01:46:08,600
The penthouse, that's the same as
