1
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:59,514
The Terrorizers

2
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:08,459
It's almost daybreak!

3
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:12,300
I'll be done soon

4
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,697
Did I bother you?

5
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,501
Take this to the wash

6
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,834
It's gotten warm

7
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,140
What's wrong? Can't sleep again?

8
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,679
Thinking of the other rewrite

9
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,226
The closer the deadline
the less inspired I get

10
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,798
Another rewrite?

11
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,892
I've never seen you this distressed

12
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,898
Relax

13
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:36,204
Writing a novel
shouldn't be this life-consuming

14
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,781
Thought it was a small gambling den

15
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,582
But they are armed with guns

16
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:17,850
How many pieces they've got?

17
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,249
Not sure.

18
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,521
Should've called the Assault squad

19
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,955
I did. Should be here soon

20
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,425
Who blew the whistle?

21
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,222
It was the landlord

22
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,772
Freeze!

23
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,609
Spread'em out!

24
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,053
Don't move!

25
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:25,186
It happened on the first day of spring

26
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,328
If you truly feel for the seasons

27
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,533
you'll discover that changes are
merely endless rebirths of the past

28
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:37,369
This spring, it is no different

29
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,939
To this married couple

30
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,306
their most serious problem was...

31
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,536
Chief died of a stroke last night!

32
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,372
We heard

33
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,566
We were just talking about it

34
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,640
Everyone is shocked!

35
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,570
Well, I sort of suspected

36
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,135
something would come up

37
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,078
But I didn't expect it
to be a stroke though

38
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,581
Didrt you notice
he acted kind of weird lately?

39
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,423
His life was so boring

40
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:58,257
small incidents

41
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,624
would turn into big troubles for him

42
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,958
I heard he had an affair
with another woman

43
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,930
and his wife found out

44
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,497
It's all hearsay though

45
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,538
Well, I doubt it

46
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,572
You can never tell

47
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:20,303
He really smoked too much

48
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,505
A can'ton only lasted him 2 or 3 days

49
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,468
What I'm concerned about is his family

50
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,665
like his childrers educational funds,
the funeral, etc...

51
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:47,673
Well, I feel the late Chief

52
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,300
had made great contributions
to the hospital

53
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,912
and I feel from now on...

54
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:56,109
We do have our policies
regarding all these

55
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,918
We'll make all the arrangements
accordingly

56
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,886
Yes, yes. I see...

57
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:05,490
By the way, who has seniority
between you and Jing?

58
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,151
Well, we started at the same time

59
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,428
We graduated the same year
from the same school

60
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:14,058
We were employed together
by the hospital

61
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:17,432
I was like him no family connections
totally on our own.

62
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:21,966
I like my job. It's stable...

63
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:25,371
I had an offer elsewhere
with much higher pay...

64
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,843
But I felt it was less secure,

65
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,470
so I turned it down

66
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,545
I'm used to this job

67
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,944
and I deeply believe if I work hard

68
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,250
I'll be rewarded
with career advancements

69
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,721
Sir, are you saying that...

70
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,091
Oh, nothing, I just wondering

71
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,689
Anything else?

72
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,698
No, nothing

73
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,437
Thank you, Sir

74
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:10,620
Sir, there's this one thing...

75
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,354
Since the Chief has passed away

76
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,754
I felt obliged to let you know

77
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:21,430
about the scandal of cheating
at the last open bidding

78
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,132
The late Chief
shouldn't be held responsible

79
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,931
It was Jing

80
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,506
Why wasrt I informed before?

81
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,648
Jing's my good friend

82
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,445
I shouldn't have said anything

83
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,677
Ridiculous!

84
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:43,150
One shouldn't protect a friend

85
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:47,960
when a dead man has to shoulder
the blame to his grave.

86
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,860
That exactly how I feel

87
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,089
I'll look into this right away

88
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:58,704
Oh... please take care of
the late Chief's workload

89
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:02,936
You'll be acting Chief for now

90
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,067
Yes... of course

91
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,403
Thank you, sir

92
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,988
Do you need someone
to teach you a lesson?

93
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,455
Why don't you leave?
Just like your father!

94
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:36,729
And don't come back!

95
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,445
You've changed...

96
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,612
A lot

97
00:15:55,988 --> 00:16:01,449
No. I'm not sure about that

98
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:05,419
Why don't you come work for me?

99
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,264
Am I qualified?

100
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:14,266
Qualified or not, I want you

101
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,275
I still remember how good you were

102
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,410
If not you, then who?

103
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,679
That was a long time ago

104
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,714
I haven't worked for years

105
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,793
You've been writing since then?

106
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:41,293
After 3 years,
this is all I've got to show for it

107
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:47,873
I know this book

108
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:51,331
I also know that
I was in one of your short stories

109
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,019
Shen got divorced

110
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,060
He left his old job

111
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,997
and came out on his own

112
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,064
I went to his new office today

113
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,137
He asked me to go work for him

114
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,104
He even said it's really a waste

115
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,978
to have someone like me at home

116
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,682
It might not be a bad idea

117
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:22,284
It's always nice
to have jobs come to you for a change

118
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,234
I'm about to become Section Chief

119
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,903
What about Jing?

120
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,235
He got himself in trouble

121
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,712
Some big, big trouble

122
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,432
Fucking bitch!

123
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,969
What the...? You're still alive?

124
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,665
You're the only one that got away?

125
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,076
Heard it was the landlord who snitched

126
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,381
Old Y's too much

127
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,183
running tables
without giving the landlord a piece

128
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:54,584
Didrt even pay rent!

129
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,982
Of course you can't find them

130
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,126
They've all split town

131
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,321
Some have gone down south

132
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,220
Shun? Shurs in the slammer

133
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,426
Old Y's put away for life

134
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,763
Are you looking to hide out?

135
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,097
Come over here then

136
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,569
Crowded places are the best

137
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:19,840
Let me tell you

138
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,641
the more crowded a place
is the safer it is

139
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,948
Don't you get it, dummy?

140
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:18,134
It is now 11:31 and 10 seconds

141
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,742
It is now 11:31 and 20 seconds

142
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:34,215
It is now...

143
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:22,326
No, you made a mistake!

144
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,428
Well, this is the right address

145
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,038
the girl on the phone said

146
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,529
You need 50 lunches and said
you're filming a movie here

147
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,835
Does it look to you
like we are filming a movie?

148
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:34,774
Take them away!

149
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,471
Get out of here!

150
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,578
Movies my ass...

151
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:50,222
Young man, looking for a flat?

152
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,420
Come, I'll let you rent it cheap

153
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:53,723
No

154
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,824
What do you mean, no?
Then what are you here for?

155
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,059
Checking the meters?

156
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,569
Fuck, ever since the shoot out

157
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,608
no one wanted to rent this flat

158
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:04,776
Damn

159
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:07,312
people even started
playing jokes on me

160
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,013
3 fire trucks came last night

161
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,105
said this place is on fire

162
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,877
When will this end, goddamn it!

163
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,467
It's too late

164
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,534
You're the only one that cared

165
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,641
I'm so hurt, so very hurt...

166
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,912
I don't want to live anymore!

167
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:25,320
I've already taken
a bottle of sleeping pills

168
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:30,016
I am notjoking, I don't want to live

169
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,763
There's no sense in living

170
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,163
There's no point

171
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:43,965
Thank you... Good bye

172
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,032
Hello, give me Dick!

173
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,709
Don't give me shit

174
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,244
If you don't get him

175
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,212
I'll break both your legs!

176
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,455
I don't know what to do anymore

177
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:37,350
You know, at first

178
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:40,559
I counted on some writing skills

179
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,765
some real-life experiences

180
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:46,166
whether they happened to me
to my friends

181
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:51,774
Characters, plots, that I heard about

182
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:55,176
I jotted them down in my notebook

183
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:01,516
But it's become so meaningless
to write this way

184
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:15,832
I feel I've used up of my emotions

185
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,831
My past 30 years

186
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:22,234
I've used up it all so quickly

187
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:32,850
Now I only know how to write
about things between man and wife

188
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:37,445
I can't think of anything else

189
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:40,747
Because my world
has become smaller and smaller

190
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,359
Do you understand?

191
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:52,200
I don't know how others see your work

192
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,604
When I read your stories

193
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,134
I want to see you

194
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:06,182
The you in the past

195
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,548
We become youthful again

196
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,297
These things do not fade with time

197
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,376
I've always had faith in you

198
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,212
What are you thinking about?

199
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,380
Nothing

200
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:24,922
Does Li Jong know about our past?

201
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,034
You've never mentioned to him
about your past relationships?

202
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,173
He has never asked me

203
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,746
Then he really trusts you

204
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,111
Yes

205
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,141
No, that's not it

206
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,756
What I mean is

207
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,587
That's not trust...

208
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,288
He never seemed to have cared

209
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,367
You've got me all confused.

210
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:11,037
Your ex-wife, what was she like?

211
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:15,613
I didn't realize

212
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,605
how hard it was for you
to take my sudden wedding announcement

213
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:25,485
until I read that story of yours

214
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:34,261
It gave me a deep sense of guilt

215
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:44,506
Novels are novels.
Don't take it too seriously

216
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:49,073
No need to confuse it with reality

217
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:16,603
I'm going now

218
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,878
Better find someone else
to work for you

219
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:26,476
Don't waste your time on me

220
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,619
I have nothing to do
with the open bidding

221
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,733
Listen, I've been to Personnel Office
yesterday

222
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,302
The director has told me all about it!

223
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,827
He just told me that...

224
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,335
Keep your mouth shut!

225
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:50,939
Listen to me

226
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,675
You, be careful!

227
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,053
Shit, I quit!

228
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,459
I'm leaving today

229
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,956
They put me under investigation

230
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,534
They said I cheated

231
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,627
on the last open bidding.

232
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,964
I don't even know the date
when the bidding took place

233
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,048
Now that the Chief's dead

234
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,317
who knows what actually happened?

235
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:35,148
It must be that punk kid who framed me

236
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:38,514
Besides you, he's the only one
that knows the details of it

237
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:41,182
You think so?

238
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,228
Director is holding me responsible

239
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:46,458
Shit. Just because the chief died.

240
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,499
Doesrt mean he was perfect

241
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,098
I'm not going to be the scapegoat!

242
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,588
What... you're smoking again?

243
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,925
Didrt you quit?

244
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:50,415
It's OK.

245
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,585
Take it easy.

246
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,055
You can always rewrite it tomorrow

247
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,705
You haven't been drafted yet?

248
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,370
So where have you been hiding?

249
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:19,678
The whole world's been here
looking for you

250
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,019
Your girlfriend was here

251
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:24,510
Your old man was asking for you too

252
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,380
Well, not bad, huh?

253
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:29,890
I told you it was won'th the trip

254
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:33,394
My stuff is the best in town

255
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:40,335
I've no money, bill my old man

256
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,905
Come on, your old man told me

257
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:45,734
he's not going to pay your bills

258
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,633
Hello

259
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,373
He's gone to work. Who's this?

260
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,821
Yes, I'm his wife...

261
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:12,957
Who are you?

262
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,459
So he's not home.

263
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:20,129
I have something urgent
to talk to him about

264
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:23,633
Actually maybe
it's better if I talk to you directly

265
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:30,808
There's something to be settled

266
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:34,811
Could we... could we meet?

267
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:37,144
Name a place, and I'll be there

268
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,299
Hello

269
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,752
Hello

270
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:52,722
Oh... it's you

271
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:41,254
How come the study is so messy?

272
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,902
Where's Li-Jong?

273
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:29,379
I haven't seen him for 2 or 3 days

274
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:31,847
He might have taken leave

275
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:54,901
Sir, someone's here to see you

276
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:03,747
You piece of shit

277
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:04,815
Where have you been hiding?

278
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,442
How long has it been?

279
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:11,652
My wife hasn't been home for 3 days

280
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,981
Have you asked her friends?

281
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,023
I don't want people to know

282
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:20,028
Not even her family

283
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,402
What can I do?

284
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,904
Unless it's a kidnapping

285
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,667
or something how can I be of help?

286
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:33,911
Has there been anything

287
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:37,472
unusual about her recently?
For instance...

288
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,949
Besides being unappy with her writing

289
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:45,181
Nothing really unusual

290
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,794
Editor's not in until 6 or 7
There's no one at the newspaper

291
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:09,273
Speaking

292
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:28,592
It was the editor

293
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:31,663
He said he talked to her

294
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:35,501
Said she may be somewhere
finishing her novel,

295
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:37,836
maybe she needs quiet to concentrate

296
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,610
I feel much better now

297
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,346
She'll be back in a few days

298
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:51,554
A while back, she wanted a child

299
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:53,781
It didn't work out.

300
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:57,226
She was quite depressed

301
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:00,623
and started writing all day

302
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:02,562
I went along with it

303
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:07,966
Lately, she seems
to have grown a bit restless again

304
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:16,944
No one believed she'd marry you

305
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,483
I guess it must be my fault

306
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,253
I knew she likes fancy things

307
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:31,055
And a more comfortable lifestyle

308
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:37,034
Luckily, I'm about to be promoted
to Section Chief

309
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,093
Maybe it will help the situation

310
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,233
We'll see

311
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:49,974
Buddy, you need to call more often

312
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,248
Come by only when you need help

313
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:54,081
What am I to you?

314
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:07,022
You're home

315
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,094
How come you left without a word

316
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:18,564
not even a phone number

317
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:23,306
Did you finish it?

318
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:26,565
Just at the deadline

319
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:30,642
What are your chances of winning?

320
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:34,684
I'm happy enough

321
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:37,217
just to have finished it

322
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,348
We can clean up this mess finally.

323
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:16,449
I wouldn't dare touch it
while you werert here

324
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:34,411
No need to bother.
All I need is a few books

325
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:37,676
Doesrt it bother you,
looking at this mess?

326
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:56,928
I'm moving out

327
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:59,958
I've already found a place

328
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:04,506
I'm moving out tonight

329
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:16,943
I need new surroundings

330
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,813
A change of lifestyle

331
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:25,491
I've already started working

332
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:29,592
I've given up writing

333
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:32,430
I'm not the type to begin with

334
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:51,655
If it was going to be like this

335
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:54,920
why bother giving up such a good job

336
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:58,193
to stay home
and write in the first place

337
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:04,067
What have I done wrong?

338
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:05,864
I have always gone along
with your decisions

339
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:06,870
Look at this house

340
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:09,395
Every bit and piece you chose

341
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,749
Say something!

342
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:30,993
Talk to me!

343
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:35,056
What is the matter with you lately?

344
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:39,235
If you know it was going
to end up like this

345
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:41,135
why did you bother?

346
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:47,004
When we got married
you promised to give up writing

347
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:53,742
Who knows what got into you

348
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:56,611
First you quit yourjob

349
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,155
then locked yourself into writing

350
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:00,790
It was driving me up the wall!

351
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,492
I'll tell you I wouldn't even dare

352
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:04,585
to take one step
inside that study of yours!

353
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,835
You know,

354
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:22,107
if it wasrt for the baby

355
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:25,178
This would have happened long ago

356
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:31,378
I was so sick and tired of my job

357
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:35,022
I was afraid that
my whole life would pass by like that

358
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:46,069
You know,

359
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,469
when I locked myself in the study

360
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:53,306
Thinking up those pretty lines

361
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:57,642
It was to forget
those painful memories

362
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:01,214
to forget about the lost baby

363
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,499
If you don't understand by now

364
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,333
You'll never understand!

365
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:34,672
Every time,
you misunderstand me or blame me

366
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:40,781
Maybe I wasrt fair to you

367
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:46,653
but I know what kind of life I need

368
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,294
When we got married

369
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,931
I thought it would be a new start

370
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:58,201
To try and have a baby

371
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:00,635
was also a new start

372
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,874
To try writing again

373
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,705
Was yet another new start

374
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,385
Leaving you now

375
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,821
Is also a new start

376
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:29,165
What good is all this?

377
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:30,966
Do you understand?

378
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,240
All you know are those routines

379
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:41,441
Repetitions, day in, day out,

380
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:45,712
Do you know why I lock myself
in there all day?

381
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:50,826
It's the only way to hide from it!

382
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:58,059
Do you understand? You don't!

383
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:02,305
This is the biggest difference
between you and me

384
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:04,967
This is why...

385
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:32,792
Remember that day when
cops were busting up this place?

386
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:37,128
I saw you leap from the balcony

387
01:09:39,108 --> 01:09:41,668
I called the ambulance for you

388
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:51,682
Later, when I went to the hospital.
You had already left

389
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:02,829
So you were the one

390
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:05,058
Who sent those fire trucks, lunches...

391
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:08,760
And the young housewife...

392
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:12,932
Is it really fun to play tricks
on others like this?

393
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:17,346
Is it really fun
to take pictures of others?

394
01:10:17,346 --> 01:10:19,007
Hey, what I do is serious stuff!

395
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:22,342
The guy at the physical said
I have perfect eyesight

396
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:25,279
Once I serve the army,
I'd make top grade marksman

397
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:30,756
I've a friend who was a loudmouth

398
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:33,989
Later he became popular singer

399
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:38,326
I suppose
I'll become a photographer one day

400
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:51,045
This is a darkroom

401
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:55,042
How many days have I been here?

402
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:57,515
I've no idea

403
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,685
Is it day or night out there?

404
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:04,081
I don't know

405
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:08,058
I bet it must be daytime.

406
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:11,296
Want to bet?

407
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:22,071
You lost

408
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:51,965
I'll bring your pictures with me
to the army

409
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:55,340
I'll write you everyday

410
01:11:56,145 --> 01:12:00,309
Stay with me. Wait for me

411
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:26,172
Going to Kaohsiung?
What are you going to do there?

412
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:32,576
3,000 dollars

413
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:39,121
Take it or leave it

414
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:41,521
3,000 dollars, take it or leave it?

415
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:50,194
It's plenty for you
to spend in Kaohsiung

416
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:53,961
It's plenty for you
to spend in Kaohsiung

417
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:58,264
You want to play tough?
If you play tough, it's 2,000!

418
01:12:58,607 --> 01:13:01,440
If you play tough, it's 2,000

419
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,818
Say something!

420
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:13,422
Don'tjust stare!

421
01:13:13,422 --> 01:13:16,391
Don't try to play tough.
Big Shun is now locked up!

422
01:13:16,592 --> 01:13:19,117
Say something. Don't forget,
Big Shun is now...

423
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:25,063
I heard Shun got out ofjail

424
01:15:49,177 --> 01:15:51,168
Young master, you've come back

425
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:54,078
I'm broke. Where else can I go?

426
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:16,604
This came a few days ago

427
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:42,520
[Draft Notice]

428
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,565
I've heard you're having troubles
at home lately. Is that true?

429
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:27,198
No, it was nothing...

430
01:17:27,275 --> 01:17:28,742
Really?

431
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:31,213
I also heard your wife left you.
Is that true?

432
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:32,080
No,

433
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,571
she needs a lot of peace and quiet

434
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:37,185
She needs concentration for her work

435
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:39,813
She's a writer, you know. Novels...

436
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:42,719
What does she usually write about?

437
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,661
I'm not sure

438
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:48,289
I never read novels

439
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,638
Hello?

440
01:18:36,945 --> 01:18:38,913
The editor was just on the phone

441
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:42,743
said the Writer's Award
has been announced.

442
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:47,614
I've won First Prize

443
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:57,258
Gee, does this mean
you'll switch professions again?

444
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:07,309
First I thought for me

445
01:19:07,309 --> 01:19:10,608
to become a good novelist
was impossible

446
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:17,152
I was almost going to give up

447
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:22,681
The story is about an ordinary couple

448
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:28,330
then there is a crank call

449
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:30,628
The wife only hears

450
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:32,167
the voice of this woman

451
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:35,270
without being able
to see her in person

452
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:38,103
I was trying hard to explore
some new approach

453
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:40,208
I guess I was influenced
by Japanese suspense literature

454
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:47,349
Try to write in a honest and sincere way...

455
01:19:47,349 --> 01:19:51,911
I've seen this face before,
I know I have!

456
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:56,458
Oh, her!
She won First Prize with this novel.

457
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:58,756
Not bad.

458
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:02,755
So... she's a writer

459
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:08,427
"Notes from a Marriage"
What's it about?

460
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:12,263
It's about a couple

461
01:20:12,674 --> 01:20:14,409
they have some problems

462
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:16,172
not that happy together

463
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:19,111
Then the wife gets a call
from the husband's mistress...

464
01:20:19,347 --> 01:20:22,077
It gets painful...
Everything changes...

465
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:25,420
The husband can't figure out
what happened...

466
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:27,285
He's under a lot of pressure

467
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:29,717
goes nuts and murders his wife

468
01:20:29,791 --> 01:20:31,782
before killing himself

469
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:33,885
Ends everyone's torture

470
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:36,097
One member of the jury said

471
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:38,224
The story is so real

472
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,598
and suspenseful

473
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:43,499
that it sends chills up your spine

474
01:20:45,707 --> 01:20:47,641
It was completely unexpected

475
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:54,414
So... now...
Do you think you'll move home?

476
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:06,194
I just can't figure this out

477
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:08,594
We now both are doing well
in our careers.

478
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:09,197
Why is...

479
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:12,564
I've said all I had to say...

480
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:16,403
and you still don't understand

481
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:21,138
Let's not waste
each other's time anymore

482
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,085
I don't mean to hurt you

483
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:35,789
This you must understand

484
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:48,770
It's only a novel!

485
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:51,102
And you're letting it consume you!

486
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,442
It's terrible!

487
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:04,478
And I'm the only one on earth
that knows what actually happened!

488
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:09,386
Novels are fiction. They aren't real!

489
01:22:09,824 --> 01:22:12,315
So now you know novels aren't real

490
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:15,562
So, what do you think you can do?

491
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:23,632
O. K...

492
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:29,911
No one's at the newspaper

493
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:31,776
They don't open till 6 to 7

494
01:22:59,441 --> 01:23:00,942
Still no answer

495
01:23:00,942 --> 01:23:01,810
Let's go

496
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:04,779
Don't get involved

497
01:24:03,571 --> 01:24:04,868
Hello?

498
01:24:05,473 --> 01:24:07,338
She's not in

499
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:09,443
Who is this?

500
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:13,948
Who are you?

501
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:26,352
Name a place, I'll be there

502
01:25:13,174 --> 01:25:14,576
Are you tied up?

503
01:25:14,576 --> 01:25:16,476
What's up? Excuse me a minute.

504
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:25,917
Have you been seen these two before?

505
01:25:26,054 --> 01:25:28,852
Sure, I know him well.
They call him Shun in the streets

506
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,393
and this here Eurasian girl
is his woman...

507
01:25:32,393 --> 01:25:34,725
They call her the White Chick

508
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,826
What about them?
Where did you get these?

509
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:40,996
A young man called up

510
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:43,299
said we should meet immediately

511
01:25:43,771 --> 01:25:47,036
He said the White Chick had something
to do with my wife leaving me

512
01:25:47,775 --> 01:25:50,512
He said it's all in this novel

513
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:52,180
Novel? What novel?

514
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:53,909
This one here Itjust won First Prize

515
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:55,813
I haven't read it.

516
01:25:57,685 --> 01:25:59,585
No kidding.

517
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:04,058
Let me finish with the novel first.

518
01:26:04,058 --> 01:26:04,683
You go ahead.

519
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:06,020
Have a seat.

520
01:26:29,651 --> 01:26:32,119
Do you know where to find
these two then?

521
01:27:39,687 --> 01:27:45,216
Mr. So-and-so... Exports Manager

522
01:27:46,527 --> 01:27:47,858
What is this?

523
01:27:48,062 --> 01:27:49,393
What is this?

524
01:27:50,965 --> 01:27:54,669
Don't you understand?

525
01:27:54,669 --> 01:27:57,536
She's my sister!
What were you going to do with her?

526
01:27:57,739 --> 01:27:59,374
You better wise up, man!

527
01:27:59,374 --> 01:28:01,569
She's under-aged.

528
01:28:01,709 --> 01:28:06,703
She's only 14!
Go ahead. Call the cops!

529
01:28:23,531 --> 01:28:25,499
You didn't tell me

530
01:28:25,733 --> 01:28:29,066
How would I know?

531
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:32,665
Things like this don't happen

532
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:36,675
It's that girl
who played the joke on you

533
01:28:39,847 --> 01:28:44,011
I've even found her for you

534
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:48,654
Here she is. Look at her!

535
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:14,881
Long time no see

536
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:18,277
I'm here to have a talk with her
to discuss a few things

537
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:22,247
Come in

538
01:29:24,292 --> 01:29:26,226
Wait for me in the conference room

539
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:16,866
Maybe that phone call
made me suspect you

540
01:30:17,211 --> 01:30:20,669
but that's not the point!
Don't you understand?

541
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:24,744
Novels are novels.

542
01:30:24,886 --> 01:30:26,788
Can't you tell fiction from reality?

543
01:30:26,788 --> 01:30:28,585
Shut up!

544
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:43,370
You're coming back with me!

545
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:45,463
Hey, cool it!

546
01:31:23,444 --> 01:31:25,241
Sorry, I'm late

547
01:31:25,346 --> 01:31:27,678
Got tied up on the way over

548
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:40,383
The director has just announced
his decision this morning

549
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:43,892
He picked me
to be the new section chief

550
01:32:05,887 --> 01:32:06,854
The director's not in

551
01:32:06,854 --> 01:32:09,948
I'll page you once he returns, O.K.?

552
01:32:10,658 --> 01:32:13,923
No, I'll just wait for him

553
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:35,550
He refuses to leave.
He insists to stay and wait

554
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:37,745
What're we going to do?

555
01:34:47,548 --> 01:34:50,142
When did you get here?

556
01:34:51,552 --> 01:34:53,782
I'm here to let you know

557
01:34:55,256 --> 01:34:59,660
the director made his decision

558
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:02,458
on who's going to be
the new Section Chief.

559
01:35:02,897 --> 01:35:05,297
He picked me.

560
01:35:06,267 --> 01:35:09,464
From now on,
I'm officially the Section Chief!

561
01:35:09,637 --> 01:35:11,730
That's great! You've been waiting
for this a long time

562
01:35:11,906 --> 01:35:16,104
It calls for a celebration.
Let's go have a drink

563
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:27,877
Boy, finally you're in a good mood

564
01:35:30,658 --> 01:35:35,357
I was real fortunate.
My superiors appreciated my hard work

565
01:35:38,265 --> 01:35:41,063
especially the director

566
01:35:41,535 --> 01:35:43,901
From now on, I'll work ever harder

567
01:35:44,572 --> 01:35:49,066
For a man, a successful career
is the most important thing

568
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:52,104
all the rest is meaningless

569
01:35:54,348 --> 01:35:55,716
So my wife left me...

570
01:35:55,716 --> 01:36:00,813
To hell with her. Who gives a shit?

571
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:06,426
For this, I was real lucky...

572
01:36:06,694 --> 01:36:11,825
Otherwise, wouldn't I be left up
the creek without a paddle?

573
01:36:15,336 --> 01:36:18,134
Less talk... Drink up

574
01:42:17,598 --> 01:42:20,192
Sir, about the wife's boyfriend

575
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,368
he's in stable condition

576
01:42:22,503 --> 01:42:24,232
after emergency surgery

577
01:42:24,438 --> 01:42:26,707
The wife is also at the hospital

578
01:42:26,707 --> 01:42:29,107
She's still in a state of shock

579
01:42:29,543 --> 01:42:31,111
You better cover the hospital

580
01:42:31,111 --> 01:42:33,102
I bet he's bound to show up

581
01:44:04,204 --> 01:44:08,971
Have we met somewhere before?

582
01:44:17,751 --> 01:44:18,979
You think so?

583
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,145
Damn

584
01:47:18,999 --> 01:47:20,432
What's wrong?
