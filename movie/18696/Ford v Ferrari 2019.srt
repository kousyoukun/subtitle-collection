19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,120
這里是1959年勒芒24小時耐力賽的現場直播
This is live coverage of the 1959 24 Hours of Le Mans.

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,580
比賽已經進行到了一半
We've reached the halfway point

21
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,040
到目前為止  我們目睹了由卡羅爾·謝爾比駕駛的
and so far witnessed Aston Martin number 5,

22
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,710
阿斯頓馬丁5號
driven by Carroll Shelby,

23
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,030
在過去的一小時里增加了大量行駛里程
making great gains in the last hour.

24
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:06,630
如果他繼續保持當前的速度
If he keeps this pace up,

25
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,060
{\an8}{\pos(192,106.4)}極速車王

26
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,610
他就有可能贏得...
he could have a chance at the...

27
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,810
{\an8}燃油

28
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,880
他要進站了
He's coming in.

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,230
他要進站了  快點  行動起來
He's coming in. Let's go, let's go.

30
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,110
-拿輪胎  -快點  行動起來
- Tires! - Let's go, let's go.

31
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,490
我知道你們累了  加把勁  速戰速決
I know you're tired, but come on, let's make this fast.

32
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,970
動起來  動起來  快
Move, move, move!

33
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,770
它有點過熱  但沒什么大問題
She's running a little hot, but we're good.

34
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,990
輪胎還有抓地力
Tires are still gripping.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,580
-著火了  -油點著了
- Fire! - The fuel! Fire!

36
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,360
-謝爾比  你著火了  - 把那條毯子拿來
- Shelby, it's you! - Grab that blanket!

37
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,280
放開我  放開
Get off me! Off!

38
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,820
你還好嗎
You okay?

39
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,780
給油箱加油啊
Fill the tank!

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,620
-謝爾比  你剛剛...  -我身上著火了嗎
- Shelby, you just... - Am I on fire?

41
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,060
我他媽身上著火了嗎
Am I on goddamn fire?

42
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,770
-你沒著火  -那就趕快給油箱加油
- No, you're not on fire. - Fill the damn tank!

43
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,930
-加油  -加油
- Fill the tank. - Fill the tank.

44
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,040
準備好
Get it ready!

45
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,270
-我現在在什么位置  艾迪  -領先兩圈
- Where am I, Eddie? - Two laps up, my friend.

46
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,260
車準備好了
Car's yours.

47
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,510
上吧
Go get 'em.

48
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,880
由卡羅爾·謝爾比駕駛的阿斯頓馬丁5號
Aston Martin number 5, driven by Carroll Shelby,

49
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,180
在比賽將要結束時
has maintained his lead

50
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,510
保持了領先地位
as we're nearing the final minutes of the race.

51
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,370
謝爾比
Shelby.

52
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,460
方格旗已經出現了
The checkered flag is out.

53
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,040
觀眾們翹首以盼
The crowd are on their feet.

54
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,850
謝爾比
Shelby.

55
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,140
贏得了冠軍
takes the title!

56
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,940
一個美國人贏了勒芒耐力賽
An American wins Le Mans.

57
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,840
謝爾比
Shelby.

58
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,400
卡羅爾·謝爾比
Carroll Shelby.

59
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,130
什么
What?

60
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,900
這事你不能再無視下去了
This is something you can't ignore anymore.

61
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,140
我吃藥啊  藥片有用的
Oh, I take the pills. The pills work.

62
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,200
過快的心率  比如每分鐘130下
An elevated heart rate, say 130 BPM,

63
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,660
即使持續時間很短
sustained even for a short period,

64
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,410
你也很有可能會心跳驟停
you run a critical risk of cardiac arrest.

65
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,790
-那我就開一些短程比賽  -那樣也沒用
- I'll race shorter format then. - That's not gonna work.

66
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,630
我可以開納斯卡車賽  F1錦標賽
Well, I could race NASCAR. Formula One.

67
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,740
你的心臟瓣膜撐不住了  謝爾比
The valve is shot, Shelby.

68
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,420
這件事很嚴重
This is as serious as it gets.

69
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,160
在我看來  你今天能坐在這里就已經是萬幸了
In my opinion, you're lucky to be sitting here today.

70
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,410
我確實覺得自己很幸運
Well, I feel real lucky.

71
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,170
我覺得我是全世界最幸運的人
Luckiest guy on earth.

72
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,470
在七千轉時
There's a point.

73
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,320
有一個臨界點  一切都變得虛無
7,000 RPM where everything fades.

74
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,910
車失去了重量
The machine becomes weightless.

75
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,740
直接消失了
Just disappears.

76
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,670
當心點  伙計
Watch it, buddy!

77
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,050
只留下一具軀殼
And all that's left is a body

78
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,090
在時空中穿梭
moving through space and time.

79
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,970
七千轉
7,000 RPM.

80
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,190
就是那個臨界點
That's where you meet it.

81
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,360
它會向你提出一個問題
It asks you a question.

82
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,440
一個終極的問題
The only question that matters.

83
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,530
"你究竟是誰"
"Who are you?"

84
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,060
現在駕駛法拉利的是馮·特里普斯
Now, it's von Trips in the Ferrari,

85
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,310
他來到了下坡急彎
coming into the corkscrew.

86
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,980
{\an8}我給你打了三次電話  你一次都沒回我
Hey, I called you three times, and you never answer the phone.

87
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,500
他在延遲剎車
He's braking late.

88
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,270
他創造了新的圈速紀錄
Oh! He sets a new lap record!

89
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,690
{\an8}每個電話我都會接
I answer the phone every time it rings.

90
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,650
{\an8}不  先生  你沒接
No, sir, you do not.

91
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,690
我接了
Yes, I do.

92
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,860
不  你沒接
No, you don't.

93
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,970
一個月前  這輛車還好好的
A month ago, this car was fine.

94
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,740
現在都沒法發動了
Now, it won't even start.

95
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,680
每次一發動  就砰砰作響
And when it does, it's, "Boom, boom, boom!"

96
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,700
我把這車開出車道
When I pull out of the driveway,

97
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,650
路旁的狗都要嚇出心臟病
the dog has a heart attack.

98
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,730
我只希望你能把這車修好
All I'm asking is for you to make it like it was.

99
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,090
你把進氣閥和火花塞憋住了
Yeah, you've coked up the inlet valves and the plugs.

100
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,340
車沒問題
Nothing wrong with the car,

101
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,460
有問題的是開車方式
just the way it's being driven.

102
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,630
開車方式
The way it's being driven?

103
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,710
燃料太多  火星不夠
Too much fuel, not enough spark.

104
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,970
所以它才會打不著火
That's what's making her misfire.

105
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,620
你想用人話跟我解釋一遍嗎
You wanna run that by me in English?

106
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,040
好吧  先生
All right, sir.

107
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,420
你看啊
So...

108
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,640
那邊那輛車  是輛跑車
that there, that is a sport car.

109
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,850
你必須用開跑車的方法來開她
You have to drive her like a sport car.

110
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,650
如果你像個學校老師一樣來開她
If you drive her like a school teacher,

111
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,110
它就會堵塞  知道嗎
she'll clog up. All right?

112
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,470
等五千轉的時候再換擋  別兩千轉就換
Try changing up at 5,000 RPM, not two.

113
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,770
開車的時候認真點  干脆利落
Drive like you mean it. Hard and tight.

114
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,180
它就會順暢無阻了
She'll run clean.

115
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,850
你是在跟我說我不知道怎么開自己的車嗎
Are you telling me I don't know how to drive my own car?

116
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,110
不是
No.

117
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,380
但如果你問我的話  你確實駕馭不了這車
But if you ask me, this isn't your car.

118
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,320
普利茅斯或者斯圖貝克這種車更適合你
Your car's more a Plymouth or a Studebaker.

119
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,660
你是對我有什么意見嗎  伙計
You and me have a problem, buddy?

120
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,180
我沒有意見  我曾經有輛名爵
I don't have a problem. I had an MG.

121
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,700
我的車開著就挺好
Mine ran just fine.

122
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,600
去你的  你這個狗屁英國佬
Screw you, you limey prick.

123
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
我要退款
I want my money back.

124
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,330
文明一點  退給你就是了
Oh, behave. I'd give it to ya.

125
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,230
但你上個月的保養費還沒給呢
But you haven't paid for last month's service yet.

126
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,920
在這個國家  顧客就是上帝
This country, the customer's always right.

127
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,980
你沒聽說過嗎
You ever hear that?

128
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,090
聽過  聽過
Yeah. Yeah.

129
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,090
完全就是屁話
Utter nonsense.

130
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,700
記好了  我把定時鏈調快了
Now remember, I advanced the timing,

131
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,100
所以剛開始車會有點抖
so a smidge twitchy in first.

132
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,980
把轉速提上去  就這樣  轉速提上去
Get the revs up. Good lad. Revs up.

133
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,400
再見
Ta-ra.

134
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,030
又是一個滿意而歸的顧客嗎
Another satisfied customer?

135
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,200
何事需要效勞  小姐
Can I help you, miss?

136
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,580
剛剛那輛不是名爵的MGA 1500嗎
Wasn't that an MGA 1500?

137
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,910
你很懂車嘛
You know your cars.

138
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,250
我很喜歡車
Well, I like them.

139
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,330
我喜歡發動機的轟鳴聲
I love the sound they make.

140
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,380
那聲音直接穿過你的身體
The way it goes right through you.

141
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,750
沒錯
Right.

142
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,050
那種振動
That vibration.

143
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,950
我的車是那輛鑲木板的
Mine's the wood-paneled

144
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,850
福特鄉紳
Country Squire...

145
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,770
就停在街對面
across the street.

146
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,160
一輛改裝的大馬力車
A real hot rod.

147
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,190
是嗎
Oh, yeah?

148
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,150
-開得快嗎  -非常快
- Is it fast? - Very.

149
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,360
等等  你是哪種女孩
Wait a second. What type of girl are ya?

150
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,320
我這種女孩喜歡聞汽油味
Type of girl who likes the smell of wet gasoline.

151
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,420
和燒過的橡膠味
Burnt rubber.

152
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,740
那你有點離經叛道  不是嗎
Oh, what, are you some kind of a deviant, are ya?

153
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,990
還不是因為我嫁給了你
Well, only since I married you.

154
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,480
加爾  怎么回事
Hey, Gar, what's going on?

155
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,550
出事了
Something's up.

156
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:42,860
你好  李

157
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,430
聽著  銀行這事他沒你確定
Listen, he isn't as sure as you are about the banks.

158
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,510
我也不確定這事...
I'm not as sure about this...

159
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,680
進展如何
How's this going out?

160
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,150
-唐  怎么回事  -我不知道
- Don, what's going on? - I don't know.

161
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,080
福特先生  歡迎來到車間

全部停下
All stop.

167
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,310
聽見那聲音了嗎
Hear that?

168
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,480
那就是福特汽車公司
That's the sound of the Ford Motor Company...

169
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,820
要倒閉的聲音
out of business.

170
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:56,000
1899年  我的祖父亨利·福特
In 1899, my grandfather, Henry, by God, Ford...

171
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,600
從愛迪生照明公司走回家
was walking home from Edison Illumination

172
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,880
他那時剛上完兩輪班
after working a double shift.

173
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,710
他左思右想
He was ruminating.

174
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,940
那個清晨  他產生了一個想法
That morning, he had himself an idea

175
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,840
那個想法改變了世界

176
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,450
65年過去了
Sixty-five years

177
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,820
在生產了四千七百萬輛車之后
and 47 million automobiles later,

178
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,230
他將留下什么
what shall be his legacy?

179
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,940
雪佛蘭羚羊排出的尾氣
Getting it in the tail pipe from a Chevy Impala.

走回家
Walk home.

183
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:38,370
你們在走的時候  我希望你們能好好思索
While you're walking, I want you to ruminate.

184
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,750
誰能帶著想法走進我的辦公室
Man comes to my office with an idea,

185
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,420
誰就能保住工作
that man keeps his job.

186
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,340
其他的二流失敗者...
Rest of you second-best losers...

187
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,300
就待在家里吧
stay home.

188
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,470
你不屬于福特公司
You don't belong at Ford.

189
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,480
謝爾比

謝爾比在嗎
Is Shelby here?

201
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,180
很難說
it's touch and go.

202
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,370
謝爾比  你起得可真早
Shelby, you're up bright and early.

203
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,650
早起的鳥兒有蟲吃嘛  老爹
Well, early bird gets the worm, Pops.

204
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,380
好吧  你擔心誰
All right, who you worried about?

205
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,380
瑞德·法里斯和比爾·拉什頓
Well, you got Red Faris and Bill Rushton.

206
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,970
他們都開327發動機的
They're all in 327s.

207
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,590
科爾維特  那邦杜蘭特呢
Corvettes. What about Bondurant?

208
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,390
邦杜蘭特嗎  他還在給...
Bondurant? Well, he's still driving...

209
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,500
-謝爾比先生  能給我簽個名嗎  -沃什伯恩開車
- Mr. Shelby, can I get an autograph? - for Washburn.

210
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,000
614號
Number 614.

211
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,400
-太感謝了  -好了  放輕松
- Thank you so much. - All right, just relax. All right.

212
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,380
科爾維特那些車都不足掛齒
We're gonna eat those Vettes for breakfast.

213
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,880
我們更輕  更快
We're lighter, we're faster,

214
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,840
如果這些都沒用的話  我們更野
and that don't work, we're nastier.

215
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,320
各位爸爸們  在比賽開始之前
Hey, Dad, before the race starts,

216
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,360
帶著你們的兒子來柳泉賽道看看吧...
take your son over to the Willow Springs...

217
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,230
菲爾  今天對我們手下留點情  老兄
Hey, Phil. Hey, take it easy on us today, bud.

218
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,560
有什么問題嗎
You all right?

219
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,880
美國賽車俱樂部標準第2b節第15.4條
Paragraph 15.4, section 2b of the SCCA standard

220
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,170
規定了所有AF級賽車的后備箱容量
dictates all AF class cars must have

221
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,120
尺寸至少要長20英寸  寬12英寸  高6英寸
minimum trunk space of 20 inches by 12 inches by 6 inches.

222
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,080
你這車連后備箱都合不上
Your trunk doesn't close.

223
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,180
-因此這輛車不符合標準  -等等  什么
- Ergo car fails standard. - Wait, wait, wait. What?

224
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,360
因此這輛車沒有資格
Ergo car is disqualified from

225
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,970
-參加A級比賽  -不不不  聽著
- said Class A competition. - No, no, no. Look, look, look.

226
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,600
讓我問你個問題好嗎
Can I ask you a question, all right?

227
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,440
當你還是個小男孩的時候  你有沒有想過
When you were a little boy, did you think,

228
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,440
"等我長大了
"When I grow up,

229
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,810
我想去傳說中的柳泉賽道
I want to go to the fabled Willow Springs Raceway,

230
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,410
然后我想執行
and I want to enforce

231
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,610
美國賽車俱樂部標準第2b節第15.4條中
paragraph 15.4, section 2b

232
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,240
關于后備箱容量的規定"
of the SCCA regulations on luggage capacity"?

233
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,990
-好了  就這樣  -你想過嗎
- All right, that's it. - Did you?

234
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,230
我要取消你和你的隊伍的參賽資格
I'm ruling you and your team disqualified from this race.

235
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,790
這該不會是蘭斯·瑞文特羅吧
Well, if it isn't Lance Reventlow.

236
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,960
-謝爾比  -你最近怎么樣  蘭斯
- Shelby. - How you doing, Lance?

237
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,920
-老爹  -你好啊  蘭斯
- Pops. - Hey, Lance.

238
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,540
請允許我向你們介紹迪特·沃斯
Allow me to introduce Dieter Voss.

239
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,630
他在杰克遜維爾運營著布魯莫斯保時捷車隊
Runs Brumos Porsche out of Jacksonville.

240
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,670
久仰沃斯先生大名
Oh, I know all about Mr. Voss.

241
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,950
你可是用那輛阿巴斯在賽季取得了輝煌戰績啊  先生
You're having a hell of a season with that Abarth, sir.

242
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,470
-你那輛福特眼鏡蛇也是戰果累累  -多謝夸獎
- Seeing results for your Cobra, too. - Thank you.

243
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,970
你手下那個叫邁爾斯的挺不錯
Your guy Miles is impressive.

244
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,800
-你還在關注邁爾斯  -沒錯
- Oh, you following Miles? - Oh, yes.

245
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,560
他在1961年贏得了美國汽車俱樂部競速賽冠軍
Well, he was a USAC road racing champ in '61.

246
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,020
他贏下了派克峰登山賽
He won the Pikes Peak Hill Climb.

247
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,940
他連續三年贏得美國賽車俱樂部C級冠軍賽
He was SCCA C-class champion three years in a row

248
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,020
開的還是那輛他自己造的破名爵
in this piece-of-shit MG he built himself.

249
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,900
我們聽說他很難搞
We heard he's, difficult.

250
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,980
什么  肯嗎  不不  肯就是一只小狗狗
What, Ken? No, no. Ken's a puppy dog.

251
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,150
蘭斯  告訴他事實  你跟肯比賽過
Hey, Lance, tell the man. You've raced against Ken.

252
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,510
談不上比賽吧  幾乎都是我落后
Oh, I've driven more behind him than against him.

253
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,740
布魯莫斯正在找車手
Well, Brumos is looking for a driver

254
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,910
來駕駛我們在賽百靈耐力賽中的2號車
for our number two car at Sebring.

255
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,290
-是嗎  -這怎么可能
- Is that right? - How is that even possible?

256
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,290
你覺得你手下的邁爾斯可以嗎
Think your guy Miles can make the grade?

257
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,190
-肯這個人...  -他有沒有這么做  伙計
- Oh, well, Ken... - Is he, mate? Hey!

258
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,920
吉姆  他有沒有把他所有的行李
Jim! Is he putting his bloody carryal

259
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,380
-都放進你的后備箱  -什么
- in your trunk? - What?

260
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,630
這是可自由裁量的違規
Discretionary infraction.

261
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,160
各位  失陪一會
Gentlemen, excuse me a moment.

262
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,870
說實話  肯就是為了賽百靈耐力賽而生的
To be honest, Ken was born for Sebring.

263
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,350
這里面沒有哪句話規定了后備箱尺寸
Nothing in there about my trunk

264
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,180
也沒規定你那可愛的小行李箱的尺寸
and your lovely little portmanteau.

265
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,960
你拿的是1962年那版的老標準
You're holding the '62 edition of the SCCA.

266
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,260
你可以把這張該死的貼紙
And you can stick this bloody sticker

267
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,860
貼在見不得光的地方
where the sun don't shine.

268
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,110
比爾  有什么問題嗎  比爾
Hey, Bill. What seems to be the problem, Bill?

269
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,820
問題就是這位比爾是個混蛋
The problem is that Bill here is an arsehole.

270
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,160
-他不是真心的  -他就是真心的
- No, he doesn't mean that. - Oh, yes, he does. Yes, he does.

271
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,370
不  他真的覺得比爾就是個混蛋
No, he really does think that Bill is an arsehole.

272
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,660
-我只是在盡我的職責  -別急  比爾
- I'm just doing my job here. - Hang on. Bill, Bill, Bill.

273
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,870
依我的經驗看  肯定有...聽我說
In my experience, there is... Listen to me.

274
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,830
一般這種事  肯定有折中辦法
Something like this, there's always a middle ground.

275
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,920
-好嗎  肯是有點過分  -我只是在盡我的職責
- All right? Now, Ken's outta line. - And I'm just doing my job.

276
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,880
這我也理解
I understand you are.

277
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,090
你也知道他在比賽日的表現
You know how he gets on a race day.

278
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,170
你清楚的  不是嗎
You know that. All right?

279
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,990
你也沒必要因為一個后備箱就取消我們的比賽資格
But you're not gonna DQ us over a trunk.

280
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,420
-什么  -你看見那家伙了嗎
- What? - You see that guy?

281
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,170
興致勃勃的
Got his tail up.

282
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,970
高興了嗎  比爾
Happy, Bill?

283
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,360
比爾  我來處理吧  我來跟他談談
Bill, I'll handle it. I'll talk to him.

284
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,490
我來跟他談談  你就好好去享受今天吧
I'll talk to him. You just go and have a great day.

285
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,430
各位  餓了嗎
Hey, folks, feeling hungry?

286
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,390
那不妨去零食吧轉轉...
Head on over to the snack bar...

287
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,150
該死
Shit.

288
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,230
斗牛犬
Bulldog.

289
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,790
你知道剛剛我在跟誰談話嗎
You know who that was I was just talking to?

290
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,570
比爾
Bill.

291
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,110
-在那之前  -不知道
- Before that. - No.

292
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,160
是迪特·沃斯
It was Dieter Voss.

293
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,160
他是哪位
Who's that?

294
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,410
他運營著保時捷車隊  肯
He runs Porsche, Ken.

295
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,890
是個德國的小汽車公司  你或許有所耳聞
It's a little German car company. Maybe you heard of it.

296
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:28,600
好吧
All right.

297
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,220
他想讓你代表他們參加賽百靈耐力賽
He wanted you to drive at Sebring.

298
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,750
但他聽說你很難搞
But he'd heard you were difficult.

299
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:42,180
我還以為我們對德國人看法相同
I thought we felt the same way about, Germans.

300
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,430
你喜歡輸嗎  肯
Do you like losing, Ken?

301
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,730
你說什么
Excuse me?

302
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,810
你聽見了
Oh, you heard me.

303
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,060
我不會輸
I don't lose.

304
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,150
沒有贊助商  你就沒有車  肯
Without sponsors, you get no car, Ken.

305
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,250
據我所知  所有的職業賽車手
And last I checked, the professionals

306
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,880
-都有輛車  -謝爾
- all have a car. - Shel!

307
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,170
沒車你根本贏不了美國賽車俱樂部的比賽
You cannot win the SCCA without one.

308
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,090
如果你贏不了 那就是輸了
If you're not winning, you are losing.

309
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,550
別逼我用這玩意給你的腦門來一下
Don't make me lamp this at your head.

310
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,850
你大老遠地把你兒子帶來這里
Did you bring your son all the way out here

311
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,060
是為了讓他來看你被取消比賽資格
to watch you get disqualified

312
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,920
還是為了讓他見識你這副混蛋模樣
or just act like a jackass?

313
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,960
牛逼
Damn!

314
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,720
你身體力行地回答了這個問題
Well, that answers that.

315
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,530
彼得
Peter...

316
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,670
有什么事嗎  先生們
May I help you, gentlemen?

肯  你的擋風玻璃怎么了
Hey, Ken, what happened to your shield?

325
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,810
這是新設計
New design.

326
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,940
看來比賽即將開始

賽車已經完成了暖胎圈

綠旗已出
The green flag is out...

329
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,150
賽車正在接近起點線
and they're approaching the starting line.

330
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,950
來吧
Here we go.

331
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,330
該死的
Oh, bloody hell.

332
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,210
肯·邁爾斯目前處于落后位置
Ken Miles has fallen behind.

333
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,580
學學怎么開車吧  蠢貨
Learn to drive, you pillock!

334
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,090
謝爾比  你懷念這些嗎
So, Shelby, do you miss it?

335
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,590
你好啊  薩姆
Hey, Sam.

勒芒24小時耐力賽冠軍得主  忽然之間就退役了

337
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,930
開始賣車了

338
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,580
這說不通
It just don't make sense.

339
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,980
當然  除非謠言是真的
Well, unless the rumors are true, of course.

340
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,230
什么謠言  薩姆
Oh, what rumors would those be, Sam?

341
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,110
卡羅爾·謝爾比不開車了  因為他沒那個膽量了
That Carroll Shelby quit driving 'cause he lost his nerve.

342
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,620

350
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,290
馬上就要進入最后階段了

Number 18, Red Faris, is off the track.

353
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,920
所以目前丹·格尼領先
That leaves Dan Gurney for the lead

354
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,200
后面緊跟著經驗豐富的肯·邁爾斯

格尼能在最后的直道擋住他嗎

363
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,940

372
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,220
讓人意想不到

他雖然難搞  但車技不錯

大家請為這場精彩比賽中的每一位選手送上掌聲
Let's give everyone a hand for one heck of a race.

375

376
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,690
我去燒水
I'll put the kettle on.

377

384
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,570
出了什么事
What's wrong?

385
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,110
國稅局的人來了
The IRS came.

386
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,450
他們封了修車店
They've padlocked the garage.

387

00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,440
沒錯
Correct.

393
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,980
所以我得說清楚  我們破產了
So just to be clear, we are buggered.

395
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,950
什么都沒了嗎
As in totally?

396
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,710
可以說是分文不剩  身無長物
As in, not a bean, or a pot in which to piss.

397
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,810
備件  存貨  都沒了
Spares, stock, all gone.

398
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,340
工具  我的工具還都被鎖在了里面

我會想辦法解決的

1945年

我們的士兵們打完仗回了家
our soldiers came home.

403
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,640
他們回家做的第一件事是什么呢
What was the first thing that they did?

404
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,850
做愛
They had sex.

405
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,070
十七年后
Seventeen years later,

406
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,780
當年出生的那些嬰兒都長大了
those babies, they've grown.

407
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,320
他們找了工作

也考了駕照
They've got licenses.

409
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:02,380
但他們不想跟他們的父母一樣
But they do not wanna drive the same dull 50s cars

410
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,910
開著五十年代的老舊車型
that their parents drove.

411
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:07,100
如今的孩子  想讓自己有魅力

想讓自己有性吸引力
They want sex appeal.

413
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,000
想追求更快的速度
They want to go fast.

414
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,920
先生們

這只是地區性的  先生
It's... it's regional, sir.

420
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,120
如果你去看電影  或者翻開一本雜志
If you go to the movies, you open up a magazine,

421
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,620
你不會看到來自溫斯頓-塞勒姆的好男孩組合
you don't see good ol' boys from Winston-Salem.

422
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,730
你看見的都是...
You see...

423
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,360
索菲婭·羅蘭
Sophia Loren...

424
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,940
莫尼卡·維蒂
Monica Vitti.

425
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,120
007可不會開福特出任務  先生
James Bond does not drive a Ford, sir.

426
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,830
那是因為他是個敗類
That's because he's a degenerate.

427
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,910
沒錯吧
See?

428
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,830
天吶  我倒想做個敗類
God, I'd like to be a degenerate.

429
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,930
給我一點時間  先生
just give me one second here, sir.

430
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,040
這是你展示的一部分嗎
Is this part of it?

431
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:58,810
這有什么意義嗎  艾亞科卡
Is this going anywhere, Iacocca?

432
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,770
等等  先生
Just a second, sir.

433
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,150
好了  好了  可以了
All right, all right, that's enough.

434
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,030
先生  麻煩您再等我...
Sir, if you just bear with me...

435
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,550
關掉  開燈
Turn it off. Lights.

436
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,660
李  在過去的三年里
Lee, in the last three years,

437
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,060
在你和你的營銷團隊的帶領下
you and your marketing team...

438
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,190
公司經歷了美國史上最嚴重的銷量暴跌
have presided over the worst sales slump in US history.

439
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,950
福特先生到底為什么要聽你的
Why exactly should Mr. Ford listen to you?

440
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,030
因為一直以來我們都想錯了
Because we've been thinking wrong.

441
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,540
法拉利
Ferrari.

442
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,250
在最近五次勒芒賽中  法拉利贏了四次
Now, they have won four out of the last five Le Mans.

443
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,800
我們得像法拉利一樣思考
We need to think like Ferrari.

444
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,110
法拉利一年造的車
Ferrari makes fewer cars

445
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,470
還沒有我們一天造的多
in a year than we make in a day.

446
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,570
我們在廁紙上花的錢
We spend more on toilet paper

447
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:50,060
都比他們在生產上的全部投入要高
than they do on their entire output.

448
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,830
你還想讓我們像他們一樣思考
You want us to think like them?

449
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,990
恩佐·法拉利會名留青史
Enzo Ferrari will go down in history

450
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,440
被稱為史上最偉大的汽車制造者
as the greatest car manufacturer of all time.

451
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,570
為什么
Why?

452
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:04,030
是因為他造的車最多嗎
Is it because he built the most cars?

453
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,590
不
No.

454
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,930
而是因為他的車所蘊含的意義
It's because of what his cars mean.

455
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:11,940
勝利
Victory.

456
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,340
法拉利在勒芒賽上取勝了
Ferrari wins at Le Mans.

457
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:18,050
人們...他們想要分享這種勝利
People, they, they want some of that victory.

458
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,530
如果福特的標志意味著勝利呢
What if the Ford badge meant victory?

459
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:24,910
而且這種意味被重要的人群認可
And meant it where it counts,

460
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,610
也就是那群史上第一批兜里有錢的
with the first group of 17-year-olds in history

461
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,910
十七歲青少年
with money in their pockets?

462
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,290
這要花上好長時間
This would take years.

463
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,280
幾十年去測試和研發
Decades to test and develop...

464
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,680
還得有一個能打敗法拉利的賽車團隊
a race team capable of taking out Ferrari.

465
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,910
法拉利破產了
Ferrari's bankrupt.

466
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,210
恩佐把他賺到的每一分錢都花在追求完美上了
Enzo has spent every lira he's got chasing perfection,

467
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,370
而您猜怎么著
and you know something?

468
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,340
他做到了
He got there.

469
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,320
但如今他破產了
But now he's broke.

470
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:03,340
{\an8}扣押

471
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,430
你不必放棄賽車
You don't have to give up racing

472
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,880
去找一份正職  肯
to get a bloody day job, Ken.

473
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,620
我覺得有必要
I think I do.

474
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,010
我已經玩夠了
Now, I've had my fun.

475
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,530
是時候供養家庭
It's time to put food on the table...

476
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,250
成長起來了
and grow up.

477
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,920
修車店無法支撐我們支付賬單
The garage didn't pay the bills.

478
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,080
而且如今還被扣押了
Now it's locked up.

479
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,730
賽車同樣也不能幫我們付賬單
Racing doesn't pay them either,

480
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,910
更別說我還總是贏呢
and I keep winning.

481
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,090
對啊  因為你很厲害
Yeah, because you're good.

482
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:31,170
但我不太遵守規則
But I can't play the game.

483
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,590
我不是那種善于團隊合作的人
I'm not what they call a people person.

484
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,620
-這可不一定  -而且我已經45歲了
- You don't say. - And I'm 45 years old.

485
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,210
你真覺得我還會有所改變嗎
Do you really think I'm gonna change?

486
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:40,310
我永遠也不會有什么很好的發展了
I'm never gonna get the good rise.

487
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,350
我開始得太晚了
I started too late.

488
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,450
那是因為你參戰了
Because you fought in the bloody war.

489
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,670
如果你不賽車了  你會變得讓人難以忍受的
If you stop, you'll be bloody insufferable.

490
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,660
我們別再繞圈子了  已經結束了
Let's quit going round the Wrekin. It's over.

491
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,850
想想好的那面
Let's look on the bright side.

492
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,240
如今我可以養老享福
Now I can get fat and old,

493
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,720
養養玫瑰  吃吃豬肉派
trim the roses, and eat pork pies.

494
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:04,890
{\an8}法拉利

495
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,380
不好意思
Scusa.

496
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,270
拜托  不能拍照
Please, no photos.

497
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,040
拜托了
Prego.

498
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,510
-放松點  -你得理解
- Relax, will you? - You gotta understand.

499
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,760
這就像是黑手黨出現
This is like the Mafia showing up

500
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,470
要買走自由女神像
to buy the Statue of Liberty.

501
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,930
如今是反過來的
Kind of the opposite, actually.

502
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,430
如果媒體得到風聲  就要出大亂子了
The press gets wind of this, the shit will hit the Fangio.

503

Journalists?

不不  艾亞科卡先生  不是的
No, no, Mr. Iacocca, no.

那是我們的攝影師
It's our cameras.

508
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,730
只是為了見證歷史
Just for history.

509
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,840
4L科倫坡發動機
Four-liter Colombo engine.

510
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,350
每個發動機都由一個人獨立組裝完成
One man assembles the entire engine by himself.

511
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:02,270
變速器由另一個人組裝
Another man assembles the transmission.

512
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,420
一切都是手工制造
Everything hand-built.

513
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,460
太漂亮了
Bellissimo.

那位就是
That's him.

517
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:35,230
我們兩個公司合并后會形成兩個實體
This merger between our companies will form two entities.

518
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,780
福特-法拉利
Ford-Ferrari,

519
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,330
福特控股90%
90 percent owned by Ford,

520

第二  法拉利-福特  賽車團隊
Secondly, Ferrari-Ford, the race team,

522

法拉利控股90%
90 percent owned by Ferrari.

523
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,800
為了辦妥這事  福特將支付...
In order to secure this, Ford will pay the sum...

524
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,430

他需要一點時間來讀這份合同
He will need some time to read this.

請便

00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,230
{\an2}{\pos(192,245)}我餓了  我們去吃東西吧

563
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:59,050
{\an8}底特律獨立報
菲亞特收購法拉利
恩佐保留完全控制權  賽車部門保持獨立
福特遭拒絕

564
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,810
他耍了我們
He played us.

565
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,650
恩佐那個老家伙本來就沒打算賣給我們
Old Man Enzo had no intention of selling to us.

566
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,090
他是利用我們來抬價
He used us to up his price...

567
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,350
讓我們公司蒙羞  還侮辱了你的領導力
embarrass our company and insult your leadership.

568
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,890
整件事從一開始就不是個好主意
It was a bad idea from the start.

569
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,750
他到底說了什么
What exactly did he say?

570
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,560
他說福特制造丑陋的小汽車
He said Ford makes ugly little cars,

571
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,210
還說我們的工廠...
and we make 'em...

572
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,180
很丑陋
in an ugly factory.

573
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:51,700
他說我們的管理層都是王八蛋
He said our executives are sons of whores.

574
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,170
說了我什么
About me?

575
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,990
他說您胖  先生
He called you fat, sir.

576
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,950
頑固
Pigheaded.

577
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,070
繼續
Go on.

578
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,160
他說您不是亨利·福特
He said you're not Henry Ford.

579
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,810
您只是亨利·福特二世
You're Henry Ford II.

580
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,840
我要找到最好的工程師
I want the best engineers.

581
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,660
最好的車手
The best drivers.

582
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,830
我不在乎花費
I don't care what it costs.

583
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,980
我們要造一輛賽車
We're gonna build a race car.

584
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,530
我們要把那個
And we're gonna bury

585
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,430
渾身機油的意大利佬
that goddamn greasy wop

586
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:04,300
深埋在勒芒終點線的百尺之下
100 feet deep under the finish line at Le Mans.

587
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,840
我會親自到場見證這一幕的
And I will be there to watch it.

588
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,220
她們來了  快快快
Here they come. Go, go, go, go.

589
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,270
混蛋
Assholes.

590
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,200
你們太可悲了
You're really pathetic.

591
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,450
十分抱歉  美女們
I'm so sorry, girls.

592
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:19,240
查理
Charlie!

593
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,970
別成天沖著女孩子們扔爆竹了
Quit throwing crackers at the girls all damn day.

594
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:22,970
該死的
God damn it.

595
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,390
需要我去處理嗎
Do I gotta deal with this?

596
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:25,790
已經處理好了
It's already taken care of.

597
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,190
抱歉
Sorry about that.

598
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:31,470
沒錯  289立方英寸的V8發動機
So, yeah, 289 cubic inch V8.

599
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,240
牛逼
Far out.

600
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,610
大范圍地改造了AC Ace跑車的前段
Extensive rework of AC Ace's front end.

601
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,690
配有更強的后差速器來應付扭矩
And a stronger rear diff to handle the torque.

602
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,330
它在402米加速賽里表現如何
How's she handle a quarter mile?

603
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,030
我不是讓你去參加直線加速賽
Well, now, I'm not saying you should go drag racing,

604
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:43,140
但它跑402米用時13.6秒
but a quarter mile's 13.6.

605
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:44,080
沒錯
Yeah.

606
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,830
-這樣算快的嗎  -非常快了
- Is that good? - Oh, that's real good.

607
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,660
他這周之內把同一輛車賣了三遍了
He sold that same car three times this week.

608
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,010
-收現金嗎  現金可以嗎  -現金可以
- You take cash? Is cash okay? - Cash is okay.

609
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:51,530
沒錯  先生
Yeah, mister,

610
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:53,490
你剛給自己買了輛了不得的跑車
you just bought yourself one hell of a sport car.

611
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:54,260
好啊
All right.

612
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,110
你猜怎么著  我得...  菲爾
Tell you what, I'm gonna... Phil!

613
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,860
我讓我的同事來接待你
I'm gonna pass you off to my colleague here.

614
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,030
他會好好招呼你的
He gonna take care of you.

615
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,340
-菲爾  這位是懷亞特  -你好
- Phil, Wyatt. - Hello.

616
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,580
懷亞特  我把他借走一下
Wyatt, I'm gonna steal him for one second.

617
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,830
你來收錢
You take the payment.

618
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,790
無論你用什么方法  別讓他把車開走
Whatever you do, do not let him take that car.

619
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,090
那是杰夫·布利策的車
That's Jeff Blitzer's car.

620
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,360
也是弗蘭克·柯林斯和史蒂夫·麥奎恩的車
And Frank Collins' and Steve McQueen's.

621
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,540
該死  我忘了麥奎恩了
Shit. I forgot about McQueen.

622
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,410
早上好
Morning.

623
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,400
有什么事嗎
Can I help you?

624
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,590
卡羅爾·謝爾比
Carroll Shelby?

625
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:24,850
也許吧
Maybe.

626
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,560
李·艾亞科卡  福特汽車
Lee Iacocca, Ford Motor.

627
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,110
這個扳手有什么故事
What's with the wrench?

628
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,160
那個啊  說來話長了
That? Oh, long story.

629
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:40,120
我們這里越做越大了  李
We are just going from strength to strength here, Lee.

630
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:43,180
銷售額亮眼  賽道上成績斐然
Terrific sales, we're killing it on the track.

631
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,770
我知道上一批發動機的錢
Now, I know I owe Ford

632
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:45,780
我還沒給福特...
for that last batch of engines...

633
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,450
謝爾比先生  你放心
Mr. Shelby, I can assure you

634
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,590
我來這里不是為了
I'm not here for money

635
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,860
你欠福特的那些零部件的錢
that you might owe Ford for spare parts.

636
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:52,750
不是為這個
You're not?

637
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,570
不  不是的
No, I'm not.

638
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,300
好吧
Okay.

639
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,730
我是代表福特先生來的  亨利·福特二世
I'm here on behalf of Mr. Ford, Henry Ford II.

640
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,370
如果  假設一下
Suppose, um, hypothetically,

641
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,340
他希望他的公司
that he wanted his company

642
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,200
能贏得勒芒24小時耐力賽
to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

643
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,710
你是少數贏過的美國人
You're one of the only Americans that's ever done it...

644
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,250
所以我想知道
so I'm wondering...

645
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,870
要付出什么努力
what's it take?

646
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,820
假設嗎
Hypothetically?

647
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:21,990
假設
Hypothetically.

648
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,560
要付出的努力是錢買不到的
It takes something money can't buy.

649
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,130
錢可以買來速度
Money can buy speed.

650
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,150
但與速度無關  李
But it isn't about speed, Lee.

651
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,240
它不像其它的賽道
It's not just like those other tracks

652
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,850
只需要四個小時里不斷左轉
where all you do is turn to the left for four hours.

653
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,460
要想贏  需要一輛車
To win that race, you need a car

654
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,760
足夠輕  可以在直道上達到時速320公里
that's light enough to do 200 on the straightaways

655
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,000
足夠強  可以保持這個速度
but strong enough to keep that up

656
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,510
連續跑近五千公里
for 3,000 miles without a break.

657
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,770
需要的不僅是
Not just the best car

658
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,810
你們制造過的最好的車  還要
y'all have ever made, but better than anything

659
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,140
比恩佐·法拉利當年參賽的車更好
that Enzo Ferrari shows up with that year.

660
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,630
這還只是你的入場券
And that just gets you to the green flag.

661
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,540
接下來才是真正的問題
That's where your problems really start.

662
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:02,230
沒事吧
Is everything okay?

663
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:04,330
一邊去
Go away.

664
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,370
所以你覺得有難度
So you're saying it's challenging.

665
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,250
聽著  那都不算是賽道  李
Look, it's not even a track, Lee.

666
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,460
勒芒是13.7公里的鄉村道路
Le Mans is eight and a half miles of country road.

667
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,810
狹窄崎嶇  很難開
It's narrow, ungraded, it's rough.

668
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:29,110
轉彎處沒有預拱度  也沒有欄桿
There's no camber on the turns, no rails.

669
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,470
要開24小時
You gotta do that for 24 hours.

670
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,590
24小時啊  李
Twenty-four hours, Lee.

671
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,880
也就是說包括夜晚
That means night.

672
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:43,560
有一半的時間是夜里  屁都看不清
Half that race is in the dark. You can't see shit.

673
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,100
時不時有車不知道從哪竄出來
Cars coming up on you out of nowhere.

674
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,850
車手在賽道上出事  鮮血如注
Drivers stumbling around the track, pouring blood.

675
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,570
或許其中就有你的朋友  或許...
Maybe one of 'em is your friend. Maybe...

676
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,380
或許他身上會著火
Maybe he's on fire.

677
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,570
你筋疲力盡  饑腸轆轆
You're exhausted, you're hungry...

678
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,840
記不清自己的名字  忘記自己在哪
can't remember your name, what country you're in.

679
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,990
突然  你意識到自己正在直道上時速319公里
And all of a sudden, you realize you're doing 198 on a straight.

680
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,360
一旦有差錯
And if anything goes wrong...

681
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:17,400
一個墊圈壞掉  只值五美分的墊圈
you blow a gasket, a five-cent washer...

682
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,330
那就完了  都結束了
that's it, whole thing's over.

683
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,540
法拉利又贏了
Ferrari wins again.

684
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,270
就像去年和前年一樣
Just like he won last year and the year before that.

685
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,670
還有大前年
And the year before that.

686
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:31,380
沒錯
Yeah.

687
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,850
有難度
It's challenging.

688
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,610
所以你覺得
So you don't think...

689
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,550
福特汽車公司無法造出
that Ford Motor Company can build

690
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,830
有史以來最棒的賽車
the greatest race car the world's ever seen?

691
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:43,220
你覺得我們無法
You think that we are incapable

692
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,300
贏得這樣的比賽
of winning an event like that?

693
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,670
即使我們有厲害的合伙人
Even if we had a brilliant partner?

694
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,880
即使我們有不設上限的預算
Even if we wrote a, uh, blank check?

695
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,050
我說的是  你買不來冠軍  李
What I'm saying is, you can't buy a win, Lee.

696
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:10,990
但或許你可以買來有機會奪冠的人
But maybe you could buy the guy who gets you a shot.

697
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:28,580
{\an8}修車店

698
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:31,960
換新的變速器  輪軸和減震器
A new transmission, axles, shocks all around,

699
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,360
把車身和輪胎都丟掉  這才有競爭力
ditch the body and the tires, you have yourself a contender.

700
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,290
這寶貝里面還有正常的東西嗎
Anything on this beauty that does work?

701
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,140
后視鏡挺不錯的
The mirrors are outstanding.

702
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,630
我走過來的時候就發現了
I saw that walking up.

703
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:48,020
所以你是晚上遛彎路過嗎
So, what, you just passing on an evening stroll?

704
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:51,010
斗牛犬  其實我有一份工作給你
Actually, Bulldog, I have a proposition for you.

705
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:55,460
你要造一輛能擊敗法拉利老爺子的車
You're gonna build a car to beat Old Man Ferrari...

706
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,190
-對  -和福特合作
- Yeah. - ...with Ford?

707
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,450
用福特的車
With a Ford?

708
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:00,310
沒錯
Correct.

709
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,800
你告訴他們需要多長時間
And how long did you tell them that you needed?

710
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,590
兩三百年嗎
Two, three hundred years?

711
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,010
九十天
Ninety days.

712
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:13,870
好吧  我們來梳理一下
All right, so let's just look at this for a moment.

713
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,490
為了論證
And for argument's sake,

714
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:17,940
我們先不提九十天這事
let's just forget about the whole 90-day thing.

715
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,610
所以先假設錢和時間
So let's just pretend you've got all the money in the world

716
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:22,000
都應有盡有
and all the time in the world.

717
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,540
-我喜歡這個開頭  -好吧
- I like the sound of that. - All right.

718
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,570
那
So...

719
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:28,370
你覺得福特會讓你
you think that Ford are gonna let you build

720
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,250
按你的想法
the car that you want...

721
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,060
去造你想要的車嗎
the way you want it?

722
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:37,240
那個福特汽車公司
The Ford Motor Company?

723
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:39,590
那些人
Those guys?

724
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,640
你去過底特律嗎
Have you ever been to Detroit?

725
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,100
他們有好幾層都是律師
They have floors and floors of lawyers

726
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,920
有成千上萬的營銷人員
and millions of marketing guys,

727
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,960
他們都要和你見面
and they're all gonna want to meet you.

728
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,320
他們都要和偉大的卡羅爾·謝爾比
They're gonna want to get their photo taken

729
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,680
一起合影
with the great Carroll Shelby,

730
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,520
他們會拍你馬屁
and they're gonna kiss your ass

731
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,850
然后回到他們溫馨的辦公室里
and go back to their lovely offices...

732
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:56,140
想出新的辦法來搞你
and they're gonna work out new ways to screw you.

733
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,880
為什么  因為他們不由自主
Why? Because they can't help it.

734
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,540
因為他們想要讓老板高興
Because they just want to please their boss

735
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,990
而他們的老板想要讓自己的老板高興  依次類推
who wants please his boss who wants to please his boss.

736
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,700
他們為此而厭惡自己
And they hate themselves for it.

737
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,280
但在心底里
But deep down...

738
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,490
他們更厭惡的
who they hate even more

739
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:11,800
是你這樣的人
are guys like you,

740
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,230
因為你與他們不同
because you're not like them,

741
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,900
因為你與他們思考的方式不同
because you don't think like them,

742
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,910
因為你不一樣
because you're different.

743
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,070
這是大魔王的意思
It's coming straight from the Deuce.

744
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,070
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}亨利·福特二世綽號"漢克大魔王"

745
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,810
他是認真的
He's serious.

746
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,720
他們會真金白銀地支持
They're gonna put real money behind it.

747
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,030
我敢說是的
I'll bet they are.

748
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,100
你知道為什么嗎
You know why?

749
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:35,680
因為有人  我沒說是誰
Because someone, and I'm not saying who,

750
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:41,550
有人告訴他們這是可能做成的
someone has told them that this is actually possible.

751
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:42,660
聽我說
Look...

752
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,350
這周日在科洛弗
this Sunday at Cloverfield,

753
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,640
他們會發布新的野馬汽車
they're launching the new Mustang.

754
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,490
并宣布賽車項目
They're gonna announce the race program.

755
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:49,790
來看看吧
Just come on by.

756
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,990
來看看  聽聽我的演講
Come take a look. Listen to my speech.

757
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,630
我會發表演講
I'm making a speech.

758
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,120
帶彼得來吧  他會喜歡的
Bring Peter. He'll love it.

759
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,310
好吧  謝爾
All right, Shel.

760
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,460
周日見
See you Sunday.

761
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,520
爸爸  看啊
Dad, look at that.

762
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:21,230
{\an8}野馬

763
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:20,660
福特野馬  你覺得怎么樣
The Ford Mustang. What do you think?

764
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,080
我覺得這是秘書開的車
I think it's a secretary's car.

765
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,120
我喜歡
I like it.

766
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,780
抱...抱歉
Excu... Excuse me.

767
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,270
請你  請你不要那么做
Would you, would you not do that?

768
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:39,870
對不起
Sorry.

769
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,170
他是  他是你兒子嗎
Is this, is this your son?

770
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:47,400
是的
Yes, it is.

771
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,000
能請你讓他別碰車嗎
Would you ask him to keep his hands off the paintwork?

772
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:51,920
沒事  沒事  彼得
No, no, no, Peter.

773
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:53,490
沒關系  你是誰
You're okay. Who are you?

774
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:57,460
里奧·畢比  福特汽車公司的高級執行副總裁
Leo Beebe, Senior Executive Vice President, Ford Motor Company.

775
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,240
我負責野馬的發布
I'm responsible for the launch of the Mustang.

776
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:03,190
至少我們知道這是誰的責任了
At least now we know who's responsible.

777
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,390
別理解錯了  萊尼
Don't get me wrong, Lenny.

778
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:07,200
-是里奧  -車看起來很不錯
- Leo. - It looks fantastic.

779
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,420
但內部太繁瑣了
But inside, it's a lump of lard

780
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,680
花里胡哨的  糊弄普通人
dressed up to fool the public.

781
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,610
我的建議是
My advice is,

782
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:15,710
縮減直列六缸發動機和白癡的三檔加速
lose the inline-six and that idiotic three-speed,

783
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:19,450
縮短軸距  就能減輕半噸重量
shorten the wheelbase, somehow lose half a ton,

784
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,010
還能降低成本
and lower the price.

785
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:21,620
爸爸
Dad.

786
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,830
但就算是那樣
But even then,

787
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:25,630
我也更愿意買雪佛蘭
I'd still choose a Chevy Chevelle.

788
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:28,780
而那輛車可是爛得不行
And that's a fucking terrible car.

789
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:31,600
怎么樣了  史蒂夫
How are we doing up there, Steve?

790
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:33,970
科洛弗到了  謝爾比先生
There's Cloverfield, Mr. Shelby.

791
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,730
是啊
Oh, yeah.

792
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,670
介意我試一試著陸嗎
You mind if I take a shot at the landing?

793
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,330
不不不  我沒開玩笑
No, no, no. I mean it.

794
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:43,220
我1944年在圣安東尼奧開過B29轟炸機
I flew B-29s out of San Antone in '44.

795
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,170
你在開玩笑吧
You're kidding.

796
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,300
-沒騙你  -好吧
- I did. - Okay.

797
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,420
卡羅爾  你做什么呢
Carroll, what are you doing?

798
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:49,210
-他會開飛機嗎  -卡羅爾
- Does he know how to fly? - Carroll.

799
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,660
我以前有位指導員告訴我...
I had an instructor tell me, he said...

800
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,150
唐  我看現在最好系好安全帶
Don, I would say it's probably a good time to buckle up.

801
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:56,200
"為了大家好  別上天了"
"...do everybody a favor, stay on the ground."

802
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,410
我說真的
That's a true story.

803
00:43:58,690 --> 00:43:59,900
-不  -該死
- Oh, no. - Oh, shit.

804
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,700
-該死的  -開始了
- God damn it. - Here we go.

805
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:08,270
{\an8}野馬

806
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:02,740
這是一輛
This is the car

807
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,990
你想不到會出自底特律的車
you never expected from Detroit.

808
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:10,330
好了  走吧
All right. Let's go.

809
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,090
不留下來嗎  肯
Not staying, Ken?

810
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,110
都他媽是沖動消費  對吧
Ah, it's a bloody pig in a poke, isn't it?

811
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:18,210
他們來了
Here they come now.

812
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,590
-等等  他們要墜毀了嗎  -我的天
- Wait. Are they crashing? - Oh, Lord.

813
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,960
飛行員是誰
Who's the pilot?

814
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,990
要我猜的話  彼得
My guess, Peter...

815
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,790
是我們認識的人
it's someone we know.

816
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:36,910
一切都還好嗎
Everything all right up there?

817
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,940
不
Oh, no.

818
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,850
-不  -坐好了
- No! - Hang on.

819
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:43,260
該死  該死  該死
Oh, shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

820
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:46,220
該死  該死  該死
Shit. Shit. Shit.

821
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,370
知道嗎  就像騎自行車一樣
Tell you what, that's like riding a bike.

822
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,250
這出場的仗勢真不小
Talk about making an entrance.

823
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,640
-謝爾比  -我的天
- Shelby... - Good grief.

824
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,310
-謝爾比  -好了
- Shelby! - All right!

825
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:01,390
-看這里  看這里  -謝爾比
- Over here. Over here! - Shelby!

826
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:02,930
你們好啊
How y'all doing?

827
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,260
能給我簽個名嗎
Can I get your autograph, please?

828
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,620
能給我簽個名嗎  先生
Can I get your autograph, sir?

829
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,150
卡羅爾  這是羅伊·朗恩
Carroll, this is Roy Lunn.

830
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:08,350
老羅伊是來這里研發
Old Roy here is developing

831
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:09,730
英國設計的原型
the prototype over in England.

832
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:11,910
我認識羅伊  幸會  羅伊
Oh, hell, I know Roy. Good to see you, Roy.

833
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,160
歡迎來到瘋人院  謝爾比
Welcome to the madhouse, Shelby.

834
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,930
福特出動了整個管理層
Ford wheeled out the entire executive committee

835
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:15,720
來參加這一盛會
for this one.

836
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,040
稍等一下
Hold that thought.

837
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:20,650
你好  飛行家先生
Hello, Mr. Lindbergh.

838
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:23,000
你喜歡嗎  彼得  你好
You like that? Hey, Peter, how you doing?

839
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,220
-謝爾比先生  -很高興見到你
- Mr. Shelby. - Good to see you.

840
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:27,270
你要造一輛打敗法拉利的車嗎
Are you building a car that's gonna beat Ferrari?

841
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,360
我們要參加勒芒耐力賽  這是肯定的
Well, we're gonna go to Le Mans, that's for sure.

842
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,520
如果我們先沖過了終點線  那就會贏
And if we get across that finish line first, we're gonna win.

843
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,520
卡羅爾  我向你介紹里奧·畢比

844
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,590
福特汽車的高級副總裁

是啊
Yeah.

850
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:47,250
不是嗎
Didn't we?

851
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,850
所以...
So, um, well...

852
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:52,360
我帶彼得去衛生間
I'll take Petey for some pop.

853
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:54,070
祝你和這些人相處愉快  謝爾
Good luck with these guys, Shel.

別擔心  他會留下來的
Don't worry, he's gonna stay.

856
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,180
你們倆在飛機上有聊幾句嗎
So, you two get a chance to talk on the plane?

857
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:04,760
有
Yeah. Uh...

858
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,900
卡羅爾  我們借一步說話
Carroll, why don't we just step this way for a second?

859
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,600
這是慣例  走個過場
Look, it's pro forma. It's window dressing.

860
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,230
但在你得表現得有來有往
But there's gotta be a sense of give-and-take

861
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:19,680
和那些...
between you and...

862
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,460
你懂的
you know.

863
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,090
我不懂
No, I don't.

864
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:22,910
團隊
The group.

865
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,190
團隊
The group?

866
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:26,150
高級創意總監們  卡羅爾
Senior creatives, Carroll.

867
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,230
就是為了讓大家都自在些
Just to make sure everybody's comfortable.

868
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:29,930
我很困惑  李
Well, I'm confused, Lee.

869
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:31,410
因為直到這一刻  直到剛剛
'Cause up until this moment, right now,

870
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:32,720
我都還挺自在的
I was comfortable.

871
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,870
你應該往外看看  卡羅爾
You should take a look out there, Carroll.

872
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:36,840
你看到了什么
What do you see?

873
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:38,860
你知道我看到了什么嗎
You know what I see?

874
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,410
我看到了一個機器
I see a machine.

875
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,780
我看到了一萬個活動的零件
I see 10,000 moving parts,

876
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,100
希望能夠和諧地運轉
moving hopefully in harmony,

877
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,790
而這也是我的職責
and it's my job to make it so.

878
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:47,130
指導你在其中和諧運轉是我的職責
It's my job to guide you through it.

879
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:49,400
我是來這里幫你的  卡羅爾
I am here to help you, Carroll.

880
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,720
但你得信任我
But you gotta trust me.

881
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:53,510
-失陪了  李  -卡羅爾
- Excuse me, Lee. - Carroll...

882
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:56,090
如果你不信任我  就不要走上臺
do not step on that stage if you don't trust me.

883
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:58,670
有請卡羅爾·謝爾比先生
Please welcome Mr. Carroll Shelby.

884
00:46:58,670 --> 00:46:59,380
得走了
Gotta go.

885
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:05,930
-謝爾比  -謝爾比
- Shelby... - Oh. Shelby.

886
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:07,840
他說什么了
What'd he say?

887
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,110
他知道流程
He gets the drill.

888
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:14,110
{\an8}福特野馬

889
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:13,260
謝謝
Thank you.

890
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,030
要是我爸今天在這里
Well, if my daddy was here today...

891
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:17,840
他會讓我坐下
he'd tell me to sit on down

892
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,110
讓那些大學生來負責滔滔不絕
and leave the yakking to the college boys...

893
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:24,040
所以  就像我開車一樣  我會盡快講完
so, like my cars, I'll make this fast.

894
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:29,210
我十歲時  爸爸告訴我"兒子...
When I was 10 years old, Pops said to me, "Son...

895
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:33,280
清楚自己想做什么的人是很幸運的
It's a truly lucky man who knows what he wants to do in this world.

896
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,920
因為他這輩子做事都會樂在其中"
"'Cause that man will never work a day in his life."

897
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,590
但也有一小撮人  珍貴的一小撮人
But there are a few, a precious few,

898
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,930
我不知道他們幸運與否
and, hell, I don't know if they're lucky or not.

899
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,780
但有一小撮人
But there are a few people

900
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,610
找到了自己必須要做的事
who find something they have to do.

901
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,790
他們為之沉迷的事
Something obsesses 'em.

902
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,350
如果不去做那件事
Something that if they can't do it,

903
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:53,550
他們就會被逼瘋
it's gonna drive them clean out of their mind.

904
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:55,460
我就是那種人
I'm that guy.

905
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:59,640
我知道還有一個人也有同感
And I know one other man feels exactly the same.

906
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:01,890
他就是...
His name...

907
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,230
他就是亨利·福特先生
His name is Mr. Henry Ford.

908
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:12,880
并且我們會一起
And together, we're gonna build

909
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,120
制造出世界上速度最快的汽車
the fastest automobiles in the world.

910
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:21,460
我們也會在勒芒耐力賽中創造歷史
And we're gonna make history, too, at Le Mans.

911
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:26,080
-我們走  -什么
- Let's go. - What?

912
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:28,210
我叫卡羅爾·謝爾比
My name is Carroll Shelby.

913
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,460
我制造賽車
I build race cars.

914
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,660
不  不管是什么  都不要
No. Whatever it is, no.

915
00:48:58,050 --> 00:48:58,700
不
No.

916
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:00,990
三十分鐘
Thirty minutes.

917
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:04,550
我很累
Ah, just... I'm spent.

918
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:06,790
-我想洗個澡  - 你會想看看這個的
- I wanna have a bath. - You're gonna wanna see this.

919
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,250
相信我
Trust me.

920
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:12,460
三十分鐘  然后送你回來吃肉汁烘肉卷
Thirty minutes. I'll have you back for meatloaf and gravy.

921
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,090
三十分鐘
Thirty minutes.

922
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:17,890
對
Yeah.

923
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:34,420
{\an8}謝爾比美國公司

924
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,370
見鬼
Bloody hell.

925
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,120
剛從英國空運過來
Fresh off the plane from England.

926
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:51,960
它還沒有完全調配好
Now, she's still a little on the rare side of cooked.

927
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,060
來吧
Come on.

928
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:16,900
有意思
Interesting.

929
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,090
怎樣
Well?

930
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,260
很糟糕
It's awful.

931
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:37,980
比糟糕還要糟
It's worse than awful.

932
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,300
這車抓地力太差
Yeah, it doesn't track.

933
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,720
三檔太高了
You know, the third gear is too high.

934
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,310
扭矩碰不到路面
Torque is not reaching the road.

935
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:49,450
因為前端太輕  轉向裝置不敏感
Steering's loose because the front end gets light.

936
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:52,060
并且速度超過225公里  它就成了...
And over 140, it thinks it's a...

937
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,040
飛機
Airplane.

938
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:53,610
對
Yeah.

939
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:56,280
它想起飛去夏威夷
It wants to lift off and fly to Hawaii.

940
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,070
還有嗎
Anything else?

941
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:06,950
等一下
One sec.

942
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,530
你昨晚回來很晚
You were back late last night.

943
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:40,400
對
Yeah.

944
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:45,410
你是在工作嗎
Were you working?

945
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,620
你沒去別的地方
So, you didn't go anyplace?

946
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,170
什么
What?

947
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:58,340
我是問  你昨晚沒去其它地方嗎
Well, I'm asking, did you go anyplace last night?

948
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:01,260
莫莉
Mollie.

949
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,550
這是個簡單的問題
It's a simple question.

950
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,350
我也回答了  不是嗎
And I answered, didn't I?

951
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:09,140
回答是什么
What was the answer?

952
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:12,690
出了什么事嗎  親愛的
Is something up, love?

953
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:16,540
你在做什么  你在做什么
What are you doing? What are you doing?

954
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,290
你開得特別快
You're driving very fast.

955
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:19,650
是嗎  是嗎
Oh, am I? Am I?

956
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,990
你就是
Yes, you are.

957
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,240
見鬼  你這是...這是做什么
Bloody hell! What are you... the hell is this?

958
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:27,300
你告訴我  因為我不知道
Well, you tell me, 'cause I don't know.

959
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,370
行  開慢點
Right, slow down!

960
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:31,200
莫莉
Mollie!

961
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:36,180
請你開慢點  好嗎
Please slow it down, all right?

962
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,850
你想殺了我們還是怎樣
You trying to kill us or something?

963
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:40,130
-我還以為我們喜歡這樣呢  -什么
- Well, I thought we love this shit. - What?

964
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,440
-見鬼  -這就是賽車的快感  不是嗎
- Bloody hell! - It's a bit of racing fun. No?

965
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,090
不不不  完全不一樣
No, no, no. It's not the same at all.

966
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,800
我還以為很刺激呢
Well, I think it's thrilling!

967
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:49,350
行
All right.

968
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,060
我看到你了  行嗎
Look, I saw you, all right?

969
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:55,830
我看見你和謝爾比一起離開  我看到你回來
I saw you leaving with Shelby, and I saw you coming back.

970
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:57,830
好  見鬼  行  你慢點
Okay. Shit. Okay, but slow it...

971
00:52:57,830 --> 00:52:59,700
然后你就保持這種傻乎乎的表情一整天了
And then all day you've got that stupid look on your face.

972
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:02,150
莫莉  開慢點  你離得太近了
Mollie, slow down. You're too close here.

973
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,550
莫莉  趕緊踩剎車
Mollie, put on the brakes right now...

974
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:09,760
你不告訴我出了什么事  我就不停
Not until you tell me what's going on!

975
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,300
行  我去看了一輛車
All right. I went to look at a car.

976
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,210
-和謝爾比一起  -和謝爾比一起
- With Shelby? - With Shelby.

977
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,250
-一輛賽車  -差不多吧
- A racing car? - Sort of.

978
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,630
要轉彎了  你最好抓緊點
There's a corner coming. You'd better hold on.

979
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:23,730
你準備一直踩著油門嗎
Are you gonna lift your foot off at all through this?

980
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:25,350
對  因為我喜歡干凈利落的比賽路線
No, 'cause I like a clean racing line.

981
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,590
慢點
Slow down!

982
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:31,510
好吧
Okay.

983
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:32,890
謝爾給了我一個工作
Shel offered me a job.

984
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:36,620
福特有一輛想用來和法拉利比賽的車
Ford has a car that they want to put up against a Ferrari.

985
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,330
-你告訴我你不干了  -就是這樣  現在慢點
You told me you were done. That's it. Now, slow...

986
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:40,160
我沒同意
I didn't say yes.

987
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,330
慢點
Slow down.

988
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:42,820
你告訴我你不干了
You told me you quit.

989
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,240
-我不懂  -養老享福  你說的
- I don't understand. - Get fat and old, you said.

990
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:47,950
養老享福
Fat and old.

991
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:53,630
-我不懂  -你是那么告訴我的
- I don't understand. - That's what you told me.

992
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:55,250
我不懂
I don't understand.

993
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:57,050
你生氣是因為我說我不干了
Are you upset because I said I was done

994
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:59,710
還是因為我看了一輛賽車
or because I looked at a race car?

995
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,170
別對我說謊  肯
Just don't lie to me, Ken.

996
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,900
別因為你覺得我會高興
Don't make it a secret,

997
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,440
就對你想要什么
what you want or what you feel,

998
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,180
你感覺如何  藏著掖著
just because you think it's gonna make me happy.

999
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,270
莫  我都不知道我是什么感覺
Moll, I don't even know what I feel.

1000
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:23,940
如果你要參賽
If you do this...

1001
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,860
那他這次最好給你錢
then he better be paying you this time.

1002
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:34,550
因為我增加工作時間就沒法照顧彼得
'Cause I can't work any more hours and look after Peter.

1003
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:35,800
國稅局已經封了修車店
You know, the IRS have the garage.

1004
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,960
我不要再失去我的家
I'm not losing my home.

1005
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,130
一天兩百塊
It's 200 a day.

1006
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:44,670
還報銷開支
Plus expenses.

1007
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,800
你在跟我開玩笑嗎
Are you shitting me?

1008
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:51,430
但我還沒有決定
But I haven't decided.

1009
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,890
一天兩百美金
$200 a day?

1010
00:54:58,660 --> 00:54:59,770
你瘋了嗎
Are you nuts?

1011
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:07,330
{\an8}柳泉賽道

1012
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:26,270
看看這個  太離譜了  這里
Look at this. This is ridiculous. Here.

1013
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:28,920
謝爾  它吸氣
So, Shel, grabbing air.

1014
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,470
這就是問題
That's the problem.

1015
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:35,440
速度超過145公里  空氣就只進不出
Over 90, air's getting in, not getting out.

1016
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,490
問題在車頭  我開的時候感覺到了
It's the nose, I can feel it in the wheel.

1017
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:38,820
邁爾斯先生  如果有問題
Mr. Miles, if there's a problem,

1018
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:39,850
電腦會發現的
the computer will find it.

1019
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:41,060
行  查理
All right. Charlie,

1020
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:43,480
去拿點膠帶和毛線
get some Scotch tape and a ball of wool.

1021
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,780
好了  很好
All right. Good, good, good.

1022
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:51,070
現在我們把這些垃圾拆掉
So, now let's just, uh, get all of this junk out.

1023
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:51,880
對嗎  老爹
Right, Pops?

1024
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,370
對對  我同意
Yeah, yeah. I concur.

1025
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:54,160
來吧  伙計們
Come on, guys.

1026
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:58,240
他們在做什么
What are they doing?

1027
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,330
讓你的車跑得更快些
Making your car faster.

1028
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,130
這里  就這里
There. Right there.

1029
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,510
氣流開始堵塞了
Airflow's getting stuck.

1030
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:16,390
我看到了  毛線直直往上飄
I see it. Yarn blows straight up.

1031
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:17,720
-對  -前面在飄高
- Yep. - The front's lifting.

1032
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:18,970
見鬼  他說得對
Damn, he's right.

1033
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:33,200
這輛車想變得更快  我能感覺出來
This car wants to go faster. I feel it.

1034
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:35,530
再輕點就會變得脆弱
Any lighter, we're getting fragile.

1035
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:38,090
上星期它已經減重了三十公斤
Took 70 pounds out of her in the last week.

1036
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:41,120
通過這次改裝  它已經輸出了最大馬力了
She's outputting max horsepower from this displacement.

1037
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,180
那就換個更大的發動機
So put in a bigger engine.

1038
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:44,670
我們要把發動機放在哪  車頂嗎
Where we gonna put it? On the roof?

1039
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:49,600
設法讓它比納斯卡車賽標準
Managed to make it 52 pounds lighter

1040
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,340
輕了二十三公斤
than the NASCAR unit.

1041
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:58,560
全新的鋁制缸蓋
All-new aluminum cylinder heads...

1042
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:02,770
減振器  水泵  更小的閥門
vibration dampeners, water pump, smaller valves.

1043
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,230
我們稱之為野獸
We call it the Beast.

1044
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:06,080
我能看出原因
Yeah, I can see why,

1045
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,330
但不改裝機座的話
but how's it gonna fit

1046
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:09,360
要怎么把它塞進去
without a redesign of the engine bed?

1047
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:10,790
那肯定不容易
Well, it certainly wasn't easy.

1048
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:12,120
早安  先生們  謝爾比先生
Good morning, gentlemen. Mr. Shelby.

1049
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:16,450
你們已經把那個裝進了一臺GT40嗎
So, you already put that in a GT40?

1050
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:18,410
恐怕確實如此
I'm afraid we have.

1051
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:25,460
真想不到
I'll be damned.

1052
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:27,680
當然  那很重
Well, it's heavy, of course.

1053
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,390
控制起來有點困難  特別是剎車
Problems with the handling, especially the stopping.

1054
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:31,300
-我能給你看數據  -有什么問題
- I can show you the data. - What problems?

1055
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:32,940
轉向有點失靈  但是...
Understeers a little, but...

1056
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:33,670
我能借用一下那個嗎
Can I borrow that?

1057
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,800
就一下  謝謝
Just a second. Thank you.

1058
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:36,590
肯
Ken!

1059
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:40,900
肯  你在測試前要不要先和總部協商一下
Ken, perhaps you want to check with HQ before you test...

1060
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:41,640
他說什么
What did he say?

1061
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:42,930
我們得問問...
We should ask...

1062
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:44,600
好吧
Right.

1063
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:50,060
太棒了
Oh, yes!

1064
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,880
謝爾比先生  歡迎來到迪爾伯恩
Mr. Shelby, welcome to Dearborn.

1065
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,960
你怎么想到來看試車
What are you doing at a test track?

1066
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,330
你的漂亮西裝會沾上嘉實多汽油的
You're gonna get Castrol oil all over that nice suit.

1067
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:06,180
我想聽聽你對一些計劃中的決策有什么意見
I wanted to hear your thoughts on a few planning decisions.

1068
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:07,670
關于勒芒耐力賽的參賽人員
You know, personnel for Le Mans.

1069
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,250
我們陣容強大
Well, it's a hell of a lineup.

1070
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:10,790
肯·邁爾斯  菲爾·希爾
Ken Miles, Phil Hill,

1071
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,100
克里斯·阿蒙  布魯斯·邁凱輪
Chris Amon, Bruce McLaren.

1072
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:15,420
希爾去定了  阿蒙和邁凱輪也是
Hill's a lock. Amon, McLaren, too.

1073
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,010
我們對邁爾斯參賽不太確定
We're less sure about Miles.

1074
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:18,720
我們喜歡里奇·金瑟爾
We like Richie Ginther...

1075
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:21,760
馬斯滕·格里高利  鮑勃·邦杜蘭特
Masten Gregory, Bob Bondurant.

1076
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,490
你們想要最好的車手
Well, you're gonna want the best driver for the car.

1077
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:25,810
懂車的車手
Understands the machine.

1078
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:27,100
肯就是最佳人選
That's Ken.

1079
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:29,560
太棒了
Oh! Yes!

1080
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:33,910
再給點勁  快  再給點勁  寶貝
More of that, please. More of that, my girl.

1081
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:36,080
你或許比我更懂賽車  謝爾比先生
I may not get the finer points of racing, Mr. Shelby,

1082
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,400
但我懂人
but I do know people.

1083
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:38,990
邁爾斯是...
Miles is a...

1084
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:42,160
他屬于"垮掉的一代"  從穿著看得出來
Well, he's a beatnik. He dresses like one.

1085
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:44,790
福特象征著可靠
Ford means reliability.

1086
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:46,620
肯·邁爾斯無法代表福特的形象
Ken Miles is not a Ford man.

1087
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,960
加把勁  加把勁
Giddy-up! Giddy-up!

1088
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,670
目前圈速紀錄是多少  伯特
What's the lap record here, Burt?

1089
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:57,050
1分58秒
1:58.

1090
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,580
他跑了1分50秒
1:50 dead.

1091
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:00,800
"垮掉的一代"
A beatnik?

1092
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,440
那個男人在諾曼底登陸戰役中
That man landed a busted tank

1093
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,480
開著一架故障坦克登陸沙灘
on the beach at D-Day

1094
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:05,470
然后順利地橫穿歐洲開到柏林
and drove it clean across Europe to Berlin.

1095
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,310
這哪算"垮掉的一代"
A beatnik?

1096
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:09,490
李不久前問我
You know, Lee here asked me a while back,

1097
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:11,230
"錢買不到的那樣東西是什么"
"What's the one thing money can't buy?"

1098
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:13,480
我告訴你答案
I'll tell you what it is.

1099
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,030
是把握方向盤的那個純粹的賽車手
A pure racer behind the wheel of your car.

1100
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,070
肯·邁爾斯便是
That's Ken Miles.

1101
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,530
話雖如此
Well, be that as it may...

1102
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:24,370
我們覺得他有點太純粹了
we think he may be too pure.

1103
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:35,550
卡羅爾  要顧全大局
Carroll, do not lose sight of the big picture here.

1104
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:37,840
"太純粹了"
"Too pure"?

1105
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:40,430
這是什么意思
What exactly does that mean?

1106
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:43,180
意思是他太自我了
It means he's all about himself.

1107
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:46,990
美國廣播公司采訪他的時候
ABC puts a microphone under his nose,

1108
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:49,140
或許會有他不喜歡的細節
perhaps there's a detail he dislikes,

1109
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,440
屆時有幾百萬觀眾...
millions watching...

1110
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,870
你確定他不會亂說話嗎
do you trust him not to put out the wrong message?

1111
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:54,370
你們可以找個外表光鮮
Well, look, you can get a clean-cut,

1112
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:55,580
上鏡的典型美國小子
all-American poster boy

1113
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:56,700
讓他坐上賽車
and stick him behind the wheel,

1114
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:57,900
教他怎么說話
teach him what to say.

1115
00:59:58,210 --> 00:59:59,830
你們不如讓多麗絲·戴參賽吧
Shit, you get Doris Day to drive the car,

1116
00:59:58,210 --> 00:59:59,830
{\an3}{\pos(380,235)}美國二戰后著名歌手

1117
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:01,200
如果你們想輸的話
if all you want to do is lose.

1118
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:04,280
所以你在這件事上有不同意見
So, you don't agree with us on this issue?

1119
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:08,750
我是說你得相信我的選人眼光
I'm saying you gotta trust me on this one.

1120
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,180
卡羅爾  考慮到營銷因素
Carroll, with marketing concerns,

1121
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,500
這不可能
that's just not possible.

1122
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,660
選一個福特類型的車手開著福特車參賽
Put a Ford-type driver in a Ford car,

1123
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:17,590
謝爾比先生
Mr. Shelby.

1124
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:19,800
這是福特的做事方式
That's the Ford way.

1125
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,940
法拉利又贏下了一場錦標賽
Yet another championship win for Ferrari

1126
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:30,820
英國賽車手約翰·瑟蒂斯
as British driver John Surtees

1127
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:32,450
開著法拉利312...
pilots his Ferrari 312...

1128
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:33,520
法拉利贏了
Ferrari wins.

1129
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:37,040
這是瑟蒂斯自1964年以來的首場勝利...
It's Surtees' first win since the '64...

1130
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,790
楔木  我們有楔木了
Wedges. We have wedges.

1131
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:40,280
很好  很好
Oh, good, good, good.

1132
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:41,740
完美
Perfect.

1133
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,780
-一米嗎  -對
- 40? - Yep.

1134
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,720
-你好  老板  -你好  丹
- Hey, boss. - Hey, Dan.

1135
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,270
老板  法拉利剛剛拿下了...
Boss, Ferrari just bagged...

1136
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:58,040
你有護照嗎
You got a passport?

1137
01:00:58,430 --> 01:00:59,140
那是什么
What's that?

1138
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:00,630
簽字  申請一個護照
Sign that. Get a passport.

1139
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:02,900
周五前交給我  弗羅斯特
Get it back to me by Friday. Frosty.

1140
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,340
伙計們  我要去法國了
Boys, I'm going to France.

1141
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,140
菲爾
Phil.

1142
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:09,010
肯  能談談嗎
Ken, can I get a word?

1143
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,110
我能留下這個嗎
Can I take this?

1144
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:24,290
你知道為什么福特給車取名GT40嗎
Do you know why Ford named it the GT40?

1145
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:26,250
為什么是"40"
Why they put that "40" on there?

1146
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:28,300
-不知道  -這是規定  知道嗎
- No. - Regulations. All right?

1147
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,620
車身要有40英寸[一米]高
We gotta be 40 inches high

1148
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,870
才能滿足離地間隙要求
to make the ground clearance requirements.

1149
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:34,890
不多不少
No more, no less.

1150
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:36,430
他們在每場比賽前都會測量
They measure it before every race.

1151
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:39,380
問題是這么高的車身
Problem is, that with that height,

1152
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,560
車底阻力太大了  對吧
there's too much drag under the car, all right?

1153
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,260
所以我們想了個辦法
So, we have a solution.

1154
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,060
楔木  我們把楔木放在
Wedges. We put wedges

1155
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:47,640
-懸掛上...  -你下周不能去
- in the suspension... - You're not coming next week.

1156
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:52,060
你不能去  肯
You're not coming, Ken.

1157
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:56,190
我們會帶上邁凱輪
We're taking McLaren,

1158
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,060
克里斯·阿蒙  菲爾·希爾...
Chris Amon, Phil Hill...

1159
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:00,610
還有鮑勃·邦杜蘭特
and Bob Bondurant.

1160
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:02,730
這是福特的決定
It's Ford's call.

1161
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,780
他們認為你形象欠佳
It is their opinion that you are not a good image,

1162
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,870
所以你不能開福特賽車
so you cannot drive their race car.

1163
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,300
即使是你盡心盡力把賽車
And putting aside the fact that you made that car

1164
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:13,490
改造成現在這樣...
whatever the hell it is...

1165
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:17,580
而且你是我眼中最棒的賽車手
and you're the best man I got behind the wheel...

1166
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,280
我會調整供油管路
I'm gonna reroute the oil line.

1167
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,990
要是發生泄漏  汽油會滴到
If there's spillage, it could drip

1168
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:43,730
-制動盤的左后方  -肯...
- onto the rear nearside disc. - Ken...

1169
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:45,160
告訴那些小子們
Tell the boys

1170
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:49,410
全程注意車速
to watch their pace come sunrise.

1171
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:52,700
變速箱會過熱
The, uh, the gearbox will overheat.

1172
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:02,520
{\an8}環球航空公司

1173

{\an8}謝爾比美國公司

01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,230
肯  比賽快開始了
Ken, the race is starting soon.

1175
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:13,300
要打開收音機嗎
Want it on the radio?

1176
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:14,930
不了  除非你想聽
Not unless you do.

1177
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:35,580
比賽
...of the race.

1178
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:36,300
他們來了
There they are.

1179
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,180
瑪莎拉蒂進入了埃索斯連續彎
The Maserati going into the Esses,

1180
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:39,510
但依然是2號車
but it's still the number 2 car,

1181
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:40,340
由克里斯·阿蒙駕駛
driven by Chris Amon.

1182
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:44,090
第三名是布魯斯·邁凱輪駕駛的福特1號
In third place is the number 1 Ford that is driven by Bruce McLaren.

1183
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,630
福特GT啟動速度尤為驚人
A tremendously fast start for the Ford GT.

1184
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:50,720
福特2號圈速3分43秒4
3:43.4 lap for car number 2, a Ford.

1185
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,570
我認為在比賽的這個階段速度有點太快了
I think it's a little bit quick for this stage of the game.

1186
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:54,650
現在有點開太快了
Little bit quick right now.

1187
01:03:54,650 --> 01:03:55,720
開得太急了
Racing too hot.

1188
01:03:57,820 --> 01:03:59,980
這能持續到最后大概一小時  你不覺得嗎
This could go down to the last hour or so, don't you think?

1189
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:01,370
或許可以  但是
It could, but the probabilities

1190
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:02,370
在24小時耐力賽里
for a finish like that

1191
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:04,480
出現這種終場的可能性極小
in a 24-hour race are awfully small.

1192
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:06,580
又一輛福特進入了維修站
Another Ford has come into the pits.

1193
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:08,190
修理工把車推進了
It's being pushed into the pits

1194
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:10,150
-維修站  -汽缸墊
- by the mechanics. - Head gasket.

1195
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:13,030
賽車不是航天火箭
The car's not a moon rocket.

1196
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:15,870
七號車緊隨鮑勃·邦杜蘭特  位居第四
Trailing Bob Bondurant in fourth, car number 7.

1197
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:19,040
隨后是邁克爾·帕克斯駕駛的法拉利20號
Leading number 20, Ferrari. Michael Parkes.

1198
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:21,390
所以目前福特包攬前三名  你怎么看
So, we have Ford running one, two, three. How about that?

1199
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,330
太快了  絕對太快了
Too soon. Surely too soon.

1200
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:29,420
維修工真的非常值得尊重...
One has to really be respectful of the mechanism with any...

1201
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:42,770
有條大新聞
Here's the big story,

1202
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:44,990
先前處于領先地位的里奇·金瑟爾駕駛的福特
the lead Ford, driven by Richie Ginther,

1203
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:47,700
由于變速箱故障退出了  最新的領先者是...
retired with gearbox trouble, and the new leader...

1204
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:51,710
變速箱  我告訴過他們  一定要小心
Gearbox. I told them. Be gentle with it.

1205
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:53,380
和他的搭檔洛倫佐·班迪尼
...and his partner Lorenzo Bandini...

1206
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:55,990
他是去年獲獎車手之一
...who was one of the winning drivers last year.

1207
01:04:57,710 --> 01:04:58,410
是誰
Who's there?

1208
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:01,550
我們又回來了
Again, we're back,

- All right. - Are you still willing

1242
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:25,180
賭上名譽相信這個人嗎
to stake your reputation on this guy?

1243
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,560
這邊請  謝爾比先生
This way, Mr. Shelby.

1244
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:39,780
福特先生
Mr. Ford.

1245
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:41,320
各位
Gentlemen.

1246
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:42,660
謝爾比
Shelby.

1247
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:59,060
給我一個理由  說服我不解雇
Give me one reason why I don't fire everyone

1248
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:02,130
由你牽頭的這一群殘兵敗將
associated with this abomination starting with you.

1249
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:09,640
先生
Well, sir...

1250
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,070
我坐在外面舒服的休息室里
I was thinking about that very question

1251
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:16,020
就在想這個問題
as I sat out there in your lovely waiting room.

1252
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:18,790
當我坐在那里
As I was sitting there...

1253
01:08:18,790 --> 01:08:22,570
我看見那個小小的紅色文件夾
I watched that little red folder right there...

1254
01:08:23,290 --> 01:08:25,120
四次經手...
go through four pairs of hands...

1255
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:27,620
才到達您手里
before it got to you.

1256
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:29,630
當然這還不包括
'Course that doesn't include...

1257
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:33,010
文件送到十九樓之前
the 22 or so other Ford employees

1258
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:34,140
很可能會接觸文件的
who probably poked at it

1259
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:36,040
二十多位其他福特員工
before it made its way up to the 19th floor.

1260
01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:39,300
恕我直言  先生
All due respect, sir,

1261
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,300
官僚主義是無法贏下比賽的
you can't win a race by committee.

1262
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:45,720
您需要一個負責人
You need one man in charge.

1263
01:08:46,570 --> 01:08:48,850
依我之見  好消息是
Now, the good news, as I see it,

1264
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,020
即使面臨這些重重困難
is that even with all the extra weight...

1265
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,280
我們還是成功擺布了
we still managed to put old Mr. Ferrari

1266
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,650
法拉利老頭
exactly where we want him.

1267
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:58,860
是嗎
Did we?

1268
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:00,570
是的
Oh, yes.

1269
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:03,820
解釋一下
Expand.

1270
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:06,120
這...
Well...

1271
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:09,200
當然了  我們之前沒有...
sure, we hadn't...

1272
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:12,450
我們還沒解決該如何過彎
We haven't worked out how to corner yet.

1273
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:14,830
發動機過熱
Or stay cool.

1274
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:17,880
抓地力也不足
Or stay on the ground.

1275
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:19,800
而且很多零件都壞了
And a lot of stuff broke.

1276
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:23,380
事實上  唯一沒壞的地方是剎車
In fact, the only thing that didn't break was the brakes.

1277
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:25,900
而且說白了  我們都沒辦法打包票
Hell, right now, we don't even know

1278
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:28,510
車漆能不能撐24小時不掉色
if our paint job will last the whole 24 hours.

1279
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:36,060
但最后一圈
But our last lap...

1280
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:40,320
我們在慕尚直道上跑出了350公里的時速
we clocked 218 miles an hour down the Mulsanne Straight.

1281
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:44,200
雖然恩佐老頭有多年賽車經歷
Now, in all his years of racing...

1282
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:48,620
他也沒見過能跑這么快的車
old Enzo ain't never seen anything move that fast.

1283
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:50,990
現在他明白了
And now he knows...

1284
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:52,790
毫無疑問
without a doubt...

1285
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,290
我們的車要比他的快
we're faster than he is...

1286
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:01,550
哪怕是我們派錯了車手上場
even with the wrong driver...

1287
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:04,090
還存在官僚主義
and all the committees.

1288
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:07,930
他此時此刻
And that's what he's thinking about

1289
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:11,850
坐在意大利摩德納想的就是這件事
while he's sitting in Modena, Italy... right now.

1290
01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:15,850
那家伙現在嚇壞了
That man is scared to death...

1291
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:19,830
他怕您今年會變得足夠明智
that this year you actually might be smart enough

1292
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:21,070
開始信任我
to start trusting me.

1293
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:25,190
沒錯
So, yeah...

1294
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:30,160
您完全擺布了法拉利
I'd say you got Ferrari exactly where you want him.

1295
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:34,950
不用謝
You're welcome.

1296
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:53,810
過來
Come here.

1297
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,280
看到那座小建筑了嗎
See that little building down there?

1298
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:06,030
二戰期間
In World War II...

1299
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:10,490
五分之三的美國轟炸機在那里生產
three out of five US bombers rolled off that line.

1300
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,990
你以為打敗希特勒的是羅斯福嗎
You think Roosevelt beat Hitler?

1301
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:17,540
再好好想想
Think again.

1302
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,080
這不是福特汽車公司
This isn't the first time

1303
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:21,460
第一次上歐洲戰場了
Ford Motor's gone to war in Europe.

1304
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,710
我們會做的可不只是擺弄文件
We know how to do more than push paper.

1305
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,010
這家公司只有一個老大
And there is one man running this company.

1306
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,640
你直接向他匯報
You report to him.

1307
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,220
明白了嗎
You understand me?

1308
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:38,980
是  先生
Yes, sir.

1309
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:43,110
去吧  卡羅爾  準備作戰
Go ahead, Carroll. Go to war.

1310
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:47,030
謝謝您  先生
Thank you, sir.

1311
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:21,720
你說得沒錯
You were right.

1312
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:23,360
就是變速箱的問題
It's the gearbox.

1313
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:25,410
我們開得太心急了
We ran too hot.

1314
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:28,310
四個里面壞了三個
Three out of four of 'em broke.

1315
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,310
拉桿也弄壞了另一個
The rod blew on the other one.

1316
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:36,700
我們要重回賽場了  肯
We're going back, Ken.

1317
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:44,020
他們說這次歸我全權負責
They told me I had "Carte blanche" this time.

1318
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:48,220
我查了下  這是法語"胡說八道"的意思
I looked it up. It's French for "Horseshit."

1319
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:50,440
我知道他們肯定還會想盡一切辦法
I know they're gonna squeeze our nuts any way they can

1320
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,040
來打壓我們
soon as they work out how.

1321
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,300
那個...
Well, the, uh...

1322
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:56,680
我買的冰淇淋要化了
ice cream's melting.

1323
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,250
好吧  肯
All right. Hey, Ken.

1324
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:04,100
你是想讓我道歉嗎
You want me to apologize?

1325
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,710
要我求你嗎
You want me to beg?

1326
01:13:08,710 --> 01:13:10,570
我也不知道  可以試試
I don't know. Let's try it out.

1327
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:12,920
你先試了再說
Let's, uh, see how that feels.

1328
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:20,450
肯  對不起
Ken, I'm sorry.

1329
01:13:21,550 --> 01:13:22,900
真心的
Sincerely.

1330
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,450
你知道我為了能讓賽車上跑道
Do you have any idea the kind of shit that I had to eat

1331
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:31,430
受了多少臉色嗎
just to get four wheels on that grid?

1332
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:32,020
你不知道
No, you don't.

1333
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:34,120
因為你完全不用為那些事操心
'Cause you don't deal with any of that stuff.

1334
01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:36,190
所以別磨嘰了  肯  我們還有正事要做
Now knock it off, Ken. We got work to do,

1335
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:38,130
車又不是從天上掉下來的
and this car ain't gonna build itself.

1336
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:48,600
好  行吧
Okay. All right.

1337
01:13:58,830 --> 01:14:00,100
天啊
God.

1338
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:02,970
給我過來
Come here.

1339
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,450
-你他媽就一賣車的  -媽的
- Bloody car salesman. - Shit!

1340
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:10,860
來啊  吃我一記
Come on. Now you're gonna get it.

1341
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:16,930
松手
Get off me!

1342
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:21,260
固執的王八蛋
Stubborn son of a bitch.

1343
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:23,880
天啊
God!

1344
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,140
-看好了  -來啊
- You just look... - Right.

1345
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,220
-怎么樣  -你...
- Yeah, now. - You...

1346
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:31,590
你還好嗎
You all right?

1347
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:32,940
媽的
Shit!

1348
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:36,300
看我不收拾你
Now you're gonna get it.

1349
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:38,710
給我過來
Come here.

1350
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:43,850
完事
Done.

1351
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:49,820
莫莉  親愛的
Mollie, darling.

1352
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:51,670
怎么了  老公
Yes, love?

1353
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:53,610
能給我拿瓶汽水嗎
Can I get a fizzy pop, please?

1354
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,030
好的
Yes, love.

1355
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:59,160
你要嗎  謝爾比
You want one, too, Shelby?

1356
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,240
-別給他  -好  謝了莫莉
- No. No. - Uh, yes, please, Mollie.

1357
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,500
別給他  他自己買去
No. He can get his own.

1358
01:15:03,650 --> 01:15:05,350
只給我拿就行了
Just for me, please.

1359
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:13,280
上次干架是什么時候來著
How long has that been?

1360
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,170
至少得有三四年了
Oh, it's gotta be three or four years, at least.

1361
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:18,400
對  在加州河濱市
Right. Riverside.

1362
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,490
嗯  美國賽車俱樂部區域錦標賽
Yeah. SCCA Divisional Championship.

1363
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,440
你把我手指弄斷了
You broke my finger.

1364
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:29,180
你抓著我手臂
What's that nippy bloody thing

1365
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:30,870
扯奶頭那一招是什么來頭
you do under the arm, that thing?

1366
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,700
我叫那招"羊駝咬奶"
Yeah. I call that the Llama Bite.

1367
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:34,120
你還取了個名字
You name it?

1368
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:37,910
你從哪學來的  女童子軍嗎
Where'd you learn that? The Girl Scouts?

1369
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:40,440
-怎么  你想再試一次嗎  -給你
- What? You wanna go again? - Here you go.

1370
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:42,470
你真好
You're an angel.

1371
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:43,550
謝謝
Thank you.

1372
01:15:43,550 --> 01:15:45,010
不客氣
My pleasure.

1373
01:15:45,770 --> 01:15:48,300
好了  我準備去趟雜貨店
Right. Well, I'm about to go to the grocery store.

1374
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,030
要給你們帶什么東西嗎
Anything you think you'll need?

1375
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:52,800
冰淇淋
Um, ice cream.

1376
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,720
冰淇淋就不錯  還要...
Ice cream would be good and, uh...

1377
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,180
面包
bread.

1378
01:15:58,740 --> 01:15:59,750
好
Right.

1379
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,540
我不用  謝謝
No, I'm good. Thank you.

1380
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:03,720
謝謝  莫
Thanks, Moll.

1381
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:06,580
你還吃這藥治心臟病呢
You still take those for your ticker?

1382
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,580
我是因為好吃才吃的
Only 'cause they're so delicious.

1383
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:11,670
-去你的  -滾吧
- Up yours. - Oh, go to hell.

1384
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:22,270
跑起來  加把勁  加把勁
Come on. Giddy-up. Giddy-up. Giddy-up.

1385
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:40,390
菲爾  這是你的  哥們
Phil! Here's the one for you, mate.

1386
01:16:40,390 --> 01:16:41,910
迪諾  過來
Dino, come here.

1387
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:00,670
怎么樣
Well?

1388
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:02,880
踩油門還是會有滯后感
There's still lag when I hit the gas.

1389
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,410
把真空次級化油器換了吧
Let's get rid of the vacuum secondaries.

1390
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:05,840
查理  拿霍利化油器來
Charlie, get a Holley carb.

1391
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,890
我們要重新裝配油門總成
We're gonna rebuild the throttle assembly.

1392
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:09,270
離迪通拿耐力賽只剩三周時間了
Three weeks to Daytona,

1393
01:17:09,270 --> 01:17:12,510
這車還是問題百出
and it still feels like a bag of squirrels.

1394
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:13,910
剎車過熱
Brake heat.

1395
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,600
那完全又是另一碼事了
That's a whole different ball game.

1396
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,270
好了  彼得  來跟我溜一圈
All right, Petey, let's go for that ride.

1397
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,230
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1398
01:17:29,630 --> 01:17:31,220
看到那條縫了嗎
You see that crack?

1399
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:33,160
那是我過八號彎的記號
That's my marker for turn eight.

1400
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,440
做什么的  提醒你減速嗎
What, to slow down?

1401
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:41,480
輕踩剎車  換低檔
Brush the brakes and downshift.

1402
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:45,970
但你到時候會跑到時速240多公里
But you'll be going 150 miles an hour.

1403
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:47,830
沒錯
Yeah.

1404
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:49,530
那你怎么看得見呢
So how do you see it?

1405
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,870
速度是很快  但車在加速的時候
You're going fast, but as the car speeds up...

1406
01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:55,440
周圍的一切都會隨之變慢
everything else slows down.

1407
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,410
不能這么看
You don't do that.

1408
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,080
視線要開闊點  對嗎
You do this. Right?

1409
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,050
這樣你就能看到一切
And then you see everything.

1410
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,410
你還留了別的記號嗎
Do you set other markers?

1411
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:09,030
那是當然
Indeed I do.

1412
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:11,680
還留了很多
Lots of them.

1413
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:15,720
知道了  因為我們不能
Yeah, 'cause you can't just

1414
01:18:15,730 --> 01:18:18,030
全程都把賽車逼得太緊  對嗎
push the car hard the whole way, right?

1415
01:18:18,030 --> 01:18:20,850
沒錯  你得善待賽車
That's right. You have to be kind to the car.

1416
01:18:20,850 --> 01:18:25,300
你會感覺到這個小可憐在你身下呻吟
You feel the poor thing groaning underneath you.

1417
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:29,890
如果你想將一臺機器推向極致
If you're gonna push a piece of machinery to the limit

1418
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:31,720
還指望著它不會散架
and expect it to hold together,

1419
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:35,980
那你就得感覺到它的極限在哪里
you have to have some sense of where that limit is.

1420
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:40,680
看前方
Look out there.

1421
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:44,190
那就是完美的一圈
Out there is the perfect lap.

1422
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,890
毫無差錯
No mistakes.

1423
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:51,060
每次換檔  每次過彎
Every gear change, every corner...

1424
01:18:52,170 --> 01:18:53,540
都恰到好處
perfect.

1425
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,280
你看到了嗎
You see it?

1426
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:01,840
應該看到了
I think so.

1427
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:05,140
很多人都看不到
Most people can't.

1428
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:09,390
很多人甚至都不知道它的存在  但它就在那
Most people don't even know it's out there, but it is.

1429
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:12,800
就在眼前
It's there.

1430
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,210
你想吃冰淇淋嗎
You want some ice cream?

1431
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,430
-好啊  -行
- Yeah. - All right.

1432
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:23,400
我們走
Come on, then.

1433
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:25,250
你知道這是什么記號嗎
Do you know what this marker is?

1434
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:26,340
-什么  -那個
- What? - That one.

1435
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:28,260
扯我手指  你就知道了
Pull my finger. You'll find out.

1436
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:52,090
他還要多久才進站
How much longer before he comes in?

1437
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:54,790
我們每四個小時換一次車手
Uh, well, we change drivers every four hours,

1438
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,730
-大概還要十分鐘  -不  等等
- so about 10 minutes. - No, hang on.

1439
01:19:56,730 --> 01:19:59,160
你的意思是現在由畢比全權負責了
You're saying Beebe is 100 percent in charge now?

1440
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:01,450
沒錯  他想讓邁爾斯走人
Yes, and he wants Miles gone.

1441
01:20:01,610 --> 01:20:03,740
聽著  他擺明了是在針對他
Look, it's personal with this guy.

1442
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:06,030
而且他確實有和你對著干的資本
And, yes, he has the leverage to stick it to you.

1443
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:07,840
他和大魔王明天就坐飛機過去
He and the Deuce are flying there tomorrow.

1444
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:08,980
他到時候會當面告訴你
He's gonna tell you in person.

1445
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:11,140
他現在就等著你失控發飆了
Now, all he is hoping for is that you lose your cool.

1446
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,570
是時候妥協了
It's time to let this go.

1447
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:15,000
你不能葬送全局
You cannot destroy the whole thing.

1448
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,340
不能為了這區區一個人
Not for one goddamn guy.

1449
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:18,200
-我當然可以  -有什么必要呢
- Sure, I can. - Well, why?

1450
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,470
因為在我們說話這會
'Cause while we're here talking,

1451
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:21,260
他正在外頭做實事
he's out there getting it done.

1452
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:31,120
糟了
Oh, shit!

1453
01:20:32,110 --> 01:20:33,710
他剎車失靈了
He's got brake fade.

1454
01:20:40,990 --> 01:20:42,460
慢點
Ease off!

1455
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:53,560
卡羅爾
Carroll?

1456
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:54,960
-快救他出來  -彼得
- Get him out! - Peter!

1457
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,570
別站這  快進去
Go on. Go inside.

1458
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:57,750
待在這里別動
Just stay there.

1459
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:59,210
-快救肯  -肯
- Get Ken! - Ken!

1460
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:00,700
快救他出來
Get him out!

1461
01:21:02,370 --> 01:21:03,440
他在這里
There he is!

1462
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:04,850
肯
Ken!

1463
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,120
我看到他了
I can see him.

1464
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:13,880
-肯  -快點
- Ken! - Come on.

1465
01:21:20,270 --> 01:21:21,740
剎車
The brakes.

1466
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:33,920
把這破發動機拆了行嗎
Let's just rip out the damn engine. All right?

1467
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,600
無法制動的話要它有什么用
We can't use it if we can't stop.

1468
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,340
我們要是悠著點開
You know, the brakes would last longer

1469
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:40,030
剎車還是能撐一會的
if we slowed down a bit.

1470
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:42,670
那不就違背要給車加動力的初衷了嗎
Wouldn't that defeat the whole purpose of the extra power?

1471
01:21:43,450 --> 01:21:44,520
我還以為我們在這里這么努力
You know, I thought the whole point

1472
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,260
是為了拿下比賽呢
was to win the damned race.

1473
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:48,830
要不我們重新設計總成
Maybe we could design a new assembly.

1474
01:21:48,830 --> 01:21:52,810
我們在進站時不要僅僅更換剎車片
Instead of swapping out the pads in the pits...

1475
01:21:52,910 --> 01:21:55,480
而是換掉整個剎車系統
swap out the entire braking system.

1476
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,120
包括剎車盤
Rotors included.

1477
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:59,200
換上一個新的
Put in a fresh one.

1478
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,900
等等  等等  老爹
Wait, wait, wait, Pops,

1479
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:02,330
我們能那么做嗎
are we allowed to do that?

1480
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:05,220
不知道  我看不懂法語
I don't know. I don't read French.

1481
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:08,040
{\an8}勒芒24小時耐力賽
賽車場指南

1482
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:11,690
剎車也是"一種零件"  對吧
Well, brakes are "a part" like any other, right?

1483
01:22:11,690 --> 01:22:14,290
我們可以換零件
We are allowed to change parts.

1484
01:22:14,290 --> 01:22:16,230
沒錯  但有時間換嗎
Yes. Will we have time to do that?

1485
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,020
我還不知道  查理
I don't know yet, Charlie.

1486
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:20,150
我要帶他回家了
I'm gonna take him home.

1487
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:21,490
好
All right.

1488
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:22,650
解決這破事
Sort this shit out.

1489
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:23,970
我會的
I will.

1490
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:35,630
你身上著過火嗎
Have you ever been on fire?

1491
01:22:38,530 --> 01:22:41,590
沒有  我沒遇到過這種情況
Well, no, it's never happened to me.

1492
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:48,540
不過賽車服是防火的  知道嗎
But the suit's flameproof, see?

1493
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:50,700
它能隔熱
It keeps heat out.

1494
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,240
好吧
Yeah.

1495
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:58,180
但路易斯-埃文斯在摩洛哥大獎賽中被燒死
But Lewis-Evans burned to death in the Moroccan Grand Prix.

1496
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:00,290
他也穿了防火賽車服
He had a flameproof suit on.

1497
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:04,120
沒錯  但是...
Yeah, but...

1498
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:08,750
他被卡住了
See, he got stuck.

1499
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:10,310
無法呼吸
He couldn't breathe.

1500
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:14,910
只要人下了車  就沒事
So, as long as you get out of the car, you're okay.

1501
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:20,200
爸爸下了車
Dad got out.

1502
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:23,810
-確實  -彼得
- He sure did. - Peter!

1503
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:28,900
再見
Bye.

1504
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:30,510
再見
See ya.

1505
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:34,950
-你沒事吧  -沒事
- You all right? - Yeah.

1506
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:37,390
你怎么回事
What's wrong with you?

1507
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:39,580
別跟我說剎車
And don't be telling me brakes

1508
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:42,000
或者我差點一命嗚呼什么的
or me almost kicking the bucket out there.

1509
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,520
跟那些穿西裝的人有關  對吧
It's something to do with the suits, isn't it?

1510
01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:48,260
都在控制之中
It's under control.

1511
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,670
怎么了
What is it?

1512
01:23:49,710 --> 01:23:51,500
我們說過你做好你的事
You know how we talked about how you do your thing,

1513
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:52,540
我做好我的事
I do my thing?

1514
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:53,810
-這是我的事  -說真的  謝爾...
- This is my thing. - Really, Shel...

1515
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:55,590
相信我  肯
Just trust me, Ken.

1516
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:57,570
你有計劃嗎
You got a plan?

1517
01:23:58,260 --> 01:23:59,710
必須的
Absolutely.

1518
01:24:00,010 --> 01:24:01,430
好計劃嗎
It a good one?

1519
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:03,350
風險很高
It's high risk.

1520
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:04,680
有多高
How high risk?

1521
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,380
極其高
Extremely high risk.

1522
01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:09,530
了不起
Well, that's something.

1523
01:24:10,030 --> 01:24:12,090
-很高興我們談了  -隨時再聊
- Glad we had this talk. - Anytime.

1524
01:24:24,410 --> 01:24:26,850
福特先生  真是驚喜
Mr. Ford, this is a surprise.

1525
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:30,190
抱歉擅自前來  謝爾比先生
Apologies for the unannounced intrusion, Mr. Shelby,

1526
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:33,450
但是我付了九百萬造汽車
but when a man pays $9 million for an automobile,

1527
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:35,310
起碼應該能看看長什么樣
he ought to at least be able to see it.

1528
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:36,980
聽起來很合理
Well, that sounds reasonable enough.

1529
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:38,810
謝爾比  能和你談一下嗎
Shelby, could I have a word?

1530
01:24:38,910 --> 01:24:40,200
當然
Sure.

1531
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:42,060
-私下談嗎  -是的
- In private? - Yeah.

1532
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:43,700
那樣更好
That would be preferable.

1533
01:24:43,710 --> 01:24:44,920
好吧  菲爾
All right. Hey, Phil.

1534
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,730
你能招呼一下福特先生嗎
You wanna take care of Mr. Ford here?

1535
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:48,610
福特先生  他是菲爾·雷明頓
Mr. Ford, that's Phil Remington.

1536
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:49,400
當然
Of course.

1537
01:24:49,410 --> 01:24:50,600
來我辦公室  里奧
Come up to my office, Leo.

1538
01:24:50,610 --> 01:24:51,920
-幸會  先生  -菲爾
- Pleasure to meet you, sir. - Phil.

1539
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:54,020
我帶您參觀一下您的車
Give you a little tour of your car.

1540
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:58,010
我們拿掉了289小發動機
We took out your 289 small block...

1541
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:01,350
換上了7L的427發動機
and put in a 427 7-liter.

1542
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:06,260
首先  我想消除誤會
Firstly, I want to just clear the air.

1543
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:08,940
希望我們之間的分歧
I hope that whatever disagreements between us

1544
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:10,150
能歸結于...
can just be chalked up to...

1545
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:13,740
激烈爭論時自然而然的血氣方剛
natural red-bloodedness in the heat of battle.

1546
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:16,710
感謝你這么說  里奧  真的
I appreciate that, Leo. Truly, I do.

1547
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:21,310
謝爾比  我有責任通知你
It falls on me, Shelby, to inform you that

1548
01:25:21,310 --> 01:25:25,660
我被任命為賽車項目的執行總監
I have been appointed overall executive director of the racing program.

1549
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:31,020
我真心希望這不會成為我們之間的問題
Now, I do hope that this won't be a problem between us.

1550
01:25:31,610 --> 01:25:33,810
里奧  我向你保證  不會的
Well, I assure you, Leo, it will not.

1551
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:45,500
卡羅爾
Carroll...

1552
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:46,590
卡羅爾

1553
01:25:46,590 --> 01:25:49,210
427發動機的最高速是多少
And what is that top speed with the 427?

1554
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:51,050
不如我們開一圈
Well, why don't we take it for a spin?

1555
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,830
-什么  -來吧  福特先生
- What? - Yeah, go on, Mr. Ford.

- Hop on in. Go on. - You want me to...

1557
01:25:55,670 --> 01:25:58,060
感覺一下九百萬的車是什么樣
Just see what $9 million feels like.

1558
01:25:59,930 --> 01:26:01,180
老天
God...

1559
01:26:04,930 --> 01:26:06,270
把門打開
Open the door!

1560
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:07,870
把門打開
Open the door!

1561
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:09,880
把門打開
Open the door!

1562
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:13,590
你扶著我這里
Just hold me right there,

1563
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:14,990
你抓住我的手
and you take my hand.

1564
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:19,640
天啊  我坐到了蛋蛋
Oh, God. I sat on my nuts.

1565
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:22,230
下一輛車我們會改進舒適感  別擔心
We're gonna build the next one for comfort. Don't you worry.

1566
01:26:31,530 --> 01:26:33,320
-打開門  -抱歉  先生  稍等一下
- Open the door. - Sorry, sir, if you just give me a moment.

1567
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,800
-打開門  -這門不好開
- Open the door. - It's a sticky one.

1568
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:36,560
準備好了嗎
You ready?

1569
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:38,400
方向盤中間那名字應該能讓你知道
The name on the middle of that steering wheel should tell you

1570
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,710
我生來就準備好了  謝爾比  出發
that I was born ready, Shelby. Hit it.

1571
01:26:40,710 --> 01:26:41,440
好樣的
Attaboy.

1572
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:47,760
這車推背感挺強  是吧
It's got a little kick, doesn't it?

1573
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:50,270
-打開門  -好了
- Open this door. - There we go.

1574
01:26:50,270 --> 01:26:52,420
天吶  畢比先生  你還好嗎
Good God, Mr. Beebe. You okay, sir?

1575
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:56,350
天啊
Oh, my God!

1576
01:26:58,190 --> 01:27:00,770
天啊  天啊
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1577
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:05,800
棒極了
Yeah, baby.

1578
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,380
棒極了
Yeah, baby.

1579
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:15,800
差不多就是這會外行會嚇得尿褲子
It's about right now the uninitiated have a tendency to soil themselves.

1580
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,650
天啊
Oh, my God!

1581
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:03,230
福特先生

福特先生
Mr. Ford...

1584

真沒想到
I had no idea.

1586
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,370
真沒想到
I had no idea.

1587
01:28:22,990 --> 01:28:24,650
我真希望我爸爸

1588
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:26,840
能活著看到這個
he were alive to see this.

1589

感受這個

1590
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:34,570
這不是一臺隨便誰都能進來輕松掌控的車
Now, this is not a machine just anybody can get in and easily control.

1591
01:28:34,570 --> 01:28:36,230
絕對不是
Absolutely not.

1592
01:28:36,570 --> 01:28:37,770
真沒想到
I had no idea.

01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:39,490
您想贏得勒芒賽

肯·邁爾斯就是你的人選

1596
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:53,700
來得真巧
Good timing.

1597
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,540
他了解這車  因為是他幫我造的
Now, he knows this car because he helped me build it.

1598
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:01,540
謝爾比  你知道我已經任命里奧·畢比
Shelby, you know I've already appointed Leo Beebe

1599
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:04,400
-為賽車總監  -正因如此我才和您談
- director of racing. - Which is exactly why I'm talking to you.

1600
01:29:05,210 --> 01:29:08,180
您讓肯·邁爾斯在迪通拿耐力賽上場
Now, you let Ken Miles race Daytona.

1601
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:10,150
如果他贏了

1602
01:29:10,910 --> 01:29:12,580
他就在勒芒賽上場
he gets to drive Le Mans.

1603
01:29:15,130 --> 01:29:16,820
如果他沒贏呢

over the Holman-Moody Ford driven by Walt Hansgen.

1611

我可不那么認為  沃爾特
I don't bloody think so, Walt.

1612
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,190
這場比賽不只是對我們車輛的測驗
This race is not just a test of our cars,

1613
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:05,710
也是對我們團隊的測驗

1650
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,560
-燃油不足  -拿鏟子
- Fuel's low. - Bring up the scoop.

1651
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,030
溫度有點高
She's hot.

1652
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:48,000
你好  沃爾特  很高興見到你
Hey there, Walt. Good to see you.

1653
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,690
等我開出這里  謝爾比
Yeah, after I get out of this pit, Shelby,

1654
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:50,790
你就高興不起來了
it's the last time you will.

1655
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:52,160
不用擔心
Don't worry.

1656
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:53,930
我們有后視鏡
We got rearview mirrors.

1657
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,750
被他逼出賽道的野馬怎么樣了
What happened to that Mustang he took out?

1658
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:58,600
還不知道
Don't know yet.

1659
01:31:58,790 --> 01:32:01,640
我可以開到六千轉以上  謝爾
I can push her harder than six, Shel.

1660
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:02,510
我能感覺到
I can feel it.

1661
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:11,480
為什么這些人檢修加油比我們快這么多
How come these guys pit so much faster than we do?

1662
01:32:11,650 --> 01:32:15,090
因為他們有納斯卡車賽團隊
They got a goddamn NASCAR crew, that's why.

1663
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:17,160
-不是吧  -是的
- No shit? - No shit.

1664
01:32:17,590 --> 01:32:19,330
快  快
Go! Go, come on.

1665
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,430
可以了  可以了
We're clear, we're clear.

1666
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:23,640
該死的納斯卡車賽團隊
Goddamn NASCAR crew.

1667
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:25,150
出發  出發
Go, go, go!

1668
01:32:25,770 --> 01:32:27,830
伙計們  他們已經離開了
Guys, they've already left.

1669
01:32:30,110 --> 01:32:31,240
喂
Hello?

1670
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:33,400
我的莫莉  你好
There's my Mollie. Hello.

1671
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:35,100
你好  親愛的
Hiya, love.

1672
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:37,010
-媽媽  媽媽  -你在做什么
- Mom? Mom? - What are you doing?

1673
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:38,290
在喝茶
Just having a cuppa.

1674
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:40,070
媽媽  問他剎車的情況
Mom, ask him about the brakes.

1675
01:32:40,070 --> 01:32:42,260
-去睡覺  已經凌晨一點了  -問他
- Go to bed. It's 1:00 a.M. - Ask him.

1676
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:43,840
去睡覺  馬上
Go to bed. Now.

1677
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,740
我猜他還沒睡
I take it he's not asleep.

1678
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:47,470
他肯定偷偷拿了收音機
I'm sure he smuggled in a radio.

1679
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:48,800
是啊
Yeah.

1680
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:50,620
他讓我問  "剎車怎么樣了"
He said to ask, "How are the brakes?"

1681
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:52,180
剎車  對  沒事
The brakes? Yes. No, no, no.

1682
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:54,530
告訴他  剎車暫時還能用
Tell him they're working for now.

1683
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:57,390
謝爾比一直表現得很奇怪
You know, Shelby's been acting very strange.

1684
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:58,470
-福特已經去  -肯
- Ford have gone... - Ken.

1685
01:32:58,470 --> 01:32:59,870
組建了另一支隊伍
and put up another team.

1686
01:32:59,870 --> 01:33:00,870
-開一輛GT  -肯
- With a GT. - Ken.

1687
01:33:00,870 --> 01:33:03,660
某種愚蠢的狗屁公司測試之類的
Some sort of yampy, bloody corporate test or something.

1688
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:04,280
我不知道  但是...
I don't know, but...

1689
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:06,640
有機會的話就休息一會
Just take a rest whenever you get a chance.

1690
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:08,120
抱歉  親愛的  你說什么
Sorry, my love, what were you saying?

1691
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:09,550
你只有幾個小時了
You've only got a few hours.

1692
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:10,980
我聽不太清楚
I can't hear you very well.

1693
01:33:10,990 --> 01:33:12,330
抱歉  我聽不清
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.

1694
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:13,560
祝我好運吧
Wish me luck.

1695
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:15,520
-祝你好運  -我愛你  親愛的
- Good luck. - I love you, darling.

1696
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:18,250
迪通拿耐力賽已經進行了23小時
After 23 hours here at Daytona,

1697
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:20,810
駕駛著綠白色福特的沃爾特·漢斯根
Walt Hansgen driving the green and white Ford

1698
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:24,700
遙遙領先肯·邁爾斯和謝爾比美國車隊
has a commanding lead over Ken Miles and Shelby American

1699
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:27,650
其他選手都已經落下一大截
as the rest of the field has fallen off the pace.

1700
01:33:27,650 --> 01:33:29,070
我們輸定了
We're locked out.

1701
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:31,710
比賽到這階段邁爾斯也無能為力了
Ain't nothing Miles can do this late in the race.

1702
01:33:32,270 --> 01:33:35,070
發動機過熱  我們要把轉速壓在六千以下
Engine's hot. We gotta keep it under six thou.

1703
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:21,120
{\an8}上到七千轉
拼命沖刺

1704
01:34:22,530 --> 01:34:24,340
好啊
All right.

1705
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:51,160
車可能會散架的
She could come apart.

1706
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:52,740
不試試怎么知道
One way to find out.

1707
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:58,140
我們不是讓他別超過六千轉嗎
I thought we were keeping him under 6,000?

1708
01:34:58,410 --> 01:34:59,940
閉嘴  唐
Shut up, Don.

1709
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:11,820
迪通拿耐力賽僅剩下最后幾分鐘
With only minutes of racing left here at Daytona,

1710
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:14,020
爭奪第一名的決戰突然打響
a pitched battle for the lead is being waged

1711
01:35:14,020 --> 01:35:16,810
福特98號在比賽的最后發起驚人的沖刺
as the number 98 Ford makes an incredible late surge.

1712
01:35:16,810 --> 01:35:18,940
-怎么了  -他在加速
- What's happening? - He's moving up.

1713
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:20,490
進入了前部三角環道
...entering the front tri-oval,

1714
01:35:20,490 --> 01:35:22,990
肯·邁爾斯志在奪冠的最后一搏可能會...
Ken Miles' desperate bid for the win may prove to be...

1715
01:35:31,370 --> 01:35:32,160
加油
Come on now!

1716
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:34,340
白旗  最后一圈
White flag! Last lap!

1717
01:35:39,670 --> 01:35:41,930
邁爾斯把他逼得很緊
Miles is pushing him. Hard.

1718
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:54,480
就是這樣  寶貝
That's it, girl.

1719
01:36:04,730 --> 01:36:06,590
肯·邁爾斯緊跟沃爾特·漢斯根
Ken Miles drafts Walt Hansgen

1720
01:36:06,590 --> 01:36:08,360
進入了最后一個彎道
coming into the final turn.

1721
01:36:34,710 --> 01:36:35,980
快呀  快呀
Come on. Come on.

1722
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,920
搞什么
What the hell?

1723
01:36:48,940 --> 01:36:49,830
加油
Come on.

1724
01:36:50,770 --> 01:36:52,010
好了
All right.

1725
01:36:56,190 --> 01:36:57,970
好好看著吧
Look at this now.

1726
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:03,900
媽的
Damn it!

1727
01:37:13,170 --> 01:37:15,360
肯·邁爾斯奪得第一
Ken Miles takes the checkered flag,

1728
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:17,830
為謝爾比美國車隊爭得榮耀
bringing glory to Shelby American.

1729
01:37:20,690 --> 01:37:21,890
怎么樣啊
How about that?

1730
01:37:31,910 --> 01:37:33,090
可靠性  強度...
Reliability, strength...

1731
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:34,760
喂  里奧
Yes, Leo.

1732
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:36,850
福特先生  我們贏了
Mr. Ford, sir, we won.

1733
01:37:38,940 --> 01:37:41,250
我們贏了  福特贏了迪通拿耐力賽
We won! Ford won Daytona.

1734
01:37:41,250 --> 01:37:42,460
太好了
Hot damn.

1735
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,020
哪支隊贏了  里奧
And which team was it, Leo?

1736
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:48,820
謝爾比美國車隊  車手是邁爾斯
Shelby American. Miles driving.

1737
01:37:50,370 --> 01:37:51,930
這混蛋
Son of a bitch.

1738
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:53,410
好了
All right.

1739
01:37:54,270 --> 01:37:55,470
他到底去哪了
Where the hell is he?

1740
01:37:55,610 --> 01:37:57,870
等等  我看見他了  等下
Hang on, I see him. Hey, wait.

1741
01:37:57,870 --> 01:38:00,440
有人在沙灘上走失一條斗牛犬
Someone lost a bulldog on the beach.

1742
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:03,590
別別  快來吧
No, no. Come on. Come on.

1743
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:07,630
快來  來來來
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1744
01:38:07,630 --> 01:38:10,550
快把酒給他  把酒給他
Someone get this man a drink. Someone get him a drink.

1745
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:30,770
快睡覺  你在做什么呢
In bed, you. What are you doing?

1746
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:32,820
夜貓子
Dirty stop out.

1747
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:34,060
我是在...
I was...

1748
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:37,970
畫地圖  這樣就能知道你在勒芒的賽況
drawing a map, so I could follow you on Le Mans.

1749
01:38:42,090 --> 01:38:43,310
看看
Look at that.

1750
01:38:44,730 --> 01:38:46,430
畫得完全正確
That is spot on.

1751
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:49,070
你真是高手  非常準確
You are a dab hand, very accurate.

1752
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,100
跟我說說賽道吧
Tell me about the track.

1753
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:53,810
不行  彼得
No, I can't, Petey.

1754
01:38:54,290 --> 01:38:55,530
求你了
Please.

1755
01:39:03,740 --> 01:39:06,110
從起點線出發
Well, you start at the start line.

1756
01:39:06,510 --> 01:39:08,490
對  但你其實是從這里出發的
Yeah, but you actually start here

1757
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:10,610
因為在勒芒賽你得跑向你的車
because you have to run to your car at Le Mans.

1758
01:39:10,610 --> 01:39:11,710
沒錯
True enough.

1759
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:15,670
一旦你老爸成功挪過去
So, once your old man manages to hobble over...

1760
01:39:15,970 --> 01:39:18,440
-把車開出來  -還沒撞到別的車
- and pull out... - And not hit anyone.

1761
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:20,020
對  沒錯
Yes, right.

1762
01:39:21,290 --> 01:39:25,580
然后就要全力加速開往鄧洛普橋
Then you accelerate very hard up to Dunlop Bridge...

1763
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:27,670
路向一邊傾斜
road banking away from ya

1764
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:30,650
經過樹叢就到了埃索斯連續彎
and down through the trees to the Esses...

1765
01:39:30,650 --> 01:39:32,830
再加速進入特魯熱加速彎
and accelerate up to Tertre Rouge.

1766
01:39:32,830 --> 01:39:35,390
這是個關鍵的一檔彎
Critical first gear corner.

1767
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:36,960
快速入彎
Fast entry.

1768
01:39:37,210 --> 01:39:40,110
保持高速出彎  進入...
Keep your speed up for your exit onto...

1769
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:42,290
慕尚直道
Mulsanne.

1770
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:45,560
這是一段很長的直路  被白楊簇擁著
Long straightaway, hemmed in by poplars.

1771
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:49,120
掛最高檔  開到時速338公里
Top gear, 210 miles per hour.

1772
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:51,360
然后退到三檔  提高轉速
And down to third, revs up.

1773
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,240
轉速就是你的朋友
Revs are your friend.

1774
01:39:53,670 --> 01:39:57,220
最遠距離入彎  讓車空檔滑行
Get a maximum exit. Let the car run free.

1775
01:39:57,220 --> 01:39:59,220
經過坡頂
Over the brow...

1776
01:39:59,370 --> 01:40:00,120
然后...
then...

1777
01:40:02,090 --> 01:40:03,600
經過慕尚彎
Mulsanne Corner.

1778
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:06,120
一路加速到雅致彎
Accelerate to Arnage

1779
01:40:06,130 --> 01:40:07,660
然后爬坡至白屋彎
and then over the rise to the White House.

1780
01:40:07,660 --> 01:40:10,190
過好這個彎...
You get that right and...

1781
01:40:12,970 --> 01:40:15,450
24小時比賽里的第一個三分半
your first three and a half minutes...

1782
01:40:16,170 --> 01:40:17,980
就過去了
of 24 hours.

1783
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:25,810
但是  你沒法做到每圈都很完美
But... you can't make every lap perfect.

1784
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:28,040
但我可以盡力
But I can try.

1785
01:40:33,670 --> 01:40:34,570
好了
All right.

1786
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:37,260
快上床睡覺了
Off to bed, you.

1787
01:40:40,050 --> 01:40:43,290
我會先來叫醒你

1788
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:45,830
然后再動身去法國

1789
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:47,030
我保證
I promise.

1792
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:22,620
圣皮埃爾大酒店怎么走

1793
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:24,900
哪里
Where?

1794
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:13,660
明天還會再下雨的
It's gonna rain again tomorrow.

1795
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:20,660
這里成天下雨
There's always rain here.

1796
01:42:23,850 --> 01:42:25,550
但開賽時沒有雨
Start'll be dry though,

1797
01:42:25,550 --> 01:42:29,120
所以等下雨了我們再幫你換輪胎
so we'll swap out your tires come rain.

1798
01:42:31,470 --> 01:42:32,350
好

1799
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:40,040
你還是好好睡一覺比較好  斗牛犬

1800
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:42,960
你也一樣

1801
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:45,170
又不是我開車
I'm not driving.

1802
01:42:47,850 --> 01:42:51,330
那還真是可惜了
That's a bloody shame, that.

1803
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:53,590
我沒那技術
Oh, hell, I couldn't make this team.

1804
01:42:58,410 --> 01:43:00,470
我要走到第一個彎道
I'm gonna go walk the first corner.

1805

1806

1811
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:10,030
如果這是選美大賽的話
Well, if this were a beauty pageant...

1812
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:12,050
我們已經輸了
we just lost.

1813
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:14,300
看起來跑得挺快  不是嗎
Looks fast, don't it?

1814
01:44:14,870 --> 01:44:16,520
外表可說明不了一切
Looks aren't everything.

1815
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:23,620
法拉利是斯卡費奧提和班蒂尼開賽

01:53:06,420 --> 01:53:08,100
給我拿一只秒表
Hey, I need a stopwatch.

1924
01:53:10,420 --> 01:53:17,680
{\an8}24小時的賽程已過八小時  法拉利車隊包攬前二

1925
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:29,010
{\an2}{\pos(192,245)}看到了嗎  那位美國汽車工業巨頭坐直升機走了  真是高級

1926
01:53:37,910 --> 01:53:39,510
法拉利車隊的洛倫佐·班迪尼
Lorenzo Bandini remains

1927
01:53:39,510 --> 01:53:42,260
仍然占據第一
in first place for Ferrari.

1928
01:53:56,750 --> 01:53:58,700
悠著點  丹  你被擋死了
Easy, Dan. You're getting boxed in.

1929
01:53:58,700 --> 01:54:01,020
他可不是傻子
He's not batting on a full wicket, that one.

1930
01:54:06,450 --> 01:54:08,320
慢慢來  丹
Easy, Dan.

1931
01:54:09,700 --> 01:54:11,020
該死
Oh, bloody hell!

1932
01:54:12,580 --> 01:54:14,620
你這個混蛋
You arsehole.

1933
01:54:31,190 --> 01:54:33,310
滾開
Oh, piss off!

1934
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:37,210
你這個混蛋
You wanker!

1935
01:54:43,980 --> 01:54:47,220
這下被撞得稀巴爛了吧
A face like a smacked arse, now, don't ya?

1936
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:03,440
保時捷58號和一輛身份不明的福特
Porsche number 58 with an unidentified Ford

1937
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:05,880
在雅致彎沖出賽道
are run off the track at Arnage.

1938
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:08,430
快點  肯  加油
Go, Ken. Come on, Ken.

1939
01:55:16,470 --> 01:55:18,340
秒表不錯
Nice stopwatch.

1940
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:20,840
你想來一個嗎  意大利貨
You want one? They're Italian.

1941
01:55:43,670 --> 01:55:45,000
駕駛福特1號的肯·邁爾斯
Ken Miles in Ford number 1

1942
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,090
和駕駛法拉利21號的班迪尼
and Bandini in Ferrari 21

1943
01:55:47,090 --> 01:55:48,770
在這樣惡劣的天氣條件下互不相讓
are locked in a battle against the elements

1944
01:55:48,770 --> 01:55:50,970
他們以極限速度
as they push their cars to the limit

1945
01:55:50,970 --> 01:55:52,590
通過白屋彎
past the White House corner.

1946
01:55:52,590 --> 01:55:53,640
現在由于下雨
And now with all that rain,

1947
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:55,230
賽道變得又濕又滑
the track conditions are wet and slippery

1948
01:55:55,230 --> 01:55:58,080
預計高速圈會受到影響
so expect these very fast laps to suffer.

1949
01:56:00,910 --> 01:56:01,910
有什么指示  先生
Yes, sir?

1950
01:56:03,150 --> 01:56:04,090
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

1951
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:05,910
明白  先生
Yes, sir.

1952
01:56:06,780 --> 01:56:08,930
是  先生  我馬上去
Okay, sir. Right away, sir.

1953
01:56:14,090 --> 01:56:15,290
{\an8}肯·邁爾斯  注意減速

1954
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:19,910
你干什么呢  把牌子給我
What the hell are you doing? Give me that.

1955
01:56:22,230 --> 01:56:23,440
白癡
Dumbass.

1956
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:24,860
謝爾比先生
Mr. Shelby...

1957
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:08,680
就是現在
Here we go.

1958
01:57:12,310 --> 01:57:13,350
快呀  寶貝
Come on, girl.

1959
01:57:13,350 --> 01:57:14,290
加把勁
Come on.

1960
01:57:20,450 --> 01:57:22,310
堅持住
Hold it together now.

1961
01:57:36,740 --> 01:57:38,030
天吶
God!

1962
01:57:40,030 --> 01:57:41,710
媽的  快呀
Bugger! Come on.

1963
01:57:41,710 --> 01:57:44,460
現在領先的是洛倫佐·班迪尼駕駛的
The leader at this moment is Ferrari number 21

1964
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:46,730
法拉利21號
being driven by Lorenzo Bandini.

1965
01:57:46,740 --> 01:57:49,530
他的剎車失靈了  準備起來
His brakes are shot. All right, here we go.

1966
01:57:49,530 --> 01:57:52,170
肯·邁爾斯非常緩慢地把福特1號
It looks like Ken Miles is bringing the number 1 Ford

1967
01:57:52,170 --> 01:57:54,570
開進了維修站  可能是出了什么...
into the pits very slowly. He could have a...

1968
01:57:54,580 --> 01:57:56,390
馬上進站  大家注意了
Coming in. Watch yourself, guys.

1969
01:57:57,540 --> 01:58:00,270
-剎車  沒反應  一點都沒有  -知道了
- Brakes. Nothing. Gone. - Yeah.

1970
01:58:00,270 --> 01:58:02,690
動作快點  快點  快點
All right. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1971
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,960
我就要超過他了  差一點就超過他了
I had him. I almost had him.

1972
01:58:08,430 --> 01:58:10,780
他現在領先我們一圈了
Well, he's putting another lap on us now.

1973
01:58:10,900 --> 01:58:13,610
好了  裝上  先裝前輪
All right. Fit it in. Do the upper arm first.

1974
01:58:13,610 --> 01:58:15,890
快點  速度快點  再快點
Come on, let's go. Come in now, now. Faster.

1975
01:58:15,890 --> 01:58:16,830
趕緊的
Let's go.

1976
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:18,330
先裝前輪
Upper arm first.

1977
01:58:18,350 --> 01:58:20,720
小心制動管路  輕點拽
Watch the brake line pulling it out.

1978
01:58:20,730 --> 01:58:22,610
他們在換剎車
They're doing it. The brakes.

1979
01:58:22,620 --> 01:58:23,650
這會花費...
Now, that's gonna take...

1980
01:58:23,650 --> 01:58:25,400
我說了  小心制動管路
I said watch the brake line.

1981
01:58:25,530 --> 01:58:27,080
快點  再快點
Faster! Faster! Faster!

1982
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:28,330
過來了  當心身后
Coming in. Watch your back!

1983
01:58:28,330 --> 01:58:30,170
杰夫  動作再快點
Jeff, you've gotta be faster!

1984
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:41,110
{\an8}法拉利車隊

1985
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:44,150
給剎車放氣  杰夫
Bleed the brakes, Jeff.

1986
01:58:44,150 --> 01:58:45,380
不行不行
No, no, no.

1987
01:58:46,250 --> 01:58:48,640
這是違規行為  你不能想怎么改就怎么改
It's against the rules. You cannot just change things.

1988
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:49,960
不不不
Oh, no, no, no.

1989
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:52,050
告訴我你的手冊上哪里寫了
You show me where it says in your book

1990
01:58:52,050 --> 01:58:54,100
我們不能更換剎車系統
that we cannot swap out the system,

1991
01:58:54,100 --> 01:58:55,110
只要你能找到  隨便你取消我們的資格
and then you can disqualify us.

1992
01:58:55,110 --> 01:58:56,760
斗牛犬  退后
Bulldog, back off.

1993
01:58:56,770 --> 01:58:58,320
冷靜點  冷靜
Calm down. Calm down.

1994
01:58:58,320 --> 01:58:59,180
這是不合法的
This is not legal.

1995
01:58:59,180 --> 01:59:01,400
你告訴我規則手冊里哪一條規定了
You show me where it says in that little rule book

1996
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:03,670
我不能換掉豎式總成
where I can't swap out my upright assembly.

1997
01:59:03,670 --> 01:59:04,800
零件就是零件
A part is a part.

1998
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:07,030
不管是剎車鉗  剎車盤還是豎式總成
Be it a brake caliper, a rotor, or an upright assembly,

1999
01:59:07,030 --> 01:59:09,500
我想換什么就換什么
and I can swap out any damn thing I want to.

2000
01:59:09,940 --> 01:59:11,740
別以為我們沒讀過規則手冊
We read your damn rule book.

2001
01:59:17,550 --> 01:59:19,770
班迪尼進站了  他進站了
Bandini's pitting. He's pitting.

2002
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:28,450
真是可惜
Oh, what a shame.

2003
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:29,920
可能是壞了一條管路
I think he blew a line.

2004
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:31,760
因為他剛剛想跟上你的速度
Well, he was trying to keep up with you.

2005
01:59:41,550 --> 01:59:43,950
雖然我不懂意大利語  但是看得出來他不高興
I don't speak Italian, but he ain't happy.

2006
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:56,970
我得趕緊出發了  老爹
Get me out of here, Pops.

2007
01:59:56,970 --> 01:59:58,120
-快點  -知道了
- Come on! - All right.

2008
01:59:58,120 --> 01:59:58,970
快點
Come on!

2009
01:59:58,970 --> 02:00:01,290
馬上就好  肯  馬上就好
Almost there, Ken. Almost there.

2010
02:00:01,890 --> 02:00:02,760
怎么樣了  兄弟
How's it looking, buddy?

2011
02:00:02,770 --> 02:00:03,980
再充點氣  就可以了
One pump, and we're good.

2012
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:05,520
可以出發了  肯
Car's yours, Ken.

2013
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:06,940
聽好了  你還有贏他的機會
All right, listen, you can still take him,

2014
02:00:06,940 --> 02:00:08,350
但是你得超過他兩次
but you gotta pass him twice.

2015
02:00:08,350 --> 02:00:10,440
知道了  超過他兩次
I get it. Pass him twice.

2016
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:19,820
肯·邁爾斯駕駛的福特1號重回賽道
Ford number 1 driven by Ken Miles is back out,

2017
02:00:19,820 --> 02:00:22,790
緊緊咬著班迪尼的法拉利21號
hot on the heels of Bandini in Ferrari 21.

2018
02:01:20,680 --> 02:01:23,970
還不夠好  邁爾斯  再加把勁
Not bloody good enough, Miles! Come on!

2019
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:25,850
他慢下來了
He's off his pace.

2020
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:29,810
他現在對車還是沒有信心
He doesn't trust the car yet.

2021
02:01:30,020 --> 02:01:32,940
加油  肯  剎車我都給你換好了
Come on, Ken. I gave you new brakes, buddy.

2022
02:01:38,860 --> 02:01:40,200
好好想想
All right.

2023
02:01:41,740 --> 02:01:43,030
你來這里是為了什么
What did you come here for?

2024
02:01:45,620 --> 02:01:46,790
放手一搏吧
Let's do it.

2025
02:02:11,140 --> 02:02:13,110
成了  加油
That's it! Come on!

2026
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:25,780
他還沒做到
He ain't done it yet.

2027
02:02:29,450 --> 02:02:31,420
他還需要再追一圈
He needs to take another lap on him.

2028
02:02:39,130 --> 02:02:41,840
{\an8}福特1號  肯·邁爾斯

2029
02:02:55,230 --> 02:02:56,940
他需要盡快進站
He needs to pit soon.

2030
02:02:56,980 --> 02:02:59,190
先追上班迪尼再說
He needs to catch Bandini first.

2031
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:11,080
來吧  你這個混蛋
All right, you bastard.

2032
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:13,750
我們再來一次
Let's do this again.

2033
02:03:43,240 --> 02:03:44,660
快呀
Come on, now.

2034
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:47,580
好樣的  好樣的
That's my girl! That's my girl!

2035
02:04:07,430 --> 02:04:10,430
我的天吶  我的天吶
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

2036
02:04:10,720 --> 02:04:11,850
媽的
Bloody hell!

2037
02:04:25,950 --> 02:04:27,990
他做到了  我們領先了
He did it. We're in the lead.

2038
02:04:28,450 --> 02:04:29,660
我們領先了嗎
Are we in the lead?

2039
02:04:30,070 --> 02:04:31,490
班迪尼呢
What about Bandini?

2040
02:04:32,450 --> 02:04:33,700
班迪尼在哪
Where's Bandini?

2041
02:04:34,330 --> 02:04:36,290
他們完了  結束了
They're done. Finished.

2042
02:04:36,790 --> 02:04:38,000
法拉利完了
Ferrari's over.

2043
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,170
邁凱輪的GT落后他四分鐘
McLaren's four minutes behind him in a GT.

2044
02:04:40,170 --> 02:04:41,750
現在肯排第一
So we're lying Ken first,

2045
02:04:41,750 --> 02:04:43,880
第二和第三  也都是福特
and two and three. All Fords.

2046
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:01,020
法拉利21號
Ferrari number 21

2047
02:05:01,190 --> 02:05:03,730
和車手班迪尼已經離開賽道
and driver Bandini have left the track.

2048
02:05:05,820 --> 02:05:07,110
大魔王來了
The Deuce is coming.

2049
02:05:16,250 --> 02:05:19,290
肯半小時后就要上了  要我叫醒他嗎
Ken's up in a half an hour. Want me to wake him?

2050
02:05:19,290 --> 02:05:20,630
不  讓他睡吧
Nah, let him sleep.

2051
02:05:22,340 --> 02:05:24,460
-非常感謝  -不可思議
- Thank you very much. - Unbelievable.

2052
02:05:24,460 --> 02:05:25,460
您好  福特先生
Hello. Mr. Ford.

2053
02:05:25,460 --> 02:05:26,630
比賽還沒有結束  不過
We're not quite there yet, but...

2054
02:05:26,670 --> 02:05:27,510
你錯過了一頓美餐
You missed a good meal.

2055
02:05:27,510 --> 02:05:29,550
他來了  他來了
There he is. There he is.

2056
02:05:31,430 --> 02:05:32,640
現在進展如何  里奧
Brief me, Leo.

2057
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:35,640
前三名都是我們的車  福特先生
We're running one, two, three, Mr. Ford.

2058
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:37,470
領頭的是誰
Who's in the lead?

2059
02:05:37,480 --> 02:05:39,100
赫爾姆和邁爾斯
Hulme, Miles.

2060
02:05:41,560 --> 02:05:43,440
我有一個想法  福特先生
You know, I was thinking, Mr. Ford...

2061
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:47,860
要是我們的三臺車可以排成一排
wouldn't it be great if all three Fords lined up

2062
02:05:47,860 --> 02:05:50,200
同時沖過終點  那該多壯觀
and crossed the finish line at the exact same time?

2063
02:05:50,700 --> 02:05:52,700
他們排成一排  一起回家
They all lined up and came home together.

2064
02:05:52,700 --> 02:05:55,330
三臺福特  并駕齊驅
Ford. Ford. Ford.

2065
02:05:55,660 --> 02:05:58,290
我覺得不太可能做到  先生
I don't think we can actually do that, sir, but...

2066
02:05:59,120 --> 02:06:00,000
為什么不能
Why not?

2067
02:06:01,080 --> 02:06:02,960
邁爾斯現在領先不止一圈  里奧
Miles is laps ahead, Leo.

2068
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:06,130
你想讓他怎么做  減速嗎
What would you have him do, slow down?

2069
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:08,670
是啊
Yeah.

2070
02:06:16,430 --> 02:06:18,520
福特先生想讓邁爾斯減減
Mr. Ford wants Miles to slow down.

2071
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:20,980
他希望三輛車可以同時沖過終點
He wants all three cars to cross at the exact same time.

2072
02:06:20,980 --> 02:06:22,770
他認為對福特來說  這將會是歷史性的一刻
He thinks it'll be a historic moment for Ford.

2073
02:06:22,770 --> 02:06:24,820
拍出來的照片一定賞心悅目
It'll make a great photograph.

2074
02:06:26,190 --> 02:06:28,690
謝爾比  邁爾斯現在要發揮團隊精神
Shelby, Miles needs to be a team player here,

2075
02:06:29,030 --> 02:06:29,950
你也一樣
and so do you.

2076
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:32,200
你來告訴他  還是我來說
You gonna tell him, or you need me to?

2077
02:06:33,660 --> 02:06:36,410
離我的車手遠一點  走開
Don't go near my driver. Go on.

2078
02:06:37,290 --> 02:06:38,660
這是福特先生的要求
This is what Mr. Ford wants.

2079
02:06:38,660 --> 02:06:39,750
給我走開
Go on now.

2080
02:06:40,290 --> 02:06:42,000
-他希望看到你們的忠誠  -走開
- He expects loyalty. - Go on.

2081
02:06:59,220 --> 02:07:01,430
行動起來  小伙子們  動作快點
Guys, let's go. Come on. All right, look lively, boys.

2082
02:07:01,430 --> 02:07:02,680
快點  弗羅斯特
Let's go. Frosty.

2083
02:07:02,690 --> 02:07:03,650
來了
Yeah, coming.

2084
02:07:05,060 --> 02:07:06,650
快點
Let's go. Come on.

2085
02:07:06,650 --> 02:07:07,820
畢比要干什么
What's Beebe want?

2086
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:15,950
看來是很過分的要求
It's off the scale, innit?

2087
02:07:21,250 --> 02:07:22,710
他們想讓你減速
They want you to slow down.

2088
02:07:27,130 --> 02:07:28,800
你再說一遍
Run that by me again.

2089
02:07:29,170 --> 02:07:30,630
他們想讓你減速
They want you to slow down.

2090
02:07:33,550 --> 02:07:35,050
肯  你讓他們的車相形見絀了
You're outshining their car, Ken.

2091
02:07:35,050 --> 02:07:37,010
你領先了邁凱倫四分鐘
You're four minutes up on McLaren.

2092
02:07:37,010 --> 02:07:38,470
大魔王希望福特的三輛車
The Deuce wants the three Fords

2093
02:07:38,470 --> 02:07:41,060
分別以第一  第二  第三名一起沖過終點線
to cross the finish line one, two, three, all together.

2094
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:48,770
他們要求你有些團隊精神
They're asking that you be a team player...

2095
02:07:50,190 --> 02:07:51,900
幫助他們拍下那樣一張照片
and make that photograph happen for 'em.

2096
02:07:51,900 --> 02:07:55,490
就為了拍張照片  他們真行啊
That photograph. That's good.

2097
02:07:55,700 --> 02:07:57,620
真會想
That is good.

2098
02:08:00,490 --> 02:08:02,450
肯  即便你和他們并列奪冠
Ken, even if you tie for first...

2099
02:08:03,290 --> 02:08:05,500
你仍然是史上第一個在同一年內奪下
you'd still be the first man ever to win...

2100
02:08:05,750 --> 02:08:08,500
賽百靈  迪通拿  和勒芒三項賽事冠軍的人
Sebring, Daytona, and Le Mans in the same year.

2101
02:08:09,130 --> 02:08:10,630
你將成為三冠王
You'd have the triple crown.

2102
02:08:17,970 --> 02:08:19,050
聽著  我沒有...
Look, I ain't get...

2103
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:22,350
我從第一天開始
I haven't been able to get you

2104
02:08:22,350 --> 02:08:23,770
就無法讓你服從命令
to follow an order since day one.

2105
02:08:24,020 --> 02:08:26,020
無論你想怎么做我都可以接受
Whatever you wanna do is fine with me.

2106
02:08:27,810 --> 02:08:28,810
我做主嗎
My choice?

2107
02:08:30,730 --> 02:08:31,730
你做主
Your choice.

2108
02:08:38,780 --> 02:08:40,160
發動機已經快到極限了
The engine's running at boiling.

2109
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:41,540
剎車也快不行了
The brakes are shot.

2110
02:08:45,250 --> 02:08:46,250
安排好了嗎
How was that?

2111
02:08:48,170 --> 02:08:49,290
都搞定了
Taken care of.

2112
02:08:49,290 --> 02:08:50,840
車準備好了  肯
The car's yours, Ken.

2113
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:52,550
肯  車為你準備好了
Ken, the car's yours.

2114
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:54,550
肯
Ken!

2115
02:08:54,550 --> 02:08:55,840
可以出發了  肯
Car's yours, Ken.

2116
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:31,250
所有車手都在追趕福特車隊
It's the Fords that are the cars to beat,

2117
02:09:31,250 --> 02:09:33,040
此刻他們的三輛車包攬了前三名
claiming the top three positions...

2118
02:09:33,040 --> 02:09:34,300
他到底在做什么
What the hell is he doing?

2119
02:09:33,290 --> 02:09:35,760
{\an8}肯·邁爾斯駕駛著福特1號位居第一
led by Ken Miles in Ford number 1...

2120
02:09:39,590 --> 02:09:40,800
不許接
Don't answer that.

2121
02:09:40,930 --> 02:09:42,100
離電話遠點
Get away from it.

2122
02:09:42,390 --> 02:09:43,680
離電話遠點
Get away from it.

2123
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:46,720
駕駛著福特1號的肯·邁爾斯
Ken Miles in Ford number 1 is demonstrating

2124
02:09:46,720 --> 02:09:49,480

with an outstanding display of skill.

2126
02:09:52,020 --> 02:09:53,890
觀眾們請瞧好福特1號
Keep an eye on Ford number 1.

2127
02:10:10,750 --> 02:10:12,370
他要破他自己的紀錄了
He's gonna break his own record.

2128
02:10:12,370 --> 02:10:13,500
別說話
Shut up.

2129
02:10:22,430 --> 02:10:23,470
等等
Wait for it.

2130
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:26,720
再等等
Wait for it.

2131
02:10:30,180 --> 02:10:30,980
就現在
Now.

2132
02:10:36,230 --> 02:10:48,870
邁爾斯  邁爾斯  邁爾斯
Miles. Miles. Miles.

2133
02:11:15,060 --> 02:11:16,020
很漂亮
Bellissimo.

2134
02:11:16,940 --> 02:11:20,190
3分30秒6  他又刷新紀錄了
3.30.6. That's another record.

2135
02:11:24,280 --> 02:11:26,110
肯·邁爾斯時再次刷新了最快圈速
Another lap record falls to Ken Miles...

2136
02:11:26,120 --> 02:11:26,990
這是完美的一圈
It's a perfect lap.

2137
02:11:26,990 --> 02:11:28,200
打破了他自己的紀錄
...breaking his own record

2138
02:11:28,200 --> 02:11:31,950
以此為謝爾比美國車隊
and virtually guaranteeing first place for Shelby American

2139
02:11:31,950 --> 02:11:33,750
以及他們出色的GT40確保了冠軍

3分30秒6

2143
02:11:41,130 --> 02:11:42,300
讓他進站
Bring him in.

2144
02:11:42,380 --> 02:11:44,220
馬上讓他進站  他已經失控了
Right now! He's outta control.

2145
02:11:44,300 --> 02:11:46,300
在他毀了那輛車  使我們無法完成比賽之前
Now, you bring him in before he wrecks that car

2146
02:11:46,300 --> 02:11:47,680
讓他進站
and we don't finish.

2147
02:11:50,060 --> 02:11:51,220
讓他進站  謝爾比
Bring him in, Shelby,

2148
02:11:51,390 --> 02:11:54,440
否則我讓SCCA和FIA把你的車隊禁了
or I will get you banned from the SCCA and the FIA.

2149
02:11:51,400 --> 02:11:54,450

Ken Miles is behind the wheel, Leo.

2151
02:11:58,270 --> 02:12:00,030

- That is quite a sight to see. - What's he doing?

2157
02:13:50,510 --> 02:13:51,880
媽媽  他為什么在減速
Mum, why is he slowing down?

2158
02:13:51,890 --> 02:13:54,810
第二名和第三名的福特賽車緊隨其后
...the second and third place Fords to close ranks.

2159
02:14:24,460 --> 02:14:27,010
三輛福特將會同時沖過終點
The three Fords are going to cross the line together.

2160
02:14:27,050 --> 02:14:29,340
肯·邁爾斯減速了  等他的隊友追上
Ken Miles slowed down. He waited for them.

2161
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:32,180
-現在三輛福特并排前行  -爸爸  不要
- Here are the Fords lined up in a row... - Dad. No.

2162
02:14:32,180 --> 02:14:33,090
-沒事的  -爸爸

02:14:33,090 --> 02:14:34,680
-沒事的  -一  二  三
- It's all right. - One, two, three.

2164
02:14:34,720 --> 02:14:35,470
他帶領著他們
Look, he's bringing them in.

2165
02:14:35,470 --> 02:14:36,900
由肯·邁爾斯引領...

2166
02:14:36,900 --> 02:14:37,930
他帶領他們一起沖過終點
He's bringing them all in together.

2167
02:14:37,930 --> 02:14:39,810
他毫無疑問是此隊的引領者...
...certainly the leader of this group

2168
02:14:39,810 --> 02:14:42,480
-他剛剛創下勒芒賽...  -干得好

2171
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:12,880
瞧瞧這場面

-干得漂亮  里奧  -你也是  唐
- Well done, Leo. - You too, Don.

2173
02:15:34,610 --> 02:15:35,780
請稍等
Please stand by.

2174
02:15:35,780 --> 02:15:37,620
最終賽果正在審核
Final results are under review.

2175
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:39,490
和我解釋一下為什么他最先沖過終點
...is explain to me how he's finished first

2176
02:15:39,490 --> 02:15:40,450
卻不是第一名
and he's not won the race?

2177
02:15:40,450 --> 02:15:42,450
因為邁凱倫的起點更靠后
Because McLaren started from further,

2178
02:15:42,450 --> 02:15:44,410
所以他更...  他贏了
so he came in... he won.

2179
02:15:44,410 --> 02:15:45,790
結果不是并列第一
Look, it's not a tie.

2180
02:15:45,790 --> 02:15:46,580
不是并列  因為邁凱倫
No, because McLaren...

2181
02:15:46,580 --> 02:15:48,210
因為邁凱倫的起點更靠后
Because McLaren started further back,

2182
02:15:48,210 --> 02:15:50,000
他說他的行駛里程更多一些
he's saying he's traveled that little bit further,

2183
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:51,460
所以他贏了  而不是肯
so he's won and not Ken.

2184
02:15:50,690 --> 02:15:52,460
{\an8}行駛里程更多  他贏了
It's a longer distance. He won.

2185
02:15:51,460 --> 02:15:53,550
這太扯了  胡扯
That is bullshit. That's bullshit.

2186
02:15:53,550 --> 02:15:55,470
謝爾  等等
Shel! Hold on!

2187
02:16:09,480 --> 02:16:10,530
并列第一呢
Where's the tie?

2188
02:16:11,110 --> 02:16:12,610
你他媽不是說并列第一嗎
Where's the goddamn tie?

2189
02:16:12,610 --> 02:16:14,900
-什么  -你這個王八蛋
- What? - You son of a bitch!

2190
02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:15,570
-謝爾比  -你早知道會這樣
- Shelby! - You knew!

2191
02:16:15,570 --> 02:16:16,530
不  我并不知道
No, I didn't know!

2192
02:16:16,530 --> 02:16:18,700
-夠了  夠了  -放開我
- That's enough! Enough! - Get off me!

2193
02:16:20,120 --> 02:16:20,700
布魯斯
Bruce.

2194
02:16:20,700 --> 02:16:22,660
賽得漂亮  兄弟  祝賀
Nice race, mate. Congrats.

2195
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:45,560
謝爾
Shel!

2196
02:16:50,110 --> 02:16:51,570
他們搶了你冠軍  肯
They robbed you, Ken.

2197
02:16:51,650 --> 02:16:53,440
以下是對賽果的澄清
Here is the clarification.

2198
02:16:53,530 --> 02:16:56,190
雖然三名車手同時沖過終點線
Though the drivers finished the race in a heat,

2199
02:16:56,190 --> 02:16:58,070
但因為邁凱倫的起點更靠后
McLaren has been ruled the winner

2200
02:16:58,070 --> 02:16:59,860
他被裁定為冠軍
as he started from farther back.

2201
02:16:59,870 --> 02:17:01,070
都是些胡扯的技術細節
Some bullshit technicality.

2202
02:17:01,070 --> 02:17:03,620
最終結果  由邁凱倫和阿蒙駕駛的
Final results. Ford number 2,

2203
02:17:03,620 --> 02:17:06,870
福特2號  贏得了比賽的冠軍
driven by McLaren and Amon, is the winner.

2204
02:17:06,870 --> 02:17:09,790
由邁爾斯和赫爾姆駕駛的福特1號
Ford number 1, driven by Miles and Hulme,

2205
02:17:09,790 --> 02:17:11,000
獲得了亞軍
second place.

2206
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,630
季軍是由巴克奴和哈切森
In third place, Bucknum and Hutcherson

2207
02:17:13,630 --> 02:17:15,340
駕駛的福特5號
in Ford number 5.

2208
02:17:15,340 --> 02:17:16,930
我根本不該和你說
I never should've asked you.

2209
02:17:22,890 --> 02:17:24,680
都是為了賣車  對吧
Selling cars, huh?

2210
02:17:27,350 --> 02:17:28,600
他們就是干這個的
That's what they do.

2211
02:17:29,810 --> 02:17:33,190
你許諾過讓我駕駛
Well, you promised me the drive.

2212
02:17:35,820 --> 02:17:36,780
沒許諾過奪冠
Not the win.

2213
02:17:38,360 --> 02:17:39,610
你開得太棒了
It was a hell of a drive.

2214
02:17:40,910 --> 02:17:42,370
是我們的車很棒
She's a hell of a machine.

2215
02:17:43,450 --> 02:17:44,450
它確實很快
She's fast.

2216
02:17:46,410 --> 02:17:47,500
還能更快
Could be faster.

2217
02:17:49,710 --> 02:17:51,460
7L發動機確實性能絕佳
The 7 liter's sweet...

2218
02:17:51,880 --> 02:17:52,880
不過
but...

2219
02:17:54,090 --> 02:17:55,880
我們仍然需要輕一些的底盤
we still need a lighter chassis.

2220
02:17:55,880 --> 02:17:59,630
我在考慮使用復合鋁材
I was thinking bonded aluminium.

2221
02:17:59,630 --> 02:18:02,930
我們要從頭開始打造  但如果能成
It's a ground-up rebuild, but if it works...

2222
02:18:03,300 --> 02:18:05,550
可以減輕幾百斤車重
we can lose a couple hundred pounds.

2223
02:18:05,560 --> 02:18:07,270
那我們還在這浪費什么時間
Well, what the hell are we doing here?

2224
02:18:08,980 --> 02:18:11,310
讓我回去洗個澡  喝杯茶
Let me take a shower, get a cup of tea...

2225
02:18:11,650 --> 02:18:13,270
再來點火腿奶酪夾面包什么的
ham and cheese cob or something.

2226
02:18:14,110 --> 02:18:16,030
我們明年再來贏這些王八蛋
We're gonna get the bastards next year.

2227
02:18:40,050 --> 02:18:42,590
油缸里還剩一點汽油
Got a bit of fuel left in the tank.

2228
02:18:43,720 --> 02:18:45,550
你覺得那些蜂窩板結構的底盤怎么樣
What do you think of those honeycomb panels?

2229
02:18:45,550 --> 02:18:47,520
是你想要的嗎
What you were looking for?

2230
02:18:47,640 --> 02:18:48,680
還不知道
Don't know yet.

2231
02:19:14,540 --> 02:19:16,040
這車看起來相當棒
She looks pretty good.

2232
02:19:26,600 --> 02:19:29,970
在七千轉時  有一個臨界點
There's a point, at 7,000 RPM...

2233
02:19:31,310 --> 02:19:33,480
一切都變得虛無
where everything fades.

2234
02:19:36,060 --> 02:19:38,530
車失去了重量
The machine becomes weightless.

2235
02:19:39,440 --> 02:19:40,740
直接消失了
Just disappears.

2236
02:19:41,860 --> 02:19:42,530
爽
Yeah!

2237
02:19:42,530 --> 02:19:44,860
只留下一具軀殼
And all that's left is a body...

2238
02:19:44,950 --> 02:19:46,990
在時空中穿梭
moving through space and time.

2239
02:19:50,370 --> 02:19:52,080
七千轉
7,000 RPM.

2240
02:19:53,410 --> 02:19:54,830
就是那個臨界點
That's where you meet it.

2241
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:58,420
你能感覺到它的來臨
You feel it coming.

2242
02:19:58,630 --> 02:20:01,050
它悄悄地逼近你  來到你的耳邊
It creeps up on you, close in your ear.

2243
02:20:09,260 --> 02:20:10,770
向你提出一個問題
Asks you a question.

2244
02:20:12,060 --> 02:20:13,850
一個終極的問題
The only question that matters.

2245
02:20:19,610 --> 02:20:20,610
把貨車開過來
Get the van!

2246
02:20:22,360 --> 02:20:23,280
"你究竟是誰"
"Who are you?"

2247
02:20:57,690 --> 02:20:58,520
感覺如何
What do you think?

2248
02:20:58,520 --> 02:21:01,320
太棒了  感覺好極了
It's fantastic. Feels really good.

2249
02:21:01,860 --> 02:21:03,030
駕駛感流暢
Nice and smooth.

2250
02:21:03,980 --> 02:21:06,360
變速箱沒有振動  感覺馬力強勁
No vibration in the box. Feels really strong.

2251
02:21:06,360 --> 02:21:08,320
你才開了不到一小時
You drove it for less than an hour.

2252
02:21:08,860 --> 02:21:10,910
你能感覺出來個屁
You can't tell shit after an hour.

2253
02:21:10,910 --> 02:21:14,500
每輛車七千塊整  總共就是一萬四
Go for seven even, that'd be 14 all in.

2254
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:15,250
謝爾
Shel.

2255
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:20,020
{\an8}賽道之星

2256
02:21:25,800 --> 02:21:28,800
謝爾  那個家伙  就是那個戴帽子的
Shel, that guy, you know the one in the hat,

2257
02:21:28,800 --> 02:21:31,260
他已經決定下單兩輛眼鏡蛇427
he's ready to close on those two 427s.

2258
02:21:31,260 --> 02:21:34,020
他和他太太一人一輛  全額運費
His and hers. Full freight.

2259
02:21:34,680 --> 02:21:37,310
他們是從加爾溫斯頓飛過來的
They, flew in from Galveston.

2260
02:21:41,020 --> 02:21:43,940
我需要你出來個一兩分鐘
I need you to come outside for maybe a minute.

2261
02:21:44,610 --> 02:21:45,650
做什么
And do what?

2262
02:21:47,610 --> 02:21:49,070
做卡羅爾·謝爾比
Be Carroll Shelby.

2263
02:21:50,070 --> 02:21:52,950
給他們講個故事  說點吉祥話
Tell them a story, spin a few magic words.

2264
02:21:53,530 --> 02:21:56,370
"吉祥話"是什么意思
What does that mean? "Magic words"?

2265
02:21:57,500 --> 02:21:58,620
我的意思是
It means...

2266
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:01,120
出來跟他們打個招呼
come outside and say hello

2267
02:22:01,120 --> 02:22:03,250
讓他們這個錢花得心里舒服
and make them feel good about their purchase.

2268
02:22:03,250 --> 02:22:04,540
他們買的是車
They're getting the damn cars.

2269
02:22:04,540 --> 02:22:06,460
他們花了錢  車就歸他們了  菲爾
That's what they get for their money, Phil.

2270
02:22:06,760 --> 02:22:08,210
要買就買  不買拉倒
Now, either they want 'em or they don't.

2271
02:22:08,220 --> 02:22:09,920
-我難道是個戲子嗎  -不是
- Am I some kind of a lounge act? - No.

2272
02:22:09,930 --> 02:22:11,840
我難道是個搞推銷的嗎
Am I here to talk people into things?

2273
02:22:23,270 --> 02:22:25,110
已經過去六個月了  謝爾
It's been six months, Shel.

2274
02:22:26,650 --> 02:22:27,940
六個月了
Six months.

2275
02:22:32,780 --> 02:22:34,830
有時候他們不會活著下車
Sometimes they don't get out of the car.

2276
02:23:10,320 --> 02:23:11,570
彼得
Peter!

2277
02:23:12,530 --> 02:23:15,160
彼得  來把垃圾搬出去
Peter, come and take the garbage out.

2278
02:23:15,280 --> 02:23:16,660
謝爾比先生
Mr. Shelby.

2279
02:23:18,540 --> 02:23:19,410
你好  彼得
Hello, Pete.

2280
02:23:21,710 --> 02:23:23,290
我記得那把扳手
I remember that wrench.

2281
02:23:24,370 --> 02:23:25,960
我爸爸拿它扔了你
My dad threw it at you.

2282
02:23:27,590 --> 02:23:28,760
是的
I believe he did.

2283
02:23:29,710 --> 02:23:30,550
為什么
Why?

2284
02:23:35,890 --> 02:23:37,810
好像因為我對他說了些什么
I think I probably said something to him.

2285
02:23:38,930 --> 02:23:40,390
罵了他幾句
Called him a few names.

2286
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:43,640
沒錯
That's right.

2287
02:23:52,780 --> 02:23:54,410
你要找我媽媽嗎
Do you wanna speak to my mum?

2288
02:23:55,110 --> 02:23:56,200
我是想找她
Well, I did.

2289
02:23:56,740 --> 02:24:00,200
我想來打個招呼  看她過得好不好  還有...
I came to say hello, check in on her and...

2290
02:24:04,870 --> 02:24:06,830
然后我想到  有時候
Then I started thinking that sometimes...

2291
02:24:10,670 --> 02:24:11,630
言語...
words...

2292
02:24:12,260 --> 02:24:16,300
根本沒有任何用處
just... ar-are not useful.

2293
02:24:22,140 --> 02:24:24,480
工具是有用的  因為你能用它們造東西
Tools are useful 'cause you can make stuff with 'em

2294
02:24:24,480 --> 02:24:26,480
也能用它們修東西
and you can fix stuff with 'em.

2295
02:24:27,730 --> 02:24:28,610
給你
Here.

2296
02:24:30,190 --> 02:24:31,230
謝謝
Thanks.

2297
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:41,670
你爸爸是...
Your daddy was...

2298
02:24:45,160 --> 02:24:46,580
他是你的朋友
He was your friend.

2299
02:24:52,960 --> 02:24:54,130
是的  他是我的朋友
Yes, he was.

2300
02:24:55,670 --> 02:24:57,020
沒錯  小伙子
Yes, sir.

2301
02:25:02,180 --> 02:25:05,230
他覺得你是個特別棒的孩子
And he thought you was just finer than frog fur.

2302
02:25:09,730 --> 02:25:11,020
彼得
Peter!

2303
02:25:16,240 --> 02:25:18,240
我得去幫媽媽干活了
I think I've gotta go help my mum.

2304
02:25:20,530 --> 02:25:22,910
那你還磨蹭什么呢  快去吧
What are you doing here then? Go on.

2305
02:25:23,830 --> 02:25:24,790
再見
Bye.
