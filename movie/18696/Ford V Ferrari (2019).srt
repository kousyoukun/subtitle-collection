<i>This is live coverage</i>

3
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,816
<i>of the 1959
24 Hours of Le Mans.</i>

4
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:58,416
<i>We've reached
the halfway point</i>

5
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:01,020
<i>and so far witnessed
Aston Martin number 5,</i>

<i>driven by Carroll Shelby,</i>

7
00:01:02,654 --> 00:01:05,091
<i>making great gains
in the last hour.</i>

8
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:06,491
<i>If he keeps this pace up,</i>

9
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:08,027
<i>he could have
a chance at the...</i>

10
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,779
He's coming in.

11
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:28,915
He's coming in.
Let's go, let's go.

12
00:01:29,015 --> 00:01:31,017
- Tires!
- Let's go, let's go.

13
00:01:31,117 --> 00:01:32,285
I know you're tired,
but come on,

14
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,286
let's make this fast.

15
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,821
Move, move, move!

16
00:01:36,856 --> 00:01:38,291
She's running a little hot,
but we're good.

17
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,792
Tires are still gripping.

18
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,326
Fire! The fuel! Fire!

19
00:01:41,426 --> 00:01:42,995
- Shelby, it's you!
- Grab that blanket!

20
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:46,631
Get off me! Off!

21
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:50,335
You okay?

22
00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:54,006
Fill the tank!

23
00:01:55,607 --> 00:01:57,810
- Shelby, you just...
- Am I on fire?

24
00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:00,947
Am I on goddamn fire?

25
00:02:01,047 --> 00:02:02,614
- No, you're not on fire.
- Fill the damn tank!

26
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:04,016
- Fill the tank.
- Fill the tank.

27
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:05,184
Get it ready!

28
00:02:05,985 --> 00:02:08,420
- Where am I, Eddie?
- Two laps up, my friend.

29
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,487
Car's yours.

30
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,123
Go get 'em.

31
00:02:32,912 --> 00:02:34,512
<i>Aston Martin number 5,</i>

32
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,916
<i>driven by Carroll Shelby,
has maintained his lead</i>

33
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:39,417
<i>as we're nearing
the final minutes of the race.</i>

34
00:02:39,517 --> 00:02:40,585
<i>Shelby.</i>

35
00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:41,988
<i>The checkered flag is out.</i>

36
00:02:43,356 --> 00:02:45,024
<i>The crowd are on their feet.</i>

37
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:45,892
<i>Shelby.</i>

38
00:02:45,992 --> 00:02:47,159
<i>...takes the title!</i>

39
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,327
<i>An American wins Le Mans.</i>

40
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:49,628
<i>Shelby.</i>

41
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,265
Carroll Shelby.

42
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:53,598
What?

43
00:02:53,698 --> 00:02:55,768
This is something
you can't ignore anymore.

44
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:57,970
Oh, I take the pills.
The pills work.

45
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,908
An elevated
heart rate, say 130 BPM,

46
00:03:02,008 --> 00:03:04,310
sustained even
for a short period,

47
00:03:04,442 --> 00:03:06,112
you run a critical risk
of cardiac arrest.

48
00:03:06,212 --> 00:03:08,580
- I'll race shorter format then.
- That's not gonna work.

49
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,384
Well, I could race NASCAR.
Formula One.

50
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,418
The valve is shot, Shelby.

51
00:03:13,886 --> 00:03:15,520
This is as serious as it gets.

52
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,790
In my opinion, you're lucky
to be sitting here today.

53
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,093
Well, I feel real lucky.

54
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,163
Luckiest guy on earth.

55
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:46,285
<i>There's a point
at 7,000 RPM</i>

56
00:03:46,385 --> 00:03:48,254
<i>where everything fades.</i>

57
00:03:56,963 --> 00:04:00,032
<i>The machine
becomes weightless.</i>

58
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:01,233
<i>Just disappears.</i>

59
00:04:02,935 --> 00:04:03,970
Hey!

60
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:05,938
Watch it, buddy!

61
00:04:10,076 --> 00:04:13,145
<i>And all that's left
is a body</i>

62
00:04:13,245 --> 00:04:15,047
<i>moving through space and time.</i>

63
00:04:21,287 --> 00:04:22,955
<i>7,000 RPM.</i>

64
00:04:24,656 --> 00:04:26,025
<i>That's where you meet it.</i>

65
00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:31,629
<i>It asks you a question.</i>

66
00:04:32,597 --> 00:04:34,000
<i>The only question
that matters.</i>

67
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:38,971
<i>"Who are you?"</i>

68
00:04:45,845 --> 00:04:47,880
Now, it's von Trips
in the Ferrari,

69
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,714
coming into the corkscrew.
He's braking late.

70
00:04:49,815 --> 00:04:50,916
Hey, I called you
three times,

71
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:52,318
and you never answer
the phone.

72
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:53,585
Oh! He sets a new lap record!

73
00:04:53,685 --> 00:04:54,920
I answer the phone
every time it rings.

74
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:56,422
- No, sir, you do not.
- Yes, I do.

75
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:57,490
No, you don't.

76
00:04:57,823 --> 00:04:59,759
A month ago, this car was fun.

77
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:03,729
Now, it won't even start.
And when it does,

78
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:05,264
it's, "Boom, boom, boom!"

79
00:05:05,865 --> 00:05:07,632
When I pull out
of the driveway,

80
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:10,069
the dog has a heart attack.

81
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:12,304
All I'm asking is for
you to make it like it was.

82
00:05:12,405 --> 00:05:14,340
Yeah, you've coked up

83
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,875
the inlet valves
and the plugs.

84
00:05:15,975 --> 00:05:17,309
Nothing wrong with the car,

85
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,444
just the way
it's being driven.

86
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:19,677
The way
it's being driven?

87
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:20,846
Too much fuel,
not enough spark.

88
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,048
That's what's
making her misfire.

89
00:05:22,148 --> 00:05:23,681
You wanna run that
by me in English?

90
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:27,086
All right, sir.

91
00:05:28,354 --> 00:05:30,322
So...

92
00:05:30,423 --> 00:05:33,558
that there,
that is a sport car.

93
00:05:33,658 --> 00:05:35,693
You have to drive her
like a sport car.

94
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:37,595
If you drive her
like a school teacher,

95
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:38,964
she'll clog up. All right?

96
00:05:39,065 --> 00:05:42,535
Try changing up
at 5,000 RPM, not two.

97
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:46,872
Drive like you mean it.
Hard and tight.

98
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:48,207
She'll run clean.

99
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:50,076
Are you telling me
I don't know

100
00:05:50,176 --> 00:05:52,044
how to drive my own car?

101
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:54,313
No.

102
00:05:54,712 --> 00:05:56,048
But if you ask me,
this isn't your car.

103
00:05:56,148 --> 00:06:00,152
Your car's more a Plymouth
or a Studebaker.

104
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:03,355
You and me have
a problem, buddy?

105
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:06,225
I don't have a problem.
I had an MG.

106
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,592
Mine ran just fine.

107
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:09,361
Screw you, you limey prick.

108
00:06:09,627 --> 00:06:10,563
I want my money back.

109
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,932
Oh, behave. I'd give it to ya.

110
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:15,201
But you haven't paid
for last month's service yet.

111
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:17,570
This country,
the customer's always right.

112
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:18,804
You ever hear that?

113
00:06:18,904 --> 00:06:21,207
Yeah. Yeah.

114
00:06:21,307 --> 00:06:22,707
Utter nonsense.

115
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:25,311
Now remember,
I advanced the timing,

116
00:06:25,411 --> 00:06:28,547
so a smidge twitchy in first.

117
00:06:28,646 --> 00:06:31,517
Get the revs up.
Good lad. Revs up.

118
00:06:33,452 --> 00:06:34,787
Ta-ra.

119
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,091
Another satisfied customer?

120
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:43,729
Can I help you, miss?

121
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,665
Wasn't that an MGA 1500?

122
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,669
Ah, you know your cars.

123
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,305
Well, I like them.

124
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:55,407
I love the sound they make.

125
00:06:55,508 --> 00:06:57,209
The way it goes
right through you.

126
00:06:57,476 --> 00:06:58,611
Right.

127
00:06:59,677 --> 00:07:01,113
That vibration.

128
00:07:03,282 --> 00:07:06,819
Mine's the wood-paneled

129
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:09,054
Country Squire...

130
00:07:09,155 --> 00:07:10,789
across the street.

131
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,160
A real hot rod.

132
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,394
Oh, yeah?

133
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,263
- Is it fast?
- Very.

134
00:07:17,796 --> 00:07:19,999
Wait a second.
What type of girl are ya?

135
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:22,835
Type of girl who likes
the smell of wet gasoline.

136
00:07:22,935 --> 00:07:24,236
- Oh.
- Burnt rubber.

137
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:26,639
Oh, what, are you some kind
of a deviant,

138
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:27,973
are ya?

139
00:07:28,374 --> 00:07:30,075
Well, only since
I married you.

140
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,385
Hey, Gar,
what's going on?

141
00:07:39,485 --> 00:07:40,718
Something's up.

142
00:07:42,221 --> 00:07:43,222
Hi, Lee.

143
00:07:43,322 --> 00:07:44,456
Listen,
he isn't as sure as you are

144
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:45,791
about the banks.

145
00:07:47,326 --> 00:07:49,061
I'm not as sure
about this...

146
00:07:49,895 --> 00:07:51,830
How's this going out?

147
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:57,336
- Don, what's going on?
- I don't know.

148
00:07:58,737 --> 00:07:59,872
Mr. Ford,
welcome to the room.

149
00:07:59,972 --> 00:08:00,973
Good afternoon,
Mr. Ford.

150
00:08:01,073 --> 00:08:02,408
Nice to see you, sir.

151
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,148
Shut it down, Mr. Beebe.

152
00:08:16,088 --> 00:08:17,122
John!

153
00:08:19,992 --> 00:08:23,262
All stop.

154
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,774
Hear that?

155
00:08:38,244 --> 00:08:42,448
That's the sound
of the Ford Motor Company...

156
00:08:43,182 --> 00:08:45,117
out of business.

157
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:55,928
In 1899, my grandfather,
Henry, by God, Ford...

158
00:08:56,228 --> 00:08:59,565
was walking home
from Edison Illumination

159
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,800
after working a double shift.

160
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,469
He was ruminating.

161
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:06,872
That morning,
he had himself an idea

162
00:09:06,972 --> 00:09:09,108
that changed the world.

163
00:09:09,608 --> 00:09:11,243
Sixty-five years

164
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:14,780
and 47 million
automobiles later,

165
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,982
what shall be his legacy?

166
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:22,521
Getting it in the tail pipe
from a Chevy Impala.

167
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:29,161
Here's what I want you to do.

168
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,896
Walk home.

169
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:38,170
While you're walking,
I want you to ruminate.

170
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:41,775
Man comes to my office
with an idea,

171
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:44,476
that man keeps his job.

172
00:09:45,244 --> 00:09:48,213
Rest of you
second-best losers...

173
00:09:48,947 --> 00:09:50,349
stay home.

174
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:52,351
You don't belong at Ford.

175
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:05,497
Shelby!

176
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,468
I see you.
Up and at 'em, buddy.

177
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:13,639
- Hey!
- Go away.

178
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,607
Come on. You can do it.

179
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:18,477
Come on, baby.

180
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,846
8:30 a.m., time to roll.

181
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:22,181
Let's go.

182
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:24,717
- Let's go. Let's go, go, go.
- Go away.

183
00:10:24,818 --> 00:10:27,252
It's 8:30 a.m., baby.
Time to roll.

184
00:10:28,554 --> 00:10:29,955
Come on.

185
00:10:30,723 --> 00:10:31,758
Hey, Phil.

186
00:10:31,857 --> 00:10:33,092
Hey, Bob.

187
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:34,093
Is Shelby here?

188
00:10:34,193 --> 00:10:36,261
Uh, it's touch and go.

189
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,203
Shelby, you're up
bright and early.

190
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:47,606
Well, early bird gets
the worm, Pops.

191
00:10:52,044 --> 00:10:53,212
All right,
who you worried about?

192
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:56,415
Well, you got Red Faris
and Bill Rushton.

193
00:10:56,515 --> 00:10:57,883
They're all in 327s.

194
00:10:57,983 --> 00:10:59,451
Corvettes.
What about Bondurant?

195
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:01,220
Bondurant? Well,
he's still driving...

196
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,622
- Mr. Shelby, can I get an autograph?
- ...for Washburn.

197
00:11:04,356 --> 00:11:05,825
Number 614.

198
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,260
- Thank you so much.
- All right, just relax. All right.

199
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,462
We're gonna eat those Vettes
for breakfast.

200
00:11:10,562 --> 00:11:11,897
We're lighter, we're faster,

201
00:11:11,997 --> 00:11:13,465
and that don't work,
we're nastier.

202
00:11:13,565 --> 00:11:16,135
<i>Hey, Dad,
before the race starts,</i>

203
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:18,070
<i>take your son over
to the Willow Springs...</i>

204
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:21,373
Hey, Phil. Hey,
take it easy on us today, bud.

205
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:26,612
You all right?

206
00:11:26,712 --> 00:11:27,847
Paragraph 15.4,

207
00:11:27,946 --> 00:11:29,681
section 2b
of the SCCA standard

208
00:11:29,783 --> 00:11:32,050
dictates all AF class cars
must have

209
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:34,754
minimum trunk space
of 20 inches by 12 inches

210
00:11:34,854 --> 00:11:36,188
by six inches.

211
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:37,923
Your trunk doesn't close.

212
00:11:38,023 --> 00:11:40,192
- Ergo car fails standard.
- Wait, wait, wait. What?

213
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:42,796
Ergo car is disqualified
from said Class A competition.

214
00:11:42,896 --> 00:11:44,096
No, no, no. Look, look, look.

215
00:11:44,196 --> 00:11:45,397
Can I ask you a question,
all right?

216
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:48,233
When you were a little boy,
did you think,

217
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,302
"When I grow up, I want to go

218
00:11:50,402 --> 00:11:52,538
"to the fabled
Willow Springs Raceway,

219
00:11:52,638 --> 00:11:55,407
"and I want to enforce
paragraph 15.4, section 2b

220
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:58,143
"of the SCCA regulations
on luggage capacity"?

221
00:11:58,243 --> 00:11:59,711
- All right, that's it.
- Did you?

222
00:11:59,813 --> 00:12:03,315
I'm ruling you and your team
disqualified from this race.

223
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:06,585
Ah, well,
if it isn't Lance Reventlow.

224
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,755
- Ah, Shelby.
- How you doing, Lance?

225
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:09,923
- Pops.
- Hey, Lance.

226
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,356
Allow me to introduce
Dieter Voss.

227
00:12:11,457 --> 00:12:12,792
Runs Brumos Porsche
out of Jacksonville.

228
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:14,426
Oh, I know all about Mr. Voss.

229
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,962
You're having a hell of a
season with that Abarth, sir.

230
00:12:17,062 --> 00:12:18,865
Seeing results
for your Cobra, too.

231
00:12:18,964 --> 00:12:20,900
- Thank you.
- Your guy Miles is impressive.

232
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:22,501
- Oh, you following Miles?
- Oh, yes.

233
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:25,404
Well, he was a USAC
road racing champ in '61.

234
00:12:25,504 --> 00:12:27,005
He won
the Pikes Peak Hill Climb.

235
00:12:27,105 --> 00:12:29,809
He was SCCA C-class champion
three years in a row

236
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:32,010
in this piece-of-shit MG
he built himself.

237
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,880
We heard he's, uh, difficult.

238
00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:35,748
What, Ken? No, no.
Ken's a puppy dog.

239
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:38,083
Hey, Lance, tell the man.
You've raced against Ken.

240
00:12:38,183 --> 00:12:40,787
Oh, I've driven more
behind him than against him.

241
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:43,756
Well, Brumos is looking
for a driver

242
00:12:43,857 --> 00:12:45,591
for our number two car
at Sebring.

243
00:12:45,691 --> 00:12:47,359
- Is that right?
- How is that even possible?

244
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,161
Think your guy Miles
can make the grade?

245
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:51,129
- Oh, well, Ken...
- Is he, mate? Hey!

246
00:12:51,363 --> 00:12:54,066
Jim! Is he putting
his bloody carryall

247
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,300
- in your trunk?
- What?

248
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,668
Discretionary infraction.

249
00:12:56,769 --> 00:12:58,337
Gentlemen, excuse me a moment.

250
00:12:59,004 --> 00:13:01,707
To be honest,
Ken was born for Sebring.

251
00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:05,210
Nothing in there
about my trunk

252
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,613
and your lovely
little portmanteau.

253
00:13:07,713 --> 00:13:11,283
You're holding
the '62 edition of the SCCA.

254
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:15,621
And you can stick
this bloody sticker

255
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:17,055
where the sun don't shine.

256
00:13:17,155 --> 00:13:18,958
Hey. Hey, Bill. What seems
to be the problem, Bill?

257
00:13:19,057 --> 00:13:21,527
The problem is that
Bill here is an arsehole.

258
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:24,062
- No, he doesn't mean that.
- Oh, yes, he does. Yes, he does.

259
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:27,533
No, he really does think
that Bill is an arsehole.

260
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:29,501
- I'm just doing my job here.
- Hang on. Bill, Bill, Bill.

261
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,670
In my experience, there is...
Listen to me.

262
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:33,505
Something like this, there's
always a middle ground.

263
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:34,841
All right?
Now, Ken's outta line.

264
00:13:34,941 --> 00:13:35,909
And I'm just doing my job.

265
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:37,075
I understand you are.

266
00:13:37,175 --> 00:13:38,043
You know how he gets
on a race day.

267
00:13:38,143 --> 00:13:39,344
You know that. All right?

268
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,914
But you're not gonna DQ us
over a trunk.

269
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:49,989
- What?
- You see that guy?

270
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:51,390
Got his tail up.

271
00:13:58,664 --> 00:13:59,698
Happy, Bill?

272
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:03,736
Bill, I'll handle it.
I'll talk to him.

273
00:14:03,836 --> 00:14:06,371
I'll talk to him. You just go
and have a great day.

274
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,473
<i>Hey, folks, feeling hungry?</i>

275
00:14:08,574 --> 00:14:10,509
<i>Head on over
to the snack bar...</i>

276
00:14:10,777 --> 00:14:11,778
Shit.

277
00:14:12,277 --> 00:14:13,679
- Bulldog.
- Huh?

278
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,816
You know who that was
I was just talking to?

279
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:17,917
Bill.

280
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:19,251
- Before that.
- No.

281
00:14:19,351 --> 00:14:21,186
It was Dieter Voss.

282
00:14:21,286 --> 00:14:22,588
Who's that?

283
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,324
He runs Porsche, Ken.

284
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:27,526
It's a little German car company.
Maybe you heard of it.

285
00:14:27,626 --> 00:14:28,493
All right.

286
00:14:28,594 --> 00:14:30,095
He wanted you to drive
at Sebring.

287
00:14:30,195 --> 00:14:32,097
But he'd heard
you were difficult.

288
00:14:37,235 --> 00:14:42,474
I thought we felt the same way
about, uh, Germans.

289
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:48,513
Do you like losing, Ken?

290
00:14:50,482 --> 00:14:51,516
Excuse me?

291
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:52,819
Oh, you heard me.

292
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,954
I don't lose.

293
00:14:55,755 --> 00:14:59,291
Without sponsors,
you get no car, Ken.

294
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:01,094
And last I checked,
the professionals

295
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:02,895
- all have a car.
- Shel!

296
00:15:02,996 --> 00:15:05,130
You cannot win the SCCA
without one.

297
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,132
If you're not winning,
you are losing.

298
00:15:07,232 --> 00:15:09,334
Don't make me lamp this
at your head.

299
00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:10,837
Did you bring your son
all the way out here

300
00:15:10,937 --> 00:15:12,038
to watch you
get disqualified

301
00:15:12,137 --> 00:15:13,672
or just act like a jackass?

302
00:15:18,011 --> 00:15:19,244
Damn!

303
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,883
Well, that answers that.

304
00:15:41,868 --> 00:15:44,202
Peter...

305
00:15:53,012 --> 00:15:54,646
May I help you,
gentlemen?

306
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:56,581
Uh, yes,
is Ken Miles here?

307
00:15:57,182 --> 00:15:58,117
No.

308
00:15:58,216 --> 00:15:59,217
We need to speak to Mr. Miles.

309
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:00,485
I'm his wife.

310
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,320
<i>Welcome to the 1963</i>

311
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:04,389
<i>Willow Springs 100.</i>

312
00:16:04,489 --> 00:16:07,693
<i>Twelve cars will be competing
in this 40-lap race.</i>

313
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,930
Hey, Ken,
what happened to your shield?

314
00:16:12,364 --> 00:16:14,666
New design.

315
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:16,769
<i>Well, it looks
like we're about to begin.</i>

316
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:19,005
<i>The cars have completed
their warm-up lap.</i>

317
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:20,706
<i>The green flag is out...</i>

318
00:16:21,808 --> 00:16:24,342
<i>and they're approaching
the starting line.</i>

319
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:25,978
Here we go.

320
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:30,215
Oh, bloody hell.

321
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:35,154
<i>Ken Miles has fallen behind.</i>

322
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:37,589
Learn to drive, you pillock!

323
00:16:43,395 --> 00:16:44,931
So, Shelby, do you miss it?

324
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:48,835
Hey, Sam.

325
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:53,072
Guy wins the 24-hour Le Mans,
suddenly retires,

326
00:16:53,538 --> 00:16:55,240
starts selling cars.

327
00:16:56,274 --> 00:16:57,442
It just don't make sense.

328
00:16:57,542 --> 00:16:59,812
Well, unless the rumors
are true, of course.

329
00:17:00,378 --> 00:17:02,414
Oh, what rumors
would those be, Sam?

330
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:04,851
That Carroll Shelby
quit driving

331
00:17:04,951 --> 00:17:05,885
'cause he lost his nerve.

332
00:17:11,623 --> 00:17:14,761
I'm gonna out-brake you
on the next turn, Bob.

333
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:28,473
Ha-ha! Nice try, Bob.

334
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,459
<i>Nice move from Ken Miles.</i>

335
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:48,761
<i>Twenty-two laps remaining,</i>

336
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:50,763
<i>with Phil Hill
and Dan Gurney in the lead.</i>

337
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,221
<i>It's been an incredible day</i>

338
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,488
<i>here at Willow Springs,</i>

339
00:18:16,588 --> 00:18:18,758
<i>and we've seen
some exciting driving.</i>

340
00:18:18,858 --> 00:18:22,195
<i>With just one lap remaining
in this 40-lap race,</i>

341
00:18:22,295 --> 00:18:23,896
<i>we're coming
to the final stretch.</i>

342
00:18:23,996 --> 00:18:26,866
<i>Dan Gurney has been leading
the pack for most of the...</i>

343
00:18:26,966 --> 00:18:28,301
<i>Whoa!</i>

344
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:30,837
<i>Number 18, Red Faris,</i>

345
00:18:30,937 --> 00:18:31,938
<i>is off the track.</i>

346
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:33,806
<i>That leaves Dan Gurney
for the lead</i>

347
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:36,408
<i>followed by journeyman
Ken Miles.</i>

348
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,345
Now for you, Dan.

349
00:18:45,151 --> 00:18:47,286
<i>And they're
coming around the last turn.</i>

350
00:18:47,385 --> 00:18:48,754
<i>Gurney is still in the lead</i>

351
00:18:48,855 --> 00:18:50,522
<i>with Ken Miles
hot on his heels.</i>

352
00:18:58,264 --> 00:18:59,832
<i>Miles is looking
for an opening.</i>

353
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:00,900
Not yet.

354
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,736
Come on.

355
00:19:03,836 --> 00:19:05,872
<i>Can Gurney hold
him off in the final straight?</i>

356
00:19:05,972 --> 00:19:06,973
Not yet.

357
00:19:09,574 --> 00:19:11,210
<i>Gurney is blocking him out.</i>

358
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,510
Now.

359
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:17,850
<i>Miles goes for the shoulder.</i>

360
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:18,985
Nice move, Ken.

361
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:24,723
<i>They're wheel to wheel.</i>

362
00:19:24,824 --> 00:19:25,925
Come on.

363
00:19:26,025 --> 00:19:27,860
<i>It's Corvette versus Cobra</i>

364
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,461
<i>for the finish.</i>

365
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:33,900
Yeah! Ha-ha!

366
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,667
Yeah!

367
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:38,503
<i>An incredible
finish for Ken Miles.</i>

368
00:19:38,603 --> 00:19:41,874
<i>Didn't see that one coming.</i>

369
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,409
He's difficult but good.

370
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:45,677
<i>Let's give
everyone a hand</i>

371
00:19:45,778 --> 00:19:47,013
<i>for one heck of a race.</i>

372
00:19:47,113 --> 00:19:49,782
That calls
for a nice cup of tea.

373
00:19:49,882 --> 00:19:51,683
I'll put the kettle on.

374
00:19:51,784 --> 00:19:52,752
Hop in.

375
00:19:57,323 --> 00:19:59,025
<i>I'm</i>

376
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,027
<i>H-A-P-P-Y</i>

377
00:20:01,127 --> 00:20:02,962
<i>I'm H-A-P-P-Y</i>

378
00:20:03,062 --> 00:20:07,166
<i>I know I am, I'm sure I am
I'm H-A-P-P-Y</i>

379
00:20:09,335 --> 00:20:11,003
Pops, frame this.

380
00:20:23,282 --> 00:20:24,516
Hey.

381
00:20:25,985 --> 00:20:27,452
We did it.

382
00:20:29,587 --> 00:20:31,023
What's wrong?

383
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:34,260
The IRS came.

384
00:20:34,927 --> 00:20:36,729
They've padlocked the garage.

385
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:43,702
All right, Petey.

386
00:20:56,481 --> 00:20:57,984
A couple of years ago...

387
00:20:59,118 --> 00:21:00,786
you said we'd a nest egg.

388
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,554
Correct.

389
00:21:03,823 --> 00:21:05,257
A couple of years ago.

390
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:06,726
Correct.

391
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,966
So just to be clear,
we are buggered.

392
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,035
Absolutely.

393
00:21:22,475 --> 00:21:24,043
As in totally?

394
00:21:24,642 --> 00:21:29,714
As in, not a bean,
or a pot in which to piss.

395
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:32,684
Spares, stock, all gone.

396
00:21:32,785 --> 00:21:35,221
Tools. My tools
are locked up in there.

397
00:21:36,721 --> 00:21:38,656
I'll figure something out.

398
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:41,659
In 1945...

399
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:43,896
our soldiers came home.

400
00:21:44,696 --> 00:21:46,531
What was the first thing
that they did?

401
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,668
They had sex.

402
00:21:51,437 --> 00:21:52,872
Seventeen years later,

403
00:21:53,205 --> 00:21:54,774
those babies, they've grown.

404
00:21:54,874 --> 00:21:56,308
And they've got jobs.

405
00:21:56,742 --> 00:21:57,843
They've got licenses.

406
00:21:58,377 --> 00:22:02,248
But they do not wanna drive
the same dull 50s cars

407
00:22:02,348 --> 00:22:03,849
that their parents drove.

408
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,086
You see, kids today,
they want glamour.

409
00:22:07,186 --> 00:22:09,355
They want sex appeal.

410
00:22:09,455 --> 00:22:10,655
They want to go fast.

411
00:22:11,357 --> 00:22:12,391
Gentlemen...

412
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,261
it's time for
the Ford Motor Company

413
00:22:15,361 --> 00:22:16,594
to go racing.

414
00:22:17,997 --> 00:22:20,565
We're already
in racing, Iacocca.

415
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,234
NASCAR?

416
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:24,437
It's... it's regional, sir.

417
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,973
If you go to the movies,
you open up a magazine,

418
00:22:28,074 --> 00:22:30,509
you don't see good ol' boys
from Winston-Salem.

419
00:22:30,608 --> 00:22:32,178
You see, uh...

420
00:22:33,045 --> 00:22:34,413
Sophia Loren...

421
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,049
Monica Vitti.

422
00:22:39,852 --> 00:22:43,189
James Bond does not drive
a Ford, sir.

423
00:22:43,556 --> 00:22:45,723
That's because
he's a degenerate.

424
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:50,429
See?

425
00:22:50,896 --> 00:22:52,398
God, I'd like to be
a degenerate.

426
00:22:53,132 --> 00:22:54,699
Um, just give me
one second here, sir.

427
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,135
Is this part of it?

428
00:22:56,535 --> 00:22:58,537
Is this going anywhere,
Iacocca?

429
00:22:58,636 --> 00:22:59,839
Just a second, sir.

430
00:22:59,939 --> 00:23:00,973
All right, all right,
that's enough.

431
00:23:01,073 --> 00:23:02,174
Sir, if you just bear
with me...

432
00:23:02,274 --> 00:23:03,242
Turn it off. Lights.

433
00:23:07,712 --> 00:23:10,682
Lee,
in the last three years,

434
00:23:10,783 --> 00:23:12,952
you and your marketing team...

435
00:23:13,385 --> 00:23:18,057
have presided over the worst
sales slump in US history.

436
00:23:19,892 --> 00:23:23,195
Why exactly should Mr. Ford
listen to you?

437
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:28,067
Because we've been
thinking wrong.

438
00:23:31,403 --> 00:23:32,505
Ferrari.

439
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:36,208
Now, they have won four
out of the last five Le Mans.

440
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:39,545
We need to think like Ferrari.

441
00:23:40,112 --> 00:23:41,780
Ferrari makes
fewer cars

442
00:23:41,881 --> 00:23:44,583
in a year
than we make in a day.

443
00:23:44,682 --> 00:23:47,520
We spend more
on toilet paper

444
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,089
than they do
on their entire output.

445
00:23:50,523 --> 00:23:52,791
You want us
to think like them?

446
00:23:52,892 --> 00:23:54,760
Enzo Ferrari will go down
in history

447
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,163
as the greatest
car manufacturer of all time.

448
00:23:58,531 --> 00:23:59,765
Why?

449
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:03,701
Is it because he built
the most cars?

450
00:24:05,437 --> 00:24:06,704
No.

451
00:24:07,573 --> 00:24:09,408
It's because
of what his cars mean.

452
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,011
Victory.

453
00:24:12,545 --> 00:24:14,113
Ferrari wins at Le Mans.

454
00:24:14,213 --> 00:24:17,249
People, they, they want
some of that victory.

455
00:24:19,952 --> 00:24:23,088
What if the Ford badge
meant victory?

456
00:24:23,622 --> 00:24:24,890
And meant it
where it counts,

457
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,393
with the first group
of 17-year-olds in history

458
00:24:27,493 --> 00:24:28,727
with money in their pockets?

459
00:24:28,827 --> 00:24:30,529
This would take years.

460
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:33,165
Decades to test and develop...

461
00:24:33,766 --> 00:24:36,435
a race team capable
of taking out Ferrari.

462
00:24:36,535 --> 00:24:38,037
Ferrari's bankrupt.

463
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:43,842
Enzo has spent every lira
he's got chasing perfection,

464
00:24:43,943 --> 00:24:45,244
and you know something?

465
00:24:45,344 --> 00:24:46,779
He got there.

466
00:24:47,246 --> 00:24:48,713
But now he's broke.

467
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:14,440
You don't have
to give up racing

468
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,674
to get a bloody day job, Ken.

469
00:25:15,774 --> 00:25:16,775
I think I do.

470
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,010
Now, I've had my fun.

471
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,279
It's time to put food
on the table...

472
00:25:20,379 --> 00:25:21,247
and grow up.

473
00:25:21,347 --> 00:25:22,648
The garage didn't pay
the bills.

474
00:25:22,748 --> 00:25:23,849
Now it's locked up.

475
00:25:23,949 --> 00:25:25,551
Racing doesn't
pay them either,

476
00:25:25,651 --> 00:25:26,685
and I keep winning.

477
00:25:26,785 --> 00:25:28,053
Yeah, because you're good.

478
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:30,623
But I can't play the game.

479
00:25:31,023 --> 00:25:33,225
I'm not what they call
a people person.

480
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:35,327
- You don't say.
- And I'm 45 years old.

481
00:25:35,427 --> 00:25:36,996
Do you really think
I'm gonna change?

482
00:25:37,096 --> 00:25:39,932
I'm never gonna get
the good rise.

483
00:25:40,032 --> 00:25:41,133
I started too late.

484
00:25:41,233 --> 00:25:43,068
Because you fought
in the bloody war.

485
00:25:43,902 --> 00:25:48,140
If you stop,
you'll be bloody insufferable.

486
00:25:49,308 --> 00:25:52,444
Let's quit going round
the Wrekin. It's over.

487
00:25:53,045 --> 00:25:54,713
Let's look on the bright side.

488
00:25:54,813 --> 00:25:56,015
Now I can get fat and old,

489
00:25:56,115 --> 00:25:58,851
trim the roses,
and eat pork pies.

- Relax, will you?
- You gotta understand.

494
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:27,680
This is like the Mafia
showing up

495
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:29,114
to buy the Statue of Liberty.

496
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:30,449
Kind of
the opposite, actually.

497
00:26:30,816 --> 00:26:34,119
The press gets wind of this,
the shit will hit the Fangio.

No, no, Mr. Iacocca, no.

502
00:26:43,797 --> 00:26:45,364
It's our cameras.

503
00:26:45,464 --> 00:26:46,865
Just for history.

504

Four-liter Colombo engine.

One man assembles
the entire engine

506
00:26:55,941 --> 00:26:57,276
by himself.

507
00:26:58,977 --> 00:27:02,081
Another man assembles
the transmission.

508
00:27:02,981 --> 00:27:04,550
Everything hand-built.

509

This merger
between our companies

514
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:34,848
will form two entities.

515
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:39,651
Ford-Ferrari,

516
00:27:39,753 --> 00:27:41,220
90 percent owned by Ford,

517
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,789
who controls all production.

00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,130
Secondly, Ferrari-Ford,
the race team,

519

90 percent owned by Ferrari.

520
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:02,541
In order to secure this,
Ford will pay the sum...

Excuse me.

It was a bad idea
from the start.

555

What exactly did he say?

556
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:42,320
He said Ford makes
ugly little cars,

557
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:43,790
and we make 'em...

558

You're Henry Ford II.

566

We're gonna build a race car.

under the finish line
at Le Mans.

574
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:08,340
And I will be there
to watch it.

575
00:34:09,142 --> 00:34:11,077
Here they come.
Go, go, go, go.

576
00:34:15,081 --> 00:34:16,048
Assholes.

577
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:17,250
You're really pathetic.

578
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:18,251
I'm so sorry, girls.

579
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,651

God damn it.

582
00:34:23,222 --> 00:34:24,257
Do I gotta deal with this?

583
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:25,892
It's already taken care of.

584
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:31,264
Sorry about that.
So, yeah, 289 cubic inch V8.

00:34:31,363 --> 00:34:32,497
Far out.

586
00:34:32,597 --> 00:34:34,432
Extensive rework
of AC Ace's front end.

587
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:36,501
And a stronger rear diff
to handle the torque.

588
00:34:36,601 --> 00:34:38,171
How's she handle
a quarter mile?

589
00:34:38,637 --> 00:34:40,973
Well, now, I'm not saying
you should go drag racing,

590
00:34:41,073 --> 00:34:42,507
but a quarter mile's 13.6.

591
00:34:42,607 --> 00:34:43,810
Yeah.

592
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,443
- Is that good?
- Oh, that's real good.

593
00:34:45,544 --> 00:34:48,513
He sold that same car
three times this week.

594
00:34:48,613 --> 00:34:50,750
- You take cash? Is cash okay?
- Cash is okay.

595
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:53,186
Yeah, mister, you just bought
yourself one hell of a sport car.

596
00:34:53,286 --> 00:34:54,653
All right.

597
00:34:55,822 --> 00:34:58,257
Tell you what,
I'm gonna... Phil!

598
00:34:58,356 --> 00:34:59,624
I'm gonna pass you off
to my colleague here.

599
00:34:59,724 --> 00:35:01,027
He gonna take care of you.

600
00:35:01,127 --> 00:35:02,829
- Phil, Wyatt.
- Hello, Wyatt.

601
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:04,396
I'm gonna steal him
for one second.

602
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,799
You take the payment.

603
00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:08,567
Whatever you do,
do not let him take that car.

604
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:09,836
That's Jeff Blitzer's car.

605
00:35:09,936 --> 00:35:12,104
And Frank Collins'
and Steve McQueen's.

606
00:35:12,205 --> 00:35:14,406
Shit. I forgot about McQueen.

607
00:35:17,342 --> 00:35:18,577
Morning.

608
00:35:19,111 --> 00:35:20,345
Can I help you?

609
00:35:21,446 --> 00:35:22,748
Carroll Shelby?

610
00:35:23,883 --> 00:35:24,917
Maybe.

611
00:35:26,351 --> 00:35:28,821
Lee Iacocca, Ford Motor.

612
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,625
What's with the wrench?

613
00:35:34,126 --> 00:35:35,995
That? Oh, long story.

614
00:35:36,796 --> 00:35:39,866
We are just going from strength
to strength here, Lee.

615
00:35:40,398 --> 00:35:43,069
Terrific sales,
we're killing it on the track.

616
00:35:43,169 --> 00:35:44,569
Now, I know I owe Ford

617
00:35:44,669 --> 00:35:45,670
for that last batch
of engines...

618
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:47,306
Mr. Shelby,
I can assure you

619
00:35:47,405 --> 00:35:48,506
I'm not here for money

620
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:50,743
that you might owe Ford
for spare parts.

621
00:35:52,044 --> 00:35:53,478
You're not?

622
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,580
No, I'm not.

623
00:35:56,414 --> 00:35:57,682
Okay.

624
00:35:57,783 --> 00:36:00,452
I'm here on behalf
of Mr. Ford, Henry Ford II.

625
00:36:00,552 --> 00:36:03,222
Suppose, um, hypothetically,

626
00:36:03,322 --> 00:36:05,291
that he wanted his company

627
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,525
to win the 24 Hours
of Le Mans.

628
00:36:08,593 --> 00:36:09,996
You're one
of the only Americans

629
00:36:10,096 --> 00:36:11,529
that's ever done it...

630
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,032
so I'm wondering...

631
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:15,067
what's it take?

632
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,805
Hypothetically?

633
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,174
Hypothetically.

634
00:36:23,508 --> 00:36:25,477
It takes something
money can't buy.

635
00:36:26,544 --> 00:36:28,014
Money can buy speed.

636
00:36:29,547 --> 00:36:31,416
But it isn't about speed, Lee.

637
00:36:32,385 --> 00:36:34,020
It's not just like
those other tracks

638
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,455
where all you do is turn
to the left for four hours.

639
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:41,193
To win that race,
you need a car

640
00:36:41,294 --> 00:36:43,595
that's light enough to do 200
on the straightaways

641
00:36:43,695 --> 00:36:44,830
but strong enough
to keep that up

642
00:36:44,931 --> 00:36:46,999
for 3,000 miles
without a break.

643
00:36:49,035 --> 00:36:50,770
Not just the best car

644
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,671
y'all have ever made,
but better than anything

645
00:36:52,772 --> 00:36:54,673
that Enzo Ferrari
shows up with that year.

646
00:36:54,774 --> 00:36:56,474
And that just gets you
to the green flag.

647
00:36:56,574 --> 00:36:58,543
That's where your problems
really start.

648
00:37:00,512 --> 00:37:02,148
Is everything okay?

649
00:37:02,248 --> 00:37:04,216
Go away.

650
00:37:11,556 --> 00:37:13,558
So you're saying
it's challenging.

651
00:37:15,928 --> 00:37:18,097
Look, it's not even
a track, Lee.

652
00:37:18,764 --> 00:37:21,100
Le Mans is eight and a half
miles of country road.

653
00:37:22,435 --> 00:37:25,704
It's narrow, ungraded,
it's rough.

654
00:37:25,805 --> 00:37:28,874
There's no camber
on the turns, no rails.

655
00:37:31,476 --> 00:37:33,245
You gotta do that
for 24 hours.

656
00:37:35,147 --> 00:37:36,614
Twenty-four hours, Lee.

657
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:39,718
That means night.

658
00:37:40,252 --> 00:37:43,488
Half that race is in the dark.
You can't see shit.

659
00:37:45,024 --> 00:37:47,126
Cars coming up on you
out of nowhere.

660
00:37:48,593 --> 00:37:51,663
Drivers stumbling around
the track, pouring blood.

661
00:37:52,465 --> 00:37:54,266
Maybe one of 'em
is your friend. Maybe...

662
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:56,701
Maybe he's on fire.

663
00:37:58,437 --> 00:38:00,373
You're exhausted,
you're hungry...

664
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,476
can't remember your name,
what country you're in.

665
00:38:04,343 --> 00:38:07,947
And all of a sudden, you realize
you're doing 198 on a straight.

666
00:38:11,683 --> 00:38:13,252
And if anything goes wrong...

667
00:38:14,086 --> 00:38:17,056
you blow a gasket,
a five-cent washer...

668
00:38:17,555 --> 00:38:19,225
that's it, whole thing's over.

669
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:21,559
Ferrari wins again.

670
00:38:22,395 --> 00:38:24,964
Just like he won last year
and the year before that.

671
00:38:25,297 --> 00:38:26,732
And the year before that.

672
00:38:30,469 --> 00:38:31,703
Yeah.

673
00:38:32,304 --> 00:38:33,538
It's challenging.

674
00:38:34,774 --> 00:38:36,175
So you don't think...

675
00:38:36,876 --> 00:38:38,210
that Ford Motor Company
can build

676
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,545
the greatest race car
the world's ever seen?

677
00:38:40,645 --> 00:38:43,182
You think that
we are incapable

678
00:38:43,516 --> 00:38:45,017
of winning an event like that?

679
00:38:45,418 --> 00:38:47,619
Even if we had
a brilliant partner?

680
00:38:50,356 --> 00:38:53,959
Even if we wrote a, uh,
blank check?

681
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:03,635
What I'm saying is,
you can't buy a win, Lee.

682
00:39:06,405 --> 00:39:10,276
But maybe you could buy
the guy who gets you a shot.

683
00:39:27,293 --> 00:39:31,764
A new transmission, axles,
shocks all around,

684
00:39:31,864 --> 00:39:35,167
ditch the body and the tires,
you have yourself a contender.

685
00:39:36,235 --> 00:39:38,437
Anything on this beauty
that does work?

686
00:39:38,537 --> 00:39:41,207
The mirrors are outstanding.

687
00:39:41,307 --> 00:39:42,541
I saw that walking up.

688
00:39:43,309 --> 00:39:47,645
So, what, you just passing
on an evening stroll?

689
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:50,983
Actually, Bulldog,
I have a proposition for you.

690
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:55,221
You're gonna build a car
to beat Old Man Ferrari...

691
00:39:55,321 --> 00:39:57,089
- Yeah.
- ...with Ford?

692
00:39:57,189 --> 00:39:59,325
With a Ford?

693
00:39:59,425 --> 00:40:00,692
Correct.

694
00:40:00,793 --> 00:40:02,627
And how long did you tell them
that you needed?

695
00:40:02,728 --> 00:40:04,396
Two, three hundred years?

696
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:05,998
Ninety days.

697
00:40:09,969 --> 00:40:12,938
All right, so let's just look
at this for a moment.

698
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,174
And for argument's sake,

699
00:40:15,274 --> 00:40:17,743
let's just forget about
the whole 90-day thing.

700
00:40:17,843 --> 00:40:19,478
So let's just pretend you've got
all the money in the world

701
00:40:19,578 --> 00:40:21,614
and all the time in the world.

702
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:23,415
- I like the sound of that.
- All right.

703
00:40:23,516 --> 00:40:24,583
So...

704
00:40:25,151 --> 00:40:28,087
you think that Ford
are gonna let you build

705
00:40:28,888 --> 00:40:31,723
the car that you want...

706
00:40:32,258 --> 00:40:33,792
the way you want it?

707
00:40:33,893 --> 00:40:36,896
The Ford Motor Company?

708
00:40:38,097 --> 00:40:39,231
Those guys?

709
00:40:40,466 --> 00:40:41,600
Have you ever been to Detroit?

710
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:44,637
They have floors
and floors of lawyers

711
00:40:44,737 --> 00:40:46,572
and millions
of marketing guys,

712
00:40:46,671 --> 00:40:47,806
and they're all gonna want
to meet you.

713
00:40:47,907 --> 00:40:49,375
They're gonna want
to get their photo taken

714
00:40:49,475 --> 00:40:50,543
with the great
Carroll Shelby,

715
00:40:50,643 --> 00:40:51,777
and they're gonna
kiss your ass

716
00:40:51,877 --> 00:40:53,245
and go back
to their lovely offices...

717
00:40:53,879 --> 00:40:55,915
and they're gonna work out
new ways to screw you.

718
00:40:56,015 --> 00:40:58,683
Why? Because
they can't help it.

719
00:40:58,784 --> 00:41:00,319
Because they just want
to please their boss

720
00:41:00,419 --> 00:41:03,756
who wants please his boss
who wants to please his boss.

721
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,592
And they hate themselves
for it.

722
00:41:06,691 --> 00:41:08,394
But deep down...

723
00:41:08,494 --> 00:41:10,396
who they hate even more

724
00:41:10,496 --> 00:41:11,664
are guys like you,

725
00:41:11,764 --> 00:41:13,032
because you're not like them,

726
00:41:13,132 --> 00:41:14,767
because you don't think
like them,

727
00:41:14,867 --> 00:41:16,902
because you're different.

728
00:41:18,137 --> 00:41:20,072
It's coming straight
from the Deuce.

729
00:41:22,575 --> 00:41:23,676
He's serious.

730
00:41:23,976 --> 00:41:25,177
They're gonna put
real money behind it.

731
00:41:28,781 --> 00:41:30,115
I'll bet they are.

732
00:41:31,283 --> 00:41:32,518
You know why?

733
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:35,020
Because someone,
and I'm not saying who,

734
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:41,093
someone has told them that
this is actually possible.

735
00:41:41,427 --> 00:41:42,461
Look...

736
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:44,096
this Sunday at Cloverfield,

737
00:41:44,196 --> 00:41:45,564
they're launching
the new Mustang.

738
00:41:45,664 --> 00:41:47,299
They're gonna announce
the race program.

739
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:49,868
Just come on by.

740
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:54,773
Come take a look.
Listen to my speech.

741
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:56,275
I'm making a speech.

742
00:41:56,675 --> 00:41:58,811
Bring Peter. He'll love it.

743
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,248
All right, Shel.

744
00:42:04,483 --> 00:42:06,085
See you Sunday.

745
00:42:09,288 --> 00:42:10,756
Whoa.

746
00:42:11,357 --> 00:42:14,226
Dad, look at that.

747
00:42:15,327 --> 00:42:16,495
Huh.

748
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:20,499
The Ford Mustang.
What do you think?

749
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:25,971
I think
it's a secretary's car.

750
00:42:27,673 --> 00:42:29,108
I like it.

751
00:42:30,776 --> 00:42:31,745
Oh.

752
00:42:31,844 --> 00:42:33,545
Excu... Excuse me.

753
00:42:35,247 --> 00:42:36,982
Would you,
would you not do that?

754
00:42:37,516 --> 00:42:39,518
Oh. Sorry.

755
00:42:42,721 --> 00:42:45,391
Oh, er, is this,
is this your son?

756
00:42:46,258 --> 00:42:47,459
Yes, it is.

757
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:50,229
Would you ask him to keep
his hands off the paintwork?

758
00:42:50,764 --> 00:42:51,797
No, no, no, Peter.

759
00:42:51,897 --> 00:42:53,265
You're okay.
Who are you?

760
00:42:53,767 --> 00:42:56,702
Leo Beebe, senior executive vice
president, Ford Motor Company.

761
00:42:56,802 --> 00:42:57,803
Ah.

762
00:42:57,903 --> 00:42:59,138
I'm responsible for the launch

763
00:42:59,238 --> 00:43:00,005
of the Mustang.

764
00:43:00,105 --> 00:43:01,741
Ah! At least now we know

765
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,875
who's responsible.

766
00:43:02,975 --> 00:43:03,976
Don't get me wrong, Lenny.

767
00:43:04,076 --> 00:43:06,979
- Leo.
- It looks fantastic.

768
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:09,014
But inside,
it's a lump of lard

769
00:43:09,114 --> 00:43:10,449
dressed up to fool the public.

770
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:12,484
My advice is,

771
00:43:12,584 --> 00:43:13,986
lose the inline-six

772
00:43:14,086 --> 00:43:15,721
and that idiotic
three-speed,

773
00:43:15,821 --> 00:43:19,391
shorten the wheelbase,
somehow lose half a ton,

774
00:43:19,491 --> 00:43:20,659
and lower the price.

775
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,728
Dad.

776
00:43:21,827 --> 00:43:22,895
But even then,

777
00:43:22,995 --> 00:43:24,563
I'd still choose
a Chevy Chevelle.

778
00:43:25,664 --> 00:43:28,334
And that's
a fucking terrible car.

779
00:43:29,501 --> 00:43:31,337
<i>How are we doing
up there, Steve?</i>

780
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,539
There's Cloverfield,
Mr. Shelby.

781
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,674
Oh, yeah.

782
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:38,177
You mind if I take
a shot at the landing?

783
00:43:38,277 --> 00:43:39,445
Uh...

784
00:43:39,545 --> 00:43:40,679
No, no, no. I mean it.

785
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,614
I flew B-29s
out of San Antone in '44.

786
00:43:42,715 --> 00:43:43,949
You're kidding.

787
00:43:44,316 --> 00:43:45,884
- I did.
- Okay.

788
00:43:45,984 --> 00:43:47,152
Carroll, what are you doing?

789
00:43:47,252 --> 00:43:48,788
- Does he know how to fly?
- Carroll.

790
00:43:48,887 --> 00:43:51,457
I had an instructor tell me,
he said...

791
00:43:51,557 --> 00:43:53,926
Don, I would say it's probably
a good time to buckle up.

792
00:43:54,026 --> 00:43:56,095
"...do everybody a favor,
stay on the ground."

793
00:43:57,096 --> 00:43:58,497
That's a true story.

794
00:43:58,597 --> 00:43:59,766
- Oh, no.
- Oh, shit.

795
00:43:59,865 --> 00:44:01,567
- God damn it.
- Here we go.

796
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:02,802
<i>This is the car</i>

797
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:04,804
<i>you never expected
from Detroit.</i>

798
00:44:07,841 --> 00:44:10,476
All right. Let's go.

799
00:44:12,378 --> 00:44:13,780
Not staying, Ken?

800
00:44:14,279 --> 00:44:16,750
Ah, it's a bloody pig
in a poke, isn't it?

801
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:18,050
Oh, here they come now.

802
00:44:22,888 --> 00:44:25,524
- Wait. Are they crashing?
- Oh, Lord.

803
00:44:25,624 --> 00:44:26,992
Who's the pilot?

804
00:44:27,092 --> 00:44:29,027
My guess, Peter...

805
00:44:32,097 --> 00:44:33,499
it's someone we know.

806
00:44:34,868 --> 00:44:36,168
<i>Everything all right
up there?</i>

807
00:44:36,736 --> 00:44:38,103
Oh, no.

808
00:44:38,203 --> 00:44:39,538
- No!
- Hang on.

809
00:44:39,638 --> 00:44:42,074
Oh, shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

810
00:44:42,174 --> 00:44:45,745
Shit. Shit. Shit.

811
00:44:45,845 --> 00:44:47,679
Tell you what,
that's like riding a bike.

812
00:44:54,386 --> 00:44:55,822
Talk about making an entrance.

813
00:44:55,921 --> 00:44:57,689
- Shelby...
- Good grief.

814
00:44:57,791 --> 00:44:59,158
- Shelby!
- All right!

815
00:44:59,258 --> 00:45:01,460
- Over here. Over here!
- Shelby!

816
00:45:01,693 --> 00:45:02,896
How y'all doing?

817
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:04,096
Can I get
your autograph, please?

818
00:45:04,196 --> 00:45:05,297
Can I get
your autograph, sir?

819
00:45:05,397 --> 00:45:06,866
Carroll,
this is Roy Lunn.

820
00:45:06,965 --> 00:45:08,133
Old Roy here is developing

821
00:45:08,233 --> 00:45:09,468
the prototype over in England.

822
00:45:09,568 --> 00:45:11,738
Oh, hell, I know Roy.
Good to see you, Roy.

823
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:13,138
Welcome
to the madhouse, Shelby.

824
00:45:13,238 --> 00:45:14,774
Ford wheeled out the entire
executive committee

825
00:45:14,874 --> 00:45:15,842
for this one.

826
00:45:15,941 --> 00:45:17,376
Hold that thought.

827
00:45:17,877 --> 00:45:18,745
Ah.

828
00:45:18,845 --> 00:45:20,212
Hello, Mr. Lindbergh.

829
00:45:20,312 --> 00:45:22,749
You like that?
Hey, Peter, how you doing?

830
00:45:22,849 --> 00:45:24,149
- Mr. Shelby.
- Good to see you.

831
00:45:24,249 --> 00:45:26,552
Are you building a car
that's gonna beat Ferrari?

832
00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:30,155
Well, we're gonna go
to Le Mans, that's for sure.

833
00:45:30,255 --> 00:45:32,291
And if we get across that finish
line first, we're gonna win.

834
00:45:32,391 --> 00:45:34,293
Carroll, allow me
to introduce Leo Beebe,

835
00:45:34,393 --> 00:45:36,428
senior vice president,
Ford Motor.

836
00:45:36,528 --> 00:45:38,096
Oh, sure. Yeah.
A pleasure, Mr. Beebe.

837
00:45:38,197 --> 00:45:39,698
- Thank you for coming.
- Say hello to Ken Miles

838
00:45:39,799 --> 00:45:40,966
- and his son, Peter.
- Yeah.

839
00:45:41,066 --> 00:45:43,569
- We've, um... we met.
- We, uh... we met.

840
00:45:44,403 --> 00:45:45,571
Yeah.

841
00:45:46,104 --> 00:45:47,339
Didn't we?

842
00:45:47,439 --> 00:45:49,308
So, um, well...

843
00:45:49,776 --> 00:45:51,778
I'll take Petey for some pop.

844
00:45:52,377 --> 00:45:54,146
Good luck
with these guys, Shel.

845
00:45:54,246 --> 00:45:56,215
- Bye, Mr. Shelby.
- See you, Pete.

846
00:45:56,816 --> 00:45:58,417
Don't worry, he's gonna stay.

847
00:45:59,451 --> 00:46:02,254
So, you two get a chance
to talk on the plane?

848
00:46:03,155 --> 00:46:04,356
Yeah. Uh...

849
00:46:04,656 --> 00:46:07,626
Carroll, why don't we just
step this way for a second?

850
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:16,368
Look, it's pro forma.
It's window dressing.

851
00:46:16,468 --> 00:46:18,136
But there's gotta be
a sense of give-and-take

852
00:46:18,237 --> 00:46:19,571
between you and...

853
00:46:19,671 --> 00:46:20,940
you know.

854
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:22,007
No, I don't.

855
00:46:22,107 --> 00:46:23,342
The group.

856
00:46:23,442 --> 00:46:24,543
The group?

857
00:46:24,643 --> 00:46:25,577
Senior creatives, Carroll.

858
00:46:25,677 --> 00:46:28,146
Just to make sure
everybody's comfortable.

859
00:46:28,714 --> 00:46:29,816
Well, I'm confused, Lee.

860
00:46:29,916 --> 00:46:31,450
'Cause up until
this moment, right now,

861
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:32,785
I was comfortable.

862
00:46:33,585 --> 00:46:35,855
You should take a look
out there, Carroll. Hmm?

863
00:46:35,955 --> 00:46:37,422
What do you see?

864
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:38,992
You know what I see?

865
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:40,559
I see a machine.

866
00:46:40,659 --> 00:46:42,661
I see 10,000 moving parts,

867
00:46:42,762 --> 00:46:43,930
moving hopefully in harmony,

868
00:46:44,029 --> 00:46:45,464
and it's my job to make it so.

869
00:46:45,564 --> 00:46:47,000
It's my job
to guide you through it.

870
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:49,034
I am here
to help you, Carroll.

871
00:46:49,134 --> 00:46:50,770
But you gotta trust me.

872
00:46:51,771 --> 00:46:53,006
- Excuse me, Lee.
- Carroll...

873
00:46:53,672 --> 00:46:55,474
do not step on that stage
if you don't trust me.

874
00:46:55,574 --> 00:46:58,477
<i>Please welcome
Mr. Carroll Shelby.</i>

875
00:46:58,577 --> 00:46:59,979
Gotta go.

876
00:47:02,815 --> 00:47:05,250
Shelby... Oh.
Shelby.

877
00:47:06,718 --> 00:47:07,754
What'd he say?

878
00:47:07,854 --> 00:47:09,187
He gets the drill.

879
00:47:12,257 --> 00:47:14,126
<i>Thank you.</i>

880
00:47:14,226 --> 00:47:16,395
<i>Well, if my daddy
was here today...</i>

881
00:47:16,495 --> 00:47:18,163
<i>he'd tell me to sit on down</i>

882
00:47:18,263 --> 00:47:21,300
<i>and leave the yakking
to the college boys...</i>

883
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,569
<i>so, like my cars,
I'll make this fast.</i>

884
00:47:25,939 --> 00:47:28,640
<i>When I was 10 years old,
Pops said to me, "Son...</i>

885
00:47:29,308 --> 00:47:31,176
<i>"it's a truly lucky man</i>

886
00:47:31,276 --> 00:47:33,478
<i>"who knows what he wants
to do in this world.</i>

887
00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:36,648
<i>"'Cause that man will
never work a day in his life."</i>

888
00:47:36,749 --> 00:47:39,384
<i>But there are a few,
a precious few,</i>

889
00:47:39,484 --> 00:47:41,620
<i>and, hell, I don't know
if they're lucky or not.</i>

890
00:47:42,454 --> 00:47:43,589
<i>But there are a few people</i>

891
00:47:43,689 --> 00:47:45,390
<i>who find something
they have to do.</i>

892
00:47:46,793 --> 00:47:48,427
<i>Something obsesses 'em.</i>

893
00:47:49,461 --> 00:47:51,229
<i>Something that
if they can't do it,</i>

894
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:53,332
<i>it's gonna drive them
clean out of their mind.</i>

895
00:47:54,366 --> 00:47:56,602
<i>I'm that guy.</i>

896
00:47:56,702 --> 00:47:59,504
<i>And I know one other man
feels exactly the same.</i>

897
00:48:01,007 --> 00:48:02,274
<i>His name...</i>

898
00:48:04,509 --> 00:48:06,378
<i>His name is Mr. Henry Ford.</i>

899
00:48:06,478 --> 00:48:09,114
Yeah! Whoo!

900
00:48:11,084 --> 00:48:12,752
<i>And together,
we're gonna build</i>

901
00:48:12,852 --> 00:48:14,821
<i>the fastest automobiles
in the world.</i>

902
00:48:18,024 --> 00:48:20,827
<i>And we're gonna make history,
too, at Le Mans.</i>

903
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:26,465
- Let's go.
- What?

904
00:48:26,565 --> 00:48:28,367
<i>My name is Carroll Shelby.</i>

905
00:48:29,068 --> 00:48:30,602
<i>I build race cars.</i>

906
00:48:53,993 --> 00:48:55,795
No. Whatever it is, no.

907
00:48:58,031 --> 00:48:59,231
No.

908
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:01,134
Thirty minutes.

909
00:49:01,433 --> 00:49:04,269
Ah, just... I'm spent.

910
00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:06,873
- I wanna have a bath.
- You're gonna wanna see this.

911
00:49:07,774 --> 00:49:08,875
Trust me.

912
00:49:09,876 --> 00:49:12,711
Thirty minutes. I'll have you
back for meatloaf and gravy.

913
00:49:15,915 --> 00:49:17,083
Thirty minutes.

914
00:49:17,182 --> 00:49:18,617
Yeah.

915
00:49:37,036 --> 00:49:38,570
Bloody hell.

916
00:49:44,409 --> 00:49:46,145
Fresh off the plane
from England.

917
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:52,217
Now, she's still a little
on the rare side of cooked.

918
00:50:01,693 --> 00:50:03,228
Whoa! Come on.

919
00:50:15,808 --> 00:50:17,342
Interesting.

920
00:50:34,127 --> 00:50:35,061
Well?

921
00:50:35,161 --> 00:50:36,394
It's awful.

922
00:50:36,495 --> 00:50:37,897
It's worse than awful.

923
00:50:37,997 --> 00:50:39,297
Yeah, it doesn't track.

924
00:50:39,397 --> 00:50:41,768
You know,
the third gear is too high.

925
00:50:42,601 --> 00:50:45,270
Torque is not reaching
the road.

926
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:49,274
Steering's loose because
the front end gets light.

927
00:50:49,374 --> 00:50:51,778
And over 140,
it thinks it's a...

928
00:50:51,878 --> 00:50:52,812
Airplane.

929
00:50:52,912 --> 00:50:54,113
Yeah.

930
00:50:54,213 --> 00:50:56,448
It wants to lift off
and fly to Hawaii.

931
00:50:59,152 --> 00:51:00,452
Anything else?

932
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:07,692
One sec.

933
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:39,292
You were back late last night.

934
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,659
Yeah.

935
00:51:44,263 --> 00:51:46,732
- Were you working?
- Mmm.

936
00:51:50,136 --> 00:51:51,636
So, you didn't go anyplace?

937
00:51:52,704 --> 00:51:53,940
What?

938
00:51:55,707 --> 00:51:57,977
Well, I'm asking, did you
go anyplace last night?

939
00:52:00,679 --> 00:52:01,881
Mollie.

940
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:03,783
It's a simple question.

941
00:52:06,118 --> 00:52:07,753
And I answered, didn't I?

942
00:52:08,154 --> 00:52:09,554
What was the answer?

943
00:52:11,389 --> 00:52:12,624
Is something up, love?

944
00:52:14,961 --> 00:52:16,295
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

945
00:52:16,394 --> 00:52:18,130
You're driving very fast.

946
00:52:18,231 --> 00:52:19,332
Oh, am I? Am I?

947
00:52:19,431 --> 00:52:20,733
Yes, you are.

948
00:52:22,969 --> 00:52:24,871
Bloody hell! What are you...
The hell is this?

949
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:27,139
Well, you tell me,
'cause I don't know.

950
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,275
Right, slow down!

951
00:52:29,374 --> 00:52:31,143
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Mollie!

952
00:52:33,678 --> 00:52:35,915
Please slow it down,
all right?

953
00:52:36,015 --> 00:52:37,817
You trying to kill us
or something?

954
00:52:37,917 --> 00:52:39,919
- Well, I thought we love this shit.
- What?

955
00:52:41,821 --> 00:52:44,389
- Bloody hell!
- It's a bit of racing fun. No?

956
00:52:44,489 --> 00:52:45,758
No, no, no.
It's not the same at all.

957
00:52:45,858 --> 00:52:47,994
Well, I think it's thrilling!

958
00:52:48,493 --> 00:52:49,962
All right.

959
00:52:50,062 --> 00:52:51,764
Look, I saw you, all right?

960
00:52:52,999 --> 00:52:55,400
I saw you leaving with Shelby,
and I saw you coming back.

961
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,169
Okay. Shit.
Okay, but slow it...

962
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:59,805
And then all day you've got
that stupid look on your face.

963
00:52:59,906 --> 00:53:02,141
Mollie, slow down.
You're too close here.

964
00:53:04,877 --> 00:53:07,479
Mollie, put on the brakes
right now...

965
00:53:07,579 --> 00:53:09,681
Not until you tell me
what's going on!

966
00:53:09,782 --> 00:53:12,218
All right.
I went to look at a car.

967
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:14,186
- With Shelby?
- With Shelby.

968
00:53:14,287 --> 00:53:16,488
- A racing car?
- Sort of.

969
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:19,524
There's a corner coming.
You'd better hold on.

970
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,495
Oh! Are you gonna lift your
foot off at all through this?

971
00:53:23,595 --> 00:53:25,164
No, 'cause I like
a clean racing line.

972
00:53:25,264 --> 00:53:26,299
Slow down!

973
00:53:30,303 --> 00:53:31,203
Okay.

974
00:53:31,304 --> 00:53:32,805
Shel offered me a job.

975
00:53:32,905 --> 00:53:36,242
Ford has a car that they want
to put up against a Ferrari.

976
00:53:36,342 --> 00:53:38,210
- You told me you were done.
- That's it. Now, slow...

977
00:53:38,311 --> 00:53:39,845
I didn't say yes.

978
00:53:39,946 --> 00:53:41,247
Slow down.

979
00:53:41,347 --> 00:53:42,915
You told me you quit.

980
00:53:43,883 --> 00:53:46,419
- I don't understand.
- Get fat and old, you said.

981
00:53:46,518 --> 00:53:48,120
Fat and old.

982
00:53:52,024 --> 00:53:53,525
- I don't understand.
- That's what you told me.

983
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:55,328
I don't understand.

984
00:53:55,428 --> 00:53:56,862
Are you upset
because I said I was done

985
00:53:56,963 --> 00:53:59,765
or because
I looked at a race car?

986
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,769
Just don't lie to me, Ken.

987
00:54:05,204 --> 00:54:06,806
Don't make it a secret,

988
00:54:06,906 --> 00:54:08,207
what you want
or what you feel,

989
00:54:08,307 --> 00:54:11,243
just because you think
it's gonna make me happy.

990
00:54:13,346 --> 00:54:15,580
Moll, I don't even know
what I feel.

991
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,123
If you do this...

992
00:54:26,792 --> 00:54:29,061
then he better be
paying you this time.

993
00:54:31,197 --> 00:54:34,233
'Cause I can't work any more
hours and look after Peter.

994
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:35,667
You know,
the IRS have the garage.

995
00:54:35,768 --> 00:54:38,037
I'm not losing my home.

996
00:54:38,636 --> 00:54:40,572
It's 200 a day.

997
00:54:43,242 --> 00:54:44,877
Plus expenses.

998
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:48,948
Are you shitting me?

999
00:54:49,315 --> 00:54:51,649
But I haven't decided.

1000
00:54:54,353 --> 00:54:55,955
$200 a day?

1001
00:54:58,523 --> 00:54:59,859
Are you nuts?

1002
00:55:23,182 --> 00:55:26,285
Look at this.
This is ridiculous. Here.

1003
00:55:26,385 --> 00:55:29,422
So, Shel, grabbing air.

1004
00:55:29,522 --> 00:55:31,057
That's the problem.

1005
00:55:31,757 --> 00:55:35,428
Over 90, air's getting in,
not getting out.

1006
00:55:35,528 --> 00:55:37,430
It's the nose,
I can feel it in the wheel.

1007
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:38,596
Mr. Miles,
if there's a problem,

1008
00:55:38,696 --> 00:55:39,732
the computer will find it.

1009
00:55:39,832 --> 00:55:41,000
- All right.
- Charlie,

1010
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,635
get some Scotch tape
and a ball of wool.

1011
00:55:44,569 --> 00:55:46,739
All right. Good, good, good.

1012
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:50,642
So, now let's just, uh,
get all of this junk out.

1013
00:55:50,743 --> 00:55:51,777
Right, Pops?

1014
00:55:51,877 --> 00:55:53,245
Yeah, yeah. I concur.

1015
00:55:53,345 --> 00:55:54,712
Come on, guys.

1016
00:55:56,982 --> 00:55:58,217
What are they doing?

1017
00:55:58,751 --> 00:56:00,352
Making your car faster.

1018
00:56:08,127 --> 00:56:09,228
There. Right there.

1019
00:56:09,328 --> 00:56:10,595
Airflow's getting stuck.

1020
00:56:13,598 --> 00:56:16,435
I see it.
Yarn blows straight up.

1021
00:56:16,535 --> 00:56:18,003
- Yep.
- The front's lifting.

1022
00:56:18,104 --> 00:56:19,738
Damn, he's right.

1023
00:56:30,216 --> 00:56:33,552
This car wants to go faster.
I feel it.

1024
00:56:33,651 --> 00:56:35,554
Any lighter,
we're getting fragile.

1025
00:56:36,021 --> 00:56:37,923
Took 70 pounds out of her
in the last week.

1026
00:56:38,023 --> 00:56:40,826
She's outputting max horsepower
from this displacement.

1027
00:56:40,926 --> 00:56:43,095
So put in a bigger engine.

1028
00:56:43,195 --> 00:56:44,997
Where we gonna put it?
On the roof?

1029
00:56:47,933 --> 00:56:49,602
Managed to make it
52 pounds lighter

1030
00:56:49,701 --> 00:56:51,669
than the NASCAR unit.

1031
00:56:56,108 --> 00:56:58,577
All-new aluminum
cylinder heads...

1032
00:56:59,245 --> 00:57:02,448
vibration dampeners,
water pump, smaller valves.

1033
00:57:02,781 --> 00:57:04,283
We call it the Beast.

1034
00:57:04,917 --> 00:57:06,218
Yeah, I can see why,

1035
00:57:06,318 --> 00:57:07,419
but how's it gonna fit

1036
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,488
without a redesign
of the engine bed?

1037
00:57:09,588 --> 00:57:10,688
Well, it certainly
wasn't easy.

1038
00:57:10,789 --> 00:57:11,957
Good morning, gentlemen.
Mr. Shelby.

1039
00:57:12,057 --> 00:57:16,195
So, you already put that
in a GT40?

1040
00:57:16,495 --> 00:57:18,696
I'm afraid we have.

1041
00:57:24,303 --> 00:57:25,838
I'll be damned.

1042
00:57:26,405 --> 00:57:27,773
Well, it's heavy, of course.

1043
00:57:27,873 --> 00:57:29,141
Problems with the handling,
especially the stopping.

1044
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:31,377
- I can show you the data.
- What problems?

1045
00:57:31,477 --> 00:57:32,611
Understeers a little, but...

1046
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:34,313
Can I borrow that?

1047
00:57:34,413 --> 00:57:35,614
Just a second. Thank you.

1048
00:57:35,713 --> 00:57:36,615
Ken!

1049
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:40,619
Ken, perhaps you want to check
with HQ before you test...

1050
00:57:40,718 --> 00:57:42,087
What did he say?

1051
00:57:42,188 --> 00:57:43,355
We should ask...

1052
00:57:43,455 --> 00:57:44,689
Right.

1053
00:57:46,859 --> 00:57:49,995
Oh, yes!

1054
00:57:57,136 --> 00:57:59,638
Mr. Shelby,
welcome to Dearborn.

1055
00:57:59,738 --> 00:58:01,106
What are you doing
at a test track?

1056
00:58:01,207 --> 00:58:03,442
You're gonna get Castrol oil
all over that nice suit.

1057
00:58:03,542 --> 00:58:04,810
Ah, I wanted to hear
your thoughts

1058
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:06,011
on a few planning decisions.

1059
00:58:06,111 --> 00:58:07,680
You know,
personnel for Le Mans.

1060
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:09,215
Well,
it's a hell of a lineup.

1061
00:58:09,315 --> 00:58:11,050
Ken Miles, Phil Hill,

1062
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:12,918
Chris Amon, Bruce McLaren.

1063
00:58:13,018 --> 00:58:15,487
Hill's a lock.
Amon, McLaren, too.

1064
00:58:15,588 --> 00:58:17,323
We're less sure about Miles.

1065
00:58:17,423 --> 00:58:18,757
We like Richie Ginther...

1066
00:58:19,158 --> 00:58:21,727
Masten Gregory,
Bob Bondurant.

1067
00:58:22,261 --> 00:58:24,463
Well, you're gonna want
the best driver for the car.

1068
00:58:24,563 --> 00:58:26,165
Understands the machine.

1069
00:58:26,265 --> 00:58:27,566
That's Ken.

1070
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:29,568
Oh! Yes!

1071
00:58:30,302 --> 00:58:33,772
More of that, please.
More of that, my girl.

1072
00:58:33,872 --> 00:58:36,208
I may not get the finer points
of racing, Mr. Shelby,

1073
00:58:36,308 --> 00:58:37,776
but I do know people.

1074
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:39,278
Miles is a...

1075
00:58:39,712 --> 00:58:42,348
Well, he's a beatnik.
He dresses like one.

1076
00:58:43,048 --> 00:58:44,483
Ford means reliability.

1077
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:46,986
Ken Miles is not a Ford man.

1078
00:58:47,086 --> 00:58:48,721
Whoa!

1079
00:58:48,821 --> 00:58:50,856
Giddy-up! Giddy-up!

1080
00:58:53,993 --> 00:58:56,128
What's the lap record
here, Burt?

1081
00:58:56,228 --> 00:58:58,130
1:58.

1082
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:00,466
- 1:50 dead.
- <i>A beatnik?</i>

1083
00:59:00,566 --> 00:59:03,302
That man landed a busted tank
on the beach at D-Day

1084
00:59:03,402 --> 00:59:05,804
and drove it clean
across Europe to Berlin.

1085
00:59:06,472 --> 00:59:07,873
A beatnik?

1086
00:59:07,973 --> 00:59:09,308
You know, Lee here asked me
a while back,

1087
00:59:09,408 --> 00:59:11,410
"What's the one thing
money can't buy?"

1088
00:59:12,144 --> 00:59:13,445
I'll tell you what it is.

1089
00:59:13,912 --> 00:59:16,115
A pure racer
behind the wheel of your car.

1090
00:59:16,915 --> 00:59:18,417
That's Ken Miles.

1091
00:59:19,985 --> 00:59:21,820
Well, be that as it may...

1092
00:59:22,655 --> 00:59:24,456
we think he may be too pure.

1093
00:59:32,331 --> 00:59:35,901
Carroll, do not lose sight
of the big picture here.

1094
00:59:37,202 --> 00:59:38,404
"Too pure"?

1095
00:59:39,138 --> 00:59:40,973
What exactly does that mean?

1096
00:59:41,607 --> 00:59:43,108
It means
he's all about himself.

1097
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:46,879
ABC puts a microphone
under his nose,

1098
00:59:46,979 --> 00:59:49,315
perhaps there's a detail
he dislikes,

1099
00:59:49,415 --> 00:59:50,549
millions watching...

1100
00:59:50,649 --> 00:59:52,786
do you trust him not to
put out the wrong message?

1101
00:59:52,885 --> 00:59:54,386
Well, look, you can get
a clean-cut,

1102
00:59:54,486 --> 00:59:55,587
all-American poster boy

1103
00:59:55,688 --> 00:59:56,722
and stick him
behind the wheel,

1104
00:59:56,822 --> 00:59:58,057
teach him what to say.

1105
00:59:58,157 --> 00:59:59,825
Shit, you get Doris Day
to drive the car,

1106
00:59:59,925 --> 01:00:01,160
if all you want to do is lose.

1107
01:00:01,795 --> 01:00:04,830
So, you don't agree with us
on this issue?

1108
01:00:06,899 --> 01:00:09,201
I'm saying you gotta trust me
on this one.

1109
01:00:09,868 --> 01:00:11,036
Carroll,
with marketing concerns,

1110
01:00:11,136 --> 01:00:12,571
that's just not possible.

1111
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:17,943
Put a Ford-type driver
in a Ford car, Mr. Shelby.

1112
01:00:18,644 --> 01:00:20,179
That's the Ford way.

1113
01:00:26,685 --> 01:00:28,921
<i>Yet another
championship win for Ferrari</i>

1114
01:00:29,021 --> 01:00:30,723
<i>as British driver John Surtees</i>

1115
01:00:30,824 --> 01:00:32,491
<i>pilots his Ferrari 312...</i>

1116
01:00:32,591 --> 01:00:34,193
Ferrari wins.

1117
01:00:34,293 --> 01:00:36,862
<i>It's Surtees'
first win since the '64...</i>

1118
01:00:36,962 --> 01:00:38,765
Wedges. We have wedges.

1119
01:00:38,864 --> 01:00:40,834
Oh, good, good, good.

1120
01:00:40,933 --> 01:00:42,267
Perfect.

1121
01:00:43,068 --> 01:00:45,070
- 40?
- Yep.

1122
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:55,481
- Hey, boss.
- Hey, Dan.

1123
01:00:55,581 --> 01:00:57,950
- Boss, Ferrari just bagged...
- You got a passport?

1124
01:00:58,050 --> 01:00:58,984
What's that?

1125
01:00:59,084 --> 01:01:00,854
Sign that. Get a passport.

1126
01:01:00,953 --> 01:01:02,721
Get it back to me
by Friday. Frosty.

1127
01:01:02,822 --> 01:01:04,089
Boys, I'm going to France.

1128
01:01:06,258 --> 01:01:07,559
Phil.

1129
01:01:07,659 --> 01:01:09,261
Ken, can I get a word?

1130
01:01:15,667 --> 01:01:16,935
Oh.

1131
01:01:18,036 --> 01:01:19,505
Can I take this?

1132
01:01:19,605 --> 01:01:20,706
Hey.

1133
01:01:21,073 --> 01:01:24,143
Do you know why Ford named it
the GT40?

1134
01:01:24,243 --> 01:01:26,145
Why they put that "40"
on there?

1135
01:01:26,245 --> 01:01:28,180
- No.
- Regulations. All right?

1136
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,850
We gotta be 40 inches high

1137
01:01:30,949 --> 01:01:33,685
to make the ground
clearance requirements.

1138
01:01:33,787 --> 01:01:34,854
No more, no less.

1139
01:01:34,953 --> 01:01:36,355
They measure it
before every race.

1140
01:01:36,455 --> 01:01:39,391
Problem is,
that with that height,

1141
01:01:39,491 --> 01:01:42,561
there's too much drag
under the car, all right?

1142
01:01:42,661 --> 01:01:44,263
So, we have a solution.

1143
01:01:44,363 --> 01:01:46,064
Wedges. We put wedges
in the suspension...

1144
01:01:46,165 --> 01:01:48,033
You're not coming next week.

1145
01:01:50,737 --> 01:01:52,137
You're not coming, Ken.

1146
01:01:55,307 --> 01:01:58,243
We're taking McLaren,
Chris Amon, Phil Hill...

1147
01:01:59,445 --> 01:02:00,712
and Bob Bondurant.

1148
01:02:01,513 --> 01:02:03,148
It's Ford's call.

1149
01:02:04,349 --> 01:02:06,853
It is their opinion that
you are not a good image,

1150
01:02:06,952 --> 01:02:09,254
so you cannot drive
their race car.

1151
01:02:10,556 --> 01:02:12,224
And putting aside the fact
that you made that car

1152
01:02:12,324 --> 01:02:13,692
whatever the hell it is...

1153
01:02:14,393 --> 01:02:17,396
and you're the best man
I got behind the wheel...

1154
01:02:37,149 --> 01:02:39,051
I'm gonna reroute
the oil line.

1155
01:02:39,151 --> 01:02:40,954
If there's spillage,
it could drip

1156
01:02:41,053 --> 01:02:42,789
onto the rear nearside disc.

1157
01:02:42,889 --> 01:02:43,989
Ken...

1158
01:02:44,089 --> 01:02:45,157
Tell the boys

1159
01:02:45,257 --> 01:02:49,328
to watch their pace
come sunrise.

1160
01:02:49,428 --> 01:02:53,131
The, uh,
the gearbox will overheat.

1161
01:03:10,984 --> 01:03:12,184
Ken, the race
is starting soon.

1162
01:03:12,284 --> 01:03:13,753
Want it on the radio?

1163
01:03:13,853 --> 01:03:15,387
Not unless you do.

1164
01:03:34,306 --> 01:03:35,742
<i>...of the race.</i>

1165
01:03:35,842 --> 01:03:36,675
<i>There they are.</i>

1166
01:03:36,776 --> 01:03:38,043
<i>The Maserati going
into the Esses,</i>

1167
01:03:38,143 --> 01:03:39,144
<i>but it's still
the number 2 car,</i>

1168
01:03:39,244 --> 01:03:40,345
<i>driven by Chris Amon.</i>

1169
01:03:40,445 --> 01:03:42,314
<i>In third place
is the number 1 Ford</i>

1170
01:03:42,414 --> 01:03:44,049
<i>that is driven
by Bruce McLaren.</i>

1171
01:03:44,149 --> 01:03:46,485
<i>A tremendously fast start
for the Ford GT.</i>

1172
01:03:46,585 --> 01:03:50,522
<i>3:43.4 lap
for car number 2, a Ford.</i>

1173
01:03:50,622 --> 01:03:52,224
<i>I think
it's a little bit quick</i>

1174
01:03:52,324 --> 01:03:53,458
<i>for this stage of the game.</i>

1175
01:03:53,559 --> 01:03:54,727
<i>Little bit quick right now.</i>

1176
01:03:54,827 --> 01:03:56,194
Racing too hot.

1177
01:03:57,462 --> 01:03:58,597
<i>This could go down</i>

1178
01:03:58,697 --> 01:04:00,165
<i>to the last hour or so,
don't you think?</i>

1179
01:04:00,265 --> 01:04:01,266
<i>It could,
but the probabilities</i>

1180
01:04:01,366 --> 01:04:02,434
<i>for a finish like that</i>

1181
01:04:02,534 --> 01:04:04,603
<i>in a 24-hour race
are awfully small.</i>

1182
01:04:04,703 --> 01:04:06,438
<i>Another Ford
has come into the pits.</i>

1183
01:04:06,538 --> 01:04:08,942
<i>It's being pushed into
the pits by the mechanics.</i>

1184
01:04:09,042 --> 01:04:10,509
Head gasket.

1185
01:04:11,176 --> 01:04:13,378
The car's not a moon rocket.

1186
01:04:13,478 --> 01:04:14,680
<i>Trailing
Bob Bondurant in fourth,</i>

1187
01:04:14,781 --> 01:04:15,815
<i>car number 7.</i>

1188
01:04:15,915 --> 01:04:18,985
<i>Leading number 20, Ferrari.
Michael Parkes.</i>

1189
01:04:19,084 --> 01:04:21,286
<i>So, we have Ford running one,
two, three. How about that?</i>

1190
01:04:21,386 --> 01:04:23,488
Too soon. Surely too soon.

1191
01:04:25,858 --> 01:04:27,860
<i>One has
to really be respectful</i>

1192
01:04:27,961 --> 01:04:29,261
<i>of the mechanism with any...</i>

1193
01:04:41,406 --> 01:04:42,708
<i>Here's the big story,</i>

1194
01:04:42,809 --> 01:04:45,344
<i>the lead Ford, driven
by Richie Ginther, retired</i>

1195
01:04:45,444 --> 01:04:47,479
<i>with gearbox trouble,
and the new leader...</i>

1196
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:51,350
Gearbox. I told them.
Be gentle with it.

1197
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:53,052
<i>...and his
partner Lorenzo Bandini...</i>

1198
01:04:53,151 --> 01:04:54,219
<i>...who was one of</i>

1199
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:56,321
<i>the winning drivers last year.</i>

1200
01:04:57,757 --> 01:04:59,324
Who's there?

1201
01:05:00,592 --> 01:05:01,828
<i>Again, we're back,</i>

1202
01:05:01,928 --> 01:05:04,463
<i>speaking to you live
from Le Mans, France.</i>

1203
01:05:04,563 --> 01:05:07,165
<i>The 24 Hours of Le Mans,
the Grand Prix of Endurance,</i>

1204
01:05:07,265 --> 01:05:08,868
<i>the 33rd renewal.</i>

1205
01:05:09,936 --> 01:05:11,603
What's that
you're listening to?

1206
01:05:12,204 --> 01:05:14,439
Oh, some race over in France.

1207
01:05:17,744 --> 01:05:18,811
Exciting?

1208
01:05:19,411 --> 01:05:21,513
I'm not really paying
much attention.

1209
01:05:21,613 --> 01:05:24,182
<i>However, Phil,
there was one time in 1933,</i>

1210
01:05:24,282 --> 01:05:27,219
<i>when the lead changed hands
three times.</i>

1211
01:05:39,297 --> 01:05:40,666
It's not exactly champagne...

1212
01:05:44,169 --> 01:05:46,139
...but it's got bubbles.

1213
01:06:15,134 --> 01:06:16,535
Thanks, Mollie.

1214
01:06:49,701 --> 01:06:52,471
There's a difference
between Ford and Ferrari...

1215
01:07:01,279 --> 01:07:02,414
Grace.

1216
01:07:10,455 --> 01:07:13,793
Yes, sir.
I will send him right in.

1217
01:07:14,794 --> 01:07:15,962
Thank you.

1218
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:20,800
Mr. Shelby,
Mr. Ford will see you now.

1219
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,136
- All right.
- Are you still willing

1220
01:07:23,236 --> 01:07:25,437
to stake your reputation
on this guy?

1221
01:07:27,272 --> 01:07:28,808
This way,
Mr. Shelby.

1222
01:07:38,918 --> 01:07:40,285
Mr. Ford.

1223
01:07:40,787 --> 01:07:41,954
Gentlemen.

1224
01:07:42,054 --> 01:07:43,522
Shelby.

1225
01:07:55,902 --> 01:07:59,005
Give me one reason
why I don't fire everyone

1226
01:07:59,105 --> 01:08:00,940
associated with
this abomination

1227
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,440
starting with you.

1228
01:08:08,981 --> 01:08:10,315
Well, sir...

1229
01:08:11,349 --> 01:08:12,852
I was thinking
about that very question

1230
01:08:12,952 --> 01:08:16,055
as I sat out there
in your lovely waiting room.

1231
01:08:17,957 --> 01:08:19,225
As I was sitting there...

1232
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:22,561
I watched that little
red folder right there...

1233
01:08:23,328 --> 01:08:25,097
go through four pairs
of hands...

1234
01:08:26,431 --> 01:08:27,834
before it got to you.

1235
01:08:28,533 --> 01:08:29,836
'Course that doesn't include...

1236
01:08:30,736 --> 01:08:32,839
the 22 or so
other Ford employees

1237
01:08:32,939 --> 01:08:34,439
who probably poked at it
before it made

1238
01:08:34,539 --> 01:08:36,441
its way up to the 19th floor.

1239
01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:39,678
All due respect, sir,

1240
01:08:40,579 --> 01:08:42,647
you can't win a race
by committee.

1241
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:45,852
You need one man in charge.

1242
01:08:46,551 --> 01:08:48,921
Now, the good news,
as I see it,

1243
01:08:49,288 --> 01:08:51,057
is that even with
all the extra weight...

1244
01:08:53,326 --> 01:08:55,328
we still managed
to put old Mr. Ferrari

1245
01:08:55,427 --> 01:08:56,863
exactly where we want him.

1246
01:08:58,164 --> 01:08:59,464
Did we?

1247
01:08:59,899 --> 01:09:01,000
Oh, yes.

1248
01:09:02,869 --> 01:09:04,103
Expand.

1249
01:09:05,403 --> 01:09:06,671
Well...

1250
01:09:08,274 --> 01:09:09,641
sure, we hadn't...

1251
01:09:10,408 --> 01:09:12,677
We haven't worked out
how to corner yet.

1252
01:09:13,511 --> 01:09:14,713
Or stay cool.

1253
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,850
Or stay on the ground.

1254
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:19,952
And a lot of stuff broke.

1255
01:09:20,685 --> 01:09:23,388
In fact, the only thing that
didn't break was the brakes.

1256
01:09:23,956 --> 01:09:25,791
Hell, right now,
we don't even know

1257
01:09:25,892 --> 01:09:28,761
if our paint job will last
the whole 24 hours.

1258
01:09:34,633 --> 01:09:36,068
But our last lap...

1259
01:09:36,601 --> 01:09:40,339
we clocked 218 miles an hour
down the Mulsanne Straight.

1260
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:44,277
Now, in all his years
of racing...

1261
01:09:45,011 --> 01:09:48,713
old Enzo ain't never seen
anything move that fast.

1262
01:09:49,949 --> 01:09:51,083
And now he knows...

1263
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:53,052
without a doubt...

1264
01:09:54,653 --> 01:09:56,688
we're faster than he is...

1265
01:09:59,859 --> 01:10:01,894
even with the wrong driver...

1266
01:10:03,062 --> 01:10:04,562
and all the committees.

1267
01:10:06,299 --> 01:10:07,699
And that's what
he's thinking about

1268
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,202
while he's sitting
in Modena, Italy...

1269
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:12,738
right now.

1270
01:10:14,173 --> 01:10:15,875
That man is scared to death...

1271
01:10:17,009 --> 01:10:19,912
that this year you actually
might be smart enough

1272
01:10:20,012 --> 01:10:21,479
to start trusting me.

1273
01:10:24,449 --> 01:10:25,851
So, yeah...

1274
01:10:27,619 --> 01:10:30,522
I'd say you got Ferrari
exactly where you want him.

1275
01:10:34,226 --> 01:10:35,560
You're welcome.

1276
01:10:53,245 --> 01:10:54,713
Come here.

1277
01:11:02,288 --> 01:11:04,090
See that little building
down there?

1278
01:11:04,723 --> 01:11:06,092
In World War II...

1279
01:11:06,591 --> 01:11:10,730
three out of five US bombers
rolled off that line.

1280
01:11:12,898 --> 01:11:15,001
You think
Roosevelt beat Hitler?

1281
01:11:16,634 --> 01:11:17,569
Think again.

1282
01:11:17,669 --> 01:11:18,771
This isn't the first time

1283
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:21,107
Ford Motor's gone
to war in Europe.

1284
01:11:23,541 --> 01:11:26,078
We know how to do more
than push paper.

1285
01:11:28,546 --> 01:11:31,017
And there is one man
running this company.

1286
01:11:33,452 --> 01:11:34,887
You report to him.

1287
01:11:36,288 --> 01:11:37,722
You understand me?

1288
01:11:38,224 --> 01:11:39,624
Yes, sir.

1289
01:11:40,525 --> 01:11:43,062
Go ahead, Carroll.
Go to war.

1290
01:11:46,132 --> 01:11:47,199
Thank you, sir.

1291
01:12:20,132 --> 01:12:21,167
You were right.

1292
01:12:21,734 --> 01:12:23,102
It's the gearbox.

1293
01:12:23,769 --> 01:12:25,104
We ran too hot.

1294
01:12:26,372 --> 01:12:27,740
Three out of four
of 'em broke.

1295
01:12:28,541 --> 01:12:30,042
The rod blew on the other one.

1296
01:12:35,181 --> 01:12:36,849
We're going back, Ken.

1297
01:12:40,386 --> 01:12:43,923
They told me I had
"carte blanche" this time.

1298
01:12:45,324 --> 01:12:47,760
I looked it up.
It's French for "horseshit."

1299
01:12:48,227 --> 01:12:50,563
I know they're gonna squeeze
our nuts any way they can

1300
01:12:50,662 --> 01:12:52,064
soon as they work out how.

1301
01:12:52,597 --> 01:12:54,033
Well, the, uh...

1302
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,268
ice cream's melting.

1303
01:12:59,305 --> 01:13:00,873
All right. Hey, Ken.

1304
01:13:02,408 --> 01:13:04,009
You want me to apologize?

1305
01:13:05,511 --> 01:13:06,779
Mmm.

1306
01:13:07,179 --> 01:13:08,214
You want me to beg?

1307
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,416
I don't know.
Let's try it out.

1308
01:13:10,516 --> 01:13:12,885
Let's, uh, see how that feels.

1309
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:20,259
Ken, I'm sorry.

1310
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:22,995
Sincerely.

1311
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:25,865
Mmm.

1312
01:13:26,866 --> 01:13:29,401
Do you have any idea the kind
of shit that I had to eat

1313
01:13:29,502 --> 01:13:31,070
just to get four wheels
on that grid?

1314
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:32,171
No, you don't.

1315
01:13:32,271 --> 01:13:33,939
'Cause you don't deal
with any of that stuff.

1316
01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:35,908
Now knock it off, Ken.
We got work to do,

1317
01:13:36,008 --> 01:13:37,443
and this car ain't gonna
build itself.

1318
01:13:46,684 --> 01:13:49,721
Okay. All right.

1319
01:13:58,464 --> 01:14:01,000
God.

1320
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:02,768
Come here.

1321
01:14:03,736 --> 01:14:06,005
- Bloody car salesman.
- Shit!

1322
01:14:08,941 --> 01:14:10,708
Come on.
Now you're gonna get it.

1323
01:14:15,347 --> 01:14:16,448
Get off me!

1324
01:14:18,918 --> 01:14:22,421
Stubborn son of a bitch.

1325
01:14:22,521 --> 01:14:23,923
God!

1326
01:14:26,091 --> 01:14:27,726
- You just look...
- Right.

1327
01:14:28,561 --> 01:14:29,862
- Yeah, now.
- You...

1328
01:14:29,962 --> 01:14:31,530
- Ow!
- You all right?

1329
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:33,065
Shit!

1330
01:14:34,533 --> 01:14:36,101
Now you're gonna get it.

1331
01:14:37,702 --> 01:14:39,538
Come here.

1332
01:14:42,174 --> 01:14:43,209
Done.

1333
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:49,481
Mollie, darling.

1334
01:14:50,282 --> 01:14:51,350
Yes, love?

1335
01:14:51,716 --> 01:14:53,285
Can I get a fizzy pop, please?

1336
01:14:54,587 --> 01:14:55,854
Yes, love.

1337
01:14:57,489 --> 01:14:58,791
You want one, too, Shelby?

1338
01:14:59,158 --> 01:15:01,260
- No. No.
- Uh, yes, please, Mollie.

1339
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,229
No. He can get his own.

1340
01:15:03,596 --> 01:15:05,030
Just for me, please.

1341
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:13,138
How long has that been?

1342
01:15:14,073 --> 01:15:16,141
Oh, it's gotta be three
or four years, at least.

1343
01:15:16,242 --> 01:15:18,210
Right. Riverside.

1344
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:21,280
Yeah.
SCCA Divisional Championship.

1345
01:15:21,747 --> 01:15:23,115
You broke my finger.

1346
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:28,854
What's that nippy bloody thing

1347
01:15:29,188 --> 01:15:30,723
you do under the arm,
that thing?

1348
01:15:30,823 --> 01:15:32,524
Yeah. I call that
the Llama Bite.

1349
01:15:32,625 --> 01:15:35,094
You name it?

1350
01:15:35,194 --> 01:15:37,463
Where'd you learn that?
The Girl Scouts?

1351
01:15:37,563 --> 01:15:40,065
- What? You wanna go again?
- Here you go.

1352
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:42,401
You're an angel.

1353
01:15:42,501 --> 01:15:43,535
Thank you.

1354
01:15:43,636 --> 01:15:44,770
My pleasure.

1355
01:15:45,571 --> 01:15:48,107
Right. Well, I'm about to go
to the grocery store.

1356
01:15:48,207 --> 01:15:50,075
Anything you think
you'll need?

1357
01:15:50,643 --> 01:15:52,811
Um, ice cream.

1358
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:55,481
Ice cream would be good
and, uh...

1359
01:15:56,348 --> 01:15:57,416
bread.

1360
01:15:58,617 --> 01:15:59,718
Right.

1361
01:15:59,852 --> 01:16:01,453
No, I'm good.
Thank you.

1362
01:16:02,154 --> 01:16:04,223
Thanks, Moll.

1363
01:16:04,323 --> 01:16:05,958
You still take those
for your ticker?

1364
01:16:06,392 --> 01:16:08,560
Only 'cause
they're so delicious.

1365
01:16:08,661 --> 01:16:11,797
- Up yours.
- Oh, go to hell.

1366
01:16:19,438 --> 01:16:21,607
Come on.
Giddy-up. Giddy-up. Giddy-up.

1367
01:16:37,423 --> 01:16:40,225
Phil! Here's the one
for you, mate.

1368
01:16:40,326 --> 01:16:41,593
Dino, come here.

1369
01:16:59,878 --> 01:17:01,046
Well?

1370
01:17:01,146 --> 01:17:02,715
There's still lag
when I hit the gas.

1371
01:17:02,816 --> 01:17:04,183
Let's get rid of
the vacuum secondaries.

1372
01:17:04,283 --> 01:17:05,752
Charlie, get a Holley carb.

1373
01:17:05,851 --> 01:17:07,653
We're gonna rebuild
the throttle assembly.

1374
01:17:07,754 --> 01:17:09,088
Three weeks to Daytona,

1375
01:17:09,188 --> 01:17:12,057
and it still feels
like a bag of squirrels.

1376
01:17:12,157 --> 01:17:13,425
Brake heat.

1377
01:17:13,859 --> 01:17:15,494
That's a whole different
ball game.

1378
01:17:15,594 --> 01:17:18,197
All right, Petey,
let's go for that ride.

1379
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,173
What are you doing?

1380
01:17:29,708 --> 01:17:31,043
You see that crack?

1381
01:17:31,143 --> 01:17:33,011
That's my marker
for turn eight.

1382
01:17:35,881 --> 01:17:37,349
What, to slow down?

1383
01:17:38,183 --> 01:17:41,387
Uh, brush the brakes
and downshift.

1384
01:17:43,288 --> 01:17:45,924
But you'll be going
150 miles an hour.

1385
01:17:46,658 --> 01:17:47,794
Yeah.

1386
01:17:47,893 --> 01:17:49,428
So how do you see it?

1387
01:17:49,528 --> 01:17:52,564
You're going fast,
but as the car speeds up...

1388
01:17:53,098 --> 01:17:55,467
everything else slows down.

1389
01:17:55,567 --> 01:17:57,236
You don't do that.

1390
01:17:58,036 --> 01:17:59,938
You do this. Right?

1391
01:18:00,038 --> 01:18:02,040
And then you see everything.

1392
01:18:04,676 --> 01:18:06,478
Do you set other markers?

1393
01:18:06,578 --> 01:18:08,914
Indeed I do.

1394
01:18:10,416 --> 01:18:11,583
Lots of them.

1395
01:18:13,452 --> 01:18:15,789
Yeah, 'cause
you can't just push

1396
01:18:15,889 --> 01:18:17,857
the car hard
the whole way, right?

1397
01:18:17,956 --> 01:18:20,492
That's right. You have
to be kind to the car.

1398
01:18:20,592 --> 01:18:24,963
You feel the poor thing
groaning underneath you.

1399
01:18:25,732 --> 01:18:29,803
If you're gonna push a piece
of machinery to the limit

1400
01:18:29,903 --> 01:18:31,470
and expect it
to hold together,

1401
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:36,141
you have to have some sense
of where that limit is.

1402
01:18:38,845 --> 01:18:40,078
Look out there.

1403
01:18:40,979 --> 01:18:44,149
Out there is the perfect lap.

1404
01:18:46,385 --> 01:18:47,553
No mistakes.

1405
01:18:48,187 --> 01:18:50,556
Every gear change,
every corner...

1406
01:18:52,324 --> 01:18:53,392
perfect.

1407
01:18:54,894 --> 01:18:56,261
You see it?

1408
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:01,567
I think so.

1409
01:19:03,569 --> 01:19:05,137
Most people can't.

1410
01:19:06,271 --> 01:19:09,241
Most people don't even know
it's out there, but it is.

1411
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:12,678
It's there.

1412
01:19:15,714 --> 01:19:17,182
You want some ice cream?

1413
01:19:19,718 --> 01:19:21,153
- Yeah.
- All right.

1414
01:19:21,987 --> 01:19:23,255
Come on, then.

1415
01:19:23,790 --> 01:19:25,157
Do you know
what this marker is?

1416
01:19:25,257 --> 01:19:26,291
- What?
- That one.

1417
01:19:26,391 --> 01:19:27,861
Pull my finger.
You'll find out.

1418
01:19:50,048 --> 01:19:52,084
How much longer
before he comes in?

1419
01:19:52,184 --> 01:19:54,553
Uh, well, we change drivers
every four hours,

1420
01:19:54,653 --> 01:19:56,355
- so about 10 minutes.
- <i>No, hang on.</i>

1421
01:19:56,455 --> 01:19:59,057
You're saying Beebe
is 100 percent in charge now?

1422
01:19:59,157 --> 01:20:01,293
<i>Yes,
and he wants Miles gone.</i>

1423
01:20:01,895 --> 01:20:03,595
Look, it's personal
with this guy.

1424
01:20:03,695 --> 01:20:05,664
And, yes, he has the leverage
to stick it to you.

1425
01:20:05,765 --> 01:20:07,666
<i>He and the Deuce
are flying there tomorrow.</i>

1426
01:20:07,767 --> 01:20:08,801
He's gonna tell you in person.

1427
01:20:08,902 --> 01:20:10,068
Now, all he is hoping for

1428
01:20:10,168 --> 01:20:11,771
- is that you lose your cool.
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

1429
01:20:11,871 --> 01:20:13,338
<i>It's time to let this go.</i>

1430
01:20:13,438 --> 01:20:14,841
You cannot destroy
the whole thing.

1431
01:20:14,941 --> 01:20:15,975
Not for one goddamn guy.

1432
01:20:16,074 --> 01:20:18,011
- Sure, I can.
- <i>Well, why?</i>

1433
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:19,244
'Cause while
we're here talking,

1434
01:20:19,344 --> 01:20:20,679
he's out there
getting it done.

1435
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:30,222
Oh, shit!

1436
01:20:31,858 --> 01:20:33,458
He's got brake fade.

1437
01:20:40,833 --> 01:20:42,067
Ease off!

1438
01:20:52,177 --> 01:20:53,178
<i>Carroll?</i>

1439
01:20:53,445 --> 01:20:54,680
- Get him out!
- Peter!

1440
01:20:54,781 --> 01:20:56,582
Go on. Go inside.

1441
01:20:56,682 --> 01:20:57,482
Just stay there.

1442
01:20:57,583 --> 01:20:59,052
- Get Ken!
- Ken!

1443
01:20:59,151 --> 01:21:00,552
Get him out!

1444
01:21:02,254 --> 01:21:03,422
There he is!

1445
01:21:03,522 --> 01:21:04,256
Ken!

1446
01:21:04,356 --> 01:21:05,724
I can see him.

1447
01:21:12,097 --> 01:21:13,498
- Ken!
- Come on.

1448
01:21:20,105 --> 01:21:21,406
The brakes.

1449
01:21:30,716 --> 01:21:33,619
Let's just rip out
the damn engine. All right?

1450
01:21:33,719 --> 01:21:36,421
We can't use it
if we can't stop.

1451
01:21:36,521 --> 01:21:37,857
You know,
the brakes would last longer

1452
01:21:37,957 --> 01:21:39,591
if we slowed down a bit.

1453
01:21:39,859 --> 01:21:42,527
Wouldn't that defeat the whole
purpose of the extra power?

1454
01:21:43,195 --> 01:21:44,296
You know,
I thought the whole point

1455
01:21:44,396 --> 01:21:45,765
was to win the damned race.

1456
01:21:46,498 --> 01:21:48,533
Maybe we could design
a new assembly.

1457
01:21:48,634 --> 01:21:52,337
Instead of swapping out
the pads in the pits...

1458
01:21:52,739 --> 01:21:55,574
swap out
the entire braking system.

1459
01:21:55,674 --> 01:21:57,209
Rotors included.

1460
01:21:57,777 --> 01:21:58,911
Put in a fresh one.

1461
01:21:59,012 --> 01:22:00,780
Wait, wait, wait, Pops,

1462
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:01,981
are we allowed to do that?

1463
01:22:02,081 --> 01:22:05,283
I don't know.
I don't read French.

1464
01:22:06,819 --> 01:22:11,758
Well, brakes are "a part"
like any other, right?

1465
01:22:11,858 --> 01:22:14,192
We are allowed
to change parts.

1466
01:22:14,292 --> 01:22:16,161
Yes.
Will we have time to do that?

1467
01:22:16,261 --> 01:22:17,864
I don't know yet,
Charlie.

1468
01:22:18,463 --> 01:22:20,066
I'm gonna take him home.

1469
01:22:20,165 --> 01:22:21,266
All right.

1470
01:22:21,366 --> 01:22:22,601
Sort this shit out.

1471
01:22:22,701 --> 01:22:23,770
I will.

1472
01:22:33,211 --> 01:22:35,614
Have you ever been on fire?

1473
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:41,520
Uh, well, no,
it's never happened to me.

1474
01:22:46,391 --> 01:22:48,861
But the suit's
flameproof, see?

1475
01:22:48,961 --> 01:22:50,529
It, uh, keeps heat out.

1476
01:22:51,496 --> 01:22:52,531
Yeah.

1477
01:22:54,133 --> 01:22:56,501
But Lewis-Evans
burned to death

1478
01:22:56,601 --> 01:22:57,837
in the Moroccan Grand Prix.

1479
01:22:57,937 --> 01:22:59,939
He had a flameproof suit on.

1480
01:23:01,174 --> 01:23:04,209
Mm-hmm. Yeah, but, um...

1481
01:23:07,013 --> 01:23:08,313
See, he got stuck.

1482
01:23:08,413 --> 01:23:09,882
He couldn't breathe.

1483
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:14,553
So, as long as you get out
of the car, you're okay.

1484
01:23:18,724 --> 01:23:20,325
Dad got out.

1485
01:23:21,426 --> 01:23:23,261
- He sure did.
- Peter!

1486
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:28,400
Bye.

1487
01:23:29,234 --> 01:23:30,569
See ya.

1488
01:23:33,172 --> 01:23:34,774
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1489
01:23:35,975 --> 01:23:37,309
What's wrong with you?

1490
01:23:38,177 --> 01:23:39,411
And don't be telling me brakes

1491
01:23:39,511 --> 01:23:41,748
or me almost kicking
the bucket out there.

1492
01:23:41,848 --> 01:23:44,382
It's something to do
with the suits, isn't it?

1493
01:23:46,786 --> 01:23:48,154
It's under control.

1494
01:23:48,253 --> 01:23:49,588
What is it?

1495
01:23:49,688 --> 01:23:51,224
You know how we talked about
how you do your thing,

1496
01:23:51,323 --> 01:23:52,390
I do my thing?

1497
01:23:52,491 --> 01:23:53,893
- This is my thing.
- Really, Shel...

1498
01:23:53,993 --> 01:23:55,460
Just trust me, Ken.

1499
01:23:56,129 --> 01:23:57,496
You got a plan?

1500
01:23:58,197 --> 01:23:59,498
Absolutely.

1501
01:23:59,999 --> 01:24:01,033
It a good one?

1502
01:24:02,001 --> 01:24:03,268
It's high risk.

1503
01:24:03,368 --> 01:24:04,402
How high risk?

1504
01:24:04,503 --> 01:24:06,005
Extremely high risk.

1505
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:09,374
Well, that's something.

1506
01:24:10,109 --> 01:24:12,011
- Glad we had this talk.
- Anytime.

1507
01:24:24,257 --> 01:24:26,726
Mr. Ford, this is a surprise.

1508
01:24:27,526 --> 01:24:29,796
Apologies for the unannounced
intrusion, Mr. Shelby,

1509
01:24:29,896 --> 01:24:33,298
but when a man pays $9 million
for an automobile,

1510
01:24:33,398 --> 01:24:35,234
he ought to at least
be able to see it.

1511
01:24:35,333 --> 01:24:36,903
Well, that sounds
reasonable enough.

1512
01:24:37,003 --> 01:24:38,838
Uh, Shelby, could I have a word?

1513
01:24:38,938 --> 01:24:40,106
Sure.

1514
01:24:40,206 --> 01:24:42,008
- In private?
- Uh, yeah.

1515
01:24:42,108 --> 01:24:43,508
That would be preferable.

1516
01:24:43,608 --> 01:24:44,744
All right.
Hey, Phil.

1517
01:24:44,844 --> 01:24:46,478
You wanna take care
of Mr. Ford here?

1518
01:24:46,578 --> 01:24:48,247
Mr. Ford,
that's Phil Remington.

1519
01:24:48,346 --> 01:24:49,414
Of course.

1520
01:24:49,514 --> 01:24:50,582
Come up
to my office, Leo.

1521
01:24:50,682 --> 01:24:51,751
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Phil.

1522
01:24:51,851 --> 01:24:53,953
Give you a little tour
of your car.

1523
01:24:54,787 --> 01:24:57,857
We, uh, took out
your 289 small block...

1524
01:24:58,423 --> 01:25:00,893
and put in a 427 7-liter.

1525
01:25:03,528 --> 01:25:05,832
Uh, firstly,
I want to just clear the air.

1526
01:25:05,932 --> 01:25:08,301
I hope
that whatever disagreements

1527
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,303
between us
can just be chalked up...

1528
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:13,538
to natural red-bloodedness
in the heat of battle.

1529
01:25:13,638 --> 01:25:16,575
Oh, I appreciate that, Leo.
Truly, I do.

1530
01:25:17,944 --> 01:25:20,947
It falls on me, Shelby,
to inform you

1531
01:25:21,047 --> 01:25:22,547
that I have been appointed

1532
01:25:22,647 --> 01:25:25,684
overall executive director
of the racing program.

1533
01:25:26,919 --> 01:25:30,756
Now, I do hope that this
won't be a problem between us.

1534
01:25:31,556 --> 01:25:33,826
Well, I assure you, Leo,
it will not.

1535
01:25:44,103 --> 01:25:45,403
Hey, Carroll...

1536
01:25:45,872 --> 01:25:46,638
Carroll!

1537
01:25:46,739 --> 01:25:48,074
And what is that top speed

1538
01:25:48,174 --> 01:25:49,308
with the, uh, 427?

1539
01:25:49,407 --> 01:25:51,177
Well, why don't we take it
for a spin?

1540
01:25:51,277 --> 01:25:52,644
- What?
- Yeah, go on, Mr. Ford.

1541
01:25:52,745 --> 01:25:55,014
- Hop on in. Go on.
- You want me to...

1542
01:25:55,114 --> 01:25:57,316
Just see
what $9 million feels like.

1543
01:25:57,415 --> 01:25:59,852
Hey!

1544
01:25:59,952 --> 01:26:01,153
God...

1545
01:26:04,857 --> 01:26:05,892
Open the door!

1546
01:26:05,992 --> 01:26:07,659
Hey, open the door!

1547
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:09,962
Open the door!

1548
01:26:12,164 --> 01:26:13,431
Just hold me right there,

1549
01:26:13,531 --> 01:26:15,034
and you take my hand.

1550
01:26:16,668 --> 01:26:19,338
Oh, God. I sat on my nuts.

1551
01:26:19,437 --> 01:26:21,673
We're gonna build the next one
for comfort. Don't you worry.

1552
01:26:30,383 --> 01:26:31,716
Open the door.

1553
01:26:31,817 --> 01:26:33,252
Sorry, sir,
if you just give me a moment.

1554
01:26:33,352 --> 01:26:34,387
- Open the door.
- It's a sticky one.

1555
01:26:34,519 --> 01:26:36,055
You ready?

1556
01:26:36,155 --> 01:26:37,823
The name on the middle
of that steering wheel

1557
01:26:37,924 --> 01:26:40,359
should tell you that I was
born ready, Shelby. Hit it.

1558
01:26:40,458 --> 01:26:42,527
Attaboy.

1559
01:26:44,663 --> 01:26:47,532
Whoa! It's got a little kick,
doesn't it?

1560
01:26:47,833 --> 01:26:49,735
- Open this door.
- Oh, there we go.

1561
01:26:49,835 --> 01:26:52,104
Good God, Mr. Beebe.
You okay, sir?

1562
01:26:53,940 --> 01:26:56,541
Whoa! Oh, my God!

1563
01:26:57,509 --> 01:27:00,212
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1564
01:27:04,016 --> 01:27:05,384
Yeah, baby.

1565
01:27:05,483 --> 01:27:08,154
Yeah, baby.

1566
01:27:11,057 --> 01:27:13,225
It's about right now
the uninitiated

1567
01:27:13,326 --> 01:27:15,527
have a tendency
to soil themselves.

1568
01:27:22,534 --> 01:27:25,271
Oh, my God! Whoa!

1569
01:28:01,907 --> 01:28:03,042
Mr. Ford...

1570
01:28:06,979 --> 01:28:08,314
You okay?

1571
01:28:11,649 --> 01:28:12,918
Mr. Ford...

1572
01:28:13,486 --> 01:28:14,586
you all right?

1573
01:28:14,686 --> 01:28:16,088
I had no idea.

1574
01:28:18,590 --> 01:28:20,092
I had no idea.

1575
01:28:23,062 --> 01:28:24,397
I wish my daddy...

1576
01:28:24,764 --> 01:28:26,465
he were alive to see this.

1577
01:28:26,732 --> 01:28:29,601
To feel this.

1578
01:28:31,103 --> 01:28:33,205
Now, this is not a machine
just anybody can get in

1579
01:28:33,305 --> 01:28:34,440
and easily control.

1580
01:28:34,539 --> 01:28:35,975
Absolutely not.

1581
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:37,642
I had no idea.

1582
01:28:37,743 --> 01:28:39,178
Now, you wanna win Le Mans.

1583
01:28:39,912 --> 01:28:41,414
If you really wanna take
first place,

1584
01:28:41,514 --> 01:28:43,082
Ken Miles is the man to do it.

1585
01:28:52,258 --> 01:28:53,492
Good timing.

1586
01:28:53,591 --> 01:28:54,626
<i>Now, he knows this car</i>

1587
01:28:54,727 --> 01:28:56,328
because he helped me build it.

1588
01:28:57,730 --> 01:29:00,099
Shelby, you know I've already

1589
01:29:00,199 --> 01:29:01,967
appointed Leo Beebe
director of racing.

1590
01:29:02,068 --> 01:29:04,170
Which is exactly
why I'm talking to you.

1591
01:29:05,071 --> 01:29:07,973
Now, you let Ken Miles
race Daytona.

1592
01:29:08,573 --> 01:29:10,042
If he wins...

1593
01:29:10,843 --> 01:29:12,745
he gets to drive Le Mans.

1594
01:29:15,247 --> 01:29:16,449
And if he doesn't?

1595
01:29:17,216 --> 01:29:19,552
Ford Motor Company
gets full ownership

1596
01:29:19,651 --> 01:29:21,053
of Shelby American.

1597
01:29:21,153 --> 01:29:22,488
Lock, stock, and brand.

1598
01:29:22,587 --> 01:29:23,856
Forever.

1599
01:29:26,926 --> 01:29:29,694
<i>We're in
hour six at the Daytona 24,</i>

1600
01:29:29,795 --> 01:29:32,965
<i>and Fords are dominating
the leaderboard.</i>

1601
01:29:33,065 --> 01:29:36,102
<i>Shelby American's Ken Miles
holds a narrow lead</i>

1602
01:29:36,202 --> 01:29:39,271
<i>over the Holman-Moody Ford
driven by Walt Hansgen.</i>

1603
01:29:40,339 --> 01:29:42,707
I don't bloody think so, Walt.

1604
01:30:00,993 --> 01:30:04,196
Oh, this race is not just
a test of our cars,

1605
01:30:04,296 --> 01:30:05,630
but also our teams.

1606
01:30:05,731 --> 01:30:07,665
As you know, we have
a second team out there today.

1607
01:30:07,766 --> 01:30:09,935
- Holman-Moody.
- That's right.

1608
01:30:10,035 --> 01:30:11,604
<i>Number 95, Hansgen,</i>

1609
01:30:11,703 --> 01:30:12,972
<i>blisters through
the front tri-oval</i>

1610
01:30:13,072 --> 01:30:15,241
<i>while closing in on Ken Miles.</i>

1611
01:30:15,341 --> 01:30:16,641
Walt's pushing her too fast.

1612
01:30:16,742 --> 01:30:18,944
He's pushing 7,000 RPM.

1613
01:30:19,044 --> 01:30:20,546
Hey, get the EZ sign
out there.

1614
01:30:20,645 --> 01:30:22,214
Come on. Move. Do it now.

1615
01:30:22,314 --> 01:30:24,383
Every one of these GTs
out there today

1616
01:30:24,483 --> 01:30:26,085
is under
my direct supervision.

1617
01:30:26,185 --> 01:30:29,188
And of course the supervision
of Henry Ford II.

1618
01:30:29,288 --> 01:30:32,358
The drivers,
the speed, the strategy...

1619
01:30:32,791 --> 01:30:35,628
even the RPMs
are determined by us.

1620
01:30:39,331 --> 01:30:40,966
<i>Ken Miles
is locked in a pitched battle</i>

1621
01:30:41,066 --> 01:30:44,203
<i>with Hansgen
as they pass the grandstand.</i>

1622
01:30:47,206 --> 01:30:50,242
<i>Hansgen is taking a run
at Miles entering turn one.</i>

1623
01:30:50,342 --> 01:30:51,544
<i>Miles is boxed in.</i>

1624
01:30:51,644 --> 01:30:53,946
<i>Hansgen slips by
and takes the lead</i>

1625
01:30:54,046 --> 01:30:56,081
<i>approaching
the infield chicane.</i>

1626
01:31:05,791 --> 01:31:06,859
Cor blimey!

1627
01:31:06,959 --> 01:31:08,527
Did you see that?

1628
01:31:08,627 --> 01:31:09,995
<i>The caution flag is out.</i>

1629
01:31:16,302 --> 01:31:18,904
Still racing.
Hey, we are still racing.

1630
01:31:19,004 --> 01:31:20,172
Come on, guys, let's go!

1631
01:31:20,272 --> 01:31:21,240
Let's go. Move it.

1632
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:22,341
He's coming in.

1633
01:31:23,142 --> 01:31:25,411
Let's go,
let's go, guys. Come on.

1634
01:31:25,511 --> 01:31:26,879
Go, tires up.

1635
01:31:26,979 --> 01:31:28,547
Here, right here.
Let's go. Let's go. Move it.

1636
01:31:28,647 --> 01:31:30,316
- Fuel flying in.
- Breaker bar!

1637
01:31:30,416 --> 01:31:32,218
- We're good.
- It all checked out.

1638
01:31:32,318 --> 01:31:33,852
- 36. 38.
- Go! Go!

1639
01:31:33,953 --> 01:31:36,255
Hansgen is right up our arse.

1640
01:31:36,355 --> 01:31:38,057
If I can just get
outta the pit ahead of him...

1641
01:31:38,157 --> 01:31:40,826
She's running hot,
but I think she'll hold.

1642
01:31:40,926 --> 01:31:42,461
- Fuel's low.
- Bring up the scoop.

1643
01:31:42,561 --> 01:31:43,862
She's hot.

1644
01:31:45,965 --> 01:31:47,833
Hey there, Walt.
Good to see you.

1645
01:31:47,933 --> 01:31:49,635
Yeah, after I get out
of this pit, Shelby,

1646
01:31:49,735 --> 01:31:50,836
it's the last time you will.

1647
01:31:50,936 --> 01:31:51,904
Oh, don't worry.

1648
01:31:52,004 --> 01:31:53,339
We got rearview mirrors.

1649
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:56,508
What happened
to that Mustang he took out?

1650
01:31:57,276 --> 01:31:58,611
Don't know yet.

1651
01:31:58,711 --> 01:32:01,513
I can push her harder
than six, Shel.

1652
01:32:01,614 --> 01:32:04,016
- I can feel it.
- Uh-huh.

1653
01:32:07,386 --> 01:32:11,257
Hey, how come these guys pit
so much faster than we do?

1654
01:32:11,357 --> 01:32:14,960
They got a goddamn
NASCAR crew, that's why.

1655
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:17,029
- No shit?
- No shit.

1656
01:32:17,496 --> 01:32:19,298
Go! Go, come on.

1657
01:32:20,633 --> 01:32:22,368
We're clear, we're clear.

1658
01:32:22,468 --> 01:32:23,569
Goddamn NASCAR crew.

1659
01:32:23,669 --> 01:32:25,337
Go, go, go!

1660
01:32:25,739 --> 01:32:27,373
Guys, they've already left.

1661
01:32:30,242 --> 01:32:31,110
Hello?

1662
01:32:31,210 --> 01:32:33,345
<i>There's my Mollie. Hello.</i>

1663
01:32:33,879 --> 01:32:34,947
Hiya, love.

1664
01:32:35,047 --> 01:32:36,882
- Mom? Mom?
- <i>What are you doing?</i>

1665
01:32:36,982 --> 01:32:37,983
Just having a cuppa.

1666
01:32:38,083 --> 01:32:39,753
Mom, ask him about the brakes.

1667
01:32:39,852 --> 01:32:42,254
- Go to bed. It's 1:00 a.m.
- Ask him.

1668
01:32:42,354 --> 01:32:43,689
Go to bed. Now.

1669
01:32:43,789 --> 01:32:45,591
I take it he's not asleep.

1670
01:32:45,691 --> 01:32:47,459
I'm sure he smuggled
in a radio.

1671
01:32:47,559 --> 01:32:48,827
<i>Yeah.</i>

1672
01:32:48,927 --> 01:32:50,129
He said to ask,
"How are the brakes?"

1673
01:32:50,229 --> 01:32:52,064
The brakes? Yes. No, no, no.

1674
01:32:52,164 --> 01:32:54,199
Tell him
they're working for now.

1675
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:57,002
<i>You know, Shelby's been acting
very strange.</i>

1676
01:32:57,102 --> 01:32:58,170
- <i>Ford have gone...</i>
- Ken.

1677
01:32:58,270 --> 01:32:59,605
<i>...and put up another team.</i>

1678
01:32:59,705 --> 01:33:00,973
- With a GT.
- <i>Ken.</i>

1679
01:33:01,073 --> 01:33:02,274
Some sort of yampy,

1680
01:33:02,374 --> 01:33:04,310
<i>bloody corporate test
or something.</i>

1681
01:33:04,410 --> 01:33:06,412
Just take a rest
whenever you get a chance.

1682
01:33:06,512 --> 01:33:07,946
<i>Sorry, my love,
what were you saying?</i>

1683
01:33:08,047 --> 01:33:09,548
You've only got a few hours.

1684
01:33:09,648 --> 01:33:10,750
<i>I can't hear you very well.</i>

1685
01:33:10,849 --> 01:33:12,217
<i>I'm sorry. I can't hear you.</i>

1686
01:33:12,318 --> 01:33:13,252
<i>Wish me luck.</i>

1687
01:33:13,352 --> 01:33:15,554
- Good luck.
- <i>I love you, darling.</i>

1688
01:33:15,654 --> 01:33:17,990
<i>After 23 hours

1694
01:33:28,667 --> 01:33:30,035

1695
01:33:30,135 --> 01:33:31,603
this late in the race.

1696
01:33:32,137 --> 01:33:34,673
Engine's hot. We gotta keep it
under six thou.

1697
01:34:22,488 --> 01:34:24,156
All right.

1698
01:34:49,181 --> 01:34:50,949
She could come apart.

1699
01:34:51,049 --> 01:34:52,584
One way to find out.

1700
01:34:55,454 --> 01:34:57,990
I thought we were keeping him
under 6,000?

1701
01:34:58,390 --> 01:34:59,925
Shut up, Don.

Shelby American.

No, no. Come on. Come on.

Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

1740
01:38:07,613 --> 01:38:10,482
Someone get this man a drink.
Someone get him a drink.

1741
01:38:26,164 --> 01:38:27,366
Oi.

1743
01:38:31,104 --> 01:38:32,604
Dirty stop out.

1744
01:38:33,006 --> 01:38:34,040
I was...

1745
01:38:34,841 --> 01:38:37,744
drawing a map, so I could
follow you on Le Mans.

1746
01:38:38,210 --> 01:38:39,478
Mmm.

1747
01:38:41,513 --> 01:38:43,482
Look at that.

1748
01:38:44,851 --> 01:38:46,385
That is spot on.

1749
01:38:46,485 --> 01:38:48,720
You are a dab hand,
very accurate.

1750
01:38:50,722 --> 01:38:52,091
Tell me about the track.

1751
01:38:52,190 --> 01:38:53,893
No, I can't, Petey.

1752
01:38:53,993 --> 01:38:55,227
Please.

1753
01:39:03,702 --> 01:39:05,872
Well, you start
at the start line.

1754
01:39:06,505 --> 01:39:08,407
Yeah, but you
actually start here

1755
01:39:08,507 --> 01:39:10,676
because you have to run
to your car at Le Mans.

1756
01:39:10,777 --> 01:39:11,878
True enough.

1757
01:39:11,978 --> 01:39:15,514
So, once your old man manages
to hobble over...

1758
01:39:16,082 --> 01:39:18,350
- and pull out...
- And not hit anyone.

1759
01:39:18,450 --> 01:39:20,419
Yes, right.

1760
01:39:21,087 --> 01:39:24,891
Then you accelerate very hard
up to Dunlop Bridge...

1761
01:39:25,858 --> 01:39:27,559
road banking away from ya

1762
01:39:27,659 --> 01:39:30,495
and down through the trees
to the Esses...

1763
01:39:30,595 --> 01:39:32,865
and accelerate up
to Tertre Rouge.

1764
01:39:32,965 --> 01:39:35,233
Critical first gear corner.

1765
01:39:35,735 --> 01:39:36,936
Fast entry.

1766
01:39:37,302 --> 01:39:39,972
Keep your speed up
for your exit onto...

1767
01:39:41,074 --> 01:39:42,240
Mulsanne.

1768
01:39:42,708 --> 01:39:45,477
Long straightaway,
hemmed in by poplars.

1769
01:39:45,577 --> 01:39:48,881
Top gear, 210 miles per hour.

1770
01:39:49,214 --> 01:39:51,283
And down to third, revs up.

1771
01:39:51,383 --> 01:39:52,919
Revs are your friend.

1772
01:39:53,618 --> 01:39:57,190
Get a maximum exit.
Let the car run free.

1773
01:39:57,289 --> 01:39:59,192
Over the brow...

1774
01:39:59,291 --> 01:40:00,592
then wham!

1775
01:40:02,095 --> 01:40:03,328
Mulsanne Corner.

1776
01:40:03,428 --> 01:40:06,099
Accelerate to Arnage

1777
01:40:06,199 --> 01:40:07,767
and then over the rise
to the White House.

1778
01:40:07,867 --> 01:40:09,736
You get that right and...

1779
01:40:12,872 --> 01:40:15,373
your first three
and a half minutes...

1780
01:40:16,241 --> 01:40:17,810
of 24 hours.

1781
01:40:18,811 --> 01:40:25,617
But... you can't make
every lap perfect.

1782
01:40:26,451 --> 01:40:28,020
But I can try.

1783
01:40:33,860 --> 01:40:35,360
All right.

1784
01:40:36,162 --> 01:40:37,662
Off to bed, you.

1785
01:40:40,233 --> 01:40:43,035
I will... wake you...

1786
01:40:44,103 --> 01:40:45,570
before I leave for France.

1787
01:40:46,205 --> 01:40:47,439
I promise.

1788
01:40:47,807 --> 01:40:49,976
Okay. Good night.

1789
01:41:17,870 --> 01:41:19,205
Eh, where's, um...

1790
01:41:19,872 --> 01:41:22,842
Where's that?
The Hotel Saint Pierre?

1791
01:41:24,210 --> 01:41:25,677
Where?

1792
01:42:11,723 --> 01:42:13,793
It's gonna
rain again tomorrow.

1793
01:42:19,098 --> 01:42:20,766
There's always rain here.

1794
01:42:24,103 --> 01:42:25,537
Start'll be dry though,

1795
01:42:25,637 --> 01:42:29,008
so we'll swap out
your tires come rain.

1796
01:42:31,710 --> 01:42:33,079
Yeah.

1797
01:42:35,380 --> 01:42:39,819
Might be smart
to sleep, Bulldog.

1798
01:42:41,821 --> 01:42:43,455
Well, you, too.

1799
01:42:44,056 --> 01:42:45,191
I'm not driving.

1800
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:51,197
That's a bloody shame, that.

1801
01:42:51,463 --> 01:42:53,498
Oh, hell,
I couldn't make this team.

1802
01:42:58,470 --> 01:43:00,572
I'm gonna go walk
the first corner.

1803
01:43:02,308 --> 01:43:03,943
I figured.

1804
01:43:14,619 --> 01:43:15,955
Counting on it.

1805
01:43:50,823 --> 01:43:52,024
Ken.

1806
01:43:52,124 --> 01:43:53,625
Chaz.

1807
01:43:58,931 --> 01:44:00,232
We'll change
the color of them seats,

1808
01:44:00,333 --> 01:44:01,300
shall we, Frost?

1809
01:44:07,472 --> 01:44:09,875
Well, if this were
a beauty pageant...

1810
01:44:10,276 --> 01:44:11,844
we just lost.

1811
01:44:12,745 --> 01:44:13,779
Looks fast, don't it?

1812
01:44:13,879 --> 01:44:16,614
Ah, looks aren't everything.

1813
01:44:20,585 --> 01:44:23,722
Scarfiotti and Bandini
start for Ferrari.

1814
01:44:29,362 --> 01:44:30,528
You can take him.

1815
01:44:30,628 --> 01:44:32,798
Four minutes, Ken.

1831

Shelby,

1852
01:48:07,746 --> 01:48:08,781
Something's hitting
the frame.

Oh, you're joking, aren't ya?

1961

Coming in.
Watch yourself, guys.

1962
01:57:57,402 --> 01:57:59,739
- Brakes. Nothing. Gone.
- Yeah.

1963
01:57:59,839 --> 01:58:02,541
All right. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

1964
01:58:04,043 --> 01:58:07,046
I had him. I almost had him.

1965
01:58:08,380 --> 01:58:10,682
Well, he's putting
another lap on us now.

1966
01:58:10,783 --> 01:58:13,618
All right. Fit it in.
Do the upper arm first.

01:58:13,718 --> 01:58:15,654
Come on, let's go.
Come in now, now. Faster.

Let's go.

1969

Upper arm first.

1970
01:58:18,690 --> 01:58:20,325
Watch the brake line
pulling it out.

1971
01:58:20,425 --> 01:58:22,427
They're doing it. The brakes.

1972
01:58:22,527 --> 01:58:23,662
<i>Now, that's gonna take...</i>

1973
01:58:23,763 --> 01:58:25,363
I said
watch the brake line.

1974
01:58:25,463 --> 01:58:27,266
Faster!
Faster! Faster!

1975
01:58:27,365 --> 01:58:28,433
Coming in.
Watch your back!

1976
01:58:28,533 --> 01:58:29,836
Jeff,
you've gotta be faster!

1977
01:58:43,582 --> 01:58:44,784
Bleed the brakes, Jeff.

1978
01:58:44,884 --> 01:58:45,852
No, no, no.

1979
01:58:46,185 --> 01:58:48,855
It's against the rules.
You cannot just change things.

1980
01:58:48,955 --> 01:58:49,922
Oh, no, no, no.

1981
01:58:50,022 --> 01:58:52,124
You show me where it says
in your book

1982
01:58:52,225 --> 01:58:54,026
that we cannot swap out
the system,

1983
01:58:54,126 --> 01:58:55,127
and then
you can disqualify us.

1984
01:58:55,228 --> 01:58:56,195
Bulldog, back off.

1985
01:58:56,295 --> 01:58:58,231
Calm down. Calm down.

1986
01:58:58,331 --> 01:58:59,664
This is not legal.

1987
01:58:59,765 --> 01:59:01,399
You show me where it says
in that little rule book

1988
01:59:01,499 --> 01:59:03,803
where I can't swap out
my upright assembly.

1989
01:59:03,903 --> 01:59:05,071
A part is a part.

1990
01:59:05,171 --> 01:59:06,873
Be it a brake caliper, a rotor,
or an upright assembly,

1991
01:59:06,973 --> 01:59:09,008
and I can swap out
any damn thing I want to.

1992
01:59:10,042 --> 01:59:11,710
We read your damn rule book.

1993
01:59:17,515 --> 01:59:19,684
Bandini's pitting.
He's pitting.

1994
01:59:26,625 --> 01:59:28,560
Oh, what a shame.

1995
01:59:28,660 --> 01:59:29,829
I think he blew a line.

1996
01:59:29,929 --> 01:59:31,396
Well, he was trying
to keep up with you.

1997
01:59:41,539 --> 01:59:43,776
I don't speak Italian,
but he ain't happy.

1998
01:59:55,187 --> 01:59:56,789
Get me out of here, Pops.

1999
01:59:56,889 --> 01:59:58,090
- Come on!
- All right.

2000
01:59:58,190 --> 01:59:59,424
Come on!

2001
01:59:59,524 --> 02:00:01,193
Almost there, Ken.
Almost there.

2002
02:00:01,559 --> 02:00:02,560
How's it looking, buddy?

2003
02:00:02,661 --> 02:00:03,930
One pump, and we're good.

2004
02:00:04,397 --> 02:00:05,530
Car's yours, Ken.

2005
02:00:05,630 --> 02:00:06,799
All right, listen,
you can still take him,

2006
02:00:06,899 --> 02:00:08,134
but you gotta pass him twice.

2007
02:00:08,234 --> 02:00:10,468
I get it. Pass him twice.

2011
02:01:24,509 --> 02:01:26,012
He's off his pace.

2012
02:01:27,645 --> 02:01:29,547
He doesn't trust the car yet.

2013
02:01:29,982 --> 02:01:32,885
Come on, Ken.
I gave you new brakes, buddy.

2014
02:01:39,125 --> 02:01:40,525
All right.

2015
02:01:41,526 --> 02:01:43,695
What did you come here for?

2016
02:01:45,530 --> 02:01:46,932
Let's do it.

2017
02:02:11,357 --> 02:02:13,225
That's it! Come on!

2018
02:02:24,370 --> 02:02:25,771
He ain't done it yet.

2019
02:02:29,442 --> 02:02:31,643
He needs to take
another lap on him.

2020
02:02:55,301 --> 02:02:56,802
He needs to pit soon.

2021
02:02:56,902 --> 02:02:59,604
He needs to catch
Bandini first.

2022
02:03:09,515 --> 02:03:11,183
All right, you bastard.

2023
02:03:12,351 --> 02:03:13,819
Let's do this again.

2024
02:03:43,449 --> 02:03:44,850
Come on, now.

2025
02:03:45,384 --> 02:03:47,353
That's my girl!
That's my girl!

2026
02:04:07,506 --> 02:04:10,209
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

2027
02:04:10,643 --> 02:04:11,844
Bloody hell!

2028
02:04:25,958 --> 02:04:28,494
He did it. We're in the lead.

2029
02:04:28,594 --> 02:04:29,895
Are we in the lead?

2030
02:04:29,995 --> 02:04:31,931
What about Bandini?

2031
02:04:32,364 --> 02:04:33,799
Where's Bandini?

2032
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:36,202
They're done. Finished.

2033
02:04:36,669 --> 02:04:37,937
Ferrari's over.

2034
02:04:38,037 --> 02:04:40,039
McLaren's four minutes
behind him in a GT.

2035
02:04:40,139 --> 02:04:43,776

Nah, let him sleep.

2041
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:23,649

- Unbelievable.

2042
02:05:23,749 --> 02:05:24,984
- Hello.
- Mr. Ford.

2043
02:05:25,084 --> 02:05:26,085
We're not
quite there yet, but...

2044
02:05:26,185 --> 02:05:27,620
You missed a good meal.

2045
02:05:27,720 --> 02:05:29,421
There he is. There he is.

2046
02:05:31,323 --> 02:05:32,558
Brief me, Leo.

2047
02:05:33,225 --> 02:05:35,494
We're running
one, two, three, Mr. Ford.

2048
02:05:36,629 --> 02:05:37,463
Who's in the lead?

2049
02:05:37,563 --> 02:05:39,431
Hulme, Miles.

2050
02:05:41,700 --> 02:05:43,435
You know, I was thinking,
Mr. Ford...

2051
02:05:44,270 --> 02:05:47,840
wouldn't it be great
if all three Fords lined up

2052
02:05:47,940 --> 02:05:50,109
and crossed the finish line
at the exact same time?

2053
02:05:50,744 --> 02:05:52,746
They all lined up
and came home together.

2054
02:05:52,845 --> 02:05:54,947
Ford. Ford. Ford.

2055
02:05:55,514 --> 02:05:58,050
I don't think we can
actually do that, sir, but...

2056
02:05:59,285 --> 02:06:00,519
Why not?

2057
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:03,689
Miles is laps ahead, Leo.

2058
02:06:03,789 --> 02:06:06,492
What would you have him do,
slow down?

2059
02:06:07,793 --> 02:06:09,128
Yeah.

2060
02:06:16,001 --> 02:06:18,304
Mr. Ford wants Miles
to slow down.

2061
02:06:18,404 --> 02:06:20,806
He wants all three cars to
cross at the exact same time.

2062
02:06:20,906 --> 02:06:22,808
He thinks it'll be
a historic moment for Ford.

2063
02:06:22,908 --> 02:06:24,843
It'll make a great photograph.

2064
02:06:26,145 --> 02:06:28,748
Shelby, Miles needs to be
a team player here,

2065
02:06:28,847 --> 02:06:30,182
and so do you.

2066
02:06:30,282 --> 02:06:32,217
You gonna tell him,
or you need me to?

2067
02:06:33,787 --> 02:06:36,322
Don't go near my driver.
Go on.

2068
02:06:37,156 --> 02:06:38,590
This is what Mr. Ford wants.

2069
02:06:38,691 --> 02:06:39,892
Go on now.

2070
02:06:40,326 --> 02:06:42,194
- He expects loyalty.
- Go on.

2071
02:06:58,844 --> 02:07:01,380
- Guys, let's go. Come on.
- All right, look lively, boys.

2072
02:07:01,480 --> 02:07:02,648
Let's go. Frosty.

2073
02:07:02,749 --> 02:07:04,249
Yeah, coming.

Oh.

2077

It's off the scale, innit?

2078
02:07:21,233 --> 02:07:23,135
They want you to slow down.

2079
02:07:27,139 --> 02:07:28,674
Run that by me again.

2080
02:07:29,208 --> 02:07:30,909
They want you to slow down.

2081
02:07:33,412 --> 02:07:35,013
You're outshining
their car, Ken.

2082
02:07:35,114 --> 02:07:36,850
You're four minutes up
on McLaren.

2083
02:07:36,949 --> 02:07:38,350
The Deuce wants
the three Fords

2084
02:07:38,450 --> 02:07:41,120
to cross the finish line
one, two, three, all together.

2085
02:07:46,425 --> 02:07:48,660
They're asking that
you be a team player...

2086
02:07:50,195 --> 02:07:51,765
and make that photograph
happen for 'em.

2087
02:07:51,865 --> 02:07:55,334
That photograph.
That's good.

2088
02:07:55,835 --> 02:07:58,437
That is good. Mmm.

2089
02:08:00,406 --> 02:08:02,374
Ken, even if
you tie for first...

2090
02:08:03,242 --> 02:08:05,177
you'd still be the first man
ever to win...

2091
02:08:05,677 --> 02:08:08,480
Sebring, Daytona, and Le Mans
in the same year.

2092
02:08:09,081 --> 02:08:10,582
You'd have the triple crown.

2093
02:08:17,956 --> 02:08:19,391
Look, I ain't get...

2094
02:08:20,659 --> 02:08:22,494
I haven't been able to get you
to follow an order

2095
02:08:22,594 --> 02:08:23,996
since day one.

2096
02:08:24,096 --> 02:08:26,165
Whatever you wanna do
is fine with me.

2097
02:08:27,801 --> 02:08:29,368
My choice?

2098
02:08:30,737 --> 02:08:32,104
Your choice.

2099
02:08:38,544 --> 02:08:40,546
The engine's
running at boiling.

2100
02:08:40,646 --> 02:08:42,114
The brakes are shot.

2101
02:08:44,983 --> 02:08:46,418
How was that?

2102
02:08:47,986 --> 02:08:49,021
Taken care of.

2103
02:08:49,321 --> 02:08:50,956
The car's yours, Ken.

2104
02:08:51,056 --> 02:08:52,524
Ken, the car's yours.

2105
02:08:53,625 --> 02:08:54,626
Ken!

2106
02:08:54,727 --> 02:08:56,361
Car's yours, Ken.

2107
02:09:29,294 --> 02:09:31,196
<i>It's the Fords
that are the cars to beat,</i>

2108
02:09:31,296 --> 02:09:32,899
<i>claiming the top three
positions...</i>

2109
02:09:32,998 --> 02:09:34,166
What the hell is he doing?

2110
02:09:34,266 --> 02:09:35,667
<i>...led by Ken Miles
in Ford number 1...</i>

2111
02:09:36,970 --> 02:09:38,103
<i>If you're not</i>

2112
02:09:38,203 --> 02:09:39,304
<i>watching this right now...</i>

2113
02:09:39,404 --> 02:09:40,606
Don't answer that.

2114
02:09:40,706 --> 02:09:41,975
Get away from it.

2115
02:09:42,074 --> 02:09:43,509
Get away from it.

2116
02:09:43,609 --> 02:09:46,211
<i>Ken Miles in Ford
number 1 is demonstrating</i>

2117
02:09:46,311 --> 02:09:49,314
<i>why he's one of the top drivers
here at Le Mans</i>

2118
02:09:49,414 --> 02:09:51,951
<i>with an outstanding display
of skill.</i>

2119
02:09:52,050 --> 02:09:54,019
<i>Keep an eye on Ford number 1.</i>

2120
02:10:10,837 --> 02:10:12,404
He's gonna break
his own record.

2121
02:10:12,504 --> 02:10:13,740
Shut up.

2122
02:10:22,548 --> 02:10:23,582
Wait for it.

2123
02:10:25,617 --> 02:10:26,786
Wait for it.

2124
02:10:30,322 --> 02:10:31,256
Now.

2125
02:10:34,326 --> 02:10:36,796
Miles. Miles. Miles.

2126
02:10:36,896 --> 02:10:39,164
Miles. Miles. Miles.

2127
02:10:39,264 --> 02:10:41,433
Miles. Miles. Miles.

2128
02:11:17,003 --> 02:11:19,839
3:30.6.
That's another record.

2129
02:11:23,943 --> 02:11:26,111
<i>Another lap record
falls to Ken Miles...</i>

2130
02:11:26,211 --> 02:11:27,579
It's a perfect lap.

2131
02:11:27,679 --> 02:11:29,481
<i>...breaking his own record
and virtually guaranteeing</i>

2132
02:11:29,581 --> 02:11:31,951
<i>first place
for Shelby American</i>

2133
02:11:32,051 --> 02:11:33,485
<i>and their exciting GT40.</i>

2134
02:11:33,585 --> 02:11:35,487
<i>Ken Miles
in Shelby America's</i>

2135
02:11:35,587 --> 02:11:39,092
<i>Ford number 1
just beat his own lap record.</i>

2136
02:11:39,191 --> 02:11:41,060
<i>Three minutes
and 30.6 seconds...</i>

2137
02:11:41,159 --> 02:11:42,160
Bring him in.

2138
02:11:42,260 --> 02:11:44,030
Right now!
He's outta control.

2139
02:11:44,396 --> 02:11:46,632
Now, you bring him in
before he wrecks that car

2140
02:11:46,733 --> 02:11:47,867
and we don't finish.

2141
02:11:50,069 --> 02:11:51,403
Bring him in, Shelby,

2142
02:11:51,503 --> 02:11:54,406
or I will get you banned
from the SCCA and the FIA.

2143
02:11:56,075 --> 02:11:57,910
Ken Miles is behind
the wheel, Leo.

2144
02:11:58,310 --> 02:12:00,212
That's his car to the finish.

2145
02:12:01,748 --> 02:12:03,783
<i>H-A-P-P-Y</i>

2146
02:12:03,883 --> 02:12:05,985
<i>I'm H-A-P-P-Y</i>

2147
02:12:06,085 --> 02:12:08,755
<i>I know I am, I'm sure I am</i>

2148
02:12:09,521 --> 02:12:10,890
Woo!

2149
02:12:11,758 --> 02:12:12,859
Oh.

2150
02:13:35,208 --> 02:13:36,976
Come on, lads, where are ya?

2151
02:13:47,619 --> 02:13:48,821
<i>That is quite a sight to see.</i>

2152
02:13:48,921 --> 02:13:49,989
What's he doing?

2153
02:13:50,589 --> 02:13:51,958
Mum, why is he slowing down?

2154
02:13:52,058 --> 02:13:54,326
<i>...the second and third place
Fords to close ranks.</i>

2155
02:14:24,190 --> 02:14:26,926
The three Fords are going
to cross the line together.

2156
02:14:27,026 --> 02:14:29,061
Ken Miles slowed down.
He waited for them.

2157
02:14:29,162 --> 02:14:31,630
- <i>Here are the Fords lined up in a row...</i>
- Dad. No.

2158
02:14:31,731 --> 02:14:32,965
- It's all right.
- Dad.

2159
02:14:33,065 --> 02:14:35,333
It's all right.
Look, he's bringing them in.

2160
02:14:35,433 --> 02:14:37,737
- <i>Led by Ken Miles...</i>
- He's bringing them all in together.

2161
02:14:37,837 --> 02:14:39,704
<i>...certainly
the leader of this group</i>

2162
02:14:39,806 --> 02:14:41,841
- <i>and owner of the Le Mans lap record...</i>
- Good for you.

2163
02:14:41,941 --> 02:14:44,309
- <i>...set just moments ago.</i>
- Good for you, Ken.

2164
02:15:02,295 --> 02:15:04,997
Yeah! Yeah!

2165
02:15:11,469 --> 02:15:13,039
Look at that.

2166
02:15:15,340 --> 02:15:17,009
- Well done, Leo.
- You too, Don.

2167
02:15:34,227 --> 02:15:35,393
<i>Please stand by.</i>

2168
02:15:35,493 --> 02:15:36,996
<i>Final results
are under review.</i>

2169
02:15:37,096 --> 02:15:39,265
...is explain to me
how he's finished first

2170
02:15:39,364 --> 02:15:40,665
and he's not won the race?

2171
02:15:40,766 --> 02:15:42,969
Because McLaren
started from further,

2172
02:15:43,069 --> 02:15:44,402
so he came in...
he won.

2173
02:15:44,502 --> 02:15:45,537
Look, it's not a tie.

2174
02:15:45,637 --> 02:15:46,705
No, because McLaren...

2175
02:15:46,806 --> 02:15:48,140
Because McLaren started
further back,

2176
02:15:48,241 --> 02:15:50,042
he's saying he's traveled
that little bit further,

2177
02:15:50,142 --> 02:15:51,443
so he's won and not Ken.

2178
02:15:51,543 --> 02:15:53,411
That is bullshit.
That's bullshit.

2179
02:15:53,511 --> 02:15:55,614
Shel! Hold on!

2180
02:16:09,427 --> 02:16:11,130
- Where's the tie?
- Hey, hey, hey.

2181
02:16:11,230 --> 02:16:12,331
Where's the goddamn tie?

2182
02:16:12,430 --> 02:16:13,498
What?

2183
02:16:13,598 --> 02:16:14,800
- You son of a bitch!
- Hey, Shelby!

2184
02:16:14,901 --> 02:16:16,369
- You knew!
- No, I didn't know!

2185
02:16:16,468 --> 02:16:18,703
- That's enough! Enough!
- Get off me! Hey!

2186
02:16:19,205 --> 02:16:20,639
Bruce.

2187
02:16:20,740 --> 02:16:22,742
Nice race, mate. Congrats.

2188
02:16:44,462 --> 02:16:45,932
Shel!

2189
02:16:50,336 --> 02:16:51,670
They robbed you, Ken.

2190
02:16:51,771 --> 02:16:53,538
<i>Here is the clarification.</i>

2191
02:16:53,638 --> 02:16:56,008
<i>Though the drivers finished
the race in a heat,</i>

2192
02:16:56,108 --> 02:16:58,411
<i>McLaren has been ruled
the winner</i>

2193
02:16:58,510 --> 02:16:59,711
<i>as he started
from farther back.</i>

2194
02:16:59,812 --> 02:17:01,380
Some bullshit
technicality.

2195
02:17:01,479 --> 02:17:05,483
<i>Final results. Ford number 2,
driven by McLaren and Amon,</i>

2196
02:17:05,583 --> 02:17:06,919
<i>is the winner.</i>

2197
02:17:07,019 --> 02:17:09,587
<i>Ford number 1, driven
by Miles and Hulme,</i>

2198
02:17:09,688 --> 02:17:10,923
<i>second place.</i>

2199
02:17:11,023 --> 02:17:13,625
<i>In third place,
Bucknum and Hutcherson</i>

2200
02:17:13,726 --> 02:17:15,294
<i>in Ford number 5.</i>

2201
02:17:15,394 --> 02:17:16,829
I never should've asked you.

2202
02:17:23,102 --> 02:17:24,770
Selling cars, huh?

2203
02:17:27,440 --> 02:17:28,941
That's what they do.

2204
02:17:29,875 --> 02:17:33,145
Well, you promised me
the drive.

2205
02:17:36,048 --> 02:17:37,183
Not the win.

2206
02:17:38,384 --> 02:17:39,952
It was a hell of a drive.

2207
02:17:40,853 --> 02:17:42,687
She's a hell of a machine.

2208
02:17:43,289 --> 02:17:44,824
Oh, she's fast.

2209
02:17:46,459 --> 02:17:47,994
Could be faster.

2210
02:17:49,729 --> 02:17:51,263
The 7 liter's sweet...

2211
02:17:51,964 --> 02:17:53,165
but, uh...

2212
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:55,801
we still need
a lighter chassis.

2213
02:17:55,901 --> 02:17:59,671
I was thinking
bonded aluminium.

2214
02:17:59,772 --> 02:18:02,842
It's a ground-up rebuild,
but if it works...

2215
02:18:03,409 --> 02:18:05,510
we can lose
a couple hundred pounds.

2216
02:18:05,610 --> 02:18:07,612
Well, what the hell
are we doing here?

2217
02:18:08,948 --> 02:18:11,150
Let me take a shower,
get a cup of tea...

2218
02:18:11,683 --> 02:18:13,352
ham and cheese cob
or something.

2219
02:18:14,086 --> 02:18:16,155
We're gonna get
the bastards next year.

2220
02:18:39,945 --> 02:18:42,680
Got a bit of fuel left
in the tank.

2221
02:18:43,715 --> 02:18:45,583
What do you think
of those honeycomb panels?

2222
02:18:45,683 --> 02:18:47,353
What you were looking for?

2223
02:18:47,685 --> 02:18:49,055
Don't know yet.

2224
02:19:14,612 --> 02:19:16,348
She looks pretty good.

2225
02:19:26,559 --> 02:19:30,229
<i>There's a point
at 7,000 RPM...</i>

2226
02:19:31,497 --> 02:19:33,732
<i>where everything fades.</i>

2227
02:19:36,001 --> 02:19:38,636
<i>The machine becomes
weightless.</i>

2228
02:19:39,505 --> 02:19:40,840
<i>Just disappears.</i>

2229
02:19:41,540 --> 02:19:42,575
Yeah!

2230
02:19:42,674 --> 02:19:43,708
<i>And all that's left</i>

2231
02:19:43,809 --> 02:19:44,844
<i>is a body...</i>

2232
02:19:44,944 --> 02:19:46,946
<i>moving through space and time.</i>

2233
02:19:50,382 --> 02:19:52,650
<i>7,000 RPM.</i>

2234
02:19:53,552 --> 02:19:54,987
<i>That's where you meet it.</i>

2235
02:19:56,989 --> 02:19:58,690
<i>You feel it coming.</i>

2236
02:19:58,791 --> 02:20:01,060
<i>It creeps up on you,
close in your ear.</i>

2237
02:20:09,401 --> 02:20:11,003
<i>Asks you a question.</i>

2238
02:20:12,004 --> 02:20:13,973
<i>The only question
that matters.</i>

2239
02:20:19,778 --> 02:20:21,080
Get the van!

2240
02:20:22,414 --> 02:20:23,949
<i>"Who are you?"</i>

2241
02:20:57,516 --> 02:20:58,651
What do you think?

2242
02:20:58,751 --> 02:21:01,220
It's fantastic.
Feels really good.

2243
02:21:01,820 --> 02:21:03,222
Nice and smooth.

2244
02:21:04,089 --> 02:21:06,058
No vibration in the box.
Feels really strong.

2245
02:21:06,158 --> 02:21:08,360
You drove it
for less than an hour.

2246
02:21:08,794 --> 02:21:10,729
You can't tell shit
after an hour.

2247
02:21:10,829 --> 02:21:14,300
Go for seven even,
that'd be 14 all in.

2248
02:21:14,400 --> 02:21:15,734
Hey, Shel.

2249
02:21:25,377 --> 02:21:28,614
Hey, Shel, that guy,
you know the one in the hat,

2250
02:21:28,713 --> 02:21:31,350
he's ready to close
on those two 427s.

2251
02:21:31,450 --> 02:21:33,919
His and hers. Full freight.

2252
02:21:34,687 --> 02:21:37,256
They, uh, flew in
from Galveston.

2253
02:21:37,356 --> 02:21:38,723
Uh-huh.

2254
02:21:39,858 --> 02:21:43,996
Uh, I need you to come outside
for maybe a minute.

2255
02:21:44,730 --> 02:21:46,098
And do what?

2256
02:21:47,733 --> 02:21:49,201
Be Carroll Shelby.

2257
02:21:50,169 --> 02:21:52,738
Tell them a story,
spin a few magic words.

2258
02:21:53,639 --> 02:21:56,375
What does that mean?
"Magic words"?

2259
02:21:57,576 --> 02:21:58,677
It means...

2260
02:21:59,111 --> 02:22:01,113
come outside and say hello

2261
02:22:01,213 --> 02:22:03,515
and make them feel good
about their purchase.

2262
02:22:03,616 --> 02:22:04,817
They're getting the damn cars.

2263
02:22:04,917 --> 02:22:06,685
That's what they get
for their money, Phil.

2264
02:22:06,785 --> 02:22:07,953
Now, either they want 'em
or they don't.

2265
02:22:08,053 --> 02:22:10,122
- Am I some kind of a lounge act?
- No.

2266
02:22:10,222 --> 02:22:11,857
Am I here to talk people
into things?

2267
02:22:23,202 --> 02:22:25,237
It's been six months, Shel.

2268
02:22:26,572 --> 02:22:28,507
Six months.

2269
02:22:32,511 --> 02:22:35,114
Sometimes they don't
get out of the car.

2270
02:23:10,482 --> 02:23:11,884
Peter!

2271
02:23:12,752 --> 02:23:15,354
Peter, come and take
the garbage out.

2272
02:23:15,454 --> 02:23:16,889
Mr. Shelby.

2273
02:23:18,390 --> 02:23:19,825
Oh, hello, Pete.

2274
02:23:21,728 --> 02:23:23,329
I remember that wrench.

2275
02:23:24,530 --> 02:23:26,265
My dad threw it at you.

2276
02:23:27,599 --> 02:23:28,934
I believe he did.

2277
02:23:29,736 --> 02:23:31,103
Why?

2278
02:23:33,706 --> 02:23:35,040
Oh.

2279
02:23:35,874 --> 02:23:38,210
I think I probably said
something to him.

2280
02:23:38,977 --> 02:23:40,512
Called him a few names.

2281
02:23:42,681 --> 02:23:44,149
That's right.

2282
02:23:52,826 --> 02:23:54,393
Do you wanna speak to my mum?

2283
02:23:55,127 --> 02:23:57,296
Well, I did. Uh...

2284
02:23:57,963 --> 02:24:00,165
I came to say hello,
check in on her and...

2285
02:24:04,870 --> 02:24:07,005
Then I started thinking
that sometimes...

2286
02:24:09,608 --> 02:24:11,745
uh, words...

2287
02:24:12,277 --> 02:24:16,382
just... ar-are not useful.

2288
02:24:22,187 --> 02:24:24,590
Tools are useful 'cause
you can make stuff with 'em

2289
02:24:24,690 --> 02:24:26,492
and you can fix stuff
with 'em.

2290
02:24:27,861 --> 02:24:29,461
Here.

2291
02:24:30,362 --> 02:24:31,497
Thanks.

2292
02:24:40,139 --> 02:24:41,940
Your daddy was, uh...

2293
02:24:45,177 --> 02:24:47,212
He was your friend.

2294
02:24:53,018 --> 02:24:54,386
Yes, he was.

2295
02:24:55,755 --> 02:24:57,423
Yes, sir.

2296
02:25:02,161 --> 02:25:04,696
And he thought you was
just finer than frog fur.

2297
02:25:09,869 --> 02:25:11,503
Peter!

2298
02:25:16,175 --> 02:25:18,377
I think I've gotta go
help my mum.

2299
02:25:20,446 --> 02:25:23,148
What are you doing here then?
Go on.

2300
02:25:23,949 --> 02:25:25,451
Bye.

2301
02:27:08,220 --> 02:27:13,220
