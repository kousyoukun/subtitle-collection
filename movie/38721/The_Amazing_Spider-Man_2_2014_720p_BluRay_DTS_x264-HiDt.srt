我们这么想也是理所当然的
We're supposed to feel that way.

00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,690
生命的价值
what makes life valuable

140
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,190
恰恰在于它并非永垂不朽的
is that it doesn't last forever.

141
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,890
生命因其有限而弥足珍贵
What makes it precious is that it ends.

142
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,930
现在的我最深有体会
And I know that now more than ever.

143
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,980
我之所以要在今天这样的场合
And I say it,

144
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,730
说出这样的话
today of all days,

145
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,610
就是想要提醒大家  活着即是幸福
to remind us that time is luck.

146
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,910
所以不要浪费生命为他人而活
So don't waste it living someone else's life.

147
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,830
要活出你自己的价值
Make yours count for something.

148
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,050
为你珍视的事物奋斗
Fight for what matters to you.

149
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,700
心无旁骛
No matter what.

150
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,340
即便最后功亏一篑
Because even if we fall short,

151
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,140
但至少我们曾精彩的活过
what better way is there to live?

152
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,140
没事了
All right!

153
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,740
我拿走了  这不是你的东西
I'll take that. That's not yours.

154

彼得・帕克
Peter Park...

162
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,060
对不起
I'm sorry.

163
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,250
等等  再来一次  再来一次
Ha, ha. Wait, do that again. Do that again. Oh.

164
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:55,300
彼得  我差点就要去偷长袍和帽子替你上台了
Peter, for Lord's sakes, I almost stole a cap and gown to run up there myself.

165
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,720
我很想看到那场面  那样肯定很棒  别照了  看  这是给你的
I'd love to have seen that. That would've been awesome. No, no, this is for you.

166
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720
-我真为你感到自豪  -这是你应得的
- I am so proud of you. - You earned it.

167

亲爱的  我真为你感到自豪
Sweetheart, I'm so proud of you.

168

我知道你的本叔要说的第一句话就是...
I know the first thing your Uncle Ben would say.

169
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,440
是啊  我也知道
Yeah, I know too.

170
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,820
"抓紧时间  这下玩够了  你得步入社会找份工作"
“You better hurry up, party's over. You gotta get a job."

171
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,150
好吧  他接下来会说  不要随波逐流  要走出属于你自己的道路
The second thing he would say, "Don't just follow the path, make your own trail."

172
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,660

我需要你向我保证
So I want you to promise me something, okay?

209
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,710
别把格温牵扯进来
Leave Gwen out of it.

210

答应我
Promise me that.

我不清楚我到底在做什么
I don't know what I'm doing.

217
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,880
是我父亲  对吗
It's my father, isn't it?

218
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,390
是的
Yeah.

219
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,680
我到哪都能看到他
I see him everywhere I go.

220
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,480
我不能...  我不知道该怎么做  他总是在我的脑海里挥之不去
I can't... I don't know what to do. And I can't get him out of my head.

221
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,530
-我以为我们已经把这事谈清楚了  -是的  我知道

-这不是他能决定的  -格温

我向他保证过不把你牵扯进来
I promised him that I would keep away from you.

And now I'm gonna come and eat dinner with your family.

225
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,610
我怎么能这样做  这让我变成什么人了
How can I do this? What does this make me?

226
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,960
我不知道这样做让你成了什么人
I don't know, what does that make you?

227
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,740
这让我没法心安理得地活着
It makes me not able to live with myself.

228
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,620
-我以为这意味着你爱我  -我是爱你的
- I thought that it meant you loved me. - I do love you.

229
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,000
我爱你
I love you.

230
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,460
那这还不够吗
Then why isn't that enough?

231
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,140
要是你因为我出了什么事
Because what if something happens to you

232
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,900
就像发生在他身上的一样
just like it happened to him because of me?

233
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,320
-不  等等  别说话  -听着  不
- No, wait, wait, wait. - Listen. No, n...

234
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,390
我不能让这样的事情发生
I cannot let that happen.

235
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,110
听我说
Listen to me.

236
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,190
你是蜘蛛侠
You're Spider-Man...

237
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,980
我爱蜘蛛侠
and I love that.

238
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,330
但我更爱彼得・帕克
But I love Peter Parker more.

239
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,160
这对我来说是值得的
That's worth it to me.

240
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,090
我不能连你也失去
I can't lose you too.

241
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:05,160
就因为你不想失去我  我们就不能在一起吗
If because you can't lose me, we can't be together,

242
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,750
这样做对谁有好处
who does that work out for, Peter?

243
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,180
我做不到  对不起  格温
I can't. I'm sorry, Gwen.

244
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,670
哇
Wow.

245
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,440
你这样一次又一次的
You have done this to me

246
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,030
伤害我  彼得
again and again, Peter.

247
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,680
我再也受不了了
I can't live like this.

248
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,780
我要和你分手
I break up with you.

249
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,280
我和你分手
I break up with you.

我们家没有烟囱
We have no chimney.

猜猜今天谁过生日

难怪你来这里
That's why you're here.

323

你记得我的生日
You remembered my birthday.

324
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,290
虽然你忙着打击犯罪  但你还是
All the crime-fighting you've been doing, and all of a sudden,

325
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:35,200
抽空来看望卑微的我  这真是太好了
you take time out to come visit little old me. Max. It's amazing to...

326
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,250
不过当然了
But of course you would.

327
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,000
你没理由不来看我
Why wouldn't you visit me?

328

我们是最好的朋友
We're best friends.

329

你干嘛呢  你居然给我做了个蛋糕
What are you doing? You made me a cake?

330
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,690
人们没有看到你为世人做的这些小事
People don't get a chance to see these small, kind things that you do for people.

331
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,730
我知道媒体是怎么说你的
I know what they say about you in the press

332
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,110
但我不在意他们的看法  我了解真实的你
but it doesn't matter to me. I know the real you.

333
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,950
因为你是如此超凡脱俗
Because you're amazing.

334
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,240
这才是媒体该说的
Wow. That's what the press needs.

335
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,480
他们应该称你为超凡蜘蛛侠
They should call you The Amazing Spider-Man.

336
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,570
你喜欢这称呼吗  小蜘蛛
You like that, Spidey?

超凡的一天

00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,460
好吧  39号线出问题了
Yeah. Circuit 39.

342
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:25,180
我没迟到  哈维  我会在15分钟后赶到那里的
I'm not late, Harvey. I'll be there in 15 minutes.

343
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:28,390
我只是想知道你能不能找个服务员
I just wanna know if you can find another waitress

344
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,980
给我替下班  因为我开始参加
to replace me because I start my training rounds

345
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,310
医院的训练了
at the hospital.

346
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:35,110
不过你别和彼得提起这个  我不想让他知道
And don't mention this to Peter. I don't want him to know.

347
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,650
他会担心的
Because he'll worry.

348
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:39,280
好的  没问题
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Okay, you got it.

349
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,230
星期四上两班
Uh, double shift on Thursday.

350
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,980
好的  再见
Okay, bye.

351
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,480
-和谁打电话呢  -哈维

352
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:51,620
-一天上两班啊  -偶尔为之
- Doing a double shift, huh? - Sometimes.

353
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,130
闲着也是闲着  我很喜欢那些同事们
Got nothing else to do. I like the girls.

354
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:57,910
我想念本了  我还能往饼干罐里多存点外快
I miss Ben. Gives me a little extra in the cookie jar. Heh.

355
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,590
嗯
Mm.

356
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:03,180
我这还有几张蜘蛛侠的照片  应该能帮上点忙
Well, I sold another couple of photos to the Bugle, so that ought to help.

357
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,510
如果那人能给你公允的薪酬  那才真的能帮上忙
Yeah, it would really help if that guy would pay you a fair wage.

358
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,220
詹姆逊给我的薪酬很公允
Jameson pays me a fair wage.

359
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,810
只不过是按1961年算的
If it was 1961, he pays me a fair wage.

360
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:14,480
嘿  等等  你去哪呢  你要干什么  不  洗衣服的活我来干
Hey, wait. What are you doing? What are you doing? No, I do the laundry.

- I'm doing my laundry. - No, I do the laundry.

不  这是我做的活  从你6岁开始  我就一直帮你洗衣服
No, this is my job. I've been doing your laundry since you were 6 years old.

363
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,360
我明白  但我现在是个大学生了
I understand that. I'm in college now.

364
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,320
我想是时候自己洗我的脏衣服了
I think it's time that I took care of my own dirty underwear.

365
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,080
上次你洗衣服的时候  你把所有的衣服都染得红蓝相间
Last time you did the laundry, you turned everything blue and red

366
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,330
-所以不行  -那是无心之失
- so no. - That was a mistake.

367
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,580
我当时在洗美国国旗
Because I was washing the American flag.

-我的...  我可以只...  -没有人会去洗国旗
- My... Can I please just...? - No one washes a flag.

369
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,130
我会  但我不会再做了  这事别再提了
I do, and I won't anymore. Forget it.

370
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,380
-这是我的洗衣机  -好吧  只是些内衣裤罢了
- This is my machine. - Fine. It's just underwear.

371
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,050
这是我的洗衣房  我家  我的洗衣机
This is my laundry, my home, my machine.

372
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,750
你给我退后  吃你的早餐去
Back off, eat your breakfast.

373
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:48,470
遵命  洗衣警长  我晚点再洗
All right, laundry sheriff. I'll do it later.

374
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,060
-我来洗  -不了
- I'll do it. - No, forget it.

375
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,100
-把衣服给我  -我另找时间自己洗
- Give it to me. - I'll do it some other time.

376
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,730
-嘿  -不好意思
- Hey. - Excuse me.

377
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,220

A lot of jam. Come on, come on, come on.

404
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,560
大多数人会直接让门关上
Most people would have just let those close.

405
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,440
人们总是无视其他人

406

今天是你的生日吗

Oh, yeah. Well, I... They... Friends of mine made this flyer up.

417
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,510
我今晚在一个大俱乐部举行生日派对

<i>冲进大火现场</i>
<i>hanging out near the blaze.</i>

423
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,220
这么被整个世界所关注一定是件很爽的事情吧
It must be cool, huh? To have the whole world look at you like that?

424
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,690
你知道嘛  蜘蛛侠曾经救过我一次
You know, Spider-Man saved my life one time.

425
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,610
城市的茫茫人海中  他救了
Out of all the people in the whole city, he saved

426
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,020
我
me.

427
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,900
他说他需要我
He said he needed me.

428
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:17,150
那感觉一定很棒吧
That must be a good feeling.

429
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,690
63楼到了
Sixty-third floor.

430
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,190

欢迎回家
Welcome home.

433
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:59,030
里面有点暗
It's dark in there.

434
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,360
你的眼睛会慢慢适应的
Your eyes will adjust.

435
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,530
这样也许更好些
It's better this way.

436
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,890
爸
Dad.

437
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:44,570
这不是我想象中的死法
This is not how I imagined I would die.

438
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,660
看着我的儿子
Looking at my son

439
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,990
就跟看见个陌生人一样
and seeing a stranger.

440
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:54,910
你前途无量  哈利
You have such potential, Harry.

441
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,680
你智慧超群
Such fierce intelligence,

442
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,770
但你却将它们拒之门外
and you're throwing it all away.

443
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:03,170
不  是你把我拒之门外
No, you threw me away.

444
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,590
我11岁的时候你就把我扔到寄宿学校
You kicked me off to boarding school when I was 11.

445
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,240
在我16岁生日的时候
On my 16th birthday,

446
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,200
你送给我一瓶苏格兰威士忌
you sent me Scotch.

447
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,570
或者说是你的一个助理送的
Or one of your assistants did.

448
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:19,770
估计是后者  因为卡上写着
I'm pretty sure because the card read:

449
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:24,370
"请笑纳  诺曼・奥斯本敬上"
“With compliments, Norman Osborn."

450
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:27,250
我不期望你会原谅我
I don't expect forgiveness from you

451
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,120
再也不会了
anymore.

452
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,800
我不相信奇迹
I don't believe in miracles.

453
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,760
你永远也不会明白
How could you possibly understand

454
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,800
你的童年必须被牺牲掉
that your childhood had to be sacrificed

455
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,960
以换取更重要的东西
for something greater?

456
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,630
不只是为了我
And not just for me.

457
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,300
也为了你自己
For you!

458
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,510
你的手是不是已经开始经常抽搐了
Has your hand started to twitch yet?

459
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:57,060
当你夜不能寐时  就会感到它在骚动
When you lay awake and you feel it coming,

460
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,110
隐藏在你的皮肤里
hiding under your skin,

461
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,440
伺机而动
waiting to show itself.

462
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,870
等着向你展示
To show you

463
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:09,040
你的真正面目
who you really are.

464
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:15,870
逆转录细胞增生症
Retroviral hyperplasia.

465
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,170
我从未告诉过你
I never told you...

466
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,420
这病是遗传病
that it's genetic.

467
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,090
我们的这病
Our disease,

468
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,420
是奥斯本家族的诅咒
the Osborn curse.

469
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,810
在你这年纪时开始发作
And it began at your age.

470
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,600
让我看看
Let me see it.

471
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,690
你的手  伸过来我看看
Your hand. Give it to me.

472
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:52,160
我留给你最大的遗产
The greatest inheritance I can give you

473
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,130
不只是财富
isn't merely money.

474
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,530
而是这个病
It's this.

475
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,550
我的毕生心血
The sum total of all my work.

476
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:03,920
我为续命所做的一切
Everything I did to stay alive.

477
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,600
或许你能完成
Maybe you can succeed

478
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,880
我未竟的事业
where I failed.

What do you mean? I'm up here. It's dangerous.

533
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,420
-抱歉  麦克斯  -喂
- Sorry, Max. - Hello?

534
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,250
好吧  我自己来  我自己唱生日歌
Fine. I'll do it myself. And sing my birthday song too.

535
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,180
简直难以置信
This is crazy.

536
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:56,090
?祝我?
?Happy birthday?

537
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,510
?生日?
?To?

538
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,670
?快乐?
?Me?

539
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:08,230
?祝麦克斯生日快乐?
?Happy birthday, dear Max?

540
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:13,690
?祝我?
?Happy birthday?

541
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,250
?生日快乐?
?To me?

542
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,280
啊
Ah...

543
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:52,200
{\i1}系统恢复运行
{\i1}System restored.

544
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,980
{\i1}愿你今天过得愉快
{\i1}Have a nice day.

545
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,490
哈利
Harry,

546
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,870
奥斯公司因为此前
Oscorp's been under intense public scrutiny

547
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:00,290
康纳斯教授的信任危机
in the wake of Dr. Connors' recent, uh,

548
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:01,630
而饱受质疑
breach of trust.

549
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,210
你是说  公众被惹毛了
You mean people are pissed off

550
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:06,540
因为他想要将纽约市所有人都变成巨型蜥蜴
because he tried to turn everyone in New York City into giant lizards.

551
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,880
正因如此
Given that,

552
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:13,550
所有他参与的生物杂交项目都叫停了
all the animal hybrid programs he was involved in were destroyed

553
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,060
以此来重拾投资者的信心
to restore investor confidence.

554
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:19,890
典型的奥斯本风格
Ah. That is the Osborn way.

555
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,820
害群之马  除之后快  对吧
Whatever's inconvenient around here, just get rid of it, right?

556
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,640
你现在正处在风口浪尖
Much of that scrutiny may fall on you now.

557
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,860
我们认为你最好的选择就是给公众一个合理的推诿
We felt that plausible deniability was your best option.

558
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,020
当然  我懂的
Sure, sure. I get it.

559
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,450
一个20岁的小毛孩
Twenty-year-old kid.

560
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,290
掌管2000亿的公司
Two hundred billion dollar company.

561
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,280
这当爹的是怎么想的
What was Dad thinking?

562
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,030
你们都是律师对吧
I mean, you're all lawyers, right?

563
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:47,550
肯定有人质疑过我父亲在弥留之际是否神志不清
Surely, someone must've questioned his sanity in the end.

564
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:50,930
也肯定有人想过要让他的遗嘱失去法律效力
Someone must've thought about having him declared legally incompetent.

565
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:53,390
这样就能使这次谈话变简单了
It would've made this conversation a lot easier.

566
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:56,090
-哈利  -是奥斯本先生
- Harry... - It's Mr. Osborn.

567
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,460
我们不是朋友
We're not friends.

568
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,180
你好
Hi.

569
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,940
你是他的助理  对吧
You were his assistant, right?

570
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,400
是的
Mm-hm.

571
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,900
你叫什么
What's your name?

572
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,660
菲莉西亚
Felicia.

573
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,240
菲莉西亚
Felicia.

574
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,920
从现在开始
From now on,

575
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,120
在座的所有人都得为菲莉西亚工作
everybody at this table works for Felicia

576
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:30,910
因为菲莉西亚听命于我
because Felicia works for me.

577
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,250
有谁有什么异议吗
Would anybody like to speak up?

578
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:39,880
没有就好  这样你们就暂时保住了饭碗
Well, good. Then you can all keep your jobs a little longer.

579
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,510
先生  有个叫彼得・帕克的想要见你
Sir, there's a Peter Parker here to see you.

580
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,940
菲莉西亚  我要看到这张列表里的所有文件
Felicia, I wanna see every file on this list.

581
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,190
每一份都要
Every single one.

582
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,240
彼得・帕克
Peter Parker.

583
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,620
我不是在做梦吧
It's like seeing a ghost.

584
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,120
嘿  哈利
Hey, Harry.

585
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,170
好久不见
Random.

586
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:19,000
-十年了吧  -八年
- What, 10 years. - It's eight.

587
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,590
也快十年了
Close.

588
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:23,920
找我什么事
What's up?

589
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,260
我看到新闻了
I saw the news, man.

590
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,570
我听说你爸爸的事了  所以...
I heard about your dad and I wanted to come and...

591
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:33,970
我想过来看看你  看看你过得怎么样
Just wanted to come and see you. Check to see how you were doing.

592
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,720
还有人在等我
I'm with some people.

593
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,480

我在开会
I'm in a meeting.

595
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,960
对不起  我无意打扰
I'm sorry, I don't wanna intrude.

596
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,830
我知道我们很久不见了
I know it's been a long time.

597
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:50,000
我理解你现在的心情
I kind of know exactly what you're going through right now.

598
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
我父母离开的时候  你一直陪在我的身边
And you were so there for me when my parents...

599
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,330
所以我现在过来看你
Well, that's why I'm here for you.

600
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,160
多谢
Thank you.

601
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,250
很高兴见到你
Ah, it's good to see you, man.

602
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,960
很高兴见到你
It's good to see you.

603
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,760
你父亲的事我很遗憾
I'm sorry about your dad.

604
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,890
你把牙套摘了
You got your braces off.

605
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:21,080
这样你的一字眉就更加瞩目了
Now there's nothing to distract from your unibrow.

606
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,150
就是这样
There he is.

607
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,880
-这才是我认识的你  -哈哈
- There he is. - Ha-ha-ha.

608
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,000
你还是会在每天早上吹干头发吗
You still blow-dry your hair every morning?

609
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,970
你知道的  我的一个仆人拿着吹风机
Um... You know, one of my manservants holds the hair dryer

610
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:38,010
-但是我自己梳头好吧  -哈哈
- but I work the comb, okay? - Ha-ha-ha.

611
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:42,260
至少我的生活还不是完全不能自理
So at least I'm not completely helpless.

612
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,670
你个笨蛋
You're stupid.

613
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:53,400
毕业之后我去了巴西  然后是新加坡
After graduation, I went to Brazil, then Singapore.

614
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,650
-这样啊  -是的

615
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,690
然后是欧洲  我去了欧洲
And then Europe. You know, I went to Europe.

616
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,220
我见过你
I saw you.

617
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,240
什么叫你见过我
What do you mean, you saw me?

618
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,620
我在一些杂志上看到你和一些法国名模
I saw you in some magazine with some French supermodel.

619
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,620
你懂我在说什么的
You know what I'm talking about?

620
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,540
-是的  我懂  哈哈  -哈哈
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ha-ha-ha. - Ha-ha-ha.

621
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,540
哥们  和模特在一起让我筋疲力尽
Dude, that whole model thing is so exhausting.

622
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,080
我懂的
I know.

623
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:16,910
怎么  你有女朋友了吗
What? You got a lady?

624
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,540
额...
Uh...

625
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,250
这还真是个问题
That's a question.

626
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,640
你可问倒我了
That's a question.

627
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,290
兄弟
Whoa, buddy.

628
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,890
不  我没有
No, I don't.

629
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,050
有
Yeah.

630
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,520
我也不知道怎么说  这事...
I don't know. It's, uh...

631
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,740
我也说不清  一言难尽
I don't know. It's complicated.

632
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,980
我从不把事情复杂化
Yeah, I don't do complicated.

633
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,790
她是谁  她叫什么
Uh, what's her name? Who is she?

634
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,290
她叫格温
Her name's Gwen.

635
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,240
格温・史黛西
Gwen Stacy.

636
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,580
-格温・史黛西  -她是你的员工
- Gwen Stacy. - She works for you.

637
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,290
真的吗  她是我的员工
Really? She works for me?

638
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,880
-她在奥斯公司半工半读  -她是模范员工吗
- She does work-study at Oscorp. - Is she a model employee?

639
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,050
我父亲把我送走的时候
You know, when my father sent me away

640
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:06,330
我试图忘却这里的一切
I tried to forget everything about this place.

641
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,750
其中也包括你
I guess that kind of included you.

642
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,380
你不必向我解释什么  兄弟
You ain't gotta explain anything to me, man.

643
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,680
我们都是被遗弃的人
We both got dumped.

644
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:25,680
你弄明白为什么你父母一走了之了吗
You ever figure out why your parents bailed?

645
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:31,440
我爸爸留下个公文包
My dad left a briefcase.

646
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,290
我就只有这个  一个装满垃圾的公文包
That's all I got, briefcase full of junk.

647
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:36,880
无所谓了  我也不知道  我尽可能的不去想他
Whatever. I don't know. I try not to think about it.

648
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,030
效果如何
How's that working out for you?

649
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,070
很好
Perfectly.

650
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,460
哥们  好臂力
Dude. Nice arm.

651
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:52,310
只是手腕功夫罢了  关键都在手腕
It's just the wrist. It's just all in the wrist, buddy.

652
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:54,690
只要你掌握了诀窍  你也能做到的
You could do it too if you just strengthened up that.

653
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,310
好吧
Yeah, right.

654
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,060
你不得不承认  这城市变得还挺疯狂
You gotta admit, though. Things have gotten crazy around here, man.

655
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,400
巨型蜥蜴
Giant lizards

656
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,890
蜘蛛人们
and spider guys.

657
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,660
就一个人  就一个蜘蛛侠
Just one guy. Just one spider man.

658
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:13,360
或者是蜘蛛女侠  我们也不清楚
Or woman. We don't know for sure.

659
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:17,700
管他呢  他穿着个紧身衣到处去救树上的小猫
Whatever, dude. He wears spandex to rescue kittens from trees.

660
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,880
真令人大开眼界
I'm so impressed.

661
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,370
我觉得他带给人们希望
I kind of like to think he gives people hope.

662
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,090
什么希望
For what?

663
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:27,050
最终一切都会好起来的
Maybe eventually everything's gonna be all right.

664
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:29,680
但愿我能等到那最终
Yeah, I just wish I had time for "eventually."

665
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,020
他是谁
Who was he?

666
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,170
麦克斯・狄龙  电气工程师
Maxwell Dillon. Electrical engineer.

667
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:41,070
无亲无故的
No associates or friends to speak of.

668
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:44,610
他提交的电网设计被我们据为己有了
He submitted specs for the grid that we appropriated.

669
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:46,140
这人完全
The guy was

670
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:48,100
默默无闻
invisible.

671
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:52,940
因为哈利这孩子的掌权  华尔街那群人已经够紧张了
Wall Street's nervous enough with that child, Harry, taking over.

672
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,190
我们必须想办法把他赶出公司
We've gotta find a way to get him out.

673
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:58,460
要是这时候被媒体知道这次事故
In the meantime, if the press gets hold of this accident,

674
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:59,920
我们的股价就会暴跌
our stock will crater.

675
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,170
所以必须确保这位狄龙先生继续默默无闻下去
So make sure this Mr. Dillon stays invisible.

676
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,790
这个在将来也许能派上用场
This could prove useful for us in the future.

677
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,020
嘿
Hey.

678
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,510
?有人说爱情?
?Some say love?

679

{\an8}Song For Zula(祖拉之歌) ---By Phosphorescent

680
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,730
?是炽热的?
?Is a burning thing?

681
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,900
白痴  给我滚开
Hey, moron! Get out of the street!

682
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,850
?它像一个火焰环?
?That it makes a fiery ring?

683
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,900
?哦  但我认为爱情?
?Oh, but I know love?

684
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,310
?是逐渐凋零的?
?as a fading thing?

685
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:58,540
?就像变化无常的一根羽毛  川流不息?
?Just as fickle as a feather in a stream?

686
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:01,040
嘿  你好
Hey. Hi.

687
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,830
?我看见爱情?
?I saw love?

688
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:04,280
你好
Hi.

689
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,630
你真美
You look amazing.

690
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,670
?它贴着我的脸庞?
?It put its face up to my face?

691
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:12,340
抱歉这么一时兴起把你约出来
I'm sorry for the spontaneous outreach. It was kind of...

692
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:15,210
不  我不介意  这样的一时兴起
No. I don't... I... Spontaneous...

693
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,430
我觉得挺好
is all right. You know.

694
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:20,300
我觉得是时候了
Well, I just figured it was time.

695
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:22,480
你知道的
You know?

696
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,800
是时候重新成为好朋友了
Time that we try to be friends.

697
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:31,560
朋友  真是...
Friends, yeah. That's...

698
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,530
太好了
great.

699
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:36,030
我不想我们的关系太过复杂
I just don't want us to be complicated.

700
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:38,610
我今天刚和人说过  我讨厌复杂
I was just saying that to someone. I hate complicated.

701
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,440
保持简单
Keep it simple.

702
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:44,250
好  好极了  没问题
Okay, great, great. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.

703
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:45,900
但是我想...
Well, I mean...

704
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:52,880
如果我们要做朋友的话  我们必须约法三章
Ha, ha. If we're gonna be friends, I think we gotta establish some ground rules.

705
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,050
-约法三章  -是的  约法三章
- Some ground rules? - Yeah, some ground rules.

706
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:57,010
-呵呵  -比如这个
- Heh, heh. Heh. - Like that.

707
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:58,630
比如什么
Like what?

708
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,980
-这种笑容  -怎么了
- That laugh. That laugh. - What?

709
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,770
以后不许这么笑了
That's off the table.

710
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:05,810
-我不能这么笑了?  -不能了
- My laugh is off the table? - Off the table.

711
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:08,110
你得笑得更讨人厌点
You gotta figure out a more annoying laugh.

712
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,600
这笑容还是很迷人
That's still adorable.

713
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:15,200
才不迷人呢
That was not adorable.

714
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,660
不  这才不迷人呢
No, it's not adorable.

715
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,580
-好了  我想到一条  -好的
- Okay. I have a ground rule. Um... - Oh, good.

716
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,370
-是什么  -额
- What is it? - Uh...

717
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:24,120
不准用你迷人的大眼睛看着我
Don't tell me that I look amazing

718
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,410
然后和我说我很美  好吗
with your big brown doe eyes. Okay?

719
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,460
这点我是很认真的
I'm really serious about that one.

720
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,510
-哦不  -怎么了
- Oh, no. - What?

721
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:36,590
我又想要一条
I just figured out the next ground rule.

722
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:37,970
是什么
What?

723
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:39,720
以后不准再这样
No more of this.

724
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,970
不准再这样揉鼻子
No more of this little nose rub that you do.

725
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,770
-这样吗  -不要以为我没有...
- This? - Don't think I haven't... Hey.

726
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,730
那我该怎么办  现在这季节容易过敏
What am I supposed to do? It's allergy season.

727
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,400
我受不了了
This is killing me.

728
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,150
你当面践踏我的基本原则  我要走了
You're just spitting in the face of my ground rules. I'm out.

729
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:52,800
拜托
Come on. Heh.

730
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:56,810
我们先去买个冰激凌  然后我再走
First we get ice cream, and then I'm out.

731
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,740
对  所以我那么做了
Um, yeah. So I did that.

732
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:41,870
此后我就彻底迷上了这个卖韩国肉丸的地方
And I got completely addicted to this place that has Korean meatballs.

733
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:44,790
-我知道  -你去过吗  那里超赞
- Yeah. No, I know. - Have you been there? It's mind-blowing.

734
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:47,410
那地方在第六大道  我知道你很爱那
That place on 6th. I know. You love it there.

735
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:52,040
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

736
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:56,910
你怎么知道我爱那家店
How do you know I love it there?

737
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:58,880
因为
Because, um...

738
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:02,750
因为你跟我说过
Because you told me.

739
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,050
那家店上个月才开张
It just opened last month.

740
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,630
你在跟踪我吗
Have you been following me?

741
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,470
我就知道
I knew it.

742
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,350
有多频繁
How often?

743
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,290
有时候
Just once a day.

744
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:29,030
一天一次
Sometimes.

745
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,120
有的时候更多
Sometimes more.

746
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,220
哦  天呐
Oh, boy.

747
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,740
为什么
Why?

748
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:46,840
确保我的安全吗
Make sure I'm safe?

749
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:49,390
-还有  -还有什么
- And... - And what?

750
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:53,220
因为这也是我能接近你的唯一方法了
And because it's the closest I can get to still being with you.

751
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:07,570
我要搬去英国了
I'm moving to England.

752
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:17,200
什么
What?

In molecular medicine. And it's between me and this other kid.

756
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:29,430
我们要进行一场面试
There's this oral exam that we have to do

757
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:32,440
他好像是个大学新生  但他只有14岁
and he's, like, a freshman in college, but he's 14.

758
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,560
可能是他得到奖学金
And... And it's... it could be him.

759
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,610
也可能是我  我希望是我获得
But it might be me. I hope it's me.

760
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:40,310
如果那样的话  我就要搬去英国了
And I'm thinking that I'll be moving to England.

761
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,520
我真的好兴奋
And I'm really excited.

762
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:48,270
这真是...
That's, uh...

00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,860
英国
England.

764
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,030
怎么了
What?

765
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:55,310
总部  请求支援
Station, I need a 10-85.

766
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:58,730
派些巡逻车到杜菲广场南边来
Send out additional units to the south-end corner of Duffy Square.

767
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:03,220
大家都退后  都退后
Everybody get out of the way! Get out of the way!

768
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:07,100
先生  马上把手从电缆上拿开

771
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:15,370
站在原地别动
You stay right where you are!

772
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:16,830
别动
Do not move!

773
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:19,360
站住  趴下  趴在地上
Freeze! Get down! On the ground!

774
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:38,730
马上给我趴到地上
Get down on the ground, now!

马上趴在地上
Get your ass down on the ground! Now!

777
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:43,570

780
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:50,530
为了你和其他人员的安全起见
For your own safety and the safety of the other patrons in this area.

781
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:54,610
我的天呐
Oh, my gosh.

782
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:58,660
他们在看我  他们在看我
They see me. You see me.

783

They see me.

It's not my fault!

789
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,350
我说了住手

790
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:38,070
幸好你不是那些骑着马的警察
I'm glad you're not one of those cops that rides a horse.

791
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,710

你不记得我了吗
You don't remember me?

799
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,060
是的  我应该记住吗
No. Should I?

800
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:16,950
我走在大街上  一辆车差点撞上我  你一把抱住我
I walked into the street. The car almost hit me. You swooped me up.

801
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:18,620

你还说你需要我
You said you needed me.

<i>You're not invincible.</i>

939
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:16,590
我们需要一个更大容量的电池
We're gonna need a bigger battery.

Pursuit Of Happiness ---By Kid Cudi

941
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,670
-喂  -彼得
- Hello. - Pete.

942
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:01,510
是我
It's me.

943
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:03,510
嘿  哈利  什么...
Hey, Harry. What...?

944
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:06,290
现在几点了
What time is it?

945
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:10,340
晚上  又或是早上  我不清楚  我一宿没睡
Uh, late, early, I don't know. I've been up all night.

946
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,900
我必须见你一面
I need to see you.

947
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:13,360
你还好吧
You all right?

948
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,140
不太好  彼得
Not really, Pete.

949
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:16,690
我快死了
I'm dying.

950
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,850
但我想你能救我一命
But I think you can help save my life.

951
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:25,290
<i>你眼前看到的是世界首个人与蜘蛛的杂交体</i>
<i>You're looking at the world's first human-spider hybrids.</i>

952
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:28,410
<i>我们希望能从它们的腺体中提取出毒素</i>
<i>The hope is to extract the venom from their glands</i>

953
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:31,080
<i>将其转变为解药</i>
<i>and turn that into a cure.</i>

954
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:33,920
<i>一种能够治愈病变细胞的解药</i>
<i>An agent that heals diseased cells.</i>

955
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:39,300
<i>如果我能被治愈  想象一下这能给疾病治疗带来什么影响</i>
<i>And if I can be cured, imagine what this could do for other diseases</i>

956
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,800
<i>例如老年痴呆症  甚至是癌症</i>
<i>like Alzheimer's, even cancer.</i>

957
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:48,310
他们从来没有进行人体试验
They never made it to human trials.

958
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:52,340
14年的苦心研究  却一无所获
It's 14 years of research, and nothing to show for it.

959
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:56,810
除了这个
Except maybe this.

960
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,440
蜘蛛侠
Spider-Man.

961
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,690
他怎么了
What about him?

962
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,360
他被其中一只蜘蛛咬到  并且成功转化
He was bitten by one of those things, and it worked.

963
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:16,610
我不知道他怎么做到的  也不知道为什么
I don't know how and I don't know why,

964
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,340
但是他拥有了蜘蛛的所有能力
but he can do everything else a spider can,

965
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:22,840
包括自我治愈
including self-heal.

966
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:24,840
我必须找到他
I need to find him.

967
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:27,220
我需要他的血
I need his blood.

968
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,100
你需要
You need...

969
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:47,360
蜘蛛侠的血
Spider-Man's blood?

970
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,990
这能救我一命
It'll save my life.

971
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:55,330
也可能不行  哈利
It may not, Harry.

972
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:57,750
这事没那么简单
It may not be that simple.

973
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,760
你是知道发生在科特・康纳斯的事的
You saw what happened to Curt Connors, right?

974
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,160
康纳斯太弱了
Connors was weak.

975
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:03,510
这次是我  彼得
This is me, Peter.

976
01:07:03,510 --> 01:07:06,000
你总不能开着辆献血车
I don't think you can just set up a van

977
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,010
就让他无偿献血吧
and have him donate.

978
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:13,480
我想他对让别人拿着个针筒抽他血的事情很敏感的
I mean, I'm sure he's sensitive about people shoving needles and...

979
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:15,010
额  他敏感  好吧
Ah, he's sensitive, okay.

980
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:20,110
那你何不敏感的告诉我他在哪
Well, then, maybe you could just sensitively tell me where he is,

981
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:22,810
我自己去找他
and I will go ask him myself.

982
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:24,310
什么
What?

983
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:28,920
{\an8}摄影: 彼得・帕克

984
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:29,320
-你拍了他的照片  -所以呢
- You took his picture. - So?

985
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:31,410
-你认识他  -哈利
- You know him. - Harry.

986
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:34,960
我是远距离拍摄的  我用了长焦距透镜
I took a picture from a long way away. I used a long lens.

987
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,580
我不认识他
I don't know him.

988
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:41,370
结合你那天在河边说的
I put together what you said at the river.

989
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:45,660
你说他带给人希望
About how he gives people hope.

990
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:49,080
拜托
Come on.

答应我
Just say yes.

999
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:19,240
不要背对着我
Don't turn your back on me!

1000
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:23,040
我不想落得我父亲那样的下场  彼得
I don't wanna end up like my father, Peter.

1001
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:26,160
求你了
Please.

1002
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:29,220
彼得  求你了
Peter, please.

1003
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:31,000
我不能
I can't.

1004
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,050
求你了
Please.

1005
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,560
我会试着
I'm gonna try

1006
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:45,060
找到蜘蛛侠
and find Spider-Man.

1007
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,710
嘿  保安来这干吗
Hey, what's security doing over here?

1008
01:08:56,710 --> 01:08:57,960
好奇怪
That's so weird.

1009
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,230
她就在那
She's right over there.

1010
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:08,130
嘿  史黛西小姐
Hey! Miss Stacy!

1011
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:25,230
嗨
Hi.

1012
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,820
嗨
Hi.

1013
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:28,520
你来这干吗
What are you doing here?

1014
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:30,680
-那你在这干吗  -哦
- What are you doing here? - Oh...

1015
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,650
过来
Come here.

1016
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,130
她不在这  去其他地方看看
She's not here. Check another floor.

1017
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:43,920
-好的  -遵命  长官
- Got it. - Yes, sir!

1018
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,210
你惹麻烦了吗
You're in trouble.

1019
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:46,630
-是的  -那人是谁
- Yeah. - Who's that guy?

1020
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:49,630
奥斯公司的遗传实验室出了起事故  他们想要掩盖真相
There was an accident in the genomics lab, and they're covering it up.

1021
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:53,140
还有昨晚在时代广场的那人
And I found out. That guy from Times Square last night?

1022
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:56,560
我见过他  他是奥斯公司的电气工程师
I met him. He was an electrical engineer in the building.

1023
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,770
他可喜欢蜘蛛侠了  就像个狂热粉丝
And he loved Spider-Man, by the way. He was, like, a fanatic.

1024
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:03,650
我没感受到他的爱意  我只感受到了他想要电死我
I didn't get love vibes. I got more of a "want to kill me with his electricity" vibe.

1025
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:06,100
这正是表达爱意的一种方式嘛
That's actually kind of what it's like to love you.

1026
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:10,240
我在电脑上找他的资料  但与他相关的所有信息都被清除了
I was searching for him in the computer and all the files were erased.

1027
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,740
-天呐  -全都人间蒸发了
- My God. - He's completely erased.

1028
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:13,160
典型的奥斯本风格
That's Oscorp.

1029
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:15,370
那你呢  你怎么来这了
And what about you? Why are you here?

1030
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:16,620
哈利
Harry.

1031
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:18,490
-奥斯本吗  -他快死了
- Osborn? - He's dying.

1032
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:20,120
-你什么意思  -他快死了
- What do you mean? - He's dying.

1033
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,920
而他觉得唯一能救他的是
And he thinks the only thing that's gonna save his life

1034
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,710
我的血  蜘蛛侠的血
is my blood, is Spider-Man's blood.

1035
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:28,420
但是据我所知  如果我给了他  只会害了他
And as far as I know, if I give it to him, it could kill him.

1036
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:30,620
或者更糟
Or something worse.

1037
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,260
我知道
I know.

1038
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:35,130
这是保洁储物间  格温
This is the maintenance closet, Gwen.

1039
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:38,390
真是个老掉牙的藏身之处
This is the most cliche hiding place you could've chosen.

1040
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:40,600
-躲在这简直蠢爆了  -抱歉
- This is the stupidest hiding place. - I'm sorry,

1041
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:44,810
我没能带我们逃到巴哈马群岛去
I didn't take us to the Bahamas of hiding places.

1042
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:48,970
听着  我们得谈谈英国的事  因为我不想...
I gotta talk to you about England, I guess, because I don't...

1043
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:01,780
-你刚刚吻了我  -是的  对不起  我情不自禁就吻了
- You just kissed me. - I know, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

1044
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:03,820
你感觉怎么样
How'd you like it?

1045
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,500
感觉有点匆忙
It felt a little bit rushed.

1046
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:08,030
我知道  我知道
I know. I know, I know.

1047
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:11,880
这样吧  我来引开他们  你趁机坐电梯下去
This is the plan. You get to the elevator. I'm gonna distract him, okay?

1048
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,010
好的
Okay.

1049
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:29,690
-哦  天呐  该死的  -我太...
- Ooh! God! Damn it! - I'm so...

1050
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:33,150
我刚把热咖啡洒在你身上  我不是有意要这样做  哦不
I just spilled a hot latte all over your... I didn't mean to do that. Oh, no!

1051
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:35,240
你也是吗  抱歉
And you too? I'm sorry.

1052
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,990
-小姐  站那别动  -先生
- Miss! Stay right there! - Sir.

1053
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:39,490
-站那...  -等等
- Just stay right... - Wait, wait, wait.

1054
01:11:39,490 --> 01:11:40,900
嘿  别跑
Hey! Stop!

1055
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,210
好了  你走吧
All right. On your way.

1056
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:46,860
对不起  我今天笨手笨脚的
I'm sorry. I'm all thumbs today.

1057
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,830
-格温・史黛西  -天呐
- Gwen Stacy. Ha, ha. - Oh, my God.

1058
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:55,930
-不好意思  -不好意思
- Sorry. - Sorry.

1059
01:11:55,930 --> 01:11:57,670
没关系
No, it's okay.

1060
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:00,840
额  我是哈利
Uh, I'm... I'm Harry.

1061
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:02,540
恩
Yeah.

1062
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:06,770
-我是彼得的老朋友了  -我知道你是谁  抱歉
- I'm an old friend of Peter's. - Yeah, I know who you are. Sorry.

1063
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:08,650
刚刚有点冒失
I was kind of rushing.

1064
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:11,320
没事  很抱歉他没介绍我们认识
No, I'm sorry he never introduced us.

1065
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,810
我还以为你们两个分手了
I thought you two had broken up.

1066
01:12:14,150 --> 01:12:15,680
哦
Oh.

1067
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,870
是的  我们的确分手了
Yeah. Yes, we had.

1068
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:20,660
这事
And it's...

1069
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:22,790
-一言难尽  -复杂  我懂得
- It's complicated. - Complicated. Yeah.

1070
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:26,250
彼得就是这样  和他有关的事情都会变得复杂
I mean, it's Peter. Heh. Everything's always complicated with Peter.

1071
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:27,650
是
Yeah.

1072
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:29,450
是
Yeah.

1073
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:31,620
你说得对
Yeah, you're right.

1074
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,760
但这正是他需要你的原因
But that's why he needs you.

1075
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:36,790
不是吗
Right?

1076
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:41,460
帮助他选择该走的路
To help him make his choices clear.

1077
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:46,140
很高兴见到你  哈利
Nice to meet you, Harry.

1078
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:49,550
是啊  很高兴见到你  格温
Yeah, it's such a pleasure, Gwen.

1079
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:05,080
瑞文史考夫特机构

1080
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,490
你经历了一起可怕的事故
You've been in a terrible accident.

1081
01:13:49,370 --> 01:13:51,740
我是卡夫卡医生
I'm Dr.Kafka.

1082
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,300
我是来这帮你的
I'm here to help you.

1083
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,290
当然是了  医生
Course you are, doc.

1084
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:01,420
所以你才准备军用级别的生物刺激电极
That's why you're preparing military-grade biostim electrodes.

1085
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,000
高强度电容器
High-intensity capacitors.

1086
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,460
由奥斯公司制造的
The kind they make at Oscorp.

1087
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,480
所有的这一切都是为了帮我
All of this because you're trying to help me.

1088
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,020
你说得对
You are correct.

1089
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:13,230
我是来这研究你的
I'm here to study you.

1090
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:18,150
查明你是什么以及因何而生
To understand what you are, why you are.

1091
01:14:18,150 --> 01:14:20,430
我会得到答案的
And I will get results.

1092
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:26,870
我从未失手
I always do.

1093
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:31,820
你应该意识到
You do realize

1094
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,240
你关我的这所监狱
you locked me in a prison

1095
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:38,070
是由电力驱动的吧
that runs on electricity?

1096
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:43,180
我能感觉到它们在我的身体里
Mm. I can feel it in the walls.

1097
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:45,460
在我的血管中跳动
I can feel it in my veins.

1098
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:49,010
无论你用什么办法都无法控制它们
No matter what you do, doc, you can't contain it.

1099
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,590
这就是自然的力量
It's a force of nature.

1100
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:54,260
就像我
Like me.

1101
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,200
你想知道我有多强大
You wanna know how powerful I am?

1102
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,570
我也想知道
Well, so do I.

1103
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:13,530
我太想知道了
I'm dying to know,

1104
01:15:13,830 --> 01:15:15,360
医生
doc.

1105
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:18,960
但你最好确饱这次你能杀死我
But you better make damn sure you kill me this time.

1106
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,870
因为如果你不能的话
Because if you don't,

1107
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:23,510
我会吞噬一切光亮
I'm gonna kill the light.

1108
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:28,260
让这个城市的每一个人都体会到活在我的世界中的感觉
So everyone in this city is gonna know how it feels to live in my world.

1109
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:30,810
一个没有电能
A world without power.

1110
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:33,590
没有仁慈
A world without mercy.

1111
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,230
没有
A world

1112
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,260
蜘蛛侠的世界
without Spider-Man.

1113
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:42,060
所有人都将目睹真正的我
And everyone will be able to see me for who I truly am.

1114
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,720
你是谁
And who are you?

1115
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:46,730
你不知道吗
Don't you know?

1116
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:48,610
我是电光人
I'm Electro.

1117
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:57,000
<i>警告  已达到电力最大负载</i>
<i>Warning: Electrical restraint capacity reached.</i>

1118
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
<i>立即启动禁闭程序</i>
<i>Initiate lockdown procedure immediately.</i>

1119
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:02,030
真叫我大开眼界
Very impressive,

1120
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:04,660
电光人
Electro.

1121
01:16:05,010 --> 01:16:07,290
<i>开始封锁</i>
<i>Lockdown initiated.</i>

1122
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:19,900
梅婶
Aunt May?

1123
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,520
梅婶
Aunt May?

1124
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:28,270
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

1125
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,150
你什么时候做的
When did you do this?

1126
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:42,130
你有事瞒着我  梅婶
There's something you're not telling me, Aunt May.

1127
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:45,530
每当我提及父母的时候  你就不敢直视我
Every time I mention my parents, your eyes go down.

1128
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,930
我知道你有事瞒着我  你在骗我  我知道你爱我
I know you're not telling me something. You lie to me. I know you love me.

1129
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:51,010
-我没有撒谎  -我知道你爱我  但你的确有事瞒着我
- I don't lie. - I know you love me, but you do.

1130
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:52,790
梅婶  梅婶
Aunt May, Aunt May.

1131
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:55,590
你必须告诉我  梅婶
You have to tell me, May.

1132
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:57,640
他是我的父亲
That's my father.

1133
01:16:57,650 --> 01:16:59,310
是  他是你的父亲
Yes, he was your father.

1134
01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:02,340
但那并没能阻止他的离去
But that didn't seem to stop him from leaving you...

1135
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:04,220
把你扔在这里
here.

1136
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:07,360
我需要知道真相
I need the truth.

1137
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:11,990
真相就是你父母把你扔在我们家门口
The truth is, your parents left you here, on our doorstep.

1138
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:13,990
从此你的生活
You were this little boy whose whole world

1139
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,960
就毫无征兆地天翻地覆了
was turned upside down with no explanation.

1140
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:22,110
我们不遗余力的抚养你  你本叔和我
We did the best we could, your Uncle Ben and I.

1141
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:25,800
不然还能有谁来关心你、保护你、担心你
I mean, who else was gonna care for you, and protect you and worry about you?

1142
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,380
你的亲生父亲吗
Your father?

1143
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:28,720
不
No.

1144
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:33,100
是我从小替你擦鼻子  帮你刷牙
I was the one who wiped your nose, and made you brush your teeth,

1145
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:36,140
帮你做功课、洗脏衣服  是我
and do your homework, or washed your dirty underwear. Me!

1146
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:40,980
你没有文化的婶婶  我不知道如何维持生计
Your stupid, non-scientific aunt, who doesn't know how to make ends meet,

1147
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:42,860
只能和一群年轻人
who has to take nursing classes

1148
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:45,980
一起上护士学校  这样我才能赚够钱供你上大学
with 22-year-old kids so I can pay for you to go to college.

1149
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:48,320
没有你本叔  我不知道怎么才能做到
And I don't know how to do this without Ben.

1150
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,850
我真的不知道该怎么做
I don't know how. And...

1151
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:53,660
而你却满脑子想着你那从未出现过的
And you're dreaming about your perfect father,

1152
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:56,730
'完美的'好父亲  不
who was never here. No.

1153
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,330
不  我不会告诉你的
No, I won't tell you.

1154
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:00,670
你是我的孩子
You're my boy.

1155
01:18:00,670 --> 01:18:03,250
对我而言  你就是我的儿子
As far as I'm concerned, you're my boy.

1156
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:04,750
我不会伤害你
And I won't hurt you.

1157
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:16,090
我是你的儿子
I'm your boy.

1158
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:18,090
你是我的全部
You're my everything.

1159
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:22,650
你做得很好  足够好了
You're enough. You're more than enough.

1160
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:25,470
但这和此事无关  不要误会
That's not what this is about. Don't get that twisted.

1161
01:18:26,190 --> 01:18:29,350
-我非常的爱你  -我知道
- I love you so much. - I know.

1162
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:35,570
没事的
It's okay.

1163
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:38,030
没事的
It's okay.

1164
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:42,150
梅婶
May.

1165
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:47,450
我需要知道真相
I need to know.

1166
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,290
好吧
All right.

1167
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:58,760
我会把我知道的一切都告诉你
I'll tell you everything I know.

1168
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:03,220
但你也许会难以接受
But it will hurt you.

1169
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:05,420
没事的
Okay.

1170
01:19:07,730 --> 01:19:10,400
葬礼之后的某一天
A few days after the funeral,

1171
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:14,560
两个政府工作人员才找我们
two government men came to see us.

1172
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:19,370
他们说
They said the genetics research

1173
01:19:19,370 --> 01:19:23,080
你父亲和诺曼・奥斯本一起进行的遗传实验价值连城
that your father was doing with Norman Osborn was very valuable,

1174
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,960
外面有很多人愿意花重金购买
and that people would pay a lot for it.

1175
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,210
所以他带着东西逃跑了
And that's why he ran off with it.</i>

1176
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:30,170
他们说他是个叛徒
They said he was a traitor.</i>

1177
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:32,260
我简直不敢相信  彼得
I couldn't believe it, Peter.

1178
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:35,470
他们说他背叛了他的挚友  背叛了我们所有人
They told us he betrayed his best friend, all of us,

1179
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:37,210
就只是为了钱
for the money.

1180
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:39,590
我不明白
I don't...

1181
01:19:41,730 --> 01:19:44,270
我不信  不  我不信  这说不通
Oh, I don't get it. No, I don't... This doesn't make sense.

1182
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:48,150
是啊  我知道  我也不相信
Yes, I know. I know. I didn't believe it either. I didn't believe it.

1183
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:49,650
没道理啊
It doesn't make any sense.

1184
01:19:49,650 --> 01:19:51,270
彼得  我不知道
Peter, I don't know.

1185
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:54,570
长久以来  我在脑子里把这事过了一遍又一遍
For so long, I would play it over and over and over in my head.

1186
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:57,070
我遗漏了什么  哪里出错了
What had I missed? What had I missed?

1187
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:59,830
他不过是个平凡低调的人
He was just this normal, unassuming guy.

1188
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:03,160
一件破实验服穿了20年
He wore the same ratty lab coat for 20 years.

1189
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:06,080
他每天早上七点钟坐D号线去上班
He took the D train to work at 7 every morning.

1190
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,660
晚上六点准时回家
Came home at 6 every night.

1191
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:11,240
我不知道
I don't know.

1192
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:15,040
也许每个人都有不为人知的一面
Maybe everyone has a part of themselves they hide.

1193
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:18,580
即便是面对他们爱的人
Even from the people they love.

1194
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:25,970
彼得
Peter.

1195
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,510
彼得
Peter.

1196
01:20:34,150 --> 01:20:36,060
奥斯本先生
Mr. Osborn.

1197
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:42,240
抬头
Look up.

1198
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,980
听说你在找我
Think you're looking for me.

1199
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:49,910
我不是在做梦吧
I cannot believe my eyes.

1200
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:52,950
蜘蛛侠
Spider-Man.

1201
01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:02,250
正是我梦寐以求的人
Just the man I wanted to see.

1202
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:06,390
你
You, um...

1203
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,300
见过彼得了吗
talked to Peter?

1204
01:21:09,810 --> 01:21:11,260
是的
Yeah.

1205
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:20,560
我想要帮你的  奥斯本先生  我真的想
I wanna help you, Mr. Osborn. I really, really do.

1206
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:25,120
但我不能给你我的血  至少现在不能
I can't give you my blood. Not right now.

1207
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,650
你说什么
Excuse me?

1208
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:29,360
这太危险了
It's too dangerous.

1209
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:32,610
如果我们的血不能相容  你会死的
If our blood is incompatible, you could die.

1210
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:35,870
我已经快死了
I'm already dying.

1211
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,470
你的血总不会让我多死一遍吧
Your blood can't make me die more.

1212
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:41,470
但也可能发生更糟的事
But it could do something worse.

1213
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:45,550
好吧
Okay.

1214
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:48,770
说吧  多少钱
All right, how much?

1215
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:51,310
-什么多少钱  -你想要多少钱
- How much what? - How much do you want? Name it.

1216
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:55,530
一艘船还是一架飞机  亦或是现金  你想要多少钱
You want a boat? You want a plane? You want money? How much do you want?

1217
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:59,180
-我不想要你的钱  -得了吧  所有人都想要我的钱
- I don't want your money. - Come on. Everybody wants my money!

1218
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:01,020
我不想要
I don't.

1219
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,730
我还以为
I thought you...

1220
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,910
我还以为你是世人的救星
I thought you were supposed to save people.

1221
01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:12,460
我还以为你存在的目的就是救人性命
I thought that's what you do, is you save people's lives.

1222
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:15,000
而你却要眼睁睁的看着我死吗
You're... You're just gonna let me die.

1223
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,470
-我这是在保护你  -不  你不是
- I'm trying to protect you right now. - No. No, you are not.

1224
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:21,290
你不过是想保护你自己
You're trying to protect yourself.

1225
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:25,930
听着  我们只是需要多一点时间
Look, we just need a bit more time

1226
01:22:25,930 --> 01:22:28,010
-来找到其他的方法  -我没有时间了
- to figure out something else. - I do not have time!

1227
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:29,010
滚出去
Get out!

1228
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:36,930
对不起
I'm sorry.

1229
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:49,440
你是个骗子  蜘蛛侠
You're a fraud, Spider-Man! Unh!

1230
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:04,640
-嗨  -嗨
- Unh! Hey! Hi. - Hi.

1231
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:07,810
-我得和你谈一谈  -我现在赶时间
- Hi, I gotta talk to you for a second. - I'm running late right now.

1232
01:23:07,810 --> 01:23:10,640
-就一会  -我不能  对不起  彼得
- It's just gonna take a second. - I can't. I'm sorry, Peter.

1233
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:14,190
只要一分钟就行  我就说一件事  说完我就走
Just give me one minute. I just wanna say one thing and I'm gone.

1234
01:23:14,190 --> 01:23:16,400
-一切都乱套了  所有事都变得疯狂  -小声点
- Everything's a mess. Everything's insane. - Shh. Shh.

1235
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,860
关于我父母的事  我所了解的一切都是个谎言
My dad, my mom. Everything I thought about them? Lies.

1236
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:22,030
谎言  谎言  所有的事都颠覆了
Ha! Lies. Lies, lies, lies. Nothing makes any sense anymore.

1237
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:24,110
这就是现实  我必须弄清楚哈利的事怎么做
So here we are. I gotta figure out what I'm gonna do with Harry.

1238
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:25,820
我当然想要救他
Of course I wanna save him. You know?

1239
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:27,700
我想要救他  因为他是我最好的兄弟
I wanna save him because he's my best pal.

1240
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:30,790
如果我的血能起效呢  但如果无效呢
And what if my blood works? But what if it doesn't?

1241
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:32,500
我不知道  我真的不知道该怎么办
I don't know. I got no idea.

1242
01:23:34,170 --> 01:23:37,040
-天呐  -我头脑一片空白
- Oh, God. - I got nothing. I got nothing.

1243
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:40,010

But who am I?

1257

我是约翰・霍普金斯

哈佛大学的一个年轻教授
I'm one of the young professors at Harvard,

我正想让她

1260
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:24,840
加入我的团队
Be a part of my team for a while now.

你到底想和我说什么
What do you want to say to me?

1267
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:39,010
你只能想到什么
What's the "one thing"?

1268
01:24:42,690 --> 01:24:44,940
我必须去英国  彼得
I have to go to England, Peter.

1269
01:24:46,530 --> 01:24:48,310
这对我很重要
It's important to me.

1270
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:56,320
我也不知道  也许我们在不同轨道上吧
I mean, I don't know. Maybe we're on different paths right now.

You know? I don't know.

也许我们只能
Maybe we're just

各奔东西  我不...
going different ways. I don't...

Good luck.

1277

You all right?

有什么我能为您效劳的吗
Is there anything I can get you?

1290
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:08,870
没有  除非你能将那些蜘蛛起死回生
No, not unless you can bring those spiders back to life.

1291
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:10,420
蜘蛛
Spiders?

1292
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:12,790
就是那些被他们销毁的

"以此来重拾投资者的信心"

I think there may be another way to get what you're looking for.

I overheard Menken talking with one of our security heads.

1299
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:40,690
他们说在销毁蜘蛛之前
Before they destroyed the spiders,

1300
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:43,270
公司将毒素提取了出来
they had the venom extracted.

1301

什么
Uh, what?

1302

你说什么
What are you saying?

1303
01:27:50,630 --> 01:27:52,720
这样他们就可以既遵守法庭的判决
That way, they could comply with the lawsuits,

1304
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:55,960
又能保留实验数据以备不时之需

-我要进入特殊...  -你还有胆回来
- I want in to Special... - How dare you come back in here?

1474
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:41,190
你个目中无人、一文不值、乳臭未干
You recalcitrant, unworthy, defective,

1475
01:40:41,190 --> 01:40:43,560
的丧家之犬
urchin freaks.

1476
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:51,320
抱歉  这不是我们想听的回答
Oh, God, I'm sorry. That's just not the answer we were looking for.

1477
01:41:04,550 --> 01:41:06,000
离手
Clear.

1478
01:41:07,430 --> 01:41:10,380
欢迎回到加分环节
Welcome back to the bonus round.

1479
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:15,290
我们去散个步吧  如何
Hey, let's take a walk, shall we?

1480
01:41:19,230 --> 01:41:22,270
电网就随你处置了
The grid is all yours.

1481
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:57,180
蜘蛛的毒素  拿出来给我

没有用的
It won't work.

1486
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:30,930
除了人体试验外  我们所有的测试都做过了
We ran every diagnostic test apart from human trials.

1487
01:42:30,930 --> 01:42:35,300
已经有人做过人体试验了  只是你太蠢不知道罢了
You've actually already run human trials. You're just too stupid to know it.

1488
01:42:38,940 --> 01:42:41,380
快注射
Do it. Now.

1489
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:02,710
解药一直就在你这
You had it all this time.

1490
01:44:19,930 --> 01:44:20,680
检测到致命伤

1491
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:21,040

麻烦停车
Stop the cab.

1496

小姐  我正停着呢
Lady, I ain't even moving.

1497
01:44:52,180 --> 01:44:55,130
我爱你

1498
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:02,170

- The message right there. - Oh, that. That was you?

1503
01:45:20,890 --> 01:45:22,930
-别装了  -我没认出来
- Don't do that. - I couldn't make it out.

1504
01:45:22,930 --> 01:45:25,460
那我告诉你写着什么  那写着"我爱你"
I'll tell you what it says. Says, "I love you."

1505
01:45:26,730 --> 01:45:28,850
因为我爱你
Because I love you.

1506
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:32,150
-无意冒犯  但是你错了  -我哪里错了
- And no offense, but you're wrong. - I'm wrong about what?

1507
01:45:32,150 --> 01:45:34,230
你说我们走在不同的轨道上
You're wrong about us being on different paths.

1508
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:36,980
我们不在不同的轨道  你就是我的轨道
We're not on different paths. You're my path.

1509
01:45:37,660 --> 01:45:40,230
你永远都会是我要走的路
And you're always gonna be my path.

1510
01:45:40,780 --> 01:45:44,660
我知道这世上有太多我们不能在一起的理由  我知道
And I know there's a million reasons why we shouldn't be together. I know that.

1511
01:45:44,660 --> 01:45:46,740
但我受够了
But I'm tired of them.

1512
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:51,660
我哪个都不想听
I'm tired of every single one of them.

1513
01:45:51,750 --> 01:45:54,080
我们都得做出选择
We've all gotta make a choice.

1514
01:45:55,590 --> 01:45:57,460
对吗  那好  我选择你
Right? Well, I choose you.

1515

我是
So

1516
01:46:01,180 --> 01:46:03,130
这么想的
here's my thought.

1517
01:46:04,350 --> 01:46:06,090
英国
England.

1518
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:08,760
我们两都去
Both of us.

1519
01:46:10,230 --> 01:46:12,220
我现在跟定你了
I'm following you now.

1520
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:14,600
你走到哪我都要跟着你
I'm just gonna follow you everywhere.

1521
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:17,140
我这辈子跟定你了
I'm just gonna follow you the rest of my life.

1522
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:21,370
我想英国那也有犯罪
I mean, they got crime there in England.

1523
01:46:21,370 --> 01:46:23,280
-是的  -他们有一大堆罪犯
- Yeah. - They got tons of crime, it seems.

1524
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:25,610
-很多  -他们有...
- Tons. - They got, uh,

1525
01:46:25,870 --> 01:46:28,250
-开膛手杰克  -呵呵
- Jack the Ripper. - Heh, heh.

1526
01:46:25,870 --> 01:46:28,250
{\an8}开膛手杰克：1888年英国伦敦系列凶杀案的凶犯  欧美文化中最恶名昭彰的杀手之一

1527
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:29,500
怎么了
What?

1528
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:32,250
他们还没将开膛手杰克缉捕归案  你不知道吗
They haven't caught Jack the Ripper yet. You didn't know that?

1529
01:46:52,110 --> 01:46:53,680
这是什么情况
What the hell is that?

1530
01:47:03,910 --> 01:47:05,860
那是麦克斯吗
Is that Max?

1531
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:08,690
他肯定是切断了全市的电力
He must have cut the power to the whole city.

1532
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:18,960
PNA322  你在...
PNA 322, you are...

1534
01:47:21,260 --> 01:47:23,840
嘿  马上叫技术人员过来
Hey, I need Tech Ops up here right now.

1535
01:47:23,850 --> 01:47:26,720
电话坏了  谁下去把技术人员叫上来
The phones are down. Somebody go down and grab Tech Ops.

1536
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:28,770
嘿  大家把基本情况记下来
Hey, write down what you remember, people.

1537
01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:32,770
肯定会有应急措施的  对吧  备用电源之类的
There's gotta be some kind of blackout plan, right? Some kind of backup?

1538
01:47:32,770 --> 01:47:35,860
发电厂那有个重启装置
There's an emergency reset at the power plant.

1539
01:47:35,860 --> 01:47:38,940
如果他切断了输电线路  那就没法重启了
If he cuts the transmission lines, they're never gonna get this back up.

1540
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:41,860
那我该怎么阻止他  每次我靠近他  他就会烧掉我的蛛网发射器
How will I stop him? Every time I get close, he fries my web shooters.

1541
01:47:41,860 --> 01:47:44,070
-你试过给衣服接地吗  -我都试过了
- Have you tried grounding them? - Tried everything.

- Rubber, plastic... - Did you try magnetizing them?

1543
01:47:46,370 --> 01:47:49,080
我没有试过磁化它
I didn't try magnetizing them.

1544
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:51,650
好吧  还记得我们八年级上的科技课吗
Okay, well, remember 8th grade science class?

1545
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:54,940
如果你用一节电池磁化一颗钉子
If you magnetize a nail with a battery...

1546
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:57,240
-就会使钉子带电  -没错
- It holds an electric charge. - Yes.

1547
01:47:59,210 --> 01:48:02,670
纽约控制塔  这里是泛美航空273航班
New York Approach. This is Pan National 273 on approach.

1548
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:04,370

How do you hear?

1549
01:48:04,970 --> 01:48:06,550
控制塔 收到没
Approach, do you copy?

1550
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:08,920
无线电正常  不是我们的问题
Radio's working. It's not us.

1551
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:20,360
不要惊慌  所有人回到车上去
Do not panic. Everyone, please return to your vehicles.

现在看见我了吗  蜘蛛侠
Do you see me now, Spider-Man?

1583

是时候接受我们的命运了
It's time to meet our destiny.

1584
01:50:12,430 --> 01:50:15,100
控制塔  我们受到了电气干扰
Tower, we're experiencing some kind of electrical disturbance.

1585
01:50:15,100 --> 01:50:18,000
仪器工作异常  雷达也失灵了
Instruments are going haywire. Radar is down.

1586
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:20,680
我们现在只能盲飞了  听到了吗
We're flying blind out here. Do you copy?

1587
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:27,570
控制塔  再重复一遍  我们正在等候指示  出什么事了
Tower, repeat: We are standby only. What is happening?

1588
01:50:27,570 --> 01:50:31,070

你来晚了  蜘蛛侠
You're too late, Spider-Man.

1592
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:52,550
是我设计的整套电网
I designed this power grid.

1593
01:50:52,550 --> 01:50:54,390
现在我要取回
Now I'm gonna take back

1594

我要一切都臣服于我
I will control everything.

1596
01:50:58,890 --> 01:51:02,770
我将成为他们的上帝
And I will be like a god to them.

1597
01:51:02,770 --> 01:51:04,470
一个叫闪光人的上帝吗
A god named Sparkles?

1598
01:51:14,410 --> 01:51:16,080
这次我不会重蹈覆辙了
Not this time.

1599
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:18,200
你就这点能耐吗  来啊

真是太感谢了  格温・史黛西
Oh, thank you, Gwen Stacy.

1603
01:52:08,130 --> 01:52:10,010
加把劲  不过是几根骨头
Just shake it off. It's just your bones,

-会爆炸  -对
