Enter Nowhere 2011 Horror English

2
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,863
Register... now! Everything!

3
00:02:42,743 --> 00:02:44,103
Do it!

4
00:02:44,223 --> 00:02:45,423
I'll open it.

5
00:02:45,543 --> 00:02:48,823
Come on, come on!

6
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:52,223
- What about the safe?
- We don't have time for the safe.

7
00:02:52,263 --> 00:02:53,623
- Do it now!
- There you are, here.

8
00:02:53,663 --> 00:02:56,663
Come on, come on,
come on... money.

9
00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:01,703
Get the car.

10
00:03:01,983 --> 00:03:04,103
- I said open it.
- I'll open it,

11
00:03:04,223 --> 00:03:06,503
but I don't think
you'll like what's inside.

12
00:03:06,623 --> 00:03:08,423
What the hell
are you talking about?

13
00:03:08,543 --> 00:03:10,503
Interesting life
you've chosen for yourself.

14
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,359
- Just shut the fuck up!
- All the things you could have

15
00:03:12,383 --> 00:03:16,063
done in life... you don't even care
that you're going nowhere.

16
00:03:16,783 --> 00:03:18,423
I'm gonna give you

17
00:03:18,543 --> 00:03:21,303
to the count of three.

18
00:03:21,543 --> 00:03:23,783
One

19
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:26,423
two...

20
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:48,263
You always help yourself
to other people's food?

21
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,703
Let me help you.

22
00:06:51,823 --> 00:06:54,623
I have a first aid kit inside.

23
00:07:08,743 --> 00:07:11,463
I'm sorry I helped myself
to your food.

24
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,743
It's just I haven't eaten anything
since breakfast yesterday.

25
00:07:14,863 --> 00:07:16,583
What are you doing out here?

26
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,903
Our car ran out of gas last night

27
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:23,303
and my husband went
to go look for a service station,

28
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:27,143
I don't know. Late.

29
00:07:27,263 --> 00:07:29,503
Would it be possible
to use your phone?

30
00:07:29,623 --> 00:07:31,343
Yeah, sure.
If you can find one.

31
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:33,223
Pardon?

32
00:07:33,343 --> 00:07:36,503
You know how to work
a busted radio?

33
00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:39,983
You don't know how to fix it?

34
00:07:40,103 --> 00:07:41,543
This isn't my cabin.

35
00:07:41,663 --> 00:07:43,023
Then what are you doing here?

36
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:46,383
Same as you... car trouble.

37
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,623
I've been stranded here
for three days.

38
00:07:52,743 --> 00:07:55,983
Three days?
And you haven't left?

39
00:07:56,103 --> 00:07:57,743
Where am I gonna go?
There's no phone.

40
00:07:57,863 --> 00:08:00,743
My car's toast. I haven't been able
to walk out for help.

41
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:02,983
Listen

42
00:08:03,103 --> 00:08:05,383
I appreciate your predicament,

43
00:08:05,503 --> 00:08:08,903
but I... I need
to find my husband.

44
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:12,663
Look, that read -5 last night.

45
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,743
What are you saying?

46
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,663
Nothing.

47
00:08:18,783 --> 00:08:21,543
- I'm sure he found some help.
- Oh, my God.

48
00:08:21,663 --> 00:08:24,423
Look, I'm sure he's fine.

49
00:08:30,263 --> 00:08:33,263
You have matches?

50
00:08:34,103 --> 00:08:37,263
Can I?

51
00:08:38,463 --> 00:08:41,383
I thought I was gonna
freeze to death.

52
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:53,903
How did you survive?

53
00:08:54,023 --> 00:08:56,143
It was below freezing.

54
00:08:56,263 --> 00:08:58,863
We have blankets in our car.

55
00:08:58,983 --> 00:09:02,103
I practically made
an igloo out of them.

56
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:05,583
Blankets?

57
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:09,703
I think you just became
my new best friend.

58
00:09:09,823 --> 00:09:12,583
Tom.

59
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,423
Samantha.

60
00:09:14,543 --> 00:09:18,143
How about showing me
where that car is, Sam?

61
00:09:30,463 --> 00:09:34,663
Well, you weren't kidding
when you said your car ran out of gas.

62
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:37,663
Sam?

63
00:09:39,303 --> 00:09:42,703
So what happened to you?

64
00:09:43,063 --> 00:09:45,703
I put my car in a ditch
about a half a mile up.

65
00:09:45,823 --> 00:09:50,303
When you said you had car trouble,
you weren't joking.

66
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,023
I...

67
00:09:52,143 --> 00:09:54,903
- Practically broke my leg.
- Oh, my goodness.

68
00:09:55,023 --> 00:09:58,383
It doesn't hurt now.

69
00:10:00,023 --> 00:10:02,143
I'm gonna stay here
for a little while,

70
00:10:02,263 --> 00:10:03,943
wait for my husband to get back.

71
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:07,063
I'll stay with you.

72
00:10:16,543 --> 00:10:18,543
That's a good idea.

73
00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:22,223
Just in case, you know?

74
00:10:23,743 --> 00:10:26,583
It'll be getting' dark soon.

75
00:10:28,383 --> 00:10:31,223
We really should get back before
the temperature drops.

76
00:10:31,343 --> 00:10:35,503
What if Adam comes back
and I'm not here?

77
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,703
We'll leave him a note. Do you have
any pen and paper in the car?

78
00:10:38,823 --> 00:10:41,503
Maybe in the glove box.

79
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:14,023
How do you know
no one lives there?

80
00:11:14,143 --> 00:11:17,903
Well, if someone does,
they haven't been there in a while.

81
00:11:21,343 --> 00:11:22,783
Pretty cool car.

82
00:11:22,903 --> 00:11:24,423
You think so?

83
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,623
Yeah, it's a classic.

84
00:11:43,023 --> 00:11:44,743
Here... here, I'll take that.

85
00:11:44,863 --> 00:11:47,983
Thank you.

86
00:11:53,423 --> 00:11:56,583
Is there a bathroom anywhere?

87
00:11:56,703 --> 00:11:58,463
You see all this?

88
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,623
There's your bathroom.

89
00:12:05,023 --> 00:12:07,903
Right.

90
00:12:36,303 --> 00:12:37,903
There you go.

91
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,343
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

92
00:12:40,463 --> 00:12:43,663
Those blankets are a lifesaver.

93
00:12:44,543 --> 00:12:47,703
So where's the water
from anyway?

94
00:12:47,823 --> 00:12:49,303
Oh, I found a creek outback.

95
00:12:49,423 --> 00:12:51,623
Well, at least we won't go thirsty.

96
00:12:51,743 --> 00:12:53,543
About that

97
00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:56,223
I tried to find the creek again,

98
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:57,463
but I couldn't find it.

99
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,623
So we have one tank of gas.

100
00:13:00,743 --> 00:13:03,783
Right. You know,
I've got some paint buckets

101
00:13:03,863 --> 00:13:05,983
and some rubber hosing
in the back of my truck.

102
00:13:06,143 --> 00:13:08,863
I bet I could siphon gas
from my car to yours.

103
00:13:08,983 --> 00:13:11,903
- Would that work?
- Yeah, I think it would.

104
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,663
Get us out of here.

105
00:13:13,823 --> 00:13:15,663
Get us to your husband.

106
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:18,063
I should've never let him go.

107
00:13:18,183 --> 00:13:20,343
When Adam gets
an idea in his head,

108
00:13:20,463 --> 00:13:21,863
there's no stopping him.

109
00:13:22,023 --> 00:13:24,903
Well, why didn't you
just go with him?

110
00:13:27,903 --> 00:13:29,183
He

111
00:13:29,303 --> 00:13:31,263
Didn't want me to leave the car

112
00:13:31,383 --> 00:13:35,703
- in my condition.
- What's your condition?

113
00:13:38,743 --> 00:13:41,503
I'm pregnant.

114
00:13:41,623 --> 00:13:42,823
You're smoking.

115
00:13:42,943 --> 00:13:45,343
I know.

116
00:13:45,463 --> 00:13:48,863
It's my last pack.

117
00:13:49,023 --> 00:13:51,263
We were on our way to

118
00:13:51,383 --> 00:13:54,623
see his parents before he ships off

119
00:13:54,743 --> 00:13:57,663
tell them the news.
He ships out in two weeks.

120
00:13:57,783 --> 00:14:01,503
Anyway, I smoke when I'm nervous,

121
00:14:01,663 --> 00:14:04,863
obviously.

122
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:06,383
Tonight you can have the bed.

123
00:14:06,503 --> 00:14:09,343
I'll sleep on the floor.

124
00:14:09,463 --> 00:14:11,023
I'm gonna get us out of here.

125
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:14,223
Okay.

126
00:15:26,743 --> 00:15:30,223
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my goodness.

127
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:33,223
Are you okay?

128
00:17:06,703 --> 00:17:08,983
Where am I?

129
00:17:10,823 --> 00:17:13,103
You... you were out
in the cold and...

130
00:17:13,223 --> 00:17:15,183
Who are you?

131
00:17:15,303 --> 00:17:19,463
My name is Samantha.
Who are you?

132
00:17:25,943 --> 00:17:27,943
- I was just trying to help you.
- Where's Kevin?

133
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,463
I don't know who that is.

134
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,903
- Where is he?
- You were asleep on the porch.

135
00:17:33,023 --> 00:17:35,303
I found you out there.
I brought you inside.

136
00:17:35,423 --> 00:17:38,183
That is all I know.

137
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,063
Where are you going?

138
00:17:45,183 --> 00:17:46,623
Away from here.

139
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:48,543
Well, if you find anyone

140
00:17:48,663 --> 00:17:52,183
will you please tell them
about this cabin?

141
00:17:52,463 --> 00:17:56,103
And if you don't,
you're welcome to come back here.

142
00:18:06,423 --> 00:18:09,543
Shit!

143
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:39,583
Hello?

144
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:43,103
Is anybody out there?

145
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:54,183
- Tom?
- No, not Tom... Jody.

146
00:18:54,543 --> 00:18:57,503
Did you see anyone at the road?

147
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,063
Excuse me!

148
00:19:00,183 --> 00:19:01,583
Where is your phone?

149
00:19:01,703 --> 00:19:03,103
We don't have a phone.

150
00:19:03,223 --> 00:19:05,743
What? What the hell
kinda place is this?

151
00:19:05,863 --> 00:19:08,383
You don't have to be so rude.

152
00:19:08,503 --> 00:19:10,023
I thought you said
I was welcome back.

153
00:19:10,143 --> 00:19:12,063
Well, you are but...

154
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:14,183
Listen

155
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,903
what's your name again?

156
00:19:16,023 --> 00:19:17,663
Samantha.

157
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:19,583
Right... Sam,

158
00:19:19,703 --> 00:19:22,223
I don't know if you're a hermit

159
00:19:22,343 --> 00:19:24,383
or a serial killer
or whatever your deal is,

160
00:19:24,503 --> 00:19:26,303
but I need to get a phone, okay?

161
00:19:26,423 --> 00:19:28,303
And I need to get the hell
out of here. Capisce?

162
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,343
I just told you,
we don't have a phone.

163
00:19:30,463 --> 00:19:31,879
Now if you'll just let me explain...

164
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:33,983
Okay, so there is
no form of communication

165
00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:36,383
anywhere in this god damn shack?

166
00:19:36,503 --> 00:19:40,183
We have a broken ham radio.

167
00:19:41,823 --> 00:19:42,863
Awesome.

168
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:46,023
What am I supposed
to do with that?

169
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,743
I don't... is there a bathroom?

170
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,943
We don't have one.

171
00:19:52,143 --> 00:19:53,943
I am in hell.

172
00:19:54,063 --> 00:19:57,583
I am in the third ring of hell.

173
00:19:58,423 --> 00:20:00,863
Did you see anyone by the road?

174
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:03,263
Yeah, I heard some crazy guy
yelling in the distance,

175
00:20:03,383 --> 00:20:05,823
but I don't know
if he was your friend or not.

176
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:07,943
But, you know, I've seen
"Deliverance" enough times

177
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,023
to know that you don't
go messing with the locals.

178
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:13,623
"Deliverance"?

179
00:20:14,063 --> 00:20:17,303
You've never seen "Deliverance"?

180
00:20:17,503 --> 00:20:20,143
"Squeal like a pig"?

181
00:20:20,263 --> 00:20:22,983
Oh, boy.

182
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,383
Great.

183
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:18,863
I like your lighter.

184
00:21:18,983 --> 00:21:21,583
Really? 'Cause there's
only a zillion of them

185
00:21:21,703 --> 00:21:23,903
in every gas station in America.

186
00:21:24,023 --> 00:21:25,983
But I guess when
you live in a cabin,

187
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:27,583
you don't get out that much.

188
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,263
Oh, I don't live here.

189
00:21:30,383 --> 00:21:34,503
- You don't?
- No, I'm like you.

190
00:21:34,863 --> 00:21:37,103
My husband and I ran out of gas

191
00:21:37,223 --> 00:21:38,783
and got stuck here.

192
00:21:38,903 --> 00:21:42,743
I wound up at this cabin
yesterday morning.

193
00:21:43,383 --> 00:21:45,583
First of all, Sam,

194
00:21:45,703 --> 00:21:49,103
you're nothing like me.

195
00:21:50,503 --> 00:21:52,743
If I don't live here
and you don't live here,

196
00:21:52,863 --> 00:21:56,143
then who lives here?

197
00:21:57,303 --> 00:22:00,143
What?

198
00:22:00,463 --> 00:22:02,143
I thought I heard something.

199
00:22:02,263 --> 00:22:03,823
Shit.

200
00:22:03,943 --> 00:22:07,583
You're more paranoid than me
and you ain't even smoking.

201
00:22:12,703 --> 00:22:14,623
Who's this?

202
00:22:14,743 --> 00:22:16,383
I'm Jody.

203
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:17,383
Are you the husband?

204
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,463
No, this is Tom.

205
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:20,823
Pleasure to meet you.

206
00:22:20,943 --> 00:22:23,423
How did it go with the cars?

207
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:26,423
It didn't go,
but I got you these shoes.

208
00:22:26,543 --> 00:22:28,383
I figured you could use them.

209
00:22:28,503 --> 00:22:31,623
Thank you.

210
00:22:35,423 --> 00:22:37,023
What is that,
weed you're smoking?

211
00:22:37,143 --> 00:22:38,703
You a cop?

212
00:22:38,823 --> 00:22:40,743
Hardly.

213
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:45,343
So what's your story?

214
00:22:45,463 --> 00:22:47,743
My story?
What's your story?

215
00:22:47,863 --> 00:22:50,183
It's an epic saga.
You first.

216
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:51,783
I've been stranded up here four days,

217
00:22:51,863 --> 00:22:53,543
living off granola and creek water.

218
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,583
What do you mean, stranded?

219
00:22:55,703 --> 00:22:58,943
He got in a car accident.

220
00:22:59,063 --> 00:23:02,183
Listen, Sam, we shouldn't
keep the Axe outside.

221
00:23:02,303 --> 00:23:04,743
- It's our only weapon.
- Why would we need a weapon?

222
00:23:04,863 --> 00:23:07,743
We're in the wilderness
and I thought I heard a gunshot.

223
00:23:07,863 --> 00:23:09,183
A gunshot?

224
00:23:09,303 --> 00:23:12,703
Okay, no bathrooms,

225
00:23:12,823 --> 00:23:15,903
no phone, and now you guys
are talking about weapons?

226
00:23:16,023 --> 00:23:19,663
This is a great operation
you guys are running here and all,

227
00:23:19,783 --> 00:23:23,223
but I'm not gonna be part of it.
I'm outta here.

228
00:23:23,343 --> 00:23:25,063
It's below freezing at night.

229
00:23:25,183 --> 00:23:29,703
- I'll take my chances.
- You'll be dead in the morning.

230
00:23:30,223 --> 00:23:33,183
If suicide's your plan, go for it.

231
00:23:33,303 --> 00:23:37,263
But would you mind leaving behind
your vintage ski jacket?

232
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:40,583
Samantha here
could probably use it.

233
00:23:40,863 --> 00:23:42,663
Now I want to know your story.

234
00:23:42,783 --> 00:23:44,983
My name's Jody from Detroit.

235
00:23:45,103 --> 00:23:46,903
I got into a fight
with my boyfriend.

236
00:23:47,023 --> 00:23:49,319
He kicked me out of the car
and left me on the side of the road.

237
00:23:49,343 --> 00:23:50,423
Why would he do that?

238
00:23:50,543 --> 00:23:51,743
'Cause he's a dickhead.

239
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,543
And that's all
you deserve to know.

240
00:23:54,663 --> 00:23:57,063
Well, Jody from Detroit,
you can stay here tonight.

241
00:23:57,183 --> 00:24:01,783
But you're gonna have to start
pitching in... starting with that lighter.

242
00:24:07,543 --> 00:24:09,063
Oh, and for your information,

243
00:24:09,183 --> 00:24:11,423
this is a brand-new jacket

244
00:24:11,543 --> 00:24:15,463
For your information
I don't give a shit.

245
00:24:20,703 --> 00:24:22,023
What are you doing?

246
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:24,503
I'm nailing it shut.

247
00:24:24,623 --> 00:24:27,583
It'll be warmer this way.

248
00:24:28,063 --> 00:24:30,823
So what was
the sleeping situation

249
00:24:30,943 --> 00:24:32,983
- like last night?
- I slept on the floor.

250
00:24:33,103 --> 00:24:35,063
Really?

251
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:37,463
Two people alone in the woods,

252
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:40,703
with a cabin.

253
00:24:43,863 --> 00:24:45,503
What are you insinuating?

254
00:24:45,623 --> 00:24:47,303
Nothing.

255
00:24:47,423 --> 00:24:49,143
I have a husband.

256
00:24:49,263 --> 00:24:50,903
- So?
- Why don't you just keep

257
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:53,583
- your thoughts to yourself?
- I would never do that.

258
00:24:53,703 --> 00:24:54,983
Shame. I'd do him.

259
00:24:55,103 --> 00:24:56,863
Enough!

260
00:24:56,983 --> 00:24:59,423
If you're wondering about
tonight's sleeping situation,

261
00:24:59,543 --> 00:25:01,623
you've got the floor.

262
00:25:01,743 --> 00:25:04,703
Samantha keeps the bed.

263
00:25:05,143 --> 00:25:07,623
You're so protective, Tom.
Am I on the floor next to you?

264
00:25:07,743 --> 00:25:10,143
- You're on the floor next to you.
- Boring.

265
00:25:10,263 --> 00:25:13,023
Do you always make people
hate you within an hour?

266
00:25:13,143 --> 00:25:16,583
I just don't understand why at least
me and her can't share the bed.

267
00:25:16,703 --> 00:25:19,743
Because I said so.

268
00:25:19,863 --> 00:25:22,143
Because she's pregnant.

269
00:25:22,263 --> 00:25:24,223
She's pregnant?

270
00:25:24,343 --> 00:25:25,943
Good job with the smoking, Sam.

271
00:25:26,063 --> 00:25:29,183
Are you trying to give the fetus cancer
before it's even born?

272
00:25:30,503 --> 00:25:32,063
Leave her alone.

273
00:25:32,183 --> 00:25:34,503
God, you are so high and mighty.

274
00:25:34,623 --> 00:25:37,823
Well, how is it that you got to this
cabin days and days before us?

275
00:25:37,943 --> 00:25:39,903
I crashed my car into a ditch.

276
00:25:40,023 --> 00:25:42,023
Yeah, and where is this ditch?

277
00:25:42,143 --> 00:25:44,303
- It's back at the road.
- How do we know you're not

278
00:25:44,423 --> 00:25:47,623
just some lumberjack psycho
who lures young women to his cabin

279
00:25:47,743 --> 00:25:49,439
and tells them
there's no way to communicate

280
00:25:49,463 --> 00:25:50,783
or get back to the real world?

281
00:25:50,903 --> 00:25:52,583
You can leave whenever
you want, lady.

282
00:25:52,703 --> 00:25:56,583
- You nailed the door shut!
- Because it's freezing outside!

283
00:25:57,463 --> 00:25:59,263
I'm no murderer or rapist

284
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:01,223
or whatever sick shit
you wanna dream up.

285
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:02,823
- Then who are you?
- I'm just a guy

286
00:26:02,943 --> 00:26:05,623
with one thing on his mind... survival.

287
00:26:05,743 --> 00:26:09,023
And don't think for one second
that you being here

288
00:26:09,143 --> 00:26:14,183
is helping our food situation
at all, 'cause it's not.

289
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,943
Let's just get some sleep.

290
00:26:51,063 --> 00:26:54,503
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

291
00:26:55,943 --> 00:26:59,423
Where's your little boyfriend at?

292
00:26:59,943 --> 00:27:02,263
He's not my boyfriend.
I have a husband.

293
00:27:02,383 --> 00:27:04,383
Oh, yeah.

294
00:27:04,503 --> 00:27:06,343
Whatever.

295
00:27:06,463 --> 00:27:09,343
Where did Mr. Rogers
go to this time?

296
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:11,783
Well, now that his leg
is feeling better,

297
00:27:11,903 --> 00:27:15,263
he decided to walk as far as he can and
try and find that creek and get help.

298
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,103
Crap, is this all
the food that we have?

299
00:27:17,223 --> 00:27:20,543
Yes, and we need to conserve it.

300
00:27:20,743 --> 00:27:24,103
Right.

301
00:27:27,703 --> 00:27:30,063
Well, I'm just gonna go.

302
00:27:30,183 --> 00:27:31,743
I don't wanna waste
all your food.

303
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:34,223
- No, it's not like that.
- No, it's cool. It's fine.

304
00:27:34,343 --> 00:27:36,703
There's gotta be some place
with electricity around here,

305
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:38,143
so I'm just gonna go.

306
00:27:38,263 --> 00:27:41,343
Tom's been looking for days
and he hasn't found anything.

307
00:27:41,463 --> 00:27:43,543
Well, I'm just gonna go
in the opposite direction.

308
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:47,503
I mean, he keeps going out the front,
I'm just gonna go out the back.

309
00:27:47,703 --> 00:27:50,543
I don't mean to be a bitch.
It just comes naturally to me.

310
00:27:50,663 --> 00:27:53,663
So no hard feelings.

311
00:27:53,783 --> 00:27:57,303
And if I never see you again,
then good luck.

312
00:27:57,423 --> 00:28:00,263
You too.

313
00:29:40,183 --> 00:29:41,903
You're back.

314
00:29:42,023 --> 00:29:47,623
Yeah, you miss me?

315
00:30:03,943 --> 00:30:06,303
Thanks.

316
00:30:06,423 --> 00:30:10,063
So where were you headed
before you ended up here?

317
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,143
We were on our way
to my husband's parents' house

318
00:30:13,263 --> 00:30:15,983
to tell them the news.

319
00:30:16,103 --> 00:30:19,743
They hate me.

320
00:30:20,423 --> 00:30:21,663
You?

321
00:30:21,783 --> 00:30:25,623
Miss Goody-Two Shoes? Why?

322
00:30:26,903 --> 00:30:30,543
They're Jewish.
I'm Catholic.

323
00:30:32,703 --> 00:30:34,343
You know, you don't
look knocked up.

324
00:30:34,463 --> 00:30:37,343
I just found out
about a week ago.

325
00:30:37,463 --> 00:30:39,983
I'm due in October
or early November.

326
00:30:40,103 --> 00:30:43,863
So he's gonna be
a little Scorpio hellion just like me.

327
00:30:43,983 --> 00:30:46,663
I'm November 11th,

328
00:30:46,783 --> 00:30:48,863
but I ain't having kids.

329
00:30:48,983 --> 00:30:52,943
Somehow I think the world
would be better for it.

330
00:30:53,623 --> 00:30:54,783
Good one, Sam.

331
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:58,383
You're starting
to loosen up a bit.

332
00:30:58,703 --> 00:31:01,063
Where do the parents live?

333
00:31:01,183 --> 00:31:03,103
Just outside of Concord,
New Hampshire.

334
00:31:03,223 --> 00:31:05,263
That's kind of a schlep.

335
00:31:05,383 --> 00:31:06,943
Not really.

336
00:31:07,063 --> 00:31:10,583
Trust me, I've been
to that shithole of a town.

337
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:15,023
I wouldn't go
within 100 miles of there.

338
00:31:16,023 --> 00:31:18,143
Are you from San Diego?

339
00:31:18,263 --> 00:31:20,423
You look like a San Diego chick.

340
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:22,703
Virginia.

341
00:31:22,823 --> 00:31:26,223
Virginia?
Well then,

342
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:27,943
what are you doing in Wisconsin?

343
00:31:28,063 --> 00:31:29,663
Excuse me?

344
00:31:29,783 --> 00:31:32,943
Well, if you were on your way to
New Hampshire, coming from Virginia,

345
00:31:33,063 --> 00:31:37,223
then how did you wind up
in Wisconsin? Wrong turn?

346
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:42,023
We're not in Wisconsin.

347
00:31:43,263 --> 00:31:45,703
Look, I'm not trying
to be an asshole,

348
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:48,423
but we're just 50 miles

349
00:31:48,543 --> 00:31:50,143
outside of Milwaukee.

350
00:31:50,263 --> 00:31:54,823
No, we're about two hours
from Concord, New Hampshire.

351
00:31:56,983 --> 00:31:59,023
Well, I find that hard to believe,

352
00:31:59,143 --> 00:32:01,983
because I was headed to Seattle
coming from Detroit,

353
00:32:02,103 --> 00:32:06,543
so there's no way I could be
in fucking Concord, New Hampshire.

354
00:32:37,343 --> 00:32:40,383
You gotta be kidding me.

355
00:32:48,503 --> 00:32:51,343
Okay, I think I'm going crazy.

356
00:32:51,463 --> 00:32:54,143
I could have sworn I was
heading in a straight line,

357
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,783
and then I just ended up back here.

358
00:32:56,903 --> 00:32:59,183
I'll tell you who's crazy...
that bitch.

359
00:32:59,303 --> 00:33:02,143
- What are you talking about?
- She thinks we're in New Hampshire.

360
00:33:02,263 --> 00:33:03,863
- New Hampshire?
- Yeah.

361
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:06,223
She says she's on her way
to Concord, New Hampshire,

362
00:33:06,343 --> 00:33:10,023
coming from Virginia.

363
00:33:10,903 --> 00:33:14,183
- Ask her!
- Yeah, I'll ask her.

364
00:33:27,863 --> 00:33:29,863
How did it go?

365
00:33:29,983 --> 00:33:32,063
Listen

366
00:33:32,183 --> 00:33:33,383
I was talking with Jody

367
00:33:33,503 --> 00:33:35,903
I can't take her any more, Tom.
I can't.

368
00:33:36,023 --> 00:33:37,663
She's out of her mind.

369
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:41,703
No one's gonna fight you
on that one.

370
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,223
But she did tell me
something kind of odd.

371
00:33:45,343 --> 00:33:47,183
She said we're not
in New Hampshire?

372
00:33:47,303 --> 00:33:48,863
Right.

373
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:51,183
See, she's clearly lost it.

374
00:33:51,303 --> 00:33:56,263
But we're not in New Hampshire.

375
00:33:57,663 --> 00:34:01,023
Did you get Tom to go along
with your little game?

376
00:34:01,143 --> 00:34:03,863
Samantha, it's not a game.

377
00:34:03,983 --> 00:34:07,583
We're nowhere near New Hampshire.

378
00:34:07,983 --> 00:34:11,583
Well, we sure as hell
are not in Wisconsin.

379
00:34:14,063 --> 00:34:16,463
Wisconsin?

380
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:19,743
I never said anything
about Wisconsin.

381
00:34:21,223 --> 00:34:23,303
What the hell did you just say?

382
00:34:23,423 --> 00:34:24,863
Where do you think we are, Tom?

383
00:34:24,983 --> 00:34:26,303
South Dakota.

384
00:34:26,423 --> 00:34:28,703
South Dakota?
What are you talking about?

385
00:34:28,823 --> 00:34:30,743
We're like 50 miles
outside of Milwaukee.

386
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:32,263
I think I know where I am.

387
00:34:32,383 --> 00:34:34,463
I was going from Oklahoma City
to South Dakota.

388
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:36,423
You guys are both crazy.

389
00:34:36,543 --> 00:34:38,463
I'm not in Wisconsin!
There's no way.

390
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:43,143
Well, there's sure as hell no way
that I'm in god damn South Dakota!

391
00:34:48,383 --> 00:34:49,903
Something's not right
about this cabin.

392
00:34:49,943 --> 00:34:52,623
No. You know what, Tom?

393
00:34:52,743 --> 00:34:54,143
You're not right, okay?

394
00:34:54,263 --> 00:34:56,223
Fuck South Dakota,
fuck New Hampshire,

395
00:34:56,343 --> 00:34:58,863
and fuck you!
And fuck you too!

396
00:35:00,063 --> 00:35:01,063
Be honest with me!

397
00:35:01,143 --> 00:35:05,583
Do you really think
we're somewhere in Wisconsin?

398
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:08,143
Honestly?

399
00:35:10,023 --> 00:35:12,903
New Hampshire?

400
00:35:29,063 --> 00:35:31,343
This doesn't make any sense.

401
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:34,263
What, did we disappear?

402
00:35:36,423 --> 00:35:38,823
No.

403
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:42,863
If we disappeared,
then how could Adam find us?

404
00:35:43,863 --> 00:35:47,463
You don't think
he's alive, do you?

405
00:35:48,023 --> 00:35:51,783
- It doesn't matter what I think.
- Answer the question.

406
00:35:55,503 --> 00:35:58,343
No.

407
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:03,463
No.

408
00:36:03,823 --> 00:36:06,623
If we don't do something,

409
00:36:06,743 --> 00:36:10,263
we're gonna run out of food
and water if we stay here.

410
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:15,023
Tomorrow we're just gonna have
to walk as far as we can go.

411
00:36:15,703 --> 00:36:18,503
We may be dead either way,

412
00:36:18,623 --> 00:36:21,823
but I'd rather die trying.

413
00:36:47,223 --> 00:36:49,263
Forget the road, Tom.

414
00:36:49,383 --> 00:36:51,063
Why?

415
00:36:51,183 --> 00:36:55,383
You've gone that way
long enough.

416
00:36:58,263 --> 00:37:01,263
Fine.

417
00:38:01,303 --> 00:38:05,983
Look, I'm sorry
if I made you angry.

418
00:38:06,103 --> 00:38:08,223
I'm sure Adam's fine.

419
00:38:08,343 --> 00:38:13,263
I'm not angry because
you think my husband is dead.

420
00:38:14,143 --> 00:38:18,063
I'm angry because
I think you're right.

421
00:38:37,303 --> 00:38:38,663
Between you and me,

422
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:41,183
I think your husband's just fine.

423
00:38:41,303 --> 00:38:44,383
I don't want
to talk about my husband.

424
00:38:44,503 --> 00:38:47,263
What about your boyfriend?

425
00:38:47,383 --> 00:38:49,983
He's an asshole.

426
00:38:50,103 --> 00:38:52,343
A bad influence as
my "mother" would say.

427
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,263
Your "mother"?

428
00:38:54,383 --> 00:38:56,703
Yeah. I actually
never met my mother.

429
00:38:56,823 --> 00:38:58,143
She died the day I was born.

430
00:38:58,263 --> 00:39:00,943
I was raised
with my grandparents.

431
00:39:01,063 --> 00:39:02,943
Ladies,

432
00:39:03,063 --> 00:39:04,863
let's keep it moving. Jeez.

433
00:39:04,983 --> 00:39:07,223
I wanna get out of here
before it gets dark.

434
00:39:07,343 --> 00:39:10,183
Yeah.

435
00:39:13,463 --> 00:39:17,223
So is this the farthest
you've gotten mileage-wise?

436
00:39:18,463 --> 00:39:20,943
Are you okay?

437
00:39:21,063 --> 00:39:23,863
Where'd you get all that money?

438
00:39:24,503 --> 00:39:25,863
None of your business.

439
00:39:25,983 --> 00:39:28,263
Well, I'm making it my business.

440
00:39:28,383 --> 00:39:30,423
I got it working
with my boyfriend, okay?

441
00:39:30,543 --> 00:39:33,503
And that's all you need to know.

442
00:39:33,783 --> 00:39:35,703
Guys?

443
00:39:35,823 --> 00:39:39,223
What's this?

444
00:39:50,223 --> 00:39:53,063
What is that?

445
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,583
Need some help there, Tom?

446
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:14,983
I got it.

447
00:40:17,423 --> 00:40:20,143
There we go.

448
00:40:51,103 --> 00:40:53,823
Oh, my God.

449
00:40:54,543 --> 00:40:56,263
It's like a military bomb shelter.

450
00:40:56,383 --> 00:40:58,383
Jesus, Jody!

451
00:40:58,503 --> 00:41:00,383
Sorry.

452
00:41:03,543 --> 00:41:05,943
These maps must be 20 years old.

453
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:09,583
Try so.

454
00:41:10,223 --> 00:41:13,983
Hey, you guys, look.

455
00:41:19,303 --> 00:41:22,303
- It's vintage 1925.
- Shit.

456
00:41:22,423 --> 00:41:25,903
It must be worth a fortune.

457
00:41:26,103 --> 00:41:29,263
Liebfraumilch.

458
00:41:30,103 --> 00:41:34,143
This is German,
same as the maps.

459
00:41:41,463 --> 00:41:45,303
It looks like Poland.

460
00:41:46,543 --> 00:41:49,263
How do you know?

461
00:41:50,143 --> 00:41:53,223
My father was German.

462
00:42:01,463 --> 00:42:04,223
Beans.

463
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,863
More beans.

464
00:42:10,423 --> 00:42:12,623
- Sausage.
- Your dad taught you well.

465
00:42:12,743 --> 00:42:17,063
My mother taught me.
I actually never met my father.

466
00:42:19,063 --> 00:42:21,863
Really?

467
00:42:27,903 --> 00:42:31,903
Why are you looking
at me like that?

468
00:42:32,463 --> 00:42:34,143
Nothing, it's just

469
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:37,623
I didn't think we had
anything in common until now.

470
00:42:37,743 --> 00:42:41,383
What do we have in common?

471
00:42:41,903 --> 00:42:45,503
My dad died in the war too.

472
00:42:48,343 --> 00:42:49,983
I'm sorry.

473
00:42:50,103 --> 00:42:51,943
No, I mean, it happens.

474
00:42:52,063 --> 00:42:53,863
That's life, you know?

475
00:42:53,983 --> 00:42:55,983
Oh, look. Cigarettes, Sam,

476
00:42:56,103 --> 00:42:58,463
to kill your fetus some more.

477
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:01,343
- Cool it.
- I'm kidding.

478
00:43:01,463 --> 00:43:05,903
Let's just pack up some food
and get out of here.

479
00:43:09,383 --> 00:43:13,223
Tom, I can't carry all this alone.

480
00:43:21,023 --> 00:43:23,543
It's impossible.

481
00:43:23,663 --> 00:43:27,463
I'm starting to think
anything's possible.

482
00:43:29,463 --> 00:43:31,543
No, it's

483
00:43:31,663 --> 00:43:33,183
it's like we're trapped!

484
00:43:33,303 --> 00:43:35,663
It's like... it's like Pac-Man.

485
00:43:35,783 --> 00:43:37,183
Pac-Man?

486
00:43:37,303 --> 00:43:38,823
Yeah, you know

487
00:43:38,943 --> 00:43:41,263
you go in one side of the board
and come out the other,

488
00:43:41,383 --> 00:43:44,823
but it's always the same board.

489
00:43:46,783 --> 00:43:50,103
How do you get
to the next level?

490
00:43:58,023 --> 00:44:01,223
It can't be.

491
00:44:21,263 --> 00:44:22,743
Tomorrow we're gonna
have to split up,

492
00:44:22,823 --> 00:44:24,639
go in separate directions,
try to get out of here.

493
00:44:24,663 --> 00:44:26,583
No fucking way.
That is the worst thing

494
00:44:26,703 --> 00:44:30,943
we could do at this moment.
Besides where is here?

495
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:34,143
I don't know.

496
00:44:34,983 --> 00:44:37,383
No one's out there
looking for me anyway.

497
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,423
Nobody?

498
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:42,503
- Nobody.
- Why is that?

499
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:45,543
Because I was raised
in an orphanage in South Dakota

500
00:44:45,663 --> 00:44:48,383
because my mother was executed.

501
00:44:48,503 --> 00:44:52,143
So like I said, nobody.

502
00:44:57,943 --> 00:45:00,383
I could be dead and missing
and no one would even notice.

503
00:45:00,503 --> 00:45:04,303
- That is not true.
- Thank you, Sam, but it's true.

504
00:45:04,423 --> 00:45:07,743
So you were headed home.

505
00:45:07,863 --> 00:45:09,279
It doesn't matter
where I was headed.

506
00:45:09,303 --> 00:45:12,183
Well, it might be helpful.

507
00:45:12,503 --> 00:45:14,703
I was headed back to the orphanage
where I was raised.

508
00:45:14,823 --> 00:45:16,983
- Why?
- To visit an old friend.

509
00:45:17,103 --> 00:45:20,103
Can we change
the subject, please?

510
00:45:20,463 --> 00:45:22,263
I'd like to say grace.

511
00:45:22,383 --> 00:45:24,583
Sorry, I'm an atheist.

512
00:45:24,703 --> 00:45:26,543
I'm willing to try
anything at this point.

513
00:45:26,663 --> 00:45:29,423
I'll make it quick.

514
00:45:30,263 --> 00:45:33,303
Okay.

515
00:45:45,623 --> 00:45:48,743
Damn, it's freezing out here.

516
00:45:48,903 --> 00:45:52,343
Here, take a swig of this,
it'll warm you up.

517
00:45:55,223 --> 00:45:59,423
I think we were
abducted by aliens.

518
00:45:59,543 --> 00:46:00,863
What?

519
00:46:01,023 --> 00:46:03,663
Yeah. I think we were
abducted by aliens,

520
00:46:03,823 --> 00:46:05,583
taken on a space ship,
knocked out

521
00:46:05,743 --> 00:46:09,183
and then dropped somewhere
in the mountains.

522
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:12,023
It could have happened
while I was sleeping in my car.

523
00:46:12,183 --> 00:46:15,223
Yeah, we could be near Area 51.

524
00:46:15,343 --> 00:46:16,983
Let's stop with the aliens.

525
00:46:17,103 --> 00:46:18,503
But, Tom,

526
00:46:18,663 --> 00:46:22,063
you kinda look like an alien.

527
00:46:22,183 --> 00:46:24,423
Very funny.

528
00:46:24,503 --> 00:46:27,943
Laugh it up.

529
00:46:28,623 --> 00:46:31,823
Aliens.

530
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:52,063
Where are you going?

531
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,943
Nature calls, ladies.

532
00:47:03,663 --> 00:47:06,183
Can I see it?

533
00:47:06,303 --> 00:47:10,783
The money? I don't think
I've ever seen that much before.

534
00:47:25,423 --> 00:47:27,263
How?

535
00:47:27,383 --> 00:47:30,423
You really wanna know?

536
00:47:37,263 --> 00:47:39,063
I rob gas stations
with my boyfriend.

537
00:47:39,183 --> 00:47:40,503
Really?

538
00:47:40,623 --> 00:47:42,783
Hardware stores, delis

539
00:47:42,903 --> 00:47:43,943
whoever seems harmless.

540
00:47:44,063 --> 00:47:46,103
Sometimes we'll get a Kmart

541
00:47:46,223 --> 00:47:49,183
just to rob somebody corporate.

542
00:47:49,983 --> 00:47:52,623
Nice try.

543
00:47:53,583 --> 00:47:55,383
Let me tell you something, Sam.

544
00:47:55,503 --> 00:47:57,663
I don't lie.

545
00:47:57,783 --> 00:47:59,863
Not about what state I'm in

546
00:47:59,983 --> 00:48:03,063
or how I get by.
I don't lie.

547
00:48:03,183 --> 00:48:05,503
Got me?

548
00:48:05,623 --> 00:48:08,023
I ain't no precious
little Catholic schoolgirl,

549
00:48:08,143 --> 00:48:11,303
I ain't been privileged enough
to afford college

550
00:48:11,423 --> 00:48:13,863
or whatever else
people expect of me.

551
00:48:13,983 --> 00:48:16,343
So I rob people.

552
00:48:16,463 --> 00:48:19,703
You understand?

553
00:48:21,703 --> 00:48:24,463
Yeah.

554
00:48:34,903 --> 00:48:37,063
This isn't even real.

555
00:48:37,183 --> 00:48:39,503
What are you talking about?
Of course it's real.

556
00:48:39,623 --> 00:48:41,783
It says it was printed in 1984.

557
00:48:41,903 --> 00:48:43,783
What did you rob, a gag store?

558
00:48:43,903 --> 00:48:45,783
What exactly is the gag?

559
00:48:45,903 --> 00:48:48,503
I've never heard of the treasury

560
00:48:48,623 --> 00:48:52,143
printing money from the future,
have you?

561
00:48:56,583 --> 00:49:00,103
What?

562
00:49:11,063 --> 00:49:12,943
Samantha,

563
00:49:13,063 --> 00:49:15,623
what war did your father die in?

564
00:49:15,743 --> 00:49:18,623
World War ll of course.

565
00:49:18,743 --> 00:49:22,463
He was killed
in a massive air-strike.

566
00:49:23,343 --> 00:49:25,823
Okay, Sam, I'm gonna
ask you a question, okay?

567
00:49:25,943 --> 00:49:30,223
And I don't want you
to take this the wrong way.

568
00:49:31,183 --> 00:49:35,383
What year do you think it is?

569
00:49:35,703 --> 00:49:39,143
1962.

570
00:49:39,863 --> 00:49:43,903
What year do you think it is?

571
00:49:54,103 --> 00:49:56,703
Holy shit.

572
00:49:59,623 --> 00:50:02,103
It's freezing out there.

573
00:50:05,463 --> 00:50:08,303
What year does this say?

574
00:50:10,863 --> 00:50:12,383
1931.

575
00:50:12,503 --> 00:50:15,263
And this one?

576
00:50:16,343 --> 00:50:18,583
- 1932?
- Doesn't it strike you as odd

577
00:50:18,703 --> 00:50:20,903
- how old they are?
- No, not really.

578
00:50:21,023 --> 00:50:23,143
That bomb shelter could have
been locked up for years.

579
00:50:23,183 --> 00:50:24,983
How many years?

580
00:50:25,103 --> 00:50:28,743
Who knows?
What's going on?

581
00:50:29,743 --> 00:50:31,623
- Tom, what year is it?
- I just told you.

582
00:50:31,743 --> 00:50:33,543
No, not the bottle,
but the year now!

583
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:35,543
What year is it now?

584
00:50:35,663 --> 00:50:38,423
2011.

585
00:50:39,023 --> 00:50:40,823
Would someone tell me
what's going on?

586
00:50:40,943 --> 00:50:43,423
Okay, last time
I checked it was 1985

587
00:50:43,543 --> 00:50:45,383
and Samantha thinks
that it's 1962.

588
00:50:45,503 --> 00:50:47,383
I don't think it's 1962.
I know it is!

589
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:50,903
- This is a joke, right?
- No, believe it.

590
00:50:59,503 --> 00:51:02,103
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, I've heard it before.

591
00:51:02,223 --> 00:51:03,703
- You have?
- Yeah.

592
00:51:03,823 --> 00:51:05,559
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I don't know.

593
00:51:05,583 --> 00:51:08,223
Well, maybe it's a hunter.

594
00:51:15,703 --> 00:51:18,623
Oh, my God,
there's someone out there.

595
00:51:21,423 --> 00:51:23,383
Shit, it's Michael Myers.

596
00:51:23,503 --> 00:51:25,743
You know him?

597
00:51:25,863 --> 00:51:29,943
Not this shit again.
Tom, what do we do?

598
00:51:31,343 --> 00:51:34,143
Stay here.

599
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,983
Hey, sir,
we're stranded out here.

600
00:51:37,103 --> 00:51:38,823
Sir.

601
00:51:43,303 --> 00:51:46,623
- What?
- It's German.

602
00:51:47,343 --> 00:51:50,783
- What's he saying?
- I don't know. He's speaking too fast.

603
00:51:50,903 --> 00:51:53,503
Drop the axe, Tom.

604
00:51:53,863 --> 00:51:55,663
Hey, man, look,
we're not gonna hurt you.

605
00:51:55,783 --> 00:51:58,503
I don't think he's scared of you.

606
00:51:59,303 --> 00:52:03,743
Samantha,
say something, anything.

607
00:52:03,903 --> 00:52:08,503
We are not armed.

608
00:52:10,743 --> 00:52:15,223
I don't think
he's search and rescue.

609
00:52:38,303 --> 00:52:40,823
Are you okay?

610
00:52:40,943 --> 00:52:43,343
Yeah.

611
00:52:43,463 --> 00:52:45,823
You?

612
00:52:46,623 --> 00:52:50,103
- We're fine.
- Yeah, fine and dandy.

613
00:52:50,263 --> 00:52:51,823
Where did he go?

614
00:52:51,943 --> 00:52:53,943
I don't know.
He was trying to fix the radio.

615
00:52:54,063 --> 00:52:55,863
He's been gone all morning.

616
00:52:55,983 --> 00:52:58,263
- I think he has anger issues.
- What does he want?

617
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:00,823
Maybe he lives here.

618
00:53:00,943 --> 00:53:02,903
No.

619
00:53:03,023 --> 00:53:06,063
No one lives here.

620
00:53:08,743 --> 00:53:10,583
Ham radio,

621
00:53:10,703 --> 00:53:12,823
vintage wine, bomb shelter,

622
00:53:12,943 --> 00:53:14,903
psycho German dude.

623
00:53:15,023 --> 00:53:18,103
Holy shit.

624
00:53:18,543 --> 00:53:20,623
What?

625
00:53:20,743 --> 00:53:23,143
I think

626
00:53:23,263 --> 00:53:25,943
I think we're in
another time period.

627
00:53:26,063 --> 00:53:28,703
His time period.
What, the '30s?

628
00:53:28,823 --> 00:53:32,303
'40s maybe.
World War ll?

629
00:53:32,423 --> 00:53:36,183
Yeah, I mean that would
explain the bomb shelter.

630
00:53:36,303 --> 00:53:40,663
Tom, do you have
time travel in 2011?

631
00:53:40,783 --> 00:53:44,223
Did... did you bring us here?

632
00:53:44,343 --> 00:53:46,823
I know 2011 sounds like
a long way off,

633
00:53:46,943 --> 00:53:49,303
but we're nowhere near
that advanced yet.

634
00:53:49,423 --> 00:53:51,663
We haven't even been back
to the moon since the '60s.

635
00:53:51,783 --> 00:53:53,503
We go to the moon?

636
00:53:53,623 --> 00:53:54,623
Supposedly.

637
00:53:54,703 --> 00:53:56,303
You don't think
we went to the moon?

638
00:53:56,423 --> 00:53:58,863
Oh, and I suppose Elvis
is still alive

639
00:53:58,983 --> 00:54:00,663
and no one shot JFK, right?

640
00:54:00,783 --> 00:54:04,983
Somebody shoots JFK?

641
00:54:05,103 --> 00:54:06,543
Oh, my God.

642
00:54:06,663 --> 00:54:08,543
Maybe we shouldn't
talk about the future.

643
00:54:08,663 --> 00:54:11,383
Easy for you to say, Tom. You know
everything that's going to happen.

644
00:54:11,423 --> 00:54:14,103
Do I? I sure as hell don't know
what this guy is capable of.

645
00:54:14,223 --> 00:54:16,023
He's psychotic.

646
00:54:16,143 --> 00:54:19,063
He's afraid.

647
00:54:19,183 --> 00:54:22,023
Even worse.

648
00:54:26,063 --> 00:54:30,543
Shit, he's coming.
It's been nice knowing you guys.

649
00:54:36,783 --> 00:54:38,543
Get away from him, asshole!

650
00:54:38,663 --> 00:54:42,343
What are you gonna do?

651
00:54:50,023 --> 00:54:52,303
What do you want?

652
00:54:52,423 --> 00:54:54,143
Tom!

653
00:54:54,263 --> 00:54:57,143
Leave him alone!

654
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,463
Do you understand English?

655
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:07,703
English!

656
00:55:07,823 --> 00:55:10,183
Peaceful.

657
00:55:10,383 --> 00:55:13,583
What are you, a Nazi?

658
00:55:18,623 --> 00:55:20,463
Please,

659
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:25,863
whatever you're thinking
about doing, don't! Please!

660
00:55:48,063 --> 00:55:51,103
Halt!

661
00:55:58,943 --> 00:56:01,903
Shit!

662
00:56:02,223 --> 00:56:04,263
Jody, Sam!

663
00:56:04,383 --> 00:56:07,583
Can you hear me?

664
00:56:35,503 --> 00:56:39,103
He's a fucking Nazi.

665
00:56:49,583 --> 00:56:52,703
I'm pregnant.

666
00:56:53,103 --> 00:56:54,903
What are you doing here?

667
00:56:55,023 --> 00:56:56,503
You're an American?

668
00:56:56,623 --> 00:56:59,703
I don't...

669
00:56:59,823 --> 00:57:00,983
What are you doing here?

670
00:57:01,103 --> 00:57:05,023
Leave her alone.
Tell him I'm hungry.

671
00:57:06,263 --> 00:57:09,503
She is hungry.
We are all hungry.

672
00:57:09,623 --> 00:57:14,183
Really? Hungry?

673
00:57:21,103 --> 00:57:25,023
Who are you?

674
00:57:25,183 --> 00:57:28,623
Who are you?

675
00:57:38,903 --> 00:57:43,423
Where did you get this?

676
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:45,183
He wants to know
about your necklace.

677
00:57:45,303 --> 00:57:47,423
It was my mother's.

678
00:57:47,543 --> 00:57:49,263
It was her mother's.

679
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:51,383
No!

680
00:57:51,503 --> 00:57:56,303
You have three seconds
to tell me where you got it.

681
00:57:56,423 --> 00:57:57,463
One.

682
00:57:57,583 --> 00:57:59,823
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

683
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:01,503
Two!

684
00:58:01,623 --> 00:58:02,623
Three!

685
00:58:02,703 --> 00:58:05,943
I have the same necklace!

686
00:58:14,103 --> 00:58:18,623
Where did you get this?

687
00:58:18,743 --> 00:58:21,583
- It can't be.
- What?

688
00:58:21,703 --> 00:58:24,823
It's my mother.

689
00:58:33,743 --> 00:58:35,943
Tom, do you have a locket?

690
00:58:36,063 --> 00:58:38,183
- A what?
- A locket, a locket like this one.

691
00:58:38,303 --> 00:58:39,863
No, why?

692
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:41,943
I don't know what's going on,

693
00:58:42,063 --> 00:58:43,543
but if you have a locket,

694
00:58:43,663 --> 00:58:47,783
you need to tell him right now
before he does something terrible.

695
00:58:53,703 --> 00:58:56,703
You all have the same locket?

696
00:58:58,543 --> 00:59:00,183
Well, isn't that just beautiful?

697
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:02,463
Welcome to our nightmare.

698
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:05,263
You know if you put your gun down
for more than two seconds,

699
00:59:05,383 --> 00:59:07,423
maybe we could figure
this whole thing out.

700
00:59:07,543 --> 00:59:11,143
But I guess that's just not
in your vocabulary, is it?

701
00:59:13,063 --> 00:59:15,223
I can't translate all that.

702
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,943
I don't give a fuck
if he understands or not.

703
00:59:18,063 --> 00:59:22,863
Well, what do you
want me to tell him?

704
00:59:23,823 --> 00:59:27,303
Tell him I know
something he doesn't.

705
00:59:31,663 --> 00:59:35,183
What do you know?

706
00:59:36,143 --> 00:59:39,223
How to untie a slipknot.

707
00:59:48,703 --> 00:59:51,223
So who's the woman in the picture?

708
00:59:51,343 --> 00:59:54,623
My mother.

709
00:59:55,063 --> 00:59:58,103
My grandmother.

710
00:59:58,423 --> 01:00:02,183
And my father's name
was Hans Neumann.

711
01:00:03,783 --> 01:00:07,103
No fucking way.

712
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:21,223
What is your birthday?

713
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:25,223
- I don't want to answer that question.
- Tell me the date.

714
01:00:26,223 --> 01:00:29,943
November 11th, 1962.

715
01:00:31,023 --> 01:00:33,263
That's when my baby is due.

716
01:00:33,383 --> 01:00:37,303
Your last name is Cohen.

717
01:00:40,623 --> 01:00:43,223
Your father is Adam Cohen, right?

718
01:00:43,343 --> 01:00:44,983
It was his parents who raised you?

719
01:00:45,103 --> 01:00:47,863
Yes.

720
01:00:47,983 --> 01:00:52,423
So he dies in the war?

721
01:01:07,183 --> 01:01:10,263
We're all related.

722
01:01:11,263 --> 01:01:14,023
Don't try passing it off
like I'm your mother, Tom.

723
01:01:14,143 --> 01:01:17,623
- Because that's bullshit.
- Believe it.

724
01:01:17,743 --> 01:01:19,823
Fuck that!

725
01:01:19,943 --> 01:01:22,623
I ain't no mother.

726
01:01:22,743 --> 01:01:25,663
You don't even have a locket.

727
01:01:25,783 --> 01:01:29,743
I did have a locket.
I just never kept it.

728
01:01:29,863 --> 01:01:33,143
No, you see now you're just
saying things just to say them.

729
01:01:33,263 --> 01:01:35,543
See, I'm not pregnant

730
01:01:35,663 --> 01:01:37,623
and I never even plan to be, ever.

731
01:01:37,743 --> 01:01:40,663
Maybe not now,
but definitely this year.

732
01:01:40,783 --> 01:01:42,903
No, I vowed never
to have children!

733
01:01:43,023 --> 01:01:46,303
I want nothing to do
with them, ever.

734
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:49,743
Yeah, I noticed
when I was four days old

735
01:01:49,863 --> 01:01:51,703
and I was put up for adoption.

736
01:01:51,823 --> 01:01:53,943
It wasn't me, Tom.
It wasn't me.

737
01:01:54,063 --> 01:01:56,983
I know it wasn't you.
It was the State of South Dakota.

738
01:01:57,103 --> 01:01:58,343
What are you talking about?

739
01:01:58,463 --> 01:02:01,463
My real mother was put to death
for murder and armed robbery.

740
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:04,783
She was robbing liquor stores
and gas stations all over the Midwest.

741
01:02:04,903 --> 01:02:09,743
She shot a cashier. She also shot
and killed my father, Kevin Banks.

742
01:02:09,863 --> 01:02:11,623
- No, you're lying.
- Am I?

743
01:02:11,743 --> 01:02:15,743
Because I was born in South Dakota
Women's Prison on December 12, 1985,

744
01:02:15,863 --> 01:02:18,503
eight months before
she was executed.

745
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:21,943
And the only thing she left me with
was a box of her junk,

746
01:02:22,063 --> 01:02:23,903
including a tiny silver locket

747
01:02:24,023 --> 01:02:26,143
that looked just like this.

748
01:02:26,263 --> 01:02:30,463
So you tell me, Jody. You look me in
the eyes and you tell me if I'm lying.

749
01:02:46,383 --> 01:02:48,503
You said

750
01:02:48,623 --> 01:02:52,263
that your mother died in childbirth?

751
01:02:53,303 --> 01:02:54,903
And Adam?

752
01:02:55,023 --> 01:02:59,023
Your father?

753
01:03:00,183 --> 01:03:04,663
He was killed in Vietnam.

754
01:03:05,183 --> 01:03:06,583
I'm sorry.

755
01:03:06,703 --> 01:03:08,943
What happened to you?

756
01:03:09,063 --> 01:03:11,863
I went to go live with Adam's family

757
01:03:11,983 --> 01:03:15,143
since you didn't have any.

758
01:03:15,983 --> 01:03:20,023
They hated me and I have
the scars to prove it.

759
01:03:21,263 --> 01:03:26,303
- Did he...
- Yeah, Adam's dad was a drinker.

760
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:31,023
And they weren't really
big fans of you either.

761
01:03:31,223 --> 01:03:34,823
I know.

762
01:03:37,103 --> 01:03:39,303
I hated them for that

763
01:03:39,423 --> 01:03:44,143
every day growing up without
even a picture of my mother.

764
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:46,863
So I always kept
the locket close

765
01:03:46,983 --> 01:03:49,903
and I never did find out
what happened to her.

766
01:03:50,023 --> 01:03:53,223
Your grandmother?

767
01:03:54,863 --> 01:03:57,583
She married an American.

768
01:03:57,703 --> 01:04:02,623
They were killed
in a car accident a few years ago.

769
01:04:09,743 --> 01:04:12,863
I'm sorry.

770
01:04:35,383 --> 01:04:39,503
You starting to get the idea
of what's going on around here?

771
01:04:40,783 --> 01:04:46,503
You know, you could help us
figure this whole thing out.

772
01:04:47,023 --> 01:04:50,223
What does this all mean?

773
01:04:50,543 --> 01:04:52,823
The cabin, the bomb shelter,

774
01:04:52,943 --> 01:04:56,183
all this shit?

775
01:05:00,303 --> 01:05:03,903
Fine, suit yourself.

776
01:05:10,543 --> 01:05:14,143
I need five minutes with him.

777
01:05:16,023 --> 01:05:18,783
Five minutes.

778
01:05:30,863 --> 01:05:34,143
It's been five minutes.

779
01:05:39,983 --> 01:05:41,783
What are you doing?

780
01:05:41,903 --> 01:05:44,183
It's okay.
I explained everything to him.

781
01:05:44,303 --> 01:05:46,183
You can't untie him. He's nuts.

782
01:05:46,303 --> 01:05:47,863
No, I won't have him tied up.

783
01:05:47,983 --> 01:05:49,783
He doesn't think
we're related, okay?

784
01:05:49,903 --> 01:05:53,503
- He thinks we're all crazy.
- He is my father!

785
01:05:54,423 --> 01:05:56,943
Please.

786
01:05:57,263 --> 01:06:00,383
Trust me.

787
01:06:10,183 --> 01:06:14,423
I'm untying you because I believe

788
01:06:14,543 --> 01:06:19,743
that you, Hans Neumann,
are my father,

789
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:25,903
and that I am your daughter.

790
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:29,103
I'm going to trust you,

791
01:06:29,223 --> 01:06:35,263
and I can only hope
that you learn to trust us too.

792
01:07:25,423 --> 01:07:27,783
What the fuck?
You're just letting him get away.

793
01:07:27,903 --> 01:07:31,743
I don't think he'll get very far.

794
01:07:36,823 --> 01:07:38,583
My husband is in the army.

795
01:07:38,703 --> 01:07:40,943
He's overseas.

796
01:07:41,063 --> 01:07:42,743
I'm all alone.

797
01:07:42,863 --> 01:07:46,623
There's something wrong
with my baby.

798
01:07:47,383 --> 01:07:49,223
You should know that I dreamt it.

799
01:07:49,343 --> 01:07:50,623
You dreamt what?

800
01:07:50,743 --> 01:07:54,943
I dreamt I died in childbirth.

801
01:07:55,063 --> 01:07:58,903
I was all alone because
Adam was overseas.

802
01:08:00,183 --> 01:08:03,663
The ambulance didn't
make it in time.

803
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:09,783
I had a dream too.

804
01:08:09,903 --> 01:08:11,423
What kind of dream?

805
01:08:11,543 --> 01:08:15,223
About a priest who wronged me.

806
01:08:16,303 --> 01:08:19,063
I shot him,

807
01:08:19,183 --> 01:08:22,663
then I shot myself.

808
01:08:29,103 --> 01:08:31,383
I dreamt that
I was being executed

809
01:08:31,503 --> 01:08:34,263
for murdering Kevin.

810
01:08:34,383 --> 01:08:36,943
We all dreamt our death.

811
01:08:37,063 --> 01:08:39,183
No,

812
01:08:39,303 --> 01:08:42,863
we all dreamt our futures.

813
01:08:43,663 --> 01:08:46,023
None of this has happened yet.

814
01:08:46,143 --> 01:08:49,383
We can change it.
We can stop it.

815
01:08:49,703 --> 01:08:53,023
That's gotta be
a reason why we're here.

816
01:08:53,263 --> 01:08:58,423
Samantha, didn't you say your dad
was killed during an air-strike?

817
01:08:59,503 --> 01:09:02,143
What were the circumstances
regarding his death?

818
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:04,463
He was killed

819
01:09:04,583 --> 01:09:06,223
when he lost contact
with his unit.

820
01:09:06,343 --> 01:09:08,463
He was supposed to be
locating rebels on the border.

821
01:09:08,583 --> 01:09:12,023
- That's all I know.
- Okay, so where did your father die?

822
01:09:12,143 --> 01:09:14,543
In Wielun.

823
01:09:14,663 --> 01:09:17,903
This is the cabin
and this is the bomb shelter.

824
01:09:18,023 --> 01:09:21,303
It's on the edge
of the bubble, right here.

825
01:09:21,623 --> 01:09:24,823
If we're here,
then today's the day.

826
01:09:24,943 --> 01:09:27,903
And we're all about to die.

827
01:09:31,383 --> 01:09:32,903
Maybe we're all about to live.

828
01:09:33,023 --> 01:09:35,423
What do you mean?

829
01:09:35,543 --> 01:09:38,023
Hear me out.

830
01:09:38,143 --> 01:09:40,383
For whatever reason,

831
01:09:40,503 --> 01:09:42,743
we have a chance
to make sure he doesn't die.

832
01:09:42,863 --> 01:09:45,823
If he lives, then your mother
will never remarry.

833
01:09:45,943 --> 01:09:48,383
And if she never remarries,

834
01:09:48,503 --> 01:09:51,703
maybe she's with you
while Adam's over in Vietnam.

835
01:09:51,823 --> 01:09:55,623
She drives you to the hospital.
You don't die during childbirth.

836
01:09:55,743 --> 01:09:58,943
That would mean
Jody grows up with a mother.

837
01:09:59,063 --> 01:10:03,103
Maybe she doesn't
turn out so bad after all.

838
01:10:03,543 --> 01:10:06,663
Maybe I grow up
with a real mother.

839
01:10:11,663 --> 01:10:13,263
It's a stretch.

840
01:10:13,383 --> 01:10:15,503
It's all I've got.

841
01:10:15,623 --> 01:10:18,023
Yeah, it's also insane!

842
01:10:22,303 --> 01:10:24,543
- Jody?
- What?

843
01:10:24,663 --> 01:10:27,383
Your scar.

844
01:10:27,503 --> 01:10:30,263
What about it?

845
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:35,983
It's gone.

846
01:10:36,103 --> 01:10:37,743
We're changing things.

847
01:10:37,863 --> 01:10:40,623
We have to make sure
Hans is in the bomb shelter

848
01:10:40,743 --> 01:10:44,583
- when the air-strike happens.
- Yeah.

849
01:10:45,983 --> 01:10:48,943
Fuck it. I'm in.

850
01:10:51,543 --> 01:10:53,983
Hans?

851
01:10:56,263 --> 01:10:57,623
We're on your side.

852
01:10:57,743 --> 01:10:59,543
Don't come any closer.

853
01:10:59,663 --> 01:11:01,823
I don't want to hurt any of you.

854
01:11:01,943 --> 01:11:05,263
Let me go,
so I can follow my orders.

855
01:11:05,383 --> 01:11:07,823
He says he must follow his orders.

856
01:11:13,263 --> 01:11:15,103
Fuck the mission, Hans!

857
01:11:15,223 --> 01:11:18,623
There's something bigger
happening out here.

858
01:11:21,383 --> 01:11:24,943
They think...
they think he failed his mission.

859
01:11:25,063 --> 01:11:27,983
They're going ahead
with the bombing.

860
01:11:28,103 --> 01:11:31,183
Hello? Hello? Hello?

861
01:11:31,303 --> 01:11:33,903
- It's not working.
- Sam!

862
01:11:34,663 --> 01:11:37,103
Samantha!

863
01:11:38,223 --> 01:11:40,983
Tell him, tell him!

864
01:11:41,103 --> 01:11:43,223
Halt!

865
01:11:43,343 --> 01:11:46,063
Don't come any closer.

866
01:11:46,423 --> 01:11:49,663
If you go through
with your mission, you will die,

867
01:11:49,783 --> 01:11:54,463
and when you die, you will be
responsible for our fates.

868
01:11:54,583 --> 01:11:56,743
I must complete my mission.

869
01:11:56,863 --> 01:11:58,583
The Germans aren't
gonna win this war.

870
01:11:58,703 --> 01:12:01,023
No, Tom.
See, maybe he's supposed to die.

871
01:12:01,143 --> 01:12:02,543
No! No, we're here to save him.

872
01:12:02,663 --> 01:12:04,223
No, Tom, that's what
you want, okay?

873
01:12:04,343 --> 01:12:06,783
Maybe this is about
something bigger... bigger than us.

874
01:12:06,903 --> 01:12:09,543
Bigger than this fucking Nazi!

875
01:12:11,223 --> 01:12:15,543
He says he's not a Nazi.
He's a soldier.

876
01:12:15,943 --> 01:12:17,663
Hans, you have to stay with us!

877
01:12:17,783 --> 01:12:19,199
If you don't come with us,
you're gonna die!

878
01:12:19,223 --> 01:12:21,983
Get out of my way!

879
01:12:30,423 --> 01:12:33,503
No, Tom!

880
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,943
No!

881
01:12:43,423 --> 01:12:47,823
No! Jody! Oh, my God.

882
01:12:47,943 --> 01:12:50,623
Jody! Oh, my God.

883
01:12:50,743 --> 01:12:52,983
Oh, my God.

884
01:13:02,143 --> 01:13:04,983
Shit, her scar's back.

885
01:13:07,623 --> 01:13:09,823
Sam! Sam, Sam,
we need your help.

886
01:13:09,943 --> 01:13:11,503
You need to put
pressure here, okay?

887
01:13:11,623 --> 01:13:13,503
Put your hands here.
I need your help.

888
01:13:13,623 --> 01:13:17,903
- It's okay.
- You can't let her die, okay?

889
01:13:19,303 --> 01:13:21,623
If she dies,

890
01:13:21,743 --> 01:13:24,783
I don't exist.

891
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:27,783
What do you mean?

892
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:30,183
If she dies...

893
01:13:30,303 --> 01:13:33,863
You'll disappear.

894
01:13:35,023 --> 01:13:36,703
Save Hans. Save Hans.

895
01:13:36,823 --> 01:13:39,063
- I will, I will.
- Save Hans.

896
01:13:39,183 --> 01:13:41,303
I'll save him.
I'll save us.

897
01:13:41,423 --> 01:13:43,343
Tom, Tom, Tom.

898
01:13:43,463 --> 01:13:45,263
If you save Hans, then then

899
01:13:45,383 --> 01:13:47,703
then maybe neither of you will exist.

900
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:50,423
Maybe I'll never meet Adam.
Maybe... maybe

901
01:13:50,543 --> 01:13:53,823
I know.

902
01:14:03,383 --> 01:14:06,343
Oh, my God.

903
01:14:08,023 --> 01:14:12,023
Hans! Hans!

904
01:14:18,823 --> 01:14:21,463
Hans!

905
01:14:22,623 --> 01:14:25,343
It's okay. It's okay.

906
01:14:25,543 --> 01:14:26,983
Hans!

907
01:14:27,103 --> 01:14:29,623
It's okay.

908
01:14:37,743 --> 01:14:40,623
Hans!

909
01:14:44,103 --> 01:14:47,503
Okay, stay with me.
Stay with me.

910
01:14:53,183 --> 01:14:56,383
Don't.

911
01:15:57,863 --> 01:16:00,663
Pac-Man.

912
01:16:22,983 --> 01:16:25,903
No, no!

913
01:17:23,943 --> 01:17:26,463
You did this!
You did this!

914
01:17:26,583 --> 01:17:30,183
You killed them!
Don't you understand me?

915
01:17:35,543 --> 01:17:38,823
We have to go to the bunker.

916
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:46,703
If you die, she dies.

917
01:17:46,823 --> 01:17:51,063
My mother, your wife.

918
01:17:51,183 --> 01:17:53,663
Do you understand?

919
01:17:53,863 --> 01:18:00,663
Save yourself for her. For me.

920
01:18:06,103 --> 01:18:09,023
Hurry!

921
01:20:28,223 --> 01:20:31,543
Miss? Miss?

922
01:20:32,183 --> 01:20:35,303
Miss?

923
01:20:35,423 --> 01:20:37,143
Oh, I'm sorry.

924
01:20:37,263 --> 01:20:39,023
Here you go.

925
01:20:39,143 --> 01:20:41,543
Thank you. Oh, miss,

926
01:20:41,663 --> 01:20:45,343
you forgot these.

927
01:20:45,663 --> 01:20:47,783
I'm sorry. I just

928
01:20:47,903 --> 01:20:51,943
I feel so weird,
like I've been here before.

929
01:20:52,063 --> 01:20:55,503
This place has
that effect on people.

930
01:20:55,743 --> 01:20:57,743
Do you need directions
or anything?

931
01:20:57,863 --> 01:21:01,903
Oh, no, I know where I'm going.

932
01:21:02,503 --> 01:21:05,663
Have a good day.

933
01:21:52,863 --> 01:21:55,063
Come on!

934
01:21:55,183 --> 01:21:57,703
No need to yell.
I'll open it.

935
01:21:57,823 --> 01:21:59,943
No tricks up these sleeves.

936
01:22:00,063 --> 01:22:01,103
Keep it that way.

937
01:22:01,223 --> 01:22:03,703
Come on, man.
Give me the fucking money!

938
01:22:05,543 --> 01:22:07,183
Here you go, here you go.

939
01:22:07,303 --> 01:22:08,783
There you go.

940
01:22:08,903 --> 01:22:11,863
The safe.

941
01:22:13,143 --> 01:22:15,343
Damn shame you're living
your life like this.

942
01:22:15,463 --> 01:22:17,103
All the things
you could have done

943
01:22:17,223 --> 01:22:19,103
and you're holding up
a dairy mart for pennies.

944
01:22:19,223 --> 01:22:20,663
I said the safe, right now.

945
01:22:20,783 --> 01:22:22,543
I'll open it,

946
01:22:22,663 --> 01:22:26,423
but I don't think you have
the stomach for what's inside.
